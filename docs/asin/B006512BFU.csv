1510374,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B006512BFU,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","Addiction.  Addiction is a problem that takes on many faces, some of which we all too often ignore or consider overblown.  Sexual addiction.  For those who do not have that problem they may joke that they wish they did.  What is the problem with having a lot of sex?  Why would anyone complain about that?  How could that possibly ruin someone's life?  To those of us who may at one time or another balked at the notion that `sex addicts have it rough' may want to reconsider our perspective, and for that rude awakening we have been handed Steve McQueen's sophomore film, `Shame'.The premise of `Shame' is rather simple.  We have Brandon, a business man who lives alone and has a lot of sex with random strangers he meets in random places.  His sister, Sissy, comes over unannounced and gets permission to sleep on the couch for a while.  Both Sissy and Brandon have deep rooted emotional issues, that obviously stem from a childhood they never discuss, and so they clash like oil and water.  Brandon is seemingly introverted yet blunt and suave, allowing him to take his potential lovers by surprise and sweep them into his bed for a romp.  Sissy is overtly friendly, using her loud personality to omit a confident sexuality that one detects she uses to replace the self-esteem she lost along the way.  Both people are broken fragments of a former self.  McQueen uses this simple premise to exploit the pain welled up inside of these people and uses their addictions as a way to make a profound statement about the powerful hold our own insecurities can have on us.Yes, this is very explicit and yet never once becomes something titillating because the sorrowful overlay completely consumes the film.Much has been made of Michael Fassbender's performance here.  He won the Vulpi Cup (at the Venice Film Festival) early in the year and then steamrolled through critics' awards (with few wins but many mentions) and then was disgustingly snubbed an Oscar nomination.  All that has been said was deserved.  The way that Michael molds the pain and inner demons into the very fabric of Brandon's person is outstanding.  Matching him every step, and maybe even surpassing him a step or two, is the amazing Carey Mulligan (god, how I love this woman).  She embodies Sissy with so much human suffering yet never skips a beat in her sputtering naivety.  Her rendition of `New York, New York' is haunting, but there is so much more to her performance than a mere song.  You can strip the layers from her and find a woman masking so much pain with a song and a dance.  These are two of the bravest performances in recent years.McQueen found a way to make this addiction feel real to the audience, and in doing so he helped open our eyes to the fact that life is much deeper than it may seem.  Brandon's spiral to self-destruction is rendered with such detail that one is touched deeply by it.  Watching him struggle to make a real connection with someone (his failure to perform says so much about the hold the addiction has on him and the root cause of that addiction) or watching Sissy plead for love with tearful desperation is hard to stomach at times but expertly used to address the themes at hand.Yes, I understand that some have balked at the depiction of the gay-club and the fact that it is depicted as a mortal sin of sorts, but I think that taken into context it makes sense in a way, considering that the addiction has brought Brandon to a place he never expected it to.Regardless of any small quibbles (which I have none), there is no denying the power behind each and every frame.",5,Shame is a powerfully destructive force...,1343088000,"07 24, 2012",2012,3586,"['Addiction', 'Addiction', 'problem', 'many', 'too', 'often', 'ignore', 'consider', 'overblown', 'Sexual', 'addiction', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'problem', 'may', 'joke', 'wish', 'did', 'What', 'problem', 'having', 'lot', 'sex', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'complain', 'How', 'could', 'possibly', 'someone', 'life', 'who', 'may', 'one', 'time', 'balked', 'notion', 'sex', 'addicts', 'have', 'may', 'want', 'reconsider', 'perspective', 'rude', 'awakening', 'have', 'been', 'handed', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'sophomore', 'film', ""Shame'.The"", 'premise', 'Shame', 'rather', 'simple', 'have', 'Brandon', 'business', 'man', 'who', 'alone', 'lot', 'sex', 'random', 'strangers', 'random', 'places', 'sister', 'Sissy', 'unannounced', 'permission', 'sleep', 'couch', 'while', 'Sissy', 'Brandon', 'have', 'deep', 'rooted', 'emotional', 'issues', 'obviously', 'stem', 'childhood', 'never', 'discuss', 'so', 'clash', 'oil', 'water', 'Brandon', 'seemingly', 'introverted', 'yet', 'blunt', 'suave', 'allowing', 'take', 'potential', 'lovers', 'surprise', 'sweep', 'bed', 'romp', 'Sissy', 'overtly', 'friendly', 'using', 'loud', 'personality', 'omit', 'confident', 'sexuality', 'one', 'replace', 'self-esteem', 'lost', 'way', 'people', 'are', 'broken', 'fragments', 'former', 'self', 'McQueen', 'simple', 'premise', 'exploit', 'pain', 'welled', 'up', 'people', 'addictions', 'way', 'make', 'profound', 'statement', 'powerful', 'hold', 'own', 'insecurities', 'can', 'have', 'us.Yes', 'very', 'explicit', 'yet', 'never', 'once', 'something', 'titillating', 'sorrowful', 'overlay', 'completely', 'film.Much', 'been', 'made', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'performance', 'here', 'won', 'Vulpi', 'Cup', 'Venice', 'Film', 'Festival', 'early', 'year', 'then', 'steamrolled', 'critics', 'awards', 'few', 'wins', 'many', 'mentions', 'then', 'was', 'disgustingly', 'snubbed', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'been', 'said', 'was', 'deserved', 'way', 'Michael', 'molds', 'pain', 'inner', 'demons', 'very', 'fabric', 'Brandon', 'person', 'outstanding', 'Matching', 'step', 'maybe', 'even', 'surpassing', 'step', 'two', 'amazing', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'god', 'how', 'love', 'woman', 'Sissy', 'so', 'much', 'human', 'suffering', 'yet', 'never', 'beat', 'sputtering', 'naivety', 'rendition', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'haunting', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'performance', 'mere', 'song', 'can', 'strip', 'layers', 'find', 'woman', 'masking', 'so', 'much', 'pain', 'song', 'dance', 'are', 'two', 'bravest', 'performances', 'recent', 'years.McQueen', 'found', 'way', 'make', 'addiction', 'feel', 'real', 'audience', 'doing', 'so', 'helped', 'open', 'eyes', 'fact', 'life', 'much', 'deeper', 'may', 'seem', 'Brandon', 'spiral', 'self-destruction', 'rendered', 'such', 'detail', 'one', 'touched', 'deeply', 'Watching', 'struggle', 'make', 'real', 'connection', 'someone', 'failure', 'perform', 'so', 'much', 'hold', 'addiction', 'root', 'cause', 'addiction', 'watching', 'Sissy', 'plead', 'love', 'tearful', 'desperation', 'hard', 'stomach', 'times', 'expertly', 'used', 'address', 'themes', 'hand.Yes', 'understand', 'have', 'balked', 'depiction', 'gay-club', 'fact', 'depicted', 'mortal', 'sin', 'sorts', 'think', 'taken', 'context', 'sense', 'way', 'considering', 'addiction', 'brought', 'Brandon', 'place', 'never', 'expected', 'to.Regardless', 'small', 'quibbles', 'have', 'none', 'denying', 'power', 'frame']",Shame Region 2

In spite of the front cover and the information on the Amazon web page, digital copies are not available for Apple devices (iPad, iPhone, iTunes, etc).  You will have to pay an additional $15 to iTunes to get the promised digital copy.When I complained to Fox I was told I was not deceived because there was a tiny green box on the back that said Android Market.  I needed a magnifying glass to read it; there was something above 'Android Market' but it was too small to actually print.  There is a larger graphic on the back that is the same as the one they use for digital copies that can be used by Apple products and that graphic includes a iPhone![The software on their DVD used to download digital copies with a Mac is actually there and loads--it just won't download for Apple products!  So it took me a while to figure out I wasn't doing anything wrong and that my computer was ok.]Even if there were a visible label, 'Android Market', it would not mean Apple products are not supported.  And nowhere on the box does it state that Apple products are not supported.  They were supported in the past and there is that picture of an iPhone.Obviously, there is no way to read the green box if you buy Blu-Ray's at Amazon or any other mail order source.  Or if you shop in brick & mortar stores without a magnifying glass.  Beware of future Fox' digital copies.  It would probably be a good idea to call Amazon or Fox to find out what is included in the package.The film gets 4 stars;  the Blu-Ray, DVD, Digital Copy package gets no stars at all.

1510381,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B006512BFU,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[3, 4]","I don't think anyone could say they enjoyed this movie.  It is so bleak that I doubt that is possible.  However, I believe this is the first film to really show us sexual addiction and what a grim state it is to be a sexual addict.  Michael Fassbinder does a tour de force job in the lead role.  He performs graphic sex throughout the movie and, but for the moment of release, is in pretty much a state of despair throughout it. Probably no one has had so much sex with so many partners and achieved so little satisfaction from it.  The movie at no point presents a rehab moment to soften its punch either.  This shows you the disease, not the cure, if there even is one.Carey Mulligan plays his sister who is adrift too but more in the way of where she is in life and her lack of prospects.  She does realize that one should want a relationship and friends which our lead does not. Ironically, he leads the most sterile existence it is possible to lead.  He goes from his blue tinged gray office to his blue tinged gray apartment.  He does his work at work and at home he does his sex, watches cartoons, eats or sleeps.  He has absolutely no interest in anything else. He can barely carry on a conversation which does not veer into sex.  When he tries to have a real date with a woman who is not a prostitute, it is a catastrophe.  He only can carry on with prostitutes or the female equivalents of himself, mainly married women on the prowl.This is well written, well directed, superbly acted BUT is stark and grim.  So if you are looking for a nice way to relax after work over a movie, I doubt this will fit the bill. I would be very surprised if you even considered the graphic content as capable of taking you out of the grim state of the film.

1510382,A2IWSO5TUUDXUU,B006512BFU,"Catmandu ""catmndu""","[1, 1]","I have seen Hunger, and enjoyed it immensely.  McQueen's movies don't insult one's intelligence the way other arty movies try to do.  There are pockets of information left out of his storylines; however he leaves the viewer to fill in those gaps as they wish to.  Sort of like those &#34;choose your own ending&#34; books I read as a kid.  In the end, the gaps don't take away from the story and don't really matter.With that being said, Steve's movies are the kind an individual can stomach once, so pay attention the first time around.  Hunger was difficult to watch at times, but Shame really took that to the next level.

The idea of this movie was obvious immediately, and then we have another hour or so watching a sad, DAMAGED in 30-point font man and a manic pixie dreamgirl (look up the phrase) gone stereotypically wrong. I knew when I saw the scene where Sissy, as tremulous and fragile as a moth wing, sang ""New York, New York"" that critics would fall all over themselves in praise, but I could only roll my eyes at the silliness of it--the CLICHE of it and think ""of course she sang THAT song. And of COURSE that way."". This movie reminded me not of American Psycho, as some have said--mainly because Christian Bale kept a small wink of joy in the role--but more like ""In The Company of Men"", where miserable people just were relentlessly miserable, letting nothing breathe. I mean, come ON. Even traumatized (oooo possibly incestuous--another cliche alert!!) siblings can let a little air into their dialog. I found more life and realism in the subway flirtation scene than I did the whole movie; it underscored little victories we get from reading signs that someone is physically interested and seemed (to me) why sex addiction is a real addiction and not just something to numb pain. That scene was the difference between an alcholic being shown having ""just a little more"" versus a ham-fisted performance of the actor looking tormented, up-ending a whole bottle of scotch.

1510384,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B006512BFU,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 2]","This film offers a very realistic picture of sexual addiction.  However it is also a tragic film as we see a very dysfunctional brother and sister as they each suffer in very different ways with a mysterious past, a barren present, and a hopeless future. Michael Fassbender repeatedly demonstrates that he is a superb actor, probably the best currently in films. Carey Mulligan offers a performance that is awesome as she portrays a very damaged young woman, trying to connect, driven by helpless dependency. Fassbinder plays a young New York businessman who deals with anxiety and emergence of painful thoughts or memories by changing his consciousness through sexual arousal and orgasm. Sexual arousal will temporarily divert him from disturbed thoughts or painful memories and his sexual behaviors have now become a standard escape from his thoughts. He shares a dark history with his younger sister, Sissy, and whereas they may be all each other has in the world, they evoke compulsions and negative emotions that makes this brother and sister relationship very dysfunctional. Mulligan's performance is tops.Director Steve McQueen has created a winner. The actors are flawless. The soundtrack uses a mixture of classical and pop that makes the film contemporary and yet contemplative.  The portion of the soundtrack written specifically for the film is excellent and evokes the tragic presence of Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings. Like Barber's Adagio, the soundtrack conveys a sense of deterministic tragedy.In understanding sexual addiction, it is important to realize that the compulsive rituals of searching for sex, having sex, and having orgasm that help the compulsive escape the unpleasant memories or thoughts.  This film demonstrates that better than anything I have seen regarding compulsive and addictive behavior.This is also an intelligent film, never filling in the gaps but allowing the audience just enough information to make sense of the characters and the action. If you like films where all the parts come together, where all mysteries are explained, where there are no gaps left to the imagination, then this is not the film for you.Whatever happened to Brandon in his youth, he seems unable to form meaningful relationships and he undermines relationships that inch toward real intimacy. His sister seeks intimacy with him but she uses sexuality to gain intimacy which is exactly what he does not need in a familial relationship. They are locked in a dangerous dysfunctional relationship which Brandon dreads and avoids if possible. The film has considerable sexual content, in fact the most sexual content I have seen in a film in a very long time. However it was absolutely essential to the film since it shows Brandon sexually acting out to avoid his own thoughts and feelings. Fassbender does an outstanding job in a difficult role.

1510387,AZZHSA4KMGXG7,B006512BFU,chubbagrubb,"[0, 3]","After hearing a lot of great things about Shame, I have to say I came away from it slightly disappointed. The story follows sex-addict Brandon Sullivan (Michael Fassbender), whose mundane and brutal existence is interrupted by the arrival of his sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan). The film exposes the sordid underbelly of Manhattan and follows the breakdown of the relationship between the two siblings, as Brandon becomes increasingly irritated and suffocated by Sissy's presence.McQueen purposely leaves out the protagonists' back-story, leaving it up to the viewer to imagine what 'shameful' upbringing led to their neurotic and isolated adult lives. The problem I had with this was that it was hard to feel any sort of empathy for the siblings as they unravelled desperately throughout the film, or to feel any emotional response towards them by the end. Thus when Sissy did her (agonisingly) slow rendition of `New York, New York' which brings Brandon to tears, I was left emotionally cold and slightly bored. Also, although I found the majority of the sex-scenes important in revealing Brandon's desires and motivations, I found myself really irritated by the final threesome, which dragged on forever and seemed entirely gratuitous. I was not convinced by the casting choice of having Mulligan play Sissy, as I did not find her quite manic or desperate enough and she appeared slightly one-dimensional throughout.Having said that, there were a lot of great moments in the film - Fassbender's acting was phenomenal throughout and the film was well-paced and shot beautifully - showing the gritty underside of urban life and the cold, bare monotonous routine of Brandon's sex-obsessed existence. The relationship between Sissy and Brandon was compelling (and uncomfortable) to watch; plagued by need, anger and incestuous desire. The most interesting parts of the film were the scenes between Brandon and his recently separated co-worker, Marianne, as they debated the point of monogamy in modern life, and eventually embarked on a doomed sexual encounter. Although I thought the film had its flaws, Steve McQueen's directorial style was unique, beautifully real and definitely thought-provoking, which made them somewhat forgivable.",3,A bit disappointing,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,2236,"['hearing', 'lot', 'great', 'things', 'Shame', 'have', 'say', 'came', 'away', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'story', 'sex-addict', 'Brandon', 'Sullivan', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'mundane', 'brutal', 'existence', 'interrupted', 'arrival', 'sister', 'Sissy', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'film', 'sordid', 'underbelly', 'Manhattan', 'breakdown', 'relationship', 'two', 'siblings', 'Brandon', 'increasingly', 'irritated', 'suffocated', 'Sissy', 'presence.McQueen', 'purposely', 'out', 'protagonists', 'back-story', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'imagine', 'what', ""'shameful"", 'upbringing', 'led', 'neurotic', 'isolated', 'adult', 'lives', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'was', 'hard', 'feel', 'sort', 'empathy', 'siblings', 'unravelled', 'desperately', 'film', 'feel', 'emotional', 'response', 'towards', 'end', 'Thus', 'when', 'Sissy', 'did', 'agonisingly', 'slow', 'rendition', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'Brandon', 'tears', 'was', 'left', 'emotionally', 'cold', 'slightly', 'bored', 'Also', 'found', 'majority', 'sex-scenes', 'important', 'revealing', 'Brandon', 'desires', 'motivations', 'found', 'really', 'irritated', 'final', 'threesome', 'dragged', 'forever', 'seemed', 'entirely', 'gratuitous', 'was', 'not', 'convinced', 'casting', 'choice', 'having', 'Mulligan', 'play', 'Sissy', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'quite', 'manic', 'desperate', 'enough', 'appeared', 'slightly', 'one-dimensional', 'throughout.Having', 'said', 'were', 'lot', 'great', 'moments', 'film', 'Fassbender', 'acting', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'film', 'was', 'well-paced', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'showing', 'gritty', 'underside', 'urban', 'life', 'cold', 'bare', 'monotonous', 'routine', 'Brandon', 'sex-obsessed', 'existence', 'relationship', 'Sissy', 'Brandon', 'was', 'compelling', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'plagued', 'need', 'anger', 'incestuous', 'desire', 'most', 'interesting', 'parts', 'film', 'were', 'scenes', 'Brandon', 'recently', 'separated', 'co-worker', 'Marianne', 'debated', 'point', 'monogamy', 'modern', 'life', 'eventually', 'embarked', 'doomed', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'thought', 'film', 'had', 'flaws', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'directorial', 'style', 'was', 'unique', 'beautifully', 'real', 'definitely', 'thought-provoking', 'made', 'somewhat', 'forgivable']",Shame Region 2

1510391,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B006512BFU,CriticNic,"[5, 6]","Back when I watched Hunger, I recall being extremely moved by both the subject matter and the tragically beautiful imagery from director Steve McQueen. For his second feature, McQueen again tackles a controversial subject and relies on the use images and feelings to capture it.McQueen wisely uses his star from Hunger in Shame. Michael Fassbender plays Brandon, a successful and attractive New Yorker struggling with sex addiction. What I loved about Fassbender in Hunger was that he really was able to evoke so much feeling without having to speak, something not many actors can do well. In Shame he is able to achieve the same effect, with each look conveying a multitude of emotions.The character of Brandon lives a fairly routine life. Apart from his seemingly successful career and a normal social life involving having drinks at upscale cocktail bars, we're shown a more up-close look at his life of a sex addict, a darker side that he shields off from the outside world. He masturbates frequently, constantly looks at pornography, and has sex with girls from the bar to call-girls. While parts of that may sound like the life of an oversexed college student, here it's anything but funny or glorified.Brandon's routine is disrupted when he's paid an unexpected (and unwanted) visit from his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan). From the moment Brandon plays and ignores messages on his answering machine from Sissy to her arrival in his apartment, we wonder why he's so heartless towards his sister. As the film progresses, there are hints that they have experienced painful childhoods, though nothing more is ever revealed.The dysfunctional relationship of Sissy and Brandon is a puzzling one, which leaves us wanting to know more. Every interaction they have, whether it be a look across a room or an uncomfortable heated exchange with a naked Brandon on top of Sissy, we can tell there's a lot to know. The two actors do a great job of keeping the drama believable and McQueen does an equally great job of not spelling things out for us while keeping things interesting.Brandon also meets a woman named Marianne (Nicole Beharie) who causes an additional a stir in Brandon's life. She seems different than his usual encounters. Is he capable of a real relationship? This is one of many questions I asked myself. Between Sissy and Marianne, Brandon finds himself facing some personal dilemmas that we gather he's not at all used to. The ensuing drama had me feeling all sorts of emotions, but by the end I did begin to feel a little bit of hope.Most people will be talking about this film for its graphic sex scenes, but the film really is first and foremost a psychological drama. Brandon is a very enigmatic and fascinating character whose every action has our attention. Initially, he kind of seems like a mere pervert, but as the film progresses I really started to realize and try to understand his disease. Sex addiction is often joked about, but if there are people like Brandon out there, I think it's something that deserves to be taken seriously.In addition to being psychologically stimulating material, Shame is also superbly crafted in such a way that each scene captures the essence of the characters and their moods. Much like Hunger, Shame doesn't just look pretty, but the gorgeous shots also say something about each scene. From a simple back-and-forth scene with Brandon and Sissy while Sissy sings in a restaurant, to a tracking shot with Brandon running, I felt closer to the characters without them having to even do much of anything.Shame does for erotica what Drive did for car movies. While Shame has some otherwise steamy sex scenes, in context they're rather not sexy at all. The film is about more than the sex, Shame is a character study about a man and his internal struggles. To simply write this film off as an erotic escapade would be unfortunate. While the film is often difficult to watch and leaves us with more questions than answers, it's a fascinating drama with a lot to appreciate.Source: criticnic.com 21-April-2012Disclosure: Film sent by 20th Century Fox",4,Fascinatingly dark character study,1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,4101,"['Back', 'when', 'watched', 'Hunger', 'recall', 'being', 'extremely', 'moved', 'subject', 'matter', 'tragically', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'director', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'second', 'feature', 'McQueen', 'again', 'controversial', 'subject', 'relies', 'use', 'images', 'feelings', 'capture', 'it.McQueen', 'wisely', 'star', 'Hunger', 'Shame', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'Brandon', 'successful', 'attractive', 'New', 'Yorker', 'struggling', 'sex', 'addiction', 'What', 'loved', 'about', 'Fassbender', 'Hunger', 'was', 'really', 'was', 'able', 'evoke', 'so', 'much', 'feeling', 'having', 'speak', 'something', 'not', 'many', 'actors', 'can', 'do', 'well', 'Shame', 'able', 'achieve', 'same', 'effect', 'look', 'conveying', 'multitude', 'emotions.The', 'character', 'Brandon', 'fairly', 'routine', 'life', 'Apart', 'seemingly', 'successful', 'career', 'normal', 'social', 'life', 'involving', 'having', 'drinks', 'upscale', 'cocktail', 'bars', ""'re"", 'shown', 'more', 'up-close', 'look', 'life', 'sex', 'addict', 'darker', 'side', 'shields', 'off', 'outside', 'world', 'frequently', 'constantly', 'pornography', 'sex', 'girls', 'bar', 'call-girls', 'parts', 'may', 'sound', 'life', 'oversexed', 'college', 'student', 'here', 'anything', 'funny', 'glorified.Brandon', 'routine', 'disrupted', 'when', 'paid', 'unexpected', 'unwanted', 'visit', 'sister', 'Sissy', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'moment', 'Brandon', 'plays', 'ignores', 'messages', 'answering', 'machine', 'Sissy', 'arrival', 'apartment', 'wonder', 'why', 'so', 'heartless', 'sister', 'film', 'are', 'hints', 'have', 'experienced', 'painful', 'childhoods', 'nothing', 'more', 'ever', 'revealed.The', 'dysfunctional', 'relationship', 'Sissy', 'Brandon', 'puzzling', 'one', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'interaction', 'have', 'be', 'look', 'room', 'uncomfortable', 'heated', 'exchange', 'naked', 'Brandon', 'top', 'Sissy', 'can', 'tell', 'lot', 'know', 'two', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'keeping', 'drama', 'believable', 'McQueen', 'equally', 'great', 'job', 'not', 'spelling', 'things', 'out', 'keeping', 'things', 'interesting.Brandon', 'also', 'woman', 'named', 'Marianne', 'Nicole', 'Beharie', 'who', 'additional', 'stir', 'Brandon', 'life', 'different', 'usual', 'encounters', 'capable', 'real', 'relationship', 'one', 'many', 'questions', 'asked', 'Between', 'Sissy', 'Marianne', 'Brandon', 'facing', 'personal', 'dilemmas', 'gather', 'not', 'used', 'ensuing', 'drama', 'had', 'feeling', 'sorts', 'emotions', 'end', 'did', 'begin', 'feel', 'little', 'bit', 'hope.Most', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'talking', 'film', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'film', 'really', 'first', 'foremost', 'psychological', 'drama', 'Brandon', 'very', 'enigmatic', 'fascinating', 'character', 'action', 'attention', 'Initially', 'kind', 'mere', 'pervert', 'film', 'really', 'started', 'realize', 'try', 'understand', 'disease', 'Sex', 'addiction', 'often', 'joked', 'are', 'people', 'Brandon', 'there', 'think', 'something', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously.In', 'addition', 'being', 'psychologically', 'stimulating', 'material', 'Shame', 'also', 'superbly', 'crafted', 'such', 'way', 'scene', 'essence', 'characters', 'moods', 'Much', 'Hunger', 'Shame', ""n't"", 'just', 'look', 'pretty', 'gorgeous', 'shots', 'also', 'say', 'something', 'scene', 'simple', 'back-and-forth', 'scene', 'Brandon', 'Sissy', 'Sissy', 'sings', 'restaurant', 'tracking', 'shot', 'Brandon', 'running', 'felt', 'closer', 'characters', 'having', 'even', 'do', 'much', 'anything.Shame', 'erotica', 'what', 'Drive', 'did', 'car', 'movies', 'Shame', 'otherwise', 'steamy', 'sex', 'scenes', 'context', ""'re"", 'rather', 'not', 'sexy', 'film', 'more', 'sex', 'Shame', 'character', 'study', 'man', 'internal', 'struggles', 'simply', 'write', 'film', 'off', 'erotic', 'escapade', 'would', 'be', 'unfortunate', 'film', 'often', 'difficult', 'watch', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'fascinating', 'drama', 'lot', 'appreciate.Source', 'criticnic.com', '21-April-2012Disclosure', 'Film', 'sent', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox']",Shame Region 2
1510392,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B006512BFU,DanD,"[5, 6]","This is the story of two struggling people: sex addict Brandon and his emotionally dependent sister Sissy.  When the latter shows up out of the blue (well, after leaving countless distressing messages on Brandon's answering machine), the pair must cope with their own messed up lives.  And, like most people, they don't cope very well at all.There isn't much plot in SHAME.  It's a slow-moving character study.  It's also not for everyone.  The NC-17 rating isn't much for the content (we've seen more graphic stuff in R-rated films), but for the way the content is handled: unflinchingly, without judgement, without condemnation, and perhaps with a tad bit of understanding.  Director/writer Steve McQueen makes frequent use of extended shots; this adds and aura of unease to even the film's more beautiful moments (a real-time take of Carey Mulligan singing ""New York, New York"" is most memorable).  The script is intelligent, and never belittles its characters; nor does it put them up on some pedestal of victimhood and pity.  It's simply an honest take on two incredibly realistic individuals.None of that would be possible, of course, without the right actors.  Thankfully, both Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan have proven themselves worthy of the job.  They deliver their best performances here; the bravery isn't necessarily in their willingness to bare it all before the camera, but in the off-handed way they do so.  The relationship between Brandon and Sissy is incredibly strained and at times uncomfortable; Fassbender and Mulligan don't shy away from this, but instead embrace it and swing for the fences.  These are truly award-worthy performances; the film's edgy content may have scares away the Academy Awards, but actors of this caliber don't really care.  There will be awards for Fassbender and Mulligan some day.  Right now, they give gripping, memorable performances in a film that is a must-see for anyone who appreciates quality filmmaking, and isn't afraid of stepping outside their emotional comfort zone.",5,"""We're not bad people.

I have no idea who is ashamed or what shame has to do with anything. The film is about a brother and sister. The sister desperately needs her older brother in her life. He can't bear to have her in it - why we never find out. We do learn that she has a history of cutting herself on the arms. And we learn that the brother doesn't want her to stay with him in his apartment because it impinges on his desire to have hookers visit him and to view Internet porn and the like. However, she's a free spirit. She wouldn't care if he had 3 hookers visit every day. She's happy to let men pick her up and have sex in a window everybody from blocks around can watch. But the brother doesn't want his sister to know he likes porn. Now...why would that be? Internet porn is a huge industry around the world. Why hide it from a sister who doesn't mind her brother seeing her stark naked in the shower?I could go on, but the thing is, this picture stinks. It makes absolutely no sense. What it's about is showing very long shots, close-ups, of genitals in the act of sex. You'll see exactly how long Michael Fassbender's penis is, unless it was enhanced by CGI. Some people think Fassbender can act. I don't. But Carey Mulligan is the best young actress working today, and what she's doing in this garbage being thrust into from behind while naked from the front with her breasts flying around is beyond me.The film was written and directed by the no-talent Steve McQueen, who did such a horrendous self-conscious job with 12 Years A Slave. His endless, locked-off shots are so long that Fassbender can begin to masturbate in the shower, you can go masturbate in your shower, and when you come back, Fassbender will still be masturbating in the shower on the same shot. Remember the choral scene in 12 Years A Slave? It began with a very long shot of a female slave just staring. For a long time. Then she began to sing. Very self-conscious and stagey, not filmic at all. Well, at the end of Shame, there's an equally ridiculous shot, very long, with a dramatic action at the end by Fassbender. What the point of it isn't clear. Is he upset about his sister? That he's a bad brother? Who cares? As I said, it's just pornography. There's no story. It's just about filming sex.

Shame is a harrowing, disturbing and unsettling look at what happens when one becomes a slave to his or her addiction.  Michael Fassbender delivers a tour de force performance as a damaged, upwardly mobile sex addict living in Manhattan.  Carey Mulligan, who was also robbed of an oscar nomination, plays Brandon's equally damaged sister and is fantastic as well.  I was horrified, saddened and fascinated watching this incredible work of art.There are many unanswered questions as to what happened between Brandon and his sister when they were younger.  They have a  very disturbing relationship that raises a great deal of questions. Then there are Brandons' sexcapades and  inability to connect on an emotional level.  There is something slightly Patrick Batemanish about Brandon for those of you who have read and seen American Psycho.  The ice cold personality, the impeccable clothes and apartment. Brandon, of course is not a psychotic killer.Some have referred to Brandon as a deviant or monster.  I think not.  This is someone who needs help for emotional problems.  My heart broke when his attempt at having a normal relationship fails in the worst possible way. If you think this film is sex, sex, sex think again. This film is not erotic nor is it sexy. Shame is not an easy film to watch. I remember sitting in the theater and not being able to look at the screen.  The sex is graphic and so is the nudity.  However both are not gratuitous and are tastefully shot.  I studied human behavior for four years in college but the jury was always out on sex addiction.  This film has convinced me. Steve McQueen delivers another masterpiece on par with the magnificent Hunger.

When I saw this film in the theatre, there was a vibe about the audience ... many of the people in the theatre were clearly planning on being titillated, shocked, or turned on by the film. Those people were probably disappointed since, despite plenty of nudity and sexual situations, there was absolutely nothing sexy about this film. Every time Brandon (the central character and sexual addict, bravely and hauntingly portrayed by Michael Fassbender) acts out, it's an act of desperation and a way of numbing the intense pain and alienation that is written all over his face.""We're not bad people, we just come from a bad place,"" says Sissy (Carey Mulligan), Brandon's sister, to her brother in one of the many desperate voicemail messages she leaves him throughout the film. The film's ""elephant in the room,"" which is never spelled out explicitly but is obvious throughout every single scene, is that Brandon and Sissy were both sexually abused as children, probably by their parents. As adults, they are both hopelessly damaged. Brandon seeks constant, compulsive sexual gratification but is completely unable to have an authentic, genuine interaction with another human being. Sissy also acts out sexually, but, unlike Brandon, clings desperately and inappropriately to those around her, as well as self-harms (by cutting).It's hard to give this film a ""grade."" Why? Because it's not a film that is enjoyable to watch on any level. Practically every scene is painful ... you're spending two hours watching two tortured, ruined human beings self-destructing.

why not alcoholism, or gambling, or violence? i'd guess, partly because we've had already a long line of profane and corrupt cops, criminals, loners and losers, so that modern cinema has inured us to these deviances and made their vices seem almost picaresque. i suspect mcqueen chose sexual addiction and emotional dependency because these are inherently ugly and demeaning, difficult to watch and clearly brutalizing and dehumanizing to the protagonists. it's a fine directorial touch that the soundtrack includes some of the more bizarre misinterpretations of j.s. bach's keyboard music recorded by glenn gould, the master of oppressively sterile bach pianism.the film culminates in an episode where brandon's hostility toward his sister dissolves in the panicked realization that he cares for her, and his sobbing collapse on a lonely wharf releases, in me at least, a surge of empathy and compassion for his predicament. and the film closes as it opened, with a married woman blatantly offering herself to brandon on a subway train -- but this time brandon does not eye her with the amused hunger of a predator, but with the wary stare of a man resolved to be free.",5,eros and enslavement,1398988800,"05 2, 2014",2014,3078,"['first', 'very', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'same', 'way', 'mcqueen', 'subsequent', '12', 'years', 'slave', 'difficult', 'watch', 'films', 'see', 'human', 'beings', 'struggling', 'oppression', 'torture', 'here', 'scars', 'self', 'cutting', 'replace', 'welts', 'whipping', 'oppressive', 'atmosphere', 'exploitation', 'amorality', 'same.for', 'brother', 'sister', 'shame', 'oppression', 'somewhere', 'shared', 'past', 'hinted', 'inappropriate', 'mutual', 'nudity', 'story', 'brandon', 'fassbender', 'tells', 'being', 'knocked', 'unconscious', 'brother', 'mother', 'father', 'are', 'never', 'mentioned', 'apartment', 'bare', 'mementos', 'sister', 'arms', 'are', 'tracked', 'self', 'mutilation', 'subtle', 'details', 'convey', 'cavernous', 'hole', 'denial', 'pain', 'result', 'fail', 'intimacy', 'sister', 'boyfriends', 'brother', 'brother', 'sister', 'lovely', 'eager', 'coworker.in', 'same', 'way', 'proud', 'free', 'man', '12', 'years', 'very', 'adept', 'being', 'slave', 'simply', 'order', 'survive', 'siblings', 'here', 'turn', 'emotional', 'bondage', 'artful', 'song', 'enthusiastic', 'pursuit', 'conquest', 'have', 'learned', 'how', 'be', 'good', 'slaves', 'most', 'remarkable', 'aspect', 'film', 'humans', 'can', 'adapt', 'manipulate', 'self', 'imposed', 'bondage', 'same', 'way', 'plantation', 'become', 'clever', 'avoiding', 'whipping', 'fact', 'brandon', 'callow', 'pathetic', 'boss', 'casual', 'adulterer', 'workplace', 'power', 'brandon', 'personal', 'ends', 'including', 'seduction', 'brandon', 'sister', 'brandon', 'apartment', 'brandon', 'next', 'room', 'married', 'women', 'are', 'willing', 'flirt', 'brandon', 'public', 'self', 'imposed', 'enslavement', 'will', 'elect', 'own', 'masters', 'whip', 'hands', 'keep', 'inner', 'bondage', 'firmly', 'place.why', 'sex', 'pornography', 'nudity', 'specific', 'expression', 'emotional', 'bondage', 'why', 'not', 'alcoholism', 'gambling', 'violence', 'i', ""'d"", 'guess', 'partly', ""'ve"", 'had', 'already', 'long', 'line', 'profane', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'criminals', 'loners', 'losers', 'modern', 'cinema', 'inured', 'deviances', 'made', 'vices', 'seem', 'almost', 'picaresque', 'i', 'suspect', 'mcqueen', 'chose', 'sexual', 'addiction', 'emotional', 'dependency', 'are', 'inherently', 'ugly', 'demeaning', 'difficult', 'watch', 'clearly', 'brutalizing', 'dehumanizing', 'protagonists', 'fine', 'directorial', 'touch', 'soundtrack', 'more', 'bizarre', 'misinterpretations', 'j.s', 'bach', 'keyboard', 'music', 'recorded', 'glenn', 'gould', 'master', 'oppressively', 'sterile', 'bach', 'pianism.the', 'film', 'culminates', 'episode', 'where', 'brandon', 'hostility', 'sister', 'dissolves', 'panicked', 'realization', 'sobbing', 'collapse', 'lonely', 'wharf', 'releases', 'least', 'surge', 'empathy', 'compassion', 'predicament', 'film', 'opened', 'married', 'woman', 'blatantly', 'offering', 'brandon', 'subway', 'train', 'time', 'brandon', 'not', 'eye', 'amused', 'hunger', 'predator', 'wary', 'stare', 'man', 'resolved', 'be', 'free']",Shame Region 2
1510402,A3TKLTWVLB43XQ,B006512BFU,"DukeD1989 ""Film Buff""","[4, 6]","""Shame"", Steve McQueen's stark and uncompromising exploration of the devastating effects of sex addiction, is a powerful glimpse into the dark parts of the human soul and how it can consume us. It stars Michael Fassbender as Brandon, viewed by his colleagues as a polite, well-kept business professional, who is secretly struggling with a sex addiction that causes him to seek out sexual release through either girls he meets at bars, escorts or masturbation, often in public bathrooms. In essence he lives in his own erotic world, though the sex is not for pleasure but simply to help block out some deep-seeded pain, which he tries to control with daily routines to keep focus. This world is disrupted when Sissy, his wayward sister with no other place to go, arrives and requests a place to stay. Brandon reluctantly agrees which appeared to be one of a few attempts to change his habits; the other being starting a real relationship with a beautiful young coworker. Things seem to be going well, but Sissy's intrusive and erratic behavior, though often not intentional, quickly disrupts the rituals that held his psyche together and he begins to break. Her presence makes him feel constricted and bring back those feelings and memories he seemed dead set to repress with his sexual behavior, causing him to spiral downward with his sexual exploits becoming more extreme as the resurgence of his past and inability to cope with her needs boil to the surface.It is important to understand, because the story relies so heavily on their interactions, that Sissy and Brandon share similar pains, though they go about suppressing them in different ways. Sissy is outgoing and wants everyone to love her; whereas Brandon is reserved and prefers to be on his own. When ""living"" becomes too hard they give in to harmful behavior. For Brandon it is sexual stimulation and for Sissy it is cutting herself, as pointed out by Brandon's coworker after noticing her scarred wrist. It is this conflict in their personalities that creates the most drama. They are not suited for one another, Sissy's intruding in Brandon's sheltered existence and Brandon's refusing to give her the attention and love she needs are the sparks that lead to destruction. It is not long before their clashing reaches an unbearable limit and they are both so terribly damaged, and heartbreakingly so, that when they both hit bottom it is a tragic moment. Especially for Brandon who finds himself under the pain of both the shame he places upon himself and his sister.McQueen plays coy on what exactly about their past has had this effect on them but clearly there is a lot under the surface that has left them scarred. Many have complained about this lack of back story or an outright explanation to Brandon's behavior but McQueen is less interested in a thoroughly develop story, and more concerned with peeking into the lives of these individuals. This is honestly all we need. It is sometimes too hard for people to accept that this is just the way we are. Humans have their demons. Films have already thoroughly gone through the scenarios that could lead to this behavior. All that matters is the now, how technology and New York help him to indulge in his addiction, and how he copes with the present.As Brandon Michael Fassbender gives one of the most haunting and courageous performances in a very long time. His willingness to bear all, in scenes the audience can barely sit through let along imagine being a part of, along with his ability to open himself up physically and emotionally and relay so much pain, in a way that feels so human, was just outstanding.Carey Mulligan also shines here in a roll that is unlike anything she has ever done. She plays Sissy as a woman who clearly has her own demons, and although she might seem more outgoing and capable or connecting with others, she also has a hard time coping with the past and the rejection of lovers and her brother. One of the film's most stunning moments comes when Mulligan, in a close up, sings `New York New York' in a powerful, raw and emotional rendition that really mirrored her whole performance.The result of it all is a dark and unsettling portrait of self-destructive souls, driven by some unknown torment, so lost and damaged, struggling to mask one great shame with another in an attempt to feel something; not pleasure but rather the physical and moral pains of the acts they commit. Alone this is challenging stuff, but with the addition of exquisite long shots, beautiful photography adding a sort of poetic grace all set to a hypnotic score by Harry Escott, it becomes not only an emotional but also visually mesmerizing experience.",5,"""We're not bad people.

Tender and heartfelt yet unrelenting in its brutality, this movie presents something new and real at every turn.Sissy is shallow and flighty, a failing singer who comes to New York to stay with her brother, the cool and controlled business professional.  From the beginning, we know something is awry.  Brandon and Sissy throw themselves at each other and break away screaming, they love and despise each other intensely.  Also, Brandon's addiction to sex is rather hard to hide.  Sissy's arrival plunges him into a downward spiral from which the viewer is not spared.  His endless bouts of sex are as off-putting to Brandon as they are to us; like any addict, he has lost all sense of joy or fulfillment in his vice long ago.  He no longer has any choice.Do Sissy and Brandon have an incestuous past?  What about their parents?  As Sissy says, ""We're not bad people.  We just come from a bad place.""

It's not simply a movie about sex...it's a lot more, and I'm rather surprised by its NC-17 rating, because the movie to my judgement is not gratuitous or excessive or offensive in its sexual content or imagery. The film has a quiet strength grounded by its extraordinary cinematography- visceral, restrained, urban, intimate, skewed, dangerous, and real at all turns. The story centers around Brandon, deftly portrayed by Michael Fassbender. He's in an office 9-5 in New York City; his apartment is sterile and cold. His office is a place of posturing and masculine one-upsmanship; his release is through sex, which in itself becomes a prison and and a compulsion. Yet as we see Michael's compulsion interfere with his life, I was not filled with disgust, revulsion, or pity but struck with how powerfully real and painful and fraught with humanity the portrait of the man became. When Brandon's chanteuse sister Sissy (expertly portrayed by Carey Mulligan) enters the picture (and camps out unwelcome and uninvited to his apartment)it is obvious the two share a complex and troubled past; the specifics are not elaborated upon but can be inferred. When Brandon's home life becomes more complicated, he seeks the company of his coworker Marianne. Brandon's stab at a more ""normal"" relationship reveals the primal fear he has of emotional intimacy when sex with Marianne can't be consummated. Her loving embrace and caresses bring Brandon genuine fear as opposed to his go-to porn, one-night stands,  and visits to prostitutes. Yes, the movie is about sex, but it is so much more. It is about the fear of intimacy that can cause extremes of behavior in all of us. It's about levels of dishonesty within ourselves and others,  power and perceptions therof, and a struggle for control over one of our most primal urges. A surprising ending and a thoughtful and sobering  conclusion reveal that the scars we carry on our body are often visible but more often buried underneath a veneer of normality.",5,Cinematic Powerhouse,1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,2042,"['Shame', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget', 'not', 'simply', 'movie', 'sex', 'lot', 'more', ""'m"", 'rather', 'surprised', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'movie', 'judgement', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'excessive', 'offensive', 'sexual', 'content', 'imagery', 'film', 'quiet', 'strength', 'grounded', 'extraordinary', 'cinematography-', 'visceral', 'restrained', 'urban', 'intimate', 'skewed', 'dangerous', 'real', 'turns', 'story', 'centers', 'Brandon', 'deftly', 'portrayed', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'office', '9-5', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'apartment', 'sterile', 'cold', 'office', 'place', 'posturing', 'masculine', 'one-upsmanship', 'release', 'sex', 'prison', 'compulsion', 'see', 'Michael', 'compulsion', 'interfere', 'life', 'was', 'not', 'filled', 'disgust', 'revulsion', 'pity', 'struck', 'how', 'powerfully', 'real', 'painful', 'fraught', 'humanity', 'portrait', 'man', 'became', 'When', 'Brandon', 'chanteuse', 'sister', 'Sissy', 'expertly', 'portrayed', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'picture', 'out', 'unwelcome', 'uninvited', 'apartment', 'obvious', 'two', 'share', 'complex', 'troubled', 'past', 'specifics', 'are', 'not', 'elaborated', 'can', 'be', 'inferred', 'When', 'Brandon', 'home', 'life', 'more', 'complicated', 'company', 'coworker', 'Marianne', 'Brandon', 'stab', 'more', 'normal', 'relationship', 'primal', 'fear', 'emotional', 'intimacy', 'when', 'sex', 'Marianne', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'consummated', 'loving', 'embrace', 'caresses', 'bring', 'Brandon', 'genuine', 'fear', 'opposed', 'go-to', 'porn', 'one-night', 'stands', 'visits', 'prostitutes', 'Yes', 'movie', 'sex', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'fear', 'intimacy', 'can', 'cause', 'extremes', 'behavior', 'levels', 'dishonesty', 'ourselves', 'others', 'power', 'perceptions', 'therof', 'struggle', 'control', 'one', 'most', 'primal', 'urges', 'surprising', 'ending', 'thoughtful', 'sobering', 'conclusion', 'reveal', 'scars', 'carry', 'body', 'are', 'often', 'visible', 'more', 'often', 'buried', 'veneer', 'normality']",Shame Region 2

Sound familiar?The screenwriters seem to have intended Brandon and Sissy (the sibling leads) to be an out clause in this respect by burdening Brandon with sex addiction and Sissy with co-dependence and then attempting to justify this behavior with an oblique reference to a past sexual trauma: ""We're not bad people,"" says Sissy, ""we just come from a bad place."" And that's that. We never learn who abused them, or the exact nature of the abuse. Nor would this information be necessary were Brandon or Sissy charming or seductive or otherwise compelling. But they are none of these things: Brandon just . . . has sex. Lots of it. And he ignores Sissy. And Sissy clings to Brandon. Less-is-more must have been the idea behind Brandon and Sissy, but it undoes them quite. Less is less, in their case. They are not Iago or Hannibal Lecter, for whom opacity worked.This lack of transparency forces the viewer to make sense of their behavior through amateur guesswork. For example: Brandon, denied entry to a nightclub, is so desperate to get off that he resorts to a gay sex dungeon for this purpose. This makes little sense unless we're meant to suspect him of using promiscuity, which had hitherto involved only women, to cope with latent homosexuality. If we're meant to think that Brandon is so enslaved by his addiction that he would sink so low as a gay bar, then the screenwriters should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. And the brother/sister interactions are so bizarre--Sissy standing comfortably naked in front of an uncomfortable Brandon, Sissy constantly hugging/touching an uncomfortable Brandon, Sissy having sex with an uncomfortable Brandon's slimy boss in Brandon's bed, Sissy climbing into bed with a Brandon who is so uncomfortable that he screams at her to get out--that I had to wonder if the trauma from their past was a touch taboo.But all this speculation is only necessary because the film and its controversial sexual content is so very boring. At one point, Sissy and Brandon's slimy boss, a married man with children who makes it his business to hit on every woman he and Brandon encounter in a bar or restaurant, have this exchange:Him: [Holding Sissy's hand. The sleeve of her dress rolls back to reveal her wrist, which is apparently scarred.] What happened to your arm?Her: Oh, when I was a kid I was bored.Him: Well, you must've been really bored.Her: I was.which sums up my attitude to this film.",1,Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame,1358467200,"01 18, 2013",2013,3201,"['[', 'BEWARE', 'OF', 'SPOILERS', ']', 'Imagine', 'film', 'less', 'energetic', 'yet', 'similarly', 'pointless', 'variation', 'American', 'Psycho', 'film', 'Shame', 'skin-deep', 'what-you-see-is-what-you-get', 'script', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'disappointing', 'had', 'characters', 'especially', 'two', 'vaguely-traumatized', 'main', 'characters', 'been', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'Sadly', 'live', 'world', 'upper-income', 'banality', 'dominated', 'glass', 'de-saturated', 'colors', 'world', 'where', 'character', 'despicable', 'only', 'way', 'economically', 'un-imperiled', 'seemingly', 'endlessly', 'privileged', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'despicable', 'most', 'boring', 'way', 'possible', 'are', 'not', 'witty', 'are', 'not', 'exuberant', 'are', 'just', 'dull', 'more', 'less', 'dissatisfied', 'moneyed', 'existence', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'screenwriters', 'seem', 'have', 'intended', 'Brandon', 'Sissy', 'sibling', 'be', 'out', 'clause', 'respect', 'burdening', 'Brandon', 'sex', 'addiction', 'Sissy', 'co-dependence', 'then', 'attempting', 'justify', 'behavior', 'oblique', 'reference', 'past', 'sexual', 'trauma', ""'re"", 'not', 'bad', 'people', 'Sissy', 'just', 'come', 'bad', 'place', 'never', 'learn', 'who', 'abused', 'exact', 'nature', 'abuse', 'would', 'information', 'be', 'necessary', 'were', 'Brandon', 'Sissy', 'charming', 'seductive', 'otherwise', 'compelling', 'are', 'none', 'things', 'Brandon', 'just', 'sex', 'Lots', 'Sissy', 'Sissy', 'clings', 'Brandon', 'Less-is-more', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'idea', 'Brandon', 'Sissy', 'quite', 'Less', 'less', 'case', 'are', 'not', 'Iago', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'whom', 'opacity', 'worked.This', 'lack', 'transparency', 'forces', 'viewer', 'make', 'sense', 'behavior', 'amateur', 'guesswork', 'example', 'Brandon', 'denied', 'entry', 'nightclub', 'so', 'desperate', 'get', 'off', 'gay', 'sex', 'dungeon', 'purpose', 'little', 'sense', ""'re"", 'meant', 'suspect', 'using', 'promiscuity', 'had', 'hitherto', 'involved', 'only', 'women', 'cope', 'latent', 'homosexuality', ""'re"", 'meant', 'think', 'Brandon', 'so', 'enslaved', 'addiction', 'would', 'sink', 'so', 'low', 'gay', 'bar', 'then', 'screenwriters', 'should', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'ashamed', 'brother/sister', 'interactions', 'are', 'so', 'bizarre', 'Sissy', 'standing', 'comfortably', 'naked', 'front', 'uncomfortable', 'Brandon', 'Sissy', 'constantly', 'hugging/touching', 'uncomfortable', 'Brandon', 'Sissy', 'having', 'sex', 'uncomfortable', 'Brandon', 'slimy', 'boss', 'Brandon', 'bed', 'Sissy', 'climbing', 'bed', 'Brandon', 'who', 'so', 'uncomfortable', 'get', 'out', 'had', 'wonder', 'trauma', 'past', 'was', 'touch', 'taboo.But', 'speculation', 'only', 'necessary', 'film', 'controversial', 'sexual', 'content', 'so', 'very', 'boring', 'one', 'point', 'Sissy', 'Brandon', 'slimy', 'boss', 'married', 'man', 'children', 'who', 'business', 'hit', 'woman', 'Brandon', 'encounter', 'bar', 'restaurant', 'have', 'exchange', 'Him', '[', 'Holding', 'Sissy', 'hand', 'sleeve', 'dress', 'rolls', 'back', 'reveal', 'wrist', 'apparently', 'scarred', ']', 'What', 'happened', 'arm', 'Oh', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'was', 'bored.Him', 'Well', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'really', 'bored.Her', 'was.which', 'sums', 'up', 'attitude', 'film']",Shame Region 2

1510411,A328S9RN3U5M68,B006512BFU,Grady Harp,"[28, 31]","SHAME  is a brilliant, courageous, visually and emotionally stunning film by a new team of collaborators - director/writer Steve McQueen, cinematographer Sean Babbitt, and actor Michael Fassbender first gave us the unforgettable HUNGER and now they have teamed to present yet another unique work that will likely go down as one of the finest films of the decade.  Abi Morgan (The Hours television series, The Iron Lady, Tsunami, Sex Traffic) co wrote the screenplay with McQueen; they seem to have an affinity for each other.  This film has been controversial from the first mention that it was being made and controversy usually means that people are reacting strongly (both positively and negatively) to an art work - the true indication that this is by definition Art.The extraordinarily complex story of 21st century isolation and inability to connect with other people except on a unidirectional level of sexual contact is distilled in the role of Brandon (Michael Fassbender, in a multifaceted yet intensely focused performance): Brandon's life is dominated by near anonymous sexual encounters, internet pornography, and multiple daily escapes into onanism, He is quiet, handsome, and utterly irresistible to women and he takes advantage of this preoccupation with sexuality as a loner, living in an apartment, free of relationships, holding down a fine job as an account manager.  This changes when his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) `moves in' and her unwanted presence alters Brandon's modus operandi. Brandon's boss, the married with children Dave (James Badge Dale) envies Brandon's way with women, always losing in his unpracticed approaches to pickups to Brandon's superior techniques.  Dave meets Sissy at a nightclub where Sissy is singing (Mulligan's rendition of Kander and Ebb's `New York, New York' was apparently shot in one take at 3 AM while cameras focuses on the three actors - genuine responses to t a deeply moving moment) and ends up sleeping with Sissy. Brandon, frustrated with Sissy's presence and behavior ultimately leads to his throwing her out of his apartment - an act that has an impactful result. Meanwhile Brandon attempts to `relate' both emotionally and physically with fellow office worker Marianne (Nicole Beharie) with embarrassing results. And in his frustration he walks the night streets having sexual encounters with multiple partners out in the open, in a gay bar, and in thwarted attempts to pickup a girl whose boyfriend beats him severely.Much of the success of this art piece is due to the manner in which McQueen presents his story.  Many of the scenes ore simply faces on the subway and Brandon's fantasies, all accompanied by a musical score by Harry Escott who has elected to use multiple recordings of Glenn Gould playing Bach's Goldberg Variations and Preludes and Fugues - the sublime simplicity of Bach's statements in marked contrast to the chaos in Brandon's mind and actions. In a splendid scene as Brandon awaits a subway, when his mind is tortured and out of control cinematographer Babbitt distorts the image like an acid trip.  But most impressive is the choice to concentrate on Brandon's face as he eyes tricks or faces the world in which he lives in his out of control state  - a face so misguided and needy and yet sensuous that it makes the film draw us inside a character's psyche like few other films have been able.Michael Fassbender does the impossible; he creates a role that despite the behavioral abnormalities remains a man about whom we care about deeply. At film's beginning there is subtle male frontal nudity and Fassbender's remarks about that are mature and enlightening: `To be honest with you again, I think it's the idea of male frontal nudity. It just baffles me: Women can parade around naked all the time, but the guy conveniently has his pants on. I remember my mom always complaining about that to me, saying, ""This is such `b-s', it's always the women who are naked"" ... so I did this one for you, Mom!  Everyone involved in this film is to be commended for the highest level of artistic achievement.  And that extends to the credits at film's end: each participant's name is flashed on the screen with a single musical chord on the piano. The effect is respectful and in keeping with the brilliance of the movie.  Grady Harp, April 10",5,'We're not bad people. We just come from a bad place.

I also like Carey Mulligan but this wasn't one of her best films.  Fassbender plays Brandon, a sex addict.  I think his addiction was portrayed as powerfully as it could have been, which was effective - sex scenes that do nothing but scream how empty he is inside, how badly he lacks the ability to emotionally connect.  Director Steve McQueen does a great job of conveying the characters' emotions and thoughts often without anyone saying a word.  I like that.Now the negatives.  The very slow pace is effective in the beginning, but wore on my patience as the movie progressed.  Too slow for too long.  And by the end of the movie I just wanted to take a shower and watch a really funny comedy.  The movie left me feeling dirty, empty, and depressed.  Sometimes movies do that, and I can handle it, but in this case it ended up being for no reason whatsoever.  In the end the characters are as bad or worse than they were in the beginning.

Sorry...) since seeing Michael Fassbender in Inglourious Basterds.  In Shame, he plays Brandon, a sex addict - prostitutes, women (and one man) he picks up in bars, online sex, masturbation at work - it doesn't matter.  And it's clear that Brandon gets no relief or enjoyment from the sexual acts.  We don't know what drives him to these behaviors, but when his sister, Sissy, (played by Carey Mulligan) shows up uninvited and unwelcome, the tension between the two, Sissy's lack of boundaries with her brother, and Brandon's hostile reactions to her hint at something possibly very traumatic in their pasts.  Sissy continually reaches out to her brother, as he becomes increasingly angry with her neediness and dependency.  An argument with Sissy sends him off to find relief one evening in the one way he knows how: with a series of degrading and potentially dangerous sexual acts.  The night culminates in a threesome.  While some might think any threesome must be good, this one would change your mind.  The scene depicted here was not sexy at all and Brandon's pain (Fassbender WENT for it here) was heart-breaking to watch.Fassbender received some international awards for this role, as well as a Golden Globe nomination.  His performance is extraordinary, as is Mulligan's.  He makes you feel the hopelessness and emptiness of Brandon.  I can't say I liked him, but I did feel sympathy for him.  And let's not forget George Clooney's salute to Fassbender's golf club-size...appendage.If you like Michael in Shame, I'd like to recommend two earlier movies of his:Fish Tank (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray] andEden Lake.

1510416,A3FW5ALCFOJ9IU,B006512BFU,irishalto,"[2, 2]","This movie portrays life in New York City as an enormously empty place, empty in terms of meaning and personal connections.  The protagonist played wonderfully by Michael Fassbender, walks around almost like a wolf looking to find a mating partner for the moment.  He stares women down on the train.  When he does try to make intimate contact with a coworker, he ends up being sadly impotent.  This was hard to see, but gave me insight into his need to troll endlessly looking for human connection.  His sister is a fair to middling singer with deep wounds that are transparent and manifested by self destructive and suicidal behavior.  The missing link I see in the movie, and I could be wrong, is that the siblings had at one point in their life, an incestuous relationship, that she wants to continue but he does not.  Instead he seeks to clean himself with annonymous sexual liaisons. I think that the brother being offended by his sister's sexual encounter with his boss helps to strengthen this hypothesis.  He cringes like a child listening to their connective noises, and has to go out to jog while they finish.  The glare of graphic sexual encounters is necessary in a way to contrast to their otherwise meaningless lives, and I did not find it to be offensive. Neither party is willing or able to confront their demons.Overall I found this movie to be provocative and is on my mind days after seeing it.  I think it is worthwhile to watch.

The writers struggle with where to locate scenes - an endless series of 'talking heads' pieces are set in restaurants, bars, offices and literally any of the locations are interchangeable because this is a dialog driven movie. And there's really not much dialog.Rarely the fan of 5-minute camera shots with zero editing and long stares that rely on the audience to work out the narrative, I find it hard to recommend a story that truly has no plot. The hero is an sex-addicted sketch of a character who can mysteriously stare any woman into bed. His sister sings dreadful depressing songs in bars that would drive any sober clients away and anyone intoxicated towards jumping off the nearest high building. There a strong hint of incest in their past but nothing in their history is ever shown so you have to conclude:- The sister started an incestuous relationship that pushed the brother into a life of meaningless one-night stands.- The brother started an incestuous relationship that destroyed the sister's subsequent romantic relationships and the brother is so ashamed he can no longer have meaningful relationships.- The sister wants to start a relationship with her brother.- None of the above and these two people just need some therapy.The whole setup had the capacity to deliver an interesting story but its a damp squib and instead I have to watch Michael Fassbender walking around naked and going to the bathroom. In terms of the editing, or lack of, there are countless scenes that just go on forever with no sense of pacing whatsoever, including:- A 5-minute performance by Carey Mulligan of ""New York, New York"".- A multi-minute jogging sequence through the city, which is also incredibly poorly lit.- A torturous single-cut restaurant scene that could have come straight out of a first year film school project. (Remember the screenplay rule of avoiding scenes in restaurants?)The other weird thing is that the accents are all over the place. Anyway, there is something to the idea of the movie but it's not in final draft format and would have been more suited to a play. In terms of a review, there's not a single person in my circle of friends or family who would enjoy this, and the only reason my wife didn't stop half way through was because I'd hidden the remote.",2,This is a play masquerading as a film,1336262400,"05 6, 2012",2012,2516,"['exception', 'copious', 'amounts', 'nudity', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'visual', 'film', 'given', 'most', 'drama', 'internalized', 'characters', 'material', 'play', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'writers', 'struggle', 'where', 'locate', 'scenes', 'endless', 'series', ""'talking"", 'heads', 'pieces', 'are', 'set', 'restaurants', 'bars', 'offices', 'literally', 'locations', 'are', 'interchangeable', 'dialog', 'driven', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'dialog.Rarely', 'fan', '5-minute', 'camera', 'shots', 'zero', 'editing', 'long', 'stares', 'rely', 'audience', 'work', 'out', 'narrative', 'find', 'hard', 'recommend', 'story', 'truly', 'plot', 'hero', 'sex-addicted', 'sketch', 'character', 'who', 'can', 'mysteriously', 'stare', 'woman', 'bed', 'sister', 'sings', 'dreadful', 'depressing', 'songs', 'bars', 'would', 'drive', 'sober', 'clients', 'away', 'anyone', 'intoxicated', 'towards', 'jumping', 'off', 'nearest', 'high', 'building', 'strong', 'hint', 'incest', 'past', 'nothing', 'history', 'ever', 'shown', 'so', 'have', 'conclude', 'sister', 'started', 'incestuous', 'relationship', 'pushed', 'brother', 'life', 'meaningless', 'one-night', 'stands.-', 'brother', 'started', 'incestuous', 'relationship', 'destroyed', 'sister', 'subsequent', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'brother', 'so', 'ashamed', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'meaningful', 'relationships.-', 'sister', 'start', 'relationship', 'brother.-', 'None', 'above', 'two', 'people', 'just', 'need', 'therapy.The', 'whole', 'setup', 'had', 'capacity', 'deliver', 'interesting', 'story', 'damp', 'squib', 'instead', 'have', 'watch', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'walking', 'around', 'naked', 'going', 'bathroom', 'terms', 'editing', 'lack', 'are', 'countless', 'scenes', 'just', 'go', 'forever', 'sense', 'pacing', 'whatsoever', 'including', '5-minute', 'performance', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', '.-', 'multi-minute', 'jogging', 'sequence', 'city', 'also', 'incredibly', 'poorly', 'lit.-', 'torturous', 'single-cut', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'straight', 'first', 'year', 'film', 'school', 'project', 'Remember', 'screenplay', 'rule', 'avoiding', 'scenes', 'restaurants', 'other', 'weird', 'thing', 'accents', 'are', 'place', 'Anyway', 'something', 'idea', 'movie', 'not', 'final', 'draft', 'format', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'suited', 'play', 'terms', 'review', 'not', 'single', 'person', 'circle', 'friends', 'family', 'who', 'would', 'enjoy', 'only', 'reason', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'half', 'way', 'was', ""'d"", 'hidden', 'remote']",Shame Region 2

1510421,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B006512BFU,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[10, 10]","To all of the actors we've been introduced to over the past few years, two that have made a significant impression have been Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan. After seeing Fassbender in more commercial films like 300 and INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, he made quite an impression, and after seeing Mulligan in AN EDUCATION, I was totally taken with her talent and charm. Then I saw and was absolutely stunned by Fassbender's performance in HUNGER (directed by this film's director Steve McQueen), based on a true story of an Irish political prisoner who goes on a hunger strike. It was an amazing performance and probably one of the most affecting performances of recent years. Also continuing to shine was Mulligan in films like the haunting and underrated NEVER LET ME GO and my personal pick of best film of 2011, DRIVE.But SHAME is a showcase for both of these great actors in incredibly bare (both figuratively and literally) and incredibly powerful performances.Fassbender plays Brandon, a young professional in New York City. He is also a sex addict, and while some people play around with the idea of defining Brandon as such, it is absolute. He cannot function throughout the day without different sexual acts, liasons, and exposure to sexual input, and the level of danger that it can represent is of little consequence to him; It's the same as being a drug addict or an alcoholic. Then comes along Sissy (Mulligan), Brandon's less responsible and emotionally unstable sister as she invades his apartment and his life. She is an addict of a different sort; she craves love and attention and affection, and Brandon, being who he is, seems incapable of giving something of what she wants to her.Fassbender plays Brandon as something of a predator; riding the subway, he scans the different people and finds a beautiful woman who smiles at him, but he never smiles back. He looks as her as if she's a meal or a fix; something to sate his neverending appetite, and when she gets off the train, he pursues her in a very unsettling way. He is also emotionally empty inside and realizes it. He's not a sociopath; he just uses sex to express all of his feelings and to fill the emptiness inside him. The closer he gets to someone emotionally, the more sexual encounters he requires, and this builds to a crescendo of self-punishment and more extreme sexual acts when he and Sissy have a massive fight about their meaning to one another. Mulligan plays Sissy as someone who is desperate for attention and affection, but in a more playful manner than Brandon's predatory persona. She may initially appear as quirky and free-spirited, but is as equally self-destructive, seeking affection in places she knows she can't get them.McQueen, who also directed the marvelous and extremely unsettling HUNGER directs this film with the same level of attention to detail and with the same verve of the construction of a scene. He also knows how to direct a scene that is so incredibly tense yet be somewhat innocent at the same time and this is best displayed with two scenes: the scene where Brandon discovers Sissy in his apartment in his shower fully nude and his eyes linger perhaps a little too long at her and yet she allows it rather than covering up with the towel immediately, suggesting there may have been something in their past that has been more than familial; also the scene in which Sissy sings a very torch-song rendition of ""New York, New York"", and the camera is close in on her face for most of the song, but cuts back to Fassbender, in obvious distress.This film arguably doesn't require the NC-17 rating aside from the casual male nudity and a few very brief moments of graphic imagery, especially since other NC-17 or Unrated releases within recent memory have featured full, unsimulated sex, like many of the films of Catherine Brelliat, John Cameron Mitchell's brilliant SHORTBUS, or Michael Winterbottom's 9 SONGS, but this film actually wears that rating like a badge of honor. The sex and nudity within this film is certainly not meant to tittilate or excite or even to shock. It is there because it's a vital part of the story of this character. It's there because in order for us to understand, we have to experience on something of a similar and visceral level, and this film could honestly not exist without it. The sex and nudity of the film is not nearly as controversial as the actual subject matter is, and it doubtless will offend people, but the people it would offend really shouldn't be watching this film anyway.Both Fassbender (who is arguably the hardest working actor in film over the last two years, and he's been the highlight of just about all of the films he's been in) and Mulligan give extraordinary performances, but it's without a doubt Fassbender's film. And it's a testament to the performers' courage to be actors known for their magnetism (no pun intended for Fassbender) and charisma to allow them to be shown at their least charismatic.SHAME is a challenging, intelligent, and at times a terrifying film, and it's absolutely not a piece of art that anyone involved should be ashamed of.",5,"Fassbender and Mulligan do powerful, desperate, and

1510426,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B006512BFU,John's Horror Corner,"[1, 1]","For those who like the gritty, satisfying-for-not-being-satisfying films, this is for you.  No story, little development, but I was heavily affected.If our favorite self-loathing, vain American Psycho and his self-abusive little sister had all of the sexual hang-ups of Rodger Dodger (2002) then we'd have Michael Fassbender (X-Men: First Class, Haywire) and Carey Mulligan (Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, Drive) from Shame.Brandon (Fassbender) is a NYC exec with an ostentatiously modern, white, sterile condo and a serious sex addiction.  He ever so casually saunters high society lounges and effortless finds company for the evening.  But that doesn't seem to be enough to quench his deep-seeded thirst for--something.  On a daily basis his only smiles are elicited by flirtations or discussions thereof with his partner in crime, his boss.Brandon apathetically ignores his sister's routine calls until one day he comes home to find that she, Sissy (Mulligan), has dropped in unannounced.  This turns into an uncomfortable, family-valueless argument during which Sissy is naked.  She makes no effort to cover up nor does Brandon try to avert his eyes.  They bicker like participants in an unhealthy marriage, which sets the stage for their even more unhealthy relationship as brother and sister.  At this point we can imagine that they've been through something serious together and that they, at some point, strongly depended on one another.  We can also imagine that moral lines may have been crossed.Working a few gigs as a lounge singer, Sissy draws the attention of Brandon's business cohort.  Their affections clearly displease Brandon.  In fact, it incites frustration, resentment, enmity and rage.  Masturbation, full frontal nudity, intense sexual tension and a brilliantly tactful score make this film all about a tone of depravity.  You never quite feel comfortable watching this film, yet you need to know where it's going and why Brandon and Sissy are the way that they are.  Keeping in tune with American Psycho, Brandon has an addiction to pornography and an often cold demeanor that accompany him even in the workplace.On another note, I can't help but to wonder if the man cast as Brandon's waiter (during a date scene) wasn't cast because he looked like a very American Psycho Christian Bale.  The waiter has a surprising among of dialogue, all somewhat humorous, and all interrupting a scene designed to demonstrate that Brandon is romantically challenged and generally disconnected.As Brandon becomes ever more removed from emotionally connecting with anyone else, his sister included, the sexuality becomes rather intense, more frequent and, for some, perhaps difficult to watch.  This film probably won't make you laugh or cry, nor will it lead you to anything resembling catharsis.  It will, however, impress you with the cast's ability to take on this intense--I dare not call it a story--series of scenes.

1510428,A3UCF82XIPJME2,B006512BFU,"Jones ""itimbuktu""","[1, 1]","I am on the fence about this film. On one hand, the storyline is very strange and some of the sex scenes are very graphic. On the other hand, the story makes sense if you understand that Michael Fassbender obviously comes from a crazy and totally dysfunctional family and really has no one that he can confide in. Even his sister, played by Carey Mulligan, is nuts and it's alluded to that the two of them may not have had a normal brother-sister relationship. In fact, it's pretty clear to me that the two of them  had an incestuous relationship when they were younger but that is not stated in the film. And when Fassbender tries to venture out of his comfort zone to establish a normal boyfriend-girlfriend relationship with one of his coworkers, he finds that he cannot perform in the bedroom and, feeling helpless and demoralized, resorts to his past behavior of one-night stands, drugs, and unprotected and wild sex.As an actor, Fassbender does an exceptional job with the main character. His personality is withdrawn, introverted, and in a constant state of inner pain. It's very difficult for him to show true emotion but when he does the transition is amazing. I just wish the movie had provided more background information as to what happened to Fassbender's character when we was younger to make him engage in such destructive behavior because that might have enabled me to appreciate the story more. As it was, I understood why Fassbender did what he did, but it was still very awkward to see it play out on film. It was if I were watching the inner workings of someone's very messed up private life when they really didn't want anyone to know what was going on. But maybe that was the intention of the director.Overall, I'm not sure I would recommend this movie for the story itself but Michael Fassbender's acting is wonderful.",3,Weird movie but great performance by Fassbender,1395532800,"03 23, 2014",2014,1841,"['am', 'fence', 'film', 'one', 'hand', 'storyline', 'very', 'strange', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'graphic', 'other', 'hand', 'story', 'sense', 'understand', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'obviously', 'crazy', 'totally', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'really', 'one', 'can', 'confide', 'Even', 'sister', 'played', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'nuts', 'alluded', 'two', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'normal', 'brother-sister', 'relationship', 'fact', 'pretty', 'clear', 'two', 'had', 'incestuous', 'relationship', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'not', 'stated', 'film', 'when', 'Fassbender', 'venture', 'comfort', 'zone', 'establish', 'normal', 'boyfriend-girlfriend', 'relationship', 'one', 'coworkers', 'can', 'not', 'perform', 'bedroom', 'feeling', 'helpless', 'demoralized', 'past', 'behavior', 'one-night', 'stands', 'drugs', 'unprotected', 'wild', 'sex.As', 'actor', 'Fassbender', 'exceptional', 'job', 'main', 'character', 'personality', 'withdrawn', 'introverted', 'constant', 'state', 'inner', 'pain', 'very', 'difficult', 'show', 'true', 'emotion', 'when', 'transition', 'amazing', 'just', 'wish', 'movie', 'had', 'provided', 'more', 'background', 'information', 'what', 'happened', 'Fassbender', 'character', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'make', 'engage', 'such', 'destructive', 'behavior', 'might', 'have', 'enabled', 'appreciate', 'story', 'more', 'was', 'understood', 'why', 'Fassbender', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'awkward', 'see', 'play', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'were', 'watching', 'inner', 'workings', 'someone', 'very', 'messed', 'up', 'private', 'life', 'when', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'maybe', 'was', 'intention', 'director.Overall', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'story', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'acting', 'wonderful']",Shame Region 2

1510430,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B006512BFU,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[12, 17]","Shame is a brave, uninhibited film about a man crippled by his addiction to sex. This could have been the premise for a comedy, but British director Steve McQueen and his co-writer Abi Morgan have made it a startlingly powerful drama that tackles the subject head-on and with utter seriousness. This is McQueen's second film after his highly acclaimed, 2008 debut Hunger and he has once again cast Michael Fassbender in the lead role. Things have changed since 2008 and Fassbender's name carries more clout than it did previously. If Fassbender had made this film as an unknown actor, this would have garnered him some attention.Sex addiction is a tricky subject to make a serious-minded film about. Most men cannot fathom how this type of addiction could be debilitating and may actually envy Fassbender's plight. Secondly, when you explore the depths of sex addiction in the frank, unflinching way this film does, you're risking mismanagement of the material. Showing a character's rendezvous with a trove of women is not too difficult, but showing these actions as driven by compulsion and anguish is. When you have to show a character so consumed with sex that he must constantly watch porn, masturbate, or go to whatever lengths necessary to achieve orgasm, you're running the risk of an audience giggling through the entire film. Furthermore, when your film has as much full-frontal nudity and simulated sex as this one, you run the risk of the audience finding it arousing which effectively destroys the impact of what's being shown.Somehow, without the term ""sex addiction"" ever being mentioned out loud, this film manages to plunge the abyss of sex addiction with a strong sense of sincerity and show a character imprisoned by it. Nothing about the addiction portrayed is laughable and the many scenes of nudity and sex are far from erotic. People love to call porn ""art,"" but most people will admit (in secret) that most scenes of a sexual nature referred to as ""art"" and ""non-erotic"" are far from artistic and very erotic. None of these scenes in Shame are erotic and McQueen's profession as an artist is remarkably apparent in the way he has shot this film and put it together.There was a difficult, but clear-eyed view of how this film was supposed to be and nothing ever comes across as insincere or overwrought. It's a very elegant-looking film with a couple of mainstream actors turning in powerhouse performances. The film has netted attention for its NC-17 rating and the refusal to appeal it. In a rare decision, the studio and filmmakers chose to embrace the rating rather than view it as a stigma. This was a smart decision, as nothing in Shame could have been toned down without sacrificing what makes it so effective in the first place.Fassbender plays Brandon, a handsome, 30-something man living in New York City. He has a generic, suit-and-tie job and is well-off financially, but the specifics are unimportant. His private life is carefully cultivated to help guard his sexual compulsions which involve online porn, frequent masturbating, prostitutes, and picking up women for random physical encounters. Order in his life is important to him, as he's ashamed of the addiction that drives him. This carefully constructed lifestyle is crashed by the unexpected arrival of Sissy (Carey Mulligan), his little sister.It's here that the movie could misstep by allowing this contrivance to push the film into Hollywood soap-opera territory. McQueen's command over the material instead provides open-ended implications into childhood trauma that may have lead to Brandon's uncontrollable lifestyle. There is the implication that both suffered something in their childhood that had a profound effect on the people they've become, but the film offers no easy answers. There is no heavy implication of any particular tragedy or abuse, no mention of mistreatment by a mother or father; the most revealing line of dialogue is Sissy telling Brandon ""we're not bad people, we just come from a bad place."" It's these concise flourishes of brilliance that fuel the development of these characters and their traits. The film allows us to fill in many of the blanks for ourselves, providing enough to elicit thought-provoking interpretations. The ambiguity doesn't make it unapproachable or inaccessible, just all the more fascinating and compelling.Shame is composed of long, unbroken shots and mostly superfluous dialogue. Here is a film brave enough to hold a close-up of Carey Mulligan for roughly five minutes, with only one or two brief cutaways, as she sings `New York, New York.' This scene is remarkably powerful. Nothing in the rather minimal dialogue is particularly revealing about the psyche of the characters and McQueen brings us into Brandon's suffering using the artistic finesse that he brings to directing and through the acting prowess of Michael Fassbender.The opening sequence illustrating Brandon's daily routine sets the mood appropriately, with a sweeping score by Harry Escott (that does appear to have been borrowed significantly from Hans Zimmer) that brilliantly complements what's onscreen. One of these early scenes shows Brandon's attention drifting to a woman on the subway, while sounds of sexual pleasure interrupt the soundtrack. They proceed to flirt with each other for a couple minutes without ever saying a word.It's become a clich&eacute; to call an actor `brave' whenever they do something decidedly un-mainstream, like graphic nudity. It's appropriate for what Fassbender does here. He has several scenes of full-frontal nudity, but it's not just his flesh that's exposed. This is a brave, dedicated performance that shows him baring not only his skin, but his soul. A fearless actor, he builds a fully realized character and brings the audience into the anguish and suffering that Brandon feels without spoon-feeding his emotional state to the audience. He captures the isolation, the inability to form emotional connections. When Brandon reaches the peak of his desperation, Fassbender reminds us of what great acting truly is. There's not a note in his performance that seems false or forced, and the intense, personal emotion he portrays transcends mere acting. There are a lot of sex scenes and Fassbender convincingly emulates a man driven by necessity and compulsion rather than pleasure. These desires, these emotions, and that hollow emptiness he so perfectly captures could not have been easy to tap into. This is the best performance of 2011, by far.Carey Mulligan is one of the most talented young actresses working today, but her previous roles reveal why McQueen was initially hesitant to cast her. Her role as Sissy is such a departure from her performances An Education, Never Let Me Go, and Drive, performances that are all, in one way or another, cut from the same cloth. Unlike Brandon, whose physical appearance betrays his internal trauma, Sissy wears her wounds inside and out. It's surprising to see this elegant, quiet actress play such a brash, trashy character with no respect for the boundaries that Brandon has to maintain his existence. The scenes they share pulse with tension, the lingering effects of a traumatizing past, and repressed emotion that give the film a jolt of raw realism.At 99 minutes, Shame seems to run much longer. I did not find it tedious; in fact, I was so glued to my seat that I didn't move until the credits. It's just such an unflinching character stud that goes to some dark places to explore its main character. It gets under your skin, clutches your emotions, and leaves you feeling shell-shocked. Shame is a thought-provoking, poetic, and unforgettable film that tackles a rarely-discussed subject with great courage and vision. It's a movie you experience rather than passively view, alternatively graceful and gritty. I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Beautifully directed, Shame contains two of the year's most powerful performances and is easily the most powerful film of the year. An adult drama that doesn't sacrifice artistic integrity in favor of commercial viability or accessibility, few films succeed at so effectively shaking up their audience. This is an uncompromising piece of filmmaking that travels into the depths of despair and depravity. When the credits roll, you'll feel like you've been assaulted.GRADE: A",5,An Uncompromising Piece of Filmmaking,1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,8341,"['Shame', 'brave', 'uninhibited', 'film', 'man',

At the same time, the craving for healing, to unite, to put the shattered pieces together, pieces from the past, to make sense of the present, all those are shown poetically in this movie. It's not a linear movie with a linear message and the kind that are open for linear interpretation.

1510433,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B006512BFU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[151, 155]","While most mainstream critics have praised the daring work of leads Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan, the reception to co-writer/director Steve McQueen's ""Shame"" has been somewhat mixed.  It's really no surprise as this gritty and unpleasant film seems designed to polarize its audience.  A lot of attention has been focused on the film's nudity and sexual content, and I'm pleased to see that the dreaded NC-17 rating hasn't discouraged year-end accolades from being awarded to its stars.  While I'm not sure that ""Shame"" is as fraught with meaning as some of its more ardent supporters would have you believe, I do think that it is a dizzyingly unique film.  As a character study, and a fascinating one at that, the screenplay actually tells you very little about the central pair of disturbed siblings.  And yet, as the film progressed, my mind filled in all the blanks.  You are invited to watch their most intimate and destructive behavior while only given clues as to the psychological origins that set them on these paths.  The fact that the movie doesn't spell things out is perhaps my favorite thing about it and what sets it apart.Fassbender plays a successful New York professional that wallows in random sexual encounters.  While he is never labeled an addict, per se, his behavior is certainly compulsive and seems to invade and control every aspect of his day.  He seems to relish the life, except in moments of introspection, but his ability to connect with people on a meaningless physical level has superceded any real emotional relationships.  When his troubled sister (Mulligan) stays with him, it seems to stir up a lot of conflicting feelings.  The two do a strange and compelling dance of dysfunction.  She is needy and possibly dangerous to herself, and Fassbender seems incapable or simply unwilling to let her get close.  As I said, the film doesn't explore their history in any tangible way, but it's not hard for the viewer to start making connections and interpretations about how they got to this point.  Perhaps not everyone will read the film in exactly the same way, but that's part of its power.Is hope and/or reformation possible?  Or is it simply too late?  Despite all of the hooking up, ""Shame"" is filled with loneliness and despair.  While their acts bring them into contact with others, they also alienate them in irreparable ways.  The film comes to an emotional, and not particularly surprising, conclusion.  But whether or not anything has actually changed is, once again, left open to interpretation.  If you need a grand plot or a big story arc, this isn't a film for you.  This is just an intensely close look at characters adrift without purpose.  Michael Fassbender is proving to be one of the most reliable and versatile actors of his generation, and 2011 has been a great year for him with a string of diverse projects.  Alternately charming and chilling, this is a terrific piece that relies more on what he doesn't say than on what he does.  And Mulligan is also a study of conflicts and vulnerability.  ""Shame"" is easily worth it for these performances, but this bleak movie is certainly not for everyone.

It's one of those movies where you have to ask yourself ""what the hell did I just watch?"" This movie was absolutely awful. It was slow and boring, and quite frankly, creepy at times. There was really something freakish and almost incestuous about Brandon (Michael Fassbender) and his sister's relationship. At least that's the way it seemed to me. There were times when he behaved rather possessive and jealous like a lover instead of a brother. I mean...not only was he too concerned, for my taste, about who she was sleeping with, but I also found it disturbing that her brother stood there gawking at her while she's naked in the shower. They chose to have an entire conversation with her naked, and facing him. Also, they show her climbing into bed with her brother while he was naked, and him eventually straddling her. These are just a few examples of the ways I never hope to know my brother.It painfully clear they have some resentment towards each other as well as deep-rooted family issues, but they never tell you what those issues are for real.To close the show, Brandon goes off on an all-night sex bender where anything goes. Nothing and no one is off limits, prostitutes, masturbation, and even other men. I felt like I was watching an ad for safe sex, or should I say what not to do because his behavior was absolutely reckless and nasty. To think, they show you a seemingly heterosexual man the entire movie only to have him sink so low as to start grabbing up guys in gay bars. That came out of nowhere.

1510442,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B006512BFU,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 2]","""Shame"" is an amazing film.  It is raw, gritty and sexual.  But it has a point.  What I saw in this film was a guy, Brandon played by Michael Fassbender, who has the biologic urges that most men have.  There is some hint of a dysfunctional past that we never fully understand, except through glimpses with his sister played by Carey Mulligan.  However, as much as Brandon needs sexual adventure, he almost totally lacks a capacity for intimacy.  Some have called the look of the film austere and cold from Brandon's icy urban apartment to his work cubicle to the subway trains he rides.  This mirrors his internal state and emphasizes the lack of human warmth.Sex, when it comes from love, produces some of the most valuable and important of human experiences -- feelings of acceptance, joy, security, tenderness, passion and beauty.  When sex comes from a self-centered place of lust, it can be one of the most damaging of human emotions.The date that Brandon has with coworker Marianne, played by Nicole Beharie, contrasts Marianne's search for love and Brandon's need to satisfy desire.  As a result, Brandon hires prostitutes that he can use and be done with, scans computer sex sites, prowls at clubs, and has his momentary satisfaction, but is left with an internal emptiness that haunts him, played so well by Fassbender.  After a fight with his sister, Brandon fingers a girl at a bar which leads to a beating by her boyfriend which leads Brandon to follow a guy eyeing him into a gay club which leads to shame and his need to atone by having two women at the same time.  This poor guy is so trapped; he spins from sexual episode to episode like a rat in a maze.The film is bookended by Brandon staring at a woman on the subway, played by Lucy Walters.  At the opening of the film, he leers at her, flirting, until she reveals a wedding band which only whets his appetite.  At the end of the film, he again sees the same girl and looks at her coldly, which I read as a lesson learned that casual sex would not bring him ultimate satisfaction.I am impressed by the number of awards this film won:Black Reel Awards: Best Director, Best ScreenplayBritish Independent Film Awards: Best Actor (Michael Fassbender)Evening Standard British Film Awards: Best ActorFlorida Film Critics Award: Best ActorHollywood Film Festival: Supporting Actress of the Year (Carey Mulligan)Irish Film & Television Awards: Best ActorLondon Critics Circle Film Awards: British Actor of the Year (Michael Fassbender)Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards: Best ActorOnline Film Critics Society Awards: Best ActorVancouver Film Critics Circle: Best ActorVenice Film Festival: Best Film, Best ActorFassbender's performance is fearless, edgy and makes us ache for this man who has so much potential, and yet is so screwed up and unhappy.

There is the sound of blinds opening, but no sight of them.The title drew me in, sceptical as I was that a good-looking, well-employed man could yield a realistic exploration of sex addiction, the average sex addict having lesser options. Perhaps Brandon's cushy lifestyle and GQ deportment allow us to see the cost to his soul, since we are not primarily concerned with his losing his job, home, freedom, life. In fact, when his sister calls out his misbehaviour, his defence is that he has a job, an apartment. We are accustomed to typical addict stories where the argument for sobriety is ""See how drugs/drink took from you your job/home/family!"" and never, ""What about your soul?""So this is not an addict story, in that sense. Let's acknowledge that this story would play out differently for someone who doesn't look or live like Brandon, and we would be less likely to watch scene after scene of a character drinking, eating or shooting up as we do of Brandon having sex. It seems a bit like cheating, like the film is banking on sex. It works because we are the shameless ones, willing to watch. The sex scenes are mechanical and, save one, not at all sensual, which is appropriate because compulsion is about moving away from the senses, a reaching for the perceived safety and comfort of senselessness.[This review is Spoiler-ish, explicit and takes itself too seriously from this point on.]When Brandon goes on a sex bender he finally takes on sweaty sheen of an addict. Dressed down, his cool gone, he ends up in an underground sex club. It is the darkest scene in the movie, literally, a far cry from his light-filled apartment. In the most carnal scene-- too prettily shot, too much like a fantasy a man might have, the music, with its reaching then dipping pitch, tensing then relaxing phrases, suggests that Brandon is straining for the sublime as he takes on two women with grim determination. Is this honest? Is sexual indulgence a soul reaching for the sublime or an animal scratching an eternal itch? The camera turns its focus onto Brandon's face and there is a look of such anguish, like a variation of The Scream-- you might even say a portrait of human suffering, and then, the void.Along with the void, the film has some other expert renderings: Brandon's reaction to his sister's sexual conquest; an after-hours bar scene that hits every yuppie note; a first date complete with tentative waiter and inconsequential yet revealing conversation, and, especially, the wordless flirtation Brandon has with a woman on the subway.  Rituals are what the film captures well. Rituals and the void.",5,"""I find you disgusting.

Its more like Voyeurism of a so-called sex addict. The only points made end up being the obvious one that the main character has issues being close to women emotionally. But they mess even that point up by making the main character into the seduction master. He stares at women with his magic eyes and suddenly they decide on a quickie. It would have been more real for him to go after the desperate or the kind of women who are at a bar for last call. Its just silly to say that he can emotionally seduce almost magically while the basis for the character is emotional detachment.What I liked least in the film is when it drags out one of the oldest cliche in the world and blames all of Brandon's problems on child abuse. They don't linger on it, but they make sure the point is clear.The film is good at making sex boring and of communicating the problem of the sex addict in that sense. But it doesn't really make for a compelling film. The boring and empty activities of the film end up being boring for the audience as well.The film adds in a redemption element through a sister. But its all really crude and obvious stuff. And the point reached at the end where he can only solve his own problems by attaching himself to the troubles of another person isn't very deep.The director has given himself the primary writing credit for the film. But as with his previous film (Hunger), the secondary writing credit is given to an experienced writer (in this case Abi Morgan). After having done this twice, it really raises questions about how much of a writer/director he actually is. And why exactly he is giving himself the primary writing credit (not plotting credit or secondary credit for example) in his films.Steve McQueen (the director) is of course more famous now for parties and being famous than he is for his work. He is a ruthless self-promotor of the Andy Warhol variety. He has shown some degree of talent, but after this film I wonder if the talent is more in the people he can gather around himself than his actual skill. This wasn't a great film and minus the talented actors who signed on the project, it would have been a terrible film. It may be that his real talent is more being a producer than a director.",1,boring,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,2331,"['movie', 'supposedly', 'sex', 'addiction', 'really', 'nothing', 'say', 'subject', 'more', 'Voyeurism', 'so-called', 'sex', 'addict', 'only', 'points', 'made', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'obvious', 'one', 'main', 'character', 'issues', 'being', 'close', 'women', 'emotionally', 'mess', 'even', 'point', 'up', 'making', 'main', 'character', 'seduction', 'master', 'women', 'magic', 'eyes', 'suddenly', 'decide', 'quickie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'real', 'go', 'desperate', 'kind', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'bar', 'last', 'call', 'just', 'silly', 'say', 'can', 'emotionally', 'seduce', 'almost', 'magically', 'basis', 'character', 'emotional', 'liked', 'least', 'film', 'when', 'out', 'one', 'oldest', 'cliche', 'world', 'Brandon', 'problems', 'child', 'abuse', 'do', ""n't"", 'linger', 'make', 'sure', 'point', 'clear.The', 'film', 'good', 'making', 'sex', 'boring', 'communicating', 'problem', 'sex', 'addict', 'sense', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'compelling', 'film', 'boring', 'empty', 'activities', 'film', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'boring', 'audience', 'well.The', 'film', 'redemption', 'element', 'sister', 'really', 'crude', 'obvious', 'stuff', 'point', 'reached', 'end', 'where', 'can', 'only', 'solve', 'own', 'problems', 'attaching', 'troubles', 'person', ""n't"", 'very', 'deep.The', 'director', 'given', 'primary', 'writing', 'credit', 'film', 'previous', 'film', 'Hunger', 'secondary', 'writing', 'credit', 'given', 'experienced', 'writer', 'case', 'Abi', 'Morgan', 'having', 'done', 'twice', 'really', 'questions', 'how', 'much', 'writer/director', 'actually', 'why', 'exactly', 'giving', 'primary', 'writing', 'credit', 'not', 'plotting', 'credit', 'secondary', 'credit', 'example', 'films.Steve', 'McQueen', 'director', 'course', 'more', 'famous', 'now', 'parties', 'being', 'famous', 'work', 'ruthless', 'self-promotor', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'variety', 'shown', 'degree', 'talent', 'film', 'wonder', 'talent', 'more', 'people', 'can', 'gather', 'actual', 'skill', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'talented', 'actors', 'who', 'signed', 'project', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'terrible', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'real', 'talent', 'more', 'being', 'producer', 'director']",Shame Region 2
1510453,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B006512BFU,Mark Turner,"[6, 22]","Perhaps I've grown a bit jaded over the years. At 54 years old I've seen all sorts of movies. I've seen everything from low budget movies that were impressive to high budget movies that were terrible and the other way round. I've seen movies that were supposed to be great that I hated and movies that were supposed to be terrible that I loved. I've seen movies that were supposed to be high brow dramas that I agreed with. And then I've seen movies like this one that had all the trappings of high brow intellectual crap that critics love to meander over that in truth were nothing less than boring.Michael Fassbender stars as Brandon, a young executive on the rise. Things seem to be going well for him professionally but personally not much so. Brandon is a character lacking something in his life. For the most part he has little if no love life going for him. At the same time, his sex life is exploding. Brandon is a sex addict of sorts. If he's not paying some high priced call girl for her time, he's surfing sex sites online or having sex conversations there as well. Personally his life is a mess.If this weren't bad enough, Brandon's sister enters his life as well. Sissy is another totally messed up individual. Having been through many men in the hopes of finding the right one, she always seems to pick the losers. After a recent split she asks if she can stay at his place for a while. He relents and she invites him to see her perform at a local club. He finds it hard to believe she's found work but is stunned when she does well.So now you have the set up of the story. And honestly it doesn't go much further than this. Each character's interaction with each other and Brandon's interaction with a woman he is attracted to despite his emotional problems make for the gist of the film. Long conversations that lead no where, revelations that aren't surprising and the lack of a character to feel sorry for, to sympathize with, make this one long boring film.As I said earlier, there are films that critics love to praise with pseudo-intellectual clap trap, discussing the symbolism of what the director intended or how the actors were able to display intensity with a subtle nuance. More often than not when I've read reviews like this it tells me the critic was more interested in appearing to be in touch with the art crowd than writing an honest review that said either this is crap or I didn't get what the point was here.For me with the amount of movies out there to watch, with the good, the bad and the ugly available either via Netflix, Redbox or the local store, I don't understand why anyone would waste time with something like this. To me it felt like time wasted that I can never recover. With the cost of a movie ticket or to purchase a DVD one has to wonder why anyone would consider something like this to be worth the amount of money they expect us to pay for it. Then again there are so many pretentious people in the world who want to make it seem as if they are so far above the fray that I'm sure this movie will at least make it's money back and cause another investor to put money into more films like it.

His codependent sister keeps leaving him messages early on  and he tries to avoid her but she shows up and moves in, making matters worse as she reminds him of their issues and thus do you get to see their dysfunctional relationship.The sexual scenes vary in tempo and style and tastes. At first one might think it's sexy but later on you realize it's a man with a really serious problem and then you're no longer feeling it. No pun intended. At times you see the pain on his features as he realizes he is going down a destructive path. At one point it looks like he's going to change but a failed love prompts him to return to his usual habits. And then something else happens and maybe he will change.The tale ends with the old question of whether the character will change or stay the same. I think that was the best they could do as they didn't want to make light on the addiction by just acting like he cured it in a few weeks.Interesting musical score of Old School piano music to balance the tempo of the film.Overall, a gutsy picture that went to a spot most people would fear. Once again, no pun intended.The budget for this intensive character study was $6.5M and it made a bit over $17M at the Box Office.CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B to B plus;  CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; THEME FOCUSES: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: early October 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus.SPOILERS: there's an intimacy between the dysfunctional brother and sister. Notice that at one point he deals with her nude and then vice versa. I found it interesting that Mulligan's character would say she was sorry yet she didn't apologize when he caught her masturbating.

Brandon (Fassbender) is a moderately successful sales manager that outwardly appears to be just a regular single guy in Manhattan.  Behind closed doors (or open windows) he can't get enough sex.  If he can't get it by picking up girls, he will resort to prostitutes or internet porn.  If that's inconvenient, then there's the old fashion do it yourself method.  He has no interest in relationships.  In the one tryst he has with a co-worker who wants something beyond sex, Brandon can't pull the trigger.  There's something clearly wrong with this guy.His life becomes complicated when his sister (Carey Mulligan in another terrific performance) shows up at his apartment uninvited.  Their initial encounter when he walks in on her in the shower alerts us that something is amiss.  He has an unusually long conversation with her as she stands before him in all her full frontal glory.  Hmm.  The siblings couldn't be more different.  Brandon is almost a recluse.  He socializes but only if there is a chance for sex.  Sissy (Mulligan) is talkative, effervescent and looking for fun. She is a troubled soul however.We see this initially when Brandon and his boss (James Badge Dale, TV's ""Rubicon"") go to a club where Sissy has a gig singing.  In a featured scene she sings a sorrowful rendition of  ""New York, New York"" that brings a tear to Brandon...and me.  In another scene, Sissy cuddles up to Brandon in the middle of the night.  He rightfully throws her out but why would she do that?  In another scene, she says to him ""we are not bad people; we just come from a bad place.""  Certainly a history of incest is suggested as the cause of their psychological damage.  Unfortunately, McQueen does little to flesh out this cause and effect background.The film is graphically presented in terms of language, nudity and sexual activity earning the NC-17 rating.  The performances by Fassbender and Mulligan are special and worthy of awards.  Many people will have trouble watching this film for a variety of reasons.

Many people may shy away from this great film due to the NC-17 rating and all the nudity. This movie is about a man (Michael Fassbender) who lives in NYC who appears to have a normal life to most, however he is a sex addict. He is the protagonist of our story, however throughout the film we are not sure if we really like this guy or not. He sees multiple women and retires to the bathroom at work daily to ""relive some pressure"". He has a very neat, scheduled, clean, organized life and has managed to control his urges the best he can.His life gets turned upside-down when his sister (Carey Mulligan) drops in on him and asks to live with him for a while. She causes a hiccup in his daily routine and his neat clean little world.The acting is brilliant. Fassbender is remarkable and gives a true deep performance. Mulligan also was outstanding, and in my opinion both actors are at the top of their game in this film. The interactions, dialogue and situations they are introduced to, are perfectly documented by the brilliant directing and classic, yet clean modern cinematography. Most of the scenes run very long with no cuts. It is a very raw film and wonderfully portrayed to the audience.The PQ & AQ are pristine and could not get any better. I blind bought this film after hearing so many good things about it. It is dark, it is sexual, however it is about the emptiness of a man who may seem he has it together, yet is very lost. I highly recommend this film to fans of underground, indie, or non-mainstream movies.

1510461,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B006512BFU,Paul Allaer,"[0, 1]","""Shame"" (101 min.) has become notorious for its subject matter and for its franks portrayal of that subject matter. Michael Fassbender stars as the sex addict who, despite his many partners, is unable to build a meaningful relationship. Michael's world is turned upside down by the unexpected visit from his sister Sissy, played by Carey Mulligan, who has nowhere else to stay and basically movies in, uninvited, in her brother's apartment. As the Fassbender character readjusts his life reluctantly, the one thing that sticks out is the utter loneliness of this man. Even when his sister begs him to open up a bit, he cannot.As the movie carries on, the storyline becomes somewhat preditable (reason for my overall rating of 3.5 stars), including the very obvious ending of the movie, but by then you simply marvel at the acting performances given by the lead actors. Fassbender has simpluy had a break-out year in 2011 with X-Men: First Class, A Dangerous Method, and now this (and already another movie ""Haywire"" out in the theatres). But for me the performance by Carey Mulligan was the true eye-opener, at a level only hinted at in her break-out movie ""An Education"" 2 years ago. She will be a screen talent for many more years to enjoy.One final note about the movie: director Steve McQueen frequently during the movie has the good sense of letting a scene unfold without having to change the camera angle or doing other unnecessary edits. Instead things just happen and we get to witness it. This may be challenging for some viewers in today's short-attention span society, but for me this is a welcome restraint of the dizzying ediiting that so many directors seem to insist on.",4,3.5 stars...

1510465,A3TMFCGB8MXCWE,B006512BFU,Rabid Reader,"[9, 9]","I watched this last night and had to let it digest before writing a review. This movie was far more painful and powerful than I expected it to be. The performances were excellent and multi-layered. I guess I thought it was going to be more about Brandon's (Michael Fassbender) sexual addiction, but it really was much more about making connections with people, emotional stress, the price of relationships. Yes, he turned to porn and prostitutes for release and relief from his otherwise tightly wound, buttoned up life that was carefully constructed to hide the pain surging beneath. But the real story was the tension between him and his sister, the beautiful and frail but manipulative Sissy (hope I'm spelling that right), whose instability leashed them together. They never talked explicitly about their past, but you knew something had to have happened to them to make them this way. They were like shell-shocked survivors of a war who never learned how to function in ""normal"" society. But then the movie also does a great job of peeling back the layer on what is ""normal"" as well, when it shows Brandon's married boss having a loving chat with his son one minute, then sleeping with Sissy the next, with no regard for a tortured Brandon in the next room. There is also a flirtatous yet married woman on the subway who is the narrative arc tying together the beginning and end of the tale. Of all of them, Brandon seems to be the one who truly craves a connection with another human being, while everyone around him is just throwing away what comes so easily to them. Very emotional, and really makes you think.

1510474,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B006512BFU,RMurray847,"[150, 161]","WARNING:  While not explicit, per se...this review does touch on some subject matter some folks might simply not want to read about.  I don't mean to offend anyone, but there's no way to review the movie otherwise, in my opinion.SHAME has been called the ""movie about the sex addict"" and this is a rather unfair over-simplification.  It also implies that there might be lots of juicy sex scenes, especially given its NC-17 rating.  If THIS is what you're expecting, you are in for a disappointment.Director Steve McQueen's film is a character study of one very specific sex addict, Brandon (Michael Fassbender).  And I'm not even sure if Brandon is a sex addict or something different.  He is certainly a man driven to spending virtually all his spare time (and much of his time at work) viewing porn and pleasuring himself.  He spends lots of money on prostitutes.  He is also attractive enough to draw yearning from women looking for a good time and a quickie in an alley (literally at one point).  But NONE of these activities give him any pleasure whatsoever.  In fact, he seems to suffer a psychic pain at his despair in not truly drawing any pleasure from his compulsions.  I read one review in which the viewer describes him as a ""monster.""  I felt much the opposite...he is a creature to be pitied.  Having said that, I felt pity mostly because we saw everything from Brandon's perspective.  Not much attention is paid to the damage he may be causing others (with one key exception, which I'll discuss below)...therefore, we see HIS torment and HIS unhappiness and HIS damage.  It's hard not to feel sorry for him, even as we're repulsed by his activities.  This is a smart guy who knows better...but his self-knowledge only makes him hate himself more...it does not curtail his destructive activities.Brandon's specific damage is linked to the damage his sister carries (Carey Mulligan).  She, too, is looking for love and is deeply unhappy.  When she moves, unasked, into Brandon's spartan NYC apartment, she is an interloper on his privacy, but more importantly, she reignites unhealthy feelings each shares for the other.  They are very open with each other about their bodies (there is a long scene where the two have a heated exchange which she stands naked in the shower, and makes no effort to cover).  They give each other longing looks.  They've clearly both been damaged by events in their childhoods, and this has created a strong but very unhealthy bond between the two.  Brandon senses it more than she, but his efforts to push her away are damaging to both of them.SHAME is a well-crafted film.  There are many interesting shots.  In one, Brandon is running down an avenue, and the camera tracks him for several blocks, in one long take.  In another scene, Brandon and a co-worker are on a first date at a restaurant, and one long shot captures the first several minutes of the date...from amusing encounters with the waiter to telling moments of conversation.  It's a fascinating and engaging scene that a viewer will either find riveting (because so many little moments are so telling) or dull as can be (because they talk about so little and the camera is so still).  And there's another scene in which Brandon's sister sings a VERY slow version of ""New York, New York"" in a nightclub, while Brandon listens.  The torment they each express is gripping, and with almost no words (beyond the lyrics of the song) we learn an awful lot about their relationship.Mulligan is outstanding in her role, and she should be in the Oscar conversation.  She exposes herself physically in unflattering ways, but is heartbreaking as well.  Fassbender is riveting as well.  His performance is daring in that he has totally committed to this pitiable, unlikeable role in such a way that after just over ninety minutes, we feel we know Brandon about as well as we have ever known a movie character.  We don't know the facts of his past, or quite what he does for a living.  But we know his pain.  We see how his mind works.  Yes, there's also full frontal...but that seems less brave than the anguish he puts himself through.The sex in the film is actually not a whole lot more explicit than what you'd see in an R-rated movie.  It's the casual nudity in other scenes that got the NC-17 rating.  But none of it is titillating or erotic.  This is a movie that shows sex is not only NOT a substitute for meaningful human contact but can actually destroy goodness, ambition, empathy and humanity.  Sobering stuff.SHAME is a well-made film, extremely well acted, that will absolutely turn off most viewers.  This is not to say that someone only ""sophisticated"" viewers or ""daring"" viewers will like it.  I admired it greatly, but didn't enjoy it.  It shows ugly, unpleasant things happening...even if you aren't bored by the slow pace, you might be greatly put-off by the subject matter or the view of humanity it posits.  I'd say ""see it,"" but if you hate it...don't blame me for wasting your time.  I've probably not seen a film that is more of a ""viewer beware...you may both LOVE and HATE this film at the same time"" since BLUE VELVET.",4,Fantastic filmmaking that's still hard to

1510475,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B006512BFU,Robin Friedman,"[4, 5]","Directed by Steve McQueen, ""Shame"" explores sexual addiction, alienation, and loneliness in contemporary New York City. With its many sex scenes, the film manages to be unerotic. The movie and its actors have received numerous accolades. The acting is convincing and the scenes of city life well drawn. Many viewers will find this film disturbing.The film stars Michael Fassbender as a successful 30ish professional named Brandon who cannot control his sexual appetites or channel his sexuality into a relationship. Brandon is both a predator and a victim. He is apparently able to pick up attractive similarly lonely women on the spot for short encounters. Brandon also uses the services of prostitutes. When he is home alone, he watches pornography and camgirls on his computer. He gets confronted with a wide range of pornographic material on his office computer. He is unable to function in an attempted relationship with a coworker, Marianne, (Nichole Beharie) which involves attempted emotion beyond sex. Fassbender plays this role well in his lines, dress, gestures, and facial expressions. He has a sense of decency and is at war with himself.The other primary character in ""Shame"" is Brandon's younger sister Sissie played by Carrie Mulligan. Sissie has suicidal tendencies and is emotionally needy. She moves in with Brandon early in the film and the emotional tension mounts between the siblings as the movie progresses. Each sees the serious, devastating issues in the life of the other. Brandon's sexual addition and his relationship with Sissie become intertwined and form the two themes of this movie.The movie makes have use of atmosphere to establish the sordid character of Brandon's mind. There are many scenes of crowded subways which capture the lonely, solitary character of much urban life. There are pick-up scenes in bars, from the fancy to the seedy, which stress lack of emotional connection. The movie shows several scenes of paid sex between Brandon and various women together with the shame and sadness felt by both parties. The musical score is ominous and brooding, punctuated by Glenn Gould playing Bach and by various pop songs. Sissie is trying to make it as a singer and, in a pivotal scene of the movie, offers a rendition of ""New York New York"" in the company of Brandon and his boss.The movie includes substantial nudity, male and female. To their credit, the producers declined to soften the movie to receive an ""R"" rather than a ""NC-17"" rating. The movie offers an effective portrayal of how sex can become a narcotic to deal with loneliness in a harsh world.Note;  This review originally posted on Amazon on December 26, 2011, but was inexplicably deleted.Robin Friedman",5,Shame,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,2712,"['Directed', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Shame', 'sexual', 'addiction', 'alienation', 'loneliness', 'contemporary', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'many', 'sex', 'scenes', 'film', 'be', 'unerotic', 'movie', 'actors', 'have', 'received', 'numerous', 'accolades', 'acting', 'convincing', 'scenes', 'city', 'life', 'well', 'drawn', 'Many', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'disturbing.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'successful', '30ish', 'professional', 'named', 'Brandon', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'sexual', 'appetites', 'channel', 'sexuality', 'relationship', 'Brandon', 'predator', 'victim', 'apparently', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'attractive', 'similarly', 'lonely', 'women', 'spot', 'short', 'encounters', 'Brandon', 'also', 'services', 'prostitutes', 'When', 'home', 'alone', 'pornography', 'camgirls', 'computer', 'confronted', 'wide', 'range', 'pornographic', 'material', 'office', 'computer', 'unable', 'function', 'attempted', 'relationship', 'coworker', 'Marianne', 'Nichole', 'Beharie', 'attempted', 'emotion', 'sex', 'Fassbender', 'role', 'well', 'lines', 'dress', 'gestures', 'facial', 'expressions', 'sense', 'decency', 'war', 'himself.The', 'other', 'primary', 'character', 'Shame', 'Brandon', 'younger', 'sister', 'Sissie', 'played', 'Carrie', 'Mulligan', 'Sissie', 'suicidal', 'tendencies', 'emotionally', 'needy', 'Brandon', 'early', 'film', 'emotional', 'tension', 'mounts', 'siblings', 'movie', 'serious', 'devastating', 'issues', 'life', 'other', 'Brandon', 'sexual', 'addition', 'relationship', 'Sissie', 'become', 'intertwined', 'form', 'two', 'themes', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'have', 'use', 'atmosphere', 'establish', 'sordid', 'character', 'Brandon', 'mind', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'crowded', 'subways', 'capture', 'lonely', 'solitary', 'character', 'much', 'urban', 'life', 'are', 'pick-up', 'scenes', 'bars', 'fancy', 'seedy', 'stress', 'lack', 'emotional', 'connection', 'movie', 'several', 'scenes', 'paid', 'sex', 'Brandon', 'various', 'women', 'together', 'shame', 'sadness', 'felt', 'parties', 'musical', 'score', 'ominous', 'brooding', 'punctuated', 'Glenn', 'Gould', 'playing', 'Bach', 'various', 'pop', 'songs', 'Sissie', 'trying', 'make', 'singer', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'movie', 'rendition', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'company', 'Brandon', 'boss.The', 'movie', 'substantial', 'nudity', 'male', 'female', 'credit', 'producers', 'declined', 'soften', 'movie', 'receive', 'R', 'rather', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'movie', 'effective', 'portrayal', 'how', 'sex', 'can', 'become', 'narcotic', 'deal', 'loneliness', 'harsh', 'world.Note', 'review', 'originally', 'posted', 'Amazon', 'December', '26', '2011', 'was', 'inexplicably', 'deleted.Robin', 'Friedman']",Shame Region 2
1510476,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B006512BFU,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 5]","His name is Brandon and he is a sex addict.  He spends virtually his entire waking life either having sex, planning on having sex, or watching others have sex.How he got to be this way is never fully explained in the screenplay by Steve McQueen (who also directed the movie) and Abi Morgan, though it is darkly hinted that it might have something to do with some form of sexual abuse in the character's past.  This is particularly likely given the unhealthy proclivity he seems to have for his even more lost and dysfunctional sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan), who comes to live with him in his Manhattan penthouse early on in the movie.  Brandon will do it with just about anyone - though he seems to have drawn the line at Sissy, at least based on the struggling and angst he undergoes in her presence, though we`re never quite sure about what might have happened between the two of them in the past.  Of course, the fact that Brandon is sexy and handsome means he's never at a loss for willing and attractive partners.  It is also no surprise that the one woman (Nicole Beharie) who actually gets into his head and possibly even his heart - a co-worker who thinks there should be more to relationships than mere one-night stands - is the one for whom he is unable to perform in the only way he knows how.""Shame"" is a subtle and provocative drama that explores how sex and sexuality have changed in the modern era - in some ways for the better and in many ways for the worse.  Certainly Brandon and Sissy demonstrate some of the pitfalls inherent in a world where sex is so readily available, thanks in large part to advancements in technology, the proliferation of porn, and relaxed social mores.

It presents us to them in all their physical and emotional nakedness, then lets us render our own judgment on them - or lack thereof.In a brave and soul-baring performance, Michael Fassbender brings a rawness and a vulnerability to the role of Brandon that allow us to feel for the character without ever begging for our pity.

1510483,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B006512BFU,Steve,"[5, 6]","Shame is a disturbing and painful movie to watch for many reasons, not the least of which may be the mirror it holds up to us.  In a slow, quiet, and uninhibited style, director Steve McQueen takes us into the life of Brandon, a successful Manhattan-ite, and his ne'er do well sister, two tormented souls who might just as easily be seen as two sides of the same coin. Brandon is sterile and emotionally vacant and Sissy is a raging co-dependent whose emotions are always boiling at the surface. Both address their emotional issues with sex, Sissy hoping that every new encounter brings her the caretaker she so desperately needs and Brandon seeking only the cold anonymous release.The movie is intense, not so much for the sex (although it isn't going to be to everyone's taste), but rather because it forces us to look at how we deal with our own issues. It might make us feel better to delineate between ""addicts"" and the rest of us, but this is merely semantics. Putting a tag on someone because it distances their behavior from yours doesn't make you superior. Shame demonstrates that ""addicts"" (a term vastly over-used) are people who aren't handling their problems in the right way. They are not deviants or sickos or freaks, but wounded human beings - just like you. While most of us haven't sunk as low as these two, we still have our compulsions. Maybe you over-eat, are an exercise freak, or shop incessantly - one way or another we have to deal with our insecurities, traumas, and stress in some way or else we fall apart. Shame is an exploration of two people who use sex to ease their psychological pain, but what I liked about this movie was that it showed how universal our problems are. It's only in how we deal with it that we see differences, and hopefully Shame points out that disgust merely hides hypocrisy, and thus denial for those who can't see at least a little of themselves in these wounded and sympathetic characters.",4,The face in the mirror,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,1946,"['Shame', 'disturbing', 'painful', 'movie', 'watch', 'many', 'reasons', 'not', 'least', 'may', 'be', 'mirror', 'slow', 'quiet', 'uninhibited', 'style', 'director', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'life', 'Brandon', 'successful', 'Manhattan-ite', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'sister', 'two', 'tormented', 'souls', 'who', 'might', 'just', 'easily', 'be', 'seen', 'two', 'sides', 'same', 'coin', 'Brandon', 'sterile', 'emotionally', 'vacant', 'Sissy', 'raging', 'co-dependent', 'emotions', 'are', 'always', 'boiling', 'surface', 'address', 'emotional', 'issues', 'sex', 'Sissy', 'hoping', 'new', 'encounter', 'caretaker', 'so', 'desperately', 'needs', 'Brandon', 'seeking', 'only', 'cold', 'anonymous', 'release.The', 'movie', 'intense', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'sex', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'everyone', 'taste', 'rather', 'look', 'how', 'deal', 'own', 'issues', 'might', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'delineate', 'addicts', 'rest', 'merely', 'semantics', 'Putting', 'tag', 'someone', 'behavior', 'yours', ""n't"", 'make', 'superior', 'Shame', 'addicts', 'term', 'vastly', 'over-used', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'handling', 'problems', 'right', 'way', 'are', 'not', 'deviants', 'sickos', 'freaks', 'wounded', 'human', 'beings', 'just', 'most', 'have', ""n't"", 'sunk', 'as', 'low', 'two', 'still', 'have', 'compulsions', 'Maybe', 'over-eat', 'are', 'exercise', 'freak', 'shop', 'incessantly', 'one', 'way', 'have', 'deal', 'insecurities', 'traumas', 'stress', 'way', 'else', 'fall', 'apart', 'Shame', 'exploration', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'use', 'sex', 'ease', 'psychological', 'pain', 'what', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'showed', 'how', 'universal', 'problems', 'are', 'only', 'how', 'deal', 'see', 'differences', 'hopefully', 'Shame', 'out', 'disgust', 'merely', 'hides', 'hypocrisy', 'thus', 'denial', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'least', 'little', 'wounded', 'sympathetic', 'characters']",Shame Region 2

With his debut feature, `Hunger', he was able to pull an amazing performance out of the incredibly versatile Michael Fassbender, and he does the same here.The aptly titled `Shame' centers around a man named Brandon Sullivan. Brandon seems to lead the perfect life. He has the perfect job, lives comfortably in an upscale apartment in New York, and is strikingly handsome and healthy for a man in his late thirties. All of his friends seem to love him, and he gets along quite well with his boss and co-workers. However, Brandon is living in darkness. The truth is that Brandon has been struggling with sexual addiction for quite some time, and as we will see throughout the course of the film, it has begun to devour him completely. Unable to form intimate bonds and meaningful relationships, Brandon has become a slave to his most carnal desires. His life consists of casual trysts with prostitutes and random men and women from clubs and bars, sexual encounters over the webcam, voyeurism, and compulsive masturbation - not to mention a drug habit.When his emotionally damaged sister, Sissy, unexpectedly shows up at his apartment in need of a place to stay, she quickly becomes a nuisance in his life, placing a barrier between Brandon and his addiction. When she discovers his dark secret, she is appalled at first, but attempts to lead him to the path of recovery by reminding him that he is loved. These two damaged souls need one another to survive.As the pressure mounts, Brandon's life begins to unravel. He goes to the very depths of hell and back. He begins to lose control, until one day when he is forced to deal with his demons head on.There is hope for Brandon yet.The performances in `Shame' are magnificent. Michael Fassbender delivers an Oscar worthy performance as the tortured Brandon. It is a tragedy that he was somehow overlooked for this years Oscar race. Carey Mulligan is equally powerful as Sissy. She was extraordinary in `An Education', and continues to impress with her monumental work here. The cinematography is gorgeous, and the score is haunting as well. All technical and artistic aspects are perfect.This is an exceptionally powerful film, and it is not recommended for those who are easily offended. Director Steve McQueen refused to censor this material to gain an R rating, and so the film was branded with a well-deserved NC-17 rating. The sexual content is extremely explicit, but serves a purpose within the context of the film, and is never gratuitous. If you are seeking titillation, you will not find it here. Onscreen sex has never looked so repulsive. Sex addiction is a serious issue that is rarely dealt with in the cinema. Steve McQueen tackles the subject with respect and constraint. The results are disturbing and rewarding. `Shame' is one of the best films of 2012.Rated NC-17 for explicit sexual content, 101 minutes, directed by Steve McQueen, released by Fox Searchlight Pictures.",5,Steve McQueen's 'Shame' is a fantastic character study.,1329523200,"02 18, 2012",2012,3062,"['Steve', 'McQueen', 'sophomore', 'feature', 'officially', 'director', 'status', 'one', 'greats', 'McQueen', 'one', 'watch', 'debut', 'feature', 'Hunger', 'was', 'able', 'pull', 'amazing', 'performance', 'incredibly', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'same', 'here.The', 'aptly', 'titled', 'Shame', 'centers', 'man', 'named', 'Brandon', 'Sullivan', 'Brandon', 'lead', 'perfect', 'life', 'perfect', 'job', 'comfortably', 'upscale', 'apartment', 'New', 'York', 'strikingly', 'handsome', 'healthy', 'man', 'late', 'thirties', 'friends', 'seem', 'love', 'quite', 'well', 'boss', 'co-workers', 'However', 'Brandon', 'living', 'darkness', 'truth', 'Brandon', 'been', 'struggling', 'sexual', 'addiction', 'quite', 'time', 'will', 'see', 'course', 'film', 'begun', 'devour', 'completely', 'Unable', 'form', 'intimate', 'bonds', 'meaningful', 'relationships', 'Brandon', 'become', 'slave', 'most', 'carnal', 'desires', 'life', 'casual', 'trysts', 'prostitutes', 'random', 'men', 'women', 'clubs', 'bars', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'webcam', 'voyeurism', 'compulsive', 'masturbation', 'not', 'mention', 'drug', 'emotionally', 'damaged', 'sister', 'Sissy', 'unexpectedly', 'up', 'apartment', 'need', 'place', 'stay', 'quickly', 'nuisance', 'life', 'placing', 'barrier', 'Brandon', 'addiction', 'When', 'dark', 'secret', 'appalled', 'first', 'attempts', 'lead', 'path', 'recovery', 'reminding', 'loved', 'two', 'damaged', 'souls', 'need', 'one', 'survive.As', 'pressure', 'mounts', 'Brandon', 'life', 'unravel', 'very', 'depths', 'hell', 'back', 'lose', 'control', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'forced', 'deal', 'demons', 'head', 'hope', 'Brandon', 'yet.The', 'performances', 'Shame', 'are', 'magnificent', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'tortured', 'Brandon', 'tragedy', 'was', 'somehow', 'overlooked', 'years', 'Oscar', 'race', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'equally', 'powerful', 'Sissy', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'Education', 'impress', 'monumental', 'work', 'here', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'score', 'haunting', 'as', 'well', 'technical', 'artistic', 'aspects', 'are', 'perfect.This', 'exceptionally', 'powerful', 'film', 'not', 'recommended', 'who', 'are', 'easily', 'offended', 'Director', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'refused', 'censor', 'material', 'gain', 'R', 'rating', 'so', 'film', 'was', 'branded', 'well-deserved', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'sexual', 'content', 'extremely', 'explicit', 'purpose', 'context', 'film', 'never', 'gratuitous', 'are', 'seeking', 'titillation', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'here', 'Onscreen', 'sex', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'repulsive', 'Sex', 'addiction', 'serious', 'issue', 'rarely', 'dealt', 'cinema', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'subject', 'respect', 'constraint', 'results', 'are', 'disturbing', 'rewarding', 'Shame', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2012.Rated', 'NC-17', 'explicit', 'sexual', 'content', '101', 'minutes', 'directed', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'released', 'Fox', 'Searchlight', 'Pictures']",Shame Region 2

All that media buzz around him is all true. His performance is one of the more brilliant any of us is likely to see in the movies.  While Carey Mulligan struggles extravagantly to hold her own as his pathologically messed up pain-in-the-ass sister, it remains Michael Fassbinder's picture from first shot through last frame.The essence of sexual addiction is an inability to find satisfaction, those few moments of post-orgasmic repose that allow--however briefly--a fleeting balm of peace with ourselves and a temporary truce with the world to settle around us, and just for right now, for everything to be o.k.  Ay, there's the rub. Shame perfectly captures the relentless, desperate yearning for just a breath or two of minuscule relief, the micro-timeout, that never, ever arrives. Godot has already come and long since blown this scene.There is the possibility that in your life, you've not yet had the occasion to ponder the hell realm of sexual--or of any flavor, for that matter--addiction. In which case, this could be fascinating unknown territory for you to explore. But if you've already experienced a glimpse of absolute despair, there's really no need to sumerge yourself in a 100 minute cinematic buzz-kill that goes absolutely nowhere, no matter how artfully it is rendered.There is also a surfeit of dark New York streets punctuated by the angst of lost subway lust. The neo-noir textures could not feel more authentic.Oh!  Right.  About all the nudity.  Should the mild titillation of semi-soft-core full frontal hold some attraction, this is the wrong place to look for gratification.  Sure, there's plenty of skin and the bodies are all nice enough, but it's 180 opposite from a turn-on. Unless, that is, you are of the more kinked persuasion, say the sort who appreciates a cin&eacute;ma veriti&eacute;-style shot of a buck naked Fassbinder's backside as he pisses into his own toilet without bothering to raise the seat (Yes, his sister is staying in his apartment at the time. Passive-aggressive? You think?), then jiggles the post-penal drip from his dangling dick's famously generous foreskin.

It's really an art film or indie film that didn't get a lot of attention at the box office, but became the darling a various film festivals around the world. &#34;Shame&#34; also made its star, Michael Fassbender, a hot commodity in Hollywood and London.The movie delves into the controversial subject of male sexual addiction, its effects on the man and how it effects those around him.Brandon (the Fassbender character) has everything a man in his '30's wants: a well-paying job, women falling for him left and right and a great apartment. Yet, something eludes him and bothers him.

1510488,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B006512BFU,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","This is an artsy adult film about a socially inept man addicted to porn, particularly Internet porn. His NY apartment is furnished a bit Spartan. His boring life is interrupted when his sister, Carey Mulligan comes to stay. There is an awkward scene where he stares at her naked body while she showers. It is designed to show how dysfunctional and creepy Brandon has become in life, like the long drawn out subway scene. His sister is in a bad relationship and is as dysfunctional as Brandon. She is a nightclub singer. The suicidal Carey is desperate for intimacy as is hinted in so many scenes.Brandon's dysfunction is apparently from living a semi-isolated life on a computer. His obsession with casual sex, porn, and masturbation causes problems in his life which escalates as the film progresses. Brandon realizes he has issues and takes steps to resolve those issues, but has trouble moving forward toward a normal sexual relationship that involves intimacy and only compounds things.Fassbender and McQueen did an excellent job in capturing the character of Brandon as we see his despair, grief, and isolation. This is the type of film in which I had to watch the whole thing to decide if I liked it or not depending on the ending. After seeing the ending, I am still not sure, which is why I have opted to sit on the fence post at 3 stars. Oh wait!

1510489,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B006512BFU,Tony Heck,"[3, 3]","""We're not bad people, we just come from a bad place."" Brandon (Fassbender) is a very private person. He does his job well and takes the subway to and from work. He doesn't have many close friends, but that fits his life style. Brandon is an extreme sex addict. He lives his life how he wants until his sister Sissy (Mulligan) shows up unannounced. He does his best to hide his addiction from her, but somethings aren't that easy. First of all I have to say that this is a really good movie. That said it's not easy to watch. Fassbender is amazing in this and I have no idea why he didn't get nominated. I'm guessing because the movie is NC-17 and there is a lot of sex and nudity. That aside watching him struggle with his addiction with few words is really mesmerizing. I can compare this to ""Drive"" in the style and the pacing, few words but powerful actions. Brandon is one of the most unlikeable characters I have seen lately but the entire time you really want him to change and you end up sympathizing and identifying with Sissy through out most of the movie. Movies that polarize you like that are an adventure to watch and you seem to get more out of it. All that said I do recommend this. Overall, A great but hard movie to watch, very emotional.

1510491,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B006512BFU,Turfseer,"[18, 46]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 1.5I'm still trying to figure out why this film has received so many accolades from the media. Perhaps it's director Steve McQueen's visceral style and the performer's intense performances. But none of this can make up for the vapid, manipulative screenplay, featuring characters we learn next to nothing about.McQueen's protagonist is 'Brandon', a sex addict who appears to be angry at the world for largely unknown reasons. The one thing that Brandon is clearly resentful about, is having to put his co-dependent sister, Sissy, up in his apartment. Sissy alludes to the fact that they were both abused as children but we never learn any significant details about the abuse. Sissy turns out to be a wholly unsympathetic character, a freeloader who expects her brother to take care of her.We end up getting a brief peek at Brandon's work world when we're introduced to his obnoxious boss, David, who flatters every woman he meets, and gets nowhere. In contrast, bad boy Brandon acts disinterested with the same women David tries to score with, and becomes an instant babe magnet. The best loser David can do is bed Sissy at Brandon's apartment, with the angry brother, seething, as he's forced to listen to the sounds of their lovemaking inside the bedroom.McQueen has an annoying habit of holding shots for too long. There's a wholly unnecessary scene where we see Brandon urinating in the bathroom from a distance. Ditto when Sissy sings an awfully slow rendition of 'New York, New York' during her gig as a lounge singer.Eventually, Brandon has a 'normal' date with Nicole but admits to her over dinner that the longest relationship he's ever had was four months. When he attempts to have sex with her, this time he's a complete flop, as he's unable to cope with the intimacy of a more genuine encounter.By now, we realize that Writer/Director McQueen has no additional aces to play. Brandon is hardly someone we can care about because McQueen doesn't know how to develop his characters. Yes, we 'get it' early on that Brandon is an emotionally stunted, cut-off individual who uses sex do dull his inner turmoil, just like any addict. After watching one mechanical sex scene after another, culminating in Brandon's particularly dull encounter at a gay sex club (which is supposed to represent the apotheosis of his desperate fixation), our sympathy for this loser of a protagonist, has reached its lowest nadir.Now McQueen aims to redeem Brandon through a decided, manipulative, sleight of hand. The police action in the subway station which Brandon is about to disembark at, leads one to believe that someone has jumped on to the tracks. Could it be sister Sissy? Brandon runs out of the station and up to his apartment, only to find that Sissy has opted for a much more conventional attempt at suicide--she's a bloody mess after slitting her wrists. It's taken the shock of almost losing his sister, to wake Brandon up. At film's end, director McQueen implies that Brandon will no longer be cruising the streets for his next pick up.Take away all the slick cinematography and one is left with the standard melodrama of a sad sack who can't stand himself and hates the world. McQueen, and other uninspired film makers like him, believes this is enough for character development. But for those who appreciate the craft of screen writing, only fully realized, BELIEVABLE and sympathetic characters, should populate the pages of a screenplay, the particular type, that truly deserves all the honors bestowed upon it.",1,Writer/director's second effort proves to be an uninspiring portrait of a sad sack sex addict,1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,3565,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Rating', '1.5I', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'film', 'received', 'so', 'many', 'accolades', 'media', 'Perhaps', 'director', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'visceral', 'style', 'performer', 'intense', 'performances', 'none', 'can', 'make', 'up', 'vapid', 'manipulative', 'screenplay', 'featuring', 'characters', 'learn', 'next', 'nothing', 'about.McQueen', 'protagonist', ""'Brandon"", 'sex', 'addict', 'who', 'be', 'angry', 'world', 'largely', 'unknown', 'reasons', 'one', 'thing', 'Brandon', 'clearly', 'resentful', 'having', 'put', 'co-dependent', 'sister', 'Sissy', 'up', 'apartment', 'Sissy', 'fact', 'were', 'abused', 'children', 'never', 'learn', 'significant', 'details', 'abuse', 'Sissy', 'out', 'be', 'wholly', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'freeloader', 'who', 'brother', 'take', 'care', 'her.We', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'brief', 'peek', 'Brandon', 'work', 'world', 'when', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'obnoxious', 'boss', 'David', 'who', 'woman', 'nowhere', 'contrast', 'bad', 'boy', 'Brandon', 'disinterested', 'same', 'women', 'David', 'score', 'instant', 'babe', 'magnet', 'best', 'loser', 'David', 'can', 'do', 'bed', 'Sissy', 'Brandon', 'apartment', 'angry', 'brother', 'seething', 'forced', 'listen', 'sounds', 'lovemaking', 'bedroom.McQueen', 'annoying', 'habit', 'holding', 'shots', 'too', 'long', 'wholly', 'unnecessary', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'Brandon', 'urinating', 'bathroom', 'distance', 'Ditto', 'when', 'Sissy', 'awfully', 'slow', 'rendition', ""'New"", 'York', 'New', 'York', 'gig', 'lounge', 'singer.Eventually', 'Brandon', ""'normal"", 'date', 'Nicole', 'dinner', 'longest', 'relationship', 'ever', 'had', 'was', 'four', 'months', 'When', 'have', 'sex', 'time', 'complete', 'flop', 'unable', 'cope', 'intimacy', 'more', 'genuine', 'encounter.By', 'now', 'realize', 'Writer/Director', 'McQueen', 'additional', 'aces', 'play', 'Brandon', 'hardly', 'someone', 'can', 'care', 'because', 'McQueen', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'develop', 'characters', 'Yes', ""'get"", 'early', 'Brandon', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'cut-off', 'individual', 'who', 'sex', 'do', 'dull', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'just', 'addict', 'watching', 'one', 'mechanical', 'sex', 'scene', 'culminating', 'Brandon', 'particularly', 'dull', 'encounter', 'gay', 'sex', 'club', 'supposed', 'represent', 'apotheosis', 'desperate', 'fixation', 'sympathy', 'loser', 'protagonist', 'reached', 'lowest', 'nadir.Now', 'McQueen', 'redeem', 'Brandon', 'decided', 'manipulative', 'sleight', 'hand', 'police', 'action', 'subway', 'station', 'Brandon', 'disembark', 'one', 'believe', 'someone', 'jumped', 'tracks', 'Could', 'be', 'sister', 'Sissy', 'Brandon', 'station', 'up', 'apartment', 'only', 'find', 'Sissy', 'opted', 'much', 'more', 'conventional', 'attempt', 'suicide', 'bloody', 'mess', 'slitting', 'wrists', 'taken', 'shock', 'almost', 'losing', 'sister', 'wake', 'Brandon', 'up', 'film', 'end', 'director', 'McQueen', 'Brandon', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'cruising', 'streets', 'next', 'pick', 'up.Take', 'away', 'slick', 'cinematography', 'one', 'left', 'standard', 'melodrama', 'sad', 'sack', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'world', 'McQueen', 'other', 'uninspired', 'film', 'makers', 'enough', 'character', 'development', 'who', 'appreciate', 'craft', 'screen', 'writing', 'only', 'fully', 'realized', 'BELIEVABLE', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'should', 'populate', 'pages', 'screenplay', 'particular', 'type', 'truly', 'honors', 'bestowed']",Shame Region 2

1510494,A4YXKE5F62II8,B006512BFU,Visual Bureau,"[1, 2]","""The controversial drama, Shame, directed by Steve McQueen, is one of the rare films these days that has received an NC-17 rating solely based on the sex and nudity depicted. Much to surprise and years of experience watching films, the content while frank and mature is treated with responsibility and a sense of melancholy not found in many R-rated films for that matter. Shame's treatment of human functions and crude material is not the same as The Hangover, Freddy Got Fingered, or Scary Movie, for example.Aside from that acknowledgment, the story examines Brandon, a loner in New York conflicted with his own perverted vices which in turn get worse as he becomes more alienated with his estranged sister who is a singer. The film's examination of the man is a one of sorrow and frustration often taking very extended scenes of him running down the city, looking down being quiet, or talking and chatting to sexual encounters he meets in the town.The way McQueen makes you approach the subject did certainly break a few corners of patience with audiences but for what it is, it did stood out much in the same way that Trainspotting or Requiem for a Dream did by glimpsing on addiction in itself (which is a bigger theme here) and its problems. The cinematography and music scheme here are responsibly done and very minimalistic yet brooding for what it is that you almost think is this man really worth your time to watch or is just an object?As a whole, Shame is not a very good film as it is but it is a prolonged and graphic example of how human decisions and lack of self-control can leave a trail of multiple issues not asked for. Thankfully, the film was used as a talking piece for many addiction committees and organizations across the United States which has rendered the scary, horrific, mysterious NC-17 to feel more like an R (in which the film could have earned if, by MPAA rule, trimmed any sight of nudity or focus of protracted action).

1510496,A366K6G0ISLX7Q,B006512BFU,vs,"[2, 6]","This film is visually good, many scenes in Manhattan, especially those shot outside, in the streets and subway, are very powerful and charged with emotion because of masterful use of color and scenery. On the other hand, sexual scenes are dull and somewhat boring (maybe this is intentional, I'm not sure).Sometimes, though, visual effects are overdone, as in the scene of Sissy's suicide attempt: all this bright red blood on bright white walls and floor looks artificial, shown just to make strong impression on the viewer.Otherwise this is a rather average movie, the plot isn't too convincing, Brandon's ""sexual addiction"" doesn't seem to be getting that much in the way of his life, and his failure to help his sister should be attributed more to his general callousness; to be fair, her situation requires more support and effort than an average person can easily provide.The Fassbender's performance in this film I find rather wooden (maybe this is intentional too though). I liked Carey Mulligan very much in An Education, but in this movie I don't find her as good. I attribute this mostly to the character she plays, which is not developed enough to be convincing. The best performed role, to my taste, is that played by Mari-Ange Ramirez. Yes, it's a secondary role, one episode, really, but somehow her play is very convincing and appealing.I'd like to repeat: McQueen, to my perception, failed to show (or I failed to see) convincingly Brandon's sex addiction. Prostitutes? Pornography? Masturbation? Homoerotic acts? But, sorry for asking, is there anybody left who's not doing this, and that, and that - full time including his time in the [Oval] office? Senators, governors, any and every public figure is involved in adultery, exhibitionism, just name it. President's security detail - being on duty - are involved in prostitution scandal in Colombia.So why is an average guy supposed to be any different?

1510498,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B006512BFU,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 2]","""Shame"" features a pair of stunning performances from Michael Fassbinder and Carey Mulligan as a damaged brother and sister with their own way of coping with emotional damage. So why not five stars? Although I liked this movie quite a bit especially Fassbinger's amazing performance (no pun intended), it's not something I would watch more than once or twice. ""Shame"" is both a powerful and harrowing experience and it's not something I'm likely to return to simply for entertainment value although co-writer and director Steve McQueen creates an amazingly powerful minimalist drama.SPOILERS:Fassbinger plays Brandon a sex addict who's life is turned upside down by the unexpected arrival of his sister Sissy (Mulligan)who has issues of her own. Brandon is unable to connect emotionally with anyone and uses sex to feel...anything with anyone.END OF SPOILERS:A graphic and emotionally powerful film ""Shame"" won't be for everyone (be warned that there is quite a bit of nudity in the film and scenes where the characters are--not surprisingly--having sex). Fassinberg gives a stunning performance making Brandon surprisingly likeable and appealing despite his cold, disconnected nature. It's clear why woman like him--he's charming and notices small details about them but it's also clear that even though Brandon wouldn't admit it, he has a self loathing which prevents him from developing any sort of relationship with anyone beyond the purely physical (and even then only for one night stands).The Blu-ray looks positively stunning with a nice audio mix although most of the activity is in the front speakers (there is a fair amount of ambient activity in the rear).The special features (if it matters to you)are limited to a series of brief featurettes.""Focus on Michael Fassbender"",  ""Director Steve McQueen"",""The Story of Shame"", ""In A Shared Vision"", "" Fox Movie Channel Presents: In Character with Michael Fassbender"" and film's theatrical trailer (1:47/HD) as well as previews. Most of the featurettes run around 3 minutes or so. A commentary track by the director and actors would have been interesting and welcome.There's also a digital copy (Edit: This film is available on itunes to buy) as well as DVD.I'd suggest renting rather ""Shame"" first before making the committment to buy it and see if it is your type of movie (and to see if it's one you'll want to watch more than one time).
