1107835,A3U5Z6UTIJ8FZ9,B000WC38BO,"1.5 Trick Pony ""SuperDuper""","[72, 101]","I'm trying to find a good DVD to exercise, and I thought I'd try ballet - hey, who doesn't want to be more graceful, lean, and strong?  All the other DVDs I saw reviewed on Amazon seemed to be for an existing dancer (which I'm not!) to refine technique, or a mix of ballet-Pilates or ballet-yoga.So you know who's doing this review - I'm very tall, 235 lbs, 30 years, good athletic background, can run several miles at a go, but not what I'd call in great shape.  I am certainly NOT one of those women whose reviews I read here on Amazon who complain that an exercise video spends TOO MUCH time demonstrating moves, and gives too much of a break between moves.  Nope!  I need things simple and paced so that I can actually do it.  So with that in mind, here's my review of Elise Gulan's Ballet Conditioning:Pros:1) Gorgeous Pacific background (someone's beautiful house)2) Gulan has an amazing figure and is very graceful - gives me something to which to aspire, and trying to imitate her grace took my mind off the difficulty of what I was doing - a tiny bit at least.3) I found the moves very difficult, and I was working hard let me tell you!4) For a complete ballet newbie, I guess there was a good element of introduction to ballet moves and terms.Cons:1) I was distracted by the fact that she kept on referring to long, lean dancer's muscles - but she's a beast.  Great figure, yes, very graceful movements, yes - but slender and delicate no.  Her thighs could not only crack walnuts - but could crack a walnut DESK! With a little self-tan and a tiny bikini, she could compete for body-building, I'm actually serious here.2) I have to say this - since I volunteered at a fire station I probably (unfortunately) know more about soft-core pron than most women... I am willing to swear blind that the production company mixing the music does mostly soft-core pron.  It was so disconcerting, and distracting - in the first section there was even the classic 70s pron ""bow-wow"" every now and then.  With that ocean background, contact-paper ""wood"" platform, and fake cultured voiceover - it really was set up like soft-core pron.3) Gulan's voiceover is freakin' annoying.  I know she's trying to sound soft, musical, warm, and classy - but it sounds unnatural and forced.  And she has a VERY weird, distracting habit of ""warming"" nearly every line (the only explanation I could find for the weirdness), so that it sounds like she's making a dirty innuendo; my mental image is of her constantly wiggling her eyebrows and winking creepily.  What the heck??  This really adds to the creepy soft-core pron feeling of this video.4) As to the actual exercise - the segment was too long, and impossible for anyone other than a dedicated gym-rat or ballerina to follow.  It was very discouraging to me.  She just never stops, and never gives you even a second's rest, and rather than switching muscles just sticks with the same ones, nonstop.  Yes I know I have a remote, but I think a good choreographer builds exercise programs in segments, and switches muscle groups.5) Her instructions tend to give important info a little too late to be helpful - not until the very end of the last leg of moves where she's casually lifting her leg to her ears (ok, I'm exaggerating) does she mention that it doesn't matter if you only lift it an inch, practice will increase flexibility, yada yada.  My pulled groin would have appreciated that little tidbit a bit earlier!  :)My verdict:If you really want to do ballet conditioning, and are willing to kill yourself every day until you can actually follow her moves, go for it.  If you want to have a reasonably paced, uplifting workout session, go elsewhere.  You'll end up discouraged and feeling inadequate, instead of proud of your hard work.  And maybe a little creeped out and dirty.Whereas I've put in Tracey Mallett every day, this is only the second time I've put in this DVD... and probably not too many more times.  Ebay here I come!*Edits from 4 years later: 1) From the comments, there was confusion - ""pron"" is my attempt to avoid auto spam sweepers. You know what I'm saying. :) And I'm not saying that this video is inappropriate, just that it has stylistic elements commonly found in softcore. 2) I just discovered that Sparkpeople.com has free sign-up and free segments of popular fitness videos, including ""Xtend Barre: Lean and Chiseled"" (which seems like what I was looking for in this video), Bollywood, Pilates, etc. I have no affiliation with Sparkpeople, except as a loyal user of their website.  3) Tracey Mallett still gets put into my DVD player on a regular basis... so I guess I should go do a review of that video too!",2,Not really for beginners,1223683200,"10 11, 2008",2008,4681,"[""'m"", 'trying', 'find', 'good', 'DVD', 'exercise', 'thought', ""'d"", 'try', 'ballet', 'hey', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'be',

I'm certainly glad I did - this is a great lower body workout that leaves you feeling energized at the end.  The workout is composed of about 30 minutes with the barre (using a chair), 5 minutes of jumping, 10 minutes of Pilates-like ab work and 5 minutes of stretching. I felt the muscles in my thighs working deeper than I have worked them before.  They were actually shaking throughout the abdominal portion!  Furthermore, holding your arms up nearly continuously is great for sculpting your shoulders.  By the time I finished this DVD, I felt like my posture was a little better!The instructor was pleasant, but the biggest downside to this workout is the cuing.  Being new to ballet, I can't follow instructions well without seeing the movement.  There are a few exercises where I had to stop, look at the screen, and rewind to the beginning of the movement.  I agree with some reviewers that not being as flexible as the instructor can be a bit frustrating.

1107848,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000WC38BO,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[8, 8]","I have done some ballet/barre workouts in the past, but being an intermediate-to-advanced level exerciser, I sometimes find these types of workouts to be too easy for me.  I am happy to report that Element Ballet Conditioning felt almost exactly right for my level.  Instructor Elise Gulan begins with an easy, 3-minute warm-up that consists of some very simple stretching moves such as reaching the arms overhead and standing forward bends.  She then asks you to step near your chair to begin the main workout.  Again, she starts off easy with relev&eacute;s; these feel fairly gentle to begin.  However, Gulan starts to pick up the intensity in the next segment, which includes both demi- and grand-pli&eacute;s using the chair; she also performs a series of pli&eacute;s without the chair.In series which follows, Gulan incorporates tendu, battement, and developp&eacute;, performed all on one side and then repeated on the following side.  She then does the same with rond de jambe, knee circles (I don't recall the ballet name for this one), and grand rond de jambe.  The final standing series includes simple leg lifts to the front, side, and back and then attitudes to the front and the back.  Throughout the standing work, Gulan keeps the arms working as well, usually by holding them in a port de bras position.  The standing toning concludes at about the 35-minute mark, and then Gulan leads you through approximately 4 minutes of brief cardio in the form of mini jumps.  These moves are basically little hops--for example, jumping in first position, second position, from first to second, and switching the feet back and forth in fifth position.  Gulan concludes the standing segment with some additional leg lifts while in standing splits, performing a seated twist (half Lord of the fishes pose from yoga) between each side.At this point, Gulan brings the session to the floor for approximately 5 minutes of intense, Pilates-inspired abs work.  Those familiar with Pilates will recognize moves such as the Pilates roll-up, single straight leg stretch (repeated twice), hip lifts, and single leg stretch.  In fact, because Gulan performs quite a high number of repetitions and offers little instruction, I would only recommend this segment to those who have prior experience with Pilates.  Gulan concludes the workout with approximately 4 minutes of stretching, performed mostly on the floor (butterfly stretch, wide-legged seated forward bend), although she does come to standing to finish, bringing in the total time for this workout at 49 minutes.Overall, I definitely felt like I got what I wanted from this DVD:  a nice, challenging lower body workout with a short but intense little abs segment to boot.  I don't think that you need to have previous dance or ballet experience to do this workout, but I don't think that it's designed for beginning exercisers, either; also, as mentioned above, I would recommend the abs section only to those with some prior familiarity with Pilates.  Based on these factors, I would recommend this workout, and my final rating is 4.5 stars.",5,Very good intermediate-level workout for the lower body,1256428800,"10 25, 2009",2009,3092,"['have', 'done', 'ballet/barre', 'workouts', 'past', 'being', 'intermediate-to-advanced', 'level', 'exerciser', 'sometimes', 'find', 'types', 'workouts', 'be', 'too', 'easy', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'Element', 'Ballet', 'Conditioning', 'felt', 'almost', 'exactly', 'right', 'level', 'Instructor', 'Elise', 'Gulan', 'easy', '3-minute', 'warm-up', 'very', 'simple', 'stretching', 'moves', 'such', 'reaching', 'arms', 'overhead', 'standing', 'forward', 'bends', 'then', 'step', 'chair', 'begin', 'main', 'workout', 'Again', 'easy', 'relev', 'eacute', 'feel', 'fairly', 'gentle', 'begin', 'However', 'Gulan', 'pick', 'up', 'intensity', 'next', 'segment', 'demi-', 'grand-pli', 'eacute', 'using', 'chair', 'also', 'series', 'pli', 'eacute', 'chair.In', 'series', 'Gulan', 'tendu', 'battement', 'developp', 'eacute', 'performed', 'one', 'side', 'then', 'repeated', 'following', 'side', 'then', 'same', 'rond', 'de', 'jambe', 'knee', 'circles', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ballet', 'name', 'one', 'grand', 'rond', 'jambe', 'final', 'standing', 'series', 'simple', 'leg', 'lifts', 'front', 'side', 'back', 'then', 'attitudes', 'front', 'back', 'standing', 'work', 'Gulan', 'arms', 'working', 'as', 'well', 'usually', 'holding', 'port', 'bras', 'position', 'standing', 'toning', 'concludes', '35-minute', 'mark', 'then', 'Gulan', 'approximately', '4', 'minutes', 'brief', 'cardio', 'form', 'mini', 'jumps', 'moves', 'are', 'basically', 'little', 'hops', 'example', 'jumping', 'first', 'position', 'second', 'position', 'first', 'second', 'switching', 'feet', 'back', 'forth', 'fifth', 'position', 'Gulan', 'standing', 'segment', 'additional', 'leg', 'lifts', 'standing', 'splits', 'performing', 'seated', 'twist', 'half', 'Lord', 'fishes', 'pose', 'yoga', 'side.At', 'point', 'Gulan', 'session', 'floor', 'approximately', '5', 'minutes', 'intense', 'Pilates-inspired', 'abs', 'work', 'familiar', 'Pilates', 'will', 'recognize', 'moves', 'such', 'Pilates', 'roll-up', 'single', 'straight', 'leg', 'stretch', 'repeated', 'twice', 'hip', 'lifts', 'single', 'leg', 'stretch', 'fact', 'Gulan', 'quite', 'high', 'number', 'repetitions', 'little', 'instruction', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'segment', 'who', 'have', 'prior', 'experience', 'Pilates', 'Gulan', 'workout', 'approximately', '4', 'minutes', 'stretching', 'performed', 'mostly', 'floor', 'butterfly', 'stretch', 'wide-legged', 'seated', 'forward', 'bend', 'come', 'standing', 'finish', 'bringing', 'total', 'time', 'workout', '49', 'minutes.Overall', 'definitely', 'felt', 'got', 'what', 'wanted', 'DVD', 'nice', 'challenging', 'lower', 'body', 'workout', 'short', 'intense', 'little', 'abs', 'segment', 'boot', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'need', 'have', 'previous', 'dance', 'ballet', 'experience', 'do', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'designed', 'beginning', 'exercisers', 'either', 'also', 'mentioned', 'would', 'recommend', 'abs', 'section', 'only', 'prior', 'familiarity', 'Pilates', 'Based', 'factors', 'would', 'recommend', 'workout', 'final', 'rating', '4.5', 'stars']",Element: Ballet Conditioning

Almost perfect because I could have used slightly more instruction throughout the workout. Even adding more instructions on how to stand in first position (Do you tuck your hips under? Should you turn your thighs in when in first position?) would be helpful, especially for those who have no prior training in ballet.Nonetheless, the workout overall is still excellent. The program is fun and goes by very quickly (about 50 minutes in total). You are taken through a series of ballet exercises that really challenge your flexibility and if performed correctly (hence, a little more instruction on stance and form would be helpful) should sculpt and define muscles. You definitely feel this happening. One thing I love about this workout is that you only need a chair for balance (unless you have a ballet barre at home) so it is very ""portable"" (in all senses of the word).One thing to note: this program is mainly focused on core and lower body (hence, the name of the video..ballet conditioning). There are technically no upper body exercises with the exception of keeping your arm in ballet-like poses for each series. After a while, your arm muscles will start to ache and feel like they are being worked out because gravity will be calling. Not that this is a bad thing but if you are looking for a workout that includes actual upper body exercises, this is not it.

1107862,A2ZAOT2HEBQOUW,B000WC38BO,Eva H.,"[2, 3]","Initially, I became interested in ballet workout after observing that many people in ballet classes in my local gym had beautifully toned arms. Their arms were defined and lean yet elegant and feminine - very different from the arms of weight lifters (think Madonna) or even these of experienced yoga instructors.The DVD offers one workout sequence, composed of the following subsections:-Warmup/ballet stretching-Lower body strengthening with ballet movements (plies, eleves, tendus, developes, leg lifts, attitudes)-Jumps (1st, 2nd, and 5th positions)-Abdominal work (non ballet workout on the floor such as scissoring of legs)-Cool down stretchYou may ask, ""where is the upper body workout""? Well, the beauty of the ballet exercise is that there is no need for a separate upper body section, because your arms are working very hard throughout the entire workout (except for the abdominal section), through port de bras, extending of the arms to the sides and overhead. This is a very effective and different way of toning your arms than lifting weights.Elise maintains a warm, encouraging tone throughout the workout, which does not intimidate a beginner but does not annoy a more advanced user, either. Her comment during the cool down summarizes the tone; ""if you can fold (forward) only few inches, that is beautiful. Because it is an honest expression of where you are today with your exercise"".If you are looking for a different and effective arms toner, try this DVD.

I thought this workout would be an easy, breezy workout that I'd get through with my eyes closed. So I popped in the DVD brought a chair over, my water and a towel. Elise came on and I noted she recommended no shoes. Great! I kicked off my sneakers and began the warm-up. Hmmm, thinking not too bad. I'm liking the relaxing scenery and calming music. Next thing you know I'm doing a million different kind of plies, my legs are screaming, I'm taking a break here and there and dripping with sweat all while Elise continues the workout with grace and a permanent smile. WHAT IN THE WORLD! All I can say is this workout is NO joke! The focus is primarily on the core and legs. The muscles in your legs are the largest in your body, therefore it takes way more energy doing a squat or plie versus a bicep curl or stomach crunch. Hence why my heart rate was so high right off the bat. Further you keep your arms in various ballet positions (i.e. rarely down) so you are engaging the upper body, lower body and the core all at once. After about 30 minutes or so of leg work utilizing a chair for balance, you move on to a series of various jumps, again my heart rate climbed. Finally you move to the floor for some ab work and then the cool down. I was absolutely amazed at how fit Elise is. To do this workout without breaking a sweat and keeping a smile on her face fascinated me as I was huffing and puffing and working on my balance and engaging my core and trying to lift my leg just THAT much higher. This is an awesome workout! Definitely think it's something to build into your workout routines atleast three times a week.

It also has a much better flow and is more fun to do than the NYC Ballet Workout (though these DVDs also have their own strengths as a ballet workout). Even though some may have thought Gulan's DVD workout is not ""traditional"" enough as a ballet workout, I can accept it for what it essentially is: a workout based on ballet movement. First and foremost, it is meant to be an exercise routine, and in this respect it succeeds sufficiently. I did break into a slow sweat (not heart-pounding cardio, but one is definitely burning calories and working the muscles of the legs intensely). It is a wonderful, relatively low-impact workout that makes one feel like one has actually worked out, but not to the extent as to make it impossible to walk a day afterwards. I like that the movements are not abrupt, jarring to the limbs, or involve vigorous momentum for their execution. For my purposes, this DVD workout does indeed serve its purpose. There may not be much of an upper-body workout involved, but most ballet doesn't actually involve a lot of upper-body work; it's all based on creating a lean upper-body over time via graceful poise and ""port-de-bras"". I can do yoga or Pilates for more upper body work, or even weight-lifting if I want (though I'd like to de-bulk my upper-body from years of weight-lifting instead of making my arms bigger). No twisting, pulling, or harsh positioning on the joints is involved, and so would suit those who have lower back or neck problems (though the Pilates core-strengthening in the end might be difficult for those who have weaker abdominal muscles).

The instructor, Elise Gulan, was a principal soloist for the Virginia Ballet Company and her experience shows as she so capably demonstrates the movements.  The cueing is done in voiceover.  The workout takes place in an exquisitely beautiful outdoor setting which adds to the lovely tranquility of the workout.  Elise starts out with graceful, flowing stretches before getting into the barre work.  Although it is helpful to have a barre, Ms. Gulan does all of the supported work with a chair.  After the barre work, which will really work your legs/glutes, she leads you through a series of kicks (battements) to the front, back and sides.  Next is jumps in first, second and fifth position.  This will also work your legs and raise your heartrate.  None of the jumps take up a lot of room.

Although you are supposed to be using your core muscles, I just didn't feel satisfied after the workout.

However, I live in an apartment so I don't like jumping around a lot and bugging my downstairs neighbors, so there were a few exercises I did halfway.

High production (see youtube clips for presentation), this workout is more about fitness/toning/losing weight then it is about dance. Music is light, but it does at least have a fast tempo to keep you from getting bored.Elise is only in voice over, sounds friendly & encouraging & she even uses a chair which she moves each time she switches sides. All her tips are only basic general terms about how to move, ballet name terms only, and vague to reminders to use your core muscles. She doesn't give any specific, or detailed instructions about how to turn out, avoid injury, etc. Anytime she talks that isn't about the above, she says ad nauseaum how a dancer's body is beautiful, how this workout will streamline your body, make you muscles stronger & help you lose weight. I took off a star for this annoyance, when she could be giving REAL tips.I enjoy how Elise never has you repeat anything on the same side twice to keep you from getting bored, but since she usually starts with her left (your right if mirroring), she definitely spends more time on that side so the workout isn't even on both sides & you may want to pause to switch a bit to even out.The workout itself maybe a slow pace, but it isn't for those who workout only rarely or have any lower joint, muscle issues or those who can't balance on one leg at long stretches. If you're looking for true ballet instruction, you won't find it here.Workout:2 min. trailer intro3 min. of very graceful stretching32 min of standing ballet work (occasional quick stretch here in there)3 min of soft jumping in 1st, 2nd & switching feet ballet positions2 min standing split & seated twist yoga pose break5 min of reclined pilates, (roll ups, A LOT of leg scissors, hip lifts)4 min cool down (butterfly, seated single wide leg stretch, seated wide leg side & fwd stretch) & ends w/graceful curtsy on both sides.I felt my legs burning during this & felt my abs working from reminding myself to use my abs (she doesn't remind), and using more wide open arm position w/keeping my elbows up to tone my arms/shoulders so I can feel this everywhere. The next day my quads were a little sore & I felt a nice separation between my pelvis & rib cage, w/the upper torso feeling more floaty on my spine & feeling the muscles of my abs/obliques much more how they really stabilize the body.clips at: totalfitnessdvds com, collagevideo com & youtube on channel atumasko under ""element ballet""",4,Rigorous ab/lower body workout using ballet movements,1246752000,"07 5, 2009",2009,2494,"['DVD', 'workout', 'only', 'basic', 'play/chapter', 'menu', 'choices', 'High', 'production', 'see', 'youtube', 'clips', 'presentation', 'workout', 'more', 'fitness/toning/losing', 'weight', 'then', 'dance', 'Music', 'light', 'least', 'have', 'fast', 'tempo', 'keep', 'getting', 'bored.Elise', 'only', 'voice', 'friendly', 'encouraging', 'even', 'chair', 'time', 'sides', 'tips', 'are', 'only', 'basic', 'general', 'terms', 'how', 'move', 'ballet', 'name', 'terms', 'only', 'vague', 'reminders', 'use', 'core', 'muscles', ""n't"", 'give', 'specific', 'detailed', 'instructions', 'how', 'turn', 'out', 'avoid', 'injury', 'etc', 'Anytime', ""n't"", 'above', 'ad', 'nauseaum', 'how', 'dancer', 'body', 'beautiful', 'how', 'workout', 'will', 'streamline', 'body', 'make', 'muscles', 'stronger', 'help', 'lose', 'weight', 'took', 'off', 'star', 'annoyance', 'when', 'could', 'be', 'giving', 'REAL', 'tips.I', 'enjoy', 'how', 'Elise', 'never', 'repeat', 'anything', 'same', 'side', 'twice', 'keep', 'getting', 'bored', 'usually', 'left', 'right', 'mirroring', 'definitely', 'more', 'time', 'side', 'workout', ""n't"", 'even', 'sides', 'may', 'want', 'pause', 'switch', 'bit', 'even', 'out.The', 'workout', 'maybe', 'slow', 'pace', ""n't"", 'who', 'workout', 'only', 'rarely', 'have', 'lower', 'joint', 'muscle', 'issues', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'balance', 'one', 'leg', 'long', 'stretches', ""'re"", 'looking', 'true', 'ballet', 'instruction', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here.Workout:2', 'min', 'trailer', 'intro3', 'min', 'very', 'graceful', 'stretching32', 'min', 'standing', 'ballet', 'work', 'occasional', 'quick', 'stretch', 'here', 'there', '3', 'min', 'soft', 'jumping', '1st', '2nd', 'switching', 'feet', 'ballet', 'positions2', 'min', 'standing', 'split', 'seated', 'twist', 'yoga', 'pose', 'break5', 'min', 'reclined', 'pilates', 'roll', 'ups', 'LOT', 'leg', 'scissors', 'hip', 'lifts', '4', 'min', 'cool', 'down', 'butterfly', 'seated', 'single', 'wide', 'leg', 'stretch', 'seated', 'wide', 'leg', 'side', 'fwd', 'stretch', 'w/graceful', 'curtsy', 'sides.I', 'felt', 'legs', 'burning', 'felt', 'abs', 'working', 'reminding', 'use', 'abs', ""n't"", 'remind', 'using', 'more', 'wide', 'open', 'arm', 'position', 'w/keeping', 'elbows', 'up', 'tone', 'arms/shoulders', 'can', 'feel', 'everywhere', 'next', 'day', 'quads', 'were', 'little', 'sore', 'felt', 'nice', 'separation', 'pelvis', 'rib', 'cage', 'w/the', 'upper', 'torso', 'feeling', 'more', 'floaty', 'spine', 'feeling', 'muscles', 'abs/obliques', 'much', 'more', 'how', 'really', 'stabilize', 'body.clips', 'totalfitnessdvds', 'com', 'collagevideo', 'com', 'youtube', 'channel', 'atumasko', 'element', 'ballet']",Element: Ballet Conditioning
