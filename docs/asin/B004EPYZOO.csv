Blu-ray 3D. I saw that the ratings were all over the place for all kinds of reasons.

If you are a ""wild and crazy guy"" (person)... you will give it a five star rating. OK, so your taking the time to read my rating. When I critique a movie on Amazon, I do so by looking at the big picture. After watching this film I saw that it was a ""shock and awe"" movie... held together with 3D. I am no prude, neither am I a blood and guts for blood and guts sake type of guy. I am somewhere in the middle. Although the movie came close at times to overdoing it, it had some ""smart"" shocking scenes. If I had seen this movie in 2D I would have said sure whatever. I watched it in 3D and expected it to be shoddily done. But no! I have new state of the art Samsung 3D equipment and low and behold the 3D was the ""icing on the cake"" for me.

On his way Milton meets Piper a woman who definitely is not your average damsel in distress and get her to help in him his quest. The rest of the movie is basically insane car chases, gunfights, car chases with gunfights, sex and a race against time to save the little girl, avoid the hellish bounty hunter who are sent to take Milton back to hell and find the devil worshiping could and lay waste to it. This movie is what you get if you take Ghost Rider but make it far more edgy and violent than Marvel would ever allow.I had allot of fun watching this movie. It is pure, mind nubbing action entertainment and nothing else, but sometimes a movie do not need to be more. The characters are all good. Milton is a typical Cage character, Piper is interesting, the leader of the devil worshiping cult is just such a jerk that you can not wait for him to get his just desert, and the Accountant, the man from hell sent to bring Milton back is mysterious and a hoot to watch. In short the characters work, you want the good guys to win and enjoy watching the bad guys get what they have coming. The special effects are all great and the car chases are inventive and fun to watch. I also loved the whole idea of hell as a prison with Satan as a warden, that is an interesting take on the whole concept of hell.If I am going to have one complaint about this movie it would have to be the sex, there is allot of it and it at times very graphic. Now I am not a prude but this is not really necessary, it do not give me anything when the movie suddenly decides to turn into a porno. Yes I know they where going for violent and gritty, but we know what they are doing and how it works so please get done with the sex and get back to the plot, a movie do not get more dark or more gritty just because it have allot of graphic sex.All in all Dive Angry is a decent film, is in mindless entertainment but it succeeds at that.

1398665,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B004EPYZOO,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 2]","DRIVE ANGRY (2011) is a hellish comic book-style movie (aimed at adolescent boys of all ages) that includes a netherworld ""hero"" named John Milton (get it?), lingering images of ghastly head wounds, totally nude women (one catfighting on the street has enormous...charms), overloud hip-hop and headbanger music, and a variety of classic muscle machines (Dodge Charger, Buick Rivera, Chevelle SS, etc.).At times an endless car chase on back country roads and at others a lame attempt to gross out the viewer with splooshing gun and axe wounds, the story goes from one indignity to the next at a rapid pace. Dumbest moment has to be several thugs breaking in on a scowling Nick Cage while he's copulating with an unclothed blonde. They engage in a motel room shootout as a contortionate Cage never allows his coitus to be interruptus. When the enemies are all dead, Cage's ""date"" is left cringing in the corner in a state of near-dementia. Hahaha.Upon reflection, a healthy touch of insanity (or masochism) is what's needed to sit through this thng.To briefly describe DRIVE ANGRY's non-linear plot: after the leader of a devil-worshipping cult decapitates Cage's daughter and mounts her femur on the upper end of his walking stick, he steals the dead girl's newborn daughter. Cage, who's rotting in Hades for unspecified sins, escapes with a multi-barreled god-zapping rifle and goes on a quest to avenge his daughter's murder and get back his grandchild.The Grim Reaper, in the form of an elegantly-suited ""Accountant,"" follows him to Earth and hunts down Cage and a young girl he's convinced to help with the rescue. Dozens of cars, a chemical truck and an RV are wrecked, explosions abound, and there's hamburger on the highway as bad music pounds like a migraine.

Generic gun shooting action that I've been seeing in abundance for the last 30 years.  It's actually pretty good.First of all *my God is Amber Heard amazingly attractive*.  I just HAD to get that off my chest!  What's more amazing is that she's the kind of woman who can radically change her appearance.  I've seen her in other movies and she looked like a very different woman.  She just has that ability to change the way she looks (and acts for that matter).Anyway, before my hormones got sidetracked, I was going to mention what the story is about.  It's about a man with apparent invincibility powers played by Nicolas Cage and he's chasing after satanic cult members.  He's also running from another man with similar super powers hence the Matrix style slow-motion bullet blasting segments that are actually used to good effect this time.  I can't say the same concerning ALL movies.The character of Amber Heard is that she's someone who actually has a filthy mouth so this is most certainly NOT a movie that children should be watching.  Way too many lines pertaining to sexual-related topics (especially in the beginning when we're first being introduced to the characters) and yeah, certainly not for kids.  Right from the beginning when she's working as a waitress in a diner you will quickly discover what she's like.  You won't like it.  She doesn't hold back *anything!*The violence and suspense is really exaggerated but I honestly wouldn't want it any other way.  Whenever Nicolas Cage is cornered with a loaded gun, he blasts the bad guys apart in really creative, hard to believe blood-splashing ways.  The guy following Nicolas Cage has the same knack for extreme violence.  Watch what happens when the two clash!  You just gotta love it!Overall, it's probably really cheesy but this is one of those examples where the cheesiness is overlooked because it features big name actors and actresses and the acting itself is really impressive and these features override the negatives by far.

1398687,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004EPYZOO,C. Sawin,"[49, 59]","Writer Todd Farmer and director Patrick Lussier really seemed to make the most of their partnership once they started working together. On their own, they brought us films like Jason X, Dracula 2000 and its sequels, and White Noise 2. Other than Jason X getting a pass from loyal horror and Friday the 13th fans, you don't really hear much about those other films. Drive Angry is technically only the second time Farmer and Lussier have collaborated with one another, but their first outing together was My Bloody Valentine which was actually a hell of a lot of fun. Not to mention the two horror buffs are currently attached to two projects that seem to have been in the works for ages; Halloween III and the Hellraiser reboot. So how would Drive Angry measure up to My Bloody Valentine? Would it be just as fun and would the 3D be utilized properly? How terrible would Nicolas Cage be? Turns out that if you're a fan of the previous work Farmer and Lussier have become associated with, you have nothing to worry about with Drive Angry.How is it that every character in the main cast is a total badass? It's because of that that it's hard to dislike anyone in the film including Nicolas Cage. Cage seems a little dull at first. When he mutters the line, ""Tell him...I'm comin'!"" it sounds a bit stiff and it isn't clear what type of performance Cage is going to give. Milton is actually Cage's most entertaining role since Big Daddy. He makes it seem so natural to be so angry while also being this unstoppable vigilante that just broke out of hell. Amber Heard's Piper comes off like she has a bigger pair of balls than any man she comes in contact with. She isn't afraid to go toe-to-toe with anyone and she usually comes out on top. William Fichtner may be the most entertaining part of the cast. He's been sent by the big man downstairs to retrieve Milton and bring him back to hell. His quick wit combined with the tricks he pulls off with that coin he carries around and his practically endless arsenal of superhuman abilities cause all eyes to be glued to him whenever he walks on screen. Then there's Billy Burke whose Jonah King character is a satanic cult leader convinced that he can't be harmed by anything from this earth. Jonah is such a despicable character that you're practically rooting for his character to bite it by the time his wicked plan is about to come to fruition.In addition to the film's cast, the writing is fairly entertaining as well. If you're familiar with anything Farmer or Lussier have done, you can pretty much expect events in the film to get a little outrageous or extremely outlandish at times. To tell the truth, that's half the charm of their films and what makes them so much fun. Does anyone else remember how people were saying that films like Crank or The Expendables were just kind of fun action films that you didn't have to think hard about? While that statement failed to register with me about those two films since I disliked both immensely, it fits extremely well with films by Farmer and Lussier except their films have a little more of a horror twist to them. The dialogue stood out at times, as well. There's a line Jonah spits out to Piper that went something like, ""I could shoot you in the throat right now and watch you gurgle while I eat my morning grapefruit..."" Some may consider that terrible, but the way Burke says it and the context it resides in really hit home with me. Cage also delivers a rather standout speech about how he had to watch his daughter suffer in hell while staring into a barrel of fire that is pretty memorable.The humor in the film slides into the storyline fairly smoothly. Everything from sarcastic one-liners to a rather obese man taking a picture of a naked woman lying on the sidewalk with his cell phone will be sure to get a fair amount of laughs. The coffee scene with Nicolas Cage is just really hilarious. All of that over black coffee and sugar. Todd Farmer's Frank may get the most laughs and audience reaction though, especially once Fichtner's The Accountant shows up. Drive Angry is just able to effectively blend action, comedy, and horror into this exceptionally entertaining film that engrosses your attention from beginning to end.Drive Angry is just ridiculous fun. It has an incredibly solid cast, an excessive amount of explosions and high octane car chases, and there's enough blood and T&A; to satisfy the most deprived R-rated film enthusiasts. The 3D deserves to be mentioned, as well. Having shotgun shells, severed limbs, various amounts of debris, and a countless amount of bullets practically fall into your lap should be a good enough reason to see this film in theaters. Drive Angry actually being an extremely satisfying and extraordinary action film is just a bonus.",4,Ridiculously fun and a hell of a ride,1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,4790,"['Writer', 'Todd', 'Farmer', 'director', 'Patrick', 'Lussier', 'really', 'seemed', 'make', 'most', 'partnership', 'started', 'working', 'together', 'own', 'brought', 'films', 'Jason', 'X', 'Dracula', '2000', 'sequels', 'White', 'Noise', '2', 'Other', 'Jason', 'X', 'getting', 'pass', 'loyal', 'horror', 'Friday', '13th', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'hear', 'much', 'other', 'films', 'Drive', 'Angry', 'technically', 'only', 'second', 'time', 'Farmer', 'Lussier', 'have', 'collaborated', 'one', 'first', 'outing', 'together', 'was', 'My', 'Bloody', 'Valentine', 'was', 'actually', 'hell', 'lot', 'fun', 'Not', 'mention', 'two', 'horror', 'buffs', 'are', 'currently', 'attached', 'two', 'projects', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'works', 'ages', 'Halloween', 'III', 'Hellraiser', 'reboot', 'how', 'would', 'Drive', 'Angry', 'measure', 'My', 'Bloody', 'Valentine', 'Would', 'be', 'just', 'fun', 'would', '3D', 'be', 'utilized', 'properly', 'How', 'terrible', 'would', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'be', 'out', ""'re"", 'fan', 'previous', 'work', 'Farmer', 'Lussier', 'have', 'become', 'associated', 'have', 'nothing', 'worry', 'Drive', 'Angry.How', 'character', 'main', 'cast', 'total', 'badass', 'hard', 'dislike', 'anyone', 'film', 'including', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Cage', 'little', 'dull', 'first', 'When', 'line', 'Tell', ""'m"", 'comin', 'bit', 'stiff', ""n't"", 'clear', 'what', 'type', 'performance', 'Cage', 'going', 'give', 'Milton', 'actually', 'Cage', 'most', 'entertaining', 'role', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'seem', 'so', 'natural', 'be', 'so', 'angry', 'also', 'being', 'unstoppable', 'vigilante', 'just', 'broke', 'hell', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'Piper', 'bigger', 'pair', 'balls', 'man', 'contact', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'go', 'toe-to-toe', 'anyone', 'usually', 'out', 'top', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'entertaining', 'part', 'cast', 'been', 'sent', 'big', 'man', 'retrieve', 'Milton', 'bring', 'back', 'hell', 'quick', 'wit', 'combined', 'tricks', 'coin', 'practically', 'endless', 'arsenal', 'superhuman', 'abilities', 'cause', 'eyes', 'be', 'glued', 'whenever', 'walks', 'screen', 'Then', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'Jonah', 'King', 'character', 'satanic', 'cult', 'leader', 'convinced', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'harmed', 'anything', 'earth', 'Jonah', 'such', 'despicable', 'character', ""'re"", 'practically', 'rooting', 'character', 'bite', 'time', 'wicked', 'plan', 'come', 'fruition.In', 'addition', 'film', 'cast', 'writing', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'anything', 'Farmer', 'Lussier', 'have', 'done', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'expect', 'events', 'film', 'get', 'little', 'outrageous', 'extremely', 'outlandish', 'times', 'tell', 'truth', 'charm', 'films', 'what', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'Does', 'anyone', 'else', 'remember', 'how', 'people', 'were', 'saying', 'films', 'Crank', 'Expendables', 'were', 'just', 'kind', 'fun', 'action', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'think', 'hard', 'statement', 'failed', 'register', 'two', 'films', 'disliked', 'immensely', 'extremely', 'well', 'films', 'Farmer', 'Lussier', 'films', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'horror', 'twist', 'dialogue', 'stood', 'out', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'line', 'Jonah', 'out', 'Piper', 'went', 'something', 'could', 'shoot', 'throat', 'right', 'now', 'watch', 'gurgle', 'eat', 'morning', 'grapefruit', 'may', 'consider', 'terrible', 'way', 'Burke', 'context', 'really', 'hit', 'home', 'Cage', 'also', 'rather', 'standout', 'speech', 'how', 'had', 'watch', 'daughter', 'suffer', 'hell', 'staring', 'barrel', 'fire', 'pretty', 'memorable.The', 'humor', 'film', 'storyline', 'fairly', 'smoothly', 'Everything', 'sarcastic', 'one-liners', 'rather', 'obese', 'man', 'taking', 'picture', 'naked', 'woman', 'lying', 'sidewalk', 'cell', 'phone', 'will', 'be', 'sure', 'get', 'fair', 'amount', 'laughs', 'coffee', 'scene', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'just', 'really', 'hilarious', 'black', 'coffee', 'sugar', 'Todd', 'Farmer', 'Frank', 'may', 'get', 'most', 'laughs', 'audience', 'reaction', 'especially', 'once', 'Fichtner', 'Accountant', 'up', 'Drive', 'Angry', 'just', 'able', 'effectively', 'blend', 'action', 'comedy', 'horror', 'exceptionally', 'entertaining', 'film', 'attention', 'beginning', 'end.Drive', 'Angry', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'fun', 'incredibly', 'solid', 'cast', 'excessive', 'amount', 'explosions', 'high', 'octane', 'car', 'chases', 'enough', 'blood', 'T', 'A', 'satisfy', 'most', 'deprived', 'R-rated', 'film', 'enthusiasts', '3D', 'deserves', 'be', 'mentioned', 'as', 'well', 'Having', 'shotgun', 'shells', 'severed', 'limbs', 'various', 'amounts', 'debris', 'countless', 'amount', 'bullets', 'practically', 'fall', 'lap', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'theaters', 'Drive', 'Angry', 'actually', 'being', 'extremely', 'satisfying', 'extraordinary', 'action', 'film', 'just', 'bonus']",N/A

Lussier jokingly refers to Drive Angry as his ""subtle, gentle road movie,"" and battles through a bad case of laryngitis, which makes it difficult at times to understand what he's trying to say. But he soldiers on with Farmer as they talk about how the film was made. The two men tell all kinds of filming anecdotes as they talk us through filming. Lussier points out that Clint Eastwood's protagonist inHigh Plains Drifterwas the model for Nicolas Cage's character. They give shout-outs to various crew members' contributions on this solid track.""How To: Drive Angry"" is one of the better promotional featurettes. Amazingly, the studio gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do a hard R-rated supernatural action film. They talk about shooting in 3D as opposed to converting it in post-production. The filmmakers also talk about working with a modest budget and solving certain problems creatively as opposed to throwing a lot of money at it a la Michael Bay. It's nice to see that many of the stunts in the film were done practically.""Milton's Mayhem"" is an amusing extra that compiles all of Milton's action sequences and attributes a point system to every punch and gunshot like something out of a video game.Finally, there are two deleted scenes with optional commentary by Lussier and Farmer.

If you attend this movie, rent it, or watch it on late night T.V. do not expect a high brow film filled with human irony, Academy or Film Fest caliber acting or an ingenious plot with a star filled cast.  No, this film is simply silly fun which at times boarders on the tasteless.  It is the kind of movie you watch ""just because.""  The plot is quite simple.  Nicholas Cage plays...well, he sort of plays Nicholas Gage as a hardened and really, really bad guy who is dead but somehow escapes from Hell and steals a ""God Killer,"" which is a special gun capable of killing just about everything.  His mission is to stop and kill a crazed cult leader who has murdered his daughter and taken his grandchild in order to sacrifice the baby to meet his evil ends. He is tring to save his grand-daughter.  The `Accountant"" has been sent to bring him back.Folks, from beginning to end there is almost not stop gratuitous and graphic violence; some shot well, others not so well. There is also almost nonstop car chases using very pretty classic muscle cars (Think Dukes of Hazard on steroids) which should fulfill the fantasy needs of the little Bubba in all of us.  There are a couple of rather vivid and remarkable sex scenes - one of which I have never seen the like before...Cage engages in a gun/saw/shovel/sledge hammer fight with about 6 or 8 guys all while having quite graphic and nonstop  sex while at the same time smoking a cigar and drinking from a bottle of whiskey.  You know, you just don't see all that many scenes like that these days.I lost track of the body count in this film rather early on.  I lost track of how many ways Cage is able to kill off bad guys.  It was rather amazing.The acting jobs; performances if you will, turned in by the entire cast were marginal at best with Cage included.  This film was not his shinning moment in front of the camera.  This is okay though, I really don't see how he could have done it any other way.  But as with everything, there are exceptions.  The actor William Fichtner (one of my favorite character actors) did a pretty darn good job as The Accountant.  He is Satan's minion sent back to haul Cage back.  He played his part with class and was the one person that added humor to the movie; twisted and quirky humor, I admit, but never-the-less humor.  Amber Heard did an acceptable job as the girl friend and is most certainly easy on the eyes.  The rest...well, to put it mildly....I have seen better.  Now keep in mind that unlike many, I am rather fond of Cage...I have liked most of his movies on one level or another.Spoiler Alert:There were a few scenes in this work that sort of stood out.  One was Cage drinking beer from the skull of the freshly killed bad guy.  I thought that added a perfect touch.  Of course there was the gun battle scene where Cage is ""making love"" while killing off quite a number of bubba-boy bad guys and never stopping once.  There is the scene where Amber beats up her abusive boy friend in a fist fight which Cage eventually finishes for her and there are a number of scenes featuring The Accountant which will give even the most jaded viewer at least a smirk or two.Now don't let anyone feed you the line that the only reason they watched this movie was for the artistic and intellectual value involved.  Folks, there is none.  To make that claim is like the 18 year old telling you that the only reason he reads P. Boy magazine is so that he can read the intellectual articles.No, every so often a person (anyway, I do) likes to watch show filled with mindless violence, improbably chase and fighting scenes and a hokey plot.  You really don't have to think while watching this one...only enjoy the mass destruction.Note:  This is probably not the best first date movie a guy should choose and is not a movie you would want to take the wife, kids and grandma to see.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",4,DON'T GET SERIOUS ABOUT THIS ONE AND JUST ENJOY IT FOR WHAT IT IS...Great body count in this one folks.,1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,3960,"['movies', 'are', 'suppose', 'be', 'taken', 'serious', 'not', 'one', 'attend', 'movie', 'rent', 'watch', 'late', 'night', 'T.V', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'high', 'brow', 'film', 'filled', 'human', 'irony', 'Academy', 'Film', 'Fest', 'caliber', 'acting', 'ingenious', 'plot', 'star', 'filled', 'cast', 'No', 'film', 'simply', 'silly', 'fun', 'times', 'boarders', 'tasteless', 'kind', 'movie', 'watch', 'just', 'plot', 'quite', 'simple', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'plays', 'well', 'sort', 'plays', 'Nicholas', 'Gage', 'hardened', 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'dead', 'somehow', 'escapes', 'Hell', 'God', 'Killer', 'special', 'gun', 'capable', 'killing', 'just', 'everything', 'mission', 'stop', 'kill', 'crazed', 'cult', 'leader', 'who', 'murdered', 'daughter', 'taken', 'grandchild', 'order', 'sacrifice', 'baby', 'meet', 'evil', 'ends', 'tring', 'save', 'grand-daughter', 'Accountant', 'been', 'sent', 'bring', 'back.Folks', 'beginning', 'end', 'almost', 'not', 'stop', 'gratuitous', 'graphic', 'violence', 'shot', 'well', 'others', 'not', 'so', 'well', 'also', 'almost', 'nonstop', 'car', 'chases', 'using', 'very', 'pretty', 'classic', 'muscle', 'cars', 'Think', 'Dukes', 'Hazard', 'steroids', 'should', 'fulfill', 'fantasy', 'needs', 'little', 'Bubba', 'are', 'couple', 'rather', 'vivid', 'remarkable', 'sex', 'scenes', 'one', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'like', 'Cage', 'gun/saw/shovel/sledge', 'hammer', 'fight', 'about', '6', '8', 'guys', 'having', 'quite', 'graphic', 'nonstop', 'sex', 'same', 'time', 'smoking', 'cigar', 'drinking', 'bottle', 'whiskey', 'know', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'many', 'scenes', 'days.I', 'lost', 'track', 'body', 'count', 'film', 'rather', 'early', 'lost', 'track', 'how', 'many', 'ways', 'Cage', 'able', 'kill', 'off', 'bad', 'guys', 'was', 'rather', 'amazing.The', 'acting', 'jobs', 'performances', 'will', 'turned', 'entire', 'cast', 'were', 'marginal', 'best', 'Cage', 'included', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'shinning', 'moment', 'front', 'camera', 'okay', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'other', 'way', 'everything', 'are', 'exceptions', 'actor', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'one', 'favorite', 'character', 'actors', 'did', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'job', 'Accountant', 'Satan', 'minion', 'sent', 'back', 'haul', 'Cage', 'back', 'played', 'part', 'class', 'was', 'one', 'person', 'added', 'humor', 'movie', 'twisted', 'quirky', 'humor', 'admit', 'never-the-less', 'humor', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'did', 'acceptable', 'job', 'girl', 'friend', 'most', 'certainly', 'easy', 'eyes', 'rest', 'well', 'put', 'mildly', '.I', 'have', 'seen', 'better', 'Now', 'keep', 'mind', 'many', 'am', 'rather', 'fond', 'Cage', 'have', 'liked', 'most', 'movies', 'one', 'level', 'another.Spoiler', 'Alert', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'work', 'sort', 'stood', 'One', 'was', 'Cage', 'drinking', 'beer', 'skull', 'freshly', 'killed', 'bad', 'guy', 'thought', 'added', 'perfect', 'touch', 'course', 'was', 'gun', 'battle', 'scene', 'where', 'Cage', 'making', 'love', 'killing', 'off', 'quite', 'number', 'bubba-boy', 'bad', 'guys', 'never', 'stopping', 'once', 'scene', 'where', 'Amber', 'up', 'abusive', 'boy', 'friend', 'fist', 'fight', 'Cage', 'eventually', 'are', 'number', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'Accountant', 'will', 'give', 'even', 'most', 'jaded', 'viewer', 'least', 'smirk', 'two.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'feed', 'line', 'only', 'reason', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'artistic', 'intellectual', 'value', 'involved', 'Folks', 'none', 'make', 'claim', '18', 'year', 'old', 'telling', 'only', 'reason', 'P.', 'Boy', 'magazine', 'so', 'can', 'read', 'intellectual', 'articles.No', 'so', 'often', 'person', 'anyway', 'do', 'watch', 'show', 'filled', 'mindless', 'violence', 'improbably', 'chase', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'hokey', 'plot', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'think', 'watching', 'one', 'only', 'enjoy', 'mass', 'destruction.Note', 'probably', 'not', 'best', 'first', 'date', 'movie', 'guy', 'should', 'choose', 'not', 'movie', 'would', 'want', 'take', 'wife', 'kids', 'grandma', 'see.Don', 'BlankenshipThe', 'Ozarks']",N/A

I haven't been nice to Nicolas Cage for quite a while because, face it, his movies have just been plain awful.  And then, I happened across this one.  Boy, did I have a good time!!""Drive Angry"" is about an already dead bad guy Milton (Cage), who breaks out of hell in order to save his infant granddaughter from an over-the-top bunch of Satan worshippers.  Along the way, Cage is pursued by Hell's Accountant (wonderfully underplayed by William Fichtner) and the minions of devil worshippers--all mind controlled by Johah King (played by Willy Burke).  Milton manages to pick up a s***-kicker in Piper (in another tremendous performance), who eventually becomes his sidekick.  There are shoot-outs and shoot-ups galore along the way, lots of car chases/crashes, a little sex, and everything comes to its magnificant climax in the middle of nowhere.This movie is pure, out-and-out FUN (with a capital ""F"")!  It's mindless, senseless, better-than-average B entertainment.  None of the characters take themselves seriously (which is very unusual for a Nick Cage movie), it's all played tongue-in-cheek, and, well, I don't think I've had this much fun in a long, long time!!Directed by Patrick Lussier, ""Drive Angry"" is rated R for violence and language and runs 104 minutes.

Without all the noisy distractions, the story is surprisingly basic, I've actually seen similar: good and bad.  The plot: a crazy cult leader kills the daughter of Milton (Nicolas Cage), kidnaps his infant granddaughter, AND plans to sacrifice the baby to herald in a new world order.  Seen it.  What makes this one a tad different is Milton is already dead and has to escape from hell in order to rescue his granddaughter.  Mayhem ensues, on a grand scale; it doesn't help that Nicolas also has to evade The Accountant (William Fichtner), sent by you-know-who, to capture and send Milton back to hell.  It's actually just a real long chase movie, a case of follow the crazy leader.  There are no real surprises along the way, a few shocks, a few bumps in the road, but nothing truly awe inspiring.  If you've seen one explosion.....really, there's only so much you can do with fire.  If you stripped the movie of all the garish violence, blood, and noise there'd be little left but a story that can be summed up in one sentence.  In other words, when things aren't exploding or people getting shot or run over, it's pretty dull: ordinary, sad, and not a little limp.  Cage obviously did it for the money and I hope he got paid up front because this was a huge box office bomb, not even the take from foreign markets could help recoup the cost.  (So don't expect a sequel.)However, I did like some of it.  I was pleasantly surprised by William Fichtner's performance (usually a one note actor known for playing the same bad guy, repeatedly).  I thought he was hysterical.  Amber Heard was also good as Piper, someone Milton picks up along the way.  And it's always nice to see Tom Atkins in anything.  As for Nicolas Cage, it's hard to tell whether he purposely made Milton so low-key that he appeared comatose at times, or, dead, or he just wasn't trying because he felt the material was beneath him.

All I did know was that there were American muscle cars being driven fast and some shooting between cars going on, and since I was in the mood to be entertained, I just settled in and watched the movie.What did I get?  One heck of a great time!  Okay, this flick earned it's R rating because there was plenty of foul language, nudity and gore, but I'm a big girl and I knew what I was expecting going in.What I didn't expect was to laugh as much as I did, because while this movie was raunchy entertainment, it was also alot of fun.Our angry driver, Milton, escapes from Hell when his daughter is murdered and his newborn granddaughter is kidnapped and slated for satanic sacrifice by the true villain in this movie.Milton escaped from Hell with a very special weapon called 'the god killer' and he's determined to use it on anyone who gets between him and saving his granddaughter.  While he is trying to hunt down the jackhole who murdered his daughter and stole his granddaughter, he crosses paths with a waitress in a diner, Piper, who drives a fine car with a vanity plate that says DRVAGRY.Now, Piper can talk trash and kick butt, a take care of herself at any cost kind of girl, the sort that are few and far between in most movies where the chicks are supposed to shed their clothes frequently and wait for the hero to rescue them at ever turn.Not so for our Piper, who catches her boyfriend poppin' some other hoochie after having quit her gig at the greasy spoon where Milton runs into her.  After her engine conveniently craps out on the road so that Milton can help her out and beg a ride, he intervenes when Piper gets into it with her cheating old man after she lays fists on the chick her old man was bouncing on the mattress with.  Milton teaches him a few things about hitting women, even though Piper landed the first couple of punches, and they hit the road.Hot on their heels is The Accountant, who is hilariously funny throughout the movie for his deadpan character and the way he manages to intervene on Milton's behalf while still trying to take him down and return him to Hell so that his 'balance sheet' is returned to normal.There's brawling, F-bombs and lots of driving action that keeps this movie ripping along, and underneath all the in your face action there is a theme and some moments of poignancy that made this a far more well rounded entertainment experience than I ever expected going in.This was a great movie for pure entertainment and diversion, with action, laughter and some basic truths about right, wrong and how it all works out in the end to balance out.I had to say that in honor of The Accountant... ;)D",5,""" Even in hell there's compassion...""",1321401600,"11 16, 2011",2011,2735,"['had', 'absolutely', 'idea', 'what', 'story', 'line', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'when', 'got', 'did', 'know', 'was', 'were', 'American', 'muscle', 'cars', 'being', 'driven', 'fast', 'shooting', 'cars', 'going', 'was', 'mood', 'be', 'entertained', 'just', 'settled', 'watched', 'movie.What', 'did', 'get', 'One', 'heck', 'great', 'time', 'Okay', 'flick', 'earned', 'R', 'rating', 'was', 'plenty', 'foul', 'language', 'nudity', 'gore', ""'m"", 'big', 'girl', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'going', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'was', 'laugh', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'movie', 'was', 'raunchy', 'entertainment', 'was', 'also', 'alot', 'fun.Our', 'angry', 'driver', 'Milton', 'Hell', 'when', 'daughter', 'murdered', 'newborn', 'granddaughter', 'kidnapped', 'slated', 'satanic', 'sacrifice', 'true', 'villain', 'movie.Milton', 'escaped', 'Hell', 'very', 'special', 'weapon', 'called', ""'the"", 'god', 'killer', 'determined', 'use', 'anyone', 'who', 'saving', 'granddaughter', 'trying', 'hunt', 'down', 'jackhole', 'who', 'murdered', 'daughter', 'stole', 'granddaughter', 'paths', 'waitress', 'diner', 'Piper', 'who', 'fine', 'car', 'vanity', 'plate', 'DRVAGRY.Now', 'Piper', 'can', 'talk', 'trash', 'kick', 'butt', 'take', 'care', 'herself', 'cost', 'kind', 'girl', 'sort', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'most', 'movies', 'where', 'chicks', 'are', 'supposed', 'shed', 'clothes', 'frequently', 'wait', 'hero', 'rescue', 'ever', 'turn.Not', 'so', 'Piper', 'who', 'boyfriend', 'poppin', 'other', 'hoochie', 'having', 'quit', 'gig', 'greasy', 'spoon', 'where', 'Milton', 'engine', 'conveniently', 'out', 'road', 'Milton', 'can', 'help', 'out', 'beg', 'ride', 'when', 'Piper', 'cheating', 'old', 'man', 'fists', 'chick', 'old', 'man', 'was', 'bouncing', 'mattress', 'Milton', 'few', 'things', 'hitting', 'women', 'even', 'Piper', 'landed', 'first', 'couple', 'punches', 'hit', 'road.Hot', 'heels', 'Accountant', 'who', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'movie', 'deadpan', 'character', 'way', 'intervene', 'Milton', 'behalf', 'still', 'trying', 'take', 'down', 'return', 'Hell', 'so', ""'balance"", 'sheet', 'returned', 'brawling', 'F-bombs', 'lots', 'driving', 'action', 'movie', 'ripping', 'along', 'face', 'action', 'theme', 'moments', 'poignancy', 'made', 'far', 'more', 'well', 'rounded', 'entertainment', 'experience', 'ever', 'expected', 'going', 'in.This', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'diversion', 'action', 'laughter', 'basic', 'truths', 'right', 'wrong', 'how', 'out', 'end', 'balance', 'out.I', 'had', 'say', 'honor', 'Accountant', 'D']",N/A

1398709,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B004EPYZOO,Graves,"[2, 4]","Nick Cage is an amazing actor. The problem is that he has a talent for picking films that are either amazingly good or completely forgettable. Drive Angry is one of the latter.The plot is pretty straight forward. Cage plays a mysterious wander with weirdly strange weapons, who is trying to hunt down a cult leader who murdered his daughter and plans to sacrifice his grand daughter in a Satanic ritual. Along the way he picks up Amber Herd, a disgruntled waitress who's just dumped her abusive fianc&eacute;e and off they go. Besides Cage chasing after the Satanists, a lethal character calling himself `the accountant' is chasing after Cage and the accountant is clearly more than human. Maybe he's even death himself. It is pretty clear that all the players know each other and there are a lot of balls in the air.The problem is you don't care about any of them. The Satanists are scummy but other than that, there's little redeeming about Cage and ""The Accountant"" comes off as almost likeable, almost. You're not sure which way is up but  with no one particularly likeable you don't know who to cheer for and you don't particularly care what happens. The 3d effects exist solely for gore effect in some fight scenes and otherwise tend to make the production values look cheesey..Amber Heard is along for plot exposition as Cage explains to her what is going on. The actress said she was in the film to spend most of the time in short shorts and I will confess I had my concerns that her acting ability would be inversely proportional to her considerable eye candy factor. Wonderfully and the high point of the film Ms. Heard's acting ability is good enough that she holds her own with Nick Cage and is believable.I got tired of this long before the credits roll. Cage is at his usual best a the very intense, very weird, somewhat scraggly guy. Amber Heard's acting is strong enough that she makes a good impression while surrounded by the rest of the film which is so poorly done- quick look at gore and don't notice the lack of a plot- that you just don't care. You might enjoy the fight scenes, Cage being mysterious and grumpy and Heard being lovely, but you really won't care a lick about them when the DVD goes back in the box.",2,Ah....No.,1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,2237,"['Nick', 'Cage', 'amazing', 'actor', 'problem', 'talent', 'picking', 'films', 'are', 'either', 'amazingly', 'good', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'Drive', 'Angry', 'one', 'latter.The', 'plot', 'pretty', 'straight', 'forward', 'Cage', 'mysterious', 'wander', 'weirdly', 'strange', 'weapons', 'who', 'trying', 'hunt', 'down', 'cult', 'leader', 'who', 'murdered', 'daughter', 'plans', 'sacrifice', 'grand', 'daughter', 'Satanic', 'ritual', 'way', 'up', 'Amber', 'Herd', 'disgruntled', 'waitress', 'who', 'just', 'dumped', 'abusive', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'go', 'Besides', 'Cage', 'chasing', 'Satanists', 'lethal', 'character', 'calling', 'accountant', 'chasing', 'Cage', 'accountant', 'clearly', 'more', 'human', 'Maybe', 'even', 'death', 'pretty', 'clear', 'players', 'know', 'other', 'are', 'lot', 'balls', 'air.The', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Satanists', 'are', 'scummy', 'other', 'little', 'redeeming', 'Cage', 'Accountant', 'off', 'almost', 'likeable', 'almost', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'way', 'up', 'one', 'particularly', 'likeable', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'cheer', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'what', '3d', 'effects', 'exist', 'solely', 'gore', 'effect', 'fight', 'scenes', 'otherwise', 'tend', 'make', 'production', 'values', 'look', 'cheesey..Amber', 'Heard', 'along', 'plot', 'exposition', 'Cage', 'what', 'going', 'actress', 'said', 'was', 'film', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'short', 'shorts', 'will', 'confess', 'had', 'concerns', 'acting', 'ability', 'would', 'be', 'inversely', 'proportional', 'considerable', 'eye', 'candy', 'factor', 'Wonderfully', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'Ms.', 'Heard', 'acting', 'ability', 'good', 'enough', 'own', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'believable.I', 'got', 'tired', 'long', 'credits', 'roll', 'Cage', 'usual', 'best', 'very', 'intense', 'very', 'weird', 'somewhat', 'scraggly', 'guy', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'acting', 'strong', 'enough', 'good', 'impression', 'surrounded', 'rest', 'film', 'so', 'poorly', 'done-', 'quick', 'look', 'gore', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'lack', 'plot-', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'might', 'enjoy', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Cage', 'being', 'mysterious', 'grumpy', 'Heard', 'being', 'lovely', 'really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'lick', 'when', 'DVD', 'back', 'box']",N/A

1398715,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004EPYZOO,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 3]","Thank goodness Nicolas Cage has gotten his la-de-dah ADAPTATION / LEAVING LAS VEGAS phase out of the way, because now he can really focus on firming up his acting legacy by way of starring in as many cheesy action movies as humanly possible. Look out, Michael Dudikoff.Except that DRIVE ANGRY's outlandish premise is sure-fire bait for cats like me. Nicolas Cage plays ""John Milton"" - and how many of you caught that bit of literature? - an undead fugitive what broke out of Hell to avenge his daughter's murder and to save his captive baby grand-child from a Satanic cult. Milton tears thru mythical places such as Laughter, Colorado and Still Water Marsh, Louisiana and, uh, Oklahoma, as he relentlessly tracks the demented cult leader Jonah King (Billy Burke). Along the way Milton gains the help of the lovely, two-fisted waitress Piper (Amber Heard), and there they go, tearing off in Piper's wicked 1969 Dodge Charger 440, hellbent for justice, B-movie grindhouse style. But Milton and Piper are racing against the clock. Once the full moon hovers high, Milton's grand-child will be sacrificed in a demonic ritual intended to bring about - and this can only be said in caps - THE END OF THE WORLD (world world world...).Meantime, the demonic Accountant (William Fichtner, all unflappable), the Devil's top repo agent, has been deployed to retrieve Milton, drag the taciturn sucker back to Tartarus, preferably kicking and screaming. The Accountant, with his quirks and that insouciant gleam in his eye, is instantly my favorite character in this film. Nicolas Cage would've done well to have generated a like gleam in his eye. He settles for a bullet hole in the eyeball. Not the same.Thru all the over-the-top splatterfest and the gratuitous nudity and the rampant f-bombs you can almost feel director Patrick Lussier blatantly not apologizing. He set out to make a riproaring, wildly violent grindhouse flick and damnation if he didn't get away with it. Somewhere, Quentin Tarantino just stained his pants. DRIVE ANGRY is essentially one long chase scene which occasionally detours into Shootemupville and Boobytown. Amber Heard instantly makes an impression, with her hot bod and take-no-guff-from-anyone attitude. Nicolas Cage plays it cool but detached which is de rigueur for Cage when starring in most of his action flicks. But a Nick Cage who's sold out is still pretty watchable. No one else can quite be as indifferently cool. DRIVE ANGRY wrests four stars out of five from me, based some on Cage's effort, some on Fichtner's attention grabbing performance, and on Amber Heard's fight, and on the film's excesses and nutty attitude and sheer chutzpah. This is a fun movie. But, then again, I'm the kinda guy who'd rather watch DRIVE ANGRY over LEAVING LAS VEGAS any day, any time. DRIVE ANGRY doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is: a slice of awesome supernatural action-packed B-movie shlock with nice bits of nudity.The DVD's bonus stuff: Audio Commentary by director/co-writer Patrick Lussier and co-writer Todd Farmer; ""How to: DRIVE ANGRY"" - the Making Of the Film (00:18:16 minutes long); ""Milton's Mayhem"" - as we revisit scenes featuring Milton inflicting bodily damage on various scumbags, a score board appears onscreen which grades his acts of violence (there may also be style points alloted) (00:09:27 minutes); and 2 Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:01:33 minutes).",4,I went to Hell and all I got was this lousy toupee,1312502400,"08 5, 2011",2011,3398,"['Thank', 'goodness', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'gotten', 'la-de-dah', 'ADAPTATION', '/', 'LEAVING', 'LAS', 'VEGAS', 'phase', 'way', 'because', 'now', 'can', 'really', 'focus', 'firming', 'up', 'acting', 'legacy', 'way', 'starring', 'as', 'many', 'cheesy', 'action', 'movies', 'humanly', 'possible', 'Look', 'out', 'Michael', 'Dudikoff.Except', 'DRIVE', 'ANGRY', 'outlandish', 'premise', 'sure-fire', 'bait', 'cats', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'John', 'Milton', 'how', 'many', 'caught', 'bit', 'literature', 'undead', 'fugitive', 'what', 'broke', 'Hell', 'avenge', 'daughter', 'murder', 'save', 'captive', 'baby', 'grand-child', 'Satanic', 'cult', 'Milton', 'thru', 'mythical', 'places', 'such', 'Laughter', 'Colorado', 'Still', 'Water', 'Marsh', 'Louisiana', 'uh', 'Oklahoma', 'relentlessly', 'demented', 'cult', 'leader', 'Jonah', 'King', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'way', 'Milton', 'gains', 'help', 'lovely', 'two-fisted', 'waitress', 'Piper', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'there', 'go', 'tearing', 'off', 'Piper', 'wicked', '1969', 'Dodge', 'Charger', '440', 'hellbent', 'justice', 'B-movie', 'grindhouse', 'style', 'Milton', 'Piper', 'are', 'racing', 'clock', 'full', 'moon', 'hovers', 'high', 'Milton', 'grand-child', 'will', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'demonic', 'ritual', 'intended', 'bring', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'said', 'caps', 'END', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'world', 'world', 'world', '.Meantime', 'demonic', 'Accountant', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'unflappable', 'Devil', 'top', 'repo', 'agent', 'been', 'deployed', 'retrieve', 'Milton', 'drag', 'taciturn', 'sucker', 'back', 'Tartarus', 'preferably', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'Accountant', 'quirks', 'insouciant', 'gleam', 'eye', 'instantly', 'favorite', 'character', 'film', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'would', ""'ve"", 'done', 'well', 'have', 'generated', 'like', 'gleam', 'eye', 'bullet', 'hole', 'eyeball', 'Not', 'same.Thru', 'over-the-top', 'splatterfest', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'rampant', 'f-bombs', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'director', 'Patrick', 'Lussier', 'blatantly', 'not', 'apologizing', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'riproaring', 'wildly', 'violent', 'grindhouse', 'flick', 'damnation', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'Somewhere', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'just', 'stained', 'pants', 'DRIVE', 'ANGRY', 'essentially', 'one', 'long', 'chase', 'scene', 'occasionally', 'Shootemupville', 'Boobytown', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'instantly', 'impression', 'hot', 'bod', 'take-no-guff-from-anyone', 'attitude', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'cool', 'detached', 'de', 'rigueur', 'Cage', 'when', 'starring', 'most', 'action', 'flicks', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'who', 'sold', 'out', 'still', 'pretty', 'watchable', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'quite', 'be', 'indifferently', 'cool', 'DRIVE', 'ANGRY', 'four', 'stars', 'five', 'based', 'Cage', 'effort', 'Fichtner', 'attention', 'grabbing', 'performance', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'fight', 'film', 'excesses', 'nutty', 'attitude', 'sheer', 'chutzpah', 'fun', 'movie', 'then', 'again', ""'m"", 'kinda', 'guy', 'who', 'rather', 'watch', 'DRIVE', 'ANGRY', 'LEAVING', 'LAS', 'VEGAS', 'day', 'time', 'DRIVE', 'ANGRY', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'anything', 'what', 'slice', 'awesome', 'supernatural', 'action-packed', 'B-movie', 'shlock', 'nice', 'bits', 'nudity.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'director/co-writer', 'Patrick', 'Lussier', 'co-writer', 'Todd', 'Farmer', 'How', 'DRIVE', 'ANGRY', 'Making', 'Film', '00:18:16', 'minutes', 'long', 'Milton', 'Mayhem', 'revisit', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'Milton', 'inflicting', 'bodily', 'damage', 'various', 'scumbags', 'score', 'board', 'acts', 'violence', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'style', 'points', 'alloted', '00:09:27', 'minutes', '2', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'totaling', '00:01:33', 'minutes']",N/A

While it won't win any awards, the film is a fun romp for B movie fans, especially with regards to Nicholas Cage and William Fichtner.

1398722,A2BFPQT4UQ9DKI,B004EPYZOO,Jason C. Ditz,"[0, 0]","Drive Angry is the least successful 3D movie of all time as of its creation, and its gimmicky special effects combined with a puzzling narrative are the reasons why. The movie opens with Nicolas Cage escaping from Hell in a souped up car, with no explanation as to where he got the car. He emerges pretty much instantly into a gun battle in Colorado, because why not.The movie is set in a universe that seems to have an impressively rich backstory, with a bureaucratic Hell with super-powered accountants and &#34;God guns,&#34; but it is a backstory that we are left in the dark about almost entirely. It's written like something based on a deep source material, like how a Star Wars movie assumes the audience knows a lot about jedi, lightsabers, etc, but the source material in Drive Angry doesn't actually exist anywhere outside of the movie itself.While this makes the storyline in between the straight-forward (but 3d gimmick-heavy) action scenes incomprehensible at times, it also makes the movie very re-watchable, if only to try to puzzle out what exactly was going on. Between that, the spectacle of Nick Cage getting into a drunken, mid-sex gun fight with a bunch of marauders, and William Fichtner's almost impossibly cool portrayal of The Accountant, the movie is definitely worth seeing. The end also hints at a sequel, which sadly because of the movie's disastrous performance will undoubtedly never happen.",4,Hilariously Bad,1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,1422,"['Drive', 'Angry', 'least', 'successful', '3D', 'movie', 'time', 'creation', 'gimmicky', 'special', 'effects', 'combined', 'puzzling', 'narrative', 'are', 'reasons', 'why', 'movie', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'escaping', 'Hell', 'souped', 'up', 'car', 'explanation', 'where', 'got', 'car', 'pretty', 'much', 'instantly', 'gun', 'battle', 'Colorado', 'why', 'not.The', 'movie', 'set', 'universe', 'have', 'impressively', 'rich', 'backstory', 'bureaucratic', 'Hell', 'super-powered', 'accountants', '34', 'God', '34', 'backstory', 'are', 'left', 'dark', 'almost', 'entirely', 'written', 'something', 'based', 'deep', 'source', 'material', 'how', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movie', 'audience', 'lot', 'jedi', 'lightsabers', 'etc', 'source', 'material', 'Drive', 'Angry', ""n't"", 'actually', 'exist', 'anywhere', 'movie', 'itself.While', 'storyline', 'straight-forward', '3d', 'gimmick-heavy', 'action', 'scenes', 'incomprehensible', 'times', 'also', 'movie', 'very', 're-watchable', 'only', 'try', 'puzzle', 'out', 'what', 'exactly', 'was', 'going', 'Between', 'spectacle', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'getting', 'drunken', 'mid-sex', 'gun', 'fight', 'bunch', 'marauders', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'almost', 'impossibly', 'cool', 'portrayal', 'Accountant', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'end', 'also', 'sequel', 'sadly', 'movie', 'disastrous', 'performance', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'never', 'happen']",N/A

Well first, are they fans of Nic Cage in Raising Arizona and City of Angels, or fans of Nic Cage in Kick Ass and Bangkok Dangerous. Mr. Cage is a very versatile actor, so ruling him out of making any particular style of movie is discrediting his versatility. Second, if you're not a fan of over the top action movies, why on earth would you go to see a movie called Drive Angry that clearly showed in the previews that it was an over the top action movie. Now that I've addressed the issues I have with the negative reviews, on to my positive review! This movie was awesome. It had everything a good action flick should have: Action, Sex, Nudity, Blood, Foul Language... and then to top it off, it had all 5 of those AT THE SAME TIME. The acting was good all around, and I never felt like anyone was out of place. It was an extremely fun to watch movie from start to finish, and when it was over, I felt very satisfied with the overall story. The soundtrack was also awesome, and went very well with all of the action. It didn't have 300m dollar special effects, but they were good enough to propel the story. Anyone who is a fan of Shoot Em Up, Kick Ass, Expendables, Crank or any other good extreme action flick, will definitely not be disappointed by this film.

1398728,A1OYNQNK3ZM5QB,B004EPYZOO,J. Meeley,"[0, 0]","Nic Cage's career has been one heck of a roller-coaster ride. From highs so high, you'd think he was worthy of a place among Hollywood's leading men legends, to lows so low, that you wonder if his agent is out to sabotage him to never working in film again, his film credits have run the gamut. In the grand scheme of all that, &#34;Drive Angry,&#34; while not the lowest point he's ever hit, certainly is on that end of the dividing line.Cage plays a man named Milton, who's come back from the depths of Hell, to revenge his daughter's murder and grand-daughter's kidnapping at the hands of Jonah King (played by Billy Burke) and his devil cult. All while picking up a sexy sidekick (played by Amber Heard) and dodging a hell-born truant officer (played by William Fichtner).If that plot sounds completely preposterous, that's only because it is. The film is on the level of a low-budget grindhouse affair, but is lacking in the true grit and feeling of sleaziness that a true one would have. Cage spends the entire film with the same expression on his face, whether he's blowing people away, talking about his love for his daughter, or getting it on with a cheap floozy. Meanwhile, Billy Burke's character is simply evil incarnate, without a single redeeming factor or any complexity of any kind. He doesn't just lack depth of character, but shallowness of character. Amber Heard is simply some very sexy arm candy for Cage, as the plot shows her to be little more than the perpetual damsel in distress, even when she's trying to kick some ass herself. The only one to bring anything of value to this proceeding, is William Fichtner as the hellspawn retriever known as &#34;the Accountant.&#34; His deadpan expressions and flippant remarks make up most of the humor to be found (which isn't much) in this action-paced mess.Co-Writer/Director Patrick Lussier, who's resume includes such cinematic gems like &#34;Dracula 2000,&#34; &#34;The Prophecy 3&#34; and &#34;White Noise 2&#34; opts to leave out such unnecessary trivialities, like a coherent plot, character motivations and explanations, and emotional drama, to give more time to the much more important special effects, action sequences, and 3-D elements. Why create a mood, when you can simply blow things up?Pretty much everything else is just explosions, car chases, and blood-letting. Some of which is fairly well done and the one sole area the film tries to excel at. We get no real insights into Cage's or Heard's characters. The script has Cage telling us how much he loved his daughter and how Heard was &#34;waiting for something&#34; in her life, but it's never really bought to life in the film. There is absolutely zero emotional investment in any of these characters. Even in the most shoot-'em-up action-fest around, you need to make folks care about what happens to the hero. Such is never the case here, because to do that would take time away from blasting people with shotguns and watching cars race down the highway. Despite it's R-rating, the film actually feels like it's aimed to appeal to boys between 12-16 years-old, which is only fitting as the film is on the same maturity level.In the end, &#34;Drive Angry&#34; is an empty barrel, as the amount of noise made during the viewing should no doubt tell you. It hits one-note throughout its 104 minute run time and never even tries to go beyond it. I could almost believe they wanted to make a grindhouse film, except the budget for the action and special effects goes against that, as well as going after a star of Nic Cage's level (although, with films like this to his credits, that might start to change). It's too &#34;shiny&#34; to be a grindhouse film, but too poorly conceived to be a true Hollywood action blockbuster. I suppose if you had a couple hours to kill and were looking for a totally mindless experience, you could do worse than this film. But for the action junkies out there, you have many other offerings that will fill your need for carnage, and are better made films, than this one is. It's really only one to see, when you've seen most everything else this film genre has to offer.",2,"A faux-exploitation film, that tries too hard to be one!",1307404800,"06 7, 2011",2011,4139,"['Nic', 'Cage', 'career', 'been', 'one', 'heck', 'roller-coaster', 'ride', 'highs', 'so', 'high', ""'d"", 'think', 'was', 'worthy', 'place', 'Hollywood', 'leading', 'men', 'lows', 'so', 'low', 'wonder', 'agent', 'out', 'sabotage', 'never', 'working', 'film', 'again', 'film', 'credits', 'have', 'run', 'gamut', 'grand', 'scheme', '34', 'Drive', 'Angry', '34', 'not', 'lowest', 'point', 'ever', 'hit', 'certainly', 'end', 'dividing', 'line.Cage', 'man', 'named', 'Milton', 'who', 'come', 'back', 'depths', 'Hell', 'revenge', 'daughter', 'murder', 'grand-daughter', 'kidnapping', 'hands', 'Jonah', 'King', 'played', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'devil', 'cult', 'picking', 'up', 'sexy', 'sidekick', 'played', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'dodging', 'hell-born', 'truant', 'officer', 'played', 'William', 'Fichtner', '.If', 'plot', 'completely', 'preposterous', 'only', 'film', 'level', 'low-budget', 'grindhouse', 'affair', 'lacking', 'true', 'grit', 'feeling', 'sleaziness', 'true', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'Cage', 'entire', 'film', 'same', 'expression', 'face', 'blowing', 'people', 'away', 'talking', 'love', 'daughter', 'getting', 'cheap', 'floozy', 'Meanwhile', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'character', 'simply', 'evil', 'incarnate', 'single', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'complexity', 'kind', ""n't"", 'just', 'lack', 'depth', 'character', 'shallowness', 'character', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'simply', 'very', 'sexy', 'arm', 'candy', 'Cage', 'plot', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'perpetual', 'damsel', 'distress', 'even', 'when', 'trying', 'kick', 'ass', 'only', 'one', 'bring', 'anything', 'value', 'proceeding', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'hellspawn', 'retriever', 'known', '34', 'Accountant.', '34', 'deadpan', 'expressions', 'flippant', 'remarks', 'make', 'up', 'most', 'humor', 'be', 'found', ""n't"", 'much', 'action-paced', 'mess.Co-Writer/Director', 'Patrick', 'Lussier', 'who', 'resume', 'such', 'cinematic', 'gems', '34', 'Dracula', '2000', '34', '34', 'Prophecy', '3', '34', '34', 'White', 'Noise', '2', '34', 'opts', 'leave', 'out', 'such', 'unnecessary', 'trivialities', 'coherent', 'plot', 'character', 'motivations', 'explanations', 'emotional', 'drama', 'give', 'more', 'time', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'sequences', '3-D', 'elements', 'Why', 'create', 'mood', 'when', 'can', 'simply', 'blow', 'things', 'up', 'Pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'else', 'just', 'explosions', 'car', 'chases', 'blood-letting', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'one', 'sole', 'area', 'film', 'tries', 'excel', 'get', 'real', 'insights', 'Cage', 'Heard', 'characters', 'script', 'Cage', 'telling', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'daughter', 'how', 'Heard', 'was', '34', 'waiting', 'something', '34', 'life', 'never', 'really', 'bought', 'life', 'film', 'absolutely', 'zero', 'emotional', 'investment', 'characters', 'Even', 'most', ""shoot-'em-up"", 'action-fest', 'need', 'make', 'folks', 'care', 'what', 'hero', 'Such', 'never', 'case', 'here', 'do', 'would', 'take', 'time', 'away', 'blasting', 'people', 'shotguns', 'watching', 'cars', 'race', 'down', 'highway', 'R-rating', 'film', 'actually', 'aimed', 'appeal', 'boys', '12-16', 'years-old', 'only', 'fitting', 'film', 'same', 'maturity', 'level.In', 'end', '34', 'Drive', 'Angry', '34', 'empty', 'barrel', 'amount', 'noise', 'made', 'viewing', 'should', 'doubt', 'tell', 'one-note', '104', 'minute', 'run', 'time', 'never', 'even', 'go', 'could', 'almost', 'believe', 'wanted', 'make', 'grindhouse', 'film', 'budget', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'as', 'well', 'going', 'star', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'level', 'films', 'credits', 'might', 'start', 'change', 'too', '34', 'shiny', '34', 'be', 'grindhouse', 'film', 'too', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'be', 'true', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'blockbuster', 'suppose', 'had', 'couple', 'hours', 'kill', 'were', 'looking', 'totally', 'mindless', 'experience', 'could', 'do', 'worse', 'film', 'action', 'there', 'have', 'many', 'other', 'offerings', 'will', 'fill', 'need', 'carnage', 'are', 'better', 'made', 'films', 'one', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'see', 'when', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'everything', 'else', 'film', 'genre', 'offer']",N/A
1398729,A6X6LNZO1C3EZ,B004EPYZOO,J. Munyon,"[2, 3]","""Drive Angry"" has muscle cars, pretty 20 something aged women, a Satanic cult group, state trooper road blocks, fancy weapons, and lots of shooting guns at people with the intent to kill.  There is a lot of vulgar language, lots of gratuitous female nudity, lots of violence, and Nicolas Cage portrays a guy who comes back from the dead, well hell actually, and interacts with still living humans - in particular, the devil worshiping cult leader who killed his daughter, and intends upon sacrificing his granddaughter.  The character portrayed by Nicolas Cage doesn't seem to have much for special powers, but the agent from hell who calls himself the accountant, has all kinds of god-like powers.  The accountant is played by the actor William Fichtner.  William Fichtner has been in ""Equillibrium,"" the TV series ""The West Wing,"" ""Black Hawk Down,"" ""Switchback,"" ""Armageddon,"" and ""Crash.""  Christa Campbell, Katy Mixon, and Charlotte Ross present themselves to us wearing the pajamas God gave them during the film, and Amber Heard just demonstrates her potty mouth.  There is a lot of f-bomb talk, and some 1970's style far away camera shots of older women (of less model quality) that dance around at a campfire party in the nude, but the camera isn't kept still and focused enough to be sure they are actually real women instead of manikins from a clothing store.  Amber Heard doesn't show much skin, and seems oblivious to reality or danger.  David Morse (the dad from ""Contact"") appears as an ally late in the film and basically is just a familiar face to give the movie more star power.  The movie has some interesting parts to it, and good looking women in the buff, however, somehow, this movie falls short of staying in one track.  It doesn't really make Nicolas Cage's character un-kill-able, and the viewer is expected to be okay with waffling between the believable and the insanity-level unbelievability of supernatural elements now and then.  There are several hot women going buff, however Amber Heard seems like she is trying to convince us she has enough acting ability she doesn't need to participate in the skin fest (I'm definitely not convinced). The one hour and forty five minutes movie never gets off the ground and could have been ten times better with somebody else besides Nicolas Cage in the lead role.  The mystery and powers of William Fichtner as the accountant are a much stronger element of this film than Cage's performance.  Billy Burke gives us a 1970's documentary type performance as the cult leader, and could have had a lot more substance to his acting.  The story has potential, but needs some replacements in the casting, as well as a bit better writing to make it less cheesy and less juvenile audience geared for the small genitalia crowd who pseudo-compensate their self-image by the kind of car (or 4-wheel drive pickup) they drive.

1398732,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B004EPYZOO,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 10]","John Milton (Nicolas Cage) has broken out of Hell to save his infant granddaughter from a satanic cult lead by Jonah King (Billy Burke). With the help of Piper (Amber Heard), a young waitress, John pursues King while being pursued himself by The Accountant (William Fichtner), whose mission is to bring John back to Hell. Shot in 3D by director Patrick Lussier, Drive Angry is an over-the-top exploitation film that never takes itself too seriously and fits the grindhouse model exactly as intended. Lussier has never been celebrated for directing quality films (his filmography includes Dracula 2000 and White Noise 2: The Light), but he proves to be capable of directing an unpretentious, balls-out action movie which still works no matter how over-the-top it gets and retains remarkable coherency, never descending into pure stupidity. The film knows what it's doing and it does it well.Drive Angry is gleefully offensive, loaded with gratuitous violence and nudity, and even managed to impress me with its use of the 3D format. Lussier exploits 3D as the gimmick it is (blood, coins, etc. pop out of the screen whenever there's an opportunity) rather than trying to use it ""artistically"" to the extent that it might as well be seen in 2D. It's equally enjoyable in both formats, but there are shots in the 2D version that were obviously specific to the 3D format. As for the action sequences, there are many high-energy chase scenes that are remarkably comprehensible for a Hollywood film, relying on stunt work and form rather than quick cuts and hyperactive edits. Another scene, involving a gunfight while Milton and a woman are in a rather ""delicate"" position has been done before (notably in Shoot `Em Up), but it takes it even further here. It's great fun, but it's the type of scene that may alert you as to whether this film is for you or not.Lussier and his co-writer Todd Farmer have fashioned a script of well-written exploitation that never feels too forced and pushes everything to go further than you'd imagine. This is one of those rare movies that successfully uses its dialogue for the sole purpose of fitting in one-liners and furthering the plot. More impressive is the dialogue is actually legitimately funny and clever rather than desperately trying to be memorable or hip.The cast is made-up of talented character actors lead by master thespian Nicolas Cage. Cage is one of the most misunderstood actors of his generation, frequently accused of sleepwalking through terrible movies for a paycheck. Drive Angry may not look like an exception, but it is. Cage is a master of over-the-top theatrics and this type of film is perfect for allowing his acting instincts to run wild. Oddly enough, for such an over-the-top movie, Cage is remarkably subdued. It's not often that Cage plays a character in a movie with the least amount of quirks; he often seems to be trying to top any other actor who approaches him in the realm of ""quirkiness."" Still, John Milton is one of the few roles that Cage plays almost completely straight. He does a fine job as Milton and even those who are typically anti-Cage shouldn't be bothered much by his performance. I, however, wish he would've injected a little more style into his performance.Piper is tough, independent, and curses like a sailor. As played by the gorgeous Amber Heard, she also happens to be...gorgeous. Believe me; the camera is fully aware of that. Heard isn't generally grouped into the ""serious, young actress"" category, but despite being a petite, model-looking woman she actually makes Piper believable and will no doubt appeal to both young women for her strong-willed attitude and young men for...Being Amber Heard. Impressively, Heard and Cage actually make a good team here and play well off of each other, while simultaneously establishing a convincing emotional bond. That type of chemistry is not required for this type of film, but it successfully adds another dimension to the work.Billy Burke has spent the last few years playing the thankless role of Kristen Stewart's father in the Twilight series, where he usually outshines the entire cast with his subtle performance. As the suave, devilishly charming and equally evil, Jonah King, I didn't even recognize him as the same actor. Even in a role that requires the actor only to have fun, he demonstrates remarkable range.Despite this talent involved, it is character actor William Fichtner who steals every scene as The Accountant. It's such a delightfully quirky performance that will hopefully obtain the cult status it deserves. An actor used to hanging out in the background, Fichtner pushes this character to the forefront with his fascinating interpretation of the character. His performance as the Accountant is compulsively watchable and absolutely hilarious, with his comedic timing responsible for many of the funniest moments in the movie. I would love to see a spin-off with the Accountant and Milton working together; or just the Accountant chasing someone else. Without trying to overstate it, Fichtner is so good I believe every action movie should have its own accountant.The film also features David Morse and Jack McGee (from The Fighter). It's obvious that everyone involved was having a lot of fun making this movie and that translates well onscreen, actually increasing the overall effectiveness of the film. Drive Angry is not a great film, but it is great grindhouse fodder and just a purely fun movie. There are those who heap praise on it and those who trash it mercilessly but after two viewings, I stand by my initial assessment that this is one of the best, most entertaining, and most clever films of its kind. A lovingly crafted piece of exploitation, a fun piece of filmmaking, and probably the most fun I've had in 2011.GRADE: A-",5,"A Fun, Entertaining Ride",1306281600,"05 25, 2011",2011,5803,"['John',

Drive Angry is just a fun movie with some good action & fun characters. Directed by Patrick Lussier he directed White Noise 2, he's going to direct Halloween 3D. Stars Nicholas Cage as John Milton, Amber Heard as Piper, Billy Burke as Jonah King, William Ficthner as The Accountant & Tom Atkins as The Police Captain. The story is this guy named John Milton is after this cult lead by Jonah King they killed his daughter & have his infant granddaughter. So he meets this lady named Piper & she gives him ride to town she finds her Fiance Frank cheating on her Frank is actually played by Todd Farmer the script writer. They get in a fight Milton helps Piper & owns Frank. There is some humor to the scene. Milton takes Piper & they head off. You have this guy The Accountant looking for Milton & Frank doesn't answer his questions. He kills Frank & The Cops show up cause Frank reported his car stolen there going to areest him but The Accountant flips a coin & it turns into a FBI badge. Milton Piper are at this hotel & she finds out about Jonah King he's sent his followers to go & kill John Milton. This scene is pretty funny Nicholas Cage is having s  3  x with some chick  he met & kills bad guys at the same time.  The next day Milton & Piper are being chased by The Accountant & Milton takes him down with a really awesome gun.the car The Accountant is in is knocked off the bridge. Milton goes to this church where Jonah is at but is shot in the eye. Jonah takes Piper & trys to force her into the cult. Milton gets up goes kills the the cult members left behind & goes  after Jonah Piper escapes. A little bit later on you get a very good scene whit The Police Blockade & where The Accountant uses a gas truck really a well done scene. Funny scene with The Tom Atkins character. Then you get to the finish which was well done the ending was lame though. Drive Angry was pretty good. Patrick Lussier did a good job. Nicholas Cage was good. Amber Heard was good not annoying.

Now, if you're a moron that can only think in binary terms, you are probably thinking, ""How can this guy compare those two?!"" or, ""How is this guy who enjoyed this piece of junk going to enjoy 'Tree of Life'"".  Well, let me explain: my tastes are not defined by my pathetic need to be seen as ""cultured"" or ""intelligent"" by others.""Drive Angry"" has everything good action movies should have.  Lots of explosions, car chases, terribly graphic violence, naked chicks, guns, guns, guns, and a satanic cult.  NO, I'm not comparing it to ""Terminator 2"", but alot of the leather-clad butt-rockiness of this movie gave off the same aura as that classic.  Also, the story is incredibly original, unless you can tell me about another movie where a dude escapes from hell to rescue his granddaughter from a satanic cult whilst dodging Satan's reconnaissance agent.  Cage is awesome just for being Cage, but I also enjoyed William Fichtner's role as The Accountant.Briefly, I also want to say how grateful I am that this movie is rated R.  Too many movies today are rated PG-13, thereby leaving out the bullets to heads, f-bombs, and gratuitous nudity that keep annoying families out of theaters.What I really don't understand is how so many people will drool all over Tarantino flick's that seek to emulate trashy cinema and then not enjoy the real deal.  Accept no substitue, ""Drive Angry"" is the real modern grindhouse flick.  It is a movie too busy being awesome to think, and it really doesn't care what your film school boyfriend thinks.Actually, I do understand why somebody would like a Tarantino rip off of trashy cinema but not like this; because this movie doesn't have Tarantino's name on it.  And people are so dumb that somebodies name being on something will immediately make them rate it higher than it really should be.  Did people actually enjoy ""Inglorious Basterds""?  They wouldn't if it hadn't of had Tarantino's name on it.Drive Angry 4Lyfe!",5,"A Terrible ""Film"" but a Great ""Movie""; Among Cage's Best",1309824000,"07 5, 2011",2011,2555,"['want', 'make', 'pretentious', 'person', 'frustrated', 'tell', 'favorite', 'actor', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'very', 'hard', 'people', 'who', 'care', 'what', 'others', 'think', 'enjoy', 'Nicoloas', 'Cage', 'movie', 'mainly', 'Cage', 'clearly', 'opposite', 'obvious', 'Oscar-winner', 'really', ""n't"", 'give', 'flying-flip', 'what', 'other', 'critic', 'thinks', 'Drive', 'Angry', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', '2011', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'Tree', 'Life', 'tomorrow', 'maybe', 'will', 'change', 'point', 'most', 'entertained', ""'ve"", 'been', 'theater', 'late', '2007', 'when', 'watched', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Now', ""'re"", 'moron', 'can', 'only', 'think', 'binary', 'terms', 'are', 'probably', 'thinking', 'How', 'can', 'guy', 'compare', 'two', 'How', 'guy', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'piece', 'junk', 'going', 'enjoy', ""'Tree"", 'Life', 'Well', 'let', 'explain', 'tastes', 'are', 'not', 'defined', 'pathetic', 'need', 'be', 'seen', 'cultured', 'intelligent', 'others', 'Drive', 'Angry', 'everything', 'good', 'action', 'movies', 'should', 'have', 'Lots', 'explosions', 'car', 'chases', 'terribly', 'graphic', 'violence', 'naked', 'chicks', 'guns', 'guns', 'guns', 'satanic', 'cult', 'NO', ""'m"", 'not', 'comparing', 'Terminator', '2', 'alot', 'leather-clad', 'butt-rockiness', 'movie', 'gave', 'off', 'same', 'aura', 'classic', 'Also', 'story', 'incredibly', 'original', 'can', 'tell', 'movie', 'where', 'dude', 'hell', 'rescue', 'granddaughter', 'satanic', 'cult', 'whilst', 'dodging', 'Satan', 'reconnaissance', 'agent', 'Cage', 'awesome', 'just', 'being', 'Cage', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'role', 'Accountant.Briefly', 'also', 'want', 'say', 'how', 'grateful', 'am', 'movie', 'rated', 'R.', 'Too', 'many', 'movies', 'today', 'are', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'thereby', 'leaving', 'out', 'bullets', 'heads', 'f-bombs', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'annoying', 'families', 'theaters.What', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'drool', 'Tarantino', 'flick', 'seek', 'emulate', 'trashy', 'cinema', 'then', 'not', 'enjoy', 'real', 'deal', 'Accept', 'substitue', 'Drive', 'Angry', 'real', 'modern', 'grindhouse', 'flick', 'movie', 'too', 'busy', 'being', 'awesome', 'think', 'really', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'film', 'school', 'boyfriend', 'thinks.Actually', 'do', 'understand', 'why', 'somebody', 'would', 'like', 'Tarantino', 'rip', 'trashy', 'cinema', 'not', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'Tarantino', 'name', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'dumb', 'somebodies', 'name', 'being', 'something', 'will', 'immediately', 'make', 'rate', 'higher', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'Did', 'people', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'Inglorious', 'Basterds', 'would', ""n't"", 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'Tarantino', 'name', 'it.Drive', 'Angry', '4Lyfe']",N/A

1398745,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B004EPYZOO,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","Not intended for the timid artistic souls amongst us.Falling into and under the ""grindhouse"" genre of filmmaking, this is the best of Saturday-Night-At-The-Drive-In homage: Naked women, extreme bloody violence and outrageous storytelling. I remember this period of movies well and have very fond memories of places that today exist only in historical images and in the hearts of wistful times long gone. These action/thrillers and ubiquitous kung-fu flicks were the dominant form of cheap entertainment from the late 1960s through the early 1980s when home video cassettes were introduced into the marketplace, thus killing the popular weekend gatherings. It's actually quite sad. I can recall families and friends who would meet up at the drive-in, bringing their potluck foodstuffs, kids all running around, having a blast as a community at the drive-in; now we're separated by byte and HD home set-ups. (apologies for the misty tangent)It's interesting how much more enjoyable Cage can be when he actually acts, and by that I mean, when he stops acting like himself. Because his real personality is so much less enjoyable, less interesting and infinitely more lame. Pompous overbearing fool would be a step up if you've ever encountered the man. So I really enjoy the times when he's able to put aside his real-life persona in favor of a movie character. And playing Milton (obvious nod to 'Paradise Lost' author of the same moniker) has Cage at his best - his real self is completely gone and replaced by a seriously focused deceased dude on a hellbent mission.Shotgun blast of pure adrenaline with Amber Heard portraying kick-ass temptress Piper, lending her ample assets to help Milton save his granddaughter from a demented cult. Her performance is spot-on perfect. With just enough trailer trash, just enough action, just enough hot pants, and just enough modern fully-realized hip chick to pull off her role with supreme skill. Impressed with this young actress; it'll be interesting to see what she does next.And Hell hath no fury like The Accountant; the Devil's own bean-counter who doesn't take it well when one of the beans jumps out of the pot. Deliciously played by William Fichtner, who does the dry humorless soul cruncher with wicked fun. Been a fan of the man for many years going back to both the small and big screen. He's a consummate actor of range who always seems to be on the verge of breaking into big screen leading man roles, but unfortunately might be too gothic to pull off the all important romantic lead. Which is just as well, I'm fond of his cool calculating characters.Loved the extreme explosions, outstanding muscle car chases and the over-the-top brutal violence. And, no, bodies hit with .45 caliber rounds do not 'fly' off their feet and out of windows. (laughing) But that's the point. Outlandish outrageousness is the theme of this grindhouse.Strangely enough, I found the story deeper, richer and more complex than so-called ""serious"" films of today. There's a genuine energy born from movie makers like Director Patrick Lussier, an energy that eludes many cerebral arthouse productions. It seems we're stuck with an entire generation of navel-studying writers and directors who, collectively, seem to believe that having people aimlessly vomit lines from a mundane script, then shooting that screenplay with unsteady high-contrast video somehow constitutes drama. An example of this was the highly touted 'Sideways' - which epitomizes pretentious dung heap filmmaking. I was caught up in the hype and paid good money to watch that pointlessness. That's a good two hours of my life I'll wish I had back when I'm on my deathbed.Lot's-O-Fun if you can appreciate this kind of harsh action/adventure.",4,Shotgun Blast Of Pure Adrenaline and Harsh Bloody Fun,1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,3742,"['Not', 'intended', 'timid', 'artistic', 'souls', 'amongst', 'us.Falling', 'grindhouse', 'genre', 'filmmaking', 'best', 'Saturday-Night-At-The-Drive-In', 'homage', 'Naked', 'women', 'extreme', 'bloody', 'violence', 'outrageous', 'storytelling', 'remember', 'period', 'movies', 'well', 'have', 'very', 'fond', 'memories', 'places', 'today', 'exist', 'only', 'historical', 'images', 'hearts', 'wistful', 'times', 'long', 'gone', 'action/thrillers', 'ubiquitous', 'kung-fu', 'flicks', 'were', 'dominant', 'form', 'cheap', 'entertainment', 'late', '1960s', 'early', '1980s', 'when', 'home', 'video', 'cassettes', 'were', 'introduced', 'marketplace', 'thus', 'killing', 'popular', 'weekend', 'gatherings', 'actually', 'quite', 'sad', 'can', 'recall', 'families', 'friends', 'who', 'would', 'meet', 'up', 'drive-in', 'bringing', 'potluck', 'foodstuffs', 'kids', 'running', 'around', 'having', 'blast', 'community', 'drive-in', 'now', ""'re"", 'separated', 'byte', 'HD', 'home', 'set-ups', 'apologies', 'misty', 'tangent', 'interesting', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Cage', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'actually', 'mean', 'when', 'acting', 'real', 'personality', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'less', 'interesting', 'infinitely', 'more', 'lame', 'Pompous', 'overbearing', 'fool', 'would', 'be', 'step', 'up', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'encountered', 'man', 'really', 'enjoy', 'times', 'when', 'able', 'put', 'aside', 'real-life', 'persona', 'favor', 'movie', 'character', 'playing', 'Milton', 'obvious', 'nod', ""'Paradise"", 'Lost', 'author', 'same', 'moniker', 'Cage', 'best', 'real', 'self', 'completely', 'gone', 'replaced', 'seriously', 'focused', 'deceased', 'dude', 'hellbent', 'mission.Shotgun', 'blast', 'pure', 'adrenaline', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'portraying', 'kick-ass', 'temptress', 'Piper', 'lending', 'ample', 'assets', 'help', 'Milton', 'save', 'granddaughter', 'demented', 'cult', 'performance', 'spot-on', 'perfect', 'just', 'enough', 'trailer', 'trash', 'just', 'enough', 'action', 'just', 'enough', 'hot', 'pants', 'just', 'enough', 'modern', 'fully-realized', 'hip', 'chick', 'pull', 'off', 'role', 'supreme', 'skill', 'Impressed', 'young', 'actress', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'next.And', 'Hell', 'fury', 'Accountant', 'Devil', 'own', 'bean-counter', 'who', ""n't"", 'take', 'well', 'when', 'one', 'beans', 'jumps', 'pot', 'Deliciously', 'played', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'who', 'dry', 'humorless', 'soul', 'cruncher', 'wicked', 'fun', 'Been', 'fan', 'man', 'many', 'years', 'going', 'back', 'small', 'big', 'screen', 'consummate', 'actor', 'range', 'who', 'always', 'be', 'verge', 'breaking', 'big', 'screen', 'leading', 'man', 'roles', 'unfortunately', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'gothic', 'pull', 'off', 'important', 'romantic', 'lead', 'Which', 'just', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'fond', 'cool', 'calculating', 'characters.Loved', 'extreme', 'explosions', 'outstanding', 'muscle', 'car', 'chases', 'over-the-top', 'brutal', 'violence', 'bodies', 'hit', '.45', 'caliber', 'rounds', 'do', 'not', ""'fly"", 'off', 'feet', 'windows', 'laughing', 'point', 'Outlandish', 'outrageousness', 'theme', 'grindhouse.Strangely', 'enough', 'found', 'story', 'deeper', 'richer', 'more', 'complex', 'so-called', 'serious', 'films', 'today', 'genuine', 'energy', 'born', 'movie', 'makers', 'Director', 'Patrick', 'Lussier', 'energy', 'many', 'cerebral', 'arthouse', 'productions', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'entire', 'generation', 'navel-studying', 'writers', 'directors', 'who', 'collectively', 'seem', 'believe', 'having', 'people', 'aimlessly', 'vomit', 'lines', 'mundane', 'script', 'then', 'shooting', 'screenplay', 'unsteady', 'high-contrast', 'video', 'somehow', 'drama', 'example', 'was', 'highly', 'touted', ""'Sideways"", 'pretentious', 'dung', 'heap', 'filmmaking', 'was', 'caught', 'up', 'hype', 'paid', 'good', 'money', 'watch', 'pointlessness', 'good', 'two', 'hours', 'life', ""'ll"", 'wish', 'had', 'back', 'when', ""'m"", ""deathbed.Lot's-O-Fun"", 'can', 'appreciate', 'kind', 'harsh', 'action/adventure']",N/A

1398748,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004EPYZOO,Mark Turner,"[4, 6]","The craze for 3-D movies is still working its way to the big screen across the country. I've found it amusing at times but on the whole I could do away with the need to wear a second pair of glasses let alone the extra expense that a ticket for a 3-D film entails. Perhaps it was that expense that caused DRIVE ANGRY to not be the big hit it was expected to be. This is unfortunate because all in all it was a fun film.The films starts off with a bang as John Milton (Nicolas Cage) revs down the road in a muscle car intent on catching three bad guys in truck. He forces them to crash, shoots one's hand off, blasts the second and then threatens the third unless he gives him information. It seems that he is chasing a group of bad guys with one purpose: to save a baby they've kidnapped.As the story unfolds we finally discover that Cage was a very bad man in his own right who was killed and sent to Hell. He escaped when he witness his daughter's death at the hands of Jonah King (Billie Burke), a satanic cult leader who intends to sacrifice her child on the next full moon in the hopes of bringing Hell to Earth. Milton has set his sights on revenge and only the rescue of the child and death of King will suffice.As he sets out to track down King, Milton requires a new car having crashed the last one. A chance encounter with a young waitress named Piper (Amber Heard) leads to a ride down the road. When he saves her from an abusive boyfriend after she's been knocked unconscious, the pair head south for Florida via Louisiana. FL is her destination, LA his.Along the way the pair is being followed by two different people. The first is a man who refers to himself as ""The Accountant"" (William Fichtner). In actuality this is Hell's agent on Earth trying to track down and recollect Milton. Why he can't just pop in and out where he wants is never explained but like all Hell employed bounty hunters he just follows and kills along his way to catch the escapee.A run in with the followers of King leads to Piper and Milton being captured. As King speeds off with Piper and the baby having just shot Milton one would think the film would end. But keep in mind that Milton is already dead and a headshot won't be the sort of thing to stop him.The film rolls along with tons of car chases and mayhem, explosions and gunfight, until a final confrontation between Milton and King finally arrives.This is the stuff that drive-in movies were made of back in their heyday during the seventies: cars speeding down the highway, cults that just seem downright stupid, gun battles using guns that never seem to run out of ammo and a smattering of nudity here and there. As I watched I kept thinking of past films like VANISHING POINT and RACE WITH THE DEVIL, to classics of the genre.The film is filled with completely unbelievable items that you either accept as part of the universe it is set in or just shake your head asking how anyone could expect you to believe it at all. Perhaps the most extreme (and the raciest) is when Milton is in the middle of having sex only to leap up still attached and begin shooting bad guys left and right. Not only does this tell you how unbelievable the film is but also how it got the R rating it deserves as well.Cage does a great job as the determined tough guy out to take down those worse than him for a noble cause. Fichtner is amazing to watch as the smooth operating collector who feels no remorse taking out various bad guys or telling people he'll seem them soon, some in years others in months.

1398758,A2ARDVMUGDFED6,B004EPYZOO,MiRSD,"[4, 4]","I'll start off by saying that this movie is not for everyone. First, you need to have a tolerence for Nicholas Cage -- I don't mind the guy, but I know a lot of people can't stand him. If you're in this group, don't even bother with the movie.This is also not a movie that you expect a reasonable plot from -- you need to be ""OK"" (and preferably enjoy) over the top movies that don't make sense at times.If you're okay with that, you'll probably like Drive Angry.My issue with the film itself is that it seemed to be going for a modern over-the-top exploitation/grindhouse type film (something like Planet Terror, the Crazy 88's scene in Kill Bill, or Machine Girl), but it just never reaches that level. Reading the amazon.com editorial review on the product page, it sounds like this is one of the most over-the-top films out there, filled with insane explosions, sex and violence throughout. There are parts in it that just fall flat or could have been so much better. Overall I'd give it about a 3.5/5 for the movie. If you're going to make a movie like that, you've gotta go ""all out"" as the storyline alone isn't going to win any awards. Would a ""toned down"" Planet Terror be as entertaining?The 2-disc Blu-Ray 3D combo contains a 3D Blu-Ray (3D-only) with no extras and a Blu-Ray 2D with commentary, deleted scenes and more. Somewhat plain for a newer release, and I would have liked to see some more behind the scenes stuff than what's on it.Both discs are in 1080p, 1.78:1 and have DTS-HD Master Audio which sounds great!The 3D in this movie works well -- it was filmed natively in 3D (meaning it wasn't shot in 2D and converted) so it looks much more natural and shows more depth. I didn't find any ghosting in it, but I'm using a newer 3DTV (Panasonic DT30). Most of the movie uses depth - different layers seeming to go deep into the TV, but there are quite a few ""pop out"" scenes (including the usual gimmicks you're used to, like flipping a coin up towards the camera so it flies towards you). I thought these made the 3D presentation even more enjoyable, and it was nice to see them use a number of these throughout (opposed to just depth, and 1 or 2 popouts in the movie). The 2D presentation also looks very good, but if possible you'll want to watch it in 3D.",4,"Decent, fun movie with some very nice 3D",1316822400,"09 24, 2011",2011,2277,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'First', 'need', 'have', 'tolerence', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'guy', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', ""'re"", 'group', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'movie.This', 'also', 'not', 'movie', 'expect', 'reasonable', 'plot', 'need', 'be', 'OK', 'preferably', 'enjoy', 'top', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'times.If', ""'re"", 'okay', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'Drive', 'Angry.My', 'issue', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'going', 'modern', 'over-the-top', 'exploitation/grindhouse', 'type', 'film', 'something', 'Planet', 'Terror', 'Crazy', '88', 'scene', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Machine', 'Girl', 'just', 'never', 'level', 'Reading', 'amazon.com', 'editorial', 'review', 'product', 'page', 'one', 'most', 'over-the-top', 'films', 'there', 'filled', 'insane', 'explosions', 'sex', 'violence', 'are', 'parts', 'just', 'fall', 'flat', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Overall', ""'d"", 'give', '3.5/5', 'movie', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'go', 'out', 'storyline', 'alone', ""n't"", 'going', 'win', 'awards', 'Would', 'toned', 'down', 'Planet', 'Terror', 'be', 'entertaining', '2-disc', 'Blu-Ray', '3D', 'combo', '3D', 'Blu-Ray', '3D-only', 'extras', 'Blu-Ray', '2D', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'more', 'Somewhat', 'plain', 'newer', 'release', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'what', 'it.Both', 'discs', 'are', '1080p', '1.78:1', 'have', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', 'great', '3D', 'movie', 'well', 'was', 'filmed', 'natively', '3D', 'meaning', 'was', ""n't"", 'shot', '2D', 'converted', 'much', 'more', 'natural', 'more', 'depth', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'ghosting', ""'m"", 'using', 'newer', '3DTV', 'Panasonic', 'DT30', 'Most', 'movie', 'depth', 'different', 'layers', 'seeming', 'go', 'deep', 'TV', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'pop', 'out', 'scenes', 'including', 'usual', 'gimmicks', ""'re"", 'used', 'flipping', 'coin', 'up', 'camera', 'thought', 'made', '3D', 'presentation', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'use', 'number', 'opposed', 'just', 'depth', '1', '2', 'popouts', 'movie', '2D', 'presentation', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'possible', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', '3D']",N/A

You would think of all movies, this would be the one he would go overboard, but he wisely tones it down a few notches. Amber Heard plays the sidekick role, which she tries to inject with toughness. It didn't always work, but she adds a dose of energy and is quite the babe. Did I say she is hot? The standout by far is William Fichtner as hell's accountant. Basically he is the dude Satan sends out when someone manages to escape. You can tell he is having a great time and like Cage, he doesn't stray into the overacting category.The 3-D was okay, but for a film that claims to be ""Shot in 3-D"" I wasn't that impressed. The CGI ranged from good to average, but for a movie like this, I didn't expect it to be polished.If you liked Planet Terror, Death Proof or Piranha 3-D, you should have a blast with this one.

As one amazing morality play, it fits perfectly in a corrupt world, and in a world where film makers are made to adhere to an arbitrary code, Lussier and Cage, collaborate to make a film of mythic proportions. For those stuck on issues about the F bomb, please note that Milton never swears once during the entire film. He has a pure sense of purpose with a not so pure method ( now where in real life have we heard those points before ???? :-)... mmm, well, just about every war in  at least the last 20 years). The film is made to entertain however, the modern films are the worlds mythology. This realm is where in one scene Milton promises to drink out of Frank's skull, and achieves that in the end scenes. The sense of dramatic come-uppance that the bad guys get is very tangible, as is the surreal way it is delivered. After all, this is not reality, this is escapism. Watch this film without some preconceptions, and you might see the massive mythic component, and one has to do with the sacrifice of the baby ... check out what satan's minions ( Milton and the accountant) have to say about the Cult's viewpoint. But as Lussier says in the commentary, you make up your mind. And also check out the images I dropped into the shared image area about the coin, and the God-killer, I would love to see what you have to say in your review, but please watch the film ( it is a fun film to watch , and I do have morals) before writing your review.

A front view of a black charger with Nick and Amber in it with hell in the background would have been clearer to me but I am a graphic artist by trade so I have to put in my two cents.  Again, this was not what I expected but the concept (spoiler) of Nick Cage as an escaped damned soul stealing a magic gun from hell and escaping to save his daughter from a crazy cultist who would sacrifice his only daughter is great.  William Fichtner as the devil tracker (The Accountant) was amazing, I will never look at the song ""That's the way I like it"" by K.C. and the Sunshine band again.  Also the ""Doing it"" and ""Doing people with a gun"" scene was great, I never saw a scene like that before.  I do wish Amber's role was more integrated with the story and not in the sexist roles you see for women: the babe, the bate, the mother.  Personally I wish she was the actual mother from heaven, coming to help.  I guess that would change the story quite a bit and leave the child parentless unless David Morse's character lived and took the child but I think he would make a nice dad character.  He played a caring soul.  Of everyone I thought William Fichtner's role was the best.  Every second he was on the screen he did something funny, crazy or both.  I laughed so hard it hurt.

After the murder of his daughter and the kidnapping of his grandchild John Milton (Cage), escapes from Hell and tries to save the baby from a cult.  Before we begin I should let you know that I am not, nor have ever been a Nic Cage fan.  There are a handful of movies of his that I do like, and this one is in no way part of that group.  After watching the preview I was not looking forward to watching this and after seeing it, it was much worse then I expected. I really am speechless about this movie.  The effects were kinda cool.  William Fichtner was actually good in this, but the dialog made his character not as threatening as he could have been. This is from the same director of ""My Bloody Valentine"", so if you have seen that you know what to expect.  The fact that this movie tried to take itself seriously and not a tounge-in-cheek movie like ""Machete"" was makes it even worse.  Roger Ebert says you should not be friends with anyone that likes this.  Peter Travers says it would be better if you were stoned or at least buzzed.  I say the movie was 97% total crap, the 3% is because there was a lot of nudity.  I know many people will love this because there are a lot of Cage fans that rent from us.  That makes me sad.

Sure it's kind of a bummer to watch Nicolas Cage scrapping the bottom of the barrel given the fact that he was once on of the finest actors of his generation but at least with &#34;Drive Angry&#34; you get the sense that he's at least in on the joke. Amber Heard, well she kind of serves her purpose as the pretty and snarky sidekick. She's serviceable but if this was a better movie she'd leave a lot to be desired.

1398806,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004EPYZOO,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","""Drive Angry"" stars Nicholas Cage as one ""Milton"" hell-bent on revenge, trying to retrieve his granddaughter from a cult religious leader Jonah King (Billy Burke), who abducted her after murdering Milton's daughter. But don't take the film's subject matter too seriously as a grindhouse-type action movie is full of tongue-in-cheek moments, like our hero's ridiculously over-the-top dialogues and borderline silly shootouts. In a motel room Milton is seen gunning down the henchmen - while having a sex with a lady.It's a bad taste, and ""Drive Angry"" is supposed to be that way. The story doesn't make much sense - we don't exactly know how Milton (John?) escaped from the hell, or why an ""FBI"" agent (actually ""The Accountant"") played by scenery-chewing, scene-stealing William Fichtner has to chase him. It's all about guns, gores and cars, especially muscle cars. Director Patrick Lussier's use of 3D techniques is also old-fashioned. You don't get the subtlety of the visual world of ""Avatar."" In ""Drive Angry"" objects will be flying at you even when they don't need to.Patrick Lussier (following his ""My Bloody Valentine 3D"") knows what he is doing, but compared with other recent examples of films inspired by the campy 1970s exploitation movies (like ""Machete""), the level of violence seems tame, for better or worse. Also, the film stars Amber Heard and David Morse, but Morse's role is disappointingly small. Perhaps directors like Rodriguez or Tarantino would have given him more to do.""Drive Angry"" is a throwback to the trashy 70s style B-action film, updated with the modern (but not best kind of) special effects and the star Nicholas Cage.

Introduce a hot babe into the mix who can hold her own and a satanic character labeled the 'accountant' who wants to get our hero back to hell before Satan finds out and you have the gist of Director Patrick Lussier's 'DRIVE ANGRY', an entertaining hell ride of an action movie.  Nicholas Cage persists in acting in some wild genre titles and is perfect for this role , gorgeous Amber Heard is our mortal waitress who aids Cage and Billy Burke giving the villainy a great upgrade.  William Fichtner as the 'accountant' steals the film and 80's B-movie stalwart Tom Atkins returns in a great cameo.  The usual fight / car chase / incendiary explosions titillate the senses with Michael Wandmacher's excellent electric guitar score aiding the rush.

It'salso really funny, like the fat slob who immediately takes out his cellphone to take a picture of the half-naked brunette beaten-up by Piper.Speaking of Heard, she's a little thin for my tastes but appealingnevertheless and the filmmakers definitely take advantage of herbeauty, yet not in a crude way (although there are a couple of smuttyscenes featuring other women).The characters are of the redneck trash variety, including the twoprotagonists. I point this out because some might be turned off bytheir unwholesomeness. Despite their gruff exterior, however, you startto see their humanity, particularly as the story progresses. Milton's aliteral lost soul, but he goes all-out to save his baby granddaughter,which is certainly Christ-like. Piper's not quite as lost, but she'sjust a product of her spiritually-bereft environment. She's alsodynamic and bold, albeit foul. As the yarn unfolds these charactersconnect in a father-daughter fashion and their love and respect nearthe end is almost moving.At the end of the day &#34;Drive Angry&#34; is about as forgettable as mostSyfy flicks, except that it has a much bigger budget and therefore aslicker look. Regardless, it does its job; it entertains. It's similarto the Ghost Rider movies, but without the supernatural overtness ofGhost Rider, e.g. a flaming skeleton who rides a flame cycle, althoughit has some of this, mostly at the climax.The film was shot in Louisiana and runs 104 minutes.GRADE: B-",4,Comic book supernatural thriller,1385683200,"11 29, 2013",2013,2073,"['34', 'Drive', 'Angry', '34', '2011', 'cartoony', 'thriller', 'supernatural', 'guy', 'named', 'Milton', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'who', 'underworld', 'inorder', 'save', 'infant', 'granddaughter', 'who', 'been', 'taken', 'captive', 'aband', 'satanists', 'headed', 'Jonah', 'King', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'Milton', 'trailis', 'mysterious', 'man', 'called', 'Accountant', 'William', 'Fichtner', ""it'sunclear"", 'friend', 'foe', 'Milton', 'up', 'energetic', 'youngwoman', 'Piper', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'chase', 'on.This', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'thriller', 'max', 'comic', 'book', 'cometo', 'life', 'meant', 'entertain', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', ""It'salso"", 'really', 'funny', 'fat', 'slob', 'who', 'immediately', 'out', 'cellphone', 'take', 'picture', 'half-naked', 'brunette', 'beaten-up', 'Piper.Speaking', 'Heard', 'little', 'thin', 'tastes', 'appealingnevertheless', 'filmmakers', 'definitely', 'take', 'advantage', 'herbeauty', 'yet', 'not', 'crude', 'way', 'are', 'couple', 'smuttyscenes', 'featuring', 'other', 'women', '.The', 'characters', 'are', 'redneck', 'trash', 'variety', 'including', 'twoprotagonists', 'point', 'out', 'might', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'bytheir', 'unwholesomeness', 'gruff', 'exterior', 'however', 'startto', 'see', 'humanity', 'particularly', 'story', 'Milton', 'aliteral', 'lost', 'soul', 'all-out', 'save', 'baby', 'granddaughter', 'certainly', 'Christ-like', 'Piper', 'not', 'quite', 'lost', ""she'sjust"", 'product', 'spiritually-bereft', 'environment', 'alsodynamic', 'bold', 'albeit', 'foul', 'yarn', 'charactersconnect', 'father-daughter', 'fashion', 'love', 'respect', 'nearthe', 'end', 'almost', 'end', 'day', '34', 'Drive', 'Angry', '34', 'as', 'forgettable', 'mostSyfy', 'flicks', 'much', 'bigger', 'budget', 'therefore', 'aslicker', 'look', 'Regardless', 'job', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'movies', 'supernatural', 'overtness', 'ofGhost', 'Rider', 'e.g', 'flaming', 'skeleton', 'who', 'flame', 'cycle', 'althoughit', 'mostly', 'climax.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Louisiana', '104', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B-']",N/A
