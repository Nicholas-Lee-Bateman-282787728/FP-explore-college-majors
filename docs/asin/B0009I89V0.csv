905998,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,B0009I89V0,J. Michael Click,"[0, 0]","Don't be misled by the mawkish title!  ""All Mine to Give"" is a warm, touching, but never overly-sentimental film about a pair of Scottish immigrants who settle in Wisconsin during the mid-1800's.  Based on a true story, the first half of the film shows the couple establishing themselves in their new country; the latter half deals with their six children who are orphaned when the oldest son is only twelve years old.  There's humor and heartbreak to spare along the way, and the film strikes a delicate and satisfying balance throughout.Beautifully filmed in rich, saturated Technicolor and sensitively directed by Allen Reisner, the movie boasts brilliant performances by a huge cast of talented actors, each of whom is given a special chance to shine.  Glynis Johns and Cameron Mitchell are superb as the parents, and juvenile actor Rex Thompson offers an uncommonly fine performance as the eldest son.  Pay close attention to veteran character actor Ernest Truex who plays the town doctor; he manages to tug at the heartstrings even when ""tossing away"" his lines, especially in the scene in which Thompson tries to pay him for the services Truex has rendered throughout the years.Although this is promoted as a ""holiday movie"" because the climax of the film takes place on Christmas Day, in truth, this fine film is worth watching and enjoying any time of the year.  The DVD offers generally pleasing audio and video (although a couple of scenes near the end have some greenish shadows in them).  There are no extra features.

906001,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B0009I89V0,Kevin Killian,"[0, 4]","Robert osborne said this was the greatest tearjerker of all time so I devoted days of my Christmas vacation to watching the thing, sneaking it on when my wife was out of the room, for she hates tear jerkers and prefers more artistic pictures.Yes, I was a little disapppointed in the results, for at the end I came away thinking, that was awfully sad, but when I touched my face I felt no tears, only the familiar dryness that comes when a face has been pressed too close to the TV screen.  In fact I hadn't come close to crying once, except maybe when the Scots accents of Cameron Mitchell and Glynis Johns threatened to undermine my understanding of their dialogue.All I can say is that in classic Hollywood, audiences must have been allowed enormous freedom, for surely today no actors would be allowed to use so broad an accent.  It was like watching a Ken Loach movie, whwre three quarters of the time you frankly can't make out what the actors are saying, you just pick up cues by their body language or their grim expressions.  In this movie, I would say that Cameron Mitchell takes acting honors, while Glynis Johns, usually so sensuous, chic and modern, is badly miscast as the prim, ignorant, straitlaced pioneer lass who yearns only to learn to read and later, to make sure her children are placed in good homes.  If this was really her plan, she sure chose a feeble way to ensure it would happen.SPOILERS AHEAD.  The children are surrounded by horrible adults taken out of a Sinclair Lewis vision of American life, so that when their parents die one by one, so that the oldest boy is 12 when he and his five younger siblings are orphaned, he must somehow find places to lodge them, going around in the dead of winter with kids on his sleigh, begging the horrid neighbors to take them in one by one.  This part I imagine if I was a little boy in the 1950s, and I was watching this in the movie theater, I would find utterly sad, but as an adult I just wondered how they were going to make this feasible.  They just changed it around so that the adults are all now sweet and helpful, eager to assist young Robbie and to adopt even the plainest and most backward of the kids.I kept thinking what would really happen if this was real life.  We know the frontier was not a nurturing place for children, and that sixty per cent of them died before the age of 14.  Unfortunately some of these children would become pawns in the expanding sex trade of Wisconsin, while others would just perish in the snow.  Now that's a tragedy.  But the movie says, based on a true story, and when that happens, you know they have maybe 1 per cent true story and the rest Hollywood hackery.END OF SPOILERS.Patty McCormack plays the same part as she played in THE BAD SEED, she's Rhoda Penmark all over again, bossing around the unfortunate children in her care.  She must be the only child in the movie who went on to do anything else?  Although some have said that the boy who played on LASSIE is also in this film.

Thomas ""LibraryFiend""","[76, 77]","WARNING, SPOILERS, etc.This DVD's cover art, which is original to the movie's release over fifty years ago, has a tagline that reads: ""Six kids on a true and wonderful adventure!"" This is one of the most misleading teasers in cinematic public relations history. It has the reader imagining a sextuplet of young ones perhaps sledding on particularly icy mountains or facing down some Scrooge-like, anti-Christmas archnemesis. In fact, it's about children losing both parents to highly contagious diseases and having their family rent permanently asunder.This tale is based on a true-life story set in Wisconsin. Robert and Mamie Eunson (Cameron Mitchell and Glynis Johns) are Scots who have just landed in America (the year is 1856), having been invited there by Mamie's uncle. They arrive in the tiny logging village of Eureka, only to be informed that both uncle and his cabin have been incinerated in a house fire. The Eunsons are assisted by the friendly locals in reconstructing the house and Robert takes to tipping timber. It should be noted Mamie is heavily pregnant upon their reaching Eureka; she delivers baby Robbie soon after the cabin is completed. Robert eventually starts a successful boat building business and Mamie gives birth to five more children: Jimmy, Kirk, Annabelle, Elizabeth, and Jane. The Eunsons are prospering and happy--until little Kirk is diagnosed with diptheria. Mamie and Kirk are quarantined while Robert takes the other children away. The boy recovers, but the goodbye kiss he gave Dadda before his departure proves fatal, and Mr. Eunson succumbs.Mamie takes to working as a seamstress and Robbie becomes the man of the house. Things stabilize, but only briefly: tired and work-worn, Mamie contracts typhoid. Knowing she won't survive, she charges her eldest with finding good homes for his siblings. After her death, Robbie does exactly that, dispatching his brothers and sisters to kindly townsfolk. Stoic and resigned during the process, he does break down when he's alone and sees the tree outside the homestead where his father had carved the names of the children into the bark. Baby Jane is the last to be handed over--Robbie stands at the door of a house and asks the woman who answers, ""Will you take my sister, ma'am?"" Pathos, lachrymose, mourning, and gloom! (It reminds me that in Great Britain, this movie was released under the title The Day They Gave Babies Away...*gulp*!)He then turns and trudges, solitary and struggling, up a hill in a snowstorm. You may ask, ""What does this horribly sad tale have to do with Christmas?"" Robbie is breaking up the clan on Christmas Eve, wisely thinking people are more likely to accept taking in an orphan while filled with the holiday spirit.I remember having my grade school show this film when I was a kid and half the auditorium was weeping openly by the end. While many people would avoid something this maudlin during a time of year we're enjoined to be merry and bright, I find it triumphant and warm-hearted.

these films are of varying degrees of quality,and none too spectacular,I suppose they figure why not bring them out,dust them off and see whether or not they can make some money off of them from an entirely new generation.I had seen this film on TV way back in the early 60s,I think,and I didn't think much of it.But looking at it now I have a bit higher opinion of it than I originally did.The story finds an immigrant couple fresh off the boat from the Shetland Islands,Robert and Mamie,seeking a new life in Eureka,Wisconsin in the late 1800s.They come to seek out a relative who lives just outside town but are told that the house burned down just three weeks earlier,and that the relative perished.They sit in despair,but not for too long.Mamie is pregnant and winter is coming on and they decide to stay and build a homestead right beside their relatives burned down home.At first Robert is doing everything by himself,but eventually the nearby towns folks come along and chip in to help him and his wife build the house and welcome them properly into their town.Robert gets a job in a lumber camp over 20 miles from home.The boss is a cantankerous Irishman(Hale)and the two are constantly butting heads.Eventually a fight man to man changes their feelings towards each other,and they become fast friends.One baby comes along,followed by another and still another until there are six children in all.Robert quits his lumbering work and starts a boat building business beside their home.One day one of their younger sons contracts diphtheria.Robert takes the children away for a spell and the crisis soon passes.However Robert himself comes down with the disease and succumbs to it.Mamie takes over as head of the household but she becomes worn down to a frazzle and succumbs to typhoid fever,leaving young Robbie,their first born,as the head of the household.It is Christmas eve and they bury their mother,but as the children leave the church,young Robbie talks with the doctor about their future.Everyone is concerned for their welfare,but Robbie persuades them to put off a proposed meeting to deal with them until after Christmas.The doctor and others present acquiesce to his request.Once home Robbie gets to thinking that Christmas day might be the ideal time for him to start farming out his brothers and sisters to proper foster homes in the area.It is a good idea as Robbie does indeed spend a long and emotional Christmas day making sure each and every sibling is taken care of.The film ends as Robbie heads off alone to work in a lumber camp,in the deep snow.The film takes a while to warm itself up to its viewing audience.Mitchell's Scottish brogue leaves alot to be desired,and the couple is your usual Hollywood stereotypical Scots.I can see someone from Edinburgh sitting there saying""You have to be kidding me"".It's not until the couple finally begin having and raising their children that the film really starts to get a little interesting.We also wonder while this is happening what the picture has to do with Christmas,but of course the pay off finally comes near the end.The film is a good family picture though and has alot of real family values,warmth and heart.That is the key message that comes through loud and clear after all is said and done.Very few films are made like this today,unfortunately.Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is in wonderful viewing condition.There are no extras.All in all a nice little family film,gushing with family warmth,togetherness and heart.Once over the obvious flaws in characterization,and the slow beginning,it does eventually start to pay off and the Christmas connection is more than apparent with its bitter sweet ending.Recommended.",3,A pleasant 50s Xmas
