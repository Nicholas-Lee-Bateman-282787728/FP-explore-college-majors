I do however know when I hear music that takes over my soul and moves me to tears, something magical is happening. I saw such beauty and passion between the leading characters and I felt blessed to have stummbled across this ballet. I couldn't take my eyes off of my TV screen.Lis Jeppesen is so graceful and I had to watch this story a second time because I didn't want it to end. I had to share it immediately so I ordered it and sent it to my parents. I knew that they would appreciate it even more. My father is German (loves Opera, ballet, classical music) and my mother used to dance ballet when she was very young. Mom called me after she and Dad watched it and they were very impressed.I'd never heard of this story and it was easy to follow and understand what was happening. It's a tragic tale of a man (about to be married) falls in love with a fairy but his intense love leads to tears.",5,"Stunning performance, in my opinon.",1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,1010,"[""'m"", 'not', 'expert', 'ballet', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'technical', 'names', 'moves', 'how', 'steps', 'should', 'be', 'executed', 'do', 'however', 'know', 'when', 'hear', 'music', 'soul', 'moves', 'tears', 'something', 'magical', 'happening', 'saw', 'such', 'beauty', 'passion', 'leading', 'characters', 'felt', 'blessed', 'have', 'stummbled', 'ballet', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'TV', 'screen.Lis', 'Jeppesen', 'so', 'graceful', 'had', 'watch', 'story', 'second', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'had', 'share', 'immediately', 'ordered', 'sent', 'parents', 'knew', 'would', 'appreciate', 'even', 'more', 'father', 'German', 'Opera', 'ballet', 'classical', 'music', 'mother', 'used', 'dance', 'ballet', 'when', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'Mom', 'called', 'Dad', 'watched', 'were', 'very', 'impressed.I', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'story', 'was', 'easy', 'follow', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'tragic', 'tale', 'man', 'be', 'married', 'love', 'fairy', 'intense', 'love', 'tears']",N/A

But in the end, I found the Royal Danish version a lot more satisfying.The first Act seemed a lot more authentic to me and I loved the mime. The dancers are all very good, and I actually liked the male lead better than the French one.Also the witch in this version is played by a woman, Sorella Englund, and she does a fantastic job. This is not a comic role which might be made funnier by a male impersonating a female, it's a tragic one, and requires a serioud interpretation, not a clownish one.Apart from all that, the music in the Danish version is far more enjoyable.I love this DVD and I have watched it several times.

197995,A3PQJ6J7FOOWFG,6300174816,"Dr. John W. Rippon ""May 19, 1932 and still going""","[4, 4]","The ballet ""La Sylphide has had a most curious history. It was conceived and choreographed by the great ballet master Filippo Taglioni for what became the Paris Opera Ballet in 1832. The music was by J-M Schweizhoeffer, costumes by E. Lani and the star was his daughter Maria Taglioni. She was the first to dance ""en pointe"" and wear the Romantic Tutu by Lani. It was an immediate international success and for a few decades overshadowed all other ballets. The Danish dancer, August Bournonville who had partnered Maria Taglioni in Paris came back to Copenhagen and wanted to stage La Syphide. However the fee for using the music parts and choreography of the Paris La Sylphide was so high that he decided to do a ""home grown"" version. He had the Court Composer, B. Herman S. Lovenskiold  render a new musical score and as choreographer and male lead he gave his James more to do and enhanced the other charachters. The Sylph was danced by his student and great ballerina Lucile Grahn. The premier was Nov. 28, 1836. It was a great success and has been in the long-lived Danish company ever since. Whereas the the Paris Sylphide disappeared after a few decades, the Danish version has persisted not only in Denmark but in revivals world wide. Bournonville admired Maria Taglioni as the ideal of ballet, but his own development as a choreographer was more of a ""petit bourgeoise"" ideal with a warm, friendly, more folksy feeling to his scores. In his version the farmer neighbors that come in to celebrate the wedding and dance are in heel-shoes although the Sylphs dance en pointe. In the Paris version en pointe is the rule and the score is perhaps more ""sophisticated"" (music and choreography). During an American revival of both versions in the 1950s, I saw several productions of them both, including in the Bournonville Sylphide the greatest James Erik Bruhn.The present production to me is the ideal of the Bournonville opus. The Sylph of Lis Jeppesen is perfect. She is delicate, lovely and she really does seem like she can fly. The James of Nikolaj Hubbe is hansome, masculine and believeable entranced. The Effy, Gurn and Madge are also all excellent. The corps of Sylphs is well trained; beauty incarnate. Since this is a 1988 recording, it is a record of a great moment in Ballet.",5,A Great Past Moment in Ballet,1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,2292,"['ballet', 'La', 'Sylphide', 'had', 'most', 'curious', 'history', 'was', 'conceived', 'choreographed', 'great', 'ballet', 'master', 'Filippo', 'Taglioni', 'what', 'became', 'Paris', 'Opera', 'Ballet', '1832', 'music', 'was', 'J-M', 'Schweizhoeffer', 'costumes', 'E.', 'Lani', 'star', 'was', 'daughter', 'Maria', 'Taglioni', 'was', 'first', 'dance', 'en', 'pointe', 'wear', 'Romantic', 'Tutu', 'Lani', 'was', 'immediate', 'international', 'success', 'few', 'decades', 'other', 'ballets', 'Danish', 'dancer', 'August', 'Bournonville', 'who', 'had', 'partnered', 'Maria', 'Taglioni', 'Paris', 'came', 'back', 'Copenhagen', 'wanted', 'stage', 'La', 'Syphide', 'However', 'fee', 'using', 'music', 'parts', 'choreography', 'Paris', 'La', 'Sylphide', 'was', 'so', 'high', 'decided', 'do', 'home', 'grown', 'version', 'had', 'Court', 'Composer', 'B.', 'Herman', 'S.', 'Lovenskiold', 'render', 'new', 'musical', 'score', 'choreographer', 'male', 'lead', 'gave', 'James', 'more', 'do', 'enhanced', 'other', 'charachters', 'Sylph', 'was', 'danced', 'student', 'great', 'ballerina', 'Lucile', 'Grahn', 'premier', 'was', 'Nov.', '28', '1836', 'was', 'great', 'success', 'been', 'long-lived', 'Danish', 'company', 'ever', 'Paris', 'Sylphide', 'disappeared', 'few', 'decades', 'Danish', 'version', 'persisted', 'not', 'only', 'Denmark', 'revivals', 'world', 'wide', 'Bournonville', 'admired', 'Maria', 'Taglioni', 'ideal', 'ballet', 'own', 'development', 'choreographer', 'was', 'more', 'petit', 'bourgeoise', 'ideal', 'warm', 'friendly', 'more', 'folksy', 'feeling', 'scores', 'version', 'farmer', 'neighbors', 'come', 'celebrate', 'wedding', 'dance', 'are', 'heel-shoes', 'Sylphs', 'dance', 'en', 'pointe', 'Paris', 'version', 'en', 'pointe', 'rule', 'score', 'perhaps', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'music', 'choreography', 'American', 'revival', 'versions', '1950s', 'saw', 'several', 'productions', 'including', 'Bournonville', 'Sylphide', 'greatest', 'James', 'Erik', 'Bruhn.The', 'present', 'production', 'ideal', 'Bournonville', 'opus', 'Sylph', 'Lis', 'Jeppesen', 'perfect', 'delicate', 'lovely', 'really', 'seem', 'can', 'fly', 'James', 'Nikolaj', 'Hubbe', 'hansome', 'masculine', 'believeable', 'entranced', 'Effy', 'Gurn', 'Madge', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'corps', 'Sylphs', 'well', 'trained', 'beauty', 'incarnate', '1988', 'recording', 'record', 'great', 'moment', 'Ballet']",N/A
197996,A3TIL1PC2ZE97B,6300174816,J. M WILINSKY,"[23, 26]","The Royal Danish Ballet is one of the oldest continuously performing ballet companies in the world and the keeper of a very special ballet tradition all of their own.  Students of ballet will notice many Danish-isms in their dancing(I won't go into detail here).  This is a beautiful performance, very nicely captured on dvd. The sound and image are perfect.  We have had the French version on dvd for a while(see my review of it) and you might wonder how the two versions compare.  The French version is longer and the music and choreography are quite different.  The two scores are composed by different people.  The stories are essentially the same.  In the Danish version Gurn, Effy, and Madge, the witch, play a slightly bigger role, making a more significant appearance in the second act.  The Danes practically invented the use of ballet mime and we get a wonderful eyeful here.  The mime is done so beautifully that it is dancing in itself.  The Scottish women in the first act dance in character shoes, not on pointe, while in the French version all of the women are on pointe.  In both versions the entire productions are fantastic!As far as the story goes, James is about to marry Effy(and James's friend Gurn wishes it were he that would marry her). James is visited by a beautiful sylph(a fairy of the atmosphere) and becomes intrigued and preoccupied with her to the point that he forgets to attend his wedding.  He also gets on the bad side of Madge, the witch, and winds up with a completely broken heart, left with no love at all.  One question which comes to mind in this story is exactly what are we to think of James?  Is he bewitched?  Is he a cad?  Is he hypnotized?  It is hard to imagine why one would give up Effy(she is quite a catch!) for a fairy.If you like classical ballet, you can't get much more ""classy"" than this!",5,A Wonderful Classical Ballet In The Danish Tradition!,1144540800,"04 9, 2006",2006,1847,"['Royal', 'Danish', 'Ballet', 'one', 'oldest', 'continuously', 'performing', 'ballet', 'companies', 'world', 'keeper', 'very', 'special', 'ballet', 'tradition', 'own', 'Students', 'ballet', 'will', 'notice', 'many', 'Danish-isms', 'dancing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'here', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'very', 'nicely', 'captured', 'dvd', 'sound', 'image', 'are', 'perfect', 'have', 'had', 'French', 'version', 'dvd', 'while', 'see', 'review', 'might', 'wonder', 'how', 'two', 'versions', 'compare', 'French', 'version', 'longer', 'music', 'choreography', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'two', 'scores', 'are', 'composed', 'different', 'people', 'stories', 'are', 'essentially', 'same', 'Danish', 'version', 'Gurn', 'Effy', 'Madge', 'witch', 'play', 'slightly', 'bigger', 'role', 'making', 'more', 'significant', 'appearance', 'second', 'act', 'Danes', 'practically', 'invented', 'use', 'ballet', 'mime', 'get', 'wonderful', 'eyeful', 'here', 'mime', 'done', 'so', 'beautifully', 'dancing', 'Scottish', 'women', 'first', 'act', 'dance', 'character', 'shoes', 'not', 'pointe', 'French', 'version', 'women', 'are', 'pointe', 'versions', 'entire', 'productions', 'are', 'fantastic', 'As', 'far', 'story', 'James', 'marry', 'Effy', 'James', 'friend', 'Gurn', 'were', 'would', 'marry', 'James', 'visited', 'beautiful', 'sylph', 'fairy', 'atmosphere', 'intrigued', 'preoccupied', 'point', 'attend', 'wedding', 'also', 'bad', 'side', 'Madge', 'witch', 'up', 'completely', 'broken', 'heart', 'left', 'love', 'One', 'question', 'mind', 'story', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'think', 'James', 'bewitched', 'cad', 'hypnotized', 'hard', 'imagine', 'why', 'one', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'Effy', 'quite', 'catch', 'fairy.If', 'classical', 'ballet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'more', 'classy']",N/A

Bournonville created his version of the ballet in Copenhagen in 1836, four years after the premiere of the original ""Sylphide"" from Filippo Taglioni at the Paris Opera. While the Paris ""Sylphide"" disappeared from the repertory the Danish version was miraculously kept in performance until the present day.Recorded at the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen in 1988, this famous film has been available on laserdisc some ten years ago and its release in the DVD-format was long overdue. The staging by Henning Kronstam and Arlette Weinreich, based on the authoritative production of Hans Brenaa is nothing short of ideal, while the cast led by Lis Jeppesen (the Sylph of her generation), a youngish Nikolaj H&uuml;bbe (in his debut as James) and Sorella Englund as Madge, is simply outstanding. Supporting roles include Morten Munksdorf as Gurn, Ann-Kristin Hauge as Effy and Silja Schandorff as the leading sylph in Act 2.The video-transfer is excellent, the sound is simple stereo.

In my opinion, this rarely seen Taglioni/Schneitzhoeffer version of ""La Sylphide"" (a historic reconstruction adapted for the technical abilities of late-20th-century dancers) is better than the more frequently performed Bournonville/Lovenskjold interpretation (inexplicably, although this tape is of the former version, Amazon has it listed with the name ""Lovenskiold""). Unfortunately, the film is only available on VHS and is in bad need of restoration.
