Even if they're a complete hoax by bands of pranksters, that in itself is an amazing feat.  And the beauty of them seen from the air is astonishing.  And the fact they keep getting bigger and more complex is also amazing.  What's particularly striking in this DVD is the aerial photography juxtaposed with the on-the-ground footage.  Just by looking at it, you can see how impossible--both from an engineering standpoint and an organizational standpoint--it would be to do this so perfectly with explainable tools.  But is the Earth itself communicating with us?  That seems even more impossible.  People have come forward, saying they created these, but they never have evidence, and in this day of cell-phones and digital video cameras, this seems impossible.  A lot to ponder in this DVD.",4,Completely fascinating,1276214400,"06 11, 2010",2010,853,"['more', 'find', 'out', 'about', 'crop', 'more', 'amazed', 'am', 'Even', ""'re"", 'complete', 'hoax', 'bands', 'pranksters', 'amazing', 'feat', 'beauty', 'seen', 'air', 'astonishing', 'fact', 'keep', 'getting', 'bigger', 'more', 'complex', 'also', 'amazing', 'What', 'particularly', 'striking', 'DVD', 'aerial', 'photography', 'juxtaposed', 'on-the-ground', 'footage', 'Just', 'looking', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'impossible', 'engineering', 'standpoint', 'organizational', 'standpoint', 'would', 'be', 'do', 'so', 'perfectly', 'explainable', 'tools', 'Earth', 'communicating', 'even', 'more', 'impossible', 'People', 'have', 'come', 'forward', 'saying', 'created', 'never', 'have', 'evidence', 'day', 'cell-phones', 'digital', 'video', 'cameras', 'impossible', 'lot', 'ponder', 'DVD']",Crop Circles - The Enigma

The things these people have to say...it's just so amazing! Crop circles are clearly a form of communication. I believe that people are so drawn to them because they feel the need to communicate with those that created them. I feel like this DVD brought me closer to knowing who or what they may be, & just seeing the people that have experienced them makes me feel more connected than before",4,k7,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,513,"['stunning', 'visual', 'tour', 'various', 'crop', 'circle', 'sights', 'very', 'interesting', 'interviews', 'people', 'connected', 'things', 'people', 'have', 'say', 'just', 'so', 'amazing', 'Crop', 'circles', 'are', 'clearly', 'form', 'communication', 'believe', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'drawn', 'feel', 'need', 'communicate', 'created', 'feel', 'DVD', 'brought', 'closer', 'knowing', 'who', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'seeing', 'people', 'have', 'experienced', 'feel', 'more', 'connected']",Crop Circles - The Enigma

I used to just write them off as clear pranks or silliness but I am not so sure anymore.  The complexities of some of the designs and stories people told of circles that clearly were created in less time than humanly possible leave me baffled.  Who is doing this and why???  It is difficult to refute that something strange is happening.  Very informative while entertaining.
