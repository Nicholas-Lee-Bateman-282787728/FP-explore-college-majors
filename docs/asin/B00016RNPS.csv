794380,A2ZT4L7BIUM4R2,B00016RNPS,"Arthur W. Scholbe ""awscho""","[1, 1]","First off, I liked this movie, although I agree with everything the other viewer said.  The movie starts off fantastically well. Andy Lau (Big) and Cecilia Cheung (Lee Fung Yee) have great chemistry, and the special effects are very well done.  It's a lot of fun all around.  Then, in the last Act, everything comes to a head as Lee goes looking for Sun Ko, who murdered Big's friend Jade, is killed by him, on that same mountain where he killed Jade.Big had been a monk and left the Temple (at the foot of the mountain) after Jade was killed when, in a frustrated rage, he (Big) had killed a sparrow and been endowed with an ability to see Karma. Now, he was back on the mountain seeking revenge.  He ends up chasing Sun Ko back to a sacred cave with obscure graffitti on the walls and buddhist statuary around its external perimeter.  Here he finds that he has been chasing his own karmic self and, if he didn't come to grips with it, he was doomed to creating a cycle of death and revenge (which was the motivation behind the first murder which brought Big and Lee together).If looked on in that light, the ending becomes sadly poetic as Big accepts the deaths of Jade and Lee as part of their karma, dons the old robes he had discarded on the mountain five years previously and continues his search.  Now, however, when he and Sun Ko meet (after another 5 years), instead of revenge, there is compassion and the karmic imbalance is resolved.Like I said, I liked this movie.  Although, like the other reviewer, I too would have wished for a sweeter ending for Lee and Big.",4,Point of view,1079308800,"03 15, 2004",2004,1575,"['First', 'liked', 'movie', 'agree', 'everything', 'other', 'viewer', 'said', 'movie', 'fantastically', 'well', 'Andy', 'Lau', 'Big', 'Cecilia', 'Cheung', 'Lee', 'Fung', 'Yee', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'lot', 'fun', 'around', 'Then', 'last', 'Act', 'everything', 'head', 'Lee', 'looking', 'Sun', 'Ko', 'who', 'murdered', 'Big', 'friend', 'Jade', 'killed', 'same', 'mountain', 'where', 'killed', 'Jade.Big', 'had', 'been', 'monk', 'left', 'Temple', 'foot', 'mountain', 'Jade', 'was', 'killed', 'when', 'frustrated', 'rage', 'Big', 'had', 'killed', 'sparrow', 'been', 'endowed', 'ability', 'see', 'Karma', 'Now', 'was', 'back', 'mountain', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'up', 'chasing', 'Sun', 'Ko', 'back', 'sacred', 'cave', 'obscure', 'graffitti', 'walls', 'buddhist', 'statuary', 'external', 'perimeter', 'Here', 'been', 'chasing', 'own', 'karmic', 'self', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'grips', 'was', 'doomed', 'creating', 'cycle', 'death', 'revenge', 'was', 'motivation', 'first', 'murder', 'brought', 'Big', 'Lee', 'together', '.If', 'looked', 'light', 'ending', 'becomes', 'sadly', 'poetic', 'Big', 'deaths', 'Jade', 'Lee', 'part', 'karma', 'old', 'robes', 'had', 'discarded', 'mountain', 'five', 'years', 'previously', 'search', 'Now', 'however', 'when', 'Sun', 'Ko', 'meet', '5', 'years', 'instead', 'revenge', 'compassion', 'karmic', 'imbalance', 'resolved.Like', 'said', 'liked', 'movie', 'other', 'reviewer', 'too', 'would', 'have', 'wished', 'sweeter', 'ending', 'Lee', 'Big']",N/A

794384,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B00016RNPS,Ernest Jagger,"[11, 11]","""Running On Karma,"" has to be one of the most entertaining films that I have seen in a long time. I truly enjoyed this film, and highly recommend it to everyone. Not only is this film very entertaining, but there are an equal amount of funny scenes in this film as well as tragic. The film stars a character by the name of Biggie (Andy Lau) as an ex-shaolin monk with Karmic visions. Biggie gets his name due to the fact that he is a body building wrestler and strip dancer, with huge muscles. However, there is more to Biggie than meets the eye. Not only does he wrestle for a living and do strip dancing, but as an ex-shaolin monk, he has the ability to see other peoples karma. This ability to see other peoples karma, is one of the reasons he left his life as a monk. Yet, there is more to this than I wish to divulge.The viewer is introduced to Biggie in the films introduction. As he is doing a strip tease dance in a club, he is arrested by an undercover policewoman (Cecelia Cheung) for violating decency laws. However, this crossing of paths between these to characters will have a profound impact on the both of them. One side note quickly on the character of Andy Lau in the film. One sees a large and heavily muscled body builder, and this was due to the special effects department that incorporated a muscle suit for Biggie to wear. And I believe for the film, they did a good job. Moreover, it was necessary for what will eventually occur toward the end of the film. As one sees a transformation in his character.Furthermore, Andy Lau sure played the character of Biggie in a very funny, witty, and serious way. His character alone was a true joy to watch. Now, one more thing. 'Suspension of Disbelief' is a necessary ingredient for many films. Look at ""Lord of the Rings."" For the viewer to appreciate and enjoy this delightful film, put aside any Westernized or preconceived ideas of life in the hereafter. Just for the pure value of entertainment, take the film with a grain of salt. The film's main premise is that past mistakes affect our present state of affairs. If you did harm in your past life, you will suffer the consequences in this life. And when Biggie (Andy Lau) meets up with this policewoman, (Cecelia Cheung) he sees visions of her past life.But what does Biggie see in this policewoman's past life that bothers him? Is there something in her past that caused others to suffer? And if so, what was it? The films narrative follows Biggie as he tries to reverse this policewoman's Karma, by interfering with her life in order to protect her. And in doing so, something occurs that gives Biggie hope. Or can her Karma be reversed? She is in love with him, but he is also unsure whether or not he can help her. Can he help her? Or is her fate sealed? Maybe his actions will alter her life? Then maybe not? There are some very good action scenes in the film, not only with Biggie (Andy Lau) but with other strange characters in the film as well. Plus, the way the films narrative evolves is very interesting and you find yourself drawn into ALL characters in the film. This film really works. I think you will enjoy this film---I sure did. Give the film a chance and I think you will like it. It truly is a different kind of film than what one is usually used to.

794385,A2B0XO8BTPRX7R,B00016RNPS,Ian Vance,"[35, 35]","While browsing through MidnightEye.com's best-of-2004 for Netflix recommendations, I chanced upon an entry regarding *Running on Karma,* a new film starring Andy Lau as an ex-Shaolin monk turned bodybuilder/stripper and karmic visionary.  The premise sounded outrageously appealing, and the review suggested that the film contained a meditative subtext on the title-subject, so I instantly added it to my queue and, a few days later, settled down for a screening of this surreal, genre-defying little gem.  Two hours later I emerged from the experience in a wholly different frame of mind, unsure of the film as a whole but certainly ~moved~, shaken up in a way that many films attempt - and usually fail - to achieve.It's impossible to categorize *Running on Karma*.  The film begins in ridiculously sleazy circumstances, segues into a murder mystery, shifts to romantic-comedy terrain, then enters into the philosophical sphere for the third act, a brain-bender sequence compounded by the undercurrent tragic nature of *Karma's* theme.  I had some problems with this theme (see below), but overall the ease and control the filmmakers exerted over their content - especially content so borderline-bizarre and convoluted as this - made the film extremely enjoyable and refreshingly unpredictable.Hong Kong heartthrob & box-office gold Andy Lau (*Infernal Affairs*, *House of Flying Daggers*) plays Biggie, a former monk who has abandoned his vows for a life of weight-lifting, wenching, drink and other debauched activities; moreover, he can somehow see the impending karma of those whose life is about to expire.  Even swaddled in an obviously-fake muscle-suit (though it does come off more convincing than, say, *Hellboy*), Lau is effortlessly charming and sells the performance on sheer charisma alone - after awhile, one ignores the foam-creases etc. and allows suspension of disbelief to creep on in and take residence.(SPOILERS: The muscle-suit ~does~ have an integral role to play, as well, for it represents the over-development of the ineffectual ego-aspect; when Biggie has reached transcendence, the bulk is shed before aesthetic leanness.  But I'm getting ahead of myself...)After getting busted in a strip club, Biggie meets Lee (Cecilia Cheung), a police woman whose main role in this film is to be as cute as possible (success!); he subsequently helps her work on a murder-mystery featuring dueling yoga masters engaged in a feud that extends back centuries.  In a typical thriller, this murder-mystery would occupy most of the running time and climax with the usual nail-biting complications; in *Karma* it is solved before the halfway mark (!) and the romantic comedy aspects then dominate, as Lee falls hard for Biggie, investigating his past and, yes, being as cute as possible to draw his attention.  Unfortunately she has already attracted his third eye attention: Biggie can see a miasma-shroud of disastrous consequences swarming about her shoulders, and he futilely resists the pangs of love against this harrowing vision of past-life crimes.Enough of the basics.  I'm not going to spoil the more overt aspects of the ending, but I do wish to comment on the use of religious/philosophical themes.  Now, karma is one of the most misunderstood phrases of Eastern Philosophy: in the west it is generally associated with ""what you do now will come back to you later"", which is actually ~dharma~; ~karma~ refers to ""what you did in a previous life effects your life now, and what you do in this life will effect your future lives.""  This misapplication of Hindu terminology is prevalent to the western mass consciousness and is a mistake doubtful to be rectified anytime soon, for no other reason that that 'karma' is the catchier word...  Semantics aside, I had a conflictive issue with, yet admiration of, the rigid/fluid incorporation of karma in this film.  My admiration stemmed the surreal construction of the third act as a whole and the pivotal decision of Biggie therein; my issues are seated in the deeper understanding of how karma has been corrupted - as all ""holy doctrines"", regardless of culture or theism, are eventually corrupted by man.  For in certain Asian countries/cultures, the highest honor on the wheel of karma is to be born a man; women are relegated to the second-or-third tier status, in the same league as dogs or pigs.  Naturally this is used to re-enforce patriarchal social-structures and to preserve the necessary evils inherent to humanity - sex slaves and prostitutes, beggars and landmine victims, the downtrodden and poverty-stricken - the plight of these awful existences is found fault in the actions of a previous life; the only course for the damned and destitute is to be humble and charitable in their fate-chosen place, and hopefully move up the ladder or overcome completely the cycle of karma upon death.  In other words, karma is used as a ""divine mandate"" for man's tendency toward pecking-order social pyramids; it's control-oriented balderdash used to exploit, a corruption as pernicious as the original sin guilt-complex endemic to Catholicism.  Having seen up close and personal the ramifications of this comfort-zone integration in SE Asia, I was conflicted by *Running on Karma's* ~initial~ literal interpretation of this quandary, yet still moved by the resultant denouement as Biggie transcends his murderous intent towards Sun Ko, striding away from the cycle of karma with a cigarette in hand.One of the most unusual and original films I've seen to date, *Running on Karma* merits four  stars and my highest recommendations.

794386,A1OEKU0BVKLMHG,B00016RNPS,"Sharon Shurley ""Feekie""","[1, 3]","First let me say, this is basically not a terrible story.  The ideas portrayed are interesting.  To be sure, karma is always interesting.  I understood the premise.  I understood (I think) the ending.  What I didn't understand was the ridiculous foam rubber bodybuilding ""suit"" Andy Lau was forced to wear.  Oh, I cringe at how he must have felt!  There were many other viable alternatives that could have been employed to show Andy's transcendental journey.  Who is responsible for this unforgiveable lapse in judgment?  I had the feeling the person who came up with this silly idea must have been having his own out of body experience.  The whole movie is good -- except for the suit.  What makes it worse is that the viewer can never forget that it IS a suit!  Andy's head is too small to go with the rest of his body, and the foam rubber muscles bend and are not realistic.  Andy Lau did a tremendous job of portraying this character (despite this awful suit) and the other actors were good as well.  It could have been a 5-star movie all the way -- except for the suit.  Still, Andy Lau fans should not pass this one by.  It's not Andy's fault.  If you're not an Andy fan, I hate to say this, but I can't recommend it.  It's just too ridiculous -- the suit, that is!  Can you tell the suit really ruined it for me??",3,Bodybuilding Stripper Monk!,1191801600,"10 8, 2007",2007,1320,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'basically', 'not', 'terrible', 'story', 'ideas', 'portrayed', 'are', 'interesting', 'be', 'sure', 'always', 'interesting', 'understood', 'premise', 'understood', 'think', 'ending', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'foam', 'rubber', 'bodybuilding', 'suit', 'Andy', 'Lau', 'was', 'forced', 'wear', 'Oh', 'cringe', 'how', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'were', 'many', 'other', 'viable', 'alternatives', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'employed', 'show', 'Andy', 'transcendental', 'journey', 'Who', 'responsible', 'unforgiveable', 'lapse', 'judgment', 'had', 'feeling', 'person', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'silly', 'idea', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'having', 'own', 'out', 'body', 'experience', 'whole', 'movie', 'good', 'suit', 'What', 'worse', 'viewer', 'can', 'never', 'forget', 'suit', 'Andy', 'head', 'too', 'small', 'go', 'rest', 'body', 'foam', 'rubber', 'muscles', 'bend', 'are', 'not', 'realistic', 'Andy', 'Lau', 'did', 'tremendous', 'job', 'portraying', 'character', 'awful', 'suit', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'been', '5-star', 'movie', 'way', 'suit', 'Still', 'Andy', 'Lau', 'fans', 'should', 'not', 'pass', 'one', 'not', 'Andy', 'fault', ""'re"", 'not', 'Andy', 'fan', 'hate', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'just', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'suit', 'Can', 'tell', 'suit', 'really', 'ruined']",N/A
794387,A3PZ0H4BMZOFRT,B00016RNPS,ShowBizBuff,"[0, 0]","Andy Lau, for years, has been one of the best (and most underrated, at least outside Asia) actors working today.  Here, he plays Biggie, a former monk who left the order some years ago and now is a huge slab of beefcake working as a professional stripper (indeed, throughout the vast majority of the film Lau wears a full rubber suit that bulks him up to twice his size; a rubber suit that is surprisingly convincing, even in a few scenes where Lau appears ""nude"").  Other than dancing and an amazing physique, Biggie can also see other people's karma - and when he is able to tell that a pretty young policewoman, who is actually investigating him, is going to be murdered in the near future, he starts to hang around her to prevent her death ... and inadvertently ends up helping her with some of her cases.  But the film, two-thirds of the way in, turns into a series tale of both karma and Zen, going much deeper than you'd think (pay attention!) in revealing more of Biggie's past and - indeed - his future.  Engage your brain, really watch and think, and you'll appreciate just how truly deep this sweet little film is.",4,"Karma, Zen, a convincing rubber suit, and Andy Lau - and it all works!",1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,1125,"['Andy', 'Lau', 'years', 'been', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'underrated', 'least', 'outside', 'Asia', 'actors', 'working', 'today', 'Here', 'Biggie', 'former', 'monk', 'who', 'left', 'order', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'huge', 'slab', 'beefcake', 'working', 'professional', 'stripper', 'indeed', 'vast', 'majority', 'film', 'Lau', 'full', 'rubber', 'suit', 'up', 'twice', 'size', 'rubber', 'suit', 'surprisingly', 'convincing', 'even', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'Lau', 'nude', 'Other', 'dancing', 'amazing', 'physique', 'Biggie', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'other', 'people', 'karma', 'when', 'able', 'tell', 'pretty', 'young', 'policewoman', 'who', 'actually', 'investigating', 'going', 'be', 'murdered', 'near', 'future', 'hang', 'around', 'prevent', 'death', 'inadvertently', 'up', 'helping', 'cases', 'film', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'series', 'tale', 'karma', 'Zen', 'going', 'much', 'deeper', ""'d"", 'think', 'pay', 'attention', 'revealing', 'more', 'Biggie', 'past', 'indeed', 'future', 'Engage', 'brain', 'really', 'watch', 'think', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'just', 'how', 'truly', 'deep', 'sweet', 'little', 'film']",N/A

Or at least for the first two thirds, before it takes a surprisingly sharp U-turn into philosophical and tragic territory as the two try to reverse their bad karma in different but equally drastic ways. Much of the credit here has to go to Ka-Fei Wei, who also wrote as well as co-directed, but it's certainly a much more impressive collaboration than the disappointing Fulltime Killer. Lau is extremely good, the premise works much better than it should and most importantly, you get to care about the characters.
