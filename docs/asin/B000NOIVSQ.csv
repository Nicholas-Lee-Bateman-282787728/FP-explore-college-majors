I've been a fan of Kurupt ever since The Chronic from Dr Dre and it comes as no surprise that the main reason this film is good is because of Kurupt. Of course being that I am also a fan of wrestling and liked all his other work in film Bill Goldberg was also a nice addition.The story in this film takes place some time after the first picking up with Twitch, and apparently the gold found at the end of the first film was not all of it. It also seems that Twitch [Kurupt] is not the only one that knows where the rest of it is. The problem is that the other inmate gets out in a month, so Twitch purposely gets into a fight to be sent to another prison closer to the gold. It is here that he meets fellow inmate Burke [Goldberg] and an all black gang led by Angel that forces him to join them. Turns out that the day Twitch's girl and Burke's daughter come to visit a riot breaks out in the prison, leaving the girls held hostage by another inmate who also set up Burke for a murder. So it seems are two heroes have to come together [not that Burke wants Twitch there] to save the girls. This scenario leads to all kinds of situations that the two have to over come, most of which are funny thanks to Twitch. After a gang of fights, shots, and situations the two prevail and save the girls. This leads to Twitch getting paroled and being able to go get the gold, and like the first film ends with a visit to the prison and a funny closing scene involving Twitch and his girl.Director Art Camacho does a good job with this sequel to the Steven Seagal film his direction was well rounded and shows that he did what he could with an obvious lower budget then the first film. Writer D. Kyle Johnson wrote a decent script and played off the first film pretty well, I just wish he would have added more humor to the film with Kurupt's character. Executive producer Andrew Stevens, who also co wrote this, returns as a producer from the first film. He is joined by producers William B. Steakley, and Jason DeBouse who served as Producer [Steakley] and associate producer [DeBouse].Acting wise this film is actually pretty good, a lot better then I thought it would be. Of course I knew Kurupt would be excellent in reprising his role as Twitch from the first film. Kurupt who has proven himself as an actor by his various roles in different films shines as Twitch who is the obvious comic relief, his facial expressions are priceless. You should check Kurupt out in ""Brothers in Arms"" to see his dramatic acting. Kurupt ain't the only one who does a good job in this film. Bill Goldberg did a nice job in this film as well; he is very believable in the role of Burke. Goldberg who really impressed me as the over the top killer in ""Santa's Slay"". Angell Conwell as Twitch's girl is great and is very believable as Twitch's new girl friend. Alona Tal as well is good in her role of Burke's daughter, although she does seem like the least experienced of the group as far as acting. Everybody else in the film are just as good as the others above, everyone basically does what they can with this film.Over all this film is pretty good and a worthy addition to any one's collection, it's perfect for a day off from work or a rainy day.  Kurupt definitely is the reason to watch this film, any one who is a fan of Kurupt or Goldberg will definitely want this.",5,KURUPT,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,3467,"['HALF', 'PAST', 'DEAD', '2I', 'am', 'sure', 'everybody', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'exactly', 'why', 'got', 'film', 'KURUPT', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Kurupt', 'ever', 'Chronic', 'Dr', 'Dre', 'surprise', 'main', 'reason', 'film', 'good', 'Kurupt', 'course', 'being', 'am', 'also', 'fan', 'wrestling', 'liked', 'other', 'work', 'film', 'Bill', 'Goldberg', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'addition.The', 'story', 'film', 'place', 'time', 'first', 'picking', 'up', 'Twitch', 'apparently', 'gold', 'found', 'end', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'also', 'Twitch', '[', 'Kurupt', ']', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'where', 'rest', 'problem', 'other', 'inmate', 'out', 'month', 'so', 'Twitch', 'purposely', 'fight', 'be', 'sent', 'prison', 'closer', 'gold', 'here', 'fellow', 'inmate', 'Burke', '[', 'Goldberg', ']', 'black', 'gang', 'led', 'Angel', 'join', 'out', 'day', 'Twitch', 'girl', 'Burke', 'daughter', 'come', 'visit', 'riot', 'out', 'prison', 'leaving', 'girls', 'held', 'hostage', 'inmate', 'who', 'also', 'set', 'up', 'Burke', 'murder', 'are', 'two', 'heroes', 'have', 'come', 'together', '[', 'not', 'Burke', 'Twitch', 'save', 'girls', 'scenario', 'kinds', 'situations', 'two', 'have', 'come', 'most', 'are', 'funny', 'thanks', 'Twitch', 'gang', 'fights', 'shots', 'situations', 'two', 'prevail', 'save', 'girls', 'Twitch', 'getting', 'paroled', 'being', 'able', 'go', 'get', 'gold', 'first', 'film', 'visit', 'prison', 'funny', 'closing', 'scene', 'involving', 'Twitch', 'girl.Director', 'Art', 'Camacho', 'good', 'job', 'sequel', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'film', 'direction', 'was', 'well', 'rounded', 'did', 'what', 'could', 'obvious', 'lower', 'budget', 'then', 'first', 'film', 'Writer', 'D.', 'Kyle', 'Johnson', 'wrote', 'decent', 'script', 'played', 'off', 'first', 'film', 'pretty', 'well', 'just', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'more', 'humor', 'film', 'Kurupt', 'character', 'Executive', 'producer', 'Andrew', 'Stevens', 'who', 'also', 'co', 'wrote', 'producer', 'first', 'film', 'joined', 'producers', 'William', 'B.', 'Steakley', 'Jason', 'DeBouse', 'who', 'served', 'Producer', '[', 'Steakley', ']', 'associate', 'producer', '[', 'DeBouse', ']', '.Acting', 'wise', 'film', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'lot', 'better', 'then', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'course', 'knew', 'Kurupt', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'reprising', 'role', 'Twitch', 'first', 'film', 'Kurupt', 'who', 'proven', 'actor', 'various', 'roles', 'different', 'films', 'shines', 'Twitch', 'who', 'obvious', 'comic', 'relief', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'priceless', 'should', 'check', 'Kurupt', 'out', 'Brothers', 'Arms', 'see', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'Kurupt', 'ai', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'who', 'good', 'job', 'film', 'Bill', 'Goldberg', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'believable', 'role', 'Burke', 'Goldberg', 'who', 'really', 'impressed', 'top', 'killer', 'Santa', 'Slay', 'Angell', 'Conwell', 'Twitch', 'girl', 'great', 'very', 'believable', 'Twitch', 'new', 'girl', 'friend', 'Alona', 'Tal', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'role', 'Burke', 'daughter', 'seem', 'least', 'experienced', 'group', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'Everybody', 'else', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'others', 'everyone', 'basically', 'what', 'can', 'film.Over', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'worthy', 'addition', 'one', 'collection', 'perfect', 'day', 'work', 'rainy', 'day', 'Kurupt', 'definitely', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'one', 'who', 'fan', 'Kurupt', 'Goldberg', 'will', 'definitely', 'want']",N/A

I came in with low expectations and this was way below my low expectations.Plot: Dont even kid yourself.Opinion: At least Half Past Dead had an idea. The idea sucked and so did the movie but at least it had an idea. Half Past Dead 2 is some rival inmates fight, one of them gets a gun(Dont ask me how because I wouldnt know what to tell you), shoots an inmate and a riot breaks loose in the prison. The main shooter is some guy called Cortez who is trying to break out of prison. During a conjugal visit, the riots break out and Cortez holds both Twitch(who is played by Kurupt of the Dogg Pound)'s fiancee'(Angell Conwell) and Burke(played by the wrestler Bill Goldberg)'s daughter are held hostage. Both Twitch and Burke try to find them while getting into skirmishes with idiotic inmates. The main problem with this movie besides the weak plot and script is that NOBODY takes themselves seriously. Nobody puts any effort into their character. If they would have overacted I would have respected that more than people who act as if they are robots reading their lines off a cue card. I have more respect for people who chew up scenery like locusts. At least they're trying. Nobody tries to act here. Everybody is a caricature. Bill Goldberg spends most of his time sulking and looking constipated and Kurupt's character is such a wuss in this movie. Every other minute he is either getting jacked up by an inmate and waiting for Burke to save him or he was getting jacked up by Burke. I dont see how anybody could like his role in this movie when all he did was act like some soft minstrel clown. The rest of the inmates are stereotypical characters you see in every jail movie. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed and sluggish. I like Goldberg as a wrestler and I liked Kurupt before he switched his style up but this movie stinks!

1058170,A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP,B000NOIVSQ,"Sebastian Sanjurjo ""mr.movie expert""","[1, 2]","While taking a walk down the isle of my local video store I decided to take a look at the new release section, to my surprise I saw laying there a copy of ""Half Past Dead 2. The first thought that came to my mind was ""When did this come out? Was this even in theaters? Also why make a sequel to a movie that wasn't good in the first place?"" all these questions arose in mater of seconds. But curiosity killed me and a decided to give this movie a shot.One thing you should know is that this movie is not with Steven Seagal, and in my opinion that is what makes the movie better. For those who are unfamiliar with the plot of the first movie it's about some dudes that decide to brake in to a newly reopened Alcatraz, inside they will find an inmate that has the location of a lot of money in gold brick. The inmates decide to fight back against the criminals that are breaking in..Ironic isn't? Anyhow this sequel continues in a sort of linear but independent story that impressively connects with the first movie. The only actors that reprise their roles from the first film here are Kurupt who plays Twitch, and Tony Plana who plays El Fuego. Twicth in this movie like the first is doing time in Alcatraz; he decides to cause trouble so he can be moved to a higher security prison that is not surrounded by water.After he gets transferred to the other prison he gets caught in between a gang war that gets out of control. Bill Goldberg's character gets blamed for something he didn't do, the whole prison gets taken over by the prisoners, and Goldberg's daughter is being held captive by one of the inmates. Well I don't want to ruin anything else but this movie is pretty good, in a guilty pleasure sense. The director managed to use flashback from the first movie to tie it in with this one, and it works perfectly. I recommend you rent if you want to watch a guilty pleasure.MY PERSONAL RATING: 3  OUT OF 5",4,An Unnecessary Sequel That Proves Itself To Be Necessary,1218326400,"08 10, 2008",2008,1911,"['taking', 'walk', 'isle', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'decided', 'take', 'look', 'new', 'release', 'section', 'surprise', 'saw', 'laying', 'there', 'copy', 'Half', 'Past', 'Dead', '2', 'first', 'thought', 'came', 'mind', 'was', 'When', 'did', 'come', 'out', 'even', 'theaters', 'Also', 'why', 'make', 'sequel', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'first', 'place', 'questions', 'arose', 'mater', 'seconds', 'curiosity', 'killed', 'decided', 'give', 'movie', 'shot.One', 'thing', 'should', 'know', 'movie', 'not', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'opinion', 'movie', 'better', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'plot', 'first', 'movie', 'dudes', 'decide', 'brake', 'newly', 'reopened', 'Alcatraz', 'will', 'find', 'inmate', 'location', 'lot', 'money', 'gold', 'brick', 'inmates', 'decide', 'fight', 'back', 'criminals', 'are', 'breaking', 'in..Ironic', ""n't"", 'Anyhow', 'sequel', 'sort', 'linear', 'independent', 'story', 'impressively', 'first', 'movie', 'only', 'actors', 'reprise', 'roles', 'first', 'film', 'here', 'are', 'Kurupt', 'who', 'Twitch', 'Tony', 'Plana', 'who', 'El', 'Fuego', 'Twicth', 'movie', 'first', 'doing', 'time', 'Alcatraz', 'cause', 'trouble', 'can', 'be', 'moved', 'higher', 'security', 'prison', 'not', 'surrounded', 'water.After', 'transferred', 'other', 'prison', 'caught', 'gang', 'war', 'control', 'Bill', 'Goldberg', 'character', 'blamed', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'prison', 'taken', 'over', 'prisoners', 'Goldberg', 'daughter', 'being', 'held', 'captive', 'one', 'inmates', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'anything', 'else', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'sense', 'director', 'managed', 'use', 'flashback', 'first', 'movie', 'tie', 'one', 'perfectly', 'recommend', 'rent', 'want', 'watch', 'guilty', 'pleasure.MY', 'PERSONAL', 'RATING', '3', 'OUT', '5']",N/A
