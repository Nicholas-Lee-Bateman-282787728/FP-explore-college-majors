It has a white background with very bright colour characters and good patterns of behaviour and language learning.It revolves around the baby Pocoyo, (Ms) Elly the pink Elephant, Loula the Dog, the always-cool Pato the duck, and sleepy bird.The hallmark of any good children's product is being able to appeal to the adults. This is amusing enough that you will enjoy watching it with your child, even the 10th time.

I hate the VOICE of the person narrating!! Why doesn't Pocoyo have his own voice?!

Now that he is going 15 months in June 30, 2011, he could watch and understand cartoons much better, all he's ever wanted is Pocoyo. Nothing seems to get his interests much, except Pocoyo. He can sit and watch Pocoyo the entire dvd in contrast to Mickey Mouse dvd.
