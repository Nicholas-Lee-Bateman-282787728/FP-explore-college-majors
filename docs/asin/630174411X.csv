Burchfield,"[0, 0]","I don't remember why now that I got my copy, but it isn't too bad for what I'd guess was a low budget 80's British comedy, Idle & Coltrane can put that out without even trying too hard. Some of the longer reviews have already given enough of a description of the basic details, even mentioning the possibility of offending, or not, Catholics.I still remember Robbie Coltrane &#34;crossing&#34; himself, no doubt that riles some people but then so would the idea of a couple of, so obviously, men being able to pass themselves off as women.No extras I think Amazon says but I remember something about some, I'm sure they were &#34;acting&#34;, retired nuns endorsing the movie. No one so far has mentioned the remarks Mother Superior made about the Convent keeping the briefcase full of cash I & C left behind in their hurry to escape, bet that offended some.Only one or two reviews mentioned the girl's shower scene in which Coltrane was watching over the girls, &#34;too shy&#34; to join them, he and Idle handled that well. Not sure what the point in the scene being in the movie was- PG-13 movie that I'm surprised didn't get an R for the amount of, non sexual, nudity.Not a great movie, it's been some time since I've watched my copy, but it has some humor to it.

The result is hilarious.The tough guys are two bit actors, completely unconvincing in their roles, especially the ones who play the Asian gang, but the movie is loaded with laughs, and improves with each viewing, as one picks up more and more of the subtlies perhaps missed the first time around.It's pretty much slapstick in parts, but there are some wonderfully rich and uproariously funny bits, such as when one of the ""sisters"" (Robbie Coltrane) has to supervise the girls shower; the scene where the non-Catholic ""nun"" (Eric Idle) has to give a class in Catechism about which he knows absolutely nothing and really messes up, will have every Catholic viewer rolling in the aisles, as is the part where he sneaks into the Confessional and pretends to be a priest in order to hear his girlfriend's confession.  Then, of course, there is Father Shamus, who has a bit of trouble keeping his hands to himself, and who tries his best to hit on one of the newly arrived ""nuns.""Except for the truly tacky and totally unconvincing ""gang"" members, the movie is a riot.

In the old days, crooks didn't carry guns and nobody ever got hurt. Now, they work for a young psycho who doesn't trust anybody. Bank robbers carry guns and guys who try to quit the gang disappear without a trace. When their boss sets up a caper to rob a rival gang (a Chinese bunch known as The Triads), Brian and Charlie decide to keep the loot for themselves and escape to Rio. Things get complicated, however, when they bungle the escape and find themselves hiding out in a convent. On top of that, Brian realizes he's in love with Faith, the extremely near-sighted waitress he's been dating.This movie is loaded with laughs. See Charlie and Brian, dressed as nuns, buying face powder and men's razors in the drug store across from the convent. Or there's Brian (Eric Idle) teaching a class on the &quot;Trinity&quot; (people have been arguing that one since the 4th century) in a classroom full of girl students (and they're not little girls). And, along with funny scenes, there are plenty of funny lines. The cast is good, too. Idle and Coltrane work nicely together and are very funny, the actress who plays Faith is delightfully ditzy until the chips are down, and there are some funny characters among the nuns, as well.&quot;Nuns On The Run&quot; won't go down as one of the funniest comedies on film, but it's better than average and has lots of laughs in it.

Robbie: Yes, plenty) , the film cant hide its British origins and has a very 80's feel.

Robbie Coltrane and Eric Idle will always be two of my favorites just because of this movie. It's just so silly, yet the serious side of what they are involved in, is hardly skipped over. After one of their 'partners in crime', a poor hapless little fellow named Norm, is eliminated by their horrible mob-boss, Casey, basically to teach Charlie (Coltrane) and Brian (Idle) a very hard lesson, the two very unhappy criminals set out to 'go straight'! Obviously, after that, hilarity ensues! After they end up in the convent, dressed as nuns, (which wouldn't fool anyone, I'm sure), Brian yells at Charlie-'You call this, going straight?'

The movie stars Eric Idle and Robbie Coltrane as two old time, small time crooks who want to get out of the business and go straight. However, the only way they can do so is by double crossing their boss and stealing two briefcases full of dough. They escape the crime scene by running into a nunnery and hide out there posing as two visiting nuns.Though both Idle and Coltrane are comic geniuses, there wit just doesn't flow in this dull and slow movie. Not only that, but the film is full of Catholic bashing and other than the few dead guy jokes and the cross dressing thieves, the only other humor comes at the expense of Christianity.I wanted this movie to end less than thirty minutes after it started, but it went on and on and on.
