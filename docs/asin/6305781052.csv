477491,A1NEO06KPX4VCC,6305781052,ADM,"[4, 5]","The tone of this film is pretty difficult to nail down. Some scenes are played to be genuinely touching, others seem purposefully maudlin, and still others are Jarmusch-like in their comedic detachment from the rest of  the movie.From scene to scene, you never really know where the movie is  trying to lead you from an emotional point of view, but you can usually see  where it's going plotwise: DeNiro's character (very) gradually learning to  accept Hoffman's, while a sleazy crimeboss tries to recover his  money.This movie is like two movies in one, and some viewers will like  one part of it, and others will prefer the other. The problem is that the  intertwining of these two &quot;separate&quot; movies does not necessarily  result in a single good movie.But maybe Joel Schumacher, the director,  was being more subtle than I am giving him credit for: maybe by mixing the  two genres of &quot;heart-wrenching melodrama&quot; with &quot;where's the  money&quot;, he was suggesting a parallel between his plot and his two main  characters, one a gun-toting former security guard, the other a drag queen.  Again, maybe that's reading too much into it, but it seems possible.A  lot of people seem not very impressed with DeNiro in this film. His  performance is, I guess, an average one, and maybe the fact that you don't  really expect &quot;just average&quot; from him is what makes it seem a  little worse than it is. He's certainly not difficult to watch, and I'm  sure he got the mannerisms of stroke victims just right, but there isn't a  lot of range or depth in his performance. (Perhaps that's impossible to  avoid? It's hard to say.)Phillip Seymour Hoffman, however, is amazing.  You can really appreciate his performance in this film if you've seen him  in something else: Magnolia, Happiness, or Boogie Nights, for example. He's  great in all of those, but his role in this film is in such stark contrast  to those other films that you can't help but be amazed by his range.  Compare the scenes in which he first takes on the thugs to the one where he  discusses a recently-deceased relative. He nails both of them, and keeps  his character consistent. You can't ask for more than that.Even though  the basic plot is outlandish, you can suspend your disbelief through most  of it, until the end, when it turns into Rear Window versus a cheap slasher  film. You'll see what I mean if you get that far.One other performance I  thought was excellent that nobody else has mentioned, was that of Daphne  Rubin-Vega, a Tony Award-nominated actress who is relatively new to movies.  Her role is small, but she owns it. Her shift from disenchantment to  enchantment is really a pleasure to watch. You see her whole story in her  face before she even says a word.Since this is a review of the DVD, I'll  just say that the picture quality is more than acceptable, and some of the  darker scenes look great. There are virtually no extras (just the trailer,  I think).So the bottom line: Is the film worth seeing? Sure, especially  if you're a PS Hoffman fan. But, be warned, you need to go with the flow  when it comes to the emotional tone of the film.",4,"Like Rear Window, except Grace Kelly is a drag queen!",957830400,"05 9, 2000",2000,3159,"['tone', 'film', 'pretty', 'difficult', 'nail', 'down', 'scenes', 'are', 'played', 'be', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'others', 'seem', 'purposefully', 'maudlin', 'still', 'others', 'are', 'Jarmusch-like', 'comedic', 'detachment', 'rest', 'movie.From', 'scene', 'scene', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'where', 'movie', 'trying', 'lead', 'emotional', 'point', 'view', 'can', 'usually', 'see', 'where', 'going', 'plotwise', 'DeNiro', 'character', 'very', 'gradually', 'learning', 'accept', 'Hoffman', 'sleazy', 'crimeboss', 'tries', 'recover', 'money.This', 'movie', 'two', 'movies', 'one', 'viewers', 'will', 'like', 'one', 'part', 'others', 'will', 'prefer', 'other', 'problem', 'intertwining', 'two', 'quot', 'separate', 'quot', 'movies', 'not', 'necessarily', 'result', 'single', 'good', 'movie.But', 'maybe', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'director', 'was', 'being', 'more', 'subtle', 'am', 'giving', 'credit', 'maybe', 'mixing', 'two', 'genres', 'quot', 'heart-wrenching', 'melodrama', 'quot', 'quot', 'where', 'money', 'quot', 'was', 'suggesting', 'parallel', 'plot', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'one', 'gun-toting', 'former', 'security', 'guard', 'other', 'drag', 'queen', 'Again', 'maybe', 'reading', 'too', 'much', 'possible.A', 'lot', 'people', 'seem', 'not', 'very', 'impressed', 'DeNiro', 'film', 'performance', 'guess', 'average', 'one', 'maybe', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'quot', 'just', 'average', 'quot', 'what', 'seem', 'little', 'worse', 'certainly', 'not', 'difficult', 'watch', ""'m"", 'sure', 'got', 'mannerisms', 'stroke', 'victims', 'just', 'right', ""n't"", 'lot', 'range', 'depth', 'performance', 'Perhaps', 'impossible', 'avoid', 'hard', 'say', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'however', 'amazing', 'can', 'really', 'appreciate', 'performance', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'something', 'else', 'Magnolia', 'Happiness', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'example', 'great', 'role', 'film', 'such', 'stark', 'contrast', 'other', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'amazed', 'range', 'Compare', 'scenes', 'first', 'thugs', 'one', 'where', 'recently-deceased', 'relative', 'character', 'consistent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ask', 'more', 'that.Even', 'basic', 'plot', 'outlandish', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'most', 'end', 'when', 'Rear', 'Window', 'cheap', 'slasher', 'film', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'get', 'far.One', 'other', 'performance', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'nobody', 'else', 'mentioned', 'was', 'Daphne', 'Rubin-Vega', 'Tony', 'Award-nominated', 'actress', 'who', 'relatively', 'new', 'movies', 'role', 'small', 'shift', 'disenchantment', 'enchantment', 'really', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'see', 'whole', 'story', 'face', 'even', 'word.Since', 'review', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'picture', 'quality', 'more', 'acceptable', 'darker', 'scenes', 'look', 'great', 'are', 'virtually', 'extras', 'just', 'trailer', 'think', '.So', 'bottom', 'line', 'film', 'seeing', 'Sure', 'especially', ""'re"", 'PS', 'Hoffman', 'fan', 'be', 'warned', 'need', 'go', 'flow', 'when', 'emotional', 'tone', 'film']",Flawless VHS
477492,A1LMBOI3T91P87,6305781052,Allan M. Lees,"[2, 2]","This is an atypical Hollywood movie in that the subject matter is far from the usual script-by-numbers routine, and the lead performances are without exception excellent.  DeNiro is particularly affecting as the ex-cop who suffers a stroke and must consequently struggle to rebuild his life. Being an American movie the script of course follows predictable character arcs and has exactly the kind of ""redemption"" storyline whereby we can accurately predict plot movements after the first fifteen minutes. There are no surprises, but the quality of the acting makes this a must-watch item. DeNiro is truly excellent with his under-stated performance and the direction is equally under-stated, which results in a well-paced unfolding of events.Being a Hollywood movie there of course has to be a love story sub-plot, and whereas the script was reasonably true to life with regards to the protagonist's development of friendships with his voice coach drag queen and his former colleagues, it's unrealistic from the moment when the ""hooker with the heart of gold"" imposes herself into his life. As the voice coach observes early in the movie, ""there's no romance without finance"" but according to Hollywood - and presumably based on countless viewer feedback surveys - we expect romance without finance and therefore that's what we'll get. Basically there's no escaping the Hollywood machine, but if you can ignore the contrived plot and the hackneyed themes, this is a great movie because of the riveting performances and the deftly handled direction.",4,Great Acting,1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,1548,"['atypical', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'subject', 'matter', 'far', 'usual', 'script-by-numbers', 'routine', 'lead', 'performances', 'are', 'exception', 'excellent', 'DeNiro', 'particularly', 'affecting', 'ex-cop', 'who', 'stroke', 'must', 'consequently', 'struggle', 'rebuild', 'life', 'Being', 'American', 'movie', 'script', 'course', 'predictable', 'character', 'arcs', 'exactly', 'kind', 'redemption', 'storyline', 'can', 'accurately', 'predict', 'plot', 'movements', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'are', 'surprises', 'quality', 'acting', 'must-watch', 'item', 'DeNiro', 'truly', 'excellent', 'under-stated', 'performance', 'direction', 'equally', 'under-stated', 'results', 'well-paced', 'unfolding', 'events.Being', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'there', 'course', 'be', 'love', 'story', 'sub-plot', 'script', 'was', 'reasonably', 'true', 'life', 'regards', 'protagonist', 'development', 'friendships', 'voice', 'coach', 'drag', 'queen', 'former', 'colleagues', 'unrealistic', 'moment', 'when', 'hooker', 'heart', 'gold', 'life', 'voice', 'coach', 'early', 'movie', 'romance', 'finance', 'according', 'Hollywood', 'presumably', 'based', 'countless', 'viewer', 'feedback', 'surveys', 'expect', 'romance', 'finance', 'therefore', 'what', ""'ll"", 'get', 'Basically', 'escaping', 'Hollywood', 'machine', 'can', 'ignore', 'contrived', 'plot', 'hackneyed', 'themes', 'great', 'movie', 'riveting', 'performances', 'deftly', 'handled', 'direction']",Flawless VHS
477493,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305781052,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","I say that for the sheer fact that I'm torn as to how I really feel about it.  The concept and the actual execution are far removed from one another and create a divided feeling.  I don't even know how to review this movie.  Where do I start?  The bad or the good?Eh, we'll start with the plot.  You have a homophobe who is rather rude and still seemingly suave or whatever named Walt.  He's an ex-cop, former hero, living in a slum-like apartment who sleeps with a whore although he considers her a lady and for some reason that validates him paying her for sex.  He lives in the same building as Rusty, a drag queen who does live performances with his friends and sings rather loudly and flamboyantly in his apartment.  When some thugs get their money stolen by some prostitutes who happen to live in Walt's apartment building, he tries to play hero and winds up having a stroke and is now paralyzed to an extent and needs therapy.  At wits end and near suicide, he concedes with therapeutic advice and decides to get singing lessons to help with his slurred speech.  Ashamed to have others see him, he asks Rusty for his help since he basically views Rusty as beneath him.  Rusty, saving for surgery to change him into a woman, needs to cash.  While they start off on odds, they form an odd friendship and both grow because of it.Yada-yada.Ok, so as a story, I like it.  It has a lot of promise, and parts of the script are really moving.  That said, the portrayal of Rusty and his drag queen friends is rather one-note and insulting and they convoluted gangster scenario leads to redundant sequences that take you out of the film.  The final action scene in particular is a mess and shouldn't have been in the film at all.  I also take issue with Philip Seymour Hoffman's atrocious performance.  I am a person who considers him one of our finest actors and have supported him for years despite accusations of him being a total ham on screen.  I love his 90's work and consider him to be a fantastic actor with under-appreciated range.  This particular performance is dreadful.  I mean, a true embarrassment.  His mannerisms are so clich&eacute; and over-exaggerated and his awful speech is beyond annoying.  I understand he is playing a character, but he came across as one who has no idea of how to play this character, and with Hoffman's obvious flamboyancy you'd think he would have nailed this one.  The script doesn't help much, since it gives Hoffman some of the worst dialog in screen history.Yet, I actually felt that Robert De Niro delivered a stunning performance that wasn't only technically great but one that was emotionally stirring, and he handles his arc to perfection.  He also isn't saddled with god-awful dialog, so that is a plus, but he also builds a character far more effectively than Hoffman.UGH, so I'm torn, but obviously leaning more on the side of `this film is a disaster' since outside of the concept and De Niro the film really is.  Leave it to Joel Schumacher to mess something like this up!",2,This is such a strange movie...,1345766400,"08 24, 2012",2012,3027,"['say', 'sheer', 'fact', ""'m"", 'torn', 'how', 'really', 'feel', 'concept', 'actual', 'execution', 'are', 'far', 'removed', 'one', 'create', 'divided', 'feeling', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'review', 'movie', 'Where', 'do', 'start', 'bad', 'good', 'Eh', ""'ll"", 'start', 'plot', 'have', 'homophobe', 'who', 'rather', 'rude', 'still', 'seemingly', 'suave', 'named', 'Walt', 'ex-cop', 'former', 'hero', 'living', 'slum-like', 'apartment', 'who', 'whore', 'lady', 'reason', 'paying', 'sex', 'same', 'building', 'Rusty', 'drag', 'queen', 'who', 'live', 'performances', 'friends', 'sings', 'rather', 'loudly', 'flamboyantly', 'apartment', 'When', 'thugs', 'get', 'money', 'stolen', 'prostitutes', 'who', 'happen', 'live', 'Walt', 'apartment', 'building', 'play', 'hero', 'up', 'having', 'stroke', 'now', 'paralyzed', 'extent', 'therapy', 'wits', 'end', 'suicide', 'therapeutic', 'advice', 'decides', 'get', 'singing', 'lessons', 'help', 'slurred', 'speech', 'Ashamed', 'have', 'others', 'see', 'Rusty', 'help', 'basically', 'Rusty', 'beneath', 'Rusty', 'saving', 'surgery', 'change', 'woman', 'cash', 'start', 'odds', 'form', 'odd', 'friendship', 'grow', 'it.Yada-yada.Ok', 'so', 'story', 'like', 'lot', 'promise', 'parts', 'script', 'are', 'really', 'moving', 'said', 'portrayal', 'Rusty', 'drag', 'queen', 'friends', 'rather', 'one-note', 'insulting', 'convoluted', 'gangster', 'scenario', 'redundant', 'sequences', 'take', 'film', 'final', 'action', 'scene', 'particular', 'mess', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'film', 'also', 'take', 'issue', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'atrocious', 'performance', 'am', 'person', 'who', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'have', 'supported', 'years', 'accusations', 'being', 'total', 'ham', 'screen', 'love', '90', 'work', 'consider', 'be', 'fantastic', 'actor', 'under-appreciated', 'range', 'particular', 'performance', 'dreadful', 'mean', 'true', 'embarrassment', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'so', 'clich', 'eacute', 'over-exaggerated', 'awful', 'speech', 'annoying', 'understand', 'playing', 'character', 'came', 'one', 'who', 'idea', 'how', 'play', 'character', 'Hoffman', 'obvious', 'flamboyancy', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'nailed', 'one', 'script', ""n't"", 'help', 'much', 'Hoffman', 'worst', 'dialog', 'screen', 'history.Yet', 'actually', 'felt', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'delivered', 'stunning', 'performance', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'technically', 'great', 'one', 'was', 'emotionally', 'stirring', 'arc', 'perfection', 'also', ""n't"", 'saddled', 'god-awful', 'dialog', 'plus', 'also', 'character', 'far', 'more', 'effectively', 'Hoffman.UGH', ""'m"", 'torn', 'obviously', 'leaning', 'more', 'side', 'film', 'disaster', 'outside', 'concept', 'De', 'Niro', 'film', 'really', 'Leave', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'mess', 'something', 'up']",Flawless VHS

He looked just like him and his mannerisms were right on.  The scenario seems a bit far-fetched even in New York City, but who knows, it could happen.  All of the actors were excellent in their roles and both DeNiro and Hoffman seemed to be getting a kick out of playing their scenes together.  It takes me back to the early 90s when 'Valentine' and I were dear friends and just trying to stay alive in a very rich city.

The punchline is Flawless, one of the low points of the holiday movie season so far. Appropriately for a Thanksgiving release, writer-director Joel Schumacher has served up a big, steamy Butterball with all the trimmings. He should have called this one Shameless.After spending most of the decade alternating between bloated Batman sequels and pallid John Grisham adaptations, Schumacher has wisely decided to retrench with  a smaller scale, character-driven drama. The problem is, he's neglected to supply the characters. Robert De Niro stars as security guard Walter Koontz, a neighborhood hero who suffers a stroke while trying to intervene in a drug deal gone awry. As part of his recovery, Walt's physical therapist suggests he take singing lessons. Reluctantly, the homophobic Walt approaches his neighbor Rusty (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a drag performer who keeps a piano in his apartment. Needing money for his eventual sexual reassignment surgery, Rusty agrees to take on Walt as a client.No doubt De Niro and Hoffman were both attracted to roles that, on the surface, cry out for major award nominations. But neither of these talented actors is given much to work with beyond superficial showiness. As he did in Awakenings, De Niro nails the technical specifics of his impairment, right down to the muffled, sidelong manner of speech generally associated with stroke victims. But Walt is so ill-defined before he is stricken, pretty much all we know about him is that he's gruff. Hoffman's performance dances around the edges of caricature - hands flitting about, voice dripping with honeyed sarcasm - but his raw emotionalism lends Rusty a depth not provided by the screenplay.If Schumacher has ever conjured an authentic moment on screen, I've missed it. Even his best work is convincing only as movie-land fantasy, and Flawless is no exception. Everything that happens is dramatically rigged, worst of all the ongoing drug money subplot, which is about as gritty and believable as an old episode of Police Woman.  It's a sure sign that Schumacher didn't trust his central story to hold an audience's interest.In addition to Walt's singing lessons, there are life lessons to be learned, of course - be yourself, let your freak flag fly, and you'll find the people who accept you for what you are. It doesn't hurt that in Walt's case those people happen to include a cute young tango dancer who inexplicably has the hots for a middle-aged, semi-paralyzed ex-security guard. Eventually even Walt's crusty poker buddies bond with his new drag queen pals, although we aren't shown how or why. It's all meant to be very feel-good and life affirming, but the net effect of all these bogus epiphanies is not unlike that of traditional Thanksgiving overindulgence.

477506,A8540ROXP4VOI,6305781052,David M. Glasgow,"[2, 3]","Flawless is set up as a comparison of Rusty and Walter--both feel trapped in bodies which, for different reasons, do not feel like &quot;home.&quot;  Both are involved in unhealthy relationships, and are forced to deal with  that cold truth each in his way.  From those parallels COULD spring a truly  moving story of self-discovery and broadened awareness of common  humanity.What happens instead seems to be that Flawless sinks into a  celebration of drag--of caricaturing roles both expected and unexpected,  without concern for the subtle humanity of the persons behind the masks.  Are all New York Police officers sensitivity-challenged jocks?  Are all  hispanic New Yorkers drug addicts and gangsters?  Are all women helpless  pawns to the whims of the men around them?  Are all gay men either bitchy  drag queens or stammering Republicans?  (We won't even begin to examine the  view this film seems to have of transgenderism.)DeNiro and Hoffman,  excellent character actors both, offer performances which, extracted from  the banality of this script, would have been career points.

I love Philip Seymour Hoffman, and I love Robert DeNiro even more; however, my passion for those two actors just couldn't carry me through this film happily.While Hoffman does play a fairly good drag queen, and while DeNiro does a good job portraying a stroke victim, this film is rife with awful stereotypes. Folks who've been in The Family Scene will chuckle at a few good lines and inside jokes, but there will also be substantial groaning at tired old cliches and even more tired old reparte. Gay culture is no longer the hush-hush sub-sub-culture it once was - the straights are onto the lingo for the most part, and stuff that was once Known Only By Gay Folks is common knowledge. Trouble is, this movie seems to think it's all still very mysterious.Additionally, there are no gay men in this film who are not queens or Gay Republicans in Suits, and the only lesbians (seen for all of perhaps 15 seconds) are large butches. Granted, the film isn't about lesbians, but still - how about giving fair time to non-polarized gay and lesbian folks? What about the outdoorsy, down-to-earth gay guys, or the lesbians that don't have the once-requisite haircut? Let's be real, here, people. A lot of gay folks are Just Folks, too.The stereotypes don't end at the gay & lesbian folks, though - nope, we also have Skanky Prostitues; Sleazy, Corrupt Desk Clerk of Seedy Apartment Building; Filthy, Brutal Drug Dealer and His Thugs; Hooker with the Heart of Gold; and sundry other people we have all seen before (and have seen done better, too.) Even the several storylines have been done before - take your pick.Despite all of its faults, however, ""Flawless"" is a fairly enjoyable film (note the three stars, instead of one or two,) largely because Hoffman and DeNiro try to rise above the cliches swarming around them like mosquitos and just play the parts as they felt they should be played. If only the script writers had given them better material, this really could have been entertaining. I'm very fond of Jason Isaacs, who is nearly as sexy in drag as he is out of it.

477511,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6305781052,"""flickjunkie""","[49, 51]","`Flawless' is an offbeat story about Walter Koontz (Robert De Niro) an ex-cop who suffers a stroke and loses partial ability to speak.  In an effort to regain some of his speech capabilities it is recommended to him  that he take singing lessons.  So he decides to ask his neighbor Rusty  (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who is a female impersonator, to give him singing  lessons.  This is an unlikely pairing because Walter is a belligerent  homophobe.This film was written and directed by Joel Schumacher.  His  story, though peculiar, makes some powerful points.  This is a story about  hatred, bigotry and reconciliation.  Walter learns through his disability  who his friends really are, and who they are not.  It seems that the people  he hates treat him a lot better than the people he thought he loved.  Ultimately, he is able to look past his prejudices to find the human  elements that make him and Rusty not so different after all.This was an  excellent character study of both main characters, giving a lot of insight  into the motivations and lives of each.  Unfortunately, the story meanders  too often to irrelevant characters and scenes that don't really contribute  much (like the Gay Republicans).  Schumacher would have been better to  concentrate on the relationship between Walter and Rusty rather than  digressing so frequently into Rusty's relationships with his friends.De  Niro was outstanding in this film.  Not only was he excellent in the  emotional portrayal of a man having to deal with a sudden debilitating  stroke, but he was very realistic in his portrayal of the physical  disability itself.  The combination of his struggles to do the simplest of  tasks and the obvious look of anguish and frustration on his face was  poignant and affecting.Hoffman brought a lot of emotional energy to his  part, and his imitation of a drag queen was passable, though somewhat  forced and unnatural.  Wilson Jermaine Heredia, who played Cha-Cha, the  winner of the Flawless contest, was a much more convincing queen.I rated  this film a 7/10.  This is a good film that helps us understand that the  remedy for the fear wrought of our differences is understanding, not  hatred.  In that respect it makes an important contribution.  If cross  dressing and blatantly gay themes put you off, perhaps you should defy your  inclinations and see it.",4,Offbeat movie with a point,958348800,"05 15, 2000",2000,2357,"['Flawless', 'offbeat', 'story', 'Walter', 'Koontz', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'ex-cop', 'who', 'stroke', 'partial', 'ability', 'speak', 'effort', 'regain', 'speech', 'capabilities', 'recommended', 'take', 'singing', 'lessons', 'ask', 'neighbor', 'Rusty', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'female', 'impersonator', 'give', 'singing', 'lessons', 'unlikely', 'pairing', 'Walter', 'belligerent', 'homophobe.This', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'story', 'peculiar', 'powerful', 'points', 'story', 'hatred', 'bigotry', 'reconciliation', 'Walter', 'disability', 'who', 'friends', 'really', 'are', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'people', 'treat', 'lot', 'better', 'people', 'thought', 'loved', 'Ultimately', 'able', 'look', 'prejudices', 'find', 'human', 'elements', 'make', 'Rusty', 'not', 'so', 'different', 'all.This', 'was', 'excellent', 'character', 'study', 'main', 'characters', 'giving', 'lot', 'insight', 'motivations', 'lives', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'meanders', 'too', 'often', 'irrelevant', 'characters', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'contribute', 'much', 'Gay', 'Republicans', 'Schumacher', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'concentrate', 'relationship', 'Walter', 'Rusty', 'rather', 'digressing', 'so', 'frequently', 'Rusty', 'relationships', 'friends.De', 'Niro', 'was', 'outstanding', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'excellent', 'emotional', 'portrayal', 'man', 'having', 'deal', 'sudden', 'debilitating', 'stroke', 'was', 'very', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'physical', 'disability', 'combination', 'struggles', 'do', 'simplest', 'tasks', 'obvious', 'look', 'anguish', 'frustration', 'face', 'was', 'poignant', 'affecting.Hoffman', 'brought', 'lot', 'emotional', 'energy', 'part', 'imitation', 'drag', 'queen', 'was', 'passable', 'somewhat', 'forced', 'unnatural', 'Wilson', 'Jermaine', 'Heredia', 'who', 'played', 'Cha-Cha', 'winner', 'Flawless', 'contest', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'convincing', 'queen.I', 'rated', 'film', '7/10', 'good', 'film', 'understand', 'remedy', 'fear', 'wrought', 'differences', 'understanding', 'not', 'hatred', 'respect', 'important', 'contribution', 'cross', 'dressing', 'blatantly', 'gay', 'themes', 'put', 'off', 'perhaps', 'should', 'defy', 'inclinations', 'see']",Flawless VHS

Then again, he got the good lines, and because De Niro, playing a cop  who has had a stroke, can barely speak, he works double time for both of  them. Unfortunately, other than that, and the gracious way Robert De Niro  lets himself be upstaged consistently by Hoffman, there is little here of  interest and not much reality.  Were they going for &quot;La Cage aux  Folles&quot;?  See that instead--the origional.Seeing two people work  out their oppositional attitudes is always interesting, but this movie is  top heavy and out of balance-- and the deck is stacked against De Niro. His  performances should always be perfect--isn't that what we expect?  He  doesn't seem to be &quot;into&quot; this as an actor. It's puzzling.  Perhaps he was trying something &quot;new&quot; again. What the heck is  going on with him?It's sort of cute, in parts, but not terribly real,  I am afraid.  Fun if you want to see a lot of drag queens yelling at gay  republicans... that was my favorite scene.  Dressed outrageously in full  drag, the &quot;ladies&quot; really gave it to these poor suited up guys  who are half out, half in the closet, concerning the annual Gay Pride  Parade in New York City.

I had never heard of this 1999 movie but it was starring Robert DeNiro and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who I just seen play a wonderful character role as the writer in State and Main, and so I decided to watch it.The theme is interesting.  Robert DeNiro plays an aging former security guard who lives in a run-down apartment house peopled by some weird and interesting characters.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is cast as the drag queen across the courtyard who taunts the homophobic DeNiro who amuses himself by paying for women he meets at a sleazy dance hall.Then DeNiro has a stroke.  When he is released from the hospital his helplessness makes him contemplate suicide.  His physical therapist recommends singing lessons to help his slurred speech.  &quot;At least you'll be able to have phone sex&quot; says the therapist.  As Philip Seymour Hoffman is a singing teacher, these two fine actors are thrown together for some excellent scenes.  Usually drag queen characters play comic roles but his is a very serious part, as is DeNiro's.  I understand also that DeNiro visited rehabilitation centers and worked with a physical therapist in order to get the speech and physical problems of a stroke victim correct.  This authenticity comes through in his outstanding acting.  There's much to say in this film about courage and compassion. The chemistry between the two actors make it all very real.It's too bad that the rest of the film is of the Grade B variety.  There's some silly plot about a drug deal and hidden cash and some bad guy gangster scenes that are overacted and feel like the amateur hour.  There's too many stereotype characters who live in the apartment house.  There are too many subplots. The problem with this film is that it can't decide if its a comedy or a drama.  It's strongest in its dramatic moments but then seems to fade off and become just too busy and distracting.  DeNiro's and Hoffman's performances are so good, however, that it's worth watching just for that. There's much food for thought here and good issues raised about physically challenged people.So for those of you who don't' necessarily demand  perfection in every video you see, I give this film a modest recommendation.

One of the biggest would be the whole drug dealer plot. So why do I give this movie 5 stars? For many reasons.1) I enjoy the performances; DeNiro and Hoffman are superb in their roles and work well off each other. I even like the supporting roles, even if they are over the top at times.2) I like the main story and theme; how two very different people can connect. Walter and Rusty share one thing in common, lonliness, a desire for companionship (in love and in friendship).3) I think it's well made, production wise. The music works well and the look of the cinematography gives it a grimey yet hopeful feel.

477537,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305781052,Reviewer,"[7, 8]","A retired, conservative New York City policeman and a drag queen manage to  overcome some significant barriers between them, to form an alliance for  their mutual benefit in ""Flawless,"" written and directed by Joel  Schumacher.  In his apartment building, Walter Koontz (Robert De Niro)  suffers a stroke while coming to the aid of some neighbors who are trying  to elude a gunman; two people are killed in what turns out to be a matter  concerning some money stolen from a local drug dealer.  Walter ends up with  his right side paralyzed, barely able to walk, and his speech impaired;  which is one of the major obstacles he must learn to overcome.  He is  encouraged to try singing lessons in an effort to learn how to speak again.  To that end, he enlists the help of a neighbor, with whom he had  heretofore been at odds, a drag queen named Rusty Zimmerman (Philip Seymour  Hoffman).  ""Busty Rusty,"" as he is billed at the club where he works, is  saving for a sex-change operation, and can use the extra money, so he  accepts the job.  This leads to an unlikely bond between Walter, a man who  values his independence, and Rusty, a tortured soul who wouldn't wish his  life upon anyone.  Rusty can identify with the sense of isolation Walter is  feeling from being unable to do for himself any longer; he understands his  self-pity, and helps him try to get past it:  ""I've been to that pity-party  myself,"" Rusty tells him.  Meanwhile, the tension throughout the building  remains high; the drug dealer is convinced that his money is being kept by  one of the residents, and the constant presence of his hired goons becomes  a menace to everyone who lives there.  Ultimately Walter and Rusty become  involved in it, which leads to a climax that pointedly illustrates the  magnanimity of the human spirit.  De Niro, as expected, turns in a  sterling performance here; he is so physically convincing, shading Walter's  disability with such finesse, that you forget that this is an actor playing  a role.  There is no De Niro on the screen; this is, in fact, a man named  Walter Koontz.  Hoffman, as well, turns in a brilliant performance, imbuing  Rusty with every nuance; he aptly conveys his subtle anxieties and the  rancor that surrounds him, and with which he must live, every day of his  life.  Skipp Sudduth does a good job, also, as Walter's friend, Tommy, who  must work through his own confusion in dealing with Walter's situation, and  the people with which he now finds him involved; before the stroke, drag  queens were definitely not a part of their immediate circle of friends.  The supporting cast includes Barry Miller (Leonard), Christopher Bauer  (Jacko), Daphne Rubin-Vega (Tia) and Karina Arrovave (Amber).  Schumacher  has deftly crafted a character study that examines diversity and proffers  the rewards of a symbiotic existence.  The message is that no one is  flawless; we're imperfect creatures living together in an imperfect world,  and if we can only get beyond ourselves and our prejudices, we just may  find that gold at the end of the rainbow.  ""Flawless"" is not without it's  own flaws, either; some of the scenes involving the other drag queens and  some of the criminal elements are somewhat overplayed at times, but that's  a minor complaint.  This film is deeply felt without being sentimental, and  sheds some light on the human condition.

477539,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,6305781052,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 8]","A small film filled with laudatory intentions and high-powered star performances, &quot;Flawless,&quot; is, regrettably, better in its individual parts than as a whole. This most opposite of opposites-attract  love stories features a homophobic stroke victim and a less-than-gorgeous  drag queen who forge an unlikely friendship as neighbors in a rundown  apartment located in a crime-infested section of New York City.In the  early part of the film, writer/director Joel Schumacher fills in the  backgrounds of this retired cop and this struggling chantreusse, drawing  parallels between their seemingly alien worlds, intercutting, for instance,  between the subdued ambience of a straight dance club and the raucous  atmosphere of a no-holds-barred transvestite stage performance. As the two  neighbors brush up against each other in occasional random encounters in  hallways and elevators, we see the seething hatred that comes from the fear  of the unknown and the inexplicable that routinely divides human beings one  from another. Then Walter Koontz is felled by a stroke which leaves him  paralyzed on one side and virtually without the ability to speak. On a  doctor's advice, Walter swallows his pride and asks Rusty to give him  singing lessons to help him regain his speech.Thus, the stage is set for  a couple of characters who intitially feel they are worlds-apart in their  lives, interests and values, to discover the common humanity that lies  beneath the surface and actually ties them together. The stroke, as the  great leveler, makes Walter, in particular, cognizant of the struggles  Rusty has had to undergo as a result of his very noticeable  &quot;difference.&quot;If &quot;Flawless&quot; had stuck to this  two-character format it might have been a more powerful film. Two elements  weigh it down, however. One is the overly familiar and predictable arc the  film travels; we simply know well in advance where this story is taking us.  More serious are the constant diversions in the form of superfluous  subsidiary characters and obscure subplots that keep pulling us away from  the movie's center of gravity - which are the dynamite performances of  Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robert DeNiro who invest both their tricky roles  - one dealing with a physical handicap, the other the flamboyance normally  associated with the drag queen stereotype - with a subtlety and humanity  that could easily have been lost in a welter of method-actor hamminess and  hyperbole. Instead, both actors - especially Hoffman - rivet our attention  in a way that few of the other elements in the film do. Particularly  annoying are a routine drug-dealing subplot and an &quot;action movie&quot;  denouement of astounding inappropriateness and stupidity. In a way too, the  film is rather schizophrenic in its portrayal of gay people. On the one  hand, the drag queens are all made to seem fun and likeable, but, on the  other, they also all fit the cliche of homosexuals often presented to the  outside world. In fact, the film expends no effort in according similar  sympathy to &quot;straight acting&quot; gays, particularly in a scene in  which the queens are confronted by a group of gay Republicans in suits who  want the &quot;ladies&quot; to tone down their flamboyance for the upcoming  gay pride parade. Thus, in attempting to make an important observation  about elements of homophobia lurking in the gay community itself,  Schumacher, ironically, becomes guilt of the same crime  himself.&quot;Flawless&quot; is worth seeing for the performances of the  two lead actors, for its admirable call for tolerance and understanding and  for its occasionally incisive encounters between these two very appealing  misfits. However, for a far less contrived, far more convincing examination  of this subject, check out the Cuban film from a few years back, the  delicious &quot;Strawberry and Chocolate.&quot; That film achieves the type  of thematic unity and gripping emotional power &quot;Flawless,&quot;  despite all its good intentions, never really manages.",2,well meaning but awkward drama,964483200,"07 25, 2000",2000,4072,"['small', 'film', 'filled', 'laudatory', 'intentions', 'high-powered', 'star', 'performances', 'quot', 'Flawless', 'quot', 'regrettably', 'better', 'individual', 'parts', 'whole', 'most', 'opposite', 'opposites-attract', 'love', 'stories', 'homophobic', 'stroke', 'victim', 'less-than-gorgeous', 'drag', 'queen', 'who', 'forge', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'neighbors', 'rundown', 'apartment', 'located', 'crime-infested', 'section', 'New', 'York', 'City.In', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'writer/director', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'backgrounds', 'retired', 'cop', 'struggling', 'chantreusse', 'drawing', 'parallels', 'seemingly', 'alien', 'worlds', 'intercutting', 'instance', 'subdued', 'ambience', 'straight', 'dance', 'club', 'raucous', 'atmosphere', 'no-holds-barred', 'transvestite', 'stage', 'performance', 'two', 'neighbors', 'brush', 'up', 'other', 'occasional', 'random', 'encounters', 'hallways', 'elevators', 'see', 'seething', 'hatred', 'fear', 'unknown', 'inexplicable', 'routinely', 'human', 'beings', 'one', 'Then', 'Walter', 'Koontz', 'felled', 'stroke', 'paralyzed', 'one', 'side', 'virtually', 'ability', 'speak', 'doctor', 'advice', 'Walter', 'pride', 'Rusty', 'give', 'singing', 'lessons', 'help', 'regain', 'speech.Thus', 'stage', 'set', 'couple', 'characters', 'who', 'intitially', 'feel', 'are', 'worlds-apart', 'lives', 'interests', 'values', 'discover', 'common', 'humanity', 'surface', 'actually', 'ties', 'together', 'stroke', 'great', 'leveler', 'Walter', 'particular', 'cognizant', 'struggles', 'Rusty', 'had', 'undergo', 'result', 'very', 'noticeable', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'Flawless', 'quot', 'had', 'stuck', 'two-character', 'format', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'powerful', 'film', 'Two', 'elements', 'weigh', 'down', 'however', 'One', 'overly', 'familiar', 'predictable', 'arc', 'film', 'travels', 'simply', 'know', 'well', 'advance', 'where', 'story', 'taking', 'More', 'serious', 'are', 'constant', 'diversions', 'form', 'superfluous', 'subsidiary', 'characters', 'obscure', 'subplots', 'keep', 'pulling', 'away', 'movie', 'center', 'gravity', 'are', 'dynamite', 'performances', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'who', 'invest', 'tricky', 'one', 'dealing', 'physical', 'handicap', 'other', 'flamboyance', 'normally', 'associated', 'drag', 'queen', 'stereotype', 'subtlety', 'humanity', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'welter', 'method-actor', 'hamminess', 'hyperbole', 'Instead', 'actors', 'especially', 'Hoffman', 'rivet', 'attention', 'way', 'few', 'other', 'elements', 'film', 'do', 'Particularly', 'annoying', 'are', 'routine', 'drug-dealing', 'subplot', 'quot', 'action', 'movie', 'quot', 'denouement', 'astounding', 'inappropriateness', 'stupidity', 'way', 'too', 'film', 'rather', 'schizophrenic', 'portrayal', 'gay', 'people', 'one', 'hand', 'drag', 'queens', 'are', 'made', 'seem', 'fun', 'likeable', 'other', 'also', 'fit', 'cliche', 'homosexuals', 'often', 'presented', 'outside', 'world', 'fact', 'film', 'effort', 'according', 'similar', 'sympathy', 'quot', 'acting', 'quot', 'gays', 'particularly', 'scene', 'queens', 'are', 'confronted', 'group', 'gay', 'Republicans', 'suits', 'who', 'want', 'quot', 'ladies', 'quot', 'tone', 'down', 'flamboyance', 'upcoming', 'gay', 'pride', 'parade', 'Thus', 'attempting', 'make', 'important', 'observation', 'elements', 'homophobia', 'lurking', 'gay', 'community', 'Schumacher', 'ironically', 'guilt', 'same', 'crime', 'himself.', 'quot', 'Flawless', 'quot', 'seeing', 'performances', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'admirable', 'call', 'tolerance', 'understanding', 'occasionally', 'incisive', 'encounters', 'two', 'very', 'appealing', 'misfits', 'However', 'far', 'less', 'contrived', 'far', 'more', 'convincing', 'examination', 'subject', 'check', 'out', 'Cuban', 'film', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'delicious', 'quot', 'Strawberry', 'Chocolate.', 'quot', 'film', 'type', 'thematic', 'unity', 'gripping', 'emotional', 'power', 'quot', 'Flawless', 'quot', 'good', 'intentions', 'never', 'really']",Flawless VHS

Now the question is why would de Niro would do a movie that resembles more or less a ""whatever happened the young taxi driver?"". It seems to me the movie Flawless is telling us that he ended up a cop and won many medals, and he still braving the odds and attacking bad people. except that he has a change of mind about the ""scum of society"". He seems to be more accepting of homosexuals in Flawless and this is a character development that the director of the film wanted us to see compared to Taxi Driver.

477544,A3ELSU1SHRX09Y,6305781052,skunktrain,"[5, 6]","To me, the premise of this movie was simple: Pair up two ""misfits"" who need acceptance, and find this acceptance in each other. And it does work, for the most part.Robert De Niro is a grumpy, homophobic retired cop who is humbled and mortified after a stroke makes him semi-parilyzed, and slurs his speech. He tries to shut himself off from the world, and from his ""old life"" as a cop with a heroic past. The other half of this odd teacm is Philip Seymour Hoffman (who gives an AMAZING performance). He plays an overweight drag queen who obviously has a lot of emotional scar tissue from a life full of rejection and heartbreak. He's a wonderful character--full of funny one-liners and a self-depreciating wit. But underneath his sarcastic humor is a lot of raw pain.The two start out as antagonistic neighbors, until De Niro is ""desperate"" enough to ask for singing lessons from Hoffman. The singing lessons will help him improve his slurred speech, and Hoffman is an accessable voice teacher--it's just too inconvenient for De Niro to travel any farther in the slippery snow.So, these two start a tenuous friendship. And we see that they have a lot in common--both feel like rejects. De Niro cannot accept his disability, and feels like his ""old"" life is over. Hoffman just wants to be accepted, and finds that getting some understanding an acceptance from a person like De Niro is an interesting concept. Both need to be understood as they are *now*. And by the end of the film, they both realize that they can have this acceptance.There's also a sub-plot involving an evil gangster looking to recover his stolen money, but the main point of the film (in my opinion) is in these two main characters, and their ""odd couple"" relationship.The story is a little flawed; I felt something was missing at the end. The sub-plot with the gangsters was OK, but not that compelling. It was needed to move the story's conflict and drama along, but it wasn't as important as the two main characters.I really enjoyed this film. The performances were wonderful, and I liked its message--that compassion is something that we all need to give, and to receive. And that we all need to stop being so hard on ourselves, and also on others.",4,"Flawed, (not Flawless) but still a good tale with heart.",1048982400,"03 30, 2003",2003,2222,"['premise', 'movie', 'was', 'simple', 'Pair', 'up', 'two', 'misfits', 'who', 'need', 'acceptance', 'find', 'acceptance', 'other', 'work', 'most', 'part.Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'grumpy', 'homophobic', 'retired', 'cop', 'who', 'humbled', 'mortified', 'stroke', 'semi-parilyzed', 'slurs', 'speech', 'shut', 'off', 'world', 'old', 'life', 'cop', 'heroic', 'past', 'other', 'half', 'odd', 'teacm', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'AMAZING', 'performance', 'overweight', 'drag', 'queen', 'who', 'obviously', 'lot', 'emotional', 'scar', 'tissue', 'life', 'full', 'rejection', 'heartbreak', 'wonderful', 'character', 'full', 'funny', 'one-liners', 'self-depreciating', 'wit', 'sarcastic', 'humor', 'lot', 'raw', 'pain.The', 'two', 'start', 'as', 'antagonistic', 'neighbors', 'De', 'Niro', 'desperate', 'enough', 'ask', 'singing', 'lessons', 'Hoffman', 'singing', 'lessons', 'will', 'help', 'improve', 'slurred', 'speech', 'Hoffman', 'accessable', 'voice', 'teacher', 'just', 'too', 'inconvenient', 'De', 'Niro', 'travel', 'farther', 'slippery', 'snow.So', 'two', 'start', 'tenuous', 'friendship', 'see', 'have', 'lot', 'common', 'feel', 'rejects', 'De', 'Niro', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'disability', 'feels', 'old', 'life', 'Hoffman', 'just', 'be', 'accepted', 'getting', 'understanding', 'acceptance', 'person', 'De', 'Niro', 'interesting', 'concept', 'need', 'be', 'understood', 'are', '*now*', 'end', 'film', 'realize', 'can', 'have', 'acceptance.There', 'also', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'evil', 'gangster', 'looking', 'recover', 'stolen', 'money', 'main', 'point', 'film', 'opinion', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'odd', 'couple', 'relationship.The', 'story', 'little', 'flawed', 'felt', 'something', 'was', 'missing', 'end', 'sub-plot', 'gangsters', 'was', 'OK', 'not', 'compelling', 'was', 'needed', 'move', 'story', 'conflict', 'drama', 'along', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'important', 'two', 'main', 'characters.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'performances', 'were', 'wonderful', 'liked', 'message', 'compassion', 'something', 'need', 'give', 'receive', 'need', 'stop', 'being', 'so', 'hard', 'ourselves', 'also', 'others']",Flawless VHS

Joel Schumacher, director of *St. Elmo's Fire* and *Batman and Robin*,  among others, does a really excellent job here.  Nothing needs to be said  about the skills of veteran actor Robert DeNiro.  Philip Seymour Hoffman, a  young actor who has rightfully come into his own in the past decade, gives  one of his best and most insightful performances.DeNiro is Walter, a  decorated hero of the NYPD, who suffers a stroke that affects him  emotionally as well as physically.  His doctor suggests singing lessons to  help him improve his speech.  Rather than be seen in public any more than  necessary, Walter asks Rusty (Hoffman), another tenant in his apartment  building who coordinates a drag queen stage show, to give him the lessons.  The fun begins immediately, as these two have had a mutual dislike for each  other from their earliest encounters.Critics have said, among other  things, that:  (1) the dialogue between Rusty and Walter is cliche-ridden  and (2) the film seems to say that all gay men in NYC are either drag  queens or &quot;log cabin Republicans.&quot;  Rubbish!  Walter's comments  to Rusty at the beginning of their relationship are the usual things you  would expect to hear from a homophobic male.  Rusty's comebacks are as  often as not laugh-out-loud funny, as well as very wise, and they  definitely show his strength of character.As for the alleged limited  depiction of the NYC male homosexual population, it is really a matter of  &quot;birds of a feather flock together.&quot;  The movie doesn't pretend  to give an overall view of the gay/lesbian population in NY or anywhere  else.  Rusty and his friends spend a lot of time rehearsing their nightly  stage show, giving the show, and gathering with their friends at favorite  drag queen hang-outs--probably perfectly typical behavior for this  specialized population group.  And it is clear in the one confrontation  between Rusty's gang and the &quot;button down&quot; gay Republicans that  the latter group finds the drag queens' appearance and mannerisms  unacceptable.  Who's to say that others in the city's gay community  didn't/don't feel the same way?It is said that upon his first reading of  the script, Hoffman recognized that Rusty wasn't really gay, but a  transexual--a woman trapped in a man's body--a tough concept for either gay  or straight people to grasp.  Though &quot;straight&quot; himself, Hoffman  benefitted from the character coaching of the real drag queen celebrities  who took the roles of Rusty's best friends and his partners in producing  the night club act.  The result is an unforgettable performance in which  Rusty proves to be the best person of all to help Walter learn to cope with  a body he has come to despise.  Rusty, who is making plans to have sex  change surgery, knows more than almost anyone else could what it is to be  trapped in a body that doesn't fit the person inside it.The film is  alternately deeply moving and uproariously funny as Walter and Rusty come  to really understand and bond with one another.  There are not many movies  that have tackled the idea of a gay man and a straight man becoming true  friends.  This film handles one possible scenario for that topic in a way  that is stylish, uplifting, and unforgettable.If the story's premise is  the tiniest bit contrived, so what?  That has been so of a lot of excellent  books and movies, and it hasn't hurt the story one bit.  It is inherent to  fiction that it be a bit contrived.

DeNiro plays a New York City cop who suffers a stroke. He then receives singing lessons from his upstairs drag queen neighbor to help him with his speech. The bulk of the story deals with thugs looking for money that someone in the cop's and drag queen's building stole.""Flawless"" is a cute comedy/drama and what makes the film so memorable are the amazing performances by its leads. However, Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals the picture from DeNiro with his intense and convincing portrayal of a drag queen. Everything from Hoffman's facial expressions to his voice to his mannerisms makes the viewer think they are really watching a real-life drag performer on the screen. Hoffman's portrayal is one of the best I have ever witnessed.The movie has been pretty much forgotten by its gay audience that it was targeted for. This is obvious as the film is now out-of-print and Amazon has none in stock. I suggest in purchasing a copy of ""Flawless"" from a buyer through Amazon; they have cheap copies and the movie is really cute and enjoyable.The DVD comes with a collectible booklet and the original theatrical trailer.

I felt that most stereotypes got used a great deal and that the story was a bit strange. De Niro did an excellant job of being an old dog that hates new tricks and hates Gays. His role was believable and his vocal trainer ( Drag Queen ) was totally over the top but since I have known a few that are just as over the top as him, I was able to suspend my disbelief and enjoy the film. The film quality was good and it had some good comic moments. I realize that the message was meant to be deep however I felt the movie was lacking soul. I never got drawn in to the point I forgot it was a movie, not even for a few minutes. It's an enjoyable movie for an evening sitting in front of the tube but not one you would strongly suggest friends rent or see particularly.

This film may possibly qualify as one of the pantheon of &quot;so bad it's actually funny&quot; movies, but I'm not entirely certain about that. Give it another five years on video to really let the bad performances, bad writing, bad direction, and bad concepts start to ferment. This film was clearly written by a Screaming (untalented) queen, if not directed by one. How DeNiro got roped into this is a mystery only some Far Eastern Oracle could ever hope to answer. I think he did it because he lost a poker bet with somebody. As it is, he should be hung with a feather boa for this celluloid transgression. I dare not guess at Phillip Seymour-T's reason. This was not drama, because it was too improbable and campy. This was not satire, because how do you satirize drag queens? They are already larger than life.  This was definitely comedy, at the very end. But I don't think the film started out that way, and that's a very scary thought, indeed. Rent or buy this only if you, yourself, are a drag queen(in which case you'll love it) or if you hate Robert DeNiro and really wish to see him in the throes of a totally embarrassing career move (in which case you'll REALLY love it).",2,"Silly, Campy, and Bad BAD BAD",957139200,"05 1, 2000",2000,1340,"['One', 'thing', 'certain', 'one', 'day', 'distant', 'future', 'whenthis', 'film', 'revived', 'obscure', 'gay', 'theater', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'WILLroll', 'grave', 'film', 'may', 'possibly', 'qualify', 'one', 'pantheon', 'quot', 'so', 'bad', 'actually', 'funny', 'quot', 'movies', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'certain', 'Give', 'five', 'years', 'video', 'really', 'let', 'bad', 'performances', 'bad', 'writing', 'bad', 'direction', 'bad', 'concepts', 'start', 'ferment', 'film', 'was', 'clearly', 'written', 'Screaming', 'untalented', 'queen', 'not', 'directed', 'one', 'How', 'DeNiro', 'got', 'roped', 'mystery', 'only', 'Far', 'Eastern', 'Oracle', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'answer', 'think', 'did', 'lost', 'poker', 'bet', 'somebody', 'should', 'be', 'hung', 'feather', 'boa', 'celluloid', 'transgression', 'dare', 'not', 'guess', 'Phillip', 'Seymour-T', 'reason', 'was', 'not', 'drama', 'was', 'too', 'improbable', 'campy', 'was', 'not', 'satire', 'how', 'do', 'satirize', 'drag', 'queens', 'are', 'already', 'larger', 'life', 'was', 'definitely', 'comedy', 'very', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'started', 'out', 'way', 'very', 'scary', 'thought', 'indeed', 'Rent', 'buy', 'only', 'are', 'drag', 'queen', 'case', ""'ll"", 'love', 'hate', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'really', 'wish', 'see', 'throes', 'totally', 'embarrassing', 'career', 'move', 'case', ""'ll"", 'REALLY', 'love']",Flawless VHS
