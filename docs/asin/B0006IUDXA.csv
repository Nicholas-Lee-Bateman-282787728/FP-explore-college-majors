869674,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0006IUDXA,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[6, 7]","A unique and different kind of TV action series, MacGyver made its television premiere in the Fall of 1985 to much fanfare. Audiences immediately responded to the title character and his unusual penchant for turning everyday items like chewing gum and paperclips into elaborate life-saving contraptions. In this way, it maintained a slight resemblance to The A-Team, and this recurring plot device helped MacGyver build a strong cult following...Richard Dean Anderson plays the title role of MacGyver, an energetic employee of the fictional Phoenix Foundation for Research. An unorthodox hero by action series standards, MacGyver has a deadly fear of heights. A pacifist who refuses to use weapons, he relies heavily on his ability to use his brain and tinker with the various materials at his disposal. MacGyver's best friend, and the director of the Phoenix Foundation, is Pete Thornton (Dana Elcar). Pete often sends MacGyver on Foundation missions and sometimes comes to his aid (usually after MacGyver has saved the day). In addition, MacGyver is joined on a regular basis by his airplane pilot friend Jack Dalton (Bruce McGill), a man who constantly entangles himself in illegal activities and other troublesome situations. Between the usual slew of bad guys, the vendetta of archenemy Murdoc (Michael Des Barres), and his multitude of troublesome friends, MacGyver is always in the midst of interesting and dangerous events, and the show's true entertainment value derives from watching MacGyver's distinctive method of dealing with each one...The MacGyver (Season 1) DVD features a number of action-packed episodes including the series pilot in which MacGyver is forced to race against the clock when a team of scientists are trapped underground after a lab experiment goes awry. Wanting to contain the leak, the Army allots a small time window for MacGyver to pull off his mission before they destroy the facility... Fans will make note of some interesting aspects of the pilot episode such as Dana Elcar's role as another character, MacGyver's use of a gun, and MacGyver's boss is a man named Gantner (Michael Lerner)... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Trumbo's World"" in which MacGyver, while on expedition in Brazil, encounters and wages war with a mile-wide column of army ants, and ""Every Time She Smiles"" in which MacGyver meets up with a beautiful, yet talkative, artist named Penny Parker (Teri Hatcher) and the two must escape the clutches of the KGB...Below is a list of episodes included on the MacGyver (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (Pilot)Episode 2 (The Golden Triangle)Episode 3 (Thief of Budapest)Episode 4 (The Gauntlet)Episode 5 (The Heist)Episode 6 (Trumbo's World)Episode 7 (Last Stand)Episode 8 (Hellfire)Episode 9 (The Prodigal)Episode 10 (Target MacGyver)Episode 11 (Nightmares)Episode 12 (Deathlock)Episode 13 (Flame's End)Episode 14 (Countdown)Episode 15 (The Enemy Within)Episode 16 (Every Time She Smiles)Episode 17 (To Be a Man)Episode 18 (Ugly Duckling)Episode 19 (Slow Death)Episode 20 (The Escape)Episode 21 (A Prisoner of Conscience)Episode 22 (The Assassin)The DVD Report",5,What will MacGyver think of next?,1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,3121,"['unique', 'different', 'kind', 'TV', 'action', 'series', 'MacGyver', 'made', 'television', 'premiere', 'Fall', '1985', 'much', 'fanfare', 'Audiences', 'immediately', 'responded', 'title', 'character', 'unusual', 'penchant', 'turning', 'everyday', 'items', 'chewing', 'gum', 'paperclips', 'elaborate', 'life-saving', 'contraptions', 'way', 'maintained', 'slight', 'resemblance', 'A-Team', 'recurring', 'plot', 'device', 'helped', 'MacGyver', 'build', 'strong', 'cult', 'following', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'title', 'role', 'MacGyver', 'energetic', 'employee', 'fictional', 'Phoenix', 'Foundation', 'Research', 'unorthodox', 'hero', 'action', 'series', 'standards', 'MacGyver', 'deadly', 'fear', 'heights', 'pacifist', 'who', 'use', 'weapons', 'heavily', 'ability', 'use', 'brain', 'tinker', 'various', 'materials', 'disposal', 'MacGyver', 'best', 'friend', 'director', 'Phoenix', 'Foundation', 'Pete', 'Thornton', 'Dana', 'Elcar', 'Pete', 'often', 'MacGyver', 'Foundation', 'missions', 'sometimes', 'aid', 'usually', 'MacGyver', 'saved', 'day', 'addition', 'MacGyver', 'joined', 'regular', 'basis', 'airplane', 'pilot', 'friend', 'Jack', 'Dalton', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'man', 'who', 'constantly', 'illegal', 'activities', 'other', 'troublesome', 'situations', 'usual', 'slew', 'bad', 'guys', 'vendetta', 'archenemy', 'Murdoc', 'Michael', 'Des', 'Barres', 'multitude', 'troublesome', 'friends', 'MacGyver', 'always', 'midst', 'interesting', 'dangerous', 'events', 'show', 'true', 'entertainment', 'value', 'watching', 'MacGyver', 'distinctive', 'method', 'dealing', 'one', 'MacGyver', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'number', 'action-packed', 'episodes', 'including', 'series', 'pilot', 'MacGyver', 'forced', 'race', 'clock', 'when', 'team', 'scientists', 'are', 'trapped', 'lab', 'experiment', 'awry', 'Wanting', 'contain', 'leak', 'Army', 'allots', 'small', 'time', 'window', 'MacGyver', 'pull', 'off', 'mission', 'destroy', 'facility', 'Fans', 'will', 'make', 'note', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'pilot', 'episode', 'such', 'Dana', 'Elcar', 'role', 'character', 'MacGyver', 'use', 'gun', 'MacGyver', 'boss', 'man', 'named', 'Gantner', 'Michael', 'Lerner', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'include', 'Trumbo', 'World', 'MacGyver', 'expedition', 'Brazil', 'encounters', 'wages', 'war', 'mile-wide', 'column', 'army', 'ants', 'Time', 'Smiles', 'MacGyver', 'up', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'talkative', 'artist', 'named', 'Penny', 'Parker', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'two', 'must', 'escape', 'clutches', 'KGB', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'MacGyver', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'Episode', '1', 'Pilot', 'Episode', '2', 'Golden', 'Triangle', 'Episode', '3', 'Thief', 'Budapest', 'Episode', '4', 'Gauntlet', 'Episode', '5', 'Heist', 'Episode', '6', 'Trumbo', 'World', 'Episode', '7', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Episode', '8', 'Hellfire', 'Episode', '9', 'Prodigal', 'Episode', '10', 'Target', 'MacGyver', 'Episode', '11', 'Nightmares', 'Episode', '12', 'Deathlock', 'Episode', '13', 'Flame', 'End', 'Episode', '14', 'Countdown', 'Episode', '15', 'Enemy', 'Within', 'Episode', '16', 'Every', 'Time', 'Episode', '17', 'Be', 'Man', 'Episode', '18', 'Ugly', 'Duckling', 'Episode', '19', 'Slow', 'Death', 'Episode', '20', 'Escape', 'Episode', '21', 'Prisoner', 'Conscience', 'Episode', '22', 'Assassin', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

You never  see him shoot a gun, he's afraid of heights, and he can work wonders with a rubber band and a paper  clip.  His esoteric scientific knowledge  and ability  to  cobble together  commonly available  items  for unique  problem  solving is  one  reason this  show  is so popular.  Murdoc is  his arch enemy  who can't be  killed.  Jack Dalton  is his self-centered pilot friend.  MacGyver works for the Phoenix Foundation, a  think tank headed up by his friend Pete Thornton.  The Phoenix Foundation routinely gets called in to solve impossible situations around the world.There are 21 episodes plus the pilot episode.  I have read that all 22 episodes will be on the DVD but that the extras have not yet been announced.1.  Pilot:  The famous episode in which MacGyver uses chocolate to stop an acid leak after a lab explosion.2.  The Golden  Triangle:  MacGvyer becomes involved with enslaved farmers in opium fields.3. Thief of Budapest:  A gypsy girl steals a watch containing microfilm.4. The Gauntlet:  MacGvyer tries to rescue a reporter trapped in central America.5.

869691,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B0006IUDXA,D. Mok,"[294, 309]","I grew up with MacGyver, watching him in two different households on two continents (one with subtitles!) as I was growing up.  For about three years, after having watched shows like 24, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel on DVD, I wondered when they would release MacGyver on DVD.  I raced out in my car this past week when this DVD set was released and prepared myself for a MacGyver marathon.As I plowed through the first two discs, however, my enthusiasm began to wane a little.  The first thing that made me wary was the DVD menu.  This is without a doubt the single laziest DVD release I've ever seen -- no chapter selection menu, no commentary tracks, no appreciations, no cast/crew comments (even in written form), no interviews, not even episode histories or a booklet.  See, MacGyver had existed for so long in my world that I had wanted to know exactly how the show began, when, and in what context.  You will get *nothing* of the sort on this DVD.  This DVD set redefines ""no frills"" -- each episode is divided into six chapters that aren't accessible by chapter menus, only by pressing track forward and back keys.  Six chapters per one-hour episode!  Do the math -- each episode is 46 to 48 minutes long, so each chapter is eight minutes.  In TV terms, enough for four to six scenes.The picture and sound quality are pretty bad as well.  On some episodes this is not noticeable, but on others, I notice degraded sound quality, film scratches, and worse still, shots that look like compressed Avid outputs, where even colour correction appeared to have been skipped.  Sure, it's an old show and some degradation may have happened to the original film and tapes, but geez, the Rhino releases of The Transformers, Celestial Pictures' release of even older Shaw Brothers films, and the Criterion Collection's restoration of Fritz Lang's M (a film over 70 years old) all had far more impressive restoration jobs.  This MacGyver DVD set didn't seem to have any restoration at all.  For a show like MacGyver, as close to my heart as a grade-school trophy, this was disheartening to see.  Paramount Home Video seems to have taken the garage-sale approach to this release -- sell it like it is, warts and all, and with the show's loyal fan base, it'll probably get bought no matter what.  I certainly bought it without batting an eye, but I'm not entirely happy with the product.The content is fairly erratic.  The pilot was exactly the MacGyver I'd remembered and loved -- fast-paced, enjoyable, with a lead character who's become a towering pop-culture icon, the ultimate boyscout, the most wholesome of action heroes, who despises guns, is not that great at melee fighting (sore fists after punching -- a MacGyver trademark), and relies on wits rather than brawn.  Richard Dean Anderson is the lovable, boyishly handsome hero we remember, and his work holds up well; not too hammy, charming, quite subtle with both his comedic and dramatic work.  I was also glad to see ubiquitous '80s actress Darlanne Fluegel in the episode, playing a sidekick who isn't just a wallflower, and the credits held two major shocks -- I had never known that it was Randy Edelman who had written the opening theme (one of my favourite TV themes), and the fabled Tak Fujimoto (The Silence of the Lambs) was the cinematographer on this episode!A couple of things in this set of episodes, however, don't hold up well.  One is the general acting.  Especially in the first 10 episodes or so, I was shocked to see some of the worst acting I'd ever seen on TV, especially on the part of many of the villains and a few of the love interests.  Most glaring are Peter Jurasik as Dr. Charles Alden in the episode ""Trumbo's World"" and Christopher Neame as maniac Quayle in ""Deathlock"".  The directing, writing and editing varied wildly as well -- ""The Heist"" was often positively amateurish in execution.  It's no wonder on this episode we find the DGA's long-standing pseudonym ""Alan Smithee"" in the director's credit, a rarity in television which happens when a director refuses credit on a film or show.  Sometimes the acting and dialogue are almost cartoonish.  These elements in combination suggested to me that maybe this show was better for younger audiences than myself, which may account for why it's held the imagination of so many of us years ago.But a large part of the problem was because the first chunk of this first season was an anomaly among TV creations.  For reasons unknown (this is where I wish they'd included some bonus materials to account for this), the pilot aside, the first shows just don't resemble the MacGyver I've known and loved.  The MacGyver I loved has Dana Elcar as the indispensable Pete Thornton, the terrific villain Murdoc (Michael des Barres), and a certain kind of character dynamic that helped ground the central conceit of MacGyver as super-boyscout hero.  Somehow, the first episodes of this season dispensed with what most TV shows call their ""franchise"", which is a core group of developing characters, familiar settings, and throughlines which extend beyond each episode to arc the entire season.  Maybe the creators of the show were going for something different, but on the first third of the season captured on this DVD set, the only constant character is MacGyver.  And I love the guy, but I couldn't watch just him, and having no other recurring character meant that there was little room for MacGyver himself to develop emotional relationships either.  Gradually, however, the show's producers seemed to recognize this problem and Pete Thornton is introduced -- Murdoc wouldn't appear until Season 2, if my research proves correct.  Dana Elcar is a very good actor and his perfect straight-man turn helped Richard Dean Anderson and the show immensely, and the show began to grow wings.I feel bad giving this DVD set this low-ish rating, because MacGyver is one of the holy grails in my TV experience.  There was no show I'd watched for longer, reruns and all, and rewatching something I'd first seen nearly 20 years ago is just mind-blowing.  However, given the poor restoration job, the lazy packaging, the lack of bonus materials, and the story problems outlined above, I just didn't find rewatching these DVDs to be as much of a kick as I'd imagined it would be.  However, there are still gems I remember from my MacGyver journey (Murdoc please!  And who remembers a young Jason Priestley, playing as a youngster who tries to get a gun as protection?) that have yet to appear, so I'm hoping Paramount will still continue releasing MacGyver episodes from the vault.  Even more so, I hope they will do a more comprehensive, in-depth job on the next batch of DVDs.  This is a seminal show, a personal favourite of mine, and it deserves a royal DVD treatment, which it isn't getting right now.",3,A seminal favourite of a TV show given shaky DVD

MacGyver could always save the day, even if he only had a bobby pin, MacGyver was just larger than life and-rad. MacGyver ran on ABC for seven seasons.The MacGyver Season 1 DVD is well worth the wait.  The six disc DVD set is packaged very nicely.  Each disc comes in it's own individual plastic keepsake case.  The individual cases are enclosed in a hard cardboard box.  The art work on the box is nice.  An added treat, each individual plastic keepsake case has it's own unique art work which includes video stills.The episodes appear on the discs in the order of air date beginning with the pilot episode. The 22 episodes from the 1985-1986 season are in full screen format with Dolby Digital sound.  There are no extras on the discs to my knowledge besides previews for other Paramount releases.  Disc one included previews for Happy Days season 1,Laverne and Shirley season 1 and a few other shows.If you are a MacGyver fan you will be pleased with this dvd set.",5,Very nice packaging and worth the wait!,1106611200,"01 25, 2005",2005,1352,"['MacGyver', 'starring', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'pre-Stargate', 'was', 'very', 'popular', 'one', 'hour', 'drama', '80', 'series', 'ran', 'ABC', 'pretty', 'extended', 'run', 'spawned', 'cult', 'following', 'one', 'expected.Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'starred', 'Angus', 'MacGyver', 'people', 'just', 'called', 'MacGyver', 'MacGyver', 'secret', 'agent', 'knack', 'solving', 'problems', 'most', 'unique', 'charm', 'MacGyver', 'could', 'always', 'save', 'day', 'even', 'only', 'had', 'bobby', 'pin', 'MacGyver', 'was', 'just', 'larger', 'life', 'and-rad', 'MacGyver', 'ran', 'ABC', 'seven', 'seasons.The', 'MacGyver', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'well', 'wait', 'six', 'disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'packaged', 'very', 'nicely', 'disc', 'own', 'individual', 'plastic', 'keepsake', 'case', 'individual', 'cases', 'are', 'enclosed', 'hard', 'cardboard', 'box', 'art', 'work', 'box', 'nice', 'added', 'treat', 'individual', 'plastic', 'keepsake', 'case', 'own', 'unique', 'art', 'work', 'video', 'stills.The', 'episodes', 'appear', 'discs', 'order', 'air', 'date', 'beginning', 'pilot', 'episode', '22', 'episodes', '1985-1986', 'season', 'are', 'full', 'screen', 'format', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'sound', 'are', 'extras', 'discs', 'knowledge', 'previews', 'other', 'Paramount', 'releases', 'Disc', 'one', 'included', 'previews', 'Happy', 'Days', 'season', '1', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'season', '1', 'few', 'other', 'shows.If', 'are', 'MacGyver', 'fan', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'dvd', 'set']",N/A

The episodes share the adventures of a man, rather knowledgeable and capable of confronting any situation, any danger, any adversary without fear because he seems to intuitively know what to do to escape or survive challenges.From preventing major catastrophic events with the help of a simple paper clip, a roll of dock-tape, and a pocket knife, the hero allows us to safely travel with him to all corners of the world. He is James Bond without the help of high tech gadgets!What we like most is the simple things that MacGyver turns into wonderful tools or weapons, and the explanations that permit us to learn and enjoy his fascinating expertise.The first season has 22 episodes and each one is excellent. MacGyver works for the Phoenix Foundation, he is a spy, and always does good wherever he goes, getting involved with others and attempting to do what is right.A treasure to own, especially if you have teenagers around in need of an education on survival skills.

Since Season 1 isn't my favorite (the show hadn't found its stride, nor had the Phoenix Foundation come into existence), I wasn't expecting more than being able to fill in some back story.For that, this set is terrific.  The episodes are full length, not the shortened for extra commercials episodes that you get on TV.  Anderson is good and conveys a real sense of delight and wonder without seeming either naive or stupid.I like the character, and I like the way he thinks his way out of problems.  It's nice to see a good guy with a complex and personal morality.  Too often, we end up believing that a character is the good guy because we're told he is.  With MacGyver, seeing him in action is believing.My problem is that these are three steps below bare basic.  There are no close captions or scene selection options which I thought were standard these days.  Worse, the first disc throws the viewer into commercials for Happy Days and its spinoffs.  The only thing those shows had in common with MacGyver is Henry Winkler.  They are impossible to get past, too.I haven't run into the color correction or compression issues that some other people have noted.  But I will say that the Avid is only a decade or so old.  These were not edited by computer and some of the older techniques and effects can look a little cheesy compared to the bare basics that can be done on a good computer today.I'll be first in line for the season 2 episodes because I like MacGyver and the reruns are so chopped and washed out.

Most of the shows on during the same time (mid 1980s) have already been released (Knight Rider, Magnum PI, etc). For those who don't know, MacGyver (played by Richard Dean Anderson) is a rugged government agent who works by improvising special trinkets and gadgets to get out of sticky situations (instead of using, say, guns). Part private-eye, part environmentalist, think of MacGyver as an ""overgrown Boy Scout"" and you have a pretty good idea of the character.The First Season was on TV in 1985 and although it had a slow start, the ratings soon took off.  In the first season, MacGyver travels all over the world and gets himself out of more than his fair share of trouble.  This show is a classic of the 1980s science/action genre (Knight Rider is another good example), and should be enjoyable to those who remember the series. Unfortunately, the special effects, music, and dialogue (not to mention Richard Dean Anderson's hair styles) may seem a bit campy and dated by today's standards. The computer-effects and digital camerawork that are commonplace in action-packed television shows today were not used in the mid 1980s.

I grew up watching this show from beginning to end and it is so great to see it finally being given a full season by season release on DVD.For anyone who by some unfortunate chance has never gotten to see this show, definitely pick this set up.  (Though I wish Amazon would spell the name right.  The ""G"" is capitalized!)Here's a few reasons why I like this show so much.  Well, okay, the first thing that drew me to the show was the great action and last minute escapes with MacGyverisms.  Amazing what you can do with a Swiss Army Knife, duct tape, and your wits! :-)I really liked the fact that he was against guns, smoking, drugs, and drinking. All in all, MacGyver is a great show that provides plenty of action and entertainment, actual useful knowledge, and a positive role model who portrays good morals. He also was one of the most caring heroes on TV who took time to help others just because they needed help. He really had genuine compassion and kindness towards others. I also like the way that he shook his hand after punching someone. It really showed a human side to him, that it's okay to say ""ow"" when you hurt.

It gets repetitive, but it's still fun to watch an episode or two every once in awhile. If you grew up with Macgyver as a kid, you know how great it was. It was like a 47 minute b-action movie. Sometimes nonstop action. Macgyver made a great debut in it's first season, and would go strong for years after. Season one has a few really good episodes, but my favorite by far is ""Thief of Budapest"". It starts out with a cold intro, meaning it doesn't have anything to do with the episode. Macgyver has to steal back a valuable horse because people may go to war over it. He has a pole vs sword duel on horses with a big mustache guy and Macgyver of course wins, and to top it off he rams his horse into a couple other guys on horses who were circling around him. Then there's something I've never seen before. A helicopter comes flying above Macgyver and has a strap attached to it which Macgyver puts on the horse and the helipcopter flies them away. Breathtaking. Then the episode actually starts. There's an amazing painful looking stunt, a bar fight, a fun car chase with a bunch of Mini Coopers going down stairs and other cool stuff, Macgyver makes out with a hot gypsy woman, he slides down a slanted roof Jackie Chan style, and they don't even use a stunt double. Such an awesome episode.People seem to be mad that the only way you can get the 2 TV movies is to buy the Macgyver complete series box set.  Maybe I'm just one of the few people that don't really care for the Macgyver movies.  I'm happy that I bought all of the seasons seperately.  I've seen the complete series box set and it has like 20 discs all stacked on top of eachother.

It is undoubtedly one of my all-time favourite shows, and I am ecstatic to learn it is finally going to be available on DVD. I can only hope and pray it will be available in Australia, because only one of my DVD players is formatted to play Region 1 disks.MacGyver is a classic action show from the Eighties/early Nineties. It had just about everything - action, adventure, trauma, disaster, triumph, excitement, comedy and even the occasional touch of romance. We have the lead character Angus MacGyver (his first name was finally provided in one solitary episode, much to the character's displeasure), his best friend and boss Pete Thornton, who is head of the Phoenix Foundation, and his nemesis, Murdoch, who pops up every so often with one thought on his twisted mind - kill MacGyver.One of the highlights of the show was watching the title character get out of the tightest jams using seemingly mundane, everyday objects. As a friend pointed out, put a Swiss Army Knife, duct tape and a couple of wires in the guy's hand, and he could blow his way out of Fort Knox.Yes, the show seemed silly at times, but that was half the fun, and it made science fun for those of us ignoramuses who just weren't science-oriented.The beauty of a show like MacGyver was that there were endless possibilities for storylines. I recall a particularly exciting episode in which Mac was employed to break into a hi-tech building in order to test out the new central, sentient computer system. He got in, but then could not get out again when the computer went haywire and tried to kill him for real.In total contrast there was an episode in the same vein as the Harrison Ford film ""Witness"", where he is injured and finds himself recuperating in a small Amish community.Unlike so many shows at the moment that are restricted in their plots and end recycling the same monotonous drivel over and over, MacGyver encompassed such a broad range of subjects that, for me at least, the show never lost interest.It is a relief to know that someone has finally seen fit to put at least the first season on DVD.

Here's the guy who can turn just about anything into an escape or a weapon and save the day. Is it a bit over the top? Sometimes, but that's the fun of it. Are some of the guest stars a bit, oh, wooden? Yep. Are some of the situations just too improbable? Certainly. Are some of the solutions scientifically questionable? Absolutely.What's so much fun about this is watching Richard Dean Anderson. Err, ahh, yes, watching Richard Dean Anderson figure out (that's it!)  a way to foil the bad guy, defuse the bomb (and the situation), turn a paperclip into a weapon. This is just fun to watch again after all these years. RDA is great to watch whether he's covered in muck or decked out in a tux, he's so natural and low-key that some of the guest stars just don't play it the same way and they come off a bit campy, a bit stiff, a bit unnatural. But that's also the fun of it.To sell the show (and it did hang in there for years), you have to have someone like RDA play it seriously. I'm not sure all the guest got the memo, but that's okay. When the producers finally settle in on Pete Thornton as MacGyver's boss and best friend, and tie Mac to the Phoenix Foundation, the stories are grounded a bit more. Otherwise it seems that Mac would be rescuing every person he ever met in his life. Not that I mind. Early MacGyver is like Bond without the gadgets supplied to him. MacGyver turns just about anything into whatever he needs and it's just so much fun to watch him come up with the solutions. Should all of them work?

Hedges,"[2, 2]","Richard Dean Anderson plays secret agent Angus MacGyver, a man so brilliant he can make land mines out of pine cones, he can fix the brakes of a car while it's moving, and he can single-handedly defeat the armed forces of the Soviet Union multiple times, once even in Afghanistan. This is the first season of the series on DVD, and it is impossible not to be entertained and amused by the cheesy irrepressibility of this show.Every week MacGyver gets himself into some kind of impossible jam, but due to his knowledge of, well, pretty much everything, he always manages to escape. I love the episodes with ""opening gambits"", pieces of plot unconnected to the main story that run before the credits to get the episodes up to the proper length for airing on network television. My favorite example of the opening gambit in this set is in ""Deathlock"" in which MacGyver's coffin (which he is cleverly using to escape East Berlin) transforms into a jet ski. It's a sequence that is so ridiculous that I never tire of it.These episodes are all outlandish, fun, and enjoyable. In addition to ""Deathlock"" my other favorite of the set is ""Target MacGyver"", in which MacGyver and his grandfather are targeted by a professional assassin, ""Axminister"", a bad guy who might be more fearsome except he looks for all the world like Al Roker wearing the sunglasses elderly patients wear home after cataract surgery. The only episode I didn't really care for in this set was ""Every Time She Smiles"" which features an actress playing imbecilic actress ""Penny Parker"" in a fracas with the Bulgarian Secret Police. I could almost not make it through this episode due to the extreme grating nature of Penny Parker: obviously MacGyver is truly a man of steel to be able to endure her.This show is off the charts for ridiculous plotlines, but it is fun, entertaining, lightweight entertainment that plays well even today. My only critique of the DVD set is the complete absence of extras, and in the extreme Spartan nature of the menus. Other than wishing from some commentary by Richard Dean Anderson and Henry Winkler, though, this is a great set, and I recommend it for a nostalgic bit of amusing and entertaining television.",5,Only MacGyver Could Turn A Coffin Into A Jet Ski!,1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,2205,"['Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'secret', 'agent', 'Angus', 'MacGyver', 'man', 'so', 'brilliant', 'can', 'make', 'land', 'mines', 'pine', 'cones', 'can', 'fix', 'brakes', 'car', 'moving', 'can', 'single-handedly', 'defeat', 'armed', 'forces', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'multiple', 'times', 'once', 'even', 'Afghanistan', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'DVD', 'impossible', 'not', 'be', 'entertained', 'amused', 'cheesy', 'irrepressibility', 'show.Every', 'week', 'MacGyver', 'kind', 'impossible', 'jam', 'due', 'knowledge', 'well', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'always', 'escape', 'love', 'episodes', 'opening', 'gambits', 'pieces', 'plot', 'unconnected', 'main', 'story', 'credits', 'get', 'episodes', 'proper', 'length', 'airing', 'network', 'television', 'favorite', 'example', 'opening', 'gambit', 'set', 'Deathlock', 'MacGyver', 'coffin', 'cleverly', 'using', 'escape', 'East', 'Berlin', 'jet', 'ski', 'sequence', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'never', 'tire', 'it.These', 'episodes', 'are', 'outlandish', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'addition', 'Deathlock', 'other', 'favorite', 'set', 'Target', 'MacGyver', 'MacGyver', 'grandfather', 'are', 'targeted', 'professional', 'assassin', 'Axminister', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'fearsome', 'world', 'Al', 'Roker', 'wearing', 'sunglasses', 'elderly', 'patients', 'wear', 'home', 'cataract', 'surgery', 'only', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'set', 'was', 'Every', 'Time', 'Smiles', 'actress', 'playing', 'imbecilic', 'actress', 'Penny', 'Parker', 'fracas', 'Bulgarian', 'Secret', 'Police', 'could', 'almost', 'not', 'make', 'episode', 'due', 'extreme', 'grating', 'nature', 'Penny', 'Parker', 'obviously', 'MacGyver', 'truly', 'man', 'steel', 'be', 'able', 'endure', 'her.This', 'show', 'charts', 'ridiculous', 'plotlines', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'lightweight', 'entertainment', 'well', 'even', 'today', 'only', 'critique', 'DVD', 'set', 'complete', 'absence', 'extras', 'extreme', 'Spartan', 'nature', 'menus', 'Other', 'wishing', 'commentary', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'though', 'great', 'set', 'recommend', 'nostalgic', 'bit', 'amusing', 'entertaining', 'television']",N/A

Now it will be fun to watch Macguyver again, season by season, as it's released on DVD. You don't get stuff like this on TV nowadays! A story with basically a positive plot in each episode, where the hero really does succeed, where there are real bad guys, and there isn't all the confusing relativism of TV today (is ANYONE good or bad, or are we all just seeking the understanding of others? and other such rubbish).This collection has no extras, just the episodes. But unlike other reviewers, I'm pleased with the quality of the restoration. On my HDTV, anyway, the quality is top-notch. These old TV shows are recorded in fullscreen 4:3 with mono sound, but on a high-quality TV with a surround system, it's a fun experience (you won't get stereo or surround, though). I noticed no discoloration or any problems with video. The ONLY thing I noticed is the voiceovers are a bit off at times (where RDA obviously over-sampled his dialog in post production, while other actors did not).
