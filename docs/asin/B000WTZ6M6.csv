1112180,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000WTZ6M6,Cubist,"[3, 4]","Since Kurt Cobain's death in 1994, many books have been written about him and his band Nirvana that try to get the real story about the musician and reluctant rock star. Arguably, the best book about him isCome As You Are: The Story of Nirvanaby Michael Azerrad. He was able to get close to Cobain and gain his confidence, recording hours of audio interviews with the man on a wide variety of topics.Director A.J. Schnack has taken these audio-taped conversations and assembled an unorthodox documentary on Cobain entitled About a Son that eschews the usual formula of footage of concerts and talking head soundbites from friends and family for footage of the cities he grew up and lived in: Aberdeen, Olympia, and Seattle.At times, Cobain mentions a band or a song that influenced him and then it plays over the soundtrack which goes against the trend of populating the documentary with Nirvana songs. It's not surprising that Cobain comes across as a very thoughtful commentator about himself and life in general. The audio tapes allow Cobain's disembodied voice to narrate his own story. After awhile, however, watching About a Son is like listening to an audio commentary from beyond the grave.""The Voices Behind About a Son"" features Azerrad talking about how he conducted his interviews with Cobain, how he first met him, and so on. Schnack talks about he met Azerrad and pitched the idea of the film to him. Azerrad had resisted using his Cobain tapes in other projects for years but felt that this one was appropriate.There is a selected scene commentary by director A.J. Schnack. He talks about some of the locations that they shot for the film and their specific connections to Cobain. For example, they were able to shoot in the house where the interviews with him were conducted.Finally, there is ""On Location: Scouting Video to Scene Comparison"" that takes a look at the differences between the location scouting footage and photographs and the final version in the film.",4,Like listening to an audio commentary from beyond the grave.,1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,1984,"['Kurt', 'Cobain', 'death', '1994', 'many', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'band', 'Nirvana', 'try', 'get', 'real', 'story', 'musician', 'reluctant', 'rock', 'star', 'Arguably', 'best', 'book', 'isCome', 'Are', 'Story', 'Nirvanaby', 'Michael', 'Azerrad', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'close', 'Cobain', 'gain', 'confidence', 'recording', 'hours', 'audio', 'interviews', 'man', 'wide', 'variety', 'topics.Director', 'A.J', 'Schnack', 'taken', 'audio-taped', 'conversations', 'assembled', 'unorthodox', 'documentary', 'Cobain', 'entitled', 'Son', 'usual', 'formula', 'footage', 'concerts', 'talking', 'head', 'soundbites', 'friends', 'family', 'footage', 'cities', 'grew', 'up', 'lived', 'Aberdeen', 'Olympia', 'Seattle.At', 'times', 'Cobain', 'band', 'song', 'influenced', 'then', 'soundtrack', 'trend', 'populating', 'documentary', 'Nirvana', 'songs', 'not', 'surprising', 'Cobain', 'across', 'very', 'thoughtful', 'commentator', 'life', 'general', 'audio', 'tapes', 'allow', 'Cobain', 'disembodied', 'voice', 'narrate', 'own', 'story', 'awhile', 'however', 'watching', 'Son', 'listening', 'audio', 'commentary', 'grave', 'Voices', 'Son', 'Azerrad', 'talking', 'how', 'conducted', 'interviews', 'Cobain', 'how', 'first', 'met', 'so', 'Schnack', 'talks', 'met', 'Azerrad', 'pitched', 'idea', 'film', 'Azerrad', 'had', 'resisted', 'using', 'Cobain', 'tapes', 'other', 'projects', 'years', 'felt', 'one', 'was', 'appropriate.There', 'selected', 'scene', 'commentary', 'director', 'A.J', 'Schnack', 'locations', 'shot', 'film', 'specific', 'connections', 'Cobain', 'example', 'were', 'able', 'shoot', 'house', 'where', 'interviews', 'were', 'conducted.Finally', 'Location', 'Scouting', 'Video', 'Scene', 'Comparison', 'look', 'differences', 'location', 'scouting', 'footage', 'photographs', 'final', 'version', 'film']",Kurt Cobain - About a Son
1112181,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B000WTZ6M6,D. Hartley,"[3, 3]","It's nearly impossible to be a pop culture aficionado living here in Seattle and not be reminded of Cobain's profound impact on the music world. Every April, around the anniversary of his death, wreaths of flowers and hand taped notes begin to appear on a lone bench in a tiny  public park sandwiched between the lakefront mansions I pass on my way to work every morning. Inevitably, I will see small groups of young people with multi-colored hair and torn jeans, making their pilgrimage and holding vigil around this makeshift shrine, located a block or two from the home where he took his own life.""About a Son"" is a reflective and uniquely impressionistic portrait of Cobain's short life. There are none of the usual talking head interviews or performance clips here; in fact there is nary a photo image of Cobain or Nirvana displayed until a good hour into the documentary. Nonetheless, director A.J. Schnack is holding an ace; he was given access to a series of surprisingly frank and intimate audio interviews that Cobain recorded at his Seattle home circa 1992-1993. He marries up Cobain's childhood and teenage recollections with beautifully shot footage of his hometown of Aberdeen and its Washington logging country environs. As Cobain's self-narrated life story moves to Olympia, then inevitably to Seattle, Schnack's POV travelogue follows right along. The combination of Cobain's narrative voice with the visuals has an eerie effect; you begin to feel that you are inside Cobain's temporal memories-kicking aimlessly around the depressing cultural vacuum of a blue collar logging town,walking the halls of his high school, sleeping under a railroad bridge,sitting on a mattress on a crash pad floor and practicing guitar for hours on end.The film is almost an antithesis to Nick Broomfield's notorious and comparatively sensationalistic documentary ""Kurt and Courtney"". Whereas Broomfield set out with a backhoe to dig up as much dirt as quickly as possible in attempting to uncover Cobain's story, Schnack opts for a more carefully controlled excavation, gently brushing the dirt aside in order to expose the real artifact. And again, in spite of the relative dearth of actual visual images of its subject, ""About a Son"" succeeds in giving us a thoroughly intimate portrait of the artist. I also should give a nod to the fantastic soundtrack (although Nirvana themselves are conspicuously MIA).

1112182,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000WTZ6M6,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[10, 10]","Unless someone magically comes across one lying in a box somewhere, we are never going to get a Kurt Cobain autobiography. The closest thing we'll get is ""Kurt Cobain - About a Son,"" a documentary cobbled out of Michael Azerrad's interviews with the late rock'n'roll star -- and Cobain both explores his own past and strips away some of his legends.The interviews took place in the early nineties over the course of a few months, about a year before Cobain's tragic death. Some are in person, and a few are over the phone. They're pleasantly informal and laid-back, since Cobain munches on a sandwich during one segment, and is occasionally interrupted by Courtney.Over the course of several interviews, Cobain reflects on his life before rock stardom -- his childhood and his hometown, his formative years of mischief, his love of punk rock, his desire to be a rock star, and the early days of Nirvana. Cobain also contemplated drugs, health problems, his allure to flies, his quirky art, Courtney Love, fatherhood, turtles, misanthropy, death, oregano, journalists (I guess Azerrad was an exception), his bandmates, being onstage, the future of rock'n'roll, and his own reputation.Since the interviews were taped with sound only, director AJ Schnack fills the screen with soundless, strangely ambient images from Seattle, Olympia and Aberdeen. Musicians, stores, logging machines, streets, forests, houses and faces pass by quietly -- as well as some weird cartoons. It feels a little like a nostalgic look through Cobain's own eyes.Cobain himself was a remarkable person who has been overshadowed by his own posthumous legend (even when he was alive). In these interviews, he sounds like an intelligent man sitting down to have a frank conversation with a friend -- he sounds relaxed, laid-back and mostly at peace with his life as it then was, particularly when talking about his child (he recounts how when he saw her in a sonagram, she was making the ""hook 'em horns""). He has a lot of funny anecdotes, and a childlike fascination with the world that is truly endearing.But as the interviews go on, we start seeing the multifaceted, contradictory creature that Cobain was -- darkness/light, loathing/fascination with people, childlike/painfully mature, earnest/jaded, passionate/lazy, craving fame yet somewhat disgusted by it.It's obvious he had learned a lot from his past, since he spends a lot of time analyzing his own youthful mind and how people saw him (""I usually am enjoying myself; I'm hardly ever depressed anymore""). Near the end, he even comments that his own personal problems are not unusual or the worst, showing that he had grown up a lot -- when asked if his was a sad story, Cobain laughs and says, ""No... not really, I mean... it's nothing that's amazing or new, that's for sure.""And Cobain made some eerily prophetic statements as well -- he complains about rock'n'roll (""It's sad to think what the state of rock'n'roll will be in about twenty years from now..."") and discusses death (""If I was gonna blow my head off with a gun, I may as well take the risk of dying from drugs"").""Kurt Cobain: About a Son"" is a bittersweet experience -- it offers some truly beautiful insights into the mind of a true artist, but leaves you wishing he hadn't departed quite so soon.",4,Are you a Martian?,1276732800,"06 17, 2010",2010,3294,"['someone', 'magically', 'one', 'lying', 'box', 'somewhere', 'are', 'never', 'going', 'get', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'autobiography', 'closest', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'get', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'Son', 'documentary', 'cobbled', 'Michael', 'Azerrad', 'interviews', 'late', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'star', 'Cobain', 'own', 'past', 'strips', 'away', 'legends.The', 'interviews', 'took', 'place', 'early', 'nineties', 'course', 'few', 'months', 'year', 'Cobain', 'tragic', 'death', 'are', 'person', 'few', 'are', 'phone', ""'re"", 'pleasantly', 'informal', 'laid-back', 'Cobain', 'munches', 'sandwich', 'one', 'segment', 'occasionally', 'interrupted', 'Courtney.Over', 'course', 'several', 'interviews', 'Cobain', 'life', 'rock', 'stardom', 'childhood', 'hometown', 'formative', 'years', 'mischief', 'love', 'punk', 'rock', 'desire', 'be', 'rock', 'star', 'early', 'days', 'Nirvana', 'Cobain', 'also', 'contemplated', 'drugs', 'health', 'problems', 'allure', 'flies', 'quirky', 'art', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'fatherhood', 'turtles', 'misanthropy', 'death', 'oregano', 'journalists', 'guess', 'Azerrad', 'was', 'exception', 'bandmates', 'being', 'onstage', 'future', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'own', 'reputation.Since', 'interviews', 'were', 'taped', 'sound', 'only', 'director', 'AJ', 'Schnack', 'screen', 'soundless', 'strangely', 'ambient', 'images', 'Seattle', 'Olympia', 'Aberdeen', 'Musicians', 'stores', 'logging', 'machines', 'streets', 'forests', 'houses', 'pass', 'quietly', 'as', 'well', 'weird', 'cartoons', 'little', 'nostalgic', 'look', 'Cobain', 'own', 'eyes.Cobain', 'was', 'remarkable', 'person', 'who', 'been', 'overshadowed', 'own', 'posthumous', 'legend', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'alive', 'interviews', 'intelligent', 'man', 'sitting', 'down', 'have', 'frank', 'conversation', 'friend', 'relaxed', 'laid-back', 'mostly', 'peace', 'life', 'then', 'was', 'particularly', 'when', 'talking', 'child', 'how', 'when', 'saw', 'sonagram', 'was', 'making', 'hook', 'lot', 'funny', 'anecdotes', 'childlike', 'fascination', 'world', 'truly', 'endearing.But', 'interviews', 'go', 'start', 'seeing', 'multifaceted', 'contradictory', 'creature', 'Cobain', 'was', 'darkness/light', 'loathing/fascination', 'people', 'childlike/painfully', 'mature', 'earnest/jaded', 'passionate/lazy', 'craving', 'fame', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'disgusted', 'it.It', 'obvious', 'had', 'learned', 'lot', 'past', 'lot', 'time', 'analyzing', 'own', 'youthful', 'mind', 'how', 'people', 'saw', 'usually', 'am', 'enjoying', ""'m"", 'hardly', 'ever', 'depressed', 'anymore', 'end', 'even', 'comments', 'own', 'personal', 'problems', 'are', 'not', 'unusual', 'worst', 'showing', 'had', 'grown', 'up', 'lot', 'when', 'asked', 'was', 'sad', 'story', 'Cobain', 'laughs', 'not', 'really', 'mean', 'nothing', 'amazing', 'new', 'sure', 'Cobain', 'made', 'eerily', 'prophetic', 'statements', 'as', 'well', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'sad', 'think', 'what', 'state', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'will', 'be', 'twenty', 'years', 'now', 'death', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'blow', 'head', 'gun', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'take', 'risk', 'dying', 'drugs', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'Son', 'bittersweet', 'experience', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'insights', 'mind', 'true', 'artist', 'wishing', 'had', ""n't"", 'departed', 'quite', 'so', 'soon']",Kurt Cobain - About a Son

There are no Nirvana recordings in the film (though you'll hear some classic rock and punk tracks by the likes of Queen, Bowie, The Vaselines, and other acts who inspired Kurt Cobain).  The interviews with Cobain are filled with thoughtful, poignant comments, social commentary, and very candid autobiographical material recorded in the last 2 years before Cobain's death.  The scenery in Washington State ranges from the majestic Cascades and evergreens to the mundane of local clubs, libraries, and unkempt apartments.  The score for this film is actually quite beautiful, it has nice ambient guitar work and is rather haunting, accentuated by the physical absence of Cobain, who appears in the film only in a photo montage near the end.  This is an interesting film and provides much insight into Cobain... it's his interviews that are the foundation of the film, with the visuals just being an artistic overlay.

I was the perfect age for this, coming into my teens with Nirvana and having Kurt Cobain be my patron saint.  However, looking back on that time, perhaps the timing was just perfect for me as well as the rest of the world.  I admired Kurt, but became disillusioned as time went on.  He would die, and I and the rest of the Gen X kids grew up without him.  It was a very special experience, as well as a haunting one to hear his voice from beyond the grave.  What was even more haunting about this was the fact that we hardly see any images of Kurt in the movie, mostly stills of his hometown of Aberdeen and Seattle, and nameless people on the streets.  Kurt was the voice of disillusioned youth that we see on the streets in this film, and in many ways still is.Kurt tells us about his childhood, his teen years, his stomach, his becoming a musician, and his epic rise to fame.  Who better to tell you than the man himself?  Courtney Love, today the infamous tabloid queen she is, is barely in it (thank God), but will always be linked to Kurt and Nirvana's story, nor is Dave or Krist except for a brief mention or photograph here and there.  The voice takes you into his world, making you feel like you are really there with him in his mind.  His alienation and feelings of inadequacy really speak to the viewer, making you feel and understand so many things about him.  There were so many conflicts and feelings to explore, too many to list here in a review.And now, he's gone.  He left us because ... Well, just because.  He left behind his music, he was an artist, he touched people's lives, including mine.  Kurt wanted to give us his statement, and his project ended up being the last great rock band to close out the twentieth century.

1112187,A29I9VL8PQ2G0J,B000WTZ6M6,"N. Hackman ""Dr. Nan""","[0, 1]","First let me say that this is beautifully filmed so I guess it deserves 5 stars. The images of Seattle and environs could almost stand alone as visual commentary on real people of the Northwest. It serves here as a backdrop for a recorded interview with Kurt Cobain. When I got this I was hoping for rare footage of pre-fame performances, interviews with people who knew him along the way, etc.  I am speculating that the producers of this film were unable to get the rights to any Kurt Cobain material other than the recorded interview. This is obviously a well-intentioned film, but for me it just didn't work, either as a tribute, or as a documentary. I was never a Nirvana fan but I like their music when I hear it. I had hoped this film would make me a believer. Without his music, or footage of him performing (or any footage of Kurt Cobain at all for that matter) etc., voice-over Cobain sort of comes off as a somewhat petulant, whiny individual, although his honesty is refreshing.

1112188,A1WJB8XX7ZC9H9,B000WTZ6M6,"Nicole Domini ""Nicole Domini""","[14, 22]","I had actually been really excited about seeing this film.  I was 18 in 1992 and just idolized Nirvana.  Sixteen years later I still have a soft spot in my heart for Kurt Cobain.This film was ridiculously terrible!  In my opinion, it had no business being a film.  The substance of the movie comes from taped conversations between Michael Azerrad and Kurt Cobain that Azerrad used for his book Come As You Are:  The Story of Nirvana.  With the prodding of Azerrad's interview questions, Cobain reveals facets of his personality, interesting anecdotes about his life, and insight into the person he was.However, AJ Schnack adds NOTHING to the story by turning this material into a film.  Sure, there are a few generic shots of the neighborhood where Cobain grew up, where his father worked, and other places Cobain frequented, but this could easily be shown as photographs.  In my opinion, Azerrad himself should have released the tapes and included a booklet of photographs of Cobain's haunts, of Cobain himself, as this is all this film really is.But the rest of the fluff Schnack added, in my opinion, was plain stupid and annoying!  For example, when Cobain would be telling a story that happened in a library, you would be listening to his voice, but then looking at the inside of a library.  I know what a library looks like, I don't feel like I need such obvious visual cues!  The same thing would occur when Cobain would be telling a story that happened in school, a lumberyard... wherever.  I didn't feel like looking at the halls of a high school or a bunch of logs being moved really added anything to the story.What I found the most irritating, though, was the way Schnack would take have these random people look, with forced sad and empty expressions on their faces, at the camera and just stand there.  I felt this was Schnack's sorry attempt to be artistic.  I felt like he was trying really hard to make an artistic statement with these people (who I guess were supposed to represent ""everyday Americans"", ""alienated youth"", and the like), but it really just didn't seem to have anything to do with Kurt Cobain and the story he was revealing.  Perhaps if these shots had been of kids in the 90s, dressed the way we did those days, like the kids in the video for ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", it would have seemed relevant.  But they were just people living and looking like they do in the first decade of the 21st century, and I have no idea what this was supposed to do with Kurt Cobain.Of course, there is no music by Nirvana in the entire film; I believe I heard he couldn't get the rights to the music from the people who now own it.  Sure, it was interesting to hear the music that influenced Cobain, but what a movie about him with none of his actual work just seems empty.My last complaint about the film has to do with the printed words at the end of the film that claim Cobain committed suicide a year later.  From my understanding, Cobain only allegedly committed suicide.  There is a lot of evidence that suggests a certain person had Cobain murdered.  A film about Kurt Cobain, I would think, should at least set forward truthful, verifiable information about him.This film is worth renting (don't make the mistake of buying it, like I did) just to hear Cobain's stories in his own voice.  But don't expect to gain much from the visual content from the film.  In fact, I feel it may have been more enjoyable to simply have listened to it with the screen turned off.",2,Disappointing...

Ryan ""American Hit Network""","[0, 0]","If you were hoping for a second chance to crawl inside the mind of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, this is it, but the experience may not be quite what you expected it to be. As a documentary, ""About a Son"" is about as rewarding as it is frustrating. On one hand, it offers unparalleled access to Cobain's thoughts, since it is compiled exclusively from interview tapes. On the other hand, the video footage plays like a Travel Channel documentary for the State of Washington. You get to hear the contradictory nature of Cobain as he discusses points of inspiration and frustration, but there is virtually none of Nirvana's music to support his commentary. For the first hour, you don't even get to see Cobain's face, not even in photos. Instead, the film juxtaposes scenic shots of Washington with seemingly random faces from the area, as an attempt at capturing Cobain's environment.""About a Son"" compiles the psychological profile of a happy kid sliding into neurosis, depression and anti-social behavior. Cobain is forthcoming, but his own self-doubt and suspicious nature forces the viewer to question the degree of his honesty. His take on his own victimization is self-evident, but his view on his own self-perceived shortcomings and his drug use are dependent on his ability to be honest with himself. He claims that chronic digestive pain inspired thoughts of suicide, but later says ""I hadn't had any stomach pain when I started doing drugs."" Is that the truth, or is it a rationalization? The film doesn't answer the question so much as it presents the contradiction for the viewer's own interpretation. Ultimately, ""About a Son"" is a psychological study consisting of self-analytical interviews juxtaposed over third-party footage. Does it succeed? That depends entirely on your ability to suspend your own frustration.

1112192,A1XBYZX09V1OB4,B000WTZ6M6,Valerie J. Saturen,"[52, 56]","It is hard to find a single figure that looms larger in recent rock history than Kurt Cobain. It's harder still to come across an artist whose true nature was so obscured, even distorted, by his own legend. About a Son, based on interviews with Come as You Are author Michael Azzerad, offers a rare, sincere, and deeply moving glimpse into Cobain's private world. In the process, it reveals a side of the late musician often left out of sensationalized media portrayals of his life, drug use, and tragic end--he is perceptive, thoughtful, and quietly articulate, reflecting on his experiences with a candor unmatched in other interviews.What makes the film unusual among documentaries is director AJ Schnack's determination to stay out of the way and allow Cobain to tell his own story. Eschewing the typical documentary format in which the viewer's gaze is focused on the subject, About a Son creates the sense of looking out through Kurt's eyes, seeing the images he would have seen and hearing the music he listened to. There are no Nirvana songs--just the music that inspired and influenced Cobain--and the visuals are a montage of evocative images of Aberdeen, Olympia, and Seattle. Listening to Kurt's sleepy, gravelly narration (most of the interviews were conducted in the wee hours of the morning) against the backdrop of these images elicits the feeling of taking a long stroll and talking intimately with an old friend.As you stroll through Washington streets slicked with rain, passing floating bundles of Aberdeen timber, punk rock Olympia kids, and the city lights of Seattle, Kurt talks about his parents' divorce, his lifelong sense of isolation, the unexpected consequences of fame, and his unabashed devotion to his wife and daughter. He tells of a life clearly fraught with pain and depression, yet fueled with creative passion. The personality he reveals is one of contradictions: the desire for recognition vs. the desire for solitude; deep concern for humanity vs. revulsion toward humanity's darker side; a harsh reality vs. a longing for the simplicity of childhood.About a Son is as much a portrait of the Pacific Northwest as it is a rendering of Kurt Cobain. Alongside breathtaking cinematography, Cobain's narrative shows that many of these private contradictions were the product of a deep-seated ambivalence toward his environment. As a child, he was alternately comforted and stifled by small-town Aberdeen; as a budding artist, he was nurtured by Olympia's creativity, yet felt like an outsider; in his Seattle days, he helped place the city on the musical map while deriding media hype about the ""grunge scene.""As the lone figure of Cobain fades at the film's end, one cannot help but feel the loss of an extraordinary artist--and an extraordinary individual--as he vanishes from sight.",5,Kurt Cobain in His Own Words,1196640000,"12 3, 2007",2007,2819,"['hard', 'find', 'single', 'figure', 'larger', 'recent', 'rock', 'history', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'harder', 'still', 'come', 'artist', 'true', 'nature', 'was', 'so', 'obscured', 'even', 'distorted', 'own', 'legend', 'Son', 'based', 'interviews', 'Come', 'Are', 'author', 'Michael', 'Azzerad', 'rare', 'sincere', 'deeply', 'moving', 'glimpse', 'Cobain', 'private', 'world', 'process', 'side', 'late', 'musician', 'often', 'left', 'out', 'sensationalized', 'media', 'portrayals', 'life', 'drug', 'use', 'tragic', 'end', 'perceptive', 'thoughtful', 'quietly', 'articulate', 'reflecting', 'experiences', 'candor', 'unmatched', 'other', 'film', 'unusual', 'documentaries', 'director', 'AJ', 'Schnack', 'determination', 'stay', 'way', 'allow', 'Cobain', 'tell', 'own', 'story', 'Eschewing', 'typical', 'documentary', 'format', 'viewer', 'gaze', 'focused', 'subject', 'Son', 'sense', 'looking', 'out', 'Kurt', 'eyes', 'seeing', 'images', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'hearing', 'music', 'listened', 'are', 'Nirvana', 'songs', 'just', 'music', 'inspired', 'influenced', 'Cobain', 'visuals', 'are', 'montage', 'evocative', 'images', 'Aberdeen', 'Olympia', 'Seattle', 'Listening', 'Kurt', 'sleepy', 'gravelly', 'narration', 'most', 'interviews', 'were', 'conducted', 'wee', 'hours', 'morning', 'backdrop', 'images', 'elicits', 'feeling', 'taking', 'long', 'stroll', 'talking', 'intimately', 'old', 'friend.As', 'stroll', 'Washington', 'streets', 'slicked', 'rain', 'passing', 'floating', 'bundles', 'Aberdeen', 'timber', 'punk', 'rock', 'Olympia', 'kids', 'city', 'lights', 'Seattle', 'Kurt', 'parents', 'divorce', 'lifelong', 'sense', 'isolation', 'unexpected', 'consequences', 'fame', 'unabashed', 'devotion', 'wife', 'daughter', 'life', 'clearly', 'fraught', 'pain', 'depression', 'yet', 'fueled', 'creative', 'passion', 'personality', 'one', 'contradictions', 'desire', 'recognition', 'vs.', 'desire', 'solitude', 'deep', 'concern', 'humanity', 'vs.', 'revulsion', 'humanity', 'darker', 'side', 'harsh', 'reality', 'vs.', 'longing', 'simplicity', 'childhood.About', 'Son', 'as', 'much', 'portrait', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'rendering', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'Alongside', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'Cobain', 'narrative', 'shows', 'many', 'private', 'contradictions', 'were', 'product', 'deep-seated', 'ambivalence', 'environment', 'child', 'was', 'alternately', 'comforted', 'stifled', 'small-town', 'Aberdeen', 'budding', 'artist', 'was', 'nurtured', 'Olympia', 'creativity', 'yet', 'felt', 'outsider', 'Seattle', 'days', 'helped', 'place', 'city', 'musical', 'map', 'deriding', 'media', 'hype', 'grunge', 'scene', 'lone', 'figure', 'Cobain', 'fades', 'film', 'end', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'loss', 'extraordinary', 'artist', 'extraordinary', 'individual', 'sight']",Kurt Cobain - About a Son
