Fortunately the holiday specials are out (and on the DVDs include extra shows). I'm still waiting for The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show from 1983 to hit DVD. Some viewers didn't like it, but I did because even when it missed (and it often hit) it had the same pacing as the comic (as did Garfield and Friends which began in 1988) which is so distinctive of the best Peanuts specials.These eight specials ran on Nick under the umbrella title ""You're on Nickelodeon, Charlie Brown"" and made it out on VHS. This double DVD set saves more than $60 off the cost of the VHS videos. Pardon the 'e' word, but it's very educational. The shows are very different one from another. I very much liked the NASA space station show, which is sort of like a Peanuts take on the History Channel. But this set costs less than two of the VHS tapes, so it's like you get six shows free.Of the 75 half hour Peanuts specials, some of the best had an educational bent, such as ""What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown?"" about D-Day, which won a Peabody Award. The four best known specials are the feature length ones: ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"", ""Snoopy Come Home"", ""Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown"" and ""Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown"". Then there was the live action Broadway musical, ""You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,"" which I saw recently in its current revival. Charles Schultz didn't originally like the name ""Peanuts"" which was foisted on him by the syndicate. But like that addictive snack food, at least some of us can't get enough of his comic creations. Here's hoping more of them make it to DVD soon.",4,Miss Othmar would be proud.,1158105600,"09 13, 2006",2006,1639,"['Let', 'face', 'Peanuts', 'been', 'slow', 'getting', 'DVD', 'Fortunately', 'holiday', 'specials', 'are', 'DVDs', 'include', 'extra', 'shows', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Snoopy', 'Show', '1983', 'hit', 'DVD', 'viewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', 'because', 'even', 'when', 'missed', 'often', 'hit', 'had', 'same', 'pacing', 'comic', 'did', 'Garfield', 'Friends', 'began', '1988', 'so', 'distinctive', 'best', 'Peanuts', 'specials.These', 'eight', 'specials', 'ran', 'Nick', 'umbrella', 'title', ""'re"", 'Nickelodeon', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'made', 'out', 'VHS', 'double', 'DVD', 'set', 'more', '60', 'cost', 'VHS', 'videos', 'Pardon', 'e', 'word', 'very', 'educational', 'shows', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'one', 'very', 'much', 'liked', 'NASA', 'space', 'station', 'show', 'sort', 'Peanuts', 'take', 'History', 'Channel', 'set', 'less', 'two', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'get', 'six', 'shows', 'free.Of', '75', 'half', 'hour', 'Peanuts', 'specials', 'best', 'had', 'educational', 'bent', 'such', 'What', 'Have', 'Learned', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'D-Day', 'won', 'Peabody', 'Award', 'four', 'best', 'known', 'specials', 'are', 'feature', 'length', 'ones', 'Boy', 'Named', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Snoopy', 'Come', 'Home', 'Race', 'Your', 'Life', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Bon', 'Voyage', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Then', 'was', 'live', 'action', 'Broadway', 'musical', ""'re"", 'Good', 'Man', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'saw', 'recently', 'current', 'revival', 'Charles', 'Schultz', 'did', ""n't"", 'originally', 'name', 'Peanuts', 'was', 'foisted', 'syndicate', 'addictive', 'snack', 'food', 'least', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'comic', 'creations', 'Here', 'hoping', 'more', 'make', 'DVD', 'soon']",N/A

976711,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B000EQ5Q18,Lesley Aeschliman,"[3, 4]","In the late 1980's, eight Peanuts specials were produced where the Peanuts gang were able to become a part of historical events.  Each disc contains four of the specials.  Disc one contains ""The Mayflower Voyagers"" (which is also available on the original DVD pressing of A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving), ""The Birth of the Constitution,"" ""The Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk,"" and ""The NASA Space Station.""  Disc two contains ""The Building of the Transcontinental Railroad,"" ""The Great Inventors,"" ""The Smithsonian and the Presidency,"" and ""The Music and Heroes of America.""Unfortunately, all you get on these DVDs are the specials themselves.  There are absolutely no special features included.  I personally think there were plenty of options that Paramount could have used as bonus features (such as interviews with individuals who worked on these specials, commentary tracks, or trivia that ties in to the topics presented in each special).The specials themselves are very informative, but they definitely have a different style when compared to the typical Peanuts specials.  Expect younger children to become bored with these specials rather quickly.  Older children can probably better understand them and can probably have a better appreciation for them, but even they may grumble a little when watching these.I applaud what was trying to be accomplished by producing these specials, but I think adult fans of the Peanuts will overall have a greater appreciation and enjoyment for them than children will.I wrote this review of the copy of this set that my husband and I purchased.",3,"These may not necessarily be entertaining for kids, but they're educational",1290038400,"11 18, 2010",2010,1585,"['late', '1980', 'eight', 'Peanuts', 'specials', 'were', 'produced', 'where', 'Peanuts', 'gang', 'were', 'able', 'become', 'part', 'historical', 'events', 'disc', 'four', 'specials', 'Disc', 'one', 'Mayflower', 'Voyagers', 'also', 'available', 'original', 'DVD', 'pressing', 'A', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Thanksgiving', 'Birth', 'Constitution', 'Wright', 'Brothers', 'Kitty', 'Hawk', 'NASA', 'Space', 'Station', 'Disc', 'two', 'Building', 'Transcontinental', 'Railroad', 'Great', 'Inventors', 'Smithsonian', 'Presidency', 'Music', 'Heroes', 'America', 'Unfortunately', 'get', 'DVDs', 'are', 'specials', 'are', 'absolutely', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'personally', 'think', 'were', 'plenty', 'options', 'Paramount', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'bonus', 'features', 'such', 'interviews', 'individuals', 'who', 'worked', 'specials', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'trivia', 'ties', 'topics', 'presented', 'special', '.The', 'specials', 'are', 'very', 'informative', 'definitely', 'have', 'different', 'style', 'when', 'compared', 'typical', 'Peanuts', 'specials', 'Expect', 'younger', 'children', 'become', 'bored', 'specials', 'rather', 'quickly', 'Older', 'children', 'can', 'probably', 'better', 'understand', 'can', 'probably', 'have', 'better', 'appreciation', 'even', 'may', 'grumble', 'little', 'when', 'watching', 'these.I', 'applaud', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'accomplished', 'producing', 'specials', 'think', 'adult', 'fans', 'Peanuts', 'will', 'overall', 'have', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'enjoyment', 'children', 'will.I', 'wrote', 'review', 'copy', 'set', 'husband', 'purchased']",N/A

That has been the feeling with the Peanuts cast for so many eras. While the comic strips the late Charles Schultz have drawn for all throughout his lifetime, and until his retirement in 2000, continue to entertain al ages, the televisions specials have also gained a lot into the light as well such as A Charlie Brown Christmas, and Snoopy's Reunion. When it came to the moments of history, Schultz put them as if they were at those gracious eras too. Now, that series is on DVD for the first time.This Is America Charlie Brown, the 1988 eight episode series take so many great moments as told by Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus and the rest of the Peanuts gang. The collection includes special moments from the original flights at Kitty Hawk from the Wright Brothers, to the moments of NASA and the history of space, and the moment the pilgrims have stepped off The Mayflower. The collection of episodes from the CBS mini-series has been restored very well, and the animation looks and sounds better than ever. It still continues to enetertain for all ages, and portraits a lot of history that still hasn't been described enough in classrooms today.All in all, This Is America Charlie Brown is a great DVD package for anybody who loves the Peanuts series from television, or for anyone who hasn't yet read even the comic strips.

976715,A1S2H07AYAZ5E4,B000EQ5Q18,Robert G. Ernst,"[0, 0]","I remember watching these when I was a kid. The specific ones I remember were: Transcontinental Railroad, Mayflower Voyagers, Wright Brothers, and very little of the inventors one.Those 3 alone are a good reason to get it. I specifically remember as a kid being more engaged in learning that history because it had my favorite characters on the big screen telling me about it and I could retain that information better than a social studies textbook. Parents should get this for their kids so they can learn American History, and Peanuts fans should get this too.That concludes my review but there is one scene I want to have addressed and want someone to respond to confirm this or deny it.When I watched Mayflower Voyagers as a kid and compared that to watching it on tv today or on a holiday collection dvd, there was a distinct difference.I specifically remember the scene where Squanto (excuse the spelling) leads the indians to the turkey that they have later for dinner. He points at the turkey, says shh, then the turkey disappears in a cloud of smoke. My parents were good and told me straight that they shot the turkey and the smoke means he died.On the dvd, squanto says shh and it stays on his face the entire time the turkey is shot.A difference as small as that can be very annoying to a die hard peanuts fan as myself. So what I'm wondering for anyone that owns this set (because I want to at some point) is: does the turkey get shot or not on the This is American dvd set?",4,Very Informative,1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,1488,"['remember', 'watching', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'specific', 'ones', 'remember', 'were', 'Transcontinental', 'Railroad', 'Mayflower', 'Voyagers', 'Wright', 'Brothers', 'very', 'little', 'inventors', 'one.Those', '3', 'alone', 'are', 'good', 'reason', 'get', 'specifically', 'remember', 'kid', 'being', 'more', 'engaged', 'learning', 'history', 'had', 'favorite', 'characters', 'big', 'screen', 'telling', 'could', 'retain', 'information', 'better', 'social', 'studies', 'textbook', 'Parents', 'should', 'get', 'kids', 'can', 'learn', 'American', 'History', 'Peanuts', 'fans', 'should', 'get', 'review', 'one', 'scene', 'want', 'have', 'addressed', 'want', 'someone', 'respond', 'confirm', 'deny', 'it.When', 'watched', 'Mayflower', 'Voyagers', 'kid', 'compared', 'watching', 'tv', 'today', 'holiday', 'collection', 'dvd', 'was', 'distinct', 'difference.I', 'specifically', 'remember', 'scene', 'where', 'Squanto', 'spelling', 'indians', 'turkey', 'have', 'later', 'dinner', 'turkey', 'shh', 'then', 'turkey', 'cloud', 'smoke', 'parents', 'were', 'good', 'told', 'straight', 'shot', 'turkey', 'smoke', 'dvd', 'squanto', 'shh', 'face', 'entire', 'time', 'turkey', 'shot.A', 'difference', 'as', 'small', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'annoying', 'die', 'hard', 'peanuts', 'fan', 'what', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'anyone', 'set', 'want', 'point', 'turkey', 'get', 'shot', 'not', 'American', 'dvd', 'set']",N/A

In it, Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Peppermint Patty, Sally, Lucy, Linus, Marcie and others travelled back in time to witness events like the dreary Mayflower voyage, the signing of the Constitution, Ben Franklin discovering electricity, the Depression of the 1930's, the building of the Transcontinental Railroad and the Wright brothers' 1st flight.  In addition, the Peanuts gang took a trip in outer space, travelled to the Smithsonian Institution, paid tribute to many American musicians like Scott Joplin and Stephen Foster and got to meet George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Henry Ford, Squanto, Alexander Graham Bell and others.  Some ""purists"" may object to the showing of adults in an animated special but the caricatures of some of the famous historical figures look like something Charles Schulz would've drawn.  This features music from Dave Brubeck, George Winston, the Winans, Lou Rawls, Ed Bogas, Wynton Marsalis, David Grusin and David Benoit (and of course, lots of standards from the late Vince Guaraldi).
