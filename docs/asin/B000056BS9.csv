If any of you have seen his many NBA highlight tapes, this movie will not provide anything different enough to warrant a purchase.  Also, for a documentary there is not enough insight from his teammates, once again providing nothing new for the Jordan fans.

That was always exciting for me as a Jordan fan. Hearing it in Dolby Digital 5.1 with the lights out and a flashlight and hearken back to the glory days. Of all the Jordan videos to date, this DVD clearly has the best sound mix.But this fairly short documentary itself is fairly bland. It follows the Bulls and Jordan during his last season, through the finals against the Jazz and Jordan's career-ending (for now, at least), game-winning shot in which he gave Bryon Russell a spank and then drained that jumper. Not much here that most fans don't already know. If you're a real Jordan and hoops fan, wait for the Jordan DVD box set which should have more footage from all throughout his career.

Make no mistake: MJ to the Max is an IMAX movie, and you'll be very disappointed when you see it at home. About half of the movie has these really annoying picture-in-picture shots, which take up maybe 25% of the screen, and made me feel like I was watching streaming videos on the web. I'm sure this ""technique"" worked fine on a 80-foot-high screen, but it definitely doesn't on a regular TV.In terms of the content, the movie also disappoints.  It's nothing more than a rehash of ESPN highlights, except that it is shot at awkward angles and further away from the action. Again, this may have worked on a huge IMAX screen, but certainly not on a regular TV. The movie also fails to provide any in-depth behind-the-scenes material.My 2 cents: Save your money unless 1) you are a die-hard MJ fan, and/or 2) you have a really really REALLY big TV.",2,Do you have a big TV?,982195200,"02 15, 2001",2001,945,"['mean', 'really', 'REALLY', 'big', 'TV', 'answer', 'then', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'get', 'DVD/VHS', 'Make', 'mistake', 'MJ', 'Max', 'IMAX', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'when', 'see', 'home', 'half', 'movie', 'really', 'annoying', 'picture-in-picture', 'shots', 'take', 'up', 'maybe', '25', '%', 'screen', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'watching', 'streaming', 'videos', 'web', ""'m"", 'sure', 'technique', 'worked', 'fine', '80-foot-high', 'screen', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'regular', 'TV.In', 'terms', 'content', 'movie', 'also', 'nothing', 'more', 'rehash', 'ESPN', 'highlights', 'shot', 'awkward', 'angles', 'further', 'away', 'action', 'Again', 'may', 'have', 'worked', 'huge', 'IMAX', 'screen', 'certainly', 'not', 'regular', 'TV', 'movie', 'also', 'provide', 'in-depth', 'behind-the-scenes', '2', 'cents', 'Save', 'money', '1', 'are', 'die-hard', 'MJ', 'fan', 'and/or', '2', 'have', 'really', 'really', 'REALLY', 'big', 'TV']",N/A

I have to be completely honest here: &quot;Michael Jordan to the Max&quot; is somewhat boring.
