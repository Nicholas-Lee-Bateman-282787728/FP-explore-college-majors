726005,A356RFKNIG043B,B00007AJE8,K. Swanson,"[2, 2]","Certainly one of Sellers' weirdest roles, Hoffman contains some of the most strangely acerbic lines I've ever heard in such a seemingly low-key film. While both Sellers and Cusack are good, the real star here is the script by Ernest Gebler, based on his play. Every few minutes Sellers utters yet another bizarrely true statement that is almost always oddly hilarious, and also somehow unsettling when delivered by Sellers in his deadpan way.It's hard not to laugh at Sellers even when he's serious; like Bill Murray, his face is just funny, even in repose. Or maybe it's just one's memory of all the laughs that face has produced. Either way, what are supposed to be somewhat serious lines here take on odd overtones, and the entire film is truly strange, even creepy, until the rather cheesy end.The fact is, Sellers has blackmailed this secretary at his job into living with him for a week. Uh, that's a major felony, right? But here it's all played as a lark, and Cusack barely protests at the quasi-rape aspect. Imagine if this film was made today! But it all passes as innocuous, and as she predictably begins to fall for his semi-sophistication, the whole monstrous nature of the affair seems to recede. I had trouble getting past that; sexual blackmail morphing into a light romantic comedy?In any case, Sellers makes the most of his many startling lines here and delivers a performance unique in his canon, both serious and ironic, and one senses that he identifies strongly with this character. Which is pretty odd, seeing as how weird Hoffman is. It gets rather slow about an hour in and is 15 minutes too long for my taste, and I'm a huge Sellers fan. It's certainly worth watching for Sellers devotees, and is more of a very black comedy than any sort of romance, which makes the denouement all the dimmer.A much weirder yet eventually more boring film than most reviews here suggest, Hoffman is good. But it's no masterpiece by a long shot, and I'd rate it well down the list of Sellers' best, beneath Heavens Above, the PP movies, Being There, and a number of others.",4,"""Miss Smith?

726006,A2O6JWJS6EEI6D,B00007AJE8,"L. Camuti ""moviequeen""","[4, 5]","Along with Being There, Dr. Strangelove, a rarity called The Optimists and Lolita, this ranks among Peter Sellers' finest dramatic performances. As the story unfolds, fans who know Sellers only as Inspector Clouseau from the Pink Panther films may wonder, even recoil, at his choice of this role. For, although Benjamin Hoffman is an ostensibly respected, successful businessman, at an emotional and personal level he is a desperate, devious and downright nasty guy who is blackmailing his secretary to spend a week in his bed. He hopes, anyway--and expects, for the purpose of a consummated union. As if the currency of his physical demands could satisfy his emotional bills.Why, indeed, did Peter Sellers want us to care about this apparently despicable fellow? Why, as always, does he use humor to humanize and expose the vulnerability and sensitivity of this otherwise unlikable chap?  Why does he want us to look deeper, to understand that beneath Hoffman's embittered surface lie hopes, dreams, a heart that was betrayed?For years, Sellers claimed publicly that his own identity eluded him; that, if asked to play himself, he would not have the first idea how to do so. His choice of the role of Benjamin Hoffman is a resounding testament as close to an admission of self-perception as you're likely to find. I believe that he did recognize his own shortcomings, but he could only admit them to himself from the safe distance of a role.In any case, this is a really beautiful performance from Sellers. How bold it must have been, by late 1960s standards, to portray with such depth the loneliness, desperation, borderline neurosis of a man facing middle age alone. The chemistry between Sellers and Sinead Cusack as the young and reluctant secretary is terrific. And as always, Sellers brings to bear his amazing insight into human frailty to make us laugh, to redeem this tortured soul, Hoffman.If you're looking for a movie with something deeper than the technology-laden plots and superficially written characters we see all too often these days, have a look at this. The ending, albeit dreamily optimistic, is heartwarming and hopeful, and I think you'll find you do care about Hoffman.",5,A soul-baring character study from the man who claimed he didn't know himself,1159833600,"10 3, 2006",2006,2196,"['Being', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'rarity', 'called', 'Optimists', 'Lolita', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'finest', 'dramatic', 'performances', 'story', 'unfolds', 'fans', 'who', 'know', 'Sellers', 'only', 'Inspector', 'Clouseau', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'films', 'may', 'wonder', 'even', 'recoil', 'choice', 'role', 'Benjamin', 'Hoffman', 'ostensibly', 'respected', 'successful', 'businessman', 'emotional', 'personal', 'level', 'desperate', 'devious', 'downright', 'nasty', 'guy', 'who', 'blackmailing', 'secretary', 'spend', 'week', 'bed', 'anyway', 'purpose', 'consummated', 'union', 'currency', 'physical', 'demands', 'could', 'satisfy', 'emotional', 'bills.Why', 'indeed', 'did', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'want', 'care', 'apparently', 'despicable', 'fellow', 'Why', 'always', 'use', 'humor', 'humanize', 'expose', 'vulnerability', 'sensitivity', 'otherwise', 'unlikable', 'chap', 'Why', 'want', 'look', 'deeper', 'understand', 'beneath', 'Hoffman', 'embittered', 'surface', 'lie', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'heart', 'was', 'betrayed', 'years', 'Sellers', 'claimed', 'publicly', 'own', 'identity', 'eluded', 'asked', 'play', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'first', 'idea', 'how', 'do', 'so', 'choice', 'role', 'Benjamin', 'Hoffman', 'resounding', 'testament', 'close', 'admission', 'self-perception', ""'re"", 'likely', 'find', 'believe', 'did', 'recognize', 'own', 'shortcomings', 'could', 'only', 'admit', 'safe', 'distance', 'role.In', 'case', 'really', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'Sellers', 'How', 'bold', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'late', '1960s', 'standards', 'portray', 'such', 'loneliness', 'desperation', 'borderline', 'neurosis', 'man', 'facing', 'middle', 'age', 'alone', 'chemistry', 'Sellers', 'Sinead', 'Cusack', 'young', 'reluctant', 'secretary', 'terrific', 'always', 'Sellers', 'bear', 'amazing', 'insight', 'human', 'frailty', 'make', 'laugh', 'redeem', 'tortured', 'soul', 'Hoffman.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'something', 'deeper', 'technology-laden', 'plots', 'superficially', 'written', 'characters', 'see', 'too', 'often', 'days', 'have', 'look', 'ending', 'dreamily', 'optimistic', 'heartwarming', 'hopeful', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'do', 'care', 'Hoffman']",Hoffman
