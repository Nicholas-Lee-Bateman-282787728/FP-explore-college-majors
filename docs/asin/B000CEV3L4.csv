957632,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000CEV3L4,calvinnme,"[9, 9]","Usually makers of a boxed set of films featuring one artist will put at least one bad or mediocre film in with the rest. This is not the case with this boxed set. All of the films are excellent, and there are featurettes included for all of the movies. Only His Girl Friday gets a commentary track though.This is the Region 1 debut of Holiday on DVD. It pairs Katherine Hepburn with Cary Grant in a film that is a bit out of step with its time (1938) in that it ponders the wisdom of endlessly pursuing wealth at a time when such thoughts were considered almost un-American. Grant plays a man who becomes engaged to a woman and only later finds out she is the member of a fabulously wealthy family and that he, once a part of the family, will be expected to go to work in the family business and count money for the rest of his life. This is out of step with Grant's character's view on what he wants his future to be, but in step with his fiancee's sister's view of life played by Hepburn.Extras:Cary at Columbia featuretteDeleted Scenes PhotographsOnly Angels Have Wings (1939) pairs Grant with Jean Arthur. This is a drama/romance with only a few light moments in which Grant plays a pilot and the manager of a small burgeoning South American airline. Arthur is an entertainer who meets Grant and decides he is interesting enough that she wants to know him better so she intentionally misses her boat back to the states. Add in the complication of Grant's old flame (Rita Hayworth) showing up as the wife of a disgraced pilot who is looking for a second chance, and you have the makings of a very good film.Extras:""Angels: Made in Heaven"" featuretteThe Talk of the Town (1942) is another chance for Grant to play working class hero opposite Jean Arthur. This time he is a fugitive from justice, falsely accused of torching a factory and causing the death of a factory worker. He decides to hide out in Arthur's home, but the complication is that a famous law professor (Ronald Coleman) has rented the home for the summer and wants nothing but peace and quiet while he writes a book. He winds up with anything but that. This film is a good blend of drama and comedy.Extras:Talking About ""Talk of the Town"" featuretteThe Awful Truth (1937) pairs Cary Grant with Irene Dunne in a screwball comedy about a couple that divorces but finds that they really are meant for each other. They spend the whole film sabotaging both their own and each others' romances until they both realize ""the awful truth"". This film allows Cary to be the well-dressed sophistocate who also does some great pieces of physical comedy. The plot also involves the couple's dog, including a bit of detective work involving a tell-tale oversized hat that would make The Thin Man's Asta proud.Extras:In Love with Cary Grant featuretteInside ""The Awful Truth"" featuretteThe best known film of the bunch is probably ""His Girl Friday"" (1940). This pairs Grant with Rosalind Russell who plays Hildy - Grant's ex-wife and his best reporter. Hildy is leaving the paper and leaving town to become the wife of an Albany insurance agent played by Ralph Bellamy, a man who always plays it safe. Grant's character uses the approaching execution of a man who may be innocent to try and lure Hildy back to the paper and back to him. Poor Ralph Bellamy. This is the second time in this boxed set that he has played a man who obviously doesn't stand a chance against Grant's charms and cunning, the first time being in The Awful Truth.Extras:Commentary TrackOn Assignment: ""His Girl Friday"" featuretteOne of the featurettes mentions that among the stars of the 1930's very few seem to transcend time, and Cary Grant is one of those very few. That's because he didn't really belong to any one era. He was also very fortunate that, after a very few years making some rather mediocre films at Paramount, he was able to negotiate a contract allowing him to work for two studios - RKO and Columbia. These are indeed some of his finest films while at Columbia, and the set is very much worth checking out.",5,A great set of movies with some terrific extra features,1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,4054,"['Usually', 'makers', 'boxed', 'set', 'films', 'featuring', 'one', 'artist', 'will', 'put', 'least', 'one', 'bad', 'mediocre', 'film', 'rest', 'not', 'case', 'boxed', 'set', 'films', 'are', 'excellent', 'are', 'featurettes', 'included', 'movies', 'Only', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'commentary', 'track', 'though.This', 'Region', '1', 'debut', 'Holiday', 'DVD', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'film', 'bit', 'step', 'time', '1938', 'wisdom', 'endlessly', 'pursuing', 'wealth', 'time', 'when', 'such', 'thoughts', 'were', 'considered', 'almost', 'un-American', 'Grant', 'man', 'who', 'engaged', 'woman', 'only', 'later', 'out', 'member', 'fabulously', 'wealthy', 'family', 'once', 'part', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'expected', 'go', 'work', 'family', 'business', 'count', 'money', 'rest', 'life', 'step', 'Grant', 'character', 'view', 'what', 'future', 'be', 'step', 'fiancee', 'sister', 'view', 'life', 'played', 'Hepburn.Extras', 'Cary', 'Columbia', 'featuretteDeleted', 'Scenes', 'PhotographsOnly', 'Angels', 'Have', 'Wings', '1939', 'Grant', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'drama/romance', 'only', 'few', 'light', 'moments', 'Grant', 'pilot', 'manager', 'small', 'burgeoning', 'South', 'American', 'airline', 'Arthur', 'entertainer', 'who', 'Grant', 'decides', 'interesting', 'enough', 'know', 'better', 'intentionally', 'boat', 'back', 'states', 'Add', 'complication', 'Grant', 'old', 'flame', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'showing', 'up', 'wife', 'disgraced', 'pilot', 'who', 'looking', 'second', 'chance', 'have', 'makings', 'very', 'good', 'film.Extras', 'Angels', 'Made', 'Heaven', 'featuretteThe', 'Talk', 'Town', '1942', 'chance', 'Grant', 'play', 'working', 'class', 'hero', 'opposite', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'time', 'fugitive', 'justice', 'falsely', 'accused', 'torching', 'factory', 'causing', 'death', 'factory', 'worker', 'hide', 'out', 'Arthur', 'home', 'complication', 'famous', 'law', 'professor', 'Ronald', 'Coleman', 'rented', 'home', 'summer', 'nothing', 'peace', 'quiet', 'book', 'up', 'anything', 'film', 'good', 'blend', 'drama', 'comedy.Extras', 'Talking', 'Talk', 'Town', 'featuretteThe', 'Awful', 'Truth', '1937', 'pairs', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'couple', 'really', 'are', 'meant', 'other', 'spend', 'whole', 'film', 'sabotaging', 'own', 'others', 'romances', 'realize', 'awful', 'truth', 'film', 'Cary', 'be', 'well-dressed', 'sophistocate', 'who', 'also', 'great', 'pieces', 'physical', 'comedy', 'plot', 'also', 'couple', 'dog', 'including', 'bit', 'detective', 'work', 'involving', 'tell-tale', 'oversized', 'hat', 'would', 'make', 'Thin', 'Man', 'Asta', 'proud.Extras', 'Love', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Awful', 'Truth', 'featuretteThe', 'best', 'known', 'film', 'bunch', 'probably', 'Girl', 'Friday', '1940', 'Grant', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'who', 'Hildy', 'Grant', 'ex-wife', 'best', 'reporter', 'Hildy', 'leaving', 'paper', 'leaving', 'town', 'become', 'wife', 'Albany', 'insurance', 'agent', 'played', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'man', 'who', 'always', 'safe', 'Grant', 'character', 'approaching', 'execution', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'innocent', 'try', 'lure', 'Hildy', 'back', 'paper', 'back', 'Poor', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'second', 'time', 'boxed', 'set', 'played', 'man', 'who', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'Grant', 'charms', 'cunning', 'first', 'time', 'being', 'Awful', 'Truth.Extras', 'Commentary', 'TrackOn', 'Assignment', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'featuretteOne', 'featurettes', 'mentions', 'stars', '1930', 'very', 'few', 'seem', 'transcend', 'time', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'belong', 'one', 'era', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'fortunate', 'very', 'few', 'years', 'making', 'rather', 'mediocre', 'films', 'Paramount', 'was', 'able', 'negotiate', 'contract', 'allowing', 'work', 'two', 'studios', 'RKO', 'Columbia', 'are', 'indeed', 'finest', 'films', 'Columbia', 'set', 'very', 'much', 'checking', 'out']",The Cary Grant Boxed Set: (Holiday / Only Angels Have Wings / The Talk of the Town / His Girl Friday / The Awful Truth)

957635,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,B000CEV3L4,Douglas M,"[1, 1]","This is the pick of the box sets of Cary Grant's films except if you are crazy about Alfred Hitchcock. All the films were made at Columbia between 1938 and 1942. Harry Cohn ran that studio with an iron fist but as one historian notes in one of the featurettes, he allowed directors to have control and here we have 4 of the best - Howard Hawks x2, Leo McCarey, George Stevens and George Cukor.Not only is Grant superb in every film, but he is paired with 4 peerless leading ladies - Irene Dunne, Katharine Hepburn, Jean Arthur x2 and Rosalind Russell. Three of the scripts are based on plays - ""Holiday"", ""His Girl Friday"" and ""The Awful Truth"". ""Holiday"" is a freewheeling comedy with a message. ""Friday"" is the brilliant reworking of ""The Front Page"" with a gender change and ""Truth"" one of the peaks of the screwball genre. ""Only Angels have Wings"" is a ripping adventure and ""The Talk of the Town"" is a moody misfire combining comedy, romance and a message in the vein of Frank Capra.All of the prints are good, the weakest being ""Holiday"". Each film has a featurette, most of which tell more about Grant and the directors than the films themselves. I think they would have been improved if combined into one documentary. ""His Girl Friday"" contains a worthwhile commentary notable for its succint delivery, in contrast to the often verbose dissertations on most DVDs. You can actually watch the film AND listen to the commentary for once. Theatrical trailers are included and there is selected marketing material, notably for a Frank Capra DVD collection of Columbia films.These are films which still stand up today - mostly good stories, great casts and excellent production values. This is Hollywood at its most entertaining and accomplished.",5,Outstanding box set - perfect entertainment,1287964800,"10 25, 2010",2010,1748,"['pick', 'box', 'sets', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'films', 'are', 'crazy', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'Columbia', '1938', '1942', 'Harry', 'Cohn', 'ran', 'studio', 'iron', 'fist', 'one', 'historian', 'notes', 'one', 'featurettes', 'allowed', 'directors', 'have', 'control', 'here', 'have', '4', 'best', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'x2', 'Leo', 'McCarey', 'George', 'Stevens', 'George', 'Cukor.Not', 'only', 'Grant', 'superb', 'film', 'paired', '4', 'peerless', 'leading', 'ladies', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'x2', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'Three', 'scripts', 'are', 'based', 'plays', 'Holiday', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'Awful', 'Truth', 'Holiday', 'freewheeling', 'comedy', 'message', 'Friday', 'brilliant', 'reworking', 'Front', 'Page', 'gender', 'change', 'Truth', 'one', 'peaks', 'screwball', 'genre', 'Only', 'Angels', 'have', 'Wings', 'ripping', 'adventure', 'Talk', 'Town', 'moody', 'misfire', 'combining', 'comedy', 'romance', 'message', 'vein', 'Frank', 'Capra.All', 'prints', 'are', 'good', 'weakest', 'being', 'Holiday', 'film', 'featurette', 'most', 'tell', 'more', 'Grant', 'directors', 'films', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'combined', 'one', 'documentary', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'worthwhile', 'commentary', 'notable', 'succint', 'delivery', 'contrast', 'often', 'verbose', 'dissertations', 'most', 'DVDs', 'can', 'actually', 'watch', 'film', 'AND', 'commentary', 'once', 'Theatrical', 'trailers', 'are', 'included', 'selected', 'marketing', 'material', 'notably', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Columbia', 'films.These', 'are', 'films', 'still', 'stand', 'up', 'today', 'mostly', 'good', 'stories', 'great', 'casts', 'excellent', 'production', 'values', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'entertaining', 'accomplished']",The Cary Grant Boxed Set: (Holiday / Only Angels Have Wings / The Talk of the Town / His Girl Friday / The Awful Truth)

Here are 5 of Grants' early films and a few are among his best. This set is a nice start for anyone wanting to get to know the very talented Cary Grant. He had a look and style that will never be duplicated. He excelled at romantic comedies but could also show a serious side. He never got the awards and acclaim he deserved but he left us a fine legacy of film.We have Grant in his glorious youth. Vibrant and energetic, he seems to enjoy acting and working with his costars and directors. The films in this box set appear to have been remastered and the black and white films are crisp, clean and clear. Although each film does have extra features, it is a disappointment that they are so minimal. They usually have the film trailer and an advertisement for the Frank Capa or another film series. It's the Featurettes that are worth the time. They may be short but are packed with insight into Cary Grant and his style of acting along with information on the films' directors and costars. Director George Stevens son shared some experiences on one featurette. Film historians and director Peter Bogdanovich shared insight. The featurettes are worth the time but it's a disappointment they are so short.This is a fine collection for a Cary Grant fan and a good beginning set for people who are unfamiliar with this wonderful actor.",5,GREAT COLLECTION OF CLASSIC CARY GRANT FILMS,1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,1469,"[""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'films', 'collection', 'individually', 'wanted', 'comment', 'actual', 'collection', 'called', 'THE', 'CARY', 'GRANT', 'BOX', 'SET', 'Here', 'are', '5', 'Grants', 'early', 'films', 'few', 'are', 'best', 'set', 'nice', 'start', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'get', 'know', 'very', 'talented', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'had', 'look', 'style', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'duplicated', 'excelled', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'could', 'also', 'show', 'serious', 'side', 'never', 'got', 'awards', 'acclaim', 'deserved', 'left', 'fine', 'legacy', 'film.We', 'have', 'Grant', 'glorious', 'youth', 'Vibrant', 'energetic', 'enjoy', 'acting', 'working', 'costars', 'directors', 'films', 'box', 'set', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'remastered', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'are', 'crisp', 'clean', 'clear', 'film', 'have', 'extra', 'features', 'disappointment', 'are', 'so', 'minimal', 'usually', 'have', 'film', 'trailer', 'advertisement', 'Frank', 'Capa', 'film', 'series', 'Featurettes', 'are', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'short', 'are', 'packed', 'insight', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'style', 'acting', 'information', 'films', 'directors', 'costars', 'Director', 'George', 'Stevens', 'son', 'shared', 'experiences', 'one', 'featurette', 'Film', 'historians', 'director', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'shared', 'insight', 'featurettes', 'are', 'time', 'disappointment', 'are', 'so', 'short.This', 'fine', 'collection', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'fan', 'good', 'beginning', 'set', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'wonderful', 'actor']",The Cary Grant Boxed Set: (Holiday / Only Angels Have Wings / The Talk of the Town / His Girl Friday / The Awful Truth)
957641,A1RTDKE3B2A235,B000CEV3L4,J. Dunn,"[16, 71]","I had to respond to the previous review.  I think this is the perfect place to point out the greed of the movie studios.  Why else would they release a box set where 4 of the 5 titles were previous available?  Also, see the new Mel Brooks box set.  You will have to buy that just to get titles such as ""High Anxiety"" and ""Silent Movie"".  How about the deluxe Scarface edition from a few years ago, that was the only way to get the original Scarface (1932) on DVD.  There are many more examples. Don't get me started on the habit or releasing special editions only months after the first edition came out.

957649,A1BVCH82W0M2W2,B000CEV3L4,"Paul Tognetti ""The real world is so much more...","[2, 2]","Count me a lifelong fan of Cary Grant.  I have have always enjoyed his work be it in the screwball comedies of the 1930's and 1940's or his impressive dramatic roles in films like the Hitchcock classic ""North By Northwest"".  A while back I happened upon ""The Cary Grant Box Set"". The price was right so without giving it a second thought I snapped it right up.  Believe me I have not been disappointed. What impressed me most about this collection is the disparate roles Grant plays in these films. It has always amazed me how Grant is able to switch gears with such ease. Here is a brief synopsis of each film:""Only Angels Have Wings""  For me this was perhaps the most surprising film of the bunch.  In this 1939 movie directed by Howard Hawks our hero plays the role of Geoff Carter, a pilot and the owner of a struggling air transport company in Columbia. He is not a very likable person. Carter's airline is vying for a lucrative contract to transport mail over the Andes mountains.  This is exceptionally dangerous work and Carter must make tough and unpopular decisions.  Planes crash and pilots die but this is simply a cost of doing business in such a remote and mountainous region.  Somebody has to do it and Geoff Carter is bound and determined it is going to be his airline.  A very different role for Grant I thought. Also starring Jean Arthur and Rita Hayworth.""The Talk of The Town""  In this film, Grant plays Leopold Dilg, a mill worker and political activist.  When the mill burns down and a man is killed Dilg is accused by the owner of setting the fire.  The fix is in and Dilg is all but certain to be convicted of arson and murder and will no doubt be executed.  But Dilg escapes from custody and injures his leg in the process.  He turns up at a house owned by an old flame Miss Nora Shelley (Jean Arthur).  At first she is frightened by the encounter but Miss Shelley quickly becomes sympathetic to his plight and scrambles to help him in any way she can.  Matters are greatly complicated because Miss Shelley has rented this house to a law professor named Michael Lightcap (Ronald Colman). When Lightcap shows up all hell breaks loose and the results are positively hilarious.  One thing leads to another and Miss Shelley introduces Dilg to the professor as the gardener.  The two become quite friendly and engage in deep philosophical discussions.  Directed by George Stevens this is a film that will capture your attention at the outset and hold it until the final scene.  Outstanding!""Holiday""  I had never heard of this 1938 film but I must tell you that this one is an absolute delight.  Grant plays the role of Johnny Case who has fallen in love with Julia Seton (Doris Nolan).  Now Johnny is a self-made man and Julia is the daughter of a wealthy industrialist.  Julia and her dad have big plans for Johnny but Johnny is not buying.  He meets Julia's sister Linda (Katherine Hepburn) who is sort of the ""black sheep"" of the family and does not share the rest of her family's desire for wealth and power.  And as you have probably guessed by now Johnny evnetually falls for Linda. Directed by George Kukor I thought that this was a five star film all the way.""The Awful Truth""  Both Jerry Warriner (Grant) and his wife Lucy (Irene Dunn) are convinced that their spouse is cheating on them.  And with very  good reason.  Looks like their marriage is on the rocks and the couple files for divorce.  The decree will become official in 90 short days.  In the meantime both get engaged to other people.  But something is gnawing at both Jerry and Lucy.  Seems that the prospect of a divorce has made each of them realize that they just can't live without the other after all. But neither will come out and admit it. Instead they go about trying to sabotage each others relationship with hilarious results. For me the highlight of this film is when Lucy crashes a party at the home of Jerry's new fiancee.  The interaction between Grant and Dunne in this scene is positively priceless.  Many consider ""The Awful Truth"" to be the best of the so-called ""screwball"" comedies that Grant appeared in. Personally, I prefer both ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" and ""My Favorite Wife"" to this one but this is a terrific flick as well.""His Girl Friday""  I became an instant fan of this film the first time I saw it decades ago on television. I always loved movies about the newspaper racket and this one is among the best of the bunch. Grant is the conniving newspaper Walter Burns who is is dealing with the imminent loss of his star reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) who just also happens to be his ex-wife.  Hildy has one foot out the door when a major story breaks. Poor Hildy can't resist covering just one more big story and leaves her fiancee high and dry while she chases down every lead she can find. And of course Walter is pulling out all the stops to make sure that Hildy forgets all about ""what's his name"" and gets the story. The interplay between Grant and Russell is hilarious with the two trading barbs at a sometimes breath-taking pace. Grant and Russell succeed in turning what might otherwise have been a rather ordinary film into something quite special.As you might expect with such a collection ""The Cary Grant Box Set"" includes a number of featurettes with each of the five films.  Another nice touch is the inclusion of 10 collectable postcards featuring vintage photos.  This is a collection that is well worth the money.

energy,charm,charisma and an understated depth and range in his acting.This collection from Columbia is a great showcase for Grant and a must have for all of his fans.There are five films included here;Holiday,Only Angels Have Wings,The Talk of the Town,His Girl Friday and The Awful Truth.All are top notch and delightful films in their own rights and have strong leading ladies for Grant to play with.Holiday is a film which I have not seen for some 35 years and it was a welcome sight.But as others have noted before me it is not available as a seperate release,and I can see why the film execs have NOT picked it as such;it ranges from good condition to poor.This film has been restored through UCLA using material from their archives,Columbia and The Library of Congress.And when one has to get elements from three seperate sources,the alarm bells go off in my head.To start with from the opening credits to a good 15 minutes into the film,the picture seems slighly cropped,that is to say, we seem to be looking closer at everything than we should.Heads are precariously close to the top of the frame.Compare this to the other films and you'll see what I mean.Also there is a scene where Hepburn meets Cary's friends.I got the impression the friends got a little too cosy with her a little too quickly than they should have,possibly as a result of some slight footage being left out.When you have to get your build elements from three different sources then the odds are a)neither source has a complete print(or a decent working one) and b)some film may be left out/lost.But this is only my impressions/oppinions.Most of the other films are generally in very good condition,some a little more grainy than others but good nonetheless.If I was to rate them all from the best to the worst,as far as condition goes,I would put Only Angels Have Wings and The Talk of Town in a two way tie for first,His Girl Friday and The Awful Truth in a two way tie for second and Holiday as a more distant third.As I mentioned previously Grant's range can not be stated enough.He plays everything from a husband going through a divorce,a jungle pilot,a newspaper editor,a disenchanted husband to be and an innocent criminal on the lamb.All are embued with Grant's ineffable charm and charisma and the humour that plays out in each film is of a quite human and realistic nature.It is the latter that helps draw the viewer into the film and makes them care about the characters much more than they otherwise would.Two of the directors Leo McCary and George Stevens(The Awful Truth and The Talk of the Town respectively)are directly descended from working very closely with Laurel and Hardy.That type of humanistic,realistic,gentle and very funny humour is evident throughout those films especially.And no matter where the plots go,and some get pretty serious at times,they always in the end stay the steady course knowing in the end Grant's character will end on a little higher note than he began.This set of five DVDS comes in a big slipcase with fold out holders.You will have no complaints as to the discs coming loose.In fact I have to say if anything these discs are a little TOO tight(I thought I'd never say that!).I had a devil of a time trying to get them out.Each DVD has one or two short featurettes on its' pertinent film but nothing much else worthy of note.There are a nice set of 10 cards included;five lobby repros and five pub pics;very nice.In conclusion,most of the films have been transferred well with Holiday having the worst number of deficiencies,as noted.But for all you Cary Grant fans and lovers of good films,these are five must haves ready and waiting for you all in one place.",4,This is the Cary Grant I will always remember!,1229817600,"12 21,

Then I took 3 of the doubled new discs to a used CD/DVD shop and they gave me $5.00 cash for two and $8.00 for ""Awful Truth"" and I sold the fourth to a friend for $10.00 which meant I got ""Holiday"" for $10.00 and everything in a nice slip-case to boot which ain't bad. For fun, see if you can do better--at worst you'll spend $18 for ""Holiday"" and once you have it in the player you won't find yourself complaining much.This is a wonderful collection and for anyone who enjoys screwball comedy (and close approximations) of the 30's and 40's it's a must have. As the years pass it's getting more and more obvious that Cary Grant occupied a unique leading man/comic-great position that no one will ever top. His Girl Friday and The Awful Truth alone are two of the best in this genre (and the others ain't bad either).",5,Enough wit dah complainin'!
