791465,AMT4LVO5IOMIC,B00012FNB8,Amber,"[80, 81]","I was diagnosed with hypoactive thyroid over a year ago and was put on medication. Once on the medication, if I ever missed a day, the next day would be a disaster. I would be completely exhausted.I started Yoga Cleanse for my liver on new years day and immediatley felt like my thyroid improved. I actually had to miss two days of medication because my prescription ran out over the holidays and I still felt better then ever, I couldn't believe it. We then got Fat Free Yoga, because of the ""life is in your glands"" chapter"". We have other Ravi and Ana CD's, but these two are my favorites.I knew my thyroid was improving because my pulse rate went from 44 to a more normal 64.I have never written a review on amazon, and told my wife that if my blood work proved my thyroid levels improved I would write one. So here I am! My bloodwork is back and my doctor has completly taken me off my medication.. everything is normal!! There is no telling how long I've lived with a hypoactive thyroid, I now have more energy then ever!!!Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!P.S.  My father-in-law who is from India and has practiced yoga for most of his life is now a true believer in Kundalini Yoga, and believe me, he IS NOT easily impressed!!  He now incorporates Kundalini Yoga into his work out every other day.  A lot of the reviews mention that these DVD's are great for beginners.

791468,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00012FNB8,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[65, 68]","Although I tend to practice mostly hatha yoga, I have tried a couple of Ana and Ravi's newer DVDs and have liked them, and I thought it might be nice to add another Kundalini video to my collection.  In particular, I was hoping to find a practice that would leave me feeling energized plus would offer shorter workouts for when I have less time, and after wading through the reviews on Ana and Ravi's older workouts, I thought that Yoga Cleanse might fit the bill.  Yoga Cleanse is divided into three segments:  a 11.5 minute warm-up, an 18-minute ""Love Your Liver"" segment, and finally, a 25 minute ""Tear Out the Toxins"" segment.  The segments flow nicely into each other, but there is a brief pause between each section, and the menu also allows you to select them individually.  The first thing that I noticed when I began the workout is that the production quality is not quite as impressive as with Ana and Ravi's newer DVDs.  Ana is seated in the middle of a somewhat dim studio, and at the start of the practice, Ravi is seated off to the side.  Ravi remains on screen to lead Ana through the opening meditation (Om Namu Guru Dev Namu), but for the majority of the practice, the camera focuses on Ana alone.  Also different from the new practices is that Ravi alone provides the voiceover instruction; Ana does not speak at all throughout the workout.As mentioned above, the warm-up begins with a chanting meditation and then moves into a series of moving stretches that includes stomach grinds, neck rolls, and cat/cow.  The final exercise incorporates Breath of Fire (BOF) while lying on your back with both your head and feet raised.  You then relax on your back for a few moments before rolling up to a seated position for the next segment, Love Your Liver.  In this section, you will be working to stimulate your liver function, and so you will repeatedly return to a position of lying on your left side, right leg raised in the air with hand clasping your left foot, and the perform BOF in this position.  Other exercises in this segment include transitioning from a seated to standing position without using your hands, bending over so that your torso is parallel to the floor and engaging in BOF, and twisting from side-to-side in a seated position while performing BOF through a curled tongue.  I found the final segment, Tear Out the Toxins, to be the most intense.  Virtually all of the exercises are dynamic movements (eg, vigorously moving your arms up and down, twisting from side to side), and you continue to perform BOF through a curved tongue, which I found tiring after awhile.  After 18 minutes of active practice, the last 5.5 minutes of this segment consist of a 2-minute singing meditation and then a 3.5-minute relaxation and final meditation (Ravi again appears on screen for the final few minutes).When I tried this video for the first time, it was at the end of the long week, when I was feeling completely tired and worn out.  Afterward, I wasn't exactly rejuvenated, but I definitely felt better, and I wasn't nearly as fatigued as I had been.  Although Ravi and Ana aren't quite as polished here as they are in their more recent productions, they do a good job with this DVD, and I definitely look forward to using it regularly in the future.  Overall, I enjoyed this practice and would rate it 4 1/2 stars.",4,Very nice kundalini yoga practice leaves you feeling refreshed,1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,3344,"['tend', 'practice', 'mostly', 'yoga', 'have', 'tried', 'couple', 'Ana', 'Ravi', 'newer', 'DVDs', 'have', 'liked', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'nice', 'add', 'Kundalini', 'video', 'collection', 'particular', 'was', 'hoping', 'find', 'practice', 'would', 'leave', 'feeling', 'energized', 'would', 'offer', 'shorter', 'workouts', 'when', 'have', 'less', 'time', 'wading', 'reviews', 'Ana', 'Ravi', 'older', 'workouts', 'thought', 'Yoga', 'Cleanse', 'might', 'fit', 'bill', 'Cleanse', 'divided', 'three', 'segments', '11.5', 'minute', 'warm-up', '18-minute', 'Love', 'Liver', 'segment', 'finally', '25', 'minute', 'Tear', 'Toxins', 'segment', 'segments', 'flow', 'nicely', 'other', 'brief', 'pause', 'section', 'menu', 'also', 'select', 'individually', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'when', 'began', 'workout', 'production', 'quality', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'impressive', 'Ana', 'Ravi', 'newer', 'DVDs', 'Ana', 'seated', 'middle', 'somewhat', 'dim', 'studio', 'start', 'practice', 'Ravi', 'seated', 'side', 'Ravi', 'screen', 'lead', 'Ana', 'opening', 'meditation', 'Om', 'Namu', 'Guru', 'Dev', 'Namu', 'majority', 'practice', 'camera', 'Ana', 'alone', 'Also', 'different', 'new', 'practices', 'Ravi', 'alone', 'voiceover', 'instruction', 'Ana', 'not', 'speak', 'workout.As', 'mentioned', 'warm-up', 'begins', 'chanting', 'meditation', 'then', 'series', 'moving', 'stretches', 'stomach', 'grinds', 'neck', 'rolls', 'cat/cow', 'final', 'exercise', 'Breath', 'Fire', 'BOF', 'lying', 'back', 'head', 'feet', 'raised', 'then', 'relax', 'back', 'few', 'moments', 'rolling', 'up', 'seated', 'position', 'next', 'segment', 'Love', 'Liver', 'section', 'will', 'be', 'working', 'stimulate', 'liver', 'function', 'so', 'will', 'repeatedly', 'return', 'position', 'lying', 'left', 'side', 'right', 'leg', 'raised', 'air', 'hand', 'clasping', 'left', 'foot', 'perform', 'BOF', 'position', 'Other', 'exercises', 'segment', 'include', 'transitioning', 'seated', 'standing', 'position', 'using', 'hands', 'bending', 'over', 'so', 'torso', 'parallel', 'floor', 'engaging', 'BOF', 'twisting', 'side-to-side', 'seated', 'position', 'performing', 'BOF', 'curled', 'tongue', 'found', 'final', 'segment', 'Tear', 'Toxins', 'be', 'most', 'intense', 'Virtually', 'exercises', 'are', 'dynamic', 'movements', 'eg', 'vigorously', 'moving', 'arms', 'down', 'twisting', 'side', 'side', 'continue', 'perform', 'BOF', 'curved', 'tongue', 'found', 'tiring', 'awhile', '18', 'minutes', 'active', 'practice', 'last', '5.5', 'minutes', 'segment', 'consist', '2-minute', 'singing', 'meditation', 'then', '3.5-minute', 'relaxation', 'final', 'meditation', 'Ravi', 'again', 'screen', 'final', 'few', 'minutes', '.When', 'tried', 'video', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'end', 'long', 'week', 'when', 'was', 'feeling', 'completely', 'tired', 'worn', 'out', 'Afterward', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'rejuvenated', 'definitely', 'felt', 'better', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'fatigued', 'had', 'been', 'Ravi', 'Ana', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'polished', 'here', 'are', 'more', 'recent', 'productions', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'look', 'forward', 'using', 'regularly', 'future', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'practice', 'would', 'rate', '4', '1/2', 'stars']",Yoga Cleanse - Lighten Up & Purify - with Ana Brett & Ravi Singh

791471,AWGD0ACATDBKT,B00012FNB8,"Cobra Chick ""Miss Tea""","[9, 9]","I discovered Kundalini Yoga about 3 months ago, and Raviana DVD's are by far my favorite. This older DVD is also amongst my favorites with its primitive studio, primitive lighting and bad sound. There is something magical about it, so go beyond all the flaws and let it work for you (LOL, I thought EMS was visiting my neighbor again the first couple times I did it until I realized the sirens were on the soundtrack...)After 40+ years of not exactly living a healthy lifestyle, I got on the straight and narrow and changed my ways, however am concerned about the damage I may have done. I'm not entirely convinced fasting and juice cleanses and the like are entirely healthy either, and this seems to be a good way of cleansing the body and mind, at least psychologically, without causing further harm to one's self. I do this, and always feel a little ill afterwards for a bit like it has had a detox effect. I made sure to drink a lot of fluids to flush the garbage out, and I feel better. Much better. I don't know, this may be all in my mind, but you know what? I'm okay with that! I feel like I've done something valuable and healthy for myself.Before purchasing these DVD's, I read a lot of reviews and also purchased DVD's by Maya Feinnes & Gurmukh. I didn't care for the other DVD's. I noted a lot of comments about Ana's attire. As I am also into physical fitness, I appreciate the fact that I can see what muscles she is using, or conversely relaxing, in a pose so that I can accurately attempt to copy it. I could not do this with the other DVD's due to the loose fitting clothing or long flowing garments. Also, to me, Kundalini Yoga is about turning inward and focusing on me for a couple of hours a week, not worrying about what someone is wearing. My biggest concern with the Raviana DVD's has been where do I get one of those furry rugs :-)",5,I just love this!

I was very excited to get this DVD, but I don't know if I can even use it again; it was stressful going through it the first time.Each of the other DVDs is of the highest quality; the set bright, light, open and clear.  The instruction clear and peaceful in either Ana's sweet gentle voice, or Ravi's peaceful voice.  This vid is very different in unsettling ways.First, the ""studio"" is an open warehouse with glaring fluorescent lights.  These lights are diminished and during the actual class, there is a dark background with an odd spotlight in the back behind Ana.  It is sort of gloomy and eerie looking, which is enhanced by the background noise of sirens making you feel that this was taped in a bad area of town at night.  The spoken lesson by Ravi is not as smooth as usual and that wouldn't be bad, but the setting and mood have already changed the quality of the potential.  The musical background is also less than smooth - think of a cassette tape playing in the background that needs to be occasionally restarted because you got to the end of side one.The lesson is excellent, and I wish that instead of transferring this to DVD, they would have redone the DVD anew keeping the lesson, but changing the quality to that of their newer works.If it were not that I already practically worship these two people and I already know how wonderful their work is, this DVD may have prevented me from trying any of their others.  As it is, this particular DVD is sitting on my table with me glaring at it, unable to muster up enough to do it again.  Argh, I could ignore the visuals, because I've done enough that I don't need to watch it; but, I cannot get past the sirens in the background.**  Well, I finally got back into it and am glad.  I still wouldn't suggest buying it as your first Raviana DVD, and I still don't like some of the visuals, still notice the sirens, but can ignore these things now.

I still do my Hatha and Astanga, but for getting my engery going and feeling that I am doing wonders for cleansing my body, you can not beat Kundalini Yoga.  Ravi has a wonderful soothing voice, not irritating nor condesending.  He explains exactly what the excersizes purpose is and Ana executes it for you to see how it should be done.  No downward dogs here, nor the usual poses you would expect.  This is yoga in the traditional sense of doing a set (Kriya) and then doing corpse pose and then doing another set.  This is meant to expand your mind and cleanse your organs and create flexability in your back and spine.

791479,A2V202NMFIDMYC,B00012FNB8,Patricia Brune,"[4, 4]","I am a newcomer to the school of Kundalini Yoga.  A fellow fitness enthusiast gave me my first RaviAna DVD, ""Fat Free Yoga - Lose Weight & Feel Great"" approximately a year ago.  I was skeptical about it because I'd heard Kundalini is so different from the traditional schools of hatha and flow yoga I enjoy regularly.  But, having an open mind I popped that first DVD in - and became immediately hooked.In the year since, I've accumulated nine more of Ravi and Ana's DVDs, including Yoga Cleanse.  Lately I have been enjoying the routines on this DVD more and more.  As my Kundalini practice has grown, the exercises have become easier for me to do and now I feel the full benefits of these routines.This video has been reviewed in detail; I will focus on what it does for me.  In a nutshell:  I feel wonderful after completing a routine.  Typically I will do the warmup then choose either one of the two primary sections - Love Your Liver or Tear Out the Toxins, then proceed to the remainder of the DVD.  In this way I can get in a shorter routine and still have time for the other activities I enjoy.  After I get up and begin to go about my day, I have the most serene feeling, I'm breathing deeply and well, have a smile on my face and I just feel good all over.There have been some criticisms about this DVD having poor production/being filmed in a warehouse, or a weird beam of light over Ana.  I really don't notice it.  I prefer the spare backgrounds of the older RaviAnas, I find it more meditative.  Besides my eyes are closed for most of it.  I really like seeing Ravi at the beginning and the end, too.  My only problem with this DVD was that at first, the breathing exercises through the curled tongue were very hard for me to sustain.  After getting Yoga House Calls and finding this type of breathing again in the Anti-Arthritis segment, suddenly it clicked.  I keep a water bottle near me and take a quick sip to help with the dryness, then move on.  After a few sessions this type of breathing does become easier.  I don't know how it works, but it does!!!

791480,A2OWR5G2OAQF7C,B00012FNB8,Sincerely Yours,"[24, 24]","Over the past few months I have acquired a few of Ravi and Ana's dvds, and this one adds another great dimension and benefits of kundalini yoga.  Typical layout is a good warmup ( a must) and then 2x half an hour exercises.  Part I focuses on the liver and part II is more general but a greater workout of your toxins.  These exercises are not stretch exercises, which the total stretch dvd is an absolute must.  Regardless, I have noticed over the past few months working on these dvds that:a) my energy level has risen (had noticed how much it had fallen since being directly affected by 9/11)b) my liver yin was stagnant and hence my period has been very irratic and painful.  Now the flow has improved within a month.c) stress has been a prominant component of my life in the past few months and the dvd has helped to calm my nerves and remove the toxin build-up.I am busy person and try and do one of the dvds 3x a week with particular focus at the weekend.  The dvds also allow you to do a shorter version if you are pushed for time.  I am usually a runner by choice but these dvds have really been a much better alternative: you feel you have had an aeorbic workout, feel the sense of relaxation and less damage to my knees.  Believe me, I sweat through most of these exercises and I would consider myself to be in fairly good shape.This could well be an great alternative to accupuncture that also works on the energy/meridian lines of the body; and release of toxin in your body without the use of medicines.
