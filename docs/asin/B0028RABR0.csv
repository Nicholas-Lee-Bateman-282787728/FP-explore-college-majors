Pity she got replaced by Tanya whats her name. The best part is this is the final three episodes with Farrah Fawcett, rest in peace by the way, The one of her spots i look forward to seeing again is when her Jill Monroe character appears to have turned to a life of crime. The perfect way to remember Farrah, but the other shows like Truckin Angels, and the best one of al Angel Hunt will be well worth seeing again and again.UPDATEAfter looking at season four i can really get into some of the episodes that i had not gotten into before. I will also say that there are many who say that CherylLadd was given some grief for being that ""replacement"" angel, but seriously, it was Shelly Hack that really got screwed by the producers in the long run. Looking at her in the series, and especially at the solo episodes, she was in ( Angels on Campus, Ghosts and Angels) she was a really great actress and very classy all around. She is really like a fine wine, you just got to appreciate her over time. I also really get into the episode Avenging Angel which i did not like at first because you see the streetwise side of the character Kelly Garret like never before, and that it takes on the dark side of drug addiction like no other piece of film in its time ever did. Had Shelly Hack been given more airplay in the beginning she might had lasted another season.

While seasons 1-3 are often seen, many TV stations don't invest much time to the last 2 seasons of the show. I remember a Charlie's Angels marathon on TV Land around the release of the first major movie remake of the show. If you didn't see them in the wee hours of the morning you were out of luck. They showed season's 1-3 a couple of times but not so for seasons 4&5. No matter what anyone says the last 2 seasons are just as good and just as fun as the first two season. I have read that they got rid of Shelly Hack because she could not act. That makes me laugh because on this show none of the girls could act. Then they went and replaced her with Tanya Roberts who we all know is a great actress! lol - The shows included in season 4 & 5 are some of the most fun and wildly campy shows in the whole series.

1255938,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B0028RABR0,Kasey G,"[4, 4]","When ""Charlie's Angels"" returned for its fourth season in September 1979, fans were eager to see if the new Angel replacing Kate Jackson could inject some new life into the aging series. Though Cheryl Ladd had sustained the show after Farrah's sudden departure, the stories in the third season had started to become very repetitive and the writing rather weak. These factors may have even been part of the reason for Kate's departure.Nevertheless, Season Four set a somewhat different tone for the show right from the premiere episode, ""Love Boat Angels"". Viewers had come to expect exotic locales and exciting action sequences in the season premieres. While the former certainly applied here, the latter unfortunately was lacking. We had a lame scuffle aboard the Pacific Princess that involved Cheryl Ladd pulling a gun on the thugs beating on Bo Hopkins and Bert Convy; later, a dull car chase and two routine kidnappings. Even the big set piece, the underwater scuba chase is not very exciting. New Angel Shelley Hack does not make much of a splash, foreshadowing the minimal role she will have for about the next seven episodes) aside from firing shots from a speedboat during the climax.Shelley Hack's modeling background had Aaron Spelling proudly proclaiming ""We're bringing back the glamour"". The clothing budget for this season was astronomical, with Nolan Miller working his magic on the three actresses. It should be noted that the wardrobes for Smith, Ladd and Hack became very sophisticated this year, with lots of designer skirts, blouses and suits replacing the more casual togs of the Kate Jackson era. The problem was that classing up the act made Kelly, Kris and Tiffany blend together like some Supermodel Task Force. The much-needed contrast of a more earthy/edgy Angel was missing and hurt the chemistry. (Tanya Roberts' character was initially created to spice up the mix next season).And so lies the problem with Season Four: lack of interaction between Jaclyn, Cheryl and Shelley, unimaginative action/stunts and too many solo Angel stories. Even Farrah's return guest spots are uninspired, save for the first one ""Fallen Angel"", which is perhaps the best episode of the six she filmed after quitting the show as a regular.Yet, ""Charlie's Angels"" proved it could still deliver the goods when the writing hit the mark. ""Angel Hunt"", ""Angels on Campus"" and ""Angels on the Street"" are among the season's best, and some of the most memorable shows filmed, even including the Kate Jackson era. It seems this season had an Old-Hollywood vibe running through it, due to some of the guest stars such as Barbara Stanwyck, Cesar Romero, and Howard Duff. Many of the scripts could have been inspired by old movies: ""Of Ghosts and Angels"" from ""Rebecca""; ""Caged Angel"" from ""Caged""; ""Angel Hunt"" from ""The Most Dangerous Game"". Even the season-finale ""One Love...Two Angels"" plays more like an old Lana Turner ""women's picture"" than your typical episode of ""Angels"".Shelley Hack was used as a scapegoat for the show's sagging ratings, when in truth, they probably would have dipped even lower had the interest generated by a new Angel not had viewers still tuning in. While her performances are somewhat stiff at times, Hack was in no way the kiss of death for this series, and could have easily made the transition to Season Five had the producers not axed her.As far as the product itself, the episodes on this set look better than I've ever seen them on TV. They are all unedited, save for the season premiere, which is edited into two episodes from its original two-hour running time. The cover art is fantastic, the best so far for this series. Sony was wise to enlist the aid of fans to get the box art just right. Some of their other work on sets like ""Bewitched"" was just atrocious. Unfortunately, aside from the first release, ""Charlie's Angels"" has been treated poorly in the way of bonus features. A show with such a high pop-culture profile should have at least some cast commentaries over select episodes. Regardless, I was shocked when Sony announced this title, as I thought they had long-abandoned it. Now if we could only get them to finally give us the final season, or license it to Shout! Factory.I recommend this set if you already own the previous three. You may be pleasantly surprised that the dirt thrown on this season back in 1979-80 was very unwarranted and it rightfully belongs in the collection of any Angels fan. Is it Award-winning Emmy-worthy TV? Not at all. But it IS definitely an entertaining time capsule of the end of the disco era when satin hot pants, feathered hairdos and big luxury cars ruled.",4,Aaron Spelling is Bringing Back the

In my opinion the show doesn't flow as smoothly as it did with Kate. Cheryl Ladd's character seems to almost be reading her lines, they are spoken short, quick and staccato-like. Shelley Hack's character seems hesitant all the time, hesitant to speak, hesitant in what she says and in how she says it. Jaclyn's Smith's character is the only one that seems to flow, but it's awkward for her to flow when the other 2 are going off in their own direction.

1255943,A2UUYORVIZ00UH,B0028RABR0,Noirdame,"[4, 5]","I'm not really old enough to have seen ""Charlie's Angels"" during its original run, so perhaps that was why I wasn't so dismayed by Kate Jackson's departure. I thought I would miss Sabrina but I didn't. Not that Jackson didn't bring anything to the show - she was a huge part of it, but I like Shelley Hack (having seen her in ""The Stepfather""), and I don't blame her for the demise of the show, like some do.  I do think in a way Season 4 is an improvement over Season 3 in that the writing for the most part was better.  Not that there weren't some misfires, but overall I think this season came off better.  The mistake was made in the order that they aired - so that Hack's character Tiffany Welles had very little to do and little character development until the end of the season, but by that times the show's ratings had decreased rapidly.  On top of that, I think the public was losing interest and some episodes started to feel repetitive, beginning in the previous season. Unfortunately, the powers-that-be gave Hack her walking papers and went looking for a new Angel for what turned out to be the show's final season.Tiffany Welles hailed from Boston and like Kelly Garrett (Jaclyn Smith) and Kris Monroe (Cheryl Ladd) was a former police officer.  The ladies sport a more feminine wardrobe than the previous season - which may have had to do with Jackson's leaving the show but may have also hinted at the dawn of the new 80s decade. When she was onscreen long enough to make an impression, Hack's Tiffany established a nice chemistry with her fellow Angels and the lovable Bosley (David Doyle).  Once again, a wonderful array of guest stars make appearances - Farrah Fawcett, fufilling her last contractual guest spots, along with Tab Hunter, Joanna Pettit, Barbara Stanwyck, Patrick Duffy, Robert Reed, Beverly Garland, Caesar Romero, Ed Begley Jr., Robin Mattison, Kim Cattral, Sally Kirkland, Bo Hopkins, Bert Convy, Gary Collins, Dick Sargent, and my personal favorite - Timothy Dalton, who works alongside Farrah in ""Fallen Angel"".""Fallen Angel"" is a favorite of mine, but as I have a thing for Timothy Dalton, it's no shocker. I also loved especially ""Caged Angel"", ""Angels On The Street"", ""Catch A Falling Angel"", ""Nips And Tucks"", ""Toni's Boys"", ""An Angel's Trail"", ""Angels On Campus"", ""Of Ghost And Angels"", and ""One Of Our Angels Is Missing"".  The only episode I didn't particularly care for was ""The Prince And The Angel"" - probably the weakest of Farrah's guest appearances.  For some reason I found it very bland and uninteresting.  I will say that this season has less duds than the previous one.  Ladd does a great job in ""Caged Angel"" - some might call it a rehashing of Season 1's ""Angels In Chains"", but I found her work to be some of the best she did on the series - and she always gave good performances.  And I loved Kelly and Tiffany's disguises as nuns!  ""Of Ghosts And Angels"" I find very watchable and very haunting - if there was ever an episode I want to be a TV movie, that one would be it.  I don't know why, but I kind of associated ""Angels On Campus"" with the film ""The Deliberate Stranger"" - I guess since the setting and premise is similar.Season 4 was released sooner than I thought it would be, but perhaps that was intentional since it happened around the time of Farrah's passing in June 2009.  It was a nice tribute to the Angel who first caught the public's imagination. I'm hoping that Season 5 will soon see the light of day.Watch Season 4 with an open mind.

Shelly Hack gave new energy to the show. There were several things, which hurt Season 4: No. 1, the decesion to have more solo stories of the angels. In the beginning, we saw Kelly stuggle with a heroin addict, Kris goe to jail, but didn't see the group as a team. The solo episodes with Tiffany are some of the best, the episodes of Tiffany at college, as a prositute, in a haunted house are some of the best. Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd at this time do not act as well as they did in the previous seasons. It is almost like they are ready for the show to end, so they can start their own solo successful careers. Also, the first episodes minimized Shelly's role. She didn't even get her star spolight in her first episode. As Cheryl Ladd stated, ""Shelly, took a lot of crap."" She really did. Shelly's acting is just as good as the rest of the crew. It was a shame that Shelly was written out of the show. Tanya Roberts couldn't save the show either. As a result, this was another cruel Hollywood story where someone else was blamed for the down ratings. Enjoy the dvd and remember Shelly Hack.

1255947,AAP2RANG3TTSM,B0028RABR0,"Rodney Bogardus ""piscean dream""","[59, 60]","The fourth season of CHARLIE'S ANGELS, which aired on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on ABC from September 1979 through May 1980, is possibly the season that yields the most dramatic changes in the series, namely Shelley Hack becomes the newest angel, ""Tiffany Welles"", filling the slot vacated by original actress Kate Jackson. Returning for another tour of duty this season are ""Kelly Garret"" and ""Kris Munroe"", played by Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd respectively, along with faithful sidekick ""Bosley"", played by David Doyle. Farrah Fawcett's ""Jill Munroe"" also makes her final three appearances of the series.With the new angel, also comes a new overall look to the series. With Hack, a former fashion model, on board, all three actresses don dresses, gowns, and tailored suits more often than casual wear. And while attention is taken away from the flesh (the Angels wear fewer bathing suits this season than ever before), the Angels never looked classier and more stunning in their wardrobe. The result is mature, professional-looking Angels that seem to have come a long way from the earlier days of the show when they rarely wore bras.Aside from a new angel and a new look, the significant change that takes place this season that differentiates it from its predecessors is the writing style. Unlike the writing from season three which, at times, is dull and underwhelming, season four's writing includes several intriguing storylines that are largely the contribution of guest writers. ANGELS ON CAMPUS, ANGEL HUNT, FALLEN ANGEL, and THREE FOR THE MONEY are guest writer-contributed scripts and consequently, they are among the season's highlights as they are solid episodes that demonstrate the series' potency and vitality, even in its fourth season. The writing style also differs with certain episodes straying from the usual team formula, instead showcasing a single Angel while the other two Angels and Bosley are relegated to the background. A final aspect of the writing that changes is the overall tone, with some episodes (AVENGING ANGEL, CATCH A FALLING ANGEL, ANGEL'S CHILD, ANGELS ON THE STREET) tackling social issues such as drug abuse, pornography, child abuse, and prostitution with greater urgency than had been seen before in the series.However, an aspect of the writing this season that backfired is intentionally minimizing the role of new angel ""Tiffany"" in the first several episodes. Two episodes in particular, ANGELS ON CAMPUS and ANGEL HUNT, are pivotal because the former establishes the back story and character of ""Tiffany"" and the latter validates the newest angel's position in the group and fleshes out all three angels' profound concern for each other. It's safe to assume these two episodes were among the first ones filmed because clips from them appear in the opening credits, yet unfortunately they did not air until almost halfway through the season. This was a poor decision on behalf of the producers/creators that damaged the series because it prevented the new angel (and actress) from instantly impressing and clicking with audiences. For this reason, Hack often, and rather unfairly, earns the odium from some fans as the death knell to the series. To remedy this, a simple rearranging of the initial episodes of the season would suffice: LOVE BOAT ANGELS, ANGELS GO TRUCKIN', ANGELS ON CAMPUS, ANGEL HUNT, FALLEN ANGEL, followed by OF GHOSTS AND ANGELS. Had these episodes aired in a similar sequence, perhaps the course of the series would have been quite different, with ""Tiffany"" continuing to work for Charles Townsend and Associates into the fifth season.The only genuine flaw in the DVD set is the inclusion of the syndicated 2-part version of the season premier, LOVE BOAT ANGELS, instead of the original unedited print. The set is presented in a similar format to that of the third season set, with an outer box that houses 3 slim plastic DVD cases. Each case holds 2 discs and features a different group photo of the Angels on the cover, with episode titles, synopses, and original air dates on the back, and several photos of the Angels, Bosley, and the season's numerous guest stars (Patrick Duffy, Kim Cattrall, Timothy Dalton, Robert Reed, Barbara Stanwyck, etc.) throughout. Aesthetically, this is easily the best presentation of all CHARLIE'S ANGELS season sets.

Not as great a season as previous ""Charlie's Angels's"" seasons, the fourth year brought the biggest change to the show as Kate Jackson no longer appears in it. After Aaron Spelling refused her time off to film ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" the year before, Kate walked off the show, and her disappearance is evident. The loss of Kate was suicide for the show. The producers replaced her with Shelley Hack, who played Tiffany Wells. Hack was a feature in the television commercials for ""Charlie Perfume"". Most of the audience, including this reviewer, never warmed up to Hack. I always felt her portrayal was cool and unlikable. The producers and the network felt the same way as Hack last this one season, only to be replaced by another actress in season five.25 episodes are included in this boxset, and there are no special features. What makes this year wonderful, however, are the special guest appearances by some of the best Hollywood stars inluding Ceasar Romero, Barbara Stanwyck, Patrick Duffy, Robert Reed, Timothy Dalton, and a pre ""Sex and the City"" Samantha, Kim Cattrell. Farrah Fawcett also makes her final appearance this year in three episodes.Many controversial storylines are covered this year including prostitution, ponorgraphy, and drugs.""Charlie's Angels"" experienced a downward turn in its Nielsen numbers in the fourth year as the series fell to a low of 25, with a rating of 15.9.

1255955,A65XH6L5BUX0X,B0028RABR0,"TheClassicsNut65 ""morgan miller""","[2, 3]","At the end of the third season, we say good-bye to another Angel, Kate Jackson as Sabrina Duncan. At least Sabrina is given a proper good-bye, which was not done for Jill Munroe two years earlier.With the departure of Kate Jackson, producers went searching for a new Angel. Several up-and-coming actresses were considered, including newcomer Michelle Pfeiffer, Connie Sellecca, Shari Belafonte, and Barbara Bach. Pfeiffer was a personal favorite at first, but her audition didn't show much promise, however, and producers eventually hired Charlie perfume model Shelley Hack as Jackson's replacement.Hack debuts as Tiffany Welles, a police graduate from Boston, in the season four premiere, ""Love Boat Angels,"" which was a two-part crossover episode with the fellow ABC series, The Love Boat. Tiffany instantly kicks it off with Kelly and Kris and the new trio of Angels begin their adventures.Season Four has some very interesting episodes: ""Angels Go Truckin',"" ""Angels at the Altar,"" ""Caged Angel,"" ""Angels on the Street,"" and ""Catch a Falling Angel"" among others. This season surely brings more fire from the first two seasons, with unique and mysterious episodes that have secretive plot twists.Season Four also brings Farrah Fawcett back for three more guest appearances, which too are three great episodes from this season: ""Fallen Angel,"" ""The Prince and the Angel,"" and ""An Angel's Trail"".My only complaint from this season is that the producers and writers don't seem to show too much interest in Shelley Hack or her character, Tiffany Welles. In Tiffany, the writers show her as a sophisticated and classy lady. She often has very little to do, however, and seems as if she was fitted into episodes pre-written to her casting. It's no wonder the critics and audience didn't like her back then. She was barely in some episodes.Nonetheless, I don't think the sudden ratings slide during this season was all do to Shelley Hack's entering the series. I think the audience had just grown tired of the show in its entirety, not because of another cast change. The very good episodes from this season were wasted on a shrinking audience, who watched those pitiful episodes from Season Three. I think Cheryl Ladd said it the best: she believed ABC (the show's network) had gotten ""too confident"" that the show would last not matter how many changes. Maybe that was true, maybe not. But don't point the finger at Shelley solely, point at the writers and producers, too.Overall, I don't think this season will disappoint you. As I have said, it has some very good episodes and some very good plot twists. Give it a try, forget what others have said, give it your own opinion.",4,Enter Shelley Hack.,1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,2675,"['end', 'third', 'season', 'say', 'good-bye', 'Angel', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'Sabrina', 'Duncan', 'least', 'Sabrina', 'given', 'proper', 'good-bye', 'was', 'not', 'done', 'Jill', 'Munroe', 'two', 'years', 'earlier.With', 'departure', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'producers', 'went', 'searching', 'new', 'Angel', 'Several', 'up-and-coming', 'actresses', 'were', 'considered', 'including', 'newcomer', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Connie', 'Sellecca', 'Shari', 'Belafonte', 'Barbara', 'Bach', 'Pfeiffer', 'was', 'personal', 'favorite', 'first', 'audition', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'much', 'promise', 'however', 'producers', 'eventually', 'hired', 'Charlie', 'perfume', 'model', 'Shelley', 'Hack', 'Jackson', 'replacement.Hack', 'Tiffany', 'Welles', 'police', 'graduate', 'Boston', 'season', 'four', 'premiere', 'Love', 'Boat', 'Angels', 'was', 'two-part', 'crossover', 'episode', 'fellow', 'ABC', 'series', 'Love', 'Boat', 'Tiffany', 'instantly', 'off', 'Kelly', 'Kris', 'new', 'trio', 'Angels', 'begin', 'adventures.Season', 'Four', 'very', 'interesting', 'episodes', 'Angels', 'Go', 'Truckin', 'Angels', 'Altar', 'Caged', 'Angel', 'Angels', 'Street', 'Catch', 'Falling', 'Angel', 'others', 'season', 'surely', 'more', 'fire', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'unique', 'mysterious', 'episodes', 'have', 'secretive', 'plot', 'twists.Season', 'Four', 'also', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'back', 'three', 'more', 'guest', 'appearances', 'too', 'are', 'three', 'great', 'episodes', 'season', 'Fallen', 'Angel', 'Prince', 'Angel', 'Angel', 'Trail', 'only', 'complaint', 'season', 'producers', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'show', 'too', 'much', 'interest', 'Shelley', 'Hack', 'character', 'Tiffany', 'Welles', 'Tiffany', 'writers', 'show', 'sophisticated', 'classy', 'lady', 'often', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'however', 'was', 'fitted', 'episodes', 'pre-written', 'casting', 'wonder', 'critics', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'back', 'then', 'was', 'barely', 'episodes.Nonetheless', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'sudden', 'ratings', 'slide', 'season', 'was', 'do', 'Shelley', 'Hack', 'entering', 'series', 'think', 'audience', 'had', 'just', 'grown', 'tired', 'show', 'entirety', 'not', 'cast', 'change', 'very', 'good', 'episodes', 'season', 'were', 'wasted', 'shrinking', 'audience', 'who', 'watched', 'pitiful', 'episodes', 'Season', 'Three', 'think', 'Cheryl', 'Ladd', 'said', 'best', 'believed', 'ABC', 'show', 'network', 'had', 'gotten', 'too', 'confident', 'show', 'would', 'last', 'not', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'changes', 'Maybe', 'was', 'true', 'maybe', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'point', 'finger', 'Shelley', 'solely', 'point', 'writers', 'producers', 'too.Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'season', 'will', 'disappoint', 'have', 'said', 'very', 'good', 'episodes', 'very', 'good', 'plot', 'twists', 'Give', 'try', 'forget', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'give', 'own', 'opinion']",Charlie's Angels The Complete Fourth Season

However, it is about time this season comes to DVD.  It's a season that fans have been waiting for.  Hopefully we once again won't have to wait too long to get season five of the series.Shelley Hack made her less than stellar debut as Tiffany Welles, the sophisticated, east-coast Angel.  While she did her best, one can't get over the lack of chemistry between Tiffany and Kelly and Kris.  The chemistry between Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd remains solid however, so it's always a treat to see scenes between the two of them.Season four also marks the final guest appearances of Farrah Fawcett as first season Angel, Jill Munroe.  Other notable guest-stars include iconic actress, Barbara Stanwyck and Kim Cattrall.While not the best season of the series, season four of 'Charlie's Angels' contained some highlights of the series, the debut episode of the show features a cross-over event with Aaron Spelling's other hit 70's series, 'The Love Boat.'

I've always been a big Shelley Hack fan.  Right from Death Car On The Freeway.  Some of my favorite episodes in season 4 are Angels Go Trucking, Of Ghost and Angels, Angel Hunt, Angels On The Sreets, To Catch A Falling Angel, and Angels on Campus.  I don't think it was fair to blame Shelley for the fall in ratings.  I think if they showcased her more and made her the focal story of Love Boat Angels, I think the ratings would have stayed high.  When they started having some episodes focus on one angel the other two were sort of used as set decorationThe DVD's have some great art work for the fourth season.  They have awesome pictures of what the dics and what the cover art is going to be. I just love Sony TV DVD's.  They spend the extra money for art, music, and complete unedited shows.  Sony is the best when it comes to TV shows on DVD.  Let's hope the sales are great for season 4 so season 5 won't take 3 three to come out.  Thanks all.
