But it wasn't, however the movie was excellent.A combination of Quentin Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie. The Dialogues where excellent and sometimes funny. And one of the coolest special effects I've seen ...... The movie also has some funny moments. But I don't think the subtitles are as funny as the spoken language. ....I really enjoyed the movie, and for people that enjoy tarantino (without most of the violence) will enjoy this movie",4,"Excellent Movie, I have the Korean DVD Version",1037145600,"11 13, 2002",2002,547,"['When', 'bought', 'movie', 'DVD', 'Korean', 'version', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'action', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'however', 'movie', 'was', 'excellent.A', 'combination', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'Dialogues', 'where', 'excellent', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'one', 'coolest', 'special', 'effects', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'also', 'funny', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'subtitles', 'are', 'as', 'funny', 'spoken', 'language', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'people', 'enjoy', 'tarantino', 'most', 'violence', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie']",Guns & Talks

I was able to laugh without wondering why or feeling guilty about it... and while confronted with the characters sometimes ambiguous feelings about their jobs at times, it's kind of matted over with a general feeling of good cheer and ""hey, let's not get too serious"".  Stylistically it's not as admirable as other films in the similar genre and spirits like Leon (though it does make a cheeky reference to it).Overall, though it leaves me not wanting to dismiss it as fluff or some ""feel good movie"", I can't help but feel that it is... so I'll call it very enjoyable ""borderline fluff"" comedy.",4,..................................,1092528000,"08 15, 2004",2004,939,"['Very', 'entertaining', 'good-spirited', 'generally', 'lighthearted.It', 'not', 'weighed', 'down', 'overt', 'pursuit', 'thematic', 'ambitions', 'are', 'usually', 'associated', 'assassination', 'movies', 'so', 'punch', 'something', 'else', 'apparent', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'maybe', 'recent', 'Assassination', 'Tango', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'example', 'free', 'was', 'able', 'laugh', 'wondering', 'why', 'feeling', 'guilty', 'confronted', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'ambiguous', 'feelings', 'jobs', 'times', 'kind', 'matted', 'general', 'feeling', 'good', 'cheer', 'hey', 'let', 'not', 'get', 'too', 'serious', 'Stylistically', 'not', 'as', 'admirable', 'other', 'films', 'similar', 'genre', 'spirits', 'Leon', 'make', 'cheeky', 'reference', '.Overall', 'not', 'wanting', 'dismiss', 'fluff', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'so', ""'ll"", 'call', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'borderline', 'fluff', 'comedy']",Guns & Talks

720055,A2A7SO6BBYM13F,B00006L93J,Garvinstomp,"[0, 0]","Guns and Talks really is a fantastic film.  First off, let me explain the main reason that people have a negative reaction to this film.  There are two reasons that people don't like movies.  The first is that the film is really just not very good.  The second is that the film wasn't what was expected or doesn't fall into the respective tastes of the viewer.  Guns and Talks falls into this second category.When I was looking to buy the film and reading official reviews around the net, many reviewers likened the film to Tarantino and Guy Richie.  Unfortunately, the similarities are only in the concept.  4 assassins that are friends and live together struggle with the conflicts of their job and their personal lives and all the shenanigans that ensue.  Sure, I could see QT of GR pitching it.  But that is where the similarities end.You don't get the trademark QT dialogue or the hyper-stylized, ultra cool GR universe.  It's far more low key than that, and also a bit more straightforward.  People have been disappointed because it didn't have ultra-slick camera work and larger-that-life characters like a Woo film.  But this film isn't trying to do any of those things.  Reviewers just like getting their reviews quoted, so by sticking some popular movie titles or director names in their review, it gives the review a better chance of being used.  Ok, enough about that.The movie is very good.  It is funny.  There are some memorably funny moments, despite reading the subtitles or listening to the dub.  The humor does translate well.  There is a lot of subtle humor that you have to be paying attention to catch, it's not just a bunch of sight gags.  They do some interesting things with the voice over, as well as using multiple screen panels to show lapsing of time and potential actions.  Very creative.The story itself is interesting and we see the 4 main characters interact with each other and their jobs, all the while hiding pieces of their personal lives, some mixing business and pleasure, and how their friendships make them stronger.  It's also nice to see how the different personalities affect how they perform their assassin duties.  They all have their own style.There are some great scenes.  The Hamlet scene is truly magnificent.  The music mixed with the imagery and the action is just an absolutely fantastic scene that will stick with you long after the movie is over.  It's not so big as to overshadow the entire movie, but it is a standout.  This is the movie that ""The Big Hit"" could have been if ""The Big Hit"" wasn't so bad.The Koreans have really been on a tear making some great movies.  From ""The Host"" to the Vengeance Trilogy (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Oldboy, Lady Vengeance) and this film, Korean cinema has really stepped up in the new millenium.So if you're looking for an action/comedy that really is funny, has some cool action, is a great story, but never takes itself too seriously, this is one of the best.",4,Fantastic Action/Comedy-if you know what to expect. . .,1216684800,"07 22, 2008",2008,2959,"['Guns', 'Talks', 'really', 'fantastic', 'film', 'First', 'let', 'explain', 'main', 'reason', 'people', 'have', 'negative', 'reaction', 'film', 'are', 'two', 'reasons', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movies', 'first', 'film', 'really', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'second', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'expected', ""n't"", 'fall', 'respective', 'tastes', 'viewer', 'Guns', 'Talks', 'second', 'category.When', 'was', 'looking', 'buy', 'film', 'reading', 'official', 'reviews', 'net', 'many', 'reviewers', 'likened', 'film', 'Tarantino', 'Guy', 'Richie', 'Unfortunately', 'similarities', 'are', 'only', 'concept', '4', 'assassins', 'are', 'friends', 'live', 'together', 'struggle', 'conflicts', 'job', 'personal', 'lives', 'shenanigans', 'ensue', 'Sure', 'could', 'see', 'QT', 'GR', 'pitching', 'where', 'similarities', 'end.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'trademark', 'QT', 'dialogue', 'hyper-stylized', 'ultra', 'cool', 'GR', 'universe', 'far', 'more', 'low', 'key', 'also', 'bit', 'more', 'straightforward', 'People', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'ultra-slick', 'camera', 'work', 'larger-that-life', 'characters', 'Woo', 'film', 'film', ""n't"", 'trying', 'do', 'things', 'Reviewers', 'just', 'getting', 'reviews', 'quoted', 'so', 'sticking', 'popular', 'movie', 'titles', 'director', 'names', 'review', 'review', 'better', 'chance', 'being', 'used', 'Ok', 'enough', 'that.The', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'funny', 'are', 'memorably', 'funny', 'moments', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'listening', 'dub', 'humor', 'translate', 'well', 'lot', 'subtle', 'humor', 'have', 'be', 'paying', 'attention', 'catch', 'not', 'just', 'bunch', 'sight', 'gags', 'do', 'interesting', 'things', 'voice', 'over', 'as', 'well', 'using', 'multiple', 'screen', 'panels', 'show', 'lapsing', 'time', 'potential', 'actions', 'Very', 'creative.The', 'story', 'interesting', 'see', '4', 'main', 'characters', 'interact', 'other', 'jobs', 'while', 'hiding', 'pieces', 'personal', 'lives', 'mixing', 'business', 'pleasure', 'how', 'friendships', 'make', 'stronger', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'how', 'different', 'personalities', 'affect', 'how', 'perform', 'assassin', 'duties', 'have', 'own', 'style.There', 'are', 'great', 'scenes', 'Hamlet', 'scene', 'truly', 'magnificent', 'music', 'mixed', 'imagery', 'action', 'just', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'scene', 'will', 'stick', 'long', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'big', 'overshadow', 'entire', 'movie', 'standout', 'movie', 'Big', 'Hit', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Big', 'Hit', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad.The', 'Koreans', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'tear', 'making', 'great', 'movies', 'Host', 'Vengeance', 'Trilogy', 'Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'Oldboy', 'Lady', 'Vengeance', 'film', 'Korean', 'cinema', 'really', 'stepped', 'up', 'new', 'millenium.So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'action/comedy', 'really', 'funny', 'cool', 'action', 'great', 'story', 'never', 'too', 'seriously', 'one', 'best']",Guns & Talks
