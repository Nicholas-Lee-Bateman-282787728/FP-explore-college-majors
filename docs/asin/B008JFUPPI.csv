Bridges is a lawman from the old west while Reynolds is the newest recruit to try to stop the dead from returning to the land of the living. Of course once dead, they don't look anything alike and since Reynolds has left his fianc&eacute;e behind, he is desperately trying to get a message to her even though he looks like an old Chinese man. The best actor in this fiasco was Kevin Bacon as Reynolds partner who double crosses him and is attempting to open the gateway allowing ALL the recently dead, and not good, guys out of their true destination...up or down.

1562938,A2582KMXLK2P06,B008JFUPPI,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","R.I.P.D is a mediocre action/adventure movie but I suppose if children watch it, it's not that bad.  However the problem there is that children probably shouldn't be watching this movie due to all the sexual references.  While they're usually light-hearted references (thanks to Jeff Bridges in particular with his observant female ankle obsession) the bigger issues with the film lies in other key areas.Whenever it tries to be action, it's hardly ever very exciting and is instead insanely whacky.  Whenever it tries to be sincere and emotional, the silliness that occupies the concept makes the few moments of emotion seem limp and forced so you end up not really caring about these segments either.  The storyline suffers as a result of the movie not really knowing what it wants to be, or rather, it constantly goes off in too many directions but never really feels concrete.  Basically Jeff Bridges being an obnoxious lawman makes this movie watchable.  Otherwise it's just constantly goofy.Anyway, the story.  Ryan Reynolds and Kevin Bacon work together in the police department and end up stealing several gold bars from thugs.  Ryan suggests turning the gold in.  Kevin pretends to go along with it, until the perfect opportunity to kill his partner arises during an indoor shootout with Kevin's character knowing he can get away with it without anyone noticing.  Ryan dies as a result, and after winding up in a mysterious place outside of heaven he makes an agreement with a lady in charge of people's fate and comes back to his home city of Boston.  He soon finds himself teaming with Jeff Bridges character as the two of them work on cases around the city while occasionally stumbling upon Kevin Bacon's character communicating with Ryan's wife (concerning the gold and Kevin making an effort to cover his murder crime).  Yes Kevin Bacon plays the bad guy!  I hardly ever see that in movies he plays in.However here's the catch- people can't SEE Ryan Reynolds the way he looked when he was alive.  Instead people see a hot supermodel.  The same goes for Jeff Bridges character.  This leads to several scenes that are supposed to be hilarious but never made me laugh one bit.The animation is unusual.  It reminds me of Who Framed Roger Rabbit or perhaps Shrek in that real people interact with comic book-style animation in a way that makes the monster-like creatures really look like a part of reality.  Expect to see animated monster creatures walking sideways across the outside of building walls as Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges attempt to shoot them down.  It's... odd.  The interaction between real people and animation was odd in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and it's odd here.  The storyline of fighting crimes in a city is similar to Who Framed Roger Rabbit as well.  You will notice similarities between the two films from time to time.Otherwise this is a tolerable action/adventure film but nothing worth going out of your way for.  I recommend waiting for it to come on TV and not actually purchasing the DVD.  It's not interesting enough.  Most of the children watching this probably won't be able to detect the inappropriate references anyway and will instead focus on the monsters so no worries there.",2,too silly,1403049600,"06 18, 2014",2014,3225,"['R.I.P.D', 'mediocre', 'action/adventure', 'movie', 'suppose', 'children', 'watch', 'not', 'bad', 'However', 'problem', 'children', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'movie', 'due', 'sexual', 'references', ""'re"", 'usually', 'light-hearted', 'references', 'thanks', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'particular', 'observant', 'female', 'ankle', 'obsession', 'bigger', 'issues', 'film', 'other', 'key', 'be', 'action', 'hardly', 'ever', 'very', 'exciting', 'instead', 'insanely', 'whacky', 'Whenever', 'be', 'sincere', 'emotional', 'silliness', 'concept', 'few', 'moments', 'emotion', 'seem', 'limp', 'forced', 'so', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'really', 'caring', 'segments', 'storyline', 'suffers', 'result', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'knowing', 'what', 'be', 'rather', 'constantly', 'off', 'too', 'many', 'directions', 'never', 'really', 'feels', 'concrete', 'Basically', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'being', 'obnoxious', 'lawman', 'movie', 'watchable', 'Otherwise', 'just', 'constantly', 'goofy.Anyway', 'story', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'work', 'together', 'police', 'department', 'end', 'up', 'stealing', 'several', 'gold', 'bars', 'thugs', 'Ryan', 'turning', 'gold', 'Kevin', 'go', 'along', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'kill', 'partner', 'arises', 'indoor', 'shootout', 'Kevin', 'character', 'knowing', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'anyone', 'noticing', 'Ryan', 'result', 'winding', 'up', 'mysterious', 'place', 'heaven', 'agreement', 'lady', 'charge', 'people', 'fate', 'back', 'home', 'city', 'Boston', 'soon', 'teaming', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'character', 'two', 'work', 'cases', 'city', 'occasionally', 'stumbling', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'character', 'communicating', 'Ryan', 'wife', 'concerning', 'gold', 'Kevin', 'making', 'effort', 'cover', 'murder', 'crime', 'Yes', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'bad', 'guy', 'hardly', 'ever', 'see', 'movies', 'in.However', 'here', 'catch-', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'SEE', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'way', 'looked', 'when', 'was', 'alive', 'Instead', 'people', 'see', 'hot', 'supermodel', 'same', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'character', 'several', 'scenes', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'hilarious', 'never', 'made', 'one', 'bit.The', 'animation', 'unusual', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'perhaps', 'Shrek', 'real', 'people', 'interact', 'comic', 'book-style', 'animation', 'way', 'monster-like', 'creatures', 'really', 'look', 'part', 'reality', 'Expect', 'see', 'animated', 'monster', 'creatures', 'walking', 'sideways', 'outside', 'building', 'walls', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'attempt', 'shoot', 'down', 'odd', 'interaction', 'real', 'people', 'animation', 'was', 'odd', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'odd', 'here', 'storyline', 'fighting', 'crimes', 'city', 'similar', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'notice', 'similarities', 'two', 'films', 'time', 'time.Otherwise', 'tolerable', 'action/adventure', 'film', 'nothing', 'worth', 'going', 'way', 'recommend', 'waiting', 'come', 'TV', 'not', 'actually', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'not', 'interesting', 'enough', 'Most', 'children', 'watching', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'detect', 'inappropriate', 'references', 'anyway', 'will', 'instead', 'focus', 'monsters', 'so', 'no', 'worries', 'there']",N/A

I haven't read to comic, so I cant make any comments on the adaptation.  The film definitely tries to reach out to great many fans; Ryan Reynolds, Jeff Bridges, fans of comic/comic adaptations, big screen effects, and speckles of humor and comic absurdity (which out does the effects in my opinion).Jeff Bridges performance is great, something of a recreation of his country persona (see Wild Hearts and True Grit) and is the highlight of the film.  Partially the reason Bridges sticks out is against Reynolds' cold demeanor.  Either a reflection of the characters or the choice of the actors, the Bridges/Reynolds pairing does work.  Ryan Reynolds' ad libs are always hard for me to get past when they aren't incorporated right.  While they stick out at times, his performance is not worth too much criticism, positive or negative, other than provide an apt straight man for Bridges.Now for Bacon.  Kevin Bacon, more and more, seems to appear as a villain, even super villain.  But, while trying to adapt a South Boston accent, he's more akin to a Batman Forever villain.  All though there are a few decent twists with his character (for someone who hasn't read the comic), the pay off as portrayed by Bacon isn't quite a ringer performance.The animation isn't top grade, which angers most comic fans as a sign of not honoring the comic's art.  While the evil beasties (which shall remain nameless) are bit more comic than graphic, when applied to massive a scale it has some qualities that inspire a bit of awe.Like most Hollywood films, it doesn't try to delve too deep into too many issues, instead relying on the star and animation.

I liked it. However, there were very few funny jokes to make it interesting. The scene where Ryan Reynolds found out what he looked like as an undead cop was hilarious. Jeff Bridges delivered a couple of funny scenes too. Ryan could not make the movie funny or exciting.In terms of action, nothing was special. The actions scenes looked more humorous than serious. I accepted that because it was an action comedy. The problem was the action scenes looked comical. All the demons looked like cartoon creatures. They looked fake and funny rather than realistic and scary.The first 60 minutes were boring with three or four short-lived funny jokes and bad action scenes.

1562971,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B008JFUPPI,Chris Kennison,"[16, 33]","""R.I.P.D."" happens to be one of those movies that could have been something great had some fatal decisions not been made. The premise is a decent one.  A recently slain cop joins up with a band of undead police officers to police the undead who didn't want to leave earth, all the while investigating his own death and parting ways with his existence.  The first big problem that came out glaring from the get-go is the sickeningly close resemblance to another movie that also used an acronym as its title; ""Men in Black"" aka ""M.I.B."".  Once Reynolds character, Nick, passes over, you can't help but feel like you've been here before with the strange characters and the weird partner and the white walls, etc. etc. etc.  They copied ""MIB""'s style, look and replaced aliens with ghosts and you'd think they could have at least not used an acronym as well.Then there's Jeff Bridges playing an old west sheriff named Roy.  The movie tries to be as funny and quirky as ""Men in Black"" but only once or twice does the comedy actually work.  I was thinking that maybe some more of the comedy would have worked had we actually been able to understand Bridge's mumbling incoherent words. He sort of did the same thing in 2010's ""True Grit"" and I remembered thinking the same thing then, although this time, it was even worse. If this is his normal voice, which it may be, then his career is in trouble.As ""Men in..."" err, ""R.I.P.D."" plays out, the story is actually a really good one and it's a terrible shame that the creators didn't brainstorm a little longer to try and be more unique, but they didn't. In fact, the finale of the film is absolutely fantastic and the best part of the movie.  In the movies final moments the effects are outstanding and the emotions of the characters are fleshed out, giving ""R.I.P.D."" at least one thing to be positive about. Unfortunately, it took a long and painful time getting there.Bottom line, this movie was poorly handled by director Robert Schwentke. A perfect example of how poorly it was handled is the use of one of the best gimmicks in the film. Nick and Roy don't look the same when they are earthbound. Nick looks like an elderly Asian man and Roy looks like supermodel Marisa Miller. It is a funny gimmick but even this is poorly used. There are many moments where it would have been better to have had Marisa Miller delivering the lines instead of Jeff Bridges. Regardless of how poor of an actress she was or is, we could have understood the words and it would have been funnier having her deliver some of Roy's lines. There's no excuse for wasting such a great gimmick. None.Thanks to only being able to understand half of one characters dialogue, a funny gimmick that was horrendously handled until the final thirty seconds of the film and the obvious comparisons to ""Men in Black"", ""R.I.P.D."" is the hands-down front runner for the 2013 razzie awards. Will and Jaden Smith and their ""After Earth"" are thankful, as well as Robert Deniro from ""Big Wedding"".",1,What did you say Jeff Bridges?

All joking aside, ""R.I.P.D."" is really unfulfilling, especially when you take into consideration that the comic book the film is based on is published by Dark Horse Comics; a comic book publisher that brought us ""Hellboy,"" ""Sin City,"" and ""300."" ""R.I.P.D."" is appallingly bad in nearly every way imaginable.There are actually a few factors to ""R.I.P.D."" that aren't completely horrible. While the camera work is mostly very dizzying and obnoxious, the perspective is somewhat interesting during the opening raid sequence as it makes the viewer feel like they're part of this police team raiding a warehouse. The camera takes shelter behind walls, sticks its neck out to see if the coast is clear, and seems to wait for Nick's cue to proceed with caution. The way death is handled tries so hard to be a visual ecstasy, but fails. Nick wakes up to everything around him exploding, but the world around him is completely still. He walks around this frozen world stuck forever on pause before falling up into the sky; a technique that was done infinitely better in Adam Berg's Carousel Commercial. The first Dead-o transformation is kind of neat, but quickly loses its charm when you realize how cheap its computer animation seems.Everything else the film has to offer is equivalent to a pig rolling around in its own feces before doing a few laps in the gutter and finishing it off with a big helping of slop that was more than likely already digested by other pigs. Ryan Reynolds is his usual smart-mouthed self, but the poor guy always seems so restrained and held back when he's not in an R-rated film. Jeff Bridges is basically Colonel Sanders. He taps into his Rooster Cogburn accent, but his lines are atrocious as he talks about crumple zones and being smoked like a knockwurst. Why is a guy originally from the 1800s so obsessed with porn, anyway? When he's not searching for his hat, Jeff Bridges is spending his time overacting to a degree that would leave Nicolas Cage wondering just what in the hell Bridges was thinking.With jokes that feature Ryan Reynolds mocking charm bracelets and implying that Roy's last name sounds like an STD, Indian food being not only a big reveal for Dead-os but also an excuse to make characters barf and fart, and a cartwheeling fat Elvis that lasts so much longer than he really should, you can't shake the fact that ""R.I.P.D."" features some of the most juvenile humor of any film in 2013. Combine that with the $130 million budget and cheap looking effects and you have a film that's all bloated eye candy and no substance.At one point, Roy reveals that the eye sockets of his original carcass were molested by a coyote's genitals to which Nick replies that he hoped the coyote got to both of them. Coyote molestation to the eyes for 96 minutes straight sounds less painful and like an absolute treat after viewing ""R.I.P.D."" When Jeff Bridges being thrown under a bus is the best thing a film has to offer, that's when you know that that paved cinematic road ahead of you is going to be unreasonably rough.",1,Never leave the house without Indian food,1374278400,"07 20, 2013",2013,3150,"['So', 'bury', 'gold', 'orange', 'tree', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'will', 'show', 'up', 'try', 'sleep', 'wife', 'joking', 'aside', 'R.I.P.D', 'really', 'unfulfilling', 'especially', 'when', 'take', 'consideration', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'published', 'Dark', 'Horse', 'Comics', 'comic', 'book', 'publisher', 'brought', 'Hellboy', 'Sin', 'City', '300', 'R.I.P.D', 'appallingly', 'bad', 'nearly', 'way', 'are', 'actually', 'few', 'factors', 'R.I.P.D', 'are', ""n't"", 'completely', 'horrible', 'camera', 'work', 'mostly', 'very', 'dizzying', 'obnoxious', 'perspective', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'opening', 'raid', 'sequence', 'viewer', 'feel', ""'re"", 'part', 'police', 'team', 'raiding', 'warehouse', 'camera', 'shelter', 'walls', 'neck', 'see', 'coast', 'clear', 'wait', 'Nick', 'cue', 'proceed', 'caution', 'way', 'death', 'handled', 'tries', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'visual', 'ecstasy', 'Nick', 'up', 'everything', 'around', 'exploding', 'world', 'completely', 'still', 'frozen', 'world', 'stuck', 'forever', 'pause', 'falling', 'up', 'sky', 'technique', 'was', 'done', 'infinitely', 'better', 'Adam', 'Berg', 'Carousel', 'Commercial', 'first', 'Dead-o', 'transformation', 'kind', 'neat', 'quickly', 'charm', 'when', 'realize', 'how', 'cheap', 'computer', 'animation', 'seems.Everything', 'else', 'film', 'offer', 'equivalent', 'pig', 'rolling', 'around', 'own', 'feces', 'doing', 'few', 'laps', 'gutter', 'finishing', 'off', 'big', 'helping', 'slop', 'was', 'more', 'likely', 'already', 'digested', 'other', 'pigs', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'usual', 'smart-mouthed', 'self', 'poor', 'guy', 'always', 'so', 'restrained', 'held', 'back', 'when', 'not', 'R-rated', 'film', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'basically', 'Colonel', 'Sanders', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'accent', 'lines', 'are', 'atrocious', 'crumple', 'zones', 'being', 'smoked', 'knockwurst', 'Why', 'guy', 'originally', '1800s', 'so', 'obsessed', 'porn', 'anyway', 'When', 'not', 'searching', 'hat', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'spending', 'time', 'overacting', 'degree', 'would', 'leave', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'wondering', 'just', 'what', 'hell', 'Bridges', 'was', 'thinking.With', 'jokes', 'feature', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'mocking', 'charm', 'bracelets', 'implying', 'Roy', 'last', 'name', 'STD', 'Indian', 'food', 'being', 'not', 'only', 'big', 'reveal', 'Dead-os', 'also', 'excuse', 'make', 'characters', 'barf', 'fart', 'cartwheeling', 'fat', 'Elvis', 'so', 'much', 'longer', 'really', 'should', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'fact', 'R.I.P.D', 'most', 'juvenile', 'humor', 'film', '2013', 'Combine', '130', 'million', 'budget', 'cheap', 'looking', 'effects', 'have', 'film', 'bloated', 'eye', 'candy', 'substance.At', 'one', 'point', 'Roy', 'eye', 'sockets', 'original', 'carcass', 'were', 'molested', 'coyote', 'genitals', 'Nick', 'hoped', 'coyote', 'got', 'Coyote', 'molestation', 'eyes', '96', 'minutes', 'straight', 'sounds', 'less', 'painful', 'absolute', 'treat', 'viewing', 'R.I.P.D', 'When', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'being', 'thrown', 'bus', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'offer', 'when', 'know', 'paved', 'cinematic', 'road', 'ahead', 'going', 'be', 'unreasonably', 'rough']",N/A

R.I.P.D. is major parts ""Men in Black,"" with liberal sprinklings of ""Ghost,"" ""Beetlejuice,"" ""Ghostbusters,"" ""Always,"" ""Blade Runner,"" a short-lived 1998 TV show called ""Brimstone,"" and probably many others.Ryan Reynolds plays a Boston cop who's having second thoughts about his recent decision to keep some gold he and his partner, Kevin Bacon, discovered on a recent drug bust. But before he can do anything about it, he is betrayed and killed. He is intercepted on the way to eternal judgment by an offer to join the ""R.I.P.D."" and reduce his post-mortal punishment through his service. The supernatural police department tracks down and eliminates dead folks, or ""deados,"" who have avoided judgement by secretly hanging out on earth. Reynolds agrees and gets teamed with a feisty 1800's lawman turned afterlife crime fighter played by Jeff Bridges. Thus they embark in adventures that eventually lead back to Reynold's killer and a plot for the dead to take over the world.So Reynold's character gets assigned back to Boston  and he thinks this is the perfect opportunity to reconnect with his wife, but it turns out that live folks see him and his new partner totally different than his previous appearance and devine internvention keeps him from actually telling his wife who he really is. Reynolds appears as an old Chinese man, played by James Hong (who is a much better actor than this outing lets him be), while Bridge's crusty western lawman appears as a hot buxom blonde played by Victoria Secret Model Marisa Lee Bertetta.It bothers me that there's several things never explained - besides why they couldn't come up with a better name than ""deados."" When Reynold's character dies, he seems to have no choice than to head towards judgment. So how did these other folks manage to stick around? There's a particular kind of ethnic food that pursuades deados to reveal their true form, so how does that work, or is that just the writers exposing their prejudice? If these are just dead people, why are some of them monsters with multiple limbs, fingers, or even heads?Bridges' character seems a lot like his Rooster Cogburn from True Grit, except this time he has both eyes and a lot more drawl. He often steals the show with Reynold's rookie playing the straight man.The extras on this disk aren't all that strong, There's some minor deleted or extended scenes, a blooper reel, and a making of featurette which details how the R.I.P.D. concept was first hatched in the late 90's, and was a comic book before becoming a movie.I noticed a number of other reviewers begrudgingly liked this film, but it was a big disappointment at the box office and at my house too.",2,Don't waste your time on this MIB wannabe,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,2864,"['supernatural', 'buddy', 'cop', 'actioner', 'never', 'anywhere', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'before.The', 'problem', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'originality', 'here', 'not', 'much', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'done', 'better', 'R.I.P.D', 'major', 'parts', 'Men', 'Black', 'liberal', 'sprinklings', 'Ghost', 'Beetlejuice', 'Ghostbusters', 'Always', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'short-lived', '1998', 'TV', 'show', 'called', 'Brimstone', 'probably', 'many', 'others.Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Boston', 'cop', 'who', 'having', 'second', 'thoughts', 'recent', 'decision', 'keep', 'gold', 'partner', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'discovered', 'recent', 'drug', 'bust', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'betrayed', 'killed', 'intercepted', 'way', 'eternal', 'judgment', 'offer', 'join', 'R.I.P.D', 'reduce', 'post-mortal', 'punishment', 'service', 'supernatural', 'police', 'department', 'down', 'dead', 'folks', 'deados', 'who', 'have', 'avoided', 'judgement', 'secretly', 'hanging', 'out', 'earth', 'Reynolds', 'teamed', 'feisty', '1800', 'lawman', 'turned', 'afterlife', 'crime', 'fighter', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Thus', 'embark', 'adventures', 'eventually', 'lead', 'back', 'Reynold', 'killer', 'plot', 'dead', 'take', 'over', 'world.So', 'Reynold', 'character', 'assigned', 'back', 'Boston', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'reconnect', 'wife', 'out', 'live', 'folks', 'see', 'new', 'partner', 'totally', 'different', 'previous', 'appearance', 'devine', 'internvention', 'actually', 'telling', 'wife', 'who', 'really', 'Reynolds', 'old', 'Chinese', 'man', 'played', 'James', 'Hong', 'who', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'outing', 'be', 'Bridge', 'crusty', 'western', 'lawman', 'hot', 'buxom', 'blonde', 'played', 'Victoria', 'Secret', 'Model', 'Marisa', 'Lee', 'Bertetta.It', 'bothers', 'several', 'things', 'never', 'explained', 'besides', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'better', 'name', 'deados', 'When', 'Reynold', 'character', 'dies', 'have', 'choice', 'head', 'towards', 'judgment', 'how', 'did', 'other', 'folks', 'manage', 'stick', 'around', 'particular', 'kind', 'ethnic', 'food', 'deados', 'reveal', 'true', 'form', 'how', 'work', 'just', 'writers', 'exposing', 'prejudice', 'are', 'just', 'dead', 'people', 'why', 'are', 'monsters', 'multiple', 'limbs', 'fingers', 'even', 'heads', 'Bridges', 'character', 'lot', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'True', 'Grit', 'time', 'eyes', 'lot', 'more', 'drawl', 'often', 'show', 'Reynold', 'rookie', 'playing', 'straight', 'man.The', 'extras', 'disk', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'strong', 'minor', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'blooper', 'reel', 'making', 'featurette', 'details', 'how', 'R.I.P.D', 'concept', 'was', 'first', 'hatched', 'late', '90', 'was', 'comic', 'book', 'becoming', 'movie.I', 'noticed', 'number', 'other', 'reviewers', 'begrudgingly', 'liked', 'film', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment', 'box', 'office', 'house', 'too']",N/A

In essence, saying never mind what little you just saw and couldn't possibly understand because this story actually begins ""3 or 4 days ago.""  This begs the question, what's wrong with starting a movie where the story begins and forget about having to backtrack to another point in time.  What are you hiding, a bad plot perhaps?This is, at all times, an odd movie.  Not quite supernatural, never really a buddy-cop flick, little to no sci-fi content.........there's just barely enough action to qualify it as some sort of a crime piece.  Where Ryan Reynolds (as Nick Walker) goes from one bad partner (Kevin Bacon) to another one (misplayed by Jeff Bridges) in order to save the balance of the world, or something.  You see, there are these deados who want to take over the world with the Staff of Jericho...............This movie wants to be a lot of things it isn't.  The story needed a few more rewrites.  Someone should have told Jeff Bridges to tone it down and try to enunciate clearly.  Ryan Reynolds took being dead to a level of certainty that makes most method actors look like pikers by comparison.  Only Kevin Bacon and Mary-Louise Parker seemed to be having any fun.

Based on the Dark Horse comic book, this supernatural action/comedy is quite a bit of fun. Is the storyline predictable and recycled from other films of this nature? Of course it is; but you don't stop riding rollercoasters just because one has the same amount of loops another one does at the other end of the amusement park.After meeting his own demise, a crooked Boston cop (Ryan Reynolds) is given a choice in the afterlife. Join the forces of the &#34;Rest in Peace Department&#34; and hunt down Deados or take his chances on Judgment Day. He partners up with a former Wild West lawman (Jeff Bridges) to hunt down criminal souls who refuse to vacate the Earth after death and face their eternal punishment. The two discover a plot to reverse the tunnel to the afterlife, allowing millions of corrupt and angry souls to invade the world.Jeff Bridges pours himself into the role of an old-fashioned Wild West sheriff struggling with the modern excesses of the world. Ryan Reynolds looks like he's having a good time, as well. You can tell Kevin Bacon loves playing a bad guy and he shows it here.The DVD version of &#34;R.I.P.D.&#34; includes a few bonus features. There are deleted and alternate scenes accompanied by a gag reel. A featurette entitled &#34;Transferring 'R.I.P.D.' - The Making of&#34; takes viewers behind the scenes of the film.&#34;R.I.P.D.&#34; is rated PG-13 for violence, sci-fi/fantasy action, some sensuality, and language including sex references. I agree with all of the above warnings. Also, the monsters in the movie are rather cartoonish and not as scary as one might think. There's nothing too over-the-top visually to be found. It's as safe as any of the &#34;Men in Black&#34; movies.As you would imagine, any references to God are removed from &#34;R.I.P.D.&#34; Instead, Jeff Bridges' character refers to the ruling power as &#34;The Universe.&#34; However, there's nothing I would say is religiously offensive as far as content is concerned.Although the CGI shows its limits quite a bit, it's not enough to rob &#34;R.I.P.D.&#34; of the humor, wit, and energy it exudes. If you long for a light-hearted supernatural adventure you can enjoy while veg'ing out on the couch and eating popcorn, this is your movie. It very much wears its influences on its sleeve - a nice mix of &#34;Men in Black&#34; and a tamer &#34;Constantine.&#34; Basically, just replace aliens with dead people who mutate into monsters and you have a good idea of what to expect.",4,Big-Screen Comic Book Adaptation &#8220;R.I.P.D.&#8221; Provides Fun and Humor,1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,2567,"['34', 'R.I.P.D.', '34', 'yet', 'example', 'film', 'killed', 'early', 'bad', 'press', 'Based', 'Dark', 'Horse', 'comic', 'book', 'supernatural', 'action/comedy', 'quite', 'bit', 'fun', 'storyline', 'predictable', 'recycled', 'other', 'films', 'nature', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'riding', 'rollercoasters', 'just', 'one', 'same', 'amount', 'loops', 'one', 'other', 'end', 'amusement', 'park.After', 'meeting', 'own', 'demise', 'crooked', 'Boston', 'cop', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'given', 'choice', 'afterlife', 'Join', 'forces', '34', 'Rest', 'Peace', 'Department', '34', 'hunt', 'down', 'Deados', 'take', 'chances', 'Judgment', 'Day', 'partners', 'up', 'former', 'Wild', 'West', 'lawman', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'hunt', 'down', 'criminal', 'souls', 'who', 'refuse', 'vacate', 'Earth', 'death', 'face', 'eternal', 'punishment', 'two', 'discover', 'plot', 'reverse', 'tunnel', 'afterlife', 'allowing', 'millions', 'corrupt', 'angry', 'souls', 'invade', 'world.Jeff', 'Bridges', 'role', 'old-fashioned', 'Wild', 'West', 'sheriff', 'struggling', 'modern', 'excesses', 'world', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'tell', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'playing', 'bad', 'guy', 'DVD', 'version', '34', 'R.I.P.D.', '34', 'few', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'deleted', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'accompanied', 'gag', 'reel', 'featurette', 'entitled', '34', 'Transferring', 'R.I.P.D', 'Making', '34', 'viewers', 'scenes', 'film.', '34', 'R.I.P.D.', '34', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'violence', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'action', 'sensuality', 'language', 'including', 'sex', 'references', 'agree', 'above', 'warnings', 'Also', 'monsters', 'movie', 'are', 'rather', 'cartoonish', 'not', 'as', 'scary', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'nothing', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'visually', 'be', 'found', 'as', 'safe', '34', 'Men', 'Black', '34', 'movies.As', 'would', 'imagine', 'references', 'God', 'are', 'removed', '34', 'R.I.P.D.', '34', 'Instead', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'character', 'refers', 'ruling', 'power', '34', 'Universe.', '34', 'However', 'nothing', 'would', 'say', 'religiously', 'offensive', 'as', 'far', 'content', 'CGI', 'limits', 'quite', 'bit', 'not', 'enough', 'rob', '34', 'R.I.P.D.', '34', 'humor', 'wit', 'energy', 'long', 'light-hearted', 'supernatural', 'adventure', 'can', 'enjoy', ""veg'ing"", 'out', 'couch', 'eating', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'influences', 'sleeve', 'nice', 'mix', '34', 'Men', 'Black', '34', 'tamer', '34', 'Constantine.', '34', 'Basically', 'just', 'replace', 'aliens', 'dead', 'people', 'who', 'mutate', 'monsters', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'expect']",N/A

1563025,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008JFUPPI,FNDNreview,"[7, 27]","There are several signs that a film is destined to fail.  First and foremost, if the film in question doesn't allow for advanced viewing by critics, it's usually a tell-tale sign that the movie studio knows it's bad and doesn't want negative reviews to damage the opening weekend numbers.  Secondly, a massive budget is difficult to overcome, even for an average film with an A-list actor starring in it.  For instance, Green Lantern and Catwoman - two incredibly popular comic book characters - both managed to crash-and-burn at the box office despite the A-list star-power.  Thirdly, if a film looks like a recently released film, potential moviegoers will often balk at seeing the same thing twice.  This is the recent Olympus Has Fallen vs. White House Down predicament.  Finally, if there is other films debuting on the same weekend, odds are the audience will be split amongst the variety of choices, ultimately leading to lower than usual viewers.  Naturally, every one of these factors is weighing heavily on the sure-to-fail comic book-to-film adaptation, Rest in Peace Department (R.I.P.D.).Directed by Robert Schwentke (RED, The Time Traveler's Wife), R.I.P.D. stars Ryan Reynolds as Boston police officer, Nick Walker.  After a drug bust with his partner, Bobby Hayes (Kevin Bacon), the pair decides to keep a handful of valuable gold pieces.  However, Nick feels guilty about his misdeed and prepares to do the right thing by putting the gold into evidence.  However, before he can do so he is unexpectedly betrayed and murdered.  Now a member of the afterlife, he is given a choice to become an afterlife police officer or face his final judgment (as a dirty cop).  Now teamed with a new partner, Roy Pulsipher (Jeff Bridges), the duo must work through their differences to stop an ancient artifact from being constructed, which would allow the dead to return to Earth.  Mary-Louise Parker, Stephanie Szostak, James Hong, and Marisa Miller also star in supporting roles.From the second the first trailer debuted, R.I.P.D. has received an endless amount of criticism for resembling the storyline and characters featured in Men in Black.  While the premise of R.I.P.D. is sound, it does play off Men in Black far too much for comfort to feel like a fresh idea.  Clearly, the story was inspired by a concept of ""Men in Black meet the Ghostbusters,"" but in the weak (and brief) defense of R.I.P.D., most of the films being released these days resemble some other film that's been previously released.  It's fairly easy to cope with the fact that this film is an utter knock-off (intended or not) as long as it provides for an interesting story, intriguing characters, and a plot that doesn't seem too ""off the wall.""  Sadly, R.I.P.D. fails in each and every one of these categories, leaving a completely disingenuous and unsettling feeling of being ripped off.  Like the previously mentioned comic film failures, Green Lantern (also starring Ryan Reynolds) and Catwoman, plus the easily comparable Jonah Hex, it's easy to imagine the sound of money being flushed down the toilet about a quarter of the way through this film.  It's just that nostalgically predictable.Easily the brightest spot of this film is the acting of Academy Award winner, Jeff Bridges, who once again adopts the ""True Grit"" accent, portraying a western lawman with an overzealous attitude and habit of ignoring the rules.  Like the majority of his roles over the course of his career, he's extremely likeable, full of charisma, and playfully humorous.  He fits into the role of the cranky westerner quite well (much like Tommy Lee Jones in Men in Black), adding the majority of the humor to this film in a sarcastic, and occasionally jumbled manner.  On the other hand, his partner (Ryan Reynolds) doesn't fare so well in the role of the ""sympathetic"" lead, often coming off as bland and stale.  Truth be told, Ryan Reynolds needs to lay off the comic book films for a while and stick to serious roles.  For a guy that came into the business doing comedy roles, Reynolds is hardly ever funny anymore.  Somewhere along the way he lost his flair for comedy, and is much more suited for roles that resemble his characters in Safe House or Buried.  However, many of us are still holding on to the small shred of hope that a Deadpool movie is still in the works (yes, he should get a hall pass to make that film).Overall, R.I.P.D. will leave a mostly negative impression on the few people that do end up watching it - for a wide variety of reasons, starting with a predicable story, weak villainy, and sub-par CGI.  The film does have its moments of action and comedy, but this sub-genre of sci-fi action, mixed with the premise of new partners bonding while killing aliens needs to be given a rest.  Like the first Men in Black film, R.I.P.D. would have easily been a hit if it was released in 1997 - but that was 16 years ago.  The rookie being partnered with the cranky old man ""bromance"" has run its course, and that's never been more evident than after watching this film.  Actually, it was pretty evident after watching Men in Black III, too, but somehow that film still managed to be commercially successful.  In any event, there are better things to do with 90 minutes of your life than to watch this film, and depending on how desperate you are when this film hits home video, it might garner a sympathy rental - but, absolutely nothing more.GRADE: DFNDNreview.com",1,"Reynolds & Bridges star in the action comedy knock-off, 'R.I.P.D.'",1374278400,"07 20, 2013",2013,5451,"['are', 'several', 'signs',

1563054,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B008JFUPPI,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 4]","This, too, shall pass, Ryan Reynolds - but what the hell were you thinking? Somewhere lurking beneath the awful suck that is R.I.P.D. is a rollicking film. But something got lost in translation from Peter M. Lenkov's fun comic book out of Dark Horse to its silver screen adaptation. The faults comprise a wealth of poor choices made, ranging from choppy storytelling to crap CG to too obvious cribbing from Men in Black, Ghostbusters, and the Frighteners. Somewhere, Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith aren't sweating it.Our entry point character is Boston's finest Nick Walker (Reynolds), latest recruit to the Rest in Peace Department, the afterlife police force dedicated to safeguarding the living from them restless undead what have lingered past their mortal coil. Nick, baffled hombre murdered moments ago, is given a choice between final judgment and joining R.I.P.D. for one hundred years. You and I, with skeletons in our closets, most likely would've done what he does next. Comes that law badge manifesting, charring, on his chest - a pretty cool visual. Off he goes to track down the dead who've slipped thru the cracks, whose stay on Earth have rotted their souls.Nick's joined up just when R.I.P.D. needs him most. He's partnered up with Roycephus Pulsipher (Jeff Bridges), an ornery U.S. marshall whose heyday was circa 1800. In the midst of Nick's orientation, they sniff out a conspiracy amongst the undead in Boston, a nasty scheme that, if successful, would make the dead rain down on Earth. There's a 3000-year-old artifact served up as the McGuffin. There's Indian takeout food to give the dead away. There's Bridges' dusting off his Rooster Cogburn accent. There's Steely Dan music getting piped into the R.I.P.D. office (it's never explained why).Remember when Amazon used to pimp its Listmania feature? I hadn't seen that in a while. But right now I've this urge to make a new list, the theme of which is Worst Comic Book Movie. And on that list R.I.P.D. would've just gone toe to toe with Jonah Hex, Catwoman, and Son of the Mask for top honors. And yet, in spite of the film's massive clunkiness, Reynolds does his best to anchor things. Bridges, for his part, is always interesting to watch but he just may have been too clownish here, so over-the-top I didn't much care what happened to him. I did like the playfulness between him and Reynolds and that their investigative methods tend to inch toward the maverick side.The R.I.P.D. trailer presented a hilarious gimmick that right away became THE hook for me. The gimmick proposes that the universe, in its sagacity, prefers to blindfold the living. It projects the R.I.P.D. peacekeepers as something other than themselves to mere mortals. So, back on Earth, Nick Walker appears as this old Chinese guy (James Hong) with a banana (but, really, his gun) and Roycephus resembles a voluptuous blonde bombshell (Marisa Miller). And while the film does occasionally make good use of the gimmick, I think it could've explored it even more, for even bigger laughs. Hell, I wanted extended scenes with Hong and Miller. I feel it's only one of several missed opportunities, just another botched element. The film tries but fails to ape what Men in Black did so well, which is strike a balance between its moments of levity and its dramatic beats. There's nothing much here to invest you emotionally, and this is factoring in Nick's pining for his grieving wife (Stephanie Szostak) and his maddogging of his erstwhile partner in Boston PD. Kevin Bacon and Mary-Louise Parker are wasted. There's this sense that plenty of Parker's material was excised, that we only catch a glimmer of her character's quirkiness. And the Bacon, he's just dull in a dull role in a dull movie. The CG is so obvious and overused it takes you right out of the film (okay, some of the bullet time effects were cool). R.I.P.D.'s referencing the fugitive undead as ""deadoes"" is numbingly lame. The deadoes tend to look more cartoonish than menacing. One doughy deado looks like the Michelin Man and Mike Myer's Fat Bastard had a late night encounter. Also, as someone typing out a review, I resent that there's so many damn periods in the film title. So, yeah, R.I.P.D., neutered and soulless, not only appropriates an hour and a half of your life, it may give you carpal tunnel as well.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Transferring R.I.P.D. - The Making Of

1563056,A25GMONBLGQE1U,B008JFUPPI,"H. Ross ""biblemonkey""","[1, 2]","R.I.P.D. is one of those films I was really pulling for. Like the kid with the limp in gym class, you know he&#8217;s not going to win the race, but you can&#8217;t help but hope he&#8217;ll surprise you. Unfortunately, this movie is more like a racehorse with a broken leg and it should be put out of its misery.The movie begins by introducing us to Boston cop Nick (Ryan Reynolds). Nick is having second thoughts about some gold that he and his partner Hayes (Kevin Bacon) took from a bust. He tells Bacon that he is going to turn his share in, but Bacon can do whatever he wants and Reynolds won&#8217;t rat him out. Anyone who has ever seen a cop movie before knows where this is going.Yep, Reynolds is killed in action. Boy, I wonder who pulled the trigger. He is taken up towards Judgment by a giant inverted cloud/volcano thing and is recruited by the R.I.P.D. The R.I.P.D. or &#8220;Rest In Peace Department&#8221; is an afterlife police force tasked with making sure that the dead make it to their final spiritual destination and do not stay behind on earth to plague the living. Some of the recently dead slip between the cracks because so many people die these days, and &#8220;the system wasn&#8217;t designed for this kind of volume.&#8221; That seems like a major oversight, but never mind. Why do they need detectives if they know everything about everyone? For that matter, who founded the R.I.P.D.? How are they funded? Is it God? The government? I think it&#8217;s Bugs Bunny. Hey, it&#8217;s more explanation than the movie gives you.From here the movie is one long list of clich&eacute;s and bad special effects. The plot is fill-in-the-blanks screenwriting at its worst. Reynolds is the young wise-cracking rookie, and Jeff Bridges is the gruff, old-timey lawman who &#8220;works alone&#8221; and &#8220;doesn&#8217;t play by the rules.&#8221; Bridges&#8217; dialogue consists almost entirely of one liners pulled straight from the Wild West Clich&eacute; Handbook. The humor in the film usually revolves around the fact that, to the rest of the world, Bridges and Reynolds do not look like themselves and are masked by, um&#8230;&#8221;Spiritual Camouflage,&#8221; I guess. To every one else, Bridges looks like a Playboy Playmate, and Reynolds looks like an elderly Chinese man.This sounds funny and could have been, but I am struggling to remember it being funny. There is one moment when it is amusing. A talent agent, seeing Bridges as a sexy blonde, tries to recruit him as eye candy in a music video. Bridges&#8217; feministic tirade is actually pretty funny, but it is dragged down because we see Bridges and not the attractive woman the agent sees. It seems like every time it would have been funnier to see Bridges, they showed the blonde and vice versa. Reynolds&#8217; Chinese disguise is a throw away gag and hardly figures into the film. There is a truly awful scene where Bridges eats with his mouth open and it is offensive on almost every level.The effects in the movie were surprisingly cheap. The C.G. would have been dated in &#8220;The League of Extraordinary Gentleman&#8221; ten years ago, and to see it now is just insulting. They must have blown the entire budget on Kevin Bacon&#8217;s scenes near the end of the movie, because those were the only ones that seemed finished. The rest of the movie looked like test footage, with the exception of Reynolds&#8217; death scene near the beginning where the visuals are actually quite nicely done. Unfortunately, his total lack of response to what would be an astounding moment for any human being makes the whole scene feel like what it was&#8212;an actor staring at a green screen.R.I.P.D. seemed like a fun concept&#8212;an action/comedy amalgamation of &#8220;Men In Black&#8221; and the SyFy series &#8220;G vs E.&#8221; Ironically, if this had been a TV movie it might have been charming in its badness and fun for its attempt at camp. As it is, the fact that I can even compare it to movies made by &#8220;The Asylum&#8221; should be a huge red flag for a big budget movie.

I took my 10 year old son, who loves the MIB movies (yes the plot similarity is definitely there, just not the entertainment aspect) and he asked me about halfway through if we could leave.  He thought I would be upset for spending money on it and hearing him complain.  In actuality, I was thrilled for the opportunity to not waste another hour of my life watching this garbage.  His words, ""That's the worst movie I have ever seen"".  Folks, he's 10.  Until this, he had never seen a bad movie, because young kids RARELY think ANY movie is bad.  But he was right on about this.Wait, I have one positive.  Jeff Bridges character could have been great.  In fact, it should have been great.  But the rest of the movie failed all around him so completely that it reminded me of the old saying ""If a tree falls in the woods and nobody is around, does it make a sound?"".  Jeff Bridges was the tree, and NOBODY was around him.  His parts were so isolated and disassociated from the attempted meaning of the movie it made me shudder.  Don't rent this.

Even the weapons used seem to be similar. The only things missing of course are Wil Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Through most of the movie, I kept comparing the 2 in the roles to Smith and Jones and felt that the movie would have been better with them in the role instead of Reynolds and Bridges. I am not saying the movie was bad but felt it was decidedly average and could have been better. I also felt like the chemistry wasn't really there between Reynolds and Bridges. There are moments that they try to be funny but they seem to fall a bit flat in almost like a been there done that or seen that kind of way. For some reason at least to me, Reynolds brings a movie down as I still a bit irritated at his portrayal of the Green lantern which I feel ruined its chance as a superhero franchise.The movie does try to have a bit of heart though with its almost Ghost like portrayal between Reynolds and his wife but it comes across as more weird than sweet and kind of dampers the heart that it tries to give the movie.All in all, it is an ok movie to watch but really brings nothing we haven't already seen, especially if you are a MIB fan.

Ryan Reynolds is a police officer who is shot by his partner, Kevin Bacon over some gold.  Next, we see Ryan being pulled upwards into the sky and continuing on through a tunnel that opens within the clouds.  As he's spinning around in this tunnel within the clouds, he sees other dead people all around him also being pulled upwards through this tunnel. The tunnel pops him out and into the office of Mary Louise Parker. She gives Ryan a choice of either going to face judgment or joining RIPD Boston. She says the tour is 100 years, after which he'll face judgment but with a good recommendation.  Ryan accepts and is introduced to his partner, Jeff Bridges.  Jeff's character is a law man from the 1800's who was also shot dead by his partner.  The two go after a ""dead-o"" and stumble onto a plot to reverse the tunnel that takes the dead up to judgment.  If the plot is successful, it would cause all the dead people to rain down and pollute the earth.A reviewer said he thought RIPD was too similar to the Men in Black series.  I disagree. In the Men in Black movies, the partners are people who are alive and are enlisted in an organization to capture aliens. In RIPD, the partners are people who are dead and are trying to capture dead people who have escaped judgment. Also, the plot in RIPD is about Ryan and Jeff stopping this tunnel from being reversed.  So I don't think RIPD is similar to Men in Black at all.  The plot is fresh, new and very entertaining.Also, I thought Jeff Bridges was extremely funny.

1563206,A1S2M6SA4OAUNK,B008JFUPPI,Perry,"[8, 14]","INTROSo, the movie starts off with Nick (Played by Ryan Reynolds) and Roy (Played by Jeff Bridges, I believe he's found his calling) chasing a very large CGI Scottish man, that makes Fat Bastard look attractive, and we're told that just 4 days earlier Nick had no idea he would be doing this.Cut to the next scene and Nick is digging in his back yard and we see that he buries what appear to be pieces of Gold and marks the spot by putting an Orange tree on top of it (An Orange tree in Boston? Hmm).  The movie then cuts to a scene where he's waking up and his girlfriend is telling him there's an orange tree and the back yard.  Nick then goes to work as a member of the Boston Police Department where he tells his partner Hayes (Played by Kevin Bacon) that he cannot keep the gold and he's going to turn it into evidence.  Hayes says, I've been feeling the same way and I'm going to do the same.Next up, the two partners (Nick and Hayes) are leading a raid on the biggest Meth House in the city.  One thing leads to another and Nick goes chasing the kingpin of the Meth operation up several flights of stairs where, he runs into Hayes who tips him off that he's the kingpin, tells him he cannot let him turn the gold in, and then proceeds to shoot Nick in the face where by, Nick falls 3 stories to his death.  Upon his ascent to judgement Nick is intercepted by the R.I.P.D or Rest In Peace Department where, he is told that this is his only chance to redeem himself of being a crooked cop and he agrees.  Before you know it, he's being partnered up Roy who coincidentally was also murdered by his own partner.THE STORY AND SCRIPTKeep in mind, we're still within the first 20 minutes of the movie and we've already set the stage for what will be an interesting story that comes off without being predictable even if it doesn't have many plot twists.  The partners and their lines are both colorful enough and yet different enough to keep you entertained.The Script itself, has few holes, plenty of action, some very funny dialogue, and as I said before it is overall very entertaining.THE CHARACTERSNick seems to me to be just another Ryan Reynolds part where more of Ryan comes out than Nick but, over all he doesn't distract from the movie.Roy is a sober version of Rooster Cogburn but, I seriously welcomed this as that role was Jeff Bridges best acting job in my opinion!  I very much like that he brought this presence and atmosphere to this movie.Hayes has a bit of a two faced edge two him and honestly comes off with a little bit of a Tyler Durden leadership presence without the multiple personality disorder.  Not a bad job here by Kevin Bacon but, not up to his acting in X-Men First Class.THE EFFECTSI don't know why but, CGI has been annoying the heck out of me lately and this movie is no different.  I think the problem with CGI is that it is an attempt to bring to life the visions we all had as kids but, it does this through computers that are clearly missing something. So, for me, my imagination just always seemed more real growing up and these effects just aren't living up to the presence that the likes of Lucas Arts, Industrial Light and Magic, and many other effects groups brought to the table.So, were the effects bad?  No but, they weren't realistic either.  Kind of like the way Lou Ferigno's hulk was very realistic and the latest Avengers version of the Hulk looks good but, he's clearly animated and nobody would ever question that.OVERALLI really liked this movie, it was entertaining and fun without being too serious.  Was it like Men in Black?  I thought it was going to be at first but, to me the story wasn't as far fetched and neither were the villains.

1563209,A3V61K0EF38GP4,B008JFUPPI,Philip Scholz,"[0, 0]","I don't outright hate this film (I did give it 3 stars after all.)  But it could have been so, so much more.  My first complaint is that Ryan Reynolds's character is bland at best.  I didn't even hear any real emotion from him when he arrived at RIPD and was told all about the organization, his proposed role in it, and the benefits he could expect from joining up (I mean, the man literally just died...you'd think he'd need a little time to get used to everything.  Sure, there was some emotion at the funeral, but that was forced at best and dealt with with way too quickly.)  While this film employed a lot of the stereotypes of buddy cop films, its premise is interesting and the stereotypes that are employed mostly work...Lord knows I've seen plenty of films that did much worse in this area.  I do think things with our leads' new partnership were rushed in the beginning.  I get that, real or dead, new officers in a department aren't given days of orientation and instead ""learn on the job"", especially if they already have some police experience in their backgrounds...that is what senior partners are meant for.  But our buddy cops went from agreeing to be partners to trying to aclamate to one another to totally dissagreeing with one another to coming to terms and starting to work together on the plot's main case in the space of about fifteen or sixteen minutes...I know the movie's not in real time, but couldn't a little more of its ninety  or so minutes have been devoted to developing this relationship?  A single episode of Law and Order where a new partner was introduced spent more time on things like that.  Some of the jokes just fell flat (""Eternal Affairs"" for example (also did they refer to it as ""internal affairs"" when Jeff Bridges character was first introduced?).)  Also, some things were hastily explained at the last minute as though the script writers just suddenly realized that the plot wouldn't make any sense otherwise (the Saint Christopher medal for example) and some things are mentioned once and then never explained at all (""blood of thyn enemy"" for example.)  And what was with the guys' ""catch phrase, ""Relax, body""...does anyone see that catching on?  Again, this could have been a much better film if everyone had just put in as much effort as Jeff Bridges and Mary-Louise Parker, the only enjoyable and truly memorable parts of this picture.  I'm led to understand that this film was based on a comic series.  Well, we've all seen the hits and misses of comic book adaptations.  If you're a fan and you want this film to complete some kind of collection, go for it.  If you're a fan and you want to preserve what you love about the comics and not watch the film, that's fine too.  Maybe you're not a fan at all...I'll leave the purchasing decision in your hands no matter what.

I did like it though because it has a ton of action and suspense. This movie is also 3-D which makes it even cooler because of all the action scenes.This movie is about a guy named Nick (Ryan Rey6nolds) who has a good wife and works for the police department. He also has a good partner (he thinks) until his partner wants the gold that Nick has so he kills him. Nick then works for the Rest in Peace Department and he is paired with a new partner named Roy (Jeff Bridges) who is a cowboy. Nick and Roy have to save the world from a guy named Hayes (Kevin Bacon) who is going to build something to bring the dead back to life!The main characters in this movie are Nick, Roy, Hayes and Julia. My favorite character is Roy because he is really cool, good at fighting and hilarious! He is so funny and is just a really weird guy. He does some things you wouldn't think he might do and it makes everyone laugh.My favorite part in the movie is when a big fat guy gets shot in the butt with a grappling hook by Roy. He was flinging him all around and trying to kill the bad person that's technically already dead. I just thought it was really funny.I would recommend this movie for ages 10 and up because there is a lot of violence in this movie and it's rated PG-13. It also has some stereotypes that might not be the best message for kids. All in all it was pretty funny as long as you realize that is what it is meant to be - a comedy.

Jeff Bridges is a hoot!  Mary Louise Parker and he work so well together that I wish the movie had actually centered around them.  Not to say that Ryan Reynolds isn't good here but there a reason he hasn't become the big star that many folks thought he would after The Proposal.  He just doesn't bring enough depth to a role.  I liked the humor and the silly plot didn't bother me a bit.  Kevin Bacon's role seems a bit slight but Bacon is a very good actor who's had many underwritten roles and he knows how to overcome them.  I wish James Hong and Marisa Miller's roles had been a bit expanded but the notion behind their roles is a pretty good one.  This isn't a great film but it's a pretty good way to spend an hour and a half.  I hope Bridges and Parker team up again soon in another movie.

Oh,you aren't are you? Deado's!!?? How simple,familiar but juvenile a term is that? It sounds like Deadites from &#34;Evil Dead&#34;,doesn't it? Geesh,were Bruce Campbell in this movie to give it some umphhh! While I was happy to see Bridges,I was not impressed with the chemistry between he and Reynolds.Nothing seemed to click,as between Smith and Jones in Men in Black.Speaking of which,this movie has Men In Black all over it,but it just doesn't have a quarter of the imagination and fun that MIB did.In that film the two main stars,as you recall,were hunting illegal aliens.Here we have the stars hunting illegal deados.As a matter of fact,if you listen closely to Bridges affectation of an 1800s lawman,it sounds VERY much like Rip Torn,Smith and Jones's boss in MIB.The so called&#34;jokes&#34; are nothing but.I laughed not once,but NEVER.Bridges and Reynolds had avatars,which is what mortals on earth see when looking at them;Bridges a sexy lady and Reynolds an old Chinese man.At the end Bridges gets a new identity for Reynolds,a girl scout with braces,wearing an appliance.Hilarious......not! The S/FX,as I said,are old and stale.In fact it is one thing that deters from the movie,big time.The deados are absolutely fakey looking all the way through.All that big budget spent on CGI...a waste.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s w/r of 2:35 :1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include and featurette, deleted scenes and a gag reel.All in all a BIG disappointment.The cast does the best with what tepid script they got,but it is to no avail.The jokes fall as flat as the S/Fx.It is a poor mans Men In Black.Sorry to say,give it a pass amigos!",2,A Men in Black wanna be-VERY

Interesting movie, filled with a very entertaining storyline. The special effects are High-end CGI. This movie is similar to the (Men in Black) movies. All acting, sets, props and wardrobes are very good. This movie is filled with good humor, and is emotional at times. Overall, I classify this movie as just one of those types of movies that fills the void on a boring weekend night.  Great for all the family. It really was better than what I expected.

1563259,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B008JFUPPI,S. Der,"[7, 16]","Okay, I really wasn't expecting much from this movie. I read some reviews before I saw it and I thought really? Could it be that bad? And, I got to say, they were not exactly wrong. The movie has something to it. It has great actors, great acting, great directing, great CGI, but the story. The story just didn't cut it. There is something there, but it needs MORE!!!I felt that the story could had been so much better told. It needed more details to it. The movie felt too rush. One part where I felt they could had expanded the movie was the training of the new rookie cop. The training was pretty much one scene so that was super fast training. They could had made it a few more scenes with jokes too. There was just so much potential there and they wasted it.Another part I felt was lacking was the background story to the old cop or more details about R.I.P.D. We really don't know that much about either. I don't know about you, but they really could had added more depth to the both stories than what they did. I only say this because the audience needs to actually care about those characters and to do that, they must give us details on what who they really are and why they do the things they do. We barely cover the surface of the rookie, old cop, or R.I.P.D. I say it's just not good enough. So, who would care if they died for good? So, why should I watch this movie anyways? It's just not worth seeing, if you don't make me believe in them.Let me give you example on how fast this movie really was. Towards the middle to middle end of the movie, there a HUGE problem with the after life. This is supposed to be the main thing that the bad guys has been working towards achieving throughout the movie and the good guys are still a half a step behind. So, all hell breaks loose and you want to know how fast they solved this problem that was just so crazy, disastrous to solve? It only took them 10 mins to figure it out and save the world. Apparently, it wasn't as crazy to solve as they made it sound out to be.  That's just way too fast with no details on how they got it to work out in their favor anyways. What's more is, the bad guys said, it took forever to set everything in to plan. Like decades of hard work and planning. The bad guys made me believe it took them FOREVER to get to that point, where they can turn the ties of power in their favor. Okay, I believe them.Now do you want to know what the good guys did to fix everything? Well, it didn't take much at all. It took the good guys to solve the problem within 10 mins and they didn't explain how that would even work. What a waste of story time. They just can't expect me to take this seriously, when they solved the crisis within 10 mins. They really didn't need to do that much to solve it. It was like any untrained man off the street could had done the same thing, he had no idea of what he needed to do or what was going on. But, he just goes there and just does it. Man, what the heck was that!So, they didn't do anything more with the story and it failed. Also, the jokes were not as good either. Most of the time, it seemed forced and didn't even get me to smile. They also, had a really low acting skills. Finally, the ending didn't mean anything to me as I didn't care for the characters.I don't feel like this movie is worth buying or watching for that matter.

No mention is made of where the two get the fragments, except that it comes from an arrest and should be in the evidence locker instead of in their possession. The story's a little reminiscent of the TV series Reaper in theory but the determination of Nick to bring his murderous partner to justice as well as see his grieving wife one more time offset that.I thought it was a good movie. Jeff Bridges is great as a Wild Bill Hickok look-alike named Rucifus (&#34;Call me Roy&#34;) who becomes Nick's reluctant partner.

But the film suddenly loses momentum there. Capturing (or hunting down) CG-created ""Deados ""is not interesting enough. The main plot needs something more than Kevin Bacon's antagonist and the secrets of ""gold."" The ""Ghost""-like subplot about Nick's wife Julia (Stephanie Szostak) is weak.Actors all did great jobs. Bridges and Reynolds are just terrific. Watching deadpan Mary-Louise Parker is really fun. It is just that director Robert Schwentke (""Flightplan"" ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" ""Red"") doesn't seem to know where the story should be going.The movie is good. Just good.

As it turned out, even that very talented actor could not rescue this turkey from it&#8217;s own self destruction.  It wandered somewhere between Men in Black and Ghostbusters but failed to come even close to those far funnier and more entertaining films.  I have given it a two star rating, but only because of Jeff Bridges who tries mightily to pull this thing out of the muck.  It tries so hard to be funny and fails miserably at it except perhaps, for the very final minute.  Actually, I think I might have chuckled (lightly) twice in the whole movie.  I was not really particularly impressed with all of too cartoonish-like CG characters  running around, either.  This movie was as dead as it&#8217;s characters.
