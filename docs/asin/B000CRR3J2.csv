961743,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000CRR3J2,Z Hayes,"[13, 13]","""Image Before My Eyes"" is a searing and vivid account of Jewish life in Eastern Europe, primarily Poland, from the beginning of the 20th century to the Holocaust. The documentary is made up of archival film footage, still photographs, and live interviews with Jewish survivors of the Holocaust. Their testimony lends an authentic and compelling voice to the narration of lives led by the Jews in Poland before the horrors of the Holocaust.In 1939, there were 3.5 million Jews in Poland and at the end of WW II, only 250,000 survived. A rich cultural tradition, 900 years long, was practically decimated by the Nazis and their collaborators. In Part One ""The Setting"", viewers are provided a glimpse of Poland before WW I. Farming was the main economic activity, especially amongst the Gentiles. There were not many Jews in the farming villages, and most Jews resided in towns or shtetls. Video reels of the period (the quality may not be very clear, but the fact that these evidence of vibrant Jewish life actually survived the war is a marvel in itself) portray life in the shtetls - the sense of camaraderie and community is strong. One survivor, Chiena Kossowksy recalls life in one such shtetl, her voice lending credence to what was and is now gone forever. Photographs of monumental wooden synagogues which were a hallmark of Jewish life in the shtetls show viewers the magnitude of the loss, as they were destroyed by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Holocaust. Also interesting is the contrast between the shtetl Jews and the city Jews. One survivor, Roman Eisner, recalls the ambivalence he felt as a Jew - though proud to be a Jew, Roman expressed a dislike for dressing differently, feeling that there was no need for a Jew to openly identify himself as one through outward appearance, a view not shared by the orthodox Jews. Eisner also paints a vivid picture of the poor Jews who literally carried the tools of their trade on their backs.Part Two ""To The Stars"" focuses on the First World War and the effect it had on the Jews and community at large. Many able-bodied Jewish men fought in the war on different sides - Russian, Austrian, German, even Polish. Many returned from the war to impoverished circumstances, and the families that lost husbands and fathers were in the worst shape economically. Yet amidst these trials, certain aspects of Jewish life thrived, such as the Yiddish theater.Part Three ""Among the Organized"" looks at organized Jewish recreational activities such as the marching band, symphony orchestra, the Jewish film industry, etc. It also, perhaps more importantly, focuses on the growing political consciousness amongst Jewish youth, who joined various organizations and identified themselves as either Torah socialists, Zionist socialists, Bundists, etc.Part Four ""Darkening Clouds"" sees the rise of Fascist regimes in parts of Europe, the herald of darker things to come for the Jews who gradually saw their lives restricted and suppressed through various laws and acts of anti-Semitism.The most compelling part of this documentary for me was the real-life interviews with survivors - this documentary was released in 1981 and to hear these survivors talk about a life that existed before the horrors of the Holocaust, a life spent in the company of loved ones, of friends rejoicing in the experiences of youth lends this documentary a compelling 'voice', one that has become increasingly rare as the number of survivors dwindle with the passage of time. To me this makes documentaries like ""Image Before My Eyes"" invaluable and a must-have resource for Holocaust education.",5,Vivid portrayal of Jewish life in Eastern Europe before the Holocaust,1268784000,"03 17, 2010",2010,3627,"['Image', 'My', 'Eyes', 'searing', 'vivid', 'account', 'Jewish', 'life', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'primarily', 'Poland', 'beginning', '20th', 'century', 'Holocaust', 'documentary', 'made', 'archival', 'film', 'footage', 'still', 'photographs', 'live', 'interviews', 'Jewish', 'survivors', 'Holocaust', 'testimony', 'authentic', 'compelling', 'voice', 'narration', 'lives', 'led', 'Jews', 'Poland', 'horrors', 'Holocaust.In', '1939', 'were', '3.5', 'million', 'Jews', 'Poland', 'end', 'WW', 'II', 'only', '250,000', 'survived', 'A', 'rich', 'cultural', 'tradition', '900', 'years', 'long', 'was', 'practically', 'decimated', 'Nazis', 'collaborators', 'Part', 'One', 'Setting', 'viewers', 'are', 'provided', 'glimpse', 'Poland', 'WW', 'Farming', 'was', 'main', 'economic', 'activity', 'especially', 'Gentiles', 'were', 'not', 'many', 'Jews', 'farming', 'villages', 'most', 'Jews', 'resided', 'towns', 'shtetls', 'Video', 'reels', 'period', 'quality', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'clear', 'fact', 'evidence', 'vibrant', 'Jewish', 'life', 'actually', 'survived', 'war', 'marvel', 'portray', 'life', 'shtetls', 'sense', 'camaraderie', 'community', 'strong', 'One', 'survivor', 'Chiena', 'Kossowksy', 'life', 'one', 'such', 'shtetl', 'voice', 'lending', 'credence', 'what', 'was', 'now', 'gone', 'forever', 'Photographs', 'monumental', 'wooden', 'synagogues', 'were', 'hallmark', 'Jewish', 'life', 'shtetls', 'show', 'magnitude', 'loss', 'were', 'destroyed', 'Nazis', 'collaborators', 'Holocaust', 'Also', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'shtetl', 'Jews', 'city', 'Jews', 'One', 'survivor', 'Roman', 'Eisner', 'ambivalence', 'felt', 'Jew', 'proud', 'be', 'Jew', 'Roman', 'expressed', 'dislike', 'dressing', 'differently', 'feeling', 'was', 'need', 'Jew', 'openly', 'identify', 'one', 'outward', 'appearance', 'view', 'not', 'shared', 'orthodox', 'Jews', 'Eisner', 'also', 'vivid', 'picture', 'poor', 'Jews', 'who', 'literally', 'carried', 'tools', 'trade', 'backs.Part', 'Two', 'Stars', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'effect', 'had', 'Jews', 'community', 'large', 'Many', 'able-bodied', 'Jewish', 'men', 'fought', 'war', 'different', 'sides', 'Russian', 'Austrian', 'German', 'even', 'Polish', 'Many', 'returned', 'war', 'impoverished', 'circumstances', 'families', 'lost', 'husbands', 'fathers', 'were', 'worst', 'shape', 'economically', 'amidst', 'trials', 'certain', 'aspects', 'Jewish', 'life', 'thrived', 'such', 'Yiddish', 'theater.Part', 'Three', 'Organized', 'organized', 'Jewish', 'recreational', 'activities', 'such', 'marching', 'band', 'symphony', 'orchestra', 'Jewish', 'film', 'industry', 'etc', 'also', 'perhaps', 'more', 'importantly', 'growing', 'political', 'consciousness', 'Jewish', 'youth', 'who', 'joined', 'various', 'organizations', 'identified', 'Torah', 'socialists', 'Zionist', 'Bundists', 'etc.Part', 'Four', 'Darkening', 'Clouds', 'rise', 'Fascist', 'regimes', 'parts', 'Europe', 'herald', 'darker', 'things', 'come', 'Jews', 'who', 'gradually', 'saw', 'lives', 'restricted', 'suppressed', 'various', 'laws', 'acts', 'anti-Semitism.The', 'most', 'compelling', 'part', 'documentary', 'was', 'real-life', 'interviews', 'survivors', 'documentary', 'was', 'released', '1981', 'hear', 'survivors', 'talk', 'life', 'existed', 'horrors', 'Holocaust', 'life', 'spent', 'company', 'loved', 'ones', 'friends', 'rejoicing', 'experiences', 'youth', 'documentary', 'compelling', ""'voice"", 'one', 'become', 'increasingly', 'rare', 'number', 'survivors', 'dwindle', 'passage', 'time', 'documentaries', 'Image', 'My', 'Eyes', 'invaluable', 'must-have', 'resource', 'Holocaust', 'education']",Image Before My Eyes - A History of Jewish Life in Poland Before the Holocaust
