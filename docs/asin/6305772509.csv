If they had edited this as a half-hour episode, it would have been perfect, but it suffers from too much padding.  It's still a good story though.  The other two stories are great ones too, though &quot;Elegy&quot; is just a little predictable.

Those were episodes that we typically enjoyed and wished more of.  However, be careful what you wish for. You may just get it. That's what makes this Volume so good. A SHORT DRINK FROM A CERTAIN FOUNTAIN written by Rod Serling concerns a man who wants to become young again. It features Patrick O'Neal and Ruta Lee and I will say no more! In ELEGY written by Charles Beaumont three astronauts land on a world similar to their own, however everyone is in a trance or are they? THE THIRTY-FATHOM GRAVE written by Rod Serling is an hour episode from the 4th Season. It is a spooky tale, yet told in a matter-of-fact style, about the crew of a Navy destroyer that hears strange tapping noises coming from a submarine that sank 20 years before. Mike Kellin as the haunted chief is excellent giving one of the best performances from the entire series in this underrated episode. This episode also features Simon Oakland, David Shiener, Bill Bixby, John Considine and Conlan Carter (Doc on ""Combat""). One of the better DVDs.

477240,A366S12KCZ280V,6305772509,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[0, 0]","Volume 20 of the &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; DVD series is at best an ok disc. It only contains three episodes from the show instead of four but one of those episodes is an hour long from the series fourth season when all the episodes were an hour in length. Nothing bad here in the stories just not some of the better ones from the show.The first one on the disc is &#34;Elegy&#34;. This is actually a pretty good episode, certainly the best of the stories presented here. Three astronauts land on an asteroid. To their amazement there are people on it. Also to their amazement the people are frozen stiff in various poses doing different things. Everywhere they go they see the same thing. Finally they meet a living person who turns out to be the caretaker, played perfectly by Cecil Kellaway,  of the place. He explains what and why everyone is frozen in place. Then when the Astronauts go to... well better not say anything more and ruin the ending.Second on the DVD is  &#34;The Thirty-Fathom Grave&#34;.  A U.S. submarine that was sunk to the bottom of the ocean 20 years ago by the Japanese during WW II is making a banging sound. No one could possibly be alive in the ship down there for 20 years. There is one man however on the naval ship investigating both the sub and its mysterious noise who knows the story of what happened. I agree which other reviews I have read on the particular episode this would have been much better if it had been only a half hour in length. It had a good idea and story that fit right in with the mood of the Twilight Zone but because this was filmed during the fourth season when the episodes were an hour in length the story drags to fill out the time.Last story on the disc is &#34;A Short Drink from a Certain Fountain&#34;. An older man, played by Patrick O'Neal, is married to a much younger woman, played by Ruta Lee. He loves his wife but because of the age difference can not keep up with the social life and parties she is always wanting to go to. Desperate to do anything he turns to his brother who is a scientist who has been working on a youth serum. The big problem with this episode is it is way to predicable. No need to go further what happens you may have already guessed. Both Patrick O'Neal and Ruta Lee give great performances but it doesn't help the story which is just too obvious.While I loved the &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; and these episodes are ok I would only recommend this volume to the most die hard fans of the series like me. For the more casual fan or someone who  has never seen the show before there are other, better volumes out there that can really highlight just how great TZ could really be.",3,OK TZ Volume,1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,2667,"['Volume', '20', '34', 'Twilight', 'Zone', '34', 'DVD', 'series', 'best', 'ok', 'disc', 'only', 'three', 'episodes', 'show', 'instead', 'four', 'one', 'episodes', 'hour', 'long', 'series', 'fourth', 'season', 'when', 'episodes', 'were', 'hour', 'length', 'Nothing', 'bad', 'here', 'stories', 'just', 'not', 'better', 'ones', 'show.The', 'first', 'one', 'disc', '34', 'Elegy', '34', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'episode', 'certainly', 'best', 'stories', 'presented', 'here', 'Three', 'astronauts', 'land', 'asteroid', 'amazement', 'are', 'people', 'Also', 'amazement', 'people', 'are', 'frozen', 'stiff', 'various', 'poses', 'doing', 'different', 'things', 'Everywhere', 'go', 'see', 'same', 'thing', 'Finally', 'meet', 'living', 'person', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'caretaker', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Cecil', 'Kellaway', 'place', 'what', 'why', 'everyone', 'frozen', 'place', 'Then', 'when', 'Astronauts', 'go', 'well', 'not', 'say', 'anything', 'more', 'ruin', 'ending.Second', 'DVD', '34', 'Thirty-Fathom', 'Grave', '34', 'U.S.', 'submarine', 'was', 'sunk', 'bottom', 'ocean', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'Japanese', 'WW', 'II', 'making', 'banging', 'sound', 'one', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'alive', 'ship', 'down', 'there', '20', 'years', 'one', 'man', 'however', 'naval', 'ship', 'investigating', 'sub', 'mysterious', 'noise', 'who', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'agree', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'read', 'particular', 'episode', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'only', 'half', 'hour', 'length', 'had', 'good', 'idea', 'story', 'fit', 'right', 'mood', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'was', 'filmed', 'fourth', 'season', 'when', 'episodes', 'were', 'hour', 'length', 'story', 'fill', 'out', 'time.Last', 'story', 'disc', '34', 'A', 'Short', 'Drink', 'Certain', 'Fountain', '34', 'older', 'man', 'played', 'Patrick', ""O'Neal"", 'married', 'much', 'younger', 'woman', 'played', 'Ruta', 'Lee', 'wife', 'age', 'difference', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'up', 'social', 'life', 'parties', 'always', 'wanting', 'go', 'Desperate', 'do', 'anything', 'brother', 'who', 'scientist', 'who', 'been', 'working', 'youth', 'serum', 'big', 'problem', 'episode', 'way', 'predicable', 'need', 'go', 'further', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'already', 'guessed', 'Patrick', ""O'Neal"", 'Ruta', 'Lee', 'give', 'great', 'performances', ""n't"", 'help', 'story', 'just', 'too', 'obvious.While', 'loved', '34', 'Twilight', 'Zone', '34', 'episodes', 'are', 'ok', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'volume', 'most', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'series', 'more', 'casual', 'fan', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'are', 'other', 'better', 'volumes', 'out', 'there', 'can', 'really', 'highlight', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'TZ', 'could', 'really', 'be']",The Twilight Zone: Vol. 20

Bernabo,"[2, 2]","You will not find a common theme to the three episodes form &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; on Volume 20 of the DVD collection.  &quot;Elegy,&quot; written by Charles Beaumont from his short story, finds three astronauts landing on an asteroid and discovering the place looks just like Earth, with buildings and people, except none of the people move.  It is like being in a giant wax museum.  Then they discover the one animate figure in the place, Jeremy Wickwire (Cecil Kellaway), the &quot;caretaker,&quot; who explains the asteroid is a cemetery where people get to realize their greatest wish after they die.  He then asks the astronauts what their greatest wish might be.  A nice little tale, with Kellaway's performance making it work just fine.  &quot;The Thirty-Fathom Grave,&quot; an hour-long episode written by Rod Serling, a destroyer finds a sunken sub from which clanging sounds are coming.  A diver investigates and hears tapping in response to his signals.  Meanwhile, Chief Bell (Mike Kelin), is having a nervous breakdown and finally tells Captain Beecham (Simon Oakland), that he is the reason that sub was sunk during World War II.  Bell insists he sees the ghosts of his dead crewmates and that they are beckoning him to join them.  Like most episodes from that fourth season, this one would have been twice as good if it were half as long.  &quot;A Short Drink from a Certain Fountain,&quot; written by Serling and based on an idea by Lou Holtz, finds millionaire Harmon Gordon (Patrick O'Neal) using an experimental youth serum invented by his brother (Walter Brooke) so that he can keep up with his gold-digger wife Flora (Ruta Lee).  The serum works and Harmon starts getting younger, and younger, and younger.  Even given the Twilight Zone, there is a nice twist to the end of this one.

477244,A4JHEO7H330AF,6305772509,Tom Brody,"[1, 1]","Volume 20.  Three episodes occur on this disc, one of them being a 1-hour episode.ELEGY.  The story begins with a phony looking rocket landing on an asteroid.  Obviously, the rocket is just a drawing on a piece of glass, moving across a background of painted stars.  Anyway, the interior of the rocket ship is convincing enough, as the control panel has a number of fascinating switches and gizmos.  The ship lands and when the door opens and the ladder flips out, we see a farmyard.  The three astronauts check a monitor that measures the atmosphere's content of oxygen and nitrogen, and they climb down the ladder to explore the asteroid.  They encounter a dog, farmer, fisherman, and townspeople, all frozen.The avid Twilight Zone consumer will also find frozen-person motif in other episodes, as it occurs in A KIND OF STOPWATCH (vol. 15), THE AFTER HOURS (vol. 11), and STILL VALLEY (vol. 18).  In all these episodes, there is no blinking at all, though one can see occasional movement of the frozen people.  Of these, A KIND OF STOPWATCH is the best of these stories.The astronauts encounter a brass band, mayor, and townspeople, all frozen.  They also encounter a beauty pageant, with the contestants all frozen.  One of the astronauts screams, ""What's wrong with you?  What's wrong with everybody in this crazy place? Can't you talk?  Answer me.""  This monologue will be familiar to those familiar with the rock'n'roll group, SKINNY PUPPY.  SKINNY PUPPY has a song called, ""200 Years,"" containing a sample from this same Twilight Zone episode.  While I am not a big SKINNY PUPPY fan, I do like their song called, HARSH STONE WHITE.  The purpose of the scene with the brass band and mayor, is so that the deceased person can enjoy running for mayor (throughout eternity).  The purpose of the beauty pageant scene is so the deceased person (a dumpy fat lady) can enjoy winning first prize in a beauty pageant throughout eternity.An astronaut speculates, ""Maybe we're being made to see and hear what we want to find."" Another astronaut speculates, ""Or it could be that time is suspended here."" Eventually, one of the persons on the asteroid makes himself known.  He is a caretaker of the place, which is actually a cemetery.  THREE STARS.THE THIRTY-FATHOM GRAVE.  This hour long episode goes by quickly.  The story takes place on a navy ship.  The ship encounters a sunken submarine, a WWII submarine that had been resting for 20 years.  When the navy ship approaches and becomes aware of the submarine, one of the men, a reliable veteran of the navy, begins to hallucinate.  As it turns out, the man had been aboard the same submarine when it was sunk and strafed by the Japanese.  The acting and character development are first rate. In particular, what is excellent is the veteran's guilt feelings for escaping from the sunken submarine (all his shipmates having perished), and the captain's excellent response, a response intended to remove the man's guilty feelings. FOUR STARS.A SHORT DRINK FROM A CERTAIN FOUNTAIN.  An aging man finds himself too tired to keep up with the faster life style of his young wife, a girl in her twenties.  She is a hottie who likes to party.  The man's brother, a physician, sympathizes with the man's problems, and reluctantly administers an experimental youth serum.  The story has an excellent surprise ending.My complaints are as follows.  The aging man really does not much appear old.  Although his makeup shows that his skin to be wrinkled, the director should have put bags under his eyes, given him thick glasses, given him arthritis pains, given him a stooped appearance, and should have thinned his hair.  The director should also have done a better job at depicting the wife's fast life style, e.g., by having her receive phone calls from younger men.  THREE STARSIf you want a better disc, I would recommend any one of the following volumes: volume 2 (Time Enough at Last; Nightmare at 20,000 Feet), volume 3 (Kick the Can; Steel), volume 8 (To Serve Man), volume 9 (Nick of Time), volume 32 (Printer's Devil), volume 29 (Penny for Your Thoughts), or volume 39 (Mister Bevis; The Silence).
