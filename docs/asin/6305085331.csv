I am, however, dumbstruck at the number of people who felt they were tricked into buying something which was supposed to be ""The Sound of Music"".  Each of the reviewers who ordered the 'wrong' product states that the picture of Julie Andrews on the cover made them think that they were buying ""The Sound of Music"", when about an eighth of an inch above said image of Julie it states: THE SOUND OF MOVIES.  And sadly, the product ends up getting a 1-star review, when it is their lack of attention to detail (since when is a title a detail...) merits one lone star.  I don't get it.

447957,ANOBZWKE25SBY,6305085331,Tracy Vest,"[1, 1]","The documentary ""The Sound of Movies"" takes viewers back to a time where going to the movies was an event that did not require families to take out a second mortgage for a night out and didn't include cell phones, conversations, and 20 minutes of commercials before getting to the main event. ""Sound of Movies will have viewers humming as they are taken on a journey behind the scenes of such beloved musicals as The Sound of Music, South Pacific, The King and I, Flower Drum Song, Carousel, Oklahoma, and the two musical versions of State Fair written for the stage and screen by the prolific songwriting team of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. Hosted by Shirley Jones (who appeared in Oklahoma and Carousel), the documentary gives an inside view of these great musicals and provides plenty of interesting trivia and anecdotes on most of the films, as well as rarely seen footage and outtakes, potential casting choices left on the cutting room floor, and the inspiration behind some of the timeless stories. On hand to present the segments pertaining to their movies is Rita Moreno (The King and I), Nancy Kwan (Flower Drum Song), and Charmain Carr (The Sound of Music).Finally someone gives snaps to Marni Nixon, the often un-credited voice behind so many Hollywood leading ladies including Audrey Hepburn, Natalie Wood and Deborah Kerr (she even had a cameo as a nun in The Sound of Music).I loved this documentary the first time I saw it on television ten years ago - it renewed my interest in the lost art of the grand musical and opened my eyes to a fantastic movie I'd never seen before - Flower Drum Song. And on DVD, viewers are able to go directly to the movies they want to learn more about.  There are also lots of bonus features including trailers for films, Movietone newsreels, and a variety of screen tests for the movies.",5,Fantastic documentary will have you singing,1245715200,"06 23, 2009",2009,1849,"['documentary', 'Sound', 'Movies', 'viewers', 'back', 'time', 'where', 'going', 'movies', 'was', 'event', 'did', 'not', 'require', 'families', 'take', 'out', 'second', 'mortgage', 'night', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'cell', 'phones', 'conversations', '20', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'getting', 'main', 'event', 'Sound', 'Movies', 'will', 'have', 'viewers', 'humming', 'are', 'taken', 'journey', 'scenes', 'such', 'beloved', 'musicals', 'Sound', 'Music', 'South', 'Pacific', 'King', 'Flower', 'Drum', 'Song', 'Carousel', 'Oklahoma', 'two', 'musical', 'versions', 'State', 'Fair', 'written', 'stage', 'screen', 'prolific', 'songwriting', 'team', 'Richard', 'Rodgers', 'Oscar', 'Hammerstein', 'II', 'Hosted', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'who', 'appeared', 'Oklahoma', 'Carousel', 'documentary', 'inside', 'view', 'great', 'musicals', 'plenty', 'interesting', 'trivia', 'anecdotes', 'most', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'rarely', 'seen', 'footage', 'outtakes', 'potential', 'casting', 'choices', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'inspiration', 'timeless', 'stories', 'hand', 'present', 'segments', 'pertaining', 'movies', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'King', 'Nancy', 'Kwan', 'Flower', 'Drum', 'Song', 'Charmain', 'Carr', 'Sound', 'Music', '.Finally', 'someone', 'snaps', 'Marni', 'Nixon', 'often', 'un-credited', 'voice', 'so', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'leading', 'ladies', 'including', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'even', 'had', 'cameo', 'nun', 'Sound', 'Music', '.I', 'loved', 'documentary', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'television', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'renewed', 'interest', 'lost', 'art', 'grand', 'musical', 'opened', 'eyes', 'fantastic', 'movie', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'Flower', 'Drum', 'Song', 'DVD', 'viewers', 'are', 'able', 'go', 'directly', 'movies', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'about', 'are', 'also', 'lots', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'trailers', 'films', 'Movietone', 'newsreels', 'variety', 'screen', 'tests', 'movies']",Rodgers and Hammerstein - The Sound of Movies
