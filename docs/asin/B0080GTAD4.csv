I see scenes that are clumsily cut and pasted together. For example, in the first fighting scene of the gladiators, the standing guy thrust his weapon downward toward the ground, supposedly into the body of the guy lying there. I can see his weapon was far away from the defeated guy, it did not touch him. Then, it shows the next scene where the winning guy raised his weapon and his other hand to the sky to celebrate his victory. Yuk!

1540577,A2ZKEBPCKEHDGL,B0080GTAD4,C McGhee,"[7, 9]","I watched The Last Days of Pompeii (TV series 1984) yesterday & what a grand spectacle it is. I hope the wardrobe department got something for this one. They deserved it. The intertwining personal lives created for the show are wonderful except for a couple of incidents that are classic CODE creations. The champion gladiator's character is 180 degrees out. The eruption of Mount Vesuvius scene is perhaps the worst part of the movie & it is still very good but the part about a blind woman walking upstream against a mob desperate to escape an erupting volcano is too much to swallow, even though it is to rescue a baby from the arms of a dying woman. That's just too far-fetched too swallow, too much sugar & ridiculous. It is no coincidence that her love interest is the goody-goody gladiator.Those three things aside though this a bona-fide Hollywood epic even though it comes off of TV & it deserves to be called such regardless of source. The cast is stellar portraying politics, competing religious ideas, the life of the privileged & the life of the down-trodden. Crime & selfless sacrifice as well as oppression & over weaning ambition all appear in a clear & understandable story form for over 4 hours in this TV series. Ned Beatty, Brian Blessed (what a great actor he is), Ernest Borgnine, Lesley-Anne Down, Olivia Hussey (Romeo & Juliet), Franco Nero, Linda Purl, Anthony Quayle, Lawrence Olivier & a host of great supporting roles by others make this a great viewing. Perhaps there are few surprises in the storyline once you've been introduced to the characters but it matters not at all. There are few even small false steps.

Previously I watched and reviewed the latest POMPEII film whichI thought was awful.  This was better, though most of the movie was a soapy soap opera of plottings, more plottings, Christians beingmunched by several MGM lions and evil Isis priest mischief.  Again, those nasty Romans, as if it was their fault that the volcano blew.At the end of the film, a grungy looking Christian who was the Bird King from Flash Gordon movie, gave a speech blaming all evilon the Romans and stating the Christians will bring down the Empire.  The Christians did eventually take over the empire, but theydid not get rid of slavery or gladiators; in fact the Chirstian emporers made Nero look sane.  Yes, the Romans had faults as did theGreeks and other ancients, but they did build libraries and public baths and sewers (for ALL the people, not just the rich) createdmodern law, imaginative architecture and a legal system passed down to us.  Being a Romanophile I take umbridge at the constantbashing of Rome by the Hollyweird Left.  Still, this film was better than the new one; a more accurate portrayal of the volcanosequences I think, and better actors.  I wish someone would have freed that poor dog that was tied to a stake.  The sets werereally first rate and the  special effects fine.  I just wish more time was spent on the volcano sequence and less on the silly romanticinterludes.  Still I give this film four stars and rate it a enjoyable.  But I would like to drop Dr. Sweets into the volcano with Daisyand Martha.  yea!!

I never saw it in the 80's.  Despite the presence of Sir Laurence Olivier, Anthony Quayle and Ernest Borgnine (all must have really needed the $$), this mini-series falls into the truly sophomoric, but misses being camp and falls into the ""just plain embarrassing"" category.The script is banal and the acting is full of grimaces, eyebrow raising and nary a smile or laugh.  Pompeii was the playground of the rich, with an easy lifestyle and lots of revelry (according to the frescoes).  In THIS Pompeii, everyone seems to be angry or just plain barking mad.  Despite being about 160 years old at its destruction, the sets depict the city as brand spanking new - not a scuff anywhere to be seen.  In the big ""games"" scene, Ned Beatty appears to be wearing gold lame - really.  Everyone else is wearing bright, new clothes  - always. I could not tell who was meant to be a servant and who was a citizen. The make up is very strange as well.  Everyone, and I mean everyone, appears to have been treated to some type of spray tan type of foundation.  I guess the director figured they must have had tans since they lived near the coastline of Italy.I could get past all of that if the story had been better.  There were SO many needless peripheral plotlines and since the acting was so stinky, it was hard to care what happened to any of the characters.  It was like all of the actors knew just three expressions: surprise, anger and frown-face.  What a disappointment!Because of the eruption of Vesuvius, Pompeii is the most preserved city in antiquity.  We know how the people lived and because of the plaster casts from Pompeii and the skeletons of Herculaneum and Stabiai,we know how they died.  Admittedly, more information has come to light since the making of this miniseries, but jeez, we knew the basics in 1984.The other reviewers left such glowing remarks, I ordered a copy of this Pompeii.  The only explanation for this is like the experience I had with Rich Man Poor Man.  I was very young and tv was very unsophisticated when that series first aired.  My friends and I just LOVED RMPM.  Last year, when the whole miniseries played on Encore, it wasn't as good as I had remembered it.  It wasn't as terrible as this crap, but it wasn't the blockbuster tv event I had remembered.The real riddle of Pompeii is why can't this story be told properly in a motion picture?  Each retelling is even WORSE than the one before it.As for this version, get ready to cringe, yawn and daydream about stuff you need to be doing around the house.
