More important, the movie is faithful to the spirit of the book.  The characters are appealing, and Max von Sydow manages to play the grandfather's gruff moments without alienating the audience.  Also, the screenwriter obviously learned a thing or two from the previous movie versions and incorporated some of the effective touches from those movies.The Shirley Temple version is very good at the beginning, then the screenwriter throws the book away, and the chase scenes and the cloak-and-dagger intrigue are not only ineffective but embarrassing.The 1952 version shortens the story but adds a nice touch of having her Aunt lie to Heidi about being able to return to the mountains.The 1968 version almost throws the book away and the child is too old for the role, but the scenery and the music are very good.The 1993 version reproduces most of the story of the book but throws the book away at the end.  Also, the characters are totally different, even antithetical, to what they are in the book.  I tried watching it a second time just to be sure and I couldn't make it through the movie.So, this is THE version of the book.The minor departures are the grandfather's angry reaction when Heidi returns.  (Fortunately, this is only momentary.)  And the walking.  The movie has Clara take her first steps as a result of a situation of danger.  Thereafter, however, they do put in the patient physical therapy which the grandfather practices to enable Clara to walk by the end of the summer.A nice touch is the addition of the doctor's role in Dorfli.  None of the other movie versions saw fit to put it in.  This movie not only puts it in but shows why it is important.

Obviously I feel that they don't, and that they should have stuck to the book more closely.  Then there are the accents, which are hard to believe in Switzerland.  And the grandfather telling her to 'get out!' - yea right.  Even the goats got their names changed.  Finally, Heidi doesn't look anything like the Heidi described in the book.

989307,A3J9LLWHZH15HG,B000FFL2H0,JJ,"[2, 5]","I didn't think that anyone could take the story of Heidi and make it not really suitable for small children but they did. This movie is just mean spirited most of the time.  Geraldine Chaplin looks and acts like she just stepped out of a horror movie.  Are both the father and the grandmother so dense that they can't see how horrible she is. So, the father goes off for months at a time and leaves his daughter with this creature. Doesn't make any sense. It's been 60 years since I read the book but I don't remember it being like this movie.  I much prefer the Maximillian Schell/Jean Simmons version.  I could look at that one over and over and actually I have seen it many times.  I'm sure I'll never look at this one again.  The child playing Heidi is too big for the role but she is absolutely precious. Another question is why did they never do anything to make her hair look any better. It always looks greasy and in disarray.  Also, the girl playing Clara already has a bosom and is obviously too old and too big for the role. But, she is charming and one of the few nice characters in the movie. I think they made the Grandfather much too mean. No man with any redeeming features at all would shut his grandchild out of his house when she returns. They just took meanness and gruffness too far. Sebastian, bless his heart, is one of the few nice people she finds in Frankfurt. Why is the maid played so mean. This is, after all, a children's story.  Why are so many of these people so mean and scarey. Even Peter turns mean near the end. What the heck is going on in a film about Heidi when Peter turns mean. I guess they had to set up Clara's walking somehow but they didn't have to do this. So, if you are thinking of ordering this movie for your child, don't do it. I'm 76 years old and I was disturbed by it.  Get the Maximillian Schell/Jean Simmons version. It's an absolute delight from start to finish.

It is not !  The dialog and feel of the film are rather modern and compromise the efforts of the actors/actresses.The grandmother, played by Diana Rigg is excellent.  Fraulein Rottenmeier, played by Geraldine Chaplin (whom I like otherwise), is overplayed and positively villainous.  Clara's father is excellent and so is the Doctor.  Clara was quite good, convincing and definitely in character.The goatherd, besides being given ridiculous lines, is a poor actor. Aunt Dete was sulky and peevish, instead of self-centered and nasty. Unfortunately, Emma Bolger as Heidi disappoints.  She is not well developed as a young actress.  She does not convince one that she is young, innocent, and charming.  Simply, she does not bring Heidi to life.  It would help if her dialog were more convincing as well. Grandfather was bland, or shallow, one of the two.  He was ok, or a little better than ok, that's all.  His lack of dialog was not the reason for this.  For proof, see the Grandfather in the Shirley Temple version.

989314,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000FFL2H0,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 10]","Beloved tale of the little girl Heidi has been often filmed in the past, and probably the most popular one would be the 1937 `Heidi' film starring lovely Shirley Temple. Now another feature film comes from England, starring Emma Bolger (one of the cute sisters in `In America') as the Swiss girl.I don't think this famous story needs introduction, but I may be wrong. Just in case you forget it, it is about an orphaned little girl Heidi (Emma Bolger). Heidi is sent to her grandfather `Uncle Alp' (Max von Sydow) who is living like a hermit up in the Alps with two goats. Her grandfather, whose dark past is vaguely suggested, is at first unwilling to welcome her, but no one can resist the charms of her outgoing personality.The key characters are all there. You will meet Heidi's friend Peter and his blind grandmother, too. And you also remember the inimitable Rottenmeier (played by Geraldine Chaplin) and Clara (Jessica Claridge) and her wheelchair. Diana Rigg also appears as Clara's kind grandmamma. The cast is impressive, to be sure.So we got what we want. We got the right cast (though you may not like the various accents from the cast), and a very good story from Johanna Spyri (as you know it). And fortunately they didn't change it very much. Plus the film is shot in beautiful countryside of Slovenia (on location) and West Wales (on soundstage). But to me, the entire film is slightly disappointing, lacking the weight or impact that the story as I remember it had given to me long time ago.Perhaps that is because the film's script follows the original story too fast, omitting the quiet moments that should have made the characters more round. Clara's character and her friendship with Heidi, one of the most touching part of the story, are often overshadowed by awkwardly presented episodes (about the smuggled kittens that annoy poor Rottenmeier) that try to be funny. In fact, for all the film's decent production designs, `Heidi' sometimes looks as if made for TV (which it is not) because of its hurried and episodic storytelling.Or perhaps the film touches the subject of children's growing-up and education for them too cursorily. Rottenmeier of this film sometimes looks like a theatrical villain (or villainess) from fairy tale, like a witch to be punished, and consequently the film seems to have failed to make a point about one of the most important themes of the original. Of course you don't have to preach - and thank God, `Heidi' is far from preachy, I can assure you - but it is also certain that while director Paul Marcus reminds us of Heidi's illiteracy more than once, the film itself curiously seems unaware of the importance of that.Or perhaps ... well, let's stop now. The fact is, if her accent is not the most convincing, Emma Bolger still gives a very spirited performance as Heidi, which is pure delight to see. Thanks to her adorable Heidi and the good supports, `Heidi' is a decent (if flawed) family film.",3,"I Have Seen a Better Film, But This 'Heidi' Is Still a Decent One (with Emma Bolger from 'In America')",1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,2955,"['Beloved', 'tale', 'little', 'girl', 'Heidi', 'been', 'often', 'filmed', 'past', 'probably', 'most', 'popular', 'one', 'would', 'be', '1937', 'Heidi', 'film', 'starring', 'lovely', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Now', 'feature', 'film', 'England', 'starring', 'Emma', 'Bolger', 'one', 'cute', 'sisters', 'America', 'Swiss', 'girl.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'famous', 'story', 'needs', 'introduction', 'may', 'be', 'wrong', 'Just', 'case', 'forget', 'orphaned', 'little', 'girl', 'Heidi', 'Emma', 'Bolger', 'Heidi', 'sent', 'grandfather', 'Uncle', 'Alp', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'who', 'living', 'hermit', 'up', 'Alps', 'two', 'goats', 'grandfather', 'dark', 'past', 'vaguely', 'suggested', 'first', 'unwilling', 'welcome', 'one', 'can', 'resist', 'charms', 'outgoing', 'personality.The', 'key', 'characters', 'are', 'there', 'will', 'meet', 'Heidi', 'friend', 'Peter', 'blind', 'grandmother', 'too', 'also', 'remember', 'inimitable', 'Rottenmeier', 'played', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin', 'Clara', 'Jessica', 'Claridge', 'wheelchair', 'Diana', 'Rigg', 'also', 'Clara', 'kind', 'grandmamma', 'cast', 'impressive', 'be', 'sure.So', 'got', 'what', 'want', 'got', 'right', 'cast', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'various', 'accents', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'Johanna', 'Spyri', 'know', 'fortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'very', 'much', 'film', 'shot', 'beautiful', 'countryside', 'Slovenia', 'location', 'West', 'Wales', 'soundstage', 'entire', 'film', 'slightly', 'disappointing', 'lacking', 'weight', 'impact', 'story', 'remember', 'had', 'given', 'long', 'time', 'ago.Perhaps', 'film', 'script', 'original', 'story', 'too', 'fast', 'omitting', 'quiet', 'moments', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'characters', 'more', 'round', 'Clara', 'character', 'friendship', 'Heidi', 'one', 'most', 'touching', 'part', 'story', 'are', 'often', 'overshadowed', 'awkwardly', 'presented', 'episodes', 'smuggled', 'kittens', 'annoy', 'poor', 'Rottenmeier', 'try', 'be', 'funny', 'fact', 'film', 'decent', 'production', 'designs', 'Heidi', 'sometimes', 'made', 'TV', 'not', 'hurried', 'episodic', 'storytelling.Or', 'perhaps', 'film', 'subject', 'children', 'growing-up', 'education', 'too', 'cursorily', 'Rottenmeier', 'film', 'sometimes', 'theatrical', 'villain', 'villainess', 'fairy', 'tale', 'witch', 'be', 'punished', 'consequently', 'film', 'have', 'failed', 'make', 'point', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'themes', 'original', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'preach', 'thank', 'God', 'Heidi', 'far', 'preachy', 'can', 'assure', 'also', 'certain', 'director', 'Paul', 'Marcus', 'Heidi', 'illiteracy', 'more', 'once', 'film', 'curiously', 'unaware', 'importance', 'that.Or', 'perhaps', 'well', 'let', 'stop', 'now', 'fact', 'accent', 'not', 'most', 'convincing', 'Emma', 'Bolger', 'still', 'very', 'spirited', 'performance', 'Heidi', 'pure', 'delight', 'see', 'Thanks', 'adorable', 'Heidi', 'good', 'supports', 'Heidi', 'decent', 'flawed', 'family', 'film']",HEIDI (FF)(DVD)
