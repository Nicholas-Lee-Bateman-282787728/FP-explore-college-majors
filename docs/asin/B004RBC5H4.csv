None were in the absolute picture quality I had sought to keep as the pride of my DVD movie library. Finally, this official release has given this movie, Gordon's War the respected picture quality it's original theatrical release had shown us. Gilbert Lewis (remember him as vice lord, Richard Ward's lieutenant and assassin in ""Across 110th Street"") as the ruthless gang lord drug dealer plays the part with such believable realism. Off Limits was not my particular choice in making this purchase, but nevertheless, found it to be quite a thriller as an added bonus feature. My thanks to this studio for giving us Gordon's War in great enjoyable picture quality.

1426390,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B004RBC5H4,DVD Verdict,"[5, 5]","Judge Paul Pritchard, DVD Verdict -- ""With only a few minutes allocated to setting up the story, Gordon's War gets into top gear practically from the off, as Gordon (Paul Winfield) and his crew tackle the drug peddling scum of Harlem corner by corner. It doesn't matter that Gordon is able to set up his operation with little in the way of available resources; the viewer is simply asked to just accept that he has a kickass command post with all kinds of surveillance kit ready to go. The film is hardly an original work, but succeeds by virtue of the craftsmanship that has gone into the film. Victor J. Kemper's cinematography lends the film a gritty aesthetic that in many ways helps paper over the screenplays lack of depth. Likewise, the cast, particularly Paul and Gilbert Lewis, deliver authentic performances that never leave the viewer in any doubt as to how badass these guys are. If Off Limits shares any similarity with Gordon's War, its in the lackluster and rather formulaic plot. Set against the backdrop of war, and dealing with a race-related series of murders, Off Limits has much potential, but not once does it use its setting to its advantage. Rather, writer/director Christopher Crowe (Last of the Mohicans) seems content to put the emphasis on the performances of his cast.  Gregory Hines and Willem Dafoe prove a good combination, but stealing the film from under their noses is Scott Glenn (Sucker Punch), as an out-of-his-mind suspect. His role may be small, but it is memorable for Glenn's near-psychotic reading of the role. Also offering more than able support is Fred Ward (Tremors). These actors do well to keep the viewers attention away from the repetitive plot. Both films are presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic transfers. Gordon's War is generally good, taking into account the film's age and budget. There's a mild level of grain, and occasional signs of damage. Otherwise it's reasonably sharp, with natural colors and good black levels. Off Limits shows signs of damage, with grain and lack of fine detail evident throughout. Each film comes with a commentary track, the first features cinematographer Victor J. Kemper and actor Tony King, who make a surprisingly good combination. The second featuring director Crowe and Dafoe.
