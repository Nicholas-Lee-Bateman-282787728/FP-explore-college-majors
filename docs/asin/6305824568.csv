Every now and then I will check to see if it may be on DVD, but to no avail.  What must you do to make this happen?  If you ever get a chance to see it, do so.

It is a coming of age romance/drama about a young woman in  rural 1950's England and her two loves.  Though the story has a few flaws,  it is done with great sensitivity and it will tug at your heart  strings.Eva (Samantha Morton) works in a sawmill and is being pursued  relentlessly by Harry, a love sick puppy, whose aggressive bravado belies a  deep rooted insecurity.  Eva carries a smoldering ember for her distant and  much older cousin Joseph (Rupert Graves) whom she hasn't seen since she was  a child.  Joseph went off to Italy to become a geologist and lost a leg in  an explosion at the site.  Harry persists in his wooing of Eva and  eventually, she succumbs to his charms.  After they move in together, Eva  sees Joseph at a family wedding and the ember rekindles to a full blown  bonfire.  Joseph returns her affections and Harry becomes Eva's dilemma.  As Harry realizes he's lost her, he has an emotional breakdown and Eva's  guilt brings her back to him.  But Joseph won't give up and he implores her  to leave Harry and come with him to Italy.  So Eva has a decision to make,  love or duty.The film has a lot going for it.  Samantha Morton was  wonderful as the emerging Eva.  She played the part with the tentativeness  and tittering of a young girl, but the sensitivity and tenderness of a  young woman.  Eric Styles, in his first feature did a nice job with the  photography, making it very soft and romantic throughout.  The love scenes  were very well done, more loving than sexual.  Everything was done very  tastefully.  There was no violence, nudity or profanity.  The props and  costumes were true to the period.  Styles needed a little better pacing,  often drawing scenes out beyond what was necessary to convey the message.  This sometimes made the story drag.The story itself has a few flaws.  It was primarily a character study and as such it lacked character  development.  Eva tells her father that she doesn't want to end up like her  mother, but never elaborates.  Harry tells Eva that he doesn't want to end  up like his father, but likewise never explains it.  We know almost nothing  about Eva's early relationship with Joseph that spawned her crush.  A  little bit of background would have helped our understanding of the  characters immensely.Also, Eva decides to move in with Harry after  seeing him for two weeks.  Her father puts up only whimpering resistance  and the townspeople all wink and nod.  No scandal, no gossip.  This is not  very plausible for rural 1950's England.  Also, to think that Eva would  return to Harry after he cheated on her and after her affection had been  returned by her one true love is really a stretch.Lee Ross as Harry was  sometimes very good and sometimes too melodramatic.  He was overly  obsequious with Eva and gave his character very little subtlety.  However  he did a very good job of portraying Harry's torment once things went  sour.I enjoyed this film and rated it a 7/10.  It was a little overly  schmaltzy, but charming.  If you like a sentimental romance you'll probably  enjoy it.",4,Sentimental and Romantic,960854400,"06 13, 2000",2000,3238,"['so', 'often', 'like', 'rummage', 'minor', 'titles', 'see', 'can', 'find', 'sleeper', 'star', 'cast', 'Dreaming', 'Joseph', 'Lees', 'was', 'pleasant', 'find', 'coming', 'age', 'romance/drama', 'young', 'woman', 'rural', '1950', 'England', 'two', 'loves', 'story', 'few', 'flaws', 'done', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'will', 'tug', 'heart', 'strings.Eva', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'sawmill', 'being', 'pursued', 'relentlessly', 'Harry', 'love', 'sick', 'puppy', 'aggressive', 'bravado', 'deep', 'rooted', 'insecurity', 'Eva', 'smoldering', 'ember', 'distant', 'much', 'older', 'cousin', 'Joseph', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'whom', ""n't"", 'seen', 'was', 'child', 'Joseph', 'went', 'Italy', 'become', 'geologist', 'lost', 'leg', 'explosion', 'site', 'Harry', 'wooing', 'Eva', 'eventually', 'succumbs', 'charms', 'move', 'together', 'Eva', 'Joseph', 'family', 'wedding', 'ember', 'full', 'blown', 'bonfire', 'Joseph', 'affections', 'Harry', 'Eva', 'dilemma', 'Harry', 'lost', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'Eva', 'guilt', 'back', 'Joseph', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'leave', 'Harry', 'come', 'Italy', 'So', 'Eva', 'decision', 'make', 'love', 'duty.The', 'film', 'lot', 'going', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'was', 'wonderful', 'emerging', 'Eva', 'played', 'part', 'tentativeness', 'tittering', 'young', 'girl', 'sensitivity', 'tenderness', 'young', 'woman', 'Eric', 'Styles', 'first', 'feature', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'photography', 'making', 'very', 'soft', 'romantic', 'love', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'more', 'loving', 'sexual', 'Everything', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'tastefully', 'was', 'violence', 'nudity', 'profanity', 'props', 'costumes', 'were', 'true', 'period', 'Styles', 'needed', 'little', 'better', 'pacing', 'often', 'drawing', 'scenes', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'necessary', 'convey', 'message', 'sometimes', 'made', 'story', 'drag.The', 'story', 'few', 'flaws', 'was', 'primarily', 'character', 'study', 'such', 'lacked', 'character', 'development', 'Eva', 'father', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'up', 'mother', 'never', 'Harry', 'Eva', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'up', 'father', 'likewise', 'never', 'know', 'almost', 'nothing', 'Eva', 'early', 'relationship', 'Joseph', 'spawned', 'crush', 'little', 'bit', 'background', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'understanding', 'characters', 'immensely.Also', 'Eva', 'move', 'Harry', 'seeing', 'two', 'weeks', 'father', 'up', 'only', 'whimpering', 'resistance', 'townspeople', 'wink', 'nod', 'scandal', 'gossip', 'not', 'very', 'plausible', 'rural', '1950', 'England', 'Also', 'think', 'Eva', 'would', 'return', 'Harry', 'cheated', 'affection', 'had', 'been', 'returned', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'really', 'stretch.Lee', 'Ross', 'Harry', 'was', 'sometimes', 'very', 'good', 'sometimes', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'was', 'overly', 'obsequious', 'Eva', 'gave', 'character', 'very', 'little', 'subtlety', 'However', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'Harry', 'torment', 'once', 'things', 'went', 'sour.I', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'rated', '7/10', 'was', 'little', 'overly', 'schmaltzy', 'charming', 'like', 'sentimental', 'romance', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy']",N/A

(Rupert Graves).It has been years since Eva has seen Joseph, a geologist who has been to Italy and Africa, and has also lost a leg in a quarry accident.She carries his picture with her and often stares at it and daydreams of him.Life,though,is happening all around her.She has been taking care of her widowed father and younger sister,Janie ( a really interesting character aptly portrayed by Lauren Richardson),and she is emerging as a young woman with desires.Harry Flite (Lee Ross),a local farmer is compulsively smitten with Eva and actively pursues her for what he believes is true love.Eva keeps him somewhat at arms length, but for whatever reason succumbs to his advances and moves in to his farmhouse.Eva,though,hears that Joseph has returned home and will be at a family wedding.Her dreams are revived when she at last meets Joseph again.This is where the action really begins!Eva has put herself in a really compromised position.She has now set up house with Harry who we now discover is not so much in love with Eva as much as he is in NEED of her to take care of him.Eva has been taking care of people her entire life and now sees her chance to have the man of her dreams;but the turmoil and the price that she will have to pay will cost her and all of those around her.There is NO easy solution and Eva has put herself in an absolutely NO WIN situation.What is great about this particular screenplay is that there is NO REAL FINAL SOLUTION to everyone's dilemma,which is a genius move on the part of the filmmakers,and  the audience is left in an unresolved state!This is a very interesting film.It can be viewed by some as being a bit on the gloomy side.The scenes shift rather swiftly in places which allow alot of loose ends which hamper character development.Still this film has beautiful camera and lighting effects and a haunting soundtrack by Zbigniew Preisner which make for a truly artistic experience.The use of Eva's sister, Janie, as the catalyst through which Eva's thoughts and actions are conveyed are similar to the ""Greek Chorus"" of Hellenist writing.Janie's commentary runs throughout the film,and she prophetically states that ""Promises are made to keep.Promises will make you weep"" while throwing her ball against a wall.Though all of the performances are uniformly good,this is definitely a film that showcases the immense talents of a younger Samantha Morton who has since become one of the finest and most revered actresses in the world.",4,"""Promises are made to keep.Promises will make you weep!""",1175731200,"04 5,

480231,A2SKB8KZ6BQK3U,6305824568,"""outhousebob""","[11, 11]","Dreaming of Joseph Lees is the quintessential little movie, British style. It is a beautifully photographed movie played by a cast of genuine actors you probably never heard of. The setting is rural England (actually photographed on the Isle of Man) in the late 1950's. It is a love story with a classic triangle. There is not a wasted scene, not a wasted moment.Eva is a young woman who dreams romantically of an older second cousin, Joepth Lees, she remembers from when she was a girl. Joseph is a geologist who works in Italy where he lost a leg in a quarry accident. Eva thinks about him a lot, has heard about him from time to time but has not seen him in many years. In the meantime, she has come of age, has finished school and works in a lumber mill while also caring for her elderly father and younger sister. One of the local boys who works at the mill and tends his farm, Harry, is interested in Eva and lets her know repeatedly in a rather crude way. Eventually, seeing no other hope for male companionship, she moves in with Harry. Guess who shows up at that point? The remainder of the movie is Eva's emotional see-saw as she tries to decide between Joseph and Harry. There are hints (some metaphoric, some unexpected, some both) as to outcome along the way. She finally chooses, and the movie ends as it must.  Although some things about the movie do not quite ring true (they could not, at least, have happened in rural America during the same time period), it is a good period piece. Someone suggested it is not a subtle movie but neither the sex nor the violence, both are present, are played strongly. By American standards the movie is subtle. Nothing is blown up in a ball of fire. Most of the blood is just from a nosebleed. There are no gimmicks. The movie rides on the photography, the acting and the story, just like any movie should.And how are those features? The photography is superb. The acting is flawless. The story is good, certainly good enough to make a worthwhile vehicle for the visuals and for the acting.",4,Beautifully Photographed,975283200,"11 27, 2000",2000,2043,"['Dreaming', 'Joseph', 'Lees', 'quintessential', 'little', 'movie', 'British', 'style', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'movie', 'played', 'cast', 'genuine', 'actors', 'probably', 'never', 'heard', 'setting', 'rural', 'England', 'actually', 'photographed', 'Isle', 'Man', 'late', '1950', 'love', 'story', 'classic', 'triangle', 'not', 'wasted', 'scene', 'not', 'wasted', 'moment.Eva', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'romantically', 'older', 'second', 'cousin', 'Joepth', 'Lees', 'remembers', 'when', 'was', 'girl', 'Joseph', 'geologist', 'who', 'Italy', 'where', 'lost', 'leg', 'quarry', 'accident', 'Eva', 'lot', 'heard', 'time', 'time', 'not', 'seen', 'many', 'years', 'meantime', 'come', 'age', 'finished', 'school', 'lumber', 'mill', 'also', 'caring', 'elderly', 'father', 'younger', 'sister', 'One', 'local', 'boys', 'who', 'mill', 'farm', 'Harry', 'interested', 'Eva', 'know', 'repeatedly', 'rather', 'crude', 'way', 'Eventually', 'seeing', 'other', 'hope', 'male', 'companionship', 'Harry', 'Guess', 'who', 'up', 'point', 'remainder', 'movie', 'Eva', 'emotional', 'see-saw', 'decide', 'Joseph', 'Harry', 'are', 'hints', 'metaphoric', 'unexpected', 'outcome', 'way', 'finally', 'movie', 'must', 'things', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'quite', 'ring', 'true', 'could', 'not', 'least', 'have', 'happened', 'rural', 'America', 'same', 'time', 'period', 'good', 'period', 'piece', 'Someone', 'suggested', 'not', 'subtle', 'movie', 'sex', 'violence', 'are', 'present', 'are', 'played', 'strongly', 'American', 'standards', 'movie', 'subtle', 'Nothing', 'blown', 'up', 'ball', 'fire', 'Most', 'blood', 'just', 'nosebleed', 'are', 'gimmicks', 'movie', 'photography', 'acting', 'story', 'just', 'movie', 'should.And', 'how', 'are', 'features', 'photography', 'superb', 'acting', 'flawless', 'story', 'good', 'certainly', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'vehicle', 'visuals', 'acting']",N/A

Joseph went to the war and lost a leg there, and a more grown up Eva now wonders what has become of Joseph, although she  would never admit it to her family.Local lad Harry is always pursuing  Eva, and it's obvious he only has one thing in mind, which in the end,  reflects badly on Eva, who after proclaiming that she will never &quot;go  to heaven&quot; with Harry, goes ahead and does the deed with him  anyway.Soon after, however, Eva runs into Joseph at a wedding and her  crush returns full force, but it's no longer a girlish crush.  Gentle  Joseph returns the affection but he soon discovers Eva's relationship with  Harry (they live together now) and goes home.Eva follows Joseph, leaving  behind Harry, who gets more and more unstable with every passing second,  and what he ends up doing to win Eva back is nearly unbelievable.The  biggest flaw here is the character of Eva.  I agree with the reviewer below  that it's pretty amazing that she moves in with Harry soon after telling  him off, not to mention that she goes back to him after his infidelity.
