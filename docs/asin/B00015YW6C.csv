If you know a thing or two about history, you will understand that it's only because it's basically a propaganda film...and understandably so. The lines are wooden and the scenes lack a certain believable quality, but the context of the times lends the film a poignant atmosphere that connects us with the fear and uncertainty that the participants of these missions lived through. Perhaps you have to have lived through the 1940's to understand why such simple ideas had a powerful impact on the hopes and dreams of an entire American generation.",3,Arial Gunner is like a cloudy mirror which reflects a time in which there was no place for equivocation.,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,638,"['How', 'can', 'review', 'movie', 'modern', 'audience', 'entertainment', 'quality', 'lacking', 'know', 'thing', 'two', 'history', 'will', 'understand', 'only', 'basically', 'propaganda', 'film', 'understandably', 'so', 'lines', 'are', 'wooden', 'scenes', 'lack', 'certain', 'believable', 'quality', 'context', 'times', 'film', 'poignant', 'atmosphere', 'fear', 'uncertainty', 'participants', 'missions', 'lived', 'Perhaps', 'have', 'have', 'lived', '1940', 'understand', 'why', 'such', 'simple', 'ideas', 'had', 'powerful', 'impact', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'entire', 'American', 'generation']",N/A

Several hundred of these were taken expediently from Lend-Lease manufacture into USAAF and USN inventory after Pearl Harbor, and the Hudson is listed as having achieved the USAAF's first antisubmarine warfare (ASW) kill in the Atlantic after the formal opening of hostilities.Interestingly, the bomber in the movie is depicted as having a tail gunner's position (it did not) and as having a single waist gunner (ditto).  Hudson aircraft taken into the US inventory commonly had the big British Boulton-Paul dual .303 MG waist turret removed, to be replaced with a simple single-weapon .50 caliber dorsal firing station (like the one depicted in the movie as being manned by the radio operator).  The previous reviewer's confusion is therefore somewhat understandable.  Hopefully, enemy viewers of the movie also drew false impressions about the Hudson, and didn't as readily seek to exploit the aircraft's posterior and ventral vulnerabilities.As for the film itself, the most interesting part was the depiction of aerial gunnery training, which definitely did include shooting skeet in order to give the trainees better preparatory conditioning for deflection shooting.---",3,Not really a B-25 at all...,1092441600,"08 14, 2004",2004,1435,"['earlier', 'review', 'more', 'properly', 'Lockheed', 'Hudson', 'light', 'bomber', 'rated', 'attack', 'plane', 'USAAF', 'A-28', 'A-29', 'was', 'converted', 'combat', 'aircraft', 'fast', 'civilian', 'airliner', 'British', 'specifications', 'war', 'Several', 'hundred', 'were', 'taken', 'expediently', 'Lend-Lease', 'manufacture', 'USAAF', 'USN', 'inventory', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Hudson', 'listed', 'having', 'achieved', 'USAAF', 'first', 'antisubmarine', 'warfare', 'ASW', 'kill', 'Atlantic', 'formal', 'opening', 'hostilities.Interestingly', 'bomber', 'movie', 'depicted', 'having', 'tail', 'gunner', 'position', 'did', 'not', 'having', 'single', 'waist', 'gunner', 'ditto', 'Hudson', 'aircraft', 'taken', 'US', 'inventory', 'commonly', 'had', 'big', 'British', 'Boulton-Paul', 'dual', '.303', 'MG', 'waist', 'turret', 'removed', 'be', 'replaced', 'simple', 'single-weapon', '.50', 'caliber', 'dorsal', 'firing', 'station', 'one', 'depicted', 'movie', 'being', 'manned', 'radio', 'operator', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'confusion', 'therefore', 'somewhat', 'understandable', 'Hopefully', 'enemy', 'viewers', 'movie', 'also', 'drew', 'false', 'impressions', 'Hudson', 'did', ""n't"", 'readily', 'seek', 'exploit', 'aircraft', 'posterior', 'ventral', 'vulnerabilities.As', 'film', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'was', 'depiction', 'aerial', 'gunnery', 'training', 'definitely', 'did', 'include', 'shooting', 'skeet', 'order', 'give', 'trainees', 'better', 'preparatory', 'conditioning', 'deflection', 'shooting.']",N/A

They are a look into the heart and soul of an era that existed more than half a century ago when war encompassed the globe for a second time. Young men entered military service and women became part of the work force. War and romance were inevitably linked. This film offers an interesting story with information that is, for the most part, accurate. Harlingen, Texas  was indeed home to the 'aerial gunnery school' and the training is well described and accurate.  The two heroes had known each other since childhood and came from very different backgrounds that led to their antagonistic attitude toward each other. As fate would have it, both were assigned to the same course for aerial gunner school. The young lady? The sister of one of their classmates. Follow their path of bravery and courage from the Pacific Theater to the single hospital bed where the story is being told.
