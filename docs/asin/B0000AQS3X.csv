This was a favorite part of ""Social Studies"" for me, back in the days when the teacher wheeled out a huge projector & reels of film to show us this one week and the great old Bell Labs science series [Like this one: [ASIN:B0000AKY5Z Our Mr. Sun/Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays]] on alternate Thursday afternoons.What a great way to learn your history!  Victory at Sea explores the US's naval battles during WWII in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters.  You'll learn about German U-Boats, Japanese destroyers & more, as each segment looks at a specific battle/encounter in depth.  And the score was written by Richard Rodgers (yes, of Rodgers & Hammerstein fame) and performed by the RCA orchestra.Yes, it's black & white.  No, there are no digital special effects.  Yes, there's more than a touch of patriotic propaganda here and there.

767278,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B0000AQS3X,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","This MILL CREEK edition of VICTORY AT SEA (note cover art with yellow lettering) was issued prior to that company's cheapening of their DVD boxes (with discs stored in black paper sleeves). Here, all three single side/dual layer DVDs have separate spindles, with #2 mounted on a flippable page. As with most MCE sets, there's no literature, liner note booklet, subtitles or other extras. Dubs appear to be from videotapes of unrestored 16 mm broadcast film. This is apparent because of occasional audio dropouts similar to those heard on imperfect magnetic tape linear tracks. Although specks, fade marks and other film anomalies are visible, there's no break repairs on any of the 26 half-hour episodes, and all are complete programs..Emmy winning VICTORY AT SEA originally aired Sunday afternoons on the NBC network. It was the creation of Harry Salomon, a former Navy man who had assisted in writing a 15 volumeHistory of United States Naval Operations in World War II. Technical advice for the series was provided by Walter Karig, an ex-Navy captain who also authored WWII volumes, but is best remembered, especially by fans of producer/director William Castle, for his 1947 novel,ZOTZ!Broadway's Richard Rodgers provided twelve themes for this series. In 1953, Rodgers and lyricist Oscar Hammerstein used his ""Beneath the Southern Cross"" theme (heard in three episodes) for their musicalME AND JULIET, as the song ""No Other Love (Have I)."" It was that show's most memorable tune.Robert Russell Bennett fleshed out Rodgers piano compositions for the NBC Symphony orchestra. Much has been made of this program's score (thesoundtrack LPwas a favorite of Pres. Nixon, for example), but I think it's intrusively LOUD and gets potted down only when narrator Leonard Graves is heard.The strongest element of VICTORY AT SEA is its newsreel and other actual war footage, gathered from Allied and former enemy sources around the world. The best episode visually may be #25, which shows several kamikaze pilots crashing into Navy vessels. All episodes however are exceptional examples of how television can be used to educate and inform. Prior to VICTORY AT SEA, there had been no TV documentary series, and its success assured the future of this vital format.

It is not possible to hear the narration when the level is set for the music score. With the level set for the narration, the music track is too loud for the music-only passages.""The narration on these DVDs, when you can hear it, sounds thin and reedy, as if it was fed through a telephone line.""This problem has nothing to do with the age of the original material. I have Victory at Sea on laser disc. The audio on them is fine when played through my TV or through the same sound system that I use for DVD. The sound was fine on the VHS release. The sound has been consistently fine when the series was shown on TV over the years. And the sound, with Richard Rogers acclaimed score, was fine when the series first ran on NBC when I was a boy.""This release is just fine. Many of the episodes have a volume number superimposed on the title screen (""Volume 5"" for instance).

767280,A38O6C1A8AWUGH,B0000AQS3X,A reader,"[6, 22]","This DVD release of the 1952-1953 TV series is no credit to NBC or the History Channel.They missed a unique opportunity to upgrade this. Even for the time, the narration was simplistic, inaccurate, and bombastic. A second audio track should have been added with an updated, intelligent and calm voice-over. The absence of subtitles is another mistake. As little as was being said, in words and content, this would have been easy. The introductions by Peter Graves give a small measure of continuity between episodes, but they are not enough.Having said that, watching this with the sound off is an option. The musical score by Richard Rodgers was lovely, but it grates with repetition and sometimes inappropriateuse.The real value of this series is in the combat footage, some of which was captured from Axis sources.  For the 50s, it is surprising that it was so graphic- burned, bloated, fly-blown bodies, dead children, the wounded screaming in pain, all those details present-day media sanitizes to `protect' us. If this was shown uncut, it would certainly be an exception to the `vast wasteland' of most of 50s TV.War is hell, but this show, which tried so hard to communicate that, ends up getting in the way of its own message.",2,NBC and History Channel Should Be Ashamed,1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,1234,"['DVD', 'release', '1952-1953', 'TV', 'series', 'credit', 'NBC', 'History', 'Channel.They', 'missed', 'unique', 'opportunity', 'upgrade', 'Even', 'time', 'narration', 'was', 'simplistic', 'inaccurate', 'bombastic', 'second', 'audio', 'track', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'updated', 'intelligent', 'calm', 'voice-over', 'absence', 'subtitles', 'mistake', 'As', 'little', 'was', 'being', 'said', 'words', 'content', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'introductions', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'give', 'small', 'measure', 'continuity', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'enough.Having', 'said', 'watching', 'sound', 'off', 'option', 'musical', 'score', 'Richard', 'Rodgers', 'was', 'lovely', 'repetition', 'sometimes', 'inappropriateuse.The', 'real', 'value', 'series', 'combat', 'footage', 'was', 'captured', 'Axis', 'sources', '50s', 'surprising', 'was', 'so', 'graphic-', 'burned', 'bloated', 'fly-blown', 'bodies', 'dead', 'children', 'wounded', 'screaming', 'pain', 'details', 'present-day', 'media', 'protect', 'was', 'shown', 'uncut', 'would', 'certainly', 'be', 'exception', 'vast', 'wasteland', 'most', '50s', 'TV.War', 'hell', 'show', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'communicate', 'up', 'getting', 'way', 'own', 'message']",N/A

So when I got the disks from N-----x, I was disappointed almost beyond words.  Maybe I'm just spoiled by the quality of documentaries today, but the truth is that this is not good at all by the standards of the 21st century.  I recognize that in its day, it was groundbreaking, but it's not 1952 any more.Many of the scenes are obviously staged -- toy boats, dramatizations, scenes from movies -- and the dialogue is straight out of the propaganda films from the war such as ""Why We Fight.""  It's overwrought and sarcastic in places, often seeming to delight in the death of the enemy.And the music is just awful, especially if you watch several episodes in a row.  Very repetitious, actually lulling me to sleep in the Malta episode.  But then it gets VERY LOUD!! and wakes you up again.  And it never stops.  Music should be a condiment, not a main course, especially music like this.And many of the most interesting, meaningful battles of the war are simply glossed over.  In the episode of Guadalcanal, they treated it so lightly that they had time in the middle of the show for a shout-out to the folks back home.  There are no interviews of people who were there (at least on the first disk, which is as far as I could stand).If you are looking for some television history, I'd recommend this film.

767285,A3VDVWMUNBN38R,B0000AQS3X,"Bruce Eder ""recording maven""","[2, 2]","NOTE: THIS REVIEW APPLIES TO THE AUTHORIZED HISTORY CHANNEL/NBC DVD SET OF VICTORY AT SEA.There were so many complaints posted about aspects of the quality of this set, that I didn't buy it for a long time. And yes, under ideal circumstances one imagines that the History Channel and the producers of this DVD set could have gone back to the sources deeper than the finished programs for the sound. But in fact, it's only the first segment, so far, that was highly deficient in volume, and there were almost certainly solid technical reasons for that to be the case. These are 60-year-old television productions, done at a time when no one was sure that television was going to be around half that long, much less that these particular programs would matter to anyone, or be seen in digital video on home monitors and played on equipment more sophisticated than anything one might have conceived of finding at the time outside of David Sarnoff's inner sanctum (and we'd still have the edge today . . . .). And in truth, there's only so much money to be made from their release and, by extension, only so much that anyone can spend producing them -- so they went with the sound from the best finished master sources.The quality is generally very acceptable to very good, and the picture (and sound) are better than I remember them on my family's old Philco TV set circa 1962 -- as to the programs themselves, they were rightfully considered highly informative at the time and still hold up if one watches one installment a week, as the producers intended. If some of the narrative seems a little over-the-top and over-ripe, nobody was really sure at the time precisely how to approach this whole subject, or even if home audiences would tune in for two weeks (or one), much less 26, to look at this subject -- the movie studios had only lately discovered that audiences would pay money to see good (or great) pictures about the war (Battleground etc.), after avoiding such productions for several years, but it wasn't clear whether enough people wanted this coming into their living rooms every week to justify NBC's effort. And some of the episodes or, more correctly, corners of them do sometimes seem like an odd tap-dance for the producers, who occasionally find the need to fill time with tributes to the home-front and our industrial might, when they've run out of things to say about the actual event being covered in the particular segment. I last saw these programs when they were broadcast in syndication by WPIX-Channel 11 in New York in the early 1960s, and I'm pleased to have them in my collection today, looking (and mostly sounding) very good, though I do think that Leonard Graves has his limitations as a narrator.What's more, it is interesting and fulfilling, after decades of familiarity with the Richard Rodgers/Robert Russell Bennett score (and it is mostly Bennett's work expanding on Rodgers' themes) as free-standing music, to once more see the images with which the composer/arranger/conductor team were working in devising the music. The latter, incidentally, is available in numerous different ""original"" incarnations on CD, of which the best is the disc whose artwork depicts the smoking cauldron of Pearl Harbor in black-and-white. Come to think of it, it's just a pity that no one at RCA/BMG ever tried to put together a Complete Victory At Sea CD box set with all of the mono and stereo recordings, or that Sony/BMG never did a Victory At Sea ""original jacket""-type CD box -- I'd buy it.",4,"A Fascinating Window On the Past, and How We Looked At It",1347235200,"09 10, 2012",2012,3518,"['NOTE', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'APPLIES', 'TO', 'THE', 'AUTHORIZED', 'HISTORY', 'CHANNEL/NBC', 'DVD', 'SET', 'OF', 'VICTORY', 'AT', 'SEA.There', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'complaints', 'posted', 'aspects', 'quality', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'long', 'time', 'yes', 'ideal', 'circumstances', 'one', 'imagines', 'History', 'Channel', 'producers', 'DVD', 'set', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'back', 'sources', 'deeper', 'finished', 'programs', 'sound', 'fact', 'only', 'first', 'segment', 'so', 'far', 'was', 'highly', 'deficient', 'volume', 'were', 'almost', 'certainly', 'solid', 'technical', 'reasons', 'be', 'case', 'are', '60-year-old', 'television', 'productions', 'done', 'time', 'when', 'one', 'was', 'sure', 'television', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'long', 'much', 'less', 'particular', 'programs', 'would', 'matter', 'anyone', 'be', 'seen', 'digital', 'video', 'home', 'monitors', 'played', 'equipment', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'anything', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'conceived', 'finding', 'time', 'David', 'Sarnoff', 'inner', 'sanctum', ""'d"", 'still', 'have', 'edge', 'today', 'truth', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'be', 'made', 'release', 'extension', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'anyone', 'can', 'spend', 'producing', 'went', 'sound', 'best', 'finished', 'master', 'sources.The', 'quality', 'generally', 'very', 'acceptable', 'very', 'good', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'better', 'remember', 'family', 'old', 'Philco', 'TV', 'set', 'circa', '1962', 'programs', 'were', 'rightfully', 'considered', 'highly', 'informative', 'time', 'still', 'hold', 'up', 'one', 'one', 'installment', 'week', 'producers', 'intended', 'narrative', 'little', 'over-the-top', 'over-ripe', 'nobody', 'was', 'really', 'sure', 'time', 'precisely', 'how', 'approach', 'whole', 'subject', 'even', 'home', 'audiences', 'would', 'tune', 'two', 'weeks', 'one', 'much', 'less', '26', 'look', 'subject', 'movie', 'studios', 'had', 'only', 'lately', 'discovered', 'audiences', 'would', 'pay', 'money', 'see', 'good', 'great', 'war', 'Battleground', 'etc', 'avoiding', 'such', 'productions', 'several', 'years', 'was', ""n't"", 'clear', 'enough', 'people', 'wanted', 'coming', 'living', 'rooms', 'week', 'justify', 'NBC', 'effort', 'episodes', 'more', 'correctly', 'corners', 'do', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'odd', 'tap-dance', 'producers', 'who', 'occasionally', 'find', 'need', 'fill', 'time', 'tributes', 'home-front', 'industrial', 'might', 'when', ""'ve"", 'run', 'things', 'say', 'actual', 'event', 'being', 'covered', 'particular', 'segment', 'last', 'saw', 'programs', 'when', 'were', 'broadcast', 'syndication', 'WPIX-Channel', '11', 'New', 'York', 'early', '1960s', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'have', 'collection', 'today', 'looking', 'mostly', 'sounding', 'very', 'good', 'do', 'think', 'Leonard', 'Graves', 'limitations', 'more', 'interesting', 'fulfilling', 'decades', 'familiarity', 'Richard', 'Rodgers/Robert', 'Russell', 'Bennett', 'score', 'mostly', 'Bennett', 'work', 'expanding', 'Rodgers', 'themes', 'free-standing', 'music', 'once', 'more', 'see', 'images', 'composer/arranger/conductor', 'team', 'were', 'working', 'devising', 'music', 'latter', 'incidentally', 'available', 'numerous', 'different', 'original', 'incarnations', 'CD', 'best', 'disc', 'artwork', 'smoking', 'cauldron', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'black-and-white', 'Come', 'think', 'just', 'pity', 'one', 'RCA/BMG', 'ever', 'tried', 'put', 'together', 'Complete', 'Victory', 'Sea', 'CD', 'box', 'set', 'mono', 'stereo', 'recordings', 'Sony/BMG', 'never', 'did', 'Victory', 'Sea', 'original', 'jacket', '-type', 'CD', 'box', ""'d"", 'buy']",N/A

As other reviewers have noted, the music is too loud and the narration is too soft on the History Channel set; the viewer must constantly adjust the volume to hear Leonard Graves' voice-over and to avoid being blown out by the formidable Richard Rodgers score. Both come through crisp and clear--and at equal volume--on the Mill Creek discs.""Victory at Sea"" was an NBC TV series first broadcast in 1952 using combat footage and period films along with some re-enactments, which were obviously made within seven years of the war's end, so none of the source material was up to 21st-century standards to begin with.

767298,A26HFSVLAGULIM,B0000AQS3X,"Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[3, 11]","ABOUT THE DVD: NOT AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE VHSOn the box of this 'Millcreek Entertainment' 3-Disk DVD set, it says ""DIGITALLY RE-MASTERED ON DVDs"". That statement is why I bought this set as I already have it on VHS. Unfortunately, this set does NOT play better than the VHS editions, but at least the DVDs will NOT degrade over time the way VHS recordings do. I paid $5.50 for the set, so I have no regrets.IN A NUTSHELL:This famous [or infamous depending on one's viewpoint] World War 2 documentary series, originally produced and presented in 1952-1953 by NBC, consists of 26 half-hour segments. Each segment deals with a specific theme and the segments are in chronological order.In presenting the history of the naval war associated with World War 2, 'Victory At Sea' made excellent use of rare film clips from the actual battles depicted, including some which were captured from German and Japanese combat and newsreel footage.  The soundtrack, composed by Richard Rodgers, became a hit record. The series won several awards and ran forever in rerun syndication -- and, in 1954, was spun off into a theatrical feature.WHAT 'VICTORY AT SEA' IS ALL ABOUT: NATIONALISM - PATRIOTISM - PROPAGANDAAll of the above completely ignores what the series was all about and what makes it historically important. 3 words, NATIONALISM - PATRIOTISM and PROPAGANDA, says it all. The best example of this is seen in segment titled, 'THE PACIFIC BOILS OVER' which depicts the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The 6 minute sequence within this segment showing the injured and dying American Seamen, smoldering and sunken American Battleships, and American airplanes burning in their hangars and on the airstrips, is a very emotional piece of film which accompanied with very melancholy music, written for this sequence by Richard Rodgers, still affects me very deeply. Then, hope is delivered as the sunken capital ships are shown resurrected and rebuilt, along with a hopeful soundtrack. For the aforementioned reasons, just getting 'The Pacific Boils Over' is reason enough to purchase this set in my view.BOTTOM LINE: SIMILAR IN TONE TO FRANK CAPRA'S 'WHY WE FIGHT' SERIESThis is potent but rather one-sided stuff. Nevertheless, much can be learned from viewing this set especially in the area of influencing public opinion. My one big problem with this series is the same one I had when I saw this series as a youngster a 1/2 century ago; the tone of the series seemed about 10 years too late, for by now [1950s] the differences had been settled between the warring nations and healing NOT finger-pointing was really what was needed. Seeing a 'film' depiction of Japanese pilots grinning maniacially from their torpedo bombers as they delivered their lethal payloads to the soon to be doomed American vessels filled with sleeping young sailors, really seemed like a cheap shot against the Japanese, now ten years after the war.",4,A MUST HAVE DOCUMENTARY SERIES ABOUT WORLD WAR 2 WHICH HIGHLIGHTED PATRIOTISM & PROPAGANDA AT WARTIME INTENSITY,1167523200,"12 31, 2006",2006,2928,"['THE', 'DVD', 'NOT', 'AN', 'IMPROVEMENT', 'THE', 'VHSOn', 'box', ""'Millcreek"", 'Entertainment', '3-Disk', 'DVD', 'set', 'DIGITALLY', 'RE-MASTERED', 'ON', 'DVDs', 'statement', 'why', 'bought', 'set', 'already', 'have', 'VHS', 'Unfortunately', 'set', 'NOT', 'play', 'better', 'VHS', 'editions', 'least', 'DVDs', 'will', 'NOT', 'degrade', 'time', 'way', 'VHS', 'recordings', 'do', 'paid', '5.50', 'set', 'have', 'regrets.IN', 'NUTSHELL', 'famous', '[', 'infamous', 'depending', 'one', 'viewpoint', ']', 'World', 'War', '2', 'documentary', 'series', 'originally', 'produced', 'presented', '1952-1953', 'NBC', '26', 'half-hour', 'segments', 'segment', 'deals', 'specific', 'theme', 'segments', 'are', 'chronological', 'order.In', 'presenting', 'history', 'naval', 'war', 'associated', 'World', 'War', '2', ""'Victory"", 'Sea', 'made', 'excellent', 'use', 'rare', 'film', 'clips', 'actual', 'battles', 'depicted', 'including', 'were', 'captured', 'German', 'Japanese', 'combat', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'soundtrack', 'composed', 'Richard', 'Rodgers', 'became', 'hit', 'record', 'series', 'won', 'several', 'awards', 'ran', 'forever', 'rerun', 'syndication', '1954', 'was', 'spun', 'off', 'theatrical', 'feature.WHAT', 'AT', 'SEA', 'IS', 'ALL', 'ABOUT', 'NATIONALISM', 'PATRIOTISM', 'PROPAGANDAAll', 'above', 'completely', 'what', 'series', 'was', 'what', 'historically', 'important', '3', 'words', 'NATIONALISM', 'PATRIOTISM', 'PROPAGANDA', 'best', 'example', 'seen', 'segment', 'titled', 'PACIFIC', 'BOILS', 'OVER', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'December', '7', '1941', '6', 'minute', 'sequence', 'segment', 'showing', 'injured', 'dying', 'American', 'Seamen', 'smoldering', 'sunken', 'American', 'Battleships', 'American', 'airplanes', 'burning', 'hangars', 'airstrips', 'very', 'emotional', 'piece', 'film', 'accompanied', 'very', 'melancholy', 'music', 'written', 'sequence', 'Richard', 'Rodgers', 'still', 'very', 'deeply', 'Then', 'hope', 'delivered', 'sunken', 'capital', 'ships', 'are', 'shown', 'resurrected', 'rebuilt', 'hopeful', 'soundtrack', 'aforementioned', 'reasons', 'just', 'getting', 'Pacific', 'Boils', 'Over', 'reason', 'enough', 'purchase', 'set', 'view.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'SIMILAR', 'IN', 'TONE', 'TO', 'FRANK', 'CAPRA', ""'WHY"", 'WE', 'FIGHT', 'SERIESThis', 'potent', 'rather', 'one-sided', 'stuff', 'Nevertheless', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'learned', 'viewing', 'set', 'especially', 'area', 'influencing', 'public', 'opinion', 'one', 'big', 'problem', 'series', 'same', 'one', 'had', 'when', 'saw', 'series', 'youngster', '1/2', 'century', 'ago', 'tone', 'series', 'seemed', '10', 'years', 'too', 'late', 'now', '1950s', 'differences', 'had', 'been', 'settled', 'warring', 'nations', 'healing', 'NOT', 'finger-pointing', 'was', 'really', 'what', 'was', 'needed', 'Seeing', ""'film"", 'depiction', 'Japanese', 'pilots', 'grinning', 'maniacially', 'torpedo', 'bombers', 'delivered', 'lethal', 'payloads', 'soon', 'be', 'doomed', 'American', 'vessels', 'filled', 'sleeping', 'young', 'sailors', 'really', 'seemed', 'cheap', 'shot', 'Japanese', 'now', 'ten', 'years', 'war']",N/A

Now I mention that because I read too many reviews that said this footage is too Analog, and Oh no, God forbid, it's even in ( Dare I say the the words), BLACK AND WHITE?  Yeah, Black & White film, not Digital, was the format of choice in the 40's.  So if you want to see what I saw on TV in the 50's, get this Extraordinary collection of films re-formated to DVD, then sit back, sip a cool one, and count your blessings that we had a bunch of Americans that was willing to step up, and fight back.  Young thankless Americans have no idea today what took place during that time, and it's probably because the uncaring public schools have stopped teaching American HIstory.  Well, you will get some here on these DVD's, and your chest will swell with pride when you see Allied Forces kick  butt on the high seas, and on Pacific Islands of the Pacific.  Some of the new High Tech guys say it's disappointing that they could tell some of the shots were re-enactments of battles, and that degrades the series, yeah right!  Having been to Viet Nam, I can till you that getting a Live Fire Action on film is not an easy thing.  Staying alive is not an easy thing, taking a hit is, and filming a Fire Fight is not a wise thing to try.  Ahhh, yeah, I'll go for the re-enactmet, thank you.  So, Check It Out and see some live stuff from Pearl, and the Island, but realize, not all battles could be filmed.  Now, as for the music, the film still has the TV sound, which is so heart moving, but if you want clean orchestration with great Fidelity, get the CD of Richard Rogers fully orchestrated and recorded on more modern Stereophonic surround sound equipment.  Some of the reviewers think this equipment has always been in existence, and have poo-poo'd the soundtrack.  Duh!  Listen, one more time please.  Buy it, view it, File it!

Narrated by Leonard Graves and featuring a fine musical score by Richard Rodgers, this series offers a remarkable look at naval warfare and the challenges faced by the Allies.Every major naval engagement of World War II is covered, from the devastating U-Boat attacks on Allied shipping to the great carrier battles of the Pacific Theatre.  Developed from over 13,000 hours of footage shot by the U.S., German, British, and Japanese navies, this documentary presents a unique perspective on the war at sea.I've been a fan of this series since I was a child watching it on public television, and I was thrilled that it has finally been released on DVD.  Every aspect has been faithfully reproduced; from the opening ocean and waves scene to Rodgers' classic musical introduction.  The sound quality could have been a little better, but that is a minor detail in my opinion.  The episodes still contain the same great action footage and excellent narration by Leonard Graves.  In addition, Peter Graves (no relation to Leonard) has been added to provide more analysis in this set.I highly recommend this fine collection.

Lawrence,"[4, 4]","""Victory at Sea"" is a 1952 documentary based in some part on historian Samuel Elliot Morison's ""History of United States Naval Operations in World War Two."" It consists of 26 episodes of approximately a half hour, each. It was broadcast just seven years after VJ day.The contemporary audience may be put off by the hodgepodge of archival film, some of it from theatrical film, and all too often the snippet is not of the place being described. Modern film documentarians have tried to avoid this sort of gaff.But in my view, none of that ultimately matters.I showed part of Victory at Sea to a friend, a film maker, and my friend remarked -- ""it's a poem."" Some might disagree with that view, but it caused me to rethink why this series holds up after 60 years.I cannot disagree with many of the other reviewers who say the transfer is not as good as it should or could be. Yet, despite that, like other reviewers who have written here, I was hooked when I was young and the series was first broadcast on black and white TV with a tinny speaker. The series, as originally aired, did not have the modern technology, which we have come to expect.Richard Rogers' score is Wagnarian, mixed with his own Broadway sense of music, and it drives the episodes forward. The narrator's words stir as the music rises and the images, however much I might criticize their inaccuracy, touch the emotions. Indeed, I was transported into the emotion of battles, defeat, suffering, and the final victory.It may be dated. Its pictures may not be exactly right. The sound quality might not be modern. The film may have faded. But!

767323,A3GAHSKFONFZRR,B0000AQS3X,Liam H Dooley,"[10, 10]","This series that I was first introduced to some fifteen years ago was my initiation into the world of classical music.  If nothing else, the score by Richard Rodgers is brilliant, evocative, and on-subject.  If I have one regret it is that there are only two soundtracks (Victory at Sea and More Victory at Sea); clearly a third one could easily be made from the many hours of music (there is, however, a lot of repetition of the music during the 18 hrs of so of play - which is reasonable!).I might also add that these DVDs seem to be no-zoned, despite what the amazon.com specifications say.  That means it can play on any DVD player worldwide (if, for example, you want to remind your French neighbors who saved France 60 years ago).The audio is absolutely frustrating - but at least its the voice that is lower rather than the music.  In an ideal world, it would be re-recorded in surround sound; keeping Leonard Graves' hypnotic voice but updating the scratchy music soundtrack.IF this series has a fault, its that it leaves a lot of battles uncovered or blows over them.  First, it blows past msot of the land campaigns - not a criticism as I understand that this is Victory at SEA.  However you can't watch this series and know everything about WWII; the air and land campaigns were no less dramatic or decisive.  But some of the episodes in here, such as the Burmese campaign, seem rather unrelated to the sea.  Similarly, the fall of Germany has a lot of brilliant film of Germans surrendering - but it is on land.  I might have prefered footage of Uboats surfacing around the world and coming into port on or after 8 May to surrender.It also makes light of Japanese atrocities, such as the rape of Nanking, the Bataan death march, etc.  It does give you the impression, if you pay attention, that the war against the Japanese was more vicious than that against the Germans - a reality of history.One excellent feature of the series is that though it may blow over some critical battles, it focuses on some that are less well known.  The German raiders, the Soviet liberation of Sevastapol, and some of the Pacific battles are fascinating.It is also interesting to note that though the series was made in 1952, when the Cold War was rolling along at full speed with the foundations of Nato and the Warsaw Pact, there is no anti-soviet or anti-communist bias except for a reference to foreigners not being able to roam around in Minsk.Altogether, a well done series.

The narration by Leonard Graves and the music by Richard Rodgers are at the absolutey correct levels that they should be, just as in the original VHS series. The sound quality is excellent as is the video imagery. You get the lead-in theme song and the big ""V"" at the end of each episode, no overlapping segue as in the VHS tapes which eliminated the leadin/endings for all episodes on a given tape in the series.

I have VHS versions of some episodes, and they are much superior in both picture and sound quality. What happened? The editing/compilation of the DVD's is VERY poorly done, the intro to each segment (by Peter Graves) is much louder than the following program, so you constantly have to run the volume up and down ( and not just a little +/- 100% ). The resulting sound is muddy, with severe flutter and poor dynamic range ( film not kept tight on the sound drum during transfer ). The narration of the episodes is hard to hear, while the sound effects and music come blaring out at you - drowning out everything. The overall effect is about what you might expect of a high school kid's first attempt at making a home movie - and only a C- at that. There is no capability to play the entire disc, you must select each episode from the main menu, and then select &quot;play this episode&quot; again from the sub-menu, repeated seven times for each disc.

It is hard to imagine what the producers of the original series would think - this was one of the finest original programs ever shown on TV - and to have the DVD's be so crudely done - no attempt to clean up the picture, no effort put into making the sound anywhere close to even, some episodes are very loud ( even distorted ) and some you can hardly hear, the inconvienient playback features, and cheesy packaging all contribute to the worst transfer, poorest DVD watching experience I have ever come accross.

Nylund,"[9, 10]","Since 1952, when NBC television first aired ""Victory at Sea,"" the 26 half-hour programs have been repeatedly shown on television and finally released on home video.  Admittedly, the sound quality of the narration, music, and sound effects is typical of television in the early 1950s, but the visual impact of the actual wartime footage remains quite powerful.For those who want to enjoy a true high fidelity version of much of the music Richard Rodgers and Robert Russell Bennett produced, the RCA Victor albums (first released in the early 1960s) remain the best source.  It is known that Rodgers composed the melodies in a piano version, then turned it over to Bennett to arrange and orchestrate.  The albums take the 13 hours of music, which repeated themes, and present them in a cohesive and concise version.  Bennett conducted the RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra, which was drawn from the Symphony of the Air, itself a reorganization of Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra.  Back in 1952, when the documentary was prepared, Bennett used the actual NBC Symphony, presumably with the blessings of the Maestro, who was a big fan of early television as well as Broadway musicals.The main focus in the 26 episodes is on the American Navy's involvement in World War II.  In editing millions of feet of archival footage, NBC assembled programs which captured not only the naval and aerial battles but the lighter moments when the sailors, pilots, and crew waited for the inevitable deadly combat to begin or resume.  The most important elements of the war are vividly represented here in sharp black and white.Yes, ""The World of War"" was probably more comprehensive and utilized some of the rare color footage of the war, but this was the first television documentary to chronicle the historic events, complete with glimpses of the famous and infamous leaders -- Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Tojo, and Stalin.  When you see the real figures, instead of actors portaying them, you recognize their unique and remarkable qualities.The visual images remain quite powerful on the videos.

This might be a drawback but, if it is, it is a mistake made in the original production, not in making the DVDs. Don't let those comments scare you away.Interesting bit of trivia: In the episode 'Roman Renaissance', the narrator throws out the term 'fortnight' in describing how long it took the allies to clear Naples harbor. Now how many Americans know today what a fortnight is? And yet in 1953, in a movie virtually made by the U. S. Navy, it was expected that all viewers would know. So there is a word that has disappeared from our vocabulary over the course of 50 years -- just another little episode in the drifting of American English away from the mother tongue.The most frequently used word in the narration is 'sacrifice' and, watching it, you can see why. This is the story of how much these men sacrificed so that we can be free and so that the world could be spared the darkness that had spread out like a cancer from the axis powers. Through the ages philosophers have frequently noted that, when in the presence of a man of real courage, a coward will often assume moral superiority as an easy way to console his ego. As I was watching this documentary, I could not help but feel pity for those who say that honoring these men is wrong because it glorifies war or excludes some demographic groups who were denied the opportunity to take part in combat. But I take comfort in knowing that honor is eternal -- it is not something that can be given or taken away. It is something that you earn through your actions. These men who sacrificed everything in that war have all honor and nothing that any pathetic, small-minded person says or does will ever detract from it in the slightest.",5,The Definitive Documentary,1187222400,"08 16, 2007",2007,1823,"['quality', 'disks', 'just', 'was', 'shown', 'TV', 'narrator', 'voice', 'drowned', 'out', 'music', 'often', 'might', 'be', 'drawback', 'mistake', 'made', 'original', 'production', 'not', 'making', 'DVDs', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'comments', 'scare', 'away.Interesting', 'bit', 'trivia', 'episode', 'Renaissance', 'narrator', 'out', 'term', ""'fortnight"", 'describing', 'how', 'long', 'took', 'allies', 'clear', 'Naples', 'harbor', 'Now', 'how', 'many', 'Americans', 'know', 'today', 'what', 'fortnight', 'yet', '1953', 'movie', 'virtually', 'made', 'U.', 'S.', 'Navy', 'was', 'expected', 'viewers', 'would', 'know', 'word', 'disappeared', 'vocabulary', 'course', '50', 'years', 'just', 'little', 'episode', 'drifting', 'American', 'English', 'away', 'mother', 'tongue.The', 'most', 'frequently', 'used', 'word', 'narration', ""'sacrifice"", 'watching', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'story', 'how', 'much', 'men', 'sacrificed', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'free', 'so', 'world', 'could', 'be', 'spared', 'darkness', 'had', 'spread', 'out', 'cancer', 'axis', 'powers', 'ages', 'philosophers', 'have', 'frequently', 'noted', 'when', 'presence', 'man', 'real', 'courage', 'coward', 'will', 'often', 'assume', 'moral', 'superiority', 'easy', 'way', 'console', 'ego', 'was', 'watching', 'documentary', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'pity', 'who', 'say', 'honoring', 'men', 'wrong', 'war', 'demographic', 'groups', 'who', 'were', 'denied', 'opportunity', 'take', 'part', 'combat', 'take', 'comfort', 'knowing', 'honor', 'eternal', 'not', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'given', 'taken', 'away', 'something', 'earn', 'actions', 'men', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'everything', 'war', 'have', 'honor', 'nothing', 'pathetic', 'small-minded', 'person', 'will', 'ever', 'detract', 'slightest']",N/A

767344,A3NPS7CH5NFRWG,B0000AQS3X,Terry Chance,"[12, 13]","Victory At Sea is an overview of several key strategies and battles of WWII. It is certainly not a complete history of WWII and does not pretend to be so. All of the episodes are somehow linked to the oceans and seas of the world, hence the name of the series.Even the episodes that are covered are not done in detail. With only 26 minutes per episode (and most of that actual footage), there is usually just an overview of the battle with the general synopsis and the outcome discussed.With those issues in mind, this is a good series. If a person is a student of WWII and is looking for detailed descriptions of battles, strategies, propoganda, etc., look elsewhere. If however, you want a nicely packaged quick peak at many different important battles and campaigns, you would do well to see this series. What it lacks in detail, it makes up for in just the fun of watching. I have seen many documentaries and read dozens of books on WWII. Victory At Sea added nothing to my knowledge of the subject. Even with that, it was just a fun series to watch. Maybe it is the simplicity of it that makes up for the short versions. Obviously it is slanted toward the Allies but look at the title, the Axis did not win the war. If the series was from their point of view, it would be titled Defeat At Sea.Much has been made of the quality of this version. I have only seen the full version on cable and not had the VHS or A&E; versions. I can surmise by the responses here that this version is somewhat lacking in quality compared to the others available... but at what price? How can you compare a $60 version that is remastered with a $10 version that is not. I actually got this version for $5.50.In my mind, the issue is quality vs value. I have viewed this series once from start to finish. I might view it again someday. For what I have used it for, this version certainly fills my needs. I saw the entire series and paid almost nothing for it. I am not really sure how good it can be anyway with the old technology that this version was taken from. How good can it be, even if being remastered and do you want to pay big bucks for something you will see once or twice? I watched the series for its content, not to be a music critic.Look at the other reviews. Almost no one is really complaining much about the series but of this cheap version. For my viewing purposes, this version fits my needs admirably. I got to relive the series that I have not seen in a long time and I could do it in short order instead of waiting for weeks on A&E; or the History Channel reruns. I would give this version 5 stars for value. Where can you get a 26 episode classic for $10 or less? I loved the series but it is a quick overview of lacking in detail, so I would give it 3 stars for content. All in all, well worth my small outlay of cash and I would recommend this series/version to anyone that likes classic documentaries of WWII.",3,Not bad for the price,1162944000,"11 8, 2006",2006,2920,"['Victory', 'Sea', 'overview', 'several', 'key', 'strategies', 'battles', 'WWII', 'certainly', 'not', 'complete', 'history', 'WWII', 'not', 'pretend', 'be', 'so', 'episodes', 'are', 'somehow', 'linked', 'oceans', 'seas', 'world', 'hence', 'name', 'series.Even', 'episodes', 'are', 'covered', 'are', 'not', 'done', 'detail', 'only', '26', 'minutes', 'episode', 'most', 'actual', 'footage', 'usually', 'just', 'overview', 'battle', 'general', 'synopsis', 'outcome', 'discussed.With', 'issues', 'mind', 'good', 'series', 'person', 'student', 'WWII', 'looking', 'detailed', 'descriptions', 'battles', 'strategies', 'propoganda', 'etc.', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'however', 'want', 'nicely', 'packaged', 'quick', 'peak', 'many', 'different', 'important', 'battles', 'campaigns', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'see', 'series', 'What', 'detail', 'up', 'just', 'fun', 'watching', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'documentaries', 'read', 'dozens', 'books', 'WWII', 'Victory', 'Sea', 'added', 'nothing', 'knowledge', 'subject', 'Even', 'was', 'just', 'fun', 'series', 'watch', 'Maybe', 'simplicity', 'up', 'short', 'versions', 'slanted', 'Allies', 'look', 'title', 'Axis', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'war', 'series', 'was', 'point', 'view', 'would', 'be', 'titled', 'Defeat', 'Sea.Much', 'been', 'made', 'quality', 'version', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'full', 'version', 'cable', 'not', 'had', 'VHS', 'A', 'E', 'versions', 'can', 'surmise', 'responses', 'here', 'version', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'quality', 'compared', 'others', 'available', 'what', 'price', 'How', 'can', 'compare', '60', 'version', 'remastered', '10', 'version', 'not', 'actually', 'got', 'version', '5.50.In', 'mind', 'issue', 'quality', 'value', 'have', 'viewed', 'series', 'once', 'start', 'finish', 'might', 'view', 'again', 'someday', 'what', 'have', 'used', 'version', 'certainly', 'needs', 'saw', 'entire', 'series', 'paid', 'almost', 'nothing', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'how', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'anyway', 'old', 'technology', 'version', 'was', 'taken', 'How', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'even', 'being', 'remastered', 'do', 'want', 'pay', 'big', 'bucks', 'something', 'will', 'see', 'once', 'twice', 'watched', 'series', 'content', 'not', 'be', 'music', 'critic.Look', 'other', 'reviews', 'Almost', 'one', 'really', 'complaining', 'much', 'series', 'cheap', 'version', 'viewing', 'purposes', 'version', 'needs', 'admirably', 'got', 'relive', 'series', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'could', 'do', 'short', 'order', 'instead', 'waiting', 'weeks', 'A', 'E', 'History', 'Channel', 'reruns', 'would', 'give', 'version', '5', 'stars', 'value', 'Where', 'can', 'get', '26', 'episode', 'classic', '10', 'less', 'loved', 'series', 'quick', 'overview', 'lacking', 'detail', 'would', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'content', 'well', 'small', 'outlay', 'cash', 'would', 'recommend', 'series/version', 'anyone', 'classic', 'documentaries', 'WWII']",N/A
