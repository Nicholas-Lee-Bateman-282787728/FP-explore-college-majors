The Doctors have some great moments with Pertwee and Troughton showing their contrasting styles. The story isn't the best and this is most felt in Episode 2 where Pertwee and Troughton are apart for the entire episode, but the stakes definitely work for a landmark show. The Brigadier was also written as a little dumb in some spots. Troughton puts on a great performance that would serve as inspiration for future multi-doctor stories. Overall, this was a lot of fun and a must for any fan of early Doctor Who.",4,Triple Your Pleasure,1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,648,"['was', 'truly', 'classic', 'story', 'Having', 'watched', 'plenty', 'Troughton', 'Pertwee', 'definitely', 'appreciated', 'team', 'up', 'must-see', 'Doctors', 'have', 'great', 'moments', 'Pertwee', 'Troughton', 'showing', 'contrasting', 'styles', 'story', ""n't"", 'best', 'most', 'felt', 'Episode', '2', 'where', 'Pertwee', 'Troughton', 'are', 'apart', 'entire', 'episode', 'stakes', 'definitely', 'work', 'landmark', 'show', 'Brigadier', 'was', 'also', 'written', 'little', 'dumb', 'spots', 'Troughton', 'great', 'performance', 'would', 'serve', 'inspiration', 'future', 'multi-doctor', 'stories', 'Overall', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'must', 'fan', 'early', 'Doctor', 'Who']",N/A

554880,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,B00004WG8C,Andrew McCaffrey,"[15, 19]","I like THE THREE DOCTORS, flawed though it is.  It's overall just rompy escapism, rather than the hard-edged drama we saw during Pertwee's first year, but at this season, that's mostly what we expect.  The serial gets a big boost from its cast.  Not just the other two Doctors, but Stephen Thorne who puts serious gravitas into his villainous Omega.  THE THREE DOCTORS isn't quite sure what it wants to be.  Omega's story feels almost gothic in substance, while the comic relief portions almost override everything else.  Mix that together with all the padding, and you're left with a bit of a mess, albeit a well-meaning, entertaining one.It's fitting that a story ending with the Doctor regaining his freedom is primarily concerned with a tragic figure attempting to grasp his own.  It's a shame Omega doesn't get a good chunk of screen-time until episode three; he's the best thing here.  The Time Lords' great power coming at the cost of one man's imprisonment and torment.  One man making a sacrifice, to set his people up above the very Gods.  That and his Catch-22 dilemma make for enthralling viewing.  Thorne plays it perfectly, giving Omega a dark, sad anger -- full of power and menace.  It's a pity that all this great storytelling comes in the middle of ""...that's Cromer out there..."" and the constantly belching Gel Guards.Troughton easily steals every scene he appears in.  (""This is a show Jon Pertwee stole from Pat Troughton.  He's stealin' it back."") Between accidentally breaking the Brigadier's radio and subtly probing the limits of Omega's self-control, he shows himself to be the ultimate Doctor -- always entertaining and always in command.  Points off for not showing us him briefing the UN Security Council...  That would have been a hoot!  William Hartnell is charming.  Fan of Hartnell's Doctor that I am, it's great to see him back for one final adventure.  Sadly, because of his health, it's more nostalgia that I feel rather than genuine enthusiasm, but he's still a lot of fun in his brief appearances.The script, which seems excited at the epic story of Omega's fall, feels oddly tired at other points.  Tedious and awkward are the scenes of the Time Lords watching the proceedings from their distant world.  The argument for allowing the Doctor meet his other selves boils down to ""I must!"" and counter arguments are dissuaded with ""On the contrary, blah blah blah, I must!""  Not exactly Socrates' Apology.  There's also some plot sloppiness.  For example, at the end of episode three, the Time Lords suddenly know a lot more then they did before, without explanation as to how.The science in this serial is, well, at least they tried to make it sound scientific.  But I think even the most scientific-illiterate would realize grass doesn't grow underneath buildings and black holes don't go around sucking in and farting out Mr. Holises...The rest of the script seems to consist of nothing but padding: corridor running (which Tyler even comments on being a waste of time), people being captured, and the never-ending farewell scene, which is undercut when they're reunited moments later (although Nick Courtney's performance in those minutes instantly forgives the mockery his character underwent in the rest of the serial).""This is a place.  Just like any other place,"" states Pertwee, looking around at a rock quarry, which indeed looks like every other place he visited.  For being the tenth anniversary special, outside of the guest stars the serial doesn't look very special.  The battle sequences in episode one aren't effectively directed.  This is a long way from AMBASSADORS OF DEATH's fight scenes.  The UNIT troops don't even bother taking cover; they just stand right out in the open.  Barry Letts rightly criticizes the sets on Omega's world for being too pantomime.  The cheaply made sets look exactly like cheaply made sets.  If only they could have shot Omega's throne room on location in some run-down castle...As for the DVD extras, I've not been a huge fan of some of the fluff that gets put on these discs, but I must admit to being tickled this time.  The Pebble Mill piece is hilarious.  The production notes are great, with a lot of focus on earlier script drafts/ideas (""Deathworld"" seems more interesting than what we got).  Even the commentary (often the weakest link on these DVDs) sparkles.  The best formula seems to be a mix of production crew and actors, and that heuristic is true again.  Katy Manning and Nicholas Courtney's anecdotes and clowning are amusing, and Barry Letts' dry comments are always informative.  But one thing: couldn't we have had Terrence Dicks on the commentary track too?Review Extras.  Things may which amuse only me, but I'm including anyway:1. Omega has great powers.  In his domain, everything is possible, because he can make things jump in and out of the frame like he's a student film director.2. Omega claims that the Doctors must eventually wear masks such as his.  A pity they never did that.  Can you imagine Troughton clowning with that big headdress on?  Comedy gold!3. Despite the fact that the anti-matter thing ate all of Mr. Hollis, only his screaming face appears on the photographic slide; presumably, this was the closest part of him to the cosmic-ray detector device.  Lucky for him it wasn't his butt that was closest.  They'd still be trying to identify it.4. The thought-transference stuff meant switching the camera quickly between shots of Pertwee and Troughton.  It goes so fast that it almost looks like subliminal advertising.  And I can tell you that after watching these scenes, I was strangely hungry for a giant nose.5. In all of Troughton's three post-WAR GAMES appearances, he's involved in a plot that has him running around yelping about Time Lords.  Given that they weren't even formally introduced until his final episode, this has always struck me as being slightly wrong somehow...",3,A dandy and a clown...,1083801600,"05 6,

554883,A11GO5VA74HD8K,B00004WG8C,Crazy Fox,"[4, 4]","""The Three Doctors"" is something of an ambivalent classic. On the one hand, to be honest, it is riddled with faults, and it kind of feels like the whole crew is coasting a bit in celebration of the show's ten year run (which is certainly worth celebrating, of course). The weeble-wobbly monsters look kind of like congealed jelly or rotten pinecones and amble about bumping into things at a snail's pace--more comical than threatening. The scientific background is ambitious but incredibly shaky, and the idea of a gust of steam being a singularity is unintentionally humorous (not to mention bizarre); the faulty conflation of black holes and antimatter also comes across as goofy (or constantly annoying, in my wife's case), though perhaps this was all so esoteric as to be effective technobabble in the early 1970's. The supporting cast at times seem to be walking through the script without really getting into it, while way too much pointless walking through corridors slows down the plot. And so on and so on, gripe gripe gripe.On the other hand, to be honest, it's replete with the stuff of greatness, and it rather feels like the crew went all out on this one. The idea of teaming up the current Doctor with his prior incarnations is an incredibly inventive inspiration (inspired from fan letters, we learn in the extras, but anyway), and works perfectly. It could've turned out so cheesy too, but the rivalry and bickering between the three of them gives it just the right chemistry (and is awfully amusing in the bargain). Patrick Troughton and Jon Pertwee both give this performance their all, and the way their Doctors' personalities clash and yet complement each other more than makes up for any gripey nitpicks. It's really too bad William Hartnell couldn't participate more due to his health, but the old boy is doing his level best and hats off to him--since from the start he believed in the show's long-lasting potential when everyone else gave it a season or two at best, there's a certain poetic justice in his being there for the 10th anniversary. To the naysayers, Ha!Three Doctors against one villain? Ordinarily this would be overkill, but Omega is as formidable and threatening as his jello minions are not. Here's one of those great villains whose anger and resentment seem justified or at least understandable even if their resulting actions must be prevented. A Time Lord from Gallifrey like the Doctor, Omega developed the technology of time travel and in the process was trapped (abandoned, from his point of view) in an antimatter limbo. Now he has the power of a god and the emotional instability of a madman; there is something grand and awesome/aweful about his character, like Satan out of Milton's ""Paradise Lost"" or Darth Vader from the original ""Star Wars"" (whose mask and outfit his resembles, retroactively speaking)--and yet the scene when he breaks down in a heartrending wail at the knowledge that he's wasted away to nothing but raw willpower, trapped in a world of his own making for eternity, is, well, heartrending. The actor who plays Omega nails this performance, too--his dialogue is full of the kinds of lines that, depending on the delivery, are either unbelievably hokey or unbelievably dramatic, and he keeps it firmly in the latter register 100% of the way. The ability to convincingly portray such a character and to fully get his range of emotions across while encumbered with a bulky mask and a caped outfit probably deserves some kind of serious award, too.So, while giving the nitpicks their just due, in the final accounting, 3 Doctors + 1 Unbalanced Demiurge = A Timelord Classic.",4,"""A hero?

554884,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00004WG8C,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[1, 1]","The first major anniversary celebration was a success.  Ten years for a TV show was quite a feat, with three actors in the lead role, each actor boosting the ratings and popularity of the show, and what better way to celebrate it by having all three Doctors appearing?The story?  A strange sort of stellar energy arrives on Earth, having the alarming habit of making people vanish, such as Mr. Ollis, a game warden, and Professor Tyler, who is studying the energy.  It ends up that the energy is hunting the Doctor, as evidenced by the kidnapping of Bessie, the Doctor's yellow Roadster.  Well, the energy steals a lot more than that as the show progresses.The bigger picture, however, is grim.  The energy is coming from a black hole in the universe of anti-matter, and even the Time Lords are powerless to stop it.  The Chancellor comes up with the brilliant idea of breaking the First Law of Time and having the Doctor help himself.  Back on Earth, the current Doctor is puzzled when he sees a familiar looking recorder materialize, promptly followed by its owner, namely his previous self.  The recorder later plays a crucial role in the story, by the way.The perpetrator turns out to be a Time Lord legend, Omega, who was presumed dead, but turned up in his world of anti-matter.  However, his eons of solitude has left him thirsting for revenge against the Time Lords, whom he thinks betrayed and abandoned him, and nothing would be better than draining them of their power completely.Jo has a nice outfit in this story, miniskirt, boots, and a bluish fur coat (false fur, I hope).  Jon Pertwee teased Katy Manning on her outfit, remarking that he didn't remember this story having a blue Yeti.  Okay, so it isn't a sensible thing to wear on an alien planet, but part of what makes Jo my favorite companion are those her 60's-70's costumes.The interplay between Pertwee and Troughton is what keeps this story afloat.  They argue like little kids throughout the story, and it takes the stern and sensible First Doctor as well as Jo to keep them working together.The part where the Second and Third Doctors try to explain who he is to a very confused Jo leads her to misquote &quot;I Am The Walrus.&quot;  The exasperated Third Doctor says, &quot;Look Jo, it's perfectly simple.  I am he, and he is me.&quot;  Poor Jo chimes in with &quot;And we are all together.  Googoo gichoo.&quot;  Third Doctor:  &quot;What?&quot;  Jo:  &quot;It's a song by the Beatles.&quot;  Second Doctor:  &quot;Really?  How does it go?  Maybe I can play it on my recorder.&quot;The Brigadier and Sgt. Benton are the only human links to the show's past.  Both worked with the Second Doctor in The Invasion, and the show's continuity only adds to the effectiveness of the celebration.Stephen Thorne, whose booming voice is familiar as Azal in The Daemons and who later was the male Eldrad in The Hand Of Death, plays Omega here.  He is anguished when he removes his golden KKK-like mask to reveal... nothing.

That basically sums up the situation in this Doctor Who adventure.As most of your readers will know by now, the BBC, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the show decided to reunite all of the actors who had played the lead role since the show's inception. Alas, the first Doctor William Hartnell, was stricken by a long and debilitating illness and was unable to play much of a part in the proceedings but to his eternal credit he did participate and made a memorable contribution showing just why he was chosen as the Doctor in the first instance.Although the story introduced a number of elements of Timelord / Gallifrey mythology which added to the plot the main concern was the interplay between the three Doctor Whos. The villain, a larger than life nothing as it turned out pre-empts another Galliferyian renegade in the Brain of Morbius. Here his main job was to provide an opponent who was much stronger than the Doctor.The combination of the three Doctors together is a masterstroke. Despite being debilitated by his illness, William Hartnell produced a marvellous performance although limited to brief sequences. The use of modern television techniques as well as colour helped to illuminate his Doctor as never before, brining in to question the whole idea of what Doctor Who would have been like had it been introduced in the 1970s.Despite that level of performance, for me the characters of the second and third Doctors interacting together was the highlight of the adventure. Patrick Troughton endeared himself to many with his pouting and sulking in reaction to Jon Pertwee being arrogant and condescending. Not only did they bring out the worst but also the best in each other.Mention should also be made of the supporting cast who were often relegated to minor positions. The long suffering Brigadier, clearly at a loss with the Doctor to begin with was all at sea with two.This was truly a fitting testament to everyone involved in Doctor Who and must be considered to be one of the classics of the show.",4,Everything comes in threes.,1034121600,"10 9, 2002",2002,2077,"['When', 'want', 'opinion', 'will', 'give', 'one', 'basically', 'up', 'situation', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'most', 'readers', 'will', 'know', 'now', 'BBC', 'celebrate', 'tenth', 'anniversary', 'show', 'decided', 'reunite', 'actors', 'who', 'had', 'played', 'lead', 'role', 'show', 'inception', 'Alas', 'first', 'Doctor', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'was', 'stricken', 'long', 'debilitating', 'illness', 'was', 'unable', 'play', 'much', 'part', 'proceedings', 'eternal', 'credit', 'did', 'participate', 'made', 'memorable', 'contribution', 'showing', 'just', 'why', 'was', 'chosen', 'Doctor', 'first', 'story', 'introduced', 'number', 'elements', 'Timelord', '/', 'Gallifrey', 'mythology', 'added', 'plot', 'main', 'concern', 'was', 'interplay', 'three', 'Doctor', 'Whos', 'villain', 'larger', 'life', 'nothing', 'turned', 'out', 'pre-empts', 'Galliferyian', 'renegade', 'Brain', 'Morbius', 'Here', 'main', 'job', 'was', 'provide', 'opponent', 'who', 'was', 'much', 'stronger', 'Doctor.The', 'combination', 'three', 'Doctors', 'together', 'masterstroke', 'being', 'debilitated', 'illness', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'produced', 'marvellous', 'performance', 'limited', 'brief', 'sequences', 'use', 'modern', 'television', 'techniques', 'as', 'well', 'colour', 'helped', 'illuminate', 'Doctor', 'never', 'brining', 'question', 'whole', 'idea', 'what', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'been', 'introduced', '1970s.Despite', 'level', 'performance', 'characters', 'second', 'third', 'Doctors', 'interacting', 'together', 'was', 'highlight', 'adventure', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'endeared', 'many', 'pouting', 'sulking', 'reaction', 'Jon', 'Pertwee', 'being', 'arrogant', 'condescending', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'bring', 'out', 'worst', 'also', 'best', 'other.Mention', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'supporting', 'cast', 'who', 'were', 'often', 'relegated', 'minor', 'positions', 'long', 'suffering', 'Brigadier', 'clearly', 'loss', 'Doctor', 'begin', 'was', 'sea', 'two.This', 'was', 'truly', 'fitting', 'testament', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'must', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'classics', 'show']",N/A

Trumpolt ""Scott Trumpolt""","[1, 1]","There haven't been too many attempts at bringing together more than One Doctor at a time in the Series but in this case, the first attempt in ""The Three Doctors"" remains the best.  Rather than a ""slap it together"" story such as the ""The Five Doctors"" where one doctor (Tom Baker) doesn't really participate except via stock footage and another is a fill-in (for long dead First Doctor William Hartnell) this one has a pretty cohesive and enjoyable story.Primarily focused on the returning Patrick Troughton and the then current Doctor, Jon Pertwee, these two share equal screen time and play antagonistically off each other very well indeed!  William Hartnell, ailing at the time, appears in only a few segments via a video link up type situation but he does get in a few good lines at the expense of his two replacements.  As was typical of the Jon Pertwee Period, UNIT is integral to the story in defending Earth against Anti-Matter based creatures that look like over-sized Christmas Ornaments that are under the control of a Renegade Time Lord seeking his release from his own anti-matter existence.Speaking of the Time Lords themselves, they are responsible for bringing together the three doctors by crossing their time streams.  They use the technique in this case because they are combating power drains to their own planet caused from a black hole in space. This part of the story is the reason why I cannot give it five Stars due to the atrocious acting of the timelords played by various nondescript actors.  In addition, there is a sometimes muddled connection between how the events unfolding on Earth are connected to what is happening with the Time Lords own grave situation.Ultimately, there is a big showdown on the Anti-Matter Planet between the Doctors and the Renegade Timelord along with the Doctor's Companion (Katy Manning) and Intrepid UNIT Head Lethbridge Stewart (Nicholas Courtney)along for the ride...  I will leave the ending to your good imagination until you see if for yourself.All in all though, an entertaining Four Part Serial from 1972-1973 that you will pull out from time to time and enjoy!",4,The Only Credible Multi-Doctor Effort!,1355616000,"12 16, 2012",2012,2128,"['have', ""n't"", 'been', 'too', 'many', 'attempts', 'bringing', 'together', 'more', 'One', 'Doctor', 'time', 'Series', 'case', 'first', 'attempt', 'Three', 'Doctors', 'best', 'Rather', 'slap', 'together', 'story', 'such', 'Five', 'Doctors', 'where', 'one', 'doctor', 'Tom', 'Baker', ""n't"", 'really', 'participate', 'stock', 'footage', 'fill-in', 'long', 'dead', 'First', 'Doctor', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'one', 'pretty', 'cohesive', 'enjoyable', 'story.Primarily', 'focused', 'returning', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'then', 'current', 'Doctor', 'Jon', 'Pertwee', 'two', 'share', 'equal', 'screen', 'time', 'play', 'antagonistically', 'other', 'very', 'well', 'indeed', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'ailing', 'time', 'only', 'few', 'segments', 'video', 'link', 'type', 'situation', 'get', 'few', 'good', 'lines', 'expense', 'two', 'replacements', 'was', 'typical', 'Jon', 'Pertwee', 'Period', 'UNIT', 'integral', 'story', 'defending', 'Earth', 'Anti-Matter', 'based', 'creatures', 'look', 'over-sized', 'Christmas', 'Ornaments', 'are', 'control', 'Renegade', 'Time', 'Lord', 'seeking', 'release', 'own', 'anti-matter', 'existence.Speaking', 'Time', 'Lords', 'are', 'responsible', 'bringing', 'together', 'three', 'doctors', 'crossing', 'time', 'streams', 'use', 'technique', 'case', 'are', 'combating', 'power', 'drains', 'own', 'planet', 'caused', 'black', 'hole', 'space', 'part', 'story', 'reason', 'why', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'five', 'Stars', 'due', 'atrocious', 'acting', 'timelords', 'played', 'various', 'nondescript', 'actors', 'addition', 'sometimes', 'muddled', 'connection', 'how', 'events', 'unfolding', 'Earth', 'are', 'connected', 'what', 'happening', 'Time', 'Lords', 'own', 'grave', 'situation.Ultimately', 'big', 'showdown', 'Anti-Matter', 'Planet', 'Doctors', 'Renegade', 'Timelord', 'Doctor', 'Companion', 'Katy', 'Manning', 'Intrepid', 'UNIT', 'Head', 'Lethbridge', 'Stewart', 'Nicholas', 'Courtney', 'ride', 'will', 'leave', 'ending', 'good', 'imagination', 'see', 'yourself.All', 'entertaining', 'Four', 'Part', 'Serial', '1972-1973', 'will', 'pull', 'out', 'time', 'time', 'enjoy']",N/A
554900,A306Z6Q4YV0DDC,B00004WG8C,"Robert Torres ""Bobby Shaddoe""","[0, 0]","This adventure marked a great deal of significance for Doctor Who in many ways.  This adventure marked the 10th Anniversary of the program, and also brought together Jon Pertwee with Patrick Troughton and William Hartnell, the two previous actors to portray the Doctor.The adventure itself was extraordinary, as it involves Omega, one of the founders of the Time Lord society, living in a universe of Anti-Matter that lies within the confines of a black hole, driven mad by the long years of isolation, out for revenge against the Time Lords (believing that he was abandoned).  His powers are so great that the time bridge he creates (a frightening blob of ooze) threatens to tear apart the very fabric of the space-time continuum.  In order to put a stop to it, the Time Lords break the first rule of time and allow the Doctor to help himself... literally.  by removing his previous selves from their timestreams temporarily to assist the present incarnation.This was a delightful adventure indeed.  Upon seeing Patrick Troughton reappear out of midair to retrieve his recorder from the hands of the Third Doctor is simply priceless, and their bickering was also a highlight.  And also of great importance was the appearance of William Hartnell.  Although he was suffering from an illness that prevented him from being there on the set, he did provide a great deal through brief pre-recorded segments that would appear on the time scanner.  My favorite part was when the two Doctors see the first Doctor on the screen, and Jo asks them both who that was, to which they both simultaneously reply, Me!  then look at each in anger and say again in unison, ME!this truly is a classic and a must have for Doctor Who fans, for at the end, the adventure also marks the end of the Doctor's exile.  get a copy of this and you'll see what I mean.",5,Three truly is the magic number!,1053993600,"05 27, 2003",2003,1837,"['adventure', 'marked', 'great', 'deal', 'significance', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'many', 'ways', 'adventure', 'marked', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'program', 'also', 'brought', 'together', 'Jon', 'Pertwee', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'two', 'previous', 'actors', 'portray', 'Doctor.The', 'adventure', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'Omega', 'one', 'founders', 'Time', 'Lord', 'society', 'living', 'universe', 'Anti-Matter', 'confines', 'black', 'hole', 'driven', 'mad', 'long', 'years', 'isolation', 'revenge', 'Time', 'Lords', 'believing', 'was', 'abandoned', 'powers', 'are', 'so', 'great', 'time', 'bridge', 'frightening', 'blob', 'ooze', 'tear', 'apart', 'very', 'fabric', 'space-time', 'continuum', 'order', 'put', 'stop', 'Time', 'Lords', 'break', 'first', 'rule', 'time', 'allow', 'Doctor', 'help', 'literally', 'removing', 'previous', 'selves', 'timestreams', 'temporarily', 'assist', 'present', 'incarnation.This', 'was', 'delightful', 'adventure', 'indeed', 'seeing', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'reappear', 'midair', 'retrieve', 'recorder', 'hands', 'Third', 'Doctor', 'simply', 'priceless', 'bickering', 'was', 'also', 'highlight', 'also', 'great', 'importance', 'was', 'appearance', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'was', 'suffering', 'illness', 'prevented', 'being', 'set', 'did', 'provide', 'great', 'deal', 'brief', 'pre-recorded', 'segments', 'would', 'appear', 'time', 'scanner', 'favorite', 'part', 'was', 'when', 'two', 'Doctors', 'see', 'first', 'Doctor', 'screen', 'Jo', 'who', 'was', 'simultaneously', 'reply', 'Me', 'then', 'look', 'anger', 'say', 'again', 'unison', 'ME', 'truly', 'classic', 'must', 'have', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'end', 'adventure', 'also', 'end', 'Doctor', 'exile', 'get', 'copy', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean']",N/A
554901,A36SZ95UZYWP55,B00004WG8C,Rogue Dragon,"[1, 1]","The Three Doctors was a 10 year reunion show of sorts, Unfortunatly it suffers from a couple of probloms, William Hartnell was too ill to do more then feed lines to a moniter in the Tardis, his semi there semi not there state is similer to Tom Baker's absence in the 20th anniversry, The Five Doctors and leaves you wondering if it would have been better to simply not include him at all, though at the end of the day I'm sure that most all would agree that it was good to see him one last time. Fortunatly Patrick Troughton makes it alot easier to forget about the missing Doctor and the best part of the show is undoubtly watching him and Jon Pertwee try to steal the show from one another. Omeaga is not the most frighting of villians but fortuantly he's not the worse either though his blob like minions are about as scary as the ant's in ""The Web Planet"". The other problom comes in with both the aniversery shows, to many charecters and not enough to do. With effectively 2 Doctors and 3 companions and another doctor (no not the original just a plain old doctor of science) and a hunter along for the ride the show easily feels crowded. To often the only thing for everyone to do is stand behind Jon and Pat while they figure everthing out by themselves.
