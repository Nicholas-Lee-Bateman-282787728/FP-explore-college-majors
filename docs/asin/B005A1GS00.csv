1451833,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B005A1GS00,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[2, 3]","Two years on from Series 4 Doc Martin has returned to our screens and this series was well worth the wait. Formerly a highly successful surgeon who has developed a phobia for performing operations and in particular to the sight of blood, Doctor Martin Ellingham has started a new life as a GP in the quiet Cornish village of Port Wenn in the UK. However, having absolutely zero people skills and a nonexistent bedside manner, traits which extend to his personal life and in particular his relationship with his former partner, the long suffering Louisa, his dealings with the locals are somewhat uneasy.The last series ended with Doc Martin wondering whether to move back to London, or stay in Port Wenn to support Louisa who has just given birth to their child. However, Doc Martin is less than impressed with his replacement as GP, and predictably decides to stay on. Quite a number of the plots this time round feature the rather haphazard child minding arrangements for the baby, and at one stage this is subcontracted out by Louisa's mother to some teenage girls at the bargain price of 2 (about $3) an hour! The climax to this series again revolves around the baby, but we do not have a cliffhanger ending this time round which I was grateful for as this always seems somewhat contrived.Port Wenn is a quiet, country village and nothing of great significance seems to happen for a lot of the time. When something out of the ordinary does happen, it is played out to the full. For example, one episode is based on Bert Large, the restaurateur, borrowing 1,000 ($1500) from a wheelchair bound loan shark and his dim son, and being concerned about unspecified `repercussions' in the event of non repayment. However, much of the charm of this show lies in the gently eccentric characters who abound in Port Wenn. This time particular mention should be made of Morwenna, the Doc's new and somewhat scatty young receptionist who clearly does her best - Bless! Louisa's mother, who has rather eccentric views on keeping babies quiet and the rather stoic Aunt Ruth are also strong characters worthy of mention.Yet again Martin Clunes excels as Doc Martin, playing the part with a largely expressionless face except for the odd twinge of exasperation or irritation which occasionally crosses his brow. He has made this part his own and you really cannot imagine anyone else as Doc Martin. There seems to be some doubt as to whether there will be a sixth series and certainly there has been no announcement so far. I think it will be a real shame if we have to make do with the 37 episodes to date, 8 of them from the latest series, as I would think this show has the potential to run and run.",5,Lets Hope this is not the End of Doc Martin,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,2689,"['Two', 'years', 'Series', '4', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'returned', 'screens', 'series', 'was', 'well', 'wait', 'Formerly', 'highly', 'successful', 'surgeon', 'who', 'developed', 'phobia', 'performing', 'operations', 'particular', 'sight', 'blood', 'Doctor', 'Martin', 'Ellingham', 'started', 'new', 'life', 'GP', 'quiet', 'Cornish', 'village', 'Port', 'Wenn', 'UK', 'However', 'having', 'absolutely', 'zero', 'people', 'skills', 'nonexistent', 'bedside', 'manner', 'traits', 'extend', 'personal', 'life', 'particular', 'relationship', 'former', 'partner', 'long', 'suffering', 'Louisa', 'dealings', 'locals', 'are', 'somewhat', 'uneasy.The', 'last', 'series', 'ended', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'wondering', 'move', 'back', 'London', 'stay', 'Port', 'Wenn', 'support', 'Louisa', 'who', 'just', 'given', 'birth', 'child', 'However', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'less', 'impressed', 'replacement', 'GP', 'predictably', 'stay', 'number', 'plots', 'time', 'round', 'feature', 'rather', 'haphazard', 'child', 'minding', 'arrangements', 'baby', 'one', 'stage', 'subcontracted', 'out', 'Louisa', 'mother', 'teenage', 'girls', 'bargain', 'price', '2', '3', 'hour', 'climax', 'series', 'again', 'baby', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'time', 'round', 'was', 'grateful', 'always', 'somewhat', 'contrived.Port', 'Wenn', 'quiet', 'country', 'village', 'nothing', 'great', 'significance', 'happen', 'lot', 'time', 'When', 'something', 'ordinary', 'happen', 'played', 'out', 'full', 'example', 'one', 'episode', 'based', 'Bert', 'Large', 'restaurateur', 'borrowing', '1,000', '1500', 'wheelchair', 'bound', 'loan', 'shark', 'dim', 'son', 'being', 'concerned', 'unspecified', 'repercussions', 'event', 'non', 'repayment', 'However', 'much', 'charm', 'show', 'gently', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'who', 'abound', 'Port', 'Wenn', 'time', 'particular', 'mention', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'Morwenna', 'Doc', 'new', 'somewhat', 'scatty', 'young', 'receptionist', 'who', 'clearly', 'best', 'Bless', 'Louisa', 'mother', 'who', 'rather', 'eccentric', 'views', 'keeping', 'babies', 'quiet', 'rather', 'stoic', 'Aunt', 'Ruth', 'are', 'also', 'strong', 'characters', 'mention.Yet', 'again', 'Martin', 'Clunes', 'excels', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'playing', 'part', 'largely', 'expressionless', 'face', 'odd', 'twinge', 'exasperation', 'irritation', 'occasionally', 'brow', 'made', 'part', 'own', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'be', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'sixth', 'series', 'certainly', 'been', 'announcement', 'so', 'far', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'real', 'shame', 'have', 'make', 'do', '37', 'episodes', 'date', '8', 'latest', 'series', 'would', 'think', 'show', 'potential', 'run', 'run']",N/A

Rexford,"[35, 50]","(EDITED FOR CLARITY)This review is of series 5 of Dr. Martin, not the DVD release.Dr. Martin began as a friendly and charming little series with top-notch acting and writing that warmed and amused. The character of Dr. Martin was one of intelligent routine bounded on all sides by the unconventional and spontaneous members of the beautifully serene surroundings of Port Wen. His efforts to fit in with the less conservative folks that frequented his day-to-day general practice belied the warmth he had for the area, and for one lady in particular, the comparatively sane and lovely Louisa...I began to notice rot in the wood while watching season 3, but season 4 h ad me worried....as for season 5 (so far), it is as if I am meeting an old friend who has been spoiled by life and has changed so much that I find him unfamiliar and unlikeable.(Spoiler Alert)Louisa and the Doctor have no spark between them. Louisa seems to have all but lost her sensible capacity to handle a baby, and Martin, who once seemed to value common sense and practicality, now serves only to parody his former self with an obvious pander to comedic expressions and behaviors that cry out 'laugh at me' but only become less amusing for their deliberate attempts to force comedy. Their handling of Auntie's funeral is a clear example of this shallow, sight-gag comedy that has replaced the subtle humor which so swept us into the engaging lives of Port Wen. What I have found lacking, is respect for the characters that once graced the screen with amusing and unpredictable charms. Now, that respect is swapped out for simple-minded buffoonery and gags that shout for attention, thus encouraging none.I will watch for improvement, but I have little hope. I am angry that the producers would allow such a misuse of talent and ideas...that they drew me into this series just to find, not heart at its core, but a bad, bad joke.EDIT: I have now seen all of the episodes of this season, and I am sorry to say I have not changed my view of series 5. The focus of series 5 seems to continue to be farce and sight-gags rather than charming quirks and character story lines. The last episode was such an embarrassment that I simply cannot justify one single minute of its writing. Not one single minute. The first season wrapped me in warmth and charm, the last season left me cold and betrayed.I upped this from an original one star since I do not actually 'Hate' the series. What keeps me from hating series 5 is the utterly adorable baby, the tranquil, beautiful surroundings, and Martin's other aunt, who turned out to be the only watchable character in the show...until the last episode which spared nobody from its shame.",2,The Doctor is Not 'In',1334016000,"04 10, 2012",2012,2695,"['EDITED', 'FOR', 'CLARITY', 'review', 'series', '5', 'Dr.', 'Martin', 'not', 'DVD', 'release.Dr', 'Martin', 'began', 'friendly', 'charming', 'little', 'series', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'writing', 'warmed', 'amused', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Martin', 'was', 'one', 'intelligent', 'routine', 'bounded', 'sides', 'unconventional', 'spontaneous', 'members', 'beautifully', 'serene', 'surroundings', 'Port', 'Wen', 'efforts', 'fit', 'less', 'conservative', 'folks', 'frequented', 'day-to-day', 'general', 'practice', 'belied', 'warmth', 'had', 'area', 'one', 'lady', 'particular', 'comparatively', 'sane', 'lovely', 'Louisa', 'began', 'notice', 'rot', 'wood', 'watching', 'season', '3', 'season', '4', 'h', 'ad', 'worried', '.as', 'season', '5', 'so', 'far', 'am', 'meeting', 'old', 'friend', 'who', 'been', 'spoiled', 'life', 'changed', 'so', 'much', 'find', 'unfamiliar', 'unlikeable', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', 'Louisa', 'Doctor', 'have', 'spark', 'Louisa', 'have', 'lost', 'sensible', 'capacity', 'handle', 'baby', 'Martin', 'who', 'once', 'seemed', 'value', 'common', 'sense', 'practicality', 'now', 'only', 'parody', 'former', 'self', 'obvious', 'pander', 'comedic', 'expressions', 'behaviors', 'cry', 'out', ""'laugh"", 'only', 'become', 'less', 'amusing', 'deliberate', 'attempts', 'force', 'comedy', 'handling', 'Auntie', 'funeral', 'clear', 'example', 'shallow', 'sight-gag', 'comedy', 'replaced', 'subtle', 'humor', 'so', 'swept', 'engaging', 'lives', 'Port', 'Wen', 'What', 'have', 'found', 'lacking', 'respect', 'characters', 'once', 'graced', 'screen', 'amusing', 'unpredictable', 'charms', 'Now', 'respect', 'swapped', 'out', 'simple-minded', 'buffoonery', 'gags', 'shout', 'attention', 'thus', 'encouraging', 'none.I', 'will', 'watch', 'improvement', 'have', 'little', 'hope', 'am', 'angry', 'producers', 'would', 'allow', 'misuse', 'talent', 'ideas', 'drew', 'series', 'just', 'find', 'not', 'heart', 'core', 'bad', 'bad', 'joke.EDIT', 'have', 'now', 'seen', 'episodes', 'season', 'am', 'sorry', 'say', 'have', 'not', 'changed', 'view', 'series', '5', 'focus', 'series', '5', 'continue', 'be', 'farce', 'sight-gags', 'rather', 'charming', 'quirks', 'character', 'story', 'lines', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'such', 'embarrassment', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'justify', 'one', 'single', 'minute', 'writing', 'Not', 'one', 'single', 'minute', 'first', 'season', 'wrapped', 'warmth', 'charm', 'last', 'season', 'left', 'cold', 'betrayed.I', 'upped', 'original', 'one', 'star', 'do', 'not', 'actually', ""'Hate"", 'series', 'What', 'hating', 'series', '5', 'utterly', 'adorable', 'baby', 'tranquil', 'beautiful', 'surroundings', 'Martin', 'other', 'aunt', 'who', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'only', 'watchable', 'character', 'show', 'last', 'episode', 'spared', 'nobody', 'shame']",N/A

It took me about two episodes (at most) to fall in love with Portwenn (great scenery, by the way) and all the characters. The writing is superb, and the weaving in of various subplots in each episode, as well as a variety of story lines that continue from one episode to the next, is truly a work of genius. But best of all is the acting, particularly by Martin Clunes (Doc Martin) and Caroline Catz (Louisa Glassen).Each series gets better than the previous one. By the time we get to Series 5, Doc Martin has overcome his hemophobia, has delayed his return to practicing in London, and we sense that his return to becoming a practicing surgeon (rather than a GP) will be put on hold indefinitely. Moreover, although the Doc is still socially clueless, occasionally (though only very occasionally) a tender side of his personality shines through, particularly when he is with Louisa or with his Aunt Ruth, who has taken over the farm that belonged to his now-deceased Aunt Joan. There are some great moments of comic relief in this series, particularly when Bert Large confronts the loan sharks from whom he has borrowed 1,000 pounds, and also when the pharmacist develops a crush on the Doc.Like the first four Series, season five is definitely worth watching.",5,Can't say enough good,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,1321,"['When', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'was', 'skeptical', 'took', 'two', 'episodes', 'most', 'fall', 'love', 'Portwenn', 'great', 'scenery', 'way', 'characters', 'writing', 'superb', 'weaving', 'various', 'subplots', 'episode', 'as', 'well', 'variety', 'story', 'lines', 'continue', 'one', 'episode', 'next', 'truly', 'work', 'genius', 'best', 'acting', 'particularly', 'Martin', 'Clunes', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'Caroline', 'Catz', 'Louisa', 'Glassen', '.Each', 'series', 'better', 'previous', 'one', 'time', 'get', 'Series', '5', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'overcome', 'hemophobia', 'delayed', 'return', 'practicing', 'London', 'sense', 'return', 'becoming', 'practicing', 'surgeon', 'rather', 'GP', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'hold', 'indefinitely', 'Moreover', 'Doc', 'still', 'socially', 'clueless', 'occasionally', 'only', 'very', 'occasionally', 'tender', 'side', 'personality', 'shines', 'particularly', 'when', 'Louisa', 'Aunt', 'Ruth', 'who', 'taken', 'over', 'farm', 'belonged', 'now-deceased', 'Aunt', 'Joan', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'comic', 'relief', 'series', 'particularly', 'when', 'Bert', 'Large', 'loan', 'sharks', 'whom', 'borrowed', '1,000', 'pounds', 'also', 'when', 'pharmacist', 'crush', 'Doc.Like', 'first', 'four', 'Series', 'season', 'five', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

Morwenna (Jessica Ransom), is new office help, but can she handle it? Bert's dizzy. Aunt Ruth robbed. Gramps Newcross (Peter Vaughn) saved. Dunwick's are odd--imagine that at Portwenn. Doc confuses patient names.4:  Mother Knows BestA  charity turns calamity. Bert Large restaurant dukes it out with a pub. Ma Eleanor (Louise Jameson-newie), surprise!, at least a baby  sitter, surprise!, not good.5:  Remember MePC Penhale (John Marquez is back, yeah) surprised by an ex (Julie Graham). A Large quarrel.

1451927,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B005A1GS00,Jon Wynne,"[0, 0]","I love DOC MARTIN. I think Martin Clunes is brilliant. The Cornwall scenery is stunning and the world-wide following of the series is well-deserved.I also think the show peaked at the end of Series 4. But when something is this entertaining, why be picky?The reality is, the centre of DOC MARTIN is Martin and his relationship with Louisa (the wonderful Caroline Catz). The tension between the two is wonderful to watch, but how much longer can it go on? Now that there is a child in the mix, can they really stay at odds for another series? Of course we wait, with pleasure, for the ultimate payoff, some indication that Martin is finally able to acknowledge his social ineptness and profess his enduring love to Louisa. This is no secret and the show yearns for this semi-resolution with each series, never failing to deliver some quirky version of a conclusion.I suppose it&#8217;s a question of how many variations there are on this theme before the show becomes cloying. The supporting characters are all terrific, and even with the absence of Stephanie Cole as Martin&#8217;s aunt Joan (Cole left the show because she felt that four series of anything is enough&#8230;) there is sufficient colour and variety from the supporting players to give occasional respite to Martin and Louisa&#8217;s interpersonal angst.Then on the other hand, suppose you buy a large, family-sized chocolate bar. If you eat the whole thing at once, you&#8217;ll be sick of it. If, on the other hand, you ration it out, you&#8217;ll enjoy it afresh each time out. The latter seems to be the creative approach taken by the DOC MARTIN team. Their plan is to do a series every other year. I say more power to them, so long as they can find a way to keep things fresh and avoid recycled plots. For any long-term creative endeavour, this is the litmus test: can it continue to move forward? When significant financial gain connected to a show&#8217;s enormous popularity is a factor, this becomes even more tricky to achieve; the temptation to settle for second best in order to keep the cash cow on its feet can be difficult to resist. Far be it from me to question the artistic integrity of anyone associated with this outstanding series, but it is a potential factor.There are some welcome new characters in Series 5, most notably Martin&#8217;s aunt Ruth, played by the eminent Dame Eileen Atkins. Dame Atkins has been visible to TV audiences for over 50 years and her acting pedigree is exceptional. It takes a cast comprised of such luminaries to match Martin Clunes, who is one of the most versatile stars in England today. Every role he plays is different and after seeing him play virtually anything else, it is astonishing to see how believable he is as Doc Martin. Having said that, the younger talent on the show, including Jessica Ransom as the Doc&#8217;s new receptionist, Morwenna, hold their own with the best of them. In Ms. Ransom&#8217;s case, this includes appearing opposite acting legend Peter Vaughan.Fans of the show will love Series 5. There is much to enjoy, such as Bert Large&#8217;s continued restaurant travails; Aunt Ruth&#8217;s adjustment to the wilds of Cornwall; the well-intentioned interference of Louisa&#8217;s hippie mother; and the ongoing unrequited passion for Doc Martin by local chemist Mrs. Tichell. Add some lovely, inspired minor comic roles, such as a couple of newlyweds who have to deal with a nasty skin infection in the midst of their cleaving unto one another and you have inspired, witty, intelligent comedy-drama.While I do believe the show has peaked, I do not wish to imply that Series 5 is second-rate. Rather it is simply not the most creative adventures we&#8217;ve seen out of Doc Martin and friends. Still, the show is fun, entertaining and, in the words of another reviewer &#8220;completely addictive&#8221;. Just try to NOT watch all eight episodes within a matter of a few days. Betcha can&#8217;t!Take your year off, Doc. We&#8217;ll see you next time. And thanks to Acorn Media for not making us wait too long between the British broadcast of the episodes and the North American DVD release. Much appreciated.",4,Still has legs.,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,4156,"['love', 'DOC', 'MARTIN', 'think', 'Martin', 'Clunes', 'brilliant', 'Cornwall', 'scenery', 'stunning', 'world-wide', 'following', 'series', 'well-deserved.I', 'also', 'think', 'show', 'peaked', 'end', 'Series', '4', 'when', 'something', 'entertaining', 'why', 'be', 'picky', 'reality', 'centre', 'DOC', 'MARTIN', 'Martin', 'relationship', 'Louisa', 'wonderful', 'Caroline', 'Catz', 'tension', 'two', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'how', 'much', 'longer', 'can', 'go', 'Now', 'child', 'mix', 'can', 'really', 'stay', 'odds', 'series', 'course', 'wait', 'pleasure', 'ultimate', 'payoff', 'indication', 'Martin', 'finally', 'able', 'acknowledge', 'social', 'ineptness', 'profess', 'enduring', 'love', 'Louisa', 'secret', 'show', 'semi-resolution', 'series', 'never', 'failing', 'deliver', 'quirky', 'version', 'conclusion.I', 'suppose', '8217', 's', 'question', 'how', 'many', 'variations', 'are', 'theme', 'show', 'cloying', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'terrific', 'even', 'absence', 'Stephanie', 'Cole', 'Martin', '8217', 'aunt', 'Joan', 'Cole', 'left', 'show', 'felt', 'four', 'series', 'anything', 'enough', '8230', 'sufficient', 'colour', 'variety', 'supporting', 'players', 'give', 'occasional', 'respite', 'Martin', 'Louisa', '8217', 'interpersonal', 'angst.Then', 'other', 'hand', 'suppose', 'buy', 'large', 'family-sized', 'chocolate', 'bar', 'eat', 'whole', 'thing', 'once', '8217', 'be', 'sick', 'other', 'hand', 'ration', 'out', '8217', 'enjoy', 'afresh', 'time', 'out', 'latter', 'be', 'creative', 'approach', 'taken', 'DOC', 'MARTIN', 'team', 'plan', 'do', 'series', 'other', 'year', 'say', 'more', 'power', 'so', 'long', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'keep', 'things', 'fresh', 'avoid', 'recycled', 'plots', 'long-term', 'creative', 'endeavour', 'litmus', 'test', 'can', 'continue', 'move', 'forward', 'When', 'significant', 'financial', 'gain', 'connected', 'show', '8217', 'enormous', 'popularity', 'factor', 'even', 'more', 'tricky', 'achieve', 'temptation', 'settle', 'second', 'best', 'order', 'keep', 'cash', 'cow', 'feet', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'resist', 'Far', 'be', 'question', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'anyone', 'associated', 'outstanding', 'series', 'potential', 'factor.There', 'are', 'welcome', 'new', 'characters', 'Series', '5', 'most', 'notably', 'Martin', '8217', 'aunt', 'Ruth', 'played', 'eminent', 'Dame', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'Dame', 'Atkins', 'been', 'visible', 'TV', 'audiences', '50', 'years', 'acting', 'pedigree', 'exceptional', 'cast', 'comprised', 'such', 'luminaries', 'match', 'Martin', 'Clunes', 'who', 'one', 'most', 'versatile', 'stars', 'England', 'today', 'role', 'different', 'seeing', 'play', 'virtually', 'anything', 'else', 'astonishing', 'see', 'how', 'believable', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'Having', 'said', 'younger', 'talent', 'show', 'including', 'Jessica', 'Ransom', 'Doc', '8217', 'new', 'receptionist', 'Morwenna', 'hold', 'own', 'best', 'Ms.', 'Ransom', '8217', 's', 'case', 'appearing', 'opposite', 'acting', 'legend', 'Peter', 'Vaughan.Fans', 'show', 'will', 'love', 'Series', '5', 'much', 'enjoy', 'such', 'Bert', 'Large', '8217', 'continued', 'restaurant', 'travails', 'Aunt', 'Ruth', '8217', 'adjustment', 'wilds', 'Cornwall', 'well-intentioned', 'interference', 'Louisa', '8217', 'hippie', 'mother', 'ongoing', 'unrequited', 'passion', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'local', 'chemist', 'Mrs.', 'Tichell', 'Add', 'lovely', 'inspired', 'minor', 'comic', 'roles', 'such', 'couple', 'newlyweds', 'who', 'have', 'deal', 'nasty', 'skin', 'infection', 'midst', 'cleaving', 'one', 'have', 'inspired', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'comedy-drama.While', 'do', 'believe', 'show', 'peaked', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'imply', 'Series', '5', 'second-rate', 'Rather', 'simply', 'not', 'most', 'creative', 'adventures', '8217', 'seen', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'friends', 'Still', 'show', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'words', 'reviewer', '8220', 'completely', 'addictive', '8221', 'Just', 'try', 'NOT', 'watch', 'eight', 'episodes', 'matter', 'few', 'days', 'Betcha', 'can', '8217', 't', 'Take', 'year', 'off', 'Doc', '8217', 'see', 'next', 'time', 'thanks', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'not', 'making', 'wait', 'too', 'long', 'British', 'broadcast', 'episodes', 'North', 'American', 'DVD', 'release', 'Much', 'appreciated']",N/A

1451962,A35DSAZ6TD3J3W,B005A1GS00,Marc Albert,"[3, 5]","I came away from this series with mixed feelings.  I was glad to have viewed it and sorry when it ended.  Overall, I thought it was very good, especially the first 4 episodes but it started to go downhill from there with the eighth and last episode being a little silly and not up to the standards for the series itself.I was glad that a few characters were written out of the series, either by death or moving away (as it is with life) and new characters appearing to freshen up and add depth to the series.  This, to my mind, is not a comedy but rather a drama about life in a small English village, Port Wenn, where an emotionally disturbed doctor resides and interacts with the village inhabitants. I liked Martin's other Aunt (new one); she brings intelligence to the series.  Whereas, they typecast the new receptionist as another airhead, which would not have been my choice if I was writing it.  Why not someone at the front desk who is sharp and could make up for the social skills Doc Martin obviously lacks, someone who could stand up to him, giving it to him as good as she gets?As for Doc Martin in Series 5, he is grumpier than ever.  He is as awkward, distant, lacking in social skills and empathy as before.  He is oblivious to the emotions of others and how and what he says impacts those around him.  We are being treated to someone who very well mimics the symptoms of Asperger's Syndrome.  He has very much difficulty in the ability, if any at all, to recognize the feelings and frustrations that Louisa goes through in her interaction with him.  She looks truly exhausted.  I wonder if its real and she is tiring of this character and the series, or she is just playing the part of a mother with a baby and a job to hold down, whereas the father has little involvement other than occasionally babysitting.  He is truly an unlikable character but you also know that he is not aware of his actions and their repercussions.  He doesn't have a clue.The cute baby is the star of series 5 and his presence almost breaks through Doc Martin's antisocial behavior at times.  When Louisa stabs her spoon into a soft-boiled egg in one scene, that seemed to have said it all.  It could have ended right there, but instead they carried on with last episode and ended it in such a way as to keep things alive for a Series 6.  For Louisa, in that scene, it seems that she finally realized that even though she loves Martin and he, in his way, loves her, this relationship is hopeless and will never blossom.  In this scene, while they are eating dinner, she clearly sees he will not or cannot ever change to any degree of emotional maturity, or be able to return her love in kind.I was sorry to see Series 5 end, but in a way, I am not looking forward to Series 6 if it perpetuates more of the same.  We are lead to believe in the end of the last episode that Doc Martin has magically transformed into an empathetic person who will remain in practice in Port Wenn and not take that job in London.  I didn't believe it.  But, for now they have left an opening and loose ends to tie for another Series of episodes.  I won't comment on the other characters as this series is all about Martin, Louisa and the baby.  The rest are there for background and context to fill out the drama.",4,"Good, but may have seen its best days",1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,3286,"['came', 'away', 'series', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'was', 'glad', 'have', 'viewed', 'sorry', 'when', 'ended', 'Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'first', '4', 'episodes', 'started', 'go', 'downhill', 'eighth', 'last', 'episode', 'being', 'little', 'silly', 'not', 'standards', 'series', 'itself.I', 'was', 'glad', 'few', 'characters', 'were', 'written', 'series', 'either', 'death', 'moving', 'away', 'life', 'new', 'characters', 'appearing', 'freshen', 'up', 'add', 'depth', 'series', 'mind', 'not', 'comedy', 'rather', 'drama', 'life', 'small', 'English', 'village', 'Port', 'Wenn', 'where', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'doctor', 'resides', 'interacts', 'village', 'inhabitants', 'liked', 'Martin', 'other', 'Aunt', 'new', 'one', 'intelligence', 'series', 'Whereas', 'typecast', 'new', 'receptionist', 'airhead', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'choice', 'was', 'writing', 'Why', 'not', 'someone', 'front', 'desk', 'who', 'sharp', 'could', 'make', 'up', 'social', 'skills', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'obviously', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'stand', 'up', 'giving', 'as', 'good', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'Series', '5', 'grumpier', 'ever', 'as', 'awkward', 'distant', 'lacking', 'social', 'skills', 'empathy', 'before', 'oblivious', 'emotions', 'others', 'how', 'what', 'impacts', 'are', 'being', 'treated', 'someone', 'who', 'very', 'well', 'mimics', 'symptoms', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', 'very', 'much', 'difficulty', 'ability', 'recognize', 'feelings', 'frustrations', 'Louisa', 'interaction', 'truly', 'exhausted', 'wonder', 'real', 'tiring', 'character', 'series', 'just', 'playing', 'part', 'mother', 'baby', 'job', 'hold', 'down', 'father', 'little', 'involvement', 'other', 'occasionally', 'babysitting', 'truly', 'unlikable', 'character', 'also', 'know', 'not', 'aware', 'actions', 'repercussions', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue.The', 'cute', 'baby', 'star', 'series', '5', 'presence', 'almost', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'antisocial', 'behavior', 'times', 'When', 'Louisa', 'stabs', 'spoon', 'soft-boiled', 'egg', 'one', 'scene', 'seemed', 'have', 'said', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'right', 'there', 'instead', 'carried', 'last', 'episode', 'ended', 'way', 'keep', 'things', 'alive', 'Series', '6', 'Louisa', 'scene', 'finally', 'realized', 'even', 'Martin', 'way', 'relationship', 'hopeless', 'will', 'never', 'blossom', 'scene', 'are', 'eating', 'dinner', 'clearly', 'will', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'ever', 'change', 'degree', 'emotional', 'maturity', 'be', 'able', 'return', 'love', 'kind.I', 'was', 'sorry', 'see', 'Series', '5', 'end', 'way', 'am', 'not', 'looking', 'forward', 'Series', '6', 'more', 'same', 'are', 'lead', 'believe', 'end', 'last', 'episode', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'magically', 'transformed', 'empathetic', 'person', 'who', 'will', 'remain', 'practice', 'Port', 'Wenn', 'not', 'take', 'job', 'London', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'now', 'have', 'left', 'opening', 'loose', 'ends', 'tie', 'Series', 'episodes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'comment', 'other', 'characters', 'series', 'Martin', 'Louisa', 'baby', 'rest', 'are', 'there', 'background', 'context', 'fill', 'out', 'drama']",N/A

Wooldridge,"[3, 3]","During the showings of Doc Martin Series 5, wondering (hoping, anxious to see!)if there would be a Series Six, I decided to check out the Amazon reviews. I read them all. One of them is so pessimistic that I wonder if Dr. Ellingham's personality has rubbed off on the writer of that one, which very much disheartened me. I learned there, that Aunt Ruth is not a good replacement for Aunt Joan: I disagree. Each has her own personality. Though I miss Aunt Joan (Stephanie Cole), Aunt Ruth, being a psychologist for the criminally insane at Broadmoor, could turn out to be invaluable, perhaps having insights into the Doc---who most definitely is obviously NOT criminally insane---that could prove very helpful. Who is to say which beneficial avenues she could suggest, that would be helpful to Martin in future?The reviewer sees Louisa as very, very tired and fed up, and wonders if she and the whole cast, actually, are sick of acting in this series. Well. I became disheartened to the degree that I wondered if I wanted to continue to watch Series 5. It's good that I persevered! I saw for myself that yes, Louisa does seem tired, but so is any new mother (I know I was, raising 4 little children, not just one. Right from the first child I was continually tired from the neck down). I slogged  through my days worse than Louisa does. Okay, then, so she stabs her boiled egg with her spoon. Many of us have done much worse, being sleep deprived. Besides that, she is so, so let down that her Martin just doesn't express his true feelings even though she can (I just know) see that the feelings are there.On to Doc Martin himself: whenever he so much as SEES Louisa, his entire face becomes much softer, though the dissatisfied expression mostly is still there. But his voice goes soft and light, every single time, as it has throughout all 5 series, when he says, ""LouIsa...""(yes, with emphasis in the middle of her name.""LouIsa..."". She seems to take a bit of hope, then, but each time he goes back almost (almost!) to his usual demeanor. Watch for that, folks, that 'almost'. It's a key, as is his expression the night he gives in and says she can name their baby James Henry, after her grandfaher instead of Henry James, after his. He drops the bombshell that he has made out the proper forms and written James Henry as baby's name, then goes back to his book. When he looks up again, watching Louisa preparing for bedtime, there is---watch carefully---the very tiniest upturn of the corners of his mouth. It's almost not there at all. But you'll see it. There truly is more to Dr. Ellingham that meets the eye, perhaps more than even he realizes. (Martin Clunes is such a fine actor, bringing out these nuances in just the right way. Never overdone).This gave me the huge hope---even though Louisa can't seem to meet him halfway by being pleasant and accepting---that there is indeed hope that this Series 5 can end on a good note. Could we hope for more? Maybe we'll have reason to!Remember, too, the opening of one of the Series 5 episodes; the little boy (who looks so much like Martin) with the butterfly in his net, who bursts into his dad's office, shouting for him to see his butterfly, only to be squelched by dad's reaction. Martin WASN'T always as we see him now. Next, in present time, Doc Martin awakes from this dream and begins his usual grumpy day. So there we are. The instances I've mentioned, show us that Series 5 can (and, actually, did) end on a good note! Can we hope for more? I think so. No writer worth his salt would end a book, or a series, on such a downer as I expected after reading the review that so disturbed my quality of life (of mind?!)for several days after I read it. These writers have more to them, than that.This series deserves a #6 which, it seems, we are to get, according to very reliable sources I've recently come across. Well done, well done! Take heart, everyone. Onward! We all can't wait....

It's so funny; we found it necessary to buy the series and pre-order Season 5. Doc Martin is an irascible General Practitioner who was a successful Obstetrician based in London. The reason for his move is one you will have to find out by buying this series. Funny as Hell and the people who suffer his ministrations are lovable Provincials whose characters are all well-developed by the writers. He is a very capable diagnostician but has no people skills of which to speak. Especially delightful to lovers of the English language is the dialogue he and others use. Notable among these it the three word put-down he uses on the ""Doctor's Friend"". Note them well, it's something to admire in the British. Use them here in the States on the unwashed masses and you'll get away with it, they won't know how you've just put them in their place. There are a delicious number of love interests that develop in the series and the sexual tension is heightened when Doc Martin inadvertently meets up with an old colleague, a provocative London Cardiologist; a lovely bit of red-haired pastry that I would be hard pressed to resist. The 5th season continues with one important character deleted only to be replaced by another who is portrayed by one of the most talented English actresses working today and to top it off, she is as hard-nosed as Doc Martin! I reacted with pleasure to every one of her appearances. A number of other actors that are recognizable by viewers of earlier BBC Masterpiece presentations appear in cameo roles. I kept awaiting that delightfully erotic nymphet of a surgeon to appear again in series 5, to no avail.  Series 6, which is sorely needed and will be equally as welcome as the preceding ones will hopefully bring that red-haired miscreant back to complicate Doc Martins life once again.  Someone must stand up to this man, and she can do it in the most devastating manner! Having the new baby complicates everyones life, it's surprising the baby survives its numerous caregivers, one of whom is found to be wearing an electronic ankle bracelet that the court ordered! For relief from the tense world we live in at present I (and you should also) turn to ""Doc Martin"" to help forget our worries. Don't rely on PBS to replay this series when you'd like to see it again; add it to your library: then you and your friends and visiting relatives can be lured into the lush and beautiful countryside on the Cornish coast, how I envy them some of the views they see every day in ""Portwenn"".
