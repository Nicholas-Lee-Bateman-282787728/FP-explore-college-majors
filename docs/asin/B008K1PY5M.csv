1568936,A24PTVSZSM8968,B008K1PY5M,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","This movie follows the outlandish formula of a girl who has to come up with a fake boyfriend to keep her family happy at Christmas. This premise has formed the basis of other Christmas movies, none of which end up being terribly believable or well done. This one does not depart from the formula. In this case, a seemingly nice girl with an apparently overbearing mom has a falling out with her successful lawyer-fiancee right before Thanksgiving. Rather than tell the truth, she lets her friend talk her into hiring an actor to play the part of the boyfriend. Unlike some similar movies, the two seem to get along well from the beginning. Both are good looking characters and are very likable. While they seem to have the potential for a lot of chemistry, and while there are a few scenes where they really seem to bond, the romantic payoff isn't quite as great as in some movies. There are a number of potential side stories involving friends and family members that aren't really developed all that much and the main story isn't even really developed terribly much. On the positive side, there aren't too many embarrassing or implausible moments aside from the silly idea of having a fake fiancee, so the story is watchable and you really end up liking the characters and hoping they end up together. Unfortunately, there are a number of loose ends and the main love story is missing the real spark that could make this a true gem. It's definitely watchable and pretty decent for a TV movie, but it could have been more. I would rate this in the middle of the pack of TV Christmas movies. It certainly isn't the worst, but it also isn't a classic. It is worth checking out if you like this kind of movie.",4,Nice but not great,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,1707,"['movie', 'outlandish', 'formula', 'girl', 'who', 'come', 'up', 'fake', 'boyfriend', 'keep', 'family', 'happy', 'Christmas', 'premise', 'formed', 'basis', 'other', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'none', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'terribly', 'believable', 'well', 'done', 'one', 'not', 'depart', 'formula', 'case', 'seemingly', 'nice', 'girl', 'apparently', 'overbearing', 'mom', 'falling', 'out', 'successful', 'lawyer-fiancee', 'right', 'Thanksgiving', 'Rather', 'tell', 'truth', 'friend', 'talk', 'hiring', 'actor', 'play', 'part', 'boyfriend', 'similar', 'movies', 'two', 'seem', 'get', 'along', 'well', 'beginning', 'are', 'good', 'looking', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'likable', 'seem', 'have', 'potential', 'lot', 'chemistry', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'really', 'seem', 'bond', 'romantic', 'payoff', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'great', 'movies', 'are', 'number', 'potential', 'side', 'stories', 'involving', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'developed', 'much', 'main', 'story', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'developed', 'terribly', 'much', 'positive', 'side', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'embarrassing', 'implausible', 'moments', 'aside', 'silly', 'idea', 'having', 'fake', 'fiancee', 'story', 'watchable', 'really', 'end', 'up', 'liking', 'characters', 'hoping', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'number', 'loose', 'ends', 'main', 'love', 'story', 'missing', 'real', 'spark', 'could', 'make', 'true', 'gem', 'definitely', 'watchable', 'pretty', 'decent', 'TV', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'would', 'rate', 'middle', 'pack', 'TV', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'worst', 'also', ""n't"", 'classic', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'like', 'kind', 'movie']",N/A

1568965,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B008K1PY5M,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Oh, man, I should quit already from posting these Christmas movie reviews, what with the holiday in the rear view now. But I still got the spirit in me. So here's my two cents on Holiday Engagement, a better-than-average offering from 2011 off the Hallmark channel. Me, I remember how amazing Shelley Long looked inNight Shift (Keep Case)(1982), and I feel the age in my bones when I gaze at her now and she's on the small screen playing a thirty-something woman's mom. And maybe you can blame Meredith Burns (Long) for her daughter's occasional anxiety attacks. She's the pushy sort who frequently exhorts her daughter, Hillary (Bonnie Somerville), to land a steady man already, lest she becomes a lonely spinster.Hillary is a gifted writer, a journalist for a newspaper that - sucks for Hillary - just shut down. Soon after, she's dumped by her fianc&eacute;, Jason (Chris McKenna), this inattentive corporate litigator on the fast track. So here's Hillary in the deep mopes. And, calamitously, just before the break-up, she'd sworn up and down to her mom that, this time, yep, definitely this time, she'll bring the beau over for that long Thanksgiving weekend. The only good thing to come out of this stretch of days is that she'd entered a radio contest and won a trip for two to Mexico.Hillary's dread of disappointing her mother compels her to do something outlandish - okay, her best chum, Sophie (Edi Patterson), talks her into it. She places an ad online looking to cast someone as her fianc&eacute; to take home to meet the fam. Follows then the film's most comic sequence as she and Sophie screen the sometimes shaky applicants. Hillary finally settles on the least offensive candidate - David (Jordan Bridges), struggling actor, 33, Libra, coffee-stained barista, drives a beat up '98 Jeep Grand Cher0kee. About to embark, hearing of David's sorry ride, she opts to take her car.So, Bonnie Somerville's performance makes me want to see more of her. There's something inherently appealing about her, a blend of girl-next-door pretty and a groundedness and a wistfulness. I bought into her character from the film's opening minutes, when we find out that her most favorite song ever is ""Gloria in Excelsis Deo,"" a preference that pays off later in the movie. Hillary and Sophie's early screening process aside, there are enough other showcase moments to tide you over. The bulk of the story finds Hillary and David having to extricate themselves from various potential slip-ups. Man, fake engagements are tough to pull off, especially when the demanding mom has got that penetrating need for details. But maybe Hillary didn't need to blurt out that they'd set a wedding date of December 21st.Laid back Jordan Bridges easily plays off Somerville. It took a minute to dawn on me that he's ""Frankie"" from TNT's Rizzoli & Isles. He and Somerville are very winning in the film's best scene, when they perform a lovely impromptu duet of Hillary's favorite song. It helps that Shelley Long hasn't lost her comedic punch. Haylie Duff lends support as the sort of snobbish sister Trish. Chris McKenna lands the thankless role of the bad boyfriend, and that everyone in my living room was booing the heck out of him is a backhanded testament to how effective he is as a self-absorbed jackwagon. When Hillary ends up at that inevitable crossroad, there really isn't much suspense as to which way she'd go, never mind that David himself wrestles with his own love life dilemma. Okay, you're familiar with the core story arc, and the romantic developments aren't breaking news material. What makes this movie worth watching - what gives it its replay value - is its fine execution and its light touch and committed acting by a good cast. It's effortless work delivered by Somerville, Long, and Bridges. It's still not recommended that you hire pretend fianc&eacute;s online. That's what Pennysaver is for.",4,"From now on, when I make my move on the ladies, I'll dim the lights and put on the apparently seductive ""Gloria in Excelsis Deo""",1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,3903,"['Oh', 'man', 'should', 'quit', 'already', 'posting', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'reviews', 'what', 'holiday', 'rear', 'view', 'now', 'still', 'got', 'spirit', 'So', 'here', 'two', 'cents', 'Holiday', 'Engagement', 'better-than-average', 'offering', '2011', 'Hallmark', 'channel', 'Me', 'remember', 'how', 'amazing', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'looked', 'inNight', 'Shift', 'Keep', 'Case', '1982', 'feel', 'age', 'bones', 'when', 'gaze', 'now', 'small', 'screen', 'playing', 'thirty-something', 'woman', 'mom', 'maybe', 'can', 'blame', 'Meredith', 'Burns', 'Long', 'daughter', 'occasional', 'anxiety', 'attacks', 'pushy', 'sort', 'who', 'frequently', 'daughter', 'Hillary', 'Bonnie', 'Somerville', 'land', 'steady', 'man', 'already', 'lest', 'lonely', 'spinster.Hillary', 'gifted', 'writer', 'journalist', 'newspaper', 'sucks', 'Hillary', 'just', 'shut', 'down', 'Soon', 'dumped', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Jason', 'Chris', 'McKenna', 'inattentive', 'corporate', 'litigator', 'fast', 'track', 'here', 'Hillary', 'deep', 'mopes', 'calamitously', 'just', 'break-up', ""'d"", 'sworn', 'up', 'down', 'mom', 'time', 'yep', 'definitely', 'time', ""'ll"", 'bring', 'beau', 'long', 'Thanksgiving', 'weekend', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'come', 'stretch', 'days', ""'d"", 'entered', 'radio', 'contest', 'won', 'trip', 'two', 'Mexico.Hillary', 'dread', 'disappointing', 'mother', 'do', 'something', 'outlandish', 'okay', 'best', 'chum', 'Sophie', 'Edi', 'Patterson', 'ad', 'online', 'looking', 'cast', 'someone', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'take', 'home', 'meet', 'fam', 'Follows', 'then', 'film', 'most', 'comic', 'sequence', 'Sophie', 'screen', 'sometimes', 'shaky', 'applicants', 'Hillary', 'finally', 'least', 'offensive', 'candidate', 'David', 'Jordan', 'Bridges', 'struggling', 'actor', '33', 'Libra', 'coffee-stained', 'barista', 'beat', 'up', ""'98"", 'Jeep', 'Grand', 'Cher0kee', 'embark', 'hearing', 'David', 'sorry', 'ride', 'take', 'car.So', 'Bonnie', 'Somerville', 'performance', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'something', 'inherently', 'appealing', 'blend', 'girl-next-door', 'pretty', 'groundedness', 'wistfulness', 'bought', 'character', 'film', 'opening', 'minutes', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'most', 'favorite', 'song', 'ever', 'Gloria', 'Excelsis', 'Deo', 'preference', 'off', 'later', 'movie', 'Hillary', 'Sophie', 'early', 'screening', 'process', 'aside', 'are', 'enough', 'other', 'showcase', 'moments', 'tide', 'bulk', 'story', 'Hillary', 'David', 'having', 'extricate', 'various', 'potential', 'slip-ups', 'Man', 'fake', 'engagements', 'are', 'tough', 'pull', 'off', 'especially', 'when', 'demanding', 'mom', 'got', 'penetrating', 'need', 'details', 'maybe', 'Hillary', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'blurt', 'out', ""'d"", 'set', 'wedding', 'date', 'December', '21st.Laid', 'back', 'Jordan', 'Bridges', 'easily', 'Somerville', 'took', 'minute', 'dawn', 'Frankie', 'TNT', 'Rizzoli', 'Isles', 'Somerville', 'are', 'very', 'winning', 'film', 'best', 'scene', 'when', 'perform', 'lovely', 'impromptu', 'duet', 'Hillary', 'favorite', 'song', 'Shelley', 'Long', ""n't"", 'lost', 'comedic', 'punch', 'Haylie', 'Duff', 'support', 'sort', 'snobbish', 'sister', 'Trish', 'Chris', 'McKenna', 'thankless', 'role', 'bad', 'boyfriend', 'everyone', 'living', 'room', 'was', 'booing', 'heck', 'backhanded', 'testament', 'how', 'effective', 'self-absorbed', 'jackwagon', 'When', 'Hillary', 'up', 'inevitable', 'crossroad', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'suspense', 'way', ""'d"", 'go', 'never', 'mind', 'David', 'own', 'love', 'life', 'dilemma', 'Okay', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'core', 'story', 'arc', 'romantic', 'developments', 'are', ""n't"", 'breaking', 'news', 'material', 'What', 'movie', 'watching', 'what', 'replay', 'value', 'fine', 'execution', 'light', 'touch', 'committed', 'acting', 'good', 'cast', 'effortless', 'work', 'delivered', 'Somerville', 'Long', 'Bridges', 'still', 'not', 'recommended', 'hire', 'pretend', 'fianc', 'eacute', 's', 'online', 'what', 'Pennysaver']",N/A

Olsen,"[82, 89]","Hillary Burns is looking forward to going home for the family Thanksgiving dinner this year, because this time she has a fiancee and her mother won't be disappointed in her. So it is a devastating blow when just days before the big dinner, her fiancee, Jason, calls the whole thing off. He says he needs to keep his priorities straight, stay focused on his career and not make a mistake. To make things even worse, the next day the newspaper for which she writes shuts down. She gets word while she is in the middle of interviewing one of those people who stand on street corners in costumes and wave big signs to get you to patronize a particular business. This guy happened to be dressed as a big, red cell phone.Trying to solve the problem of going home to Mom without a man, her friend and co-worker, Sophie, convinces her to place an online ad for a fake fiancee. Most of the responses are not an option. But then comes the one from the guy who had been dressed as the cell phone, who, oddly enough, seems to be a pretty normal guy named David. So home they go to meet Mama and Papa. Mama, played well by Shelley Long, is an overbearing busybody who is consumed with making sure everyone is happy as long as it is her idea of happiness. She keeps pressing Hillary to set a date so she can plan the wedding. Apparently she has been feeling deprived for not having been able to plan a single wedding for any of her three girls. Her oldest daughter eloped and the youngest is engaged to the man Mama picked out for her--and has been for 2 years. She feels Hillary is her only hope. Hillary gets caught up in the wedding plans until ""Jason"" (David) points out to her that there isn't really going to be any wedding. She gets a grip on herself, realizes things have gotten out of hand and sends David packing. That is when she also realizes that she has feelings for him.Despite appearances of normalcy, there is a lot of dysfunction going on in this family that surfaces as Hillary's deception unravels. But this is a Hallmark Christmas movie, so you can believe that things are going to end on a high note.It had a ""G"" rating on TV and seems pretty benign, but there were two things I could have done without--the constant use of the Lord's name as an exclamation, and when Meredith, Hillary's mom, shows Hillary and her ""fiancee"" to their beds for the weekend, she says because the Inn is full, she won't give them separate rooms, but they will have separate beds--so they are sharing Hillary's bedroom. That may not bother some people, but it also didn't make sense when later in the show they talk about how they can't understand why Hillary's older sister is staying at a hotel when they have plenty of room. Go figure.At times the acting goes a little over the top, but there are also some really sweet moments and some funny ones, too, in an awkward sort of way.

Shortly before Thanksgiving, he tells her that he will be moving and that their engagement is over. This news creates an immediate problem for Hillary. She's told her family that she will be arriving at the Thanksgiving dinner with her fianc&eacute;, whom the family hasn't met. She also has a pair of tickets for a Mexican beach vacation that she won in a radio contest. Courtesy of her adventurous friend, Bonnie comes up with an idea. Using the tickets as payment, she hires a struggling actor (Jordan Bridges) to portray her fianc&eacute; during the family visit. The rest of the story is strictly by the numbers.But ""by the numbers"" isn't necessarily bad, and Somerville and Bridges do have a chemistry--appropriately subdued early on--that makes the movie work. Shelley Long, as Hillary's mother, and Sam McMurray as her father, turn in solid performances that help. With the likability the actors exude, the film works for those who want this sort of movie.As this is a holiday movie, I'll add a bit about the setting. The majority of the movie is set during Thanksgiving. There is a slight nod to Christmas in that Hillary's mother decorates on the day after Thanksgiving. There is little religious content, and what little there is is conveniently ignored. (There is a scene in which Hillary's priest shows up and has a problem with the false fianc&eacute;'s being Jewish. While such a difference in faith could present a serious problem, there is no exploration of this topic. Why it arises at all is a puzzle, but then there are other problematic aspects of the script, such as the father's incessant questions of the man he thinks is his daughter's fianc&eacute;. These questions seem to indicate that the father is guilty of a crime, but, again, this idea is not explored in greater detail.)
