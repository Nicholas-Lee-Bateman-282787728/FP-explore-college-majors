Ok, how would you feel if on this already truncated single DVD is only one full episode with about a dozen selected bits as extras? This is what you are getting with SSOS, Vol 1. Feeling pretty disappointed aren't you...?The cheap skates at Public Broadcasting & Children's Television Workshop obviously think so little of their fans that this is their idea of a compilation DVD... On the one hand, I loved the trip down memory lane and all the great characters when they were young and exciting, unlike the more recent Sesame Street shows that are tired, rely way too much on Elmo, and don't intellectually challenge the kids). In addition, the extra bits that included are all great, great memory refreshers.But, and this is a BIG but, how can you release a supposed collection of DVD's that gives you so little? One episode per year???? A dozen or so extra bits per year????? Three of the twelve bits are simply actors saying the alphabet. Although it's neat to see well-known actors from 30-some years ago and this bit was a hallmark of Sesame Street episodes for years, it's hardly my idea of great television to watch someone speak the alphabet dead-pan (especially considering the DVD's are marketed to those of us who watched these shows as children).These compilations held so much promise. My only hope is that these are teaser DVD's and sometime in the future PBS/CTW will wake up and release larger collections.",2,"Great TV, but Severely Lacking",1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,1557,"['ow', 'would', 'feel', 'highlights', 'favorite', 'show', 'child', 'were', 'reduced', '1', 'DVD', 'year', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'Old', 'School', 'Ok', 'how', 'would', 'feel', 'already', 'truncated', 'single', 'DVD', 'only', 'one', 'full', 'episode', 'dozen', 'selected', 'bits', 'extras', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'SSOS', 'Vol', '1', 'Feeling', 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'are', ""n't"", 'cheap', 'skates', 'Public', 'Broadcasting', 'Children', 'Television', 'Workshop', 'obviously', 'think', 'so', 'little', 'fans', 'idea', 'compilation', 'DVD', 'one', 'hand', 'loved', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'great', 'characters', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'exciting', 'more', 'recent', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'shows', 'are', 'tired', 'rely', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'Elmo', 'do', ""n't"", 'intellectually', 'challenge', 'kids', 'addition', 'extra', 'bits', 'included', 'are', 'great', 'great', 'memory', 'refreshers.But', 'BIG', 'how', 'can', 'release', 'supposed', 'collection', 'DVD', 'so', 'little', 'One', 'episode', 'year', 'dozen', 'so', 'extra', 'bits', 'year', 'Three', 'twelve', 'bits', 'are', 'simply', 'actors', 'saying', 'alphabet', 'neat', 'see', 'well-known', 'actors', '30-some', 'years', 'ago', 'bit', 'was', 'hallmark', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'episodes', 'years', 'hardly', 'idea', 'great', 'television', 'watch', 'someone', 'speak', 'alphabet', 'dead-pan', 'especially', 'considering', 'DVD', 'are', 'marketed', 'who', 'watched', 'shows', 'children', '.These', 'compilations', 'held', 'so', 'much', 'promise', 'only', 'hope', 'are', 'teaser', 'DVD', 'sometime', 'future', 'PBS/CTW', 'will', 'wake', 'up', 'release', 'larger', 'collections']",Sesame Street: Old School - Volume 2

1095449,A3LHHW6WRRXEDJ,B000UNYJTK,"Micah B. Evans ""none""","[4, 6]","I was so happy when Vol 1 came out, then Vol 2 came out. More memories came flooding back to me when I watched this. You just cant beat Old School stuff like this. But, everything has its down fall. When you see an only for adults sticker on something that is suppose to be a learning tool and educationl for children, your heart has to drop. Mine did. I mean, I grew up with Sesame Street, watched it when I was a very young kid back in the late 60's to mid 70's, and  learned alot, and never ever thought about that there was anything wrong with it, or any subbliminal messages that they were trying to give us, nor did our parents worry about the content. But, it seems in this day and age, in this so called""POLITICALLY CORRECT"" world, something is going to offend someone, or hurt someone's feelings, or is going to offend their religion, color, race, creed, sexuality, etc....It was not like that back then, now it is. I read a review of vol 1. and it really amazed me, it really did, and it made me sad for todays kids and their parents also who buy into all this Political Correct B.S.. The reviewer pretty much was trying to say that times have changed, and this material was not suited for todays child, because of its sensitive and non political correct material (there is those two words again). One mother was quoted saying ""What did they do to us?"" Hmmmm, thats interseting. Hmmm, Mayby they were trying to teach us, in a fun, visual way, I dont know, thats just me speculating, I do that from time to time. Other quotes were that Cookie Monster was eating his way to diabetes. Now, I dont know about you, but when I was a kid, hardly any of us were overweight, because we were outside most of the time running, playing, and burning it all off, unlike alot of kids today, who sit in front of the tv, or play video games,and do not move for hours at the time, and eat junk food, and drink soft drinks, and get no exercise. Another little comment was about the neighbors walking with kids down the street, and enviting them over to the house for cookies and milk, and to meet their wife. Ok, I must admit, that was a little wierd, but you have to take all that into consideration, and the time period. Yes, you have to be leary of strangers, and you have to teach your kids that, but reading all that, I feel that people try to make something out of nothing. They try to look for things to get offended over, or things to get their feelings hurt over. Ok, then, Old School Sesame Street may not suite the needs of todays kids, but does a muppet with AIDS suite thier needs?I guess in this day and age, it does. I have to wonder about that. Its a sad world, but its a different world today.

This must be a joke. Why would anyone find this material unsuitable for any children? This is the cream of the crop right here. I put this thing in for my kid, and he watches in a way he watches nothing else, not even the modern ""appropriate"" Sesame Streets that are on TV these days. If I had to choose one thing to let my kid watch, it would be these Old School Sesame Streets. Lessons go far beyond the ABC's. Sesame Street old school deals with everyday life in an honest way, it is entertaining and hillarious too. I think so.The show these days makes an effort, but is bogged down too much with PC values, which make it not as fun as the old schools.Some of these characterizations are very plainly real, which is what makes them work so well. You have some characters like Don Music, who throws a fit when he cant get his lyrics right, or Jack-Be-Nimble, who is portrayed as a hippie biker type who gets mad at Kermit when Kermit corrects his mistake. ""Hey! Get off my case, Frog!""  ...by todays standards thats probably not as peachy clean as it should be. But as any kid who grew up with old school version of Sesame Street will know... It's not bad to be mad.On this set you get the season premieres from seasons 6-10, and bonuses. The thing with sesame street is that it purposely repeats bits all the time, which is the point of the show, so kids dont forget. So as in the first volume, some bits get repeated on the DVD. I would say that a third volume is necessary, staying away from full episodes and just giving us the leftover segments from the first ten years. While the full episodes are cool to have, it is obvious that any more will result in a lot more repeated bits...still, An hour of Sesame Street from the seventies is much more varied with different stuff than todays show which relys very heavily in its commercial characters like Elmo and Baby Bear. In this era there is input from a slew of very talented writers and cartoonists, and musicians and celebrities and filmakers, just tons of stuff to enjoy. I'm still a huge fan of the animal reels and how-they-make-it reels that no longer get played on the show. Remember when they showed us how to make chinese noodles? I find that my four year old gets bored easily with the new stuff on TV, like twenty minute Elmo segments, but is quite in tune with the cut and paste style, and fast moving segments of these shows. I believe it gives a child more of an incentive to see whats coming up next, when the segments are shorter. Sesame Street was right on the money in these days, and cannot be duplicated. Better disclaimers for this set may be, Warning: May encourage Free Thinking and Sense of Humor... Warning: Brilliant Television, may make your kid more fun to be around than most kids... or something to that effect. I really dig it and I'm pretty sure they've made ME more fun to be around. Don't pass it up for your kids just cuz of some lame disclaimer, this IS the real deal.",5,BRILLIANT MATERIAL FOR KIDS....,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,3090,"['Again', 'disclaimer', 'Old', 'School', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'sets', 'claiming', 'bits', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'todays', 'children', 'must', 'be', 'joke', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'find', 'material', 'unsuitable', 'children', 'cream', 'crop', 'right', 'here', 'put', 'thing', 'kid', 'way', 'nothing', 'else', 'not', 'even', 'modern', 'appropriate', 'Sesame', 'Streets', 'are', 'TV', 'days', 'had', 'choose', 'one', 'thing', 'let', 'kid', 'watch', 'would', 'be', 'Old', 'School', 'Sesame', 'Streets', 'Lessons', 'go', 'far', 'ABC', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'old', 'school', 'deals', 'everyday', 'life', 'honest', 'way', 'entertaining', 'hillarious', 'too', 'think', 'so.The', 'show', 'days', 'effort', 'bogged', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'PC', 'values', 'make', 'not', 'as', 'fun', 'old', 'schools.Some', 'characterizations', 'are', 'very', 'plainly', 'real', 'what', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'have', 'characters', 'Don', 'Music', 'who', 'fit', 'when', 'cant', 'get', 'lyrics', 'right', 'Jack-Be-Nimble', 'who', 'portrayed', 'hippie', 'biker', 'type', 'who', 'mad', 'Kermit', 'when', 'Kermit', 'mistake', 'Hey', 'Get', 'case', 'Frog', 'todays', 'standards', 'thats', 'probably', 'not', 'peachy', 'clean', 'should', 'be', 'kid', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'old', 'school', 'version', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'will', 'know', 'not', 'bad', 'be', 'mad.On', 'set', 'get', 'season', 'seasons', '6-10', 'bonuses', 'thing', 'sesame', 'street', 'purposely', 'bits', 'time', 'point', 'show', 'so', 'kids', 'dont', 'forget', 'So', 'first', 'volume', 'bits', 'get', 'repeated', 'DVD', 'would', 'say', 'third', 'volume', 'necessary', 'staying', 'away', 'full', 'episodes', 'just', 'giving', 'leftover', 'segments', 'first', 'ten', 'years', 'full', 'episodes', 'are', 'cool', 'have', 'obvious', 'more', 'will', 'result', 'lot', 'more', 'repeated', 'bits', 'still', 'hour', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'seventies', 'much', 'more', 'varied', 'different', 'stuff', 'todays', 'show', 'relys', 'very', 'heavily', 'commercial', 'characters', 'Elmo', 'Baby', 'Bear', 'era', 'input', 'slew', 'very', 'talented', 'writers', 'cartoonists', 'musicians', 'celebrities', 'filmakers', 'just', 'tons', 'stuff', 'enjoy', ""'m"", 'still', 'huge', 'fan', 'animal', 'reels', 'how-they-make-it', 'reels', 'longer', 'get', 'played', 'show', 'Remember', 'when', 'showed', 'how', 'make', 'chinese', 'noodles', 'find', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'bored', 'easily', 'new', 'stuff', 'TV', 'twenty', 'minute', 'Elmo', 'segments', 'quite', 'tune', 'cut', 'paste', 'style', 'fast', 'moving', 'segments', 'shows', 'believe', 'child', 'more', 'incentive', 'see', 'whats', 'coming', 'up', 'next', 'when', 'segments', 'are', 'shorter', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'was', 'right', 'money', 'days', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'duplicated', 'Better', 'disclaimers', 'set', 'may', 'be', 'Warning', 'May', 'encourage', 'Free', 'Thinking', 'Sense', 'Humor', 'Warning', 'Brilliant', 'Television', 'may', 'make', 'kid', 'more', 'fun', 'be', 'around', 'most', 'kids', 'something', 'effect', 'really', 'dig', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'made', 'ME', 'more', 'fun', 'be', 'around', 'Do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'kids', 'just', 'cuz', 'lame', 'disclaimer', 'real', 'deal']",Sesame Street: Old School - Volume 2
