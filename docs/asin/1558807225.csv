178566,A2RNUR847O8EHZ,1558807225,Amazon Customer,"[3, 5]","HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS is a cross between a cryptozoologist's, X-FILESs, dream film and a Hallmark special off Lifetime.  It is THE FAMILY MAN meets THE MOTHMAN.  And, if you like big, harry sasquatches and functional, happy families that take them in, well this is the flick for you.This family film has E.T. written all over it.  You've got cute, loveable kids and a furry, caring, mythical creature.  The parents just don't know what to do when they slam into the sasquatch while driving through the forest on vacation and apparently kill him in his Bigfoot tracks.  However, when they strap the creature to the car-roof to drive him to a local fairy-tale vet's office, he turns out to be not only fictitious, but also very much alive.  The rollicking tale and fun that follows can only be stopped by, you guessed it, a Bigfoot hunter with the wrong motivation in mind.All kidding aside, I loved this flick when I was a kid.  We had a VHS copy of the film, and my brothers and I wore it out something nuts.  HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS is a family film.  It's great for children and people who have yet to accept the fact that unicorns, Bigfeet and the Loch Ness Monster are ""pretend.""  Meanwhile, you and your friends might enjoy picking this monster up from video stores on a rainy night when you just feeling like laughing at extreme silliness.  I mean, c'mon guys, we're talking about some folks that run over a sasquatch and take it back to suburbia where it becomes a part of the family.  If that won't make you laugh, I just don't know what will.  I'm laughing just thinking about it.  The part when Harry gets into the car and his head makes the roof bulge up, because he's so tall and big and strong..... golly that's just the best!Well, John Lithgow (FOOTLOSE; SHREK) may be one of the best banjo players this side of Uranus, but all that fingerpicking sure doesn't get in the way of his fathering/acting skills.  He's constantly caught between doing what he thinks would be best for his family and his compassion for imaginary, Harries.  However, when Jacques LaFleur (David Suchet - GREYSTOKE; A PERFECT MURDER), a hunter out for Bigfoot blood, starts sniffing the sasquatch trail, Harry and co. are forced to recruit Dr. Wallace Wrightwood (Don Ameche - TRADING PLACES; COCOON), a Bigfoot enthusiast, and flee to the hills to save Harry.  Isn't that a unique tail?While the film is a winner in many ways, one can't escape the fact that Bigfoot is not a real creature!  This staggering statement can't be ignored.  Throughout the film, you just can't help but laugh and comment, ""Hang on just a darn second!  Now, that's not real.  There's no such thing as Bigfoot.""  And, then you'd laugh out loud and smack yourself on the knee.Overall, HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS is a must-own rental for anyone with a flare for cheesy movies about nonsensically impossible creatures and the families they love.",4,&quot;It's A Major Discovery.

It still holds up as a simultaneously funny and touching film. The setup is that a family goes camping and literally runs into bigfoot on the way home. Thinking the creature is dead, dad, played by John Lithgow, takes the body home expecting to get rich from his discovery. Of course, Harry's not really dead and when he comes around in the suburban setting, he wrecks havoc, while at the same time befriending the family and putting them in greater touch with their own humanity. The public doesn't want to hear anything except that the giant creature is a manical monster and there's also an obsessed  hunter on Harry's trail, thus making it a race to get him back where he belongs.  A lot of the credit for making this work has to go to Kevin Peter Hall, the seven foot-two-inch actor under the makeup who gives the titular character his humanity. Hall was also seen as the mutant bear in Prophecy and the alien of the first two Predator movies. This film hints at what he might have been able to go on to if he had hadn't died in 1991 of AIDS he contracted from a contaminated blood transfusion he received after a car accident.  Some credit is also due Rick Baker's creature makeup, which won an Oscar for this film. There's also a great visual gag at the very end which always impressed me. Lithgow, who is thin and bears a full head of hair, is terrific here, as is the entire cast. The almost omnipresent Don Ameche shows up as an anthropologist so wounded by his own search for bigfoot years earlier that he's reluctant to believe again that the creature could be real. Director William Dear, who went on to make Wild America and the 1994 remake of Angels in the Outfield,  brings a E.T-ish approach and it works. The extras on the 25th anniversary disc aren't great, but there is a making of featurette as well as more recent comments from the director. My only complaint (and I can't believe I'm writing this) is that the environmental message is almost too heavy-handed but it's done with a lot of humor.

I was of the former category and because of that, as an adult, I find the movie hilarious still and fun, with a great message and a motivational theme.  Still, if you do not fall into these categories it does not take away from the awesome that is this movie.  It might just be necessary for you to get in touch with your child side.  The use of the giant suit wrapped around a rather large man keeps the aesthetic modern since no CG was used.  Therefore, even today kids will be able to enjoy this classic.When John Lithgow's category accidentally hits a Bigfoot with his car after a camping trip with his family in the Washington State wilderness his life gets turned upside down.  The Hendersons bring home the myth and legend in hopes of making money for themselves, but little do they know that this Bigfoot is tougher than he looks and is not dead.  What ensues is a hilarious montage of scenes where a hunter keeps trying to kill the designated &#34;Harry Henderson&#34; while the Hendersons try to keep their house in good order, their neighbors from knowing about their new family member, and juggle with the idea of setting Harry free.A great story for kids and for those of you in touch with your kid side!",5,A Classic,1384905600,"11 20, 2013",2013,1368,"['Harry', 'Hendresons', 'one', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'kid', 'kids', 'rather', 'ridiculous', 'silly', 'movie', 'was', 'former', 'category', 'adult', 'find', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'still', 'fun', 'great', 'message', 'motivational', 'theme', 'Still', 'do', 'not', 'fall', 'categories', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'awesome', 'movie', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'necessary', 'get', 'touch', 'child', 'side', 'use', 'giant', 'suit', 'wrapped', 'rather', 'large', 'man', 'aesthetic', 'modern', 'CG', 'was', 'used', 'Therefore', 'even', 'today', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'classic.When', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'category', 'accidentally', 'Bigfoot', 'car', 'camping', 'trip', 'family', 'Washington', 'State', 'wilderness', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'Hendersons', 'bring', 'home', 'myth', 'legend', 'hopes', 'making', 'money', 'little', 'do', 'know', 'Bigfoot', 'tougher', 'not', 'dead', 'What', 'hilarious', 'montage', 'scenes', 'where', 'hunter', 'trying', 'kill', 'designated', '34', 'Harry', 'Henderson', '34', 'Hendersons', 'try', 'keep', 'house', 'good', 'order', 'neighbors', 'knowing', 'new', 'family', 'member', 'juggle', 'idea', 'setting', 'Harry', 'free.A', 'great', 'story', 'kids', 'touch', 'kid', 'side']",N/A

John Lithgow once again shows just how talented he is in his portrayal of George Henderson, the poor beleagured &quot;owner&quot; of this huge creature that  he mistakenly believes that he has killed by accident.  Lithgow can, of  course, portray a wide range of emotions very well, and his many talents  are greatly used in this wonderful story.  Melinda Dillon as wife Nancy is  the perfect match for George, and does a fabulous job, as always.  Watch  for a hilarious turn by Lainie Kazan as the goofy, nosey next-door  neighbor--what a hoot!  Don Ameche brings his usual excellence to the roll  of a non-believing believer who has searched his whole life for what poor  George has stumbled upon quite by accident.  The dinner table scene when he  comes face-to-face with the real thing will put a lump in your throat every  time you watch it!  And if you aren't familiar with David Suchet away from  the outstanding &quot;Poirot&quot; series on PBS, wait until you see his  turn as the sleazy, nasty hunter determined to bag the ultimate  trophy--Harry!  Additionally, it's no surprise that awards were won by the  individuals responsible for the incredible make-up job that was necessary  to convincingly portray the huge, massive Sasquatch.

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[15, 26]","Yes, two times in two days [1987] and add to that 30 miles in each direction, but this IS a magical film. I can't quite explain it, but I still find myself longing and waiting for every scene. This is the ultimate family film, minus a little PG language added strictly for the comic effect.Harry, of course, is ""BIGFOOT"" and he met ""The Hendersons"" when they were vacationing in the wildness near Seattle. They ran into him twice with their super-sized family station wagon. After the first of many family spectacles, Harry is tied to the roof of their Vista Cruiser [covered of course to hide what might be seen by onlookers] and literally brought home to become a rather odd family pet. The father [John Lithgow] went through a kind of epiphany when he tried to shoot the Bigfoot when ""Harry"" first awakened after being brought home as a captive and commenced to trash the Henderson's home. Once George Henderson found he could not kill such a creature he and the entire family were at the mercy of the huge non-housebroken creature's heavy-footed frolicking.Don Ameche puts in a very credible performance as the world-weary, jaded ""Big Foot"" author, who had lost everything trying to prove such wondrous beings exist. He now ran a kind of run down ""Big Foot Museum"" near where the Hendersons found Harry.Of course, to give the movie an impetus we have a desperate, fanatical hunter, Jacques LaFleur [David Suchet] who is on Harry's trail and will settle for nothing less than Harry as his trophy. So the movie that starts out rather mildly turns into a desperate race to get Harry back to the wilderness before ""LaFleur"" catches up with him. In between we have Lainie Kazan playing the nosy New York-sounding neighbor for a nice touch of comic tension. How will this all end? See the movie. That is the fun part. This is the kind of film that can be watched until the tape wears out and is surprisingly watchable for adults.

When they think he's dead, they put him on the roof of the car. During the night, George Henderson wakes up and finds that Bigfoot is still alive. After a while, the family come to realize that he's gentle, and harmless, so they name him Harry. While the whole town is on the hunt for Harry, the Henderons must take Harry take to back to his home in the wilderness. I love when Harry laughs at the tv, and when George is on the news saying ""My name is George Hen.""

178639,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,1558807225,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[0, 0]","I've always had a soft spot for this totally engaging little comedy about a family who accidentally hit what seems to be THE Bigfoot on a returning camping trip & bring the big guy home. What starts off as a rather terrifying encounter with the sasquatch in their Seattle home turns into a fun series of comic moments as the oversized creature begins to wreck their home. Soon, it becomes apparent to the Hendersons that ""Harry"" is not the fearsome figure imagined in the public's eye, but rather, a compassionate & intuitive soul (and a devout vegetarian) who bonds with the family. What makes up the rest of the film are the family's efforts to get Harry back to the wild (can you really keep a sasquatch in suburbia?) before an obsessed hunter can get to him first.There are sprinklings of messages about man's obsession to hunt & kill, and of course, their misconceptions of what Harry is really like. But at the heart of all this is the special friendship between matriarch George Henderson & Harry, often touching & insightful. Director William Dear seems to hit all the right notes in this offbeat comedy. And the cast is simply wonderful: John Lithgow as George, Melinda Dillon (remember her as Ralphie's Mom in ""A Christmas Story""?) as the wife, David Suchet as the half-crazed hunter, Lainie Kazan as the nosy but concerned neighbor, and the late great Don Ameche is dandy as a Bigfoot expert who gets to meet the big guy face-to-face. But the one who really steals the show is Harry himself. Thanks to the combined talents of make-up effects wizard Rick Baker & the ingenious acting of Kevin Peter Hall, Harry is a wonderment of expression, comic timing, and heart. He's truly amazing to behold...and mind you, this is years off before CGI was used.A family classic that can be enjoyed again & again!",5,Endearingly funny,1262736000,"01 6, 2010",2010,1811,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'soft', 'spot', 'totally', 'engaging', 'little', 'comedy', 'family', 'who', 'accidentally', 'hit', 'what', 'be', 'THE', 'Bigfoot', 'returning', 'camping', 'trip', 'bring', 'big', 'guy', 'home', 'What', 'off', 'rather', 'terrifying', 'encounter', 'sasquatch', 'Seattle', 'home', 'fun', 'series', 'comic', 'moments', 'oversized', 'creature', 'wreck', 'home', 'Soon', 'apparent', 'Hendersons', 'Harry', 'not', 'fearsome', 'figure', 'imagined', 'public', 'eye', 'rather', 'compassionate', 'intuitive', 'soul', 'devout', 'vegetarian', 'who', 'bonds', 'family', 'What', 'up', 'rest', 'film', 'are', 'family', 'efforts', 'get', 'Harry', 'back', 'wild', 'can', 'really', 'keep', 'sasquatch', 'suburbia', 'obsessed', 'hunter', 'can', 'get', 'first.There', 'are', 'sprinklings', 'messages', 'man', 'obsession', 'hunt', 'kill', 'course', 'misconceptions', 'what', 'Harry', 'really', 'like', 'heart', 'special', 'friendship', 'matriarch', 'George', 'Henderson', 'Harry', 'often', 'touching', 'insightful', 'Director', 'William', 'Dear', 'hit', 'right', 'notes', 'offbeat', 'comedy', 'cast', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'George', 'Melinda', 'Dillon', 'remember', 'Ralphie', 'Mom', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'wife', 'David', 'Suchet', 'half-crazed', 'hunter', 'Lainie', 'Kazan', 'nosy', 'concerned', 'neighbor', 'late', 'great', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'dandy', 'Bigfoot', 'expert', 'who', 'meet', 'big', 'guy', 'face-to-face', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'show', 'Harry', 'Thanks', 'combined', 'talents', 'make-up', 'effects', 'wizard', 'Rick', 'Baker', 'ingenious', 'acting', 'Kevin', 'Peter', 'Hall', 'Harry', 'wonderment', 'expression', 'comic', 'timing', 'heart', 'truly', 'amazing', 'behold', 'mind', 'years', 'CGI', 'was', 'used.A', 'family', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'again', 'again']",N/A

At first they fear it was a man, but when they examine the ""body"" they find it's a ""bigfoot"". They think it's dead so they decide to take it home there could be some money in this. As you guessed it isn't dead. Far from being the ferocious monster they fear ""Harry"" to be, he's a friendly giant. In their attempts to keep Harry a secret, the Henderson's have to hide him from the authorities and a man, who has made it his goal in life, to catch a bigfoot.
