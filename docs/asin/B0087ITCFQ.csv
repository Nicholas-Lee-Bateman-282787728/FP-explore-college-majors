It was panned by the critics everywhere and it was a box office failure, but I still watched it and I'm glad I did. The story is refreshing, the music is great and it stays to reality; also the characters are very relatable to anyone's friend circle: the two best friends, the ""bitchy"" girl, the guy friends and the good-looking guy.I also liked the fact of the use of technology, which is a thing that moves teens nowadays and that's the way everybody stays in touch and it was well used for the plot.I also liked the fact that they also gave Demi Moore some minutes for her character because it's so typical that in teen movies you only see the parents when they are home and you never get to know about their story, it's always about the teens, but not in this one.If you're looking for a good teen movie, try LOL, it's not really something new, but you'll have a good time.

1548015,A2YH3YTPSCAWF9,B0087ITCFQ,"Anthony Marinelli ""marilread""","[0, 0]","Here we have a film..in which it really is a director's film..and she sais she has much $$ and adds a commentary and although many didnt appreciate the contours in which the film is shot its interesting to look at as a french filmmaker looks at a suburban mther daughter relationship and the issues there, and also with another group of adults with similar issues, like a control and regular group, who dont appear to be all that different, and then the daughter goes globetrotting away from the suburbs..to varying locales. I think at first viewing it is doubtful an american director, the makeup, the way its shot, scenes..that crossed my mind and the way the french scenes are shot that is more apparent? I enjoyed the film and the issues raised and the failure in a certain sense, is to accomodate two scene presences, demi moore and miley cyrus? DEmi i believe during the filming was in therapy or some problem..but her scenes here are fully realized..much more then in all her seductress roles, the reluctant amour, she seems more into this role..and miley must respond in her scenes with demi..which is an acting chore from her standpoint? The director here has to accomodate.and he has to showcase miley..and i believe she really wants to show the mother's side..and she really is constraine dsince she knows what her viewers expect..thats why casting often changes what you get, and the two actresses want the film and their presence to make it their film..i'm kidding and im glad on film sets this stuff doesnt go on..but it often goes into the writing and set ups? There is a film 9 to 5..here the action is geared to the nocturnal..the talk action drama..unlike the film 9 to 5..characters who live the whole day for whatever reason..the adolescent mind seems all pervasive..from just about every angle even the girls fight among lovers..and betray each other..this story of prolonged adolescent..the sleeping bear syndrome? the action picks up in detroit chicago and france//the models..beautifully photographed..will have everyone flocking from the world for parisienne fashions and lifestyle, to gawk and take a photo..wonderfully photographed and the american scenes on the subway..the early shot and the lifestyles dont match up..with the paris life or what life should be and transitions are shot throughout the film..did you find the scenes in a few places unsubtle..sometimes the director goes overboard especially with ascene in class with an apple..entertaining film, which tries to tell so much from miley cyrus..and her loves..and battles with men and women..post adolescent life..and demi moore the maternal star with 3 real kids i think, and she comes off real good as the mother, ..INdecent Proposal and Disclosure, such scenes are in the background here, also JUROR..here we have the maternal..the 9 to 5 persona..if not sunrise to sunset..and the different scenes, and the way this europen director sets them up...lift this film from the mundane? I recall a music video as a kid..""voulez vous coucher avec moi?""..i think out of Quebec which is different from quebec french...quebecois french..louisianna french..here we have parisienne french..and the scenes of france..the young and lifestyle...make us all want to flock as the youn gpersons pictures here..",4,Globe trotting cast..in mother daughter film,1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,3287,"['Here', 'have', 'film..in', 'really', 'director', 'film..and', 'much', 'commentary', 'many', 'didnt', 'appreciate', 'contours', 'film', 'shot', 'interesting', 'look', 'french', 'filmmaker', 'suburban', 'mther', 'daughter', 'relationship', 'issues', 'there', 'also', 'group', 'adults', 'similar', 'issues', 'control', 'regular', 'group', 'who', 'dont', 'appear', 'be', 'different', 'then', 'daughter', 'globetrotting', 'away', 'suburbs..to', 'varying', 'locales', 'think', 'first', 'viewing', 'doubtful', 'american', 'director', 'makeup', 'way', 'shot', 'scenes..that', 'crossed', 'mind', 'way', 'french', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'more', 'apparent', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'issues', 'raised', 'failure', 'certain', 'sense', 'accomodate', 'two', 'scene', 'presences', 'demi', 'moore', 'miley', 'cyrus', 'DEmi', 'i', 'believe', 'filming', 'was', 'therapy', 'problem..but', 'scenes', 'here', 'are', 'fully', 'realized..much', 'more', 'then', 'seductress', 'roles', 'reluctant', 'amour', 'more', 'role..and', 'miley', 'must', 'respond', 'scenes', 'demi..which', 'acting', 'chore', 'standpoint', 'director', 'here', 'accomodate.and', 'showcase', 'miley..and', 'i', 'believe', 'really', 'show', 'mother', 'side..and', 'really', 'constraine', 'dsince', 'what', 'viewers', 'expect..thats', 'why', 'casting', 'often', 'what', 'get', 'two', 'actresses', 'want', 'film', 'presence', 'make', 'film..i', ""'m"", 'kidding', 'im', 'glad', 'film', 'sets', 'stuff', 'doesnt', 'go', 'often', 'writing', 'set', 'ups', 'film', '9', '5..here', 'action', 'geared', 'nocturnal..the', 'talk', 'action', 'film', '9', '5..characters', 'who', 'live', 'whole', 'day', 'reason..the', 'adolescent', 'mind', 'pervasive..from', 'just', 'angle', 'even', 'girls', 'fight', 'lovers..and', 'betray', 'other..this', 'story', 'prolonged', 'adolescent..the', 'sleeping', 'bear', 'syndrome', 'action', 'up', 'detroit', 'chicago', 'france//the', 'models..beautifully', 'photographed..will', 'have', 'everyone', 'flocking', 'world', 'parisienne', 'fashions', 'lifestyle', 'gawk', 'take', 'photo..wonderfully', 'photographed', 'american', 'scenes', 'subway..the', 'early', 'shot', 'lifestyles', 'dont', 'match', 'paris', 'life', 'what', 'life', 'should', 'be', 'transitions', 'are', 'shot', 'film..did', 'find', 'scenes', 'few', 'places', 'director', 'overboard', 'especially', 'ascene', 'class', 'apple..entertaining', 'film', 'tell', 'so', 'much', 'miley', 'cyrus..and', 'loves..and', 'battles', 'men', 'women..post', 'adolescent', 'life..and', 'demi', 'moore', 'maternal', 'star', '3', 'real', 'kids', 'i', 'think', 'off', 'real', 'good', 'mother', '..INdecent', 'Proposal', 'Disclosure', 'such', 'scenes', 'are', 'background', 'here', 'also', 'JUROR..here', 'have', 'maternal..the', '9', '5', 'persona..if', 'not', 'sunrise', 'sunset..and', 'different', 'scenes', 'way', 'europen', 'director', 'sets', 'up', 'lift', 'film', 'mundane', 'recall', 'music', 'video', 'kid..', 'voulez', 'vous', 'coucher', 'avec', 'moi', '..i', 'think', 'Quebec', 'different', 'quebec', 'french', 'quebecois', 'french..louisianna', 'french..here', 'have', 'parisienne', 'french..and', 'scenes', 'france..the', 'young', 'lifestyle', 'make', 'want', 'flock', 'youn', 'gpersons', 'here..']",N/A

They were just spliced together with no rhyme or reason.LOL chronicles one school year in the lives of Lola (Miley Cyrus; The Last Song, ""Hannah Montana"") and her gaggle of bubble gum Teen Beat friends.  They attend some unnamed high school whose population is only made up of the most absolutely beautiful teenagers on the planet and their days are spent in cliche filled montages set to a random pop song.  The girls are the best of friends with the minor exception with the school bad girl Post It (a tragically underused Ashley Green; The Twilight Saga, The Apparition); the boys all have long hair they constantly flip in a ""I don't care cause I'm a rebel bad boy whose actually a misunderstood good guy with a heart of gold"" way; everyone walks in slow motion. They have parties, or one party when Lola's Mom (a desperate for a role Demi Moore; Mr. Brooks, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle) goes out of town for a weekend.  They attend the Battle of the Bands, or A Band since we only see Chad's band(random Pretty Boy whose career will go no where except possibly rehab and a random Chris Brown assault charge) perform (badly), chat via Facebook, Twitter, and text about everything, and a quick, before you know it it's over like the rest of the pivotal moments in their lives trip to Paris all while navigating through the trials and tribulations of being a teenager (at least if your teen life is taken from any CW series of the last 16 years).Meanwhile, Lola's Mom has trials of her own juggling two men in her life; Lola's Dad (a tragically underused Thomas Jane; The Punisher, ""Hung"") and Hot Cop (a tragically underused Jay Hernandez; Hostel, crazy/beautiful).  All while doing her best to be Best Friend Mom Laureli Gilmore style.  That's the extent of her role.No character development, no point, one dimensional characters, and just an all around waste of time.  Normally I can find something that I liked in a box office flop (I Know Who Killed Me was a good horror movie despite the nay sayers) but I'm at a loss on this one. I'm thinking all the five star reviews are from family and friends of the filmmakers and rabid Miley fans who think she can do no wrong.

Obviously people haven't seen truly terrible productions. You have to go into this movie expecting it to be a bit of a risqu&eacute; teen chick-flick featuring none other than the infamous Miley Cyrus. I'm guessing this was Miley Cyrus's attempt at transitioning from Hannah Montana to a grown girl. It's a well-played move on her part to take this role. As it wasn't too 'adult', but definitely separated her from her sweet innocent image. Obviously, since this movie was made she's made an avid attempt at recreating herself. But during the time when this movie was made, I'm assuming the ENTIRE purpose of it was to bring Miley from little girl to grown teen woman in the eyes of the public. Did it work? I don't know.Miley's acting tends to follow her spirited personality in Hannah Montana. In this film you see a few serious scenes from her, but nothing that's going to really 'wow' you as a viewer and make you think she's definitely ready for more mature roles. In the film she plays the teenage daughter of Demi Moore. Her mother is concerned about Miley's character Lola losing her virginity. All the while all Lola really cares about is dating a guy she actually cares about.The film is... forgettable. I honestly watched it two months ago and am having trouble recalling enough of the film to write a thorough review. There was definitely nothing that stuck out as amazing or worthwhile. The storyline was predictable. The acting was mediocre. Nothing really shown brightly.Ironically enough in the film Lola's mother (Demi) is a pot smoker? It's such a weird additive to the film. I don't understand the point of it at all. If the film was targeted towards teen girls, I'm guessing this was a way of showing that no matter how strict Lola's mother may seem she's actually &#34;cool&#34; because she smokes weed? I think having Demi's character smoke pot was a very sad attempt at making her seem relatable to the kids. I mean- I'm not necessarily 'anti marijuana' but would I want my teen daughter watching a film where the mother is smoking pot? Heck no. That's a ridiculous example of parenting. If some mom wants to go out with her friends and have a good time occasionally- fine. And I don't necessarily have anything against parents who responsibly smoke. But I sure as heck don't want my child thinking that pot-smoking parents are cool. Just like I don't want them thinking cigarette-smoking or drinking is cool. I was really offended to see that involved in the film at all. And I think a lot of other parents would be disappointed as well.Overall, I don't know who'd I'd recommend this film for. Older teens 17 to 19 in age? It's a bit too 'young' for them. But it's a bit too maturely-written for anyone under 16. And most adults are bound to find it boring and stupidly scripted. I want to give this film more than 2 stars. But nothing made it magnificent. Is it a one star movie? No. It's not TERRIBLE. But it's certainly not memorable. It's barely decent. I like both Miley and Demi. But participation in this film was not one of their greatest choices.",2,"Too Teen-Oriented For Adults, But Too Maturely-Themed For Adolescents",1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,3168,"['Was', 'movie', 'terrible', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'riotously', 'earned', 'so', 'many', '1', 'star', 'votes', 'Obviously', 'people', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'truly', 'terrible', 'productions', 'have', 'go', 'movie', 'expecting', 'be', 'bit', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'teen', 'chick-flick', 'featuring', 'none', 'other', 'infamous', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'was', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', 'attempt', 'transitioning', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'grown', 'girl', 'well-played', 'move', 'part', 'take', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', ""'adult"", 'definitely', 'separated', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'image', 'Obviously', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'made', 'avid', 'attempt', 'recreating', 'time', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'ENTIRE', 'purpose', 'was', 'bring', 'Miley', 'little', 'girl', 'grown', 'teen', 'woman', 'eyes', 'public', 'Did', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.Miley', 'acting', 'tends', 'follow', 'spirited', 'personality', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'film', 'see', 'few', 'serious', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'going', 'really', ""'wow"", 'viewer', 'make', 'think', 'definitely', 'ready', 'more', 'mature', 'roles', 'film', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'mother', 'concerned', 'Miley', 'character', 'Lola', 'losing', 'virginity', 'Lola', 'really', 'dating', 'guy', 'actually', 'about.The', 'film', 'forgettable', 'honestly', 'watched', 'two', 'months', 'ago', 'am', 'having', 'trouble', 'recalling', 'enough', 'film', 'write', 'thorough', 'review', 'was', 'definitely', 'nothing', 'stuck', 'out', 'amazing', 'worthwhile', 'storyline', 'was', 'predictable', 'acting', 'was', 'mediocre', 'Nothing', 'really', 'shown', 'brightly.Ironically', 'enough', 'film', 'Lola', 'mother', 'Demi', 'pot', 'smoker', 'such', 'weird', 'additive', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'targeted', 'towards', 'teen', 'girls', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'was', 'way', 'showing', 'matter', 'how', 'strict', 'Lola', 'mother', 'may', 'seem', 'actually', '34', 'cool', '34', 'weed', 'think', 'having', 'Demi', 'character', 'smoke', 'pot', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'attempt', 'making', 'seem', 'relatable', 'kids', 'mean-', ""'m"", 'not', 'necessarily', ""'anti"", 'marijuana', 'would', 'want', 'teen', 'daughter', 'watching', 'film', 'where', 'mother', 'smoking', 'pot', 'Heck', 'ridiculous', 'example', 'parenting', 'mom', 'go', 'out', 'friends', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'occasionally-', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'have', 'anything', 'parents', 'who', 'responsibly', 'smoke', 'sure', 'heck', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'child', 'thinking', 'pot-smoking', 'parents', 'are', 'cool', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'thinking', 'cigarette-smoking', 'drinking', 'cool', 'was', 'really', 'offended', 'see', 'involved', 'film', 'think', 'lot', 'other', 'parents', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', 'well.Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', ""'d"", ""'d"", 'recommend', 'film', 'Older', '17', '19', 'age', 'bit', 'too', ""'young"", 'bit', 'too', 'maturely-written', 'anyone', '16', 'most', 'adults', 'are', 'bound', 'find', 'boring', 'stupidly', 'scripted', 'want', 'give', 'film', 'more', '2', 'stars', 'nothing', 'made', 'magnificent', 'one', 'star', 'movie', 'No', 'not', 'TERRIBLE', 'certainly', 'not', 'memorable', 'barely', 'decent', 'Miley', 'Demi', 'participation', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'greatest', 'choices']",N/A
