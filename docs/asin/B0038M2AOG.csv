But please if you're new to the show listen to this warning.You MUST watch this show in order to get the most out of every episode. Most television shows I feel you can skip some episodes and still derive a great quantity of joy from subsequent episodes but Mad Men stands apart. It is a show that I think in such a masterful way build on each previous episode. And if you miss an episode you're going to miss the reasons why certain characters act the way they do, talk the way they do and do the things that they do.For example I missed season two finale the carousel and went on to season three and I was like what the heck is going on I didn't realize it until I finished all of season three and was like something was off the whole season seemed a little bit tweaked as they were building on things that I had missed ( it is of note that the carousel was the one of the most amazing season finales that a person could miss but somehow I pulled that off I can be a bonehead sometimes)For instance Roger Sterling has so much back story and is not even a real major player in the show but if you miss some episodes you missed the buildup to his character. Don Draper is a Shining example of someone that is touched upon and built upon in (almost) EVERY episode.So that is my warning watch every episode of Mad Men from start to finish in order.I'm Chuck Bittner from AskACapper dot com And I approve of this message!PS watching madmen in high definition is a must that's why recommend only watching it that way.

This is the season of Don's discontent -- indeed, his comeuppance, if you will -- and as the season opens we find him living in a seedy Greenwich Village apartment, where his rendevous with the ladies end all too often in rebuffs rather than ravishings.  On the work front, Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce has all the trappings of success.  They have nice offices, a corral of secretaries, and a big client list.  Don is being interviewed by a magazine asking the question ""Who is Don Draper?"" and further on into the season, we see him accepting a Cleo for his talents.  The only problem is, he's drunk when he's accepting it.  In fact, he's drunk most of the time.  Dead drunk, and his decisions and fine-honed genius with words suffer for it.Of course, being Don, he looks good.  Hard to believe a man can drink that much and still not show the wages of sin.  But as the season progresses, we see him losing his grip more and more, on the business as well as the personal front.  He blows up at clients, neglects his children, and uses his women to get what he thinks he wants.  At the same time, he is watching himself, from a distance, deconstruct.  He starts keeping a journal and swims every day to clear his mind.  You keep thinking he's going to get a grip on it.  He has to.  He's Don Draper.The supporting staff is suffering too, all the with exception of Peggy, who seems to have really come into her own this season.  She is confident, perky, and looks great.  She's even dressing the part.  Joan Holloway is given more to do this season, thankfully, and her character only gets more intriguing.  There's really no telling what Joan can pull off, because no matter what happens to her, she keeps on going.  As for Betty Draper, she isn't present too often, but when she is, she is still very much the Mom you love to hate, and she doesn't seem to have learned a thing.I can't reveal too much more without spoiling the season.  In fact, I probably should have put spoiler alerts in the beginning of this, but I don't think I've ruined anything for anybody.

1330461,A106016KSI0YQ,B0038M2AOG,Jay Dickson,"[4, 4]","The fourth season of MAD MEN, the best American dramatic television show of the last decade, begins with Don Draper (Jon Hamm) and his ex-wife Betty (January Jones) both allowed what seems to be a fresh start: newly divorced from Don, Betty has married the handsome politico Henry Francis, while Don has started a new upstart advertising firm headquartered in the Time-Life Building with his old bosses at Sterling-Cooper. Yet neither Betty nor Don finds themselves able this season to make the break with the past they might have hoped: Betty insists on keeping her children in the old home in Ossining, while Don's shame over his divorce brings him further and further down as he drinks more and more heavily, as his new firm struggles to find its feet.MAD MEN is so much better written (and filmed, and acted, and designed) than other American television shows today that it seems almost wrong to complain, but even so the fourth has been the weakest of the seasons so far. Individually some of the episodes are absolutely first-rate (particularly ""the Rejected,"" a superb episode focusing on the aftermath of Don's drunken amorous tumble with one of his secretaries), the characters' cynicism and sourness begins to wear a bit, particularly in the case of Betty Draper Francis, whom series creator Matthew Weiner seems to have it in for. Even if Betty's constant bullying fights with her daughter Sally (the excellent child actor Kiernan Shipka) are realistic, they wear out their welcome pretty much, as does Don's constant nastiness towards his creative staff at the new firm. The introduction this season of two sunny major new characters, a research specialist (the warm and intensely likable Cara Buono) and a beautiful French-Canadian secretary (Jessica Pare), is a tremendous help, but even so you can't help hoping Weiner decides to take the character of Betty in an entirely new direction because it seems to be bringing the whole series down (and January Jones's one-note acting in the role isn't much help).The DVD set is perhaps the most horribly designed of all the series' badly designed DVD sets (it's very difficult to reassemble after you've opened it up, and the plastic cases the DVDs snap into keep coming ungummed). It comes with some fine features including a study of bourgeois divorce in America in the 1960s; there's lots of commentary, too, although be warned that when Matt Weiner is joined by his directors and editors and advisers he almost completely drowns them out with his own ideas, and they are of course too cowed for the most part to get a word in edgewise. (Fortunately, he has much intelligent to say.) One of the nicest surprises of this set is that John Slattery's commentary for the episodes he directs is much more thoughtful and sober than his wearying fratboyish commentary turns as an actor in other seasons.",4,The chances for a fresh start,1305504000,"05 16, 2011",2011,2858,"['fourth', 'season', 'MAD', 'MEN', 'best', 'American', 'dramatic', 'television', 'show', 'last', 'decade', 'Don', 'Draper', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'ex-wife', 'Betty', 'January', 'Jones', 'allowed', 'what', 'be', 'fresh', 'start', 'newly', 'divorced', 'Don', 'Betty', 'married', 'handsome', 'politico', 'Henry', 'Francis', 'Don', 'started', 'new', 'upstart', 'advertising', 'firm', 'headquartered', 'Time-Life', 'Building', 'old', 'bosses', 'Sterling-Cooper', 'Betty', 'Don', 'able', 'season', 'make', 'break', 'past', 'might', 'have', 'hoped', 'Betty', 'insists', 'keeping', 'children', 'old', 'home', 'Ossining', 'Don', 'shame', 'divorce', 'further', 'further', 'down', 'more', 'more', 'heavily', 'new', 'firm', 'find', 'feet.MAD', 'MEN', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'written', 'filmed', 'acted', 'designed', 'other', 'American', 'television', 'shows', 'today', 'almost', 'wrong', 'complain', 'even', 'fourth', 'been', 'weakest', 'seasons', 'so', 'far', 'Individually', 'episodes', 'are', 'absolutely', 'first-rate', 'particularly', 'Rejected', 'superb', 'episode', 'focusing', 'aftermath', 'Don', 'drunken', 'amorous', 'tumble', 'one', 'secretaries', 'characters', 'cynicism', 'sourness', 'begins', 'wear', 'bit', 'particularly', 'case', 'Betty', 'Draper', 'Francis', 'whom', 'series', 'creator', 'Matthew', 'Weiner', 'have', 'Even', 'Betty', 'constant', 'bullying', 'fights', 'daughter', 'Sally', 'excellent', 'child', 'actor', 'Kiernan', 'Shipka', 'are', 'realistic', 'wear', 'out', 'welcome', 'pretty', 'much', 'Don', 'constant', 'nastiness', 'creative', 'staff', 'new', 'firm', 'introduction', 'season', 'two', 'sunny', 'major', 'new', 'characters', 'research', 'specialist', 'warm', 'intensely', 'likable', 'Cara', 'Buono', 'beautiful', 'French-Canadian', 'secretary', 'Jessica', 'Pare', 'tremendous', 'help', 'even', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'hoping', 'Weiner', 'take', 'character', 'Betty', 'entirely', 'new', 'direction', 'be', 'bringing', 'whole', 'series', 'down', 'January', 'Jones', 'one-note', 'acting', 'role', ""n't"", 'much', 'help', '.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'perhaps', 'most', 'horribly', 'designed', 'series', 'badly', 'designed', 'DVD', 'sets', 'very', 'difficult', 'reassemble', ""'ve"", 'opened', 'up', 'plastic', 'cases', 'DVDs', 'snap', 'keep', 'coming', 'ungummed', 'fine', 'features', 'including', 'study', 'bourgeois', 'divorce', 'America', '1960s', 'lots', 'commentary', 'too', 'be', 'warned', 'when', 'Matt', 'Weiner', 'joined', 'directors', 'editors', 'advisers', 'almost', 'completely', 'drowns', 'out', 'own', 'ideas', 'are', 'course', 'too', 'cowed', 'most', 'part', 'get', 'word', 'edgewise', 'Fortunately', 'much', 'intelligent', 'say', 'One', 'nicest', 'surprises', 'set', 'John', 'Slattery', 'commentary', 'episodes', 'much', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'sober', 'wearying', 'fratboyish', 'commentary', 'actor', 'other', 'seasons']",N/A

My son told me  how good Mad Men was and said that I would probably enjoy it. The first season took us a while to enjoy but once we began watching the 2nd season and the 3rd season, we really wanted more. In Season 4 we see the main characters start their own company and come together to support one another. It feels as if they are finally working together. We had not felt that Don Draper's character was very likeable but in this season we discover a lot more about why he is like he is. He has to deal with more loss and we see him go through the motions of grief. Peter's character seems to soften a little and in this season, his wife is pregnant, and there are moments when this pregnancy is seen with a backdrop of Peggy's pregnancy. Peggy and Don have some fascinating conversation and although we sense they will never be good friends, they are somehow supportive of one another, and each others' quirks. The dynamics between them, boss and employee are very interesting and show really good writing. The best scene we think (not to be a spoiler) is when Don seems to be having a real panic attack. It was so good. I had not thought of him as an actor before, he always seemed so &#34;wooden&#34; but this scene towards the end of the season shows a depth to his character and he opens up his &#34;soul&#34; to a new woman (and there have been many as we all know!!!!)

I hate to give away much but this season also has my favorite moment were Draper's secretary makes an awkward exit during a critical meeting. The firm loses their biggest account and when the firm can't get arrested, Don does a Jerry Macguire; writing a manifesto dismissing ever bringing in more cigarette advertising. Draper doesn't tell anyone else in the firm that he pays the New York Times to publish the manifesto as a full page ad. Romantically, Dr. Faye Miller is a perfect match for Don except for one obvious fault, she's not 25. A couple of other notable visits from old characters: Duck Phillips and Freddy Rumsfeld return in grand awkwardness. I really wish that they would bring back Salvatore Romano, the original art director.

The other seasons had nifty unique boxes, this one is the quad fold out plastic, which is fine for the innards. It is the cardboard sleeve without a bottom that bothers me. As soon as I took it out the quad the dvd holder slid out and hit the floor. I have other movies like this and they do the same thing. You take it off the shelf and the DVD holder falls out.How I have fixed this is take a business card and cut it in half (business cards work well, being heavy stock). I lay the business card that has been cut in half (longways) and line it up with the bottom lip with the business card laying out of the sleeve but snug against the bottom, to create a sort of hinge. Then I fold the card back towards the front to make a bottom so to speak for the DVD's not to fall out. Then I put a piece if tape over the closed end on the backside so it doesn't look too shoddy.Update, went to B&N; and saw the DVD's in a different, nicer box.

This is primarily because there are so many ups and downs in almsot every episode that at some point you say to yourself ""how much worse can it get for Don"" or towards the end of the show ""wow--it seems like things have turned around in a real positive way for Don.""The show continues to address many of the difficult issues of the 1960's in a very sensitive and smart way.  The two that are addressed most prominently are smoking and racism.  Smoking is addressed and dealt with in terms of the account management at the agency. I won't spoil the episodes but suffice it to say there is a good episode where they are forced to determine what sort of clients they represent moving forward.  In terms of racism, this is addressed throughout but most prominently towards the end by Betty and her housekeeper of many years.The new firm goes through many ups and downs in this season. They celebrate some successes together and definitely many failures--some of which take them right to edge of the cliff.  To see if they fall over it, you'll have to watch the season and find out.

In line with the times, smoking is occasional, not as all-consuming as in the 1st Season.This season is more brooding and introspective, with some much needed hilarious black humor thrown in as counterbalance. Don visits his namesake's wife Anna, with whom he has become very close, but not intimate - Don's only true friend who knows and loves him as he is. Faced with terrible news, we see a different and more human Don who now thinks and reflects, instead of constantly projecting an impenetrable facade.The fate of Sterling Cooper Draper Price teeters, as always, from one crisis to the next. But there is a different feeling in this Season, bringing it back from the doldrums of Season 3.Specifically worth mentioning is Randee Heller's re-appearance as Cooper's ex secretary Miss Blankenship, hauled out of mothballs to replace yet another of Don's fired secretaries. Uncharacteristically, Don tolerates her. Her tactlessness and pithy comments are a breath of fresh air. There is a scene involving her removal from the office (no spoilers) that had me laughing out loud. Refreshing asides to lighten sombre moods, temper tantrums and the like.More and more, this series belongs to Don, Peggy and Joan. Pete's slimy character just gets more unlikeable, although he does take the fall for Don. One wonders how the vain, cold and superficial Betty, could ever have ignited Don's passion, let alone Henry's. Little wonder that Don played the field.Roger is unravelling, probably due to his recent folly, while Cooper wanders around aimlessly, lost without his own office in which to cogitate. Rich Sommer's Harry Crane, despite featuring in almost every episode, is unmemorable. Lane Price becomes less stuffy, dropping a clanger when his father visits. But young Sally, having proven herself in the previous season, is masterful at conveying a casualty of divorce.The excessive drinking in previous seasons is more credible now - the drinkers are drunk, hungover, maudlin, which is more believable than their previously sober personae.Keep watching!",5,Perfect balance between dark and light,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,2112,"['usual', 'shenanigans', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'Mad', 'Men', 'line', 'times', 'smoking', 'occasional', 'not', 'as', 'all-consuming', '1st', 'Season.This', 'season', 'more', 'brooding', 'introspective', 'much', 'needed', 'hilarious', 'black', 'humor', 'thrown', 'counterbalance', 'Don', 'namesake', 'wife', 'Anna', 'whom', 'become', 'very', 'close', 'not', 'intimate', 'Don', 'only', 'true', 'friend', 'who', 'Faced', 'terrible', 'news', 'see', 'different', 'more', 'human', 'Don', 'who', 'now', 'instead', 'constantly', 'projecting', 'impenetrable', 'facade.The', 'fate', 'Sterling', 'Cooper', 'Draper', 'Price', 'teeters', 'always', 'one', 'crisis', 'next', 'different', 'feeling', 'Season', 'bringing', 'back', 'doldrums', 'Season', '3.Specifically', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Randee', 'Heller', 're-appearance', 'Cooper', 'ex', 'secretary', 'Miss', 'Blankenship', 'hauled', 'mothballs', 'replace', 'yet', 'Don', 'fired', 'secretaries', 'Uncharacteristically', 'Don', 'tactlessness', 'pithy', 'comments', 'are', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'scene', 'involving', 'removal', 'office', 'spoilers', 'had', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'Refreshing', 'asides', 'lighten', 'sombre', 'moods', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'like.More', 'more', 'series', 'Don', 'Peggy', 'Joan', 'Pete', 'slimy', 'character', 'just', 'more', 'unlikeable', 'take', 'fall', 'Don', 'One', 'how', 'vain', 'cold', 'superficial', 'Betty', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'ignited', 'Don', 'passion', 'let', 'alone', 'Henry', 'Little', 'wonder', 'Don', 'played', 'field.Roger', 'unravelling', 'probably', 'due', 'recent', 'folly', 'Cooper', 'wanders', 'around', 'aimlessly', 'lost', 'own', 'office', 'cogitate', 'Rich', 'Sommer', 'Harry', 'Crane', 'featuring', 'almost', 'episode', 'unmemorable', 'Lane', 'Price', 'less', 'stuffy', 'dropping', 'clanger', 'when', 'father', 'visits', 'young', 'Sally', 'having', 'proven', 'previous', 'season', 'masterful', 'conveying', 'casualty', 'divorce.The', 'excessive', 'drinking', 'previous', 'seasons', 'more', 'credible', 'now', 'drinkers', 'are', 'drunk', 'hungover', 'maudlin', 'more', 'believable', 'previously', 'sober', 'personae.Keep', 'watching']",N/A

He has a variety of female relationships while Betty has chosen to try to continue her life as is with another man.  Neither is quite content, Don does miss the family relationship he has lost and Betty is no freer and happier than she was before.  Her life is stagnating in a pitiful direction.  She is so unhappy.  Don is luckier in that he has an ability to travel and socialize with people at work and in the world.  The company tries to move on and develop a solid clientele but old habits and the past seem to keep up with the group at every turn.  The elder men of the company are stagnating and somewhat harmful to the company as they have developed habits that don't quite help the development of a new company.  The younger employees, Peggy and Pete, are the people who seem to be creating the most work and are freer than their elders to relate to a changing 60s world.

And while ""Mad Men"" has been accused of being too detached in One, Two and Three (all style and no substance) - this Season has seen the hugely watchable cast and their slowly fleshed-out characters all get to really shine. The writing is brilliant, it's very funny, it's effortlessly chic and well dressed - but it's also very poignant and touching too. It's a job well done. But I'd like to talk more about the PICTURE QUALITY...Filmed entirely on 35mm stock (as HIGH DEF as it gets) - ""Mad Men Season Four"" has picture quality that rivals benchmark stuff like ""Band Of Brothers"" and ""The Pacific"". No episode is ever less than beautiful and at times - absolutely breathtaking. Episode 7 is a good example - called ""The Suitcase"" (a Samsonite advert campaign dominates the program), it's where Don and Peggy get really close and Don's drinking is really getting out of hand. There are scenes in it when your jaw drops to the floor at the clarity. You notice the luminescent Sixties glow of garish ashtrays on tables, the old labels on bottles of Canadian Club, the shape and colour textures of boxes of tissues on toilet cisterns, the speckled weave of finely tailored suits - the detail is awesome.There's also some great extras - one in particular about the advert campaign for the Ford ""Mustang"" car which is pure Don Draper.Our home has taken the plunge and bought all 4 Seasons on BLU RAY rather than DVD - and I have to say they're keepers.""Mad Men"" may be cheaper on DVD - but don't be tempted - BLU RAY is the only way to see this exceptionally classy TV show.",5,Best Season So Far And Truly Astonishing High-Def Picture Quality on BLU RAY,1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,1756,"['***', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'IS', 'THE', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'ISSUE', '***Most', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'fact', 'probably', 'Best', 'Season', 'so', 'far', 'series', 'been', 'superlative', 'start', 'Mad', 'Men', 'been', 'accused', 'being', 'too', 'detached', 'One', 'Two', 'Three', 'style', 'substance', 'Season', 'seen', 'hugely', 'watchable', 'cast', 'slowly', 'fleshed-out', 'characters', 'get', 'really', 'shine', 'writing', 'brilliant', 'very', 'funny', 'effortlessly', 'chic', 'well', 'dressed', 'also', 'very', 'poignant', 'touching', 'too', 'job', 'well', 'done', ""'d"", 'like', 'talk', 'more', 'PICTURE', 'QUALITY', 'Filmed', 'entirely', '35mm', 'stock', 'HIGH', 'DEF', 'Mad', 'Men', 'Season', 'Four', 'picture', 'quality', 'benchmark', 'stuff', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'Pacific', 'episode', 'ever', 'less', 'beautiful', 'times', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'Episode', '7', 'good', 'example', 'called', 'Suitcase', 'Samsonite', 'advert', 'campaign', 'program', 'where', 'Don', 'Peggy', 'get', 'really', 'close', 'Don', 'drinking', 'really', 'getting', 'hand', 'are', 'scenes', 'when', 'jaw', 'drops', 'floor', 'clarity', 'notice', 'luminescent', 'Sixties', 'glow', 'garish', 'ashtrays', 'tables', 'old', 'labels', 'bottles', 'Canadian', 'Club', 'shape', 'colour', 'textures', 'boxes', 'tissues', 'toilet', 'cisterns', 'speckled', 'weave', 'finely', 'tailored', 'suits', 'detail', 'also', 'great', 'extras', 'one', 'particular', 'advert', 'campaign', 'Ford', 'Mustang', 'car', 'pure', 'Don', 'Draper.Our', 'home', 'taken', 'plunge', 'bought', '4', 'Seasons', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'rather', 'DVD', 'have', 'say', ""'re"", 'keepers', 'Mad', 'Men', 'may', 'be', 'cheaper', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'tempted', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'only', 'way', 'see', 'exceptionally', 'classy', 'TV', 'show']",N/A

It's seriously one of the best shows I've ever seen. Season 4 is amazing. The season revolves around the struggles with the new agency, Sterling Cooper Draper Price. Meanwhile, Don is coping with his divorce, Peggy is trying to figure out what she wants out of life, Joan and Roger have a hard time denying their feelings for each other, and Betty Draper...excuse me, Betty Francis...is nastier and more vicious than she has ever been.

As the new millennium keeps disappointing us, TV shows set on the 50's and the 60's (once a rarity) keep growing in numbers. Many have tried and failed. MAD MEN tried and closed the deal. And have been doing so for 5 seasons now.Meet Don Draper (Jon Ham), a Madison Avenue water-walker (and based on the real life ad men Draper Daniels and Rosser Reeves). He is an enigma wrapped in a mystery. He is brilliant and secretive. He wants to keep walking the tight rope with no safety net. And definitely no contract. He is a chain-smoking, hard liqueur guzzling, womanizing alpha male. He is a loving father of three, married to a picture-perfect ex model. He has it all. And yet he cannot find peace. Because he learned early on that the world is always yawning at your heels, eager to yank everything you love away.From bursting with joie-de-vivre Roger Sterling (hilarious John Slattery) and ever scheming Pete Cambell (baby-faced Vincent Kartheiser) to the gorgeous women (such as barbie January Jones and refined Jessica Par&eacute; as his first and second wife, respectively), the cast is one perfect pick after another. And the writing is brilliant, reproducing the tastes and smells and nuisances of the era around Camelot, while drawing you in to the personal stories of characters polished yet inevitably flawed.The 50's and the 60's were before my time so it is not nostalgia that makes me love the show. Yes, I find the era mesmerizing and (probably undeservingly) less complicated. If nothing else, though, back then they knew how to dress. Women looked feminine and men looked manly. You see January Jones on the red carpet, for example, all dressed up and groomed for a Hollywood function - and that modern image cannot hold a candle to herself dressed for everyday(!) life in the 50's. When did we loose it? When did we decide men should stop wearing suits and hats and women should start wearing sweat-suits outside the house? I, for one, blame the hippies!This is one of the best TV shows ever and this box-set includes season 4. There is one more. Season 6 is eminent whereas season 7 has already been green-lighted. As I have said again before, good TV is best watched on DVD. Make weekends out of it. It is much more enjoyable to watch an entire season in a couple of days than having to wait week(s) between episodes. And (quite ironically, in this case), you will not have to suffer the...commercials.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5,HAMS WORTH FIGHTING FOR,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,2563,"['When', 'things', 'get', 'bad', 'tend', 'look', 'past', 'bleaker', 'future', 'further', 'back', 'search', 'comfort', 'new', 'millennium', 'disappointing', 'TV', 'shows', 'set', '50', '60', 'once', 'rarity', 'keep', 'growing', 'numbers', 'Many', 'have', 'tried', 'failed', 'MAD', 'MEN', 'tried', 'closed', 'deal', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'so', '5', 'seasons', 'now.Meet', 'Don', 'Draper', 'Jon', 'Ham', 'Madison', 'Avenue', 'water-walker', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'ad', 'men', 'Draper', 'Daniels', 'Rosser', 'Reeves', 'enigma', 'wrapped', 'mystery', 'brilliant', 'secretive', 'keep', 'walking', 'tight', 'rope', 'safety', 'net', 'definitely', 'contract', 'chain-smoking', 'hard', 'liqueur', 'guzzling', 'womanizing', 'alpha', 'male', 'loving', 'father', 'three', 'married', 'picture-perfect', 'ex', 'model', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'peace', 'learned', 'early', 'world', 'always', 'yawning', 'heels', 'eager', 'yank', 'everything', 'love', 'bursting', 'joie-de-vivre', 'Roger', 'Sterling', 'hilarious', 'John', 'Slattery', 'ever', 'scheming', 'Pete', 'Cambell', 'baby-faced', 'Vincent', 'Kartheiser', 'gorgeous', 'women', 'such', 'barbie', 'January', 'Jones', 'refined', 'Jessica', 'Par', 'eacute', 'first', 'second', 'wife', 'respectively', 'cast', 'one', 'perfect', 'pick', 'writing', 'brilliant', 'reproducing', 'tastes', 'smells', 'nuisances', 'era', 'Camelot', 'drawing', 'personal', 'stories', 'characters', 'polished', 'yet', 'inevitably', '50', '60', 'were', 'time', 'not', 'nostalgia', 'love', 'show', 'Yes', 'find', 'era', 'mesmerizing', 'probably', 'undeservingly', 'less', 'complicated', 'nothing', 'else', 'back', 'then', 'knew', 'how', 'dress', 'Women', 'looked', 'feminine', 'men', 'looked', 'manly', 'see', 'January', 'Jones', 'red', 'carpet', 'example', 'dressed', 'up', 'groomed', 'Hollywood', 'function', 'modern', 'image', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'herself', 'dressed', 'everyday', 'life', '50', 'When', 'did', 'loose', 'When', 'did', 'decide', 'men', 'should', 'stop', 'wearing', 'suits', 'hats', 'women', 'should', 'start', 'wearing', 'sweat-suits', 'house', 'one', 'hippies', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'shows', 'ever', 'box-set', 'season', '4', 'one', 'more', 'Season', '6', 'eminent', 'whereas', 'season', '7', 'already', 'been', 'green-lighted', 'have', 'said', 'again', 'before', 'good', 'TV', 'best', 'watched', 'DVD', 'Make', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'entire', 'season', 'couple', 'days', 'having', 'wait', 'week', 'episodes', 'quite', 'ironically', 'case', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'suffer', 'commercials.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

1330488,A8IHLMGDIOK8L,B0038M2AOG,Pekinman,"[1, 2]","Season 4 of Mad Men has taken a quantum leap over Season 3 when it comes to intense and intelligent story lines, beautifully scripted and brilliantly acted.  Jon Hamm has become, finally, a great actor in this show.  In the past he was hamstrung by the character's current dilemma which centered around the telling of his sad past.  That, along with establishing, and pruning, the other main characters and watching them bud, kept the stew on simmer for 3 years.  In Season 4 the pot boils over and it is wonderful to behold these main characters un-peeling the layers of their personalities before us.  This is one of the elements that makes this show an outstanding television drama, one of the greats.I don't have cable or satellite and broadcast no longer exists, so I had to wait until the dvds came out last week.  I wondered what it would be like without some of the old mainstays like Paul Kinsey, who I hated as a character but I guess we were supposed to, and the old Sterling Cooper office staff.  I needn't have been concerned.  The new Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce offices are even more interesting because they were decorated at the start of the Op-Art craze which began in the early 60s as desirable and chic for homes and offices.  Roger Stirling's new office is outrageous, a fore-echo of some of the sets you will remember from the original Star Trek or even 2001: A Space Odyssey.I love Don's bachelor apartment in the Village.  I don't think its squalid at all, it was New York City gothic; dark, noisy and typical of the times.  Now Don's place is probably an over-priced condo, painted off -white and full of designer bounce.I love Roger.  He's such a rat but John Slater makes you love him.  He's suddenly growing old after this season, losing American Tobacco, losing Joan... he had bags under his eyes in his last scene, very sad.  But he'll be back!  I miss his daughter, played by Elizabeth Rice.  Hope they bring her back again after she divorces that gay man that she married on the weekend following JFK's assassination.I like all of the new characters, especially Jay Ferguson's oddball art director Stan Rizzo.  He's a perfect foil for Elisabeth Moss's Peggy Olson.  Stan has many facets besides being goofy and quick off the mark with clever retributions.  Stan is the prototype for the masculine (he's hunky in a chunky way) yet sensitive, as in vibes, urban man.  He's probably gay but not as obvious as poor old Sal Romano.  Joyce, Peggy's lesbian friend, has a wry ironic twist to her face which keeps her from being simply a smug village suffragette.  I'm not sure about Peggy's new boyfriend, though, Abe I think his name is.  She's having great sex though, which is what she wanted.  I can't help wondering if Peggy will go for one of Joyce's galpals she keeps presenting to Peggy.  That's one of the minor cliffhangers for Season 5 to resolve.  I won't miss Dr Faye Miller.  It was right that Don should cut her loose, there was something automaton-esque about her.  No heart, just neurosis.  And Bethany was too young for Don.  Megan is perfect for him.All thirteen episodes are first rate, A+, and that hadn't been the case in the first 3 seasons which wavered wildly in the quality of the scripts.  Old characters who we liked, like Francine Carlson and even Midge, come back for a scene.  Poor Midge, remember Don's first village romance that started the series off, is now down and out, but I won't give out any more spoilers about events that take place.  Even rotten old Duck Phillips returns for one last drunken turn.There isn't as much comedy in Season 4, no fat jokes or leering tribes of junior execs zeroing in on the new secretary.This season is extremely adult, dramatic and moving.  The music is as great as ever and the sets are evolving with the times.  We are now done with 1964 with Don triumphant, and beautifully in love with a wonderful woman and poor old Betty spitting nails.  She got just what she wanted.  I have to say I love the way Betty insists on seeing a child psychiatrist.  She's not nuts, nor is she a hopelessly embittered little bitch.  She's evolving too and I started to see some of her early vulnerable sweetness again in the last episode of this season.  I didn't hate her like I have done for the past 3 years anyway, though she's thoroughly obnoxious through most of the Season 4  shows as well.  And Henry is turning out to be something of a fraud, we could'a told her that.  What a class A creep that guy is.  I mean seducing a 6-month pregnant married woman!  He's scum and there doesn't appear to be much depth to him.  I think maybe, I  hope, we've seen the last of that character.  Next time we see Betty she'll probably be living in elegant squalor in her father's house, like Grey Gardens in better days.In spite of the wrenching stories being told in Season 4 it ends on a very high note of love and absolution.  All is not perfect, though.  Bert Cooper has a snit fit and stomps out, but he'll be back.  The show is greatly enhanced by the presence of Robert Morse.  There is much to look forward to with Season 5, and beyond.",5,Best Season yet.,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,5121,"['Season', '4', 'Mad', 'Men', 'taken', 'quantum', 'leap', 'Season', '3', 'when',

1330492,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0038M2AOG,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 3]","One of the most time-honored movie cliches involves the inevitable success that follows starting a new venture.  A hero or heroine opens the movie in a soul-crushing job or relationship and struggles to break free.  Invariably the movie includes a heartwarming montage of taking the first steps in the new venture - set to inspiring music.  The movie then closes with our hero(ine) triumphant, reinforcing the notion that simply following your heart will result in financial or romantic success (often both).Season 4 of AMC's ""Mad Men"" was set up for just such a cliche.  Not only was our hero, Don Draper (Jon Hamm), divorced from the icy, brittle Betty (January Jones), he had fled the confines of Sterling Cooper for the plucky start-up, Sterling Cooper Draper Price.But Season 4 includes nary a montage and (thankfully) refuses to tie everything up in a shiny happy bow.Season 4 sees our favorite bunch of boozers and philanderers coping with dizzying change.  Not everyone is prepared.  And these changes come fast and furious.  As crises are wont to do, they pile on.  The discombobulation comes from more than just the immediate lives of the cast - this season is set in 1965, a year where the counterculture made great strides toward the mainstream at the expense of rigidity of the Eisenhower years.  Vietnam, civil rights, and feminism - each unsettling forces for a Manhattan advertising agency - loomed on the horizon.All in all, there is plenty to keep the viewer entertained during these razor-sharp episodes.  Indeed, so much is crammed into this season that the finale feels more disappointing than usual (that, along with the news that Season 5 won't be out until 2012).

But it's really Dr. Faye Miller who drives this season.  Her character foreshadows the powerful educated, confident, assertive woman that will likely be a force as Mad Men transitions to the late 60s.  We all thought it was Peggy who has been making this transformation in front of our eyes, but Dr. Miller is already there.There are some other ""modern women"" starting to evolve in this season: Joyce, who works for LIFE magazine and Stefanie who goes to Berkeley.  However, it's Dr. Miller who commands the attention of the SCDP employees and eventually Don.  She has to adjust to get respect - like wearing a wedding ring but, like so many others, she eventually falls for Don.  That's likely given her occupation as a psychologist: we all know Draper is the most fascinating character in the office.I loved a later episode how the director parallels Dr. Miller with Sally's child psychiatrist and Don' new secretary.  Masterful writing and directing.Dr. Miller's overall fate is hinted in the subtext of the episode ""The Rejected,"" but it's still much more complex than that.  Highly educated women in a world still dominated by men have made many sacrifices to get to the top.  Admittedly, it's impossible for me to relate to that.  But her circumstance is metaphor for the times and even today.  We root for her character, even more than Peggy.  I stopped rooting for Don a while ago.  In that sense, I found Dr. Miller's fate only semi-tragic, but for various reasons that I don't want to write as to avoid revealing too many spoilers.I hope the writers of Mad Men find a way to feature Dr. Faye Miller in Season 5; her character is what made this my favorite Mad Men season so far.",5,The tale of Dr. Faye Miller,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,1783,"['Yes', 'season', 'Don', 'Draper', 'low', 'points', 'adjust', 'divorced', 'life', 'really', 'Dr.', 'Faye', 'Miller', 'who', 'season', 'character', 'powerful', 'educated', 'confident', 'assertive', 'woman', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'force', 'Mad', 'Men', 'transitions', 'late', '60s', 'thought', 'was', 'Peggy', 'who', 'been', 'making', 'transformation', 'front', 'eyes', 'Dr.', 'Miller', 'already', 'are', 'other', 'modern', 'women', 'starting', 'evolve', 'season', 'Joyce', 'who', 'LIFE', 'magazine', 'Stefanie', 'who', 'Berkeley', 'However', 'Dr.', 'Miller', 'who', 'attention', 'SCDP', 'employees', 'eventually', 'Don', 'adjust', 'get', 'respect', 'wearing', 'wedding', 'ring', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'eventually', 'Don', 'likely', 'given', 'occupation', 'psychologist', 'know', 'Draper', 'most', 'fascinating', 'character', 'office.I', 'loved', 'later', 'episode', 'how', 'director', 'parallels', 'Dr.', 'Miller', 'Sally', 'child', 'psychiatrist', 'Don', 'new', 'secretary', 'Masterful', 'writing', 'directing.Dr', 'Miller', 'overall', 'fate', 'hinted', 'subtext', 'episode', 'Rejected', 'still', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'Highly', 'educated', 'women', 'world', 'still', 'dominated', 'men', 'have', 'made', 'many', 'sacrifices', 'get', 'top', 'Admittedly', 'impossible', 'relate', 'circumstance', 'metaphor', 'times', 'even', 'today', 'root', 'character', 'even', 'more', 'Peggy', 'stopped', 'rooting', 'Don', 'while', 'ago', 'sense', 'found', 'Dr.', 'Miller', 'fate', 'only', 'semi-tragic', 'various', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'write', 'avoid', 'revealing', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers.I', 'hope', 'writers', 'Mad', 'Men', 'find', 'way', 'feature', 'Dr.', 'Faye', 'Miller', 'Season', '5', 'character', 'what', 'made', 'favorite', 'Mad', 'Men', 'season', 'so', 'far']",N/A

The micro-level sees great individual episodes, including an office Christmas party, a long night at the office from Don & Peggy, a rekindling of romance between Joan (Christina Hendricks) & Roger (John Slattery) and a bombshell announcement that changes the entire landscape of the advertising culture.On the macro-level, the Don/Betty dynamic is utterly fascinating, primarily embodied via daughter Sally (Kiernan Shipka).  Whereas in earlier seasons Don was set up as the &#34;hopeless womanizer&#34; with Betty &#34;holding everything together&#34;, viewers now begin to understand that those characterizations are not as black-and-white as they seem.  Like I've said in other reviews about this series, the show is always at its peak when Don is the major focus.  He doesn't &#34;do it alone&#34;, but any means, but it is his journey that gets the most attention (and thus is what us as viewers want the most resolution too).Basically, this fourth season of &#34;Mad Men&#34; cemented the series as one of my favorite shows of all-time.  Can it get a bit soapy at times?  Yes...no way around it.  But the characters are so interesting and feel so &#34;alive&#34; that one almost can't help but be sucked into the drama.",5,Gets Back To Season One Levels Of Storytelling & Characters,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",2013,2374,"['incredible', 'strong', 'finish', 'Season', 'Three', 'expected', 'Season', 'Four', '34', 'Mad', 'Men', '34', 'get', 'back', 'storytelling', 'perfection', 'being', 'said', 'even', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'quickly', 'gobbled', 'up', 'episodes', 'watching', 'pace', 'not', 'experienced', 'first', 'campaign', 'highlights', 'season', 'include', 'spoilers', 'here', '-The', 'new', 'ad', 'company', 'so', 'hastily', 'conceived', 'end', 'previous', 'season', 'struggling', 'things', 'new', 'business', 'typically', 'overhead', 'payroll', 'keeping', 'clients', 'happy', 'etc', '.-Don', 'Draper', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'lynchpin', 'show', 'character', 'drama', 'more', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'perhaps', 'other', 'season', 'drinking', 'problems', 'marital', 'issues', 'solutions', 'child-raising', 'quandaries.-Peggy', 'Olsen', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'really', 'finding', 'place', '34', 'man', 'world', '34', ""n't"", 'sheepish', 'wallflower', 'seasons', 'season.-The', 'former', 'Betty', 'Draper', 'January', 'Jones', 'trying', 'control', 'home', 'life', 'personal', 'life', 'going', 'other', 'direction.This', 'season', 'so', 'good', 'also', 'concurrently', 'two', 'different', 'levels', 'micro-level', 'sees', 'great', 'individual', 'episodes', 'including', 'office', 'Christmas', 'party', 'long', 'night', 'office', 'Don', 'Peggy', 'rekindling', 'romance', 'Joan', 'Christina', 'Hendricks', 'Roger', 'John', 'Slattery', 'bombshell', 'announcement', 'entire', 'landscape', 'advertising', 'macro-level', 'Don/Betty', 'dynamic', 'utterly', 'fascinating', 'primarily', 'embodied', 'daughter', 'Sally', 'Kiernan', 'Shipka', 'Whereas', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Don', 'was', 'set', 'up', '34', 'hopeless', 'womanizer', '34', 'Betty', '34', 'holding', 'everything', 'together', '34', 'viewers', 'now', 'begin', 'understand', 'characterizations', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'black-and-white', 'seem', ""'ve"", 'said', 'other', 'reviews', 'series', 'show', 'always', 'peak', 'when', 'Don', 'major', 'focus', ""n't"", '34', 'do', 'alone', '34', 'means', 'journey', 'most', 'attention', 'thus', 'what', 'viewers', 'want', 'most', 'resolution', 'too', '.Basically', 'fourth', 'season', '34', 'Mad', 'Men', '34', 'cemented', 'series', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'all-time', 'Can', 'get', 'bit', 'soapy', 'times', 'Yes', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'interesting', 'feel', 'so', '34', 'alive', '34', 'one', 'almost', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'sucked', 'drama']",N/A
