But I just couldn't get into it and never went past the 1st episode. It just wasn't funny or clever and mostly just boring for me.,1,not amsuing..,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,246,"['Never', 'having', 'seeing', '321', 'penguins', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'disc', 'lots', 'episodes', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'never', 'went', '1st', 'episode', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'clever', 'mostly', 'just', 'boring']",3 2 1 PENGUINS: COMPLETE SEASON ONE

They had not really seen this series until now and when they watched it they were just glued to the television. They laughed so much, but also, as I was watching too, I have to say that I really liked many of the messages that the show shares with people that watch. This was a great DVD set and if you like humor, and some great penguin antics, then this DVD set is for you!",5,A Great DVD!,1347235200,"09 10, 2012",2012,480,"['kids', 'have', 'loved', 'Madagascar', 'Penguins', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'first', 'Madagascar', 'movie', 'had', 'not', 'really', 'seen', 'series', 'now', 'when', 'watched', 'were', 'just', 'glued', 'television', 'laughed', 'so', 'much', 'also', 'was', 'watching', 'too', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'liked', 'many', 'messages', 'show', 'shares', 'people', 'watch', 'was', 'great', 'DVD', 'set', 'like', 'humor', 'great', 'penguin', 'antics', 'then', 'DVD', 'set']",3 2 1 PENGUINS: COMPLETE SEASON ONE

It looks like the first 45 minute episodes were cut down for TV then used those for this DVD rather than using the original full length versions. It takes a lot of the fun away from the original episodes.So even though this was cheap, and the kids really like watching it, I'd rather see them re-release the DVD with the full episodes and with them in order. I'd probably buy it again just for those improvements.",3,Good price and the entire season!,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,634,"['others', 'said', 'ridiculous', 'randomized', 'episodes', 'rather', 'leaving', 'order', 'story', 'season', 'actually', 'progress.We', 'noticed', 'few', 'times', 'cut', 'out', 'parts', 'series', 'first', '45', 'minute', 'episodes', 'were', 'cut', 'down', 'TV', 'then', 'used', 'DVD', 'rather', 'using', 'original', 'full', 'length', 'versions', 'lot', 'fun', 'away', 'original', 'episodes.So', 'even', 'was', 'cheap', 'kids', 'really', 'watching', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 're-release', 'DVD', 'full', 'episodes', 'order', ""'d"", 'probably', 'buy', 'again', 'just', 'improvements']",3 2 1 PENGUINS: COMPLETE SEASON ONE

I saw these while volunteering at my church's bible camp and they were quite entertaining so a large spectrum of kids. I just purchased them now for my 3 month old so that she can watch them when she is a little bigger (though she seems to enjoy the music and movement on the TV even now!).,5,Great Set,1378252800,"09 4, 2013",2013,336,"['great', 'set', 'children', 'ages', 'saw', 'volunteering', 'church', 'bible', 'camp', 'were', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'so', 'large', 'spectrum', 'kids', 'just', 'purchased', 'now', '3', 'month', 'old', 'so', 'can', 'watch', 'when', 'little', 'bigger', 'enjoy', 'music', 'movement', 'TV', 'even', 'now']",3 2 1 PENGUINS: COMPLETE SEASON ONE
1552025,A3SD3E6FIS6CS9,B008FXLZF8,Marine Corps Nomad,"[3, 3]","I have to be honest and say that even though we're big VeggieTales fans around here, we had never watched 3 2 1 Penguins! before we received this dvd. We found ourselves laughing at the crazy, wacky antics of the penguins. Yes, some parts were a little cheesy, but that's part of the draw of some of these characters. Each story focused on one key lesson that was learned by Michelle and/or Jason. Obviously, the penguins and the other characters in the story were learning the lesson right along with Michelle and Jason because the entire episode was designed to incorporate those Biblical lessons into them. Since Michelle and Jason are at their Grama's house, she also plays a role in getting the kids to learn their lessons. She shares the Bible verses with the kids to help them understand how it all fits together.If you're looking for a zany cartoon that your kids will enjoy and receive a good message, this series could be for you. It's nice to see a fun cartoon that teaches kids solid Biblical lessons.Disclosure: I received a copy of the above mentioned product to help facilitate the writing of a frank and honest review.
