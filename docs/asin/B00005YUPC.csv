I figured it might be worth checking out. I was not disappointed. Kevin Kline shines are a parent/exhusband who is trying to make good before he dies, only no one knows he's dying. They just think he's finally made good on his plans to build his dream house. Hayden Christensen (yes, the same one of STAR WARS fame) is great as a troubled teen. Kristen Scott Thomas has a small but critical role as the ex wife. This is a drama with a lot of heart. It has an engaging story line that men and women alike find appealing.

Many people say the movie is a sappy tearjerker. That it tries too hard to grab our emotions. This all very well may be true, but, after I saw this film, I thought it was wonderful. And, I even thought it was one of the better movies made in 2001. But, I sort of forgot about this movie since I saw it. Untill last night when I just happened to see it on tv.""Life As A House"" really is a great movie. Yes, I too can see the film's ""flaws"". But, the thing that gets me about this movie is how well done it is. The performances, escpecially by Kevin Klein (Who after I first saw this, I thought deserved an Oscar nomination) as a dying father. No one in this film seems to be ""playing it up"". No one is acting like a ham. I love the delicate touch the actors give the movie. ""Life As A House"" has so much heart to it, that I just can't find myself resisting the movie. But, besides acting and heart, the movie has other strong points. There are some very nice visual shot by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond. And at moments the movie has good dialogue.The story-line to the film may sound a bit confusing, but, I'll try to explain it as best as possible. George Monroe (Kevin Klein) plays an architect, who has hated the last 11 years of his life. He has a breakdown in his office and is fired as a result. He is then told he has cancer. One of his life long dreams was to build a ""perfect"" house. He nows sees this as the perfect time for him and his son, Sam (Hayden Christensen, in a role that drew much critical attention his way) to spend some time together and get to know one another. See, George was once married to Robin (Kirstin Scott Thomas) and they had Sam, but since the divorce, Robin has married Peter (Jamey Sheridan). And either one of them gets along with Sam, who locks himself in his room, does drugs, has piercings, and listens to loud music.""Life As A House"" does throw in some things that aren't really necessary. Like a sub-plot concerning one of George's neighbor's as his ex-girlfriend, played by Mary Steenburgen. And now her daughter, Alyssa (Jene Malone) likes Sam. This doesn't really do anything for the story itself. And I guess certain things were thrown in for a comic relief, like the fact that almost everyone in the neighborhood, thinks George is crazy. But, over-all the effect of the movie works.Some may see this movie as a rip off of ""American Beauty"", I can see how and why someone might think that, but I don't completely agree. I think this film is trying to do it's own thing. Plus, I think ""Beauty"" is a better film anyway lol. Certain things in this movie may seem obvious and you will be able to tell what will happen, but, it's what takes place inbetween those moments that makes ""Life As A House"" work.A lot of people dislike this movie because they said it's trying to be too many things at once. It has the human element needed to be a drama, it has funny moments, and has romance. Well, to these people I just say, at that what life itself is filled with? ""Life As A House"" wants to be one of those kinds of movies that ""gets life on screen"". It wants to be comprised of the things that we all go through. Granted, we all may not exactly led the same lives these characters lead, but, I think everyone gets the point I'm trying to make. So despite it's flaws, ""Life As A House"" is a movie I hope everyone who sees it enjoys.Bottom-line: An effective well done ""tearjerker"" that has wonderful performance, fine directing, and some beautiful dialogue.

Kevin Kline broke my heart, Jena Malone stole my attention and Hayden Christensen just blew me away.  Besides, Kristen Scott-Thomas can do no wrong; seriously.  That said, this is one of those films that hasn't aged very well and upon recent viewings and reflection, the film has so many lows that counterbalance its true highs.  The emotional impact is somewhat manipulative, and not in that subtle way that is acceptable, forgivable and wholly encouraged.  The actually character development lacks some depth, instead shooting for obvious and superficial construction.  The metaphorical aspect of the film (the reconstruction of the house representing the reconstruction of his fractured family) had promise, and at times achieves what it sets after, but overall it feels roughly established and more of a gimmick than anything else.  Still, the acting across the board is stellar, especially Christensen who was a true flash in the pan (I worshiped him on `Higher Ground' and thought that he should have been nominated for the Oscar for this role; and still do).  Kline has a wonderful way of internalizing his emotions, which helps add layers of subtlety needed to glue us to his character.  Scott-Thomas is amazing and even Malone gives a nicely realized performance.  Still, the script is messy and the overall effect isn't quite what I remembered it being.  I like this movie, but the love has faded for me.  I can understand why so many adore it (it is constructed in a way that elicits a tearful reaction) but something about this film feels less than honest, and that isn't something I appreciate now that I'm older.",3,Great acting semi-saves a sloppy script...,1312502400,"08 5, 2011",2011,1762,"['hard', 'admit', 'film', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'saw', 'fell', 'love', 'lauded', 'entirely', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'broke', 'heart', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'stole', 'attention', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'just', 'blew', 'away', 'Besides', 'Kristen', 'Scott-Thomas', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'seriously', 'said', 'one', 'films', ""n't"", 'aged', 'very', 'well', 'recent', 'viewings', 'reflection', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'lows', 'counterbalance', 'true', 'highs', 'emotional', 'impact', 'somewhat', 'manipulative', 'not', 'subtle', 'way', 'acceptable', 'forgivable', 'wholly', 'encouraged', 'actually', 'character', 'development', 'depth', 'instead', 'shooting', 'obvious', 'superficial', 'construction', 'metaphorical', 'aspect', 'film', 'reconstruction', 'house', 'representing', 'reconstruction', 'fractured', 'family', 'had', 'promise', 'times', 'achieves', 'what', 'overall', 'roughly', 'established', 'more', 'gimmick', 'anything', 'else', 'Still', 'acting', 'board', 'stellar', 'especially', 'Christensen', 'who', 'was', 'true', 'flash', 'pan', 'worshiped', 'Higher', 'Ground', 'thought', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'role', 'still', 'do', 'Kline', 'wonderful', 'way', 'internalizing', 'emotions', 'add', 'layers', 'subtlety', 'needed', 'glue', 'character', 'Scott-Thomas', 'amazing', 'even', 'Malone', 'nicely', 'realized', 'performance', 'Still', 'script', 'messy', 'overall', 'effect', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'remembered', 'being', 'movie', 'love', 'faded', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'constructed', 'way', 'tearful', 'reaction', 'something', 'film', 'less', 'honest', ""n't"", 'something', 'appreciate', 'now', ""'m"", 'older']",N/A

690935,A3TOWO3PUY3DGL,B00005YUPC,-Ashi-,"[0, 0]","It's an okay film overall, especially if you watched it through.  Initially, the movie gave me a lot of wince.  It's not because Kevin Kline's character was going postal, nor Hayden Christensen played an emo doing what appeared to be auto-erotic asphyxia, or Jena Malone's character was totally a wh*re.  No, none of that, but it's because the script was flawed in term of characterization.I can understand why George (Kevin Kline) gone postal, and why he actually endured 20-some years before he blew up.  Did he not think through the consequence of his action?  He doesn't strike me as a person who would bottle up his anger for decades.  No, in fact, we had seen him pee into the ocean.  This is not a reserve, introverted person.  He doesn't care a squat about what people think of him.I don't like why Sam decided to suddenly shed his make-up (yes, Hayden was fabulous with eyeliners, eye shadow, lip stick).  I think the filmmakers want us to see the progress of his character from a rebel to a daddy's boy....  Nevertheless, that was on a questionable premise.  Does putting make up on makes him an awful person?  Granted, maybe he did all that for the shock effect, because he wanted to be a rebel, but I never believe he was ever a ""bad boy"" at all, or at least the script does not set me up to become a believer of that.There are a lot of stuff in this film that made me want to ask how can everyone tolerate George's self-pity for so long?  It's nice he built a house before he died, to fulfill his dream.  That's all fine, but I do not like the motivation behind it.  This is ""Life as a House"", not ""Me as a Planet"".In term of direction, the director mentioned he wanted to make a film that examine what's going on in our society today.  If that's the direction, I have to say he was looking at our society in a rather conservative scope (and I am a conservative).  The kind a parent would condemn their kid with.  I do not believe the movie made a good point on ""what can be done"", instead, it judged, ""this is dysfunctional.""I do like the house though.  It looks comfy and spacious.  :-)  The people behind the scene put a lot of effort into it, and I do like the analogy.  Life /is/ like a house.  The house analogy reminds me of ""House of Sand and Fog.""  (which is a very good movie)Overall it's a good film, but it's flawed.

A fundamentally simple story of disaffected people, father and son, who come together to build a house. The script works hard to stay away from hokey sentimentality and succeeds; it's less successful when it tries too hard to be amusing, particularly with the snotty neighbor who's at war with Klein's dog and the silly sidebar of Mary Steenburgen's affair with a young male friend of her daughter's. Hayden Christensen is absolutely wonderful as the pill-taking, pot-smoking, angry and alienated son. Not only is he a beautiful young man, he's also a powerful actor who's completely convincing as Klein's son. Jena Malone has grown up to be a good actress, one who looks real--as if she might actually be the daughter of Klein's next-door neighbor. The usually icy Kristin Scott Thomas is warm and unpredictable as Kevin's former wife.The film moves into Capra feel-good territory with everyone and his brother coming along to help finish building the house--which is such a wonderful-looking place that people would be lining up to live in it. The early scenes between Klein and Christensen are just terrific and it's a shame that this level of truthful intensity isn't sustained throughout the film.

At times his pain, his physical pain, is not convincing. That doesn't matter. Because he talks about his own father, he talks about all of the horrendous mistakes his own father made, and he can still say that he ""loved him too much."" I believe him, I understand, and in that moment I, too, care.Christensen's character, a young man trying to find himself, his place, when he has no idea where to look, is remarkable. His transformation seems to take hold and progress rapidly. It's unrealistic. And it doesn't matter. Because, where once he couldn't tolerate the touch of another, he holds his father's hand. His arms come around his mother first and he holds her as though he is a child again.

His relationship with his rebellious, strained teenage son, Sam (Hayden Christensen) is, if anything, invisible. Sam lives with George's ex-wife, Robin Kimball (Kristin Scott Thomas), who married another man. When George insists that Sam spend the summer with him in his shack-of-a-home, which is actually a garage, Sam thinks his life is over. George decides to rebuild his runt-down house in the time that he has left to live. As he builds the house with his family, George starts to learn more about his family as Sam starts to learn about life. Also helping out is a neighbor, Alyssa Beck (Jena Malone), who grows close to Sam.MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: I thought ""Life As A House"" was a wonderful film. The acting performances were truly superb and could only make the film better and more enjoyable. Stand-out performances include Kline and Christensen--two extremely talented actors with great father/son on-screen chemistry. There wasn't much in the way of special effects, because it's a more drama, but the screenplay was well-written and the characters were well developed. The storyline was excellent, too. This film is filled with emotions--from the confused, rebellion of Sam, to the sadness that George will eventually die. What's interesting about this film is to see how George reconnects with his family after being away from them for so long.The DVD extras are a plus to ""Life As A House"". The bonus material include deleted scenes, two original documentaries, theatrical press kit (which include cast and crew biographies), DVD-ROM extras, theatrical trailer, and more.

One can hope he is allowed to do the same with his role in the upcoming Star Wars: Attack of the Clones.Watching Kline deal with his illness is, obviously, the main point of the film.  How he deals with it, from a touching scene with a nurse early in the film, to his method for reaching into the abyss that has swallowed his character's son allows Kline to really showcase his superb acting talent.  It is unfortunate that the Academy did not acknowledge his performance when making the nominations this year - he certainly was up to Oscar standards.A fine ensemble cast rounds out the film, with such notables as Mary Steenburgen and Scott Bakula adding nice touches throughout.  Some interesting side stories keep the movie from bogging down, as some dramas often do.

I'm only 21 and I have had that day.  George (Kevin Kline) has had one too.  He's a forty-ish architech who's fallen out of touch with his estranged ex-wife and his children, most notably his teenage son.  Whats worse yet is that, upon realizing his failure as a parent, he finds out that he hasn't much time to make it better.  He's been diagnosed with cancer and his time is short.  George decides to get to know his son by building his dream home with him.  George's son (played BRILLIANTLY by newcomer Hayden Christensen, and if you'd seen Chistensen on the TV show Higher Ground then you already knew he could pull this off) is far from thrilled about the quality time he'll be spending with his father and is determined to get out of it, or at least make his father miserable during the process.  What's heartwrenching is that George hasn't told anyone about his condition, but once it's revield you can only imagine the heartache in store for the central charactors, including his ex-wife played by Kristin Scott Thomas.  Kevin Kline gives the performance of his career here, as does Christensen who plays the gothic loner prostitute with so much conviction you feel for him every second of this film.  As the movie winds down to its tear jerker of an ending you'll be left wondering if you've done all you could to be the best father/son/mother/wife/husband you could so that when you pass you'll be remembered favorably.

Sam's mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) is at her wits end with her drug using, angst ridden son and agrees to let him stay the summer with his father. While tearing down his old, shack of house (that clearly annoys the neighbors) Kline's character,George, tries to reach out to his son and work through years of neglect that he regrets.  Clearly, as he tears down the walls of his old house, he begins to tear down the walls of hurt that his son feels. The rest of the story revolves around the building of the house, involving neighbors---Mary Steenburgen and Jenna Malone, as a mother and daughter who live next door and Scott Bakula, as a good hearted police man.  Kline gives a very good performance as does Scott Thomas.  The chemistry between the two is very good.

690964,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005YUPC,D. Litton,"[9, 12]","""Life as a House"" is pretty much everything you would expect from yet another addition to the tearjerker genre. There is a canvas filled with characters who deal with life changing situations and events that shape who they will become once the movie reaches a predictable, thoroughly unoriginal conclusion. We know from the start how it begins, how it ends, what happens, and who it happens to. And I must say, I've never seen the formula done quite so well.The story introduces us into the dysfunctional life of George (Kevin Kline), a simple man with a not-so-simple issues plaguing him. His ex-wife of ten years, Robin (Kristin Scott Thomas), pleads with him to take their estranged son, Sam (Hayden Christensen), for the summer in hopes that the two will reconcile their differences, and that Sam will rid himself of the hatred for his family. His neighbors abhor his ramshackle house and unorthodox living conditions (the absence of indoor plumbing requires him to urinate outdoors). He has just lost his job of twenty years, and to top it all off, he now has a terminal illness.From here, the movie fills its already intriguing canvas with various, continually involving subplots. Against his will, Sam goes to spend his summer vacation with his father, who has plans for building a new house where his shack stands, hoping that the experience will bring them closer together. Of course, the two bicker constantly, Sam shutting himself off, George making light of every situation.Along the way, more characters come into play, and previously introduced characters make larger impressions. Sam makes a strange friend in Alyssa (Jena Malone), who sees fit to shower with him, but only wants to remain friends. Robin takes an interest in helping George in the construction of the house; we soon get the feeling that they harvest old feelings for one another, which throws a wrench into her present marriage.All of this takes some pretty familiar twists and turns, adhering to the age-old formulas of father-and-son reconciliation, people finding rejuvenation through life changes, the healing of broken relationships and the creation of new obstacles that are easily overcome. The fact that we know George is dying is a plus, as it prevents the movie from using it as a startling revelation later in the film. It also gives the audience a choice: either succumb to the movie's predictability and familiarity, or flee.Imagine my surprise when I found myself immensely enjoying the film. Throughout much of Irwin Winkler's respectable melodramatic web of intertwining stories, there are unique touches of jovial humor and real emotion played out by his brilliant cast, who elevate the movie to above-average standards. Kline's biting humor and zest for life are a life force for the film, while Christensen is extremely convincing as the rebellious Sam. These two gifted actors not only sell us on their characters, but make the routine reconciliation believable. Scott Thomas, Malone, and various other supporting actors bring out the best in each character, so that they quickly become people we can identify with and care for.Your embracement of a film like ""Life as a House"" requires that you have a soft spot for the genre, and all its various devices. Having said that, this is a rare gem of a movie that made me laugh, almost made me cry, and gave me nothing more than an enjoyable two hours spent getting to know some very complex and inviting characters.

He portrays the beyond messed up Sam who is angry, confused and hateful of the world beautifully. This movie is centered around the last summer of a man who wants to spend that time rebuilding his ramshackle house.  Knowing he is sick, he enlists his goth son to stay with him and help for the summer, but Sam doesn't want to.  Instead he wants to spend the summer taking drugs and partying.There is a lot of tension between father and son, but there are some humorous times too.  This one is very sad, but at the same time, its not so much about dying, but living life to the fullest with what little time you have.

I can't say that it hit a strong chord with me on the personal scale in my ability to relate to the characters or the action, but it did draw me in.U.S. produced films of this nature are quite rare.  Why?  This is a character study.  Most U.S. films are attempts to score hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue by blowing things up and showing as much cleavage as possible, all the while cursing up a storm.  There is typically very little dialogue.  This is not the case with Life as a House.Okay, so there's more than necessary cursing coming from the rebellious son - but somehow it doesn't seem to intrude too much on this film, because it struck me as typical of the kids that age.  And then there's the sex...It, too, is present, but it is a device not the plot.The screenwriter(s) obviously knew what the heart and soul of this film should be and did their best to keep it as such.  The actors, in turn, cranked out some great performances.  They felt real.  It was actually nice to see realistically portrayed characters instead of the Hollywood version of the same.  This is definitely a California-centric film, but at least it doesn't assume that everyone watching it lives their lives in the same manner as the characters in the film.  It doesn't talk down to us.  It doesn't preach to us.

The storyline was very believable: love can overcome anything.There were grotesque parts of this movie, parts that some would prefer not to think about. However, they must be viewed in order to understand the complexity which makes this world up; none of the depressing, dark scenes were fiction.My emotions changed remarkably during the time I spent watching this movie, and since I first rented it I went and purchased it, simply because I think it holds such potential to change the way people view the world, their lives, and those around them.

I almost let myself get scared off by other reviewers' mentions of drug abuse, autoerotic hanging scene, pimping out of young boys to homosexuals, etc. Yes, all of the above is in Life. But - it is all necessary to the movie. You are not supposed to love (or even LIKE) the characters as they are introduced in this movie. George, the cancer-striken father, is self-absorbed and insensitive. Sam, his drug-abusing son, is so filled with hate that it causes him to act out in ways that were really difficult for me to watch. The beauty of Life as a House is that you begin to care about the characters because they change and grow. I can't think of anyone in Hollywood better to play such difficult roles than Kevin Kline and Hayden Christensen. It was so hard for me to feel sympathetic to Sam's character because of the choices he made, but Hayden Christensen's performance really brought me around by the end of the film. Instead of coasting by on his good looks like most young actors (Orlando Bloom, anyone?)Christensen always brings such a strength of character to his roles and I really respect him for that. All of the actors in this film really bring so much sincerity and honesty to their roles. I also recommend watching the featurette ""Building Character: Inside Life as a House"". It really gives you a feel for the movie as the director envisioned it. You also see a side of Kevin Kline, Kristen Scott Thomas, and Hayden Christensen that added so much to my enjoyment of the movie. This could have been such a cliche of a movie with the oft-seen themes of death, life, and reconciliation. But it was handled with such a deft touch by the director, writer, and the actors that it really comes off well. I enjoyed Life as a House very much, will almost certainly watch it again, and thank the other Amazon.com reviewers for both warning me and intriguing me about this great movie.",5,Despite mixed reviews on Amazon...,1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,1950,"['finally', 'decided', 'watch', 'Life', 'House', 'loved', 'almost', 'let', 'get', 'scared', 'off', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mentions', 'drug', 'abuse', 'autoerotic', 'hanging', 'scene', 'pimping', 'young', 'boys', 'homosexuals', 'etc', 'Yes', 'above', 'Life', 'necessary', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'love', 'even', 'LIKE', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'movie', 'George', 'cancer-striken', 'father', 'self-absorbed', 'insensitive', 'Sam', 'drug-abusing', 'son', 'so', 'filled', 'hate', 'act', 'out', 'ways', 'were', 'really', 'difficult', 'watch', 'beauty', 'Life', 'House', 'begin', 'care', 'characters', 'change', 'grow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'Hollywood', 'better', 'play', 'such', 'difficult', 'roles', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'was', 'so', 'hard', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'Sam', 'character', 'choices', 'made', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'performance', 'really', 'brought', 'end', 'film', 'Instead', 'coasting', 'good', 'looks', 'most', 'young', 'actors', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'anyone', 'Christensen', 'always', 'such', 'strength', 'character', 'roles', 'really', 'respect', 'actors', 'film', 'really', 'bring', 'so', 'much', 'sincerity', 'honesty', 'roles', 'also', 'recommend', 'watching', 'featurette', 'Building', 'Character', 'Inside', 'Life', 'House', 'really', 'feel', 'movie', 'director', 'envisioned', 'also', 'see', 'side', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Kristen', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'added', 'so', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cliche', 'movie', 'oft-seen', 'themes', 'death', 'life', 'reconciliation', 'was', 'handled', 'deft', 'touch', 'director', 'writer', 'actors', 'really', 'off', 'well', 'enjoyed', 'Life', 'House', 'very', 'much', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'watch', 'again', 'thank', 'other', 'Amazon.com', 'reviewers', 'warning', 'intriguing', 'great', 'movie']",N/A

It's about trying to leave a mark on this world before you leave it.  But ultimately, it's about humanity and the ties between family members that are the strongest when they are being tested.George Monroe, (Kevin Kline), is a talented architect whose life is falling apart.  He just got fired from his job for lack of productivity.  He is divorced from his ex-wife, Robin (Kristin Scott Thomas), with whom their son Sam, (Hayden Christenson) lives.Sam is a rebellious teenager and Robin and her new husband can no longer stand for his behavior.  Sam is on drugs, dyes his hair blue and listens to Marilyn Manson, (which is probably the only problem with this film in that it nourishes the stereotype that those actions are typically that of a troubled teen).George decides that it's time he starts trying to fix the mess he has made of his life before it's too late.  So he offers to take Sam for the summer, which is not met without a fight, so that Sam can help George work on his house, which he intends to completely tear down and re-build.At first, this isn't as therapeutic as it should be for Sam, since he insists on rebelling and even getting involved with a pimp, (Ian Somerhalder), for more drugs.  It isn't until George's neighbor's, (Mary Steenburgen), daughter, (Jena Malone), aggressively starts a relationship with Sam that he makes some more mature decisions to ditch the drugs and to finally start appreciating the love of those who care for him.Despite obstacles at every turn, like spiteful neighbors and petitions to shut him down, George and his crew continue to build his house, which can easily be seen as a symbol for getting his life in order.  Soon, everyone is inspired to help and before he knows it, George has his own crew of friends and family helping him achieve his goal!  Unfortunately, none of them realize that George has an ulterior motive in that he is dying of cancer and wants to finish this goal before he dies, while trying to save his family in the process.The tale that is told is a common one but the way in which it is executed is tender and touching.  The soundtrack helps to frame the moods of the film, with songs from Joni Mitchell to Guster to Marilyn Manson, and the focus of the film is more on the positivity of what George is trying to accomplish.Unlike many other films that deal with cancer, there is very little spotlight on George's sickness itself.  It isn't overdone to make for depressing drama.  It is only brought up when there is a genuine need to mention it.  The film sets out to prove that anything can be done with a little tenacity, a lot of support and a goal.

690992,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005YUPC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","Kevin Kline might be one of the most under appreciated actors in Hollywood today.  &quot;Life as a House&quot; is a fairly predictable film.  Kline's character George Malone has been been fired from his job, making models for an architectural firm, and been diagnosed with terminal cancer.  He has one summer left and he intends to use it tearing down the shack in which he lives and building a house.  He also demands that his son, Sam (Hayden Christensen), live with him in the garage while this is going on, instead of with his ex-wife, Robin (Kirsten Scott Thomas).  Sam is an angry young man, with blue hair, various body piercings a fondness for drugs, and a profound sense of self-loathing.  Will father and son reconcile before it is too late?  Will George and Robin rekindle their feelings for each other?  Will the house be built?  Do you really have to ask any of these questions?  You already know the answers.But it is largely because of Kline's performance that you end up not minding about the film's predictability and the way things tend to neatly fall together.  Actually, the performances in this film are pretty good across the board.  The developing relationship between George and Robin is especially effective; I have never been especailly enamored of Thomas as an actress, but she and Kline have undeniable chemistry.  Even director Irvin Winkler was impressed by how much the pair added to the words on the page through their performances (he claims he never thought there was anything going on between the two characters until he saw the performances on screen).Of course, George is not the only character in his family with problems.  Robin finds herself in a loveless marriage with cold fish Peter (Jamey Sheridan) and their rebellious son hates himself and everybody else.  George also has problems beyond the fact that he is dying as he, his dog, and his house are the subject of various complaints by his assorted neighbors.  George used to date his next-door neighbor Coleen (Mary Steenburgen), and now her daughter Alyssa (Jena Malone) has taken an interest in Sam.  Meanwhile, her boyfriend Josh (Ian Somerahlder), has a strange way of showing he is Sam's friend.  There are several surprises regarding these other characters, including a very realistic shower scene, but they are secondary to the main plot lines dealing with George's house, son, and ex-wife.I do not want to dismiss this film as a mere tear-jerker, because &quot;Life as a House&quot; is more than that and the best scenes in the film are not those that make you reach for your tissues.

They are both redemption stories, that is true, but there is a galaxy of difference between the two movies. In this regard, ""Life as a House"" it is neither soup nor wet bread, as we say in Italy; therefore, it fails to accomplish its very purpose. Let me explain; I got the movie because the back cover said it was a story about redemption and renovation. Now, if viewers want to watch this kind of movie, it is because they like redemption stories, right? If they like redemption stories, it means that they care (at least a bit) about morality, right? Otherwise, why care about redemption, redemption from what? Do you see my point? Good. Then, why in the world would you present a (completely unnecessary) subplot with the mother of the female protagonist engaging in a ... relationship with a teenage friend ... of her daughter's? What is even worse, why would you not present it in a negative way, but, on the contrary, with a lighthearted approach as if you were showing a funny scene from ""Friends?"" Don't you realize that this fact alone was fatal and totally bombed the entire movie? At least, in ""The Devil's Advocate,"" Charlize Theron was able to see that all the ""nice"" people she was surrounded by, behind all their nice appearance and all, were demons of the worst species.

But even his relationships with his neighbors often leave something to be desired. When he is fired from his architect job, he takes his severance package and uses it to build a new house on the site of the old one, enlisting his unwilling son and his wife's support to build his dream house. Eventually even his neighbors, with whom, as I mentioned, George also hasn't always had the best relations either, get into the spirit of the project, as George attempts to build his dream house before time runs out.As another reviewer noted, the movie is rich in metaphor and works at many different levels of meaning. Perhaps the most interesting one is the analogy between the building of the new house and the rebuilding of the relationships with his son and former wife. As the walls of the old house are torn down, so George tears down the emotional barriers that have isolated him from his son and his wife. And the building of the new house becomes a metaphor for the new relationships he is creating with them.There is not a false note or misstep in the entire cast. The whole cast is really superb in the movie, and Kline gives an Oscar-worthy performance in the role of George Monroe. George knows he has nothing to lose since time is running out, and so he goes for broke--he is brutally honest with his son--even about the abuse he continually suffered at the hands of his own father, and about his own love-hate relationship with him.At one point George finds his troubled son standing at the cliff-side overlooking the ocean, which is hundreds of feet below. George walks up and says ""Thinking of jumping?"" His son says, ""No, thinking of pushing"" (referring to George). At that point George takes a death-defying leap off the cliff into the pounding waves at the base of the cliff, as his stunned son looks on. But George survives and although his son is now convinced his father is a complete wacko (as he says), he's also convinced he should give George a chance to rebuild their failed relationship.But the other relationships in the movie are also equally well done, especially between George and his wife, between his teenage son and the girl next door.All in all a great movie.

It didn't even need to be beautiful. It just needed to be mine"". That phrase, said by George, the main character of this movie, is in my opinion a good introduction to a review about ""Life a house"".George (Kevin Kline) is a divorced architect who is sacked from a job he hated. Immediately after that, he collapses and is taken to a hospital, where he gets bad news: he is going to die in a few months. George has to come to terms with the fact that he has terminal cancer, and only some months left to live. Wanting to make the best of it, George decides to build the house he always wanted to have, and get to know better his 16 year-old son son Sam (Hayden Christensen), who lives with his ex-wife, Robin (Kristin Scott-Thomas).Robin is now married to a successful man, and has new sons, but doesn't relate well to her older son, who is highly problematic, uses drugs, and has a very negative attitude towards everything. That is probably the reason why she allows Sam to live with George during his summer holidays. Things won't be easy between George and Sam, though, because Sam resents George for leaving him with his mother. Father and son don't have a strong relationship now, or rather they don't have any kind of relationship besides the biological one. That is something that George will try to change, as he and Sam tear down a shack that was willed to him by his father, and begin to build a new one.Soon enough, building the house begins to be an affair of many more than two, as Robin, her kids, and some new friends that Sam makes start to help. As the house begins to take shape, the spectator almost sees old wounds closing, even as fights abound. But what will happen when Sam finds out about his father's illness?. See this movie, and find out... I think this film is worth your time, and that you don't regret watching it  :)It is important to point out, however, that ""Life as a house"" is not adequate for children, as it contains some sexual scenes and strong language. Morever, it touches upon subjects as prostitution and drug abuse. Despite that, those characteristics fit the story, and aren't in the film just for the sake of it.All in all, I believe that Irwin Winkler should be congratulated on having directed such a good movie.

He moves his drug-addicted, mad-at-the-world son into his ramshackle home for the summer.  He throws himself into building the house of his dreams and straightening out his son's life by giving him what his own father never could - love.George Monroe is wonderfully portrayed by Kevin Kline.

And once again in &quot;Life as a House&quot;  he is saved... this time by an extraordinary cast: Kevin Kline (George), Kristin Scott Thomas (Robin), Hayden Christensen (Sam), Jena Malone (Alyssa) and Mary Steenburgen (Coleen). Winkler is much more successful as a producer, the original and best &quot;Rocky&quot; being one of his producing credits.Kline and Scott-Tomas are pros and almost everything they do in this movie is perfect...all Winkler had to do was make sure they hit their marks and that the camera was in focus.  But Christensen is a newcomer, and even though he does an excellent job overall, some of his scenes are overwrought and simply don't ring true...where it is obvious he is play-acting.  Ditto for Malone, who is always excellent and is particularly radiant in this film, a firm director would have pulled her back from seeming overly coy and fake in a couple of her scenes.The basic story is simple: A dying man (Kline) decides to clean up his life by tearing down his eye-sore house and building a new one and in the process hopes to repair his relationship with his son (Christensen)whom he has neglected and &quot;written off.&quot;There is real magic in all the scenes between Kline and Scott-Thomas.

Mazza,"[9, 12]","&quot;Life as a House,&quot; directed by Irwin Winkler, stars Kevin Kline as George, a divorced architect who lives in a decaying eyesore of his own by the shore. His ex-wife, Robin (Kristin Scott Thomas) and their substance-abusing son Sam (Hayden Christensen) live nearby with Robin's current husband and two more children. After losing his job, George sets out to tear down his current home and, together with his estranged son, build a house of which he can be truly proud.I have seen and heard &quot;House&quot; compared to the film &quot;American Beauty.&quot; Certainly the two films share many elements: a middle aged man separated from his job and undergoing a personal crisis; a nymphettish teen female character; familial discord; and Scott Bakula in a likeable supporting role. But &quot;House&quot; has a more conventional, soap opera-ish quality, and lacks the surreal inventiveness of &quot;Beauty.&quot; Still, &quot;House&quot; is on the whole a moving and entertaining drama.The best thing about &quot;House&quot; is the fine work done by a great ensemble cast. Kline brings a visceral sense of pain and a transcendent grace to his role. Christensen is a revelation: he is truly frightening in his nihilistic &quot;teen from hell&quot; mode, and brings great depth to Sam's character arc. Mary Steenburgen brings a sympathetic lustiness to her performance as George's neighbor, and Jena Malone impressed me as her daughter.The script offers some thoughtful reflections on life, love, pain, and reconciliation. The house building theme is well integrated into the family drama. The film is not without flaws. In particular, there is one unnecessary plot twist which may strike some viewers as homophobic. But all things considered, I recommend &quot;Life As a House&quot; for those seeking a good adult drama with an outstanding ensemble cast.",4,Terrific ensemble shines in this &quot;House&quot;,1008547200,"12 17, 2001",2001,1860,"['quot', 'Life', 'House', 'quot', 'directed', 'Irwin', 'Winkler', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'George', 'divorced', 'architect', 'who', 'decaying', 'eyesore', 'own', 'shore', 'ex-wife', 'Robin', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'substance-abusing', 'son', 'Sam', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'live', 'nearby', 'Robin', 'current', 'husband', 'two', 'more', 'children', 'losing', 'job', 'George', 'out', 'tear', 'down', 'current', 'home', 'together', 'estranged', 'son', 'build', 'house', 'can', 'be', 'truly', 'proud.I', 'have', 'seen', 'heard', 'quot', 'House', 'quot', 'compared', 'film', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty.', 'quot', 'Certainly', 'two', 'films', 'share', 'many', 'elements', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'separated', 'job', 'undergoing', 'personal', 'crisis', 'nymphettish', 'teen', 'female', 'character', 'familial', 'discord', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'likeable', 'supporting', 'role', 'quot', 'House', 'quot', 'more', 'conventional', 'soap', 'opera-ish', 'quality', 'surreal', 'inventiveness', 'quot', 'Beauty.', 'quot', 'Still', 'quot', 'House', 'quot', 'whole', 'moving', 'entertaining', 'drama.The', 'best', 'thing', 'quot', 'House', 'quot', 'fine', 'work', 'done', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Kline', 'visceral', 'sense', 'pain', 'transcendent', 'grace', 'role', 'Christensen', 'revelation', 'truly', 'frightening', 'nihilistic', 'quot', 'hell', 'quot', 'great', 'depth', 'Sam', 'character', 'arc', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'sympathetic', 'lustiness', 'performance', 'George', 'neighbor', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'impressed', 'daughter.The', 'script', 'thoughtful', 'reflections', 'life', 'love', 'pain', 'reconciliation', 'house', 'building', 'theme', 'well', 'integrated', 'family', 'drama', 'film', 'not', 'flaws', 'particular', 'one', 'unnecessary', 'plot', 'twist', 'may', 'strike', 'viewers', 'homophobic', 'things', 'considered', 'recommend', 'quot', 'Life', 'House', 'quot', 'seeking', 'good', 'adult', 'drama', 'outstanding', 'ensemble', 'cast']",N/A

His ex-wife Robin ( Kristin Scott Thomas)remarried years ago, and took primary custody over their son Sam ( Hayden Christian). George has been told by his doctor that he is dying of cancer, and that he has three months left to live. This time period also happen to coincide with Sam's summer vacation. George wants to spend the last three months of his life, forming a relationship with his son, who he has barely spoken to in the last 13 years. George feels the best way for him to bond with Sam, is for them to build a house together, that Sam can live in after George has passed on.Life as a House is one of the best films that I have ever seen. The film features an emotional story of a father and son getting to know each other, and eventually coming to love each other. Director Irvin Winkler and writer Mark Andrus came up with the perfect way for this to happen. Watching George and Sam work together on the house is great. The film also features a wonderful romantic element as well, because George and Robin manage to fall back in love after being seperated for so long.  This film is definately a tear jerker as well. I never cry when I watch movies, and this film even had me bawling my eyes out. Kevin Kline should have been nominated for an oscar for his role in this film. I feel that it is the best of his career. He accurately portrayed a man who is gradualy dying and who is estranged from his son. Hayden Christian and Kristin Scott Thomas did a wonderful job as well. The film also features other great actors such as Jena Malone, Mary Steenburgen, and Scott Bakula.Overall, Life as a House is an amazing film.

691012,A2SETXU4UY67C9,B00005YUPC,"Ms Diva ""cycworker""","[3, 4]","The latest Kevin Kline vehicle, Life as a House is further proof that Kline is one of greatest and most under appreciated actor of our times. Kline plays George, who has cancer and lives alone in a dilapidated old shack that his late father left him. When he loses his job, he takes custody of his sixteen year old son, Sam. George wants to repair his relationship with his son before it is too late. Sam is an extremely troubled young man. He does drugs, he listens to Marilyn Manson, he has blue hair and numerous piercings, and most dangerously, he's taken to temporarily hanging himself from his closet bar to get a rush. His mother, Robin is unable to reach him. She's got her own problems dealing with her faltering marriage to Peter.Sounds like a soap opera, doesn't it? And a rather lame one, at that. But in the hands of these able actors, it isn't. Kline is especially effective as George. He is equally adept at playing both the movie's dramatic and comic moments. In the hands of a lesser actor, the revelation of George's abusive childhood would have seem trite and clich&eacute;d. Kline finds the truth in the moment. He shows that George gets that he can't erase his past, or suddenly have a picture perfect Hallmark card relationship with Sam. He just wants to somehow try to connect with his kid, and help him. He sees that Sam is as angry with him as he was at his own dad; that he is sinking under the weight of his own anger and pain, and he wants to somehow break the cycle. George doesn't reveal his illness to Robin and Sam until near the end of the movie. This fact could either make George appear like a martyr or a bastard. As Kline plays him, he is neither - he is simply a human being.Kline and Christensen (and to a lesser extent, Kristen  are the heart, soul and center of this movie, and the two deliver. They have a palpable chemistry and play a believable father and sonHayden Christensen is a revelation. I admit, he was a bit awkward and shouted too much in some of his angry scenes, but he made it work for the character. I empathized with Sam. I wanted to know more about him and where is anger came from. This type of character is often a clich&eacute; (and, admittedly, he was, to an extent), but Christensen managed to rise above it. He gave Sam an awkwardness, a sadness in his eyes, that made him seem vulnerable and real. I especially like that although Sam admits he loves his father, the ambivalence and anger never completely fades. Christensen and Kline bring a real depth to this relationship.  The rest of the cast was equally good although many of their roles were quite small - this movie was about Sam and George, and Robin, to a lesser extent. I was disappointed that Scott Thomas's role was so underwritten; she's a brilliant actress. She did a beautiful job in the scenes where George reveals his illness, and when he dies. She and Kline have a nice chemistry.I have to talk about the flaws in this movie. I have to admit, it is riddled with clich&eacute;s. I hated that Robin fell back in love with George - a deeper understanding and a friendship would've been better.  The characters needed more depth.  There were also too many subplots in the movie. In the end, everyone comes together to help George and Sam finish the house he's building, and I'm never quite sure why. In moments like that the movie seems to be trying to be like the movie American Beauty, and that doesn't work. Those are the moments that are especially soap opera-like. The movie needed to stay focused on the George and his relationships.In the end, I would still recommend this movie, although maybe only on video or on cheap night. The sheer quality of the acting, the gorgeous ocean cinematography, and the soundtrack make it worthwhile, despite the plodding pace and clich&eacute;s in the writing.",4,Good. but flawed,1011139200,"01 16, 2002",2002,3833,"['latest', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'vehicle', 'Life', 'House', 'further', 'proof', 'Kline', 'one', 'greatest', 'most', 'appreciated', 'actor', 'times', 'Kline', 'George', 'who', 'cancer', 'alone', 'dilapidated', 'old', 'shack', 'late', 'father', 'left', 'When', 'job', 'custody', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Sam', 'George', 'repair', 'relationship', 'son', 'too', 'late', 'Sam', 'extremely', 'troubled', 'young', 'man', 'drugs', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'blue', 'hair', 'numerous', 'piercings', 'most', 'dangerously', 'taken', 'temporarily', 'hanging', 'closet', 'bar', 'get', 'rush', 'mother', 'Robin', 'unable', 'reach', 'got', 'own', 'problems', 'dealing', 'faltering', 'marriage', 'Peter.Sounds', 'soap', 'opera', ""n't"", 'rather', 'lame', 'one', 'hands', 'able', 'actors', ""n't"", 'Kline', 'especially', 'effective', 'George', 'equally', 'adept', 'playing', 'movie', 'dramatic', 'comic', 'moments', 'hands', 'lesser', 'actor', 'revelation', 'George', 'abusive', 'childhood', 'would', 'have', 'seem', 'trite', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Kline', 'truth', 'moment', 'George', 'ca', ""n't"", 'erase', 'past', 'suddenly', 'have', 'picture', 'perfect', 'Hallmark', 'card', 'relationship', 'Sam', 'just', 'somehow', 'try', 'connect', 'kid', 'help', 'Sam', 'angry', 'was', 'own', 'dad', 'sinking', 'weight', 'own', 'anger', 'pain', 'somehow', 'break', 'cycle', 'George', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'illness', 'Robin', 'Sam', 'end', 'movie', 'fact', 'could', 'either', 'make', 'George', 'appear', 'martyr', 'bastard', 'Kline', 'simply', 'human', 'being.Kline', 'Christensen', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Kristen', 'are', 'heart', 'soul', 'center', 'movie', 'two', 'deliver', 'have', 'palpable', 'chemistry', 'play', 'believable', 'father', 'sonHayden', 'Christensen', 'revelation', 'admit', 'was', 'bit', 'awkward', 'shouted', 'too', 'much', 'angry', 'scenes', 'made', 'work', 'character', 'empathized', 'Sam', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'where', 'anger', 'came', 'type', 'character', 'often', 'clich', 'eacute', 'admittedly', 'was', 'extent', 'Christensen', 'managed', 'rise', 'gave', 'Sam', 'awkwardness', 'sadness', 'eyes', 'made', 'seem', 'vulnerable', 'real', 'especially', 'Sam', 'father', 'ambivalence', 'anger', 'never', 'completely', 'fades', 'Christensen', 'Kline', 'bring', 'real', 'depth', 'relationship', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'equally', 'good', 'many', 'roles', 'were', 'quite', 'small', 'movie', 'was', 'Sam', 'George', 'Robin', 'lesser', 'extent', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'role', 'was', 'so', 'underwritten', 'brilliant', 'actress', 'did', 'beautiful', 'job', 'scenes', 'where', 'George', 'illness', 'when', 'Kline', 'have', 'nice', 'chemistry.I', 'have', 'talk', 'flaws', 'movie', 'have', 'admit', 'riddled', 'clich', 'eacute', 'hated', 'Robin', 'fell', 'back', 'love', 'George', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'friendship', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'characters', 'needed', 'more', 'depth', 'were', 'also', 'too', 'many', 'subplots', 'movie', 'end', 'everyone', 'together', 'help', 'George', 'Sam', 'finish', 'house', 'building', ""'m"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'moments', 'movie', 'be', 'trying', 'be', 'movie', 'American', 'Beauty', ""n't"", 'work', 'are', 'moments', 'are', 'especially', 'soap', 'opera-like', 'movie', 'needed', 'stay', 'focused', 'George', 'relationships.In', 'end', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'movie', 'maybe', 'only', 'video', 'cheap', 'night', 'sheer', 'quality', 'acting', 'gorgeous', 'ocean', 'cinematography', 'soundtrack', 'make', 'plodding', 'pace', 'clich', 'eacute', 'writing']",N/A

""Life as a House"" is a metaphor of Kevin's character's life or everyone's life per se.  He lived in a weatherboard house for 25 years and he didn't have any motivation to give it any TLC (tender loving care), to much the disgruntlement of the neighbourhood (upper middle class).  The house was gifted to him by his deceased father & naturally, their relationship was estranged.  He could never reconciled the demon inside him to the extent that his wife and his grown-up son distanced themselves away from him.  Thus, the formation of a dysfunctional family.  However, he would know soon after that he's only got a few months to live due to terminal cancer.  In that short span of time, he would like to live his life, that is to build his dream home, to reconcile yet again with his family.  Gradually, as the house gotten built, we would see the transformation of those characters gradually but definitely.  The ending is predictable but the performances are outstanding.  Physically, Kevin lost much weight to add credibility to the movie.  In the making of the movie, we would be told that certain scenes were cut as logistically, they couldn't include the old house in the frame as they had already moved on to the next scenes and beyond.  It's interesting to know about Hayden's passion in acting.  He commented that Star Wars wasn't difficult to do at all as all cast would need to fit within a limited regime (I guess to accommodate the special effects).  In this instance, he would need to dig inside his awareness to get empathy of the character he was playing.  There were many TV stars in this movie, namely, Scott Bakula of Quantum Leap's fame.  There were exaggerated and funny moments but what stuck in my mind would be modern society's complexity in relationships and the yearning of humans to reach out to one another.

I've read a number of positive and negative reviews of the movie and they seem to be split along the lines of those who can get into the emotions of the characters and those who stand back and judge the events as sappy.  It might be interesting to know the ages and sexes of the reviewers.Count me in as one who loved the film.  I am a big fan of Kevin Kline.  I've never seen him give a bad performance.  Here he shines, once again, as a troubled fellow, George, whose life was given a bad start by his abusive father.  He has managed to hold down a job as a model-builder in an architect's office for twenty years but admits that he has hated every moment of it.  He seems to be a failure all over the place.  His marriage broke up ten years earlier; his beautiful wife Robin,(Kristen Scott Thomas) has moved on to a life of luxury with another man and two more children.  Sam, the son they had together is a drugged out teen who makes life miserable for everyone around him; even his mother can't stand him.  George's condition is perfectly symbolized by his unpainted shack of a house, which is the eyesore of the beautiful Malibu neighborhood.As life would have it, this depressing situation comes to a head one very bad day when George loses his job in the morning, and then collapses and hears that he only has a few months left to live.  But, in the spirit of the film ""sometimes good things come out of bad.""  At least George decides to make the most of his last months.  This takes the form, initially, of tearing down the shack and replacing it with something he would really like to build.  In the process, he re-esatablishes contact with Sam (beautifully played by Hayden Christensen), and Robin and the whole bunch which was dysfunctional in the extreme, come together in a more loving, meaningful way.I admit that even I found the ending a little too much, but if the intention of the film is to show human redemption, then it succeeded admirably.  George has broken the effects of parental neglect by refusing to pass it on to his son. Then Sam makes amends for a terrible act that George's father committed years before.  It's a wonderful story, very well acted by all the principles and definitely worth seeing.

But it is a realistic Soap Opera, and the things that happen in this story could happen to someone in real life--it's not like the things that happen on Soaps like ""Passions"" or ""General Hospital"" (even though I enjoy watching Soap Operas, most of them are pretty unrealistic).Kevin Kline stars as a middle-aged divorced man who finds out that his life is about to end. He wants to do all the things he never got a chance to do--like reconnect with his ex-wife and rebellious teenage son, and rebuild the runt-down beach shack he has near his house. LIFE AS A HOUSE is full of rollercoaster emotions.The storyline is well-written, and the performences by the entire cast is absolutely superb and flawless. Kevin Kline is in one of his best performances yet, Hayden Christensen plays Sam, the troubled rebellious teenage son. I have to say that Christensen is absolutely a wonderful young actor. He is very realistic as Sam--dressing in all black, painting his nails, and messing up his golden-blonde hair was just one of the reasons why he earned a Golden Globes nomination (and hopefully an Oscar). But the rest was all talent--he is an incredible actor, and portrayed Sam like no other. For this, I cannot wait to see him in STAR WARS-EPISODE II, ATTACK OF THE CLONES. Kirsten Scott-Thomas is also flawless as the mother of Sam.If you don't like the story, at least you should go to see LIFE AS A HOUSE for the award-winning performances.

691022,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005YUPC,Reviewer,"[95, 102]","Somebody once said that ""life"" is what happens when you're not looking.  And it's so true.  Too often we let the years slip by, and the important things slip right along with them; and it's only when something happens that we start to pay attention, and by then it's too late to do anything about it.  The good news, however, is that as long as you're still breathing there's still a chance to make amends, or at least try to.  You can try, not to make up for past mistakes (and we've all made them), but to make ""today"" count, which is what a man at a particular juncture in his life discovers and sets out to do, in ""Life As A House,"" directed by Irwin Winkler, and starring Kevin Kline.George Monroe (Kline) is an architect, a man who can design anything, with the exception of that which is the most important:  His own life.  He has a failed marriage-- now divorced for ten years from Robin (Kristin Scott Thomas)-- a failed relationship with his now sixteen-year-old son, Sam (Hayden Christensen), he's getting on in years and he's unhappy, which is driven home by circumstances involving his job and his health that make him abruptly sit up and take notice.  His ""house,"" literally and figuratively, in not in order.  And he decides to do something about it.  He's determined to tear down his old house and rebuild a new one, and he begins by arranging for Sam to come and live with him for the summer.  And it will be a summer that will affect, not only George and Sam, but Robin, and a number of others, as well; a summer in which the trivial things of life are put on hold; and for once, the important things are embraced.Working from a well written and insightful screenplay (by Mark Andrus), Winkler delivers a drama that is thoughtful and poignant (at times, even poetic), wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond.  Rich in metaphor, it's an engrossing film that works on a number of levels, and will appeal to a wide audience-- many of whom will relate to George and his situation, others who will identify with Sam; and for some, it may hit strikingly too close to home.  Whatever your personal situation is, it will fall somewhere within the emotional arc Winkler creates here; and if it doesn't now, it will eventually.  Because, as this film so trenchantly points out, ""life"" happens.  And the most important thing is knowing what to do with it-- if not the first time around, then at least before it's too late.He received an Oscar for his portrayal of Otto in the comedy ""A Fish Called Wanda,"" but Kevin Kline decidedly hits his stride in dramatic roles:  As Nathan in ""Sophie's Choice,"" Mack in ""Grand Canyon"" or Ben in ""The Ice Storm,"" for example; and now here, as George Monroe.  Kline brings George believably to life, with a performance that hints at who George was, but most importantly tells us who he is now.  With understated subtly, he conveys his inner-most feelings in a way that enables the audience to make that all-important emotional connection with the character.  He makes you feel as though you know him; and once you do, and once you meet Robin, it's hard to understand what went wrong between them all those years ago.  One can only assume that somewhere along the line youth and a lack of focus took it's toll-- understandable in a world that bombards us daily with endless stimuli.  And it's one of the subtle perspectives that makes this film so effective.Kristin Scott Thomas gives a convincing performance, as well, as Robin, a woman who has moved on with her life, but in whom you can discern a certain dissatisfaction with her current situation.  On the surface, her life seems agreeable, but we see through her portrayal that it is still lacking in some regard.  She seems happy to some extent, but it's more like the unfulfilled happiness that comes when one has ""settled"" for something.  You get the sense that what she has with her current husband, Peter (Jamey Sheridan), is somehow less than what she had with George, at least at some point or other.  Thomas does a good job of indicating the complexities of her character, dipping beneath the surface to make what could have been a one-note character alive and interesting.One of the real rewards of this film, however, is found in the wonderfully affecting performance of young Hayden Christensen, as Sam.  With but a few TV appearances and a handful of unremarkable films to his credit (the exception being a part in Sophia Coppola's ""The Virgin Suicides""), Christensen is virtually an unknown, but comes through with some extremely impressive work here.  He not only finds, but manages to convey, that turmoil of confusion and need for personal identity that every teenager experiences, and he presents it quite naturally and effectively.  There's nothing feigned or pretentious about him; the Sam he delivers comes from somewhere deep down inside, and working from the inside out makes him very real and believable.  It's a performance that should jump-start his career, which is about to be catapulted into high gear/high profile status when ""Star Wars:  Episode 2, Attack of the Clones"" hits the screen, in which he plays the role of Anakin Skywalker.  And because of the magnitude of that film and all that goes along with it, he will never receive the acclaim he deserves, no matter how good a job he does in it; so it's important that he has this film under his belt, which demonstrates what a truly gifted young actor he really is, a fact that may be overlooked once ""Clones"" hits (which is what happened to Leonardo DiCaprio after ""Titanic"").  And Christensen's performance here is a big part of what makes ""Life As A House"" a winner.",4,"When ""Life"" Happens",1021161600,"05 12, 2002",2002,5686,"['Somebody', 'once', 'said', 'life', 'what',

""Life as a House"" is not as good as some, but holds its own in many ways. First is the glorious cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond, another feather in his many-feathered cap. The script also is better than many critics thought; I didn't see sappy moments, as much as I noticed renewal and re-growth of the human spirit. There was little pity involved, rather anger and confusion, more natural reactions I thought. Kevin Kline is in touch quite well, with fine insight about what needs to done. Kristin Scott Thomas finally has a role that is equal to her Oscar-nominated performance in ""The English Patient"", a renewed appreciation of things lost. The always excellent Jena Malone shines brightly as a new version of the hippie girl I used to know so well. And it's award winning Hayden Christensen who shows range, depth and redemption in this new found project with his father (and Malone). As he says in a DVD extra, doing ""Star Wars"" didn't involve as much preparation because everyone knew what those characters were about. Here, he is as complex as they get; a teen who knows everything but knows nothing (like most teens). His teen angst is well-examined, and presented quite well. (The SAG  thought so, too, as well as Kline.) There's plenty of humor to counteract the pathos. I enjoyed it a lot. Irwin Winkler has crafted a fine film. I few interesting DVD extras. I'm looking for another interesting performance from young Mr. Christensen. I hope the smart people can tap his resources for other fine performances.",5,Getting rid of excess baggage...,1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,1601,"['are', 'lots', 'films', 'involving', 'person', 'reflection', 'own', 'mortality', 'Life', 'House', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'own', 'many', 'ways', 'First', 'glorious', 'cinematography', 'Vilmos', 'Zsigmond', 'feather', 'many-feathered', 'cap', 'script', 'also', 'better', 'many', 'critics', 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'sappy', 'moments', 'as', 'much', 'noticed', 'renewal', 're-growth', 'human', 'spirit', 'was', 'little', 'pity', 'involved', 'rather', 'anger', 'confusion', 'more', 'natural', 'reactions', 'thought', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'touch', 'quite', 'well', 'fine', 'insight', 'what', 'done', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'finally', 'role', 'equal', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'English', 'Patient', 'renewed', 'appreciation', 'things', 'lost', 'always', 'excellent', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'brightly', 'new', 'version', 'hippie', 'girl', 'used', 'know', 'so', 'well', 'award', 'winning', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'who', 'range', 'depth', 'redemption', 'new', 'found', 'project', 'father', 'Malone', 'DVD', 'extra', 'doing', 'Star', 'Wars', 'did', ""n't"", 'involve', 'as', 'much', 'preparation', 'everyone', 'knew', 'what', 'characters', 'were', 'about', 'Here', 'as', 'complex', 'get', 'teen', 'who', 'everything', 'nothing', 'most', 'teens', 'teen', 'angst', 'well-examined', 'presented', 'quite', 'well', 'SAG', 'thought', 'so', 'too', 'as', 'well', 'Kline', 'plenty', 'humor', 'counteract', 'pathos', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'Irwin', 'Winkler', 'crafted', 'fine', 'film', 'few', 'interesting', 'DVD', 'extras', ""'m"", 'looking', 'interesting', 'performance', 'young', 'Mr.', 'Christensen', 'hope', 'smart', 'people', 'can', 'tap', 'resources', 'other', 'fine', 'performances']",N/A

Kline lives his hum-drum life divorced from Kristin Scott-Thomas and estranged from his wild, and usually ...up, 16 year old son Hayden Christensen (from Star Wars).  When Kline gets fired from his job he collapses outside the building and finds himself in a hospital with only a few months to live due to cancer.  Without telling his ex-wife or son he decides to turn his shack of a house into the house he always wanted over the summer with the reluctant help of his son.  As the project ensues, and as he eventually becomes sicker, the house project becomes a family project.  This movie will leave you with hope, as much as it is sad, it is uplifting.

691036,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00005YUPC,Steven Reynolds,"[2, 2]","With a dangerously corny title, and a few lines which ram home the central metaphor just a little too strongly, it would be easy to hate this film. Trouble is, it's just so damn endearing. Sure, the story unfolds with an easy predictability, and it's at least as emotionally manipulative as any other terminal illness film. But as the patient declines and his relationships recover, it's the light touch of the three lead actors who manage to pull this high-risk weepy back from the brink. Kevin Kline is perfectly unsentimental in a role which, on paper, must have been crying out for Kevin Spacey or Harrison Ford. But in the scenes that really mattered, Kline's warm and understated performance had me thanking God that neither of them got his part. Kristin Scott Thomas has never been more convincing. And Hayden Christensen proves definitively that his performance in 'Attack Of The Clones' was, like the rest of that film, an abomination for which we can blame George Lucas. (The kid had me crying in both movies - but for entirely different reasons!) This is easily the best film Irwin Winkler has directed, and Mark Andrus' script, despite some obvious flaws and occasional mawkishness, for my money still beats his overrated 'As Good As It Gets' hands down.

691039,A21JAP6EO4J5RW,B00005YUPC,The END.,"[3, 3]","It seems that viewing a dysfunctional family always entertains. (Come on! The Ozzbournes?!) Maybe it's because it dreadfully reminds you of your own or maybe it's because it shows just how much better your family actually is. Anyway, this is what the movie's all about. It's about rebuilding and renovating the people around you. Becoming what you should've become later in life. Kind of the same concept of the long time cancelled television show Home Improvement. The message here is much more heartfelt.George (Kevin Kline), a man living in a dumpy old shack on the edge of a rocky shore, is fired from his hated job. Not only does he hate his job, he happens to hate his home as well. Actually he mentions hating many things. He soon decides to tear it down, and build something better. His ex-wife Robin (Kristin Scott Thomas) lives in a huge, modern home with her present husband and their kids. Sam, (Hayden Christensen),her blue-haired, 'thumbtack in chin' son from the previous marriage, feels nothing of himself. His first scene was perfect as an introduction to his character. The first thing he does when he gets up in the morning was hang himself in his closet. Unfortunately for him, it didn't quite work. What the deal is here, is how Robin doesn't really know how to discipline her 16-year-old son. She just let's him isolate himself and ignores his yelling.As summer begins, George decides to take Sam for the entire summer to aid in building the house. After a few funny moments between the somewhat strangered father and son, the bittersweet repairing of their family qualities begin. Just as in real life, in this movie, you'll have to take the good results with the unfair ones.With more strangely wonderful characters such as George's neighbors and Sam's drug dealing sidekick Josh, this movie gives more laughs than tears, and it gives you lots of tears. The highlight of this film would definitely be Hayden's impressive and captivating performance. Sam was so hardcore, but also very passionately sensitive. A beautiful character for a beautifully made movie.note: This would be a perfect movie for family if it weren't for two brief sex scenes.

691040,A1E0RPGCXS4L2G,B00005YUPC,TheHighlander,"[2, 2]","Kevin Kline plays the lead character in this outstanding movie about life, love and families.  Kevin's character gets fired and later that day finds out he has terminal cancer.  In the mean time his son (Hayden Christensen) is in an emotional void, drifting away from his mother and siblings.  Kristen Scott-Thomas plays the exwife who is remarried and unhappy with her new husband's lack of emotional support, even though he is rich, which shows money can not buy love.  So Dad and son move in together for the summer.  To destroy the old house, and memories, and create a new house and hope for the future.The story line is somewhat predictible but the acting is superb.  With great performances by all including Scott Bakula, Hayden Christensen, Kristen Scott-Thomas.  The top performances, in my opinion, go to Kevin Kline, Jena Malone and Hayden Christensen.  Jena plays the girl next door who had hoped her mother would marry Kevin's character and he would then become her father.  Hayden Christensen does a fine job with the transformation his character must go through, from an emotional void to a caring person.  From a trouble teen, to a fine young man.I have heard folks compare this movie to a soap opera.  There is a lot of subplots and supporting character interactions in the movie and it moves along just fine, keeping you very interested.  I can't compare it to a soap opera as I do not watch them.

691042,A1K2ACRU9YJS17,B00005YUPC,"Tsila Sofer Elguez ""Tsila Sofer Elguez""","[0, 0]","This is an interesting, thought provoking movie to watch in spite of its many problems that can destroy some of the ""logical"" pleasure of the movie, but indeed not the ""emotional"" pleasure.Several things about the story are not totally comprehensible and many issues are glued together for the ""Hollywood sake"". First of all - the viewer or at least THIS viewer does not really understand what was SO bad in George's former life. George claims to have hated his work, working for 20 years in the same company and to have suffered all his life from living in an unwanted house.  Although we understand that George ""did not move up with times"" and did not learn how to use the computer, his job as an architect seemed to me to have been quite creative (at least from the models he formed) and basically not one of the worst jobs. His house indeed was not as fancy as the other houses in the street, however is located in an astounding place on top of a cliff with a beautiful view and seemed to be just the right house for a person sick of the modern life abuses. The movie starts with George waking up in the morning, urinating to the ocean and to me that was just the ""natural, free living"" George seemed to want to achieve. Or maybe, the house was hated because it was so full of bad memories? maybe that is the answer.The viewer is also unable to understand what made George neglect his growing beloved son. Is this the first time George notices the stress signs his son is throwing out to the world? What happened in the last 10 years? All these questions are not fully answered.  The metaphor is supposed to be ""You are what you live in"" - which again seems incomprehensible to me. After all, to the end of the movie, George builds a beautiful house, but one that is as nouveu riche as all the other houses around - OK, maybe a prettier one...but still, a house that seems quite expensive. I guess we are supposed to appreciate that one has to follow his dream and to regret the fact that one (George) needs to wait to the end of their days to fulfill his dreams. Also, that building with your hands is always better then having something ready for you.... It is clear that a shock in one's life makes you realize what's important and too bad you did not see this before. Indeed all these messages do come through but they are somewhat shoved in your face...Another serious problem is the producers need to squeeze all possible problems (and their solutions!) to one movie. We not only have a dying man building his house (achieved!) but also a divorce in the past, understanding your past mistakes, a history of a bad father son relationship with traumatic memories (solved!) and a drug problem (solved!). Many other reviewers have written about the ""Hollywood"" effect of the sex scenes. I thought the movie is quite Hollywoodish (did you notice how the problem with the neighbor is quickly solved?) but not because of the sex scenes. I actually thought that the sex scenes were only hinted. It is true that the movie deals with a lot of sexual issues but I am not going to close my eyes and pretend they do not exist in our world. Also, no body parts are shown and I felt that the bath scenes were quite innocent and dealt with the searching and getting to know teenage sex. George's relationship with his ex wife was very tender and heartbreaking.  In spite of all I wrote above I did enjoy the viewing and the acting of the wonderful Kevin Kline and Kristin Scott-Thomas.",4,Interesting to watch in spite of many problems,1056240000,"06 22, 2003",2003,3479,"['interesting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'movie', 'watch', 'spite', 'many', 'problems', 'can', 'destroy', 'logical', 'pleasure', 'movie', 'indeed', 'not', 'emotional', 'pleasure.Several', 'things', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'totally', 'comprehensible', 'many', 'issues', 'are', 'glued', 'together', 'Hollywood', 'sake', 'First', 'viewer', 'least', 'THIS', 'viewer', 'not', 'really', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'SO', 'bad', 'George', 'former', 'life', 'George', 'have', 'hated', 'work', 'working', '20', 'years', 'same', 'company', 'have', 'suffered', 'life', 'living', 'unwanted', 'house', 'understand', 'George', 'did', 'not', 'move', 'up', 'times', 'did', 'not', 'learn', 'how', 'use', 'computer', 'job', 'architect', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'creative', 'least', 'models', 'formed', 'basically', 'not', 'one', 'worst', 'jobs', 'house', 'indeed', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'fancy', 'other', 'houses', 'street', 'however', 'located', 'astounding', 'place', 'top', 'cliff', 'beautiful', 'view', 'seemed', 'be', 'just', 'right', 'house', 'person', 'sick', 'modern', 'life', 'abuses', 'movie', 'George', 'waking', 'up', 'morning', 'urinating', 'ocean', 'was', 'just', 'natural', 'free', 'living', 'George', 'seemed', 'want', 'achieve', 'maybe', 'house', 'was', 'hated', 'was', 'so', 'full', 'bad', 'memories', 'maybe', 'answer.The', 'viewer', 'also', 'unable', 'understand', 'what', 'made', 'George', 'neglect', 'growing', 'beloved', 'son', 'first', 'time', 'George', 'stress', 'signs', 'son', 'throwing', 'out', 'world', 'What', 'happened', 'last', '10', 'years', 'questions', 'are', 'not', 'fully', 'answered', 'metaphor', 'supposed', 'be', 'are', 'what', 'live', 'again', 'incomprehensible', 'end', 'movie', 'George', 'beautiful', 'house', 'one', 'nouveu', 'riche', 'other', 'houses', 'OK', 'maybe', 'prettier', 'one', 'still', 'house', 'quite', 'expensive', 'guess', 'are', 'supposed', 'appreciate', 'one', 'follow', 'dream', 'regret', 'fact', 'one', 'George', 'wait', 'end', 'days', 'fulfill', 'dreams', 'Also', 'building', 'hands', 'always', 'better', 'then', 'having', 'something', 'ready', 'clear', 'shock', 'one', 'life', 'realize', 'what', 'important', 'too', 'bad', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'Indeed', 'messages', 'do', 'come', 'are', 'somewhat', 'shoved', 'face', 'serious', 'problem', 'producers', 'need', 'squeeze', 'possible', 'problems', 'solutions', 'one', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'dying', 'man', 'building', 'house', 'achieved', 'also', 'divorce', 'past', 'understanding', 'past', 'mistakes', 'history', 'bad', 'father', 'son', 'relationship', 'traumatic', 'memories', 'solved', 'drug', 'problem', 'solved', 'Many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'written', 'Hollywood', 'effect', 'sex', 'scenes', 'thought', 'movie', 'quite', 'Hollywoodish', 'did', 'notice', 'how', 'problem', 'neighbor', 'quickly', 'solved', 'not', 'sex', 'scenes', 'actually', 'thought', 'sex', 'scenes', 'were', 'only', 'hinted', 'true', 'movie', 'deals', 'lot', 'sexual', 'issues', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'close', 'eyes', 'pretend', 'do', 'not', 'exist', 'world', 'Also', 'body', 'parts', 'are', 'shown', 'felt', 'bath', 'scenes', 'were', 'quite', 'innocent', 'dealt', 'searching', 'getting', 'know', 'teenage', 'sex', 'George', 'relationship', 'ex', 'wife', 'was', 'very', 'tender', 'heartbreaking', 'spite', 'wrote', 'did', 'enjoy', 'viewing', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Kristin', 'Scott-Thomas']",N/A
691043,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005YUPC,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 7]","""Life as a House"" is a film that divides opinions among people.  Critics would find faults with the entire film, rightly pointing out predictable story of the film.  But non-critic audience, not least those fans with taste for tearjerkers, would definitely love it, simply because of what it is -- its story.  But that is no surprise, considering Irwin Winkler's past record as director -- not-so-suspenceful ""The Net"" comes to my mind first -- but most of all, as you know, as producer he once made a very popular film called ""Rocky,"" and though Sly didn't win the bout, you knew you would cry in the end while watchinghis fight with Apollo.In a nutshell, this is a story about family.  Kevin Kline is living alone in a dirty, old house until one day he knows that his life is not long, so visits his long-estranged son Hayden Christensen and ex-wife Kristin Scott Thomas, proposing to re-build his house during the summer.  Hayden naturally dislikes his dad who long neglected him, or everything around him, but reluctantly comes to live with him (partly because in the neighborhood he finds a beautiful girl Jena Malone), helping rebuild the house, or his own life.  The story gradually leads you to the obvious conclusion, re-union of family (or psuedo-family) members surrounding Kevin Kline.The film goes on a path which has been already known by other past masterpieces like ""Terms of Endearment.""  Those who have seen this Jack Nicolson - Shirley McLaine film can claim that similarity between this and ""Life as a House"" (jumping into the ocean, unexpected love, and death by disease, etc.) and also the weakness of the latter, which is, the lack of emotional power coming from smooth storytelling.  Though ""Life as a House"" has its moment, especially between Kline and Scott Thomas, we can have an impression that some other episodes look either forced and labored, or too simple and obvious.  Mary Steenburgen's character has a love affair with a boy in a too unbelievable way, unnecessarily trying to make a certain scene very comical, and Kline's bickering neighbor attempts to sue him in an most awkward moment, when his family's emotional bond should be given more close-up descriptions.  Or Christensen, though himself good, is reduced to a hackneyed image of troubled teen who locks up himself in the room, listening Marylin Manson on stereo with loud volume.  Unoriginal, isn't it?  Director Winkler does have good ingredints, but he doens't seem to know how to cook and  arrange them.The whole film as a consequence relies on actors' superb performance, and the result is not bad.  Actually, Kevin Kilne is so crebible as an ailing architect that you will forget that the script is not so original for all its good intention.  Also Chrisenten is good, showing that he anyway didn't need the role of Anakin to be recognized.  But as a moviegoer who have seen so many Hollywood films, I can say that I have seen the story before, and in a better way.

Kevin Kline seems to be the same in all his movies - this film actually reminded me of him in ""Grand Canyon"".'My Life As A House' comprises a selection of odd characters who end up helping a dying man build a house he should have built many years before.  By the end of the movie, I cared no more for this character or his ""wayward son come good"".  The characters just didn't have enough spark to make me feel any compassion for them.I realise that reviews will discuss the special meanings of this movie - such as the importance of family, the need to follow your dreams, good health etc etc, but you will be none the wiser after watching this typical American family crisis movie.Yawn!",2,Yawn!,1042502400,"01 14, 2003",2003,831,"[""'re"", 'watching', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'predictable', 'boring', 'family', 'drama', 'basically', 'what', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'be', 'same', 'movies', 'film', 'actually', 'reminded', 'Grand', 'Canyon', ""'My"", 'Life', 'A', 'House', 'selection', 'odd', 'characters', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'helping', 'dying', 'man', 'build', 'house', 'should', 'have', 'built', 'many', 'years', 'end', 'movie', 'cared', 'more', 'character', 'wayward', 'son', 'come', 'good', 'characters', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'spark', 'make', 'feel', 'compassion', 'them.I', 'realise', 'will', 'discuss', 'special', 'meanings', 'movie', 'such', 'importance', 'family', 'need', 'follow', 'dreams', 'good', 'health', 'etc', 'etc', 'will', 'be', 'none', 'wiser', 'watching', 'typical', 'American', 'family', 'crisis', 'movie.Yawn']",N/A

But one part of this movie really moved me and it wasn't the cliched one either. When Sam feels such a strong need for drugs he goes into gay prostitution I was moved inexplicably to tears. This scene just related to my philoshipies in life and I just sat there with tears streaming down my face! Hayden does a wonderful job he is truly a class A actor. And some of the writing is funny because it is obvious what they are referring to without necesarrily showing things such as in the shower scenes!,5,I don't often cry at movies....,1027814400,"07 28, 2002",2002,660,"['am', 'odd', 'duck', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'tend', 'move', 'tears', 'once', 'awhile', 'will', 'get', 'totally', 'cliched', 'spot', 'when', 'small', 'child', 'killed', 'one', 'part', 'movie', 'really', 'moved', 'was', ""n't"", 'cliched', 'one', 'either', 'When', 'Sam', 'feels', 'such', 'strong', 'need', 'drugs', 'gay', 'prostitution', 'was', 'moved', 'inexplicably', 'tears', 'scene', 'just', 'related', 'philoshipies', 'life', 'just', 'sat', 'tears', 'streaming', 'down', 'face', 'Hayden', 'wonderful', 'job', 'truly', 'class', 'actor', 'writing', 'funny', 'obvious', 'what', 'are', 'referring', 'necesarrily', 'showing', 'things', 'such', 'shower', 'scenes']",N/A
