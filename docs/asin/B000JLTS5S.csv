Malagrin,"[2, 2]","All the Winters That Have BeenA great love story with Richard Chamberlain, Karen Allen an Hal Holbrook giving believable and moving performances. It has drama and romance.Chamberlain, after betrayal 20 years earlier of his love, Karen Allen and her Eskimo family, comes back to the region to see his dying uncle. At first, Karen does not want to see him, but later, they get back together. But, what Chamberlain does not know, and what has never been told to him, is that he has a son who is grown up and had been raised by Karen and her husband, who later had died. This is where the drama comes. Does Karen tell Chamberalin about the son, which may upset the son who loved his adopted father, or not?A great sentimental love story.",4,A Moving Love Story,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,733,"['Winters', 'Have', 'BeenA', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'Karen', 'Allen', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'giving', 'believable', 'moving', 'performances', 'drama', 'romance.Chamberlain', 'betrayal', '20', 'years', 'earlier', 'love', 'Karen', 'Allen', 'Eskimo', 'family', 'back', 'region', 'see', 'dying', 'uncle', 'first', 'Karen', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'later', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'what', 'Chamberlain', 'not', 'know', 'never', 'been', 'told', 'son', 'who', 'grown', 'up', 'had', 'been', 'raised', 'Karen', 'husband', 'who', 'later', 'had', 'died', 'where', 'drama', 'Does', 'Karen', 'tell', 'Chamberalin', 'son', 'may', 'upset', 'son', 'who', 'loved', 'adopted', 'father', 'not', 'A', 'great', 'sentimental', 'love', 'story']",All The Winters That Have Been

Not the kind of a movie that is a box office smash but a quiet movie that makes you think about age, where you are in life, the past and future. Beautiful photography. I don't want to relate the plot before you view the movie. Do view this movie. No loud bangs and special effect just a quiet thoughtful movie.",4,Love Chamberlain,1202428800,"02 8, 2008",2008,407,"['am', 'huge', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'fan', 'had', 'host', 'excellent', 'players', 'too', 'like', 'Karen', 'Allen', 'Not', 'kind', 'movie', 'box', 'office', 'smash', 'quiet', 'movie', 'think', 'age', 'where', 'are', 'life', 'past', 'future', 'Beautiful', 'photography', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'relate', 'plot', 'view', 'movie', 'Do', 'view', 'movie', 'loud', 'bangs', 'special', 'effect', 'just', 'quiet', 'thoughtful', 'movie']",All The Winters That Have Been
