It was interesting how the show went from black & white to color and how the events unfolded as they happened. I have seen bits and pieces of this footage over the years but it nice to see more coverage of events for example, when Kennedy was in Fort Worth giving his speech or the interviews of the Dallas police and the witnesses of the shooting. Was interesting to see how live television broadcast the news live back then. I was only 5 when JFK was killed, so I barely remember the events, although I seem to remember watching the funeral on tv with my parents. This show will not settle the debate between the lone assassin and the conspiracy buffs, but if you want to see a piece of history as it actually happened, this DVD is a excellent source, though tragic and sad.",5,Award Winning Footage,1301011200,"03 25, 2011",2011,833,"['Excellent', 'DVD', 'containing', 'unseen', 'footage', 'years', 'past', 'was', 'interesting', 'how', 'show', 'went', 'black', 'white', 'color', 'how', 'events', 'unfolded', 'happened', 'have', 'seen', 'bits', 'pieces', 'footage', 'years', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'coverage', 'events', 'example', 'when', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'Fort', 'Worth', 'giving', 'speech', 'interviews', 'Dallas', 'police', 'witnesses', 'shooting', 'Was', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'live', 'television', 'news', 'live', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'only', '5', 'when', 'JFK', 'was', 'killed', 'barely', 'remember', 'events', 'seem', 'remember', 'watching', 'funeral', 'tv', 'parents', 'show', 'will', 'not', 'settle', 'debate', 'lone', 'assassin', 'conspiracy', 'buffs', 'want', 'see', 'piece', 'history', 'actually', 'happened', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'source', 'tragic', 'sad']",N/A

This is a minute by minute account of Nov 22., but then it stretches out for the aftermath, bringing us through the growth of conspiracy theories, as they spread like a virus in the years after the assassination. Marvelous local Dallas TV footage, showing eyewitnesses soon after the shooting, newsmen smoking on camera and things being thrown onto the desks on live TV as the reporters try to keep up with the racing events of that weekend. Fantastic soundtrack adds to the grave drama unfolding, as we watch again as Oswald is assassinated by Jack Ruby in the basement of the courthouse near the site of the presidential killing two days before.

1283285,A396SBGKAOLTZE,B002PTVMWO,Chris Aldridge,"[1, 1]","Though it is a relatively fresh documentary from 2009, I'd gone into this certain I'd seen this TV special before- but perhaps that is because hundreds of Kennedy-assassination-speculatives have been done since virtually the beginning of this 49-year-old tragedy. But this one separates itself from the lineup almost immediately, with all real footage of Kennedy and told in almost all real-time; there are no God-awful reenactments which are supposed to represent the actual history (the stuff we are so often subjected to in storm chaser videos and such). This special- especially for the first 25 minutes- is absolutely amazing: plain black boarders with a teletype clock click minute-by-minute as the events of November 22, 1963 unfold: Kennedy's breakfast speech in Fort Worth, a quick flight to Love Field in Dallas, and the start of the motorcade into Dealey Plaza. And all the images are true documentary: black-and-white and color film- both newsreel and home movies- interspersed with some fantastic quality 2-inch b&w; videotape, a medium which was still relatively new in 1963.And then, perhaps the most genius edit of all: the moment the cars turn onto that small expressway past the Texas Book Depository at the strike of 12:30 pm CST, the scene switches *not* to the famous Zapruder film that we all know, but to the start of ""As The World Turns,"" in monochrome videotape, with the first CBS Bulletin (voiced by an off-camera Walter Cronkite) interrupting the soap opera- just as it had 49 years ago.Not seeing the event actually made this more frightening to watch.When the action resumes from the bulletin interruption, the cars have already begun their sprint to the hospital, but we already know it will be to no avail. A few minutes later, the docudrama gives the same treatment on the ABC network, as a ladies' fashion show (also in its original black-and-white videotape) is interrupted by ABC/WFAA's ""out-of-breath"" program director Jay Watson. (Watson's ABC footage, it seems, is given more air time than the CBS Cronkite footage- perhaps because Cronkite's now famous on-camera reaction had been aired many times before.) Incredibly, horribly, it's all over at the strike of 1:00 pm, just a scant 30 minutes after it began, as the death knell tolls all over the country and the world falls into sorrow. Almost without a break, we are then given a minute-by minute blow of the antics of Lee Harvey (Harold?) Oswald- arrested almost immediately and transferred to what looks like the police station's night court. But by the time we can begin to process his back story, he, too, is gunned down by Jack Ruby (nee' Rubenstein)- this even caught on both film AND videotape. The remainder of the docudrama, somewhat predictably, delves into the never-ending Warren Commission analysis of what really happened to the president, and the ensuing speculation as to whether or not there was more than one assassin- a speculation that continues to this day. For 4 grueling hours we are transplanted into a block of time, the events of which seemed to have happened in a matter of minutes. And, echoing a famous newsreel from the 1960's, we are there.",4,You are there- as the networks would say.,1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,3163,"['relatively', 'fresh', 'documentary', '2009', ""'d"", 'gone', 'certain', ""'d"", 'seen', 'TV', 'special', 'before-', 'perhaps', 'hundreds', 'Kennedy-assassination-speculatives', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'virtually', 'beginning', '49-year-old', 'tragedy', 'one', 'lineup', 'almost', 'immediately', 'real', 'footage', 'Kennedy', 'told', 'almost', 'real-time', 'are', 'God-awful', 'reenactments', 'are', 'supposed', 'represent', 'actual', 'history', 'stuff', 'are', 'so', 'often', 'subjected', 'storm', 'chaser', 'videos', 'such', 'special-', 'especially', 'first', '25', 'minutes-', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'plain', 'black', 'boarders', 'teletype', 'clock', 'click', 'minute-by-minute', 'events', 'November', '22', '1963', 'unfold', 'Kennedy', 'breakfast', 'speech', 'Fort', 'Worth', 'quick', 'flight', 'Love', 'Field', 'Dallas', 'start', 'motorcade', 'Dealey', 'Plaza', 'images', 'are', 'true', 'documentary', 'black-and-white', 'color', 'film-', 'newsreel', 'home', 'movies-', 'interspersed', 'fantastic', 'quality', '2-inch', 'b', 'w', 'videotape', 'medium', 'was', 'still', 'relatively', 'new', '1963.And', 'then', 'perhaps', 'most', 'genius', 'edit', 'moment', 'cars', 'turn', 'small', 'expressway', 'Texas', 'Book', 'Depository', 'strike', '12:30', 'pm', 'CST', 'scene', '*not*', 'famous', 'Zapruder', 'film', 'know', 'start', 'World', 'Turns', 'monochrome', 'videotape', 'first', 'CBS', 'Bulletin', 'voiced', 'off-camera', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'interrupting', 'soap', 'opera-', 'just', 'had', '49', 'years', 'ago.Not', 'seeing', 'event', 'actually', 'made', 'more', 'frightening', 'watch.When', 'action', 'bulletin', 'interruption', 'cars', 'have', 'already', 'begun', 'sprint', 'hospital', 'already', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'avail', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'docudrama', 'same', 'treatment', 'ABC', 'network', 'ladies', 'fashion', 'show', 'also', 'original', 'black-and-white', 'videotape', 'interrupted', 'ABC/WFAA', 'out-of-breath', 'program', 'director', 'Jay', 'Watson', 'Watson', 'ABC', 'footage', 'given', 'more', 'air', 'time', 'CBS', 'Cronkite', 'footage-', 'perhaps', 'Cronkite', 'now', 'famous', 'on-camera', 'reaction', 'had', 'been', 'aired', 'many', 'times', 'Incredibly', 'horribly', 'over', 'strike', '1:00', 'pm', 'just', 'scant', '30', 'minutes', 'began', 'death', 'knell', 'country', 'world', 'sorrow', 'Almost', 'break', 'are', 'then', 'given', 'minute-by', 'minute', 'blow', 'antics', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Harold', 'Oswald-', 'arrested', 'almost', 'immediately', 'transferred', 'what', 'police', 'station', 'night', 'court', 'time', 'can', 'begin', 'process', 'back', 'story', 'too', 'gunned', 'down', 'Jack', 'Ruby', 'nee', 'Rubenstein', 'even', 'caught', 'film', 'videotape', 'remainder', 'docudrama', 'somewhat', 'predictably', 'never-ending', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'analysis', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'president', 'ensuing', 'speculation', 'not', 'was', 'more', 'one', 'assassin-', 'speculation', 'day', '4', 'grueling', 'hours', 'are', 'transplanted', 'block', 'time', 'events', 'seemed', 'have', 'happened', 'matter', 'minutes', 'echoing', 'famous', 'newsreel', '1960', 'are', 'there']",N/A
1283286,A35FC3DWA1M79H,B002PTVMWO,Christopher,"[18, 68]","I had to watch this when it debuted on the ""History"" Channel.  The first things that caught my attention with captions of time and place and the use of real footage to tell the story - without narration.  To anyone who never saw this they may think that it was great, but people like me who watched ""Evidence of Revision"" knew right away that this was a rebuttal of those actual facts - ALL of the facts.Before I saw it I assumed one thing to be take place which The ""History"" Channel has proven in the past it follows - the lone nut, Oswald did it (for reasons unknown, and who cares?) slat on the event.  It uses much of the footage taken from the underground, non-biased EOR, but adds in some footage that goes away from conspiracy, even a guy on the street who says: ""it must have been a Communist.""  I admit from the footage I saw of the event, I never saw anyone but the government talk about the Commies did it, so that was something to see.  However, looking at the original EOR, it is more than clear that it was a conspiracy WITH the footage (that the ""History"" Channel left out)to show not only conspiracy, but when the plan went off script, how they, via the media had to adjust.  Whether it was about a Mauser being found (EOR shows MANY instances of footage to show them saying Mauser as to show that it was not error when announced) and then changed to the Carcano.  EOR shows how people already suspected conspiracy and that Ruby and Oswald knew each other.This video is only good for some other rare footage and a lot of color footage.  It is clearly the right wings answer to the underground, powerful series ""Evidence of Revision"" which they STOLE their format, but changed the outcome.  As EOR says: ""History is being revised even as it is being written"" and they SHOW you.  This video only brainwashes you and wants you to know two things - JFK was killed, Oswald did it and you need to forget about it.If you are new to the JFK assassination, this will convince you of only Oswald did it without suggestion of anyone else.  The fact that the try to go there when the facts are clear show that the conspiracy was clear and that those who run The ""History"" Channel are in bed with those who killed JFK.  It also goes to show that it must have been right-wingers or else they would not keep trying to pin it on the left.  Right-wingers hated JFK then and they still talk bad about him and are glad he was killed today.  When Ted died, they talked bad about him on the day of his funeral!

1283287,AVQLXZ04FK0UV,B002PTVMWO,"Classic Movie Fan ""Classic Movie Fan""","[106, 112]","I have added additional comments below my original review here.It's a shame that one reviewer here chose to review the content of this documentary as if its presentation is completely unimportant.  I believe he missed the point.  It's not about whether Oswald acted alone.  It is a presentation of the moment.  If you don't know, this film is ALL actual footage of news pieces about the JFK assassination as they unfolded.  Nicole Rittenmeyer and Seth Skundrick have painstakingly put together a chronological video record of what was being broadcast at the time, some local, some national, some news reports, some interviews, some film of JFK's breakfast speech.  The ""voice"" of this film is the ""voice"" at that time.  No narration.  A few carefully worded captions.In my opinion, this is one of the best documentaries ever made because of what it doesn't do -- it doesn't add superfluous opinions of all the Monday-morning quarterbacks who have analyzed these events for the past 45 years.  It's about as close as a person can come to being in America on November 22, 1963.I am now 57-years old.  I was 12 on that day.  Even though I was a child I have a vivid memory of that day and the weeks that followed.  My ""carefree"" American childhood changed dramatically because of this event. It really did change America.  Up until then it was unthinkable that a President could be killed in modern-day America.  I have a small Brownie photo of JFK at Oakland Naval Air Station waving from a limo a few months before.  He saw me with my camera and specifically waved to me.  Wow! A President.  Any President.If you are younger than about 57, then face it, you were too young to experience this event from an adult perspective -- if you were even born then.  This film will definitely show you what it was like to be in America on November 22, 1963.  Forget the ""politics"" and watch this film.  It is brilliant.Added comments:  (Added 8/7/2013)I am now 61-years old -- as one commenter pointed out, I was 11, not 12 in November 1963 -- ah, old age got me again!I moved in with my father to take care of him before his death 2 1/2 years ago.  There were some documentaries -- including this one -- being broadcast about JFK.  I asked my father if he wanted to watch any of them.  His exact words, ""No.  It still makes me mad.""  There you have it.  Did it ""change"" him?  Absolutely.  My father never shirked away from anything.  He was an orphan at 10, his grandmother and brother's sole support at 19.  He joined the Navy to provide for them instead of signing a minor league baseball contract.  But he was visibly upset at age 89 at the thought of what happened that day.Watch this documentary and go back in time.

On the one hand, I appreciate the opportunity to see so many clips that occurred at the time.On the other hand (and this almost had me give a 1 star), there are so many people who are shown and not identified--particularly the national newscasters who could have easily been ID'd with some research.  Also foreign broadcasters who say interesting things are unidentified. Often people like Police Chief Curry speak and are not identified. This is very frustrating when one is doing research about this.Also frustrating? The editing out of controversial moments, like the call back of SS riding on the bumper of the president's car when he left Love Field. That is a key moment, yet it's not shown here. Nor is the Zapruder film--there is no film, no still photo, of the actual assassination or even of the motorcade once it reached Main--Houston--Elm. The film of the search of the inside of the Depository was interesting, and the film of Oswald being asked questions is important. But the first hour is disappointing, including where they show Bobby Kennedy at the 1964 convention when he stands to give a speech about JFK--only the filmmakers do not show a word of the speech, only showing a title slide that says &#34;Delegates applauded for 22 minutes&#34;.However, the film is four hours long, showing elements of the investigations after the assassination, showing the making of JFK, including a discussion of the &#34;pristine bullet&#34;, one of the most troubling pieces of evidence.This is long and there is no narrative explanation or interpretation. I'm sure it was a great deal of work to compile all of this and that, in itself, is of great value.  I may come back to give it four stars, but with the lack of ID (and lack of so many important speeches--LBJ, Bobby,etc.)right now I can't.

I remember going home from school early finding my mom riveted to the black and white TV.  Just being 8 years old, I did not understand the importance of what had happened that day.  Now, with this 3 hour dvd, I can see what my mom and dad watched all that fateful weekend.The assassination events literally unfold step by step, starting with President Kennedy's breakfast in Fort Worth, where we see Jackie Kennedy introduced in her pink wool suit with the distictive hat.  Both Kennedys are absolutely beautiful, the closest thing America will ever have to England's royalty.  From Fort Worth, it is on to Dallas and the fateful shots that will change history.  The clips shown are the actual live tv broadcasts along with film footage from 8 mm cameras taken by bystanders.  The editing is flawless, the cuts between clips is amazing in itself, segued seamlessly between cameras that were filming the same event from different angles.  The assassinaation occured at 12:30 PM, and shortly thereafter, the afternoon soap operas were interupted by Harry Reasoner and Walter Cronkite, who then bring the stunning and shocking events as they transpire. It is FASCINATING viewing - absolutely riveting.  It is like watching the horrible events of that weekend in November unfold in real time, only speeded up.  The dramatic impact of what is shown is clearly evident in the news reporters breathless announcements.There is subtle music in the background that is somewhat sinister in nature, but does not detract from the video clips.  It perfectly sets the tone of the assassination.  There is no master narration, only subtitles introducing certain film clips.  The clips are so dramatic, no explanatory narration is needed or required. Each moment is prefaced on-screen with the exact time it occurred.  I am quite familiar with the details of the assassination, and yet, there are clips of film in this dvd (and details) I have never seen before.After the initial four days, November 22-25, 1963, other related developments are shown in chronologic order.  How the Warren Commission came to be and the controversy concerning their findings.  Ruby's trial and death (from cancer) is shown.  The first conspiracy books are introduced in 1966-67.  New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's explosive allegations are then detailed, including Garrison's infamous appearance on the Johnny Carson Show.  The Senate Select Committee on Assassinations is shown via newsclips.  Thereafter, the exhumation of Oswald's body is detailed and why his body was dug up.  Then there are the various anniversaries of the assassination, and the related activities at Dealey Plaza, the ""hallowed grounds of the assassination.  Running at exactly three hours in length, time almost seems to stand still while watching this video, as the viewer is captured from moment one in anticipation of what is to come.Whether there is a conspiracy or whether Oswald shot President Kennedy acting alone is not debated.  Both explanations are presented through news clips, and it is left to the viewer to make his/her conclusion(s).  This objective approach to the assassination is singularly unique; you just cannot find an assassination resource that is this objective.  Perhaps this is why I enjoyed the dvd so very much.  This is history unfolding before your eyes, pure and simple.If you were not alive, or cannot recall the events of 22 November, 1963, this is the dvd that will show you what transpired moment by moment.  Even if you can recall exactly where you were at 12:30 PM that cold November day, this video will bring it all back to mind, and more.This is a dvd you wil likely want to keep in your library.konedog",5,Like Watching a Historical Drama Unfold,1303257600,"04 20, 2011",2011,3778,"['was', 'just', '8', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'President', 'John', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'slain', 'downtown', 'Dallas', 'remember', 'going', 'home', 'school', 'early', 'finding', 'mom', 'riveted', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'Just', 'being', '8', 'years', 'old', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'importance', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'day', 'Now', '3', 'hour', 'dvd', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'mom', 'dad', 'watched', 'fateful', 'weekend.The', 'assassination', 'events', 'literally', 'unfold', 'step', 'step', 'starting', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'breakfast', 'Fort', 'Worth', 'where', 'see', 'Jackie', 'Kennedy', 'introduced', 'pink', 'wool', 'suit', 'distictive', 'hat', 'Kennedys', 'are', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'closest', 'thing', 'America', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'England', 'royalty', 'Fort', 'Worth', 'Dallas', 'fateful', 'shots', 'will', 'change', 'history', 'clips', 'shown', 'are', 'actual', 'live', 'tv', 'broadcasts', 'film', 'footage', '8', 'mm', 'cameras', 'taken', 'bystanders', 'editing', 'flawless', 'cuts', 'clips', 'amazing', 'segued', 'seamlessly', 'cameras', 'were', 'filming', 'same', 'event', 'different', 'angles', 'assassinaation', 'occured', '12:30', 'PM', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'afternoon', 'soap', 'operas', 'were', 'interupted', 'Harry', 'Reasoner', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'who', 'then', 'bring', 'stunning', 'shocking', 'events', 'transpire', 'FASCINATING', 'viewing', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'watching', 'horrible', 'events', 'weekend', 'November', 'unfold', 'real', 'time', 'only', 'speeded', 'up', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'what', 'shown', 'clearly', 'evident', 'news', 'reporters', 'breathless', 'announcements.There', 'subtle', 'music', 'background', 'somewhat', 'sinister', 'nature', 'not', 'detract', 'video', 'clips', 'perfectly', 'tone', 'assassination', 'master', 'narration', 'only', 'introducing', 'certain', 'film', 'clips', 'clips', 'are', 'so', 'dramatic', 'explanatory', 'narration', 'needed', 'required', 'moment', 'prefaced', 'on-screen', 'exact', 'time', 'occurred', 'am', 'quite', 'familiar', 'details', 'assassination', 'yet', 'are', 'clips', 'film', 'dvd', 'details', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'before.After', 'initial', 'four', 'days', 'November', '22-25', '1963', 'other', 'related', 'developments', 'are', 'shown', 'chronologic', 'order', 'How', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'came', 'be', 'controversy', 'concerning', 'findings', 'Ruby', 'trial', 'death', 'cancer', 'shown', 'first', 'conspiracy', 'books', 'are', 'introduced', '1966-67', 'New', 'Orleans', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'explosive', 'allegations', 'are', 'then', 'detailed', 'including', 'Garrison', 'infamous', 'appearance', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'Show', 'Senate', 'Select', 'Committee', 'Assassinations', 'shown', 'newsclips', 'Thereafter', 'exhumation', 'Oswald', 'body', 'detailed', 'why', 'body', 'was', 'dug', 'up', 'Then', 'are', 'various', 'anniversaries', 'assassination', 'related', 'activities', 'Dealey', 'Plaza', 'hallowed', 'grounds', 'assassination', 'Running', 'exactly', 'three', 'hours', 'length', 'time', 'almost', 'stand', 'still', 'watching', 'video', 'viewer', 'captured', 'moment', 'one', 'anticipation', 'what', 'come.Whether', 'conspiracy', 'Oswald', 'shot', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'acting', 'alone', 'not', 'debated', 'explanations', 'are', 'presented', 'news', 'clips', 'left', 'viewer', 'make', 'his/her', 'conclusion', 's', 'objective', 'approach', 'assassination', 'singularly', 'unique', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'assassination', 'resource', 'objective', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'dvd', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'history', 'unfolding', 'eyes', 'pure', 'simple.If', 'were', 'not', 'alive', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'events', '22', 'November', '1963', 'dvd', 'will', 'show', 'what', 'transpired', 'moment', 'moment', 'Even', 'can', 'recall', 'exactly', 'where', 'were', '12:30', 'PM', 'cold', 'November', 'day', 'video', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'mind', 'more.This', 'dvd', 'wil', 'likely', 'want', 'keep', 'library.konedog']",N/A

It has two parts, The first part is the best and it's an hour by hour timeline of the events commencing on the morning of Nov. 22, and finishes on  Nov 24 with the national funeral and Oswald's murder. It starts with what the president would have exactly seen that day - a car enters Dealy Plaza filming the road ahead while dreamlike music plays. The stark slow motion B/W footage makes it even more dreamy. We see Jackie make a grand entrance at the breakfast of chamber of commerce the morning of November 22nd, knowing it will be her last as first lady, wearing her now famous pink suit and hat. After the president makes his speech,  we watch  him leave for the airport that will take him to Love Field while the speaker prays for his blessing and the decisions he is faced with. Very eerie and disturbing knowing what will happen in a scant hour and a bit. In fact I find the whole breakfast disturbing, particularly The Texas Schoolboys choir singing 'The eyes of texas are upon you'. JFK watches them and the camera stays on him until the words ""The eyes of Texas are upon you all the live long day, The eyes of texas are upon you You cannot get away"". And, he didnt get out alive.Just prior to arrival of the president we see footage of the presidential limo on the tarmac. Pretty eerie again I must say.  We see a cheerful woman on the tarmac with a sketch (I assume she did herself) of the president and first lady. Then Airforce One touches down at Love Field  to a rousing reception. I watch this hoping that something will happen differently - The Limo will leave Love Field with  the bubble top attatched, the motorcade will take a different route, the SS agents will hurl themselves on the back on the limo and shield him or take the bullets, or the car will go down Elm St. and nothing will happen. Sometimes I  watch the breakfast and leave it there as I see a young vibrant man (well we know now  he wasn't vibrant he was in fact very sick) happy and in his prime. I'll leave him alive and then the awful truth wont happen. It's all pointless fo course because it's just a moving image of something that happened nearly a half century ago. We see the confused early reports as the presenters are totally unprepared for such a cataclysmic event. The technology isn't quite prepared  for the events that accelerate incredibly fast and nearly  spin out of control. It somehow manages to keep up albeit a few hiccups. Live via satellite beaming was in it's early stages, and this was the event that challenged it's limitations and really ushered in the technological age of modern news reporting. It was forced upon us with this news story.You get a sense that America is sort of knocked unconscious for a time with a massive blow from out of nowhere. You can understand why the powers that be tried to quell the mood and bring stablisiation by assuring them that there was just a lone guman acting alone. I never understood why until I watched this. A news presenter on CBS says "" I sincerely hope that the assassin, whoever he is,  is not connected with any particular political group, hate group, as this could result in the very great rending of  the political flesh on this country"".  Conspiracy was already being talked about. America needed a slap in the face as it was getting hysterical. America needed to hear some reassurance that all would be ok that is was a random act by an individual, not some dark force that would envelope them  - J Edgar  Hoover supplied them with just that.  We hear audio of  the conductor of The Boston Symphony Orchestra inform the audience of the tragedy to  their disbelief. They then  play Beethoven's funeral march to images of the dead president's casket being carried up the stairs to Airforce One. Only hours before, he was head of the country waving in the sunshine to thousands of Dallas citizens. Now his body had been hijacked at gunpoint by the Secret Service - his protectors.I never realized how the Dallas Police were warned about the huge potential risk Oswald's safety. They KNEW there was a big danger of him being harmed.  The people of Dallas were frothing and in a frenzy and wanted revenge. They knew and yet were woefully unable to protect him. Chief Jesse Curry comes across to me as part coldly aloof and part bumbling fool. I'm sure The Simpsons took some of his character to create Chief Clancy Wiggum. He calmly announces that Oswald `expired' at 1.07pm. When asked beforehand by the reporters whether Oswald is any danger he says "" I don't think the people will try and take the prisoner away from us"". DUH Hello chief? Anybody home? They're practically begging you to take special care of Oswald as there's an angry mob wanting to lynch him. And this is the police chief in charge of the safety of the accused assassin of the President Of The United States Of America? Unbelievable!Part two is  pretty much conspiracy theories and the assassinations later in the decade. It starts with the aftermath of Oswald's murder and sort of documents the decay of the great American dream as the decade unfolds.The title to this is absolutely perfect because this DID really change America. This assassination with all it's ugliness changed the way we look at our governments. When we started learning - via this case and it's declassified files - the unsavoury covert activities of the CIA FBI, we started to question the people who were our protectors, leaders. We learned that our government operated in the shadows. Mid-decade we see Garrison, Mark Lane openly and rightfully question the findings of The Warren Commission - The honourable men assigned to investigate the murder of their president. Amercian citizens, indeed everyone in the world, awoke from our naive stupor to slowly see how corrupt our authority figures really were. And that includes JFK. Suddenly these werent perfect beings running things perfectly anymore. Look at the near hysterical welcome Kennedy gets on his arrival at Love Field, Dallas on this DVD compared to Nixon's arrival (also on the DVD) at the same airport just 7 years later. There was barely anyone there. The world in 1970 had changed 30 years since 1963. The wide eyed optimism of the people showed talking about the movie star-like president on November 22, 1963, had now been replaced by resentful cynicism.It's a great DVD and a must for any history buff and JFK buff. The sad indictment for America, indeed the world, is  JFK's legacy is not about any of his political decisions, it's about deciding which direction his brain matter flew.",5,Compulsive
