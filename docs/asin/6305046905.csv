A shy sensitive widowed clock maker, Wayland Jackson, played by Kurt Russell on his way through the mountains with his only daughter becomes stuck in a creek and ends up sticking around for longer than he bargained.  There he meets the elusive Collie Wright (Kelly McGillis's character) who with her only son seems to be living alone off from the small town.  Immediately you sense a spark between the two but as the story progresses you realize there is a dark looming secret which threatens both lives.  It appears Ellie's family has an ancient hatred that runs deep for their neighbors and would shootem' just as look at'em.  Enter dark loomy character which is the babe's father and he's from the other side of the mountain.  He is the exact opposite of our shy clock maker and Ellie knows this.  Perhaps when some see the performances as cheesy or over acted they've never actually met any mountain folk, and thusly are insistent that the histrionics are over played.  If you have been to the mountains and can feel the spirit of them then I think you will love this picture.

I doubt if many renters would have  the patience to stick with this movie all the way through, but if they do,  they will be rewarded. Everything at the beginning seems wrong: The  characters' actions seem inexplicable (i.e. Kurt Russell stopping his truck  in the middle of a creek); Russell acts and sounds like he flunked out of  the Famous Announcers' School; Kelly McGillis acts and sounds like sixth  runner-up in the Elly May Clampett impression contest; all the other actors  also seem off-kilter, especially Don Michael Paul, giving one of the  weirdest and most histrionic performances in cinematic history as McGillis'  kid brother. But then, about halfway through, the father of McGillis' baby  returns for a duel to the death with Russell. The fight itself is quite  exciting, but even more, the movie actually gets good afterward. The  dialogue suddenly takes on weight and believability, as do all the  performances (except for Mr. Paul's); McGillis is particularly moving in  her big emotional scenes. This is a great movie for connoisseurs of  cinematic schizophrenia, or merely for viewers who have the patience to  wait for the good stuff to come along!",3,"A real oddity--starts terrible, gets good.",965088000,"08 1, 2000",2000,1288,"['Winter', 'People', 'really', ""n't"", 'three-star', 'movie', 'movie', 'one-star', 'first', 'half', 'five-star', 'second', 'half', 'doubt', 'many', 'renters', 'would', 'have', 'patience', 'stick', 'movie', 'way', 'do', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'Everything', 'beginning', 'wrong', 'characters', 'actions', 'seem', 'inexplicable', 'i.e', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'stopping', 'truck', 'middle', 'creek', 'Russell', 'acts', 'sounds', 'flunked', 'Famous', 'Announcers', 'School', 'Kelly', 'McGillis', 'acts', 'sounds', 'sixth', 'runner-up', 'Elly', 'May', 'Clampett', 'impression', 'contest', 'other', 'actors', 'also', 'seem', 'off-kilter', 'especially', 'Don', 'Michael', 'Paul', 'giving', 'one', 'weirdest', 'most', 'histrionic', 'performances', 'cinematic', 'history', 'McGillis', 'kid', 'brother', 'then', 'halfway', 'father', 'McGillis', 'baby', 'returns', 'duel', 'death', 'Russell', 'fight', 'quite', 'exciting', 'even', 'more', 'movie', 'actually', 'good', 'afterward', 'dialogue', 'suddenly', 'weight', 'believability', 'do', 'performances', 'Mr.', 'Paul', 'McGillis', 'particularly', 'moving', 'big', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'great', 'movie', 'connoisseurs', 'cinematic', 'schizophrenia', 'merely', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'patience', 'wait', 'good', 'stuff', 'come', 'along']",Winter People VHS
