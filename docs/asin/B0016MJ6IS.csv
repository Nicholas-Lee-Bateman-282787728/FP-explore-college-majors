1154049,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B0016MJ6IS,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[0, 0]","At first I thought Superhero Movie was going to suck, mostly because I had seen the first two Scary Movies (Scary Movie 1 was decent, 2 was awful!) and after hearing the horrendous reception of other parody films. But I was pleasantly surprised by the results. Sure it's a dumb film, it delivers cheap laughs, but it also gives some good hard laughs. While people are mixed on this one, I will guarantee you that this parody will not ruin your day and make you wish for death like a Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer parody film (Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, and Disaster Movie).WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The film is basically a parody of the first Spiderman film with a few other parodies of Batman Begins, X-Men, and Fantastic 4 (UGH). Rick Riker is a teenage nerd at Empire City High School whom no one really likes and during a class trip to a lab, he gets bitten by a genetically engineered dragonfly and then he becomes the dragonfly. Then he encounters a villain called 'The Hourglass' who uses his hand to drain the life out of his victims in order to sustain his own life. Now he must stop 'The Hourglass' from taking thousands of lives and protect his love Jill.MUSIC: The music fits the superhero theme and is well-done as a whole. It does give the film a comic book feel. It's a bit cheesy and corny, but that's how it's supposed to be.HUMOR: This film is loaded with cheap laughs and some good hard laughs. I had gripes with certain parts of the film, and felt as if they overkilled some of the humor. However this film as a whole kept me laughing and chuckling at it's stupid, yet funny humor.ACTION: Like most superhero films, this one has the Dragonfly fighting crime and yet focuses on his relationship with Jill, while dealing with family problems. This film never really gets boring and there are some good action-oriented scenes. Some parts of the film were really dumb, which does damage the quality as a whole. Overall, it's entertaining throughout.ACTING: Although I've always hated the show Drake and Josh, Drake Bell does a good job at being a stupid teenager. I liked the cast a whole and there wasn't anyone whose acting was poor because they were meant to be dumb. Leslie Nielsen did a good job playing Rick Riker's uncle and he was funny. Overall the acting was solid even if sometimes they were overly stupid.OVERALL: Although I thought it was solid, I would recommend it as a rental. It has good laughs to offer and it won't make you hate yourself like Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, or Disaster Movie. It's a solid parody film that does manage to get the basics right and keep you entertained throughout.THE GOOD: The acting was silly and dumb like it's supposed to be, the humor was rather funny, the story does a good job at parodying other super hero films, and the music was cheesy and dumb in a good way.THE BAD: Some jokes are overkilled and some really dumb moments of acting.",4,"STUPID AND DUMB, BUT SOLID AS A WHOLE  8 OUT OF 10",1242518400,"05 17, 2009",2009,2932,"['first', 'thought', 'Superhero', 'Movie', 'was', 'going', 'suck', 'mostly', 'had', 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'Scary', 'Movies', 'Scary', 'Movie', '1', 'was', 'decent', '2', 'was', 'awful', 'hearing', 'horrendous', 'reception', 'other', 'parody', 'films', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'results', 'Sure', 'dumb', 'film', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'also', 'good', 'hard', 'laughs', 'people', 'are', 'mixed', 'one', 'will', 'guarantee', 'parody', 'will', 'not', 'ruin', 'day', 'make', 'wish', 'death', 'Jason', 'Friedberg', 'Aaron', 'Seltzer', 'parody', 'film', 'Date', 'Movie', 'Epic', 'Movie', 'Meet', 'Spartans', 'Disaster', 'Movie', '.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'film', 'basically', 'parody', 'first', 'Spiderman', 'film', 'few', 'other', 'parodies', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'X-Men', 'Fantastic', '4', 'UGH', 'Rick', 'Riker', 'teenage', 'nerd', 'Empire', 'City', 'High', 'School', 'whom', 'one', 'really', 'class', 'trip', 'lab', 'bitten', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'dragonfly', 'then', 'dragonfly', 'Then', 'villain', 'called', ""'The"", 'Hourglass', 'who', 'hand', 'drain', 'life', 'victims', 'order', 'sustain', 'own', 'life', 'Now', 'must', 'stop', ""'The"", 'Hourglass', 'taking', 'thousands', 'lives', 'protect', 'love', 'Jill.MUSIC', 'music', 'superhero', 'theme', 'well-done', 'whole', 'give', 'film', 'comic', 'book', 'feel', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'corny', 'how', 'supposed', 'be.HUMOR', 'film', 'loaded', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'good', 'hard', 'laughs', 'had', 'gripes', 'certain', 'parts', 'film', 'felt', 'overkilled', 'humor', 'However', 'film', 'whole', 'kept', 'laughing', 'chuckling', 'stupid', 'yet', 'funny', 'humor.ACTION', 'most', 'superhero', 'films', 'one', 'Dragonfly', 'fighting', 'crime', 'yet', 'focuses', 'relationship', 'Jill', 'dealing', 'family', 'problems', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'boring', 'are', 'good', 'action-oriented', 'scenes', 'parts', 'film', 'were', 'really', 'dumb', 'damage', 'quality', 'whole', 'Overall', 'entertaining', 'throughout.ACTING', ""'ve"", 'always', 'hated', 'show', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'Drake', 'Bell', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'stupid', 'teenager', 'liked', 'cast', 'whole', 'was', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'acting', 'was', 'poor', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'dumb', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'Rick', 'Riker', 'uncle', 'was', 'funny', 'acting', 'was', 'solid', 'even', 'sometimes', 'were', 'overly', 'stupid.OVERALL', 'thought', 'was', 'solid', 'would', 'recommend', 'rental', 'good', 'laughs', 'offer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'hate', 'Date', 'Movie', 'Epic', 'Movie', 'Meet', 'Spartans', 'Disaster', 'Movie', 'solid', 'parody', 'film', 'manage', 'get', 'basics', 'right', 'keep', 'entertained', 'throughout.THE', 'GOOD', 'acting', 'was', 'silly', 'supposed', 'be', 'humor', 'was', 'rather', 'funny', 'story', 'good', 'job', 'parodying', 'other', 'super', 'hero', 'films', 'music', 'was', 'cheesy', 'dumb', 'good', 'way.THE', 'BAD', 'jokes', 'are', 'overkilled', 'really', 'dumb', 'moments', 'acting']",N/A

1154055,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B0016MJ6IS,Bill Garrison,"[15, 17]","SUPERHERO MOVIE bombed at the box office, but as a lifelong fan of the genre and movies like AIRPLANE, TOP SECRET, and NAKED GUN, I felt almost compelled to watch it. I doubt there will ever be another breakthrough spoof movie due to the fact that now there are so many of them. During the eighties and nineties, spoof movies came out every other year or so, now they come out every other month (Scary, Date, Epic, Disaster, etc). SUPERHERO MOVIE is not a great movie within the spoof genre, but it provides many good laughs and returns to the roots of what made the movies like Airplane and Naked Gun so great.The DVD has a feature called ""Anatomy of a Spoof"" that among other things, gives director Craig Mazin's (a Zucker prot&eacute;g&eacute; and fan) philosophy of spoof movies. First, the actors need to play it straight, and second, the movie needs to have characters you care about and create an actual story within the genre you are trying to spoof. It this movie, all the actors play it straight. Drake Bell is Rick Ryker, the Peter Parker clone who gets bit by a Dragonfly and gets superpowers. Sara Paxton plays the love interest. Christopher McDonald is the evil Hourglass. Leslie Neilsen is the wise uncle. The plot follows the basic structure of Spiderman, and throws in Fantastic Four and X-men spoofs as well. The movie avoids trying to create comedy by recreating scenes from famous super hero movies. Director and writer Mazin really tries to make a story the viewers will care about, and many of the jokes are found in the dialogue.Mazin knew what he was doing. He crafted an entertaining spoof full of witty dialogue. A few things brought the movie down. First, the glut of spoof movies took away any chance for this film to be original. Second, it seemed a limited budget took away from some of the special effects that could have been utilized. Third, Mazin just isn't as talented as the Zucker brothers. Still, this movie had some good stuff, including my favorite, Steven Hawking. This is a must see for fans of the genre. It's not perfect, but SUPERHERO MOVIE is definitely trying to follow in the footsteps of AIRPLANE, and that's more than can be said for all the Date and Epic movie spoofs.",4,"A solid entry into the spoof genre.

With these plot elements in place one might believe that the trap is set for a good spoof.  But as quickly as the film sets us up for a refreshing superhero sendup, it lets us down with a birrage of fart jokes, myspace references, and poorly used cameos.On the brightside, Superhero Movie was able to pull a few surprise laughs out of me due to my fascination with making fun of Steven Hawking.  Unfortuneatly, the same one-two punch formula of cheap laughs apply here in which the audience will be left laughing at the shear stupidity of the studios for funding the same movie in a different box over and over again, rather than the writing.

I wanted to give it 4 stars because compared to Meet the Spartans, Date Movie and Epic Movie, SUPERHERO MOVIE is comedy GENIUS. A shining beacon in the spoof movie doodoo fest we've been enduring recently.Yet, in its mere 85 minutes, it seemed to come and go. There were moments of hilarity and there were moments where it slowed down to crawl. Although, there were dozens of things that SUPERHERO MOVIE did that made it rein supreme over some of the retarded comedies hollywood has been spewing out lately.First of all, there was a story to follow. YEAH! Hard to believe that is something that I had to say, but it's true. The story may have been lame and one dimensional, but at least there was one. Secondly, it had set up to its jokes.

1154061,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0016MJ6IS,Chris Pandolfi,"[8, 10]","Is there any good way to start a review for yet another mindless spoof? With the release of ""Meet the Spartans"" back in January, it did seem as if the parody genre was on the rise again. Since we now have ""Superhero Movie"" added to the mix, I'm really not sure anymore; it isn't as funny as ""Meet the Spartans,"" but it's certainly a lot better than the droning jokiness of films like ""Scary Movie 3,"" ""Scary Movie 4,"" ""Date Movie,"" and ""Epic Movie."" Most of these films were nothing more than comedic vignettes, having no real plot other than a back-to-back series of gags. This new film actually does make an attempt at a plot ... and by ""plot,"" I mean that it takes all the best elements from the first ""Spider-Man"" and forces them to be goofy, at times too much so. ""Superhero Movie"" is by no means a comedic masterpiece--the sense of humor is juvenile, the jokes are blatantly obvious, and the dialogue is just plain dopey.But since ""Meet the Spartans"" was all that and more, how can I be kinder to it than to ""Superhero Movie""? Partly, it's because the former parodies ""300,"" a movie with violence so excessive and action so stylized that it was practically begging to be made fun of. But it mainly has to do with the fact that ""Meet the Spartans"" was unashamedly aware of itself, letting the audience know that it was, in fact, watching a spoof of a great film. I found that level of self-awareness funny. ""Superhero Movie"" is certainly aware of itself, but not at a satisfying level; the opening credits show close-ups of the hero's suit while a light passes over it; we eventually see that the light emanates from a flashlight the hero is holding. Could nothing more come from this gag than a flashlight? Could no one think of something even funnier than that?""Superhero Movie"" tells the story of a high school kid named Rick Riker (Drake Bell), a story he claims ""is not for the faint of heart."" While on a field trip to the local laboratory, Riker is bitten by a genetically altered dragonfly; he soon realizes that he's developing super powers, not the least of which is his ability to break-dance vertically on the wall of a building. He also has lightening fast reflexes, as seen when he catches a nail fired from a nail gun. Disguised in a green and black suit and going by the name Dragonfly, Riker uses his abilities to fight crime all over the city, which doesn't seem to be a problem for his aunt and uncle (Marion Ross and Leslie Nielsen). By the way, he lives with them because, nine years ago, his parents were horribly murdered after leaving a movie theater.His archenemy is Lou Landers, a.k.a. Hourglass (Christopher McDonald), a terminally ill scientist who, through a technological accident, has the ability to suck the life energy out of people. If he can find a specific number of victims, he will be able to live forever, despite his illness. Riker is supposed to save the day, but he lacks confidence since he's a dragonfly that can't actually fly. Whatever. Maybe the girl he's secretly in love with--Jill Johnson (Sara Paxton)--can inspire him towards greatness. At the very least, she can inspire him to attempt a naughty version of the upside down kiss from ""Spider-Man.""If this doesn't seem all that funny, that's probably because the plots for parody films are anything but; it's all about the jokes and how many can be crammed into a single film. Indeed, ""Superhero Movie"" practically bursts at the seams with the mass of its humor. Does all of it work? No, but there are a few select moments I laughed at: there's a moment when Leslie Nielsen's character reads to Riker from a puberty book, only to realize it covers changes in the female body; Riker recalls what his uncle says later in the film, when it seems least appropriate. There are some moments when a parody of Professor Stephen Hawking (Robert Joy) cusses in his distinct computer-generated voice. Some may find this offensive, but keep in mind that the real Stephen Hawking once provided his voice to an episode of ""The Simpsons.""But for every funny moment, there are two or three that aren't all that funny. Example: Riker accidentally sprays himself with animal pheromones and attracts everything from dogs to rabbits to skunks (and you don't want to know what happens when a snail shows up). There's a cameo appearance from Pamela Anderson as Invisible Girl; she's been having an affair with the handicapped and bald Professor Xavier (Tracy Morgan), and that puts him at odds with his equally handicapped and bald wife (Regina Hall). There's also a moment when Riker's aunt is asleep on the couch, and she does nothing but pass gas in front of Riker and Jill as they try to share a tender moment with one another. You may not believe this, but that does get old after a while.While this movie is nowhere near as bad as it could have been, it still isn't good enough to recommend, so those of you upset by my positive review of ""Meet the Spartans"" can rest easy. ""Superhero Movie"" is amusing but hardly hilarious, which--believe it or not--is more than I can say for many of our more recent parody films. I'm sure teenagers will love this film, which I guess is fine since there certainly are worse movies. Some people will get a kick out of Brent ""Data"" Spiner, who plays a scientist that screams like a woman at a certain point. Yes, ""Superhero Movie"" is juvenile, but it's also harmless, so in the end, it's really no better and no worse than you expect it to be.",3,From Hero to Zero,1206662400,"03 28,

1154063,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0016MJ6IS,DanD,"[1, 1]","This isn't ""Date Movie"" or ""Epic Movie"" or ""Meet the Spartans.""  Let's get that clear up front.  Of course, in all honesty, this isn't ""Airplane"" or ""Naked Gun"" either.  But it's much better than the former set of movies, and that's what counts.I won't re-hash the plot--you've seen it in your favorite superhero movies anyways.  Drake Bell, as Rick Riker (turned Dragonfly), shows promise; he's not quite to the Leslie Nielsen level, but then no one really is, so we'll forgive him for that.  As for Nielsen...he's given a few clunker lines, but it's Leslie Nielsen; even the worst line ever written is enjoyable coming from him.  His presence alone helps elevate this movie somewhat.As does the rest of the cast.  There is a surprisingly large amount of talent in this film.  Christopher McDonald, as the villain Hourglass, is always a welcome presence in this type of movie.  Kevin Hart, as Riker's friend, is also a nice addition.  Brent Spiner milks the most from his small performance; and Keith David, only in a couple small scenes, delivers one of the funniest lines of the movie: ""What Empire City needs is more police officers--and a Hooter's.""  Other cameos (Robert Hays, Simon Rex, and yes, even Pam Anderson) help flesh out the film, adding some extra humor that might otherwise be lacking.However, the excellent cast is also a bit of a let-down, considering the movie isn't all THAT great.  There are a few great scenes (the beginning scene in the lab, with the pheromones especially) and some great one-liners...but they just aren't up to par.  It's hard to take a spoof seriously these days; we can thank a long line of horrible or near-horrible parodies for that.  The parody has become a money-maker, and not the art form it once was.  ""Superhero Movie,"" despite its high points, displays that prominantly.Still...it's good for a few chuckles, even a couple hearty laughs.  I wish they'd have given it a different name, to seperate it from its predecessors (as well as give it a different cover that didn't blatantly rip-off the ""Scary Movie"" franchise).  But the movie itself is decent.  I suppose that's the best we can expect these days, in the parody world (""Scary Movie 3"" being the only exception I can think of).  We can still hope, though, that one day someone will come along who will truly appreciate the art of the parody.  Mel Brooks is still making movies, isn't he?

This week, I will watch the various comedy films that typically feature on the front of the DVD ""from the guys who brought you SCARY MOVIE and the NAKED GUN"".I pretty much know what I'm getting into with these films and know you have to have an open mind because although many scenes will have its funny moments, you can expect your share of really idiotic moments as well.I know people who can just laugh and know what to expect with these films but some who have never seen these type of films and just feel the wasted their time watching it.  So, with that being said, enjoyment of this film depends on your take of these type of movies.""SUPERHERO MOVIE"" is a film that parodies the first ""Spider-Man"" film, ""Fantastic Four"", ""X-Men"" and ""Batman"".The film revolves around Rick Riker, a nerdy high school teenager who loves his classmate but bullied quite a bit in his school.  Things go from bad at worse at a school trip when he accidentally spills a chemical which attracts animals to him and somehow he ends up being bit by a radioactive dragonfly.Riker develops special powers and next thing you know, the Dragonfly is born.Marion Ross and Leslie Nielsen play the aunt and uncle of Rick Riker.  In true Leslie Nielsen fashion, if you watched the ""Naked Gun"" films, you know what to expect for his role.  Marion Ross of ""Happy Days"" fame was quite interesting as the aunt who has a major flatulence problem and just can't stop farting.Tracy Morgan plays a Professor X type of role, trying to help Riker learn his new powers and show him the school of teens who have powers.  Pamela Anderson plays the role of Invisible Woman who has been caught messing around with Professor X by Mrs. Professor X.One of the highlight scenes is when Riker and the girl of his dreams, Jill Johnson are about to share a kiss but his aunt Lucille (Marion Ross) sleeping right next to them leashes continuous farts that just sound so horrible.  Fart jokes can be funny and the manage to include a hilarious gassy scenes in which Jill who really wants to kiss Riker, uses her tampons to put up her nose to avoid smelling the fart. Fart jokes are gross but when done well, you can't hep but laugh.Of course, probably the coldest jokes are the ones on physicist Stephen Hawking.  The gags on his character featured getting his head accidentally stuck in a beehive and not able to get out of it because of his disability.  And of course, using his vocoder device to simulate Hawking screaming profanities. For a film to really make fun of his disability to get some cheap laughs is just very cold.There are so many gags in this film with those type of gags, some quite funny and some that are just idiotic but I found this film more to the funny side fortunately.  But with jokes such as the Stephen Hawking (which there are numerous scenes with this character), I can see many finding it tasteless and some to find it so funny knowing it's so wrong.AUDIO & VIDEO:Truthfully, I wasn't paying too much attention towards the quality of the film and as for the audio, the film is strictly dialogue.  Not much need for special audio effects.SPECIAL FEATURES:The extended version features the alternate ending, deleted scenes, two featurettes and a theatrical trailer plus a commentary.  The regular version only features the alternate ending (which was so dumb, I'm glad they didn't use it), deleted scenes and the theatrical trailer.There are three versions of this film on DVD in the US.  The regular version which is only 74 minutes long and has only the alternate ending, deleted scenes and theatrical trailer, while the extended version which is 82 minutes long and has the additional commentary track and featurettes.  The third version is a Blockbuster exclusive which features additional deleted scenes.So, far of the movies within this genre and created by the same creators of ""SCARY MOVIE"" and ""NAKED GUN"", of the more recent films, ""SUPERHERO MOVIE"" was probably the funniest compared to the others. Again, this is comparing to the other related films by the same creators.There is a lot of funny jokes throughout the film but there are also a good number of idiotic jokes as well.I enjoyed the superhero film parodies on this film and although there are a few well-known talent who made cameos on this film, I'm just glad many of their segments were quite short.  In fact, I'm glad that the film was quite short.In the end, I definitely didn't find myself disliking it.  I suppose it's because I enjoyed the superhero parodies on the film and I haven't seen a film go so far to do a parody based on superhero films in this magnitude.All in all, a fun film if you come

With the releases (and successes) of IRON MAN, THE INCEDIBLE HULK and DARK KNICHT, superhero movies have taken hold. What began with X-MEN and SPIDERMAN is now a film genre that looks like it has holding power. So what better time than now to do a spoof?SUPERHERO MOVIE takes on that challenge and does a fantastic job. Thankfully the group behind EPIC MOVIE and MEET THE SPARTANS had nothing to do with this. Those movies were great example of how not to make a spoof. This one is just the opposite. And why not? David Zucker of AIRPLANE and THE NAKED GUN was a producer here and director Craig Mazen helped write the last two SCARY MOVIE films as well as direct a previous superhero comedy THE SPECIALS.So what's this one about? Young Rick Riker (Drake Bell) is your typical high school nerd. On a field trip to a special lab, he's bitten by an enhanced dragonfly. The next day, he gains powers from the bite like being able to cling to walls, fast reflexes and invulnerability. Okay you get the picture, its Spiderman all over.This includes his from the sidelines adoration of girl next door Jill Johnson (Sara Paxton), evil millionaire turned super villain Lou Landers (Christopher McDonald) and elderly Aunt and Uncle Lucille and Albert Adams (Marion Ross and Leslie Nielsen). With all of these characters put in play, the fun begins.How Rick deals with his new powers is less a question than how his friends and family deal with it. Sure the jokes about his hands being stuck to things now with their insect like gripping ability (everything from a drinking fountain to the bust of his teacher) pop up periodically but at least its not an overused joke that never stops. Instead jokes about his powers and family ties twist and turn in various directions.Along the way Rick meets Prof. Xavier (Tracy Morgan) whose Home For Gifted Students (Non-Asian) is a locale for heroes to learn and train. Try and forget the site of Wolverine using his admantium claws to shave his legs. But their good intentions aren't Rick's way so he heads home to learn to be a hero on his own.Meanwhile, Lou Landers is dying with a short time left to live. What better time than now to try out the machine he was working on to find cures for all ills and prolong life. The only drawback is that to do so, he must drain the life from someone else daily. The only way to increase this to immortality is to suck the life force from over 47,000 people and that requires a rare element that he steals in the guise of Hourglass, super villain!Will Rick adapt in time to save the day? Will Hourglass drain everyone on screen? And will Leslie Nielsen ever stop making these kinds of movies? Let's hope not!The jokes are more sight oriented than spoken so it's difficult to offer an example here without blowing the joke. And from past experience with AIRPLANE, to ruin a visual joke from one of these is a sin. Instead, take the time to rent this one and give it a watch. You'll find yourself laughing from start to finish.And with this movie coming out prior to the latest summer trend, one can only imagine that a sequel would be in the works. This one jumped the gun, coming out prior to the summer blast. But it fits right in with all of the films hitting screens now.After writing this initial review, I went back and watched this movie once more. And I can honestly say that it was as funny the second time around as it was the first. It was then that I noticed why and where it did so many things right compared to the recent spoofs mentioned at the beginning of this piece.First off, while the time period of this movie takes place in the present, it doesn't rely non-stop on current trends (other than superhero movies) or celebrities. One of the worst parts of MEET THE SPARTANS was the repetitious use of the trifecta of slutty celebs (Britney, Lindsay and Paris) to the point where the movie as much about them as it was the movie being spoofed.Secondly, I noticed the trademark comedy moments that had been missing for years but were first put into place with the Zucker Brothers and Abrahms first films like AIRPLANE or THE NAKED GUN. These were what seemed to be tossed off lines that were out of place but when you saw or rather heard them again the humor or inappropriateness that led to humor was there.Lastly, the movie seemed to have a genuine love for the subject that it was spoofing. You can tell that these people loved the Spiderman movies. MEET THE SPARTANS and EPIC MOVIE just seemed like people making fun of movies they either didn't get or didn't enjoy. Otherwise why choose to ridicule things that had nothing to do with the subject at hand or insert pop culture references that were always out of place?Yes, in watching this movie again I laughed out loud several times, waited for upcoming joke that were STILL funny the second time I saw them and in general had a good time. And while there were a few ""racy"" moments (that is for pre-teens they might be considered such), the film relied in true comedy rather than those moments. And most of those were comments made by Leslie Neilsen who seems to relish them these days. But...it was all in good fun. And good fun is what you get with this movie.",4,HEROIC SPOOF DOES IT RIGHT,1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,5287,"['summer', '2008', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'summer', 'superhero', 'movie',

1154086,APOUYO1BEPK22,B0016MJ6IS,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[14, 19]","Having `basically' gotten a free copy of this, I decided to go ahead and check it out. I had seriously doubted I would laugh at all in this movie since these movies have been going from good to really bad as quick as a snowball down a snowy hill. I like Scary Movie 1 and 2. But 3 and 4 were bad. Meet the Spartans was bad. I didn't even watch Epic Movie or Date Movie. But Superhero Movie... well... it just might surprise you.The movie basically spoofs Spidey with tidbits of other movies like Batman and X-Men thrown in. Don't let the box art fool you guys. Everyone on the front of the box is in the movie for maybe 5 - 30 seconds with the exception of the Dragonfly. Wolverine's whole part was him shaving his legs with his claws while smoking a cigar... lame. Prof X was in the movie for a few scenes, but it really was just thrown in to get laughs in my opinion. Pam Anderson was in there for maybe a good 30 seconds. Ah well. The movie revolves around Rick Riker (or you could say Peter Parker) who becomes bitten by a radioactive dragonfly. And instead of Green Goblin being his arch-nemesis we have Hourglass played really well by Christopher Donald (I always like that guy for some reason). And, in my opinion, Hourglass is a lot cooler, movie wise at least, than the Green Goblin. Hourglass sucks the life force out of people so he can stay alive. The bodies on screen actually look like all the juices and matter were sucked from their insides until there just a prune of what they once were. So basically if you've seen Spidey then you know what's going on here. Good vs. Evil.The thing about this movie though is they throw in some little twists to the story. Some to make you laugh (or try to) and some just to make the story a little different. The story itself isn't really that bad. If it wasn't for the goofiness and the forced humor, and of course the carbon copy script of Spider Man, then this movie might have been able to stand on its own.Now for the funny parts. I don't see how the writers can go from one extreme to the other like they do and expect laughs. Some scenes seem like they were written for 8 year olds to laugh at while some scenes would have you dive bombing your child with `ear muffs'. In my opinion, I have a pretty good range of humor. I laugh at Kevin Smith stuff, Will Ferrell stuff, and then even stuff that's in Wes Anderson movies such as Royal Tenabaums and Rushmore. I'm everywhere. So saying that, I did laugh more than I expected in this movie. Leslie Nielson had 2 of the best parts in my opinion that involve a nail gun and then a punch. It was back to back and I just didn't expect it and it made me laugh pretty good. But, like most of the recent stuff these writers and directors have done, most of the comedy is too forced and just incredibly dumb. For instance, they have Johnny Storm freak out cause he's on fire. Seriously? He says, ""Watch what I can do"" then says ""FLAME ON!"" Then looks at his body and says, ""OH MY GOD I'M ON FIRE! HELP ME!"" and stops and drops and probably rolls. I'm not sure since I was rolling my eyes. That's the kind of stuff that took this movie from being decent to `eh'.In the end I would say, if there is nothing else to rent, give this a try. Or if you're just a big fan of the Superhero movies, like I am, then just say to heck with it and rent it. It almost feels like a big ""WHAT IF?"" comic. Almost.",2,(2.5) Something to pass the time.

Two days later, I had an opportunity to take my 15 year old niece/Goddaughter to a movie, and I suggested this film. Knowing that this was produced by the same people who did the Airplane and Naked Gun movies, we thought this would be a fun way to spend a Sunday afternoon. How WRONG we were! My niece and I found ourselves uncomfortable from the very start - this was rated PG-13???? No way!! The language, sexual content, bathroom humor, etc. were WAY over the top - and there were some children in the theater! I have never seen these kind of attempts at humor carried to such an extreme as to lose the instinct to laugh and, instead, make you squirm in embarrassment. Oh, I am sure there are many who enjoy this kind of entertainment, and that's fine for them - but then give the film the appropriate RATING! Why was this not rated ""R""???? I would never have taken my niece to an R-rated movie, had I known. To hear some of the things that came out of the mouths of Leslie Nielson and Marion Ross was shocking. If you are a parent who is concerned about the things your children are exposed to, I highly recommend skipping the viewing of this film as a family outing.

However, I think they could have seriously come up with something a lot better then they have done for this movie.There is a few laughs here and there, and a lot of jokes that fall flat. And there is a few very memorable gags where just as you are thinking, ""i've seen this gag before"" they go and do something else to it and make it funny.However, the overall movie and plot is very stale. At times it seem's like it IS trying to be a new Super Hero movie instead of poking fun at them.The jokes towards Fantastic Four I did not find funny at all, they could  have come up with things funny for that, but these jokes fail. Pamala Anderson should hang her head in shame for her 3 minutes on screen time as an invisible woman who add's nothing to the humor of anything.

Even though many of these spoof films lately have been really bad, they may have had a few scenes that were way funnier than anything in this film. I found this film very watch-able, but there are some really stupid gags in this film too.One joke in particular seemed really dumb involving Dragon Fly and The Human Torch on top of a building with both super heroes wanting to perch on a gargoyle statue. First off I have read many comic books in my life and I don't remember Johnny Storm ever perching anywhere! I only mention this  because the joke involving him is really lame, so putting him in this situation for a laugh doesn't even work. I would have thought Daredevil would have been a better choice and the character's blindness would have been easy to get a quick laugh from.About 98 percent of this film is a spoof on the Spider-Man films. There are a few (very few) gags involving other super heroes including X-Men, Fantastic Four and Batman, which is a shame because there are so many films in this genre to make fun of and it might have helped this film be funnier.

If you saw a funny one with a mustache painted over the Mona Lisa and you photocopied that picture and sent it to someone, that's the Superhero Movie in a nutshell.Not only has the **insert movie genre** MOVIE become a genre by itself, it also has to compete with smarter broadcast TV spoof comedies (Family Guy, Simpsons).  At this point, certain devices have established themselves as de rigueur in the spoof vocabulary (prolonged flatulence from polite girls, school group segregation (ie. ""these are the goths, these are the jocks...""), and general boy-meets-girl awkwardness).David Zucker is the producer of this movie, and for those who aren't familiar with the name, Zucker, along with Jim Abrahams invented the spoof movie genre with Kentucky Fried Movie, Police Squad, Airplane, and Naked Gun.  Leslie Nielsen, Zucker's featured actor, is in Superhero Movie too, though he is spoofing Leslie Nielsen roles himself, doing all the things one has come to expect a senile Lt. Frank Drebin to do.The point is, this movie might appear to be spoofing Spiderman, X-men, and Batman on the surface, but as a nonsequel sequel, it is really following a strict formula according to spoof movie rules.  Superhero Movie is really a sequel to the parody movie genre. And once you become aware of that precedent, it's almost a tired exercise in the same worn out routines.Stars who are featured on the cover appear for all but 30 seconds.  Spoof movies were known for cameos, but they never displayed it so audaciously as a marketing tool.  Part of the fun of watching earlier spoof movies would be that sudden, unannounced appearance of a big star (Who could forget the absolute greatest spoof scene in Airplane: Barbara Billingsley, known as America's 50s white suburban mom June Cleaver, speaking hardcore street jive to two black afroed guys?).  I felt that much of the talent was wasted in the Superhero Movie.  Given a better script, they could have made it much funnier.The story is presented in an episodic manner, with one contrived scene after another.  Which is fine, depending on who you are.  Comedy is very subjective.  When I watched it with teenage relatives, they were entertained and giggled with ""OMG! Like, it's totally so retarded!""  Then I watched it with guys in their 40s, and after everyone remarked at how Marion Ross (the mom from Happy Days) aged so wonderfully, the ones who weren't snoring halfway through the movie, were groaning and sighing impatiently for the punchline to be delivered.",2,A Spoof On Spoof Movies,1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,2598,"['whole', 'business', 'there', 'people', 'spoofing', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'painting', 'saw', 'funny', 'one', 'mustache', 'painted', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'photocopied', 'picture', 'sent', 'someone', 'Superhero', 'Movie', 'nutshell.Not', 'only', '**insert', 'movie', 'genre**', 'MOVIE', 'genre', 'also', 'compete', 'smarter', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'spoof', 'comedies', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Simpsons', 'point', 'certain', 'devices', 'have', 'established', 'de', 'rigueur', 'spoof', 'vocabulary', 'prolonged', 'flatulence', 'polite', 'girls', 'school', 'group', 'segregation', 'ie', 'are', 'goths', 'are', 'jocks', 'general', 'boy-meets-girl', 'awkwardness', '.David', 'Zucker', 'producer', 'movie', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'name', 'Zucker', 'Jim', 'Abrahams', 'invented', 'spoof', 'movie', 'genre', 'Kentucky', 'Fried', 'Movie', 'Police', 'Squad', 'Airplane', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'Zucker', 'featured', 'actor', 'Superhero', 'Movie', 'too', 'spoofing', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'doing', 'things', 'one', 'come', 'expect', 'senile', 'Lt.', 'Frank', 'Drebin', 'do.The', 'point', 'movie', 'might', 'appear', 'be', 'spoofing', 'Spiderman', 'X-men', 'Batman', 'surface', 'nonsequel', 'sequel', 'really', 'following', 'strict', 'formula', 'according', 'spoof', 'movie', 'rules', 'Superhero', 'Movie', 'really', 'sequel', 'parody', 'movie', 'genre', 'once', 'become', 'aware', 'precedent', 'almost', 'tired', 'exercise', 'same', 'worn', 'routines.Stars', 'who', 'are', 'featured', 'cover', 'appear', '30', 'seconds', 'Spoof', 'movies', 'were', 'known', 'cameos', 'never', 'displayed', 'so', 'audaciously', 'marketing', 'tool', 'Part', 'fun', 'watching', 'earlier', 'spoof', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'sudden', 'unannounced', 'appearance', 'big', 'star', 'Who', 'could', 'forget', 'absolute', 'greatest', 'spoof', 'scene', 'Airplane', 'Barbara', 'Billingsley', 'known', 'America', '50s', 'white', 'suburban', 'mom', 'June', 'Cleaver', 'speaking', 'hardcore', 'street', 'jive', 'two', 'black', 'afroed', 'guys', 'felt', 'much', 'talent', 'was', 'wasted', 'Superhero', 'Movie', 'Given', 'better', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'funnier.The', 'story', 'presented', 'episodic', 'manner', 'one', 'contrived', 'scene', 'Which', 'fine', 'depending', 'who', 'are', 'Comedy', 'very', 'subjective', 'When', 'watched', 'teenage', 'relatives', 'were', 'entertained', 'giggled', 'OMG', 'totally', 'so', 'retarded', 'Then', 'watched', 'guys', '40s', 'everyone', 'remarked', 'how', 'Marion', 'Ross', 'mom', 'Happy', 'Days', 'aged', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'ones', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'snoring', 'halfway', 'movie', 'were', 'groaning', 'sighing', 'impatiently', 'punchline', 'be', 'delivered']",N/A

J Rey,"[1, 1]","The creators of ""Scary Movie"" and ""The Naked Gun"" set their sights on the comic book genre in the latest big screen parody ""Superhero Movie"". After being bitten by a genetically enhanced super dragonfly, high school student Rick Riker (Drake Bell) develops superhuman abilities and learns that with great power comes great responsibility. Rick becomes the masked crime fighter Dragonfly and battles the life-draining villain Hourglass (Christopher McDonald) who seeks to become immortal by killing thousands of people. ""Superhero Movie"" is a decent spoof of the blockbuster ""Spider-Man"" franchise and other comic book movies like ""Batman Begins"", ""Fantastic Four"" and ""X-Men"". The 2008 comedy delivers a good dose of sight gags and gross-out humor. The cast also includes Sara Paxton, Kevin Hart, Brent Spiner, Jeffrey Tambor, Marion Ross, Tracy Morgan and Leslie Nielsen. ""Superhero Movie"" is a fair improvement over such recent lame parodies like ""Date Movie"", ""Epic Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans"".If you liked ""Superhero Movie"" in theaters, then you might want to check out the Extended Edition on DVD. The 2008 spoof of comic book blockbusters is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The extended edition includes a few minutes of additional footage not seen in theaters. The picture quality is very good and its 5.1 Dolby Digital sound is fairly enjoyable.

The movie also features Marion Ross of Happy Days fame, and Leslie Nielsen, who I can't believe is still making movies after all these years! Leslie Nielsen has some of the funniest lines in this movie too by the way, especially if you watch the deleted scenes.The awesome Christopher McDonald also gives a great performance as Rick Riker's nemesis, Lou Landers, whose alter ego is the villain known as The Hourglass.

Produced by Bob and Harvey Weinstein and David Zucker.Starring Leslie Nielson, Marion Ross, Brent Spiner, Robert Joy, Jeffrey Tambor, Robert Hays, Charlene Tilton and Pamela Anderson as The Invisible Girl.When teenager Rick Riker is bitten by a radioactive Dragonfly, he learns that with great power comes a great deal of crotch jokes and explosive flatulence.A not terribly inspired comic remake of the first Spiderman film. There are a few humorous bits but mostly this is just a scattershot series of gags and crude humor splattered up on the screen in buckshot fashion hoping something will stick. The film never actually satirizes the superhero genre but rather simply uses it as a pretext for whatever jokes were lying about David Zucker's desk that day. There are some lame potshots at THE X MEN, THE FANTASTIC FOUR and BATMAN and a solid one at fanboys and their conventions.Several of the jokes...particularly the one's involving cruelty to animals....were in more than bad taste. And I find something vaquely disquieting watching once respected actors and actresses like Nielsen and Ross degrade themselves. Almost all of their humor involves their senior citizen status and are less than flattering. Since I have extensive experience dealing with oldsters, one was thinking that this was not a matter of the elderly actors cashing their paychecks but rather doddering senile seniors looking for some attention and being exploited by the producers.

This reviewer actually laughed thoughout most of the film and perhaps it works on the grounds that Spider-Man is more accessible and recognised. Also, the film has a great ensemble cast of actors familiar with comedy from Nielsen, Marion Ross (HAPPY DAYS), Christopher MacDonald (HAPPY GILMORE), and Dan Castellaneta. One of the more hilarious targets is of physicist Dr. Stephen Hawking. In a bit of inspired casting, moviegoers will recognise character actor, Robert Joy (CSI:NY,*61) as having the perfect likeness to playing one of the greatest minds of modern science. The creators recycle some of the gags from AIRPLANE and NAKED GUN as a definite homage to Leslie Nielsen's past work, but are still funny in the context of the film.
