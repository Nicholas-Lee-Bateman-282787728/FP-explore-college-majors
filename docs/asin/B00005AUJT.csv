578869,A3PFMOTIGZN4VF,B00005AUJT,AD,"[12, 26]","I had never seen this movie, so I purchased a copy of it based on the multitude of glowing reviews describing it as a ""marvelous period piece"", ""exhilarating"", and ""a masterpiece"". No doubt these reviewers sincerely loved this movie. But be warned that most of the glowing reviews have left out some vital details, and they in no way prepare you for the assault that you will be subjected to when you watch this movie. This is not a particularly well done movie, nor is it an easy or pleasant viewing experience. I hope the missing details I fill in here will help others avoid the same mistaken purchase I made.I was interested in this movie because of the star, the late Nigel Hawthorne, who also co-starred in ""Yes Minister"", my favorite British TV sitcom of all time. Hawthorne was so marvelous in that sitcom that I wanted to see more of his work. Unfortunately, Hawthorne died shortly after making ""The Madness of King George"", and this movie is so bad that it tarnishes his acting legacy and leaves one scratching one's head as to why he did it.  Hawthorne's performance here is not very strong, and relies mostly on crude gimmickry to propel it forward. Many reviewers described this movie as a comedy. That may leave you with the wrong impression. It is by no means a comedy.  It tries to insert some comic relief here and there, but most of that is so heavy-handed that it falls on its face.  This is a heavy and ponderous movie, with very little genuine levity.In this movie, a relatively sane King George lapses into madness shortly after the movie begins, and with very little transition. One moment he's normal, and the next moment he's totally bonkers with no warning. He starts with a mad rampage through the castle, during which he busts into a woman's bedroom and demands that she hand him her ""pish pot"". The startled woman complies, and King George proceeds to hike up his night shirt and urinate into the pot. The folks in attendance note that his urine is blue. From here the movie takes a long and relentless descent into an obsession with excrement and other bodily functions. In fact, if this movie is to be believed, King George's madness consisted mainly of his inability to control his bodily functions, much to the embarrassment of the other members of the King's court.  One early doctor who attends to the mad King is himself obsessed with bowel movements, and constantly banters joyfully about ""fetid stools"" and the like. At one point, the mad king is outdoors on another mad rampage and suddenly gets the uncontrollable urge to defecate. He drops his drawers and defecates against a wall while those in attendance watch helplessly. In far too many scenes there is the frequent handing off of pots of the King's urine samples to various people in attendance, and the director played this up by making sure the sloshing sound of the urine was front and center in the audio mix. Not realistic at all. In reality, if there had actually been this much sloshing about, there wouldn't be a drop of urine left in the pot. Phony effects like this one give this movie a hokey quality. One has to wonder whether all of these sensational public potty activities actually happened in the prudish royal court of the time. One gets the sense that very little historical research was done prior to writing the script. For example, there was one conversation between several courtly ladies in which they were complaining about the ""bathroom noises"" that men make. The blooper in that scene is that there was no such thing as a ""bathroom"" back in those days. There are many similar historical bloopers in this movie. One of them was that it was never explained just what was the purpose of collecting all of the King's excretions. This was taking place during the period of the American Revolution. There was no biochemistry or medical science as we now know it, and no way to analyze the samples to determine whether there was a physiological cause to the King's madness. Unfortunately for this movie, the hokiness doesn't end here. It keeps getting worse.Very little effort was put into making this movie look realistic for the period. The actors have to be sporting the goofiest, fakest looking wigs in the history of movie making. The costumes aren't much better, looking more like what folks nowadays would wear to a garish masquerade ball to stereotype the look of past ages. The movie could have benefited greatly if it had a top notch art director with impeccable aesthetic judgment, such as Cedric Gibbons from the golden age of Hollywood.  But I think the weakest feature of this movie is the unrealistic portrayal of the characters. Most of the characters were so bizarre and exaggerated that they came across more as caricatures in a farce or satire than real historical figures. Virtually all of the characters seem silly and pompous, and none of them are allowed to develop and get fleshed-out enough to be believable. Yet this movie was supposed to be an effort to seriously portray the subject matter and the period. Most of the performances are weak. Helen Mirren, who plays the Queen, is unable to realistically portray the range of conflicting and gut-wrenching emotions that a supposedly loving wife would be going through. She just couldn't get a handle on her character. Geoffrey Palmer, who along with Hawthorne is another great British sitcom actor I love (he played Lionel Hardcastle in the TV series, ""As Time Goes By"") also seems to have no idea what to do with his character. As the movie progresses, he starts to have the look of a deer caught in the headlights. It's as if he realized that he was involved in a real stinker, but by that time it was too late to pull out. In fact, many of the actors have this same look.This is one of the few movies wherein I experienced a feeling of relief when it was over.  The movie ends almost as abruptly as it started, with the King suddenly getting his marbles back. Once again, the transformation is abrupt with almost no transition from madness to sanity. The doctor in attendance seems to take the credit for the cure, but it is never made clear what the cause or the cure was! Even though this movie wasn't made in Hollywood, it seems like modern Hollywood at its goofiest. The entire movie has an aire of the contrived, with little effort to comport with historical fact. It reminds me a lot of the 1984 movie ""Amadeus"", which made the similar pretense of being a biographical movie about the great composer, Mozart, but was actually one of the hokiest movies ever made. That movie transformed the musical genius into a buffoon who was obsessed with childish pranks such as breaking wind in public. It also concocted the implied murder of Mozart by his contemporary and supposed rival, composer Solieri. Yet there is not a shred of historical evidence.  All of the historical information points to the fact that these two composers were good friends, not rivals. The point is, if you liked ""Amadeus"" and had no problem with the liberties it took in re-writing and sensationalizing history in order to make a quick buck, then you will probably also like ""The Madness of King George"". They are in the same vein. But if you believe that it takes better judgment and higher standards to produce a movie that is both quality entertainment and an enduring work of art, then I doubt if you will like this movie.  In that case I suggest that you tread cautiously and find an inexpensive way to watch ""The Madness of King George"" before deciding to purchase it.",1,Warning: Rent Or Watch On TV Before You

578870,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005AUJT,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 2]","Frankly, I like my kings (or queens, for that matter), especially 18th and 19th century kings, to be villainous and inept. And of course, we descendant American rebel supporters of the revolutionary war against King George III of England have more than a few unkind things to say about his use of Red Coats and Hessians to deny our forebears their right to an independent state. However, apparently good King George had an afterlife, well except a little fetish about still calling us his colonies (which Prime Minister Pitt insistently, if futilely, reminded him was not the case any longer), guiding Britannia and the empire to rule the waves, being a good and gentle husband, a fine father (cough) and all-around jack-of-all trades in his tidy island kingdom. Except that little question of his madness (temporary though it was). And the maneuvers, by family and political foes, to get him out of the way, are what drive the core of this film. Oh, and a very disturbing inside view of the norms of medical practice in those days, as well.Since nobody, or at least nobody shown in the film, had a serious clue as to the king's malady (except those telltale urine samples).least of the ""doctors"" the old tried and true try anything and everything, quack or sound, to see if the king can recover was the order of the day. However not everyone was committed to that recovery, or a safe and speedy recovery, and that is where the family and political plots thicken. Son George (the heir apparent) was linked with the so-pictured nefarious Whigs (led by Mr. Fox) to declare a regency on his behalf. The Tory Mr. Pitt was linked with keeping his job and that depended on the king's speedy recover. Pitt moved might and main to insure that recover, and to insure a delay in a parliamentary vote on the regency question. All of this is done with a certain wit, including by the king in his lucid moments. But all's well that ends well, the king recovered, his family is reconciled with his longevity, and he continued to rule those Britannia waves.A word on the acting here. Nigel Hawthorne shines as the lucid, reflective, just momentarily mad, witty farmer King George. Except, again, on that little buggy  issue of the colonies. His performance here is the best public relations the old king has had in a couple of centuries. And, of course, Helen Mirren (who else?) as his steadfast queen and main champion (beyond Mr. Pitt) is well, queenly. Apparently she has the lock on playing British queens, and playing them with a certain style. Finally, since everybody and their brother weighed in on the nature of the king's malady, I will give it a parting shot. I am convinced, and I believe all reputable sources will confirm this diagnosis, that old King George suffered from advanced imperialitis and those ""colonists"" who formed these United States caused him his reflex attack. By the way is it not about time for starters, among other things, to abolish that deadweight monarchy over there in Great Britian.  This film is prima facie evidence for that proposition,",4,On The Question Of Abolishing The British Monarchy,1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,3064,"['Frankly', 'like', 'kings', 'queens', 'matter', 'especially', '18th', '19th', 'century', 'kings', 'be', 'villainous', 'inept', 'course', 'descendant', 'American', 'rebel', 'supporters', 'revolutionary', 'war', 'King', 'George', 'III', 'England', 'have', 'more', 'few', 'unkind', 'things', 'say', 'use', 'Red', 'Coats', 'Hessians', 'deny', 'forebears', 'right', 'independent', 'state', 'However', 'apparently', 'good', 'King', 'George', 'had', 'afterlife', 'well', 'little', 'fetish', 'still', 'calling', 'colonies', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Pitt', 'insistently', 'futilely', 'reminded', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'longer', 'guiding', 'Britannia', 'empire', 'rule', 'waves', 'being', 'good', 'gentle', 'husband', 'fine', 'father', 'cough', 'all-around', 'jack-of-all', 'trades', 'tidy', 'island', 'kingdom', 'little', 'question', 'madness', 'temporary', 'was', 'maneuvers', 'family', 'political', 'foes', 'get', 'way', 'are', 'what', 'drive', 'core', 'film', 'Oh', 'very', 'disturbing', 'view', 'norms', 'medical', 'practice', 'days', 'well.Since', 'nobody', 'least', 'nobody', 'shown', 'film', 'had', 'serious', 'clue', 'king', 'malady', 'telltale', 'urine', 'samples', '.least', 'doctors', 'old', 'tried', 'true', 'try', 'anything', 'everything', 'quack', 'sound', 'see', 'king', 'can', 'recover', 'was', 'order', 'day', 'However', 'not', 'everyone', 'was', 'committed', 'recovery', 'safe', 'speedy', 'recovery', 'where', 'family', 'political', 'plots', 'thicken', 'Son', 'George', 'heir', 'apparent', 'was', 'linked', 'so-pictured', 'nefarious', 'Whigs', 'led', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'declare', 'regency', 'behalf', 'Tory', 'Mr.', 'Pitt', 'was', 'linked', 'keeping', 'job', 'depended', 'king', 'speedy', 'recover', 'Pitt', 'moved', 'might', 'main', 'insure', 'recover', 'insure', 'delay', 'parliamentary', 'vote', 'regency', 'question', 'done', 'certain', 'wit', 'including', 'king', 'lucid', 'moments', 'well', 'well', 'king', 'recovered', 'family', 'reconciled', 'longevity', 'continued', 'rule', 'Britannia', 'waves.A', 'word', 'acting', 'here', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'shines', 'lucid', 'reflective', 'just', 'momentarily', 'mad', 'witty', 'farmer', 'King', 'George', 'Except', 'again', 'little', 'buggy', 'issue', 'colonies', 'performance', 'here', 'best', 'public', 'relations', 'old', 'king', 'had', 'couple', 'centuries', 'course', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'who', 'else', 'steadfast', 'queen', 'main', 'champion', 'Mr.', 'Pitt', 'well', 'queenly', 'Apparently', 'lock', 'playing', 'British', 'queens', 'playing', 'certain', 'style', 'Finally', 'everybody', 'brother', 'weighed', 'nature', 'king', 'malady', 'will', 'give', 'parting', 'shot', 'am', 'convinced', 'believe', 'reputable', 'sources', 'will', 'confirm', 'diagnosis', 'old', 'King', 'George', 'suffered', 'advanced', 'imperialitis', 'colonists', 'who', 'formed', 'United', 'States', 'caused', 'reflex', 'attack', 'way', 'not', 'time', 'starters', 'other', 'things', 'abolish', 'deadweight', 'monarchy', 'there', 'Great', 'Britian', 'film', 'prima', 'facie', 'evidence', 'proposition']",N/A

While politicos scheme and try to take advantage of the situation, the king's doctors attempt to treat him using a medical science that is scarcely above medieval. One lone doctor, Dr. Willis, eschews the quackery of the day, focusing of behavior modification, adding much to the poor king's woes. This is the story of the Regency Crisis of 1788, a time of madness, both for the king and for the kingdom itself!This movie is based on an acclaimed play, and won a number of well deserved awards. The movie itself is very entertaining; with the well-chosen cast pulling off an excellent production. Sir Nigel Barnard Hawthorne practically steals the show, portraying a man that was believable in his insanity and a figure of infinite pity, as you see him go through his tribulations. Even more interesting is the window that the movie opens up into early pre-modern medicine.

578872,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005AUJT,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","I don't know if I feel like continuing my rant on how mediocre `Forrest Gump' was, but every time I watch any film from 1994 I am left bewildered at the fact that it lost to that piece of Hollywood fluff.  Even a film like `The Madness of King George', that had no chance at winning top honors because it wasn't nominated, deserved a win over that horribly mediocre film; and knowing that Tom Hanks won the Best Actor trophy over, not only Morgan Freeman and John Travolta but also this tremendously moving and brilliantly controlled performance given by Nigel Hawthorne, is utterly repulsive.  I have not seen Paul Newman's turn in `Nobody's Fool' (why is this not on DVD?) but from what I've heard I can say without hesitation that Hanks was in all likelihood the WORST of the nominated five.Okay, no more about `Forrest Gump'; I promise.So, Alan Bennett adapted his own stage play for this big screen adaptation, and while I cannot say for certain that it is better or worse (I have not seen the stage production) I can say that this film is stupendous from start to finish and serves as one of the best films of the year that was 1994.  It boasts an intelligently woven plot (based on real events) with lavish set pieces, beautifully decorated costumes and most importantly, a slew of commanding and utterly unforgettable performances.The film focuses on the darkest part of King George III's reign, where he fell into a form of dementia and was stripped of power by his greedy and resentful son George, the Prince of Wales.  Exploiting the corruption within the castle walls, as well as the ignorance with regard to the King's mental condition, the film never skirts around the obvious but remains honest throughout.  It balances perfectly the dramatic tensions of the situation and the sly humor that makes Hawthorne's performance so legendary.Honestly; Hawthorne is a revelatory genius here.I don't understand the complaint that the film is not emotionally connecting.  I think the exact words were ""viewers are forced to fill in emotional gaps for themselves, and the whole enterprise has a pseudo-cinematic, self-congratulatory air"".  I'm sure this guy thought that `Forrest Gump' was a remarkable example of emotional honesty.  UGH, I promised I wouldn't bring up that film again, but really, that reviewer's explanation of this film mirrors my sentiments of the eventual Oscar winner.  `The Madness of King George' never manipulates the audience but insists on creating an honest and touching portrait of the loss of sanity, and the damaged caused by misunderstanding that sanity.  The film tackles a variety of subjects, from mental health to loyalty, greed, respect, love and power; and it handles all of them gallantly.With fine supporting performances by Helen Mirren (a sublime example of grace and distilled admiration and affection), Ian Holm (a marvel at subtle nuances), Amanda Donohoe (such chilling passages of repressed loyalties) and Rupert Everett (dastardly deception at its finest) as well as sharp dialog that captures wit as well as emotional relevance, `The Madness of King George' is a complete package.",5,Passing over this masterpiece would be sheer madness...,1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,3134,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'feel', 'continuing', 'rant', 'how', 'mediocre', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'was', 'time', 'watch', 'film', '1994', 'am', 'left', 'bewildered', 'fact', 'lost', 'piece', 'Hollywood', 'fluff', 'Even', 'film', 'Madness', 'King', 'George', 'had', 'chance', 'winning', 'top', 'honors', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'deserved', 'win', 'horribly', 'mediocre', 'film', 'knowing', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'trophy', 'not', 'only', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'John', 'Travolta', 'also', 'tremendously', 'moving', 'brilliantly', 'controlled', 'performance', 'given', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'utterly', 'repulsive', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'turn', 'Nobody', 'Fool', 'why', 'not', 'DVD', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'can', 'say', 'hesitation', 'Hanks', 'was', 'likelihood', 'WORST', 'nominated', 'five.Okay', 'more', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'promise.So', 'Alan', 'Bennett', 'adapted', 'own', 'stage', 'play', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'certain', 'better', 'worse', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'stage', 'production', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'stupendous', 'start', 'finish', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'was', '1994', 'intelligently', 'woven', 'plot', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'lavish', 'set', 'pieces', 'beautifully', 'decorated', 'costumes', 'most', 'importantly', 'slew', 'commanding', 'utterly', 'unforgettable', 'performances.The', 'film', 'darkest', 'part', 'King', 'George', 'III', 'reign', 'where', 'fell', 'form', 'dementia', 'was', 'stripped', 'power', 'greedy', 'resentful', 'son', 'George', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'Exploiting', 'corruption', 'castle', 'walls', 'as', 'well', 'ignorance', 'regard', 'King', 'mental', 'condition', 'film', 'never', 'obvious', 'honest', 'perfectly', 'dramatic', 'tensions', 'situation', 'sly', 'humor', 'Hawthorne', 'performance', 'so', 'legendary.Honestly', 'Hawthorne', 'revelatory', 'genius', 'here.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'complaint', 'film', 'not', 'emotionally', 'connecting', 'think', 'exact', 'words', 'were', 'viewers', 'are', 'forced', 'fill', 'emotional', 'gaps', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'pseudo-cinematic', 'self-congratulatory', 'air', ""'m"", 'sure', 'guy', 'thought', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'was', 'remarkable', 'example', 'emotional', 'honesty', 'UGH', 'promised', 'would', ""n't"", 'bring', 'up', 'film', 'again', 'really', 'reviewer', 'explanation', 'film', 'mirrors', 'sentiments', 'eventual', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Madness', 'King', 'George', 'never', 'audience', 'creating', 'honest', 'touching', 'portrait', 'loss', 'sanity', 'damaged', 'caused', 'misunderstanding', 'sanity', 'film', 'variety', 'subjects', 'mental', 'health', 'loyalty', 'greed', 'respect', 'love', 'power', 'gallantly.With', 'fine', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'sublime', 'example', 'grace', 'distilled', 'admiration', 'affection', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'marvel', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'Amanda', 'Donohoe', 'such', 'chilling', 'passages', 'repressed', 'loyalties', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'dastardly', 'deception', 'finest', 'as', 'well', 'sharp', 'dialog', 'wit', 'as', 'well', 'emotional', 'relevance', 'Madness', 'King', 'George', 'complete', 'package']",N/A

It causes mental disorientation.But if the illness had not made him mad, the treatment certainly would have. Remember that this was in the days of cupping and bleeding and treating mental patients rather like animals. Experimental animals, in fact. Much of the story centers around the barbarity of the treatment the king received.Most of the rest was the fact that the Prince of Wales, also named George, was impatient for power. He plotted to get his father put away in a mental hospital, and then had his friends propose he be named regent: that is, king in all but name. The king's ""handlers"" did not want to tell him of the bill brought before the house of lords, but Queen Charlotte, who loved her ""Mr. King"" as much has he loved his ""Mrs. King,"" brought a copy of the bill to him and he rallied to return to London just in time.That's the basic outline, but the details are what make the movie, along with the lush settings and costumes, some terribly clever by-play which is not so much as to make the movie a comedy, but just the sort of touch of comic relief as makes Shakespeare's most serious plays tolerable. In fact, part of the king's recovery had him reading ""King Lear"" in the garden with a gentleman, a lord and the doctor. He made the lord play the female role!I think it is pretty accurate historically, but I confess I don't know enough English history to be sure.

If he wasn't so fat in 1788, why does his father keep calling him fat? Hawthorne is wonderful, and Helen Mirren, on the evidence of recent films I've seen her in, is surely the greatest actress now living. I saw this play on the stage in London, with Hawthorne as George III, and the film leaves me a little uneasy. It seems to have been heavily tweaked for the American market, which is a form of cowardly pandering. However, what I suspect is a pretty accurate historical portrait of the king still holds up. George was a fundamentally sound, solid, down-to-earth, well-loved character. But can any king remain totally sane, regardless of whatever lurking physical ailment he may have? What about Presidents? Or film directors? Compare the sanity and wit of this film with Mad Mel's demented, fanatical and screamingly dishonest picture of ""The Patriot"", so-called. Instead, Bennett's script takes an ultra-cynical view of politics and royalty in general: the sense of unease grows when considering the caricaturish stereotyping of almost everyone else in the film. Ian Holm is rather a strange actor: he is always mesmerizing to watch, but also always turns in a somewhat similar performance. Were the contemporary allusions really necessary?

Perhaps I was distanced by the subject matter itself, a monarch who spent substantial portions of the latter half of his long reign in the throes of insanity. George III, ably played by British stage star Nigel Hawthorne, was by no means a bad man, certainly not the tyrant pro-Independence patriots in the American colonies said he was, but the sad fact was that this ethnic German who occupied the British throne was indeed subject to periods of both intense melancholia (in modern language, clinical depression) and even outbursts of full and total insanity. This film, set right after the end of the American Revolutionary War, and shortly before an even bloodier revolution flared across the Channel in France, concerns the King's first pronounced lapse into madness. (Later in life the king would spend his final decades sealed off in the back rooms of his palaces, lost to mental illness, his hedonistic son acting as Prince Regent, here played by Rupert Everett and shown as secretly married to a Catholic woman---the mother of all scandals should word of it leak!) The best parts of The Madness of King George are not the disturbing efforts of eighteenth-century physicians to cure their sovereign, but rather the depictions of the constant quibbling between those two Parliamentary rivals, Lords Pitt and Fox. G.F. Handel's music adds a nice flavor to the scenes, and Helen Mirren, truly a magnificent actor, is also expectedly sound here as Queen Charlotte, a woman who stands by her husband with a somehow motherly variety of loyalty.

Running about in one's bedclothes at four a.m. while shrieking and shouting incoherently, then swooping in to passionately kiss an unsuspecting lady of the court.Count me in.And the tone is set for THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE, a film released in the mid-90s and one I have desired to see for many moons.  I was fortunate enough to catch this movie on the tube recently, and was not disappointed.  The story of King George III's 'oddness' following Britain's loss of the American colonies is legendary; here we see His Majesty fall apart before our very eyes, yet an ebullient Nigel Hawthorne makes us smile at the good King's often salacious depravity.  Hawthorne was having a devil of a good time playing the mad King, and his performance shows it.  Obviously, the King's ever-eccentric misbehaviour is cause for national alarm, beginning with his Queen (a radiant Helen Mirren) and culminating in his treatment by a most unorthodox physician (Ian Holm, aka Bilbo Baggins).  And of course the King's 'illness' also provides ample opportunity for firstborn the Prince of Wales to plot and conspire to obtain his father's throne (a smug Rupert Everett is convincingly disagreeable).  The rest of the cast is stellar (being British, why wouldn't they be?), especially the stunning Amanda Donohoe as Lady-in-Waiting Pembroke.The historical speculation is King George III suffered from some type of genetic disorder that caused him to act quite mad; of course, this diagnosis was lost on the physicians of the time--accordingly the viewer sees a number of disturbing 18th Century 'treatments' performed on the King that will make one shudder.  Yet through it all Hawthorne never loses that ornery royal gleam in his eye, and with his royal physicians busily inspecting his chamber pot each morning to determine the King's health, the rustic charm that is THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE makes for some bloody fine entertainment.--D.

It is based on the life of King George III. America's King George. The year is 1788, and it is a time when the King has already lost the American colonies, and his power is being usurped by Parliament. Moreover, the King is having a nervous breakdown. King George (Nigel Hawthorne) portrays a troubled King, whose own jugdment is being questioned by everyone.Queen Charlotte, (Helen Mirren) portrays the Kings wife, and she stands beside him, even though she knows that the King is sick. The Royal physicians are baffled by the Kings illness, and eventually an outsider is called in to help cure him. The unorthodox treatment administered to the King by Dr. Willis (Ian Holme) is both sad, sadistic, and hilarious at times. Meanwhile, during this crises of government, the Prince of Wales (Everett) tries to conspire and assume the throne himself. The film is great, and the performances are outstanding.

Sir Nigel (as he was then fashioned) was perhaps best known by television audiences as Sir Humphrey Appleby, the scheming civil service mandarin from the Yes, Minister and Yes, Prime Minister series. I have admired him for years (and most recently got to see his great performance of Lear in London).This film also starred such British acting heavy-weights as Helen Mirren as the queen (think of the Prime Suspect series on the BBC/PBS Mystery, among others), Ian Holm as the physician (most recently noted for his performance of Lear, now available on video), and Rupert Everett as the chomping-at-the-bit Prince of Wales.The drama was intensified by collapsing or conflating actual historical events (alas, the play and movie would have one think that good king George actually recovered his wits and ruled; the truth is more sad, that he had recurring bouts of delirium and hysteria until finally succumbing to a dementia that lasted for years, and thus the Regency was established).Poor George has gotten a 'bum rap' in America for being the 'tyrant' against whom the colonials rebelled; history shows, however, that far from the being the evil dictator, he was in fact perhaps the kindest and most enlightened monarch in Europe at the time, well loved by the people, and concerned for government more than his own pleasure. Artistic, well humoured and well mannered, George was perhaps the last monarch in Europe who should have been so tarred by the negative history with which he has been saddled.This movie gives a little insight into that character of man. Set after the war with the colonies, George begins a slow process of deterioration. Seen here are the inhumane treatments prescribed for such people (I wonder if our modern medicine with machines and contraptions will look similarly barbaric 200 years from now?).Lavish sets and costumes accentuate the film to give a very royal feel. Political intrigue, disfunctional family dynamics, and social class consciousness all arise in differing measure to make this a truly intricate plot; however, much of the politics and psychology are more for modern audiences than are actual re-creations or representations.My favourite scene has to be the one in which George is reciting, in the gardens at Kew, a scene from Lear, in which Lear is slipping into madness.'Lear!? Is this wise?''I don't know, I'd never read it!' came the doctor's response.To see the king slip into sanity so subtly as his performance of Lear presents a slide into insanity is a treasure.The postscript at the end, a direct criticism of the royal family, in which the king pronounces that their main purpose is to be a model family (and the hint in the closing that the disease of porphyria, George's most-likely ailment, is hereditary) is amusing if not entirely appropriate.In all, a fabulous film.",5,Say hey!

The play was superb. This movie adaptation (1994) is excellent, and it releases the play into the broader world showing the royal panoply and vivid British scenes of Parliament and palaces. As in the play first produced in 1991, it stars Nigel Hawthorne as the witty, strong-willed, but for a time batty sovereign. Alan Bennett wrote the brilliant play and adapted it for the screen.At that point in history, no one knew why the king had gone off his rocker, but his urine had turned blue. Experts now think it was porphyria, an inherited disorder. George III had a long rule from 1760 to 1814. He was not an absolute ruler as was obvious in the movie when we see him maneuvering with William Pitt, the prime minister. It was George III who lost the American colonies, and he could never really forgive them for their impudence.His worthless wastrel of a son, the Prince of Wales, was dissolute and extravagant and portrayed in the movie by Rupert Everett as a foppish glutton and twit. The future George IV was frothing at the bit hoping that Parliament would name him Regent over his dotty daddy. The movie gives an absorbing look at the pageantry of a royal household, its opulence and intrigues. In one sense it's an historical costume drama, but it is far too entertaining and emotionally charged to stay in that category.This a very human drama in which we see a real human being suffering from bouts of madness. He is treated as a menial mental patient by his three servants who put him in a straitjacket to restrain him. The king and his queen (Helen Mirren) are a loving couple who address each other as Mr. King or Mrs. King. The court can tell when George is going off on a tangent when he start uttering ""What! What!"" There's one hilarious scene when the daffy king has entertainers at a court presentation begin again their performance.Nigel Hawthorne is masterful as the king who gradually comes back to sanity by the intervention of a clever doctor-veterinarian whose tough-minded therapy program works.

Nigel Hawthorne brilliantly plays the role of the King, creating a benevolent personage, a sort of aristocratic populist, who is, at heart, a family man. Yet, he understands, all too well, his role as King. His Queen, a loving and caring wife, is played to perfection by Helen Mirren. Rupert Everett wonderfully plays the part of their eldest son, the indolent Prince of Wales.The King begins his strange journey along the highway of dementia by shouting obscenities and behaving in a shockingly unseemly fashion towards his Queen's gorgeous lady-in-waiting, Lady Pembroke, played to ice maiden perfection by the always stunning Amanda Donohoe. He undergoes a total personality change. His doctor is mystified by these mental, as well as physical changes, which are broken up by moments of lucidity.The Prince of Wales see this weakness in his father as an opportunity for him to make a bid for control of the crown, and he rallies a slew of supporters. The ensuing palace intrigues depict the gamesmanship in which the King's supporters involve themselves in order for the King not to lose his crown in addition to his wits. The only question is whether the King will succeed in recovering his wits in a timely enough fashion in order for them to prevail.This is a wonderful film with a first class supporting cast. The production values and cinematography are also first rate, and the film won an Oscar in 1994 for its art direction. The film also addresses an issue that did, in fact, arise during the reign of King George III. It is now believed that the King may have suffered from a hereditary illness of the nervous system known as Porphyria.

But the most remarkable thing about this movie is how well each actor fits his or her part, and the pace of this drama. First of all, the acting is wonderful, but this movie was also wonderfully casted. Nigel Hawthorne blew me away with his hilarious, deep and believable portrayal of George III. His madness was heartbreaking and painful for the audience and his sane George the Third was funny in such a way that you couldn't help but root for him. Rupert Everett was simply so detestable that by the end of the movie I couldn't watch any movie with him in it without feeling a little hostile. Helen Mirren is, as always, pitch perfect in her portrayal and absolutely beautiful as Queen Charlotte. The environment created by this wonderful ensemble cast makes the movie exciting and the kind of film that elicits a real emotional response.

Sherwin,"[2, 3]","The Madness of King George tells the story of how King George III of England suffered from what appeared to be dementia; and the film explores the political effects, backstabbing and all, that occurred when he was unable to rule. The casting was very well done and the actors give outstanding performances that are convincing every step of the way. They could have cut a minute or two out of the film here and there to make the plot just a bit tighter but this is a minor quibble. The choreography and the cinematography were brilliantly done; the script was well written and the costumes and sets reflect great forethought.When the action begins, we quickly meet King George III of England (Nigel Hawthorne) and Queen Charlotte (Helen Mirren). They are quite happy together; they have brought fifteen children into the world as well. We also meet the somewhat lazy, power-hungry and very greedy Prince of Wales (Rupert Everett) who can't wait to be King. Unfortunately for King George, he does begin to show signs of dementia with unusual, unpredictable behavior even in public, including rubbing his behind against a lady's behind and shoving a musician aside during a concert to play the harpsichord himself! The people in the King's inner circle are at first shocked and then increasingly convinced that he is truly not well--and unfit to rule the country if he is having so much trouble controlling and caring for himself as well.The political jockeying for power is intense. The Prince of Wales can think of nothing more then becoming Regent, ""King in all but name,"" even though he would be shoving his own father into what could be a most reclusive existence, something that horrifies Queen Charlotte. The Queen herself is not permitted to see the King; and in Parliament we see two rivals for power (and the job of Prime Minister), Mr. Pitt (Julian Wadham) and Mr. Fox (Jim Carter) quickly square off and it's isn't very pretty. Lady Pembroke (Amanda Donohoe) does what she can to try to get the Queen to see the King; and the poor King is under the ""care"" of what would be considered today the most sadistic Dr. Willis (Ian Holm).Does King George ever get better or does his own son, the Prince of Wales become Regent? How does Dr. Willis try to cure the King? No spoilers here--watch and find out!The DVD doesn't come with any bonus features; I wish it had but of course the movie itself is the attraction.I highly recommend this film on DVD for fans of the actors in the movie; they give stunning performances.

The extremely foppish portrayal by Rupert Murdoch, as Prince of Wales, and his sidekick the Duke of York seems at odds with the way Hawthorne and Mirren portrayed their roles as the Royal Couple.  I understand the tension that the film was trying to convey between the King and his covetous son.  However, in both costume and acting, the characters seemed like two separate films.  Additionally, although Helen Mirren gave a fine performance as the loyal Queen Charlotte, her accent wasn't consistent.  Midway through the film her accent seemed to change from high English to something ""foreign"".  Until then, I thought she was of British heritage.  When the accent was noticeable, I wasn't sure if she was supposed to be French (consistent with the name) or German, e.g. when she pronounced ""we"" as ""ve"" in one bedroom scene.The movie did a good job of revealing the tortuous and bizarre notions of medicine during this time.  However, it wasn't clear if the film wanted to portray Ian Holmes as a real factor in the King's recovery or not.  He seemed quite stern and unfeeling toward his patient.Porphyria, the actual medical disease the King suffered from, is finally revealed in a screen commentary at the end of the film.

578910,A1V6X3STFFESI3,B00005AUJT,neverwithoutespresso,"[0, 0]","I count this movie as one of the best I have ever seen.The director, screenwriter, costume designer, art director, and actors take what is a less-than-fascinating incident in the life of a (less-than-fascinating?) historical figure and, with artistic and intellectual brilliance, produce a luxuriant, vibrant, spectacularly colorful, intellectually stimulating and thought-provoking film.  It is dramatized history and extravagant cinema at their best!In real life, George III of England suffered from what scientists think was probably porphyria, a disorder whereby liver enzymes fail to be excreted from the body and produce, among other symptoms, insanity.  The disease has remissions and exacerbations that are unpredictable, and we are watching the first time the disease presents itself in George III, in the 18th century, after England lost the Revolutinary War to the American colonists.It is not the king and his disease that make for great cinema.  It is the relationships among king, courtiers, the House of Peers, the House of Commons, the Prince of Wales, Queen Charlotte, the two court doctors, a country doctor who originates a sensible and relatively compassionate treatment for the mentally ill, and the people of England that make this a dynamic tour-de-force.  Each character is so incredibly alive and vivid.For example, one of the king's advisors, a Mr. Penn, a nobleman in the House of Peers, is so exquisitely portrayed that he could be a movie in himself: he is a dour, almost sour young man whose lack of humor makes him the [...] of jokes by his more fun-loving colleagues.  He dresses like a Puritan.  He sides with a Mr. Fox in the House of Commons and the Prince of Wales, who is going out of his mind in the restless anticipation of replacing his father on the throne, that the king should be removed if, indeed, he is insane, and that this should be done by an act of Parliament.  However, as the king's illness and treatment progress, Mr. Penn proves to be a thoughtful, moral man of honor and integrity.  He feels it is his duty to support the king as his subject as he struggles to break free of his madness.  When King George's recovery is imminent, although he was considering backing parliamentary revocation of the throne when the king was mad, he announces the recovery publicly, in Parliament, thus making insurrection impossible.In addition to the actor's splendid characterization, this character was enhanced (as were all the characters) by absolutely spectacular costuming and make-up.  Mr. Penn, in face and figure, happened to resemble an eighteenth-century man in a Gainsborough painting, and thus his slightly coarse, wavy, light-brown hair was teased into a Gainsborough 'fro, and he looked exactly as though he stepped out of an 18th century painting.  Perhaps the most delightful results of the hairdressers', makeup artists' and costumers' art was the Prince of Wales and his younger brother.  They were both portrayed as insufferable fops, and the aforementioned artists worked them up to a la-de-da beyond the last frontiers of outrageousness and camp that truly has to be seen to be appreciated.The net result of all of the above is that history jumps right into your lap.  Never has an epoch become more alive than in this film, from the details of costume and mannerism to the exposition of philosophical ideas and values that distinguished 18th-century England and were passed from her to her American cousin, even as they became separated.If you love history and love cinema, do not fail to see this film.",5,A GIFT OF HISTORY,1235001600,"02 19, 2009",2009,3564,"['count', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.The', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'costume', 'designer', 'art', 'director', 'actors', 'take', 'what', 'less-than-fascinating', 'incident', 'life', 'less-than-fascinating', 'historical', 'figure', 'artistic', 'intellectual', 'brilliance', 'produce', 'luxuriant', 'vibrant', 'spectacularly', 'colorful', 'intellectually', 'stimulating', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'dramatized', 'history', 'extravagant', 'cinema', 'best', 'real', 'life', 'George', 'III', 'England', 'suffered', 'what', 'scientists', 'think', 'was', 'probably', 'porphyria', 'disorder', 'whereby', 'liver', 'enzymes', 'fail', 'be', 'excreted', 'body', 'produce', 'other', 'symptoms', 'insanity', 'disease', 'remissions', 'exacerbations', 'are', 'unpredictable', 'are', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'disease', 'George', 'III', '18th', 'century', 'England', 'lost', 'Revolutinary', 'War', 'American', 'colonists.It', 'not', 'king', 'disease', 'make', 'great', 'cinema', 'relationships', 'king', 'courtiers', 'House', 'Peers', 'House', 'Commons', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'Queen', 'Charlotte', 'two', 'court', 'doctors', 'country', 'doctor', 'who', 'sensible', 'relatively', 'compassionate', 'treatment', 'mentally', 'ill', 'people', 'England', 'make', 'dynamic', 'tour-de-force', 'character', 'so', 'incredibly', 'alive', 'vivid.For', 'example', 'one', 'king', 'advisors', 'Mr.', 'Penn', 'nobleman', 'House', 'Peers', 'so', 'exquisitely', 'portrayed', 'could', 'be', 'movie', 'dour', 'almost', 'sour', 'young', 'man', 'lack', 'humor', '[', ']', 'jokes', 'more', 'fun-loving', 'colleagues', 'Puritan', 'sides', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'House', 'Commons', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'who', 'going', 'mind', 'restless', 'anticipation', 'replacing', 'father', 'throne', 'king', 'should', 'be', 'removed', 'indeed', 'insane', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'act', 'Parliament', 'However', 'king', 'illness', 'treatment', 'progress', 'Mr.', 'Penn', 'be', 'thoughtful', 'moral', 'man', 'honor', 'integrity', 'duty', 'support', 'king', 'subject', 'break', 'free', 'madness', 'When', 'King', 'George', 'recovery', 'imminent', 'was', 'considering', 'backing', 'parliamentary', 'revocation', 'throne', 'when', 'king', 'was', 'mad', 'recovery', 'publicly', 'Parliament', 'thus', 'making', 'insurrection', 'impossible.In', 'addition', 'actor', 'splendid', 'characterization', 'character', 'was', 'enhanced', 'were', 'characters', 'absolutely', 'spectacular', 'costuming', 'make-up', 'Mr.', 'Penn', 'face', 'figure', 'happened', 'resemble', 'eighteenth-century', 'man', 'Gainsborough', 'painting', 'thus', 'slightly', 'coarse', 'wavy', 'light-brown', 'hair', 'was', 'teased', 'Gainsborough', ""'fro"", 'looked', 'exactly', 'stepped', '18th', 'century', 'painting', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'delightful', 'results', 'hairdressers', 'makeup', 'artists', 'costumers', 'art', 'was', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'younger', 'brother', 'were', 'portrayed', 'insufferable', 'fops', 'aforementioned', 'artists', 'worked', 'up', 'la-de-da', 'last', 'frontiers', 'outrageousness', 'camp', 'truly', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'appreciated.The', 'net', 'result', 'above', 'history', 'jumps', 'right', 'lap', 'Never', 'epoch', 'become', 'more', 'alive', 'film', 'details', 'costume', 'mannerism', 'exposition', 'philosophical', 'ideas', 'values', 'distinguished', '18th-century', 'England', 'were', 'passed', 'American', 'cousin', 'even', 'became', 'separated.If', 'love', 'history', 'love', 'cinema', 'do', 'not', 'fail', 'see', 'film']",N/A

Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[0, 1]","I am in no way an enthusiast of either contemporary movies or of comedy films in general but the very idea of this offbeat 1994 presentation appealed to me enough that I bought a copy. (So what I'm really saying is that for those who do like more contemporary works, this flick might easily rate five stars for them.) Perhaps I'll watch it again but I can honestly avow that I did moderately enjoy my first viewing.The real George III (George William Frederick, 1738-1820) King of England and Ireland, was in fact mad as a Hatter. This affliction was likely brought on as a result of an hereditary blood disease known as porphyria. He was the King who lost the Western Colonies to the American revolutionaries. What the film does NOT allude to is the sorrowful later period of George III's life... and I will leave the topic there to avoid revealing any spoilers.THE STORY (the film): The Prince of Wales (George III's eldest son) wants to be King, or at least Regent which was pretty much the same thing in terms of personal and political power. He sees his chance to seize ruling authority as his father's public behavior becomes more and more ostentatious and absurd. The film exploits King George's madness by portraying his bawdy antics as humorous events, (at least from the viewer's perspective.) In any case, King George's supporters in Parliament hurriedly find him a doctor of sorts and from that point a desperate race ensues to ""cure"" his insanity so that he won't be unseated by his mendacious buffoon of a son.As I mentioned, Hollywood chose to exploit George's insanity for the sole purpose of entertainment, (which of course equates to dollars.) Similar film schemes have been effected on other unfortunate historic souls such as the movie about the badly-demented Howard Hughes,Melvin and Howard(1980). Some thoughtful film mogul later produced a more dramatic and respectful film about the eccentric millionaire:The Aviator (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)(2004.) Actually both movies were quite well-done, even if the earlier one might now be viewed by some as politically incorrect. The fact is I don't care a whit about such modern-day cultural trends and I think that the average person is in league with me on that point.But, getting back to the film under review, it runs for one hour, fifty minutes, is presented in enhanced widescreen, with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (16:9) -- so, unlike the letterbox format, it completely fills up the viewing area of a widescreen television.The cinematography of this film is outstanding and the acting is nothing short of superb as are the captivating set locations. If this movie were instead a book it would be a page-turner -- it never drags in the slightest. And as always, Helen Mirren (as Queen Charlotte, George's wife) who seems to pop up in every first-quality film involving the British Royals (such as:The Queen) bequeaths us with yet another outstanding performance. Veteran actor Nigel Hawthorne is equally convincing as the irreverent lunatic King. I should additionally mention that if you are a fan of either Handel'sHandel: Water Musicor hisHandel - Royal Fireworks Music  Concerto Grosso ""Alexander's Feast""  Overtures / The English Concert  Pinnock, then you're in for a pleasant (and sometimes humorous) experience.What more can I say? This movie involves some drama and mostly comedy. I don't really need this DVD in my collection (which chiefly consists of old jungle and western serials, 70s mini-series, and black-and-white era mysteries and horrors flicks) so I actually should have rented it instead; however, this DVD can be bought so cheaply at this point that a purchase might end up being the better deal.

578919,A2YRDIRL316QJL,B00005AUJT,Stephen M. Kerwick,"[4, 4]","I found Madness to be one of the very best period pieces I have seen.  The insights into the working of British government at a time when the Monarchy was in its last stages of real day to day power were very enlightening.  Similarly, the parliamentary maneuvering between Pitt the younger's Tories and Charles James Fox's radical Whigs, and their tie ins to competing factions of the Royal Family was simply fascinating.  Americans are generally unaware of what a critical point in history this was, as the Foxites were very much in sympathy with the Jacobin regicides in France and the absence of England's opposition to the nouvelle regime there would likely have led to a French republican hegemony in Europe with untold consequences.I disagree with some of the reviewers here who view George III as a great and good king, but he was certainly not the monster viewed in America either.  To the contrary both the film and history demonstrate that he was a rather stodgy, unimaginitive man of mediocre talents but great force of will.  When his physiological/psychological disease takes grip, the consequences are shocking, if not quite tragic.  The real dramatic impact of the film comes with the effect of changed circumstances on the supporting characters, who take stances on one assumption and wind up surprised and vulnerable when those assumptions are no longer true.  The more altruistic that a nonroyal character's behaviour has been, the harder the fall or disillusionment that results.  Conversely, the more cynical a character's approach is, the better he or she comes out in the end.

But when seeing it, I realized how sad and depressing it was.  I for one wouldn't put it as a comedy.  True, a few moments where light and warmed your heart, but for the most part its sad and bittersweet.  I found myself crying throughout the show.The acting was brilliant and the script was moving and it truly shows how George III suffered.Of course some things where historically inaccurate, such as the attempt on his life happened several years before; the map of America didn't look like that yet; and the quote the King said about sleep was actually said by Napoleon Bonaparte, and if you know their relationship, you'd know they never agreed on anything.It is said that the King suffered from poryphia.  I had a relative who suffered from it as well and it's not easy to deal with.I really feel deep sympathy for the King, his disease was horrible and his son was no better.I loved this show, though if you cry easily, bring tissues.",5,The Madness of King George,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,1083,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'film', 'remember', 'hearing', 'how', 'funny', 'people', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'liked', 'making', 'fun', 'King', 'so', 'when', 'seeing', 'realized', 'how', 'sad', 'depressing', 'was', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'put', 'comedy', 'True', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'light', 'warmed', 'heart', 'most', 'part', 'sad', 'bittersweet', 'found', 'crying', 'show.The', 'acting', 'was', 'brilliant', 'script', 'was', 'moving', 'truly', 'how', 'George', 'III', 'suffered.Of', 'course', 'things', 'where', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'such', 'attempt', 'life', 'happened', 'several', 'years', 'map', 'America', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'yet', 'quote', 'King', 'said', 'sleep', 'was', 'actually', 'said', 'Napoleon', 'Bonaparte', 'know', 'relationship', ""'d"", 'know', 'never', 'agreed', 'anything.It', 'said', 'King', 'suffered', 'poryphia', 'had', 'relative', 'who', 'suffered', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'easy', 'deal', 'with.I', 'really', 'feel', 'deep', 'sympathy', 'King', 'disease', 'was', 'horrible', 'son', 'was', 'better.I', 'loved', 'show', 'cry', 'easily', 'bring', 'tissues']",N/A

You will find his antics hilarious and yet pity him in the same instance, for how inaccurately his illness was treated for the times.I found the film to be suprisingly factual - even with the more endearing take on George's character/perspective. Ian Holm and Rupert Everret are both excellent, yet easy to detest in their roles as ruthless doctor and Prince, respectively.  But my favorites in the film were Helen Mirren and Nigel Hawthorne's as the King and Queen - the fact that he never took a lover (historically) shines through in their roles, and makes them more charming British monarchs to watch for a change!Thoroughly enjoyed this film.... a sad story underneath, but a delight in its delivery.",5,A suprisingly endearing take on George...,1225670400,"11 3, 2008",2008,783,"['Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'amazing', 'job', 'portraying', 'mad', 'King', 'George', 'III', 'will', 'find', 'antics', 'hilarious', 'yet', 'pity', 'same', 'instance', 'how', 'inaccurately', 'illness', 'was', 'treated', 'times.I', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'suprisingly', 'factual', 'even', 'more', 'endearing', 'take', 'George', 'character/perspective', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Rupert', 'Everret', 'are', 'excellent', 'yet', 'easy', 'detest', 'roles', 'ruthless', 'doctor', 'Prince', 'respectively', 'favorites', 'film', 'were', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'King', 'Queen', 'fact', 'never', 'took', 'lover', 'historically', 'shines', 'roles', 'more', 'charming', 'British', 'monarchs', 'watch', 'change', 'Thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'sad', 'story', 'underneath', 'delight', 'delivery']",N/A
