I expected something offbeat and campy, what I saw was another stereotypical and over exaggerated piece of throwaway nonsense.. The acting from Lewis wasn't the problem, it was the badly written script and most of the people working with her. The lines were too corny, and just horrible and unrealistic. The problem I have with most black films is that they are either hardcore thug, or judgmental, preachy, unrealistic and downright corny; there never seems to be any middle ground and everyone is someone you really don't care to know in real life... and the problem with this movie is that it's mostly the latter.. there's a boom mic that kept coming into the shot... oh, and the 30 second cameo from a crack'd out lookin' Whitney Houston didn't help either...

811657,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B0001NBMIU,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[4, 5]","I caught Nora's Hair Salon on Christmas Eve last year on UPN. I started watching the movie at 8:00; it was so terrible I wound up turning off around 8:20. If they tried really hard they could have made a bad movie.There is a total lack of effort onscreen. No one tried to make this movie work. Not the writers, because the script is about absolutely nothing. All I know is Nora owns a hair salon and people work there. I wanted to who Nora was, and why this hair salon is so important to the community. Why do people want to come here? Why do I want to know about this place? But the screenplay doesn't answer these questions. Instead it takes stock characters and a stock situation used in a dozen other hair comedies and warms them over. Since the writer took no time to tell a story, I wasn't interested in watching the rest of the movie.The actors don't try to act either. Most are just standing there saying their lines looking bored. I think I saw someone actually look at their watch a couple of times! Cameos by Lil Kim, Bobby Brown and others are a total waste; as they do absolutely nothing except look out of place onscreen. I guess the only thing of interest to them was the paycheck.Please don't spend your hard earned cash on this DVD It's a total waste of your time If the writers directors, actors and producers of this movie aren't willing to try onscreen why you make an effort to spend 90 minutes of your valuable time watching them do nothing. If you're looking for a good DVD buy Never 2 Big or Diary of a Mad Black Woman instead.

811658,A15MLF38WROSWU,B0001NBMIU,"S. M. Anderson ""sma331""","[7, 8]","After Barbershop you knew a hair salon movie would follow. Nora is a beauty shop owner. She is the mamma to everyone who works, or does not work in her shop. She is also keeping a secret, and also suffering from heartbreak. Nora also has a hair care line that she is hoping to sell, but finds the formula is too strong. You have Ming the manicurist who is a smart talker ""where you get your feet from Prison?"" You have sexually confused Devon, and his flamboyant ""boyfriend"" Delicious. Chole (Tamala Jones)is the hair stylist who thinks she knows everything and does what she wants.You have the Latina stylist by day and the stripper by night. Then you have Lily. Lily is a new stylist hoping she will belong to the ""family"", and dealing with a guy who is abusive to her. Lily is young, and she is naive. She has skills when it comes to doing hair, and great ideas that could help Nora. Bobby Brown also has a part in the film as Benny, he is the abusive guy who won't leave Lily alone.This movie had moments that will make you chuckle. The movie pretty much showed the whole dynamic about the beauty shop being a place where women congregate, talk, and share the gossip. My favorite scene in the movie is when this woman has a relaxer on her head and it starts to burn and burn bad. She does what every woman has wanted to do in a shop. Totally freak out!!! Now that was the one scene that made ma laugh. Another scene that I found funny was when some guy was sent to get Lily and Nora punched him out, and then everyone in the salon made him look like a woman while he was out cold.This movie is NOT the female Barbershop. It's no where in the same league. Lil Kim has a small part that is forgettable. (...) This movie was made with a small budget and it shows!! This movie rushed to beat Beauty Shop to the punch and in my opinion it failed miserably. Watching the making of the film was interesting.
