1070030,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000PE0G0A,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[7, 13]","It is my belief that superheroes are dark entities.  Let me explain further.  Over the course of many decades, Hollywood has attempted to grapple the popularity of comic book heroines by releasing big studio releases based on what they have seen.  It has been the opinion of many that these executives see color on the page, and immediately believe that the color is what has to translate onto the screen.  There have been countless examples of this happening in cinema, take the most recent ""Ghost Rider"", or ""Batman & Robin"" or even the debacle of the final X-Men film.  To bring it full circle, the reason that these films have not been successful, and why those smaller films seem to understand better the choices of the hero (i.e. why was ""The Punisher"" panned) and bring the grittiness to the surface.  It is when a director sees the hero as a fallen angel, someone who is just as dark inside as the villains that they fight (i.e. see the most recent ""Batman Returns""), that I believe they understand the printed page.  An example of a failure on both ends is the most recent direct-to-video release of the popular 90s comic disaster, the Death of Superman.  It stunned the world, killed the hero we believed couldn't die, and slowly and surely reconstructed the mythology of Superman.  This animated film destroys whatever soul was remaining within this story.  It takes creative risks, destroys sanity, and walks all over what is to eventually become of the Man of Steel.  To be honest, I like animated heroes (the Batman and early X-Men on FOX has been particularly entertaining), but this goes a bit too far and ultimately corrupts anything of value within the written story.What made the story of Superman's death enjoyable was that there was just this unknown beast awakened, so to speak, and fate brought these two indestructible beings together.  It was the battle that drew us to the page, it was the punches that Superman threw and the unknown of this being later to be known as Doomsday, which kept us turning page after page.  (Editor's note: I realize that perhaps Doomsday had been seen in other story arcs, that perhaps there had been other back story eventually created, and that other events had been leading up to this, but when I was young I just read this one particular story - the Death of Superman, and it is the basis for this review.)  To fill nearly an hour and a half, perhaps the creators of this film decided they needed to bring Luther in to prove that they were making a Superman story, perhaps they needed to demonstrate a pathetic love story between Superman and Lane, perhaps they needed to show mass destruction in which people HAD TO HAVE died or been wounded, but it was done so poorly that it transformed a good idea direct-to-DVD to a DVD destined to be eventually found in the $1 bin.  They story should have revolved around the big meeting between Doomsday and Superman, but instead the culmination involved this sub-story with Lex Luthor.  I was hurt.  Everything from Olsen getting a job at a trashy magazine, to the cheap secondary villain, to renegade clones just hurt over time.  This was not the story of Superman fighting Doomsday, but instead several small stories using that brief moment to grow.  It was not the excitement that I anticipated, nor wanted.With the story in ruins, one would hope that the voice talent would at least bring a level of professionalism to the table, but again, I have been wrong many times before.  Adam Baldwin is a ""Firefly"" god, but he doesn't quite have the power for Superman's voice.  There wasn't the strength or humanity behind it, but simply your average man's voice behind the blue suit and cape.  Anne Heche, voicing Lois Lane, seemed (and sounded) like she had been smoking twelve packs a day.  It sounded like Anne Heche doing voice work on an animated film, not an actual character on screen.  The rest were equally as bad.  Case in point, if you need to use Kevin Smith's voice as a cameo in the film, than you need to realize that your film is failing.  He is not credited, but I do believe they used him twice for two insignificant characters, but it was obviously him.  There is one scene where Superman battles, well, with himself (when viewed you will understand), and the dialogue between the two are hysterical.  It is not supposed to be, but it had me nearly in tears.Story in shambles, voice work below average, what else could go wrong with this simple little direct-to-DVD release?  Two more issues arose upon viewing which will confuse the more novice film viewer.  Superman will not allow a child to be killed by Doomsday, but has no problem causing millions of dollars worth of structural damage to the city by merely hitting the beast?  Who eventually has to pay for the rebuilding?  Who made sure nobody was holding a meeting or having a small family reunion in one of those skyscrapers or obvious tenement buildings in Metropolis?  The big battle raged which was fun, but the consistency of this animated Superman was perplexing.  Why would he save one, yet endanger others?  Or, could it be possible that all of this section of Metropolis was empty at this time during the morning?  Too much chaos was happening to believe that nobody else was hurt during the rumble.  The second point, which is brief, but those understanding the comics will get it - why were there no questionable supermen born from this disaster.  Was anyone willing to follow the comic story at all - or was there more money in creating their own storyline?Overall, this was not the film I was expecting.  Again, having grown up reading that single volume of how the ""Man of Steel"" dies, I wanted to see perhaps a synopsis of his life, some of his adventures, all leading up (character development and story) to his big battle with Doomsday.  I realize that more happens afterwards, at least in the comic, but what was presented here, in this film, is not the world or story that I imaged.  In fact, all imagination was stripped away with the poorly voiced characters, the minimal ""darkness"" that needed to surround this iconic character, and the complete chaos caused with minimal consequences.  I must say that the one point I did like from this animated feature was the fact that people did die.  Not tons, but enough to surround the point.  The escape of Doomsday, the fight with Superman, and even Lex's creature all killed, and it was interesting to see that in this DVD.  In the end, it was a sorry, pathetic little film that is worthless compared to the comic it represents.  For those fans, or even us casual ones, this represented nothing but commercialism and capitalistic opportunity - two words that should not be associated with either film or the printed page.Grade: *

After watching it with my kids (who loved it, btw) I can honestly say it's not as bad as many have proclaimed.  First off, I really enjoyed Adam Baldwin as Superman (surprisingly so, since he was the opposite of a ""superman"" in the Firefly series) and James Marsters was brilliant as Lex Luthor.  I will have to admit, though, that Ann Heche was a poor choice for Lois.  I couldn't get her face out of my head from Six Days, Seven Nights, which was quite annoying as I got lost in the actual character when it came to the rest of the cast.As for the story I agree it would have been nice had the writers focused more on a world without Superman, but as to including storylines dealing with other heroes reactions I can't see how that would be prevalent in a Superman movie.  Had this been a Justice League film I can see where that would be justified, but this wasn't the case.All-in-all I think this was a solid film with pretty good animation.  My only complaint in this area would be the harsh lines on Supes face.  They made him look rather old.  Bottom line, if you're a casual Superman fan I can't see why you wouldn't want to add this to your collection.

The recently released Batman: Gotham Knight, Justice League: New Frontier, and now Superman: Doomsday all seem to push limits and go for a PG-13 rating by adding gore and profanity and a high body count. I guess they're trying to be edgy and attract older viewers, but I think this may put off some fans. I would not let anyone under 12 or 13 watch these movies. Gotham Knight actually pushes an R-rating with its bloodshed.But at least Gotham Knight had Kevin Conroy from the WB's animated Batman/Batman Beyond/Justice League reprise his role in all six shorts. In this Superman film, on the other hand, all the voices have been recast and the characters are drawn differently, so it barely resembles the superior Superman WB series. Instead of Tim Daly, we get Adam Baldwin as Superman, Anne Heche instead of Dana Delaney as Lois Lane, and James Marsters (who plays Brainiac on the WB's Smallville) as Lex Luthor. Baldwin, Heche, and Marsters do a competent job, but Daly, Delaney, and Brown were much better in these roles. (Powers Boothe was ok as Lex in Superman vs. Brainiac.) Swoozie Kurtz is good as Mrs. Kent, but where is Mr. Kent? In the WB series, he was alive.This is an entertaining film, with a thrilling battle between Doomsday and Superman at the beginning of the movie, and then another clash between Superman and his dark double at the movie's finale. But it's just not as good as the WB series.I never actually read the Death of Superman comic, but after watching the documentary extra chronicling the source material, I think maybe the movie would have benefitted hewing closer to the original storyline. I think seeing the four Supermen would have been pretty cool!I would recommend this movie, despite its flaws, but it could have been better with the original voice cast and without all the violence and hinted at sexuality.

Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[2, 3]","Digging deep beneath the planet's surface, Lexcorp accidentally unearths the merciless killing machine known as Doomsday. Immediately, the behemoth of rage goes on a rampage, destroying everything in its path, and all efforts to stop it fail.The Man of Steel, learning of the destruction and deaths in Metropolis, takes it upon himself to take the monster down before more lives are lost.The battle is epic.The action is huge.The consequences are dire.Superman fails, falls...Dies.Adapted from the biggest and most shocking comic book story of all time, Superman: Doomsday is the emotional and action-packed tale of the life, death and return of the world's greatest superhero.This story is dark, and not just because Superman dies. This isn't a kids cartoon. The themes are mature (i.e. Lois half-naked in the Fortress of Solitude), Lex Luthor, distraught over Superman's absence in his own weird way, is the most evil Lex ever seen in a cartoon and the things he does at some points in the film make you go, ""Man, that's evil. Not just evil. HUGELY evil.""What was most astonishing was the swearing. I never would have expected that from a Superman cartoon.On the plus side, the battle between Superman and Doomsday is the greatest slugfest this reviewer has ever seen in a superhero cartoon (and I've seen nearly all of them). The story is solid and packs a lot in given the amount of time Warner Brothers seems to allow for these direct-to-DVD cartoons of theirs.The animation is dynamic, the coloring bold, the art in the style of the Justice League cartoons.This DVD includes a few special features, most notably the enthralling documentary on the life, death and return of Superman, chronicling the death saga from conception to fruition, with interviews with the many artists and writers and editors on the project.Language warning: Cursing and blasphemyA.P.

From ""Batman: The Animated Series"" to ""Justice League"" these guys just churn out one classy flick after another. I believe that ""Superman: Doomsday"" is another gem. I dare say this is the type of quality they've been working up to.No, it's not the spitting image of the original comic book saga. It's more of a stripped down, alternate reality version. I was actually relieved that the creators focused on the core characters while keeping things simple. There is a plot twist but it's a rewarding one.There are a lot of impressive things about this movie. The first is Supes battle with Doomsday. Thanks to that PG-13 rating the animators were able to make it more violent and catastrophic than what it would've been with a G or even PG rating. Then there's the emotional backlash from Lois, to Ma Clark, to the Daily Planet staff to the whole world. There's some really moving voice acting going on in that segment.Then there's the plot twist. Yes, just when it seems like the movie is over something happens and things get really interesting. Overall, it's a great animated feature.

1070041,A3OLP2A09TCFU9,B000PE0G0A,Autumn Witch,"[0, 0]","This film was complete rubbish. I am a huge DC comics fan and a, not a particularly tough critic of these animated films/shows. But this was just horrible.First, it did nothing to honour the story it was based on but I could almost forget that if it hadn't been so bad in so many other areas.First of all I was really disappointed who this was so different style wise from the other Superman and Justice League animated shows of recent years. I have no idea why  the producers of these one-off films feel that they have to reinvent the wheel. They did the same thing with the recent Wonder Woman film. They introduce a new look, style and voices when its not necessary. The Superman and Lois Lane from the shows in the 90's would have been great in this but instead they ruin it.Even the new Lex was horrible. He came across as some whiny, spoiled loser. And just randomly he kills his most trusted partner for no reason. WTH?My next issue is why in these one-off films do they act as if there are no other super heroes? It would have been so much more powerful if Doomsday had beat the stuffing out of some other heroes before Supes got there. Also, having them at the funeral would have been great and showing them fail to keep law and order in the aftermath would also have added to the film.Now the most annoying and out of character award goes to Lois Lane. In this film they made her out to be a selfish, idiotic, spoiled, dumb jerk. You are supposed to feel sorry for her when Supes dies but she has been so horrible up to then you really can't. She was so annoying and at times you are thinking she has it coming when she gets hurt!Jimmy Olsen also is completely out of character. It just makes no sense how he acts. Dumb.And that's pretty much the whole film. Its switches from emotionless to annoying. You don't get behind anyone and you really don't care. This was the first of the post 90's DC cartoons that I actually watched the time for when it would be over. You just didn't care about what was going on.The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is that as films go there are a lot worse even though this film about Superman is just horrible its still better than some of the stuff passing as films these days.I think if you are not a huge DC fan and don't have a understanding of the DC animated stuff starting in the 90's you might like this film.

Bernier ""smdm fan""","[6, 9]","Hi all,Like everybody else I picked up the eventful comics that made up the death of superman storyline way back then and it was a huge thing.Today we get to see an animated version of these events and here is my review.ProsNice animationNice character designVery good voice acting.Intense fights and destruction.ConsMost of the movie happens at night. I have no clue as to why though. I guess the moviemaker got a deal on black ink for the film production.The biggest problem I have with this DVD adaptation is with the story. The only thing that remains from the original comic book story is the fight with doomsday and the death and funeral of superman. Everything else in the film before and after doomsday is made up fiction for the film.I really did not like the way Doomsday was handled in the film. The movie is called Superman Doomsday and you are lead to believe that this is the story while in fact it is really not the case.Yes there is this big huge fight which is extremely well done. But after superman apparently kills doomsday and dies soon after, we have no clue as to what happens to doomsday after. There is not one second of the film that shows how people dealt with doomsday...did they dispose of him? Where did doomsday go? I have no clue!  The storyline switches to a clone of superman story, the resurrection of superman and that is it.That has got to be the worst written bit of animation history that I have ever seen and they had the base material to write from.  Doomsday beats superman like he was a rag doll nearly kills him and then in the end he just disappears entirely from the film.I was not happy with that at all. Very poor story telling technique.I would recommend to people to rent it and only hardcore comic book fan to buy it but take it with a grain of salt as it is not really good.peace",2,"Stay away, Misleading title for the movie!",1190505600,"09 23, 2007",2007,1831,"['Hi', 'everybody', 'else', 'picked', 'up', 'eventful', 'comics', 'made', 'up', 'death', 'superman', 'storyline', 'way', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'huge', 'thing.Today', 'get', 'see', 'animated', 'version', 'events', 'here', 'review.ProsNice', 'animationNice', 'character', 'designVery', 'good', 'voice', 'acting.Intense', 'fights', 'destruction.ConsMost', 'movie', 'night', 'have', 'clue', 'why', 'guess', 'moviemaker', 'got', 'deal', 'black', 'ink', 'film', 'production.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'have', 'DVD', 'adaptation', 'story', 'only', 'thing', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'fight', 'doomsday', 'death', 'funeral', 'superman', 'Everything', 'else', 'film', 'doomsday', 'made', 'up', 'fiction', 'film.I', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'way', 'Doomsday', 'was', 'handled', 'film', 'movie', 'called', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'are', 'lead', 'believe', 'story', 'fact', 'really', 'not', 'case.Yes', 'big', 'huge', 'fight', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'superman', 'apparently', 'doomsday', 'dies', 'soon', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'doomsday', 'not', 'one', 'second', 'film', 'how', 'people', 'dealt', 'doomsday', 'did', 'dispose', 'Where', 'did', 'doomsday', 'go', 'have', 'clue', 'storyline', 'clone', 'superman', 'story', 'resurrection', 'superman', 'it.That', 'got', 'be', 'worst', 'written', 'bit', 'animation', 'history', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'had', 'base', 'material', 'write', 'Doomsday', 'superman', 'was', 'rag', 'doll', 'nearly', 'then', 'end', 'just', 'entirely', 'film.I', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'Very', 'poor', 'story', 'telling', 'technique.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'people', 'rent', 'only', 'hardcore', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'buy', 'take', 'grain', 'salt', 'not', 'really', 'good.peace']",Superman: Doomsday

It was an intriging year long comic book seriesThe Death and Return of Superman Omnibus. However when it comes to the DVD version of this story, I felt it was slightly lacking the epicness and the scope that the original comics hadThe news is not all that bad. The DVD  does have the new voice talent that is totally different from the TV Superman the animated series. It has interest vocal casting. Firefly's Adam Baldwin brings a different edge to Superman. Claney Brown may have been Lex Luthor on The TV animated adventures, but James (Spike from Buffy) Marsters nailed it on this DVD. Anne Heche's vocal Lois Lane is the weakest link of this piece.This DVD's  animation seemed like a little like  Jack  Kirby style comic art, rather the S.T.A.S or the recent Justice League cartoon. However this PG-13 cartoon lacks the luster that this year long graphic novel series had. Th battle royale, told in shadow and crimson hues,  is what gives this cartoon its PG-13 ratingAlso the main part of the story arc in the graphic novel was ""the funeral of a Friend"" storyline..which was also mostly delete in this 75 minute adaptation. I understand that producer Bruce Timm ideal is to let this be a stand alone piece (basicly a Superman only piece), but what is missing for me was the world grieving as a collective in the story arc that this film did not use. Note not another superhero shows up in his funeral which would seem strange in a world filled with superheroesOn the whole, this piece as a stand alone was good, but very rushed. For 75 minutes they jam pack the film, I wish this was two hours and they took more time to give more storyI hope the Derwyn Cooke's  The New Frontier (The Justice League)animated adaptation which comes out next year is fares better than this made for video animated DVD.Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD",3,A weak adaptation of The Death of SUPERMAN,1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,1943,"['enjoyed', 'story', 'death', 'rebirth', 'Superman', 'comics', 'then', 'graphic', 'novel', 'format', 'was', 'intriging', 'year', 'long', 'comic', 'book', 'seriesThe', 'Death', 'Return', 'Superman', 'Omnibus', 'However', 'when', 'DVD', 'version', 'story', 'felt', 'was', 'slightly', 'lacking', 'epicness', 'scope', 'original', 'comics', 'hadThe', 'news', 'not', 'bad', 'DVD', 'have', 'new', 'voice', 'talent', 'totally', 'different', 'TV', 'Superman', 'animated', 'series', 'interest', 'vocal', 'casting', 'Firefly', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'different', 'edge', 'Superman', 'Claney', 'Brown', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'TV', 'animated', 'adventures', 'James', 'Spike', 'Buffy', 'Marsters', 'nailed', 'DVD', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'vocal', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'weakest', 'link', 'piece.This', 'DVD', 'animation', 'seemed', 'little', 'like', 'Jack', 'Kirby', 'style', 'comic', 'art', 'rather', 'S.T.A.S', 'recent', 'Justice', 'League', 'cartoon', 'However', 'PG-13', 'cartoon', 'luster', 'year', 'long', 'graphic', 'novel', 'series', 'had', 'Th', 'battle', 'royale', 'told', 'shadow', 'crimson', 'hues', 'what', 'cartoon', 'PG-13', 'ratingAlso', 'main', 'part', 'story', 'arc', 'graphic', 'novel', 'was', 'funeral', 'Friend', 'storyline..which', 'was', 'also', 'mostly', 'delete', '75', 'minute', 'adaptation', 'understand', 'producer', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'ideal', 'let', 'be', 'stand', 'alone', 'piece', 'basicly', 'Superman', 'only', 'piece', 'what', 'missing', 'was', 'world', 'grieving', 'collective', 'story', 'arc', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'Note', 'not', 'superhero', 'up', 'funeral', 'would', 'seem', 'strange', 'world', 'filled', 'whole', 'piece', 'stand', 'alone', 'was', 'good', 'very', 'rushed', '75', 'minutes', 'jam', 'pack', 'film', 'wish', 'was', 'two', 'hours', 'took', 'more', 'time', 'give', 'more', 'storyI', 'hope', 'Derwyn', 'Cooke', 'New', 'Frontier', 'Justice', 'League', 'animated', 'adaptation', 'out', 'next', 'year', 'fares', 'better', 'made', 'video', 'animated', 'DVD.Bennet', 'Pomerantz', 'AUDIOWORLD']",Superman: Doomsday

Directed by Bruce Timm, Lauren Montgomery, & Brandon Vietti; it features the vocal talents of: Adam Baldwin, Anne Heche, James Marsters, John DiMaggio, Tom Kenny, Swoosie Kurtz, Cree Summer, Ray Wise, Kevin Smith, and Adam Wylie.I must say, I'm really impressed with the film.

1070050,A1JXUCWRKLB7ZO,B000PE0G0A,BountyHunter,"[2, 5]","I remember when I was 10 in 1993, when the ""Death of Superman"" shocked the world. I got the comic, which I still have along with ""Funeral for a Friend"", ""Return of the Supermen"" and ""Hunter Prey"". Those books captured the heroism, courage, adversity and triumph of Superman. Now we know that the DVD could not capture everything the comics did but it could have been more thoroughly written. Let's take a look as to why this DVD failed:1. Length of Battle With Doomsday-In the original comic, Superman battles Doomsday for an entire day and died at 6:23 P.M. Now we know the DVD could not have 6 plus hours of fighting but the length of the battle was ridiculous. The action was great but it lacked like many have already said, a dramatic/epic finish. When Superman dies in Lois's arms, none of the other onlookers seem to have much emotion and just ""stand there"". There is no ambulance or no one trying to recuperate him. Apparently, money was a reason the film was short, so why not just have the battle between Doomsday and Superman to last for at least 40-55 minutes and include the funeral for the remainder to leave us waiting for a sequel after a year or so? After all the title does include Superman/Doomsday. Then they could spend another 75 minutes on the ""Return of the Supermen"". I felt that the love story between Superman and Lois could have been reduced for other important elements.2. Cardboard People That Lacked Emotion-The character models looked unnatural and cold. There was a huge lack of natural emotion, like they were used to just fill in space. Even when there was grieving it felt fake. The animation overall was just lacking, although some of it was good. If I watch a movie, I want to have a connection with the characters so that I can remember them............in this movie this was not so. Why did they include a homosexual theme when Luther told Superman,"" who's your daddy""?3. Music Score-It could have been better but there should have been better more dramatic music accompanying the fight between Superman and Doomsday.I feel bad for so many of you who make excuses for this film. I know that you want to love this film, thus feeling compelled to make allowances for its shortcomings. Read the comics instead which would be ""Death of Superman"", ""Funeral for a Friend"" and ""Return of the Supermen"". To those who are curious to watch it, rent it, or wait for a price reduction. This movie had potential but it just did not cut it. Even if it is an adaption , it is no excuse for the lack of effort put into this film. I guess some of you will praise any product with the Superman shield on it no matter how bad it is.Too bad they did not get it right, for a properly written battle between Superman and Doomsday should make you come to tears. I doubt it if they will ever put Doomsday on the big screen so now we shall await to see if the sequel to ""Superman Returns"" will feature a cool villain or villains.",2,Has Very Little Substance,1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,2943,"['remember', 'when', 'was', '10', '1993', 'when', 'Death', 'Superman', 'shocked', 'world', 'got', 'comic', 'still', 'have', 'along', 'Funeral', 'Friend', 'Return', 'Supermen', 'Hunter', 'Prey', 'books', 'captured', 'heroism', 'courage', 'adversity', 'triumph', 'Superman', 'Now', 'know', 'DVD', 'could', 'not', 'capture', 'everything', 'comics', 'did', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'written', 'Let', 'take', 'look', 'why', 'DVD', 'failed:1', 'Length', 'Battle', 'Doomsday-In', 'original', 'comic', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'entire', 'day', 'died', '6:23', 'P.M.', 'Now', 'know', 'DVD', 'could', 'not', 'have', '6', 'hours', 'fighting', 'length', 'battle', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'action', 'was', 'great', 'lacked', 'many', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'dramatic/epic', 'finish', 'When', 'Superman', 'Lois', 'arms', 'none', 'other', 'onlookers', 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'emotion', 'just', 'stand', 'there', 'ambulance', 'one', 'trying', 'recuperate', 'Apparently', 'money', 'was', 'reason', 'film', 'was', 'short', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'have', 'battle', 'Doomsday', 'Superman', 'last', 'least', '40-55', 'minutes', 'include', 'funeral', 'remainder', 'leave', 'waiting', 'sequel', 'year', 'so', 'title', 'include', 'Superman/Doomsday', 'Then', 'could', 'spend', '75', 'minutes', 'Return', 'Supermen', 'felt', 'love', 'story', 'Superman', 'Lois', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'other', 'important', 'elements.2', 'Cardboard', 'People', 'Lacked', 'Emotion-The', 'character', 'models', 'looked', 'unnatural', 'cold', 'was', 'huge', 'lack', 'natural', 'emotion', 'were', 'used', 'just', 'fill', 'space', 'Even', 'when', 'was', 'grieving', 'felt', 'fake', 'animation', 'overall', 'was', 'just', 'lacking', 'was', 'good', 'watch', 'movie', 'want', 'have', 'connection', 'characters', 'can', 'remember', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'Why', 'did', 'include', 'homosexual', 'theme', 'when', 'Luther', 'told', 'Superman', 'who', 'daddy', '3', 'Music', 'Score-It', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'more', 'dramatic', 'music', 'accompanying', 'fight', 'Superman', 'Doomsday.I', 'feel', 'bad', 'so', 'many', 'who', 'make', 'excuses', 'film', 'know', 'want', 'love', 'film', 'thus', 'feeling', 'compelled', 'make', 'allowances', 'shortcomings', 'Read', 'comics', 'instead', 'would', 'be', 'Death', 'Superman', 'Funeral', 'Friend', 'Return', 'Supermen', 'who', 'are', 'curious', 'watch', 'rent', 'wait', 'price', 'reduction', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'cut', 'Even', 'adaption', 'excuse', 'lack', 'effort', 'put', 'film', 'guess', 'will', 'praise', 'product', 'Superman', 'shield', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'bad', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'right', 'properly', 'written', 'battle', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'should', 'make', 'come', 'tears', 'doubt', 'will', 'ever', 'put', 'Doomsday', 'big', 'screen', 'so', 'now', 'shall', 'await', 'see', 'sequel', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'will', 'feature', 'cool', 'villain', 'villains']",Superman: Doomsday

There is much more sexual innuendo in this movie between Superman & Lois Lane.in the Fortress of Solitude, first we see Lois, who apparently had just gotten done with a shower, coming towards Superman, wearing nothing more than a towel , & then when she states that she wished that they didn't have to come to such a cold place, to get away, Superman states that the Arctic is a much more secure place to disguise Kryptonian energy sources, Lois says-""You wouldn't use you heat vision on me, would you Superman?"" To which Superman says-""No, just my X-Ray Vision!""Then there is the seen when we see Lois & Superman on a bed, both dressed in bathrobes, holding each other, (& it's not hard to guess what had been taking place beforehand).And then, at the end of the movie, in Lois' apartment, we see Lois on the computer, & Superman comes out the bathroom, after having take a shower, with nothing but a towel around his waist!2. The violence in this movie is much more intense, than in many of the other Superman movies.Superman takes a horrific beating at the hands of Doomsday, and ends up massively bruised & bleeding.Also, we see how uncaring Lex Luthor is to his assistant Mercy Graves.Many people familiar with Lex, know that Mercy has been his personal assistant & confidant for what seems like ages. After Lex gets assurances from Mercy that there would be no evidence of LexCorps involvement in Doomsday's appearance, he calmly takes out a gun, & puts a bullet through her head!When I saw this, my jaw fell right to the floor! I knew Lex didn't have much humanity in him, but this was absolutely ruthless!Also, the style of animation is a little different, that we have seen.it is much more ""stylized"", & designed to ""imply"" human features, rather than actually draw them.This is certainly NOT a movie for pre-teen viewer because of the physical violence & sexual innuendos.But it certainly stands out, as one of the most exciting of all the animated Superman movies!",4,How can one stop the unstoppable?,1340755200,"06 27, 2012",2012,2260,"['*SPOILER', 'ALERT*Never', 'other', 'Superman', 'animated', 'movie', 'Superman', 'met', 'enemy', 'quite', 'this.I', 'think', 'ever', 'Darkseid', 'would', 'have', 'problem', 'something', 'creature', 'called', 'DOOMSDAY.This', 'movie', 'differs', 'many', 'other', 'Superman', 'movies', '2', 'aspects.1', 'much', 'more', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'movie', 'Superman', 'Lois', 'Lane.in', 'Fortress', 'Solitude', 'first', 'see', 'Lois', 'who', 'apparently', 'had', 'just', 'gotten', 'done', 'shower', 'coming', 'towards', 'Superman', 'wearing', 'nothing', 'more', 'towel', 'then', 'when', 'wished', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'come', 'cold', 'place', 'get', 'away', 'Superman', 'Arctic', 'much', 'more', 'secure', 'place', 'disguise', 'Kryptonian', 'energy', 'sources', 'Lois', 'says-', 'would', ""n't"", 'use', 'heat', 'vision', 'would', 'Superman', 'Superman', 'says-', 'No', 'just', 'X-Ray', 'Vision', 'Then', 'seen', 'when', 'see', 'Lois', 'Superman', 'bed', 'dressed', 'bathrobes', 'holding', 'other', 'not', 'hard', 'guess', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'taking', 'place', 'beforehand', '.And', 'then', 'end', 'movie', 'Lois', 'apartment', 'see', 'Lois', 'computer', 'Superman', 'out', 'bathroom', 'having', 'take', 'shower', 'nothing', 'towel', 'waist', '2', 'violence', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'intense', 'many', 'other', 'Superman', 'movies.Superman', 'horrific', 'beating', 'hands', 'Doomsday', 'up', 'massively', 'bruised', 'bleeding.Also', 'see', 'how', 'uncaring', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'assistant', 'Mercy', 'Graves.Many', 'people', 'familiar', 'Lex', 'know', 'Mercy', 'been', 'personal', 'assistant', 'confidant', 'what', 'ages', 'Lex', 'assurances', 'Mercy', 'would', 'be', 'evidence', 'LexCorps', 'involvement', 'Doomsday', 'appearance', 'calmly', 'out', 'gun', 'bullet', 'head', 'When', 'saw', 'jaw', 'fell', 'right', 'floor', 'knew', 'Lex', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'humanity', 'was', 'absolutely', 'ruthless', 'Also', 'style', 'animation', 'little', 'different', 'have', 'seen.it', 'much', 'more', 'stylized', 'designed', 'imply', 'human', 'features', 'rather', 'actually', 'draw', 'them.This', 'certainly', 'NOT', 'movie', 'pre-teen', 'viewer', 'physical', 'violence', 'sexual', 'innuendos.But', 'certainly', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'animated', 'Superman', 'movies']",Superman: Doomsday

WhenSuperman - The Animated Series, Volume One (DC Comics Classic Collection)began to air, I enjoyed it, but not as much as the Batman series.Now we have this, a 70 minute movie covering roughly the same matieral that was covered in, oh, about a year's worth of comics. Needless to say, the movie suffers somewhat as a result. You don't get to see the JLA fighting Doomsday, you don't see much of the funeral or the way Superman's death impacted the wider world, and you don't get any of the other Supermen, like Steel or Superboy. You DO get another Superman, but only the one.Plus a lot of what was done during the fight between Doomsday and Superman didn't make any sense. Why would Doomsday smack Supes around a bit, know that he's not dead, and go try to kill a few other people? Bad tactics. Make sure your enemy is dead before you move onto the next one. What is this, ADD Doomsday? (meantime, in Central City... ""Look, it's ADD Man! He's coming to save us! He's coming to- oh, no, wait. He's seen something shiny. We're doomed"")As this is a direct-to-video movie, they were able to ratchett up the language and violence by a fair margin. The film is PG-13 and looks it, so bear this in mind.The animation was, as I expected, top-notch. The acting was generally ok all around, but I REALLY missed Clancy Brown as the voice of Lex Luthor. The current fellow sounds more like Lex Loser and wasn't really memorable.This is an alright movie, but really more worth renting than buying. If Amazon allowed half-stars it would have two-and-a-half, but since it doesn't, I'll round it up to three.

Still, I was quite interested in seeing what they would do with this and the result is a mixed blessing.First, I wasn't a fan that Lois was hooking up with Superman, but not Clark (even though she strongly suspects they are the same anyway).  What made the comics so great in the Byrne era was the Superman was CLark's alternate identity and not vice versa.I also wasn't too crazy about the resolution of the storyline where they essentially mixed the Eradicator part of the Reign of Supermen with the KnightsEnd story from the Batman.What did work in the movie?  I liked Jimmy Olsen's character, who was pretty much following the same arc of the comics in the mid 90's.  I also liked Marster's portrayal of Luthor.  Although a bit cliched, the fake Superman was done pretty well also.  But what really made the movie itself worth watching were the two major fight sequences, both of which were suitably epic.Finally, the DVD itself is worth getting for the 45 minute documentary of the original Death of Superman, which was a great reminder of just how good that storyline was, and how much it helped rebuild DC comics in the early 90's.  There was also a passable, but brief, segment with the voice actors, although Marsters' portrayal of Luthor was left off for some reason.All in all, a pretty decent portrayal, even if it couldn't come anywhere near what they did in the comics.",3,Get it for the special features,1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,1615,"['Death', 'Superman', 'storyline', 'what', 'got', 'back', 'Superman', 'comics', 'early', '90', 'remained', 'fan', 'early', '00', 'when', 'change', 'art', 'direction', 'insane', 'plotting', 'pretty', 'much', 'killed', 'again', 'Still', 'was', 'quite', 'interested', 'seeing', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'result', 'mixed', 'blessing.First', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Lois', 'was', 'hooking', 'up', 'Superman', 'not', 'Clark', 'even', 'strongly', 'are', 'same', 'anyway', 'What', 'made', 'comics', 'so', 'great', 'Byrne', 'era', 'was', 'Superman', 'was', 'CLark', 'alternate', 'identity', 'not', 'vice', 'versa.I', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'crazy', 'resolution', 'storyline', 'where', 'essentially', 'mixed', 'Eradicator', 'part', 'Reign', 'Supermen', 'KnightsEnd', 'story', 'Batman.What', 'did', 'work', 'movie', 'liked', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'following', 'same', 'arc', 'comics', 'mid', '90', 'also', 'liked', 'Marster', 'portrayal', 'Luthor', 'bit', 'cliched', 'fake', 'Superman', 'was', 'done', 'pretty', 'well', 'also', 'what', 'really', 'made', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'were', 'two', 'major', 'fight', 'sequences', 'were', 'suitably', 'epic.Finally', 'DVD', 'worth', 'getting', '45', 'minute', 'documentary', 'original', 'Death', 'Superman', 'was', 'great', 'reminder', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'storyline', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'helped', 'rebuild', 'DC', 'comics', 'early', '90', 'was', 'also', 'passable', 'brief', 'segment', 'voice', 'actors', 'Marsters', 'portrayal', 'Luthor', 'was', 'left', 'off', 'reason.All', 'pretty', 'decent', 'portrayal', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'anywhere', 'what', 'did', 'comics']",Superman: Doomsday

With Batman: Under The Red Hood on its way to home video Tuesday, I'm looking back at the previous seven DCU films.Based on The Death of Superman storyline of the early '90s, this first entry feels a little rushed. The story flows very well but I can't help but feeling that Bruce Timm could've made it longer. There is no written rule that Direct to Video movies must be seventy five minutes or less (evident when they get to Superman/Batman: Public Enemies. I can understand consolidating the Superman impersonators into the clone but the other DC heroes should've made an appearance at the funeral as they did in the comic. Though the way Superman finishes off Doomsday in the movie is far more effective than how it was done in the comic (they just fight til they die). I really think they should've held off of this particular adaptation for awhile, seeing as how they had already done a ""Death of Superman"" two-part episode in Justice League and had incorporated Doomsday into that show as well (though his threat is not as big compared to this movie) so we're treated to almost the same exact story. Also the updating of the story to present times, what with Clark going to Afghanistan, is superfluous and unnecessary, they could've left the story in the nineties.The animation is great (it's Bruce Timm, what else do you expect) but my main gripe is the actual character models. They are clearly based on the animated series models but with slight alterations (such as those stupid lines on Superman's face and the fact that Lex's face looks like it might be a mask). Some were radically different than their original counterparts, such as Mercy Graves (but it looks like she hasn't got a nose in many shots except a side shot of her looking at Luthor) and Toyman yet his original animated series counterpart is far more disturbing and psychotic.The voice casting is alright (Andrea Romano has never failed us yet) but in my opinion, they could've done better. Adam Baldwin is good at Superman/Clark Kent but not as memorable as Tim Daly or George Newbern. Some deliveries feel flat and boring but he does deliver in the end. Anne Heche is good as well but again, not as memorable as Dana Delany. Heche doesn't have the spunk that her predecessor had but when the scene between her and Martha proves that she is worthy in the role. James Marsters gives Clancy Brown a run for his money. His Lex is psychotic and he seems to have a need to have Superman around, for without him, Lex has no purpose to show off his genius. The other cast members I'll give my quick opinion on; Ray Wise is great as Perry White but his scenes are too short to get an impact. Adam Wylie just furthers my dislike of Jimmy Olsen, he comes off as a jerk when he leaves the Daily Planet and even when he joins Lois, its too late for me to really care if he returned or not. John DiMaggio is funny as the new punk Toyman, a shame that his appearances are too brief. Tom Kenny is good as the Robot, having him inflect a subtle humor and proves that Kenny isn't always annoying in the characters he voices. And lastly is Swoosie Kurtz and Cree Summer; Summer puts on her usual voice that makes her recognizable but that's also a bad thing. Her voice is too recognizable from what she uses in her other work that she doesn't make Mercy her own when compared to Superman: TAS. Swoosie Kurtz is featured briefly but she did a good job with Martha, making her feel emotionally vulnerable after the death of her son and her bonding with Lois.Not a bad start to these line of movies but to add swearing and more violence should not be the reason to make these PG-13. The story must feel more mature and the extra violence and swearing should come naturally from it. This clearly could've been at least PG.",4,There Comes A Time When Even Gods Must Die,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,3891,"['very', 'thing', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'first', 'line', 'DC', 'Universe', 'Animated', 'Original', 'Movies', 'Batman', 'Red', 'Hood', 'way', 'home', 'video', 'Tuesday', ""'m"", 'looking', 'back', 'previous', 'seven', 'DCU', 'films.Based', 'Death', 'Superman', 'storyline', 'early', ""'90s"", 'first', 'entry', 'little', 'rushed', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'longer', 'written', 'rule', 'Direct', 'Video', 'movies', 'must', 'be', 'seventy', 'five', 'minutes', 'less', 'evident', 'when', 'get', 'Superman/Batman', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'can', 'understand', 'consolidating', 'Superman', 'impersonators', 'clone', 'other', 'DC', 'heroes', 'should', ""'ve"", 'made', 'appearance', 'funeral', 'did', 'comic', 'way', 'Superman', 'off', 'Doomsday', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'comic', 'just', 'fight', 'til', 'die', 'really', 'think', 'should', ""'ve"", 'held', 'off', 'particular', 'adaptation', 'awhile', 'seeing', 'how', 'had', 'already', 'done', 'Death', 'Superman', 'two-part', 'episode', 'Justice', 'League', 'had', 'incorporated', 'Doomsday', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'threat', 'not', 'big', 'compared', 'movie', ""'re"", 'treated', 'almost', 'same', 'exact', 'story', 'Also', 'updating', 'story', 'present', 'times', 'what', 'Clark', 'going', 'Afghanistan', 'superfluous', 'unnecessary', 'could', ""'ve"", 'left', 'story', 'nineties.The', 'animation', 'great', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'what', 'else', 'do', 'expect', 'main', 'gripe', 'actual', 'character', 'models', 'are', 'clearly', 'based', 'animated', 'series', 'models', 'slight', 'alterations', 'such', 'stupid', 'lines', 'Superman', 'face', 'fact', 'Lex', 'face', 'might', 'be', 'mask', 'were', 'radically', 'different', 'original', 'counterparts', 'such', 'Mercy', 'Graves', ""n't"", 'got', 'nose', 'many', 'shots', 'side', 'shot', 'looking', 'Luthor', 'Toyman', 'yet', 'original', 'animated', 'series', 'counterpart', 'far', 'more', 'disturbing', 'psychotic.The', 'voice', 'casting', 'alright', 'Andrea', 'Romano', 'never', 'failed', 'yet', 'opinion', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'better', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'good', 'Superman/Clark', 'Kent', 'not', 'as', 'memorable', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'George', 'Newbern', 'deliveries', 'feel', 'flat', 'boring', 'deliver', 'end', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'again', 'not', 'as', 'memorable', 'Dana', 'Delany', 'Heche', ""n't"", 'have', 'spunk', 'predecessor', 'had', 'when', 'scene', 'Martha', 'worthy', 'role', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'run', 'money', 'Lex', 'psychotic', 'have', 'need', 'have', 'Superman', 'Lex', 'purpose', 'show', 'off', 'genius', 'other', 'cast', 'members', ""'ll"", 'give', 'quick', 'opinion', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'great', 'Perry', 'White', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'short', 'get', 'impact', 'Adam', 'Wylie', 'just', 'furthers', 'dislike', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'off', 'jerk', 'when', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'even', 'when', 'Lois', 'too', 'late', 'really', 'care', 'returned', 'not', 'John', 'DiMaggio', 'funny', 'new', 'punk', 'Toyman', 'shame', 'appearances', 'are', 'too', 'brief', 'Tom', 'Kenny', 'good', 'Robot', 'having', 'inflect', 'subtle', 'humor', 'Kenny', ""n't"", 'always', 'annoying', 'characters', 'lastly', 'Swoosie', 'Kurtz', 'Cree', 'Summer', 'Summer', 'usual', 'voice', 'recognizable', 'also', 'bad', 'thing', 'voice', 'too', 'recognizable', 'what', 'other', 'work', ""n't"", 'make', 'Mercy', 'own', 'when', 'compared', 'Superman', 'TAS', 'Swoosie', 'Kurtz', 'featured', 'briefly', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Martha', 'making', 'feel', 'emotionally', 'vulnerable', 'death', 'son', 'bonding', 'Lois.Not', 'bad', 'start', 'line', 'movies', 'add', 'swearing', 'more', 'violence', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'reason', 'make', 'PG-13', 'story', 'must', 'feel', 'more', 'mature', 'extra', 'violence', 'swearing', 'should', 'come', 'naturally', 'clearly', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'least', 'PG']",Superman: Doomsday

1070064,AYRFLAT8VF732,B000PE0G0A,"DC_Fan_52 ""-Weasel!""","[1, 1]","My favorite comic book storyline ever has to be ""The Death and Return of Superman Trilogy,"" so when DC announced they were going to adapt the story into their first Direct to DVD feature, I was optimistic. The reality is, it never had a real chance at being an accurate representation of The Death and Return of Superman, it would take an entire 26 episode season of Justice League to present the story correctly, there's no way a 72-minute DVD was going to do it justice. The end result is an overall forgettable Superman experience.The main feature itself isn't bad, it's just incredibly average. As they point out in the commentary, this isn't much different than what they could get away with on Justice League. They made a great rendition of Superman's initial battle with Doomsday, but the real heart of the Death and Return of Superman Trilogy is really boiled down. What made the original story so remarkable was the impact Superman's death had on the world around him, other superheroes, and his closest friends and family. Here, we just get Lois and Jimmy. So, it's very quick, and that takes the weight from the story. In the source material, it feels like Superman is dead for three months, the movie makes it seem like he was dead for three days.Let me be clear, it's still a decent narrative, despite not measuring up to the graphic novel. The animation is very similar to the normal Bruce Timm style, all except for Superman's distracting cheekbones, and the fight with Doomsday looks great.So, it's only a 3 out of 5.But, you know what makes it really worth owning? (At least for guys like me.) This contains a special documentary called, ""Requiem and Rebirth: Superman Lives!"" a behind the scenes look at the creation of the original Death and Return of Superman Trilogy. It's great, I've watched it more times than I've watched the movie.So, if you're looking for a superhero fix, this one's worth a rent.

1070067,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000PE0G0A,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 2]","It has been 15 years since the release of the ""Death of Superman"" comic books which was one of the coolest storylines to come from DVD comics and also to pump some needed energy into the Superman comic book series.The storyline featured the intergalactic serial killer known as Doomsday. With super strength, virtually indestructible and the embodiment of evil, not even the Justice League could defeat him. That was until the bloody battle between Superman and Doomsday came to a head and in the end, Doomsday was defeated but Superman sacrificed his life to protect Metropolis and paid for it with his life.With the release of the DVD of ""SUPERMAN DOOMSDAY"", the first animated Superman movie, is based on the popular battle.Although the storyline of the animated movie is not exactly the same as the comic book series, the animated film manages to capture the essence of Superman and the bloody battle.In this film, Superman and Lois Lane have been dating for six months. Lois wants to know more about Superman and she has a hunch that possibly he may be Clark Kent.While the two are having a romantic vacation, Lex Luthor is still scheming on how to beat Superman and his corporat Lex Corp finds what may be an alien vessel (which turns out to be an imprisonment for whatever is inside). Of course, Lex Luthor authorizes the research team to open the alien vessel and Doomsday is unleashed.Although the film focuses on the battle between Superman and Doomsday, the storyline goes in much deeper by focusing on the emotions of Lois Lane, Martha Kent and the people close to Superman post-death and that includes Lex Luthor who is so upset that he was not the person to stop Superman and feels cheated.But all of a sudden when Metropolis needs a hero, a man with the blue tights and red cape is back. But is it really Superman?So, the storyline is top notch and I wouldn't expect anything less from Bruce Timm, Lauren Montgomery and Brandon Vietti. Bruce Timm has worked on the awesome ""Justice League"" and ""Batman"" animated series and the storyline definitely delivers, thankfully to the cool screenplay by Duane Capizzi.I must admit that I was not liking Superman's character design, since I was used to the animated series version and got so used to the ""Justice League"" animated series and to see Superman have lines around the cheek bones and a John Travolta style chin...(fortunately, not too Jay Leno) took some time getting used to.As for the voice acting, Adam Baldwin did a great job as Superman and at first I was not too sure about Anne Heche's voice acting as Lois Lane. It was very different but as the film progressed, I got used to it and I admit, it was kind of unique for her character.As for special features, the DVD comes with 70 minutes of special features including the ""Documentary and Rebirth: Superman Lives!"" which is an informative and awesome look of how the comic book creators came up with the ""Death of Superman"" back in the early 90's. I was impressed that they actually had a lot of video footage from the planning stages to the promotion.  This feature alone is sure to be ""golden"" among Superman fans and readers who followed the ""Death of Superman"" series.Also featured is a commentary by Bruce Tim and Duane Cappizi, voice director Andrea Romano and executive producer Gregory Noveck.Also an exclusive sneak peak at DC Universe's ""Justice League: The New Frontier"", ""Behind the Voice"" featurette and ""Superman's Last Stand Challenge"".I purchased my DVD from Wal-Mart and that comes with a bonus CD which features the actual ""Death of Superman"" comic book.Although I tend to review mostly Japanese animation, when it comes to certain creators and people behind an animated series or film in the US, I have come to expect quality.For me, Bruce Timm brings quality to DC characters and ""SUPERMAN DOOMSDAY"" does not disappoint one bit, although loosely based on the comic series of the ""Death of Superman"", the storyline that they came up with for this animated film is still just as emotional and awesome as the storyline that ran in the comic books.I was among the comic book readers who highly anticipated the comic book release back in 1993, in fact, I bought 4 bagged and 4 regular, the collector's card series and collected the whole run.  That is how hardcore I was into the series.  I loved every issue and admit I was skeptical about the animated film, because I knew that there would be no Doomsday vs. the Justice League, nor will there be the funeral which featured nearly every major super hero from the DC universe, nor the four who tried to take on Superman's legacy.But I do trust Bruce Timm and he has not disappointed me once with the animated television series, so needless to say, after watching this DVD, I enjoyed every minute of it.It's interesting because Marvel has released several cool animated films within the past two years but DC's first animated film since the ""Batman"" animated film years ago, with ""SUPERMAN DOOMSDAY"", this release is a grand slam.Great storyline, awesome special features and featuring one of the most popular heroic icon in American culture, ""SUPERMAN DOOMSDAY"" is indeed a winner.

It is worth checking out for all Superman fans over 13.

There were also some adult themes going on between Supes and Lois, so don't let your young kids watch this. The stupid lines under Superman's eyes were dumb looking and very distracting.

1070071,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B000PE0G0A,E. David Swan,"[0, 0]","MAJOR SPOILERS INCLUDED:There were things done well in the original Death of Superman comic storyline and things done not so well. The Doomsday plot started off innocently enough but after a lengthy buildup exploded into a fevered climax. Doomsday's true form was only revealed after repeated encounters with Earths heroes shredded his suit and I liked the way he literally fought with one hand tied behind his back for much of the story. Doomsday's obliteration of Earths mightiest defenders gave him a tremendous amount of credibility leading up to his finale with Superman. By contrast the animation has no time for building suspense and so Doomsday quickly plows through the military before his inevitable collision with Superman. Rather than have the two combatants deliver simultaneous knockout blows Superman crushes Doomsday to the ground from outer space. Not something I would normally expect to kill Superman. By and large I was never a big fan of the death of Superman storyline and I didn't like that the big guy was taken down by a brand new villain who simply punched him to death. Unfortunately the parts that worked for me had to be removed for brevity's sake. The second half of the comic storyline was the resurrection of Superman but again for the sake of time they removed almost everything including the Cyborg Superman, The Eradicator and John Irons.The funny thing is that what works in the movie has nothing to do with Doomsday. A new Superman appears in Metropolis who looks and speaks like the original and everyone assumes he has risen from the dead. Instead, the new Superman is a clone created by Lex Luthor similar to the Kon-El storyline from the comics. The excitement of Superman's return is soon dampened after the Toyman kills a 4 year old girl and the clone decides to take care of him... permanently. Later, after the Man of Steel rescues a cat from a tree he gives its elderly owner a stern warning that every time he has to perform a small rescue it takes him away from larger emergencies. Superman's voice remains calm but his words contain a less than subtle threat and the old woman shrinks in fear. Soon all of Metropolis discovers that no one better get in Superman's way while he defends the city. For me this was by far the best part of the movie and played into a theme of freedom and security that was analyzed throughout season two of Justice League Unlimited. There is no indication that the clone sees himself as anything less than a hero which brings some unexpected depth to the character.Inevitably the true man of tomorrow returns having only been rendered comatose rather than actually killed. With long hair and a black and silver solar suit the real Superman faces off against the clone in a real barn burner. In fact both of the major battles are done well and the animation is well above what is seen in the animated series.The Doomsday movie exists in a different world than the animated series universe and the characters are given completely different looks and voices. I actually prefer this version of Luthor with a much sleeker appearance and less arrogant voice. Superman on the other hand looks a bit odd with deep creases on either side of his face, a large cleft chin and a neck that looks to be about 30 inches around. Even his costume doesn't look correct being very shiny almost as if it's made of rubber.The producers of the movie don't hold back on the deaths and Doomsday carves a swath of murder that sometimes borders on gratuitous. In this version Toyman (who looks nothing like the animated series version or any of the comic incarnations) is homicidal and as stated before gets offed by the clone. Even Luthor is more ruthless as he puts a bullet in his longtime assistant Mercy to keep anyone from discovering his link to Doomsday. The second part of the movie is in my opinion better than the first and I have to say that the movie as a whole felt like more than just an extended version of the animated series which differentiates it from the lamentable Brainiac Attacks. It's a superior product with better animation and a plot that is both deeper and more mature than the television show.",4,Better Than Expected,1247097600,"07 9, 2009",2009,4175,"['MAJOR', 'SPOILERS', 'INCLUDED', 'were', 'things', 'done', 'well', 'original', 'Death', 'Superman', 'comic', 'storyline', 'things', 'done', 'not', 'so', 'well', 'Doomsday', 'plot', 'started', 'off', 'innocently', 'enough', 'lengthy', 'buildup', 'exploded', 'fevered', 'climax', 'Doomsday', 'true', 'form', 'was', 'only', 'revealed', 'repeated', 'encounters', 'Earths', 'heroes', 'shredded', 'suit', 'liked', 'way', 'literally', 'fought', 'one', 'hand', 'tied', 'back', 'much', 'story', 'Doomsday', 'obliteration', 'Earths', 'mightiest', 'defenders', 'gave', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'credibility', 'leading', 'up', 'finale', 'Superman', 'contrast', 'animation', 'time', 'building', 'suspense', 'so', 'Doomsday', 'quickly', 'military', 'inevitable', 'collision', 'Superman', 'Rather', 'have', 'two', 'combatants', 'deliver', 'simultaneous', 'knockout', 'blows', 'Superman', 'crushes', 'Doomsday', 'ground', 'outer', 'space', 'Not', 'something', 'would', 'normally', 'expect', 'kill', 'Superman', 'large', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'fan', 'death', 'Superman', 'storyline', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'big', 'guy', 'was', 'taken', 'down', 'brand', 'new', 'villain', 'who', 'simply', 'punched', 'death', 'Unfortunately', 'parts', 'worked', 'had', 'be', 'removed', 'brevity', 'sake', 'second', 'half', 'comic', 'storyline', 'was', 'resurrection', 'Superman', 'again', 'sake', 'time', 'removed', 'almost', 'everything', 'including', 'Cyborg', 'Superman', 'Eradicator', 'John', 'Irons.The', 'funny', 'thing', 'what', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'Doomsday', 'new', 'Superman', 'Metropolis', 'who', 'original', 'everyone', 'risen', 'dead', 'Instead', 'new', 'Superman', 'clone', 'created', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'similar', 'Kon-El', 'storyline', 'comics', 'excitement', 'Superman', 'return', 'soon', 'dampened', 'Toyman', '4', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'clone', 'take', 'care', 'permanently', 'Later', 'Man', 'Steel', 'rescues', 'cat', 'tree', 'elderly', 'owner', 'stern', 'warning', 'time', 'perform', 'small', 'rescue', 'away', 'larger', 'emergencies', 'Superman', 'voice', 'calm', 'words', 'contain', 'less', 'subtle', 'threat', 'old', 'woman', 'fear', 'Soon', 'Metropolis', 'discovers', 'one', 'better', 'get', 'Superman', 'way', 'city', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'played', 'theme', 'freedom', 'security', 'was', 'analyzed', 'season', 'two', 'Justice', 'League', 'Unlimited', 'indication', 'clone', 'anything', 'less', 'hero', 'unexpected', 'depth', 'character.Inevitably', 'true', 'man', 'tomorrow', 'returns', 'having', 'only', 'been', 'rendered', 'comatose', 'rather', 'actually', 'killed', 'long', 'hair', 'black', 'silver', 'solar', 'suit', 'real', 'Superman', 'off', 'clone', 'real', 'barn', 'burner', 'fact', 'major', 'battles', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'animation', 'well', 'what', 'seen', 'animated', 'series.The', 'Doomsday', 'movie', 'different', 'world', 'animated', 'series', 'universe', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'completely', 'different', 'looks', 'voices', 'actually', 'prefer', 'version', 'Luthor', 'much', 'sleeker', 'appearance', 'less', 'arrogant', 'voice', 'Superman', 'other', 'hand', 'bit', 'odd', 'deep', 'creases', 'side', 'face', 'large', 'cleft', 'chin', 'neck', 'be', '30', 'inches', 'Even', 'costume', ""n't"", 'look', 'correct', 'being', 'very', 'shiny', 'almost', 'made', 'rubber.The', 'producers', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'deaths', 'Doomsday', 'swath', 'murder', 'borders', 'gratuitous', 'version', 'Toyman', 'who', 'nothing', 'animated', 'series', 'version', 'comic', 'incarnations', 'homicidal', 'as', 'stated', 'offed', 'clone', 'Even', 'Luthor', 'more', 'ruthless', 'bullet', 'longtime', 'assistant', 'Mercy', 'keep', 'anyone', 'discovering', 'link', 'Doomsday', 'second', 'part', 'movie', 'opinion', 'better', 'first', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'whole', 'felt', 'more', 'just', 'extended', 'version', 'animated', 'series', 'lamentable', 'Brainiac', 'Attacks', 'superior', 'product', 'better', 'animation', 'plot', 'deeper', 'more', 'mature', 'television', 'show']",Superman: Doomsday

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[10, 15]","Face facts, Super-fans: there is no way possible a film adaptation of the entire Superman/Doomsday saga could possibly have been attempted much less pleased everyone ... so we all may as well dispense with comparisons, per se, to the comics saga that took well over a year to tell AND to read.  It's nice to understand that SUPERMAN - DOOMSDAY had its basis on that stellar reality because, in the end, at least Bruce Timm and company knew which elements to keep and, arguably, which to shelve for some other project.That said, I heartily enjoyed SUPERMAN - DOOMSDAY as a passing interpretation of the 'Death of Superman' storyline.  On the commentary track, the creators and other 'creative' folk admit that there were painful choices that had to be made in fashioned this adaptation into a workable project, and I'd give 'em props for taking the seminal moment -- the best slugmatch in town, the one that results in two deaths -- and giving it serious screen time.  Once Supes and his ultimate foe, Doomsday, come together, the streets of Metropolis will never be the same.Largely, it's mostly Saturday morning animation here, despite what some of the more technically skilled folks will tell you.  Despite Timm and company's strong desire to distance themselves from THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN, the look is still largely the same.  Characters -- Lois, Jimmy, Mr. White -- are given greater re-invention than Supes -- who curiously has some jagged Clint Eastwood-esque cheekbones that look horribly out of place on his skin of steel.  It's a gripe.  It's a distraction.  Does it ruin the film?  No.  Does it separate it enough from THE ADV. OF SUPES?  Not really.Content-wise, there are a few surprising additions.  The violence is whacked up more than a few notches (parents note: it's rated PG-13 for good reasons), and Lex Luther is given one particularly gruesome scene (yes, it's the one involving a certain blonde) that took me by surprise.  Doomsday's 'birth' of sorts is also graphic but thankfully it's mostly washed over in darkness to spare the faint of heart.  The second half of the film -- it's what most strongly deviates from the 'Death of Supes' story -- is a bit of a letdown; very little is retained from the source material, but I didn't find it terribly disappointing ... on its own, SUPERMAN - DOOMSDAY had far more heart, drama, and relevance than did Bryan Singer's SUPERMAN RETURNS, if you ask me, a film that I found mostly dull, forced, and flat.On the MAJOR PLUS side, one of the Special Features is ""Requiem and Rebirth: Superman Lives!"" documentary, a terrific look back at the phenomenon that was the real 'Death' storyline, and that alone made this disc worth the price of admission.",4,DOOMed?

James is good as Lex Luthor but Clancy Brown is definitely better. Overall, I was fairly satisfied but I do agree that it could've been better.The extras were interesting.

I am a huge fan of the original Superfriends, and up until recently hadn't really heard much about the newer versions of the superheroes I grew up with.  But on one of the Superfriends DVDs, there was a preview for this movie - Superman: Doomsday - and I had to see what it was all about.  And after seeing it....I loved it.The story was action packed, suspenseful, and interesting.  It provided a whole new perspective to the Superman mythos - that of a dark society and a group of villains who were not hesitant to kill innocents.  The fact that this cartoon showed the degree of genuine violence it did shocked me a bit, but given the 'adult' nature of this cartoon, it was appropriate.  The re-imagining of many of the characters was great, and the way the movie ended was intriguing as well.  Overall, this was an enjoyable movie to watch, and it provided what I was looking for - namely, entertainment in the form of a new look to the Superman story.Would I have liked a bit more detail in some of the story elements?  Sure.  I would have liked to hear more background about Lex Luthor and his plot to genetically engineer a group of Supermen.  I would also have liked to learn more about how Superman is reincarnated.  There could have been more detailed story lines, and more character development.  But even without any of these things, the movie was still great.To those naysayers, I am sure that if you really compared this to the earlier comics and the overall story line of Superman, there may have been flaws.  But I would venture to say that the flaws in this updated version were no worse than the flaws in the 1970s and 1980s versions of the Superfriends.  So can't we just accept that this movie was entertainment and it achieved its goal?

Needless to say, the acting talent is top choice with many famous names thrown in (including a cameo by comic book fan Kevin Smith). I was expecting a very cut up storyline that wouldn't make sense since it is compressing so many comics into an hour and fifteen minute movie. I was wrong, the story flows a lot better than I would have expected it it doesn't lose the emotion.The Doomsday fight itself was cut shorter than what is shown in the comics, but it was still pretty powerful and I actually felt sad when the sad moments occured.

Of course, it didn't completely follow the original trilogy entitled Death of Superman, World Without a Superman, and Return of Superman.  If it had, the movie would have been at least three times longer than it was.  There was no Cyborg here or Super Boy or Steel.  Only the Eradicator was depicted by the ""bad"" Superman.  Bruce Timm and company took the famous story and included in their movie only what was really important to the story:  Doomsday kills Superman and Superman comes back to life, but not without some confusion to the people of Metropolis due to his evil double, who really isn't all that evil, just a little misguided.  If you call dropping the Toyman from 1,000 feet in the sky to his death misguided.  The Eradicator was my favorite Superman double in the stories, so I'm glad they he was the one they included in this movie.One point regarding the Superman/Clark animation is that he had a weird cheekbone thing going on that was kind of distracting at first, but it grew on me as the movie progressed.  A big missing factor for me was no Batman or any of the other Justice Leaguers.  In the books, it showed how Superman's death affected Batman and the other super heroes.  For me, that would have enhanced the movie, but I can see why they left it out, for the sake of the continuity of the story.All in all, it was a very good movie, just not as epic as the books were.

The whole rest of the story seemed to be taken in bits and pieces from the movies (mostly Superman Returns).  I found myself watching scenes and thinking ""Ah, I know that scene.  It's from Superman II."" and so on.  This movie has almost nothing in common with the comic or the book (The Death and Life of Superman) either.It wasn't really the complete deviation from the story that bugged me.  It was the little things that didn't need to be changed.  See below for examples.--Did the director or writer even read the comic?  Doesn't look like it.  Let's see--Lois is having an affair with Superman, but doesn't know that he's Clark Kent (she guesses, but he hasn't told her).  This would be from Superman Returns. In the comic (and book version), they're already engaged and the secret has already been told to Lois.--Only Martha Kent is shown.  We are to assume that Jonathon is dead?  This would be from Superman Returns again.--Jimmy Olsen quits the Daily Planet and goes to work for a tabloid?  What was the point of that, exactly?--Lex Luthor is shown to be a super genius (ex: he comes up with a cure for MS and has other diseases being worked on).  Evidently, they got him mixed up with Brainiac (hey, maybe they DID read a comic or two!)  And when did he start looking like an anorexic?  I won't even go into how different the comic Lex is from this version.  Would take way too long.  Let it suffice to say that they took the easy way out using a Lex that everyone was more or less familiar with already.I understand the shortcuts.  The whole 'real' story couldn't have been told in one DVD.  However, the things that were changed for no apparent good reason (those items listed above) were EXTREMELY annoying.If you don't know anything about the Superman universe, this is a pretty good movie.If you don't know much about Superman, rent this and see if you like it.  I don't see how any Superman fan could not walk away from this a bit irritated, though.As for the voices and characters:Anne Heche did a nice job as Lois.  She was shown as being uber-skinny, but that's a nitpick.  She seemed to be in character.Baldwin (Adam?) was okay.  Made Supes sound like he was half asleep, but it wasn't horrible.  He was drawn like a blockhead, but that's the way everyone wants to draw him nowadays.  Laugh if you want to, but the best cartoon version of Superman was on Superfriends.

1070089,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000PE0G0A,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 5]","Some nobody: ""Who's the man in black?""Perry White: ""Who cares? He's kicking Superman's a%%!""Back in the early '90s, the comic book industry got a massive shot in the arm with the Death of Superman, and it was an impressive undertaking indeed, involving the tight integration of the four Superman titles. And after Supes died saving the world from Doomsday, the stories got even better. DC unveiled the heartfelt Funeral for a Friend arc, followed by the mysterious fake Supermen, then the cherry on top, the ultimate return of the true Man of Steel. However, SUPERMAN: DOOMSDAY, DC's inaugural straight-to-dvd animated movie, takes drastic short cuts and liberties and in the end proves to be a head-shaking letdown.Understandably, this film, at a running time of 75 minutes, is unable to incorporate all the story arcs in the Death of Superman, World Without a Superman, and the Return of Superman volumes. So no room for the Eradicator, Superboy, Cyborg, or Steel. And certainly no room for Green Lantern's abrupt inclusion and the total devastation of Coast City. We do get the relentless and single-minded Doomsday, Lex Luthor, and Toyman for villains, and one other. But compared to the excitement, breadth and emotion of the comic books it shoddily adapted, this film is found decidedly wanting.I did find two things to take solace from. Item one: I tremendously enjoyed the two sprawling, epic, minutes-long Metropolis punchfests which bookmark the film, wherein Superman severely gets his caped arse handed to him. The second thing I liked, the hefty special features. We get an audio commentary worth listening to by the filmmakers (including Bruce Timm); the in-depth 43-minute-long ""Requiem and Rebirth: Superman Lives!"" featurette which covers the Death of Superman comic book phenomenon and offers interviews with the four main writers of that stretch (several of whom get teary-eyed on camera); a teaser of the very promising Justice League: New Frontier film, based on Darwyn Cooke's mini-series; Behind the Voice featurette (5 minutes); and the ""Superman's Last Stand"" game. I'm stoked on Justice League: New Frontier.No complaints with the animation on this film, or the pulverizing fight scenes, or the interpretation of Superman as a darker, more self-righteous, and vindictive hero. Those were the good points, and I even appreciated the more mature tone taken by this film. There are some serious moments of violence here, as perpetrated by Doomsday and a sterner Man of Steel. But the movie lost me in between the all-out brawls, because that's where the film really drags.I've always found Lex Luthor to be a boring villain. Sadly, there's heavy emphasis on him and his frustration of having his long-schemed revenge on Superman being now forever denied him. Thus, he indulges in lackey beatdowns and a mercy killing. It doesn't help that Luthor is voiced by James Marsters, whose peevish tones are definitely inferior to the majestic, mellifluous Clancy Brown. Then there's the dreary sub-plot of Jimmy Olsen taking a new job at a sleaze rag. Who cares? It must be noted, however, that there are touches of sincerity in Lois Lane and Martha Kent's grieving. Anne Heche as Lois seems okay, but, dang it, I'm just so used to Dana Delaney. I must say, though, that I'm perfectly fine with Adam Baldwin as Superman.SUPERMAN: DOOMSDAY was something I had to get, me being a fan of the Death of Superman stories. I'm not gonna say I regret having purchased this as I don't believe the film was a total loss. But, yes, it could've - should've - been much better. This is the first time Bruce Timm's disappointed me with his stuff. May it be the last.

1070096,A26O0T192IBKY1,B000PE0G0A,J. Alford,"[0, 0]","Starting off their ongoing series of made-for-video features for DC Universe, Warner Premiere decided to go with a darker chapter from the Man Of Steel's history that was mostly overlooked in any of his previous animated adaptations. Based on the Death Of Superman, Funeral For A Friend, and Reign Of The Supermen story arcs from the various comic books, this was directed by previous DC superhero animation writer Bruce Timm, along with Batman: The Animated Series writer Duane Capizzi. Even though it was done as its own movie, it shadows some story elements from Superman: The Animated Series.This takes place during a time when Lex Luthor is still in charge of Lexcorp, and Superman has recently been dating Lois, although he hasn't told her his secret identity yet, despite her suspicions. While digging underground for a new power source, Luthor's crew discovers an ancient spacepod housing a hulking alien monster. The creature(Doomsday)goes on a rampage through Metropolis, and Supes enages with him in a slugfest the likes of which Goku wouldn't have survived. Their clash knocks over building after building, which suprisingly no one was in at the time, but ultimately both the super-strong aliens die from the fight. Superman is buried in an elaborately huge memorial in the middle of Metropolis park, although apparently all the JLA members were too busy trying to get their own DC Universe movies made to bother to showing up at his funeral. Lois is bereaved, and goes to Martha Kent in Smallville for someone to talk to. Jimmy Olsen quits the Daily Planet to work for a tabloid rag, and Perry White give in to whisky. Villains on the other hand have been having a crime orgy in Metropolis, and staple crazy genius Toyman kidnaps a bus full of kids. Fortunately, they are rescued by a supposedly resurrected Superman! This revived Man of Tomorrow is really a clone created by Luthor, who now holds the corpse of the original in Lexcorp. However, Superman's faithful robot manages to get it back with no detection, and brings him back to the Fortress of Solitude where its revealed that Superman wasn't really dead at all, but in a biological stasis. He is revived, only to find out that his evil twin has killed Toyman, and just taken out Luthor, along with all the other soulless Superman clones. Even though he's only at partial power, Superman puts on a solar-collecting gothic jumpsuit along with a kryptonite gun, and flies to confront Superman-B. The two of them butt heads, wrecking a good part of the freshly-regenerated city with them. Superman-A takes out Superman-B with some leftover Krytonite dust, and everyone welcomes the ""real"" Superman back(despite the fact that he just freakin' killed a guy!).This story is something that's been adapted several times since its comic book run. In a radio drama, a novelization, and a killer video game. Although like most of them, the movie takes and leaves alot of material not used in the original. This includes Luthor's whole rebirth thing where he actually has a full head of hair, no Supergirl, and pretty much none of the actual four Supermen who showed up after Super died. The evil clone is sorta based on the idea of the Superboy clone, but gone all bent after being abused by Luthor. Also, Lois was already married to Clark and knew his secret identity prior to Doomsday ruining their honeymoon. In most of the original DC animated continuity, Doomsday only fought the actual Superman once and got his ass kicked, but this movie managed to pull off a real all-out bout to end the doubt. The rest of the story after Superman kicks the bucket is fair, at least with everyone grieving over the loss, plus Luthor totally loosing it by beating the crap out his clone with Kryptonite gloves because he didn't get the chance to kill Supes himself.

True the movie does stray a little from the original comics, but it stays close enough that you still get the idea.  This movie does not take place in Warner Brother's ""Superman - The Animated Series"" universe.  There's no JLA, & Lex Luthor is a much more brutal, sinister Luthor.  This Luthor is very familiar to those familiar with the comics.  He's a take no prisoners killer.  I also like what they did with ""The Toyman"" (it's to bad he won't be around for future pics :P).  This is a PG-13 movie that deserves to be PG-13 (unlike Marvel's pathetic attempts at making animated feature films ""Ultimates/Iron Man/Doctor Strange"" YUK!), the fight scenes are brutal & you really get a sense of the power being thrown around between both Superman & Doomsday.  This is the film Warner should've made with the recent ""Superman Returns"", live action this would've been awesome.  There's a whole new voice cast that for this film that nail the characters dead on.  The animation (again unlike the Marvel animation) is truely amazing you can tell the animators really put their hearts & souls into every frame.  The return/rebirth of Superman storyline is a little different.  Rather than their being 4 Supermen taking his place their is only one.  I won't go to deep into detail as not to spoil anything for anyone, but it fits well with the story.  4 Supermen wouldn't have fit into one film & for thsi I'm glad they chose to change things rather than force it into a 90 minute movie.  The special features are great too, you get an interview with the entire team that originally killed Superman with the Doomsday story line which is really cool (just think we have ""Lois & Clark"" to thank for ""Supes"" demise:P), cast interviews & a sneak peek inside look at Warners next DC animnated film ""Justice League - The New Frontier"" which looks just as equally amazing!!  Anyway, those are my thoughts.  Anyone who's ever liked Superman needs to watch this movie.  That goes for anyone who's ever enjoyed animated films as well.

I don't fantasize about the fall of child hood demigods. I for one thought Michael Jackson's brain would be kept alive in a lab until the year 20 blot - Zero and I took no pleasure when the Crocodile Hunter met his demise by stinger and not by a pair of gigantic crushing jaws. So, neither was I wanting Super Man to die at the hands of an INTER GALACTIC SOCCER HOOLIGAN!However, if it HAD to happen, I'm sure select fans had their blood lust satiated by the comics and movie; It was at least done elegantly and thoughtfully...in a way that did not gross out the fans who never wanted this, but were drawn because this is a milestone in Super Man's history.I thought it was very well set up from the beginning as we were reminded of Superman's quirks by visiting the Crystal Fortress and reminded of his Earth ties by being reintroduced to Jimmy, Martha, and Lois. I especially like Martha...she is played for very dry humor here and it works.And who's death isn't ten times more heart breaking when their mother and girlfriend have to watch it on TV? Heck, Lois was there (sniffle) - talk about dark and it goes on to be even darker as we see Lex's shocking reaction to the death of his long time rival. I won't spoil it, but I was appalled. I never would have put Lex in the same twisted and demented category as I do the Bat Man villains, but Lex earns his place there this time. He's a sick man.Well, things snowball out of control and then get crazier from there. By the third act of this movie, I was questioning the Super Man mythos as I know it, which it is very rare that a Holly Wood production of a character can pull that off, let alone an animated production.They wrapped it up neatly near the end, but I was still left wondering that if these things can happen....nothing will ever be the same in this/that/whichever world. I might also add that if you've ever wondered what a Super Man played by Jeff Goldblum circa 80's glam rocker version would be like, there is one flying around here that just tickled me pink.

He starts causing havoc everywhere and he's so strong that Superman can barely take him. Also Lois is with Superman but he still won't even admit to her that he's Clark Kent as well eventhough she finds it pretty obvious.Superman has a brutal fight with Doomsday and neither survive. This leaves mankind with no protector. That is until Superman suddenly returns but this Superman handles the law with violence. Which leads Lois and Martha Kent to thinking he's really not Superman. Lex Luther cloned him out of madness since he is very disapointed that it wasn't him who killed Superman. But is the real Superman really dead and will he return to save mankind from the evil Superman ?The movie is surprisingly dark and violent and even has some vulgarity so parents might want to consider if they let their kids watch it or not. It's well made though and is easily superior to any of Marvel's made for video Ultimate Avengers movies. It's better done than Superman Returns and thank god he has no kid here. I also liked the voice acting of Adam Baldwin (Serenity) as Superman, Anne Heche (Psycho...the remake) as Lois Lane and James Marsters (Spike in Buffy and Brainiac in Smallville) as Lex Luther.

In a way it's sort of like the ""Classic Ilustrated"" version- There is Superman, and there is Doomsday and they do fight and Superman is killed and he does return. This DVD diverges greatly from the Comic story, but if you are open to accepting it for what it is - you might like it. I bought it hoping to see an animated representation of the comic book. Sure, I've played the story in my head a hundred times - in my imagination I've heard the sound of the clash between the man of Steel and Doomsday. In my imagination I've felt the earth shake as buildings fell - I wanted to see it in animation.  That was there in this DVD, but there were no Justice League members helping out and no reign of the Supermen.  There were some twists thrown in the were never in the comics.  At first I was a little disappointed - then I simply settled in to watch it for what it was - and it WAS something I liked - but it was in many ways the ""classic illustrated"" version of a much greater story. You can read the ""classics illustrated"" version of ""White Fang"" and get the gist of the story, but the actual book beats the CI version any day. The actual comic depiction is much better than this DVD, but this DVD was enjoyable to me for exactly what it was - a chance to watch Doomsday come to life and slug it out with the man of Steel.

1070119,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B000PE0G0A,Jonathan Appleseed,"[9, 19]","This film was a colossal disappointment. I found the animation uncomfortable and difficult to watch, although this is my own personal preference - I don't care for the way this particular Superman, and all the people, are drawn. They appear to be an amalgamation of building, or cinder blocks. It's just not attractive. Louis is so angular she barely possesses any humanity. There isn't any spark or interest between her and Superman; and in a Superman film, be it animation or live action, there absolutely has to be a spark between Lois and Clark/Superman. Superman is already at a disadvantage as a character, because he's so darn powerful, and his morals and integrity are unquestionable. He's the perfect guy. That's why it's difficult to tell stories about him, as opposed to Batman, for whom telling stories isn't as difficult. He's fallible - physically and morally. Superman has two essential weaknesses: Kryptonite and Lois. How many does Batman have? Ask any writer who they'd rather write stories for, and 9 times out of ten you're going to hear ""Batman"".Why this particular Superman ""realization"" was chosen for this film is anyone's guess. If it was in the special features, I missed it. The special features weren't subtitled, and as I'm hearing impaired, I don't bother with special features that aren't subtitled. (Really - how much money are we talking about to add subtitles or captions to special features?)But my disappointment goes far beyond the animation, and is more solidly found in the story itself. The death of Superman, and his return, as told in the actual comic books, were incredible stories by themselves. The only editing required would have been to cut scenes. It wasn't necessary to bring Lex Luthor in and rewrite 90% of the story, especially when the story they came up with was so insipid. My best guess for the inclusion of Luthor was mass appeal. More people know who Luthor is than Doomsday, so perhaps they were banking on Luthor's involvement raising the stakes for those who might not have read the initial series. Again, though, why do *anything* if what your doing detracts from the story? The story is about Superman, Doomsday, and Superman's return. They should have stuck to their original story. They didn't need Supergirl or the Justice League (part of the story 14 years ago). Those scenes could have been cut, and still given them plenty to work with.The actual fight between Superman and Doomsday was remarkably dull, and mostly because they cut Superman's thoughts out. In the comic strip, Superman was shown thinking about how devastating Doomsday was, and how much he, Superman, was hurting. To show how badly Superman is being hurt, especially through his own thoughts (it's more specific that way than a simple ""OOMF"", or a facial expression of pain) would have added very necessary drama to the scene in the film.I followed this series week-by-week as it was released in the early 90s. The creators had to find a creature capable of killing Superman (without resorting to a tired Kryptonite-based plot), and they brilliantly invented the character of Doomsday, who was fleshed out even more in a later graphic novel (Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey). It still ranks as one of the more exciting reads that I can recall, and I'm not necessarily a comic book fan.When I first read the comic book that killed Superman, I admit to being choked up when he died. The writers did such a terrific job at building the scene and setting the necessary emotions, I doubt I could have done anything but be choked up. When Superman died in this animated film, I felt like yawning. And it was pretty much the same for when he came back.About coming back: he came back to fight a genetically engineered Superman (being controlled, partially at least, by Luthor), and came back in a black suit with solar panels to increase his absorption of the yellow sun. Did anyone else notice that the fight between Superman and his clone occurred at night? The least they could have done is waited until the sun rose.Bottom line: if you read the comic and enjoyed it, you should watch this. If you didn't read the comic, but want to see the character that killed Superman, I would recommend buying thisThe Death of Supermanand avoiding the film altogether.

Menta, Jr.","[0, 1]","Not earth-shattering perhaps, but nonetheless a pretty good adaptation/distillation of the ""Death of Superman"" comic book storyline of the early 90's.  This one-shot animated film can't possibly have the impact of the original storyline, where Superman was actually assumed dead for several months before DC Comics finally brought him back, but it still nicely dramatizes the amazing notion of someone/something actually being able to kill the Man of Steel.While there's lots of action, I particularly liked that the script didn't overdose viewers on endless bombastic action just because it's more affordable to do huge action sequences in an animated film than in a live-action one.  This one gives us action when it's required, but also equally concentrates on good character interaction, well-done quiet moments, and unfolding its story in an effective, dramatic fashion.  A lot of the Marvel direct-to-DVD animated films can learn from the approach employed here; those Marvel animated films tend to start out well but then get engulfed in endless explosions and chaos that have little to do with the characters those movies are supposed to be about.A minor warning, though: continuity fans will just have to take a chill pill and sit back and enjoy the story at hand and not be bothered by the fact that it doesn't tie in with any other recent animated versions of the Man of Steel, Doomsday, Lex Luthor, Lois Lane, etc.  It's just meant to be a stand-alone adaptation of a popular comic book storyline.Generous extra features, including an entertaining commentary track by the film's creative forces, add extra value to this DVD, which was already well worth purchasing for the solid movie alone.",4,Nicely balances big battle scenes and small character moments,1201824000,"02 1, 2008",2008,1703,"['Not', 'earth-shattering', 'perhaps', 'nonetheless', 'pretty', 'good', 'adaptation/distillation', 'Death', 'Superman', 'comic', 'book', 'storyline', 'early', '90', 'one-shot', 'animated', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'have', 'impact', 'original', 'storyline', 'where', 'Superman', 'was', 'actually', 'assumed', 'dead', 'several', 'months', 'DC', 'Comics', 'finally', 'brought', 'back', 'still', 'nicely', 'amazing', 'notion', 'someone/something', 'actually', 'being', 'able', 'kill', 'Man', 'Steel.While', 'lots', 'action', 'particularly', 'liked', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'overdose', 'viewers', 'endless', 'bombastic', 'action', 'just', 'more', 'affordable', 'do', 'huge', 'action', 'sequences', 'animated', 'film', 'live-action', 'one', 'one', 'action', 'when', 'required', 'also', 'equally', 'good', 'character', 'interaction', 'well-done', 'quiet', 'moments', 'unfolding', 'story', 'effective', 'dramatic', 'fashion', 'lot', 'Marvel', 'direct-to-DVD', 'animated', 'films', 'can', 'learn', 'approach', 'employed', 'here', 'Marvel', 'animated', 'films', 'tend', 'start', 'out', 'well', 'then', 'get', 'engulfed', 'endless', 'explosions', 'chaos', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'characters', 'movies', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'about.A', 'minor', 'warning', 'continuity', 'fans', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'take', 'chill', 'pill', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'story', 'hand', 'not', 'be', 'bothered', 'fact', ""n't"", 'tie', 'other', 'recent', 'animated', 'versions', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Doomsday', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'etc', 'just', 'meant', 'be', 'stand-alone', 'adaptation', 'popular', 'comic', 'book', 'storyline.Generous', 'extra', 'features', 'including', 'entertaining', 'commentary', 'track', 'film', 'creative', 'forces', 'add', 'extra', 'value', 'DVD', 'was', 'already', 'well', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'solid', 'movie', 'alone']",Superman: Doomsday

Think of those animals on the Discovery channel that kill for no real reason, just to do it.  I didn't think that what Supes did to Doomsday would really hurt him and even before that, I thought he'd just throw him into the sun.

1070131,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000PE0G0A,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 1]","In 1992, one of the biggest events in comics' history was taking place over the course of multiple issues of DC Comics' long-running 'Superman' titles. That event would be the landmark 'Death of Superman' storyline. That storyline followed by the 'World Without a Superman' and 'Return of Superman' storylines contain some of the best moments in the Man of Steel's enduring career (in my opinion), and to this day rank amongst some of my most favorite comic book stories ever written. Fans of the comics, myself included, have often wondered and even hoped that one day a movie would be made chronicling this story, but realistically I knew it would never happen, not in live action anyway. Too much money, much too massive of a storyline, and the studios didn't appear to be all that interested. However, after the massive successes of ""Batman: The Animated Series"" and ""Superman: The Animated Series"" followed by ""Justice League"", animator/director Bruce Timm was given the go-ahead by Warner Brothers to begin work on an adaptation of this very storyline to be told in the form of animation. A medium that is perfectly suited for just this type of epic story. And with Bruce Timm at the helm, I figured that this particular property was in really good hands.""Superman: Doomsday"" is a loose adaptation of the epic storyline chronicling Superman's death and resurrection. When Lexcorp accidentally unearths a spaceship, they unknowingly cause the release of a merciless killer monster. As the monster known as Doomsday cuts a massive swath of damage, only one man appears capable of stopping such an evil force of nature. And so, Superman (Adam Baldwin) flies head-on into battle against the creature, matching him blow for blow, neither combatant seeming to have an advantage over the other. As the battle wears on Superman makes one final, last-ditch attempt to stop Doomsday, but sadly in order to stop him, Superman sacrificed himself in the process as well. While the world mourns the loss of it's greatest hero, everything seems so bleak and the world needs a hero. When suddenly it appears that Superman may not be dead after all. As a man who appears to be Superman begins saving the citizens of Metropolis once more, people are both excited to see their hero alive, but curious how it's possible. However, as Superman begins to act much colder than he used to, showing no mercy at times to criminals, the citizen's of Metropolis wonder if maybe this 'Superman' may not actually be the real deal. To complicate matters even further another Superman appears, this one in a black suit, claiming to be the true Man of Steel. But which hero is the true one?After achieving so much success with DC's many characters in animated form, would Bruce Timm's apparent golden touch work on the Man of Steel's best-selling graphic novel? The answer would be a resounding, 'Yes', and with flying colors, too. Bruce Timm's work here is among his finest, the animation is crisp (as we've come to expect from his work), the story is well-paced with plenty of action and drama, and the voice actors he gathered together are excellent as always.I had rather high expectations with this particular movie, not just because I knew the talent behind the movie was exceptional, but also because this is such a beloved character and story arc that you want it to be done faithfully. Now, I know that this movie differs from the overall storyline from the comics, but as the creative team had pointed out there's not near enough time in a 75 minute movie to tell the amount of story contained in the Death and Return of Superman storyline. So of course some trimming was going to be required, and I wasn't at all disappointed by the results. I thought the creative license that was taken was appropriate, I mean sure one does miss the chance to see the Cyborg Superman, the Eradicator, and Superboy, even Steel on some minor level. But you have to realize there was no way to show all of that unless you spread the story out over multiple movies (which would have been great). In place of them Bruce and his team have rolled up all of those characters into one specific character in the movie, so on some level you do get a slight hint of each of those pretenders to the throne.The actors that were chosen to bring their animated counterparts to life were all ones that had not previously been associated with any of the series' that Bruce Timm and his team had worked on over the years. A move that I somewhat liked, but also was a little frustrated with. I understood that the intention is to make these animated movies that Warner Brothers is producing be separate entities from the previous animated series', but I would have liked hearing Tim Daly or George Newbern voicing Superman (""Superman: The Animated Series"" and ""Justice League"" respectively) or even Clancy Brown as Lex Luthor again. Even without those actors, the cast for this movie was spot-on. I thought that Adam Baldwin did a terrific job of voicing Superman, and made it a point to provide different vocal inflections to signal the difference between Superman and the pretender. Anne Heche, though not my first choice for Lois Lane, actually did a really good job, and a couple of parts I actually really felt for her even though it was a cartoon. The remainder of the supporting cast were all equally strong in their performances, and each character was brought to life in very vivid ways that furhter enhanced the enjoyment I had for this movie. The quality of the voice acting, as it did during the various series', continues to serve as a testament to the terrific voice direction from Andrea Romano (long-time collaborator on the various animated series').If there's one thing that can be said for Bruce Timm and company, is that they definitely know their heroes, and how to produce high-quality projects that allow them to resonate with the widest audience, from the hard core fans to the average viewer, there's a little something for everyone in each of their properties. From long-running animated series' to feature films, the future definitely seems bright for DC Comics' characters. In regards to this new batch of animated films that Warner Brothers and DC Comics are working on, ""Superman: Doomsday"" is definitely an incredible start, and sets the bar rather high for the films that will follow.""Superman: Doomsday"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and minor sensuality.",5,The Ultimate Battle for the Man of Steel...,1192752000,"10 19, 2007",2007,6445,"['1992', 'one',

1070132,A2X7NBUETXC19E,B000PE0G0A,Justin G.,"[2, 2]","I'm not a huge Superman fan by any means, but I loved the Superman Animated series and was looking forward to the Superman: Doomsday movie, even though I knew it technically wasn't part of the same continuity.I know a lot of people seem to hate the fact that this movie is not a panel-by-panel adaptation of the Death and Return of Superman comics, but that may be for the best. The Return of Superman storyline got a bit convoluted, and this adaptation does a great job of streamlining things for casual fans. The return of ""Superman"" was presented quite differently, and I think this was an improvement over the original stories.The highlight of the movie was the fighting. The Superman/Doomsday battle was flat out epic, and was choreographed brilliantly. It was highly reminiscent of Japanese anime fighting, and the devastation was incredible. The Superman/Superman battle was almost as impressive, but ""bad"" Superman lacked Doomsday's menace. The only wonder is how there were any buildings in Metropolis left standing. I also loved the fact that Lex Luthor and the Toyman were far more sinister than before. The Toyman in particular was downright creepy.The absence of other superheroes both during the fight and at the funeral was decidedly unusual, especially given the sheer volume of DCU characters that rotate in and out of the Justice League series, but then again, none of the live action Superman movies had any guest stars (Richard Pryor doesn't count).I should also mention the fact that this is rated PG-13. The fighting is intense, there's a fair amount of blood spilling and neck snapping, and there's some scattered profanity as well. I'd recommend parents watch it before exposing it to kids. I don't understand the outrage from parents who couldn't be bothered to look at the rating and explanation on the back of the box before popping this into little Billy's DVD player.Overall I was very impressed with Superman: Doomsday. It was a solid adaptation of the original story, but was still accessible to non comic book fans, and is a worthy addition to the DCU animated movie library.",4,Impressive adaptation with some AMAZING fights,1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,2107,"[""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'Superman', 'fan', 'means', 'loved', 'Superman', 'Animated', 'series', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'movie', 'even', 'knew', 'technically', 'was', ""n't"", 'part', 'same', 'continuity.I', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'seem', 'hate', 'fact', 'movie', 'not', 'panel-by-panel', 'adaptation', 'Death', 'Return', 'Superman', 'comics', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'Return', 'Superman', 'storyline', 'got', 'bit', 'convoluted', 'adaptation', 'great', 'job', 'streamlining', 'things', 'casual', 'fans', 'return', 'Superman', 'was', 'presented', 'quite', 'differently', 'think', 'was', 'improvement', 'original', 'stories.The', 'highlight', 'movie', 'was', 'fighting', 'Superman/Doomsday', 'battle', 'was', 'flat', 'epic', 'was', 'choreographed', 'brilliantly', 'was', 'highly', 'reminiscent', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'fighting', 'devastation', 'was', 'incredible', 'Superman/Superman', 'battle', 'was', 'almost', 'impressive', 'bad', 'Superman', 'lacked', 'Doomsday', 'menace', 'only', 'wonder', 'how', 'were', 'buildings', 'Metropolis', 'left', 'standing', 'also', 'loved', 'fact', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Toyman', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'sinister', 'before', 'Toyman', 'particular', 'was', 'downright', 'creepy.The', 'absence', 'other', 'superheroes', 'fight', 'funeral', 'was', 'decidedly', 'unusual', 'especially', 'given', 'sheer', 'volume', 'DCU', 'characters', 'rotate', 'Justice', 'League', 'series', 'then', 'again', 'none', 'live', 'action', 'Superman', 'movies', 'had', 'guest', 'stars', 'Richard', 'Pryor', ""n't"", 'count', '.I', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'fact', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'fighting', 'intense', 'fair', 'amount', 'blood', 'spilling', 'neck', 'snapping', 'scattered', 'profanity', 'as', 'well', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'parents', 'watch', 'exposing', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'outrage', 'parents', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'look', 'rating', 'explanation', 'back', 'box', 'popping', 'little', 'Billy', 'DVD', 'player.Overall', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'was', 'solid', 'adaptation', 'original', 'story', 'was', 'still', 'accessible', 'non', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'worthy', 'addition', 'DCU', 'animated', 'movie', 'library']",Superman: Doomsday

Now, if it had gone to theaters, I'd say that was another story. That would put it under closer scrutiny. But here some people were really unfair. Just read some of these reveiws!Of course it's true that Superman:Doomsday isn't perfect; no movie can satisfy everyone. It does take a pretty blunt view of death and probably shouldn't be watched by little kids (I'd recommendSuperman: Brainiac Attacks - (Original Movie)for them instead), but there is actually very little blood.For those remembering the original story from DC Comics, you should be warned that this animated film understandably doesn't quite have the scope of the original graphic tale. It veers drastically as far as essential characters and continuity go, but overall it is complete in itself and well put together.And, besides, I liked the ending.

1070140,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B000PE0G0A,K. Ostrowski,"[3, 7]","Man, I hate movies based on things.  It's not that all of them are bad.  Batman Begins, for example, managed to be one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life, and about half of the recent superhero movies released to theaters have surprising been worth a single viewing.  No, I hate movies based on things because there are so many pitfalls for amateur directors, producers and actors to plummet, screaming into as the critics stand calmly above the pit's second level, hurling insults down upon them for their disrespect.  The worst part is that the more popular the subject matter is, the harder it is to appease the fans, half of whom will demand precise, unwavering faithfulness to all that's come before, as the other half whines that the story wasn't more original.  It's little wonder, therefore, that most directors and writers for movies based on other things just won't even bother trying to appease the fan base, and instead, will try to tell a story of their own with someone else's characters, thus effectively digging even larger and more scream-worthy pits for themselves to fall into when they really, really, REALLY get it wrong.So anyway.  Superman Doomsday.Here we have a movie that's about, or rather based on...  Alright.  It's very, very, very loosely based on a series of comics books that I think were first released sometime in the ninties, though I honestly can't remember a thing about comic books from the ninties.  Anyway, as my loyal contacts over at wikipedia have been kind enough to inform me, the death and return of Superman was a pretty big event, in which one character; creatively named Doomsday, decides it's a smart idea to go to town and start wrecking up the place.  Action and mayhem follow, and there's a whole mess in which a bunch of new superman-style superheroes appear before being quickly voted off the island when the old Superman returns.  Apparently, Superman Doomsday was intended to be something like that, but whether the old comics were fun to read or not, this film seems to have gotten a bit lost on the way to funsville.I think I may have been a bit spoiled by the art and storytelling style of the DC-animated universe, but I still don't see why Superman has to have stupid little black lines on his cheeks in every single scene like he's wearing really insufficient war-paint.  It's bad enough they had to dip Lois Lane in chocolate and force Lex Luthor to lose about fifty pounds, but if I were Mister Generic Doom Monster Guy fighting big blue, and I saw those little black ""Y's"" staring me in the face from either side of the big guy's mug, I'd probably bust a gut, which might make them functional at least.But how did the movie sound, you might ask?  Was the music any good?  How about the voices?  To that, I'd probably reply, ""Oh, I don't know.  Okay, I guess.""  That, of course, being me-speak for ""It couldn't have been anything really good, or I'd remember it, wouldn't I?""I hate it when people do this.  I don't know who got it into his head first that background music should never distract from the action in the movie.  It's background music.  It's supposed to seize you by the shirt collar and tell you how to feel in any given scene, just like it's done in all the good movies ever released; Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Hook, Spider-man, the first Superman movie with Christopher Reeves...  Bland, uninteresting, generic tunes like the kinds in this movie only serve to further outline how bland, uninteresting and generic the scenes themselves are, and once you realize that, there's not much else I need to say, is there?The story...  Let's see.  I guess there was probably a story, that...  Oh, yeah.  It started out with Mister Stone Cold Generic breaking loose from some evil monster container somewhere and going after Superman, so they at least got that part right, or at least, as right as you can get a really vague, underdeveloped story concept.  Then, for some reason, the movie decides that it wants Lex Luthor to be responsible for all the evil in the world, so he repeatedly unleashes and/or creates every other major threat in the entire movie, apparently not having learned his lesson from the first time.There's a couple of brief cartoon fight scenes, some equally-generic plot about a robot Superman, then a clone or some such thing that wants to follow the typical ""protect people by enslaving them with lethal force"" villain motivation textbook, but by that point, I'd stopped caring, and the movie clearly wanted me to care, because so many of the characters seemed to do so directly and loudly.Subplots are even worse, especially when Jimmy Olsen tries to go punky and rebellious and ends up sliding halfway into disco territory.  It's a seventy-four minute movie, for goodness' sake.  Do we really have time to worry about who Jimmy Olsen is working for this week?After that, we march, grudgingly, on to the final point on which the movie tripped and feel on its face; the relationship between Superman and Lois Lane.I have a confession to make.  I hated Superman II.  No, I'm not cowardly.  I'm not one of those people who quivers in fear when Kryptonian criminals invade Earth and take over.  What inspired so much loathing in me were the implications that Superman had allegedly gotten his thing down with Lois without any kind of formal commitment, and this movie is no different in that respect.I know that in the modern world, you'll be strung up by your bright red underwear for even implying that people should start taking a little responsibility and treating each other right, but are fidelity and honor really such hard things for people to grasp?  Is it so hard to imagine that a blue, alien boy scout who grew up in Kansas would naturally want to be honorable and commit to the person that he probably cares about most in the world well before scurrying under the sheets?  If that's really so hard to fathom, what does that say about our hero?  More importantly, what does it say about the hero concept in general, if we refuse to even conceive of a hero who's smart enough to attach some importance to any part of the mating process?To say that I found this movie disappointing would be an understatement the size of planet Krypton in its heyday, but maybe I shouldn't be all that surprised.  After releasing so much empty, meaningless crap like that ""the Batman"" animated series, it feels to me like the age of halfway decent DC Comics animation is well over.  If you really must see Superman animated on DVD, there's always the Paul Dini and Bruce Timm animated series, or even the Max and Dave Fleischer cartoons, which; short and minimalistic though they were, were still better and more faithful to the character than this piece of garbage.So to sum it up, animation; ridiculous and silly.  Sound, meh.  The story is a hopeless, irredeemable mess so mired in nothing's-sacred modernism that it's a wonder Superman can uphold justice at all, and from start to finish, I can't think of anything about this film that might possibly save it from being a overall bad experience, unless you're the kind that likes watching while moviemakers plummet into bottomless pitfalls.",1,Superman; Generic Evil

That is quite correct & is aimed at the higher age bracket &deserves; the MPAA rating of PG-13! Touted to be the first animated PG-13 Superman adventure & deservingly it should be! This was a violent & graphic storyline when it was initially published. I should know since I have the entire run of that storyline, Doomsday, The Death of Superman, Funeral For A Friend & then ultimately, The Reign of the Supermen! Great gripping reading & the artwork fantastic & graphic! Definitely not for young children!This dvd is a condensed version of the above-mentioned story arcs with the ultimate return of the Man of Steel!I will say that I sorely  diappointed with the runtime & abbreviated connected storylines to this great DC Comics event, which took it's place in the Media when it was announced to the world with a banner healine ""Superman Is Dead""! Did that get coverage not since the JFK assassination according to many persons.So due to the fact of the abbreviated storyline, which causes it to lose one star, the violence & some adult content, I will recommend it to teenagers & adults & not for young children!

Williams ""zerokoolkw""","[3, 5]","I hate to begin this review on a negative note but I have to say something to all the comic purists out there tearing down this movie....CAN IT!! Just about every review I read about this latest Timm-verse installment harps on the differences between this movie and the original comic. First of all, comic characters and their stories are always being re-invented in movies, tv shows and YES even the comics themselves. If Superman himself was still the man he was in 1938 I doubt anyone would be buying his books much less an animated dvd. My second point is that for those of you that are actually fans of Bruce Timm's previous work, THIS IS NOTHING NEW!! Timm has been putting his own spin (as well as the spin of many others) on Batman, Superman and the JLA since the early 90s!! Just about every villan and storyline from the Joker to Lex Luthor to Doomsday has been re-imagined in his shows and movies. Now for those of you who still want to cling to the details of this DVD I beg you to listen to the DVD commentary provided where Timm directly addresses why certain changes were made to the storyline and the characters. Finally, even if you couldn't stand the film itself this DVD is worth the 12-15 bucks just for the documentary about the original Death of Superman comic.",4,Purists back off...Bruce Timm does it again!!,1190419200,"09 22, 2007",2007,1283,"['hate', 'begin', 'review', 'negative', 'note', 'have', 'say', 'something', 'comic', 'purists', 'there', 'tearing', 'down', 'movie', 'IT', 'Just', 'review', 'read', 'latest', 'Timm-verse', 'installment', 'harps', 'differences', 'movie', 'original', 'comic', 'First', 'comic', 'characters', 'stories', 'are', 'always', 'being', 're-invented', 'movies', 'tv', 'shows', 'YES', 'even', 'comics', 'Superman', 'was', 'still', 'man', 'was', '1938', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'would', 'be', 'buying', 'books', 'much', 'less', 'animated', 'dvd', 'second', 'point', 'are', 'actually', 'fans', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'previous', 'work', 'THIS', 'NOTHING', 'NEW', 'Timm', 'been', 'putting', 'own', 'spin', 'as', 'well', 'spin', 'many', 'others', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'JLA', 'early', '90s', 'Just', 'villan', 'storyline', 'Joker', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Doomsday', 'been', 're-imagined', 'shows', 'movies', 'Now', 'who', 'still', 'want', 'cling', 'details', 'DVD', 'beg', 'listen', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'provided', 'where', 'Timm', 'directly', 'why', 'certain', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'storyline', 'characters', 'Finally', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'film', 'DVD', '12-15', 'bucks', 'just', 'documentary', 'original', 'Death', 'Superman', 'comic']",Superman: Doomsday

I'm a huge fan of the Superman Animated Series so I had really high hopes for this but there were too many problems which annoyed me to the point where I almost stopped watching.First, the voices do not match the characters at all. Superman and Lois sound completely off and lack the punch and energy of the TV series. Anne Heche (who does Lois) is horrible and made Lois sound like she was 50-60 years old. They made Lois look younger but made her sound older? Superman himself also lacks the gravitas and emotion from the TV series. The voice actor sounded like he was asleep at the wheel. I was also disappointed with everyone else as well. Almost everyone was miscast and their performances were terrible. What happened?The story also felt rushed. The twist in the middle is just lame and considering the title of the movie is Doomsday, I was disappointed that he was dropped so quickly. Why didn't the writers simply follow the story in the comics? They added some really lame plot devices which also felt undeveloped. They even managed to make Lex Luthor uncool! Wow...So what's good? The animation for the fights are spectacular. It's pretty much the only reason to watch this movie. It's great to see Superman fight two really strong opponents in full force. The animation is silky smooth with great choreography. I also liked that the villains actually killed people. That's something that made the movie's villains more dangerous which was refreshing.But overall, Superman Doomsday was disappointing. The story was a mess, the characters were not interesting and the voice actors were terribly miscast. Watch it for the fights and animation.

Doomsday is found in a spaceship underground and a simple puncture in the hull causes him to immediately break free of the ship.  What was he doing all that time?  Was he sleeping?  Was he in suspended animation?  Was he watching Loony Toons?  We'll never know.2. There are no other superheroes on earth.  Ahem, let me clarify that, THERE ARE NO OTHER SUPERHEROES ON EARTH.  A HUGE part of the success of the Death of Superman arc was the fact that no other superhero but Superman could stop Doomsday.  That gave the story an epic feel that is completely vacant here.  I felt nothing as Doomsday slaughtered weak little humans and animals on the way to Metropolis - another problem, by the way, as why has he chosen to go to Metropolis?  Give him a reason!3.  Doomsday's evolution ability is missing.  And then this movie goes and actually suggests that Doomsday is a machine!  A FREAKING MACHINE!4.  Doomsday is in this movie for 15 minutes max.  The movie should be titled SUPERMAN: NEMESIS as it is all about his clone and Lex Luthor.5.  This Luthor isn't as smart as Luthor really is.  He only has ONE failsafe to stop the clone Superman.  Sloppy!You dropped the ball on this one, creators.  Do yourself a favor and go watch the Justice League: Unlimited series.

But you have to remeamber how long the orginal storyline was. the entire thing simply could not all fit into the movie. some sacrifices had to be made as well ajustments.And I think they did a good job of telling the basic story.Secondly this is the second direct to DVD Superman story.the first Brianiac Attacks was just sold to make money because the movie Superman Returns had just come out. Brianiac Attacks was just plain terrible. yes there was some similer animation to the old superman series and some the same voice for superman. but all in all the plot was awful. and the lex luthor was terrible. coming off as some teenager rather then some menacing villain. and dont even get me started on Brianiac himself.This movie is FAR better then Brianiac Attacks. and frankly its a LOT better then Superman Returns.one last thing before I go on. this movie may not be suitible for all children. so if ur a parent buying this watch it first. seriously!moving on...all the voice actors did a fine job. even Hash did well as lois. Baldwin was an excellent superman. James Marsters went to town on luthor and did a great job even though the charture played a rather minor role.again the movie has most of the basics of the main story.it should be stated that this moive is within a different continuty then the early Superman series and the Justice leauge series. its a different story entirly.in this movie we have superman and lois getting serious. at that same time Doomsday comes up. the movie shortens the fight between Doomsday and Superman but again for a movie its better that way. the fight I might add is rather brutal and bloody.the actule 'death' of superman is done very well.here clark is sent away to afganistan while events take place.the movie does not do a whole lot of 'a world without superman' like the comics did. but i suposes thats better for time constrants.it at least shows how all the main chartures react to the situation. which is good.the toyman of this movie is very different. much more seeder but creepy.speaking of which watchout for the kevin smith cameo!now . . . again the 'reign of superman' is shortened.but elements are barrowed.instead of the cyborg superman there is just the clone superman (just as superboy was a clone)but any way in this movie the clone is an imperfect version of superman.he even kills toyman at one point. and again its a shocking scean.we see toyman fall to his death and hit a car. afterwerds a sheet covers his bleeding body.menwhile the real superman is back. as in the comics he has long hair and a solar suit. he faces his imperfect clone in a finel fight to the finish.the movie then neatly wraps up the storyline.its all a fairly decent adaptation of the death and return of superman.simplistic in story line but good.and its willing to push a few boundies as well.there are some rather shocking, creepy, and suprising sceans in this movie.but its all worth it.i very much enjoyed this movie.and would defitly recommend it to others.",4,DOOMSDAY Is Here,1231977600,"01

I had to upgrade to blu-ray on 5 early features to my library.Wonder WomanFirst FlightUnder the Red HoodPublic Enemiesof course...Superman/Doomsday.Which leads to this review. Superman/Doomsday is a long storyline in comic form that crossed over that multiple titles. Compressed to the animated form is well done...story wise. Many characters were not featured in this animated but that is a whole lot of stories to cram into. So the animators stuck to the gist with one storyline. Superman fights Doomsday to the bitter end. The story continues in Supes' resurrection. As always, Lex Luthor is the maniacal genius obessed with Superman. He is obsessed with killing Superman. Since he couldn't....he had to control him with the faux Superman. The Toyman storyline is a twist I didn't see coming. Kudos. All great stories compressed into a feature well done.Now the animation...would I had liked it to be like the others? Of course. The only other one I think that could had been better animation is Superman vs the Elite. All my DC collection is well liked. I think that DC animated teams are well done.In hindsight...could Superman/Doomsday used The Dark Knight Returns treatment? Perhaps.

I also knew that it would be a one movie deal, no sequels. So I went into this film knowing it could be real bad. It would be tough to put the real whole storyline together in 75min. but I figured with some tweaking and even a lot of changes and trimming of unneeded storyline from the original story, it could be done. Well they screwed the pooch on this one, from supermans facial lines (he looked in his 50s Lois in her late 20s)to what happened to Doomsday. I mean where did he go? Wheres his body? The battle at night with barely anyone around! Not in the day when everyone is around and total chaos like in the original. There was no need for the change. Also there was no build up for Doomsday He just got loose, walked over a mountain and entered Metropolis. That and the fight with Superman was like 10 min. tops and then thats all we see of him. Anyway I have a lot more but Im sure its been said already, so lets just end it with this: I knew the original storyline and I hated it.

1070159,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000PE0G0A,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[5, 7]","I wasn't paying much attention when Superman died.  It passed without fanfare in my geekiverse because I knew that Superman would come back, the same way I keep expecting Captain America to pop up any day now.Amazon Unbox downloaded this movie to my Tivo right after it taped the introduction of Superman to The Batman cartoon series, the current anime-inspired version of Batman.  And to my surprise, all of the voice actors from the Justice League cartoon series were back in the Batman cartoon: George Newbern as the serious Superman, Dana Delaney as the sarcastic Lois Lane, and Clancy Brown as the debonair and devious Lex Luthor. With both on my Tivo, it was easy to make a comparison between the two animated depictions of Superman.Warning: This review contains spoilers.  RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!The character designs have been altered a bit from the Superman animated series.  Superman (voiced by Adam Baldwin) has bizarrely drawn cheekbones in this movie.  Everyone else more or less looks the same, although Lex Luthor (voiced by James Marsters) is a ""white guy"" again; the Superman cartoon cast him as a Kojak-like darker skinned man who became progressively lighter skinned in each incarnation. Lois (voiced by Anne Heche, of all people) still looks like Lois, wearing impossibly short skirts and yet achieving an amazing range of athletic moves.  Three cheers for animated physics!Superman: Doomsday really enjoys its PG-13-ness. People say funny cuss words like ""freaking,"" have relations, and die -- bloodlessly, but they still die. This is an animation for grown-ups, folks!The voice actors do a suitable job.  Heche is actually the best of the bunch, providing a full range of emotions to Lois.  Adam Wylie is great as Jimmy Olsen, but I don't give him quite as much props as he's not exactly new to the DC animation universe (he's the voice of Brainiac 5 in Legion of Super-Heroes). The most egregious loss is Brown as Lex Luthor.  Clancy Brown's gravelly baritone has always given the character a subtle menace.  In Superman: Doomsday, Lex is just a bald guy with an attitude.And thus we have the first of several problems with this movie. Lex is a one-dimensional villain bent on destroying Superman.  You know you're in trouble when you can make ""he's so evil..."" jokes. For example:* Lex is so evil, he has the cure for cancer but doesn't share it with the world!* He's so evil, he has a special room created just for beating up Superman!* He's so evil, he shoots his own henchmen to cover up his operations!Lex practically cackles his way through the entire series and is so patently unlikable that he hardly seems like an actual foil for Superman.  In fact, the only noteworthy contribution Lex contributes is his gripe that Superman was killed by an ""intergalactic soccer hooligan!"" I have to agree with him.After a long, protracted fight with a goofy-looking muscle-bound gargoyle named Doomsday, Superman dies.What made the death of Superman so important was the way the writers dealt with his death. Superman is as much a divine being and an iconic symbol as he is an alien who protects Earth; his death had emotional repercussions on the level of Elvis and Marilyn Monroe, and the comics made a point of showing what a world without Superman was like.  His death helped create Steel and Superboy and other heroes I didn't keep track of because I wasn't reading the comics at the time.You won't find any of that here.  We have a few minutes of mourning, a few minutes of revelations (Lois knew Superman's identity, Lois meets Martha Kent, Lois and Superman were getting it on), and then Superman returns.  Only he's mean.And so, Superman: Doomsday isn't just about Superman dying at the hands of a super villain - it's about Superman being the not-so-noble guy we always knew he could be.  This new, resurrected version acts with brutal efficiency.  That's most epitomized by his murder of the Toyman after Superman 2.0 discovers that Toyman escape from prison and killed a little girl in a hostage crisis.There's a reckoning, of course: two Supermen battling it out, comparable to the Doomsday fight only with more blood and clever asides. And like the end of the movie, punch for punch, the old Superman (Animated Series) beats the new Superman (Doomsday), hands down.",3,Oldie Beats Goodie,1191456000,"10 4, 2007",2007,4294,"['was', ""n't"", 'paying', 'much', 'attention', 'when', 'Superman', 'died', 'passed', 'fanfare', 'geekiverse', 'knew', 'Superman', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'same', 'way', 'keep', 'expecting', 'Captain', 'America', 'pop', 'up', 'day', 'now.Amazon', 'Unbox', 'downloaded', 'movie', 'Tivo', 'right', 'taped', 'introduction', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'cartoon', 'series', 'current', 'anime-inspired', 'version', 'Batman', 'surprise', 'voice', 'actors', 'Justice', 'League', 'cartoon', 'series', 'were', 'back', 'Batman', 'cartoon', 'George', 'Newbern', 'serious', 'Superman', 'Dana', 'Delaney', 'sarcastic', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'debonair', 'devious', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Tivo', 'was', 'easy', 'make', 'comparison', 'two', 'animated', 'depictions', 'Superman.Warning', 'review', 'spoilers', 'RUN', 'YOUR', 'LIVES', 'character', 'designs', 'have', 'been', 'altered', 'bit', 'Superman', 'animated', 'series', 'Superman', 'voiced', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'bizarrely', 'drawn', 'cheekbones', 'movie', 'Everyone', 'else', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'voiced', 'James', 'Marsters', 'white', 'guy', 'again', 'Superman', 'cartoon', 'cast', 'Kojak-like', 'darker', 'skinned', 'man', 'who', 'became', 'progressively', 'lighter', 'skinned', 'incarnation', 'Lois', 'voiced', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'people', 'still', 'Lois', 'wearing', 'impossibly', 'short', 'skirts', 'yet', 'achieving', 'amazing', 'range', 'athletic', 'moves', 'Three', 'cheers', 'animated', 'physics', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'really', 'PG-13-ness', 'People', 'say', 'funny', 'cuss', 'words', 'freaking', 'have', 'relations', 'die', 'bloodlessly', 'still', 'die', 'animation', 'grown-ups', 'folks', 'voice', 'actors', 'do', 'suitable', 'job', 'Heche', 'actually', 'best', 'bunch', 'providing', 'full', 'range', 'emotions', 'Lois', 'Adam', 'Wylie', 'great', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'props', 'not', 'exactly', 'new', 'DC', 'animation', 'universe', 'voice', 'Brainiac', '5', 'Legion', 'Super-Heroes', 'most', 'egregious', 'loss', 'Brown', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'gravelly', 'baritone', 'always', 'given', 'character', 'subtle', 'menace', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'Lex', 'just', 'bald', 'guy', 'attitude.And', 'thus', 'have', 'first', 'several', 'problems', 'movie', 'Lex', 'one-dimensional', 'villain', 'bent', 'destroying', 'Superman', 'know', ""'re"", 'trouble', 'when', 'can', 'make', 'so', 'evil', 'jokes', 'example', '*', 'Lex', 'so', 'evil', 'cure', 'cancer', ""n't"", 'share', 'world', '*', 'so', 'evil', 'special', 'room', 'created', 'just', 'beating', 'up', 'Superman', '*', 'so', 'evil', 'shoots', 'own', 'henchmen', 'cover', 'up', 'operations', 'Lex', 'practically', 'way', 'entire', 'series', 'so', 'patently', 'unlikable', 'hardly', 'actual', 'foil', 'Superman', 'fact', 'only', 'noteworthy', 'contribution', 'Lex', 'gripe', 'Superman', 'was', 'killed', 'intergalactic', 'soccer', 'hooligan', 'have', 'agree', 'him.After', 'long', 'protracted', 'fight', 'goofy-looking', 'muscle-bound', 'gargoyle', 'named', 'Doomsday', 'Superman', 'made', 'death', 'Superman', 'so', 'important', 'was', 'way', 'writers', 'dealt', 'death', 'Superman', 'as', 'much', 'divine', 'being', 'iconic', 'symbol', 'alien', 'who', 'Earth', 'death', 'had', 'emotional', 'repercussions', 'level', 'Elvis', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'comics', 'made', 'point', 'showing', 'what', 'world', 'Superman', 'was', 'death', 'helped', 'create', 'Steel', 'Superboy', 'other', 'heroes', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'track', 'was', ""n't"", 'reading', 'comics', 'time.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'have', 'few', 'minutes', 'mourning', 'few', 'minutes', 'revelations', 'Lois', 'knew', 'Superman', 'identity', 'Lois', 'Martha', 'Kent', 'Lois', 'Superman', 'were', 'getting', 'then', 'Superman', 'returns', 'Only', 'mean.And', 'so', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', ""n't"", 'just', 'Superman', 'dying', 'hands', 'super', 'villain', 'Superman', 'being', 'not-so-noble', 'guy', 'always', 'knew', 'could', 'be', 'new', 'resurrected', 'version', 'acts', 'brutal', 'efficiency', 'most', 'epitomized', 'murder', 'Toyman', 'Superman', '2.0', 'discovers', 'Toyman', 'escape', 'prison', 'killed', 'little', 'girl', 'hostage', 'crisis.There', 'reckoning', 'course', 'two', 'Supermen', 'battling', 'out', 'comparable', 'Doomsday', 'fight', 'only', 'more', 'blood', 'clever', 'asides', 'end', 'movie', 'punch', 'punch', 'old', 'Superman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'new', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'down']",Superman: Doomsday

1070161,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B000PE0G0A,mitchell5954,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Superman Doomsday is the first film in the DC direct-to-video lineup. Superman Doomsday, to be honest, is one big missed opportunity. The Death of Superman in the comics is one of my favorite Superman stories. This movie just felt very phoned in. The action is alright, but the story is where this movie falls apart in.The story begins with Doomsday breaking out of a facility underground and goes on a rampage until he reaches Metropolis. Superman fights Doomsday and ultimately ""dies."" Sometime afterwords Lex Luthor has cloned Superman to do his bidding. The clone, however, turns out to be defective and before long aims to rule Metropolis with an iron fist. Superman then returns and stops him.The main reason why this film did not work is its length. The Death of Superman story is an arc that spans not just Superman's death but also the aftermath of his death. After Superman dies by the hands of Doomsday four Superman impersonators come to take his place; Steel, Eradicator, Superboy, and Cyborg. That is too much material to fit into an hour and fifteen minute movie. This film should have been separated into to movies like The Dark Knight Returns was. However they try to cram everything into one film and it does not really work. Instead of the four Supermen we get a generic defective Superman clone, which is not that interesting. Plus the middle portion of the film got very boring with many unnecessary scenes they could have cut out.The characters are okay, but some of the casting choices I do not agree with. Adam Baldwin does alright as Superman. However, I would much rather have Tim Daly come back to voice Superman, especially since this Superman looks a lot like Superman in the animated series. Anne Heche is a bad Lois Lane. Her accent did not work at all. She is probably the worst Lois Lane that I have seen. James Marsters as Lex was okay, but not nearly as good as Clancy Brown. The other voices were okay, but nothing spectacular. The voice-acting overall ranged from okay to bad.The action was great and fun. The animation is also quite good. I would say that the animation was on par if not better than Justice League. The music is also very nice. The action and animation are easily the best aspects of the movie. However the action scenes are few and far between. We have one big action scene at the beginning and one at the end, but the middle was quite boring.Overall Superman Doomsday is ultimately a lackluster start to the DC animated lineup.

1070162,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B000PE0G0A,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 1]","When a team of workmen drilling for LexCorp release the creature of destruction known as Doomsday, Superman is the only one who can stop him, but possibly at the cost of his own life. After the violent battle, Superman's friends, family, enemies, and truly the whole world have to learn to live without the Man of Steel. Until, from out of nowhere, he appears to be back! But, this resurrected Superman seems to be acting rather strangely...I'm not totally sure why ""Superman: Doomsday"" is considered the first in the line of DC animated direct-to-video movies. There WERE a few before it for Batman and Superman, but regardless, this film was a great ""start"" to a fantastic line of films. I wish Disney had paid some attention to what W.B. did here and used their direct to video animation department for feature films based on their classic 80's and 90's Disney Afternoon cartoons instead of sequels to their animated classics, so the products would be an upgrade from the source material rather than a downgrade. But, I digress. ""Superman: Doomsday"" is an excellent film about, more than anything, the importance of Superman to the people in his world. Directed by Bruce Timm and co., this film was supposed to be trying to look and feel very different from Timm's fantastic TV series universe, but honestly, it only seems different due to the story having its own cannon and the characters having different designs. However, they all still look like Timm creations, so what I mean by saying it is not very different is that everyone here looks and acts very much like they could be from that same universe, even if Lex doesn't look like the TV Lex and Superman doesn't look precisely like the TV Superman. Lois looks quite different. Hard to say which version I find more attractive visually (neither Loises have really been my type in voice and personality), but again, I digress. I'd say everything comes off as well done and well performed as on those great TV shows, only here things get a bit more violent and sometimes a bit more sexy. Naturally, the sex stuff is just implied, while we do see people getting bloodied and killed full on, ha. Lex is pretty great in this, though I don't love his design as much. As with all these films, sometimes you have some corny lines, maybe sometimes it's the delivery of the lines, I don't know, usually from extras like Lex's hammy workmen or when characters are trying to be sexy, but like I said, overall, this is a lot like the Bruce Timm/Paul Dini TV shows, which, of course, is a very good thing and what many of us wanted more of (I will never have enough of Timm's D.C. stuff). Something to note though, is that each of these direct to video films is supposed to take place in its own... I'll use the term ""universe"" again. As in, none of them are supposed to be connected to the TV show or be a direct sequel to another one, though I'm not sure if that rule has been broken since things first started out with this film (I'm a wee bit behind on these lately).If you're a fan of the DC Universe, especially the Bruce Timm animated stuff, I highly recommend this film and the whole line of D.C. direct-to-video animated features. Most always seem to outdo the previous films or at least equal them, from the ones I've seen at least. I also find these to be far superior to the Marvel direct-to-video animated features that started up around the same time. Those are still worth checking out, but it seems that usually Marvel shines in live-action while D.C. shines in animation (yeah, Dark Knight is amazing, but that's one phase of one franchise). The Blu-Ray for ""Superman: Doomsday"" is quite good, with a ton of excellent bonus features. There are a handful of documentaries about the comics and the making of the film, four select episodes from Superman the Animated Series (Mxyzpixilated, which is a fave of mine, Brave New Metropolis, and Apokolips...Now! Parts 1 and 2, all are great), and, besides some trailers for other animated features, a rather fun commentary featuring the directors and other crew members is also included. Like I said, this is a great start to a great line of films that is still going (and that I need to catch up with). It is NOT directly based on any of the comics, though it does borrow from the famous Death of Superman saga. Don't expect comic book canon, just expect a super movie that even outdoes some of the live-action Superman films!",5,The first in a great line of direct-to-video films!,1340668800,"06 26, 2012",2012,4433,"['When', 'team', 'workmen', 'drilling', 'LexCorp', 'release', 'creature', 'destruction', 'known', 'Doomsday', 'Superman', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'stop', 'possibly', 'cost', 'own', 'life', 'violent', 'battle', 'Superman', 'friends', 'family', 'enemies', 'truly', 'whole', 'world', 'have', 'learn', 'live', 'Man', 'Steel', 'nowhere', 'be', 'back', 'resurrected', 'Superman', 'be', 'acting', 'rather', 'strangely', ""'m"", 'not', 'totally', 'sure', 'why', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'considered', 'first', 'line', 'DC', 'animated', 'direct-to-video', 'movies', 'few', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'regardless', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'start', 'fantastic', 'line', 'films', 'wish', 'Disney', 'had', 'paid', 'attention', 'what', 'W.B', 'did', 'here', 'used', 'direct', 'video', 'animation', 'department', 'feature', 'films', 'based', 'classic', '80', '90', 'Disney', 'Afternoon', 'cartoons', 'instead', 'sequels', 'animated', 'classics', 'products', 'would', 'be', 'upgrade', 'source', 'material', 'rather', 'downgrade', 'digress', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'excellent', 'film', 'more', 'anything', 'importance', 'Superman', 'people', 'world', 'Directed', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'co.', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'trying', 'look', 'feel', 'very', 'different', 'Timm', 'fantastic', 'TV', 'series', 'universe', 'honestly', 'only', 'different', 'due', 'story', 'having', 'own', 'cannon', 'characters', 'having', 'different', 'designs', 'However', 'still', 'look', 'Timm', 'creations', 'what', 'mean', 'saying', 'not', 'very', 'different', 'everyone', 'here', 'very', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'same', 'universe', 'even', 'Lex', ""n't"", 'look', 'TV', 'Lex', 'Superman', ""n't"", 'look', 'precisely', 'TV', 'Superman', 'Lois', 'quite', 'different', 'Hard', 'say', 'version', 'find', 'more', 'attractive', 'visually', 'Loises', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'type', 'voice', 'personality', 'again', 'digress', ""'d"", 'say', 'everything', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'performed', 'great', 'TV', 'shows', 'only', 'here', 'things', 'get', 'bit', 'more', 'violent', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'more', 'sexy', 'Naturally', 'sex', 'stuff', 'just', 'implied', 'do', 'see', 'people', 'getting', 'bloodied', 'killed', 'full', 'ha', 'Lex', 'pretty', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'design', 'as', 'much', 'films', 'sometimes', 'have', 'corny', 'lines', 'maybe', 'delivery', 'lines', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'usually', 'extras', 'Lex', 'hammy', 'workmen', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'trying', 'be', 'sexy', 'said', 'overall', 'lot', 'Bruce', 'Timm/Paul', 'Dini', 'TV', 'shows', 'course', 'very', 'good', 'thing', 'what', 'many', 'wanted', 'more', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'enough', 'Timm', 'D.C.', 'stuff', 'Something', 'note', 'direct', 'video', 'films', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'own', ""'ll"", 'use', 'term', 'universe', 'again', 'none', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'connected', 'TV', 'show', 'be', 'direct', 'sequel', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'rule', 'been', 'broken', 'things', 'first', 'started', 'out', 'film', ""'m"", 'wee', 'bit', 'lately', '.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'DC', 'Universe', 'especially', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'animated', 'stuff', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'whole', 'line', 'D.C.', 'direct-to-video', 'animated', 'features', 'Most', 'always', 'seem', 'outdo', 'previous', 'films', 'least', 'equal', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'also', 'find', 'be', 'far', 'superior', 'Marvel', 'direct-to-video', 'animated', 'features', 'started', 'up', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'still', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'usually', 'Marvel', 'shines', 'live-action', 'D.C.', 'shines', 'animation', 'yeah', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'amazing', 'one', 'phase', 'one', 'franchise', 'Blu-Ray', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'quite', 'good', 'ton', 'excellent', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'handful', 'documentaries', 'comics', 'making', 'film', 'four', 'select', 'episodes', 'Superman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'Mxyzpixilated', 'fave', 'mine', 'Brave', 'New', 'Metropolis', 'Apokolips', 'Now', 'Parts', '1', '2', 'are', 'great', 'trailers', 'other', 'animated', 'features', 'rather', 'fun', 'commentary', 'featuring', 'directors', 'other', 'crew', 'members', 'also', 'included', 'said', 'great', 'start', 'great', 'line', 'films', 'still', 'going', 'need', 'catch', 'up', 'NOT', 'directly', 'based', 'comics', 'borrow', 'famous', 'Death', 'Superman', 'saga', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'comic', 'book', 'canon', 'just', 'expect', 'super', 'movie', 'even', 'live-action', 'Superman', 'films']",Superman: Doomsday

The Man of Steel (voiced by Serenity's Adam Baldwin) is in love with Lois Lane (voiced quite stiffly by Anne Heche) and both are enjoying their relationship, until his world is rocked by the arrival of the murderous creature Doomsday, who is inadvertantly let loose by Lex Luthor (Buffy the Vampire Slayer's James ""Spike"" Marsters).  If you've read the comics, you know what happens next, but the animated feature wisely ignores the Reign of the Supermen part of the arc, in place of an imposter created by Luthor, which results in an apocalyptic showdown.  Being the first in a line of newly animated features, don't go into this expecting something among the lines of the DC animated series' that had come before it.  The animation itself looks similar to what we've seen before (veteran animator Bruce Timm is heavily involved here), but the tone is noticibly different.  The voice acting is solid (Marsters is magnificent as Luthor, while Baldwin is servicable as Superman) and the action is nicely orchestrated as well, all of which makes Superman: Doomsday an animated treat.

1070172,AZXFS8GCTSQ5R,B000PE0G0A,NF,"[1, 1]","Let me first say that I don't think a movie needs to be totally faithful to the original source material. I've never seen any correlation between faithfulness and quality, with some terrible movies that are totally faithful and some superb movies that are only marginally related to the original. In this case, the movie is loosely based on three comic sequences: telling the story of the death of superman, the world without a superman, and the return of superman. The video covers all three of these in just 87 minutes, although it gives relatively short shrift to the center story.In the first section, we see Superman battling an indestructible, unstoppable force, a doomsday weapon whose mission is to destroy all life it encounters. The weapon was locked away on Earth centuries ago but was uncovered by an expedition from Luthor, seeking new energy sources. Superman succeeds in stopping Doomsay but I don't think it is a spoiler to reveal that the victory comes at the cost of his life.The second section is fairly brief, with a look at the impact of the death of Superman, as crime increases, the world mourns, and even Luthor is upset at the loss because he feels that he was robbed of his chance at defeating Superman, once and for all. Finally, in the third section, we see what appears to be Superman reborn, but is he? Something has changed, and not in a good way.So how is this as a video? Just middlin', which is why I've given it three stars (I'm being a bit charitable since I'd like to give it 2.5 stars). It's not terrible but it definitely could have been better. The three elements of a good animated video are the voice acting, the quality of the animation, and, above all, the story. The voice acting is just fair, overall. Adam Baldwin does a decent job as Superman but James Marsters' Luthor is too cerebral, lacking the passion that usually accompanies that role, and Anne Heche as Lois Lane appears to be on auto-pilot for much of the movie. She needs to be the heart of the movie, as we witness these events through her eyes, but she is simply not up to the challenge.Similarly, the animation is middle-of-the-road, neither terrible nor wonderful. There were no sequences that really blew me away and Superman's face, in particular, bothered me, as they used a crude line to indicate cheekbones. It made it look like Superman had some kind of facial tattoos.The story is also lacking a bit, as they tried to squeeze too much into too small a time. I think they'd have been better served by releasing this in two parts, which would have allowed them to add the elements to make the whole story more compelling. As it is, the video basically consists of two massive slug-fests, with just enough filler to make it a bit more interesting. i like a good fight sequence as much as anyone but I also like a little more variety. In particular, I'd have liked to see a bit more setup, to show how deadly Doomsday really was and how Superman really was the last and only hope for defeating it.As I said, it's not a terrible movie and as an inexpensive rental, it's worth a look.",3,Just okay,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,3097,"['Let', 'first', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'be', 'totally', 'faithful', 'original', 'source', 'material', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'correlation', 'faithfulness', 'quality', 'terrible', 'movies', 'are', 'totally', 'faithful', 'superb', 'movies', 'are', 'only', 'marginally', 'related', 'original', 'case', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'three', 'comic', 'sequences', 'telling', 'story', 'death', 'superman', 'world', 'superman', 'return', 'superman', 'video', 'three', 'just', '87', 'minutes', 'relatively', 'short', 'shrift', 'center', 'story.In', 'first', 'section', 'see', 'Superman', 'battling', 'indestructible', 'unstoppable', 'force', 'doomsday', 'weapon', 'mission', 'destroy', 'life', 'weapon', 'was', 'locked', 'away', 'Earth', 'centuries', 'ago', 'was', 'uncovered', 'expedition', 'Luthor', 'seeking', 'new', 'energy', 'sources', 'Superman', 'stopping', 'Doomsay', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'spoiler', 'reveal', 'victory', 'cost', 'life.The', 'second', 'section', 'fairly', 'brief', 'look', 'impact', 'death', 'Superman', 'crime', 'increases', 'world', 'even', 'Luthor', 'upset', 'loss', 'was', 'robbed', 'chance', 'defeating', 'Superman', 'once', 'Finally', 'third', 'section', 'see', 'what', 'be', 'Superman', 'reborn', 'Something', 'changed', 'not', 'good', 'way.So', 'how', 'video', 'Just', 'middlin', 'why', ""'ve"", 'given', 'three', 'stars', ""'m"", 'being', 'bit', 'charitable', ""'d"", 'like', 'give', '2.5', 'stars', 'not', 'terrible', 'definitely', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'three', 'elements', 'good', 'animated', 'video', 'are', 'voice', 'acting', 'quality', 'animation', 'story', 'voice', 'acting', 'just', 'fair', 'overall', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'decent', 'job', 'Superman', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Luthor', 'too', 'cerebral', 'lacking', 'passion', 'usually', 'role', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'be', 'auto-pilot', 'much', 'movie', 'be', 'heart', 'movie', 'witness', 'events', 'eyes', 'simply', 'not', 'challenge.Similarly', 'animation', 'middle-of-the-road', 'terrible', 'wonderful', 'were', 'sequences', 'really', 'blew', 'away', 'Superman', 'face', 'particular', 'bothered', 'used', 'crude', 'line', 'indicate', 'cheekbones', 'made', 'look', 'Superman', 'had', 'kind', 'facial', 'tattoos.The', 'story', 'also', 'lacking', 'bit', 'tried', 'squeeze', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'small', 'time', 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'releasing', 'two', 'parts', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'add', 'elements', 'make', 'whole', 'story', 'more', 'compelling', 'video', 'basically', 'two', 'massive', 'slug-fests', 'just', 'enough', 'filler', 'make', 'bit', 'more', 'interesting', 'i', 'good', 'fight', 'sequence', 'as', 'much', 'anyone', 'also', 'little', 'more', 'variety', 'particular', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'bit', 'more', 'setup', 'show', 'how', 'deadly', 'Doomsday', 'really', 'was', 'how', 'Superman', 'really', 'was', 'last', 'only', 'hope', 'defeating', 'it.As', 'said', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'inexpensive', 'rental', 'look']",Superman: Doomsday

Doomsday, unnamed in the movie, escapes from a subterranean prison and goes on a rampage.  Only Superman stands between the monster & the deaths of millions.  And it required the ultimate sacrifice to stop the beast.Overall, it was a decent adaptation of the great Superman trilogy of story arcs (""The Death of Superman"", ""World Without a Superman"" & ""The Return of Superman"").  I did miss the other heroes banding together to try & stop Doomsday on his cross-country rampage and in the funeral procession.  The Lois-Clark relationship wasn't what I expected - it harkened back to the old days when Lois tolerated Clark but adored Superman.  (In the comics of the time, Lois & Clark were already engaged &, naturally, she knew he was Superman which brought more pathos to the comic death scene in my opinion.)The voice casting, which was completely changed from the old cartoons, was pretty good for the most part.  The one grating aspect was Anne Heche as Lois Lane.  For the 1st 20 minutes or so, I heard her voice, not Lois.  (Here they should've retained Dana Delany for the voice.)  Adam Baldwin as Clark/Superman was a good choice as was Ray Wise for Perry White.  James Marsters, of Buffy/Angel fame, was good as Luthor but I missed the grating menace when Clancy Brown voiced the character.A darker story than previous Superman outings but, given the subject matter, not surprising.

Those people need to get out a dictionary and look up the meaning of the word, ""Adaptation."" The epic comic book tale, featuring four (rather than one) surrogate Supermen, Supergirl, a somewhat different Lex Luthor and guest appearances by the Justice League as well as the additional villain Mongul would be impossible to do in a 75 minute movie.Different media have different needs and what Bruce Timm and his team have done is create a great story that captures the spirit of the comics while bringing some entirely new twists.  Some of the changes (such as sending Clark to Afghanistan at the beginning of the story, thus making his unexplained silence after Superman dies easier to explain) are improvements on the original. Other alterations offer some really surprising twists to the fans who do know the story (one, including a terrifyingly redesigned Toyman will have true Superman fans gasping). And most of all, the relationship between Superman and Lois has never been handled with such depth and complexity... it offers some genuine emotion at a number of points in the film.The action is great, the voices are mostly excellent (although Anne Heche's gruff Lois takes a while to get used to) and it's fun to see how the animators have integrated elements from many sources, including SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE (there's a shot of Supes taking off that's lifted directly from the film), SMALLVILLE and SUPERMAN RETURNS (Jonathan Kent isn't alive in this and Martha seems to have the same kind of melancholic disconnect to her son as in that film). Of course, small nods to comics creators are in evidence and there's even an inside dig at producer Jon Peters' infamous edict to have Superman battle a giant spider (voiced by an animated Kevin Smith).The film's not perfect... one wishes that the Doomsday portion of the film would've had just a tad more heft to it, and a subplot involving Jimmy Olsen being wooed by a Tabloid feels forced, but those are minor quibbles.The plethora of added bonus features, including an in-depth look at the hysteria that the original ""Death of Superman"" comics wraught, make this a must-have for even a casual Superman fan.

1070198,ADKA2MJQQCMTO,B000PE0G0A,Ron Sullivan,"[4, 5]","I've been a comic book geek for what feels like forever.  Some of my earliest memories are of being taken out to the local magazine store by my father and just pouring over all the different worlds there was that I could immerse myself in.  In my collecting career, there were probably three moments that I'd consider real highlights.  The first was the 'Knightfall' storyline when Bane broke Batman's back, the second was the 'Dark Phoenix' saga in the Marvel universe, and finally there was the 'Death of Superman.'  Needless to say, when I found out a 'Superman-Doomsday' DVD was being developed; the nerd in me was doing cartwheels.  I'm sorry to say that after seeing the finished product, I was left pretty let down.I'll start with the animation itself.  It's obvious that Bruce Timm's fingerprints were all over this.  That being said, I'm scratching my head over the decision to set this outside the standard continuity of the Superman series that Timm helped to create.  Clark Kent is drawn with these weird facial lines that I suppose was done to make him look a little older.  The problem with this is why you would then de-age everyone else?  Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, and the rest of the supporting cast seem to appear younger then they should.  Why wouldn't you just use the same character template that the animated series used?The voice acting was OK, but the cast had me (again) puzzled.  I don't understand the choice not to bring in the original voice-actors (George Newbern or Tim Daly/ Dana Delany/ Clancy Brown), all of whom had been voicing the same roles for quite awhile now.  Just as an example, I mentioned earlier that Lois Lane looks younger; Ann Heche was then the choice to lend her voice?  Not that Heche didn't do a credible job, it's just that she ""sounds"" about as old as she probably is.  Her voice didn't seem to fit her younger-looking avatar.  Even the relationship between Lois and Superman ""looked"" odd now that they appeared to have such a pronounced age difference.Reviewers had mentioned this before, but the storyline itself is butchered.  Playing devil's advocate though, I understand a lot of these changes had to be made.  In the comics, this story-arc was massive.  It took a long time to resolve, involved a ton of characters, and happened across (I think) about four or five books.  There's simply too much material to squeeze into an hour and a half and have it make any sense at all.  Having said that, however, as far as I'm aware, this went direct to DVD and was never on any network broadcast; the running time on the film is definitely under eighty minutes.  Timm and company, considering they didn't have to take commercial breaks into account, realistically, probably had about ten extra minutes (at least) that they could have used to add meat to the story.Speaking of the story, one of the things I enjoyed the most about the comic book version was the sense of scale.  It was jaw-dropping watching Doomsday crash to earth and systematically dismantle the DC universe.  Watching hero after hero fall to him, and watching the Justice League torn apart by him gave Doomsday's power the proper sense of scale.  The comic accomplished two things by the time the showdown between Superman and Doomsday was ready to take place.  The first is, as I mentioned, that you had plenty of time to appreciate just how powerful Doomsday actually is and the second, after the fall of the Justice League, is that it properly portrays Superman as (literally) the 'last line of defense.'  In the animated film, I feel like this sense of scale is completely lost.  Doomsday, in my opinion, just looks like a beast that shows up and got a little lucky.  Taking the Justice League out of the equasion and not seeing the reaction of the rest of the DC universe, seems to rob Superman's death of its significance.This goes back to my earlier point about the running time, but I don't understand why we saw so little of Doomsday.  I'd venture to guess his time on screen is about a third of the total running time.  Considering the title, I really thought he'd be around longer.  This is more a story of Superman and his clone then Doomsday.All in all, Superman-Doomsday isn't awful.  It's just that I feel if a couple of decisions were made differently that this could have gone immediately from just `OK' to `Outstanding.' My biggest complaint, and it's a point I know I keep going back to, is that there just doesn't seem to be the proper sense of scale for anything.  If DC chose to recreate one of their premiere story-lines, they did themselves a disservice by not putting it in the proper context.",2,Bit of a Letdown,1228953600,"12 11, 2008",2008,4637,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'comic', 'book', 'geek', 'what', 'feels', 'forever', 'earliest', 'memories', 'are', 'being', 'taken', 'out', 'local', 'magazine', 'store', 'father', 'just', 'pouring', 'different', 'worlds', 'there', 'was', 'could', 'immerse', 'collecting', 'career', 'were', 'probably', 'three', 'moments', ""'d"", 'consider', 'real', 'highlights', 'first', 'was', ""'Knightfall"", 'storyline', 'when', 'Bane', 'broke', 'Batman', 'back', 'second', 'was', ""'Dark"", 'Phoenix', 'saga', 'Marvel', 'universe', 'finally', 'was', ""'Death"", 'Superman', 'Needless', 'say', 'when', 'found', 'out', ""'Superman-Doomsday"", 'DVD', 'was', 'being', 'developed', 'nerd', 'was', 'doing', 'cartwheels', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'seeing', 'finished', 'product', 'was', 'left', 'pretty', 'let', 'down.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'animation', 'obvious', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'fingerprints', 'were', 'being', 'said', ""'m"", 'scratching', 'head', 'decision', 'set', 'standard', 'continuity', 'Superman', 'series', 'Timm', 'helped', 'create', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'drawn', 'weird', 'facial', 'lines', 'suppose', 'was', 'done', 'make', 'look', 'little', 'older', 'problem', 'why', 'would', 'then', 'de-age', 'everyone', 'else', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'seem', 'appear', 'younger', 'then', 'should', 'Why', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'use', 'same', 'character', 'template', 'animated', 'series', 'used', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'OK', 'cast', 'had', 'again', 'puzzled', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'choice', 'not', 'bring', 'original', 'voice-actors', 'George', 'Newbern', 'Tim', 'Daly/', 'Dana', 'Delany/', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'whom', 'had', 'been', 'voicing', 'same', 'roles', 'quite', 'awhile', 'now', 'Just', 'example', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'younger', 'Ann', 'Heche', 'was', 'then', 'choice', 'lend', 'voice', 'Not', 'Heche', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'credible', 'job', 'just', 'sounds', 'as', 'old', 'probably', 'voice', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'younger-looking', 'avatar', 'Even', 'relationship', 'Lois', 'Superman', 'looked', 'odd', 'now', 'appeared', 'have', 'pronounced', 'age', 'difference.Reviewers', 'had', 'mentioned', 'storyline', 'butchered', 'Playing', 'devil', 'advocate', 'understand', 'lot', 'changes', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'comics', 'story-arc', 'was', 'massive', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'resolve', 'involved', 'ton', 'characters', 'happened', 'think', 'four', 'five', 'books', 'simply', 'too', 'much', 'material', 'squeeze', 'hour', 'half', 'have', 'make', 'sense', 'Having', 'said', 'however', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'aware', 'went', 'direct', 'DVD', 'was', 'never', 'network', 'broadcast', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'definitely', 'eighty', 'minutes', 'Timm', 'company', 'considering', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'take', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'account', 'realistically', 'probably', 'had', 'ten', 'extra', 'minutes', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'add', 'meat', 'story.Speaking', 'story', 'one', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'comic', 'book', 'version', 'was', 'sense', 'scale', 'was', 'jaw-dropping', 'watching', 'Doomsday', 'crash', 'earth', 'systematically', 'dismantle', 'DC', 'universe', 'Watching', 'hero', 'hero', 'fall', 'watching', 'Justice', 'League', 'apart', 'gave', 'Doomsday', 'power', 'proper', 'sense', 'scale', 'comic', 'accomplished', 'two', 'things', 'time', 'showdown', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'was', 'ready', 'take', 'place', 'first', 'mentioned', 'had', 'plenty', 'time', 'appreciate', 'just', 'how', 'powerful', 'Doomsday', 'actually', 'second', 'fall', 'Justice', 'League', 'properly', 'Superman', 'literally', ""'last"", 'line', 'defense', 'animated', 'film', 'feel', 'sense', 'scale', 'completely', 'lost', 'Doomsday', 'opinion', 'just', 'beast', 'up', 'got', 'little', 'lucky', 'Taking', 'Justice', 'League', 'equasion', 'not', 'seeing', 'reaction', 'rest', 'DC', 'universe', 'rob', 'Superman', 'death', 'significance.This', 'back', 'earlier', 'point', 'running', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'saw', 'so', 'little', 'Doomsday', ""'d"", 'venture', 'guess', 'time', 'screen', 'third', 'total', 'running', 'time', 'Considering', 'title', 'really', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'around', 'longer', 'more', 'story', 'Superman', 'clone', 'then', 'Doomsday.All', 'Superman-Doomsday', ""n't"", 'awful', 'just', 'feel', 'couple', 'decisions', 'were', 'made', 'differently', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'immediately', 'just', 'OK', 'Outstanding', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'point', 'know', 'keep', 'going', 'back', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'proper', 'sense', 'scale', 'anything', 'DC', 'chose', 'recreate', 'one', 'premiere', 'story-lines', 'did', 'disservice', 'not', 'putting', 'proper', 'context']",Superman: Doomsday

Before I watched it I was expecting something spectacular and worthy of the name DC Comics/Universe.  Instead, the animation was simple, the acting too rigid and forced, and the storyline too obvious and somewhat embarrassing.MOVIE CONTENT DISCUSSION BELOW!!Why was I embarrassed?  Well for starters the ""Eveil Toyman"" was just bizarre and creepy, but not creepy in the ""Wow that character is so creepy that I feel empathy for the victims"" but creepy in a ""I'm really uncomfortable watching this in the company of my friends wondering if they're thinking what I'm thinking and that eerie silence kinda says I'm right.""  The role was totally a strange introduction, plus the actor that played the role reminded me of Andy Circus but without the convincing zealousness.Then, to have Superman actually ""Die"" at the hands of a ""Monster"" with big ole' teeth and claws for knuckles and mega big was a huge disappointment.  So Superman has tackled every single entity in the universe but a big ole' strong being from another planet that is ancient apparently is too much of a brute for the invincible man from Krypton.  Why didn't the writers spend a little more time really coming up with something that was more convincing like a liquid / gaseous villain that doesn't have the intelligence of right and wrong, just plain eveil with a killer instinct that even Superman has never seen?  Something that could evade Superman in a way besides brute contact?  After watching the ""Extras"" and viewing how proud the writers were about the effort they put forth into the ""Death of Superman"" surely they could have come up with something much better than ""Super Hulk.""  Also, how is Superman serving the good city of Metropolis by having it out ""IN"" the city?  Didn't he just kill a ton of people why he pounded his opponents 911 style?  That above all was the most offensive part of the storyline, the disregard for the fact this superhero just did major damage to his beloved city.  But everyone seems okay with that though, no harm no foul.  It's all good.  WHAH???Finally my disappointment is rounded off by an animation style that seems so overdone and bland.  ""Oooo wow, a building is exploding.  Oh my look, those two are going to crash into another building that looks like something from the T.V. show.""  Why didn't they step it up a bit?

It's an 'animated feature film.'"" This clarification for some reason always seems to bring on even more chuckles over a bottle of wine with friends than it does clarify the matter.Anyway, My kids were as captivated as I was for Superman - Doomsday. What is with the PG-13 rating of Superman - Doomsday?...I remember a couple of scenes inFinding Nemothat were more intense for young children, but Nemo gets a G rating. I'll tell ya, I think that the MPAA needs a rating themselves. That would be an 'F'. Rest assured, Superman - Doomsday is definitely for kids too unless you shield your kids from the same kinds of intensity that can be found in the most intense chapters of Nemo and other Disney G-rated classics.Now, on the other side of the coin...Doomsday does viciously do away with some of the folks that cross his path. So a little Parental Guidance could be in order for kids 7 and under. But any 10 year old that needs Parental Guidance for Superman - Doomsday doesn't get out much.Superman - Doomsday isn't quite as well put together as theJustice League)series, but it was pretty good. I don't follow the comic book series, but I understand that there are some continuity issues between this movie and the DC Comics...most notably the origin of Doomsday. But the story told on the DVD held up, and was pretty cool.LexCorp's minions find an alien craft in some mine and accidentally unleash Doomsday (an ugly looking monster) from the craft. The monster wreaks havoc; Superman comes to the rescue; and the result could be a dramatic change in a World that is used to having Superman around to protect everyone.It is not necessary to have ever seen a Justice League episode or read a DC Superman comic book to enjoy the Superman - Doomsday DVD. On the contrary...familiarity with the comic books or TV series might hinder your viewing pleasure based on the varying continuity factors.Final word: sit back and enjoy. And don't forget to provide that all-important Parental Guidance for the kids that have never seen the 6 o'clock news.",3,Rating Superman,1194912000,"11 13, 2007",2007,2179,"['wife', 'fun', 'shushing', 'kids', 'can', 'hear', 'cartoons', 'quickly', 'correct', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'not', ""'cartoon"", ""'animated"", 'feature', 'film', 'clarification', 'reason', 'always', 'bring', 'even', 'more', 'chuckles', 'bottle', 'wine', 'friends', 'clarify', 'matter.Anyway', 'My', 'kids', 'were', 'as', 'captivated', 'was', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'What', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'remember', 'couple', 'scenes', 'inFinding', 'were', 'more', 'intense', 'young', 'children', 'Nemo', 'G', 'rating', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'ya', 'think', 'MPAA', 'rating', 'would', 'be', 'F', 'Rest', 'assured', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'definitely', 'kids', 'too', 'shield', 'kids', 'same', 'kinds', 'intensity', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'most', 'intense', 'chapters', 'Nemo', 'other', 'Disney', 'G-rated', 'classics.Now', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'Doomsday', 'viciously', 'do', 'away', 'folks', 'cross', 'path', 'little', 'Parental', 'Guidance', 'could', 'be', 'order', 'kids', '7', '10', 'year', 'old', 'Parental', 'Guidance', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', ""n't"", 'get', 'out', 'much.Superman', 'Doomsday', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'theJustice', 'League', 'series', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'understand', 'are', 'continuity', 'issues', 'movie', 'DC', 'Comics', 'most', 'notably', 'origin', 'Doomsday', 'story', 'told', 'DVD', 'held', 'up', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool.LexCorp', 'minions', 'find', 'alien', 'craft', 'mine', 'accidentally', 'unleash', 'Doomsday', 'ugly', 'looking', 'monster', 'craft', 'monster', 'havoc', 'Superman', 'rescue', 'result', 'could', 'be', 'dramatic', 'change', 'World', 'used', 'having', 'Superman', 'protect', 'everyone.It', 'not', 'necessary', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Justice', 'League', 'episode', 'read', 'DC', 'Superman', 'comic', 'book', 'enjoy', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'DVD', 'contrary', 'familiarity', 'comic', 'books', 'TV', 'series', 'might', 'hinder', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'based', 'varying', 'continuity', 'factors.Final', 'word', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'provide', 'all-important', 'Parental', 'Guidance', 'kids', 'have', 'never', 'seen', '6', ""o'clock"", 'news']",Superman: Doomsday

I knew with Duane Capizzi writing, the man responsible for Superman:Brainiac Attacks, that could mean trouble.  Except I held out hope, knowing that the source material he was adapting it from was good, and that Bruce Timm was on board to steer this in the right direction.Now I understand full well that this story is not connected to the DCAU, and is a stand alone movie, but I still can't help wishing they had stuck with the original voice actors.  They just couldn't resist casting name actors to draw more fans in I suppose and while Adam Baldwin is an ok Superman, Anne Heche doesn't hold a candle to Dana Delaney's Lois, and I won't even get started on the downgrade with Luthor.

I understand from being at the q&a; panel that the idea was to condense the story, make it simpler, and let it stand alone as just a Superman story.  The idea sounds ok in theory, but it just makes the movie feel cheap, like we're getting the cliff's notes version when I'd rather be seeing the unabridged epic with a full story of supporting characters.  I was really hoping to see a cliffhanger ending, something to indicate that this is not the end, but alas there was no Empire Strikes Back moment to relish in.The animation doesn't stray too much from Timm's style, which is visually pleasing but makes the fact that the voices are radically different that much more irritating.  I will say that the fight between Supes and Doomsday is really something.  That alone is worth two stars.  Just the right length and even more brutal than the fight they had in JLU.  I will watch it again just for that.There's a few other surprises and character moments to behold that are enjoyable.  I just can't help imagining what it could have been had they done it right and adapted the entire story as opposed to giving us a taste test of one of the most definitive Superman stories ever told.",2,"I wanted to like it, I really did",1188345600,"08 29, 2007",2007,2184,"['Being', 'longtime', 'DCAU', 'fan', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'knew', 'Duane', 'Capizzi', 'writing', 'man', 'responsible', 'Superman', 'Brainiac', 'Attacks', 'could', 'mean', 'trouble', 'held', 'out', 'hope', 'knowing', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'adapting', 'was', 'good', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'was', 'board', 'steer', 'right', 'direction.Now', 'understand', 'full', 'well', 'story', 'not', 'connected', 'DCAU', 'stand', 'alone', 'movie', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wishing', 'had', 'stuck', 'original', 'voice', 'actors', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'casting', 'name', 'actors', 'draw', 'more', 'fans', 'suppose', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'ok', 'Superman', 'Anne', 'Heche', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'Dana', 'Delaney', 'Lois', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'downgrade', 'Luthor', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'considering', 'Andrea', 'Romano', 'voice', 'casting', 'usually', 'spot', 'on.But', 'enough', 'actors', 'biggest', 'problem', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'three', 'great', 'movies', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'sub', 'par', 'movie', 'understand', 'being', 'q', 'panel', 'idea', 'was', 'condense', 'story', 'make', 'simpler', 'let', 'stand', 'alone', 'as', 'just', 'Superman', 'story', 'idea', 'ok', 'theory', 'just', 'movie', 'feel', 'cheap', ""'re"", 'getting', 'cliff', 'notes', 'version', 'when', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'seeing', 'unabridged', 'epic', 'full', 'story', 'supporting', 'characters', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'see', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'something', 'indicate', 'not', 'end', 'was', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'moment', 'relish', 'in.The', 'animation', ""n't"", 'stray', 'too', 'much', 'Timm', 'style', 'visually', 'pleasing', 'fact', 'voices', 'are', 'radically', 'different', 'much', 'more', 'irritating', 'will', 'say', 'fight', 'Supes', 'Doomsday', 'really', 'something', 'alone', 'worth', 'two', 'stars', 'Just', 'right', 'length', 'even', 'more', 'brutal', 'fight', 'had', 'JLU', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'just', 'few', 'other', 'surprises', 'character', 'moments', 'behold', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'imagining', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'done', 'right', 'adapted', 'entire', 'story', 'opposed', 'giving', 'taste', 'test', 'one', 'most', 'definitive', 'Superman', 'stories', 'ever', 'told']",Superman: Doomsday

1070222,A1ZIFOTJ2Q9YYB,B000PE0G0A,"S. VALE ""Rabbi Steve the Storyteller""","[2, 8]","This review is from: Superman: Doomsday (DVD)The problem with many of these low-rated reviews (not all), is that many of the reviewers who give poor reviews are either fans of the wonderful DC Universe series that have already come out (and I love all of the Bruce Timm and company created series: BATMAN, SUPERMAN, JUSTICE LEAGUE and even the criminally underrated, BATMAN BEYOND) or comic book fans. Or in some cases, both.I am both and I loved this DVD! I will watch the movie more than once (at least once more with the creator commentary) and I am sure enjoy it each time.And I think there are a lot of people who are neither, who either know Superman from one of the live-action series, from the movies or just from memories of reading the comics as kids or maybe even the old ""Super Friends"" shows (or even worse animated series featuring the Man of Steel). Many of those people will also enjoy this (but some of them will also have to leave their preconceptions at the door).Make no mistake: this is a ONE-SHOT RETELLING of an epic story INSPIRED by an almost ""stand-alone"" story arc in a regular comic book series. ""Inspired"", not a total recreation. I like that. For me, that is a strength in this film.I think that if people can both read and watch these stories as ""legends"" retold, it allows much more leeway for the creator as well as for the viewer.I was not thrilled with the animation model for Superman at first, because of the lines on his face, but I quickly got used to that and got caught up in the story. And that is just about my only negative! Certainly not enough for me to rate it less than 4 and half stars at least.No, this is NOT the exact same story from the graphic novel. No, there are no other super heroes in this one-shot universe--it is not connected to the continuity of the other DCU series, nor any other movie or comic book.What this is, is similar in my mind to what Peter Jackson does in both the LORD OF THE RINGS and KING KONG. He is a storyteller and he tells HIS version of great stories.That is what Bruce Timm and company did here: they tell their version of a great story. And this version more than survives the retelling: it THRIVES!The writing is strong and to the point, the voice acting is very,very good: I like all the new voices. I thought Adam Baldwin did a great Superman, and James Marsters' Lex Luthor was good and evil. I even liked Ann Heche as Lois and I was set to NOT like her (I usually don't like her acting much).The animation is a different style than the rest of the DCU animation, but the style they used here was fine and set this movie apart as the one shot it is supposed to be.I know that many fans of the comic book series (and/or the animated DCU) miss or will miss the rest of the Justice League, the other ""Supermen"" that were part of the comic book graphic novel, etc. Or they will feel that other things were added that ""did not belong"" (as if there is some kind of ""religious canon"" to this material that prevents other storytellers to add and subtract what they need or want to to tell the story!).I feel that in many cases, this is a lack of imagination based on either too much attachment to previous versions of a story or just lack of imagination in general.This is a very entertaining, and I dare say even inspiring retelling of an epic story. For those who can put preconceptions aside and watch the whole movie (I think anyone who reviews a movie based on watching 10 minutes is not playing fair, unless there is something in the movie that is offensive or hurtful that prevents that), I think they will enjoy this. The special feature on the creation of the original comic book series, ""THE DEATH OF SUPERMAN"" is almost worth the price of this DVD alone (at least for me, but what do I know I am a comic book geek! Yes, I admit it!).One more small caveat: THIS IS NOT FOR SMALL CHILDREN! It has a well-earned PG13 rating. There is some blood, lots of people die (albeit often off-screen, but even then, the sound-effects make it bone-crushingly clear what is happening), there are sexual references (mild, but definitely PG13) and other things that make this film for older children, teens, and adults.My wife and I both enjoyed it very much. I am looking forward to more DC one shots like this. I think it gives the creators a lot of leeway to really shine and do what they do best, be creative (not simply repeat either what they have already done or what others have done).There are a lot of cool trailers, and at least nice three special features that I like a lot (I can do without the little game: these games are always too me a waste of information space).P.S. We wanted to like the Marvel Animated feature: ULTIMATE AVENGERS, but that was no where near as good as this.

1070229,A3M7RECGYLXOPA,B000PE0G0A,The Wickerman,"[1, 2]","This was a really nice surprise for me.  I watched it not really expecting much of anything, but this is a really exciting and well-written animated movie.  Based loosely upon the ""death of Superman"" issues of the comics, it is a retelling of the Man of Steel's untimely demise following his epic battle with Doomsday.  There are many discrepancies from the comic, particularly Doomsday's origins, and the fight is considerably scaled down, but the fight sequence between them is still spectacular.I was a bit disappointed at first to find that Doomsday is actually a smaller part of this story than you might think.  However, that disappointment is short-lived, because the rest of the story is fantastic as well.  As you might guess, Superman's death is only temporary and soon he's back in action, but it's quickly apparent that things are not what they seem.Overall, this is just a really great story, especially considering it's ""only a cartoon"".  I found myself more than once wishing this were live action, because that really would have been amazing.  Still, as it is, this is easily up there with most of the live action superhero movies made recently (and it's WAY better than ""Superman Returns"").  I really like the sort of ""oldschool"" animation, that is, not computer generated.  You don't really see this kind of thing that much these days, which is kind of sad, in my opinion.  This animation style reminds me very much of the cartoons I used to watch as a kid.  However, it should be noted that this is NOT for kids.  With a PG-13 rating, it is considerably darker and more violent than any Superman cartoon I've seen.  Plus, there's a bit of mild language and a more mature and emotionally complex story than what you might expect.The voiceover work is great as well.  Adam Baldwin has the Superman voice down perfectly, and Anne Heche is a surprisingly good Lois Lane.  James Marsters, who of course plays Brainiac on ""Smallville"", this time provides the voice of Lex Luthor, and his performance is spot-on as well.  Other vocal talents include Ray Wise, Adam Wylie, Cree Summer, and there's even a funny cameo from Kevin Smith.If there's one thing here that didn't really work for me, it's Superman's goofy robot butler, which was really just cheesy and probably unnecesary.  I guess it did provide some comic relief to an otherwise dark story, but I don't know, I could have done without it.

1070233,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000PE0G0A,Tim Janson,"[0, 0]","The Death of Superman was perhaps the greatest publicity stunt in comic book history. We comic fans knew that Superman would never truly be dead but the event did what it set out to do...garner world-wide media attention and sell a gazillion copies. The story itself is hardly a classic. Doomsday was some character cooked up in a meeting with various DC artists and writers. He would not even get an origin until several years later. It's interesting to note that while watching the documentary on the comic event, the story might not have ever taken place if DC had not been forced to push back the wedding of Superman and Lois Lane because Warner Bros. wanted the even to first happen on the old Lois & Clark TV show. With their plots for the year having to be shelved, the Superman team hatched the ultimate plot...""let's just kill `im!""The story of Superman's death and return was played out over dozens of comic issues in all four Superman titles. So obviously in a 75 minute movie a lot had to be condensed or lost entirely. Doomsday is accidentally released from his prison deep beneath the Earth's surface by employees of Lexcorp who are illegally mining. Doomsday immediately goes on a rampage, killing all of the Lexcorp employees (hence the PG-13 rating) and heads for Metropolis. One of the story elements from the comics that was dropped was Doomsday's battle with the Justice League. This is a solo Superman adventure which disappointed me because I was looking forward to seeing Booster Gold (the dumbest Superhero in history) get trounced on the small screen.The climactic battle between Superman and Doomsday maintains that bigger than life feel of the comics. You may recall that the final battle was told entirely in splash pages. Here the scope is just as big as entire buildings crumble straight down in a scene eerily similar to the Twin Towers on 9/11. I won't give away the hows, the death scene was handled much more dramatically than the double-knockout of the comic. Now it's important to note that this all happens in about the first half hour so more than half the film focuses on life in metropolis after Superman's death, and his eventual return. Again, owing to limited time, we get the appearance of a man who claims to be Superman. What the writers essentially did was take the idea behind the Superboy clone, the evil Cyborg Superman, and the Eradicator Superman and meld them all together. This Superman soon appears but Lois immediately knows something isn't quite right about him.The one aspect of the film that most disappointed me was the part Lex Luthor played in it. While Lex had little to do with the story in the comics, here's he's given a central role. We've had five big screen Superman films and now one animated film and Lex Luthor has played a main role in all but Superman III. In as much as an animated film is going to appeal much more to a core comic fan audience, I would have liked to have seen the writers be a little more creative than falling back on Lex Luthor as the main villain again.The animation is only average, and honestly, probably not as good as the Superman animated series or the Justice League. Supes had these two lines on either side of his face to define his cheekbones but they never moved with his expressions so they ended up looking more like scars. Weird! The voice talent on the other hand was very good. Adam Baldwin did a find job as Superman as did James Marsters as Lex Luthor.What really brings my grade of the DVD up are the special features. There is a 45 minute documentary ""Requiem and Rebirth: Superman Lives!"" which is truly outstanding. This film details the entire process of the creation of the comic story featuring comments by writers and artists: Louise Simonson, Roger Stern, Dan Jurgens, Jerry Ordway, Jon Bogdanove, Brett Breeding, Paul Levitz, and former publisher Jeanette Kahn. While they deny doing the story as a publicity event, I can't deny the sincerity that they put into the story. It seems even they were surprised at what a media stir the event caused. The movie itself is good...not great, but the DVD package is worth it for the historical documentary.REVIEWED BY TIM JANSON",3,IT'S NOT THE COMIC BUT DOES A FAIR JOB,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,4192,"['Death', 'Superman', 'was', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'publicity', 'stunt', 'comic', 'book', 'history', 'comic', 'fans', 'knew', 'Superman', 'would', 'never', 'truly', 'be', 'dead', 'event', 'did', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'garner', 'world-wide', 'media', 'attention', 'sell', 'gazillion', 'copies', 'story', 'hardly', 'classic', 'Doomsday', 'was', 'character', 'cooked', 'up', 'meeting', 'various', 'DC', 'artists', 'writers', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'get', 'origin', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'interesting', 'note', 'watching', 'documentary', 'comic', 'event', 'story', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'ever', 'taken', 'place', 'DC', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'forced', 'push', 'back', 'wedding', 'Superman', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'wanted', 'even', 'first', 'happen', 'old', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'TV', 'show', 'plots', 'year', 'having', 'be', 'shelved', 'Superman', 'team', 'hatched', 'ultimate', 'plot', 'let', 'just', 'kill', 'im', 'story', 'Superman', 'death', 'return', 'was', 'played', 'out', 'dozens', 'comic', 'issues', 'four', 'Superman', 'titles', 'So', 'obviously', '75', 'minute', 'movie', 'lot', 'had', 'be', 'condensed', 'lost', 'entirely', 'Doomsday', 'accidentally', 'released', 'prison', 'deep', 'Earth', 'surface', 'employees', 'Lexcorp', 'who', 'are', 'illegally', 'mining', 'Doomsday', 'immediately', 'rampage', 'killing', 'Lexcorp', 'employees', 'hence', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'heads', 'Metropolis', 'One', 'story', 'elements', 'comics', 'was', 'dropped', 'was', 'Doomsday', 'battle', 'Justice', 'League', 'solo', 'Superman', 'adventure', 'disappointed', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Booster', 'Gold', 'dumbest', 'Superhero', 'history', 'get', 'trounced', 'small', 'screen.The', 'climactic', 'battle', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'bigger', 'life', 'feel', 'comics', 'may', 'recall', 'final', 'battle', 'was', 'told', 'entirely', 'splash', 'pages', 'Here', 'scope', 'just', 'as', 'big', 'entire', 'buildings', 'crumble', 'straight', 'down', 'scene', 'eerily', 'similar', 'Twin', 'Towers', '9/11', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'hows', 'death', 'scene', 'was', 'handled', 'much', 'more', 'dramatically', 'double-knockout', 'comic', 'Now', 'important', 'note', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'more', 'film', 'life', 'metropolis', 'Superman', 'death', 'eventual', 'return', 'Again', 'owing', 'limited', 'time', 'get', 'appearance', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'Superman', 'What', 'writers', 'essentially', 'did', 'was', 'take', 'idea', 'Superboy', 'clone', 'evil', 'Cyborg', 'Superman', 'Eradicator', 'Superman', 'meld', 'together', 'Superman', 'soon', 'Lois', 'immediately', 'something', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'him.The', 'one', 'aspect', 'film', 'most', 'disappointed', 'was', 'part', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'played', 'Lex', 'had', 'little', 'do', 'story', 'comics', 'here', 'given', 'central', 'role', ""'ve"", 'had', 'five', 'big', 'screen', 'Superman', 'films', 'now', 'one', 'animated', 'film', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'played', 'main', 'role', 'Superman', 'III', 'as', 'much', 'animated', 'film', 'going', 'appeal', 'much', 'more', 'core', 'comic', 'fan', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'writers', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'creative', 'falling', 'back', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'main', 'villain', 'again.The', 'animation', 'only', 'average', 'honestly', 'probably', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Superman', 'animated', 'series', 'Justice', 'League', 'Supes', 'had', 'two', 'lines', 'side', 'face', 'define', 'cheekbones', 'never', 'moved', 'expressions', 'ended', 'up', 'looking', 'more', 'scars', 'Weird', 'voice', 'talent', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'did', 'find', 'job', 'as', 'Superman', 'did', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Lex', 'Luthor.What', 'really', 'grade', 'DVD', 'up', 'are', 'special', 'features', '45', 'minute', 'documentary', 'Requiem', 'Rebirth', 'Superman', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'film', 'details', 'entire', 'process', 'creation', 'comic', 'story', 'featuring', 'comments', 'writers', 'artists', 'Louise', 'Simonson', 'Roger', 'Stern', 'Dan', 'Jurgens', 'Jerry', 'Ordway', 'Jon', 'Bogdanove', 'Brett', 'Breeding', 'Paul', 'Levitz', 'former', 'publisher', 'Jeanette', 'Kahn', 'deny', 'doing', 'story', 'publicity', 'event', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'sincerity', 'put', 'story', 'even', 'were', 'surprised', 'what', 'media', 'stir', 'event', 'caused', 'movie', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'DVD', 'package', 'historical', 'documentary.REVIEWED', 'BY', 'TIM', 'JANSON']",Superman: Doomsday

It was a very short period of just about a year that ended when DC announced that Superman would be killed.The creature that brought about the ultimate battle was a completely nihilistic character named Doomsday a creature that couldn't be killed and could only ""feel"" hate.  The comic where Superman died sold more comics in one day than any other comic book in history had done up to that point.  Of course, the whole story line also was a major factor in the eventual demise of much of the comic book industry, something the industry has only started to recover from in the past few years.SUPERMAN DOOMSDAY is a direct-to-DVD title that attempts to compress the entire Death of Superman saga into a simple, easy-to-follow storyline that runs for a bit less than 90 minutes.  The movie follows the very basics of the Death of Superman saga: Doomsday's ""discovery"" below the Earth, the fight between Superman and Doomsday in Metropolis, and (of course) the death of Superman. However, there's a large chunk of the Death of Superman story that has been exercised from this movie. For instance, there's no eradication of the Justice League, no Reign of the Supermen, etc.Direct-to-DVD animated titles tend to not have as quality animation as theatrical releases.  However, this wasn't a typical direct-to-DVD.  It was heavily marketed and promoted and I can't help but feel some of that marketing money would have been better spent in getting better quality animation.  In my opinion, it most closely resembles the animation of the Superman cartoon shorts of the 1930s and 1940s.SUPERMAN DOOMSDAY isn't a terrible animated movie. However, it's not great either.  Comic book purists probably won't like the film and though the movie has a larger appeal than many other titles, there aren't a lot of people who aren't already familiar with Superman that are going to watch this movie.",3,The Day That Superman Died,1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,1965,"['was', 'brief', 'time', 'life', 'when', 'collected', 'comics', 'semi-regular', 'basis', 'was', 'very', 'short', 'period', 'just', 'year', 'ended', 'when', 'DC', 'announced', 'Superman', 'would', 'be', 'killed.The', 'creature', 'brought', 'ultimate', 'battle', 'was', 'completely', 'nihilistic', 'character', 'named', 'Doomsday', 'creature', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'killed', 'could', 'only', 'feel', 'hate', 'comic', 'where', 'Superman', 'died', 'sold', 'more', 'comics', 'one', 'day', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'history', 'had', 'done', 'up', 'point', 'course', 'whole', 'story', 'line', 'also', 'was', 'major', 'factor', 'eventual', 'demise', 'much', 'comic', 'book', 'industry', 'something', 'industry', 'only', 'started', 'recover', 'past', 'few', 'years.SUPERMAN', 'DOOMSDAY', 'direct-to-DVD', 'title', 'compress', 'entire', 'Death', 'Superman', 'saga', 'simple', 'easy-to-follow', 'storyline', 'bit', 'less', '90', 'minutes', 'movie', 'very', 'basics', 'Death', 'Superman', 'saga', 'Doomsday', 'discovery', 'Earth', 'fight', 'Superman', 'Doomsday', 'Metropolis', 'course', 'death', 'Superman', 'However', 'large', 'chunk', 'Death', 'Superman', 'story', 'been', 'exercised', 'movie', 'instance', 'eradication', 'Justice', 'League', 'Reign', 'Supermen', 'etc.Direct-to-DVD', 'animated', 'titles', 'tend', 'not', 'have', 'quality', 'animation', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'However', 'was', ""n't"", 'typical', 'direct-to-DVD', 'was', 'heavily', 'marketed', 'promoted', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'marketing', 'money', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'spent', 'getting', 'better', 'quality', 'animation', 'opinion', 'most', 'closely', 'animation', 'Superman', 'cartoon', 'shorts', '1930s', '1940s.SUPERMAN', 'DOOMSDAY', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'animated', 'movie', 'However', 'not', 'great', 'either', 'Comic', 'book', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'movie', 'larger', 'appeal', 'many', 'other', 'titles', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'already', 'familiar', 'Superman', 'are', 'going', 'watch', 'movie']",Superman: Doomsday

After spending so much time on creating the television sensation of the DC Animated Universe it was obviously time to move to the next stage. Superman Doomsday, created in the tradition of Batman:Mask of the Phantasm and Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker is exactly where we are heading.Superman Doomsday while not entirley accurate is a film version of one of the most shocking and most talked about moments in the history of Comic Books. The Death of Superman from the arrival of Doomsday all the way to the triumphant return of the Man of Steel brought an entire world of fans to their knees and many a tears were shead when one of the most beloved characters in pop culture went through such a dark and turbulant story. Bruce Timm really tried to capture the main meat of this story and really holding true to the main points of this entire saga.Most of the complaints are the battle between Superman and Doomsday is too short and very shallow. I being 10 years old reading that issue remebered it as being just that nothing but one issue and a huge slugfest leading up to Superman's death. The four supermen before the return of the real one. The evil superman was pretty much a conglomorate of all four of them just leaving the viewer not as confused as he or she could have been epscially since probably most of the these viewers didn't actually follow the real story in print.The possitives of this film was the fact that Bruce Timms story telling didn't hold back. Given a PG-13 rating allowed the story's violent and emotional parts be hard to watch and times hard to bear as it was to read the story. The animation as well as the voice actors used can go either way. I understood after watching the special features that this movie was made in this style to capture the mood and feel of the origional story and the voice actors used in the origional shows may not have been able to really show the emotions or feelings needed for such powerful moments seen in the movie. My real beef in this story was the part that was based on Funeral for a Friend. I hated the fact that this movie only featured Superman and Superman characters at the funeral. After a show like Justice League, people really should have seen the impact that the death of Superman had on the other heroes of the DC universe.

1070247,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000PE0G0A,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[4, 6]","Thank you, Amazon, for the quick delivery! I got my order for this dvd yesterday.I'm a comic book fan, I actually own the ""Death and return of Superman"" in its original comic crossover form. This event in comic history was very significant (while it lasted) in the early 1990's because of the repercussions throughout the DC universe. Now, more than 10 years later, we see this event in animated form. Is it as significant? Honestly, for me, not really.LEXCORP has organized a dig to find a new source of energy from the Earth's core. Accidentally, they unearth the buried ship of a monster called Doomsday. A killing machine created from the genetic labs of Krypton from the past. A being so powerful, he rampages through the U.S. until he reaches Metropolis. Superman gives his all to stop the monster at a terrible price. .All of Metropolis mourns its hero, even Lex Luthor, who mourns the passing of the last son of Krypton in his own twisted and sinister way.At first glance, I thought this animated movie was going to be reminiscent of the Superman animated series in the 90's. But no, this is a stand-alone movie unrelated to either the fantastic ""Justice League"" and the Superman animated series. In this movie, Superman is the only super-hero on Earth; Lois didn't know beforehand that Clark was Superman before they had an intimate relationship. You might say that Superman was the real person and Clark was only a disguise. This fact was changed before by John Byrne who marvelously developed the Clark Kent persona.The movie is not perfect, but at least it felt more geared towards the Teen-Adult demography than kids below 12. The brawl with Doomsday was very intense, there is some blood and it shows (almost) as much PG-13 brutality as it can spare. The atmosphere and the story are quite darker than we are usually used to when dealing with ""DC animated"" features. Imagine a being with Superman's powers that was raised by Luthor. The film also has some mildly ""sexy"" moments between Kal-El and Lois, and a titillation moment between Lois and Lex. You might say that these moments proved that animated features as well as comics are changing with the times. Children are no longer the main demographic to animated super-hero movies.To its credit, the film will be able to hold the audience's attention for the most part, there are some plot holes but who cares, right? It's a cartoon even though it runs for almost 2 hours. No one can make a very detailed feature with superman's death and return in those few minutes.The animation/art was very good, although I can't get over the cheekbones in Supes' face and the big line from Lex's head to his cheeks. Nice rendering with the Lois Lane, though. Martha Kent makes an appearance, I'm sorry to say no Jonathan Kent was present.PRESENTATION: Very cool lenticular collectible cover.VIDEO/AUDIO: 1.78 anamorphic widescreen. Nice transfer, sharp and radiant with solid blacks throughout the animation. 5.1 Dolby digital sound is very crisp.EXTRAS: Making of features, trailers, ""Justice League: New Frontier"" featurette and more.Final thoughts:As a comic book fan/collector, I find this animated feature decent enough to do Superman justice and add to his legendary annals in pop culture. It is a fresh look at the ""Death and return of Superman""! It brought back memories...Recommended!

Then you have a writer come along and think they can do a better job at telling the story, and you end up with this garbage.First of all, the Doomsday was in the movie for about ten minutes. Then it was the evil clone of Superman for the rest of the movie as the villain. So it really shouldn't have been named Superman/Doomsday.The worst part of it is, they missed so much of the essence of ""Death of Superman"" in this telling. When they first told the story, Doomsday decimated the Justice League, and left them in ruins. Superman was faced with a choice he'd never been faced with before. For the first time, he knew he had to kill Doomsday in order to save everyone. This was almost as powerful a revelation as dying--a hero realizing that sometimes the cost must be this high. Not just your life, but taking another life. It took time for Superman to have to work up to this. That was great story telling.The disappointment of this movie leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

For what it's worth the fight against this movie's Doomsday is visually impressive and properly epic. Spoiler alert... that's the first third of the movie.Rather, this movie actually isn't about Superman versus Doomsday, or at least the comic version of Doomsday. This Doomsday is merely a genetic weapon. The film, instead, is a retelling of the ""Death of Superman"" storyline. A horribly... butchered... retelling. There is no Metropolis Kid. There is no John Henry Irons. There is no Eradicator. There is no Cyborg Superman. We do get a Lex Luther clone.Fans of Superman might already be cringing... which leads into the other problem.

I don't know... everybody who wouldn't be buying the film.Much like the Wonder Woman film I just watched we get quite a bit of dialog centered around setting some characters up; while others have random plot motivation changes that occurred in the Comic Book Series take all of 10 seconds on film.
