1114897,AJASGOXDLFHR9,B000XSPGP8,Ace,"[4, 7]","Zombie aficionados have a difficult road to hoe. We KNOW that most people would consider these to be the worst films on the planet. We acknowledge the poor production values which are usually shrouded in a pall of hackneyed black comedy to hide this awful truth. We are also keenly aware that the real joke is on us for supporting most of these films, yet like moths to a flame, we are drawn to them. Being a huge Zombie film fan I was eager to screen the SD, especially after the praise fellow Amazonians had bestowed upon it, (having gleaned an average rating of four stars thus far). Boy was I disappointed.  As I listen to the gnashing of teeth and snarl of  those who have rated this film with a high score,  I must address the hypocrisy that IS part of the Zombie and  Horror community. There is NO consistency among Zombie film reviewers. My first check of a colleague's review had SD clock in at 4 stars yet the (later) DAY OF THE DEAD bottomed out at one star. AUTOMATON TRANSFUSION faired only marginally better at two stars. Cripes, the remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD yielded only three stars by a consensus of Amazon customers and Romero's DAY OF THE DEAD was tied at 4 stars, and that was for the Divimax edition! In reality, all of these films blow the SPECIAL DEAD away. Yes I am aware that the Amazon polls are not truly scientific, yet the trend here speaks volumes. As this is a lower budget indie film I have adjusted my expectations, so I won't be comparing it to THE EXORCIST. That said, what should our benchmark or blood red standard be? Even if we by-pass all of the above, what film would you choose? What would be a reasonable acid test to ensure that we are comparing ""eyeballs to eyeballs"" in order to give fellow readers a more consistent score? Let us first find a film that epitomizes the low budget indie zombie or quasi-zombie genre and then use that as a point of comparison. Sure, this is not a perfect solution, but it is a start. One plausible comparison is with The EVIL DEAD, an old chestnut now well over a quarter of a century old. As testament to its greatness this represents the The Holy Grail of such films. The EVIL DEAD also has a similar pedigree, yet the film makers accomplished so much more, (that I am sure all would agree). Why then did the EVIL DEAD only edge the SD by a half star rating??? The SD is a poorly executed zombie splatter film aimed at a juvenile level. The acting is poor though due to the characterizations of the handicapped it is sometimes a difficult call. Most of the night shots are full of grain, with some almost giving the impression that the film was solarized. Needless to say, the plot, dialogue and scoring were also below par. The film is laden with brutal Horror Comedy elements almost too painful to watch, (but this is some people's idea of a good time). If you can't pull this off then keep it dark. Heavy Metal music also abounds, (which I love), but it is now quite pedestrian in many Zombie flicks. Wait, there is also rap mixed into the SD soundtrack! WTF? Gag me with a spoon. The Zombies themselves were OK, and I was glad to see that they were of the Stage 3 variety, (though they were nothing to write home about either). Contrary to what other reviewers have reported the gore is NOT over the top. Yep, there was a lot of theatrical blood on hand, but not as much all out gore. There are some fair scenes, but much of this is marred by spotty cinematography. Curiously, some of the daytime shots were quite professional looking. Perhaps this was intentional but it was distracting. As Zombie fans what do we want most of all? We want to see CARNAGE. End of story. So do it well and don't tease us. Although there was a ""stab"" at it, there was not enough quality Zombie chow time in this flick! I am tired of viewing substandard films especially when I know that the producers could have done better, (as in this case). Not to everyone's standards so I won't complain if you do LIKE it. Just don't try and justify the outrageous scoring that it has unfortunately received. Strive for consistency people!

1114901,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000XSPGP8,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[10, 13]","I've been dying to see this movie since I first heard of it late last year.  Sure, we could talk all day about just how ""wrong"" this movie is, but why not sit back, toss those bunched-up PC panties aside for a freaking hour and a half, and enjoy the heck out of this hilarious zombie movie already enjoying a cult following.  And for what it's worth, name me one other movie that transforms the mentally challenged into heroes.  That's what I thought.  Anyway, Special Dead is just hilarious, not only milking numerous stereotypes for all they're worth, but kicking them once they're proverbially down.  The zombies are just downright disgusting, their grey skin peeling off in bunches, their mouths filled with meat, blood, dirt, and heaven knows what else, and their blood just waiting to shoot out in mini-geysers as soon as they're attacked.  I don't know what the chicken-eating zombie was actually eating, but it looked even nastier than the real thing.  Low-budget horror filmmakers could learn a lot from watching this movie.  Even the soundtrack, featuring the likes of Dark Reign and Eating Alice, is pretty kicking - although nothing tops Andy Allen's unique campfire song (there's even a sing-along version before the ending credits).As the tagline says, ""Sometimes heroes ride the short bus,"" and in this case they ride it to Camp Special Dude owned and operated by Cameron ""Snuff"" Stone (Larrs Jackson, who was just hilarious, especially on the topic of zombie horses), who bought the camp years ago for a song - because, we soon learn, it was infested with zombies.  Snuff's second in command is his son Machiavelli ""Mack"" Stone (Jason Brubaker).  Mack only seems to care about making time with female counselors Cassie (Amy Wade) and Harley (Haneka Haynes), but he turns out to have real skills when it comes to dispatching zombies.  The ""special"" kids include Snuff's wheelchair-bound daughter Dale (Gia Franzia); Todd (Anthony Rutowicz), whose loud talking, hideous toboggan, and talent for making all kinds of things out of popsicle sticks do little to help him convince Dale to be his girlfriend; an uncommunicative mountain of flesh who could well be descended from Tor Johnson (David Reynolds); a shy ""helmet head"" (April Wade); and several others of less importance to the story.  Adding greatly to the fun is Eriq (Jah Shams), a young gangster bound for boot camp who was accidentally placed on the wrong bus.  All of the actors were darn near brilliant, if you ask me (especially Franzia and Rutowicz).Don't write any of these characters off too soon, not even the most challenged among them.  While guys like Mack rely mostly on obvious weapons such as shotguns, sickles, numchuks - yes, numchuks - and good, old-fashioned bare fists, the campers tend to adopt more unconventional fighting methods.  Of course, not everyone can survive, so you get the additional treat of watching special campers taking on their now-zombified peers.  You may want to turn your head at one point, though, as Mack demonstrates a most disgusting, non-lethal zombie-controlling method.Now, maybe you're thinking you won't see any sex or nudity in a film like this - well, think again.  You, along with some of the voyeuristic campers, will definitely see ""boobies"" at Camp Special Dude.  You'll also hear plenty of foul language (of course, if I were fighting for my life against zombies, I would be cursing up a blue streak, too).  For the most part, though, this is a genuinely original and creative film (a real rarity in the American-made horror genre).  Just remember that everything you see here is all in the name of gory fun.  Where else are you going to see a zombie with Tourette Syndrome?  Needless to say, some people will feel deeply offended and outraged by this film (and most of them will undoubtedly condemn it without ever seeing so much as a trailer), but Special Dead wears such sobriquets as ""the most offensive zombie movie ever made"" with pride.  I'll be enjoying this movie numerous times in the coming years.",5,An instant cult classic,1212278400,"06 1, 2008",2008,4039,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'dying', 'see', 'movie', 'first', 'heard', 'late', 'last', 'year', 'Sure', 'could', 'talk', 'day', 'just', 'how', 'wrong', 'movie', 'why', 'not', 'sit', 'back', 'bunched-up', 'PC', 'panties', 'aside', 'freaking', 'hour', 'half', 'enjoy', 'heck', 'hilarious', 'zombie', 'movie', 'already', 'enjoying', 'cult', 'following', 'what', 'worth', 'name', 'one', 'other', 'movie', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'heroes', 'what', 'thought', 'Anyway', 'Special', 'Dead', 'just', 'hilarious', 'not', 'only', 'milking', 'numerous', 'stereotypes', ""'re"", 'worth', 'kicking', 'once', ""'re"", 'proverbially', 'down', 'zombies', 'are', 'just', 'downright', 'disgusting', 'grey', 'skin', 'peeling', 'off', 'bunches', 'mouths', 'filled', 'meat', 'blood', 'dirt', 'heaven', 'what', 'else', 'blood', 'just', 'waiting', 'shoot', 'out', 'mini-geysers', 'as', 'soon', ""'re"", 'attacked', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'chicken-eating', 'zombie', 'was', 'actually', 'eating', 'looked', 'even', 'nastier', 'real', 'thing', 'Low-budget', 'horror', 'filmmakers', 'could', 'learn', 'lot', 'watching', 'movie', 'Even', 'soundtrack', 'featuring', 'likes', 'Dark', 'Reign', 'Eating', 'Alice', 'pretty', 'kicking', 'nothing', 'tops', 'Andy', 'Allen', 'unique', 'campfire', 'song', 'even', 'sing-along', 'version', 'ending', 'credits', '.As', 'tagline', 'Sometimes', 'heroes', 'ride', 'short', 'bus', 'case', 'ride', 'Camp', 'Special', 'Dude', 'owned', 'operated', 'Cameron', 'Snuff', 'Stone', 'Larrs', 'Jackson', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'topic', 'zombie', 'horses', 'who', 'bought', 'camp', 'years', 'ago', 'song', 'soon', 'learn', 'was', 'infested', 'zombies', 'Snuff', 'second', 'command', 'son', 'Machiavelli', 'Mack', 'Stone', 'Jason', 'Brubaker', 'Mack', 'only', 'care', 'making', 'time', 'female', 'counselors', 'Cassie', 'Amy', 'Wade', 'Harley', 'Haneka', 'Haynes', 'out', 'have', 'real', 'skills', 'when', 'dispatching', 'zombies', 'special', 'kids', 'include', 'Snuff', 'wheelchair-bound', 'daughter', 'Dale', 'Gia', 'Franzia', 'Todd', 'Anthony', 'Rutowicz', 'loud', 'talking', 'hideous', 'toboggan', 'talent', 'making', 'kinds', 'things', 'popsicle', 'sticks', 'do', 'little', 'help', 'convince', 'Dale', 'be', 'girlfriend', 'uncommunicative', 'mountain', 'flesh', 'who', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'descended', 'Tor', 'Johnson', 'David', 'Reynolds', 'shy', 'helmet', 'head', 'April', 'Wade', 'several', 'others', 'less', 'importance', 'story', 'Adding', 'greatly', 'fun', 'Eriq', 'Jah', 'Shams', 'young', 'gangster', 'bound', 'boot', 'camp', 'who', 'was', 'accidentally', 'placed', 'wrong', 'bus', 'actors', 'were', 'darn', 'brilliant', 'ask', 'especially', 'Franzia', 'Rutowicz', '.Do', ""n't"", 'write', 'characters', 'off', 'too', 'soon', 'not', 'even', 'most', 'challenged', 'guys', 'Mack', 'rely', 'mostly', 'obvious', 'weapons', 'such', 'shotguns', 'sickles', 'numchuks', 'yes', 'numchuks', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'bare', 'fists', 'campers', 'tend', 'adopt', 'more', 'unconventional', 'fighting', 'methods', 'course', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'survive', 'get', 'additional', 'treat', 'watching', 'special', 'campers', 'taking', 'now-zombified', 'peers', 'may', 'want', 'turn', 'head', 'one', 'point', 'though', 'Mack', 'most', 'disgusting', 'non-lethal', 'zombie-controlling', 'method.Now', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'sex', 'nudity', 'film', 'well', 'think', 'again', 'voyeuristic', 'campers', 'will', 'definitely', 'see', 'boobies', 'Camp', 'Special', 'Dude', ""'ll"", 'also', 'hear', 'plenty', 'foul', 'language', 'course', 'were', 'fighting', 'life', 'zombies', 'would', 'be', 'cursing', 'up', 'blue', 'streak', 'too', 'most', 'part', 'though', 'genuinely', 'original', 'creative', 'film', 'real', 'rarity', 'American-made', 'horror', 'genre', 'Just', 'remember', 'everything', 'see', 'here', 'name', 'gory', 'fun', 'Where', 'else', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'zombie', 'Tourette', 'Syndrome', 'Needless', 'say', 'people', 'will', 'feel', 'deeply', 'offended', 'outraged', 'film', 'most', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'condemn', 'ever', 'seeing', 'so', 'much', 'trailer', 'Special', 'Dead', 'wears', 'such', 'sobriquets', 'most', 'offensive', 'zombie', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'pride', ""'ll"", 'be', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'numerous', 'times', 'coming', 'years']",Special Dead

1114903,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000XSPGP8,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 6]","Special Dead (Thomas L. Phillips and Sean Simmons, 2006)It's official: I'm going straight to Hell. Why? Because once I started laughing at Special Dead, which took about thirty seconds, I just couldn't stop. Yes, I know it's wrong of me, and I know it's brutally hard-hearted, and all those other wonderful things. But let's face it, political correctness aside, Special Dead is just about the funniest horror spoof I've seen since Return of the Living Dead.Camp Special Dude is, as one might suspect from the name, a dude ranch for the mentally challenged. Due to a mixup, a prisoner, Eriq Eldorado (Jah Shams), has gotten shipped there by accident. But hey, it's better than jail, right? Only problem is, zombies are rising from the dead to attack campers and counselors alike. Eriq, head counselor Mac (Jason Brubaker), and Mac's sister Dale (Gia Franzia), one of the campers, head up a band of the living trying to survive a journey back to civilization.Yes, this is a basement-budget, badly-made film that's about as politically incorrect as they come, but it's hysterical from front to back. I case I haven't alluded to it enough, I'll say it again: if you are easily offended, this is not the movie for you. But if you're willing to ride it out, under the surface humor there's a surprisingly tender human drama to be found here, and for all the film's offensiveness, the differently-abled are portrayed here in no different a light than folks in most other horror films of this stripe; they can deliver snappy one-liners just as well as anyone else can, and they do. The scriptwriter uses both the challenges and strengths of his challenged characters well, and they end up being just as well-drawn (if not more so) than the rest of the cast. Sure, there are a few plot holes here and there and some stupidity that exists solely for the sake of its comedic value, but as with most comedy, the important thing is that it works, and it does here.The more I think about this movie, the more impressed I am with it.

I wasn't dissapointed.Found it by accident by typing ""retard"" in Amazon's search and this came up. Decided to check it out.The storyline is nothing unique, and the acting is expectedly bad, but you do get to see what would happen if a group of retards were attacked by zombies. Gotta say though, some of the actors DO pull off imatating a retard, complete with drool and twitches. Haven't seen anything that good sinceWhat's Eating Gilbert Grape.The make-up effects were okay. The zombies looked like they had oatmeal explode in their faces. But the blood splattering was pretty good.Overall, get this movie if you know any of the actors, or if you have a demented sense of humor like me. Rent it just to say you've seen the movie.

1114905,A2W82ICVTTYAOY,B000XSPGP8,Zombob,"[3, 6]","SPECIAL NOTE: First and foremost, this movie is VERY ""politcally INcorrect,"" so much that some people may be offended by it. It plays up on the stereotypes of individuals that are ""challenged,"" but in all fairness, ALL the characters in this movie are stock stereotypes that we have seen time and time again. If this offends you, perhaps this movie is not for you.1) ACTING: Amazingly enough, the acting in this movie is very strong. If anything, I would say that some of the dialogue the actors had to say caused more grief with the actors performances. While some of the ""special"" people in this film are stereotypes, the actors portraying them kept their performances restrained, so not to go ""over the top."" The stable of stereotypes were here in full force, i.e. the tough dude, the hot goth chick, the grizzled old veteran, the street hood and so on.2) ZOMBIES: The zombies in this one are ""Snyder Runners"" and also are capable of hiding, stalking, using weapons and lying in wait for their victims. Throughout the movie, I found it difficult to decipher what exactly would kill a zombie. Some seemed to ""die"" from stabbings, and some were killed by the ol' standby of a shot to the brain. The zombies in this one seem to ""rot"" really fast after turning. Nothing new is really brought to the zombies, concerning how they act, respond, kill or anything.3) PRODUCTION: While the majority of the movie was set at night, the people behind this knew how to light a scene, and make sure that the viewer could see what was going on. Some movies that film at night provide no light source and the viewer really has no clue as to what is happening. The only complaint I had was that I noticed a few times during the ""night scenes"" was that the film would take on a ""grainy"" type texture while watching it. And the best part was that it didn't look like it was filmed on a camcorder. Because this was almost a parody of zombie films, I will let the producers off the hook for the heavy metal soundtrack that always played during a zombie attack.4) SPECIAL EFFECTS: Blood and gore galore! Very much over the top! If someone received a paper cut in this movie, they would've been covered with 3 gallons of blood! The usual bag of ""innards"" from the local butcher shop were used for body parts, but instead of 1 bag, they used 25 bags! The zombie make up consisted of various stages of ""rot"" and at times, seemed like layers of mud had been applied to the actors' faces.5) NUDITY: Very minimal considering all the sex that was going on with the counselours. The actress portraying Cassie does have a nice pair of [...] and lets you have a good long look at them!6) THE CAUSE: Apparently, there is an infected well nearby that causes instant ""zombification"" when you drink it. Part of the backstory, (which is revealed near the beginning) is that the guy that owns the Special Dude Ranch got the land real cheap because of a PREVIOUS zombie attack. Zombies are an accepted part of life in this movie. There is no disbelief that a zombie attack is happening. No real reason is given as to why the water in this abandoned well causes one to turn into a zombie though, other than the brief little backstory of a previous zombie attack.Overall, I did enjoy this movie. The ""political incorrectness"" did not bother me, but I could see some people getting offended by it. This movie is pretty well made for having a budget of only $[...]. Nothing new is brought to the zombie lore, but it's a silly, enjoyable, fun movie to get and watch with a bunch of friends.RATING: 3.75 out of 5",4,A review from Zombie-Nation!,1193788800,"10 31, 2007",2007,3569,"['SPECIAL', 'NOTE', 'First', 'foremost', 'movie', 'VERY', 'politcally', 'INcorrect', 'so', 'much', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'offended', 'up', 'stereotypes', 'individuals', 'are', 'challenged', 'fairness', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'stock', 'stereotypes', 'have', 'seen', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'not', 'you.1', 'ACTING', 'Amazingly', 'enough', 'acting', 'movie', 'very', 'strong', 'anything', 'would', 'say', 'dialogue', 'actors', 'had', 'say', 'caused', 'more', 'grief', 'actors', 'performances', 'special', 'people', 'film', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'actors', 'portraying', 'kept', 'performances', 'restrained', 'so', 'not', 'go', 'top', 'stable', 'stereotypes', 'were', 'here', 'full', 'force', 'i.e', 'tough', 'dude', 'hot', 'goth', 'chick', 'grizzled', 'old', 'veteran', 'street', 'hood', 'so', 'on.2', 'ZOMBIES', 'zombies', 'one', 'are', 'Snyder', 'Runners', 'also', 'are', 'capable', 'hiding', 'stalking', 'using', 'weapons', 'lying', 'wait', 'victims', 'movie', 'found', 'difficult', 'decipher', 'what', 'exactly', 'would', 'kill', 'zombie', 'seemed', 'die', 'stabbings', 'were', 'killed', 'ol', 'standby', 'shot', 'brain', 'zombies', 'one', 'seem', 'rot', 'really', 'fast', 'turning', 'Nothing', 'new', 'really', 'brought', 'zombies', 'concerning', 'how', 'act', 'respond', 'kill', 'anything.3', 'PRODUCTION', 'majority', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'night', 'people', 'knew', 'how', 'light', 'scene', 'make', 'sure', 'viewer', 'could', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'movies', 'film', 'night', 'provide', 'light', 'source', 'viewer', 'really', 'clue', 'what', 'happening', 'only', 'complaint', 'had', 'was', 'noticed', 'few', 'times', 'night', 'scenes', 'was', 'film', 'would', 'take', 'grainy', 'type', 'texture', 'watching', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'was', 'filmed', 'camcorder', 'was', 'almost', 'parody', 'zombie', 'films', 'will', 'let', 'producers', 'hook', 'heavy', 'metal', 'soundtrack', 'always', 'played', 'zombie', 'attack.4', 'SPECIAL', 'EFFECTS', 'Blood', 'gore', 'galore', 'Very', 'much', 'top', 'someone', 'received', 'paper', 'cut', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'covered', '3', 'gallons', 'blood', 'usual', 'bag', 'innards', 'local', 'butcher', 'shop', 'were', 'used', 'body', 'parts', 'instead', '1', 'bag', 'used', '25', 'bags', 'zombie', 'make', 'up', 'consisted', 'various', 'stages', 'rot', 'times', 'seemed', 'layers', 'mud', 'had', 'been', 'applied', 'actors', 'faces.5', 'NUDITY', 'Very', 'minimal', 'considering', 'sex', 'was', 'going', 'counselours', 'actress', 'portraying', 'Cassie', 'have', 'nice', 'pair', '[', ']', 'lets', 'have', 'good', 'long', 'look', '6', 'THE', 'CAUSE', 'Apparently', 'infected', 'well', 'nearby', 'instant', 'zombification', 'when', 'drink', 'Part', 'backstory', 'revealed', 'beginning', 'guy', 'Special', 'Dude', 'Ranch', 'got', 'land', 'real', 'cheap', 'PREVIOUS', 'zombie', 'attack', 'Zombies', 'are', 'accepted', 'part', 'life', 'movie', 'disbelief', 'zombie', 'attack', 'happening', 'real', 'reason', 'given', 'why', 'water', 'abandoned', 'well', 'one', 'turn', 'zombie', 'other', 'brief', 'little', 'backstory', 'previous', 'zombie', 'attack.Overall', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'could', 'see', 'people', 'getting', 'offended', 'movie', 'pretty', 'well', 'made', 'having', 'budget', 'only', '[', ']', 'Nothing', 'new', 'brought', 'zombie', 'lore', 'silly', 'enjoyable', 'fun', 'movie', 'get', 'watch', 'bunch', 'friends.RATING', '3.75', '5']",Special Dead
