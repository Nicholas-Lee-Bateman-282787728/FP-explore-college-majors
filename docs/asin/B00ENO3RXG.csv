Brady is a spiritual soul who seems to have it together, until his life is suddenly turned upside down by his half-brothers. Soon after the start of film, through no fault of his own, he is on an unexpected journey to find himself in a totally new environment. Just when things are looking up and it seems like his life is headed in a positive directions he hits another brick wall. It leaves you wondering if this young man will ever find any peace in his life.Except for Brady's half-brothers, this film comes with a fun and engaging cast of characters. Our family really enjoyed it this move and we were pleasantly surprised, It is a great film and absolutely not what we were expecting. This story is about family and forgiveness , and in the end never forgetting what's important in life.

1667952,ABC8FXLD7W528,B00ENO3RXG,"Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker","[2, 2]","Seasons of Gray is a modern re-telling of the story of Joseph in the Bible. We are introduced to Brady, who deals with his older brothers&#8217; vicious jealousy on a constant basis. The fact that he is their father&#8217;s favorite son only fuels the fire, as does Brady&#8217;s gift of being able to interpret dreams. When Brady receives a new truck for his birthday, his brothers decide they&#8217;ve had enough and take matters into their own hands.Their ruthless decision forever changes the course of Brady&#8217;s life.But does God still have a plan for Brady&#8217;s life despite the horror of what is to come?Later sentenced to prison based on the words of his boss&#8217;s wife, who dishonestly accuses him of assault, Brady is faced with a decision. Does he turn his back on God, or grow in his faith?That&#8217;s not the only major decision of which Brady faces. He&#8217;s also faced with yet another dilemma regarding his brothers.Seasons of Gray has many great discussion points, including:God&#8217;s plan for our lives, even when things go awry (Jeremiah 29:11);Forgiveness (Matthew 6:14-15; Matthew 18:22);Being a new creation in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17); and,What was intended for bad, God can use to accomplish His purposes (Genesis 50:20).While Seasons of Gray is a family film with nothing objectionable, it does contain thematic elements appropriate only for those 13 and older. There is some violence, but it is tastefully done and not of the typical &#8220;Hollywood&#8221; variety. Regarding the scene with Brady&#8217;s boss&#8217;s wife, the issue of sexual assault is also discussed, although not explicitly shown.Everything about Seasons of Gray is well done. The acting is top-notch, the plot engaging, the story line realistic, and the scenes vivid.Some movies are &#8220;downloads&#8221; or &#8220;rentals.&#8221; And some movies are &#8220;to purchase.&#8221; Seasons of Gray falls into the latter category.

His brothers, driven by jealousy, cast away their own flesh and blood in the same way Joseph was sold into slavery by his siblings.Heartbroken and separated from his family, Brady holds tightly to his faith and begins to build a new life for himself. But there are more challenges in store for this servant of God.False accusations land Brady in prison, where his God-given gift of interpreting dreams helps him forge friendships that will play an important role in his ultimate salvation. Upon his miraculous release from prison, Brady discovers, as his dreams predicted, that his brothers direly need his help.
