To its credit, it is better than the Replacement Killers; as uncondonable as Mark Wahlberg is, he is much easier to take  than Mira Sorvino. Additionally, the story in this one is a touch more  interesting, though the buddy-cop aesthetic, action sequences, and just  about everything else, were all done ten times better in Chow's Hong Kong  films.

I won't spoil the quote you have to take it in context of the scenario of the movie. What an impact it made in my life that what I do in my life will be what I live with.  I don't know if I over looked the goings on with Nick Chen because after all he was Yun-Fat Chow or that his over looking Uncle Benny's activities was some how a kindness to help May a lost drug addict and prostitute unable to escape her fate he tries to be more then a cop in her heart.  The entire movie was tastefully done, story line excellant, directed in a way to make you laugh, cry, sit at the edge of you chair during those action scenes.  Not to mention the sound track subpurbly done.  I have had always found Yun-Fat Chow a believable actor in all rolls he portray; this movie he stole my heart (more then in Anna and the King).. the ending must be seen to appreciate how to me he was a good cop, with admiration to the writer in whatever message he wanted to leave you at the end.  If you thought Mark Wahlberg was exceptional in this roll you should see him in The Perfect Storm and never thought he would play such a sicko in Fear but had me convinced. Lady's don't judge all men by what goes on in this movie but be wise to it's message of common sense.  It always amazes me when an actor can play his/her complete opposite.  I look forward to watching more of both of these great actors movies.  Don't wait to buy THE CORRUPTOR should it go out of print you will regret it! Well I think so.  Thanks for listening - Bye.

466253,AHAJB6Y4WATM4,630547642X,Andrew C.,"[27, 29]","This film seems to better represent the Chinese, Chow Yun Fat especially, in American film.  Recent efforts by HK film stars have resulted in the terrible stereotyping that always takes place in Hollywood.  Rushhour and  Lethal Weapon 4 both made objects of their Chinese stars, Chan and Li,  respectively.  The Corruptor shows the respect neccesary of an actor like  Chow Yun Fat, one of the finest and most prolific actors that has ever  lived.  It deals with the Chinese in a more mature way, almost as if  previous knowledge is helpful in fully understanding the movie.  The only  problem with this movie is that Fat is better than it.  No one can expect  Foley to provide the action neccesary to impress an American audience that  knows Fat, but in American action standards he does fine.  The opening to  the film is a very intense shoot-out in a Chinese lamp shop and later in  the film a Chinese song is actually played as the prominent background  music.

No one figured out where the film was going  or what it was about.  They just filmed it. Sime nice colors, some fair  (for HK movies) action sequences, nice camera angles.  And talk like you're  overhearing a bunch of random telephone conversations.  A dish of Chinese  noodles is far more coherent than the strands of this movie.  And yet, we  should encourage these Hong Kong types to make more movies in the US.  They  do bring a nice perspective.  So far, it seems that the lavish Hollywood  budgets have corrupted these movies.  The high budget certainly seems to  have corrupted THE CORRUPTOR.  We have to get back to basics, i.e., a good  screenplay.  Once you have that, bring in the Hong Kong stars and  directors.  Bring in Chingmy Yau, while you're at it.

466255,A1TPXS3X3QJIEO,630547642X,"Arthur Gardner ""Aardcore""","[1, 1]","I initially got this movie because I remember watching it some years ago when I lived in Germany and there was a time when my father and I decided to make up the time to swing by faster by renting movies almost every day or every week at least and watching them through; movies I'd never even really heard or seen. Usually they were kung fu movies and such, but every now and then we'd pick up a movie that would seem to pass the entertainment radars for us (when you're an American in Germany, it's REALLY hard to find American movies or their debuts to hit overseas as it takes at least 6 months, if you're lucky, to almost 2 years just for an American movie to come out... can you imagine? While you read on the news that somewhere in California the Matrix has started, you'd have to wait an extra few months just to watch, or something like that-- I just use the Matrix as an example.)The Corruptor was one of those movies and sadly, we'd ended up watching the movie on DVD because it just never showed up in the bigscreens there. So anyway, I remember watching this movie and thought about how insanely deep this movie was. All the stuff about Chinese gangs, crime, the asian-flare of a metropolis society and how everyone seems not to care-- plus it has Mark Wahlberg who's one of my most favorite hollywood actors. More importantly, it also houses CHOW YUN FAT!!! Not only does it have a favorite actor of mine but has an amazing chinese kung fu actor! Performances from both these actors really stock you in for the vicious ride and twists this movie has for a plot and the action that befits it isn't over the top since the setting is basically China Town.In a way I wanna say this is like Law & Order meets Shaft, but that's a disheartening comparison except to say that it has the crime story scene with the heart-pounding action of the latter but intensified ten fold. The cinematography is astounding, the characters, protagonist and antagonists, all are a great bunch to watch intermingle with and against one another and it's a really good movie worth the watch; the least to say, own.Really, if you dig cop movies, this is your hit.If you dig drama, this movie's your bag.If you dig action, this movie's your well-given shot.Seriously top notch stuff and glad I came across it years ago.

The Corruptor is a prime example of this saying because everyone in Chinatown is hiding something in this movie. Detective Nick Chen, played by international star Chow Yun-Fat, heads the Asian Crime Unit in his precinct. Chen is a decorated hero with many years on the force. He is also in the back pocket of Uncle Benny, the leader of the old-line gang in the city. Because of this he is fighting even harder to take down the Fukienese Dragons, a gang of young Chinese recently arrived to America. Adding to his problems Chen has a new cop in his unit, Mark Wahlberg plays Danny Wallace. Wallace is a rookie with his own secrets including a father who owes the Italian mob a large sum of money.The Corruptor is fun! Any movie that starts off with an entire storefront exploding and the one ""survivor"" being gunned down as he comes out the door is bound to grab your attention. Many gunfights and chase scenes later you even realize there is a story here. Mark Wahlberg continues to improve as an actor though it is hard to think of him as anything other than ""Marky Mark."" Chow Yun-Fat is the main reason to see this movie. He was a star in China for many years before we were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of him. His English has improved immensely from his first American movie, The Replacement Killers, and his charisma is at the level that it always has been.

466264,A152C8GYY25HAH,630547642X,Matthew Horner,"[2, 3]","In The Corruptor, rookie New York cop Danny Wallace gets assigned to the Chinatown section. It soon looks like he is in way over his head. He's the only Caucasian in a formerly all Chinese unit, and his fellow cops don't want him around. This includes his partner, Nick Chen. There is enough crime and violence in a single day in Chinatown to fill an entire season of the TV series Law and Order. Wallace doesn't have long to prove his worth in this sea of criminals and gang lords movie, but reality is utterly disregarded. Midway though The Corruptor, something dawned on me. The action isn't supposed to reflect reality. What has happened over the last two decades is that one of the greatest and purely American genres, the Western, went out of fashion. You couldn't pay the public to see one. Yet the power of the Western as an idea remained, and it reappeared in the form of these modern cops and robbers movies. So, when the bad guys are chased in their vehicles by the good guys, it's no different from when the outlaw gang rode into town. Shots would be fired, and it was up to the citizens to take cover. There were no rights to be read, no one to keep the law officers in line. People dropped like flies in those old Westerns. The differences were that fake blood didn't fly from their bodies, and the sound of the gunfire didn't explode in Dolby digital sound. From now on, I will tell myself that I am watching a 21st Century Western.Mark Wahlberg and Yun-Fat Chow really do try their best to be professional throughout the movie, although they throw each other some knowing glances that probably have nothing to do with the script.",3,Two great performances in midless crime drama,1016755200,"03 22, 2002",2002,1645,"['Corruptor', 'New', 'York', 'cop', 'Danny', 'Wallace', 'assigned', 'Chinatown', 'section', 'soon', 'way', 'head', 'only', 'Caucasian', 'formerly', 'Chinese', 'unit', 'fellow', 'cops', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'around', 'partner', 'Nick', 'Chen', 'enough', 'crime', 'violence', 'single', 'day', 'Chinatown', 'fill', 'entire', 'season', 'TV', 'series', 'Law', 'Order', 'Wallace', ""n't"", 'have', 'long', 'prove', 'worth', 'sea', 'criminals', 'gang', 'lords', 'movie', 'reality', 'utterly', 'disregarded', 'Midway', 'Corruptor', 'something', 'dawned', 'action', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'reflect', 'reality', 'What', 'happened', 'last', 'two', 'decades', 'one', 'greatest', 'purely', 'American', 'genres', 'Western', 'went', 'fashion', 'could', ""n't"", 'pay', 'public', 'see', 'one', 'power', 'Western', 'idea', 'remained', 'reappeared', 'form', 'modern', 'cops', 'robbers', 'movies', 'So', 'when', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'chased', 'vehicles', 'good', 'guys', 'different', 'when', 'outlaw', 'gang', 'rode', 'town', 'Shots', 'would', 'be', 'fired', 'was', 'up', 'citizens', 'take', 'cover', 'were', 'rights', 'be', 'read', 'one', 'keep', 'law', 'officers', 'line', 'People', 'dropped', 'flies', 'old', 'Westerns', 'differences', 'were', 'fake', 'blood', 'did', ""n't"", 'fly', 'bodies', 'sound', 'gunfire', 'did', ""n't"", 'explode', 'Dolby', 'digital', 'sound', 'now', 'will', 'tell', 'am', 'watching', '21st', 'Century', 'Western.Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Yun-Fat', 'Chow', 'really', 'do', 'try', 'best', 'be', 'professional', 'movie', 'throw', 'other', 'knowing', 'glances', 'probably', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'script']",Corruptor VHS

I figured a straight-forward shoot-'em-up and some exotic intrigue was about all it would have going for it. The cover had the usual fatuous nonsense on it: &quot;You can't play by the rules when there aren't any.&quot; Why is it 90% of video covers have a reformulation of the same stupid subtitle? Apparently there is some lucky guy out there is employed writing new, yet indistinguishable ways to either deny the existence of Rules/Boundaries/etc. or at least deny their applicability to some beautiful, well-armed people. Good for him.Anyway, this movie definitely exceeded my expectations. Great direction, but most of all great performances from Chow-Yun Fat and Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg's relationship with his father was fairly cliched, yet it still came across as believable. The various moral predicaments of the two cops were just as interesting and well-done as the fight scenes. There is one major chase scene, which I found silly after a while, since it gave the impression that there were absolutely no other police cars within ten miles of some maniac with an Uzi blowing away civilians.But that is a nothing criticism. Really, the only sore spot was the FBI goonish guy, who was both tiresome and one-dimensional in comparison with the other characters. But on the main, an excellent action-thriller.

466269,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,630547642X,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 3]","Sorry to say, ""The Corruptor"" is a ho hum, strictly by-the-numbers police procedural set in a precinct in the heart of New York City's Chinatown.  Chow-Yun Fat stars as the officer in charge of the district, a generally  serious and dedicated cop whose corruptibility we see played out as he beds  local prostitutes and makes cozy sweetheart deals with a racketeer in the  neighborhood.  Then in walks Wallace as a neophyte cop, the first white man  ever to work in this all-Asian department.  The question then becomes:  is  this new officer (Mark Wahlberg) as corrupt as Nick or is there a secret  hidden behind his faade of ""green"" newcomer?Actually, the story of the  film emerges as more interesting in cold print than it does in its final  cinematic form. As written by Robert Pucci and directed by James Foley, the  film, particularly in its early stages, verges practically on the  incomprehensible.  This is partly due to the fact that the thick accents of  virtually the entire cast render much of the dialogue indecipherable (and  Wahlberg is not a heck of a lot better on that score in all honesty).  One  almost wishes that the entire film (rather than just a few brief snippets)  could have been translated with subtitles.  Adding to the incoherence is  the astonishing profusion of characters hurled our way almost from the very  beginning.  We spend much of the film just trying to figure out who is who,  how each person is related to the others, exactly how many gangs are  involved in the proceedings and what exactly it is they are all  after.Luckily, about halfway into the film, the elements begin to jell a  bit and the interest level increases ever so slightly as the two principal  characters begin to discover truths about each other initially held back  from both them and us.  Even here, though, the film actually treads over  ground that was explored to far greater effectiveness in ""Donnie Brasco"" a  few years back.  That earlier movie, however, was considerably more  intrigued by the moral complexities of its situations and characters than  ""The Corruptor,"" with its weak and uninspired screenplay, ever manages to  be.  For the most part, this film is executed like a standard issue  cops-and-robbers shoot-em-up, filled with mediocre car chases and poorly  staged gun battles.  The filmmakers simply don't have the intellectual  where-with-all to cope with the ethical issues they want so desperately to  explore.It's highly unlikely that even the most die-hard action movie  fan will be particularly impressed with this tepid genre entry.  The  saddest aspect of the film is watching the talented Mark Wahlberg (who has  scored most effectively in the past when appearing in more serious,  non-blockbuster roles and films) as he continues his unsuccessful attempt  to secure a place as a sure-fired draw at the movie box office.  The best  advice to Wahlberg may be to simply stop trying to be a star and  concentrate on being an actor.",2,weak action film,964656000,"07 27, 2000",2000,2973,"['Sorry', 'say', 'Corruptor', 'ho', 'hum', 'strictly', 'by-the-numbers', 'police', 'procedural', 'set', 'precinct', 'heart', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Chinatown', 'Chow-Yun', 'Fat', 'stars', 'officer', 'charge', 'district', 'generally', 'serious', 'dedicated', 'cop', 'corruptibility', 'see', 'played', 'out', 'local', 'prostitutes', 'cozy', 'sweetheart', 'deals', 'racketeer', 'neighborhood', 'Then', 'walks', 'Wallace', 'neophyte', 'cop', 'first', 'white', 'man', 'ever', 'work', 'all-Asian', 'department', 'question', 'then', 'new', 'officer', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'as', 'corrupt', 'Nick', 'secret', 'hidden', 'faade', 'green', 'newcomer', 'Actually', 'story', 'film', 'more', 'interesting', 'cold', 'print', 'final', 'cinematic', 'form', 'written', 'Robert', 'Pucci', 'directed', 'James', 'Foley', 'film', 'particularly', 'early', 'stages', 'verges', 'practically', 'incomprehensible', 'partly', 'due', 'fact', 'thick', 'accents', 'virtually', 'entire', 'cast', 'render', 'much', 'dialogue', 'indecipherable', 'Wahlberg', 'not', 'heck', 'lot', 'better', 'score', 'honesty', 'One', 'almost', 'entire', 'film', 'rather', 'just', 'few', 'brief', 'snippets', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'translated', 'subtitles', 'Adding', 'incoherence', 'astonishing', 'profusion', 'characters', 'hurled', 'way', 'almost', 'very', 'beginning', 'spend', 'much', 'film', 'just', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'who', 'how', 'person', 'related', 'others', 'exactly', 'how', 'many', 'gangs', 'are', 'involved', 'proceedings', 'what', 'exactly', 'are', 'after.Luckily', 'halfway', 'film', 'elements', 'begin', 'jell', 'bit', 'interest', 'level', 'increases', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'two', 'principal', 'characters', 'begin', 'discover', 'truths', 'other', 'initially', 'held', 'back', 'Even', 'here', 'though', 'film', 'actually', 'over', 'ground', 'was', 'explored', 'far', 'greater', 'effectiveness', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'earlier', 'movie', 'however', 'was', 'considerably', 'more', 'intrigued', 'moral', 'complexities', 'situations', 'characters', 'Corruptor', 'weak', 'uninspired', 'screenplay', 'ever', 'be', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'executed', 'standard', 'issue', 'cops-and-robbers', 'shoot-em-up', 'filled', 'mediocre', 'car', 'chases', 'poorly', 'staged', 'gun', 'battles', 'filmmakers', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'intellectual', 'where-with-all', 'cope', 'ethical', 'issues', 'want', 'so', 'desperately', 'explore.It', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'even', 'most', 'die-hard', 'action', 'movie', 'fan', 'will', 'be', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'tepid', 'genre', 'entry', 'saddest', 'aspect', 'film', 'watching', 'talented', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'scored', 'most', 'effectively', 'past', 'when', 'appearing', 'more', 'serious', 'non-blockbuster', 'roles', 'films', 'unsuccessful', 'attempt', 'secure', 'place', 'sure-fired', 'draw', 'movie', 'box', 'office', 'best', 'advice', 'Wahlberg', 'may', 'be', 'simply', 'stop', 'trying', 'be', 'star', 'concentrate', 'being', 'actor']",Corruptor VHS
