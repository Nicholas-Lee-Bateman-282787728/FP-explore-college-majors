672027,A1P6MKKYNSMCML,B00005O6ON,Fast Forward,"[3, 3]","If you've ever tried making your own animation using dolls or what-have-you, you may have found it an impossible trick to do at all, let alone well.  Imagine then, a feature-length film produced this way, one painstaking frame at a time, while keeping all the little nuances of character and charm. A Herculean task indeed.  But the producers of this film did exactly that.  There are moments when these doll-actors seem to live and breathe.The characters are beautifully and beguilingly designed. Gretel and her mother look VERY much like ""Lost in Space"" actress June Lockhart, and the witch looks like an amalgamation of Carmen Miranda, Tallulah Bankhead, and Lucille Ball.  Anna Russell provides the campy, kooky witch voice, sung with operatic bravado.Nice touches: at times the witch acts totally out of her mind, and surprisingly it makes her more convincing; Hansel is protective of his little sister, calming her when she's terrified and brushing dirt off her skirt. The father has a good singing voice and his optimism plays well against the mother's listlessness. For all her strictness, we can relate to her feelings of helplessness.The visual backdrop to this story is a forest full of shadows and light, delightful and yet forboding. The entire film floats on the magnificent musical score by Humperdinck, and the lyrics to the music are very well translated.Nowadays, films like ""Gone with the Wind"" get royal DVD treatment: they seek out and clean up the original camera negatives, correct any color problems and re-record the soundtrack digitally, cleaning up the noise.  I wonder if anyone knows where the camera negatives are for THIS film?  Think of the gorgeous DVD that they could make with this enchanting classic.  I saw this film about 4 times in a theater in 1966, and I remember it looking stunning.  This film deserves to ALWAYS look that great!",4,Some digital video magic is needed,1078876800,"03 10, 2004",2004,1872,"[""'ve"", 'ever', 'tried', 'making', 'own', 'animation', 'using', 'dolls', 'what-have-you', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'impossible', 'trick', 'do', 'let', 'alone', 'well', 'Imagine', 'then', 'feature-length', 'film', 'produced', 'way', 'one', 'painstaking', 'frame', 'time', 'keeping', 'little', 'nuances', 'character', 'charm', 'Herculean', 'task', 'indeed', 'producers', 'film', 'did', 'exactly', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'doll-actors', 'seem', 'live', 'breathe.The', 'characters', 'are', 'beautifully', 'beguilingly', 'designed', 'Gretel', 'mother', 'look', 'VERY', 'much', 'Lost', 'Space', 'actress', 'June', 'Lockhart', 'witch', 'amalgamation', 'Carmen', 'Miranda', 'Tallulah', 'Bankhead', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Anna', 'Russell', 'campy', 'kooky', 'witch', 'voice', 'sung', 'operatic', 'bravado.Nice', 'touches', 'times', 'witch', 'totally', 'mind', 'surprisingly', 'more', 'convincing', 'Hansel', 'protective', 'little', 'sister', 'calming', 'when', 'terrified', 'brushing', 'dirt', 'skirt', 'father', 'good', 'singing', 'voice', 'optimism', 'well', 'mother', 'listlessness', 'strictness', 'can', 'relate', 'feelings', 'helplessness.The', 'visual', 'backdrop', 'story', 'forest', 'full', 'shadows', 'light', 'delightful', 'yet', 'forboding', 'entire', 'film', 'floats', 'magnificent', 'musical', 'score', 'Humperdinck', 'lyrics', 'music', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'translated.Nowadays', 'films', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'get', 'royal', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'seek', 'out', 'clean', 'up', 'original', 'camera', 'negatives', 'correct', 'color', 'problems', 're-record', 'soundtrack', 'digitally', 'cleaning', 'up', 'noise', 'wonder', 'anyone', 'where', 'camera', 'negatives', 'are', 'THIS', 'film', 'Think', 'gorgeous', 'DVD', 'could', 'make', 'enchanting', 'classic', 'saw', 'film', '4', 'times', 'theater', '1966', 'remember', 'looking', 'stunning', 'film', 'ALWAYS', 'look', 'great']",N/A

The artists made little figures, with such amazing detail that it allows for facial expressions and movement, and then took more than 140,000 pictures of them to give them movement and life.  It makes for a very unusual presentation--neither cartoon nor real people.It appeals to mainly two groups:  those looking for an introduction to the opera or story of Hansel and Gretel, and those interested in a movie like Disney's ""Fantasia.""Oh, I should have said THREE groups:  there is also a growing interest in this as a camp movie (like the Rocky Horror Picture Show).

I'm not an opera fan by any means, but this production is so delightfully funny, and engagingly done that it makes even the music irresistible. Anna Russell as the witch is great, with her cackling and laughing until she snorts!I must agree with several other reviewers that the quality of this particular company's dvd is not the best, but it appears to be the only version available. It isn't terrible, as some reviewers claim, however. Unfortunately, it appears to come down to a miss it or accept it situation. I had a VHS copy for years, so I went to Netflix and ordered a copy of this dvd just to see how bad the quality was before buying it.

I used to watch this over and over again when I was younger. My mother had bought a VHS copy of this at Wal Mart. Watched it all the time, and then it accidentally got sold at a yard sale. Don't know how that happened, but it did. Anyways, ever since then, I had always looked for a copy, but could never find one until now.This is one of the best children's films ever produced, and the best claymation production ever...well, this and The Nightmare Before Christmas. It may look dated, but we have to remember that it WAS made in the '50s. Anna Russell still cracks me up as the voice of Rosina Rubylips, the witch. The entire vocal cast is excellent! I LOVE THIS FILM!The only problem with the DVD is this: It looks as though someone took a VHS and transferred it over to a DVD. The sound isn't that great at times, either. Since this is the only version available at the moment, it will have to do. When (and if) they do finally remaster it and clean it up, I'll buy a new version of it. As of now, I'll settle with this one.There is also a ten minute ""making of"" feature on here. Pretty interesting. If you grew up with this, and you love it like I do, buy it.

672034,A7OBFVHNJGI2A,B00005O6ON,Timothy Hulsey,"[3, 5]","The View Video edition of HANSEL AND GRETEL (alas, the only one available as of 2008) features a video transfer that looks suspiciously like a copy from a VHS master.  The overmodulated, fuzzy audio is no better.  In short, this DVD is very nearly unwatchable.  Only a few extras here, including a brief ""making-of"" short for 1950s television.As for the film itself, it's an odd little curio but no masterpiece, certainly not as good as the Engelbert Humperdinck opera it's (loosely) based on.  The animation is generally lifeless and inexpressive, and the various attempts at cuteness come off as creepy.  But Anna Russell's spry turn as the Witch injects some much-needed vigor into the proceedings, and Irish poet Padraic Colum's translation of the German libretto is excellent -- when you can understand it.RKO Pictures commissioned HANSEL AND GRETEL in 1954 as a low-budget alternative to Disney features -- a necessary move, since at the time the Disney studio was making plans to distribute its product through an in-house company.  The film was animated in sequence and rushed through production, which explains why earlier scenes are smoother than later ones.  It doesn't approach Disney caliber, on a technical or a narrative level.  Even though the film garnered some respectful reviews on its initial release, and seems to have performed adequately at the box office, RKO didn't care to repeat the experiment.",2,Bad transfer,1212278400,"06 1, 2008",2008,1421,"['View', 'Video', 'edition', 'HANSEL', 'AND', 'GRETEL', 'alas', 'only', 'one', 'available', '2008', 'video', 'transfer', 'suspiciously', 'copy', 'VHS', 'master', 'overmodulated', 'fuzzy', 'audio', 'better', 'short', 'DVD', 'very', 'nearly', 'unwatchable', 'Only', 'few', 'extras', 'here', 'including', 'brief', 'making-of', 'short', '1950s', 'television.As', 'film', 'odd', 'little', 'curio', 'masterpiece', 'certainly', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Engelbert', 'Humperdinck', 'opera', 'loosely', 'based', 'animation', 'generally', 'lifeless', 'inexpressive', 'various', 'attempts', 'cuteness', 'come', 'off', 'creepy', 'Anna', 'Russell', 'spry', 'turn', 'Witch', 'much-needed', 'vigor', 'proceedings', 'Irish', 'poet', 'Padraic', 'Colum', 'translation', 'German', 'libretto', 'excellent', 'when', 'can', 'understand', 'it.RKO', 'Pictures', 'commissioned', 'HANSEL', 'AND', 'GRETEL', '1954', 'low-budget', 'alternative', 'Disney', 'features', 'necessary', 'move', 'time', 'Disney', 'studio', 'was', 'making', 'plans', 'distribute', 'product', 'in-house', 'company', 'film', 'was', 'animated', 'sequence', 'rushed', 'production', 'why', 'earlier', 'scenes', 'are', 'smoother', 'later', 'ones', ""n't"", 'approach', 'Disney', 'caliber', 'technical', 'narrative', 'level', 'Even', 'film', 'garnered', 'respectful', 'reviews', 'initial', 'release', 'have', 'performed', 'adequately', 'box', 'office', 'RKO', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'repeat', 'experiment']",N/A
