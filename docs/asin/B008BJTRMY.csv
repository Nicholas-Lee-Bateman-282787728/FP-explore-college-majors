Don't get me wrong, for a movie of this type, it's ok...but it doesn't try too hard to rise above the pack. Especially with Ken Foree(star of the 1977 Dawn of the Dead movie) being in it, who's such a big part of zombie movie history,you'd think they'd want to.It tells the story of Interpol agents, who are transporting a dangerous prisoner,  stumble upon the site of an ecological disaster that has turned the local residents into zombies. The agents' only chance of survival is to join forces with their prisoners and fight their way through the zombies.Ken Foree, Kristina Klebe, Emilio Roso, Vukota Brajovi, Miodrag Miki Krstovi, and Danilo Bekovi all put in modest acting performances. If I had to pick one thing that I liked most about the film, it would be how the cinematography was done. At times, it was laid back. While other times, frantic.Giving the description for the movie, I just realized that it sounds an awful lot like another zombie movie I seen here recently. At any rate, like that movie, Apocalypse of the Dead is okay. A decent timekiller. Good for a rental, perhaps to purchase if the price is very affordable(a ten spot or less). Otherwise, I'd give it some thought if I were you.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: I read, at Wikipedia, that a sequel has been planned since that movie was made. Hopefully, Directors Milan Konjevi and Milan Todorovi will take the opportunity to make this next one count.blackaciddevil",3,Apocalypse of the Dead......,1346198400,"08 29, 2012",2012,1670,"['Apocalypse', 'Dead', 'apparent', 'beginning', 'low-budget', 'zombie', 'movie', 'comfortable', 'just', 'being', 'typical', ""'everyday"", 'garden', 'variety', 'zombie', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'movie', 'type', 'ok', ""n't"", 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'rise', 'pack', 'Especially', 'Ken', 'Foree', 'star', '1977', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'movie', 'being', 'who', 'big', 'part', 'zombie', 'movie', 'history', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'want', 'to.It', 'story', 'Interpol', 'agents', 'who', 'are', 'transporting', 'dangerous', 'prisoner', 'stumble', 'site', 'ecological', 'disaster', 'turned', 'local', 'residents', 'zombies', 'agents', 'only', 'chance', 'survival', 'join', 'forces', 'prisoners', 'fight', 'way', 'zombies.Ken', 'Foree', 'Kristina', 'Klebe', 'Emilio', 'Roso', 'Vukota', 'Brajovi', 'Miodrag', 'Miki', 'Krstovi', 'Danilo', 'Bekovi', 'put', 'modest', 'acting', 'performances', 'had', 'pick', 'one', 'thing', 'liked', 'most', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'how', 'cinematography', 'was', 'done', 'times', 'was', 'laid', 'back', 'other', 'times', 'frantic.Giving', 'description', 'movie', 'just', 'realized', 'awful', 'lot', 'zombie', 'movie', 'seen', 'here', 'recently', 'rate', 'movie', 'Apocalypse', 'Dead', 'okay', 'decent', 'timekiller', 'Good', 'rental', 'perhaps', 'purchase', 'price', 'very', 'affordable', 'ten', 'spot', 'less', 'Otherwise', ""'d"", 'give', 'thought', 'were', 'you.', '-Update', 'read', 'Wikipedia', 'sequel', 'been', 'planned', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Hopefully', 'Directors', 'Milan', 'Konjevi', 'Milan', 'Todorovi', 'will', 'take', 'opportunity', 'make', 'next', 'one', 'count.blackaciddevil']",N/A

Not one of the greatest Zombie Flicks but better than a lot of others ones that have been made before it & since. It was a low budget movie and some of the actors needed lessons while others were really good. Ken Foree from the original Dawn of the Dead honestly was just awful his in this movie I cannot see why he got so much praise. The one guy in the movie who was the best was the Mental Patient Lunatic called Armageddon he was a total Bad ass going around killing anything while quoting Biblical quotes!Again I enjoy a good zombie movie and this was enjoyable, so don't listen to all the bad reviews about it.",3,Zombies Zombies Zombies,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,690,"['OK', 'got', 'watch', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Not', 'one', 'greatest', 'Zombie', 'Flicks', 'better', 'lot', 'others', 'ones', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'actors', 'needed', 'lessons', 'others', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'Ken', 'Foree', 'original', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'honestly', 'was', 'just', 'awful', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'why', 'got', 'so', 'much', 'praise', 'one', 'guy', 'movie', 'who', 'was', 'best', 'was', 'Mental', 'Patient', 'Lunatic', 'called', 'Armageddon', 'was', 'total', 'Bad', 'ass', 'going', 'killing', 'anything', 'quoting', 'Biblical', 'quotes', 'Again', 'enjoy', 'good', 'zombie', 'movie', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'bad', 'reviews']",N/A

The acting was amateurish, bland and emotionless! 45 minutes into the film I fell asleep! I'm really surprised that Ken Foree took on this role. He was great in Dawn of the Dead! This totally sucked.I gave it two stars because I felt the zombies were good. This could have been an exciting film considering they had the best atmosphere to do it in, but I could never care for any of the characters or really get involved in the film.
