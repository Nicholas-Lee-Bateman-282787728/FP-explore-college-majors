442564,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,6304981848,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[9, 15]","Edward Burn's earlier work &quot;The Brothers McMullen&quot; is fantastic and earns a five star recommendation.  It dealt with family members that were doing something with  their lives.  Those individuals exhibited both the virtues and moral failings commonly found in all human beings.  The three main characters in &quot;No Looking Back,&quot;  though,  are trapped in their banal and frustrating circumstances because of laziness.  They have no one to blame but themselves for lacking ambition and settling for  mediocrity.Lauren Holly plays the part of Claudia, a woman who is attracted to men who prefer drinking in bars and wasting time.  Charlie (Burns) has returned to the blue collar  hometown allegedly to patch things up with Claudia.  He is an extremely selfish male who manipulates women for his own satisfaction.  Charlie's lack of morality  even went so far as to have urged Claudia into.... My skin crawled whenever Burns appeared on the screen.  I  concede that far more evil people have existed on this planet, but hopefully the Charlies of the world are the exception and not the norm.  The character of Michael  portrayed by Jon Bon Jovi is also a weak man too cowardly to accept the challenges of life.  Am I being overly critical towards the lower classes?  Not at all, for I grew  up in similar circumstances.  The difference is that those desiring to set goals and achieve them left these neighborhoods as soon possible upon reaching their late  teens.  It is one thing if somebody lacks the native abilities to existentially choose a more rewarding life.  However, this trio of losers merely wants to earn enough  money to purchase their next six pack of beer and cigarettes.  The end of the movie has Claudia bravely setting out to improve her future prospects.  One can only hope that she is  successful.The saving grace of this film is the dialogue provided by the very talented Burns.  I can only give &quot;No Looking Back&quot; three stars.  Most of us, if we are candid, have better things to do.",3,The People in &quot;No Looking Back&quot; are of Little Interest,996883200,"08 4, 2001",2001,2029,"['Edward', 'Burn', 'earlier', 'work', 'quot', 'Brothers', 'McMullen', 'quot', 'fantastic', 'five', 'star', 'recommendation', 'dealt', 'family', 'members', 'were', 'doing', 'something', 'lives', 'individuals', 'exhibited', 'virtues', 'moral', 'failings', 'commonly', 'found', 'human', 'beings', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'quot', 'Looking', 'Back', 'quot', 'are', 'trapped', 'banal', 'frustrating', 'circumstances', 'laziness', 'have', 'one', 'blame', 'lacking', 'ambition', 'settling', 'mediocrity.Lauren', 'Holly', 'part', 'Claudia', 'woman', 'who', 'attracted', 'men', 'who', 'prefer', 'drinking', 'bars', 'wasting', 'time', 'Charlie', 'Burns', 'returned', 'blue', 'collar', 'hometown', 'allegedly', 'patch', 'things', 'up', 'Claudia', 'extremely', 'selfish', 'male', 'who', 'women', 'own', 'satisfaction', 'Charlie', 'lack', 'morality', 'even', 'went', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'urged', 'Claudia', 'skin', 'crawled', 'whenever', 'Burns', 'appeared', 'screen', 'concede', 'far', 'more', 'evil', 'people', 'have', 'existed', 'planet', 'hopefully', 'Charlies', 'world', 'are', 'exception', 'not', 'norm', 'character', 'Michael', 'portrayed', 'Jon', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'also', 'weak', 'man', 'too', 'cowardly', 'accept', 'challenges', 'life', 'Am', 'being', 'overly', 'critical', 'towards', 'lower', 'classes', 'Not', 'grew', 'up', 'similar', 'circumstances', 'difference', 'desiring', 'set', 'goals', 'achieve', 'left', 'neighborhoods', 'soon', 'possible', 'reaching', 'late', 'teens', 'one', 'thing', 'somebody', 'native', 'abilities', 'existentially', 'choose', 'more', 'rewarding', 'life', 'However', 'trio', 'losers', 'merely', 'earn', 'enough', 'money', 'purchase', 'next', 'six', 'pack', 'beer', 'cigarettes', 'end', 'movie', 'Claudia', 'bravely', 'setting', 'out', 'improve', 'future', 'prospects', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'successful.The', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'dialogue', 'provided', 'very', 'talented', 'Burns', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'quot', 'No', 'Looking', 'Back', 'quot', 'three', 'stars', 'Most', 'are', 'candid', 'have', 'better', 'things', 'do']",No Looking Back VHS

Nice movie, a little too laid back for my taste, but good acting overcomes a mediocre script. Lauren Holly is gorgeous to look at,  and the rest of the cast (even Jon Bon Jovi) take this mood piece seriously  enough to turn in strong performances.The sountrack is simply amazing,  and I spent almost 1/2 hour trying to locate it on every internet site that  sells CD's, before I realized there was none. Whoever came up with the  brilliant decision not to release the sountrack should be taken out and  shot.

442567,A2Q7YBUV8IPTLW,6304981848,John K. Reed,"[5, 6]","What I liked most about this film is that it very accurately portrays the small mindedness that is too prevalent in much of our society today.  Of particular note are the local bar scenes and the dialogue that occurs  there.  Those scenes really underscore the fear of change and progression  that are keeping us from collectively becoming a more enlightened,  inclusive, and productive nation.Along the way we are privy to watch the  characters motivations, hopes, perceptions, virtues, and limitations  unfold.  And they are a pleasure to watch.  I thought all the actors were  outstanding and that they really brought small town reality to  life.Although I would not laud the beautiful Miss Holly as a great  actress, she has pretty consistently chosen to appear in particularly  relevant material and managed to give life to her characters.  Nonetheless  she delivers a very believable performance as a small town girl with big  dreams who has settled for a safe albeit unsatisfying existence.Burns,  as always is comic, charming, and immature.  On the surface that is.  But  in some of his orations he displays a wisdom and logic that is undeniable.  It's a compelling mix.  But most noteworthy however are that his skills as  a director have grown leaps and bounds with this picture (in my opinion).  And that's not to say that I disliked any of his previous films.  Quite the  contrary.His use of lighting.  His pacing.  The stills and the motion  shots.  Bravo.In short, it's got a little of everything.  Drama, comedy,  some great music and perhaps most importantly this film really makes you  feel for the characters and it makes you think about your own  life.Highly recommended.",5,Burns has really arrived (as a filmaker) with this one,956275200,"04 21, 2000",2000,1690,"['What', 'liked', 'most', 'film', 'very', 'accurately', 'small', 'mindedness', 'too', 'prevalent', 'much', 'society', 'today', 'particular', 'note', 'are', 'local', 'bar', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'there', 'scenes', 'really', 'fear', 'change', 'progression', 'are', 'keeping', 'collectively', 'becoming', 'more', 'enlightened', 'inclusive', 'productive', 'way', 'are', 'privy', 'watch', 'characters', 'motivations', 'hopes', 'perceptions', 'virtues', 'limitations', 'unfold', 'are', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'thought', 'actors', 'were', 'outstanding', 'really', 'brought', 'small', 'town', 'reality', 'would', 'not', 'laud', 'beautiful', 'Miss', 'Holly', 'great', 'actress', 'pretty', 'consistently', 'chosen', 'appear', 'particularly', 'relevant', 'material', 'managed', 'give', 'life', 'characters', 'Nonetheless', 'very', 'believable', 'performance', 'small', 'town', 'girl', 'big', 'dreams', 'who', 'settled', 'safe', 'albeit', 'unsatisfying', 'existence.Burns', 'always', 'comic', 'charming', 'immature', 'surface', 'orations', 'wisdom', 'logic', 'undeniable', 'compelling', 'mix', 'most', 'noteworthy', 'however', 'are', 'skills', 'director', 'have', 'grown', 'leaps', 'picture', 'opinion', 'not', 'say', 'disliked', 'previous', 'films', 'contrary.His', 'use', 'lighting', 'pacing', 'stills', 'motion', 'shots', 'Bravo.In', 'short', 'got', 'little', 'everything', 'Drama', 'comedy', 'great', 'music', 'perhaps', 'most', 'importantly', 'film', 'really', 'feel', 'characters', 'think', 'own', 'life.Highly', 'recommended']",No Looking Back VHS

442572,A39IY0JU5JI69G,6304981848,"Promise ""promise""","[0, 1]","This is a simple story, well told, about a young woman named Claudia, played by Lauren Holly, who has been living for three years with one of her high-school classmates, Michael, played by Jon Bon Jovi.  Michael works two shifts at some menial job to make ends meet and Claudia works as a waitress at a small diner.  They live in some depressed area on the Atlantic Coast somewhere. Into their lives comes Charlie, played by Burns, who also wrote and directed the film.  He's tall, cool and sexy and makes even the good looking Michael look shabby.  It turns out that Charlie and Claudia were once an item until he suddenly left her.  Now, three years later, he's ""thought things over"" and wants her back.For most of the film we see Claudia wavering back and forth between her undeniable attraction for Charlie and her loyalty to Michael and we wonder what she will choose.  There's a sub-plot involving her father who left her mother (played by the lovely Blythe Danner).There is a lot of music and if you have the captions on you'll see the words across the screen, which are supposedly echoing the action.  A lot of Bruce Springsteen.I didn't dislike the film. Burns is very charming and makes the screen light up when he's on it.  Bon Jovi comes across as a real sweetie but somehow born to loose.  The main dilemma is what Claudia will do and it takes an interesting actress to make us care.  I didn't think Lauren Holly did that.  She looks good, sort of how a waitress in a depressed town would look but her acting ability was mediocre.  Both her mother and sister showed more energy and generated more interest and sympathy from me. Michelle Williams would have nailed it.I kept having the feeling that this film would have been much more interesting when it came out than it was now.  We've seen too many films in the past decade that treat similar themes in a much better way.  I think the director overplayed the mood.  We get it, from the opening scenes, shot with a blue filter that this was going to be a ""heartfelt, melancholy"" piece.  And then there's all this Springsteen music.  I think the film might be good for dreamy teen aged girls but most thinking adults are going to want a little bit more.",3,Maybe a little dated,1381968000,"10 17, 2013",2013,2216,"['simple', 'story', 'well', 'told', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Claudia', 'played', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'who', 'been', 'living', 'three', 'years', 'one', 'high-school', 'classmates', 'Michael', 'played', 'Jon', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'Michael', 'two', 'shifts', 'menial', 'job', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'Claudia', 'waitress', 'small', 'diner', 'live', 'depressed', 'area', 'Atlantic', 'Coast', 'somewhere', 'Into', 'lives', 'Charlie', 'played', 'Burns', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'tall', 'cool', 'sexy', 'even', 'good', 'looking', 'Michael', 'look', 'shabby', 'out', 'Charlie', 'Claudia', 'were', 'once', 'item', 'suddenly', 'left', 'Now', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'thought', 'things', 'back.For', 'most', 'film', 'see', 'Claudia', 'wavering', 'back', 'forth', 'undeniable', 'attraction', 'Charlie', 'loyalty', 'Michael', 'wonder', 'what', 'will', 'choose', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'father', 'who', 'left', 'mother', 'played', 'lovely', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'lot', 'music', 'have', 'captions', ""'ll"", 'see', 'words', 'screen', 'are', 'supposedly', 'echoing', 'action', 'lot', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'dislike', 'film', 'Burns', 'very', 'charming', 'screen', 'light', 'up', 'when', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'across', 'real', 'sweetie', 'somehow', 'born', 'loose', 'main', 'dilemma', 'what', 'Claudia', 'will', 'do', 'interesting', 'actress', 'make', 'care', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'did', 'good', 'sort', 'how', 'waitress', 'depressed', 'town', 'would', 'look', 'acting', 'ability', 'was', 'mediocre', 'mother', 'sister', 'showed', 'more', 'energy', 'generated', 'more', 'interest', 'sympathy', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'would', 'have', 'nailed', 'it.I', 'kept', 'having', 'feeling', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'past', 'decade', 'treat', 'similar', 'themes', 'much', 'better', 'way', 'think', 'director', 'overplayed', 'mood', 'get', 'opening', 'scenes', 'shot', 'blue', 'filter', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'heartfelt', 'melancholy', 'piece', 'then', 'Springsteen', 'music', 'think', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'dreamy', 'teen', 'aged', 'girls', 'most', 'thinking', 'adults', 'are', 'going', 'want', 'little', 'bit', 'more']",No Looking Back VHS

Now she's waiting tables in a greasy spoon to help support her mother. After three years together, her live-in boyfriend, Michael (Jon Bon Jovi), is eager to tie the knot. Their life together is comfortable and Michael loves her. But Claudia has dreams of life beyond her home town and is afraid that if she marries now, she'll never realize them.Claudia's sister Kelly lives with her mother and struggles with good humor to care for her fatherless baby. Their mother hasn't left house since Claudia's dad walked out on the family six months ago. No one understands why Claudia sympathizes with her renegade father; like him, she has a wild, restless streak and longs for more. But she can't quite put her finger on what it is she wants.So when her old flame, Charlie (Ed Burns), returns from out west, she begins to wondermaybe he's an answer. Their past romance was a passionate one: He's the one that got away. But his California dreams have gone bust and he's back pumping gas just like he did in high school. At first Claudia resists Charlie, but he's got the lure of that first love you never quite get over and before long she finds herself back in his arms and agreeing to run off with him.Without being told, Michael knows what's happened and forces the inevitable confrontation. But Claudia's confusion gives way to clarity: she just doesn't love Michael the way he wants and she's not sure Charlie is the answer either.Day later, Claudia says goodbye to both Michael and Charlie.

I did, however, feel happy for her as she drove out of town to seek a new life that would captivate her imagination.  I think she did the right thing in staying with neither guy.No Looking Back is basically about relationships and how they affect your inner self and what you want out of life.  In this movie, the main character, Claudia seems content in her life, but when an ex-boyfriend returns to town and seeks her out, she is reminded of her previous ambitions and dreams and this causes her to become dissatisfied with her life.Interesting movie that is worth watching, though I find it to be pretty much forgettable(for me anyway).",3,Wonderful Music,998006400,"08 17, 2001",2001,941,"['completely', 'agree', 'many', 'other', 'music', 'great', 'used', 'beautifully', 'movie', 'give', 'right', 'feeling', 'scenes.The', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'found', 'impossible', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'Claudia', 'scene', 'where', 'Michael', 'break', 'up', 'did', 'however', 'feel', 'happy', 'drove', 'out', 'town', 'seek', 'new', 'life', 'would', 'captivate', 'imagination', 'think', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'staying', 'guy.No', 'Looking', 'Back', 'basically', 'relationships', 'how', 'affect', 'inner', 'self', 'what', 'want', 'life', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'Claudia', 'content', 'life', 'when', 'ex-boyfriend', 'returns', 'town', 'out', 'reminded', 'previous', 'ambitions', 'dreams', 'become', 'dissatisfied', 'life.Interesting', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'find', 'be', 'pretty', 'much', 'forgettable', 'anyway']",No Looking Back VHS
