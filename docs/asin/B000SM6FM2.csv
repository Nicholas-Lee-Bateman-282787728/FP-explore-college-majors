I've never been there, but I have to say that thanks to movies (including Hostel), I'm terrified of this region, and it obviously makes for a great horror movie setting, just as West Virginia does for movies having someone's car break down in the middle of the woods.  Despite the concept, though, the movie was just ok.  Characters were ok, but maybe there were too many characters that I didn't really enjoy any of them.  It just felt like the movie didn't know what it wanted to be.  It sold itself as a dark comedic horror, but the comic parts were far and few in-between.  That leaves dark horror; dark yes, horror, not so much.  However, I do have to say that I found the opening scene company advertisement video pretty amusing; the impossibly oxymoronic and immensely amusing (through the right lens) role that some of the defense industry plays in our lives is all too ignored in the media.",2,Good for a rental - only,1239580800,"04 13, 2009",2009,1011,"['Mildly', 'entertaining', 'bit', 'British', 'humor', 'set', 'impossibly', 'uncomfortable', 'nether', 'reaches', 'eastern', 'europe', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'there', 'have', 'say', 'thanks', 'movies', 'including', 'Hostel', ""'m"", 'terrified', 'region', 'obviously', 'great', 'horror', 'movie', 'setting', 'just', 'West', 'Virginia', 'movies', 'having', 'someone', 'car', 'break', 'down', 'middle', 'woods', 'concept', 'though', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'ok', 'Characters', 'were', 'ok', 'maybe', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'just', 'felt', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'sold', 'dark', 'comedic', 'horror', 'comic', 'parts', 'were', 'far', 'few', 'in-between', 'dark', 'horror', 'dark', 'yes', 'horror', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'However', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'found', 'opening', 'scene', 'company', 'advertisement', 'video', 'pretty', 'amusing', 'impossibly', 'oxymoronic', 'immensely', 'amusing', 'right', 'lens', 'role', 'defense', 'industry', 'lives', 'too', 'ignored', 'media']",Severance

You want to, in that hour or so, be transported to a plane of existence in which you laugh, cry, cringe or sigh. Horror movies aren't supposed to be great works in which you must be cerebrally challenged or in which you expect total originality. Every once and awhile one will come along that defines a new level of thinking, but for the most part you know you are going to get a formula that works.  A movie called ""Severance"" promises a lot of cuts, and in more ways than one.The set up is this; some employees of a company called Palisades (who manufactures weapons) are sent into the woods of eastern Europe There they are to meet up with their boss George at a luxury cabin and do team building exercises. Sounds simple enough, albeit every persons nightmare to have to blow a weekend falling into someone's arms and staring at the faces you try so hard to get away from on your time off!! Having been dropped off my a non English speaking bus driver, they must now hoof it to the cabin which may or may not be 1 mile to 10 miles depending on what your definition of an inch is on a map.Getting to this cabin they all realize, except for their fearless manager and his peppy assistant who has brought everything you could ever need in his bag , that they are not where they need to be and from there this turns into a gory, fun fest that should be mandatory viewing at any company retreat! Are they being hunted and by whom? Is it because of where they work or is it random? Who is getting ""cut"" next, and who will be the last coworker standing? All I know is that it was truly the best teambuilding exercise they could have hoped for and it didn't include playing charades or making bubble graphs. Some people have compared it toShaun of the Deadbecause of its dry humor and comical death scenes. I have also read a book recently calledSeverance Packagethat is about a company who manufacturs weapons and now has to shut down that branch and no one who works there gets out alive.

1086896,A2U5V1UHGZ65LA,B000SM6FM2,chance725,"[3, 3]","SEVERANCE is a very nice surprise - an unpretentious but satisfying  comedy-thriller that builds up a palpable sense of unease, before the killing starts.  The first half-hour is dry British comedy, and very well done - you end up liking ALL of the characters, even the annoying ones.  And suspense mounts, as you see these likeable characters moving deeper and deeper into danger. The horror, once it gets going, is brutal - and a little brutalizing to the viewer, as black comedy gives way to mostly humorless gore.  This slasher second-half is not quite up to the first half of the movie, with its original blend of office-politics comedy and menace.

Starting off as a satire of British office politics (like the British version of The Office) we move a little bumpily to a stylistic cousin to the torture porn movies of late. It's not a full on example of TP because the onscreen gore is not as extensively presented, but it's definitely related with travel to the Balkans region resulting in traps and murder from a mysterious figure. From here, though, the genrebending is a bit strained, as the filmmakers present a full on horror movie spotted with a stream of silly moments. Strangely, though this makes the movie at best watchable, everything I read prior to watching the movie indicated it's a small gem. Not so much. In addition to the horror/humor blending not working well, there are some script problems, especially in the area of whodunit and why. Still in all, the movie is watchable, and might be a decent option for those who like horror movies but shy away from the gore.

He is very good at building suspense, and he appears to be a real actor's director, managing to draw excellent performances from his casts. Severance is part dark comedy, part real live suspense thriller. The script is well-written, the ensemble cast has excellent chemistry, and each of the characters is clearly distinguishable from the others - no interchangeable cardboard cutouts here. The movie is more humorous in the beginning and middle, but the intensity builds the way you would hope it would in an action thriller.

1086903,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,B000SM6FM2,Genevieve Hayes,"[1, 9]","This film is marketed as a comic-horror film, but whichever way you look at it, this film failed. The first hour of this film is, presumably, meant to be the comic section. A group of employees of a UK arms manufacturing company are in Eastern Europe for a weekend of team building activities. After a small misunderstanding, the group's tour bus deserts them and they are left stranded in the middle of nowhere. There is much scope for both horror and comedy throughout this early section of the film, but none arises. The film just drags on, with very little of interest happening. Perhaps this was meant to build suspense, but as far as I was concerned, it just made me want to give up on the film.With the exception of one killing, in the opening scene, it takes about an hour (in a 90 minute movie) for the villains to arrive. Once they do arrive, the film degenates into torture-porn.

Send the group of them into the woods to a run-down military asylum where they are hunted like animals by blood-thirsty psychos, and you have the rip-roaring horror comedy that is Severance .--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well-made horror comedies are a rare find. When I say well-made, I don't mean that there aren't quite a few horror movies out there that have giddily funny moments. Movies like The Toxic Avenger may blur the line, but they rely more on camp than a purer comedic element. I think it has to do with believability. There are some horror movies that find comedy in how a normal person would react to an abnormal situation. Shaun of the Dead excelled in this to a great length. Scenes such as his zombified step-father going crazy until he could turn off the radio are classic in my eyes. Although in the movie the zombies may not be too believable, Shaun's obliviousness to the situation, and finally his reaction, seem plausible, and only minorly exaggerated at times.Enter Severance. The movie works much like Shaun of the Dead, and this is without reading other reviews which say the same damn thing without explaining why. It's true. The oblivious nature of the corporate employees of international weapons creator Palisade Defence is shown at the beginning, while they are all on a bus heading to their supposed safe destination at a ""luxury lodge."" It's a believable premise, complete with a tight-lipped staff manager(played by Tim McInnerny), a stoned-out techie(played by Danny Dyer), an anti-war hippie-type(played by Claudie Blakly), and a loveable, fat goon(played by Andy Nyman), among the rest of a stellar cast.When their bus driver kicks them off the bus in front of a road not entirely on the beaten path, the crew decide to walk in the hope of finding their destination. What they find is a run-down building that could only be the corporate lodge if their company were instigating this trip during these economic times. While exploring, they come upon paperwork linking their company to Russian military activity and soldier dossiers. With this information they concoct elaborate camp-fire like tales of what went on in the building, the most comical belonging to Danny Dyer.After the sighting of a peeping tom at a window, in the middle of this supposedly lifeless forest, the gang investigates a way to get the hell back to civilization, and are instead attacked by human-sized pygmies with guns, and fun times are had by all.Some of the great scenes in this movie, without giving too much away:-human meat pies-a happy anecdote about human heads remaining conscious for a time after being severed from their body, with a morbid punch-line-a rocket launcher gone awry-Danny Dyer saying, ""This is gonna hurt.""-Hot half-naked Scandanavian prostitutes with assault rifes",4,Another Great Horror Comedy,1260230400,"12 8, 2009",2009,3041,"['Take', 'Americanized', 'Office', 'television', 'show', 'make', 'British', 'again', 'change', 'paper', 'company', 'military', 'defense', 'company', 'Northrop', 'Grumman', 'more', 'accessible', 'friendly', 'Send', 'group', 'woods', 'run-down', 'military', 'asylum', 'where', 'are', 'hunted', 'animals', 'blood-thirsty', 'psychos', 'have', 'rip-roaring', 'horror', 'comedy', 'Severance', 'Well-made', 'horror', 'comedies', 'are', 'rare', 'find', 'When', 'say', 'well-made', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'few', 'horror', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'have', 'giddily', 'funny', 'moments', 'Movies', 'Toxic', 'Avenger', 'may', 'blur', 'line', 'rely', 'more', 'camp', 'purer', 'comedic', 'element', 'think', 'do', 'believability', 'are', 'horror', 'movies', 'find', 'comedy', 'how', 'normal', 'person', 'would', 'react', 'abnormal', 'situation', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'excelled', 'great', 'length', 'Scenes', 'such', 'zombified', 'step-father', 'going', 'crazy', 'could', 'turn', 'off', 'radio', 'are', 'classic', 'eyes', 'movie', 'zombies', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'believable', 'Shaun', 'obliviousness', 'situation', 'finally', 'reaction', 'seem', 'plausible', 'only', 'minorly', 'exaggerated', 'times.Enter', 'Severance', 'movie', 'much', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'say', 'same', 'damn', 'thing', 'explaining', 'why', 'true', 'oblivious', 'nature', 'corporate', 'employees', 'international', 'weapons', 'creator', 'Palisade', 'Defence', 'shown', 'beginning', 'are', 'bus', 'heading', 'supposed', 'safe', 'destination', 'luxury', 'lodge', 'believable', 'premise', 'complete', 'tight-lipped', 'staff', 'manager', 'played', 'Tim', 'McInnerny', 'stoned-out', 'techie', 'played', 'Danny', 'Dyer', 'anti-war', 'hippie-type', 'played', 'Claudie', 'Blakly', 'loveable', 'fat', 'goon', 'played', 'Andy', 'Nyman', 'rest', 'stellar', 'cast.When', 'bus', 'driver', 'off', 'bus', 'front', 'road', 'not', 'entirely', 'beaten', 'path', 'crew', 'decide', 'walk', 'hope', 'finding', 'destination', 'What', 'find', 'run-down', 'building', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'corporate', 'lodge', 'company', 'were', 'instigating', 'trip', 'economic', 'times', 'exploring', 'come', 'paperwork', 'linking', 'company', 'Russian', 'military', 'activity', 'soldier', 'dossiers', 'information', 'concoct', 'elaborate', 'camp-fire', 'tales', 'went', 'building', 'most', 'comical', 'belonging', 'Danny', 'Dyer.After', 'sighting', 'peeping', 'tom', 'window', 'middle', 'supposedly', 'lifeless', 'forest', 'gang', 'way', 'get', 'hell', 'back', 'civilization', 'are', 'instead', 'attacked', 'human-sized', 'pygmies', 'guns', 'fun', 'times', 'are', 'had', 'all.Some', 'great', 'scenes', 'movie', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', '-human', 'meat', 'pies-a', 'happy', 'anecdote', 'human', 'heads', 'remaining', 'conscious', 'time', 'being', 'severed', 'body', 'morbid', 'punch-line-a', 'rocket', 'launcher', 'gone', 'awry-Danny', 'Dyer', 'saying', 'gon', 'hurt', '-Hot', 'half-naked', 'Scandanavian', 'prostitutes', 'assault', 'rifes']",Severance

Considering it's a story bereft of humor, one would think this movie would rely on horror strength.  The only time I was mortified was when I realized it wasn't a zombie movie, and the actors were just that stiff.  It felt like a tired horror movie where nothing but clich&eacute;s are followed.Why does every generic horror movie have to start off with dimwits running aimlessly through a dark forest?  Why do they always fall?  When these idiots are murdered, isn't it just Darwin taking care of business?  The movie starts out in such a way as to cause me to ask these questions.  Three people running, all three get trapped, one who looks like a William Shatner clone gets gashed and his guts flow.The guts of the story, however, is about a team of weapons dealers - without weapons - in Eastern Europe on a team-building weekend.  They're the same brain-dead characters making the same perpetual mistakes.  Yuppies in a rural environment, wow, how original.  Naturally, their bus driver gets angry and leaves them.  Good job; get rid of your interpreter.  They hear strange noises; so, they begin walking into the forest towards the noises.  That's always smart.  They finally arrive at their cabin retreat, which looks like garbage - turns out it's an abandoned insane asylum.  Of course it is.  As part of their activities they tell stories they have heard about a place like the one in which they are staying.  The stories are unimportant except for the fact they serve as the weak device to advance a moronic plot.  They eat a meat-pie with a human tooth in it (insert British dentistry joke here).  There is yet another moron who steps in a bear trap.  Oops.  There's the typical decapitated head rolling on the ground and seeing its own body scene.  Wait, what?  Ok, so maybe it's not all unoriginal.The shining moment of this movie is a brilliant homage to the Nosferatu-era of silent cinema.  Stop motion movement, long fingernails, simple yet ominous makeup, wonderful usage of shadows, it's all there.  When the brief interlude ends, the remaining wind left in the movie's already sagging sails dissipates.For what it's worth, if I saw it listed on TV one night, I'd skip it for a Jeopardy repeat.",2,Yawn of the Dead,1224374400,"10 19, 2008",2008,2380,"['movie', 'billed', 'combination', 'Office', 'Space', 'Hostel', 'where', 'Brits', 'attempt', 'capitalize', 'horror/comedy', 'genre', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'disappointing', 'Considering', 'story', 'bereft', 'humor', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'rely', 'horror', 'strength', 'only', 'time', 'was', 'mortified', 'was', 'when', 'realized', 'was', ""n't"", 'zombie', 'movie', 'actors', 'were', 'just', 'stiff', 'felt', 'tired', 'horror', 'movie', 'where', 'nothing', 'clich', 'eacute', 'are', 'followed.Why', 'generic', 'horror', 'movie', 'have', 'start', 'off', 'dimwits', 'running', 'aimlessly', 'dark', 'forest', 'Why', 'do', 'always', 'fall', 'When', 'idiots', 'are', 'murdered', ""n't"", 'just', 'Darwin', 'taking', 'care', 'business', 'movie', 'out', 'such', 'way', 'cause', 'ask', 'questions', 'Three', 'people', 'running', 'three', 'get', 'trapped', 'one', 'who', 'William', 'Shatner', 'clone', 'gashed', 'guts', 'flow.The', 'guts', 'story', 'however', 'team', 'weapons', 'dealers', 'weapons', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'team-building', 'weekend', ""'re"", 'same', 'brain-dead', 'characters', 'making', 'same', 'perpetual', 'mistakes', 'Yuppies', 'rural', 'environment', 'wow', 'how', 'original', 'Naturally', 'bus', 'driver', 'angry', 'Good', 'job', 'get', 'rid', 'interpreter', 'hear', 'strange', 'noises', 'so', 'begin', 'walking', 'forest', 'noises', 'always', 'smart', 'finally', 'arrive', 'cabin', 'retreat', 'garbage', 'out', 'abandoned', 'insane', 'asylum', 'course', 'part', 'activities', 'tell', 'stories', 'have', 'heard', 'place', 'one', 'are', 'staying', 'stories', 'are', 'unimportant', 'fact', 'serve', 'weak', 'device', 'advance', 'moronic', 'plot', 'eat', 'meat-pie', 'human', 'tooth', 'insert', 'British', 'dentistry', 'joke', 'here', 'yet', 'moron', 'who', 'bear', 'trap', 'Oops', 'typical', 'decapitated', 'head', 'rolling', 'ground', 'seeing', 'own', 'body', 'scene', 'Wait', 'what', 'Ok', 'maybe', 'not', 'unoriginal.The', 'shining', 'moment', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'homage', 'Nosferatu-era', 'silent', 'cinema', 'Stop', 'motion', 'movement', 'long', 'fingernails', 'simple', 'yet', 'ominous', 'makeup', 'wonderful', 'usage', 'shadows', 'there', 'When', 'brief', 'interlude', 'ends', 'remaining', 'wind', 'left', 'movie', 'already', 'sagging', 'sails', 'dissipates.For', 'what', 'worth', 'saw', 'listed', 'TV', 'one', 'night', ""'d"", 'skip', 'Jeopardy', 'repeat']",Severance

Now the box's cover art claims this to be a comedy/horror flick in the same line as ""The Office"", & ""Shaun Of The Dead"".  Maybe I missed something, but I didn't get that.  While the movie does have it's moments, it's more amusing, than it is just straight out comedy.

These people happen to be employees of a weapons manufacturer.  Anyway there transpotation winds up breaking down on the way & they find a place out in the woods that they at 1st assume is the designated retreat area.  After that things start to get bloody and that's all you really need to know.

1086910,A34BP6PCVMX46G,B000SM6FM2,Jeff Eastwood,"[0, 0]","Easily one of the better horror movies I've seen in a while. I thought it had an excellent mix of comedy and gore and both were well-timed. The first half is all about the chuckles, whereas the second half was focusing on getting nasty. I don't get easily scared at films, but Severance made me jump more than most I've seen. The film is also very clever. For example, at one part the scary music starts to get louder and Harris (Toby Stephens) turns round in the usual ""there's something behind you"" way, and the sound of a knife sharpening is heard. But then it quickly changes to the next scene where it shows another character sharpening a knife to cut some cheese. I've never seen this technique used in a movie before, but it works so well. Getting you tense and ready for something to happen and then nothing happens. Thus the viewer relax only to be scared by a quick scary moment that follows. It's like a mind trick. The deaths are great, ranging from machete to bear trap, sliced stomach to flamethrower.The ending is great and fits the movie well. Also, the killers aren't superhuman. They are realistic, everyday psychopaths that are trying to kill a group of people. So it doesn't take a full clip of white hot lead to take one out, all it takes is a smack to the head with a rock. Overall a great film that is must see for horror fans or lovers of pitch-black comedies.

In ""Severance,"" a group of defense workers goes off on a corporate retreat (""team building"") and are confronted by a menace. But what is facing them is not just some unseen killer, no, it's the terror of an unforgiving public who's been there, done that. They don't just have to win over the attacker -- they have to win over the audience as well. Or should I say that's the challenge of writer-director Christopher Smith, and he succeeds with ease.Several gruesome moments seem like bait for gore-mongers, since the film would work perfectly well without them, but are well-done and there is enough character development at the front end of the movie to make you care when the blood starts to flow. I thought the characters were consistent enough (and surprising enough) to behave like real human beings, instead of turning into horror movie cliches. There's Danny Dyer's Steve who is still able to provide comic relief in a film that's already quite satirical. The goal of this trip is a little R&R;, but Steve misread it as sex and drugs and R&R.; He is a standout here. A fierce American female played by Laura Harris who shines as Maggie who maintains her tough exterior without turning into Laura Croft. Toby Stephens, Claudie Blakley, Andy Nyman, Babou Ceesay, and Tim McInnerny all turn in perfectly lighthearted performances while remaining frighteningly real. The exploitation of horror movie clich&eacute;s by turning some of them inside out also generates a good portion of the humor. There are also enough surprises to keep you intrigued - one stabbing looks so painful it'll make you think twice before kicking anyone in the butt. ""Severance"" looks like a big budget film but with Indie sensibility.Another thing that I found interesting on this disc were some of the special features. The one special feature about all of the bad effects was actually very amusing especially when the one effects ""master"" admitted that he had no desire to work in film but got into the business when he saw how much it paid.

Some films just fall into that netherland in between a 3 and a 4 and SEVERANCE is one of them. It isn't the laff riot that I expected but it does offer moments of dark humor though not as much as I had been led to believe. In fact it has one very clever sequence based on the silent version of NOSFERATU that was one of the best things I've seen in years--unfortunately the film makers couldn't sustain that level of creativity for the entire 90 minute running time. There were other things I admired, to be sure. Such as some of the surprises they pulled out of their bag in relation to the identity of the killer. I liked the fact that there was no solid background for him, that all we know is what the characters gave us themselves as they sat around the table telling different stories they had heard in the past.SEVERANCE isn't exactly a carnage fest either. There is gore aplenty but if you're looking for eviscerations you aren't going to find them here. And those of you looking for nudity are going to have to wait until the last few minutes to see four breasts. The plot concerns a group of Brits employed by a weapons manufacturer. They are on corporate retreat in Rumania or some such place when their bus breaks down, their driver deserts them,and they decide to hike to what they presume to be their lodge. Wrong.

Unfortunately, most movies that attempt this combination end up a bit corny with the comedy rendering the horror less effective or the horror taking precedence over real humor.  It is rare that you encounter a hybrid film with genuine wit and intelligence--but that is just what the delightfully unexpected ""Severance"" supplies.  Having never heard of this British slasher film, I was absolutely blown away by how much I enjoyed it!  In this corporate slasher satire (how's that for a categorization?), I laughed out loud AND was pleasantly swept up in the carnage!  Director Christopher Smith deserves much credit for this expert balance.When representatives of an weapons manufacturing company head out to a corporate retreat in Eastern Europe (you get what you pay for), they soon find themselves stranded in an abandoned facility that may have housed controversial goings-on.  As the team find themselves confronted with a killer, and possibly more than one, it's an all out battle for survival.  Danny Dyer is hysterical as a doper lackey and Laura Harris is perfect as the object of everyone's desire. But the entire cast really shines in selling this tale.  A decapitated head (of my favorite actor in the film, no less) brings one of the film's best moments and settles a previous debate to great affect.  And two escorts hired by Dyer are no less than genius as they are incorporated brilliantly into the action.  Truly memorable, truly funny!I have already recommended this film to several people and I only just watched it.  I know I may be late to the party seeing that this was released several years ago--but better late than never.  If you like this sort of thing, I think you'll really appreciate ""Severance!""  If you don't, I'm not sure that this will convert you.

I told my wife about it (she would scarcely condescend to watch a movie like this), and she even laughed out loud at my simple description of the scene in question.  ""Severance"" is one of those movies where you want to work out the math to figure out the bits and pieces you see director Christopher Smith and his screenwriting partner James Moran mixing up in this 2006 film.  Basically take the gang from ""The Office,"" have them sell weapons instead of paper like in ""Lord of War,"" put them deep in the woods like whatever your favorite deep in the woods horror film might be (e.g., ""The Blair Witch Project"" if you are under 30, butDeliverance"" if you are over), and do ""The Most Dangerous Game"" bit.  I know it seems like ""Shaun of the Dead"" would be an obvious comparison for a movie like this that wants to blend horror and comedy, but ""Severance"" is going to suffer in that sort of comparison.  However, compare it to your standard horror film (which more often than not is direct to video these days), and this one looks pretty good.So go along with the idea that sending the sales team for a munitions maker to a lodge somewhere in Eastern Europe for team building exercises.  The team leader (Tim McInnerny) is not a leader, but then he does not really have a team.  Laura Harris from ""Dead Like Me"" is the most recognizable face and clearly not a dumb blonde, so you expect here to be around at the end.  The rest of them are you regular smorgasbord of future dead meat, from the pothead (Danny Dyer) and the brown-noser (Andy Nyman) to the minority person (Babou Ceesay) and the brunette with the glasses (Claudie Blakley).  The setting is Hungary and after the war in Bosnia and torture-porn films like ""Hostel"" there is a real sense that Eastern Europe is basically a giant death trap (but a cheap place to make movies).  Where once there were Nazis and then psychotic Vietnam Vets, now there are thugs from Eastern Europe as the villains du jour.  At least this time around randomness is not a part of the equation, although that particular plotline is raised late and not exploit for anything remotely like what it would be worth.The slightly askew tone of the film is set early on when the standard scene of two buxom blondes running screaming through a forest is juxtaposed with classical music well suited to a ballet, and continues right through the end credits, where we get a different version of the same song that gets played at the end of ""Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.""  It was nice for once to see people with college degrees being killed off one by one after all those countless dead teenager movies that have always made up most of the horror genre.  Their occupation also comes into play in a couple of key ways, not only because of the idea that such merchants of death deserve to die horrible deaths, but also because these people know about weapons (now they just have to survive long enough to get their hands on some and use them).  ""Severance"" is not always successful in trying to have it both way and even if the sick humor is makes for the films most memorable moments there are a few chilling bits as well (it helps that Harris plays it from start to finish like she is in a horror film).  This was the most entertaining horror film I have seen in some time, which may not mean much given the dreck I have watched this past summer, but from my vantage point looks like the top of the mole hill.",5,Walking the bloody and slippery line between comedy and horror,1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,3597,"['had', 'round', 'up', 'Severance', 'simply', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'horror', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'told', 'wife', 'would', 'scarcely', 'condescend', 'watch', 'movie', 'even', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'simple', 'description', 'scene', 'question', 'Severance', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'want', 'work', 'out', 'math', 'figure', 'out', 'bits', 'pieces', 'see', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Smith', 'screenwriting', 'partner', 'James', 'Moran', 'mixing', 'up', '2006', 'film', 'Basically', 'take', 'gang', 'Office', 'have', 'sell', 'weapons', 'instead', 'paper', 'Lord', 'War', 'put', 'deep', 'woods', 'favorite', 'deep', 'woods', 'horror', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'e.g.', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'are', '30', 'butDeliverance', 'are', 'do', 'Most', 'Dangerous', 'Game', 'bit', 'know', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'would', 'be', 'obvious', 'comparison', 'movie', 'blend', 'horror', 'comedy', 'Severance', 'going', 'suffer', 'sort', 'comparison', 'However', 'compare', 'standard', 'horror', 'film', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'direct', 'video', 'days', 'one', 'pretty', 'good.So', 'go', 'along', 'idea', 'sending', 'sales', 'team', 'munitions', 'maker', 'lodge', 'somewhere', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'team', 'building', 'exercises', 'team', 'leader', 'Tim', 'McInnerny', 'not', 'leader', 'then', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'team', 'Laura', 'Harris', 'Dead', 'Me', 'most', 'recognizable', 'face', 'clearly', 'not', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'expect', 'here', 'be', 'around', 'end', 'rest', 'are', 'regular', 'smorgasbord', 'future', 'dead', 'meat', 'pothead', 'Danny', 'Dyer', 'brown-noser', 'Andy', 'Nyman', 'minority', 'person', 'Babou', 'Ceesay', 'brunette', 'glasses', 'Claudie', 'Blakley', 'setting', 'Hungary', 'war', 'Bosnia', 'torture-porn', 'films', 'Hostel', 'real', 'sense', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'basically', 'giant', 'death', 'trap', 'cheap', 'place', 'make', 'movies', 'Where', 'once', 'were', 'Nazis', 'then', 'psychotic', 'Vietnam', 'Vets', 'now', 'are', 'thugs', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'villains', 'du', 'jour', 'least', 'time', 'randomness', 'not', 'part', 'equation', 'particular', 'plotline', 'raised', 'late', 'not', 'exploit', 'anything', 'remotely', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'worth.The', 'slightly', 'askew', 'tone', 'film', 'set', 'early', 'when', 'standard', 'scene', 'two', 'buxom', 'blondes', 'running', 'screaming', 'forest', 'juxtaposed', 'classical', 'music', 'well', 'suited', 'ballet', 'right', 'end', 'credits', 'where', 'get', 'different', 'version', 'same', 'song', 'played', 'end', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'How', 'Learned', 'Stop', 'Worrying', 'Love', 'Bomb', 'was', 'nice', 'once', 'see', 'people', 'college', 'degrees', 'being', 'killed', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'countless', 'dead', 'teenager', 'movies', 'have', 'always', 'made', 'up', 'most', 'horror', 'genre', 'occupation', 'also', 'play', 'couple', 'key', 'ways', 'not', 'only', 'idea', 'such', 'merchants', 'death', 'deserve', 'die', 'horrible', 'deaths', 'also', 'people', 'know', 'weapons', 'now', 'just', 'have', 'survive', 'long', 'enough', 'get', 'hands', 'use', 'Severance', 'not', 'always', 'successful', 'trying', 'have', 'way', 'even', 'sick', 'humor', 'films', 'most', 'memorable', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'chilling', 'bits', 'as', 'well', 'Harris', 'start', 'finish', 'horror', 'film', 'was', 'most', 'entertaining', 'horror', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'time', 'may', 'not', 'mean', 'much', 'given', 'dreck', 'have', 'watched', 'past', 'summer', 'vantage', 'point', 'top', 'mole', 'hill']",Severance

Obviously this isn't enough to look a a movie and say ""this is going to be a classic."" (And, spoiler alert: it isn't.) But you've got Christopher Smith, whose specialty is taking tired old storylines and injecting them with new life, attacking the horror/comedy slasher film. What's not to like? Even better, he got Danny Dyer to be in it (and Danny Dyer's career in horror comedies got very, very busy after this). So you've already got a strong point before you start the movie.The plot is fairly simple (and, as with all Christopher Smith outings, you've seen it before): a busload of corporate hacks are on their way to a country lodge for one of those team-building exercises. Something goes horribly wrong, they get off track, and end up wandering through the woods until they hit on what their manager believes to be the right lodge, creepy-looking and abandoned as it is... and eventually they realize that their resting place is not nearly as secluded as they think.As it's a Christopher Smith movie, you can bank on a few things. The script is going to contain all kinds of touches of humor that you might miss if you're not paying attention (the bit with Danny Dyer and the tooth is hilarious), the twist ending is going to be loaded with irony, the cast is going to turn in excellent performances (in some cases the best in their careers). All of these things are true of Severance, and yet I found myself not liking it quite as much as I liked Black Death or Creep.  I can't quite tell you why this is. Maybe because I'm so much more familiar with the genre, or maybe because this genre's been trod so many times that, let's face it, there's not a great deal Smith could do to revitalize it? (To be fair, while the big ironic twist is kind of predictable, it's still funny as hell, in a grim sort of way.) And I certainly don't mean to imply that I didn't like the thing, or that it's not a fun, watchable, addition to the Christopher Smith canon, because I did enjoy it, and if I were to stumble upon it while flipping channels at a friend's house some night it's something I would stick around and catch the end of again.

Seven employees - ironically enough of an arms-manufacturing firm - head off to the forests of Eastern Europe (the new locale-of-choice for the modern horror film, it would appear) for a weekend of corporate-sponsored team-building and morale-boosting.  Their adventure turns into a nightmare, however, as the members of the party are hunted down and brutally murdered by a mask-wearing, weapons-wielding serial killer with serious developmental issues.  Meat cleavers, serrated knives, blow torches, machine guns - no tool is too crude or too sophisticated for our intrepid little psychopath to employ in the course of his business.  This is supposed to make him a sort of homegrown version of the company people he`s killing, I suppose, but the movie is frankly too dumbed-down and lunk-headed for such heavy-handed ironies to register much of an impact.Though it is efficiently executed and reasonably well acted, ""Severance"" doesn't bring anything new to a genre whose modus operandi was pretty much set in stone once ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" laid down the original blueprint thirty some odd years ago.  As with most such films, the majority of the thrills come in the earlier sequences before the nature of the threat has been fully revealed.  Once that occurs, however, the movie devolves into yet another monotonous gore-fest, with only a trace of that trademark British cheekiness to distinguish it from the countless other slasher movies that have come before it.

Miskowski,"[2, 2]","Directed by Christopher SmithWritten by James Moran & Christopher SmithAny intelligent person forced to take part in an office team-building exercise knows how easy it would be to slip from controlled corporate rage to homicide. The creators of Severance understand that feeling. In place of traditional slasher film targets (such as obnoxious teenagers) they have substituted the people we most want to see mutilated and murdered: co-workers.When their bus breaks down somewhere in an Eastern European forest, several sales employees of the multi-national Palisade Defence have to schlep their belongings to the nearest hotel. There they await instructions from the American executive who planned their trip. The hotel turns out to be a moldy inn equipped with no amenities except weird pie. And every step outside the place lands the unhappy employees in (often excruciating) peril.Acting TalentThanks to a terrific cast that includes Laura Harris, Danny Dyer, and Tim McInnerny (Lord Percy Percy and Capt. Darling of Blackadder fame) there is no need for over-the-top special effects. Don't get me wrong; what is here is truly horrific. But the point of view makes it so. For example, there's a scene in which a character sees something that gets his feet moving a lot faster--only we don't see what he sees. We see the sheer, animal terror in his eyes, and this is just as effective as anything the props department could have dreamed up.PlausibilityWhile some horror filmmakers court plausibility with computer graphics, Christopher Smith makes the bolder and more disturbing choice to go natural. All the stunts and threats come from realistic or believable objects, relations, and circumstances. The style works; it hurts to watch.WitA couple of the best jokes in this film are a long time coming. Yet they're set up so expertly, you recognize every punch line the second it arrives.StoryYou'll spend about half the film trying to figure out if the force preying on our busload of working stiffs is supernatural, psychological, or real.

Led by their uptight manager Richard (Tim McInnerny), the team locates what they believe is the lodge.  During the night, Jill (Claudie Blakely) is frightened by a figure she sees in the woods.  The following day, Jill and Harris (Toby Stephens) leave to try and call for help, while the rest of the team engages in a little paintball warfare.  Unfortunately both groups discover that there is great danger in the woods, as Gordon (Andy Nyman) steps into some major trouble, and the bus driver is found dead.  The group attempts to escape in the bus, but only disaster awaits them.Severance is generally well-written, incorporating humor that often comes from some twisted angle.  The film moves at a brisk pace, and benefits from a talented ensemble cast that does a terrific job with the material.  It effectively builds a connection with the characters, giving you an idea of who they are.  Eventually emerging as the leads, Andy Dyer and Laura Harris give some rock solid performances, including some rugged action scenes.  As the drug abusing Steve, the gangly Dyer seems like an unlikely hero.The threat from what appear to be renegade Russian soldiers isn't really explained.  Fortunately for the Palisade group, the soldiers do not make a direct attack, and seem to be toying with the visitors, taking out the most helpless first.  Perhaps discipline is a little lax after being in the woods for so long, as the civilians give these soldiers all they can handle.  The level of action picks up nicely near the end, as Maggie (Harris) is dodging a flame thrower and in some need of assistance.For those who appreciate the terror in the woods genre, Severance is a bloody good time, offering a welcome change of pace, with some fairly sensible adult characters, a dark British sense of humor, tense edgy scares, and gritty action with a variety of violence.  The DVD has a solid complement of extras, including deleted scenes, some making of featurettes, and a ""boys having fun"" type commentary with Christopher Smith, Danny Dyer, Tim McInnerny, and others in the cast.",4,deadly east European getaway for the staff of Palisade Defence...,1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,2608,"['Employees', 'arms', 'manufacturing', 'company', 'corporate', 'retreat', 'somewhere', 'eastern', 'Europe', 'run', 'heavy', 'duty', 'trouble', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Smith', 'Black', 'Death', 'Triangle', 'Severance', '2006', 'dark', 'horror', 'comedy', 'quirky', 'likeable', 'characters', 'brutal', 'kills', 'different', 'spin', 'typical', 'terror', 'woods', 'tale.The', 'executives', 'sales', 'division', 'Palisade', 'Defence', 'are', 'bus', 'way', 'lodge', 'woods', 'bit', 'corporate', 'team', 'building', 'when', 'driver', 'out', 'Led', 'uptight', 'manager', 'Richard', 'Tim', 'McInnerny', 'team', 'what', 'believe', 'lodge', 'night', 'Jill', 'Claudie', 'Blakely', 'frightened', 'figure', 'woods', 'following', 'day', 'Jill', 'Harris', 'Toby', 'Stephens', 'leave', 'try', 'call', 'help', 'rest', 'team', 'little', 'paintball', 'warfare', 'Unfortunately', 'groups', 'discover', 'great', 'danger', 'woods', 'Gordon', 'Andy', 'Nyman', 'major', 'trouble', 'bus', 'driver', 'found', 'dead', 'group', 'escape', 'bus', 'only', 'disaster', 'awaits', 'them.Severance', 'generally', 'well-written', 'incorporating', 'humor', 'often', 'twisted', 'angle', 'film', 'moves', 'brisk', 'pace', 'benefits', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'terrific', 'job', 'material', 'effectively', 'connection', 'characters', 'giving', 'idea', 'who', 'are', 'Eventually', 'emerging', 'leads', 'Andy', 'Dyer', 'Laura', 'Harris', 'give', 'rock', 'solid', 'performances', 'including', 'rugged', 'action', 'scenes', 'drug', 'abusing', 'Steve', 'gangly', 'Dyer', 'unlikely', 'hero.The', 'threat', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'renegade', 'Russian', 'soldiers', ""n't"", 'really', 'explained', 'Fortunately', 'Palisade', 'group', 'soldiers', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'direct', 'attack', 'seem', 'be', 'toying', 'visitors', 'taking', 'out', 'most', 'helpless', 'first', 'Perhaps', 'discipline', 'little', 'lax', 'being', 'woods', 'so', 'long', 'civilians', 'give', 'soldiers', 'can', 'handle', 'level', 'action', 'up', 'nicely', 'end', 'Maggie', 'Harris', 'dodging', 'flame', 'thrower', 'need', 'assistance.For', 'who', 'appreciate', 'terror', 'woods', 'genre', 'Severance', 'bloody', 'good', 'time', 'offering', 'welcome', 'change', 'pace', 'fairly', 'sensible', 'adult', 'characters', 'dark', 'British', 'sense', 'humor', 'tense', 'edgy', 'scares', 'gritty', 'action', 'variety', 'violence', 'DVD', 'solid', 'complement', 'extras', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'making', 'featurettes', 'boys', 'having', 'fun', 'type', 'commentary', 'Christopher', 'Smith', 'Danny', 'Dyer', 'Tim', 'McInnerny', 'others', 'cast']",Severance
