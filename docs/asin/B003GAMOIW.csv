It may seem a bit out there or far-fetched, but, trust me, it works! Matt Damon and Emily Blunt have amazing chemistry together; it's easy to root for these two as they take on the agency that's doing everything within their unlimited power to keep them apart. The movie, based on a story by Philip K. Dick (also responsible forBlade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition),Paycheck (Special Collector's Edition),Minority Report (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition),Total Recall,A Scanner Darkly,Screamers,Next), does well with its story and pacing. The acting is well done and it definitely has ""multiple viewing"" potential (especially for fans of Damon and Blunt). The great thing about this film, though, is not just the overall idea of the film, but also the questions that arise from such a film. Would you sacrifice a better life for your love?

1345054,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003GAMOIW,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","`The Adjustment Bureau' is one of those movies that works so long as you don't try and take it too seriously.  Once you start to break apart the film's elements, it becomes a bizarrely campy mess and it starts to lean on the `stupid' side of things.  The performances by Damon and Blunt are great and they go a long way to making this premise work, but unlike most film adaptations of Philip K. Dick's work, `The Adjustment Bureau' feels kind of corny.The Bureau itself is an obvious figurative peak at God and his angels poking around at the fate or `free will' of us humans.  The way they are depicted is rather shallow and almost laughable (their introduction on the rooftop made me laugh) and the film really fails to flesh them out, despite trying to (especially with the Harry character).  The film plods along rather well and then dives into lunacy when the final ten minutes roll around and director George Nolfi slams his foot on the gas pedal and the film steamrolls to its finale.  The `Monster's Inc.' type door escapes can be pretty cool (and the special effects are top notch) but they also get rather redundant.  The love story is underdeveloped (love at first site isn't always the most logical plot point) and overall this film winds up being a missed opportunity.  Add to the mix the ridiculous `hat' idea and you have a film that flirts with a depth it isn't willing to embrace.  Instead, it meanders at a decently entertaining action thriller with a charismatic lead performance.",3,Needed a few adjustments...,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,1499,"['Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'one', 'movies', 'so', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'Once', 'start', 'break', 'apart', 'film', 'elements', 'bizarrely', 'campy', 'mess', 'lean', 'stupid', 'side', 'things', 'performances', 'Damon', 'Blunt', 'are', 'great', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'premise', 'work', 'most', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'work', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'feels', 'kind', 'corny.The', 'Bureau', 'obvious', 'figurative', 'peak', 'God', 'angels', 'poking', 'around', 'fate', 'free', 'will', 'humans', 'way', 'are', 'depicted', 'rather', 'shallow', 'almost', 'laughable', 'introduction', 'rooftop', 'made', 'film', 'really', 'flesh', 'out', 'trying', 'especially', 'Harry', 'character', 'film', 'plods', 'rather', 'well', 'then', 'lunacy', 'when', 'final', 'ten', 'minutes', 'roll', 'around', 'director', 'George', 'Nolfi', 'slams', 'foot', 'gas', 'pedal', 'film', 'finale', 'Monster', 'Inc.', 'type', 'door', 'escapes', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'cool', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'also', 'get', 'rather', 'redundant', 'love', 'story', 'underdeveloped', 'love', 'first', 'site', ""n't"", 'always', 'most', 'logical', 'plot', 'point', 'overall', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'Add', 'mix', 'ridiculous', 'hat', 'idea', 'have', 'film', 'depth', ""n't"", 'willing', 'embrace', 'Instead', 'decently', 'entertaining', 'action', 'thriller', 'charismatic', 'lead', 'performance']",The Adjustment Bureau [DVD]

Well, it's both and I believe it does both genres very well.The sci-fi element, the Adjustment Bureau, is very well presented and fittingly creepy while also thought provoking as all good sci-fi should be. The key here is that the romance/love interest is not just tacked on to try to lure the female audience in but is essential to the plot. The romance is the plot. And that makes all the difference.Well acted, well-written, well shot with some very nicely done effects, The Adjustment Bureau does not merely straddle the line between action movie/romance, but, rather, becomes almost a genre unto itself.The movie is very entertaining.

1345056,A25BZHDKHNGD1D,B003GAMOIW,Angelica C. Driskell,"[2, 2]","The Adjustment Bureau, directed by George Nolfi, is an action packed romance movie that captivates from beginning to end. David Norris (Matt Damon) is a rising New York politician who has a chance meeting with a professional dancer, Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) that completely changes his life. The two fall madly in love and must deal with divine powers trying to keep them apart in a battle between free will and fate. This is a thought provoking film which challenges personal beliefs regarding a higher power and creates an interesting plot. Although I believe in free will, the possibility of ""Adjusters"" or ""Angels"" guiding our lives and keeping us on a predetermined path is intriguing. It makes me wonder what my life would look like if I chose another path or had an ""Adjuster"" correcting my mistakes.The chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt is intense and enhances the believability of David and Elise's emotions. The intimacy and impulsiveness of their first kiss leaves me feeling like they are meant to be together. Although this adds to the predictability of the ending, I appreciate David's determination to win Elise. Since I am a hopeless romantic, watching a man fight for the love of his life is very appealing.The cinematography is very well done and the special effects create a visually exciting chase scene through Manhattan. The seamless transition as the characters move supernaturally through doors all over the city is mesmerizing. After living and working in Manhattan for many years, the backdrop evokes a feeling of nostalgia and makes me a little biased towards movies set in New York City. The music of Thomas Newman, one of my favorite film score composers, is engaging and compliments the feeling of romance between David and Elise, as well stimulates the action scenes throughout the film.The Adjustment Bureau is entertaining and emotionally gratifying with a love conquers all theme. I look forward to watching again.The Adjustment Bureau. Dir. George Nolfi. Perf.

1345057,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B003GAMOIW,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[0, 1]","I watched The Adjustment Bureau with my hubby last night and I quite enjoyed it. This movie is about a young American politician who meet Elise, an eccentric dancer and fells in love with her. Now this could be your typical two people from different creeds in society meet and fall inappropriately in love kind of story, and it is, except this movie bring a twist to the old and tried concept, the Adjustment Bureau. Now as it turns out there are these gentlemen in suits and hats that walk around making sure things go according to plan, and the plan say that our hero and Elise is not to be together. The Adjustment Bureau deals with free will versus destiny as well as introducing a very interesting take on God, angels and the nature of reality. The Adjustment Bureau is what you would get if The Matrix and Dark City sat down one night to watch The American President together but in the middle of the movie they decided to make love instead and had a baby.The Adjustment Bureau have a good story, it is well phased and have enough humor to make it delightful without ruining the serious tone of many of the scenes. By the end of it you really do cheer for David and Elise to get to stay together. The actors all do a great job and the music works well with the movie even if it is pretty forgettable. All in all The Adjustment Bureau is a good movie, here however I have one gripe with this flick, it seams like the creators of this movie decided to play it safe. The Adjustment Bureau is good, but it is not great, it do not take any chances. This could have been an amazing film, but as it is it is entertaining and fulfilling but like it's music it is forgettable.Another gripe I have with this movie is Elise. Now I know the director wanted her to be delightfully whimsical, but she is not she is at times just stupid. Ok so she is an adult woman who crashes a wedding just for fun? No reason for it, just fun, seams a bit childish to me, but fine the case workers (the men in hats) could have made her do that, but later when Elise meet David on the bus, and keep in mind they have known one another for five seconds here, she takes his new several hundred dollars work phone and put it in his cup of coffee! Who do that? Is it supposed to be cute? And if so who would find having their very expensive work phone destroyed on a whimsical whim by a woman they have just met? That bus scene really made it hard for me to suspend disbelief because it was just so stupid. I know it is just one scene and the rest of the movie is good, but when the heroine in a love story is presented as half insane, selfish and destructive in one of the first scenes where the main characters interact it get a bit difficult to take the relationship between the main characters serious later in the movie. In general The Adjustment Bureau had been a more powerful film if that F***** Blueberry had never ended up in a cup of coffee.The Adjustment Bureau is not perfect, not by a long stretch, it pay it safe and while it is never boring the movie is forgettable, it is one of those flicks that do not have any impact on you but when one of your friends mention it a while later you go, humm...ah...yes I think I have seen that, it was pretty good what I can remember, but other than that it will just fade from memory. I do however think The Adjustment Bureau is worth a watch, especially if you are a fan of movies like the Matrix or Dark City. I recommend this movie as a buy as a few months after you have seen it you will have completely forgotten about the movie and can then enjoy discovering the story all over again, it is a never ending bundle of joy that way, and now that I think about it, good but forgettable can actually be a winning combination on the home entertainment marked. :P",4,An interesting take on the old big brother see you conspiracy concept.,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,3788,"['watched', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'hubby', 'last', 'night', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'young', 'American', 'politician', 'who', 'Elise', 'eccentric', 'dancer', 'fells', 'love', 'Now', 'could', 'be', 'typical', 'two', 'people', 'different', 'creeds', 'society', 'meet', 'fall', 'inappropriately', 'love', 'kind', 'story', 'movie', 'bring', 'twist', 'old', 'tried', 'concept', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'Now', 'out', 'are', 'gentlemen', 'suits', 'hats', 'walk', 'making', 'sure', 'things', 'go', 'according', 'plan', 'plan', 'say', 'hero', 'Elise', 'not', 'be', 'together', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'deals', 'free', 'will', 'versus', 'destiny', 'as', 'well', 'introducing', 'very', 'interesting', 'take', 'God', 'angels', 'nature', 'reality', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'what', 'would', 'get', 'Matrix', 'Dark', 'City', 'sat', 'down', 'one', 'night', 'watch', 'American', 'President', 'together', 'middle', 'movie', 'decided', 'make', 'love', 'instead', 'had', 'baby.The', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'have', 'good', 'story', 'well', 'phased', 'have', 'enough', 'humor', 'make', 'delightful', 'ruining', 'serious', 'tone', 'many', 'scenes', 'end', 'really', 'do', 'cheer', 'David', 'Elise', 'get', 'stay', 'together', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'music', 'well', 'movie', 'even', 'pretty', 'forgettable', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'good', 'movie', 'here', 'however', 'have', 'one', 'gripe', 'flick', 'creators', 'movie', 'decided', 'play', 'safe', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'chances', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'amazing', 'film', 'entertaining', 'fulfilling', 'music', 'forgettable.Another', 'gripe', 'have', 'movie', 'Elise', 'Now', 'know', 'director', 'wanted', 'be', 'delightfully', 'whimsical', 'not', 'times', 'just', 'stupid', 'adult', 'woman', 'who', 'wedding', 'just', 'fun', 'reason', 'just', 'fun', 'bit', 'childish', 'fine', 'case', 'workers', 'men', 'hats', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'do', 'later', 'when', 'Elise', 'meet', 'David', 'bus', 'keep', 'mind', 'have', 'known', 'one', 'five', 'seconds', 'here', 'new', 'several', 'hundred', 'dollars', 'work', 'phone', 'put', 'cup', 'coffee', 'Who', 'do', 'supposed', 'be', 'cute', 'so', 'who', 'would', 'find', 'having', 'very', 'expensive', 'work', 'phone', 'destroyed', 'whimsical', 'whim', 'woman', 'have', 'just', 'met', 'scene', 'really', 'made', 'hard', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'stupid', 'know', 'just', 'one', 'scene', 'rest', 'movie', 'good', 'when', 'heroine', 'love', 'story', 'presented', 'half', 'insane', 'selfish', 'destructive', 'one', 'first', 'scenes', 'where', 'main', 'characters', 'interact', 'get', 'bit', 'difficult', 'take', 'relationship', 'main', 'characters', 'serious', 'later', 'movie', 'general', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'powerful', 'film', 'F*****', 'Blueberry', 'had', 'never', 'ended', 'up', 'cup', 'coffee.The', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'not', 'perfect', 'not', 'long', 'stretch', 'pay', 'safe', 'never', 'boring', 'movie', 'forgettable', 'one', 'flicks', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'impact', 'when', 'one', 'friends', 'mention', 'while', 'later', 'go', 'humm', 'ah', 'yes', 'think', 'have', 'seen', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'what', 'can', 'remember', 'other', 'will', 'just', 'fade', 'memory', 'do', 'however', 'think', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'watch', 'especially', 'are', 'fan', 'movies', 'Matrix', 'Dark', 'City', 'recommend', 'movie', 'buy', 'few', 'months', 'have', 'seen', 'will', 'have', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'movie', 'can', 'then', 'enjoy', 'discovering', 'story', 'over', 'again', 'never', 'ending', 'bundle', 'joy', 'way', 'now', 'think', 'good', 'forgettable', 'can', 'actually', 'be', 'winning', 'combination', 'home', 'entertainment', 'marked', 'P']",The Adjustment Bureau [DVD]

1345066,A2582KMXLK2P06,B003GAMOIW,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","The Adjustment Bureau is quite the surprise.  It's a romance/science fiction type movie and... at first I didn't see how it was remotely possible to blend these two drastically different styles together and make something watchable, but after witnessing it I now see how!Let it be known that I'm a humongous fan of movie concepts that are just plain *different*.  I honestly can't imagine anything else resembling the Adjustment Bureau.  It's definitely unique.  Leading viewers into thinking this is going to be yet another election/politician type plotline and then morphing into pure science fiction is a genius and *incredibly* surprising move.Many complaints that I've read are that the plot is difficult to follow.  It's actually remarkably SIMPLE to follow- it's just that it's unbelievably different from everything else out there that it's hard to wrap your head around the concept.It's about these mysterious uniform-wearing men that make special appearances before Matt Damon's character.  These men exist to make sure people do things ""according to plan"".  The word ""plan"" is a frequently mentioned theme while watching the movie.  You'll hear this word a thousand times, believe me.  These men don't really have a specific name, and at first their presence is hard to understand because they just *appear* under mysterious conditions, so you're not really sure what to think about them until the film gets going.Well it turns out these men are convinced that Matt Damon's character has the potential to make a significant impact in his future concerning his role as a politician, so they always appear before him in a firm attempt to make sure he sets on the right course without any distractions, however...Matt Damon meets a beautiful woman that he falls in love with (of course, just *look* at her!) and every time he loses contact with the woman, he meets her again by total chance either during a bus ride or while walking down the city sidewalk, which means this is NOT part of the plan!  Uh oh!  This means the mysterious men are going to cause trouble for poor Matt.  This means, according to the storyline, anything that goes against the plan will result in Matt's memory being erased.Well... that particular aspect seems to fall by the wayside after a while, because later on the strange men demand Matt Damon's character to make a really difficult decision- either break up the relationship with the girl so Matt can eventually become a powerful leader (I assume president of the United States) and his girlfriend will become the most famous dancer in the world, or... they can stay together and ruin all the potential they COULD have had.  The choice is Matt's!To another one more element to the storyline, one of the men actually comes to Matt's aid to help him with these tough decisions.It sounds confusing but honestly the storyline is pretty simple to understand.  It's just a radically different concept that most of us haven't experienced in a movie before.  As a result, hey, I appreciate originality, so I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.Sure, the concept of being able to change the future by deviating from a specific plan may seem really bizarre and unbelievable, but the fact the Adjustment Bureau is so original won me over in a huge way!  Plus I loved the beautiful scenery of the door concept- whenever Matt Damon or one of the other men would go through a door, they would appear in a different environment.  In one example, they went to a baseball stadium after leaving a dark stairway.  It gets our imaginative juices flowing.  You'll see what I mean when you watch it.I love the Adjustment Bureau.  Basically the moral is that you have choices in your life, and free will, so you should take advantage of it.",4,interesting,1322870400,"12 3, 2011",2011,3750,"['Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'quite', 'surprise', 'romance/science', 'fiction', 'type', 'movie', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'was', 'remotely', 'possible', 'blend', 'two', 'drastically', 'different', 'styles', 'together', 'make', 'something', 'watchable', 'witnessing', 'now', 'see', 'how', 'Let', 'be', 'known', ""'m"", 'humongous', 'fan', 'movie', 'concepts', 'are', 'just', 'plain', '*different*', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anything', 'else', 'resembling', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'definitely', 'unique', 'Leading', 'viewers', 'thinking', 'going', 'be', 'yet', 'election/politician', 'type', 'plotline', 'then', 'morphing', 'pure', 'science', 'fiction', 'genius', '*incredibly*', 'surprising', 'move.Many', 'complaints', ""'ve"", 'read', 'are', 'plot', 'difficult', 'follow', 'actually', 'remarkably', 'SIMPLE', 'follow-', 'just', 'unbelievably', 'different', 'everything', 'else', 'there', 'hard', 'wrap', 'head', 'concept.It', 'mysterious', 'uniform-wearing', 'men', 'make', 'special', 'appearances', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'character', 'men', 'exist', 'make', 'sure', 'people', 'do', 'things', 'according', 'plan', 'word', 'plan', 'frequently', 'mentioned', 'theme', 'watching', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'word', 'thousand', 'times', 'believe', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'specific', 'name', 'first', 'presence', 'hard', 'understand', 'just', '*appear*', 'mysterious', 'conditions', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'think', 'film', 'going.Well', 'out', 'men', 'are', 'convinced', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'character', 'potential', 'make', 'significant', 'impact', 'future', 'concerning', 'role', 'politician', 'always', 'appear', 'firm', 'attempt', 'make', 'sure', 'right', 'course', 'distractions', 'however', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'love', 'course', 'just', '*look*', 'time', 'contact', 'woman', 'again', 'total', 'chance', 'bus', 'ride', 'walking', 'down', 'city', 'sidewalk', 'NOT', 'part', 'plan', 'Uh', 'oh', 'mysterious', 'men', 'are', 'going', 'cause', 'trouble', 'poor', 'Matt', 'according', 'storyline', 'anything', 'plan', 'will', 'result', 'Matt', 'memory', 'being', 'erased.Well', 'particular', 'aspect', 'fall', 'wayside', 'while', 'later', 'strange', 'men', 'demand', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'character', 'make', 'really', 'difficult', 'decision-', 'break', 'up', 'relationship', 'girl', 'so', 'Matt', 'can', 'eventually', 'become', 'powerful', 'leader', 'assume', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'girlfriend', 'will', 'become', 'most', 'famous', 'dancer', 'world', 'can', 'stay', 'together', 'ruin', 'potential', 'COULD', 'have', 'had', 'choice', 'Matt', 'one', 'more', 'element', 'storyline', 'one', 'men', 'actually', 'Matt', 'aid', 'help', 'tough', 'decisions.It', 'confusing', 'honestly', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'simple', 'understand', 'just', 'radically', 'different', 'concept', 'most', 'have', ""n't"", 'experienced', 'movie', 'before', 'result', 'hey', 'appreciate', 'originality', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie.Sure', 'concept', 'being', 'able', 'change', 'future', 'deviating', 'specific', 'plan', 'may', 'seem', 'really', 'bizarre', 'unbelievable', 'fact', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'so', 'original', 'won', 'over', 'huge', 'way', 'loved', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'door', 'concept-', 'whenever', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'one', 'other', 'men', 'would', 'go', 'door', 'would', 'appear', 'different', 'environment', 'one', 'example', 'went', 'baseball', 'stadium', 'leaving', 'dark', 'stairway', 'imaginative', 'juices', 'flowing', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'watch', 'it.I', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'Basically', 'moral', 'have', 'choices', 'life', 'free', 'will', 'should', 'take', 'advantage']",The Adjustment Bureau [DVD]

However the superficial story of lovers destined to be together and assisted by friends from another reality is quite enough to carry this movie.Looking closely at this film you'll notice that many of the people are not really actors there actually politicians and other famous people. However the filmmakers selected just the right actors to play the characters and the actors do not overwhelm the characters they are playing; so you to imagine yourself as part of the story and find yourself kibitzing.I missed this at the theater but did pick it up on Blu-ray and the particular DVD that I watched had a few interesting extras such as:Deleted and extended scenesThe labyrinth of doors: interactive map of New YorkLeaping through New YorkDestined to beBecoming a ElideFeature Commentary with/Director George NolfiAlso included extras or things like:My scenesD-boxI have to confess that only took advantage of the commentaries.

You are rooting for them to be together, and they are such great characters and good actors that the story and plot bumps don't interfere too much.

Based upon Phillip K. Dicks The Adjustment Team this adaptation was visually stunning, thrilling and thought provoking. Here we see existentialism brought to life in the myriad of choices we must make (or do we) every day. The lives of two people, the loves of two people hang in the balance and one must choose between different fates, Yes, a paradox. If it is fate how can one choose? This is the core, the essence of this film. Do we have free will? Can we choose? Does love conquer all? This film follows the life paths of David Norris and Elise Sellas. The chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt was palpable. I can honestly say I have not felt that kind of connection between two actors since, well, I really cannot remember. You will be rooting for these two all the way through the film. The cinematography was fantastic as we are a blur through Manhattan's various districts and beyond. While I give this film high honors I will say that it misses the mark in some areas. It truly could have pushed the envelope a little further and become something utterly fantastic, but it played it a little too safe and for that it only earned four stars, Where it sought to stimulate the intellect they held back and that disappointed because there was so much more in that capacity that could have been explored. Leave it to the viewer on that one I guess. If you are looking for a romance, you found it. If you are looking for action, you found it. If you are looking for some flash, you found it.

This movie was one that I would never have normally considered, but it is so moving a tale of true love, sacrifice, believing in free will and seeking your soul mate no matter the cost, that I was in tears at the end. I do believe in an afterlife and that there is only one true soul mate for each of us - we just have to find that person and then stay with them. I refuse to believe that death will separate us and if we find our soul mate then we must do everything to be with them. I'm originally from Scotland so not known for being a cry baby or soft person, but something about this movie hit me very hard and jarred a lot of emotional strings in my heart.  All I can say is watch it, then hug your soul mate if they are with you and hug/watch them every day that you can, and if you are not with your soul mate, but are trying to woo them, go for it and do everything that you can to snag them - and then make sure you keep them with you forever! Every second with a soul mate is worth a lifetime with anyone else............I found mine and this movie made me more determined than ever to find her again - Death shall not part us, Mary, nor keep us apart for more than a passing moment in the annuals of time . . so for this movie all i can say is - - - - Watch, enjoy .....and wonder!

I went in expecting more of a thought provoking movie about a mysterious group that knows everything about us and can change our world as they please. within the first thirty minutes we are told what they are in a pretty unexciting way and there is no mystery left to what they are doing throughout the rest of the film. Also I thought the way the bureau was explained was too feel-good yet vague. So the rest of the movie centers around a love story, which never really feels like the actors believe they're destined to be together, however, we are constantly told they are. Towards the end when the two lovers are breaking all the rules to be together it just starts to feel too sappy and fairytale-like, and I mean that there is no rational thought to their decisions, instead it just seems everything works out for the best and they live happily ever after.This movie could have been written a little better, especially to round out the adjustment bureau and make them more interesting.

1345092,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B003GAMOIW,C. Sawin,"[10, 12]","Considering all the garbage movie critics have to sit through in a year, it's pretty amazing when a film that's smarter than most hits theaters and makes a bit of an impact. Independent films are one thing, but major ones released by bigger studios are even a bigger deal when this occurs. I think that's one of the reasons Inception was so great. Creativity and intelligence are two things that are usually lacking from blockbusters. The Adjustment Bureau is a film that has a bit more to it than you're probably expecting. Based on ""The Adjustment Group,"" a short story by Philip K. Dick (Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report), The Adjustment Bureau has probably already caught your attention either because you're a fan of Dick's work and/or the movies that were adapted from it.The film's charm is definitely in its explanation for things. The way the bureau works and how they function is a wonder in itself. You'll never look at a door or a man wearing a hat the same way again after viewing the film. Perhaps the most interesting is Thompson's explanation of how events in history like The Great Depression and The Holocaust came about. The story is very imaginative and different from the norm, which is always a fantastic change in pace when it comes to film. At the same time though, those who like having absolutely everything explained to them will probably be disappointed. The Adjustment Bureau explains enough to get the wheels in your brain turning and leaves some things open to your interpretation, which could hurt someone's overall opinon of the film depending on the viewer.I've never been the biggest Matt Damon fan. My favorite memory involving him was the Team America parody that he wasn't even involved with, but I think of that ""Matt Damon!"" line every time I see him on screen. However, he did have strong showings in both Hereafter and True Grit from last year. He keeps the trend going here. David seems to be a guy who was once fueled by speaking in front of hundreds of people and politics, but has now replaced that void with Elyse. The chemistry he has with Elyse, despite feeling somewhat brief, is one of the driving factors of the film. Anthony Mackie winds up being the most memorable bureau agent mostly because he has an emotional tie to David, but John Slattery and Terence Stamp have some pretty noteworthy performances as well.I have the impression that a lot of people will write this off as a Men In Black ripoff, but The Adjustment Bureau is a bit more clever than either Men In Black film. The films surely have their similarities, but The Adjustment Bureau deserves to be given a chance. I think it'll surprise a lot of viewers.The Adjustment Bureau is easily the smartest live-action film to be released in the first few months of 2011. With a solid cast, a hefty helping of creativity, and just an absorbing experiencing overall, The Adjustment Bureau is bound to leave a lasting impression when it comes time to look back on the best films of the year. The film leaves you questioning how much of your life is really left to fate and chance. Films seem to leave an impression that lasts longer if it makes you think or strikes a cord or hits close to home in some capacity. This film does that and then some. It comes highly recommended even if you have your reservations about it.",4,An all around amazing film,1299110400,"03 3, 2011",2011,3339,"['Considering', 'garbage', 'movie', 'critics', 'have', 'sit', 'year', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'when', 'film', 'smarter', 'most', 'hits', 'theaters', 'bit', 'impact', 'Independent', 'films', 'are', 'one', 'thing', 'major', 'ones', 'released', 'bigger', 'studios', 'are', 'even', 'bigger', 'deal', 'when', 'think', 'one', 'reasons', 'Inception', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'Creativity', 'intelligence', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'are', 'usually', 'lacking', 'blockbusters', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'film', 'bit', 'more', ""'re"", 'probably', 'expecting', 'Based', 'Adjustment', 'Group', 'short', 'story', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Minority', 'Report', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'probably', 'already', 'caught', 'attention', 'either', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Dick', 'work', 'and/or', 'movies', 'were', 'adapted', 'it.The', 'film', 'charm', 'definitely', 'explanation', 'things', 'way', 'bureau', 'how', 'function', 'wonder', ""'ll"", 'never', 'look', 'door', 'man', 'wearing', 'hat', 'same', 'way', 'again', 'viewing', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'Thompson', 'explanation', 'how', 'events', 'history', 'Great', 'Depression', 'Holocaust', 'came', 'about', 'story', 'very', 'imaginative', 'different', 'norm', 'always', 'fantastic', 'change', 'pace', 'when', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'who', 'like', 'having', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'explained', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'enough', 'get', 'wheels', 'brain', 'turning', 'things', 'open', 'interpretation', 'could', 'hurt', 'someone', 'overall', 'opinon', 'film', 'depending', 'viewer.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'biggest', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'fan', 'favorite', 'memory', 'involving', 'was', 'Team', 'America', 'parody', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'involved', 'think', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'line', 'time', 'see', 'screen', 'However', 'did', 'have', 'strong', 'showings', 'Hereafter', 'True', 'Grit', 'last', 'year', 'trend', 'going', 'here', 'David', 'be', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'fueled', 'speaking', 'front', 'hundreds', 'people', 'politics', 'now', 'replaced', 'void', 'Elyse', 'chemistry', 'Elyse', 'feeling', 'somewhat', 'brief', 'one', 'driving', 'factors', 'film', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'up', 'being', 'most', 'memorable', 'bureau', 'agent', 'mostly', 'emotional', 'tie', 'David', 'John', 'Slattery', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'have', 'pretty', 'noteworthy', 'performances', 'well.I', 'have', 'impression', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'write', 'off', 'Men', 'Black', 'ripoff', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'bit', 'more', 'clever', 'Men', 'Black', 'film', 'films', 'surely', 'have', 'similarities', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'be', 'given', 'chance', 'think', ""'ll"", 'surprise', 'lot', 'viewers.The', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'easily', 'smartest', 'live-action', 'film', 'be', 'released', 'first', 'few', 'months', '2011', 'solid', 'cast', 'hefty', 'helping', 'creativity', 'just', 'absorbing', 'experiencing', 'overall', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'bound', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'when', 'time', 'look', 'back', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'film', 'questioning', 'how', 'much', 'life', 'really', 'left', 'fate', 'chance', 'Films', 'seem', 'leave', 'impression', 'longer', 'think', 'strikes', 'cord', 'hits', 'close', 'home', 'capacity', 'film', 'then', 'highly', 'recommended', 'even', 'have', 'reservations']",The Adjustment Bureau [DVD]

1345095,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B003GAMOIW,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[8, 13]","""The Adjustment Bureau"" addresses favorite, and much-contested, themes: the role of fate, or chance, or free will in our lives. Theologians, scientists, theists and atheists have puzzled over these questions for thousands of years. The film posits an official bureaucracy that massages everyday human activities - whether or not rising young political star David Norris (Matt Damon) spills coffee on his shirt during his morning commute through a park, whether Elise Sallas (Emily Blunt), a dancer, falls and sprains her ankle onstage - in order to achieve the outcomes the Adjustment Bureau desires. It's a fantastic premise, which the film thoroughly wastes.David Norris is a rising political star; Elise Sallas is a rising dancer. They meet and fall in love at first sight. Their love defies the desired ends of the Adjustment Bureau. The Adjustment Bureau may be carrying out the will of God, and its caseworkers may be angels. The film never makes it clear. Hats give the Adjustment Bureau's caseworkers their power. Yes, hats, exactly the kind of snap-brim hat that Frank Sinatra made famous in the 1950s. (Thus the title of the tribute book, ""The Way You Wear Your Hat."") Too, Adjustment Bureau case workers refer to their boss, who may be God, as ""The Chairman."" They don't mean Mao - this must be a reference to Sinatra, nicknamed ""Chairman of the Board."" I'm sorry, but this film was so boring, it sent my mind down these trails.When the Adjustment Bureau made its presence known, and revealed its near omnipotence over David Norris' fate, I didn't care. I felt no anxiety for David or Elise. The film evoked no sense of mystery, not even the shiver you get when you think of a friend and that friend immediately phones you. I kept thinking of other films that introduced supernatural, fate-altering others into average mortal's lives. Cary Grant as the angel Dudley in ""The Bishop's Wife"" caused more of a sense of wonder and awe. In ""Portrait of Jenny,"" another movie about a fated relationship, there's a scene of ice-skaters in Central Park. The scene is very wholesome and suitable for family viewing. It's shot in black and white. Even so, with no special effects, it creates a powerful sense of the weird that ""Adjustment Bureau"" never matches.Matt Damon plays, as he always does, Matt Damon: an oversmart, internal guy who keeps his cards close to his chest and doesn't so much relate to others as manipulate them to his own purposes. He was brilliant at this in ""Good Will Hunting"" and he's been good at it ever since.Emily Blunt is not his best partner. She's a great dominatrix, as she was in ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" or ""Young Victoria."" Her crispness never penetrates Damon's emotional armor, as did Minnie Driver in ""Hunting"" with her over-the-top emotionality.I never felt that David and Elise were experiencing the kind of love worthy of the risks they take in the movie, and I really did not care whether they were together at the end or not.Because the movie didn't grab me, I noticed all the plot holes I would not have seen had I been swept up in movie magic. The Adjustment Bureau teams are thrown off their game by rain. But they're shown to be almost omnipotent. Why rain? Throw me a bone, here! Hats make them powerful? HATS? There are simply too many Adjustment Bureau personnel. They're like a bumbling team of Keystone Cops, chasing about, and accomplishing very little. They don't intimidate or impress us. They don't make us go, ""Wow!""Any discussion of fate, chance, free will and God invokes huge questions. Why does God allow the innocent to suffer, for example? Do we really control our own fates, or are we merely puppets in the hands of the Gods? The movie attempts to address this in a monologue by Terence Stamp. He says that the height of civilization was the Roman Empire. Yes, that same Roman Empire that crucified six thousand slaves along the Appian Way, and entertained its masses with scenes of wild animals feasting on human flesh. Stamp then denigrates the so-called ""Dark Ages,"" a misnomer intended to make the Christian Europe that arose after the fall of the Roman Empire look bad. Oh, how silly.In order to establish that David Norris is a man on the move, the film uses fake news clips of real personalities, including Jon Stewart and other television news commentators. The careful and extensive inclusion of these real personalities betrays the film's failure. Who cares if Jon Stewart is in a movie about love, fate, God, chance? Don't give me Jon Stewart and Mary Matalin; I can see them on TV. Make a work of art that makes me think something I've never thought before.",2,It's Sinatra's World - If We Only Knew to What Extent!,1299369600,"03 6, 2011",2011,4634,"['Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'favorite', 'much-contested', 'themes', 'role', 'fate', 'chance', 'free', 'will', 'lives', 'Theologians', 'scientists', 'theists', 'atheists', 'have', 'puzzled', 'questions', 'thousands', 'years', 'film', 'official', 'bureaucracy', 'everyday', 'human', 'activities', 'not', 'rising', 'young', 'political', 'star', 'David', 'Norris', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'coffee', 'shirt', 'morning', 'commute', 'park', 'Elise', 'Sallas', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'dancer', 'falls', 'ankle', 'onstage', 'order', 'achieve', 'outcomes', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'fantastic', 'premise', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'wastes.David', 'Norris', 'rising', 'political', 'star', 'Elise', 'Sallas', 'rising', 'dancer', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'love', 'desired', 'ends', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'may', 'be', 'carrying', 'will', 'God', 'caseworkers', 'may', 'be', 'angels', 'film', 'never', 'clear', 'Hats', 'give', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'caseworkers', 'power', 'Yes', 'hats', 'exactly', 'kind', 'snap-brim', 'hat', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'made', 'famous', '1950s', 'title', 'tribute', 'book', 'Way', 'Wear', 'Hat', 'Too', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'case', 'workers', 'refer', 'boss', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'God', 'Chairman', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Mao', 'must', 'be', 'reference', 'Sinatra', 'nicknamed', 'Chairman', 'Board', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'boring', 'sent', 'mind', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'made', 'presence', 'known', 'revealed', 'near', 'omnipotence', 'David', 'Norris', 'fate', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'felt', 'anxiety', 'David', 'Elise', 'film', 'evoked', 'sense', 'mystery', 'not', 'even', 'shiver', 'get', 'when', 'think', 'friend', 'friend', 'immediately', 'phones', 'kept', 'thinking', 'other', 'films', 'introduced', 'supernatural', 'fate-altering', 'others', 'average', 'mortal', 'lives', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'angel', 'Dudley', 'Bishop', 'Wife', 'caused', 'more', 'sense', 'wonder', 'awe', 'Portrait', 'Jenny', 'movie', 'fated', 'relationship', 'scene', 'ice-skaters', 'Central', 'Park', 'scene', 'very', 'wholesome', 'suitable', 'family', 'viewing', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'Even', 'so', 'special', 'effects', 'powerful', 'sense', 'weird', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'never', 'matches.Matt', 'Damon', 'plays', 'always', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'oversmart', 'internal', 'guy', 'who', 'cards', 'close', 'chest', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'relate', 'others', 'manipulate', 'own', 'purposes', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'been', 'good', 'ever', 'since.Emily', 'Blunt', 'not', 'best', 'partner', 'great', 'dominatrix', 'was', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'Young', 'Victoria', 'crispness', 'never', 'Damon', 'emotional', 'armor', 'did', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'Hunting', 'over-the-top', 'emotionality.I', 'never', 'felt', 'David', 'Elise', 'were', 'experiencing', 'kind', 'love', 'worthy', 'risks', 'take', 'movie', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'were', 'together', 'end', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'grab', 'noticed', 'plot', 'holes', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'had', 'been', 'swept', 'up', 'movie', 'magic', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'teams', 'are', 'thrown', 'off', 'game', 'rain', ""'re"", 'shown', 'be', 'almost', 'omnipotent', 'Why', 'rain', 'Throw', 'bone', 'here', 'Hats', 'make', 'powerful', 'HATS', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'personnel', ""'re"", 'bumbling', 'team', 'Keystone', 'Cops', 'chasing', 'accomplishing', 'very', 'little', 'do', ""n't"", 'intimidate', 'impress', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'go', 'Wow', 'discussion', 'fate', 'chance', 'free', 'will', 'God', 'huge', 'questions', 'Why', 'God', 'allow', 'innocent', 'suffer', 'example', 'Do', 'really', 'control', 'own', 'fates', 'are', 'merely', 'hands', 'Gods', 'movie', 'address', 'monologue', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'height', 'civilization', 'was', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'Yes', 'same', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'crucified', 'six', 'thousand', 'slaves', 'Appian', 'Way', 'entertained', 'masses', 'scenes', 'wild', 'animals', 'feasting', 'human', 'flesh', 'Stamp', 'then', 'so-called', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'misnomer', 'intended', 'make', 'Christian', 'Europe', 'arose', 'fall', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'look', 'bad', 'Oh', 'how', 'silly.In', 'order', 'establish', 'David', 'Norris', 'man', 'move', 'film', 'fake', 'news', 'clips', 'real', 'personalities', 'including', 'Jon', 'Stewart', 'other', 'television', 'news', 'commentators', 'careful', 'extensive', 'inclusion', 'real', 'personalities', 'film', 'failure', 'Who', 'Jon', 'Stewart', 'movie', 'love', 'fate', 'God', 'chance', 'Do', ""n't"", 'give', 'Jon', 'Stewart', 'Mary', 'Matalin', 'can', 'see', 'TV', 'Make', 'work', 'art', 'think', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'thought', 'before']",The Adjustment Bureau [DVD]

Both leads do effective jobs in their roles with Matt Damon as a strong action lead and the Emily Blunt character as a lovely and vulnerable ballerina.As others have pointed out, the move is taken from a short story by Philip K. Dick whose writing career was unfortunately cut short by his untimely death. Dick was noted for his creative approach to storytelling and this story is one of those. It just happens to tread on some thin ice when it challenges the notion of free will, a sacred cow for those who are determined to believe they are the captains of their own fate; it becomes rather polarizing in that regard.It is probably a worthy addition for the collector but should be approached carefully by those who are not.",4,An Action Sci-Fi Movie with an Interesting Twist,1329696000,"02 20, 2012",2012,1076,"['like', 'sci-fi', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'movie', 'interesting', 'probably', 'more', 'fantasy', 'sci-fi', 'Efforts', 'are', 'made', 'movie', 'provide', 'realism', 'using', 'nationally', 'know', 'people', 'bit', 'parts', 'add', 'aura', 'authenticity', 'overall', 'impression', 'one', 'decent', 'action', 'movie', 'fairly', 'brisk', 'pace', 'way', 'leads', 'do', 'effective', 'jobs', 'roles', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'strong', 'action', 'lead', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'character', 'lovely', 'vulnerable', 'ballerina.As', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'move', 'taken', 'short', 'story', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'writing', 'career', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'cut', 'short', 'untimely', 'death', 'Dick', 'was', 'noted', 'creative', 'approach', 'storytelling', 'story', 'one', 'just', 'tread', 'thin', 'ice', 'when', 'notion', 'free', 'will', 'sacred', 'cow', 'who', 'are', 'determined', 'believe', 'are', 'captains', 'own', 'fate', 'rather', 'polarizing', 'regard.It', 'probably', 'worthy', 'addition', 'collector', 'should', 'be', 'approached', 'carefully', 'who', 'are', 'not']",The Adjustment Bureau [DVD]

Dick stories (A Scanner Darkly,Next,Paycheck) have always been translated into film really well - some better than others (Blade Runner,Minority Report). While not my favorite adaptation, this film was a great thriller and enjoyable watch.The story is about David Norris (Matt Damon) , a young and popular congressman, who one day meets a beautiful and mysterious woman (Emily Blunt) and falls head-over-heels for her, only to discover that there are strange circumstances that arise to keep them apart.Matt Damon and Emily Blunt's on-screen chemistry is awesome. Both played their characters really well and both seemed to play off of each other even better. If nothing else draws you into this movie, the relationship between these two will. Matt Damon is just an awesome actor. Period.As with most other Philip Dick stories, the plotline is very mind-bending and supernatural. The story progresses extremely well and leads up to a satisfying climax. Many people were disengaged by the conclusion of the film, and while I thought that it could have been solved better, I was still contented with how it ended and enjoyed the ride getting there. The content could have been delved into a little further and I would have liked to know more about what happened to some of the other characters in the film, but there was nothing that put me off in this film.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 1]","Matt Damon is a terrific actor and he's starred in a wide range of exceptional movies.THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU ain't one of them.This eclectic hodge-podge of a mess never finds its footing or its message; Damon plays an up and coming Congressman with limitless potential, yet when he falls in love by a chance encounter with a dancer (Emily Blunt) he suddenly finds mysterious obstacles thrown onto his path to keep him from seeing her again.  And these aren't run-of-the-mill obstacles, by golly, these are the shenanigans of the Adjustment Bureau, metaphysical G-Men who pop out of doors (wormholes) throughout Brooklyn and Manhattan to create nonsensical mischief.  Why?  Because, of course, the young Congressman will not stay true to 'The Plan' (and the Bureau, with its 'administrator', has high aspirations for the young pol, of course) if he spends his life with the girl of his dreams.  So Damon's character, once the Bureau lets him in on their secret (at the risk of being deprogrammed, mind you), must decide whether to follow said Plan or risk it all with the girl.  What ensues is, more or less, one chase scene after another, ad nauseum.As we get deeper into the film, it's readily apparent even the Bureau members (all sporting hats, which allows them to pass in and out of the wormholes) aren't sure of their powers; accordingly THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is confusing, convoluted, uneven, rambling, nonsensical, banal, and trite.  And those are its good points.  Even the extremely talented Terence Stamp makes an appearance as one of the Bureau's top hombres; naturally he lectures Damon's character as to why humans are no longer allowed free will:  because, when the Bureau has allowed free will, mankind gave itself the Dark Ages, world wars, near nuclear extinction, yada yada yada.  It was so superficial and hokey I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry.  So I did both.  Neither facilitated any relief from THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU.

This, of course, kills this film's potential as a think-piece that many might want but makes it accessible to a more casual audience. Somehow, it all works splendidly, mostly because of the fine acting by all and the solid human interest story of Norris's love for ballerina Elise Sella, memorably played by Emily Blunt, a relationship that goes against the plans of the mysterious ""Chairman"" who makes all the rules and plans our lives for us.This film is the most realistic sort of fantasy. . .or is it really fantasy?. . . that one can imagine.

1345115,A1TJIJKKN15KR9,B003GAMOIW,drqshadow,"[0, 0]","An excellent Philip K. Dick adaptation that comes off as neither too cerebral nor too wantonly action-heavy. Matt Damon slides into the role of a brash, combustible young politician in the mold of JFK, whose chance meeting with his dream girl sets off a chain reaction that alters his perception of the world at large. Shortly afterwards he stumbles across the delegates of a shadow agency, who freeze time and bend reality to tinker with the thoughts and feelings of the population, all in the name of a precise global timeline. Damon, naturally, is immune to their tricks and bolts from the scene. As a science fiction twist on the cat and mouse game, it's a blast of fresh air with an admirable sense of restraint. In a perfect world these agents would do their jobs without being noticed at all, so their methods consist of a series of slick, downplayed visual tricks and slight tweaks to the natural order. That sensibility works for their own purposes, but also for the film's: the special effects are equally moderate, and as a result more believable. Damon and Emily Blunt click right away as a duo, so well in fact that it's no challenge at all to root for them from the get-go, and the agency itself is far from the black-and-white, good-versus-evil gang of naughty henchmen you might expect.

1345119,A4796VPATRFR1,B003GAMOIW,Eoghann Irving,"[0, 0]","Let's be clear up front. This is a Hollywood movie with elements of thriller/action and probably primarily romance at play. Yes it is very loosely based on the Philip K. Dick story _The Adjustment Team_ but it would probably be more accurate to say inspired by.But, it does gently poke at some larger questions on the subject of free will. And the importance of self vs. the importance of society. Though I'm not surprised which side it inevitably comes down on.Matt Damon plays an up and coming politician who suffers a crushing defeat in an election. The adjustment bureau working to the plan drawn up by The Chairman set up a meeting with Emily Blunt a rather more freewheeling character.Sparks fly and Damon's character is inspired to give a concession speech that essentially lines him up for future political success. They are never supposed to meet again. But they do.And from there things spiral as the bureau takes ever stronger measures to keep these two people apart and Damon makes ever more frantic efforts to find the person he feels is the love of his life.It's a well shot movie that switches between tension and calm fluidly. It helps that Damon and Blunt have a great on screen chemistry with each other and you can easily see these characters wanting to be together.It has what you might call surface depth. Asking questions about whether humans can be trusted with free will. But not exploring them too deeply.And I'm okay with that. Because it's a fun movie to watch and one that went deep into those issues would not be.There are avenues I wish it had pursued a little further though. They ending is a classic Deus Ex Machina although perhaps more applicable than in many cases. And they carefully avoid addressing the ""What happens next?"" question. Which is the really difficult one.Easier to stick with the love storySo no this isn't a great movie.

1345135,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003GAMOIW,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","Philip K. Dick ((December 16, 1928 - March 2, 1982) grows more popular as a writer in contemporary culture than he was during his lifetime. He typically focused on the fragile nature of what is ""real"" and the construction of personal identity. His stories often become surreal fantasies as the main characters slowly discover that their everyday world is actually an illusion constructed by powerful external entities, vast political conspiracies, or simply from the vicissitudes of an unreliable narrator. All of his work starts with the basic assumption that there cannot be one, single, objective reality. Everything is a matter of perception. The ground is liable to shift under your feet. A protagonist may find himself living out another person's dream, or he may enter a drug-induced state that actually makes better sense than the real world, or he may cross into a different universe completely.'  Given this background information about the origin of the idea of THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU, the story adapted  for the screen from Dick's 'Adjustment Team' by writer/director George Nolfi (The Bourne series, Ocean's Twelve, etc), offers a new appreciation for this well-timed suspense thriller love story - 'Love' being the operative word.David Norris (Matt Damon) is running for New York Senator guided by the counsel of his friend and campaign manager Charlie (Michael Kelly) and they seem to be on a wining track.  David meets the very beautiful dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) in the strangest of circumstances and their attraction, peppered with very fine comic repartee, is immediately apparently. Past faux pas of David's appear in the media and his chances of winning the election seem to be diminishing.  At this point David meets some hatted gentlemen -  Richardson (John Slattery) and Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie) - who represent the adjustment bureau, a group of men who follow the life plan set by the Chairman to keep people in line with their intended destinies.  David is instructed to never see Elise again as she is not part of his planned life (a career that despite setbacks is supposed to eventually lead to the Presidency of the US). From this point on it becomes a challenge for David to either obey the adjustment team or follow his heart and be with Emily. After a separation of three years David sees Elise again and the fire of love burns even more brightly.  David is warned that if he follows his heart (his free will) he not only will not become the man of his career dreams but that he will also destroy Elise's assigned future of becoming the world's most honored dancer/choreographer.  Which drives succeed and how they happen is a wild chase by David and Elise to run toward their own free will through mazes and secret passages and strange situations a s devised by Richardson, aided by Harry, and controlled by Richardson's replacement, Thompson (Terrance Stamp).  It is a struggle between destiny and free will.There is a fine line in Philip K. Dick's story ideas that teeters between the credible and the pure sci-fi direction.  In this film the midline is found and the reason the strange story succeeds so well is due in great part to the extraordinary on-screen chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, two actors who continue to grow in stature, having that ability to pull off sophisticated comedy with action packed suspense.  The entire cast is  excellent and seems to be responsive to the well-conceived direction of George Nolfi.  THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is first and foremost a love story, and a very fine one at that.

That translates to giving what is essentially God, and the Angels, new corporate working titles, like The Chairman, and The Adjustment Bureau.  And they wear retro-cool clothes out of ""Men In Black"", no robes and sandals.  No wings, either, but they've got doors.So God, I mean the Chairman, has a plan.  The Plan.  But the Plan changes every now and then, no one knows why, and apparently Damon and Blunt were to have met and fallen in love, but now the Plan has changed and that isn't in the works.  One of Angels, I mean the Adjusters, is still on Suburban time though, and doesn't get his butt where it's supposed to be, so when Damon spills his coffee, it's on Blunt, not in Washington Square.Now it turns out, when this sort of thing happens, the Angels, I mean Adjusters, come in and basically clean it up by wiping out everyone's memory, no harm done.  Except when someone like Damon's character comes along, and sees too much, and then they simply confess and warn him about what will happen if he doesn't get with the program.Of course, Damon's character does not get with the program, and it turns out that if you can reach God, I mean the Chairman...Terry Gilliam and much of Monty Python did a low-brow (and low budget) version of this back in the eighties with ""Time Bandits"" where a marauding group of also-not-called-angels, with God's Plan, drop through its holes and loot history, from Napoleon to the sinking Titanic, with, as it turns out, God following them to fix the holes.  Hired hackers as we'd call them today.Both are entertaining films, I think I'd prefer ""Time Bandits"" as it doesn't go to quite the pretense of not being able to say what it's characters are, but then again, look at how many folks saw this film as SciFi.

1345141,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003GAMOIW,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","In the bleakest moment of upstart New York senator David Norris's political career, he meets free-spirited dancer Elise Sellas and never mind that he meets her in the men's room as he goes over his concession speech. Their flirty chance encounter so inspires David that his concession speech goes on to electrify the crowd and firmly plants him as a frontrunner for the next election. Mysterious are the workings of fate, that unknowable shaper of things that has decreed that this would be David and Elise's sole encounter. But then fate takes an inadvertent nap.Taking the bus one day, David bumps into Elise again, and this time he's not willing to let go. And this is where fate manifests in the shape of the Adjustment Bureau, comprised of ordinary-looking men clad in trenchcoats and fedoras but demonstrating the uncanny knack for freezing time and folding geography. These strange Adjusters align themselves against David Norris, conspire against his pursuit of Elise. And there's just something quite cool and very Greek mythology about a guy who is so undeterred and would fight fate itself to be with the one he loves. But you can't discount how chilling the Adjustment Bureau's top agent Thompson (Terence Stamp) sounds when he tells our smitten, defiant congressman: ""When you look back at all this, David, just remember - we tried to reason with you.""In a way, it's comforting to know that there IS a plan. Now I don't have to fret about free will and all that jazz and worry that I chose the wrong pair of socks to wear on a given day. Those socks were simply destined to be worn! It's cute how the story tries to be subtle with its referencing of the Almighty Dude and his assortment of guardian angels, preferring to instead trot out its ""agents of fate"" who - in the midst of ensuring that ""the Plan"" stays on course - would occasionally speak in awed tones of someone called ""the Chairman."" Thankfully, in terms of sensibility, the narrative stays more within the borders of the sci-fi thriller, instead of straying too far into the divine.Maybe Matt Damon signed onboard this film partly because his pal Ben Affleck had already done a film adaptation of a Philip K. Dick short story (""Paycheck""). ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is based on Philip K. Dick's 1954 short story ""Adjustment Team."" But whatever the motivation, Damon excels in his role of David Norris, does well with the romantic lead bits and, of course, the action hero bits. His very real chemistry with Emily Blunt (who is simply perfect here) sells their characters' immediate attraction to each other. More than anything else, the romance is the driving force of the story. You get invested in what happens to David and Elise, and you pull for David to find a way to stump the Adjustment Bureau, to avoid their recalibration or resetting or whatever it is that they do to you when you get too uppity and challenge fate.Themes such as predestination and free will are raised, and David Norris must wrestle with two choices, one which will benefit the greater good and the other which preserves his personal happiness. There's even this added dramatic tension in that the Adjustment Bureau is working for the betterment of mankind. As Thompson informs our hero: ""David, you can change the world. But that doesn't happen if you stay with her."" Although, conversely, there's a line of thought which sees the Bureau as these mindless, unquestioning drones. But it's not all angsty navel-gazing. There are some snappy chase scenes, bolstered by some slick special effects. You have to like the seamless visual transitions as the Adjusters navigate supernaturally thru the city by way of these doors that - once activated by the agents' hats - open to other places. And you have to really like it when David gets a hold of one of these hats.No deep sense of spirituality here or profound reflections on theology, and that's fine. The film was promoted as a romantic sci-fi thriller and I liked that it stuck to its guns. I like that the story earns its emotional moments. David's search for Elise spans years. Three years alone elapse with David every day taking the same bus going down the same route on the slim chance that Elise will one day get onboard (she doesn't). Emily Blunt is so appealing and so sexy that I sort of drowned in her performance. And you couldn't tell at all that she actually isn't a professional dancer; she's so good. You can see why she inspires David to fight for her in epic fashion. To hell with causality. Damn the ripples.The DVD's bonus material: Audio Commentary by writer/director George Nolfi; 6 Deleted/Extended Scenes (totaling 00:07:01 minutes long); ""Leaping Through New York"" - about shooting

In this amalgamation, Matt Damon plays politician David Norris who has just suffered a crushing defeat as a result of his impetuousness.  While planning his concession speech in a bathroom, he has a star-crossed meeting with a ballerina named Elise (Emily Blunt).  The resulting affair uncovers what is presumed to be the Adjustment Bureau, a team of caretaker angels who control the timeline of humanity's decisions so what is supposed to occur actually takes place.Damon and Blunt make a good protagonist couple.  The connection between leads is fairly convincing.  It's easy to perceive they were divined for one another.  Which is an accomplishment considering the lukewarm vibe exuded the last time he was supposed to be romantically linked to a brunette with a British accent.  Supporting actors like the always magnificent Terrance Stamp - who was interestingly enough in the movie Wanted, which shares many similarities with this film - fill out the gray more than adequately.  A few pseudo-celebrities and politicians show up as themselves.  They could have been left out.The major failings of this film revolve around the brief explanation of the caretakers, their abilities and responsibilities, and why David and Elise are doomed to failure with one another.  Especially since the plan is apparently changeable.  Not to mention why one of the caretakers would ever help David be with Elise.  Way too many missing plot pieces.Action is minimal, but there is a classic running sequence that would make Tom Cruise jealous.  In fact, intensity is lacking as well; the second act just takes way too long to get to the meat of the story.Decent Matt Damon vehicle about overcoming odds, changing destiny, and finding true love, but it's probably not a must see.",3,Free will is an illusion,1331942400,"03 17, 2012",2012,1878,"['Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'partThe', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'littleThe', 'Matrix', 'one', 'major', 'scene', 'fromMen', 'Black', 'amalgamation', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'politician', 'David', 'Norris', 'who', 'just', 'suffered', 'crushing', 'defeat', 'result', 'impetuousness', 'planning', 'concession', 'speech', 'bathroom', 'star-crossed', 'meeting', 'ballerina', 'named', 'Elise', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'resulting', 'affair', 'uncovers', 'what', 'presumed', 'be', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'team', 'caretaker', 'angels', 'who', 'control', 'timeline', 'humanity', 'decisions', 'what', 'supposed', 'occur', 'actually', 'place.Damon', 'Blunt', 'make', 'good', 'protagonist', 'couple', 'connection', 'leads', 'fairly', 'convincing', 'easy', 'perceive', 'were', 'divined', 'one', 'Which', 'accomplishment', 'considering', 'lukewarm', 'vibe', 'exuded', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'romantically', 'linked', 'brunette', 'British', 'accent', 'Supporting', 'actors', 'always', 'magnificent', 'Terrance', 'Stamp', 'who', 'was', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'movie', 'Wanted', 'shares', 'many', 'similarities', 'film', 'fill', 'gray', 'more', 'adequately', 'few', 'pseudo-celebrities', 'politicians', 'show', 'up', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out.The', 'major', 'failings', 'film', 'revolve', 'brief', 'explanation', 'caretakers', 'abilities', 'responsibilities', 'why', 'David', 'Elise', 'are', 'doomed', 'failure', 'one', 'Especially', 'plan', 'apparently', 'changeable', 'Not', 'mention', 'why', 'one', 'caretakers', 'would', 'ever', 'help', 'David', 'be', 'Elise', 'Way', 'too', 'many', 'missing', 'plot', 'pieces.Action', 'minimal', 'classic', 'running', 'sequence', 'would', 'make', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'jealous', 'fact', 'intensity', 'lacking', 'as', 'well', 'second', 'act', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'meat', 'story.Decent', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'vehicle', 'overcoming', 'odds', 'changing', 'destiny', 'finding', 'true', 'love', 'probably', 'not', 'must', 'see']",The Adjustment Bureau [DVD]

The members of the Adjustment Bureau are a blatant rip-off Matrix agents.  They even go so far as to borrow that same stilted speech of the Matrix agents in spots.  Unfortunately, unlike Matrix agents, the Adjusters aren't terribly menacing--or intriguing.  They're more like Disney agents, or something.The movie also feels like the City of Angels at times as it toys with the idea of freewill, divinity and love conquering all.  However, it never really gains full emotional intensity because the hero's path proves so predictable.  The trailers for the movie practically give you the trajectory of the film before you've begun.In some respects, I suppose you could accuse Adjustment Bureau of being chick-flick disguised as sci-fi.  Yet somehow the film manages to rise above its flaws and proves entertaining.  I suspect hardcore sci-fi fans will loathe this film.

The performances by Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Anthony Mackie are first-rate and it was good to see Terence Stamp in an important role. The story is pretty well summarized in the comments above the reviews and it would be hard to say more without giving the plot away.I suspect that this will be a movie that people either like or dislike, with little middle ground. The premise is either intriguing or too bizarre to be taken seriously, depending on each viewer's philosophical convictions. However, the tale is well realized and moves along at a good pace and not the least of its charms is the tour of New York that it gives us.I only rate it three stars for a couple of reasons. First, the original story by Philip K. Dick was only a novelette and it is somewhat short of twists and turns. Once we have grasped what is going on, which is about a third of the way into the movie, nothing much changes and it becomes a tad predictable. Although this isn't a long movie (it runs 99 minutes) the material is a little thin to keep the audience wondering what will happen next. The other issue is that the ending, although neatly resolved, is a little too pat. There is nothing left for the viewers to decide on for themselves.I certainly feel this is a good way to spend a couple of hours. You may find that there isn't much to it beyond that.",3,Well-adjusted movie,1299196800,"03 4, 2011",2011,1442,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'straight', 'off', 'genre', 'style', 'like', 'performances', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'are', 'first-rate', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'important', 'role', 'story', 'pretty', 'well', 'summarized', 'comments', 'reviews', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'say', 'more', 'giving', 'plot', 'away.I', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'movie', 'people', 'either', 'dislike', 'little', 'middle', 'ground', 'premise', 'intriguing', 'too', 'bizarre', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'depending', 'viewer', 'philosophical', 'convictions', 'However', 'tale', 'well', 'realized', 'moves', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'not', 'least', 'charms', 'tour', 'New', 'York', 'us.I', 'only', 'rate', 'three', 'stars', 'couple', 'reasons', 'First', 'original', 'story', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'was', 'only', 'novelette', 'somewhat', 'short', 'twists', 'turns', 'have', 'grasped', 'what', 'going', 'third', 'way', 'movie', 'nothing', 'much', 'changes', 'tad', 'predictable', ""n't"", 'long', 'movie', '99', 'minutes', 'material', 'little', 'thin', 'keep', 'audience', 'wondering', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'other', 'issue', 'ending', 'neatly', 'resolved', 'little', 'too', 'pat', 'nothing', 'left', 'viewers', 'decide', 'themselves.I', 'certainly', 'feel', 'good', 'way', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours', 'may', 'find', ""n't"", 'much']",The Adjustment Bureau [DVD]

1345165,A1VF0102Z9VITO,B003GAMOIW,Joseph M. Reninger,"[0, 0]","Being a science fiction fan, I was intrigued by the premise of The Adjustment Bureau. The basic idea, that a shadow group is manipulating people according to their own plan or design, is not new in the sci fi genre (The Matrix, Inception, and Dark City are the first to mind). Or in political thrillers like The Manchurian Candidate. In this story, Matt Damon plays a politician, David Norris, who has just failed to win a senate seat from the great state of New York. He has a chance encounter with Emily Blunt's character, Elise, in the men's room of the hotel where he's about to give his concession speech. She inspires him to give a great, off-the-cuff speech about the artificiality of political campaigning and how he won't quit politics. He is presented as the quintessential honest politician. He's also the quintessential brash youth, who has gotten into a barroom brawl and other shenanigans that cost him the election.It turns out the titular Adjustment Bureau has been manipulating his life all along, including providing the ""chance"" encounter in the bathroom. Their plans are not immediately clear, other than they want him to be successful ultimately in politics. And they don't want he and Elise to meet again. They are a charming couple. Damon and Blunt have nice chemistry and the characters are well drawn enough to make the viewer root for them.Unfortunately, the Bureau itself is a bit of a let down. For all its seemingly omnipotence, omnipresence, and omniscience, is really rather inept, random, and unfocused. When people don't follow the Bureau's plans, they make little shifts (like spilling coffee to stop someone meeting) to get people to choose freely according to their plan. More than once in the movie, the Bureau guys miss their preplanned changes through incompetence or because they might interfere too much. While you certainly don't want overly competent or successful villains, their flaws and bumbles are so manifold, it's hard to believe they really are as sinister as they seem. When David first discovers that the Bureau exists and is altering people, there's no explanation how he can see the Bureau while all the ""normal"" people are frozen in time. Later, David challenges one of the Bureau's men on why they are keeping David and Elise apart. The guy has nothing to say in his own defense and David concludes that he doesn't know why. The guy is just following orders. Even when he talks to higher ups, the explanation makes little sense. The movie doesn't present the Bureau as really having its act together. They are just too ill defined and too easy to beat.It all seems a bit nonsensical, which made the movie disappointing for me. Especially since it is based on a Philip K. Dick story. I haven't read any of his books, but most of the movies based on his books (like Blade Runner, Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly, etc.) are interesting and intelligent. This movie promises to be both but does not deliver on either.",3,More interesting premise than execution,1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,2971,"['Being', 'science', 'fiction', 'fan', 'was', 'intrigued', 'premise', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'basic', 'idea', 'shadow', 'group', 'manipulating', 'people', 'according', 'own', 'plan', 'design', 'not', 'new', 'sci', 'fi', 'genre', 'Matrix', 'Inception', 'Dark', 'City', 'are', 'first', 'mind', 'political', 'thrillers', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'story', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'politician', 'David', 'Norris', 'who', 'just', 'failed', 'win', 'senate', 'seat', 'great', 'state', 'New', 'York', 'chance', 'encounter', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'character', 'Elise', 'men', 'room', 'hotel', 'where', 'give', 'concession', 'speech', 'give', 'great', 'off-the-cuff', 'speech', 'artificiality', 'political', 'campaigning', 'how', 'wo', ""n't"", 'quit', 'politics', 'presented', 'quintessential', 'honest', 'politician', 'also', 'quintessential', 'brash', 'youth', 'who', 'gotten', 'barroom', 'brawl', 'other', 'shenanigans', 'cost', 'election.It', 'out', 'titular', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'been', 'manipulating', 'life', 'including', 'providing', 'chance', 'encounter', 'bathroom', 'plans', 'are', 'not', 'immediately', 'clear', 'other', 'want', 'be', 'successful', 'ultimately', 'politics', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'Elise', 'meet', 'again', 'are', 'charming', 'couple', 'Damon', 'Blunt', 'have', 'nice', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'drawn', 'enough', 'make', 'viewer', 'root', 'them.Unfortunately', 'Bureau', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'seemingly', 'omnipotence', 'omnipresence', 'omniscience', 'really', 'rather', 'inept', 'random', 'unfocused', 'When', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'Bureau', 'plans', 'make', 'little', 'shifts', 'spilling', 'coffee', 'stop', 'someone', 'meeting', 'get', 'people', 'choose', 'freely', 'according', 'plan', 'More', 'once', 'movie', 'Bureau', 'guys', 'miss', 'preplanned', 'changes', 'incompetence', 'might', 'interfere', 'too', 'much', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'overly', 'competent', 'successful', 'villains', 'flaws', 'bumbles', 'are', 'so', 'manifold', 'hard', 'believe', 'really', 'are', 'as', 'sinister', 'seem', 'When', 'David', 'first', 'Bureau', 'exists', 'altering', 'people', 'explanation', 'how', 'can', 'see', 'Bureau', 'normal', 'people', 'are', 'frozen', 'time', 'Later', 'David', 'one', 'Bureau', 'men', 'why', 'are', 'keeping', 'David', 'Elise', 'apart', 'guy', 'nothing', 'say', 'own', 'defense', 'David', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'guy', 'just', 'following', 'orders', 'Even', 'when', 'higher', 'ups', 'explanation', 'little', 'sense', 'movie', ""n't"", 'present', 'Bureau', 'really', 'having', 'act', 'together', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'ill', 'defined', 'too', 'easy', 'beat.It', 'bit', 'nonsensical', 'made', 'movie', 'disappointing', 'Especially', 'based', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'story', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'most', 'movies', 'based', 'books', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Minority', 'Report', 'A', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'etc', 'are', 'interesting', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'be', 'not', 'deliver']",The Adjustment Bureau [DVD]

If you consider comments to be ""spoilers,"" please stop reading right now....In Spiderman II, Aunt Mae has a few words for Peter Parker, who has temporarily resigned from his superhero role: ""Lord knows, kids...need a hero -- courageous, self-sacrificing people....I believe there's a hero in all of us...that keeps us honest...gives us strength...makes us noble...and finally allows us to die with pride, even though sometimes we have to be steady and give up the thing we want the most - even our dreams.""  Personally, I think those are among the most profound comments to ever come out of Hollywood!In my religious tradition, much has been written, spoken, and lived about surrendering our will to God's will.  The incredible ""paradox,"" if you will, is that true, genuine happiness is found in this surrender.  How could it be otherwise?  God wants the absolute, absolute best for us; God knows what will bring us true happiness far, far better than we do ourselves.I am inserting another ""spoiler"" warning right here.

Paul ""John doe""","[0, 1]","Random review for The Adjustment Bureau & I have to say it's a pretty solid film released earlier this year directed by George Molfi he's been a producer mostly. Stars Matt Damon as David Norris, Emily Blunt as Elise, Anthony Mackie as Harry, John Slattery as Richardson & Terrance Smith as Thompson. Story starts off in 2006 a Congressman Congressman named David Norris is running for The Senate. Things come out about him when he was younger & it ultimately costs him The Election while he is preparing his ConcessionSpeech he meets a young lady named Elise. His speech is well received by his supporters & he goes off script even. About a month later David starts a new job & everybody is talking 2010 for another Senate  run. Then your introduced to a group known as The Adjustment Bureau. This guy named Harry is given a task to cause David to accidentally spill coffee on his shirt. Harry doesn't get to him in time. David he boards the bus & runs into Elise they start to talk & she gives him her number.  When he gets to the office he finds his Campaign Staff paused these S W  AT team looking guys he makes a run for it but he's caught & taken to some warehouse he learns about The Adjustment Bureau he wasn't suppose to see Elise he was suppose to spill coffee on his shirt go & change & miss the bus cause it's not ment to happen in the plan. He is told if you ever tell anybody about The Adjustment Bureau they will reset his mind meaning a lobotamy. You have Harry helping David on the side. So 3 years later David has been taking the same bus for 3 years hoping to see Elise again 1 day he sees her again & they reconnect. You find out that she is a ballet dancer. The Bureau tries to keep them away from each other. They mess with David when he tries to get to 1 of her recitals. They can go through doors that take them through different parts of NYC. Richardson discovers that David & Elise were meant to be together in his original plan. A guy named Thompson comes into the picture & tells him if he sticks with The Bureau's plan he will be President. He tells him if he stays with Elise he will ruin her chances of becoming a world famous dancer. These guys control the balance of what goes on in Government. Thompson uses his adjustment powers & causes Elise to fall. It sounds silly but I watch a lot of movies with ridiculous concepts & I love them. David is in fear for both of their futures so he abandons her at the hospital. 11 months later he is close to winning The Senate seat he finds out about Elise getting married Harry gives him a hat which allows them to go through doors & go any where they want in the city. David goes to the court house & finds Elise he tells her everything about The Bureau he tells her if you love me you'll go through the door which they end up in Yankee Stadium. They keep going through different doors until they end up on the roof ""The Chairman"" revises the plan & he lets David & Elise go on & live their life. I know I didn't do a good job explaning the plot I enjoyed this movie. George Nofli did a good job directing I believe this was his 1st time directing. Matt Damon I have said it A LOT I don't buy him as an action star but he is a great dramatic actor. He was great he got me involved & I cared about him & Emily Blunt I thought she was great. Anthony Mackie did a good job. John Slattery was good Terrance Smith wasn't bad.

He met Elise.They talked and kissed. but his friend, Charlie interrupted them to notice that it was the time that he should give a speech.They got to apart soon, but they both seem to fall in love with each other.After he met her, David gave supporters a arresting speech.He lost his job as a congressman, but Charlie gave him a job.It was the first day that David goes to his office David saw Elise again while commutingand at Charlie's office, he saw someones we mustnt's know due to Harry's fail (both of then).They are members of the adjustment beaureu that control that people would have fate as they should be.Harry is the one of them. He is really nice guy,he came to see David to explain who we are and what we're doing,and suggested David to give up seeing Elise as he emphasized with David.David tries to see her again for three years, he hadn't given up. And he made it.Elise once had already engaged with a guy , kind of her co-worker in the three years, but she broke up with him,as she also couldn't forget about David although she just only met and kissed him.David mustn't see her again as long as the fate that the Adjustment beaureu has.After David saw Elise, The adjustment beaureu noticed that David had off track.Some of the members of it began to try him to never see her again with their power like magic.But this time, David won. He could see her again.David went to the club with her.After that he confessed that his entire family passed away when he was still young.After that... you know? Elise came to his baby.But still the beaureu tries to break them up continuelly.Thompson twisted Elise's ankle with using the magic when she's working, to persuade David giving up.David took Elise to the hospital, but he left her there as Thompson convinced him.Elise was shocked to be left by David at the hospital without saying any.After about a year she re-engaged with the  same guy.When David has been somewhere for speech for the election camgpain, Charlie showed him the paper that Elise engaged.It seemed to lit David's match again. At the time Harry appeared as David's supporter.The day that Elise and her fiance submit the marriage paper, David tried to see her to stop getting married to him.The many members of the Adjustment beaureu chased him and tried to interrupt him so hard.But tnanks for Harry's help, David could see Elise just before their turn to submit.But the members are on the way. David ran with her with using a kind of magic with something borrowed by Harry. Elise was panicking, when she nearly submitted the paper with an other guy David appeared in front of her.That's enought to upset her.

We all have experiences and memories like that, we wonder what our lives would have been like if we did sit next to that girl, or if we did talk to her, or get her number (undoubtedly, we lay more importance on these experiences than they may deserve. They're giant `what if' moments in our lives, the path not taken). But what if that moment of decision is the intrusion of destiny or fate? And we we're supposed to be with that person? That is the theme of ""The Adjustment Bureau.""David Norris (Matt Damon) is a fast rising Congressman with a great political future.  As he is set to win his race for the Senate, a revelation comes out that puts his whole political future in question. He goes into a men's room to rehearse his concession speech and meets Elise (Emily Blunt) and they feel that instant attraction of `knowing' they should be together. But circumstances pull them apart, or do they? The next day David catches an adjustment team, headed by Richardson (John Slattery) looking like he kept the wardrobe from ""Mad Men."" The only reason Norris witnesses this is because the adjuster assigned to him, Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie), was literally asleep on the job. Richardson convinces David that it's for the best that he forget he ever saw them and that he should forget ever meeting Elise or else his destiny won't be fulfilled. Of course David can't stop thinking of Elise and sets out to find her, and the right to choose the course of his life.""The Adjustment Bureau"" is based on a Philip K. Dick short story.  For the past thirty years or so Hollywood has been availing themselves of the topsy-turvy worlds Dick created. Some of the more successful of those being ""Blade Runner,"" ""Total Recall,"" and ""A Scanner Darkly."" Where does ""The Adjustment Bureau"" fit in? Right in the middle with ""Paycheck"" Ben Affleck's Philip K. Dick based movie. Philip K. Dick's novels and short stories can really turn your head around. Dick turned reality on its head in his stories and usually turned that reality in on itself too. ""The Adjustment Bureau"" takes on the challenge of free will versus fate, and while it plays with it a bit it doesn't turn your head around, and leaves it a pretty simple discussion.The acting in ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is fine. There are no emotional pyrotechnics or great ranges explored but the characters are believable, and the chemistry between Damon and Blunt is palpable. When they kiss at their first meeting you feel the intimacy and impulsiveness of the moment.""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a nice light movie to provoke a little post movie discussion or a nice adventure and peek behind reality's curtain.

It's predecessors include Blade Runner, Total Recall, The Imposter, and The Minority Report. Like The Imposter, THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is based on a short story. It's about a man who witnesses something unexplainable and must decide how to react to it. Since the short story (which I reviewed here:The Adjustment Bureau) doesn't contain enough for a full-length motion picture, the writers fleshed out the original story and crafted a wonderful treatise on love and self-determination. And it works. Watching it, I was reminded of movie called Made in Heaven where two people search their whole lives for each other because they were in love in Heaven before they were born. That's not exactly what's going on here, but it gives you a flavor. Add the fact that THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU doesn't want them to find each other, and you have a smart, well-paced, science-fiction thriller with a side-order of romance.

Dick's short start the Adjustment Team, Adjustment Bureau is on it's own pretty much after the first 25 minutes//story wise story wise. You may know Dick's hand in the sci-fi hits as the classic Blade Runner and the not so classic Total Recall. But what they do have in common with Bureau like most of Phillip K. Dick's work there's one big mindfrak after another. This is a timely release after the success of the equally trippy ""Inception."" The premise of things not being what they seem mix with a unrequited and ill-fated romance that should never be, the romantic angle is where the short story stretches to feature length.  Matt Daemon's character learned the hard way that ""Sometimes Being early is just as bad as being late."" David Norris, a would be US senator, president even, brought back from the brink of ending his political career by a speech  inspired by a woman, Elise (Emily Blunt),who encouraged him to be more honest, later he meets her again on a bus he was ""fated"" to miss, he then arrives to a meeting on time but he witnesses situational ""fixers"" in stylish hats no human was meant to see. This is explained to his as is that he must never see the girl again, nor tell of the Bureau's existence. He is also told that ""the plan,"" made by someone they refer to as ""the Chairman"" must be followed. They warn Norris if he tells anyone he will be ""reset"", a personality lobotomy. Norris spends the next three years riding the same bus before finding the woman again, and he must risk threats that the two will lose their dreams as well as overcome the strange suited forces working to keep them apart with the advise and aid of his own bureau guardian angel Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie).The report between Matt and Emily is as fun and solid, even believable, as that between Matt and Mackie, the other suit ""antagonists have equally superb banter, especially Mr. Richardson (John Slattery) and Terrance Stamp as the Bureau's own Mr.Wolf-style fixer...

I hold a soft spot in my heart and mind for stories regarding angels, Fates (in the Greek and Roman interpretations of such), mythologies, and queries regarding free will versus pre-destination. The Adjustment Bureau covers all of that and more, without being over explanatory. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt give excellent performances, as does the supporting cast of threatening and benign ""Adjustmenters"". Watching the Adjustment Bureau is a truly exceptional experience; it is a rare film indeed, that allows me to fully escape into another reality, and let go of myself for a much needed 100 minutes.

1345182,A18HHKM6WGEF9D,B003GAMOIW,"L. Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[0, 0]","This film is unusual in that it successfully combines genres that don't often work together - sci-fi and love story, with action thrown in to boot. Because of the great chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, it is the love story that works the best. Damon is perfect as a charismatic New York politician, and Blunt is even better as a soulful, quirky, up-and-coming dancer. Casting her against Damon, rather than going with a more traditional 'leading lady'/love interest was one of the best decisions of the film.The movie is based on a story by Phillip Dick (which I have not read), in which Damon's and Blunt's characters meet by chance, and are instantly drawn to each other, but have no way to meet again. Strange men-in-black types (with hats) seem to be following Damon, and we soon discover are bent on keeping Damon and Blunt from ever finding each other. It doesn't work, they do meet, and everything goes awry from there. The movie explores themes of free will vs. fate, and I would say also different notions of religious faith and the idea of a guiding force (i.e. 'the chairman' in this film.)I was intrigued the entire time, and the only reason I can't give it 5 vs. 4 stars is that I felt the 'adjustment bureau' portrayals (the men-in-black-with-hats) were a bit cheesy. At times they were comical (especially John Slattery's portryal) and I think perhaps the film should have just gone with that comedic aspect and let this be a little more of a dark comedy. But the others played their parts straight, and so the tone was a bit off. And I felt Harry, the primary 'agent' assigned to Damon's character, never got developed enough to be the centerpiece of the movie in the way the plot set him up to be.So there was a bit of confusion on tone, and the underdevelopment of that one character. Otherwise, this was a great - and unusual - film, with fine performances by Damon and Blunt.",4,"Great Sci-Fi/Romance/Action Film, Just Falls Short of Superb",1315785600,"09 12, 2011",2011,1908,"['film', 'unusual', 'successfully', 'genres', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'work', 'together', 'sci-fi', 'love', 'story', 'action', 'thrown', 'boot', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'love', 'story', 'best', 'Damon', 'perfect', 'charismatic', 'New', 'York', 'politician', 'Blunt', 'even', 'better', 'soulful', 'quirky', 'up-and-coming', 'dancer', 'Casting', 'Damon', 'rather', 'going', 'more', 'traditional', ""'leading"", ""lady'/love"", 'interest', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'decisions', 'film.The', 'movie', 'based', 'story', 'Phillip', 'Dick', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Damon', 'Blunt', 'characters', 'meet', 'chance', 'are', 'instantly', 'drawn', 'other', 'have', 'way', 'meet', 'again', 'Strange', 'men-in-black', 'types', 'hats', 'seem', 'be', 'following', 'Damon', 'soon', 'discover', 'are', 'bent', 'keeping', 'Damon', 'Blunt', 'ever', 'finding', 'other', ""n't"", 'work', 'do', 'meet', 'everything', 'awry', 'there', 'movie', 'themes', 'free', 'will', 'vs.', 'fate', 'would', 'say', 'also', 'different', 'notions', 'religious', 'faith', 'idea', 'guiding', 'force', 'i.e', 'chairman', 'film', 'was', 'intrigued', 'entire', 'time', 'only', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', '5', 'vs.', '4', 'stars', 'felt', ""'adjustment"", 'bureau', 'portrayals', 'men-in-black-with-hats', 'were', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'times', 'were', 'comical', 'especially', 'John', 'Slattery', 'portryal', 'think', 'perhaps', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'gone', 'comedic', 'aspect', 'let', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'dark', 'comedy', 'others', 'played', 'parts', 'straight', 'so', 'tone', 'was', 'bit', 'felt', 'Harry', 'primary', ""'agent"", 'assigned', 'Damon', 'character', 'never', 'got', 'developed', 'enough', 'be', 'centerpiece', 'movie', 'way', 'plot', 'set', 'up', 'be.So', 'was', 'bit', 'confusion', 'tone', 'underdevelopment', 'one', 'character', 'Otherwise', 'was', 'great', 'unusual', 'film', 'fine', 'performances', 'Damon', 'Blunt']",The Adjustment Bureau [DVD]

This one was ""The Adjustment Bureau"" based on ""Adjustment Team"". I had high hopes.The storyline is intriguing. Angels, using iPad style devices, are tracking humanity and keeping them ""adjusted"" on their proper paths. If someone veers from the path that is set for them, they are nudged back on path. Little changes don't matter, but if someone does a large change, they are fixed.Matt Damon is a man running for New York Senate. He's on a great track for success. However, he gets distracted by an offbeat, funny dancer - played by Emily Blunt. The Adjustment Bureau is Not Happy. They need to get him back on track.SPOILER ALERTNormally I like Philip K Dick stories because of the twists and turns in them - but this one lays out almost predictably as a romantic comedy. Guy meets girl. Guy loses girl. Guy meets girl again. Hurdles appear. Guy and girl surmount them and live happily ever after.Even worse, though, it seems really forced. They meet once and kiss, maybe 10 minutes together total. Three years later they meet again on a bus for maybe 10 minutes and separate.  Then I think a year or so later they meet, have a quick lunch, and sleep together. And then he abandons her.So she also has this great guy, Adrian, who adores her. He stands by her. He takes her back after she breaks their engagement. After all of this, David pops back into her life and POOF she runs off with him again and abandons her loyal guy. All because she has a ""feeling"" that they were meant to be together.That disturbs me a lot. With all the studies about how those feelings often ride on things like eye dilation and time-of-the-month hormones and so on, do we really want to be telling people to abandon loyal, trusting boyfriends because they have an urge to kiss a guy they've never seen before?Plus, it doesn't feel like a Philip K Dick story at all. There are no real twists. Things don't always make sense. Why would an angel break all the rules to help them? Why do plans just suddenly 'change'?

In that story, Dick conceives of a secret ""Adjustment Team"" whose only function is to intervene on matters of historical importance and set us straight according to an overarching master plan.  The movie takes this concept and runs with it, adding a powerful love story between David Norris (played by Matt Damon) and Elise (played by Emily Blunt), a love that violates the master plan, presumably God's plan, who is referred to only as the ""chairman"" in the movie.  The Adjustment Bureau is called upon to set things right.Philip Dick is one of my favorite authors and his concepts are consistently mind blowing.  Although screenwriter George Nolfi took liberties with the story, addressing the issue of personal destiny vs. free will and adding layers of complexity, the result is satisfying and superior to Dick's original story, which is one of his lesser works.

This is a movie on a smaller, more intimate scale, which required greater attention to detail rather than a grand canvass, and it succeeds very well there in my opinion.

Matt Damon and Terrence Stamp are superb in their roles, and I think Dick would have been pleased with the choice of actors and how the movie turned out.

Preparing his defeat speech by himself in the men's toilet of a plush hotel - David meets a woman's who's crashed a wedding on a dare and is hiding out in the cubicles from Security. Earthy, natural and everything his crafted campaign strategy isn't - the flighty and talented British ballet dancer Elise is a breath of fresh air. He is stunned and smitten after only minutes of electrifying conversation and they quickly launch into a mutually uncontrollable snog...But mystery men who stalk the top of Manhattan buildings wearing 1940's style Trilby hats and immaculate overcoats - have other ideas. They carry with them books that show every-changing grids and expanding street maps like they're controlling people's lives. They are convinced their all-powerful 'chairman' has decreed that these two people's pathways must not converge no matter what the personal cost. So David and Elise need to be subtly 'adjusted'.Adapted from another ingenious Philip K Dick story (other adaptations include &#34;Blade Runner&#34;, &#34;A Scanner Darkly&#34;, &#34;Minority Report&#34; and &#34;Total Recall&#34;) - the look of the film is cleverly not futuristic. Director George Nolfi uses glossy uptown locations, clean-lined buildings and real world sets so that it doesn't feel like the mind-bending world of &#34;Inception&#34;. And the &#8216;God' angle doesn't get in the way of the story but only adds to it. David's struggle with his heart-versus-politics is brilliantly handled. His suddenly honest speech to the party faithful about &#34;Phrases that pulled traction with focus groups...&#34; and why his ties and shoes have the right colour and correct mount of scuffing to secure the workingman's vote - is properly brilliant writing. Then a dozing operative (a great part for David Mackie) forgets to spill coffee on Norris' shirt at exactly 7:05 a.m. one morning before he boards a bus to work - and thus begins the dance of David and Elise towards each other as fate hooks them up and they click like they did before.As you can imagine with subject matter as ropey as this - it could all have gone horribly wrong in the hands of some `name' stars that might look good but share no real vibe. But the naturalness of both lead actors goes a long way to making the audience care. There are many moments between them as characters that are genuinely touching - giggling over coffee and mobile phones - racing each other down a night street in the wet. Then David stumbles on a mind recalibration in progress in his offices and runs like any scared man would. But he's cornered in a car park by these angels of sorts and is told that not only is his relationship with Elise verboten but if he tells anyone of their existence - he'll be memory-lobotomised (but in a nice way). But love has taken hold of his heart and hers - and they make a run for a future together despite the overwhelming odds.Will freedom of choice and protecting your soul mate win the day? Well after a few trips to Yankee Stadium and the Statue of Liberty via doors that act as portals and a little help from an angel who feels his assignment is just plain wrong - they might just stand a chance - despite the efforts of a fearsome Terrance Stamp and a bumbling John Slattery (both superbly cast in their parts).Original issues are a Triple Play package coming with a Blu Ray, DVD and Digital Copy.

1345196,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B003GAMOIW,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[1, 4]","This was a very average film. The premise was interesting, but nothing was really done with it. It had the potential to be something like ""Dark City"" but it wasn't. What I really can't figure out is how this film could possibly have had a budget of 50 million dollars. That seems like a whole lot for so little.Matt Daemon uses the film to play around with his fantasies of being a politican and to preach. And according to the old formula, that requires that he be the good working-class kid from the old neighborhood in Brooklyn who suddenly rises to the top of New York politics. But no matter how many times he tries and how bad he wants it, Daemon can't come across as working class. His entire family is conveiently dead at the start of the film which further reduces him to something like a cipher. He seems to be either fantastically rich in the film or a sponge supported by his childhood friend become venture capitalist. But thats all noble because they talk about investing money in alternative energy. Alternative energy investment has become the magic water in popular culture that washes away all moral problems from characters that would otherwise be seen as greedy wall street hustlers.Daemon's political delusions run all the way up to being president. He is such a great guy that god himself has picked him to inevitably lead the country in the film. Daemon's egotism run amok weighs really heavy against the film. Its difficult to find any redeeming features in the character he plays.The heart of the film is basically a frustrated love story. He meets a dancer and its love at first sight. But they can't be together because of the effect it would have on their careers. The unintentional unexplored irony in the story is that either of them could have had love if one or the other had been willing to sacrifice their career ambitions for love. But egos being what they are, sacrifice is an alien concept. They want it all and if they have to resort to a childish tantrum to get it all, so be it. In the end, Daemon is willing to storm the gates of heaven for love but he isn't willing to give up being President to do it. Its a weakness in the film's plot and a rather nasty comment on modern culture.To work, the love story in the film has to work. But it doesn't. Its all really shallow like both of their characters.The film is also supposed to be a study of free will in life. But the film lacks any subtilty in the examining that. Every manipulation is blindingly obvious to both the characters and to the viewer. There are no real surprises to speak of with it. Nothing clever done with it.For costing 50 million dollars, this was a remarkably simple film. There appeared to be no sets to speak of. I think there was all of two effects in the film. And the speaking cast was remarkably small. John Slattery does a good job with his part. Terence Stamp delivers whats expected of him.If your looking for two hours of entertainment, its better than most. But there is nothing special or great about it.------------------------The DVD is a bit odd in that the shot alternate ending was not included.

1345200,AE9IH4LOALC7M,B003GAMOIW,Matthew Allard,"[13, 20]","""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a blend of genres: Science Fiction, Romance, Political Thriller. For the first forty mintues, the film seems to not really know what it is, beginning, oddly, as a portrait of a young politician, the personable yet rowdy David Norris (Matt Damon). Unfortunately for Norris, it seems his political career may be over after a picture of his butt emerges in the newspaper. However, after a chance (or is it fate?) encounter in the men's bathroom with none other than the beautiful Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt), he is inspired to make the single best political concession speech of his career, a sort of expos&eacute; on the phoniness of politics.Too much time is devoted to his political campaigns, with interviews from various cable news entities (Jon Stewart) thrown in there in an attempt at authenticity. All the while, we're occasionally seeing glimpses of sinister, middle aged men in trench coats and fedoras, and an overall sense that something is amiss. These men (?) walk in synchronized fashion, as if rods were up their butts, and occasionally share in small, awkward conversations with each other e.g. ""You should take some time off; even WE need vacations sometimes"". These adroit, uncomfortable beings are apparently angels, or something. ""Some have called us that"", says Anthony Mackie, straining to maintain a straight face. They are members of The Adjustment Bureau, a team of supernatural business men who control everything. Yes, everything. For reasons unknown, it is of the utmost importance that David Norris not fall in love with Elise Sellas, and whenever Norris attempts to be with her, he is thwarted by this mysterious bunch.The worst parts of Adjustment Bureau are without a doubt when the bureaucrats attempt to explain their existence. ""What about free will?"" bursts Damon, in a fit of bewilderment. They explain that they've tried free will, but humans have a tendency to screw things up when left to their own devices (hence, this movie). ""We (the adjustment bureau) brought you to the height of the Roman Empire"", explains a deadpan Terrence Stamp. ""Then, we stepped back. We watched as you destroyed yourselves; the fall of the Roman Empire, the dark ages. Then we came back in, and gave you the Renaissance, the Enlightenment. Then in 1910, we stepped back again, and watched you descend into World War I, World War II, and then bring yourselves to the brink of destruction with the Cuban Missile Crisis. Since then, we've stepped back in, before you altered the plan so irreversibly that even we wouldn't be able to save you"". Well, he knows his history! Not only is it absurd to think that this supernatural bureau went back and forth between controlling human behavior and giving us free will. But also, I guess we're supposed to assume that all of the atrocities that occurred while under the influence of the bureau were, actually, performed according to a devised plan? Slavery, the Civil War, Vietnam, September 11- these are all events that apparently occurred under the Bureau's divine influence. ""Do you ever wonder if the plan is wrong?"" submits the bold Anthony Mackie. Hmmmm, let's think about that. Or better yet, let's not.The movie then descends into laughable parody. The bureaucrats can open doors, and travel to any location through the doorways, as long as they're wearing their magical fedoras. This makes for some ridiculous chase scenes through baseball fields, banks, and my personal favorite, the Statue of Liberty. ""Teach me how to use the doors"", says Matt Damon, in a pivotal scene. Spoiler alert: all you need is a fedora, and to turn the doorknob clockwise. The bureaucrats are so powerful, and can do so many things, that it is often extremely frustrating to watch how horribly incompetent they are. Haven't they been doing this for thousands of years? Even Terrence Stamp, the bureaucrat whose nickname is ""The Hammer"", has a tough time quelling the unstoppable force that is Matt Damon.The saddest part about ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is that there's potential here for a good movie. Matt Damon is excellent as the likable politician, and the chemistry between Damon and Emily Blunt is solid. I truly think this would have been a better movie if there was no adjustment bureau, and it was simply about a young politician forming a relationship which could potentially threaten his political career. I wish I could adjust this movie's fate, abandoning it's silly premise for a simpler, better one. But I can't. Why? Because I don't own a fedora.",2,Conquer Fate: Avoid this Movie,1302393600,"04 10, 2011",2011,4532,"['Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'blend', 'genres', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Political', 'Thriller', 'first', 'forty', 'mintues', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'beginning', 'oddly', 'portrait', 'young', 'politician', 'personable', 'yet', 'rowdy', 'David', 'Norris', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Unfortunately', 'Norris', 'political', 'career', 'may', 'be', 'over', 'picture', 'butt', 'newspaper', 'However', 'chance', 'fate', 'encounter', 'men', 'bathroom', 'none', 'other', 'beautiful', 'Elise', 'Sellas', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'inspired', 'make', 'single', 'best', 'political', 'concession', 'speech', 'career', 'sort', 'expos', 'eacute', 'phoniness', 'politics.Too', 'much', 'time', 'devoted', 'political', 'campaigns', 'interviews', 'various', 'cable', 'news', 'entities', 'Jon', 'Stewart', 'thrown', 'there', 'attempt', 'authenticity', 'while', ""'re"", 'occasionally', 'seeing', 'glimpses', 'sinister', 'middle', 'aged', 'men', 'trench', 'coats', 'fedoras', 'overall', 'sense', 'something', 'amiss', 'men', 'walk', 'synchronized', 'fashion', 'rods', 'were', 'up', 'butts', 'occasionally', 'share', 'small', 'awkward', 'conversations', 'other', 'e.g', 'should', 'take', 'time', 'off', 'even', 'WE', 'need', 'vacations', 'sometimes', 'adroit', 'uncomfortable', 'beings', 'are', 'apparently', 'angels', 'something', 'have', 'called', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'straining', 'maintain', 'straight', 'face', 'are', 'members', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'team', 'supernatural', 'business', 'men', 'who', 'control', 'everything', 'Yes', 'everything', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'utmost', 'importance', 'David', 'Norris', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'Elise', 'Sellas', 'whenever', 'Norris', 'be', 'thwarted', 'mysterious', 'bunch.The', 'worst', 'parts', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'are', 'doubt', 'when', 'bureaucrats', 'attempt', 'explain', 'existence', 'What', 'free', 'will', 'Damon', 'fit', 'bewilderment', 'explain', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'free', 'will', 'humans', 'have', 'tendency', 'screw', 'things', 'up', 'when', 'left', 'own', 'devices', 'hence', 'movie', 'adjustment', 'bureau', 'brought', 'height', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'deadpan', 'Terrence', 'Stamp', 'Then', 'stepped', 'back', 'watched', 'destroyed', 'yourselves', 'fall', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'dark', 'ages', 'Then', 'came', 'back', 'gave', 'Renaissance', 'Enlightenment', 'Then', '1910', 'stepped', 'back', 'again', 'watched', 'descend', 'World', 'War', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'then', 'bring', 'yourselves', 'brink', 'destruction', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'then', ""'ve"", 'stepped', 'back', 'altered', 'plan', 'so', 'irreversibly', 'even', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'save', 'Well', 'history', 'Not', 'only', 'absurd', 'think', 'supernatural', 'bureau', 'went', 'back', 'forth', 'controlling', 'human', 'behavior', 'giving', 'free', 'will', 'also', 'guess', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'assume', 'atrocities', 'occurred', 'influence', 'bureau', 'were', 'actually', 'performed', 'according', 'devised', 'plan', 'Slavery', 'Civil', 'War', 'Vietnam', 'September', '11-', 'are', 'events', 'apparently', 'occurred', 'Bureau', 'divine', 'influence', 'Do', 'ever', 'wonder', 'plan', 'wrong', 'bold', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Hmmmm', 'let', 'think', 'better', 'yet', 'let', 'not.The', 'movie', 'then', 'laughable', 'parody', 'bureaucrats', 'can', 'open', 'doors', 'travel', 'location', 'doorways', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'wearing', 'magical', 'fedoras', 'ridiculous', 'chase', 'scenes', 'baseball', 'fields', 'banks', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'Teach', 'how', 'use', 'doors', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'need', 'fedora', 'turn', 'doorknob', 'clockwise', 'bureaucrats', 'are', 'so', 'powerful', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'often', 'extremely', 'frustrating', 'watch', 'how', 'horribly', 'incompetent', 'are', 'Have', ""n't"", 'been', 'doing', 'thousands', 'years', 'Even', 'Terrence', 'Stamp', 'bureaucrat', 'nickname', 'Hammer', 'tough', 'time', 'quelling', 'unstoppable', 'force', 'Matt', 'Damon.The', 'saddest', 'part', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'potential', 'here', 'good', 'movie', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'excellent', 'likable', 'politician', 'chemistry', 'Damon', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'solid', 'truly', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'was', 'adjustment', 'bureau', 'was', 'simply', 'young', 'politician', 'forming', 'relationship', 'could', 'potentially', 'threaten', 'political', 'career', 'wish', 'could', 'adjust', 'movie', 'fate', 'abandoning', 'silly', 'premise', 'simpler', 'better', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'fedora']",The Adjustment Bureau [DVD]

You have your thriller and sci-fi elements, but also a larger than expected dose of romance.As shown countless times in the trailers, we are all being watched and adjusted by a mysterious group of people. They remind me of the bald Observer characters on the great TV show Fringe. They keep us on track to hopefully maximize our individual potential and to prevent the human race as a whole from utter destruction. Matt Damon's character is a politician running for Senate and falls for a girl, played by Emily Blunt, which clashes with such plan. Thanks to a mistake from one of the observing agents, he meets her again on a bus by chance and The Adjustment Bureau will stop at nothing to make sure their connection is severed.Damon and Blunt are both likeable and have decent chemistry, but there just is not enough material to really sink your teeth into. It would have worked better as maybe a 30-45 minute segment in an anthology.

Enter the Adjustment Bureau, an ""agency"" whose sole purpose is to make sure no one deviates from the Master Plan.I was disappointed when I first saw The Adjustment Bureau. I thought I was sitting down to an espionage / Jason Bourne type movie, and what I got was not what I expected.However, there were some very strong elements to the movie that drew me to it a second time: ""AB"" is a unique twist on the conventional boy- meets- girl love story... the movie is a hybrid of standard chick- flick and ""Dark City."" There's a philosophical element of free will vs. predestination that runs deep in the film that some will love (myself included) and others will not. Also, the chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt is excellent, and I really enjoyed their screen time together. Their characters are very likeable. The chemistry between the two is strong enough that I actually cared whether or not he could outsmart the Adjustment Bureau and find his way back to her without them successfully keeping them apart- resulting in a handful of cross town chase sequences that are highly entertaining.The DVD sleeve claims it is a ""thriller"" but that's a bit misleading. Yes, the chases are thrilling, but make no mistake: ""AB"" is first and foremost a sci-fi romance, and a relatively light-hearted one.""AB"" has its shortcomings: I felt the movie tipped its hat too soon: you learn too early into the film who the Adjustment Bureau is (I was expecting that element of the movie to be much more mysterious); and when the big mystery is revealed (why the two protagonists are not meant to be together), I was hoping for more.Still, ""AB"" is a very enjoyable movie with enough ""meat"" on its ""bones"" to provide plenty of interesting conversation after the credits role.

These suits ensure the minutiae of life are engineered such that a lost set of keys or a spilt cup of coffee ensure you get where you should be at the right time.. or keep you from where you shouldn't be.  When by accident one of those spilt cups of coffee doesn't happen, a relationship is built between Damon and Emily Blunt, and the suits intervene - how far will he go to stay with the woman he has come to love?The leads really convince.. Matt Damon is thoroughly likeable, and the romance never seems forced.. ironically enough, given the context.  The design of the movie has a persistent kind of art deco quality, giving it a sort of timeless quality.  The `suits' are conveyed convincingly enough by Tony Slattery (Mad Men) and Anthony Mackie, with Terence Stamp coming in for the final act.  The resolution is not quite as exciting as it thinks it is, and dodges too many of the intriguing questions such a premise suggests. The movie is not the mash-up the front cover suggests when it says ""Bourne meets Inception"".. it's not got Bourne like action or grit, and it's not mind warping like Inception, or as reliant on effects.  There is a mash-up going on here though, and the question is how well does it work.  As a romantic thriller, there is chemistry, drama and tension enough to work.  As a sci-fi, there is an intriguing concept for you to mull over and leave you with some questions, and done seamlessly enough that we don't stop to question the logic or effects.  As a hybrid of both genres, it seems on slightly shakier ground, but classy enough and with enough joie de vivre to pull through.  Above all, if you like hats, give it a watch.6 /10",4,Romantic drama wrapped up in Men In Black shenanigans,1381017600,"10 6, 2013",2013,1915,"['Philip', 'K', 'Dick', 'adaptation', 'world', 'anonymous', 'suit', 'becladded', 'men', 'work', 'tirelessly', 'scenes', 'ensure', 'world', 'per', 'plan', 'Whose', 'plan', 'movie', ""n't"", 'go', 'there', 'just', 'call', 'many', 'names', 'suits', 'ensure', 'minutiae', 'life', 'are', 'engineered', 'such', 'lost', 'set', 'keys', 'spilt', 'cup', 'coffee', 'ensure', 'get', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'right', 'time..', 'keep', 'where', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'When', 'accident', 'one', 'spilt', 'cups', 'coffee', ""n't"", 'happen', 'relationship', 'built', 'Damon', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'suits', 'intervene', 'how', 'far', 'will', 'go', 'stay', 'woman', 'come', 'love', 'leads', 'really', 'convince..', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'thoroughly', 'likeable', 'romance', 'never', 'forced..', 'ironically', 'enough', 'given', 'context', 'design', 'movie', 'persistent', 'kind', 'art', 'deco', 'quality', 'giving', 'sort', 'timeless', 'quality', 'suits', 'are', 'conveyed', 'convincingly', 'enough', 'Tony', 'Slattery', 'Mad', 'Men', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'coming', 'final', 'act', 'resolution', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'exciting', 'dodges', 'too', 'many', 'intriguing', 'questions', 'premise', 'movie', 'not', 'mash-up', 'front', 'cover', 'when', 'Bourne', 'Inception', 'not', 'got', 'Bourne', 'action', 'grit', 'not', 'mind', 'warping', 'Inception', 'reliant', 'effects', 'mash-up', 'going', 'here', 'question', 'how', 'well', 'work', 'romantic', 'thriller', 'chemistry', 'drama', 'tension', 'enough', 'work', 'sci-fi', 'intriguing', 'concept', 'mull', 'leave', 'questions', 'done', 'seamlessly', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'question', 'logic', 'effects', 'hybrid', 'genres', 'slightly', 'shakier', 'ground', 'classy', 'enough', 'enough', 'joie', 'de', 'vivre', 'pull', 'like', 'hats', 'give', 'watch.6', '/10']",The Adjustment Bureau [DVD]

Doesn't that sound too familiar also?So, you have the imperfect politician, the disrepectful dancer, and the bumbling  bureaucrats, with all three running around in circles and finally with the bureaucrats giving chase to the two, trying to determine some plan.I don't think the story succeeded in what is was trying to do.  What was the story about anyway?  There's the love story.  As a love story, I'll give it 5 stars.But what about the question raised with the Chairman?  Is it a reference to God?  Is the Chairman fallible or infallible?The bureaucrats are certainly fallible, with failings.I can see how some people may have issues with the whole concept of the Chairman, the bureaucrats, and the two lovers, which points to the greater issue of predestiny and ultimately, God.But when you think about it, it is just a love story and Sci-Fi film, with a twist of some overarching hierarchy, to give it drama and action.

It is based of a Phillip K. Dick story so what it lacks in the usual heavy duty fight scenes and unreal exchanges of gun fire it makes up for in making a person think.  This is a film that tells a story and by and large does it well.  The concept of a ""guardian angel"" type of bureaucracy  overseeing the lives of critical people is fascinating and unique and the great acting, script and directing makes it seem plausible.I do believe the acting needs to be called out for special praise.  Matt Damon as the person who is exposed to the Adjustment Bureau is great as a person who wants control of his own life.

Interesting question, that has been debated by Christians and Jews - perhaps the followers of other religions too - since time immemorial. In this compelling, well crafted film, Matt Damon, as David Norris, is an up-and-coming politician - a Hollywood liberal democrat of course - who has been predestined by the Chairman and controlled by Adjustment Bureau caseworkers to accomplish bigger and better things...to include the penultimate goal of many politicians - the Presidency. He meets a young woman - Emily Blunt as Elise Sellas - after losing his first Senate race, who encourages him to be honest in his campaigning. That meeting is also planned by the Adjustment Bureau; but Elise and David fall in love...and that is not in the Bureau's plans. Elise's destiny is to be a great dancer and her chances will be diminished if she and David become a couple; and David's chances for the presidency will be ruined. That will set the stage for what is a beautiful love story, combined w/some excellent sci/fi...fiction it may be, but if you believe in religious fate, it is altogether plausible. Blunt and Damon have superb on-screen chemistry and both deliver outstanding performances. Damon, of course, is the veteran of many such performances; and while Blunt is considered an up-and-comer by comparison, she also has some superb performances on her resume...&#34;The Young Victoria&#34;, The Devil Wears Prada&#34;, etc. Anthony Mackie, John Slattery and Terence Stamp also deliver excellent performances as Bureau caseworkers.

Instead, it is a kind of metaphysical thriller, where a talented young politician doesn't fit with the plan and fights very hard to go his own way.  It is a nice twist on a totalitarianism that is adaptable and not all that bad in intent, however messy the details are.On the positive side, the chemistry between Damon (an absolutely first rate actor) and Emily Blunt is amazingly believable.  They are riveting on screen, genuinely moving, at least to me.  This is one level of the film, a kind of love story against all odds - how can they make it work when everything conspires against them.So, without playing the spoiler, Damon discovers that he is being ""managed"", indeed that he has a destiny.  He is a remarkable young politician, somewhat rebellious but committed to changing things.  He has always felt a certain emptiness, an emotional hole within himself that he is attempting to fill with the ""people's love"" as he climbs the political ladder.  Then, he has a chance meeting with an extraordinary young woman, and enters an adventure that is as indescribable as it is complex and ultimately impossible to limn.  He feels fulfilled, which violates the logic of his destiny.

I liked the shot of the two leads, hand in hand, on the run from...well, I had no idea...but I wanted to find out. I also could not get over just how gorgeous Emily Blunt looked. Now, please do not misunderstand me, I have been well aware of her ever since first seeing her in The Devil Wears Prada, and more recently in The Young Victoria (a very good film you also should check out). But, I had never seen her look this stunning. I was like, wow....I hope thalia989 doesn't read that.Ironically, however, as anxious as I was to check out the movie (yes, I purchased it on the spot), I didn't get around to viewing it until recently...and am only now getting around to reviewing it. It is a great movie, and one you should definitely check out.The Adjustment BureauDirected by George Nolfi, and based on the short story, Adjustment Team, by science-fiction author Phillip K. Dick (whose literary works have been ""converted"" into theatrical films such as Total Recall, and the incomparable science-fiction masterpiece, Blade Runner), The Adjustment Bureau is, on its surface, a romantic, roller-coaster ride of an action thriller featuring two young lovers who want, more than anything else in the world, to be together...they just happen to have everything...and I do mean everything, working against them.Going a bit deeper, ok, a lot more deeper, themes such as pre-destination, free will, and The Enlightenment permeate the entire movie...which is about a young, ""rock-star"" New York Congressman, David Norris (Matt Damon), and his current bid to run for the United States Senate (a not-so-coincedental parallel to President Barack Obama in 2004). At a speech/fund-raiser, David steps into the men's room to catch a breather and gather his thoughts. Unbeknownst to David (but not for long) also hiding in the bathroom...for ostensibly the same reasons is Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt). David, immediately attracted to her (and vice-versa) asks her what she is doing in he men's room. She replies that she is ""hiding"" from security because ""I just crashed a wedding."" David says that ""I didn't know people still did that,"" and quickly, all of the small talk leads to a passionate, lingering  kiss. It is ""out-of-the-blue,"" yet works beautifully. As a viewer, not only did it not surprise me, it made perfect sense (more on this later). Elise, however, abruptly states she has to go and David, disappointed but inspired, goes back out to the floor and makes a speech that all but guarantees his election.A few weeks later, he has a chance encounter with Elise on an AM  bus and gets her phone number. However, David has to commit her number to memory as the feisty Elise accidentally (or, on purpose?) drops his cell phone into his cup of coffee.This is where things really start to get weird.David arrives at his office, and, well...I refuse to tell you what happens here, but let's just say that there are a group of men, splendidly sartorially attired--which includes hats (hint, hint)--and they have the ability to transport themselves through time and space. It may sound silly, but trust me, it isn't. They also have a message for David: he is--very soon--going to be President of the United States, and a great president at that.One more thing: he also better stay away from Elise and have no more contact with her. Even worse, if he tells her--or anyone else--about this meeting, and its revelations, they will........I am not giving away anything else about this movie's plot. It would be a crime if I spoiled it for you...so I won't. I will tell you that from this point forward you will have completely, as the movie's viewer, entered a mad, alternate fantasy world that will take you on a frantically-paced run as you follow David and Elise's story, all throughout it. You will also stay on the edge of your seat rooting for these two characters to somehow find a way to be together...all the time hoping that, by the movie's end, that you won't be disappointed.So, go see the movie to find out how all of this is going to play out! I am not saying anything else about its story. However, I will talk about......A Few More Things That I Liked* The chemistry between the two leads, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. I still cannot get over just how strong their said chemistry was. Going into this, I had no idea what the movie was about or what to even  expect...but, from their first encounter on, these two actors equally radiate the screen--and show us exactly what great acting is all about. I am not usually interested in strictly romantic films--however, from their aforementioned first ""chance"" meeting in the men's room, and all throughout the film, I found myself strongly wanting the two to be together by movie's end in a way that reminded me of James Stewart and Kim Novak in Vertigo. Just two great performances.* Emily Blunt. She completely radiates the screen as Elise. Now granted, I am attracted to ""arty-type"" girls to begin with, but wow...her role as a feisty, completely self-assured, free-spirited ballet dancer just captivated me. And, did I mention she looks gorgeous?Side note: I have wondered if my ""captivation"" is due to the fact I also (big mrroland secret here) would like to dance, myself, if I could (being a 6'4"", 220 lbs. klutz doesn't lend itself very well to dancing).* The movie's supporting cast. No matter how good a movie's leads are, it cannot be a great film unless they are surrounding by an exceptional cast. This is certainly the case here as Michael Kelly, Anthony Mackie, John Slattery and (another ""incomparable"") Terence Stamp all turn in their usual fine performances. There is one scene in particular with Mr. Stamp that I especially noted: After a romantic interlude between David and Elise, they lie in bed asleep...with Terence Stamp's character, Thompson, unbeknownst to them, gazing down hauntingly at them. A great, yet (more than a bit) eerie, visual.* The movie's pacing. What can I say about this...other than everything is done right. Director George Nolfi expertly sets up the first meeting between our two leads, then continues to let the movie play out at a perfect pace...right up to the film's climax. The movie's action never feels rushed, yet the suspense level is on ""High"" throughout the film. It never lets up. Another great job.* I also very much enjoyed the movie's score. It is composed by Thomas Newman (The Shawshank Redemption, American Beauty) and lends itself well to the movie's suspense, haunting visuals and pacing. In short, it does what it is supposed to do: it helps make the movie great.* Finally, I appreciate the fact that, despite Matt Damon's character being a politician, the movie mostly avoids politics and agenda and instead concentrates on storytelling. I watch movies purely for entertainment and escapism, and do not want to be ""preached"" to--even if I agree with what they are ""preaching."" This movie, thankfully--and to its credit, leaves the politics ""at home.""The DVDExtras include:* Deleted and Extended Scenes. There is no ""special edition"" present where these extra scenes are inserted seamlessly into the actual movie, but they do add to your viewing enjoyment and better understanding of this movie's story--and just what exactly the film's director and producers were trying to say.* Three Featurettes: Leaping Through New York, Destined To Be and Becoming Elise.Leaping Through New York is a brief (7:37) look at the making of the film, in particular, how they achieved the ""teleporting"" special effects. Lots of making-of footage--shot on location in The City--is also shown, with Matt Damon summing it all up by saying visually, ""the movie is a love letter to New York.""Destined To Be is a short (4:52) featurette that discusses the movie's theme of fate versus free will, with both leads discussing how far (are) their characters willing to go to be together--and what happens when you defy fate, itself.Becoming Elise (7:07)--yes, this was of great interest to me. It discusses Emily Blunt's preparation for her role of Elise (as a dancer) and describes the dance training (and diet) she underwent as she ""became"" the character of Elise. I was amazed at just how much dance training she went through, especially considering that her on-screen ""dance time,"" by comparison, is not very long at all.* Lastly, we get an excellent commentary from Director George Nolfi. This, as film commentaries go, is outstanding. He discusses special effects; the movie's shooting in and around NYC; the chemistry between the film's two leads; (and) the movie's themes. This is arguably the best film commentary I have ever heard (definitely on my short list) and a ""must-listen"" for all fans of this movie.So, in conclusionI (easily) rate this film with five very strong stars. Along with The Avengers, this was the best movie I have seen this year (2012). It is so strange: I had never heard of this movie when it was in development, nor when it was playing in the theaters. It was only sheer chance that I happened upon it on a lazy Friday afternoon. I am just so very glad I did finally see it--and I have to ask myself two questions:* How did I not notice--considering it grossed $127,869,379 dollars worldwide--this film (much) earlier?* Considering my ignorance of this film's existence, how exactly did I ever manage to notice this film at all--could it have been...fate?Thank you for reading.The Adjustment Bureau* Written and directed

Matt Damon and Emily Blunt's characters are thrown together and torn apart, all according to a divine master plan.  Can this master plan be altered?  The characters jump through literal hoops to be together despite supernatural forces contriving one scheme after another to keep them separated.According to this movie, free will is an illusion.  Keep in mind that so many belief systems are based on the premise of free will.  Yet while the Adjustment Bureau won't let us choose our life partner, we are free to decide which brand of toothpaste we want.  I had to laugh and can completely relate to this theme.  So many times I've felt like I do not have complete free will.  There have been times when words I hadn't even thought popped out of my mouth, as though the words were foisted by a ventriloquist.  Another time I felt supernaturally manhandled when I momentarily lost control of my balance and equilibrium (medically, postural hypotension, though it felt more like untoward supernatural possession).

David Norris is a politician on his way up.  But on the night of the election he is losing badly due to an unflattering photo appearing in the New York Post (yeah, it happens).  He meets a girl in the mens' room who is running from security as she crashed a wedding (how, why or when is never explained).After a five minute conversation they kiss passionately right there in the mens' room.  Yeah, like that would happen, but it's Hollywood.There is an organization which runs behind the lines controlling Man to some ultimate destiny.  It was explained that when Man was not guided, the Dark Ages and being on the brink of nuclear destruction with the Cuban Missile Crisis followed.Despite these clear explanations, David Norris still wants the girl even though it would ruin his career and hers.  He abandons her at first and then changes his mind.  He wears his magic hat and runs through doors which act as portals to different areas of the city.  We get to see a freaked-out girl and the sewers of New York, both of which are not pretty to see.Ending:  No spoiler, but I was not impressed.  The ending was predictable.

Although he's not hard to look at, it's really his characters that stand out more. He never tries to be too cute or too masculine--he's just a strong performer, and this film is an example of that.The film is about a team called the Adjustment Bureau who are doing everything within their powers to make sure that David Norris (played by Damon) does not get off-track for an election. They think he's good enough to be the president, but if he ends up meeting and falling in love with Elise Sellas (played by Emily Blunt), then that'll change her future as a dancer and his political future. While David is fighting to hold on to Elise, Elise has no idea that there's a team hell bent on making sure the two don't end up together, and when David finds out he has to make a decision that'll affect both of their lives for the worst, she may not be too happy.Doesn't that just sound like a good plot?

The Adjustment Bureau is a silly, convoluted story that suggests human destiny and fate are not a result of freewill, but rather controlled by a bunch of federal agent looking dudes in fedoras. Our entire lives are written in a script and if at any point it looks as though we may go off script the fedora wearing dudes are there to make Adjustments to ensure that we stay on path.While carrying a concept that sounded kind of cool with a trailer that made the movie seem like an action / sci-fi flick, it turned out to be more of an oddly placed love story in the middle of an action / sci-fi flick. Damon shines as a presidential candidate that becomes aware of the Bureau due to his path going off course in the form of a romance with Blunt. The dialogue between Damon and Blunt was entertaining and fun to watch, but the weird ""Damon wants to be with Blunt; the Bureau doesn't want him to be with Blunt; the Bureau will now go through a magic door and change your destiny"" dynamic got tiring and I found myself poking holes in the plot the whole way through the movie versus sitting back and enjoying the show.So I would say don't put The Adjustment Bureau at the top of your queue.

Could you have made it taking a different route or leaving earlier? The guy just a few people behind you purchased the winning lottery ticket and you wonder; what if you had listened to that nagging urge to linger in the store longer instead of rushing to get out? All the times you wonder or wished you were at the right place at the right time. Is it dumb luck that these opportunities are missed or is it by design? This movie puts together a very interesting and compelling possibility to what drives the direction our lives take. The Adjustment Bureau will make you wonder if there is anybody pulling your strings as well.The Adjustment Bureau is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick; the author whose work has been adapted to movies like Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, Paycheck, A Scanner Darkly and more. While the movie deviates a little from the short story the general premise is the same. In the movie an up and coming politician (Matt Damon) runs into a girl by chance and falls in love. The problem is he wasn't supposed to. And a mysterious organization that controls the direction of people's lives gets involved. From that comes an interesting web of intrigue that is one part conspiracy theory and one part fantasy. It runs like a both a drama and a light thriller.What makes the movie good is how much it gives you early on. There is no pretense as to what is going on. From the get go Damon knows there is an adjustment bureau and he knows what they do. The point of the story is what he does in spite of the fact he knows his destiny is being controlled, especially when it comes to that destiny depriving him of the woman he loves. The movie is also good because of how little it gives you. Who are the adjustment bureau? Are they angels with God as their Chairman? Are they aliens guiding our development? Are they something else entirely? You get enough to know they are out there and what they can do, however you don't get any answers on who they are or why they are doing this. This really makes the movie shine because it leaves the viewer to their own philosophical questions instead of being spoon fed everything.As I said before this movie is mostly a drama. Maybe a romantic drama. However there are instances of intrigue and even a bit of action. No explosions, gun play or fight choreography. However you do get a few chase scenes that do up pace of the film effectively. All in all there is a good balance of exposition, romance and action to make the movie flow smoothly without getting boring or frantic. Acting is most effective with the emotionless bureau operatives not acting like robots; just detached. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt have excellent chemistry and pull off an effective relationship portrayal. The cinematography is spot on and takes advantage of some gorgeous Manhattan scenery that help bring some variation between scenes.This Blu-Ray video is 1080p VC-1 and looks really, really good. There have been some debate that the VC-1 codec is inferior to AVC, but I couldn't tell any inferiorities with this disc. The visuals are sharp and impressive, however this is not an eye candy type film so I wouldn't use it as a gauge for Blu-Ray hardware. The audio is clear with the right kind of atmosphere on the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track (there is also a Spanish and French DTS 5.1 track). The dialog is important on this film, and the BD mix keeps the dialog in the forefront, which is a good thing.The BD release has all the same bonus features as the DVD, and as a bonus they are in high definition. There is also an additional featurette not available on the DVD. Here is the breakdown:Feature Commentary by Writer-Director George Nolfi -  It's a little sparse, but when he does make comments they are pretty informative. No commentaries from the cast or rest of the crew.Deleted and Extended Scenes (1080p - 6:64) - Seven deleted and extended scenes. Most of the footage is apparently a character (caseworker Henderson) they decided to cut completely out of the movie. They are kind of funny scenes, but I can see how that distracts the flow.Labyrinth of Doors (1080p - 33:57) - This is the Blu-Ray exclusive and is an interactive featurette where you go through doors to get to either film clips or behind the scenes footage. The running time is a total of the various small clips.Leaping Through New York (1080i - 7:36) - This bonus focuses on the on location shooting and has interviews as well as an overview of the process.Destined to Be (1080i - 4:51) - Interviews with Matt Damon and Emily Blunt regarding the romance angle between the two characters.Becoming Elise (1080i - 7:08) - Interviews with Emily Blunt regarding the preparation she did for the character. This includes a healthy dose of behind the scenes footage showing the training she did for the dancing she had to do for her role.Digital Copy - An activation code for you to download the movie from a website.BD-Live - A chance to download additional content if they ever make any. You can also rent other Universal movies through BD-Live.pocketBLU - Communicate with the BD with your mobile device.My Scenes - A way to make your own movie clips.News Ticker - Annoying advertising from Universal.D-Box - If you have a D-Box chair (moves and shakes to movies) this is a code for you to use it on this film.The Adjustment Bureau is a fascinating look into the concept of your future being predestined. It is done in such a way that doesn't get too far into the fantasy element and has a lot to offer a broad spectrum of viewers.

Matt Damon and Emily Blunt play perfectly off of each other while the sci-fi plot tosses enough compassion and endearment in to keep cynicism in check. It's the kind of movie I relish, in no small part because I'm a gigantic sucker for the magical power of true love.Furthermore, I love this movie because it is the kind of movie that reminds me of the great movies from the 30s and 40s - optimistic movies that take the world we live in and people we can relate to and put them in situations that reveal their strong sense of truth and the goodness in humanity as well as their unfailing belief in love.I admit that it's way too easy to knock The Adjustment Bureau for being heavy-handed and hokey, and it is without a doubt.

1345268,A2S0FCE1GYVKBT,B003GAMOIW,"Steve ""metsfansince1962""","[2, 3]","Based on a  Philip K. Dick short story, The Adjustment Bureau has romance and action going for it, with a touch of comedy and philosophy, too. It's science fiction, but unlike the futuristic Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report (also films based on Dick's works), it's set in the present.Basically, the film poses this question: Can free will, determination, and love triumph over determinism? Matt Damon is a young politician on the rise, who is programmed to do well with the public, with everything he does selected by consultants, who run things by focus groups--right down to which tie he wears. Emily Blunt (who plays a dancer) is there to inspire him to make a great concession speech, and then is supposed to vanish from his life, but the Adjustment Bureau (charged with making sure the right events occur, with the right people in power) screws up, and they fall in love.Damon and Blunt are terrific as the romantic leads, and Terence Stamp, Anthony Mackie, and John Slattery (all of whom must wear fedoras, which allow them to get through special doors to do their adjustment work quickly in New York City, in which the film takes place) are good in supporting roles.This is an entertaining and moving film, which somehow imparts enjoyment without the usual explosions and long car chases, although there are a couple of scenes which drag on a bit. All in all, I recommend this film for its romance, action sequences, good acting, and decent direction.",4,A good romantic science-fiction film,1299369600,"03 6, 2011",2011,1473,"['Based', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'short', 'story', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'romance', 'action', 'going', 'touch', 'comedy', 'philosophy', 'too', 'science', 'fiction', 'futuristic', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Minority', 'Report', 'also', 'films', 'based', 'Dick', 'works', 'set', 'present.Basically', 'film', 'question', 'Can', 'free', 'will', 'determination', 'love', 'triumph', 'determinism', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'young', 'politician', 'rise', 'who', 'programmed', 'do', 'well', 'public', 'everything', 'selected', 'consultants', 'who', 'run', 'things', 'focus', 'groups', 'right', 'tie', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'who', 'dancer', 'there', 'inspire', 'make', 'great', 'concession', 'speech', 'then', 'supposed', 'vanish', 'life', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'charged', 'making', 'sure', 'right', 'events', 'occur', 'right', 'people', 'power', 'up', 'fall', 'love.Damon', 'Blunt', 'are', 'terrific', 'romantic', 'leads', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'John', 'Slattery', 'whom', 'must', 'wear', 'fedoras', 'allow', 'get', 'special', 'doors', 'do', 'adjustment', 'work', 'quickly', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'film', 'place', 'are', 'good', 'supporting', 'roles.This', 'entertaining', 'moving', 'film', 'somehow', 'imparts', 'enjoyment', 'usual', 'explosions', 'long', 'car', 'chases', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'drag', 'bit', 'recommend', 'film', 'romance', 'action', 'sequences', 'good', 'acting', 'decent', 'direction']",The Adjustment Bureau [DVD]
1345269,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B003GAMOIW,Steven Aldersley,"[6, 7]","The Adjustment Bureau (Romance, Sci-Fi, Thriller)Directed by George NolfiStarring Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Anthony MackieUniversal Studios | 2011 | 106 min | Rated PG-13 | Released Jun 21, 2011Video:Video codec: VC-1Video resolution: 1080pAspect ratio: 1.85:1Audio:English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1French: DTS 5.1Spanish: DTS 5.1Subtitles:English SDH, French, SpanishDiscs:50GB Blu-ray DiscDVD copyDigital copy (on disc)The Film 4/5I almost went to see The Adjustment Bureau at the theater, but generally negative reviews made me decide to wait for the Blu-ray release. The same was true of Clint Eastwood's Hereafter, also starring Matt Damon. I'm going to have to trust my instincts more because I found both movies entertaining.So why the negative reviews?What do you expect from a Matt Damon movie? His biggest role was as Jason Bourne in the hugely successful trilogy and I think he's expected to be an action hero in every role he plays. That's simply not the case. The man can act and he has a lot more to offer than some give him credit for. The marketing for The Adjustment Bureau is selling it as an action movie, but it's actually a love story with a science fiction element. The front cover shows Damon and Blunt running. They do run in the movie, but that's not the point of the story.This is not an action movie.David Norris (Damon) is running for Senate and he's losing. He meets Elise (Blunt) in a bathroom and they kiss. A brief conversation influences his concession speech and he decides to be completely honest with the assembled crowd. This is not typical behavior for a politician. The entire meeting was arranged without his knowledge just for the purpose of influencing his speech.We are introduced to four men in suits and hats. They look like the Men in Black. What is their origin and why and how are they trying to influence events? One has an assignment to delay Norris by making him spill coffee on his shirt, but he fails to intervene in time. As a result, Norris walks into his office and sees the men altering the memories of his colleagues. He runs, but is quickly caught. They make him promise to keep their secret. They also demand that he drops any interest in Elise as the two aren't supposed to be together.Norris isn't ready to give up on Elise and feels strongly attracted to her. He searches for years and eventually tracks her down. The Adjustment Bureau fails to anticipate his resourcefulness and level of determination. In order to prevent the relationship, other methods are tried to tear the two apart. Norris is given some strong reasons to walk away from Elise. Will they be enough, or will his attraction toward her prove to be too strong?Philip K. Dick wrote the short story on which the movie is based. He was also responsible for Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, which resulted in Blade Runner being made. I'm not saying that the Adjustment Bureau is on the same level, but it's certainly a thought-provoking story worthy of your time.Think about fate and predestination for a moment. Do you live your life thinking that every step has been mapped out? If that were the case, why bother to do anything? Do you think that your overall destination has been decided, but it's up to you how you get there? That would at least give your actions some meaning. Or do you think that everything is random and there's no reason or purpose behind anything we do? The Adjustment Bureau raises similar questions. You might be able to predict how the movie ends, but the fun is experiencing the journey.Emily Blunt has good chemistry with Damon and the casting was spot on. She had to learn how to look like a ballet dancer for the part and she was utterly convincing in the role.I love the Bourne movies, but I'm a fan of Damon's acting in general. It dates back to Good Will Hunting and Rounders. In fact, I've rarely seen Damon disappoint. Hereafter and The Adjustment Bureau will stay in my collection and I'm happy to own them. If you give The Adjustment Bureau a try without expecting an action movie, you might end up enjoying it as much as I did.Video Quality 4/5While most recent releases use the MPEG-4 AVC codec, The Adjustment Bureau uses VC-1. The result isn't bad, but I've seen more striking presentations. Grain is moderately thick and detail is average. Many of the scenes have an intentional blue tint, but colors are otherwise accurate. I wouldn't complain about the picture quality, but it's far from exceptional.Audio Quality 4/5The English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix does a good job for the most part. Dialogue is clear, apart from in noisy settings when it's not supposed to be. When Norris is talking to the crowds of people, the atmosphere seems realistic and sounds are separated well. There are no gunshots or explosions, but the sound quality is good throughout.Special Features 2.5/5Audio Commentary by Writer/Director George Nolfi.Deleted and Extended Scenes (6:54)Labyrinth of Doors - A Google Map allowing you to explore various parts of New York. Each door offers a small feature; normally under a minute long. It's a lot of work to navigate through everything and the reward doesn't seem worth it.Leaping Through New York (7:36) - Showing the wide range of locations used during the shoot.Destined to Be (4:51) - Damon and Blunt talk about the casting process and their characters.Becoming Elise (7:08) - How Blunt learned how to become a dancer for the role. Acting can be hard!The Adjustment Bureau asks some interesting questions. It's well-acted and kept my interest for the 106-minute duration. The mystery element and slow exposition have the effect of placing the viewer in the same situation as David Norris, and it works effectively. If you go in with the right expectations (not anticipating explosions and constant action), the story has a lot to offer.Overall score 4/5",4,An unconventional love story; not an action

Don't let the title throw you and watch with your girlfriend or partner, a very straightforward and satisfying story of romance. The difference between this romance and others is the sci-fi connection thriller conjured up by the author of the original 1954 short story, Phillip K Dick.  Philip wrote 121 stories over his lifetime and renowned for film adaptations of his works (including but not limited to) Blade Runner, Minority Report, Paycheck and Total Recall. Late 2011/12 is expected to see Ridley Scott complete (Blade Runner producer and fan of Phillip) the BBC  4 part min drama ""The Man in the High Castle"" and even a Disney release of ""King of Elves"" is due soon. So get in early and see this first in a wave of adaptations of Phillip's works. With regard to the lead actors Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are perfectly cast not over the top just acting as two real people in love. The Adjustment Bureau team is aptly cast with Terence Stamp and the lesser known but highly talented Anthony Mackie. If you decide to buy the movie get a Blu-RayThe Adjustment Bureau [Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy] as the scenes are stunning along with the limited action making use of rain soaked New York streets.

One would be wrong then.I didn't run to the theater to see either this or the Source Code not that they didnt look appealing in various ways, but neither gave me the impression that any new ground was being broken, and thus, it could wait until Blu-ray.  I was wrong then.This is easily one of the best movies I've seen all year, and again, it you had warned me it was essentially a slightly-theological romantic-actioner, I'd probably have skipped it.  What the movie has is strong, believeable acting, effects that don't overshadow the plot, a plot that is thought provoking and original, well written AND delivered dialogue, and a certain ""heart"", if you will, that most movies these days are lacking.Damon's done a lot of work up to this point in his career, and Matt Damon purists might cry foul, but I think this is one of his strongest movies yet.  When the actor and the character flow easily together, like they do in this film, there is a genuine quality that brings this performance easily to the top of the list.  Strong lines, coupled with a tangible chemistry between he and his supporting actors (most notably Emily Blunt, whose time on screen with Damon reminds me of Clooney and Lopez in Out of Sight in its believeability), make an already impressive career even stronger.  You root for Damon in this film because he shows his connection with Blunt, with his best-friend/campaign manager, with the Bureau Agents.  His everyman-vibe has never been more ""real"", and never been more likable.The movie moves at a quick pace, and says what it came to say in just over 90 minutes, which is a rare accomplishment in its own right.

The chairman uses ""angels"" to control the outcome of major events in the world by tweaking people's thoughts and sometimes causing accidents and deaths.Matt meets a girl and they immediately hit it off, however they were never supposed to meet again as that would change the game plan. When they do, it sends ripples through that ultimate game plan, apparently flexibility is not one of the Chairman's virtues. The movie is about them trying to be together vs. fate keeping them apart.

While that may sound like a set up for a romantic movie, in ""The Adjustment Bureau,"" it could destroy the world as 'The Chairman' has planned. As loosely based on a story by Phillip K Dick, the adjusters come to Earth at the orders of the Chairman to quietly make little tweaks so the world runs just as it should. Trouble is, Damon and Blunt are not supposed to be in the plan.In Dick's story, Damon's Dick Norris is not a rising polition, but some grey suit in an office who stumbles into the adjusters, who happen to be dogs. In the story, the dog is supposed to bark and delay Damon. In this case, the adjusters are given human form and magic fedoras that make John Slattery look like he just crossed the street from shooting Mad Men, but in the movie give them the power to navigate strange portals (a store door that opens to Yankee Stadium, for example) and make things work as the Chairman sees fit.Religious Allegory much? While that is never mentioned, Chairman = God gets pretty obvious and tiresome as the movie stretches out. While Dick's original story was deeply misogynistic, at least Blunt is given a woman who could conceivably be the strong character Damon would fall for. Ultimately, the fate versus freewill argument consumes the movie and the holes begin taking up more space than the magic doors.

The sci-fi romance greatly benefits from the palpable chemistry between the believable characters they play, a Congressman David Norris by Damon and a ballet dancer Elise Sellas by Blunt. Without the capable stars, ""The Adjustment Bureau,"" though it has some interesting ideas, might have been just another lukewarm thriller.""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a romance with a sci-fi twist, in which Damon's David meets Blunt's Elise after his unsuccessful run for Senator. They are meant for each other and that's what they (and we) think. Things turned out differently when ""The Adjustment Bureau"" steps in, with their own agenda to follow.It is obvious that the film is trying to raise questions about free will and fate, but honestly I could not take the slickly told but not-so-convincing story very seriously. If these guys working for the Bureau are entrusted with such powers as shown in one office scene, why not use them to get the results they want? And why those hats and doors? Those guys are apparently governed by a certain set of rules, rules that we do not really know.Writer/first-time director George Nolfi keeps the story going. The story is sometimes told at a fast pace. The climactic ""chase"" sequence is one good example.

""There Will Be Blood"" is a well made movie with a powerful performance by the lead actor, however, when the movie ends, it's a let down. ""There Will Be Blood"" lacked thematic originality. Then there are movies that are not overly innovative from a production standpoint, however, are powerful thematically. ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is this kind of movie. The journey of the main characters was interesting, but, whenever the narrative lines converge at the end with a chase scene - we've seen this format many times. It's this movie's theme where its real beauty is revealed. Having the courage and the determination to set your own course in life despite society's rules is this movie's true allegorical meaning. Social psychologists call them introjects. And they are instilled in us from the day we are born. By our parents first, our communities, our government. Introjects are so powerful that we don't realize, at times, we are being controlled by them. When a student, whose love is art, decides to major in business because our society dictates business is more practical and socially acceptable, this is an introject. The Adjustment Bureau represents everything citizens do because of our societal memberships that go against our truest self. This is this movie's message. And a powerful message it is. Despite the movie's powerful theme, this movie grossed less than 70 million domestically. Perhaps the story's plot did not raise the stakes quite high enough. To give up the presidency of the US at a time of tremendous national economic flux does not seem like a difficult choice to make. Citizens have not been terribly happy with the current president of the US or his predecessor. In this day and time, citizens would easily chose love over a perceived failure of national leadership. Perhaps this is the reason the movie didn't fair well at the box office. The decision to chose love over politics made by the main character (Matt Damon) is not a difficult one to make in this day and time. Despite this inconsistency, there is still something extremely alluring and genuine about this movie that transcends its narrative flaws. It's a message of hope and optimism against all odds that is this movie's promise. This message of hope, optimism and confidence is surely not coming from Washington DC.

1345292,A1YYA7TDET32WC,B003GAMOIW,"Ugur Akinci ""Fortune 500 Tech Writer""","[1, 3]","Based on a Phil Dick story, this is a film brought to life by credible performances by Matt Damon (as the ambitious young NY politician David Norris),  the gorgeous Emily Blunt (as Elise, the elusive beauty/dancer whom David meets by happenstance and pursues despite all odds and mishaps), and John Slattery (who can do no wrong in any role as he again doesn't disappoint as the Adjustment Bureau's mid-management enforcer Richardson).The gist of the story is whether we have free will or not. The film starts with a stark ""NO"" for an answer. David thinks otherwise, so he needs a lesson and his lesson is delivered in the form of a nightmarish visit from the film-noir cast of the Adjustment Bureau (all wearing fedora hats) and the admonition that David can't say a word of what he has seen to anybody, or else... his brain will be reset, and his mind will be wiped out. If the Bureau is flushed out to the public domain, the gig will be up. (So can the Bureau control everything but the occasional indiscretion of its victims? Isn't that a contradiction in terms?)What's more, the Bureau also forbids David to continue his relationship with Elise since she has a different fate and his rising success as a young politician is not commensurate with her success as a dancer in a modern dance company. He is made to understand that his love for her will have a very high cost if he owns up to it, period. He'd better let go of her, right away. Like yesterday.So how does the Bureau enforce its mandate over David's life? By assigning ""case officers"" to David and arranging ""little accidents"" of daily life which are anything but. The next time you spill coffee on yourself while riding public transportation you can believe that it's an accident, or that the Bureau is earning its pay.However, at the end the Bureau relents and throws in the towel because they are impressed with the risks David take to be with Elise. So instead of David ""seeing the light"" and giving in, the Bureau is the one who give him a break since they're impressed by the love David and Elise have for one another.Yet, after all is said and done, the story remains as unconvincing and contrived at the end of it as it was in the beginning. For some reason I couldn't suspend my disbelief all throughout the film. I kept repeating to myself ""there is no way this is true or can ever happen the way the director says it does!"" For some reason I could not lose myself in this film which is necessary for a seamless movie experience. Which makes me wonder: would I enjoy The Matrix, once upon a time my all-time favorite sci-fi flick, if I go back now and watch it again?

Can you even stop it? These questions are the basis of the Adjustment Bureau, where Matt Damon's character, a promising senate nominee, is unintentionally exposed to the dealings of the 'Bureau'. He manages to stumble upon something he was never supposed to see, and sort of threatened to keep quiet about it, or else risk his whole memory being erased. He doesn't ask too many questions, and actually keeps going with the flow, except for one aspect. He meets a woman, played by Emily Blunt and instantly feels something. He can't explain it, but in his mind, she is the one for him. But unfortunately, she is not in his pre-fated path and the folks at the Adjustment Bureau tell him as much. He cannot be with her in any capacity and refuse to give him a reason as to why. This is mostly the entire plot of the film.After Blunt's character, an aspiring ballet dancer, dissapears for a while, Damon pines after her, trying in vain to locate her with no luck. Then after 3 years, as if by chance, he finds her again, and has the Adjustment Bureau guys on his back yet again. But this time he refuses to take no for an answer. I suppose this is more of a romantic film, rather than a thriller or mystery. The plot is very thin and never seems to want to be more. The Bureau men wear hats and can turn any door in NY into their own personal gateway to wherever they want to get to. There are glimpses of intrigue, but it never goes very far.Matt Damon is Matt Damon, not great, not poor. Emily Blunt is sweet and passive, but as usual has a great screen presence. The other characters are all part of the Bureau and are not terribly interesting. My one huge gripe with the film is the ending. I don't want to say it wasn't satisfying, but for me, it changed the whole message of the film, especially after the whole speech about what happened to the world throughout history when the Bureau did not interfere with anyone's lives...

1345302,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B003GAMOIW,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[2, 2]","The Adjustment Bureau, directed by George Nolfi and starring Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, is something of a rarity - a romance movie within a sci-fi setting that actually works. The reason for this is that while The Adjustment Bureau is nominally based on a short story - ""The Adjustment Team"" - by Philip K. Dick, at its heart its true roots are to be found in Michael Powell's 1946 romantic fantasy film Stairway To Heaven (also known by its original UK title A Matter Of Life And Death), where two people who meet by chance and fall in love must deal with divine powers bent on seperating them.A rising young New York politician, David Norris (Matt Damon), on election night of his first senate bid, has a chance meeting with a young dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) that changes his life. But unfortunately he comes away from the encounter with only her first name and nothing else, leaving him no way of finding her. One morning, a short time later, we become aware that a group of men, all wearing hats, seem to be taking a strange interest in Norris. One of them, who goes by the name of Harry (Anthony Mackie), has been given the strange assignment of making sure Norris spills his coffee on himself by 7:05AM. Things, however, do not go as planned, and as a result, two things happen: (1) Norris runs into Elise on the bus, this time getting her phone number, and (2) Norris inadvertently stumbles across the existence of the Men In Hats in the act of manipulating events in his life. And is told by them that he must never reveal what he has learned to anyone, and that he must never see Elise again because it's not part of their plan for him. And because seeing her will not only ruin their plans for him, it'll ruin the bright future they have planned for her as well.The cast is excellent and is a large part of what makes The Adjustment Bureau work. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt project a believable chemistry of two people who from the first moment know they were always meant to be together. John Slattery (best known from TV's Mad Men) is perfect as Richardson, the officious leader of the team of agents managing Norris' life. Terrence Stamp is marvelous as always as Thompson, the hard-nosed trouble shooter nicknamed ""The Hammer"" who is brought in when things really go awry. But it is Anthony Mackie who gives the movie a lot of its heart as Harry, the low-key agent with doubts about the plan. Mackie never raises his voice, never lets Harry's feelings show on his face, but conveys everything with his subtly expressive eyes.There are also a host of cameos of public figures from the political and media arenas, meant I suppose to make things more realistic, but in truth they're incidental, particularly in a film like this where a good deal of suspension of disbelief is necessary. Still, some people will have fun seeing how many they can spot. I counted at least eight.As enjoyable as The Adjustment Bureau is, it does require certain periodic suspensions of disbelief which I cannot dwell on without revealing certain parts of the plot. And while it does at least toy with questions of free-will vs predestined fate, in the end it is a romance story and does opt for the ending that most easily satisfies. It might have been a deeper, more complex movie if Nolfi had had Norris make a less conventional choice, either choosing to stay with the plan the Men In Hats have laid out for him, giving up love for career, or sacrificing his own chance at happiness so that Elise can have the grand career he knows is awaiting her.Anyone who has seen Stairway To Heaven will instinctively know how this all turns out. Highly recommended for anyone who loves a good love-conquers-all romance story set in a very different reality from the one we know.",4,A sci-fi romance that's one part Philip K.

And how will that be enforced?This brilliant movie starts by assuming an answer that second question: The Adjustment Bureau makes sure things turn out according to The Plan. David Norris (Matt Damon's outstandingly played character) encounters a dancer (portrayed beautifully by Emily Blunt), and mutual infatuation strikes in a heartbeat. Their affection is not part of The Plan, however. It must be stopped. Then, in an unrelated thread of the story, Norris discovers the Bureau's workings.Soon enough, they're working against him. This keeps a more credible tone than most action movies - no block-buster stunts, no guns, no explosions. Special effects appear in a very few places, neatly done but with a light touch that I appreciate. All that lets the raw characters come through, a Kafka-like sense of vast and unseen powers. Instead of submitting to the faceless forces, however, Damon and Blunt confront them.
