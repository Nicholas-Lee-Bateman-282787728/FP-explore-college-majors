There is a dryness to the jokes at times which is juxtaposed to the furious pace at which they are unflinchingly delivered. He is a master craftsman at the top of his game on this disc. Katt is unrelenting in his quest to make you vomit from laughter - and you will too if you are not careful. He is obviously well read and that is always a huge advantage for any comedian. His observational skills are on the money and his topics relevant. There isn't a dull moment with this guy on stage. The jokes are crisp and original; his style and presentation unique; his physical humour spellbinding - with great usage of facial expression and tonality. His pace varies from fast to hectic. There is nothing pimp-like (or distasteful) about this performance all the way through. I rate Katt very highly.I am eagerly awaiting the sequel.

I cracked up so hard when Katt started janking on Michael. Even to this day, I still bust out laughing. This is just a great stand-up comedy act.

He pulls laugh after laugh after laugh... It's hard to REVIEW comedians b/c everyone has a different take on what ""FUNNY"" is but I'll say this - if this KATT does not make you LAUGH - U are not ALIVE ON THE INSIDE!!! Cuz anyone who's breathing will find laughs in his comedy style and content... and PIMP-INSPIRED Style and Attitude!! Very much a man made to make others laugh and he blazes the show from BEGINNING TO END - NO FILLER JOKES!!! even the simplest things said by him, are 10 times as funny as they would be coming from someone else.... So - if U wanna gather around, w/some friends, have some drinks, chill and have a REAL GOOD time - A Night AIN'T a Nite without a Katt Williams Invite!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,THE HOTTEST MAN IN COMEDY,1162512000,"11 3, 2006",2006,875,"['KATT', 'lol', 'fire', 'HILLARIOUS', 'calm', 'demeanor', 'extremely', 'appealing', 'very', 'unique', 'comedy', 'style', 'EFFORTLESS', 'laugh', 'laugh', 'laugh', 'hard', 'REVIEW', 'comedians', 'b/c', 'everyone', 'different', 'take', 'what', 'FUNNY', ""'ll"", 'say', 'KATT', 'not', 'make', 'LAUGH', 'U', 'are', 'not', 'ALIVE', 'ON', 'THE', 'INSIDE', 'Cuz', 'anyone', 'who', 'breathing', 'will', 'find', 'laughs', 'comedy', 'style', 'content', 'PIMP-INSPIRED', 'Style', 'Attitude', 'Very', 'much', 'man', 'made', 'make', 'others', 'show', 'BEGINNING', 'TO', 'END', 'FILLER', 'JOKES', 'even', 'simplest', 'things', 'said', 'are', '10', 'times', 'as', 'funny', 'would', 'be', 'coming', 'someone', 'else', 'U', 'wan', 'gather', 'around', 'w/some', 'friends', 'have', 'drinks', 'chill', 'have', 'REAL', 'GOOD', 'time', 'Night', 'AI', ""N'T"", 'Nite', 'Katt', 'Williams', 'Invite']",Katt Williams - The Pimp Chronicles Part 1
