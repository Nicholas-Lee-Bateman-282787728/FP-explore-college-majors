(You can't have enough &#34;family friendly&#34; movies.)  However, even though the plot was weak the character developments were what really caught my eye.  I found that even the scenery (my heart is Irish) could not hold my attention.

Since it is filmed on the isle of Mann it has the dialect which sometimes could use subtitles but not often. This is one of the beautiful places of the United Kingdom that few ever visit and should for the scenery and peace.

Don't get me wrong - he's a nice guy and everything - but I think it was a mistake to pick him and not a native actor. The story is essentially a variation on the Old Yeller theme.

Wilson ""Author: Animal Movies Guide ...","[0, 0]","Nico:Bummed-out Billy (Kevin Zeggers) is the target of bullies because he has a permanent gimp; the injury was caused by a car accident that left him permanently disabled and killed his father. When Billy spots an abused pony at a traveling sideshow in town, he convinces his mother (Anne Archer) to let him buy the bony pony and rescue her from her ""bullies"". As it turns out, the mare is in-foal, and soon gives birth to Nico. Billy is convinced that the colt is a unicorn and although he tries to keep his special treasure a secret, his ruffian classmates soon get wind of the fantastical phenomenon and alerts the media. In an effort to protect Nico, Billy takes the magically-matured stallion into the forest, which, he finds is even more dangerous than the spotlight. Based on the book by Frank Sacks.Owd Bob:Taking place on the remote Isle of Man, Owd Bob follows the story of a hardhearted, embittered farmer (James Cromwell) who's feuding with his neighbor (Colm Meaney); each is determined to win the annual sheep-herding competition, but their chances are put into jeopardy when both men's dogs are suspected in a series of local sheep killings. This film is a remake of movies made in 1924 and 1938. Based on the book Owd Bob, Son of Battle by Alfred Ollivant.This seems like a rather strange pairing to me. The first movie, while it is fast-paced, is dumbed-down for kids. The second movie, while intelligent enough for almost anyone to enjoy, is incredibly slow-moving. The first one is pure fantasy, while the second one is realistic to the point of being mundane.Staci Layne Wilson",3,Two so-so movies for the price of one,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,1597,"['Nico', 'Bummed-out', 'Billy', 'Kevin', 'Zeggers', 'target', 'bullies', 'permanent', 'gimp', 'injury', 'was', 'caused', 'car', 'accident', 'left', 'permanently', 'disabled', 'killed', 'father', 'When', 'Billy', 'spots', 'abused', 'pony', 'traveling', 'sideshow', 'town', 'mother', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'let', 'buy', 'bony', 'pony', 'rescue', 'bullies', 'out', 'mare', 'in-foal', 'soon', 'birth', 'Nico', 'Billy', 'convinced', 'colt', 'unicorn', 'keep', 'special', 'treasure', 'secret', 'ruffian', 'classmates', 'soon', 'get', 'wind', 'fantastical', 'phenomenon', 'media', 'effort', 'protect', 'Nico', 'Billy', 'magically-matured', 'stallion', 'forest', 'even', 'more', 'dangerous', 'spotlight', 'Based', 'book', 'Frank', 'Sacks.Owd', 'Bob', 'Taking', 'place', 'remote', 'Isle', 'Man', 'Owd', 'Bob', 'story', 'hardhearted', 'embittered', 'farmer', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'who', 'feuding', 'neighbor', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'determined', 'win', 'annual', 'sheep-herding', 'competition', 'chances', 'are', 'put', 'jeopardy', 'when', 'men', 'dogs', 'are', 'suspected', 'series', 'local', 'sheep', 'killings', 'film', 'remake', 'movies', 'made', '1924', '1938', 'Based', 'book', 'Owd', 'Bob', 'Son', 'Battle', 'Alfred', 'Ollivant.This', 'rather', 'strange', 'pairing', 'first', 'movie', 'fast-paced', 'dumbed-down', 'kids', 'second', 'movie', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'almost', 'anyone', 'enjoy', 'incredibly', 'slow-moving', 'first', 'one', 'pure', 'fantasy', 'second', 'one', 'realistic', 'point', 'being', 'mundane.Staci', 'Layne', 'Wilson']",Nico the Unicorn/Owd Bob
