Schramm is a serial killer, at least he dreams of being one. Like many German horror movies, Schramm uses dreams and psychological character studies to create a world unto itself. The title character is dying, and his life, dream or real, is told to us through flashbacks--his desire to kill, his pain at being unable to feel something, anything, his plots of killings that will relieve the tension and pain that he experiences. The movie is extremely graphic, with one particular scene involving Schramm's genitals that could disturb the most hard-core horror fan, and be rather embarrassing to others. But Schramm is worth seeing, as a excellent character study and fascinating use of dream horror to take us deep inside the psyche of a very troubled man.

It has much going for it in the area of lensing and camera work.  The acting is well done.  One might wonder how a short one hour film could be so disturbing, but there are images here that ring more real than ""Faces of Death.""  Other reviewers have mentioned some spoilers, but I will only say that sometimes it seems that the cinematographer just happened upon some weird event that appeared in the film unplanned.  We just happened by to catch this fellow blowing his brains out.  Let's show the world. Looky! Looky!I must admit that there were scenes in this film that were really difficult to watch.  That has never happened to me except when I saw a film called ""Death Scenes.""  There were images that made me want to wash my mind out with soap.  Does anyone know what I mean?  Just try eating a sandwich and watching this film at the same time, I do not believe it can be done. The real question is does anyone really want this kind of thing floating around in their brain?

1017657,A284WUQS94AQ7A,B000HXDWO6,"Geri ""Birdie""","[2, 4]","This is October and I wanted to view some horror.  I like horror movies about serial killers, so after reading another review by my Amazon buddy, M., I bought this one.  This movie dealt more with the mind of the serial killer than to his haunting craft.  The character, Lothar was dubbed the ""lipstick killer"".  This film opens up as he is dying in a pool of his own blood and he has flashbacks on his life.  You saw how a serial killer begins with a mind that is twisted and demented.  Lothar even obsessess over a certain female whore, who was his neighbor.  This movie has a good amount of gore as Lothar did kill a couple of religious freaks that came to his door to sell religion.  But then, who hasn't had that thought when they come to your door, after you get home from a long day at work!  For all you gore hounds, this movie even has masochism as he maims himself with a hammer and a few nails on his private parts.  Interestingly enough, I read that they actually used a stunt person that really did pound nails into his private parts, ouch!  This film did hold my interest, although I kind of wanted more.  It is also subtitled, so you have to read quickly.  But, very, very entertaining.",4,I'll never be able to look at a hamer and nails the same way anymore ...,1191542400,"10 5, 2007",2007,1201,"['October', 'wanted', 'view', 'horror', 'like', 'horror', 'movies', 'serial', 'killers', 'so', 'reading', 'review', 'Amazon', 'buddy', 'M.', 'bought', 'one', 'movie', 'more', 'mind', 'serial', 'killer', 'haunting', 'craft', 'character', 'Lothar', 'was', 'dubbed', 'lipstick', 'killer', 'film', 'up', 'dying', 'pool', 'own', 'blood', 'flashbacks', 'life', 'saw', 'how', 'serial', 'killer', 'mind', 'twisted', 'demented', 'Lothar', 'even', 'obsessess', 'certain', 'female', 'whore', 'who', 'was', 'neighbor', 'movie', 'good', 'amount', 'gore', 'Lothar', 'did', 'kill', 'couple', 'religious', 'freaks', 'came', 'door', 'sell', 'religion', 'then', 'who', ""n't"", 'had', 'thought', 'when', 'come', 'door', 'get', 'home', 'long', 'day', 'work', 'gore', 'hounds', 'movie', 'even', 'masochism', 'hammer', 'few', 'nails', 'private', 'parts', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'read', 'actually', 'used', 'stunt', 'person', 'really', 'did', 'pound', 'nails', 'private', 'parts', 'ouch', 'film', 'did', 'hold', 'interest', 'kind', 'wanted', 'more', 'also', 'subtitled', 'have', 'read', 'quickly', 'very', 'very', 'entertaining']",Schramm

1017660,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000HXDWO6,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[17, 19]","""Schramm"" is a movie that got my attention in a video store, both with the cover and the back cover that exclaimed that it was similar to Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, one of my favorite horror films. If you've seen Henry, you realize that there's actually a pretty big restraint on blood and gore. It's existent, but it's not that bad. The movie used atmosphere and Michael Rooker's performance to creep you out. Schramm goes up another level on that. In Schramm you get a no holds barred look at the life of a serial killer... And it's all done in 64 minutes, which makes it kind of impressive. This movie also is probably the truest account of what goes on behind a serial killers' door. Movies about serial killers show that they kill and, sometimes, why. But few films show the really dirty things about serial killers. This film gives us the self-mutilation, necrophilia, and sexual deviancy. The movie is in German and I got to praise the Germans for making a movie like this. I don't think an American director would touch this kind of material with a ten-foot pole. And if he did, he'd tone it down a lot. I, regrettably, don't remember the main characters name...But I know this. The movie begins with a newspaper headline that explains that the Lipstick Killer has died. He is, of course, our aforementioned killer. The movie works its way back from that. The prostitute that lives across the hall from him, whom he's actually good friends with, sets something off in his head that makes him begin to kill. In the movie, the body count is pretty low...But this is still very gory. One scene which is bound to make men who watch this cringe, involve the guy taking his d**k and pounding nails through it. There's also one of the most interesting and unique ideas I've seen. A disembodied vag**a with teeth. The movie suffers from a disjointed timeline. The movie's about an insane serial killer...But the look of the movie implies it's about a schizophrenic serial killer. The grainy, old movieish look the film has, however, also helps with the creepiness. This is not a ""good"" movie, but it's effective and does something that other movies about serial killers should do (instead of crap like Dahmer, Ted Bundy, Gacy, etc.). If you want to see a movie that frequently has you asking yourself ""What the f**k?"" This is a good movie for you.GRADE: B-",4,"Vulgar, Disgusting, and Disturbing.",1163894400,"11 19, 2006",2006,2365,"['Schramm', 'movie', 'got', 'attention', 'video', 'store', 'cover', 'back', 'cover', 'exclaimed', 'was', 'similar', 'Henry', 'Portrait', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'one', 'favorite', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Henry', 'realize', 'actually', 'pretty', 'big', 'restraint', 'blood', 'gore', 'existent', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'used', 'atmosphere', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'performance', 'creep', 'out', 'Schramm', 'up', 'level', 'Schramm', 'get', 'barred', 'look', 'life', 'serial', 'killer', 'done', '64', 'minutes', 'kind', 'impressive', 'movie', 'also', 'probably', 'truest', 'account', 'what', 'serial', 'killers', 'door', 'Movies', 'serial', 'killers', 'show', 'kill', 'sometimes', 'why', 'few', 'films', 'show', 'really', 'dirty', 'things', 'serial', 'killers', 'film', 'self-mutilation', 'necrophilia', 'sexual', 'deviancy', 'movie', 'German', 'got', 'praise', 'Germans', 'making', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'American', 'director', 'would', 'touch', 'kind', 'material', 'ten-foot', 'pole', 'did', ""'d"", 'tone', 'down', 'lot', 'regrettably', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'main', 'characters', 'name', 'know', 'movie', 'newspaper', 'headline', 'Lipstick', 'Killer', 'died', 'course', 'aforementioned', 'killer', 'movie', 'way', 'back', 'prostitute', 'hall', 'whom', 'actually', 'good', 'friends', 'sets', 'something', 'off', 'head', 'begin', 'kill', 'movie', 'body', 'count', 'pretty', 'low', 'still', 'very', 'gory', 'One', 'scene', 'bound', 'make', 'men', 'who', 'watch', 'cringe', 'involve', 'guy', 'taking', 'd**k', 'pounding', 'nails', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'unique', 'ideas', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'disembodied', 'vag**a', 'teeth', 'movie', 'suffers', 'disjointed', 'timeline', 'movie', 'insane', 'serial', 'killer', 'look', 'movie', 'schizophrenic', 'serial', 'killer', 'grainy', 'old', 'movieish', 'look', 'film', 'however', 'also', 'creepiness', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'effective', 'something', 'other', 'movies', 'serial', 'killers', 'should', 'do', 'instead', 'crap', 'Dahmer', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'Gacy', 'etc.', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'frequently', 'asking', 'What', 'f**k', 'good', 'movie', 'you.GRADE', 'B-']",Schramm

1017664,A2GHH8L0APUT09,B000HXDWO6,"Tomas Rodriguez ""Orange Jester""","[2, 2]","This movie could have been amazing. It starts off very well then loses steam way too quickly. Even though it's relatively short, it still feels like it takes forever to get through. Don't be fooled by people telling you it's some kind of gory splatterfest either, it's not. There are maybe 2 gory scenes in the film, 3 tops if I recall correctly.This movie is about a serial killer named Lothar who is friends with a hooker who lives across the hall from him. He comes off as a nice guy who is easy to talk to, but obviously that is only a disguise. He asks her a lot of questions and listens to her having sex with men in her apartment. Part of him wants to protect her, the other loathes what she does.The beginning shows Lothar lying dead in a pool of his own blood, basically showing us the ending of the film. What follows is everything that led up to that moment. We see him killing some people who come into his home asking him about accepting Jesus into his life. He invites them in for a drink and them violently murders them.The problem is that we keep seeing scenes being repeated over and over again. In a movie that's barely over an hour, why do we need to be shown the same scenes 3 or 4 times? There are also long scenes of Lothar having sex with a doll and cleaning it out, as well as boring conversations between him and his neighbor.The main gruesome scene is where Lothar takes a bunch of nails and hammers them into his penis and scrotum. Supposedly, the actor did this for real, which truly is a disturbing thing to think about.Overall, this movie isn't very good. It's not the worst movie ever, but it's disappointing to see how the movie goes from being interesting to outright boring and tedious.
