T ""(b-_-)b""","[2, 4]","Watching the film adaptation of Denis Johnson's collection of short stories, Jesus' Son, is a lot like watching Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia. You sit there entertained by wonderful performances but you can't help but notice the story isn't all that great. The script is very clunky, feels a bit forced and loses much of charm of the source material, but thankfully, Billy Crudup's performance saves the film. Billy Crudup really shows his acting range in this film, portraying the hapless but lovable protagonist, &quot;F.H.&quot;. This episodic film is futher helped along by an all-star cast of cameo appearances by Dennis Leary, Will Patton, Holly Hunter, Dennis Hopper and the hilarious Jack Black.Stylistically, Alison Maclean does a decent job of transferring Jesus' Son to the screen. Personally, I felt the film wasn't visually dark enough in comparision to the book. But with most book to film adaptations, perceived accuracy tends to differ from person to person. Although there are some really interesting visual effects, Jesus' Son cinematically is quite plain.Overall, Jesus' Son is worth watching.

519568,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CWS6,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","I'm not really sure what to say here.Now, I have not read the short stories that inspired this film so I am not approaching this like a `Jesus' Son' loyalist.  I'm approaching this as a movie-goer who likes to formulate his own opinions and share them with the public.I expected to love this movie.  The reason for that is that, as a rule, I am all for this brand of self discovery and or character development.  I am far more interested in the human dynamic within film as apposed to a cut and dry plot I can follow.  So, the whole disjointed, vignette approach taken here was not a bother to me nor was it something I was wary about.  I was thrilled to see it being used and was really hoping to dive right into it.  Couple that with the fact that it stars Samantha Morton, who is like a goddess, and you have me waiting patiently on my couch for this experience to unveil itself.Alas, I was hugely disappointed.The film has no plot but instead merely follows around our nameless narrator as we dives in and out of relationships (well one real relationship and a few acquaintances) on a journey of semi-self discovery.  These are presented to us in a series of sequences that are supposed to reveal some deep meaningful existence here but instead prove to be somewhat empty and unnecessary.  Instead of feeling connected and or even interested in our protagonist, we find ourselves (or I should say that I found myself) completely detached and rather bored with him.  I could care less what he does or who he does it with because he means nothing to me.It doesn't help that Billy Crudup doesn't have the talent to convey this character properly.I recently (when speaking of `Angels and Insects' and Kristin Scott Thomas's flawless performance within it) told a friend that I hate recommending a bad film based on the sole performance by an actor or actress that they really should see.  That said, you really need to see what Samantha Morton does here.  She gives, easily, one of my favorite supporting performances of the decade.  There is such natural earnest honesty in her performance, and it is layered perfectly.  I could care less about our nameless narrator, but I wanted so badly to console and or understand Michelle.  Morton's portrayal of this ravaged soul was so heartfelt it pained me to see her wasted on this misguided film.I understand that this film is about drug use and that this film tries to portray the reality of it all, but it just doesn't really do that well.Like one reviewer stated (w/w); ""I thought about mermaids.""",2,I just didn't care enough...,1274140800,"05 18, 2010",2010,2546,"[""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'say', 'here.Now', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'short', 'stories', 'inspired', 'film', 'so', 'am', 'not', 'approaching', 'Jesus', 'Son', 'loyalist', ""'m"", 'approaching', 'movie-goer', 'who', 'formulate', 'own', 'opinions', 'share', 'public.I', 'expected', 'love', 'movie', 'reason', 'that', 'rule', 'am', 'brand', 'self', 'discovery', 'character', 'development', 'am', 'far', 'more', 'interested', 'human', 'dynamic', 'film', 'apposed', 'cut', 'dry', 'plot', 'can', 'follow', 'So', 'whole', 'disjointed', 'vignette', 'approach', 'taken', 'here', 'was', 'not', 'bother', 'was', 'something', 'was', 'wary', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'being', 'used', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'dive', 'right', 'Couple', 'fact', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'who', 'goddess', 'have', 'waiting', 'patiently', 'couch', 'experience', 'unveil', 'itself.Alas', 'was', 'hugely', 'disappointed.The', 'film', 'plot', 'instead', 'merely', 'around', 'nameless', 'narrator', 'dives', 'relationships', 'well', 'one', 'real', 'relationship', 'few', 'acquaintances', 'journey', 'semi-self', 'discovery', 'are', 'presented', 'series', 'sequences', 'are', 'supposed', 'reveal', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'existence', 'here', 'instead', 'prove', 'be', 'somewhat', 'empty', 'unnecessary', 'Instead', 'feeling', 'connected', 'even', 'interested', 'protagonist', 'find', 'should', 'say', 'found', 'completely', 'detached', 'rather', 'bored', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'what', 'who', 'nothing', 'me.It', ""n't"", 'help', 'Billy', 'Crudup', ""n't"", 'have', 'talent', 'convey', 'character', 'properly.I', 'recently', 'when', 'speaking', 'Angels', 'Insects', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'flawless', 'performance', 'told', 'friend', 'hate', 'recommending', 'bad', 'film', 'based', 'sole', 'performance', 'actor', 'actress', 'really', 'should', 'see', 'said', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'what', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'here', 'easily', 'one', 'favorite', 'supporting', 'performances', 'decade', 'such', 'natural', 'earnest', 'honesty', 'performance', 'layered', 'perfectly', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'nameless', 'narrator', 'wanted', 'so', 'badly', 'console', 'understand', 'Michelle', 'Morton', 'portrayal', 'ravaged', 'soul', 'was', 'so', 'heartfelt', 'pained', 'see', 'wasted', 'misguided', 'film.I', 'understand', 'film', 'drug', 'use', 'film', 'portray', 'reality', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'well.Like', 'one', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'w/w', 'thought', 'about', 'mermaids']",N/A

Okay, maybe snorefest is a bit harsh, but I will admit that I dozed off for a few minutes and definitely day-dreamed through at least a third of the film.  I'm all for movies that remain somewhat plotless but explore more or less human interaction, but `Jesus' Son' was one of those films that didn't explore much of anything.  Honestly if it weren't for Samantha Morton's wonderful performance I may have deemed this a pointless waste of my afternoon, but her performance alone made me happy to have at least sat through this once.  Billy Crudup was terrible here.  He has done much better in other films but here he just came off amateur.As the nameless narrator Crudup gives us sequences of events that try and tell us who he is as a person but fail miserably to do so.  We see him meet and fall in love with Michelle (Morton) and then watch them fail to clean up (their drug use).  We watch him pop pills with Georgie (Black in a scene stealing role) who works as an orderly at the hospital our hero (should I call him that) works in.  We see him kill some baby rabbits and peep on the Amish woman who lives near him.  The problem is that none of these scenes, none of these events really establish any ground or make us care one bit for our narrator (well, I say `us' but I mean `me'...they didn't make me care about him at all).

And it's not the drug part that irritates me, it's the slacker part.  This movie is the adventures of a guy in the early 70's who basically just drifts.  He encounters girls, drugs, a stab at a family life, more drugs, rehab, more girls, and well, you watch it and tell me.  I'd say a fair assumption of a movie is that while you don't have to care FOR the characters in it, you should at least care what happens to him.  ""Bugsy"" may not have been a good guy, but you did want to see how that movie ended.With this movie, there is no such caring.  The character is not a bad guy.  He's fairly friendly an amiable.  But to tell you the truth, I'd rather have Bugsy over for dinner in the presence of my children than the hero of this movie.  At least Bugsy had drive and ambition, which can be channeled positively.

I recall being actually kind of  angry at all these small town stoners whose only countercultural value was, quite frankly, drug taking.  Society was not about to undergo a profound spiritual transformation at their hands.  Of course, it was scarcely about to at anyone else's either...but who knew back then?Lost souls like JESUS SON'S &quot;FH&quot; were really not uncommon back in the day. They may not have been uncommon back in any day.  But the 60s and early 70s brand was perhaps a little more noticeable and, in some senses, sympathetic because of their vaguely anti-establishment stance.  For a brief moment in history, outcasts were almost taken seriously.  These people really did exist. As surreal as JESUS' SON sometimes gets, it remains grounded in its very vivid, very authentic characters.Yes, there were certain junkie truths that ultimately became cinematic cliches.  The numrerous OD's, the failed love relationships and the sporadic attempts at redemption are all elements of JESUS' SON.  And yet, they come across as less cliched in this particular druggie film than in some others.  Perhaps it's because the acting is almost uniformly excellent--with leads, Billy Crudup and Samantha Morton, deserving of particular praise.  Perhaps too it's, at least in part, because FH's ultimate redemption is a plausible one.  Out of rehab, he gets a job in a different kind of rehabilitation center, a home for sufferers of rare neurological diseases.  It is finally there that he realizes that there may indeed be a place in the world for people like him.Many viewers will find the final, sobered up segment of the film a little weaker dramatically than the drug addled scenes that precede it.  That's true, but the end is also something of a relief.  FH would surely have joined the ranks of his fallen comrades in arms had it not been for rehab and the chance at a new life in a new city.  It's the kind of ending you could call &quot;bittersweet&quot;--if you use terminology like that.  It's also one of only two possible endings for someone like &quot;FH&quot;--and, like him, you're grateful for that much.When I first heard of this movie, I immediately recognized the source of the title as being a line from Lou Reed's &quot;Heroin.&quot;  I was disappointed, at first, to see that that song was not incluced on the soundtrack.  But on further reflection, that actually seemed the better choice. Lou Reed is the quintessetial urban poet.  FH never even comes close to New York City or any other real metropolis.

His one huge problem is that everything in his life before drug rehab revolves around the narcotics he's so earnestly trying to flee from. The result is a journey - spiritual and psychological - where the young man begins to see life for what it really is: simple beauty, and finds himself taking pleasure in listening to a woman singing each day as he walks from work and the insane patients he works with.Fluent all throughout this film, characters that we encounter are there for a reason and in some ways, each newfound character is like another individual in our anti-heroe's own personal odyssey.Jack Black, Denis Leary, Dennis Hopper, Holly Hunter and Will Patton(Mothman Prophecies, Armageddon) also make notable apperances.One of my top ten indy films, Jesus' Son lacks the sacrilegious tones that many might envision it possesses.

Just as ""Trainspotting"" was often described as a ""Drugstore Cowboy for the 1990s,"" it's tempting to describe ""Jesus' Son"" as a ""Drugstore Cowboy for the 2000s"".Like Gus Van Sant's now-classic film, the story revolves around two heroin addicts (Billy Crudup and Samantha Morton, both excellent), it's set in the past (the 1970s instead of the 1960s), and it's based on a pre-existing literary source, in this case, Denis Johnson's story collection of the same name. But despite everything--mostly bad--that F@#khead (Crudup) experiences throughout the course of the film, ""Jesus' Son"" is more of a character study (FH, as he's known, also serves as narrator).Like Portland's Gus Van Sant, New Zealand's Alison MacLean refrains from judging her characters. But ""Jesus' Son"" isn't as concerned with FH's drug use as much as his very character, his nature--his essence, if you will. And if you can't find anything to like about the hapless FH, you'll probably feel the same way about MacLean's darkly comic film (after the well received, but little-seen ""Crush"").As in ""High Fidelity,"" Jack Black provides much of the humor, although Crudup proves adept at a few choice moments. The film also features Dennis Hopper, Denis Leary, and Holly Hunter (in a well acted, but not particularly convincing role). Fans of ""The Panic in Needle Park"" (starring Al Pacino in his first lead performance), Vincent Gallo's loopy ""Buffalo 66,"" and especially--yes--""Drugstore Cowboy"" will find much to enjoy.Joe Henry's fine soundtrack only serves to sweeten the deal, the highlight of which must surely be Tommy Roe's funky ""Sweet Pea"", to which Morton's Michelle does *quite* the dance, drawing FH into her dangerously druggy world without saying a word. And speaking of music, the Velvet Underground's ""Heroin"", in which Lou Reed claims he feels ""just like Jesus' Son"" when he's ""rushing on [his] run,"" is conspicuous by its absence.

519580,A270XXONKJ2BAU,B00003CWS6,mackjay,"[7, 10]","Although it is far from perfect, ""Jesus' Son"" stands as a shining example of what is to be valued in independent filmmaking. It's impossible to imagine this film being produced in Hollywood. The subject matter is thorny, the form is innovative and most characters are ambiguous. In short, there's little here for a mass audience can grab onto. Yet, anyone choosing to pass this little film by will be missing something worthwhile.""Jesus' Son"", which takes its title from a Lou Reed song, expresses itself as a narrative memory. The film has the feel of random pages read out of someone's diary. It opens with a voice-over and we are immediately aware of an eccentric approach: the narrator has jumped the gun and needs to start over again. This sort of starting and re-starting may seem an affectation derived from the French 'new wave,' but it is handled so effectively that it succeeds in pulling the viewer into the film. Once officially on track, ""Jesus' Son"" moves from scene to scene with a method that seems wholly controlled by this main character/narrator, a young man known simply as F--head. We're never sure if he deserves this unflattering name, since his intentions are not always clear. F--head just seems to move through life, going where circumstances take him. Along the route, a wide variety of character types are encountered. Most leave F--head with something, and a few take something from him.For individuals who are roughly contemporary with the characters in this film, there is much here that rings true. The time period-early 1970s-was a strange, directionless time for many in their early twenties. In fact, the film almost makes an unintentional case for the rampant drug abuse of the time: for so many, there was nothing else to do.But the intention of ""Jesus' Son"" is not to excuse drug abuse, nor is to preach against it. Rather, the movie takes its hero on a rambling journey through the undersides and back alleys of life so that he may discover a single reason for staying alive. F--head seems a variant of the ""wise fool"" character, bringing about change in the lives of those he meets, yet seemingly unable to evaluate any of the events or relationships in his own life. Some viewers may see the hero guided by a higher power, of which he is himself unaware.While the film's haphazard structure may be annoying to some, it admirably suits the time period and life-styles of the characters. There is a seeming discrepancy between several scenes. Some have a realistic, semi-documentary feel (when F--head first encounters Michelle), while others appear to be drawn from some bizarre cable-TV sitcom (the entire hospital orderly sequence, for instance). As in many independent films of recent years, there is much humor mixed with stark drama. The director, Alison Maclean, keeps a firm grip, maneuvering between wide-ranging emotional states. In the end, one is left with the feeling of having really experienced something. This is due not only to Maclean, but to the very fine cast.Not surprisingly, ""Jesus' Son"" is dependent for its success on the portrayal of its central character. Billy Crudup, an actor who could easily be dismissed as a pretty boy, brings an almost palpable reality to every scene. He exhibits a total identification with the character and is able to project perfectly the inherent ambiguity that drives the entire story. Is F--Head putting everyone on? There are flashes of nearly poetic brilliance in his dialogue, mixed with befuddled inanity. He seems to live around his world, rather than within it; observing, but not always participating. Although one might wonder how someone with his lifestyle could have such perfect teeth, F--head as played by Crudup, is a beautiful, confused and confusing angel.Other cast members are memorable as well. Samantha Morton, who made a huge impression in Woody Allen's ""Sweet and Lowdown"", embodies the equally ambiguous persona of Michelle, who loves F--head, yet seeks to destroy herself. Dennis Leary effectively creates a man annihilated by his own life. The growing number of Jack Black fans will probably enjoy his over-the-top characterization, but to this viewer his George seems vaguely disturbing and threatening. Holly Hunter is the kind of performer who can bring a lot to a film with just a few lines. She plays a lovely crippled woman here with dignity and humor. Also excellent in their brief appearances are an understated Dennis Hopper and the vigorous Will Patton.Typical of many period films dealing with young people , the soundtrack of ""Jesus' Son"" is loaded with contemporary popular songs. But the choices here seem carefully made. There is new material as well: a fine main theme written by Bob Dylan and the closing credits are supported by a superb song with a Woody Guthrie lyric, set to music and performed by Wilco.",4,A

Denis Johnson's stupefyingly splendiferous collection of short stories, Jesus' Son, is I think writing of the first type. It seems a shame then that Alison Maclean and her team of scriptwriters didn't bear this distinction in mind before attempting to turn these incandescent stories--or parts of them at any rate--into a motion picture. Effhead, the unforgettably soulful and yearning junkie narrator of the book's eleven stories, is here drained of all humour, mystery and depth, neutered in fact, carelessly and even dismisively rendered as no more than some kind of dissolute young simpleton. Sigh. Overall I'd have to say that Maclean's movie made me want to throw darts at the screen but there are actually three good, if minor, reasons to watch this otherwise craptacular adaptation: the brief glimpse you get of Johnson himself playing the hapless dude who walks into the hospital emergency room with the knife sticking out of his eye, the character acting of a surprisingly strong Denis Leary in the section dealing with the story Work, and the part where the great Dennis Hopper is being ""interviewed"" while getting a shave and a haircut. That's two Denises and one Dennis and despite some laudatory palaver about Samantha Morton's overly-indulged performance--overly-indulged I might add by both Morton herself AND the female filmmaker--these three Ds were the slender and only hooks for me.

And I have yet to see a Jack Black movie that didn't make me want to claw my eyes out. So what on Earth possessed me to think that there would be any chance at all that I'd like Alison MacLean's Jesus' Son, which features all three of them, along with a host of cameos (most of which, actually, are from actors well worth watching)? I'm not sure, but I should have known better.Crudup plays [censored] (yes, that's the name we know him by the movie), who gets involved with Michelle (Morton), and the story (using the term loosely) follows the two of them through the ups and downs of their relationship. Neither is a very likeable character; in fact, the both of them are rather disgusting throughout. Michelle gets [him] involved with drugs, and, since that's the way it absolutely must happen in Hollywood, [he] gets hooked and immediately begins a life of crime, then the two try to clean up their act when Michelle becomes pregnant, then we finally circle back to the opening scene, where [he] is hitchhiking his way across the country to track down a lead on Michelle... yeah, it's kind of complicated, more so because it's told in impressionist fashion. Minor characters come and go from the script with nary a wave or a nod; we're simply on to the next story. The end, I assume, is supposed to be an ambiguous attempt at redemption, but by the time we've gone through two hours of being around these rather braindead characters, can we trust anyone?

He was so misused in Saving Silverman. That said, let me go ahead and talk about the movie. Jesus' Son is offbeat and different. It's told slightly out of order which may throw some people. The out of order telling is used to reflect both F***Head's way of thinking and his life. It is narrated by the main character F***Head whose real name we never do find out. The narrating keeps you in touch with F***Head and really helps to make him likable. You can see that he's not a mean person, only a screwup. This is a dark movie interspersed with moments of humor after which reality usually comes crashing back down. It's a lot like a drug trip itself. For a drug addicted loser, F***Head comes off as a very likable character. The movie is basically the story of F***Head's search for what is missing in his life, what his soul is craving. He spent many years looking for it in drugs, but the highs from the drugs were only temporary. Finally he moves on and starts taking control of his life little by little. Billy Crudup does a great job in this roll making such a pathetic character likable. Also look for Denis's Leary and Hopper as well as Holly Hunter.DVD Quality: Widescreen anamorphic - 2.35:1, DD2.0 The trailer is the only extra. The picture quality is ok. The sound is DD2.0 but this isn't a movie that needs great sound.What You Should Do:  Check this out if you can handle the offbeat and different. There is a lot of drug use so steer clear if you don't like that. This is not a movie that hits you over the head with a message. You will have to get that out of it by yourself.Related Movies To Check Out: Drugstore Cowboy, Sid and Nancy, Traffic, Outside Providence",4,I Knew Every Raindrop By Name,1000080000,"09 10, 2001",2001,2140,"['Movie', 'Summary', 'F***Head', 'fool', 'drug', 'addict', 'who', 'life', 'happen', 'day', 'day', 'interested', 'only', 'getting', 'next', 'fix', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'likable', 'guy', 'friends', 'prove', 'story', 'how', 'F***Head', 'live', 'life', 'not', 'just', 'let', 'happen', 'him.My', 'Opinion', 'Jack', 'Black', 'awesome', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'performance', 'was', 'so', 'misused', 'Saving', 'Silverman', 'said', 'let', 'go', 'ahead', 'talk', 'movie', 'Jesus', 'Son', 'offbeat', 'different', 'told', 'slightly', 'order', 'may', 'throw', 'people', 'out', 'order', 'telling', 'used', 'reflect', 'F***Head', 'way', 'thinking', 'life', 'narrated', 'main', 'character', 'F***Head', 'real', 'name', 'never', 'do', 'find', 'out', 'narrating', 'keeps', 'touch', 'F***Head', 'really', 'make', 'likable', 'can', 'see', 'not', 'mean', 'person', 'only', 'screwup', 'dark', 'movie', 'interspersed', 'moments', 'humor', 'reality', 'usually', 'crashing', 'back', 'down', 'lot', 'drug', 'trip', 'drug', 'addicted', 'loser', 'F***Head', 'off', 'very', 'likable', 'character', 'movie', 'basically', 'story', 'F***Head', 'search', 'what', 'missing', 'life', 'what', 'soul', 'craving', 'spent', 'many', 'years', 'looking', 'drugs', 'highs', 'drugs', 'were', 'only', 'temporary', 'Finally', 'taking', 'control', 'life', 'little', 'little', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'great', 'job', 'roll', 'making', 'pathetic', 'character', 'likable', 'Also', 'look', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'Hopper', 'as', 'well', 'Holly', 'Hunter.DVD', 'Quality', 'Widescreen', 'anamorphic', '2.35:1', 'DD2.0', 'trailer', 'only', 'extra', 'picture', 'quality', 'ok', 'sound', 'DD2.0', ""n't"", 'movie', 'great', 'Should', 'Do', 'Check', 'out', 'can', 'handle', 'offbeat', 'different', 'lot', 'drug', 'use', 'steer', 'clear', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'not', 'movie', 'head', 'message', 'will', 'have', 'get', 'yourself.Related', 'Movies', 'Check', 'Out', 'Drugstore', 'Cowboy', 'Sid', 'Nancy', 'Traffic', 'Outside', 'Providence']",N/A

The movie should have been more shorts with different characters. The flow of it makes you lose characters you grow accustomed to, the drugged out hospital orderly, the AA woman etc, even the Amish women he is involved with in his own way doesn't really evolve the way it should. There are many classic and memorable scenes to enjoy. The ER scene where the two characters get wacked on hospital drugs then have to deal with an emergency is extremely well done.

This is one of the main ideas  of Jesus' Son.  The main character, FH, stumbles through life while many of  his friends die, yet he remains unharmed and only gradually begins to  change his ways.  This movie may be about death and pain, but it is  optimistic and hopeful; as long as life continues, something good can  happen.  There is a surprising amount of humor in the film, all of it  compassionate, it doesn't result to mocking the characters or the  situations as so many movies these days do.Some people have complained  that Jesus' Son imitates Pulp Fiction in its narrative.  This is untrue -  the story unfolds as FH tells it, sometimes he doubles back to give more  detail or fill in gaps, but for the most part it is linear.  FH's narration  gives the movie much of its personality.The acting is astoundingly  realistic throughout.  Of all the movies I've seen this year, Billy  Crudup's performance is the best.  Hopefully he will soon achieve the  widespread recognition he deserves.  The entire cast performs admirably,  every actor gets at least one scene to shine, with Crudup providing the  link from one to the next.  My favorite scene was Dennis Hopper's - his  final line speaks volumes about life and death and the human condition.The direction is self assured and impressive.  There is not much self  conscious camera trickery, and when it is used, it is to good effect.  The  soundtrack is another stong point, all of the songs enhance the mood of the  scene perfectly.Jesus' Son reminds me of last year's Bringing Out the  Dead in the way it subtly reveals so much about the nature of redemption  and the beauty that can be found in life if you just allow yourself to see  it.

Crudup and Morton are each great (as usual).  In what seems to be becoming par, Jack Black brings another eccentic, hillarious character to life.  Denis Leary gives a suprisingly good performance, definitely among his best.
