I am an Army veteran who spent time in Germany and I am also a serious collector of vintage wworld war 2 medals and my collection is vast containing very rare decorations from the Germans and Russians. Veterans of the Army who I spoke to back in 1993 when I was in Germany told me of the killings that men in their unit took part in. They also showed me black and white photo's of Army troops executing civilians and also posing with the bodies. They sometimes also assisted the S.S. in getting Jews or slave laborers on the trains. The subject was very hush hush when I was in Germany but it has since come to light. There were too many soldiers from too many units who got involved. I became friends with a former member of the S.S, mountain infantry regiment Nord who fought the Russians near the artic circle. Read the book Black Edelweiss by former S.S. Nord mountain trooper who speaks about both combat and conscience and that even though they had fierce fights with the Russians in northern Karelia and the Vosges Mountains, he never witnessed one instance of atrocity between the German and the Russians, I am well versed in the S.S. units and Nord has not be put in the category such as Das Reich or totenkof. It's time for people to accept the truths that the Army was also responsible for killings. I make a point to acknowledge the soldier who fought hard for his comrades even when he knew the war was lost, but was no a part of any atrocities. The subject matter is delicate but must be told.",5,Refreshing,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,1653,"['found', 'be', 'refreshing', 'years', 'many', 'speak', 'was', 'only', 'S.S.', 'einsatzgruppen', 'who', 'did', 'bulk', 'atrocities', 'am', 'Army', 'veteran', 'who', 'spent', 'time', 'Germany', 'am', 'also', 'serious', 'collector', 'vintage', 'wworld', 'war', '2', 'medals', 'collection', 'vast', 'containing', 'very', 'rare', 'decorations', 'Germans', 'Russians', 'Veterans', 'Army', 'who', 'spoke', 'back', '1993', 'when', 'was', 'Germany', 'told', 'killings', 'men', 'unit', 'took', 'part', 'also', 'showed', 'black', 'white', 'photo', 'Army', 'troops', 'executing', 'civilians', 'also', 'posing', 'bodies', 'sometimes', 'also', 'assisted', 'S.S.', 'getting', 'Jews', 'slave', 'laborers', 'trains', 'subject', 'was', 'very', 'hush', 'hush', 'when', 'was', 'Germany', 'come', 'light', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'soldiers', 'too', 'many', 'units', 'who', 'got', 'involved', 'became', 'friends', 'former', 'member', 'S.S', 'mountain', 'infantry', 'regiment', 'Nord', 'who', 'fought', 'Russians', 'artic', 'circle', 'Read', 'book', 'Black', 'Edelweiss', 'former', 'S.S.', 'Nord', 'mountain', 'trooper', 'who', 'combat', 'conscience', 'even', 'had', 'fierce', 'fights', 'Russians', 'northern', 'Karelia', 'Vosges', 'Mountains', 'never', 'witnessed', 'one', 'instance', 'atrocity', 'German', 'Russians', 'am', 'well', 'versed', 'S.S.', 'units', 'Nord', 'not', 'be', 'put', 'category', 'such', 'Das', 'Reich', 'totenkof', 'time', 'people', 'accept', 'truths', 'Army', 'was', 'also', 'responsible', 'killings', 'make', 'point', 'acknowledge', 'soldier', 'who', 'fought', 'hard', 'comrades', 'even', 'when', 'knew', 'war', 'was', 'lost', 'was', 'part', 'atrocities', 'subject', 'matter', 'delicate', 'must', 'be', 'told']",The Unknown Soldier

It was very much in favor of the documentary and against any one who complained about it. As for me . . . Give it a rest already!

The Israelis? &lt;snicker>German leftists may enjoy rubbing their countrymen's noses in the feces (while simultaneously ignoring or excusing the crimes of the Communists in East Germany) but I don't see the point, especially when it's been done so many times by so many people.

The translation captions can be tedious for some and an understanding of the Germany language allows for the slight nuisances in translation.

For those familiar with the topic, there is only a different point of view and perhaps a better understanding.Definitely recommended for those with an interest in human behavior or the ideological factors that allowed for the Holocaust.

1128156,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B0010YSDB8,J from NY,"[14, 20]","Until the full extent of German complicity--civilians and soldiers included--in the atrocities of WWII are revealed this nation will never be free from the considerable shame wrought by this time period.  We should keep in mind too, though, that there were German resistance fighters and that most attempts on Adolf Hitler's life were committed by German citizens/military.""The Unknown Soldier"" is a particularly disheartening documentary on the 1995 Wehrmacht exhibition that took place in Vienna (and opens periodically every year those who care to take a look) which reveals pretty clearly that all members of the German army were either aware of or took part in the atrocities and mass shootings of civilians usually relegated to the SS or the Gestapo.The obvious place of the Holocaust in the German psyche is shown very clearly as people outside the exhibition shove each other around, scream, and passionately debate about the accuracy or non-accuracy of the material presented in the exhibition. At one point a group of nearly toothless skinheads and right wing nutcases show up flying the Iron Cross and insisting that the whole thing is nonsense and that ""the press lies"".Not so, it seems.  Four German historians, sensitive to the subject matter, uncover photographs of ordinary German soldiers standing next to executed jews (one photograph of a three year old jewish girl hanging is vomit worthy) and make it fairly clear that all German soldiers, Wehrmacht included, were given explicit instructions that they carried around on the Eastern front to shoot any of the ""rabble"" they encountered.  An aging member of the Wehrmacht admits very frankly that Hitler's ""Mein Kampf"" captivated him for a time, and that he witnessed more than a few atrocities committed by the army. He also says very clearly that is ashamed of what he did and witnessed, and seems sincere.What has long been suppressed is that German soldiers *were not* executed for refusing to participate in these atrocities; they were disciplined or were asked to work in different capacities.  This has long been known by historians but has never been given as explicit treatment as in this documentary.  And some Germans did just that; dropped out of the army entirely once that they saw what was going on.This is not about all Germans being monsters.  Very soon this entire generation will die off and I think Germany should be commended for being so conscientious of these things, unlike some other nations who did very similar things and have never apologized once.  This is depressing and I would not watch it again, but is very important.

1128157,A68QXK0H88J4I,B0010YSDB8,matt,"[7, 12]","Please read the product description and then read this, as I won't repeat the basic premise of the film. As someone with ties to Bavaria and a general interest in World War Two, this one jumped out at me from the library shelf. It seeks to address the culpability of the average German foot soldier regarding the war crimes that have made the War a low point in the annals of history. After watching it, however, I am left feeling a little less than ambivalent over it, thinking that it doesn't do justice to two aspects that is should have addressed.First, the complicated thing we all possess called human nature, if there is even a human nature that we share, has obeyed more commands to do evil out of a herd instinct to obey than it has out of anger, religion or anything else. That is something that has been demonstrated time and again, famously by Milgrim in his shock study and Zimbardo in the Stanford Prison study, among many others. Humans will do almost anything to conform to herd expectations or the expectations of authority figures, even the greatest evils. This is a point that the director should have made strongly, showing it is not something unique to a certain type of German person to do wrong. It is universal. You and I would most likely not be the heroic resister, but the acquiescing accomplice. Face it; statistically it is true. Had that point been made, and it could have been, then we could have moved beyond the emotionalism of both sides that is a main feature of the film.Second, while I have absolutely no sympathy for those who committed such atrocities, it is simply ridiculous, and offensive, to paint with such a large brush so as to implicate all of the German soldiers. Why end there? Why not all the German people?  Again, the evils done by such a large amount of Germans, and German soldiers in particular, must never be forgotten. However, assigning blame in such a swath is irresponsible, especially given the nature of the topic.So in the end I feel that the exhibition is important and needed, but how you handle the documents, photos, testimonies needs to be more nuanced to be accurate and responsible.
