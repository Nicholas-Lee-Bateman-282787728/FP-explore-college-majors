1238885,AIA5PLISC0V8F,B001UIXZVW,Carlos,"[4, 14]",Partial review: I just saw the first 20 mins of this and noticed the Germans called the Russian tanks 'panzers.'  Is it just me or weren't the German tanks called panthers(panzer) or tigers(tiger) and the Russina tanks called T-54 or T-74(I may be off on the numbers)?  It just kind left me a little baffled.  It started good though.  I'll finish my review once I finish wataching it this weekend.  I just had to get that off my chest.,2,Panzers or T-54s?,1244160000,"06 5, 2009",2009,435,"['Partial', 'review', 'just', 'saw', 'first', '20', 'mins', 'noticed', 'Germans', 'called', 'Russian', 'tanks', ""'panzers"", 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'German', 'tanks', 'called', 'panthers', 'panzer', 'tigers', 'tiger', 'Russina', 'tanks', 'called', 'T-54', 'T-74', 'may', 'be', 'off', 'numbers', 'just', 'kind', 'left', 'little', 'baffled', 'started', 'good', ""'ll"", 'finish', 'review', 'once', 'finish', 'wataching', 'weekend', 'just', 'had', 'get', 'off', 'chest']",Brother's War

This movie takes the other route of focusing more on character than military situations.

1238887,A2K6VDHSE2NU4R,B001UIXZVW,Nachtjager,"[3, 6]","Again, PLEASE take into consideration the movies other people are reviewing before judging whether or not their opinions on a war movie such as this are valid.  I am NOT associated with this movie in ANY way, but it has gotten a VERY bad wrap here in the ratings department.  For pity's sake, the highest ranked reviewer here, who only gave this film two stars, has hundreds of reviews on everything from Snuggies to Pencil boxes, and he gave ""Rango"" - the animated Johnny Depp lizard movie, five-stars and called that thing a masterpiece.  I am a military history enthusiast, and if you are, you WILL like this movie.  If you're not, then you will not like this movie - it's quite simple.The reason there are so many bad reviews here is easily explained - this isn't Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers, it's a low-budget independent movie filmed in Michigan and California.  For the money they had to work with, I think they did a VERY good job and I was really surprised with what I saw.  Most of the cast in this movie are WWII reenactors, so they're not professional actors.  That being said, I think they actually did a better job than the ""actors"" who play most of the main characters.  Because the movie relies heavily on reenactors, the equipment and uniforms used are spot-on and very impressive.  You'll see G-43s, MP-44s, MG42s, PPSH's and they make good use of a nicely restored Hetzer, a Kettengrad, a Pak 75/40, at least one (maybe two) T-34/85 tanks, several nicely rebuilt Chevy and Ford German trucks, and a lot of little details you don't see in most big budget films because Hollywood doesn't think about those things - but reenactors do.The plot is actually quite plausible - a British officer and a German officer, both Masons, seperately witness a Soviet war crime and are both being hunted by the Russians while they try to reach the western front.  Actually, I thought the idea behind the movie was very good.  Although it is hampered by the budget of the movie, the plot line here is probably better than that of Saving Private Ryan.  The pros of this one are simple; lots of great authentic hardware, lots of great weapons, and lots of nice vehicles.  Yes, the acting could be better, but I've seen much worse acting in many war movies that are considered timeless classics - the Audie Murphy story comes to mind right away.  That was a far worse movie in every category except the budget, but it's a ""classic"" and this movie is panned because the current bar on war movies has been raised very high.To the people complaining about weapons that aren't recoiling, please, learn something about weapons - this isn't a video game.  There is an 88mm cannon in the movie, and no, it doesn't recoil after firing.  News flash, an 88mm CANNOT recoil unless you actually fire a live shell out of it!  Likewise, the cannons on the T34s and Hetzer used in the movie do not recoil, but again, unless you actually fire a live round through that barrel, it's not going to recoil.  This has never been a problem in other movies so I don't know why it's suddenly an issue here.  Guns that are hydraulic don't recoil in Saving Private Ryan, or Band of Brothers, or The Pacific, or in any other major war epic I can think of, so why is it such an issue here?This isn't a bad movie - it isn't the greatest war movie ever, but it's not bad.  The biggest problem I had with it, honestly, was that the main German officer didn't even attempt to sound German and had a downright ""California"" accent.  To me, it was problematic that some of the Russians spoke with Russian accents and some didn't, and some of the Germans spoke with German accents and others didn't - how hard is it to fake an accent?  Also, as always, they felt it necessary to insert a superfluous lady into the cast as a love interest, which served no purpose and the movie would've been better off without that I think.  Over all, however, I would recommend this movie IF YOU ARE A WWII HISTORY BUFF.  If you are, you'll like the film, if you're blown away entertained by ""Rango,"" then you're probably not going to like it.",4,NOT a bad movie!

Average to horrible acting, a few pointless story lines, shaky cam style that ruins every battle scene, a music score that wrecks every other scene, multitudes of unfocused shots, a 5.1 sound that is mixed almost entirely wrong, rudimentary CGI, really fake hand to hand, artillery and high caliber rifles that had no recoil, and so on.Now the good. Got to see some nice footage of nearby California (subbed for Poland), got to see my favorite mutant biker from Weird Science play a Russian, and that covers it. It had some emotional moments to it, and I give them props for showing multi-national cooperation in times of escaping Russian bad guys (German, Brit and whatever the gal was trying to be).Special features: A multi-page screen text about the Freemasons. Putting aside the bad grammar and poor spelling, it contained some sad facts about their organization during the war. Also included is a nine-minute making-of showing the production team and extras doing their thing. Has some informative material on the props and rehearsals.I give this two stars for the film and extras.
