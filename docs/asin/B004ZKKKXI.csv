1434840,A13JPNQI7WEQ7C,B004ZKKKXI,A. Snyder,"[34, 35]","When it comes to schlocky, low budget ""Conan the Barbarian"" knock-offs none has a worse reputation than the ""Deathstalker"" tetralogy. Despite the entire series being completely inept and the lowest common denominator when it comes to filmmaking, it still has a small legion of cult fans... me included. These are just campy delights with unlikeable barbaric anti-heroes, buxom heroines that bare it all and shoddy effects. Basically the series is a B-movie fanatics dream come true.Included in this quadruple feature, released though Shout Factory's wonderful 'Roger Corman Cult Classics' line, are the first two entries into the series. Both were previously released on DVD in Full Screen versions from the now defunct company New Concorde. These OOP releases were going for tons of money from secondary sellers and now we fans can get these films in this wonderful bargain set which contains both films in brand new anamorphic widescreen transfers! Thankfully the hilarious and insightful audio commentary for ""Deathstalker II: Duel of the Titans"" (seriously one of the most entertaining commentaries I have ever heard) from the previous DVD release is included. To top it off a brand new audio commentary is included for the first ""Deathstalker"" film!About a year ago Shout Factory released a double feature of ""Barbarian Queen"" and ""The  Warrior and the Sorceress"" that was exclusively sold on their website, no doubt because they thought there wasn't a big enough fan base to warrant a wide release. As a bonus they throw this disc in with the first two ""Deathstalker"" films. Both are only anamorphic widescreen transfers and are far better than the previous out-of-print New Concorde releases.This is a highly enjoyable collection of delightfully awful and campy sword & sorcery flicks but I had to deduct the release to a four star rating for one mistake. The mistake is that Shout Factory should have released two volumes of quadruple sword & sorcery features with the first containing all four ""Deathstalker"" films. Seriously why didn't they put all four ""Deathstalker"" films into one collection? Yes parts 3 & 4 are by far the worst but it would have been great to have all four in one collection (Part III has never even been given an official DVD release in America). The second volume should have contained ""Barbarian Queen I & II"", ""The Warrior and the Sorceress"" and ""Amazons"". This makes me worry that ""Deathstalker III & IV"", ""Barbarian Queen II"" and ""Amazons"" won't get another DVD release but I can keep my fingers crossed.... hopefully this set sells well to prove to Shout Factory that there are fans of these silly S&S; films.For people who want to complete their ""Deathstalker"" and ""Barbarian Queen"" franchises, you can still purchase the old out-of-print New Concorde releases of ""Deathstalker 4"" and ""Barbarian Queen 2 - The Empress Strikes Back"".

1434843,A3D1W9DU4XB30Q,B004ZKKKXI,Bobby,"[0, 0]","Tbh this isn't my genre of choice, but I heard some good things about the Deathstalker films, so I decided to give the set a try, and I'm glad I did. Even though none of these films are masterpieces, they're really entertaining, and fans of this stuff will eat it up.The set comes with 4 films.The first two films on the set are the first two Deathstalker films, and they're easily the best two films on the set. The first Deathstalker is much more serious than the second film, but it isn't quite as good as it's tongue in cheek sequel either. Rick Hill was a bit stiff as the lead, and the film may've took itself a bit too serious, but it's still a good time. It's never boring, and one of my favorite parts was seeing Richard Brooker (Friday the 13th Part 3) without his Jason attire. Overrall it's action packed fun.Deathstalker II was my absolute favorite film of the set though, and a complete blast from start to finish. The cast is clearly having the time of their lives, and it's equally as fun to watch for the viewers. John Terlesky and Monique Gabrielle are as charming as they are attractive, and the film is chock full of action and humor. Deathstalker II is a real winner.Sadly Deathstalker 3 and 4 are not included in this set, but hopefully we'll get a good release for them sometime in the future.The third and fourth films on the set aren't quite as strong or as memorable as the two Deathstalker films, but I thought they were a great addition to the set.The Barbarian Queen starred Lana Clarkson, and it was entertaining from start to finish, and The Warrior and the Sorceress starred David Carradine and was easily my least favorite film of the set. Not terrible or anything, but just not nearly as enjoyable as the others.All the films look pretty damn good, and it's great to see the Deathstalker films in widescreen.Both Deathstalker films come with a commentary. The first with the producer, director, effects artist, and Richard Brooker. The second with director Jim Wynorski, and actors John Terlesky and Toni Naples. The commentary for the second film is a must listen.The two films also come with their trailers.Overall Shout put together quite the good set. I may've not been of fan of this genre before I bought this, but I may be now!Worth a buy.",4,An enjoyable set of films,1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,2280,"['Tbh', ""n't"", 'genre', 'choice', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'Deathstalker', 'films', 'decided', 'give', 'set', 'try', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Even', 'none', 'films', 'are', 'masterpieces', ""'re"", 'really', 'entertaining', 'fans', 'stuff', 'will', 'eat', 'up.The', 'set', '4', 'films.The', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'set', 'are', 'first', 'two', 'Deathstalker', 'films', ""'re"", 'easily', 'best', 'two', 'films', 'set', 'first', 'Deathstalker', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'second', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'sequel', 'Rick', 'Hill', 'was', 'bit', 'stiff', 'lead', 'film', 'may', ""'ve"", 'took', 'bit', 'too', 'serious', 'still', 'good', 'time', 'never', 'boring', 'one', 'favorite', 'parts', 'was', 'seeing', 'Richard', 'Brooker', 'Friday', '13th', 'Part', '3', 'Jason', 'attire', 'Overrall', 'action', 'packed', 'fun.Deathstalker', 'II', 'was', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'film', 'set', 'complete', 'blast', 'start', 'finish', 'cast', 'clearly', 'having', 'time', 'lives', 'equally', 'as', 'fun', 'watch', 'viewers', 'John', 'Terlesky', 'Monique', 'Gabrielle', 'are', 'as', 'charming', 'are', 'attractive', 'film', 'chock', 'full', 'action', 'humor', 'Deathstalker', 'II', 'real', 'winner.Sadly', 'Deathstalker', '3', '4', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'set', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'get', 'good', 'release', 'sometime', 'future.The', 'third', 'fourth', 'films', 'set', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'strong', 'as', 'memorable', 'two', 'Deathstalker', 'films', 'thought', 'were', 'great', 'addition', 'set.The', 'Barbarian', 'Queen', 'starred', 'Lana', 'Clarkson', 'was', 'entertaining', 'start', 'finish', 'Warrior', 'Sorceress', 'starred', 'David', 'Carradine', 'was', 'easily', 'least', 'favorite', 'film', 'set', 'Not', 'terrible', 'anything', 'just', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'others.All', 'films', 'look', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good', 'great', 'see', 'Deathstalker', 'films', 'widescreen.Both', 'Deathstalker', 'films', 'come', 'commentary', 'first', 'producer', 'director', 'effects', 'artist', 'Richard', 'Brooker', 'second', 'director', 'Jim', 'Wynorski', 'actors', 'John', 'Terlesky', 'Toni', 'Naples', 'commentary', 'second', 'film', 'must', 'listen.The', 'two', 'films', 'also', 'come', 'trailers.Overall', 'Shout', 'put', 'together', 'quite', 'good', 'set', 'may', ""'ve"", 'not', 'been', 'fan', 'genre', 'bought', 'may', 'be', 'now', 'buy']","Roger Corman's Cult Classics Sword And Sorcery Collection (Deathstalker, Deathstalker II, The Warrior And The Sorceress & Barbarian Queen)"

1434845,AV8SJ3ZTW6WQ,B004ZKKKXI,Cinema Un-Verite,"[125, 126]","These are some of my favorite B movies of all time - real guilty pleasures!  Nothing beats a low budget barbarian film to lift the spirits!  These films have never looked better.  However, my favorite of the 4 films, Deathstalker II, appears in a cut version here.  This Deathstalker II version has its pros and cons.The Deathstalker II version in this set is the ""Director's approved cut of the film""  which is different in many ways from the previous DVD version which was released by New Concorde.  The ""director's cut"" visually looks much better than the previous release.  The image is widescreen and looks properly framed.  The image is brighter and the colors look great.  The previous DVD release often looked dark and murky.  The film now looks magnificent!However, the ""director's cut"" has a shorter running time than the previous release.  Two scenes have been deleted entirely and there are numerous cuts to other scenes and dialogue.  The back of the new Shout Factory case gives the film a running time of 85 minutes - my DVD player has the film's running time as 77 minutes.  The previous New Concorde release box gave a running time of 85 minutes, but the film actually ran 88 minutes.  Accordingly, this new release is 11 minutes shorter than the previous release!I did a side by side comparison with 2 TV's and the cuts can be listed as follows (the time marker given is that of the new Shout Factory release):11:00 - some dialogue between Deathstalker and Reena is missing12:45 - some dialogue between Deathstalker and Reena is missing16:45 - some dialogue between Sultana and Jarek is missing17:44 - an entire scene between Sultana and Evie is cut18:00 - some dialogue between Deathstalker and Reena is missing18:45 - At the meeting between Chin and Sultana in the tavern the stock footage from Deathstalker I has been removed32:35 - Stock footage from Deathstalker I has been removed and the following scene between Edie and the dwarf has been shortened by a few seconds48:00 - Some footage of the celebration after Deathstalker's defeat of Queen Kong has been deleted49:00 - Some dialogue between Deathsalker and the Queen of the Amazons has been deleted51:49 - Some dialogue between Sultana and Reena has been deleted55:45 - Establishing shots outside of castle (stock footage) has been deleted58:25 - an entire scene with Reena and the Amazon Queen getting a massage is deleted59:00 - Some dialogue between Deathstalker and Sultana has been deleted1:07:00 - Some stock footage of fighting (taken from Roger Corman's Amazons movie is deleted)1:08:45 - Some stock footage of fighting (taken from Roger Corman's Amazons movie is deleted)1:12:18 - Shots of cheering crowds and a triumphant Deathstalker and Reena with their arms raised looking at the crowds have been deletedDue to the above cuts, the director's commentary track has also been edited down to match the footage.The above cuts make the film seem tighter, faster paced and more serious.  However, some of the dialogue which was cut was funny and absurd (whether intentional or not) and was a big part of the film's charm.  I also miss the two scenes which were entirely deleted from the new release.  Of the two cuts, I prefer the previous version on the New Concorde DVD.Regardless of the above, the film is still great and a lot of fun.I highly recommend this dvd set to any fans of barbarian action films!",5,"These movies look great, but hold on to your old Deathstalker II DVDs!",1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,3392,"['are', 'favorite', 'B', 'movies', 'time', 'real', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'Nothing', 'low', 'budget', 'barbarian', 'film', 'lift', 'spirits', 'films', 'have', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'However', 'favorite', '4', 'films', 'Deathstalker', 'II', 'cut', 'version', 'here', 'Deathstalker', 'II', 'version', 'pros', 'cons.The', 'Deathstalker', 'II', 'version', 'set', 'Director', 'approved', 'cut', 'film', 'different', 'many', 'ways', 'previous', 'DVD', 'version', 'was', 'released', 'New', 'Concorde', 'director', 'cut', 'visually', 'much', 'better', 'previous', 'release', 'image', 'widescreen', 'properly', 'framed', 'image', 'brighter', 'colors', 'look', 'great', 'previous', 'DVD', 'release', 'often', 'looked', 'dark', 'murky', 'film', 'now', 'magnificent', 'However', 'director', 'cut', 'shorter', 'running', 'time', 'previous', 'release', 'Two', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'deleted', 'entirely', 'are', 'numerous', 'cuts', 'other', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'back', 'new', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'case', 'film', 'running', 'time', '85', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'player', 'film', 'running', 'time', '77', 'minutes', 'previous', 'New', 'Concorde', 'release', 'box', 'gave', 'running', 'time', '85', 'minutes', 'film', 'actually', 'ran', '88', 'minutes', 'Accordingly', 'new', 'release', '11', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'previous', 'release', 'did', 'side', 'side', 'comparison', '2', 'TV', 'cuts', 'can', 'be', 'listed', 'time', 'marker', 'given', 'new', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'release', ':11:00', 'dialogue', 'Deathstalker', 'Reena', 'missing12:45', 'dialogue', 'Deathstalker', 'Reena', 'missing16:45', 'dialogue', 'Sultana', 'Jarek', 'missing17:44', 'entire', 'scene', 'Sultana', 'Evie', 'cut18:00', 'dialogue', 'Deathstalker', 'Reena', 'missing18:45', 'meeting', 'Chin', 'Sultana', 'tavern', 'stock', 'footage', 'Deathstalker', 'been', 'removed32:35', 'Stock', 'footage', 'Deathstalker', 'been', 'removed', 'following', 'scene', 'Edie', 'dwarf', 'been', 'shortened', 'few', 'seconds48:00', 'footage', 'celebration', 'Deathstalker', 'defeat', 'Queen', 'Kong', 'been', 'deleted49:00', 'dialogue', 'Deathsalker', 'Queen', 'Amazons', 'been', 'deleted51:49', 'dialogue', 'Sultana', 'Reena', 'been', 'deleted55:45', 'Establishing', 'shots', 'castle', 'stock', 'footage', 'been', 'deleted58:25', 'entire', 'scene', 'Reena', 'Amazon', 'Queen', 'getting', 'massage', 'deleted59:00', 'dialogue', 'Deathstalker', 'Sultana', 'been', 'deleted1:07:00', 'stock', 'footage', 'fighting', 'taken', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'Amazons', 'movie', 'deleted', '1:08:45', 'stock', 'footage', 'fighting', 'taken', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'Amazons', 'movie', 'deleted', '1:12:18', 'Shots', 'cheering', 'crowds', 'triumphant', 'Deathstalker', 'Reena', 'arms', 'raised', 'looking', 'crowds', 'have', 'been', 'deletedDue', 'above', 'cuts', 'director', 'commentary', 'track', 'also', 'been', 'edited', 'match', 'footage.The', 'cuts', 'make', 'film', 'seem', 'tighter', 'faster', 'paced', 'more', 'serious', 'However', 'dialogue', 'was', 'cut', 'was', 'funny', 'absurd', 'intentional', 'not', 'was', 'big', 'part', 'film', 'charm', 'also', 'miss', 'two', 'scenes', 'were', 'entirely', 'deleted', 'new', 'release', 'two', 'cuts', 'prefer', 'previous', 'version', 'New', 'Concorde', 'DVD.Regardless', 'above', 'film', 'still', 'great', 'lot', 'fun.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'set', 'fans', 'barbarian', 'action', 'films']","Roger Corman's Cult Classics Sword And Sorcery Collection (Deathstalker, Deathstalker II, The Warrior And The Sorceress & Barbarian Queen)"

First off a beautiful job in the overall quality of the print. However no attempt was made in restoring the picture as done with Deathstalker 1 and 2. Here you still have the white specs occasionally showing up here and there. But the print is the best I've seen for this title and well worth the purchase price for this set.I love SHOUT'S dedication to these old flicks and do appreciate what they have done so far.I too like so many others however would love to see the film in its entirety as we saw it so many years ago. With the unedited segments back in. A nice restoration would be imperative to this long lost cult classic as well. An appropriate legacy to leave to the ""Barbarian Queen"" herself with such a tragic ending to her promising life. Side note,..Spectre may you rot in hell.If you guys read these reviews, the people at SHOUT please take this into consideration.A newly restored single disc ""Barbarian Queen"" and if possible unedited.Other titles I would love to see in the US market are ""Alienator"" and ""Interzone"" both starring another blonde amazon, Teagan Clive.

I enjoyed it far more than any of Arnold S's pictures which tire me out watching Arnold keep his muscles tensed for a complete movie!  The hero in the first Deathstalker pictures is much more believable and the women are super keeno!  The other three pictures of the Roger Corman's Classic Sword and Sorcery Collection are the worst I have ever suffered through.  In fact, Deathstalker II hit the trash can before I got half way through.  The other two were mindless crud and hit the trash before getting to the halfway point.  I will probably watch the original Deathstalker again to get the bad taste of the other three out of my mouth.  The Hero in Deathstalker II is a scrawny looking clown with a crooked smile, which he sports continuously throughout the feature.  He can't act or anything else.  I seldom resent throwing CD's in the trash, but for almost $19.00, this was a travesty.  I hate to say it, but I learned a hard lesson about buying collections.

The Princess' dad asks him to rescue her, but he refuses then decides to after fighting with a guy wearing a girl's top.The Barbarian Queen is just as confusing.  It's a story of revenge.  A village of barbarions are attacked before a big wedding.  The bride and a few others are spared so she plots to take revenge against a tyrant.  There is nudity and better fighting than Deathstalker, but it is a cheesy softcore movie.  Just be aware of that.All the other movies are just like this.  These are softcore porn if nothing else.  The action is horrible and I'm not who they were made for.  If you want boobs or sex, there isn't enough.  If you want action, it's really bad.

The Shout Factory is the first company that's released these movies in widescreen and they all look great for when they were made and the budget they were given. I remember when David Carradine died I found out he was in a b-rated fantasy movie... of course since he died the movie was going for 60 bucks on Amazon, so I'm glad I waited. The movie he plays in ""The Warrior And The Sorceress"" is easily the worst of the bunch, even I had trouble finishing it. It's pretty neat watching these, seeing all of the naked women and how they were treated, I don't think any studio no matter how small would publish this. I know for a fact they're all too racy for an ""R"" rating these days. ANyway, great set, definitely worth the small price being asked. The only trouble I had was on disc 2 there's areas to click on to watch The Warrior And The Sorceress and Barbarian Queen. I thought something went wrong because clicking on the movies starts up trailers for Corman movies... I thought the movies weren't on there at all, but they are, you just have to wait for the trailers to play through.
