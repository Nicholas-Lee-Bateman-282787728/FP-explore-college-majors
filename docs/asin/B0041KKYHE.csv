1381348,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B0041KKYHE,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[0, 1]","Water for Elephants starring Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon stays pretty much faithful of the best-selling novel by Sara Gruen. I thought Pattinson was perfectly cast as Jacob, boy his smile can sure light up a room! Pattinson is vulnerable yet smoldering, he captures the right emotion that is needed to play Jacob. I have always been a huge fan of Witherspoon but as Marlena, I thought she didn't quite pull off the part and surprisely seemed stiff and uncomfortable. Christoph Waltz made a very good and very scary August. This movie is just as good as the book, but this version is less sexual and abrasive. Water for Elephants is one classy, entertaining drama...I highly recommend it!",5,Breathtaking.,1323043200,"12 5, 2011",2011,698,"['Water', 'Elephants', 'starring', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'pretty', 'much', 'faithful', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'Sara', 'Gruen', 'thought', 'Pattinson', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Jacob', 'boy', 'smile', 'can', 'sure', 'light', 'up', 'room', 'Pattinson', 'vulnerable', 'yet', 'smoldering', 'right', 'emotion', 'needed', 'play', 'Jacob', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Witherspoon', 'Marlena', 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'off', 'part', 'surprisely', 'seemed', 'stiff', 'uncomfortable', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'made', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'scary', 'August', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'version', 'less', 'sexual', 'abrasive', 'Water', 'Elephants', 'one', 'classy', 'entertaining', 'drama', 'highly', 'recommend']",Water for Elephants
1381349,AAZRWLML88IZK,B0041KKYHE,A kids review,"[0, 2]","It's a bit too early to tell whether or not Robert Pattinson will forever be known primarily as Twilight's Edward Cullen, but it would seem that Water for Elephants, based on the NY Times Best Seller of the same name, isn't the film that will memorably set him apart from the popular teen vampire series. Pattinson plays Jacob, a twentysomething Cornell veterinary student during the Great Depression who, after learning his parents have died tragically and left a mountain of debt, decides to hop on a passing train in lieu of returning to school. As it turns out, the train belongs to the Benzini Brothers Circus, who hires Jacob as the circus's vet, and he soon falls in love with the head animal trainer's wife, Marlena. While the tale is tastefully told and beautifully filmed, I felt that that Water for Elephants suffered from a pronounced lack of chemistry between its leads, earning it 2 stars. It might do the trick if you're looking for an old-timey romance, but don't expect many sparks to fly.",2,Water for Elephants,1320710400,"11 8, 2011",2011,1006,"['bit', 'too', 'early', 'tell', 'not', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'known', 'primarily', 'Twilight', 'Edward', 'Cullen', 'would', 'seem', 'Water', 'Elephants', 'based', 'NY', 'Times', 'Best', 'Seller', 'same', 'name', ""n't"", 'film', 'will', 'memorably', 'set', 'apart', 'popular', 'teen', 'vampire', 'series', 'Pattinson', 'Jacob', 'twentysomething', 'Cornell', 'veterinary', 'student', 'Great', 'Depression', 'who', 'learning', 'parents', 'have', 'died', 'tragically', 'left', 'mountain', 'debt', 'hop', 'passing', 'train', 'lieu', 'returning', 'school', 'out', 'train', 'belongs', 'Benzini', 'Brothers', 'Circus', 'who', 'Jacob', 'circus', 'vet', 'soon', 'love', 'head', 'animal', 'trainer', 'wife', 'Marlena', 'tale', 'tastefully', 'told', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'felt', 'Water', 'Elephants', 'suffered', 'pronounced', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'leads', 'earning', '2', 'stars', 'might', 'do', 'trick', ""'re"", 'looking', 'old-timey', 'romance', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'many', 'sparks', 'fly']",Water for Elephants

1381351,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0041KKYHE,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 1]","Everybody, well, almost everybody had been to the circus as a kid, or later maybe. Many probably had their first exposure to the circus when some small side-show ramble wreak operation showed up made up of a three truck gypsy caravan came to you not big city town and put on a show or two and then headed out, laughing at the rubes as they left. Or maybe your first look was even less than a circus, a two bit neon-flamed carnival with every drifter, grafter and midnight sifter trying (and mostly succeeding) to get you to part with your hard-earned dough (back in the day maybe you had a kid job, mowing lawns or a paper route and so those were really hard-earned dollars that were soon departed). But mainly, if you didn't look too closely, at the ragged costumes, the ancient girlies, the broken-down animals, and the broken-down performers you bought into the grand circus illusion, the spectacle. What you bought into as well was the cotton candy, the kewpie dolls, and the other gee-gads. Just don't deny it okayAnd that illusion, or the creation of that illusion, for a couple of hours while rube or sophisticate was in the audience is what the film under review, Water For Elephants, is all about. Also about that seamy back story that any form of entertainment from kid street shows to Super Bowl extravaganza tries to keep away from.  And, naturally since this is a cinematic effort based on a historical romance novel, there has to be  a little off-hand love interest to keep the ""rubes"" in the theater audience (or at DVD home) interested.And just as naturally if Reese Witherspoon is in the house (last seen by this reviewer Oscar-winning for her performance as June Carter Cash in Walk The Line) that love interest must be both torrid and meaningful. And it is.The gist of the story (as told by ancient Hal Holbrook looking back to his youth) is the trials and tribulations of a veterinary doctor (almost) who by some personal misfortune winds up hopping a circus train during the Great Depression (the 1930s one not the current one) and who uses his skill to both help the animals and to become a key aide to the mad man circus owner (and ring master) who also happens to be a very jealous and evil husband of one Reese Witherspoon. The circus, as lots of things in those days, was ready to go belly up if there was not star attraction to pull the rubes in (basically get them under the tent and they are yours, the trick is to get them in). Presto, Ruby the elephant, not without some serious Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-type trauma brought on by the evil ring master, saves the day for a while. In the meantime that handsome young vet falls for one very married ring master's wife. And she for him. Something has to give, and it does. But next time the circus is in town think twice, no think three times, before starry-eyed thinking about heading out of town on that road.",4,...The Circus Is In Town,1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,2908,"['Everybody', 'well', 'almost', 'everybody', 'had', 'been', 'circus', 'kid', 'later', 'maybe', 'Many', 'probably', 'had', 'first', 'exposure', 'circus', 'when', 'small', 'side-show', 'ramble', 'wreak', 'operation', 'showed', 'up', 'made', 'three', 'truck', 'gypsy', 'caravan', 'came', 'not', 'big', 'city', 'town', 'put', 'show', 'two', 'then', 'headed', 'out', 'laughing', 'rubes', 'left', 'maybe', 'first', 'look', 'was', 'even', 'less', 'circus', 'two', 'bit', 'neon-flamed', 'carnival', 'drifter', 'grafter', 'midnight', 'sifter', 'trying', 'mostly', 'succeeding', 'get', 'part', 'hard-earned', 'dough', 'back', 'day', 'maybe', 'had', 'kid', 'job', 'mowing', 'lawns', 'paper', 'route', 'so', 'were', 'really', 'hard-earned', 'dollars', 'were', 'soon', 'departed', 'mainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'closely', 'ragged', 'costumes', 'ancient', 'girlies', 'broken-down', 'animals', 'broken-down', 'performers', 'bought', 'grand', 'circus', 'illusion', 'spectacle', 'What', 'bought', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'cotton', 'candy', 'kewpie', 'dolls', 'other', 'gee-gads', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'deny', 'okayAnd', 'illusion', 'creation', 'illusion', 'couple', 'hours', 'rube', 'sophisticate', 'was', 'audience', 'what', 'film', 'review', 'Water', 'Elephants', 'Also', 'back', 'story', 'form', 'entertainment', 'kid', 'street', 'shows', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'extravaganza', 'tries', 'keep', 'away', 'naturally', 'cinematic', 'effort', 'based', 'historical', 'romance', 'novel', 'be', 'little', 'off-hand', 'love', 'interest', 'keep', 'rubes', 'theater', 'audience', 'DVD', 'home', 'interested.And', 'just', 'naturally', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'house', 'last', 'seen', 'reviewer', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'Walk', 'Line', 'love', 'interest', 'must', 'be', 'torrid', 'meaningful', 'is.The', 'gist', 'story', 'told', 'ancient', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'looking', 'back', 'youth', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'veterinary', 'doctor', 'almost', 'who', 'personal', 'misfortune', 'up', 'hopping', 'circus', 'train', 'Great', 'Depression', '1930s', 'one', 'not', 'current', 'one', 'who', 'skill', 'help', 'animals', 'become', 'key', 'aide', 'mad', 'man', 'circus', 'owner', 'ring', 'master', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'very', 'jealous', 'evil', 'husband', 'one', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'circus', 'lots', 'things', 'days', 'was', 'ready', 'go', 'belly', 'up', 'was', 'not', 'star', 'attraction', 'pull', 'rubes', 'basically', 'get', 'tent', 'are', 'yours', 'trick', 'get', 'Presto', 'Ruby', 'elephant', 'not', 'serious', 'Society', 'Prevention', 'Cruelty', 'Animals-type', 'trauma', 'brought', 'evil', 'ring', 'master', 'day', 'while', 'meantime', 'handsome', 'young', 'vet', 'one', 'very', 'married', 'ring', 'master', 'wife', 'Something', 'give', 'next', 'time', 'circus', 'town', 'think', 'twice', 'think', 'three', 'times', 'starry-eyed', 'thinking', 'heading', 'town', 'road']",Water for Elephants

Good movie, started out a bit slow, but picked up near the middle. Complex story, cringe worthy at times if you're an animal lover, although not too bad because they did spare you a few scenes, which i was grateful for. Robert Pattinson was great and so likeable. I'm not judging off of his ""Edward"" character in Twilight which many seem unable to separate him from, i havent watched any of them. This character, alone, stands out for him as endearing, charming, heroic at times, ultimately, a big softy, which was fine! Loved his relationship with Rosie the elephant, and  Reese was equally as engaging, but for sure, Christopher Waltz stole the screen. Absolutely hated his character, but cannot deny that he played the role perfectly. There were times during the movie that i was afraid it would be one of those movie where at the end, everything is so terrible and nothing goes right and i would have felt that i wasted 2 hours of my life to end up so sad, but it was not.

I am not much for romantic movies but I still loved the movie. Of course the plot is about a young vet school dropout (played great by Robert Pattinson). He runs off after his parents died and joins the circus after hopping into a train. Then comes the reason why I saw the movie. Robert Pattinson meets the ringmaster (played spectacularly by Academy Award Winner Christoph Waltz). Then Pattinson meets the beautiful Reese Witherspoon who is riding a horse. They discover the horse is sick and Pattinson puts the horse down. They buy an elephant and Pattinson's job is to give the elephant water. Meanwhile, Pattinson and Witherspoon are falling in love and while that is happening, Waltz is getting more enraged and suspicious of them. Another reason I saw the movie was on the day I was getting ready to see it at the cinema, I was looking at the cast list and I saw Ken Foree. I screamed like a girl and shouted ""Ken Foree is in the movie!!!"" Ken Foree is one of my favorite actors. You may have seen him in other movies such as DAWN OF THE DEAD (1978 and 2004), LEATHERFACE: TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE III, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, KENAN & KEL, THE DENTIST, THE DEVIL'S DEN and Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN. As for the narrator of the story, he is played magnificently by Hal Holbrook (From movies such as THE FOG (1980), CREEPSHOW and many more).

1381388,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0041KKYHE,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[3, 3]","Beautifully made, beautiful scenery, and beautiful acting; that is what is wrong with Water for Elephants. This is a movie about the depression, the film should be gritty and dirty, and instead it was a perfectly clean, perfectly manicured Hollywood set.This is one of the most predictable movies I've seen in a long time. An old man shows up at night in a circus parking lot. He sees pictures of the Benzini Brothers Circus and waxes nostalgic. The young man that runs the ticket office is impressed that the man recognizes the Benzini Brothers Circus, it didn't exist beyond 1931. The film is then told in flashback with the old man narrating occasionally (his voice appears to remind the audience the film is really flashback).There are moments in films where I wonder why a character does a particular thing. If the thing is so far from the way a normal person would respond, I believe less and less in the film. Sometimes those actions are so far fetched the film jumps the shark, I can no longer enjoy the film. Water for Elephants is full of those strange moments where characters do things that just don't ring true. The first huge mistake, Jacob is in the middle of taking his last exam to become a veterinarian. His parents are killed in a car accident. Somebody interrupts the test; Jacob must come immediately to identify his parents in the morgue. He never goes back to take the test. No professor ever would have not allowed him to take that exam. It was a simple two hour test; he could have taken the test. The next big mistake, a few days later a banker tells Jacob his father had no money, was in debt beyond belief and they were taking away his house and all his belongings - Jacob is now homeless. The banker tells Jacob his father was a fool and an awful man. And the house was repossessed so fast, Jacob still has no chance to take his test. He barely has time to gather a single suitcase. No matter, the banker never would have said things exactly like that. Why tell somebody their dead father was an awful stupid man.The bottom line, for me, this movie jumped the shark within the first fifteen minutes. A lead character that was that stupid to not go back and finish, to just leave, I had a hard time believing any of his motivations from that point forward. In a lot of ways, I didn't really care deeply about what happened to him. And then to simply rub salt in the wound, Jacob was always perfect, his hair was perfect, he never got dirty, his clothes were nice, and he always had a silly smile on his face.The moment Jacob sets eyes on Marlena; it is clear what will happen. At roughly thirty minutes into the film, the ending is telegraphed. This film marched slowly, oh so slowly, down a predetermined path that was so predictable.Robert Pattinson, as Jacob, is supposed to be Polish. Pattinson tries to speak Polish a lot in this film, his Polish accent is awful. I'm terribly sorry to all the Pattinson fans, but he does a very bad job acting in this film. He's handsome and beautiful window dressing, but I never once believed any of his motivation or really cared much about what he did. The solution to his problems all seemed to be, smile, be handsome, and everything will be OK (it's kind of a blending of Tom Cruise and Robert Redford). Reese Witherspoon as Marlena had moments of good acting, but she also spent a lot of time just looking pretty and smiling. As much as I hated the August character, Christoph Waltz was the only believable character in this film. He was the best actor.So many little things that ruined this film. It was just way too Hollywood, too glossy, too perfectly done, too much of just a vehicle to pander for Pattinson fans. The film is two hours long and is honestly a full hour too long. The story plods along so slowly and relentlessly.Water for Elephants is a pretty film that shouldn't be pretty.",3,Slow Slow Slow - Long Long Long,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,3868,"['Beautifully', 'made', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'acting', 'what', 'wrong', 'Water', 'Elephants', 'movie', 'depression', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'gritty', 'dirty', 'instead', 'was', 'perfectly', 'clean', 'perfectly', 'manicured', 'Hollywood', 'set.This', 'one', 'most', 'predictable', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'old', 'man', 'up', 'night', 'circus', 'parking', 'lot', 'pictures', 'Benzini', 'Brothers', 'Circus', 'waxes', 'nostalgic', 'young', 'man', 'ticket', 'office', 'impressed', 'man', 'Benzini', 'Brothers', 'Circus', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', '1931', 'film', 'then', 'told', 'flashback', 'old', 'man', 'narrating', 'occasionally', 'voice', 'remind', 'audience', 'film', 'really', 'flashback', 'are', 'moments', 'films', 'where', 'wonder', 'why', 'character', 'particular', 'thing', 'thing', 'so', 'far', 'way', 'normal', 'person', 'would', 'respond', 'believe', 'less', 'less', 'film', 'Sometimes', 'actions', 'are', 'so', 'far', 'fetched', 'film', 'shark', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Water', 'Elephants', 'full', 'strange', 'moments', 'where', 'characters', 'do', 'things', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'first', 'huge', 'mistake', 'Jacob', 'middle', 'taking', 'last', 'exam', 'become', 'veterinarian', 'parents', 'are', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'Somebody', 'test', 'Jacob', 'must', 'come', 'immediately', 'identify', 'parents', 'morgue', 'never', 'back', 'take', 'test', 'No', 'professor', 'ever', 'would', 'have', 'not', 'allowed', 'take', 'exam', 'was', 'simple', 'two', 'hour', 'test', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'test', 'next', 'big', 'mistake', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'banker', 'Jacob', 'father', 'had', 'money', 'was', 'debt', 'belief', 'were', 'taking', 'away', 'house', 'belongings', 'Jacob', 'now', 'homeless', 'banker', 'Jacob', 'father', 'was', 'fool', 'awful', 'man', 'house', 'was', 'repossessed', 'so', 'fast', 'Jacob', 'still', 'chance', 'take', 'test', 'barely', 'time', 'gather', 'single', 'suitcase', 'matter', 'banker', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'things', 'exactly', 'Why', 'tell', 'somebody', 'dead', 'father', 'was', 'awful', 'stupid', 'man.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'jumped', 'shark', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'lead', 'character', 'was', 'stupid', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'finish', 'just', 'leave', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'motivations', 'point', 'forward', 'lot', 'ways', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'deeply', 'what', 'happened', 'then', 'simply', 'rub', 'salt', 'wound', 'Jacob', 'was', 'always', 'perfect', 'hair', 'was', 'perfect', 'never', 'got', 'dirty', 'clothes', 'were', 'nice', 'always', 'had', 'silly', 'smile', 'face.The', 'moment', 'Jacob', 'eyes', 'Marlena', 'clear', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'roughly', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'film', 'ending', 'telegraphed', 'film', 'marched', 'slowly', 'oh', 'so', 'slowly', 'down', 'predetermined', 'path', 'was', 'so', 'predictable.Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Jacob', 'supposed', 'be', 'Polish', 'Pattinson', 'speak', 'Polish', 'lot', 'film', 'Polish', 'accent', 'awful', ""'m"", 'terribly', 'sorry', 'Pattinson', 'fans', 'very', 'bad', 'job', 'acting', 'film', 'handsome', 'beautiful', 'window', 'dressing', 'never', 'once', 'believed', 'motivation', 'really', 'cared', 'much', 'what', 'did', 'solution', 'problems', 'seemed', 'be', 'smile', 'be', 'handsome', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'OK', 'kind', 'blending', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Marlena', 'had', 'moments', 'good', 'acting', 'also', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'just', 'looking', 'pretty', 'smiling', 'As', 'much', 'hated', 'August', 'character', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'was', 'only', 'believable', 'character', 'film', 'was', 'best', 'actor.So', 'many', 'little', 'things', 'ruined', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'Hollywood', 'too', 'glossy', 'too', 'perfectly', 'done', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'vehicle', 'pander', 'Pattinson', 'fans', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'honestly', 'full', 'hour', 'too', 'long', 'story', 'plods', 'so', 'slowly', 'relentlessly.Water', 'Elephants', 'pretty', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'pretty']",Water for Elephants
1381389,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B0041KKYHE,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[11, 24]","""Water for Elephants"" is a flat soap opera lacking flair or heart or even coherence. It's a love story set in a Depression-era circus; how could it be so boring? Direction and miscasting. Director Francis Lawrence never milks the Depression or the circus setting. He directs as if in the suburban living and bedrooms of television's Pine Valley. You never get the sense of how a Depression-era, small-town kid would be thrilled, terrified, and curious seeing a lion or an elephant for the first time. There are a couple of what appear to be CGI shots of a train chugging across moonlit landscapes; even these lack magic.Robert Pattinson, star of the teen-vampire sensation ""Twilight,"" is miscast as Jacob, the lead character, a circus vet. Pattinson displays the skills necessary to make teenage girls swoon: he pouts, he broods, he is self-absorbed, he makes zero intellectual or psychological demands on his audience. He has heavy brows and lots of hair. These skills deserve respect. They cause teen girl fans to post reviews of his work that end in multiple exclamation points!!!!!!! But Pattinson is in so far over his head in ""Water for Elephants"" all you see of him, in some scenes, are bubbles on the surface as he sinks into invisibility.Reese Witherspoon is a crisp and perky professional with shiny hair and perfect teeth. Problem is, she's playing Marlena, an orphan trick horse rider who marries an abusive circus boss, August (Christoph Waltz.) Marlena should exude desperate vulnerability combined with manipulative power, the kinky raw sex appeal of a woman who, scantily clad in skin-tight, revealing costumes, performs suggestive tricks with muscly animals in front of applauding throngs. Witherspoon doesn't even try to bring that Marlena to life. She just plays Reese Witherspoon, professional movie star with flawless hair and teeth, a little bit bored as Oprah interviews her. There's nothing of the abusive orphanage, the poor street, the skanky Big Top about her at all.Robert Pattinson's Jacob and Reese Witherspoon's Marlena have zero chemistry. They are the least sexy screen couple I've ever seen. Al Gore and Bill Clinton had more chemistry. When they do kiss, it's not that long-awaited, thrilling moment of release. It's ""Huh?""Christoph Waltz as August, the circus owner, is from a completely different, much better, movie. People are going to walk out of this film wishing that they could have seen the movie centered around Christoph Waltz's August. Waltz demands the audience's attention in a way that no one else in the film does, except Tai as the elephant, Rosie. Waltz's nuanced performance brings to life an August who is very complex and worth caring about, despite his being a monster.It's clear that Sara Gruen, the book's author, and the filmmaker wanted to tell a story that featured lots of animals. The plot is a cobbled-together, soulless bit of scaffolding on which to hang shots of circus animals and shallow depictions of circus rituals. Why is Jacob a Polish speaker? Why is the elephant a speaker of Polish? Most Polish immigrants to the US at this time were descendents of recently liberated serfs, and did very harsh manual labor in the US: coal mining, steel, cleaning. It's very unlikely that a Polish speaker would be an Ivy League veterinary school graduate. In any case, the film makes no use of Jacob's ethnicity. He could as easily be Spanish or Italian or Greek. Why would a man who had the focus and self-discipline to complete an Ivy League veterinary school education toss aside, literally, everything he has worked for, and everything he owns, to jump on a passing train? The moment utterly lacks verisimilitude and psychological depth. It's obvious that the film just wants to get to its circus setting and animals. Jacob is just a pawn. Why is the film told as an old man's flashback? That approach, and the voiceover narration, add nothing to the film.",2,Soap Opera Lacks Flair or Heart; Waltz Is Great,1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,3921,"['Water', 'Elephants', 'flat', 'soap', 'opera', 'lacking', 'flair', 'heart', 'even', 'coherence', 'love', 'story', 'set', 'Depression-era', 'circus', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'boring', 'Direction', 'miscasting', 'Director', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'never', 'Depression', 'circus', 'setting', 'suburban', 'living', 'bedrooms', 'television', 'Pine', 'Valley', 'never', 'get', 'sense', 'how', 'Depression-era', 'small-town', 'kid', 'would', 'be', 'thrilled', 'terrified', 'curious', 'seeing', 'lion', 'elephant', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'couple', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'CGI', 'shots', 'train', 'chugging', 'moonlit', 'landscapes', 'even', 'lack', 'magic.Robert', 'Pattinson', 'star', 'teen-vampire', 'sensation', 'Twilight', 'miscast', 'Jacob', 'lead', 'character', 'circus', 'vet', 'Pattinson', 'skills', 'necessary', 'make', 'teenage', 'girls', 'swoon', 'self-absorbed', 'zero', 'intellectual', 'psychological', 'demands', 'audience', 'heavy', 'brows', 'lots', 'hair', 'skills', 'deserve', 'respect', 'cause', 'teen', 'girl', 'fans', 'post', 'reviews', 'work', 'end', 'multiple', 'exclamation', 'points', 'Pattinson', 'so', 'far', 'head', 'Water', 'Elephants', 'see', 'scenes', 'are', 'bubbles', 'surface', 'invisibility.Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'crisp', 'perky', 'professional', 'shiny', 'hair', 'perfect', 'teeth', 'Problem', 'playing', 'Marlena', 'orphan', 'trick', 'horse', 'rider', 'who', 'abusive', 'circus', 'boss', 'August', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'Marlena', 'should', 'exude', 'desperate', 'vulnerability', 'combined', 'manipulative', 'power', 'kinky', 'raw', 'sex', 'appeal', 'woman', 'who', 'scantily', 'clad', 'skin-tight', 'revealing', 'costumes', 'performs', 'suggestive', 'tricks', 'muscly', 'animals', 'front', 'applauding', 'throngs', 'Witherspoon', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'bring', 'Marlena', 'life', 'just', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'professional', 'movie', 'star', 'flawless', 'hair', 'teeth', 'little', 'bit', 'bored', 'Oprah', 'nothing', 'abusive', 'orphanage', 'poor', 'street', 'skanky', 'Big', 'Top', 'all.Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Jacob', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Marlena', 'have', 'zero', 'chemistry', 'are', 'least', 'sexy', 'screen', 'couple', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Al', 'Gore', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'had', 'more', 'chemistry', 'When', 'do', 'kiss', 'not', 'long-awaited', 'thrilling', 'moment', 'release', 'Huh', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'August', 'circus', 'owner', 'completely', 'different', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'People', 'are', 'going', 'walk', 'film', 'wishing', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'centered', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'August', 'Waltz', 'audience', 'attention', 'way', 'one', 'else', 'film', 'except', 'Tai', 'elephant', 'Rosie', 'Waltz', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'brings', 'life', 'August', 'who', 'very', 'complex', 'worth', 'caring', 'being', 'monster.It', 'clear', 'Sara', 'Gruen', 'book', 'author', 'filmmaker', 'wanted', 'tell', 'story', 'featured', 'lots', 'animals', 'plot', 'cobbled-together', 'soulless', 'bit', 'scaffolding', 'hang', 'shots', 'circus', 'animals', 'shallow', 'depictions', 'circus', 'rituals', 'Why', 'Jacob', 'Polish', 'speaker', 'Why', 'elephant', 'speaker', 'Polish', 'Most', 'Polish', 'immigrants', 'US', 'time', 'were', 'descendents', 'recently', 'liberated', 'serfs', 'did', 'very', 'harsh', 'manual', 'labor', 'US', 'coal', 'mining', 'steel', 'cleaning', 'very', 'unlikely', 'Polish', 'speaker', 'would', 'be', 'Ivy', 'League', 'veterinary', 'school', 'graduate', 'case', 'film', 'use', 'Jacob', 'ethnicity', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'Spanish', 'Italian', 'Greek', 'Why', 'would', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'focus', 'self-discipline', 'complete', 'Ivy', 'League', 'veterinary', 'school', 'education', 'aside', 'literally', 'everything', 'worked', 'everything', 'jump', 'passing', 'train', 'moment', 'utterly', 'verisimilitude', 'psychological', 'depth', 'obvious', 'film', 'just', 'get', 'circus', 'setting', 'animals', 'Jacob', 'just', 'pawn', 'Why', 'film', 'told', 'old', 'man', 'flashback', 'approach', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'add', 'nothing', 'film']",Water for Elephants

When I watched the movie I quickly realized it was vastly more than that and was, in fact, a truly remarkable story of a young man who is thrust into unexpected circumstances by a tragedy in his family.The movie was warm, sympathetic, and involving and held our interest from the very beginning. It is told as a flashback by an elderly Jason, played by Hal Holbrook, and tells his story as a young man, played by Robert Pattinson, who is from a close knit family and is about to graduate as a vet when tragedy strikes his family. This sudden change of circumstances stuns the young Jason who starts seeking a new direction for his life.The story is set in the year 1931 as the great depression is taking hold on the nation and so many are suffering without jobs, shelter, and food. Jason's training as a vet helps him get a job with a circus which is struggling to survive in those troubled times. The star of the circus, the wife of the owner, Marlena, played by Reese Whitherspoon becomes an object of fascination for Jason which introduces serious complications for all of them.All of the elements required to make a fine movie are there and are beautifully molded to create a captivating story of life in all of its aspects. The scenery, acting, costumes, music, and directing all work harmoniously together to carry the viewer out of his seat and into life in a circus during the depression.This is a movie that deserves to be watched and I recommend it highly for adults and older children.

Boy quickly learns that boss is a jerk to everyone, especially to the circus animals and his own wife.The whole thing is actually being recounted by the now elderly man, to an employee of a circus after he's stood up by his son.The jerk boss performs acts of violence that are incredibly difficult to watch (Christop Waltz has perfected playing a jerk).  And as I've already said the elephant is the star here.  Hal Holbrook plays the elderly version of the main character in such a sweet way.  Even still, overall, it's just okay at its best.

1381398,A11PTCZ2FM2547,B0041KKYHE,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","Because the significant other is an unabashed lover of the book (and my To Be Read List is already jammed with other titles for the foreseeable future), I grabbed the opportunity to see WATER FOR ELEPHANTS.  The film did meander a bit on occasion, there are just about no sparks between leads Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson (and it's readily apparent they are anything but near the same age), and those are the only negative things I'm going to say about this Francis Lawrence adaptation of the Sara Gruen bestseller.  This is a finely crafted, moving story about a down-on-his-luck vet student dropout joining a struggling Depression Era circus as an elephant trainer, um, in training.  The troupe lives on a train, traveling from one performance to another, unloading, building, performing, disassembling, reloading, and moving on.  The interactions between the various performers and crew are believable, with everyone on board grimly aware of the bipolar behaviour of the circus owner and ringmaster, August (Christopher Waltz is a very good villain).I had no idea Hal Holbrook was still alive, so what a pleasant surprise to see him set up, then narrate, the story from the point of view of Jacob (Pattinson).  Holbrook brings emotion, tenderness, and poignancy to his character and the love story of Jacob and Marlena (Witherspoon).  Not only is she married to August, Marlena is the top billing act of the Benzini Brothers Circus riding Rosie the elephant; thus Jacob and Marlena spend plenty of time together training the animal and working on the act--with Jacob growing increasingly more irate with August's brutality of Rosie. . .and Marlena.  In spite of themselves Jacob and Marlena fall in love, August unravels, there is voluminous violence and cruelty as he lashes back, which culminates in a dizzying climactic scene where the lesson learned is:  don't mess with Rosie.  Holbrook wraps up the narration by telling his present day circus exec (Paul Schneider), ""I'm not running away. . .I'm coming home!""

1381404,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0041KKYHE,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 11]","Even though this 2011 period movie makes no bones about echoing the epic romanticism ofTitanicand offers Jack Fisk's evocative production design to back up its claim, director Francis Lawrence and screenwriter Richard LaGravenese cannot seem to conjure up the cinematic magic necessary to pull off the old-fashioned melodrama that's at the heart of the story based on Sara Gruen's best-selling2006 novel. That's not to say there aren't any dramatically affecting moments sprinkled throughout, but taken as a whole, the film falls short in capturing the robust, often fatalistic life under the big top and the depth and complexity of the entangled protagonists, which are portrayed by a trio of stars to variable results. TheTitanicreference is apt since Lawrence follows Gruen's similar bookending technique with nonagenarian Jacob Jankowski reminiscing in the present-day about his transformative experience working in a Depression-era traveling circus.The story flashes back to Jacob's memories of his youth in 1931 when he faces a sudden family tragedy as a veterinary student who is unable to graduate and inadvertently hops on a traveling circus train. His background in animal medicine proves helpful as he is hired to tend to the animals, in particular, a limp show horse beloved by the circus' star performer Marlena. She is married to the owner and ringmaster, August Rosenbluth, a conflicted totalitarian who thinks animals can only respond to cruel proddings and beatings. He takes an initial liking to Jacob, and soon Jacob finds himself training August's latest acquisition, a libation-loving elephant named Rosie upon which Marlena learns to perform acrobatic stunts. However, August's continued sadistic treatment of the animals, especially Rosie, proves to be a catalyst for Jacob and Marlene coming closer together. The rest of the plot is inevitable highlighted by a climactic scene where the circus animals are freed and wreak intractable havoc. Looking inspired by James Dean inEast of Eden, Robert Pattinson is an unfortunate blank slate as the younger Jacob, alternating between glazed looks and camera-ready grins.Part of the problem is the fact that the character was written to be an observer for much of the narrative, but Pattinson doesn't exhibit the chops necessary to make Jacob's situation more involving or provide a convincing transition to the feisty senior citizen played with gusto by Hal Holbrook. Reese Witherspoon has the chops but seems wrongly cast here. Known for her steely intelligence and down-to-earth demeanor (Legally Blondeaside), she carries a screen persona at odds with the victimized platinum-blonde glamour girl she attempts to portray as Marlena. Truth be told, the actress is too contemporary in sensibility and not languid enough for a role that would have been a better fit for the likes of Charlize Theron or even Angelina Jolie. There is also an awkward lack of romantic sparks between Pattinson and Witherspoon. Christoph Waltz, however, is terrifically malevolent as August, bringing that same odd touch of vulnerability he brought to his Nazi colonel inInglourious Basterds, even though the character is more predictable here. Fans of period pieces may enjoy the proceedings, but there is a nagging sense throughout that the movie could have been so much more.",3,Life Under the Big Top Lacks a Genuinely Convincing Lead,1305590400,"05 17, 2011",2011,3323,"['Even', '2011', 'period', 'movie', 'bones', 'echoing', 'epic', 'romanticism', 'ofTitanicand', 'Jack', 'Fisk', 'evocative', 'production', 'design', 'back', 'up', 'claim', 'director', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'screenwriter', 'Richard', 'LaGravenese', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'conjure', 'up', 'cinematic', 'magic', 'necessary', 'pull', 'off', 'old-fashioned', 'melodrama', 'heart', 'story', 'based', 'Sara', 'Gruen', 'best-selling2006', 'novel', 'not', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'dramatically', 'affecting', 'moments', 'sprinkled', 'taken', 'whole', 'film', 'short', 'capturing', 'robust', 'often', 'fatalistic', 'life', 'big', 'top', 'depth', 'complexity', 'entangled', 'protagonists', 'are', 'portrayed', 'trio', 'stars', 'variable', 'results', 'TheTitanicreference', 'apt', 'Lawrence', 'Gruen', 'similar', 'bookending', 'technique', 'nonagenarian', 'Jacob', 'Jankowski', 'reminiscing', 'present-day', 'transformative', 'experience', 'working', 'Depression-era', 'traveling', 'circus.The', 'story', 'flashes', 'back', 'Jacob', 'memories', 'youth', '1931', 'when', 'sudden', 'family', 'tragedy', 'veterinary', 'student', 'who', 'unable', 'graduate', 'inadvertently', 'traveling', 'circus', 'train', 'background', 'animal', 'medicine', 'helpful', 'hired', 'tend', 'animals', 'particular', 'limp', 'show', 'horse', 'beloved', 'circus', 'star', 'performer', 'Marlena', 'married', 'owner', 'ringmaster', 'August', 'Rosenbluth', 'conflicted', 'totalitarian', 'who', 'animals', 'can', 'only', 'respond', 'cruel', 'proddings', 'beatings', 'initial', 'liking', 'Jacob', 'soon', 'Jacob', 'training', 'August', 'latest', 'acquisition', 'libation-loving', 'elephant', 'named', 'Rosie', 'Marlena', 'perform', 'acrobatic', 'stunts', 'However', 'August', 'continued', 'sadistic', 'treatment', 'animals', 'especially', 'Rosie', 'be', 'catalyst', 'Jacob', 'Marlene', 'coming', 'closer', 'together', 'rest', 'plot', 'inevitable', 'highlighted', 'climactic', 'scene', 'where', 'circus', 'animals', 'are', 'freed', 'wreak', 'intractable', 'havoc', 'Looking', 'inspired', 'James', 'Dean', 'inEast', 'Eden', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'unfortunate', 'blank', 'slate', 'younger', 'Jacob', 'alternating', 'glazed', 'looks', 'camera-ready', 'grins.Part', 'problem', 'fact', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'be', 'observer', 'much', 'narrative', 'Pattinson', ""n't"", 'exhibit', 'chops', 'necessary', 'make', 'Jacob', 'situation', 'more', 'involving', 'provide', 'convincing', 'transition', 'feisty', 'senior', 'citizen', 'played', 'gusto', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'chops', 'wrongly', 'cast', 'here', 'Known', 'steely', 'intelligence', 'down-to-earth', 'demeanor', 'Legally', 'Blondeaside', 'screen', 'persona', 'odds', 'victimized', 'platinum-blonde', 'glamour', 'girl', 'portray', 'Marlena', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'actress', 'too', 'contemporary', 'sensibility', 'not', 'languid', 'enough', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'fit', 'likes', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'even', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'also', 'awkward', 'lack', 'romantic', 'sparks', 'Pattinson', 'Witherspoon', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'however', 'terrifically', 'malevolent', 'August', 'bringing', 'same', 'odd', 'touch', 'vulnerability', 'brought', 'Nazi', 'colonel', 'inInglourious', 'Basterds', 'even', 'character', 'more', 'predictable', 'here', 'Fans', 'period', 'pieces', 'may', 'enjoy', 'proceedings', 'nagging', 'sense', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more']",Water for Elephants

1381413,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0041KKYHE,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","WATER FOR ELEPHANTS succeeds on many levels: it offers a satisfying transfer of the novel by Sara Gruen to the screen by Richard LaGravenese, the direction by Francis Lawrence is well paced, the sets and costumes capture the flavor of 1931 and the transient popularity of traveling circuses, and boasts a cast that manages to find the focus of the many characters that make this story interesting.  If it dips into the saccharine mode at the end, even that is used in a manner that makes if a satisfying way to end the story,The film opens with the old Jacob (Hal Holbrook) relating the history of the fall of the  Benzini Brothers Circus in 1931  to a contemporary Charlie (Paul Schneider). Old Jacob's voice is soon assumed by the young Jacob (Robert Pattinson), show preparing for his doctorate exam in Veterinary Medicine when he is told that his beloved Polish immigrant parents have been killed in an accident: the money for Jacob's education came form borrowing against their home so Jacob is abruptly homeless, and despite the fact that he didn't finish his Cornell exams he strikes out on his own looking for a future in the time of the Great Depression. He happens upon a circus owned by August Rosenbluth (Christoph Waltz) and  starring his wife Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) as a  woman with horse tricks. Marlena's horse is sick, Jacob's veterinary skills make the diagnosis of a fatal condition and despite the wishes of August he has the courage to put down the ailing horse.  Marlena sees the compassion in Jacob and a mutual attraction begins.  August is somewhat bipolar and in the long run copes with the increasingly evident attraction between Jacob and Marlena.  The Circus is struggling in the hard times and August is known for throwing men off the train that carries  the little circus from town to town to reduce costs.  August comes across an elephant name Rose, buys her, and in time with Jacobs's discovery that Rosie understands Polish commands Rosie and Marlena bring the circus great audiences and luck.  But the schism between the wild behavior of August toward both Jacob and Marlena leads to an ending that results in the ultimate closure of the circus and the end of August.  It is the survival of Jacob and Marlena that completes the ending of the tale.The three main actors - Waltz, Pattinson and Witherspoon - carry the film well, but the cameos among the supporting cast provide just the right flavor to make the story not only credible but also in recreating a tragic period in American history. Those actors include fine portrayals by Jim Norton, Scott MacDonald, James Frain, Mark Povinelli among others. The sets and costumes are superb and the musical score by James Newton Howard is first rate.  This is a well done reproduction of a successful novel that offers much food for thought.

Academy Award winner Reese Witherspoon is utterly captivating & endearing as the woman Jacob (Robert Pattinso, proving that his acting range is not limited by the shallow Twilight movies) falls in love with. Academy Award winner Christoph Waltz tones down his crazy Nazi performance in Inglourious Basterds just enough for this subtle PG-13 rated film. The acting by everyone is great, and the story never drags. The musical score by James Newton Howard is absolutely lovely.So, why the four-star rating? The LORD's Name is misused on several occasions as a strong profanity. ""Thou shalt not take the Name of the LORD thy God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain.""

1381419,A12ZPIDVB4YSOD,B0041KKYHE,"HDTwoodsman ""HDT""","[1, 3]","I have reasonable expectations for movie adaptations.  Those who try to sound intelligent citing the superiority of a book over a film actually sound ignorant.  The ONLY time the comparison should be made is when the movie is preferable.  But, 'Water for Elephants' was a book that read like a great film.  If that doesn't make sense, I'm not sure I can explain it any better.Sara Gruen wrote rich characters and majestic scenery.  This is a traveling tale about a group of people trapped in static life.  The main character is a very likable young man whose difficult personal struggles coincide with a harsh historical period.  The traveling circus story has been told many times, but has never felt more authentic.  You attach immediately to Jacob and a vivid picture of each character is drawn.  I remember thinking that Jacob's bunk-mate, Kinko, could finally offer a dwarf actor an Oscar worthy role.  Instead, Kinko is a minor character in a mediocre film.It isn't easy to pinpoint where this film went wrong.  The acting is sufficient, the scenery is beautiful, the animals are interesting, it's just OFF.  I was excited to see the movie and found myself ready to stop the DVD half-way through.  Again, my expectations were reasonable, but the film didn't capture any aspect of the book.I'm more interested in defending the book than trashing the movie.  This was fantastic story that just didn't adapt well to the screen.  After watching the movie, I'm not sure ANY film-maker could have done a better job (a defeatist attitude, I know).

1381422,A55RQ26WDPSM0,B0041KKYHE,Iusedtobeacat,"[1, 2]","I don't know where to start, so I'll just start with my Honesty. I read the book a while back before there was even talk of a movie and my impression on it was (well, I didn't loath the story but I was a bit disappointed) Probably because of all the hype surrounding the book.  Anyway You guys want my review of the movie not the book so here it is, however I would say that my watching this is out of curiosity than actual interest and I found the movie adoption to be Good in general except there are somethings that got in the way (IMHO) that made me rate this 3 stars instead of 4 or 5.-PROS : 1-The Photography is perfect. The sets are beautiful, the customs are wonderful. I don't have much knowledge about the 3os but the customs and the attires shown made me wish I lived during those times (minus the bad economy of course). Anyway this movie was a visual feast. It was really beautiful to look at. The circus, animals, even the actors. However I do wish they included more extras as audience in the circus (I mean it is called the most spectacular show on Earth after all) but if we were to overlook that then all's fine. 2-The Plot twist by the second half of the film. As an adoption this film did took some liberties. I don't want to give too much away but for those of you who read the book you'll notice that somethings in this film didn't go exactly the same way it did in the original story. I personally didn't mind that much I thought it was good as to make the plot unpredictable and not boring for who read the book except for one scene which I'll talk about in a moment. 3-I liked Rob Pat as Jacob here better than Edward Cullen, I actually like him at any role more than I like him in Twilight so I was happy to see him try something mature, different. He's a good actor and Water for Elephants is a step in the right direction.-CONS:1-The Make-Up. O.K When the bad guys beat Jacob towards the end, he has bruises on his face that are so obviously fake. I thought the Make Up artists could've done a better job at creating them more than just applying extensive blush we are talking about a major motion picture after all (I just found myself not believing them). 2-The Love scene *sigh* was a let down, it was awkward and contrived. I'm not a prude by anyway I'm all for sex scenes if they add to the plot or are beautifully done I guess. This one however didn't add anything to the story that it could have just been easily edited out.3-The other scene that I thought could have been edited out is the scene where Jacob was planning on killing August and not doing it. What was the point of that I wonder ? I can't remember if it was in the book or not but I think either way it could've been just deleted.4-Well, Uncle Al the character from the book is totally omitted and his roles are filled by August. Hmm, I wonder why ? Did they not found a perfect actor ? Or did they thought its better for the plot to leave him out ? I don't know I just thought if they added him it would probably make no difference to the plot much add to the plot actually.5-The ending is abrupt and the action was a bit lacking but it isn't an action film so that's to be expected. However I did want more insight into the ending. 6-The Dialogue was lacking, the book didn't have much going on for it but I thought the writers could've done a better job.Favorite Scenes/moments : The scene between Marlena and Jacob Where they are trying to teach Rosie is sweet. (I always thought their romance to be contrived but it got me there). The Lion scene where August is telling Jacob to feed him is well done I really thought he was going to bite poor Jacob. The scene where the circus animals are set free and running around scaring the audience (almost all the action in the movie is summed up in that scene). The Party scene and its aftermath where Jacob wakes up w/a hangover.I guess fans of the book will be disappointed. On my part though I wasn't. I usually prefer books over movies but this time I believe in a rare exception I liked the movie just a bit more.The cast was good, I was always indifferent to Reese Witherspoon as an actress actually but she looks the part of Marlena and she does good with what she has, However her best performance to date is in Walk the Line.In the end this movie is worth a rent and if you liked it you can always buy it later. I'm sorry if I'm being too harsh by rating this only 3 stars (I'm definitely in the minority here) but I'm trying to be honest in my review.",3,"The Great, the Bad and the So and So  *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*",1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,4509,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'start', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'start', 'Honesty', 'read', 'book', 'while', 'back', 'was', 'even', 'talk', 'movie', 'impression', 'was', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'loath', 'story', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'Probably', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'book', 'Anyway', 'guys', 'want', 'review', 'movie', 'not', 'book', 'so', 'here', 'however', 'would', 'say', 'watching', 'curiosity', 'actual', 'interest', 'found', 'movie', 'adoption', 'be', 'Good', 'general', 'are', 'somethings', 'got', 'way', 'IMHO', 'made', 'rate', '3', 'stars', 'instead', '4', '5.-PROS', '1-The', 'Photography', 'perfect', 'sets', 'are', 'beautiful', 'customs', 'are', 'wonderful', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'knowledge', '3os', 'customs', 'attires', 'shown', 'made', 'wish', 'lived', 'times', 'bad', 'economy', 'course', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'was', 'visual', 'feast', 'was', 'really', 'beautiful', 'look', 'circus', 'animals', 'even', 'actors', 'However', 'do', 'wish', 'included', 'more', 'extras', 'audience', 'circus', 'mean', 'called', 'most', 'spectacular', 'show', 'Earth', 'were', 'overlook', 'then', 'fine', '2-The', 'Plot', 'twist', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'adoption', 'film', 'did', 'took', 'liberties', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'who', 'read', 'book', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'somethings', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'exactly', 'same', 'way', 'did', 'original', 'story', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'much', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'make', 'plot', 'unpredictable', 'not', 'boring', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'one', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'talk', 'moment', '3-I', 'liked', 'Rob', 'Pat', 'Jacob', 'here', 'better', 'Edward', 'Cullen', 'actually', 'role', 'more', 'like', 'Twilight', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'try', 'something', 'mature', 'different', 'good', 'actor', 'Water', 'Elephants', 'step', 'right', 'direction.-CONS:1-The', 'Make-Up', 'O.K', 'When', 'bad', 'guys', 'beat', 'Jacob', 'end', 'bruises', 'face', 'are', 'so', 'obviously', 'fake', 'thought', 'Make', 'Up', 'artists', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'better', 'job', 'creating', 'more', 'just', 'applying', 'extensive', 'blush', 'are', 'talking', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'just', 'found', 'not', 'believing', '2-The', 'Love', 'scene', '*sigh*', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'was', 'awkward', 'contrived', ""'m"", 'not', 'prude', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'sex', 'scenes', 'add', 'plot', 'are', 'beautifully', 'done', 'guess', 'one', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'easily', 'edited', 'out.3-The', 'other', 'scene', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'out', 'scene', 'where', 'Jacob', 'was', 'planning', 'killing', 'August', 'not', 'doing', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'wonder', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'was', 'book', 'not', 'think', 'way', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'just', 'deleted.4-Well', 'Uncle', 'Al', 'character', 'book', 'totally', 'omitted', 'roles', 'are', 'filled', 'August', 'Hmm', 'wonder', 'why', 'Did', 'not', 'found', 'perfect', 'actor', 'did', 'thought', 'better', 'plot', 'leave', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'thought', 'added', 'would', 'probably', 'make', 'difference', 'plot', 'much', 'add', 'plot', 'actually.5-The', 'ending', 'abrupt', 'action', 'was', 'bit', 'lacking', ""n't"", 'action', 'film', 'be', 'expected', 'However', 'did', 'want', 'more', 'insight', 'ending', '6-The', 'Dialogue', 'was', 'lacking', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'going', 'thought', 'writers', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'better', 'job.Favorite', 'Scenes/moments', 'scene', 'Marlena', 'Jacob', 'Where', 'are', 'trying', 'teach', 'Rosie', 'sweet', 'always', 'thought', 'romance', 'be', 'contrived', 'got', 'Lion', 'scene', 'where', 'August', 'telling', 'Jacob', 'feed', 'well', 'done', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'bite', 'poor', 'Jacob', 'scene', 'where', 'circus', 'animals', 'are', 'set', 'free', 'running', 'around', 'scaring', 'audience', 'almost', 'action', 'movie', 'summed', 'up', 'scene', 'Party', 'scene', 'aftermath', 'where', 'Jacob', 'up', 'w/a', 'hangover.I', 'guess', 'fans', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'part', 'was', ""n't"", 'usually', 'prefer', 'books', 'movies', 'time', 'believe', 'rare', 'exception', 'liked', 'movie', 'just', 'bit', 'more.The', 'cast', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'always', 'indifferent', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'actress', 'actually', 'part', 'Marlena', 'good', 'what', 'However', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'Walk', 'Line.In', 'end', 'movie', 'rent', 'liked', 'can', 'always', 'buy', 'later', ""'m"", 'sorry', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'harsh', 'rating', 'only', '3', 'stars', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'minority', 'here', ""'m"", 'trying', 'be', 'honest', 'review']",Water for Elephants
1381423,A317VHIH59WE32,B0041KKYHE,I Wasn't Here,"[4, 14]","2 1/2 stars.This could have been a lot better. I read the book before I saw the movie, and although I don't think the book is a great piece of literature, it was still entertaining enough and should have had a worthy adaptation. Now, if you haven't read the book, you'll probably end up liking the movie more than if you had, because if you've read the book, then you'll see all the places they got it wrong in the movie.For one, they should have kept Uncle Al. I get it, though. You can only pack so much into a two-hour movie. Things must be altered. A lot of things were different. They got to some of the same plot points by different means than in the book, which lessened the impact. I wish they had been more faithful.The cast, for the most part, was good. Christoph Waltz was the real star. He was the one my eyes were glued to. He's definitely the best actor in this.Reese Witherspoon surprised me, but in a good way. I like her as an actress, but I thought she was miscast, which she certainly is. Marlena is supposed to be around 21-years-old with light brown hair, and instead we get 35-year-old Reese with a platinum blonde wig stuck to her head. But it mostly worked. I actually liked her enough in the part. Plus, she and Christoph worked well together. I still think they should have gone for a younger actress who fit the part instead of casting someone for their star-power.Then there's Robert Pattinson. *Sighs, shakes head* I'd love to say he impressed me, but he didn't. For some reason, this surprised me. I guess I was expecting more, but again, he was likely cast because he is uber-famous right now, and that often trumps talent in terms of casting choice. The only movies I've previously seen him in are Harry Potter (I barely remember him in it, to be honest) and How To Be, which was a dud.As it is, he is one of the worst things about this film. He spends a good part of the movie either smiling like an idiot or staring like an idiot, and when he's not doing that he's still not proving his acting chops, especially next to skilled actors like Christoph Waltz. His chemistry with Reese is almost completely nil, although that's not their faults. The lack of sizzle between them doesn't make the movie a disaster, but it takes it down another notch. But Pattinson's performance brings it down even more.Hal Holbrook is old Jacob. He's barely in it, though. He should have at least been the narrator throughout the film instead of Pattinson, who lacks a compelling voice and whose American accent is somehow wrong.In the end, it's an okay film. There are definitely some beautiful moments, the animals are lovely, the scenery is good, and at times it creates a nice, nostalgic feeling, but with a mediocre lead actor and a lot of cut corners, it fails to leave an impact.It's worth watching for the animals and Christoph Waltz, who I'm getting a little crush on, but the movie as a whole could have been much more.",2,Could Have Been Better,1304467200,"05 4, 2011",2011,2942,"['2', '1/2', 'stars.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'read', 'book', 'saw', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'book', 'great', 'piece', 'literature', 'was', 'still', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'worthy', 'adaptation', 'Now', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'liking', 'movie', 'more', 'had', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'then', ""'ll"", 'see', 'places', 'got', 'wrong', 'movie.For', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'Uncle', 'Al', 'get', 'though', 'can', 'only', 'pack', 'so', 'much', 'two-hour', 'movie', 'Things', 'must', 'be', 'altered', 'lot', 'things', 'were', 'different', 'got', 'same', 'plot', 'points', 'different', 'means', 'book', 'lessened', 'impact', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'faithful.The', 'cast', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'good', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'was', 'real', 'star', 'was', 'one', 'eyes', 'were', 'glued', 'definitely', 'best', 'actor', 'this.Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'surprised', 'good', 'way', 'like', 'actress', 'thought', 'was', 'miscast', 'certainly', 'Marlena', 'supposed', 'be', '21-years-old', 'light', 'brown', 'hair', 'instead', 'get', '35-year-old', 'Reese', 'platinum', 'blonde', 'wig', 'stuck', 'head', 'mostly', 'worked', 'actually', 'liked', 'enough', 'part', 'Christoph', 'worked', 'well', 'together', 'still', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'younger', 'actress', 'who', 'fit', 'part', 'instead', 'casting', 'someone', 'star-power.Then', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', '*Sighs', 'shakes', 'head*', ""'d"", 'love', 'say', 'impressed', 'did', ""n't"", 'reason', 'surprised', 'guess', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'again', 'was', 'likely', 'cast', 'uber-famous', 'right', 'now', 'often', 'trumps', 'talent', 'terms', 'casting', 'choice', 'only', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'previously', 'seen', 'are', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'barely', 'remember', 'be', 'honest', 'Be', 'was', 'dud.As', 'one', 'worst', 'things', 'film', 'good', 'part', 'movie', 'smiling', 'idiot', 'staring', 'idiot', 'when', 'not', 'doing', 'still', 'not', 'proving', 'acting', 'chops', 'especially', 'next', 'skilled', 'actors', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'chemistry', 'Reese', 'almost', 'completely', 'nil', 'not', 'faults', 'lack', 'sizzle', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'disaster', 'down', 'notch', 'Pattinson', 'performance', 'down', 'even', 'more.Hal', 'Holbrook', 'old', 'Jacob', 'barely', 'though', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'been', 'narrator', 'film', 'instead', 'Pattinson', 'who', 'compelling', 'voice', 'American', 'accent', 'somehow', 'wrong.In', 'end', 'okay', 'film', 'are', 'definitely', 'beautiful', 'moments', 'animals', 'are', 'lovely', 'scenery', 'good', 'times', 'nice', 'nostalgic', 'feeling', 'mediocre', 'lead', 'actor', 'lot', 'cut', 'corners', 'leave', 'impact.It', 'worth', 'watching', 'animals', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'who', ""'m"", 'getting', 'little', 'crush', 'movie', 'whole', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more']",Water for Elephants

1381438,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0041KKYHE,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[8, 12]","Water for Elephants is an old-fashioned, Depression-era drama that functions as a throwback to the Golden Age of Hollywood in that it's a rare Hollywood film that allows its characters to lead events rather than events lead its characters. It's an old clich&eacute; to say ""they don't make movies like this anymore,"" but it's a rarity to see a film like this come out of Hollywood, especially in such close proximity to the season of the summer blockbuster. Based on the acclaimed (and unread by me) novel by Sara Gruen, the film is directed by Francis Lawrence, whose previous directorial credits include Constantine and I Am Legend, who proves himself a worthy director as he's managed to direct an elegant film and pull a surprisingly effective performance from his star Robert Pattinson.Opening in what I can only assume is present day, an elderly man (Hal Holbrook) leaves an elder-care facility to see the circus, but arrives at closing time. He strikes up a conversation with one of the workers (Paul Schneider) and begins telling his story, taking us all the way back to 1931. 23-year-old Jacob Jankowski (Pattinson) is a Cornell student, forced to quit school and leave his home when his parents die in a car accident. After jumping onto a passing train Jacob is hired as a vet for the Benzini Brothers Circus, which is run by the diabolical August (Christoph Waltz). August is a wild-card, a person who doesn't think twice about throwing people from the train when they're no longer of use to him. The star attraction of his show is his wife Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) and, because this is a romance, it's no surprise that Jacob is instantly captivated by her. In an attempt to make a name for his circus, August is looking for a new attraction; something that will get people's attention and make his show more famous than the more successful Ringling Brothers circus, which he loathes. August finds his solution and buys an elephant, which brings his show more fame while bringing Jacob and Marlena closer together.Water for Elephants follows a familiar template that doesn't allow much in the way of surprise. There's an aura of tragedy that hovers over the film from the first scene, much of it is predictable, and it goes for easy emotional punches that are still effective. While it doesn't take many risks with the story, it utilizes strong, almost magical art direction and frequently brilliant cinematography to evoke a convincing time and place. The production design by Jack Fisk is stunning, particularly within the circus; it's dirty, run-down, yet beautiful and the other locations are designed with an equally creative hand. The film is majestically shot by Rodrigo Prieto, who is probably most responsible for the old-fashioned, eloquent beauty of this film. Complementing the tone further is James Newton Howard's score which sacrifices subtlety in favor of being strikingly lovely.The three principal actors are both riveting and underwhelming. Witherspoon gives one of her strongest performances, yet seems miscast. She's pretty enough, she has the acting chops, but she doesn't fit the mold as well as Waltz and (I can't believe I'm saying this) Pattinson do. Meanwhile, Christoph Waltz effortlessly alternates from charm to menace, displaying remarkable range. At first, August doesn't seem far removed from Waltz' Oscar-winning performance as Hans Landa, as the characters share some obvious similarities, but there's a much broader range of emotion that Waltz convincingly portrays in this film that sets the two apart. August is a great character, not a typical one-dimension ""villain,"" and this allows Waltz to perfectly capture the rage, jealousy, determination, cunning, and insanity that characterizes August. Quite honestly, Waltz is a revelation.The much-criticized Robert Pattinson, an actor both loved and loathed around the world, takes a break from ""Team Edward"" to portray Jacob and actually seems set on proving himself as an actor. His performances in the Twilight movies are forced, unconvincing, and unenthusiastic. It's nice to see that Pattinson can actually convey emotion without looking like he's about to vomit. It says a lot about the poor quality of those movies that this is the first time I've seen Pattinson have chemistry with a woman. Pattinson and Witherspoon have been criticized for lacking chemistry, but I disagree with this widely-accepted critique. Pattinson handles downtrodden chemistry better than the ""sparks flying"" sort and there's a distinct longing between the two characters that is quite convincing. I encourage anyone who doubts Pattinson to pay attention to his face throughout the film and the way he responds to various events. There is a real actor there.Water for Elephants is emotional, effective entertainment that is both graceful and delicate, while neither inspirational nor offensive. It lacks a certain spark, a certain creativity that keeps it from being a great film, but it's extremely well-made and, at many times, stunning. It's nice to see Hollywood actually take a chance on something that isn't an obvious money-maker with its character development, Depression-era setting, and lack of action sequences. Simplicity and familiarity aside, Water for Elephants stands apart from the typical romantic Hollywood dreck with great characters, a great setting, a simple, accessible love story, and the handling of this material by a talented, capable director.GRADE: B+",4,A Nice Throwback to the Golden Age of Hollywood,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,5462,"['Water', 'Elephants', 'old-fashioned',

When I heard Robert Pattinson was playing the role of Jacob, I was simultaneously excited and disappointed.  Pattinson will always be Edward Cullen for me.  Just like Daniel Radcliffe will always be Harry Potter, I'll never be able to objectively view Pattinson in any other role.  I watched Remember Me, and all I could think about the whole movie was that Tyler was how I pictured Edward when he was the vigilante vampire, killing murders and rapists after he was first turned.  Even though Tyler was actually a quite sensitive guy, he was rough around the edges, like I pictured the avenging Edward to be.But I digress---back to Water for Elephants.  I think Pattinson is improving as an actor, and he was very believable as Jacob Jankowski.  He and Reese Witherspoon had good chemistry and I enjoyed watching their relationship develop.  The supporting roles were flawlessly played, especially Camel, Walter and Queenie.My favorite thing about the movie was that it closely followed the book (or at least the book as I remember it).  There were no obvious digressions from the book's plot, something that  made me very happy.The stunts and choreography were excellent.  I don't remember ever going to a circus as a kid, but I when I left the theater, I felt like I'd been to the circus.  One word of warning: if you haven't read the book and you're planning on seeing the movie, it is kind of sad.  The way the circus animals are mistreated really got to me.  I think it was worse for me reading the book, but that may have just been because I was prepared for it upon entering the theater.Overall, Water for Elephants was a great movie and an even better book.

1381460,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0041KKYHE,Mark Turner,"[2, 2]","I wasn't sure what to expect with the movie WATER FOR ELEPHANTS. Was it a circus film? A romance? A heavy handed drama? The result was a combination of all three with a tad less heaviness than I expected. And the combination works to form a touching story.The film opens in the present with an aging man (Hal Holbrook) apparently lost and at a circus. When he's offered help finding his way to the retirement home it becomes apparent he worked once in a circus, the Benzini Brothers Circus, a circus whose history had the worst accident ever. He was there and begins to tell the current circus' owner what happened.Jacob Jankowski (Robert Pattinson) is about to graduate as a veterinarian from Cornell University in 1931 when word reaches him his parents have died in a car accident. With no funds and no inheritance (they mortgaged the house to put him in school), he hits the road in search of work, something not plentiful during the Depression. He hops a train only to find he's jumped aboard a circus train and must pay for his way.The next day an older circus hand named Camel takes him under his wing and shows him how things operate, putting him to work until he can talk to the boss, August (Christoph Waltz). Before he can be tossed off the train, he tells August that he's a veterinarian and can help with the horse he saw earlier limping along.August gives him a chance to help and he looks the horse over under the watchful eye of the star horse rider and August's wife, Marlena (Reese Witherspoon). While Jacob and Marlena see the horse will not survive long, August wants to keep it performing till it keels over. Jacob shoots the horse but alter is nearly tossed from the speeding train as August informs him that he is the sole ruler of this group and never to disobey him again.Time moves forward and Jacob learns all the various tricks of the circus while at the same time taking care of the animals. These are hard times and a star attraction is needed to make the show the best there is. Fortune smiles on the group in the form of a leftover attraction from another failed circus, an elephant named Rosie.Rosie and Marlena are to be the top item in the show, but Rosie isn't moving at the speed in learning a routine that August wants. Numerous painful prods with a pike get her moving but also wound her, something neither Jacob nor Marlena approve of. After a show in which Rosie escapes, August beats her to near death. An accident happens when Jacob says something to her in Polish and she understands. This opens the door for a well performing elephant.Beneath all of this is a bit of flirtation going on between Marlena and Jacob that August is unaware of. The combination of romance between two people that almost literally fall into each other's path, the unknown world of the circus and the volatile temper of the man who runs it all make for a romantic drama that could end in tragedy. Only time will tell.Pattinson and Witherspoon will be the draws to this film. Witherspoon for her fresh faced all American appeal and Pattinson for his heartthrob notoriety gained with the series of TWILIGHT films. But each displays a deeper acting ability than their previous films have delivered. While watching this film you forget that its a movie, that these are actors and you feel that it's the story of two people who share something in common that brings them together in a cold, cruel world.Waltz, noted for his evil portrayal of a Nazi commander in Tarrantino's INGLORIOUS BASTARDS, shows that his acting is not a one note talent. While his character is as evil if not more so in this film, it is far distant from the Nazi in the previous. There is a certain amount of sympathy for this character that in the hands of a different actor might not have shined through. But Waltz delivers on the Oscar nominated promise seen before.In all this film harkens back to the old days when movies were larger than life and filled with images of worlds we normal humans rarely had the opportunity to visit with the exception of a few moments in a darkened theater. This is grand old fashioned movie making at its best. It's entertaining, tells a story and is so well made you don't notice that it's even a movie.

I loved the movie; despite any shortcomings others might perceive, I found the script, acting, and cinematography to be in the very good to great range. I thought all characters were well-cast, especially Christopher Waltz, who did an admirable job portraying the mercurial August.I readWater for Elephants: A Novellater. Although I enjoyed the book, this was one of the rare instances in which I found the story on screen to be even better than the printed version, much more engaging and dramatic. The screenwriters managed to flesh out details that needed it while cutting extraneous material. In particular, two main characters from the book were seamlessly combined into one of the lead roles; the end result detracts nothing from the plot and really helps move the story along.Witherspoon is luminescent in her role as a circus performer, and Patterson is an appealing ""first-of-may""; their relationship on screen may not be incendiary, but it is perfectly believable and authentic. Their love affair is really a menage-a-trois, Rosie being the third party; the elephant, naturally, often steals the show on film.The film follows the original book's time structure fairly closely, cutting back and forth between the present, where old man Jacob resides in a nursing home, and his past experiences with the Benzini Brother's Circus. I thought it improved on this point as well, with less attention devoted to the trivialities of life in an old age home; the film's ending,(which I won't divulge),is much more well-explained and believable than the book's finale.All in all, Lawrence and his cast took a fairly interesting story and really brought it to life in this very engaging and close-to-perfect film.

1381465,A3HBE3VAKQ7RYF,B0041KKYHE,"Megan @ Book Brats ""Book Brats Reviews""","[4, 4]","WATER FOR ELEPHANTS follows the same story as the novel, casting Robert Pattinson as Jacob and Reese Witherspoon as his love interest Marlena. The movie stays true to the book, from the characters to the scenes, even taking time to show minor aspects of the book that I thought they would overlook, such as the dwarf and his dog. However, there were so many details of the book forgotten by the movie that made the book special to me, which automatically became a slight nitpick.I really enjoyed seeing the details of the book with my own eyes on screen, from the hierarchy of the roustabouts to the ringmaster and the society these people created for themselves in the confines of the circus. Living in their own society with their own rules, these people got away with a lot, and the movie takes this into consideration. Some of the sexier aspects of the book were overlooked for the safety of a PG-13 rating of course. This didn't detract from the movie in my thoughts.The casting in this movie was great. Although Robert Pattinson didn't bring as much to the table as I had hoped (and I still saw Edward Cullen every moment he was on screen), Reese Witherspoon's performance as a battered wife was amazing, as was Christopher Waltz as her abusive husband. Witherspoon's performance with the animals was especially entertaining - even though I don't know how much she actually did herself, it was very impressing and believable.  The minor characters were also well cast and well performed, bringing to this movie an honesty the book deserved.Even if you previously read the novel, you will not get bored. The movie moves at a great pace and weaves its tale in much the same way as the book, incorporating flashbacks and present day narration from an elderly Jacob.  And the costumes alone are amazing and to die for. If you're a fashion nut like me, you will appreciate that alone.VERDICT: With stunning performances, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS will not disappoint, even with a few small nitpicks here and there.

The cast was fantastic, especially the actors who played the three main characters (Robert Pattinson especially gets props for this role, which should silence any naysayers who claim the ""Twilight"" golden boy can't act). The movie reminded me a lot of the film ""Big Fish."" It was beautiful to watch but was also incredibly character-focused, with elements of fantasy and whimsy.

First, I would put Robert Pattinson's name before Reese but if you are a reader of my blog, you know I love my Pattinson!As someone who has never read Water for Elephants (and I know there are many who did), I loved it!We start with an older man standing in a parking lot. He is asked if he is with the nursing home and taken in until someone can find out where he comes from. He explains he was looking for the circus and starts telling his story....I loved the voice narration of the older Jacob actor and the younger Jacob blending until we are in flashback...Rob's character, Jacob has a loving mother and father who never let their son see how bad the depression was. When they are killed in a car accident, he learns that the bank owns his house. His loving parents mortgaged their home to finance Jacob's education at Cornell. He is so close to graduating and getting his veterinary license but never finishes. He has nothing, his parents are gone and so is his home! He heads out unsure where he is going. A train goes by and he jumps on. Close to being beaten and roughed up he is taken under the wing of a circus worker who promises him work if he can hack it.He is introduced to August the Ring Leader and owner of Benzini Brothers Circus. Christoph Waltz does a fantastic job as the damaged, egotistical, violent ring leader.Jacob passes himself off as a vet and tells August that Ringling Brothers has their own. August hates Ringling Brothers as a struggling circus. Jacob is told he will have a job if he can save the prized, top horse who is ridden by August's wife, Marlena (Reese).  When the horse is put down, Rosie the elephant is purchased.  This gentle giant and Rob steal the show for me.Jacob and Marlena fall in love, it would be hard for her not to, she is constantly thrown at him by her husband. Jacob is the opposite of August. August uses force and Jacob uses gentleness.The scenes are brilliantly lit to create a depressive sideshow feel. You are praying for August to suffer and for Marlena to get away from him. The scenes of two victims thrown from the train were hard not because of the graphic nature but because of the characters. There were also moments of violence toward Rosie that were hard to watch too! The movie made me want to read the book. It is something I will be picking up if I don't have it on my preloaded Kindle (thanks Susan, you are the bestest).You will love this movie even if you are not a Pattinson fan but if you are, you will savor every moment.

Oleson,"[0, 0]","This story opens when an old man (roughly 102 based on my calculations) is standing in the rain between some 18-wheelers and the entrance to a circus. He is played by the great Hal Holbrook. The circus manager (under-appreciated Paul Schneider) brings him into his office. He begins to reflect back on his life in circus in 1931. As his narration begins, the voice changes and Jacob is now in his early 20's and taking his final exams at Cornell University. Young Jacob (must be amusing on the Twilight set) is played by Robert Pattinson. Jacob's Polish parents are killed in an auto accident. Left penniless, he drops out just short of getting his degree in veterinary medicine.Jacob catches a train passing by and it turns out it is a circus train headed to its next town. He is hired on by the owner and ringmaster, August (Christoph Waltz) to help take care of the animals including the horses ridden by his wife Marlena (Reese Witherspoon). Waltz manages to pull off the internal conflict facing August. He is doing his best to keep the circus afloat during the depression and sometimes seems to have the best of intention. At the same time August can be cruel, especially when drinking or provoked. He mistreats his wife, although he loves her. He mistreats his animals (including the star elephant who is bringing in the audience) even though they are his livelihood. He mistreats his employees, even to the extent of tossing them off the train rather than pay them.You can figure out what comes next. Marlena and Jacob start making goo-goo eyes at each other and start dancing after a few glasses of booze and of course get caught by August. Witherspoon and Pattinson look great together especially in formal attire. Unfortunately, something is missing in their romance. There is no passion, no chemistry. Ultimately, disgruntled employees allow the wild animals to escape during a show which dooms the circus's survival, but the lovers begin a long life together.Overall, the story is well told, but does swerve into melodrama a bit too often. The film is beautifully shot and the Blu ray transfer is perfect. Great colors combined with some nice night time scenes really sparkle. The DTS-HD Master Audio is very good, distributing the audio around the room during the action sequences.",3,3 1/2 stars for an imperfect romantic drama,1330732800,"03 3, 2012",2012,2295,"['story', 'when', 'old', 'man', 'roughly', '102', 'based', 'calculations', 'standing', 'rain', '18-wheelers', 'entrance', 'circus', 'played', 'great', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'circus', 'manager', 'under-appreciated', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'office', 'reflect', 'back', 'life', 'circus', '1931', 'narration', 'voice', 'changes', 'Jacob', 'now', 'early', '20', 'taking', 'final', 'exams', 'Cornell', 'University', 'Young', 'Jacob', 'must', 'be', 'amusing', 'Twilight', 'set', 'played', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Jacob', 'Polish', 'parents', 'are', 'killed', 'auto', 'accident', 'Left', 'penniless', 'out', 'just', 'short', 'getting', 'degree', 'veterinary', 'medicine.Jacob', 'train', 'passing', 'out', 'circus', 'train', 'headed', 'next', 'town', 'hired', 'owner', 'ringmaster', 'August', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'help', 'take', 'care', 'animals', 'including', 'horses', 'ridden', 'wife', 'Marlena', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Waltz', 'pull', 'off', 'internal', 'conflict', 'facing', 'August', 'doing', 'best', 'keep', 'circus', 'afloat', 'depression', 'sometimes', 'have', 'best', 'intention', 'same', 'time', 'August', 'can', 'be', 'cruel', 'especially', 'when', 'drinking', 'provoked', 'wife', 'animals', 'including', 'star', 'elephant', 'who', 'bringing', 'audience', 'even', 'are', 'livelihood', 'employees', 'even', 'extent', 'tossing', 'off', 'train', 'rather', 'pay', 'them.You', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'next', 'Marlena', 'Jacob', 'start', 'making', 'goo-goo', 'eyes', 'other', 'start', 'dancing', 'few', 'glasses', 'booze', 'course', 'get', 'caught', 'August', 'Witherspoon', 'Pattinson', 'look', 'great', 'together', 'especially', 'formal', 'attire', 'Unfortunately', 'something', 'missing', 'romance', 'passion', 'chemistry', 'Ultimately', 'disgruntled', 'employees', 'allow', 'wild', 'animals', 'escape', 'show', 'circus', 'survival', 'lovers', 'begin', 'long', 'life', 'together.Overall', 'story', 'well', 'told', 'swerve', 'melodrama', 'bit', 'too', 'often', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Blu', 'ray', 'transfer', 'perfect', 'Great', 'colors', 'combined', 'nice', 'night', 'time', 'scenes', 'really', 'sparkle', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', 'very', 'good', 'distributing', 'audio', 'room', 'action', 'sequences']",Water for Elephants

Rosie is really what the film should center around. Instead we get a lukewarm love story. I really wanted this film to blow me away but alas it turned to be another quick fader.

Set in 1931 during the depths of the Great Depression, a young man, Jacob Jankowski, is just about to finish his veterinary degree at Cornell, when his life crumbles around him after the death of his parents. Destitute, he hops a train to Albany, NY...a circus train for the Benzini Brothers Circus. He passes himself off as a vet to the owner, August Rosenbluth, and is hired as the circus veterinarian. In short order he meets the star of the circus, and wife of the owner, Marlena; and learns the owner is a sadistic brute who abuses his wife and the circus animals and throws employees off the train to keep from paying them. Needing a new performing animal for Marlena after her horse has to be put down, August buys a circus elephant, called a &#34;Bull&#34; in circus parlance, although the elephant, Rosie (Tai) is a female. Initial training efforts are not successful and she is brutally beaten by August. But then Jacob (who is Polish) learns that Rosie responds perfectly to Polish language commands; and the act becomes a huge success. August continues to be abusive, however, and Jacob and Marlena begin to fall in love. Can you see where this is heading...if you are intrigued so far, queue this one up and see how it plays out. British actor, Robert Pattinson is Jacob...another superb performance from this young man, who is developing onto a top drawer performer. Austrian actor, Christophe Waltz, who has had several fine roles since his first American film role in &#34;Inglourious Basterds&#34;, delivers another fine performance here as August; and Reese Witherspoon, adds to her resume of fine performances as Marlena. Tai, the elephant is superb too.

I bought it, but didn't get around to reading it until I was on my way back from Paris. I remember sitting on the bus to Charles De Gaulle airport, reading the first sentence and instantly being hooked. I read most of the book on the plane, and was unable to put it down. Sara Gruen really knows how to craft a story, and does so carefully in the book.And then, about a week later, while waiting for an IMAX showing of Sucker Punch to start, I see a trailer for the upcoming movie. I figured, ""Hmmm, this could work.""Well, I'll start on the good stuff. Starting off, I think the filmmakers did what they could with what I consider to really be an unfilmable book. They stayed true to the source material for the most part, so I can really have no complaints there. In addition, Reese Witherspoon was fantastic and so was Christoph Waltz- He is easily the best actor out there today and really managed to play the sick cookie August well. I was actually scared in some scenes he was on screen.I will also advise people not to let the words ""Robert Pattinson"" scare people away, because he does a pretty good job here, and it's also funny he plays someone named Jacob in this flick. That said he proves himself to be more tan just ""that Twilight guy"" in the movie.However, I must say I found this film to be rather pale in comparison to the book.For starters, Jacob is much younger in the movie than in the book. He's 93 in the book, here he's 80something. And we don't get any signs of his supposed dementia that the book implies he has.Another complaint is that the only character that they stayed true to was August. Kinko seemed way too nice here. In the book, he was this smug and arrogant jerk, who was also a ticking time bomb. He'd FREAK OUT when someone walked in on him having alone time. Here he's just like ""oh hey what are you doing here"". Furthermore, Marlena is reduced to a damsel in distress here. Whereas in the book she was a sweet, nice, and desperate character who's married to a sick puppy, here she's nothing more but a sue and a damsel.Another complaint is that the movie really seemed rushed in comparison to the book. It kinda felt as if they cared more about visual interest and star power as opposed to being a somewhat faithful adaptation.That being said, this movie is worth it for the acting and the visual style, and I guess I can say I enjoyed it for both. Oh, and James Frain's cameo as the caretaker was hilarious!

Robert Pattinson demonstrates that he can act beyond the realm of vampire.  Reese Witherspoon effectively carries the role.  The supporting casts creates a full vision of the story.The sadistic behavior of the circus owner (Waltz) borders on predictable stereotype but the powerful performance by the actor overcomes the rather limited depth of writing regarding that character.  For example, the viewer may easily predict the impending irrational behavior of that character, but Waltz creates such a realistic portrayal that the rather limited writing survives that weakness.

1381500,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B0041KKYHE,RJ Smoove,"[1, 1]","Ever been dragged into a movie that you had no interest in seeing? How many times did you end up liking that movie much more than you expected? I'm happy to say that's what happened to me with Water for Elephants. I wanted to see the other animal movie that came out this weekend, but alas I settled for this one. I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw. The drama was pretty well done. I won't say the acting was spectacular, because it wasn't, but even so, I genuinely cared for the characters. My favorite character was the elephant that the film (novel) is named after. Rosie by far gave the best performance in Water for Elephants. But like I said, I did care for the characters. Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon were quite alright in their respective roles. I read in a review that they had no chemistry. Bullshit.Their relationship advances in a very believable manner. And let's not forget about Hans Landa, I mean Christoph Waltz. He gave a good performance as well. He has this Hollywood villain thing down pat, and I look forward to seeing him repeat it in years to come. The other characters I liked were the old man, Camel (played by Jim Norton), and the little person, Walter (played by Mark Povinelli). They were both very likable, and I believed them whenever they had conversations with Pattinson's character, Jacob. I also hava to say I think the music is this film's strongest aspect. That's not to discredit any of its other aspects though. James Newton Howard has provided a magnificent, albeit simple, score. He never goes for too much with his musical melodies, and it works well. Tension is built and deflated with a few musical notes.Along with the effective score, there is top tier cinematography. This is a beautiful film to look at with its soft, dull, drab colors. The cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto has somehow remained under my radar for some time, but he does fantastic work. I don't quite know why, but this movie just never reaches a level of greatness. It modestly rises above mediocrity, in my opinion, but never gets better than just good. It's obviously melodramatic.

1381502,AE31M52VLKOG6,B0041KKYHE,Robert G Yokoyama,"[9, 13]","Water For Elephants is easily one of the best movies I have seen this year so far.  It is an entertaining film that features an actor and actress who have perfect on screen chemistry.  Robert Pattinson is a veternarian student named Jacob who hops aboard a train after his parents are killed in a car accident. He discovers the train is a travelling circus.  Reese Witherspoon plays a circus performer named Marlena.  She is married to Albert who runs the circus show.  He is played by Christoph Waltz.  I like how the relationship between Pattinson and Witherspoon starts off as friendship and blossoms into a romance. Christoph Waltz has a talent for playing a villain. His only ambition is to pack people under the circus tent.  His character creates a romantic tension in the movie. Hal Holbrook rounds out the cast.  He is the narrator of the story playing the role of older version of Jacob. Holbrook is sentimental and funny in the early scenes of the movie.I am amazed at the kinds of tricks and moves that director Francis Lawrence gets the elephant to do.  There are a few scenes of animal cruelty in the film.  I hope this does not turn people away from seeing this movie.  No animals were hurt in this film.  These scenes are merely staying true to the spirit of the novel.  There are also many scenes in which animals are treated with gentleness and care. Water For Elephants is a film set in 1931 during the Depression.  Composer James Newton Howard captures the spirit of that time with his score. His score is exciting and romantic at times.  The soundtrack also features a song by Bessie Smith entitled ""I Need A Little Sugar In My Bowl"".  This is a sassy blues tune that I have never heard of before. I  absolutely love this song and the entire soundtrack.  Water For Elephants is romantic, funny and dramatic at different parts. This combination makes this movie one of the best I have seen all year.",5,"Water For Elephants is a romantic, dramatic and funny film.",1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,1919,"['Water', 'Elephants', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'so', 'far', 'entertaining', 'film', 'actor', 'actress', 'who', 'have', 'perfect', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'veternarian', 'student', 'named', 'Jacob', 'who', 'train', 'parents', 'are', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'train', 'travelling', 'circus', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'circus', 'performer', 'named', 'Marlena', 'married', 'Albert', 'who', 'circus', 'show', 'played', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'how', 'relationship', 'Pattinson', 'Witherspoon', 'off', 'friendship', 'blossoms', 'romance', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'talent', 'playing', 'villain', 'only', 'ambition', 'pack', 'people', 'circus', 'tent', 'character', 'romantic', 'tension', 'movie', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'out', 'cast', 'narrator', 'story', 'playing', 'role', 'older', 'version', 'Jacob', 'Holbrook', 'sentimental', 'funny', 'early', 'scenes', 'movie.I', 'am', 'amazed', 'kinds', 'tricks', 'moves', 'director', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'elephant', 'do', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'animal', 'cruelty', 'film', 'hope', 'not', 'turn', 'people', 'away', 'seeing', 'movie', 'animals', 'were', 'hurt', 'film', 'scenes', 'are', 'merely', 'staying', 'true', 'spirit', 'novel', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'scenes', 'animals', 'are', 'treated', 'gentleness', 'care', 'Water', 'Elephants', 'film', 'set', '1931', 'Depression', 'Composer', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'spirit', 'time', 'score', 'score', 'exciting', 'romantic', 'times', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'song', 'Bessie', 'Smith', 'entitled', 'Need', 'Little', 'Sugar', 'My', 'Bowl', 'sassy', 'blues', 'tune', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'absolutely', 'love', 'song', 'entire', 'soundtrack', 'Water', 'Elephants', 'romantic', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'different', 'parts', 'combination', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'year']",Water for Elephants

1381508,A2Z4NPJ1WAWDE7,B0041KKYHE,R. Zoellner,"[0, 0]","Water for Elephants is a pretty movie, with an air of enchantment and the unreal having been worked into the feel of the music, lighting, and scenery.  It is primarily a flashback, and lit with the happy glow of nostalgia, even though the setting is the Great Depression, and there are some dark moments.  Robert Pattinson may not be my favorite actor, but he was made for his role in this film, and he does as well with the happy scenes as his more usual angst.  Reese Witherspoon glows, and not just because she is often back-lit.  She is all kindness and beauty in a time and place of cruelty and ugliness.  This is the circus as a glittering faade, and in Water for Elephants, more of the darkness behind the scenes is shown than glitter, mostly as expressed by certain characters.Ultimately, this is a romantic movie, without being a comedy, through and through.  Love trumps duty, rises above hardship, and flies in the face of sensibility, and in the end, gets away with everything.  Or at least, that is what one expects from this kind of story.  The main character's survival is guaranteed, of course, by the nature of a flashback, at least, so I am not giving anything away.  I really can't think of anyone I wouldn't recommend watch Water for Elephants, except children.  Even if you don't agree with everything that happens, it will at least make for good conversation fodder and entertain you.  Also, having read the book first, I can say that they did a good job of compressing it into this format, while retaining the overall plot and feeling.  The changes made generally worked well, though I do rather wish they had dyed Robert Pattinson's hair red to go with the book description of his character, just for fun, though I don't think he'd look good as a redhead.I have the version of the Water for Elephants DVD that does not have any special features, so that is a bit of a disappointment.  I do like watching special features, and was hoping to see some historical info on circuses, to go with the theme.  Mostly, though, I was glad that it is finally out on DVD, as I really liked both the book and seeing the movie in the theater.  Water for Elephants is one of those nice little pieces of enchanted film-making that I am glad to be able to have at home to watch whenever I want, which may be often.

She always looks like she's having a good time.  And as always, I wanted to like her in this movie.In Water for Elephants, though, she really doesn't have a whole lot to do--just be The Troubled Wife Attracted to a Younger Man.The Younger Man in question is Robert Pattinson--whoever he is--who shows us the entire dramatic range from A to A.  We don't get a lot from his expressionless face, and his vocalizing isn't any better.Sadly, even the principal story arc seems forced; the setup (a young man, on the doorstep of adulthood, faces tragedy and runs away and joins the circus) seems artificial.  I found it hard to swallow that nobody--absolutely nobody from town, church, or college--offers this kid a helping hand.  Even the banker is cold to the point of being needlessly cruel.Once you deal with that, I guess the notion of joining a rag-tag circus doesn't seem any more far-fetched.  Of course, it's run by a petty tyrant--clearly, this is the days before class-action lawsuits....Now, if you don't see where all this is headed, you've probably not seen more than two or at most three movies.  So let's sum it up...boy meets girl, girl meets boy, girl's husband doesn't approve, girl and boy meet elephant, elephant speaks Polish.  (Okay, I admit I didn't see that coming.)  As for the rest...well, I bet you can take it from there.I found the whole story as devoid of emotion as it is of originality.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[1, 2]","I think Robert Pattinson is going to have a long, steady career after the ""Twilight"" films are complete because he keeps picking winners to star in. I absolutely loved this film. To sum it up, it's about a college student who finds out his parents were killed. Now he has to make ends meet (with no money to support himself since his parents used it to put him through college; talk about mixed feelings) and jumps on a train. Although he didn't intend to run off with the circus, he ended up doing just that. Unlucky for him, one of the stars of the circus is the wife of the guy in charge, and this guy is temperamental to the point of being long overdue for some therapy! Between his temper and Pattinson's character needing to learn how to fight (pronto!), there were moments when I wanted to turn away. My skin boiled a little watching the way the horse and elephant were treated. (Note: I will refrain from the lecture going on in my head about why I hate going to circuses in my adult life and prefer they be human-only events. Also, this is one of the many, many reasons I'm a vegetarian. All right, I'm done.)The film did show how overzealous some circus trainers but did it without turning it into an animal rights film. (They certainly dropped more than enough hints though.) Between the triangle with the wife, the unofficial veterinarian (Pattinson's character) and the psychotic husband, there was never a moment for anybody to get too comfortable. At one point, it seemed like some animals had it easier than the circus cast.I loved this film. I was elated with the way it ended and literally stood up and cheered during the last fight scene.

1381515,A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD,B0041KKYHE,"Shannon L. Yarbrough ""Shannon L. Yarbrough""","[252, 270]","I have to admit that Water for Elephants was a decent representation of the book.  Take into consideration that a movie is never going to give you 100% of the book.  That being said, I was disappointed with the parts of the book the movie left out.  There were lots of little details and nuances that just can't come across on the full screen anyway, although you would have liked to have seen how they would have been portrayed.  Although too numerous to mention and for those who haven't read the book it wouldn't matter anyway, the biggest (for those who have read it) would be the comedic scenes that play out with Jacob in the nursing home.  All of those chapters were completely left out.We open with an old man (Hal Holbrook) wandering into the parking lot of a circus that is packing up and moving out.  A workman comes out to see if he is lost and invites him in out of the rain while the man calls the nursing home.  The old man looks at the old black and white circus photos on the wall and recalls out loud which circuses they are from.  This grabs the worker's attention and he mentions the Benzini Brothers Circus tragedy from years ago.  The old man says he was there and the worker asks him to tell him about it.  We flash back to a younger gentleman played by Robert Pattinson and the movie is played out as a flashback of the old man's story.Although I never would have expected it, Robert Pattinson plays out a perfect Jacob.  That irresistible smile he gets on his face when he's around the animals definitely lets us connect with Jacob the way we wanted to see him connecting with Rosie the elephant. Perfect choice for the part!Christoph Waltz was a decent August, the ring master and circus owner.  I pictured someone larger and darker, maybe more Italian looking, when I was reading the book but August's charm and charisma as a business man, and brutality and harshness as a monster, really made him a different type of character that readers will both appreciate and despise.  We really see him on the verge of snapping and just how quickly it can happen.  There is one scene where he becomes angry with Rosie that really sets that uncomfortable tone you get from him in the book.Reese was Reese, what can I say.  She's beautiful to look at, but just not as sexy and alluring as Marlena comes across sometimes in the book.  Still a decent performance from her though and she and Robert make a cute couple.Speaking of sex, there's a lot of it in the book including a strip tease tent in the circus. Those scenes are in the movie, but treated with dignity and careful camera angles - obviously allowing this movie its PG13 rating.  It drags in places where we have to witness the slow glances and connections being made between Jacob and Marlena.  August's discovery of the two is a bit rushed, but after that the action picks up making the last half of the movie pretty solid.  The sad redlighting treatment of circus workers being thrown from the train out of spite and to lighten the financial load is there, balanced with a breathtaking scene of Jacob and August walking across the top of the train in motion.  And then there's old Rosie, and you can't help but smile along with Jacob at the gentle beast when she performs or is providing comedic relief.Non-book readers might find the movie a bit slow at times but will enjoy it overall.  After all, we each have our own favorite circus act, right?  Some book lovers will certainly be disappointed, but if you try hard to approach the movie with a different set of eyes (and lower your expectations just a tad) you will be well entertained.

Suits and pretty dresses. The film succeeds in putting on a show. Was I entertained? Sure. But the movie fails in the same ways the book did - it lacks meaning. The main character, Jacob, played decently by Robert Pattinson, is a failed vet student with little drive. Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) is the woman he loves. Her husband, August (Christoph Waltz), is a cigar-smoking tyrant. In other words: none of this is Earth-shattering, but it should be. The setting of both the film and book are masks for a severe lack of narrative ingenuity. Considering the setting, you want the story to be grand, but it's merely show. Think Titanic without Jack's passionate attempts to save Rose, or Rose's fierce desire to escape her status. Jacob, Marlena, and August are missing that spark, and the actors did the best they could with the one-sided characters put on the page. The movie's certainly not a waste. Rosie the elephant is a delight, and Robert Pattinson's face lights up far more for her than it does for Marlena. There are some good laughs, and plenty of music.

I was not disappointed and was actually surprised with the Blu quality and features.The story leaps between Depression era circus life and brief modern day flashbacks of an old man lost at a just-finished big-top. All of the performances were standard, with Waltz stealing the quality scene time from everyone else. The story was entertaining, sad and made to be believable from each perspective (good and bad). Animal lovers will have some difficulty getting through some of the scenes, but at least the filmmakers did not sugarcoat how the animals were treated back then.The Blu clarity actually shined through, and with so many CGI sequences there were plenty of chances to fail. The nighttime shots on top of the moving train showed inevitable lighting weaknesses, but they still provided a sufficient scope. Otherwise, the colors and line definition shine brilliantly, especially in Reese's scenes and the with amount of vivid close-ups for every actor there should be no question how every speck of makeup looks. The 5.1 DTS is tested frequently with the train shots - which vary widely depending on the indoor or outdoor mix.The talking-head supplements are worth the time, especially the one covering the elephant participation/actress bio. In watching that particular one you begin to realize how many green screens were behind the actors (and elephant) through most of the film. They total an hour but if you liked the film and want more info, especially for the large volume of detractors that are upset with the book-to-film translation (watch the Page to Screen docu) then I think these will be worth the investment.

1381533,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0041KKYHE,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 10]","America. The Great Depression.Jacob (Robert Pattinson) sits down to take his final exam, the last step to becoming a vet, when he receives some bad news. Both of his parents were killed in a car accident. Reeling, he flees his small town and follows the train tracks. He hops on the first train and as luck would have it, he has hopped the Banzini Bros. Traveling Circus. Camel (Jim Norton), an aging roustabout, becomes his official guide and guardian, getting him settled in with the circus. The next morning, Jacob gets some work but his eye wanders to Marlena (Reese Witherspoon), the star of the show. When one of her trained horses becomes sick, Jacob offers to help and attracts the attention of Auguste (Christoph Waltz, ""Inglourious Basterds"", ""The Green Hornet""), the owner of Banzini Bros. He is also Marlena's husband. Jacob does some fast talking and quickly becomes the circus vet. But Marlena needs a new act and Auguste finds her a trained elephant. As the vet, the elephant's care and training falls to Jacob. He and Marlena spend a lot of time together and an almost inevitable chemistry grows between them. But Auguste has difficulty dealing with the stress of the circus and his growing jealousy.""Water for Elephants"", based on the bestseller by Sara Gruen, is a very beautiful film with a very old-fashioned narrative and visual style. This isn't a criticism. In fact, this old-fashioned style only seems to allow us the time and energy to focus on the characters and story. And this makes both even more powerful and memorable.At the end of the film, the first credit was for director Francis Lawrence. I didn't recognize the name at the time, but I was impressed. The second credit was for writer Richard LaGravanese, which didn't surprise me at all. In Hollywood, there are maybe a half dozen screenwriters who are attached to just about every weighty, serious and 'award worthy' film. LaGravanese is one of those writers. He crafts superb screenplays allowing the director and actors to get a jump start on creating a high quality film.A few days after watching ""Elephants"", I was going through some old reviews I wrote and a familiar name popped up. Francis Lawrence. As a director, he got his start working on high profile music videos. His first feature film? ""Constantine"" starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who is fighting the Devil in modern-day Los Angeles. (Aren't we all?) His second film? ""I am Legend"" starring Will Smith as one of the few survivors of a worldwide pandemic now fighting against vampire-like creatures to stay alive. His third film? ""Water for Elephants"". I then understood why I didn't recognize the director. His first two films (""Legend"" is the better of the two) are so different from his newest. With the exception of a couple of landscapes created with CGI, I would venture to guess that 99% of ""Elephants"" is special effects free. The opposite is true of ""Constantine"" and ""Legend"", both of which are chock-a-block with CGI. In ""Elephants"", Lawrence doesn't have any special effects to deal with, so he is able to concentrate his time and attention on the characters, creating a rich, interesting, visual film.The film begins with Old Jacob (Hal Holbrook) wandering into a modern traveling circus. The manager (Paul Schneider, ""Bright Star"", ""Lars and the Real Girl"", TV's ""Parks and Recreation"") invites him in and they start talking about Banzini Bros. and his early life. We enter this exotic world because of Jacob. And it is a good fit, because he is as young and impressionable as we are; he is our guide to this world and we are meant to see and experience what he does.As Old Jacob begins to tell his story, the narration quickly dissolves to Jacob (Pattinson) narrating. After the death of his parents, Jacob finds he has little left in the world and flees his small town by following the train tracks. Soon, a train approaches and he decides to catch a ride. The next day, Banzine Bros. sets up in a new town and Camel gets him a job shoveling the horse manure. He soon attracts the attention of Auguste, the tyrannical owner and ringmaster of the circus. Auguste orders him thrown off the train. But Jacob quickly convinces him he should have a vet. Ringling Bros. does.I know why Robert Pattinson was cast in this movie. You know why he was cast in this movie. The filmmakers hope his enormous ""Twilight"" fan base will help make this movie a hit as well. So far, none of the ""Twi-hards"" have helped any non-""Twilight"" movie starring Kristen Stewart or Pattinson become a hit. So it seems a shame they didn't go with Emile Hirsch or Andrew Garfield, two of the other, better actors who were considered for the role.That said, as I watched ""Elephants"", I was in turn, surprised and perplexed by Pattinson. Initially, his portrayal of Jacob looks and feels interesting and complex. When he learns his parents have died, he is naturally upset. Further complications cause him to run away and literally join the circus. Once there, he is awed by the beauty and the spectacle, he is intimidated and frightened by the danger, he is happy to be working with the animals. But as the story continues, these emotions seem to recycle. Worse, his portrayal of these emotions seems to be the same each time. While I was happy to see him going beyond the glowering teen-angst he has perfected for ""Twilight"", the use of the same three or four facial expressions proves his limited range as an actor.Reese Witherspoon plays Marlena, Auguste's wife and the star attraction of Banzini Bros. Witherspoon fares much better and portrays a mixture of love and fear of her husband, her stardom and her circus skills. Resembling Jean Harlow, she conveys a mixture of strength and vulnerability any actress in the 30s might have possessed to make them a star. At times, she seems to love Auguste and also to fear his temper. But she has been with him long enough to know how to calm her husband and bring him back to Earth.The morning after Jacob jumps the train, the circus arrives in a new town and sets up. That afternoon, Jacob gets his first glimpse of Marlena's act as she rides her trained horses. And because we are watching through his eyes, it is our first glimpse as well. It is easy to see why he is won over by her beauty as well as the beauty of her act; it is hard to deny the majesty of trained horses moving in harmony. When something happens to the lead horse, Jacob and Marlena are forced to work closely together. And Marlena seems drawn to Jacob because he is so different from Auguste. Jacob is drawn to Marlena because of her maturity and exotic nature.Auguste juggles a lot of responsibility but he also knows he has to rule his kingdom with an iron fist. At times, Auguste is extremely charming and at others, dangerous and menacing. It might seem like he is schizophrenic, but we recognize these different sides of his personality appear as needed, in response to a situation. Waltz is perfect as Auguste. He always seems a little troubled, a little pensive, so when he suddenly turns on the charm, he does so with an underlying sense of danger. One side of his personality never disappears in favor of another and this helps his character seem more dangerous and unsettling.As soon as Jacob enters the picture and convinces Auguste to hire him as the circus vet, Auguste seems a little unsettled, a little less sure of himself. He quickly demonstrates his power by instructing Jacob to do something he doesn't want to do. When Jacob goes against his wishes, his anger surfaces. Later, when Auguste feels Marlena has been threatened, he takes out his aggression on an unsuspecting animal. This is an extremely difficult moment to watch, but it also helps illustrate how dangerous he is. If he is willing to do this to an animal, something that cost him money, and can generate revenue, how will he treat Jacob is he feels threatened by him? Jacob and, for that matter, many of the circus employees, are more expendable than the animals.It is through Jacob that we also witness the examples of how hard this life is. Auguste frequently has money problems. If he feels his employees are becoming too angry about not being paid, he instructs his henchmen to 'red line' some of the more expendable roustabouts. They are basically thrown off the train, in the middle of the night, while it is still moving. And there aren't a lot of feather beds lining the ground along the tracks. When this happens, news spreads and the protests are usually cut off.As the relationship between Jacob and Marlena grows, Auguste recognizes he is losing his love. Instead of banishing Jacob, he brings them closer together, insisting Jacob join them for dinner of many occasions. This helps him keep a more watchful eye on them but also causes his jealous nature to surface much more quickly.Auguste finds an elephant for sale and buys Rosie for Marlena. If she can ride a trained horse, she can ride a trained elephant. And he becomes glassy-eyed at the anticipated revenue. But Jacob and Auguste have different ideas about how to train the new addition and the ringmaster hands the vet a prod with a sharp hook on the end. Auguste is only too willing to demonstrate the tool's use leading Marlena and Jacob to back away in horror.Hal Holbrook plays Old Jacob and his moments at the beginning and end of the film add poignancy making the story a little more touching.""Elephants"" illustrates the best and worst of circus life, showing the romantic vision of why so many would 'run away and join the circus'. Shortly after Auguste hires Jacob, he leads the young man to the roof of the train and they walk across the top of many cars. Then, Lawrence shows us a wide shot of the train traveling down a curved track through a lush countryside and a small town. A river winds through and the moon shines down. This shot is really beautiful (and no doubt created with CGI) and helps to establish the romantic vision of living such a life.The attention to detail carries through to the design of the train cars. Auguste and Marlena travel in an opulent, red velvet lined car while others travel according to their importance.Old-fashioned storytelling, great visual style and some memorable performances all help to make ""Water for Elephants"" a very good film.",4,"Beautiful film, good adaptation & Robert Pattinson",1305504000,"05 16, 2011",2011,10299,"['America', 'Great', 'Depression.Jacob', 'Robert',

I like to see the movies first, so that I'm not disappointed by the the things that are cut out from the book.  First of all, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this story was set in one of my favorite time eras!  From a fashion girl point of view, the costumes are stupendous! Reese is gorgeous & not &#34;cliche&#34; looking for that time period. I love the story, I love the acting & the photography is stupendous!  There's really not that much suspense in the story, but it does keep you interested & there's plenty of drama.  Also, the animals are great! And I was amazed that Reese actually does all of her stunts in the movie!  As for the chemistry between Reese & Robert... I'm not sure I buy it 100% but that also could be because of Pattinson's overexposure as Edward Cullen of Twilight.  This movie was definitely worth the money I paid & more.  The only thing disappointing about the logistics of it, is that I thought I was buying a NEW or Like New (I forget which one I chose) product, and it was clearly gently used.

1381537,A2TXH9QKLD4ZVX,B0041KKYHE,TreyRoo1,"[1, 2]","The story of a Depression-era orphan with an all but completed study from a prestigious university, this film centers around Jacob Jankowski. First seen as an elderly man (Hal Holbrook) Jankowski was studying to become a veterinarian when his parents died in debt after exhausting their savings to pay his tuition. With no home or money to complete his studies, Jankowski (as a younger man played by Robert Pattinson) simply abandons his home, studies, and life in search of employment. This search ended when he hopped a train utilized by the Benzini Bros. traveling circus.After a brief stint shoveling excrement, August Rosenbluth, the man in charge, hires him as Benzini Bros. own Cornell educated veterinarian. Rosenbluth is played by Christopher Waltz who soon proves to be just as evil as he was when he was playing an SS officer. His long-suffering wife is played by Reese Witherspoon who is the star of the big top with her equestrian act and with a similar elephant act. But when the act struggles to take shape in the beginning, Rosenbluth demonstrates the brutality lying beneath his charismatic show persona by viciously attacking the elephant. He later appears sickened by his actions, but Jacob is certain he'll repeat them and determined to prevent that from happening.In developing the act, Marlena (Witherspoon) and Jacob become attracted to each other. While trying to keep their relationship a secret, they're eventually found out. This and other tensions arising from the shows continuing financial struggles eventually boil over in the form of an employee insurrection, the result of which was alluded to in earlier scenes with the older Jankowski.Whether Titanic started it or simply solidified it, Leonardo DiCaprio became the dream of teenage girls everywhere thanks to the James Cameron opus. And, as a result of that and a genuine dislike for the story and the film, I have hated DiCaprio ever since. He's made, for the most part, quality films ever since and I'm convinced he's so not for his career but simply to annoy me. Others would argue he has no idea who I am, but I feel that's immaterial.Pattinson, thanks to the Twilight series, finds himself in a similar position. With this and Remember Me he seems intent on making quality films to annoy me. Witherspoon and Waltz, while not demonstrating great range with these roles, are more than adequate. The story is engrossing, the scenery spectacular, and the ending is satisfying (though I understand the book version was far more dramatic).

When a tragic event befalls his family, Jacob jumps on the circus train that happens to be passing nearby. The train belongs to The Benzini Brothers, a traveling circus troupe, and there Jacob meets beautiful Marlena (Reese Witherspoon), star performer and wife of the sadistic circus owner August (Christoph Waltz).The romantic film starts out rather slowly, with a ""frame story"" of an old man played by Hal Holbrook, recounting his memories. Things get interesting when Christoph Waltz's character steps in. The two leading players Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon deliver solid performances, but they generate surprisingly little chemistry. Some of the interesting characters in the circus troupe disappear unceremoniously later in the film, which looks rushed as it wraps up.Probably the real stars of ""Water for Elephants"" are the production design of Jack Fisk (""There Will Be blood""), the crisp photography of Rodrigo Prieto (""Brokeback Mountain""), and of course the wonderful elephant Rosie.

Ironically, splicing in the parts at the rest home (you know a place where people are DYING!) would have ""livened"" up the pace a bit!

1381544,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B0041KKYHE,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[5, 15]","Not having read the novel, I cannot make a comparison of Francis Lawrence's film of Water For Elephants to Sara Gruen's best-selling novel, so any comments I make are solely relating to the film.  This is a film that could have been wonderful. You can see it in moments where it truly transports you to a different place and time, to a different world - the golden age circus - whose very existence was dependent on allure and illusion.  The thing is, they're only moments, and they are just not enough of them to sustain the movie, even with the sweetly evocative score by James Newton Howard.To first give you the general plot, in Depression-era American of 1931, Jacob (Robert Pattinson) is a student of veterinary medicine whose life is thrown for a loop by family tragedy on the very day of his final exams. Left suddenly adrift, he ends up by a turn of fate getting a job with a traveling circus as a vet for their menagerie of exotic animals.  The circus is owned and run by the charismatic but volatile and abusive August (Christoph Waltz), whose star attraction is his beautiful equestrian/wife Marlena (Reese Witherspoon). A romantic triangle develops which leads to inevitable tragedy.The two biggest problems, for me, were Francis Lawrence's mechanical direction and Robert Pattinson's one-note acting (and his pointless and emotionless narration that hangs over the film like a suffocating miasma).  Whoever chose Lawrence to direct this film should be shot, particularly given that his prior experience as a director consists of a handful of music videos, the atrociously bad Constantine (2005) and the awful remake of I Am Legend (2007).  His direction is mechanical and consists largely of trying to keep the camera focused on Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon as if desperate to capture even a tiny spark of chemistry between the two, of which there is sadly none. As for Pattinson, the man is passivity personified and his one-facial-expression presence is a leaden drag throughout the film.  And it's made all the worse by the presence of people in the film who actually _can_ act and by contrast only highlight his limitations.Christoph Waltz, on the other hand, is brilliant as August, the mercurial and tyrannical ringmaster/owner of the circus Pattinson's Jacob falls in with. Waltz almost doesn't even _need_ dialogue; with the slightest shift in his expression, he communicates volumes in an instant.  Reese Witherspoon is sympathetic as his wife and star performer, Marlena, but while she sparkles like a circus spangle in the air, she never quite seems comfortable in her role on the ground, in no small part because most of her scenes are with Pattinson where she has to try and convince the audience that she's attracted to the blandly stupid look he always seems to have on his face.  The supporting cast is quite good, with particularly moving performances by Jim Norton as the aging alcoholic roustabout Camel who befriends Jacob, and Mark Povinelli as the dwarf clown Kinko (""My real name is Walter""), in many ways one of the most intriguing characters in the movie which I suspect must come from having had a greater role in the original novel.But in many ways the heart of the movie is really Rosie, the elephant that the circus picks up and who becomes the catalyst for the events that drive the story towards its tragic climax.  One scene in particular sticks in my mind that exemplifies both the moments of grace and beauty that make the film soar and the problem that keeps dragging it back down again. In the scene, Rosie is tethered by a chain to a stake in the ground inside a tent, and a short distance away is a pink lemonade vendor's cart. As Jacob watches, Rosie uses her trunk to pull the stake out of the ground, allowing her to walk over to the cart, get herself a trunkful of pink lemonade, and then return to her original tethering spot, replacing the stake back into the ground, then proceding to look completely innocent (""Someone drank the lemonade? Don't look at me. I was staked here the entire time.""). Showing in that one instance not only more intelligence and personality but more initiative than Pattinson's excrutiatingly passive Jacob displays in the entire movie.Another good aspect of the movie are the bits where it immerses you in what circus life was like for the performers and the crews, how they lived, how they worked, the social strata that existed within the circus and the differences in status dictated by the roles you played. One of the best scenes is where the circus arrives in a new town and you watch as it disembarks from the train and townspeople come to watch the crews unloading the gear and assembling the big top in a bare field, a show in and of itself. I also liked the way they showed a matinee performance where the sunlight lit up the canvas inside the tent, something most people never get to see these days when most circuses perform in enclosed stadiums or arenas. The movie also gives you a good feel for the kinds of problems a traveling circus faced, particularly during the Depression, when animals had to be fed and a circus that couldn't get to the next town was finished, its bones left to be scavenged over by other surviving circuses.Recommended for anyone who loves all things circus and can put up with the parts where Pattinson drags the film down, and anyone who wants to see another mesmerizing performance by Christoph Waltz (if only to erase the memory of his previous one in the truly awful adaptation of The Green Hornet).",3,A film that could

Director Frances Lawrence has taken Sara Gruen's novel 'WATER FOR ELEPHANTS' and transformed it it into a classic romance for this decade.  The similarities to Director James Cameron's 'TITANIC'- 1999 is incredible with the wayward waif falling for the unhappy wife of a tragic marriage and having a circus going under just as the sinking ship falls prey to the iceberg.  Robert Pattinson shows his acting chops playing a modern day Gary Cooper to Reese Witherspoon's Jean Harlow type character and Christoph Waltz shatters the screen with his villainous performance echoing Billy Zane from 'TITANIC' but owns the film along with Pattinson making it a unique experience. The venerable Hal Holbrook appears as Pattinson's character to narrate the story arc just as Gloria Stuart haunted the storyline of 'TITANIC' as an older Rose.  Witherspoon actually works with the animals in the film and fills the story with the tragedy and operatic experience that the film evolves into.  The incredibly beautiful photography by Rodrigo Prieto and the always welcome music by James Newton Howard who,in my opinion, is right up there with Jerry Goldsmith as the most consistent composer of the modern age put the icing on this fabulous romantic cake.  It seems that every decade always has a romantic film to its credit and the film history books will definitely have this one included as a tear jerker of the first order and a memorable book to film transfer.  20th Century Fox releases it a nice 2.35 transfer with featurettes on the making of the film and interviews with the actors and also audio commentary with the director and screen writer Richard LaGravenese.

Robert Pattinson (the vampire dude from the Twilight films) stars as college kid who is forced to drop out when his parents unexpectedly perish. It's the depression and there aren't many job opportunities so he joins a traveling circus and ends up being their vet, which is what he was studying in school. He slowly develops a friendship with the main showgirl, played by Reese Witherspoon, who's the wife of the circus owner and ringmaster, played by Christoph Waltz.I love films that involve circuses and carnivals, but -- surprisingly -- there aren't that many and, when there are, the circus is usually just a fairly minor side plot. This isn't the case with &#34;Water for Elephants&#34; as the circus IS the environment throughout.One thing that prevented me from seeing &#34;Water for Elephants&#34; sooner is that it was advertised as a romance (look at the DVD cover), but it's so much more. The best movies mix genres and this is the case with this film. It's really an adventure-drama with elements of romance.The film reminded me of DC's The Shadow comics from the 70s. Issue number 2 from 1973 dealt with a depression-era circus and was drawn by the outstanding Mike Kaluta. This comic had an impact on me growing up; the other Shadow comics did too, but this one in particular. &#34;Water for Elephants&#34; captures the awesome feel of this comic, despite the absence of The Shadow.This is a great film and now ranks with my all-time favorites. It puts you into the world of the depression-era circus. Don't let the fact that it was pigeonholed as a romance keep you from seeing it. It's way more than that.The film was shot in Eastern Tennessee and runs about 2 hours.GRADE: A-",5,Life in the circus during the 30s...,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,1790,"['good', 'way', 'summing-up', '2011', '34', 'Water', 'Elephants', '34', 'less', 'sentence', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'vampire', 'dude', 'Twilight', 'films', 'stars', 'college', 'kid', 'who', 'forced', 'drop', 'out', 'when', 'parents', 'unexpectedly', 'perish', 'depression', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'job', 'opportunities', 'traveling', 'circus', 'up', 'being', 'vet', 'what', 'was', 'studying', 'school', 'slowly', 'friendship', 'main', 'showgirl', 'played', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'who', 'wife', 'circus', 'owner', 'ringmaster', 'played', 'Christoph', 'Waltz.I', 'love', 'films', 'involve', 'circuses', 'carnivals', 'surprisingly', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'when', 'are', 'circus', 'usually', 'just', 'fairly', 'minor', 'side', 'plot', ""n't"", 'case', '34', 'Water', 'Elephants', '34', 'circus', 'environment', 'throughout.One', 'thing', 'prevented', 'seeing', '34', 'Water', 'Elephants', '34', 'sooner', 'was', 'advertised', 'romance', 'look', 'DVD', 'cover', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'best', 'movies', 'mix', 'genres', 'case', 'film', 'really', 'adventure-drama', 'elements', 'romance.The', 'film', 'reminded', 'DC', 'Shadow', 'comics', '70s', 'Issue', 'number', '2', '1973', 'dealt', 'depression-era', 'circus', 'was', 'drawn', 'outstanding', 'Mike', 'Kaluta', 'comic', 'had', 'impact', 'growing', 'up', 'other', 'Shadow', 'comics', 'did', 'too', 'one', 'particular', '34', 'Water', 'Elephants', '34', 'awesome', 'feel', 'comic', 'absence', 'Shadow.This', 'great', 'film', 'now', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'world', 'depression-era', 'circus', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fact', 'was', 'pigeonholed', 'romance', 'keep', 'seeing', 'way', 'more', 'that.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Eastern', 'Tennessee', '2', 'hours.GRADE', 'A-']",Water for Elephants
