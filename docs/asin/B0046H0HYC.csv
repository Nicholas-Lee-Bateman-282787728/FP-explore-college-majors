I brought it in the car with us for our car DVD player and my boys love it!  I have heard the movie over and over again and they laugh constantly.  It first off is an actual Bob the Builder movie so it is long enough for kids to watch straight through (so you can get some housework done) or watch partly and turn it back on later.  The movie is also different because unlike regular Bob the Builder episodes where he is building a particular project, this movie features pirates and a treasure chest!  It of course features all the Bob the Builder great lessons, like teamwork, friendship, and critical thinking.  My boys love it and the parts I have caught do look quite amazing and fun!  I love the new animation and bright colors.  Great movie for any child!",5,Pirates + Bob the Builder = Adorable!,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,846,"['admit', 'have', ""n't"", 'actually', 'watched', 'DVD', 'yet', 'boys', 'have', 'heard', 'brought', 'car', 'car', 'DVD', 'player', 'boys', 'love', 'have', 'heard', 'movie', 'over', 'again', 'laugh', 'constantly', 'first', 'off', 'actual', 'Bob', 'Builder', 'movie', 'long', 'enough', 'kids', 'watch', 'straight', 'can', 'get', 'housework', 'done', 'watch', 'partly', 'turn', 'back', 'later', 'movie', 'also', 'different', 'regular', 'Bob', 'Builder', 'where', 'building', 'particular', 'project', 'movie', 'pirates', 'treasure', 'chest', 'course', 'features', 'Bob', 'Builder', 'great', 'lessons', 'teamwork', 'friendship', 'critical', 'thinking', 'boys', 'love', 'parts', 'have', 'caught', 'do', 'look', 'quite', 'amazing', 'fun', 'love', 'new', 'animation', 'bright', 'colors', 'Great', 'movie', 'child']",N/A

1387706,AD4POAPE9JQCI,B0046H0HYC,Team Fozz,"[2, 3]","This 60 minute Bob the Builder was complete junk.  It was painfully repetitive and made no attempt whatsoever to challenge the intellects of young viewers.  Basically, a pirate--who built their town centuries ago--hid a golden hammer somewhere.  He leaves clues all over town for Scrambler and Spud to follow.  The clues are in ridiculous places, though.  Like a toy shop and museum that certainly didn't exist when the pirate lived there.There doesn't seem to be any problem with Spud stealing artifacts from the museum, and of Bob just accepting the ancient golden hammer as his (shouldn't he have put it in the museum?).Maybe I'm expecting too much, but my four year old was questioning it...  Pretty disappointing.
