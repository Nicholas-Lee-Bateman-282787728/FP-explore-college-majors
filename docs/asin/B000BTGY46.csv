As a matter of fact I turned it off about 10 minutes into his routine.  Epps is quick to let the audience know that he is only working to earn back the money he'd already spent from his first films- I can't imagine that he's broke but anyway that's not why you're reading this review.  A week went by and I decided to give Epps another chance... He is ignorant as HELL but hilarious.  Definitely not your Rock or Chappelle kind of humor, Epps is straight 'gutter'.  Perhaps that is the reason I was first turned off.  When I attempted to watch the DVD again knowing what to expect I have to tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Yes, Epps is a bit slow at times- and this he admits- but having been forewarned I'm sure you'll too enjoy yourself (especially if you are an Epps fan).  On a final note you get both a DVD and CD for your money.",5,"Be Forewarned, Relax & Laugh...",1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,898,"['was', 'totally', 'blown', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'DVD', 'matter', 'fact', 'turned', 'off', '10', 'minutes', 'routine', 'Epps', 'quick', 'let', 'audience', 'know', 'only', 'working', 'earn', 'back', 'money', ""'d"", 'already', 'spent', 'first', 'films-', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'broke', 'anyway', 'not', 'why', ""'re"", 'reading', 'review', 'week', 'went', 'decided', 'give', 'Epps', 'chance', 'ignorant', 'HELL', 'hilarious', 'Definitely', 'not', 'Rock', 'Chappelle', 'kind', 'humor', 'Epps', 'straight', ""'gutter"", 'Perhaps', 'reason', 'was', 'first', 'turned', 'off', 'When', 'attempted', 'watch', 'DVD', 'again', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'have', 'tell', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Yes', 'Epps', 'bit', 'slow', 'times-', 'admits-', 'having', 'been', 'forewarned', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'too', 'enjoy', 'especially', 'are', 'Epps', 'fan', 'final', 'note', 'get', 'DVD', 'CD', 'money']",Platinum Comedy Series: Mike Epps
949560,A9SGUZF3WZ5EH,B000BTGY46,Sixx,"[2, 4]","I was never really a huge fan of Mike Epps. He, like Jim Carrey, only lands roles because people can count on him to make a complete fool out of himself to make you laugh. That works in a comedy movie.So what happens when you take away the script, the supporting cast, and multiple takes to get it right? You end up with Mike Epps: Inappropriate Behavior.I wanted to like it. I tried my hardest to like it and trust me, I will laugh at the crazy ways people die in today's ""horror"" films.....but this dude is VERY corny. He is not like any comic out there....which is a relief becasue I am tired of seeing the same recycled jokes.....but he also ain't that funny.I DID laugh out loud a maybe 3 parts of the whole movie. The first day of school (I'ma KILL em in the morning!! was CLASSIC!!,  the TV talk shows with Montell and Joe Brown, and his real life experience of when he was in the Special Class with the football helmet and the desk bell. Other than that, I really just waited for the joke to be over. That whole ""Bad Boys"" song........if you see the stand up, you will totally understand.I rated the stand up 2 out of 5 stars instead of 1 star because it wasn't ALL corny....just about 94% of it was. Everybody has their own laugh-o-meter so what's not so funny to me may be hilarious to you.

The man just wasn't funny. The jokes were dry and his routine was just flat out boring.
