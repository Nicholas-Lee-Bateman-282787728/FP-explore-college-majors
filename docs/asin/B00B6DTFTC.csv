1622499,A27BN7M1N93SIE,B00B6DTFTC,bozeman1941,"[4, 5]","As a major fan of all things K-On!, I have been waiting nearly 18 months for the English version of this movie; it finally arrived yesterday, and I watched it last night. Suffice it to say, it was well worth the wait!The movie covers the girls of High-school Tea Time's last few weeks before graduation (except for Azusa, who is one year behind the other four, of course). They decide to go on a graduation celebration trip, and eventually settle on London as the destination (although Yui says she would have preferred to go to England, until the others point out that London is in England!). So, in the week following their finals, and before graduation day, they pile on a plane and head for the UK. I won't elaborate on the details, except to say that the story lived up to K-On! expectations, with Azu-nyan being the most together and organised of the girls, in spite of being the youngest. They visit many famous locations in London, all beautifully filmed and then digitally imported into the proceedings. The only complaint I have is that all the Londoners they speak to (in the English dub) sound like Dick Van Dyke did in Mary Poppins; surely they could have got some real Brits in to speak the parts? They really were awful! But that aside, and it is only a minor point, I loved every minute of it; Yui is suitably nutty as usual, and Azusa gets suspicious and paranoid when the others all stop speaking whenever she walks in the room, but actually they are planning a nice surprise for her!The movie offers a somewhat different view of the run up to the girl's graduation than the second series did; it is more light-hearted, and not nearly as emotional as the latter, but great fun, nonetheless. If you are a fan of K-On!, just get it; it's wonderful!One last point; I had puzzled for ages over the actual meaning of the term 'K-On!', but it turns out that it is a contraction of the Japanese word for light music, 'keiongaku' (&#36605;&#38899;&#27005;).

1622501,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00B6DTFTC,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 3]","Fans of ""K!-ON!"" have watched as the band members of Hokago Tea Time: Yui Hirasawa (guitar), Mio Akiyama (bass), Tsumugi Kotobuki (keyboard), Ritsu Tanaka (drums) and Azusa Nakano (guitar) have won fans hearts with their music.  But also watching the band but most of all, the friendships grow from the beginning to the graduation of four of the members from high school.But as the final episodes of the second season gave viewers a glimpse of the concern the four members had for their youngest member and leaving her behind, the animated series kept things simple, yet sweet as we watch the band and friends prepare for graduation but we saw Azusa's side of wanting to do something for her graduating friends and fellow band mates.But with the popularity of the series and how it became a phenomenal hit throughout Japan inspiring video game and merchandise tie-ins, an animated film was released in December 2011 to showcase the final vacation shared by the five band members but what the band members did for Azusa before graduating.The film was a big hit in Japan and now, the animated film will be released on Blu-ray in May 2013 courtesy of Sentai Filmworks.What is ""K-ON!""?""K-ON!"", it happens to be one of the hottest manga and anime series in Japan that has not only done remarkably well in the anime TV ratings (from 2009-2010)  but also have its music top Japan's Oricon music charts!The series has been a phenomenon as it has attracted fans all over the world, those who want to cosplay as the characters, those who want to sing like the characters and those who want to play the music of the characters. Just one look on YouTube and you can see how passionate people are for this series!""K-ON!"" began as a four-panel comic strip written and illustrated by kakifly and the manga would then be serialized in Houbunsha's seinen manga magazine ""Manga Time Kirara"" between May 2007-October 2010. In April 2011, the manga was relaunched on both ""Manga Time Kirara"" and Houbunsha's magazine ""Manga Time Kirara Carat"" with two separate storylines.The popularity of the manga series led to a 13-episode anime TV series which aired in Japan on April-June 2009, an OVA episode in Jan. 2010 and a 26-episode second season titled ""K-ON!!"" which aired in Japan from April through Sept. 2010 and a new OVA released in March 2011.The series would also lead to a Sony PSP music rhythm video game and the film released in Dec. 3, 2011.As for fans in the United States, there was been high anticipation for the anime TV release and the release of the first and second seasons on Blu-ray arrived with plenty of fanfare.As for what ""K-ON!"" means...  ""K-ON!"" is a play on the Japanese word ""keiongaku"" (light music) and the series follows four high school students of Sakuragaoka Girl's High School who are members of the ""keiongaku"" club.The four characters featured thus far in the series are Yui Hirasawa, a naive and clumsy student entering high school who is not entirely sure what she wants to do in terms of extracurricular activities. While she tries to figure out what she wants to do, two other students, Ritsu Tainaka and Mio Akiyama join the keiongaku club to find out that most of the members have graduated and the only way they can keep the club open is if they have four members.Because Ritsu plays the drums and Mio plays the bass guitar, they hope they can find other musicians and form a band.Fortunately, a new member joins the group, Tsumugi Kobobuki, a student from a wealthy family who plays a Korg Triton Extreme 76-key keyboard. Now all they need is one member.While Yui is trying to think of activities to do, she sees a flyer for the keiongaku club and in her mind, she remembers light music as something she did when she was young student in elementary school and so she joins. Meanwhile, the other three members are happy because with a fourth member, the club will stay alive but also the fact that maybe Yui is a guitarist and now, they can start their own band.But Yui is not a musician and if anything, what she loves about the club is the ability to eat desserts and drink tea with the other members but when the three members perform in front of her, she becomes inspired and wants to be a member of the club and be part of the band.The group eventually form the band ""Hokago Tea Time"" and with the help of their band adviser/teacher Sawako Yamanaka (who once was a student at the same high school, attended the same music club and member of the speed metal band, Death Devil), the group gathered the strength to perform in front of a large audience.When they performed, their music eventually captivated a young guitarist named Azusa Nakano, a friend of Yui's sister Ui.Azusa became the fifth member of Hokago Tea Time and the five friends would eventually take part in several live performances but practice together as a band while enjoying sweets and tea inside their band room.And as these band members became great friends and bandmates overtime, by the final weeks of their final year in high school, the band realizes that they are leaving Azusa behind, as she is younger than them and graduating  later on, the band just wants to make things comfortable for her.And the final year of high school played out in the anime television series.""K-ON!: The Movie""....And with the release of the animated film ""K-ON!: The Movie"", the film takes place months before the four members are to graduate.  Both want to experience a vacation together as friends and as a band, but they also want to spend their final time with their youngest band member Azusa, who they worry about and don't want to leave her all alone.So, the group come up with an idea, plan a trip to London along with Asuza, but to come up with ideas of what farewell gift they should give Azusa before the graduate.A fun and music-filled film as the group manages to get lost in London, what kind of adventures will the five experience in the city and will they be able to play Hokago Tea Time music in this country they are visiting?And what final gift will the four members decide to give as a parting gift for Azusa?VIDEO:""K-ON!"" has always been an anime series that is stylishly created but also features beautifully painted art backgrounds. Presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 anamorphic widescreen), one thing that I love to see when it comes to anime series is the attention to detail when covering a modern setting.A lot of TV series tend to not make the backgrounds of a city landscape so detailed and tend to put a lot of recycled trees, dirt and sky but ""K-ON!"", is not one of those anime series. There are scenes and also still images of natural settings that are beautifully painted and added to the series. There is detail for the instruments, for the desserts and I felt that with each episode, aside from the practice room and the wideshot image of their school, there was always something new being featured in terms of location. So, the color palette of the series is full of color and nothing is stale or seemed regurgitated.With that being said, ""K-ON!: The Movie"" expands on the look by much better shading and a really beautiful look of London scenery with beautifully painted backgrounds.  As one can expect for a recent animated film, the Blu-ray release features a colorful palette, vibrant colors, inky black levels and during my viewing, I saw no problems of banding or artifacts.AUDIO:If there was anything that I was critical of ""K-ON!"" in the past was its 2.0 soundtrack for the TV series, but this time around, because this is an animated film, the lossless audio is presented in English and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  It's important to note that I spent most of my time watching this animated film in Japanese but checking both lossless tracks during certain scenes to see how they utilize the surround channels.  For the most part, the music is crystal clear and sounds fantastic in HD.  There are use of surround channels for crowd scenes but for the most part, the film is dialogue and musically driven and sounds fantastic.While I am biased towards the original Japanese voice talent (which I found each to be fantastic with their performance and music vocals), fans who have watched the original ""K-ON!"" TV series releases in the last three years via English dub and enjoyed it, should be satisfied with the animated film.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""K-ON!: The Movie"" comes with the following special features:Minami Tanaka's Dubbing Investigative Recording - (22:38) TBS announcer Minami Tanaka visits voice actresses Aki Toyosaki, Ayana Taketatsu, Minako Kotobuki, Satomi Satou and Yoko Hikasa and each take part in tongue twisters.London Bus and Press Conference at TBS - (19:00) A featurette with the five Japanese voice actresses riding a London red bus to the TBS headquarters to discuss the the film.Navi Show 1-2-3 is K-ON! - (23:59) Featuring TBS announcers Haruka Kobayashi and Sylvia Kato hosting the program and cast interviews with TBS announcer Minami Tanaka.Movie Premiere Event - (21:40) TBS announcer Sylvia Kato and the cast members of ""K-ON!"" at the movie premiere event for ""K-ON!: The Movie"".Director Naomi Yamada in London - (28:59) A featurette on ""K-ON!"" director Naomi Yamada visiting London and her thoughts of the area, while doing research for the film.Good Luck Music Hall - K-ON! Music Hall - (4:43) TBS Anime Meister and announcer Masao Mukai discusses the music of ""K-ON!: The Movie"".Japanese Trailer - (1:38) Japanese theatrical trailer for ""K-ON!: The Movie"".Japanese Teaser - (:41) Japanese teaser for ""K-ON!: The Movie"".Japanese Spots - (2:44) Japanese commercial spots for ""K-ON!: The Movie"".Clean Opening and Closing AnimationTrailers - Sentai Filmworks trailersJUDGMENT CALL:I have been vocal about ""K-ON!"" being one of my favorite anime series, from its combination of humor, music but also fun character interaction and magnificent voice acting of the Japanese cast.In my last ""K-ON!"" review, I wrote about how sad it was to say goodbye to the members of Hokago Tea Time as they graduate and go their separate ways.  While the manga series continued and possibly in the near future, we may see another animated series with the four members as college students and Azusa continuing the tradition of the club in high school, the fact is that there has not been a series that I found so colorful, fun and amazing when it captures all-female band members (which is common to see in Japan) trying to form a band, performing live and just grow with each other as friends.In Japan, you can watch variety TV shows such as ""Gakkou e Ikou"" (Let's go to School) or films such as ""Linda Linda Linda"" and there are many young people who want to play music. And its evident from the various young bands that have come from Japan straight out of high school that have become signed to a major label.While here in the West, there are shows and events that spotlight this, in Japan, its a bit more magnified because these storylines are brought to television, film and manga. There are constant music auditions throughout Japan featuring many young teenagers who want to make it and these auditions are featured on television. Especially female students who create a rock band.""K-ON!"" captures that essence of those female students wanting to create a rock band and the series gives life to those characters and while keeping the stories fun and light-hearted, I was very impressed with how music is integrated into the series. From the instruments featured, the focus on chord progression and hand/finger movements. While there is an anime series such as ""La corda d'oro ~primo passo~"" that does focus on intricacies of instruments and focuses more on classical music, the show is more magical in a sense that a fairy gives the protagonist the power to play the violin.Most often there are dramatic series about girls and guys  ala ""NANA"" or one that is geared towards idol pop such as ""Hummingbird"" and ""Idolm@ster"", but ""K-ON!"" didn't even go that direction, it focused on the music and the friendships with each individual.What ""K-ON!: The Movie"" does with amazing efficacy is to give us a clear look at how the four founding members of ""Hokago Tea Time"" felt about leaving Azusa behind and wanting to do something special for her before they leave.  So, as the TV series focused on the school life of the students, the film features a vacation as the five visit London but also the four wondering what goodbye present to give to Azusa.Not only was the adventure in London entertaining and a lot of fun, the way the film is handled as the group are about to graduate felt much better than the TV animated series, because you can feel the emotion of the four members towards Azusa and what the four decide to give her as a final present.The music for the film is catchy and upbeat and just to hear things in lossless audio is fantastic and the picture quality was vibrant with beautifully detailed backgrounds.But one of the reasons why this animated film is also worth owning on Blu-ray is the amount of bonus features included.  From the TBS Japanese special features to promote the film, featuring fun games and interviews with the Japanese voice talent, there is also the premiere event, the pre-promotional event in Japan and even a featurette with director Naoko Yamada and staff going to London and sharing their thoughts and experiences of the locations they researched and featured in the film.And no, this is not your typical 3 minute special feature, each of these are 20-30 minutes long.  So, you are getting a good amount of special features included on this Blu-ray release, more than what you usually see in anime Blu-ray releases these days, so this release is really jam-packed with ""K-ON!"" awesomeness!Overall, if you are a big fan of ""K-ON!"", this animated film is a must watch, must own Blu-ray release!  A fantastic animated film that fans will absolutely love and a Blu-ray release that is jam-packed with lengthy, awesome special features!5 stars and a Blu-ray release that is not only highly recommended but definitely on our list for one of the best anime Blu-ray releases of the year!",5,"If you are a big fan of ""K-ON!"", this animated film is a must watch, must own Blu-ray

1622502,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B00B6DTFTC,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 2]","The K-On movie takes place immediately after the events in season 2. Before graduating, the original 4 band members decide to do something for Azusa. They make a trip to London, and through a misunderstanding end up playing at a couple restaurants and night clubs. After they return, they write a very sweet farewell song for Azusa. Everything you have come to love about this series still shines in the movie. I believe that this is the end of the K-On story, and I wish it had advanced a little further. Maybe into their college years or their dream of playing at the Budokan, but who knows. There may be more yet to come. I really enjoyed this movie, but felt like it didn't really advance the story at all. That's why I'm not giving it 5 stars. Others didn't seem to think that was the case, but it's just my opinion. I do believe that if you loved the series as much as I did, you will be happy with the movie.

The movie on Hulu, got hooked on it, watched K-On!! on Hulu and then had to watch the first season K-On! somewhere else on the Internet. I liked it so much, I had to buy the whole thing on blu-ray (even though it's pretty expensive compared to other series) so I could watch it in pristine clarity and view the extras. I just now watched again K-On! The Movie blu-ray, and the story has even more depth now that I've watched the series. I can't wait for the rest of my set to arrive so I can re-watch the series in proper order. My only gripe is that the language selection on the blu-ray menu was not working. It was stuck on English and you could not change it through the menu.

1622507,AAGLJJ0OUBO8V,B00B6DTFTC,Tim,"[15, 16]","Alright, those of you looking for a self-contained anime film will be disappointed this was a project that was obviously made for fans of the series. It's pretty much an episode of the series expanded to an hour and forty-five mins. It contains in-jokes from the series and while there is a plot there's no major conflict. In fact, the opening few minutes makes a joke about the lack of real conflict in the film.Now, if you are a fan of the series, this is a dream come true. The characters are all there, most side characters get enough screen time that you get to revisit just about everyone. The plot is partially about the London trip which was discussed in the season 2 OVA, but it's also about writing the song that they will sing to their underclassman as they graduate. It's sentimental, sweet and everything you've come to expect from the series. As a bonus, just about every song in the series is in it at some point.The animation is beautiful, and expands upon the already wonderful look of the series. The London trip is well done, and for those who have been there, you'll be sure to recognize some lovingly recreated sights. There are a few moments of CGI that feel a bit off, but that may just be my personal bias against CGI.The quality of the Blu is wonderful. The animation looks simply breathtaking at times and there are a quite a few special features. As someone who has gotten used to anime discs only containing the opening and closing as special features, this was a treat.In closing, if you're already a fan of K-On season 1 and 2, this is totally worth a purchase. It's a wonderful closing to one of the most fun anime series to come out in years.",5,"For fans of the series, a dream come true.",1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,1674,"['Alright', 'looking', 'self-contained', 'anime', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'was', 'project', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'fans', 'series', 'pretty', 'much', 'episode', 'series', 'expanded', 'hour', 'forty-five', 'mins', 'in-jokes', 'series', 'plot', 'major', 'conflict', 'fact', 'opening', 'few', 'minutes', 'joke', 'lack', 'real', 'conflict', 'film.Now', 'are', 'fan', 'series', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'characters', 'are', 'there', 'most', 'side', 'characters', 'get', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'get', 'revisit', 'just', 'everyone', 'plot', 'partially', 'London', 'trip', 'was', 'discussed', 'season', '2', 'OVA', 'also', 'about', 'writing', 'song', 'will', 'sing', 'underclassman', 'graduate', 'sentimental', 'sweet', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'series', 'bonus', 'just', 'song', 'series', 'point.The', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'already', 'wonderful', 'look', 'series', 'London', 'trip', 'well', 'done', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'there', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sure', 'recognize', 'lovingly', 'recreated', 'sights', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'CGI', 'feel', 'bit', 'off', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'personal', 'bias', 'CGI.The', 'quality', 'Blu', 'wonderful', 'animation', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'times', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'someone', 'who', 'gotten', 'used', 'anime', 'discs', 'only', 'containing', 'opening', 'closing', 'special', 'features', 'was', 'treat.In', 'closing', ""'re"", 'already', 'fan', 'K-On', 'season', '1', '2', 'totally', 'worth', 'purchase', 'wonderful', 'closing', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'anime', 'series', 'come', 'out', 'years']",N/A
