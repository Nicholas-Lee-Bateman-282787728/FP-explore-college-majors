1283032,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B002PLMJ6K,&#308;&#308;,"[92, 96]","Let me start off this review by saying that ""Dancing with the Stars: Dance off the Pounds"" is my favorite DVD in the ""Dancing with the Stars"" (DWTS) series of workout DVDs.  The styles of dance were fun, actual routines were taught as opposed to just unconnected moves in previous DVDs, and I actually worked up a huge sweat!  The choreography was a bit complex, but I really enjoyed the challenge.  Beginners to fitness and dance may be a bit frustrated at first, though.  There is no warm-up, therefore the viewer has to either do his own or just let the beginning of one of the workouts act as the warm-up.  The DVD was divided into the following four parts of the workout:Swing - Led by Kym Johnson, it is the most basic of all the routines.  It's almost an intro to the Jive, which is a style taught later on in the DVD.  I found the moves to be rather easy to follow; although there is really no breakdown of the steps.  It includes moves such as triple steps, rock steps, kick-ball-changes, sailor steps, Charlestons, and many more.  It has quite a bit of hopping of kicking (at a rather slow speed, though), and it will really get the heart rate up.  Kym is very motivating and sweet to the viewer; I like her as an instructor.  This was my least favorite of all of the segments, but I still enjoyed it immensely.Jive - Lacey Schwimmer leads this fast-paced routine.  All of the moves are incredibly fast, and I could easily see a dance novile becoming completely confused and annoyed.  Lacey teaches the moves very quickly and prefers going from the top a lot more than making sure you have the moves.  She breaks down the really fast, complex moves which is something Kym never did..  Moves included are more triple steps, kicks, Charlestons, heel bops, jump steps, and more.  Lacey is very chirpy, so she may possible get on your nerves if you don't like that kind of instructor.  This was my second favorite routine on the DVD.Quickstep - This was the most challenging of all the routines, which may have been partially due to poor teaching by the instructor Dmitry Chaplin.  Don't get me wrong, I really like Dmitry; but he just didn't teach the moves well.  He seems to be better at showing rather than telling.  The moves taught were really fast and sometimes hard, but Dmitry broke most of them down really slowly.  The many break-downs did make my heart rate go down a bit, but I just do the quickstep segment first and let the beginning low cardio segment count as my warm-up.  There is lot of movement in this routine and a lot of jumping steps, as well.  Some of the moves included are the box step, pendulums, knee bops, shuffle hops, and many more.  The quicktep had the most challenging footwork by far but arguably the most fun.Cool-Down - All of the instructors take turns leading the cooldown, which is comprised of many stretches.  Unfortunately, they don't stretch the calves, neck, glutes, or arms that well.  But it does excellently bring your heart rate down.Overall, I thought it was much better than the previous DVDsDancing With the Stars - Cardio DanceandDancing with the Stars: Latin Cardio Dancewhich were both a bit too boring and slow.  Beginners may like those better, though.  I also enjoyed this video much more than its sister DVDDancing with the Stars: Dance Body Tonethat wasn't very effecting in either toning or cardio departments.  I reocommend getting this DVD it if you are a fan of the show, or if you want a fantastically fun, old-school, cardio workout.  Beware if you are a beginner, though, you might not get the steps right away.",5,Fun and cardio!,1259712000,"12 2, 2009",2009,3585,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'review', 'saying', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'Dance', 'Pounds', 'favorite', 'DVD', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'DWTS', 'series', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'styles', 'dance', 'were', 'fun', 'actual', 'routines', 'were', 'taught', 'opposed', 'just', 'unconnected', 'moves', 'previous', 'DVDs', 'actually', 'worked', 'up', 'huge', 'sweat', 'choreography', 'was', 'bit', 'complex', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'challenge', 'Beginners', 'fitness', 'dance', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'frustrated', 'first', 'though', 'warm-up', 'viewer', 'do', 'own', 'just', 'let', 'beginning', 'one', 'workouts', 'act', 'warm-up', 'DVD', 'was', 'divided', 'following', 'four', 'parts', 'workout', 'Swing', 'Led', 'Kym', 'Johnson', 'most', 'basic', 'routines', 'almost', 'intro', 'Jive', 'style', 'taught', 'later', 'DVD', 'found', 'moves', 'be', 'rather', 'easy', 'follow', 'really', 'breakdown', 'steps', 'moves', 'such', 'triple', 'steps', 'rock', 'steps', 'kick-ball-changes', 'sailor', 'steps', 'Charlestons', 'many', 'more', 'quite', 'bit', 'hopping', 'kicking', 'rather', 'slow', 'speed', 'will', 'really', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'Kym', 'very', 'motivating', 'sweet', 'viewer', 'like', 'instructor', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'segments', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'immensely.Jive', 'Lacey', 'Schwimmer', 'fast-paced', 'routine', 'moves', 'are', 'incredibly', 'fast', 'could', 'easily', 'see', 'dance', 'becoming', 'completely', 'confused', 'annoyed', 'Lacey', 'moves', 'very', 'quickly', 'prefers', 'going', 'top', 'lot', 'more', 'making', 'sure', 'have', 'moves', 'down', 'really', 'fast', 'complex', 'moves', 'something', 'Kym', 'never', 'did..', 'Moves', 'included', 'are', 'more', 'triple', 'steps', 'kicks', 'Charlestons', 'heel', 'bops', 'jump', 'steps', 'more', 'Lacey', 'very', 'chirpy', 'may', 'possible', 'get', 'nerves', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'kind', 'instructor', 'was', 'second', 'favorite', 'routine', 'DVD.Quickstep', 'was', 'most', 'challenging', 'routines', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'partially', 'due', 'poor', 'teaching', 'instructor', 'Dmitry', 'Chaplin', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'really', 'Dmitry', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'teach', 'moves', 'well', 'be', 'better', 'showing', 'rather', 'telling', 'moves', 'taught', 'were', 'really', 'fast', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'Dmitry', 'broke', 'most', 'down', 'really', 'slowly', 'many', 'break-downs', 'did', 'make', 'heart', 'rate', 'go', 'down', 'bit', 'just', 'do', 'quickstep', 'segment', 'first', 'let', 'beginning', 'low', 'cardio', 'segment', 'count', 'warm-up', 'lot', 'movement', 'routine', 'lot', 'jumping', 'steps', 'as', 'well', 'moves', 'included', 'are', 'box', 'step', 'pendulums', 'knee', 'bops', 'shuffle', 'hops', 'many', 'more', 'quicktep', 'had', 'most', 'challenging', 'footwork', 'far', 'arguably', 'most', 'fun.Cool-Down', 'instructors', 'take', 'turns', 'leading', 'cooldown', 'comprised', 'many', 'stretches', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'stretch', 'calves', 'neck', 'glutes', 'arms', 'well', 'excellently', 'bring', 'heart', 'rate', 'down.Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'previous', 'DVDsDancing', 'Stars', 'Cardio', 'DanceandDancing', 'Stars', 'Latin', 'Cardio', 'Dancewhich', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'boring', 'slow', 'Beginners', 'may', 'like', 'better', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'video', 'much', 'more', 'sister', 'DVDDancing', 'Stars', 'Dance', 'Body', 'Tonethat', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'effecting', 'toning', 'cardio', 'departments', 'reocommend', 'getting', 'DVD', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'want', 'fantastically', 'fun', 'old-school', 'cardio', 'workout', 'Beware', 'are', 'beginner', 'though', 'might', 'not', 'get', 'steps', 'right', 'away']",Dancing With The Stars: Dance Off The Pounds

The first instructor (swing) was actually GOOD! she broke down the moves within the sequence and they felt accessible and she was motivating. The other 2 instructors who taught jive and quick step were well intentioned and great dancers but clearly were not teachers. I tried each of these sections for about 5 minutes and decided they were a colossal waste of time so I had to jump ship.I give this DVD 2 stars because of the first instructor.

1283035,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B002PLMJ6K,Colleen M. Schneider,"[3, 3]","I tried another of the Dancing with the Stars workouts (Latin Cardio) and though I liked it, I felt like it wasn't as challenging or as fast paced as I would like and that I would tire of the dvd too soon.  When I saw that this one was available I thought I'd give another try since it is geared more toward intermediate/advanced fitness.  I wasn't disappointed.  It is very fast paced, and I had my pedometer on when I was doing the routine.  We are talking 5,000+ cardio steps in approximately 45 minutes.  Now that's my kind of cardio.  A fun dance workout that doesn't feel like exercise, that makes me pour sweat.  Loved it!I felt that the dances increased in difficulty and pace as you progressed, with Quickstep being the most difficult for me.  I haven't gotten all the steps perfected yet but I look forward to being able to really polish up my technique as I practice a bit more.Word of caution: This is not a good dvd if you are a beginner to dance (too fast paced, maybe try another DWTS video, or some of Lisa Nunziella's dance videos, that have excellent sections that really slow the moves down). If you feel you aren't in good shape, this might be too challenging to begin with as it is quick paced and you will get a pretty intense cardio workout. (I work out 7 days a week and have danced since age 9 and I was pouring sweat doing this workout).  If you feel like you have two left feet, also not for you.  You will end up being frustrated, and that is no fun at all.  Start with a beginner workout and then progress up once you feel comfortable with increasing the pace and the choreography. Dance should be fun, so do this when you progress to a more challenging workout.This workout is for you if you have a dance background, are used to fast choreography, are willing to practice a bit before you ""get it"" or for someone that wants to try something new and is in fairly good shape.I borrowed this copy but I plan to buy it.  It is fun, just challenging enough and a heck of a cardio workout.  Best of all, it is dance, and it doesn't feel like a ""workout"" it feels fun.

1283037,A7U9GG09POJ02,B002PLMJ6K,Erin,"[54, 56]","I'm a DVD dance-workout junkie. I buy *everything* dance-dvd, almost. This is the best of the four Dancing with the Stars workouts. It's not modern dance - it's super-cute jive, swing and funky-quickstep. It's a great workout.The first segment is adorable and sweet learning the American dance 'the swing' (triple-step, rock-step, the sailor, etc.). Great intro to what's to come on the dvd. It's not slow either.The second instructor and routine really shines, is a crazy-fun good time; the pace increases as you are taught the taught the international version of 'swing' which is called 'jive' (faster triple-steps, kicks, heel-bops, Big-X step, swivels, the charleston, the Lindy,etc.) High-impact and difficult cardio which can be modified by not doing arms.The last segment is a suave, dressed-in-black quick-step routine that is explained well and, tho different, has the same great dance-flow as the first two parts. Make sure you watch it to the end it just is a sophisticated blast! Great job of teaching old dances with a totally-modern feel! Gene Kelly would approve.I go back to this DVD as a ""serious"" fat-burning workout because it's a smiling good time that really makes you sweat and laugh. It's pure dance-cardio with, again, great flow. You ARE dancing, not aerobics pretending to be dance. Beautiful choreography that works. It's fun, not lame, slow, or dull, if you know what I mean. Just good times, dancin' hard like it's 1920-1945. And, whoa, did they move it back then. The dvd includes the option doing the workouts with music and instruction or just music so you can cut out the chattering once you're proficent and just dance. Love it. Super-fun. Good for beginners and established dancers alike, this is a serious workout worth the $$.(A similar buy is the spectacular ""Dance with Julianne: Cardio Ballroom""  (purchased after this dvd review) which is also fantastically-fun cha-cha, jive, etc,-- another dancer from the Dancing with the Stars franchise.)",5,"Dance Workout DVD fan says ""It's Adorable, Sophisticated, and Fun!""",1260057600,"12 6, 2009",2009,1983,"[""'m"", 'DVD', 'dance-workout', 'junkie', 'buy', '*everything*', 'dance-dvd', 'almost', 'best', 'four', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'not', 'modern', 'dance', 'super-cute', 'jive', 'swing', 'funky-quickstep', 'great', 'workout.The', 'first', 'segment', 'adorable', 'sweet', 'learning', 'American', 'dance', ""'the"", 'swing', 'triple-step', 'rock-step', 'sailor', 'etc.', 'Great', 'intro', 'what', 'come', 'dvd', 'not', 'slow', 'either.The', 'second', 'instructor', 'routine', 'really', 'shines', 'crazy-fun', 'good', 'time', 'pace', 'are', 'taught', 'taught', 'international', 'version', ""'swing"", 'called', ""'jive"", 'faster', 'triple-steps', 'kicks', 'heel-bops', 'Big-X', 'step', 'swivels', 'charleston', 'Lindy', 'etc', 'High-impact', 'difficult', 'cardio', 'can', 'be', 'modified', 'not', 'doing', 'arms.The', 'last', 'segment', 'suave', 'dressed-in-black', 'quick-step', 'routine', 'explained', 'well', 'tho', 'different', 'same', 'great', 'dance-flow', 'first', 'two', 'parts', 'Make', 'sure', 'watch', 'end', 'just', 'sophisticated', 'blast', 'Great', 'job', 'teaching', 'old', 'dances', 'totally-modern', 'feel', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'would', 'approve.I', 'go', 'back', 'DVD', 'serious', 'fat-burning', 'workout', 'smiling', 'good', 'time', 'really', 'sweat', 'laugh', 'pure', 'dance-cardio', 'again', 'great', 'flow', 'ARE', 'dancing', 'not', 'aerobics', 'pretending', 'be', 'dance', 'Beautiful', 'choreography', 'fun', 'not', 'lame', 'slow', 'dull', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Just', 'good', 'times', 'dancin', 'hard', '1920-1945', 'whoa', 'did', 'move', 'back', 'then', 'dvd', 'option', 'doing', 'workouts', 'music', 'instruction', 'just', 'music', 'can', 'cut', 'out', 'chattering', 'once', ""'re"", 'proficent', 'just', 'dance', 'Love', 'Super-fun', 'Good', 'beginners', 'established', 'dancers', 'alike', 'serious', 'workout', 'similar', 'buy', 'spectacular', 'Dance', 'Julianne', 'Cardio', 'Ballroom', 'purchased', 'dvd', 'review', 'also', 'fantastically-fun', 'cha-cha', 'jive', 'etc', 'dancer', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'franchise']",Dancing With The Stars: Dance Off The Pounds
1283038,A27TQA0XCZUXZY,B002PLMJ6K,Feles31,"[0, 1]","I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.  I have minimal dance background (maybe a year or so of non-intense lessons, I have done swing before but not the others) and more martial arts than anything else.The swing and jive were fairly easy to pick up.  The first time I did these routines I did not get as good a workout since I was still learning it but by the second time I tried the vid, I had it down enough for a workout.  You actually do get a decent cardio workout.  You don't notice the time going by because it is fun but the heart rate does get up there and you start to sweat over the course of each approx 15 minute routine.  Instructors, backup dancers, music, and moves were all good.The quickstep is another story.  Perhaps this is a more difficult dance but the choreography was much more difficult to pick up.  I was still struggling to pick up the steps by the second time I tried the vid but had enough of it down that, at the end, when you do the whole routine 2 or 3 times in a row, I could keep my feet moving along even if it was the wrong foot or late sometimes.  If you did the entire routine enough times it would probably be the most intensive workout of the 3, but since most of the first half is done very slowly to teach you the moves and broken out into short segements, you probably will never really get the benefit of a stretch of cardio like the other two routines.  The instructor is likeable but terrible at cuing.  He randomly calls out the 5678 but not before you start the move like you would expect.  Or he calls nothing at all.I used this as a second, add on to my other workouts and is more of a fun me-time thing than another exercise session to endure for the sake of my waistline.",4,great cardio,1304726400,"05 7, 2011",2011,1740,"['consider', 'intermediate', 'level', 'fitness', 'have', 'minimal', 'dance', 'background', 'maybe', 'year', 'so', 'non-intense', 'lessons', 'have', 'done', 'swing', 'not', 'others', 'more', 'martial', 'arts', 'anything', 'else.The', 'swing', 'jive', 'were', 'fairly', 'easy', 'pick', 'up', 'first', 'time', 'did', 'routines', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'as', 'good', 'workout', 'was', 'still', 'learning', 'second', 'time', 'tried', 'vid', 'had', 'down', 'enough', 'workout', 'actually', 'do', 'get', 'decent', 'cardio', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'time', 'going', 'fun', 'heart', 'rate', 'get', 'there', 'start', 'sweat', 'course', 'approx', '15', 'minute', 'routine', 'Instructors', 'backup', 'dancers', 'music', 'moves', 'were', 'good.The', 'quickstep', 'story', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'difficult', 'dance', 'choreography', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'pick', 'up', 'was', 'still', 'struggling', 'pick', 'up', 'steps', 'second', 'time', 'tried', 'vid', 'had', 'enough', 'down', 'end', 'when', 'do', 'whole', 'routine', '2', '3', 'times', 'row', 'could', 'keep', 'feet', 'moving', 'along', 'even', 'was', 'wrong', 'foot', 'late', 'sometimes', 'did', 'entire', 'routine', 'enough', 'times', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'most', 'intensive', 'workout', '3', 'most', 'first', 'half', 'done', 'very', 'slowly', 'teach', 'moves', 'broken', 'out', 'short', 'segements', 'probably', 'will', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'benefit', 'stretch', 'cardio', 'other', 'two', 'routines', 'instructor', 'likeable', 'terrible', 'cuing', 'randomly', 'out', '5678', 'not', 'start', 'move', 'would', 'expect', 'nothing', 'all.I', 'used', 'second', 'add', 'other', 'workouts', 'more', 'fun', 'me-time', 'thing', 'exercise', 'session', 'endure', 'sake', 'waistline']",Dancing With The Stars: Dance Off The Pounds
1283039,A846NR0T5U8GT,B002PLMJ6K,Gia V.,"[3, 3]","Ok, I got this dvd with two others (DTWS Latin Cardio and Julianne Cardio Ballroom) a few days ago after ordering from Amazon. I'm not very athletic though I do work out every now again, so I have some muscle tone, but really a lot. I'm also NOT a dancer.This dvd has no warm up, so I suggest you do your own.The first dance, the swing, is taught by Kym. She's NOT very good at instructing in this dvd. She starts off with a triple step, which to me is soooo confusing, because what, you jump twice on one foot, once on the other, or is it three times or twice on both?? She doesn't explain, she just jumps right into it. Also, the dance itself was NOT very fun. It wasn't a lively dance and some of the moves were just weird to do.The second dance by Lacey is the Jive. This dance was MUCH better. She explains a few steps very clearly and does them slowly a couple of times so you get the hang of it. It will really make you sweat, I mean like it will KILL your legs.The third dance is the quickstep taught by Dmitry. Excellent instructor, he did everything SLOW so you could really understand it. He would stop, explain, show. Stop, explain, show. This may be a bit hard for those who wish to keep their heart rate going, but it does wonders to get the moves right. Here's the catch: Once he starts, he DOES NOT STOP. This quickstep at the beginning seems like it's the easiest but once he gets going, it becomes the hardest of the two. The good thing is that once you get the steps you can keep doing them while he stops, so you keep your heart rate up.

1283044,A3IKFQC64SS4WO,B002PLMJ6K,mcel,"[34, 34]","This DVD is a VAST improvement over the previous DWTS DVDs. First off there are less sections, but the segements are longer, which I like more since I think choppy short segments don't give you an adequate workout.Lots of cardio in this DVD, and while it is a whole lot of fun, it is very challenging. I was soaked after doing the workout. To give you an idea of my background, I am an intermediate level in fitness DVDs and I have been dancing since the age of 4.I decided to do this DVD from start to finish so I could see the quality of the workouts and time it as well.The first section is Swing with Kym. This is great, alot of what you may have seen in the Jive sections if you got the first DWTS DVD, but it is still a very good workout. Kym not only does swing, she also adds in some Charleston, which was a nice change since I've never done that. You may be a little lost if you don't have any background in dance, but Kym does do her best to explain moves like pas de bouree  the best she can in the few seconds she has before jumping in. Definitely gets your heart rate up with kicks. This was just the first section and I was tired after it--and I still had two more sections to go!Next up was Lacey with Jive. Whoooo!! This moves fast and is similar to the swing section, but the moves are smaller and more precise, so it is more difficult since you have to keep your moves compact. This one was a real burner AND the steps while a lot of fun, again are hard to get down on the first try if you don't have a dance background. And it goes REALLY fast. I even had a hard time keeping up and just had to triple on the spot a few times. She also throws in some little X jumps and squats which were unexpected but complemented the moves quite well and were REALLY intense layered with all the moves in the routine. I thought this was the hardest section until I got to.....Quitckstep with Dmitry. This dance I am totally unfamiliar with, as is most people, so it starts off a little slower in the breakdown of moves. But don't let this fool you, this section must be a HUGE calorie burner because there are a lot of jumps and hops, and the pace speeds up as you go along. Dmitry was great and is absolutely adorable! He is a good teacher for the amount of time you get, and does his best to break down these moves that go so fast and look so easy, but take so much effort. He also throws some jump squats in at the end of the routine, which I enjoyed and felt the next day!Then there is a short cooldown with all 3 instructors, about 8-10 minutes if that. The cooldown is adequate and by that time I was so tired, I just didn't care and any stretches felt good.This is an excellent video and is sure to burn major calories and fat. Here I am the next day and my butt and legs are sore--almost like when I go for a run! It is that good. And it has to be great cardio. I am so glad since I hate doing cardio, this is fun and something I will actually look forward to doing!A couple of cautions: 1) There is no warm up here (which is odd since it is such an intense workout) so if you need a warmup do some light strecthing or aerobics.2)These are fast dances, so you will lose time frequently in your first few workouts. I know I did. So that kind of messes up the routine as you go along. But please don't get discouraged. Just triple step or march in time until the routine starts and try again.All in all,excellent cardio DVD if you are looking for something different and love to dance. I also purchased the DWTS Dance Body Tone and will try it later this week! I will post a review of that as well, but I think ""Dance Off the Pounds"" is top-notch!",5,Fun and challenging!,1260748800,"12 14, 2009",2009,3658,"['DVD', 'VAST', 'improvement', 'previous', 'DWTS', 'DVDs', 'First', 'are', 'less', 'sections', 'segements', 'are', 'longer', 'more', 'think', 'choppy', 'short', 'segments', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'adequate', 'workout.Lots', 'cardio', 'DVD', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'very', 'challenging', 'was', 'soaked', 'doing', 'workout', 'give', 'idea', 'background', 'am', 'intermediate', 'level', 'fitness', 'DVDs', 'have', 'been', 'dancing', 'age', '4.I', 'decided', 'do', 'DVD', 'start', 'finish', 'so', 'could', 'see', 'quality', 'workouts', 'time', 'well.The', 'first', 'section', 'Swing', 'Kym', 'great', 'alot', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'Jive', 'sections', 'got', 'first', 'DWTS', 'DVD', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'workout', 'Kym', 'not', 'only', 'swing', 'also', 'Charleston', 'was', 'nice', 'change', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'lost', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'background', 'dance', 'Kym', 'do', 'best', 'explain', 'moves', 'pas', 'bouree', 'best', 'can', 'few', 'seconds', 'before', 'jumping', 'Definitely', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'kicks', 'was', 'just', 'first', 'section', 'was', 'tired', 'still', 'had', 'two', 'more', 'sections', 'go', 'Next', 'up', 'was', 'Lacey', 'Jive', 'Whoooo', 'fast', 'similar', 'swing', 'section', 'moves', 'are', 'smaller', 'more', 'precise', 'more', 'difficult', 'have', 'keep', 'moves', 'compact', 'one', 'was', 'real', 'burner', 'steps', 'lot', 'fun', 'again', 'are', 'hard', 'get', 'down', 'first', 'try', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'dance', 'background', 'REALLY', 'fast', 'even', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'keeping', 'up', 'just', 'had', 'triple', 'spot', 'few', 'times', 'also', 'little', 'X', 'jumps', 'squats', 'were', 'unexpected', 'complemented', 'moves', 'quite', 'well', 'were', 'REALLY', 'intense', 'layered', 'moves', 'routine', 'thought', 'was', 'hardest', 'section', 'got', '..Quitckstep', 'Dmitry', 'dance', 'am', 'totally', 'unfamiliar', 'most', 'people', 'little', 'slower', 'breakdown', 'moves', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fool', 'section', 'must', 'be', 'HUGE', 'calorie', 'burner', 'are', 'lot', 'jumps', 'hops', 'pace', 'up', 'go', 'along', 'Dmitry', 'was', 'great', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'good', 'teacher', 'amount', 'time', 'get', 'best', 'break', 'down', 'moves', 'go', 'so', 'fast', 'look', 'so', 'easy', 'take', 'so', 'much', 'effort', 'also', 'jump', 'squats', 'end', 'routine', 'enjoyed', 'felt', 'next', 'day', 'Then', 'short', 'cooldown', '3', 'instructors', '8-10', 'minutes', 'cooldown', 'adequate', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'tired', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'stretches', 'felt', 'good.This', 'excellent', 'video', 'sure', 'burn', 'major', 'calories', 'fat', 'Here', 'am', 'next', 'day', 'butt', 'legs', 'are', 'sore', 'almost', 'when', 'go', 'run', 'good', 'be', 'great', 'cardio', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'hate', 'doing', 'cardio', 'fun', 'something', 'will', 'actually', 'look', 'forward', 'doing', 'couple', 'cautions', '1', 'warm', 'up', 'here', 'odd', 'such', 'intense', 'workout', 'so', 'need', 'warmup', 'do', 'light', 'strecthing', 'aerobics.2', 'are', 'fast', 'dances', 'will', 'lose', 'time', 'frequently', 'first', 'few', 'workouts', 'know', 'did', 'So', 'kind', 'messes', 'routine', 'go', 'along', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'discouraged', 'Just', 'triple', 'step', 'march', 'time', 'routine', 'starts', 'try', 'again.All', 'excellent', 'cardio', 'DVD', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'love', 'dance', 'also', 'purchased', 'DWTS', 'Dance', 'Body', 'Tone', 'will', 'try', 'later', 'week', 'will', 'post', 'review', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'Dance', 'Off', 'Pounds', 'top-notch']",Dancing With The Stars: Dance Off The Pounds

1283049,A1BYGXZTXEX9DF,B002PLMJ6K,"W. Smith ""Steampunk Enthusiast""","[3, 4]","Having recently purchased this DVD I was excited to try it out.  I have a strong power-lifting routine in place but I wanted some cardio to tone my midsection a bit.  I have seen other ""dance fitness"" programs on my cable's On Demand exercise channel and they all walk you through moves slowly and methodically so you can stay with the on-screen action.  With this DVD, I was unimpressed, to say the least, with the lack of instruction.  One of the dancers would spend a couple of seconds showing a move and then it's on to the next routine.  It wouldn't be so bad if the camera work showed off the footwork, but it didn't.  The dance stars use lingo like ""rock step"", ""triple step"" and ""step, ball, change"" that probably means a lot to a trained dancer but not to a non-dancer that decided to try a DVD on whim.  Again, had they illustrated the moves more slowly and visually this would be o.k.- why not show the moves individually on the ""Extras"" portion of the DVD like other ""dancercise"" series are known to do?I tried to persevere through the frustration- but, alas, it just didn't work out.  After about seven viewings I knew I was still faking it, and although sweating a bit, I felt there were other videos out there that would be more efficient.  I've gone back to the On Demand options through my cable for dance cardio and Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred for even more intense cardio(combined with strength/ab training).I am sure the well-known Dancing With the Stars franchise label helps to sell this DVD- I'm probably one of the suckers myself!  That being said, I've moved on to better options and I'll be more careful with my purchases.  Again, if you are serious about losing weight, check out Jillian Michaels stuff.In the end this DVD fails as both dance instruction and exercise- and maybe because it's a middle ground hybrid that never really dedicates itself to either one in full force.",1,Fails as Both Dance Instruction and Exercise,1280448000,"07 30, 2010",2010,1908,"['Having', 'recently', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'was', 'excited', 'try', 'out', 'have', 'strong', 'power-lifting', 'routine', 'place', 'wanted', 'cardio', 'tone', 'midsection', 'bit', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'dance', 'fitness', 'programs', 'cable', 'Demand', 'exercise', 'channel', 'walk', 'moves', 'slowly', 'methodically', 'can', 'stay', 'on-screen', 'action', 'DVD', 'was', 'unimpressed', 'say', 'least', 'lack', 'instruction', 'One', 'dancers', 'would', 'spend', 'couple', 'seconds', 'showing', 'move', 'then', 'next', 'routine', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'camera', 'work', 'showed', 'footwork', 'did', ""n't"", 'dance', 'stars', 'use', 'rock', 'step', 'triple', 'step', 'step', 'ball', 'change', 'probably', 'lot', 'trained', 'dancer', 'not', 'non-dancer', 'decided', 'try', 'DVD', 'whim', 'Again', 'had', 'illustrated', 'moves', 'more', 'slowly', 'visually', 'would', 'be', 'o.k.-', 'why', 'not', 'show', 'moves', 'individually', 'Extras', 'portion', 'DVD', 'other', 'dancercise', 'series', 'are', 'known', 'do', 'tried', 'persevere', 'frustration-', 'alas', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'seven', 'viewings', 'knew', 'was', 'still', 'faking', 'sweating', 'bit', 'felt', 'were', 'other', 'videos', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'efficient', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'back', 'Demand', 'options', 'cable', 'dance', 'cardio', 'Jillian', 'Michael', '30', 'Day', 'Shred', 'even', 'more', 'intense', 'cardio', 'combined', 'strength/ab', 'training', 'am', 'sure', 'well-known', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'franchise', 'label', 'sell', 'DVD-', ""'m"", 'probably', 'one', 'suckers', 'being', 'said', ""'ve"", 'moved', 'better', 'options', ""'ll"", 'be', 'more', 'careful', 'purchases', 'Again', 'are', 'serious', 'losing', 'weight', 'check', 'out', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'end', 'DVD', 'dance', 'instruction', 'exercise-', 'maybe', 'middle', 'ground', 'hybrid', 'never', 'really', 'one', 'full', 'force']",Dancing With The Stars: Dance Off The Pounds
