But when that plot is someones reality and their life is being lived out on screen those twists and turns can be really sad and devastating to watch. The movie Once just wracked my heart with its passion so finding out that the pair had fallen in love just heightened the incredible experience of it all. And then, to see that their music went beyond the movie was icing on the cake. When I first saw this documentary on Amazon I was so excited to hear the real story of their lives, the behind the scenes reality of their everyday. The end result was really tragic to me but strangely beautiful all the same. I think the tortured spirit that Glen Hansaard carries with him is what makes his music so powerful, and the addition of Marketa's sweet as honey, melodic voice made for a truly magical pairing. And we'll always have that.",5,Loved this for what it was...,1342742400,"07 20, 2012",2012,919,"['Sometimes', 'movie', 'just', 'good', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'direction', 'plot', 'going', 'when', 'plot', 'someones', 'reality', 'life', 'being', 'lived', 'out', 'screen', 'twists', 'turns', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'sad', 'devastating', 'watch', 'movie', 'Once', 'just', 'wracked', 'heart', 'passion', 'so', 'finding', 'out', 'pair', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'just', 'heightened', 'incredible', 'experience', 'then', 'see', 'music', 'went', 'movie', 'was', 'icing', 'cake', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'documentary', 'Amazon', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'hear', 'real', 'story', 'lives', 'scenes', 'reality', 'everyday', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'really', 'tragic', 'strangely', 'beautiful', 'same', 'think', 'tortured', 'spirit', 'Glen', 'Hansaard', 'what', 'music', 'so', 'powerful', 'addition', 'Marketa', 'sweet', 'honey', 'melodic', 'voice', 'made', 'truly', 'magical', 'pairing', ""'ll"", 'always', 'have']",The Swell Season

1505651,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005YFGIX4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[16, 18]","Like many, I fell in love with the duo of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova with the unexpected hit movie ""Once."" This tiny movie, made for almost no money, catapulted the pair into indie prominence and even won them an Oscar for Best Original Song (one of my favorites--Falling Slowly). To capitalize on their seemingly instant success, the band (named The Swell Season) hit the road for a two year world tour. But what is the price of instant notoriety? Hansard, who had been working for musical success for many years, was ready and willing to make the commitment that fame dictated. Irglova, on the other hand, was a more reticent partner for whom success came out of the blue. The tour and their fundamental differences put a strain on their real-life romance. With a subtle fly-on-the-wall appeal, the documentary ""The Swell Season"" chronicles this tumultuous period through amazing highs and disappointing lows. It is a tribute to their artistry, to their music, and to their friendship even as the stresses of the road threaten to alter their relationship irrevocably.""The Swell Season"" is not a movie that promises over-the-top drama, it has a quiet power that sneaks up on you. Initially, it seems that Hansard and Irglova are perfectly in sync. But through small moments, we see Irglova start to pull away and Hansard start to become more and more affected by her withdrawal. The pair seem like great pals throughout, even as their romance appears to dissipate, and you become quite invested in the progression of their relationship. No one is right, no one is wrong. Each is just affected by the tour and its subsequent responsibilities in a different way. Both are refreshingly candid, and don't seem particularly conscious of the camera filming every second of their interactions. Hansard's family provide some of the movie's most intimate and honest moments as the Oscar win threatens to define the couple in a way neither has anticipated (one fan has Irglova's Oscar acceptance quip tattooed on his arm).As a poignant character piece, ""The Swell Season"" has a lot to recommend it. But foremost, there is a lot of concert footage that is worth the price of admission alone! If you like the band, the music makes this documentary virtually unmissable. Raw and powerful, they have a sound like no other. The DVD boasts deleted scenes and extended concert footage, and I've watched the concert portions several times since viewing the actual film. I really liked this piece overall, it is refreshingly understated. It doesn't draw any conclusions for you and has no grandstanding. The camera is just there, unobstructed, and as much is said by slight expressions and silent moments as by what is actually verbalized. If you like rock documentaries, this is an essential one about a real couple in a very unorthodox situation.

1505652,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B005YFGIX4,M. Oleson,"[1, 2]","The title references the recording and touring group that began as a collaboration between Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova.  They  became Oscar winners and stars for their hit movie from 2007, ""Once.""  They met in Dublin when Irglova was still a teen, having immigrated from The Czech Republic with her mother.  In spite of their 18 year age difference they became music partners that developed into something more.  This documentary focuses on their post-Oscar (2008) fame.Shot in an unromantic black and white like a home movie, the style while raw is very effective.  We see the more experienced Hansard (""The Frames"") find his dream of music stardom, but still looking for something more.  Irglova on the other hand was thrown into the fray as a shy, unassuming 18 year old at the time ""Once"" was shot.  She is clearly uncomfortable with the fame, the fans and the autographs that come with the accolades.  In one scene she is surprised coming off the tour bus early in the morning, only to find a couple teenagers looking for a conversation and some pictures.Eventually we see their real life romance begin to fizzle and each partner can't see the other's point of view and even if they do, don't know what to do about it.  Most of the film is shot at concerts with plenty of back stage story telling.  It is convincing to see the song writing follow their relationship, whether that was the original intent or not.  We see some back story of Glen, with interviews of his proud mother and alcoholic father (who died during the filming of the documentary).  Hansard talks about his schooling as it were.  He dropped out at age 15 to begin his music career.  Unfortunately we don't get much of anything on Irglova at all.  That's a disappointment.  Still, overall this is a brief study on how fame changes a person.  The film suggests that although the couple is no longer romantically connected, the touring would continue.  From what I can tell as I write this, they have opted for solo careers.  Too bad for fans.",4,"An excellent documentary about the rise of the ""Once"" stars",1342656000,"07 19, 2012",2012,2020,"['title', 'recording', 'touring', 'group', 'began', 'collaboration', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'Marketa', 'Irglova', 'became', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'stars', 'hit', 'movie', '2007', 'Once', 'met', 'Dublin', 'when', 'Irglova', 'was', 'still', 'teen', 'having', 'immigrated', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'mother', 'spite', '18', 'year', 'age', 'difference', 'became', 'music', 'partners', 'developed', 'something', 'more', 'documentary', 'focuses', 'post-Oscar', '2008', 'fame.Shot', 'unromantic', 'black', 'white', 'home', 'movie', 'style', 'raw', 'very', 'effective', 'see', 'more', 'experienced', 'Hansard', 'Frames', 'find', 'dream', 'music', 'stardom', 'still', 'looking', 'something', 'more', 'Irglova', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'thrown', 'fray', 'shy', 'unassuming', '18', 'year', 'old', 'time', 'Once', 'was', 'shot', 'clearly', 'uncomfortable', 'fame', 'fans', 'autographs', 'accolades', 'one', 'scene', 'surprised', 'coming', 'off', 'tour', 'bus', 'early', 'morning', 'only', 'find', 'couple', 'teenagers', 'looking', 'conversation', 'pictures.Eventually', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'romance', 'begin', 'fizzle', 'partner', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'point', 'view', 'even', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'Most', 'film', 'shot', 'concerts', 'plenty', 'back', 'stage', 'story', 'telling', 'convincing', 'see', 'song', 'writing', 'follow', 'relationship', 'was', 'original', 'intent', 'not', 'see', 'back', 'story', 'Glen', 'interviews', 'proud', 'mother', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'who', 'died', 'filming', 'documentary', 'Hansard', 'schooling', 'were', 'dropped', 'out', 'age', '15', 'begin', 'music', 'career', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'anything', 'Irglova', 'disappointment', 'Still', 'overall', 'brief', 'study', 'how', 'fame', 'person', 'film', 'couple', 'no', 'longer', 'romantically', 'connected', 'touring', 'would', 'continue', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'write', 'have', 'opted', 'solo', 'careers', 'Too', 'bad', 'fans']",The Swell Season
1505653,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B005YFGIX4,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[9, 12]","My fellow Amazon reviewer - K. Harris - has pretty much covered the plot, and back story, of this film, so I won't repeat much of what he (?) has written. This 2011 90-minute documentary, shot in black and white on what appears to be HD digital (the images are sharp) is part of the almost never ending story of Irish Singer-songwriters Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. The film of their meeting and beginning as performers was captured in the film ""Once"". This current film documents their careers beginning after their success for winning the Oscar for the Best Song (""Falling Slowly"") and follows them to their current status as performers, but no longer lovers. And, now ""Once"" has been brought to the Broadway stage as a musical (with the Original Cast album being released today!).This film has THREE Directors and, while the concert footage - and there is a lot (including 8 musical performances among the 10 deleted scenes - an additional 45 minutes - in the bonus features) - is what you would expect, many of the ""personal"" scenes - especially one lengthy scene in a caf&eacute; at the 1hr, 10 minute point - is VERY personal. It's hard to believe that the couple knows the camera is right there capturing their intimacy.There are nearly two-dozen songs performed in the film, though many are excerpts.This is a most unique music documentary in it's structure and - again, I need to use the word ""intimate"" portrait of what happens when a guy drops out of high school at 14 to become a street ""busker"" and, 18 years later, meets a girl of 18 who has just graduated from high school and together they become an ""overnight"" success in the music business with all that fame entails.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,"The sharp black and white photography matches the mood of this story of the ""price of success""",1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,1781,"['fellow', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'K.', 'Harris', 'pretty', 'much', 'covered', 'plot', 'back', 'story', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'much', 'what', 'written', '2011', '90-minute', 'documentary', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'what', 'be', 'HD', 'digital', 'images', 'are', 'sharp', 'part', 'almost', 'never', 'ending', 'story', 'Irish', 'Singer-songwriters', 'Glen', 'Hansard', 'Marketa', 'Irglova', 'film', 'meeting', 'beginning', 'performers', 'was', 'captured', 'film', 'Once', 'current', 'film', 'documents', 'careers', 'beginning', 'success', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Song', 'Falling', 'Slowly', 'current', 'status', 'performers', 'no', 'longer', 'lovers', 'now', 'Once', 'been', 'brought', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'musical', 'Original', 'Cast', 'album', 'being', 'released', 'today', '.This', 'film', 'THREE', 'Directors', 'concert', 'footage', 'lot', 'including', '8', 'musical', 'performances', '10', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'additional', '45', 'minutes', 'bonus', 'features', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'many', 'personal', 'scenes', 'especially', 'one', 'lengthy', 'scene', 'caf', 'eacute', '1hr', '10', 'minute', 'point', 'VERY', 'personal', 'hard', 'believe', 'couple', 'camera', 'right', 'there', 'capturing', 'intimacy.There', 'are', 'nearly', 'two-dozen', 'songs', 'performed', 'film', 'many', 'are', 'excerpts.This', 'most', 'unique', 'music', 'documentary', 'structure', 'again', 'need', 'use', 'word', 'intimate', 'portrait', 'what', 'when', 'guy', 'high', 'school', '14', 'become', 'street', 'busker', '18', 'years', 'later', 'girl', '18', 'who', 'just', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'together', 'become', 'overnight', 'success', 'music', 'business', 'fame', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",The Swell Season
