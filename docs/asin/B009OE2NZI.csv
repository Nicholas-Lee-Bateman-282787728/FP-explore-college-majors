I noticed they are featured in production order but considering most of ZIV-TV's programs were syndicated, there are no official broadcast dates for episodes, just episode numbers. The picture quality is superb and having already watched every episode as it aired on the Westerns Channel a few years ago, these are truly uncut and unedited by comparison. Grab both seasons and hopefully the third and final season will be released on DVD this year!",5,A Bargain of a Price,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,562,"['kind', 'box', 'set', 'would', 'expect', 'pay', '34.95', 'retail', 'instead', 'pay', 'price', 'What', 'bargain', 'noticed', 'are', 'featured', 'production', 'order', 'considering', 'most', 'ZIV-TV', 'programs', 'were', 'syndicated', 'are', 'official', 'broadcast', 'dates', 'episodes', 'just', 'episode', 'numbers', 'picture', 'quality', 'superb', 'having', 'already', 'watched', 'episode', 'aired', 'Westerns', 'Channel', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'truly', 'uncut', 'unedited', 'comparison', 'Grab', 'seasons', 'hopefully', 'third', 'final', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'year']",Bat Masterson Complete Season Two

I also love the Theme to this show Bat Masterson; I have the first { 1st } two { 2 } Seasons of this show, and I'm looking forward to the remaining Season's to come out on to DVD.  In the show, Bat Masterson believes and stands for Law And Order, and he will do what ever he has to, just to keep the Peace in the Area to where he is @ that Particular Time.  I have found that in Many Case's, in a round and about way, he's something like Richard Dean Anderson { MacGyver }; with the exception that in some case's, Bat Masterson has to @ times go using his Gun, but in what I have found to the best of my recollection, Bat Masterson uses his Cane or what ever he can find to help him out of a jam, to the very best of my recollection that is.
