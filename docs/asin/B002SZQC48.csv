1287601,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B002SZQC48,&#308;&#308;,"[0, 0]","I've been working out with the ""10 Minute Solution"" brand of DVDs for years and have never given one a rating less than 4 stars.  However, this DVD didn't challenge me at all and actually had me in pain due to the sculpting loop.  The loop felt like sandpaper rubbing against my leg, despite the fact that it's made from an elastic/plastic type material (much like the bands in other ""10 Minute Solution"" DVDs).  It didn't really want to stay put either, and was an annoyance as other people have already mentioned in reviews.Jessica Smith is usually a fabulous instructor, and she wasn't a disappointment in these workouts.  My complaints lie completely with the workouts and the loop.Other reviewers have done fantastic descriptions of the workouts included on the DVD, so I'll just give my opinion instead of going too in depth.BETTER BOOTY CAMP was completely uneffective for me.  I think squatting for 10 minutes would be a better workout.STONG & SLIM THIGHS seemed more focused on the belly and butt; I didn't feel it in my thighs much at all.  The loop was particularly painful in this sectionTRIM & TONED TUMMY proves that Jessica is the queen of floor ab workouts.  I've never done an ab workout with her that hasn't been amazing.  I felt the burn of this section and finally felt like I was actually working out.  This routine seemed to pull a lot from pilates moves.LOWER BODY MAKEOVER is more of a cardio workout.  The loop kept slipping down to my ankles where I didn't find it to have much resistance.  I may try to use this workout as simply cardio without the band.BELLY FLAB FIGHTER is also a cardio workout.  It's kind of like a higher impact standing abs workout.  I didn't find it to be very good for toning abs, but it was definitely cardio.Overall Jessica is a wonderful instructor, the cardio workouts are definite cardio, and the ab workout is great.  Unfortunately, the toning loop was painful on my legs and kept slipping down, the first two toning workouts were uneffective for me, and I didn't find that the cardio routines were that good for toning.  This is the first time I am ever recommending not to get a ""10 Minute Solution"" workout.  EvenCrunch: Belly Butt and Thighs Bootcampis better, and it's not incredibly intense either.  I highly recommend that you check out other 10 Minute Solution workouts, but give this one a pass.",3,Burns...but not in a good way,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,2362,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'working', 'out', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'brand', 'DVDs', 'years', 'have', 'never', 'given', 'one', 'rating', 'less', '4', 'stars', 'However', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'challenge', 'actually', 'had', 'pain', 'due', 'sculpting', 'loop', 'loop', 'felt', 'sandpaper', 'rubbing', 'leg', 'fact', 'made', 'elastic/plastic', 'type', 'material', 'much', 'bands', 'other', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'DVDs', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'stay', 'was', 'annoyance', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'mentioned', 'reviews.Jessica', 'Smith', 'usually', 'fabulous', 'instructor', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointment', 'workouts', 'complaints', 'lie', 'completely', 'workouts', 'loop.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'fantastic', 'descriptions', 'workouts', 'included', 'DVD', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'give', 'opinion', 'instead', 'going', 'too', 'depth.BETTER', 'BOOTY', 'CAMP', 'was', 'completely', 'uneffective', 'think', 'squatting', '10', 'minutes', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'workout.STONG', 'SLIM', 'THIGHS', 'seemed', 'more', 'focused', 'belly', 'butt', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'thighs', 'much', 'loop', 'was', 'particularly', 'painful', 'sectionTRIM', 'TONED', 'TUMMY', 'Jessica', 'queen', 'floor', 'ab', 'workouts', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'ab', 'workout', ""n't"", 'been', 'amazing', 'felt', 'burn', 'section', 'finally', 'felt', 'was', 'actually', 'working', 'out', 'routine', 'seemed', 'pull', 'lot', 'pilates', 'moves.LOWER', 'BODY', 'MAKEOVER', 'more', 'cardio', 'workout', 'loop', 'kept', 'slipping', 'down', 'ankles', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'have', 'much', 'resistance', 'may', 'try', 'use', 'workout', 'simply', 'cardio', 'band.BELLY', 'FLAB', 'FIGHTER', 'also', 'cardio', 'workout', 'kind', 'higher', 'impact', 'standing', 'abs', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'toning', 'abs', 'was', 'definitely', 'cardio.Overall', 'Jessica', 'wonderful', 'instructor', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'are', 'definite', 'cardio', 'ab', 'workout', 'great', 'Unfortunately', 'toning', 'loop', 'was', 'painful', 'legs', 'kept', 'slipping', 'down', 'first', 'two', 'toning', 'workouts', 'were', 'uneffective', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'cardio', 'routines', 'were', 'good', 'toning', 'first', 'time', 'am', 'ever', 'recommending', 'not', 'get', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'workout', 'EvenCrunch', 'Belly', 'Butt', 'Thighs', 'Bootcampis', 'better', 'not', 'incredibly', 'intense', 'highly', 'recommend', 'check', 'other', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'workouts', 'give', 'one', 'pass']",N/A

Of all the TV-workouts I've done, Jessica Smith is BY FAR my favorite instructor--not only is she the friendliest and most motivating/genuinely likable, she creates the most effective workouts as well. This DVD in particular is one I can always count on and come back to if I really feel like I need a quick tune-up or toner. The loop might be hard to get used to for some (and is occasionally frustrating), but if you write off this workout because of that one minor flaw, you will REALLY be missing out on some great total-body strengthening! I love the fact that Smith always makes sure to include abwork, even when you're focusing on another area of the body; the lower body workouts are also real winners here.

1287605,A2QQR7FWJGKNBC,B002SZQC48,bubbles246,"[24, 25]","First, a background on what workouts I've been doing.  I'm on week five of my goal to lose 20 pounds.  I have been using Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred, and the 10 Minute Solutions Blast Off Belly Fat (and I LOVE both).  I bought this by accident, actually, thinking when I saw it in the store it was the 10 Minute Tone Trouble Zones video.  But, when I got home and realized which one I'd purchased, I decided to try it anyways.  As with the other 10 Minute Solutions videos, this is split into five 10-minute workouts, and you can customize the order you want to do them in.  I've only done it a few times, but here are my thoughts:1-Better Booty Camp:  This looks like a great workout, but you need A LOT of room to do the moves.  I have been working out in my bedroom (where I have the most room to move) and I really can't do this one, which is a bit disappointing.  I thought the moves were hard to learn, but maybe that's because I was so worried about the lack of space to fully do them.  Perhaps if I can figure out a way to make more room to move, I'll try again, but until then, I'm avoiding this one.2-Strong & Slim Thighs:  I thought the hard parts about this one were learning the moves (she goes fast!) and finding and keeping my balance on many of the moves.  I wasn't sure I was doing the moves correctly the first few times I did them.  But, this is a great thigh workout.  I could feel my thighs burning as I did the moves, so I know just 10 minutes a day with this workout will produce results.  I found it difficult to keep the loop in place while doing a few of these moves (it kept slipping or rolling up on itself, which is annoying, so I felt I wasn't getting the resistance I should have been).  But, I didn't have the problems with it that I had in the Lower Body Makeover section.3-Trim & Toned Tummy:  This is my favorite section on the entire DVD.  I have really enjoyed doing the Blast off Belly Fat DVD, so I was looking forward to some more ab work from the 10 Minute Solutions people.  These ab moves are HARD.  Most all of these are moves I haven't seen (not just crunches).  They are very easy to pick up, so a beginner shouldn't be frustrated by trying to learn the moves.  They really, really work your abs.  I seriously love this ab workout.4-Lower Body Makeover:  This section is a higher-energy workout than Strong & Slim Thighs.  I thought learning the moves was a bit harder.  I don't know if she just goes so fast, or if I just can't get it, or what, but it's a bit frustrating, even after trying a few times.  I can see how someone who gets frustrated easily wouldn't like this video and would give up if they weren't catching on quickly enough.  Also, the loop becomes REALLY bothersome in this section (as far as not staying in place) because you're jumping around a lot more.  I think a previous reviewer mentioned putting talcum powder on the loop to keep it from slipping, but I don't have any and haven't had a chance to get to the store for this.  Hopefully it works, because I'd really like to do this section without having to constantly stop and fix the loop.5-Belly Flab Fighter:  This is my second-favorite section of the DVD.  It's a higher-energy ab workout.  I love how you don't have to put the loop on your legs, so you don't have to deal w/ the loop slipping.  You do put it on your arms for some oblique work.  The only place where I got frustrated with the loop in this workout was the section where you hold the loop behind your back.  She goes quickly, and doesn't give you enough time to grab the loop, and because you're using both hands, you can't pause the video.  So, you miss a few reps.  But, overall, this is an awesome ab workout.Overall, I give the video four stars.  I'm going to try to get some powder for the loop, because I really want to master the Lower Body Makeover section.  I recommend watching each section before actually trying it, and even then, you might have to try it a few times before getting the moves down and really feeling like you're getting a workout.  Don't get frustrated!  Keep trying.  And good luck!  :o)",4,"Great Workout, but...",1255219200,"10 11, 2009",2009,4111,"['First', 'background', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', ""'m"", 'week', 'five', 'goal', 'lose', '20', 'pounds', 'have', 'been', 'using', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', '30', 'Day', 'Shred', '10', 'Minute', 'Solutions', 'Blast', 'Off', 'Belly', 'Fat', 'LOVE', 'bought', 'accident', 'actually', 'thinking', 'when', 'saw', 'store', 'was', '10', 'Minute', 'Tone', 'Trouble', 'Zones', 'video', 'when', 'got', 'home', 'realized', 'one', ""'d"", 'purchased', 'decided', 'try', 'anyways', 'other', '10', 'Minute', 'Solutions', 'videos', 'split', 'five', '10-minute', 'workouts', 'can', 'customize', 'order', 'want', 'do', ""'ve"", 'only', 'done', 'few', 'times', 'here', 'are', 'thoughts:1-Better', 'Booty', 'Camp', 'great', 'workout', 'need', 'LOT', 'room', 'do', 'moves', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'out', 'bedroom', 'where', 'have', 'most', 'room', 'move', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'one', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'thought', 'moves', 'were', 'hard', 'learn', 'maybe', 'was', 'so', 'worried', 'lack', 'space', 'fully', 'do', 'Perhaps', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'make', 'more', 'room', 'move', ""'ll"", 'try', 'again', 'then', ""'m"", 'avoiding', 'one.2-Strong', 'Slim', 'Thighs', 'thought', 'hard', 'parts', 'one', 'were', 'learning', 'moves', 'fast', 'finding', 'keeping', 'balance', 'many', 'moves', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'doing', 'moves', 'correctly', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'did', 'great', 'thigh', 'workout', 'could', 'feel', 'thighs', 'burning', 'did', 'moves', 'know', 'just', '10', 'minutes', 'day', 'workout', 'will', 'produce', 'results', 'found', 'difficult', 'keep', 'loop', 'place', 'doing', 'few', 'moves', 'kept', 'slipping', 'rolling', 'up', 'annoying', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'getting', 'resistance', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', 'had', 'Lower', 'Body', 'Makeover', 'section.3-Trim', 'Toned', 'Tummy', 'favorite', 'section', 'entire', 'DVD', 'have', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'doing', 'Blast', 'off', 'Belly', 'Fat', 'DVD', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'more', 'ab', 'work', '10', 'Minute', 'Solutions', 'people', 'ab', 'moves', 'are', 'HARD', 'Most', 'are', 'moves', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'not', 'just', 'crunches', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'pick', 'up', 'beginner', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'frustrated', 'trying', 'learn', 'moves', 'really', 'really', 'work', 'abs', 'seriously', 'love', 'ab', 'workout.4-Lower', 'Body', 'Makeover', 'section', 'higher-energy', 'workout', 'Strong', 'Slim', 'Thighs', 'thought', 'learning', 'moves', 'was', 'bit', 'harder', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'so', 'fast', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'bit', 'frustrating', 'even', 'trying', 'few', 'times', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'someone', 'who', 'frustrated', 'easily', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'video', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'were', ""n't"", 'catching', 'quickly', 'enough', 'Also', 'loop', 'REALLY', 'bothersome', 'section', 'as', 'far', 'not', 'staying', 'place', ""'re"", 'jumping', 'around', 'lot', 'more', 'think', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'putting', 'talcum', 'powder', 'loop', 'keep', 'slipping', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'chance', 'get', 'store', 'Hopefully', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'do', 'section', 'having', 'constantly', 'stop', 'fix', 'loop.5-Belly', 'Flab', 'Fighter', 'second-favorite', 'section', 'DVD', 'higher-energy', 'ab', 'workout', 'love', 'how', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'put', 'loop', 'legs', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'deal', 'w/', 'loop', 'slipping', 'do', 'put', 'arms', 'oblique', 'work', 'only', 'place', 'where', 'got', 'frustrated', 'loop', 'workout', 'was', 'section', 'where', 'hold', 'loop', 'back', 'quickly', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'time', 'grab', 'loop', ""'re"", 'using', 'hands', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pause', 'video', 'So', 'miss', 'few', 'reps', 'overall', 'awesome', 'ab', 'workout.Overall', 'give', 'video', 'four', 'stars', ""'m"", 'going', 'try', 'get', 'powder', 'loop', 'really', 'want', 'master', 'Lower', 'Body', 'Makeover', 'section', 'recommend', 'watching', 'section', 'actually', 'trying', 'even', 'then', 'might', 'have', 'try', 'few', 'times', 'getting', 'moves', 'down', 'really', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'getting', 'workout', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'frustrated', 'Keep', 'trying', 'good', 'luck', 'o']",N/A

1287613,A3DXNZMKVXKUHK,B002SZQC48,"Mrs. W ""Happy Homemaker""","[15, 17]","As with the other 10 Minute Solution DVDS, each section targets a different area of the body.  The one thing I noticed that is a little different from a lot of the other 10 minute solution workouts is that they do not have a section that focuses on the upper body (arms, shoulders) but instead they divide the lower body into two separate workouts, the Better Booty Camp and Strong Slim Thighs.  Better Booty Camp targets the glutes with a variety of moves using the loop that really works your rear end.  Strong and Slim Thighs is an effective selection of exercises to really tone the thighs.  I found that this section really helped me tighten and work my inner thighs (a personal problem area for me) which I love.  Trim and Toned Tummy was a nice variety of ab moves that targets all areas of the abs.  The loop was used in ways that I didn't expect, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  Lower Body Makeover further works the lower body while adding a bit of cardio.  The moves are very fun and unique.  Belly Flab fighter is also a second shot to work the abs (as lower body makeover does for the butt and legs) with cardio and sculpting moves.  The moves in these 5 10-minute sections were not the same as other workouts, which makes it fun to do.  The instructor, which has been used in a couple other 10 Minute Solution workouts, is cheery and motivating.  Her cuing and instruction is very good and she is easy to follow.  I was surprised by the loop in many ways.  I have never used one in a workout before this one so it was a new experience, but I love the added resistance that it adds making the moves more effective.

This just frustrated me to no end because the loop would not stay put, any adjustments I tried sacrificed form.  The ab sections were pretty good, but not enough to validate purchasing the dvd.  My legs are pretty thin, which I think was the main problem with the band slipping.I would recommend this for beginner exercisers because the resistance of the band is fairly lax.  There are some excellent exercises to really target the toosh, however, if you are an avid exerciser - no challenge here :(",3,The loop was a flop for me,1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,629,"['am', 'disappointed', 'loop', 'enjoy', 'Jessica', 'trainer', 'love', '10', 'min', 'solution', 'kickbox', 'dvd', 'weighted', 'gloves', 'just', 'frustrated', 'end', 'loop', 'would', 'not', 'stay', 'put', 'adjustments', 'tried', 'sacrificed', 'form', 'ab', 'sections', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'enough', 'validate', 'purchasing', 'dvd', 'legs', 'are', 'pretty', 'thin', 'think', 'was', 'main', 'problem', 'band', 'slipping.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'beginner', 'exercisers', 'resistance', 'band', 'fairly', 'lax', 'are', 'excellent', 'exercises', 'really', 'target', 'toosh', 'however', 'are', 'avid', 'exerciser', 'challenge', 'here']",N/A

But I have to say that if you're like me, a full grown woman with big legs, big feet and big shoes, you just may have trouble getting that tiny rubber loop around all the above. I mean, we're all not a size 4. Moreover, you may have trouble following her instructions. She's young and small, like most of us are at some brief time in our histories. So, for her and others like her, the movements won't be too hard to catch on to. But the rest of us may have to modify. At least, I do.Having said all that and putting that less than attractive picture before you, I enjoy this workout. I can get it in between the time I wake up, slug around with my coffee and other early morning routine and time for something to eat. I try and get in a Leslie walk at that time. But there are times I only have about ten minutes but really want to do something good for myself during that time. That's when I really appreciate these Ten Minute Solutions --- and this one is a good one. I really like the one for thighs and to a lesser extent the buns. Ten minutes is really all you need to work on problem areas and I love these videos and most of the instructors.Recommended.- Susanna K.
