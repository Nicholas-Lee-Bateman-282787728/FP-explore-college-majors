But here comes the government and it gets a bit heavy.  Add to that some strange scenes - everyone naked in the hot tub, Boomer seemingly coming on to the girl - and it's not nearly as good as parts 1 and 2.  No wonder there was never a part 4!",3,Third Time is Not a Charm Here,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,370,"['third', 'series', 'waaaaaaaaay', 'off', 'track', 'Yean', 'storyline', 'still', 'working', 'nature', 'here', 'government', 'bit', 'heavy', 'Add', 'strange', 'scenes', 'everyone', 'naked', 'hot', 'tub', 'Boomer', 'seemingly', 'coming', 'girl', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'parts', '1', '2', 'wonder', 'was', 'never', 'part', '4']",Adventures of the Wilderness Family 3 VHS

The filming was updated, which is nice, but there was a lot of oddly placed music throughout it that didn't seem to fit well. Not as many animal encounters as natural disasters. Also, as a minor thing, it bothers me when story lines don't match up all the way through a series lol. Not a big deal at all but in this one, the family &#34;inherited&#34; their cabin and land from Skip's uncle and have to prove that it was properly claimed. In the first one, the family &#34;sells all that they have to buy some land and live off it&#34;, they don't even know who the previous cabin owner was in the first one. Boomer tells them about him. A minor criticism really haha. It is a fine movie to watch if you like the Wilderness Family Adventures but my kids LOVED the first one because it moves fairly quickly and has a lot of action in it. Lots of animal encounters. The second one has a little less of that but they still enjoyed it, just not quite as much. The third one they still claim to like but every time they watch it they get bored about half way through it and walk away lol. My own feelings are the same. So, not as good as the first, but still fun if you want to see the wrap up.",3,It's ok,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,1258,"['long', 'time', 'Wilderness', 'Family', 'fan', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'third', 'film', 'filming', 'was', 'updated', 'nice', 'there', 'was', 'lot', 'oddly', 'placed', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'well', 'Not', 'many', 'animal', 'encounters', 'natural', 'disasters', 'Also', 'minor', 'thing', 'when', 'story', 'lines', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'way', 'series', 'lol', 'Not', 'big', 'deal', 'one', 'family', '34', 'inherited', '34', 'cabin', 'land', 'Skip', 'uncle', 'have', 'prove', 'was', 'properly', 'claimed', 'first', 'one', 'family', '34', 'have', 'buy', 'land', 'live', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'who', 'previous', 'cabin', 'owner', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'Boomer', 'minor', 'criticism', 'really', 'haha', 'fine', 'movie', 'watch', 'like', 'Wilderness', 'Family', 'Adventures', 'kids', 'LOVED', 'first', 'one', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'lot', 'action', 'Lots', 'animal', 'encounters', 'second', 'one', 'little', 'less', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'third', 'one', 'still', 'claim', 'like', 'time', 'watch', 'get', 'bored', 'way', 'walk', 'away', 'lol', 'own', 'feelings', 'are', 'same', 'So', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'still', 'fun', 'want', 'see', 'wrap', 'up']",Adventures of the Wilderness Family 3 VHS
