I'll admit the time she spends explaining things can get annoying once you've memorized it, but I just forward through the breathing exercises and crap like that to get to the poses I want. Overall this is a great video and worth it at $5-$7 especially if you're looking to tone your body and become more flexible. I will agree with the other reviewers in that after a while her voice does start to creep you out, but at the same time she's so calm and happy that it's really soothing...I completely disagree that this is a total waste, it's a good workout, give it a try.",4,Really relaxing but thorough workout,1307491200,"06 8, 2011",2011,631,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'video', '5+', 'years', 'now', 'still', 'love', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'time', 'explaining', 'things', 'can', 'get', 'annoying', 'once', ""'ve"", 'memorized', 'just', 'forward', 'breathing', 'exercises', 'crap', 'get', 'poses', 'want', 'Overall', 'great', 'video', 'worth', '5-', '7', 'especially', ""'re"", 'looking', 'tone', 'body', 'become', 'more', 'flexible', 'will', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'voice', 'start', 'creep', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'so', 'calm', 'happy', 'really', 'soothing', 'completely', 'disagree', 'total', 'waste', 'good', 'workout', 'give', 'try']",N/A
807815,A17TDSX354MP7Y,B0001IXU6C,CPTScott,"[57, 59]","I just did all four segments of this a little while ago and I enjoyed it.I am more of an intermediate Pilates person and more advanced in my Yoga (nine years of daily practice) and I have a pretty large library of yoga programs (about 100) and about 18 Pilates programs.This program can be good for someone who is out of shape who need a good place to start, or it can also be good for someone like myself who just wants an easy practice that is still sound and enjoyable. I found this program was good for me this morning because I was pretty tired and slightly under the weather, so for me it was a nice easy practice overall. There are very few challenging moments.I wouldn't consider this a ""workout"" per se but I did like it for what it was. If you want to break a sweat and feel your muscles getting fatigued, then you probably won't find much benefit in this unless you haven't exercised in a long time.The Ab sections is very basic but has some interesting and subtle movements in it which can certainly benefit one's body awareness. The other sections for upper body and lower were also an interesting approach to those areas. The side lying pushup in the upper body section was neat, especially if you do it with one arm at a time. The lower body section had a nice side lying series which I have to admit I definitely felt in my hips and glutes. There is one challenging shoulder bridge in the third section which can be done in a more modified manner.The final total body section is mostly Yoga, The ""Saw"" was really the only Pilates exercise that I can think of, so if you only did that section there wouldn't be much Pilates work going on.I will probably use this program in the future primarily as a gentle practice for low energy days and just do the four sections in a row as I did today. If I had severely low energy I'd probably just do the first three sections or perhaps two of the first three and add the total body segment in as well.I did find Louise Solomon to be a very pleasant instructor to work with. She has a very soothing voice which is always a plus (she has a very ""airy"" voice with an austrailian accent which I loved) and her instructions were easy to follow overall. She's also very unintimidating in terms of her appearance. While she is certainly attractive and healthy looking, she  doesn't look like an over the top super model nor a Ms. Olympia competitor either.I guess in a nutshell I'd say that this DVD can probably be really great for someone looking to get a taste of Pilates and Yoga or for an alternative gentle practice for someone with more experience.",4,Nice Gentle Mix of Pilates and Yoga,1143158400,"03 24, 2006",2006,2604,"['just', 'did', 'four', 'segments', 'little', 'while', 'enjoyed', 'it.I', 'am', 'more', 'intermediate', 'Pilates', 'person', 'more', 'advanced', 'Yoga', 'nine', 'years', 'daily', 'practice', 'have', 'pretty', 'large', 'library', 'yoga', 'programs', '100', '18', 'Pilates', 'programs.This', 'program', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'someone', 'who', 'shape', 'who', 'need', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'good', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'easy', 'practice', 'still', 'sound', 'enjoyable', 'found', 'program', 'was', 'good', 'morning', 'was', 'pretty', 'tired', 'slightly', 'weather', 'so', 'was', 'nice', 'easy', 'practice', 'overall', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'challenging', 'moments.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'workout', 'se', 'did', 'like', 'what', 'was', 'want', 'break', 'sweat', 'feel', 'muscles', 'getting', 'fatigued', 'then', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'benefit', 'have', ""n't"", 'exercised', 'long', 'time.The', 'Ab', 'sections', 'very', 'basic', 'interesting', 'subtle', 'movements', 'can', 'certainly', 'benefit', 'one', 'body', 'awareness', 'other', 'sections', 'upper', 'body', 'lower', 'were', 'also', 'interesting', 'approach', 'areas', 'side', 'lying', 'pushup', 'upper', 'body', 'section', 'was', 'neat', 'especially', 'do', 'one', 'arm', 'time', 'lower', 'body', 'section', 'had', 'nice', 'side', 'lying', 'series', 'have', 'admit', 'definitely', 'felt', 'hips', 'glutes', 'one', 'challenging', 'shoulder', 'bridge', 'third', 'section', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'more', 'modified', 'manner.The', 'final', 'total', 'body', 'section', 'mostly', 'Yoga', 'Saw', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'Pilates', 'exercise', 'can', 'think', 'only', 'did', 'section', 'there', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'Pilates', 'work', 'going', 'on.I', 'will', 'probably', 'use', 'program', 'future', 'primarily', 'gentle', 'practice', 'low', 'energy', 'days', 'just', 'do', 'four', 'sections', 'row', 'did', 'today', 'had', 'severely', 'low', 'energy', ""'d"", 'probably', 'just', 'do', 'first', 'three', 'sections', 'perhaps', 'two', 'first', 'three', 'add', 'total', 'body', 'segment', 'well.I', 'did', 'find', 'Louise', 'Solomon', 'be', 'very', 'pleasant', 'instructor', 'work', 'very', 'soothing', 'voice', 'always', 'plus', 'very', 'airy', 'voice', 'austrailian', 'accent', 'loved', 'instructions', 'were', 'easy', 'follow', 'overall', 'also', 'very', 'unintimidating', 'terms', 'appearance', 'certainly', 'attractive', 'healthy', 'looking', ""n't"", 'look', 'top', 'super', 'model', 'Ms.', 'Olympia', 'competitor', 'either.I', 'guess', 'nutshell', ""'d"", 'say', 'DVD', 'can', 'probably', 'be', 'really', 'great', 'someone', 'looking', 'get', 'taste', 'Pilates', 'Yoga', 'alternative', 'gentle', 'practice', 'someone', 'more', 'experience']",N/A
