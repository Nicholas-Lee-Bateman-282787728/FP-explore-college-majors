P. King's commentary. And I've NEVER watched a movie with the commentary playing, especially not one this length(SATC was longer then I expected, over 2 hours). The film is so fun. You laugh, cry, then laugh while you're crying.The commentary is amazing. For anyone who loves this series and has seen the all the episodes(over and over and over again!), he is eloquent, funny, tells the best little movie tidbits and was a complete joy to listen to! I was exhausted and literally could not stop watching/listening! He tells interesting things about production, things in the background, actors who appeared in episodes who he just had to have back for the movie.

Sarah Jessica Paker slips back into perfect ease as writer Carrie Bradshaw, the rest of the cast definitely left a good impression on me expect Jennifer Hudson, not a big fan of her work. This film is much more dramatic and that's a good thing, I was hoping the movie verison wouldn't be fluffy or superficial. The writing is still top notch thanks to Michael Patrick King, the look of the film is great as well. I highly recommend this gem of a movie, you won't be disappointed.

Sure the movie had its pitfalls like the ""will Big & Carrie marry or is this the final break-up?"" etc., but for the most part it gives us fans one last hurrah. I guess the movie could be seen as the cherry on top of an already luscious and decadent sundae.Did we need the movie? Probably not, but I'm glad the powers that be decided to make it. And just like that cherry, the movie is just a lovely garnish that topped off a really wonderful television series.Here's what's on the SATCTM DVD Sp. Ed.:DVD #1***Extended Version of the movie--(Run Time 151 mins)--I think the extended scenes show Carrie, Charlotte, Harry and Lily on Halloween (I don't remember that scene in the movie)***Commentary By Director/Writer Michael Patrick KingDVD #2***Digital Copy of the Movie--To play on computer/ipods etc., w/out dvd***Conversation W/Sarah Jessica Parker & MPK--24-minute featurette with director MPK and star SJP discussing various scenes***The Fabulous Fashion Of SATC--18-minute Featurette with Costume Designer Patricia Field(who should win the Academy Award)--takes viewers on a behind-the-scenes of the fab wardrobe, shoes, bags and jewelery used in the movie and includes shots of the cast while filming***Additional Scenes w/director commentary--Four additional scenes not in the movie or extended cut and MPK discusses each one***Additional Scenes w/out commentary--the four above scenes w/out MPK***Fergie In The Studio--Two-minute thing w/Fergie and the recording session for the song ""Labels or Love"" for the soundtrackAll in all a pretty good DVD set for fans of both the show and the movie.

(CSI and The L-Word being others)  I didn't buy Season Six in protest of the way they split it into two DVD sets, thereby doubling the price for the Season, but I digress.  The movie picks up the threads four years after the series left off.Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) has reconciled with Big (Chris Noth) and the two are apartment hunting in Manhattan.Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is still married to Steve (David Eigenberg) but having problems balancing the responsibilities of home, family, work and social life.Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is happily married to Harry (Evan Handler) and the couple have adopted a daughter named Lily.Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is living with Smith (Jason Lewis) in LA, commuting to New York for important social events.So now you're up to date, here we go with the Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1. Carrie and Big make an important decision based on legal rights over property2. Miranda makes an important decision based on Steve's actions3. Charlotte has big news, but is afraid that something may happen to ruin everything4. Samantha is restless, and not getting any younger5. In vogue wedding ends up in Vogue magazine, but the honeymoon isn't exactly what the bride had in mind.6. Carrie hires an assistant, Louise from St. Louis (Jennifer Hudson), an efficient young woman with great taste in brand names and shoes, who still believes in love.7. The tides of life wax and wane and wax again in thoroughly entertaining fashion8. All join in wishing Samantha another 50 years!!This movie captures the spirit of the series, the only thing missing being not enough Stanford Blatch (Willie Garson) and Anthony Marantino (Mario Cantone)The soundtrack is also excellent, with songs by Fergie, Jennifer Hudson, Jem, Nina Simone, India-Arie and others.Highly recommended for all fans of the show, and the fashion forward.Amanda Richards, June 22, 2008",5,Nothing lost in transition,1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,2031,"['one', 'few', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'beginning', 'considered', 'good', 'ground-breaking', 'enough', 'actually', 'buy', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'CSI', 'L-Word', 'being', 'others', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Season', 'Six', 'protest', 'way', 'split', 'two', 'DVD', 'sets', 'thereby', 'doubling', 'price', 'Season', 'digress', 'movie', 'up', 'threads', 'four', 'years', 'series', 'left', 'off.Carrie', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'reconciled', 'Big', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'two', 'are', 'apartment', 'hunting', 'Manhattan.Miranda', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'still', 'married', 'Steve', 'David', 'Eigenberg', 'having', 'problems', 'balancing', 'responsibilities', 'home', 'family', 'work', 'social', 'life.Charlotte', 'Kristin', 'Davis', 'happily', 'married', 'Harry', 'Evan', 'Handler', 'couple', 'have', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'named', 'Lily.Samantha', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'living', 'Smith', 'Jason', 'Lewis', 'LA', 'commuting', 'New', 'York', 'important', 'social', 'events.So', 'now', ""'re"", 'up', 'date', 'here', 'go', 'Short', 'Attention', 'Span', 'Summary', 'SASS', ':1', 'Carrie', 'Big', 'make', 'important', 'decision', 'based', 'legal', 'rights', 'property2', 'Miranda', 'important', 'decision', 'based', 'Steve', 'actions3', 'Charlotte', 'big', 'news', 'afraid', 'something', 'may', 'happen', 'ruin', 'everything4', 'Samantha', 'restless', 'not', 'getting', 'younger5', 'vogue', 'wedding', 'up', 'Vogue', 'magazine', 'honeymoon', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'what', 'bride', 'had', 'mind.6', 'Carrie', 'assistant', 'Louise', 'St.', 'Louis', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'efficient', 'young', 'woman', 'great', 'taste', 'brand', 'names', 'shoes', 'who', 'still', 'love.7', 'tides', 'life', 'wax', 'wane', 'wax', 'again', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'fashion8', 'join', 'wishing', 'Samantha', '50', 'years', 'movie', 'spirit', 'series', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'being', 'not', 'enough', 'Stanford', 'Blatch', 'Willie', 'Garson', 'Anthony', 'Marantino', 'Mario', 'Cantone', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'excellent', 'songs', 'Fergie', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'Jem', 'Nina', 'Simone', 'India-Arie', 'others.Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'show', 'fashion', 'forward.Amanda', 'Richards', 'June', '22', '2008']",N/A

1179843,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001DDBCUA,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Ok, so I'll be honest.  I have only seen one full episode of the show and maybe five or six half episodes.  I never had HBO and so I'd watch it on occasion when on vacation and holed up in a hotel room.  I found it witty and at times engaging (and titillating) but it was never anything I needed to rush out and see.  In fact, I wasn't going to bother with ever watching the movies since, well, I didn't think I'd know what was going on.  The other night this came on and my wife suggested we watch it since it was supposed to be funny.OK.Thankfully, the few sporadic `half episodes' I did happen to see had introduced me to some key characters in the film.  I knew who Steve was because I saw a part of the episode where Miranda finds out he has an eating disorder (that was him, right?) and I knew who Harry was because I saw the episode where Charlotte got her divorce and I even saw part of an episode where she was disgusted with his body hair.  I actually had never seen an episode with Mr. Big, but everyone knows who he is (I have seen an episode with Aiden, so I was missing him).  I had no clue who Samantha's man was.Here's the thing, this film just doesn't have a lot going for it.I know that enthusiasts of the show itself will have a problem with me saying that, but I'm just being honest.  From my personal perspective (and maybe it's because I didn't follow the show) I just didn't see what all the fuss was about.  I thought that the wit, while present at times, was overall rather corny and underdeveloped and I felt that the chemistry between the actors was rather nonexistent.  Sure, the inner queen in me (it is a small queen, but she is there) was totally interested in what everyone was wearing, but aside from that I was kind of bored.  Certain aspects of the films plot I actually felt a minor connection to (I actually just endured the very thing Miranda and Steve go through, so I understood both sides of that case and loved the way it was resolved) but overall I found everyone so whiney and unlikable.  Miranda herself was unforgiving and hypocritical; Charlotte was underdeveloped and forgettable (and her constant reflection on her own `great and wonderful' marriage was rather pathetic); Samantha was somewhat engaging but overall a tad obnoxious and Carrie, well, she was probably the most likable character, unless you count Harry's pining over the women in his life (how sweet!).I know I'm going to be hated for this.I found the plot to be rather formulaic (I won't give it away for anyone who hasn't seen the film) and the script itself felt clich&eacute;d and amateurish.  I mean, was the entire series like this?  If so then I don't understand that HUGE following, unless you are watching it solely for the nudity and fashion sense (ha, watch for the clothes and for the lack there of).The acting was decent, with Sarah Jessica Parker taking the `best in show' mention (as I expected).

1179844,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B001DDBCUA,Andy Orrock,"[5, 8]","I thought writer/director Michael Patrick King did a fairly good job here delivering a quality product vs. the significant pressure from the audience who pretty much demanded this film.  Who can argue with its success?  Almost $400M in worldwide box office on a production budget of $65M falls well beyond the category of 'rousing success'.  The results dispelled a lot of naysayers predicting that the product couldn't translate to the big screen.I say ""fairly good"" because my quibble with the film come from its almost-complete washing out of its male characters.  Chris Noth's 'Big' has his place of course. But my favorite character, 'Steve' (David Eigenberg), is turned into a one-trick pony as a stammering adulterer.  Eigenberg's Steve was known for his inherent likability, even in the face of an often non-likable Miranda.  I was surprised King would simply cash that in so easily.As for Evan Handler's 'Harry' and Jason Lewis' 'Smith', they're taken out of the picture by King more effectively than any Soviet painter ordered to remove purged Politburo members from the Red Square lineup.

Woodley ""Patroness, Janeites, the Austen list""","[2, 4]","I would rate this about a 1.5 stars, so I have been generous in allowing it 2 here - and that is really only for nostalgia's sake.I found the movie watchable, but not engrossing. All the characters are simply PLASTERED in make up - which might be ok on tv, but on the big screen they look almost grotesque. In britain they have a term about people with too much orange fake tan, having been 'tangoed' - a phrase made famous by a very virulently orange coloured drink. Well these girls have been tangoed = they are overly made up orange people.The storylines just seemed incredibly forced. Carrie is marrying Big - Big gets cold feet, rings her mobile repeatedly (which Carrie has lost) and so the first big premise of the movie is will they or won't they get married.Marriage meanwhile is not giving Cynthia Nixon's character much fun when her husband Steve admits to having an affair, ""it didn't mean anything"" and thank god she just leaves him - BANG - out the door. But then after dragging our way through the whole movie, she goes to counselling. So then there is the whole will she won't she get back together with him. The link in with forgiveness between friends is extremely tenuous - however the script writers boldly make it.Samantha just wants Me time - as everything revolves around her.There is a trip to Mexico, a whole lot of girl talk, scatological humour but the most astonshing part is there appears to be thicker makeup slapped on the faces of these women than there is fat on their backsides. Plus there is plenty of room for endless sequels from this outing - unfortunately. The make up will only get thicker, and the story lines thinner the longer this goes on.

1179865,A3PP64HMEYIGF0,B001DDBCUA,CastleD,"[7, 10]","In this movie, we have narcissistic girls running around obsessed with material items and their own happiness. A mans only purpose in life is to cater to the happiness of these women, but I shouldn't say ""women"" because these are little girls. Spoiled little princesses who think the world revolves around them and their every emotional whim. These girls offer nothing in their relationships with men, and I'm not sure why these guys would stay with them except that they're sadists, or can't get anybody else.There were a few decent and amusing moments in this movie but let's continue ripping it apart because that's more fun.Take notice how long it took Carrie Bradshaw to engage in just a morsel of self-reflection. Ya know, that maybe having a pompous, bridezilla wedding was a major turn off to Mr. Big? He wanted to marry HER, because he loved HER, and the wedding is just a fun formality. To Carrie, the wedding is everything. She was not marrying Mr. Big, she was marrying herself, because that's all these entitled princesses care about, is themselves and their own well-being. The guy is just another accessory like one of their overpriced Louis Vuitton handbags.The guys in the movie? Forget it. Cynthia Nixon's husband is...wow, the guy appears to be mentally challenged. I mean literally. As per usual there wasn't an ounce of masculinity in this guy. Kristin Davis' husband is another non-entity. A guy with no edge, very little masculinity, and is just another servant to his wife's needs. This is standard now for many TV sitcoms, commercials, and some Hollywood movies in our society's decades long effort to turn men into obedient little fems.Mr. Big isn't too bad, but believe me, the guy is a fool. Carrie is a very successful woman, why is he buying her all this stuff? Is he purchasing her love? Spoiling these brats does not make them love you more. He decides to marry her because she complains that she didn't have any ""legal rights"" as a couple living together. In other words Mr. Big, if we split up, I can legally rake you over the coals and rob you blind in divorce court, where men have no rights. And what does he say? ""Okay let's get married."" Lol. What an absolute fool.Oh and of course there were a few fabulous gay characters as well. The only real guy was Samantha's boyfriend who didn't seem wimpy, but apparently was getting bored of banging her or something. And when she wanted to leave him, he was like ""okay, that's cool"". He didn't seem too bothered by it, which is not surprising. Why stay with an emotional and intellectual black hole like Samantha who offers nothing expect that she happens to have a vaj.I know these people are meant to be caricatures and it's a parody of rich women in NYC... but is it? I think this is the feminist, gay Hollywood fantasy. This movie is what we are left with after decades of feminism. Entitled, selfish princesses and their wimpy male enablers devoid of masculinity because we've beaten it out of them. A mans only purpose is to serve women. Eff that. I realize there are still good women out there, but none of them are in this movie.",2,Girlzillas.

1179869,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001DDBCUA,Chris Pandolfi,"[8, 24]","I knew I was out of my league the instant I stepped into the theater. It was packed with people, and I could tell from their nonstop chatter that they had been eagerly awaiting the theatrical release of ""Sex and the City."" Watching it, I didn't know whether to envy or feel sorry for these people, who all laughed and cheered and applauded while I sat there, idly wondering what they were finding so enjoyable. This film adaptation of the HBO TV series was one of the longest two-and-a-half hours I've spent at the movies this year, and that's mostly because it didn't need to be two-and-a-half hours. This movie is as over-inflated as the characters themselves, some of the most annoying, artificial, selfish women ever conceived of. They're not stylistic interpretations of real people, but merely walking, talking delusions of grandeur, ones we could never live no matter how hard we try.In case you're wondering about the person writing this review, let me confirm your suspicions by outing myself as someone who hasn't watched the show. Not a single episode. I went to this movie hoping the filmmakers would take people like me into consideration, people who can enter completely cold yet still get something out of it. There's nothing more frustrating than a movie that can't stand on its own, can't distance itself from its roots and give us something fresh and exciting. What we get with ""Sex and the City"" is a droning compendium of witty dialogue, comedic situations, romantic melodrama, and references to fashion designers, all while showcasing people that don't even have fragments of truth in them--most of the characters are desperately needy caricatures, going through life spending money on shoes and handbags and dresses and catered affairs. Anyone can have a fantasy about living the good life, but it takes more than a montage of designer wedding dresses to actually relate to it.Much like ""Moulin Rouge,"" the story of ""Sex and the City"" is, above all things, about love, only it takes place in New York City instead of Paris. What has become of the relationship between writer Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her boyfriend, John James Preston, a.k.a., Mr. Big (Chris Noth)? What's been happening with the oversexed Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), especially since she's been living with her model/actor boyfriend, Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis), in Los Angeles? Are Charlotte York (Kristen Davis) and her husband, Harry Goldenblatt (Evan Handler), still happy together? Are Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon) and her husband, Steve Brady (David Eigenberg), on the verge of divorce?All these questions were answered at one point or another. What wasn't answered was the number of other questions that popped into my head. For one thing, how many frequent flyer miles is Samantha racking up between Los Angeles and New York City? She goes back and forth so frequently it's a wonder she has time to discuss the miracles of Botox with Carrie. And why did Samantha take Carrie on a trip to Mexico knowing it would be a painful reminder of Carrie's current situation (I won't say more than that)? A true friend would never do that, just as a true friend would never make fun of someone for an unwaxed bikini line. On that Mexico trip, Miranda has to endure Samantha's ridicule for not keeping her pubic hair in check; it was a scene that thought it was funnier than it actually was, much like when Charlotte gets dysentery and has ... well, a little accident. Most of the audience saw the humor in that, so I guess contrived toilet humor still has its place.So do over the top sexual references. Take Samantha's dog: she lovingly adopts it because it constantly masturbates. The agent tells her that it hasn't lost the urge, despite having been spayed. This is what counts for funny nowadays? Bottom-of-the-barrel gags like this belong in teenage spoofs, not in romantic comedies. Indeed, this movie probably would have worked much better as a spoof, seeing as the main characters are too broadly drawn to be anything other than inside jokes. There are, in fact, only two tolerable characters in this film. One is Miranda; despite being shallow and cynical, she's the most realistic of the four women. She seems to have genuine life problems. That being said, her sarcastic tone of voice is tiresome at the very start: when Charlotte says that Brooklyn is the new Manhattan, Miranda responds, ""Whoever said that lives in Brooklyn.""The other character is Louise (Jennifer Hudson), who's eventually hired as Carrie's assistant. Louise is from St. Louis, and like many young girls, she's moved to New York to fall in love again. She believes so strongly in love that she actually carries a keychain of the word at all times. Can Carrie learn a thing or two from this clear-eyed young woman? I don't see why anyone would care one way or the other--the entire premise of ""Sex and the City"" is so phony that any outcome fails to be meaningful. There's a moment late in the film when the four friends attend a fashion show, and as we all know, runway models are nothing more than hangers to advertise the designer outfits. This movie is much like that fashion show, all faades and no depth, displaying outrageous styles that no one in the real world appreciates. There's only one thing I appreciated: the scene that reintroduces the Cosmopolitan. It's a great reminder that alcohol is the only thing that can get you through this movie.",2,Material Girls,1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,5445,"['knew', 'was', 'league', 'instant', 'stepped',

1179878,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B001DDBCUA,Daryl B,"[5, 6]","More often than not, the transition from the small to the big screen is a huge disappointment.  The last decade has seen many television series made into film but very few have translated well.  HBO's hit series, ""Sex and the City"" is the rare exception!Three years after the series left off, we find the fab foursome moving along in their lives.  Miranda and Steve have settled in Brooklyn with their son, Brady.  Charlotte is living happily with her husband and adopted daughter, Lily.  Samantha has moved to the West Coast with her hunky partner, Smith, who now has a starring role on television.  And Carrie, well, she is searching for the perfect apartment with Big.All seems just a little too perfect until the complications set in---infidelity, a stagnant relationship, wedding jitters and much more challenge the four friends we have grown to love.  Over six seasons we watched as these women dealt with sex and relationships.  This movie, of course, continues that journey but also begins a new chapter in their lives.Many of the familiar faces have returned; however some are underused in the movie.  Stanford, Carrie's best gay bud, is given little more than a cameo and receives about the same amount of screen time as Magda, Miranda's nanny.  Oscar winner, Jennifer Hudson (and American Idol alum), plays new character, Louise, Carrie's assistant--a young woman who loves purses as much as Carrie loves her shoes!  Candice Bergen also makes a cameo as Carrie's editor at Vogue.One thing I will never understand, though, is a lot of women's desire to see Carrie with Big.  I've always found the character arrogant, narcissitic and emotionally detached.  Granted, Carrie is neurotic and a high maitenance gal but their torturous relationship has always bordered on sadistic.  Apparently, some women find that type of guy attractive or they just love the constant drama in their relationships.  Whatever the case, Big will always be the one flaw in an otherwise enjoyable show/movie.Thankfully most of the elements that made the series a hit are found in the film.  Samantha's zingers provide some great laughs and, of course, there is plenty of relationship talk.  The chemistry that made these four women a regular Sunday night fixture on HBO is also found on the big screen.  During a summer of big budget action/superhero films, ""Sex"" is a nice addition for all those who want a little diversion from exploding buildings and flying action heroes.So for all of you who enjoyed the series, you will not be disappointed!  And if you didn't watch, I think you will still enjoy the movie.  A great date night movie!

For ""purists"" includes both original theatrical & unrated extended versions. Packaged to look like a wedding photo album, this set is class and quality all the way. Here's what you will find as far as the 4 discs go:Disc 1:* Extended cut of the movie with director commentaryDisc 2:Special features & digital copy including:* A Conversation w/SJP & Michael Patrick King* The Fabulous Fashion of Sex and the City: A detailed look at Patricia Field's fantastic creations, from dresses to purses to shoes.* Additional Scenes with optional director commentary* Fergie in the Studio: watch Fergie record the title track for the movie soundtrack.* Putting Sex on Screen: Learn the challenges of putting the TV show onto the ""big ' (pun intended) screen.* The Ladies of Sex & The City: exploring the lead characters, accessory by accessory.* The Making of Sex and the City: Experience an insider's view of the film shoot.Disc 3:Additional special features including:* SJP & MPK: The Complete Conversation - Feature-length commentary of the Theatrical version of the film exploring their experiences in making the movie. This is very cool; with a constantly changing frame-within-frame format that has both the movie and SJP/MPK talking, it adds the extra visual dimension to the standard commentary format. There is a menu for each scene so that you can go directly to your favorite scene to hear/see SJP/MPK's commentary.* The Party That Never Was: Exclusive converage of the DVD launch event at the NY Public Libary. Since Carrie's original vision of her wedding at the NY Public Library ""never was,"" the DVD launch party carried the theme through. This is really an incredible look at the planning of this media event. 3 out of 4 of the leads made it to the party; Kristin Davis was in the Carolinas launching her fashion line apparently. The classical NY landmark is transformed into a pink homage to the movie, complete with gigantic Carrie-brides on stilts (with the bluebird in their veils, of course!).* The Wedding Dress Photo Shoot: spend an entire day with SJP in preparation for the Vogue wedding dress shoot. To make this sequence as authentic as possible, nothing but Vogue staff were used to style SJP in this classic scene. A nice behind the scenes look.Disc 4 (A music CD):* 8-song compilation: All Dressed in Love (Jennifer Hudson), The Show (Lenka), Happy (Natasha Bedingfield), Mockingbird (Alison Moorer), Was Love (Eugene), Sex & The City Movie Theme (Pfeifer Broz. Orchestra), Labels or Love (without Fergie, exactly as heard over the movie titles), Aaron Zigman Score Suite.In addition to the DVDs/CD, you get:* A hardcover photo book that is different fromSex and the City the Movie. This volume is BEAUTIFUL; so well done! Contains subtle spot varnish on almost every page (an additional cost that pays off in the look), excellent photography featuring scenes from the movie, and a mixture of the ""love quotes"" as well as quotes from the movie. An excellent keepsake.* An individually numbered certificate of authenticity designed to look like a huge wedding invitation, complete with transparent parchment sheet containing the limited edition number.Specs: English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, Anamorphic Widescreen  1.85:1No Blu-ray version of this set is available yet.",5,Collector's Edition Is Amazing!,1225584000,"11 2, 2008",2008,3546,"['was', 'little', 'ticked', 'off', 'when', 'read', 'announcement', 'collector', 'edition', 'was', 'being', 'released', 'so', 'quickly', 'initial', 'release', 'ofSex', 'City', 'Movie', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Warners', 'gone', 'out', 'putting', 'one', 'together', 'purists', 'original', 'theatrical', 'unrated', 'extended', 'versions', 'Packaged', 'look', 'wedding', 'photo', 'album', 'set', 'class', 'quality', 'way', 'Here', 'what', 'will', 'find', 'as', 'far', '4', 'discs', 'go', 'Disc', '1', '*', 'Extended', 'cut', 'movie', 'director', 'commentaryDisc', '2', 'Special', 'features', 'digital', 'copy', 'including', '*', 'Conversation', 'w/SJP', 'Michael', 'Patrick', 'King*', 'Fabulous', 'Fashion', 'Sex', 'City', 'detailed', 'look', 'Patricia', 'Field', 'fantastic', 'creations', 'dresses', 'purses', 'shoes', '*', 'Additional', 'Scenes', 'optional', 'director', 'commentary*', 'Fergie', 'Studio', 'watch', 'Fergie', 'record', 'title', 'track', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'Putting', 'Sex', 'Screen', 'Learn', 'challenges', 'putting', 'TV', 'show', 'big', 'pun', 'intended', 'screen', '*', 'Ladies', 'Sex', 'City', 'exploring', 'lead', 'characters', 'accessory', 'accessory', '*', 'Making', 'Sex', 'City', 'Experience', 'insider', 'view', 'film', 'shoot.Disc', '3', 'Additional', 'special', 'features', 'including', '*', 'SJP', 'MPK', 'Complete', 'Conversation', 'Feature-length', 'commentary', 'Theatrical', 'version', 'film', 'exploring', 'experiences', 'making', 'movie', 'very', 'cool', 'constantly', 'changing', 'frame-within-frame', 'format', 'movie', 'SJP/MPK', 'talking', 'extra', 'visual', 'dimension', 'standard', 'commentary', 'format', 'menu', 'scene', 'can', 'go', 'directly', 'favorite', 'scene', 'hear/see', 'SJP/MPK', 'commentary', '*', 'Party', 'That', 'Never', 'Was', 'Exclusive', 'converage', 'DVD', 'launch', 'event', 'NY', 'Public', 'Libary', 'Carrie', 'original', 'vision', 'wedding', 'NY', 'Public', 'Library', 'never', 'was', 'DVD', 'launch', 'party', 'carried', 'theme', 'really', 'incredible', 'look', 'planning', 'media', 'event', '3', '4', 'leads', 'made', 'party', 'Kristin', 'Davis', 'was', 'Carolinas', 'launching', 'fashion', 'line', 'apparently', 'classical', 'NY', 'landmark', 'transformed', 'pink', 'homage', 'movie', 'complete', 'gigantic', 'Carrie-brides', 'stilts', 'bluebird', 'veils', 'course', '*', 'Wedding', 'Dress', 'Photo', 'Shoot', 'spend', 'entire', 'day', 'SJP', 'preparation', 'Vogue', 'wedding', 'dress', 'shoot', 'make', 'sequence', 'as', 'authentic', 'possible', 'nothing', 'Vogue', 'staff', 'were', 'used', 'style', 'SJP', 'classic', 'scene', 'nice', 'scenes', 'look.Disc', '4', 'music', 'CD', '*', '8-song', 'compilation', 'Dressed', 'Love', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'Show', 'Lenka', 'Happy', 'Natasha', 'Bedingfield', 'Mockingbird', 'Alison', 'Moorer', 'Was', 'Love', 'Eugene', 'Sex', 'City', 'Movie', 'Theme', 'Pfeifer', 'Broz', 'Orchestra', 'Labels', 'Love', 'Fergie', 'exactly', 'heard', 'movie', 'titles', 'Aaron', 'Zigman', 'Score', 'Suite.In', 'addition', 'DVDs/CD', 'get', '*', 'hardcover', 'photo', 'book', 'different', 'fromSex', 'City', 'Movie', 'volume', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'Contains', 'subtle', 'spot', 'varnish', 'almost', 'page', 'additional', 'cost', 'look', 'excellent', 'photography', 'featuring', 'scenes', 'movie', 'mixture', 'love', 'quotes', 'as', 'well', 'quotes', 'movie', 'excellent', 'keepsake', '*', 'individually', 'numbered', 'certificate', 'authenticity', 'designed', 'look', 'huge', 'wedding', 'invitation', 'complete', 'transparent', 'parchment', 'sheet', 'containing', 'limited', 'edition', 'number.Specs', 'English', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'Anamorphic', 'Widescreen', '1.85:1No', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'set', 'available', 'yet']",N/A

It was completely out of place since they were trying to create something not needed here.  Hudson's character contributed nothing to the storyline since Miranda, Charlotte etc were her support system.  I would have suggested they could have just found an obscure actress to play this role.

1179883,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001DDBCUA,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 8]","SEX AND THE CITY THE MOVIE was definitely a highly anticipated film of 2008.  A lot of my female friends and guy friends are fans of the HBO television series and even my wife was so hardcore that she and her female friends would have viewing parties every night the new episodes were shown.For me, I've always enjoyed the series for it's in-depth look at love and relationships via the women's perspective, as much as I loved BBC America's look at love and relationships via the comedy ""Coupling"".The series definitely took on a variety of topics, especially of how it related to the characters and the topics of love and sex were just hilarious, emotional and overall uplifting.With the highly anticipated film reuniting the women four years since the series, we see Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), who has three successful books on love and still dating and very much love with Mr. Big (Chris Noth).  The two are in the next step of their relationship about to move into an awesome apartment with an awesome closet but most of all, the two finally ready to tie the knot.Samantha (Kim Cattrall) living in Hollywood to manage her model/boyfriend's career and missing New York City.  Samantha is missing her former life of having fun and being the center of attention.For Charlotte (Kristin Davis), Charlotte and husband are still happy and raising their adoptive daughter.And Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), very busy with her job as a lawyer and as a parent but at the same time, somewhat neglecting her wife duties.Without spoiling the storylines for each of these women, throw in some major wrenches to the lives of these women and you definitely get one sensational story about love, finding love, losing love and most of all to see the friendships of these four women tested.Like the show, you get beautiful scenes of New York City and the beautiful settings.  Also, the interesting and at times outlandish but most of the time elegant fashion courtesy of costume designer Patricia Field.  Also, the musical setting of hearing Mairi Campbell's ""Auld Lange Syne"" to Run DMC's ""Walk this Way"" and various music as it plays an emotional and enjoyable setting for the various segments of the film.But what makes this movie work is the well written storyline by Michael Patrick King who knows how to really balance each of the women's storylines but effectively writes a film that not only will women enjoy it but also men.I have to give credit to another woman on the show who actually plays a significant role on the film.  Jennifer Hudson's character as an assistant to Carrie Bradshaw definitely added a cool character component as a woman also looking for love in New York City, rents her designer bags but most of all, how she helps Carrie through a difficult time.Nearly every character from the TV series had such an important role although I was surprised Stanford (Willie Garson) didn't have that many lines.SPECIAL FEATURES:There are various versions of this DVD from the two-disc set and also the Blu-Ray editions which feature may special features.

1179884,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B001DDBCUA,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[6, 8]","Forgive the unimaginative title to this review--its an unforgivable line straight from the script--but I can't think of anything else to call my comments with regard to Michael Patrick King's ""Sex and the City: the Movie.""  A reluctant fan of the show--I never did see all the episodes making up all six seasons--I regarded the series as an empowered woman's fairytale featuring four willing and able young women that seemed to achieve more orgasms over those fetching five-inch heeled shoes than the revolving door of men that seemed positioned confusingly either as the object of their obsessions or simply an unnecessary high caloric dessert after an extremely filling meal of life, liberty and the pursuit of designer labels.  Regardless of my preconceived notions `Sex and the City: the Movie"" converts from small screen to big screen successfully with nary a hair out of place.  To those of us who have benchmarked time with the dissolution of relationships between friends and family members, the film drives home the very real point that the cohesion between two people is not only complicated and fragile, but also facilitated by its witnesses.  As a New Yorker living far away from my birthplace, I wished my lifelong friends were closer so that we, too, could enjoy intense moments of pain and joy like the four women in the film.Now doesn't that seem serious for something meant to be as light and airy as pink spun sugar purchased at a stand in Central Park?  Don't get me wrong:  the film dazzles with some of the craziest fashions ever assembled by Patricia Field--my personal favorite?  Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) in a big navy blue theme t-shirt and over the knee argyle socks--yuck!  The women apparently earn oodles of money - Samantha alone manages some of the plot's stickier financial snafus with just a whisk of her fairy godmother magic wand.  Fantasy does abound with the never-ending stream of high-ticket social events and invites that require appearing in a little more than that reserve `little black dress.' Dispersing cold cash for just one of those wildly colorful outfits alone in the current high-priced gas crisis would probably mean choking over fish heads and rice for an entire month for the average off-the-rack wearing bread-winner. However, no matter what these women don or what parties they attend--and I doubt they could be more spectacular or showy--the imperfectness of the human condition comes into cold play.  Are we ever really satisfied and do we know what really is important?In its splashy Carrie-narrated way, this intentionally silly film about New York and its ladies manages to hit a major home run.  Unexpectedly, Sarah Jessica Parker, with her elongated face that only Modigliani or Picasso could love, exhibits nuanced emotions that immediately connects her with the audience.  She's pencil thin and can wear all those kooky outfits with panache, but somehow she makes liking her and rooting for her effortless.  Are we jealous of her?  No, we empathize.  Even when she has it all, she doesn't have it all.  She may be in a different tax-bracket but her problems can be the theme in a country-western song. There's no pretty ribbon, shoe buckle or marathon-long closet that catches all the loose ends for her.  The morals faced in this tale are as old as those in Aesop's Fables: happiness may be ephemeral but it does recycle; catch it while you can and enjoy it. On a secondary level, the holistic synergy between the four friends is warmly palpable and more valuable than the $50K-plus diamond ring Samantha covets; they all have their own lives, yet marshal their limited time to constantly and sometimes unrealistically connect.  Somehow as horrendously formulaic as all this sounds, the film delivers its message while also working as an entertainment.Some reviewers have intimated that none of this materialistic focus on the likes of Louis Vuitton handbags and Manolo Blahnik shoes works after the terrorist attacks of September 11th.  This certainly is not true.  Superficial, it may be, but the film delivers a sense of a strong New York presence--so very important for this New Yorker who hasn't been home since 1999.The film's only real liability is in the way it conveys its sense of men.  As entrepreneur and savvy man-about-town `Big,' Chris Noth seems paralyzed--literally nauseated--unable to speak to a woman that he professes to know after ten years of being in an `adult' relationship.  Likewise, the other significant others appear as adjuncts to their uber-women, minding their own business, tongue-tied in the face of so much power.  Only Miranda's husband, Steve (David Eigenberg,) vibrates occasionally with a spark of egalitarian concern for a marriage tottering in the wasteland of domesticity.  We expect, of course, the beefcakes:  these are well appreciated--the inverse of the usual average male finds supermodel cinematic daydream.A lesser annoyance factor comes in the guise of a gutsy Girl Friday hired by Carrie to get her life back in ABC order.  Add to that the superficial weight comments directed at Samantha's visibly larger gut.  Oh well.Bottom line?  Designer labels and delightful New York events star in this continuation of the lives of the four sexually uninhibited icons of 21st century life.  The stories, infused with emotionally charged angst and frustration are certainly not recommended for anyone who did not like the television series of the same name. The romances here depicted reek with a certain amount of bewildered despair.  However, anyone who has `made it' in terms of career and financial security like the women in the film may ask that quintessential question, ""Is that all there is?"" and hear a resounding open-ended ""Yes, but . . ."" and roll with the punches.  Fun and fanciful, this sequel plays well in terms of fun, delivering what is expected with a little extra.  Love those shoes.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",4,Carried Away,1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,5950,"['Forgive', 'unimaginative', 'title', 'review', 'unforgivable', 'line', 'straight', 'script',

When the big wedding/big dress came, I thought ""wow, that's generally the climatic ending"" and so was not totally unsurprised that Big choked.  Anyhoo ... everybody has loads of money and can fly around the world at the drop of a hat (or the jilting of a bride.)  That's nice ... and totally unbelievable.  When Charlotte had her ""accident"" in Mexico, even my husband commented ""laughing at that is just mean""; I wouldn't want my friends laughing at me for something so deeply humiliating.  Carrie was just as good as deflecting blame away from herself as ever; when Miranda finally tells her she told Big they were crazy to get married, Carrie acts like THAT was the reason he didn't show up for the wedding.  I REALLY didn't like her character much after that.  But in the end, everybody lives happily ever after and/or reverts back to type: Carrie & Big are together, Miranda & Steve reconcile; Charlotte finally has a biological child; and Samantha is happily on her own.

1179887,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B001DDBCUA,Doug Anderson,"[7, 13]","In the HBO drama, Carrie Bradshaw wrote a weekly column, and each show was the culmination of approximately one week's worth of revelations on the pros and cons of wanting it all. The show was not about the struggle to achieve financial independence for Carrie & her friends each already had their dream jobs, rather the show was about the love lives of successful, albeit single, thirty-something women. But the show was also more than that and it gained its massive following not just because it was entertaining and witty and clever about the way the spritely-but-wise Carrie juggled her career & romance goals, but because Carrie asked the kinds of questions that were on the minds of many other women. Plus, because it was often so frank and said out loud what had not been said out loud on tv before, the show was just plain fun. Even guys, on occasion, liked it. Carrie was not Godard, or Woody Allen, but she got women and couples talking and kept them talking (Godard and Woody Allen fans probably counted the show as a guilty pleasure). It was pop culture with just the right amount of substance to keep you entertained and interested in equal measures.Also, the series was cleverly constructed so that Carrie, the writer, could view the life of the single woman and the issues that concerned her from four distinct angles/perspectives. Each character may have been asking the same or similar questions about striking the right balance between maintaining an independent identity and finding (and maintaining) a lasting romantic connection, but each character answered those questions in their own way, and no single answer was ever offered as the best or definitive one. The show was always about pursuing ideals & dreams but it was also always about acknowledging that not every girl & woman has an identical set of ideals & dreams, and so personal and professional ""success"" was something that each was compelled to work out for themselves. The sex itself may have been the allure that brought both sexes to the tv every Sunday night, but the series allowed women that gathered to watch the show together to laugh at things that real women laugh at and it allowed men an invaluable glimpse into the dynamics of the feminine mind/mystique, and all in a provocative way. The show examined existing social norms & standards & expectations, and, more importantly, it provided women with new norms & standards & expectations. It gave women new ways to read their lives and never settled on any one prescriptive method or model for how a girl or woman ought to think, act, look, or feel: its inclusiveness & openness were two of the shows greatest appeals & virtues. It validated a new kind of women, it made the career woman feel good about being a career women, and it made women feel powerful and smart and sexy and fun all at the same time. I must admit I did not watch every episode but the ones I did, sometimes reluctantly, watch, I enjoyed. The show was a guilty pleasure. ""Guilty"" because guys aren't supposed to like the show and I liked it. I like smart women and at least two of these women (Carrie and Miranda) were smart. And the other two (Samantha and Charlotte) sexy.Opening Night: Miami. My girlfriend bought tickets for this premiere several days ago so I was there on opening night in line in jeans with my girlfriend and a lot of other very well dressed women (many in groups of four) who'd just consumed a round or two of Cosmopolitans. I'm guessing I was the only straight guy in this very lively, very eager, very excitable line. This generation of women was raised on Madonna in high school and then graduated to Sex and the City in college. I was wondering when the next paradigm shift in the world of feminist/postfeminist pop culture would occur and what that might look like when the line, finally, began to move.Ok, the film: I will not spoil the film for those who haven't had a chance to see it yet, but I will say that the film does not mess with the formula that made the series a hit. Carrie & Samantha & Miranda & Charlotte are all in their 40's now (and Samantha even hits 50), but they all still look, well, as good as they did in their 30's so age is not an issue. The revelation of the film is that there are no revelations: the same concerns & questions that Carrie was asking in seasons one through six of the series are still on these characters minds and still remain unanswered; what has changed, albeit ever so slightly, is that each of the characters seems to have learned to live more comfortably with those  questions and concerns. I will not discuss the plot, but I will say that the main difference between the series and the film is that if the series was about women in the process of defining & empowering themselves in new ways in a more open era; the film is about women who have successfully defined and empowered themselves but are still capable of self-surprise and thus still required to make life-altering decisions. I won't discuss the plot so that you can experience those moments of self-surprise and those choices while watching the film. I will say that because this film does not try to offer any definitive resolutions for any of these character's lives (or the lives of girls & women in general), but instead shows that the continued re-examination of one's life and the continually renewed effort to invent new ways to live it is what keeps life interesting and dynamic, this translation of Sex & the City from the small to the big screen is an unqualified success.That, added to the fact that these women can find a way to laugh and have fun in the best of times as well as the worst of times (and theres plenty of both in this film), is yet another reason groups of women, couples, and singles will find this film immensely satisfying. Yes, theres a lot of fantasy (fashion, parties, shopping) that seems like a foreign language to some of us, but theres also a lot of raw emotion too and plenty that most of us can relate to. The fantasy element (especially the outlandish fashion) seems to turn some people off, but it functions in much the same way Carrie's wit functions: it is a way of coping, a way of transcending old ways of thinking/being, and it is a way of being inventive & original. All qualities that this series and film celebrate.The fans love it, but the critics, male and female, apparently aren't liking it (most critical reviews have been awarding the film approximately 2.5 out of 4.0). The critics may be right to pick at a few missteps but overall I think many of them are missing the point. Sex and the City is not pretending to be great cinema/art, the show never took itself that seriously nor does the film. Sex and the City was and is pop culture, but its pop culture that occasionally sneaks in some valuable social critique. The show and film have moments where the conspicuous consumption becomes annoying and these are the moments that seem grossly excessive and unproductive and wasteful, but also moments where the characters take control and creatively produce their lives. Some critics seem only to see the icing, and not the cake.So, will there be another movie? And, if so, what will these characters be doing in another five years?*Charlotte will probably have a whole mess of kids, some adopted and some biological. Prep schools & cute outfits (for the children) will be her main concern for the next two decades. Being so perfect herself, she will probably have issues with the more rebellious of her brood.*Samantha's mellow spell will not last. She will have to think of new and creative ways to manage her appetites. Once she loses her ability to attract young men with her own wiles, she may have to resort to renting them.*Miranda will tire of any man that is not as dedicated to his career as she is to hers. She's yet to meet her match, but will meet someone who she enjoys being with more than she enjoys being with the girls.*Carrie the independent with intimacy/commitment issues will not have an easy go of it with Big who has the exact same set of issues. The two will decide they get along best when apart.",5,A Guilty Pleasure,1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,8139,"['HBO', 'drama', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'wrote', 'weekly', 'column', 'show', 'was',

1179888,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B001DDBCUA,Douglas King,"[3, 7]","I enjoyed the ""Sex and the City"" series, which chronicled the lives of four successful single women in New York City. The series ended its 7 season run gracefully, with the characters evolving from (mostly) 30-something, slightly self-absorbed singles to mature women embracing mature relationships and, in some cases, motherhood.The most frustating thing about the ""Sex and the City"" movie is that, although five years have gone by, these characters do not seem to have evolved at all. If anything, they seem to have backslid into the same immature cycles that they were in during the series. Once again, Carrie is jilted by committment-phobe Mr. Big, then takes him back. Once again, Miranda harshly rejects Steve after he makes a mistake, then takes him back. Once again, Samantha realizes that she's just not the type of person meant for a traditional, monogamous relationship. The only character who seems to have really grown up is Charlotte, who is flourishing in a strong marriage and as a mother. But her character is given little to do, other than comfort the other three women as they continue wallowing in self-inflicted misery.On a superficial note, fashion was always a big part of the ""Sex and the City"" series, and the clothes always towed the line between stylish and over-the-top. But the outfits in this movie are hideous ... hardly a scene passed by where I didn't find myself thinking ""What the hell ...?""Although it was nice to see the actresses and characters reunited, let's hope the sequel has a better script, and that these characters are given the chance to grow and evolve.

1179889,A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL,B001DDBCUA,Dr. Cathy Goodwin,"[2, 4]","Taken at face value, the movie is seriously flawed. Carrie, Samantha and Miranda make unreasonable demands on their significant others. Samantha and Carrie don't understand when their spouses have to work late. Miranda doesn't have time for Steve (but she has time to go off to Mexico with the girls and help Carrie move). They whine a lot and don't listen to their partners. The men (especially ""Big"") are...well, nice. We don't see a lot of male ego.Then there's the lack of mundane reality. Carrie is supposed to be a writer but she lives the lifestyle of an entertainer. And so on.But SATC was always about fantasy. The show always exaggerated. Remember Carrie's book party? The fashions were always over the top. The women never had families. New York was like an extra character in the show -- ab beautiful city that these women enjoyed to the fullest. And except for Samantha's bout with cancer, nobody really suffered.So...once you're willing to suspend disbelief and see the movie as mildly amusing satire, it's a lot of fun, with some old-fashioned sentiment mixed in (the New Year's Eve montage of improbably lonely people). The plot is driven by coincidences and accident, not strong characters. I'd have liked to see more of Sanford Blatch and the wedding planner. I wish all the subplots didn't involve the same type of relationship issues; the TV episodes were more creative. We could have done without the ""bathroom humor."" The Jennifer Hudson character was likeable and cute but not strong or funny.What makes this DVD 4-stars rather than 3 is Michael King's commentary. He loves the characters and the actors. I think he's a little bit in love with Sarah Jessica Parker.  He points out nuances and symbols I missed the first time around. He manages to suggest a show that has some substance underneath the fluff.Most of all he points out, the show doesn't end the way we would expect. I liked that. I liked seeing the women aging. There's a shot of Carrie looking totally distressed, every line carved into her face.It could have been worse. A lot worse.

1179890,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B001DDBCUA,Dr. E,"[42, 81]","Perhaps because I so adore the television-series, I so loathe this big-screen debacle.Let's start with ""the small stuff"": the heinous product-placement. I'm not talking about the Manolos, the Louis Vuitton, or the Dior (that's not ""product-placement,"" that's love of haute couture) ... I am talking about the ubiquitous Vitamin Waters, the close-up of Carrie's new Sprint phone, the shopping-bags from Bluefly (and if you've never shopped Bluefly, you should know it's a ""designer outlet"" ... as in last year's Prada-rejects ... decidedly not ""Carrie""). It is insulting to be bombarded with these pedestrian (if not ""bargain-basement"") items that have little relevance to the work. Take note, Michael Patrick King: your audience picks-up on these things. Try a more subtle approach in the future.Now, steady yourself for the real criticism: the writing. Once clever and witty, the film adopts an entirely low-brow tone. Gone are the double-entendres and witty retorts ... instead King has given us only the basest of conversation. (Without any nuance in the script, Samantha becomes especially abhorrent and Charlotte, a bit dim-witted). In the most unforgivable moment, the writing sinks to an extended ""bodily-function"" joke (no spoilers). It is bizarre and debasing. (When Miranda had her own mishap while changing Brady's diaper, it was funny and real ... when it happens between adult women, well, it seems like something a teenage boy would write). Yuck. (And, I'm not entirely convinced that one's more cosmopolitan friends would find it amusing).And while I'm not opposed to ""low-brow"" (hey, I dig Will Farrell films), I AM opposed to hack. Here's what I learned from King's ""illuminating"" writing: 1.) children repeat words they hear adults say, 2.) children are messy eaters, 3.) Jennifer Hudson is well endowed 4.) and ""illegal Cuban"" cigars are the best. Thank you for repeatedly stating the obvious in the most stilted, awkward manner possible. And all the ado with the ""love"" key-chain ... gag. Oh, and King, the auction-scene ... it's been done a THOUSAND times! (See: The Cosby Show: ""The Auction""). That PAINFULLY PREDICTABLE moment ranks as the second-most unforgivable moment of the work. Bottom-line, I was struck breathless by the surface-writing (to the point of absolute frustration).Writing aside, King's struggle to transition from television to film was evident. The direction and framing were fairly sloppy (occasionally, I was unsure where King wanted my eye to focus). And the ""Honeymoon segment"" ... I was instantly catapulted back to ""bad"" on-location sitcoms ... the shots in Mexico reminded me of ""The Brady Bunch: Hawaii Bound"": bad color, very bad sound, horrendous approach all-together.Had this film been thoughtful and fun, the TWO HOURS AND TWENTY-EIGHT minutes would have been a joy. Instead, every second that elapsed destroyed the memory of a genuinely great television series. (And, it must be said that this was not a problem with the actors -- who gave their best. This was a problem with script/direction/production). At this epic run-time, why didn't the cast and crew just invest in a reunion season??!! (They could have slowed-down the production a little and genuinely focused on an honest, compelling story).This film currently has a giant ""SPLAT!"" at Rottentomatoes ... these are professionals who gave it a 54% approval-rating as of this hour. Many former-fans will not allow themselves to view King's work as anything but pleasant nostalgia ... many will find themselves laughing at the half-hearted jokes and empty-minded comments. But critical viewers (as in, the ""smart-viewers"" that the show once attracted) may walk away angry.

1179891,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B001DDBCUA,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[1, 1]","People have often told me howSex and the City - The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)was meant to be a ""chick flick"" show & I, as a male, had little business in watching it.  Well, chick flick or not, I LOVED the HBO series (so long as it was uncensored & not the TNT version).  So, it was only natural that I would be more than a little bit intrigued by the return of the ladies on the big screen / DVD.Carrie Bradshaw's wedding to Mr. Big is the centerpiece of the film.  While there were many times I thought of Mr. Big as Mr. Big JERK, it's still only fitting that he is ""the one"" whom Carrie is to marry.  From the earliest episodes of the series, Carrie's & Mr. Big's lives weaved in & out of each other.There are a host of subplots as Samantha and Miranda have their own issues to deal with.  Meanwhile, sweet Charlotte has her biggest wish come to fruition.  That's good to see, as Charlotte was always my favorite character on the show.One of the things that makes this movie so poignant is that we already KNOW all of the characters thoroughly.  We know about Carrie's flaws, and we love her anyway.  A great deal of ""character development"" is unnecessary as these are our friends from way-back-when.There have been rumors that there might be a sequel in the works.  I am a little squeamish about that idea as I'm not sure where the story can ""go"" from here.  The original premise was about 4 single women in New York.  Well, 3 of them are now married off.  It seems to me that a sequel would degenerate into its being a ""regular"" run-of-the-mill soap opera, whereas SEX AND THE CITY was always so much more than that.

1179894,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001DDBCUA,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 4]","I can well imagine anyone with only a passing familiarity with the1998-2004 HBO serieswould be bored to tears by a big-screen adaptation that runs an epic-length 148 minutes. I suggest they trust their instincts and stay away, as this 2008 movie is for those of us who appreciated the zeitgeist the show so accurately captured during its run. Focusing on four tightly-knit female friends living the high life in Manhattan, the sitcom was often hilariously ribald. At the same time, the comedy was offset by surprising dramatic elements in tackling issues facing women at the turn of the millennium. Directed and written by Michael Patrick King, who wrote and directed several of the series' turning-point episodes, the movie picks up the quartet of women four years after the last show. Even though the time lapse had more to do with cast salary negotiations, the delay allows an enhancement to the dramatic resonance of the various storylines that a simple continuation could not.For those unaware, the focus is on Carrie Bradshaw, a Manhattan fashionista who has served as a beacon for single women as she moved from New York columnist to contributing Vogue editor. Her best friends are yearning romantic wife-and-mother Charlotte, uptight alpha-lawyer Miranda Hobbes, and lascivious talent manager Samantha Jones. Each character represents an archetype for the contemporary urban woman and has lives that tap into the psyche of its most devoted audience. The plot is expected but reassuring as all the key male characters return as well. Carrie is still seeing the elusive ""Mr. Big"" (whose name was revealed on the last show as John), and in matter-of-fact fashion, they decide to get married. Naturally, since Carrie is the defining icon of single life for her readers, her wedding explodes into a lavish affair complete with a Vivienne Westwood wedding gown. Uncertainty between the couple is the only certainty. Charlotte has already found upscale domestic bliss with her mensch of a divorce lawyer, Harry Goldenblatt, and their adopted daughter Lily.On the left coast, Samantha has miraculously sustained a five-year relationship with much-younger Smith Jerrod, a TV actor whose career she has managed to catapult with her PR savvy. Miranda is still living in Brooklyn with her puppyish bartender husband Steve and their son Brady, but marital problems lurk. King's level-setting of the various situations is blessedly brief during the first part of the movie, and it doesn't take long for all the predicaments to unfold to our rapt attention. All the women are now in their forties (with Samantha verging on fifty) and naturally look fabulous, but they also show how their lives result from choices that they sometimes look back on with understandable doubt. The only one who really doesn't look back is Charlotte, but her much-planned and sought-after happiness becomes a source of guilt and neurosis due to their sisterly bond. There wouldn't seem to be much room for any new characters, but we are presented with Louise, a vivacious girl from St. Louis who gets hired as Carrie's personal assistant.If the film does disappoint, it's probably during the middle which sags a bit, probably because King's approach to the storylines still retains the episodic nature of the series. Moreover, it's a double-edged sword when you have the same cast repeat roles they played for so long on TV. The upside is the instant familiarity, but the downside can be a lack of surprise. Luckily, the actresses fare pretty well on the latter. It honestly feels that every role Sarah Jessica Parker has played in the last decade (The Family Stone,Smart People) comes back intractably to Carrie. There is no question that it's a great, multi-dimensional character that she explores with emotional fluency, and it's refreshing to see her lack of hesitancy in exposing Carrie's unadorned side as well. As Charlotte, Kristin Davis has some of the film's funniest lines, and her perky demeanor remains untarnished. She also has the film's defining sisterly moment when she protects Carrie at her most vulnerable. Cynthia Nixon has the most daunting task in showing the shards of insecurity within the often-embittered Miranda, and she responds with the film's sharpest performance.However, I have to say the scene-stealer remains Kim Cattrall, who has a grand time making Samantha the full embodiment of female empowerment. Samantha's valiant attempts at monogamy are hilarious, and at the same time, age has mellowed her unapologetic character. Unsurprisingly, the men are overshadowed and as characters, rather underdeveloped (by intention, I'm sure). Chris Noth somehow has to bring humanity to a mythic character with perennial cold feet, and David Eigenberg elicits true sympathy to Steve in a most affecting manner. At least Jennifer Hudson shows she has more than Effie (Dreamgirls) in her, though her Louise feels somewhat studied and comes across as a bit more than idealized. A review wouldn't be complete without mention of the film's costume designer Patricia Field (The Devil Wears Prada), who has really defined the look of this show with her audacious fashion sense. Between the clothes, the sharp one-liners, and a quartet of actresses who know their roles outside and in, this marathon candy box of a film won't disappoint fans of the series. Others should stay far, far away.",4,"Like an Old Shoe...an Old, Simply Fabulous Manolo Blahnik Shoe",1213401600,"06 14, 2008",2008,5379,"['can', 'well', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'only', 'passing',

The producers, directors, and stylists who worked on the show all helped make this movie - and it showed. There's a lot of reviews talking about all the great stuff, so I'll talk about some negatives:I'm going to talk about some major plot points and THERE ARE SPOILERS BELOW, SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW, DON'T KEEP READING!1) I loved that Carrie and Big finally got married. I love that he proposed with a a Manolo Blahnik istead of a diamond. I love that Big helps Charlotte with her baby. Here's what I don't love: Big gets all worked up that Carrie plans this big wedding and he can't do it. He doesn't want to be embarassed as he's gotten married twice already. This got me a little steamed. I understand his point and I do think Carrie was going overboard. But, Carrie's never been married and she has the right to have a beautiful wedding and not a quickie at City Hall. There is a compromise between City Hall and the New York City Public Library. A bride should have the wedding of her dreams and Big should have ""manned"" up. So, he ended up getting what he wanted anyway. And speaking of the library, it was one of the things I think that the movie deviated from the show. In the movie, Carrie is apparently obsessed with library books, which leads to the wedding the Library. When, in 6 seasons of the show, did we ever get the idea that Carrie was obsessed with library books? We've only seen her read fashion magazines!3) I love that, at the end of the movie, we truly realize how perfect Steve and Miranda are for each other. And I understand that they needed a story line for these two, but I just didn't see Steve as the cheating type. I still don't see it. Merely a plot device and not true to character. And Miranda seems even more like a *&^%^B in the movie than she did in the show. She's always been my least favorite character: she's awkward and clueless and you'd think after so many years, she'd grow a soul.4) Big and Carrie's house on 5th Avenue is stunning and it makes every girl dream that, one day, they could have it, too. The downside to this fantasy? Not even Mr. Big Bucks could afford this place. No way, no how.5) I really liked the idea of Carrie's assistant. I think it was an inspired idea and a perfect way to help Carrie find her way back. But, I don't know what everyone's big whoo-ha-ha is for Jennifer Hudson. Not impressed with her at all, and especially not in this movie. I'm not sure who I would have picked, but she wouldn't have even made my top 50.6) I left the movie feeling confused about Samantha. Over the course of 10 years, she hasn't really grown any. Sure, she dates Smith for a couple of years, but that doesn't stop her from lusting after Dante the hot neighbor boy or dumping Smith cause she's not getting enough ya-yas. I understand leaving LA because she needs her friends and she loves NYC, but left because she wanted hot sex with random guys. She's 50. Grow up!Anyway, if you're a SATC fan, this movie is a must-see. If you haven't seen SATC, watch the show first.

It fits his character and what an idiot he has been with her all these years never really giving her the place she deserves in his life. But leaving that aside, the story was well developed. Showing Carrie truly grieve, and the support and love she has from her friends. I love how Charlotte hugs her during the street scene where she confronts Big. I love how Samantha feeds her at the hotel. This is true friendship. Now the part about Stanford kissing Anthony. OMG how weird. I'm still stuck on their fighting in Season 5 when Stanford is trying to show off his boyfriend Marcus. That is hilarious so it's hard for me to imagine them being together.

1179904,A2BPDFR58H9575,B001DDBCUA,Galina,"[5, 13]","I've been a fan of the ultra-popular HBO series that had run from 1998 to 2004 and I went to see the movie that was based on the show. As a fan, I wanted to follow the stories of four women in Manhattan in search for ""the two L's: Labels and Love."" The 148 minutes long movie tried to cram the stories of four friends after we said goodbye to them four years ago but it did not exactly succeed and it lacks humor and wit of the show. The jokes in the show were often on the verge of good taste but they were not as banal and vulgar as the one that made devastated and heartbroken at some point Carrie, laugh again. Having being the fan of the show since its first season did not stop me from seeing how shallow, selfish, arrogant, and often unpleasant and not interesting the foursome of single and fabulous Manhattan women in their late 30s and 40s were. Thanks to good writing and competent directing and 30 minutes per episode, the show was always fun to watch even if it was not realistic at all, more of the fairy tale with a lot of dirty talk. I think the big part of my love for it was the fact that ""Sex and the City"" has been one of the best dressed TV shows in history. Nothing is wrong with adapting the fairy tale on Manhattan to the big screen but at 148 minutes, the movie version did not make the multiple stories interesting enough. Somewhere in the middle of the movie, I simply stopped caring for the characters and concentrated on their clothes, shoes, and bags that were fabulous as always. My interest picked up again when the film introduced a new character that was missing from the show, Carrie's personal assistant Louise from St. Louis (Jennifer Hudson). Hudson was refreshingly natural, young and effortlessly beautiful, genially sweet, intelligent and practical but sadly she did not have enough of screen time. I don't regret seeing the film - that's what devoted fans are for, and I liked the ending. For good ending, I would forgive a movie many sins. I wish Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda happy lives but I would not want another reunion. Their stories have been told.2.5/5",2,"4 Years Later or ""40 is the last age a woman can be photographed in a wedding dress without the unintended Diane Arbus subtext""",1213056000,"06 10, 2008",2008,2114,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'ultra-popular', 'HBO', 'series', 'had', 'run', '1998', '2004', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'show', 'fan', 'wanted', 'follow', 'stories', 'four', 'women', 'Manhattan', 'search', 'two', 'L', 'Labels', 'Love', '148', 'minutes', 'long', 'movie', 'tried', 'cram', 'stories', 'four', 'friends', 'said', 'goodbye', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'did', 'not', 'exactly', 'succeed', 'humor', 'wit', 'show', 'jokes', 'show', 'were', 'often', 'verge', 'good', 'taste', 'were', 'not', 'banal', 'vulgar', 'one', 'made', 'devastated', 'heartbroken', 'point', 'Carrie', 'laugh', 'again', 'Having', 'being', 'fan', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'did', 'not', 'stop', 'seeing', 'how', 'shallow', 'selfish', 'arrogant', 'often', 'unpleasant', 'not', 'interesting', 'foursome', 'single', 'fabulous', 'Manhattan', 'women', 'late', '30s', '40s', 'were', 'Thanks', 'good', 'writing', 'competent', 'directing', '30', 'minutes', 'episode', 'show', 'was', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'realistic', 'more', 'fairy', 'tale', 'lot', 'dirty', 'talk', 'think', 'big', 'part', 'love', 'was', 'fact', 'Sex', 'City', 'been', 'one', 'best', 'dressed', 'TV', 'shows', 'history', 'Nothing', 'wrong', 'adapting', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Manhattan', 'big', 'screen', '148', 'minutes', 'movie', 'version', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'multiple', 'stories', 'interesting', 'enough', 'Somewhere', 'middle', 'movie', 'simply', 'stopped', 'caring', 'characters', 'concentrated', 'clothes', 'shoes', 'bags', 'were', 'fabulous', 'always', 'interest', 'picked', 'up', 'again', 'when', 'film', 'introduced', 'new', 'character', 'was', 'missing', 'show', 'Carrie', 'personal', 'assistant', 'Louise', 'St.', 'Louis', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'Hudson', 'was', 'refreshingly', 'natural', 'young', 'effortlessly', 'beautiful', 'genially', 'sweet', 'intelligent', 'practical', 'sadly', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'seeing', 'film', 'what', 'devoted', 'fans', 'are', 'liked', 'ending', 'good', 'ending', 'would', 'forgive', 'movie', 'many', 'sins', 'wish', 'Carrie', 'Samantha', 'Charlotte', 'Miranda', 'happy', 'lives', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'reunion', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'told.2.5/5']",N/A
1179905,AY12DBB0U420B,B001DDBCUA,Gary Peterson,"[1, 1]","Last night's bargain-rack movie was the ""Sex and The City"" DVD. I always thought of the title as associated with a TV show and I had no idea there was a movie of the same name. Well, it figures. I might add that I usually wouldn't buy a movie patterned after a TV series so I had a bit of a negative attitude to overcome as I viewed it. The movie was quite good and I found it to be surprisingly sad. You'd never guess from the title and the photo on the DVD cover. Well, maybe it's a personal thing. I went through over five decades of my life as a bachelor and then married at the age of 72. We had a wonderful little son, but my wife left me for another man after a total togetherness of about seven years and I'm still not over it. ""Sex and The City"" dwells on the single life and relationship problems, with an emphasis on the latter, and it cuts close to the bone.Well, a lot of people would view the single life as party, party, party, but that's because they have no real understanding of the single life. That's the single life as depicted by Hollywood and boasted of by a lot of single people who are looking for some type of cover. My single life was occupied by wondering when, if ever, I was going to meet that special person and what might happen afterwards if I ever did. That aspect of the single life is rather sensitively covered in this movie, as are the innumerable problems that can arise when two people meld into one more-complicated life for both. The story concerned four couples, but the main emphasis was on two people, a couple who had lived together for 10 happy years and then decided to get married. The marriage approached and the arrangements got ever more complicated and the guest list topped 200 people. Believe me, you can feel the anxiety build in both of the people. Finally, when the big day arrived, the groom got to the wedding, but couldn't go through with it. The rest of the movie concerned itself with picking through the wreckage and dealing with the problems of the other couples. It's complicated and rather well done. After about the first quarter of the movie, I thought it was going to turn out a dozer, but it actually turned out to be a very good movie, albeit a somewhat painful one,Gary Peterson",5,"A Very Good Movie, But Cuts Close To The Bone.",1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,2251,"['Last', 'night', 'bargain-rack', 'movie', 'was', 'Sex', 'City', 'DVD', 'always', 'thought', 'title', 'associated', 'TV', 'show', 'had', 'idea', 'there', 'was', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'Well', 'might', 'add', 'usually', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movie', 'patterned', 'TV', 'series', 'had', 'bit', 'negative', 'attitude', 'overcome', 'viewed', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'found', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'sad', ""'d"", 'never', 'guess', 'title', 'photo', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Well', 'personal', 'thing', 'went', 'five', 'decades', 'life', 'bachelor', 'then', 'married', 'age', '72', 'had', 'wonderful', 'little', 'son', 'wife', 'left', 'man', 'total', 'togetherness', 'seven', 'years', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'Sex', 'City', 'single', 'life', 'relationship', 'problems', 'emphasis', 'latter', 'close', 'bone.Well', 'lot', 'people', 'would', 'view', 'single', 'life', 'party', 'party', 'party', 'have', 'real', 'understanding', 'single', 'life', 'single', 'life', 'depicted', 'Hollywood', 'boasted', 'lot', 'single', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'type', 'cover', 'single', 'life', 'was', 'occupied', 'wondering', 'when', 'ever', 'was', 'going', 'meet', 'special', 'person', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'afterwards', 'ever', 'did', 'aspect', 'single', 'life', 'rather', 'sensitively', 'covered', 'movie', 'are', 'innumerable', 'problems', 'can', 'arise', 'when', 'two', 'people', 'meld', 'one', 'more-complicated', 'life', 'story', 'concerned', 'four', 'couples', 'main', 'emphasis', 'was', 'two', 'people', 'couple', 'who', 'had', 'lived', 'together', '10', 'happy', 'years', 'then', 'decided', 'get', 'married', 'marriage', 'approached', 'arrangements', 'got', 'ever', 'more', 'complicated', 'guest', 'list', 'topped', '200', 'people', 'Believe', 'can', 'feel', 'anxiety', 'build', 'people', 'Finally', 'when', 'big', 'day', 'arrived', 'groom', 'got', 'wedding', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'rest', 'movie', 'concerned', 'picking', 'wreckage', 'dealing', 'problems', 'other', 'couples', 'complicated', 'rather', 'well', 'done', 'first', 'quarter', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'dozer', 'actually', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'painful', 'one', 'Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

And fortunately, this movie spin-off doesn't end up totally badly. What can we expect, anyway, from a big franchise such as this? Product placements all over, no less, like it's the designer names' and Vogue's field day. Three years after the series finale, somebody has got to make up for an update in today's couture via our four beloved girls. In an over-the-top-it's-almost-in-bad-taste way, that is. Honestly, during the first half of the movie, I was ready to walk out if I saw another Pucci-whatever print dress, pair of oversized hoop earrings or ankle boots. If these girls have enough money to wear labels, couldn't they have bought something appropriate yet equally fabulous for the trip to Mexico? I am very disappointed in that red dress Miranda wore... I mean, to a resort, dear? I thought the character was much more sensible than that.My version of the Jessica Zafra moral lesson is - ""make your wedding day all about the dress, and you bring it upon yourself if that's all you stand next to at the altar."" I'm not going to lecture about materialism because this movie is obviously not about moral lessons anyway, but it's just that the first half reminded me a lot about why I never liked Carrie Bradshaw in the series until she got her karma in Berger. When she took off her glasses in front of the mirror in Mexico, I wanted to say, ""Girl, you should've spent as much money on anti-ageing creams as on your Manolo Blahniks, 'cause I think Big got scared seeing a preview of the future.""And so as her karma unfolded, the movie, too, started to redeem itself, with its focus on relationships. The writers seemed to have gained the upper hand over merchandising department this time. The new character Louise was a fresh touch. I liked the parallelism in Carrie and Miranda's fight and the latter's relationship with Steve. And the tear-inducing scenes that make it the quintessential chick flick have totally overshadowed the predictable happy ending for every character (yes, including Javier and Anthony) in the movie.Predictable, yes, but it is what we came to the theater for - to see our modern day heroines remind us about the value of friendship and forgiveness and being your own self, whether you live in the city or not.",3,twas okay but i wish they made this movie for reasons other than making money out of ad placements.,1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,2472,"['moral', 'story', 'try', 'pollute', 'New', 'York', 'Public', 'Library', 'frou-frou', 'something', 'terrible', 'will', 'happen', 'Jessica', 'ZafraBad', 'good', 'are', 'fan', 'series', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'fortunately', 'movie', 'spin-off', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'totally', 'badly', 'What', 'can', 'expect', 'anyway', 'big', 'franchise', 'such', 'Product', 'placements', 'less', 'designer', 'names', 'Vogue', 'field', 'day', 'Three', 'years', 'series', 'finale', 'somebody', 'got', 'make', 'up', 'update', 'today', 'couture', 'four', 'beloved', 'girls', ""over-the-top-it's-almost-in-bad-taste"", 'way', 'Honestly', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'ready', 'walk', 'saw', 'Pucci-whatever', 'print', 'dress', 'pair', 'oversized', 'hoop', 'earrings', 'ankle', 'boots', 'girls', 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'wear', 'labels', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'bought', 'something', 'appropriate', 'yet', 'equally', 'fabulous', 'trip', 'Mexico', 'am', 'very', 'disappointed', 'red', 'dress', 'Miranda', 'wore', 'mean', 'resort', 'thought', 'character', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'sensible', 'that.My', 'version', 'Jessica', 'Zafra', 'moral', 'lesson', 'make', 'wedding', 'day', 'dress', 'bring', 'stand', 'next', 'altar', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'lecture', 'materialism', 'movie', 'obviously', 'not', 'moral', 'lessons', 'anyway', 'just', 'first', 'half', 'reminded', 'lot', 'why', 'never', 'liked', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'series', 'got', 'karma', 'Berger', 'When', 'took', 'off', 'glasses', 'front', 'mirror', 'Mexico', 'wanted', 'say', 'Girl', 'should', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'much', 'money', 'anti-ageing', 'creams', 'Manolo', 'Blahniks', 'think', 'Big', 'got', 'scared', 'seeing', 'preview', 'future', 'so', 'karma', 'unfolded', 'movie', 'too', 'started', 'redeem', 'focus', 'relationships', 'writers', 'seemed', 'have', 'gained', 'upper', 'hand', 'merchandising', 'department', 'time', 'new', 'character', 'Louise', 'was', 'fresh', 'touch', 'liked', 'parallelism', 'Carrie', 'Miranda', 'fight', 'latter', 'relationship', 'Steve', 'tear-inducing', 'scenes', 'make', 'quintessential', 'chick', 'flick', 'have', 'totally', 'overshadowed', 'predictable', 'happy', 'ending', 'character', 'yes', 'including', 'Javier', 'Anthony', 'movie.Predictable', 'yes', 'what', 'came', 'theater', 'see', 'modern', 'day', 'heroines', 'remind', 'value', 'friendship', 'forgiveness', 'being', 'own', 'self', 'live', 'city', 'not']",N/A

While the movie is almost 2 1/2 hours long, it feels like an extended episode of the show, but it moves relatively quickly with the added bonus of a massive laugh track provided by other SATC fans, in case you happen to see it in packed theatre.I loved the show during its run, but did not like the person that that Carrie wound up with as they seemed all wrong for one another for my taste. I got over it as who she wound up with was less important the fun we had together. The same applies to this movie as the girls don't disappoint, and seeing them was like having the pleasure of seeing your best buds in the old neighborhood. Sometimes going back is a mistake, but not in this case as it does not detract from the memories and allows you to have the fun of going to a boozy class reunion.I can understand how some people can hated the show as one one hand it empowered women to live their lives without looking for the approval of men or playing second fiddle to them, but at the core it could be argued without needing to dig too deeply that our girls lived in an arrested development fog with better shoes, nicer apartments, and no parents to make you come home on time. My take is that both camps are right, but I like imperfect people, esp. when they are endearing and/or make me laugh.None of the leading ladies have gotten personality transplants, and the movie celebrates their friendship, the show, the shoes, the men, NYC, designer duds, and even getting older even if not necessarily wiser. Since it's been a few years since the show ended the movie pokes fun at some of the technological changes that have taken place since in the interim and that leads to some fun. The movie integrates some nice touches that fans will love via flashbacks and characters from the show.So if you are in the mood for frothy fun and enjoyed the show, this one's for you. If you were not a fan or found it merely tolerable there is nothing here that will up your enjoyment, and you might actually wind up feeling bitter for wanting to choke a couple of the characters, especially Carrie for seemingly not having grown a single brain cell since the series wrapped. I am purposely not giving away plot developments as you should discover those for yourself.The movie would have gotten a 5 from me if the plot had not been centered around Carrie's nuptials and a secret that one of the characters keeps from the others that just drags on. Also, with the exception the Miranda's husband Steve, the straight men in their lives are merely boring acccesories, while the gay ones are way too over the top cliches. Jennifer Hudson is introduced in a one-note role and she manages to bring some sweetness to her role as Carrie's assistant. I wish that the character had been a little edgier as she the film at times feels surprinsingly old fashioned.I mention the above less than stellar points only to highlight that this is not a movie about real relationships with the opposite sex, examples of how women should be, or aimed at anyone except those who love SATC. This is all about women celebrating their lasting connections with one another, changing outfits, laughing, and being there for one another and their fans.",4,"IF you were a fan of the show,  you'll like/love  this movie.

Your significant other is going to buy this movie and you are going to watch it with her.Now the title seems promising. But this is about sex from the other perspective, hers. This means it is about relationships, and communication, and intimacy and trust. These are subjects women discuss among themselves at length and with us usually to be greeted by earnest but blank expressions. It is not something you necessarily get, but she wants you to, so you try.Here we have four fortysomething friends whose bond remains tight through one romantic disaster after another. We have their men, who like you, are clueless but ernest. We have an alpha-girl Carrie who is getting married, to Mr. Big, played hugely by Chris Noth. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is a mid-list author which in New York makes you a minor celebrity. Her friends, mostly struggle with their own relationships, excedpt for one who is happily married thus proving marriage is not an impossible institution.Well as fate would have it Carrie gets left at the altar by Mr. Big, and the rest of the movie (except for the not so surprising ending) is all about what a jerk he and men in general are.So since you are going to watch it, I recommend a few tips. First watch it in Blu-Ray  on an 1080p HDTV. The photography and scenes are gorgeous, especially in Mexico where the girls go on what would have been Carrie's honeymoon. Secondly the DVD comes with a ""digital copy.""

I'm not an S&TC; hater--far from it.  I never saw the series on HBO; I don't get cable and discovered it on DVD just as it was about to go off the air.  Being a Carrie-Come-Lately to the party actually was a huge benefit:  I got to revisit my favorite episodes on disc as often as I liked.  Like its heroine herself, ""Sex & the City"" was the most fun when it didn't take itself too seriously, and yet its best-crafted episodes are surprisingly memorable and poignant for a 30-minute 'comedy'.  At its best, S&TC; transcended mere comedy or crude sex gimmicks and mined some very deep pockets of the human soul.  Also didn't hurt that the clothes were fabulous, the cocktails were plentiful and the production design absolutely outstanding.  The series was an unabashed valentine to its fifth lady, New York City, while taking us on a journey with the four  flawed women at its center.  That journey had all the laughter, tears, breakups, makeups, pettiness, generosity, love, self-delusion and insight of which we are all capable.  That's why we went along for that ride for 6 years.  I felt that by that last shot of the girls leaving the coffee shop in the finale of Season 6, the writers had achieved the impossible: an unresolved ending that still left us hopeful and satisfied that as we said goodbye, the future for each held good things, including, most of all, their continued friendship.  That was a good ending.  There was no wedding for Carrie, but Mr. Big did say ""Carrie, you're the one"" in Paris.  Did anyone doubt what came next?I wasn't thrilled about the idea of a big-screen treatment, seeing it as redundant at best and rife with potential for disaster at worst.  I ardently hoped that writer-director Michael Patrick King and his team of screenwriters would treat the movie as four interrelated episodes of the series and craft them accordingly.  A movie event on HBO would have been more in keeping with a show that got its start there, but of course, the siren call of all those theatrical millions was too powerful to resist for everyone involved.  The movie hit some glitches on its way to production as we know, and four years went by before it made its way into theatres.  Sadly, no one has aged for the better (including Samantha).  It's not that everyone doesn't look essentially the same--they do--but the plot has not moved forward and everyone is in a holding pattern.  This makes everyone look so 2004, and not in a good way.  I'm not giving away any plot points that haven't already blanketed the known universe by saying that Carrie is planning her wedding to Big; Miranda is still doing the domesticity routine in Brooklyn with Steve and their son (didn't anyone else wonder if the poor kid is now known as 'Brady Brady'?) and Charlotte and Harry adopted their adorable little moppet from China and are now joyfully expecting their own visit from the stork.  What comes as a little bit of a surprise is that Samantha is now living in L.A. with Smith, who is now a working actor.  She jets in frequently for lunches with the girls, but one can't help but wonder whether Sam was banished to La-La Land as punishment for Kim Cattrall's foot-dragging over salary negotiations.To find Carrie and Big still dickering over his level of commitment to her after their 'le grand moment' in Paris is demoralizing; what HAVE they been doing for the last 4 years?  Did he not really mean it or what?  Given the time that elapsed, it would've been more satisfying (not to mention, merciful) if the movie opened with Carrie and Big already married, though that scenario would have deprived us of the movie's best setpiece: an extended, dreamy montage of Carrie as a bridal vision in a parade of different designer wedding gowns.  Surprises are in store for a couple of the other relationships that Season 6 had successfully locked down, we thought.Ultimately, this big-screen treatment has not really done justice to what was a small-screen story.  Big ain't necessarily better (unless, of course, we are speaking about Chris Noth--notwithstanding the fact that Aidan Shaw was my personal favorite of Carrie's fiances), and in moving to the big screen, they choked.  Having achieved the perfect goodbye at the end of the series, they weren't content to leave it alone, but for Carrie & Co. and all their fans' sakes, they really should have.  All in all, watching this long-awaited movie of a great show is kind of like eating too much cotton candy; we think we need an outsized helping of such a pretty confection, only to realize that its complete lack of nutrative value has left us feeling overindulged and sick.  Frankly, the Fab Four deserved better than this, and so did we.  Do you want to buy this anyway, if you are a fan?  Probably, but it will make you want to revisit, or buy for the first time, the TV series as an antidote.",2,Kvetch and the City,1218499200,"08 12, 2008",2008,5017,"['risk', 'being', 'stoned', 'death',

1179923,A11C08FBE0Q9VI,B001DDBCUA,"It's me ""logitechgirl""","[1, 1]","The series ended perfectly!  Yet they couldn't leave well enough alone. Noooo, they had to milk this for all they could.  Not a bad business decision, but why oh why did they have to ruin what was a good thing.First of all, the best thing about Sex and the City was the bond of friendship between these women.  This completely goes out the window in the film.  Without spoiling it for those who haven't seen this - one of the girl's significant other ends up cheating on her. So of coarse the other girls feel her heartbreak and are very supportive as they were in the series with one another right?  WRONG!  The film makes a real about face from the series.  Instead of her ""friends"" supporting her decision to leave the guy, they instead end up ganging up on her and stating that she should just get over the fact that he cheated on her already & that it was a ""mistake""; that she should stop acting silly and forget about it and go back to him.  Then they go on to pretty much blaming her for the incident and calling her a moron for not putting up with being cheated on & not forgiving him for his little ""mistake"".  Accidentally dropping a jar of pasta is a mistake... putting your penis in another woman is hardly an accidental occurance.  That right there told me that this was NOT a script written by a woman.  I shudder to think about how many women in adulterous relationships actually remained in one after watching this film (because believe it or not there are women out there who look onto these characters as role-models) when three of the girls ganged up on the poor woman who's heart was broken.Also- the costuming was atrocious.  Sex and the city always had wonderful wardrobes, but here it was like they were trying too hard to make all the main characters look 'fabulous.'  The colors were often too bright. This was especially apparent on Miranda who wears colors that a partner in a NY lawfirm would never wear.  She NEVER dressed like that in the series.  In the series she dressed with style, while also dressing the way a NY lawyer like Miranda would dress.  Carrie at one time wears a HUGE top full of feathers.

And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.""I'm not sure whether the above passage is ironic considering Sarah Jessica Parker's resemblance to a horse, but there is no doubt in my mind that it is indeed prophetic and the movie version of Sex in the City is a sure sign of the approaching Apocalypse.Although I'm quite sure that this movie will be a hit with disillusioned women who wish it were based in reality, where they could buy a neverending supply of ugly dresses, ridiculously priced shoes, and everything else that one would buy to make themselves look like a Prada-sponsored hobo; it's just not realistic in any way.  It's pure fantasy.It's basically a story of four women who fool themselves in every conceivable fashion (pun intended).  When they are not embarassing themselves wearing clown outfits in public, they are attending get-togethers and parties where everyone is secretly pointing at them and calling them ""cougars"".  If all four looked like Heather Locklear, I could understand the invites these four nobodies get to high profile, in-crowd events, but the fact that three of the four (excluding Charlotte) have aged in dog years since turning thirty makes the barrage of respective social calendar invites about as realistic as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  As if it could get any more ridiculous, viewers are supposed to believe the Four Horsemen are desirable enough get a perpetual string of non-mongloid, uber-successful men, who conveniently don't have ties to former families, ex-wives, baby mommas, or children.There are so many more despicable aspects of this wretched piece of garbage that I can hardly write the review without getting into Moby Dick proportions.  Suffice to say that I was irritated by the perpetual product placement; I thought the writing was amatuer at best; the filming was more of a hindrance than an aide (TV to film translation on par with A Night at the Roxbury); and the obvious misandry that permeated throughout surely shouldn't have garnered any support for the whoresome foursome during their city-wide search for STDs.In the end, the movie paints a view of women in New York that probably belongs to the Expressionism genre.  Perhaps if they looked in the mirror and fixed the angst by engaging in a life that doesn't involve pure hedonism - while actively eliciting contempt from the audience - their lives would be a little more fulfilling.  Instead, it's the materialism of MTV's Cribs mixed with deviance of HBO's Hookers at the Point.

And from a guy's perspective, it was incredibly boring, and in a way, comedic.  I found it amusing how homely women are apparently thought to be so attractive and drop dead gorgeous.

Other reviewers have called the wedding dress a fifth character; some say New York or Manhattan itself. I say the fifth character has to be all those clothes Carrie wears, each dress costing hundreds, I'm sure. As a writer, she could afford such clothes? Wow.However, anyone with eyes must include Chris Noth's Big character. He is such a hunk! A major element that stands out for me in this movie is the respectful attitudes Carrie and Big show for each other. They are attentive, caring, and considerate (except for --well, I best not say). Anyone can make a mistake.A huge theme is forgiveness as it plays out in both Carrie's relationship and Miranda's, and in their mutual friendship. Meanwhile, Samantha learns that she is not being true to herself, an issue I just don't want to deal with. I have no idea if she is right or wrong concerning her decision.The only character without problems is Charlotte, who does seem to lead a charmed life.Overall, this is a story that reflects real life: problems in love, friendship, living arrangements, doing the right thing, and taking chances.

Now I understand why the disc I shelled out better than $20 for is so light on extras.  I was a fool not to realize that, as ever, HBO had something even bigger in the goodie bag that they were saving for later.So what do you get with this 2-disc ""special"" edition?  For starters, there's nothing ""special"" about it, unless you use the word as euphemism for that oh-so-unpolitically correct word ""retarded.""  The extra features could have easily fit onto one disc, because there are only four of them: deleted scenes, a feature on the fashion, a boring conversation with Michael Patrick King and Sarah Jessica Parker that goes in circles and a four minute ""studio session"" with singer Fergie, who did the main title song.  The only interesting thing about that dull feature is when Fergie says she ""grew up"" watching the show.  Considering she was 23 when the show started, that makes her either an idiot or a liar.  There is a feature commentary by Michael Patrick King that's worth listening to, but it's maddening that he never talks about what happened to Stanford Blatch's boyfriend, Marcus.  In Season 5 of the series, Stanford wound up with the happily ever after that all the girls were searching for, and fans of the show were elated for him.  But Marcus is inexplicably nowhere to be found in the movie, and from the way MPK and Co. carry on, it's as if he never existed.  Perhaps that mystery will be solved for the price of $50 if you buy the deluxe edition.I liked the movie a lot, which is why I avoided giving the disc a single star.  What I don't like is the fact that I once again feel as if HBO has given me the short end of the stick.  I had no idea that an ACTUAL ""special"" edition was coming out next week, or I wouldn't have bought this slap-dash edition last week.  At this point, the fact that this 2-disc extended edition comes with a digital copy that is the original theatrical version, so that you get both versions of the movie essentially for the price of one, is the only positive thing I can say about the DVD.",2,HBO has done it again.,1228435200,"12 5, 2008",2008,2211,"['was', 'prepared', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'found', 'out', 'aboutSex', 'City', 'Movie', 'Wedding', 'Collection', 'Ultimate', 'Collectors', 'Edition', 'being', 'released', 'next', 'week', 'Now', 'understand', 'why', 'disc', 'shelled', 'out', 'better', '20', 'so', 'light', 'extras', 'was', 'fool', 'not', 'realize', 'ever', 'HBO', 'had', 'something', 'even', 'bigger', 'goodie', 'bag', 'were', 'saving', 'later.So', 'what', 'do', 'get', '2-disc', 'special', 'edition', 'starters', 'nothing', 'special', 'use', 'word', 'euphemism', 'oh-so-unpolitically', 'correct', 'word', 'retarded', 'extra', 'features', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'fit', 'one', 'disc', 'are', 'only', 'four', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'feature', 'fashion', 'boring', 'conversation', 'Michael', 'Patrick', 'King', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'circles', 'four', 'minute', 'studio', 'session', 'singer', 'Fergie', 'who', 'did', 'main', 'title', 'song', 'only', 'interesting', 'thing', 'dull', 'feature', 'when', 'Fergie', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'show', 'Considering', 'was', '23', 'when', 'show', 'started', 'idiot', 'liar', 'feature', 'commentary', 'Michael', 'Patrick', 'King', 'worth', 'listening', 'maddening', 'never', 'what', 'happened', 'Stanford', 'Blatch', 'boyfriend', 'Marcus', 'Season', '5', 'series', 'Stanford', 'wound', 'up', 'happily', 'ever', 'girls', 'were', 'searching', 'fans', 'show', 'were', 'elated', 'Marcus', 'inexplicably', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'movie', 'way', 'MPK', 'Co.', 'carry', 'never', 'existed', 'Perhaps', 'mystery', 'will', 'be', 'solved', 'price', '50', 'buy', 'deluxe', 'edition.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'why', 'avoided', 'giving', 'disc', 'single', 'star', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'once', 'again', 'feel', 'HBO', 'given', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'had', 'idea', 'ACTUAL', 'special', 'edition', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'next', 'week', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bought', 'slap-dash', 'edition', 'last', 'week', 'point', 'fact', '2-disc', 'extended', 'edition', 'digital', 'copy', 'original', 'theatrical', 'version', 'get', 'versions', 'movie', 'essentially', 'price', 'one', 'only', 'positive', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'DVD']",N/A

There was plenty of drama and relationship mayhem that kept it interesting.  One of the things that I loved about the series was that the show was not just about sex/romantic relationships but also about friendship.  Female friendship to be exact and the special bond that women have and the trials they go through.  I loved that the movie also dealt with that.  Miranda and Carrie's friendship was tested and I loved the way Charlotte in her typical ""Charlotte way"" showed her loyalty and the way they all rallied around Carrie like true friends do.  I laughed, I cried, I got angry at the characters.I think this is a must for all SATC fans (some may not enjoy as I've seen on other reviews)to catch up on their lives.

1179945,A1W661TC1P6VQI,B001DDBCUA,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[6, 15]","This is a review where I have to be up-front: I've never seen HBO's hit comedy ""Sex and the City."" Not because I have anything against sitcoms that revolve around women gossiping about clothes, men, and sex, it's just that I can't afford HBO. Therefor I was actually looking forward to seeing ""Sex and the City: The Movie,"" as I hoped it would give me some clue as to why the show became such a big hit. Well, I can see the appeal, but I'm not sure if a movie was the best format for this show. Maybe a mini-series would have been better? Since I haven't seen the show I'm not sure what's been going on to lead to the events of the movie, but the movie revolves around Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), New York's ultimate single girl.Carrie is a professional writer, writing many books (mostly about relationships and fashion), and having a long relationship with Mr. Big (Chris Noth), a relationship that I assume has been going on since the show. They are now taking the big step of moving into an apartment together, and they've found a great apartment with only one flaw: the closet is too small. No worries though, as Mr. Big promises to build Carrie a bigger closet. This decision leads to the two deciding to get married, in a manner that is very business like and unromantic. That said, it's rare that any relationship these days gets a proposal, so maybe this can still be considered a success? Well, if you've seen the previews, you know that the wedding doesn't work out, which gives the movie it's emotional pull.But this is ""Sex and the City."" This show isn't about one woman it's about four. So while Carrie's story should be enough to fill out a movie, we get major storylines for the other women as well. There's Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon), who's own marriage is in trouble after her husband cheats on her (he did this, apparently, because his wife stopped giving out). There's Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), who apparently didn't have much use for a steady relationship in the show, but now has one in a Hollywood hunk. Finally there's Charlotte Goldenblatt (Kristin Davis) who stands out as the only character to not have any relationship problems in this movie. In fact, she's pregnant in this movie, which is noteworthy because in the show she was told she couldn't have children, so it's nice to know not everyone's lives are full of gloom.Finally there is Louise, Carrie's new assistant who came to New York to find love. Carrie hires her because this girl reminds her of herself before the reality of life sank in. This is a touching storyline, but I have to wonder how much reality could have really sunk in when the woman walks around the city wearing fancy jewelry and never gets mugged? Never mind. Despite the checklist of characters one has to name off just to scratch the surface of this movie, it's to the writers credit that the movie is not more confusing. As someone who's never seen the show I was amazed at how much these stories made sense in their own right, and that the movie didn't seem to be handicapped by the TV show's established continuity.With that out of the way I need to get to why the story - for everything it does right - never quite takes off. The movie is two and a half hours long. If all this was spent wisely on the lives of the girls this might not be so bad, but the movie gives us many scenes that simply do not need to be here. These scenes include the girls talking about their sex lives, the latest in fashion, and least three five minute scene where a variety of different dresses are worn by the girls. Dialog that either advances the story or is mindless gossip is almost always spoken in a fashion store, because these women are always shopping. Always shopping. Even during some of the more emotional scenes one can't help but feel that this feels like a glorified commercial on some level.It also doesn't help that for many of these situations the women come off as unreasonable while the men come off as much clearer thinkers, which seems to defeat the purpose of a ""chick flick."" I also want to give special mention to Jennifer Hudson, who plays Louise, as this is her first role after she won an Oscar for her role in ""Dreamgirls."" I've debated Hudson's acting talent in ""Dreamgirls"" with friends, as I felt she was a better singer then an actress. At least one of my friends felt that singing was acting. Well, her performance here should validate my opinion a better, because despite playing one of the better characters in the movie, her acting and line delivery is so flat and unconvincing, that it brings into question whether she's a competent actress or not. Trust me, this is not something you want discussed about you if you won an Oscar.On the positive side I can see why this show was such a success. These characters may seem shallow, but spend enough time with them and they revel human characteristics that make them very realistic at times. The dialog is not completely dumb, the discussions with fashion obviously appeal to women, and there's something to be said about a movie where middle-aged women are portrayed as beautiful, sexy things, in a Hollywood that believes you've outlived your beauty once you reach 40. The biggest problem is the length of the film though, and how the script deviates too much for me to really recommend this. I liked some of it, and I am not opposed to a sequel, but a tighter script where the characters talk more about their lives and less about shoes would be far preferable.Rating: ** and a half

As an avid fan, I devoured every minute of it.Here are some important things to note:*The beginning was everything I could've asked for. I loved Aiden, but Big just had something just as unique as Carrie that I always loved. I always rooted for him, no matter how many times they broke up. I loved seeing Carrie happy for a change.*The marriage of Carrie Bradshaw and John James Preston (it was so weird to hear his first name over and over!) True to form, Mr. Big finds some way to break her heart. But he did it in a BIG, BIG way. I was truly angered by this. The whole time he was sitting in his car I was thinking ""you're such a coward."" It seems so unreal to me that even Big would sink to something that low; but he did, and luckily, in the end everything worked out for the both of them.*Charlotte and Harry's daughter(s). I know after the very last episode of Sex and the City, when we see Lily for the first time, everybody was dying to see what she actually looked like. And of course we all wanted Charlotte and Harry to have a baby, because frankly they are the perfect couple. I was over-joyed when she found out she was pregnant; we've been watching these girls for so long, it's almost as exciting as a family member getting pregnant. Having gone through a troubling time with my first pregnancy, I really think Charlotte did an amazing job portraying the fear of a ""high risk"" pregnancy.*Smith and Samantha. Although I didn't like that she moved to L.A. at first, and thought she would remain there, the movie took a twist and she ended up right where she belonged. Part of me is sad that they broke up because quite frankly Smith is the best thing she's ever had, but part of me was happy to see the ""old"" Samantha come back. I love her antics, the way she talks and the way she acts. And the way she ended things were beautiful but true to form. She loved him, but she loved herself more. Very empowering.*Miranda, Steve and Brady. Their roles were so very deep in this movie.. Especially with Steve's mother. And, as Sex and the City always does, they gave them a situation that many couples are faced with; infidelity. My heart did break a little when she moved out, and you could tell he was heartbroken, but the outcome did not disappoint me. And to watch Brady grow was so amazing; I am sure many were just as excited as me to see what he looked like after a few years had gone by.*Jennifer Hudson's role in this movie. She did such an amazing job as a supporting (literally) actress. She's strong, she's blunt, but she was exactly what Carrie needed at that moment in her life.*And last, but certainly not least, the four of the girls together, just like old times.

It was wonderful to be back into the lives and adventures of these 4 fabulous gals.  I loved the montage shown from the TV series, showing what these women have experienced, individually and collectively.Carrie and Big are still together and are looking for an apartment suitable for them.  However, a legal question comes up about property and rights.  When Carrie and Big get together to talk about, their conversation eventually lead them to marriage.The night before the wedding, someone says something to Big, which caused him to get cold feet on the wedding day.  Humiliated, Carrie and the girls retreat to Mexico (Carrie and Big's honeymoon destination) to recuperate.However, throughout the movie, I couldn't help but feel that Miranda and Samantha were really the focus of this film.  Miranda considers divorce from Steve as he reveals that he has had an affair.  Samantha isn't the same gal that we've grown to love from the TV series.  Samantha has now been in a relationship with Jerry for 5 years.  Meanwhile, men around her are just getting more gorgeous every day.Meanwhile, Charlotte discovers she's pregnant but is fearful because she has had a miscarriage before.  At the same time, she holds the biggest grudge against Big for the cancelled wedding.  As luck would have it, she encounters Big and ends up needing his help.When Carrie discovers that someone said something to Big before the wedding, she wonders if it's too late to save their relationship.I wish Stanley and Marco had more screen time.Anyways, *Sex and the City* is still fabulous.

Later, the four women get invited to a middle-eastern vacation in Abu Dhabi and this is where the fun begins.  Away from New York they get to examine their lives and check out another culture.  Life here is opulent, fun and, full of conversations about their problems with men, motherhood and menopause.  Of course their wardrobes are fabulous and there are good looking men all around them.  And then one of the women makes the unpardonable sin of kissing a man on a beach and she is arrested. How this all plays out is humorous and ridiculous.However I found myself caught up in the plot, giggling at all the right places, and finding myself agreeing with the women's issues which surfaced in this flick.

The first season was Ok, the second season very good and the third and fourth seasons were classics.  Fifth and sixth seasons showed wear and tear on the franchise and it was good that they stopped there. Still the show was never, ever bad.  But it is stretching it to give this movie three stars!  The story is very trivial and not true to itself.  The ""plot complications"" aren't much of anything at all.  The characters have lost their honesty and pathos and the actors seem uncomfortable and unassured.  Chris Noth and Jason Lewis have an especially hard time acting out their roles.  What happened?  I think the length of a movie and the pacing caused some trouble.  I also think that the desire to keep most things from changing brought problems too.  Even the belief that the characters had very little change for the 5 years between the movie and the show (as told by the movie) seems baseless.  Children don't seem to matter here much either.  The women leave their kids for Mexico in a way I don't think the TV characters would have ever done.  I was glad I saw the movie on DVD and not in the theaters.  I would have been outraged if I had had to sit through this in the theatres.  The show emphasized relationships and a type of reality piled on with lots of compassion.  Every show had a moral attached in some way.  The movie is about fashion, wealth and melodrama.  The incidents in the film are trivial and untrue to the characters.  Disappointing.

Let me count the ways.We're supposed to believe that Miranda can sit in a taxi outside Carrie's apartment and force her to talk to her when Carrie shuts her out, but Big never does? Big can't bring himself to just go knock on Carrie's door for almost a year??We're supposed to believe that Big even wants Carrie back after she becomes a psycho crazy bitch and beats him on the street with her bouquet? He was willing to go back. He wanted to talk. She knew from their conversation the night before that he needed to know it was just the two of them, and she was still going through with the circus wedding, and she couldn't hear him out?Of the four of them, the one you see naked having sex is Miranda?!!! That must have been as scary on the big screen as Sarah Jessica's nose and chin, which are getting more and more witch-like as she gets older and more gaunt.They gave the lovely Kristin Davis yet another diarrhea scene??!! She already did that in the TV series. Give the girl a break. And it had no real plot point except to make Carrie laugh.How did Jennifer Hudson win an Oscar when she can't act?Samantha is a sexually independent and free-spirited woman who wants to concentrate on herself, and yet she'll lay on a table covered in sushi for more than an hour waiting for Smith to come home? How is this sexually liberated? This is just profoundly stupid. Smith let her go so easily, I suspected he had enough of her, too.I don't see how any woman can identify with these women who waste so much money on foolish clothes just because they're designer brands, and too much expensive jewelry, in this economy. No good works being done here. Just selfish consumerism.Maybe a better movie would have been Big losing all his money in a stock market crash and Carrie having to support him. And how come her friends don't mind that she writes all about their private lives and makes money off it? And uses their real names in her book?And how in the world does Steve still love Miranda when she treats him so poorly, doesn't sleep with him for six months...when he had the beautiful Debbie who adored him? Steve should have just kept his mouth shut. Miranda pays so little attention to him, she wouldn't notice if he had his one-night stands in their living room.The prince charming in Sex and the City was Aidan, but Carrie truly was not good enough for him.And what was with the kiss between Mario Cantone and the guy who plays Sanford. Are they lovers now, but that whole subplot got cut? There were so many other things that could have gotten cut, like fashion week, or Carrie trying on the wedding gowns.Re: Samantha's neighbors in California -- do all the women in California have bodies mostly made of plastic and silicone?",1,Plot full of holes - warning - spoilers in this review,1222214400,"09 24, 2008",2008,2798,"['enjoyed', 'HBO', 'series', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'let-down', 'Let', 'count', 'ways.We', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'Miranda', 'can', 'sit', 'taxi', 'Carrie', 'apartment', 'force', 'talk', 'when', 'Carrie', 'out', 'Big', 'never', 'Big', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'just', 'go', 'knock', 'Carrie', 'door', 'almost', 'year', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'Big', 'even', 'Carrie', 'back', 'psycho', 'crazy', 'bitch', 'street', 'bouquet', 'was', 'willing', 'go', 'back', 'wanted', 'talk', 'knew', 'conversation', 'night', 'needed', 'know', 'was', 'just', 'two', 'was', 'still', 'going', 'circus', 'wedding', 'could', ""n't"", 'hear', 'out', 'four', 'one', 'see', 'naked', 'having', 'sex', 'Miranda', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'scary', 'big', 'screen', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'nose', 'chin', 'are', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'witch-like', 'older', 'more', 'gaunt.They', 'gave', 'lovely', 'Kristin', 'Davis', 'yet', 'diarrhea', 'scene', 'already', 'did', 'TV', 'series', 'Give', 'girl', 'break', 'had', 'real', 'plot', 'point', 'make', 'Carrie', 'laugh.How', 'did', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'win', 'Oscar', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'Samantha', 'sexually', 'independent', 'free-spirited', 'woman', 'who', 'concentrate', 'yet', ""'ll"", 'lay', 'table', 'covered', 'sushi', 'more', 'hour', 'waiting', 'Smith', 'come', 'home', 'How', 'sexually', 'liberated', 'just', 'profoundly', 'stupid', 'Smith', 'let', 'go', 'so', 'easily', 'suspected', 'had', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'woman', 'can', 'identify', 'women', 'who', 'waste', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'foolish', 'clothes', 'just', ""'re"", 'designer', 'brands', 'too', 'much', 'expensive', 'jewelry', 'economy', 'good', 'works', 'being', 'done', 'here', 'Just', 'selfish', 'consumerism.Maybe', 'better', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Big', 'losing', 'money', 'stock', 'market', 'crash', 'Carrie', 'having', 'support', 'how', 'come', 'friends', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'private', 'lives', 'money', 'real', 'names', 'book', 'how', 'world', 'Steve', 'still', 'love', 'Miranda', 'when', 'treats', 'so', 'poorly', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'six', 'months', 'when', 'had', 'beautiful', 'Debbie', 'who', 'adored', 'Steve', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'kept', 'mouth', 'shut', 'Miranda', 'so', 'little', 'attention', 'would', ""n't"", 'notice', 'had', 'one-night', 'stands', 'living', 'room.The', 'prince', 'charming', 'Sex', 'City', 'was', 'Aidan', 'Carrie', 'truly', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'him.And', 'what', 'was', 'kiss', 'Mario', 'Cantone', 'guy', 'who', 'Sanford', 'Are', 'lovers', 'now', 'whole', 'subplot', 'got', 'cut', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'cut', 'fashion', 'week', 'Carrie', 'trying', 'wedding', 'gowns.Re', 'Samantha', 'neighbors', 'California', 'do', 'women', 'California', 'have', 'bodies', 'mostly', 'made', 'plastic', 'silicone']",N/A

(And I'm someone who left my knowledge of fashion trends and designers in my senior year college dorm- the day I graduated!)Carrie is still Carrie, selfish and immature as ever. She can't seem to ""hear"" Mr. Big (John) over her own ego. She wants a big wedding, he wants something small and plain. Of course, they clash, argue, and then make-up. A happy ending for them.Miranda is still cynical. She is feeling the pressure of her full-time job and motherhood. She lost her desire for Steve. Steve has a one-night stand. Now what? Will they be ""happily ever after""? Will Miranda learn to work on herself? She doesn't have her shrink like she did in the TV show. What will she do?Charlotte is living the most normal life of the 4. She is raising her adopted daughter. She gets pregnant. Yay! The only bad thing that happens to her is a case of Montezuma's Revenge. Even then, she recooperates quickly.Samantha, now living in LA, has also changed. She is a stay-at-home live-in girlfriend to Smith. They are still together after four years. Samantha has enough free time to visit her friends in NYC. But how does she really feel about her new role? We finally see how miserable she really is when she makes a surprise visit to Charlotte's baby shower.  Her character's closure is the saddest. But at least we now know that Smanatha is working on her issues, instead of covering them up with lots of sex.Of course, the movie is all about product placement. There is mention of Manolos, Vogue magazine, etc. The four women are still going out on the town, decked to the 9s. There is the fashion show. that stuff doesn't really interest me anymore. Minus 1 star.Also, there is too much ""soft-core"" sex in this movie. Samantha's well-libido-ed neighbor gives more of a show than I wanted. (Wouldn't some sexy sounds convey the same message as a soft-core sex scene???) The make-up sex between one of the 4 main characters and her guy is also way too much for me to see. Maybe some passionate kissing instead??? I'd get the message that way- it's make up sex!!!! Minus 1 star.Ladies, rent this movie for fun. It's a nice wrap-up to the series.

The film starts out with Samantha bidding $50,000 on a ring she wants just ""cause it's cute"".  Then Big jilts Carrie AGAIN at the alter- something he's already done during the episodes, and she has to act surprised and/or depressed.  They go to Mexico where Charlotte craps her pants during a Larry, Moe and Curly like scene that I assume was supposed to be funny??  It's not.

1179968,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B001DDBCUA,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[6, 8]","I have been a fan of HBO's Sex and the City since it's premiere in 1998, when I was a little nerdito sneaking into my parent's basement, trying to catch a glimpse of Kim Catrall's bare breasts. As a little nergin in Los Angeles who only knew the pleasure of my own hand, I was amazed at the glittering word of frantic New Yorkers having sex, and quickly became addicted. My mom thought the show was the ""work of the devil,"" so I had to sneak a peak every chance I got, but it was enough for me to know that I was watching the BEST SHOW EVER!Since the show's premiere, Carrie Bradshaw and Co. taught a generation of women how to dress, be confident with themselves, and act as slutty as possible, so when the rumored movie finally took shape, I couldn't be more excited! I missed Carrie and the girls dearly since they left the air in 2004. Kim Catrall's breasts were edited out of the KTLA and TBS reruns, so the only image I had of them were my faded memories from the show's heyday. There was so much secrecy with the movie's plot, and Sarah Jessica Parker went on record saying that the trailer was edited to deceive, so I didn't know what to expect. La Coacha and I were so excited to see this, we had our tickets weeks in advance and planned to make an evening of it with our friends. So after dinner, we all headed to the theater, squealing and screaming with delight. I felt like a giddy school girl, drunk with anticipation. So was the movie worth the hype? Did it measure up to the brilliance of Mean Girls and Clueless? The answer is....YES! This movie was everything I expected, and more! The ladies have grown up, matured, and found their rightful place in life. But, as we all know, life is not always happily ever after, and this movie explores that to the fullest. And while it's exactly as the trailer made it out to be, it was still a wonderful ride getting to that final moment. And two and a half hours later, I wish it were longer.So what happened since the show ended? If you haven't seen the movie and want to be surprised, skip ahead NOW.Carrie is still in a relationship with Big, and he finally proposes, but leaves her at the altar. Charlotte has moved on from being a closeted ho (c'mon, she would pretend to be all innocent but slept with almost as many men as Samantha), and is still married to fugly beast Harry (boy is he ever!) and is mom to a cute little third world child. Miranda is married to Steve, living in Brooklyn, and not having sex, while Samantha is hornier than ever because her boyfriend Smith works all the time (sadly, while there is plenty of sex, Kim Catrall's breasts never cameo.)While a lot is crammed into two and a half hours, and the men play second fiddle to the ladies, this movie really is a valentine to the millions of loyal Sex and the City fans out there. I didn't quite know what to expect, and while the film has the predictability of many past romantic movies, this is still more intelligently written and better acted than most romantic comedies out there - Charlotte's `mean' look and one-liner to Big, and Samantha's 'sushi surprise' for Smith are utterly priceless, as is the little `accident' Charlotte has in Mexico. I did miss Standford's boyfriend Marcus (not cause I'm gay or anything), and I wish Smith and Harry had some more to do in the film, but I was glad to have them there just the same. The characters get their happily ever after yet again (and Carrie finally aquires her dream closet), and I almost died in movie bliss. I really hope the much talked about sequel gets made.So overall, I give this movie two dicks up and recommend that all fans and non-fans alike, see it immediately. This straight guy loved it and plans to see it again very soon.[...]",5,Sex and the City Movie is Worth the Hype!,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,3738,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'HBO', 'Sex', 'City', 'premiere', '1998', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'nerdito', 'sneaking', 'parent', 'basement', 'trying', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'Kim', 'Catrall', 'bare', 'breasts', 'little', 'nergin', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'who', 'only', 'knew', 'pleasure', 'own', 'hand', 'was', 'amazed', 'glittering', 'word', 'frantic', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'having', 'sex', 'quickly', 'became', 'addicted', 'mom', 'thought', 'show', 'was', 'work', 'devil', 'had', 'sneak', 'peak', 'chance', 'got', 'was', 'enough', 'know', 'was', 'watching', 'BEST', 'SHOW', 'EVER', 'show', 'premiere', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'Co.', 'taught', 'generation', 'women', 'how', 'dress', 'be', 'confident', 'act', 'as', 'slutty', 'possible', 'so', 'when', 'rumored', 'movie', 'finally', 'took', 'shape', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'excited', 'missed', 'Carrie', 'girls', 'dearly', 'left', 'air', '2004', 'Kim', 'Catrall', 'breasts', 'were', 'edited', 'KTLA', 'TBS', 'reruns', 'only', 'image', 'had', 'were', 'faded', 'memories', 'show', 'heyday', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'secrecy', 'movie', 'plot', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'went', 'record', 'saying', 'trailer', 'was', 'edited', 'deceive', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'La', 'Coacha', 'were', 'so', 'excited', 'see', 'had', 'tickets', 'weeks', 'advance', 'planned', 'make', 'evening', 'friends', 'So', 'dinner', 'headed', 'theater', 'squealing', 'screaming', 'delight', 'felt', 'giddy', 'school', 'girl', 'drunk', 'anticipation', 'was', 'movie', 'hype', 'measure', 'up', 'brilliance', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'Clueless', 'answer', '.YES', 'movie', 'was', 'everything', 'expected', 'more', 'ladies', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'matured', 'found', 'rightful', 'place', 'life', 'know', 'life', 'not', 'always', 'happily', 'ever', 'movie', 'fullest', 'exactly', 'trailer', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'was', 'still', 'wonderful', 'ride', 'getting', 'final', 'moment', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'later', 'wish', 'were', 'longer.So', 'what', 'happened', 'show', 'ended', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'want', 'be', 'surprised', 'skip', 'ahead', 'NOW.Carrie', 'still', 'relationship', 'Big', 'finally', 'altar', 'Charlotte', 'moved', 'being', 'closeted', 'ho', ""c'mon"", 'would', 'pretend', 'be', 'innocent', 'slept', 'almost', 'many', 'men', 'Samantha', 'still', 'married', 'fugly', 'beast', 'Harry', 'boy', 'ever', 'mom', 'cute', 'little', 'third', 'world', 'child', 'Miranda', 'married', 'Steve', 'living', 'Brooklyn', 'not', 'having', 'sex', 'Samantha', 'hornier', 'ever', 'boyfriend', 'Smith', 'time', 'sadly', 'plenty', 'sex', 'Kim', 'Catrall', 'breasts', 'never', 'cameo', 'lot', 'crammed', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'men', 'play', 'second', 'fiddle', 'ladies', 'movie', 'really', 'valentine', 'millions', 'loyal', 'Sex', 'City', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'film', 'predictability', 'many', 'past', 'romantic', 'movies', 'still', 'more', 'intelligently', 'written', 'better', 'acted', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'there', 'Charlotte', 'mean', 'look', 'one-liner', 'Big', 'Samantha', ""'sushi"", 'surprise', 'Smith', 'are', 'utterly', 'priceless', 'little', 'accident', 'Charlotte', 'Mexico', 'did', 'miss', 'Standford', 'boyfriend', 'Marcus', 'not', 'cause', ""'m"", 'gay', 'anything', 'wish', 'Smith', 'Harry', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'film', 'was', 'glad', 'have', 'there', 'just', 'same', 'characters', 'get', 'happily', 'ever', 'yet', 'again', 'Carrie', 'finally', 'dream', 'closet', 'almost', 'died', 'movie', 'bliss', 'really', 'hope', 'much', 'talked', 'sequel', 'made.So', 'overall', 'give', 'movie', 'two', 'recommend', 'fans', 'non-fans', 'alike', 'see', 'immediately', 'straight', 'guy', 'loved', 'see', 'again', 'very', 'soon.', '[', ']']",N/A

In the interim at least we have the series on DVD and the movie to keep us entertained. I'd skip the second film, and go with this one instead.

The movie did not top the series, but it was still a lot of fun to watch.I'm not going to give a play-by-play of the film because I don't want to spoil the plot for everyone. Obviously, the movie picks up several years after the TV series left off. I understand why some critics are having a field day with this film. Yes, there are a few hokey moments in the movie, and there are some issues with the plot. Personally, even I got a bit irritated with Carrie during the movie. Exactly how much crap from Mr. Big is she willing to put up with in her lifetime?! However, all that aside, I am not writing this review from the point of view of a critic. I'm writing it as a die-hard ""Sex and the City"" fan. And the bottom line is, it was so great to see Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte together again that I'm willing to forgive all the little things that were wrong with the film.

1179979,A2R9J5LULVKF6T,B001DDBCUA,Michael T. Rognlien,"[4, 6]","I should preface my comments - the HBO series is still one of my favorite of all time.  Not because it was consistently the best thing on Sunday nights when it originally aired, but because it was unafraid of pushing people's limits about what was attractive, what was socially acceptable and what was 'ok' for women to think, say and feel.I thought that the series ending was one of the best and most well-written show closures of all time so I was a little unsure of where the movie would actually go that was 'better' than the show's ending.  After seeing it (something many of you should consider doing before writing a review of it - if you want to trash the show, go review one of the DVD sets) I was nervous unnecessarily.  I think creating it was another way of pushing us out of our comfort zones.  ""You had such a great series, why risk ruining that?""I thought that the movie was everything the show was - a realistic mix of emotional, superficial, silly, heartbreaking and, ultimately, fulfilling.  I spent many Sunday nights over 6 years of my life getting to know the characters and the movie, like the show, showed that regardless of the passage of time or the life experiences the characters would have had in 4 years, they, like us, didn't change much.  Their flaws are still there, though they all appear to have gotten better at managing them.  The friendships are still there, and the actors' affection for their characters was readily apparent as they slipped back into them with ease.Life doesn't have perfect endings, and it DOES go on, so I'm glad that the movie was made.  It is clear that they DID make the movie for the fans of the show, so if you weren't one, don't go see the movie.  But for those of us who enjoyed (through our frustration, disdain and ultimately acceptance of) watching these four women and their sincere and enduring friendships grow over time, save the mysoginistic insults about their looks (likely coming from non-JoliePitt's themselves) and their choices in life and let those of us who found the series - AND the movie - so much fun just enjoy the 2+ hours we get to spend reunited with them all.PS - if you're going to say that Sarah Jessica Parker looks like a 'foot' - at least have the character to give credit to Family Guy for the quote.",4,A great reunion for the cast and the fans,1212278400,"06 1, 2008",2008,2296,"['should', 'preface', 'comments', 'HBO', 'series', 'still', 'one', 'favorite', 'time', 'Not', 'was', 'consistently', 'best', 'thing', 'Sunday', 'nights', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'was', 'unafraid', 'pushing', 'people', 'limits', 'what', 'was', 'attractive', 'what', 'was', 'socially', 'acceptable', 'what', 'was', 'women', 'think', 'say', 'feel.I', 'thought', 'series', 'ending', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'well-written', 'show', 'closures', 'time', 'was', 'little', 'unsure', 'where', 'movie', 'would', 'actually', 'go', 'was', ""'better"", 'show', 'ending', 'seeing', 'something', 'many', 'should', 'consider', 'doing', 'writing', 'review', 'want', 'trash', 'show', 'go', 'review', 'one', 'DVD', 'sets', 'was', 'nervous', 'unnecessarily', 'think', 'creating', 'was', 'way', 'pushing', 'comfort', 'zones', 'had', 'such', 'great', 'series', 'why', 'risk', 'ruining', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'everything', 'show', 'was', 'realistic', 'mix', 'emotional', 'superficial', 'silly', 'heartbreaking', 'ultimately', 'fulfilling', 'spent', 'many', 'Sunday', 'nights', '6', 'years', 'life', 'getting', 'know', 'characters', 'movie', 'show', 'showed', 'regardless', 'passage', 'time', 'life', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'had', '4', 'years', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'much', 'flaws', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'appear', 'have', 'gotten', 'better', 'managing', 'friendships', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'actors', 'affection', 'characters', 'was', 'readily', 'apparent', 'slipped', 'back', 'ease.Life', ""n't"", 'have', 'perfect', 'endings', 'DOES', 'go', ""'m"", 'glad', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'clear', 'DID', 'make', 'movie', 'fans', 'show', 'so', 'were', ""n't"", 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'frustration', 'disdain', 'ultimately', 'acceptance', 'watching', 'four', 'women', 'sincere', 'enduring', 'friendships', 'grow', 'time', 'save', 'mysoginistic', 'insults', 'looks', 'likely', 'coming', 'non-JoliePitt', 'choices', 'life', 'let', 'who', 'found', 'series', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'just', 'enjoy', '2+', 'hours', 'get', 'spend', 'reunited', 'all.PS', ""'re"", 'going', 'say', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', ""'foot"", 'least', 'have', 'character', 'give', 'credit', 'Family', 'Guy', 'quote']",N/A

(I don't get out much). I think it was impossible to live up to all the hype associated with the opening. Having forgotten about it, I received the DVD as a gift and was reluctant to watch it again. But I'm certainly glad I did. With lowered expectations, I found this to be an enjoyable visit with the glamorous New York characters, Carrie Bradshaw, Samantha Jones, Miranda Hobbs and Charlotte York Goldenblatt.Make no mistake, above all else this is a fashion show. (A bright blue Manolo Blahaik with a five-inch heel is even used in place of a diamond ring).  When the show was still on television I used to say my favorite part about it was the writing with fashion a close second. For the film it was the other way around. Because the characters are so well known their behaviors and lines at times come off as clich&eacute; . . . but there is the occasional surprise with some laugh-out-loud lines and some highly emotional moments. True fans of the show will definitely feel it's worth the watch.What I liked best about this film is the focus on RELATIONSHIPS (on several levels) and how they evolve. I believe the whole concept of the Sex and the City industry is that even the most fanciful characters face real-life problems . . . it's just that they look really gooooooood while they do.Michele Cozzens is the author of It's Not Your Mother's Bridge Club.",4,Much Better The Second Time Around,1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,1486,"['was', 'only', 'film', 'saw', 'summer', 'big', 'screen', 'perhaps', 'why', 'found', 'initial', 'disappointment', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'out', 'much', 'think', 'was', 'impossible', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'associated', 'opening', 'Having', 'forgotten', 'received', 'DVD', 'gift', 'was', 'reluctant', 'watch', 'again', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'glad', 'did', 'lowered', 'expectations', 'found', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'visit', 'glamorous', 'New', 'York', 'characters', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'Samantha', 'Jones', 'Miranda', 'Hobbs', 'Charlotte', 'York', 'Goldenblatt.Make', 'mistake', 'else', 'fashion', 'show', 'bright', 'blue', 'Manolo', 'Blahaik', 'five-inch', 'heel', 'even', 'used', 'place', 'diamond', 'ring', 'When', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'television', 'used', 'say', 'favorite', 'part', 'was', 'writing', 'fashion', 'close', 'second', 'film', 'was', 'other', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'behaviors', 'lines', 'times', 'come', 'off', 'clich', 'eacute', 'occasional', 'surprise', 'laugh-out-loud', 'lines', 'highly', 'emotional', 'moments', 'True', 'fans', 'show', 'will', 'definitely', 'feel', 'watch.What', 'liked', 'best', 'film', 'focus', 'RELATIONSHIPS', 'several', 'levels', 'how', 'evolve', 'believe', 'whole', 'concept', 'Sex', 'City', 'industry', 'even', 'most', 'fanciful', 'characters', 'face', 'real-life', 'problems', 'just', 'look', 'really', 'gooooooood', 'do.Michele', 'Cozzens', 'author', 'Not', 'Mother', 'Bridge', 'Club']",N/A

I was so wrong.  They really did an outstanding job.  I loved the fact that Mr. Big became more of a real person in the movie, something I always found lacking in the series (especially since I was definitely in the Big camp versus the Aidan camp.)  I smiled a LOT at the dialog and felt my heart almost literally break at one point (which I won't spoil.)

Disc Three also adds a feature on the DVD release party and the day Sarah Jessica Parker did the scene with all the wedding gown changes.Disc Four is a music disc that is worth it for me because of two additions.

While this movie might be ""long-awaited"" it is also too late for any good to come of it. The film itself was virtually a paid advertisement and is also was a complete mess, ruined by the simple fact that the story was over before it began.The film begins with a reiteration of the TV shows ""funny"" highlights to get people emotionally engaged into the world of Carrie and her friends again. Once the story gets going we soon realize that Carrie and Big have not tied the knot. So now we know the major plot of the movie. Because of this we know one of them will have some sort of commitment issue and post pone the wedding. Big surprise.Along with this, all of the girls have their own trite issues all at the same time over stupid stuff. I have resolved, at this point, that these girls are certifiably insane. None of them deserve the relationships they have, nor do they know how relationships work. They react way off the handle over a single and incidental flaw or behavior from their guys, and they shun them for months on end! These girls are some of the most irrational beings portrayed on television.This movie is only a testament to their insanity. To further this problem, the studio decided to release an Extended Version which closes nearly on the 3-hour mark! Watching this movie, I was thinking to myself, ""When will this movie end?!?"" It just goes on and on with no funny moments whatsoever. I feel like all of the humor is dated because the show has been off the air for like 5 years now. Although the girls have good chemistry, its really not enough to make this a likable movie. Its a waste of time on their part, the film crews part, and an insult to the audience to feel that we need this movie in our lives. The fact that a 150-minute version exists is testimony to how much bad footage exists and that they had no idea of where the movie was headed from the beginning.

But in that, the movie (and the series) failed pretty miserably...I REALLY LIKE THESE STORIES.I find Carrie and her friends to be mostly annoying, self-centered people...folks I would probably greatly dislike if I met them in ""real life.""  Carrie, in particular, is annoying because she thinks she's deep and looking for love and happiness with a man...when in reality, possessions are what makes her happy.  Samantha, at least, is open about her shallowness (it's her need for love that she squelches).  Miranda is capable of warmth, love and openness...but she's also very controlling by nature, and this often runs her afoul of the people she most wants in her life.  Charlotte is cheery and optimistic, and essentially a very good person...she is truly capable of happiness.(Folks, if you're reading this, and aren't familiar with these characters...I'm sorry.  But to be honest, the movie SEX AND THE CITY is not for you.  You MUST be familiar with these characters (and the men in their lives) to enjoy it or even FOLLOW it.  So I'm writing under the assumption that you ARE familiar with the roles portrayed by Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon and Kristen Davis.)So WHY do I like these stories?  Well, in part because I got to swallow the entire series in a space of about 3 months.  We do not have HBO, so never saw them spread out over the years.  I rented the first DVD in the series, and my wife and I enjoyed it.  I think I liked the witty banter (no one talks that way...but I sure don't mind seeing clever people on screen), the sometimes frank talk about sex and yes, even rolling my eyes at the crazy clothes and shoes.  It always amazed me how ridiculous these women...especially Carrie...could look at times.  Also, seeing the show in one long chunk really allowed full immersion in the stories.  It was hard NOT to watch the next, and the next, and the next.So we entered the movie full of anticipation.  And we were not disappointed.  The film (rather long) is basically 5 episodes strung together...which is nearly as long as all of the pregnancy shortened Season 5!  We are picking up with the girls about 3-4 years after the show ended.  And not everything is going well.SPOILER ALERT:  If you don't want to know WHAT the girls have been up to, skip ahead.  Miranda is seemingly happily ensconced with Steve, Brady and Magda in their suburban brownstone across the river.  Yet, she and Steve have not had sex in 6 months...and a greater rift is waiting just around the corner.  Samantha is now living with Smith in California and managing his huge career.  He clearly still dotes on her...but she is also clearly pulled back to Manhattan and her hedonistic lifestyle.  Charlotte and her hubby are VERY happy raising their adopted daughter Lilly...but life has a surprise in store for them as well.  Finally, Carrie is seemingly very happy  living with Big...but they are not married.  A situation they decide to rectify.  If you've seen the trailers for the film...you might think it's all about their wedding.  You'd be wrong...but that's all I'm saying.END OF SPOILERS.  So, the film lovingly reintroduces all our favorites.  The actors all launch into their roles with relish.  They haven't missed a beat.  The drama (and antics) of the movie unspool just like in the TV show.  You could imagine that the emotional stakes of the film are raised higher than the TV show...but that isn't really the case.  Yes, big things happen to all of them...but didn't they always on the show too!  Didn't Carrie regularly go through the emotional wringer?  Same in the movie.  I will say that in the same manner in which the series ended in a very satisfactory manner...the movie aims for the same feeling.  The series ended as though it were saying goodbye forever.  The movie does the same...no major loose ends.  Yes, they could make a sequel...but they don't NEED to in order to satisfy the faithful viewer.So...all my rambling boils down to this.  If you liked the show, and would like to see more of it...and aren't expecting the big screen version to be anything more meaningful than the show...you'll be well-satisfied.  It doesn't reinvent the wheel.  It delivers.  That's a pretty good endorsement, all in all.(And if you hated the show...please stay away.  You won't be helping anyone!  And if you've never seen it, don't start with the movie.  Start with Episode 1, Season 1, like I did.  By the time you reach the end, the movie itself will be on DVD and you can polish off your experience with that!)",4,Richly satisfying for fans...for SEX novices...why bother?,1212796800,"06 7, 2008",2008,4645,"['FULL', 'DISCLOSURE', ""'m"", '40', 'something', 'year-old', 'man', 'SEX', 'THE', 'CITY', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'meant', 'movie', 'series', 'failed', 'pretty', 'miserably', 'REALLY', 'THESE', 'STORIES.I', 'find', 'Carrie', 'friends', 'be', 'mostly', 'annoying', 'self-centered', 'people', 'folks', 'would', 'probably', 'greatly', 'met', 'real', 'life', 'Carrie', 'particular', 'annoying', 'deep', 'looking', 'love', 'happiness', 'man', 'when', 'reality', 'possessions', 'are', 'what', 'happy', 'Samantha', 'least', 'open', 'shallowness', 'need', 'love', 'Miranda', 'capable', 'warmth', 'love', 'openness', 'also', 'very', 'controlling', 'nature', 'often', 'afoul', 'people', 'most', 'life', 'Charlotte', 'cheery', 'optimistic', 'essentially', 'very', 'good', 'person', 'truly', 'capable', 'happiness', 'Folks', ""'re"", 'reading', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'characters', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'be', 'honest', 'movie', 'SEX', 'THE', 'CITY', 'not', 'MUST', 'be', 'familiar', 'characters', 'men', 'lives', 'enjoy', 'even', 'FOLLOW', ""'m"", 'writing', 'assumption', 'ARE', 'familiar', 'roles', 'portrayed', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'Kristen', 'Davis', 'So', 'WHY', 'do', 'stories', 'Well', 'part', 'got', 'swallow', 'entire', 'series', 'space', '3', 'months', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'HBO', 'so', 'never', 'saw', 'spread', 'out', 'years', 'rented', 'first', 'DVD', 'series', 'wife', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'liked', 'witty', 'banter', 'one', 'way', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'clever', 'people', 'screen', 'sometimes', 'frank', 'talk', 'sex', 'yes', 'even', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'crazy', 'clothes', 'shoes', 'always', 'amazed', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'women', 'especially', 'Carrie', 'could', 'look', 'times', 'Also', 'seeing', 'show', 'one', 'long', 'chunk', 'really', 'allowed', 'full', 'immersion', 'stories', 'was', 'hard', 'NOT', 'watch', 'next', 'next', 'next.So', 'entered', 'movie', 'full', 'anticipation', 'were', 'not', 'disappointed', 'film', 'rather', 'long', 'basically', '5', 'episodes', 'strung', 'together', 'nearly', 'as', 'long', 'pregnancy', 'shortened', 'Season', '5', 'are', 'picking', 'up', 'girls', '3-4', 'years', 'show', 'ended', 'not', 'everything', 'going', 'well.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'WHAT', 'girls', 'have', 'been', 'up', 'skip', 'ahead', 'Miranda', 'seemingly', 'happily', 'ensconced', 'Steve', 'Brady', 'Magda', 'suburban', 'brownstone', 'river', 'Steve', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'sex', '6', 'months', 'greater', 'rift', 'waiting', 'just', 'corner', 'Samantha', 'now', 'living', 'Smith', 'California', 'managing', 'huge', 'career', 'clearly', 'still', 'also', 'clearly', 'pulled', 'back', 'Manhattan', 'hedonistic', 'lifestyle', 'Charlotte', 'hubby', 'are', 'VERY', 'happy', 'raising', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'Lilly', 'life', 'surprise', 'store', 'as', 'well', 'Finally', 'Carrie', 'seemingly', 'very', 'happy', 'living', 'Big', 'are', 'not', 'married', 'situation', 'decide', 'rectify', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailers', 'film', 'might', 'think', 'wedding', ""'d"", 'be', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'saying.END', 'SPOILERS', 'So', 'film', 'lovingly', 'favorites', 'actors', 'launch', 'roles', 'relish', 'have', ""n't"", 'missed', 'beat', 'drama', 'antics', 'movie', 'unspool', 'just', 'TV', 'show', 'could', 'imagine', 'emotional', 'stakes', 'film', 'are', 'raised', 'higher', 'TV', 'show', ""n't"", 'really', 'case', 'Yes', 'big', 'things', 'happen', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'show', 'too', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Carrie', 'regularly', 'go', 'emotional', 'wringer', 'Same', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'same', 'manner', 'series', 'ended', 'very', 'satisfactory', 'manner', 'movie', 'same', 'feeling', 'series', 'ended', 'were', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'forever', 'movie', 'same', 'major', 'loose', 'ends', 'Yes', 'could', 'make', 'sequel', 'do', ""n't"", 'NEED', 'order', 'satisfy', 'faithful', 'viewer.So', 'rambling', 'down', 'liked', 'show', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'more', 'are', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'big', 'screen', 'version', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'meaningful', 'show', ""'ll"", 'be', 'well-satisfied', ""n't"", 'reinvent', 'wheel', 'pretty', 'good', 'endorsement', 'hated', 'show', 'please', 'stay', 'away', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'helping', 'anyone', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'movie', 'Start', 'Episode', '1', 'Season', '1', 'did', 'time', 'reach', 'end', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'DVD', 'can', 'polish', 'off', 'experience']",N/A

1180011,A3RIFOMEH62KMV,B001DDBCUA,"Scott C. Nelson ""scotty :-)""","[3, 9]","OK tonight I tried to sit through the movie Sex and the city. It is without a doubt one of the largest pieces of garbage that Hollywood has EVER produced. And as far as female empowerment goes, June Cleaver was more independent and cutting edge than this glorified harlequin romance novel for the 21st century.I admit - I used to watch the show when it was first on. Back then, it WAS edgy. It DID make its points about separation of the sexes and their differences. By show casing four distinct classic female archetypes, it showed how these women COULD keep that classic archetype and STILL be relevant in a world that had left the 'golden age of feminine mystique' behind for a female that was based on a male image. Well, at least it did in its early incarnation.Then, the series became popular, and critiqued, and copied, and studied. And with the microscopic concentration it received, the producers felt the need to focus only on the cheap laughs and the superficiality and the vanity, and leave behind the original 'catch'. Instead of being cutting edge, this show had now become a walking and talking live animation edition of any of the mountain of superficial plastic carbon copy fashion magazines publishers are still trying to force onto women. It devolved into no more than that. It was NO LONGER groundbreaking; it was no longer MODERN or FEMINIST-ic; it had degenerated the women's movement to circa 1925. The fact that these women were 'professional' women became a subplot to their superficiality, their vanity, and the sub-textual clues that the producer/creators/SPONSORS felt women belong married and being a mother. While that ending was predetermined for the Charlotte character from episode one, to see the fiercely independent characters of Samantha and Miranda be shackled to relationships that were NOT befitting of their traits was insulting to all audience members, but most especially to women. The final seasons made a mockery of feminism and progressiveness, and instead left the bad taste of MATERIALISM, SUPERFICIALITY, and the concept of APPEARANCES over FOUNDATION.Then came the movie. While I admit again I could not watch the whole movie (well at least not sober), the one hour and five minutes I did force myself to sit through was both painful and an abomination.No, I am not a woman, nor do I confess to think like a woman or pretend to relate to women's situations. That is a task I could never come up to. But what was different between the first two seasons of the show and the later seasons/movie is that, you did not FEEL like an outsider. You felt like you were seeing INDEPENDENT women making their way through the world ON THEIR OWN. The later seasons, and MOST ESPECIALLY the movie, have taken women back almost a full century. Take away the jobs and the modern conveniences, and you have any woman from the early 1900's. And to further degenerate women is the fact that the characters 'gave in' to the status quo, just to receive acceptance (e.g. - Carrie wearing the 'fancy' dress; Carrie 'agreeing' to the LAVISH/LARGE wedding). Maybe I misunderstand the early seasons, and that the above was their intention all along. If that is the case, then I am sorry I ever watched it. The concept the movie was sending out was FIT IN, WEAR FANCY CLOTHES, SPEND LOTS OF MONEY, AND YOU WILL BE CORRECT. I always assumed one of the points of the early seasons was that women were WISE enough to see the male figure as it was and when they fell in love with the male (the FINAL fall); they fell in love with the man...AS HE WAS. In the show and the movie, it was TABOO to have a male figure suggest a female character change. But like the trash pulp 'romance"" novels of old, the female character's PURPOSE was to have the male character of its choosing either conform to the female's desires/needs/wants, or it was over. And those desires/needs/wants were ALWAYS superficial and materialistic. This movie to me is a slap in the face to feminism, intelligent viewers, and most especially WOMEN. I am offended that this movie was ever made, and apologize to any woman who felt a connection to this SUPERFICIAL, MATERIALISTIC, VAIN portrayal of the trial and tribulations of being a female.",1,a bland white wash,1251244800,"08 26, 2009",2009,4227,"['OK', 'tonight', 'tried', 'sit', 'movie', 'Sex', 'city', 'doubt', 'one', 'largest', 'pieces', 'garbage', 'Hollywood', 'EVER', 'produced', 'as', 'far', 'female', 'empowerment', 'June', 'Cleaver', 'was', 'more', 'independent', 'cutting', 'edge', 'glorified', 'harlequin', 'romance', 'novel', '21st', 'century.I', 'admit', 'used', 'watch', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'Back', 'then', 'WAS', 'edgy', 'DID', 'make', 'points', 'separation', 'sexes', 'differences', 'show', 'casing', 'four', 'distinct', 'classic', 'female', 'archetypes', 'showed', 'how', 'women', 'COULD', 'keep', 'classic', 'archetype', 'STILL', 'be', 'relevant', 'world', 'had', 'left', ""'golden"", 'age', 'feminine', 'mystique', 'behind', 'female', 'was', 'based', 'male', 'image', 'Well', 'least', 'did', 'early', 'incarnation.Then', 'series', 'became', 'popular', 'critiqued', 'copied', 'studied', 'microscopic', 'concentration', 'received', 'producers', 'felt', 'need', 'focus', 'only', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'superficiality', 'vanity', 'leave', 'original', ""'catch"", 'Instead', 'being', 'cutting', 'edge', 'show', 'had', 'now', 'become', 'walking', 'talking', 'live', 'animation', 'edition', 'mountain', 'superficial', 'plastic', 'carbon', 'copy', 'fashion', 'magazines', 'publishers', 'are', 'still', 'trying', 'force', 'women', 'devolved', 'more', 'was', 'NO', 'LONGER', 'groundbreaking', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'MODERN', 'FEMINIST-ic', 'had', 'degenerated', 'women', 'movement', 'circa', '1925', 'fact', 'women', 'were', ""'professional"", 'women', 'became', 'subplot', 'superficiality', 'vanity', 'sub-textual', 'clues', 'producer/creators/SPONSORS', 'felt', 'women', 'belong', 'married', 'being', 'mother', 'ending', 'was', 'predetermined', 'Charlotte', 'character', 'episode', 'one', 'see', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'characters', 'Samantha', 'Miranda', 'be', 'shackled', 'relationships', 'were', 'NOT', 'befitting', 'traits', 'was', 'insulting', 'audience', 'members', 'most', 'especially', 'women', 'final', 'seasons', 'made', 'mockery', 'feminism', 'progressiveness', 'instead', 'left', 'bad', 'taste', 'MATERIALISM', 'SUPERFICIALITY', 'concept', 'APPEARANCES', 'FOUNDATION.Then', 'came', 'movie', 'admit', 'again', 'could', 'not', 'watch', 'whole', 'movie', 'well', 'least', 'not', 'sober', 'one', 'hour', 'five', 'minutes', 'did', 'force', 'sit', 'was', 'painful', 'abomination.No', 'am', 'not', 'woman', 'do', 'confess', 'think', 'woman', 'pretend', 'relate', 'women', 'situations', 'task', 'could', 'never', 'come', 'up', 'what', 'was', 'different', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'show', 'later', 'seasons/movie', 'did', 'not', 'FEEL', 'outsider', 'felt', 'were', 'seeing', 'INDEPENDENT', 'women', 'making', 'way', 'world', 'ON', 'THEIR', 'OWN', 'later', 'seasons', 'MOST', 'ESPECIALLY', 'movie', 'have', 'taken', 'women', 'back', 'almost', 'full', 'century', 'Take', 'away', 'jobs', 'modern', 'conveniences', 'have', 'woman', 'early', '1900', 'further', 'degenerate', 'women', 'fact', 'characters', ""'gave"", 'status', 'quo', 'just', 'receive', 'acceptance', 'e.g', 'Carrie', 'wearing', ""'fancy"", 'dress', 'Carrie', ""'agreeing"", 'LAVISH/LARGE', 'wedding', 'Maybe', 'misunderstand', 'early', 'seasons', 'above', 'was', 'intention', 'along', 'case', 'then', 'am', 'sorry', 'ever', 'watched', 'concept', 'movie', 'was', 'sending', 'out', 'was', 'FIT', 'IN', 'WEAR', 'FANCY', 'CLOTHES', 'SPEND', 'LOTS', 'OF', 'MONEY', 'AND', 'YOU', 'WILL', 'BE', 'CORRECT', 'always', 'assumed', 'one', 'points', 'early', 'seasons', 'was', 'women', 'were', 'WISE', 'enough', 'see', 'male', 'figure', 'was', 'when', 'fell', 'love', 'male', 'FINAL', 'fall', 'fell', 'love', 'man', 'HE', 'WAS', 'show', 'movie', 'was', 'TABOO', 'have', 'male', 'figure', 'suggest', 'female', 'character', 'change', 'trash', 'pulp', ""'romance"", 'novels', 'old', 'female', 'character', 'PURPOSE', 'was', 'have', 'male', 'character', 'choosing', 'conform', 'female', 'desires/needs/wants', 'was', 'over', 'desires/needs/wants', 'were', 'ALWAYS', 'superficial', 'materialistic', 'movie', 'slap', 'face', 'feminism', 'intelligent', 'viewers', 'most', 'especially', 'WOMEN', 'am', 'offended', 'movie', 'was', 'ever', 'made', 'apologize', 'woman', 'who', 'felt', 'connection', 'SUPERFICIAL', 'MATERIALISTIC', 'VAIN', 'portrayal', 'trial', 'tribulations', 'being', 'female']",N/A

However, the overall film can proudly stand on its own merits.",4,"""Sex"" Holds Its Own on the Big Screen",1212796800,"06 7, 2008",2008,542,"['Writer-director', 'Michael', 'Patrick', 'King', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'reviving', 'popular', 'HBO', 'series', 'legitimate', 'theatrical', 'feature', 'rather', 'creating', 'extended', 'episode', 'Sex', 'City', '2008', 'perceptive', 'romantic', 'comedy-drama', 'TV-show', 'parameters', 'maintaining', 'vital', 'chemistry', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'Kristin', 'Davis', 'Judging', 'phenomenal', 'box-office', 'success', 'loyal', 'fans', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'disappointed', 'However', 'overall', 'film', 'can', 'proudly', 'stand', 'own', 'merits']",N/A
1180013,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B001DDBCUA,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[9, 10]","I'm not big on movie channels, so I was late to the scene in watching ""Sex and the City."" I'd watch ""Girlfriends,"" and I kept hearing that ""Girlfriends"" was a Black version of ""Sex and the City."" When the show started running in syndication, I watched marathon sessions to catch up, and I loved this show as much as ""Girlfriends."" It's easy to like a show and film like this when you can see yourself in the characters: Charlotte and I both have the same prudish fixation about germs and sex; I love manwatching as much as Samantha does and have similar conversations about men; I have the same career focus as Miranda; and the writing, creative, and independent streak that Carrie has. And I believe there are a lot of women out there who also feel the same way. It's like watching pieces of yourself in these characters.With this kind of connection, it was almost natural to feel their emotions. I'm not a crier, and I can count on one hand the number of movies I've cried through (Hotel Rwanda being the top one), but I was surprised that I got teary eyed during the last limo scene. I also grinned big through the sex scenes and laughed during all of the punchlines.Carrie Bradshaw (played by Sarah Jessica Parker) is now living with her long-time on and off boyfriend, Mr. Big (played by Chris Noth), and they are planning to get married, but Big admits that he has cold feet after being married twice. His concern is being with Carrie, not with getting married. Will they get married? Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon) is still hard at work as a mother and career woman, but she has lost the lust and spontaneity in her marriage, especially after six months of no sex. Will her husband hang around? Charlotte York (played by Kristin Davis) is married with an adopted Chinese daughter, and now she's playing the role of the mother until a surprise comes up. Samantha Jones (played by Kim Cattrall) is still trying to keep the relationship fun and fighting the idea of being in a serious relationship with her former playboy and now ridiculously gorgeous boyfriend Jerry ""Smith"" Jerrod (played by Jason Lewis). Throw in a wedding, a trip to Mexico, motherhood, break-ups, make-ups, therapy, weight gain, fashion, plenty of shoes, a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois, Peeping Tom(isinas), and juvenile (but still funny) humor about waxing, diarrhea, sex jokes, a peek at Dante's (played by Gilles Marini) impressive unmentionables, and naughty words from children, and there's your 2 hours and 18 minute movie.Cons: I thought Louise (played by Jennifer Hudson) character was one-dimensional, country, and all the Lou's was a little corny (name: Louise; loved: Louis Vuitton bags; from: St. Louis). Charlotte's daughter was in a bunch of scenes just taking up space. The auction scene was predictable and reminded me of an episode of ""The Cosby Show"".Miscellaneous Issues: I could not wait for the movie to be over so I could buy guacamole and chips. This movie definitely had some serious product placement with name brands, food, and fashion shows. Speaking of fashion shows, minus the first model, all of those clothes were horrible. Most of Carrie's clothes, especially that ridiculous dress with the humongous flower on it, was awful, but somehow Sarah Jessica Parker manages to look excellent in everything she puts on. Parker is one unstoppable woman.I've seen this movie twice already just to look at Dante.",5,A Little Bit Of You On the Screen,1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,3409,"[""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'movie', 'channels', 'was', 'late', 'scene', 'watching', 'Sex', 'City', ""'d"", 'watch', 'Girlfriends', 'kept', 'hearing', 'Girlfriends', 'was', 'Black', 'version', 'Sex', 'City', 'When', 'show', 'started', 'running', 'syndication', 'watched', 'marathon', 'sessions', 'catch', 'up', 'loved', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'Girlfriends', 'easy', 'like', 'show', 'film', 'when', 'can', 'see', 'characters', 'Charlotte', 'have', 'same', 'prudish', 'fixation', 'germs', 'sex', 'love', 'manwatching', 'as', 'much', 'Samantha', 'have', 'similar', 'conversations', 'men', 'have', 'same', 'career', 'focus', 'Miranda', 'writing', 'creative', 'independent', 'streak', 'Carrie', 'believe', 'are', 'lot', 'women', 'who', 'also', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'watching', 'pieces', 'characters.With', 'kind', 'connection', 'was', 'almost', 'natural', 'feel', 'emotions', ""'m"", 'not', 'crier', 'can', 'count', 'one', 'hand', 'number', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'cried', 'Hotel', 'Rwanda', 'being', 'top', 'one', 'was', 'surprised', 'got', 'teary', 'eyed', 'last', 'limo', 'scene', 'also', 'grinned', 'big', 'sex', 'scenes', 'laughed', 'punchlines.Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'played', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'now', 'living', 'long-time', 'boyfriend', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'played', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'are', 'planning', 'get', 'married', 'Big', 'cold', 'feet', 'being', 'married', 'twice', 'concern', 'being', 'Carrie', 'not', 'getting', 'married', 'Will', 'get', 'married', 'Miranda', 'Hobbes', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'still', 'hard', 'work', 'mother', 'career', 'woman', 'lost', 'lust', 'spontaneity', 'marriage', 'especially', 'six', 'months', 'sex', 'Will', 'husband', 'hang', 'Charlotte', 'York', 'played', 'Kristin', 'Davis', 'married', 'adopted', 'Chinese', 'daughter', 'now', 'playing', 'role', 'mother', 'surprise', 'up', 'Samantha', 'Jones', 'played', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'still', 'trying', 'keep', 'relationship', 'fun', 'fighting', 'idea', 'being', 'serious', 'relationship', 'former', 'playboy', 'now', 'ridiculously', 'gorgeous', 'boyfriend', 'Jerry', 'Smith', 'Jerrod', 'played', 'Jason', 'Lewis', 'Throw', 'wedding', 'trip', 'Mexico', 'motherhood', 'break-ups', 'make-ups', 'therapy', 'weight', 'gain', 'fashion', 'plenty', 'shoes', 'm', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'trois', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'isinas', 'juvenile', 'still', 'funny', 'humor', 'waxing', 'diarrhea', 'sex', 'jokes', 'peek', 'Dante', 'played', 'Gilles', 'Marini', 'impressive', 'unmentionables', 'naughty', 'words', 'children', '2', 'hours', '18', 'minute', 'movie.Cons', 'thought', 'Louise', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'character', 'was', 'one-dimensional', 'country', 'Lou', 'was', 'little', 'corny', 'name', 'Louise', 'loved', 'Louis', 'Vuitton', 'bags', 'St.', 'Louis', 'Charlotte', 'daughter', 'was', 'bunch', 'scenes', 'just', 'taking', 'up', 'space', 'auction', 'scene', 'was', 'predictable', 'reminded', 'episode', 'Cosby', 'Show', '.Miscellaneous', 'Issues', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'movie', 'be', 'so', 'could', 'buy', 'guacamole', 'chips', 'movie', 'definitely', 'had', 'serious', 'product', 'placement', 'name', 'brands', 'food', 'fashion', 'shows', 'Speaking', 'fashion', 'shows', 'first', 'model', 'clothes', 'were', 'horrible', 'Most', 'Carrie', 'clothes', 'especially', 'ridiculous', 'dress', 'humongous', 'flower', 'was', 'awful', 'somehow', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'look', 'excellent', 'everything', 'Parker', 'one', 'unstoppable', 'woman.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'already', 'just', 'look', 'Dante']",N/A

I was so upset at the way the series ended,too many loose ends and everyone else seem to grow up and get a decent ending except Carrie.I was skeptical that it would let me down by the watering down everything.But it was better than I expected ,but still mad at the way it ended.The clothes were beautiful (esp the Oscar De La Renta Wedding gown with the red rose headband and that bright blue maid of honor dress Miranda picked out)Jennifer Hudson also stars as Carrie's new friend and assistant, Louise from St Louis. She brought a lot of depth and variety to this movie with her small part.Here is a few of my favorite quotes.FAVORITE QUOTESHow often do you ""Color""? (Miranda to the girls)"" I won't tell you how often, but when Big colors he rarely stays in the lines."" (Carrie to the girls)""Color? Well I can't color enough. I would color all day...everyday if I had my way I'd use every crayon in the box.""(Samantha to the girls)""Honey even if I were in jail, I wouldn't have that....situation""PLOT (each character has their own plot)Charlotte and Harry - have an adorable adopted daughter from China (who is Carrie's little mini me)and after years of trying Charlotte is pregnant.Smith & Sam - have moved to Hollywood - Sam is an agent for the stars and Smith is a famous actor now. Samantha should be content , but the Antonio Banderas LOOKALIKE next door makes it really hard.Miranda & Steve - Miranda has changed the most- all she does is work and is so busy taking care of her son and her mother in law who has dementia ,It has taken a toll on her marriage to Steve.She is much more bitter,insensitive and depressed than she ever was and possibly bit jealous that Carrie is getting married.Carrie and Big - Carrie has written 3 successful books and is engaged to Big.She is asked by the editor of Vogue to do a wedding spread for Vogue. But Big starts to get cold feet again...Favorite momentsSamantha laying on her coffee table naked with sushi on her private parts.Charlotte's reaction to Carrie nonchalantly telling the girls of how Big proposed to herSteve and Miranda on the bridge.Bottom lineIf you were a fan of the TV series ,you will love the show.It is a great movie to see with your girlfriends.(I wouldn't advise you make your boyfriend see it,the girl next to me at the theater brought her man and he kept complaining about how miserable he was.They ended up having a fight because he kept leaving to get popcorn.)Two major quibles. Didn't like that Big has still not grown up. He has been screwing with poor Carrie's head for over 10 years and she always takes him back.Carrie deserves to be with a mature guy who makes her feel good about herself,not an self important jerk that can't make up his mind.Also Charlotte letting her little girl hear the their private conversations.

In this outing Carrie is engaged to Big; Miranda deals with Steve's infidelity with another woman; Charlotte is happily married to Harry and have adopted a baby girl; and Samantha is living on the coast with Smith, but she is having cravings for sleeping with other men.

1180032,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B001DDBCUA,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[8, 21]","Sex and the City is quite possibly the longest film ever made. Or at least it feels that way, because the creators realize that its astounding popularity amongst its fans transcends the necessity to please all audiences. It is an uber-chick-flick with only a few threads of interest for male viewers unfamiliar with the long-running HBO TV show that spawned this highly anticipated feature adaptation. But it doesn't waste its time trying to appeal in areas it wasn't designed for - it faithfully reunites the personas of the four New York women who constantly struggle with meaningful relationships, surrounded by designer clothes, fluorescent cocktails, colorful characters and occasional nudity.The plot picks up several years after the series ends, detailing how the happy endings each of the stars received managed to last for awhile before all becoming embittered. Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) whimsically narrates as she tries writing yet another book on love - this time not about obtaining it, but what to do with it once found. Her dream man Mr. Big (Chris Noth) buys the two of them a luxuriously paradisaical apartment (and builds her an unimaginably massive closet) and so the two decide it's finally time to tie the knot. But as Carrie gets overly preoccupied with fashioning an extravagant Hollywood wedding, Big begins to feel saturnine about yet another marriage.Meanwhile, the nymphomaniacal Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall) realizes she needs more sex and more attention from her Hollywood beau Jerry (Jason Lewis) than he could possibly offer, and so unearths various deleterious vices to satiate her needs. Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon) struggles in her relationship with Steve after he admits to cheating on her due to her gradual disinclination with sex. Charlotte York (Kristin Davis) is the only one who doesn't seem affected by the other girls' relationship mishaps, and remains rather uneventfully unscathed within love's good graces.Frequently the film becomes an excuse to show off fashion, which is not far removed from many of the series' episodes. The difference is that the original show more nonchalantly showcased fashion while telling the characters' stories - the repetitious montages in the feature insinuate that we might miss the designer clothes if not for the lengthy Vogue wedding shoot or Carrie's apartment moving session in which she models nearly all of the outfits in her closet. Despite the main foursome's noticeable aging, most of the fashion merely reinforces the idea that if you have a nice body, everything looks good.The plentiful drinks, upscale nightclubs, exotic parties, and beautiful people are still present, but much of the film tries too hard to tack events onto a story that was already satisfactorily resolute. Unlike the show which had a beginning and end to every half-hour episode, the film only has one beginning and one end to a monstrous 148 minute marathon (approximately 5 episodes), which results in the feeling that this isn't several episodes tied together, but one excruciatingly long show.While there is plenty of comedy and risqu&eacute; humor spread throughout, the romance is realistically gritty - this is not the fantasy of Pretty Woman. Love apparently is never easy in New York (although wealth allows for expensive ways to cope with rejection), but friends go a long way to heal the pains of heartache. Perhaps that too is part of the fiction, as this inseparable group goes to dubitable lengths to aid in each other's sorrows.Sex and the City, like so many of the sequels and adaptations to hit the big screen in recent years, proves that certain ideas are destined to make money - and whether or not the continuation of these ideas are beneficial or entertaining for the fans who made them famous in the first place, the thought of making money always triumphs.- Mike Massie",2,Sex and the City Movie Review,1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,3871,"['Sex', 'City', 'quite', 'possibly', 'longest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'least', 'way', 'creators', 'realize', 'astounding', 'popularity', 'fans', 'necessity', 'please', 'audiences', 'uber-chick-flick', 'only', 'few', 'threads', 'interest', 'male', 'viewers', 'unfamiliar', 'long-running', 'HBO', 'TV', 'show', 'spawned', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'feature', 'adaptation', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'trying', 'appeal', 'areas', 'was', ""n't"", 'designed', 'faithfully', 'personas', 'four', 'New', 'York', 'women', 'who', 'constantly', 'struggle', 'meaningful', 'relationships', 'surrounded', 'designer', 'clothes', 'fluorescent', 'cocktails', 'colorful', 'characters', 'occasional', 'nudity.The', 'plot', 'up', 'several', 'years', 'series', 'detailing', 'how', 'happy', 'endings', 'stars', 'received', 'managed', 'last', 'awhile', 'becoming', 'embittered', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'whimsically', 'writing', 'yet', 'book', 'love', 'time', 'not', 'obtaining', 'what', 'do', 'once', 'found', 'dream', 'man', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'two', 'luxuriously', 'paradisaical', 'apartment', 'unimaginably', 'massive', 'closet', 'so', 'two', 'decide', 'finally', 'time', 'tie', 'knot', 'Carrie', 'overly', 'preoccupied', 'fashioning', 'extravagant', 'Hollywood', 'wedding', 'Big', 'feel', 'saturnine', 'yet', 'marriage.Meanwhile', 'nymphomaniacal', 'Samantha', 'Jones', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'more', 'sex', 'more', 'attention', 'Hollywood', 'beau', 'Jerry', 'Jason', 'Lewis', 'could', 'possibly', 'offer', 'so', 'unearths', 'various', 'deleterious', 'vices', 'satiate', 'needs', 'Miranda', 'Hobbes', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'relationship', 'Steve', 'cheating', 'due', 'gradual', 'disinclination', 'sex', 'Charlotte', 'York', 'Kristin', 'Davis', 'only', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'affected', 'other', 'girls', 'relationship', 'mishaps', 'rather', 'uneventfully', 'unscathed', 'love', 'good', 'graces.Frequently', 'film', 'excuse', 'show', 'off', 'fashion', 'not', 'far', 'removed', 'many', 'series', 'episodes', 'difference', 'original', 'show', 'more', 'nonchalantly', 'showcased', 'fashion', 'telling', 'characters', 'stories', 'repetitious', 'montages', 'feature', 'insinuate', 'might', 'miss', 'designer', 'clothes', 'not', 'lengthy', 'Vogue', 'wedding', 'shoot', 'Carrie', 'apartment', 'moving', 'session', 'models', 'nearly', 'outfits', 'closet', 'main', 'foursome', 'noticeable', 'aging', 'most', 'fashion', 'merely', 'idea', 'have', 'nice', 'body', 'everything', 'good.The', 'plentiful', 'drinks', 'upscale', 'nightclubs', 'exotic', 'parties', 'beautiful', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'present', 'much', 'film', 'tries', 'too', 'hard', 'tack', 'events', 'story', 'was', 'already', 'satisfactorily', 'resolute', 'show', 'had', 'beginning', 'end', 'half-hour', 'episode', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'beginning', 'one', 'end', 'monstrous', '148', 'minute', 'marathon', 'approximately', '5', 'episodes', 'results', 'feeling', ""n't"", 'several', 'episodes', 'tied', 'together', 'one', 'excruciatingly', 'long', 'show.While', 'plenty', 'comedy', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'humor', 'spread', 'romance', 'realistically', 'gritty', 'not', 'fantasy', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Love', 'apparently', 'never', 'easy', 'New', 'York', 'wealth', 'allows', 'expensive', 'ways', 'cope', 'rejection', 'friends', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'heal', 'pains', 'heartache', 'Perhaps', 'too', 'part', 'fiction', 'inseparable', 'group', 'dubitable', 'lengths', 'aid', 'other', 'sorrows.Sex', 'City', 'so', 'many', 'sequels', 'adaptations', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', 'recent', 'years', 'certain', 'ideas', 'are', 'destined', 'make', 'money', 'not', 'continuation', 'ideas', 'are', 'beneficial', 'entertaining', 'fans', 'who', 'made', 'famous', 'first', 'place', 'thought', 'making', 'money', 'always', 'triumphs.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A
1180033,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B001DDBCUA,Theo,"[1, 1]","They say brevity is the soul of wit. Unfortunately this is one of those films that reminds us of that. It also sharpens our appreciation for just how much of the TV show's appeal came from its deft, rapier-like precision. From really tightly written dialogue and spot-on editing.Of course, whenever a half-hour show gets extrapolated into a full length movie, the central issue the creators must struggle with is almost always the same: what works very well in half an hour minus commercial breaks rarely works out so well in a full length movie. The writers must choose between sticking with the tried and tested formula, and so almost inevitably producing mediocrity, or alternatively, taking some very real creative risks with the way they approach and structure the entire piece.In this case...Let's just say they chose not to take those risks.When watching this movie there were times where I really felt as if I were watching a scene from the TV series played out in slow motion. In a typical episode the TV show communicated more in one minute than the film would in ten. There were other times when the film simply dragged, even to the point where it was just plain boring. To be fair, it wasn't all like this. There were times in the film, mainly around the middle, where I genuinely got caught up in the characters, the world they inhabited, and what they were doing. It's just that there were also plenty of times when I didn't. Given that this film came in at over two and a quarter hours, I can't help but feel that it would've benefited from some more proactive editing. It's almost as if, having lived so long under the tyranny of the 22 minute half hour, the writers and editors never developed the ability to impose discipline from within.On the plus side, this film is beautiful simply to look at. And it's impossible for me to say a single bad word about the actors. Or for that matter about the ""behind the scenes"" people who did the props, the sets, and the photography. Everything is immaculately put together. To be perfectly clear, this is not a bad movie. If you look at it simply as something to kill an afternoon while you knock back a few beers (or dare I say, cosmopolitans) then by all means go for it. You're in for an entertaining afternoon. Perhaps the mistake I made was omitting the alcohol. Just be aware that if you go in hoping for something with the wit and depth of the TV series, you are going to be disappointed.Oh, and I personally found the ending a little trite.Not that I'm giving away any spoilers!Theo.",3,A Disappointment,1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,2550,"['say', 'brevity', 'soul', 'wit', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'films', 'also', 'appreciation', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'TV', 'show', 'appeal', 'came', 'deft', 'rapier-like', 'precision', 'really', 'tightly', 'written', 'dialogue', 'spot-on', 'editing.Of', 'course', 'whenever', 'half-hour', 'show', 'extrapolated', 'full', 'length', 'movie', 'central', 'issue', 'creators', 'must', 'struggle', 'almost', 'always', 'same', 'what', 'very', 'well', 'hour', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'rarely', 'out', 'so', 'well', 'full', 'length', 'movie', 'writers', 'must', 'choose', 'sticking', 'tried', 'tested', 'formula', 'so', 'almost', 'inevitably', 'producing', 'mediocrity', 'alternatively', 'taking', 'very', 'real', 'creative', 'risks', 'way', 'approach', 'structure', 'entire', 'piece.In', 'case', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'chose', 'not', 'take', 'risks.When', 'watching', 'movie', 'were', 'times', 'where', 'really', 'felt', 'were', 'watching', 'scene', 'TV', 'series', 'played', 'out', 'slow', 'motion', 'typical', 'episode', 'TV', 'show', 'communicated', 'more', 'one', 'minute', 'film', 'would', 'ten', 'were', 'other', 'times', 'when', 'film', 'simply', 'dragged', 'even', 'point', 'where', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'be', 'fair', 'was', ""n't"", 'were', 'times', 'film', 'mainly', 'middle', 'where', 'genuinely', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'characters', 'world', 'inhabited', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'just', 'were', 'also', 'plenty', 'times', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'Given', 'film', 'came', 'two', 'quarter', 'hours', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'would', ""'ve"", 'benefited', 'more', 'proactive', 'editing', 'almost', 'having', 'lived', 'so', 'long', 'tyranny', '22', 'minute', 'half', 'hour', 'writers', 'editors', 'never', 'developed', 'ability', 'impose', 'discipline', 'within.On', 'plus', 'side', 'film', 'beautiful', 'simply', 'look', 'impossible', 'say', 'single', 'bad', 'word', 'actors', 'matter', 'scenes', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'props', 'sets', 'photography', 'Everything', 'immaculately', 'put', 'together', 'be', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'look', 'simply', 'something', 'kill', 'afternoon', 'knock', 'back', 'few', 'beers', 'dare', 'say', 'cosmopolitans', 'then', 'means', 'go', ""'re"", 'entertaining', 'afternoon', 'Perhaps', 'mistake', 'made', 'was', 'omitting', 'alcohol', 'Just', 'be', 'aware', 'go', 'hoping', 'something', 'wit', 'depth', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed.Oh', 'personally', 'found', 'ending', 'little', 'trite.Not', ""'m"", 'giving', 'away', 'spoilers', 'Theo']",N/A

However, does it work?One of the major differences between a weekly TV show and a movie is that on TV you allow your characters to grow gradually while exploring different things in their lives. However, in a movie, you don't have that kind of privilege. You only have around 3 hrs to tell everything. So to deal with this issue, Sex and the City put the fabulous four into a whole year of adventure in 2.5 hours. Does it work? Well it keeps the funny stuff and sometimes candid stuff on the show but on the whole you feel like watching a montage of events for the characters without actually being able to think that they are unfolding in a meaningful manner. Those are life changing events, but when they are being broken down into numerous pieces that weave a plot together in 2.5 hours, it lacks the tension it allows on the TV show. This, without doubt, taxed the performance of the leads - SJP, Kim Catrall, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon. When you watch them, you feel like they are busily putting things together to make their characters work once again. They are all familiar characters but the development was so fast tracked that you wonder how the thought process became so fast food like as compared to a meaningful growth in the TV show.?Fashion is the big thing in the TV show, so we have lots of fashion in the movie, including the iconic dress we saw in the opening credits for every show during the 6 years run of the show. However, the attempt of jam packing so many wardrobe changes in the show failed to let the fashion to speak for themselves. It is just a consortium of beautiful fashion popping up in display windows as you stroll down the 5th Avenue. In the TV show, the fashion forms part of the story telling with the characters e.g. the change of wardrobe from high power neutral sex suits for Miranda to motherly and feminine clothes later during the six year run. But in the movie, fashions are just accessories to provide another talking point for the movie.For the men in the movie, except for Chris Noth's Mr. Big, all other boyfriends and husbands have become just a requirement for continuity - although they never talked about why Marcus (Stanford's boyfriend) disappeared from the screen completely, and what happened to cause the bitterness between Anthony and Stanford disappeared. Is it just because of the loneliness in NY that they shared a quick patch on New Year's Eve?  It just became so vague. As for Smith Jarod, he got what he wants but we never know whether he is happy all not. The charm of dreaming to be a working actor and spending time with Samantha supporting her during chemo was completely gone.In all Sex and the City is a totem pole for the series followers to continue to worship their TV alter egos. It is still funny and outrageous in a lot of areas, but standing alone as a full fletched movie, it suffered from a high speed plot development and completely discounted the believability of the characters it once created successfully. It is still a good night out movie but that's about it. If it wants to reach the classic status as it did on the small screen, it is still a far fetched hope for Michael King, Darren Star and JSP.",3,TV formula slapped onto a movie script,1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,3380,"['doubt', 'Sex', 'City', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'TV', 'show', 'history', 'So', 'other', 'successful', 'TV', 'show', 'trying', 'translate', 'fabulousness', 'big', 'screen', 'However', 'work', 'One', 'major', 'differences', 'weekly', 'TV', 'show', 'movie', 'TV', 'allow', 'characters', 'grow', 'gradually', 'exploring', 'different', 'things', 'lives', 'However', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kind', 'privilege', 'only', 'have', 'around', '3', 'hrs', 'tell', 'everything', 'So', 'deal', 'issue', 'Sex', 'City', 'put', 'fabulous', 'four', 'whole', 'year', 'adventure', '2.5', 'hours', 'work', 'Well', 'funny', 'stuff', 'sometimes', 'candid', 'stuff', 'show', 'whole', 'feel', 'watching', 'montage', 'events', 'characters', 'actually', 'being', 'able', 'think', 'are', 'unfolding', 'meaningful', 'manner', 'are', 'life', 'changing', 'events', 'when', 'are', 'being', 'broken', 'down', 'numerous', 'pieces', 'weave', 'plot', 'together', '2.5', 'hours', 'tension', 'TV', 'show', 'doubt', 'taxed', 'performance', 'leads', 'SJP', 'Kim', 'Catrall', 'Kristin', 'Davis', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'When', 'watch', 'feel', 'are', 'busily', 'putting', 'things', 'together', 'make', 'characters', 'work', 'once', 'again', 'are', 'familiar', 'characters', 'development', 'was', 'so', 'fast', 'tracked', 'wonder', 'how', 'thought', 'process', 'became', 'so', 'fast', 'food', 'as', 'compared', 'meaningful', 'growth', 'TV', 'show', 'Fashion', 'big', 'thing', 'TV', 'show', 'have', 'lots', 'fashion', 'movie', 'including', 'iconic', 'dress', 'saw', 'opening', 'credits', 'show', '6', 'years', 'run', 'show', 'However', 'attempt', 'jam', 'packing', 'so', 'many', 'wardrobe', 'changes', 'show', 'failed', 'let', 'fashion', 'speak', 'just', 'consortium', 'beautiful', 'fashion', 'popping', 'up', 'display', 'windows', 'stroll', '5th', 'Avenue', 'TV', 'show', 'fashion', 'forms', 'part', 'story', 'telling', 'characters', 'e.g', 'change', 'wardrobe', 'high', 'power', 'neutral', 'sex', 'suits', 'Miranda', 'motherly', 'feminine', 'clothes', 'later', 'six', 'year', 'run', 'movie', 'fashions', 'are', 'just', 'accessories', 'provide', 'talking', 'point', 'movie.For', 'men', 'movie', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'other', 'boyfriends', 'husbands', 'have', 'become', 'just', 'requirement', 'continuity', 'never', 'talked', 'why', 'Marcus', 'Stanford', 'boyfriend', 'disappeared', 'screen', 'completely', 'what', 'happened', 'cause', 'bitterness', 'Anthony', 'Stanford', 'disappeared', 'just', 'loneliness', 'NY', 'shared', 'quick', 'patch', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'just', 'became', 'so', 'vague', 'Smith', 'Jarod', 'got', 'what', 'never', 'know', 'happy', 'not', 'charm', 'dreaming', 'be', 'working', 'actor', 'spending', 'time', 'Samantha', 'supporting', 'chemo', 'was', 'completely', 'gone.In', 'Sex', 'City', 'totem', 'pole', 'series', 'followers', 'continue', 'worship', 'TV', 'alter', 'egos', 'still', 'funny', 'outrageous', 'lot', 'areas', 'standing', 'alone', 'full', 'fletched', 'movie', 'suffered', 'high', 'speed', 'plot', 'development', 'completely', 'discounted', 'believability', 'characters', 'once', 'created', 'successfully', 'still', 'good', 'night', 'movie', 'reach', 'classic', 'status', 'did', 'small', 'screen', 'still', 'far', 'fetched', 'hope', 'Michael', 'King', 'Darren', 'Star', 'JSP']",N/A
1180039,A1WSFHRBY2ZD1R,B001DDBCUA,"T. Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[9, 17]","I have been a fan of the series ""Sex and the City"" since 2000, when I watched HBO's recap of the first two seasons one late night on HBO2. From that moment on, even at the age of 13 I feel in love with these characters: Miranda (the cynic), Charlotte (the old-fashioned), Samantha (the slut), and Carrie (the social anthropologist). But those one-dimension descriptions do not do the series justice at all. For 6 beautiful seasons the HBO comedy turned dramedy focused upon the life and adventures of a group of friends who see their friendship mature and blossom into a family while they try to navigate down the crazy road of love.Over a year ago when I heard news that a long-awaited feature-film was actually a possibility to say the least I was a little scared. I remember the how for the course of a year the anticipation kept building up and up for the films impending May 2008. And when cast interviews, trailers, and posters started to appear I got really excited. And then release day came and I was there at midnight with my best friend, dressed up and excited. And to say honest the movie didn't disappoint at all.While the film had some flaws at the element of being a feature film (what is to be expected from a first-time director), it wasn't the special effects or camera angles that were important. No, it was the acting and the reunion of characters that fans have been missing for the past 5 years. The story serious didn't disappoint, even with its whooping 2  hour run-time. It was the story that everyone was hoping for: One of reunions, love, the testament of commitment, the butterflies that come with everything at stake, and the beautiful experiences of love. At the level of plot the producers kept almost everything rush until after the film's release - which was a very good idea. Giving away even the minorist of plot details would destroy the films experience, and lessen the effect of the girl's reunion. All I have to say is that there are moments you'll find your jaw on the group, your eyes tearing up, and your chest aching from laughter. It truly is an adventure in those 2  hours.The film's $55 million release weekend take accompanied by the almost $400 total gross is a testament to the fans that love this show. HBO has already planned a sequel and even a third film later down the line. And while I believe those films will be amazing - they will not be able to capture the magic of this original film. It was the reunion people didn't think would happen, and it provide that beyond the dramas of life, friendship will truly survive.",5,Label's and Love,1217721600,"08 3, 2008",2008,2575,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'series', 'Sex', 'City', '2000', 'when', 'watched', 'HBO', 'recap', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'one', 'late', 'night', 'HBO2', 'moment', 'even', 'age', '13', 'feel', 'love', 'characters', 'Miranda', 'cynic', 'Charlotte', 'old-fashioned', 'Samantha', 'slut', 'Carrie', 'social', 'anthropologist', 'one-dimension', 'descriptions', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'series', 'justice', '6', 'beautiful', 'seasons', 'HBO', 'comedy', 'turned', 'dramedy', 'focused', 'life', 'adventures', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'see', 'friendship', 'mature', 'blossom', 'family', 'try', 'navigate', 'down', 'crazy', 'road', 'love.Over', 'year', 'when', 'heard', 'news', 'long-awaited', 'feature-film', 'was', 'actually', 'possibility', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'little', 'scared', 'remember', 'how', 'course', 'year', 'anticipation', 'kept', 'building', 'up', 'up', 'films', 'impending', 'May', '2008', 'when', 'cast', 'interviews', 'trailers', 'posters', 'started', 'appear', 'got', 'really', 'excited', 'then', 'release', 'day', 'came', 'was', 'there', 'midnight', 'best', 'friend', 'dressed', 'up', 'excited', 'say', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'film', 'had', 'flaws', 'element', 'being', 'feature', 'film', 'what', 'be', 'expected', 'first-time', 'director', 'was', ""n't"", 'special', 'effects', 'camera', 'angles', 'were', 'important', 'No', 'was', 'acting', 'reunion', 'characters', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'missing', 'past', '5', 'years', 'story', 'serious', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'even', 'whooping', '2', 'hour', 'run-time', 'was', 'story', 'everyone', 'was', 'hoping', 'One', 'reunions', 'love', 'testament', 'commitment', 'butterflies', 'come', 'everything', 'stake', 'beautiful', 'experiences', 'love', 'level', 'plot', 'producers', 'kept', 'almost', 'everything', 'rush', 'film', 'release', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'Giving', 'away', 'even', 'minorist', 'plot', 'details', 'would', 'destroy', 'films', 'experience', 'effect', 'girl', 'reunion', 'have', 'say', 'are', 'moments', ""'ll"", 'find', 'jaw', 'group', 'eyes', 'tearing', 'up', 'chest', 'aching', 'laughter', 'truly', 'adventure', '2', 'hours.The', 'film', '55', 'million', 'release', 'weekend', 'take', 'accompanied', 'almost', '400', 'total', 'gross', 'testament', 'fans', 'love', 'show', 'HBO', 'already', 'planned', 'sequel', 'even', 'third', 'film', 'later', 'line', 'believe', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'amazing', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'capture', 'magic', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'reunion', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'happen', 'provide', 'dramas', 'life', 'friendship', 'will', 'truly', 'survive']",N/A

That&#8217;s the problem when a series ends with each of its characters sublimely placed for the future.  You love where they ended and don&#8217;t want to see that spoiled.The stories for Carrie and Charlotte repackaged themes from the series instead of moving them into new territory.  Carrie and Big repeat their pattern of on-again/ off-again romance.  Charlotte&#8217;s story is once again all about babies.  Yes, it was humorous to see Carrie get carried away by wedding preparations, and sweet to see Charlotte radiant with her pregnancy, but why not give us something new (aside from outfits)?  Show Carrie and Big tackling a problem as a couple, and have Charlotte explore something non-reproductive.Miranda&#8217;s conflict with Steve seemed like empty drama thrown in purely to give her something important to say to Big.  The issue was given no meaningful exploration, nor did the characters appear to grow at all from their experiencesSamantha&#8217;s story was, in my opinion, the strongest as we saw the lengths she was willing to go to for love.  There was just one problem.  I really liked Smith.  He stuck by Samantha and supported her through cancer, was devoted to her, offered no criticism or spite when she had sex with Richard, and above all challenged her to move out of the comfortable shell she&#8217;d snuggled in for so long.  He was genuine, if young, and seemed good for Samantha. The demise of their relationship left me disappointed and sad.The movie was OK.  It had its moments, but I prefer to leave Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha where they were in the series finale, happy and well-partnered, and dismiss the events of this film",3,They Could Have Done Better,1394496000,"03 11, 2014",2014,1884,"['enjoyed', 'seeing', 'characters', 'again', 'experiencing', 'once', 'more', 'weave', 'humor', 'drama', 'touching', 'emotion', 'made', 'fan', 'show', 'didn', '8217', 'direction', 'movie', 'took', '8217', 's', 'problem', 'when', 'series', 'characters', 'sublimely', 'placed', 'future', 'love', 'where', 'ended', 'don', '8217', 'want', 'see', 'spoiled.The', 'stories', 'Carrie', 'Charlotte', 'repackaged', 'themes', 'series', 'instead', 'moving', 'new', 'territory', 'Carrie', 'Big', 'repeat', 'pattern', 'on-again/', 'off-again', 'romance', 'Charlotte', '8217', 's', 'story', 'once', 'again', 'babies', 'Yes', 'was', 'humorous', 'see', 'Carrie', 'get', 'carried', 'away', 'wedding', 'preparations', 'sweet', 'see', 'Charlotte', 'radiant', 'pregnancy', 'why', 'not', 'give', 'something', 'new', 'aside', 'outfits', 'Show', 'Carrie', 'Big', 'tackling', 'problem', 'couple', 'have', 'Charlotte', 'explore', 'something', 'non-reproductive.Miranda', '8217', 'conflict', 'Steve', 'seemed', 'empty', 'drama', 'thrown', 'purely', 'give', 'something', 'important', 'say', 'Big', 'issue', 'was', 'given', 'meaningful', 'exploration', 'did', 'characters', 'appear', 'grow', 'experiencesSamantha', '8217', 'story', 'was', 'opinion', 'strongest', 'saw', 'lengths', 'was', 'willing', 'go', 'love', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'problem', 'really', 'liked', 'Smith', 'stuck', 'Samantha', 'supported', 'cancer', 'was', 'devoted', 'offered', 'criticism', 'spite', 'when', 'had', 'sex', 'Richard', 'challenged', 'move', 'comfortable', 'shell', '8217', 'd', 'snuggled', 'so', 'long', 'was', 'genuine', 'young', 'seemed', 'good', 'Samantha', 'demise', 'relationship', 'left', 'disappointed', 'sad.The', 'movie', 'was', 'OK', 'had', 'moments', 'prefer', 'leave', 'Carrie', 'Charlotte', 'Miranda', 'Samantha', 'where', 'were', 'series', 'finale', 'happy', 'well-partnered', 'dismiss', 'events', 'film']",N/A
1180041,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001DDBCUA,Turfseer,"[1, 3]","I used to watch the TV series on HBO on occasion and found it to be (as one reviewer here put it) ""light and witty"". Sex and the City (The Movie) is much more heavy handed. There were few laughs during the screening I saw. Let's face it, Sex and the City is for the most part a glorified  soap opera.The main plot revolves around Chris Noth's Mr. Big getting cold feet just as he's about to get married to Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie. Mr. Big is nothing more than a big wuss--a one dimensional character who unconvincingly hurts Carrie's feelings at a crucial moment in their relationship. Two thirds through the film, Carrie suddenly realizes that she's responsible for the breakup--that she pushed Mr. Big into having a big wedding even though he didn't want it. But her insight is short-lived. When Miranda reveals that she ran into Mr. Big the night before the wedding and told him how horrible marriage is in general (she's upset because she just had a run-in with her estranged husband), Carrie (very narcissisticly) won't cut her best friend any slack.I had trouble with the denouement when Carrie and Mr. Big reconcile--I basically had trouble beliving that Mr. Big would have called off the wedding in the first place (he had ample time to call it off before and he knew how much the woman he loved would be devastated had he called it off at the last minute--but he goes ahead and inexplicably does it anyway).Why also would Mr. Big fall for such a confused person as Carrie, who wanted a showpiece wedding? And then suddenly at the end Carrie sees the error of her ways and now a wedding before a municipal judge is okay? I suppose the happy ending is obligatory in a movie like this but it would have been more intriguing if Carrie had remained true to her neurotic core.Samantha, whose character has the most comic possibilities, is wasted here. She's stuck waiting for her boyfriend to get back from work with her sushi dinner which she's placed all over her body. Not funny! And I didn't believe for a minute that she would remain true to her boyfriend with sexy hunk Dante beckoning her in every scene.For awhile, Charlotte has nothing much to do but get sick from the water while in Mexico and soil herself (again not funny!). More predictable shenanigans occur when Charlotte gets pregnant and has a baby (it's all heartfelt but nothing very dramatic).Finally there's Miranda's relationship with Steve which was perhaps the most realistic part of the movie; although Cynthia Nixon's character oftentimes became too mean and shrill for the audience to have much sympathy for her.As an actress, Jennifer Hudson will always do best in soap operas (the love fest between Carrie and her character was devoid of any meaningful conflict).Sex and the City would have worked much better had about 45 minutes of footage been edited from the final cut. Had more thought been put into the plot, it would have been a much better film. Still, the performances are entertaining and it will pretty much keep you interested to the end.",3,Strictly for die-hard fans,1237507200,"03 20, 2009",2009,3038,"['used', 'watch', 'TV', 'series', 'HBO', 'occasion', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'reviewer', 'here', 'put', 'light', 'witty', 'Sex', 'City', 'Movie', 'much', 'more', 'heavy', 'handed', 'were', 'few', 'laughs', 'screening', 'saw', 'Let', 'face', 'Sex', 'City', 'most', 'part', 'glorified', 'soap', 'opera.The', 'main', 'plot', 'revolves', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'getting', 'cold', 'feet', 'just', 'get', 'married', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Carrie', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'nothing', 'more', 'big', 'wuss', 'one', 'dimensional', 'character', 'who', 'unconvincingly', 'Carrie', 'feelings', 'crucial', 'moment', 'relationship', 'Two', 'thirds', 'film', 'Carrie', 'suddenly', 'responsible', 'breakup', 'pushed', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'having', 'big', 'wedding', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'insight', 'short-lived', 'When', 'Miranda', 'ran', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'night', 'wedding', 'told', 'how', 'horrible', 'marriage', 'general', 'upset', 'just', 'had', 'run-in', 'estranged', 'husband', 'Carrie', 'very', 'narcissisticly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cut', 'best', 'friend', 'slack.I', 'had', 'trouble', 'denouement', 'when', 'Carrie', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'reconcile', 'basically', 'had', 'trouble', 'beliving', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'would', 'have', 'called', 'off', 'wedding', 'first', 'place', 'had', 'ample', 'time', 'call', 'off', 'knew', 'how', 'much', 'woman', 'loved', 'would', 'be', 'devastated', 'had', 'called', 'off', 'last', 'minute', 'ahead', 'inexplicably', 'anyway', '.Why', 'also', 'would', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'fall', 'such', 'confused', 'person', 'Carrie', 'who', 'wanted', 'showpiece', 'wedding', 'then', 'suddenly', 'end', 'Carrie', 'error', 'ways', 'now', 'wedding', 'municipal', 'judge', 'okay', 'suppose', 'happy', 'ending', 'obligatory', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'intriguing', 'Carrie', 'had', 'remained', 'true', 'neurotic', 'core.Samantha', 'character', 'most', 'comic', 'possibilities', 'wasted', 'here', 'stuck', 'waiting', 'boyfriend', 'get', 'back', 'work', 'sushi', 'dinner', 'placed', 'body', 'Not', 'funny', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'minute', 'would', 'remain', 'true', 'boyfriend', 'sexy', 'hunk', 'Dante', 'beckoning', 'scene.For', 'awhile', 'Charlotte', 'nothing', 'much', 'do', 'get', 'sick', 'water', 'Mexico', 'soil', 'again', 'not', 'funny', 'More', 'predictable', 'shenanigans', 'occur', 'when', 'Charlotte', 'pregnant', 'baby', 'heartfelt', 'nothing', 'very', 'dramatic', '.Finally', 'Miranda', 'relationship', 'Steve', 'was', 'perhaps', 'most', 'realistic', 'part', 'movie', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'character', 'oftentimes', 'became', 'too', 'mean', 'shrill', 'audience', 'have', 'much', 'sympathy', 'her.As', 'actress', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'will', 'always', 'do', 'best', 'soap', 'operas', 'love', 'fest', 'Carrie', 'character', 'was', 'devoid', 'meaningful', 'conflict', '.Sex', 'City', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'much', 'better', 'had', '45', 'minutes', 'footage', 'been', 'edited', 'final', 'cut', 'Had', 'more', 'thought', 'been', 'put', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'Still', 'performances', 'are', 'entertaining', 'will', 'pretty', 'much', 'keep', 'interested', 'end']",N/A

It's a beautiful set that contains the unrated version of the film (fans will enjoy the extra scenes that have seamlessly been added to the theatrical cut), special features on the first disc is commentary by writer and director Michael Patrick King.  King does great commentary on the film, much like he did on selected episodes of the series on DVD.  It's interesting to listen to him and exactly how much thought and care went into every aspect of telling these women's story.Disc two contains an abundant collection of special features.  Fan no doubt will love the featurette on the costumes in the film and interview with legendary costume designer, Patricia Field.  There are also featurette's about the making of the film and the women of 'Sex and the City' among others.  Multiple deleted scenes are another added bonus on the second disc of the set.Disc three of the set contains more features.  There's one featurette about the 'Vogue' photo shoot from the film, another about the party to celebrate the DVD release of the film, however, the highlight of this third disc is a conversation between Sarah Jessica Parker and Michael Patrick King about the making of the film.  It's fun to not only hear his thoughts, but Parker's as well and you'll be amazed by just how hands on she was in the making of this film and how obviously important it was for her to tell a story that will make the fans happy.Disc four is a CD containing music from or inspired by the series.  It's a cute little added, bonus, but not one that is integral to this collection.Overall, fans will be very happy with this set, but be warned, if you're not a hardcore fan of the series this set will just seem frivolous and a waste of money.

Let me say this, you don't even have to be a fan of the show to enjoy it.  The movie explains lot's of stuff about the relations between the characters. I'm not saying everything, but you get the idea.So colorful and lively, I loved this movie. It's nice to see a romantic movie without comedic twist. The movie feels so natural, I haven't felt a single dull moment.Fans of the show may have found some flaws, but I'm not.

One, it is very predictable, from the beginning to the eye-rolling end. It wants to be over the top, but it's missing the wonderful element that the show possessed. It has no heart. There is no passion, no romance and, surprisingly, no sex.All the characters lead predictable boring lives. There are a few bumps, especially for Miranda, but even that plot has a predictable end. Charlotte is the perfect one, with the perfect life and perfect husband and child. Again, what happens to her in the film, everyone should have seen coming from a mile away.Samantha is the same, spunky and over the top, but her storyline falls flat as well. Again, perhaps it is the lack of sex. Very dissapointing.Carrie, my least favorite character in the show continues the tradition in the film to an annoying level. Honestly, I don't know how Big could ever have gotten with her. Speaking of Big; yes, predictable as well.Like I said, it is a long movie, that really doesn't need to be. They need to cut out the boring fat and then it would have been quite decent.

The organization is housed in an elegant old townhouse that filmmakers often use for exterior shots. Well, imagine my amusement when Carrie and Mr. Big are given a tour of the ""most beautiful NY apartment."" I had to laugh - the entrance and the big white room with the French windows is where I've crossed thousands of times (along with other $40K a year office drones!) on my way to a meeting. That room is on the first floor, but they made it look like the penthouse! Bogus. So unlike most of the viewers, I couldn't lose myself in the fantasy! And that's what irks me about this film, none of it can be taken seriously, unlike the TV show. Everybody is dressed to the nines and the whole film feels like a long infocommerical for Bag Borrow or Steal, bridal designers, and Diane Von Furstenberg. From the first shot of Carrie wearing an obscenely ugly big flower dress to the flashy, oversized dresses and to perhaps the ugliest wedding dress I've ever seen - the Vivienne Westwood gown that is all about excess, not style - nothing is life-sized. Ironically Mr. Big wanted to be Mr. Modest - and got pummeled for it! Considering the excess on display around him, it came as no suprise that anybody who dared bring down an overdressed, spoiled NYC princess to earth should get hit. The same with the cheating husband of Miranda - he punctured her balloon of self-righteousness. I felt sorry for Jennifer Hudson - it was such an apparent attempt to ""multiculturalize"" the series by bringing in a black character, but she played a role that was no different than from that of a maid in the bad old days of Hollywood. Instead of making her an equal (a rich black woman), they made her a sappy Girl Friday who is as shallow and hungry for fashion and excess as her boss. When Carrie gave her the Louis Vutton bag I had to squirm. The moral is clear - anybody who loves material things is good; all other people are idiots. The only attempt to challenge this is at the end, when Carrie gives in to Mr. Big's wishes, but by that time, all the fashion show fantasy has been exhausted, and their wedding feels like a post-party afterthought. A hypocritical ending that tries to say ""money and fashion isn't everything"" that is so half-hearted.

""Me!""","[2, 2]","I don't know if this script was written by a man or a gay man, but it's got to be one of the two for the script to be this disconnected from women and the original series.  I will try to not put any spoilers in my review.First off I have to say that I loved the series and felt that the way it ended was superb.  I felt they ruined that superb ending with this movie.  The series is about 4 women who have been great friends for many years and support each other through the hard times and the good and share in each other's quest for love, security or pleasure (depending on the character).  In the movie this support for each other goes down the drain when one of the girls gets cheated on by her man.  She decides to separate from him... do the girls support her in her very sane decision to do this, like they would have in the series?  Nope.  They pretty much gang up on her for not allowing his ""little mistake"" and forgiving him.  And they do all act like it's a no big deal thing that should be swept under the rug and that she's being a drama queen for nothing.  From Samantha perhaps this would be acceptable because of her attitude towards monogamy, (though even she broke up with a man for cheating on her during the later seasons), but it is completely out of character for all the characters to do this to their ""friend"" not to mention completely unrealistic.  Especially since during the season something simular happened to the other characters and they were completely supported when THEY broke off their relationships due to this same reason.Another thing that was bad was the fashion.  The director tried too hard to make these girls look ""fabulous"" to the point where they were dressed completely out of character at times.  Miranda during the series never wore ultra bright colors and unprofessional attire because she is a lawyer and this attire would not suit her character.  In this movie it changes and suddenly she's walking down the street wearing colors that are too loud for her skin tone and going to work in clothing that is not appropriate for the office.  Even the other girls are sometimes too done up.  During the series the characters were fashion conscious, but it was natural looking rather than looking like they were TRYING.  It seems somebody put more attention on the fashion the girls were wearing rather than the actual script and movie.There are other points I could mention specifically about the script that I felt was lacking, but to save this review from being too long I'll just conclude here and say that this movie was a disappointment and really brings down a rare series that had great writing and good performances.",1,Just Awful.
