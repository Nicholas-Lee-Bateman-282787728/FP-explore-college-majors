1029857,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000JYW5BE,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","The Fugitive - U.S. MarshalsThe 1993 movie ""The Fugitive"" is great entertainment. Some say it was based on a true crime, the conviction of a surgeon for murder in Cleveland Ohio in 1954. A dozen years later lawyer F. Lee Bailey sued for a new and fair trial based on the biased newspaper coverage; the conviction was then overturned. ""The Wrong Man"" by James Neff is the latest book on this interesting case. A fictional novel is always better when it is based on a true crime. This is a murder mystery, an example of wrongful conviction, an escape and action movie, plus an expose or warning about a corporation that applies for a fraudulent patent on a medicine. It alone makes this product a good buy.""U. S. Marshals"" from 1998 is a sequel that uses most of the same characters from the earlier movie. It is an old Hollywood tradition to produce another movie based on an earlier successful movie. ""Jaws"" was followed by ""Jaws 2"" and ""Jaws 3"" (with diminishing returns). The 1931 movie ""Dracula"" was followed by innumerable sequels that used the same idea of a powerful monster that attacked humanity but was defeated in the end. The market for this story died out around 1945. ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"" marked the end of the series. Real concerns of the people led to new horror movies that echoed the threat from invaders from another planet. Some symbolized the threat from atomic warfare. This movie is not as good as the original ,perhaps due to the plot (it has plenty of action). The idea of an innocent man charged with a double murder may have been inspired by a famous court case from 1995. Could this interesting idea from a true crime have failed due to its echo of a controversial crime that was unsolved? Or did parts of the story seem too incredible to the audience?",5,Hunting for a Wanted Man,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,1796,"['Fugitive', 'U.S.', 'MarshalsThe', '1993', 'movie', 'Fugitive', 'great', 'entertainment', 'say', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'crime', 'conviction', 'surgeon', 'murder', 'Cleveland', 'Ohio', '1954', 'dozen', 'years', 'later', 'lawyer', 'F.', 'Lee', 'Bailey', 'sued', 'new', 'fair', 'trial', 'based', 'biased', 'newspaper', 'coverage', 'conviction', 'was', 'then', 'overturned', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'James', 'Neff', 'latest', 'book', 'interesting', 'case', 'fictional', 'novel', 'always', 'better', 'when', 'based', 'true', 'crime', 'murder', 'mystery', 'example', 'wrongful', 'conviction', 'escape', 'action', 'movie', 'expose', 'warning', 'corporation', 'fraudulent', 'patent', 'medicine', 'alone', 'product', 'good', 'buy.', 'U', 'S.', 'Marshals', '1998', 'sequel', 'most', 'same', 'characters', 'earlier', 'movie', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'tradition', 'produce', 'movie', 'based', 'earlier', 'successful', 'movie', 'Jaws', 'was', 'followed', 'Jaws', '2', 'Jaws', '3', 'diminishing', 'returns', '1931', 'movie', 'Dracula', 'was', 'followed', 'innumerable', 'sequels', 'used', 'same', 'idea', 'powerful', 'monster', 'attacked', 'humanity', 'was', 'defeated', 'end', 'market', 'story', 'died', 'out', '1945', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'Meet', 'Frankenstein', 'marked', 'end', 'series', 'Real', 'concerns', 'people', 'led', 'new', 'horror', 'movies', 'echoed', 'threat', 'invaders', 'planet', 'symbolized', 'threat', 'atomic', 'warfare', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'perhaps', 'due', 'plot', 'plenty', 'action', 'idea', 'innocent', 'man', 'charged', 'double', 'murder', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'inspired', 'famous', 'court', 'case', '1995', 'Could', 'interesting', 'idea', 'true', 'crime', 'have', 'failed', 'due', 'echo', 'controversial', 'crime', 'was', 'unsolved', 'did', 'parts', 'story', 'seem', 'too', 'incredible', 'audience']",The Fugitive / U.S. Marshals

1029893,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000JYW5BE,Trevor Willsmer,"[23, 25]","More than a decade on, The Fugitive holds up surprisingly well, managing to neatly avoid the usual pitfalls of TV-series-to-movie crossovers by opting to tell a single self-contained story rather than trying to set up a new franchise. Thus Harrison Ford's Richard Kimble doesn't go on the road helping strangers resolve their problems because he's too busy trying to evade capture, prove his innocence and catch his wife's killer, making for an entirely satisfying manhunt thriller that stands on its own merits. Chief among them is Tommy Lee Jones, taking over from a dying Richard Jordan and walking off with the movie as his dogged pursuer, getting all the best lines and effortlessly outshining the film's star.Structurally the follow-up, U.S. Marshals, is a reworking of the original, fulfilling the classic sequel brief of ""the same but different"": the producers substitute an incredibly impressive plane crash for the incredibly impressive train crash, a fall from a tall building for a fall from a dam and government defense secrets for drugs trials while throwing in the same plot device of an ally who turns out to be an enemy. The main difference here is no Harrison Ford, more Tommy Lee Jones and added Wesley Snipes (presumably on the run from the taxman) and Robert Downey Jr. (who really should have kept the sunglasses on until he finished rehab). There are no surprises, it's somewhat overlong and you won't remember it a day later, but it's energetically directed by Stuart Baird and superbly edited by Terry Rawlings and does its job effectively enough while you're watching it.",4,The running men,1165795200,"12 11, 2006",2006,1597,"['More', 'decade', 'Fugitive', 'up', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'managing', 'neatly', 'avoid', 'usual', 'pitfalls', 'TV-series-to-movie', 'crossovers', 'opting', 'tell', 'single', 'self-contained', 'story', 'rather', 'trying', 'set', 'up', 'new', 'franchise', 'Thus', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Richard', 'Kimble', ""n't"", 'go', 'road', 'helping', 'strangers', 'resolve', 'problems', 'too', 'busy', 'trying', 'evade', 'capture', 'prove', 'innocence', 'catch', 'wife', 'killer', 'making', 'entirely', 'satisfying', 'manhunt', 'thriller', 'own', 'merits', 'Chief', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'taking', 'over', 'dying', 'Richard', 'Jordan', 'walking', 'off', 'movie', 'dogged', 'pursuer', 'getting', 'best', 'lines', 'effortlessly', 'outshining', 'film', 'star.Structurally', 'follow-up', 'U.S', 'Marshals', 'reworking', 'original', 'fulfilling', 'classic', 'sequel', 'brief', 'same', 'different', 'producers', 'substitute', 'incredibly', 'impressive', 'plane', 'crash', 'incredibly', 'impressive', 'train', 'crash', 'fall', 'tall', 'building', 'fall', 'dam', 'government', 'defense', 'secrets', 'drugs', 'trials', 'throwing', 'same', 'plot', 'device', 'ally', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'enemy', 'main', 'difference', 'here', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'more', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'added', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'presumably', 'run', 'taxman', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'who', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'sunglasses', 'finished', 'rehab', 'are', 'surprises', 'somewhat', 'overlong', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remember', 'day', 'later', 'energetically', 'directed', 'Stuart', 'Baird', 'superbly', 'edited', 'Terry', 'Rawlings', 'job', 'effectively', 'enough', ""'re"", 'watching']",The Fugitive / U.S. Marshals
