Also appearing is Yaphet Kotto (Alien, Midnight Run), Jeffrey DeMunn (The Hitcher, The Green Mile), Richard A. Dysart (Pale Rider, ""L.A. Law""), G.W. Bailey (A Force of One, Police Academy), Jerry Hardin (Cujo, ""The X-Files""), and Rick Rossovich (Top Gun, Roxanne, Navy Seals).Kathleen Quinlan plays Joanie Morse, a security guard at Biotek Agronomics, a company, who on the surface, appears to be in the business of developing bio-engineered crops aka Frankenfoods, but is in actuality a gooberment front for a biological warfare facility.  After a series of unfortunate events an incident occurs, one that forces Joanie to initiate a complete lockdown of the facility (seems a vial containing a particularly vile and communicable germ was damaged, infecting nearly everyone in the building).  As Major Connolly (Kotto) and his containment team make the scene in their unmarked vehicles (let the cover up begin), Joanie's husband, Cal Morse, the sheriff in these parts, tries to figure out what's going on, enlisting the aid of a former Biotek worker named Dr. Dan Fairchild (DeMunn).  Things get a little hairy inside the facility, as people begin dropping like flies (Joanie seems strangely unaffected), but guess what?  The individuals infected aren't actually dying...far from it...the man-made germ, in fact, has the effect of making its victims scabby, angry, and eventually homicidal, proving yet again it's not nice to fool with Mother Nature.  Connolly sends in a team supposedly in an effort to recover the anti-toxin, but things go sour, eventually forcing Cal (who's a serious germophobe) and Dan to take matters into their own hands, to break into the facility to rescue Joanie, who appears to hold the key to the cure.  Cal and Dan run into serious resistance of the psychotic kind, as those inside, taken by the germ, aren't really receptive to visitors, and family members outside are growing hostile over the load of malarkey Connolly keeps dishing out (he initially claimed there had been an outbreak of a yeast infection within the building...oh bruther, break out the Monistat 3).  Exactly what kind of toxicological agent got released within the building?  What is its purpose and effects?  Why wasn't Joanie infected?  How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?All in all I really enjoy this entertaining little feature, despite a number of perceived sticking points within the plot.  I suppose one of my biggest issues was Joanie being able to communicate with Cal on a C.B. radio after the facility had been quarantined...talk about your security gaps.  And it's not like it was a big secret or anything, as Connolly was fully aware of it (he even used Cal's radio to talk to Joanie once or twice).  Given the secretive nature of the facility, I would have thought a quarantine situation would have also included a complete communication blackout from the outside world to prevent erroneous information from being leaked out, especially given the lengths Connolly was going to assuage the public with his preconceived responses to their questions.  I did like how Connolly's containment team was able to patch into the security system on the building from an outside receptacle.  Something else...seems to me if'n your dealing with organisms of such a dangerous nature, I'd think there'd be some sort of internal safeguard, one that could be activated from the outside, in case of dire emergency, a safeguard that would eliminate any and all living entities within the facility...perhaps a harsh solution, but given the nature of the work and the potential threat involved, an appropriate one.  A bit I did like was how Joanie's security access code, the one enabling her to reverse the containment measures (steel doors, etc.) was automatically disabled after the containment action was enabled.  This seemed to make a lot of sense, as you wouldn't want those inside, individuals wracked with fear and desperation (not to mention disease), utilizing the code to free themselves prematurely and endangering the rest of us.  Some of the weaknesses I perceived in the plot felt like a result of being there as a matter of convenience, allowing for other events to follow, as looked at times the writers may have painted themselves into a corner.  Based on the fact I enjoyed the film, I had little problem letting a lot of this slide.  I've always been a fan of Ms. Quinlan, although I must say I think she looks much more attractive with longer hair (she did make that security guard uniform look good, though).  I thought her performance her was good, and I appreciated the fact that she was a strong female figure with human qualities who could take care of herself up to a point (being rushed and overtaken by five psychotics doesn't count).  I didn't really feel the chemistry between her and Waterston, but perhaps that was because I have a slight `thing' for her ever since I saw her in the film Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983).  Some have used the term `zombie' in relation to this film, but I think that's a misnomer as those infected weren't really dead.  They seemed like they were cognizant, fully aware of themselves and others, and able to communicate, their main issues being uncontrollable anger and a propensity towards scabbing.  The story moves along pretty well with good intensity, although it did drag a little at some points, and the production values are better than average.  This, tied with competent performances, made for an entertaining ride.  I could have done without the schmaltzy ending, but whatever...I think my favorite bit was when the local yokels, taking matters into their own hands, decide they're going to break into the facility by taking a blowtorch to the steel containment doors.  Given Connolly's reluctance to share information, they didn't have much of an idea of what they might eventually let loose, but I was surprised how easily these goons were able to overtake the military on hand, especially given the danger posed if the infection ever got loose.  Connolly and his group had some definite security issues...Anchor Bay Entertainment provides a sharp looking widescreen (1.85:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, print here, along with a solid Dolby Digital Surround 2.0 audio track.

As time has gone on and I have become more (and less) discerning regarding Science Fiction, horror and zombie movies, I have come to regard this movie as one of the best of all three. Certainly one of the highpoints of the 80s Science Fiction entries.This movie came out at the same time as ""The Stuff"", but ""Warning Sign"" is a more refined and seemingly a much higher budget movie. It has a very slick look when compared to ""The Stuff"". It even looks pretty good when compared to ""Aliens"".**********************Spoilers Below*************************The movie starts out as an average workday at BioTek, the Head of Security, Joanie Morse played by Kathleen Quinlan is going through her end of the day checks and talking to her husband, Cal Morse, the town's sheriff and aspiring lawyer played by Sam Waterston as he's on routine patrol. Something goes wrong. She initiates a security protocol. Yaphet Kotto plays Major Connolly who heads up the US response team who arrives in short succession. Townspeople, unaware of the danger begin to form a mob, headed by Vic played by Jerry Hardin (X-Files, Star Trek the Next Generation). Inside, bands of roving scientists, technicians and workers break out of containment areas and infection begins to spread while the infected begin to act irrationally. Several bands of people in the plant attempt different strategies, from holing up to finding a magical antitoxin. G.W. Bailey (Sgt. Rizzo from M*A*S*H* TV Series) plays Tom Schmidt who is trying to administer the antitoxin after overcoming disbelief at the accident, thinking its a mixup for the first half of the movie. Richard Dysart plays Dr. Neilsen (""The Thing"", ""The Prophecy""), the head of the research team working on the virus and becomes the most violent infected person, taking charge of a dangerous band of infected people who attempt to hide the accident in infected mind irrational perspective, which involves lots of smashing and trying to infect the uninfected. Cal Morse contacts Dan Fairchild played by Jeffrey DeMunn, a former employee at BioTek for more help to try to get Joanie Morse out when she seems to be uninfected. The government sends in a containment team which is overtaken by Dr. Neilsen's infected team inside the plant and Major Connolly decides to initiate a lockdown to contain the infection and minimize the spread of the infection. Sheriff Morse and Dan Fairchild then break into the plant to attempt to rescue Joanie Morse and find the secret to the spread of the disease.***************************End of Spoilers***************************First off, the acting is very good for a movie of this genre. Kathleen Quinlan, Sam Waterston, Jeffrey DeMunn, Richard Dysart, Yaphet Kotto and G.W. Bailey all deserve some recognition for their acting. I like Jerry Hardin's Sci-Fi work, so I mention him, although his role was a little lacking, there wasn't much to grab on to. Hard to make ""Irrational Redneck"" an Oscar-winning performance.The director uses lots of modulation in the way the character's speak their lines to add emphasis to the dialog and to allow the audience to distinguish the infected from the uninfected. Kathleen Quinlan, when under extreme stress, at one point drops her western accent and produces a pure New York Brooklyn accent. Since she is from California, it isn't an accident, bad editing or bad acting I don't believe. Its meant to convey her stress. The infected people speak in a melodramatic way which seems cheesy, but on closer inspection is a device the director is using to make the audience aware of the mental stress the infection causes. I would liken Barwood's attempt to Clouzot's analysis of characters in ""The Wages of Fear"" or ""Diabolique"", but far less insightful than Clouzot. I fear it may have been lost on most people, though. Perhaps writer/director Barwood tried to do too much for a movie of this type. Maybe ""Towering Infernos"" can't contain deep, socially-conscious points. The movie stretched out a little too far but it is still great and worth watching at least once.The movie isn't a full horror movie. I don't think it was meant to be. Its more in the vein of ""Andromeda Strain"" especially, ""The Crazies"" and ""Quarantine"" to a lesser extent. Its more of a science fiction movie with zombie-ish infection like rage in ""28 Days Later"". Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" makes an excellent counterpoint to this movie. It doesn't pretend to be ponderous, but had infected zombies. ""Warning Sign"" tried to accomplish more, achieve a higher level and missed somewhat. Horror movie fans will find it tame, zombie fans will find it too mild, but the movie doesn't go out of its way to bludgeon you into being afraid. Its not that scary. Its more creepy than scary, but not a common ""Vincent Price""-brand of creepy. The movie breaks itself out as a serious movie with an attempt at social commentary (although fictional?), great makeup effects, a great screenplay, a pretty good ""Dawn of the Dead""-like electronic background score, but tuned up for the 80s. The entire movie has an air of reality similar to ""Andromeda Strain"". It feels like it could be an actually happening, everything is just persuasive enough to make sense, there seems to be an understanding of science written into the screenplay which is rare in zombie movies. Too many zombie movies have taken the approach ""Don't worry about it, just watch the movie"" to the point they slightly insult the intelligence for people who are unable to suspend disbelief. ""Warning Sign"" dots the 'i's and crosses the 't's.I found the ending to be a little mushy and a little too far outside the horror audience to be appreciated. As an adult, I still find it a little crummy, but it works for me ultimately and it provides closure.I have shown this DVD to quite a few people. Everybody who watched it loved it. At least 8/10 stars. Several people who had to leave before the movie was over asked to watch the the movie again to see the ending. Almost everybody I have ever showed it to loved it.Fortunately, Anchor Bay released this title on DVD. One of their best diamonds in the rough, in my opinion.

The story was interesting and I couldn't predict how everything would unfold. I am intrigued that this was made in the early 1980s because many plot elements were probably thought to be sci-fi, while they are quite plausible today (except for the symptoms of the disease). I wasn't impressed with some of the acting, and there were a few gaping plot holes where anyone with a modicum of common sense would've acted differently. But if you view this expecting a diversion from boredom rather than something deep or terrifying, the acting and plot holes won't be too distracting. I was kind of disappointed with the ending, as it seemed like everything just wrapped up too quickly and cleanly. This was so overt, perhaps it was done for effect - but I didn't like the effect.

494474,A2RHV42BTJSVON,B000006GFO,"Liolania ""In2Jesus""","[0, 0]","As a child I think I must have watched this a good 50 times on TV, it played frequently and it was one of my favorites when I was 3-4yrs.  Yes, I was a bit of an odd duck.I find it a little odd that this is classified as Horror, it really is not.  The closest it even comes to it, is when the infected electrocute Joanie because she will not cooperate.  The focus is never on killer, even though there is plenty of that, and that is what distinguishes a horror film from a thrill, a thriller may have kills in it, but it never focus on the blood and guts, whereas a horror film does focus on those things, This film gives little time to the guts and blood of the killings and rather focuses on the how and why the people got like this in the first place.As a child watching this, it always was an exciting movie, and now as an adult, its still a really fun one to watch.  It is also very interesting to view now, after films such as &#34;28 Days Later&#34;, which obviously take inspiration from this  film's overall story and premise. SPOILER:  It actually came to my mind immediately when it was revealed that the people who died from the virus came back as rage-filled killing machine. END SPOILER.This film touches upon a lot of topics, one also that is now coming to the forefront:  Genetically Engeneered crops, or as we called them now:  Genetically Modified Organisms AKA GMO's.  GMO's  are a mutant crop which has genes from other non-plant species ingected in them via laser, in order to make them immune to pesticides.  Ironically, what they describe in the film, is very very close to what we call GMO's, and even the Genetically Modified food is more of a front, and is not what the lab is truly for, it is still a recurring theme in the film, and truly poses the question, can we trust these people who are scientist and claim to know more than we do , that these messed up crops wont really effect the environment at large (at the very least real-life GMO's have actually cross-bred with weeds and created pesticide resistant weeds, which in turn, makes the need for even stronger pesticides).It touches upon man's fear of science and distrust of the government, but sadly, also portrays the masses at large as ignorant idiots who cannot care for themselves and want to break in to a quarantined facility just to get their family out, even though it might mean the destruction of their town and even country.  So while it appears to be speaking out against propaganda, it in turn, possibly promotes it by the end of the film.It is a very complex film that aspires to more than it could possibly achieve on its clearly meager budget, but when it hits its mark, it is a very creepy and effective sci-fi thriller about the danger of man's manipulation of danger, and the pitfalls of blind trust of the government.God Bless ~Amy",5,A Fun Sci-fi Thriller.,1396310400,"04 1, 2014",2014,2839,"['child', 'think', 'must', 'have', 'watched', 'good', '50', 'times', 'TV', 'played', 'frequently', 'was', 'one', 'favorites', 'when', 'was', '3-4yrs', 'Yes', 'was', 'bit', 'odd', 'duck.I', 'find', 'little', 'odd', 'classified', 'Horror', 'really', 'not', 'closest', 'even', 'when', 'infected', 'electrocute', 'Joanie', 'will', 'not', 'cooperate', 'focus', 'never', 'killer', 'even', 'plenty', 'what', 'horror', 'film', 'thrill', 'thriller', 'may', 'have', 'kills', 'never', 'focus', 'blood', 'guts', 'horror', 'film', 'focus', 'things', 'film', 'little', 'time', 'guts', 'blood', 'killings', 'rather', 'focuses', 'how', 'why', 'people', 'got', 'first', 'place.As', 'child', 'watching', 'always', 'was', 'exciting', 'movie', 'now', 'adult', 'still', 'really', 'fun', 'one', 'watch', 'also', 'very', 'interesting', 'view', 'now', 'films', 'such', '34', '28', 'Days', 'Later', '34', 'obviously', 'take', 'inspiration', 'film', 'overall', 'story', 'premise', 'SPOILER', 'actually', 'came', 'mind', 'immediately', 'when', 'was', 'revealed', 'people', 'who', 'died', 'virus', 'came', 'back', 'rage-filled', 'killing', 'machine', 'END', 'SPOILER.This', 'film', 'touches', 'lot', 'topics', 'one', 'also', 'now', 'coming', 'forefront', 'Genetically', 'Engeneered', 'crops', 'called', 'now', 'Genetically', 'Modified', 'Organisms', 'AKA', 'GMO', 'GMO', 'are', 'mutant', 'crop', 'genes', 'other', 'non-plant', 'species', 'ingected', 'laser', 'order', 'make', 'immune', 'pesticides', 'Ironically', 'what', 'describe', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'close', 'what', 'call', 'GMO', 'even', 'Genetically', 'Modified', 'food', 'more', 'front', 'not', 'what', 'lab', 'truly', 'still', 'recurring', 'theme', 'film', 'truly', 'question', 'can', 'trust', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'scientist', 'claim', 'know', 'more', 'do', 'messed', 'up', 'crops', 'wont', 'really', 'effect', 'environment', 'large', 'very', 'least', 'real-life', 'GMO', 'have', 'actually', 'cross-bred', 'weeds', 'created', 'pesticide', 'resistant', 'weeds', 'turn', 'need', 'even', 'stronger', 'pesticides', '.It', 'touches', 'man', 'fear', 'science', 'distrust', 'government', 'sadly', 'also', 'masses', 'large', 'ignorant', 'idiots', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'care', 'want', 'break', 'quarantined', 'facility', 'just', 'get', 'family', 'even', 'might', 'mean', 'destruction', 'town', 'even', 'country', 'So', 'be', 'speaking', 'out', 'propaganda', 'turn', 'possibly', 'end', 'film.It', 'very', 'complex', 'film', 'more', 'could', 'possibly', 'achieve', 'clearly', 'meager', 'budget', 'when', 'mark', 'very', 'creepy', 'effective', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'danger', 'man', 'manipulation', 'danger', 'pitfalls', 'blind', 'trust', 'government.God', 'Bless', '~Amy']",N/A
