Also I have had several encounters with dogs in my neighborhood, and have immediately improved my posture, set my mind to be calm assertive, and the dogs responded.My Dad has tried several of my (Cesar's) suggestions as well, and has had some luck with his energetic and intelligent Chihuahua puppy.

1078189,AHZVF9H0525MQ,B000QXDFSA,"freshbakedmama ""lilian""","[3, 3]","One baffling thing that's become apparent to me since I reacquainted myself with dog ownership in the past few years, is how very, very few dog owners pay any real attention to their dogs.  I know, that statement might be making some of you shake your heads in disbelief.  After all, America is rife with dog-owners who pay a neurotically intense amount of attention to their dogs, right?That's what I thought, too.  Then I finally was able to have a dog of my own after thirty years of dogless-ness, and began spending a good deal of time outdoors with her, among other dog owners and their pets.  What an eye-opener!  So far, I've seen only two dog owners who truly pay attention to what their dogs are &#34;saying&#34; as they interact with people, other animals, and the environment.  The rest are almost completely clueless as to the canine &#34;conversations&#34; happening right under their noses.This must explain why so many people seem to carry an aversion to Cesar's methods, even when they've seen &#34;The Dog Whisperer&#34; at work.If Cesar was hurting or frightening these dogs, you would see it in their bodies.  No amount of editing could hide that, because the dogs would broadcast it loud and clear. That is not what happens, though.  The dogs Cesar works with all visibly relax.  You see the tension going out of their bodies.  If you watch carefully, you'll also see them poke him with their muzzles for attention, and look to him (rather than their owners) for guidance.  This is not the behavior of dogs who've been intimidated.  I've seen that many times, in other places, and it looks nothing like what &#34;Cesar's&#34; dogs express.  I would respectfully suggest that the reason Cesar's detractors see violence and fear at work is because they simply don't yet know dog &#34;language&#34; well enough to decode what they're actually seeing.How do I have the right to make a claim like that?  Well, I'm no recognized expert, but...I was raised with as many as forty dogs living in and around our home, some of which were our summer &#34;tenants&#34;, which we dog-sat.  Most were malamute/husky/wolf mixes, working dogs more than pets, but just as well-known and loved by us as the one non-working dog that lived inside.  We kids had the tasks of feeding, grooming, de-mosquitoing, de-pooping, and generally watching over the dogs.  To someone only accustomed to the behavior of the typical domesticated house dog of modern America, the behavior of these dogs might seem almost alien, but I believe they were actually the more normalized of the two.When one of those dogs acted up, the other dogs immediately corrected it's mistake, sometimes painfully, but never angrily.  The bitches corrected their pups just as immediately and dispassionately.  Dogs and pups who'd been disciplined were never found in the corner feeling sorry for themselves; they demonstrated submission, then got right back into the life of the pack, with no hard feelings.  I never saw any sign that any dog was emotionally &#34;damaged&#34; by the disciplinary fang-baring, nipping, or all-out, forced submission on the ground they received.These dogs were quite capable of seriously injuring or killing their human companions.  Instead, they willingly submitted to all manner of unwanted attention with mosquito-repellant and currying tools, from three young kids.  Why?  Because, having learned by example from the adults, we kids instinctively knew to respect and manage those powerful dogs, according to their canine understanding of social relationships, not our human one.All Cesar is trying to teach people is what their dogs innately understand; that they're dogs, that they only understand doggy-ness, not human-ness, and that they have no problem with being doglike.  What is truly brilliant about his work, I think, is how flexibly he is able to accomodate and work with the various human psychology he encounters, while maintaining the integrity of his canine intentions.  He builds up even the most irrational of the people he works with, when he could easily do just the opposite, which shows that he does indeed have the dogs' best needs at heart.  You can see him adjusting his thinking about the situation and developing compassion for the human &#34;problems&#34; in each case, even as he wades in to rescue the situation for the dog.  That is a person who pays real attention.",5,Cesar is paying attention,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,4396,"['One', 'baffling', 'thing', 'become', 'apparent', 'reacquainted', 'dog', 'ownership', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'how', 'very', 'very', 'few', 'dog', 'owners', 'pay', 'real', 'attention', 'dogs', 'know', 'statement', 'might', 'be', 'making', 'shake', 'heads', 'disbelief', 'America', 'rife', 'dog-owners', 'who', 'pay', 'neurotically', 'intense', 'amount', 'attention', 'dogs', 'right', 'what', 'thought', 'too', 'Then', 'finally', 'was', 'able', 'have', 'dog', 'own', 'thirty', 'years', 'dogless-ness', 'began', 'spending', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'outdoors', 'other', 'dog', 'owners', 'pets', 'What', 'eye-opener', 'So', 'far', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'only', 'two', 'dog', 'owners', 'who', 'truly', 'pay', 'attention', 'what', 'dogs', 'are', '34', 'saying', '34', 'interact', 'people', 'other', 'animals', 'environment', 'rest', 'are', 'almost', 'completely', 'clueless', 'canine', '34', 'conversations', '34', 'happening', 'right', 'noses.This', 'must', 'explain', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'seem', 'carry', 'aversion', 'Cesar', 'methods', 'even', 'when', ""'ve"", 'seen', '34', 'Dog', 'Whisperer', '34', 'work.If', 'Cesar', 'was', 'hurting', 'frightening', 'dogs', 'would', 'see', 'bodies', 'amount', 'editing', 'could', 'hide', 'dogs', 'would', 'broadcast', 'loud', 'clear', 'not', 'what', 'though', 'dogs', 'Cesar', 'visibly', 'relax', 'see', 'tension', 'going', 'bodies', 'watch', 'carefully', ""'ll"", 'also', 'see', 'poke', 'muzzles', 'attention', 'look', 'rather', 'owners', 'guidance', 'not', 'behavior', 'dogs', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'intimidated', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'other', 'places', 'nothing', 'what', '34', 'Cesar', '34', 'dogs', 'express', 'would', 'respectfully', 'suggest', 'reason', 'Cesar', 'detractors', 'see', 'violence', 'fear', 'work', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'yet', 'know', 'dog', '34', 'language', '34', 'well', 'enough', 'decode', 'what', ""'re"", 'actually', 'seeing.How', 'do', 'have', 'right', 'make', 'claim', 'Well', ""'m"", 'recognized', 'expert', 'was', 'raised', 'as', 'many', 'forty', 'dogs', 'living', 'home', 'were', 'summer', '34', 'tenants', '34', 'dog-sat', 'Most', 'were', 'malamute/husky/wolf', 'mixes', 'working', 'dogs', 'more', 'pets', 'just', 'well-known', 'loved', 'one', 'non-working', 'dog', 'lived', 'inside', 'kids', 'had', 'tasks', 'feeding', 'grooming', 'de-mosquitoing', 'de-pooping', 'generally', 'watching', 'dogs', 'someone', 'only', 'accustomed', 'behavior', 'typical', 'domesticated', 'house', 'dog', 'modern', 'America', 'behavior', 'dogs', 'might', 'seem', 'almost', 'alien', 'believe', 'were', 'actually', 'more', 'normalized', 'two.When', 'one', 'dogs', 'acted', 'up', 'other', 'dogs', 'immediately', 'corrected', 'mistake', 'sometimes', 'painfully', 'never', 'angrily', 'bitches', 'corrected', 'pups', 'just', 'immediately', 'dispassionately', 'Dogs', 'pups', 'who', ""'d"", 'been', 'disciplined', 'were', 'never', 'found', 'corner', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'demonstrated', 'submission', 'then', 'got', 'right', 'back', 'life', 'pack', 'hard', 'feelings', 'never', 'saw', 'sign', 'dog', 'was', 'emotionally', '34', 'damaged', '34', 'disciplinary', 'fang-baring', 'nipping', 'all-out', 'forced', 'submission', 'ground', 'received.These', 'dogs', 'were', 'quite', 'capable', 'seriously', 'injuring', 'killing', 'human', 'companions', 'Instead', 'willingly', 'submitted', 'manner', 'unwanted', 'attention', 'mosquito-repellant', 'currying', 'tools', 'three', 'young', 'kids', 'Why', 'having', 'learned', 'example', 'adults', 'kids', 'instinctively', 'knew', 'respect', 'manage', 'powerful', 'dogs', 'according', 'canine', 'understanding', 'social', 'relationships', 'not', 'human', 'one.All', 'Cesar', 'trying', 'teach', 'people', 'what', 'dogs', 'innately', 'understand', ""'re"", 'dogs', 'only', 'understand', 'doggy-ness', 'not', 'human-ness', 'have', 'problem', 'being', 'doglike', 'What', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'work', 'think', 'how', 'flexibly', 'able', 'accomodate', 'work', 'various', 'human', 'psychology', 'maintaining', 'integrity', 'canine', 'intentions', 'up', 'even', 'most', 'irrational', 'people', 'when', 'could', 'easily', 'do', 'just', 'opposite', 'indeed', 'have', 'dogs', 'best', 'needs', 'heart', 'can', 'see', 'adjusting', 'thinking', 'situation', 'developing', 'compassion', 'human', '34', 'problems', '34', 'case', 'even', 'rescue', 'situation', 'dog', 'person', 'who', 'real', 'attention']",Dog Whisperer With Cesar Millan: Season 2

1078195,AOL6BG6SAFGQF,B000QXDFSA,Rufus Quail,"[15, 16]","I defy anyone to watch Dog Whisperer and not get an uplifting surge of good feeling.  The DVD sets make a good gift for anyone who is feeling down.  Cesar and the gang* will cheer them up in no time.The show's typical format might be termed ""Better Homes & Gardens, So-so Dogs.""  Cesar climbs into his fire-engine-red Jeep to make emergency calls at dream homes to help dogs and their owners battle their demons.The root of the problem is that dog owners do not assume the role of ""pack leader.""  They're afraid of hurting the dog's feelings.  Someone has to be in charge, however.  It's not a democracy.Dogs instinctively look to humans for leadership.  The dog world doesn't have indulgent mommies and daddies, just leaders and followers. Dogs are not happy in the unwanted role of de facto pack leader in a human house, so they become unbalanced. They can become unruly monsters.  They might be fearful, obsessive, aggressive, destructive, or insanely protective.  It's fascinating to observe Cesar gently counsel dog and owner alike to assume their natural roles.The show might get stale if it was just Cesar on one emergency call after another.  Blended with these episodes are ones that show Cesar's other public-spirited exploits.  He works with dogs rescued from Hurricane Katrina.  He helps inmates of a women's prison prepare delinquent dogs for adoption.  He helps develop ""service"" dogs.An episode addresses the growing problem of unruly dogs and inconsiderate owners at dog parks.  It may come as a surprise that there is such a thing as dog park etiquette.  The main point: the dog park is not a substitute for the walk.  Walk your dog, THEN visit the park.  Don't think you can turn your dog loose to run amok while you catch up on phone calls.The show has plenty of laughs, from the wacky antics of the dogs and Cesar himself as he mimics dog behavior and comical human body language.Some of the episodes are real tear-jerkers, for example ""Scared Sonny,"" featuring Cyndi Reynolds, who works at a center for humans with special needs (developmental disabilities).  She has rescued Sonny, a feral German Shepherd pup.  Cesar helps Sonny conquer his paralyzing skittishness.  Sonny warms up to the folks at Cyndi's job and starts filling a role as a therapy dog, or service dog, bringing joy to the lives of the center's clients.  As tears well up in Cesar's eyes he says Sonny's story ""will stay with me forever.""  Same here, Cesar.In one episode Cesar shows two clients his ""relaxation space,"" a special enclosure at the Dog Psychology Center replete with futon, buddha statue, plants, etc.  I enjoy these glimpses into Cesar's personal life.  I think a lot of viewers are curious.  His life story would make a good movie.I was surprised to see Cesar's relaxation enclosure because I assumed being with his dogs is all the relaxation he needs.  Just watch him fixing doggie dinner.  Note his blissful look.  He seems so at peace and happy mixing the chow with his hands.  He's proud of the feeding routine he has devised.  You can't get more relaxed than that.A minor gripe:  The viewing experience with the season one DVD set is far better.  National Geographic's excellence in photography is easier to appreciate.

It's a real pleasure to watch Cesar in action with dogs - especially the ""Red Zone"" cases that no one else can help. Cesar's methods are firm, but always humane. I never tire of watching this great show. Watching Cesar diagnose the human caretakers is every bit as interesting as seeing him work with the animals. In my opinion, the production values of Season 2 are definitely superior to season 1. This is a terrific show and I never of it.
