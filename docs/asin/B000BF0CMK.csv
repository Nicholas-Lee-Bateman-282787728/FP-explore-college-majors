941372,A2Y1M5UOCSFTE0,B000BF0CMK,FlickFlack,"[3, 6]","Having missed this show on TV back in 1995, I finally got around to buying it (in 1/2011).  Although the early history of mainframes and minicomputers seems fairly accurate, the subject of early personal computers is very lacking.  Young people who weren't around at the beginning will come away from this production believing that Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak of Apple Computer fame were the innovators of the personal computer.  In fact, they were behind the leading edge by years.  Several PCs were built and sold before the Apple, and the computer that's credited as the first commercially viable PC was the Altair 8800, manufactured by MITS in Albuquerque.  It was so successful that at one time (between 1975 and about 1980), Albuquerque was the center of the burgeoning PC world and the Altair was the standard by which other machines were measured.This video totally and completely avoids any hint of the existence of the Altair.  Even when the subject is changed to a discussion about Bill Gates and Microsoft, they fail to mention that Microsoft's first product was MITS BASIC, which was written for the Altair and which represented the beginning of the Microsoft empire.  The Altair subject is so completely and skillfully avoided that I wonder if the producers or writers might have had some sort of person bias against the company or it's founder (Dr Ed Roberts is generally acknowledged as the father of the PC.  Look him up on Wikipedia or on hundreds of other sites).  The omission is akin to discussing the history of the rocket ship without even a mention of Robert Goddard or of Germany's V2 rocket.Almost every other movie or book about early PC history gives credit where it's due, so this single product doesn't represent the end of of all historical accuracy.  However, it makes one wonder what other important facts might have been slickly glossed over, and it certainly reduces its value as any kind of teaching aid.  I would strongly advise against using it for such purposes.These comments refer to the 1995 show called ""Modern Marvels - The Creation of the Computer"".  The History Channel apparently rehashed the content for a 2005 title called ""Modern Marvels - Computers"".  Others have said that it contains added information about PCs, but I don't know if anything about the Altair was inserted, and unless someone gives me a free copy, I probably won't waste any time on it.",2,A great gaping hole in the history of computers,1296777600,"02 4, 2011",2011,2406,"['Having', 'missed', 'show', 'TV', 'back', '1995', 'finally', 'got', 'buying', '1/2011', 'early', 'history', 'mainframes', 'minicomputers', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'subject', 'early', 'personal', 'computers', 'very', 'lacking', 'Young', 'people', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'around', 'beginning', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'production', 'believing', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'Steve', 'Wozniak', 'Apple', 'Computer', 'fame', 'were', 'innovators', 'personal', 'computer', 'fact', 'were', 'leading', 'edge', 'years', 'Several', 'PCs', 'were', 'built', 'sold', 'Apple', 'computer', 'credited', 'first', 'commercially', 'viable', 'PC', 'was', 'Altair', '8800', 'manufactured', 'MITS', 'Albuquerque', 'was', 'so', 'successful', 'one', 'time', '1975', '1980', 'Albuquerque', 'was', 'center', 'burgeoning', 'PC', 'world', 'Altair', 'was', 'standard', 'other', 'machines', 'were', 'measured.This', 'video', 'totally', 'completely', 'avoids', 'hint', 'existence', 'Altair', 'Even', 'when', 'subject', 'changed', 'discussion', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'Microsoft', 'fail', 'mention', 'Microsoft', 'first', 'product', 'was', 'MITS', 'BASIC', 'was', 'written', 'Altair', 'represented', 'beginning', 'Microsoft', 'empire', 'Altair', 'subject', 'so', 'completely', 'skillfully', 'avoided', 'wonder', 'producers', 'writers', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'sort', 'person', 'bias', 'company', 'founder', 'Dr', 'Ed', 'Roberts', 'generally', 'acknowledged', 'father', 'PC', 'Look', 'up', 'Wikipedia', 'hundreds', 'other', 'sites', 'omission', 'akin', 'discussing', 'history', 'rocket', 'ship', 'even', 'mention', 'Robert', 'Goddard', 'Germany', 'V2', 'rocket.Almost', 'other', 'movie', 'book', 'early', 'PC', 'history', 'credit', 'where', 'due', 'single', 'product', ""n't"", 'represent', 'end', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'However', 'one', 'wonder', 'what', 'other', 'important', 'facts', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'slickly', 'glossed', 'certainly', 'value', 'kind', 'teaching', 'aid', 'would', 'strongly', 'advise', 'using', 'such', 'purposes.These', 'comments', 'refer', '1995', 'show', 'called', 'Modern', 'Marvels', 'Creation', 'Computer', 'History', 'Channel', 'apparently', 'rehashed', 'content', '2005', 'title', 'called', 'Modern', 'Marvels', 'Computers', 'Others', 'have', 'said', 'added', 'information', 'PCs', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Altair', 'was', 'inserted', 'someone', 'free', 'copy', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time']",Modern Marvels: The Creation of the Computer

Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[7, 7]","""The Creation of the Computer"" takes viewers from pre-computer days (hand-calculated tables of tides, logarithms, artillery calculations) through early developments by visionaries such as Charles Babbage's ""Difference Engine"" (working model available in 1832), to Herman Hollerith's punched cards developed in 1880s responding to the Census Bureau's overload, to WWII's use of an early computer to break the Nazi's Enigma code, to the eye-opening (for business applications) 1952 Univac computer that quickly predicted the 1952 election outcome.Computers at this point weighed tons and required extensive maintenance and cooling - not helpful for applications such as space flight.  Fortunately, 1947 brought the development of the transistor, then came the integrated circuit, followed by the microprocessor invented at Intel in response to a Japanese firms request for calculator circuits.Apple then assembled a package that introduced the desktop computer, this was refined per Xerox' development of the mouse and graphical interface, Bill Gates added Microsoft's operating system, and the personal computer soon became omnipresent.",5,Good Overview of an Important Topic!,1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,1135,"['Creation', 'Computer', 'viewers', 'pre-computer', 'days', 'hand-calculated', 'tables', 'tides', 'logarithms', 'artillery', 'calculations', 'early', 'developments', 'visionaries', 'such', 'Charles', 'Babbage', 'Difference', 'Engine', 'working', 'model', 'available', '1832', 'Herman', 'Hollerith', 'punched', 'cards', 'developed', '1880s', 'responding', 'Census', 'Bureau', 'overload', 'WWII', 'use', 'early', 'computer', 'break', 'Nazi', 'Enigma', 'code', 'eye-opening', 'business', 'applications', '1952', 'Univac', 'computer', 'quickly', 'predicted', '1952', 'election', 'outcome.Computers', 'point', 'weighed', 'tons', 'required', 'extensive', 'maintenance', 'cooling', 'not', 'helpful', 'applications', 'such', 'space', 'flight', 'Fortunately', '1947', 'brought', 'development', 'transistor', 'then', 'came', 'integrated', 'circuit', 'followed', 'microprocessor', 'invented', 'Intel', 'response', 'Japanese', 'firms', 'request', 'calculator', 'circuits.Apple', 'then', 'assembled', 'package', 'introduced', 'desktop', 'computer', 'was', 'refined', 'Xerox', 'development', 'mouse', 'graphical', 'interface', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'added', 'Microsoft', 'operating', 'system', 'personal', 'computer', 'soon', 'became', 'omnipresent']",Modern Marvels: The Creation of the Computer

However the progression of the computer to today is extremely dated.  The history drops off just as the desk top computer hits its stride.  This DVD is awesome to show kids of today the big werehouse sized, heavy, power hungry,  hot vaccuum tube powered hulks computers once were.  Todays average smart phone has more computing power then these room sized monsters did in their heyday  This DVD is shares priceless information about the origins of computing but it runs out of steam eventually.
