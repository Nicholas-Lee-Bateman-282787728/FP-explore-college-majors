1121133,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B000Z27HFE,David Baldwin,"[7, 8]","Those buying this flick as a vehicle for Craig Ferguson may be a wee bit disappointed.  It's not that he's invisible here but his actual screen time lags behind his co-stars.  Ferguson is omnipresent serving as the glue to the different story strands.  Truth be told this is kind of a chick flick.  There are three central stories and all involve women front and center.  The main one involves a pregnant waitress contemplating abortion and a career in porn.  Another concerns a harried housewife who considers prostitution to help her family's sagging economic fortunes.  Lastly, a recent female parolee who attempts to regain custody of her child after getting out of prison.  Those going into this film thinking they are getting a comedy will be sadly mistaken.  ""Niagara Motel"" is a comedy alright, a human comedy, which borders on the tragic.  It is interesting and different and not without it's flaws.  It takes a while to latch onto the film's rhythms but once it grabs you will be enthralled.  A definite sleeper worth pursuing.",4,Canadian Crash,1303344000,"04 21, 2011",2011,1037,"['buying', 'flick', 'vehicle', 'Craig', 'Ferguson', 'may', 'be', 'wee', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'not', 'invisible', 'here', 'actual', 'screen', 'time', 'co-stars', 'Ferguson', 'omnipresent', 'serving', 'glue', 'different', 'story', 'strands', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'kind', 'chick', 'flick', 'are', 'three', 'central', 'stories', 'involve', 'women', 'front', 'center', 'main', 'one', 'pregnant', 'waitress', 'contemplating', 'abortion', 'career', 'porn', 'harried', 'housewife', 'who', 'prostitution', 'help', 'family', 'sagging', 'economic', 'fortunes', 'Lastly', 'recent', 'female', 'parolee', 'who', 'regain', 'custody', 'child', 'getting', 'prison', 'going', 'film', 'thinking', 'are', 'getting', 'comedy', 'will', 'be', 'sadly', 'mistaken', 'Niagara', 'Motel', 'comedy', 'alright', 'human', 'comedy', 'tragic', 'interesting', 'different', 'not', 'flaws', 'while', 'latch', 'film', 'rhythms', 'grabs', 'will', 'be', 'enthralled', 'definite', 'sleeper', 'worth', 'pursuing']",Niagara Motel
