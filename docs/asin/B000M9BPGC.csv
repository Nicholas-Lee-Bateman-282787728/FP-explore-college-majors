1044312,A6YUGE5IOB2VP,B000M9BPGC,Barry Allen,"[21, 23]","Beginning with Season Five, the writers of Magnum P.I. began to tinker with the shows format. Something not out of the ordinary when a show reaches beyond the four season mark.  While most of season five's episodes work with this new formula, season six tries to continue with this formula, but instead misses the boat more times than not.  Gone are the days of Magnum swimming on the beach or hanging out at the club to meet a client.  Higgins no longer bargains with Magnum for guest house privlidges, and their customary banter only happens occassionally. This was done perhaps, the emphasize the fact that Magnum was getting older, and several episodes stress the fact that he may soon want to do something else with his life.  Even though Magnum is quick to point out how great Hawaii is, one can get the impression at times that he's searching for something with a little more meaning.Overall, the tone of the season is darker and much more serious.  Come to think of it, most episodes of season six are shot entirely out of Hawaii (Deja Vu, Going Home), and several episodes go by where you see no trace of the guest house or estate for that matter.  Episodes like the previous two mentioned and ""The Way of the Stalking Horse,"" are some of the year's bright spots.  I give the writer's credit for trying to branch out, but Magnum's sharp decline in ratings at this time(Number 8 in 1984 to out of the top 30 by 1985) was an indication that viewers preffered the old formula, and that the show was running out of steam.  All is well however, because season seven and eight revert back (for the most part) to the show's old formula.  Although I have not seen all of these episodes, the one's I have (Missing Melody, Laura, Little Girl Who) are, in my opinion, some of the best of the series.",2,"Not Magnum at its finest hour, but necessary for the collection",1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,1797,"['Beginning', 'Season', 'Five', 'writers', 'Magnum', 'P.I', 'began', 'tinker', 'shows', 'format', 'Something', 'not', 'ordinary', 'when', 'show', 'four', 'season', 'mark', 'most', 'season', 'five', 'episodes', 'work', 'new', 'formula', 'season', 'six', 'tries', 'continue', 'formula', 'instead', 'boat', 'more', 'times', 'not', 'Gone', 'are', 'days', 'Magnum', 'swimming', 'beach', 'hanging', 'out', 'club', 'meet', 'client', 'longer', 'Magnum', 'guest', 'house', 'privlidges', 'customary', 'banter', 'only', 'occassionally', 'was', 'done', 'perhaps', 'emphasize', 'fact', 'Magnum', 'was', 'getting', 'older', 'several', 'episodes', 'stress', 'fact', 'may', 'soon', 'want', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'life', 'Even', 'Magnum', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'how', 'great', 'Hawaii', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'impression', 'times', 'searching', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'meaning.Overall', 'tone', 'season', 'darker', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'Come', 'think', 'most', 'episodes', 'season', 'six', 'are', 'shot', 'entirely', 'Hawaii', 'Deja', 'Vu', 'Going', 'Home', 'several', 'episodes', 'go', 'where', 'see', 'trace', 'guest', 'house', 'estate', 'matter', 'Episodes', 'previous', 'two', 'mentioned', 'Way', 'Stalking', 'Horse', 'are', 'year', 'bright', 'spots', 'give', 'writer', 'credit', 'trying', 'branch', 'out', 'Magnum', 'sharp', 'decline', 'ratings', 'time', 'Number', '8', '1984', 'top', '30', '1985', 'was', 'indication', 'viewers', 'preffered', 'old', 'formula', 'show', 'was', 'running', 'out', 'steam', 'well', 'however', 'season', 'seven', 'eight', 'revert', 'back', 'most', 'part', 'show', 'old', 'formula', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'episodes', 'one', 'have', 'Missing', 'Melody', 'Laura', 'Little', 'Girl', 'Who', 'are', 'opinion', 'best', 'series']",N/A

Really lame. Having a private eye who drives a Ferrari and lives in Hawaii was a great setup, but honestly, the writers had pretty much done what could be done after about twenty episodes. After that, they had simply nowhere credible to go with the idea.By the time we arrive at the fourth and fifth seasons, the writers were so completely out of ideas that every episode was jumping the shark. Nearly every outing was of the same worn ilk: one of Magnum (or Higgins's) long-lost but beloved acquaintances, whom we've never seen before, shows up out of nowhere; is in some sort of trouble, being followed, or wrongly implicated in some skullduggery. In the end, we are invariably relieved to discover that Magnum's ""gut"" was never off, and he always gets his man.Over and over and over again.And by the sixth season?  You get to the point where you'd rather have molten lead poured into your nostrils than watch another minute.I admit I liked the series when I was a kid, but it's just plain torture watching it now.P.S.

1044316,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B000M9BPGC,Craig MACKINNON,"[3, 5]","The sixth season of Magnum is the first time in the series that a season is worse than the one that preceded it.  There are some great shows, to be sure, but watched as a whole (which is the whole point of having a DVD of a season), the writers appeared to be running out of material, or made a concerted effort to emphasize light and comedic storytelling.  While some of my favourite Magnum episodes are the comedic ones, these ones just don't work on the whole.  Even more problematic is when the show tries to find its emotional centre, then turns the occasion into a joke.The most perfect example of how the show fails in Season 6 is the episode ""Mad Dogs and Englishmen"", where Higgins is ""fired"" as Robin's major domo and appears to join a private army attempting a coup.  Higgins is rediculous as a ruthless coup leader, and the idea that such an operation could be hidden in Hawai'i is ludicrous.  The basis of the Higgins-Magnum friendship is military - they both understand and respect each other for the service (even if one is Army and the other is Navy!), so anything that denigrates Higgins's (or Magnum's) military ability is harmful to that relationship and detrimental to the chemistry of the show.Of course, there are many ""real"" Magnum moments, such as his dressing-down by an officious boss while working as a hotel detective, his poignant visit to the Vietnam war memorial, and Higgins willingness to run into a fire to save Magnum.  But for every good moment, there is a painful homage to ""Casablanca,"" a less painful but still bad homage to ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,"" or a visit by Robin Masters's scammer nephew.

1044321,A6A38ESR48ZPK,B000M9BPGC,"grundle2600 ""grundle2600""","[31, 47]","Magnum P.I. is my favorite TV show of all time. It ran for 8 seasons.For me, in my opinion, season 6 is my least favorite season. You may disagree with me on that, and that's fine. But I'm not very fond of most of these episodes. It's largely because of the writing and the plots. Most of these episodes seem quite generic. They don't have that ""Magnumesque"" characteristic that's in the other seasons. With most of these episodes, you could transplant the storyline to some other TV series, and you'd never know that it had originally been a Magnum story.Here are the episodes:Deja Vu - In this two hour episode, Magnum and Higgins travel to England. While Higgins visits Robin Master's castle, Magnum tries to solve a hit and run murder. I find most of this episode to be quite bland and dull. But there is a certain scene that I like toward the end, where John Hillerman (the actor who plays Higgins) plays Higgins's father, whom Higgins hasn't seen since he went off to join the military several decades earlier. T.C. and Rick make token appearances throughout the episode so they could get paid and have their names listed in the credits.Old Acquaintance - Magnum is hired to find a dolphin that had been kidnapped.The Kona Winds - Uh oh. Going very much out of his usual well behaved character, Magnum has sex with a married woman. Bad Magnum! That being said, I think this is one of the better episodes of the season. And I do like how Magnum catches the villain at the end.The Hotel Dick - Magnum gets a job trying to catch a burglar who's been robbing hotel rooms. This is one of the better episodes of this season.Round and Around - Remember those horrible ""afterschool specials"" about teenagers and gangs and crime? Then you've already seen this episode.Going Home - Magnum goes to Tidewater, Virginia, to visit friends and family. Many fans of the series love this episode, but I don't. That being said, I do find the scene where Magnum visits the Vietnam Memorial to be quite moving. Higgins, T.C., and Rick do not appear in this episode.Paniolo - Season 1 had a pretty good episode called ""Adelaide"" which was about horses. This season 6 episode is also about horses, except this episode isn't any good at all.The Treasure of Kalaniopu'u - As a promotion for the latest Robin Masters novel, his publisher has hidden a large sum of money somewhere on the island. So everyone is running around looking for it. Where could it be? Could it be, perhaps, under Higgins's prized flower bed? Well, we better dig up the flowers, just in case. If you want to know why I think season 6 is so bad and unoriginal, look to this episode as an example.Blood and Honor - Magnum gets called back to the Navy to find a mole.Rapture - Magnum sees a ghost. This isn't a horrible episode. But it's nowhere nearly as good as the season 2 episode ""The Woman On The Beach.""I Never Wanted to Go to France, Anyway - Magnum tries to solve a murder at a carnival.Summer School - Proving that the show's writers were really, really having trouble coming up with ideas, Robin Masters's badly behaving nephew comes to visit the estate. Whatever you do, don't show this episode to your friends as their introduction to the series.Mad Dogs and Englishmen - Higgins quits his job at the estate and is replaced by someone else. How creative and thoughtful of the show's writers to replace a long standing regular character who was loved by the audience with someone new that the audience couldn't possibly care about. Yeah! That always makes for great TV. I wish all shows would do that! I just love the second Darren on ""Bewitched,"" and the second Becky on ""Roseanne."" And, most importantly, let's all remember how thankful and grateful we all were when Coy and Vance showed up on ""The Dukes Of Hazzard.""All Thieves on Deck - Magnum guards a valuable Hawaiian statue. I really liked this episode a lot better in season 3 when it was called ""Ki's Don't Lie.""This Island Isn't Big Enough - Magnum looks for Rick and a few other people who had been on Rick's boat but are now missing.Way of the Stalking Horse - Magnum gets shot and doesn't die. Wow! There's an idea that never happened in this show before!Find Me a Rainbow - Magnum is hired to find some stolen jewelry.Who is Don Luis Higgins, and Why is He Doing These Terrible Things to Me? - This is my favorite episode of this season, and I like it so much that I have nothing bad to say about it. This is another one of those episodes with one of Higgins's illegitimate half brothers.A Little Bit of Luck, A Little Bit of Grief - This is another one of those ""afterschool specials."" A bunch of communist brat teenagers wants to prevent a private landowner from using his land as he sees fit.Photo Play - Since the writers decided that they were putting Magnum in the hospital too much, this time they decided to make Agatha the target of their aggression.Yeah, season 6 pretty much sucks. But don't worry - the show didn't ""jump the shark,"" because this was only a temporary lull. Season 7 will bring us some of the very best episodes of the series!

Maybe the writers collectively hit a wall, maybe they just phoned it in after 5 very successful seasons but it's hard to argue that season 6 was up to the level of the previous 5. Even allowing for the inevitable subjectivity involved in such judgments, I think few fans of the show would dispute this.Although every season has its clunkers this season seems to have more absurd, incomprehensible, or just downright inappropriate plots.Examples of absurd plots are ""Blood and Honor"" and ""Mad Dogs and Englishmen"". The plot elements are just unbelievable. In the former we have an admiral insisting on taking delivery of some very sensitive manuals even though he knows there is a spy in his organization! In the latter we have Higgins telling Magnum right out of a clear blue sky that he has been dismissed and expects Magnum to just meekly accept this this despite years of experiencing Magnum's constant intrusions into and curiosity about his personal affairs!""This Island Isn't Big Enough"" just doesn't make any sense at all.""Rapture"" is probably the worst of the season. The use of a ghost to solve a crime is completely inappropriate in a series like Magnum, P I. It's as if McGarrett on Hawaii Five-O convened a seance to track down a killer. Worse, the ghost doesn't even haunt the killer! He haunts his mother (driving her to alcoholism) and Magnum (supplying him with nonsensical ""clues"").But despite this the season is not unwatchable. The cast remains likable and the great chemistry between the characters remains undiminished. And there are good episodes. ""Way of the Stalking Horse"" and ""The Kona Winds"" depict Magnum at his very fallible best and are outstanding.Physically, the DVD set has the same strengths and weaknesses as the season 5 set. On the plus side we now have single sided disks. On the minus side there are five hours on two of the disks which leads to pixilation in a few places. There is not a clue about when the episodes originally aired either on the package or the DVDs proper. The episodes are not divided into convenient chapters. There are no signs of any restoration effort. There is a fine season 7 episode (""Little Girl Who"") included as a bonus.All in all, a necessity for the Magnum fan but not the set to reach for to hook the neophyte.",3,Weak writing makes 6th season the worst thus far...,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,2391,"['means', 'unwatchable.It', 'hard', 'be', 'sure', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'scriptwriting', 'season', '6', 'Maybe', 'writers', 'collectively', 'hit', 'wall', 'maybe', 'just', 'phoned', '5', 'very', 'successful', 'seasons', 'hard', 'argue', 'season', '6', 'was', 'up', 'level', 'previous', '5', 'Even', 'allowing', 'inevitable', 'subjectivity', 'involved', 'such', 'judgments', 'think', 'few', 'fans', 'show', 'would', 'dispute', 'this.Although', 'season', 'clunkers', 'season', 'have', 'more', 'absurd', 'incomprehensible', 'just', 'downright', 'inappropriate', 'plots.Examples', 'absurd', 'plots', 'are', 'Blood', 'Honor', 'Mad', 'Dogs', 'Englishmen', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'just', 'unbelievable', 'former', 'have', 'admiral', 'insisting', 'taking', 'delivery', 'very', 'sensitive', 'manuals', 'even', 'spy', 'organization', 'latter', 'have', 'Higgins', 'telling', 'Magnum', 'right', 'clear', 'blue', 'sky', 'been', 'dismissed', 'Magnum', 'just', 'meekly', 'accept', 'years', 'experiencing', 'Magnum', 'constant', 'intrusions', 'curiosity', 'personal', 'affairs', 'Island', ""n't"", 'Big', 'Enough', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Rapture', 'probably', 'worst', 'season', 'use', 'ghost', 'solve', 'crime', 'completely', 'inappropriate', 'series', 'Magnum', 'P', 'McGarrett', 'Hawaii', 'Five-O', 'convened', 'seance', 'track', 'down', 'killer', 'Worse', 'ghost', ""n't"", 'even', 'haunt', 'killer', 'mother', 'driving', 'alcoholism', 'Magnum', 'supplying', 'nonsensical', 'clues', '.But', 'season', 'not', 'unwatchable', 'cast', 'likable', 'great', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'undiminished', 'are', 'good', 'episodes', 'Way', 'Stalking', 'Horse', 'Kona', 'Winds', 'depict', 'Magnum', 'very', 'fallible', 'best', 'are', 'outstanding.Physically', 'DVD', 'set', 'same', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'season', '5', 'set', 'plus', 'side', 'now', 'have', 'single', 'sided', 'disks', 'minus', 'side', 'are', 'five', 'hours', 'two', 'disks', 'pixilation', 'few', 'places', 'not', 'clue', 'when', 'episodes', 'originally', 'aired', 'package', 'DVDs', 'proper', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'divided', 'convenient', 'chapters', 'are', 'signs', 'restoration', 'effort', 'fine', 'season', '7', 'episode', 'Little', 'Girl', 'Who', 'included', 'bonus.All', 'necessity', 'Magnum', 'fan', 'not', 'set', 'reach', 'hook', 'neophyte']",N/A

Previous to this there was the suggestion that he spent the night with her, now it is confirmed.We were watching the series as a family b/c it was adventurous but still pretty tame compared to what is on broadcast TV these days.

Masters(Tate Donovan) in the ""Summer School"" episode when RJ ends up impersonating Magnum and stealing his murder investigation to gain acknowledgement and respect along with driving a green Ferrari similar to Robin Masters red Ferrari that Magnum always drove.Something else I noticed about the last 3 seasons of MAGNUM, P.I., starting with the Sixth Season was Robin Masters Ferrari was actually newer and more upgraded than it was in the first 5 seasons of MAGNUM, since Robin's Ferrari had the black vents on the hood of the car and had snazzier rims in the 6th, 7th, and 8th Season of MAGNUM, which Robin's Ferrari didn't have in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th Season, which you'd notice if you take a very good look at Robin's Ferrari in the last 3 seasons of MAGNUM and then take a very close look at Robin's Ferrari in the first 5 seasons of MAGNUM all over again, which was especially noticable in the first 3 seasons, since those were the seasons when Magnum(Tom Selleck) drove the Ferrari more along with the fact that MAGNUM, PI was obviously no longer in its honeymoon phase of the show anymore either since the honeymoon phase of this private detective drama was already long gone by MAGNUM's 3rd Season.I'm just surprised that Robin's Ferrari never had a carphone in it, unlike THE A-TEAM van, THE FALL GUY's truck, and Face's Corvette all had, especially since Robin's Ferrari was quite a bit more upgraded than all those vehicles.It was also interesting seeing Clu Gulager in the ""Way Of The Stalking Horse"" episode after seeing him on other popular prime time shows like CHiPs, THE FALL GUY, KNIGHT RIDER, AIRWOLF, etc. prior to that.This MAGNUM, PI-Season Six DVD also includes a cool bonus episode from MAGNUM's Seventh Season such as ""The Little Girl Who"" episode, which my wife and I enjoyed watching, especially since MAGNUM's 1986-87 Season didn't get released till 8 months later after this DVD box set was.MAGNUM's 1985-1986 Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when CBS's motto was ""CBS: We've Got The Touch"", since that was CBS's slogan from the Fall of 1983 thru the Summer of 1986.In addition, MAGNUM's 6th Season was also MAGNUM's last season being on CBS's Thursday night line-up, since CBS had moved MAGNUM to Wednesdays in the Fall of 1986.It was also interesting seeing guest stars like*Meredith Mac Rae in the ""Summer School"" episode after her co-starring days as Billy Jo Bradley on PETTICOAT JUNCTION and BEVERLY HILLBILLIES*Alan Hale in the ""All Thieves On Deck"" episode after his co-starring days as Skipper on GILLIGAN'S ISLAND-Douglas McClure in the ""Paniolo"" episode before his co-starring days as Mayor Applegate on OUT OF THIS WORLD*Phyllis Davis in ""The Hotel Dick"" episode after her co-starring days on VEGAS*Henry Darrow in the ""Paniolo"" episode during his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA and after his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL*Gran Van-Dusen in ""The Hotel Dick"" episode before his co-starring days on PORT CHARLES and THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS*Eddie Barth in the ""Rapture"" episode after his co-starring days as Rick & AJ Simon's retired private-eye buddy(Myron Fowler) on SIMON & SIMONSo now that Universal has released all 8 seasons of MAGNUM, P.I. out on DVD, I'm hoping this has inspired Warner Bros. to finally release the detective drama MATT HOUSTON out on DVD soon, especially since MATT HOUSTON was also a very popular TV show during it's 3-year run on ABC, which by the way was in competition with MAGNUM, since Matlock Houston(Lee Horseley) was a private investigator just like Thomas Magnum(Tom Selleck) was along with the fact that MATT HOUSTON was MAGNUM, PI's biggest rival, despite the intriguing fact that there was an interesting slight resemblence between Magnum and Houston, except Houston was a lot tougher, a lot huskier, a lot spunkier, a lot more organized, and a lot more fortunate than Magnum ever was since Houston was a filthy-rich private-eye from Texas who lived in the L.A. Area to take over a family-business overseas who ran a private detective agency on the side as a hobby, but Magnum was just a beach-bum style private dick who lived on a shoe-string budget and rent-free at the so-called wealthy novelist Robin Masters Estate in Hawaii who only worked when he wanted to.Therefore Magnum(Tom Selleck) was always broke and Houston(Lee Horsley) never was since Houston lived high on the hog in a fancy shmancy penthouse in Hollywood who also had a detective agency in Downtown LA along with the fact that Houston was always rolling in bucks living in luxury and always had foxy women around him, unlike Magnum whose cash-flow problem was often a laugh since Magnum was always barely getting by and struggling to make a living just like the often festidious gumshoe Jim Rockford(James Garner)was on THE ROCKFORD FILES, so Magnum could never even touch Houston for that matter either especially since Houston lived the kind of lifestyle that Magnum envied & would've wished he could've had too, despite the fact that MATT HOUSTON tanked after it's 3-year run on ABC when it was cancelled in the Summer of 1985 since MATT HOUSTON lost a lot of viewers thru MIAMI VICE when it debuted on NBC in the Fall of 1984 since MIAMI VICE was at the same time 10PM time-slot as MATT HOUSTON was.By the way I just got word that Paramount will finally be releasing MATT HOUSTON-Season 1 out on DVD on March 9th, 2010 and SIMON & SIMON will be released on Tuesday April 6th, 2010 and are both now available for pre-order online, so I can hardly wait to add MATT HOUSTON DVD's to my collection along with my MAGNUM DVD box sets.",4,The Mag Rocks!,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,8316,"['1985-86', 'Season', 'DVD', 'detective', 'drama', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'shabby',
