248993,A148R7S0Q4S5W6,6301293428,"Hunyadi ""BC""","[0, 0]",An honest film about a father trying to reconnect with his son after so many years. John Lithgow&#8217;s character is a Special Forces Vietnam veteran with severe Posttraumatic Stress Disorder living in the Washington State wilderness. He lives with other &#8220;bush vets&#8221; with PTSD up in the hills isolated from the world as they live with their own nightmares and intrusive memories. Ralph Macchio&#8217;s character is a high school senior with only vague knowledge of his father by what his mother tells him. A decent movie that could have been stronger but was worth a watch.,3,Decent movie,1387324800,"12 18, 2013",2013,586,"['honest', 'film', 'father', 'trying', 'reconnect', 'son', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'John', 'Lithgow', '8217', 's', 'character', 'Special', 'Forces', 'Vietnam', 'veteran', 'severe', 'Posttraumatic', 'Stress', 'Disorder', 'living', 'Washington', 'State', 'wilderness', 'other', '8220', 'bush', 'vets', '8221', 'PTSD', 'up', 'hills', 'isolated', 'world', 'live', 'own', 'nightmares', 'intrusive', 'memories', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', '8217', 's', 'character', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'only', 'vague', 'knowledge', 'father', 'what', 'mother', 'decent', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'was', 'watch']",N/A

A lot of this acting was wooden...but, that's how some of us are...wooden.I think this movie leaves with more questions asked than answered.  Some of this stuff was typical Hollywood cr*p.  But, enough of it rang close to home.  Not every namvet goes tripwire.  Some integrate totally back into society. Some rejoin partially.  Some not at all.  This injury affects different people different ways.  There is no blanket statement that tell you what it is...and what it is not. Each and every veteran no matter what war is affected by it some way.  Directly or guilt by association, we all get tarred with the same brush.For my generation of Vets, that war will never be over.  But,I promise you one thing, I will do everything within my power to insure that these kids coming back don't get put through the same mental ringer that the majority of our friends and families put us through we were forced to slink thru McCord.There's some good acting here.  Too much of it is too close to real for comfort.",5,"Been there, done that",1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,1098,"['Speaking', 'disabled', 'vietnam', 'vet', 'PTSD', 'could', 'identify', '100', '%', 'Lithgow', 'character', 'lot', 'acting', 'was', 'wooden', 'how', 'are', 'wooden.I', 'think', 'movie', 'more', 'questions', 'asked', 'answered', 'stuff', 'was', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'cr*p.', 'enough', 'close', 'home', 'Not', 'namvet', 'tripwire', 'integrate', 'totally', 'back', 'society', 'rejoin', 'partially', 'not', 'injury', 'different', 'people', 'different', 'ways', 'blanket', 'statement', 'tell', 'what', 'what', 'not', 'veteran', 'matter', 'what', 'war', 'affected', 'way', 'Directly', 'guilt', 'association', 'get', 'tarred', 'same', 'brush.For', 'generation', 'Vets', 'war', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'promise', 'one', 'thing', 'will', 'do', 'everything', 'power', 'insure', 'kids', 'coming', 'back', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'put', 'same', 'mental', 'ringer', 'majority', 'friends', 'families', 'put', 'were', 'forced', 'slink', 'thru', 'McCord.There', 'good', 'acting', 'here', 'Too', 'much', 'too', 'close', 'real', 'comfort']",N/A
