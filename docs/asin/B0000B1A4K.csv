This movie should have come out in America, I think it would have been greatly appreciated. S Club bring a fun variety to the film with each one getting up to their own kind of mischief. And low and behold, the S Club encounter clones of themselves! Some of today's movies for the younger crowd are horrible but this one is fun, good music and interesting throughout! I love this movie and will continue to watch it on those 'Need a Pick-Me-Up' days!",5,Fun and Colorful!,1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,504,"['movie', 'came', 'out', 'while', 'ago', 'still', 'watch', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'America', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'greatly', 'appreciated', 'S', 'Club', 'bring', 'fun', 'variety', 'film', 'one', 'getting', 'up', 'own', 'kind', 'mischief', 'low', 'behold', 'S', 'Club', 'encounter', 'clones', 'today', 'movies', 'younger', 'crowd', 'are', 'horrible', 'one', 'fun', 'good', 'music', 'interesting', 'love', 'movie', 'will', 'continue', 'watch', ""'Need"", 'Pick-Me-Up', 'days']",S Club - Seeing Double

769855,A4KJTS5P78ICU,B0000B1A4K,K. Futrell,"[0, 0]","If you are a fan of S Club than this dvd is for you.  This dvd is about a scientist cloning the members of S Club and S Club trying to figure out how they can be in 2 places at once.S Club gives their manager grief about not having a day off so when they are suppose to catch a flight to LA and they miss thier flight, S Club figures that their manager is giving them time off. Much to their dissmay, their manager was actual kidnapped and cloned along with S Club. When they see themselves on tv Live in LA when they really are still in Spain they know something is wrong. Still left with their hotel bill, the band tries to sneak out of the hotel and get to LA. They get thrown in jail for not paying the hotel bill. They finally get to LA after a few setbacks and kidnap 3 of the clones. S Club and their clones end up working together to get the evil scientist thrown in jail and then S Club and their clones get back to promoting their album in LA.This dvd is way better than Spice World. It has a better story line. This dvd has some great bonus features and it has some great music. If you have not seen this movie yet, be sure you either go and rent it or you buy it.",5,Awesome Dvd,1097539200,"10 12, 2004",2004,1175,"['are', 'fan', 'S', 'Club', 'dvd', 'dvd', 'scientist', 'cloning', 'members', 'S', 'Club', 'S', 'Club', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'can', 'be', '2', 'places', 'once.S', 'Club', 'manager', 'grief', 'not', 'having', 'day', 'off', 'so', 'when', 'are', 'suppose', 'catch', 'flight', 'LA', 'miss', 'thier', 'flight', 'S', 'Club', 'manager', 'giving', 'time', 'off', 'Much', 'dissmay', 'manager', 'was', 'actual', 'kidnapped', 'cloned', 'S', 'Club', 'When', 'see', 'tv', 'Live', 'LA', 'when', 'really', 'are', 'still', 'Spain', 'know', 'something', 'wrong', 'Still', 'left', 'hotel', 'bill', 'band', 'sneak', 'hotel', 'get', 'LA', 'get', 'thrown', 'jail', 'not', 'paying', 'hotel', 'bill', 'finally', 'get', 'LA', 'few', 'setbacks', 'kidnap', '3', 'clones', 'S', 'Club', 'clones', 'end', 'up', 'working', 'together', 'get', 'evil', 'scientist', 'thrown', 'jail', 'then', 'S', 'Club', 'clones', 'get', 'back', 'promoting', 'album', 'LA.This', 'dvd', 'way', 'better', 'Spice', 'World', 'better', 'story', 'line', 'dvd', 'great', 'bonus', 'features', 'great', 'music', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'yet', 'be', 'sure', 'go', 'rent', 'buy']",S Club - Seeing Double
769856,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B0000B1A4K,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[5, 7]","Imagine: you're locked in a room and given the task of listening to S Club's (as they later became known after a member left, only to be never heard of again), music, and write a script - without going totally doolally. You go totally doolally but write the script anyway.This is the finished product.OK, I will hold my hands up and admit I LOVED S Club 7 when I was growing. They were one of my favourite band. Even as an early 20something I still love their music. When people asked me what was the last DVD I bought was (as they often do), I managed to omit the ""S Club"" at the start of the title, and they had no idea what the film was. It didn't work as successfully the second time, and their reaction is my title to the review!Unfortunately Seeing Double has none of the brilliance that say, Spiceworld, had. Seeing Double was the final nail in the coffin of the band, as they split up not long after the release. They were probably only staying together just long to get the film out, and get a few royalties from it. It has no celebrity cameos (unlike Spiceworld, where they was a different celebrity cameo in every other scene), the only ""celebrity"" cameo being the band themselves, and Gareth Gates. I know, exactly who?! It's also a stereotypical storyline, and nothing really exciting happens, and they just aren't actors. (Looking back on it, they were barely singers.)S Club originally started out in a TV show, which was better, as you can take them in small doses, and I loved the TV show too. Wish I could get my hands on a DVD of that. I'd probably be the only person who would buy it mind you.Seeing Double and probably Spiceworld show why exactly bands should stick to what they're good, and get up on a stage and mime. The dialogue is terrible, and they look so mad saying it, the acting is really weak, the jokes are unbelievably bad, and NOT funny.Paul the one who left to start a rock band and was never to be heard from again, was probably glad he left when he did. The only one with sense there! And just as S Club were about to split up, S Club Juniors came along, a bunch of preteens pretending to be grown up. When am I going to grow up and start liking proper music?!",3,Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
