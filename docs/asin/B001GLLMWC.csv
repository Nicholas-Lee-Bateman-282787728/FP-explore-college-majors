1197684,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B001GLLMWC,Kate McMurry,"[4, 4]","Twenty-something Kimberly is as different as night and day from her identical-twin sister Domenique (both parts played by Andrea Roth). Kimberly is a dedicated scholar working on her Ph.D. in art history, and Domenique is a successful model based in Paris. Kimberly hasn't seen her sister in years when she suddenly shows up on Kimberly's doorstep in the U.S. It is obvious Domenique has a major drinking problem, but she has been unable to check herself into a rehab facility for fear her career will tank in the ultra-competitive world of modeling while she is out of commission for 28 days. When Kimberly expresses concern and states she wishes she could help her sister, it suddenly occurs to Domenique that with a bit of fashion and grooming help, Kimberly could be a dead ringer for her and actually take her place in Paris for a few weeks while she gets medical help. Though Kimberly protests strongly at first, it is clear that her sister's very survival is at stake and she ultimately gives in.Life as a model is far more challenging than Kimberly could have imagined, but what truly takes her by surprise is the powerful attraction she feels toward Philippe (Rick Springfield), the co-owner of the famous fashion house where Domenique is scheduled to participate in a huge, glitzy fashion show--in spite of the fact that it's no fun to be on the receiving end of the disdain that the handsome and sophisticated Philippe clearly feels for Domenique. On Philippe's side, he is amazed to discover that the flighty Domenique he's previously viewed as a drunken mess has amazing depths he never previously suspected.For fans of Rick Springfield as a talented actor, this movie will be a treat. But fans of Rick as a singer may be disappointed that he doesn't sing, as he did for the fun movie,Hard to Hold, filmed 10 years before this one at the height of his fame as a rocker. This movie isn't a romantic comedy either, as is HTH, but it is a pleasant, light drama for those who want to spend a relaxing hour and a half enjoying the interaction of two attractive, appealing romantic leads and the exciting sights and sounds of Paris.For those who read Harlequin Romance novels, you will notice that there is not nearly as much emphasis on the romance as is the case in the novel the film is based on. The focus in the movie is much more on the relationship of the two sisters initially, and later on the ""fish out of water"" tale of Kimberly dealing with the various messes her alcoholic sister has gotten herself into prior to Kimberly taking over Domenique's life. The romance doesn't get warmed up until well into the film. But Rick does a good job as the male romantic lead once it begins.",3,A switched-twins light romantic drama set in beautiful Paris,1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,2698,"['Twenty-something', 'Kimberly', 'as', 'different', 'night', 'day', 'identical-twin', 'sister', 'Domenique', 'parts', 'played', 'Andrea', 'Roth', 'Kimberly', 'dedicated', 'scholar', 'working', 'Ph.D.', 'art', 'history', 'Domenique', 'successful', 'model', 'based', 'Paris', 'Kimberly', ""n't"", 'seen', 'sister', 'years', 'when', 'suddenly', 'up', 'Kimberly', 'doorstep', 'U.S', 'obvious', 'Domenique', 'major', 'drinking', 'problem', 'been', 'unable', 'check', 'rehab', 'facility', 'fear', 'career', 'will', 'tank', 'ultra-competitive', 'world', 'modeling', 'commission', '28', 'days', 'When', 'Kimberly', 'concern', 'could', 'help', 'sister', 'suddenly', 'Domenique', 'bit', 'fashion', 'grooming', 'help', 'Kimberly', 'could', 'be', 'dead', 'ringer', 'actually', 'take', 'place', 'Paris', 'few', 'weeks', 'medical', 'help', 'Kimberly', 'protests', 'strongly', 'first', 'clear', 'sister', 'very', 'survival', 'stake', 'ultimately', 'in.Life', 'model', 'far', 'more', 'challenging', 'Kimberly', 'could', 'have', 'imagined', 'what', 'truly', 'surprise', 'powerful', 'attraction', 'Philippe', 'Rick', 'Springfield', 'co-owner', 'famous', 'fashion', 'house', 'where', 'Domenique', 'scheduled', 'participate', 'huge', 'glitzy', 'fashion', 'show', 'spite', 'fact', 'fun', 'be', 'receiving', 'end', 'disdain', 'handsome', 'sophisticated', 'Philippe', 'clearly', 'feels', 'Domenique', 'Philippe', 'side', 'amazed', 'discover', 'flighty', 'Domenique', 'previously', 'viewed', 'drunken', 'mess', 'amazing', 'depths', 'never', 'previously', 'suspected.For', 'fans', 'Rick', 'Springfield', 'talented', 'actor', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'treat', 'fans', 'Rick', 'singer', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', ""n't"", 'sing', 'did', 'fun', 'movie', 'Hard', 'Hold', 'filmed', '10', 'years', 'one', 'height', 'fame', 'rocker', 'movie', ""n't"", 'romantic', 'comedy', 'either', 'HTH', 'pleasant', 'light', 'drama', 'who', 'want', 'spend', 'relaxing', 'hour', 'half', 'enjoying', 'interaction', 'two', 'attractive', 'appealing', 'romantic', 'leads', 'exciting', 'sights', 'sounds', 'Paris.For', 'who', 'read', 'Harlequin', 'Romance', 'novels', 'will', 'notice', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'emphasis', 'romance', 'case', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'focus', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'relationship', 'two', 'sisters', 'initially', 'later', 'fish', 'water', 'tale', 'Kimberly', 'dealing', 'various', 'alcoholic', 'sister', 'gotten', 'prior', 'Kimberly', 'taking', 'over', 'Domenique', 'life', 'romance', ""n't"", 'get', 'warmed', 'up', 'well', 'film', 'Rick', 'good', 'job', 'male', 'romantic', 'lead']",Harlequin: A Change of Place

If your looking for a ""take me away"" movie and one you want to watch over and over this is it!!!!  At least in my opinion.  Nothing like a Harlequin movie.
