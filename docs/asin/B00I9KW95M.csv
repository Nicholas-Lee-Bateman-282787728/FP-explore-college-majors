1693779,ANYDQIA5YVBMM,B00I9KW95M,Alan Ramirez,"[0, 0]","Bates Motel was one of my favorite shows of last season. So I was really anxious for season 2, and it was worth all the wait. This time, we see a deeper, crazier side of the Bates family and they do it perfectly. There's mystery, drama, love, a little bit of crazy incest, and everything that was present last season; the performances of the whole cast were great, especially, of course, Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore.The story is so well told in only ten episodes, and every episode is entertaining, you want more every week. My favorite plot from this season was, of course, Miss Watson's murder mystery. With this, we get to see that Norman is slowly becoming the Psycho we first met in the 1960 film. Freddie deserved an Emmy nomination this year, he was brilliant.But I feel that quality declined a little bit. The season starts with a bang, and then it gets a little bit boring, and then entertaining again. Some plots weren't that interesting and they were really slow, like Dylan's troubles with the drug dealers, I felt like he deserves new plots that didn't involved drugs. Also, Emma wasn't as important as she was on season one, she's my favorite character, and I felt that she was ignored for more than half of the season, which is sad, because Olivia Cooke is really talented, but I hope there's something big for Emma in season 3. There's not consistency this season, but it's still enjoyable.But overall, this was a solid second season, but season one was better. It still keeps you at the edge of your seat, and I can't wait for season 3!",4,A solid second season,1405468800,"07 16, 2014",2014,1559,"['Bates', 'Motel', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'really', 'anxious', 'season', '2', 'was', 'worth', 'wait', 'time', 'see', 'deeper', 'crazier', 'side', 'Bates', 'family', 'do', 'perfectly', 'mystery', 'drama', 'love', 'little', 'bit', 'crazy', 'incest', 'everything', 'was', 'present', 'last', 'season', 'performances', 'whole', 'cast', 'were', 'great', 'especially', 'course', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'Freddie', 'Highmore.The', 'story', 'so', 'well', 'told', 'only', 'ten', 'episodes', 'episode', 'entertaining', 'want', 'more', 'week', 'favorite', 'plot', 'season', 'was', 'course', 'Miss', 'Watson', 'murder', 'mystery', 'get', 'see', 'Norman', 'slowly', 'becoming', 'Psycho', 'first', 'met', '1960', 'film', 'Freddie', 'deserved', 'Emmy', 'nomination', 'year', 'was', 'brilliant.But', 'feel', 'quality', 'declined', 'little', 'bit', 'season', 'bang', 'then', 'little', 'bit', 'boring', 'then', 'entertaining', 'again', 'plots', 'were', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'were', 'really', 'slow', 'Dylan', 'troubles', 'drug', 'dealers', 'felt', 'new', 'plots', 'did', ""n't"", 'involved', 'drugs', 'Also', 'Emma', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'important', 'was', 'season', 'one', 'favorite', 'character', 'felt', 'was', 'ignored', 'more', 'half', 'season', 'sad', 'Olivia', 'Cooke', 'really', 'talented', 'hope', 'something', 'big', 'Emma', 'season', '3', 'not', 'consistency', 'season', 'still', 'enjoyable.But', 'overall', 'was', 'solid', 'second', 'season', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'better', 'still', 'edge', 'seat', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', '3']",N/A

1693781,AI46E73DWKD2B,B00I9KW95M,BackToGood,"[7, 7]","BATES MOTEL SEASON 2 (2014) immediately picks up from the freshman Season 1 finale of Miss Watson's murder with her funeral in the season-opener, then jumps forward 4 months later to the beginning of summer, when all of Season 2 takes place. Business is booming at the Bates Motel, as Norma Bates (brilliantly brought to life by Vera Farmiga, who hopefully gets her overdue Emmy that she should have won for Season 1!) is gleefully bouncing around running her little roadside motel and living the good life with her #1 son Norman (superbly essayed by young phenom Freddie Highmore, more on him later) and her estranged son Dylan (played with understated excellence by Max Thierot). Also on board is Emma DeCody (winningly played by the refreshing Olivia Cooke), who helps Norma and Norman run the motel, and Sheriff Alex Romero (exquisitely performed by Nestor Carbonell), who is trying to keep peace in the not-so-sleepy town of White Pine Bay, Oregon. These 5 major characters return from Season 1 and continue to help shape this amazing series!A very early subplot of Season 2 involves Bradley Martin (admirably reprised by Nicola Peltz), who is suicidal over her father's brutal death back in Season 1. Bradley exacts revenge against the person she deems responsible (drug leader Gil) and then Norman and Dylan must work together to bail her out. Bradley's actions in the first episode sets the stage for Season 2's major drug-war subplot and introduces several new characters to the fray. Enter Zane Carpenter (played with sleazy, slick glee by Michael Eklund) who takes over as Dylan and Remo's boss. Special mention should also go to Ian Tracey as Remo, a minor character introduced in Season 1, who returns to help keep stability to the show. Zane is a hothead, a Sonny Corleone type who believes in ""an eye for an eye"", so he kills one of the goons who worked for the rival mysterious local drug lord Nick Ford (played with calculating menace by reliable veteran Michael O'Neill). Turns out that Ford is Miss Watson's estranged father and he pressures Romero to make an arrest, which he does early on, but Romero is not totally convinced that he's arrested the right man. Ford also makes friends with Norma at a dinner party they were both invited to by Norma's new friend Christine (well-played by Rebecca Creskoff) and her brother George (underplayed by Michael Vartan of ""Alias"" fame). Ford arranges for Norma to get a seat on the city council, but wants something in return. As Norma becomes more and more embroiled in the seedy underpinnings of the town, she begins to realize that she's out of her league. Meanwhile, Norman makes a new friend Cody Brennan (refreshingly played by Paloma Kwiatkowski), a rebellious joint-smoking, boozing, tattoo-laden outsider girl with an abusive father, but a sort of odd kindred spirit with Norman. Another early subplot involves Norma's brother Caleb (played by Kenny Johnson in the best guest performance of Season 2), which eventually compels Dylan to move out and separate himself from his creepy family. Finally, a very important running storyline involves the subtle, budding relationship between Norma Bates and Alex Romero, with stellar, close-to-the-vest acting by both Farmiga and Carbonell. After a series of very tenuous, strained interactions in Season 1, Norma and Alex find themselves unwittingly drawn closer to each other through their surprisingly in-common force-of-nature personalities and deep feelings for what they believe in.Season 2 has a lot going on, but the MAIN draw in the entire season for me is Norman's deeper descent into psychosis, and THIS is where further discussion of Freddie Highmore comes in! As good as he was in Season 1, it only touched the surface of what Norman Bates was, mostly focusing on him being mainly an awkward, gangly teenager with rare bouts of psychotic breaks. But Season 2 really ups the ante as Norman begins to lose control more and more with more frequent breaks. An early brilliant sequence involves Norman confronting Caleb on what he did to Norma when they were teenagers. Later episodes show that Norman is becoming more take-charge, independent and defiant against Norma, whereas in Season 1 he was mostly subservient to her. As Norma sees she is losing control of her son, she starts to unravel and shirk her other responsibilities and it becomes painfully apparent that she can't live without him. In my humble opinion, Freddie Highmore completely deserves an EMMY for bringing to life again this iconic character of Norman Bates. It was like watching him become Anthony Perkins before our very eyes! The dynamic between Highmore and Farmiga as Norman and ""Mother"" is one of the most fascinating relationships ever put to celluloid. If they give the Emmys to any other actors based on these two people's work in Season 2, I will demand a recount!",5,"SEASON 2 different, and in a very important way, better than SEASON

However, coming up to S2, my interest is being tested with all the Norma stuff and the various subplots.SPOILERS***************************For one thing, Norman is already 17 or 18 years old and has absolutely zero motive to kill his mother. There might have been some over Bradley, but Bradley is gone. I think the setup has been established that: 1) Norman has blackouts 2) Norman's mother is beyond messed up herself and jumps from killing someone to forgetting it in some kitschy way like she really believes it is 1958 at her house 3) Norman according to &#34;Psycho&#34;, killed his mother and her (sheriff) lover fairly early on and spent ten years in an asylum for it. They aren't leaving much time for this to develop either.As much as I love Farmiga as an actress, her soap-opera goings on are wearing thin. She has already established just how far Norma will go and what kind of mother she is. We know how she's affecting her son. And that he has inherited whatever sociopath tendencies she has. I don't mind the comedy either because let's face it, some of Norman's mother's lines in Psycho were pretty funny. But I just feel like there's too much about her and not much about Norman on the show these days. Maybe that is to show how dominating she is, but we get it already that's she's running (and ruining) his whole life.It's time for Norman to make a big move.

This season we get a sneak peak, a quick glimpse, as to what's to come (think Psycho movies).  We see him manipulate.  We see him protect what he loves.  We see him unable to cope and subsequently find a strategy to cope.2.)  What's up with these 10 episode seasons?  That needs to stop, but I'm glad this season had a lot going on in it.3.)  These actors are high rate.  Norma's mousy voice, whines, and constant crying and worrying are believable.  Norman, totally believable.  Max is believable, trying to find his place in this family.  The sheriff who makes the evidence fits into what he wants, totally believable.4.)  This season does not disappoint and is full of drama, plot twists, and emotional roller coasters.5.)  Is it just me, or does Sheriff Romero look a lot like Anthony Perkins?  CREEPY!!!  Was this done on purpose?6.)

Corn ""reviewer""","[6, 8]","Please note: this review may contain spoilers although I've tried to avoid that by focusing on how the characters and series have evolved since Season 1 -rather than spilling details of the most suspenseful moments.After watching the first season in one fell swoop (was snowed in), I became completely hooked by this series and had my calendar marked for the start of the next season. It wasn't a disappointment for me but not quite as spellbinding as I'd hoped. But  hey...it's early on.Possible spoiler alert: I  really liked the fact that Bradley, the young woman who has lost none of her appeal for Norman, had a more prominent role  -- especially in the opening shocker scene. She's grown into a darker, more disillusioned person, still deeply grieving her father. She's more tormentedSo while  the opening episode still lagged in some places for me, it also had some very fine moments, including humorous touches to offset the darker sections. Even so, I felt there was less bite, less edginess in this opening plot line. But I'm still trusting this series to regain its stride as it goes along and to tie up some loose ends from the Season 1 closing.Abother possible spoiler: I wasn't particularly impressed with the new and (for now) softer version of Norman's mother. She seems less edgy, especially with her new hairstyle and tendency to wear business suits. Luckily, she hasn't lost any of her explosive anger, a fury which can be directed at nearly anyone who refuses to listen to her or frustrates her ambitions.Freddie Highmore remains amazingly believable as the teenaged  Norman Bates  (the adult version was played by Anthony Perkins in Psycho). Highmore has the mild, self effacing manner and gentle smile that is eerily similar to Perkin's grin. It is uncanny.As noted above, in this episode there are some humorous and light moments in between the creepy ones. Spoiler alert: Norman's mother gives him driving lessons and seems as stressed as any parent advising an inexperienced teenager behind the wheel .When she trades places with Norman and gets behind the wheel herself, he teases her about her driving skills. Will he continue to push the boundaries or will she undermine him yet again?The humorous touches don't eliminate the tension and drama between mother and son.  Norman still resents her attempts to control his every move. He still wavers between his desire for freedom and his dependence on his her. He still turns to her for advice and she has a knack for getting him to open up, especially when he feels most vulnerable.Plenty of questions remain unresolved by the end of this episode, maintaining enough suspense to make me eager for the next one. What's behind Norman's memory lapses? What additional secrets from Norman's past  will be revealed? Which of the townspeople are dangerous and which are trustworthy? These -and other- mysteries are intriguing enough to keep me eagerly anticipating next week's episode.",4,Still riveting...and creepy as ever,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,2955,"['Please', 'note', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'avoid', 'focusing', 'how', 'characters', 'series', 'have', 'evolved', 'Season', '1', '-rather', 'spilling', 'details', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'moments.After', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'one', 'fell', 'swoop', 'was', 'snowed', 'became', 'completely', 'hooked', 'series', 'had', 'calendar', 'marked', 'start', 'next', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointment', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'spellbinding', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'hey', 'early', 'on.Possible', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'really', 'liked', 'fact', 'Bradley', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'lost', 'none', 'appeal', 'Norman', 'had', 'more', 'prominent', 'role', 'especially', 'opening', 'shocker', 'scene', 'grown', 'darker', 'more', 'disillusioned', 'person', 'still', 'deeply', 'grieving', 'father', 'more', 'tormentedSo', 'opening', 'episode', 'still', 'lagged', 'places', 'also', 'had', 'very', 'fine', 'moments', 'including', 'humorous', 'touches', 'offset', 'darker', 'sections', 'Even', 'so', 'felt', 'was', 'less', 'bite', 'less', 'edginess', 'opening', 'plot', 'line', ""'m"", 'still', 'trusting', 'series', 'regain', 'stride', 'along', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'Season', '1', 'closing.Abother', 'possible', 'spoiler', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'impressed', 'new', 'now', 'softer', 'version', 'Norman', 'mother', 'less', 'edgy', 'especially', 'new', 'hairstyle', 'tendency', 'wear', 'business', 'suits', 'Luckily', ""n't"", 'lost', 'explosive', 'anger', 'fury', 'can', 'be', 'directed', 'nearly', 'anyone', 'who', 'listen', 'ambitions.Freddie', 'Highmore', 'amazingly', 'believable', 'teenaged', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'adult', 'version', 'was', 'played', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'Psycho', 'Highmore', 'mild', 'effacing', 'manner', 'gentle', 'smile', 'eerily', 'similar', 'Perkin', 'grin', 'uncanny.As', 'noted', 'episode', 'are', 'humorous', 'light', 'moments', 'creepy', 'ones', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'Norman', 'mother', 'driving', 'lessons', 'as', 'stressed', 'parent', 'advising', 'inexperienced', 'teenager', 'wheel', 'places', 'Norman', 'wheel', 'driving', 'skills', 'Will', 'continue', 'push', 'boundaries', 'will', 'undermine', 'yet', 'again', 'humorous', 'touches', 'do', ""n't"", 'eliminate', 'tension', 'drama', 'mother', 'son', 'Norman', 'still', 'attempts', 'control', 'move', 'still', 'desire', 'freedom', 'dependence', 'her', 'still', 'advice', 'knack', 'getting', 'open', 'up', 'especially', 'when', 'most', 'vulnerable.Plenty', 'questions', 'remain', 'unresolved', 'end', 'episode', 'maintaining', 'enough', 'suspense', 'make', 'eager', 'next', 'one', 'What', 'Norman', 'memory', 'lapses', 'What', 'additional', 'secrets', 'Norman', 'past', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'Which', 'townspeople', 'are', 'dangerous', 'are', 'trustworthy', '-and', 'other-', 'mysteries', 'are', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'keep', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'next', 'week', 'episode']",N/A

The reason for these choices are that both concepts that are already alarmingly consistent and tense and continue to build tension and intrigue in their sophomore seasons. 24's second season showed Jack caught in a decidedly sadistic terrorist plot by mistake and enduring torture and heightening intensity until the season ended on an explosive climax. The X-Files showed our agents getting more terrifying, strange, unusually and psychologically compelling cases such as ""The Calusari"" and the episode that is without a doubt the gold standard for the series, ""Anasazi"". Moving on, second season syndrome seems to be as dormant as ever nowadays and particularly disappointing cases are ""Heroes"" and ""American Horror Story"". But it's easy to understand why: the first season seems to be awesome because it set everything in place, and season 2 tries to up it by trying way too hard.Disappointingly, Bates Motel is a show that could have, and really should have avoided this. Maybe it shouldn't have been such a hit in the first place, but looking at the first season: it was edgy, it was fast paced, it was true to the movie's psychological nature and featured a stellar performance from Freddie Highmore, who hit all the right notes while giving his own spin on Norman Bates, with Vera Farminga proving to us she could play a psycho mum really well. And the show managed to do all of this while remaining relatively simple. Murder plot, interesting subplot about a tortured girl, and the underlying theme of Norman's deteriorating mental state thanks largely to his mother.And what do we get with season 2? Well, a lot of things. Too many things. We get several love triangles, all of which are uninteresting. We watch an important character from season 1 get killed off stupidly early in the season and in comes this uninteresting girl named Cody, who is essentially just a more rebellious and snooty Bradley (and she's extremely boring too- at no point did I care if she died or just went away). Emma has some guy she takes a fancy to, and this is largely ignored, but when it's brought up, it's treated like the most important plot in the show. Then we get Norma's subplot with the bypass and her love for men in the town council. Then we get a drug farming subplot that seems like a bad first draft for Breaking Bad. Then we get Norman killing a guy in self defense and it's immediately brushed off like a little indiscretion. Then we get Norman having blackouts. Then we get the resolution to the principal's murder from season 1 (but it comes off as lazy and last minute). Then we get... by now you get it. Or you don't. But it's alright if you don't, because it's not like any of these are particularly interesting.Not helping matters is that this season is only TEN EPISODES LONG, like season one. Clearly this format is proving to be a writing problem for the show. Ten episodes is enough for a show like Game of Thrones because each season is based on a book from the series and each episode is a full hour, exploring Westeros. But here, these writers are apparently so happy about the success of their beloved Bates Motel that they feel more is better. Sometimes it can be, like the aforementioned 24 second season. But look at how last minute the marijuana farming subplot is. And why is there so much focus on Norma? What about Norman's blackouts? I'm sure this will be explained in season 3, but here it just feels like lazy writing all around.I'll watch season 3, because like I mentioned, bad second seasons are pretty much a standard for TV nowadays. I get that not every show can be Hannibal nowadays. But that can't mean that it can't be good. Though considering how many movies there were in the Psycho franchise, maybe bringing in elements from the sequels could help to explain the convoluted plots and back stories here, but if not, then it'll be even more clear that this show is a victim of its own success.",2,Drunk on success,1405468800,"07 16, 2014",2014,4179,"['Second', 'seasons', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'impossible', 'get', 'right', 'nowadays', 'Scratch', 'actually', 'second', 'seasons', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'hard', 'get', 'right', 'now', 'then', 'are', 'exceptions', 'two', 'stand', 'out', 'mind', 'are', 'X-Files', '24', 'reason', 'choices', 'are', 'concepts', 'are', 'already', 'alarmingly', 'consistent', 'tense', 'continue', 'build', 'tension', 'intrigue', 'sophomore', 'seasons', '24', 'second', 'season', 'showed', 'Jack', 'caught', 'decidedly', 'sadistic', 'terrorist', 'plot', 'mistake', 'enduring', 'torture', 'heightening', 'intensity', 'season', 'ended', 'explosive', 'climax', 'X-Files', 'showed', 'agents', 'getting', 'more', 'terrifying', 'strange', 'unusually', 'psychologically', 'compelling', 'cases', 'such', 'Calusari', 'episode', 'doubt', 'gold', 'standard', 'series', 'Anasazi', 'Moving', 'second', 'season', 'syndrome', 'be', 'as', 'dormant', 'ever', 'nowadays', 'particularly', 'disappointing', 'cases', 'are', 'Heroes', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'first', 'season', 'be', 'awesome', 'set', 'everything', 'place', 'season', '2', 'tries', 'trying', 'way', 'too', 'hard.Disappointingly', 'Bates', 'Motel', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'avoided', 'Maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'hit', 'first', 'place', 'looking', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'edgy', 'was', 'fast', 'paced', 'was', 'true', 'movie', 'psychological', 'nature', 'featured', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'who', 'hit', 'right', 'notes', 'giving', 'own', 'spin', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'Vera', 'Farminga', 'proving', 'could', 'play', 'psycho', 'mum', 'really', 'well', 'show', 'managed', 'do', 'remaining', 'relatively', 'simple', 'Murder', 'plot', 'interesting', 'subplot', 'tortured', 'girl', 'underlying', 'theme', 'Norman', 'deteriorating', 'mental', 'state', 'thanks', 'largely', 'mother.And', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'season', '2', 'Well', 'lot', 'things', 'Too', 'many', 'things', 'get', 'several', 'love', 'triangles', 'are', 'uninteresting', 'watch', 'important', 'character', 'season', '1', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'stupidly', 'early', 'season', 'uninteresting', 'girl', 'named', 'Cody', 'who', 'essentially', 'just', 'more', 'rebellious', 'snooty', 'Bradley', 'extremely', 'boring', 'too-', 'point', 'did', 'care', 'died', 'just', 'went', 'away', 'Emma', 'guy', 'fancy', 'largely', 'ignored', 'when', 'brought', 'up', 'treated', 'most', 'important', 'plot', 'show', 'Then', 'get', 'Norma', 'subplot', 'bypass', 'love', 'men', 'town', 'council', 'Then', 'get', 'drug', 'farming', 'subplot', 'bad', 'first', 'draft', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Then', 'get', 'Norman', 'killing', 'guy', 'self', 'defense', 'immediately', 'brushed', 'off', 'little', 'indiscretion', 'Then', 'get', 'Norman', 'having', 'blackouts', 'Then', 'get', 'resolution', 'principal', 'murder', 'season', '1', 'off', 'lazy', 'last', 'minute', 'Then', 'get', 'now', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'alright', 'do', ""n't"", 'not', 'are', 'particularly', 'interesting.Not', 'helping', 'matters', 'season', 'only', 'TEN', 'EPISODES', 'LONG', 'season', 'one', 'Clearly', 'format', 'proving', 'be', 'writing', 'problem', 'show', 'Ten', 'episodes', 'enough', 'show', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'season', 'based', 'book', 'series', 'episode', 'full', 'hour', 'exploring', 'Westeros', 'here', 'writers', 'are', 'apparently', 'so', 'happy', 'success', 'beloved', 'Bates', 'Motel', 'feel', 'more', 'better', 'can', 'be', 'aforementioned', '24', 'second', 'season', 'look', 'how', 'last', 'minute', 'marijuana', 'farming', 'subplot', 'why', 'there', 'so', 'much', 'focus', 'Norma', 'What', 'Norman', 'blackouts', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'explained', 'season', '3', 'here', 'just', 'feels', 'lazy', 'writing', 'around.I', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'season', '3', 'mentioned', 'bad', 'second', 'seasons', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'TV', 'nowadays', 'get', 'not', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'Hannibal', 'nowadays', 'ca', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'considering', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'were', 'Psycho', 'franchise', 'maybe', 'bringing', 'elements', 'sequels', 'could', 'help', 'explain', 'convoluted', 'plots', 'back', 'stories', 'here', 'not', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'even', 'more', 'clear', 'show', 'victim', 'own', 'success']",N/A

His over possessive mother is also a bit of a Jekyll and Hide shrew. She can be clinging and needy one moment and then screaming and obnoxious the next. What Norma does to her son is too pathetic to be a crime but unforgivable. Now his black outs have increased and he sees his mother when she isn't there and even becomes her. We have all seen the movie and grit our teeth as we see Norman heading down the road to insanity. It is cool and definitely cannot be an accident that the actor portraying Sheriff Romero bears an uncanny resemblance to the older Tony Perkins. The story development is intense. I find myself hoping against the certain knowledge of the outcome that somehow things could turn out differently for poor Norman.

1693829,AP3B615GM191G,B00I9KW95M,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","In the first season of Bates Motel, the show focused about 75% on &#34;White Pine Bay&#34; stuff (Dylan, pot fields, chasing oriental girls, etc.) and 25% on Norma/Norman &#34;Psycho canon&#34; material.  As a viewer who came into the show wanting to see the evolution of Norman Bates into the Anthony Perkins character, I was disappointed by that formula.  For the second season, however, the show creators pretty much flipped that formula, now focusing on 75% &#34;canon&#34; and 25% &#34;White Pine Bay&#34;.  For me, that made all the difference!From the very beginning of this season, it became very clear to me that this was a show with a refined purpose.  Some of the highlights (minor spoilers) of the season included...-Much further exploration of Norman's (Freddie Highmore) &#34;blackouts&#34;.-Norma's (Vera Farmiga) brother Caleb shows up with conflicting stories about their childhood together.-With Bradley (Nicola Peltz) gone for most of the season (likely to film her role in &#34;Transformers 4&#34;), new character Cody Brennan (Paloma Kwiatkowski) fills in quite nicely.  Her character really exposes the holes in the Norma/Norman relationship.-Even though the drug war takes somewhat of a back seat this season, not over-exposing it actually makes for some pretty interesting stuff going on between Dylan (Max Theirot), Romero (Nestor Carbonell), and Nick Ford (Michael O'Neill).-Finally, just when you think &#34;where can they go next?&#34;, the writers hit you with a whammy regarding further investigation into the death of Blair Watson.My only &#34;complaint&#34; about this season?  Emma Decody (Olivia Cooke) is hardly used at all (or at least nowhere near her potential).  She is in every episode, but her character arc is non-existent.  With the news that the show will be back for at least a third season, I hope that the writers give her something more interesting to do in Season Three.  She deserves it.Overall, then, this Second Season of &#34;Bates Motel&#34; saved my interest in the show, turning it from a chore (end of first season) to maybe the most anticipated &#34;TV hour&#34; of the week!  With every episode, I saw a continued transformation of Highmore's Norman into the classic Perkins portrayal (which is what I ultimately want from this show).  I look forward for what the next batch of episodes have to offer, as I'm charged up about anything &#34;Bates&#34; once again!",5,Formula Flip Gave Me What I Wanted To See,1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,2421,"['first', 'season', 'Bates', 'Motel', 'show', 'focused', 'about', '75', '%', '34', 'White', 'Pine', 'Bay', '34', 'stuff', 'Dylan', 'pot', 'fields', 'chasing', 'oriental', 'girls', 'etc', '25', '%', 'Norma/Norman', '34', 'Psycho', 'canon', '34', 'material', 'viewer', 'who', 'came', 'show', 'wanting', 'see', 'evolution', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'character', 'was', 'disappointed', 'formula', 'second', 'season', 'however', 'show', 'pretty', 'much', 'flipped', 'formula', 'now', 'focusing', '75', '%', '34', 'canon', '34', '25', '%', '34', 'White', 'Pine', 'Bay', '34', 'made', 'difference', 'very', 'beginning', 'season', 'became', 'very', 'clear', 'was', 'show', 'refined', 'purpose', 'highlights', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'season', 'included', '-Much', 'further', 'exploration', 'Norman', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', '34', 'blackouts', '34', '.-Norma', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'brother', 'Caleb', 'up', 'conflicting', 'stories', 'childhood', 'together.-With', 'Bradley', 'Nicola', 'Peltz', 'gone', 'most', 'season', 'likely', 'film', 'role', '34', 'Transformers', '4', '34', 'new', 'character', 'Cody', 'Brennan', 'Paloma', 'Kwiatkowski', 'quite', 'nicely', 'character', 'really', 'holes', 'Norma/Norman', 'relationship.-Even', 'drug', 'war', 'somewhat', 'back', 'seat', 'season', 'not', 'over-exposing', 'actually', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'going', 'Dylan', 'Max', 'Theirot', 'Romero', 'Nestor', 'Carbonell', 'Nick', 'Ford', 'Michael', ""O'Neill"", '.-Finally', 'just', 'when', 'think', '34', 'where', 'can', 'go', 'next', '34', 'writers', 'hit', 'whammy', 'regarding', 'further', 'investigation', 'death', 'Blair', 'Watson.My', 'only', '34', 'complaint', '34', 'season', 'Emma', 'Decody', 'Olivia', 'Cooke', 'hardly', 'used', 'least', 'nowhere', 'potential', 'episode', 'character', 'arc', 'non-existent', 'news', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'least', 'third', 'season', 'hope', 'writers', 'give', 'something', 'more', 'interesting', 'do', 'Season', 'Three', 'it.Overall', 'then', 'Second', 'Season', '34', 'Bates', 'Motel', '34', 'saved', 'interest', 'show', 'turning', 'chore', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'maybe', 'most', 'anticipated', '34', 'TV', 'hour', '34', 'week', 'episode', 'saw', 'continued', 'transformation', 'Highmore', 'Norman', 'classic', 'Perkins', 'portrayal', 'what', 'ultimately', 'want', 'show', 'look', 'forward', 'what', 'next', 'batch', 'episodes', 'have', 'offer', ""'m"", 'charged', 'up', 'anything', '34', 'Bates', '34', 'once', 'again']",N/A
