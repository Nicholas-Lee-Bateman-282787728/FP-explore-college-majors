40063,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,0782006752,Alex Udvary,"[6, 10]","When I first rented this movie, I did so because I thought it was a musical, please try to hold your laughter. It had a score by Noel Coward, so what was I suppose to think? Granted this cast is not a musical bunch lol, but, you never know! lol. Directed by Stanley Donnen, no doubt best known for directing &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot;, &quot;Grass Is Greener&quot; has a &quot;staged&quot; feel to it. The acting is good, after all, look at this cast. How could it not be great! But, the story leaves something to be desired, mainly just a hint of realism. I understand this is suppose to be a sweet romantic story, that is probably suppose to be anything but real, but just a hint of realism could of make this work. C'mon lets be honest. What man would react to the same situation Grant finds himself in? You see his wife Deborah Kerr runs off with Robert Mitchum. And Grant is perfectly understanding. He never makes an attempt to go after her. She lies to Grant and just goes with Mitchum. The one thing I hate most about movies like this is. If it was a man that ran off with another women, no one would find it romantic. Women would bash him for what he did. But, when a women runs away with another man, all of a sudden it's romantic. Is something wrong with this picture? You bet! This has a sloppy script, and unbelievanle characters. Redeeming moments are the use of Noel Coward's music, the acting, and Donnen's directing. If you want to see a better movie with Kerr and Grant, get &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot;.

40071,A3N95R1VKWROWF,0782006752,Christopher Schwinger,"[2, 2]","This is one classy comedy.  It has a premise which is very simple, a conflict that results when Robert Mitchum seduces Deborah Kerr away from her husband Cary Grant.  Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are an earl and his lady who have to host tours of their manor and grow mushrooms to make ends meet.  Robert Mitchum, an American millionaire, is part of a tour and seeks out Deborah Kerr, looking for a tryst.  She attempts to deceive Cary Grant that she's going to London for business when she actually is pursuing an affair with Mitchum.  Cary Grant gets both of them to come back to his manor and engages in repartee and eventually sets up a duel with Mitchum.  What this movie does, due to the writers, is send you on a delightful journey without making the affair part of the enjoyment.  Cary Grant never made a movie glorifying adultery.  The enjoyment is not the affair, but how Cary Grant responds to it, and the lighthearted tone and serious theme never felt to me like an unnatural conglomeration.  Cary Grant is strongly moral through the movie and wants Deborah Kerr back only if she wants to come back, but doesn't want to end the marriage.  His persona by this period of his career has an added dimension of maturity and willingness to wait things out instead of act recklessly, which I think makes him even more appealing than in his earlier films.  He makes the acting seem so easy as he rattles off comebacks that are incisive and hilarious.  The script is fantastic, making me enjoy the whole journey of how he gets Deborah Kerr back.  The music is funny and the supporting actors are memorable.  There's a moral underpinning to the movie about marital fidelity that makes the story funny but not disrespectful or smutty.  It's got the wit of 30s-40s romantic comedies and has a more jolly style than Billy Wilder's romantic comedies.  It has the incisiveness of more sexual comedies but with a jolliness and good philosophy of marriage.  I like Cary Grant's statements about marriage being a commitment you take as a complete package, rather than just the immediate sensual gratification, and that you shouldn't easily divorce someone for a mistake, even if that mistake is adultery.  I'm proud of the writers for fighting the trend, which was toward laughing at infidelity.  The writers were husband and wife, which I think makes the script feel breezy, like a natural relationship exists between Grant and Kerr.  Kerr had done great performances with both Grant and Mitchum soon before this movie, which also makes the character relationships feel natural.  I think all of the actors are excellent and especially enjoy seeing two of my favorite actors, Cary Grant and Robert Mitchum, interact.I conclude with a summary taken from Wikipedia's article about the play, which was turned into the movie:""J. C. Trewin includes Grass is Greener as one of the top four plays of 1958-59.  He describes Grass is Greener as the best of William's three comedies, noting its ""glancing wit"" and ""well bred ease.""  Trewin describes ""neatly constructed,"" with much of the comedy coming from ""apparent irrelevance.""""There are lots of funny jokes that seem spontaneous and effervescent.

Check out the variety of her talent, before she came to America, as Ophelia in Olivier's Hamlet, as the native girl in Black Narcissus, and as the young Estella in Great Expectations.

I'm an old movie fan and abhor the blatant fare provided today.  Some may call this hypocritical, and this film no doubt skims lightly over a very important moral issue.  However, in this case, I could just enjoy some of what I particularly enjoy from older movies -- beautiful houses, furniture, some of the English based to-do, clothes and all of that.  Old movies are particularly illusionary in providing this without the nasty realism of modern days that has a way of getting into your gut.  And please keep in mind that modern movies generally have the illicit lovers triumph, not what happens here.  The light touch is part of the appeal of the older ones.

His wife (Deborah Kerr) plays a mushroom picking wife with two children (that we never see).  One day a rich  American tourist millionaire (Robert Mitchum) and decides he loves the Earl's wife and proposes to have an affair with her.

These are old friends, witty, warm, and hilarious, in situations that are universal. This is what I would call a &#34;chamber&#34; movie, a small cast and just a couple of locations, a movie that moves at a sedate, measured pace.The performances in this movie are world-class: Cary Grant as Victor Rhyall, a traditionalist, trying to hang on to his way of life and to the wife he remains deeply in love with; Deborah Kerr as Hillary Rhyall, a woman torn between the passion of a new relationship and the comfort of the old one; Robert Mitchum as Charles Delacro, an American oil millionaire, forward, aggressive, and used to getting what he wants; and Jean Simmons as Hattie Durant, the wacky flirtatious friend of Hillary and Victor.The basic story is quite simple: Charles Delacro is on a tour of stately homes and he opens a private door to the apartments of Victory and Hillary Rhyall, where he meets Hillary. The attraction is immediate, mutual, and palpable. Hillary finds herself dazed and torn, as she, almost against her will, travels to London to meet her new lover. Her husband Victor recognizes what's going on but doesn't know how to deal with it. While Hillary is in London, her best friend (and former girlfriend of Victor) travels to visit Victor, to offer advice and comfort.The situations come to a head when the four of them come to the estate for a weekend party. Victor's ultimate solution to his dilemma is novel and I won't spoil things by revealing the solution or the eventual outcome. Suffice to say that the movie and the performances are very satisfying.I have to give a shout-out to the opening credits by Maurice Binder, by the way, which are wonderfully hilarious, with various diapered babies in appropriate poses (e.g., a picture of a baby playing with a roll of a film when giving the credit for the film's editor).",5,Somewhat dated but like visiting an old friend,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,2005,"['movie', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'now', '34', 'Hillary', 'boy', 'name', '34', 'watching', 'movie', 'slipping', 'comfortable', 'pair', 'old', 'slippers', 'are', 'old', 'friends', 'witty', 'warm', 'hilarious', 'situations', 'are', 'universal', 'what', 'would', 'call', '34', 'chamber', '34', 'movie', 'small', 'cast', 'just', 'couple', 'locations', 'movie', 'sedate', 'measured', 'pace.The', 'performances', 'movie', 'are', 'world-class', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Victor', 'Rhyall', 'traditionalist', 'trying', 'hang', 'way', 'life', 'wife', 'deeply', 'love', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'Hillary', 'Rhyall', 'woman', 'torn', 'passion', 'new', 'relationship', 'comfort', 'old', 'one', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'Charles', 'Delacro', 'American', 'oil', 'millionaire', 'forward', 'aggressive', 'used', 'getting', 'what', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Hattie', 'Durant', 'wacky', 'flirtatious', 'friend', 'Hillary', 'Victor.The', 'basic', 'story', 'quite', 'simple', 'Charles', 'Delacro', 'tour', 'stately', 'homes', 'private', 'door', 'apartments', 'Victory', 'Hillary', 'Rhyall', 'where', 'Hillary', 'attraction', 'immediate', 'mutual', 'palpable', 'Hillary', 'finds', 'dazed', 'torn', 'almost', 'will', 'travels', 'London', 'meet', 'new', 'lover', 'husband', 'Victor', 'what', 'going', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'deal', 'Hillary', 'London', 'best', 'friend', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'Victor', 'visit', 'Victor', 'offer', 'advice', 'comfort.The', 'situations', 'come', 'head', 'when', 'four', 'come', 'estate', 'weekend', 'party', 'Victor', 'ultimate', 'solution', 'dilemma', 'novel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'things', 'revealing', 'solution', 'eventual', 'outcome', 'Suffice', 'say', 'movie', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'satisfying.I', 'have', 'give', 'shout-out', 'opening', 'credits', 'Maurice', 'Binder', 'way', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'hilarious', 'various', 'diapered', 'babies', 'appropriate', 'poses', 'e.g.', 'picture', 'baby', 'playing', 'roll', 'film', 'when', 'giving', 'credit', 'film', 'editor']",The Grass Is Greener VHS

The marketing positions it as a classic ""screwball"" comedy but it hardly comes up to that standard.  If you laugh once or twice during the whole movie, you will probably be laughing at some disparaging remark made by someone sitting next to you.Employing the liberal theory of marriage that any bad behavior can be justified if a couple can talk about it openly and endlessly, this movie comes to the conclusion that infidelity is no big deal and no reason for divorce.  If you think snappy chitchat is a good substitute for intelligent dialog, you might find the script interesting.

The Earl, believe it or not, has money problems, and the HUGE and TOTALLY BEAUTIFUL mansion he live in with his wife and two children is now actually OWNED by the English ""National Trust"" - a very real organization. that has taken over many of the ""stately homes"" of England, for financial reasons.  And yet, thenoble families who once owned them, still DO continue to live in them.  (The mansion that Grant's character's family lives in is totally spectacular, and MUST be a real mansion hired out to play the movie role of Grant's fictional Earl's home.  Sadly, the NAME of this stately home is NOT given....although the EXTERIOUR is shown, along with those of neighbouring stately homes, towards the very beginning of the programme --whilst Noel Coward's song, ""The Stately Homes of England"" is played, and sung to, in the background.)  Just seeing the interiours, (as featured in the first part of the movie, ""The Museum"", is, to those who love fine architecture and furniture, worth the price of this movie!The VERY beginning, of course, features the credits.  Amusingly, we see the back of a new, sitting BABY each time a cast member is mentioned.  Why?  Because this movie is about primal humaninstincts -- instincts that are put forth readily when one is a baby, and are but barely disguised, even in adulthood.The Earl's wife, (Ms. Kerr), is, you see --even though truly happily married --attracted to the rather forceful American Millionaire, (ROBERT MICHUM), who shows up during one of the hours when other tourists are traipsing through the Earl's ancestral home.  He opens the door marked ""private"", and the mutual attraction between himself and the Earl's wife is soon obvious to both of them.  And to the audience.  And, also, to the Earl, who pops in in the last moments.Civilly, however, none of the principals actually comes off and mentions it --  at first.  But then the Earl's wife has to have her hair done.  Obviously there are no hairdressers expert enough in the country district where they live, to do the Lady's hair -- and also, just as obviously, she and the Earl do NOT have the money to bring an expert hairdresser to their mansion.  (Both the Earl and his lady grow mushrooms to sell, to make a little extra cash...)  So, it's off on a train to London, to visit a top hairdresser, to which the Lady of the manor soon goes....  Waiting for her, quite unexpectedly, is the American Millionaire, who has just before called up ALL the leading hairdressers in London, to find out at which one the object of his affections will be.  There is no train till the next day, and so American Millionaire and English Lady go to a chic restaurant, and some museums, before she must leave for home...The Lady has stayed at the home of her friend -- a chatterbox and oddball, played by JEAN SIMMONS.  Situations then go from ""pillar to post"", which many amusing situations -- and a lot of very witty repartee.  Finally, a (pistol) duel ensues, between the two male contenders for Ms. Kerr's character's affections....All in all, this is a VERY well-written, well-directed, well-acted movie.  The settings and costumes are gorgeous, (Hardie Ames, and Norman Hartnell -- also designers of Quen Elizabeth II's gowns and suits -- designed the ladie's costumes.  The dialogue is quick, funny, literate. VEDDY British, amusing and witty.  This is admittedly can be called an ""old-fashioned"" movie, for ""old fashioned"" people who LIKE lovely costumes and settings, and LIKE movies WITHOUT four-letter words or rock music, (or even it's 1960s equivalent, Beatnick music).  Yet the idea of a happily-married woman being attracted to a handsome stranger is....well, NOT so very old-fashioned!  This is an EXTREMELY cultured and civilized movie -- but it does, well, ""wink"" a bit.  All ends happily, of course...............................................................P.S. A SAD, REAL SIDELIGHT.......Stanley Donen, who directed this movie, once had a romance with the very young, and then as-yet-unmarried Elizabeth Taylor.

40095,A39IY0JU5JI69G,0782006752,"Promise ""promise""","[6, 9]","Cary Grant almost makes this terrible film worth seeing. He manages to bring his style and class, not to mention his very good looks, to this role of a befuddled English earl who is fighting to keep his wife.  The wife is played by the wonderful Deborah Kerr but she is terribly miscast.  Ms. Kerr reeks of integrity and intelligence and cannot convince the audience that she could possible be silly enough to fall in love with a brash American millionaire, Robert Mitchem, in ten minutes. What intelligent sensible woman could risk her happy marriage with Cary Gtant for a fling with Robert Mitchem?  Maybe he smells good or exudes theramones or something that we cannot see in this film.The whole plot rests on this flimsy occurrence, and if anyone has bothered to read the title of the film, we know how it will end up.  It might be fun to see the plot unfold, but it really isn't.  The Jean Simmons character is meant to liven up the story a little but just acts silly.  The butler, Sellars, does the best job.  But that isn't enough.  Robert Mitchem is a great film presence and I have enjoyed his performances a lot but here he's just a big rich oaf.Not only is the plot absurdly lame but the last part is terribly talky.
