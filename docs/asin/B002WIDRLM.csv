1296906,A84YM8A5TW5NW,B002WIDRLM,Danielle Bizzell,"[3, 3]","This is a really great show,its well cast and the storyline is fresh and never boring. I like how its about an african american family because lets get real you don't see too many african american family shows these days, that are a positive influence on younger kids and young adults. This show has romance, excitement, comedy, morals; its like the ""Black 7th Heaven""  but not as corny. So if your a fan of 7th heaven or the wire or just really good acting then you should check this show out.",5,I love it,1311206400,"07 21, 2011",2011,494,"['really', 'great', 'show', 'well', 'cast', 'storyline', 'fresh', 'never', 'boring', 'how', 'african', 'american', 'family', 'lets', 'get', 'real', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'too', 'many', 'african', 'american', 'family', 'days', 'are', 'positive', 'influence', 'younger', 'kids', 'young', 'adults', 'show', 'romance', 'excitement', 'comedy', 'morals', 'Black', '7th', 'Heaven', 'not', 'corny', 'So', 'fan', '7th', 'heaven', 'wire', 'just', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'then', 'should', 'check', 'show', 'out']",N/A

Just discovered &#34;Lincoln Heights&#34; and am presently streaming on Netflix (only finished at this writing); however, kept stumbling around and found the show has been cancelled. Was searching Amazon to find the availability of purchasing and only the first season is available. What a travesty first to cancel and then only be able to purchase season 1.  What's up??  You've ended one of the greatest shows on tv and still only one season available?  The network had a GREAT thing going and I was just getting involved at the end of streaming the 4th season.  Must add; however, the show left on a good note and is a plus for me.  IT HAD A GREAT ENDING.Additionally, the show should have taught others that the black experience is not a monolithic one as once portrayed on earlier television screens and oftentimes today.  We are like others who populate the world:  good people/bad people, lazy people/smart people, etc.  This should be evident to everyone because we've existed on this planet together for so long and all are mixed with each other.
