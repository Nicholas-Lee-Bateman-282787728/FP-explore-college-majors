970495,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B000E8NRBM,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[1, 7]","The spiral staircase at the Loretto Chapel in Santa Fe,New Mexico,is legendary. The nuns of Loretto needed a staircase to protect their modesty-- for a time,all seemed hopeless. Then a stranger came,made the staircase,and mysteriously vanished.  According to tradition, the man was St. Joseph himself. It turns out he was a reclusive French architect. ""The Staircase"" aims to demystify the legend,with less than mystifying results.In ""The Staircase"",the made-for-TV movie starring Barbara Hershey as the mother superior,and William Petersen (before his CSI glory days) as the enigmatic carpenter,the story becomes turgid melodrama. The mother superior is arrogant,hates the Native Americans,and curses. She's self-righteous--until the mysterious man comes into her life. He gets preachy with her about being loving&compassionate.; To make matters worse,he gets falsely arrested for murder (how CSI! Too bad the team wasn't on the case) The mother superior realizes she's dying from cancer;she better get right with God before the hereafter. In the end,the staircase is completed and she makes an agonizing (for her and the viewer) ascent up the staircase. Melodrama at its best. It's Black Narcissus set in New Mexico!""The Staircase"" isn't very inspiring. The characters are unsympathetic and one-dimensional. In ""demystifying"" the legend,it's the usual made-for-TV fare.

I'll just tell you what I like about it.What is interesting to me, is that the staircase is really there and it really was built by a mysterious stranger with technology and techniques that were rarely practiced at the the time.I don't know if it was a miracle, or just a kind man that wanted to help those in need.  Either way, it is an inspiring story.On the question whether or not it was a miracle, there is something that took place historically that doesn't appear in the movie.  The nuns had been praying to St. Joseph the carpenter for nine days.  On the ninth day, the stranger showed up and subsequently started working on the mysterious staircase.  This ""coincidence"" has caused many people to believe that the mysterious stranger was St. Joseph himself.The movie is very inspiring because, whether you believe there is a divine or saintly intervention or not, it is refreshing to see people help each other.  If there is one thing that I love to see, it is the charity and care that some people glady give to their fellow human beings.

970506,ACMPIAFRW8JM6,B000E8NRBM,Laura J. Eklund,"[0, 0]","I'm not Catholic, but I think anyone who enjoys movies of faith will like this one.The story is about a group of nuns who have traveled from Kentucky to Santa Fe, New Mexico Territory, circa 1876.  They are led by a general-like Mother Suuperiior, Mother Madelaine(Barbara Hershey).  Through hard work, she and her group are able to build a convent.  All it lacked was a chapel.  Using her forcefull personality, she is able to get a local contractor, Mr. Philger(David Clennon)to accomplish the goal. In the process of building the chapel a mistake is made wherein the stairs to the choir loft are forgotten.  Madelaine cannot get money to fix the problem so she prays for answer to her problem.  In the process of the story, a man rides out of the desert on a mule.  He claims to be a carpenter and offers to build the stairs.  The man Joad(William Petersen) and Madelaine develope a deep affection for one another as they both put their hearts into building the staircase.At the end Joad disappears into the desert in the same abrupt way he arrived.Although this story has been embelleshed by writers it is based on the true story of the ""Sisters of Our Lady of the Light"" in Sante Fe, New Mexico.Madelaine is supported by what could only be described as her conscious, Sister Margret played by Diane Ladd.Petersen played his role of Joad with sensitivity and humility as one would expect from a man of faith assiting the nuns.  Diane Ladd was given a small part in this movie, but being the professional she is, she took it and made it her own.  I loved her portrayal of Margret.  I was definitely supprised by Barbara Hershey's performance of Mother Madelaine.  I was disappointed, her performance was flat, with little genioun emotion.  She played the character as a one-sided person and even my untrained eye could tell there were more layers to the character than what she brought across.All in all, I really like this movie and do recommend it.",4,I really like this movie.,1244246400,"06 6, 2009",2009,1953,"[""'m"", 'not', 'Catholic', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'movies', 'faith', 'will', 'like', 'one.The', 'story', 'group', 'nuns', 'who', 'have', 'traveled', 'Kentucky', 'Santa', 'Fe', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Territory', 'circa', '1876', 'are', 'led', 'general-like', 'Mother', 'Suuperiior', 'Mother', 'Madelaine', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'hard', 'work', 'group', 'are', 'able', 'build', 'convent', 'lacked', 'was', 'chapel', 'Using', 'forcefull', 'personality', 'able', 'get', 'local', 'contractor', 'Mr.', 'Philger', 'David', 'Clennon', 'accomplish', 'goal', 'process', 'building', 'chapel', 'mistake', 'made', 'stairs', 'choir', 'loft', 'are', 'forgotten', 'Madelaine', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'money', 'fix', 'problem', 'answer', 'problem', 'process', 'story', 'man', 'desert', 'mule', 'be', 'carpenter', 'build', 'stairs', 'man', 'Joad', 'William', 'Petersen', 'Madelaine', 'develope', 'deep', 'affection', 'one', 'put', 'hearts', 'building', 'staircase.At', 'end', 'Joad', 'desert', 'same', 'abrupt', 'way', 'story', 'been', 'embelleshed', 'writers', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Sisters', 'Lady', 'Light', 'Sante', 'Fe', 'New', 'Mexico.Madelaine', 'supported', 'what', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'conscious', 'Sister', 'Margret', 'played', 'Diane', 'Ladd.Petersen', 'played', 'role', 'Joad', 'sensitivity', 'humility', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'man', 'faith', 'assiting', 'nuns', 'Diane', 'Ladd', 'was', 'given', 'small', 'part', 'movie', 'being', 'professional', 'took', 'made', 'own', 'loved', 'portrayal', 'Margret', 'was', 'definitely', 'supprised', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'performance', 'Mother', 'Madelaine', 'was', 'disappointed', 'performance', 'was', 'flat', 'little', 'genioun', 'emotion', 'played', 'character', 'one-sided', 'person', 'even', 'untrained', 'eye', 'could', 'tell', 'were', 'more', 'layers', 'character', 'what', 'brought', 'across.All', 'really', 'movie', 'do', 'recommend']",STAIRCASE - The Staircase

I highly recommend this movie and it should be shared with children to teach them to belive in themselves and others.",5,Excellent Movie,1265155200,"02 3, 2010",2010,716,"['story', 'Staircase', 'chior', 'loft', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'saw', 'movie', 'played', 'everything', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'Diane', 'Ladd', 'are', 'wonderful', 'leaders', 'community', 'chapel', 'only', 'problem', 'beautiful', 'stone', 'chapel', 'chior', 'loft', 'was', 'completed', 'stairs', 'where', 'man', 'beautiful', 'staircase', 'nails', 'supporting', 'columns', 'William', 'Petersen', 'part', 'beautifully', 'been', 'sent', 'god', 'answer', 'sisters', 'prayers', 'warm', 'loving', 'almost', 'spiritual', 'character', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'shared', 'children', 'teach', 'belive', 'others']",STAIRCASE - The Staircase
970513,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B000E8NRBM,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[0, 0]","This 95-minute film on a bare-bones DVD aired on CBS in 1998. It's an uplifting feel-good movie that recalls the style of Hallmark and Lifetime made-for-TV films, but &#34;The Staircase&#34; has an unexpected spiritual depth that puts it a cut above those other productions. Barbara Hershey plays an ailing Catholic mother superior whose only wish is to see the Sisters of Loretto chapel in Santa Fe completed before she dies. Diane Ladd is a sympathetic nun and William Peterson of TV's &#34;CSI&#34; is the mysterious carpenter who volunteers to build a spiral staircase after the original builders forget to provide access to the chapel's choir loft.Based on the real-life Loretto chapel, now a museum attached to a hotel in Santa Fe, this film excels at suggesting the miraculous in everyday human qualities rather than hitting the viewer over the head with special effects or heavy-handed allegory. The relationship between Hershey and Peterson, despite Hershey's inconsistent Irish accent and Peterson's sometimes too-relaxed performance, grows unexpectedly poignant as the film progresses. The human relations in this film are so perfectly observed that even a potentially melodramatic subplot gets resolved in a satisfying way before it derails the film. These are signs of unusual quality in the production.While the movie starts out on a nondescript footing, giving hints of Western cliches that recall old &#34;nuns in the Wild West&#34; films, it gradually accumulates power after Peterson finds his way into the story. Honestly, I didn't expect to be moved so deeply by this film, as the story in itself didn't suggest much in the way of originality. But you really have to see this film to believe it: It's one of the most mature, spiritually rich, and humanized portrayals of religion on film that you will ever see. It's also one of the few films where you're not entirely certain just how it will end, other than expecting the staircase to be completed. The plot is simple, but the depth of relationships are deep. I highly recommend it.",5,Hauntingly beautiful and spiritual film,1398816000,"04 30, 2014",2014,2054,"['95-minute', 'film', 'bare-bones', 'DVD', 'aired', 'CBS', '1998', 'uplifting', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'style', 'Hallmark', 'Lifetime', 'made-for-TV', 'films', '34', 'Staircase', '34', 'unexpected', 'spiritual', 'depth', 'cut', 'other', 'productions', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'ailing', 'Catholic', 'mother', 'superior', 'only', 'wish', 'see', 'Sisters', 'Loretto', 'chapel', 'Santa', 'Fe', 'completed', 'Diane', 'Ladd', 'sympathetic', 'nun', 'William', 'Peterson', 'TV', '34', 'CSI', '34', 'mysterious', 'carpenter', 'who', 'build', 'spiral', 'staircase', 'original', 'builders', 'forget', 'provide', 'access', 'chapel', 'choir', 'loft.Based', 'real-life', 'Loretto', 'chapel', 'now', 'museum', 'attached', 'hotel', 'Santa', 'Fe', 'film', 'excels', 'suggesting', 'miraculous', 'everyday', 'human', 'qualities', 'rather', 'hitting', 'viewer', 'head', 'special', 'effects', 'heavy-handed', 'allegory', 'relationship', 'Hershey', 'Peterson', 'Hershey', 'inconsistent', 'Irish', 'accent', 'Peterson', 'sometimes', 'too-relaxed', 'performance', 'unexpectedly', 'poignant', 'film', 'human', 'relations', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'perfectly', 'observed', 'even', 'potentially', 'melodramatic', 'subplot', 'resolved', 'satisfying', 'way', 'film', 'are', 'signs', 'unusual', 'quality', 'production.While', 'movie', 'out', 'nondescript', 'footing', 'giving', 'hints', 'Western', 'cliches', 'recall', 'old', '34', 'nuns', 'Wild', 'West', '34', 'films', 'gradually', 'power', 'Peterson', 'way', 'story', 'Honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'moved', 'so', 'deeply', 'film', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'much', 'way', 'originality', 'really', 'have', 'see', 'film', 'believe', 'one', 'most', 'mature', 'spiritually', 'rich', 'humanized', 'portrayals', 'religion', 'film', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'also', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'where', ""'re"", 'not', 'entirely', 'certain', 'just', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'other', 'expecting', 'staircase', 'be', 'completed', 'plot', 'simple', 'depth', 'relationships', 'are', 'deep', 'highly', 'recommend']",STAIRCASE - The Staircase
