416424,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,6304360983,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[24, 25]","Not my usual film fare, I happened to bump into this film by accident and I'm glad I did.  While my knowledge about Native American culture is anything but comprehensive, I found myself swept along 'Pow Wow Highway.'  A touching and funny peek into the reservation blues that are part and parcel of the American 'Indian' experience, this film touches all who take a chance on it.This could have another been another Smoke Signals, poignant and light-hearted, but this film has more meat to it.  The reason:  the very meaty and lovable Gary Farmer.  Farmer's heart-warming performance as Philbert Bono---overweight warrior on his own vision quest---is reason enough to watch this film. Farmer's character doesn't say much nor does he need to.  Every stare, twinkle in the eye, and puckish smile tells us everything we need to know.The film starts off with Philbert daydreaming in his reservation's junk yard.  The ugliness of reservation reality surrounds:  flimsy mobile homes and trashed-out cars, but Philbert sees beyond all that.  He spies himself his 'war-pony,' a rusted-out '64 Buick and saddles up for his adventure.  His quest is to become a true Cheyenne warrior.  Things don't start off so smoothly as Philbert's childhood friend, the angry young AIM-er, Buddy Red Bow (A Martinez), sets out to rescue his sister.  Caught with weed in her car, Red Bow is determined to set her free from the hayseed Anglo cops of the Santa Fe PD.  Thus begins Red Bow and Philbert's journey of self-discovery.  A journey of finding out what it means to be Native American, and more importantly, what it means to be human.  Like Sancho Panza and Don Quixote, Philbert and Red Bow represent two sides of the human coin: passion and reason.  Red Bow is all anger and resentment against an Establishment that has robbed, raped and killed his people for over three hundred years.  In every scene, we see the seething revolutionary ready to strike.  At anybody.  One of the film's funniest scenes is when the war pony needs a stereo.  Confronted with a condescending salesman, they surprise him and buy the priciest stuff in the shop, shattering his 'impoverished Indian' stereotype.  Soon installed in the pony, the new equipment doesn't seem to work, sending Red Bow into a rage, thrashing both shop and owner.  And through it  all, Philbert searches for and finds the problem: in the instruction manual. Think before you act.  A clich&eacute;ed lesson, but valuable all the same. This interplay between Philbert and Red Bow dominates the whole trip.  Whereas Red Bow talks like a warrior, Philbert acts like one.  With shrewdness, intelligence, dignity and most of all, humor, Philbert becomes the 'trickster' indeed, masking a deepness of character beneath his childish silliness.  Red Bow bitches about the Pine Ridge Pow Wow being nothing more than 'drums in a gym,' while Philbert involves himself in every bit of his past he can.  He beats the drum, he climbs the sacred Black Hills, he talks of Cheyenne legends over the CB, while Red Bow fumes and glooms.  Red Bow even mistakes the Hills for 'somewhere outside Pueblo.' A grand faux pas.  As a result, it is Philbert who becomes the real hero, the real warrior.  His weapon is his quietly earned self-knowledge.  With silent strength and subtle humour, he takes back what Red Bow with all his rebellion can't: an identity nearly destroyed through years of oppression and negligence.  It is no coincidence that by the time they free Red Bow's sister (again, Philbert's doing), Philbert has transformed into his real self: Nightcloud Whirlwind, a warrior.The beauty of this film is that is goes far beyond social history.  Pow Wow Highway shows the wide range of 'types' in the Native American community from assimilated 'collaborator'  selling tribal land to mining companies to the tortured and lost Vietnam veteran (brilliantly played by Graham Greene).  So wide and rich is the film's parade of characters that we forget that this is supposed to be a 'Native American' film.  We see friends and family in these characters and yes, eventually ourselves. And this I think was director Wack's goal: to break down the borders set up by our labels, Native American or otherwise.While the ending is a bit too predictable and some characters never really get to fly (Red Bow's sister, the fellow AIM activist), Pow Wow Highway is well worth the watching.

416428,A3C1Q9TRP83BYB,6304360983,Daniel A. Brown,"[2, 2]","A road movie about two contemporary Cheyenne traveling down to New Mexico to spring a relative from prison. Buddy Red Bow (A. Martinez) is a young militant activist with a quick, angry temper. His gargantuan friend, Philbert (Gary Farmer), is a portrait of inner peace with an unlimited appetite to match. Together they mirror the political and spiritual aspects of modern Indian life. Buddy wants to protect his people from the forces of greed surrounding them (his sister is framed on a phony drug charge to lure him off the rez during a crucial tribal council vote). Philbert wants to find his soul-power as a Cheyenne warrior would have done in the old days (his battered auto is christened ""Protector""). The pragmatism of the former and the dreaminess of the other first clash but eventually compliment. The foundation of this story is as much about their past and present relationship as the adventure of getting to their destination and home again in one piece. This is the first mainstream movie that deals intelligently with current issues facing native peoples, ""Powwow"" got over-shadowed by the ""Dances With Wolves"" hoopla that followed on the heels of its release. A pity, too, because this is a far superior movie that achieved cult status for a time.

Farmer's breakout role as Philbert Bono, the Cheyenne ""warrior"" who goes on a spirit quest, accompanying his friend, an American Indian Movement (AIM) activist (A Martinez), on a cross-country trek to Santa Fe, New Mexico, is surely the heart of this splendid little film; perhaps the first to portray realistically the lives of contemporary American Indians (As I have often pointed out to friends and acquaintances, most American Indians barely survive above the poverty line, and those that are marginally successful, such as most on the Navajo reservation, tend to be cowboys and ranchers, not casino owners and employees.).Without ""Powwow Highway"" there would have been no ""Dances with Wolves"" or ""Smoke Signals""; American films replete with sympathetic portrayals of American Indians featuring prominent American Indian actors (two of whom, Graham Greene and Wes Studi, part of  the predominantly American Indian cast of ""Powwow Highway"", have since made important careers in Hollywood.). The film also features excellent music composed by Robbie Robertson (formerly of ""The Band"", but also, a prominent rock and roll musician of American Indian heritage) and U2.

416436,AUNHTUF4ATEJM,6304360983,M. C. Crammer,"[9, 10]","If you like independent or foreign films in general, or if you are interested in a non-Hollywood film about American Indians (or Native Americans, if you prefer), I think you'll like this film.  It's one of those non-Hollywood films where the story is more about characters than it is about plot.  The plot is fairly simple -- two Cheyenne men -- best friends -- drive a broken down old car from the northern Wyoming reservation to New Mexico, because one man's sister calls him to tell him she's been arrested on a trumped up charge and is in jail.  He hasn't seen or heard from her in years, but her two children to consider, and she is his sister, so he has to get to Santa Fe to help her. This is coming at a bad time because a mining company is trying to get tribe approval on a contract that this man is opposing.As noted, the real plot involves relationships, both between characters and between Native Americans vs. the dominant culture. Although both friends have a strong sense of their culture and people, one of the two friends is an easy going man who aspires to be a shaman and the other is an intense activist.  It's kind of the Odd Couple contrast, but much more sophisticated than that -- it's about how to be Native American in today's world.The acting was very good and as other reviewers have commented, the sound track (U2 music) was perfect and enhanced the film.  If your idea of a great movie is one starring Sylvester Stallone or Tom Cruise, this may not be the film for you, but if you appreciate slower, simpler, thoughtful films, I recommend this.",5,An engaging and deceptively simple film,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,1575,"['like', 'independent', 'foreign', 'films', 'general', 'are', 'interested', 'non-Hollywood', 'film', 'American', 'Indians', 'Native', 'Americans', 'prefer', 'think', ""'ll"", 'like', 'film', 'one', 'non-Hollywood', 'films', 'where', 'story', 'more', 'characters', 'plot', 'plot', 'fairly', 'simple', 'two', 'Cheyenne', 'men', 'best', 'friends', 'drive', 'broken', 'down', 'old', 'car', 'northern', 'Wyoming', 'reservation', 'New', 'Mexico', 'one', 'man', 'sister', 'tell', 'been', 'arrested', 'trumped', 'up', 'charge', 'jail', ""n't"", 'seen', 'heard', 'years', 'two', 'children', 'consider', 'sister', 'get', 'Santa', 'Fe', 'help', 'coming', 'bad', 'time', 'mining', 'company', 'trying', 'get', 'tribe', 'approval', 'contract', 'man', 'opposing.As', 'noted', 'real', 'plot', 'relationships', 'characters', 'Native', 'Americans', 'vs.', 'dominant', 'culture', 'friends', 'have', 'strong', 'sense', 'culture', 'people', 'one', 'two', 'friends', 'easy', 'going', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'shaman', 'other', 'intense', 'activist', 'kind', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'contrast', 'much', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'how', 'be', 'Native', 'American', 'today', 'world.The', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'sound', 'track', 'U2', 'music', 'was', 'perfect', 'enhanced', 'film', 'idea', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'starring', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'film', 'appreciate', 'slower', 'simpler', 'thoughtful', 'films', 'recommend']",Pow Wow Highway VHS

416438,A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,6304360983,R. Kyle,"[7, 8]","""Powwow Highway"" is a tale of Native American life today, which is very third world.  The film is told via the contrasting stories of two Cheyenne men from Lame Deer, Montana.Philbert Bono (Gary Farmer) is a big, gentle soul who trades his homegrown weed for a `war pony', a beat up old rustbucket of a car, to go out on a traditional vision quest.  He's going to achieve his medicine by gaining three tokens on the way.The first thing he gains is a passenger, his high school best friend, Buddy RedBow (A. Martinez).  Buddy's been claiming his Native American heritage in a more traditional way.  A member of AIM (The American Indian Movement) he's been at Wounded Knee and has earned a Purple Heart in Vietnam.Buddy had no plans to leave the rez.  There's a critical vote coming up on some land issues and he needs to be there to get his tribal members out to the polls, but his sister Bonnie RedBow ( Joannelle Nadine Romero) got arrested in New Mexico on a trumped up drug charge and he's the only one who can get her out of jail and back to her two very young kids.The story's very much an `odd couple' pairing between the two men who take radically different approaches to solving problems.  RedBow is much more confrontational while the gentle Bono seeks ancient wisdom.""Powwow Highway"" takes viewers across the gambit of emotions.  You cannot look upon the third world vistas of Native poverty without being moved to tears.  But, there are light moments where Philbert is telling ancient stories to his friends.The soundtrack of this film is also excellent.  Robbie Robertson provides much of the music, which is well worth listening to.My only wish would be to see some bios of the cast of this film.  A. Martinez, Gary Farmer, and the others are all people who I'd like to learn more about.Rebecca Kyle, June 2008",5,Welcome to the third world,1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,1823,"['Powwow', 'Highway', 'tale', 'Native', 'American', 'life', 'today', 'very', 'third', 'world', 'film', 'told', 'contrasting', 'stories', 'two', 'Cheyenne', 'men', 'Lame', 'Deer', 'Montana.Philbert', 'Bono', 'Gary', 'Farmer', 'big', 'gentle', 'soul', 'who', 'homegrown', 'weed', 'war', 'pony', 'beat', 'up', 'old', 'rustbucket', 'car', 'go', 'out', 'traditional', 'vision', 'quest', 'going', 'achieve', 'medicine', 'gaining', 'three', 'tokens', 'way.The', 'first', 'thing', 'gains', 'passenger', 'high', 'school', 'best', 'friend', 'Buddy', 'RedBow', 'A.', 'Martinez', 'Buddy', 'been', 'claiming', 'Native', 'American', 'heritage', 'more', 'traditional', 'way', 'member', 'AIM', 'American', 'Indian', 'Movement', 'been', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'earned', 'Purple', 'Heart', 'Vietnam.Buddy', 'had', 'plans', 'leave', 'rez', 'critical', 'vote', 'coming', 'up', 'land', 'issues', 'be', 'there', 'get', 'tribal', 'members', 'out', 'polls', 'sister', 'Bonnie', 'RedBow', 'Joannelle', 'Nadine', 'Romero', 'got', 'arrested', 'New', 'Mexico', 'trumped', 'up', 'drug', 'charge', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'jail', 'back', 'two', 'very', 'young', 'kids.The', 'story', 'very', 'much', 'odd', 'couple', 'pairing', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'take', 'radically', 'different', 'approaches', 'solving', 'problems', 'RedBow', 'much', 'more', 'confrontational', 'gentle', 'Bono', 'ancient', 'wisdom', 'Powwow', 'Highway', 'viewers', 'gambit', 'emotions', 'can', 'not', 'look', 'third', 'world', 'vistas', 'Native', 'poverty', 'being', 'moved', 'tears', 'are', 'light', 'moments', 'where', 'Philbert', 'telling', 'ancient', 'stories', 'friends.The', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'also', 'excellent', 'Robbie', 'Robertson', 'much', 'music', 'well', 'worth', 'listening', 'to.My', 'only', 'wish', 'would', 'be', 'see', 'bios', 'cast', 'film', 'A.', 'Martinez', 'Gary', 'Farmer', 'others', 'are', 'people', 'who', ""'d"", 'like', 'learn', 'more', 'about.Rebecca', 'Kyle', 'June', '2008']",Pow Wow Highway VHS
416439,AYIHIIOO7Z6P0,6304360983,Ruth Henriquez Lyon,"[112, 118]","The first time I saw this movie, I was struck mostly by how much fun it was to watch. There is an offbeat, good-natured humour that softens the harshness of some of the settings and situations. (Much of the music is beautiful--it's by Robbie Robertson but he's not mentioned for it in the credits.) The story line is well-developed, with good transitions between two converging sub-plots. The basic plot is quite simple: two friends, Philbert Bono (Gary Farmer) and Buddy RedBow (A Martinez) take off on a road trip from a Montana Indian reservation to New Mexico in order to get RedBow's sister out of jail. Along the way they form a friendship, despite differences in personality and ways of looking at life.After seeing the movie a second time, it became clear to me that much of what divides them in the beginning has to do with different styles of being or becoming a ""warrior."" Redbow is a Vietnam vet, as well as an activist who was present at the Wounded Knee conflict. He has a lot of anger about the depredations of white people as well as, I suspect, his Vietnam experience. His idea of carrying out a campaign has to do with fighting, guns, and discharging rage.Philbert Bono, on the other hand, has never seen any combat action. He's a peaceful sort and regarded by others as an overweight buffoon. However, he's on a spiritual quest to gather power and become a spiritual warrior. His idea of carrying out a campaign has to do with getting the universal forces on his side. The dynamic tension between Philbert and Buddy define the second plot that runs parallel to the basic story line.By the end of the film the two men have worked out a strong friendship and respectful working relationship, but it is clearly Philbert's approach to warriorship which ultimately carries more weight. The movie does have a few plot flaws, but they are insignificant compared to the interest evoked by Philbert Bono's journey, which is one of inner seeking combined with action in the outer world.",5,explores two different approaches to warriorship,964656000,"07 27, 2000",2000,1995,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'struck', 'mostly', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'was', 'watch', 'offbeat', 'good-natured', 'humour', 'harshness', 'settings', 'situations', 'Much', 'music', 'beautiful', 'Robbie', 'Robertson', 'not', 'mentioned', 'credits', 'story', 'line', 'well-developed', 'good', 'transitions', 'two', 'converging', 'sub-plots', 'basic', 'plot', 'quite', 'simple', 'two', 'friends', 'Philbert', 'Bono', 'Gary', 'Farmer', 'Buddy', 'RedBow', 'A', 'Martinez', 'take', 'off', 'road', 'trip', 'Montana', 'Indian', 'reservation', 'New', 'Mexico', 'order', 'get', 'RedBow', 'sister', 'jail', 'way', 'form', 'friendship', 'differences', 'personality', 'ways', 'looking', 'life.After', 'seeing', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'became', 'clear', 'much', 'what', 'beginning', 'do', 'different', 'styles', 'being', 'becoming', 'warrior', 'Redbow', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'as', 'well', 'activist', 'who', 'was', 'present', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'conflict', 'lot', 'anger', 'depredations', 'white', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'suspect', 'Vietnam', 'experience', 'idea', 'carrying', 'out', 'campaign', 'do', 'fighting', 'guns', 'discharging', 'rage.Philbert', 'Bono', 'other', 'hand', 'never', 'seen', 'combat', 'action', 'peaceful', 'sort', 'regarded', 'others', 'overweight', 'buffoon', 'However', 'spiritual', 'quest', 'gather', 'power', 'become', 'spiritual', 'warrior', 'idea', 'carrying', 'out', 'campaign', 'do', 'getting', 'universal', 'forces', 'side', 'dynamic', 'tension', 'Philbert', 'Buddy', 'define', 'second', 'plot', 'parallel', 'basic', 'story', 'line.By', 'end', 'film', 'two', 'men', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'strong', 'friendship', 'respectful', 'working', 'relationship', 'clearly', 'Philbert', 'approach', 'warriorship', 'ultimately', 'more', 'weight', 'movie', 'have', 'few', 'plot', 'flaws', 'are', 'insignificant', 'compared', 'interest', 'evoked', 'Philbert', 'Bono', 'journey', 'one', 'inner', 'seeking', 'combined', 'action', 'outer', 'world']",Pow Wow Highway VHS
416440,A3K2UPVYXZMF0N,6304360983,Yuli Martov,"[22, 25]","There have been a plethora movies about Native Americans in recent years, which are a bit misleading. For instance, Sherman Alexie in his movie Smoke Signals, portrays us as half-minded individuals who never leave their reservations. Watching these sorts of movies, I feel somewhat offended. In addition, the Indians on Smoke Signals spoke with a southern Accent, which makes them sound retarded! Well, the makers of Pow Wow Highway didn't distort the facts, the way others movies have.The protagonist is a political activist, named Sunny Redbow, who is protesting the installation of a mine(in all probability a pit-mine, which just destroys the beauty of an area) on the Lame Deer Indian Reservation. So the organization which is trying to build the mine, diverts Redbow's efforts by having the FBI(which was run in a despotic J. Edgar Hoover-esque way at the time), arrest his sister, Bonnie Redbow, on some bogus drug charge. After this, the movie takes a sort of &quot;48 hours&quot; buddy movie twist. To clarify, Sunny Redbow doesn't have the necessary means to get to Santa Fe, New Mexico(where Bonnie was arrested), so he asks his best friend, Philbert Bono, to give him a ride. Philbert Bono, who recently just acquired a vehicle, which he affectionately refers to as his &quot;War Pony&quot;, agrees. And the interval between Sunny Redbow's departure from Lame Deer Montana, to the freeing of Bonnie Redbow in New Mexico, is probably the most hilarious few hours I have had the pleasure to visualize. They encounter members of the GOON squad(an anti-AIM organization funded by the US government, which intimidated red nationalists by scare tactics, such as drive-by shootings and physical assault), the Sante Fe police department, fellow Indians, and of course, the elements(i.e. the weather). Without question, this is one of the five best movies that you will ever see, so please, purchase it.",5,A Movie Classic.,979862400,"01 19, 2001",2001,1906,"['have', 'been', 'plethora', 'movies', 'Native', 'Americans', 'recent', 'years', 'are', 'bit', 'misleading', 'instance', 'Sherman', 'Alexie', 'movie', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'half-minded', 'individuals', 'who', 'never', 'leave', 'reservations', 'Watching', 'sorts', 'movies', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'offended', 'addition', 'Indians', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'spoke', 'southern', 'Accent', 'sound', 'retarded', 'Well', 'makers', 'Pow', 'Wow', 'Highway', 'did', ""n't"", 'distort', 'facts', 'way', 'others', 'movies', 'have.The', 'protagonist', 'political', 'activist', 'named', 'Sunny', 'Redbow', 'who', 'protesting', 'installation', 'mine', 'probability', 'pit-mine', 'just', 'beauty', 'area', 'Lame', 'Deer', 'Indian', 'Reservation', 'organization', 'trying', 'build', 'mine', 'Redbow', 'efforts', 'having', 'FBI', 'was', 'run', 'despotic', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover-esque', 'way', 'time', 'arrest', 'sister', 'Bonnie', 'Redbow', 'bogus', 'drug', 'charge', 'movie', 'sort', 'quot', '48', 'hours', 'quot', 'movie', 'twist', 'clarify', 'Sunny', 'Redbow', ""n't"", 'have', 'necessary', 'means', 'get', 'Santa', 'Fe', 'New', 'Mexico', 'where', 'Bonnie', 'was', 'arrested', 'so', 'best', 'friend', 'Philbert', 'Bono', 'give', 'ride', 'Philbert', 'Bono', 'who', 'recently', 'just', 'acquired', 'vehicle', 'affectionately', 'quot', 'War', 'Pony', 'quot', 'interval', 'Sunny', 'Redbow', 'departure', 'Lame', 'Deer', 'Montana', 'freeing', 'Bonnie', 'Redbow', 'New', 'Mexico', 'probably', 'most', 'hilarious', 'few', 'hours', 'have', 'had', 'pleasure', 'visualize', 'encounter', 'members', 'GOON', 'squad', 'anti-AIM', 'organization', 'funded', 'US', 'government', 'intimidated', 'red', 'nationalists', 'scare', 'tactics', 'such', 'drive-by', 'shootings', 'physical', 'assault', 'Sante', 'Fe', 'police', 'department', 'fellow', 'Indians', 'course', 'elements', 'i.e', 'weather', 'question', 'one', 'five', 'best', 'movies', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'please', 'purchase']",Pow Wow Highway VHS
