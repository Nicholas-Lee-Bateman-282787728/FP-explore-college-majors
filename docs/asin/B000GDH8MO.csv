This movie certainly helped me release some pent up and confused emotions.Overall, I found this subtle film captivating with raw emotion and excellent acting.  So much is dealt with when such a topic is approached and the chosen plot line of seeking a roommate for a premise was genius.This must have been an overpowering experience in play form and the only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is because it 90% succeeds as a transfer to film.There are very few characters and the viewer must be prepared to think and absorb all the intensense emotions while viewing. As I stated, I found all the acting to be superior except for the female friend. She was the only one who made it appear as if she was still on a stage and taking cues from the director.  I found her performance flat and so different from all the others.Otherwise an exceptional film.  This writer, producer and director Brian Sloan also made I THINK I DO - a wonderful gay romantic film that is one of my all time favorite gay movies.

1002081,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000GDH8MO,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[12, 12]","Eric's roommate gave him notice that he would be moving out of his SoHo (south Manhattan) apartment, so Eric put an ad in the Village Voice for a new roommate.  The date was September 10, 2001.Over the next several weeks, Eric's phone rang constantly with people interested in the apartment, which they are stunned to learn has a ""WTC View"" (2005), about 12 blocks from ""Ground Zero."" Much has been written and portrayed about the apparent tough, grim determination of the residents of New York City in the weeks following 9/11. What this film shows, quite effectively through the characters in this film (including a diverse stream of potential roommates) is the raw emotion they each dealt with in some manner, dealing with lives that had changed dramatically by the events of that fateful day.  As his visitors talk about their experiences, Eric tries to relate to their feelings, as he deals with his own repressed shock from witnessing the devastation, manifested in panic every time the lights flicker or he hears a siren in the night, and faces a personal loss he didn't realize would affect him.  His best friend, Josie, suffers marital problems, with the uncertainty following the attacks clouding their plans to have a child.  Eric also connects with one potential roommate who was in one of the towers on that day, but who ends up holding Eric throughout the night as the thoughts of the attack trigger one of his frequent panic attacks.""WTC View"" was written/directed/produced by gay novelist Brian Sloane, who first produced it for a New York City stage festival, using the same actors who appear in the film.  The story is loosely based on true events, as he actually had advertised his downtown Manhattan apartment to share the day before the attacks.In my opinion, the film is an understated yet emotionally powerful masterpiece, with remarkable performances from its cast of young actors.  Although it takes place solely in Eric's apartment, it incorporates photos of the post-9/11 New York City in its segues between scenes, but wisely avoids any scenes of the attacks or Ground Zero.  If you are going to see one ""WTC"" film this year, make it this one.

1002082,A2VG08S8VI7820,B000GDH8MO,David T. Webb,"[5, 5]","I recently had a chance to screen this film with the director present.  He said that his two inspirations for this movie came from Rear Window and Rosemary's Baby.  Not exactly two films that come to mind when you think of a 9/11 movie.  However, they are fitting.  The main character in the movie is trapped in his apartment.  We do not see the outside world until the last frame.  His prospective tenants go and look out the window of the  bedroom and we know what they are looking at without ever seeing it.  We do not see it because it is not a movie about us.  It is a movie about the characters on screen and their dealing with the tragedy.  Writer /director Brian Sloan has captured almost every angle of reactions to that day.  Perhaps the most interesting reaction comes from Alex(Nick Potenzieri), as someone who was actually in the tower when the plane hit. He has a positive look on life, and begins to look at everything differently.  This movie would be fascinating enough if it were just about prospective roomates and their dealings with Septemeber 11 but it isn't.  It becomes much more as we deal with Eric and how profoundly he was affected by that day.  This movie is an intimate, moving portrayal of events that we all know, but in a much different way than we have ever seen.  I highly reccomend it if you can find it to watch.",5,powerful,1160870400,"10 15, 2006",2006,1349,"['recently', 'had', 'chance', 'screen', 'film', 'director', 'present', 'said', 'two', 'inspirations', 'movie', 'came', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Not', 'exactly', 'two', 'films', 'come', 'mind', 'when', 'think', '9/11', 'movie', 'However', 'are', 'fitting', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'trapped', 'apartment', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'outside', 'world', 'last', 'frame', 'prospective', 'tenants', 'go', 'look', 'out', 'window', 'bedroom', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'ever', 'seeing', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'not', 'movie', 'movie', 'characters', 'screen', 'dealing', 'tragedy', 'Writer', '/director', 'Brian', 'Sloan', 'captured', 'almost', 'angle', 'reactions', 'day', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'reaction', 'Alex', 'Nick', 'Potenzieri', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'tower', 'when', 'plane', 'hit', 'positive', 'look', 'life', 'look', 'everything', 'differently', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'fascinating', 'enough', 'were', 'just', 'about', 'prospective', 'roomates', 'dealings', 'Septemeber', '11', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'deal', 'Eric', 'how', 'profoundly', 'was', 'affected', 'day', 'movie', 'intimate', 'moving', 'portrayal', 'events', 'know', 'much', 'different', 'way', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'can', 'find', 'watch']",WTC View
1002083,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B000GDH8MO,J. Martin,"[0, 0]","Although I had moved a few miles north before the World Trade Center was attacked, and I didn't look down the Hudson River and see smoke where the towers used to be until after they'd both fallen, I was deeply shocked, and I grieved for them for at least ten years. It was the most painful experience of my adult life. I didn't know anyone who died there; I was grieving for the buildings, which had been there in the background of my life like an anchor I didn't know was so important until it was gone.But those wounds finally healed, and seeing this movie now, in 2013, isn't as cathartic for me as it might have been when it first came out eight years ago, when my grief still seemed inconsolable. So for me, now, this is just a movie, and I respond to it as if it were about a subject that never affected me at all.As a movie, it's better than I expected it to be. Michael Urie and Elizabeth Kapplow are excellent as Eric and Josie, and the rest of the cast are good enough not to be distracting (except for Jeremy Beazlie's horrendous British accent). The direction is surprisingly good, which is unusual when a playwright adapts his own play to the screen and also directs it; that's almost always a formula for failure, but Sloan does it fairly well.As a play, it's beautifully written, never predictable or trite, and I'm sure it was deeply moving when performed live in a theatre. Unfortunately, the transition to film could have been better. But that's a very hard transition to make, and nobody has EVER done it perfectly except Mike Nichols with Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.So although I admired this movie a lot, I never really believed it, never got deeply involved in Eric's trauma, because I could never get past the knowledge that he was acting.Stage acting and movie acting are very, very different; and this was a play performed for a camera instead of an audience: admirably done, but the stage-bound formality of both the writing and the acting kept me at a distance emotionally.",3,"Beautifully written, but could have been better adapted to the screen",1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,2004,"['had', 'moved', 'few', 'miles', 'north', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'was', 'attacked', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'down', 'Hudson', 'River', 'see', 'smoke', 'where', 'towers', 'used', 'be', ""'d"", 'fallen', 'was', 'deeply', 'shocked', 'grieved', 'least', 'ten', 'years', 'was', 'most', 'painful', 'experience', 'adult', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'died', 'was', 'grieving', 'buildings', 'had', 'been', 'there', 'background', 'life', 'anchor', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'so', 'important', 'was', 'gone.But', 'wounds', 'finally', 'healed', 'seeing', 'movie', 'now', '2013', ""n't"", 'as', 'cathartic', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'eight', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'grief', 'still', 'seemed', 'inconsolable', 'So', 'now', 'just', 'movie', 'respond', 'were', 'subject', 'never', 'affected', 'movie', 'better', 'expected', 'be', 'Michael', 'Urie', 'Elizabeth', 'Kapplow', 'are', 'excellent', 'Eric', 'Josie', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'not', 'be', 'distracting', 'Jeremy', 'Beazlie', 'horrendous', 'British', 'accent', 'direction', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'unusual', 'when', 'playwright', 'own', 'play', 'screen', 'also', 'almost', 'always', 'formula', 'failure', 'Sloan', 'fairly', 'well.As', 'play', 'beautifully', 'written', 'never', 'predictable', 'trite', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'deeply', 'moving', 'when', 'performed', 'live', 'theatre', 'Unfortunately', 'transition', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'very', 'hard', 'transition', 'make', 'nobody', 'EVER', 'done', 'perfectly', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'Who', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Woolf.So', 'admired', 'movie', 'lot', 'never', 'really', 'believed', 'never', 'got', 'deeply', 'involved', 'Eric', 'trauma', 'could', 'never', 'get', 'knowledge', 'was', 'acting.Stage', 'acting', 'movie', 'acting', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'different', 'was', 'play', 'performed', 'camera', 'instead', 'audience', 'admirably', 'done', 'stage-bound', 'formality', 'writing', 'acting', 'kept', 'distance', 'emotionally']",WTC View

But after 9/11 he really needs a roommate, a friend or anyone who can make him feel safe and secure.Out Eric's room with a view, the view was that of the World Trade Center.  Everyone who comes to view the apartment takes a look out the window.  That view is never shown.  Instead we are looking in at the faces looking out and we see what they are feeling.Eric finds that everyone is so noncommital about renting the room.  Does everyone know think life is so temporary that an apartment might be unnecessary?  Are possible tennants really moving out of the city?  Why does Eric keep raising the rent when he speaks with potential roommates?  Does he actually want a roommate or is he actually operating on another agenda.We know from his conversations with his friend and potential roommates that he broke up with his boyfriend recently because the boyfriend wanted them to move in together.  Eric says that was crazy...it was too soon...he wasn't ready for that.  All the while interviewing possible roommates, Eric may have been realizing that there are ample reasons for him to have moved in with his boyfriend---most notably life is short and unpredictable.This film is noteworthy for the way it feels---it's a Broadway show on film and it really feels like a  theater production.
