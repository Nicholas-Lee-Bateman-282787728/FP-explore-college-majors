There were several occasions that I thought it was a joke and realized that it was really her acting.  I love the premises of the show but we spend too much time watching Allison and Joe argue in the bedroom.  EVERY EPISODE.  Not to mention that Jake Weber has many scenes where he has to walk around in his boxers, showing EXACTLY what he is packing every time.

Patricia Arquette does a wonderful job, and the rest of the cast does just as well. I manage to enjoy it because I'm able to suspend disbelief; I'm able to suspend dispbelief because they do such a great job making the show.  As fiction, this is brilliant.

He's completely miscast, he must be related to someone.  He's exactly like David Spade, even looks like him.  He always looks haggard and sloppy and is not the caliber of actor that this part calls for.  He's no rocket scientist!  Just the idea that he's matched with Particia Arquette makes my skin crawl.

You can skip to the extended version which only has a couple of expanded scenes. I was really hoping for some of the characters in the pilot to make it into the regular episodes. I will not go through each episode so that you may have the fun of discovery.Great formula as Allison Dubois (Patricia Arquette) who has a gift since childhood of talking to the dead and getting physique vibes. She diagnoses or misdiagnoses crime scenes for a local district attorneys office.  Natural the are the skeptics with negative attitudes to overcome and obscure mental images to be interpreted. She must also do this while balancing housework, kids, and a husband that can be a snot at times. There is usually a quirky twist in the end of each episode.Bottom line is that you can get hooked on the series and will feel cheated when you run out of episodes. It is interesting that they spread the abilities around in the family instead of keeping just to Allison.The only disappointing part of this the first season is that they only show half a story on the last disk, forcing you to wait for the next season to publish.

Eventually she becomes a consultant for the DA, which uses her insight to track murderers, serial killer, etc, helping with investigations that would otherwise go unsolved. The series is loosely based on the real life psychic and medium Allison Dubois, although many of the stories have been embellished and changed for the sake of good storytelling. However, the conflicts and issues of a real life ""sensitive"" are done extremely well and are very realistic. Allison is portaid as a very unglamorous figure, down to earth, with a normal husband and kids (well almost normal kids), trying to live a normal life while also staying true to the inner promptings and messages she is receiving that are obviously working through her to achieve some form of higher good.

170591,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,1415721092,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[5, 5]","Others have done a good job of reviewing the show concept --- so I'll just recap briefly. Based in part on the life experiences of a woman named Allison Dubois, this series features Patricia Arquette in an Emmy award-winning portrayal as a psychic-medium. As she comes to grips with her talents in this area, she helps the Phoenix district attorney with a variety of cases, but also wrestles complicated moral issues and deals with her at-home situation. She has three daughters and a husband who's an engineer, but is learning to accept the new complications that her work brings.Being a fan of series such as ""Now and Again"" (which was created and written in large part by the same people involved with this) and ""Tru Calilng,"" I immediately tuned into and clicked with this series. While I too possess a logical mind, oriented somewhat towards engineering and computer-programming, my mind is open to these ideas, and in any case, I enjoy a well-written and acted series.If you're interested in this DVD, there's a good chance you've already seen the first season or at least some of it and know all about the program. So you may be wondering about the special features on this DVD set. I can definitely say they're awesome and here's a rundown of what you'll find:- Extended version of Pilot --- Include several minutes of additional material seamlessly reintegrated into the show pilot. Most noteable here is a meal-time conversation between Allison and Captain Push that wasn't seen in the original.- Deleted scenes for several episodes --- As with most good television programs, these scenes weren't deleted necessaarily because there was anything wrong with them. They just needed to cut them for time and they weren't absolutely essential to the plot. Most of these are fairly short --- about thirty seconds to a minute.- Optional commentary --- cast and crew commentaries for several of the season's noteable episodes. Unlike some DVD commentaries, these generally make for interesting listening.- The Making of ""Medium"" --- Goes over casting, creation, and other noteables.- The Story of ""Medium"" --- Digs into the show story elements, also touches on some of that discussed in the ""making-of.""- Interpreting Allison Dubois --- Discusses the issues of the characters life --- family and moral.- The Real Allison Dubois --- A profile of the the real person on which the character is based.

Over a series of nights, Allison sees more and more details about the victims, which she shares with her boss, Phoenix District Attorney Manuel Devalos, and detective Lee Scanlon.On the homefront, Allison is accompanied by her laidback husband Joe, a scientist, and their three daughters, Ariel, Bridgette and Marie. The girls are far apart in age -- Ariel in junior high, Bridgette in elementary, and little Marie just a toddler -- giving room to all sorts of growing-up issues. In this first season, the two older girls also show evidence of having inherited some of their mother's psychic abilities, which troubles both Allison and Joe.Although there are other shows currently on air with extraordinary heroines, ""Medium"" continues to stand apart. Unlike some of the others, such as ""Ghost Whisperer"" starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, ""Medium"" doesn't try to make its cast look superhuman. Dreams aside, Allison's just a busy woman juggling a career and family, and she actually can be seen picking up dry cleaning or wearing old t-shirts as she hurriedly fixes her girls a late supper.Conversely, ""GW""'s Melinda is perfect -- both in appearance and the way her life always goes her way -- which gets stale to the viewing audience pretty quickly. Who can possibly relate? Melinda's husband Jim has virtually no storylines of his own; his entire purpose appears to be supporting Melinda, listening to her prattle on about the cases she's working on, and maintaining the house for her as though he doesn't have a job himself.

What I didnt realize was that this show is for BELIEVERS AND NONBELIEVERS alike. You don't have to believe in psychics or mindreading abilities.Because, let's face it: so many movies, from Batman to Lord of the Rings, depend on our suspension of belief, on our saying, ""What if?"" Medium is no different. If you believe, fine; if not, you can simply say, ""What if? What if someone COULD read minds?""And so I decided to go along with the premise and imagine what it WOULD be like for someone who had the psychic abilities Allison does. I also became involved in the details of her life, her family and how her job and home life intertwine. This isn't a series built around a ""gimmick"". It is a fully fleshed out show, one that gets more complex and interesting as time goes on.The relationship between Allison and her husband is a bit edgy, not always smooth and harmonious. They clearly love each other but he becomes frustrated with her at times. After all, she has a habit of waking up from terrible dreams, often in the middle of the night,dreams warning her of some impending crisis - or perhaps giving her clues to solve a crime. In any case, she is always having visions and she is also quite sensitive. This leaves him baffled  - and sometimes his anger comes out.Her job and home life can't be kept separate. They intersect in all sorts of ways and it is this connection that gives the show real substance. At this point, I can't wait to see what happens next. Patricia Arquette seems to be more comfortable with her role as time goes on, seems to have a real sense of who Allison is.

170597,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,1415721092,Lee Armstrong,"[4, 4]","""The Medium"" instantly became my favorite show on television in 2005.  I usually am fascinated by shows with elements of the paranormal, which tuned me in.  However, it is the realism of the family relationship that is most fascinating.  Patricia Arquette who was in ""Ed Wood"" with Johnny Depp plays Alison DuBois.  Her Emmy win for Best Actress in a drama attests to her standing within the industry, but the on-screen chemistry with Jake Weber who was in ""Meet Joe Black"" and plays her husband Joe is riveting.  They fight, spat, try to mask conflict in front of their kids, juggle an impossible number of real-life tasks, and have layers of humor and romance that make this seem like a real family that loves each other and deals with the unusual circumstances of Alison's psychic ability.  I found after watching the initial show that when the reruns would show, I still wanted to watch them over episodes of CSI Miami that I had not seen.  When I bought the DVD, I was hoping there might have been an episode I'd missed, but I'd seen them all between NBC & Lifetime reruns several times.  I'm impressed by how entrancing each episode is and the quality of the writing.  Alison's dreams are like clues that she struggles to fit together.  What impresses me about Alison is that she sincerely struggles to do the right thing.  In a world of violence, it's often hard to be clear which way the moral compass points.  In the episode ""In Sickness & Adultery"" her tip places her on the witness stand with an unethical hostile prosecutor that seeks to embarrass her.  As she comes back that he cheated to pass his law exams and is cheating on his wife, she finds that her best defense is the truth.  The two older daughters are also jewels.  Maria Lark as Bridget often has my entire family in stitches with her offbeat humor like shouting at her mom who wakes screaming from a bad dream, ""Mom, please stop doing that!""  Sofia Vassilieva as the older Aerial keeps the arguments at the breakfast table bouncing.  David Cubitt who plays the reoccurring role of Detective Lee Scanlon also achieves amazing chemistry with Arquette.  Miguel Sandoval as the district attorney Manuel Duvalos has such a focused calmness that he centers the crime portion of the show.  (Perhaps we will sometime see more about his family.)  While it's hard to pick my favorite first season episode, the complex plot of ""A Priest, A Doctor & Medium Walk into an Execution Chamber"" is a jewel, with the police chasing a ghost who apparently has just committed murder.  The DVD commentaries and introduction to the real-life Alison DuBois really give excellent background for fans of the show.  This is one show that reaches the level of art for me.  Its excellence will make it memorable for a long time & this DVD collection a valuable addition to an entertainment collection.

As if that were not enough, she is a law student, and most importantly, a suburban mother that must take care of her family. But how can she help others with her abilities without looking strange to others, people that would very likely consider her a freak or a liar?The solution to Alison's problem comes rather easily, if not too conventionally. She convinces the Phoenix District Attorney Devalos (Miguel Sandoval) that her unusual skills can be very helpful to find and trap criminals, and is afterwards employed by him, without unveiling the real reason of her presence at the District Attorney's office.The first season of ""Medium"" shows us some of the cases Alison helps to investigate, as well as her family life with her husband Joe (Jake Weber), and her two daughters, Ariel (Sofia Vassilieva) and Bridget (Maria Lark). It is interesting to point out that this series was inspired by a real life story, that of a research medium also called Allison Dubois.On the whole, I think that you will enjoy ""Medium"", provided that you like a well-written and produced series that has all the ingredients of a great whodunit, but also some supernatural aspects that make it different (even if you don't believe in mediums!).

The series benefits from its witty reparte between Allison and her sometimes cynical husband Joe, and her three daughters.  Add the stoic DA and a haunted cop and you have the regular series stars.The storylines are all interesting in this first season, focusing not only on Allison's visions but also the problems it brings into her family dynamics and the sometimes hard decisions she must make.Emmy winner Patricia Arquette is brilliant as Allison, bringing nn earthy realism to her difficult role; Jake Weber is equally effective as husband Joe, who finds himself playing mommy and daddy a little too much to his liking, but never losing his affection for Allison, until....no spoilers here.  Miguel Sandoval is good as DA and David Cubitt's Lt. Scanlon is up to his role.  The little girls, Maria Lark and Sonja (can't spell her last name, sorry!) are perfect although at times you just wanna spank them???Anyway, MEDIUM is a refreshingly entertaining drama buoyed by Ms. Arquette's performance.",5,MEDIUM IS WEL.L DONE AND THAT'S RARE,1158019200,"09 12, 2006",2006,1294,"['unusual', 'drama', 'series', 'mind', 'Glenn', 'Gordon', 'Caron', 'creator', '80s', 'megahit', 'MOONLIGHTING', 'time', 'Allison', 'Dubois', 'who', 'based', 'real', 'woman', 'who', 'psychic', 'who', 'gifts', 'help', 'out', 'Phoenix', 'DA', 'PD', 'solving', 'bizarre', 'crimes', 'series', 'benefits', 'witty', 'reparte', 'Allison', 'sometimes', 'cynical', 'husband', 'Joe', 'three', 'daughters', 'Add', 'stoic', 'DA', 'haunted', 'cop', 'have', 'regular', 'series', 'stars.The', 'storylines', 'are', 'interesting', 'first', 'season', 'focusing', 'not', 'only', 'Allison', 'visions', 'also', 'problems', 'family', 'dynamics', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'decisions', 'must', 'make.Emmy', 'winner', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'brilliant', 'Allison', 'bringing', 'nn', 'earthy', 'realism', 'difficult', 'role', 'Jake', 'Weber', 'equally', 'effective', 'husband', 'Joe', 'who', 'playing', 'mommy', 'daddy', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'liking', 'never', 'losing', 'affection', 'Allison', '.no', 'spoilers', 'here', 'Miguel', 'Sandoval', 'good', 'DA', 'David', 'Cubitt', 'Lt.', 'Scanlon', 'up', 'role', 'little', 'girls', 'Maria', 'Lark', 'Sonja', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spell', 'last', 'name', 'sorry', 'are', 'perfect', 'times', 'just', 'wan', 'spank', 'Anyway', 'MEDIUM', 'refreshingly', 'entertaining', 'drama', 'buoyed', 'Ms.', 'Arquette', 'performance']",N/A

170610,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,1415721092,P. Hardy,"[2, 2]","At first glance, 2005s MEDIUM will most defiantly seem like something of a replacement for ""TRU-CALLING"" (for those who actually watched the series before it was canceled by its network) during the midst of the supernatural craze going about in 2005. And like most, MEDIUM certainly had the wrappings of an NBC show soon to be canceled like most of its series coming out, but it surpassingly turns out to be something beyond the simple fact that main character can see and speak to the dead. At first I simply posed the question as to why MEDIUM was based on the escapades of a real-life medium Allison Dubois, when for a fact, this woman wasn't even dead yet (I'm still under the impression that for something to be based on a real person this person has to be dead)? Granted the first episode wasn't all impressive enough to me to even grant it a chance in my eyes. However, gradually, after its finale and rewatching the reruns (before it was logged onto Lifetime [shudders]) I began to appreciate MEDIUM for what it was and not what it wasn't or was obviously not trying to be (Tru Calling). A stunning mixture of science-fiction, crime-drama and supernatural realism -to a point-, with excellent writers and actors at the helm.[. . .Phoenix, Arizona local Allison Dubois (Patricia Arquette) is a strong-willed young mother of three, a devoted wife, and law student who starts an internship at a local District Attorney's office, begins to suspect that she can talk to dead people, see the future in her dreams, and read people's thoughts. Fearing for her mental health, she turns for support to her husband Joe (Jake Weber), an aerospace engineer, who slowly comes to believe that what his wife is telling him just might be true upon discovering that she dreams of a murder in Texas. The real challenge is convincing her boss, D.A. Devalos (Miguel Sandoval) -- and the other doubters in the criminal justice system -- that her psychic abilities can give them the upper hand when it comes to solving violent and horrifying crimes whose mysteries often reside with those who live beyond the grave.Murders and information on certain people or things come to her dreams or visions in cryptic forms and never really mean what they seem to as Allison soon discovers throughout the series. Her daughters, Bridget and Ariel Dubois, appear to have inherited their mother's gift since their 'visions' or 'dreams' usually occur when their mother is in a bind in searching for answers to her own dreams. Bridget (the second youngest child) never appears to be bothered by this, while Ariel usually has a harder time trying to cope with a gift she knows very little about. Allison is occasionally accompanied by local Arizona cop, and friend to Manuel Devalos, Det. Lee Scanlon (David Cubitt), who, at first, also did not believe that she had a ""gift"" upon finding out about it. Allison often bends the rules of the law when she is determined to stop a vision from happening. . .]The series is surprisingly gritty, even more so than NBC's ""Law and Order"", on par with shows like CSI and BONES to a point and uses or reveals its ""violence"" conservatively unlike most shows or movies that depend on this atmosphere alone. The atmosphere of the show itself is oddly borderline normal to an almost believable point. Unlike most series you can nearly believe that MEDIUM is real to a point, visually anyhow. Each episode is cleverly (and sometimes obviously) written and directed according to the person or crime Allison happens to be involved. It throws you for a loop and does the complete opposite of the original intent most of the time. And the end results usually don't fail in the surprising department, something most shows nowadays lack seriously. Though there are more than one episodes that contain the annoying ""is my husband cheating on me?/Fighting spouses"" themes that tend to get on my nerves. And unlike most NBC shows, MEDIUM has little or no sex scenes in a majority of the episodes which is always a plus with me. Characters potrayed by a lot of actors and actresses that would, at first glance, never seem to work well on screen, are quirky and frighteningly human and childish [concerning Ariel, Bridget, and Marie Dubois among other child actors].I can only judge Allison Dubois' character by what I see on television since I've never met the real woman before in my adolescent life. Patricia Arquette usually does well with the female characters she chooses to play as. With what few films I've actually seen her in ---""HOLES"" - ""BEYOND RANGOON""-- I can say that she was an excellent choice for the Dubios character, who would usually be demoted to an overly dramatic character if played by another actress I believe. David Cubitt (10.5 - siggners) and Miguel Sandoval (Clear and Present Danger) potray their characters Lee Scanlon and Manuel Devalos with convincing placidity, dry humor, and professional seriousness that makes them so interesting. Sofia Vassilieva, Maria Lark, Madsion & Miranda Carabello, as Bridget, Ariel, and Marie Dubois are convincing as their characters and portray them as eerily normal children who seemed to have inherited pieces of their mother's rare gift. Lastly, Jake Weber (probably better known for his role in the ""Dawn of the Dead"" 04' remake) as Arquette's husband Joe Dubois as someone who took some major warming up to. Essentially he's an odd sort of person, he's a physically charming looking character as I so quickly noted but his personality was another thing. Nevertheless as time rolled on, I learned to like him the more I watched the series into the second season. Weber's talent, which is rarely noticed in most of the movies he's in, shines through in MEDIUM, giving a usually bland role a kick in the right direction with ability to be funny and serious at the same time. He and Arquette have excellent chemistry together when onscreen, its strange almost to think they're not actually husband and wife ^_^.The music composed for the series hauntingly ear catching and beautiful with the mournful vocals used in the theme song and BGM alike. While most scores for television series have a sound that really lets you know that its a TV show and not a movie their being used for, MEDIUM's score is composed in the motion picture style (like LOST, notably) as opposed to the usual TV-stylized composition. Whether or not is actually OST material is not something I'd rather not bother myself with since the score is most likely never to be released on CD. If it were, it would probably be worth owning for your own listening pleasure to a point. Of course there are times when its incredibly bland and tv-ish, its one of the best scores I've heard for an NBC produced show.[EPISODE LISTING]:01.

170611,A1DRM3JV6T5O6P,1415721092,Phillip Oliver,"[89, 96]","Season One debuted in January 2005 and ran through May with a total of 16 episodes. Based on a true story, the series follows Allison DuBois, an assistant to a district attorney, who has psychic dreams and solves murders. This well-produced series features an intense stand-out performance by Patricia Arquette (a surprise Emmy winner for Best Actress) as well as clever and involving story lines. The only annoyances are an irritating husband who never wants to believe his wife's gift. After several episodes, you would think he would be wiser by now. The cutesy child actors are another burden to the script but at least the middle kid is often funny to watch.Episodes are:#1 - ""Pilot"" -  Allison's husband Joe hopes to prove that Allison's visions are stress related by sending descriptions out to law enforcement agencies. To his surprise, one of Allison's dreams bears an eerie similarity to a Texas homicide case involving a 17-year-old murder suspect.

There are now only references to when she drank, which make no sense in the absence of her drinking.I assume the people responsible for the release on DVD and the quick change when it ran, decided that to show it would turn all who watched it in to crazed alcoholics.  The responsible and REAL thing to do would have been to show her make a decision that alcohol was not the best way to deal with her situation and even go though withdrawal if she drank a year or more.  But now, everyone you are meant to like on TV and Movies must be flawless paragons of virtue.  Not real people.The decision to make Allison less than human hurts the character in my view.The same applies to the very last show in the series.

Emmy winner Patricia Arquette plays Allison DuBois who is studying for her law degree and interning at the D.A.'s office in Arizona. She has scary dreams. Many times these dreams come true or she'll see people long dead that she's never met and they'll tell her something about upcoming events or pass along a message. She suspects that she might have psychic powers. Her husband Joe suggests that she sent along info to authorities on an unsolved murder or mystery and if it turns out to be helpful, well she does have psychic powers but her husband says he suspects they're just dreams. They're not. She is contacted by the Texas Rangers and a Captain (Arliss Howard)who is trying to solve a missing person/murder involving a child flies her to Texas to help. He has his doubts until she discloses something personal about himself that he never told anyone.But then you knew all that didn't you? You saw it in a dream or at the very least on CBS.""Medium"" is a terrific show whether you're a believe in this stuff or not. It's well written and suspenseful with exceptional performances. The DVD set has the first 17 episodes of the show plus an extended version of the pilot that never aired. Aside from the extended version of the pilot (which appears on the first disc) all of the other extras appear on the last disc.We get two nearly  hour featurettes that focuses on the creation of the show and changes that occurred prior to the show getting the green light for shooting the pilot and the series itself. ""The Making of Medium"" features interviews with executive producers Kelsey Grammer (hopefully he'll make a number of guest star turns in the show), Caron, Steve Stark, Ron Schwary and production members such as Ken Kelsch (cinematography who discussed the moody work he contributes to the show), Allison Dubois, actors Arquette (who by the way one a much deserved Emmy for her performance this year for the second season), Jake Weber (who plays her husband Joe), Sandoval and others.""The Story of Medium"" continues with interviews of the usual suspects mentioned above plus input from some of the writers on the show discussing how events involving real medium were crafted to fit the concept of the show. It's a fascinating glimpse into the creative process of creating and writing episodic TV shows.We also get a pair of shorter featurettes that deal with Allison Dubois both real and as imagined in the show. The first ""The Real Allison Dubois"" gives us a portrait of the lady that inspired the show. Ms. Dubois is a natural on camera and it's clear why Caron used this lady as inspiration for his show. She's also a consultant on the show as well. ""Interpreting Allison Dubois"" features Arquette and she discusses the challenges of playing a real person in a fictional setting, the qualities she tries to capture of the real Dubois as well as her take on the character vs. the real person.We also get a humorous gag reel  and some of the TV advertising for the show. It's clear that NBC knew they had a winner on their hands and they gave the show their all in promotional activity (which this spooky winner deserved). We also get deleted scenes for 7 episodes some of which have multiple scenes that were cut for time constraints. Since this is a short TV season (only 17 episodes) I would also like to have seen some previews for the second season (which I haven't watched) and the forthcoming third as long as they are without spoilers. I also would have liked to see commentary tracks from Arquette, Weber and some of the main cast. Perhaps we'll see that on the second season set which is already scheduled for later this year on DVD.We also get four audio commentaries on four episodes two with creator/writer/director/producer Glenn Gordon Caron one done in collaboration with producer Moira Kirkland and the other with executive producer Rene Echevarria (""The 4400"", ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""). The best of the audio commentaries are the two with Glen Gordon Caron although guest star Chad Lowe deserves a special mention for making the most of his commentary track. It's a fun listen.I predict you'll buy this great package and show. But then I didn't need an special abilities to see that. You're visiting this page after all aren't you? Enjoy the show! I'd give ""Medium"" a 9 out of 10 and highly recommend this great show.

Iapproached this series with caution initially because I did not want toSee the ghost of the week. However by the 2nd episode I was fullyImmersed in Medium's own style. It's a mixture of thriller, mystery,Suspense, Hitchcock Sixth Sense and Dead Zone with a family thatActually represents the way a real family is they argue, disagree,Fight yet loves each other. There are no wasted moments in this seriesAnd every episode was enjoyable. How many series can say that? Alison Dubois (Patricia Arquette) the star has psychic abilities by touching someone, dreaming, or being to close to something that that person has touched in some way. Alison has accepted that when this paranormal happens her job is to pursue the matter to resolution even if it affects her family life or personal beliefs.
