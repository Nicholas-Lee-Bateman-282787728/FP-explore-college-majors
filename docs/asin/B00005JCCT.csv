This movie is nothing short of hilarious.  I really can't explain on here.  Some of the things that these guys do is just too out there to be written down.  You really have to see it for yourself.  Watching it over and over is one thing.  However, showing it to your friends is worth the price of the disc.  nuff said.one more thing.  If you watch this, you're going to want to buy CKY's album.

583156,A2H9OOSTD8B9YZ,B00005JCCT,Markarian,"[4, 4]","Okay. There it is within the realm of possibility that a comedy troupe could come along and create a series that is the funniest for a certain demographic (conservative Baby Boomers will despise it). This is that comedy troupe. Camp Kill Yourself, led by the outrageous pro skater Bam Margera, is a serious gang of idiots.There are scenes in this movie that are painfully hilarious, and each one makes you wonder how they got away with it, while retaining their liberty. Augmented by pop music, the skits are fast-paced and only meant to be stupid and funny. If you watch this movie when you are inebriated or extremely tired, it will seem all that much funnier.This movie was so funny, that MTV hired them to do their own TV show, called Jackass. But this movie is completely uncut, and the DVD offers TWICE the good stuff that the VHS has. If you even remotely like skating, are male, and under the age of 28, you will like this movie.
