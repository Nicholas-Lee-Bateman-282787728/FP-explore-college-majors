95349,A1P27BGF8NAI29,0790731045,Alice in Wonderland,"[1, 1]","George Webber is a wealthy and successful composer, but he has reached his 40s, and he knows that his life is slipping away and he has missed so much. But, when he spies Jenny Hanley, an astoundingly beautiful young woman, he sees just what he needs. Jenny becomes George's obsession, and there is nothing he won't do to get her. Sadly, having your heart's desire is not necessarily the key to happiness, as George learns to his chagrine.This is a very good movie. Dudley Moore does an excellent job of presenting George Webber as a bumbling middle-aged man who does not really know what he wants, while Bo Derek gives the performance that launched here career as a sex-symbol. Julie Andrews brings in a stellar performance as Samantha Taylor, giving a rock-solid dramatic performance that makes the situation seem so realistic.Great movie - funny, and sexy, and somewhat tragic.(Review of 10 starring Dudley Moore, Julie Andrews and Bo Derek)",5,"Funny, and sexy, and somewhat tragic",1244160000,"06 5, 2009",2009,943,"['George', 'Webber', 'wealthy', 'successful', 'composer', 'reached', '40s', 'life', 'slipping', 'away', 'missed', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'Jenny', 'Hanley', 'astoundingly', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'just', 'what', 'Jenny', 'George', 'obsession', 'nothing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'get', 'Sadly', 'having', 'heart', 'desire', 'not', 'necessarily', 'key', 'happiness', 'George', 'chagrine.This', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'excellent', 'job', 'presenting', 'George', 'Webber', 'bumbling', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'performance', 'launched', 'here', 'career', 'sex-symbol', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Samantha', 'Taylor', 'giving', 'rock-solid', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'situation', 'seem', 'so', 'realistic.Great', 'movie', 'funny', 'sexy', 'somewhat', 'tragic', 'Review', '10', 'starring', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Bo', 'Derek']",N/A
95350,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790731045,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","So I saw `Arthur' not too long ago and since then I've been dying to see Dudley Moore in something else.  `10' was the perfect film to lunge at since it also happens to sport a performance by an actress I am eternally smitten with; Julie Andrews.  So, with those two `pluses' going for it I decided to swoop in and indulge myself in this comedy.Very worthwhile I might add.`10' tells of music composer George Webber, a man who is obsessed with age, terrified that he has gotten older.  Slipping deep into his midlife crisis he starts repelling the ones closest to him, namely his girlfriend (NOT HIS WIFE) Samantha.  When George gets a brief glimpse at bride-to-be Jenny his life is ignited with a new passion, a passion that makes him forget about his age and feel young again.  So, throwing caution to the wind he hops a plane to Mexico, following this young bride and her husband on their honeymoon.  Separated, both George and Samantha are given time to reflect on their relationship and just where they want it to go.`10' is not a mindless comedy, as some have accused it of being.  It actually has a really good head on its shoulders.  It broaches the fact that men themselves enter their midlife crisis and practically go off their rocker.  It's not that far fetched when you think about it.You have everything going for you yet you have nothing to really show for it and so you wind up not really know what you want.The performances are all wonderfully effective, at times touching and moving; always hilarious.  Moore is stellar here once again; although I'm moved to say I preferred him in `Arthur' (I just loved his irresistible comedic timing in that film).  Bo Derek is in my opinion not a perfect 10 (or 11 as George claims) but I can see why some would find her attractive.  I thought she was somewhat pretty until that infamous beach scene, and those braids just killed it for me (really...that is attractive?).  The really star her is my girlfriend (well, not really) Julie Andrews.  I mean, she just illuminates her every scene with this passion and remarkably fearless drive.  This is unlike any performance I've seen from her; and her quip ""you want to argue or make love"" is just flawlessly delivered.I really liked this movie.  I think that any fan of the cast will too.  It has its off spots, but they are far and few in between; and the relationship that is defined between George and Samantha is enlightening to say the least.  Also look for some nice acting turns by Robert Webber, Dee Wallace and Brian Dennehy, who plays a sympathetic bar tender that practically steals his every scene.",4,"It may not be a perfect 10, but there's nothing wrong with being a 9...",1236211200,"03 5, 2009",2009,2614,"['So', 'saw', 'Arthur', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'then', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dying', 'see', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'something', 'else', '10', 'was', 'perfect', 'film', 'lunge', 'also', 'sport', 'performance', 'actress', 'am', 'eternally', 'smitten', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'So', 'two', 'pluses', 'going', 'decided', 'swoop', 'indulge', 'comedy.Very', 'worthwhile', 'might', 'add.', '10', 'tells', 'music', 'composer', 'George', 'Webber', 'man', 'who', 'obsessed', 'age', 'terrified', 'gotten', 'older', 'Slipping', 'deep', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'repelling', 'ones', 'closest', 'namely', 'girlfriend', 'NOT', 'HIS', 'WIFE', 'Samantha', 'When', 'George', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'bride-to-be', 'Jenny', 'life', 'ignited', 'new', 'passion', 'passion', 'forget', 'age', 'feel', 'young', 'again', 'So', 'throwing', 'caution', 'wind', 'plane', 'Mexico', 'following', 'young', 'bride', 'husband', 'honeymoon', 'Separated', 'George', 'Samantha', 'are', 'given', 'time', 'reflect', 'relationship', 'just', 'where', 'want', 'go.', '10', 'not', 'mindless', 'comedy', 'have', 'accused', 'being', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'head', 'shoulders', 'fact', 'men', 'enter', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'practically', 'go', 'off', 'rocker', 'not', 'far', 'fetched', 'when', 'think', 'it.You', 'have', 'everything', 'going', 'yet', 'have', 'nothing', 'really', 'show', 'so', 'wind', 'up', 'not', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'want.The', 'performances', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'effective', 'times', 'touching', 'moving', 'always', 'hilarious', 'Moore', 'stellar', 'here', 'once', 'again', ""'m"", 'moved', 'say', 'preferred', 'Arthur', 'just', 'loved', 'irresistible', 'comedic', 'timing', 'film', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'opinion', 'not', 'perfect', '10', '11', 'George', 'claims', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'would', 'find', 'attractive', 'thought', 'was', 'somewhat', 'pretty', 'infamous', 'beach', 'scene', 'braids', 'just', 'killed', 'really', 'attractive', 'really', 'star', 'girlfriend', 'well', 'not', 'really', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'mean', 'just', 'scene', 'passion', 'remarkably', 'fearless', 'drive', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quip', 'want', 'argue', 'make', 'love', 'just', 'flawlessly', 'delivered.I', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'think', 'fan', 'cast', 'will', 'too', 'off', 'spots', 'are', 'far', 'few', 'relationship', 'defined', 'George', 'Samantha', 'enlightening', 'say', 'least', 'Also', 'look', 'nice', 'acting', 'turns', 'Robert', 'Webber', 'Dee', 'Wallace', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'who', 'sympathetic', 'bar', 'tender', 'practically', 'scene']",N/A

In fact, I think the script made the film. Of course, Dudley really makes the words to come alive along with his antics. On the other hand, Bo Derek, the real cynosure but not so much of an actress, obviously steals the show with her blue eyes and that hair style, but as soon as her character is revealed as a pothead, there goes the novelty out of the window.

But one day while out for a drive he spies a gorgeous blonde (Who else but Bo Derek?) en route to her wedding, so he follows her to the church and predictably makes a fool out of himself. Undetered by this setback, George embarks on an obsessive quest for this beautiful woman; thus placing further strain on his relationship with his girlfriend, played by Julie ""Goody Two Shoes"" Andrews; which already isn't helped by George's voyeuristic spying on his permanently randy Exhibitionist neighbours through a telescope.Special highlights include the hilarious aftermath of George's first visit to a dentist in years, and of course Bo Derek in THAT swimsuit massaging suntan oil all over her thighs.

The story is about successful composer George Webber (Dudley Moore), who's just turned 40 and feels it.  In the throes of a particularly strong midlife crisis, George sidelines his faithful girlfriend Sam (Julie Andrews) so he may pursue a beautiful mysterious blonde, Jenny (Bo Derek) whom he spies en route to her wedding and can't get out of his head.  George eventually decides to take the plunge and follows Jenny and her husband on their honeymoon.  When Fate intervenes leaving George and Jenny alone with ""Bolero"" blaring on the soundsystem, it seems George's ultimate fantasy will reach it's climax...but what about Sam?Dudley Moore shines as George.  His performance here earned him worldwide acclaim and set off a chain of delightful romantic comedy roles (""Micki and Maude"", ""Arthur"", ""Romantic Comedy"", ""Lovesick"" and a remake of ""Unfaithfully Yours"").  Julie Andrews shook off her squeaky clean image to play the strong-willed and opinionated opera diva Sam (in one scene she actually gives someone The Finger).  Andrews also has some great moments to shine musically, with some lovely Academy Award-nominated songs by Henry Mancini and Robert Wells (""He Pleases Me"", ""It's Easy to Say"").Blake Edwards fills the film with his trademark slapstick comedy and some biting dialogue.

95361,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,0790731045,Craig Connell,"[11, 15]","Boy, this was ""hot stuff"" back when it came out in 1979: I am referring to both the movie AND Bo Derek!Actually, Dudley Moore was a box-office star, too. Nobody had heard of Derek before this, but this film certainly made her an overnight sensation. She didn't have to say anything in the film, just walk down a beach. Certainly, the number ""10"" now had a new meaning in the culture.....and Bo Derek is now a Hollywood icon!Basically, the film is about a guy who spots Derek, and then totally makes a fool of himself over her. Most guys would have done the same thing. Moore, making an idiot of himself as ""George Webber,"" provided a lot of laughs and Bo had to just....well....just let herself be photographed. Fortunately, in real life, she turned out to be far more than just some hot- looking bimbo. I've heard her on several talk shows in recent years, and she's no dummy.....and still looks tremendous. Meanwhile, Moore, who had some tough physical ailments, really didn't have a noteworthy career after this film with one exception: Arthur (1981). The poor man died in 2002.One forgets that a huge big-name actress co-starred with Moore in this movie: Julie Andrews. Perhaps a good part of that reason we forget that is she doesn't play a memorable character. It fact, she's downright unappealing as Moore's girlfriend ""Samantha Taylor.""It's also easy to forget about some of the cultural issues songwriter ""Webber"" dealt with, bemoaning the shallowness of the current generation and its music tastes, and finally realizing his own shallowness won't lead to happiness just by being with a woman half his age. There are some profound things to ponder in this film even though it often concentrates on the slapstick humor angle. As a guy who has gone through the usual ""mid- life"" crisis, I would to sympathize with Webber's dilemmas but since this idiot is drunk half the time and an extremely self-indulgent person, I found it hard to ""root"" for him.

Webber is a wealthy, accomplished & respected musician who has a great many friends and admirers.  There is one problem.  He is in his 40s and begins to experience his mid-life crisis.  He is restless & bored with life.  Although settling in to middle age, he finds that he is still attracted to women in their 20s (a ""problem"" that I myself experience).By chance, he spies a beautiful young woman (played by Bo Derek) who is on her way to her wedding.  She is the most gorgeous creature he has ever seen and he immediately becomes obsessed with her.  This obsession leads to a great many mis-adventures that lead the viewer through the balance of the film.While it is not apparent on the surface, I would characterize 10 as a dark comedy.  It is somewhat morose to think about getting older and no longer being young & vibrant.  The creative ways in which the film differentiates Moore's character from the young lover of Bo Derek's persona are almost creepy.Aside from the tragic loss of youth, the film is also a commentary on the issue of people's personalities not matching their exterior appearance.  While she is beautiful, Bo Derek's character is found to be quit wanting on the personality side of the ledger.  She is shallow and superficial.  Insofar as being a worthwhile person, she can hardly compete with George's girlfriend (portrayed by Julie Andrews).Of all of Blake Edward's films, this one is probably in the top 5.  It is insightful into what troubles we human beings as we grapple with your mortality and the decline of our bodies.  On the upside, there is also some gratuitous nudity, although they could have shown a LOT more of Bo Derek.

These were years in which the woman had to represent the embodiment of the feminism rather than a sex symbol (try for instance to search around these names: Glenda Jackson, Jane Fonda, Julie Christie, Faye Dunaway, Jill Clayburgh, Vanessa Redgrave, Barbara Sukowa and Hanna Schygulla one of the two most exceptional European actresses by then), literally became epic women, relegating unforgettable names of the feminine beauty like Catherine Deneuve, Isabel Adjani, Jacqueline Bissett, Candice Bergen in the other side of the Atlantic. At its moment ""10"" represented certainly a systematic breakthrough in which concerns to what we could say: "" the popular culture"". Not only the spectacular body of Bo Derek, loved and admired by almost the seventy per cent of the men around the world; it was also the irruption of thousand and thousand women around the importance of the sensuality through the fitness; it was a notorious paradigmatic change around the concept of feminine fashion look, trying to emulate the well reminded new hair design exhibited by her along her brief appearance in the film. Fifteen minutes as Andy Warhol expressed once, were quite enough to Bo to steal for herself the title of the sexiest woman in the world since that picture.In this sense the iconic transcendence, shadowed the intrinsic qualities of the film by itself. Dudley Moore was in the top after his success in Arthur and Blake and his cult movie Bedazzled in 1967, while Blake Edwards was by definition a director of evasive proposals in the cinema. But Bo really was the star in this minor but sympathetic film that meant a true renovation around the symbol and the embossment of the woman in the center of the circle of the feminine eternal. Bo Derek achieved such vertiginous peak as sexual symbol easily compared what Marylyn Monroe, Lana Turner, Kim Novak, or Ursula Andress in their respective ages.Finally this film was first rate inspiration for ""the woman in red"" in the following decade.

95368,A1I4WW9TUYEA5Z,0790731045,James R. Williams,"[1, 1]","Blake Edwards's ""10"" is hands down one of the funniest movies ever made. Like the best comedies, it takes common human emotions (undeniable longing and the fear of aging and death in this case) and uses them as a springboard for a series of maniacally hilarious comedic setups and witty observations about the complexity of life, love, and sex. By the time of its release in 1979, Blake Edwards had proven himself an A-list director capable of directing a wide variety of different film genres from romantic comedies (""Breakfast at Tiffany's) to heavy dramas (""Days of Wine and Roses), but his winning streak was beginning to fade. He had achieved enormous commercial success with the first five Pink Panther movies, but his efforts outside the franchise were flops by comparison. With ""10"", Edwards not only achieved the high comedic delirium of the Panther films, but also created a new, more observant kind of comedy that started a ripple effect in pop culture we are still seeing in films today such as Jason Segal's ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" or Judd Apatow's ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"".At the core of the story is a brilliant performance by Dudley Moore whose George Webber, a short forty-two year old musical composer, epitomizes the deepest desires of the human condition. We first see him celebrating yet another birthday surrounded by his longtime lover (Julie Andrews) and a collection of friends. George appears to have everything: a successful career, a perfect house atop a California hillside, and a healthy relationship, but nevertheless the onset of middle age casts a dark shadow over his entire existence. In their collective portrait of George, Edwards and Moore have molded him into the perfect underdog yet we are still able to laugh at him when he falls victim to a slew of random and unsuspected pratfalls. Even after he boards a flight to Mexico to indulge his unbridled infatuation with a beautiful young woman he spied while waiting in afternoon traffic (Bo Derek), the audience is with him on every step of the journey.Also vital to the film's success is the casting of the female leads. Not once do they fall into sentiment or cliche. Bo Derek as Jenny Miles, a.k.a. the ""eleven"" of the picture is sex personified and perpetually luminous. With her nude bathing suit, cornrows, and luscious curves, she takes Jenny far beyond the standard object of lust. In the famous scene where we see her running in slow motion down the beach, she is more like a sexual deity than a brazen temptress. Surprisingly, the reverse is true of Julie Andrews as George's acid-tongued, level-headed mistress. Her Samantha Taylor spouts off a stream of language you would never find in the vocabulary of Mary Poppins or Maria Von Trapp and though she is only featured in a few scenes, her presence can be felt throughout.Rounding out the supporting cast is a collection of fine character actors that include Robert Webber as George's cognitive and shockingly not stereotyped homosexual best friend, a young Dee Wallace as an old acquaintance of George whose self confidence has been bruised by a series of failed relationships, and Brian Dennehy as a warmhearted bartender in Mexico. Something truly magical happens on screen when fantastic acting, superb directing, and deft screenwriting are combined. With all the elements set into place, Edwards has full control over an unhinged plot and the audience is nestled comfortably in the palm of his hand. This is the mark of great filmmaking and that is why ""10"" has remained one of the best.",5,A temptingly tasteful comedy for adults who can count.,1226880000,"11 17, 2008",2008,3547,"['Blake', 'Edwards', '10', 'hands', 'down', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'best', 'comedies', 'common', 'human', 'emotions', 'undeniable', 'longing', 'fear', 'aging', 'death', 'case', 'springboard', 'series', 'maniacally', 'hilarious', 'comedic', 'setups', 'witty', 'observations', 'complexity', 'life', 'love', 'sex', 'time', 'release', '1979', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'had', 'proven', 'A-list', 'director', 'capable', 'directing', 'wide', 'variety', 'different', 'film', 'genres', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Breakfast', 'Tiffany', 'heavy', 'dramas', 'Days', 'Wine', 'Roses', 'winning', 'streak', 'was', 'beginning', 'fade', 'had', 'achieved', 'enormous', 'commercial', 'success', 'first', 'five', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'movies', 'efforts', 'franchise', 'were', 'flops', 'comparison', '10', 'Edwards', 'not', 'only', 'achieved', 'high', 'comedic', 'delirium', 'Panther', 'films', 'also', 'created', 'new', 'more', 'observant', 'kind', 'comedy', 'started', 'ripple', 'effect', 'pop', 'culture', 'are', 'still', 'seeing', 'films', 'today', 'such', 'Jason', 'Segal', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'Judd', 'Apatow', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'core', 'story', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'George', 'Webber', 'short', 'forty-two', 'year', 'old', 'musical', 'composer', 'deepest', 'desires', 'human', 'condition', 'first', 'see', 'celebrating', 'yet', 'birthday', 'surrounded', 'longtime', 'lover', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'collection', 'friends', 'George', 'have', 'everything', 'successful', 'career', 'perfect', 'house', 'California', 'hillside', 'healthy', 'relationship', 'nevertheless', 'onset', 'middle', 'age', 'dark', 'shadow', 'entire', 'existence', 'collective', 'portrait', 'George', 'Edwards', 'Moore', 'have', 'molded', 'perfect', 'underdog', 'yet', 'are', 'still', 'able', 'laugh', 'when', 'victim', 'slew', 'random', 'unsuspected', 'pratfalls', 'Even', 'flight', 'Mexico', 'indulge', 'unbridled', 'infatuation', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'spied', 'waiting', 'afternoon', 'traffic', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'audience', 'step', 'journey.Also', 'vital', 'film', 'success', 'casting', 'female', 'leads', 'Not', 'once', 'do', 'fall', 'sentiment', 'cliche', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'Jenny', 'Miles', 'a.k.a', 'eleven', 'picture', 'sex', 'personified', 'perpetually', 'luminous', 'nude', 'bathing', 'suit', 'cornrows', 'luscious', 'curves', 'Jenny', 'far', 'standard', 'object', 'lust', 'famous', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'running', 'slow', 'motion', 'beach', 'more', 'sexual', 'deity', 'brazen', 'temptress', 'Surprisingly', 'reverse', 'true', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'George', 'acid-tongued', 'level-headed', 'mistress', 'Samantha', 'Taylor', 'stream', 'language', 'would', 'never', 'find', 'vocabulary', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Maria', 'Von', 'Trapp', 'only', 'featured', 'few', 'scenes', 'presence', 'can', 'be', 'felt', 'throughout.Rounding', 'supporting', 'cast', 'collection', 'fine', 'character', 'actors', 'include', 'Robert', 'Webber', 'George', 'cognitive', 'shockingly', 'not', 'stereotyped', 'homosexual', 'best', 'friend', 'young', 'Dee', 'Wallace', 'old', 'acquaintance', 'George', 'self', 'confidence', 'been', 'bruised', 'series', 'failed', 'relationships', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'warmhearted', 'bartender', 'Mexico', 'Something', 'truly', 'magical', 'happens', 'screen', 'when', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'superb', 'directing', 'deft', 'screenwriting', 'are', 'combined', 'elements', 'set', 'place', 'Edwards', 'full', 'control', 'unhinged', 'plot', 'audience', 'nestled', 'comfortably', 'palm', 'hand', 'mark', 'great', 'filmmaking', 'why', '10', 'remained', 'one', 'best']",N/A

His fantasy comes to fruition, after Moore saves Bo Derek's husband from drowning.Given his chance, Webber realizes quickly that Derek's having sex is little more than George scribbling a few notes on a music scale. So, the search was all for naught after all, and Webber returns home to a forgiving Andrews. It's a good movie, but it seems to lack balance.

95376,A25JH6CO4DVINS,0790731045,Junglies,"[8, 10]","Buying this DVD shortly after the unfortunate demise of Dudley Moore brings home how little of the artists work is currently available on DVD and CD.Growing up in England in the 1960s in England it was hard to miss the revolution that was taking place in comedy as well as in other areas of the arts. Dudley Moore was an integral part of that revolution along with his friend and colleague Peter Cook. Sadly much of their recorded output is no longer available. Even sadder is the growing number of those performers who were part of that revolution who are no longer with us.10 is the story of a wealthy composer who has everything that money can buy and a long-suffering girlfriend played by Julie Andrews who has a mind of her own.Moore sees Derek, in her first starring role, and pursues her through a series of misunderstandings from the moment he first sees her on her way to a wedding to finally being alone with her in her hotel room where he discovers her to be a hedonist only seeking self-gratification.The movie is notable for the consideable degree of nudity and for it's moralising on the relaxed social attitudes, if in fact there were any, following on from the nineteen sixties social revolution. There is a moralising tone throughout as we follow Dudley's escapades and although there are a number of humourous situations it is hard to tell whether it was intended as a comedy or whether there was a more dramatic intent.It is nevertheless a warm nice movie and in some ways is more representative of Dudley Moore the person than his other silver screen appearances. Bo Derek gives a faultless performance as the pleasure seeking girl but that is all her role is limited to. Julie Andrews will forever remain to me the way she was in the Sound of Nusic and that is all I can say about it.This DVD is a pleasant way to remember Dudley Moore. He would be better remembered if his catalogue of films and music were once again to be made available for public pleasure and enjoyment.",3,Pleasant little outing for Dudley Moore and Bo Derek,1017792000,"04 3, 2002",2002,1995,"['Buying', 'DVD', 'shortly', 'unfortunate', 'demise', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'home', 'how', 'little', 'artists', 'work', 'currently', 'available', 'DVD', 'CD.Growing', 'up', 'England', '1960s', 'England', 'was', 'hard', 'miss', 'revolution', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'areas', 'arts', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'was', 'integral', 'part', 'revolution', 'friend', 'colleague', 'Peter', 'Cook', 'Sadly', 'much', 'recorded', 'output', 'no', 'longer', 'available', 'Even', 'sadder', 'growing', 'number', 'performers', 'who', 'were', 'part', 'revolution', 'who', 'are', 'longer', 'us.10', 'story', 'wealthy', 'composer', 'who', 'everything', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'long-suffering', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'who', 'mind', 'own.Moore', 'sees', 'Derek', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'series', 'misunderstandings', 'moment', 'first', 'way', 'wedding', 'finally', 'being', 'alone', 'hotel', 'room', 'where', 'be', 'hedonist', 'only', 'seeking', 'self-gratification.The', 'movie', 'notable', 'consideable', 'degree', 'nudity', 'moralising', 'relaxed', 'social', 'attitudes', 'fact', 'were', 'following', 'nineteen', 'sixties', 'social', 'revolution', 'moralising', 'tone', 'follow', 'Dudley', 'escapades', 'are', 'number', 'humourous', 'situations', 'hard', 'tell', 'was', 'intended', 'comedy', 'was', 'more', 'dramatic', 'intent.It', 'nevertheless', 'warm', 'nice', 'movie', 'ways', 'more', 'representative', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'person', 'other', 'silver', 'screen', 'appearances', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'faultless', 'performance', 'pleasure', 'seeking', 'girl', 'role', 'limited', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'will', 'forever', 'remain', 'way', 'was', 'Sound', 'Nusic', 'can', 'say', 'it.This', 'DVD', 'pleasant', 'way', 'remember', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'remembered', 'catalogue', 'films', 'music', 'were', 'once', 'again', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'public', 'pleasure', 'enjoyment']",N/A
95377,A1OBJ2263JCK5,0790731045,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[12, 14]","Blake Edward's film ""10"" is probably among one of the funniest movies to come out of the 1970's.It is both a celebration and condemnation of the sexual antics (post pill/pre-aids)of our society during the ""Me Decade"".In the story, Dudley Moore (in one of his best roles)plays George Webber, a Burt Bachrach style composer, who seems to have everything including wealth, fame, talent and a wonderful girlfriend (marvelously played by Julie Andrews). Unfortunately George has just celebrated his 42nd birthday and is having a huge mid-life crisis.He does this by fixating on a just married beauty(played by the ravishing Bo Derek)who is the ""10"" of the film's title.George, hilariously chases her down to a Mexican vacation resort, where he learns the lesson, that one must be careful, what one wishes for.The ""10"" might be a beautiful girl, but she is ultimately an empty person, who lives for nothing more then self-gratification. This is a really funny movie farce that seems to give us a little of everything.The scenes of physical slapstick probably can only be rivaled by Blake's own ""Pink Panther"" movies.The dialogue is witty and delivered with the best of comic timing.But what ultimately makes this movie is the performances by Dudley Moore and Julie Andrews.Both actors play their characters with both heart and emotion. These two have such a wonderful chemistry together (even when they are fighting) that you wonder how Moore's character can even have such an idiotic mid-life crisis.Finally, I must mention the movie's funniest scene and it's use use of Ravel's 'Bolero'. In the scene, Moore tries to seduce the beautiful Derek, who infuriatingly insists, that he keep re-starting the ""mood music"". Never has a piece of classical music been put to such comic effect.It led to the real life '70s fad of using 'Bolero'as ""make-out music"".

I had no idea what the movie was about until I saw it for the first time as an adult.  Sometimes I still wonder what it's about, but for different reasons.Dudley Moore plays George, a middle aged man who seems to have everything he wants or needs.  A successful career, friends, material things, and a girlfriend played by Julie Andrews.  He is, however, in the proverbial midlife crisis.  Now that I have all these things, am I really happy?  He happens upon those sexy parties across the way from him, watching them through his telescope of the young, beautiful people frolicing in the swimming pool and having a great, naughty time.  He wishes he too had the freedom (not to mention the courage) to be with them or one of them.  One day he happens to see Bo Derek on the way to her wedding at a local church, and becomes obsessed with this mysterious stranger.  He chases her to the island resort where she is spending her honeymoon and gets his big opportunity to cheat.Bo proves herself to be a vaccum, a cute little creampuff of a woman who couldn't and doesn't stimulate him outside of the bedroom.  Unfortunatly, I have seen this happen more times than I care to think about.  Although Bo is far from trash, she represents the kind of woman that a man thinks he wants : airheaded.  Men would rather have trash than a good woman or someone who is their equal.  How many times have I been dumped by good and bad men in my lifetime who would rather have that sexy little number (age nonewithstanding) they can't get their minds off of?  And how many of them were disappointed with their choices?  I always thought the older I got that the more mature men would become, and time and again they drop a good woman like a bad habit because they want to see what else is out there.  Sorry if that sounds bitter, but I've seen too much and experienced too much to be anything but cynical.  But, I believe in love, and love is always worth one more try.

In addition, I secretly wanted a better glimpse of those butt naked &quot;9's&quot;  that (Peeping Tom) Dudley had located via telescope.  Although sometimes heralded as a &quot;mindless comedy&quot;, any movie featuring the exploits of an uninhibited Dudley Moore character (especially one going through a mid life crisis) is bound to have some priceless moments. Moore provides delightful hysterics, especially as a pick up artist with a novocain-numbed mouth at the local coffee shop.  His less than tragic slide down a hillside, and then scampering back up to catch his wife's (the incomparable Julie Andrews) telephone call (before the emergence of cell phones) is a classic among classic scenes!  But the luster fades as this film moves along, and we are left with just one obvious and bittersweet conclusion: Only the pairing of Moore and Andrews as husband and wife allows the film to reach marginal success.  Bo Derek is beautiful, provacative, enchanting, and a genuine &quot;10&quot; for the role, but her presence is just icing on the cake.  For those of you still wondering about the noise meter level: The sound didn't even register.  For a while, we thought maybe the woman had recently passed, and was just a ghost or apparition.  Then I went back and read the  &quot;technical details&quot; section on amazon.com, only to discover that DVD sound quality was rated a microscopic 1.5!  I will always read technical details BEFORE purchasing the DVD when this situation arises again in the future. ....",3,Cast Gets a &quot;10&quot; But Director Blake Edwards and DVD Stumble!,970444800,"10 2, 2000",2000,1739,"['viewing', 'quot', '10', 'quot', 'VHS', 'family', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'specifically', 'determine', 'noise', 'decibal', 'reading', 'old', 'woman', 'passing', 'gas', 'hear', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'play', 'piano', 'not', 'necessarily', 'order', 'addition', 'secretly', 'wanted', 'better', 'glimpse', 'butt', 'naked', 'quot', '9', 'quot', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'Dudley', 'had', 'located', 'telescope', 'sometimes', 'heralded', 'quot', 'comedy', 'quot', 'movie', 'featuring', 'exploits', 'uninhibited', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'character', 'especially', 'one', 'going', 'mid', 'life', 'crisis', 'bound', 'have', 'priceless', 'moments', 'Moore', 'delightful', 'hysterics', 'especially', 'pick', 'up', 'artist', 'novocain-numbed', 'mouth', 'local', 'coffee', 'shop', 'less', 'tragic', 'slide', 'down', 'hillside', 'then', 'scampering', 'back', 'catch', 'wife', 'incomparable', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'telephone', 'call', 'emergence', 'cell', 'phones', 'classic', 'classic', 'scenes', 'luster', 'film', 'along', 'are', 'left', 'just', 'one', 'obvious', 'bittersweet', 'conclusion', 'Only', 'pairing', 'Moore', 'Andrews', 'husband', 'wife', 'film', 'reach', 'marginal', 'success', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'beautiful', 'provacative', 'enchanting', 'genuine', 'quot', '10', 'quot', 'role', 'presence', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', 'still', 'wondering', 'noise', 'meter', 'level', 'sound', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'register', 'while', 'thought', 'maybe', 'woman', 'had', 'recently', 'passed', 'was', 'just', 'ghost', 'apparition', 'Then', 'went', 'back', 'read', 'quot', 'technical', 'details', 'quot', 'section', 'amazon.com', 'only', 'discover', 'DVD', 'sound', 'quality', 'was', 'rated', 'microscopic', '1.5', 'will', 'always', 'read', 'technical', 'details', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'when', 'situation', 'again', 'future']",N/A

Film fans may be unaware that Moore scored several films and performed as a concert pianist in his career in addition to his  acting talents.Moore plays a fortyish  songwriter who has developed the  mother of all mid-life crisis's. Julie Andrews (who looks fantastic here  BTW) shines as his impatient love interest and Bo Derek is lovely as  Dudley's fantasy girl. Brian Dennehy and Dee Wallace-Stone are very good in  supporting roles.The DVD transfer is good especially for a film that has  a little age. The sound is mono only which is disappointing but  understandable. This is one of Blake Edwards best films and a must see for  fans of romantic comedy. It is sad and sobering to realize that both  Moore's and Andrew's gifts have been diminished by illness. Grab this DVD  and take time to remember how really talented they both are.",5,Five Stars for Dudley and Julie,956620800,"04 25, 2000",2000,938,"['10', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'five', 'star', 'performance', 'two', 'fronts', 'comic', 'music', 'genius', 'Film', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'unaware', 'Moore', 'scored', 'several', 'films', 'performed', 'concert', 'pianist', 'career', 'addition', 'acting', 'talents.Moore', 'fortyish', 'songwriter', 'who', 'developed', 'mother', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'who', 'fantastic', 'here', 'BTW', 'impatient', 'love', 'interest', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'lovely', 'Dudley', 'fantasy', 'girl', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Dee', 'Wallace-Stone', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'supporting', 'roles.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'good', 'especially', 'film', 'little', 'age', 'sound', 'mono', 'only', 'disappointing', 'understandable', 'one', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'best', 'films', 'must', 'see', 'fans', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'sad', 'sobering', 'realize', 'Moore', 'Andrew', 'gifts', 'have', 'been', 'diminished', 'illness', 'Grab', 'DVD', 'take', 'time', 'remember', 'how', 'really', 'talented', 'are']",N/A
