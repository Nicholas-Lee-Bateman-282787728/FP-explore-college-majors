Over the decades I have known people who will only watch through the Adam era, or who will stick through Candy's original run, but won't watch the Jaimie years of the 1970's, but I believe the entire series is great. I've bought these first five seasons, and have been thrilled with the extras on the four seasons I have received, and the fact that CBS has released full seasons on the same day. I have watched the ""lost episodes"" on cable (from the latter part of the show's run, and been impressed with their quality) and baffled to why NBC didn't release them together with the earlier episodes into rerun syndication 40 years ago? Unlike Gunsmoke, which was split into 3 packages for half hour, hour black and white, and hour color, all Bonanza's are an hour in color, and could have been syndicated together. I'm looking forward to the whole show on disc.

Finally, the 5th season set delivers at a price that doesn't break the bank.In 1991, NBC did a tribute to the late Michael Landon's 30+year career with the network. That was the last time I saw pristine prints of the Adam-era Bonanza episodes (albeit clips) grace my television screen.  For decades, all we've seen are blurry, faded 16mm syndication prints that have aired as part of the ""classic 360"" syndication series sold to most TV and cable outlets throughout the country.  This collection takes you back to the 1963-64 television season and treats to you Bonanza, the way it looked when it originally aired on NBC.  Crisp picture, no edits & restored color. I was surprised to see they even included the NBC ""living color"" peacock bumper in front of each episode, plus the vignettes done by Lorne Greene, Dan Blocker, Pernell Roberts & Michael Landon for Chevrolet, the original sponsor.Best of all, Amazon delivers the complete season for a $40.00 pre-order price.
