1056040,ANY46RC9MF6DB,B000NDETLK,"Anne ""Mystery Fan""","[1, 1]","This is such a charming movie, with a perfect cast.Felicity Jones as Catherine is the imaginative heroine who is nave, but not a pushover.  JJ Feild, is charming as Henry Tilney, her suitor from an odd family.  Casey Mulligan, who plays Catherine's friend the two-faced Isabella Thorpe, later became successful in Hollywood.  Liam Cunningham, the rather terrifying General Tilney (Henry's father) played a much more benign suitor to Jane Tennison in Prime Suspect 6.  (Just in case you have the trouble I had in trying to identify him).General Tilney, thinking the ordinary Catherine is wealthy invites her to be the family's guest at their spooky estate, which inspires all sorts of Gothic imaginings on Catherine's part of murder, mayhem, and secret rooms hidden at the top of the stairs.  Luckily, the general doesn't know what Catherine is really thinking, but when he finds out she doesn't have a fortune, he sends her packing.A downcast Catherine returns home, but this being Jane Austen, you can be sure that a besotted Henry soon follows.  Apparently a small scene has been omitted, which is too bad because I would have liked the movie to be longer.  Even so, this is a light and charming Jane Austen souffle, which I thoroughly enjoyed.My only objection is mild and has to do with wardrobe.  In order to show Catherine as the nave country girl and Isabella as the sophisticated city dweller,  Catherine is dressed in rather dowdy dresses with nondescript hats, while Isabella is clothed in beautifully styled gowns and bouffant bonnets.  It's disconcerting because Catherine is the heroine and should have our attention, and unnecessary since Mrs. Allen is clothes conscious and responsible for helping to pick Catherine's wardrobe. Catherine has less money than the Allens, (as does Isabella) but even within a budget, she could pick more attractive clothing.",4,Spooky Charmer in Time for Halloween,1349222400,"10 3, 2012",2012,1870,"['such', 'charming', 'movie', 'perfect', 'cast.Felicity', 'Jones', 'Catherine', 'imaginative', 'heroine', 'who', 'nave', 'not', 'pushover', 'JJ', 'Feild', 'charming', 'Henry', 'Tilney', 'suitor', 'odd', 'family', 'Casey', 'Mulligan', 'who', 'Catherine', 'friend', 'two-faced', 'Isabella', 'Thorpe', 'later', 'became', 'successful', 'Hollywood', 'Liam', 'Cunningham', 'rather', 'terrifying', 'General', 'Tilney', 'Henry', 'father', 'played', 'much', 'more', 'benign', 'suitor', 'Jane', 'Tennison', 'Prime', 'Suspect', '6', 'Just', 'case', 'have', 'trouble', 'had', 'trying', 'identify', '.General', 'Tilney', 'thinking', 'ordinary', 'Catherine', 'wealthy', 'be', 'family', 'guest', 'spooky', 'estate', 'sorts', 'Gothic', 'imaginings', 'Catherine', 'part', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'secret', 'rooms', 'hidden', 'top', 'stairs', 'Luckily', 'general', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Catherine', 'really', 'thinking', 'when', 'out', ""n't"", 'have', 'fortune', 'packing.A', 'downcast', 'Catherine', 'home', 'being', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'besotted', 'Henry', 'soon', 'Apparently', 'small', 'scene', 'been', 'omitted', 'too', 'bad', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'be', 'longer', 'Even', 'so', 'light', 'charming', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'souffle', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed.My', 'only', 'objection', 'mild', 'do', 'wardrobe', 'order', 'show', 'Catherine', 'nave', 'country', 'girl', 'Isabella', 'sophisticated', 'city', 'dweller', 'Catherine', 'dressed', 'rather', 'dowdy', 'dresses', 'nondescript', 'hats', 'Isabella', 'clothed', 'beautifully', 'styled', 'gowns', 'bouffant', 'bonnets', 'disconcerting', 'Catherine', 'heroine', 'should', 'have', 'attention', 'unnecessary', 'Mrs.', 'Allen', 'clothes', 'conscious', 'responsible', 'helping', 'pick', 'Catherine', 'wardrobe', 'Catherine', 'less', 'money', 'Allens', 'Isabella', 'even', 'budget', 'could', 'pick', 'more', 'attractive', 'clothing']",N/A

The actress playing Catherine Morland was very close to how I pictured the character to be.  The actor playing Henry Tilney was actually handsome and charming, something the previous actor in the role definitely was not.  It was amusing seeing Sylvestra Le Touzel (my apologies if I spelled her name wrong), the Fanny Price from the old BBC version of Mansfield Park, as Mrs. Allen.  She was also good in the part.  I also found the little fantasy sequences from Catherine's novel reading to be very amusing.I do have a few complaints about this version.  One is that it was too short. Some of the action felt a bit rushed and I found myself explaining a lot of things to my husband, who has not read the book.  Secondly, I would have preferred it if the writer had used a bit more of Jane Austen's dialogue from the book.  I could not believe they left out the best lines, ""I cannot speak well enough to be unitelligible."" ""Bravo!-an excellent satire on modern language.""

1056047,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000NDETLK,Byron Kolln,"[4, 4]","The most deliciously featherlight of Jane Austen's novels, NORTHANGER ABBEY combines the authors' signature class observations with a parody of the penny-thrillers which were the secret guilty pleasure for many during the era.  This version, broadcast in 2007 as part of a special season of new Jane Austen dramatisations for ITV, will satisfy those who didn't care for the BBC's 1987 attempt, which has divided Austen-philes for years.Eighteen-year-old Catherine Morland (Felicity Jones) leaves her family's country home to stay with old friends Mr and Mrs Allen for a holiday in Bath.  There, Catherine's innocent demeanour attracts the attention of warm-hearted Henry Tilney (JJ Feild - ""The Sally Lockhart Mysteries"") and his sister Eleanor (Catherine Walker);  but also falls prey to the subtle manipulations of Isabella Thorpe (Carey Mulligan - ""Bleak House""), a young woman who insists that she cares little for money but whose actions show otherwise.  When Henry's father General Tilney (Liam Cunningham) invites Catherine to travel back with his family to their ancestral estate of Northanger Abbey, Catherine's vivid imagination - fed on a steady diet of pulp fiction gothic thrillers for years - goes into overdrive conjuring up all manner of terrifying family secrets stored within it's walls.This is altogether a far more satisfying screen treatment of Jane Austen's story, and that is mainly due to Andrew Davies' script, which retains a strong flavour of the original novel.  One of the main failings of the 1987 BBC version was a tendency to fight against its source (eg: a bizarre 80's New Age-wannabe soundtrack, several extra characters added for no particular reason).  Period drama fans know they are always in good hands with Andrew Davies (""Vanity Fair"", ""Wives and Daughters"", ""Daniel Deronda"", ""Bleak House"", 2008's ""Sense and Sensibility"", not to mention his magnum opus, the 1995 ""Pride & Prejudice""), but whilst NORTHANGER ABBEY is the one Austen story which can comfortably be retold within the span of a regular movie length, I truly hope that one day we'll see a longer miniseries incarnation.  Saying that, I particularly enjoyed the bookending narration provided by ""Jane Austen"" herself - a charming addition; and Davies has captured the characters with his usual skill.Performances are fantastic.  1987's Katharine Schlesinger was, in my opinion, the strongest component of that otherwise-iffy screen version, but I adored Felicity Jones' performance as Catherine.  She is all you could possibly want and is perfectly-paired with JJ Feild's adorable Henry (Peter Firth he ain't - and that's a good thing here).  Carey Mulligan offers a coy and coolly manipulative Isabella.  Mrs Allen is played with a great comedic flair by Sylvestra Le Touzel - well-known to period drama fans as Fanny Price in the BBC's 1983 miniseries of ""Mansfield Park"", as well as Lady Jane Crawley in Andrew Davies' 1998 ""Vanity Fair"".All in all a charming new NORTHANGER ABBEY.  Buyers should be aware however that the DVD released in the States by PBS/Masterpiece is an edited version which removes several small scenes.

Still, I wanted to see what would happen with this one, and Andrew Davies shows again why he's a master.Catherine here is displayed in all her glory.  Her naviete is evident, but she demonstrates some very great character qualities; her eagerness to think well of people is very sweet, and her loyalty to her brother is beautiful.  Felicity Jones shows very clearly but very properly Catherine's unhappiness and suspicion (even in Catherine Morland!) of Isabella Thorpe's flirtation with Frederick Tilney.  Her sadness and regret when she discovers how easily she's been swayed by her Gothic novel reading is palpable.  The writing is fantastic and Jones carries off the character brilliantly with all the wide-eyed innocence necessary for the role.JJ Feild's Henry Tilney is fantastic.  He's everything that he should be: smart, gentle, upright, friendly, and patient with Catherine.  Tilney's the sort of guy people would have a drink with *and* entrust their children to, and Davies and Feild capture that.  Sorry, Peter Firth, Feild's got you beat on every single count here.I have to mention Carey Mulligan's Isabella Thorpe.  Mulligan plays all that sweet-faced innocence while being a money-grubbing jerk underneath; she's fantastic.  When she gets her comeuppance at Frederick Tilney's hands, it's hard to be sympathetic.  Still, Davies puts in that moment when Frederick Tilney outmaneuvers Isabella and she gets her comeuppance - excellent addition - and Mulligan carries it off brilliantly.  That momentary pathos Mulligan infuses into Isabella really manages to drive home Elinor's warning to Catherine that Isabella will be hurt.Eleanor is lovely - a wonderful, female version of her brother Henry, with all the spirit and gentleness he has.  (They're my favorite brother-sister pair in all of Austen.)  Frederick Tilney is wonderfully rakish.  The Allens are very cute.There are flashes of Davies in the script.  He sort of does the over the top sometimes, and the visualizations of Catherine's Gothic imaginings fit that over-the-top bill.  Still, Davies is a master at catching Austen's humor, and the joke's on Catherine - which he manages to capture with brilliance.Beating the 1986 Maggie Wadey-written ""Northanger Abbey"" isn't a huge feat (sorry, Ms. Wadey), but this version does more than that.

The familiar elements of a Jane Austen are here, along with a surprising dollop of satire.The heroine, young Catherine Morland (played with appropriate wide-eyed innocence by Felicity Jones), a middle class addict of gothic novels, is invited by wealthy family friends Mr. and Mrs. Allen to accompany them to Bath.  Bath is the big city for young Catherine, who is dazzled by the shops, the night life, and the young men.In the course of her travels in Bath with Mrs. Allen and with young friend Isabella, Catherine meets and is almost immediately wooed by two very different gentlemen.  The aggressive and rather obnoxious John Thorpe is brother to Isabella, who shares Catherine's taste in Gothic novels and who is about to become engaged to Catherine's brother.  The Thorpes are under the impression that Catherine's family has money.  The second gentlemen is Henry Tilney, quiet, unassuming, yet witty and with an air of mystery about him.  Henry's father, the dour and forbidding General Tilney, shares the impression that Catherine comes from money.Catherine finds Henry and his sister Elinor to be better company, and is ultimately invited to the family seat of Northanger Abbey, where Henry's mother died a few years earlier.  The air of mystery about the Abbey excites Catherine's already overheated imagination, and she puts at risk her budding relationship with Henry by entering the forbidden chambers of the dead mother.  Her thoughtless act triggers unhappy confrontations with Henry and with General Tilney.  A saddened Catherine returns home, vowing to put Gothic romance behind, only to get another chance at happiness.""Northanger Abbey"" features excellent period costumes and authentic sets.  The movie is fairly brisk at just 90 minutes and seems to be hurrying itself along in the last half hour, during the scenes at Northanger Abbey.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Gothic romances were all the rage in the late 1700s and early 1800s -- and Jane Austen deviated from her usual form for ""Northanger Abbey,"" a mellow satire of the genre. And ""Masterpiece Theatre: Northanger Abbey"" manages to translate it well into a movie, with what seems to be gothic fantasies and scheming set in the middle of a sunlit English countryside.Catherine Morland is an innocent young country girl with a love of gothic romances, and has lives an unremarkably life in a country parish. But then the wealthy Allens invite her to Bath during their vacation there, and of course she accepts -- and through balls and old acquaintances, she becomes friends with two pairs of siblings. One is the Thorpes, the uncouth dandy John and his manipulative sister Isabella, and the more mysterious Tilneys, the charming Henry and sweet Eleanor.When the Tilneys decide to leave Bath, Catherine is invited with them, to the vast stone manorhouse of Northanger Abbey -- which is as gloomy, eerie and remote as her gothic-loving heart could wish for. What's more, she believes that there are dangerous secrets in Northanger Abbey, related to the suspicious death of the late Mrs. Tilney. But Catherine has some lessons to learn about reality and fantasy: that everyday world is not nearly as melodramatic and twisted as her novels, and that it has its own dangers and deceptions.""Masterpiece Theatre: Northanger Abbey"" does an admirable job of adapting Austen's novel, evenly balancing out its two sides -- on one hand it's a parody of all the lurid excesses of classic gothic novels, and on the other it's a subtle coming-of-age tale about a young girl who needs to figure out the difference between reality and fantasy. It has some eerie moments, but most of them seem to be fantasies of Catherine's -- lots of sword fights and dungeons, with her trailing around in a big white gown.It's also beautifully filmed, with ivy-drenched cottages, vast stone castles, grassy yards surrounded by lush trees, and even the pale-lit streets of Bath. It's a stark contrast to the dark, gloomy world that Catherine imagines. And the writers translate Austen's stately prose very well, with some clever dialogue (""Now I must give you one smirk, then we can be rational again"") and some beautifully romantic moments as well (""I told him that I felt myself bound to you, by honor, by affection, and by a love so strong that nothing he could do could deter me..."").It also has some very solid casting -- Felicity Jones projects wide-eyed innocence as Catherine, and she's just pretty enough to be striking without being too much so. JJ Feild is deliciously sexy and just a bit impish as Henry Tilney, and Catherine Walker has a brief but well-acted stint as Isabella, who may be the most naive, clumsy gold-digger in the world. There are also some excellent performances by Catherine Walker (as the gentle, conflicted Eleanor), Liam Cunningham, and William Beck.""Masterpiece Theatre: Northanger Abbey"" is a beautifully filmed, well-acted adaptation of Jane Austen's gently satirical classic, and preserves its spirit admirably.

As long as the adjustments made don't detract from the substantance of the story, I can live with that. Such is the case with this interpretation of Northanger Abbey. The essential story is still there while some omissions did take place such as replacing the Japaned armoire with a common trunk when Katherine finds the laundry lists, a shortcutted way of introducing Eleanor's love interest, and so on. I am glad the digressions to Katherine's fantasy worlds were kept brief or it would have been quite distracting. Felicity Jones was great as Katherine but she has such a youthful appearance - played an 18yr old, looked 14 - that it made her look like a kid sitting at the adult's table. Everyone seemed visually more mature than her, it was a tad distracting. Poor girl will be checked for her ID until well into her 30's! I find no fault with her performance; to the contrary, I thought it superb. The show stopper was Carey Mulligan as the unscrupulous Isabella. My one big regret is that they did not bring the story to conclusion with the reconciliation between Tilney and his father, which was included in the book.

1056078,A3UXZ1AZUS6E02,B000NDETLK,Girl_stuff,"[2, 2]","This production revived my appreciation for Northanger Abbey (admittedly my least favorite Austen novel before). JJ Feild was an amazing Henry Tilney. So much so that my subconscious leaked into a dream one night; whereupon, widowed Elizabeth Darcy finds a love with Henry Tilney (after that ninny Catherine Morland Tilney went mad in an attic - Bront/Jane Eyre style). Excellent dream, what a treat! Henry Tilney (the less heralded Austen hero compared to Darcy) is the male match to our heroine Elizabeth Bennet and you'll see it alive here. I'm really glad Northanger was reinvigorated for me in this production. It's also subtly funny: the glaring Morland kids over a contrite Henry's shoulder, the ridiculously crass John Thorpe, the scheming hyperbole of Isabella Thorpe, ditsy muslin obsessed Ms. Allen, the pompous lothario Captain Tilney, rain soaked and disobliging sheep, gothic imaginings are even parody characters with kick ass sprouting wallpaper segues of a story within the story... I only lament that the PBS version was cut down and edited a little counter-intuitively in bits. Some of my favorite lines in Northanger have disappeared from the dialogue and the lovely narrator (sounded like the mum from Rozema's Mansfield?) could have delivered those Austen-style as in the beginning/ending of Northanger, or thrown us a tied up loose end novel bone? For example: Catherine has 3,000 in her dowry and 150 pounds per year, thrice Elizabeth Bennet's at a time when 7,000 would land you a Baron - that's nothing to cough at (yeah, I'm looking at you, cruel General Tilney) and by Henry's own admission he gets his wish fulfillment to a tolerable degree of both love and a modest fortune (insert romantic, practical flutter instead of worry here)! As with most things Austen, finance of young ladies is an unspoken character with its own story arc. I wish they had taken slightly more time with it - enhance the smart romance? That rhymed, sincere apologies. (@.@) Once in a while, the Tilney/Morland chemistry is confusing, or a little awkward at times, but hey, that's Henry Tilney 'the teasing enigma.' You'll be gratified to know some very swoony bits are in here from pouty, longing looks across opera boxes barely masking jealousy to stolen suggestive leers (in dreams, near fireplaces and in ballrooms) and very steamy cheek swipes after a long horseback ride in the rain before a kiss fest under trees. &lt;Le sigh> At any rate, if you're an Austen fan this version should be in your arsenal along with Paltrow's Emma, Ehle's Pride and Prejudice, Root's Persuasion, O'Connor's Mansfield Park and the illustrious Thompson's Sense and Sensibility (not necessarily in that order). JJ Feild will win you through Henry Tilney after one head tilt and a grinning smirk. He's an acting gem, in big britches period epic especially; even, if he jokes in interviews about ""slipping on cow pats and frilly sleeves that get in your lunch."" To demonstrate, Feild almost single-handedly saved the romcom lampoon 'Austenland' from narcissist actors who lost their audience's perspective in favor of an untethered inside joke/circus bubble of mockery unchecked by a context lazy, immature directorial and editing effort (that I've watched 4 times - hee). Serious points to Feild for rescuing parts of that one, he has the best subdued and credibly funny bits in it even if it could have been utterly phenomenal with more cast and directorial assistance. Feild, who can shine in anything with range and emotive gifts even as an anti-hero/sociopath was kinda squandered by that Austenland/Dynamite crowd, though he totally gets it, delivered wit masterfully, and they chose him expressly ""to take the piss"" because of Northanger. And no, in case you were wondering, I'm not a ""suffocating death by doily"" type gal, but I do read and have an advanced Com Arts degree (with student loans to boot, giggle, dammit). Felicity Jones is a terribly pretty and innocent Catherine Morland - you'll cheer for her through your wincing. Don't kid yourself, it's a skill to blush on demand. Mulligan nailed Isabella in dimples, unseemly cleavage bodices, waffling inconstancy and deeply studied/nuanced motivation - bravo. The costumes, locations and set design deserve their own review. Even the rain gets a supporting role nomination. Blu-ray quality is as good as is available, so I reccommend it because any less would be mostly janky, reticulated pixel terrible on an HD worthy screen. Hello, it's an epic romance worth the extra 3 lousy Federal Reserve Notes of pretty full screen since this charmer isn't available for streaming right now. I'm hoping beyond hope that an extended version becomes available (gracious thanks, but boo PBS!). As an American woman, I'm almost forgiving of Rothschild central banking cartels, cookies called biscuits and re-swelling with diplomatic gratitude for my family peeps having stormed the shores of Normandy with ferocious, Limey allied luv. Who knew? This is definitely one to see, despite my nitpicks, the best NA going and I adore it. I just want to be clear about that.

It's been ""sexed up"" for modern audiences by the inclusion of several fantasy or dream sequences which I found rather obnoxious and disturbing. My young kids were in the room when this movie was on, and it was the only time I've ever been concerned that Austen wasn't suitable for children. The two leads are charming and fun to watch, and the film stays mostly true to the story. I enjoyed it but can't say it's one of my favorites. UPDATE: I was recently given the dvd of this film as a gift, and I was surprised to see that at least one scene which raised my eyebrows a bit (a fantasy/dream scene involving a minister and a bathtub) was not included. I had seen that scene on Masterpiece when the movie originally aired, but it apparently was left out of the US version of the dvd that was bought for me, I think from Amazon.

It is an excellent book for many reasons, especially the story.  So I purchased this production because I saw it was another project of Andrew Davies and I always enjoy his work.  This is another great one!The story centers around our ""heroine"" Catherine Morland who accompanies the wealthy Mr. and Mrs. Allen on their trip to Bath.  Catherine has never been away from home for long periods of time before and this will be her first exposure into society.  She is very naive and innocent but she always tries to do the right thing.  She loves novels and enjoys spending her time reading the popular sensational books of the day such as The Mysteries of Udolpho and The Monk, so she tends to dream a bit like any normal 17 year old young lady.  In Bath is meets a variety of different characters some of them who are not exactly as they seem.  Among them are the charming Henry Tilney, and his kind sister Eleanor. Also she befriends a young woman Isabella Thorpe whose brother John Thrope mistakes her for an heiress.  General Tilney (Henry's father) also falls under this assumption and asks Catherine to accompany them to their home Northanger Abby for a brief stay.  Under these conditions Catherine creates some fanciful suspicions that lead her to some trouble.The acting is fantastic.  J.J Feild shines as Henry Tilney and he captures his outgoing, friendly, funny and charming personality perfectly.  Henry Tilney has always been one of my favorite of Austen's main male characters.  J.J. Feild will certainly find his way into your heart just as Henry Tilney does in the book. Felicity Jones is wonderful as Catherine Morland.  She has her sweet disposition, kind personality, naivety and innocence and makes the audience cheer for her and she learns the hard way that real life is sometimes not so Gothic as her books. Carey Mulligan plays an excellent Isabella Thorpe and she is a real treat to watch in this movie.The one and only problem I had with this whole production was that my favorite line from the book did not make it into the movie.

I was a little nervous about Andrew Davies writing the script, given his tendency to sex things up, but the cast looked really good. And then I saw it...Suffice it to say- I was totally right! Most of the cast was really good, especially JJ Feild as Henry Tilney...but it was really sexed up. Most of this was in the form of Catherine's dreams, but there was something else too. One scene in particular was just plain wrong! Why, Andrew Davies, why? He seemed to interpret the story to be Catherine's sexual awakening. Sorry, I didn't see any of that in the book- it was a comedy! This version has funny moments too, but it's really all the sexed up scenes that bothered me. Davies seemed to have missed the point, but at least not as badly as the 1987 creators did.I wouldn't call this adaptation terrible, or anything. It just wasn't as great as it could have been. It was filmed in Dublin, because I guess they were too cheap to actually go to Bath (yet somehow the 1987 version could afford it? And even Persuasion that was filmed at the same time?) I did like that we got a nice little introduction that was close to what was in the book.

I'm used to at least three hours and feel like I definitely wanted more.Catherine was endearing with her love of books, her sweet face, and her even sweeter manner. Henry was handsome and charming. Together, the two of them were sweet. There was no passion though. I've come to expect longing looks that speak volumes, soulful stares, the brush of a hand that is like a declaration of love.

1056103,A226HIHIVFUPLL,B000NDETLK,Lev Raphael,"[94, 132]","Northanger Abbey is a hard book to adapt because more than the other Austen novels, it relies on the narrative voice, which is an often hilarious satire on the Gothic Romance (The Mysteries of Udolpho, The Romance of the Forest, The Italian especially).  These were books of kidnappings, terror (not horror), dark secrets, castles, storms, brooding heroes and put-upon heroines.  Catherine is not heroine material but she tries to make the materials given to her into a Gothic story.  She fails, but love triumphs.Without knowing these books Austen poked fun at (as opposed to read because she was a closet romantic according to Gillian Anderson's witless intro on PBS), the discovery of ancient laundry lists in a chest has little resonance, and Catherine's suspicions about what happened to Tilney's mother really seem to come out of nowhere in this version.  Gothic romances were full of cloistered, mistreated wives, poisonings, tragic journals discovered by candle light, etc.This adaptation moved much too quickly, compressed events too much, and seemed cheesy in its attempt to give life to her reading.  Worse still, not one of the books she was reading physically looked like a book from the period--this was very annoying, as was the overt sexuality.  Are we so dumb we can't get hints--does it all have to be shoved in our faces?More significantly, the irony of the story disappears and this turns into just another romance about a young girl who goes to Bath blahblahblah.  Yes, there are good choices in casting, but the pace is ridiculous and story-telling suffers.  I suppose the producers think that an American audience is too jaded by thrillers to accept something more leisurely, but without a slower pace, you miss the interplay of characters, the glories of setting, and most of all, the ironic turn of events.All that aside, there are some lovely moments, some charming scenes, and for fans of the period, a fairly decent entry into another time.  For a truly deft handling of Austen, nobody beats Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility--she is utterly true to the original book, its feeling, its style, its tone.

1056108,A2X9AXCWH4MT4I,B000NDETLK,"Marcy G. ""MarcyG""","[393, 413]","This version of Jane Austen's novel ""Northanger Abbey"" is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.  I've seen 3 out of the 4 new adaptations of Jane Austen's novels (""Sense & Sensibility"" will not be broadcast in the UK/US until Jan. 08), and this is - in my opinion - the very best of them all.What the early 80's version of ""Northanger Abbey"" (starring Peter Firth and Katherine Schlesinger) lacked, this version more than makes up for.  NA 07 (as it is fondly known among Janeites) stars newcomers Felicity Jones (Servants), JJ Feild (Nicholas Nickleby, Ruby in the Smoke), William Beck (Robin Hood) and Carey Mulligan (Pride & Prejudice), and British tv and stage veterans Liam Cunningham, Sylvestra LeTouzel ('80s Mansfield Park) and Gerry O'Brien.  Screenplay is by Andrew Davies, who also penned the well-loved and swoon-inducing period drama favorites Pride & Prejudice (1995), Daniel Deronda, Doctor Zhivago (2002 tv version), Middlemarch and Wives & Daughters.  True British period drama fans do not need introduction to him or his work.Those have read the books know the story. For the novice, the story is as follows: young 17-year old Catherine Morland accompanies the wealthy Mr. and Mrs. Allen to Bath for her first introduction to Georgian society. She meets the charming Henry Tilney and gregarious John Thorpe who both vie for her attentions, and befriends John's sister Isabella and Henry's sister Eleanor. She meets General Tilney (Henry's father), who mistakenly takes her for an heiress.  After the whirlwind social life of Bath, she is invited by the Tilneys to their country estate, Northanger Abbey, where - due to the influence of her fondness for gothic novels - she thinks up some fanciful ideas about the General.  She falls in love with Henry, but her fancies and the General's discovery of her family's true social standing land her in trouble and threaten to tear her and Henry apart.This adaptation triumphs in many ways.  Fans of the novels know Henry Tilney as one of the most memorable and well-loved of Jane Austen's heroes. He is charming, outgoing and witty as Mr. Darcy is serious, proud and aloof. Henry as played JJ Feild is aptly charming, handsome and swoon-inducing.  Young and naive Catherine is played perfectly by the delightful, lovely and talented Felicity Jones. JJ and Felicity have an undeniable chemistry that echoes through every scene that they share.  They are - beyond a doubt - perfectly cast.  Also well cast are the lovely Carey Mulligan as the ambitious, shallow Isabella and William Beck is perfectly sleazy as her brother John. Liam Cunningham adds a certain gravity to the role of the imperious General Tilney while Sylvestra Le Touzel and Julia Dearden are endearing and often funny as the flighty Mrs. Allen and maternal Mrs. Morland.The screenplay blends romance, satire, humor and drama perfectly while still staying true to Jane Austen's novel.  The costumes and production values are top-notch. The only things I could really find fault on was that I wish ITV had made this into a 2 or 3 hour miniseries (instead of only 1.5 hours) and that Bath was actually used for the Bath locations.  Viewers like me who have actually been to Bath will be able to tell the difference.  And there is certainly enough material in Ms. Austen's novel to warrant a longer running time.Nevertheless, this is an excellent period drama and is rightly one of the best Jane Austen adaptations since the 1995 versions of Pride & Prejudice, Persuasion and Sense & Sensibility (though I also admit a fondness for Pride & Prejudice 2005 & 1980, and Emma (with Gwyneth Paltrow)).  Of the 3 recent adaptations that will be shown in Masterpiece Theater in 2008, this is my favorite.  ""Persuasion"" comes next, and ""Mansfield Park"" comes last. Time will tell how the new version of ""Sense & Sensibility"" will compare to these three. As it stands, however, ""Northanger Abbey"" is an absolute gem and a crowd-pleaser that is sure to delight period drama fans. I trust that female (and some male) viewers will become a JJ Feild fans after they see this.",5,The best of the recent Jane Austen adaptations.

I watched this movie before I read the book, because I expected the movie would disappoint me, and I knew I would be constantly comparing if I watched it after reading Ms. Austen's masterpiece. However, reading the book afterwards, I was pleasantly surprised by how close to the book the movie really is. The only differences are, of course, the imagined dream sequences and proposal scene, and slight variations towards beginning and towards the end. I thought the dream sequences were very clever and worked with Catherine's character. As to the other liberties taken, they were minor and/or accurate with what I think Ms. Austen would envision.

This is especially meaningful concerning a PBS rendering of a classic author like Jane Austen.  Did the screenwriter and director make a weaker movie by altering the story in a meaningful way?  In this case, I think foolish mistakes were made probably because the director wanted to make his mark and satisfy his ego.  The result is a watchable and even enjoyable film which could easily have been much better.This version is actually less true to the book than the 80's version.  For example, showing Catherine running back to the Tilney house when she catches John Thorpe in a lie about her previous plans with the Tilneys being cancelled is not only left out but the entire scene is altered.  Well, Jane Austen put it there as a crucial proof of Catherine's character at this stage of the book or movie.  Stupidly left out...  Also left out is the full characterization of Tilney and Catherine- all they had to do is follow Jane Austen's lead as the 80's version did... instead they truncated the dialogue- again very dumb especially unforgivable because they had the 80's version to look at and recognize how important it is to the integrity of the story.What this version does do better than the 80's version is the casting of Felicity Jones as Catherine, someone Henry Tilney would find extremely attractive both physically and for her simplicity and integrity- she is quite perfect.  In addition, the 80's version ended the movie awkwardly while the newer version is excellent.Thus the newer version is somewhat better than the earlier version for the above reasons but watch both and enjoy.A word of caution- you may want to ignore the ethereal new age music of the 80's and the phony echos of the newer version- both pretty poorly done and a sign of production weaknesses.",3,Good but could be substantially better,1340409600,"06 23, 2012",2012,1906,"['movie', 'not', 'have', 'follow', 'book', 'changes', 'are', 'made', 'should', 'be', 'spirit', 'making', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'especially', 'meaningful', 'concerning', 'PBS', 'rendering', 'classic', 'author', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Did', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'make', 'weaker', 'movie', 'altering', 'story', 'meaningful', 'way', 'case', 'think', 'foolish', 'mistakes', 'were', 'made', 'probably', 'director', 'wanted', 'make', 'mark', 'satisfy', 'ego', 'result', 'watchable', 'even', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better.This', 'version', 'actually', 'less', 'true', 'book', '80', 'version', 'example', 'showing', 'Catherine', 'running', 'back', 'Tilney', 'house', 'when', 'John', 'Thorpe', 'lie', 'previous', 'plans', 'Tilneys', 'being', 'cancelled', 'not', 'only', 'left', 'out', 'entire', 'scene', 'altered', 'Well', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'put', 'there', 'crucial', 'proof', 'Catherine', 'character', 'stage', 'book', 'movie', 'Stupidly', 'left', 'out', 'Also', 'left', 'out', 'full', 'characterization', 'Tilney', 'Catherine-', 'had', 'do', 'follow', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'lead', '80', 'version', 'did', 'instead', 'truncated', 'dialogue-', 'again', 'very', 'dumb', 'especially', 'unforgivable', 'had', '80', 'version', 'look', 'recognize', 'how', 'important', 'integrity', 'story.What', 'version', 'do', 'better', '80', 'version', 'casting', 'Felicity', 'Jones', 'Catherine', 'someone', 'Henry', 'Tilney', 'would', 'find', 'extremely', 'attractive', 'physically', 'simplicity', 'integrity-', 'quite', 'perfect', 'addition', '80', 'version', 'ended', 'movie', 'awkwardly', 'newer', 'version', 'excellent.Thus', 'newer', 'version', 'somewhat', 'better', 'earlier', 'version', 'above', 'reasons', 'watch', 'enjoy.A', 'word', 'caution-', 'may', 'want', 'ignore', 'ethereal', 'new', 'age', 'music', '80', 'phony', 'echos', 'newer', 'version-', 'pretty', 'poorly', 'done', 'sign', 'production', 'weaknesses']",N/A

In my opinion, Jane Austen wrote ""Northanger Abbey"" as a humorous dipiction of old gothic novels and their effect on an innocent mind; however, it seems the producer/script writer of this piece didn't agree.First of all, in the book, Catherine does not begin reading novels until she meets Isabella in Bath. Her character is completely wrong! She is intended as a simple, innocent girl- not clever, but certainly not dumb. Here, she seems occasionally too clever, overly imaginative, and in an attempt to appear naive, she almost constantly leaves her mouth hanging open.Henry Tilney, on the cover, looks very Henry-ish. Not so on the screen. May have been good, if they had left Jane Austen's dialogue intact. He lacked all cleverness, charm, and humor.Eleanor Tilney looked more suited to be Henry's mother than sister, and the Allens' were bufoonish, very badly done.Austen's humor was completely lost in this badly acted, badly written adaptation of her novel. Over all, the air of this film was too modern. The actors' didn't have any of the propriety of address needed to convey an authentic feeling of the time period. Not what we expected from Andrew Davies, as he usually captures Austen's wit and emotion very nicely.

""Northanger Abbey"" is arguably Jane Austen's breeziest, most light-hearted novel, and this BBC adapation gets the tone and subject just right. In fact, it's hard to imagine how this production could be bettered.  It joins Emma Thompson's interpretation of ""Sense and Sensibility,"" the Gwyneth Paltrow/Jeremy Northam version of ""Emma"" and the BBC Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle ""Pride and Prejudice"" in most accurately capturing Jane Austen's characters and world.Felicity Jones triumphs in the role of Catherine Morland, a good-hearted but naive girl who learns not to let her imagination--or her gullibility--misinterpret people or situations. Ingenues are often unbearably simpering or one-dimensional, but Jones brings so much humor, sweetness, and integrity to the role that we totally understand why discerning clergyman Henry Tilney (a charming JJ Feild) falls for her.The cast, as is generally true of these productions, is uniformly excellent. Catherine Walker gives a particularly affecting performance as Henry's sister Eleanor.  In the subtlest ways--an anxious smile, pressed-together hands, a near-bow--she suggests a young woman both dignified and repressed.  Carey Mulligan also shines as the shallow Isabella, who uses her winsomeness and wiles to secure one man as she seeks out another, richer one. (Screenwriter Andrew Davies takes a major liberty with Isabella's fate, but it is in keeping with her character and makes her subsequent behavior even more telling).I don't know where they find all these wonderfully natural child actors (is great thespianism part of the British DNA?), but the youngsters playing Catherine's siblings are unselfconsciously adorable. They, along with the actors who portray Catherine's likeable, salt-of-the-earth parents, really give an impression of a secure and happy household.The music by Charlie Mole deserves a special nod. The violin theme that plays when Henry and Catherine ride out together is achingly beautiful and all too brief.  In fact, the soundtracks from the BBC Austen offerings of about 5 years ago were often the highlights of otherwise iffy productions.  I wish the BBC would come out with a compilation...Catherine's fantasies are amusing, if predictable, as her imagination becomes more and more fevered by reading lurid gothic romances. Without showing too much, they hint at her awakening sexuality (the 1980's version to me is unwatchable, in part because the fantasies shown there are gruesome rather than sensual).""Northanger Abbey"" is the perfect film to watch for a winter pick-me-up.  Or, really, any time you want an hour and a half of undiluted film pleasure.

I was so extremely thankful that someone had FINALLY undertaken to make a new version of Northanger Abbey!  (the 1986 version being so difficult to enjoy)...although I must say I sincerely wish they had undertaken to make a longer version, with less editing of the book, and more accuracy!On a trip to Bath Catherine Morland meets two men who immediately become interested in her romantically: Henry Tilney and John Thorpe.  Felicity Jones as Catherine Morland is a great choice: she is so sweet and innocent and yet imagines such dark and sensual goings on in her dreams as well as during her trip to Northanger Abbey, ancestral home of Henry Tilney (JJ Field).  The wild imaginings and fantasies of Catherine that are sparked by her love of gothic romances (novels), lead her down a path that may change the course of her future!Content: there are some things to be aware of: mild swearing (few uses of d*mn), some cleavage shown, a scene were Catherine dreams of a man coming into her presence while she is in a bath (she takes his hand and leaves the bath), nothing shown; there is a scene where a woman is covered by sheets and it is implied that she and a young man have just had `relations' together; there are mentions of possible schemes & violence, which turn out to be untrue; there is a lot of sexual innuendo, and fantasies of swordfights, etc., but all in all it is kept to a fair minimum.What a nice, new adaptation of Northanger Abbey!  Finally we have a halfway decent adaptation of this book to enjoy on the screen: I give them extra points for this alone, and then have to subtract some for things like the overtly sensual content and the switching of 'Udolpho' for 'The Monk', but really, I am just so pleased to have A VERSION of Northanger Abbey to watch on a regular basis (I'm sorry, I just can't very often stomach the older BBC version in this instance), I can almost forgive anything.

1056141,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,B000NDETLK,Stanley H. Nemeth,"[14, 18]","""Northanger Abbey"" is the Austen novel that has received the least attention from adapters during the Jane Austen craze of this and the last decade. Perhaps the reason is that, even more than the frequently ill-adapted and much greater ""Emma,"" it relies for its genius heavily on the ironic observations of the authorial voice. Without recourse to endless voiceovers, it threatens to devolve into just the standard Regency Gothic romance its witty author was largely bent on parodying. Not surprisingly, such voiceovers are largely missing here. While it is a vast improvement over the 1986 TV production, this adaptation remains as a consequence mostly deficient in capturing the youthful author's satiric wit and charm.Further, Catherine Morland at the outset lacks the clueless nature that is a large part of her attractiveness for Henry Tilney. She sounds more like a would-be Elizabeth Bennet than a good-hearted but amusingly ignorant country girl on a first visit to fashionable Bath. Henry Tilney, in turn, lacks the sprightly wit of the novel's character, emerging as more of a sugarstick than a wonderfully clever clergyman. Catherine complains of his incessant teasing, but any noteworthy, verbally memorable example of such is hard to find. Consequently, their exchanges pretty much fall flat.The adaptation is thematically faithful to the novel in an important way, though: its ironic insight that life IS truly horrible, though not in the manner the heroine expects. True horror in the England of the day doesn't involve ghosts and murdered wives in old abbeys replete with secret passages. It rests rather on ""crimes of the heart,"" here those inspired by a shameless love of money before all else. General Tilney and Isabella Thorpe emerge for this reason as true comic monsters, but of a sort Catherine had least expected to find around her. Still, though, except for the General's shocking eviction of Catherine from Northanger, the treatment of these characters is far too heavy-handed, lacking anything of the ""light, bright, and sparkling"" that gives the novel its witty balance.",3,Doesn't Do Justice To Austen's Wit,1200873600,"01 21, 2008",2008,2099,"['Northanger', 'Abbey', 'Austen', 'novel', 'received', 'least', 'attention', 'adapters', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'craze', 'last', 'decade', 'Perhaps', 'reason', 'even', 'more', 'frequently', 'ill-adapted', 'much', 'greater', 'Emma', 'genius', 'heavily', 'ironic', 'observations', 'authorial', 'voice', 'recourse', 'endless', 'voiceovers', 'devolve', 'just', 'standard', 'Regency', 'Gothic', 'romance', 'witty', 'author', 'was', 'largely', 'bent', 'parodying', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'such', 'voiceovers', 'are', 'largely', 'missing', 'here', 'vast', 'improvement', '1986', 'TV', 'production', 'adaptation', 'consequence', 'mostly', 'deficient', 'capturing', 'youthful', 'author', 'satiric', 'wit', 'charm.Further', 'Catherine', 'Morland', 'outset', 'clueless', 'nature', 'large', 'part', 'attractiveness', 'Henry', 'Tilney', 'more', 'would-be', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'good-hearted', 'amusingly', 'ignorant', 'country', 'girl', 'first', 'visit', 'fashionable', 'Bath', 'Henry', 'Tilney', 'turn', 'sprightly', 'wit', 'novel', 'character', 'emerging', 'more', 'sugarstick', 'wonderfully', 'clever', 'clergyman', 'Catherine', 'complains', 'incessant', 'teasing', 'noteworthy', 'verbally', 'memorable', 'example', 'such', 'hard', 'find', 'Consequently', 'exchanges', 'pretty', 'much', 'fall', 'flat.The', 'adaptation', 'thematically', 'faithful', 'novel', 'important', 'way', 'ironic', 'insight', 'life', 'IS', 'truly', 'horrible', 'not', 'manner', 'heroine', 'True', 'horror', 'England', 'day', ""n't"", 'involve', 'ghosts', 'murdered', 'wives', 'old', 'abbeys', 'replete', 'secret', 'passages', 'rather', 'crimes', 'heart', 'here', 'inspired', 'shameless', 'love', 'money', 'else', 'General', 'Tilney', 'Isabella', 'Thorpe', 'emerge', 'reason', 'true', 'comic', 'monsters', 'sort', 'Catherine', 'had', 'least', 'expected', 'find', 'around', 'Still', 'General', 'shocking', 'eviction', 'Catherine', 'Northanger', 'treatment', 'characters', 'far', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'lacking', 'anything', 'light', 'bright', 'sparkling', 'novel', 'witty', 'balance']",N/A

It is rather hard to review the movie adaptations of Austen's works as too much is lost when the novel is chopped down to fit into a specific time limit, in this case about 90 minutes. But, director Jon Jones has done an admirable job of staying true to the essence of Austen's work without losing too much of its original flavor in cutting out parts of the novel.The casting is well-done - J.J. Feild is consummate as the 'almost handsome' Henry Tilney [though I personally found him to be quite a dish myself]. Felicity Jones plays the role of Catherine Morland to perfection -equal parts naive, and yet able to see through artifice in people. Cary Mulligan as the trampy Isabella Thorpe shows much promise and is very convincing in her role. Liam Cunningham as the mercenary General Tilney makes a compellingly brooding and villanous character. The other roles are suitably cast as well.There is much to commend about this adaptation besides the casting - the musical score captures the gothic feel of the novel, especially  in the fantasy sequences, and the cinematography is gorgeous. The scenes of Northanger Abbey especially truly evoke a romantic and mysterious feel, and credit surely must go to the able camerawork & direction. Considering that Jane Austen was very descriptive about Northanger Abbey in her novel, the particular attention that is paid in 'showing' the viewer the interior and exterior of the building is very much appreciated.Purists will have problems with the liberties taken with the novel, and I do personally feel that this production was unnecessarily sexed-up, but on the whole I do think that this is a much improved adaptation than the 1986 version, and also well-made and acted. I would highly recommend it to all Austen fans and those who love period dramas.",4,"An engaging, improved adaptation with excellent casting.",1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,1963,"['most', 'recent', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'improvement', 'rather', 'cheesy', '[', 'still', 'entertaining', ']', '1986', 'adaptation', 'well-cast', 'rather', 'hard', 'review', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'Austen', 'works', 'too', 'much', 'lost', 'when', 'novel', 'chopped', 'down', 'fit', 'specific', 'time', 'limit', 'case', '90', 'minutes', 'director', 'Jon', 'Jones', 'done', 'admirable', 'job', 'staying', 'true', 'essence', 'Austen', 'work', 'losing', 'too', 'much', 'original', 'flavor', 'cutting', 'out', 'parts', 'novel.The', 'casting', 'well-done', 'J.J.', 'Feild', 'consummate', ""'almost"", 'handsome', 'Henry', 'Tilney', '[', 'personally', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'dish', ']', 'Felicity', 'Jones', 'role', 'Catherine', 'Morland', 'perfection', '-equal', 'parts', 'naive', 'yet', 'able', 'see', 'artifice', 'people', 'Cary', 'Mulligan', 'trampy', 'Isabella', 'Thorpe', 'much', 'promise', 'very', 'convincing', 'role', 'Liam', 'Cunningham', 'mercenary', 'General', 'Tilney', 'compellingly', 'brooding', 'villanous', 'character', 'other', 'roles', 'are', 'suitably', 'cast', 'well.There', 'much', 'commend', 'adaptation', 'casting', 'musical', 'score', 'gothic', 'feel', 'novel', 'especially', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'scenes', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'especially', 'truly', 'evoke', 'romantic', 'mysterious', 'feel', 'credit', 'surely', 'must', 'go', 'able', 'camerawork', 'direction', 'Considering', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'was', 'very', 'descriptive', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'novel', 'particular', 'attention', 'paid', ""'showing"", 'viewer', 'interior', 'exterior', 'building', 'very', 'much', 'appreciated.Purists', 'will', 'have', 'problems', 'liberties', 'taken', 'novel', 'do', 'personally', 'feel', 'production', 'was', 'unnecessarily', 'sexed-up', 'whole', 'do', 'think', 'much', 'improved', 'adaptation', '1986', 'version', 'also', 'well-made', 'acted', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Austen', 'fans', 'who', 'love', 'period', 'dramas']",N/A
