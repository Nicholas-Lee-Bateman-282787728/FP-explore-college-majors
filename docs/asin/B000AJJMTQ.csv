927005,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000AJJMTQ,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[7, 8]","Ghost Stories caught me off guard. I was expecting an anime aimed at children with a few morals sprinkled in between the moments that bring easy chills (graphically drawn monsters, characters in paril). Yet it really had nothing to do with either of the above. Firstly, it's obviously not meant for scares. Secondly, I wouldn't let any child below the teenage years watch this, as the children in this anime curse (not graphic), talk about lesbianism, and have a few religiously based jokes.What do I mean by it's not meant for scares? Well, that's easy. This anime is hilarious. It has plenty of funny one-liners (it has a Family Guy quote) and an odd collection of characters. The two main characters lost their mother and now have to put up with an over-protective father, and they just so happen to have a possessed cat. There's the everyday playboy with his nerdy ghost-expert friend. And finally, and probably the most hilarious of all the characters, there's the born-again Christian who constantly spouts her faith, especially when it really isn't needed.Though I haven't gotten too deep into the story itself, it seems that most of the trouble surrounds an old school house where, on their first day of school, the two main characters end up getting lost in while looking for their cat. A lot of the creatures/ghosts, whatever, that show up are obviously exaggerations on some of the Japanese myths, and none of them actually have a scary look to them. They just add to the spontaneous hilarity of the jokes.It's difficult to categorize this anime. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys slapstick comedy such as what is found in Slayers and Sorcerer Hunters. I would also recommend it for its simple uniqueness. I've yet to find an anime that has caught my attention like Ghost Stories has.",5,Obviously Not Meant to Scare,1131494400,"11 9, 2005",2005,1805,"['Ghost', 'Stories', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'was', 'expecting', 'anime', 'aimed', 'children', 'few', 'morals', 'sprinkled', 'moments', 'bring', 'easy', 'chills', 'graphically', 'drawn', 'monsters', 'characters', 'paril', 'really', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'above', 'Firstly', 'obviously', 'not', 'meant', 'scares', 'Secondly', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'child', 'teenage', 'years', 'watch', 'children', 'anime', 'curse', 'not', 'graphic', 'talk', 'lesbianism', 'have', 'few', 'religiously', 'based', 'jokes.What', 'do', 'mean', 'not', 'meant', 'scares', 'Well', 'easy', 'anime', 'hilarious', 'plenty', 'funny', 'one-liners', 'Family', 'Guy', 'quote', 'odd', 'collection', 'characters', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'lost', 'mother', 'now', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'over-protective', 'father', 'just', 'so', 'happen', 'have', 'possessed', 'cat', 'everyday', 'playboy', 'nerdy', 'ghost-expert', 'friend', 'finally', 'probably', 'most', 'hilarious', 'characters', 'born-again', 'Christian', 'who', 'constantly', 'faith', 'especially', 'when', 'really', ""n't"", 'needed.Though', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'too', 'deep', 'story', 'most', 'trouble', 'old', 'school', 'house', 'where', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'lost', 'looking', 'cat', 'lot', 'creatures/ghosts', 'whatever', 'show', 'up', 'are', 'obviously', 'exaggerations', 'Japanese', 'myths', 'none', 'actually', 'have', 'scary', 'look', 'just', 'add', 'spontaneous', 'hilarity', 'jokes.It', 'difficult', 'categorize', 'anime', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'such', 'what', 'found', 'Slayers', 'Sorcerer', 'Hunters', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'simple', 'uniqueness', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'find', 'anime', 'caught', 'attention', 'Ghost', 'Stories']",N/A

927007,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000AJJMTQ,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","Before I watched the first episode of GHOST STORIES, I was hoping that this film would be different.I don't know how many times I have watched a Japanese drama or anime where young school students go against the demons and monsters that are haunting their school.When I started watching GHOST STORIES,  I learned quickly that the anime dialogue is no way connected to the original Japanese series.As the characters started talking about Rev. Al Sharpton and Tom Cruise and Satsuki ribbing on her brother and calling him retarded because of his lack of speaking well when excited.  I was definitely surprised.What essentially happened was ADR director Steve Fosterrewrote the dialogue for this anime and did an improvisational adaption for it.Foster brought in the best voice talent in anime (Chris Patton, Christine Auten, Greg Ayres, Hilary Haag, Illich Guardiola, Monica Rial and Rob Mungle) and took an anime that could have been uber-crappy and made it into a hillarious comedy.The main storyline of GHOST STORIES features the adventures of new student Satsuki and her crybaby brother.The two children, pet cat and their father move to the city of where their mother and father first met.Through unfortunate circumstances, the two end up going inside a closed, haunted school as they try to find their cat.Fortunately, they have the help of their neighbor Hajime and his nerdy Jewish friend and also the help from girl who is a hardcore born again Christian.The kids learn that Satsuki's mother was a principal at the school and left a book on how to seal the monsters.Thus the kids become somewhat of a Team Ghostbusters and as for that missing cat, it appears they accidentally sealed the demon in their pet cat.The voice acting in this anime is top notch and to hear them improvise and come up with hilarious dialogue is just impressive.A lot of the improvisation that we have seen in the past were usually featured on  the DVD special features ala outtakes.So, it's an understatement at the last, when actual episodes feature this improv acting.  It's so surreal.Sure, the animation may not be all that great and I was told that the original Japanese dialogue was not all that exciiting.  So, for ADV to really do something this different is awesome and absolutely hillarious!As for the DVD, the final release (October 25) will feature 4 episodes (100 minutes) with special features such as a ""ghost profiles"" with background on Japanese folktales, clean opening and closing animation and more.I'm not sure if this will start a trend for comedic improv acting for voice dubs in anime series but if it does happen, I'm definitely buying it!  I highly recommend checking GHOST STORIES out.",4,Hilarious!,1220400000,"09 3, 2008",2008,2695,"['watched', 'first', 'episode', 'GHOST', 'STORIES', 'was', 'hoping', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'different.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'watched', 'Japanese', 'drama', 'anime', 'where', 'young', 'school', 'students', 'go', 'demons', 'monsters', 'are', 'haunting', 'school.When', 'started', 'watching', 'GHOST', 'STORIES', 'learned', 'quickly', 'anime', 'dialogue', 'way', 'connected', 'original', 'Japanese', 'series.As', 'characters', 'started', 'talking', 'Rev', 'Al', 'Sharpton', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Satsuki', 'ribbing', 'brother', 'calling', 'retarded', 'lack', 'speaking', 'well', 'when', 'excited', 'was', 'definitely', 'surprised.What', 'essentially', 'happened', 'was', 'ADR', 'director', 'Steve', 'Fosterrewrote', 'dialogue', 'anime', 'did', 'improvisational', 'adaption', 'it.Foster', 'brought', 'best', 'voice', 'talent', 'anime', 'Chris', 'Patton', 'Christine', 'Auten', 'Greg', 'Ayres', 'Hilary', 'Haag', 'Illich', 'Guardiola', 'Monica', 'Rial', 'Rob', 'Mungle', 'took', 'anime', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'uber-crappy', 'made', 'hillarious', 'comedy.The', 'main', 'storyline', 'GHOST', 'STORIES', 'adventures', 'new', 'student', 'Satsuki', 'crybaby', 'brother.The', 'two', 'children', 'pet', 'cat', 'father', 'move', 'city', 'where', 'mother', 'father', 'first', 'met.Through', 'unfortunate', 'circumstances', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'closed', 'haunted', 'school', 'try', 'find', 'cat.Fortunately', 'have', 'help', 'neighbor', 'Hajime', 'nerdy', 'Jewish', 'friend', 'also', 'help', 'girl', 'who', 'hardcore', 'born', 'again', 'Christian.The', 'kids', 'learn', 'Satsuki', 'mother', 'was', 'principal', 'school', 'left', 'book', 'how', 'seal', 'monsters.Thus', 'kids', 'become', 'somewhat', 'Team', 'Ghostbusters', 'missing', 'cat', 'accidentally', 'sealed', 'demon', 'pet', 'cat.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'anime', 'top', 'notch', 'hear', 'improvise', 'come', 'up', 'hilarious', 'dialogue', 'just', 'impressive.A', 'lot', 'improvisation', 'have', 'seen', 'past', 'were', 'usually', 'featured', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'ala', 'outtakes.So', 'understatement', 'last', 'when', 'actual', 'feature', 'improv', 'acting', 'so', 'surreal.Sure', 'animation', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'was', 'told', 'original', 'Japanese', 'dialogue', 'was', 'not', 'exciiting', 'So', 'ADV', 'really', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'awesome', 'absolutely', 'hillarious', 'DVD', 'final', 'release', 'October', '25', 'will', 'feature', '4', 'episodes', '100', 'minutes', 'special', 'features', 'such', 'ghost', 'profiles', 'background', 'Japanese', 'folktales', 'clean', 'opening', 'closing', 'animation', 'more.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'will', 'start', 'trend', 'comedic', 'improv', 'acting', 'voice', 'dubs', 'anime', 'series', 'happen', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'buying', 'highly', 'recommend', 'checking', 'GHOST', 'STORIES', 'out']",N/A

They revealed that they were taking this D-List title that no one had ever heard of before and had skipped on producing a faithful English adaptation. Instead, they produced a biting and very funny parody dub while leaving an accurate subtitled version intact for those fans who just have to watch it in Japanese. Thank goodness for that! In its original form, Ghost Stories is an utterly mediocre series that culls its plot-lines from well-known urban legends, ghost stories, and even horror movies. It focuses on horror elements, but by trying to remain a family-friendly show, never manages to be scary. It's faux-horror, sort of like Scooby-Doo. It's not unwatchable, but its just so average why would you want to?This hilarious parody dub is the real selling point. Pithy, biting, self-aware, and extremely funny, the basic story-line of the original is intact, but features completely different dialogue and played for laughs. Motherless Satsuki and her mentally challenged brother Keichiiro move to a new town with their widower father. On the grounds of their new school is an old haunted school building. When they and their new friends, Leo, Momoko, and Hajime venture inside looking for Satsuki's cat, they accidentally release the vengeful ghosts previously sealed away by Satsuki's dead mother. ...And their cat gets possessed by the sarcastic demon Amanojaku. The rest of the series follows their trials and tribulations  as they try to reseal these troublesome spirits.I thought I wouldn't care to much for Ghost Stories because the first episode its not very funny. It's the episodes that follow that strike comedy gold. Episodes dealing with haunted toilets, piano ghosts, and a very bad school play, give the script writters and actors a lot of funny material to work with. As I have rewatched this disk multiple times and still find it enjoyable, I can honestly say that this comedy has shelf-life. It won't go stale after the first viewing.Handling script writting is direction duty is Steven Foster, the person who also handled the parody dub of the Super Milk-chan Show. If you liked the humor in that series, you will like this. Maybe even more so because the humor in Super Milk was long winded. But good writting is nothing without good delivery. Ghost Stories has that in spades as the acting credits is practically a who's-who list of the very best of ADV's in-house talent.ADV made the right choice in creating this alternative version. They took a series that no one would have cared about other wise and made it a stand-out title as well as outstanding.",4,Hilarious Parody Dub Invigorates D-List Title,1150848000,"06 21, 2006",2006,2697,"['bit', 'Ghost', 'Stories', 'vol', '1', 'first', 'hit', 'store', 'shelf', 'ADV', 'caused', 'angry', 'explosion', 'snotty', 'anime', 'purists', 'revealed', 'were', 'taking', 'D-List', 'title', 'one', 'had', 'ever', 'heard', 'before', 'had', 'skipped', 'producing', 'faithful', 'English', 'adaptation', 'Instead', 'produced', 'biting', 'very', 'funny', 'parody', 'dub', 'leaving', 'accurate', 'subtitled', 'version', 'intact', 'fans', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'Japanese', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'original', 'form', 'Ghost', 'Stories', 'utterly', 'mediocre', 'series', 'plot-lines', 'well-known', 'urban', 'legends', 'ghost', 'stories', 'even', 'horror', 'movies', 'horror', 'elements', 'trying', 'remain', 'family-friendly', 'show', 'never', 'be', 'scary', 'faux-horror', 'sort', 'Scooby-Doo', 'not', 'unwatchable', 'just', 'so', 'average', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'hilarious', 'parody', 'dub', 'real', 'selling', 'point', 'Pithy', 'biting', 'self-aware', 'extremely', 'funny', 'basic', 'story-line', 'original', 'intact', 'completely', 'different', 'dialogue', 'played', 'laughs', 'Motherless', 'Satsuki', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'brother', 'Keichiiro', 'move', 'new', 'town', 'widower', 'father', 'grounds', 'new', 'school', 'old', 'haunted', 'school', 'building', 'When', 'new', 'friends', 'Leo', 'Momoko', 'Hajime', 'venture', 'looking', 'Satsuki', 'cat', 'accidentally', 'release', 'vengeful', 'ghosts', 'previously', 'sealed', 'away', 'Satsuki', 'dead', 'mother', 'cat', 'possessed', 'sarcastic', 'demon', 'Amanojaku', 'rest', 'series', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'try', 'reseal', 'troublesome', 'spirits.I', 'thought', 'would', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'Ghost', 'Stories', 'first', 'episode', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'episodes', 'follow', 'strike', 'comedy', 'gold', 'Episodes', 'dealing', 'haunted', 'toilets', 'piano', 'ghosts', 'very', 'bad', 'school', 'play', 'give', 'script', 'writters', 'actors', 'lot', 'funny', 'material', 'work', 'have', 'rewatched', 'disk', 'multiple', 'times', 'still', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'comedy', 'shelf-life', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'stale', 'first', 'viewing.Handling', 'script', 'writting', 'direction', 'duty', 'Steven', 'Foster', 'person', 'who', 'also', 'handled', 'parody', 'dub', 'Super', 'Milk-chan', 'Show', 'liked', 'humor', 'series', 'will', 'like', 'Maybe', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'humor', 'Super', 'Milk', 'was', 'long', 'winded', 'good', 'writting', 'nothing', 'good', 'delivery', 'Ghost', 'Stories', 'that', 'spades', 'acting', 'credits', 'practically', ""who's-who"", 'list', 'very', 'best', 'ADV', 'in-house', 'talent.ADV', 'made', 'right', 'choice', 'creating', 'alternative', 'version', 'took', 'series', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'cared', 'other', 'wise', 'made', 'stand-out', 'title', 'as', 'well', 'outstanding']",N/A

But not like it's done here.The basic story is still the same: Satsuke (who, with her pigtailed red hair, looks alot like an elementary school version of female Ranma,) must exorcise the old abandoned school house of it's many ghosts with the help of her younger brother and three neighborhood friends, and her mother's diary. However, many other things have changed, including character's personalities. (You probably know what I mean if you've read the other reviews.)If you don't like the type of humor here, you can still always watch the Japanese-with-subtitles version. But I watched the dub and laughed till my sides hurt. Also, if you are hearing impaired or have a friend who is, there is a third language track where it's the dub and the subtitles read what the American voice actors are saying, so everyone can enjoy it. I now own the first two disks in the series and am going to buy the third when it comes out.",5,Intentional alteration of dialogue done as an art form.,1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,1212,"['Intentionally', 'altering', 'dialogue', 'changing', 'not', 'just', 'language', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'actually', 'saying', 'added', 'humor', 'including', 'adding', 'more', 'profanity', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'least', 'much', 'lesser', 'degree', 'shows', 'BURN-UP', 'W', 'THOSE', 'WHO', 'HUNT', 'ELVES', 'even', 'PUNI', 'PUNI', 'POEMY', 'not', 'done', 'here.The', 'basic', 'story', 'still', 'same', 'Satsuke', 'who', 'pigtailed', 'red', 'hair', 'alot', 'elementary', 'school', 'version', 'female', 'Ranma', 'must', 'exorcise', 'old', 'abandoned', 'school', 'house', 'many', 'ghosts', 'help', 'younger', 'brother', 'three', 'neighborhood', 'friends', 'mother', 'diary', 'However', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'including', 'character', 'personalities', 'probably', 'know', 'what', 'mean', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'type', 'humor', 'here', 'can', 'still', 'always', 'watch', 'Japanese-with-subtitles', 'version', 'watched', 'dub', 'laughed', 'till', 'sides', 'hurt', 'Also', 'are', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'have', 'friend', 'who', 'third', 'language', 'track', 'where', 'dub', 'subtitles', 'read', 'what', 'American', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'saying', 'everyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'now', 'own', 'first', 'two', 'disks', 'series', 'am', 'going', 'buy', 'third', 'when', 'out']",N/A
