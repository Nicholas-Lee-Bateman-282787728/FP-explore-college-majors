Given the dialogue & voiceovers in the film are theatrical,this is a majestic battle between good & evil on the best stage ever. The main good guy & bad guy both know a lot. There is an understanding that humans can easily kill each other,however they rarely have to. Inevitably in this case the characters sink to the ""have to.""

229267,A3SJU7T0G9OXDN,6300250237,Mike Crestwood,"[8, 12]","The premise is a good one---the crew of an isolated lightship is invaded by a trio of ne'er-do-wells with evil intent---but the plot, like a real lightship, doesn't go anywhere.  The father-son relationship between the ship's captain (Klaus Marie Brandeur) and his erstwhile son seems forced, the story of the father's previous cowardice seems to be just the opposite---great leadership, and the relationship between the captain and his chief antagonist (Robert Duvall in a horrible role) never generates even a single spark of tension. Beyond the poor acting and directing is the fact that no tension is ever built anywhere, and the crew never use their knowledge of the sea and the lightship to get back at the bad guys.  Additionally, they never disarm the bad guys, despite numerous opportunities to do so and a radio warning to be on the lookout for the terrible trio.  What were they thinking when the three idiots show up?  These aren't the bad guys?  DUMB! One of the biggest distractions was the director's lack of attention to detail: all the interior shots were obviously filmed in a studio backlot, not onboard a real lightship.  The sets never moves while the actors say their dialogue, and all the while the lightship is supposed to be foundering in a violent storm.  Ridiculous! If you are hoping for a tense, claustrophobic, nightmarish potboiler (like I was) then you are in for a great disappointment.

Actually he sort of reminded me of Ledger as Joker in the Batman film. Which came first?I found it quite satisfactory for one watching but would be unlikely to watch it again. Okay for an evening as a suspense/adventure film. More interesting than most. But like most, once the characters have played themselves out and there are no more mysteries, the film is done. No truly memorable moments. The depth of the characters is not all that deep to go back and ponder another time.
