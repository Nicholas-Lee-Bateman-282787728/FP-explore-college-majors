The acting is dubious, in terms of its sincerity and BooBoo Stewart seems very awkward in the role of a religious teen trying to help.  What really is disappointing is the gag reel.  It really is not appropriate for a movie trying to impart a serious message to have a gag reel where the actors are shown laughing during what should be a serious moment.  I am fairly mixed about this movie and am not sure I would recommend it.",3,A good message that gets muddled,1397692800,"04 17, 2014",2014,552,"['Teen', 'suicide', 'attempts', 'are', 'always', 'tragedy', 'movie', 'was', 'attempting', 'get', 'message', 'levels', 'acting', 'dubious', 'terms', 'sincerity', 'BooBoo', 'Stewart', 'very', 'awkward', 'role', 'religious', 'teen', 'trying', 'help', 'What', 'really', 'disappointing', 'gag', 'reel', 'really', 'not', 'appropriate', 'movie', 'trying', 'impart', 'serious', 'message', 'have', 'gag', 'reel', 'where', 'actors', 'are', 'shown', 'laughing', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'serious', 'moment', 'am', 'fairly', 'mixed', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'recommend']",Logan

The movie confronts school bullies and teen angst. There are happy and sad parts. I did not care for how it ended. I think it needed about another thirty minutes to complete the story line. The acting from the kids was realistic and genuine. Booboo plays a Christian kid trying to share his point of view with his friend. Never seen him playing a part like that, I think it was a hard role for him. They all did good and the parents do come around. I recommend this film for anyone with 10 year old kids on up.

Clay ""drakkar91""","[0, 0]","It's difficult to rate a film with a great message poorly, but unfortunately, there are few redeeming qualities in this production.  While I agree the message is important, there are better films and documentaries on the topic of teen isolation / bullying / depression / suicide.  This is not one of them.  The acting is fair at best and sometimes absolutely poor, and the sheer lack of compassionate adults is questionable.  While it appears this is a low-budget (independent) production, I have seen many that are of far superior quality.  It reminded me of an after school special, only those are typically much better.  ConsiderDead Poets SocietyorPrayers for Bobby.  The recentThe Perks of Being a Wallflower, while certainly large scale in production is powerful and I highly recommend.",2,"Great Message, But Poorly Executed",1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,792,"['difficult', 'rate', 'film', 'great', 'message', 'poorly', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'few', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'production', 'agree', 'message', 'important', 'are', 'better', 'films', 'documentaries', 'topic', 'teen', 'isolation', '/', 'bullying', '/', 'depression', '/', 'suicide', 'not', 'one', 'acting', 'fair', 'best', 'sometimes', 'absolutely', 'poor', 'sheer', 'lack', 'compassionate', 'adults', 'questionable', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'production', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'are', 'far', 'superior', 'quality', 'reminded', 'school', 'special', 'only', 'are', 'typically', 'much', 'better', 'ConsiderDead', 'Poets', 'SocietyorPrayers', 'Bobby', 'recentThe', 'Perks', 'Being', 'Wallflower', 'certainly', 'large', 'scale', 'production', 'powerful', 'highly', 'recommend']",Logan

The topic of youth suicide is dealt with in a sensitive manner and does remind all of us that one of the chief reasons that suicide is attempted or completed is the individual thinks that they are totally alone and have no support.The acting left a lot to be desired.  I'm think that the youth actors were just beginning in their careers.  Some have gone on to other roles.
