1432255,A1SO8AE23KZ0HZ,B004XH9X40,"Echo ""Echo""","[2, 2]","...but here it is, in a pretty nice presentation, too!The movie is apocalyptic, dystopian, and low-budget - the best kind.  It's twenty years after a plague killed most people, and for some reason cars are banned.  Lee Majors is Franklin Hart, a former race car driver employed by an authoritarian government to promote mass transit and warn of the evils of private vehicle ownership.  He of course has hidden his race car underneath the foundation of his garage, and has been sneaking around junkyards for parts to make his car run again.  (You would think that a world that has banned cars would have recycled them already, but whatever.)Of course his activities are detected, and he makes his escape with the obligatory but forgettable cute kid in tow. The government can't go after him because they have no automobiles (they have golf carts though..huh?) so they send an old pilot (Burgess Meredith) in a restored Korean War-era jet fighter.The cat-and-mouse chase ensues, and I'll leave the reader to check out the DVD to find out what happens.This was a low-budget, creative Canadian film that for some reason was a staple on late 1980s HBO, Showtime, The Movie Channel, etc.  Except for a trivial VHS release, this has never made it to DVD until now.The DVD picture and sound are not Blu-Ray, but they are more than adequate.  Director Martyn Burke contributes an interesting commentary track, an on-camera featurette, as does co-star George Touliatos.  Bizarrely, this otherwise tame movie has some nude scenes that were previously (and wisely) left on the cutting-room floor.Pick this one up, it's a keeper.  And it's not like we're likely to get this again anytime soon.",5,I had about given up on this movie ever being released on DVD...,1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,1680,"['here', 'pretty', 'nice', 'presentation', 'too', 'movie', 'apocalyptic', 'dystopian', 'low-budget', 'best', 'kind', 'twenty', 'years', 'plague', 'killed', 'most', 'people', 'reason', 'cars', 'are', 'banned', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'Franklin', 'Hart', 'former', 'race', 'car', 'driver', 'employed', 'authoritarian', 'government', 'promote', 'mass', 'transit', 'warn', 'evils', 'private', 'vehicle', 'ownership', 'course', 'hidden', 'race', 'car', 'foundation', 'garage', 'been', 'sneaking', 'around', 'junkyards', 'parts', 'make', 'car', 'run', 'again', 'would', 'think', 'world', 'banned', 'cars', 'would', 'have', 'recycled', 'already', 'whatever', 'course', 'activities', 'are', 'detected', 'escape', 'obligatory', 'forgettable', 'cute', 'kid', 'tow', 'government', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'have', 'automobiles', 'have', 'golf', 'carts', 'though..huh', 'send', 'old', 'pilot', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'restored', 'Korean', 'War-era', 'jet', 'fighter.The', 'cat-and-mouse', 'chase', 'ensues', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'reader', 'check', 'out', 'DVD', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happens.This', 'was', 'low-budget', 'creative', 'Canadian', 'film', 'reason', 'was', 'staple', 'late', '1980s', 'HBO', 'Showtime', 'Movie', 'Channel', 'etc', 'trivial', 'VHS', 'release', 'never', 'made', 'DVD', 'now.The', 'DVD', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'not', 'Blu-Ray', 'are', 'more', 'adequate', 'Director', 'Martyn', 'Burke', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'track', 'on-camera', 'featurette', 'co-star', 'George', 'Touliatos', 'Bizarrely', 'otherwise', 'tame', 'movie', 'nude', 'scenes', 'were', 'previously', 'wisely', 'left', 'cutting-room', 'floor.Pick', 'one', 'up', 'keeper', 'not', ""'re"", 'likely', 'get', 'again', 'anytime', 'soon']",N/A

1432259,A1E1FGV9V1WQ6A,B004XH9X40,Justin Playfair,"[2, 3]","This is a fun, fast-paced, and intelligently-written story that I still enjoy watching after 30 years. I'll start with the negatives since there are fewer of them.CONS:- The movie was apparently done on a limited budget and sometimes this shows.- The acting overall is only so-so, with the exception of Burgess Meredith (RIP) who was excellent and arguably had the best role in the filmPROS:- A fast-paced, suspenseful and exciting story with credible, interesting, and likable characters- ""Dark and foreboding"" may be a bit of a cliche but it's also the best way to describe the atmosphere in this movie.- This movie's biggest strength in my opinion is the story. Yes, there are aspects of it that stretch credibility (the game of ""chicken"" towards the end comes to mind) but overall it's very well-written.What really stands out and still impresses me 30 years later is how prescient the story is. Gas shortages and military laser weapon systems might not have taken a genius to think up, but in 1981 few people would have imagined some of the other things that feature prominently in the plot of ""The Last Chase"".- A hacker harassing a government agency: Computers were rare and exotic in 1981 and few people had heard of hacking (WarGames appeared 2 years after this film).- A weaker Russia that's no longer a military threat: When this movie was made the Soviet Union was still considered very strong and was expected by most people to be a threat to the United States well into the foreseeable future.- A population ravaged by a plague of unknown origin: Back in 1981 people were mainly afraid of nuclear war; biological warfare wasn't really on the radar and Swine Flu and Avian Flu were completely unknown.In short, this film did an amazing job of speculating about what issues might influence life in the near future: gas shortages, laser weapons, computer hacking, a post-superpower Russia, and biological threats.The main reason to watch ""The Last Chase"", though, is that it's great film that's a lot of fun to watch and for that reason I can't recommend this underrated gem highly enough.",5,An underrated movie that was ahead of its time,1308787200,"06 23, 2011",2011,2100,"['fun', 'fast-paced', 'intelligently-written', 'story', 'still', 'enjoy', 'watching', '30', 'years', ""'ll"", 'start', 'negatives', 'are', 'fewer', 'them.CONS', 'movie', 'was', 'apparently', 'done', 'limited', 'budget', 'sometimes', 'shows.-', 'acting', 'overall', 'only', 'so-so', 'exception', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'RIP', 'who', 'was', 'excellent', 'arguably', 'had', 'best', 'role', 'filmPROS', 'fast-paced', 'suspenseful', 'exciting', 'story', 'credible', 'interesting', 'likable', 'characters-', 'Dark', 'foreboding', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'cliche', 'also', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'atmosphere', 'movie.-', 'movie', 'biggest', 'strength', 'opinion', 'story', 'Yes', 'are', 'aspects', 'credibility', 'game', 'chicken', 'end', 'mind', 'overall', 'very', 'well-written.What', 'really', 'out', 'still', 'impresses', '30', 'years', 'later', 'how', 'prescient', 'story', 'Gas', 'shortages', 'military', 'laser', 'weapon', 'systems', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'taken', 'genius', 'think', 'up', '1981', 'few', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'imagined', 'other', 'things', 'feature', 'prominently', 'plot', 'Last', 'Chase', '.-', 'hacker', 'harassing', 'government', 'agency', 'Computers', 'were', 'rare', 'exotic', '1981', 'few', 'people', 'had', 'heard', 'hacking', 'WarGames', 'appeared', '2', 'years', 'film', '.-', 'weaker', 'Russia', 'longer', 'military', 'threat', 'When', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'was', 'still', 'considered', 'very', 'strong', 'was', 'expected', 'most', 'people', 'be', 'threat', 'United', 'States', 'well', 'foreseeable', 'future.-', 'population', 'ravaged', 'plague', 'unknown', 'origin', 'Back', '1981', 'people', 'were', 'mainly', 'afraid', 'nuclear', 'war', 'biological', 'warfare', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'radar', 'Swine', 'Flu', 'Avian', 'Flu', 'were', 'completely', 'unknown.In', 'short', 'film', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'speculating', 'what', 'issues', 'might', 'influence', 'life', 'near', 'future', 'gas', 'shortages', 'laser', 'weapons', 'computer', 'hacking', 'post-superpower', 'Russia', 'biological', 'threats.The', 'main', 'reason', 'watch', 'Last', 'Chase', 'great', 'film', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'underrated', 'gem', 'highly', 'enough']",N/A
