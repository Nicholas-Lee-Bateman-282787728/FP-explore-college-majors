1208179,A18VQ5Q4OP0PZY,B001KKU9F0,Dawn M. Allison,"[1, 2]","What can I say, I am hoooooked on this show.  The kids are adorable, Jon and Kate are both long suffering, and I can relate to the Korean background of Jon, as we are currently in the process of adopting from Korea.  I think they are both loving parents, but I have to agree with other folks' assessment of Kate's nasty, whiny, woe-is-me attitude.  Especially troubling due to the rumors of affairs and possible divorce, and my heart breaks for these kids.  Seems fame and fortune ruined these folks, as is common in Hollywood stars.  Too much pressure from stardom, too much temptation, and too much fighting between the couple.  The kids will suffer cuz of this behavior from famous mom and dad.  That being said, this show has become an almost guilty pleasure of mine.  I just love the kids, and initially was impressed by the apparent strenght of the parents commitment to each other and their kids.  I dont think it was a sham-I think they just fell apart and became selfish due to fame.  It still amazes me that they managed to care for eight kids, a daunting task for sure, and it was refreshing to see them as real people.  It breaks my heart that due to Kate's endless insults of jon, adultery, and other things, an ideal family will now be destroyed.  No more Jon and Kate for us, but it is probably better for the poor kids who are now a marketed commodity.  this show started as a few episodes and many of were hooked by the time we realized how exploitive this was getting.  Many folks turned to these shows cuz they wanted a change from sleaze and filth, and ironically, sleaze and filth now follow the Gosselings.",4,Great show!,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,1628,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'am', 'hoooooked', 'show', 'kids', 'are', 'adorable', 'Jon', 'Kate', 'are', 'long', 'suffering', 'can', 'relate', 'Korean', 'background', 'Jon', 'are', 'currently', 'process', 'adopting', 'Korea', 'think', 'are', 'loving', 'parents', 'have', 'agree', 'other', 'folks', 'assessment', 'Kate', 'nasty', 'whiny', 'woe-is-me', 'attitude', 'Especially', 'troubling', 'due', 'rumors', 'affairs', 'possible', 'divorce', 'heart', 'breaks', 'kids', 'Seems', 'fame', 'fortune', 'ruined', 'folks', 'common', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'Too', 'much', 'pressure', 'stardom', 'too', 'much', 'temptation', 'too', 'much', 'fighting', 'couple', 'kids', 'will', 'suffer', 'cuz', 'behavior', 'famous', 'mom', 'dad', 'being', 'said', 'show', 'become', 'almost', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'mine', 'just', 'love', 'kids', 'initially', 'was', 'impressed', 'apparent', 'strenght', 'parents', 'commitment', 'other', 'kids', 'dont', 'think', 'was', 'sham-I', 'think', 'just', 'fell', 'apart', 'became', 'selfish', 'due', 'fame', 'still', 'managed', 'care', 'eight', 'kids', 'daunting', 'task', 'sure', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'real', 'people', 'heart', 'due', 'Kate', 'endless', 'insults', 'jon', 'adultery', 'other', 'things', 'ideal', 'family', 'will', 'now', 'be', 'destroyed', 'more', 'Jon', 'Kate', 'probably', 'better', 'poor', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'marketed', 'commodity', 'show', 'started', 'few', 'episodes', 'many', 'were', 'hooked', 'time', 'realized', 'how', 'exploitive', 'was', 'getting', 'Many', 'folks', 'turned', 'shows', 'cuz', 'wanted', 'change', 'sleaze', 'filth', 'ironically', 'sleaze', 'filth', 'now', 'follow', 'Gosselings']",N/A

""NC""","[5, 7]","There's nothing wrong with the quality of these DVDs, they feature the same episodes we know and love, however, there are some things that could have been improved. Firstly, there is no ""play all"" option, which would have been a nice feature. Also, when watching on a computer you can't skip and reverse by clicking on the progress bar, you actually have to fast forward and rewind using the extremely slow arrows. This makes finding specific scenes or moments in the episode more difficult than it needs to be. I've tried doing this in several programs and on more than one computer, but I apologize if this is something that works for others.Especially troubling is the fact that regularly aired episodes are listed as 'Special Features'. These are listed on the box as ""Behind the Scenes"" and ""Viewer Faq"", which makes one think these are things we haven't seen before. If it's an episode that is played regularly, it's not a Special Feature. The music video featured on the DVD was also shown on TV. This wouldn't have deterred me from purchasing these DVDs, but I find the misadvertising annoying.If you love this show, these DVDs are still great!",3,A Little Misleading.,1237334400,"03 18, 2009",2009,1152,"['nothing', 'wrong', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'feature', 'same', 'know', 'love', 'however', 'are', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'Firstly', 'play', 'option', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'feature', 'Also', 'when', 'watching', 'computer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'skip', 'reverse', 'clicking', 'progress', 'bar', 'actually', 'have', 'fast', 'forward', 'rewind', 'using', 'extremely', 'slow', 'arrows', 'finding', 'specific', 'scenes', 'moments', 'episode', 'more', 'difficult', 'be', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'doing', 'several', 'programs', 'more', 'one', 'computer', 'apologize', 'something', 'others.Especially', 'troubling', 'fact', 'regularly', 'aired', 'episodes', 'are', 'listed', ""'Special"", 'Features', 'are', 'listed', 'box', 'Scenes', 'Viewer', 'Faq', 'one', 'think', 'are', 'things', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'episode', 'played', 'regularly', 'not', 'Special', 'Feature', 'music', 'video', 'featured', 'DVD', 'was', 'also', 'shown', 'TV', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'deterred', 'purchasing', 'DVDs', 'find', 'misadvertising', 'annoying.If', 'love', 'show', 'DVDs', 'are', 'still', 'great']",N/A

The third season is still the lovable Gosselin family, the episodes are the finest of the series so far as it showed us the families real daily lives around the home more than recent episodes but the children were older and more mature than earlier seasons. This set also has the especially enjoyable episodes that focused on individual time between Jon & Kate with each individual child on their own special day. Episodes included in this 4 disc set are:Trip To The ZooDay In The LifeTwins Turn 7!Kate Hires A NannyWinter PreparationPotty Training the BoysFamily Photo ShootKate's Wardrobe MakeoverGosselin Family ChristmasPlane Ride to UtahGosselins Go SkiingTwins Get MusicalCooking with the TwinsCarpeting the HouseValentine's DayColor me GosselinLeah and JoelAaden and HannahAlexis and ColinMady's DayCara's DayJon & Kate's Special DayOprah Here We ComeHousehold ChoresGosselins Take the StageGames Gosselins PlayMemorial Day PicnicDisciplineJon's Hair Raising ExperienceJon & Kate Family Movie NightPlus Special Features: Behind the Scenes of Jon & Kate Plus 8 (which originally aired as an episode).Viewer FAQ (Which originally aired as an episode)Music Video: A Hug & A Kiss (Which was promoted and aired once on television)All episodes this season are shot and shown in 16:9 Anamorphic Widescreen Aspect Ratio. Audio is Dolby Digital 2.0. There Are English Subtitles,  the set is rated G and has a running time of approx. 698 minutes.This season is in my opinion the best Jon & Kate has to offer. I haven't enjoyed recent episodes as much as these ones, possibly because they've been away from home alot doing too many out of the ordinary things that I can't relate to when I always found that sense of home to be the heart of the series. Hopefully now that they've settled into their new house the show will return more to the format I enjoyed. Though the hype the show has received and the affect it seems to have had (in my opinion) on the family will never allow it to be as great as it was in this third season it is still and probably will always be an enjoyable family series for most and they're who I recommend this to.",4,Hopefully Helpful Information,1234224000,"02 10, 2009",2009,2352,"[""'m"", 'assuming', 'people', 'looking', 'already', 'know', 'not', 'like', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'not', 'hard', 'catch', 'episodes', 'playing', 'almost', 'clock', 'syndication', 'TLC', 'third', 'season', 'still', 'lovable', 'Gosselin', 'family', 'episodes', 'are', 'finest', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'showed', 'families', 'real', 'daily', 'home', 'more', 'recent', 'episodes', 'children', 'were', 'older', 'more', 'mature', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'set', 'also', 'especially', 'enjoyable', 'episodes', 'focused', 'individual', 'time', 'Jon', 'Kate', 'individual', 'child', 'own', 'special', 'day', 'Episodes', 'included', '4', 'disc', 'set', 'are', 'Trip', 'ZooDay', 'LifeTwins', 'Turn', '7', 'Kate', 'A', 'NannyWinter', 'PreparationPotty', 'Training', 'BoysFamily', 'Photo', 'ShootKate', 'Wardrobe', 'MakeoverGosselin', 'Family', 'ChristmasPlane', 'Ride', 'UtahGosselins', 'Go', 'SkiingTwins', 'Get', 'MusicalCooking', 'TwinsCarpeting', 'HouseValentine', 'DayColor', 'GosselinLeah', 'JoelAaden', 'HannahAlexis', 'ColinMady', 'DayCara', 'DayJon', 'Kate', 'Special', 'DayOprah', 'Here', 'ComeHousehold', 'ChoresGosselins', 'Take', 'StageGames', 'Gosselins', 'PlayMemorial', 'Day', 'PicnicDisciplineJon', 'Hair', 'Raising', 'ExperienceJon', 'Kate', 'Family', 'Movie', 'NightPlus', 'Special', 'Features', 'Scenes', 'Jon', 'Kate', '8', 'originally', 'aired', 'episode', '.Viewer', 'FAQ', 'Which', 'originally', 'aired', 'episode', 'Music', 'Video', 'A', 'Hug', 'A', 'Kiss', 'Which', 'was', 'promoted', 'aired', 'once', 'television', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'shot', 'shown', '16:9', 'Anamorphic', 'Widescreen', 'Aspect', 'Ratio', 'Audio', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', 'Are', 'English', 'Subtitles', 'set', 'rated', 'G', 'running', 'time', 'approx', '698', 'minutes.This', 'season', 'opinion', 'best', 'Jon', 'Kate', 'offer', 'have', ""n't"", 'enjoyed', 'recent', 'episodes', 'as', 'much', 'ones', 'possibly', ""'ve"", 'been', 'away', 'home', 'alot', 'doing', 'too', 'many', 'ordinary', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'when', 'always', 'found', 'sense', 'home', 'be', 'heart', 'series', 'Hopefully', 'now', ""'ve"", 'settled', 'new', 'house', 'show', 'will', 'return', 'more', 'format', 'enjoyed', 'hype', 'show', 'received', 'affect', 'have', 'had', 'opinion', 'family', 'will', 'never', 'allow', 'be', 'as', 'great', 'was', 'third', 'season', 'still', 'probably', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'family', 'series', 'most', ""'re"", 'who', 'recommend']",N/A
