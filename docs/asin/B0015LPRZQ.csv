Don't let the neo-Nazi/Hitler/racist premise scare you off from enjoying a well-written and entertaining character study -- a really solid little piece of cinema. Great performances all around: Jeremy Renner's star is guaranteed to continue rising, as evident in his work as the troubled but likable Ned -- and even Gabrielle Union (who I usually find rather flat, predictable and ultimately uninteresting despite her prettiness) succeeds here as well. Union, thanks to the tight script and adept directing, perhaps puts in the best work of her career. And I agree with another reviewer's observation: there's great chemistry between the two leads, empowering the notion of their characters' profoundly unlikely romance. Overall, the film is at times dark, humorous, genuinely touching and never heavy-handed or unforgivably false. I consider Neo Ned a more insightful, true and telling treatise on racism in America than 2009's laughable and embarrassing The Blind Side.

1149906,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B0015LPRZQ,Eric Sanberg,"[11, 11]","This is not unlike ""American X"" in that it deals with a Neo-Nazi who is in an institution for a crime committed against a black man. In this case it's a mental institution as opposed to a prison but the set up is similar.Here's the scoop. Jeremy Renner has had a rough upbringing, with a father who was in and out of prison and a mom who isn't all there. One group that will except him, and give him a sense of family, are skin heads. Not a good idea. Now he's in a mental ward though he really isn't crazy and he becomes fascinated by a fellow inmate, a black woman, who thinks she's Hitler. She's had her share of hard blows and the two somehow work well together.Renner is great as Ned. He's kind of goofy. Due to his lousy upbringing he's somewhat naive and doesn't express himself well. But he actually has a lot of spirit. It's just misdirected. Gabrielle Union is also very good. They do a good job of bringing out her natural beauty as opposed to dolling her all up. They are the heart of the picture. This is all writing and acting. No frou frou. It seems most of the money was spent on the cast. It was a real surprise to see Steve Railsback, Sally Kirkland and Cary Elwes in the lineup. The cinematography was very plain. The shots were framed well but the lensing gave it a look only a few steps up from a home movie. I like this as it gave a very natural flavor to everything. Even in it's lackluster appearance you still feel the authority in the directing. This is only Van Fisher's second outing but you'd never know. It's as smooth as silk.Some might question the ending but I thought it fitting. Both characters go after what is important to them. Renner does it in a weird way but he's happy in the end which is something he's seen little of in his time. I like this movie. It's a good drama that doesn't get too heavy.

1149921,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B0015LPRZQ,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[14, 40]","First off, I am a black woman. Now, saying that I must say that this movie was ridiculous. I love Gabrielle Union and I also like the guy that played Ned but the plot kills the film because it's too unrealistic for words.What were the writers thinking? There is no way in the world that a skinhead would ever date a black woman! Skinheads are so consumed with hate and disgust for blacks and other races that I could not believe the writers wrote this film like this. There is no way in the world a skinhead would date a black woman! No way! Also, there is no way in the world that a self-respecting black woman (even if she was supposed to be crazy) would date a skin head!  This is utter nonsense! There is just no way. So since that's the main plot, the film can't be saved from that point of few. Ned would have had to be an ex-skinhead or someone who was far removed from that lifestyle to even look at a black woman even if they were as gorgeous and sexy as Gabrielle Union. There is no, no, no, no way and I can't believe the writers wrote this like this! And Ned was more of a wannabe skinhead anyway. Every time he called Rachel the N word, I held my breath because it didn't fit his character at all. And what black woman would date a white man who called her this word to her face???? Please!!!!Maybe if the writers had focused on Ned's weakness of being a skinhead or the reason why he was one so we could get a glimpse of him, maybe believing a romance with him and Rachel would work. But the writers didn't delve into anything and these characters were extremely one dimensional. All we know is Ned's a skin head. All we know is Rachel is crazy, was molested and may or may not think she's Hitler!!! What else? We know nothing more about these people! How can you base a film on lead characters that no one knows nothing about! We know nothing about Rachel's upbringing and too much about Ned's. We really don't know why they were together romantically. I got the feeling that Ned wanted to just have sex with Rachel and maybe Rachel was using him to get out the crazy house. But, the writers don't go into anything so we're left clueless!Aside from that the film has no real plot. Is the plot their romance or them escaping from the mental hospital? I would have rather them stayed in the mental hospital because it was more interesting than watching Ned and Rachel by themselves, especially dealing with such an unrealistic romance that wouldn't happen in a million years.The acting was very good. I have no complaints there. I am a big fan of Union's and she gets better in each movie. I don't know why she took this obviously low-budget film to be honest. Maybe she and Cary Elwes liked the script. That's the only reason I can see two actors of their calibar and reputation being in this movie. It's obvious it was an independent film going nowhere. The movie is okay just to watch but you cannot take it seriously or really get into it because it's too unrealistic. A skinhead would have probably raped and killed Rachel, not date her.So, if you want light-hearted entertainment you should check this out. I saw it on Starz for free. I wouldn't pay any money for it. The film is too cheap-looking and besides Union and Elwes it's full of a bunch of no names whose characters fall flat.

1149924,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0015LPRZQ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Neo Ned (Van Fischer, 2005)A fun if forgettable little film that is saved from Lifetime Original Moviedom solely by well-above-average performances by the two leads, The Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner and 10 Things I Hate About You's Gabrielle Union. Renner plays the title character, a goofy, happy-go-lucky neo-Nazi (yeah, I was wondering about that too) at the opening of the film who is forced to question his beliefs when he finds himself falling for African-American hearttthrob Union. Despite her better judgment, she returns his affection, and the two of them set out to see if they can make a life for themselves despite their obvious fractured beginnings. It is very rare to see white power played for laughs, and any director who's going to attempt it has to be prepared to walk a very fine line; I get the feeling that's one of the reasons why this movie never went much of anywhere, but it seemed to me Van Fischer (Blink of an Eye) did a pretty good job with that aspect of the film, using the comedy aspects of it to keep the movie light while it strayed into some very dark places. It lacks subtlety in a lot of areas, and it pays lip service to American History X a time or two without ever approaching the depth or gravity of that one. Still, as a lightweight  and surprisingly funny film about the redemption of a white-power skinhead, well, it would be pretty hard to do better, if only because it has been so rarely done before. ***",3,"No matter how I hold my head up, it just feels wrong.",1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,1450,"['Neo', 'Ned', 'Van', 'Fischer', '2005', 'fun', 'forgettable', 'little', 'film', 'saved', 'Lifetime', 'Original', 'Moviedom', 'solely', 'well-above-average', 'performances', 'two', 'leads', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'Renner', 'title', 'character', 'goofy', 'happy-go-lucky', 'neo-Nazi', 'yeah', 'was', 'wondering', 'too', 'opening', 'film', 'who', 'forced', 'question', 'beliefs', 'when', 'falling', 'African-American', 'hearttthrob', 'Union', 'better', 'judgment', 'affection', 'two', 'set', 'out', 'see', 'can', 'make', 'life', 'obvious', 'fractured', 'beginnings', 'very', 'rare', 'see', 'white', 'power', 'played', 'laughs', 'director', 'who', 'going', 'attempt', 'be', 'prepared', 'walk', 'very', 'fine', 'line', 'get', 'feeling', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'movie', 'never', 'went', 'much', 'anywhere', 'seemed', 'Van', 'Fischer', 'Blink', 'Eye', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'aspect', 'film', 'using', 'comedy', 'aspects', 'keep', 'movie', 'light', 'strayed', 'very', 'dark', 'places', 'subtlety', 'lot', 'areas', 'lip', 'service', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'time', 'two', 'ever', 'approaching', 'depth', 'gravity', 'one', 'Still', 'lightweight', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'film', 'redemption', 'white-power', 'skinhead', 'well', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'hard', 'do', 'better', 'only', 'been', 'so', 'rarely', 'done', 'before', '***']",Neo Ned
