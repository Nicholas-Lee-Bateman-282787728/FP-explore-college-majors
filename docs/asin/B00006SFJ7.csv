He was vaudeville and everyone including the ladies were a hoot!  Listen carefully to his on time remarks carefully and you will get the jokes.Just received this dvd and they did a really good job of cleaning up the video and audio. I have seen other copies that you could barely watch due to the lousy reproduction but i was really impressed with this one.",5,Fifty pounds and chop it fine.,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,473,"['Three', 'favorite', 'w.c', 'field', 'classics', 'time', 'was', 'really', 'risque', 'stuff-especially', 'dentist', 'sketch', 'was', 'vaudeville', 'everyone', 'including', 'ladies', 'were', 'hoot', 'Listen', 'carefully', 'time', 'remarks', 'carefully', 'will', 'get', 'jokes.Just', 'received', 'dvd', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'cleaning', 'up', 'video', 'audio', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'copies', 'could', 'barely', 'watch', 'due', 'lousy', 'reproduction', 'i', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'one']",W.C.

Viewing this soporific collection of three 20 odd minute shorts was a total waste of time.  I actually did not laugh once during any of the shorts.  I suppose that Fields was honing his craft at this time (1932) because most of his later work was a laugh riot.Definitely pass this one up.",1,Awful collection of shorts,1044403200,"02 5, 2003",2003,390,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'pretty', 'big', 'fan', 'W.C', 'Fields', 'what', 'prompted', 'purchase', 'item', 'Viewing', 'soporific', 'collection', 'three', '20', 'odd', 'minute', 'shorts', 'was', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'actually', 'did', 'not', 'laugh', 'once', 'shorts', 'suppose', 'Fields', 'was', 'honing', 'craft', 'time', '1932', 'most', 'later', 'work', 'was', 'laugh', 'riot.Definitely', 'pass', 'one', 'up']",W.C.

Quite reasonable copy. The shorts, as ever, hilarious, like in the sequence of the dentist father asking his teenage daughter: Where is my newspaper? Answer: You're sitting on it.
