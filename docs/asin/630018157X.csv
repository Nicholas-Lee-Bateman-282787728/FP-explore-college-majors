200099,A2S244KFX0745K,630018157X,Alan Edward Creager,"[2, 2]","""MacArthur"" is a thundering triumph of a film, much as MacArthur was as a man. Released in 2001 by Universal Studios, ""MacArthur"" is 2 hours and 10 minutes in length, and stars Gregory Peck as the heroic, egotistical, and brilliant General of the Army and Medal of Honor recipient Douglas MacArthur. Peck's performance of his role as the great General is not just an ordinary role in an ordinary movie- it is the performance of a career, of a lifetime. It is some of the best acting I have ever seen. And its not just Peck, though he could have easily carried the entire film by himself. MacArthur, with his love of dramatics and delight in being the center of everything, knew no other way. Director Joseph Sargent did a superb job, especially with the aid of the magnificent Jerry Goldsmith as the designer of the movie's soundtrack. Compared with the books on MacArthur such as ""American Caesar"", ""MacArthur"" is very short and devoid of many details. But to make a movie that truly told the story of Douglas MacArthur from beginning to end, you'd have to make a series of four-hour films, not just one that runs half of that. Sargent compressed the story of MacArthur's career from before Bataan to after Korea very well.MacArthur was outrageously egotistical and dramatic, always wanting to put on a show when he could have done what most people would have called the more sensible or practical thing to do. On one occasion in the film, a GI warns him to stay down while he is visiting a frontline area, noting that his unit had killed several Japanese snipers nearby not long ago. Not disturbed in the slightest, MacArthur nods approvingly and says, ""That's the best thing to do with them!"" During the siege of Bataan, he was seen more than once calmly watching the Japanese planes attacking- standing outside the bunkers. This film deserves the same recognition 'Patton' enjoys, and I confidently rank George C. Scott's performance in that film and Gregory Peck's in this one on the same level. MacArthur was a man who could turn the making of a cup of coffee into an epic saga worth writing a play about, and this movie captures that part of him superbly. It depicts his brilliance, his total disregard for the danger the enemy posed, his colossal ego and his incredible skill as a strategist and as a leader. All those remarkable traits build him into a five star general and Medal of Honor recipient as the film goes on, until his becomes this unstoppable force that bowls over the Joint Chiefs, the Red Chinese and North Koreans, anyone who gets in his way. Until he meets with Harry Truman, played by yet another superb actor, Ed Flanders, who when learning of the General's flaunting his authority and destroying his attempts to establish a cease fire with the Chinese with a ludicrously arrogant ultimatum, declares, ""I'm gonna fire his insubordinate *** right now!"" MacArthur, a man who had gotten used to having his way, had finally run into someone who was as stubborn as he was. Relieved of command, he returns to the United States, received by an enraptured and joyous American public. At the conclusion of the film, Peck makes a stunning rendition of MacArthur's ""Duty, Honor, Country"" speech that is every bit as good as the version done by the General himself.To anyone who is interested in learning about one of West Point's most distinguished graduates, a man whose incredible brilliance, unparalleled strategic skill, unquestionable courage and colossal ego made and ended his career, I highly recommend ""MacArthur"". It is truly lamentable that this film is not anywhere near as famous as it should be.",5,"Every bit as great a movie as 'Patton', but lamentably unknown.",1269993600,"03 31, 2010",2010,3626,"['MacArthur', 'thundering', 'triumph', 'film', 'much', 'MacArthur', 'was', 'man', 'Released', '2001', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'MacArthur', '2', 'hours', '10', 'minutes', 'length', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'heroic', 'egotistical', 'brilliant', 'General', 'Army', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'recipient', 'Douglas', 'MacArthur', 'Peck', 'performance', 'role', 'great', 'General', 'not', 'just', 'ordinary', 'role', 'ordinary', 'movie-', 'performance', 'career', 'lifetime', 'best', 'acting', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'just', 'Peck', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'carried', 'entire', 'film', 'MacArthur', 'love', 'dramatics', 'delight', 'being', 'center', 'everything', 'knew', 'other', 'way', 'Director', 'Joseph', 'Sargent', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'especially', 'aid', 'magnificent', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'designer', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'Compared', 'books', 'MacArthur', 'such', 'American', 'Caesar', 'MacArthur', 'very', 'short', 'devoid', 'many', 'details', 'make', 'movie', 'truly', 'told', 'story', 'Douglas', 'MacArthur', 'beginning', 'end', ""'d"", 'have', 'make', 'series', 'four-hour', 'films', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'half', 'Sargent', 'compressed', 'story', 'MacArthur', 'career', 'Bataan', 'Korea', 'very', 'well.MacArthur', 'was', 'outrageously', 'egotistical', 'dramatic', 'always', 'wanting', 'put', 'show', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'called', 'more', 'sensible', 'practical', 'thing', 'do', 'one', 'occasion', 'film', 'GI', 'stay', 'down', 'visiting', 'frontline', 'area', 'noting', 'unit', 'had', 'killed', 'several', 'Japanese', 'snipers', 'nearby', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'Not', 'disturbed', 'slightest', 'MacArthur', 'nods', 'approvingly', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'siege', 'Bataan', 'was', 'seen', 'more', 'once', 'calmly', 'watching', 'Japanese', 'planes', 'attacking-', 'standing', 'bunkers', 'film', 'same', 'recognition', ""'Patton"", 'enjoys', 'confidently', 'rank', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'performance', 'film', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'one', 'same', 'level', 'MacArthur', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'turn', 'making', 'cup', 'coffee', 'epic', 'saga', 'worth', 'writing', 'play', 'movie', 'part', 'superbly', 'brilliance', 'total', 'disregard', 'danger', 'enemy', 'posed', 'colossal', 'ego', 'incredible', 'skill', 'strategist', 'leader', 'remarkable', 'traits', 'build', 'five', 'star', 'general', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'recipient', 'film', 'becomes', 'unstoppable', 'force', 'Joint', 'Chiefs', 'Red', 'Chinese', 'North', 'Koreans', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'Harry', 'Truman', 'played', 'yet', 'superb', 'actor', 'Ed', 'Flanders', 'who', 'when', 'learning', 'General', 'flaunting', 'authority', 'destroying', 'attempts', 'establish', 'cease', 'fire', 'Chinese', 'ludicrously', 'arrogant', 'ultimatum', ""'m"", 'gon', 'fire', 'insubordinate', '***', 'right', 'now', 'MacArthur', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'gotten', 'used', 'having', 'way', 'had', 'finally', 'run', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'as', 'stubborn', 'was', 'Relieved', 'command', 'United', 'States', 'received', 'enraptured', 'joyous', 'American', 'public', 'conclusion', 'film', 'Peck', 'stunning', 'rendition', 'MacArthur', 'Duty', 'Honor', 'Country', 'speech', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'version', 'done', 'General', 'himself.To', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'learning', 'one', 'West', 'Point', 'most', 'distinguished', 'graduates', 'man', 'incredible', 'brilliance', 'unparalleled', 'strategic', 'skill', 'unquestionable', 'courage', 'colossal', 'ego', 'made', 'ended', 'career', 'highly', 'recommend', 'MacArthur', 'truly', 'lamentable', 'film', 'not', 'anywhere', 'as', 'famous', 'should', 'be']",N/A

This film is one of Peck's best, and it's sad it did not have more critical acclaim, as I feel it certainly deserved it.Other terrific performances come from Marj Dusay as his wife Jean, Sandy Kenyon as General Jonathan Wainwright, and Ed Flanders as President Truman is quite exceptional; tough, gritty, and angered by MacArthur.An excellent score by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Mario Tosi complements the well-paced direction by Joseph Sargent. If it has a flaw, I feel the film makes too much of the publicity loving aspect of MacArthur's personality. Yes, he liked to use the media to his advantage, and most people who make history feel the same way no doubt...otherwise it is a fairly balanced depiction of one of the great men of the 20th century.It is interesting to speculate what would have happened had General MacArthur been able to do what he thought was right, and not the &quot;capitulation&quot; and &quot;immoral compromise with evil&quot; he felt he was forced to accept. Perhaps over time millions of lives would have been saved, but I'm sure many would argue otherwise.Total running time 130 minutes.&quot;A soldier above all other people, prays for peace, for he must suffer and bear the deepest wounds and scars of war&quot;.",5,"&quot;duty, honor, country&quot;",1088553600,"06 30, 2004",2004,2217,"['are', 'interested', 'General', 'Douglas', 'MacArthur', 'admire', 'qualities', 'courage', 'fortitude', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'fascinating', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'marvelous', 're-creations', 'mid', '20th', 'century', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done.The', 'speeches', 'alone', 'are', 'glory', 'listen', 'full', 'passion', 'quot', 'duty', 'honor', 'country', 'quot', 'words', 'are', 'so', 'exquisitely', 'crafted', 'are', 'finest', 'prose.The', 'film', 'starts', 'ends', 'MacArthur', 'beloved', 'West', 'Point', 'blustery', 'day', 'cadets', 'many', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'others', 'are', 'landing', 'Layte', 'signing', 'Japan', 'surrender', 'USS', 'Missouri', 'Tokyo', 'Bay', 'fabulous', 're-staging', 'historic', 'event.Gregory', 'Peck', 'monumental', 'portrayal', 'MacArthur', 'nuanced', 'brilliant', 'old', 'film', 'clips', 'have', 'seen', 'General', 'MacArthur', 'subtly', 'posture', 'movement', 'many', 'different', 'pipes', 'film', 'one', 'Peck', 'best', 'sad', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'more', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'feel', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'it.Other', 'terrific', 'performances', 'come', 'Marj', 'Dusay', 'wife', 'Jean', 'Sandy', 'Kenyon', 'General', 'Jonathan', 'Wainwright', 'Ed', 'Flanders', 'President', 'Truman', 'quite', 'exceptional', 'tough', 'gritty', 'angered', 'MacArthur.An', 'excellent', 'score', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'cinematography', 'Mario', 'Tosi', 'well-paced', 'direction', 'Joseph', 'Sargent', 'flaw', 'feel', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'publicity', 'loving', 'aspect', 'MacArthur', 'personality', 'Yes', 'liked', 'use', 'media', 'advantage', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'make', 'history', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'doubt', 'otherwise', 'fairly', 'balanced', 'depiction', 'one', 'great', 'men', '20th', 'century.It', 'interesting', 'speculate', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'had', 'General', 'MacArthur', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'right', 'not', 'quot', 'capitulation', 'quot', 'quot', 'immoral', 'compromise', 'evil', 'quot', 'felt', 'was', 'forced', 'accept', 'Perhaps', 'time', 'millions', 'lives', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'saved', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'would', 'argue', 'otherwise.Total', 'running', 'time', '130', 'minutes.', 'quot', 'A', 'soldier', 'other', 'people', 'prays', 'peace', 'must', 'suffer', 'bear', 'deepest', 'wounds', 'scars', 'war', 'quot']",N/A

200104,A3DK5X66XYMTHO,630018157X,"C. Hutton ""book maven""","[40, 44]","The 1977 film of MacArthur is worth watching for the towering performance of Gregory Peck as General Douglas MacArthur. Peck considered this one of his favorite roles and fought with the producers over the screenplay and editing of the film -- and fought he should have because those very flaws kept this movie from being a great film.MacArthur lead a long, dramatic and heroic life during World War I, World War II and the Korean War. As a vain and brilliant military genius who believed in his own destiny, the movie focuses on the decade 1942-1952. The film feels like MacArthur's greatest hits: the set pieces of Bataan, ""I shall return"", his rulership of Japan, the Inchon landing in Korea, ""The Old Soldier"" speech before Congress and so forth WITHOUT pulling the various scenes together into a coherent whole. According to Peck, the original three hour version fleshed out MacArthur more before it was edited down to the 130 minute commerial version.Without prior knowledge of MacArthur's life, the movie would be confusing and lacking in the richness that was MacArthur's life. As one example, the various military situations are dealt with superfical, briefly and often without maps, so that one does not see the strategic brilliance of his Pacific campaigns. I highly recommend reading William Manchester's ""MacArthur"" before seeing the film.Should you see the movie? Yes, even a MacArthur at half speed is more interesting than most movies and Gregory Peck IS MacArthur. He was passed over for an Oscar nomination although that was interpreted at the time as more of a comment on the film itself than upon his acting.

200105,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,630018157X,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 1]","Douglas MacArthur (1880-1964) was one of America's greatest generals. He was the youngest person ever appointed as a Major General, held  positions as Superintendent of West Point (1919-22), Chief of Staff for the Army (1930-35), Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (1945-51), and Commander in Chief U.N. Command in Korea (1950-1), and was 7 times Silver Star recipient, and a Medal of Honor winner. He was so popular among the people that he was strongly uyrged to run for President in 1952, but he refused.A personality as big as MacArthur needed a star as big to portray him. Up until 1977 MacArthur had been played by Dayton Lummis (1955) and Henry Fonda (1976), and subsequently by Laurence Olivier  (1981) and Daniel von Bargen (1995). But it was only Gregory Peck who did the job right.Gregory Peck is a film icon, ranked #12 on the AFI list of Greatest Male Actors. He won an Oscar for ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (1962) and was nominated 4 more times (""Twelve O'clock High"", ""Gentleman's Agreement"", ""The Yearling"", ""The Keys of the Kingdom""). He was nominated for an Emmy in 1998 for the TV film ""Moby Dick"" for which he won the Golden Globe. He had two other Golden Globe nominations (""The Boys from Brazil"", ""MacArthur""). He made 57 films, starting in 1944.Nicolas Coster (1933) plays MacArthur's aide. Coster works mostly on TV and is probably best known as the Chancellor from ""3rd Rock from the Sun"" (1998-9). He had a recurring role on ""Santa Barbara"" (1984-93) along with Marj Dusay who plays MacArthur's wife in this film.Marj Dusay (1936) is primarily a TV performer, Dusay was nominated twice for an Emmy (""All My Children"" and ""Guiding Light"").Ed Flanders (1934-95) plays President Truman. Flanders played Truman in a 1976 TV special and won the Emmy. Flanders was nominated 7 times for an Emmy and won 3 times, for this film, ""A Moon for the Misbegotten"" (1975) and ""St Elsewhere"" (1982).Dan O'Herlihy (1919-2005) plays President Roosevelt. O'Herlihy received an Oscar nomination for ""Adventures of Robinson Crusoe"" (1954). He moved easily between TV (""Twin Peaks"", ""Colditz"") and films (""RoboCop"", ""The Last Starfighter"").The film is directed by Joseph Sargent (1925). Sargent has 8 DGA nominations for his work on TV and won 3 times (""Kojak"", ""Something the Lord Made"", and ""Warm Springs""). He also had 9 Emmy nominations and 4 wins. Sargent has made nearly 100 films, but mostly TV movies. For the big screen he made less than a dozen films, including this film and ""Jaws: The Revenge"" (1987).Jerry Goldsmith (1929-2004) provides an excellent musical score. Goldsmith was nominated for an Oscar 18 times and won once (""The Omen""), and for an Emmy 7 times with 5 wins (""Star Trek:Voyager"", ""Masada"", ""Babe"", ""QB VII"", ""The Red Pony"").He was responsible for 252 compositions over 50+ years.Producer Frank McCarthy (1912-86) did only 6 films, but they included  ""Patton"" (1970) for which he won an Oscar. McCarthy was a retired Brigadier General who worked as an aide to General Marshall in WW 2.The big block busters in 1977 were ""Star Wars"", ""Close Encounters"", ""The Rescuers"", ""Saturday Night Fever"", and ""The Goodbye Girl"". ""Annie Hall"" picked up 3 Oscars (Picture, Director, Actress) and ""Julia"" picked up two (Supporting Actor, Actress). Other notable films that year were ""Equus"", ""Eraserhead"", ""New York. New York"", and ""Smokey and the Bandit"". Several war films came out  in 1977 - ""A Bridge Too Far"", ""Soldier of Orange"", and Peckinpah's ""Cross of Iron"" focused on WW 2 and ""Twilight's Last Gleaming"" , ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", and ""Telefon"" were the spy films.One can't help but compare the two generals - Patton and MacArthur as well as the two films. Both men were Generals, served in WW 1 and WW 2, held commanding positions in their respective theatres of war, ruled their conquered territories after the war, and were known for great strategic maneuvers. Both were controversial and both ultimately were removed from command at some point for their differences with their commanders. The films, however, are much different with Patton clearly focused on the General's personality and MacArthur attempting a much more ambitious biography.""Patton"" won 7 Oscars (Actor, Picture, Director, Sound, Art Direction, Editing, Writing) and was nominated for 3 more. George C. Scott also won a Golden Globe. ""MacArthur"" received no Oscar nominations and Peck was nominated for a Golden Globe but lost to Richard Burton. ""Patton"" was #4 in the box office with $28,000,000 and ""MacArthur"" at $16,000,000 was not in the top 10.""MacArthur"" is clearly one of the best film biographies of famous American military figures. Included in my own list of top picks would be ""Patton"", Burgess Meredith's portrayal of Ernie Pyle in ""The Story of GI Joe"" (1945), John Wayne's portrait of Spig Wead in ""Wings of Eagles"" (1957), ""Sergeant York"" (1941), Errol Flynn's portrait of Custer in ""They Died with Their Boots On"" (1941), Spencer Tracy's portrait of Robert Rogers in ""Northwest Passage"" (1940).This is an excellent film, wonderfully photographed, with a great musical score. Peck manages to capture the many sides of a complex character, and this is one of our finest portraits of a military leader.",5,Excellent bio pic about a complex person,1306454400,"05 27,

200110,A1LVHR5OO45L5V,630018157X,JAG 2.0,"[1, 1]","This movie, starring Gregory Peck, follows the military career of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur from early 1942 during the fall of the Phillipines to his relief by President Harry Truman in 1951. Very little of his personal life is covered and the movie focuses on a small period of time in his career.Gregory Peck gives a fine, professional performance in his role as MacArthur and the movie itself is well-acted and directed in general. Locations, special effects, cinematography and score are all quite good.The movie itself gives a portrayal of MacArthur as both brilliant military commander and vainglorious ego. The movie, while not especially fair to MacArthur, at least does allow the viewer to see his military brilliance and hear his often brilliant oration. The movie recounts MacArthur's use of ""island hopping"" strategy to cut off and isolate significant Japanese forces rather than fight them at a high cost in casualties. MacArthur is presented as essentially a ""benevolent dictator"" during the postwar occupation of Japan. The DVD moves on to Korea where MacArthur's Inchon invasion is a brilliant and bold operational move which is negated by the Chinese invasion - which everyone, not just MacArthur, didn't see coming.The best scenes in the film are when Gregory Peck is able to convey the deep emotions of MacArthur at beginning and end of the movie speaking to cadets at West Point, coming ashore at Leyte and addressing the Fillipino people he loved as well as his visit to a POW camp for a long-awaited reunion with survivors of the ""Death March"" and a tearful reunion with Gen. Wainwright.The movie handles his conflict with and eventual relief by President Harry Truman in the standard fashion - which is to say, overwhelmingly from the Truman point of view. Truman was often vindictive and petty, relieving the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Louis Denfeld in 1948 over public disagreement regarding naval budget cuts. He even demanded the resignation of his own Secretary of Defense over a minor issue. Truman could tolerate little to no disagreement and often acted rashly in temper tantrums.Although the movie presents events in a less than fair fashion, the movie itself is not completely one-sided and it is certainly a well-made and acted film.

200111,A1OYW08VVPMP3Q,630018157X,"James D. Crabtree ""Doc Crabtree""","[1, 1]","General of the Army Douglas MacArthur was a great figure in American history, a character who has been tarnished by liberals because of his supposed disobedience to President Truman. His story is truly staggering.If anything, this movie is not long enough nor provides enough connectivity to establish a running narrative. The action (in the film) begins in 1942 as the end is nearing in the Phillipines in the face of an invasion by Imperial Japanese forces. One weakness of the movie is that it doesn't discuss Mac prior to this point in his life. MacArthur was a highly successful field commander in WWI. He was made superintendent of West Point. He was the controversial commander who sent troops to sweep away the ""bonus marchers"" from Washington D.C. He was made Chief of Staff of the Army. After he retired from the Army he was made Field Marshal of the Phillipine Army, which was just then being organized. All this and more takes place before the curtain is ever raised.In any case, the movie does follow MacArthur as he is forced to leave the Phillipines and the army under his command to its fate. Once in Australia he discovers that the U.S. government has no intention of attempting to recover the Phillipines. Despite this, MacArthur manages to turn the war in the Pacific around, engineering an offensive which would take him back to the Phillipines, as he promised.Next is the period in which MacArthur served as the supreme allied leader in Japan, working with the Japanese to liberalize and democratize its society. This is an achievement in itself and one hardly ever recognized.Finally is Korea, the conflict that would eventually get him removed from command. The back-and-forth tug between the five star general and the President is well-portrayed and I think is fair to both sides.I thought the acting was done very well and the chemistry of the cast does have its moments.

It feels like a the writers took a collection of his speeches, put them in order and filmed them, splicing some WWII and Korean war combat footage between them to build a narrative.Gregory Peck does a fantastic job of looking noble and heroic, and gives great speeches but never really comes to life; through the whole film he is stiff and dull.  We get glimpses of his humanity, and some of the final scenes as he is removed from command and watches General Eisenhower become president are well-done but for the rest of the film he is about as human as a presidential robot at Disney World.The script raises some powerful questions about MacArthur's ego, whether his ideas of war still worked in the atomic age and civilian control of the military.  But it passes over them with platitudes and never really challenges the viewer.The mix of recreations and stock footage from WWII and Korea makes the whole film feel cheap.  The stock footage is easy to spot and the recreations look like they were filmed in a studio backlot.

200115,A2NJO6YE954DBH,630018157X,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[33, 36]","The 1977 film ""MacArthur"" is well aware that there were two sides to the controversial military leader Douglas MacArthur, and you can almost see the makers of this film flipping a coin to decide which side Gregory Peck gets to show in the next scene.  On the one hand there was the brilliant military strategist and leader who directed Allied forces in the Pacific against the Japanese in World War II and for the first half of the Koran War.  On the other hand that was the vain and egotistical man who selected official photographs with as much care as he plained invasions and attacks.  Most of the credit in this film goes to Peck's performance in making these two diverse sides fit together for the most part.The contrast between the two is probably best captured in two scenes involving Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright (Sandy Kenyon), who was left behind in command of the Philippines when FDR ordered MacArthur to get to safety in Australia.  Even though he promises MacArthur he ""will be here or I'll be dead,"" Wainwright is ultimately forced to surrender and MacArthur goes off the deep end, insisting that Wainwright has gone insane and heaping invective on the man's name.  Later in the film, on the day the Japanese signed the articles of surrender on the U.S.S. ""Missouri,"" Wainwright arrives, a gaunt figure after years of captivity in a Japanese prison.  MacArthur embraces Wainwright warmly, brushing away all apologies and assuring the man he can have his Corps back as soon as he says the word.  MacArthur remains the same man, unconcerned by the obvious contradictions of his nature.Director Joseph Sargent frames this biopic with MacArthur's famous speech to the cadets of West Point, where he extols the virtues of ""Duty,"" ""Honor,"" ""Country.""  Beyond a brief look back at his early life and military career, the story of the film begins with the general and his besieged forces in the Philippines.  But throughout the film we are supposed to hear those words ""Duty,"" ""Honor,"" ""Country"" resonating.  MacArthur is forced to leave the Philippines, but he vows to return, and he does.  The UN forces are almost forced off the Korean peninsula, but MacArthur retakes it all before the Chinese get involved.  MacArthur is able to force FDR to go with his plans, but finds Harry Truman unwilling to go along, thereby ending a distinguished military career of over half-a-century.Which sides comes out ahead?  The ways Sargent tries to balance the two sides gets pretty interesting.  Both Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihy) and Truman (Ed Flanders) have their pokes at MacArthur, while it is a pair of his Japanese adversaries who speak to his military ability (scenes that are reminiscent of the Germans doing the same thing in ""Patton"").  The Presidents give the general credit for his military endeavors, but those accolades are buried beneath the verbal ripostes; on the political side the rebuttal comes from actual film footage of Republican Senators (e.g., Nixon of California) supporting MacArthur and blasting Truman.  Even stranger, MacArthur's aides are forced to play it both ways.  On the one hand they are doing everything they can for the general's public relations, but then there are also times when they basically roll their eyes at what is coming out of MacArthur's mouth.In the end, MacArthur is not only redeemed by Peck's performance, but by having the final two scenes of the film be the famous pair of speeches MacArthur delivered when he returned to the United States.

200121,A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q,630018157X,Priscilla Stafford,"[12, 14]","The movie ""MacArthur"", played by the great Gregory Peck, mainly takes place between the years 1942 through 1952, from MacArthur as a four star general to when he `retires' in the wake of Eisenhower's presidency. The movie takes you through MacArthur's historic events: leaving Corregidor, arriving in Australia saying those never to be forgotten words 'I shall return', island hopping back to the Philippines, on through the Korean War, then ultimately his retirement.I cannot express in words how wonderful Peck's portrayal of MacArthur was. He WAS Douglas MacArthur in every sense of the man. He played the part of the historic figure perfectly; where he was beloved by people, yet at times could be so agressive, straightforward, and outspoken that he made people clench their teeth in annoyance of that man (how do you think he got the nickname, 'American Caesar'?). A truly gifted actor, Greogry Peck will forever fill my memories of 'THE actor who played one of the greatest men of all time.'Setting aside Peck's performance, a few other honorable mentions are Marj Dusay as MacArthur's wife and Ed Flanders respectfully as Harry S. Truman. Dusay had few lines but instead, through her quiet courage and determination in standing by her husband's side shows indeed the importance she played as the faithful wife. Ed Flanders deserves much applause for his role as President Truman with a splendid performance as one of the many men who, though he hates MacArthur's guts, can't help admiring his military genius.In the historical point of view, I felt that ""MacArthur"" was fairly accurate, especially the depictions of the Korean ""Conflict"" (War). It portrayed just how much of a 'political' war it had begun, especially with the Chinese making it into an international incident.As for myself being half American-Japanese living in Japan, it was quite interesting to see how MacArthur began the reformation of Japan after WWII. I was also quite impressed with Yuki Shimoda playing the Prime Minister of Japan, and how he gave MacArthur full support in making sure that Japan could not again build a military force. That meeting between the Prime Minister and MacArthur was very touching to me.After watching the film, I also couldn't help but feel somewhat sad seeing how the world has changed from the circumstances of the past. After the Korean War, where communism was allowed to take hold of North Korea, the situation between North Korean and Japan is now somewhat strained, what with various incidents including kidnapping and illegal transportations. It is sad to see in the movie how this would have been prevented if MacArthur had been given leeway to finish the Korean War with a sound victory instead of the unforgivable option, the ""armistice.""All in all this is a wonderful movie that shouldn't be missed. There is one warning I would like to add which a few reviewers have also mentioned. The film is somewhat 'choppy' as in the plot moves along pretty swiftly. Unless you are very well informed about the years in which the movie takes place, there is a high possibility you would be lost as to what is going on. My suggestion is either 1) watch the movie with someone who understands the history of that time well, or 2) study the history before watching the movie. I can guarantee though that after watching ""MacArthur"", curiosity will overcome you and make you want to read more about those years.*Rated PG for some war violence. But in any case, best watched by older teens and adults so that they know what is going on. I guess this will lean more towards being a 'guy' movie, though for any girl (like me) who loves good acting and is interested in history will most definitely like this movie*",5,"""Duty, Honor, and Country...""",1097798400,"10 15, 2004",2004,3720,"['movie', 'MacArthur', 'played', 'great', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'mainly', 'place', 'years', '1942', '1952', 'MacArthur', 'four', 'star', 'general', 'when', 'retires', 'wake', 'Eisenhower', 'presidency', 'movie', 'MacArthur', 'historic', 'events', 'leaving', 'Corregidor', 'arriving', 'Australia', 'saying', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'words', 'shall', 'return', 'island', 'hopping', 'back', 'Philippines', 'Korean', 'War', 'then', 'ultimately', 'retirement.I', 'can', 'not', 'express', 'words', 'how', 'wonderful', 'Peck', 'portrayal', 'MacArthur', 'was', 'WAS', 'Douglas', 'MacArthur', 'sense', 'man', 'played', 'part', 'historic', 'figure', 'perfectly', 'where', 'was', 'beloved', 'people', 'yet', 'times', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'agressive', 'straightforward', 'made', 'people', 'clench', 'teeth', 'annoyance', 'man', 'how', 'do', 'think', 'got', 'nickname', ""'American"", 'Caesar', 'truly', 'gifted', 'actor', 'Greogry', 'Peck', 'will', 'forever', 'fill', 'memories', ""'THE"", 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'one', 'greatest', 'men', 'time', ""'Setting"", 'aside', 'Peck', 'performance', 'few', 'other', 'honorable', 'mentions', 'are', 'Marj', 'Dusay', 'MacArthur', 'wife', 'Ed', 'Flanders', 'respectfully', 'Harry', 'S.', 'Truman', 'Dusay', 'had', 'few', 'lines', 'instead', 'quiet', 'courage', 'determination', 'standing', 'husband', 'side', 'indeed', 'importance', 'played', 'faithful', 'wife', 'Ed', 'Flanders', 'much', 'applause', 'role', 'President', 'Truman', 'splendid', 'performance', 'one', 'many', 'men', 'who', 'MacArthur', 'guts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admiring', 'military', 'genius.In', 'historical', 'point', 'view', 'felt', 'MacArthur', 'was', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'especially', 'depictions', 'Korean', 'Conflict', 'War', 'portrayed', 'just', 'how', 'much', ""'political"", 'war', 'had', 'begun', 'especially', 'Chinese', 'making', 'international', 'incident.As', 'being', 'half', 'American-Japanese', 'living', 'Japan', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'MacArthur', 'began', 'reformation', 'Japan', 'WWII', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'impressed', 'Yuki', 'Shimoda', 'playing', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Japan', 'how', 'gave', 'MacArthur', 'full', 'support', 'making', 'sure', 'Japan', 'could', 'not', 'again', 'build', 'military', 'force', 'meeting', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'MacArthur', 'was', 'very', 'touching', 'me.After', 'watching', 'film', 'also', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'sad', 'seeing', 'how', 'world', 'changed', 'circumstances', 'past', 'Korean', 'War', 'where', 'communism', 'was', 'allowed', 'take', 'hold', 'North', 'Korea', 'situation', 'North', 'Korean', 'Japan', 'now', 'somewhat', 'strained', 'what', 'various', 'incidents', 'including', 'kidnapping', 'illegal', 'transportations', 'sad', 'see', 'movie', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'prevented', 'MacArthur', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'leeway', 'finish', 'Korean', 'War', 'sound', 'victory', 'instead', 'unforgivable', 'option', 'armistice', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed', 'one', 'warning', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'few', 'reviewers', 'have', 'also', 'mentioned', 'film', 'somewhat', ""'choppy"", 'plot', 'moves', 'pretty', 'swiftly', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'informed', 'years', 'movie', 'place', 'high', 'possibility', 'would', 'be', 'lost', 'what', 'going', 'suggestion', 'either', '1', 'watch', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', 'history', 'time', 'well', '2', 'study', 'history', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'guarantee', 'watching', 'MacArthur', 'curiosity', 'will', 'overcome', 'make', 'want', 'read', 'more', 'years', '*Rated', 'PG', 'war', 'violence', 'case', 'best', 'watched', 'older', 'teens', 'adults', 'so', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'guess', 'will', 'lean', 'more', 'towards', 'being', ""'guy"", 'movie', 'girl', 'who', 'good', 'acting', 'interested', 'history', 'will', 'most', 'definitely', 'movie*']",N/A

An Academy Award winner for ""To Kill a Mockinbird"", an Oscar nominee for ""Keys to the Kingdom"", ""The Yearling"", ""Gentleman's Agreement"", and ""Twelve O'Clock High""--he has played everything from an apparently homicidal amnesiac to a crusading journalist; from a troubled gunfighter to an obsessed attorney; from biblical David to Captain Horatio Hornblower... He has brought to them all his own unique insight, his character, his sincerity, warmth and love, and especially, his humor...There is a scene where 'MacArthur' stands on deck with the 'President of the Philippines.' We can hear the dialogue: ""General, I hope the water isn't too deep,"" says the 'President,' ""because my people will find out I can't swim."" Then come Peck's sonorous voice: ""And my people are going to find that I can't walk on water!""As ""MacArthur,"" Peck once again justified his reputation as a giant in the film industry... Through him we felt MacArthur's emotions: we knew his anger, his happiness and we understood the relationship with his whole family...",3,One of the most impressive scenes was the accurate recreation of the Japanese surrender aboard the U.S.S.

200130,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,630018157X,Roger J. Buffington,"[27, 33]","Gregory Peck does his customary stellar job in this very enjoyable movie about General Douglas MacArthur.  The film spans the time frame from the onset of World War II and the fall of the Phillipines (of which MacArthur was military commander) through the relief of General MacArthur in the midst of the Korean War.  The movie is notably true to history in all respects that I could determine, and deserves kudos for that.In my opinion the film is flawed because it goes out of its way to portray MacArthur in an unfavorable light.  It ridicules his skillful use of public relations, and presents MacArthur as a demagogue and as a somewhat shallow, manipulative, and downright political General.  The troops' dislike of MacArthur is overplayed--other great generals were not always popular with their men, but the fact is that MacArthur and his strategy of bypassing Japanese strong points (&quot;island hopping&quot;) worked, and saved countless American and Allied lives.  While there is perhaps some truth to the notion that MacArthur was obsessed with his image to the American people, the fact is that the country needed heros in the dark days following Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt knew it and served up Patton and MacArthur, and MacArthur knew it too.  In the early days of American involvement in the war, guts and morale were about all the country had going for it.The movie deserves praise for its portrayal of MacArthur's handling of the Korean War.  I don't recall ever seeing a more insightful or accurate dramatic portrayal of what happened in this underexamined war, and the movie gives MacArthur credit for his boldness and genius, and at the same time, in a fair and evenhanded way, the film explains why President Truman saw fit to relieve MacArthur.  This action was appropriate although unfortunate, and the film handles this episode fairly, in my opinion.The movie &quot;Patton&quot; is probably the model for how a movie should portray the life story of a great American general.  compared against &quot;Patton&quot; this film does not measure up.  Nevertheless, this film is well worth seeing and owning despite its flaws.",3,"Enjoyable, but a flawed portrait of MacArthur",1063756800,"09 17, 2003",2003,2140,"['Gregory', 'Peck', 'customary', 'stellar', 'job', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'General', 'Douglas', 'MacArthur', 'film', 'time', 'frame', 'onset', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'fall', 'Phillipines', 'MacArthur', 'was', 'military', 'commander', 'relief', 'General', 'MacArthur', 'midst', 'Korean', 'War', 'movie', 'notably', 'true', 'history', 'respects', 'could', 'determine', 'kudos', 'that.In', 'opinion', 'film', 'flawed', 'way', 'portray', 'MacArthur', 'unfavorable', 'light', 'skillful', 'use', 'public', 'relations', 'presents', 'MacArthur', 'demagogue', 'somewhat', 'shallow', 'manipulative', 'downright', 'political', 'General', 'troops', 'dislike', 'MacArthur', 'overplayed', 'other', 'great', 'generals', 'were', 'not', 'always', 'popular', 'men', 'fact', 'MacArthur', 'strategy', 'bypassing', 'Japanese', 'strong', 'points', 'quot', 'island', 'hopping', 'quot', 'worked', 'saved', 'countless', 'American', 'Allied', 'lives', 'perhaps', 'truth', 'notion', 'MacArthur', 'was', 'obsessed', 'image', 'American', 'people', 'fact', 'country', 'needed', 'heros', 'dark', 'days', 'following', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Roosevelt', 'knew', 'served', 'up', 'Patton', 'MacArthur', 'MacArthur', 'knew', 'too', 'early', 'days', 'American', 'involvement', 'war', 'guts', 'morale', 'were', 'country', 'had', 'going', 'it.The', 'movie', 'deserves', 'praise', 'portrayal', 'MacArthur', 'handling', 'Korean', 'War', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ever', 'seeing', 'more', 'insightful', 'accurate', 'dramatic', 'portrayal', 'what', 'happened', 'underexamined', 'war', 'movie', 'MacArthur', 'credit', 'boldness', 'genius', 'same', 'time', 'fair', 'evenhanded', 'way', 'film', 'why', 'President', 'Truman', 'saw', 'fit', 'relieve', 'MacArthur', 'action', 'was', 'appropriate', 'unfortunate', 'film', 'episode', 'fairly', 'opinion.The', 'movie', 'quot', 'Patton', 'quot', 'probably', 'model', 'how', 'movie', 'should', 'portray', 'life', 'story', 'great', 'American', 'general', 'compared', 'quot', 'Patton', 'quot', 'film', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'owning', 'flaws']",N/A

The screenplay for ""MacArthur"" follows a coherent timeline.  The story doesn't jump around without explanation.3. The relationship between MacArthur and Truman was accurately depicted.4. The cinematography was excellent.5. While the point of view is obviously sympathetic to MacArthur as a soldier, it does not portray the individual as a saint without fault.Weak points:1. Although the battle scenes were fairly well staged, at one point, some stock footage of a dive bomber dropping its load on target was inserted.  The only problem is that the silhouetted airplane is an F4 Phantom, which wasn't put into service until the 1960's.2. Truman's reasons for relieving MacArthur were not fully explained.3. There was little mention of MacArthur's service prior to Corrigedor.4. Although MacArthur was portrayed as having the final sayso in strategic operations concerning the Pacific Theater, it wasn't necessarily so.5. Even though the film's intro alludes to the image of MacArthur as a controversial figure, the screenplay does not adequately follow up on this idea.  Even though some light is thrown on his political ambition, MacArthur is portrayed for the most part as someone who, in some other dimension, could have been the CEO of some financial outfit.  The MacArthur Peck portrays does not appear to be the rather ruthless individual that at times, MacArthur was.I bought this film because one of the Marines in my unit was an extra in the Korean War sequence, which was filmed at least in part, at Camp Pendleton.

I admire Gen. MacArthur and am one of his fans even though people call him a crazed general. I think he should have been allowed to finish the job he started in Korea. If he had been given the chance, we'd not be stuck with a split Korea and a belligerent China. At any rate, this movie is one of my favorites along with Patton of course. Also the visual effects are not satisfactory mostly due to the technological advantages of 1960s. Like the scene where naval vessels are shelling Philippines and MacArthur along with PH president are observing the scene. It's kinda childish at best but heck, I like the movie. However there are some minor errors in the script (which I might very well be wrong and plz correct me on that):When Gen. MacArthur is planning to re-take Phillippines with Adm Nimitz and FDR, he (Gregory Peck) talks about the beach landings in Anzio, Italy. The Anzio happened in Jan and Feb 1944 whereas this talk of retaking Philippines took place in 1943, months before Anzio beach landing occurred. So there's one thing that's debatable.One other thing is where his aide approached him about the plans to drop the A-bomb on Japan and general says something about the biggest invasion of history and he is upset that it is gonna be done by an ""Air Force General"". Well, duh! Air Force didn't exist in fact until 1947. So I am not sure if the wording is correct there. Maybe Army brass referred to army air corps as Air Force. I don't know but it doesnt ring true. Again, I hope I am wrong. ;-)All in all, I give this movie a great rating for its superb portrayal of an American hero.",4,"Great movie, excellent actor but some minor factual errors",1234483200,"02 13, 2009",2009,1718,"['Gregory', 'Peck', 'excellent', 'acting', 'superb', 'here', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'incomplete', 'bad', 'Peck', 'was', ""n't"", 'admire', 'Gen.', 'MacArthur', 'am', 'one', 'fans', 'even', 'people', 'call', 'crazed', 'general', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'finish', 'job', 'started', 'Korea', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'chance', ""'d"", 'not', 'be', 'stuck', 'split', 'Korea', 'belligerent', 'China', 'rate', 'movie', 'one', 'favorites', 'Patton', 'course', 'Also', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'satisfactory', 'mostly', 'due', 'technological', 'advantages', '1960s', 'scene', 'where', 'naval', 'vessels', 'are', 'shelling', 'Philippines', 'MacArthur', 'PH', 'president', 'are', 'observing', 'scene', 'kinda', 'childish', 'best', 'heck', 'like', 'movie', 'However', 'are', 'minor', 'errors', 'script', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'wrong', 'plz', 'correct', 'When', 'Gen.', 'MacArthur', 'planning', 're-take', 'Phillippines', 'Adm', 'Nimitz', 'FDR', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'talks', 'beach', 'landings', 'Anzio', 'Italy', 'Anzio', 'happened', 'Jan', 'Feb', '1944', 'talk', 'retaking', 'Philippines', 'took', 'place', '1943', 'months', 'Anzio', 'beach', 'landing', 'occurred', 'one', 'thing', 'debatable.One', 'other', 'thing', 'where', 'aide', 'approached', 'plans', 'drop', 'A-bomb', 'Japan', 'general', 'something', 'biggest', 'invasion', 'history', 'upset', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'done', 'Air', 'Force', 'General', 'Well', 'duh', 'Air', 'Force', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'fact', '1947', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'wording', 'correct', 'there', 'Maybe', 'Army', 'brass', 'referred', 'army', 'air', 'corps', 'Air', 'Force', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ring', 'true', 'Again', 'hope', 'am', 'wrong', 'give', 'movie', 'great', 'rating', 'superb', 'portrayal', 'American', 'hero']",N/A
