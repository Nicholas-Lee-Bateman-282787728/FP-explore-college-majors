After checking out clips of the show on YouTube and reading comments about each season, I decided to follow my crush Daniel Sunjata and order the series.  I am so glad I did.  The entire cast is amazing, the acting is first rate and the mix of drama and comedy just keeps me coming back for more.  I am mid-way through Season 3 and have a goal to finish all 6 seasons before the final season airs in July.

1064339,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000OIOOUU,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[10, 15]","The third season of ""Rescue Me"" is good but it should have been better. It plays out like a Greek Tragedy in which two bros battle it out over a piece a trash, and even though we know where the road we are on is headin' we stay on anyways just to gawk at the carnage. And carnage we get, but the overarching storyline just doesn't feel as tight as it should. TV is still an emerging art form and the idea of stretching a story over 13 episodes (or 585 minutes) has yet to be mastered. So along the way we get very melodramatic and soapy subplots to hold us over. Some of these are misfires (Probie being gay) and others just don't make sense (Susan Sarandon's character stealing Franco's daughter). There is also a movement in this season away from the firehouse and towards the crazy Gavin Family. Tommy's uncle being in jail was the low point of the season. If we have learned anything from the first two seasons of this show it is that nothing ends well for these characters and don't expect anything different here. What you can expect is good writing, and when this show is on it is on. Notice the scene in the first episode where Tommy tries to convince his womanizing godson that maybe sleeping with his teacher isn't the best idea. The repartee is razor sharp and hilarious and represents to me why this show still belongs on the upper echelon on shows currently on the air.This season picks up with Tommy recovering from his son's death. To make matters worse his brother is moving into his old territory (Janet) and Sheila is pushing him very hard to settle down with her. Everything here is soaked in an atmosphere of impending doom, and who can blame them. 9-11 may be five years behind us but for firefighters death on the job is a common occurrence. And that issue of mortality is only enhanced when a fellow firefighter is involved in a horrible accident and one of their own suffers a heart attack. Tommy is left to wrestle with whether or not the risk of his job is worth the reward. Being a firefighter is all he has ever known and the sense of community in the house is bone deep, but is it worth a horrific early demise? Lou contemplates moving onto a boat, Franco takes baby steps towards becoming a lieutenant and Tommy wonders if he could make it as a house husband. In the end the point seems to be that sometimes your dreams and your reality don't mix, this works out very conveniently for the show itself but it is not a false point. I also have to say that John Scurti, who plays Lou, steals the season. His uncanny resemblance to my friend Evan aside his acting is top notch and raw at the same time. With him moving in with Tommy he gets thrust into the main storyline and makes the best of it. There have been some complaints about the show going soft this year and I can see that. Tommy and his pals can whine about the PC crowd shutting down their smoking, but the show has apparently bowed to that pressure themselves as smoking on screen was drastically reduced. It is also not as hard boiled as season 1 was, and the edginess is replaced with a taste for trash. But that's OK; this show is still a hoot.",4,"Prison Weddings, Murder, Rape, Sex. . .Who Can Say No?",1177718400,"04 28, 2007",2007,3138,"['third', 'season', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'good', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'out', 'Greek', 'Tragedy', 'two', 'bros', 'battle', 'out', 'piece', 'trash', 'even', 'know', 'where', 'road', 'are', 'headin', 'stay', 'anyways', 'just', 'gawk', 'carnage', 'carnage', 'get', 'overarching', 'storyline', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'as', 'tight', 'should', 'TV', 'still', 'emerging', 'art', 'form', 'idea', 'stretching', 'story', '13', 'episodes', '585', 'minutes', 'yet', 'be', 'mastered', 'So', 'way', 'get', 'very', 'melodramatic', 'soapy', 'subplots', 'hold', 'over', 'are', 'misfires', 'Probie', 'being', 'gay', 'others', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'character', 'stealing', 'Franco', 'daughter', 'also', 'movement', 'season', 'away', 'firehouse', 'towards', 'crazy', 'Gavin', 'Family', 'Tommy', 'uncle', 'being', 'jail', 'was', 'low', 'point', 'season', 'have', 'learned', 'anything', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'show', 'nothing', 'well', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'different', 'here', 'What', 'can', 'expect', 'good', 'writing', 'when', 'show', 'Notice', 'scene', 'first', 'episode', 'where', 'Tommy', 'convince', 'womanizing', 'godson', 'maybe', 'sleeping', 'teacher', ""n't"", 'best', 'idea', 'repartee', 'razor', 'sharp', 'hilarious', 'why', 'show', 'still', 'upper', 'echelon', 'shows', 'currently', 'air.This', 'season', 'up', 'Tommy', 'recovering', 'son', 'death', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'brother', 'moving', 'old', 'territory', 'Janet', 'Sheila', 'pushing', 'very', 'hard', 'settle', 'down', 'Everything', 'here', 'soaked', 'atmosphere', 'impending', 'doom', 'who', 'can', 'blame', '9-11', 'may', 'be', 'five', 'years', 'firefighters', 'death', 'job', 'common', 'occurrence', 'issue', 'mortality', 'only', 'enhanced', 'when', 'fellow', 'firefighter', 'involved', 'horrible', 'accident', 'one', 'own', 'suffers', 'heart', 'attack', 'Tommy', 'left', 'wrestle', 'not', 'risk', 'job', 'reward', 'Being', 'firefighter', 'ever', 'known', 'sense', 'community', 'house', 'bone', 'deep', 'horrific', 'early', 'demise', 'Lou', 'moving', 'boat', 'Franco', 'baby', 'steps', 'towards', 'becoming', 'lieutenant', 'Tommy', 'wonders', 'could', 'make', 'house', 'husband', 'end', 'point', 'be', 'sometimes', 'dreams', 'reality', 'do', ""n't"", 'mix', 'out', 'very', 'conveniently', 'show', 'not', 'false', 'point', 'also', 'have', 'say', 'John', 'Scurti', 'who', 'Lou', 'season', 'uncanny', 'resemblance', 'friend', 'Evan', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'raw', 'same', 'time', 'moving', 'Tommy', 'thrust', 'main', 'storyline', 'best', 'have', 'been', 'complaints', 'show', 'going', 'soft', 'year', 'can', 'see', 'Tommy', 'pals', 'can', 'whine', 'PC', 'crowd', 'shutting', 'down', 'smoking', 'show', 'apparently', 'bowed', 'pressure', 'smoking', 'screen', 'was', 'drastically', 'reduced', 'also', 'not', 'hard', 'boiled', 'season', '1', 'was', 'edginess', 'replaced', 'taste', 'trash', 'OK', 'show', 'still', 'hoot']",Rescue Me: Season 3

What I will say is if you are looking for a show that can make you cry, laugh, and feel fuzzy inside, all in one episode, then this is the show for you. In my opinion Rescue Me is the best original show I have ever seen on cable television, possibly all time. Rescue blows The Shield completely away.The actors in this show are phenominal, most are actors not seen anywhere else, but everyonce in a while a huge actor will make an appearance or two. But every actor plays their part exceptionally well. Dennis Leary is the star of the show and his acting is way beyond any expectations I ever had of him.As the previous review stated, this season does not having the shocking moments but it has just as much if not more intensity than the other two combined.This is by far the best show on TV!!!!!",5,Best Original Show In The History Of Cable TV!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1177804800,"04 29, 2007",2007,924,"['could', 'give', 'detailed', 'synopsis', 'season', '3', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'did', 'god', 'job', 'need', 'say', 'again', 'What', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'looking', 'show', 'can', 'make', 'cry', 'laugh', 'feel', 'fuzzy', 'one', 'episode', 'then', 'show', 'opinion', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'best', 'original', 'show', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'cable', 'television', 'possibly', 'time', 'Rescue', 'Shield', 'completely', 'away.The', 'actors', 'show', 'are', 'phenominal', 'most', 'are', 'actors', 'not', 'seen', 'anywhere', 'else', 'everyonce', 'while', 'huge', 'actor', 'will', 'make', 'appearance', 'two', 'actor', 'part', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'Dennis', 'Leary', 'star', 'show', 'acting', 'way', 'expectations', 'ever', 'had', 'him.As', 'previous', 'review', 'stated', 'season', 'not', 'having', 'shocking', 'moments', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'intensity', 'other', 'two', 'combined.This', 'far', 'best', 'show', 'TV']",Rescue Me: Season 3
1064343,A31YMERCR7IRXF,B000OIOOUU,John Temple,"[0, 0]","Denis Leary impresses me with his enormous talent and his riff on the stressed, mouthy, and ultimately flawed hero, Tommy Gavin. Both he and Peter Tolan have created a series that is human, comic, believable and ridiculous all at the same time - kind of like real life (only with beautiful supermodel girlfriends and wives).  If you've been watching from the Pilot episode of Season 1, then you know that Tommy has a drinking problem.  And a failing marriage.  And he is haunted by failed rescue attempts and lost loved ones.  All of that continues in this season.  More extended family members come into the picture and his relationship with Janet and the kids gets murkier.  The firehouse crew grows more eccentric and three dimensional.  It's a series about guys written by guys and it is exactly what happens when you put of bunch of working class men together in a situation where they are pledged to perform one task above all others.  The interesting take is that the show doesn't really focus on fighting fires, but it focuses on the victories and the losses of men who risk their lives for the sake of others, and the people that ebb and flow in their lives.I did not get the chance to watch this series when it was on broadcast TV.  Now that I am viewing it in Amazon Prime, I wish that had made it a priority to watch as it unfolded in a weekly ongoing saga.  As it is, I look forward to going home and cueing up the next episode.  Another great benefit of this show?  The music.  Whoever had final say on the soundtrack did a fantastic job of matching a alternative song to the action that was unfolding on the screen.  And the Von Bondies' &#34;C'mon C'mon&#34; as the recurring theme song?  Brilliant.I look forward to his next projects because I believe that he has a good ear for honest dialog, and he has a good handle on what makes motivates men to act as we do.",4,"Funny, tragic and well written",1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,1880,"['Denis', 'Leary', 'enormous', 'talent', 'riff', 'stressed', 'mouthy', 'ultimately', 'flawed', 'hero', 'Tommy', 'Gavin', 'Peter', 'Tolan', 'have', 'created', 'series', 'human', 'comic', 'believable', 'ridiculous', 'same', 'time', 'kind', 'real', 'life', 'only', 'beautiful', 'supermodel', 'girlfriends', 'wives', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'Season', '1', 'then', 'know', 'Tommy', 'drinking', 'problem', 'failing', 'marriage', 'haunted', 'failed', 'rescue', 'attempts', 'lost', 'loved', 'ones', 'season', 'More', 'extended', 'family', 'members', 'come', 'picture', 'relationship', 'Janet', 'kids', 'murkier', 'firehouse', 'crew', 'more', 'eccentric', 'three', 'dimensional', 'series', 'guys', 'written', 'guys', 'exactly', 'what', 'when', 'put', 'bunch', 'working', 'class', 'men', 'together', 'situation', 'where', 'are', 'pledged', 'perform', 'one', 'task', 'others', 'interesting', 'take', 'show', ""n't"", 'really', 'focus', 'fighting', 'fires', 'victories', 'losses', 'men', 'who', 'risk', 'lives', 'sake', 'others', 'people', 'ebb', 'flow', 'lives.I', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'chance', 'watch', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'Now', 'am', 'viewing', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'wish', 'had', 'made', 'priority', 'watch', 'unfolded', 'weekly', 'ongoing', 'saga', 'look', 'forward', 'going', 'home', 'cueing', 'up', 'next', 'episode', 'great', 'benefit', 'show', 'music', 'had', 'final', 'say', 'soundtrack', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'matching', 'alternative', 'song', 'action', 'was', 'unfolding', 'screen', 'Von', 'Bondies', '34', ""C'mon"", ""C'mon"", '34', 'recurring', 'theme', 'song', 'Brilliant.I', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'projects', 'believe', 'good', 'ear', 'honest', 'dialog', 'good', 'handle', 'what', 'motivates', 'men', 'act', 'do']",Rescue Me: Season 3

Durham ""Big Evil""","[28, 30]","The third, and arguably best, season of Rescue Me may have treaded on familiar territory, but it worked out with spectacular results nonetheless.  As the season begins, Tommy (Denis Leary) is once again seperated from his wife (Andrea Roth) who still holds him responsible for the death of their son, while Tommy's uncle (Lenny Clarke) enjoys his time in prison for murder.  Jerry (Jack McGee) copes with his wife's debilitating mental health, Sean (Steven Pasquale) gets in way, way over his head with Tommy's crazy sister (Tatum O'Neal), while Franco (Daniel Sunjata) gets involved with a vendictive older woman (Susan Surandon) who plans on making him pay one way, or the other.  The main storyline of this season though is the love triangle between Tommy and his wife, as well as his cop brother (Dean Winters), which naturally as one would come to expect, doesn't end well for anybody involved.  The season reaches it's boiling point (literally) as the crew appears to go their seperate ways, and Tommy lands a golden opportunity to run away with Shelia (Callie Thorne), and everyone's future comes into question.  While there aren't as many surprises and shocks in this season as there were in the second, the third season of Rescue Me features plenty of great moments, as well as great guest roles from Sarandon and Marissa Tomei, who make the most out of their screen time.  Leary is great as well once again, while the rest of the cast performs well to boot.
