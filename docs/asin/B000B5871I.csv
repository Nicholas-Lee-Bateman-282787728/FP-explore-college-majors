From the theory on disc 1 to the practical application on disc 2, this set is a complete health restoration kit.  If I go a few days without doing my yin yoga DVD, I physically CRAVE getting back to it.One of the best features of the DVD is the alternate audio.  You can do the sets without the instructor's voice and just listen to some nice, calming, ambient music.  Now that I've heard his commentary a dozen times it's nice to be able to not hear it anymore and just get some music instead.It's pretty amazing how a simple sequence of poses can rejuvenate your spine and add length to your form.  I need this practice like air or water.This is simply one of the healthiest things I've come across in a very long time.  It's so basic: decompress your spine for more vitality, good health and well being.  We should all be doing this several times a week.  It should be taught in public schools.I'm glad this teaching is available on DVD and I don't have to pay $60 to YogaWorks for a fancy/expensive seminar.  This is the best health investment you'll make and it'll last for years.",5,Best Investment I've Made in a Long Time,1243555200,"05 29, 2009",2009,1173,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'DVD', 'set', 'one', 'word', 'review', 'would', 'be', 'Wow', 'theory', 'disc', '1', 'practical', 'application', 'disc', '2', 'set', 'complete', 'health', 'restoration', 'kit', 'go', 'few', 'days', 'doing', 'yin', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'physically', 'CRAVE', 'getting', 'back', 'it.One', 'best', 'features', 'DVD', 'alternate', 'audio', 'can', 'do', 'sets', 'instructor', 'voice', 'just', 'listen', 'nice', 'calming', 'ambient', 'music', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'commentary', 'dozen', 'nice', 'be', 'able', 'not', 'hear', 'anymore', 'just', 'get', 'music', 'instead.It', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'how', 'simple', 'sequence', 'poses', 'can', 'rejuvenate', 'spine', 'add', 'length', 'form', 'need', 'practice', 'air', 'water.This', 'simply', 'one', 'healthiest', 'things', ""'ve"", 'come', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'so', 'basic', 'decompress', 'spine', 'more', 'vitality', 'good', 'health', 'well', 'being', 'should', 'all', 'be', 'doing', 'several', 'times', 'week', 'should', 'be', 'taught', 'public', 'schools.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'teaching', 'available', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'pay', '60', 'YogaWorks', 'fancy/expensive', 'seminar', 'best', 'health', 'investment', ""'ll"", 'make', ""'ll"", 'last', 'years']",Yin Yoga: The Foundations of a Quiet Practice

In just a few sessions of the spine sequence my flexibility has noticably improved, especially in backward bends.  Even something as simple as the cobra was difficult for me, and now I just hang in the snail, reveling in the front of my torso getting such a great stretch.  Grilley is an excellent speaker and teacher.  I particularly like the way he addresses the mind body connection, as far as fear, and how we can approach it. Anxiety is soothed away, as he assures us that slight discomfort can be a good thing.  I am slowly getting the confidence to release myself into the stretches more and more.  A great feeling!  Grilley does seem to assume that the viewer has substantial experience with yoga. I know there are plenty of ""regular"" yoga dvds out there, but I wish Grilley would add one more.",5,outstanding,1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,944,"['received', 'dvd', 'gift', 'am', 'low', 'intermediate', 'level', 'regular', 'yoga', 'late', '50', ""'m"", 'focusing', 'more', 'more', 'flexibility', 'just', 'few', 'sessions', 'spine', 'sequence', 'flexibility', 'noticably', 'improved', 'especially', 'backward', 'bends', 'Even', 'something', 'as', 'simple', 'cobra', 'was', 'difficult', 'now', 'just', 'hang', 'snail', 'reveling', 'front', 'torso', 'getting', 'such', 'great', 'stretch', 'Grilley', 'excellent', 'speaker', 'teacher', 'particularly', 'way', 'mind', 'body', 'connection', 'as', 'far', 'fear', 'how', 'can', 'approach', 'Anxiety', 'soothed', 'away', 'slight', 'discomfort', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'am', 'slowly', 'getting', 'confidence', 'release', 'stretches', 'more', 'more', 'great', 'feeling', 'Grilley', 'seem', 'assume', 'viewer', 'substantial', 'experience', 'yoga', 'know', 'are', 'plenty', 'regular', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'there', 'wish', 'Grilley', 'would', 'add', 'one', 'more']",Yin Yoga: The Foundations of a Quiet Practice

It's well worth it.It's a 2-set DVD.The first DVD is lecture on theory on Yin Yoga, learning the yang sequences, and special features including biographies, demonstration performances, and more. Paul Grilley is an excellent presenter. He explains in a very clear, complete, and sometimes humorous way the theory behind Yin Yoga. Yin yoga works on your connective tissue and not so much muscular stretching like other yogas.The second DVD includes the practice and has three one-hour Yin practices: hip series, spine series, and infant series. All practice is done on the floor and you hold the postures for up to five minutes to work on your connective tissues. It is a much different practice than traditional yoga. You will feel your body and bones open up. I love these practices and Yin yoga is a great way to balance out vinyasa or bikram yoga practices (Yang). For each of these 3 practices you have two choices of audio: either indepth instruction or just queues. What a great idea! Once you know the practices you won't normally want to listen over and over to the detailed instructions and this option allows you to do that. Paul leads the instruction in a very pleasant and complete manner.Also included on the practice DVD are three Yang practices running about 2 minutes each. These are a beautifual mix on vinyasa style yoga and tai chi. You have the options to loop each one individually or sequence-repeat in any order you like. This is a lovely way to customize your workout to whatever your energy level is for any given day.The final practice on the DVD is four routines with still photos and queues. Again you can mix and match how you want. This is lovely way to make your own practice without distraction of a class room setting.My acupuncturist recommended this style of yoga and I was so happy to find this DVD. It has balanced out my home practice and my Bikram yoga practice. The producers of this DVD have done a fabulous job of designing the interactive screens. I only wish they would have added some light music in the background, but you can always have a CD player at hand to add your own. Paul Grilley instructions are very clear and soothing and his students demonstrate for both beginning, intermediate, and advanced practice. Suzee Grilley demonstrates the advanced postures and she radiates them beautifully.I highly recommend this DVD for everyone.

This two disc set is a must have for all yoga teachers; it will boost your knowledge and your teaching skills.

935734,A46ROX2B7Q61Z,B000B5871I,D. Niedringhausz,"[27, 33]","Paul Grilley is not short on knowledge...the problem basically is his transmission of it.  Granted his presentation skills could be a bit more polished (not always adept at the paperboard...) and he tends to repeat, then reword and then recapitulate and 10 minutes later remind you of what he said.  Argh!  About 20 minutes could easily have been edited out of the theory section (the 1st DVD).  Furthermore, I do not understand why the Yang sequences were tacked on to a Yin yoga DVD.  I can really find them elsewhere with much more complete advice on how to move into and out of a pose. They are a combination of Vinyasa flow and Tai Qi with different names tacked on to the postures.  What he calls 'Sleeping Swan' looks a lot like Pigeon Pose to me.The 2nd DVD is better.  Again, he is a bit long-winded with the commentaries but since each pose is meant to be held for about 5 minutes, I guess he feels that he has to keep on talking.  He DOES at times have interesting points to make but I agree with the reviewer about the choice of his practitioners.  The young women can bend and stretch themselves like rubber bands...well, that's just great but it's a little hard to identify with them.  It would have been much more interesting to take an overweight person or a middle-aged person and then examine...what alternatives are available when you CAN'T get your forearms down to the floor on a wide-angle forward bend.  (Granted, once or twice he slips a bolster to one of the men).There are things to learn from these DVDs and I will certainly practice with the Yin yoga sequences at the end and will do so more safely...listening more carefully to my body.

935735,A1UQNX8S78JU0G,B000B5871I,Jessica Teel,"[71, 72]","I am a certified yoga teacher, have taught yin yoga for two years, and been familiar with Paul Grilley's work for quite some time.  Allow me to let you in a secret - yin yoga is simply holding standard yoga postures longer (2-5 minutes) and trying to relax the muscles during the poses.  There is nothing complicated about a yin practice, and it is particularly useful for beginners, the chronically ill, seniors, and anyone wanting or needing to have the time during a yoga practice to go deeply inward.  Grilley has renamed traditional hatha yoga postures (for example he calls pigeon ""swan pose"") so there aren't any new postures to learn.  It is the way of practicing these postures that is unique.I tend to dislike the packaging and branding of yoga ""styles"" as a commercial endeavor, however Yin Yoga: The Foundations of a Quiet Practice is extremely well done and worth owning.  One strength of the DVD is Grilley's detailed explanation of anatomy and theory.  He explains how yin yoga affects fascia and connective tissue and why practicing yoga this way can be so transformative to the body and mind.  The DVD serves not only as a practice tool, but as a source of education about the role of connective tissue and fascia in the body.  Grilley has brought the philosophy behind cranial sacral massage to yoga.  The results are transformative.The second strength of the DVD is the well thought out organizational format.  The DVD contains a stand alone lecture for background information.  The individual yin practices are broken into categories, such as hip openers, and there are also three yang sequences.  What is particularly ingenious is that the viewer has two narration choices for the sequences.  You can choose detailed narration with explanations and anatomical cues, or you can choose to have a more quiet practice with minimal narration.  Grilley is very skilled at narrating, and his cues and explanations are informative without being distracting.  I appreciate his emphasis on the individuality of a person's practice and that yoga is about making a pose your own.  Viewers learn that yoga is not about exactly imitating the teacher or following some preconceived notion of what a posture should look like.  With that approach towards yoga, he uses the models in the DVD to show how people experience poses differently.  For example he compares a very flexible model to a stiffer one, showing how in pigeon the very limber person achieves a spine stretch, while the stiffer person experiences primarily a hip stretch.  Do not heed other reviewers' criticism of this DVD as being inappropriate for beginners or seniors.  Grilley uses models with a range of flexibility, however the DVD could have been stronger if he used one model that needed the aid of props for certain poses.  His overall message of making a yoga pose work for your individual body will make even a stiff beginner feel comfortable trying a yin yoga practice.  Lastly, there are several bonus routines that feature only a still picture of the pose, and timed prompts to move onto the next posture.  This section is great for someone who knows the postures already, and is seeking minimal guidance through a routine.  This section really allows you to go deeply inward in silence.  You get a lot of bang for your buck with this DVD.  Grilley's lecture is similar to the $150-200 he charges for a workshop, and the multitude of practice choices on the DVD will keep you challenged for a long time.",5,Review by a yin yoga teacher,1181520000,"06 11, 2007",2007,3488,"['am', 'certified', 'yoga', 'teacher', 'have', 'taught', 'yin', 'yoga', 'two', 'years', 'been', 'familiar', 'Paul', 'Grilley', 'work', 'quite', 'time', 'Allow', 'let', 'secret', 'yin', 'yoga', 'simply', 'holding', 'standard', 'yoga', 'postures', 'longer', '2-5', 'minutes', 'trying', 'relax', 'muscles', 'poses', 'nothing', 'complicated', 'yin', 'practice', 'particularly', 'useful', 'beginners', 'chronically', 'ill', 'seniors', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'needing', 'have', 'time', 'yoga', 'practice', 'go', 'deeply', 'inward', 'Grilley', 'renamed', 'traditional', 'hatha', 'yoga', 'postures', 'example', 'pigeon', 'swan', 'pose', 'are', ""n't"", 'new', 'postures', 'learn', 'way', 'practicing', 'postures', 'unique.I', 'tend', 'dislike', 'packaging', 'branding', 'yoga', 'styles', 'commercial', 'endeavor', 'however', 'Yin', 'Yoga', 'Foundations', 'Quiet', 'Practice', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'worth', 'owning', 'One', 'strength', 'DVD', 'Grilley', 'detailed', 'explanation', 'anatomy', 'theory', 'how', 'yin', 'yoga', 'affects', 'fascia', 'connective', 'tissue', 'why', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'transformative', 'body', 'mind', 'DVD', 'not', 'only', 'practice', 'tool', 'source', 'education', 'role', 'connective', 'tissue', 'fascia', 'body', 'Grilley', 'brought', 'philosophy', 'cranial', 'sacral', 'massage', 'yoga', 'results', 'are', 'transformative.The', 'second', 'strength', 'DVD', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'organizational', 'format', 'DVD', 'stand', 'alone', 'lecture', 'background', 'information', 'individual', 'yin', 'practices', 'are', 'broken', 'categories', 'such', 'hip', 'openers', 'are', 'also', 'three', 'yang', 'sequences', 'What', 'particularly', 'ingenious', 'viewer', 'two', 'narration', 'choices', 'sequences', 'can', 'choose', 'detailed', 'narration', 'explanations', 'anatomical', 'cues', 'can', 'choose', 'have', 'more', 'quiet', 'practice', 'minimal', 'narration', 'Grilley', 'very', 'skilled', 'narrating', 'cues', 'explanations', 'are', 'informative', 'being', 'distracting', 'appreciate', 'emphasis', 'individuality', 'person', 'practice', 'yoga', 'making', 'pose', 'own', 'Viewers', 'learn', 'yoga', 'not', 'about', 'exactly', 'imitating', 'teacher', 'following', 'preconceived', 'notion', 'what', 'posture', 'should', 'look', 'approach', 'towards', 'yoga', 'models', 'DVD', 'show', 'how', 'people', 'experience', 'poses', 'differently', 'example', 'very', 'flexible', 'model', 'stiffer', 'one', 'showing', 'how', 'pigeon', 'very', 'limber', 'person', 'spine', 'stretch', 'stiffer', 'person', 'experiences', 'primarily', 'hip', 'stretch', 'Do', 'not', 'heed', 'other', 'reviewers', 'criticism', 'DVD', 'being', 'inappropriate', 'beginners', 'seniors', 'Grilley', 'models', 'range', 'flexibility', 'however', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'used', 'one', 'model', 'needed', 'aid', 'props', 'certain', 'poses', 'overall', 'message', 'making', 'yoga', 'pose', 'work', 'individual', 'body', 'will', 'make', 'even', 'stiff', 'beginner', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'trying', 'yin', 'yoga', 'practice', 'Lastly', 'are', 'several', 'bonus', 'routines', 'feature', 'only', 'still', 'picture', 'pose', 'timed', 'prompts', 'move', 'next', 'posture', 'section', 'great', 'someone', 'who', 'postures', 'already', 'seeking', 'minimal', 'guidance', 'routine', 'section', 'really', 'go', 'deeply', 'inward', 'silence', 'get', 'lot', 'bang', 'buck', 'DVD', 'Grilley', 'lecture', 'similar', '150-200', 'workshop', 'multitude', 'practice', 'choices', 'DVD', 'will', 'keep', 'challenged', 'long', 'time']",Yin Yoga: The Foundations of a Quiet Practice
935736,AU0LLORGK9IDR,B000B5871I,Julie H. Rose,"[130, 133]","I wrote a review of this DVD about a month ago and now am revising it because:I cannot say enough good things about it!  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.What's so great?1. There are hundreds of yoga dvds out there and almost all of them teach a variation of the sun salutation.  Thank you, Pranamaya and Paul Grilley, for breaking that mold!  Just for the refreshing change, I rate the DVD highly.2. There is a lot of information on these DVDs.  The first in the set has ""Theory"" (which I haven't even viewed yet, because I have his book) and the other has three hour hour long Yin practices and 3 Yang (flow) looping sequences.  You can also create your own series and have the choice of doing the full hours with either instruction and talking or cues and music.One reviewer said that this DVD is not for beginners.  I disagree.  As an intermediate yoga student, I've inadvertantly hurt myself doing so-called beginner practices from other DVDs that were for beginners on account of how fast they were moving; my brain and body did not hve time to adjust to the new posture, let alone breath into it.Yes, the holds are somewhat long (4-5 minutes) but these are not difficult poses.  Anyway, the point is not to force your body into doing anything it absoutely cannot do.  Grilley offers suggestions for alternative poses and explains how and why one would hold their body a certain way based on both your flexibility and your bone structure.I wrote this a month ago:I find the Yin practice to be wonderful.  I can feel my body fighting it's ""need"" to hold onto tension.  Most days, it melts away and I end this practice feeling like I've done a long meditation and had an invigorating massage at the same time.  What could be better?Now: after only one month, I am feeling and seeing the results of this practice.

Wow, was I wrong.  First of all the instructor does not stop talking through every pose.  He doesn't even allow you to experience the moves for yourself.  He keeps on giving his ""wisdom"" throughout each pose.  His voice is neither soothing nor relaxing, its simply irriating.  I will say I am not an expert on Yinyoga, but I don't think this was it, unless Paul Grilley is the one who invented it.  I could be wrong here.  The poses were difficult which is not a problem, but there was no real attention to proper body alignment.  The instructor simple told the participants to move in a way that was ideal for their body.  Well many inexperienced participants will simply do this and end up in the wrong position, and possibly hurt themselves.I am so tired of self expressed ""experts"" on yoga who simply make up a style of yoga, give it a name and sell it to us.  While this style of yoga included some of the ancient asanas, they were not qued properly and therefore their true benefits could not shine through.
