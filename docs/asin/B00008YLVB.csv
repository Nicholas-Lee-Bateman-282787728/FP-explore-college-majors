But my friends and I would play SWAT quite often.Now that I have the SWAT DVD I love it.  It's classic good guys are good and bad guys are bad and the good guys always win.  I enjoy the team work, action sequences, and get a kick seeing the 70's fashions and cars from my childhood days.I agree some of it is a bit corny and wooden and I think it's hilarious how they keep showing the same stock footage when the van is heading to the scene but it's no big deal to me.  There's plenty of good stuff in this series.  It's been fun to watch, especially since it was denied from me 30 years ago.I do wish that they had some extra features on the DVD but there isn't.  No character interviews, no background info, nothing.  They don't even have scene selection, you can only choose an episode or play all the episodes - bummer.  Maybe they can add some of that to the second DVD if it ever comes out.If you get a chance to read through all the reviews here, the characters that played Luca and T.J. also entered reviews - look for them!",5,Memories from the '70's...,1123977600,"08 14, 2005",2005,1169,"['was', '8', 'when', 'SWAT', 'originally', 'came', 'only', 'watched', 'part', 'one', 'show', 'parents', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'watch', 'again', 'friends', 'would', 'play', 'SWAT', 'quite', 'have', 'SWAT', 'DVD', 'love', 'classic', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'good', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'bad', 'good', 'guys', 'always', 'win', 'enjoy', 'team', 'work', 'action', 'sequences', 'get', 'kick', 'seeing', '70', 'fashions', 'cars', 'childhood', 'days.I', 'agree', 'bit', 'corny', 'wooden', 'think', 'hilarious', 'how', 'keep', 'showing', 'same', 'stock', 'footage', 'when', 'van', 'heading', 'scene', 'big', 'deal', 'plenty', 'good', 'stuff', 'series', 'been', 'fun', 'watch', 'especially', 'was', 'denied', '30', 'years', 'ago.I', 'do', 'wish', 'had', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'No', 'character', 'interviews', 'background', 'info', 'nothing', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'scene', 'selection', 'can', 'only', 'choose', 'episode', 'play', 'episodes', 'bummer', 'Maybe', 'can', 'add', 'second', 'DVD', 'ever', 'out.If', 'get', 'chance', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'characters', 'played', 'Luca', 'T.J.', 'also', 'entered', 'reviews', 'look']",S.W.A.T. - The Complete First Season

It would come on if I'm not mistaken either Tuesdays or Thursdays on channel 7 ABC at 9pm or 10pm ( I was young all I know is that it was past my bed time).My older brother was allowed to watch it. I remember coming down to get a drink of water and my brother was watching TV and I asked him what he was watching and he said SWAT so I as I got my water I came back into the living room and watched it for a bit and was hooked.

I was so upset.I always tried my hardest to sneak down and watch the show when both my parents were asleep. I didn't want to miss my Luca :[]I don't have to do that anymore .

Many of us who enjoyed this show were saddened that this show did not reappear in re-runs and thanks to the producers and the studio for 13 glorious episodes (three DVDs). Now we have the opportunity to view, entertain and enjoy this show. This is one of the few shows about a team of cops in action. There were several single cop shows such as Beretta; two-cop shows such as Starsky and Hutch, but S.W.A.T is the only one about a team.

This was one of those late-night, post 11 o'clock, imported TV programmes; and I can remember sneaking downstairs at the first shriek of the siren that introduced the theme music at the start of the show.The show followed the five men of the elite Special Weapons and Tactics unit (known as SWAT).

750406,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B00008YLVB,Taheen Lopez,"[0, 0]","Tough but not swaggering, serious but not solemn, S.W.A.T. was a police drama that ran on ABC from February of 1975 to April of 1976 and won over its 1970s television audience with several unexpectedly interesting elements: A degree of storytelling sophistication; visually exciting, guerrilla-like street violence; and a subtle but determined fascination with the psyches of the show's 5 principal characters.To a non-viewer, S.W.A.T. looked like a fatuously reassuring, law-and-order shill in the aftermath of the Vietnam war and Watergate. In reality, creator-producer Robert Hammer (a Peabody Award winner for the 1979 POW TV drama, When Hell Was in Session) managed to make an ideal, mid-'70s Aaron Spelling cop show with an extra emphasis on the human factor in peacekeeping.Spun off from an earlier Spelling series, THE ROOKIES, S.W.A.T. was the story of Special Weapons and Tactics, an elite branch of the LAPD assigned the most critical cases of urban violence in an American era of cult terrorism, snipers, assassinations, traumatized war veterans, and organized crime.Considering what the S.W.A.T. team is up against in every episode--shooters with sophisticated weaponry, psychotic revolutionaries, vulnerable takeover targets (nuclear reactors, etc.)--one might have expected the show to be swallowed up in gadgetry and fancy police protocol for extreme emergencies, but from the pilot (technically, a 2-hour Rookies episode not included in this set) on, S.W.A.T. was clearly much more interested in the way team leader Lt. Dan ""Hondo"" Harrelson (Steve Forrest), Sgt. David ""Deacon"" Kay (Rod Perry), and Officers Street (Robert Urich), Luca (Mark Shera), and McCabe (Jim Coleman) tried to understand the modern world even while keeping its meanest tendencies in check.Inventive stories with occasional twists and appealing guest stars (Jim Keach, Cameron Mitchell, Annette O'Toole) keep one glued to the 13 episodes contained here. Among the best: ""A Coven of Killers,"" starring Sal Mineo as a Charles Manson-like monster; ""Jungle War,"" featuring Mitchell as a career cop and war vet facing an emotional breakdown; and ""The Bravo Enigma,"" an apocalyptic tale of a curiously likable hit man (Christopher George) unknowingly spreading a plague through L.A.",4,SWAT Rocks!,1389312000,"01 10, 2014",2014,2267,"['Tough', 'not', 'swaggering', 'serious', 'not', 'solemn', 'S.W.A.T', 'was', 'police', 'drama', 'ran', 'ABC', 'February', '1975', 'April', '1976', 'won', '1970s', 'television', 'audience', 'several', 'unexpectedly', 'interesting', 'elements', 'degree', 'storytelling', 'sophistication', 'visually', 'exciting', 'guerrilla-like', 'street', 'violence', 'subtle', 'determined', 'fascination', 'psyches', 'show', '5', 'principal', 'characters.To', 'non-viewer', 'S.W.A.T', 'looked', 'fatuously', 'reassuring', 'law-and-order', 'shill', 'aftermath', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'Watergate', 'reality', 'creator-producer', 'Robert', 'Hammer', 'Peabody', 'Award', 'winner', '1979', 'POW', 'TV', 'drama', 'When', 'Hell', 'Was', 'Session', 'managed', 'make', 'ideal', ""mid-'70s"", 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'cop', 'show', 'extra', 'emphasis', 'human', 'factor', 'peacekeeping.Spun', 'off', 'earlier', 'Spelling', 'series', 'THE', 'ROOKIES', 'S.W.A.T', 'was', 'story', 'Special', 'Weapons', 'Tactics', 'elite', 'branch', 'LAPD', 'assigned', 'most', 'critical', 'cases', 'urban', 'violence', 'American', 'era', 'cult', 'terrorism', 'snipers', 'assassinations', 'traumatized', 'war', 'veterans', 'organized', 'crime.Considering', 'what', 'S.W.A.T', 'team', 'up', 'episode', 'shooters', 'sophisticated', 'weaponry', 'psychotic', 'revolutionaries', 'vulnerable', 'takeover', 'targets', 'nuclear', 'reactors', 'etc', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'expected', 'show', 'be', 'swallowed', 'up', 'gadgetry', 'fancy', 'police', 'protocol', 'extreme', 'emergencies', 'pilot', 'technically', '2-hour', 'Rookies', 'episode', 'not', 'included', 'set', 'S.W.A.T', 'was', 'clearly', 'much', 'more', 'interested', 'way', 'team', 'leader', 'Lt.', 'Dan', 'Hondo', 'Harrelson', 'Steve', 'Forrest', 'Sgt', 'David', 'Deacon', 'Kay', 'Rod', 'Perry', 'Officers', 'Street', 'Robert', 'Urich', 'Luca', 'Mark', 'Shera', 'McCabe', 'Jim', 'Coleman', 'tried', 'understand', 'modern', 'world', 'even', 'keeping', 'meanest', 'tendencies', 'check.Inventive', 'stories', 'occasional', 'twists', 'appealing', 'guest', 'stars', 'Jim', 'Keach', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'keep', 'one', 'glued', '13', 'episodes', 'contained', 'here', 'best', 'Coven', 'Killers', 'starring', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'Charles', 'Manson-like', 'monster', 'Jungle', 'War', 'featuring', 'Mitchell', 'career', 'cop', 'war', 'vet', 'facing', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'Bravo', 'Enigma', 'apocalyptic', 'tale', 'curiously', 'likable', 'hit', 'man', 'Christopher', 'George', 'unknowingly', 'spreading', 'plague', 'L.A']",S.W.A.T. - The Complete First Season

What a treat it is to finally have the first 13 episodes complete with digitally remastered audio and video. In my opinion the picture and sound are truly amazing and they have never looked and sounded better. Not only do I get to own Season One on DVD but I get to relive some of my childhood memories all over again with this wonderful set.This show made quite an impression on me as a 10 year old; In fact some of the other neighborhood kid's and me formed our own S.W.A.T. club. We outfitted ourselves with black t-shirts, caps and pants. We carried authentic police band Walkie Talkies and plastic guns and Daisy air rifles. I of course was T.J and many times I could be found on the roof of our house waiting to take down the bad guy's, unless my Dad was coming up the ladder to take me down!Anyway enough of that, If your a fan of S.W.A.T. you definitely can't go wrong buying this set from Amazon. Thanks to the magic of DVD and this amazing Season one set I get to revisit a little slice of my childhood when ever I want. In my opinion this 3 single sided disc set complete with great artwork and packaging is well done. Sadly the pilot episode that started it all has not been included in this release and that's disappointing! I hope that the remaining episodes from season two are on the way and some bonus material or the (original pilot) will be included this time around.From the moment the theme music starts and the S.W.A.T. van doors burst open you're hooked.

750411,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00008YLVB,trebe,"[5, 7]","In the mid 70's, cop shows flourished on network TV.  From the start, SWAT (Special Weapons And Tactics) was a controversial entry into ABC's primetime lineup.  The Spelling/Goldberg production was harshly criticized for being too violent.  And near thirty years later, this remains a program that requires parental monitoring.  This is not for kids.The testosterone rich SWAT team, is headed by Steve Forrest, as ""Lt. `Hondo' Harrelson"".  Confident, and capable, he inspires loyalty and molds the team to his will.  Rod Perry is speedy ""Deacon Kay"", his second in command, and pointman.  Springboarding from his role as a renegade cop in the film ""Magnum Force"", Robert Urich is officer ""Jim Street"".  Small but street tough, baby-faced Mark Shera is sure to charm the ladies, as ""Dominic Luca"".  Rounding out the team is James Coleman as ""TJ McCabe"", the team's sharpshooter.  These guys mean business, when they turn their caps around.The adrenaline begins to flow, as the SWAT van rolls out in response to a call.  The van doors swing open, and the team hits the ground running, with flak vests on and weapons in hand, scaling to the top of buildings, repelling down walls, moving into position, and taking cover.  The team is called on to deal with ruthless, and often psychotic criminals, motivated primarily by greed or revenge.  The violence is often taken to extreme and irrational levels, in order to justify SWAT's presence and deadly force response.  Anticipation builds, as once the team is in position, something is sure to break wide open.  Since there isn't much entertainment value in a peaceful surrender, a shootout invariably occurs.  Harrelson's team often does not follow realistic established police procedures.  Many times instead of containing a situation, and attempting to resolve things in a non-violent manner, the team actually initiates a violent confrontation.  The program usually has plenty of action, and some cool stunts, but also contains many inaccuracies regarding shooting techniques and the basic safe handling of firearms.  Pointing a weapon at someone, when there is no intention to shoot, is something that an officer trained in gun safety should never do.  Yet one of the team does this.  So don't expect too much insight into real SWAT tactics.  At times the team's actions seem more appropriate to a commando unit operating in a war, rather than as a police unit.  Just one standoff ends without violence.  And for some reason, women seem to get slapped around a lot.The program does stress the standard law enforcement ideals of justice, teamwork, camaraderie, discipline and sacrifice, but that's certainly not anything new.  When the SWAT team is not involved in an active operation, they conduct investigations similar to regular police detectives, and engage in training exercises to keep sharp.The thirteen episodes in the first season are presented on three DVD's.  Image quality is very good, though the quality of story writing is spotty, as realism is too often sacrificed in favor of the dramatic.  The episodes featured on Disc 2 emerge as probably being the best of the bunch.  Highlights include, ""Jungle War"", which stars Cameron Mitchell going over the top, as a renegade SWAT member.  ""Time Bomb"", an adventure in a movie studio, with Officer Street (the late Robert Urich) and his girlfriend (Heather Menzies, in real life the soon to be Mrs. Robert Urich), on the run from a group planting bombs.  ""The Steel Plated Security Blanket"", centers on a robbery attempt at a beauty contest.  Contestants include Loni Anderson, and future ""Angel"", Farrah Fawcett-Majors.  How dull the SWAT could be without the action and violence, can be seen in the episode ""Blind Man's Bluff"", where Harrelson becomes unfit to command the team because of an injury.The episodes are formatted so that you can skip the opening credits, which features Rhythm Heritage's energetic theme song, but the remainder of the episode has no chapter stops.

750414,A2BDQQ39DJ826Y,B00008YLVB,viewer,"[4, 6]","I grew up during the 1970s, watching a lot of TV crime shows, but never caught an episode of S.W.A.T.  Apparently, it ran for only one calendar year, spanning two TV seasons.  I ended up with the Season 1 DVDs by accident and only recently watched them.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  This was no silly, insubstantial Starsky & Hutch, another show I had not seen until recently but had a very different reaction to.I do not remember seeing Steve Forrest in other shows or liking what I did see.  He made a believer out of me in his role on S.W.A.T.  He does a terrific job as the strong, smart, dedicated, professional leader of the team.  Rod Perry is also a stand-out.  As Forrest's highly skilled, trusted right-hand man, Perry has great chemistry with Forrest and is very good at playing both light and serious scenes (though the twang in how he says his boss's nickname ""Hondo"" can be distracting; and where does the nickname come from?  The bare-bones disk set, which does not even have chapter breaks within each episode, omits the pilot episode).  James Coleman conveys quiet strength and expertise as the team's sniper.The professionalism, training, equipment, teamwork, and seriousness with which the men approach their work, reinforced by the dramatic opening and powerful theme music, capture the imagination.  In the show, the police engage in training exercises, test new machinery, are pro-active (as when an armored car is stolen and the team immediately begins trying to figure out how and where it might be used), and outsmart and out-maneuver, as well as out-gun, the villains.  The show uses the technique of featuring multiple crimes in one episode, which is also used to good effect in all of the various CSI series.  Somewhat like ""Old West"" feel of The A-Team, there is real fun and interest in seeing S.W.A.T. go up against the bad guys, who usually have skills and elaborate plans of their own.Showing a specially skilled S.W.A.T. team gave Aaron Spelling and people behind the series a standard of quality they had to aim for, which was good discipline and pushed them to more serious work.  Spelling should have embraced this, rather than reportedly disowning the show, preferring pure fluff programming.  The best episode in the 13-show set is probably the one in which the team protects a mobster turned government witness in the hospital.  Both the police and the criminals are smart, there is suspense and a twist, and Mark Shera shines, with an opportunity to show feeling in serious, well-crafted scenes.  The episodes about a jewelry theft from a beauty pageant and a coin heist are also above-average.It is easy to criticize the show.  Of course, there are repetitious gun-rack-emptying, running, and driving scenes when a call comes in and the team has to ""roll.""  But routine and procedure are part of police work.Setting the series in the fictional ""WCPD"" does not help authenticity.  The plain, baggy, baseball-style caps that the men wore may be authentic, but it does not help the dramatic effect of the opening freeze-frame shots to have Mark Shera's and Robert Urich's deadly serious but small-looking faces peeking out from under the caps like mice.  Sometimes the series and Shera seem to be trying too hard to show off his character as the team clown.  Urich is completely wasted by the series, coming off as wooden, self-conscious, forced, and extraneous.  Rose Marie's appearances as a hawker of cheap pastries and sandwiches at the police station, obviously meant to provide some color and humor, can get tiresome.The dialogue and interactions can be stiff and the characters and stories shallow.  This is often true of scenes with Forrest at home with the wife and kids and of the story-lines with ""personal"" angles.  Like Hawaii Five-O, S.W.A.T., at its best, is proof of a basic point.  If a show is done professionally, it can be entertaining to watch the characters for what they do on the job, which is how the public and peers see them in real life, and there is no need to constantly delve into personal subplots.Two shows are particularly disappointing.  In ""Time Bomb"" (included in the disk set as a first season episode but according to episode guides not aired until the second season), the criminal's plan never gets off the ground and much time is wasted on chase scenes around a movie studio backlot.  In ""Blind Man's Bluff,"" Forrest is wounded in an unconvincing, sloppy way; he responds unprofessionally and out of character; his replacement appears once, in one exaggerated, talky scene as a jerk, and is never seen in action; the role of the rest of the team is weak; and little goes on during the episode.Although the team responded to some interesting individual incidents, the episode in which a reporter was following the team around did not make much of that plot line.  The episode in which S.W.A.T. tracked an international hit man (played with gusto by Christopher George) suffered from the distracting complication that he was infected with a deadly disease and from an anticlimactic end confrontation.  Also, too often, as when a basketball team is taken hostage, the crooks put themselves in a box with little realistic plan of escape, making themselves too easy pickings and not enough of a challenge for S.W.A.T.  Regardless of these and other possible complaints, it is still fun and interesting to see how the team sizes up and responds to each situation, with Hondo barking out orders and the men expertly deploying their skills, weapons, and tactics to solve the particular high-stakes problem.Overall, the shows in the DVD set are good entertainment.  As to the hatchet-job review that boasted ""non-fan, fresh eyes,"" as though it was entitled to some special weight just for not having seen the show when it originally aired (neither did I), all it had to offer were stale, obvious, superficial criticisms and inapt comparisons to other shows, without any attempt to appreciate what S.W.A.T. does well.  (What could be easier than ridiculing the show for featuring a ""Charles Manson type"" as the villain one week, as though it was supposed to be taken seriously as the real thing, and with no mention of Sal Mineo's live-wire performance?)  Another review that trashed the series sounded like canned comments written without even watching the show.  For example, the review announced self-importantly, without any explanation or support, that the series showed no regard for police procedure and, except for ""one time,"" always shot first and asked questions later.  This is absurd; time and again, the episodes showed far more understatement, skill, intelligence, and discipline in response to a crisis than I had expected.If you watch the show for yourself, you will find that it had something special.  Even if, as some say, the quality declined in the second season, I hope some day (soon?) myself to be able to see the rest of the episodes of the series.",4,"Professionalism, teamwork, training,
