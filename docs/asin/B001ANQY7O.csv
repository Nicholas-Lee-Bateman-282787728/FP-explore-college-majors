1166400,A2UQJK29MKIPGM,B001ANQY7O,Allen Bowers,"[2, 3]","Like many of you I'm a huge fan of the first Lost Boys movie from 1987. And it proved quite the fond childhood memory for me and always will! But this piece of trash just won't fly! I mean you're joking right?! Unfortunately this movie was ""TOTALLY SCREWED"" from the getgo!! In the first Lost Boys they did the right thing by  makeing it a mystery as to who the vampires were. As if it wasn't bad enough that the surfer characters including Angus Sutherland were talking obscure trash to one another they just had to give away the fact that they were all vampires way too early in the movie!! All I liked about the beginning is that for the first time in 12 years we get to see Tom""Sex Machine""Savini play a vampire again! The problem is not only was it too brief a cameo but for some confusing reason Angus's character Shane and the rest of his vampires got into altercations with him and they ""KILL A FELLOW VAMPIRE!!! His half-brother Keifer's vampire character David wouldn't have done that. And yes Tom's small appearance was the only cool moment in this complete compost heap of a movie!! I mean the script was just dreadful, the acting was even more dreadful(to say nothing of all the performances being completely wooden), they completely wrote off the other Frog brother, Michael, Star, Lucy, and the other Corey was given a cheap, unneccessary and just plain CORNY small appearance at the end credits part. I mean you just can't write off everybody's favorite characters and ever hope to make it just as enjoyable as the first! SORRY!! What's worse is Corey Feldman's acting was not only embarrasing to the max and just didn't have one line that even remotely passed as funny but he was talking with that same stupid gravelly voice that he spoke with in ""The Puppetmaster Vs. The Demonic Toys!! WTF was he attempting a Stallone impression?! 'Cause if so he shouldn't give up his day job!! And even worse his character(Edgar Frog) kept on half bringing up this story about him having lost his brother Alan Frog somehow, but he neither goes into any real detail about it nor is there ever even a flashback. HUH?!! And in general the cast that they do work with are so bad that I hope they never act again. In particular Angus Sutherland is  every bit as handsome as Keifer but he neither possesses his talent nor Donald's either! LOL!! All that was good about this movie was the nudity that's it. Even though it was very cheesey the way it was presented. What I really hated was the surfer vampires first wanting to keep a low-profile only to tease and taunt the cops while one delivers a cheesey attempt to rip-off that famous line from ""The Warriors""! And also it was unbelievable stupid and disgusting when the vampires would for no apparent reason mutilate eachother just for fun. How SICK!! And why was there no explanation as to how they could later regenerate!! I just couldn't make any sense out of why no two vampires ever seem to die the same way either. Let's see we impale one on deerhorns and she turns to what looked like hail stones. And another after having a stake go through him is chundering blood and oozing what looks like shaving cream. And when shane gets killed we see a cheesey/fake looking special effect of him on fire?! Wait a minute I saw that vampire death the first time when it happened in the Blade movies!! And as for the deerhorns death well not only did that kind of death already get used in Silent Night,Deadly Night but also in the first Lost Boys! How Original!! LOL. And the soundtrack forget about it!! There were no impressive songs in the soundtrack at all!! All I'm saying is if you love the first Lost Boys as much as I did than definitly steer clear of this garbage all together! PS They also want to make a Goonies sequel and well considering how bad this sh** was ""let's hope they never do""!!!",1,Thou Shall Not Watch!!!,1226016000,"11 7, 2008",2008,3850,"['many', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'first', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'movie', '1987', 'proved', 'quite', 'fond', 'childhood', 'memory', 'always', 'will', 'piece', 'trash', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fly', 'mean', ""'re"", 'joking', 'right', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'was', 'TOTALLY', 'SCREWED', 'getgo', 'first', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'makeing', 'mystery', 'who', 'vampires', 'were', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'surfer', 'characters', 'including', 'Angus', 'Sutherland', 'were', 'talking', 'obscure', 'trash', 'one', 'just', 'had', 'give', 'away', 'fact', 'were', 'vampires', 'way', 'too', 'early', 'movie', 'liked', 'beginning', 'first', 'time', '12', 'years', 'get', 'see', 'Tom', 'Sex', 'Machine', 'Savini', 'play', 'vampire', 'again', 'problem', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'too', 'cameo', 'confusing', 'reason', 'Angus', 'character', 'Shane', 'rest', 'vampires', 'got', 'altercations', 'KILL', 'A', 'FELLOW', 'VAMPIRE', 'half-brother', 'Keifer', 'vampire', 'character', 'David', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'yes', 'Tom', 'small', 'appearance', 'was', 'only', 'cool', 'moment', 'complete', 'compost', 'heap', 'movie', 'mean', 'script', 'was', 'just', 'dreadful', 'acting', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'dreadful', 'say', 'nothing', 'performances', 'being', 'completely', 'wooden', 'completely', 'wrote', 'other', 'Frog', 'brother', 'Michael', 'Star', 'Lucy', 'other', 'Corey', 'was', 'given', 'cheap', 'unneccessary', 'just', 'plain', 'CORNY', 'small', 'appearance', 'end', 'part', 'mean', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'write', 'off', 'everybody', 'favorite', 'characters', 'ever', 'hope', 'make', 'just', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'first', 'SORRY', 'What', 'worse', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'embarrasing', 'max', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'line', 'even', 'remotely', 'passed', 'funny', 'was', 'talking', 'same', 'stupid', 'gravelly', 'voice', 'spoke', 'Puppetmaster', 'Vs', 'Demonic', 'Toys', 'WTF', 'was', 'attempting', 'Stallone', 'impression', 'should', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'day', 'job', 'even', 'worse', 'character', 'Edgar', 'Frog', 'kept', 'half', 'bringing', 'up', 'story', 'having', 'lost', 'brother', 'Alan', 'Frog', 'somehow', 'neither', 'real', 'detail', 'ever', 'even', 'flashback', 'HUH', 'general', 'cast', 'do', 'work', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'hope', 'never', 'act', 'again', 'particular', 'Angus', 'Sutherland', 'bit', 'as', 'handsome', 'Keifer', 'talent', 'Donald', 'LOL', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'nudity', 'Even', 'was', 'very', 'cheesey', 'way', 'was', 'presented', 'What', 'really', 'hated', 'was', 'surfer', 'first', 'wanting', 'keep', 'low-profile', 'only', 'tease', 'taunt', 'cops', 'one', 'cheesey', 'attempt', 'rip-off', 'famous', 'line', 'Warriors', 'also', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'stupid', 'disgusting', 'when', 'vampires', 'would', 'apparent', 'reason', 'mutilate', 'eachother', 'just', 'fun', 'How', 'SICK', 'why', 'was', 'explanation', 'how', 'could', 'later', 'regenerate', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'why', 'two', 'vampires', 'ever', 'seem', 'die', 'same', 'way', 'Let', 'see', 'impale', 'one', 'deerhorns', 'what', 'looked', 'like', 'hail', 'stones', 'having', 'stake', 'go', 'chundering', 'blood', 'oozing', 'what', 'shaving', 'cream', 'when', 'shane', 'killed', 'see', 'cheesey/fake', 'looking', 'special', 'effect', 'fire', 'Wait', 'minute', 'saw', 'vampire', 'death', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'happened', 'Blade', 'movies', 'deerhorns', 'death', 'well', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'kind', 'death', 'already', 'get', 'used', 'Silent', 'Night', 'Deadly', 'Night', 'also', 'first', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'How', 'Original', 'LOL', 'soundtrack', 'forget', 'were', 'impressive', 'songs', 'soundtrack', ""'m"", 'saying', 'love', 'first', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'definitly', 'steer', 'clear', 'garbage', 'together', 'PS', 'also', 'want', 'make', 'Goonies', 'sequel', 'well', 'considering', 'how', 'bad', 'sh**', 'was', 'let', 'hope', 'never', 'do']",N/A

And although the 3rd one is my favorite, I think this one was pretty decent. Corey Feldman was great, I really liked how the character was in the movie...(he should've been in the movie longer though) I really only had a few problems with the flick (but these aren't for the most part your average parts) I don't like the vampires....I am So damn picky when it comes to that you wouldn't believe it....(but I've been watching Vampire movies since I was 8 and I always know the best flicks.) Now although he wasn't like this big super vampire (and this goes out to the fans who always think the head vampire has to be like Terminator 2 vampire WHY? That's what I mean 2 by picky if they can play the vampire well, then we don't need super-charged Terminator Vampire) I liked how Edgar was a Surfboard shaper and vampire Hunter....and that shot where he knocked that one vampire girl out with the surfboard was pretty cool.....and I wish Edgar would've had that Tribal (George Clooney Dusk till Dawn tat in the next one, cause that was sexy! They had some great weapons 2....dug the blood....but I only REALLY hated one thing....the girl vampires brother....why is this guy an actor? I just hate him....So much I  fact I'm going to go thru all the scenes I hate with him in it. 1st off, after his sister drinks the blood he keeps saying in this whiney voice....you're just drunk....shut up...shut up shut up! 2nd and I know Edgar has to help him as a vampire Hunter but Why? I wouldn't help this guy...he's being a complete ass! So let's call him Vongeek like the Reality show guy in the next guy in the 3rd movie. AND THANK GOD! Edgar and this guy aren't friends because I swear I really hate him! He yells about the comics when they would help if he'd shut up for 2 seconds.... he doesn't know what any of the weapons are including a garlic Bolo (I've known that and every other Slaying weapon and I trained myself how to fight cause I always thought it was so cool. And you know what I would've really liked to see....When he comes to Edgars trailer...Edgar holds a stake up to his neck and he should've just shoved it all the way thru...AAAAHHHH! Okay rants over....something else I did like....I dug the lost boys theme remake, and the special Corey Feldman does on how to destroy all vampires was just SO awesome, I think they could've used  it in The Thirst just with that movie (it's on utube all the time 2 so check it out....just put in Edgar Frog's Guide to Hunting Vampires....well that's my latest review and even though it's early....Happy Halloween!",5,Sequals are strange,1380499200,"09 30, 2013",2013,2650,"['Hey', 'Sunnydale', 'girl', 'here', 'thought', 'title', 'was', 'cute', 'do', 'not', 'hate', 'flick', '3rd', 'one', 'favorite', 'think', 'one', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'was', 'great', 'really', 'liked', 'how', 'character', 'was', 'movie', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'movie', 'longer', 'really', 'only', 'had', 'few', 'problems', 'flick', 'are', ""n't"", 'most', 'part', 'average', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'vampires', '.I', 'am', 'So', 'damn', 'picky', 'when', 'would', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Vampire', 'movies', 'was', '8', 'always', 'know', 'best', 'flicks', 'Now', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'super', 'vampire', 'out', 'fans', 'who', 'always', 'think', 'head', 'vampire', 'be', 'Terminator', '2', 'vampire', 'WHY', 'what', 'mean', '2', 'picky', 'can', 'play', 'vampire', 'well', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'super-charged', 'Terminator', 'Vampire', 'liked', 'how', 'Edgar', 'was', 'Surfboard', 'shaper', 'vampire', 'Hunter', '.and', 'shot', 'where', 'knocked', 'one', 'vampire', 'out', 'surfboard', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', '..and', 'wish', 'Edgar', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Tribal', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Dusk', 'till', 'Dawn', 'tat', 'next', 'one', 'cause', 'was', 'sexy', 'had', 'great', 'weapons', '2', '.dug', 'blood', '.but', 'only', 'REALLY', 'hated', 'one', 'thing', '.the', 'girl', 'brother', '.why', 'guy', 'actor', 'just', 'hate', '.So', 'much', 'fact', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'thru', 'scenes', 'hate', '1st', 'sister', 'drinks', 'blood', 'saying', 'whiney', 'voice', '.you', ""'re"", 'just', 'drunk', 'up', 'shut', 'up', 'shut', 'up', '2nd', 'know', 'Edgar', 'help', 'vampire', 'Hunter', 'Why', 'would', ""n't"", 'help', 'guy', 'being', 'complete', 'ass', 'So', 'let', 'call', 'Vongeek', 'Reality', 'show', 'guy', 'next', 'guy', '3rd', 'movie', 'THANK', 'GOD', 'Edgar', 'guy', 'are', ""n't"", 'friends', 'swear', 'really', 'hate', 'comics', 'when', 'would', 'help', ""'d"", 'shut', 'up', '2', 'seconds', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'weapons', 'are', 'including', 'garlic', 'Bolo', ""'ve"", 'known', 'other', 'Slaying', 'weapon', 'trained', 'how', 'fight', 'cause', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'cool', 'know', 'what', 'would', ""'ve"", 'really', 'liked', 'see', '.When', 'Edgars', 'trailer', 'Edgar', 'stake', 'up', 'neck', 'should', ""'ve"", 'just', 'shoved', 'way', 'thru', 'AAAAHHHH', 'Okay', 'rants', '.something', 'else', 'did', 'like', 'dug', 'lost', 'boys', 'theme', 'remake', 'special', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'how', 'destroy', 'vampires', 'was', 'just', 'SO', 'awesome', 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'used', 'Thirst', 'just', 'movie', 'utube', 'time', '2', 'so', 'check', 'out', '.just', 'put', 'Edgar', 'Frog', 'Guide', 'Hunting', 'Vampires', '.well', 'latest', 'review', 'even', 'early', '.Happy', 'Halloween']",N/A

Soon, dark secrets erupt and fear begins to take hold. Enter Edgar Frog, surfer & vampire hunter, who helps in the fight to take them down. Taken on it's own merits, as a vampire flick, Lost Boys: The Tribe succeeds admirably with plenty of hard-rockin tunes, action and gore(alot more than was on the original, anyways). The story, although quite familiar, is riveting and interesting. As a sequel to the original Lost Boys movie from the 80s, however, it sadly fails to generate the same look and feel that made that movie such a hit. I'm all for continuing the saga of the Frog Brothers. I did get the movie, after all. But, if you're going to call this a 'modern reimagining of The Lost Boys'(as it says on the DVD box), for chrissakes-make it a 'reimagining' after all. That, in itself, might be what makes Lost Boys: The Tribe fail to be embraced by ""Lost Boys"" fans.Directed by P.J. Pesce, the movie stars: Angus Sutherland, Corey Feldman, Autumn Reeser, and Tad Hilgenbrinck. Horrormeister Tom Savini & fellow Lost Boys Alumni Corey Haim makes cameos(both storylines hinting at a third movie to follow). Special features include Alternate endings, 4 music videos, and the Edgar Frog's guide to coming back alive/Lost Boys: The Tribe Action-Junkies featurettes.My personal take on the movie, though, I really enjoyed it myself. For a vampire movie, it kept me interested the whole time through. I especially liked the videos for Yeah Whatever's Downfall and Hell is Full. It's a good addition to my vampire movie collection.

Yet, when it came down to it... storywise... the most interesting thing to happen was crammed within the credits. That's right... a scene inside the credits brought back Sam Emerson (Corey Haim) sporting fangs and a back story encounter with Edgar Frog (Corey Feldman). It was the only time in the entire movie that I had an ""Oh man"" moment and as soon as it started... it was over.What, was Corey Haim too wacked out on drugs to play a bigger part in the film?

1166417,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B001ANQY7O,Dave. K,"[29, 36]","First thing I wanna say is stick around during the credits as there's a brief scene; now with that out of the way onto the review.There's a lot of hype surrounding Lost Boys: The Tribe and fans of the original have been waiting 21-years for a follow up. There were plot ideas thrown around, but the movie never came to be until now. The original Lost Boys I personally don't know if I'd call it a classic movie, but is a cult classic and the movie is so fun and entertaining that it elevates the movie to almost greatness. The Lost Boys is a cult classic for a reason and now with Lost Boys: The Tribe expectations might be a little high.Simply put Lost Boys: The Tribe isn't as good as the original, which I think most people would assume going into the movie, but with that said Lost Boys 2 is actually a surprisingly fun ride. I didn't really expect much, but hoped for at least a fairly decent flick, but it actually turned out a lot better than I thought it would; like the original Lost Boys: The Tribe is campy and a bit silly, but it does step up on the gore and nudity.The screenplay by Hans Rodionoff wasn't bad, but it's never as fun and creative as the original movie and the characters are entertaining, but lack the depth like the characters from the original. But overall the screenplay was a lot better written than I thought it would be. There's some funny and creative moments and very much plays out like a homage to the original. Overall the script isn't without flaws, but works on an entertaining level like the original. The biggest problem is it relies too much on the original screenplay. If not for mentions of the first film this could actually pass as a remake.Director P.J. Pesce does a solid job with the movie and gets the best out of all the scenes for the most part, around the hour mark the pacing does start to drag in some spots and while it never gets bad I thought it might just start to fall a part, but it quickly gets back on track. Even when the pacing lags its still an entertaining movie just doesn't fully work. There are some good vampire action and fun action movies. While his directing credits may not be anything to write home about he does show some talent and makes an entertaining film.Angus Sutherland as Shane is the head vampire and his character isn't nearly as cool or as mysterious as David played by his brother Kiefer. That's actually the biggest flaw with the movie. Shane feels like a poor mans David and while a fun character he just doesn't really shine as much as he could have due to the writing making him too much like David. Angus Sutherland gives a fairly good performance, but he's still early in his career and has potential and seeing as his brother is Kiefer Sutherland and his father is Donald Sutherland I'm quite sure he'll be fine as his career goes on.The rest of the characters are a bit mixed; the vampires are alright, but aren't nearly as fun as those in the original and like Shane, the vampires are too much a clone of the original vampires and they don't work as well. They were fun, but could have been stronger. Tad Hilgenbrink as Chris Emerson gives a fun performance and his character was pretty good as well. Autumn Reeser as Nicole Emerson was a fun character and steals the show early on.About the only complaints I have with their characters is the same as I did with Shane's; Chris is pretty much a take on Sam and Nicole is a take on Michael. But both characters at least get a little more than just playing a new version of Sam and Michael, but a bit more could have been done, but regardless both characters work well overall.Corey Feldman reprises his role as Edgar Frog and bottom line is Corey Feldman is what elevates the movie. His character is the same as the original only older. Any scene with Edgar was highly entertaining and like the original Feldman plays it straight, which makes it so funny since both movies are a bit silly. But that's the whole point on both his performances. I've always liked Feldman and it's great to see him back. Even though Lost Boys: The Tribe is direct to video it's still a high profile movie and its great seeing Feldman in a solid role rather than some of the movies he's done the last decade. Lost Boys: The Tribe may not lead to bigger things, but it's a step up and Corey knocks it out of the park.Lost Boys: The Tribe is rather gory at times and it's a mixture of practical and CGI. But both really look excellent for a DTV movie and I have no complaints on the F/X and it's always good to see the red stuff shooting out.Overall Lost Boys: The Tribe is a surprisingly fun and very entertaining, while some parts of the movie does drag in spots it always remains mostly fun. It's not as good as the original, but that should be expected. Like the original it works on a campy level even if not as good. Fans of the original should enjoy this on some level as long as you don't expect too much you won't be let down. And if anything the movie is very much worth watching due to Feldman who really delivers a great performance.The DVD features 2 alternate endings both feature Corey Haim and Jamison Newlander. Newlander is listed in the credits, but his scenes aren't in the movie itself. Also Tom Savini makes a cameo in the opening scene.",4,The Two Corey's are back!

Rossi,"[1, 1]","Lost Boys injected a perfect blend of fun campiness with bloodsucking mayhem, and now in the wake of so many copycats and twenty one long years, Lost Boys the Tribe can only hope to equal the competition's fervor. And The Tribe does just that, equals but never rivals it's competitors. It's hard enough knowing that you're making a sequel to such a time honored coming of age as a vampire film. When you tack on the time frame since the original and some amazingly terrific vampire outings in other films, your job as a filmmaker begins to look like a more daunting task than being the next president elect. Still, The Tribe has some great moments with a much gorier band of blood hounds in search of their next victims and it's just not gonna be any good if we can't have our vampire hunter Frog on the case once again. Feldman does inject some of the film's best personality and keeps the frenetic action in check with his tongue in cheek please-take-me-seriously earnest belief that there are indeed vampires that need his services of a wood, metal and new carbon fiber stake wielding, holy water balloon cannon carrying vampire hunter. That's not to say there aren't other moments of humor thrust on the shoulders of the other actors. They are there, but sparse, as it should be. If you're looking for a ride as thrilling as you'll get in a vampire movie, see the original Lost Boys. There's also a cameo appearance from Corey Haim, so watch for that. If you're in need of a new dose of campy, humorous blood splatter, Lost Boys The Tribe won't disappoint. The tribe: 3.25 stars, the original Lost Boys: 3.75 stars",3,vampire thrill seekers? Hmmm....

It should be in the $10-$12 range.If you watch the Two Coreys tv show they spent about 2 episodes talking about making this film and how difficult Haim was being. They had to beg him to be in the movie. Well they basically cut him out of the movie. I don't want to spoil the movie but Haim is only in it for about 30 seconds. Watching the first one then this it's sad seeing what Haim has come to. Feldman was actually goodin reprising his role. The guy who played his Frog brother was cut out of the film for some reason but they still gave him a screen credit. I thought Kiefer's younger brother Angus Sutherland was good in the roll of head vampire.I'm glad I saw it. I can watch the original again every once in a while.

Sounds like someone is trying to cash in on a name to me. But for some reason, I still pre-ordered it, for $10 mind you. Then the early reviews starting rolling in, and they basically called it a disaster. My expectations went from low to nonexistent in a heartbeat. So it comes in the mail and I watch it, here's the formula: Take the original Lost Boys, keep this one pretty much the same, but add more gore and sex. Next, take out the really cool soundtrack and replace it with a really bad one. Then replace the cool vampires with really lame Buffy vampires who play too many video games and emulate Jackass. Sprinkle in some bad acting and a borderline annoying female lead, and you have Lost Boys: The Tribe. All that being said, it really wasn't that bad, calling it an average movie is being a little generous but I will leave it as such. It's insulting to have this movie bear the Lost Boys name, because it does not have nearly the same heart or atmosphere. But as a vampire movie, you're looking at a mediocre horror version of Laguna Beach, or the OC or some other equally horrible show. I can not solidly recommend it, but I can say that it does have some nice gore and Corey Feldman does a nice job as Edgar Frog. Remember how he was in the original? Cheesy and fun? Same thing here, good job Corey. And revealing anything else would be a spoiler.

Lost Boys 2 lacks all of these qualities.  The movie tries to be funny; it isn't.  It tries to be scary; it isn't that, either.  Corey Feldman, who reprises his original role of Edgar Frog, appears in this film.  He looks older than the original Nosferatu, but I digress.This movie is just one big old mess. We've returned to Luna Bay, CA, with a brother and sister, where vampires still have cool parties, kill lots of people, and no one notices or cares.  These particular vampires just happen to be surfers.  They, uh, surf a lot and eat people.  That's about it.  Characters are introduced for no reason except to become victims or get naked.  I suppose that would suffice for 13-year old males with raging libidos, but for anyone with an average IQ, that's gonna' get old after a very short time.  There is absolutely no cohesion to the story.  You're given several characters that you don't care about.The only ingratiating thing I can say about this movie was that I rented it.

It was really okay.Straight-to-video horror has this motif where gory or crazy scenes are sped up. It looks dumb, but for some reason it's done here, as well. Strike one.The script was awful. There are so many nods to the first one that the movie begins to feel like a cheap knock-off rather than a sequel. The big scene in the credits was cool but made little sense. And the Allan Frog scenes were deleted. Strike two.Strike three would have been weak characters, but I remembered that, like the first one, the characters reflect what passes for cool at the time. So it ulimately makes sense that the vampires are interchangeable party animals with no depth, or that the head vampire, a surprisingly good character, dresses like he's off to some vamp club. By faulting the movie for that would be a social commentary, not so much the writers' faults here.Feldman's scenes are the best, as others here have stated.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 2]","It amazes me that it took a whole TWENTY-ONE years for Hollywood to churn out a rotten sequel to the classic 1980s vampire movie, ""The Lost Boys.""But they did. God help us, they did.And ""Lost Boys: The Tribe"" frankly feels less like a sequel to the original movie than it does a generic half-baked vampire romance with a single ""Lost Boys"" character shoehorned in -- lots of sex, nudity, pointless gore, and a teen girl being romanced by a tousle-haired vampire. It doesn't help that the acting is almost uniformly wretched, led by a spectacularly unspectacular role by Angus Sutherland.After the death of their parents, ex-surfer Chris Emerson (Tad Hilgenbrink) and his younger sister Nicole (Autumn Reeser) move in with their aunt. On their first night, they go to a party thrown by another ex-surfer, Shane Powers (Angus Sutherland), and his ""tribe"" of equally likable followers. It isn't really a spoiler to say that they're vampires, and Shane slips Nicole a bit of his blood, which starts her transformation into a full-blown bloodsucker.Fortunately, surfboard shaper/vampire hunter Edgar Frog (Corey Feldman) shows up to help Chris, announcing that Nicole can be saved if Chris can kill Shane. But Shane has his eye on Chris as the next member of his tribe, and Chris immediately wants the eternal youth and life that the vampires have to offer. Will Chris save himself and his sister? Do I even want him to?Suffice to say, ""Lost Boys: The Tribe"" is not as good as the original ""Lost Boys."" This is a vampire movie for people who like ""Twilight,"" but want more sex, boobs and gore. The only real remnant of the first movie is the presence of Edgar Frog, and frankly he seems more like an extended cameo. He pops up occasionally, then vanishes for several scenes at a time.But this movie isn't just a bad sequel. It's a bad vampire movie overall -- a witless, meandering mess of bad dialogue (""Do you know what it's like for me to want to drink blood?... I'm a vegetarian!""), unfunny ""humor"" (the vampires like to stab and eviscerate each other for fun) and awful romance. I do not want to see a sensitive tousle-haired boy vampire taking his girlfriend on a nighttime motorcycle ride, okay? If I want that sort of thing, I will watch ""Twilight.""It doesn't help that I hated all the characters except Edgar. Emerson is only memorable for looking slightly like Seann William Scott, and his character is a misogynistic horndog who is too stupid to figure out that DERP! being a vampire means KILLING PEOPLE. Autumn Reeser does nothing but whine and screech, and is completely ruled by her hormones. Hmm, becoming a vampire? That's okay if she gets a hot boyfriend!But the cherry on the bad-acting sundae is Sutherland, who was clearly hired only because he's Kiefer Sutherland's brother. This guy has the acting ability of a lump of concrete, but less charisma -- he just stands around smirking and mumbling in a monotone, like a blond male version of Kristen Stewart.""Lost Boys: The Tribe"" is not just a bad sequel, but a wretchedly stupid vampire movie in its own right.

But should you still watch it?  Sure.  Its a great, entertaining movie as far as that is concerned, but it does not provide the realistic and cinematic ground work that the original was able to produce.It felt to me like a great, made for tv movie - which it pretty much is.  But it still should be watched, and will probably be appreciated by fans of the original and cherished as an amusing movie by others who are not fans of the original.So in closing, this movie is not the original - very true.  We know that going into it - its a new story, rehashing old ideas and blending new and modern ideas into a classic tale that audiences have loved since they first viewed the original Lost Boys movie back in 80's.

These days, when you watch a sequel or a remake of some grand old classic, you get junk. This is a prime example. The movie is so low-budgeted, it would barely make a showing on the Sci-Fi Channel, notorious for its wretched line-up of originals. In this movie, there's no suspense, as there was in the first, as to who the vampires of. In the original, we were teased and treated like intelligent movie buffs. In this one, it's just thrown into your face. We're asked to believe that even vampires go around butchering their buddies, for fun, since we all know they can regenerate themselves.But to splice open the chest of a fellow cohort and then stagger around whooping and laughing as the victim grunts and curses and then he somehow reforms himself. The brother and sister are totally unlikable for their idiocy. We're asked to believe that the hero is so erotically turned on by this skanky, sluttish girl that he makes out with her--knowing that she's a vampire. And of course, he becomes one. And then his sister becomes one.It's like the people behind this sequel geared it for the mentally retarded or the very young male, in his early teens, who might dig all this sluttish rolling around.Oh, for the days, when we were given occasional brilliant sequels and remakes of our old favorites.

You have 2 teens that move in with their some-what looney aunt, instead of a nutty Grandfather. The teen sister who we'll just call a Hilary Duff look alike falls in with a bad crowd who just happen to be vampires. Her protective older brother who we'll just call a James Marsden look alike tries to save her before she makes her first kill and is a vampire forever. He gets help from Edgar Frog (Corey Feldman) who knows a thing or 2 about killing vampires, hell he's now a complete vampire slayer.The formula is the same but there's so little talent in the movie that Corey Feldman is the only actor worth actually watching the movie for. I know, now that's sad lol. Look for Corey Haim in the two alternate endings. He tries to look cool but he's still a dork lol. Still , they should have kept his scene in the movie because sadly, it's better than anything in the movie.The gore in the movie is over-done and stupid. While the lead vampire looks like he just got done doing a photo shoot. He's not scary and is certainly no Kiefer Sutherland....even though he's his younger brother in real life. I should also mention that the sex scene is also done to same music as the sex scene from the original movie. It's a lot less sexy, especially since you have shots of the head vampire making faces of pleasure. Which is another reason why I didn't take him that seriously lol.The best thing about the movie is it's sense of humor when it actually has one. It's not a big laugh, but I did get a kick out of a fat guy with a pony tale shirtless with the same instrument and look as the buff concert star in the beginning of the original film. Maybe, years later it's even the same guy and he let himself go lol. You also have a scene where the Aunt wants to sit down and watch Goonies.  She says something like ""I can't believe you haven't seen Goonies, it's a must see"". It is a childhood favorite of mine but still I wonder if Corey Feldman wrote that line...lol. I also got a small chuckle out of the very end even if it's not as funny and smart as the ending of the original. Still though, it's sad that Lost Boys 2 is nothing but a made for dvd sequel.

I love it!This movie attempted to ""remake"" certain aspects of the original film and throw in Edger Frog (Corey Feldman) in a cameo role. The problem here is that Edger and Sam (Corey Haim) should have been the leads in this film.As a Lost Boys movie, this movie fails, and only deserves 2.5/5 stars. I gave it an extra half because of Feldman reprising his role as Edger. He did a great job and had some good one liners.Whats confusing is onceLost Boys: The Thirstwas released it seemed to ignore SOME aspects of this film, while keeping other aspects of it, making it confusing as to if this is a direct sequel to 1 or 2...Also, Corey Haim is only in the movie for 2 minutes at the end, after the credits start rolling. It sucks that he didn't get a bigger part. Its rumored (via The Two Corey's show) that he had started taking drugs again and his role was made smaller, and a lot of his other stuff cut from the film (which some you can see on the DVD's special features.) He really should have been one of the leads in the film, or at least he should have been the person who took the kids in - not some unknown aunt.To those of you who absolutely hated this movie, give it another shot or two. I hated it with a passion on my first viewing and then a few months later gave it another try and knowing what to expect in it I didn't find it all that bad...as a standalone film.If you want a really in depth review of this film, please check out my horror movie/book review blog listed in my profile here on Amazon.

The story was solid, character development was decent, and the FX were damn good for another no-budget, straight to DVD horror movie.

I think it would have been a much better movie if they would have stayed away from the ""Lost Boys"" title and just let it stand on it's own.  But I would say that it's worth the rental price if you like good bloody vampire films, with some good comic relief.

The GOOD: More Gen-X attitude - Raw nudity, wrecklessness and youtube generation, the pre-initiation scene with the local police,the beach party massacre, rock remake of cry little sister, Edgar Frog 80's cliche character. And now the BAD: Predictable plot ( girl doesn't listen to brother, girl falls in love with bad guy, girl becomes victim ), the love scene wasn't as passionate as original, it had different circumstances and should not have tried to be duplicated, too much blood and gore except the beach fire massacre, the vamp gang acting like immature brats than cool, no real back story of the original the characters last name emerson just like the original what ties do they truly have ( Sam &lt;Corey Haim> should have been in it more, drugs or not ), where the hell is the other Frog brother ?, should have kept the original music as well as the new, the lost boys were made the life of the party when they were actually outcast in the original, am surprised any feminist groups didn't boycott this movie like they do others, because the women were made to look as sex objects and just victims, again it is ""lost boys"", besides the song, where does sister come in anyway ?Things they should have changed: The gang killed another vampire in the beginning but the writers didn't capitalize on that, that would have been a good direction, more members in the group which have led to more action, not party boys - outcast, misfits, no sister act, more corey haim, character back story, and wheres the other Frog ( deleted scene )?!As a die hard fan of the original, I was dissappointed in the finished product, but mainly because of the name sake, and the plot line.

1166455,A3JHKXQG0Z6DK9,B001ANQY7O,Michael Stouffer,"[49, 51]","Although I am a big fan of the original ""Lost Boys"", I went into this movie with a VERY open mind and with no real expectations. I just hoped that the film was, at the very least, watchable. Well let me just say, BARELY. This movie isn't good. Period. It's poorly executed - sequel or no sequel. The pacing is off. The direction is amateurish - like ""The Grudge"" or ""Pulse"" meets a bad MTV video. The movie uses gratuitous nudity and language to try and make up for the fact that it sucks, yet it brings out the film's flaws even that much more. The original ""Lost Boys"" didn't need extreme gore or nudity because it was relying on other things like a good story and good acting. This story is just a rehash of the first ""Lost Boys"" with a few things switched around. The movie even incorporates lines from the first film, which may have been cool if the movie was good, but since it's not, it comes off as more of an insult.In the movie, there is a love scene between Reeser and Sutherland that is shot like the Michael/Star scene in the original with the same ""Lost Boys"" theme song playing. However, the love scene is emotionless. Any vampire could see it's just a bloodless imitation of the thirst-quenching original (sorry, I couldn't resist using some vampy adjectives there). Also, the film's vampire death lore is inconsistent. For example, sometimes when a vampire is killed, it turns to stone. Other times it explodes, turns to dust, vomits gallons of blood -- WTF? Edgar Frog, (played by Corey Feldman) addresses it with the same line from the first film: ""No two bloodsuckers go the same way. Some yell and scream, some go quietly, some explode, some implode, but all will try to take you with them"". That kind of explains it but no vampires turned to stone or dust in the first one. Since this is a sequel, shouldn't they have stuck to the original? ""Death by stereo"", anyone? I don't know it just seemed like an excuse to use some CGI.As for the acting -- the lead actor, Tad Hilgenbrink (who plays Chris Emerson) is horrible -- please don't act again, dude. PLEASE!!! This guy may look like Jason Patrick but he has zero acting skills. Autumn Reeser who plays Nicole Emerson is not much better and is pretty forgettable. Angus Sutherland, who plays the main vamp, Shane, falls really far from his family tree. He possesses none of the skills of his famous father, Donald, or his half-brother Kiefer. What's up with his accent? He's like half-surfer, half-Brit? Very strange. So acting-wise, this movie gets like an F+. That excludes, Corey Feldman, of course, the only ray of hope in the whole mess. Jamison Newlander (Alan Frog) was cut out of the entire film and Corey Haim (Sam Emerson) appears in a 20-30 second cameo in the end credits. Why would they cut Alan Frog out of the story? Jamison Newlander filmed several scenes for this movie and all were cut. Why? He could have been a great addition. In fact, they should have just scrapped the two leads and made the entire movie with Haim, Feldman, and Newlander. In fact, if you like ""Lost Boys"" (which I'm guessing you do since you're reading this), check out the four comic mini-series, ""Lost Boys: Reign Of The Frogs"". It tells the story of the original gang between the end of first film and the beginning of this one. It's far more enjoyable than ""The Tribe"".Out of everything in this disaster of a movie, I enjoyed Corey Feldman and the Haim cameo at the end. I also liked the alternate endings available on the DVD's special features. Other than that, this movie was a complete letdown and ruined what could have been a successful franchise theatrically or on home video.",1,"Boys Get Lost in ""The Tribe""",1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,3649,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'went', 'movie', 'VERY', 'open', 'mind', 'real', 'expectations', 'just', 'hoped', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'least', 'watchable', 'Well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'BARELY', 'movie', ""n't"", 'good', 'Period', 'poorly', 'executed', 'sequel', 'sequel', 'pacing', 'off', 'direction', 'amateurish', 'Grudge', 'Pulse', 'bad', 'MTV', 'video', 'movie', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'language', 'try', 'make', 'up', 'fact', 'out', 'film', 'flaws', 'even', 'much', 'more', 'original', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'extreme', 'gore', 'nudity', 'was', 'relying', 'other', 'things', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'acting', 'story', 'just', 'rehash', 'first', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'few', 'things', 'switched', 'around', 'movie', 'even', 'lines', 'first', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'off', 'more', 'insult.In', 'movie', 'love', 'scene', 'Reeser', 'Sutherland', 'shot', 'Michael/Star', 'scene', 'original', 'same', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'theme', 'song', 'playing', 'However', 'love', 'scene', 'emotionless', 'vampire', 'could', 'see', 'just', 'bloodless', 'imitation', 'thirst-quenching', 'original', 'sorry', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'using', 'vampy', 'adjectives', 'there', 'Also', 'film', 'vampire', 'death', 'lore', 'inconsistent', 'example', 'sometimes', 'when', 'vampire', 'killed', 'stone', 'Other', 'times', 'dust', 'vomits', 'gallons', 'blood', 'WTF', 'Edgar', 'Frog', 'played', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'same', 'line', 'first', 'film', 'two', 'bloodsuckers', 'go', 'same', 'way', 'yell', 'scream', 'go', 'quietly', 'explode', 'implode', 'will', 'try', 'take', 'kind', 'explains', 'vampires', 'turned', 'stone', 'dust', 'first', 'one', 'sequel', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'stuck', 'original', 'Death', 'stereo', 'anyone', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'seemed', 'excuse', 'use', 'CGI.As', 'acting', 'lead', 'actor', 'Tad', 'Hilgenbrink', 'who', 'Chris', 'Emerson', 'horrible', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'again', 'dude', 'PLEASE', 'guy', 'may', 'look', 'Jason', 'Patrick', 'zero', 'acting', 'skills', 'Autumn', 'Reeser', 'who', 'Nicole', 'Emerson', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'pretty', 'forgettable', 'Angus', 'Sutherland', 'who', 'main', 'vamp', 'Shane', 'really', 'far', 'family', 'tree', 'none', 'skills', 'famous', 'father', 'Donald', 'half-brother', 'Kiefer', 'What', 'up', 'accent', 'half-surfer', 'half-Brit', 'Very', 'strange', 'So', 'acting-wise', 'movie', 'F+', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'course', 'only', 'ray', 'hope', 'whole', 'mess', 'Jamison', 'Newlander', 'Alan', 'Frog', 'was', 'cut', 'entire', 'film', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'Sam', 'Emerson', '20-30', 'second', 'cameo', 'end', 'credits', 'Why', 'would', 'cut', 'Alan', 'Frog', 'story', 'Jamison', 'Newlander', 'filmed', 'several', 'scenes', 'movie', 'were', 'cut', 'Why', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'addition', 'fact', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'scrapped', 'two', 'leads', 'made', 'entire', 'movie', 'Haim', 'Feldman', 'Newlander', 'fact', 'like', 'Lost', 'Boys', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'do', ""'re"", 'reading', 'check', 'out', 'four', 'comic', 'mini-series', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Reign', 'Frogs', 'story', 'original', 'gang', 'end', 'first', 'film', 'beginning', 'one', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Tribe', '.Out', 'everything', 'disaster', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'Haim', 'cameo', 'end', 'also', 'liked', 'alternate', 'endings', 'available', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'Other', 'movie', 'was', 'complete', 'letdown', 'ruined', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'successful', 'franchise', 'theatrically', 'home', 'video']",N/A

I mean, you would think that with a better budget and better special effects, it should have been a decent film, or at least as good, if not better than the original.Ex-surfer with issues turned guardian (Chris) and his sister (Nicole) move to Luna Bay (renting from their aunt) where people ""mysteriously disappear"" all the time. Coincidence? Probably not! On top of that, Chris wants to protect his little sister from the sexy but slightly weird, ex-surfer, Shane (played by Angus Sutherland, Keifer's younger brother), who left the surfing circuit mysteriously.  Where has Shane been and what has he been up to? Soon, Chris begins to suspect that the strange occurrences in Luna Bay may be related to the mysterious Shane and his group of followers, who are all adrenalin junkie/video playing pranksters (they jokingly eviscerate each other). Anyway, the story is pretty predictable...boy meets girl; boy decides he wants girl for an eternity; boy (who is secretly a vampire) tricks girl into drinking his blood, thus partially turning her; brother of girl knows something strange is going on in this small town and has a dislike for the bad boy; brother feels a duty to protect sister and prevent her from becoming the undead by taking a life; boy decides to embrace (only partially) the dark side; vampire hunter schools boy on the basic vamp tricks and terminology; brother along with vampire hunter, Edgar Frog (whose voice goes with his name) attempt to locate the nest of the vamps; and finally a big showdown between bad boy vamp and brother where sister must decide whose side she is on.Why then, if the movie was so bad did I give it a star? (1) Because I really liked the remake of the theme song; (2) Angus Sutherland was ok and I do see potential; and (3) because I loved the original.",1,Doesn't even compare to the original!,1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,2409,"['had', 'high', 'hopes', 'film', 'clue', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'went', 'straight', 'DVD', 'remember', 'original', 'mean', 'actually', 'drove', 'Blockbuster', 'even', 'have', 'become', 'demand', 'junkie', 'Never', 'having', 'leave', 'house', 'clicking', 'buy', 'sitting', 'sofa', 'How', 'easy', 'can', 'renting', 'video', 'get', 'kept', 'seeing', 'advertisements', 'was', 'too', 'impatient', 'wait', 'Anyway', 'was', 'driving', 'thought', 'how', 'bad', 'could', 'be', 'Sutherland', 'Keifer', 'played', 'original', 'Jami', 'Gertz', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'opinion', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'II', 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'mean', 'would', 'think', 'better', 'budget', 'better', 'special', 'effects', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'film', 'least', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'original.Ex-surfer', 'issues', 'turned', 'guardian', 'Chris', 'sister', 'Nicole', 'move', 'Luna', 'Bay', 'renting', 'aunt', 'where', 'people', 'mysteriously', 'disappear', 'time', 'Coincidence', 'Probably', 'not', 'top', 'Chris', 'protect', 'little', 'sister', 'sexy', 'slightly', 'weird', 'ex-surfer', 'Shane', 'played', 'Angus', 'Sutherland', 'Keifer', 'younger', 'brother', 'who', 'left', 'surfing', 'circuit', 'mysteriously', 'Where', 'Shane', 'been', 'what', 'been', 'up', 'Soon', 'Chris', 'suspect', 'strange', 'occurrences', 'Luna', 'Bay', 'may', 'be', 'related', 'mysterious', 'Shane', 'group', 'followers', 'who', 'are', 'adrenalin', 'junkie/video', 'playing', 'pranksters', 'jokingly', 'eviscerate', 'other', 'Anyway', 'story', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'eternity', 'who', 'secretly', 'vampire', 'girl', 'drinking', 'blood', 'thus', 'partially', 'turning', 'brother', 'girl', 'knows', 'something', 'strange', 'going', 'small', 'town', 'dislike', 'bad', 'boy', 'feels', 'duty', 'protect', 'sister', 'prevent', 'becoming', 'undead', 'taking', 'life', 'embrace', 'only', 'partially', 'dark', 'side', 'hunter', 'schools', 'boy', 'basic', 'vamp', 'tricks', 'terminology', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'Edgar', 'Frog', 'voice', 'name', 'attempt', 'locate', 'nest', 'vamps', 'finally', 'big', 'showdown', 'bad', 'boy', 'vamp', 'brother', 'where', 'sister', 'must', 'decide', 'side', 'on.Why', 'then', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'did', 'give', 'star', '1', 'really', 'liked', 'remake', 'theme', 'song', '2', 'Angus', 'Sutherland', 'was', 'ok', 'do', 'see', 'potential', '3', 'loved', 'original']",N/A

The two main characters are Chris and Nicole Emerson, brother and sister,  and have the same last name as Michael and Sam in the first movie, and they say their parents were killed in a car crash, but they never mention who the parents are. One has to assume they are the children of Michael and Star. They arrive to live with a wacky aunt, who's character is a lame attempt to recapture the eccentric Grandfather in the first film. She is their aunt, but who is she related to? Is she Star's sister? Or is she a great aunt and related to Lucy (the mother in the first film?). And where is Lucy? Is she dead? What about the Grandfather? And what happened to Laddie, the young boy from the first film?The two main actors are awful, but not as awful as Angus Sutherland, the main vampire character Shane Powers.  He looks like a WalMart version of Tom Cruise's Lestat , with long blond hair and billowy shirts. He speaks like Keanu Reeves, sounding stoned the entire time. He is not intimidating at all. He completely lacks any kind of menace.And because he is a Sutherland, albeit the half brother of Kiefer, his performance has to be compared.  But he reminds me of Bill and Ted Become Vampires more than the evil that was David in the first film.The film is unintentionally funny at moments and overly gory, in an obvious attempt to out do the tame gore of the 1980s and also make up for the horrible script. The camera effects are lame, in an attempt to make you feel like you're on an acid trip that fails.And please in the name of all that is decent in this world someone STOP Corey Feldman from ever acting again. His reprisal of his role as Edgar Frog is the perhaps the worst performance of the decade.

""The Tribe"" is a bad B movie sequel which was made far too late to retain any of its star power but is still trying to ride off of its predecessor's name. It does appear that it worked a little though as I was compelled to see it even though I knew what I was going to get and I don't seem to be the only one.The Good: Its predecessor and I have to admit it was kind of cool to see Corey and Corey on screen again even if it was just for a second and in a terrible movie.The Bad: Pretty much all the things you expect. A terrible script with a ludicrous plot and ""Buffy Like"" special effects (Which were fine for Buffy but not for this). The action sequences all felt inserted and forced. The plot itself felt tumbled together and rushed and the character development is extremely weak. Feldman seemed to be trying to Play Edward Frog as saltier version of the character which was pretty funny even though it wasn't intended to be.Overall: Many will have to see this movie just because of what it is.

1166471,A1OZ3QDLWKOFRH,B001ANQY7O,Renie Campoli,"[18, 20]","When I first heard that they were making a sequel to the 1987 hit ""The Lost Boys,"" I was floored. Why would they do such a dumb thing? I wondered. Supposedly, a script for a sequel floated around Hollywood for years before it finally fell through, and after watching ""Lost Boys: The Tribe,"" I see why the legitimate Hollywood gave up on it.Forget the fact that there isn't one single original idea in the script. Forget that, even after 21 years, the special effects in the original film are far better than ""Tribe."" Forget that there is a lot more nudity, gore, and foul language in ""Tribe"" than there ever was in the original. Forget all of that. This film is just plain bad. It sucks, if you'll pardon the pun.If you have seen ""The Lost Boys,"" then you've pretty much seen a vastly superior version of ""Lost Boys: The Tribe."" In my opinion, a great horror movie must have several things...a really good script, characters you actually care about, superb actors to bring those characters to life, some humor, and decent special effects. ""The Lost Boys"" had all of that, and more, whereas ""Lost Boys: The Tribe,"" only wishes it had 1/10th of what its predecessor had.The story is the same...siblings move to a crappy little coastal town where the missing person population is staggering and jobs are hard to come by. This time, it's Chris & Nicole Emerson (any relation to Mike & Sam from the first film? Apparently, the writers were too lazy to come up with a different last name.) Their parents are dead (instead of divorced, as in the first film; Mike & Sam show up at Grandpa's house with mom,) so they are forced to rent a house owned by their aunt.They go to a party. Nicole (Autumn Reeser) catches the eye of obvious head vampire Shane (Angus Sutherland, who definitely does NOT have brother Kiefer's talent at all.) She drinks from a flask, which obviously has more than booze in it, and voila! She becomes a half-vampire, much to the shock and dismay of her brother, Chris (Tad Hilgenbrink.) Enter Corey Feldman as Edgar Frog, the only returning original cast member that has any decent screen time. He's still getting ideas from the comic books, slaying vampires, and is still a complete weirdo. Feldman is LONG past his prime here. What worked for him as a teenager definitely does not work in his mid-30s. His character, who makes it clear that he lost a loved one to the vamps a while ago, should be more darker, and have more of an edge. The childish, home-made gadgets should be left behind, but they're still in use. I would have liked to see Jamison Newlander reprise his role as Allen Frog, because that may have made the film slightly more tolerable, but instead, we only see him in the 2 alternate endings that are included on the DVD. Don't get me started on Corey Haim showing up as a vampire during the end credits. That made no sense at all, and the 2 alternate endings he's in (as a human) make no sense. It was nice to see them on screen together, but Haim is not the cute kid he once was, and Feldman just looks pissed that he's even there to begin with.As far as the other vampires go, they were all annoying, obnoxious adrenaline junkies (think ""Point Break"" meets ""The Lost Boys,"" & you'll get the idea.) They surf, skate, ride motorcycles, and take great joy in stabbing each other for fun. They videotape their kills, and go ""whoooooo hooooooo"" a lot. They are nowhere near as evil or menacing as the original 4 vamps from the first film (Kiefer Sutherland, Alex Winter, Brooke McCarter, & Billy Wirth.) Kiefer Sutherland, as nice a man as he may be, has the most evil, menacing face and voice that I've ever seen & heard on film, and he was absolutely perfect in the original. He really should give his brother, Angus, some serious acting lessons. Apparently, the filmmakers thought that casting a Sutherland boy would give the film an air of credibility, which, sad to say, it did not. Kiefer's David in the first film had an evil, menacing seductiveness about him, whereas Angus' Shane only has plain seductiveness, without any real evil or menace, and even the seductiveness isn't that convincing.The amount of gore, nudity, & unnecessary foul language in the film is substantial, as well as the serious lack of creativity (in one scene, dialogue from the first film is recited, word for word; it's Edgar talking about the various ways a vampire will ""buy it...it's never a pretty sight. Some yell & scream, some go quietly. Some explode, some implode. But all will try to take you with them."") I was flabbergasted. It's one thing to recite a famous line, like Bruce Willis does in the ""Die Hard"" films (""Yippee-ki-ay, motherf***er,) but to recite dialogue, verbatim, from an earlier film...it only goes to prove how hard ""Tribe"" tries to be like the original ""Lost Boys.""  They even went so far as to put the tag line from the original film in as dialogue. All I could do is shake my head in amazement. What little humor it has seems forced, as well.I must say, however, that I did chuckle a couple of times at some of the fresh one-liners. I already forgot what they were, but they were funny. And most important, they weren't ripped right out of the original film. I also like the remix of ""Cry Little Sister,"" Gerard McMann's theme to ""The Lost Boys."" The video for this remix is included on the DVD, although it's not on the official soundtrack to ""Tribe."" There is another cover of ""Cry Little Sister"" (done by another band) that is on the soundtrack, though; you can hear it when you're at the main menu.Also, I must say this about the Coreys. They are more than their past mistakes. If Hollywood were as forgiving back in the 80's as it is today, I feel they would still have very strong careers. They are both very talented actors; all one has to do is watch films like ""Stand By Me,"" ""Lucas,"" ""Silver Bullet,"" or ""The Goonies"" to see that. Hopefully, they will both realize that what worked for them when they were younger won't work for them today. They don't have to be a Hollywood joke or stuck in an A&E; reality show for the rest of their lives. Even though my teenage crush on both of them ended years ago, I still like them as actors. They just need better parts (and, apparently, better agents.)""The Lost Boys"" had a great story, a strong cast, characters I actually gave a crap about, just the right amount of humor, and great special effects for its time. ""Lost Boys: The Tribe"" tries in vain to be all of these things, but it only achieves one thing...being a truly disappointing and forgettable piece of trash that deservedly went straight to video. The magic that was ""The Lost Boys"" was left back in 1987, and even though this film tries in vain to recapture that magic with nearly identical characters, storylines, and a ""stunned-look"" ending, it only succeeds in gloriously failing to do so. Perhaps the makers knew all along that it would be a failure that never should have happened. Now, I must cleanse myself of the memories of this film. I'm going to watch ""The Lost Boys."" 100 viewings should do it.",1,Avoid This Movie Like The Plague!

1166472,AIJ0DEHA822CS,B001ANQY7O,"Ricky Pooski ""cool""","[3, 5]","Pleae note that the four star review is for anyone buying this DVD and expecting a mindless time waster. If you are expecting a great movie that you can give to your friends and get excited about, forget it. Buy the original cult hit. But if you are expecting a pleasant diversion that reminds you enough of the old movie to hit your nostalgia pleasure centers and moves along at an even clip, this is the movie for you.Of course, it's still got it's annoying dopiness. Corey Feldman is a truly terrible actor. But at least he's instantly recognizeable as Corey Feldman. I think he looks the same as the old days, but he's also been solidly in the C-List with Howard Stern appearances and those Surreal Life episodes (where somehow he beat out Hammer, Emmanuel Lewis, Vince Neal and the Survivor chicks in order to obtain the designation as ""the annoying one""). When Corey Haim shows up for his requisite cameo, he looks really different from his childhood version. I had to go to IMDB to find out who he was in order to get the joke. But really, Corey Feldman has one acting decision to make and that's to growl like Christian Bale in the Bat Suit. Oh and at one point he drops his voice when he has to mention a family member becoming a vampire.Thankfully the rest of the cast is a little better, but a lot of the scenes are tailor made to make you remember and appreciate the original. There's the death by antler scene, the sunglasses in the daytime bit, the ""here drink some vampire blood thinking it's wine"" scene and the mysterious woman at the party who learns the guy in. And of course, the main vampire is a very cool longhaired blond dude with facial stubble. He definitely doesn't have the smoldering intensity of Keiffer Sutherland. And for stunt casting and irony, the girl he's trying to seduce is played by Keiffer Sutherland's daughter. And she's actually pretty good.So all in all, some funny scenes. Some pretty good lines and no real horror. But how many horror movies are that scary?

Its not to say that the film is not watch-able, just that its not in the same league as the original LOST BOYS, and so its kind of sad to see the brilliant franchise brought back for some wanna-be BLADE vampire seconds. The big plus is Edgar Frog; Corey Feldman reprises his original role in a fairly neat way that really deserved an exposition scene as in ""how I got here from there"" sort of thing. We get plenty of character from Corey in his role, but the director seems so obsessed with showing that Vampires would be Extreme Sport fans with enough cash to use an expensive Hacienda as a play pen, but still stick to Edgars Vampire rules and sleep in a decaying hovel, that it kind of stretches the character element.There are the elements here that could have saved this film, but unfortunately someone forgot to ask for a re-write.Other than that is kind of fun, but if you are expecting LOST BOYS part 2, then do not.THE DVD: No Commentary at all.The ""Action Junkies"" feature is no biggie to the point of being, WHY?? Its a waste of time, and only a few minutes at that, since it explains very little. Edgar Frog's Guide to Surviving is great, and shows why Corey does such a cool job in the film. The alternate endings are a tad better than the one squeezed in at the finish, and look like it was the basis for a re-shoot ( i.e. someone at the studio decided that this was not going anywhere but direct to video).",3,"Fun, but its not the Same",1234569600,"02 14, 2009",2009,1824,"['first', 'glimpse', 'film', 'was', 'number', 'months', 'back', 'when', 'released', 'very', 'nice', 'package', 'So', 'saw', 'recently', 'terrible', 'package', 'decided', 'buy', 'anyway.The', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'LOST', 'BOYS', 'Tribe', 'basically', 'lead', 'done', 'more', 'lines', 'what', 'original', 'film', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'Tom', 'Savini', 'cameo', 'victim', 'Vampire', 'be', 'sequel', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'not', 'watch-able', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'original', 'LOST', 'BOYS', 'so', 'kind', 'sad', 'see', 'brilliant', 'franchise', 'brought', 'back', 'wanna-be', 'BLADE', 'vampire', 'seconds', 'big', 'plus', 'Edgar', 'Frog', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'original', 'role', 'fairly', 'neat', 'way', 'really', 'deserved', 'exposition', 'scene', 'how', 'got', 'here', 'there', 'sort', 'thing', 'get', 'plenty', 'character', 'Corey', 'role', 'director', 'so', 'obsessed', 'showing', 'Vampires', 'would', 'be', 'Extreme', 'Sport', 'fans', 'enough', 'cash', 'use', 'expensive', 'Hacienda', 'play', 'pen', 'still', 'stick', 'Edgars', 'Vampire', 'rules', 'sleep', 'decaying', 'hovel', 'kind', 'stretches', 'character', 'are', 'elements', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'someone', 'forgot', 'ask', 're-write.Other', 'kind', 'fun', 'are', 'expecting', 'LOST', 'BOYS', 'part', '2', 'then', 'do', 'DVD', 'Commentary', 'all.The', 'Action', 'Junkies', 'feature', 'biggie', 'point', 'being', 'WHY', 'waste', 'time', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'very', 'little', 'Edgar', 'Frog', 'Guide', 'Surviving', 'great', 'why', 'Corey', 'cool', 'job', 'film', 'alternate', 'endings', 'are', 'tad', 'better', 'one', 'squeezed', 'finish', 'look', 'was', 'basis', 're-shoot', 'i.e', 'someone', 'studio', 'decided', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'anywhere', 'direct', 'video']",N/A

I think the director/writer whoever was trying to make an updated Keifer and it didn't work with this guy. He looked tooooo much like a surfer guy and I just wasn't believing him. If they made him moreso a ""Twilight"" kinda guy and had him indifferent about vampires killing people then that might have worked but then again, that's not a leader type dude right? The effects were suprisingly good (minus the blood stuff)The other vampires were great.As far as the moviePros: Corey FELDMAN!!! Wow he doesn't age! He made the movie hot. If he wasn't in it this movie would have gotten an F- from me. The part about him being a minister, MADE SENSE!!! So Props to script for that and his weapons were cool, the bandana was cool.Nudity was a plus!!! Not dumb, kinda realistic and good right.The aunt was a plus. I cracked up at all of her scenes. That was a plus for the script.Cons: Unless my hearing is bad, the cast sometimes needed to redo their lines in the studio b/c i couldn't understand some of them. Was it just me? I turned on the subtitles.Script: wayyyy too many holes in the script. Like at the party when one of the vamps stabbed the other one, did the guests get that or were they all vampires (specifically the girl)Ummm the scene with them vs the cops? didn't get that.The weird kid that liked Lisa? Why say be safe and then go walking at night by yourself?? the lines should have been rewritten somewhere!!! I thought he knew there were vampires in town.The storyline with Lisa sometimes didn't work. She struggled then she didn't. Sometimes I was thinking wow re do the script. I liked her voice though very trademarky so I'm sure she'll get more roles!Vampire look- i know usually getting different directors you'll get different looks. I don't get though why there were several versions of Vampires in it. i know people were inspired by Buffy's makeup. So nothing new.Others from the original movie should have been in this film, like in the movie, none of that in the credits or alternate ending stuff. that was crap and  a letdown.Last con about the movie- the Frog extra feature. I pretty much got everything from watching the movie. If Corey had been Corey and talked about the weapons and maybe behind the scenes, I could have dugged that. If the comic books were real (which i doubt) I would have gone to go buy them, i know there'sa comic out so I'll go buy thatLike I said Corey Feldman made this movie decent. The promotion was great and I liked the music!!!! (i know some people didn't but i liked it) I got through the movie, I didn't turn it off early so that was a plus but I was expecting more.... I still say watch it/rent it but man this didn't come close to the original. And wasn't the best as far as remakes of stuff. (I think Texas Chains done the best so far)",3,Hmmmmm still rubbing my head.

1166484,A187O4M7CZMTDB,B001ANQY7O,T. Hunter-Selbrede,"[6, 7]","First of all, I'm whacking myself for not only buying this, but spending the extra bucks to get it on Blu-Ray, which my High Def TV proved to show Just How Bad this straight to DVD is.  I've never even seen a standard DVD show up as fuzzy as this alleged Blu-Ray did.On to the DVD, though discussing the sheer vileness of the Blu-Ray quality is much more entertaining than reviewing this movie.  I know it sounds like a bad pun, but it sucks.  It sucks bad.  It sucks big.  It sucks beyond human or vampire belief.  There was more of a plot in the occasional speculation about WHAT the plot of the movie would be than there actually was in the actual movie.For example, the orphaned Emerson siblings - how are they related to the original Emersons?  First I heard they were supposed to be Michael and Star's children, then I heard they were some random cousins.  Regardless, it is never, ever brought up in the movie.  They might as well be, and apparently are, people who coincidentally have the same last name as the original name.  Certainly Edgar Frog (Corey Feldman) has absolutely no recognition or acknowledgement of them being in any way related to the Emerson's he knew, even in a surprise scene hidden in the credits and a deleted scene available in the extras which show him interacting with the late, unlamented Corey Haim reprising Sam Emerson.And, yes, I know that Haim isn't dead.  I just can't help but notice in those two brief scenes not actually in the movie that there was all the plot you needed for a really interesting and decent movie.  Judging from the massive bad press revolving around Haim, his 'issues', and his self-declared war with Feldman - well, knowing that most of his stuff in the film was not filmed and the bit that was filmed was tossed; I can only blame Haim for the massive mess leftover and the massive mess certainly is why the movie didn't make it to the theatres.  In short, Haim's killed himself and his career for good this time, I'd say, and took down a bunch of other innocent people in the bargain.Moving along, the other massively unused potential plot-builder was the fact that the master vampire in this film is played by Keifer Sutherland's young half-brother.  Angus Sutherland's resemblance is close enough to have actually made use of that connection - his character of Shane could very well have been the brother of Keifer's David.  Unfortunately, like the Emerson connection was utterly ignored as a potential plot point, so was the use of the Sutherland brothers.There were a few blink and you missed it moments, such as the muscular, oily saxaphone player from the first movie now playing sax on the corner, in the daylight, still oiled, still pretty muscular, still long-haired, but with a beer gut like a Green Bay Packer fan.  Tom Savini, one of the masters of horror prosthetics and special effects (who is oddly showing up in a lot of movies for the sake of being dismembered, if Planet Terror is any indication), is a master vampire taken down by Shane and his crew in the beginning of the film.  When the Emerson's take a drive up to the Frog Brother's surfboard shaping shop, there is a sign that is briefly glimpsed which states essentially 'no one is invited in.'  If you don't get that reference, sorry, I'm not explaining it.The only occasional glimpses of fun is when Edgar Frog is on the scene.  He's mostly doing a re-run, but there are a few fun elements such as him becoming an ordained priest online so he can make his own holy water, which he does over many water balloons as part of his arsenal.  He only occasionally references the absent Frog brother, but the full story is in the deleted scene.Every other attempt to make this a worthwhile sequel is full of downfalls.  In the original you had the quirky grandfather who delivers the famous last line in the movie, ""The one thing I always hated about Santa Clara is all the damned vampires.""  In this movie you have an aunt whose quirkyness manifests in barefisted greed (she's charging her orphaned nephew and niece $600 a month for a hut) and total cluelessness (having won the battle against the vampires, the Emerson siblings, covered in blood and gore and drinking beers despite at least one of them being underage, have their front door slammed in as their aunt rails about knowing exactly what's going on and it had better stop or she'll turn them in - yes, that's essentially the last line in the movie, her accusing them of being potheads and stating ""zero tolerance!"").The extras are pathetic, no commentary to explain why this is so horrible, the deleted scene which shows what kind of movie it COULD have been (ironically with Haim at one point telling Feldman that he needs to grow up and take a realistic view on things), and about half a dozen music videos that really aren't worth watching.Now I have to go email some friends and hopefully warn them against buying this abomination.",1,Insult on top of injury...,1217980800,"08 6, 2008",2008,4933,"['First', ""'m"", 'whacking', 'not', 'only', 'buying', 'spending', 'extra', 'bucks', 'get', 'Blu-Ray', 'High', 'Def',

In fact, the final shot of the grandfather pulling a beer out of the refrigerator and complaining about all the vampires as if they were nuisance, slightly more onerous than roaches should have been the final word on California vampires and cool soundtracks.There is no reason to make it - artistically or commercially - but apparently Corey Feldman needed something to do and the reality shows weren't calling. So a lot of people spent a lot of money and worked very hard on making Corey Feldman feel like he was relevant again. They even threw in Kiefer Sutherland's daughter and a cameo by Cory Haim for good measure.So what do you get? You get a movie that is trying its hardest to remind you of the first movie. There's the blood drinking scene and the &#34;hey, let's hang out and be vampires&#34; scene and there is the moral dilemma of the protagonist becoming a vampire. In fact, the only thing that's left is Corey Haim's rather terrible acting which is actually fun. He is the veteran vampire hunter and he's trying to do his best hard boiled noir routine.

1166490,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B001ANQY7O,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[2, 4]","I have never written a review for a DVD before, but this one was so bad that I feel compelled to warn people about it. The only reason anyone should watch Lost Boys: The Tribe is as a lesson in film-making, to see all of the ways in which a sequel can be utterly ruined beyond any hope of salvage.It is an apt (though unintended) metaphor for the film that it begins with Tom Savini, the legendary make-up and special effects man for countless horror films who has a cameo here, getting his head cut off in the opening sequence, thus eliminating the only person who knows anything about how horror films should be made from the rest of the movie.Here is a list of everything that went wrong with this movie:(1) None of the talented people who were behind the original Lost Boys had anything to do with the writing, producing or directing of this wretched sequel. The writing for Tribe is so awful it's hard to believe anyone thought it should be made into a movie. Hans Rodionoff should hereafter be limited to writing menus for fast-food chains. Bad fast-food chains. The directing is so emotionless and disjointed that P.J. Pesce should never be let near a director's chair again unless it's as a gofer to bring the chair to someone who actually knows how to direct a film.(2) Everything that made the original Lost Boys work is missing from the sequel, most particularly originality and humor. Tribe has not even the tiniest spark of originality and is utterly devoid of the humor that made the original so much fun. The handful of jokes fall utterly flat. A good example of the difference is in the family members the main characters move in with. The original had Bernard Hughes as Grandpa, and he was genuinely funny and engaging in his role. The Tribe has an aunt who is never anything but annoying. Even Corey Feldman, who is genuinely gifted at being funny while playing the roles straight as he did in the original, is left struggling here with the banal dialogue the leaden script has saddled him with, half of which seems to be word-for-word repeats of his dialogue in the first movie.(3) They're all too old to be ""boys"". In the original Lost Boys, the main characters were meant to be teenagers and they looked it as the actors playing the parts were all between 15 and 21, except for the youngest one - ""Laddie"" - who was 10.  In The Tribe, the ""lost boys"" don't look the part at all because all of the actors are too old, the youngest being 26 and the oldest being 30!(4) Bad casting. Tad Hilgenbrink and Autumn Reeser, who play the two main characters, are a big part of why this film doesn't work. If nothing else, they deserve Razzies for Worst Brother-Sister Portrayal Of 2008. If there is an absolute minimum that an actor can put of themselves into a role, both Hilgenbrink and Reeser fall short of that minimum. There is never any chemistry between the two of them or between either of them and any of the other actors in the film. And most of the rest of the actors never rise above bland genericness.(5) Bad editing.  Most particularly with the fact that Edgar Frog (Corey Feldman) keeps making references to his brother Alan but Alan Frog (Jamison Newlander) does not make a single appearance in the movie! All of Newlander's scenes were in fact deleted from the final cut, so the repeated references to him stand out like so many sore thumbs. The only place he shows up is in the two alternate endings provided on the DVD, where he is only seen briefly, from behind, where it could have been anyone.(6) Corey Haim. Corey Haim is arguably the scariest thing about this movie, even though he, like Jamison Newlander, does not actually appear in the movie itself, only in a brief scene inserted in the ending credits and in the two alternate endings. What's scary is that he's almost unrecognizeable - like someone spent the last 20 years beating him with an ugly stick - and all of the talent and promise he showed as a young actor is completely gone. In his brief scenes, he acts and sounds like he showed up late, spent all of ten minutes prepping for his role, stumbled through it and then grabbed his check and ran.On the plus side, I would mention three of the actors:Corey Feldman deserves credit for being a professional and putting himself totally into his performance. He's almost the only actor in this movie who seems to actually be trying to make it work, but even he cannot overcome the bad writing and directing.  I've heard there is a Lost Boys 3 in the works in which he will again be appearing. I can only hope that this time around he'll have better luck. He deserves it.Angus Sutherland was a perfect choice for this movie. He has the talent and is both reminiscent of Kiefer Sutherland in appearance and manner but at the same time distinctly different. You can see enough of him in his scenes to realize how good he could have been. With a decent script and direction, he could have made a memorable vampire successor to the original's David. As it was, however, the leaden script and direction killed any chances he had of doing something with the role.Monica Delain is incredibly hot and can actually act as well. They could have done a lot more with her in this movie - she was the only decent vampire besides Angus Sutherland - but unfortunately she gets killed off fairly quickly in a completely predictable while at the same time no-I'm-not-buying-this way. Another victim of the bad writing and directing.Do not waste your money on this movie. If by chance someone gives you a copy for free and you can fast-foward through most of it, then just watch the few bits worth seeing and avoid the rest.",1,A definite contender for Worst Sequel Ever
