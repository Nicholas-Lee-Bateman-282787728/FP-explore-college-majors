1506315,A35X5JMZE3MPKY,B006070RQ4,"Astral ""Astral""","[4, 7]","My kids were really excited for this one, and it did look like a promising kid friendly Indiana Jones adventure flick starring the Buddies.  It was originally supposed to be released around Easter of 2011 but was shoved back almost a year.  Since my kids enjoyed it, I am glad they did release it, but it is by no means a good movie.The plot is trite and ridiculous.  Of course, having puppies searching for treasure in forgotten tombs is not going to be a logical movie, but some of the things that happened were just ridiculous.  The main kid's Grandpa trips over one of the most important clues in an oasis.  Apparently he had spent his life looking for this thing and it's just right there in this tiny oasis under a few inches of sand.  The traps in the actual tomb should have been interesting, but were not.  Anyone could have made it through with ease.  Of course the humans didn't know this at first, and come across one trap.  It would make sense for adventuring Grandpa to go first and risk himself, or one of the bad guy's lackeys but instead they encourage the young grandson to do it.  This was just ridiculous.  Even my daughters pointed out how mean they were for risking the grandson's life in this way.  Nothing happens to him, but still. As for the ending... I'm sure the museum they are trying to save is about to tank since it's main exhibit has fallen due to theft.  This was supposed to be a funny end note involving the monkey that narrates this tale, but makes the whole debacle feel rather flat.Technically it is also a disaster, with terrible CGI all around.  The animals mouth movements do not look natural, nor as good as in previous movies.  However the worst are the cat statues that come to life in the tombs.  They are not difficult to animate, being flat, relatively smooth statues (no crazy fur effects needed) but are done stiffly and poorly.  They look like CGI from a late 90s video game.  Just pathetic.Boring and trite without any of the humor of other movies in the series, it is no wonder Treasure Buddies ended up on a straight to DVD route.  As boring as this was, I'm still giving it three stars.  Why?  Because my kids enjoyed the movie, and have watched it multiple times since we bought it.  They like it... for the most part it is innocent ""fun"", and really if the kids enjoy it, that's all that matters.If you are considering this as your first leap into the world of the Buddies, ""Space Buddies"" or ""Snow Buddies"" are better movies to start out on.",3,This movie is a DOG and not in good way,1328400000,"02 5, 2012",2012,2499,"['kids', 'were', 'really', 'excited', 'one', 'did', 'look', 'promising', 'kid', 'friendly', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'adventure', 'flick', 'starring', 'Buddies', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'be', 'released', 'Easter', '2011', 'was', 'shoved', 'back', 'almost', 'year', 'kids', 'enjoyed', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'release', 'means', 'good', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'trite', 'ridiculous', 'course', 'having', 'puppies', 'searching', 'treasure', 'forgotten', 'tombs', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'logical', 'movie', 'things', 'happened', 'were', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'main', 'kid', 'Grandpa', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'clues', 'oasis', 'Apparently', 'had', 'spent', 'life', 'looking', 'thing', 'just', 'right', 'there', 'tiny', 'oasis', 'few', 'inches', 'sand', 'traps', 'actual', 'tomb', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'were', 'not', 'Anyone', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'ease', 'course', 'humans', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'come', 'one', 'trap', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'adventuring', 'Grandpa', 'go', 'first', 'risk', 'one', 'bad', 'guy', 'lackeys', 'instead', 'encourage', 'young', 'grandson', 'do', 'was', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'Even', 'daughters', 'pointed', 'out', 'how', 'mean', 'were', 'risking', 'grandson', 'life', 'way', 'Nothing', 'still', 'ending', ""'m"", 'sure', 'museum', 'are', 'trying', 'save', 'tank', 'main', 'exhibit', 'fallen', 'due', 'theft', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'end', 'note', 'involving', 'monkey', 'tale', 'whole', 'debacle', 'feel', 'rather', 'flat.Technically', 'also', 'disaster', 'terrible', 'CGI', 'around', 'animals', 'mouth', 'movements', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'natural', 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'movies', 'However', 'worst', 'are', 'cat', 'come', 'life', 'tombs', 'are', 'not', 'difficult', 'animate', 'being', 'flat', 'relatively', 'smooth', 'statues', 'crazy', 'fur', 'effects', 'needed', 'are', 'done', 'stiffly', 'poorly', 'look', 'CGI', 'late', '90s', 'video', 'game', 'Just', 'pathetic.Boring', 'trite', 'humor', 'other', 'movies', 'series', 'wonder', 'Treasure', 'Buddies', 'ended', 'up', 'straight', 'DVD', 'route', 'As', 'boring', 'was', ""'m"", 'still', 'giving', 'three', 'stars', 'Why', 'kids', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'have', 'watched', 'multiple', 'times', 'bought', 'most', 'part', 'innocent', 'fun', 'really', 'kids', 'enjoy', 'matters.If', 'are', 'considering', 'first', 'leap', 'world', 'Buddies', 'Space', 'Buddies', 'Snow', 'Buddies', 'are', 'better', 'movies', 'start', 'out']",N/A

I agree with everyone that the Buddies direct to dvd franchise is strained and borderline pathetic.  And I was ready to completely dislike the movie before even watching it.  But to my chagrin by the third time my six year old played the disc, I found myself chuckling at some of the lines and antics.Yes, the CGI is bad. The ""Middle Eastern accents"" are bad. The humor is bad and at times completely unnecessary (when Cammy and Butter Ball discuss regurgitation... YUCK! While a fact of life, was this important enough to put in the movie?!?!). And the premise of the movie?  ... you guessed it, bad.  For anyone put off by the supernatural storyline in Spooky Buddies, Treasure Buddies is no different as there is a curse involved and an evil cat bent on taking over the world (think Warner Brother's ""Cats & Dogs"" movies).  Yes there are scary scenes because of whole storyline, but the amount of 'fright' really depends on your child's age and maturity level.  There are also other mature themes like the sale of camels (ie: animal rights), and grave robbing.  On the flip side, there are definitely cultural aspects present such as prayer and specific Egyptian foods - and your child will probably have questions about all of this as mine did.  While the movie is G-rated, I'd say 5+ is a good range.What really helped redeem the movie was the acting.  Yes, I said acting!  Edward Hermann (recognizible from reruns of The Gilmore Girls and on voiceover work on various programs on the Biography Channel as well as a slew of movies) and Richard Riehle (a character actor who played Santa Claus in the 'Search for Santa Paws' - the buddy-less direct to dvd Buddy movie). These two obviously enjoyed hamming it up and getting into their over the top 'old man adventurer' roles.  Plus, they had more screen time than the Buddies! And I confess, I LOVE Uncle Babi!  I know, I know - a monkey for comic relief is as old as that black and white Laurel and Hardy mummy movie, but this monkey offered up some decent gags. Who knew another Disney monkey could take on Aladdin's Abu???The bonus features are basic: the ""Roam"" 'music video' (basically, karaoke for 2nd tier Disney Channel actors), B-Dog's episode of ""cribs"", and the ever present ""upgrade to blu-ray"" commercials.  To wrap up, my six year old would probably give this five stars.  So with my input, I'm settling with a solid 3.5 star rating.Did I mention I **LOVE** Uncle Babi?  ;)",4,When did Santa Claus become Indiana Jones????,1328400000,"02 5, 2012",2012,2495,"['fairness', 'am', 'torn', 'entire', 'review', 'agree', 'everyone', 'Buddies', 'direct', 'dvd', 'franchise', 'strained', 'borderline', 'pathetic', 'was', 'ready', 'completely', 'dislike', 'movie', 'even', 'watching', 'chagrin', 'third', 'time', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'played', 'disc', 'found', 'chuckling', 'lines', 'antics.Yes', 'CGI', 'bad', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'accents', 'are', 'bad', 'humor', 'bad', 'times', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'when', 'Cammy', 'Butter', 'Ball', 'regurgitation', 'YUCK', 'fact', 'life', 'was', 'important', 'enough', 'put', 'movie', 'premise', 'movie', 'guessed', 'bad', 'anyone', 'put', 'off', 'supernatural', 'storyline', 'Spooky', 'Buddies', 'Treasure', 'Buddies', 'different', 'curse', 'involved', 'evil', 'cat', 'bent', 'taking', 'over', 'world', 'think', 'Warner', 'Brother', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'movies', 'Yes', 'are', 'scary', 'scenes', 'whole', 'storyline', 'amount', ""'fright"", 'really', 'child', 'age', 'maturity', 'level', 'are', 'also', 'other', 'mature', 'themes', 'sale', 'camels', 'ie', 'animal', 'rights', 'grave', 'robbing', 'flip', 'side', 'are', 'definitely', 'cultural', 'aspects', 'present', 'such', 'prayer', 'specific', 'Egyptian', 'foods', 'child', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'questions', 'mine', 'did', 'movie', 'G-rated', ""'d"", 'say', '5+', 'good', 'range.What', 'really', 'helped', 'redeem', 'movie', 'was', 'acting', 'Yes', 'said', 'acting', 'Edward', 'Hermann', 'recognizible', 'reruns', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'voiceover', 'work', 'various', 'programs', 'Biography', 'Channel', 'as', 'well', 'slew', 'movies', 'Richard', 'Riehle', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Santa', 'Claus', ""'Search"", 'Santa', 'Paws', 'buddy-less', 'direct', 'dvd', 'Buddy', 'movie', 'two', 'obviously', 'hamming', 'getting', 'top', 'man', 'adventurer', 'roles', 'had', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Buddies', 'confess', 'LOVE', 'Uncle', 'Babi', 'know', 'know', 'monkey', 'comic', 'relief', 'as', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'mummy', 'movie', 'monkey', 'offered', 'up', 'decent', 'gags', 'Who', 'knew', 'Disney', 'monkey', 'could', 'take', 'Aladdin', 'Abu', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'basic', 'Roam', ""'music"", 'video', 'basically', 'karaoke', '2nd', 'tier', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'actors', 'B-Dog', 'episode', 'cribs', 'ever', 'present', 'upgrade', 'blu-ray', 'commercials', 'wrap', 'up', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'would', 'probably', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'So', 'input', ""'m"", 'settling', 'solid', '3.5', 'star', 'rating.Did', 'mention', '**LOVE**', 'Uncle', 'Babi']",N/A
