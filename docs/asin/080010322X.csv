Overall, the movie was heartfelt and at times you wanted to just scream at both Susan and Don as they went through a 'rough patch' in their marriage. The acting was good and it made you think alot about life in general. It made me want to sit my husband down to watch it (maybe one day). I wouldn't let kids watch this because it has foul language, but as an adult I did my best to ignore it. The writer's could of definately left out the foul language or used less intense foul language.

Although after a while, when Wiley (DJ's character) tries to patch things up with his wife (Susan Sarandon) she is awfully bitchy.  We all go through various stages in our relationships and some of us grow up while some of us grow apart.  This depicts how one couple starts to grow apart, but are finally able to grow back together.  Not too many people can come back from the brink like that.  This also depicts the confusion created for the kids when the parents are at odds.  Jeff and DJ are great as life long friends who depend on each other a lot.  They are each other's rocks.  It is good to have those people outside of a marriage to help you through anything.  Jeff Daniels mother in the movie makes a good point when she tells Sandy (Sarandon) that her husband was a difficult man to live with and just because they were together a long time doesn't always mean it is easy, it takes work and sacrifice.

It is a spot on slice of life movie about a couple who love each other, but don't understand why their lives are driving straight into the doldrums. They don't know how to communicate about it, and all they really need to succeed in their relationship is to do just that.There is a strong object lesson here that if watched and grasped, could save most marriages that fail for similar reasons. Watching the characters in this film is at times very frustrating. You know they could get it together if they could just slow down their headlong plunges in the wrong directions and find out, each, what the other is thinking. Yet this is the same situation many people find themselves in ... with spouses, children, parents, and sometimes estranged friends. It causes years to be lost, sometimes in very long stretches.This is not to say that the movie is without charm to entertain, it has plenty.

He decides to leave the house to find himself, we could say that what he finds out is that that life was the one that he longed for, but that's simplistic as hell.

160766,A5GIYITYJPWN1,080010322X,"L P ""lilip""","[0, 0]","Sweet Hearts Dance is a movie about someone going through a midlife crisis and the actions that ensue as a consequences of his misgivings and doubts and ultimate decision to leave his wife. An intriguing concept really, if executed properly. This movie, however, was executed quite poorly. The script was all over the place and not engaging and the characters were not multidimensional or very real. One moment Don Johnson is playing in the snow with his kids, the next moment everything is somber and he complains about his life and how the love and excitement are missing. You shift from rom-c0m to drama to rom-com -  back and forth. The issues, whatever struggles he might be feeling in his position, are not worked out at all and only superficially touched upon - to kind of like make the point, drop the hints for the audience and move on. There really wasnt much depth and deliberation in any of the character's actions. The result of which was an unbelievable cast, with unbelievable problems that the audience cannot identify with.The problem is further exacerbated by the interaction of the characters. His on-screen friendship with Jeff Daniels is supposed to be best-buddy type, but it was not very believable and kind of blah. I didnt see the ""tight good friends"" chemistry between the two. Don Johnson and Susan Sarandon also have zero chemistry, and throughout the movie they never engage in any meaningful and intelligent conversation and exchanges to make their love for one another believable. Johnson's character just complains he is unhappy but we dont know why, it is never fleshed out and presented.  When they do decide to get back together, it is sort of out of the blue and we also dont know why. Why did he change his mind, what is so different now than it was before. Surely the circumstances have not changed.  Did he realize he misses her and wants to be with her really? We dont know. This movie just did not show it and if i had not seen 30 other movies just like it, I would never have guessed.I also agree with another reader than Susan Sarandon was miscast here. She seemed more like she could be Johnson's mother rather than his wife. There is a scene half-way through the movie where Johnson looks out the balcony of their Caribbean resort and sees these women sunbathing in the nude and - with his wife in the room able to hear him - he tells his friend that this was the most beautiful body he has ever seen. How humiliating is that? To say that in front of the wife you just left? Of course the fact that Sarandon looks like she could play his mother didnt really make for a ""are you insane, you have a gorgeous wife there"" moment. I am sure this is not what the writers and director intended but the reaction of the audience to such a statement was more of a ""yeah, he is right"" than ""oh what a fool"".  That is because Sarandon is not gorgeous and it doesnt look like he was missing the point. In another scene he moons her and tells her to photograph that if she will. That kind of behavior does not score sympathy points for the character in the audience or make the whole ""I love you deeply, i am just going through stuff""  mantra believable. I personally thought it was supremely disrespectful. It is certainly not how you speak to your wife in front of your oldest son no less. This, in turn, contributed to making the character and the whole supposed big love story not very believable.It is good entertainment when you are bored and got nothing better to do, but this is not a quality movie. The script is to blame because i know these actors are all high caliber and quite capable of delivering a much better performance if given proper direction and something besides trite cliches to work with.",2,Entertaining But Low Quality Movie With Characters That Dont Have Much Chemistry Between Them,1311033600,"07 19, 2011",2011,3744,"['Sweet', 'Hearts', 'Dance', 'movie', 'someone', 'going', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'actions', 'ensue', 'consequences', 'misgivings', 'doubts', 'ultimate', 'decision', 'leave', 'wife', 'intriguing', 'concept', 'really', 'executed', 'properly', 'movie', 'however', 'was', 'executed', 'quite', 'poorly', 'script', 'was', 'place', 'not', 'engaging', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'multidimensional', 'very', 'real', 'One', 'moment', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'playing', 'snow', 'kids', 'next', 'moment', 'everything', 'somber', 'life', 'how', 'love', 'excitement', 'are', 'missing', 'shift', 'rom-c0m', 'drama', 'rom-com', 'back', 'forth', 'issues', 'might', 'be', 'feeling', 'position', 'are', 'not', 'worked', 'out', 'only', 'superficially', 'touched', 'kind', 'like', 'make', 'point', 'drop', 'hints', 'audience', 'move', 'really', 'wasnt', 'much', 'depth', 'deliberation', 'character', 'actions', 'result', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'cast', 'unbelievable', 'problems', 'audience', 'can', 'not', 'identify', 'with.The', 'problem', 'further', 'exacerbated', 'interaction', 'characters', 'on-screen', 'friendship', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'supposed', 'be', 'best-buddy', 'type', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'kind', 'blah', 'didnt', 'see', 'tight', 'good', 'friends', 'chemistry', 'two', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'also', 'have', 'zero', 'chemistry', 'movie', 'never', 'engage', 'meaningful', 'intelligent', 'conversation', 'exchanges', 'make', 'love', 'one', 'believable', 'Johnson', 'character', 'just', 'unhappy', 'dont', 'know', 'why', 'never', 'fleshed', 'out', 'presented', 'When', 'do', 'decide', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'sort', 'out', 'blue', 'also', 'dont', 'know', 'why', 'Why', 'did', 'change', 'mind', 'what', 'so', 'different', 'now', 'was', 'before', 'Surely', 'circumstances', 'have', 'not', 'changed', 'Did', 'realize', 'be', 'really', 'dont', 'know', 'movie', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'i', 'had', 'not', 'seen', '30', 'other', 'movies', 'just', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'guessed.I', 'also', 'agree', 'reader', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'was', 'miscast', 'here', 'seemed', 'more', 'could', 'be', 'Johnson', 'mother', 'rather', 'wife', 'scene', 'half-way', 'movie', 'where', 'Johnson', 'out', 'balcony', 'Caribbean', 'resort', 'women', 'sunbathing', 'nude', 'wife', 'room', 'able', 'hear', 'friend', 'was', 'most', 'beautiful', 'body', 'ever', 'seen', 'How', 'humiliating', 'say', 'front', 'wife', 'just', 'left', 'course', 'fact', 'Sarandon', 'could', 'play', 'mother', 'didnt', 'really', 'make', 'are', 'insane', 'have', 'gorgeous', 'wife', 'moment', 'am', 'sure', 'not', 'what', 'writers', 'director', 'intended', 'reaction', 'audience', 'statement', 'was', 'more', 'yeah', 'right', 'oh', 'what', 'fool', 'Sarandon', 'not', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'was', 'missing', 'point', 'scene', 'photograph', 'will', 'kind', 'behavior', 'not', 'score', 'sympathy', 'points', 'character', 'audience', 'make', 'whole', 'love', 'deeply', 'i', 'am', 'just', 'going', 'stuff', 'mantra', 'believable', 'personally', 'thought', 'was', 'supremely', 'disrespectful', 'certainly', 'not', 'how', 'speak', 'wife', 'front', 'oldest', 'son', 'less', 'turn', 'contributed', 'making', 'character', 'whole', 'supposed', 'big', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'very', 'believable.It', 'good', 'entertainment', 'when', 'are', 'bored', 'got', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'not', 'quality', 'movie', 'script', 'blame', 'i', 'know', 'actors', 'are', 'high', 'caliber', 'quite', 'capable', 'delivering', 'much', 'better', 'performance', 'given', 'proper', 'direction', 'something', 'trite', 'cliches', 'work']",N/A

I went alone, and I was lonely, because my wife and two sons were on a school trip or something.  Perhaps because of this, it has stayed in my memory all these eighteen years.  Sweethearts Dance was released the year before Field of Dreams, and in some ways it deserves similar status.  Field of Dreams is about how easiy life can go awry. Everything is resolved through magic.  Sweethearts Dance is about how easily the optimism of youth and the passion of marriage can be diluted by the routines of making a living, raising children, and managing a family.  Everything is resolved through the persistence of love.  Which one is more true to life?  The film contains some memorable scenes, such as the turning point when Susan Sarandon's and Don Johnson's characters admit that all they want is to love each other.  As Don, sitting in a tree outside the window of his own bedroom, tells his wife, ""How did things get so screwed up?  I miss you.  I miss our children,"" my eyes filled with tears.  Jeff Daniels, one of the best supporting actors in the business, loves Don and Susan both, and he has his own problems with love.  He has found the perfect woman, but he pushes too hard and nearly loses her.  The scene in which she calls him from home while he is on vacation to thank him for asking him to marry her also tugs at the heart.  Jeff is able to say, ""I like you,"" and it's enough to restore the relationship.  The ending of the movie is one of the most delightful ever filmed--you'll laugh and cry at the tenderness and ridiculousness of it.  Tender and ridiculous--kind of how love is sometimes.

160770,A2UYGOYMV73826,080010322X,Rushmore,"[0, 0]","I picked this movie up a while ago in a bargain bin, thinking it would have a Valentine theme.  Not so much.It's kind of a buddy movie, kind of about a marriage undergoing tremendous stress, and kind of a low budget period piece.  The best part for me was seeing Don Johnson, Susan Sarandon, Jeff Daniels and especially Elizabeth Perkins circa 1988.Elizabeth Perkins in particular is just lovely.  These days she plays the wisecracking big sister or sidekick, which she does very well.  This movie shows us that once she was an ingenue. She really lights up the screen in her scenes.  Having said that, it is Susan Sarandon's movie.  She is unquestionably the best actor of the bunch.  True, Don Johnson has the most screen time and is the central figure in the plot.  He rises well to the acting challenge, better than I would have expected for the guy from Miami Vice.  Jeff Daniels plays the lovable schlump we have seen from him in other roles.  He is fine.A couple of the younger actors are notable.  Justin Henry was the young boy in Kramer vs. Kramer.  This is the only other movie I have ever seen him in.  He is OK in this one.  He does have a moment with his dad, Don Johnson's character, that made me tear up a bit.  Holly Marie Combs plays the tween daughter of Wylie and Sandy.  She doesn't have much to do in this movie and has yet to show the stunning beauty she would become.I found the portrait of Wylie and Sandy's marriage to be quite compelling.  They are both miserable.  Each conversation between them is a dance (I think this is where the title comes from.)  One will reach out to the other, then snap back and shut the other one out.  Neither one is ready to give up on the marriage but neither wants to extend the olive branch more than half way.  The counterpoint is the growing relationship between the Jeff Daniels and Elizabeth Perkins characters, as well as the relationship of old high school buddies Wylie and Sam.I do have a problem with the ending of the movie.  The whole thing takes place between Halloween and sometime in winter.  Wylie is rebuilding the gym and plans to have it ready for the Valentine's Day dance.  The movie is structured in chapters - Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc.  So why it would end before Valentine's Day is beyond me.It is a pretty low budget affair but a really interesting look at these actors before they were famous.

SWEET HEARTS DANCE is a marvelous film, with one of the best seques EVER to its closing credits.
