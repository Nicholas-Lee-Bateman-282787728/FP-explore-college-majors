1519376,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B006T1TMJE,F. S. L'hoir,"[20, 20]","This Swedish production is an excellent series, thanks to Eva Rose and a strong supporting cast. Rose plays homicide detective, Maria Wern. I found her character different from many women detectives, in that she is portrayed as being both competent and in charge, without ever becoming strident. As attractive as she is caring, in respect to her two fatherless children, Maria is also entirely compatible with her colleagues and her chief (unusual in many current international thrillers).As detective stories go, ""Maria Wern"" is lifted above the average by its outstanding cast and its magnificent settings, which make the series a pleasure to watch (The story is set on the large Baltic Island of Gotland--East of Denmark and West of Estonia and Latvia). The principal actors are so engaging and convincing in their characterisations that they captured my attention throughout each episode (It is, perhaps, a good idea to take the stories at face value; as enjoyable as I found the last episode, which constituted a scenario that might be called 'Agatha Christie meets Nancy Drew' [Maria and her old school chums are marooned on a storm-swept island.], I decided that it was best to overlook some small holes in the narrative that I detected on second viewing. The setting, on the cliff-island of Stora Karls&ouml;, is so spectacular, and the adventure so exciting that I simply wanted more of it!The subtitles are presented clearly and in idiomatic English. I hope that this compelling and idiosyncratic series continues.The viewer, however, might want to wait for the price to drop before purchasing.",5,Nordic Intrigue!,1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,1604,"['Swedish', 'production', 'excellent', 'series', 'thanks', 'Eva', 'Rose', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Rose', 'homicide', 'detective', 'Maria', 'Wern', 'found', 'character', 'different', 'many', 'women', 'detectives', 'portrayed', 'being', 'competent', 'charge', 'ever', 'becoming', 'strident', 'As', 'attractive', 'caring', 'respect', 'two', 'fatherless', 'children', 'Maria', 'also', 'entirely', 'compatible', 'colleagues', 'chief', 'unusual', 'many', 'current', 'international', 'thrillers', '.As', 'detective', 'stories', 'go', 'Maria', 'Wern', 'lifted', 'average', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'magnificent', 'settings', 'make', 'series', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'story', 'set', 'large', 'Baltic', 'Island', 'Gotland', 'East', 'Denmark', 'West', 'Estonia', 'Latvia', 'principal', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'engaging', 'convincing', 'characterisations', 'captured', 'attention', 'episode', 'perhaps', 'good', 'idea', 'take', 'stories', 'face', 'value', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'found', 'last', 'episode', 'constituted', 'scenario', 'might', 'be', 'called', ""'Agatha"", 'Christie', 'meets', 'Nancy', 'Drew', '[', 'Maria', 'old', 'school', 'chums', 'are', 'marooned', 'storm-swept', 'island', ']', 'decided', 'was', 'best', 'overlook', 'small', 'holes', 'narrative', 'detected', 'second', 'viewing', 'setting', 'cliff-island', 'Stora', 'Karls', 'ouml', 'so', 'spectacular', 'adventure', 'so', 'exciting', 'simply', 'wanted', 'more', 'subtitles', 'are', 'presented', 'clearly', 'idiomatic', 'English', 'hope', 'compelling', 'idiosyncratic', 'series', 'continues.The', 'viewer', 'however', 'might', 'want', 'wait', 'price', 'drop', 'purchasing']",Maria Wern: Episodes 4-7

However Season two (2) of ""Maria Wern"",in addition,  contains superbly written, directed and acted police dramas with episodes that contain very  high drama mysteries and great detective work done in a very understated (no screaming) manner by Maria Wern played superbly by Eva Rose who balances being a single-mom with being a great police woman.

1519379,A29PLTX74EI6NN,B006T1TMJE,"Kai Roberts ""mysterymaven""","[4, 4]","Oh, I do enjoy this series!!  I was smitten with the first three episodes but the next installments are, in my opinion, even better.  We've now gotten past the introductory part of the story and are fully engaged with the characters (thanks to some fine acting and screen writing).  Though the mysteries are all different, revolving around the cases the Gotland police are investigating, each episode builds on the character development of the previous one. (It is a pet peeve of mine when series make each episode so self-contained that previously important characters suddenly disappear with no reference or explanation, or where important events in the characters' histories are not mentioned in subsequent episodes, etc.) Real life isn't so well-encapsulated and neither is this series.  Life's various parts and participants bump into and spill over each other.  And so do the characters and story lines of Maria Wern. Of course, it's a continuation of the story of Maria, a senior police detective in Gotland, Sweden. She's a recent widow, a doting mother, a good friend, and an excellent cop.  Eva Rose, who plays Maria, does a fine job creating a realistic portrayal of a woman doing her best, -- not always perfectly -- but she is always trying.  The second set of episodes takes the focus away just a bit from Maria and expands it to include more of her colleagues, who are an interesting and likable group of individuals.  Maria's best friend, Erica, (also the department's medical examiner), features more prominently in these later episodes, as does Maria's colleague, Ardvisson. He is the youngest cop on the team and upon his father's death discovers he was adopted. Thus, he enters upon an emotionally-fraught quest to contact his long-lost sister. Very specific mysteries wrap around Erica and Ardvisson as they provide a human backdrop for the cases the team is investigating.  I continue to appreciate the way the detectives are portrayed as a team of professionals. They are ordinary people, doing their best, and doing it with respect for the victims of the crimes as well as with support for each other.  It's a refreshing change of pace from the usual collection of dysfunctional adults that many series feature, ostensibly to create quirky characters ""of interest.""  Another bonus of the episodes is the cinematography -- there are some gorgeous vistas portrayed of Gotland, and they are woven into the dramas in such a way that the landscape seems a vital part of the overall production, truly influencing the mood.  I also love the theme music, which is so well attuned to the series. It's lovely, moody, and evocative -- a perfect choice. So, yes, all in all, this series is a winner.",5,This Series Has It All!,1348012800,"09 19, 2012",2012,2711,"['Oh', 'do', 'enjoy', 'series', 'was', 'smitten', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'next', 'installments', 'are', 'opinion', 'even', 'better', ""'ve"", 'now', 'gotten', 'introductory', 'part', 'story', 'are', 'fully', 'engaged', 'characters', 'thanks', 'fine', 'acting', 'screen', 'writing', 'mysteries', 'are', 'different', 'revolving', 'cases', 'Gotland', 'police', 'are', 'investigating', 'episode', 'character', 'development', 'previous', 'one', 'pet', 'peeve', 'mine', 'when', 'series', 'make', 'episode', 'so', 'self-contained', 'previously', 'important', 'characters', 'suddenly', 'disappear', 'reference', 'explanation', 'where', 'important', 'events', 'characters', 'histories', 'are', 'not', 'mentioned', 'subsequent', 'episodes', 'etc', 'Real', 'life', ""n't"", 'so', 'well-encapsulated', 'series', 'Life', 'various', 'parts', 'participants', 'bump', 'spill', 'other', 'so', 'do', 'characters', 'story', 'lines', 'Maria', 'Wern', 'course', 'continuation', 'story', 'Maria', 'senior', 'police', 'detective', 'Gotland', 'Sweden', 'recent', 'widow', 'doting', 'mother', 'good', 'friend', 'excellent', 'cop', 'Eva', 'Rose', 'who', 'Maria', 'fine', 'job', 'creating', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'doing', 'best', 'not', 'always', 'perfectly', 'always', 'trying', 'second', 'set', 'episodes', 'focus', 'away', 'just', 'bit', 'Maria', 'include', 'more', 'colleagues', 'who', 'are', 'interesting', 'likable', 'group', 'individuals', 'Maria', 'best', 'friend', 'Erica', 'also', 'department', 'medical', 'examiner', 'more', 'prominently', 'later', 'episodes', 'Maria', 'colleague', 'Ardvisson', 'youngest', 'cop', 'team', 'father', 'death', 'discovers', 'was', 'adopted', 'Thus', 'emotionally-fraught', 'quest', 'contact', 'long-lost', 'sister', 'Very', 'specific', 'mysteries', 'wrap', 'Erica', 'Ardvisson', 'provide', 'human', 'backdrop', 'cases', 'team', 'investigating', 'continue', 'appreciate', 'way', 'detectives', 'are', 'portrayed', 'team', 'professionals', 'are', 'ordinary', 'people', 'doing', 'best', 'doing', 'respect', 'victims', 'crimes', 'as', 'well', 'support', 'other', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace', 'usual', 'collection', 'dysfunctional', 'adults', 'many', 'series', 'feature', 'ostensibly', 'create', 'quirky', 'characters', 'interest', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'cinematography', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'vistas', 'portrayed', 'Gotland', 'are', 'woven', 'dramas', 'such', 'way', 'landscape', 'vital', 'part', 'overall', 'production', 'truly', 'influencing', 'mood', 'also', 'love', 'theme', 'music', 'so', 'well', 'attuned', 'series', 'lovely', 'moody', 'evocative', 'perfect', 'choice', 'So', 'yes', 'series', 'winner']",Maria Wern: Episodes 4-7

I enjoyed the last four episodes of Series One much more than the first Four.It could be that I have fallen under the spell of Maria Wern played by Eva Rose. Certainly she is an excellent actress, and is showing her true feelings when the murder and mayhem that follow her daily enters her family realm. I was particularly taken by the third episode where a boy, and then another goes missing. Maria sees her children in their place and takes the motherly instincts and roles as hers. In the final episode she and friends are followed by someone stalking her, and even though some of this episode seemed childish to me, it was also very realistic. The writing and directing are excellent and bring the books from which this series was taken to life. The other actors in this series become familiar like old acquaintances. I identify the characters from the book, and they too become true life characters.
