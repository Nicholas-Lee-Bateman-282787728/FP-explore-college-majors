It's one of the first Christmas DVDs we watch every year.I love that nearly all the original voice cast returns.  Danny Jacobs does a great job filling in for Sacha Baron in the role of King Julien.

Whenever I watch the Penguins of Madagascar on Nickelodeon, there's this weird feeling I happen to have. It's not that the show was bad. Heck, it's better than what's on Cartoon Network today, but it's just strange to see a Madagascar series run for so long without the movie series' cast: Alex the lion, Marty the zebra, Gloria the hippo, and Melman the giraffe. Fortunately, this is a return to form.Like anything you expect from Dreamworks, the comedy is as funny as the average movie they make, and the characters are memorable. Plus, the storyline is ridiculous. King Julian (lemur) fears a mysterious being that is attacking them with candy canes. Of course, it was Santa Claus. But he doesn't remember anything, since Alex threw a ground stake at him, not knowing who he was. Because of this, the cast we know and love has to deliver the presents.Their journey is just plain crazy, with silly situations, such as wondering how to get into the house unsuspected. Meanwhile, King Julian tries to show Santa how he celebrates Christmas (aka calls it Julianuary and has people bring him gifts). It's really fun watching what the characters do and what they say, as in any well-made CGI comedy.

Before the movie spawned two sequels and an animated series featuring those quick-thinking penguins, there was this Christmas special, MERRY MADAGASCAR.

Julian mistook the four friends and their balloon for the &#8220;red night goblin&#8221;; a mysterious being who appears every year on the 24th of Julianuary and showers the island full of coal. Shortly after, the &#8220;red night goblin&#8221; does appear and thanks to the prowess and aim of Alex, he&#8217;s shot out of the sky. As it turns out this &#8220;goblin&#8221; is really a giant elf named Santa. When he awakens he has amnesia and abandons his sleigh and reindeer. The reindeer are Russian and hate the penguins (who are from the South Pole). So, it&#8217;s left up to Alex and the gang to deliver all the presents left in the sleigh and save Christmas.I&#8217;ve seen a lot of modern animated Christmas specials and I have to say that although not original, MERRY MADAGASCAR is one of the better modern animated Christmas specials I have seen.
