I'm guessing that it's great for people who have been really active all their lives are are just getting a little inflexible due to age.  I'm closing in on 60 and found this too difficult, so was not faithful in pursuing it as a regular form of exercise.  I am unable to even partially perform many of the poses or stretches demostrated.  Besides age, I have the added disadvantage of hip and knee joint pain as a side effect from a drug that I'm taking, and have not found this to improve my joint condition.  I would like to see some unfit seniors working out with the instructor, just to see if it's really doable.",3,Not for me,1358121600,"01 14, 2013",2013,710,"['well-done', 'program', 'nice', 'visuals', 'easiy-to-follow', 'cues', 'instructor', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'great', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'active', 'lives', 'are', 'are', 'just', 'getting', 'little', 'inflexible', 'due', 'age', ""'m"", 'closing', '60', 'found', 'too', 'difficult', 'so', 'was', 'not', 'faithful', 'pursuing', 'regular', 'form', 'exercise', 'am', 'unable', 'even', 'partially', 'perform', 'many', 'poses', 'stretches', 'demostrated', 'Besides', 'age', 'have', 'added', 'disadvantage', 'hip', 'knee', 'joint', 'pain', 'side', 'effect', 'drug', ""'m"", 'taking', 'have', 'not', 'found', 'improve', 'joint', 'condition', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'unfit', 'seniors', 'working', 'out', 'instructor', 'just', 'see', 'really', 'doable']",N/A
936334,AF1H4YRBRMBB9,B000B5XPFQ,cat bounds,"[43, 45]","I bought this DVD because of the great reviews, and now as I reread them, I'm trying to figure out what they thought was so great about it. The instructor who demonstrates the Pilates is solemn and wooden, as is the woman  who does the voice over. ""Pilates Complete for Inflexible People"" doesn't seem to have one thing, specifically, to do with inflexibility.  I'm 61, active, and in great shape (size 6 jeans), but I'm getting some stiffness in my calves and thighs, as well as my shoulders, so I was really eager to get this one, but when I tried the very first set, I was already wondering what this had to do with specialized moves for inflexibility because they're some the very same moves I was doing at the fitness center where I exercised with people from 18 to 80, only much more repetitive, and full of incorrect transitions that could actually do harm if you follow them through.Always the optimist, I thought, ""Well, there's a lot more to this DVD than that little bit."" So, I began opening other segments, and they're all the same moves. I do know that there are hundreds of Pilate moves and positions, but this instructor seems to have gotten hold of 3 or 4 moves and made a career on them. They seemed more aimed at my stomach muscles than areas of inflexibility. I wanted a routine that would stretch and limber up my whole body,one that might be a little challenging in the beginning but that I could work up to, but that's not what I've got, and the whole setting with its dark, forboding background would have been depressing if I'd stuck with it much longer. There is nothing challenging, helpful, or inspiring about this DVD, and I would return it, but I got it here at Amazon.com when it was $9.99 w/ free shipping (I luv Amazon.com), and it would cost almost that much to return.Other exercise DVDs that I have and would recommend are ""Ageless Mobility""; ""The Anti-Aging Method""; and Louise Solomon's ""Yoga & Pilates"". I'll keep looking for more; I've decided I enjoy working out in the privacy of my own home, rather than going to the fitness center for classes, and I want a library of at least half a dozen DVDs to alternate.",1,"Wooden, unchallenging and uninspiring",1255305600,"10 12, 2009",2009,2152,"['bought', 'DVD', 'great', 'reviews', 'now', 'reread', ""'m"", 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'instructor', 'who', 'Pilates', 'solemn', 'wooden', 'woman', 'who', 'voice', 'Complete', 'Inflexible', 'People', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'specifically', 'do', 'inflexibility', ""'m"", '61', 'active', 'great', 'shape', 'size', '6', 'jeans', ""'m"", 'getting', 'stiffness', 'calves', 'thighs', 'as', 'well', 'shoulders', 'was', 'really', 'eager', 'get', 'one', 'when', 'tried', 'very', 'first', 'set', 'was', 'already', 'wondering', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'specialized', 'moves', 'inflexibility', ""'re"", 'very', 'same', 'moves', 'was', 'doing', 'fitness', 'center', 'where', 'exercised', 'people', '18', '80', 'only', 'much', 'more', 'repetitive', 'full', 'incorrect', 'transitions', 'could', 'actually', 'do', 'harm', 'follow', 'optimist', 'thought', 'Well', 'lot', 'more', 'DVD', 'little', 'bit', 'began', 'opening', 'other', 'segments', ""'re"", 'same', 'moves', 'do', 'know', 'are', 'hundreds', 'Pilate', 'moves', 'positions', 'instructor', 'have', 'gotten', 'hold', '3', '4', 'moves', 'made', 'career', 'seemed', 'more', 'aimed', 'stomach', 'muscles', 'areas', 'inflexibility', 'wanted', 'routine', 'would', 'stretch', 'limber', 'up', 'whole', 'body', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'challenging', 'beginning', 'could', 'work', 'up', 'not', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'whole', 'setting', 'dark', 'forboding', 'background', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'depressing', ""'d"", 'stuck', 'much', 'longer', 'nothing', 'challenging', 'helpful', 'inspiring', 'DVD', 'would', 'return', 'got', 'here', 'Amazon.com', 'when', 'was', '9.99', 'w/', 'free', 'shipping', 'luv', 'Amazon.com', 'would', 'cost', 'almost', 'that', 'much', 'return.Other', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'have', 'would', 'recommend', 'are', 'Ageless', 'Mobility', 'Anti-Aging', 'Method', 'Louise', 'Solomon', 'Yoga', 'Pilates', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'looking', 'more', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'enjoy', 'working', 'out', 'privacy', 'own', 'home', 'rather', 'going', 'fitness', 'center', 'classes', 'want', 'library', 'least', 'dozen', 'DVDs', 'alternate']",N/A

It is excellent.The DVD is interactive, which means you can choose what you want to do depending on how much time you have - 20 minutes, 30 minutes or an hour.  Maggie Rhodes has put together different sequences of exercises and modifies them enough that even us older folks can tackle most of them. In addition, you get Pilates and Yoga at the same time.Most Yoga and Pilates tapes are geared towards the 20 somethings and most of the ones that I have purchased either end up at my daughter's house or in the trash.  This is not to say that they are bad but I am just not as limber as I used to be.
