1431648,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B004X9YOOW,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 4]","The playwright, novelist turned filmmaker Marcel Pagnol will be remembered for his 1930&#8242;s romantic films such as ""The Fanny Trilogy"" (which consists of ""Marius"", ""Fanny"" and ""Cesar"").An award-winning French filmmaker who worked on more than a dozen films, for many who grew up with his work, his work captured France in the early 20th Century.  By 1940, Pagnol would go on to direct ""La fille du Puisatier"" (""The Well-Diggers Daughter""), a film that would would later catch the interest of actor Daniel Auteuil (""36th Precinct"", ""Cache"", ""Un Coeur en Hiver"", ""The Valet"").  An actor who also was once directed by Marcel Pagnol long ago for films such as ""Jean de Florette"" and ""Manon of the Spring"".So much that it would lead to Auteuil to write, direct and star in the 2011 remake of the film (Auteuil is currently working on the remake of ""The Fanny Trilogy""). In collaboration with cinematographer Jean-Francois Robin (""Nelly & Monsieur Arnaud"", ""Betty Blue"", ""Chaos"") and composer Alexandre Desplat (""The King's Speech"", ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1&#8243;), the film was well-received by film critics.For those who have been waiting for a home video release of this film, ""The Well-Digger's Daughter"" was released in the U.S. in Dec. 2012 courtesy of Kino Lorber on Blu-ray and DVD.VIDEO:""The Well-Digger's Daughter"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio).  The first thing you will notice is how beautiful the scenic shots are.  Jean-Francois Robin takes a page from Marcel Pagnol's writings of the countryside and capturing the beauty of the area, the flowers and the look of old France.  The film showcases many colors during the outdoors, while the indoors looks amazing because of the amount of detail that can be seen.Shot in 35 mm, picture quality is incredibly well-detailed.  You can see the textures of the clothing, skin details, the film looks magnificent in HD.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Well-Digger's Daughter"" is presented in French DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The film is dialogue-driven but the surround channels provide a good amount of ambiance for its countryside environment.  You will hear the birds, during the air show, you can hear crowds.  But what sticks out the most is the music.  Alexandre Desplat's music is absolutely beautiful and moving.The film is presented with English subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Well-Digger's Daughter"" comes with trailers and 16 stills from the film.JUDGMENT CALL:I absolutely love Marcel Pagnol films.  Its his way of covering romance and family, that is a style that makes me enamored with Yasujiro Ozu's work.  They have a unique style of capturing an era of their country that is of the past but relationships that are tied into family tradition and honor.Sure, ""The Well-Digger's Daughter"" can seem banal on paper, daughter gets pregnant, must tell parents and must raise child on their own.  We've watched films like this, we've seen dramas about this.But what makes this film so enchanting is how it centers around an old traditional family and how Pascal tries to keep his family's honor by having the man's family acknowledge her pregnancy and the baby.  But to see how this loving father get dejected, lose his honor and essentially is forced to cut ties with his own daughter.We also get to see the distinction of class differences, as Pascal is seen as a well-digger, Mme. Mazel is a woman who does not want her son mixing with poor women, and to why she burned the letter mean for Patricia, was it because she looked poor?  Possibly.But it's that display of one's guilt of getting pregnant before marriage and the inconvenience that was tied into the old traditions.  Which may be hard for one to fathom in today's world, of many single parents and where family honor especially in the family name, in most modern cultures, are a thing of the past.The performances of the film are also quite notable.  French actor Daniel Auteuil has starred in many films, but his role as Pascal, he manages to portray the aged, hardworking father with efficacy.  Also, you have another talented actor in Jean-Pierre Darroussin as Jacques' father and also actress Sabine Azema (partner of filmmaker Alain Resnais), playing Jacques domineering mother.  The film features solid performances by these veteran talents and definitely makes this remake quite enjoyable.While the film takes place during wartime and showcases an enjoyable romance melodrama, you can't help but watch these films and yearn for the days of old.  The storytelling of Marcel Pagnol that is able to fit in the complexities of old traditional values but also make it appealing and enjoyable for today's audiences.  While I have not seen the original ""La Fille du puisatier"" (as only a few Pagnol films have been released in America), for this remake, I absolutely enjoyed it.Wonderful acting, enjoyable storytelling and beautiful cinematography... What a wonderful remake from Daniel Auteuil and a homage to Marcel Pagnol's work!  ""The Well-Digger's Daughter"" is  recommended!",4,"Wonderful acting, enjoyable storytelling and beautiful cinematography...

I had to rewatch the two seduction films a couple of times as it wasn't clear or implicit if she had lost her virginity. A girl that young and naive could have been just as shaken by heavy petting and holding out against it to be good. The rest of the film could have been filled out more. Yet it became a stream of ideas, if not an explanation,  on love and death , the impact of war and the dynamics of family and new borns.Daniel Auteil was great in it as the patriarch. He was such a simple straight forward guy that he brought tongue in cheek on the fananglings of the others,which was amusing to sense.  Yes his daughter could have had more personality but as she  stood for a an undeveloped woman it did not matter.Spoiler coming...I was holding my breath it would turn into a trajedy. It was a relief it didn't. I am almost going off films because too many exult in bad decisions and sufferings , let alone people getting shot like popcorn.This film had a maths that added up to a positive without seeming to contrive a good ending,which was satisying.

1431653,A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4,B004X9YOOW,Gerard D. Launay,"[3, 5]","Marcel Pagnol made LA FILLE DU PUISATIER in 1940 - and it is a minor masterpiece.  Oh, what terrific actors - Raimu as Pascale  (the well digger) and Fernandel as Felipe (his good friend) whom he hopes will marry  Josette Day (his beautiful 18 year old daughter). In my eyes, it captures the rough texture of peasant life in the South of France.  And Fernandel does a marvelous job of communicating his effervescent humor. The New York Times included it as one of the top 1000 movies ever made.Daniel Auteil decided to remake the movie.  It looks better...it sounds better...but in my mind it lacks soul.  The daughterPatricia - played by Astric Berges-Frisbey - is so lovely and ethereal, she does not seem borne of the earth.  Even though she is returning from Paris, it seems impossible to think of her as a peasant.Of course, Auteil is excellent in the role of the dishonored father who discovers his daughter is impregnated by the son of a wealthier family that rejects her.  Provence is absolutely breathtaking in the film (that's the best part), and the opera music of Enrico Caruso is handled capably.Alas, the movie did not move my heart or engage my brain.

Auteuil plays a well digger whose daughter falls in love with the local merchant's son just before World War I.  This son is a pilot who has to go to war.  When the daughter lets people know that she's pregnant, her lover's parents refuse to recognize her, thus shaming the well digger's family.

1431670,A3AAMRYV2RLUIV,B004X9YOOW,William Shriver,"[4, 4]","When it comes to screen adaptations, if ever there was a fool-proof author it is Marcel Pagnol. First, there was theFanny Trilogy(1931-36); then several versions of TOPAZE (all good, but my fave is the Barrymore); then, many iterations of JEAN DE FLORETTE, MANON DES SOURCES, MY FATHERS GLORY & MY MOTHER'S CASTLE until definitive versions appeared asJean De Florette / Manon of the Spring (Double Feature),My Father's Glory&My Mother's Castle. 2011 brought this gem, directed by Auteuil, who will follow it up with another (I suspect sublime) version of the Fanny Trilogy in 2013. Full of visuals and sound, there is something fundamentally cinematic about Pagnol's prose: given that Pagnol directed 18 film versions of his own writings, I think it is fair to use the words ""reader"" and ""viewer"" interchangeably. ""His"" films, including this one, put the viewer in an Ozu-like state of restfulness while simultaneously offering up the challenges of the moral nuances of the story. In fact, with the exception of Ozu, I can't think of another cin&eacute;aste who has put me so at rest only to unveil the combating emotions of joy and pain that accompany every aspect of life.The transfer to Blu-Ray is impeccable. If you have ever visited the Provence region of France, you will find the ""found lighting"" of the exteriors very realistic--after all, this is where the Impressionists went to paint! (Much of the film was shot in St. R&eacute;my de Provence, where Van Gogh painted some of his most celebrated canvasses. The opening shot announces where we are, with its field of yellow flowers.) The cast is perfection. The sound mix is gorgeous: the noise of the natural environment supports the drama in equal portion as the score by Alexandre Desplat and the tidbits of source music by Billie Holliday and Caruso. The ending is absolutely Shakespearean, if by ""Shakespearean"" we mean his comedies.What is left to say? Watch this. Read Pagnol.

This sentence summarizes this movie. The pure mentality of the French villager ""&agrave; la campagne"". He prefers his own wine, (they make and cork their own wine from their own vineyards). He doesn't want to buy somebody else's wine. He doesn't want to be like ""les Parisiens"". He has contempt for the Parisians. He doesn't want to be part of the city ""elite"". He wants to live peacefully in the countryside with his family, his rules, and his routine. ""Vous savez les impts moi, on en a marre...""The movie is about Pascal (Daniel Auteil, a well-digger) father of six daughters living the hard life in the countryside in France, at the start of World War I. He always wanted a son, and he tried and tried, but he got six daughters. His wife died after the last daughter was born. He sent the oldest daughter Patricia (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) to live in Paris when she was young, but after his wife died he called her back to help him raise the other five daughters. She is well educated and he wants her to get married with his friend/assistant Felipe (Kad Merad), a nice simple man but much older than her. Of course she doesn't like him and is falling for Jacques (Nicolas Duvauchelle), a wealthy young pilot just in town for few days, whose parents are rich and own the big grocery store in town. She is impregnated by him just before he is called back into duty. What is going to happen next? Is he going to come back from the war? Is she going to tell her dad about the situation? Are they going to keep the baby? How the villagers and Jacques' parents going to react to these events? Those are some of the questions coming to mind. You will definitely get surprised by the answers and the plot of the movie. It is not what you expect. Hence, Marcel Pagnol's genius...He understands the human mind better than anybody else!This is another great adaptation of the work of Marcel Pagnol by Daniel Auteil, but this time he is also the director. Twenty five years later Daniel Auteil went back to the source that made him famous. Who forgot Ugolin playing alongside Yves Montand (C&eacute;sar) in ""Jean de Florette/Manon de source""? Daniel Auteil has the exact same accent, the same movements and same interaction with the camera, just few extra pounds. After I watched this movie I had to watch ""Manon de source"" again!This is a fabulous film and Daniel Auteuil takes over with his very poignant acting. He delivers some of the most powerful performance I have ever seen by an actor in several scenes. If you really liked ""Jean de Florette/Manon de source"" you will definitely appreciate this movie. Is not as intense as the other two movies, has a different plot, but really describes the mentality of the villagers in the countryside in France that is slowly disappearing these days because the people are disappearing. If you want to see and feel the French countryside mentality during the 1900's, then watch the movie!Five stars all around for everything but mostly for the powerful performances of all actors which are remarkable.",5,Moi je n'aime pas le vin bouch&eacute;!,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,3182,"['do', ""n't"", 'like', 'corked', 'wine', 'Pascal', 'said', 'movie', 'losely', 'translated', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'fancy', 'wine', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'sentence', 'movie', 'pure', 'mentality', 'French', 'villager', 'agrave', 'la', 'campagne', 'own', 'wine', 'make', 'cork', 'own', 'wine', 'own', 'vineyards', ""n't"", 'want', 'buy', 'somebody', 'else', 'wine', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'les', 'Parisiens', 'contempt', 'Parisians', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'part', 'city', 'elite', 'live', 'peacefully', 'countryside', 'family', 'rules', 'routine', 'Vous', 'savez', 'impts', 'moi', 'marre', 'movie', 'about', 'Pascal', 'Daniel', 'Auteil', 'well-digger', 'father', 'six', 'daughters', 'living', 'hard', 'life', 'countryside', 'France', 'start', 'World', 'War', 'always', 'wanted', 'son', 'tried', 'tried', 'got', 'six', 'daughters', 'wife', 'died', 'last', 'daughter', 'was', 'born', 'sent', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Patricia', 'Astrid', 'Berges-Frisbey', 'live', 'Paris', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'wife', 'died', 'called', 'back', 'help', 'raise', 'other', 'five', 'daughters', 'well', 'educated', 'get', 'married', 'friend/assistant', 'Felipe', 'Kad', 'Merad', 'nice', 'simple', 'man', 'much', 'older', 'course', ""n't"", 'like', 'falling', 'Jacques', 'Nicolas', 'Duvauchelle', 'wealthy', 'young', 'pilot', 'just', 'town', 'few', 'days', 'parents', 'are', 'rich', 'own', 'big', 'grocery', 'store', 'town', 'impregnated', 'just', 'called', 'back', 'duty', 'What', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'going', 'come', 'back', 'war', 'going', 'tell', 'dad', 'situation', 'Are', 'going', 'keep', 'baby', 'How', 'villagers', 'Jacques', 'parents', 'going', 'react', 'events', 'are', 'questions', 'coming', 'mind', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'surprised', 'answers', 'plot', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'expect', 'Hence', 'Marcel', 'Pagnol', 'genius', 'human', 'mind', 'better', 'anybody', 'else', 'great', 'adaptation', 'work', 'Marcel', 'Pagnol', 'Daniel', 'Auteil', 'time', 'also', 'director', 'Twenty', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'Daniel', 'Auteil', 'went', 'back', 'source', 'made', 'famous', 'Who', 'forgot', 'Ugolin', 'playing', 'alongside', 'Yves', 'Montand', 'C', 'eacute', 'sar', 'Jean', 'de', 'Florette/Manon', 'de', 'source', 'Daniel', 'Auteil', 'exact', 'same', 'accent', 'same', 'movements', 'same', 'interaction', 'camera', 'just', 'few', 'extra', 'pounds', 'watched', 'movie', 'had', 'watch', 'Manon', 'de', 'source', 'again', 'fabulous', 'film', 'Daniel', 'Auteuil', 'over', 'very', 'poignant', 'acting', 'most', 'powerful', 'performance', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'actor', 'several', 'scenes', 'really', 'liked', 'Jean', 'de', 'Florette/Manon', 'de', 'source', 'will', 'definitely', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'intense', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'different', 'plot', 'really', 'mentality', 'villagers', 'countryside', 'France', 'slowly', 'disappearing', 'days', 'people', 'are', 'disappearing', 'want', 'see', 'feel', 'French', 'countryside', 'mentality', '1900', 'then', 'watch', 'movie', 'Five', 'stars', 'everything', 'mostly', 'powerful', 'performances', 'actors', 'are', 'remarkable']",N/A
