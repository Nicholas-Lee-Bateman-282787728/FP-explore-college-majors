After I popped it in the player, it was like a different movie with all the vulgarity, and some lines/scenes I don't remember making it to tv...that I just couldn't take them swearing and using the LORD's name in vain over and over.  I was so disgusted I took it out and threw it away, so I have no idea how the other 2 movies were....Wish I could order edited DVDs....Such a shame.",1,Too much filthy language....review for Roommates only...,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,511,"['When', 'saw', 'Roommates', 'tv', 'long', 'time', 'loved', 'Well', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'see', 'DVD', 'so', 'economical', 'ordered', 'popped', 'player', 'was', 'different', 'movie', 'vulgarity', 'lines/scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'making', 'tv', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'swearing', 'using', 'LORD', 'name', 'vain', 'was', 'so', 'disgusted', 'took', 'out', 'threw', 'away', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'other', '2', 'movies', 'were', '.Wish', 'could', 'order', 'edited', 'DVDs', 'shame']",N/A
