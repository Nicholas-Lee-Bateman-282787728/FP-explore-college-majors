Meyer ""Tunefan""","[18, 18]","I received this dvd as a gift, and am writing this review as a fan who is always looking for opportunities to expose the uninitiated to great music, and a performer who excels in every respect. Glens incredible talent kept him in demand as a session musician for everyone from Sinatra to the Beach Boys. His own records are some the best ever recorded.Glen's ability to parlay country balladry with pop sensibility is unrivaled, and this live performance allows him to shine and show why so many people revere him. The excellent South Dakota Symphony join Campbell and play  the gorgeous string and horn arrangements integral to his music....what an orchestra! The camera work and resolution are exceptional.This concert resonates, illuminates, and leaves you wanting more. A stunning, entertaining, soothing and unforgettable evening awaits you.

I was a pre-teen in the 1970's when Glen Campbell was probably the most popular and I remember the songs on this DVD with a great deal of nostalgia.This live performance with the South Dakota Symphony has all the fan favorites from the ever popular Rhinestone Cowboy, Highway Man, Wichita Lineman, Galveston, Gentle on My Mind, Southern Nights, and others.  Even at nearly 70 now, Campbell puts on a great show.

I love good guitar playing, whether it is the classical guitar of Julian Bream, the jazz guitar of George Benson, or the first rate playing of Glen Campbell.  This concert has so much to offer.First, the South Dakota Symphony Orchestra is very good.  An orchestra really rounds out the kind of songs that Mr. Campbell performs.  I love the string section of an orchestra.  They add such beauty to his performance of ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix.""  That performance is truly beautiful!He performs the ""William Tell Overture.""  He tells of being a little boy and seeing The Lone Ranger in a movie theatre in Arkansas. He said that Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels were his first Western movie heroes.  As he  says, ""They were really something.""  While I am significantly younger than Mr. Campbell, I totally agree with him.  I loved The Lone Ranger as a little boy.  To this day I love the ""William Tell Overture.""  It is definitely one of my favorite musical compositions.  I can't listen to it and not smile.  He plays it on the guitar with the orchestra.  It is wonderful!He performs many of his popular songs: ""Wichita Lineman,"" ""Gentle on My Mind,"" ""Rhinestone Cowboy,"" and ""Galveston.""If you like Glen Campbell, then this concert is a must.  It is wonderful, and I expect to watch it over and over again.

I grew up with music from the 70's onwards and like a lot of styles of music including mostly rock music, but Glen Campbell has always commanded my attention. Glen may have aged somewhat by the time this concert was recorded, but fortunately his voice has remained intact long enough to be recorded by modern equipment and the end result is a fantastic concert both visually and audibly. This concert is beautifully performed and recorded and a lot of modern productions could learn a great deal from this performance on how to record a concert well.The orchestra is a wonderful accompanyment to Glen and the sound is rich and full. Glen's voice is pitch perfect and he does more than admirable performances of all material featured. I particularly like the songs ""Gentle On My Mind"" and "" Galveston"" - the latter ends with a fantastic guitar solo that has had me playing that song endlessly and everytime it gives me goosebumps !!Buy it and enjoy it - I could still buy it in New Zealand new from a local store ($25 NZ), it is disappointing to see it has been discontinued by the manufacturer and not easily obtainable in the USA.",5,An Unforgetable DVD Concert,1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,1234,"['bought', 'DVD', 'based', 'huge', 'number', 'five', 'star', 'reviews', 'website', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'grew', 'up', 'music', '70', 'onwards', 'lot', 'styles', 'music', 'including', 'mostly', 'rock', 'music', 'Glen', 'Campbell', 'always', 'commanded', 'attention', 'Glen', 'may', 'have', 'aged', 'somewhat', 'time', 'concert', 'was', 'recorded', 'fortunately', 'voice', 'remained', 'intact', 'long', 'enough', 'be', 'recorded', 'modern', 'equipment', 'end', 'result', 'fantastic', 'concert', 'visually', 'audibly', 'concert', 'beautifully', 'performed', 'recorded', 'lot', 'modern', 'productions', 'could', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'performance', 'how', 'record', 'concert', 'well.The', 'orchestra', 'wonderful', 'accompanyment', 'Glen', 'sound', 'rich', 'full', 'Glen', 'voice', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'more', 'admirable', 'performances', 'material', 'featured', 'particularly', 'songs', 'Gentle', 'My', 'Mind', 'Galveston', 'latter', 'fantastic', 'guitar', 'solo', 'had', 'playing', 'song', 'endlessly', 'everytime', 'goosebumps', 'Buy', 'enjoy', 'could', 'still', 'buy', 'New', 'Zealand', 'new', 'local', 'store', '25', 'NZ', 'disappointing', 'see', 'been', 'discontinued', 'manufacturer', 'not', 'easily', 'obtainable', 'USA']",Glen Campbell - In Concert
689203,A1TFSMCYA2F2VK,B00005Y6Z7,"Jason Derby ""major_boothroyd""","[5, 6]",Glen Campbell has to be one of music's greatest crossover artists and this DVD is a great showcase of the many aspects of his prodigeous talent. From his brilliant guitar playing on such classics as &quot;Galveston&quot; and the very well done &quot;Classical Gas&quot; to his smooth delivery of great songs like &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot; and &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot;. Campbell is an entertainer all the way.It must be noted that Campbell's voice is no longer what it used to be. It has taken on a much greater nasal sound and he no longer hits the high notes or makes the crescendos but nonetheless his performance is very good considering his age. What he lacks in youthful delivery he makes up for with some great interpreting. A fantastic rendition of Linda Ronstadt's &quot;Still Within the Sound of My Voice&quot; and one of the best versions ever of &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; along with a lovely cover of &quot;Time in a Bottle&quot;.

I've seen and heard artists / bands live and you quickly realize just how much is ""lost"" once they step outside the studio.

Even when I used to watch his summer replacement series for the Smothers Brothers back in the late 60's (boy, that seems like a 100 years ago and a totally different time), I didn't appreciate how talented a guitar player he was / is.I know Glen is living in the Phoenix area now and playing alot of golf, but clearly he's still picking up his guitar from time to time and honing his craft.Of course, all of the big hits are here - Witchita Lineman / Gentle On My Mind / Galveston and so many others. And they sound as good today as they did back in the 60's and 70's.You can say what you want about this guy, but there's no denying that he is one very, very talented singer / musician and I'm very glad that I decided to buy this DVD.It's going to get alot of playing.",4,Fantastic DVD,1173139200,"03 6, 2007",2007,1649,"['funny', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'thought', 'Glen', 'Campbell', 'years', 'other', 'notorious', 'mug', 'shot', 'DUI', 'arrest', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 'one', 'day', 'heard', 'Galveston', 'radio', 'remembered', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'guy.So', 'decided', 'purchase', 'live', 'concert', 'DVD', 'where', 'Glen', 'many', 'greatest', 'hits', 'being', 'accompanied', 'full', 'orchestra.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'talented', 'guy', 'actually', 'see', 'perform.Firstly', 'nothing', 'live', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'heard', 'artists', '/', 'bands', 'live', 'quickly', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'lost', 'step', 'studio', 'Not', 'so', 'Glen', 'voice', 'great', 'guy', 'close', '70', 'guitar', 'playing', 'something', 'else.I', 'knew', 'guy', 'was', 'good', 'knew', 'was', 'in-demand', 'studio', 'session', 'player', 'early', 'days', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'player', 'was', 'saw', 'DVD', 'Even', 'when', 'used', 'watch', 'summer', 'replacement', 'series', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'back', 'late', '60', 'boy', '100', 'years', 'ago', 'totally', 'different', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'how', 'talented', 'guitar', 'player', 'was', '/', 'is.I', 'know', 'Glen', 'living', 'Phoenix', 'area', 'now', 'playing', 'alot', 'golf', 'clearly', 'still', 'picking', 'up', 'guitar', 'time', 'time', 'honing', 'craft.Of', 'course', 'big', 'hits', 'are', 'here', 'Witchita', 'Lineman', '/', 'Gentle', 'My', 'Mind', '/', 'Galveston', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'sound', 'good', 'today', 'did', 'back', '60', ""70's.You"", 'can', 'say', 'what', 'want', 'guy', 'denying', 'one', 'very', 'very', 'talented', 'singer', '/', 'musician', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'decided', 'buy', 'DVD.It', 'going', 'get', 'alot', 'playing']",Glen Campbell - In Concert

Of course I had watched Glen on TV back in the day, and marveled at his stage presence and his great vocals, but especially at his smooth and effortless guitar playing.  How can anyone play so well and make it look so easy?Well, my family laughed at the idea of a GC DVD, until the first song started.  Then they were hooked.I am amazed that Glen can still sing and play as well as he does.  It's not easy to look and sound great when you are over 60.  He must still work at it really hard, and starting out with a very, very deep well of talent doesn't hurt.  He should be an inspiration to us.Thanks for that great DVD Glen.  Yes the orchestra behind him was quite good and very effective.My personal glimpse of Glen:  way back about 1980 I was at a commuter airline gate at Dallas when Glen walked up with Tanya Tucker in tow.
