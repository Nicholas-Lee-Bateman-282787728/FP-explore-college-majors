1411333,A2B6OX6FFLOLL0,B004J713JW,"A. W. Carter ""Hollywoodaholic""","[1, 1]","Billy Joel performed on my college student union patio back in 1974 and got so ticked off at the spotlight operator not following his antics around stage that he jumped on the top of his piano and stood there until the spotlight finally settled on him and tossed two large, glowing birds into the air and screamed, ""F--- You!""Billy Joel begins this fantastic closing performance at Shea Stadium in 2008 before it was torn down by ripping through his early anthem, ""Angry Young Man."" It's nice to know some things haven't changed. Oh, sure, he's now bald, grey, paunchy, and sweating buckets of water onto his keyboard on a hot summer night before a standing room only crowd of about 110,000. But the voice is still amazingly strong and supple, and the songs he goes through in this two and a half hour tour de force are the deep album cuts most long-term Billy Joel fans want to hear; from ""Miami 2017,"" to ""Captain Jack,"" to ""Goodnight, Saigon,"" to ""Scenes from an Italian Restaurant.""Guest stars like Garth Brooks, (""Shameless""), Tony Bennett (""New York State of Mind""), John Mayer (""This is the Time""), and Paul McCartney (""Let It Be"") show up to augment the festivities. But trust me on this one ... Billy Joel snarling and playing his piano and reminding you to ""Not take sh-- from anyone"" is plenty enough to stir your blood. It's fun to play `spot the celebrity' on the infield below the stage. Isn't that billionaire New York City mayor Bloomberg beaming widely right in the middle of the huddled, sweating masses? I wish I had been there.

The only minor complaint with the audio is that it requires more power for higher sound amplitude than some of my top rated audio concert DVD's. The mix is well balanced with the vocals,drums,guitar,bass and supporting instrumentation distinct. For this I would rate 4 stars. Overall it's 5 stars.

Granted, he was 60 at the time of the Shea show, but Bruce is the same age, and Bruce doesn't do nostalgia tours. He releases new music and tours playing new material.If you want to see the best live Billy Joel concert video, you'd have to look for an old VHS or a bootleg of 1983's 'Live From Long Island' which came out right after the 'The Nylon Curtain' album.I love Billy, but his energy, voice and talent were certainly more on full display 30 years back to greater effect.

But I tell you, I was blown away, he was excellent and actually showed more energy than Billy Joel.Which brings me to one of the negative things about this concert and one of the reasons I didn't give it 5 stars.Many of the songs, Billy looked and sounded like he was struggling and that his energy was flagging.  Sometimes he sang with very short, quick singing, sometimes almost talking, like he was out of breath and having trouble belting out the tunes.  I know he's not as young as he used to be (none of us are), but to me it really showed.The other negative is the band.  While individually, they all seemed like a very talented group of musicians, but compared to Billy's old band, they just didn't quite capture the magic.

Skelton ""Learning Freak""","[0, 0]","New Yorkers - off with your heads if you don't have this in your library.That said, I married a New Yorker and he wanted this for his birthday.It is amazing.Joel has been through some chizz in his life and I got a secret &#34;yes!!&#34; to see Christie Brinkley reduced to standing on the floor with the regular audience. Because this guy is just a musical genius. The back story is great as it shares about Joel's career, his personal life, and his inspirations over the years in between playing some just great music.A really cool part - he invited some of his friends to share songs with him and the most favorite of this non-native New Yorker was Garth Brooks singing &#34;Shameless.&#34;I haven't been able to get that performance by him and by Billy outta my head since we watched it two days ago. Gives me chills.When I heard that Billy Joel was going to be the last concert - the last anything at Shea I was like, &#34;whaaaaaat? Why?&#34;The goof was on me because I do not believe any other person, artist, genius could have laid Lady Shea to rest the way she deserved than the way Billy Joel did it. He may have even lifted her status up a few notches with his choice of sharing the stage with old and new friends -- shutting down Queens to bullet Sir Paul through NY air space through the airport red tape through traffic to Shea's doorstep was a small feat in and of itself --- to the diverse people he added on stage to pay tribute to NY events, to the choice of musical instruments he invited, to the light engineers he hired (who should get a separate award for the awesome light show and background graphics), to the very personal performance of his band, to the sharing of his heart in this entire performance, to the FOUR encores he did...there are no fitting words that do justice to this entire evening.

1411356,A1DRUTJB8KKDF1,B004J713JW,"R. L. Richards ""Underground Circus""","[17, 21]","I received my BluRay version today. Had read an earlier review about a bad audio mix from a Best Buy disc. Well, apparentely nothing has been done to correct it, because the 5.1 mix is not good. Billy voice way too loud, drums, especially cymbals and other percussion instruments pretty much go unheard, and with the size of the band on stage, it is empty sounding. Like something's missing. I have an upper mid-range sound system and it just sounds flat and hollow. Compared to many other Blu Ray's, and even regular DVD's it is not a good sounding disc. The picture is great. Absolutely no extras to be found, however.I turned down my center speaker quite a bit because Billy's voice was overpowering, but it still sounds empty.Update few weeks later: Depends on what equipment your listening to this on to determine sound issues. In the Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, Billy's voice is way too far out front in the center speaker and dominates the overall sound. And, there is basically nothing in the rear speakers. The PCM 5.1 mix is bassy and muffled. I've been listening to the DD 5.1 mix with the center channel turned down a bunch and the rear speakers turned up a bunch. It is OK, but the mix is also different and better in the three (Tyler, Daltrey, Mellencamp)bonus tracks for some reason.If you are listening to this through TV speakers in stereo or through a cheap all in one system, you're probably not going to notice any audio issues.Overall, I am very happy with the purchase, the show is fantastic. I think my initial shock at the sound mix dimmed my overall feelings. I just don't think that I should have to adjust my equipment for certain DVD's/BluRays to get the best sound. I know there are a few concert discs over the years that I've had to tweak somewhat, but very rare.",2,Bad audio mix (updated),1302048000,"04 6, 2011",2011,1789,"['received', 'BluRay', 'version', 'today', 'Had', 'read', 'earlier', 'review', 'bad', 'audio', 'mix', 'Best', 'Buy', 'disc', 'Well', 'apparentely', 'nothing', 'been', 'done', 'correct', '5.1', 'mix', 'not', 'good', 'Billy', 'voice', 'way', 'too', 'loud', 'drums', 'especially', 'cymbals', 'other', 'percussion', 'instruments', 'pretty', 'much', 'go', 'unheard', 'size', 'band', 'stage', 'empty', 'sounding', 'something', 'missing', 'have', 'upper', 'mid-range', 'sound', 'system', 'just', 'flat', 'hollow', 'Compared', 'many', 'other', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'even', 'regular', 'DVD', 'not', 'good', 'sounding', 'disc', 'picture', 'great', 'Absolutely', 'extras', 'be', 'found', 'however.I', 'turned', 'down', 'center', 'speaker', 'quite', 'bit', 'Billy', 'voice', 'was', 'overpowering', 'still', 'empty.Update', 'few', 'weeks', 'later', 'what', 'equipment', 'listening', 'determine', 'sound', 'issues', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'mix', 'Billy', 'voice', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'out', 'front', 'center', 'speaker', 'overall', 'sound', 'basically', 'nothing', 'rear', 'speakers', 'PCM', '5.1', 'mix', 'bassy', 'muffled', ""'ve"", 'been', 'listening', 'DD', '5.1', 'mix', 'center', 'channel', 'turned', 'down', 'bunch', 'rear', 'speakers', 'turned', 'up', 'bunch', 'OK', 'mix', 'also', 'different', 'better', 'three', 'Tyler', 'Daltrey', 'Mellencamp', 'bonus', 'tracks', 'reason.If', 'are', 'listening', 'TV', 'speakers', 'stereo', 'cheap', 'one', 'system', ""'re"", 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'notice', 'audio', 'issues.Overall', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'purchase', 'show', 'fantastic', 'think', 'initial', 'shock', 'sound', 'mix', 'dimmed', 'overall', 'feelings', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'have', 'adjust', 'equipment', 'certain', ""DVD's/BluRays"", 'get', 'best', 'sound', 'know', 'are', 'few', 'concert', 'discs', 'years', ""'ve"", 'had', 'tweak', 'somewhat', 'very', 'rare']",Billy Joel: Live at Shea Stadium
