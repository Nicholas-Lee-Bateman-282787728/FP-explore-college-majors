This is a glossy piece of junk.Turns out that person is me, I am embarrassed to admit.  Sure, I got into the show after it was on the air, but I am absolutely and totally hooked.  I am halfway through the second season and had to keep watching to find out whose the drugs were during the episode where Marissa had the birthday party for Trey and it got out of control and a girl overdosed and ended up in the pool.  Oops, spoiler, but this show is like video crack.But I know why it is.  The acting is quite good, the writing is clever and the reactions of the characters to the sometimes crazy situations on the show are genuine.  I particularly like Kirsten and Sandy.  Sandy isn't self righteous and Kirsten could have been written as a rich bitch, but she isn't.  I like Ryan too.  Sure, Benjamin McKenzie is really nice to look at but his character is interesting and you want to know what he is going to say and do next.  I agree with one of the previous posters.  The kids talk normally and whatever they say isn't overloaded with pop culture references they themselves do not seem to understand and wouldn't make in real life, like on the once good Gilmore Girls or the horrid Dawson's Creek.Good show.",4,I can't believe I am actually writing this,1191456000,"10 4, 2007",2007,1321,"['ragged', 'show', 'end', 'when', 'was', 'Who', 'attractive', 'people', 'stupid', 'problems', 'glossy', 'piece', 'junk.Turns', 'out', 'person', 'am', 'embarrassed', 'admit', 'Sure', 'got', 'show', 'was', 'air', 'am', 'absolutely', 'totally', 'hooked', 'am', 'halfway', 'second', 'season', 'had', 'keep', 'watching', 'find', 'out', 'drugs', 'were', 'episode', 'where', 'Marissa', 'had', 'birthday', 'party', 'Trey', 'got', 'control', 'girl', 'overdosed', 'ended', 'up', 'pool', 'Oops', 'spoiler', 'show', 'video', 'crack.But', 'know', 'why', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'writing', 'clever', 'reactions', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'crazy', 'situations', 'show', 'are', 'genuine', 'particularly', 'Kirsten', 'Sandy', 'Sandy', ""n't"", 'self', 'righteous', 'Kirsten', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'rich', 'bitch', ""n't"", 'Ryan', 'too', 'Sure', 'Benjamin', 'McKenzie', 'really', 'nice', 'look', 'character', 'interesting', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'say', 'do', 'next', 'agree', 'one', 'previous', 'posters', 'kids', 'talk', 'normally', 'say', ""n't"", 'overloaded', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'understand', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'real', 'life', 'once', 'good', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'horrid', 'Dawson', 'Creek.Good', 'show']",The O.C.: Season 2

907054,AKHP38ZBW5DRK,B0009K7QZ8,Basil Khamis,"[14, 19]","The O.C. is cleverly written & has been perfectly acted out. The cast has been handpicked to supply a never-ending torrent of melodrama & pleasantry that can't be found elsewhere - for the moment at least.While obvious comparisons to Beverly Hills 90210 are present, the show manages to hold its own. If you liked Beverley Hills 90210 & Melrose Place you'll love the OC. At first I thought I was better than this but after watching a couple of episodes I realized how good it was, not only that; it had this feeling of warmth that made you watch it & root for the underdog (Ryan). It felt a lot like 90210 but with a modern twist & also a bit more liberal.Season II is great, I can't quite choose between seasons I & II because they both were different in their own special way. In season I we were introduced to the many wonderful characters of The OC like Seth & Sandy Cohen who provide the comic relief that all productions need, & they do it very well - not your usual slapstick-ish type of comedy but a darker more cynical type of sarcasm that sort of gets under your skin. The serious side of the show is nearly always provided by Ryan & Marissa. The couple seems to get in a fight every episode due to lack of communication but always finds a way to make up. As for season II, it dwells deeper into the casts emotions, triumphs & tragedy. I say tragedy for a reason; see it to know. I wouldn't want to ruin it for you.A lot of the fans of the OC regard the last episode of Season II as the best ever; however I don't feel it to be right to single out one episode when the entire season has been terrific.If you haven't seen season I, then I'd advise you to get that first. Jumping straight into season II would be a tad confusing even for the most passionate soap fan.The OC is TV history in the making.

907056,AWVQR7YYTYJ1L,B0009K7QZ8,Brittany Rose,"[7, 7]","I know a lot of people out there these days buy television shows on DVD in order to watch them at their leisure - and commercial-free, so for those of you planning to pick up season 2 of the OC here is a quick recap of what to expect.The season opener commences a few months after the finale from season 1 - with Ryan living in Chino with pregnant Teresa and Seth living 'abroad' after his impromptu sailing expedition.  Back home things are on the messy side...Kirsten is depressed, Sandy is frustrated, and Summer and Marissa still aren't over their missing boys, at least not entirely.As you might have guessed, the OC wouldn't exist without Seth & Ryan and yes they do return...but that doesn't mean everything is rosy.  A crop of new characters enter and exit the OC social scene throughout the season, which is no longer marked by extravagant parties and constant fist fights.Most of the turmoil from this season comes from ever-changing relationships between ALL of the characters, including the adult leads.  Trysts, affairs, triangles, experimenting, questionable behaviour, fights, frustrations and secret (and not-so secret) crushes dominate this much more intricate season - and yet there are still many more questions to be answered in the coming season.Some of the new characters include teenagers Zach, Lindsay, and Alex, as well as adults Rebecca, Carter, Lance, and Reed, and the return of Ryan's older brother, Trey.  A few highlights of the season include the ""The SnO.C."", ""The Chrismakkah That Almost Wasn't"", ""The Power of Love"", ""The Rainy Day Women"", and the last three or four episodes.Altogether this is a strong season of the OC when looked back on, but it's missing a lot of one element that really propelled the show forward in it's first season - fun.  The stand-alone ""fun"" episodes seem out of place and unrealistic, and many of the storylines are much heavier and more depressing then what occured in the first season.  Still if you've watched the first season of the oc there is no doubt you will be clamoring to watch the second - so don't pass it up, it's still a great show overall.  Amusingly even Seth comments on how ""last year was so much better"" in the episode ""The Blaze of Glory"".

After the season 1 cliffhanger, the season opens with Seth Cohen somewhere in Oregon, refusing to come home to boring and snootie Orange County, now that all the fun has gone - see down to earth Ryan leaving the OC to become a dad back in Chino.The two boys gone, the girls, Marissa and Summer, waste away, one in anger (Summer), the other in pain and addiction (Marissa). To soothe the pain both girls get involved with other people and when the boys Seth and Ryan finally return, the plot thickens.

907060,AODOJ1UOO7HYR,B0009K7QZ8,D. Fox,"[1, 1]","If you've already seen season 1, buying season 2 is a MUST! Actually, I would be surprised if anyone who has seen season 1 hasn't seen season 2 yet. Luckily I purchased both of these season sets at the same time. The extreme emotional cliffhanger on the finale of season 1 was hard enough without having to wait for season 2 to arrive so I could see what happened. Like I said, I'm glad I purchased both at the same time!Well, rest assured that things get back to 'normal' in the OC right off the bat during this season! But, like any fan will know, 'normal' in the OC is a little different than you might expect. I don't want to spoil too much, but I can't resist spilling a few of the obvious details. Ryan and Seth are back as the unbeatable Newport Harbor duo, but what will Marissa and Summer's reactions be? Remember, Ryan left back to Chino to be with Teresa and the baby.  And Seth couldn't bare to lose his best friend after his life had changed so much for the better, so he left everyone behind as he sailed into the Pacific.  All the answers are in the premier, so watch and see.Naturally, the second season is filled with just as many surprises as the first, but you'll have to watch it to find out more. For any OC fan, this is a must! If you've thought about watching The O.C., but you don't think you'd like it, just give it a try and you won't be sorry! Please, though, buy both seasons together and you'll thank yourself later! Don't get caught in that cliffhanger without being able to pop in the first disc of season two.

907061,A2O8K7L29RLY54,B0009K7QZ8,"E. Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[1, 1]","It was no secret that the second season of The O.C. was a broad, scattershot, occasionally infuriating step down in quality from the fresh and original soap update the first season of The O.C. created.  Let's count the plots that we yawned through - Marisa and the yard guy, Ryan and Lindsay, Caleb's paternity scare and Lindsay, the threat of a trial against Caleb, crazy sexpot Jess, the relationship of Ryan and his brother, and - good god - the return of Sandy's ""true love"" Rebecca.  Plus, Summer and Seth's antics tested the measure of patience, even as we reluctantly felt knocked down by the thought they wouldn't wind up together.  And that's not to mention too much faux-indie-music-hocking at The Bait Shop, too many unfulfilled plot ideas, and too much coy self-reference (when Seth quips ""even The Valley was better last year!"" you're more likely to agree than giggle).  It was all representative of a wandering sophomore season realiant on too many tricks that didn't pay off.  Still, we watched, all of us that whined our way through these 22 episodes (and occasionally, as in fully magnificent episodes like ""Rainy Day Women,"" we were rewarded for sticking around).  That means the OC hadn't entirely lost its addictive freshness.  Kirsten's season-capping alcoholism was a dramatic miracle by comparison to some of the season's sluggish plotlines, and Kelly Rowan deserves credit for her stunning growth as an actress.  Plus, as unconvincing Mischa Barton's performance tends to be, it was hard not to sympathize with Marisa's personal angst - the pool-furniture throwing, the lesbian fling, the attack by Trey: they added up to a shockingly compelling year for Marisa.  And as for Melinda Clarke's Julie Cooper, she was a vibrant, captivating force that turned a funny, magnificently conniving villainnes into an occasionally wowing full-bodied character with a soft streak - she's now one of the most memorable characters of all network television.  The year was without a doubt frustrating as a whole (I'm particularly unsatisfied with its Marisa's-a-murderer! finale), but it's a sign of good days to come that very few of us second-season haters plan on missing what they'll do to these kids next year.",3,A mediocre but watchable season,1119484800,"06 23, 2005",2005,2224,"['was', 'secret', 'second', 'season', 'O.C', 'was', 'broad', 'scattershot', 'occasionally', 'infuriating', 'step', 'down', 'quality', 'fresh', 'original', 'soap', 'update', 'first', 'season', 'O.C', 'created', 'Let', 'count', 'plots', 'yawned', 'Marisa', 'yard', 'guy', 'Ryan', 'Lindsay', 'Caleb', 'paternity', 'scare', 'Lindsay', 'threat', 'trial', 'Caleb', 'crazy', 'sexpot', 'Jess', 'relationship', 'Ryan', 'brother', 'good', 'god', 'return', 'Sandy', 'true', 'love', 'Rebecca', 'Summer', 'Seth', 'antics', 'tested', 'measure', 'patience', 'even', 'reluctantly', 'felt', 'knocked', 'down', 'thought', 'would', ""n't"", 'wind', 'up', 'together', 'not', 'mention', 'too', 'much', 'faux-indie-music-hocking', 'Bait', 'Shop', 'too', 'many', 'unfulfilled', 'plot', 'ideas', 'too', 'much', 'coy', 'self-reference', 'when', 'Seth', 'even', 'Valley', 'was', 'better', 'last', 'year', ""'re"", 'more', 'likely', 'agree', 'giggle', 'was', 'representative', 'wandering', 'sophomore', 'season', 'realiant', 'too', 'many', 'tricks', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'off', 'Still', 'watched', 'whined', 'way', '22', 'episodes', 'occasionally', 'fully', 'magnificent', 'episodes', 'Rainy', 'Day', 'Women', 'were', 'rewarded', 'sticking', 'around', 'OC', 'had', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'lost', 'addictive', 'freshness', 'Kirsten', 'season-capping', 'alcoholism', 'was', 'dramatic', 'miracle', 'comparison', 'season', 'sluggish', 'plotlines', 'Kelly', 'Rowan', 'credit', 'stunning', 'growth', 'actress', 'unconvincing', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'performance', 'be', 'was', 'hard', 'not', 'sympathize', 'Marisa', 'personal', 'angst', 'pool-furniture', 'throwing', 'lesbian', 'fling', 'attack', 'Trey', 'added', 'up', 'shockingly', 'compelling', 'year', 'Marisa', 'Melinda', 'Clarke', 'Julie', 'Cooper', 'was', 'vibrant', 'captivating', 'force', 'turned', 'funny', 'magnificently', 'conniving', 'villainnes', 'occasionally', 'wowing', 'full-bodied', 'character', 'soft', 'streak', 'now', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'network', 'television', 'year', 'was', 'doubt', 'frustrating', 'whole', ""'m"", 'particularly', 'unsatisfied', ""Marisa's-a-murderer"", 'finale', 'sign', 'good', 'days', 'come', 'very', 'few', 'second-season', 'haters', 'plan', 'missing', 'what', ""'ll"", 'do', 'kids', 'year']",The O.C.: Season 2
907062,AC9B29BXXWJHD,B0009K7QZ8,Ellis Bell,"[8, 9]","Although the OC Season 2 hasn't been released yet, I have to say that I loved this show- although I think that the second season wasn't as good as the first, contentwise. But the show keeps maturing, which is excellent overall. On season one there was a lot more sex and intrigue, and they toned that down for season two.Season one left off when Ryan went back to Chino to be with pregnant Theresa, and Seth ended up sailing away. The first episode of season two opens with Sandy and Kirsten, who miss both boys very much. In an attempt to get Seth back, Sandy goes up to Portland, where Seth is staying with Luke and his father. Unsuccessful, Sandy gets Ryan to go up to Portland to do the same- with better results. Theresa lies about losing the baby, and encourages Ryan to go back to Orange County. Finally, both Seth and Ryan go home- setting up the events that take place in season 2.I am anticipating the release of this boxed set because I love this show so much. The OC is one of those shows that I can watch over and over again, and never get tired of. The producers really pay close attention to the history of each character, so that the season finale doesn't seem like a series of events that scream, ""season finale!"" I'm glad that Fox is airing the whole season again, two episodes every Thursday night, since I missed several episodes in the middle. In addition, the producers listened to fans gripe about there not being enough extras for season one, and so this time around there are a lot more. I absolutely cannot wait for season three to start on September 8th, as I'm sure that a lot will happen.",5,Season Two was excellent,1118966400,"06 17, 2005",2005,1617,"['OC', 'Season', '2', ""n't"", 'been', 'released', 'yet', 'have', 'say', 'loved', 'show-', 'think', 'second', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'first', 'contentwise', 'show', 'maturing', 'excellent', 'overall', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'sex', 'intrigue', 'toned', 'down', 'season', 'two.Season', 'one', 'left', 'off', 'when', 'Ryan', 'went', 'back', 'Chino', 'be', 'pregnant', 'Theresa', 'Seth', 'ended', 'up', 'sailing', 'away', 'first', 'episode', 'season', 'two', 'opens', 'Sandy', 'Kirsten', 'who', 'miss', 'boys', 'very', 'much', 'attempt', 'get', 'Seth', 'back', 'Sandy', 'up', 'Portland', 'where', 'Seth', 'staying', 'Luke', 'father', 'Unsuccessful', 'Sandy', 'Ryan', 'go', 'up', 'Portland', 'do', 'same-', 'better', 'results', 'Theresa', 'losing', 'baby', 'Ryan', 'go', 'back', 'Orange', 'County', 'Finally', 'Seth', 'Ryan', 'go', 'home-', 'setting', 'up', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'season', '2.I', 'am', 'anticipating', 'release', 'boxed', 'set', 'love', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'OC', 'one', 'shows', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'producers', 'really', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'history', 'character', 'season', 'finale', ""n't"", 'seem', 'series', 'events', 'scream', 'season', 'finale', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Fox', 'airing', 'whole', 'season', 'again', 'two', 'episodes', 'Thursday', 'night', 'missed', 'several', 'episodes', 'middle', 'addition', 'producers', 'listened', 'fans', 'gripe', 'not', 'being', 'enough', 'extras', 'season', 'one', 'so', 'time', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'absolutely', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'season', 'three', 'start', 'September', '8th', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'will', 'happen']",The O.C.: Season 2

Though perhaps not as consistant as its first flawless season, ""Season Two"" is nevertheless a compelling watch.Picking up where we left out awesome foursome: Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) is back in his hometown of Chino; Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) has been blackmailed into living with her mother, for whome she has much hatred; Seth Cohen (Adam Brody), distraught and lost after his best friend's departure, has run away to Portland; leaving his girlfriend Summer ROberts (Rachel Bilson) behind in Newport.Following the resolutions of these situations, come many more situations! These include: A long lost relative of the Cohens, a lesbian relationship, an ex-con coming to stay, a drug overdose, a near-rape, a divorce, a death and a shooting! Enough? 'Course not! I've merely skimmed the surface!This season, perhaps a bit more than ""Season One"" takes note on some very prominant issues in teenagers' lives. Issues including, homosexuality, rape violence are explored. I love that ""The OC"" goes into these relavant issues, as the majority of viewers are teenagers whome must face them in real life.Having said that, I also like how ""The OC"" always manages to have that comical edge to it. The screenplay, by Josh Schwartz, is full of more fantastic one-liners and wonderfully funny scenes, bringing out that ""OC"" style of never taking itself TOO seriously!Finally, the music as per usual, is fantastic. This is particularly thanks to the addition of ""The Bait Shop,"" a regular hang-out spot for the gang where bands perform live. It adds that extra ""OC-ish"" element to the show. The music definately has more of a prominant role in bringing out emotion and other moods to their full.And without giving too much away the finale of this 24-episode is, in my opinion, is the best ""OC"" episode ever made. THe ending left me utterly paralysed and craving for the third season!I thouroughly enjoyed this second season. My only criticism would maybe be that it started out a little dull, by it regained itself and finaled to a truly stunning finish! Through its great script-writing to the contagious music, ""The OC"" will be around for a little while yet!",5,"California, here we come again!",1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,2291,"['second', 'brilliant', 'season', 'OC', 'true', 'form', 'typically', 'halarious', 'comedy', 'times', 'controversal', 'drama', 'perhaps', 'not', 'as', 'consistant', 'first', 'flawless', 'season', 'Season', 'Two', 'nevertheless', 'compelling', 'watch.Picking', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'out', 'awesome', 'foursome', 'Ryan', 'Atwood', 'Benjamin', 'McKenzie', 'back', 'hometown', 'Chino', 'Marissa', 'Cooper', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'been', 'blackmailed', 'living', 'mother', 'whome', 'much', 'hatred', 'Seth', 'Cohen', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'distraught', 'lost', 'best', 'friend', 'departure', 'run', 'away', 'Portland', 'leaving', 'girlfriend', 'Summer', 'ROberts', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'Newport.Following', 'resolutions', 'situations', 'come', 'many', 'more', 'situations', 'include', 'long', 'lost', 'relative', 'Cohens', 'lesbian', 'relationship', 'ex-con', 'coming', 'stay', 'drug', 'overdose', 'near-rape', 'divorce', 'death', 'shooting', 'Enough', ""'Course"", 'not', ""'ve"", 'merely', 'skimmed', 'surface', 'season', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'more', 'Season', 'One', 'note', 'very', 'prominant', 'issues', 'teenagers', 'lives', 'Issues', 'including', 'homosexuality', 'rape', 'violence', 'are', 'explored', 'love', 'OC', 'relavant', 'issues', 'majority', 'viewers', 'are', 'teenagers', 'whome', 'must', 'face', 'real', 'life.Having', 'said', 'also', 'how', 'OC', 'always', 'have', 'comical', 'edge', 'screenplay', 'Josh', 'Schwartz', 'full', 'more', 'fantastic', 'one-liners', 'wonderfully', 'funny', 'scenes', 'bringing', 'out', 'OC', 'style', 'never', 'taking', 'TOO', 'seriously', 'Finally', 'music', 'usual', 'fantastic', 'particularly', 'thanks', 'addition', 'Bait', 'Shop', 'regular', 'hang-out', 'spot', 'gang', 'where', 'perform', 'live', 'extra', 'OC-ish', 'element', 'show', 'music', 'definately', 'more', 'prominant', 'role', 'bringing', 'out', 'emotion', 'other', 'moods', 'full.And', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'finale', '24-episode', 'opinion', 'best', 'OC', 'episode', 'ever', 'made', 'THe', 'ending', 'left', 'utterly', 'paralysed', 'craving', 'third', 'season', 'thouroughly', 'enjoyed', 'second', 'season', 'only', 'criticism', 'would', 'maybe', 'be', 'started', 'out', 'little', 'dull', 'regained', 'finaled', 'truly', 'stunning', 'finish', 'great', 'script-writing', 'contagious', 'music', 'OC', 'will', 'be', 'around', 'little', 'while', 'yet']",The O.C.: Season 2

907078,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B0009K7QZ8,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[6, 6]","Let me start by saying that I have no life. I am almost 30 years old and on Thursday nights I can't wait to sit down and watch as the lives of Ryan, Seth, Marissa, Summer, Julie, Sandy, Kirsten and the rest of the Newport elite unfold before my eyes. Maybe I am drawn to the show so that I can live vicariously through other people, but it doesn't matter. This is a show I don't miss.And even though I don't miss it, I found this DVD set to be fantastic, a welcome addition to a collection that is both eclectic and growing.Of course I never expected The O.C. to be as strong in the second season as it was in the first. After exploding on to the scene in its first season, there was sure to be a letdown and there was, but that doesn't change the fact that this is still an enjoyable television show with some great characters, solid writing and some good acting.The season opens where the first season left off (naturally) with Seth in Portland with Luke and his dad after sailing away in the season one finale. Ryan is back in Chino, living with Theresa, who is pregnant with their baby. Kirsten is knocked out by the departure of her two kids and has turned to the bottle a little more than normal. Sandy copes with her and the ongoing construction in the Cohen household. Marissa, with Ryan departing for Chino, has also hit the bottle and has been forced to live with her mother (Julie) and step-father (Caleb). Her father (Jimmy) is taking it easy on a boat with Kirsten's sister Hailey (Guest star Amanda Righetti) and Summer is still reeling from the departure of Seth and is trying to rid  herself of anything pertaining to him.Okay, now that we're caught up on where everyone is, it is time to talk about where everyone goes and in Season Two, some people certainly went places.Early on, Hailey took a job in Japan, jilting Jimmy, (Tate Donovan) who in a moment of desperation, proposes to her. Of course the Japan job was just a way to right Righetti out of the show so she could concentrate on the short-lived North Shore, which had debuted in the summer. Jimmy eventually also sailed away, which will be noted later.Theresa, noticing that Ryan (Ben McKenzie) seemed distant and basically still in love with Marissa (Mischa Barton), lied to him, telling him that she lost the baby and basically pushing him back to Newport and the Cohen's beach house. It becomes quickly obvious that she still has the baby, and this certainly can be a story line in season three and beyond. Preparing to return to Newport, Ryan, at Sandy's urging, goes to Portland to convince Seth (Adam Brody) to return and the two make a triumphant return to Newport Beach.Of course, Marissa and Summer (the delicious Rachel Bilson) are not immediately receptive of their two Knights in shining armor. Marissa has spent the summer drinking away the days and hooking up with the lawn boy, while Summer was devastated by Seth's departure and wants noting to do with him when he returns.Julie (Melinda Clarke) and Caleb's (Alan Dale) strange marriage continues to take even stranger turns, as Caleb is indicted and eventually is forced to reveal that he fathered a child with another woman while married to Kirsten's mother.And things continue to get interesting from there. Lindsay (Shannon Lucio), Caleb's illegitamite daughter, and Ryan begin dating before realizing just what the situation is with her father. The story line with Lindsay started out very strong, but fizzled out near the end, although it is questionable why she at least didn't come back for Caleb's funeral in the final episode. After all, he is her father.Summer moved on from Seth, meeting Zack, (Michael Cassidy) a water polo player who is interested in comics. Seth is torn between his friendship with Zack and his relationship with Summer. The triangle is a fantastic arc through the whole season and Cassidy, of the four new guest stars this season, lasted the longest and deservedly so. His Zack was someone you could root for, making it hard to hate him when he took Summer from Seth. The trio put together a graphic novel (Atomic County) and even pitched it to a couple reps with interesting results, including an all-out fight between Seth and Zack in a comic book store.Seth, with Summer seeking comfort with Zack, dated wild child Alex, a tattooed-club manager (Olivia Wilde). Alex was a great addition to the show for the time she was there, dating Seth and then eventually getting in a relationship with Marissa. The storyline with her was strong, like the LIndsay storyline, but eventually wore out. However, her club The Bait Shop, became a great set with bands playing in many different episodes.The Marissa and Alex relationship was only one of a few stories for Marissa. She also hooked up with DJ (Nicholas Gonzalez) her family's yard guy. That relationship pissed off Julie and eventually came to an end. The story line was never built strongly, and probably thankfully, as there became so many characters to focus on.Sandy (Peter Gallagher) and Kirsten (Kelly Rowan) suffered through their toughest year of marriage yet, as they were both tempted by others outside of their union. Sandy's ex Rebecca (Kim Delaney) returned for a short arc and Kirsten found herself attracted to Carter (Billy Campbell) an editor assigned to the Newport Group's new magazine. His departure pushed her further toward the bottle and eventually into rehab as the season concluded.Julie found herself cheating on Caleb with her ex, Jimmy. When the two were caught by Marissa, Jimmy figured the best thing to do was to get out and he sailed to Hawaii, only to return in the finale and in the start of season three. Caleb, possibly one of the creepiest men on television, also caught Julie with another ex, Lance (Johnny Messner). Lance managed to show Newport more of Julie than they every imagined, with a porn tape from her past. Caleb filed for divorce, but a heart attack, his second of the season, did him in in the season's penultimate episode. Ironically, Julie had called him to the house to basically poison him, but couldn't bring herself to do it.Ryan's brother, Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) also gave Newport living a try after being released from jail. He brought not only trouble, but some good story lines as well, as he tried to mend his former ways. Getting high and hitting on Marissa changed everything between the three (Ryan, Marissa and Trey) and eventually led to the shocking final scene, as Marissa shoots Trey as he and Ryan fight.As I have said, I am addicted to this show, so I was bound to like this set. But the two commentary tracks added a good insight to the show, as did a good blooper reel, a feature on fashion and the Obsessed Completely special that ran prior to the start of the season.All in all, a fine effort.

However, there are some improvements that make this season great.While last year she was a little over dramatic and not teen-like, Mischa Barton has improved in her role of Marissa Cooper this year. I personally think she should stop playing teenagers. The girl did Shakespeare off-Broadway when she was 7. Maybe she's too good of an actress to play Marissa, or maybe she just doesn't have chemistry with Ben McKenize. As Ryan, McKenzie shows a softer, less violent side this year, however, his look for the role is still better than his acting.And now to the two gems of the show, Adam Brody and Rachel Bilson, as nerotic geek Seth Cohen and typical beach girl Summer Roberts. These two are probably the performers with the best comic timing and maybe the best acting abilty, second only to Peter Gallagher. How both of them have been overlooked for Emmys is very sad.Peter Gallagher is an idol to many up and coming actors. He has tremednous range. He can play crooks comically like in ""Mr. Deeds"" and musically like in the stage revivals of ""Pal Joey"" and ""Guys and Dolls."" However, I think Sandy Cohen will be the role he is best remembered for. Not only is he the center of the show, but he is the best characther. As his wife, Kelly Rowan shows a lot of growth this year, especially with her alcholic story line.As Caleb Nichol, Alan Dale continues to be dreadfully boring and stuck up. However, I must say my new favorite adult woman on the show is Julie Cooper. With an obviosuly good sense of comic timing and great, still comic, acting skills, she has improved much this year.Tate Donovan, who appeared in the finale and at the beginning of this season as Jimmy Cooper also is a strong moral center of the show.While last year told the stories of the four central teens, this year some others entered their lives, mainly Zach, played by an actor who's name I can't recall and Alex, played by Oliva Wilde. While these kids were pretty good, they will probably not be as well remembered as Samaire Armstrong's charachter of Anna.And as Trey, Mr. What's his name (sorry, I forgot the actor's name) is also just as brooding as McKenzie, but a much better actor. The atempted rape scene in episdoe 21 was scary and realistic, one of the best scenes all season.This year, most of the memorable and well written episodes are by brillaint series creator Josh Schwartz. If only they'd do more audio commentaries and give us some more bonuse.FOX should be proud of this show, it isn't your average Teen Soap.",4,The OC: Season 2 DVD Set,1125273600,"08 29, 2005",2005,2648,"['scripts', 'stories', 'acting', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'wonderful', 'brillaint', 'first', 'season', 'great', 'show', 'still', 'darned', 'good', 'show', 'However', 'are', 'improvements', 'make', 'season', 'great.While', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'little', 'dramatic', 'not', 'teen-like', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'improved', 'role', 'Marissa', 'Cooper', 'year', 'personally', 'think', 'should', 'stop', 'playing', 'teenagers', 'girl', 'did', 'Shakespeare', 'off-Broadway', 'when', 'was', '7', 'Maybe', 'too', 'good', 'actress', 'play', 'Marissa', 'maybe', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'chemistry', 'Ben', 'McKenize', 'Ryan', 'McKenzie', 'softer', 'less', 'violent', 'side', 'year', 'however', 'look', 'role', 'still', 'better', 'acting.And', 'now', 'two', 'gems', 'show', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'nerotic', 'geek', 'Seth', 'Cohen', 'typical', 'beach', 'girl', 'Summer', 'Roberts', 'two', 'are', 'probably', 'performers', 'best', 'comic', 'timing', 'maybe', 'best', 'acting', 'abilty', 'second', 'only', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'How', 'have', 'been', 'overlooked', 'Emmys', 'very', 'sad.Peter', 'Gallagher', 'idol', 'many', 'up', 'coming', 'actors', 'tremednous', 'range', 'can', 'play', 'crooks', 'comically', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'musically', 'stage', 'revivals', 'Pal', 'Joey', 'Guys', 'Dolls', 'However', 'think', 'Sandy', 'Cohen', 'will', 'be', 'role', 'best', 'remembered', 'Not', 'only', 'center', 'show', 'best', 'characther', 'wife', 'Kelly', 'Rowan', 'lot', 'growth', 'year', 'especially', 'alcholic', 'story', 'line.As', 'Caleb', 'Nichol', 'Alan', 'Dale', 'be', 'dreadfully', 'boring', 'stuck', 'up', 'However', 'must', 'say', 'new', 'favorite', 'adult', 'woman', 'show', 'Julie', 'Cooper', 'obviosuly', 'good', 'sense', 'comic', 'timing', 'great', 'still', 'comic', 'acting', 'skills', 'improved', 'much', 'year.Tate', 'Donovan', 'who', 'appeared', 'finale', 'beginning', 'season', 'Jimmy', 'Cooper', 'also', 'strong', 'moral', 'center', 'show.While', 'last', 'year', 'told', 'stories', 'four', 'central', 'teens', 'year', 'others', 'entered', 'lives', 'mainly', 'Zach', 'played', 'actor', 'who', 'name', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'Alex', 'played', 'Oliva', 'Wilde', 'kids', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'well', 'remembered', 'Samaire', 'Armstrong', 'charachter', 'Anna.And', 'Trey', 'Mr.', 'What', 'name', 'sorry', 'forgot', 'actor', 'name', 'also', 'just', 'as', 'brooding', 'McKenzie', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'atempted', 'rape', 'scene', 'episdoe', '21', 'was', 'scary', 'realistic', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'season.This', 'year', 'most', 'memorable', 'well', 'written', 'episodes', 'are', 'brillaint', 'series', 'creator', 'Josh', 'Schwartz', 'only', ""'d"", 'do', 'more', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'give', 'more', 'bonuse.FOX', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'show', ""n't"", 'average', 'Teen', 'Soap']",The O.C.: Season 2

Clearly, it deserves a number 2 ranking (1,2,4, worst season ever: 3) in the OC season pantheon.Yes, there are some misses: Mallpisode, Any scene with Mischa Barton that did not include Olivia Wilde, Lindsay/Ryan awful romance, most of the Zach/Seth comic book stuff, and of course DJ trying to steal Ryan's thunder as Marissa's boyfriend who doesn't talk.But to judge a season you need to look at the hits, and there were many: Great Caleb season all around, Kiki's drinking problem (fresh margs anyone?), Olivia Wilde incredible breakout lesbian performance, The Bait Shop somehow becoming the number 1 performing venue in the country, Christmakkuh 2, Julie Coops, and Summer/Seth Spiderman scene.  Plus, WHO KILLED CALEB?  Spoiler.You could probably skip like 6-8 episodes (since theres 24 which is absurd) to enjoy this even more.  I recommend drinking heavily while watching.",5,"Only $9.99 for Seth and the gang?

907093,AIRHRV3D8X4J1,B0009K7QZ8,"Porfie Medina ""Porfie Jr. Medina""","[139, 152]","The O.C. Season 2 is just as good as the first season. I like the fact that the show is not just about kids in high school, but also their parents and family and how they all interact. The cast is really good and believable enough to either make you love them or hate them. The show is very emotional at times and it is very addicting. I think what scared me away before I ever saw an episode was that I figured The O.C. was just another show about rich kids in California like Beverly Hills 90210 and/or Melrose place. The show is so much more than those other shows and has just the right amount of drama mixed in with just the right amount of heart. I highly recommend The O.C. for anyone who likes must see TV. This Complete Second season of The O.C. will be released on August 23rd, 2005 just in time for the premiere of season 3 in the Fall. This 7-DVD set will contain all 24 episodes from the second season, and a disc full of bonus material, too. The great news is that unlike season 1 season 2 will be in Widescreen. There will be an English Dolby Surround audio track, along with English, French and Spanish subtitles.Here's a list of the bonus material you'll find on this:The Wet and Wilde Kisses - outtakes from the ""Rainy Day Women"" episodeBeachy Couture: How O.C.

907094,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0009K7QZ8,Robert Moore,"[6, 8]","Many people seem to have been disappointed with Season Two of THE O.C., but I can't count myself among them. The show definitely had a more adult feel, even in the teen story lines, and the overall mood was definitely more somber. Whether this is an improvement or a decline will largely depend on one's personal preferences. As a whole, I found Season Two consistently held my attention and always left me concerned about the fate of the major characters.Personally, I liked one thing about Season Two a lot, and that is the way they slowed down the developments in relationships. How many times did Ryan and Marisa break up and get back together in Season One? Too many times for me to find it believable. How many times did they break up in Season Two? None. How many times did they get back together? Once. I personally found that far more satisfying than the relational seesaw of Season One. The road to true love for Seth and Summer was a tad bumpier, but I liked the patience they displayed in developing even that more mercurial plot line.As with Season One, the story arcs involving the adults were as interesting or perhaps more interesting than those for the teens. Sandy Cohen just might be my favorite character on television these days, with the exception of several on LOST. What I love about him is his absolute dedication to living by a moral code, and sticking to that code even when it complicates other relationships. When an old flame returns to town, he helps her even though it hurts his marriage by making Kirsten jealous. But despite the fact that he knows Kirsten is jealous, he sticks with doing what he knows is right. Television has had in its history few believable moral characters. Most do-gooders seems cardboard at best, but Sandy Cohen is seems more like flesh and blood. But it is a tough year for Kirsten, simultaneously bothered by Sandy's helping his ex-girlfriend and smitten by the new editor hired to help with her company's new magazine. The twin pressures of what she senses as betrayal by Sandy (even if she is wrong) and the temptation represented by her coworker drive her to drink more and more heavily, resulting in her being sent at the end of the season to a treatment center for alcoholism.As much as I love most things on THE O.C., there have been some things I have had a hard time stomaching each year. In Season One it was the cardboardish Luke Ward and the absolutely horrific Oliver, and the unlikable Caleb Nichol in both. Also hard to take in Season Two was Alex Kelly, who managed to be--briefly--a bad girlfriend to Seth and a jealous lesbian girlfriend for Marisa. The problem is that her character never managed to become anything more than two-dimensional, and was perhaps even less interesting with Marisa than she had been with Seth. I also have not enjoyed Julie Cooper-Nichol in either season. She brings a DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES element to the show that I don't find especially welcome, and always seems to be the one recurring character of the show that is more a cardboard cartoon than well-conceived individual. She did become a bit more interesting towards the end, especially in the final episode where she pulls back from poisoning Caleb, who is intending to divorce her, only to find him at the bottom of the swimming pool after suffering a heart attack.The character with the toughest season was, by far, Marisa. After Ryan returns, her hopes of getting back together with him are squashed when he discovers that she is in the final throes of a fling with a gardener. She then struggles with alcohol and a up-and-down lesbian relationship before reuniting with Ryan before an attempted rape by Ryan's brother and her killing him in the finale while he is apparently beating Ryan to death. Ah, the very stuff of high class soap opera.What keeps THE O.C. from drifting down into the same depths as other soap operas is the overall sharpness of the writing, the vividly conceived and executed characters, and the show's unwillingness to sink into pathos. In fact, from beginning to end the show toys more with self-irony than pathos.Having avoided a sophomore slump, I hope that the show continues on to an excellent third season. In one way, a show like this is much harder to keep going than a show like LOST or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. Those shows were able to structure their narrative around a host of stories. THE O.C., like THE GILMORE GIRLS and similar shows, depends on conflicts between characters. Here's hoping they can keep it going a third season.",5,Another stellar season of sharply written show,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,4535,"['Many', 'people', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'Season', 'Two', 'THE', 'O.C.', 'ca', ""n't"", 'count', 'show', 'definitely', 'had', 'more', 'adult', 'feel', 'even', 'teen', 'story', 'lines', 'overall', 'mood', 'was', 'definitely', 'more', 'somber', 'improvement', 'decline', 'will', 'largely', 'depend', 'one', 'personal', 'preferences', 'whole', 'found', 'Season', 'Two', 'consistently', 'held', 'attention', 'always', 'left', 'concerned', 'fate', 'major', 'characters.Personally', 'liked', 'one', 'thing', 'Season', 'Two', 'lot', 'way', 'slowed', 'developments', 'relationships', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'did', 'Ryan', 'Marisa', 'break', 'up', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'Season', 'One', 'Too', 'many', 'times', 'find', 'believable', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'did', 'break', 'up', 'Season', 'Two', 'None', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'did', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'Once', 'personally', 'found', 'far', 'more', 'satisfying', 'relational', 'seesaw', 'Season', 'One', 'road', 'true', 'love', 'Seth', 'Summer', 'was', 'tad', 'bumpier', 'liked', 'patience', 'displayed', 'developing', 'even', 'more', 'mercurial', 'plot', 'line.As', 'Season', 'One', 'story', 'arcs', 'involving', 'adults', 'were', 'interesting', 'perhaps', 'more', 'interesting', 'teens', 'Sandy', 'Cohen', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'favorite', 'character', 'television', 'days', 'exception', 'several', 'LOST', 'What', 'love', 'absolute', 'dedication', 'living', 'moral', 'code', 'sticking', 'code', 'even', 'when', 'other', 'relationships', 'When', 'old', 'flame', 'town', 'even', 'marriage', 'making', 'Kirsten', 'jealous', 'fact', 'Kirsten', 'jealous', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'Television', 'had', 'history', 'few', 'believable', 'moral', 'characters', 'Most', 'do-gooders', 'cardboard', 'best', 'Sandy', 'Cohen', 'more', 'flesh', 'blood', 'tough', 'year', 'Kirsten', 'simultaneously', 'bothered', 'Sandy', 'helping', 'ex-girlfriend', 'smitten', 'new', 'editor', 'hired', 'help', 'company', 'new', 'magazine', 'twin', 'pressures', 'what', 'betrayal', 'Sandy', 'even', 'wrong', 'temptation', 'represented', 'coworker', 'drive', 'drink', 'more', 'more', 'heavily', 'resulting', 'being', 'sent', 'end', 'season', 'treatment', 'center', 'alcoholism.As', 'much', 'love', 'most', 'things', 'THE', 'O.C.', 'have', 'been', 'things', 'have', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'stomaching', 'year', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'cardboardish', 'Luke', 'Ward', 'absolutely', 'horrific', 'Oliver', 'unlikable', 'Caleb', 'Nichol', 'Also', 'hard', 'take', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'Alex', 'Kelly', 'who', 'managed', 'be', 'briefly', 'bad', 'girlfriend', 'Seth', 'jealous', 'lesbian', 'girlfriend', 'Marisa', 'problem', 'character', 'never', 'managed', 'become', 'anything', 'more', 'two-dimensional', 'was', 'perhaps', 'even', 'less', 'interesting', 'Marisa', 'had', 'been', 'Seth', 'also', 'have', 'not', 'enjoyed', 'Julie', 'Cooper-Nichol', 'season', 'DESPERATE', 'HOUSEWIVES', 'element', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'especially', 'welcome', 'always', 'be', 'one', 'recurring', 'character', 'show', 'more', 'cardboard', 'cartoon', 'well-conceived', 'individual', 'did', 'become', 'bit', 'more', 'interesting', 'end', 'especially', 'final', 'episode', 'where', 'back', 'poisoning', 'Caleb', 'who', 'intending', 'divorce', 'only', 'find', 'bottom', 'swimming', 'pool', 'suffering', 'heart', 'character', 'toughest', 'season', 'was', 'far', 'Marisa', 'Ryan', 'returns', 'hopes', 'getting', 'back', 'together', 'are', 'squashed', 'when', 'final', 'throes', 'fling', 'gardener', 'then', 'alcohol', 'up-and-down', 'lesbian', 'relationship', 'reuniting', 'Ryan', 'attempted', 'rape', 'Ryan', 'brother', 'killing', 'finale', 'apparently', 'beating', 'Ryan', 'death', 'Ah', 'very', 'stuff', 'high', 'class', 'soap', 'O.C', 'drifting', 'down', 'same', 'depths', 'other', 'soap', 'operas', 'overall', 'sharpness', 'writing', 'vividly', 'conceived', 'executed', 'characters', 'show', 'unwillingness', 'sink', 'pathos', 'fact', 'beginning', 'end', 'show', 'more', 'self-irony', 'pathos.Having', 'avoided', 'sophomore', 'slump', 'hope', 'show', 'excellent', 'third', 'season', 'one', 'way', 'show', 'much', 'harder', 'keep', 'going', 'show', 'LOST', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'shows', 'were', 'able', 'structure', 'narrative', 'host', 'stories', 'O.C.', 'THE', 'GILMORE', 'GIRLS', 'similar', 'shows', 'conflicts', 'characters', 'Here', 'hoping', 'can', 'keep', 'going', 'third', 'season']",The O.C.: Season 2
