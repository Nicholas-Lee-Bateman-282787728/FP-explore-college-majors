Never in any other picture did Williams display her considerable acting talents.  She is terribly good here - both in her acting and in her swimming.Rounding out the cast is Victor Mature, Walter Pidgeon (as her loving father), Donna Corcoran (as the young Annette), and David Brian.There are lavish costumes and beautiful period sets.  The entire production is flawless.",5,Williams' best movie,987033600,"04 12, 2001",2001,807,"['MILLION', 'DOLLAR', 'MERMAID', 'Esther', 'Williams', 'best', 'work', 'film', 'most', 'successful', 'attempt', 'combining', 'passable', 'dramatic', 'story', 'water', 'ballet', 'was', 'crucial', 'plot', 'story.Esther', 'Williams', 'famed', 'Australian', 'swimmer', 'Annette', 'Kellerman', 'who', 'wowed', 'audiences', 'London', 'New', 'York', 'Hippodrome', 'beautiful', 'water', 'ballets.Williams', 'good', 'Kellerman', 'have', 'character', 'well', 'hand', 'Never', 'other', 'picture', 'did', 'Williams', 'display', 'considerable', 'acting', 'talents', 'terribly', 'good', 'here', 'acting', 'swimming.Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'Victor', 'Mature', 'Walter', 'Pidgeon', 'loving', 'father', 'Donna', 'Corcoran', 'young', 'Annette', 'David', 'Brian.There', 'are', 'lavish', 'costumes', 'beautiful', 'period', 'sets', 'entire', 'production', 'flawless']",N/A
