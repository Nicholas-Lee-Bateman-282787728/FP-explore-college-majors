I watched it to the end of series 3, when WE stopped carrying it.I purchase series 1 from amazon, and it is very good, because it is about the girls and the ranch and daily travails.Later in the series, boyfriends and whatnot intrude and it becomes more complicated. I am hoping to buy series 4 someday, but it is being released very slowly.

She first got hooked when it was on one of our U.S. cable channels, but it was dropped after the 3rd season. Then there seemed to be issues getting the acceptable DVD format for US players. Finally, all the seasons are available and she can get her ""fix!"" For my wife, this series is #1 and she does not watch other soaps. For U.S. viewers: if you remember ""Dallas"", then McLeod's Daughters is an Australian production of similar proportions, but more believable. This series is well acted & well done! Some will find this priced expensively, but the price per episode would be similar to Itunes' prices and there is no puzzle for me in shopping for a present for my wife!
