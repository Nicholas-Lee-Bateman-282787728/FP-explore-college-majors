1456444,ATSFS4004URM7,B005E7SEZW,"Jim Phillips ""Experience is what you get when...","[7, 8]","Overall I can't complain about the production value.  They have been re-mastered and the work was good.  The language options page is easy to use and the English version seems better than most movies.  No long screams to fill in words.Story line and action wise is another matter.  I will list each movie separatelyMartial Arts Of Shaolin;  It has a very young Jet Li as the main character.  He has to be young he never would have agreed to do this after he was established.  His Shaolin monk character eats meat is obsessed with revenge and has a silver bracelet that he has had since he was a baby and is teaching a gang of urchins kung-fu.  Any one of these would have been unbelievable adding them altogether was just hilarious.  As a saving grace though, the Martial action in this movie was pretty good.Five Shaolin Masters;  Story line was at least believable.  The packaging calls this ""one of the best cinematic displays of martial arts ever""  I disagree, I thought the fights were way to slow and the styles way to rigid.  The weapons were interesting but they seemed way to powerful.Executioners of Shaolin;  This was enjoyable.  Believable (well more believable) plot line and the action was well choreographed.Mad Monkey Kung Fu; Ok I have to admit I enjoyed this.  Couple of big mistakes in the overall plot.  But if you just shrug it off and enjoy the story as presented its pretty good.",4,They measure Ultimate the way most men measure six inches,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,1402,"['Overall', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'production', 'value', 'have', 'been', 're-mastered', 'work', 'was', 'good', 'language', 'options', 'page', 'easy', 'use', 'English', 'version', 'better', 'most', 'movies', 'long', 'screams', 'fill', 'words.Story', 'line', 'action', 'wise', 'matter', 'will', 'list', 'movie', 'separatelyMartial', 'Arts', 'Shaolin', 'very', 'young', 'Jet', 'Li', 'main', 'character', 'be', 'young', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'agreed', 'do', 'was', 'established', 'Shaolin', 'monk', 'character', 'eats', 'meat', 'obsessed', 'revenge', 'silver', 'bracelet', 'had', 'was', 'baby', 'teaching', 'gang', 'urchins', 'kung-fu', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unbelievable', 'adding', 'altogether', 'was', 'just', 'hilarious', 'saving', 'grace', 'Martial', 'action', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good.Five', 'Shaolin', 'Masters', 'Story', 'line', 'was', 'least', 'believable', 'packaging', 'one', 'best', 'cinematic', 'displays', 'martial', 'arts', 'ever', 'disagree', 'thought', 'fights', 'were', 'way', 'slow', 'styles', 'way', 'rigid', 'weapons', 'were', 'interesting', 'seemed', 'way', 'powerful.Executioners', 'Shaolin', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'Believable', 'well', 'more', 'believable', 'plot', 'line', 'action', 'was', 'well', 'choreographed.Mad', 'Monkey', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Ok', 'have', 'admit', 'enjoyed', 'Couple', 'big', 'mistakes', 'overall', 'plot', 'just', 'shrug', 'off', 'enjoy', 'story', 'presented', 'pretty', 'good']",Dragon Dynasty's Ultimate Kung Fu 4pk
