92436,AKV9F8HZ7XX0B,0790729717,AC,"[3, 5]","I watched this film last night, and its power, depth, and beauty continue to reverberate in my mind, heart, and soul.As much as this involves an African-American cast and characters, this story is (and I was glad to hear one of the actors convey this during an interview, found in the Special Features) a story about people (and not solely African-Americans), and a time... and is, at its heart (and as conveyed by another of the actors, in one of the Special Features), a story about people having the ability to transform, and to grow, and to become someone they didn't know that they could.And whether that growth and transformation is one that involves 'finding a voice', or any of various other forms of transformation, achieving it can take years, and can involve significant hardship, pain, and heartbreak -- but can be (and often is) aided along by the help, love, and inspiration of others -- but after it occurs, people are 'never the same', and the positive outcome can and often does beget yet more positive change and outcome for those whose paths one crosses, and whose lives one touches...This story also involves a portrayal of the deep and abiding love, and indescribable closeness that is felt by many sisters, and for that matter, can be found among siblings whose childhoods involve unspeakable and/or shared pain and/or the reality of a difficult circumstance (an understatement) that results in some siblings finding themselves in the role of a 'protector', or otherwise having profound (and warranted) concern for the safety and wellbeing of a sibling.The story involves the painful-to-imagine, painful-to-'witness', and unfathomable-to-endure circumstance of a girl who is 'given' to a man, to be his domestic slave and 'subject' to rape, and to be a mother to his children -- a circumstance that was also present within society at large, and not just African-Americans, and is part of what makes this story important for all to see, and regardless of whatever color one's skin might happen to be.There are so many things that one could comment on regarding this film, and I don't want to say 'too much', when it comes to those who haven't seen it yet, but suffice it to say, this movie is a masterpiece in every respect imaginable -- the story, the script, the acting, the direction, the cinematography, the scoring, composition, and performance of music, the sets -- everything.  This movie's overall power, depth, and impact of emotion to heart and soul, is profound.You feel empathy, emotional pain, sadness, anger, heartbreak, and moments that render one speechless, and stunned... and you also feel deeply moved by moments of sweetness, tenderness, kindness, and love... and you ultimately feel indescribable joy and happiness, and can be overcome with emotion at the end -- don't be surprised if you don't just cry, but temporarily bawl (and even if you've never done that before as a result of any movie you've ever seen).No movie has ever before swept me along so many emotional 'currents', let alone in such a deep and utterly spellbinding way.This movie would seem to be the greatest I've ever seen -- I find myself at a loss as to what, of anything else I've seen, can 'top' it.In viewing the Special Features, from the 2nd disc of the 2-disc Special Edition, I was surprised to learn that the terminal sequence of one especially powerful scene had not been scripted, and that the actress whose repeated cries of, ""Why?!"", which seemed delivered from the depths of a soul, and were accompanied by a physical movement that forms one of the lingering 'visuals' of the film, in my mind -- the actress who spontaneously engaged in that repeated agonizing question, and one that could be perceived to have been asked 'of the universe', and not just the one being to whom it was physically being 'directed', commented in the Special Features that saying that 'line' and engaging in those actions felt natural, and that it was delivered after the realization that she was no longer holding on to her/the character's sister -- and Steven Spielberg had instructed the actresses who were portraying the siblings to not let Danny Glover's character 'pull them apart' (realizing, of course (and regardless of whether he conveyed it aloud), that at some point it would happen)... Steven Spielberg's comments in the Special Features included mention of how at a certain point near the beginning of filming, he essentially abandoned rehearsals, and let the actors 'go into' these difficult sequences on the day(s) of shooting... Steven Spielberg also mentioned that the scene I just alluded to, in which Danny Glover's character engages in actions to separate the sisters, and involves emotional and physical aspects that render the scene one of great intensity (and the acting, on the part of the actresses who portrayed the sisters, and the nearly visceral pain of their being separated, is astonishing) -- Steven Spielberg conveyed (in the Special Features) how that was a very difficult scene for Danny Glover to engage in, given the cruelty of the character he needed to portray -- Steven Spielberg mentioned that that day was a 'bad day', emotionally, for Danny... I wonder at times how difficult it must be for various actors to deliver various performances that involve intensely negative and cruel actions, dialogue, and/or emotion... whatever 'place' they need to 'go to', in their minds, to deliver such a performance, is undoubtedly quite difficult, at times... but the realism of what gets portrayed is important, and provides an aspect of the 'impact' that a given film can (and in this case, absolutely does) have...Lastly, I'll never understand how this film was not given even a single Oscar (and despite 11 nominations, no less), let alone the Academy Award for Best Picture.  Everything about this film was superlative.  And the fact that Steven Spielberg wasn't even nominated, for Best Director, will remain one of life's mysteries, as far as I'm concerned.I cannot recommend this film highly enough... and its brilliance and power go beyond words...",5,"I have now finally seen this astonishing masterpiece, and am blown away by it",1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,6092,"['watched', 'film', 'last', 'night',

Having really only sampled Whoopi Goldberg as a comedian, I was blown away at how well she portrayed Celie, especially as she matures emotionally from a frightened little girl to a abused and distant wife and finally to a strong and confident woman. The relationship between Celie and Shug is beautifully portrayed, and is extremely nuanced as each woman aids the other in their spiritual and emotional growth. Glover, too, acts wonderfully here, and it is fascinating to see his character evolve as well (a feature of the novel that could have easily been swept aside in the Hollywood desire for a completely irredeemable villain) from a cruel, emotionally dead man to one who regrets the things he has done and the opportunities he has lost.I would greatly recommend this movie to anyone, but I would also recommend that you read the novel first if you haven't already. Because the novel covers such a long period of time (most of Celie's life, really), it was necessary for the movie to cut many events, and while it did so in the best possible way, there's still a lot of material worth reading in the novel that will help to understand the movie and why the characters feel and act the way they do.~ Ana Mardoll",5,Lovely Rendition of the Famous Novel,1253923200,"09 26, 2009",2009,1607,"['Color', 'Purple', '/', 'B000P0J092If', 'read', 'enjoyed', 'Walker', 'Color', 'Purple', 'then', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'love', 'movie', 'possibly', 'one', 'most', 'faithful', 'book', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'very', 'little', 'praise', 'could', 'heap', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'heaped', 'novel', 'as', 'far', 'movie-only', 'elements', 'go', 'should', 'note', 'how', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'movie', 'Having', 'really', 'only', 'sampled', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'comedian', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'how', 'well', 'portrayed', 'Celie', 'especially', 'emotionally', 'frightened', 'little', 'girl', 'abused', 'distant', 'wife', 'finally', 'strong', 'confident', 'woman', 'relationship', 'Celie', 'Shug', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'extremely', 'nuanced', 'woman', 'other', 'spiritual', 'emotional', 'growth', 'Glover', 'too', 'wonderfully', 'here', 'fascinating', 'see', 'character', 'evolve', 'as', 'well', 'feature', 'novel', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'swept', 'aside', 'Hollywood', 'desire', 'completely', 'irredeemable', 'villain', 'cruel', 'emotionally', 'dead', 'man', 'one', 'who', 'things', 'done', 'opportunities', 'lost.I', 'would', 'greatly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'read', 'novel', 'first', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'novel', 'covers', 'such', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'most', 'Celie', 'life', 'really', 'was', 'necessary', 'movie', 'cut', 'many', 'events', 'did', 'so', 'best', 'possible', 'way', 'still', 'lot', 'material', 'worth', 'reading', 'novel', 'will', 'help', 'understand', 'movie', 'why', 'characters', 'feel', 'act', 'way', 'do.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",N/A

92443,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790729717,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","One of those movies that touches a person differently with each viewing, `The Color Purple' may be a perfect film.  It's hard to take, sometimes overly dramatic (this may be uplifting and inspiring in the end, but getting there is a rough journey) but Steven Spielberg almost takes a Ron Howard approach to his filmmaking and creates a film that is dramatic yet heartwarming, with enough elements of purity that make the heavy-handed delivery seem as smooth as butter.  Now I have not read Alice Walker's novel, but I really want to now, so I can't say if the film is as faithful as it should have been; but judging the film on its own merit there is no fault I can find, no fault at all.The film tells the tragic story of Celie Johnson, a young woman abused by her father (birthing him two children) and sold to an older man who wants a woman to help him around the house (he has a slew of children and no wife).  Celie takes the place of her younger sister, whom her father is not done abusing, Celie is sold into a life of torment and abuse at the hands of the unhappy Albert (or Mister).  The film spans over forty years as Celie grows up reclusive and bitter only to have her spirits and her eyes opened when the boisterous and soulful Shug Avery comes into her life.  Shug, one time lover to Albert, has some troubles of her own, but her way of dealing with them far outshine the way Celie has dealt with hers, and she helps Celie to come into her own and take back the life she should have had to begin with.This is such a beautifully constructed story of oppression, not just by the hands of white men as is so often depicted, but `The Color Purple' paints a disturbing portrait of abuse and oppression within one's own family.  Celie is oppressed by her father and then Albert.  Albert is oppressed by his own father and his feelings for Shug.  Shug is oppressed by the disapproval of her parents and her feelings for Albert and even Celie.  The young and defiant Sofia is oppressed by her own actions, which result in her oppression at the hands of those around her, from her husband to her eventual masters.  There is a tragic circle of abuse and control that is only broken when these individuals start to think and act for themselves, segregating themselves from the hands of their oppressors and becoming their own person.This film is aiding by some of the most moving and effective performances I've seen committed to film.  Danny Glover is emotionally scaring as Albert, a man confused and embittered by his own conflictions.  Adolph Caesar is menacing as Albert's domineering father, and his character helps us to understand Albert, a man who is very hard to understand on his own.  Margaret Avery and Oprah Winfrey (both of whom were Oscar nominated) give amazing performances.  Oprah is at one moment in-you-face with her abrasive attitude, the next minute concealed and broken.  These two variations of character help her build this woman from the ground up.  Margaret Avery is beyond fantastic as Shug.  The way she effortlessly wraps herself around Celie and dominates her thinking and actions is heart-reaching.This movie belongs to Whoopi Goldberg though.  Yes, Whoopi delivers what may be one of the greatest female performances of all time.  She never breaks her characters emotional state, delivering to us a woman who has been conditioned by her surroundings.  She is reclusive and unsteady, feeble and alone.  She walks hunched and fearful; she speaks soft and unsure.  She is afraid to smile.  She is afraid to converse.  She is afraid to be herself, but when her fire is ignited and her inner person is unleashed she is finally freed from her cage and given the chance to break away from those holding her down.  Her final confrontation scene at the dinner table is one of the most earth shattering scenes in my movie watching history.  To think that this was her debut performance (as it was Oprah Winfrey's).  It pains me when I think of the fact that she LOST the Oscar (I can't believe this went 0/11 at the Oscars).In the end I highly recommend this movie to any and everyone.  This is a truly emotional film that connects with the audience on a deep and personal level.  This is not a film about racism.  This is a film about oppression, and each and every one of us has been oppressed at one point in our lives.

92445,AK6UVFSU07NXH,0790729717,Anthony Hinde,"[6, 6]","""The Color Purple"" has so many messages, moral and otherwise, that they blur together into what can only be described as wisdom. As an Australian I can't claim to know a lot about the black experience in the south, in the early 20th century. Despite that, I get a strong sense of realism from this film, in the same way we are forced to believe someone when they admit a degrading fact about themselves.The heart of this movie is a woman named Celie. Woopie Goldberg was cast in the role and it represents her first cinematic outing. She was nominated for an  Academy Award and, in my opinion, should have won it. Celie doesn't get to talk much, is subservient to many of the larger powers in her life and yet still manages to communicate depths of emotion few of us ever see in our own lives.Our sympathies go out to Celie from the start, when we see her as a child playing in a meadow with her sister, Nettie. Hidden at first, her pregnancy is soon revealed, as the result of an incestuous rape. Celie, still a child, is soon separated from her own offspring, for the second time and then torn apart from her sister, as Celie is consigned to her new husband. Married life becomes another form of servitude, including the same chores, sexual abuse and mental anguish but  without her sister's love. Nettie somehow gets shipped of to Africa, as a nanny to some missionaries. We only see enough of her life to know that it is a rich and fulfilling one, in stark contrast to Celie's.Celie has a strange and extended family. Her husband, Albert, called only ""Mister"" by Celie, is a petty and deliberately cruel man. He seems to sense that there is more value in Celie than he will ever possess and thus never stints in holding his power over her. Albert's mistress, Shug Avery, is a degraded yet stylish club singer who eventually loves Celie more than Albert. He was never more than a passing convenience to Shug. Albert has a son from a previous marriage, Harpo. For some reason, the strongest character in the film, Sofia, played very convincingly by Oprah Winfrey, decides she is going to marry Harpo and does just that. In many ways, Sofia's rude  awakening to the realities of her world, at the hands of the local mayor, his wife and the police, is sadder than Celie's plight. After all, Celie never had hopes or expectations to lose.As the story progresses, Celie starts to emerge from her cocoon. Helped in part by her husband's mistress. She becomes aware of her own inner beauty and her own power. This transformation is so gradual that we almost believe nothing is changing but by the end of the film, Celie is a woman in control of her own destiny and a force for good in her community. We are not asked to believe that patience is all that is required to overcome evil. Celie has her fair share of confrontations and setbacks. Instead we learn that even the palest plant, deprived of sunlight all its life, may eventually blossom into something special. All it may need is a little encouragement.I don't watch The Color Purple as regularly as some of the other films in my collection. It is hard going in spots. But, if you ever start feeling a little sorry for yourself, I recommend this movie. Not only will it put your troubles into proper perspective but it will also lift up your heart as few films can.",4,Fate can take a twisted path,1021248000,"05 13, 2002",2002,3318,"['Color', 'Purple', 'so', 'many', 'messages', 'moral', 'otherwise', 'blur', 'together', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'wisdom', 'Australian', 'ca', ""n't"", 'claim', 'know', 'lot', 'black', 'experience', 'south', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'get', 'strong', 'sense', 'realism', 'film', 'same', 'way', 'are', 'forced', 'believe', 'someone', 'when', 'admit', 'degrading', 'fact', 'themselves.The', 'heart', 'movie', 'woman', 'named', 'Celie', 'Woopie', 'Goldberg', 'was', 'cast', 'role', 'first', 'cinematic', 'outing', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'opinion', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Celie', ""n't"", 'get', 'talk', 'much', 'subservient', 'many', 'larger', 'powers', 'life', 'yet', 'still', 'communicate', 'depths', 'emotion', 'few', 'ever', 'see', 'own', 'lives.Our', 'sympathies', 'go', 'out', 'Celie', 'start', 'when', 'see', 'child', 'playing', 'meadow', 'sister', 'Nettie', 'Hidden', 'first', 'pregnancy', 'soon', 'revealed', 'result', 'incestuous', 'rape', 'Celie', 'still', 'child', 'soon', 'separated', 'own', 'offspring', 'second', 'time', 'then', 'torn', 'apart', 'sister', 'Celie', 'consigned', 'new', 'husband', 'Married', 'life', 'form', 'servitude', 'including', 'same', 'chores', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'mental', 'anguish', 'sister', 'love', 'Nettie', 'somehow', 'shipped', 'Africa', 'nanny', 'missionaries', 'only', 'see', 'enough', 'life', 'know', 'rich', 'fulfilling', 'one', 'stark', 'contrast', ""Celie's.Celie"", 'strange', 'extended', 'family', 'husband', 'Albert', 'called', 'only', 'Mister', 'Celie', 'petty', 'deliberately', 'cruel', 'man', 'sense', 'more', 'value', 'Celie', 'will', 'ever', 'possess', 'thus', 'never', 'stints', 'holding', 'power', 'Albert', 'mistress', 'Shug', 'Avery', 'degraded', 'yet', 'stylish', 'club', 'singer', 'who', 'eventually', 'Celie', 'more', 'Albert', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'passing', 'convenience', 'Shug', 'Albert', 'son', 'previous', 'marriage', 'Harpo', 'reason', 'strongest', 'character', 'film', 'Sofia', 'played', 'very', 'convincingly', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'going', 'marry', 'Harpo', 'just', 'many', 'ways', 'Sofia', 'rude', 'awakening', 'realities', 'world', 'hands', 'local', 'mayor', 'wife', 'police', 'sadder', 'Celie', 'plight', 'Celie', 'never', 'had', 'hopes', 'expectations', 'lose.As', 'story', 'Celie', 'emerge', 'cocoon', 'Helped', 'part', 'husband', 'mistress', 'aware', 'own', 'inner', 'beauty', 'own', 'power', 'transformation', 'so', 'gradual', 'almost', 'believe', 'nothing', 'changing', 'end', 'film', 'Celie', 'woman', 'control', 'own', 'destiny', 'force', 'good', 'community', 'are', 'not', 'asked', 'believe', 'patience', 'required', 'overcome', 'evil', 'Celie', 'fair', 'share', 'confrontations', 'setbacks', 'Instead', 'learn', 'even', 'palest', 'plant', 'deprived', 'sunlight', 'life', 'may', 'eventually', 'blossom', 'something', 'special', 'may', 'need', 'little', 'encouragement.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Color', 'Purple', 'as', 'regularly', 'other', 'films', 'collection', 'hard', 'going', 'spots', 'ever', 'start', 'feeling', 'little', 'sorry', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Not', 'only', 'will', 'put', 'troubles', 'proper', 'perspective', 'will', 'also', 'lift', 'up', 'heart', 'few', 'films', 'can']",N/A

Karpe ""ARKendall""","[3, 4]","I hadn't seen this film in many years and when it was released on DVD I was curious to see if the story and the performances had the impact I remembered.  Let me assure you, they have.  Alice Walker's novel (a masterpiece) is faithfully translated by director Spielberg and a perfect cast.  It tells the story of two poor sisters, Celie and Nettie, growing up in the South of the early 1900's.  All these girls have is one another having been abused and torn apart first by a monstrous stepfather and then by the manacing Mister, who marries Celie when he is forbidden to have Nettie.  When Nettie refuses Mister's advances, he separates the sisters and Celie is doomed to spend a lifetime caring for her husband and his wild children, all the time waiting for word from her beloved Nettie which never seems to come.  Enter Mister's mistress, the singer Shug Avery, at first Celie's nemesis and then her champion who helps reunite the sisters.  Whoopi Goldberg delivers a soulful, devastating performance developing Celie from downtrodden girl to proud, strong woman.  Danny Glover's Mister is a fully realized portrait of an abusive alcoholic who turns out to be not as evil as we suspected.  Oprah Winfrey, Margarey Avery, Dana Ivey and Adolph Caeser complete the superlative ensemble, and Spielberg wisely focuses on storyline and character, giving us just enough visual beauty to make this a modern classic on all levels.  Ms. Walker's message is universal: all things want love, even, as Shug Avery tells Celie, the color purple.  Ultimately it is a celebration of life and the human spirit, something with which each of us can connect.",5,A Film That Improves With Age,980985600,"02 1, 2001",2001,1641,"['had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'many', 'years', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'story', 'performances', 'had', 'impact', 'remembered', 'Let', 'assure', 'have', 'Alice', 'Walker', 'novel', 'masterpiece', 'faithfully', 'translated', 'director', 'Spielberg', 'perfect', 'cast', 'story', 'two', 'poor', 'sisters', 'Celie', 'Nettie', 'growing', 'up', 'South', 'early', '1900', 'girls', 'have', 'one', 'having', 'been', 'abused', 'torn', 'apart', 'first', 'monstrous', 'stepfather', 'then', 'manacing', 'Mister', 'who', 'Celie', 'when', 'forbidden', 'have', 'Nettie', 'When', 'Nettie', 'Mister', 'advances', 'sisters', 'Celie', 'doomed', 'spend', 'lifetime', 'caring', 'husband', 'wild', 'children', 'time', 'waiting', 'word', 'beloved', 'Nettie', 'never', 'come', 'Enter', 'Mister', 'mistress', 'singer', 'Shug', 'Avery', 'first', 'Celie', 'nemesis', 'then', 'champion', 'who', 'reunite', 'sisters', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'soulful', 'devastating', 'performance', 'developing', 'Celie', 'downtrodden', 'girl', 'proud', 'strong', 'woman', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Mister', 'fully', 'realized', 'portrait', 'abusive', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'not', 'as', 'evil', 'suspected', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'Margarey', 'Avery', 'Dana', 'Ivey', 'Adolph', 'Caeser', 'complete', 'superlative', 'ensemble', 'Spielberg', 'wisely', 'storyline', 'character', 'giving', 'just', 'enough', 'visual', 'beauty', 'make', 'modern', 'classic', 'levels', 'Ms.', 'Walker', 'message', 'universal', 'things', 'want', 'love', 'even', 'Shug', 'Avery', 'Celie', 'color', 'purple', 'Ultimately', 'celebration', 'life', 'human', 'spirit', 'something', 'can', 'connect']",N/A

92451,A1Y1IMKX8ZRV4Y,0790729717,Ben Adam,"[9, 9]","I saw The Color Purple first in the cinemas in 1985 when it first came out. I remember the scandal when it failed to win a single Academy Award after it received eleven nominations. After I saw the films that won the Oscars, I felt the outrage. This movie deserved the award for Best Picture without a doubt, and while some people could have debated if Whoopi Goldberg deserved Best Actress, hindsight would have ended that debate instantly, because it was the only time she ever played a role with subtlety; she was magnificent, and there's no arguing that point.The arguments against the film were that the film is a tear-jerker, the story stereotypes all the women as virtuous, all the men as evil, all the whites as victimizers -- but this is an adaptation of a novel, not an original screenplay, and the blame for these shortcomings lies in the Alice Walker original novel, not Steven Spielberg's work. Alice Walker's works all revolve around similar themes, so anyone familiar with her writings knows what to expect. Some critics claimed that Spielberg's rendition made the story seem much too glamorous, too glorified, too sweet, but years later, those criticisms seem too absurd to take seriously, as the stark realism that he later revealed in Schindler's List is evident in the scenes of brutality in which Celie is brutally raped and does her best to survive the experience.The story is, however, a very emotional one, the story of a bond between two sisters who grew up under very difficult conditions by anybody's definition. It is the bond betwee those two sisters, the separation that takes place between them, and their ultimate reunion, that is the heart of the story, with a lot that happens along the way that can move mountains.The performances of Margaret Avery and Oprah Winfrey are unforgettable and earned them Oscar nominations. Danny Glover as her brutal husband Albert appears as most of the men in the movie appear, but he is afforded the chance to show a true character that develops and grows as the story progresses so that at the end, he is able to show his repentance in the only way he knows how. Throughout the film, the sumptuous score of Quincy Jones gives a special touch that after twenty years has not lost its charm.The film did not receive nearly as much credit as it deserved in 1985, which was criminal enough. As many times as I have seen it since, the more I have come to admire the film and realize just how monumental it really was.The funny thing is that I remember on the day that I was sitting in the movie theater when I first saw the film (I was in Tel Aviv at the time, I remember), I had a key chain that was designed to beep when a person would whistle. When the music would start or when Whoopi Goldberg would shriek, the key chain would go off every time. I was constantly trying to cover it up so as not to disturb the people around me. Since that first viewing, I have found it much more relaxing to watch the film without such distractions, but even so, the film truly is a masterpiece, and it deserves all the credit that it did not receive in 1985.",5,The Color Purple Is Cinema Royalty,1108771200,"02 19, 2005",2005,3111,"['saw', 'Color', 'Purple', 'first', 'cinemas', '1985', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'remember', 'scandal', 'when', 'failed', 'win', 'single', 'Academy', 'Award', 'received', 'eleven', 'nominations', 'saw', 'films', 'won', 'Oscars', 'felt', 'outrage', 'movie', 'deserved', 'award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'doubt', 'people', 'could', 'have', 'debated', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Actress', 'hindsight', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'debate', 'instantly', 'was', 'only', 'time', 'ever', 'played', 'role', 'subtlety', 'was', 'magnificent', 'arguing', 'point.The', 'arguments', 'film', 'were', 'film', 'tear-jerker', 'story', 'women', 'virtuous', 'men', 'evil', 'whites', 'victimizers', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'not', 'original', 'screenplay', 'blame', 'shortcomings', 'Alice', 'Walker', 'original', 'novel', 'not', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'work', 'Alice', 'Walker', 'works', 'revolve', 'similar', 'themes', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'writings', 'what', 'expect', 'critics', 'claimed', 'Spielberg', 'rendition', 'made', 'story', 'seem', 'much', 'too', 'glamorous', 'too', 'glorified', 'too', 'sweet', 'years', 'later', 'criticisms', 'seem', 'too', 'absurd', 'take', 'seriously', 'stark', 'realism', 'later', 'revealed', 'Schindler', 'List', 'evident', 'scenes', 'brutality', 'Celie', 'brutally', 'raped', 'best', 'survive', 'experience.The', 'story', 'however', 'very', 'emotional', 'one', 'story', 'bond', 'two', 'sisters', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'very', 'difficult', 'conditions', 'anybody', 'definition', 'bond', 'betwee', 'two', 'sisters', 'separation', 'place', 'ultimate', 'reunion', 'heart', 'story', 'lot', 'way', 'can', 'move', 'mountains.The', 'performances', 'Margaret', 'Avery', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'brutal', 'husband', 'Albert', 'most', 'men', 'movie', 'appear', 'afforded', 'chance', 'show', 'true', 'character', 'story', 'so', 'that', 'end', 'able', 'show', 'repentance', 'only', 'way', 'how', 'film', 'sumptuous', 'score', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'special', 'touch', 'twenty', 'years', 'not', 'lost', 'charm.The', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'credit', 'deserved', '1985', 'was', 'criminal', 'enough', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'have', 'come', 'admire', 'film', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'monumental', 'really', 'funny', 'thing', 'remember', 'day', 'was', 'sitting', 'movie', 'theater', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'Tel', 'Aviv', 'time', 'remember', 'had', 'key', 'chain', 'was', 'designed', 'beep', 'when', 'person', 'would', 'whistle', 'When', 'music', 'would', 'start', 'when', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'would', 'shriek', 'key', 'chain', 'would', 'go', 'off', 'time', 'was', 'constantly', 'trying', 'cover', 'up', 'so', 'not', 'disturb', 'people', 'first', 'viewing', 'have', 'found', 'much', 'more', 'relaxing', 'watch', 'film', 'such', 'distractions', 'even', 'so', 'film', 'truly', 'masterpiece', 'credit', 'did', 'not', 'receive', '1985']",N/A

92454,A4P7HYSOIVBLL,0790729717,Bonnie McKinzie,"[1, 3]","The Color Purple, 1985, was perhaps, the first  movie that I saw with Whoopi.  Just that fact alone would have given it at least 3 stars.  But,  add Danny Glover and Oprah Winfrey and you have an almost guaranteed  hit!Filmed and dressed so accurately for its time frame in the early  1900's,  the story opens with a heartwrenching scene of a young Black girl  giving birth to a child of incest that she is forced by her father to place  for adoption. She never forgets this child, and spends her entire life  looking for her daughter.Celie, played by Whoopi Goldberg as an adult,  is a strong, undefeatable character in spite of her horrible life and  circumstances.  When she finds herself the wife (slave would be a better  term)of the man she calls Mister, she is determined to be herself and  return someday to something better.  This includes contact with her sister  whom she sometimes feels is her only family friend.Contrary to what we  would consider normal marital relations, Celie is actually happy and  thankful for the mistress in her husband's life.  Whenever &quot;Shug&quot;  is present, &quot;Mister&quot; thankfully leaves Celie alone in favor of  his lady friend. A strong friendship is formed between the 2 women,  climaxing in a kissing scene which I never expected. But, Shug definitely  has talent as well as insight and she knows the real reasons why Celia  pampers her and shows no disdain.Racism is played out in its ugliest  form.  The scene where Opray Winfrey's character, Sophie, is beaten and  degraded made me cry. Embarrassed and humiliated in front of a crowd who  just stood there and watched was disgusting. How anyone could treat others  that lowly is beyond me. Her later portrayal of an empty, scarred, ugly  woman who lost her beloved children is so very, very sad.The superiority  of Black men over women was portrayed extremely openly.  I do not know if  this was factual for that timeframe, location and race, but somehow I don't  think so.  However, I asked a good friend who is Black and male and he  seemed to think it was not terribly out of the ordinary.Since I am a  literacy teacher, the scenes of Celie's learning to read were superb!  Looking back, I see that reading was one thing that could be well hidden  and used only when and if it was needed. A shame, but I guess it was true  then.I loved the music and singing and the graphic demonstration of  their idea of a swinging nightclub where Shug sang and cavorted.When  Celia finally had a chance to leave, I cheered her on, watching and  expecting her to cement her intentions. Her looks, words and actions as the  car pulled away were excellent!I was a little surprised at what was  hidden in  the chicken coop. That twist was a definite plus for the film.  Of course, the hidden letters were a pivotal point in the movie as  well.The title and the color purple were not clear to me until the very  end, but I felt Steven Spielberg did a remarkable job and for the life of  me, I cannot understand why, with 11 Academy Award nominations it did not  win at least 3 or 4!I have not read the Pulitzer prize winning book of  the same name by Alice Walker upon which the film is based, but I would  like to do so.If this was Whoopi's first movie, she started off  excellent, and is still excellent!  I am happy we bought the widescreen  version, and happy we found decided to purchase this great film of Stephen  Spielberg's!",4,Whoopi Goldberg &amp; Oprah Winfrey's First Film!,962236800,"06 29, 2000",2000,3428,"['Color', 'Purple', '1985', 'was', 'perhaps', 'first', 'movie', 'saw', 'Whoopi', 'Just', 'fact', 'alone', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'least', '3', 'stars', 'add', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'have', 'almost', 'guaranteed', 'hit', 'Filmed', 'dressed', 'so', 'accurately', 'time', 'frame', 'early', '1900', 'story', 'heartwrenching', 'scene', 'young', 'Black', 'girl', 'giving', 'birth', 'child', 'incest', 'forced', 'father', 'place', 'adoption', 'never', 'child', 'entire', 'life', 'looking', 'daughter.Celie', 'played', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'adult', 'strong', 'undefeatable', 'character', 'spite', 'horrible', 'life', 'circumstances', 'When', 'wife', 'slave', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'term', 'man', 'Mister', 'determined', 'be', 'return', 'someday', 'something', 'better', 'contact', 'sister', 'whom', 'sometimes', 'feels', 'only', 'family', 'friend.Contrary', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'normal', 'marital', 'relations', 'Celie', 'actually', 'happy', 'thankful', 'mistress', 'husband', 'life', 'Whenever', 'quot', 'Shug', 'quot', 'present', 'quot', 'Mister', 'quot', 'thankfully', 'Celie', 'alone', 'favor', 'lady', 'friend', 'strong', 'friendship', 'formed', '2', 'women', 'climaxing', 'kissing', 'scene', 'never', 'expected', 'Shug', 'definitely', 'talent', 'as', 'well', 'insight', 'real', 'reasons', 'why', 'Celia', 'disdain.Racism', 'played', 'out', 'ugliest', 'form', 'scene', 'where', 'Opray', 'Winfrey', 'character', 'Sophie', 'beaten', 'degraded', 'made', 'cry', 'Embarrassed', 'humiliated', 'front', 'crowd', 'who', 'just', 'stood', 'watched', 'was', 'disgusting', 'How', 'anyone', 'could', 'treat', 'others', 'lowly', 'later', 'portrayal', 'empty', 'scarred', 'ugly', 'woman', 'who', 'lost', 'beloved', 'children', 'so', 'very', 'very', 'sad.The', 'superiority', 'Black', 'men', 'women', 'was', 'portrayed', 'extremely', 'openly', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'was', 'factual', 'timeframe', 'location', 'race', 'somehow', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'However', 'asked', 'good', 'friend', 'who', 'Black', 'male', 'seemed', 'think', 'was', 'not', 'terribly', 'ordinary.Since', 'am', 'literacy', 'teacher', 'scenes', 'Celie', 'learning', 'read', 'were', 'superb', 'Looking', 'back', 'see', 'reading', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'could', 'be', 'well', 'hidden', 'used', 'only', 'when', 'was', 'needed', 'shame', 'guess', 'was', 'true', 'then.I', 'loved', 'music', 'singing', 'graphic', 'demonstration', 'idea', 'swinging', 'nightclub', 'where', 'Shug', 'sang', 'cavorted.When', 'Celia', 'finally', 'had', 'chance', 'leave', 'cheered', 'watching', 'expecting', 'cement', 'intentions', 'looks', 'words', 'actions', 'car', 'pulled', 'away', 'were', 'excellent', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'what', 'was', 'hidden', 'chicken', 'coop', 'twist', 'was', 'definite', 'plus', 'film', 'course', 'hidden', 'letters', 'were', 'pivotal', 'point', 'movie', 'well.The', 'title', 'color', 'purple', 'were', 'not', 'clear', 'very', 'end', 'felt', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'did', 'remarkable', 'job', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', '11', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'least', '3', '4', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Pulitzer', 'prize', 'winning', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Alice', 'Walker', 'film', 'based', 'would', 'like', 'do', 'so.If', 'was', 'Whoopi', 'first', 'movie', 'started', 'off', 'excellent', 'still', 'excellent', 'am', 'happy', 'bought', 'widescreen', 'version', 'happy', 'found', 'decided', 'purchase', 'great', 'film', 'Stephen', 'Spielberg']",N/A

92459,A2KGCK3Q4VARC8,0790729717,Christopher Greffin,"[1, 3]","The Color Purple is a wonderous movie directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the novel of the same name. This may not be one of his best films, but that's like saying Rebecca isn't one of Hitchcock's best, or that Once Upon a Time in America isn't one of Scorsese's best. It's heartbreaking but uplifting, sad but joyous. Every single second entertains, and there isn't an offnote performance by a single major castmember. The story at its core is a great one of the darkness, love, frailty, and goodness of the human spirit.Woopie Goldberg gives a much superior performance in my opinion than to her Oscar winning one in Ghost. I should say this film is infamous for being nominated for eleven Academy Awards and not winning a single one. That's a shame but not really a surprise. It's doesn't play as the kind of epics the academy likes: straightforward and realistic. Oprah Winfrey and Margret Avery round out a terrific line of staring women roles who have tremendoug influence on Goldberg's victimized character. Some have complained this movie makes the women all look great while the men look like scum. Well I simply can't agree. The women characters are all generally good people, but are not flawless, and the male characters, outside Danny Glover's intensly dislikable one and the dad character early in the movie, are generally likable as well. It's a story that's about women uplifting themselves off dire situations, and even if it does tug on too many emotional strings to get there, the path at which it arrives still feels great.There are things one can nitpic about this movie. In aditions to what I mentioned above, one may claim it's like a fairy tale. Well weren't Snow White and Cinderella great fairly tale movies as well. Sure it uses characters that probably wouldn't have been there in the real world to go from one plotline to the next. It's probably not a film one should look for historical realism in. To me it comes down to great characters in a great story that's inspirational and can make one look to the brightness in the world. I cried and I didn't care if I was slightly manipulated while doing so.

This became one of the best movies released that year.  The only complaint is that this received 11 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, and it didn't win any.  That was wrong!  Its plot, based on Alice Walker's novel, is brilliant.  It digs deep into the events and the characters throughout, while never holding back a drop of emotion.  Such substance keeps the audience guessing every future event and double checking every detail.  Its layers of storylines keep the chain of events interesting.  It proves that there's more to Celie's life than just her own trials.  She changes many lives in a good way and not realizing it.Whoopi Goldberg made a triumphant movie debut in her role as Celie Johnson, a woman being abused by her husband and yearns for a better life.  She rightfully earned a Golden Globe win and an Oscar nomination both for Best Actress.  Oprah Winfrey and Margaret Avery rightfully earned their Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress as Sophie and Shug, strong female fighters who survived past life trials.  Danny Glover's role as Celia's abusive husband is one of the best performances in his career.  The entire cast, major or minor, placed every drop of heart and soul through their characters.The wardrobes and the setting were constructed wonderfully.  Every detail looks like ""The Color Purple"" was actually filmed in the early 1900's.  The research and the hard work shines.  Its background offers a gloomy look into the characters' harsh lifestyles and the sad plot.  This seems to have allowed the cast to express themselves deeper.  Without it, the movie wouldn't have the same level of emotion that attracts the audience.

Whoopi Goldberg never got another role like this one, showing her incredible and untapped acting talent by way of Steven Spielberg's inspired and altogether ambitious direction.  Mr. Spielberg was not even nominated for Best Director(Shame on you, Academy voters!).  It was great to hear that he did win the Director's Guild Award(handed out by his peers), but this horrible oversight still needles me to this day.  Back to the acting.  Oprah Winfrey was given an Oscar nomination, as was Margaret Avery, but there are so many stunning performances here from the entire cast that pointing out any standout performances is nearly impossible.  There is also some clever film editing(certainly the most under-rated facet of filmmaking), that keeps the film constantly fresh and the story moving forward with some fantastic cinematography.  The only thing that breaks the continuity is that the character ""Celie"" is played by two different actresses, while her sister ""Nettie"" is played by a single actress both at a young age and when she is older.  It is really a small discrepancy given that both actresses that play ""Celie"" are excellent(in particular, Whoopi Goldberg).  For those who know only Whoopi's fairly lame films like ""Burglar,"" I guarantee you will be pleasantly surprised by her amazing work here.  There are many moments in the film that are so genuinely touching and heartfelt that by the end of the final scene I suddenly realized that it never felt so good to cry.

This is truly a blow to such a beautiful, heartbreaking, shiningly beautiful film that depicts horrendous examples of human brutality and abuse (child rape, domestic violence and everyday racism) and also shows in the example of the main character, Celie (a beautiful and understated Whoopi Goldberg), how the human spirit has the strength to overcome unthinkable odds.This story was masterfully translated from Alice Walker's novel to the screen by director Steven Speilberg.  Though, this was a controversial move in the eyes of many in the African-American community (that is, when some weren't protesting the novel's depiction of abusive, unfaithful and animalistic African-American men).  Was it possible that a white man could really capture the essence of this amazing novel written by a young African American woman?  Yes, it was more than possible!  In fact, in my eyes, human suffering knows no color line.  I believe Steven Speilberg tapped into his close knowledge of hardship that is rooted in his identity as a Jewish American man.The whole cast was just marvelous!  This was Whoopi Goldberg's film debut as Celie, a young African-American girl growing up in unthinkable circumstances in the South.  Oprah Winfrey also lends her talents as Sofia, a fearless, dignified woman who teaches Celie the importance of self respect at all costs.  Those of you who haven't seen Danny Glover in anything except Leathal Weapon will perhaps be shocked at his turn as the abusive ""Mister"" who marries Celie and then proceeds to beat her, cheat on  her and treat her with less respect than the dirt under his shoe.It is important that EVERYONE see this film.  Though, I don't reccomend under the age of fourteen seeing it because of graphic depictions of domestic violence, psychological, emotional and sexual abuse and thematic intensity.  I thank Alice Walker for having the courage and the strength to write this novel.  I also thank Steven Speilberg, all of the actors and actresses and Quincy Jones for adding his masterful soundtrack to this film.  This is truly incomparable to ANY other film.

Those looking for a faithful adapatation of the novel won't find it here. The characters and much of the dialogue are right out of the book but take on new form. The film needs to be appreciated for what it is: an adaptation.  For the true powerful story of Celie and her sister Nettie, the novel is hard to beat.That said, Spielberg uses good visuals for the film, and the acting is uniformly good. The actors who played Harpo and Shug seemed to have vanished from memory but Goldberg, Glover and Winfrey are very strong.One note: I could have used a little restraint on the score.  Every scene is punctuated by background music and silence would have been more effective. The score just increases the story to un-Walkerlike melodramatic proportions. The key to the story is that Celie's story is small but in the end, is about life in its entirety.  We are so front and center with Celie to begin with that we know that there will be some bombastic finish.

It focuses on women especially black American women who often suffer a lot of hardships and oppression.This skilfully crafted film is a tribute to the artistic and exceptional writing skills of Alice Walker, the author of the book with the same title, and the movie making genius of Steven Speilberg. This is a heartbreaking film about Alice Walker's autobiography, which feature, among other things, how she got separated from her sister who was very close to her, how she endured a loveless arranged marriage to a man who often beat her and how her character eventually developed and she underwent self-discovery.The actors were wonderful and they perfomed their roles exceptionally well. These include Whoopi Goldberg who plays the shy and abused Celie, Oprah Winfrey who plays the strong, no nonsense Sophia, Margaret Aver as the gifted singer Shug Avery, Danny Glover as the abusive husband to Celie who goes to the extent of not allowing Celie to have any contact with her sister Nettie, among others.This is a classic film of all time and one of the best that I have ever seen. It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards but did not get any but has endured over the years, perhaps because of its profound underlying theme on the abusive relationships with which many people relate to.",5,Moving and Beautiful Film,1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,1356,"['Color', 'Purple', 'moving', 'beautiful', 'film', 'well', 'made', 'women', 'especially', 'black', 'American', 'women', 'who', 'often', 'suffer', 'lot', 'hardships', 'skilfully', 'crafted', 'film', 'tribute', 'artistic', 'exceptional', 'writing', 'skills', 'Alice', 'Walker', 'author', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'movie', 'making', 'genius', 'Steven', 'Speilberg', 'heartbreaking', 'film', 'Alice', 'Walker', 'autobiography', 'feature', 'other', 'things', 'how', 'got', 'separated', 'sister', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'close', 'how', 'endured', 'loveless', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'man', 'who', 'often', 'beat', 'how', 'character', 'eventually', 'developed', 'underwent', 'self-discovery.The', 'actors', 'were', 'wonderful', 'perfomed', 'roles', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'include', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'who', 'shy', 'abused', 'Celie', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'who', 'strong', 'nonsense', 'Sophia', 'Margaret', 'Aver', 'gifted', 'singer', 'Shug', 'Avery', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'abusive', 'husband', 'Celie', 'who', 'extent', 'not', 'allowing', 'Celie', 'have', 'contact', 'sister', 'Nettie', 'others.This', 'classic', 'film', 'time', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'nominated', '11', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'endured', 'years', 'perhaps', 'profound', 'underlying', 'theme', 'abusive', 'relationships', 'many', 'people', 'relate']",N/A

In fact, it was the very first DVD I purchased and if you don't own one of these machines, GET ONE!  It's like  seeing the movie for the first time all over again when you compare DVD to  VHS. Though the disc itself may not be &quot;reference&quot; quality, the  movie is.Sit down for a rollercoaster of emotions and throw away all  barriers of color because once you get involved with the characters, they  all vanish.  It covers both issues of race and of abuse concerning black  women during the turn of the century and how so often they were bought as  wives, but more often as servents within their own house.  The storyline is  timeless and it DOES have a Very Happy ending!  People cheered for Celie in  the theatres as she comes out on top.Each and every one of the actors  were virtual &quot;unknows&quot; at the time (that is the way Spielberg  wanted it) and this is the vehicle that help launched their careers. Yet it  is a sad state of affairs that this highly nominated movie and its actors  never won an Oscar that was so well deserved because of the controversial  theme.  Hollywood had second thoughts when everyone protested but all too  late.Others have written an adequate synopsis of the movie's content so  I will let you read those elsewhere, but take it from me, a person hard to  please and usually watch and purchase FX movies, this is one you will want  to own and make a tradition to watch over and over again, side-by-side with  &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.  It will tug at both men and women's heart  strings alike!Also, as of this date, there is plans for a reissue  &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD this year.

Taylor ""GFT""","[6, 14]","Director Steven Spielberg has the very nasty habit of undertaking deep subjects and then trivializing them with a simpering sentimentality more appropriate to a second-rate Walt Disney film than the actual subject at hand.  To make matters worse, with THE COLOR PURPLE he also dumbs-down Alice Walker's brilliantly story of a depression-era black lesbian's slow and painful spiritual journey toward self-knowledge, removing as much as he dare from the story lest it offend the middle-class audience at which this film is very clearly aimed.Fortunately, THE COLOR PURPLE is remarkably blessed in its cast. Whoopi Goldberg's performance is a revelation of unexpected artistic depth, touching, funny, tough, and entirely honesty. Ophra Winfrey and Margaret Avrey are equally fine in complex supporting roles, and Hollywood's failure to make successful use of these actresses following their appearance in this film says quite a lot about the down-side of corporate film making.  The power of Goldberg, Winfrey, and Avery--as well as every one in the entire cast--is such that the performers largely transcend Spielberg's ham-heavy touch to make the film memorable. The art direction is merely so-so, and I'd be willing to bet that neither Spielberg nor any of his designers actually bothered to visit the rural deep south before designing the show; the resulting look of the film is very hit and miss where autheticity is concerned.  On the other hand, the cinematography is exceptionally fine and deserves a great deal of credit for making the film as enjoyable as it is.  The script, as noted, is essentially a very weak adaptation of the novel, touching on but inevitably ducking the issues which made the novel so interesting.  The Quincy Jones score, however, is stunning and deserves every one of the accolades heaped upon it.Watch this movie for the deeply moving performances, cinematography, and score. Then go out and buy the book.  And if you've neither read the book nor seen the film, for heaven's sake DON'T read the book until you've seen the film: seeing the movie won't spoil book, but reading the book will certainly make you even more acutely aware of the film's already obvious failings.",3,Stunning performances makes film worth effort,1010102400,"01 4, 2002",2002,2204,"['Director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'very', 'nasty', 'habit', 'undertaking', 'deep', 'subjects', 'then', 'trivializing', 'simpering', 'sentimentality', 'more', 'appropriate', 'second-rate', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'film', 'actual', 'subject', 'hand', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'THE', 'COLOR', 'PURPLE', 'also', 'dumbs-down', 'Alice', 'Walker', 'brilliantly', 'story', 'depression-era', 'black', 'lesbian', 'slow', 'painful', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'self-knowledge', 'removing', 'as', 'much', 'story', 'offend', 'middle-class', 'audience', 'film', 'very', 'clearly', 'aimed.Fortunately', 'THE', 'COLOR', 'PURPLE', 'remarkably', 'blessed', 'cast', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'performance', 'revelation', 'unexpected', 'artistic', 'depth', 'touching', 'funny', 'tough', 'entirely', 'honesty', 'Ophra', 'Winfrey', 'Margaret', 'Avrey', 'are', 'equally', 'fine', 'complex', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Hollywood', 'failure', 'make', 'successful', 'use', 'actresses', 'following', 'appearance', 'film', 'quite', 'lot', 'down-side', 'corporate', 'film', 'making', 'power', 'Goldberg', 'Winfrey', 'Avery', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'entire', 'cast', 'such', 'performers', 'largely', 'transcend', 'Spielberg', 'ham-heavy', 'touch', 'make', 'film', 'memorable', 'art', 'direction', 'merely', 'so-so', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'bet', 'Spielberg', 'designers', 'actually', 'bothered', 'visit', 'rural', 'deep', 'south', 'designing', 'show', 'resulting', 'look', 'film', 'very', 'hit', 'miss', 'where', 'autheticity', 'concerned', 'other', 'hand', 'cinematography', 'exceptionally', 'fine', 'great', 'deal', 'credit', 'making', 'film', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'script', 'noted', 'essentially', 'very', 'weak', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'touching', 'inevitably', 'ducking', 'issues', 'made', 'novel', 'so', 'interesting', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'score', 'however', 'stunning', 'deserves', 'one', 'accolades', 'heaped', 'it.Watch', 'movie', 'deeply', 'moving', 'performances', 'cinematography', 'score', 'Then', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'book', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'film', 'heaven', 'sake', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'read', 'book', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'seeing', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'book', 'reading', 'book', 'will', 'certainly', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'acutely', 'aware', 'film', 'already', 'obvious', 'failings']",N/A

It is rare to find a film that does not shock you out of its world at some point.One of the things I appreciate the most is the transfer. Most films are transfered to video/DVD without the direction of the cinematographer. This quick, cheap process ends up with a film that loses its original brilliance.

I saw the movie because I like Mr. Spielberg's films (except ""JAWS"" and the last ""Indiana Jones"" movie) and Danny Glover. the movie is ""Oliver Twist Or The Parish Boy's Progress,"" only done badly for colored people. (Why doesn't Oprah appear in more movies?) I read somewhere that Mr. Spielberg now regrets not showing the lesbian relationship between Celie & Shug (was the author of the novel on crack when she wrote the book?; only a drug addict would insert an abomination like that [ie. same-sex relationship] in a book, play or movie). I feel completely let down by this awful movie. Having never read the book (nor do i intend to; had Walker not inserted a same-sex relationship into the book, i definitely would read it; i made that mistake with ""The Picture Of Dorian Gray,"" buying it and not even knowing that the main character is a freak), this movie is a complete waste of time. I SO DO NOT recommend it. Whoopi Goldberg is also UGLY and not even a good actress. I really liked the scene where Mister tears Celie away from Nettie (I think it should have been more brutal, though; somethng along the lines of Mister bashing Nettie's head in with a rock or breaking her arm or fingers). And as much as I liked Oprah's character in the movie, I think the townspeople should have lynched her for punching the white lady (last time I checked, insubordination to a white person was punishable by either prison or lynching at the time the movie is set). also, the bits with Harpo falling were hilarious. Oprah's a much better actress (and better-looking) than Goldberg. DO NOT waste your money on this garbage. and why was it even called ""The Color Purple""? the color had NOTHING to do with this awful movie. real let-down. plus, i felt the movie was overly long and too melodramatic. i like drama movies, but this film is something i can't even type here. I can give you an idea, though: it's what you do in the bathroom (ie. a number 2) and what was that ""Ma-kee-da-da"" crap suppossed to mean, anyway?I have to refute an outrageous comment that some nutcase made on this review. ""Oliver Twist Or The Parish Boy's Progress"" is one of my favourite books. I've read it numerous times. From viewing this awful melodramatic mess, it was clear to me that this film is ""Oliver Twist"" written by a colored person for colored people, and it's atrocious.

She is one of those Afro-American women who deserves all our love and adoration. She explores in this film, and behind it in the book, the slow and progressive liberation of black women from their ancillary slavery. It must all start in their heads. They must find the courage to develop their own personalities and freedom in the closed jail of their skulls, and then, little by little they find the strength and the power to resist men, and then society, and then to excell. Liberatiion is a mental process that finds its total power when it gets public and looks at society as the natural field of its realization. The film is touching, poignant, sensitive, intelligent, sentimental and tremendously potent, if not even pregnant with the most universal language we can imagine, the language of the liberation of women seen as the first step of the liberation of humanity. Alice Walker is universal in this story and she deals with the whole world, and with every single human being. What's more, no one is lost, no one is abandoned on the side of the road, no one is forever wasted to the cause of liberation. Even the worst tyrant will find in his or her moral depth the idea and the initiative that will make him or her free along with the others, along with those he or she has ensalved for decades. The husband pays for the immigration of his wife's sister's own African husband and family. And he does it for nothing at all, because he stays on the side and does not claim his due.

Another classic that I have seen numerous times and also own. The opening scene of two sisters in a field of purple flowers to the African savanna to the rolling fields of Georgia, this film is almost tangible. The character development is intriguing. I loved watching Celie on her road of self-discovery, and the people she met along the way.There is not a movie in this whole world that moved me more than ""The Color Purple"". It is an instant classic. Spielberg made great character developments and characteristics. The women of the movie were absolutely UNFORGETTABLE. Whoopi Goldberg gives the performance of the lifetime as the shy, abused, and mistreated Celie. This is the finest screen debut ever!! Oprah Winfrey was heartbreaking as the strong Sophia. Margaret Avery gives an outstanding dramatic and musical performance as the singer Shug Avery, who was only one of the few people that cared about Celie. These 3 women were all nominated for an Academy Award for these performances. With a combination of Steven Spielberg, Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover, and Oprah Winfrey, how can you lose?

What the film so adeptly demonstrates is the very harsh realities that far too many women (black  women in particular) have had to endure for far too long in a male  dominated society.  The strength of all of the female characters is  indominatable.  That being said we should not forget how important racism  was in creating the attitudes of black males then as today.  That doesn't  excuse the behavior nor eliminate the responsibility for the acts but it  does however help to explain them.Spielberg's direction is better (in  my opinion) in this film than in any other film of his career (Schindler's  List) included.  For him not to have received the Oscar as best director  and for this film to have been denied the Best Picture award is one of many  great injustices perpertrated by the ... hollywood establishment.  The most  dramatic (not emotional mind you) scene in the movie is when Celie is  getting ready to shave Mister at the same time as her son is undertaking  his ritual and Shug has intuition about Celie's murderous intent.  Absolutely flawless.  The music was perfect as it built in  intensity.You'll laugh, cry, think and be entertained.  What more could  you ask for.Whoopi Goldberg is one of the best dramatic actresses I  think i've ever seen.  The same can't be said for her less than comedic  talents.

92517,A245FDGAV2C3KW,0790729717,Jonathan Musere,"[4, 5]","""The Color Purple,"" involves struggles of women to achieve recognition as individuals deserving of fair and equal treatment, in face of male dominance. Both the book and the movie, of the same title, shed light on feminist issues.The male dominance is in various forms and includes physical aggressiveness. Albert (Mr.) adamantly declares to Celie, ""Men spose to wear the pants"" (1982: 272).The narrator conveys by way of letters from one person (Celie) to another, the epistolary form. The feminist level of stance is powerful in the novel. Celie struggles to find peace and establish her worthiness. She was abused and raped by her ""father,"" she was dispossessed of her infant children, she is forced to marry Albert (Mr___) who she does not want, she loses her sister Nettie because of her adulterous husband's sexual aggressiveness and philandering.Women are heavily exploited, more so Celie who in the marriage is made to look after Albert's offspring, to toil on the farm, and to submit to all of Albert's demands and those of his offspring. Celie writes, ""Mr...marry me to take care of his children. I marry him cause my daddy made me. I don't love Mr___and he don't love me"" (1982: 64). Celie is also required to accept Albert's affair with Shug Avery, which goes as far as Albert sleeping with Shug under the same roof with his wife. The book dramatically displays how female inequality is rampant. The preacher condemns and attacks Shug for her looseness, whereas Albert's wanton infidelity is tolerated. Celie's sex with Albert is unloving and vile, Celie expresses of Albert, ""Just to do his business, get off, go to sleep"" (1982: 78). Shug says to Celie, ""You make it sound like he going the toilet on you"" (1982: 78). Mary Agnes solicits a white uncle to help get Sofia out of prison, the uncle rapes her. Albert attempts to force Nettie (Celie's sister) to submit to him, but she leaves after successfully fighting him off. Physical violence against the women is common, apparently even in relationships of lovingness, such as that between Harpo and his wife Sofia. Harpo beats Sofia because, as he says, ""The wife s'pose to mind"" (1982: 64). Harpo even considers it respectable to physically violate his wife.The narrator conveys the message that woman must full-fledgedly oppose the treatment of unfairness meted on them by men, and that they should achieve this through uniting and helping each other. The women in the novel, often converge in taking a feminist stance. They band together to hold each other up in support and sustenance, even those with interest in the same men. Feminist bonds of sisterhood are borne out as important, these we see in Nettie and Celie, in Sophia and Odessa, even in Mary Agnes and Sofia, in Albert's sister and Celie. in Tashi and Olivia, and in Shug Avery and Celie. The latter, in their relationship, encapsulate the twin roles of sisters and lovers.Some of the women, such as Sofia adapt to fighting for and defending themselves. Sofia is of strong character, she is not subservient, she is powerful and physically strong. She can be quite aggressive but this spills into a dreadful experience at the hands of the police after she had the nerve to talk back to the white mayor. Subsequently, Sofia is sentenced to be the mayor's servant; doing dull, irksome, and fatiguing work for many years. The sisterhood feminist bond between Sofia and Mary Agnes is stronger than their mutual interest of affection for Harpo. Mary goes as far as enduring rape on behalf of attempting to get Sofia released. And when Mary Agnes goes off to pursue a singing career, it is Sophia who looks after her child.The most feminist liberated and independent-thinking woman, of them all, is Shug Avery; despite the verbal attacks meted on her by church elders because of her lifestyle. She is a career blues singer, an occupation that offers her much more freedom than the others who are under the confines of home, housework and bringing up children. Shug's stance on sexual freedom is stronger than that of many other women, she has numerous affairs while enjoying her sexuality without restraint and guilt. Her feminist strength still involves her strong belief in God, she does not worship or believe in the conventional way. Indeed it is the relationship between Shug and Celie that is the central theme in the novel. Shug will liberate Celie in numerous aspects of her life. Shug simultaneously becomes a sister, friend and lover to Celie as she guides her into emotional and financial independence. Shug's feminist stance stands out. Her gender and opinions do not preclude her from being humanly equal to everybody and possessing the integrity. She passes these qualities onto Celie. Paradoxically, it is the occupation of sewing, ""a woman's job,"" that significantly gains Celie independence--but the product is trousers, to be worn by women. Celie becomes strong enough to point out to Albert that the qualities of honesty, integrity, and independence are valid for both genders. Celie criticizes Albert's contention that, ""...Shug act more manly than most men. I mean she upright, honest. Speak her mind and the devil take the hindmost. You know Shug will fight...Just like Sophia. She bound to live her life and be herself no matter what"" (1982: 270). This exemplifies addressing the issues of feminine and masculine temperament in the novel. The novel asserts that women, as people can be just as weak and strong as men, therefore gender should never be a yardstick for perceptions of human qualities.The book is a complex weaving of events in a woman's life that are hard to completely represent in a movie. Nevertheless, the movie maintains most of the heartbreaking issues which mirror the hardships that happened in the author's life. Whoopi Goldberg artfully plays the shy and abused Celie, Oprah Winfrey is powerful as the strong and no-nonsense Sophia, Margaret Avery is the gifted and independent singer Shug Avery, and Danny Glover is the abusive husband who disallows Celie having contact with Nettie and others. The issues that were toned down or understated in this movie, such as the lesbian loving and the violence, would probably be more graphically played during this era. That was 1985, not that long ago, but film-makers were less blunt with their images. The ""lesbian"" (the word is not mentioned in the book) acts are not conceived as being lesbian at all, but as a means (for Shug) to show Celie that a person can be loved and not just used as a toilet for sex. Compared to the book the movie rendition can sometimes appear to be too glamorous, too glorified, and too sweet. Director Spielberg commendably images the brutality of a rape by showing hanging leather belts banging against the head of the shaking bed.The actors performed their roles exceptionally well. These include Whoopi Goldberg who plays the shy and abused Celie, Oprah Winfrey who plays the strong, no nonsense Sophia, Margaret Aver as the gifted singer Shug Avery, Danny Glover as the abusive husband to Celie who goes to the extent of not allowing Celie to have any contact with her sister Nettie, among others. The movie depicts the female characters as generally good persons, not flawless. The women are of unique backgrounds, conditions and talents, and they weave together to help each other out, in feminism strength. The men are generally likeable, save for abusive Danny Glover (who, anyway, later redeems himself); so it is difficult to look at the movie and the book as an attack on black masculinity in the course of displaying black (or overall) feminist strength. Consider that Rev. Samuel the missionary adopts Celie's children; Buster the boxer dates and does not try to overrule the strong-willed Sophia; even Shug's husband, Grady (in the movie version) accepts Shug for who she is, despite knowing her past of licentiousness.Both the book and movie turn out to be amongst the most powerful in addressing issues of feminism in everyday life. Alice Walker prevalently employs black English and black characters, but this is a book and movie that almost anyone, near and far, can relate to. The book offers much more in that sphere than the movie, but both declare that triumph in a woman's life often happens when misfortune and adversity are challenged by feminist unity and forthrightness in face of a male dominated world. Women's issues come in various shapes and sizes, as the book and movie illustrate, but strength is indeed in numbers, ambitiousness, education, and becoming outward looking other than insular. A woman is to significantly love and cherish herself, get rid of the oppression blocking her, before she can fully appreciate and enjoy herself as well as others.",5,Issues of Feminism,1190246400,"09

92518,AD9WTAOAFUZA4,0790729717,"Jose R. Perez ""Jose""","[8, 8]","By turns devastating and uplifting, Steve Spielberg's adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is one of those rare films that effectively captures and builds on the book's underlying themes and moods.  Epic and grand in its exectution, ""The Color Purple"" is accessible to viewers of any race and is no more an ""african-american"" film than ""Gone With the Wind"" was a ""southern"" film.  The themes presented here - tolerance, integration, poverty, aspiration and assimilation - are universal and real and Spielberg delivers a potent mix of superb film technique, a well-crafted plot and simply said, breakthtakingly heartfelt performances from an all-star cast.Whoopie Goldberg earned an Oscar nod for her amazing performance as Celie, literally transforming herself from the stand-up comedienne we all know and love into a sensitive woman-child whose life is a mix of tragedy and triumph.  Margaret Avery and Oprah Winfrey are bookends in Celie's life - they embody their characters fully and in doing so, complete a triad of powerful women coping with fear, loss and repression that testify to the unique challenges women, and especially women of color, face even today.  Very few films deserve to be classified as required viewing for all - ""Schindler's List"" ""Birth of a Nation"" are two that come to mind - and ""The Color Purple"" is one of them.  Filled with raw dramatic power and awe-inspiring humanity, ""The Color Purple"" is a film for the ages.

The last time that I had watched this film it was on some old crummy VHS tape, you know .. the ones with the scratchy video lines scrolling from top to bottom every 15 minutes, and in a crowded room of people at that. It's really nice at this age to sit down and enjoy one of Spielberg's greatest stories brought to such a high quality DVD.The Color Purple is a 1982 epistolary novel by American author Alice Walker which won the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the National Book Award for Fiction. It was later adapted into a film and musical of the same name.Taking place mostly in rural Georgia, the story focuses on the life of women of color in the southern United States in the 1930s, addressing numerous issues including their exceedingly low position in American social culture. The novel has been the frequent target of censors and appears on the American Library Association list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 2000-2009 at number seventeen because of the sometimes explicit content, particularly in terms of violence.Celie, the protagonist and narrator, is a poor, uneducated, fourteen-year-old black girl living in the South. She starts writing letters to God because her father, Alphonso, beats and rapes her. Alphonso has already impregnated Celie once. Celie gave birth to a girl, whom her father presumably killed in the woods. Celie has a second child, a boy, whom her father also abducts. Celie's mother becomes ill and dies. Alphonso brings home a new wife, and continues to abuse Celie.Celie and her bright, pretty younger sister, Nettie, learn that a man known only as Mr.___ wants to marry Nettie. Mr.___ has a mistress named Shug Avery, a sultry lounge singer whose photograph fascinates Celie. Alphonso refuses to let Nettie marry, and instead offers Mr.___ Celie, who he refers to as ugly, as his bride. Mr.___ eventually accepts the offer, forcing Celie into a difficult and abusive marriage. Nettie runs away from Alphonso and takes refuge at Celie's house. Mr.___ still desires Nettie, and when he advances on her, she leaves. Promising to write, Celie assumes her silence means her death ( "" 'Nothing but death can keep me from it' she never write"")Mr.___'s sister Kate feels sorry for Celie, and tells her to fight back against Mr.___ rather than submit to his abuses. Harpo, Mr.___'s son, falls in love with a large, spunky girl named Sofia. Shug Avery comes to town to sing at a local bar, but Celie is not allowed to go see her. Sofia gets pregnant and marries Harpo. Celie is amazed by Sofia's defiance in the face of Harpo's and Mr.___'s attempts to treat Sofia as an inferior. Harpo, kinder and gentler than his father, still assumes this means he is doing something wrong and under the advice of Mr.___ and a momentarily jealous Celie, attempts to beat Sofia into submission. Unlike Celie, however, Sofia fights back.Shug falls ill and Mr.___ takes her into his house. Shug is initially rude to Celie (""You show is ugly""), but the two women become friends as Celie takes charge of nursing Shug. Celie finds herself infatuated with Shug and attracted to her sexually.Frustrated by Harpo's consistent attempts to subordinate her, Sofia moves out, taking her children with her. Several months later, Harpo opens a juke joint where Shug sings nightly. Celie grows confused over her feelings toward Shug.Shug decides to stay when she learns that Mr.___ beats Celie when Shug is away. Shug and Celie's relationship grows intimate, and Shug begins to ask Celie questions about sex. Sofia returns for a visit and promptly gets in a fight with Harpo's new girlfriend, Squeak. In town one day, the mayor's wife, Miss Millie, asks Sofia to work as her maid. Sofia replies with a sassy ""Hell no!"" When the mayor slaps Sofia for her ""insubordination"", Sofia returns the blow, knocking the mayor down, for which she is sent to jail. Squeak's attempts to get Sofia released are futile, resulting in her being raped. Sofia is sentenced to work for 12 years as the mayor's maid, though she is eventually released from jail six months early.Despite her new marriage, at Shug's return visit, she instigates a sexual relationship with Celie, and the two frequently share the same bed. One night Shug asks Celie about her sister and Celie tells her she assumes Nettie is dead because she'd promised to write Celie but never did. Shug helps Celie recover letters from Nettie that Mr.___ has been hiding from her for decades. Overcome with emotion, Celie reads the letters in order, wondering how to keep herself from killing Mr.___.The letters indicate that Nettie befriended a missionary couple, Samuel and Corrine, and accompanied them to Africa to do ministry work. Samuel and Corrine have two adopted children, Olivia and Adam, the two children Celie believed dead. Nettie and Corrine have become close friends, but Corrine, noticing that her adopted children resemble Nettie, wonders if Nettie and Samuel have a secret past. Increasingly suspicious, Corrine tries to limit Nettie's role within her family.Nettie becomes disillusioned with her missionary experience, as she finds the Africans self-centered and obstinate. Corrine becomes ill with a fever. Nettie asks Samuel to tell her how he adopted Olivia and Adam. Based on Samuel's story, Nettie realizes that the two children are actually Celie's biological children (whom Alphonso, her stepfather, abducted), alive after all. Nettie also learns that Alphonso is actually only Nettie and Celie's stepfather, not their biological father, who was a store owner whom white men lynched because they resented his success. Alphonso told Celie and Nettie he was their real father because he wanted to inherit the house and property that was once their mother's.Nettie confesses to Samuel and Corrine that she is in fact their children's biological aunt. The gravely ill Corrine refuses to believe Nettie. Later, Corrine dies, finally having accepted Nettie's story and reconciled thereto just before her death. Meanwhile, Celie visits Alphonso, who confirms Nettie's story, admitting that he is only the sisters' stepfather. Celie begins to lose some of her faith in God, but Shug explains to her a new view of the Divine, one which places Celie within a loved creation. ""God love everything you love, and a whole mess of stuff you don't"". 'I think it pisses God off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere, and don't notice it' 'What it do when it pissed off?' 'I don't know. Make something else, I guess. People think pleasing God is all God cares about, but any fool living can see it always trying to please us back.""Realizing that Mr.___ has hidden Nettie's loving letters from her, and beginning to re imagine herself in the new view of God and of creation that Shug has taught her, she decides to leave Mr.___ with Shug and Squeak, leaving a 'curse' behind her on Mr.___ ""Everything you done to me, already done to you...every lick you hit me you will suffer twice"" and finally asserts her own dignity as a human being against the abuses she has suffered ""I'm poor, black, I may be ugly and I can't cook but I'm here.""At this point, the letters change from being addressed to God, to being addressed to Nettie. She also begins to 'sign off' the letters with Amen.The entire movie in my opinion is just incredible, and I can't thank you enough.Keepsake!",5,A TRUE MASTERPIECE,1379462400,"09 18,

92525,A6ADO7B6FUVN,0790729717,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[1, 2]","The Color Puple is the disturbing story of Celie's (Whoopi Goldberg) life and search for love and happiness in an existence where her she is taught that she is less than others by those who are suppose to love her.  The story begins with Celie giving birth to a baby boy, the result of her fathers incestuous abuse, and she is forced to give the child up on the fathers demand.  Celie is then given away to Albert (Danny Glover), who is much older than her, to be his wife and to take care of his children from a previous marriage.  Shortly thereafter, Celie's sister arrives at Albert's house and Albert begins to act on his attraction to Celie's sister.  However, she fights back and Celie is once again separated from her beloved sister.  Years later, Albert's son Harpo is marrying Sofia (Oprah Winfrey) and when Harpo asks Celie what to do about Sofia's head strong behavior she only knows one answer, beat her.

Color Purple is a traumatizing cinematic experience where the life of Celie is displayed on the screen as brutal search for what all humans need in their life, love.

92536,A3AYDEWU1EPF15,0790729717,Luis Hernandez,"[0, 1]","&quot;The Color Purple&quot; ranks as one of the saddest films in the entire history of cinema. Directed by legendary director &quot;Steven Spielberg,&quot; this was the film that marked the film debuts of some of today's most notable African-American celebrities, notably Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey.While many felt that Spielberg shouldn't have been selected to direct this tale of life in the South because of his religion and California upbringing, Mr. Spielberg's work stands as one of the best films of the 1980's. His style and sensibility to the novel's characters and actions gave him the respect that he deserved and dispelled his critics. A pioneer, Mr. Spielberg refused to edit out the lesbian kiss that Shug (Margaret Avery) and Celie (Whoopi Goldberg) share towards the middle of the film. Keeping true to Alice Walker's original vision, Mr. Spielberg's decision to keep the scene was a breakthrough for gay characters and plots in today's cinema.This film will make anyone cry, and I can't watch the final scene where Celie's happiness to see her loved ones after so many years is so intense without crying. Whoopi's performance in this film can't ever be repeated, especially after she went the comedy route in her later films. It was her first film performance and it was her best.Oprah Winfrey's performance is also one of the most stirring. The scene where she is beaten unconsciously by an angry white mob is both disturbing and tragic, and her physical state after being released from prison will break your heart. Danny Glover is truly amazing as Celie's abusive husband, and so is Margaret Avery as Shug. I find it so upsetting that Rae Dawn Chong was given credit in the cast list seeing that her appearance in the film was one of the shortest in the film (at most only 12 minutes out of 2 hours). I guess the producers felt that Chong's name would attract more filmgoers, especially after the success of her film &quot;Soul Man&quot;.Quincy Jones gospel and African-inspired score is one of the best scores in the past ten years. The scenes where we are transported to Africa to see a sacrifice will keep your suspense up, as well as the gospel performance at the end where Shug reconciles with her father at the church.Overall this is one of the greatest films to be ever made. It represents the life so many African-Americans had to go through after Reconstruction and during the Great Depression. If you must see a film of the African-American experience in the Deep South, this is it. &quot;The Color Purple&quot; is a film gem for all times.",5,Saddest Film I've Ever Seen,974419200,"11 17, 2000",2000,2578,"['quot', 'Color', 'Purple', 'quot', 'one', 'saddest', 'films', 'entire', 'history', 'cinema', 'Directed', 'legendary', 'director', 'quot', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'quot', 'was', 'film', 'marked', 'film', 'debuts', 'today', 'most', 'notable', 'African-American', 'celebrities', 'notably', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey.While', 'many', 'felt', 'Spielberg', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'selected', 'direct', 'tale', 'life', 'South', 'religion', 'California', 'upbringing', 'Mr.', 'Spielberg', 'work', 'one', 'best', 'films', '1980', 'style', 'sensibility', 'novel', 'characters', 'actions', 'gave', 'respect', 'deserved', 'dispelled', 'critics', 'pioneer', 'Mr.', 'Spielberg', 'refused', 'edit', 'out', 'lesbian', 'kiss', 'Shug', 'Margaret', 'Avery', 'Celie', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'share', 'middle', 'film', 'Keeping', 'true', 'Alice', 'Walker', 'original', 'vision', 'Mr.', 'Spielberg', 'decision', 'keep', 'scene', 'was', 'breakthrough', 'gay', 'characters', 'plots', 'today', 'cinema.This', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'anyone', 'cry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'Celie', 'happiness', 'see', 'loved', 'ones', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'so', 'intense', 'crying', 'Whoopi', 'performance', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ever', 'be', 'repeated', 'especially', 'went', 'comedy', 'route', 'later', 'films', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'performance', 'was', 'best.Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'performance', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'stirring', 'scene', 'where', 'beaten', 'unconsciously', 'angry', 'white', 'mob', 'disturbing', 'tragic', 'physical', 'state', 'being', 'released', 'prison', 'will', 'break', 'heart', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'truly', 'amazing', 'Celie', 'abusive', 'husband', 'so', 'Margaret', 'Avery', 'Shug', 'find', 'so', 'upsetting', 'Rae', 'Dawn', 'Chong', 'was', 'given', 'credit', 'cast', 'list', 'seeing', 'appearance', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'shortest', 'film', 'most', 'only', '12', 'minutes', '2', 'hours', 'guess', 'producers', 'felt', 'Chong', 'name', 'would', 'attract', 'more', 'filmgoers', 'especially', 'success', 'film', 'quot', 'Soul', 'Man', 'quot', '.Quincy', 'Jones', 'gospel', 'African-inspired', 'score', 'one', 'best', 'scores', 'past', 'ten', 'years', 'scenes', 'where', 'are', 'transported', 'Africa', 'see', 'sacrifice', 'will', 'keep', 'suspense', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'gospel', 'performance', 'end', 'where', 'Shug', 'father', 'church.Overall', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'be', 'ever', 'made', 'life', 'so', 'many', 'African-Americans', 'had', 'go', 'Reconstruction', 'Great', 'Depression', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'African-American', 'experience', 'Deep', 'South', 'quot', 'Color', 'Purple', 'quot', 'film', 'gem', 'times']",N/A

92539,A3FR2XTU42Y7M9,0790729717,Marcell Orosz,"[6, 7]","This is my #2 movie of all time and I think Steven Spielberg did a great job with this one. I've got a little story to tell before I get into my review (warning: there are spoilers in the review!), here it is:I have to tell you that the first time I saw The Color Purple I didn't even know that this movie existed, I've never heard anything about it before and I didn't know that it was directed by Spielberg. I missed the first 10 minutes of the movie so I couldn't realize till the very end that what I saw was a Spielberg movie. I can still recall the day I saw it: it was a dark November day, I was in a depressed mood and didn't want to do anything. I sat at home watching TV and at about 11 P.M I switched to HBO and from then on I couldn't stand up for one single minute, I was captivated by this movie. There aren't many movies that make me cry like a 5-year-old but The Color Purple made me cry and makes me cry every time I watch it again.The movie is based on Alice Walker's Pulitzer Price winning novel and I think it gets the feeling of it and moves it onto the movie/TV screen. The movie is the story of four women. The main character is Celie (Whoopi Goldberg), an African American woman who is mistreated by her father (raped twice - with 2 children from the incest, none of them living with her), separated from her family (if we can call it that) and married to a brutal man she calls Mr. (Danny Glover). Her only friend in the world is her sister, Nettie (Akosua Busia) who runs to Celie and Mr. when their father tries to rape her as well and after an accident the sisters are separated. Celie lives with Mr. who has a mistress called Shug Avery (Margaret Avery). Shug is a blues singer who stops by many times and is the only person whom is loved by Mr. Mr.'s son, Harpo marries a woman called Sofia (Oprah Winfrey) who has very bad tempers that bring her all sorts of trouble throughout the movie. The story is about the seemingly hopeless life of Celie (spanning almost 40 years of her life) and her longing for love, her sister and her children. Her only companions in this sad life are Shug (yes, Shug the mistress!) and Sofia though both have their own problems. In the end, everyone gets what she has to get. There are winners and there are losers.What makes this movie one of the best movies of all time? First of all, the fantastic actors and actresses. Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey give the best performances of their career (though both debutants here). Danny Glover is frightening as the evil Mr. though you can understand him as well and I must admit that he won my sympathy in the end. Margaret Avery simply shines. These are only the main characters but all the other actors are great. Then there is the direction. Spielberg uses special settings and signs to make you understand every movement and every emotion (there are lots of emotions in the movie). Many people think that Schindler's list was the best movie directed by Spielberg. I think this is his moment where everything has its meaning and there isn't a lost second in the 154-minute movie. The director of photography does a great job, too. Back to the emotions. This movie makes you cry out loud at the things that happen to Celie and the other characters while at the same time you understand them and their reasons to act the way they act. In the last 30-something minutes the movie gives you such a turbulence of emotions that you can only sob and sob and sob. And it gives you something more: a catharsis. Few movies give a catharsis nowadays. The movie has some important messages, too. These are old truths but they are true: never give up and when there's little hope you have to hold on and go on with your life. There is sadness, joy, and there is forgiving, too. My favorite line is: ""See, Daddy, sinners have a soul, too.""Why did the movie fail at the Oscars then? I think it is the theme. It is about African American people and the way they were mistreated (by white people and by themselves as well). It is about incest, it is about men beating their wives and it is about many themes that are considered as taboo themes even today. But these things had to be told, this movie had to be made because we were poorer if it didn't exist. The Color Purple should have won all the 11 Academy Awards it was nominated for but it got none.

Matthews,"[11, 11]","Steven Spielberg's first cinematic attempt to delve deeper than escapism produced a rich, heartfelt epic that matched the Pulitzer Prize-winning credentials of Alice Walker's novel, receiving 11 Oscar nominations but famously winning none of them. The Color Purple is a triumph of all elements of production design, nominated for its screenplay, cinematography, makeup, costumes, art direction, score, and three of its actresses - though not for director Spielberg. The snub may have helped push him as an artist toward such prestigious works as Schindler's List. One would hardly guess Whoopi Goldberg's roots were in comedy, given the layered dramatic performance she offers in her first real screen role. Oprah Winfrey (also debuting) and Margaret Avery are the other two-thirds of the heart-breaking dynamic between three black women in Spielberg's brutal world of racial and sexual prejudice. Even Danny Glover's role shows late-blooming sympathy, however agonizingly wrought, which demonstrates the dimension of Menno Meyjes' script. There's nothing simple about this early 20th century South, populated by characters paralyzed by the roles ascribed to them, and wickedly punished when they try to venture beyond their bounds. It boils the blood at the same time that it touches the soul, making for genuinely tear-soaked cinema with a visceral emotional payoff.",5,Strong Overall,1041465600,"01 2, 2003",2003,1368,"['Steven', 'Spielberg', 'first', 'cinematic', 'attempt', 'delve', 'deeper', 'escapism', 'produced', 'rich', 'heartfelt', 'epic', 'matched', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize-winning', 'credentials', 'Alice', 'Walker', 'novel', 'receiving', '11', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'famously', 'winning', 'none', 'Color', 'Purple', 'triumph', 'elements', 'production', 'design', 'nominated', 'screenplay', 'cinematography', 'makeup', 'costumes', 'art', 'direction', 'score', 'three', 'actresses', 'not', 'director', 'Spielberg', 'snub', 'may', 'have', 'helped', 'push', 'artist', 'such', 'prestigious', 'works', 'Schindler', 'List', 'One', 'would', 'hardly', 'guess', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'roots', 'were', 'comedy', 'given', 'layered', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'first', 'real', 'screen', 'role', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'also', 'debuting', 'Margaret', 'Avery', 'are', 'other', 'two-thirds', 'heart-breaking', 'dynamic', 'three', 'black', 'women', 'Spielberg', 'brutal', 'world', 'racial', 'sexual', 'prejudice', 'Even', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'role', 'late-blooming', 'sympathy', 'however', 'agonizingly', 'wrought', 'dimension', 'Menno', 'Meyjes', 'script', 'nothing', 'simple', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'South', 'populated', 'characters', 'paralyzed', 'roles', 'ascribed', 'wickedly', 'punished', 'when', 'try', 'venture', 'bounds', 'blood', 'same', 'time', 'soul', 'making', 'genuinely', 'tear-soaked', 'cinema', 'visceral', 'emotional', 'payoff']",N/A

92578,A12X2J7AVZ04IQ,0790729717,"R. Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[5, 6]","I saw this within the first week of its release, and I was profoundly shaken by its power. Spielberg, after ""E.T."" proved himself as a director to be reckoned with. Too bad the Academy didn't think so. There's little to be known about the plight of rural Black landowners during the depression, so we're relying on Alice Walker's novel as the basis of the riveting narrative of Celie's journey through a remarkable life. I remember protests against the film because of Danny Glover's wonderfully centered mean guy (even though he's the ultimate, sad hero). I've seen nastier people in White-centered films, and Danny's nastiness doesn't even come close. Still, he was deserving of a nomination, showing many layers of a complicated character. I really think this is a women-driven film, since the best characters (and acting) came from the many fine women's roles. Whoopi was certainly wonderful, though she didn't show up until a half hour into the film. Celie's young character, played with wonderful strength and pathos by Desreta Jackson was appealing. Akosua Busia was confident, as was Dana Ivey, in a bit of inspired casting, as the rich white woman, a grand display of idiocy and ignorance. Rae Dawn Chong's character should've been developed more, since she figured significantly in the final outcome. Oprah, of course, was the most memorable character, since she had the showiest role...or did she? I wanna know what happened to Margaret Avery (Shug). To me, she gave the best performance in the film. Trashy, sweet, soft, sensitive...she had to do it all. Her final scene with her father brought tears, her strength of character made Celie the strong character that she became. Her career should've taken off after this film. The women are the driving force in this film, and there's not a weak one in the bunch. Larry Fishburne (Swain) had one of his first roles, and Willard Pugh was delightful as Harpo...and whatever happened to him? I loved Avery the most, but Glover, after a great role the previous year in ""Places in the Heart"", showed great versatility. Overall, this is a film of passion, warmth and emotion. It's always been one of my favorites. The DVD version is lacking in too many ways; I'm sure an anniversary version will be coming out soon. Commentaries would be nice, since most of those involved are still around. I was a bit annoyed that I had to turn the disc over during Celie's most life-affirming scene. There was also protest that this film was nominated for 11 Oscars and won nothing, suggesting anti-Black behavior from the Academy. 8 years earlier, ""The Turning Point"" was also nominated for 11 Oscars and won nothing. As one critic said, ""Does this mean the Academy is anti-tutu?"" The whole argument is silly, and no one can explain why Spielberg won the Directors Guild award though no Oscar nomination...this is a great argument for people to ignore awards and critics. This film is a delight...sad, humorous, insightful...and very powerful. You should see this, and have tissues handy. When Shug hugs her father at the end, the power of the music and the moment can't help but take you away. Then, of course, there's the final moment when Celie sees her kids... Then there's Oprah, snapping out of her funk and announcing that she's home again. See it. Love it. It's worth it.",5,"Stunning, effective and heart-felt...",1042588800,"01 15, 2003",2003,3320,"['saw', 'first', 'week', 'release', 'was', 'profoundly', 'shaken', 'power', 'Spielberg', 'E.T', 'proved', 'director', 'be', 'reckoned', 'Too', 'bad', 'Academy', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'little', 'be', 'known', 'plight', 'rural', 'Black', 'landowners', 'depression', ""'re"", 'relying', 'Alice', 'Walker', 'novel', 'basis', 'riveting', 'narrative', 'Celie', 'journey', 'remarkable', 'life', 'remember', 'protests', 'film', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'wonderfully', 'centered', 'mean', 'guy', 'even', 'ultimate', 'sad', 'hero', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'nastier', 'people', 'White-centered', 'films', 'Danny', 'nastiness', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'Still', 'was', 'deserving', 'nomination', 'showing', 'many', 'layers', 'complicated', 'character', 'really', 'think', 'women-driven', 'film', 'best', 'characters', 'acting', 'came', 'many', 'fine', 'women', 'roles', 'Whoopi', 'was', 'certainly', 'wonderful', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'half', 'hour', 'film', 'Celie', 'young', 'character', 'played', 'wonderful', 'strength', 'pathos', 'Desreta', 'Jackson', 'was', 'appealing', 'Akosua', 'Busia', 'was', 'confident', 'was', 'Dana', 'Ivey', 'bit', 'inspired', 'casting', 'rich', 'white', 'woman', 'grand', 'display', 'idiocy', 'ignorance', 'Rae', 'Dawn', 'Chong', 'character', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'developed', 'more', 'figured', 'significantly', 'final', 'outcome', 'Oprah', 'course', 'was', 'most', 'memorable', 'character', 'had', 'showiest', 'role', 'did', 'wan', 'na', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Margaret', 'Avery', 'Shug', 'gave', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'Trashy', 'sweet', 'soft', 'sensitive', 'had', 'do', 'final', 'scene', 'father', 'brought', 'tears', 'strength', 'character', 'made', 'Celie', 'strong', 'character', 'became', 'career', 'should', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'off', 'film', 'women', 'are', 'driving', 'force', 'film', 'not', 'weak', 'one', 'bunch', 'Larry', 'Fishburne', 'Swain', 'had', 'one', 'first', 'roles', 'Willard', 'Pugh', 'was', 'delightful', 'Harpo', 'happened', 'loved', 'Avery', 'most', 'Glover', 'great', 'role', 'previous', 'year', 'Places', 'Heart', 'showed', 'great', 'versatility', 'Overall', 'film', 'passion', 'warmth', 'emotion', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorites', 'DVD', 'version', 'lacking', 'too', 'many', 'ways', ""'m"", 'sure', 'anniversary', 'version', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'out', 'soon', 'Commentaries', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'most', 'involved', 'are', 'still', 'was', 'bit', 'annoyed', 'had', 'turn', 'disc', 'Celie', 'most', 'life-affirming', 'scene', 'was', 'also', 'protest', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', '11', 'Oscars', 'won', 'nothing', 'suggesting', 'anti-Black', 'behavior', 'Academy', '8', 'years', 'earlier', 'Turning', 'Point', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', '11', 'Oscars', 'won', 'nothing', 'one', 'critic', 'said', 'mean', 'Academy', 'anti-tutu', 'whole', 'argument', 'silly', 'one', 'can', 'explain', 'why', 'Spielberg', 'won', 'Directors', 'Guild', 'award', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'great', 'argument', 'people', 'ignore', 'awards', 'critics', 'film', 'delight', 'sad', 'humorous', 'insightful', 'very', 'powerful', 'should', 'see', 'have', 'tissues', 'handy', 'When', 'Shug', 'father', 'end', 'power', 'music', 'moment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'take', 'away', 'Then', 'course', 'final', 'moment', 'when', 'Celie', 'kids', 'Then', 'Oprah', 'snapping', 'funk', 'announcing', 'home', 'again', 'See', 'Love']",N/A

Jentsch,"[5, 6]","How Does It Look?This movie is 25 years old, so it's not going to have the shine of something brand new, but excellent releases of older movies like Casablanca and The Searchers have shown that a movie doesn't have to look bad just because it's a got a few years on it.A good job has been done transferring this movie from film to Blu-ray. I did not notice any distracting artifacts like excessive edge enhancement or noise reduction, which allows the artistry of the movie to take center stage.How Does it Sound?Since the movie was originally a 2-channel stereo release, the lossless DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack is mostly front-channel. There is very little for the surrounds to do, and one has to purposely get up close and personal with your surround speakers to hear anything at all through most of the movie. While scenes like those in the juke joint could have benefited from some ambience, this movie is first and foremost a story told by the main character, and every part of that story was understandable. Quincy Jones' music also came through very well, and fairly numerous musical numbers are very enjoyable to listen to. There is no evidence that this is a movie that is a quarter-century old!ExtrasThis disc contains three sections of extras in the Special Features menu. There are four behind-the-scenes featurettes, two photo galleries, and three movie trailers. All of the extras appear to be the same as those included on theThe Color Purple (Two-Disc Special Edition)DVD release from 2003, so nothing new was created for this release.ConclusionFor fans of the movie, this title is definitely worth picking up! The transfer is good and the booklet and included extras make for a nice addition to a home video library. Between the movie and all the extras, you can spend more than five hours enjoying all that is offered here, and more if you go back and revisit some scenes after watching the extras.While I'm glad to see Warner Bros. dropping the upfront ads and including the trailers in the extras, the book is the only new extra (and I'm not sure if there were similar materials in the 2003 Special Edition release). The transfer is very good, but it should be, considering that this is a Steven Spielberg movie being released on a milestone anniversary. We have lots of good transfers being released, so putting in some extra effort would sweeten the deal and it would probably push a few fence-sitters into making the purchase.",4,"Good movie, good Blu-ray release, same extras as 2003 Special Edition DVD",1297382400,"02 11, 2011",2011,2453,"['How', 'Look', 'movie', '25', 'years', 'old', 'not', 'going', 'have', 'shine', 'something', 'brand', 'new', 'excellent', 'releases', 'older', 'movies', 'Casablanca', 'Searchers', 'have', 'shown', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'look', 'bad', 'just', 'got', 'few', 'years', 'it.A', 'good', 'job', 'been', 'done', 'transferring', 'movie', 'film', 'Blu-ray', 'did', 'not', 'notice', 'distracting', 'artifacts', 'excessive', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'noise', 'reduction', 'artistry', 'movie', 'take', 'center', 'stage.How', 'Sound', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', '2-channel', 'stereo', 'release', 'lossless', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', 'soundtrack', 'mostly', 'front-channel', 'very', 'little', 'surrounds', 'do', 'one', 'purposely', 'get', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'surround', 'speakers', 'hear', 'anything', 'most', 'movie', 'scenes', 'juke', 'joint', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'ambience', 'movie', 'first', 'foremost', 'story', 'told', 'main', 'character', 'part', 'story', 'was', 'understandable', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'music', 'also', 'came', 'very', 'well', 'fairly', 'numerous', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'listen', 'evidence', 'movie', 'quarter-century', 'old', 'ExtrasThis', 'disc', 'contains', 'three', 'sections', 'extras', 'Special', 'Features', 'menu', 'are', 'four', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'two', 'photo', 'galleries', 'three', 'movie', 'trailers', 'extras', 'appear', 'be', 'same', 'included', 'theThe', 'Color', 'Purple', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'release', '2003', 'so', 'nothing', 'new', 'was', 'created', 'release.ConclusionFor', 'fans', 'movie', 'title', 'definitely', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'transfer', 'good', 'booklet', 'included', 'extras', 'make', 'nice', 'addition', 'home', 'video', 'library', 'movie', 'extras', 'can', 'spend', 'more', 'five', 'hours', 'enjoying', 'offered', 'here', 'more', 'go', 'back', 'revisit', 'scenes', 'watching', 'extras.While', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'dropping', 'upfront', 'ads', 'including', 'trailers', 'extras', 'book', 'only', 'new', 'extra', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'were', 'similar', 'materials', '2003', 'Special', 'Edition', 'release', 'transfer', 'very', 'good', 'should', 'be', 'considering', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'movie', 'being', 'released', 'milestone', 'anniversary', 'have', 'lots', 'good', 'transfers', 'being', 'released', 'so', 'putting', 'extra', 'effort', 'would', 'sweeten', 'deal', 'would', 'probably', 'push', 'few', 'fence-sitters', 'making', 'purchase']",N/A

Everytime I think about all the nominations it got, and the number of awards that it DIDN'T win, I get angry. Too angry, perhaps. It's actually scary how angry I get when I think of it. Anyways, this was THE best film of 1985, and I don't care what anyone else says. I mean, every performance was Oscar worthy.  ... needs to do more acting, but her schedule IS probably a bit hectic. Her performance as Sofia is awesome. Whoopi Goldberg as Celie...no one else could have played the part better. Danny Glover turns Mister into a three dimensional character that you can hate, laugh at, and feel sorry for at the same time. I just flat out love this movie.

I love it, and I have seen it over fifty times. I will see it fifty MORE times. Steven Speilberg created a classic. He can be sure that his first adult film was a success. It is filled with emotion, and the end always forces me to cry. I'm rambling and I know it, but this movie is awesome, people! I bought the Special Edition DVD, and the extras are great.

First, they were considered lower class status in the community and in one scene Oprah is physically reprimanded for her opinion. Then secondly the women were beaten and abuse by the black men. The black men came home from the field or jobs they had and took out their frustration on their women. The poor women had no way out, no freedom to run, no freedom in their homes. The women worked hard on the land and in their homes with no rewards. If they could have come home to gentle love with their husbands, it would be a tiny bit easier.

My father, who passed away a few years ago was raised on the farm in South Carolina and testified that the black population was an unfortunate breed of humanity, void without consience or reason and deserved total disclipine.  In 1985, when the movie came out, my parents felt that the world will cease to exist as we know it.  What they DID'NT know was that THE COLOR PURPLE was directed by Steven Spielberg, a white man and one of my parent's favorite directors.  When it came out on video, I, on impulse decided to rent it and see what the hulabaloo was all about.  After 2+ hours of raw emotion, I decided to tell my parents about this movie.  I rented it again and took it to my parent's house.  Picture this: My parents, friends and relatives thought I should have been tied up and sent to Happy Acres.  I told them to humor me and watch it.  The hardest hit was my father.  He went out to the video store the next day and bought it and watched it over and over again.  He was a changed man.  I know this is way overdue, but I applaud Steven Spielberg for having the courage to direct this movie in spite of its unpopular themes.  This movie is a classic for all time.  It ranks up there with Gone With The  Wind.  I can't watch the end of this movie without being cynical.  At every viewing, it's like watching it the first time.
