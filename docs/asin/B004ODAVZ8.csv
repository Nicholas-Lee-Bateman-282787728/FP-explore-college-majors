1422947,A3ILJUAT08YPXV,B004ODAVZ8,annyab,"[11, 13]",I am on my first week with the DVD set and I am really pleased with them. They are about an hour each but the time seems to go real quick. The circuit burnout is about 1 hr 20 mins and its a killer! I like that for each exercise there are easier options and the trainer points out to do as much as you can with good form instead of just trying to get all reps done. She gives great description of how to do them and what not to do. Also there is a counter for how far into the workout you are and also a mini countdown for each set. I am already seeing changes in my shape and feeling fitter. So many DVD's I wont get bored and I will be able to see progress as I can work towards doing the harder options.,5,brilliant,1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,706,"['am', 'first', 'week', 'DVD', 'set', 'am', 'really', 'pleased', 'are', 'hour', 'time', 'go', 'real', 'quick', 'circuit', 'burnout', '1', 'hr', '20', 'mins', 'killer', 'like', 'exercise', 'are', 'easier', 'options', 'trainer', 'out', 'do', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'good', 'form', 'instead', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'reps', 'done', 'great', 'description', 'how', 'do', 'what', 'not', 'do', 'Also', 'counter', 'how', 'far', 'workout', 'are', 'also', 'mini', 'countdown', 'set', 'am', 'already', 'seeing', 'changes', 'shape', 'feeling', 'fitter', 'So', 'many', 'DVD', 'wont', 'get', 'bored', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'progress', 'can', 'work', 'towards', 'doing', 'harder', 'options']",N/A

1422949,A2MGCJVV0ZPXA3,B004ODAVZ8,Eve Jameson,"[8, 16]","I have to say, I was all eager to get this DVD for Christmas. What caught my attention is that it's for ""women"". I used to do P90X, which actually is way better than this DVD and will be going back to it now. The only reason I wanted to try X-TrainFit because I figured the exercises were designed more for the female body as P90X has many things that was very difficult for me to do as a woman. And I am in shape, I was just looking to get more toned.I always like to read the negative reviews first, even though there wasn't a whole lot of negatives for this DVD, but I have to agree that the comments the main instructor says is really unnecessary and not even funny. I wasn't offended at all, it takes a LOT for me to get to that point, I just felt that she was like one of those women in the fitness world who has this macho attitude. There is funny, and then there is just flat out annoying, which she was.This isn't a race, and she doesn't have to put people down she is working out with, even if she thinks she was being ""funny"". Words like ""Sandbagging"", ""I'm gonna take away his man card"", ""Why am I'm the only one sweating?"", ""They are cheating"", etc. Really???She is a typical woman, who LOVES to hear the sound of her own voice. I'd like to just tell her to shut the heck up and workout instead.And I agree, this DVD is not all that great. I actually got bored one week into it. I think it was just hearing her stupid commentary what killed it for me. And even as a woman, I still found her constant yacking to be too much.Also, some of the workouts are way TOO long. And there is no mention of doing abs in conjunction with the workouts at least 3x a week.I agree with the other posters, repeating the same jokes gets stale. And again, ditto, I started to notice how even the guy in the video was getting annoyed with the instructor. Oh, and bad example to use your boss when you are imagining bashing his head against your knee, which she referred to in the video. Seriously??? So yeah, these are kinda stupid and annoying ""jokes"" she says throughout the video. Interesting because when I did P90X there are so many comments that got stuck in my head from Tony Horton and because they were USEFUL and INSPIRING!!!As far as the people in the video, I don't mind if they have everyday people even if they are not that much in shape. I think the point with that is to show the viewers that anyone can do it, even if you have a few extra pounds. I always thought it's unnecessary to put all muscular people in a video, when you know they have been working out all their lives to get to that point.About the workouts itself, like I said after a week of doing this I have had enough. It was actually boring to me and I am now going back to P90X. I may not be able to do everything in P90X, but at least I know the DVD does get me GREAT results.Just my 2 cents!",2,Disappointed in video!!!

I also had one issue with the &#34;Arms&#34; dvd and that was that from the first time ever I played it started to freeze with about 7 mins left to go... It has done it ever since.Other than her annoying remarks I love these Dvd's and would recommend them. I enjoy doing them and hope maybe Stephanie will do more with less snide remarks and maybe less lounges there where soooooooo or maybe a recommendation on them that one with bad knees can do instead of lounges...My knees aren't too bad but they where uncomfortable after doing a few even though I was making sure that the knee didn't go past my foot...I woudl recommend the dvd but try them all to be sure none freeze on you.,4,Hmmmm,1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,844,"['have', 'agree', 'Stephanie', 'annoying', 'dvd', 'time', 'do', 'workouts', 'wish', 'could', 'mute', 'still', 'hear', 'people', 'also', 'had', 'one', 'issue', '34', 'Arms', '34', 'dvd', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'played', 'started', 'freeze', 'about', '7', 'mins', 'left', 'go', 'done', 'ever', 'since.Other', 'annoying', 'remarks', 'love', 'Dvd', 'would', 'recommend', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'hope', 'maybe', 'Stephanie', 'will', 'do', 'more', 'less', 'snide', 'remarks', 'maybe', 'less', 'lounges', 'where', 'soooooooo', 'maybe', 'recommendation', 'one', 'bad', 'knees', 'can', 'do', 'instead', 'lounges', 'knees', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'where', 'uncomfortable', 'doing', 'few', 'even', 'was', 'making', 'sure', 'knee', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'past', 'foot', 'woudl', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'try', 'be', 'sure', 'none', 'freeze']",N/A

I like the fact that you can get quality workouts ranging from stretching to cardio.3.  Real people. It's great to see average size people doing this video.Cons:1. Time (weeks 1-3 and 10-12) require that you workout twice a day 1 to 3 days out of the week which time consuming. Plus several of the workouts were longer than 50 minutes.2. Video quality (the sound and the lighting was a bit off)3.

1422955,A1K2CN9WNIJ7ZM,B004ODAVZ8,Michele,"[2, 2]","I have been working out in gyms for years and finally decided to get some things for home. I like to have videos as a change up from weights alone and for extra cardio (no room for a cardio machine right now). I was really excited to get this set, but have been disappointed. It's not that the workouts are no good. They are challenging. I just do not like the format and the amount of time spent on each DVD. She spends A LOT of time explaining the movements and all the different modifications and does this for everything. While this is great if you need the instruction, you will not need that much instruction every time you do the workout. The time/rep count doesn't start until after all of the explaining, so there is a lot of wait time in between circuits and even within the same circuit. This just doesn't work for me. I get bored and really just want to get my workouts done. If the instruction took place during the activity (or was explained once before even starting) the DVDs would be more like 40-50 minutes with greater intensity.
