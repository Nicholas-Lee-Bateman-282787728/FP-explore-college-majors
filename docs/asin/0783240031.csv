68021,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,0783240031,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[1, 2]","The Story of Us starring Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer is a witty and clever look at a marriage falling apart after 15 years. This film is serious and funny, I love the flashbacks and yes there a lot of them but it shows how their relationship developed and why they have problems just like every married couple in America. In my opinion, this film is Rob Reiner's third best film, his two best being Stand By Me and When Harry met Sally. Pfeiffer's performance at the end of the film is spectacular, her dialogue is so long and impressive, she just goes on and on, never skipping a beat, who knew she could be so comical? The Story of Us is a fresh, rewarding look at two lives who must decide if they want to go their separate ways or remain an ""us.""

Whether the couple rekindles their relationship is secondary to figuring out why they are unhappy and what made them like each other to begin with.A blogger suggested that this film is Harry and Sally fromWhen Harry Met Sally... (Collector's Edition)only 15 years later. This makes a lot of sense to me.""The Story of Us"" explores the ultimate question of what happens to the ""happily ever after"" in cinema and in real life? When we see two characters fall in love in a romantic comedy are we ever applying the truth of the domestic struggles they will face on their story? Do we ever stop and wonder what will happen to them in 5 years? In 10 years? Or as in the case of ""The Story of Us"", in 15 years?Both leading actors are good in this film, but Bruce Willis shows acting prowess that he is usually not allowed or asked to demonstrate.

68025,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,0783240031,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[49, 54]","Occasionally shallow, occasionally moving, 'The Story of Us' is a rollercoaster ride through a couple's relationship, focusing on the myriad moments that defined their love, hate, and indifference. Structurally, the  film is almost a clone of Rob Reiner's earlier 'When Harry Met Sally',  complete with actor-to-audience monologues, flashforwards and flashbacks,  and wisecracking supporting characters who are occasionally more  interesting than the leads.The subject, a marriage that is unravelling,  does not necessarily make for a great theatre date movie (I can't see  somebody saying, &quot;Hey, baby, let's go see 'Who's Afraid of Virginia  Wolf' to get in 'the mood'&quot;), but on video, the film's many subtleties  and moods can be truly appreciated.The two leads, Bruce Willis, as a  laid-back, disorganized comedy writer, and Michelle Pfeiffer, as a  tightly-wound writer of crossword puzzles, have a lot of charm, but give  uneven performances. One wishes that Willis' intensity and energy in the  restaurant scene with Rob Reiner and Rita Wilson, or Pfeiffer's, in the  climactic speech at the film's conclusion, could have been maintained  through the entire film. There are a few too many moments where the actors  coast, for the film to be truly great.The high point of the film comes  near the conclusion, when Pfeiffer flashes back through a montage of the  major moments of her marriage. Until this sequence, the relationship  doesn't have an emotional core, something to really make us sympathize with  the couple. Reiner depends heavily on the stars' charisma to involve us,  but the nature of the story works against this. This isn't a knock at  Willis and Pfeiffer; I'm not sure Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan could have  pulled it off, either!The supporting cast is very good, particularly  Reiner and Wilson (she's making a career of playing wise-cracking friends  to neurotic women in big films!), Paul Reisner and Julie Hagerty (nice to  see her back, she looks marvellous!), and Tim Matheson, (who manages to  make a divorced, lonely dentist, trying to connect, not come across as his  character in 'Animal House'.) Watch, also, for a funny cameo by Betty  White, Red Buttons, Jayne Meadows, and Tom Poston, literally manifesting  the line about six people being in a married couple's bed.'The Story of  Us' is not as good a film as it might have been, but it does offer some  excellent moments, and the upbeat ending offers hope that, through  understanding, relationships do not have to self-destruct.This isn't a  bad message to pass along!",3,When Harry Left Sally...,949881600,"02 7, 2000",2000,2568,"['Occasionally', 'shallow', 'occasionally', 'moving', 'Story', 'Us', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'couple', 'relationship', 'focusing', 'myriad', 'moments', 'defined', 'love', 'hate', 'indifference', 'Structurally', 'film', 'almost', 'clone', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'earlier', ""'When"", 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'complete', 'actor-to-audience', 'monologues', 'flashforwards', 'flashbacks', 'wisecracking', 'supporting', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'occasionally', 'more', 'interesting', 'leads.The', 'subject', 'marriage', 'unravelling', 'not', 'necessarily', 'make', 'great', 'theatre', 'date', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'somebody', 'saying', 'quot', 'Hey', 'baby', 'let', 'go', 'see', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Wolf', 'get', ""'the"", 'mood', 'quot', 'video', 'film', 'many', 'subtleties', 'moods', 'can', 'be', 'truly', 'appreciated.The', 'two', 'leads', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'laid-back', 'disorganized', 'comedy', 'writer', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'tightly-wound', 'writer', 'crossword', 'puzzles', 'have', 'lot', 'charm', 'give', 'uneven', 'performances', 'One', 'Willis', 'intensity', 'energy', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'Pfeiffer', 'climactic', 'speech', 'film', 'conclusion', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'maintained', 'entire', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'moments', 'where', 'actors', 'coast', 'film', 'be', 'truly', 'great.The', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'conclusion', 'when', 'Pfeiffer', 'back', 'montage', 'major', 'moments', 'marriage', 'sequence', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'have', 'emotional', 'core', 'something', 'really', 'make', 'sympathize', 'couple', 'Reiner', 'heavily', 'stars', 'charisma', 'involve', 'nature', 'story', ""n't"", 'knock', 'Willis', 'Pfeiffer', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'either', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'particularly', 'Reiner', 'Wilson', 'making', 'career', 'playing', 'wise-cracking', 'friends', 'neurotic', 'women', 'big', 'films', 'Paul', 'Reisner', 'Julie', 'Hagerty', 'nice', 'see', 'back', 'marvellous', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'who', 'make', 'divorced', 'lonely', 'dentist', 'trying', 'connect', 'not', 'come', 'character', ""'Animal"", 'House', 'Watch', 'also', 'funny', 'cameo', 'Betty', 'White', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'Jayne', 'Meadows', 'Tom', 'Poston', 'literally', 'manifesting', 'line', 'six', 'people', 'being', 'married', 'couple', 'bed', ""'The"", 'Story', 'Us', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'offer', 'excellent', 'moments', 'upbeat', 'ending', 'offers', 'hope', 'understanding', 'relationships', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'self-destruct.This', ""n't"", 'bad', 'message', 'pass', 'along']",N/A

68027,A21OFC02P17G8B,0783240031,Brian Wrangham,"[1, 4]",Considering the talent involved in this film both behind the camera and in front of it this movie is an absolute failure. While the premise of the movie is acceptable (although somewhat hackneyed these days) much of its dialogue and plot development fall far short of its full potential. The movie's only redeeming features are a few amusing scenes and genuinely funny lines. Principal actors Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer and director Bob Reiner are all capable of much better work. Another of my  criticisms of this movie concerns the excessive use of the F-word. Considering the story being told and the type of characters telling it the frequency of the F-word is totally out of place in most instances. It is probably true to say that nowadays the F-word has been used so much in movies and elsewhere that it original meaning and impact have been so diluted that now it means practically nothing at all.,1,What a waste of talent,996278400,"07 28, 2001",2001,913,"['Considering', 'talent', 'involved', 'film', 'camera', 'front', 'movie', 'absolute', 'failure', 'premise', 'movie', 'acceptable', 'somewhat', 'hackneyed', 'days', 'much', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'development', 'fall', 'far', 'short', 'full', 'potential', 'movie', 'only', 'redeeming', 'features', 'are', 'few', 'amusing', 'scenes', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'lines', 'Principal', 'actors', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'director', 'Bob', 'Reiner', 'are', 'capable', 'much', 'better', 'work', 'criticisms', 'movie', 'excessive', 'use', 'F-word', 'Considering', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'type', 'characters', 'telling', 'frequency', 'F-word', 'totally', 'place', 'most', 'instances', 'probably', 'true', 'say', 'F-word', 'been', 'used', 'so', 'much', 'movies', 'elsewhere', 'original', 'meaning', 'impact', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'diluted', 'now', 'practically', 'nothing']",N/A

It might be a portrait of modern marriage in that the participants are  childish boors with little on their minds but &quot;esteem&quot; and  &quot;fulfillment,&quot; but Reiner fails to present their dilemma in an  interesting way.

Does he not SEE!"" ) One problem is that we never view  enough bad stuff to understand why these people with so much of what life  has to offer are so dissatisfied with each other. If the reason is just  that they are selfish and petty and wimpy, then we can't feel too much  sympathy for them. Michelle Pfeiffer in particular comes off badly, as an  uptight woman with weak reasons to be so unhappy. (The fact that, like most  wives, she had to carry the hard nurturing part of the relationship was not  effectively shown -- plus, Bruce Willis came across as pretty nurturing  himself.)The best part of the film is that it made me think over the  merits of my own marriage of more than 15 years -- you'd have to be a saint  not to think at least once during that long a span, would I be better off  without him/her? It takes some maturity to decide that the constant  compromising and stretching to accommodate another person's ego and needs  is worth the effort.

68030,A17N23WXA7EAF,0783240031,"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[0, 1]","I think the reviewer who titled his/her review &quot;could'a been a contender&quot; summed this film up best. &quot;The Story of Us&quot; is largely an intelligent film and at times an interesting character study, but unfortunately it constantly manages to deflate itself.Never mind the fact that the young Bruce Willis is denoted with a pony tail and the young Michelle Pfeiffer looks like she was a fashion consultant to the first lady in the seventies. Maybe Rob Reiner dressed his characters ironically.The evolving tension between the protagonists is portrayed in a palpable fashion. In fact, it is portrayed so well that the final climactic reconciliation scene appears to be implausible. I can see where the film tried to insert the building blocks of reconciliation and failed. The husband finally manages to empathize with his wife and runs to her apartment in order to tell her that he has seen himself through her eyes. But from the beginning of the film, we already know that he loves her and that he'll take enormous strides toward reconciliation. What we don't see is how his wife can change her neurotic habits and how he can curb his offensive, short-tempered responses to those habits. In the end we get a surreal monologue about how the couple should stay together because they have character and because relationships with alternative partners will produce problems of its own. This is the basis for two people who've driven each other nuts to suddenly get back together again? I don't think so.While the film is a formulaic failure, it does have wonderful moments. The scene in which the troubled couple encounters stereotypical, suburban, American tourists in Venice is hilarious. And perhaps the most astute scene is the metaphorical bedroom one in which the married couple is unable to make love because the incarnation of their parents appears in the same bed in order to nag them to the point of disruption.I usually love Rob Reiner's work and I certainly enjoyed parts of this one. Unfortunately I came away from the film feeling that our troubled couple would really be better off divorced.

There are times when you love your mate more than anything in the world...there are also times when you wish they would die so you could move on with your life.  That's marriage...it's not a bad thing, it's just a marriage thing.  Both Bruce and Michele show such depth here, really getting to the root of their marital problems and showing the real feelings of the parties involved.  The film takes you through the deterioration of a marriage all the way through the breaking point and then back around again to where they realize they need each other.  Michele's speach at the end of the film is what makes her performance for me.  She was spot on and so lovable.  You could really feel her charactor.  I do have to say that I feel Bruce is a very underappreciated actor.

Well, that's the feeling I got sitting through 90 minutes of Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer  fighting in &quot;The Story of Us.&quot;The basic story is about a  couple (Willis and Pfeiffer) who fight almost constantly.  As the Willis  character says, &quot;Argument has become the condition for  conversation.&quot;  And boy do they do a lot of it.Much of the film  consists of flashbacks of various fights the couple has had.  This begs the  question: what exactly are they fighting about all the time?  Who knows!  The film never tells us.  We see lots of shouting and angry faces and  slamming doors, but we never really get any insight into who this couple is  and what they're all about.  Why are they fighting?  Why do they still love  each other?  How did their kids turn out so great?  These are questions  that &quot;The Story of Us&quot; never bothers to answer.In the midst of  all the fighting there are several painfully unfunny scenes featuring  comedic actors Rob Reiner, Paul Reiser, Rita Wilson, and Julie Hagerty.  What's going on here?  These are funny people!  But not in this movie.  In  this script, comedy consists of lines such as &quot;Don't you hate it when  men leave the new roll of toilet paper on top of the empty tube?&quot;  No,  actually I just hate it when screenwriters think cliches like that are  funny.&quot;The Story of Us&quot; was directed by Rob Reiner, who  previously made the brilliant &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot;  This  film is nothing like that one.  As I was watching it, I kept asking myself,  &quot;Who read this script and actually thought it would be a good  movie?&quot;  Apparently Reiner, Willis, and Pfeiffer did.  But they were  most definitely wrong.The only saving grace of this film (and the thing  that keeps it from getting 1 star) is the terrific acting.  Willis and  Pfeiffer are very good.  The script is horrible, but they work very hard to  make the most of it.  I wanted to learn more about these people, I wanted  to understand them, I wanted to care about them.  &quot;The Story of  Us,&quot; unfortunately, never delivers on those hopes.",2,"If this is your story, please stay away from me!",963273600,"07 11, 2000",2000,2242,"['know', 'how', 'embarrassing', 'when', ""'re"", 'couple', 'start', 'fight', 'Remember', 'how', 'uncomfortable', 'feel', 'Well', 'feeling', 'got', 'sitting', '90', 'minutes', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'fighting', 'quot', 'Story', 'Us.', 'quot', 'basic', 'story', 'couple', 'Willis', 'Pfeiffer', 'who', 'fight', 'almost', 'constantly', 'Willis', 'character', 'quot', 'Argument', 'become', 'condition', 'conversation.', 'quot', 'boy', 'do', 'do', 'lot', 'it.Much', 'film', 'flashbacks', 'various', 'fights', 'couple', 'had', 'question', 'what', 'exactly', 'are', 'fighting', 'time', 'Who', 'film', 'never', 'see', 'lots', 'shouting', 'angry', 'slamming', 'doors', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'insight', 'who', 'couple', 'what', ""'re"", 'Why', 'are', 'fighting', 'Why', 'do', 'still', 'love', 'other', 'How', 'did', 'kids', 'turn', 'out', 'so', 'great', 'are', 'questions', 'quot', 'Story', 'Us', 'quot', 'never', 'bothers', 'answer.In', 'midst', 'fighting', 'are', 'several', 'painfully', 'unfunny', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'comedic', 'actors', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Paul', 'Reiser', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'Julie', 'Hagerty', 'What', 'going', 'here', 'are', 'funny', 'people', 'not', 'movie', 'script', 'comedy', 'consists', 'lines', 'such', 'quot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'when', 'men', 'leave', 'new', 'roll', 'toilet', 'paper', 'top', 'empty', 'tube', 'quot', 'No', 'actually', 'just', 'hate', 'when', 'screenwriters', 'think', 'cliches', 'are', 'funny.', 'quot', 'Story', 'Us', 'quot', 'was', 'directed', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'who', 'previously', 'made', 'brilliant', 'quot', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'quot', 'film', 'nothing', 'one', 'was', 'watching', 'kept', 'asking', 'quot', 'Who', 'read', 'script', 'actually', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'quot', 'Apparently', 'Reiner', 'Willis', 'Pfeiffer', 'did', 'were', 'most', 'definitely', 'wrong.The', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'thing', 'getting', '1', 'star', 'terrific', 'acting', 'Willis', 'Pfeiffer', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'script', 'horrible', 'work', 'very', 'hard', 'make', 'most', 'wanted', 'learn', 'more', 'people', 'wanted', 'understand', 'wanted', 'care', 'quot', 'Story', 'Us', 'quot', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'delivers', 'hopes']",N/A

And ""The Story of Us"" holds up a wonderful, rich, powerfully performed, and subtle mirror of marriage and family that may not be what a viewer really wants to see reflected back to them.  As a father of three sons who was essentially ""forced"" to accept divorce as the various therapists ""solution,"" I strongly feel that this movie would have made at least a dent in their arguments.  That is to say, ""The Story of Us"" dares to DEFY the politically, socially, culturally, and ""modern"" solution to marital ""unhappiness"" and stagnation: it ""allows"" the couple, Ben Jordan (played with great aplomb by Bruce Willis) and Katie Jordan (portrayed with enigmatic dexterity by Michelle Pfeiffer) to rediscover themselves and what is important to them.Marriage and family--the most critical social institutions of all societies--have become near ""cultural lags"" in todays world of rapid change and emphasis upon ""taking care of yourself first.""  For most people today, fifteen years of marriage is ""enough;"" and the Jordan's feel the pressures of giving up to find ""personal happiness.""  ""The Story of Us"" takes a subtle, sardonic, insightful look at how this couple struggles.  It shows the power of ""time outs"" for couples: time where each spouse can introspectively examine themselves without the ""pressures"" of children under foot; and, in this case, without the other spouse as well.  Yet, critics pan the film because they are ""looking"" for romance and sparks:""Willis and Pfeiffer, who should be flinty enough to strike sparks off each other, look glum and stony about the whole affair. All in all, a compelling argument for divorce.""Well, folks, divorce is a glum and stony act, BUT such actions are NOT a compelling argument for divorce--unless of course you BELIEVE in divorce as the be all solution to boredom or being frazzled (which is what Ben and Katie Jordan are experiencing).  Moreover, I can state emphatically, that I have suggested this movie to a number of couples experiencing the same things, and this movie provided them with great comic relief and a chance to really talk about their problems.  As a former professor of classes on The Family, one of my primary text books was ""Family Talk: Interpersonal Communication in the Family"" by Steven A. Beebe and John Masterson (ISBN: 9780075548966), something I still strongly believe to be the foundation for the survival of marriage and family as institutions.Please note, that I am not suggesting that ""The Story of Us"" is a self-help movie.  Rather, it is a very entertaining and subtle story that reflects real life.  And, even if you have a healthy relationship and/or family, I think you will enjoy this movie if you give it a chance.  That includes viewing ""The Story of Us"" not as a romantic or love story, but a story of marriage and family.Please Note: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.

68041,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0783240031,"""flickjunkie""","[2, 4]","This is a disturbing, bittersweet romantic comedy about two people whose 15 year marriage is unraveling. Actually, it is more of a romantic tragedy than a comedy. Ben and Katie Jordan (Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer)  are two mismatched people in the marriage that never should have been. He  is spontaneous, romantic and impulsive, with low frustration tolerance and  an explosive hair trigger temper. She is pragmatic, a compulsive  perfectionist with unrealistic expectations, and a high need for control.  She takes everything personally and never forgives or forgets a slight.  They both blame each other for their disappointments. The pattern is clear.  He doesn't meet her standards so she snipes, he explodes and then she  accuses him of not listening. She then throws up every mistake he's ever  made and every fault he's ever had. This goes on ad nauseam as their  romantic obsession with one another continues to get the best of any sense  they might have to call it quits. Like moths to a flame, they keep  returning for another scorching.This film is thought provoking in that  it portrays marital difficulties that are all too familiar in our society.  The problem is that it tries to give every problem known to man (with the  exception of wife beating) to this couple and relies on the single strand  of a long forgotten romance to be the only chance of keeping them  together.In watching the behind the scenes featurette on this film, Rob  Reiner and writers Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson discuss how the story  evolved. As it turns out, it was a montage of all their own marital  problems. So the film was, in essence cathartic dumping ground for the  writers and director.As filmmaking, it was terrific. Rob Reiner weaves  the story together expertly, creating a stark contrast between the joy of  the romance and the reality of the relationship. The film was punctuated by  numerous funny and sweet moments that make the viewer smile and glow with  delight.Michelle Pfeiffer gives a splendid performance of a very  emotionally complex and neurotic character. It took a lot of courage for  her to take this part because she was playing the least likeable character  in the film, something of a departure for her. Bruce Willis was as good as  one could have expected considering the fact that nobody was blowing  anything up. Actually, he was quite good as the impulsive, childlike  romantic, but when it came to the arguments and the serious displays of  resentment, he played the scenes too harshly, almost commando  style.Reiner does good camera work and puts together some good rapid  fire scenes that have impact and give great insight into the relationship.  He also took the film on location in Venice to add a little romantic  interlude, and somehow got Eric Clapton to write a great theme song.The  problem is the story. Reiner stated in the featurette that he intended this  to be a realistic bittersweet look at the real problems relationships face.  But he tried to do too much and made this film a grossly exaggerated  caricature of a relationship in crisis. It is really &quot;The War of The  Roses&quot; lite only it takes itself too seriously. No one I know who saw  this could believe that this couple could possibly have stayed married for  15 weeks, no less 15 years.The result is a noxious marathon of petty  arguments that get under the viewers' skin after a while. It is about as  entertaining as watching your best friends have a niggling argument in a  public restaurant.

The  character, Katie, was extremely unappealing to me.This movie shows how  accepting a certain role in your marriage can completely ruin it in the  end.  He was sort of a lovable goof while she was a pretentious, too  controlling shrew.  In the scene where they had their first date, I was  saying &quot;oh no, trouble&quot; as she began to straighten her forks and  napkins trying to make everything look &quot;perfect&quot;.  It shows a lot  of the things women do wrong in a relationship especially the scene where  they were getting ready to make love in the kitchen and she stopped to  write a letter to their kids at camp.  To me, this is a movie that people  who are about to get married should watch.Only problem I had was at the  end.  Her &quot;speech&quot; almost made me nauseous. In some ways, Michelle  Pheiffer's character was a little too stereotypical but then, there are  women like her so I just might be so different that I don't get it.

It wasn't this sloppy romantic comedy that we are often force fed with cupcakes.  The movie is about a couple who has been together for 15 years and is considering calling it quits.  They have the house, the kids and the great jobs, but they simply don't feel connected to one another.  No one cheated and there were no addictions that took hold of them.  It's simply the wear and tear of a relationship over time.  It was simply the day to day life of living together and going through the mundane motions from morning till night until you end up in the bed together facing forward instead of each other.I can understand how some might be disappointed in this movie having to watch an unhappy love story, but there are uplifting moments as the couple remembers how they once were and what drew them together to begin with.  It's not a full on intense drama, but more of a Dramedy with some cliche moments sprinkled throughout to keep it light.  Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis are the couple and I've never seen them look so sexy on screen.  This helps elevate the mood of the movie because they have charismatic charm and make a hot couple.  Unfortunately, they are at a crossroads in their relationship in the story and are considering splitting.I won't tell you what happens except that you may be pleased by the outcome if you're on the fence of sitting through an entire film about a couple wondering if they should split or not.  This is reality and although some want to avoid it, anyone that has been in a real long term relationship know about the grind and that this how it's going to be for the rest of our lives.  Can you live with that?  It won't be any different if you got involved with someone else.  You'd eventually reach that point with them as well.  Do you start over with that someone else?

He has helmed some very fine movies, including A Few Good Men, Misery and An American President. He has proved himself quite capable in the genres of comedy, drama and suspense. The stars of The Story of Us, Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer, are adept in many types of roles. But this movie isn't all that good, and I am quite surprised by this fact.Ben and Katie Jordan [Willis and Pfeiffer] have been married fifteen years or so. They keep up the appearance of getting along for the sake of their two children. When the kids go off together to a summer camp for several weeks, the Jordons immediately start a trial separation. The rest of the movie reveals how they cope with being apart. It also shows in flashbacks scenes from the marriage.To help you enjoy what there is to enjoy in The Story of Us, I should tell you that it is meant to be a comedy. I can't say if you will find it funny or not. I found some of it amusing, but was put off for several reasons. There are hilarious movies in which people bicker. Remember Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant? Hepburn and Spencer Tracy? Doris Day and Rock Hudson? Willis and Pfeiffer don't bicker. They harp at each other. Their arguments become too hostile and last too long. I found myself becoming more embarrassed for then than amused at them.The biggest problem is with Katie Jordan. The writers failed to give her any really valid reasons for flying off the handle every ten minutes. She is overwhelmed by the chaos in her life, but this chaos is truly ordinary stuff. As a result, Ben Jordan comes off as a really nice guy who is badgered into fighting with his neurotic wife. You want to tell Katie to get on Prozac and get on with her life.There are some good scenes in The Story of Us. My favorite was the one where Katie and Been are sitting in bed trying to reconcile once more. They can't do it, because the voices of each one's deceased parents are playing in their heads. What makes this scene so funny is that we see the parents sitting in the bed with them. I could really relate to this part because we are all programmed to some degree by the people who raised us. I only wish The Story of Us had had more of this element. If the movie had been about a couple's not being able to cope because of all the clutter in their heads and if we could have seen the people who adversely influenced them, then we might have had s funny Story of Us.",2,Hard to relate to this story of a bickering yuppie couple,1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,2538,"['Rob', 'Reiner', 'course', 'was', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'son-in-law', 'Meathead', 'Family', 'Mr.', 'Reiner', 'went', 'become', 'director', 'helmed', 'very', 'fine', 'movies', 'including', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'Misery', 'American', 'President', 'proved', 'quite', 'capable', 'genres', 'comedy', 'drama', 'suspense', 'stars', 'Story', 'Us', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'are', 'adept', 'many', 'types', 'roles', 'movie', ""n't"", 'good', 'am', 'quite', 'surprised', 'fact.Ben', 'Katie', 'Jordan', '[', 'Willis', 'Pfeiffer', ']', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'fifteen', 'years', 'so', 'keep', 'up', 'appearance', 'getting', 'along', 'sake', 'two', 'children', 'When', 'kids', 'go', 'off', 'together', 'summer', 'camp', 'several', 'weeks', 'Jordons', 'immediately', 'start', 'trial', 'separation', 'rest', 'movie', 'how', 'cope', 'being', 'apart', 'also', 'flashbacks', 'scenes', 'marriage.To', 'help', 'enjoy', 'what', 'enjoy', 'Story', 'Us', 'should', 'tell', 'meant', 'be', 'comedy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'will', 'find', 'funny', 'not', 'found', 'amusing', 'was', 'put', 'off', 'several', 'reasons', 'are', 'hilarious', 'movies', 'people', 'bicker', 'Remember', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Hepburn', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'Willis', 'Pfeiffer', 'do', ""n't"", 'bicker', 'harp', 'other', 'arguments', 'become', 'too', 'hostile', 'last', 'too', 'long', 'found', 'becoming', 'more', 'embarrassed', 'then', 'amused', 'them.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Katie', 'Jordan', 'writers', 'failed', 'give', 'really', 'valid', 'reasons', 'flying', 'off', 'handle', 'ten', 'minutes', 'overwhelmed', 'chaos', 'life', 'chaos', 'truly', 'ordinary', 'stuff', 'result', 'Ben', 'Jordan', 'off', 'really', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'badgered', 'fighting', 'neurotic', 'wife', 'want', 'tell', 'Katie', 'get', 'Prozac', 'get', 'are', 'good', 'scenes', 'Story', 'Us', 'favorite', 'was', 'one', 'where', 'Katie', 'Been', 'are', 'sitting', 'bed', 'trying', 'reconcile', 'once', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'voices', 'one', 'deceased', 'parents', 'are', 'playing', 'heads', 'What', 'scene', 'so', 'funny', 'see', 'parents', 'sitting', 'bed', 'could', 'really', 'relate', 'part', 'are', 'programmed', 'degree', 'people', 'who', 'raised', 'only', 'wish', 'Story', 'Us', 'had', 'had', 'more', 'element', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'couple', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'cope', 'clutter', 'heads', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'people', 'who', 'adversely', 'influenced', 'then', 'might', 'have', 'had', 's', 'funny', 'Story', 'Us']",N/A

68066,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0783240031,Reviewer,"[15, 16]","There's an underlying sadness that permeates this story of a marriage in trouble after fifteen years and two children that is so readily and immediately discernible that initially it becomes difficult to proceed.  And you quickly realize that it's because ""The Story of Us,"" directed by Rob Reiner, is indeed a story about loss, which is something that affects everyone in some way or another, at one time or another, and depending upon your personal frame of reference and experience, it's a story that is going to affect you on any number of levels.  Because loss comes in many forms; sometimes it leaves nothing more than a blip on the surface of your Moon, while at other times it leaves a gaping crater on the landscape of your World, and whichever it is in your case, this film is going to address it and perhaps make you revisit a time or place that maybe you've locked away in the dim recesses of your memory for better or worse.  One thing is certain, this film is going to make you take pause and reflect for a moment or two.  Because ""Us,"" anyway you slice it, is a film about you and me.Reflection is the key word here, for Reiner has crafted a film that is steeped in it; it's the way the characters involved play through the drama of their immediate lives and attempt to get on with it.  And it becomes an almost voyeuristic journey as you watch two people attempting to discover just what went wrong with their love, and not only when, but why.  Katie Jordan (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Ben Jordan (Bruce Willis) had it all at one time, but something happened; something in the fifteen years between the merging of two lives into one, during which they brought two children into the world and knew true happiness, and the realization that things had changed suddenly.  Or, perhaps, not so suddenly; and it's almost uncomfortable to be a part of it, observing from the sidelines and understanding what the principals involved simply can't seem to comprehend.It's the little things that are doing them in, and they just don't see it.  The main element being the inability to see themselves through the eyes of the other.  And it's not that they're self-centered by any means, it just a matter of instinctively wanting to maintain the autonomy that makes them unique, which in the beginning was what attracted them to one another.  It's a conundrum, and it's universal.  It's a matter of two people needing to reach that point-- which according to the individuals involved is going to vary greatly-- at which they can step outside of themselves and truly align their spirit with that of their significant other.  Some may call it unconditional love, but in reality it's something that goes beyond even that.  It's like discovering the meaning of life, or the true meaning of love.  And for some, it's something that unfortunately may forever fall just beyond their ability to grasp.A dramatic film with comedic overtones-- inasmuch as life itself is often funny, even at the most inopportune times-- Reiner takes something of a ""When Harry Met Sally"" approach with it, which initially doesn't seem to work; after all, this is decidedly not a romantic comedy.  But as the story unfolds you begin to realize that Reiner knows exactly what he's doing, because in retrospect, this is the way it goes in real life.  Things may be disintegrating internally, but life goes on; where the good times and laughter prevailed before, it remains, undaunted by the strife it fails to recognize in it's midst.  So, in the end, you have to give Reiner credit for having his finger on the pulse of reality, which at the beginning of the film comes across as somewhat pretentious, but by the end makes perfect sense and works beautifully in the telling of this story.Michelle Pfeiffer turns in a heartfelt performance as Katie, proving once again what a gifted actor she truly is.  Watching Katie, you know exactly what she is feeling and why, and Pfeiffer allows you to become emotionally involved to the point that you want to intervene and tell her you know what the problem is and how she can fix it.  Her Katie is a good person, a loving wife and mother, and you desperately want things to work out for her.  And it's frustrating to have to sit on the sidelines and be unable to help.  Which says something about the caliber of her performance.  It's that reality she brings to the character that draws you in so intimately, and it's one of the strengths of the film.Another strong point is the performance of Bruce Willis, who as Ben continues to shed that tough guy, ""Die Hard"" persona and emerge as an extremely capable actor with a range that is expanding with every movie he makes, which he's demonstrated in such films as ""Unbreakable"" and ""The Sixth Sense.""  Suffice to say that he's come a long way since his ""Moonlighting"" days.The supporting cast includes Colleen Rennison (Erin), Jake Sandvig (Josh), Rita Wilson (Rachel), Rob Reiner (Stan), Julie Hagerty (Lisa), Tim Matheson (Marty), Red Buttons (Arnie), Jayne Meadows (Dot), Betty White (Lillian) and Tom Poston (Harry).

68067,A2HRVVDJMY5M4Z,0783240031,R. Graff,"[0, 0]","I remember wanting to see this movie when it first came out, thinking that it looked pretty funny.  It tells the story about a married couple who, after 15 years of marriage, are wondering whether they should get a divorce or ""keep on truckin' ""  It sounds like an interesting concept, and one that should really interest the viewer, but in my case, it failed.First off, I will admit there are some amusing scenes, and I think with such talented actors as Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer receiving direction from the equally talented director, Rob Reiner, there are a lot of reasons to think this movie will be wonderful.  But there are two problems that the movie has that it never seems capable of fixing.  First off, the only effective scenes are the couple's bad times where they are screaming at each other or slamming doors in each others' faces.  The few scenes that are supposed to be ""good times,"" such as how they met and how they got engaged are so lifeless and done with too much nonchalance to really make an impact.  The even bigger problem, as the amazon.com review states, is that the two actors just have no chemistry between them.  It almost feels like you are watching a date between two people who, through no fault of their own, just don't mesh well and in the end don't hit it off.In short, the movie is hoping the viewer roots for them to stay together, but from my perspective, they can't go to divorce court soon enough.  It was a very good idea that was not projected well, despite some very able and willing talent.  If you are a fan of any of the people I mentioned earlier, there are many better movies to seek out, and not many that are worse.",2,"It should work, but it doesn't",1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,1676,"['remember', 'wanting', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'thinking', 'looked', 'pretty', 'funny', 'story', 'married', 'couple', 'who', '15', 'years', 'marriage', 'are', 'wondering', 'should', 'get', 'divorce', 'keep', 'truckin', 'interesting', 'concept', 'one', 'should', 'really', 'interest', 'viewer', 'case', 'failed.First', 'off', 'will', 'admit', 'are', 'amusing', 'scenes', 'think', 'such', 'talented', 'actors', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'receiving', 'direction', 'equally', 'talented', 'director', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'are', 'lot', 'reasons', 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'wonderful', 'are', 'two', 'problems', 'movie', 'never', 'capable', 'fixing', 'First', 'only', 'effective', 'scenes', 'are', 'couple', 'bad', 'times', 'where', 'are', 'screaming', 'other', 'slamming', 'doors', 'others', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'good', 'times', 'such', 'how', 'met', 'how', 'got', 'engaged', 'are', 'so', 'lifeless', 'done', 'too', 'much', 'nonchalance', 'really', 'make', 'impact', 'even', 'bigger', 'problem', 'amazon.com', 'review', 'states', 'two', 'actors', 'just', 'have', 'chemistry', 'almost', 'feels', 'are', 'watching', 'date', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'fault', 'own', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'well', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'hit', 'short', 'movie', 'hoping', 'viewer', 'roots', 'stay', 'together', 'perspective', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'divorce', 'court', 'soon', 'enough', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'was', 'not', 'projected', 'well', 'very', 'able', 'willing', 'talent', 'are', 'fan', 'people', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'are', 'many', 'better', 'movies', 'seek', 'out', 'not', 'many', 'are', 'worse']",N/A

68075,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,0783240031,Thayer,"[0, 0]","The first thing that comes to mind in describing how the story in the movie was told is MESSY! There is the present tense where the basic plot was happening, there were boatloads of short as well as lengthy flashbacks, there were confessionals/interviews (just like the one done in the series Once and Again and most reality series), voiceover narration (from the confessionals), there were 2 perspectives shown back and forth, and lastly, yup there were lots of flashbacks. That would actually be fine, this is not the first movie to have that kind of storytelling tapestry, but in this movie it felt choppy, unfocused, disorganized, and disjointed. The flashbacks were repetitive and took too much of the movie. And it's not like they're really essential in the movie or at least the manner that they were used in the movie. Another noticeable flaw was that this was supposed to be a movie about what happens after they live happily ever after? The answer is basically the same, ""they live happily ever after"". I have no problem with the characters reconciling in the end, but don't you think it's done the way Hollywood often does it which is simplistic and shallow.But the movie had some positive aspects. The movie was actually full of amusing, funny, and s5ometimes even poignant anecdotes/vignettes/montages, but I think the movie relied too much on those short scenes. Individually those tiny scenes worked, but collectively not so much.I'm really surprised that before this film was released there was so much hype that this was going to be another career defining movie for Michelle Pfeiffer. She gave a wonderful performance but definitely not on par with her best work. The high point of her performance comes at the end of the movie as she gave her monologue. It was dramatic, funny, and over the top and Pfeiffer was great in it. Even though I'm not totally sold on the chemistry of Pfeiffer and Willis, Bruce Willis gave a wacky performance. This role is probably the romantic equivalent of his usual roles in action movies. And he was quite well in the few dramatic scenes especially when he had a breakdown in the restaurant and he quietly sobbed outside. Rita Wilson and Paul Reiser appeared briefly in the movie. Both of them had some funny scenes especially Wilson's funny anecdotes/philosophy on the differences between the two sexes or more bluntly the difference between penis and vagina.If you're a fan of Michelle Pfeiffer, even though this is probably not one of her best movies, I'm sure you'll find the appeal of this movie just like the way I did.Grade: B",3,The Story of Us,1129420800,"10 16, 2005",2005,2584,"['first', 'thing', 'mind', 'describing', 'how', 'story', 'movie', 'was', 'told', 'MESSY', 'present', 'tense', 'where', 'basic', 'plot', 'was', 'happening', 'were', 'boatloads', 'short', 'as', 'well', 'lengthy', 'flashbacks', 'were', 'confessionals/interviews', 'just', 'one', 'done', 'series', 'Once', 'Again', 'most', 'reality', 'series', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'confessionals', 'were', '2', 'perspectives', 'shown', 'back', 'forth', 'lastly', 'were', 'lots', 'flashbacks', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'fine', 'not', 'first', 'movie', 'have', 'kind', 'storytelling', 'tapestry', 'movie', 'felt', 'choppy', 'unfocused', 'disorganized', 'disjointed', 'flashbacks', 'were', 'repetitive', 'took', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'not', ""'re"", 'really', 'essential', 'movie', 'least', 'manner', 'were', 'used', 'movie', 'noticeable', 'flaw', 'was', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'movie', 'what', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'answer', 'basically', 'same', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'have', 'problem', 'characters', 'reconciling', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'done', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'often', 'simplistic', 'movie', 'had', 'positive', 'aspects', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'full', 'amusing', 'funny', 's5ometimes', 'even', 'poignant', 'anecdotes/vignettes/montages', 'think', 'movie', 'relied', 'too', 'much', 'short', 'scenes', 'Individually', 'tiny', 'scenes', 'worked', 'collectively', 'not', 'so', 'much.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'hype', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'career', 'defining', 'movie', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'gave', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'definitely', 'not', 'par', 'best', 'work', 'high', 'point', 'performance', 'end', 'movie', 'gave', 'monologue', 'was', 'dramatic', 'funny', 'top', 'Pfeiffer', 'was', 'great', 'Even', ""'m"", 'not', 'totally', 'sold', 'chemistry', 'Pfeiffer', 'Willis', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'gave', 'wacky', 'performance', 'role', 'probably', 'romantic', 'equivalent', 'usual', 'roles', 'action', 'movies', 'was', 'quite', 'well', 'few', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'especially', 'when', 'had', 'breakdown', 'restaurant', 'quietly', 'sobbed', 'outside', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'Paul', 'Reiser', 'appeared', 'briefly', 'movie', 'had', 'funny', 'scenes', 'especially', 'Wilson', 'funny', 'anecdotes/philosophy', 'differences', 'two', 'sexes', 'more', 'bluntly', 'difference', 'penis', 'vagina.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'even', 'probably', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'find', 'appeal', 'movie', 'just', 'way', 'did.Grade', 'B']",N/A

This is a film that hits a real emotional element in people who are going through or who have gone through a rocky relationship.  The Story of Us is a film about two people who have come to a critical point in their relationship where it's time to decide if they go on to the next phase of their relationship or if they put an end to their story.  In every relationship this point comes, whether the couple is married or whether they are just dating, there comes a point in all relationships where it's time to decide if it's a relationship worth sustaining and striving to improve, or if the relationship has reached it's end.  The Story of Us does a good job in showing both sides of the relationship, the starting out point where everything is fresh and exciting and full of passion and the diminishing side which shows the fights and anguish.  It's a poignant movie that anyone who is in a relationship or who has ever been in one should see for it almost forces you to look and examine how you are in your own relationships.",5,A Mirror Of All Rocky Relationships,1137196800,"01 14, 2006",2006,1236,"['one', 'admit', 'not', 'were', 'ever', 'relationship', 'was', 'going', 'rocky', 'time', ""'m"", 'sure', 'aspect', 'film', 'could', 'relate', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'film', 'real', 'emotional', 'element', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'Story', 'Us', 'film', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'critical', 'point', 'relationship', 'where', 'time', 'decide', 'go', 'next', 'phase', 'relationship', 'put', 'end', 'story', 'relationship', 'point', 'couple', 'married', 'are', 'just', 'dating', 'point', 'relationships', 'where', 'time', 'decide', 'relationship', 'worth', 'sustaining', 'striving', 'improve', 'relationship', 'reached', 'end', 'Story', 'Us', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'sides', 'relationship', 'starting', 'out', 'point', 'where', 'everything', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'full', 'passion', 'diminishing', 'side', 'fights', 'anguish', 'poignant', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'relationship', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'one', 'should', 'see', 'almost', 'look', 'examine', 'how', 'are', 'own', 'relationships']",N/A
