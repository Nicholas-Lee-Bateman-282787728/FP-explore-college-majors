(Props to Ms. H. for having the good humor to tweak her outgrown hippie persona.)

Idle is a stock broker (or something financial like that, the exact job is sort of skipped over...)who was raised by a family of Hindus, and then finds he was adopted by them and he is the rightful heir to the dukedom belonging to his friend and boss Rick Moranis...The beautiful Barbara Hershey (a blonde here) is Idle's real mother, the even more beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones is Moranis fiancee, (and Idle's one night stand..)in one of her early appearances... and John Cleese is the shifty lawyer who decides to help Idle regain his rightful heritage by killing everyone who stands in the way...(but why does the movie,in the opening credits say &quot;introducing John Cleese&quot;?)

44748,AWXJ63WUFSWO6,0783207425,Mrs. Entity,"[0, 0]","This is not a great movie, but it's a good movie.  It's not the slapstick laugh riot I expected, but it did make me laugh.  I give it four stars because I think Eric underplayed his character, and his performance came off a bit too laconic for my taste.  You may have a different opinion.  The story idea is funny: two babies abandoned at birth and mistakenly placed with the wrong families meet again purely by coincidence, and one spends much of the movie trying to do the other in, with (predictably) hilarious results.  But it's hard to believe that Tommy and Henry are the same age--Eric is rather wrinkled for a supposedly 30-year-old man.  And it's hard to believe that Tommy hasn't figured out he's not Pakistani.  I think that was supposed to be funny, but it didn't work that way for me.The good news is that it comes off nicely and is fun to watch.  Eric's turn as Tommy's hippie dad in the beginning of the movie is great--he looks spot-on like Sonny Bono.  Rick is a likeably quirky character, and the only honest one of the bunch.  John Cleese is brilliant as the sleazy lawyer, Shadgrind.  Barbara Hershey's turn as the nymphomaniac Duchess of Bournemouth is just subtle enough to be interesting and just over-the-top enough to be really funny.  Catherine Zeta-Jones does a great job as Henry's gorgeous, gold-digging fiancee.It all ends happily, though there's a lot of doubt right up till the last moments of the film.  There's a Pythonesque tag at the end that's good for laughs.
