Emma Samms was a little weak in her part, but Bruce Greenwood was breathtaking.  It made me take notice of the title and since I got to watch the entire movie without commercials I had no idea what the name was. I just remember Emma from General Hospital and Bruce's stunning good looks.",5,Treacherous reviews,1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,408,"['watched', 'movie', 'was', 'recuperating', 'broken', 'leg', 'beauty', 'country', 'settings', 'was', 'breath', 'taking', 'Emma', 'Samms', 'was', 'little', 'weak', 'part', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'made', 'take', 'notice', 'title', 'got', 'watch', 'entire', 'movie', 'commercials', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'name', 'was', 'just', 'remember', 'Emma', 'General', 'Hospital', 'Bruce', 'stunning', 'good', 'looks']",Harlequin: Treacherous Beauties

Emma Sams is beautiful and warm, and Bruce Greenwood is handsome and winning; he has that certain magnetic spark that he always brings to his roles.  The setting is lovely:  green and wild.  Horses feature prominently in the story and complement the natural beauty.

1197692,A3685VOD2RA3TP,B001GLLMWW,"Laura Johnson ""classic movie junky""","[1, 1]","Treacherous Beauties is a wonderful story of romance and intrigue. Bruce Greenwood and Emma Samms are great together. They don't have to say a word for you to sense their attraction to each other. The smoldering look in their eyes says it all. Most of the Harlequin movies I have seen are excellent and this is no exception. If you are looking for romance and intrigue this is a movie you will certainly enjoy. I first watched it from Netflix and enjoyed it so much, I purchased it from Amazon and have watched it several times. I highly recommend this movie.

What's interesting is the depth of the story from the different themes entwined.  This is one movie I watch over and over and it doesn't hurt that Bruce Greenwood was very sexy! NOTE: This DVD purchase is in case my VHS fades.  I have dozens of romance movies on VHS from the mid and late 1980s and in the process of replacing them with DVDs since VHS will fade.  The best way to store VHS is vertical with the rewind tape on bottom and away from the sun and humidity even though stored in a box.,5,Great Romance,1243036800,"05 23, 2009",2009,596,"['wish', 'were', 'more', 'movies', 'one', 'romantic', 'tension', 'main', 'characters', 'What', 'interesting', 'depth', 'story', 'different', 'themes', 'entwined', 'one', 'movie', 'watch', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'was', 'very', 'sexy', 'NOTE', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'case', 'VHS', 'fades', 'have', 'dozens', 'romance', 'movies', 'VHS', 'mid', 'late', '1980s', 'process', 'replacing', 'DVDs', 'VHS', 'will', 'fade', 'best', 'way', 'store', 'VHS', 'vertical', 'rewind', 'tape', 'bottom', 'away', 'sun', 'humidity', 'even', 'stored', 'box']",Harlequin: Treacherous Beauties
