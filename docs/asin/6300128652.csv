I don't know if this is the worst movie ever made, but it's the worst I've ever seen. It was like end-to-end junk. No plot, no acting, no direction, no point. A scrap yard, a wrecker dump. A gun collection. These people (they weren't actors) were given lines to say 2 minutes before filming, and they said them. Some of them made faces. A lot of triggers were pulled, and men ran around shooting. The body-count was innumerable. Jaw-dropping, mind-numbing, belief-begging. Ugh-gh-gh. I'll just add something to that. If someone had deliberately set out to make the worst movie ever made they could not have made one worse than Hangmen.

I'm sure this one would end up there if it weren't for all of the violence.  The acting is downright horrible (never made it to the part with Sandra in it... I was about to throw up after 30 minutes and couldn't take any more).  The cinematography is even worse... some of the worst angles, light/dark problems, etc. I've ever seen.

One of them is that it ENDS.However, some snippets here and there are kind of interesting. The gun-cam shots, Sandra Bullock's tranquelized stupor, and maybe one or two other rare moments shine above the mid-80s film school quality that makes up the bulk of this flick. Other parts are downright dumb, and / or rottenly acted (can you say, ""friends of the director?""). Sandra really is the best of the cast, even for an early work.Overall, it looks like the movie was made on a super low budget at some college campus. Most of the budget went into renting guns, apparently.The basic plot is that an estranged father turns out to be a former CIA agent. Bad guys decide to kill him before he is re-activcated to kill them. Son, ex-wife, son's girlfriend, and Dad's old Special Forces Army buddies are all put in danger.It certainly isn't great or memorable. At times it's downright confusing. But even so it is better than some of the flicks being cranked out for release today (release direct to video, anyway). At least the movie is cohesively bad, and stays true to whatever atmosphere it attempts to create, bad or not.I can't say it was a complete waste of my time, but yeah... it was a real clock-watcher.",2,"MST3K, where are you when we need you?",980726400,"01 29, 2001",2001,1269,"['be', 'entirely', 'fair', 'movie', 'good', 'points', 'One', 'ENDS.However', 'snippets', 'here', 'are', 'kind', 'interesting', 'gun-cam', 'shots', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'tranquelized', 'stupor', 'maybe', 'one', 'two', 'other', 'rare', 'moments', 'shine', 'mid-80s', 'film', 'school', 'quality', 'up', 'bulk', 'flick', 'Other', 'parts', 'are', 'downright', 'dumb', '/', 'rottenly', 'acted', 'can', 'say', 'friends', 'director', 'Sandra', 'really', 'best', 'cast', 'even', 'early', 'work.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'super', 'low', 'budget', 'college', 'campus', 'Most', 'budget', 'went', 'renting', 'guns', 'apparently.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'estranged', 'father', 'out', 'be', 'former', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Bad', 'guys', 'decide', 'kill', 're-activcated', 'kill', 'Son', 'ex-wife', 'son', 'girlfriend', 'Dad', 'old', 'Special', 'Forces', 'Army', 'buddies', 'are', 'put', 'danger.It', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'great', 'memorable', 'times', 'downright', 'confusing', 'even', 'better', 'flicks', 'being', 'cranked', 'out', 'release', 'today', 'release', 'direct', 'video', 'anyway', 'least', 'movie', 'cohesively', 'bad', 'true', 'atmosphere', 'create', 'bad', 'not.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'yeah', 'was', 'real', 'clock-watcher']",N/A

I'm sure she doesn't include this turkey on her resume.  There's not one redeeming quality to this so-called thriller.
