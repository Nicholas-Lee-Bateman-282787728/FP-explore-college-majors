494310,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B000006GFD,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[20, 21]","John Murray...probably the least known of all the Murray brothers (all four of which appeared in the 1988 film Scrooged)...of course everyone knows Bill (Caddyshack, Stripes, What About Bob?), and many are probably familiar with brother Brian Doyle-Murray (Caddyshack, Christmas Vacation, ""Get a Life""), and then there's Joel (One Crazy Summer, ""Dharma & Greg""), but what about John?  He's least active in terms of a lengthy film career, and in the one film he actually starred in, he got crowded out of the spotlight by a an 80 year old woman named Nedra Volz...oh, I thought he was funny alright, but Ms. Volz tended to steal the show.  Co-written and directed by Neal Israel (Police Academy, Bachelor Party, Real Genius), the film stars the aforementioned John Murray (Scrooged) and James Keach (Cannonball, The Long Riders).  Also appearing in this ensemble cast is Jennifer Tilly (Bride of Chucky, Monsters, Inc.), Brian Backer (Fast Times at Ridgemont High), Ned Eisenberg (Million Dollar Baby), Wendie Jo Sperber (Bachelor Party, Back to the Future), Fred Willard (A Mighty Wind), Sally Kellerman (Back to School), Robert Conrad (""The Wild Wild West""), Nedra Volz (Lust in the Dust), and flash in the pan Clara Peller, best know as the old woman constantly looking for the beef in a series of Wendy's commercials from the 80s...one can't help but wonder is she ever found that much sought after beef...actually, she did, appearing in a spaghetti sauce commercial claiming to have found it, which ultimately caused her gig as the Wendy's `Where's the beef?' spokesperson to be cut short...apparently they didn't like someone piggybacking off their wildly successful ad campaign.As the film begins we see various individuals, including wise cracking Dana Cannon (Murray), stopped for traffic violations.  After going to court, presided over by Judge Nedra Henderson (Kellerman), the group is ordered to attend traffic school and pass the course, or their driving privileges will be permanently revoked, and their impounded vehicles sold with the proceeds going to the county.  Turns out the traffic school is being taught by the incredibly uptight Deputy Halik (Keach), who was in line for a promotion, but has since been demoted, blaming his current state of affairs squarely on Dana (you'll have to see the film for all the details), and now seeks revenge (Dana's livelihood depends on making deliveries in his truck).  Anyway, turns out the judge has a plan to make some money, one which she needs the aid of Deputy Halik in that if the students fail, the judge and himself will scam half the proceeds of the money made from the sale of their impounded vehicles, so Halik, in turn makes the test impossible, and all end up failing.  The students catch wind of the scheme, set out to even the score, the result being an incredibly silly and stupid fun, but one that's also a lot of fun.If you enjoyed the original Police Academy film (not so much the progressively worse sequels), then you probably enjoy this film.  The set up is about the same in that of a group of loser types struggling against a evil archetype who holds their future in his/her hands, deliberately driving them towards failure, that is until the loser group pulls it together, overcoming adversity, and saving the day...or something like that...Murray is pretty funny doing his best impersonation of his brother Bill's smarmy, wisecracking character probably most apparent in his 1981 film Stripes...seriously, the two are so similar the only difference is brother Bill came along with the act first, so it seems like he's just trying to ape someone else's success with a preconceived characterization.  As far as Ms. Tilly (playing the ditzy rocket scientist), I'm glad she had as few lines as she did, as I generally find her shrilly voice to be fairly annoying, reminding me much of that of a squeaky toy.  The best scenes, in my opinion, involve Nedra Volz as sort of a Mr. Magoo-ish character, hampered by poor eyesight...there's one scene where the group uses her as a lookout, and upon their return, they ask her if she's seen anybody, to which she replies `I don't know.' (It's much funnier on the screen).  Another funny scene is when they're commiserating as a group (followed by an 'it's not over till it's over!' speech delivered by Murray's character, reminiscent of the one John Belushi's character gave in the 1978 film Animal House, only not as good) after they've learned they all failed their driving tests, and a drunken Mrs. Houk begins throwing out suggestions as to what they should do with Deputy Halik, specifically relating to his private parts (nothing like an inebriated old woman yelling for the emasculation of her enemy).  The funniest scene, in my opinion, occurs when Mrs. Houk has to retrieve some evidence from Judge Henderson's home (because she was the only one who would fit through the open window), and she has to sneak into the bedroom where the Judge and Deputy Halik are involved in a copulatory moment on the bed.  Mrs. Houk trips, ending up on the bed with them, and the couple don't even notice her presence as she's rolling around on top of them...again, this is a scene that must be seen to fully appreciate the humor.  I thought Keach did very well playing the semi-psychotic heavy (with twitching eye and all).  Overall the story is very silly, and the comedy doesn't always work, but enough of it does to the point where it was able to carry the rest of the film well.Anchor Bay Entertainment provides a clean and clear widescreen (1.85:1) picture, along with a choice in terms of audio in either Dolby Digital 5.1 or Dolby Digital Surround 2.0.  Special features include an original theatrical trailer, audio commentary with director Neal Israel, and an insert booklet called `The Official Moving Violations Driver's Handbook', which has a good deal of photos from the film, along with a lot of comical material.  Also included are previews for other Anchor Bay releases like License to Drive (1988), Freaked (1993), and Modern Problems (1981).Cookieman108By the way, this film also marks the very first big screen

494322,A3V5JJF982NS48,B000006GFD,"ricardo_guerrero ""ricardo_guerrero""","[1, 1]","I first saw ""Traffic School"" (its other name) right after it first came out, in the mid 80s.  I found it funny, but in those days, it was hard to even buy a videotape, and the video store where we rented it from eventually closed.  Many years later, I found it on Amazon (some ex-rental VHS tapes) but by then I had no VCR! Finally, in 2005, it came out on DVD and I was overjoyed!In short...this is a goofy film.  It's not a very good movie, when all is said and done.  It was mostly shot in Los Angeles, although as director Neal Israel states, the objective was to make Birch County a very futuristic sort of place, and he definitely accomplished that.But it's definitely ""a bad movie to love"", and that's why I give it five stars.  The actors are excellent and for the most part, they are able to carry off a very limp storyline.  John Murray, who unfortunately never had a decent career because he is related to the great Bill Murray, carries the starring role as wise-cracking plant nursery owner Dana Cannon perfectly.  Like his elder brother, he's just automatically funny.  One of my friends met John in person about 5 years ago and apparently he's really nice, and has a great sense of humor.  James Keach first played a cop in ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" a couple of years earlier - the cop who pulls over Clark Griswold after he forgets to un-tie Aunt Edna's dog from the trailer hitch.  He got the chance to expand that role in ""Moving Violations"", and turns in a virtuoso performance as Halik, the unscrupulous policeman.  One of my favorite scenes in it is the arm wrestling bit with Dana and Halik, which ends in an unexpectedly gay move on the otherwise-straight Dana's part.  Fun stuff.Jennifer Tilly and the late, great Wendy Jo Sperber (in a hilarious wig) are also outstanding as two of the traffic school students.  Jennifer plays Amy Hopkins, a NASA rocket scientist (yes) and the romance that develops between her and Dana Cannon is a real kick in the pants.  Wendy Jo, as usual, plays an overweight and problemated lady...this time she's hypochondriac Joan Pudillo, and her secondary storyline with the legendary Fred Willard puts the icing on the cake.  There was a scene, deleted, with her in the back of a truck with some pigs...I once saw a publicity photo of this.  I wish the deleted scenes had been included on this DVD!  The supporting cast are splendid too - Nedra Volz and Clara Peller have a great scene together as the old ladies who get busted at the airport when they...drive out onto the tarmac.  Ned Eisenberg also submits a hilarious characterization of Wink Barnes, a gore-loving goofball who drives a hearse.  Sally Kellerman is at her usual best as the voluptuous Judge Henderson, and Robert Conrad (uncredited in the film but not sure why?) has a few funny scenes as the police chief who demotes Halik to traffic school instructor.The story of ""Moving Violations"" is a fun one.  They set up a pretty believable situation - drivers sentenced to traffic school.  It starts off much better than it finishes.  The last couple of sequences (including the lame collision course bit) don't really make an impact or leave things much better.  But things end on a happy note as they all get their cars back and moments later, are arrested yet again for moving violations.The commentary track with director Neal Israel is great.  I am not familiar with anything else of his other than ""Police Academy I"" and ""Bachelor Party"", which of course went on to become classics.  He did say that it went from production to theater in under 6 months - perhaps it was a bit of a rush job.  The reviews of the film were almost all negative and the box office draw was minimal.I'm guessing ""Moving Violations"" didn't fare any better on DVD than it did at the box office and that's why it's no longer available.  The movie didn't do well at the box office either, and I think it was one of those movies that went almost straight to video, and enjoyed a certain amount of success in video stores.

494323,A3NG7X4APIV649,B000006GFD,Sam I Am,"[0, 0]","""Moving Violations"" is one of my most favorite comedy movies ever. However, nobody else in my life has ever been willing to spend more than ten minutes watching this movie with me, before they get up and leave the room. So I always end up laughing alone. This movie is weird. The humor is juvenile, but it's funny. Opening scene: while a group of police officers are marching in some kind of formal ceremony, the female cop turns to her male cop partner and says ""I got my period."" He responds with a relieved ""Whew!"" It's funny, but not if you're a person easily offended by off-color jokes.Basically, a group of misfits end up in traffic school together. The legendary Clara Peller (""Where's the Beef?"") has a co-starring role in this movie. She ends up getting caught up in traffic school after she follows an airplane down the tarmac, in her car, while she complains to her companion (actress Nedra Volz) about ""Those stupid buses, they're always in the way!"" Sally Kellerman, who was certainly known for far more prestigious roles, plays a corrupt judge, and to me, this is one of her funniest movies. This was one of actress Jennifer Tilly's early roles. The rest of the cast are mostly unknows, or siblings of far more famous actors, including James Keach, brother of the famous actor Stacy Keach, and John Murray, brother of the far better known comedic actor Bill Murray. ""Moving Violations"" was also a mid-career movie for the comic actor Fred Willard.I think the movie is also particularly funny for anyone who has ever lived in a large city for an extended period of time and had no choice but to take public transportation. If you've ever ridden the bus in Los Angeles , you'll really get this humor, especially when John Murray's character tries mightily to keep his gardening business up and running, while he's taking the bus, since his car was impounded by the corrupt judge (Sally Kellerman) and the corrupt cop (James Keach.) The memory of him trying to lug enormous potted trees onto a crowded bus is enough to make me spit Coca-Cola through my nose, and I've seen this movie at least 50 times over the years.So this isn't Masterpiece Theatre, or even Monty Python, but this movie definitely wasn't intended to be high-brow comedy. In conclusion, I would also offer my opinion that this movie definitely ISN'T worth paying $40 or more for a DVD - it's really not that funny. Catch it on some late-night second-rate cable TV network and DVR it, so you have a copy, but I wouldn't personally spend more than $20 for this DVD, and that would have to include the cost of shipping.",5,"Five stars, if this is your kind of humor...",1373328000,"07 9, 2013",2013,2596,"['Moving', 'Violations', 'one', 'most', 'favorite', 'comedy', 'movies', 'ever', 'However', 'nobody', 'else', 'life', 'ever', 'been', 'willing', 'spend', 'more', 'ten', 'minutes', 'watching', 'movie', 'get', 'up', 'leave', 'room', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'laughing', 'alone', 'movie', 'weird', 'humor', 'juvenile', 'funny', 'Opening', 'scene', 'group', 'police', 'officers', 'are', 'marching', 'kind', 'formal', 'ceremony', 'female', 'cop', 'male', 'cop', 'partner', 'got', 'period', 'relieved', 'Whew', 'funny', 'not', ""'re"", 'person', 'easily', 'offended', 'off-color', 'jokes.Basically', 'group', 'misfits', 'end', 'up', 'traffic', 'school', 'together', 'legendary', 'Clara', 'Peller', 'Where', 'Beef', 'co-starring', 'role', 'movie', 'up', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'traffic', 'school', 'airplane', 'down', 'tarmac', 'car', 'companion', 'actress', 'Nedra', 'Volz', 'stupid', 'buses', ""'re"", 'always', 'way', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'who', 'was', 'certainly', 'known', 'far', 'more', 'prestigious', 'roles', 'corrupt', 'judge', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'was', 'one', 'actress', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'early', 'roles', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'mostly', 'unknows', 'siblings', 'far', 'more', 'famous', 'actors', 'including', 'James', 'Keach', 'brother', 'famous', 'actor', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'John', 'Murray', 'brother', 'far', 'better', 'known', 'comedic', 'actor', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Moving', 'Violations', 'was', 'also', 'mid-career', 'movie', 'comic', 'actor', 'Fred', 'Willard.I', 'think', 'movie', 'also', 'particularly', 'funny', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'large', 'city', 'extended', 'period', 'time', 'had', 'choice', 'take', 'public', 'transportation', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'ridden', 'bus', 'Los', 'Angeles', ""'ll"", 'really', 'get', 'humor', 'especially', 'when', 'John', 'Murray', 'character', 'mightily', 'keep', 'gardening', 'business', 'up', 'running', 'taking', 'bus', 'car', 'was', 'impounded', 'corrupt', 'judge', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'James', 'Keach', 'memory', 'trying', 'lug', 'enormous', 'potted', 'trees', 'crowded', 'bus', 'enough', 'make', 'spit', 'Coca-Cola', 'nose', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'least', '50', 'times', 'years.So', ""n't"", 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'even', 'Monty', 'Python', 'movie', 'definitely', 'was', ""n't"", 'intended', 'be', 'high-brow', 'comedy', 'conclusion', 'would', 'also', 'offer', 'opinion', 'movie', 'definitely', ""N'T"", 'worth', 'paying', '40', 'more', 'DVD', 'really', 'not', 'funny', 'Catch', 'late-night', 'second-rate', 'cable', 'TV', 'network', 'DVR', 'so', 'have', 'copy', 'would', ""n't"", 'personally', 'spend', 'more', '20', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'include', 'cost', 'shipping']",N/A

We never found out about it until the movie came out on cable a couple of years later and we happen to see him in the scene. He's the asian guy with glasses sitting next to John Murray's character (Dana Cannon) when all the other characters in the film are being sentenced to traffic school. They actually exchange glances with each other when Murray is rattling on with one of his smart remarks during the scene. Otherwise, MOVING VIOLATIONS aims for a low brow audience and delivers. A simple and funny plot where various people with multiple traffic violations are sentenced to traffic school and have their vehicles impounded until they pass traffic school. They then band together when they uncover a scam by the police officer (James Keach) giving the traffic school course, to sell the impounded vehicles. They have to stop and expose his plot to the authorities. John Murray's character is a rehash of all characters of the more famous and older sibling Bill, from his previous work in SNL, STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS.
