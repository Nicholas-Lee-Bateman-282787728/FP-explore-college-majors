This video strongly supports the &#34;big bang theory&#34; and that we came from molecules of gas millions and millions of years ago.  I don't agree with that.  It's ok, it gives a lot of information and pictures.  I would not have purchased this if I had known it is totally anti-creation. This video supports the idea that all forms of life, plus water, wind, air, earth, land...all came to be just by chance.  I don't agree.",3,Evolution vs creation,1374105600,"07 18, 2013",2013,537,"['believe', 'Creation', 'video', 'very', 'interesting', 'not', 'MY', 'idea', 'how', 'earth', 'came', 'be', 'video', 'strongly', '34', 'big', 'bang', 'theory', '34', 'came', 'molecules', 'gas', 'millions', 'millions', 'years', 'ago', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'ok', 'lot', 'information', 'pictures', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'purchased', 'had', 'known', 'totally', 'anti-creation', 'video', 'idea', 'forms', 'life', 'water', 'wind', 'air', 'earth', 'land', 'came', 'be', 'just', 'chance', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree']",Faces of Earth

1115614,A12LCVV5RI0ZTH,B000XXWE30,Michael J. Bauers,"[0, 0]","This is about the first video.Which is an attempt to explain the history of earth's geology in one hour.  First off, while the video on mapping the planet using spectroscopy (I think that's what the project was doing) was fascinating, it's wasted time when you are trying to cover the earth's geo history.Then they spend a lot of time on the magnetic field of the Earth.  Again, interesting, but off topic.  Why not cover that in another video?They totally rush through the fascinating question of how proto-planetary systems form and evolve into solar systems (if I use the correct terms.)  There's a lot of interesting info here.As is standard in any geo video, they don't even attempt to explain two important processes.  (1) Why did plates start subducting? (2) How was so much continental crust formed?  I can't knock them for this - I am not sure science knows the answers to these questions.In general, I would prefer a video on this topic stick to a chronological order, and avoid digressing much.  Also, the how the Earth was Made documentary was two hours ( the original documentary, the show was only an hour.)Anyway, as this is an inexpensive video, if you are really interested in geologic origins, I suggest getting the two hour how the earth was made show as well.  That way you get this material presented a few ways.",3,"Some good info, but could be better",1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,1333,"['first', 'video.Which', 'attempt', 'explain', 'history', 'earth', 'geology', 'one', 'hour', 'First', 'off', 'video', 'mapping', 'planet', 'using', 'spectroscopy', 'think', 'what', 'project', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'fascinating', 'wasted', 'time', 'when', 'are', 'trying', 'cover', 'earth', 'geo', 'history.Then', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'magnetic', 'field', 'Earth', 'Again', 'interesting', 'topic', 'Why', 'not', 'cover', 'video', 'totally', 'rush', 'fascinating', 'question', 'how', 'proto-planetary', 'systems', 'form', 'evolve', 'solar', 'systems', 'use', 'correct', 'terms', 'lot', 'interesting', 'info', 'here.As', 'standard', 'geo', 'video', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'attempt', 'explain', 'two', 'important', 'processes', '1', 'Why', 'did', 'plates', 'start', 'subducting', '2', 'How', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'continental', 'crust', 'formed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'knock', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'science', 'answers', 'questions.In', 'general', 'would', 'prefer', 'video', 'topic', 'stick', 'chronological', 'order', 'avoid', 'digressing', 'much', 'Also', 'how', 'Earth', 'was', 'Made', 'documentary', 'was', 'two', 'hours', 'original', 'documentary', 'show', 'was', 'only', 'hour', 'Anyway', 'inexpensive', 'video', 'are', 'really', 'interested', 'geologic', 'origins', 'suggest', 'getting', 'two', 'hour', 'how', 'earth', 'was', 'made', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'get', 'material', 'presented', 'few', 'ways']",Faces of Earth

There might not be life on our planet if certain conditions did not exist. Our planet took three billion years to get prepared for us and every living thing. What a miracle!
