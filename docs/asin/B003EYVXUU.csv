Even the cover for the movie didn't catch me. Anyway, somehow I added it to my wishlist. I got the movie and months later finally decided to try it. I had been expecting worse, so when I saw that it was almost two hours long, I sighed. I wanted to make it quick and watch some other movie. I had been skipping a first few parts in the movie, because I found them uninteresting, boring. Because of pathetic little boy and his miserable life. Anyway I skipped a little in the movie. Until the girl came into the picture. Then it just caught me. I was watching it with questions on my mind, I was hooked by how good the movie actually was. It was thrilling and entertaining and bit of drama as well. I was  upset when it actually ended. I wanted to see a little more.

1339784,A33LLUCE9FZQCF,B003EYVXUU,ACRIMONIOUS,"[2, 3]","At the core of this film, is a love story, however; not in the usual sense, but rather, a story of innocent love, without Eros. A love story, in its simplest, and most complex form. It is indeed unusual, in a vampire film (or film in general) to find a female protagonist, let alone a child, well physically anyway. Without revealing, too much of the plot. Our protagonist, (the undead version of Little Debbie) ""Abby"" (Chloe Moretz) and a creepy middle age man, played flawlessly, by Richard Jenkins. (Whom at first, appears to be the girls father, then later an unsettling and repulsive potential, pedopheliac type. But is ultimately, and rather discretely, revealed to be her non-vampire brother.) Move to a lower middle class apartment complex, in early 80's Los Alamos, New Mexico. Where she encounters, a troubled, pitiful, but endearing, pre-adolescent loner, ""Owen"", played (very, very well) by Kodi Smit McPhee. (Through him, we are reminded what a difficult time prepubescence was. It's funny that a boy whom actually meets a vampire, has more to fear from monsters of the mortal persuasion ie: bullies, and the horrors of inefectual, self absorbed and embattled parents, in the midst of a highly acromonious divorce, than a blood sucking ghoul.)  Well, Abby eventually, develops a crush on the boy. And the obvious complications, of vampire/human interaction become quite evident. However; the age difference (Don't forget, Abby's actual age is likely, that of a middle aged adult) is not a factor. Outwardly she is an innocent child. However; her hunger, or rather her need for blood, is voracious. The paradox of this character is fascinating. Abby keeps asserting that, she is: ""not a girl"", and ""I'm stronger than I look"" (SPOILER ALERT) those are not vampire references, those are actually in reference to the original film, Let The Right One In, in which the character was actually a castrated boy, with feminine features. I don't think, that's the case with Abby. However; it's never specified. (END: SPOILER ALERT) Another interesting thing about Abby, is her lack of desire, to turn those around her (particularly those she cares about) into vampires. She lives quietly, she's not bent on building an army of the night. Which makes sense, as cool as it seems, I'm sure after a while it gets old. She seems to view her vampiristic dispostion as more of a curse than a blessing, at this point. Our story becomes further complicated when Abby's eating habits, and choice of take-out food, inevitably, attract the attention of the local authorities. Which brings us to another excellent performance, by character actor, Elias Koteas as the soft spoken sleuth (police detective) who's a bit of conspiracy theorist. (Those of you old enough, perhaps remember, the media-fueled: Satanic Ritual Abuse Scare of the 80's. 20/20 actually did a feature on it. And Oprah, did an entire show on ""human sacrifice"") Obviously, any film about a vampire has an absurd premise. Yet, the characters here are so convincing, that you actually forget how far-fetched it all seems. My one (petty) criticism is: In the scene where the car stops at the rail-road crossing, unless that vehicle was in park, it would have rolled forward into the train. Also, the typical vampire silliness, is present here. A gross disregard of gravity, superhuman strength, reflective deficiency (and yet, vampires are always so well quaffed) and an acute adverse reaction to sunlight. Mythologicaly, the rules of the vampire legend, are not reinvented here. Yet, the clich&eacute;s make the film no less enjoyable. (And I suppose it's better than having them glisten in the sun, as if covered in glitter, that's just plain stupid. What kind of moron would see a vampire movie where that happens?) This film is anything but a typical vampire tale. This is: a love story, a pre-teen drama, a revenge yarn, an accurate period piece and a dark and dreamy horror movie, all flawlessly executed, in one film, with outstanding acting, and directing. So dim the lights, pour yourself a glass of scotch, or blood, depending on your preference. And enjoy this dark, haunting, engrossing, and most importantly...charming, film.",5,TWILIGHT FOR GROWN UPS,1368057600,"05 9, 2013",2013,4193,"['core', 'film', 'love', 'story', 'however', 'not', 'usual', 'sense', 'rather', 'story', 'innocent', 'love', 'Eros', 'A', 'love', 'story', 'simplest', 'most', 'complex', 'form', 'indeed', 'unusual', 'vampire', 'film', 'film', 'general', 'find', 'female', 'protagonist', 'let', 'alone', 'child', 'well', 'physically', 'anyway', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'protagonist', 'undead', 'version', 'Little', 'Debbie', 'Abby', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'creepy', 'middle', 'age', 'man', 'played', 'flawlessly', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Whom', 'first', 'be', 'girls', 'father', 'then', 'later', 'unsettling', 'repulsive', 'potential', 'pedopheliac', 'type', 'ultimately', 'rather', 'discretely', 'revealed', 'be', 'non-vampire', 'brother', 'Move', 'lower', 'middle', 'class', 'apartment', 'complex', 'early', '80', 'Los', 'Alamos', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Where', 'troubled', 'pitiful', 'endearing', 'pre-adolescent', 'loner', 'Owen', 'played', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'Kodi', 'Smit', 'McPhee', 'are', 'reminded', 'what', 'difficult', 'time', 'prepubescence', 'was', 'funny', 'boy', 'whom', 'actually', 'vampire', 'more', 'fear', 'monsters', 'mortal', 'persuasion', 'ie', 'bullies', 'horrors', 'inefectual', 'self', 'absorbed', 'embattled', 'parents', 'midst', 'highly', 'acromonious', 'divorce', 'blood', 'sucking', 'ghoul', 'Well', 'Abby', 'eventually', 'crush', 'boy', 'obvious', 'complications', 'vampire/human', 'interaction', 'become', 'quite', 'evident', 'However', 'age', 'difference', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Abby', 'actual', 'age', 'likely', 'middle', 'aged', 'adult', 'not', 'factor', 'Outwardly', 'innocent', 'child', 'However', 'hunger', 'rather', 'need', 'blood', 'voracious', 'paradox', 'character', 'fascinating', 'Abby', 'asserting', 'not', 'girl', ""'m"", 'stronger', 'look', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'are', 'not', 'vampire', 'references', 'are', 'actually', 'reference', 'original', 'film', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'character', 'was', 'actually', 'castrated', 'boy', 'feminine', 'features', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'case', 'Abby', 'However', 'never', 'specified', 'END', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'interesting', 'thing', 'Abby', 'lack', 'desire', 'turn', 'particularly', 'vampires', 'quietly', 'not', 'bent', 'building', 'army', 'night', 'Which', 'sense', 'as', 'cool', ""'m"", 'sure', 'while', 'old', 'view', 'vampiristic', 'dispostion', 'more', 'curse', 'blessing', 'point', 'story', 'further', 'complicated', 'when', 'Abby', 'eating', 'habits', 'choice', 'take-out', 'food', 'inevitably', 'attract', 'attention', 'local', 'authorities', 'Which', 'excellent', 'performance', 'character', 'actor', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'soft', 'spoken', 'sleuth', 'police', 'detective', 'who', 'bit', 'conspiracy', 'theorist', 'old', 'enough', 'perhaps', 'remember', 'media-fueled', 'Satanic', 'Ritual', 'Abuse', 'Scare', '80', '20/20', 'actually', 'did', 'feature', 'Oprah', 'did', 'entire', 'show', 'human', 'sacrifice', 'Obviously', 'film', 'vampire', 'absurd', 'premise', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'so', 'convincing', 'actually', 'forget', 'how', 'far-fetched', 'one', 'petty', 'criticism', 'scene', 'where', 'car', 'rail-road', 'crossing', 'vehicle', 'was', 'park', 'would', 'have', 'rolled', 'forward', 'train', 'Also', 'typical', 'vampire', 'silliness', 'present', 'here', 'A', 'gross', 'disregard', 'gravity', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'reflective', 'deficiency', 'yet', 'vampires', 'are', 'always', 'so', 'well', 'quaffed', 'acute', 'adverse', 'reaction', 'sunlight', 'Mythologicaly', 'rules', 'vampire', 'legend', 'are', 'not', 'reinvented', 'here', 'clich', 'eacute', 'make', 'film', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'suppose', 'better', 'having', 'glisten', 'sun', 'covered', 'glitter', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'What', 'kind', 'moron', 'would', 'see', 'vampire', 'movie', 'where', 'film', 'anything', 'typical', 'vampire', 'tale', 'love', 'story', 'pre-teen', 'drama', 'revenge', 'yarn', 'accurate', 'period', 'piece', 'dark', 'dreamy', 'horror', 'movie', 'flawlessly', 'executed', 'one', 'film', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'directing', 'So', 'lights', 'pour', 'glass', 'scotch', 'blood', 'depending', 'preference', 'enjoy', 'dark', 'haunting', 'engrossing', 'most', 'importantly', 'charming', 'film']",N/A
1339785,A3JXPMX8E59PL1,B003EYVXUU,Adam B. Krenn,"[9, 13]","A fan of the original film and novel, I initially had no real desire to see this one. I read so many positive reviews (and the fact it came up on instant view from my online movie provider)that I decided to give this one a try. Here are some of my questions/issues:Initially, why the remake? Not sure. The original film is also a very recent film and is available both dubbed and with subtitles. They are both period pieces in a sense, so their is no reason to update it. I initially read Matt Reeves pay lip service to the original only to go on and say he could do better (not in so few words). Seems like hubris to me. I honestly feel Matt Reeves never understood what the original film was about.As a film, on it's own, it is just uneven. I know some reviewers complain that the comparisons to the original is unfair but truth be told, as a separate entity this film just falls flat, although not due to the performance of the two leads. The pacing felt off, their relationship felt forced at first and the aforementioned manipulation/sympathy dynamic just didn't play out as horror and I felt we were supposed to be cheering for Abby and Owen although we shouldn't be, as Abby certainly was no victim in this film.As a comparison? The original lacks (as far as I know) any CGI work and everything is done on camera with minimal effects (***Edit*** Have re-watched the original, the cats attacking scene was CGI). Many of the original scenes play out and I really felt witness to the events unfolding before me. This version, the CGI stuck out in this supposedly straight forward film and the hospital burning scene felt like it was crow-barred in to have some action (although this scene is in the original, it plays out well as part of a sub-plot). I felt like I was watching a movie, which of course, I was but an intimate story like this should take you away from that point of view. This movie just didn't do that nearly as effectively as the original. There is some good here. Some of the scenes were very well done but, sadly, no more so than they appeared in the original which to say, I simply mean Matt Reeves few good scenes were just carbon copies of the originals. Finally, and already mentioned, Abby was no victim in this film. We are meant to see her as victim because she is a twelve year old girl, but she is clearly not through her actions and behaviors. Eli and Osker, at the core of the original, were both victims that found each other in a sea of garbage, poor Owen is just the next benefactor.The main issue is (as I have read from other reviewers)that Matt Reeves changed the fundamental basis of the story. Not only did he make Abby far less sympathetic but the film tries to continue to create sympathy despite the fact that we should be horrified that Abby is continuing to bully/seduce/entrap Owen in much more subtle ways than the school bullies. Although Abby cared for her old benefactor, this is also another huge departure from the original. Without going into detail, Eli was as much a victim in many ways as Oskar was, unlike the Abby/Owen dynamic. While this makes a better 'horror' film, it ignores what the original was about, not to mention the audio/soundtrack cues really played against this.Some of the logic lapses of the lone cop character were just silly. I understand Matt Reeves was trying to compact the story but it ended up ultimately hurting (in my opinion) it overall, making the film much more conventional, something the original film and book cannot be accused of.Ultimately it is my hope that anyone interested in this film will seek out the original and be exposed to a far better interpretation of the novel and, in turn, seek that out as well.",2,Less sympathetic and unnecessary remake of a far superior film.,1319846400,"10 29, 2011",2011,3707,"['fan', 'original', 'film', 'novel', 'initially', 'had', 'real', 'desire', 'see', 'one', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'fact', 'came', 'up', 'instant', 'view', 'online', 'movie', 'provider', 'decided', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'Here', 'are', 'questions/issues', 'Initially', 'why', 'remake', 'Not', 'sure', 'original', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'recent', 'film', 'available', 'dubbed', 'subtitles', 'are', 'period', 'pieces', 'sense', 'reason', 'update', 'initially', 'read', 'Matt', 'Reeves', 'pay', 'lip', 'service', 'original', 'only', 'go', 'say', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'not', 'so', 'few', 'words', 'hubris', 'honestly', 'feel', 'Matt', 'Reeves', 'never', 'understood', 'what', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'about.As', 'film', 'own', 'just', 'uneven', 'know', 'reviewers', 'complain', 'comparisons', 'original', 'unfair', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'separate', 'entity', 'film', 'just', 'flat', 'not', 'due', 'performance', 'two', 'leads', 'pacing', 'felt', 'off', 'relationship', 'felt', 'forced', 'first', 'aforementioned', 'manipulation/sympathy', 'dynamic', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'out', 'horror', 'felt', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'cheering', 'Abby', 'Owen', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'Abby', 'certainly', 'was', 'victim', 'film.As', 'comparison', 'original', 'lacks', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'CGI', 'work', 'everything', 'done', 'camera', 'minimal', 'effects', '***Edit***', 'Have', 're-watched', 'original', 'cats', 'attacking', 'scene', 'was', 'CGI', 'Many', 'original', 'scenes', 'play', 'really', 'felt', 'witness', 'events', 'unfolding', 'version', 'CGI', 'stuck', 'out', 'supposedly', 'straight', 'forward', 'film', 'hospital', 'burning', 'scene', 'felt', 'was', 'crow-barred', 'have', 'action', 'scene', 'original', 'out', 'well', 'part', 'sub-plot', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'course', 'was', 'intimate', 'story', 'should', 'take', 'away', 'point', 'view', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'nearly', 'as', 'effectively', 'original', 'good', 'here', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'sadly', 'more', 'so', 'appeared', 'original', 'say', 'simply', 'mean', 'Matt', 'Reeves', 'few', 'good', 'scenes', 'were', 'just', 'carbon', 'copies', 'originals', 'Finally', 'already', 'mentioned', 'Abby', 'was', 'victim', 'film', 'are', 'meant', 'see', 'victim', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'clearly', 'not', 'actions', 'behaviors', 'Eli', 'Osker', 'core', 'original', 'were', 'victims', 'found', 'other', 'sea', 'garbage', 'poor', 'Owen', 'just', 'next', 'benefactor.The', 'main', 'issue', 'have', 'read', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Matt', 'Reeves', 'changed', 'fundamental', 'basis', 'story', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'make', 'Abby', 'far', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'film', 'continue', 'create', 'sympathy', 'fact', 'should', 'be', 'horrified', 'Abby', 'continuing', 'bully/seduce/entrap', 'Owen', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'ways', 'school', 'bullies', 'Abby', 'cared', 'old', 'benefactor', 'also', 'huge', 'departure', 'original', 'going', 'detail', 'Eli', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'victim', 'many', 'ways', 'Oskar', 'was', 'Abby/Owen', 'dynamic', 'better', ""'horror"", 'film', 'what', 'original', 'was', 'about', 'not', 'mention', 'audio/soundtrack', 'really', 'played', 'this.Some', 'logic', 'lapses', 'lone', 'cop', 'character', 'were', 'just', 'silly', 'understand', 'Matt', 'Reeves', 'was', 'trying', 'compact', 'story', 'ended', 'up', 'ultimately', 'hurting', 'opinion', 'overall', 'making', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'conventional', 'something', 'original', 'film', 'book', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'accused', 'of.Ultimately', 'hope', 'anyone', 'interested', 'film', 'will', 'seek', 'out', 'original', 'be', 'exposed', 'far', 'better', 'interpretation', 'novel', 'turn', 'seek', 'out', 'as', 'well']",N/A
1339786,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,B003EYVXUU,a,"[1, 4]","Not having seen the original Swedish take on this film, I approached ""Let Me In"" as one would a typical horror film in this post-Twilight world.  I was very impressed by the quality of the acting, the special effects, and the thoroughly engaging plot.  Others have pointed out that this film lacks genuine ""scares,"" and that is true.  If one is expecting a traditional horror film where teenagers are butchered roughly every ten to fifteen minutes, this is not the movie you are searching for.Instead, I actually found the occasional violence of this film much more intense and disturbing.  This film has a sense of reality about it, lacking nearly all of the cliches of the horror genre.  Thus, when there is blood -- and yes, there is a lot of it -- it does not feel gratuitous or necessary.  It feels real, and your loyalties are torn between the killer and the victim because these are three-dimensional characters richly defined in a dark world drenched in a kind of melancholy haze.  My wife, who is a serious ""Twilight"" fan, awarded this three stars, declaring that it was a good vampire flick but nowhere near as beautiful or as magical as the adventures of Bella and Edward.  I rate it slightly higher, finding ""Let Me In"" to be mature, touching, and disturbing.  It leaves questions lingering in the air like smoke as the credits roll, and like all really good films, it leaves me wanting more.There are several special features included such as a behind-the-scenes segment, a very interesting special effects breakdown, a commentary track, and a handful of rather painful deleted scenes better left out of the film.

This American remake does what most American remakes do with a much better filmed foreign original: copies it nearly scene-for-scene, makes a point of removing anything unpalatable to the less sophisticated audience, and ensures the complete absence of any of those tricky, hard-to-read subtitles that so perplex the uneducated. The choice to make the vampire make-up conform to every other Hollywood version was a bad one, it lost all the depth and eeriness that the original had and really seemed to help make this film more two-dimensional than it should have been.

I'm not a fan of the Twilight movies or anything closely related to them. Something about it seemed a little intriguing so I took a chance on it. OMG! Where has this movie been all my life!? This is definitely not aimed at the Twilight viewer. This was one of the best vampire movies I have ever seen. I hesitate to even qualify it as a vampire movie. Yes she is a vampire, but there are so many layers to this movie. It is scary at times, and very moving at others. Kodi Smit-McPhee is so good in his role, you really just want to hug him and tell him everything will be okay. Chloe Moretz also does an excellent job in her role (she is starring as Carrie in the remake). Did anyone notice that they never show the moms face in the movie? It was kinda strange and intriguing. And I don't want to spoil anything but pretty much everything you want to happen in the movie does. So that is quite different to have a happy ending in a scary movie. My husband was so excited that I found this unexpected gem of a movie. We are definitely putting it in our Halloween movie rotation. I don't know why this movie didn't get more publicity. Maybe it did and I somehow missed it, but I am so happy that I found it and I would recommend this to anyone! Vampire fan or not, you will love the story.

In both movies the actors are great, I really admired their roles. But for me the end in the last one Let Me in, took out all the meaning of them being together. Yes it was dramatic when you see the kid been pull out from the lockers like a dog, and him running for the knife trying to find something to defend himself, yes it make me feel sorry for him, that's it, it was just one more story of a bully and his victim to me. Gave the idea that he was expecting that to happen, it didn't took him by surprise at all. In the original, the kid is swimming and having so much fun, his smile is so innocent and real, like a little boy will be that I just feel outrageous when this others kids harass him and the betray is even more painful to watch. Even his child response that he won't be able to hold breathing for that long, the sign of fear slowly painting in his face understanding that this time the bullies are going far, I find it more hurtful than the blank face of fear that the other kid have. And for me they miss the connection, how does a child decided to leave everything to be with this little pretty creepy monster at all without the rescue. The emotional connection is lost, he get's out from the water himself! As in the original it seems to be at first that some diabolical entity that nobody sees at first is dismembering everybody around the pool, and he is oblivious to what is happening outside, weakening as he tries to hold his breath, but when she extend her hands and pull him out of the water, the way he smiles back to her, as it was an angel that has save him, it make sense to me then that he will go after her for the rest of his life. In the last one, the kids is  not surprise to see her, and keeps his face of fear and there is no thankful look at all from him.

The original film was based in Blackeberg, Stockholm but the in the American version the action has shifted to a small town in New Mexico. Director Matt Reeves has chosen the year 1980 as the year in which things unfold, this has to do with the Reagan American thought process of the time of good and evil, communism. There is Owen (Kodi Smith- Mcphee) who is fighting his own fight with the school bullies, he is terrorized every day. He is lonely and friendless, it is during this time that a young girl Abby, a 250 year old vampire, according to the original book (Chloe Grace Moretz) moves next door to him and they begin an unlikely friendship which will change their lives forever.I would not go in to details about the films pace and events as I think it would give away the story but this is in short, a very remarkable film about loneliness, finding friendship and companionship in the most unlikely places. The pace is slow and the director has not relied on sounds and CGI to bring the story to life. The horror is very subtle and the acting is amazing, two gifted young children have given such a good performance that it would give many grown up actors a run for their money. The cinematography is splendid and so are the other supporting actors. Nothing has changed from the original film; the soul is still intact only the setting has changed with a few minor changes.

The casting could not have been more spot on. Both of the young actors are amazing.I think to some main stream American movie watchers this film may be to slow and lead to some jumped conclusions about quality and overall appeal. Maybe this is where I was confused. It is a somewhat slow paced movie, but that's okay because it works. It doesn't need to be a fast paced, everything blows up, type of movie. It's a very contained movie and has so much emotional impact.After thinking about it I do fully appreciate this movie.

Anyway, you can see the indecent haste with which the American production followed the Swedish - but this time the remake does have its charms - particularly in the young cast chosen. Chloe Moretz (Abby) and Cody Smit-McPhee (Owen) work  very well together - and casting generally is excellent - so the band of bullies who make Owen's life miserable are completely convincing. So is their demise, I guess!What an interesting actor Cody Smit-Mcphee is!

Take your Twilight DVDs and throw them into the garbage where they belong. Time to graduate from grade school and move right in with the upper class. Let Me In is the vampire movie that real vampire movie fans have been wanting for years. (Before I continue I just want to apologize to the fans of Twilight. I mean no offense. I'm only saying, in a humorous way, that Let Me In is in no way Twilight.)Some of you may already know this but Let Me In is a remake of a Swedish film ""Let the Right One In."" For those of you who may have seen this I'm sure you won't be disappointed with Let Me In. With the exception of a few scenes, Let Me In stays true to the original. The few scenes that were changed were mostly do to cultural difference or confusing segments. Let Me In is neither better nor worse, it's just an Americanized version of a very good movie.For those who didn't know of or see the original, you're in for a treat. I wouldn't call this a horror film, but more of a dramatic thriller. It follows a young boy named Owen, a skinny, shy, socially awkward twelve year old. His young life is in shambles: his parents are divorcing, he doesn't have any friends, and he's being bullied in school. The only thing in his life that makes him happy are Now & Laters. But then Abby moves in next door, a mysterious young girl who finds Owen just as curious as he finds her. They slowly strike up a friendship, and through her Owen starts to take a little bit of control in his life. Yet something doesn't seem right about Abby, and Owen must decide if he wants to let that get in the way of his friendship with the young girl Abby.Let Me In doesn't pull many punches in terms of content. It is brutal and bloody. It has quite a few mature situations. And it carries with every scene a brooding and dark atmosphere. I guess that's to be expected though when it comes to real vampire films.I can highly recommend this movie to any fan of quality horror or thriller films.

The description didn't seem particularly enticing because it didn't reveal very much, but none of that matters now.  I made the decision to watch the movie anyway and it paid off wonderfully.  It's about a little kid around 12 who gets picked on by bullies at school and after school when it's dark and cold outside, he frequently meets up with (and eventually befriends) a demon girl his own age who has a craving for blood unbeknownst to the boy.  They hit off a friendship that's one of the more unusual ways to develop one, haha.What makes Let Me In work so well is how it perfectly blends sad emotions with just the right touch of orchestration in the soundtrack, and combines these feelings with the surprise and gruesome factor of the horror genre with tons of bloody, violent and unpredictable murders thanks to the demon girls neverending pursuit for blood.  Seems like a bad combination on paper doesn't it?  Well somehow, I loved it.  It's an odd combination, and at first I wasn't sure it'd even work but after watching the entire thing, I'm left to believe the writing is top-notch, intelligent and compelling.  The storyline flows with such ease that the only time you're really lost is right after the boy meets the demon girl and the girl ventures on her own for a little while.  However, everything eventually falls into place and makes sense.The bullies are exceptionally vicious and unforgiving, but that just makes the ending even better.  That basically covers what the film is about.  Might have to turn the volume up high however, because there's tons of whispering between the boy and girl.  It's really amazing just how much of a connection the two of them have.

1339812,AT57B36BHDQ00,B003EYVXUU,Big Mike,"[5, 8]","I have to say that Let Me In worked on several different levels for me. It is mainly touted as a horror film about vampires but despite all of the necessary blood and gore it comes through as a very touching love story. It also well-captures the pains of growing up, facing bullying at school, loneliness, isolation and first love. The two young leads, Kodi Smit-McPhee as Owen and Chlo Grace Moretz as Abby are equally magnificent. It was interesting to note that Owen's mother was never actually shown except in very brief glimpses, ala the way the Peanuts cartoons used to depict adults. With the exceptions of a few other adults the children seemed to mostly carry the film. Let Me In is such a unique addition to the horror and vampire genres. It holds its own exceptionally well against the original Swedish version, Let the Right One In. The Americanization of the story only adds another dimension. The New Mexico filming locations also added much to the feel and the atmosphere of the story, making it feel cold, isolated and uninviting. Stephen King called it ""the best American horror film for the last 20 years"". It may not be the best but it certainly is one of them. I found myself pulling for Owen and Abby to be together and I loved the ending, although I would have liked for the story to go on longer. Some have said that maybe the whole story was just a dream or a daydream of Owen's to help him cope with his unhappy life. Interesting theory, but I would like to think that wasn't the case. Anyway, the film ends without any such idea being revealed and thankfully does not take the time and effort to explain anything further.

Of course there's blood - it's a vampire movie, after all.  But it's primarily a first-love story about the friendship between a pre-teen boy and girl - it's just that she turns out to be a vampire. It's a moody piece: Young Owen is a lonely, bullied boy who meets Abby, his new next-door neighbor who has moved in one evening with her adult companion - who is not her father, it turns out, and does her bidding by helping find her victims. The two young actors who play them are excellent: Kodi-Smit McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz already have some serious film cred, having appeared in ""The Road"" and ""Kick-Ass"", respectively.  Richard Jenkins, who was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Visitor"", seems to be making a career of playing world-weary characters, and he is excellent too, as always.

That says enough about how much it impacted nearly everyone, and not just myself.I will re-write this review later, but at the moment I'm kind of in shock. Once you see ""Edit:"" toward the bottom then I will have finally given this film a proper/accurate review. For now even tho I have seen it several times I am mainly speaking about the characters and such, and it's just rambling unless you really want to know about the Actors/Actresses as I have not been able to think of the words to put together to describe the film, or Chloe's acting ability.Chloe Moretz... That girl can ACT! She is one awesome little Vampire in this film, and her emotional/facial expressions are so accurate that it's kind of surreal seeing someone near her age with her abilities. She even did all of her stunts in ""Kick-AXX"", and that did not look like an easy task.I guess as boring as this review seems, I really connected with the characters. It has it's own way of being REALLY sweet & a cute film. Not ""cute"" in the small way, but cute as in I am buying this in Blu even tho I've seen it (I believe) 5 times.The boy in this film was just as spot on with his character as Chloe, but Chloe adds something unique. The Son of ""Jack"" in the showLost: The Complete Collection [Blu-ray] was the bad guy in this film. That disappointed me quite a bit to see them toss him into a selfish & mean roll. He has all of the potential to be a great Actor, but I think he may have needed to not play this roll because of how people can permanently view a new Actor or Actress from 1 bad roll, and see them as that bad (or good) person forever. He's going to have to go toward a division to show he is kind, and not arrogant before jumping into such a hateful roll. It wasn't his fault of course. I wouldn't have said ""No"" either if they asked me to play the part. I wouldn't have had the patience and would think ""If I pass up this roll I may never get another again"". So, I understand, but it stinks they've put him in a position where they literally may have to let him age for 3-5 more years before putting him in another film so the audience will have a fresh take on his Character. I believe he will succeed in the industry, but may need to be careful about which rolls to take. Chloe showed her good and sweet sides before she tried to show the audience ""Profession"" in the manner of some films. A lot of people will be disgusted to hear her speak with a bad mouth in another film in particular. It took me watchingKick-Ass (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)& watching the interview to understand this girl is truly an ""Actress"", and tho I don't feel comfortable with anyone at that age being allowed by their parents to speak that way in a film... she was phenomenal. She is truly a Star. Hollywood isn't about to let Chloe go. She is probably a Gold Mine to the industry. It seems she is the lead actress in every film she is in now. Yeah, there wasHome Alone, and I Love the movieMy Girl, and that shows young people can act, but Chloe takes things to a whole different level.I'll stop rambling, because I really am still a bit speechless ATM to explain about this film directly other than I'm genuinely amazed by this girl's acting abilities, and the ability to be so powerful with her acting that she can turn a very bad film Very good.Watching her interview I thought ""THAT'S why she seems so down to earth, to me!"" when she mentioned she was born in Georgia until Chloe's Brother was accepted into an acting school in New York, and her and her Mom talked about acting and Chloe just went and did it. She had 0 experience before her first film in any acting scenario. She makes an Alabamian proud :)Dakota FanningSteven Spielberg Presents TakenI believe would lose very bad against Chloe's acting, and that is saying a LOT, for me. I genuinely believe no one could have possibly done as spot on of a job as she did in ""Taken"". Dakota is sweet, but the industry has gauged her directly at very melodramatic rolls. Lots of screaming inWar of the Worlds [Blu-ray], and she was absolutely awesome inMan On Fire [Blu-ray] with Denzell Washington, but then again Dakota was put in a position where a lot of areas are trying to show her ability to act out pure sadness. That's great, and she did great, but they did put her in a roll that had quite a bit of whining in this one as well. Also, this was not her fault, and I genuinely don't think another girl at that time could have possibly played the entire roll so well. (All of my spelling is probably wrong. I apologize)Then again we could say the same about Chloe, because Chloe was inKick-Ass (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)& if you aren't prepared to see a little girl speak like an adult with a dirty mouth then you wont think of Chloe as sweet. The 1st time I watched it I was kind of nauseated because I have a Niece that is so much like her, and just couldn't imagine her speaking that way. Watch the interview of Chloe on the subject film ""Kick-XXX"" thru youtube to get a better understanding of her personality. Chloe doesn't just smile, or cry, or laugh, act sweet, or mean... She does it All, and very well. She can do any acting scenario I can think of.I will edit this out & make it more proper in a little while, but I definitely wanted to add another 5 star review.

When I first started watching this film, the mood and direction reminded me of that series quite a bit, which caught my attention.I also screened the original ""Let the Right One In,"" which I really liked.  But I liked this film even more.  I think that it came down to the acting for me; the leads in this film I thought were just better than the leads in the foreign film.  But both films are excellent so you really can't go wrong either way.I could go on and on about the plot, but I find that a little boring.  I would rather discuss what I believed this film was trying to say.  Or rather make that, what question was this film asking of the viewer.  For me, what I thought about was this:  what would I be willing to do for love?  How far would I be willing to go?The setup in this movie was terrific in the sense that, even though the Chloe Moretz character could be argued as evil (I don't think that I'm giving anything away there) you can completely understand why the Kodi Smit-McPhee character was still in ""love"" with her.  (You might be tempted to argue, ""They're too young to be in love,"" and you might have a point.  But I'm not much interested in semantics here so call it what you will.)  He's a loner, she may as well be a loner, and they both have something that the other needs.  And they both connect and understand each other in some fairly unexpected ways.It has been a while since I've seen this, but I've seen it twice.  From what I remember, there is a scene where Mr. McPhee was sitting in class while they were discussing the film ""Romeo and Juliet.""

There had only been maybe a year or two since the original came out and Hollywood often ruins many of the remakes of foreign films they do (most of the asian horror ones except for maybe ""The Ring""). What at first looked like a cheap attempt to cash-in from the success of the original actually turns out to be a good and faithful adaption of the Swedish film and the novel of the same name. The lead actors Kodi Smit-McPhee(The Road)and Chloe Moretz(Kick-Ass) both give good well-acted performances as the characters of the boy Owen and the vampire girl Abby. The film is essentially the same storyline as the original and comes close to a shot by shot remake however making it work (Unlike the remake of ""Psycho""). This film offers superb cinematography as well as a well thought out script and music score. The only real weakness Let Me In has is the use of cgi during scenes where Abby is attacking her victims.

Thankfully, writer/director Matt Reeves manages to pull together an equally beautiful film that retains the heart and soul of the original in its overall mood and aesthetic. LET ME IN follows Owen, a shy boy who is constantly tormented by his peers. When a strange young girl moves in next door, the two bond out of their shared loneliness to form a close friendship. What Owen doesn't know is that his new playmate is an ageless vampire, and that she is sustaining herself on the blood of their neighbors. Reeves uses the same drained color palette and restrained shooting style that can be found in Alfredson's film, filling each scene with cold blues and muted browns in order to give LET ME IN a bleak but timeless look and feel. Its story and characters share the same level of warmth and depth from before, brought over from the portion of John Ajvide Lindqvist's original screenplay that was left intact. This would have meant nothing without the stellar leads played by Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Moretz, who bring the characters to life with a pair of incredible performances from such young actors. With few exceptions, LET ME IN also remains as subtle and effective as LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, however there are a few moments that have been cheapened through the unnecessary use of computerization. These minor trespasses are easier to overlook when Reeves has gone to such great lengths to honor and respect the film's source material. In the end, LET ME IN proves to be one of the most confident and skillful remakes to come out in recent years, yet it still begs the question ""Why?"" when so little has been changed.

It balances the right amount of eerie softness between the young main characters with an underlying sense of chilling terror. It grabs you and takes you in; makes the story between a tweleve-year old victim of bullying and a young (looking) vampire girl believeable and real.Owen, the center character of the movie, is a young boy going through the rough divorce of his parents, while having to deal with three bullies terrorizing him at school. The scenes of bullying in this movie are pretty graphic, and right from the start makes you feel for Owen. Just when things seem to get more dismal for the boy, he meets Abby, our other lead role.Abby is down right terrifying; makes you want to crawl under your sheets and never come out (at least, when she's in vampire mode). Mortez is amazing in every role she plays, no doubt, but she really shined for me in this film. Abby teaches Owen to stand up for himself as they form an awkward relationship that turns from friendship into something more.This film is electrifying and chilling at the same time, giving you mixed feelings about Abby and her girl-by-day, murderous-vampire-by-night role. It also makes me wonder how vampire movies and culture have twisted into what they are today (ahem, Twilight...), and why every vampire movie isn't like this one.Watch this movie, now!",5,A chilling coming-of-age horror that will shake you,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,1402,"['Let', 'Me', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'right', 'amount', 'eerie', 'softness', 'young', 'main', 'characters', 'underlying', 'sense', 'chilling', 'terror', 'story', 'tweleve-year', 'old', 'victim', 'bullying', 'young', 'looking', 'vampire', 'girl', 'believeable', 'real.Owen', 'center', 'character', 'movie', 'young', 'boy', 'going', 'rough', 'divorce', 'parents', 'having', 'deal', 'three', 'bullies', 'terrorizing', 'school', 'scenes', 'bullying', 'movie', 'are', 'pretty', 'graphic', 'right', 'start', 'feel', 'Owen', 'Just', 'when', 'things', 'seem', 'get', 'more', 'dismal', 'boy', 'Abby', 'other', 'lead', 'role.Abby', 'down', 'right', 'terrifying', 'want', 'crawl', 'sheets', 'never', 'come', 'out', 'least', 'when', 'vampire', 'mode', 'Mortez', 'amazing', 'role', 'doubt', 'really', 'shined', 'film', 'Abby', 'Owen', 'stand', 'up', 'form', 'awkward', 'relationship', 'friendship', 'something', 'more.This', 'film', 'electrifying', 'chilling', 'same', 'time', 'giving', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'Abby', 'girl-by-day', 'murderous-vampire-by-night', 'role', 'also', 'wonder', 'how', 'vampire', 'movies', 'culture', 'have', 'twisted', 'what', 'are', 'today', 'ahem', 'Twilight', 'why', 'vampire', 'movie', ""n't"", 'one.Watch', 'movie', 'now']",N/A

I was kind of hoping for an exact shot for shot remake like Funny Games, even though that would be completely pointless.  Let Me In does make enough minor changes to give the story a bit of a new feel, although much is lost in comparison.  Even though it infuses more violence and graphic images, it somehow loses nearly all of the visceral impact the original conveyed.Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass) does a tremendous job as Abby, the mysterious new girl in town that only comes out at night.  I also enjoyed watching Kodi Smit-McPhee (The Road) as Owen, the lonely boy that gets bullied at school.  The two make a strange connection and rely on each other for support.All the great scenes from the original are duplicated here--the murder in the woods, the feeding in the tunnel, the swimming pool slaughter.  The differences are pretty drastic though, regardless of the extra blood or more frantic feel.  They all fall well short of the intensity and suspense from The Right One.  There are some additional moments that include flesh burning and frozen corpses that are worth mentioning.It's always good to see a quality horror film be embraced and supported on the big screen.

1339836,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003EYVXUU,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 10]","""Let Me In"" is every bit as unnerving, absorbing, tragic, touching, and compelling as ""Let the Right One In,"" the 2008 Swedish horror film on which it's based. This is remarkable given all the ways it could have gone wrong, which is really an underhanded way of saying all the ways it could have been Americanized. The original film, and the novel on which it was based, was a vampire story in the strictest sense, but is wasn't a two-hour ordeal of tired vampire clich&eacute;s like crucifixes and garlic; rather, it was a reserved, disturbing peek into the lives of two lonely kids, one of whom just happens to be a vampire. The remake, despite the conversion from Swedish to English, gives us the exact same peek, which was a wise move on writer/director Matt Reeves' part since it allows the audience to connect to the story on a more emotional level.Indeed, the story is one of deep, primal emotions - isolation, neglect, fear, uncertainty, and, in its own disturbing way, love. This isn't to suggest that the film romanticizes the leads. That would not only be inappropriate given their ages, it would also ruin the suspense the story builds, for it's a convention used in far too many vampire movies. When I say love, I'm referring to the deep seeded need these kids share for some kind of attachment, some sense that someone out there actually cares for them. Despite vast differences in age and category of species, the two are very much alike. The boy, twelve-year-old Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee), has no friends, is mercilessly bullied in school, and lives in a broken him, his parents divorced and his father no longer in the picture. The vampire, Abby (Chlo Grace Moretz), who has been twelve for a very long time, is forced to move from place to place and cannot get close with anyone. Her only companion is an older man (Richard Jenkins) who roams the city streets in search of unwilling blood donors.The film, which takes place in Los Alamos, New Mexico during the winter of 1983, shows Owen and Abby finding solace in each other's company. Owen doesn't initially know what Abby is. Why does she smell funny? Why does she walk barefoot through the snow? Why is she only seen at night? Why does she have to be invited into someone's home? And what could she possibly means by asking him, ""Would you like me even if I wasn't a girl?"" When he finally learns the truth, he hardly seems bothered or even surprised by it; perhaps his unfortunate family and academic circumstances have permanently numbed him. When Abby learns of the abuse he endures at school, she encourages him to hit back, and if the bullies persist, then he must simply hit harder. Indeed, the bullies are just this side of sadistic, subjecting him to the kind of psychical and psychological torment exhibited by sociopaths. When Owen whacks one of the boys across the head with a stick during a field trip, severely gashing his ear, it's only natural that we should feel immensely satisfied.One of the more interesting symbolic approaches to Owen's emotional neglect was keeping his mother's face hidden throughout the entire film. Whenever she's in a scene, the camera is angled so that only her body is revealed; if we do see her head, it's either hidden in shadow, shot at a distance, obstructed by an object, or filmed from the back. Even her driver's license photo is obscured by an official seal stamped into the plastic. Perhaps the divorce was too much for her to handle. Or perhaps she's too devoutly religious. In any case, if there is any love between mother and son, it has clearly been stripped to the barest of expressions. We're not meant to see this woman as a mother. We're barely meant to see her as a person.I suppose I should address the film's violence. Strangely enough, this leads me to this year's comic book adaptation ""Kick-Ass,"" in which Chlo Grace Moretz played a young vigilante superhero groomed by her father to be an unstoppable killing machine. I found the film reprehensible, in large part because a murderous eleven-year-old girl was depicted as something to be laughed at. A commenter on my review named Jason Bean posed an interesting question: How is it that ""Let the Right One In"" can be considered a work of art and ""Kick-Ass"" can be considered deplorable, especially when both feature children murdering people? The answer is simple: ""Let the Right One In,"" and likewise this American remake, doesn't treat violence as dismissible, emotionless camp; instead, it's treated as shocking, horrific acts of brutality. ""Let Me In"" is not the kind of film that gives you permission to laugh. Laughter would be a sign that you were never meant to see it.There have been countless American remakes of foreign horror films. ""Let Me In"" is one of the few that deserves recognition. It stays true to its source without merely spitting it back at us with English-speaking actors; Reeves adds his own unique touches to the story, allowing it to stand apart from the original Swedish film. The greatest achievement of both versions of the film was the willingness to sidestep many of the overused vampire clich&eacute;s most have grown weary of; it's not a supernatural thriller so much as an unsettling examination of two lonely souls. This glimpse into the dark side of friendship makes it even more frightening, I believe, than most of what passes as a horror movie these days. Why waste your time on an empty teen slasher film when you have movies like this at your disposal?",4,A Tormented Boy Befriends a Lonely Vampire,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,5483,"['Let', 'Me',

(In fact I can't recall ever seeing barefoot vampire girls in the snow. Lugosi's girls may have been barefoot, but they were always in the cellar of the castle wandering around the coffins.) The relationship between the girl and her caretaker ( way to go, Mr. Jenkins!) was interesting and I'm sure started out similar to the two teen leads. We seldom go to films but this was one very satisfying especially since the story of a teen vamp and company can be appealing to my demographic. Did I want to BE a vampire when I was 13?

1339841,A1JUF6RWAIAFY1,B003EYVXUU,Cool Breeze,"[15, 21]","Like many who were fortunate enough to see the the fantastic Swedish film, 'Let the Right One In' I was a little more than annoyed at Hollywood for allowing only a scant two years to pass before attempting to remake this film. If they were going to remake this film, they should have let at little more time pass by, especially since they were going to remake a film that was considered by fans and critics to be a masterpiece, and possibly one of the greatest horror films that has ever been made. Couldn't they have waited  another 5, maybe 10 years so that the original could actually settle in and take its place in the pantheon of horror movie classics. No. Hollywood, in its incessant drive to horde as much money as possible, decided to commit sacrilege and go ahead with its' remake anyway.However as the premiere for the movie approached, and the glowing reviews began to stream in, I was intrigued.  Was it possible for 'Let Me In' to be in the same class as 'Let the Right One In?'  Is the child actress from 'Kick Ass' really that great, and is the kid from 'The Road' really that affecting as Owen, the boy who is brutally bullied without impunity by his three tormentors.  After seeing the film, I grudgingly have to say yes.'Let Me In' is just as good a movie as 'Let the Right One In'. 'Let Me In' is very faithful to the original in many ways, but the new director, Matt Reeves, does inject some of his own vision into his adaptation of the brilliant book that this movie is based on. First, the violence and emotion in 'Let Me In' is a lot more visceral and aggressive than it was in the original film. Matt Reeves films most of his movie through closeups, and when a violent act is committed or a person is suffering emotionally, the film goer is impacted more forcefully. Chloe Moretz's(Hitgirl from Kickass) character in the film embodies this films aggression. She is the vampire who charms people with her 12 year old facade, but when she is hungry for blood, she morphs into a crazed killing machine. Abby kills without reservation because it is in her nature to do so. And when she kills in this film she freaking kills.  She rips skin, she breaks bones, and emits a banshee like wail while doing the deed. There are more scenes in this film that illustrate this movie's more aggressive take on the source material than the original film, and this may offend some people. But the aggressive nature of this film appealed to a different side of my sensibility.The great thing about both of these movies is the focus on the relationship that develops between two very lonely people. Abby, the vampire, is a 250 year old being who is trapped inside the body of a 12 year old girl.  Owen, as I've stated above, is a 12 year boy who is mercilessly bullied at school, ignored by his mother, and is emotionally disconnected from his father. Abby and Owen suffer through an oppressive loneliness because of their respective situations.  When they find each other on a cold night in a desolate town in New Mexico, a relationship between the two principles ensues.  However, at the beginning, Abby enters into the relationship with caution, while Owen, who is so desperate for companionship, is frustrated by Abby's reluctance. Abby even warns Owen that they can't be friends at their relationship's inception. But after a while, Abby becomes intrigued by and then eventually begins to care for Owen and Owen for Abby. Abby and Owen develop an unbreakable bond, much to the dismay of Abby's ""father"" and they are soon bound to protect each other from harm. They provide a much needed companionship for each other, and they will protect their relationship at any cost, even if the continuation of their relationship calls for the sacrifice of the people who are in their lives. But when you're dealing with two lonely and suffering twelve year old kids, could you expect anything different?The acting is great from all of the principle actors. Richard Jenkins and Elias Coteas each shine in their roles as the ""father"" and the cop who investigate the ""ritual"" murders taking place in the small town.  But it is the two kids who create an indelible impact in the viewers mind. Chloe Moretz and Kodi Smith McPhee are both twelve years old, but their acting is so beyond their respective ages. Kodi Smith McPhee is amazing as Owen.  His performance invites sympathy for his plight, but he also provides us with a glimpse of his character's potential as a future sociopath when he indulges in his fantasies of killing people, and creepily spies on the neighbors in his apartment complex.  Chloe Moretz is equally effective as Abby, projecting sadness, innocence, world weariness, and craftiness through her characterization of Abby. Even the bullies who torment Owen are great, especially the leader who injects his character with a muscular brutality that his counterpart in the original film did not have. In the book, the main bully is written as someone who is quite capable of murder, and the boy who plays him in this film really gives you that impression.So give this movie a chance.  I promise that you won't regret it. It is so much better than the horror movies that the American public has to sit through now a days. This movie doesn't focus on devising creative ways for one person to inflict violence on another person(Saw and Hostel) as a means to create horror. ""Let Me In"" performs a study of horror based upon dysfunctional relationships, and the psychological damage that these relationships can inflict.  The violence that takes place in the film is a necessary counterpart to the story, and a necessity for the main character, not a means for amusement. So when Abby does kill, you're not tempted to roll your eyes and groan because of absurdity. And it is not just Abby, every character in this film does what they do out of necessity, not gratuity.Oh, and read the book that both films are based on.  You will be thoroughly affected by the book.  I guarantee it.",5,Give this movie a chance,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,5993,"['many', 'who', 'were', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'fantastic', 'Swedish', 'film', 'Right', 'One', 'was', 'little',

I won't go into a lot of detail so I don't act as spoiler, but I'll just say that if vampires walked the earth, I think they would live a life more similar to the fanged-teeth characters in this movie.I haven't seen the original movie this film is based upon, so I can't make a comparison between the two; I just know I thought this film was very good overall.  Recent newcomers Chlo Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee did a nice job in the two lead roles, while Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas added credibility to the casting in strong supporting nods.The plot in this movie involves Smit-McPhee's character, Owen, being targeted by school bullies and subsequently befriending his new neighbor, Moretz's character, Abby.  Abby helps Owen see that he can't let himself be bullied to no end, but rather needs to stand up for himself if he wants to get enjoyment out of life.  As Abby and Owen's friendship grows, Owen does begin to defend himself against his thug peers, and Abby provides extra support when needed.  Their friendship also spawns unique situations that also lie at the heart of the movie's theme.Bottom line: ""Let Me In"" combines an interesting story with high-level acting to create a unique movie within the vampire realm.",5,"""Let Me In"" Adds a Unique Perspective to the Bloodsucking Genre",1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,1390,"['Let', 'Me', 'take', ""'glamour"", 'vampirism', 'when', 'compared', 'stylistic', 'bloodsucking', 'movies', 'late', 'i.e', 'Twighlight', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'lot', 'detail', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'spoiler', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'vampires', 'walked', 'earth', 'think', 'would', 'live', 'life', 'more', 'similar', 'fanged-teeth', 'characters', 'movie.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'movie', 'film', 'based', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'comparison', 'two', 'just', 'know', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'overall', 'Recent', 'newcomers', 'Chlo', 'Moretz', 'Kodi', 'Smit-McPhee', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'two', 'lead', 'roles', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'added', 'credibility', 'casting', 'strong', 'supporting', 'nods.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'Smit-McPhee', 'character', 'Owen', 'being', 'targeted', 'school', 'bullies', 'subsequently', 'befriending', 'new', 'neighbor', 'Moretz', 'character', 'Abby', 'Abby', 'Owen', 'see', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'be', 'bullied', 'end', 'rather', 'stand', 'up', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'life', 'Abby', 'Owen', 'friendship', 'Owen', 'begin', 'defend', 'thug', 'peers', 'Abby', 'extra', 'support', 'when', 'needed', 'friendship', 'also', 'unique', 'situations', 'also', 'lie', 'heart', 'movie', 'theme.Bottom', 'line', 'Let', 'Me', 'combines', 'interesting', 'story', 'high-level', 'acting', 'create', 'unique', 'movie', 'vampire', 'realm']",N/A
1339845,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B003EYVXUU,C. Sawin,"[8, 12]","Let the Right One In  was one of the most talked about films of 2008. Even outside the horror community, critics and moviegoers alike were raving how the film breathed new life into the tired vampire genre. While the Swedish film certainly had its moments and told a pretty amazing story, it wasn't quite as exceptional as everyone made it out to be. When word came that Cloverfield director Matt Reeves  would be remaking the film for American audiences, there was a massive amount of skepticism. You've probably heard the complaints about remakes before. How they're never as good as the original and are only done to make a quick buck. Well Hollywood may have pulled a fast one on you and is set to release a remake that's actually worth seeing for once.The trickiest part when handling a remake like this is what the writers, directors, and anyone else behind the scenes decide to change in comparison to the original film. If they change too much then people complain that it strayed too far from the original, but if they change too little then people claim it's too similar to the original and that it was pointless to remake in the first place. They've got to find a balance; add just the right amount of different and new material while maintaining a film that follows in the same footsteps of whatever it was based on. Let Me In just does that.Let Me In is actually at its strongest during the scenes where it ventures away from the 2008 film. Just about any scene that takes place in a car is spectacular, especially during one particular scene where things don't go exactly as planned. There's also a scene where Abby attacks a jogger in a tunnel that's pretty brutal. These added scenes didn't take anything away from the already well-established story, but actually managed to add depth to these characters a good portion of the people seeing this are already familiar with. Considering most Hollywood remakes, this is well worth mentioning. Let Me In at least deserves credit for pulling off something like that.There are several alterations to the story that may put off some who were Let the Right One In enthusiasts. Oskar and Eli are now Owen and Abby and the film now takes place in New Mexico rather than Stockholm. Some of the more memorable scenes in the film didn't make quite as much of an impact as they did in Let the Right One In. Virginia being exposed to sunlight and the pool scene at the end of the film being the two biggest examples. It's not that those particular scenes weren't done well, but they just felt too similar or maybe weren't quite different enough to distinguish them in comparison to the original. That's probably my biggest complaint with the film overall. If you've seen Let the Right One In, then you know how everything turns out. That's a pretty obvious statement dealing with a remake, but knowing that going in really seemed to hurt the experience overall.Let Me In definitely deserves to be held in high regard as one of the best horror remakes in recent years and perhaps ever. Its newly added material blends in nicely into an already well-written vampire story. It just felt like the film could have been even stronger if it was a bit more unpredictable. Nevertheless, its wonderful cast, enticing storyline, and eye-catching camera work will satisfy just about any moviegoer and is a surprisingly strong horror film to be released this late in the year.",4,One of the most accurate and well-written horror remakes in recent years,1285891200,"10 1, 2010",2010,3414,"['Let', 'Right', 'One', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'talked', 'films', '2008', 'Even', 'horror', 'community', 'critics', 'moviegoers', 'alike', 'were', 'raving', 'how', 'film', 'breathed', 'new', 'life', 'tired', 'vampire', 'genre', 'Swedish', 'film', 'certainly', 'had', 'moments', 'told', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'exceptional', 'everyone', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'When', 'word', 'came', 'Cloverfield', 'director', 'Matt', 'Reeves', 'would', 'be', 'remaking', 'film', 'American', 'audiences', 'was', 'massive', 'amount', 'skepticism', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'heard', 'complaints', 'remakes', 'before', 'How', ""'re"", 'never', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'are', 'only', 'done', 'make', 'quick', 'buck', 'Well', 'Hollywood', 'may', 'have', 'pulled', 'fast', 'one', 'set', 'release', 'remake', 'actually', 'worth', 'seeing', 'once.The', 'trickiest', 'part', 'when', 'handling', 'remake', 'what', 'writers', 'directors', 'anyone', 'else', 'scenes', 'decide', 'change', 'comparison', 'original', 'film', 'change', 'too', 'much', 'then', 'people', 'complain', 'strayed', 'too', 'far', 'original', 'change', 'too', 'little', 'then', 'people', 'claim', 'too', 'similar', 'original', 'was', 'pointless', 'remake', 'first', 'place', ""'ve"", 'got', 'find', 'balance', 'add', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'different', 'new', 'material', 'maintaining', 'film', 'same', 'footsteps', 'whatever', 'was', 'based', 'Let', 'Me', 'just', 'that.Let', 'Me', 'actually', 'strongest', 'scenes', 'where', 'ventures', 'away', '2008', 'film', 'Just', 'scene', 'place', 'car', 'spectacular', 'especially', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'where', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'exactly', 'as', 'planned', 'also', 'scene', 'where', 'Abby', 'jogger', 'tunnel', 'pretty', 'brutal', 'added', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'already', 'well-established', 'story', 'actually', 'managed', 'add', 'depth', 'characters', 'good', 'portion', 'people', 'seeing', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'Considering', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'remakes', 'well', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Let', 'Me', 'least', 'deserves', 'credit', 'pulling', 'off', 'something', 'are', 'several', 'alterations', 'story', 'may', 'put', 'off', 'who', 'were', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'enthusiasts', 'Oskar', 'Eli', 'are', 'now', 'Owen', 'Abby', 'film', 'now', 'place', 'New', 'Mexico', 'rather', 'Stockholm', 'more', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'quite', 'much', 'impact', 'did', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'Virginia', 'being', 'exposed', 'sunlight', 'pool', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'being', 'two', 'biggest', 'examples', 'not', 'particular', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'done', 'well', 'just', 'felt', 'too', 'similar', 'maybe', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'different', 'enough', 'distinguish', 'comparison', 'original', 'probably', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'film', 'overall', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'then', 'know', 'how', 'everything', 'out', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'statement', 'dealing', 'remake', 'knowing', 'going', 'really', 'seemed', 'hurt', 'experience', 'overall.Let', 'Me', 'definitely', 'be', 'held', 'high', 'regard', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'remakes', 'recent', 'years', 'perhaps', 'ever', 'newly', 'added', 'material', 'blends', 'nicely', 'already', 'well-written', 'vampire', 'story', 'just', 'felt', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'stronger', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'unpredictable', 'Nevertheless', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'enticing', 'storyline', 'eye-catching', 'camera', 'work', 'will', 'satisfy', 'just', 'moviegoer', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'horror', 'film', 'be', 'released', 'late', 'year']",N/A
1339846,A3U7ELIED4WP4R,B003EYVXUU,Dark Faerie Tales,"[23, 29]","The Review:Spoiler Alert- I've intentionally been vague in my description of events in the film and have endeavored not to discuss anything you couldn't glean from the theatrical preview.  But nonetheless there's bound to be a spoiler or two in the following review.Let Me In is the American remake of the Swedish Film, Let The Right One In, based on the bestselling novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist.  With incredibly strong performances by Kodi Smit-McPhee and Clo Moretz, who played Hitgirl in the excellent Kick Ass, Let Me In earns a special place in the increasingly crowded vampire urban fantasy subgenre.  I've rarely seen such young actors carry a film on their shoulders the way these two have.Set in New Mexico in the winter of 1983, Let Me In tells the story of Owen, a lonely 12 year old, bullied mercilessly at school.  His parents are in the midst of an acrimonious divorce and he spends his nights by himself in the courtyard of his apartment building playing and devouring candy.  There aren't any other kids in his apartment building until one night when Abby and her dad move into the apartment next door.  Owen quickly realizes that Abby isn't like other girls.  She walks barefoot in the snow, smells a little funny and seems way out of touch.  Owen also hears strange noises coming through his bedroom wall from Abby's apartment.  The audience learns in short order that Abby is in fact no ordinary little girl and that the relationship between her and her father is unnatural to say the least.Let Me In is quite a subversive bit of storytelling.  It turns many clich&eacute;s on their heads.  The kids in the film are not innocent little angels.  Owen, who is constantly preyed upon by bullies, steals from his mother's purse, acts out violent power fantasies, and shows a few of the warning signs of becoming a future serial murderer.  Abby, while she has the face of an angel, is anything but.  By the time you reach the film's end and reflect on her relationships with her father and Owen, you may be surprised to find that she is actually quite a manipulative and a hugely destructive force.  Her guile is never overt, and remarkably I found myself feeling a lot of sympathy for her despite her showing herself to be capable of some truly brutal behavior.Let Me In also succeeds in its use of subtlety.  The most effective scenes in the film, including its climax are more effective for what isn't shown.  Appearances are deceiving, and the film challenges the audience to fill in some of the blanks and ponder why Abby and her father are the way they are and what the future holds for Abby and Owen.

The Stephen King seal of approval didn't help.  Now I can see why King calls this the best horror film in twenty years.  Not as a knock on the film, it plays like a middle school version of ""Carrie"".  Director Matt Reeves expertly establishes time and place by placing the film in 1983 snow-swept Los Alamos, New Mexico.  This creates a claustrophobic feeling that enhances the fright factor.  He's ably abetted by the terrific performances of his juvenile leads, Kodi Smit-McPhee as the tormented young boy and Chloe Grace Moretz as the ageless vampire trapped in a twelve year old girl's body.  Smit-McPhee and Moretz, belying their years, make the love between their characters palpable and believable.  You'll shed a tear from time to time even if one of the lovers would rather cut your throat than embrace you.

1339852,A2HXXOOJ3U0AH5,B003EYVXUU,Dennis Azevedo,"[2, 2]","These movies are sort of difficult to rate.  On one hand both tell a compelling story, are fairly well acted, and have satisfying conclusions.  On the other hand neither are really scary- at all.  The jump scares that are put in do not induce any fright and very little reaction.  So here is my problem.  Which trumps in this situation?  To help break this down I will examine each against each other, because I do feel that one is the superior movie.  I'll come out and say now that I prefer Let the Right One In, which is the original Swedish film.  The subject matter dealt with in both of these films is difficult for any actor, let alone children.  Both movies are well directed and reveal how the director was approaching the source material, which I will admit I am unfamiliar with.  Going by the films alone I think much of this is going to be personal preference in the end.  I'll begin with the tones of the films.  The Swedish version plays up the innocence in the main character, Oskar.  Throughout the film he has a real naivet&eacute; about him that never leaves, whereas Owen in the American version has much more anger.  This speaks to the sensibilities of the countries in which they were made.  In the States there are very few characters cut from Oskar's ilk anymore.  We want our protagonists strong and willing to fight, Oskar is not this.  Even in the scene where he does fight back, it is very subdued.  When the main antagonist begins bleeding from the ear I was genuinely shocked because it barely looked like he was hit.  I was expecting Oskar to hit him with the pole, have little effect, and still have the snot beat out of him.  It wasn't important how hard he hit, just that he did.  Owen, though, wants to cause pain.  He is angry and feels helpless and this fuels his rage.  It doesn't help that we feel less for the antagonist in the American version.  Neither versions have this character fleshed out, other than a brief mention of him being bullied in the home.  This backstory in itself bothers me because it is so cliche.Another stark difference between the two characters comes when we are first introduced to them.  Oskar is seen in his room with a large knife acting out the famous 'You talkin' to me' scene from Taxi Driver.  We can see that this is the kind of guy he wants to be- someone who is strong and unafraid.  Owen has a similiar moment when we meet him.  He also has a large knife, but he is acting just like his bully, using the same words that are used on him.  He does not want to be someone who is strong and unafraid, but he wants to inflict his pain on others.  There is a real sense that if he were in the bullies position he would not hesitate to torture another person.  I think this makes him less sympathetic as a character.The other important part of this film is the character of Eli/Abby.  Here it is harder to differentiate.  Both actresses play the character in a very similiar matter.  Both are terrible at being vampires in the sense that they do not have any subtlty or stealth in their attacks.  The Swedish version does not has quite as much on-screen with Eli in vampire form as the American version.  This again goes back to the sensiblities of the coutries they were targeting.  Other than that both are done well, though I do still feel that the Swedish version comes out ahead.  The characters killed seem to have more reason to be killed rather than just being there at the time.Overall both of these moves are good.  If I had to rate them I would put Let Me In at 3 while Let the Right One In is 3.5.  Both tell good stories, but neither are really scary.

1339857,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B003EYVXUU,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","LET ME IN (2010) is a nice, simple title for a relatively nice, simple vampire-horror flick. It is based on the Swedish novel and film ""Lt den r&auml;tte komma in"", by John Ajvide Lindqvist (""Let the Right One In"", 2008, dir. Tomas Alfredson:Let The Right One In, see my review.)Do not confuse it with the little-known LET ME IN of 2000 - about which I can discover nothing. This, set in Los Alamos, New Mexico in 1983, this story is about poor young Owen (a spectacular Kodi Smit-McPhee). Owen is nearly 13, he's bullied severely and his mother is a religious drunk. The poor boy is turning scary as a result, a bit like seeing Hitler in the making, and it is revolting to see him practicing ... well, I'll leave that for you to discover.Into his life comes 12-year-old vampire Abbey (the equally talented Chloe Grace Moritz), a girl who is at once charming, somewhat naive or dull, yet she writes with something like Mark Twain's handwriting and expressions. She cannot answer Owen when he pointedly asks her if she is a vampire, and there are other things even a regular 12-year-old girl ought to know. Perhaps it's all the hiding in the dark all her undead afterlife. It seems she is nearly 150 or something to that effect. As I understand it, the original character is meant to be 200 years old.LET ME IN has a powerful supporting cast: Elias Koteas as the detective investigating murders, Richard Jenkins as Abbey's boyfriend (c'mon, she's a vampire, they met when he was a kid and he loves her). The boyfriend is committing the murders to get Abbey her blood. Aside from the bone-crunching savagery of Abbey when hungry, there is too much Hammerblood and gore for my taste. That's right, I said Hammerblood!But then, this is a Hammer Films production (via Overture Films for Starz). Odd that I recall my first Hammer film, DRACULA (1958) which catapulted Christopher Lee to international fame. Other Hammer films are the backbone of horror in today's world. What angers me about this film - and the reason I starred it so low - is because I'm tired of all this kidsploitation. These children are too young to be handling roles of such weight and horror.Recently I read an interview with Werner Herzog in ""Archeology Review"" magazine. He mentioned his old complaint, that we do not have symbols or images worthy of our level of intelligence. He not only means cinema: his grandfather was a prominent though not too well known archeologist. Herzog says that film and advertizing, for example, simply dried up long ago. We are presented no challenges, no context, no feeling and no imagination. The errors in this film came to mind when I read the Herzog interview - it was not a chance occurrence.Screenplay writer/director Matt Reeves (CLOVERFIELD, THE PALLBEARER) does himself some credit here, neither reveling in nor shrinking from the challenges he places on his young actors' thin shoulders. He captures a silent atmosphere which I like to call ""atmosfear"" - but the Swedes are better at this in general. (They are also wizards at inserting a prominent cop character in every film they produce, which is the one thing lacking in the original film, ironically enough.)LET ME IN compensates with its eye-popping, slick special effects, which really impressed me. There is an auto accident filmed from inside the car, and how they accomplished this horrific and realistic crash effect is beyond me.In his review, Roger Ebert expressed some confusion about some things, namely why there was snow in New Mexico (it does snow heavily there, Roger) and he stated that this film is a scene-for-scene remake of the Swedish original. I have to DISAGREE, as I disagree with the director's Swedish angle. However, it is almost a scene-for-scene remake. We always ruin Swedish masterpieces by remaking them. We need to stop the remakes - but this made me itchy to see the original. I have now seen it and LOVED it.The half-right, half-wrong era is amusing. The makers clearly did not live through or pay attention to the early 1980s. While some details are spot on, others are pathetic. Why set the film in the early 1980s? - my guess is to make forensics and detection a lot harder. Vampires are like to get dealt with rapidly in the 21st century, I guess.So, is this film about the true nature of evil, the nature of being undead and not really loving it, pure voyeurism as Hitchcock always contended was the goal of film, or is it simply Hammer Films trying to hammer a new stamp on cinematic history? If any of these is true, Hammer had better start doing a lot better than this. I deduct one star.The amazing soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is one of the best I have ever heard and melds Foley art with music in an eerie aural confection. There are a few good 1980s songs here, but I wonder at the dates. If there were a way I could get the Giacchino soundtrack without the 1980s radio chatter, I'd get it for its creepy beauty alone.Now that I have enjoyed the original film, may I recommend you get that, and forget this unless you're hardcore about inadequate, rushed remakes. Also I have to ask: why do we keep remaking these great Swedish films within a year or two? Why remake them at all?",4,"A Dead Giveaway, or a Lesson in Being Undead?",1297296000,"02 10, 2011",2011,5198,"['LET', 'ME', 'IN', '2010', 'nice', 'simple', 'title', 'relatively', 'nice', 'simple',

1339858,A2PLMMVM7J0128,B003EYVXUU,Ehkzu,"[3, 3]","No-spoilers review of ""Let me In"":I'm going to help you decide whether you want to get this DVD, regardless of what I think of it. I will do so without telling you what happens.I recommended this to a friend at church in passing. Later he saw my wife and asked her what it was about. She said ""It's a vampire movie."" He said ""That's all I need to know.""This guy is a college professor, so he's pretty smart--and statistically he'd probably be right, given what most ""vampire movies"" are like. And yes, it is a vampire movie. But it's so different from most other vampire movies that leaving it at that is really misleading.For one thing, most vampire movies are either romantic PG-13 Romeo and Julietty things aimed at 15 year old girls (of all ages), or blood-drenched R-rated splatterfests aimed at teenaged boys (of all ages).This is neither. Hence the disgusted one-star reviews here by folks looking for one or the other--and who always assume the director was trying to make one or the other but was just too dumb to do so. Pretty funny, really--the arrogance of the mediocre.Another source of misleadingment is the fact that this stars the same actress who played Hit Girl in ""Kick-Ass (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)"", Chlo Grace Moretz. In that film she plays an ultraviolent vigilante psycho killer (and does most of her own stunts BTW). But in ""Hugo,"" which came out recently, she plays a bookish, sunny, nonviolent girl. It's called acting. And Moretz has no interest in being typecast, so you can't use her being in a movie to conclude anything about a movie except that it will probably be different from the normal fare in some way. You can expect her to do her own stunts mostly--she trained for six months for her role in ""Kickass"" and now may be physically the strongest, most agile actress in her age range.She is one reason to see ""Let me in."" She and Hailee Steinfeld (True Gritare both serious about acting. And both, in their early teens, are doing mostly adult-oriented movies. Moretz has the added advantage of being destined to be the next Scarlett Johansson in a number of ways--looks, intelligence, gravitas and an arresting appearance--not just pretty.I think Moretz wanted this role because it gave her the opportunity to do a layered performance. There's a scene where her character says ""I'm stronger than you think I am."" The other teen actresses who auditioned for the role said it as a brag, smiling smugly as they did so. Moretz stated it matter-of-factly, as a piece of information Owen needed to know, but with a whiff of great sadness, since that strength is part and parcel of what's different about her that means she will never be able to have a normal life. To grow up. To have a family. To not have to live on the run forever. So she's not bragging about her strength, because she's hundreds of years past thinking it was Kool--if she ever did.Moretz put something into the character all those other beautiful, trained, skilled actresses didn't. She had a 360 view of Abby, while the others did not.You'll like this movie if you like what Moretz liked about the script, the project. It's almost like a cross between one of those Sundance Festival movies and a Hollywood movie. It has the feel of a European art film with just a tad more vividness--a bit sparklier special effects, music, high-voltage talent (like the great character actor Richard Jenkins as Abby's gofer).That's no surprise because it's adapted from the Swedish novel ""Let the Right One In: A Novel (Paperback)and the Swedish movieLet The Right One In.So why not just see the original movie? Well, as it happens, I did see it first--and loved it. And not just me. The Rottentomatoes website aggregates critics' reviews and ratings, and the average of the 166 reviews it lists was a whopping 98%, while 44,000 viewers rated it an average of 90%. For ""Let Me In"" 205 critics gave it an average rating of a still very respectable 89% while 55,000 site viewers gave it 74%.I think the lower average audience rating for ""Let Me In"" stemmed from misplaced loyalty to ""Let the right One In."" As if you have to choose one or the other. Team Abby or Team Eli. I don't know why this is, though. I've seen at least a dozen versions of Hamlet, and many bring something unique to the original play. Same here. An expert film critic could list a dozen aspects to each film that are better than the way the same aspect is executed in the other one.And of course some people are strongly biased towards or against Hollywood. If you have a strong bias, you already know which you'll want to see. If you're like me you'll want to see both. I own both movies, and both have stuck with me, while most movies don't. Each, in its own way, is truly haunting.Both films are vampire films that make most other vampire films seem juvenile, which is ironic, since the characters in ""Let me in""/""Let the right one in"" are juveniles.In some ways the films are meditations on what it would be like to be a vampire, both for better and for worse; and metaphorically, for what it's like to be different from others in ways that make you superior in some ways, yet doomed to never get to experience the humble delights of ordinary human existence, and in that sense it's a study of normal human existence by seeing what it would be like to not have that.""Let Me In"" definitely has a Hollywood flavor compared to the Swedish model. The vampire is prettier, the music more pervasive, the violence violenter, the landscape even bleaker (though not in all respects). Some find these differences extremely annoying. But I showed ""Let Me In"" to a pair of Russian intellectuals I know who had not seen the Swedish film or read the book, and they loved it. I don't know how they would have reacted if they'd seen ""Let the Right One In"" first, but I think it's significant that without that comparison they found ""Let Me In"" to be a real quality film.There's a plus to seeing both versions--it's like seeing a story from the viewpoints of different characters, though both movies take third party Point of View.But the emphases are distinct. Even where both films show the same scene it feels different. Don't believe reviewers here who say this is a shot for shot remake of the Swedish original. That just means they weren't looking closely enough.One kind of person who won't like either movie is Good Guys vs. Bad Guys kind of people--people who think if you show the human side of the villain you're somehow excusing the villain's villainy. People like the fictional Inspector Javert inLes Miserables: The 10th Anniversary Dream Cast in Concert at London's Royal Albert Hall--who was so unhinged by the escaped prisoner Jean Valjean's sparing his life that he committed suicide.The vampires in these movies didn't ask to be vampires, don't want to be vampires, and would stop being vampires if there was a way out other than self-annihilation. And even if you don't normally watch vampire movies or horror movies you may want to watch this one. It's really more suspense than horror--a bit like Alfred Hitchcock.Bottom line: this is a serious movie in a genre that's rarely serious. To put it another way, it's a serious take on a non-serious genre. It doesn't ask you to believe in vampires--only that if they existed, their existences would be as fraught and painful and unromantic as they're portrayed here.SPOILERS FOLLOW--DON'T READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN OR READ THE BOOK OR ONE OF THE FILMSSuppose you've seen ""Let the Right One In"" or read the book, which the Swedish movie hews to more closely.If you expect the movie to copy the book, neither movie will please you, but the Swedish version will displease you less.The critics generally agree that ""Let Me In"" is a fine movie, while ""Let the Right One In"" verges on greatness.I love both and I see why the critics rate the Swedish version a tad higher--but there's one plot essential where the Swedish version is truer to the novel but falser to the audience. In the book and the Swedish movie, Eli is actually a castrated boy in drag, basically. In the American version Abby is a girl period. I think the Swedish original is trying to have it both ways, though, by casting a girl (Lina Leandersson) in the part--and not just a girl, but a girl who looks very much like a girl, and who acts like a girl. So while the Swedish version is technically truer to the novel, (a) I'm not seeing the movie as a visualization of the novel, and (b) the American version is more honest. It has a girl play a girl at least. If the Swedish movie had cast a boy to play Eli(as), that would have been true to the book, though it would have had far fewer viewers, including me. I'm glad neither movie was true to the book, frankly.I wouldn't have disapproved of Eli being a boy in the movie, but I probably wouldn't have chosen to watch it either. And Eli/Abby's social isolation and disinterest in sex have nothing to do with Eli/Abby's gender, but rather by her age (12) and need to be an unwilling serial killer, which can be quite a buzz kill. So the rest of the story doesn't need this character to be a boy for the rest of the story to make sense.And apart from this element, there are parts of the American movie that are better than the Swedish original, even though I grant that the reverse is also true (especially how the woman dies in the Swedish version, and how Eli spares the life of one kid in the pool scene, the visual of Eli scaling the side of the hospital, and the visual of what happens to Eli when (s)he enters a home without permission). But when Owen asks Abby what is she if she's not a girl, Abby says ""I'm nothing,"" while Eli just stares at him with those Japanese anime character huge eyes. Abby's response is more profound, and her being a girl makes the reason for her saying ""I'm nothing"" deeper--you don't need gender bending to feel isolated if you're a vampire. Honest. Being a vampire is plenty!Also, it's absolutely fascinating to see Chlo Grace Moretz' rendition of Abby/Eli. She didn't see the Swedish movie or read the novel before making the movie, so this is her independent interpretation (ditto the boy). It's really different from Leandersson's, yet both performances are deep--truly impressive from actors so young. And the difference in their appearances contribute to making the role different.So instead of trying to decide which is better--which here is like asking if a pear is better than bacon--I love having two unique interpretations of a fine story to watch.The negative reviews of ""Let Me In"" by ""Let the Right One In"" fans--and vice versa--show that there's a Team Abby and a Team Eli...and Team Can't We All Just Get Along? which I belong to. You probably won't enjoy ""Let me in"" if you regard every difference as automatically inferior, and every similarity as automatically a needless copy, and if you feel superior to Hollywood movies in general.I should point out that both films end the same way, so it's not like they tacked one of those happy Hollywood fantasy endings onto this story. And I should add that the author of the book has endorsed both versions. That doesn't prove both versions are good, but it does cast an interesting light on those who disparage ""Let Me In"" because they think it betrays the book.I haven't addressed the subtitle issue because dubbing is unacceptable to me in all circumstances (except when used for humorous effect), and anyone who has the sensitivity to enjoy ""Let the Right One In"" must be able to deal with subtitles.You'll like ""Let Me In"" alongside ""Let the Right One In"" especially if you're a serious filmgoer and like to see, for example, different versions of Shakespeare plays.Lastly, I think people on Team Eli believe that the American version is stealing sales from the Swedish original. Personally I'd argue that the exact opposite is true. ""Let Me In"" will garner viewers who wouldn't see the Swedish original anyway because they don't like subtitles and dubbing, and/or because they prefer more American production values and style, as I described in the first part of this review. At the same time a certain % of ""Let Me In"" viewers will then want to see how the Swedish version did it, because it's a good enough story to justify multiple interpretations.Wouldn't it be interesting to see how Hayao Miyazaki would interpret this story as an animated film? I think it would be magnificent, given how wonderfulSpirited Awayis...",5,"No spoilers review + Spoilers review for those who've seen ""Let the Right One In""",1324684800,"12 24,

Johnson ""'ntohign slhe thaersam'""","[4, 5]","Let me In is an American film based of the Swedish novel, Let the Right One In, which was already produced as a motion picture. The story features two very lonely children who form a special bond over the span of about two weeks; it actually seems like love at first sight, or as close to it has the children are capable. The whole plot revolves around the protagonist Abby - a vampire - and her willingness to allow another to see her as she is. It takes time, but eventually Owen, her meek neighbor, finds himself friends with a blood-sucker.The movie is slow. I think it serves to add a bit more tension and creepiness. Of course, this may set off some viewers. There is very little CGI and the special effects are used to show the story, not to shine a light on the gore The acting is beautiful and haunting, and you can quickly see how the film may end. The cinematography is breathtaking, with the best use of dull color light and empty space to push the loneliness that much further. Predictability aside, I come away from watching the film seeing how two very different people can find trust and love, despite their difference.Do take note of the R rating. The movie puts the spotlight on the 12 year old actors, but this is not a kid's film. For every bit of violence that occurs off-camera there is a bloody scene to follow it up. The film also deals with Owen being abused horribly by fellow students.By far, this is my favorite vampire movie since the Lugosi original.",5,Creepiest Love Story - Ever,1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,1480,"['Let', 'American', 'film', 'based', 'Swedish', 'novel', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'was', 'already', 'produced', 'motion', 'picture', 'story', 'two', 'very', 'lonely', 'children', 'who', 'form', 'special', 'bond', 'span', 'about', 'two', 'weeks', 'actually', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'as', 'close', 'children', 'are', 'capable', 'whole', 'plot', 'revolves', 'protagonist', 'Abby', 'vampire', 'willingness', 'allow', 'see', 'time', 'eventually', 'Owen', 'meek', 'neighbor', 'blood-sucker.The', 'movie', 'slow', 'think', 'add', 'bit', 'more', 'tension', 'creepiness', 'course', 'may', 'set', 'off', 'viewers', 'very', 'little', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'used', 'show', 'story', 'not', 'shine', 'light', 'gore', 'acting', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'can', 'quickly', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'may', 'end', 'cinematography', 'breathtaking', 'best', 'use', 'dull', 'color', 'light', 'empty', 'space', 'push', 'loneliness', 'much', 'further', 'Predictability', 'aside', 'come', 'away', 'watching', 'film', 'seeing', 'how', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'can', 'find', 'trust', 'love', 'difference.Do', 'take', 'note', 'R', 'rating', 'movie', 'spotlight', '12', 'year', 'old', 'actors', 'not', 'kid', 'film', 'bit', 'violence', 'off-camera', 'bloody', 'scene', 'follow', 'up', 'film', 'also', 'Owen', 'being', 'abused', 'horribly', 'fellow', 'students.By', 'far', 'favorite', 'vampire', 'movie', 'Lugosi', 'original']",N/A
1339863,A283JVPUGXOFAZ,B003EYVXUU,Ermite,"[5, 8]","It must be an interesting experience: You have top billing in a Hollywood movie but you are too young to see it.  This film is rated R for good reasons.  The lead characters are very well-cast.Stories about vampire children may be few.  We have Anne Rice's Claudia and S.P. Somtow's Timmy Valentine.  Eli (or Abby) is welcome.For those who have read the book and know the vampire's secret, the Swedish film hints at it but the Hollywood remake does not go near it.  Fans of the original can be reassured.  This remake carves its own path, yet the reason it succeeds is that the story it tells, so close the novel, is still a good story.In an interview, it was revealed that they filmed Abby's back-story, and it might be on the DVD.  It's not nearly as horrific as the novel.It is true that Hollywood remakes of successful foreign films have a poor record.  It is not generally known but the John Houston film ""The Maltese Falcon"" was a remake of a version of the story of only a few years earlier.  I saw it on PBS once.  But we remember only the Houston version.  I do not know if ""Let Me In"" will surpass the original in time, perhaps not, but it stands on its own success.I almost prefer this version.  I have to think about it, but I think the acting is better and cinematography was more powerful.  I like the subtle changes to the characterizations.  The boy may be in love with the girl, but he has not yet faced her wrath if she does not have her proper diet.  This vampire breaks the recent trend in beautiful, sexy, angst-driven creatures.  I like Michael Giacchino's musical score and have purchased several tracks.  The composer mixes the right amounts of sweetness and dread that make the thematic motif haunting and compelling.  The non-sequitur denouement at the pool is striking.  The resolution on the train is just as ambiguous as the original but more bittersweet.Could it have been ""stronger"" in some parts if I imagine myself as the filmmaker?  Yes.  But some scene compositions take your breath away.See this film, buy the soundtrack, and buy the DVD.

Owen is a young boy who feels a sense of alienation at home with his parents having marital problems. He is also is the target of bullies at schools. He internalizes ideas of revenge with his tormentors at times when alone. Drawn to his next door neighbor, Abby, he strikes up a friendship with her and they begin to pal around. It becomes clear to Owen that Abby is not like other children. She doesn't seem to have knowledge of simple everyday things, and is seemingly never around at school, which gives Owens clues that there is something shady about her. He also overhears what appears to be verbal abuse in her home next door. A string of bizarre murders leads one policeman to believe some cult is responsible. As Owen longs more and more for friendship, he gets closer and closer to Abby, even while he suspects she is in some way connected with the murders.A remake of the recent Swedish film Let the Right One In and based on the book by John Ajvide Lindqvist, Let Me In is a well-thought out, intelligent horror film that has the right balance of mood, plot and gore. Although it has elements of violence and gore, it doesn't overdo it to the point of making this the focus. There's a real understated quality to the film, especially the dialogue between Owen and Abby, but it works here because both characters are trying to channel acceptance from each other and understand their conflicted inner worlds. Both leads (Chloe Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee) are solid in their roles as the two friends.I haven't watched the original film yet, but looking forward to checking it out after seeing this.

I love the genre but hate the way it's been handled by untalented producers in search of a quick buck. At best their efforts are good for a mindless laugh.  At worst they're not worth watching even for their insights into the minds of angst-ridden teenagers and Romney supporters.Fortunately, every once in a while a true gem like this film comes along.  Set in a dreary wasteland, it tells the story of Owen, a 12 year old boy who's tormented both by bullies at school and his own feelings of powerlessness.  Into his life comes Abby, a creature who is cursed to an unending existence of feeding on human blood. The two form an uneasy friendship, which is complicated by Abby's unwillingness to share much about herself.  She offers Owen things he has never experienced before: encouragement and acceptance.  Under her tutelage he musters the courage to fight back against the boys who abuse him.  He also takes his first tenuous steps towards manhood, driven partially by his attraction to his new friend.As the plot develops, we never know if Abby really cares for Owen or is simply grooming him to serve her own dark purposes.  They're both drawn deeper into each other's worlds as the plot develops, until Owen is confronted with Abby's true nature.  He must then decide if he will fight her, flee from her, or learn to embrace her as she truly is.  The climactic scene is a masterpiece of understated menace that sent chills through me.Moderately explicit (by today's standards) in terms of its gore content, the scenes of graphic violence are used artistically, not gratuitously, and there is no sex.  But there is a powerful theme of seduction, which is illustrated masterfully from one scene to the next.  This film is an outstanding example of supernatural suspense that will be appreciated by discerning viewers.

While it has gory parts, it focuses more on the relationships between the characters, in a sympathetic perspective because of the innocence of the two 12 year old characters, except of course the one hasn't been 12 in many decades. Real vampire thrills, versus romanticized versions in recent years, going beyond even Anne Rice's version. If one has seen The Grudge, one may recognize the movements from that in this, the girl moves creepily, attacking in fast forward speed with jerky inhuman effects. The acting is incredibly great, the quality of special effects, visual & sound all excellent production values. Thrilling & suspenseful without being a nail-biting, cover your eyes kind of movie, yet never once boring or slow. Several plot twist surprises keep the film from being at all predictable, unless of course you have seen the original & know what is coming. I doubt I've ever seen two more beautiful actors than the 2 children in this movie, I could not take my eyes off the boy especially, but both were perfect. I would not recommend this to children under 18, the PG rating is not correct or consistent with other such film's ratings, at the very least parental guidance & discernment is called for before allowing a younger child to view this.

Teslovich,"[3, 15]","Hackneyed vampire story with a script and directing that was predictable, disjointed and lacking in creative storytelling that, sadly,  was potentially possible in this unique juxtaposition of two misunderstood needy lovers. Opportunity missed! Instead we just get shallow personifications of characters such as parents, guardians, caretakers, professionals and teachers that are presented as incompetent expendable meals that have no more depth than a shadow. These people were given such small stereotypic roles that we seem to care little whether they die or do nothing all film long. Just not real! The rest of the unreality of this film was the heavy reliance upon ripping people apart which, again, did nothing to advance our understanding of our misunderstood protagonists.Two stars for the cinematography and Chlo's presence. Although, wasted in a movie where her talents were diminished by very fakey blood; CGI teeth; bare feet endlessly filmed (another reason why Americans need to wear sandals more often) and posing for the camera with ""the look"" punctuated by limited scripted lines that seemed almost tritely comical. She needs a new agent.You would think that a nearly 1000 year old 12 year old vampire would have experienced love at least once in that long life span. Also, you would think that raiding blood banks and hospital blood freezers would be a whole lot quicker and safer source of hemoglobin (you know - AIDS; other viruses and pathogens would be screened out). Also, what does a Rubik's cube have to do with innately primitive blood hunting savagery - there's  just not a whole lot of abstract creative intelligence transfer between the two activities.Conclusion: Just a poorly thought out and directed script.",2,Could Have Been Much Better,1296691200,"02 3, 2011",2011,1739,"['Hackneyed', 'vampire', 'story', 'script', 'directing', 'was', 'predictable', 'disjointed', 'lacking', 'creative', 'storytelling', 'sadly', 'was', 'potentially', 'possible', 'unique', 'juxtaposition', 'two', 'misunderstood', 'needy', 'lovers', 'Opportunity', 'missed', 'Instead', 'just', 'get', 'shallow', 'personifications', 'characters', 'such', 'parents', 'guardians', 'caretakers', 'professionals', 'teachers', 'are', 'presented', 'incompetent', 'expendable', 'meals', 'have', 'more', 'depth', 'shadow', 'people', 'were', 'given', 'such', 'small', 'stereotypic', 'roles', 'seem', 'care', 'little', 'die', 'do', 'nothing', 'film', 'long', 'Just', 'not', 'real', 'rest', 'unreality', 'film', 'was', 'heavy', 'reliance', 'ripping', 'people', 'apart', 'again', 'did', 'nothing', 'advance', 'understanding', 'misunderstood', 'protagonists.Two', 'stars', 'cinematography', 'Chlo', 'presence', 'wasted', 'movie', 'where', 'talents', 'were', 'diminished', 'very', 'fakey', 'blood', 'CGI', 'bare', 'feet', 'endlessly', 'filmed', 'reason', 'why', 'Americans', 'need', 'wear', 'sandals', 'more', 'often', 'posing', 'camera', 'look', 'punctuated', 'limited', 'scripted', 'lines', 'seemed', 'almost', 'tritely', 'comical', 'new', 'agent.You', 'would', 'think', 'nearly', '1000', 'year', 'old', '12', 'year', 'old', 'vampire', 'would', 'have', 'experienced', 'love', 'least', 'once', 'long', 'life', 'span', 'Also', 'would', 'think', 'raiding', 'blood', 'banks', 'hospital', 'blood', 'freezers', 'would', 'be', 'whole', 'lot', 'quicker', 'safer', 'source', 'hemoglobin', 'know', 'AIDS', 'other', 'viruses', 'pathogens', 'would', 'be', 'screened', 'out', 'Also', 'what', 'Rubik', 'cube', 'have', 'do', 'innately', 'primitive', 'blood', 'hunting', 'savagery', 'just', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'abstract', 'creative', 'intelligence', 'transfer', 'two', 'activities.Conclusion', 'Just', 'poorly', 'thought', 'out', 'directed', 'script']",N/A

I am not crazy about reading subtitles but MOST movies are much better in the original language. Dubbed movies just don't have the same emotion and can't match the subtle nuances.There is no sense in telling anything about the movie as calling it a vampire movie does it an injustice as it is so much more than that. Telling you anything about the boy or the girl ruins the mystery aspect of the film.

Second, this American remake of LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is actually really good. I do have a preference for the Swedish adaptation, partly because it was the original film, partly because I still regard it as the superior film. Thankfully, director Matt Reeves did make sure to get novelist John Ajvide Lindqvist's blessings. Moments into the American version, that sinking feeling I had going in dissipated, never to return.The plot, if you haven't heard yet, tracks the bond formed between a lonely, mercilessly bulled boy and a vampire girl who moves in next door. It's sweet, yes, but horrifying. LET ME IN is one of the best horror films I've seen in recent years. It is stunningly atmospheric and stark and melancholy, graced with soulful acting by the two lead children, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz. These two kids are heartbreaking. One of the most striking elements is the film's deglamourizing of vampirism. ""Abby,"" eternally twelve years old, leads a a bleak, nomadic existence. Her predations reduce her to this feral, primal ghoul, and it's ugly to see, and shocking. It's indicative of Smit-McPhee and Moretz's extraordinary performances that you still find yourself rooting for their relationship to work out, for things to turn out okay for them. Never mind that Abby requires human blood to sustain her.It's obvious that Matt Reeves is drawing metaphors between vampirism and adolescence as a torturous existence. It's true, though, that real horror originates from close to home, when it's grounded in reality. Even more terrifying than the vampire element are those three kids who relentlessly victimize Owen in school. The score realizes this and introduces this really ominous beat whenever the trio converges on Owen. Sue me, I couldn't wait for them to get their violent comeuppance. And that's the twisted bit about this film, really. It makes you care about Owen and Abby and even about Abby's ""father,"" who is a serial killer (played by Richard Jenkins, excellent).Horror cinema and artistic merit are barely nodding acquaintances, but both converge in this movie. LET ME IN stands out from the pack, draws your eye like a bare-footed child on a chilly night. Or blood spilled on the snow banks of wintry Los Alamos, New Mexico. It fills you with creeping dread and leaves you with a bittersweet aftertaste. The love story is unconventional but hauntingly moving.

We had both seen ""Let the Right One In"" and loved it.  Such a beautifully made movie, and my heart just breaks for Eli and Oskar.  I couldn't get the movie out of my head, and I read many reviews of the film, just to learn others' perspectives.  Of course, I read the bookLet Me Inthat preceded the movie.  All of it helped me to better appreciate Let the Right One In.  This was why I was excited to learn that an American version would be made.  When discussing this with my friend, he was horrified that there would be a remake, and thought that it was an insult to the Swedish film.What a challenge for Matt Reeves, the director, to make his version of a film that was beloved by audiences around the world.  The essence of the story remains the same: a young boy, Owen, is horribly bullied by classmates at school, and he's neglected by his single mother at home.  When Abby moves into his apartment complex, Owen finds a kindred spirit - a young girl who seems every bit as lonely as he is.  She promises Owen she will protect him, and by the end of the film, she certainly fulfills that promise.  When Owen learns her secret, and when Abby's own life is at risk, he returns the favor.Chloe Grace Moretz as Abby is fantastic.  She had already proven her ability to play a strong, young girl inKick-Ass.  There are scenes that made my heart race (especially the car scene.)  I thought the rearranging of the chronology of several scenes worked well, although I wondered if Reeves' main intention of this was to differentiate himself.  It's an excellent movie that deserves to be seen.  Overall, though, Let the Right One In is the superior movie, and it has nothing to do with the fact that it came first.",4,"Deserves to be seen by fans of ""Let the Right One In""",1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,1828,"['recently', 'had', 'debate', 'friend', 'Swedish', 'filmLet', 'Right', 'One', 'English', 'Subtitled', 'vs.', 'Let', 'Me', 'had', 'seen', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'loved', 'beautifully', 'made', 'movie', 'heart', 'just', 'breaks', 'Eli', 'Oskar', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'head', 'read', 'many', 'reviews', 'film', 'just', 'learn', 'others', 'perspectives', 'course', 'read', 'bookLet', 'Me', 'Inthat', 'preceded', 'movie', 'helped', 'better', 'appreciate', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'was', 'why', 'was', 'excited', 'learn', 'American', 'version', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'When', 'discussing', 'friend', 'was', 'horrified', 'would', 'be', 'remake', 'thought', 'was', 'insult', 'Swedish', 'film.What', 'challenge', 'Matt', 'Reeves', 'director', 'make', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'beloved', 'audiences', 'world', 'essence', 'story', 'same', 'young', 'boy', 'Owen', 'horribly', 'bullied', 'classmates', 'school', 'neglected', 'single', 'mother', 'home', 'When', 'Abby', 'apartment', 'complex', 'Owen', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'bit', 'as', 'lonely', 'Owen', 'will', 'protect', 'end', 'film', 'certainly', 'promise', 'When', 'Owen', 'secret', 'when', 'Abby', 'own', 'life', 'risk', 'favor.Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'Abby', 'fantastic', 'had', 'already', 'proven', 'ability', 'play', 'strong', 'young', 'girl', 'inKick-Ass', 'are', 'scenes', 'made', 'heart', 'race', 'especially', 'car', 'scene', 'thought', 'rearranging', 'chronology', 'several', 'scenes', 'worked', 'well', 'wondered', 'Reeves', 'main', 'intention', 'was', 'differentiate', 'excellent', 'movie', 'be', 'seen', 'Overall', 'though', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'superior', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'fact', 'came', 'first']",N/A

I like the original because I was surprised at the simplicity of it. It was simple, straight forward film making and it was able to convey what all fine films convey, an emotional experience.Let me in is its own film and if compared to the original I would say that this version also created an emotional experience, but a much deeper and richer one. Neither version of the novel stick to it loyally. In the novel, the character of the old man who goes out in hunt for blood for Eli or Abby or whoever is a pedophile, doscovered by Eli when he was an older man, not when he was a child. Neither movie makes that clear. There is a separate plot line in the novel about an older friend of Oskars whose mother is having a relationship with the officer in charge of capturing the old man(Elis renfield) that is not touched on in either film.Also, in the novel the old man returns as a vampire monster because Eli/Abby does not break his neck after drinking his blood at the hospital window.I think the the remake captured the tone of the loneliness that both Owen and Abby feel as a result of her vampire existence and his lack of friends.

Truly one of the most unforgettable films I have ever seen the atmosphere, music are top notch. The creepiest part of this is how it mixes absolute horrific actions by Abby and makes you geniunley feel for her and Owens deep lonliness. Abby  played by Chole Grace Mortez is fantastic in a part where its not important of how much she says to owen but how and what little she information she gives to owen which makes the movie even more sad and more creepy.

1339886,A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI,B003EYVXUU,JAMES MCCORMICK,"[6, 7]","""Let Me In"" - 4 1/2 = Minor Masterpiece""Let Me In"" (2010) is the American remake of the Norwegian original, ""Let the Right One In"" (2008). It is about how two misfits find each other. Owen, (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who is terrorized by bullies at school, & fantasizes about revenge by playing out his fears when he is alone. His parents are divorced, & Owen just seems to not fit in anywhere, at school or at home. The other, Abby. Abby has just moved in next door, with who Owen at first thinks is her father, Richard Jenkins (who's role is called, ""the Father""), who actually is not Abby's father at all, but day time protector & provider of food, namely, blood, for Abby is a Vampire. She needs someone to watch over her during the day & to go out hunting for her at night, though you'll see later in the film, that Abby is perfectly capable of hunting down her own food. So the film starts.""Let Me In"" is a tragic horror film, the tragedy of loneliness, the tragedy of being stuck with who you are & what you are, of not fitting in. For Owen, it's loneliness, being weak, being an outcast. For Abby, it's being a Vampire & knowing she'll never stop being one. Abby will continue to live on, while one human companion after another takes care of her needs. It is the tragedy of knowing that the one person she selects as her companion will eventually die, & before he does, she'll have to find another to replace him. For her companion, it is knowing someday all this will happen, & when it does, the pain of desertion, replacement, the pain of knowing it is over. Both film's orchestrate these themes well, but I feel the remake does a better job of it. The acting, directing & editing seems to be quite a bit stronger, & the cast is perfect, but at the same time, the original film is dubbed, & that can contribute to how well a film seems acted & translates it's story to a foreign audience. In this case, the American version seems more intimate, tragic,  just by facial expressions & body language alone. This is especially evident in ""the Father"" character. Richard Jenkins exudes tragedy in just about every scene he is in. His eyes speak a million atrocious tragedies that he has committed. His eyes speak a great sadness in knowing his time is about over. His, is a greatly improved role & performance over the original. Same has to be said about Owen's part, Kodi Smit McPhee was born for this role. His eyes speak great sadness, but also, great fear, the fear of the world. His counterpart, ""Oscar,"" in the original film, shows much anger, but his role & performance is nowhere as deep, as sad, as multi-dimensional as Owens. Chloe Grace Moretz, as Abby, brings more tragedy & sadness to her role than her counterpart, ""Eli,"" in the original. This can especially be witnessed in scenes with ""the Father,"" especially the hospital scene. Both movies had the same scene, but the American version just takes it so much deeper. You can feel their pain, you can see their pain. In the original, it seemed just like a repeated scenario for Ali. There was a little sadness, but then it was all over in a blink of an eye, without much remorse, not so with the emotional punch of the remake.Both films are horror films, but here, the American version has the edge again. When Abby hunts her prey, she is absolutely feral, she looks the part, due to superior make up. She moves like the part, due to superior special effects. She is the part, as she ravenously feeds on her victims. One thing though that is missing in the remake, is the more overtly sexual relationship between Ali & Oscar, where it is only hinted at in the remake, the original is fairly frank about it, especially in the scene that Ali puts on Oscar's mother's dress, & he peers in to the room, there is a quick flash of frontal nudity. There is also a scene with a long kiss between the two.  Europe has a more worldly view on sexuality between children, where America does not blink an eye seeing a child frenetically feeding off her victims, but would be uncomfortable viewing a long kiss, let alone, nudity, between the two child actors.Another very important part of these movies are the bullies of both Owen & Oscar. The original film bullies were just weak, as compared to the brutal masochistic nature of the American film. There is a scene where both Owen & Oscar get whipped with what looks like a metal radio antenna. In the Norwegian film, as Oscar gets whipped, it looks more like love taps when compared to the American film, as Owen gets flogged, brutally flogged, you can feel every lash of the antenna. Another is where Owen gets whipped in the face with a towel in the boys locker room after gym class. You can feel that towel whipping his face, then if that is not enough, the bullies knock him to the floor & beat on him until he urinates in his pants out of terror. Yes, there is no comparison of the bullies here between the two films, the American version wins hands down, plus Owen is terrified even to make eye contact with his foes, where Oscar seems to be oblivious of them half the time.Both films are very good to great additions to the horror genre, they add depth, terror, horror, sadness, & loneliness, to a rather oversaturated time for Vampire movies, that are frankly, quite lame by comparison.

They'll be relieved that the movie leaves out some of the most disturbing elements of the novel, such as pedophila and Abby's (Eli's) sexual ambiguity. Though it is hinted at, it is never really explored in the film. Neither are her origins. This may be a relief to some, frustration for others.Those who have read the novel first will be disappointed that a lot of the back story so important to the novel is not covered in the film. That's to be expected to some extent for a film trying to remain under 2 hours in duration, but viewers who have not read the book will be left with a lot of questions and few answers. They'll feel like large parts of the story are missing and they'll question the motivations of characters because the movie doesn't offer them.Readers of the book and non-readers of the book will be equally disappointed.

1339890,A1ILWPH1GHUXE2,B003EYVXUU,JB,"[5, 7]","Let Me In is the American independent film remake of the highly regarded Swedish film of 2008,Let The Right One In.  After having watched both films, they tackle the same basic plot and subject matter from slightly different angles, but are both worthy of admiration.In my mind the overall feeling of Let the Right One In is one of isolation of the main characters, Oskar and Eli.  The stark winter landscapes, washed out colors, and lack of emotion shown my almost all of the protagonists add to this feeling of isolation, dreariness, and despair.  While Let Me In certainly spends a portion of it's time on the isolation of Owen, who has no connection to anyone else until Abby moves into his life, it also shows the terror that Owen lives in.  I think that Let Me In does a better job of detailing the fear and desperation that Owen feels -  fear and desperation that allows him to justify his increasing violent actions (or acceptance of such actions) in the film.  Until the penultimate scene of Let the Right One In, I never really felt that Oskar was that oppressed by the school bullies, and I didn't understand where all of the hatred and thirst for revenge against them was coming from.The other thing I noticed when comparing the two films was that Let Me In did a finer jobs of detailing the budding relationship between Owen and Abby better than Let the Right One In did with Oskar and Eli.  I was never fully convinced at the end of Let the Right One In why Oskar and Eli ended up together, while I understood perfectly why Owen chose to stay with Abby even though he understood the implications for his future.  Perhaps this was due to the outstanding performances by Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chlo Grace Moretz in the lead roles; perhaps this was just due to a bit being lost in translation from the Swedish language film.  I just felt the connection between Owen and Abby a bit more than that between Oskar and Eli.Now this is not meant to denigrate Let the Right One In; I think that the original can be a bit lethargic at times but is nevertheless a fine movie and deserving of its accolades.  But I would reiterate that Let Me In is an outstanding film in its own right.",5,Different - and perhaps better - take on the subject than the original Let Me In,1302048000,"04 6, 2011",2011,2185,"['Let', 'Me', 'American', 'independent', 'film', 'remake', 'highly', 'regarded', 'Swedish', 'film', '2008', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'having', 'watched', 'films', 'tackle', 'same', 'basic', 'plot', 'subject', 'matter', 'slightly', 'different', 'angles', 'are', 'worthy', 'admiration.In', 'mind', 'overall', 'feeling', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'one', 'isolation', 'main', 'characters', 'Oskar', 'Eli', 'stark', 'winter', 'landscapes', 'washed', 'out', 'colors', 'lack', 'emotion', 'shown', 'almost', 'protagonists', 'add', 'feeling', 'isolation', 'dreariness', 'despair', 'Let', 'Me', 'certainly', 'portion', 'time', 'isolation', 'Owen', 'who', 'connection', 'anyone', 'else', 'Abby', 'life', 'also', 'terror', 'Owen', 'think', 'Let', 'Me', 'better', 'job', 'detailing', 'fear', 'desperation', 'Owen', 'fear', 'desperation', 'justify', 'increasing', 'violent', 'actions', 'acceptance', 'such', 'actions', 'film', 'penultimate', 'scene', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'Oskar', 'was', 'oppressed', 'school', 'bullies', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'where', 'hatred', 'thirst', 'revenge', 'was', 'coming', 'from.The', 'other', 'thing', 'noticed', 'when', 'comparing', 'two', 'films', 'was', 'Let', 'Me', 'did', 'finer', 'jobs', 'detailing', 'budding', 'relationship', 'Owen', 'Abby', 'better', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'did', 'Oskar', 'Eli', 'was', 'never', 'fully', 'convinced', 'end', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'why', 'Oskar', 'Eli', 'ended', 'up', 'together', 'understood', 'perfectly', 'why', 'Owen', 'chose', 'stay', 'Abby', 'even', 'understood', 'implications', 'future', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'due', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Kodi', 'Smit-McPhee', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'lead', 'roles', 'perhaps', 'was', 'just', 'due', 'bit', 'being', 'lost', 'translation', 'Swedish', 'language', 'film', 'just', 'felt', 'connection', 'Owen', 'Abby', 'bit', 'more', 'Oskar', 'Eli.Now', 'not', 'meant', 'denigrate', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'think', 'original', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'lethargic', 'times', 'nevertheless', 'fine', 'movie', 'deserving', 'accolades', 'would', 'reiterate', 'Let', 'Me', 'outstanding', 'film', 'own', 'right']",N/A
1339891,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B003EYVXUU,J. B. Hoyos,"[3, 5]","Twelve-year-old Owen is mercilessly abused by his schoolmates.  He is befriended by a strange neighbor, Abby, who doesn't wear shoes in the snow; Abby has been twelve years old for a very long time and keeps insisting she's not a girl.  Abby is a vampire who feeds on her neighbors.  Victims of child abuse, Owen and Abby form a romantic bond that will eventually have tragic consequences.""Let Me In"" is a horror film that I would've enjoyed more if I hadn't already seen the original Swedish version ""Let the Right One In.""  ""Let the Right One In"" is a superb psychological horror film centered around lonely, troubled adolescents who can empathize with one another; based on the best-selling novel of the same title, it has developed a worldwide cult following.The acting in ""Let Me In"" is superb.  Child stars Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz give excellent performances.  However, the real surprise came from Richard Jenkins who gave an award-winning performance as the mild mannered music professor in ""The Visitor.""  Coincidentally, in ""The Visitor,"" Jenkins befriends and aids two illegal immigrants.  In ""Let Me In,"" he befriends and protects the vampire Abby and is even forced to kill for her.  These scenes were quite shocking.  From the commentary, we learn Jenkins performed all his own stunts.The plot for ""Let Me In"" is very similar to the one for ""Let the Right One In.""  Much of the dialogue, especially from Owen and Abby, was verbatim.  The major difference was the introduction of the policeman who replaces the role of the nosy, vindictive neighbor in ""Let the Right One In.""  The policeman made ""Let Me In"" more realistic; however, viewers developed a liking for the policeman's character.  The outcome of his investigation draws sympathy away from the children who are made to look more like evil villains rather than the ill-fated victims of the novel's intent.Despite the fact that ""Let Me In"" is a low-budget Hammer production (famous for their classic horror films of the late fifties to early seventies), the special effects are quite awesome.  The extra features on the DVD are required viewing.  They display the computer graphics used when Abby viciously attacks her victims and climbs trees, fences and hospital walls.  The elaborate car crash sequence was filmed outdoors using a cameraman mounted on the vehicle who was actually driving it; the scene was also filmed on stage in front of a blue screen and the vehicle was attached to a giant chicken rotisserie that spun it around and around.The commentary from Matt Reeves (visionary director of the innovative, groundbreaking ""Cloverfield"" - a gloomy, claustrophobic monster film as seen from the lens of a home video camera) is interesting and informative.  I was never bored.  It was unbelievable to learn what was actually filmed at Los Alamos, New Mexico, and what was created by computer graphics.  For example, remember when Jenkins attacks the boy at the railroad tracks?  The train never existed.  Also, from listening to Reeves, one learns more about Abby's background and why she keeps telling Owen that she is not a girl when he wants to date her.  One must watch the deleted scene titled ""Be Me.""  Actually, the entire film is about Owen empathizing with Abby's plight.  She kills in order to survive; however, Owen can't judge her because he fantasizes about killing Kenny and the other bullies.The viewer learns there are numerous instances of child abuse in ""Let Me In.""  Owen seems to suffer the most in the film.  He is psychologically harmed by his parents' divorce and is bullied at school by Kenny.  Kenny is bullied by his older brother; therefore, he relieves his pent-up anger and stress by abusing Owen.  Many years ago, Abby was forever physically traumatized by an elderly nun.  Now she is forced to feed on the blood of others.  ""Romeo and Juliet"" is a novel read by Owen and his classmates which is apropos to the film.  A tragedy, ""Romeo and Juliet"" mirrors the doomed romance of Owen and Abby; eventually, it will lead to tragedy.  The commentary suggests that Jenkins' character was once a twelve-year-old boy who developed a friendship with Abby.With the aid of a powerful magnifying glass, I read the full color miniature comic book, ""Let Me In: Crossroads,"" that was included with my copy of the DVD.  It has good illustrations.  The first of four in a new series, this comic is a prelude to the film.  Taking place in the farming community of Wellsville, Indiana, it gives Abby's guardian/protector a name, Thomas, and depicts more of Abby's vicious quest for blood.  Fans of the film may want to read this comic book series from Dark Horse Comics and Hammer.I would've enjoyed ""Let Me In"" more if Matt Reeves had made it more different from the Swedish film ""Let the Right One In.""  My dad said the same thing.  While watching the opening scenes of ""Let Me In,"" he asked, ""Didn't I see that boy and girl in another film?""  I told him we had watched ""Let the Right One In,"" which has the same plot.  Reeves should have taken into consideration the fans who had already seen ""Let the Right One In.""  Also, the gory finale of ""Let Me In"" would've been more enjoyable if the bullies hadn't turned the lights off in the pool house.  If it hadn't been for the commentary, I wouldn't have known exactly what had happened.  ""Let Me In"" is gorier and has superior special effects than ""Let the Right One In.""  However, the latter came first and has the element of surprise.I have no regrets watching ""Let Me In.""  I feel that I learned a lot more about the relationship between the vampire and the boy.  In order to learn the complete story, I feel compelled to read the novel ""Let the Right One In"" by John Ajvide Lindqvist.  According to Matt Reeves, the film would have to be a miniseries in order to give justice to the highly involved novel.  I have read Lindqvist's novel ""Handling the Undead,"" which is an expertly written psychological horror novel focusing on people's reactions upon learning their loved ones have returned from the grave.  ""Let Me In"" is required viewing if you want to delve deeper into the mystique of the Swedish horror sensation ""Let the Right One In.""Joseph B.

1339892,A3ADFUS74MLPMA,B003EYVXUU,"J. Bilby ""littlebibs""","[3, 4]","I've seen the original LET THE RIGHT ONE IN several times and it never fails to leave me uneasy, an other worldly masterpiece of  film making excellence. Everything about this was just about perfect. Much like the book, full of character studies and a slow paced winter dream. Having watched the new remake LET ME IN, I still can say this also is a wonderful journey into a macabre story that takes hold and never lets up. Closely following the original but with a bolder choice of settings, music and actors, LET ME IN will take you under its spell, its beautifully filmed, a love story of some sorts but a terrifying tale. This film takes out much of the ""other"" plots in the book and original and focuses all the energy on the young troubled boy and the girl and her caretaker that moves next door. Can't leave out the wonderful police detective as well!  I felt the acting and unusual story  make this remake a step above your usual vampire lore but I still will never get the original out of my head.

Would it keep integrity with the source material by John Lindqvist (writer)? Would it pander to American viewers with a sanitized MPAA censored distillation? Fortunately no to all of these. If you loved the original, (which I did) then this remake is a worthy bookend to the first. I highly recommend this film to fans of supernatural horror with a humanist sensibility. There are a few changes that are noteworthy: Abby is not a boy, but a girl; her father is not a pedophile but the previous young boy who fell in love with her; its set in New Mexico. Outside of these fairly major changes the film manages to keep true to the original Swedish movie and should not disappoint purists (like myself).",4,A worthy remake of a supernatural love story,1296950400,"02 6, 2011",2011,794,"['say', 'film', 'trepidation', 'Would', 'do', 'justice', 'original', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'Would', 'keep', 'integrity', 'source', 'material', 'John', 'Lindqvist', 'writer', 'Would', 'pander', 'American', 'viewers', 'sanitized', 'MPAA', 'censored', 'distillation', 'Fortunately', 'loved', 'original', 'did', 'then', 'remake', 'worthy', 'bookend', 'first', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'humanist', 'sensibility', 'are', 'few', 'changes', 'are', 'noteworthy', 'Abby', 'not', 'boy', 'girl', 'father', 'not', 'pedophile', 'previous', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'set', 'New', 'Mexico', 'fairly', 'major', 'changes', 'film', 'keep', 'true', 'original', 'Swedish', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'disappoint', 'purists']",N/A

You absolutly need to have every foreign film remade in its american version in order to appreciate it?Of course, ""Let Me In"", the U.S. version, has more of everything (more gore, more special effects, more explanations, more music) and less subtleties. Of course, like all american remake, it suffers from a sad case of hypocritical puritanism (those who saw the sweedish version know what i'm refering to).Instead of wasting his precious talent in remaking a foreign cult film (a nevertheless great remake that is uncalled for), the american director should have done an original story. Of course, he changed the structure a bit so that he can say that his version is different (the arguable and overlong mystery surrounding a secondary character as the movie begins). And also, he took away a little detail that was so eerie and cool in the european version: Eli, the sweedish girl vampire, flys in an fast, subtle and elegant way as she goes from a module to her new friend (the american Abby simply jumps out of focus). Why take away such a spooky detail?And as good as Chloe Moretz is as Abby, the american girl vampire, and she is sublime, i feel that Lina Leandersson is way more ""peculiar"" in her ways and her looks in the european version. Those who've seen ""Let The Right One In"" have to give me that one. The sweedish boy was also more ""natural"", i feel. Is look was ""picturesque"" if i may say so but it belonged in the story. The american boy, Kodi Smith-McPhee, is good and i believed him, but it feels like he was cast more because he looked like his european counterpart, Kare Hedebrant.No really, the sweedish version has absolutly NOTHING to be ashamed of. Nothing. It is as good as it can be. The special effects, the acting, the structure and the cinematography are superb. And it is only two or three years old. It certainly didn't need a remake. The U.S. version, as good as it may be (and it is good), almost feels like an insult to the intelligence of the american viewers.You don't believe me? Try and find a way to see the sweedish version.

1339897,AG7XI6B33D9QK,B003EYVXUU,Jeffrey S. Lybarger,"[3, 6]","Let's get one thing clear immediately; Let Me In is a superb film that is beautifully shot and the actors, specifically the two very young leads, are perfection. Kodi Smit-McPhee, who plays Owen, the physically weak young boy who is under constant attack from three older boys, is so real and so believable that you can't help but feel for him and you, as the viewer, either fall into one of two categories; you are either reminded of him because you were like him... or because you once, long ago, tormented some kid in the way that he is tormented.Chloe Grace Moretz, the beautiful and amazingly talented young girl who is both Abby and Vampire, is so captivating and stunning in this role that it will certainly be a daunting task for her to ever out-do herself here. However... I have a feeling that we have only been witness to the beginning of her skills as an actress.By now you should know the history of this movie and what it is based on... w/ out regurgitating all of that yet again, let me just say that this movie will pull you into its story and you won't even realize it while it's happening. The pacing in this film is perfect. Subtle things happen that are so wonderful that you really need to view this movie multiple times to take them all in.Without giving away any spoilers for those who have not seen this yet I will just say that one of my favorite parts is when Abby is talking to Owen about the bullies at school. She tells him he has to hit back. Hard. Owen keeps making excuses and asking 'What if it doesn't work?' Abby then tells him, 'I'll help you.' He says, ""But you're a girl.'She then gently reaches out her hand and touches him and says, 'I'm a lot stronger than you think.' The look on her face in that moment is priceless and difficult to properly convey in words, but it is film making at its finest.Over time Owen begins to unravel the mysteries of young Abby and though he is scared... even calling his soon-to-be-divorced father and asking him if evil is real... he also realizes that he loves Abby. After yet another attack by his tormentors at the school swimming pool, Owen is saved by Abby and Owen realizes he has only one choice... to spend his life with her.It's difficult for me to characterize this as a *Horror* movie, because it is also a love story and a coming-of-age movie. Don't let that deter you though... this is one of those rare times when a movie crosses genres and succeeds on all levels. I rented this and watched it 3 times, returned it and bought the DVD.

Once the end titles began, I was convinced that this is the BEST vampire tale ever put on screen since ""Interview With The Vampire"" some 16 years ago. This is how vampires should be portrayed...tragic and lonely figures cursed by their affliction and immortality. Sure..we've seen the current trends of highly stylized and hip vampires that ""glitter in the sun"" or look like they came off the cover of Teen People magazine. They're over-romanticized and make you want to be one of them, as opposed to fearing and, more importantly, pitying them.I have a hard time classifying this as a ""horror"" film. It's got a fair share of frights, but the real story here is one of innocence lost and the naivite of young love. The relationship between Owen and Abby is one that is severely lacking in todays society where we tend to oversexualize our pre-teens to the point of nausea. Theirs is a sweet and self-sacrificing kind of love that is genuinely the heart of this film. It's a beautiful love story between two kids that is wrapped up in ""horror film"" packaging.Chloe Moretz is going to be HUGE one day. Her performance as Abby is incredible and earnest. She plays the part of a person of considerable years, yet trapped in the body of a child, perfectly. You see it in her eyes and in every inflection of her tone when she speaks. She IS Abby in this film.Kodi Smit-McPhee, for an Australian actor, really does his part well for his age. It's his story that actually provide the hardest parts to watch with regards to his torment at the hands of some school punks. He's odd looking, off puting, and a bit dark..but you immediately sympathize with him and his circumstances.The adult cast, while solid and well established actors, really take a back seat to these two fine young actors.I've no doubt the original Swedish film is just as wonderful and I look forward to seeing it, but when the author himself states that this version is another superbly executed telling of his original novel and screenplay, then I'll take his word for it.If nothing else....it's great to finally know what happens to a vampire that enters a home uninvited.

As someone who enjoys foreign films and is not intimidated by sub-titles, I actually prefer foreign language versions to any dubbed effort. Well I was treated to one of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen. Beautiful, sad, horrific and  yes, erotic, I also saw one the of the best vampire films ...EVER! There was a gorgeous subtlety and visceral impact to the effects in LTROI. Let Me In (LMI), which I had to and did watch ASAP, took most of its cues from the original, but was still a thoroughly enjoyable film in its own right... And it brought out two very important aspects that I missed (?) in the original LTROI.... Firstly when Abby/Eli tells Owen/Oskar, ""I'm not a girl"" I simply thought she/he was referring to the fact that she/he is not human, i.e. ""I'm not a girl, I'm a vampire..."" (Also in LTROI intially I thought the actress Lina Liandersson was a boy!) But a scene in LTROI where we see a quick shot of a scar on Eli's lower abdomen combined with Matt Reeves commentary on the deleted scenes for LMI was that Abby/Eli was in fact a castrated young boy... I have not as yet read the original novel, which I assume will give more details as to Abby/Eli's origin... It's next on my reading list... Secondly I almost gasped while watching LMI that a key item I missed while watching LTROI was when I realized that Abby was not just befriending Owen as a kindred soul but in fact was recruiting him as her next ""Caretaker""... Abby/Eli has lived for hundreds of years and has had probably a dozen caretakers, humans who protect them during their vulnerable times like Straker in Salem's Lot, and who eventually grow old and die (or burn themselves into unrecognizable states with acid). In LTROI we see the caretaker simply grow old and careless and completely incapable of completing his duties while in LMI we see the caretaker become bitter and angry at his incompetence and yet both endlessly love their charges to the point of offering themselves for feeding before dying. Owen/Oskar has now become Abby/Eli's new ""love"" and will transport her/him and enable her/him to survive... Absolutely brilliant...PS When Eli/Abby's caretaker asks her/him not to see that boy again, is it concern or jealousy?

In fact the author approved of this movie as a respectful re-adaption of the novel, this is Hammer's first movie in many years since the 70's as they are back in business. The film's acting is truly terrific even by Elias Koteas who plays the police officer in this movie and there's some good gore effects that are well done, it's also a kind of retro movie that takes you back to the 80's as there is even some pop songs from that time like David Bowie's Let's Dance and it's a very respectable remake that does things as both the same (But not all the way like that horrible Psycho remake) and new in some parts. It's by far one of the best horror remakes of all time as it earned it's critical acclaim, watch both films of Let The Right One In and this one at the same time to see how good both are.

Never have I been glued to a screen when not much is happening as I was here.The direction and cinematrography were exceptional. The snowy backdrop to the fiery story was a constrast for the induction of perfection. And in that snowy world we find a pre-teen love story between a boy and a girl vampire made all the more passionate by the seclusion and implied desolation of those surroundings. It was clear that Writer/Directior Matt Reeves' (Cloverfield) heart was in it from the word 'Go'.Casting and acting couldn't have been better either. The two pre-teen leads, Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) of ""The Road"" and Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) of ""Kick-Ass"" were outstanding. Love between children of 12 years of age usually seems out of place and awkward, not so here. You could feel the passion they had for one another, and you could fully understand the disappointment Abby felt in her inability to be a girl with a boyfriend leading the normal life of a child.The entirety of ""Let Me In"" was shrouded in sadness, but that was okay. It was tolerable and needed. There were references to Romeo & Juliet, and that, I'm sure was to imbue the understanding of the sadness in that story in parallel to this one.

1339915,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B003EYVXUU,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[14, 15]","I adore the Swedish film Let the Right One In and I was highly skeptical about the idea of an Americanized remake. The original was such a poetic, touching film I wondered how anyone could hope to improve on it. When it was announced that the director of Cloverfield was behind it and the title had been dumbed-down for American audiences (I realize that translations being what they are, the title may be appropriate, but you can't deny it sounds like a dumbed-down version of the original), I lost all faith in it until director Matt Reeves cast two of the most talented child actors working today. Whenever a film is remade, I watch it and judge it on its own merit. When reviewing a remake I don't like to compare it with the original, but I found it impossible to not break my own rule several times here.The setting is Los Alamos, New Mexico, 1983. Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a 12-year-old boy, seemingly with no friends, frequently bullied at school, and with no supporting parent figure to come home to. One night, outside his apartment building, Owen meets a young girl named Abby (Chlo Moretz), who has just moved in next door with a mysterious man that Owen assumes is her father (Richard Jenkins). It's no spoiler to tell you that Abby is a vampire.Character actor Elias Koteas plays a policeman, who is basically a composite character of several minor characters from the Swedish version. While it's not a shot-for-shot remake, Reeves sticks very close to the Swedish film. Since I've never read the book, I can't be sure that additional elements in this film are Reeves' own ideas or simply ideas taken from the book so I ask you to forgive me if I credit him with something that should be credited to the novelist John Ajvide Lindqvist.So, what has changed? Obviously the setting has moved from Sweden to New Mexico. Some of have commented that since Reeves didn't differentiate from the look of the Swedish version this change was pointless. I'm not offended by it as it doesn't change the story at all. The characters names have changed from Oskar and Eli to Owen and Abby. Once again, I find no quarrel here as their names aren't intact but their character is. Owen and Abby don't differ very much in character from their foreign counterparts and I like that Reeves didn't attempt to tweak with the characterization. Structurally, it's been altered too; the opening scene is changed, which seems to just be a way to capture the attention of an American audience quicker. Let Me In begins with a bang, while Let the Right One In draws you in as it progresses. The bullies portrayed here are much more loathsome, as they appeared more childlike is the Swedish version. Rather than show Owen's father as an alcoholic (do we need another alcoholic father in American movies?), Reeves largely removes his involvement and in a brilliant creative flourish chooses to illustrate Owen's disconnected relationship with his mother by obscuring her face whenever she's onscreen. The look of this film is a bit more monotonous, while scenes with the father (called Hkan in the original, but anonymous here) are played out with more suspense. There's an impressively shot car crash that, in context, I thought worked much better than the ""entering the bathroom in defeat"" scene from the original. In one moment where Owen simply finds a picture, Reeves adds a much deeper level to the relationship between the father and Abby.Reeves does use a bit more CGI, but he doesn't overuse it. I think Reeves knew he couldn't make the scene where Abby meets a victim under a bridge any more poetic, so he attempted to make it, at least more, creepier. I did not approve of the decision to give Abby such a vampiric look when she feeds. The look was much more subtle and effective previously. Also, the pool scene was executed (no pun intended) much better in the original as it was simultaneously horrifying and darkly humorous. Here, it's just a dark scene (but not in the sense that it's not well-lit). Despite these changes (and despite your feelings on these changes), Reeves doesn't keep the beauty and poetry of the original intact but brings his own poetic beauty to it, really proving his merit as a capable director.Now let's talk about the acting, beginning with Richard Jenkins. This is a highly underrated character actor who has appeared in a lot of movies (including such cinematic fecal matter as Step Brothers, among other things), but he's rarely given a role that allows him to really shine. With hardly any additional screen-time than his foreign counterpart (actor Per Ragnar), Jenkins gives a much creepier, more effective, and ultimately more sympathetic performance. He brings new life to this character that simply wasn't present before. Beyond those two performances, I will not compare any others. McPhee does a convincing, identifiable interpretation of his character and gives a performance that is more emotionally mature than you'd expect from someone who is fourteen (at the time of this writing). Moretz is a revelation in what is arguably her most mature role yet. At thirteen (as of this writing), Moretz has racked up an impressive filmography and, as Abby, she demonstrates that she's an immensely talented actress, capable of conveying emotions way beyond her years. If acting is her passion and she sticks to it, I can see her making real waves in the film industry and being the recipient of many film awards as she gets older. I don't recall seeing a performance by a child actor that impressed me this much. While many will compare her performance with Lina Leandersson's, I encourage those people to look at Moretz at face-value. This is an actress of infinite talent.Let Me In was released to theatres in October of 2010, only four months after the third film in the Twilight Saga became a box office phenomenon. Unlike that film, Let Me In underperformed at the box office. It's a tragedy that such emotionally retarded films like Twilight do phenomenal business at the box office but something this poignant makes no impact. I mention this because fans seem to flock to human-vampire romances, yet the lesser one makes 10x the money. Let Me In is a love story, but not in any traditional, straight-forward sort of way. This adolescent love story has no kissing, no physical intimacy, and no dreary, contrived romanticizing yet is more poignant, romantic, and sweeter than Twilight while simultaneously achieving more emotional resonance than that saga could ever hope for. The fact that Moretz and McPhee, at 13 and 14, bring more pathos to their ""romance"" than the entire adult cast of Twilight says a lot about the childish idiots that populate that movie.It's a remake, yes but it's one of the best horror films and one of the best vampire films to come out of Hollywood in a while. Let Me In is an admirable film that would be much more respected if it wasn't a remake. Few remakes live up to the original film while almost rivaling it as successfully as Let Me In does. Those not familiar with the original Swedish film should seek it out, but whether you're a big fan of the original or were completely unaware of it's existence I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by this film.GRADE: A-",5,Thoughts on A Well-Rendered Remake (And a Rant Against Twilight),1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,7236,"['adore', 'Swedish', 'film', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'was', 'highly',

1339922,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B003EYVXUU,K. Driscoll,"[4, 8]","The cynic in me hates the reasons for recreating one of 2008's greatest films,Let The Right One Inor Lt den r&auml;tte komma in, an absolutely perfect romantic horror film that didn't need to be remade at all, much less only two years later.  The reasons are simple; the American audience that fills up theaters is much less likely to show up to a film that is in Swedish and lacks the special effects hooks and quasi-starpower of this remake.  Regardless if it is a remake or not, Let the Right One In is a superior film and I preface this review of its Americanized remake with the highest recommendation I can possibly give to the original.  However, do not let this play down entirely the fact that Let Me In is overall a terrifically disturbing and enjoyable horror film in its own right.The film takes place in Los Alamos, New Mexico and follows a sad twelve year old outcast named Owen (called Oskar in the 2008 movie).  Owen is neglected by his selfish parents and abused, sometimes brutally, by his peers at school.  He's easy to like but has some quirks that really put his relationship with the audience under scrutiny.  Owen is played by Kodi Smit-McPhee who won't get the credit his co-star Chloe Moretz will get in many circles but deserves it just the same.  Owen gets a new neighbor in Abby (played by Moretz, who was great earlier this year as Hit Girl in the super hero action comedyKick-Ass), a strange girl who doesn't wear shoes in the snow and seems altogether careless about her appearance.  Owen and Abby grow to have a wonderful relationship and although the film's sense of romance didn't hook me in as deeply as the original film did, it still works.  The major obstacle to Owen and Abby's budding friendship is simple; she is a vampire.  The supporting cast is great here and the although Elias Koteas's character was not present in the 2008 film, he is a welcome addition if only for the fact that this guy is a such a fantastic actor.  Richard Jenkins, an actor who dominated every frame of another great 2008 filmThe Visitor, plays the role of Abby's ""father"" and protector.  He is, as always, amazing.I have to give director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) credit for giving this story the respect it deserves.  He is a very good filmmaker and knows how to make an audience uncomfortable while also connecting to the characters.  He loses some points for taking on a project that either he or the producers merely intended to cash in on, and despite having some meticulous aesthetic strengths he only imitates the over powering atmosphere of the original film.  I don't like some of the special effects used for Abby, in particular the obvious use of CGI, but others will.  I didn't like that the film pulled some punches in areas that might make a more broad audience uncomfortable.  On the other hand I thought that one scene in particular was actually an improvement from the original.  Still, the original can't be touched and shame on them for trying.

While they are very similar (obviously), I just feel the original put the story together so much better.  The relationship between the two central characters seemed much more natural and realistic in the original.  I think that the actress playing ""Abby"" in this version is trying to be creepy.  Also, the CGI when she attacks someone is really not very good.  The movements are disjointed and not fluid.  Being that the shots were usually from a distance, why not just get a gymnast to hop around and do the stunts?  For example, when she climbed the tree it looked awful.One thing I did prefer in this version over the original is that the kid playing the main bully was actually better.  Also, Owen/Oscar in this version, while not ""better"" than the original was pretty good and convincing.Abby vs. Eli is no contest as I mentioned earlier.  Eli in the original is MUCH better!  Also, the cinematography of the original and the snowy landscapes were fantastic.  This version has that slightly washed out ""scary"" look that actually takes you out of the movie more than putting you in the movie.I'm not a huge fan of remakes, but I'm not a guy that decides I won't like something just because it is a remake.

Life is very hard for him, and he feels lonely much of the time. One day he befriends a girl living in a nearby apartment. She keeps him company, and gives him confidence. She also puts an end to the bullying he is suffering from. There is something not right about this girl. He learns that she is a vampire. Her secret shocks him, but he wants to stay with her regardless.This is a pretty cute love story about two children. It also has a heavy helping of violence and darkness. I really enjoyed it. It does have a depressing vibe about it, but it's a different take on the vampire theme. It explores the love between a vampire girl and a human boy.

1339928,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,B003EYVXUU,Kevin F. Tasker,"[3, 6]","The vampire mythology is as old as the hills. Hollywood has spent nearly a century cataloguing all of the different facets of the crypt-sleeping, fanged beasts of the night. From Nosferatu to John Carpenter's Vampires to Twilight, the gamut has been run...and run...and run. In fact, this film is just a remake of a foreign success. So does it stand on its own two feet? Yes. Thanks to its deft production and characters. LET ME IN is a dazzling, morbid little picture with two stellar young leads at its center and while it does occasionally wallow in bucket-loads of gore, it has something of a real heart as well.That's not to say that it isn't dark as dark can be. It is. The visuals are stark and haunting. From the opening frame of a cavalcade of police cars and an ambulance jouncing through snowy hills at night, to the violent finale, this is a film that positively immersed viewers in its grim world. This is not a film for children. It contains overwhelmingly graphic blood-letting sequences and one very nasty facial burn. There is also a cycle-of-abuse subplot that doesn't end in what one might call a ""healthy"" fashion. Overall, there is a lot of tension to be had in the film. Several scenes are stand-alone and amazing, begging for repeat viewing. One encounter at a gas station is rewind-right-away and re-watch good.The lead characters are amazing. Chloe (Hit-Girl) Mortiz knocks this one out of the park. She is believable, graceful, and just plain captivating. The boy keeps up. The old detective and the father are also very convincing. Their shopworn character-action vibes suited the tone of the film. Though their relationship is the definition of unnatural, the two young kids will have most audience members feeling for their plight by the time the credits roll. It is amazing that they are as young as they are and able to convey such adult emotion.This is a very dreary but paradoxically energetic film with a lot of surprises and an excellent score. The production values rock. The story is rather fresh and engaging.

1339931,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003EYVXUU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","For the record, I was absolutely opposed to the idea of an American remake of the remarkable existential Swedish chiller ""Let the Right One In."" A contemplative look at friendship, loyalty and forging connections, this vampire film eschewed conventional horror to work as a thoughtful character study. With much quiet and intimacy, this was no ordinary blood bath--this was a serious attempt to conceptualize vampires in a modern context. Sure, there were moments of genuine creepiness and scares, but there was much more underneath the surface. Mainstream American horror films seldom do subtle and/or understated themes, so I prepared for the worst when Matt Reeves' ""Let Me In"" was announced. But, to my astonishment and delight, Reeves understood what made the original unique and special. With full integrity intact, this remake is supremely successful.The story centers around an awkward and lonely youth (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who spends many nights in isolation. One night, he's approached by an enigmatic new neighbor (Chloe Grace Moretz) of similar age. Although she seems equally alone, she proclaims that they can't be friends. However, the two seem drawn to one another and, in fact, start to become close. But this tentative juvenile romance has one striking difference--Moretz is a vampire. Her dietary needs are met by Richard Jenkins who seems to be part guardian, part accomplice, part slave. When bodies start to be discovered and Moretz's daily routine gets interrupted, things start to spiral out of control. Are our young couple doomed? And can Smit-McPhee accept the truth of his new friendship?Part of what makes this film so great is the attention to character. The film is infused with a genuine melancholy and sadness--and the only respite from the gloom is in the friendship the two characters create. She needs the human connection, he needs her strength--and together they grow stronger. Their bond makes them both better for it as he struggles with bullying at school and she struggles for survival itself. Underplayed to perfection, Moretz turns in her second tremendous performance of 2010 (this is world's away from the over-the-top, but terrific, Hit Girl). And Smit-McPhee is a revelation as this role fits him to a tee. The quiet interplay between the kids is fascinating, believable, and heart wrenching.There are still some good scares, however, for those that groan at the idea of a pre-teen love story. Jenkins carries the bulk of the action as he finds likely victims. One sequence, shot entirely from the interior of a moving car, is one of the most spectacular action set pieces of the year.

This is how the story goes: Twelve-year old Owen is viciously bullied by his classmates and neglected by his divorcing parents. Achingly lonely, Owen spends his days plotting revenge on his middle school tormentors and his evenings spying on the other inhabitants of his apartment complex. His only friend is his new neighbor Abby, an eerily self-possessed young girl who lives next door with her silent father. A frail, troubled child about Owen's age, Abby emerges from her heavily curtained apartment only at night and always barefoot, seemingly immune to the bitter winter elements. Recognizing a fellow outcast, Owen opens up to her and before long, the two have formed a unique bond. When a string of grisly murders puts the town on high alert, Abby's father disappears, and the terrified girl is left to fend for herself. Still, she repeatedly rebuffs Owen's efforts to help her and her increasingly bizarre behavior leads the imaginative Owen to suspect she's hiding an unthinkable secret.The cast led by Kodi Smit-Mcphee (as Owen) & Chloe Grace Moretz (as Abby), who, both give, excellent performances, is excellent!

1339934,A30IP5D5DLHRPA,B003EYVXUU,Kyle Slayzar,"[7, 8]","I'll admit that I went into this film expecting just another stupid vampire film.  Like zombies in video games, every big film these days just has to have vampires and it's all thanks to Twilight and Friends.  It has become the comedy staple of many satires (including the horribly made Vampires Suck) and online parodies that makes any member of the general audience just roll their eyes when they hear about a film coming out about vampires.  Because of this established norm, my friends and I scheduled a movie night hoping to heckle or ""riff"" the hell out of Let Me In just like we had done with Sharktopus the week prior.When the credits rolled and we all looked at each other, we made the startling observation that we had not really done any riffing at all.  We got a few jabs in early on during the opening scene in the hospital (they were Dirty Harry references BTW), but they quickly began to trail off as the film went on.  We began to get drawn into the film and soon the entire audience, myself included, just watched the film intently.  We enjoyed it, thoroughly and couldn't believe what had just transpired.The film has a very basic premise, forbidden love between a bullied preteen kid and a girl vampire (this ISN'T a spoiler as it's written in the description and on the back of the box).  It kinda reminds me of any Disney film pertaining to forbidden love but much, much, MUCH more graphic.  Definitely not for kids (the falling body parts in the pool at the end of the film put this one over the top for an ""R"" rating).  The love part isn't overdone like it is in Twilight and the characters are real people, not hairless musclebound teenagers that use any excuse to take their shirts off.  It's a cute little love story.Now, normally I am very black and white on villains, killers, moral vagrants, etc. in that I believe one must atone for their mistakes in one way or another.  However, despite the vampire character randomly attacking and killing innocent people, I couldn't help but feel sorry for her since it's in her nature.  She is no more guilty than an alligator taking a victim that got too close to the water in a swamp.  It also adds to the character development of both the boy (I never could remember names) and the vampire as they struggle with this horrific truth and try to go on with their lives.  It kept us reeled in.Now, I did not see the original so I cannot comment on whether it is better, worse, or about the same.  While I never pass up a good foreign film such as Das Boot, My Sassy Girl (the Korean version), or any good anime, this one slipped under my radar.  Sorry.All in all, I was very impressed with this one.  I might actually show my girlfriend this one and that's a big deal since I've only shown her my favorites.

The vampire in this film, called Abby and played by Chloe Grace Moretz, is an attractive child.  The vampire in this movie needs a human to exist, for food, much like ""Dracula"". Here is where the elements of ""Twilight"" come in-the vampire develops a relationship with one, special human, who helps the vampire get ""food"" (blood) for survival.  Humans that have interactions with vampires in books or on film most of the time are portrayed as being normal, moral beings who develop feelings for the vampire (because of their beauty, personality, etc.). In this movie this is not the case-Owen the human child is bullied, but he secretly has a fascination with violence and murder.  He is in many ways like the vampire Abby, but he is afraid to act on his murderous intentions.  When they meet they compliment one another in developing Owen as a potential murderer to help replace the character played by Richard Jenkins who ""helped"" Chloe kill people to obtain their blood. Abby and Owen develop a ""love"" style relationship which is both exciting and grotesque to watch.This film was fascinating to me.  As a fan of the book ""Let the right one in"" by John Ajvide Linquist that this movie was based on I knew I would love it.  This movie sets a dark mood unmatched by many horror movies-you watch the entire film with a sense of dread that never eases.  The cast is excellent.

Unlike the other two movies, there is no historical context to the characters and story.  It's a movie about a 12 year old girl (vampire) who's been twelve for a very long time and a twelve year old boy who is lonely, facing his parents' divorce and the local bullies at school.  The director captured the mid 1980s well:  clothing, music, arcade/video games, etc and yet, there is a timeless quality to the film. The scene with the rubik cube is just wonderful and Owen's delight at finding the completed cube (and possible new friend) the next morning is special.  The two young actors are truly the stars of the film and their interactions  with each other elevates this film to another level beyond being just another vampire movie.  The film contains some scenes of intense but subtle violence and yet, some very tender scenes.  The relationship between Abby and Owen is a symbiotic one and yet, there is an underlying current of affection, dare one say love.  They both need each other for very different reasons and yet, it comes off so natural in the film.  I found the director's emphasis on Abby's feet a clever and unique aspect of the film.

All that changed with a well received Swedish film called LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.As with most movies that have success that come from foreign markets, Hollywood made the decision to remake it as an English language film in the hopes of attracting a wider audience. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. For me, this one works and works well. And for viewers who would rather not follow subtitles this movie should do the trick.Directed by CLOVERFIELD director Matt Reeves it's not so much a remake of the movie as it in an interpretation of the book. Reeves has gone on to say that he spoke with the author and found that his take on the book was what the author was attempting to discuss which was going through the awkward teen years set in a vampire story. It clicks here and Reeves does a great job.Set in Los Alamos, New Mexico, we find ourselves in the midst of winter. Young Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a small boy prone to being bullied while at school. Living with his mother (a woman trapped in her own problems with a failed marriage, devout religious follower and alcoholic in training) Owen leads a lonely life. There are no other kids in their apartment complex and he spends most of his time sitting on the frozen playground outside in the snow. Until a new neighbor shows up.Rarely seen this new neighbor moves into the apartment next door and at times Owen can hear conversations through the walls. The only person he sees is an older man (Richard Jenkins) who goes in and out of the apartment. Then one night Owen meets Abby (Chloe Moretz) who lets him know up front that they can't be friends. But friends they do become.Owen confides in her about the bullying at school. She advises him to just take the bully on up front, that he'll back down once Owen lets himself stop being pushed around. She also lets him know that if need be she'll be there to back him up.What Owen doesn't know is that Abby is a vampire. The man she lives with isn't really her father but the man who takes care of her, supplying her with fresh blood that he extracts from victims he kills and then drains. When a draining goes wrong, Owen can hear two voices arguing, neither of which sounds like a child. Due to this accident, Abby is forced to go out and feed on her own.Owen and Abby become close friends. Both lead lonely lives but find comfort in one another's company. Each is the companion the other thought they'd never have. But would this be the case if Owen truly knew what Abby was?While this story unfolds the police are searching for the savage killer on the streets. The bullies continue to give Owen a hard time as we wait to see if he calls their bluff. And the time draws near where we discover if Abby will reveal herself to Owen or not. And if she does, what will be his response?The surface of this movie is a horror film with a few gory moments tossed in for those fans but a more horrifying tale that smolders beneath. It's less about the attacks and bloodshed of the vampire and more about what it takes to survive, especially while being 12 years old for so long. Gone is the romantic adolescent version of vampirism and in its place a deeper story of what it's like to be lonely in the middle of a world full of people.Each actor does a fantastic job, most importantly the two young leads. For either of them to carry the weight and depth of their characters is something worth watching, for both of them to do so is amazing. Jenkins does a good job but is relegated to little in this film. And Elias Koteas as the detective searching for a killer does a tremendous job.It seems that many horror fans have taken a liking to blood drenched horror that offers multiple mutilations these days. For those that like something to think about, that plays as much with your mind as it does your stomach, this is a movie that will whet your appetite. The pacing may be slow, but there's a reason for that. This is a story that unfolds rather than slaps you in the face. And a good story at that.",4,VAMPIRE WITH A BITE,1296432000,"01 31, 2011",2011,4248,"['past', 'few', 'years', 'vampire', 'film', 'changed', 'what', 'began', 'horrifying', 'creature', 'seductive', 'animal', 'followed', 'more', 'creatures', 'finally', 'TWILIGHT', 'films', 'vampire', 'more', 'interested', 'seduction', 'say', 'draining', 'blood', 'changed', 'well', 'received', 'Swedish', 'film', 'called', 'LET', 'THE', 'RIGHT', 'ONE', 'IN.As', 'most', 'movies', 'have', 'success', 'come', 'foreign', 'markets', 'Hollywood', 'made', 'decision', 'remake', 'English', 'language', 'film', 'hopes', 'attracting', 'wider', 'audience', ""n't"", 'one', 'works', 'well', 'viewers', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'follow', 'subtitles', 'movie', 'should', 'do', 'trick.Directed', 'CLOVERFIELD', 'director', 'Matt', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'remake', 'movie', 'interpretation', 'book', 'gone', 'say', 'spoke', 'author', 'found', 'take', 'book', 'was', 'what', 'author', 'was', 'attempting', 'discuss', 'was', 'going', 'awkward', 'teen', 'years', 'set', 'vampire', 'story', 'here', 'Reeves', 'great', 'job.Set', 'Los', 'Alamos', 'New', 'Mexico', 'find', 'midst', 'winter', 'Young', 'Owen', 'Kodi', 'Smit-McPhee', 'small', 'boy', 'prone', 'being', 'bullied', 'school', 'Living', 'mother', 'woman', 'trapped', 'own', 'problems', 'failed', 'marriage', 'devout', 'religious', 'follower', 'alcoholic', 'training', 'Owen', 'lonely', 'life', 'are', 'other', 'kids', 'apartment', 'complex', 'most', 'time', 'sitting', 'frozen', 'playground', 'snow', 'new', 'neighbor', 'shows', 'up.Rarely', 'seen', 'new', 'neighbor', 'moves', 'apartment', 'next', 'door', 'times', 'Owen', 'can', 'hear', 'conversations', 'walls', 'only', 'person', 'older', 'man', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'who', 'apartment', 'Then', 'one', 'night', 'Owen', 'Abby', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'who', 'know', 'up', 'front', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'friends', 'do', 'confides', 'bullying', 'school', 'just', 'take', 'bully', 'front', ""'ll"", 'back', 'down', 'once', 'Owen', 'lets', 'stop', 'being', 'pushed', 'also', 'know', 'need', 'be', ""'ll"", 'be', 'there', 'back', 'up.What', 'Owen', ""n't"", 'know', 'Abby', 'vampire', 'man', ""n't"", 'really', 'father', 'man', 'who', 'care', 'supplying', 'fresh', 'blood', 'victims', 'then', 'drains', 'When', 'draining', 'wrong', 'Owen', 'can', 'hear', 'two', 'voices', 'arguing', 'child', 'Due', 'accident', 'Abby', 'forced', 'go', 'out', 'feed', 'own.Owen', 'Abby', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'lead', 'lonely', 'lives', 'find', 'comfort', 'one', 'company', 'companion', 'other', 'thought', ""'d"", 'never', 'have', 'would', 'be', 'case', 'Owen', 'truly', 'knew', 'what', 'Abby', 'was', 'story', 'police', 'are', 'searching', 'savage', 'killer', 'streets', 'bullies', 'continue', 'give', 'Owen', 'hard', 'time', 'wait', 'see', 'bluff', 'time', 'draws', 'where', 'discover', 'Abby', 'will', 'reveal', 'Owen', 'not', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'response', 'surface', 'movie', 'horror', 'film', 'few', 'gory', 'moments', 'tossed', 'fans', 'more', 'horrifying', 'tale', 'smolders', 'beneath', 'less', 'attacks', 'bloodshed', 'vampire', 'more', 'what', 'survive', 'especially', 'being', '12', 'years', 'old', 'so', 'long', 'Gone', 'romantic', 'adolescent', 'version', 'vampirism', 'place', 'deeper', 'story', 'what', 'be', 'lonely', 'middle', 'world', 'full', 'people.Each', 'actor', 'fantastic', 'job', 'most', 'importantly', 'two', 'young', 'leads', 'carry', 'weight', 'depth', 'characters', 'something', 'worth', 'watching', 'do', 'so', 'amazing', 'Jenkins', 'good', 'job', 'relegated', 'little', 'film', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'detective', 'searching', 'killer', 'tremendous', 'job.It', 'many', 'horror', 'fans', 'have', 'taken', 'liking', 'blood', 'drenched', 'horror', 'multiple', 'mutilations', 'days', 'like', 'something', 'think', 'as', 'much', 'mind', 'stomach', 'movie', 'will', 'whet', 'appetite', 'pacing', 'may', 'be', 'slow', 'reason', 'story', 'rather', 'slaps', 'face', 'good', 'story']",N/A

I watch many movies, searching for the ones that I can recommend to my friends and co-workers without hesitation; this one is on that short list. To classify it as ""yet another vampire movie"" is incorrect; it is a dark, romantic story that happens to have a vampire in it. The acting is superb. The story is very much in line with the original. If you prefer movies that utilize plot, pacing, and story to achieve success, then watch this. If you prefer movies that are as shallow as a reality television celebrity, see something else. My apologies to the people who made ""Snakes on a Plane."" I enjoyed it even though I was ridiculed by my wife and daughter for purchasing it; it didn't require much thought, but was entertaining.

Bartelt ""buyer of stuff""","[3, 4]","I seriously suggest that you watch Let the Right One In first.All of the subtle overtones, motivation and beautiful cinematography is captured by the original.  For nearly identical scripts and dialogue, both movies get things right... and wrong.I like the pacing of Let Me In much better, however the US version is so much more superficial and melodramatic than the original.  Let Me In is a great movie, but it's very Americanized.  Eli in Let the Right One In is manipulative, in Let Me In she is portrayed more innocently.  The father becomes detached and pretty much commits suicide due to jealousy of Eli and the young boy, an undertone pretty much missing from the remake.  Also, the story dealing with the woman who turns into a vampire is much more meaningful in the original... In Let Me In, she is quickly killed off.  Let the Right One In explores her becoming, and her eventual suggested suicide.  The scene where she is attacked by cats in the original never made it to Let Me In, and that scene was fantastic, but it really didn't do much for the original plot line.  It did help portray what happens when one becomes a vampire, so in this aspect, removing this story from Let Me In detracts it from being the pure vampire movie everyone says it is.  The original is much better at this than Let Me In.I honestly like both movies about the same for very different reasons.  They're both keepers and it's amazing that a remake so recently done after the original could be so successful.",5,Don't let the wrong one in?,1311465600,"07 24, 2011",2011,1500,"['seriously', 'suggest', 'watch', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'first.All', 'subtle', 'overtones', 'motivation', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'captured', 'original', 'nearly', 'identical', 'scripts', 'dialogue', 'movies', 'get', 'things', 'right', 'wrong.I', 'pacing', 'Let', 'Me', 'much', 'better', 'however', 'US', 'version', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'superficial', 'melodramatic', 'original', 'Let', 'Me', 'great', 'movie', 'very', 'Americanized', 'Eli', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'manipulative', 'Let', 'Me', 'portrayed', 'more', 'innocently', 'father', 'detached', 'pretty', 'much', 'commits', 'suicide', 'due', 'jealousy', 'Eli', 'young', 'boy', 'undertone', 'pretty', 'much', 'missing', 'remake', 'Also', 'story', 'dealing', 'woman', 'who', 'vampire', 'much', 'more', 'meaningful', 'original', 'Let', 'Me', 'quickly', 'killed', 'off', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'becoming', 'eventual', 'suggested', 'suicide', 'scene', 'where', 'attacked', 'cats', 'original', 'never', 'made', 'Let', 'Me', 'scene', 'was', 'fantastic', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'original', 'plot', 'line', 'did', 'help', 'portray', 'what', 'when', 'one', 'vampire', 'so', 'aspect', 'removing', 'story', 'Let', 'Me', 'detracts', 'being', 'pure', 'vampire', 'movie', 'everyone', 'original', 'much', 'better', 'Let', 'Me', 'In.I', 'honestly', 'movies', 'same', 'very', 'different', 'reasons', ""'re"", 'keepers', 'amazing', 'remake', 'so', 'recently', 'done', 'original', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'successful']",N/A
1339945,ATP9LYGM6D3RO,B003EYVXUU,"McGillicutty ""DVD Fan""","[1, 2]","*SPOILER ALERT*Before you read this review,I have included a few items about the plot of the film.Put simply, ""Let Me In"" is a nearly shot-for-shot remake of ""Let the Right One In"", but it lacks much of what made the original work so well. Even on its own, ""Let Me In"" suffers from lack of character focus, story construction and has too many contradictions to successfully suspend disbelief. While I understand that some consider it as good, if not better than the original, I have my reasons for not sharing that opinion.Let me say first what I found enjoyable about ""Let Me In"". I thought that the pacing was quite good, perhaps even better than the original in terms of moving along the action. And, the ""car rollover"" scene is also one of the best, most memorable effects I have seen in quite a while. It would be interesting to see a video of how they staged and executed that particular shot which was all from inside the vehicle.And that's about all I enjoyed in ""Let Me In"".On the negative side, while ""Let the Right One In"" is about two characters in search of meaning for their lives, ""Let Me In"" is about a rather inept vampire seeking a replacement for her older, clumsy caretaker so she won't have to do the dirty work of killing the victims herself. It's a far less interesting premise that was boxed into virtually the same story format as the original. It was almost as if director Matt Reeves had built his storyboards around each scene in ""Let the Right One In"" and wrote a different story in its place. The result is a film that merely hints at the power of the original novel and first film while falling into many of the old, tired cliches that could have been easily avoided.""Let Me In"" is not well photographed and uses dark, dingy tones that obscures much of the action of the night scenes. The climactic scene at the pool (an absolute classic in the original) is so dark and confusingly shot that its difficult to discern what is really happening. If you do a shot-for-shot comparison to the original film, in many scenes the actors are positioned or ""blocked"" on the opposite side in ""Let Me In"" which I found somewhat humorous actually. I guess this is not a criticism, but more of an observation about how much seems copied from the first film in terms of how the actors are positioned.Kodi Smit-McPhee (Owen) and Chloe Grace Moretz (Abby) may be fine actors in their own right, but I saw absolutely no chemistry between them at all. Furthermore, Chloe's speech pattern of soft, unemotional whispers dilutes her character to the point of being rather uninteresting. She conveys none of the wisdom or even world wariness of being a centuries-old vampire.Perhaps my issues with ""Let Me In"" could be summed up by the ""Cop"" character played by Elias Koteas. Apparently, and this is not made very clear, Elias is on the trail of what he thinks is a ""Satanic cult"" which I assume are Abby and her Caretaker (Richard Jenkins) going from town to town killing people. When Elias knocks on the door to Abby's apartment for the second time in the film, he suspects that whoever is inside MIGHT (operative word: MIGHT) know something about the killings. He hears the floorboard gently squeak from inside the apartment, so he draws his gun and KICKS in the door, breaking and entering for NO reason at all. Why would he do such a thing instead of calling for backup and keeping the apartment under surveillance until getting a warrant? Well, because the script told him to enter and *SPOILER ALERT* get killed, that's why. It makes no sense, but there it is.""Let Me In"" just doesn't work and pales considerably when compared to the original. But even if I hadn't seen the original first, it would have been pretty difficult for me to find much to like about this movie. A shame really since another interpretation of the original novel would have made ""Let Me In"" a worthwhile effort. But instead, it is but a pale, albeit dark and dingy shadow of the original film with nothing new to add.",2,"Why Does ""Let Me In"" Fail to Shine?

The original film, Let the Right One In, was an adaptation of a book that had complicated, uncomfortable themes that made it a challenge to adapt to the big screen.  This gave the Swedish film some rough edges: a prelude to a retrospective montage that never happened, Eli's androgyny, and the potentially unpleasant relationship between Eli and her ""ghoul"" (to use a Vampire RPG term).The androgynous nature of Eli changes her interactions with Oskar.  The mysterious relationship between Eli and her guardian let the viewer come to his or her own conclusions. Although Let the Right One In wasn't perfect, its flaws made it a better film. Let Me In smoothes over all these rough edges, for better or worse.The beautiful and deadly Chloe Grace Moretz (excellent as Hit Girl in Kick-Ass and equally breathtaking here) is Abby, an unearthly little girl who doesn't seem bothered by the cold, loves puzzles, and whose appearance veers from pretty to bedraggled. She befriends outcast Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee, just as vulnerable here as he was in The Road), who dreams of stabbing the bullies who harass him.The subtle but important difference between the two films pivots on what the bullies call Owen (Oskar in the original): ""little pig."" In the American version, Owen is called a little girl.  The gender appellation shifts the movie's focus from two lonely souls finding each other across the gulf of death to two Romeo and Juliet-style prepubescent tweens discovering romance. This doesn't lessen the emotional impact of Let the Right One, but it does change the film's tone significantly.With the exception of the cat sequence, which is missing entirely from Let Me In, Let the Right One In has creepier special effects.  Whether it's Eli/Abby's eyes flashing like a cat, the wreck of Hakan/Thomas' (Richard Jenkins) acid-ravaged face, or Virginia's (Sasha Barrese) horrible conflagration, Let Me In's digital effects look subpar in comparison. For some reason, all of Abby's attacks are handled digitally, which makes them surreal.Even the ending, which is almost a frame-for-frame reproduction, lacks the gut punch of the original by ratcheting back the gore. Let Me In fixes many discrepancies in Let the Right One In, but in doing so seems to be embarrassed by its Swedish roots.  But if you've never seen the original, Let Me In is an excellent substitute.",3,A question of gender,1313798400,"08 20, 2011",2011,2456,"['Seeing', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'two', 'weeks', 'Let', 'Me', 'interesting', 'comparison', 'original', 'film', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'was', 'adaptation', 'book', 'had', 'complicated', 'uncomfortable', 'themes', 'made', 'challenge', 'adapt', 'big', 'screen', 'gave', 'Swedish', 'film', 'rough', 'edges', 'prelude', 'retrospective', 'montage', 'never', 'happened', 'Eli', 'androgyny', 'potentially', 'unpleasant', 'relationship', 'Eli', 'ghoul', 'use', 'Vampire', 'RPG', 'term', '.The', 'androgynous', 'nature', 'Eli', 'changes', 'interactions', 'Oskar', 'mysterious', 'relationship', 'Eli', 'guardian', 'let', 'viewer', 'come', 'own', 'conclusions', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'flaws', 'made', 'better', 'film', 'Let', 'Me', 'smoothes', 'rough', 'edges', 'better', 'worse.The', 'beautiful', 'deadly', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'excellent', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'Kick-Ass', 'equally', 'breathtaking', 'here', 'Abby', 'unearthly', 'little', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bothered', 'cold', 'puzzles', 'appearance', 'veers', 'pretty', 'bedraggled', 'outcast', 'Owen', 'Kodi', 'Smit-McPhee', 'just', 'vulnerable', 'here', 'was', 'Road', 'who', 'stabbing', 'bullies', 'who', 'harass', 'him.The', 'subtle', 'important', 'difference', 'two', 'films', 'pivots', 'what', 'bullies', 'call', 'Owen', 'Oskar', 'original', 'little', 'pig', 'American', 'version', 'Owen', 'called', 'little', 'girl', 'gender', 'appellation', 'shifts', 'movie', 'focus', 'two', 'lonely', 'souls', 'finding', 'other', 'gulf', 'death', 'two', 'Romeo', 'Juliet-style', 'prepubescent', 'tweens', 'discovering', 'romance', ""n't"", 'lessen', 'emotional', 'impact', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'change', 'film', 'tone', 'significantly.With', 'exception', 'cat', 'sequence', 'missing', 'entirely', 'Let', 'Me', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'creepier', 'special', 'effects', 'Eli/Abby', 'eyes', 'flashing', 'cat', 'wreck', 'Hakan/Thomas', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'acid-ravaged', 'face', 'Virginia', 'Sasha', 'Barrese', 'horrible', 'conflagration', 'Let', 'Me', 'digital', 'effects', 'look', 'subpar', 'comparison', 'reason', 'Abby', 'attacks', 'are', 'handled', 'digitally', 'surreal.Even', 'ending', 'almost', 'frame-for-frame', 'reproduction', 'gut', 'punch', 'original', 'ratcheting', 'back', 'gore', 'Let', 'Me', 'fixes', 'many', 'discrepancies', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'doing', 'so', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'Swedish', 'roots', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'Let', 'Me', 'excellent', 'substitute']",N/A

It stars that foul mouthed girl from Kickass and she's a vampire stuck in a 12 year olds body. Low and behold she falls for the 12 year old boy next door. Only the boy doesn't know she is a blood thirsty creature of the night. All she mainly does is give the kid next door a new friend and helps him grow confidence in himself. Other than that it's a pretty drawn out film with no pace, and very stale for the most part. I guess if you can't get enough of the atmosphere and tone of movies like The Sixth Sense, then this movie is the perfect fit next to it on the video shelf. However to me, after hearing this won so many awards for it's genre, and praised so much for being better than it's original European version, it made me wonder whom gives those awards? As, this film, it's not horror. Is it a thriller? Not really. Is it a comedy? Definitely not. So what is it? It's drama. It's just plain and simple drama with a little bit of supernatural element thrown into it.I can see now why it won so many awards, because it was given those awards by those not truly horror fans and enjoyed this simply because it did not scare them and they have based praising the film on other things besides what it was billed as. Look, I don't mind these kind of movies, but if you are going to say a movie is the #1 horror film of the year, award it to a movie that is actually a horror film, and not one that has a small handful of tiny horror moments thrown into what is otherwise a rather boring love story.The story itself is not much either, what you expect will happen, happens. And what you predict will happen in the end, happens just that way. There is no twists and turns, and there is certainly no mystery to anything. Worst of all, no surprises. So with all that mentioned, how on Earth is this really considered to be the best horror film of 2013? How was any of it the best of any category other than best drama by adolescents? I can see why people enjoy the movie, but really, shouldn't the best of the best be one you aren't falling asleep to most of the time, come away with memories and perhaps quotes, and then want to watch it a second time, third time, fourth etc .... ???",2,2 and a half stars.,1403395200,"06 22, 2014",2014,2336,"['Ok', 'get', 'remake', 'Euro', 'film', 'people', 'are', 'praising', 'being', 'better', 'original', 'really', 'make', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'girl', 'Kickass', 'vampire', 'stuck', '12', 'year', 'olds', 'body', 'Low', 'behold', '12', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'Only', 'boy', ""n't"", 'know', 'blood', 'thirsty', 'creature', 'night', 'mainly', 'give', 'kid', 'next', 'door', 'new', 'friend', 'grow', 'confidence', 'Other', 'pretty', 'drawn', 'out', 'film', 'pace', 'very', 'stale', 'most', 'part', 'guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'atmosphere', 'tone', 'movies', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'then', 'movie', 'perfect', 'fit', 'next', 'video', 'shelf', 'However', 'hearing', 'won', 'so', 'many', 'awards', 'genre', 'praised', 'so', 'much', 'being', 'better', 'original', 'European', 'version', 'made', 'wonder', 'whom', 'awards', 'film', 'not', 'horror', 'thriller', 'Not', 'really', 'comedy', 'Definitely', 'not', 'So', 'what', 'drama', 'just', 'plain', 'simple', 'drama', 'little', 'bit', 'supernatural', 'element', 'thrown', 'it.I', 'can', 'see', 'now', 'why', 'won', 'so', 'many', 'awards', 'was', 'given', 'awards', 'not', 'truly', 'horror', 'fans', 'enjoyed', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'scare', 'have', 'based', 'praising', 'film', 'other', 'things', 'what', 'was', 'billed', 'Look', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'kind', 'movies', 'are', 'going', 'say', 'movie', '1', 'horror', 'film', 'year', 'movie', 'actually', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'small', 'handful', 'tiny', 'horror', 'moments', 'thrown', 'what', 'otherwise', 'rather', 'boring', 'love', 'story.The', 'story', 'not', 'much', 'what', 'expect', 'will', 'happen', 'what', 'predict', 'will', 'happen', 'end', 'just', 'way', 'twists', 'turns', 'certainly', 'no', 'mystery', 'anything', 'Worst', 'surprises', 'So', 'mentioned', 'how', 'Earth', 'really', 'considered', 'be', 'best', 'horror', 'film', '2013', 'How', 'was', 'best', 'category', 'other', 'best', 'drama', 'adolescents', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'best', 'best', 'be', 'one', 'are', ""n't"", 'falling', 'asleep', 'most', 'time', 'come', 'away', 'memories', 'perhaps', 'quotes', 'then', 'want', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'third', 'time', 'fourth', 'etc']",N/A

El-Hewie""","[7, 13]","The blood sucking and vampire aspects of the movie blended well with the loneliness and helplessness of a young child. You would walk out of the movie believing that the helpless child viewed impoverished and strange people as vampires and benefited from their greater suffering in alleviating his.The mother of the child remained anonymous and faceless. The father remained remote and disinterested. Thus, the lone child has to face life by making his own image of what life should be. His neighbors are isolated and remote. His only encounter was a girl who has no traceable past, does not know her real age, never went to school, poor, and expresses strange senses of never feeling cold. In the school, the lone child is bullied by ruthless kids and could not gather his strength to ward off aggression.The movie then shows multiple murders by the father of the neighbor and impoverished girl. It was not clear whether those murders were mere speculation by the lone child after he grew up or were mere guessing to frame the strange and secretive neighbor.""Let me in"" sounded mutual. The lone boy needed someone to talk to and share. The strange and impoverished neighbor has something to offer. She advised the feeble and defenseless boy to fight back when others bully him. Thus, the two kids could share, one was desperate for friendship, the other for normality. The strange neighbor girl sounded as an extraterrestrial creature within the norms of the lone boy. His mind perceived her as the savior vampire who could help him fight back the aggressors. The perceived vampire permeated into the mind of the lone boy as the savior in moments of extreme fear. She sucked the blood of others, climbed trees and buildings faster than chimpanzees, but harbored love and friendship towards him.How such scenario related to the the year 1982, New Mexico, or to Ronald Reagan's presidency, is obscure to me.",4,Created a new friendly rule for a vampire.,1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,1906,"['blood', 'sucking', 'vampire', 'aspects', 'movie', 'blended', 'well', 'loneliness', 'helplessness', 'young', 'child', 'would', 'walk', 'movie', 'believing', 'helpless', 'child', 'viewed', 'impoverished', 'strange', 'people', 'vampires', 'benefited', 'greater', 'suffering', 'alleviating', 'his.The', 'mother', 'child', 'remained', 'anonymous', 'faceless', 'father', 'remained', 'remote', 'disinterested', 'Thus', 'lone', 'child', 'face', 'life', 'making', 'own', 'image', 'what', 'life', 'should', 'be', 'neighbors', 'are', 'isolated', 'remote', 'only', 'encounter', 'was', 'girl', 'who', 'traceable', 'past', 'not', 'know', 'real', 'age', 'never', 'went', 'school', 'poor', 'strange', 'senses', 'never', 'feeling', 'cold', 'school', 'lone', 'child', 'bullied', 'ruthless', 'kids', 'could', 'not', 'gather', 'strength', 'ward', 'off', 'aggression.The', 'movie', 'then', 'multiple', 'murders', 'father', 'neighbor', 'impoverished', 'girl', 'was', 'not', 'clear', 'murders', 'were', 'mere', 'speculation', 'lone', 'child', 'grew', 'up', 'were', 'mere', 'guessing', 'frame', 'strange', 'secretive', 'neighbor', 'Let', 'sounded', 'mutual', 'lone', 'boy', 'needed', 'someone', 'talk', 'share', 'strange', 'impoverished', 'neighbor', 'something', 'offer', 'advised', 'feeble', 'defenseless', 'boy', 'fight', 'back', 'when', 'others', 'bully', 'Thus', 'two', 'kids', 'could', 'share', 'one', 'was', 'desperate', 'friendship', 'other', 'normality', 'strange', 'neighbor', 'girl', 'sounded', 'extraterrestrial', 'creature', 'norms', 'lone', 'boy', 'mind', 'perceived', 'savior', 'vampire', 'who', 'could', 'help', 'fight', 'back', 'aggressors', 'perceived', 'vampire', 'permeated', 'mind', 'lone', 'boy', 'savior', 'moments', 'extreme', 'fear', 'sucked', 'blood', 'others', 'climbed', 'trees', 'buildings', 'faster', 'chimpanzees', 'harbored', 'love', 'friendship', 'towards', 'him.How', 'such', 'scenario', 'related', 'year', '1982', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'presidency', 'obscure']",N/A

Oleson,"[4, 4]","This is one of those rare Hollywood remakes of a good Euro film - in this case the Swedish ""Let the Right One In"" - that is actually better than the original.  While I liked the original 2008 film, I thought it left too many questions unanswered which drew away attention from the main story.  This includes the controversial vampire he-or-she question.  More on that later.  This film which was brilliantly directed and written by ""Cloverfield's"" Matt Reeves, smartly avoids the question for the most part.The best thing about this sweet, tender, violent, bloody movie is the 2 young leads.  Both should go far and I expect Chloe Moretz will break a few hearts along the way.  The film does closely follow the predecessor and even repeats some dialog word for word.  Transplanted to remote Los Alamos, New Mexico, the film works on every level.  At times you forget you are watching a ""vampire movie"", but instead watching a budding young love relationship.  Don't get too comfortable however, there's enough blood to go around.Finally, this question from the original movie of whether Abby (this movie) ne Eli (Swedish) is a boy or girl.  This film wisely removes the question.  The original leaves it open for discussion.  My research comes up with numerous theories, none of which made much sense to me.  Since this is an adaptation from a book, I checked it out.  In the book, the author says Eli is an androgynous boy from centuries ago castrated by a sadistic vampire nobleman.

The dark script and characters are still fantastic this time around, but it's almost an exact copy of the one that came before. The last horror film I remember that followed almost scene for scene from the source material was Psycho, and we all know how that turned out. At first I was trying to think of a reason why they would remake an already good/great movie so soon, but I guess they thought most audiences in the U.S. wouldn't want to read the subtitles that the foreign version had to offer.The story involves a 12-year-old vampire girl who befriends a neighbor boy, while her loving ""father"" has to kill people and bring home blood for her survival.Chloe Moretz is even more impressive here than in her breakout role as Hit-Girl in Kick-Ass. There is just something hypnotic about her acting. When she is on screen, your eyes are transfixed. I can see a Jodie Foster like career for her, if she doesn't go the Lohan way. Kodi Smit-McPhee was up to the challenge as well. They share some great chemistry. You rarely see one good child actor performance in a movie, let alone two. Richard Jenkins didn't have a major role as the father figure of the vampire girl, but he fit the mold nicely.I liked the atmosphere and creepy visuals even more in this version. The kills were also more quick, brutal and bloody. Some people seem to be complaining about the CGI (which isn't used much anyway), like when the vampire climbs up a tree, but I hardly noticed. The music was okay, but could have been more memorable. I liked the way Blue Oyster Cult's ""Burnin' For You"" and The Greg Kihn Band's ""The Breakup Song"" were put to use.Let Me In is easily one of the top five films I've seen this year. I think you will enjoy it more if you don't see the original first, but they are both equally great (maybe a slight edge to this one, especially if you don't want to read), so I'll let you decide.

Movies like this tend to falter if the script is terrible, even if there's a good cast. Fortunately, Let Me In has a good script and the whole movie is a real treat from start to finish.The film is really powered by Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee. The two young actors are given a big task of essentially carrying the film. The maturity level of the two of them is incredible and they handle some pretty dark stuff in this movie.There haven't been many horror movies as riveting as Let Me In recently. It might be a remake of the Swedish film, but it has plenty of character in its own right. After seeing the original, I was amazed at how Let Me In paid homage to the book and the film while maintaining a level of originality in its own right.

'Let Me In' is almost a shot-for-shot remake of 'Let the Right One In', the Swedish vampire film by director Tomas Alfredson. There are scripting changes that appears to have been done to tailor the script to American audiences. Some are understandable, others are not. For example, the original is set in a Swedish community that was built in the age of Swedish socialism and this setting is part of the film's backstory which is set in the cold winter of 1982. The American version changes this to an apartment complex during a cold snowy winter in ....  1980's Arizona(?). The impact of the setting laid out in the original is lost in the remake. In the original, Oscar's mother is obviously not religious; in the remake Owen's mother (name change here) is clearly very religious for no apparent reason.The original film has a particularly Swedish approach to storytelling which is one of things that makes it such an interesting film for film fans who like to understand a director's style.Much has been made about the use of CGI in this film. The remake has too obviously inserted CGI in 2 critical scenes. They are fake looking, obviously CGI,  and are out of place in a film that was produced to have a realistic film approach.The remake IS a good film and a welcomed relief for what passes as a horror film nowadays, and normally would deserve a higher rating then 3 stars. But since I rate the original a 4-star film, and the remake is not quite the film that the original is, this version need a lesser rating.  The director also makes, in my opinion, a mistake in his commentary in not acknowledging that his film is a direct remake of the original.

There are some spoilers, so if you haven't seen the film yet, I suggest you quit reading this essay at once.My intentions where to write something in the style of my all time favorite film commentary track, which exists in The Criterion addition of The Sam Pekinpah film Straw Dogs 1971. A scholar named Stephen Prince who specializes in violence in film gives what is in essence a master class on the subject while pointing out thousands of little subtleties playing beneath the narrative, the effect is simply brilliant. I feel that my film watching strengths also lie in observing such subtleties, and Let Me In is chock-full of them. The reason is that director Matt Reeves does not insult the intelligence of the viewer by trying to explain every little thing to them. At the same time he uses visual and character behavior to tell the story. This makes Let Me In a joy for the sophisticated movie watcher. For those of you who feel that my essay is self indulgent, I must remind you that self indulgence is simply self expression, and all I am really doing is working on sharpening my writing skills. I had submitted this review about three weeks ago without this introduction, but I noticed that some people didn't really understand what I was actually intending. I also removed two paragraphs that in hind sight where kind of like boulders in the flow of the stream. One was about the camera work in the scenes of violence, the other was about what a great expressive face Kodi Smit-McPhee has. Hopefully people will find this version of the film essay to be a bit easier to read. Regardless of how this is accepted, at least I will always know that I am proud of it. In the end that is what really matters, but I still secretly hope some of you enjoy this film essay anyway. Thank you.Virginal Footprints in the snow,Left there by a mysterious vision.Came out of that black shape,Like a black cape,In answer to my invitation...He might as well be on the moon.The main character in Let Me In is a 12 year old by named Owen who lives alone with his mother in a low rent apartment complex. Since Owen is only a child, he lacks the developed ability to express the many levels of suffering and confusion he is currently feeling. Like Owen, the film hides most of its meaning beneath its narrative, suggesting many dark ideas without ever explaining any of them to the audience. Owen is a frail middle school student without a single friend in the world. He is a timid boy that is being systematically bullied by the toughest guys in his grade. Owen is often shown wearing this puffy metallic silver jacket that gives him the look of an astonaut, while in his bedroom, an entire wall is given over to a giant mural of the lunar surface. The implication is obvious, Owen might as well be on the moon himself. Even God and country have turned their backs on Owen. There is a rather subversive use of a Ronald Reagan speech in the opening section of the film in which the president is glorifying the supposed righteousness of all Americans simply for being born an American. This fallacy is echoed a few scenes later when Owen is shown reciting The Pledge of Allegiance in class. While the entire class is saying 'One nation under God' in unison, Owen is struck on the right arm by a giant spit ball right on th word 'God'. In a later scene, Owen tells his mother that he cut his face during a fall in the school playground, when in reality the alpha male bully Ken had whipped Owen across the cheek with a broken off radio antenna. Rather then do the parental work necessary to fully uncover the reality of her sons painful situation, his mother just tells Owen to be more careful next time and then immediately launches into the dinner prayer. In Owen's bleak world, God and country have become perverted insults that only further alienate him. Even when we do see his mother up close her face is all out of focus, the rest of the time she is always shown from a distance. This visual depiction matches her near nonexistent parenting. Even Owen's father is nothing more then a voice on the other end of the phone that fails miserably to listen to what Owen is so desperately trying to tell him. Though none of these institutional and parental failing are ever being discussed anywhere in the dialogue itself, the audience still picks up on them through these various clues. The sad truth that is being revealed to us shows that like every other institution in Owen's life, his parents have done nothing for him at all, except to continually let him down.Owen with Abby colored eyes.Despite his ineffectuality, Owen has still managed to get himself into some disturbingly unsavory activities. In an act of transference Owen is shown bullying his own reflection at knife point in his bedroom mirror while wearing a clear plastic old man mask. It is a wonderfully ambiguous visual choice that suggest a number of intriguing possibilities. By wearing this mask over his face, is Owen being something that he is not, or is he being something that he might become in the future? This moment is immediately fallowed by the creepy business of spying on his various neighbors with his bedroom telescope. Since Owen is both interested and overwhelmed by the mysteries of sex, he quickly focuses his spying upon his sultry neighbor Virginia who is in the very beginning of make up sex with her boyfriend. Virginia is a strikingly beautiful woman in her mid 20's and is clearly the object of most of Owen's sexual fantasies. These various elements are laid bare without any narrative explanation, but beyond this, an even more curios visual effect takes place. The light shining back into Owen's eyes through the elongated telescope almost matches Abby's ghastly white vampire irises when she is in the throws of a feeding frenzy. This is a most ingenious visual cue, because it is at this point that Abby makes her first appearance in the film. From his bedroom window, Owen watches Abby get out of the passanger side of a moving van, at first she appears to be nothing more then a black silhouette. Then from out of this darkness emerges this cloaked angelic figure who proceeds to lead the way through the snow in her bare feet, looking for all the world like a homeless squatter. She is being fallowed by a 60 year old man who is struggling mightily with an oversized trunk held awkwardly in both arms. Through Owen's eyes we see much that is not revealed within the narrative itself, the most striking of which is that this barefooted child vagabond appears to be in charge of the old man.Abby, the enternal adolescent.It becomes clear when you watch the interaction between Abby and the 60 year old man, that the old man is still very much in love with her. He hates to disappoint Abby and is clearly jealous of her seeing 'that boy'. Abby and this old man have been a couple for a very long time, and their scenes together eerily answer the eternal quesion of how long Abby remains passionate with her human provider. Though their current situation seems to be that of a passive aggressive marriage rather then a fervid love affair, one gets the feeling that they have remained actively affectionate with one another a lot longer then one would care to think. What is clear is that Abby no longer seems physically attracted to her current boyfriend.Just how long Abby has been a vampire is never really answered in the film, but we do know that she has been with the old man since he was a preteen himself, which is close to 50 years. Yet despite being possibly houndreds of years old, Abby still acts like a 12 year old kid, for one thing, she seems either unable or unwilling to provide for herself independently. This would all be fine if it wasn't for the fact that people keep dying around Abby at such an alarming rate. From the clues I gathered from watching both versions of this story, I have come to the conclusion that on average 10 people have to die each month for Abby to live. It is also clear that it is her human provider who has to do all of the dirty work for her. This means that in all the years he has been with Abby, the old man has had to either kill or dispose of the bodies of roughly 6000 people.Richard Jenkins who plays the old man in Let Me In is the person who came up with the idea of wearing a dark colored plastic trash bag over his head with cut out eye slits when he captures his victims. The visual effect is as horrifying as it is wickedly subversive. Whether aware of it or not, Richard Jenkins had made this character look exactly like a KKK member, only with an opposing color for the hood. The subversion digs even deeper in that Richard Jenkins is only shown killing white people in this film. Even his method of killing matches a KKK lynching exactly, except that much like the opposing color of his hood, his victims are strung up to a tree upside down by their ankles rather then right side up by their necks. From here he sets a large plastic jug with a funnel in its top underneath his strung up victim and then cuts their jugular to drain their life blood into this crude take home receptacle.Seeing a Rubix Cube become the catalyst of Abby and Owen's courtship was a deeply satisfying moment for me, because I am someone who is able to solve the cube in under three mintues. It is in this scene that Abby decides to pursue Owen, yet even this apparent innocent budding romance can be looked at in a more sinister level. Abby just had a nasty fight with the old man who had returned home with an appetizer rather then a meal. During the arguement, the old man tells Abby that he has grown tired of killing and might be getting sloppy on purpose in order to get caught. This leaves the door wide open for debate as to whether Abby has really fallen in love with Owen, or whether this is just a set of calculated moves to manipulate Owen into thaking the old mans place on 'the day shift'.Leopards can not change their spots.If Owen's beautiful neighbor Virginia is his sex siren, then Abby is Owen's otherworldly virginal Goddess. Abby represents everything that is meaningful, eternal, nurturing, and magical in Owen's deficient existence. The contrast between these two feminine influences in Owen's life is greater emphasized by constantly showing Virginia in an ornamental subservient roll to her rugged boyfriend Larry. Not for one second do we ever see Abby in a subservient roll to anyone in this film. There is something ultimately twisted about Abby's attack on Virginia. Virginia is after all the object of Owen's lust. It is not just that The Madonna is killing The Whore in this scene, it is that Owen's Madonna is killing Owen's Whore. It only took being in close proximity of a few drops of Owen's blood for Abby to attack Virginia in such a state of uncontrollable animalistic bloodlust, that it makes her vampirism seem like some kind of unstoppable hormonal reaction to puberty. Like everything else in this film, the visceral nature of Virginia's attack also effects the viewer on a subconscious level due to its underlying symbolism. Abby leaps on Virginia from the top of a tree, and then bites into her throat immediately. This is the exact same method that a leopard utilizes when attacking an antelope in the wild. Virginia is also wearing a fur coat at the time of the attack which further depicts her as being a jungle cats prey. These visual choices makes the attack look just like something one would see on Wild Kingdom.When Abby talks to Owen, her words carry the same kind of symbolic connotations. Everything Abby says can be taken as literal prophetic truth. When they first meet, Owen points at his bedroom window and nervously tells Abby where he lives. You can clearly see all the flustered emotion on his face. Owen is so instantaneously attracted to this mysterious cloaked little girl that he nearly falls apart in her presence. Instead of reciprocating his longing, Abby tells Owen that she can not be his friend. This is actually a much truer statement then we could have ever realized. When she tells Owen that if it comes down to it she will help him fight the bullies, she backs this statement up with all the force of an army. What this implies about her constant insistence to Owen that 'she is not a girl' and is in fact 'nothing', staggers the imagination. Was she making these statements simply because she is a vampire, or is she in fact implying that she has no sexual organs at all? If there is one thing we do know for sure about Abby, when she says something she generally more then means it.Home is where you're currently living at the time.There is a curios line of dialogue that forced me to examine whether it was a cinematic flaw that went unnoticed by the director. After Abby scales the outside of the hospital building, she taps on the window and asks her human provider if she can enter his hospital room. The old man is unable to speak due to the self inflicted acid burns on his face, so Abby has to remain outside in the cold. There is a scene a little later in this movie in which Abby proves her devotion to Owen by showing him what will happen to her if she enters his home uninvited. The scene sets a clear timeline for how long it takes for Abby to reveal her vampire nature involuntarily to an outsider. Within just 15 seconds, Abby begins to shake uncontrollably, then by half a minute blood starts to gush from all parts of her body at once. Owen ultimately proves his love for Abby by frantically granting her permission to be in his house. Owen then runs over and cradles Abby in his arms and asks if she would of died had he not of said anything. She replies.""I knew you wouldn't let me.""Though this scene is remarkable for managing to be both moving and alarming at the same time, the problem with it is, is that we see Abby enter four other buildings uninvited. One location was the front reception desk of the hospital, another was a convenience store, then there was the apartment complex recreation room, and finally the indoor pool at the middle school in which she entered through the skylight to save Owen during the films climax. This paradox is one I am willing to concede with the simple excuse of 'home is where you are currently living at the time'. By being hospitalized in intensive care, that hospital room had become the surrogate home for the old man. Abby was now unable to enter this 'living space' without his permission.Another potential problem was Owen's discovery of the photo booth pictures that showed Abby and the old man when he was a 12 year old boy himself. Since the events depicted in this film are shown to be taking place in 1983, this would mean that those photo booth pictures where taken some time in the mid 1930's. The question is, did photo booths even exist in 1935? What I found was that the photo booth was invented in 1889 by a man named Matthew Stiffens, and where later mass produced throughout America on March 27th 1927 by The Photomation Company. The discovery of the photo booth pictures not only checks out, but is astoundingly accurate. Due to the relative freshness of this national phenomena, taking a phto booth picture would have been a very popular thing to do in 1935.If there is one clear error in the film that I am not willing to concede for any reason, it's the lack of proper police procedure demonstrated by the police sergeant. He had been finding bloodless bodies for several weeks, and had even witnessed Virginia burst into flames in her hospital bed when she was hit by the morning sunlight. Even his one and only suspect had fallen ten floors to his death after mysteriously being drained of blood himself. About the only clue he had left to go on was that a 12 year old girl was somehow tied to all this murder and death. The problem occurs when he hears the floorboards creak from inside of Abby's apartment. He quickly draws his fire arm, yells police, kicks down the door, stalks through the house for a good three minutes finding evidence of the murder victims, before eventually finding Abby sleeping in the bottom of the bath tub. Yet in all this time, he never does the one thing that any real cop would have done first thing before doing anything else...Call for back up. I really wish that the film would of shown the sergeant lose or break his police radio during the raid to fix this one trouble spot in the film, because the rest of the movie is damn near perfect.Evil needs love too.Once Abby decides to pursue Owen you will notice that she never takes her eyes off of him, unless it's to coyly look down in alluring shyness when the conversation borders on what makes her tick. In their very first scene together the audience becomes fully invested in seeing them end up as a couple. Yet as captivatingly beautiful as their romance is, Owen is eventually going to have to provide blood for Abby, and we already know what that entails. It is equally disturbing that she enters Owen's bedroom window like a succubus mere moments after she drained the blood out of her last long term partner. How subversive is it that thier bedroom conversation seems so tender and innocent when considering all the other implications? Out of the two movies, I definitely prefer how this moment was covered in Let The Right One In. I really miss the 'Bulleri bulleri bock' Swedish children's guessing game thing in which Eli has Oskar guess how many fingers she is tapping him with. I also wish that Abby would of caressed Owen's shoulder and arm the way that Eli caressed Oskar's in Let The Right One In. I find it weak that Owen was wearing a shirt in this scene, unlike Oskar who was shirtless and quit possibly naked. There is something ultimately dementedly satisfying about watching Eli indulge herself on touching the silky skin of her prey. The consolation for me is that there are two fantastic versions of the same tale, and I just happen to be wise enough to love both of them equally for the different strengths that they bring to the table.Even though the viewer can interpret the subtleties in this film many different ways, I still believe that Abby has ultimately fallen in love with Owen. Why else would she have offered to eat his human candy when she knew it would make her choke? There is a real attraction that Abby feels for Owen that goes far beyond necessity. However, it is still so disastrously sad that Abby isn't going to turn Owen into a vampire and stay with him forever. The real tragedy of this story is that Owen  is going to grow old on Abby and eventually outlive his usefulness. Maybe that is how her evil really works. For unlike Owen's parents, school, God, or country, Abby is never going to let Owen down. This is the whole essence of the story. For once in his miserable little life, someone is actaully willing to do what ever it takes to make him feel like he actually matters. Unfortunately for Owen, that someone just happens to be a living dead monster. But in the end, who could really blame Owen for loving Abby? When you really consider the amazing way in which she rescues him at the end of the film, there really is no Earthly reason for him to look back at all. As for Abby, who could blame her for loving Owen?...After all, romance is for the young, and evil needs love too.",5,Romance is for the young.,1298937600,"03 1, 2011",2011,19423,"['Introduction',

1339974,AWOROFNE3S4W3,B003EYVXUU,Phillip Frangules,"[3, 8]","When Let Me In was announced, there was backlash from fans of the original Swedish film Let the Right One In, given that the original film had just came out. It's par for the course for a foreign film to be remade so soon after its release nowadays, but director /writer Matt Reeves assured them that this would not be a typical remake. Instead, he promised that this would be a different take on the original novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist.  He had also told Lindqvist in a private conversation that he had no intention of copying the Swedish film but had fallen in love with the novel and wanted to use that. Given that the novel is significantly different from the original film, there was plenty of new material that Reeves could have chose from. For example, the character of Hakan in the novel is considerably more disturbing than anything the Swedish film showed.While I can't say if Reeves' film changed since he made those original comments, anyone familiar with both the novel and the Swedish film will know that this film is very much a straight up remake of the film. It follows the Swedish screenplay beat for beat, right down to elements in the Swedish film that weren't even in the original novel. There are some differences (a car crash sequence being the biggest one) but for the most part this is Tomas Alfredson's original film with minor cosmetic changes. Given how great the novel is, it's a shame that Reeves took the easy way out as opposed to looking at the original source material with fresh eyes and giving us something different. Maybe a more faithful adaptation would still have been weaker, but at least Reeves could say with honesty that he put his own stamp on the story as opposed to copying what had gone on before him.The film itself pretty much follows the criteria that most American remakes of foreign horror films follow nowadays (and yes, I know that it's from a British studio). I'll give Reeves credit for not making the kids high schoolers and for trying to make a  horror film for adults, but at the same time, any serious director must know that making this Twilight would be tantamount to shooting yourself in the head. So let's check go through the checklist:1. More violence and gore? Check. Most of the violence in the original film was restrained, here everything is cranked up to eleven. At times it's almost ridiculous. I could list numerous examples but I'd end up recapping the whole film, so one will stand for all: the finale. The original's finale is almost beautiful despite its horrific content; here, everything is loud, messy and chaotic and wouldn't seem out of place in any other horror film.2. Simplified plot? Check. Reeves does away with most of the supporting cast and subplots in the Swedish film. For some viewers, this has been a positive, but I felt it took away from the depth of the story. In the original film, much of the victims came across as real people and made the film more tragic. Here, they're walking blood bags and little else.3. Less ambiguity? Check. There's a lot of mystery in the Swedish film. You were left to draw your own conclusions. Here, Reeves spells everything out for the audience. The funny thing is, the original film really isn't that hard to follow or understand, so all the 'explaining' comes off as a lack of respect for the audience's intelligence. It's not as if the Swedish film was Synecdoche, New York.4. Cleaning up 'objectionable' content? Check. This is hard to explain without spoiling it, but if you've seen the Swedish film you know what I'm talking about. There's a disturbing scene that puts the entire film into a different perspective, and deals with a theme that many are uncomfortable with. Predictably (seriously, did anyone think that was going to be in this?), it's been removed.All in all, I really can't recommend this. At best, the film is competently made and has some decent performances. But if you've seen the Swedish film, this really doesn't offer anything different or worthwhile. It's more or less the same film, just simplified, 'cleaned up' and made gorier for mainstream audiences. If you haven't seen the Swedish film, then drop what you are doing and watch that now. If you don't want to watch the Swedish film because it's subtitled, then I'm sorry that you're missing out one of many great films from around the world.",2,What you would expect from an American remake of a foreign horror film,1311465600,"07 24, 2011",2011,4361,"['When', 'Let', 'Me', 'was', 'announced', 'was', 'backlash', 'fans', 'original', 'Swedish', 'film', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'given', 'original', 'film', 'had', 'just', 'came', 'out', 'par', 'course', 'foreign', 'film', 'be', 'remade', 'so', 'soon', 'release', 'nowadays', 'director', '/writer', 'Matt', 'Reeves', 'assured', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'typical', 'remake', 'Instead', 'promised', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'take', 'original', 'novel', 'John', 'Ajvide', 'Lindqvist', 'had', 'also', 'told', 'Lindqvist', 'private', 'conversation', 'had', 'intention', 'copying', 'Swedish', 'film', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'novel', 'wanted', 'use', 'Given', 'novel', 'significantly', 'different', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'plenty', 'new', 'material', 'could', 'have', 'chose', 'example', 'character', 'Hakan', 'novel', 'considerably', 'more', 'disturbing', 'anything', 'Swedish', 'film', 'showed.While', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Reeves', 'film', 'changed', 'made', 'original', 'comments', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'novel', 'Swedish', 'film', 'will', 'know', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'straight', 'up', 'remake', 'film', 'Swedish', 'screenplay', 'beat', 'beat', 'right', 'down', 'elements', 'Swedish', 'film', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'original', 'novel', 'are', 'differences', 'car', 'crash', 'sequence', 'being', 'biggest', 'one', 'most', 'part', 'Tomas', 'Alfredson', 'original', 'film', 'minor', 'cosmetic', 'changes', 'Given', 'how', 'great', 'novel', 'shame', 'took', 'easy', 'way', 'opposed', 'looking', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'fresh', 'eyes', 'giving', 'something', 'different', 'Maybe', 'more', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'been', 'weaker', 'least', 'Reeves', 'could', 'say', 'honesty', 'put', 'own', 'stamp', 'story', 'opposed', 'copying', 'what', 'had', 'gone', 'him.The', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'criteria', 'most', 'American', 'remakes', 'foreign', 'horror', 'films', 'follow', 'nowadays', 'yes', 'know', 'British', 'studio', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Reeves', 'credit', 'not', 'making', 'kids', 'high', 'schoolers', 'trying', 'make', 'horror', 'film', 'adults', 'same', 'time', 'serious', 'director', 'must', 'know', 'making', 'Twilight', 'would', 'be', 'tantamount', 'shooting', 'head', 'So', 'let', 'check', 'go', 'checklist:1', 'More', 'violence', 'gore', 'Check', 'Most', 'violence', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'restrained', 'here', 'everything', 'cranked', 'up', 'eleven', 'times', 'almost', 'ridiculous', 'could', 'list', 'numerous', 'examples', ""'d"", 'end', 'up', 'recapping', 'whole', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'stand', 'finale', 'original', 'finale', 'almost', 'beautiful', 'horrific', 'content', 'here', 'everything', 'loud', 'messy', 'chaotic', 'would', ""n't"", 'seem', 'place', 'other', 'horror', 'film.2', 'Simplified', 'plot', 'Check', 'away', 'most', 'supporting', 'cast', 'subplots', 'Swedish', 'film', 'viewers', 'been', 'positive', 'felt', 'took', 'away', 'depth', 'story', 'original', 'film', 'much', 'victims', 'came', 'real', 'people', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'tragic', 'Here', ""'re"", 'walking', 'blood', 'bags', 'little', 'else.3', 'Less', 'ambiguity', 'Check', 'lot', 'mystery', 'Swedish', 'film', 'were', 'left', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'Here', 'Reeves', 'everything', 'out', 'audience', 'funny', 'thing', 'original', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'that', 'hard', 'follow', 'understand', ""'explaining"", 'off', 'lack', 'respect', 'audience', 'intelligence', 'not', 'Swedish', 'film', 'was', 'Synecdoche', 'New', 'York.4', 'Cleaning', 'up', ""'objectionable"", 'content', 'Check', 'hard', 'explain', 'spoiling', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Swedish', 'film', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'entire', 'film', 'different', 'perspective', 'deals', 'theme', 'many', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'Predictably', 'seriously', 'did', 'anyone', 'think', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'been', 'removed.All', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'best', 'film', 'competently', 'made', 'decent', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Swedish', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'different', 'worthwhile', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'film', 'just', 'simplified', ""'cleaned"", 'up', 'made', 'gorier', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Swedish', 'film', 'then', 'drop', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'watch', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'Swedish', 'film', 'subtitled', 'then', ""'m"", 'sorry', ""'re"", 'missing', 'out', 'one', 'many', 'great', 'films', 'world']",N/A

Believe me, you haven't seen a vamp movie like this, you can be sure.At its heart, the movie is about a relationship between a lonely young boy from a troubled home and a sad, lonely monster in the shape of a beautiful young girl. It is a testament to the brilliance of the original story and the production of this version that the movie can be dark and deeply disturbing while being touching and profound all at once. Make no mistake, there is plenty of blood, gore, and brutality, but it's the connection between the two kids, marvelously played by two fantastic young actors, that make this wonderful movie stand out.

While the original Swedish film, Let The Right One In is superior in certain aspects, this one generally pays an honorable homage to it. This is solidly crafted movie making that stands well on its own. The atmosphere is thick, the score is sometimes gloriously haunting and also often beautiful, then downright terrifying. Indeed the music in this film deserves a lot of credit because it really helps set the tone for the movie and its better than most film scores I have heard in some time. Over all this version is much like the original, and while there are some sparse moments that were done better in the original I do think that certain aspects of this version were much more entertaining. In particular the boys who bully our main character. In this film they are far more menacing and hateful. They simply make much nastier bad guys. Some of the blood and gore is done better here as well. But director Matt Reeves does such a perfect job on this production I am interested in seeing some of his other work. This guy is a gifted director. I do have one minor gripe, and that is Chloe Moretz is not as unique or compelling as the original actress who played Eli, the vampire girl in the original film. Shes just not as creepy despite taking on an evil appearance occasionally while the vampire in the other movie didnt. But there is so much about this film that stands a good deal above most vampire films made over the past 20 years.

She is such a fantastic actress, and has a bright career a head of her.The story is of a boy, Owen, who pretty much lives a sheltered life. His mom is a religious person, who has a drinking problem, and thinks she controls Owen's life, but pretty much ignores him.  At school, he's a target of bullies and doesn't really have any friends. The one day, a mysterious girl, Abby, moves in the same apartment complex (right next door) as him and Owen just sees her at night.  Abby has secrets that she wanted to keep to herself. As the story unfolds, Abby tells Owen her secrets and pretty much Owen finds out that Abby is a vampire.  The two are friends, and Abby tells Owen that he has to stand up to the bullies. Abby and Owen have a wonderful friendship.  That's all I really want to say about the plot. I've left some things out, but I want the viewer to discover the secrets for themselves.The boy who plays Owen does a nice job. We can't help but to feel sorry for him when the bullies torment him. I do have to say that when the bullies were tormenting Owen, that was kind of hard to watch.  Owen is a bit creepy at times, but that just adds to his character.Chole Moretz plays Abby, and as usual, she steals whatever movie she is in. Moretz plays Abby perfectly.  Abby is dark and gritty, and keeps her secrets. As the story unfolds, we can't help but to feel all of the emotions that Abby is feeling. I can't say enough good things about Moretz acting skills. She's a natural talent who has a fantastic and bright acting career in front of her.It's been said that this is a horror movie.....yes and no. It's violent, really violent at times, but I'm not really willing to call it a horror movie. Let's call it a very, very violent drama movie.  It's a story of friendship.

His family has fallen apart, and you never see his father or his mother's face. He is isolated. In comes Abby, played by the very brilliant Chlo&eacute; Grace Moretz. Suspicion ensues, trust sorta happens, and they end up friends. There's a lot more than that, but I can't blab too much. You may already know this, but it's well put together by Mr. Reeves, and I admire this re-imagining of a fine film. McPhee and Moretz are magic together. The original Swedish ""Dragon Tattoo""  films were fine.

1339982,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B003EYVXUU,RMurray847,"[26, 34]","The Swedish film LET THE RIGHT ONE IN (based on the Swedish novel of the same name) was on my top ten list last year.  It was creepy, heartbreaking, violent, original, stylish & very well acted.  It tells the story of a deeply lonely young boy, bullied at school and torn between his divorced parents.  At 12, he's right on the cusp of young manhood...but still he is lagging slightly behind his classmates and thus is a friendless target for some pretty significant abuse.  A new tenant moves into the apartment next to his...and older, weary looking man and a girl about his age.The two strike up a friendship when meeting to chat every night at the monkey bars by his apartment building.  The boy, while sweet and quiet, also is barely masking an urge to inflict violence on his tormentors.  The girl, while sad and mysterious, is drawn to her new neighbor.We come to discover that the girl is a vampire and that the old man has been her companion for many years, and is her procurer of blood.  When he is nearly discovered in action one night...a chain of events is set off that puts everyone in serious peril.The story invites us to sympathize and root for an extremely wicked creature...and we do.  The relationship that develops between the two youngsters (although we know the girl is hardly as young as she appears) is one of the most delicate and touching ""young romances"" we've ever seen...and we give ourselves over completely to their plight.Why have I spent so much time describing a film that I'm not reviewing?  Because the American remake, called LET ME IN, tells the exact same story and has much the same effect.  Yet in the end, it is inferior to the original.Both movies are roughly the same length.  Yet the European original manages to have more plot points.  For example, the boy (named Owen in America, played by Kodi Smit-McPhee) travels to visit his father in the Swedish film, but never gets that far in the American.  These scenes were critical to showing just how disconnected the boy feels.  Also, the Swedish film introduces us to a whole network of unemployed friends, who hang out at local bars and take care of each other.  It is one of their own who falls victim to the vampire, and one of this group that investigates the incident.  The American film provides us with a fairly generic cop (Elias Koteas).The Swedish film rarely relied on any special effects, but the American one uses CGI whenever we see the vampire attacking an adult victim.  Sadly, it is very badly accomplished CGI...and makes what should have been some pretty disturbing scenes almost laughable.But the American film does give us Chloe Moretz (KICK ASS) as Abby, the young vampire.  She's an impressive young actor, and manages a very nice performance (as does Smit-McPhee).  She carries a sadness, because she knows just how different and how WRONG she is.  We can see these two, not as kindred spirits perhaps, but as two halves of a whole.The American film takes place in 1983, in winter, in Los Alamos, New Mexico.  It was filmed on location...BUT the location holds no resonance.  It is just a generic, snowy, dreary small town.  I'm glad they filmed the movie in my home state...but they could have filmed it anywhere with snow.It sounds like I'm hugely criticizing the film...but in reality, if you've not seen the original, LET ME IN should be a pretty terrific movie-going experience.  It takes the vampire genre and breathes new and very original life into it.  It is well acted and emotionally satisfying.  I wish the pace had sometimes been just a little bit faster...but overall, it is worthwhile.  It is most assuredly not for children...because the children in this film are not exactly models of virtue.  If I set the original production out of my mind, LET ME IN is a quiet but almost haunting little horror-romance that is unlike anything out of Hollywood in the last few years.",4,"Not as brilliant as the original, but still engrossing and well acted.",1286668800,"10 10, 2010",2010,3905,"['Swedish', 'film', 'LET', 'THE', 'RIGHT', 'ONE', 'IN', 'based', 'Swedish', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'top', 'ten', 'list', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'creepy', 'heartbreaking', 'violent', 'original', 'stylish', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'story', 'deeply', 'lonely', 'young', 'boy', 'bullied', 'school', 'torn', 'divorced', 'parents', '12', 'right', 'cusp', 'young', 'manhood', 'still', 'lagging', 'slightly', 'classmates', 'thus', 'friendless', 'target', 'pretty', 'significant', 'abuse', 'new', 'tenant', 'apartment', 'older', 'weary', 'looking', 'man', 'girl', 'age.The', 'two', 'strike', 'friendship', 'when', 'meeting', 'chat', 'night', 'monkey', 'bars', 'apartment', 'building', 'boy', 'sweet', 'quiet', 'also', 'barely', 'masking', 'urge', 'inflict', 'violence', 'tormentors', 'girl', 'sad', 'mysterious', 'drawn', 'new', 'neighbor.We', 'come', 'discover', 'girl', 'vampire', 'old', 'man', 'been', 'companion', 'many', 'years', 'procurer', 'blood', 'When', 'nearly', 'discovered', 'action', 'one', 'night', 'chain', 'events', 'set', 'off', 'everyone', 'serious', 'peril.The', 'story', 'sympathize', 'root', 'extremely', 'wicked', 'creature', 'do', 'relationship', 'two', 'youngsters', 'know', 'girl', 'hardly', 'as', 'young', 'one', 'most', 'delicate', 'touching', 'young', 'romances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'give', 'over', 'completely', 'plight.Why', 'have', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'describing', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'reviewing', 'American', 'remake', 'called', 'LET', 'ME', 'IN', 'exact', 'same', 'story', 'much', 'same', 'effect', 'end', 'inferior', 'original.Both', 'movies', 'are', 'roughly', 'same', 'length', 'European', 'original', 'manages', 'have', 'more', 'plot', 'points', 'example', 'boy', 'named', 'Owen', 'America', 'played', 'Kodi', 'Smit-McPhee', 'visit', 'father', 'Swedish', 'film', 'never', 'far', 'American', 'scenes', 'were', 'critical', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'disconnected', 'boy', 'feels', 'Also', 'Swedish', 'film', 'introduces', 'whole', 'network', 'unemployed', 'friends', 'who', 'hang', 'out', 'local', 'bars', 'take', 'care', 'other', 'one', 'own', 'who', 'victim', 'vampire', 'one', 'group', 'incident', 'American', 'film', 'fairly', 'generic', 'cop', 'Elias', 'Koteas', '.The', 'Swedish', 'film', 'rarely', 'relied', 'special', 'effects', 'American', 'one', 'CGI', 'whenever', 'see', 'vampire', 'attacking', 'adult', 'victim', 'Sadly', 'very', 'badly', 'accomplished', 'CGI', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'almost', 'laughable.But', 'American', 'film', 'give', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'KICK', 'ASS', 'Abby', 'young', 'vampire', 'impressive', 'young', 'actor', 'very', 'nice', 'performance', 'Smit-McPhee', 'sadness', 'just', 'how', 'different', 'how', 'WRONG', 'can', 'see', 'two', 'not', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'perhaps', 'two', 'halves', 'whole.The', 'American', 'film', 'place', '1983', 'winter', 'Los', 'Alamos', 'New', 'Mexico', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'BUT', 'location', 'resonance', 'just', 'generic', 'snowy', 'dreary', 'small', 'town', ""'m"", 'glad', 'filmed', 'movie', 'home', 'state', 'could', 'have', 'filmed', 'anywhere', 'snow.It', 'sounds', ""'m"", 'hugely', 'criticizing', 'film', 'reality', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'LET', 'ME', 'IN', 'should', 'be', 'pretty', 'terrific', 'movie-going', 'experience', 'vampire', 'genre', 'new', 'very', 'original', 'life', 'well', 'acted', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'wish', 'pace', 'had', 'sometimes', 'been', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'faster', 'overall', 'worthwhile', 'most', 'assuredly', 'not', 'children', 'children', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'models', 'virtue', 'set', 'original', 'production', 'mind', 'LET', 'ME', 'IN', 'quiet', 'almost', 'haunting', 'little', 'horror-romance', 'anything', 'Hollywood', 'last', 'few', 'years']",N/A

1339984,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003EYVXUU,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 7]","Let Me In (Matt Reeves, 2010)While Let Me In didn't garner anywhere near the critical or popular success I thought it would when it came out late last year, the months between its release and the end of 2010 seem to have allowed it to simmer beneath a lot of surfaces, and over the past few weeks I've started hearing Oscar buzz about it, along with the refrain ""better than the original."" I certainly wouldn't go that far--the original, Let the Right One In, was hands-down the best film of 2008, whereas Let Me In has a great deal of competition for that spot. And yet there is a great deal to like here, and while I did find myself picking it apart in a number of places, I can't deny it's one of the best horror films to come out of the Hollywood machine in the past decade, a feat which is even more impressive given how horribly Hollywood tends to treat its remakes.Plot, in case you missed the original (go see it now, I'll wait) and didn't read the book (which you should also do at your earliest convenience): Owen (The Road's Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a bullied twelve-year-old with delusions of grandeur, parents going through a divorce, and very little hope of anything interesting happening in his life. Until, that is, Abby ((500) Days of Summer's Chloe Moretz) moves in next door with her odd guardian (The Visitor's Richard Jenkins). The two of them begin a hesitant relationship, though Abby warns Owen away repeatedly; still, she seems desperate for human contact, and Owen's passivity draws her; she offers him advice on how to deal with the school's idiot bullies. Meanwhile, a serial killer gears up in the area. You don't have to be a genius to know what's coming, especially since everyone and their mothers has already spoiled it for you, including the film's tagline: Abby is a vampire, and everyone knows it except Owen.High point: Reeves (Cloverfield), working with John Ajvide Lindqvist on this adaptation, stuck a lot closer to the book than did Let the Right One In (which, interestingly, Lindqvist also wrote the adaptation for); within the first five minutes, you understand Owen is a pretty deeply disturbed individual, whereas in the original film he's pretty much the quintessential nice guy who's guaranteed to finish last. Low point: there's still a lot of deviation from the source material, and some of it comes off quite odd. It's obvious they were planning on including a lot more of the book, but veered off at the last minute. (Why is Owen's father even in this movie? And while it's obvious on one level what Abby means when she says ""I'm not a girl"", there's a scene about two-thirds of the way through the film with a photograph that tells me that Reeves and Lindqvist were salivating to include the book's huge, huge plot twist in that regard... which then disappears, never to be seen again.)High point: Smit-McPhee and Moretz are very good actors, probably as good as Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leanderson (Oskar and Eli in the original). Low point: everyone else in the movie either comes off as cardboard (Cara Buono, playing Owen's mother, is a prime example, or the bullies) or doesn't get nearly enough screen time to really let their talents come forth (Jenkins, or Elias Koteas as the investigating officer).High point: whereas the original film focused almost solely on the romance angle (it would be really, really tough to even call Let the Right One In a horror film were it not for the ""what happens if I don't invite you in?"" scene... oh, more on that next paragraph), Let Me In definitely wants to play in horror movie territory, and it does it passably well--though this is a horror film in the vein of such recent faves of mine as Shallow Ground and Deadbirds, where if you come expecting ultragore, you're bound to be disappointed. Low point: a lot of what's missing from the book is the themes and scenes that really drive the horror angle home. Most notably absent is Abby's/Eli's sociopathy; it's never less than obvious in the book that all she really needs Owen/Oskar for is as a replacement handler. She wants to break through that wall inside her that keeps her from having friends (and lovers, one assumes; the pedophilia aspect of the book is touched on here, but only barely, in one brief scene, and you probably wouldn't even notice it had you not read the book), but she's incapable of doing so. Here, Abby seems... well, a more normal, well-adjusted kid than Owen, which is odd when you consider the fact that Abby is a couple of centuries older than you are. Also missing are the neighbor who owns the basement room (and whose mother, in the novel, is having a burgeoning relationship with the Elias Koteas character), the barflies who provide a major subplot (though the main pair are kind of remade here as a yuppie couple), and, as noted above, Owen's dad, who is mentioned once briefly, then appears in a phone conversation, and... that's it. And I'm just scratching the surface.High point: what gore there is in this movie is really nicely done. (The goriest scene in the film is, ironically, also its funniest; Richard Jenkins knows comic timing.) Low point: if you're going to blow one of the gore scenes, the one to blow is not the iconic ""what happens if I don't invite you in?"" scene. Oh, god, what a letdown. If you have seen this, see the original if only for that scene, if you haven't, to show how effective a minimal special effects budget can still be.So yeah, not as good as the original film, which was as good as (though a different beast than) the novel on which both are based. But still, in most cases the good outweighs the bad here, and if you compare it to the other horror movies that came out in 2010--at least those I've seen--it stands head and shoulders above the crowd.

1339985,A30JVMVY6KL3EK,B003EYVXUU,Robert D. Watson,"[3, 3]","When I saw the previews for Let Me In, I figured it was a cheesy vampire story where instead of love-crushed teens, we'd have a slightly younger generation, probably going on Freddy-like killing sprees.  Needless to say, I wasn't interested.  But when it was the only new movie on the shelf I hadn't seen, I figured it was worth a shot.It might be one of my favorite movies of all time.Let Me In is a horror movie for people who don't really like horror movies.  Sure, there's vampires, serial killers, downright evil bullies, and a hefty body count, but the movie isn't really about that.  It's about a relationship forged between a skinny little boy who's constantly tormented, and a young girl who is cast out from the world and unable to interact with it due to her vampirism.  The majority of the violence is not typically shown on screen, but the bloody clothes and walls probably make this too intense for some, but those people are truly missing out.The acting is phenomenal, and the director does a marvelous job of integrating all the many fantastic elements of the story to create an atmosphere that is dark and brooding, but still the perfect place for two children to form a bond of friendship.

Their outcast bond fortifies Owen to stand up to the bullies.  But when Owen confirms his suspicions that Chloe has a big secret, it's too late; his fate is sealed.

Zwick,"[2, 3]","American moviemakers don't have an especially impressive track record when it comes to adapting hit foreign films for stateside audiences (who generally avoid like the plague anything with subtitles).  But with ""Let Me In,"" a remake of the highly acclaimed Swedish film ""Let the Right One In,"" Hollywood finally gets one right.  This somber and chilling tale of a friendless, put-upon 12-year-old boy who becomes romantically (albeit platonically) involved with the vampire-girl next door emerges as a sort of antidote to the far more crowd-pleasing and commercially successful ""Twilight"" series, providing a more subdued and thoughtful variation on the same theme.Transferring its setting from Scandinavia to an equally frigid and snowbound Los Alamos, New Mexico, the remake remains true to the core elements that made the original such a quality film in the first place:  its artful tone, its unsensationalistic approach to its material, and its incisive look at what it means to be a misfit in a world in which conformity is prized above all else - and never more so than during adolescence.  For Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) are both outcasts from society, Abby quite literally since her condition makes it impossible for her to interact with others in any kind of meaningful way (except to devour their blood).  But Owen is no less of an outsider, since his diminutiveness, shyness and dreamy nature make him an easy and perpetual target for the town's bullies.  It's no surprise, then, that Owen and Abby eventually reach out to one another for love and acceptance, despite the seeming impossibility of their relationship.As a horror film, ""Let Me In"" doesn't hold back from showing us the requisite gore and grue that comes with the genre, but director Matt Reeve's script is far more concerned with the interaction among characters and the exploration of theme than it is with piling up easily achievable gross-out moments.  For instance, the gruesome task of securing victims that Abby and others close to her are forced to do to assure her continued survival helps to make this a profoundly sad and emotionally unsettling story.Smit-McPhee and Moretz are both superb as the inter-species Romeo and Juliet, and there's a fine supporting cast to boot.In this case at least, ""Let Me In"" is a command well worth obeying.",4,Faithful remake,1308873600,"06 24, 2011",2011,2352,"['American', 'moviemakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'especially', 'impressive', 'track', 'record', 'when', 'adapting', 'hit', 'foreign', 'films', 'stateside', 'audiences', 'who', 'generally', 'avoid', 'plague', 'anything', 'subtitles', 'Let', 'Me', 'remake', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'Swedish', 'film', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'Hollywood', 'finally', 'one', 'right', 'somber', 'chilling', 'tale', 'friendless', 'put-upon', '12-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'romantically', 'platonically', 'involved', 'vampire-girl', 'next', 'door', 'sort', 'antidote', 'far', 'more', 'crowd-pleasing', 'commercially', 'successful', 'Twilight', 'series', 'providing', 'more', 'subdued', 'thoughtful', 'variation', 'same', 'theme.Transferring', 'setting', 'Scandinavia', 'equally', 'frigid', 'snowbound', 'Los', 'Alamos', 'New', 'Mexico', 'remake', 'true', 'core', 'elements', 'made', 'original', 'such', 'quality', 'film', 'first', 'place', 'artful', 'tone', 'unsensationalistic', 'approach', 'material', 'incisive', 'look', 'what', 'be', 'misfit', 'world', 'conformity', 'prized', 'else', 'never', 'more', 'so', 'adolescence', 'Owen', 'Kodi', 'Smit-McPhee', 'Abby', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'are', 'outcasts', 'society', 'Abby', 'quite', 'literally', 'condition', 'impossible', 'interact', 'others', 'kind', 'meaningful', 'way', 'devour', 'blood', 'Owen', 'less', 'outsider', 'diminutiveness', 'shyness', 'dreamy', 'nature', 'make', 'easy', 'perpetual', 'target', 'town', 'bullies', 'surprise', 'then', 'Owen', 'Abby', 'eventually', 'out', 'one', 'love', 'acceptance', 'seeming', 'impossibility', 'relationship.As', 'horror', 'film', 'Let', 'Me', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'showing', 'requisite', 'gore', 'grue', 'genre', 'director', 'Matt', 'Reeve', 'script', 'far', 'more', 'concerned', 'interaction', 'characters', 'exploration', 'theme', 'piling', 'up', 'easily', 'achievable', 'gross-out', 'moments', 'instance', 'gruesome', 'task', 'securing', 'victims', 'Abby', 'others', 'close', 'are', 'forced', 'do', 'assure', 'continued', 'survival', 'make', 'profoundly', 'sad', 'emotionally', 'unsettling', 'story.Smit-McPhee', 'Moretz', 'are', 'superb', 'inter-species', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'boot.In', 'case', 'least', 'Let', 'Me', 'command', 'well', 'worth', 'obeying']",N/A

As some commentators  have indicated, the subtlties and nuancies of the original film and book are way out of the league of the english film, but it would seem that the author  of the original book is happy that his own story in fiction has made it out so far, so I suspect those that are motivated may go to read the original book in translation.The film is chilling and suspenseful in a broad sense, but not as scarey as I would have hoped for, especially given the scope of the subject matter.

Though Let Me In actually does have vampires that do adhere to the basic vampire tenets like, as the title suggests, they have be invited in, Let Me In is not really a vampire movie, they are really just an allegory for the bulling that can go on during school.  Vampires in the movie are neither glorified nor vilified; just like the humans in the film, are just trying to get by.Kodi Smit-McPhee (The Road) is the focus of the bullying and has to sit and take it until someone new moves in.  Chloe Grace Moretz (500 Days of Summer) teaches him to stand up for himself, while Smit-McPhee re-teaches her how to be a kid, something she has probably has been for decades if not longer.  It is clear that Moretz and her father figure, Richard Jenkins (The Visitor)  do not kill for sport, or for the fun of it, they do it to survive and there is a guilt behind their eyes when they do that just adds another level to the story.It is that guilt which is why there is not as much killing in the film, but when there is, it is violent enough to satisfy any horror buff and the bullying scenes are just as terrifying at times.  There is a particular graphic one take car crash that will make you wonder just how they did it (and if so, you will be in luck because there is a special feature on the DVD that goes into detail of how they pulled it off).  It definitely earns its R rating.

1339997,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B003EYVXUU,Scott Schiefelbein,"[8, 8]","Matt Reeves' ""Let Me In,"" an American version of a Swedish film (English title, ""Let the Right One In""), succeeds brilliantly where so many American reworkings of European films fail.  Far from a pale retread or an empty star vehicle, ""Let Me In"" may be the most intelligent and thought-provoking vampire movie ever.The film is set in Los Alamos, New Mexico, in the early 1980s.  Not only does the name ""Los Alamos"" set an ominous tone from the outset, but the time period is a good one for alienation and abandonment (as well as some pretty good tunes on the soundtrack).  Divorce was growing more and more common, but it was still one of those issues that carried a fair weight of shame.  Naturally, our hero is a kind, meek boy named Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee of ""The Road"") whose parents are divorcing.  Owen's mother appears to be the short straw in the broken marriage as she's a bit of a religious nut who drowns her agony in wine before she falls asleep on the couch.  Owen's dad seems decent, but he never gets closer to Owen than a concerned phone call.Owen is alone in a cold world.  Friendless and an only child, he's bullied at school by three bigger boys.  The bullying scenes are handled extremely well - they are just as uncomfortable and riveting as the more bloody action scenes the movie has in store.Alone, that is, until the mysterious Abby arrives.  Abby (Chloe Moretz) is either attractively mysterious or mysteriously attractive - she walks through the snow without shoes and doesn't get cold.  Her melancholy dad (Richard Jenkins) is a melancholy, tortured soul, for reasons the movie makes painfully clear.  Jenkins, one of our most under-rated actors, does a magnificent job with his few lines, including his weighty admonition to Abby, ""Please stay away from that boy.""Owen eventually learns that Abby is a vampire, but he doesn't care - she is kind to him. In a weaker movie, Abby would become Owen's guardian angel, dispensing comeuppances and one-liners while allowing Owen to become his school's alpha dog.  ""Let Me In"" has another message - there is a high price to be paid for being a vampire's friend.

Yarbrough""","[3, 5]","The cover of the DVD quotes Stephen King as saying this is ""the best American horror film in the last 20 years.""  Too bad it's really an American remake of the Swedish film Let The Right One In.  If you haven't seen the original and don't like movies with subtitles, don't worry.  The American remake will suffice for you.  It's the eerily slow tempo and oddities of both films that really make you shiver.  It's the story of a lonely young boy, the victim of bullies at his school, who befriends a young female vampire who moves in next door in his apartment complex.  They both give each other a bit of confidence, despite the consequences a friendship between them could cause.The differences between the two films are probably numerous to some who have obsessed over them, but as far as the storyline goes, they are pretty much the same.  Obviously, there's a bit of emotion lost from having to read the subtitles which non-Swedish speaking Americans will get to enjoy in this film.  But it's not all about the dialogue.  There are long bouts of scary silence in both films where you don't always want to know what's happening (but you do), and you don't need someone talking to tell you. The two lonely friends sitting outside in the snow on a jungle gym beneath the yellow security light plays on our emotions just as much as seeing Owen, the young boy, get picked on by his bullies.Since I've seen both films, I'm going to tell you what I liked better about the Americanized version.  First, I didn't mind the lack of Owen's father in the movie.  His scenes are brief in the original, but not really needed for anything other than to establish is parents are separated but Owen still has a relationship with both.  The lack of a father figure in his life is not really the reason Owen is such a weak character that always gets picked on at school.  Again, dialogue quickly establishes that his parents are getting divorced.  There's only a phone call to his father in the remake, where he reaches out to him to ask if there is such a thing as evil.I also thought Abby's caregiver played much more of a part in this film and we really got to see his conflict play out.  There are differences in his ""killing"" scenes in both films, but the reason behind them is the same.  In the remake, however, we see that the victims live in the same apartment complex and Owen knows who they are by watching them through a telescope in his bedroom window.All in all, it's not a bad remake.  Like I said, if you haven't seen the Swedish version, you won't be missing anything.  The dynamic and sadness of both films is definitely there, even the bizarre ending which you'd never expect.  The one thing that I didn't like about the remake though was Owen asking Abby if she was a vampire.  I also didn't like the scenes where we got to see her face after she had fed and her appearance and eyes had become more monster-like.  NOT seeing this sort of teases your mind and increases the intensity, and while Abby doesn't answer Owen's question, there was no need to establish what she was.  What's more important is that Owen doesn't care about that.  He only cares about her friendship.Definitely worth a watch if you have not (or even have) seen the original, or if you enjoy a ""good"" vampire flick.  I agree with King that it's one of the best horror films lately.

I loved ""Let the right one in"" and I love ""Let me in"" as well. I just love the friendship between the two kids. You almost wish you had a friend like Abby when you were a kid. If you love horror movies this is not your typical horror film. There is a love story mixed in with the gory scenes. Also you are actually sympathetic to the killer who happens to be the young girl. This is what makes this story so unique. Not only are you hoping for the killer to get away you are also feeling sympathy for her. Abby is vulnerable even though she has super human strength. Chloe Grace Moertz rocked in ""Kick Ass"" she also did a terrific job here, as a vampire trapped in a 12 year old body. Chloe Grace Moertz has made very wise decisions in choosing her films. Just like Natalie Portman stayed away from kid movies, so far Chloe has done the same. I believe this gives her an advantage over other child actors. Some child actors are stuck with the perception they can only do kiddie movies. Chloe has already jumped into adult movies and is doing better than some adult actors.

This film explores the dark and dreary side of being a vampire and what you would do to get your precious life-sustaining blood. This is an accurate portrayal of such an existence if it were ""real"".The two lead characters carried most of this film, and they were fantastic. The girl whom plays the vampire did a terrific job. Her character is desperate to survive. She is intelligent and street-wise. Her bloodlust is uncanny. The smell of a drop of blood turns her into a raging beast. There is no corniness or cheese-factor in her character. Remember, this is not about the fun of living forever. The relationship she develops with a weary, quiet youth has plenty of twists and turns.. and thrills.Also, I absolutely loved the fact that this takes place in the 80's.

A bullied recluse of a boy with a single parent goes gaga when a young girl moves into his neighborhood seemingly with the same reclusive traits and a single parent. But when the girl turns out to be a vampire (oh, am I really giving anything away there to anyone reading this?), does it freak him out or draw him in?A vampire that does not have human ""familiars""--people who assist vampires by night and more importantly watch over the vampire ""nest"" by day--is at great risk to being hunted and killed while the sun shines. Dracula's Renfield was a familiar but not referred to as one inthe novel.

1340012,A2ARRAMXWT83PT,B003EYVXUU,Steven Adam Renkovish,"[204, 223]","Let Me In is one of the most beautiful films of the year, and probably the best remake that I have ever seen. It is based on the Swedish film, Let The Right One In, which was released two years ago to monumental acclaim from both critics and art-house audiences alike. This touching story, concerning a young man's crush on a 12 year old vampire named Eli, captured the hearts and minds of everyone who was lucky enough to see it. If Ingmar Bergman were to direct a vampire-themed film, it would look a lot like this. However, one should not think of the film as yet another entry into the recent ""vampire"" craze. It is much more than that. This is the film that Twilight only wishes that it could be.The remake deviates structurally from the original, only in that the opening is a bit different, and a few minor characters have been altered or dropped altogether. The integrity of the storytelling remains intact, and as a result, much of the remake resembles the original in all of its snow-drenched glory.Kodi Smit-McPhee plays Owen, a lonely young man who is constantly bullied at school in the most brutal fashion. He spends his evenings at home playing with knives, and spying on the attractive neighbor next door. In addition to these disturbing quirks, he has an almost addictive fondness for Now and Laters, and constantly eats the candy throughout the film. Chloe Moretz plays Abby, a young girl who moves in next door with a man that we initially assume is her father. The two meet on the playground one night, and bond over the intricacies of a Rubick's Cube. Soon, Owen develops a crush on his new friend, oblivious that Abby is really a vampire, and that her ""dad"" is in fact a serial killer, who creeps out into the night, stalking and killing random victims in order to bring buckets of blood back to Abby, in order that she will survive.Meanwhile, an older cop tries to figure out who the mysterious killer is, as the bodies continue to surface. As far as Owen is concerned, the bullying still continues at school, but with a little advice from Abby, and a little bit of weight training, Owen realizes that he can stand up for himself in one of the film's most shocking - and darkly comic - sequences. It doesn't take long for Owen to realize who and what Abby really is. In all of his fright and confusion, he decides to stay by her side, and as a result, Abby vows to protect Owen in the only way that she knows how.As I said, this is one of the best films of the year. Both of the leads deserve Oscar nominations for their layered performances. The cinematography is breathtaking. The score is beautiful, although there are moments in the film that could do without a background score. This is my only criticism of this otherwise perfect film. Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) has crafted a worthy tribute with Let Me In.It is worth mentioning that this film is rated R, and while the film centers on two adolescents, it is not a film for the 12 and under crowd. It is much too disturbing at times, and the language is pretty rough. I would also encourage Twilighters to see the film, so that they may have a clear example of a film (Let Me In) and a product (Twilight).",5,Best of 2010 Series: LET ME IN,1287532800,"10 20, 2010",2010,3184,"['Let', 'Me', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'films', 'year', 'probably', 'best', 'remake', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'based', 'Swedish', 'film', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'was', 'released', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'monumental', 'acclaim', 'critics', 'art-house', 'audiences', 'alike', 'touching', 'story', 'concerning', 'young', 'man', 'crush', '12', 'year', 'old', 'vampire', 'named', 'Eli', 'captured', 'hearts', 'minds', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'were', 'direct', 'vampire-themed', 'film', 'would', 'look', 'lot', 'However', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'think', 'film', 'yet', 'entry', 'recent', 'vampire', 'craze', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'Twilight', 'only', 'could', 'be.The', 'remake', 'deviates', 'structurally', 'original', 'only', 'opening', 'bit', 'different', 'few', 'minor', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'altered', 'dropped', 'altogether', 'integrity', 'storytelling', 'intact', 'result', 'much', 'remake', 'original', 'snow-drenched', 'glory.Kodi', 'Smit-McPhee', 'plays', 'Owen', 'lonely', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'constantly', 'bullied', 'school', 'most', 'brutal', 'fashion', 'evenings', 'home', 'playing', 'knives', 'spying', 'attractive', 'neighbor', 'next', 'door', 'addition', 'disturbing', 'quirks', 'almost', 'addictive', 'fondness', 'Now', 'Laters', 'constantly', 'candy', 'film', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'Abby', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'next', 'door', 'man', 'initially', 'assume', 'father', 'two', 'meet', 'playground', 'one', 'night', 'bond', 'intricacies', 'Rubick', 'Cube', 'Soon', 'Owen', 'crush', 'new', 'friend', 'oblivious', 'Abby', 'really', 'vampire', 'dad', 'fact', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'out', 'night', 'stalking', 'killing', 'random', 'victims', 'order', 'bring', 'buckets', 'blood', 'back', 'Abby', 'order', 'will', 'survive.Meanwhile', 'older', 'cop', 'tries', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'mysterious', 'killer', 'bodies', 'continue', 'surface', 'As', 'far', 'Owen', 'concerned', 'bullying', 'still', 'school', 'little', 'advice', 'Abby', 'little', 'bit', 'weight', 'training', 'Owen', 'can', 'stand', 'up', 'one', 'film', 'most', 'shocking', 'darkly', 'comic', 'sequences', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'Owen', 'realize', 'who', 'what', 'Abby', 'really', 'fright', 'confusion', 'stay', 'side', 'result', 'Abby', 'protect', 'Owen', 'only', 'way', 'how.As', 'said', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'leads', 'deserve', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'layered', 'performances', 'cinematography', 'breathtaking', 'score', 'beautiful', 'are', 'moments', 'film', 'could', 'do', 'background', 'score', 'only', 'criticism', 'otherwise', 'perfect', 'film', 'Matt', 'Reeves', 'Cloverfield', 'crafted', 'worthy', 'tribute', 'Let', 'Me', 'In.It', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'film', 'rated', 'R', 'film', 'centers', 'two', 'adolescents', 'not', 'film', '12', 'crowd', 'much', 'too', 'disturbing', 'times', 'language', 'pretty', 'rough', 'would', 'also', 'encourage', 'Twilighters', 'see', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'clear', 'example', 'film', 'Let', 'Me', 'product', 'Twilight']",N/A

1340015,A382JTM7S9LGEC,B003EYVXUU,surfergirl,"[6, 8]","**REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**Let Me In is the American adaptation of the 2008 Swedish vampire film, Let The Right One In (which I haven't seen for any basis of comparison, although I have heard awesome things about it). Rated at 89% on the Rotten Tomatoes tomatometer, Let Me In did not disappoint on either the horror front or the romance front. It's not your typical vampire film, nor is it your typical boy meets girl love story. Instead, it is an amazing combination of the two, producing a compelling movie experience that is dark and terrible as it is sweet.Owen (played by Kodi Smit-McPhee from The Road) is a young boy who gets bullied at school and spends his time entertaining himself alone in the courtyard of his apartment building. One evening, two mysterious people show up in at night and move into the building - a young girl and her father. But Abby (played by Chloe Grace Moretz from KickAss) is no ordinary twelve-year-old girl, she is a centuries year old vampire. Despite her warning to Owen that they can't be friends, they are drawn together by a shared loneliness and a relationship starts to form. The core of this film really centers around these two young people - their dialogue, their shared silent glances, their emotions, and their budding feelings for each other. Their relationship is dark and sweet because you can't help becoming invested in them and what will essentially be a doomed romance, because Abby is what she is. On that note, I thought it was incredibly poignant when we learn exactly who Abby's father is, and know that that will also be Owen's fate, should he choose to stay with Abby.Sweetness aside, this film also has enough horror and shocking moments to have had me covering my eyes. Abby is terrifying as a quick-moving, evil-eyed vampire with her snarling blood-drenched mouth, leaving you in no doubt of the creature that she is. She rips into flesh like nobody's business, snapping necks and tearing bloody chunks out with her teeth. Even Abby's father who garbs himself from head to toe in a black garbage bag is creepy and frightening when he goes hunting for Abby. The scarier parts of this movie only add dimension to the sweeter parts, like Abby and Owen's interaction, and it just makes you feel for them more because there's no ""happy ever after"" for them. He'll kill for her, protect her, feed her, and she'll leave him behind when he gets too old ... just like the boy-turned-old-man before him. It's so tragic.I thought Abby was a complex and fascinating character. She drew me in because she's doomed to be a child forever trapped in the life of this monstrous vampire, and a lot of how she is comes across as very childlike. For me, she was as good as Kirsten Dunst in Interview With A Vampire. Like Kirsten, she played the vampire versus the child amazingly well - the violent growling at her father for not getting any blood versus the sweetness of her normal girl voice is incredible. Her ability to be both monster and innocent was phenomenal. I don't think she's manipulative and scheming as suggested by other reviewers in terms of looking for someone else to take care of her. She tried to leave Owen for his own good, and ends up coming back to save his life. So that for me, erased the whole thought that her actions were contrived to make Owen fall in love with her. I think she also fell in love with him, and she knows that he protected her, too.Owen was also a complex character, although in a different way, almost an opposite way to Abby. He's a powerless bullied kid who wants to awaken the monster inside of him - he wants to punish his tormenters. This is evident when he's stabbing the tree with a penknife, hissing ""you scared, little girl?"" It's interesting because he's afraid of a few kids, but yet he's able to face and even love the utter terror of a creature like a vampire.I especially loved the juxtaposition of Let Me In with Romeo and Juliet, which Owen was reading in school, in terms of highlighting the beauty and tragedy of their relationship. Let Me In is a beautiful and terrifying film. I couldn't stop thinking about it for hours after I'd seen it, especially about Owen's eventual choice and the cost of such a choice. It was both bittersweet and chilling.Superbly acted and one of the best vampire movies I've ever seen, I would rate Let Me In 5 out of 5 stars.",5,Beautiful and bittersweet story,1300579200,"03 20, 2011",2011,4369,"['**REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS**Let', 'Me', 'American', 'adaptation', '2008', 'Swedish', 'vampire', 'film', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'basis', 'comparison', 'have', 'heard', 'awesome', 'things', 'Rated', '89', '%', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'tomatometer', 'Let', 'Me', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'horror', 'front', 'romance', 'front', 'not', 'typical', 'vampire', 'film', 'typical', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'love', 'story', 'Instead', 'amazing', 'combination', 'two', 'producing', 'compelling', 'movie', 'experience', 'dark', 'terrible', 'sweet.Owen', 'played', 'Kodi', 'Smit-McPhee', 'Road', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'bullied', 'school', 'time', 'entertaining', 'alone', 'courtyard', 'apartment', 'building', 'One', 'evening', 'two', 'mysterious', 'people', 'show', 'up', 'night', 'move', 'building', 'young', 'girl', 'father', 'Abby', 'played', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'KickAss', 'ordinary', 'twelve-year-old', 'girl', 'centuries', 'year', 'old', 'vampire', 'warning', 'Owen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'friends', 'are', 'drawn', 'together', 'shared', 'loneliness', 'relationship', 'form', 'core', 'film', 'really', 'centers', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'dialogue', 'shared', 'silent', 'glances', 'emotions', 'budding', 'feelings', 'other', 'relationship', 'dark', 'sweet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'becoming', 'invested', 'what', 'will', 'essentially', 'be', 'doomed', 'romance', 'Abby', 'what', 'note', 'thought', 'was', 'incredibly', 'poignant', 'when', 'learn', 'exactly', 'who', 'Abby', 'father', 'know', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'Owen', 'fate', 'should', 'choose', 'stay', 'Abby.Sweetness', 'aside', 'film', 'also', 'enough', 'horror', 'shocking', 'moments', 'have', 'had', 'covering', 'eyes', 'Abby', 'terrifying', 'quick-moving', 'evil-eyed', 'vampire', 'snarling', 'blood-drenched', 'mouth', 'leaving', 'doubt', 'creature', 'flesh', 'nobody', 'business', 'snapping', 'necks', 'tearing', 'bloody', 'chunks', 'out', 'teeth', 'Even', 'Abby', 'father', 'who', 'head', 'toe', 'black', 'garbage', 'bag', 'creepy', 'frightening', 'when', 'hunting', 'Abby', 'scarier', 'parts', 'movie', 'only', 'add', 'dimension', 'sweeter', 'parts', 'Abby', 'Owen', 'interaction', 'just', 'feel', 'more', 'happy', 'ever', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'protect', 'feed', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'behind', 'when', 'too', 'old', 'just', 'boy-turned-old-man', 'so', 'tragic.I', 'thought', 'Abby', 'was', 'complex', 'fascinating', 'character', 'drew', 'doomed', 'be', 'child', 'forever', 'trapped', 'life', 'monstrous', 'vampire', 'lot', 'how', 'very', 'childlike', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Interview', 'A', 'Vampire', 'Kirsten', 'played', 'vampire', 'child', 'amazingly', 'well', 'violent', 'growling', 'father', 'not', 'getting', 'blood', 'sweetness', 'normal', 'girl', 'voice', 'incredible', 'ability', 'be', 'monster', 'innocent', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'manipulative', 'scheming', 'suggested', 'other', 'reviewers', 'terms', 'looking', 'someone', 'else', 'take', 'care', 'tried', 'leave', 'Owen', 'own', 'good', 'up', 'coming', 'back', 'save', 'life', 'erased', 'whole', 'thought', 'actions', 'were', 'contrived', 'make', 'Owen', 'fall', 'love', 'think', 'also', 'fell', 'love', 'protected', 'too.Owen', 'was', 'also', 'complex', 'character', 'different', 'way', 'almost', 'opposite', 'way', 'Abby', 'powerless', 'bullied', 'kid', 'who', 'awaken', 'monster', 'punish', 'tormenters', 'evident', 'when', 'stabbing', 'tree', 'penknife', 'hissing', 'scared', 'little', 'girl', 'interesting', 'afraid', 'few', 'kids', 'yet', 'able', 'face', 'even', 'love', 'utter', 'terror', 'creature', 'vampire.I', 'especially', 'loved', 'juxtaposition', 'Let', 'Me', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Owen', 'was', 'reading', 'school', 'terms', 'highlighting', 'beauty', 'tragedy', 'relationship', 'Let', 'Me', 'beautiful', 'terrifying', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'hours', ""'d"", 'seen', 'especially', 'Owen', 'eventual', 'choice', 'cost', 'choice', 'was', 'bittersweet', 'chilling.Superbly', 'acted', 'one', 'best', 'vampire', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'would', 'rate', 'Let', 'Me', '5', '5', 'stars']",N/A
1340016,A1K3NQAO49LXL2,B003EYVXUU,"Surferofromantica ""S.O.R.""","[4, 4]","One of the best movies I saw last year was ""Let The Right One In"", a Norwegian vampire movie that was bleak and arty and basically about the morally ambiguous relationship between two twelve-year-old kids. I walked into this one five minutes late, which I normally don't do, but I thought it would be okay because the credits usually eat up five minutes anyway. But in this case, the movie had started already, at a scene that I knew was halfway through the film. I thought to myself ""did I come in one hour and five minutes late instead of just five minutes late?"" But what the director does is he starts at an important scene from the middle, then jumps back two weeks.The film is a very faithful remake of the original, and it's always interesting to see how the director's going to stage any given scene. The one thing that is very different is that neither of Owen's divorcing parents are ever seen; the father is only heard on the phone, and the mum, who he lives with, is only seen from the shoulders down, heightening the sense of Owen's isolation and loneliness. No adult befriends Owen, and his classmates are either indifferent or hostile. Owen's moral lapse comes out strongly in this film, and he's so happy to finally have a companion that he forgets that Abby is a heartless killer.One complaint is the soundtrack, which is too moody, and when it turns moody it projects that something bad is going to happen. I don't remember much music in the original at all.

The title relates to one of the ground rules of vampirism:  vampires must be invited in before they can pounce.Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz, ""Kick-Ass"") meets Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee, ""The Road""), the product of a broken home and the victim of brutal bullying at school, in the courtyard of their apartment complex.  They both appear to be twelve-year-olds, but Abby says they can never be friends.  Her behavior is odd.  She walks in the snow barefoot and never goes to school.  Still, the two form a bond against the background of a series of gruesome murders.Horror movies seldom achieve the level of ""Let Me In.""  It all comes down to a solid script with believable performances.  I have no problem with screenwriters and directors tweaking the vampire legend to give their movies an interesting spin.  What bothers me is a vampire that is more yuppie sauntering around in daylight than nocturnal bloodsucker.  In this film, Abby follows in the grand tradition of vampires.  Her evident victim, Owen, actually encourages her friendship and she soon becomes his protector.  But what will eventually happen to Owen?Ms. Moretz is very good as Abby -- charming, creepy, scary, sympathetic, savage as the plot dictates.  She sells her character.  Director Reeves wisely duplicates the frigid atmosphere of the Swedish original.  The graphic scenes are shot with a minimum of light to keep them both frightening and mysterious.  Often, American remakes of foreign films fall short, but ""Let Me In"" retains the bleak, haunting mood of the original while pepping up the pace and incorporating more action.  It is a well-made movie worth your attention.Bonus features on both the R-rated Blu-ray and DVD editions include audio commentary with writer/director Matt Reeves, making-of and art of special effects featurettes, unrated deleted scenes, and a step-by-step look at the creation of one of the movie's action sequences.",5,Atmospheric Vampire Tale,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,2193,"['romantic', 'fluff', 'angst', 'Twilight', 'movies', 'Let', 'Me', 'remake', 'Swedish', 'film', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'vampire', 'back', 'traditional', 'cinematic', 'conventions', 'even', 'director', 'Matt', 'transplants', 'location', 'New', 'Mexico', '1983', 'title', 'one', 'ground', 'rules', 'vampirism', 'vampires', 'must', 'be', 'invited', 'can', 'pounce.Abby', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'Kick-Ass', 'Owen', 'Kodi', 'Smit-McPhee', 'Road', 'product', 'broken', 'home', 'victim', 'brutal', 'bullying', 'school', 'courtyard', 'apartment', 'complex', 'appear', 'be', 'twelve-year-olds', 'Abby', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'friends', 'behavior', 'odd', 'snow', 'barefoot', 'never', 'school', 'Still', 'two', 'form', 'bond', 'background', 'series', 'gruesome', 'murders.Horror', 'movies', 'seldom', 'achieve', 'level', 'Let', 'Me', 'down', 'solid', 'script', 'believable', 'performances', 'have', 'problem', 'screenwriters', 'directors', 'tweaking', 'vampire', 'legend', 'give', 'movies', 'interesting', 'spin', 'What', 'vampire', 'more', 'yuppie', 'sauntering', 'around', 'daylight', 'nocturnal', 'bloodsucker', 'film', 'Abby', 'grand', 'tradition', 'vampires', 'evident', 'victim', 'Owen', 'actually', 'friendship', 'soon', 'protector', 'what', 'will', 'eventually', 'happen', 'Owen', 'Ms', 'Moretz', 'very', 'good', 'Abby', 'charming', 'creepy', 'scary', 'sympathetic', 'savage', 'plot', 'dictates', 'character', 'Director', 'Reeves', 'wisely', 'frigid', 'atmosphere', 'Swedish', 'original', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'minimum', 'light', 'keep', 'frightening', 'mysterious', 'Often', 'American', 'remakes', 'foreign', 'films', 'fall', 'short', 'Let', 'Me', 'bleak', 'haunting', 'mood', 'original', 'pepping', 'up', 'pace', 'incorporating', 'more', 'action', 'well-made', 'movie', 'attention.Bonus', 'features', 'R-rated', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'editions', 'include', 'audio', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Matt', 'Reeves', 'making-of', 'art', 'special', 'effects', 'featurettes', 'unrated', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'step-by-step', 'look', 'creation', 'one', 'movie', 'action', 'sequences']",N/A

Not having seen the original Swedish film, my review comes only from my impressions of this version. On the whole, I found the story troubling in a number of ways. Placing the film almost entirely from the boy's perspective suggests the various vulnerabilities he faces, victimized by school bullies, abandoned by his separated parents (the father having moved out, the mother resorting to alcohol and sleeping pills), and finding consolation only in candy and voyeurism, the boy seems a product of any number of cliches. Frankly, the film telegraphs its patterns early on, and there can be little question after the first half hour how it will end. The film works for me, though, in how we reach this ending. There are some stylistic turns, such as camera placement in vehicles, that can be absolutely disorienting. There are subtle indictments of institutions--the most blatant being the overcrowded school system, where even the most dedicated teacher cannot possibly keep an eye on all students--that suggest that children face any number of difficulties aside from the ""monsters"" of fantasy. There is also the restrained employment of conventional horror elements--shocking when they occur, not used so much to dull the senses.

Standland,"[5, 7]","""Let Me In"".The title sends a shudder up your spine.Based on the novel by Swedish author John Lindquist ""Let The Right One In"", this may be the best vampire genre movie I've watched since Stephen King's vampire masterpiece ""Salem's Lot"".An independent film with a powerful cast including ""Kick Ass"" star Chloe Grace Moretz, it's based in 1983 and tells the story of 12 year old Owen who's brutally bullied at school, has divorced parents, an alcoholic mother he lives with, and is desperately seeking an identity. He is soon befriended by new 12 year old neighbor 'Abby' (Moretz), a girl with a dark secret.""Let Me In"" is a love story, a redemption story, a tragedy, and vampire movie all rolled into one. Of course, it is the polar opposite of the usual Hollywood flash and glamour portrayal of vampires and delves into what a dark curse vampirism really can be, so all you ""Twilight"" and ""Vampire Diaries"" fans beware. This movie shows you why you DON'T want to become one of the ""undead"".These independent films don't have the flashy multi-million dollar special effects budgets that the big Hollywood mega-films do, and neither does this one, and that's a blessing, because it's what makes this film deliver so well. It's the ACTING and the story being told that carries this film. The cast is a superb chorus of talent, intelligence, and experience. Moretz (Abby), Kodi Smit-McPhee (Owen), and Richard Jenkins absolutely shine in this film.This may be one of the best films I've watched in over 10 years, and if you enjoy the vampire/horror genre, watch it. Even Stephen King said ""'Let Me In' is the best horror film in the last twenty years"".My only beef is one of the deleted scenes included in the Special features called ""Be Me"". If you've ever watched ""Let the Right One In"", this was a scene in the movie that actually came from the book when Eli showed Oskar the brutal way she/he became a vampire. For some reason, this extremely important scene was deleted from ""Let Me In"", because it showed how Abby, like her counterpart Eli in ""Let The Right One In"", used a form of telepathy to rely to Owen how she was turned.Watch this scene after the movie, or include it in where you'll realize it should be during the movie.Also suggested is the original Swedish film ""Let The Right One In"", which is every bit as good as ""Let Me In"", maybe even better because it delves more into the original book's story. I've bought this one from Amazon too and enjoyed it thoroughly as well.The book is also an incredible read, and it very hard to put down.Read more: [...]",5,Best Overall Movie I've Watched in Over 10 years,1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,2569,"['Let', 'Me', '.The', 'title', 'shudder', 'up', 'spine.Based', 'novel', 'Swedish', 'author', 'John', 'Lindquist', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'vampire', 'genre', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Stephen', 'King', 'vampire', 'masterpiece', 'Salem', 'Lot', '.An', 'independent', 'film', 'powerful', 'cast', 'including', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'star', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'based', '1983', 'story', '12', 'year', 'old', 'Owen', 'who', 'brutally', 'bullied', 'school', 'divorced', 'parents', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'desperately', 'seeking', 'identity', 'soon', 'befriended', 'new', '12', 'year', 'old', 'neighbor', ""'Abby"", 'Moretz', 'girl', 'dark', 'secret', 'Let', 'Me', 'love', 'story', 'redemption', 'story', 'tragedy', 'vampire', 'movie', 'rolled', 'one', 'course', 'polar', 'opposite', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'flash', 'glamour', 'portrayal', 'vampires', 'what', 'dark', 'curse', 'vampirism', 'really', 'can', 'be', 'all', 'Twilight', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'fans', 'beware', 'movie', 'why', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'want', 'become', 'one', 'undead', '.These', 'independent', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'flashy', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'special', 'effects', 'budgets', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'mega-films', 'do', 'neither', 'one', 'blessing', 'what', 'film', 'deliver', 'so', 'well', 'ACTING', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'film', 'cast', 'superb', 'chorus', 'talent', 'intelligence', 'experience', 'Moretz', 'Abby', 'Kodi', 'Smit-McPhee', 'Owen', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'absolutely', 'shine', 'film.This', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'watched', '10', 'years', 'enjoy', 'vampire/horror', 'genre', 'watch', 'Even', 'Stephen', 'King', 'said', ""'Let"", 'Me', 'best', 'horror', 'film', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'only', 'beef', 'one', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'included', 'Special', 'features', 'called', 'Be', 'Me', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'was', 'scene', 'movie', 'actually', 'came', 'book', 'when', 'Eli', 'showed', 'Oskar', 'brutal', 'way', 'she/he', 'became', 'vampire', 'reason', 'extremely', 'important', 'scene', 'was', 'deleted', 'Let', 'Me', 'showed', 'how', 'Abby', 'counterpart', 'Eli', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'used', 'form', 'telepathy', 'rely', 'Owen', 'how', 'was', 'turned.Watch', 'scene', 'movie', 'include', 'where', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'should', 'be', 'movie.Also', 'suggested', 'original', 'Swedish', 'film', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'Let', 'Me', 'maybe', 'even', 'better', 'more', 'original', 'book', 'story', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'one', 'Amazon', 'too', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly', 'well.The', 'book', 'also', 'incredible', 'read', 'very', 'hard', 'put', 'down.Read', 'more', '[', ']']",N/A

He is bullied and not really seen by his parents, leading him to dream of other things. Amongst those dreams is something dark and hard, allowing him to see himself sticking a knife into those who pick on him. He also looks out his window and sees other people and there he envisions himself with another role. This play and this want leads him to see a 12 year old girl named Abby, whom he seems to like right away. Never mind the fact that she smeels different and never mind the fact that she doesn't wear shoes in the winter or know what a rubix cube is. she is something that he desires and that sees him as someone. She smiles after a time and she gives him advice, telling him to hit those who hit him harder than he dares. Still, she also says she cannot be his friend because she is not a she at all.what does all this mean? Is Owen finding love or another dark hole? The questions and the answers are what makes Let Me In so good and then some.When it comes to Let Me In, the book and the foreign release are already in the books. They are good, too, adn they have a lot to bank on. Still, this release adds more, and makes its own remarks. Whether it is on the man that Abby lives with or the way things transpire with the acid and the man, it all takes its own shape. Even if you have seen it you will see more, and the more is great. The hospital, for example, shows you more of Abby and the first attack shows you more as well. you also have a new way of ""collecting,"" and a new presentation.It all changes.I personally thought this was good and that it was its own thing. It had its own comments and its own style, making it make its own way forward. From the special effects window to the way the people are seen, there are changes and there are staples that are either needed and stay or that are played with and go. The people that live across from here are changed and yet they are still there, and these things are good and they leave other ways to see. I also like the way everything rounds to a close, with it changing and yet keeping things open, allowing it to be more. I like this as well, and I like the way that it is all seen. It makes a great dynamic and a horror movie, playing to all those invovled. It really deseves a watch.I admit I was afraid of this at first. I learned quickly, however, and this was good.

If you want to see one of the greatest Dark Urban Fantasy/Horror films ever made, rent the original and watch it with subtitles -- outstanding film.  ""Let Me In"" was a very good attempt at a remake, but the wooden acting of two unlikeable characters -- the ""father"" and the ""detective"" -- detracted from the film quite a bit.  Also gotta mention a glaring technical error regarding the detective character: after he kicks in an apartment door without a warrant he proceeds to clear the rooms with his pistol, a Colt 1911A1.  The 1911 is one of the most popular pistol platforms in the United States, and it is a single action automatic which requires the external hammer to be cocked before it will be capable of firing, and they are typically carried ""cocked and locked"" as they have both a thumb safety and a grip safety, allowing it to be carried safely let enabling it to be drawn and fired very quickly and accurately.  This is practically common knowledge amongst anyone with a basic level of experience with firearms.  You would think that at least one technical advisor would've noted the fact that the detective's 1911 was not cocked and thereby incapable of being fired as he cleared the apartment.  Not deducting a point for that, even though it irritated me.This remake was surprisingly good considering all the negative reviews.  Sure, not as great as the original, but face reality folks -- the average American doesn't like foreign films and especially doesn't like reading subtitles, so if it wasn't for this retelling many folks would miss out on this great movie and it might fade to obscurity.  Those who like it might be compelled to seek out the original, and I encourage them to do so.  Like I said before, screenplays are virtually identical and the differences are few.  Acting was not as bad as some reviewers would have you believe.

He befriends a new girl named Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz in a marvelous performance)who is a vampire and while Owen suspects something is off with the girl he bonds with her immediately inspite of the hositility of her ""father"" (Richard Jenkins of ""The Visitor"" and ""Six Feet Under"" fame). There's not a huge deviation in the basic plot but the interpretation and portrayal of the characters brings a different element to the story.Perfectly cast, ""Let Me In"" captures the odd vibe of the original film while adding its own textures. Director Matt Reeves in adapting the novel and original screenplay turns the story some what on its head by telling it in flashback form. Set during the certainty of the Reagan presidency in the 1980's, ""Let Me In"" also nicely captures the atmosphere of innocence and cynicism that existed pre-9/11.""Let Me In"" is a nice return to form of former horror stalwart Hammer Films. For those folks NOT familiar with Hammer, the original studio produced a series of horror classics but then drifted into cheap, unimaginative sequels that sullied their name.""Let Me In"" receives a marvelously creepy looking home video transfer. Where the image is soft it was an intentional choice and, for the most part, the images are crystal clear and sharp as a vampire's tooth.There are also some really cool extras for fans who like those sort of things including a commentary by director Reeves who doesn't shy away from discussing the marvelous original film. Reeves discusses differences between the two films including scenes he included from the original novel that didn't appear in the original Swedish filmLet the Right One In [Blu-ray].We get a number of very good featurettes including a making-of, visual effects and car crash sequence featurette that give us plenty of behind-the-scenes info. We also get a picture-in-picture ""dissection"" of the movie including footage exclusive to this feature as well as some recycled footage from other featurettes. We also get deleted scenes including the scene that played on the internet and was in some trailers of Abby being turned into a vampire. This last deleted scene is presented in HD but most are in SD.The Swedish original is a marvelously creepy mixture of character study and horror film. Although the remake is less subtle in some ways than the original film, director Matt Reeves (""Cloverfield"") expands on the characters in some unique and subtle ways missing from the original film as well.

1340046,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B003EYVXUU,Z Hayes,"[6, 8]","""Let Me In"" is the Hollywood remake of ""Let the Right One In"", a lyrical Swedish movie that explores myriad themes - friendship, first love, bullying, adolescence, and vampirism. One might think there are too many themes to be handled in one movie, but both the original film and remake managed to handle these multiple themes in a credible manner.The remake is not exactly faithful to the original, and viewers who have watched both will notice the differences such as the opening scene, the changes in characterization for some of the minor characters, etc. For the most part though, the remake focuses on the essential parts of the story just as in the original and makes for riveting viewing. This is not the movie to watch if you're looking for pretty vampires smooching around, or a splatterfest with non-stop action. There's hints of a romance, slowly simmering, a mixture of Gothic and sweet teenage love, and there's also lots of blood, but by no means does this movie careen along - it takes its time developing the characters, drawing viewers into this strange, dark world where nothing is at it appears, and focuses viewers' attention on the two main characters.The story is of teenager Owen [Kodi Smit-McPhee] who is a victim of bullying by a group of classmates. Owen doesn't fight back, instead he thinks up ways of avenging himself whilst roaming about his apartment complex during the winter with copious amounts of snow all over. Whilst out on his nightly jaunt, Owen meets a strange girl named Abby [Chloe Moretz] who tells him straight off that she can't be his friend. Abby has just moved into the apartment next door to Owen's with a man Owen thinks is her dad. Despite Abby's words, the pair are drawn to each other, and form a real friendship. For a while at least, Owen remains blissfully unaware of the dark secret hidden by Abby and her `dad'.""Let Me In"" is as much a coming-of-age tale as it is a vampire tale - both threads are credibly woven into the story, and neither one detracts from the other. The coming-of-age part is ably pulled off by the two leads - young Owen and Abby manouver around the awkwardness of male-female relationships with a sweetness that I have not seen on screen for a long time, and both take turns in playing the 'stronger' role. The vampire thread is also credibly woven in - yes, there are the compulsory gore scenes that go with the territory, but never in an over the top manner. Even the effects are rather muted, making them all the more credible. The cinematography of the snow-covered landscape does much to add to the stark atmosphere and to enhance the desperate sense of isolation that goes with being a vampire. Abby is a young-looking  yet old soul trapped within the confines of immortality, and the necessary brutality that comes with it. The viewer struggles between revulsion and compassion for this lonely vampire.""Let Me In' doesn't exactly conform to any particular genre - part adolescent drama, part vampire/horror/suspense, it is nevertheless a compelling watch and a must-see. The film is rated R, with Spanish subtitles, and English subtitles for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired. The film is in color, and the running time is 115 minutes.
