Understated, and not always deliberately.""The film oscillates between a cross-cultural journey,""  Yep""an emotional drama,""  Not so much""and a haunting love story""  Kinda dumb love story, actually""while director Sue Brooks catches her audience off guard as she takes us down an unexpected route.""  Most definitelySo why am I giving it only 3 stars?  Well, that's a whole lot easier to explain than why it won 8 Australian Film Institute Awards.  It's an okay little movie, not all that.We begin with a well-grounded little group of characters in Australia and throw in this silent Japanese guy.  You could argue it's a Toni Collette showpiece or you could argue it's a great ensemble cast, and either way you'd be correct.  The interactions are played very well, understated, mercifully free of stereotyping, well thought out, and wholly consistent with what I've seen living in Asia since 1999.  It's realistic, it's well-written, it's clever, it has subtle humor, and the acting is top-notch.Then comes a romance which is, I'm sorry to say, much too predictable.  If someone made a movie where the cross-cultural romance didn't happen, THAT would be unpredictable.  A few stereotypes creep in here, which we'll call ""lazy writing"" and just move on.Then the unexpected direction.  Oh yeah, eventually the film throws one hell of a curve ball our way.  It could happen, it can happen, and sometimes it does happen, but you don't expect it in this film.  Nice one!After that, well, it seems to lose its way.  My wife, who is Australian, thought it was an attempt at humor that misfired.  I don't agree.  I think they just had no idea where to go after that unexpected change of direction, almost as if they'd surprised themselves and couldn't recover.  One reviewer thought it lost all momentum after the Land Rover scene, but I think it picked up momentum remarkably well after that, only to lose it here.If you have seen the movie, I could use a metaphor here that would also serve as a plot spoiler, so for those who haven't seen the movie, I won't use the metaphor.  Is that clear as mud?  Good.In the end, it's a 100-minute movie, and we were well past the 60 minute mark before I thought it got lost.  Excellent acting throughout, a lot of fine writing for the most part, and some breathtaking scenery like you wouldn't believe.",3,"Well-intentioned, bit of a misfire",1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,2475,"['cover', 'Collette', 'propelled', 'beautifully', 'understated', 'script', 'digs', 'deep', 'deliver', 'performance', 'career', 'True', 'enough', 'Understated', 'not', 'always', 'deliberately', 'film', 'cross-cultural', 'journey', 'Yep', 'emotional', 'drama', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'haunting', 'love', 'story', 'Kinda', 'dumb', 'love', 'story', 'actually', 'director', 'Sue', 'Brooks', 'audience', 'off', 'guard', 'down', 'unexpected', 'route', 'Most', 'definitelySo', 'why', 'am', 'giving', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'Well', 'whole', 'lot', 'easier', 'explain', 'why', 'won', '8', 'Australian', 'Film', 'Institute', 'Awards', 'okay', 'little', 'movie', 'not', 'that.We', 'begin', 'well-grounded', 'little', 'group', 'characters', 'Australia', 'throw', 'silent', 'Japanese', 'guy', 'could', 'argue', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'showpiece', 'could', 'argue', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'way', ""'d"", 'be', 'correct', 'interactions', 'are', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'understated', 'mercifully', 'free', 'stereotyping', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'wholly', 'consistent', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'living', 'Asia', '1999', 'realistic', 'well-written', 'clever', 'subtle', 'humor', 'acting', 'top-notch.Then', 'romance', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'much', 'too', 'predictable', 'someone', 'made', 'movie', 'where', 'cross-cultural', 'romance', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'THAT', 'would', 'be', 'unpredictable', 'few', 'stereotypes', 'creep', 'here', ""'ll"", 'call', 'lazy', 'writing', 'just', 'move', 'on.Then', 'unexpected', 'direction', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'eventually', 'film', 'one', 'hell', 'curve', 'way', 'could', 'happen', 'can', 'happen', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'film', 'Nice', 'one', 'well', 'lose', 'way', 'My', 'wife', 'who', 'Australian', 'thought', 'was', 'attempt', 'humor', 'misfired', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'think', 'just', 'had', 'idea', 'where', 'go', 'unexpected', 'change', 'direction', 'almost', ""'d"", 'surprised', 'could', ""n't"", 'recover', 'One', 'reviewer', 'thought', 'lost', 'momentum', 'Land', 'Rover', 'scene', 'think', 'picked', 'up', 'momentum', 'remarkably', 'well', 'only', 'lose', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'could', 'use', 'metaphor', 'here', 'would', 'also', 'serve', 'plot', 'spoiler', 'so', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'use', 'metaphor', 'clear', 'mud', 'Good.In', 'end', '100-minute', 'movie', 'were', 'well', '60', 'minute', 'mark', 'thought', 'got', 'lost', 'Excellent', 'acting', 'lot', 'fine', 'writing', 'most', 'part', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', 'would', ""n't"", 'believe']",N/A
809566,A2MO0NUJ76FPG0,B0001L3LUO,"A. H. Lynde ""ahlynde""","[18, 19]","(...). Director Sue Brooks gives us a rare gem of a film about intercultural love against the backdrop of an alternately desolate and lush Australian desert. Sandy (Toni Colette) is a gritty Aussie geologist, attractive and hard, it seems, with little patience to chaperone fresh-off-the plane Tachibana (Gotaro Tsunashima). The young man has arrived from Kyoto to look after his father's mining project.  Sandy sulks at the traditionally Japanese Tachibana's commands.  She's a cog in his eyes and he clearly is the boss in these parts.  Brooks' straightforward direction develops the relationship between these opposites at a realistically uneven pace.Sandy takes Tachibana deeper into the interior.  At one point he marvels from a mountaintop overlooking the vast desert colors and up at the arching silver blue sky.  Clearly, cramped Japan offers nothing like this to him.  He has met his match in Sandy and the rugged land, and new feelings stir within him.  Tachibana revels in meeting obstacles head-on as they plow forward, with his virtual `bushido' determination.  The jeep falls into a quagmire, Sandy wants out, but Tachibana will move heaven, but mostly earth, to get going again, and so they do.  Exhausted, they collapse into sleep in the cold night desert air.  Sandy gently nudges close to him.  Later they make love in a motel, curiously, deeply.  We are left anticipating what direction the story will take.  The next day, everything changes, the silent intimacy is replaced by sheer joy in their love and life - these are two `kids' in love, tender in expression, sitting beside a lush oasis, the river rippling, seeming to call to them.  Tachibana ambiguously says of his wife back in Japan, ""I will make it right"".The rest of the film contains some shocking events which, well, impact all that has gone before.  Late in the film, we see the wistful, knowing eyes of Tachibana's beautiful wife (a memorable cameo by Yumiko Tanaka).  And through her, we understand everything at once, it seems -- about Sandy, Tachibana, and the gut-wrenching depths of cross-cultural love.  This is both a deeply touching and shocking film brought to vivid life by superb character acting and Brooks' restrained direction.",5,"Touching, Shocking Love in Australia",1082332800,"04 19, 2004",2004,2226,"['Director', 'Sue', 'Brooks', 'rare', 'gem', 'film', 'intercultural', 'love', 'backdrop', 'alternately', 'desolate', 'lush', 'Australian', 'desert', 'Sandy', 'Toni', 'Colette', 'gritty', 'Aussie', 'geologist', 'attractive', 'hard', 'little', 'patience', 'chaperone', 'fresh-off-the', 'plane', 'Tachibana', 'Gotaro', 'Tsunashima', 'young', 'man', 'arrived', 'Kyoto', 'look', 'father', 'mining', 'project', 'Sandy', 'sulks', 'traditionally', 'Japanese', 'Tachibana', 'commands', 'cog', 'eyes', 'clearly', 'boss', 'parts', 'Brooks', 'straightforward', 'direction', 'relationship', 'opposites', 'realistically', 'uneven', 'pace.Sandy', 'Tachibana', 'deeper', 'interior', 'one', 'point', 'mountaintop', 'overlooking', 'vast', 'desert', 'colors', 'up', 'arching', 'silver', 'blue', 'sky', 'Clearly', 'cramped', 'Japan', 'nothing', 'met', 'match', 'Sandy', 'rugged', 'land', 'new', 'feelings', 'stir', 'Tachibana', 'revels', 'meeting', 'obstacles', 'head-on', 'plow', 'forward', 'virtual', 'bushido', 'determination', 'jeep', 'quagmire', 'Sandy', 'out', 'Tachibana', 'will', 'move', 'heaven', 'mostly', 'earth', 'get', 'going', 'again', 'so', 'do', 'Exhausted', 'collapse', 'sleep', 'cold', 'night', 'desert', 'air', 'Sandy', 'gently', 'close', 'Later', 'make', 'love', 'motel', 'curiously', 'deeply', 'are', 'left', 'anticipating', 'what', 'direction', 'story', 'will', 'take', 'next', 'day', 'everything', 'changes', 'silent', 'intimacy', 'replaced', 'sheer', 'joy', 'love', 'life', 'are', 'two', 'kids', 'love', 'tender', 'expression', 'sitting', 'lush', 'oasis', 'river', 'rippling', 'seeming', 'call', 'Tachibana', 'ambiguously', 'wife', 'back', 'Japan', 'will', 'make', 'right', '.The', 'rest', 'film', 'shocking', 'events', 'well', 'impact', 'gone', 'before', 'Late', 'film', 'see', 'wistful', 'knowing', 'eyes', 'Tachibana', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'memorable', 'cameo', 'Yumiko', 'Tanaka', 'understand', 'everything', 'once', 'Sandy', 'Tachibana', 'gut-wrenching', 'depths', 'cross-cultural', 'love', 'deeply', 'touching', 'shocking', 'film', 'brought', 'vivid', 'life', 'superb', 'character', 'acting', 'Brooks', 'restrained', 'direction']",N/A

809568,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0001L3LUO,Andy Orrock,"[5, 8]","""Japanese Story"" swept the Australian version of the Oscars for films released in 2003, claiming eight awards.  It's easy to see why.  First, there's Toni Collette, recently horribly under-used in Nia Vardalos' ""Connie and Carla.""  She's Australia's top actress and proves it here in spades.  I'll watch anything with Toni Collette.  End of story.  Go see ""About a Boy"" and ""Muriel's Wedding"" (among others) if you question why.I get a kick out of some of these other posts here about the ""boringness"" of this movie, or about Gotaro Tsunashima's Hiro not talking, etc.  What's going on here is scriptwriter Alison Tilson and Director Sue Brooks showing you two intensely different cultures and bringing them to a jarring (and how) intersection.  Hiro doesn't talk a lot because:a) When he arrives, he's the prototypical Japanese Salaryman, a bit beaten down by life.b) He's taken aback (culturally) by the presence of a ""woman driver.""c) There's some unspoken, intense stress in his life right now (this is noted subtly in many ways, including his clipped phone calls back to ""Mr. Suzuki"" in the office).d) He is adapting to the wide-open emptiness of Australia (compared to the crush of urban Japan).Tilson and Brooks depict all this tension in a sparse, almost Zen-like fashion.  As a result, we get wonderous swatches of dialogue that almost read like Haiku, such as when Hiro describes the meaning of ""Hai"" to Collette's Sandy:""Hai"" means ""I am listening.""""Go on. Yes.""""HAI?"" means ""What? I don't know.""Sometimes, it means ""No.""But nobody ever says ""No.""That, friends, is both elegant beauty in a script and a true look inside the Japanese character.

809575,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0001L3LUO,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 6]","I like Toni Collette. With her toothy grin, feline eyes and wide-open manner, she steals scenes in others' movies with ease. This time she is center stage and quite wonderful as Sandy Edwards, a tough-acting Australian geologist who must chauffeur a prospective client, the son of a rich Japanese industrialist, deep into the Pilbara region of Western Australia. As she proves with a couple of key scenes here, she is an actor who can express fear and emotional pain with a vanity-free, visceral ferocity that is almost frightening to witness for the nakedness of her expression. I just wish this 2003 movie was worth her effort. Director Sue Brooks and screenwriter Alison Tilson have fashioned a cross-cultural love story/road movie that seems to be grasping at something stylistically minimalist and emotionally resonant. It seems to be the inverse of ""Crocodile Dundee"" with a pinch of Nicolas Roeg's ""Walkabout"" in the desert sequence and a heavy dollop of Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" in the relationship department. However, the filmmakers fall short in integrating the plot elements into something powerful, and the one surprising twist in the storyline doesn't really help set the movie on the right path.Having just seen a couple of Yasujiro Ozu's minimalist masterworks from the 1950's, ""Tokyo Story"" and ""Early Summer"", I can tell what Brooks and Tilson are trying to do here, and that is present a story of self-discovery that evolves not by defining moments but by mood and insinuation. Unfortunately, whereas Ozu could do this with dexterity and unexpected emotive force, ""Japanese Story"" just seems cryptic and lugubrious, especially in the anticlimactic last half-hour which seems endless. The movie is also burdened by the seemingly deliberate overuse of cultural stereotypes, for example, Tachibana Hiromitsu, the young Japanese executive, is sexist and patronizing, gets drunk in a karaoke bar, speaks little English (or makes little attempt at the beginning), and becomes too embarrassed to call for help when a dire situation arises. Sandy is frankly no more flattering a portrait of an Australian, as she is brusque, short-tempered and without etiquette. It becomes clear the initial set-up of a software sale has been jettisoned in favor of the plot contrivance of putting them together. They, of course, become attracted to each other, but there is no credible explanation for this development because the emotional and physical attraction seems more symbolic than anything else, especially in an odd scene where her more masculine frame towers over his seemingly more fragile body.Gotaro Tsunashima plays Hiromitsu for what the role is worth, which isn't much in the script since he is designed to be a cipher for much of the story. Nobody else makes much of an impression here, though I have to admit I was put off by the way his wife is portrayed so predictably and embodied by a stoic china-doll actress named Yumiko Tanaka. I also can't believe the film uses the hoary device of a voiceover letter at the end, and Elizabeth Drake's repetitive, Asian-twanged music score becomes more irritating by the second.

Toni Colette is charming and completely believable as an independent, no-nonsense Australian geologist.  In a refreshing twist, the actor who plays her Japanese businessman lover is the physically beautiful one of the pair, and the camera makes the most of his physical attributes.  The story unfolds with subtlety and humor, yet is ultimately shocking.  Without giving too much away, I can only say that there is an abrupt shift in plot and mood that occurs midway through the story, and that despite some continuity of sub-themes, this divides the film drastically into two segments.  Certainly life can and does take these unexpected directions, yet the sudden transition (particularly in a story this narrow in scope) feels a touch contrived.

Why this extraordinary work didn't garner more publicity and attention in this country is unexplainable, but perhaps now that this rather unique and intimate story can be viewed on DVD it may hopefully  gain the access into the hearts and minds of the general populace it so very much deserves.Australia.  Geologists.  Contemporary political and economic push pulls between overpopulated and commerced Japan and the vast emptiness and opportunity of the Australian outback.  These topics do not seem to contain a fragile story, but that is exactly what these ingredients serve us.  Sandy (Toni Collette in yet another superlative performance, this one clearly her breakthrough role that establishes her as one of today's most important actors) is a bored, frank, coarse geologist who is asked by her boss Baird (Matthew Dyktynski) to serve as 'tour guide' for a visiting Japanese businessman whose company's interest in Baird's abilities could be the important step in his future.  Sandy balks but submits and meets the very rigid Tachibana Hiromitsu (Gotaro Tsunashima) and off they go to visit not just the lands represented by the company for whom Sandy works, but also the Pilbara Desert at the insistence of Hiro.  There is a complex and entertaining struggle of wills which culminates in an impossibly awful 'bogging down' of their vehicle in the sands of the desert.  In the middle of nowhere the essentials of surviving - and relating - create a chemistry that beautifully and subtlety bonds the two.  Each gives the other the gift of an Open Heart.  The remainder of the journey includes a pitch perfect climax and it is the management of this change that reveals the strength of that formed relationship.  What has been a delicately humorous movie becomes a moving story about need, trust, and coping.  Director Sue Brooks brings out the very best in all her actors and has elected a cinematographer to survey Australia as beautifully as any movie in memory.

Even with the sound off, the delectable crimsons, ebonies and golds of the desert make viewing the movie worthwhile.Geologist Sandy Edwards somehow draws the job of showing Tachibana Hiromitsu, son of a Japanese mining magnate, around Australia. Sandy is as loudmouthed and assertive as Hiromitsu is guarded and proper. Some of the film's visual humor involves the comparison of Sandy in midriff-revealing tops, and desert-rat boots exploring the desert with Hiro in black dress pants and button-down shirts. The pair get into assorted scrapes and arguments as they travel the desert -- in search of what, we are never sure. But while this looks like the classic clich&eacute; movie showing the pairing (and inevitable attraction) of extreme opposites, the film has a few surprises up its sleeves. The first half of the film is rather predictable, but after a crisis point, the characters find themselves on unfamiliar terrain, attempting to find their way on the shifting sands of cultural differences and decisions on how much truth is safe and proper to express. Hiro has attachments back home, and by the movie's end, we are confronted with the feelings of guilt, remorse and fidelity.

And my own personal favorite in the London Underground, ""Mind the Gap"".Sandy (Toni Collette), a geologist employed by an Australian mining company, is handed the task nobody else wants - to nursemaid a young man, Tachibana (Gotaro Tsunashima), visiting from Japan. Tachibana's Old Man owns a big chunk of the company, so be a good sport and show him around, OK?The Most Honored Guest arrives, and, for Sandy at least, it's extreme dislike at first sight. While unfailingly polite (bow), Tachibana is very reserved (bow), apparently speaks little English (bow), and mentally assigns Sandy a subservient (female) role as his driver (bow). One evening, he gets falling-down drunk with The Guys, and Sandy must scrape him off the pavement and lug him back to his room. Are we having fun yet?Tachibana is so impressed during his visit to an enormous open pit mine that he demands to be driven deeper into the Outback to see the source of a particularly rich ore. Sandy desists, but, to her exasperation, is overruled. On the way along a treacherous and lonely road of sand, their SUV becomes mired. After much difficulty, and a cold night sleeping in the bush, the two manage to extricate the vehicle and return to ""civilization"". By then, shared hardship has changed their relationship 180 degrees.Tsunashima's role remains to the audience relatively inscrutable. Tachibana serves as Sandy's emotional crucible. Indeed, this is Toni Collette's one-woman show much as MONSTER belonged to Charlize Theron. Though the latter was the undisputed winner of the Best Actress Oscar, I'm a little annoyed that Toni wasn't even nominated. As the plot unfolds, Sandy experiences a rollercoaster ride of emotions. By the film's conclusion, her emotional trauma verges on shell-shock, and the final scene on the lakeshore compares in power to the emotional catharsis of Theron's Wuornos character in the immediate aftermath of her first murder in MONSTER.JAPANESE STORY conveys the message that life can be shockingly arbitrary, and the manner by which one copes is culturally determined to a large degree. This was poignantly and beautifully depicted by Sandy's meeting with Tachibana's wife.This film, at 4.5 stars, is perhaps Collette's best screen outing to date, and is an indication of the even greater performances of which she's capable if given the opportunity.",5,Mind the gap!,1088380800,"06 28, 2004",2004,2579,"['prudent', 'take', 'heed', 'posted', 'warning', 'signs', 'Caution', 'Radiation', 'Icy', 'Bridge', 'Jet', 'Intake', 'No', 'Diving', 'Beware', 'Dog', 'Watch', 'Downhill', 'Speed', 'C', 'grade', 'posted', 'eateries', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'County', 'Health', 'Department', 'own', 'personal', 'favorite', 'London', 'Underground', 'Gap', '.Sandy', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'geologist', 'employed', 'Australian', 'mining', 'company', 'handed', 'task', 'nobody', 'else', 'nursemaid', 'young', 'man', 'Tachibana', 'Gotaro', 'Tsunashima', 'visiting', 'Japan', 'Tachibana', 'Old', 'Man', 'big', 'chunk', 'company', 'so', 'be', 'good', 'sport', 'show', 'around', 'OK', 'Most', 'Honored', 'Guest', 'Sandy', 'least', 'extreme', 'dislike', 'first', 'sight', 'unfailingly', 'polite', 'bow', 'Tachibana', 'very', 'reserved', 'bow', 'apparently', 'little', 'English', 'bow', 'mentally', 'assigns', 'Sandy', 'subservient', 'female', 'role', 'driver', 'bow', 'One', 'evening', 'falling-down', 'drunk', 'Guys', 'Sandy', 'must', 'scrape', 'off', 'pavement', 'lug', 'back', 'room', 'Are', 'having', 'fun', 'yet', 'Tachibana', 'so', 'impressed', 'visit', 'enormous', 'open', 'pit', 'mine', 'be', 'driven', 'deeper', 'Outback', 'see', 'source', 'particularly', 'rich', 'ore.', 'Sandy', 'desists', 'exasperation', 'overruled', 'way', 'treacherous', 'lonely', 'road', 'sand', 'SUV', 'mired', 'much', 'difficulty', 'cold', 'night', 'sleeping', 'bush', 'two', 'manage', 'extricate', 'vehicle', 'return', 'civilization', 'then', 'shared', 'hardship', 'changed', 'relationship', '180', 'degrees.Tsunashima', 'role', 'audience', 'relatively', 'inscrutable', 'Tachibana', 'Sandy', 'emotional', 'crucible', 'Indeed', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'one-woman', 'show', 'much', 'MONSTER', 'belonged', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'latter', 'was', 'undisputed', 'winner', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', ""'m"", 'little', 'annoyed', 'Toni', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'nominated', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'Sandy', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'emotions', 'film', 'conclusion', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'verges', 'shell-shock', 'final', 'scene', 'lakeshore', 'power', 'emotional', 'catharsis', 'Theron', 'Wuornos', 'character', 'immediate', 'aftermath', 'first', 'murder', 'MONSTER.JAPANESE', 'STORY', 'conveys', 'message', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'shockingly', 'arbitrary', 'manner', 'one', 'copes', 'culturally', 'determined', 'large', 'degree', 'was', 'poignantly', 'beautifully', 'depicted', 'Sandy', 'meeting', 'Tachibana', 'wife.This', 'film', '4.5', 'stars', 'perhaps', 'Collette', 'best', 'screen', 'outing', 'date', 'indication', 'even', 'greater', 'performances', 'capable', 'given', 'opportunity']",N/A

What happened? Is this the same nation that gave us gems such as ""Priscilla"" and ""The Delinquents""? I don't quite comprehend the reason behind their decision to promote this film internationally - I mean, it has nothing.To be blunt, the story revolves around Toni and the Japanese guy on a road trip. They do it for business, but on the way fall in lust, and have sex repeatedly, even after Toni discovers he has a wife and kids back home. There is a particularly agonizing scene where they try to get their car out of the sand its stuck in. Not good. Then there is the prolonged bedroom scene where both actors looking stoned out of their brains attempt to ""kink"" things up a little bit. I was left wanting them to fall asleep immediately instead. Terrible.Then the shock element is introduced, and the Japanese dude dies while attempting a really girly jump into a pool (should be seen to be believed). Once he dies, the especially horrendous second half of the movie sees us observing Toni Colette cry in a multitude of ways - Toni crying while sitting, Toni crying by the window, Toni crying during meetings, Toni crying at the airport, Toni crying at the funeral. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out where this is going. You got it. Nowhere.Then the Japanese wife comes to collect the body and through a series of idiotic circumstances finds out that her husband has been bonking Toni. However, all Japanese people are presented as the most gracious creatures to ever walk the planet, and she forgives even this. The final scene where Toni and the wife see each other off is as bad as everything before it. The actress playing the wife seems desperate to be left out of the movie, and Toni is busy crying anyway, so who really cares.All in all, this is one sick package of the most abysmal movie making ever witnessed to come out of Australia. And someone should really tell Toni Colette not to remove her clothes on camera. No disrespect, but she just shouldn't. This entire film was boring, weak, and if anyone calls this an offbeat art film, they are way off the mark. At the best, this is a monumental mistake that should never be watched.Do NOT be fooled by the pretty cover.

No matter that she is reluctant to participate and completely ignorant of the male-dominated, ritualistic business protocols practiced by the Japanese, she ultimately manages to overcome her many (unintentional) slights and insults to fall inexplicably in love with her charge, The World's Least Interesting Man, Tachibana-san - played with mordant sterility by Gotaro Tsunashima. I am almost certain that businesses worldwide have industrial robots from Japan with more charm than this stiff.One minute the opposites-attract leads are spitting fire at each other, the next they're horizontal. No development or justification, it just happens - not withstanding the surprise revelation that he's married (and she's betrayed) their relationship hardly misses a beat.The conceit of the story is Tachibana's sudden death that not only short-circuits their impossible love but sends Collette's Sandy careening into a recrimination-soaked sleep walk for the remainder of the film that reminded me more of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead than anything approaching inconsolable, believable grief. I just hate it when bad scripts happen to great actors - Collette certainly deserved better.

809589,A1E15WYG9C47X1,B0001L3LUO,"""mobby_uk""","[19, 20]","Japanese Story is a good film, let me be clear about that.It might not be the masterpiece that the Australian Film Board Awards (the equivalent of the Oscars and Baftas) thought it is, winning a lot of nominations, but it is nevertheless a well acted and directed film.A love story with a twist between an Australian geologist played to perfection by Toni Collette (and a well deserved award for her role) and a Japanese business man, played by Gotaro Tsunashima in his first feature role, the film does offer a fresh treatment of the cross cultural romantic encounters that I thought very few films approached.Without spoiling the twist in the film, I very much believe that Japanese Story has been misunderstood and its points missed on many,and hence my desire to write this review.A business road trip with two very unlikely characters from two different worlds, leads rather maybe predictably to a connection that is strengthened after a night lost and spent in the vastness of the Australian desert.Many reviewers have thought that this romance was rather very quick and not quite believable, but I think differently..In real life, there are countless examples of instant infatuations' or 'love at first sight' and while this is not the case with our two leads, it somehow makes sense that the sharing of hardships between them , the subdued humor of Gotaro, the loneliness and increased interest of Colette might very well have led to love.(A rather distant example can be made with the romance of Dr Zhivago and Lara, when they were thrown by circumstances together, irrespective of the established lives they had outside their relationship)The sad and unexpected ending where Colette shows her finest acting to date, is touching, because she realized how much she cared for him after the incident..as if he has revived feelings she tried to hide or did not take seriously, until too late.So in that respect the film works beautifully..Although some of the conversations between the two were rather weak, it is the whole atmosphere of the film, the beauty of the vast and empty spaces,and the bonding of two people in unconventional and potentially dangerous situation, that I found was well done in the film..There are some love scenes as well, one of which I found surprisingly very erotic and tastefully done.Japanese Story is a quite, sweet and sad little film that soothes the eyes,and moves with its fine acting and competent direction.

I love Collette too, from ""Cosi"", ""Muriel's Wedding""...Real-life issues are forcefully grounded in Shockingly beautiful nature photography.  You are forced, through use of Shock, to confront the gritty essences of life in the ""real world"" involving the elementals of earth, sand, sky, and water.  The movie's car is the ""Car-ride of Life"", a vessel that both transports us through life, distances us from experiencing the world, and speeds us tooo fast towards our fate.  Quite often we are so removed from the realities of our life by our obsessions, worries, cultural hangups, earning money---even our buildings and societies keep us from experiencing life.  Even death is not experienced, as the sick, dying and dead are isolated from the us.In this car-ride, you have the reconnections with the real experiences of life: in-the-moment experiences of living, emotional connections, sometimes inexplicable love/sex connections, and end-of-life realities.""Country-girl"" and ""City-boy"" meet, hate each other, they both view each other as rude & vulgar, are forced into days of intense one-on-one...eventually the curiousity & internal lonliness heats up..  They've picked the most extreme ""city-boy"" you can find, a ""Japanese Salaryman"".(NOTE: My own significant-other, foreign-raised, would rather risk an accident than ""go"" in the woods, seeing this in the film was funny.  Also familiar, the fears of looking foolish, trying new things, and tripping on intense internal pressures & absentee workaholic fathers.  Also, dangerous lack of skills/commonsense outside the study/work realm.)Anyway, these two are examples of being too isolated in their own little worlds, they lack ""street-smarts"" for the whole of human existence.  His lack of practical knowlege gets them in trouble with terrible consequences, and her lack of social skills hurts her, especially Japanese business manners.  He is very isolated/isolating from everything, prissy, using his camera to shield himself, immature, using Daddy's name to jerk people around instead of learning to use his own power.  Her negativity, anger & bitterness are her isolation tools.The sandbog scene shows his fear of imperfection & embarrassment, him secretely disabling his cellphone  preventing her from calling for help.  He got them into the mess, too embarrassed to let anybody find out, he's desperate to fix it himself---so he read the BOOK.  I think she could've got them out, but would rather have called to make absolutely sure they got out.  He had no real concept of how deadly a situation they were in, being far out in the middle of a desert & not prepared.I'm not sure about the chemistry between these two, there wasn't any warm leadup to the initial hookup, except the stealth-eyeballing each other.  But then, are only logical hookups allowed in life?  The camera-work treats him more as a woman, he's hairless, no muscles, and very pretty.  He's really prissy, distastful of manual labor, dirt--you can see it with his body language.The actual initial hookup was kinda icky/creepy, he laid there like a plastic doll, or rather like two plastic dolls investigating each other.  (And trust me, you cannot do it with pants on, the zipper will slice-&-dice.  Also, certain folks are soo prissy, they'd never let you do that to their biz-clothes unless they could run it through the cleaners TWICE.  Worse than Seinfeld!  Unless he asked her to do it..)As they spend more time together, they become more honest, better communicators, more trusting, less defensive.  He starts to look less like a plastic prissy-doll, more relaxed, happy, more willing to throw away the road maps.  The hookups more human, he's taking more active roles.  She is gentler, more open to enjoyment, but kinda ignoring how she'll feel when he'll go back to wifey.  Both are kinda naive that it's not going to hurt when he goes back.  This trip is probably the most unusual thing either has ever done, they've never looked more alive.Then poof, the car-ride is over way too soon, as it usually does, and she has to deal with something she's never had any experience dealing with.  Neither have her coworkers, they can't relate.  The loss is 100-times worse than she obviously expected.  Her guilt keeps her from making any final goodbyes--if she hadn't boinked, she would've felt fine about making the final goodbye or dealings with the wife.But then, if you could read the future, what would you have done on the trip?  I think they did perfect. It's devastating, and Collette does a fabulous job.  In the end, you see that Sandy has come to understand the scrapbook and it's standing testiment for others that have gone away.NOTE: Of course, the ""Bang-it because life is short"" idea should be weighed against losing 50% of marital assets & child support.NOTE: Japanese Muzak:  what is with the same horribly bad muzak song playing at ""important"" moments?

Before and after that event, the movie is really boring.One stereotype I was willing to go along with was when the Japanese man said the Australian woman had a big ass until I saw his Japanese wife's ass, which could rival that of the biggest butted women anywhere. Even a self respecting hoodlum rapper would have found the junk in the trunk of the wife to almost meet his standards. Compared to the Japanese actress, the Aussie actress is a slender little filly. You don't see too many Japanese women as fat as the pudgy wife outside Hawaii where many Okinawans who came in the diasporo have interbred with the native Hawaiians.The music score was hideous. Firstly, it did not fit the Japan they were trying to portray through the businessman. The Japanese man was supposed to be a mainland Japanese from a big city. The music selected was Okinawan. Those two parts of Japan have as much in common as New York City does with Hawaii. It would be like making a movie about a New York executive and trying to capture the spirit of East coast business culture by playing Hawaiian luau music. Okinawan culture is not traditional Japanese culture. Not at all. Okinawans even look different than the general Japanese if you just consider prototypes.I also did not understand the Aussie woman putting on the Japanese man's pants. The motel scene was already awkward and sort of icky. That just made it even more awkward and weird. When she put them on, I thought, oh, yuck, his cajones have been sweating in those same pants for days in the Australian outback. Ick. Then they did it while she wore his sweaty sack pants. Then the next morning he was wearing them and I thought, oh, worse, now those pants have several days of his jock itch fungus sweat and their combined personal nasty all combined together in one really dirty pair of pants. The whole physical interaction between those two was as appealing as watching an 80 year old woman get personal with a barn animal but really far less interesting.

Maybe it's that the film is, essentially, two films that divide at the second act midpoint. In the first part, the film is about a rather typical Australian woman, self-possessed, macho, brusque and unabashed. She is a geologist who wants to sell her software to a Japanese businessman who is there to see an iron ore operation that his family partly owns. The woman, played by the changeling genius Toni Collette, drives the Japanese businessman (Gotaro Tsunashima) into the outback to survey the mines. They get stuck out in a very bad spot in the desert and ultimately, by working together, manage to get themselves free. It has been a life and death situation, and the exhilaration of the success makes them both giddy.Collette, a rough-handed Aussie gal, is quite curious and even intoxicated by this very handsome and exquisitely delicate man, so foreign to her. They begin an affair. Then midway through, there is a drastic event that changes everything. The rest of the film is devoted to the aftermath of this event.This movie moves slowly, too slowly for some. And there seem to be some rather wild swings in Collette's character and some huge lapses (a real Australian would never go into the outback without a second car in the group, satellite phone, etc). But I bought into Collette's character's strange arc. Maybe it's her extraordinary talent that worked for me, I don't know, but the film packed a strong emotional wallop for me. I had my doubts when the car got stuck because it's just so absurd that any experienced Aussie would ever get into that situation, but I let it go.

809593,A19S3JSCAIWS26,B0001L3LUO,ohmysohopeless,"[4, 5]","I must have been so out of choices to watch a film featuring yet another boring Japanese businessman and how funny he appears through the glasses of Western culture; this was my first assumption, hopefully to be betrayed.  In the beginning of the movie I was kind of pissed that the film totally followed my expectation and portrayed the poor Japanese guy as someone so boring and out of synch with the situation.  I find a bit disturbing that such a stereotype is so prevalent that it is almost assumed that the audience does share the same view on a typical Japanese guy in business suits (otherwise how would we assume he so needed to be liberated).Of course this is not an 80s movie, so it is not that the movie is trying to promote the stereotype for the sheer enjoyment.  But the issue that I kept maintaining as the story went (a man and a woman put together in uninhabited places --- what else can you expect) us the fact that it is not clear at all to me how Sandy could find a connection to Hiromitsu.  I guess the concept of polar opposite personalities finding connections would have been interesting, but it seemed to me that Sandy's emotional transition wasn't clearly elaborated.Another issue is with the music.  The vocal tracks used in the soundtrack are music of Okinawa, not the prototypical Japanese traditional songs.  Okay, they still sound beautiful and who cares, but for someone who actually can hear the difference, I did not get the connection if the movie somehow wanted to sound Japanese.  If anything, Hiromitsu should've just gone to Okinawa and find polar opposite of modern Japan driven by the corporate giants.  That might have erased some of the rather sad stereotypical assumptions that you have to maintain about the Japanese businessman to enjoy the movie.  Though that would not have sold to the Western audience.Overall, I didn't really enjoy the movie except Collette's acting, which is very mature.

The PROBLEM with this is, instead of knocking the wind out of you with profound messages or some kind of punch-line at the end of the movie, this movie has more the effect of giving you one great, whopping head-ache, leaving you just barely awake and sane enough to feel the pain.  I like Toni Collette as a rule, she was brilliant in &quot;About A Boy&quot;, but this movie falls out of the 'romance movie with a point' category and into the 'dismally boring, depressing, and drawn out' column.With that said, there is one good thing about this movie.  The first half of the film has a pleasantly cute, atmospheric romantic comedy with a unique atmosphere.  Again, however, even during this charming little sequence of the movie, you run constantly into pot-holes of long, boring scenes with seemingly no purpose.  Oh, don't worry though, it get's better!  Right when you think things are picking up (with both the characters and the plot-line) the train-of-thought that the movie has been following takes a sharp turn straight into a brick wall.  What happened?  All of a sudden (with no warning, foreshadowing, or purpose to the plot) the Japanese lead of the movie dies a sudden, unexpected and depressing death.  He dives into a pond and breaks his neck.  At this point, the viewer is thinking &quot;What happened?&quot;&quot;Well, I dunno.  He's dead... right? Or wait, is she going to do CPR?  No, wait, he's alive.  Nope, no, no-no, he's dead alright.&quot;&quot;So, what happens next?&quot;Now THERE'S a good question, because I'm still trying to figure it out.  The first hour of the movie is followed with a forty-five minute sequence (that seems to be backed with the same, annoying, repetitave song - all forty five minutes of it) that could have been condensed and cut in half by three.  Fifteen minutes would have sufficed to communicate the poignant movies in the plot, which, in the prolonged series of torturous, 'trying-to-hard-to-be-meaningful' scenes are lost.All in all, this leaves the unwitting viewer of the movie (since the film case gives no hint to the bizarre twist in this movie) feeling starved, thirsty, sick, sad, and seriously wishing they had their one-hour-and-forty-five minutes of their life back.",1,A knockout movie... not in a good way.,1089417600,"07 10, 2004",2004,2369,"['quot', 'A', 'Japanese', 'Story', 'quot', 'one', 'movies', 'effect', 'rushing', 'up', 'hitting', 'head', 'PROBLEM', 'instead', 'knocking', 'wind', 'profound', 'messages', 'kind', 'punch-line', 'end', 'movie', 'movie', 'more', 'effect', 'giving', 'one', 'great', 'whopping', 'head-ache', 'leaving', 'just', 'barely', 'awake', 'sane', 'enough', 'feel', 'pain', 'like', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'rule', 'was', 'brilliant', 'quot', 'A', 'Boy', 'quot', 'movie', ""'romance"", 'movie', 'point', 'category', ""'dismally"", 'boring', 'depressing', 'out', 'column.With', 'said', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'pleasantly', 'cute', 'atmospheric', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'unique', 'atmosphere', 'Again', 'however', 'even', 'charming', 'little', 'sequence', 'movie', 'run', 'constantly', 'pot-holes', 'long', 'boring', 'scenes', 'seemingly', 'purpose', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'get', 'better', 'Right', 'when', 'think', 'things', 'are', 'picking', 'up', 'characters', 'plot-line', 'train-of-thought', 'movie', 'been', 'following', 'sharp', 'turn', 'straight', 'brick', 'wall', 'What', 'happened', 'sudden', 'warning', 'foreshadowing', 'purpose', 'plot', 'Japanese', 'lead', 'movie', 'sudden', 'unexpected', 'depressing', 'death', 'pond', 'breaks', 'neck', 'point', 'viewer', 'thinking', 'quot', 'What', 'happened', 'quot', 'quot', 'Well', 'dunno', 'dead', 'right', 'wait', 'going', 'do', 'CPR', 'No', 'wait', 'alive', 'Nope', 'no-no', 'dead', 'alright.', 'quot', 'quot', 'what', 'next', 'quot', 'Now', 'good', 'question', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'followed', 'forty-five', 'minute', 'sequence', 'be', 'backed', 'same', 'annoying', 'repetitave', 'song', 'forty', 'five', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'condensed', 'cut', 'half', 'three', 'Fifteen', 'minutes', 'would', 'have', 'sufficed', 'communicate', 'poignant', 'movies', 'plot', 'prolonged', 'series', 'torturous', ""'trying-to-hard-to-be-meaningful"", 'scenes', 'are', 'lost.All', 'unwitting', 'viewer', 'movie', 'film', 'case', 'hint', 'bizarre', 'twist', 'movie', 'feeling', 'starved', 'thirsty', 'sick', 'sad', 'seriously', 'wishing', 'had', 'one-hour-and-forty-five', 'minutes', 'life', 'back']",N/A

809598,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001L3LUO,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","***1/2 The best thing about ""Japanese Story,"" an Australian film directed by Sue Brooks and set almost entirely in the Outback, is its unpredictability.  Just as you begin to think that the story, written by Alison Tilson, is headed in one particular direction, it does an amazing about-face and leads us down an entirely different, utterly unexpected narrative path.The movie starts off as a fairly standard romantic comedy, involving two strangers who don't like each other very much yet who are forced to spend an inordinate amount of time together.  Sandy is a geologist whose company, against her will and better judgment, has asked her to escort an important Japanese businessman through the wilds of the Australian desert on a sightseeing tour.  The film even begins to seem a bit like a landlocked ""Swept Away"" for awhile, as these two headstrong people - he a Japanese traditionalist with male chauvinistic tendencies and she a no-nonsense, freethinking, independent woman (but both filled with doubts and insecurities beneath the surface) - find themselves stranded in a hostile and remote environment, fighting for survival.  But then the first of the film's numerous plot reversals kicks in and we find ourselves in an entirely different situation altogether.I certainly don't want to spoil anyone's experience of this film by revealing just what those plot twists are, so I will merely state that the film, in the second half, becomes a fairly profound meditation on the precarious nature of life and the almost lightning-paced speed with which tragedy can intervene to bring our worlds crashing down around us.  Toni Collette is heartbreaking as the feisty yet warmhearted Sandy and Gotaro Tsunashima is both tender and stoic as the man from an exotic culture with whom she eventually falls in love.That, of course, is the predictable part.

Through contact with this unusual man, and with the backdrop of the Australian outback, she learns to ""open her heart,"" becomes transformed (as does her companion).But beyond that, after, she has to face who she is (and was), and what she has done, and come to terms with many things (probably for the first time ever), e.g., guilt, regret, irresponsibility.

Examples of this kind could be the French movie ""Stupor and Bewilderment"" or books such as ""My year of meats"". I was therefore looking forward to this movie as a special treat; a movie that will cast a little more light on the very intriguing Japanese culture.This is not a bad movie, but left me nevertheless with a confused feeling. What did I miss? I felt I should have understood more and did not grasp the whole of it. Or maybe what you see is what you get: vacation romance between two different people, a lovely background, and an inner journey each one of them makes into his own soul.My first conclusion therefore is that this is not a movie about different cultures moving closer, as I expected. Truly this is not a regular movie and the story moves along very differently from what you expect. The journey is not made between two cultures (Japanese and Australian) but is more a journey of one person to his inner self. This is more a statement about a cosmpolite human experience, power of nature and human compassion, or so I understand it.The Australian desert is a lovely background for a very interesting developing relationship between the Australian Sandy (played by Tony Collete, and the main reason to watch this movie) and the Japanese Hirumitsu played by Gotaro Tsunashima.The Pilbara desert is breathtaking and Tony collte is a brilliant actress (first noticed in "" Muriel's Wedding ""). The Japanese actor did not manage however to touch me in any way. If it is merely an intention to present him in this way - as somone very reserved and close - I cannot say. It basically seems that there was more of a Western influence on the Japanese visitor then the other way around. The nature and the Australian guide did influence him. The heroine remains outspoken and displays her feelings in a manner, which the Japanese termed vulgar in the beginning. But again, this does not seem to be the main issue but more her change towards some understanding of herself.In spite of the splendid actress this is not a very strong movie and its statements are not always clear.",3,Not so much about different cultures as you might think,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,2284,"['am', 'much', 'drawn', 'movies', 'books', 'explaining', 'Japanese', 'experience', 'Western', 'spectators', 'readers', 'usually', 'done', 'means', 'discussing', 'one', 'Western', 'encounter', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'Examples', 'kind', 'could', 'be', 'French', 'movie', 'Stupor', 'Bewilderment', 'books', 'such', 'year', 'meats', 'was', 'therefore', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'special', 'treat', 'movie', 'will', 'cast', 'little', 'more', 'light', 'very', 'intriguing', 'Japanese', 'culture.This', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'left', 'nevertheless', 'confused', 'feeling', 'What', 'did', 'miss', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'understood', 'more', 'did', 'not', 'grasp', 'whole', 'maybe', 'what', 'see', 'what', 'get', 'vacation', 'romance', 'two', 'different', 'people', 'lovely', 'background', 'inner', 'journey', 'one', 'own', 'soul.My', 'first', 'conclusion', 'therefore', 'not', 'movie', 'different', 'cultures', 'moving', 'closer', 'expected', 'Truly', 'not', 'regular', 'movie', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'very', 'differently', 'what', 'expect', 'journey', 'not', 'made', 'two', 'cultures', 'Japanese', 'Australian', 'more', 'journey', 'one', 'person', 'inner', 'self', 'more', 'statement', 'cosmpolite', 'human', 'experience', 'power', 'nature', 'human', 'compassion', 'so', 'understand', 'it.The', 'Australian', 'desert', 'lovely', 'background', 'very', 'interesting', 'developing', 'relationship', 'Australian', 'Sandy', 'played', 'Tony', 'Collete', 'main', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'Japanese', 'Hirumitsu', 'played', 'Gotaro', 'Tsunashima.The', 'Pilbara', 'desert', 'breathtaking', 'Tony', 'collte', 'brilliant', 'actress', 'first', 'noticed', 'Muriel', 'Wedding', 'Japanese', 'actor', 'did', 'not', 'manage', 'however', 'touch', 'way', 'merely', 'intention', 'present', 'way', 'somone', 'very', 'reserved', 'close', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'basically', 'was', 'more', 'Western', 'influence', 'Japanese', 'visitor', 'then', 'other', 'way', 'nature', 'Australian', 'guide', 'did', 'influence', 'heroine', 'outspoken', 'feelings', 'manner', 'Japanese', 'termed', 'vulgar', 'beginning', 'again', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'main', 'issue', 'more', 'change', 'understanding', 'herself.In', 'spite', 'splendid', 'actress', 'not', 'very', 'strong', 'movie', 'statements', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'clear']",N/A

Struggling for survival in the Australian outback needs cultural cooperation though.Japanese Story is a very solid movie with a well plotted screenplay and the characters are well developed. It is light and heavy at the same time; it is a drama but not a melodrama. Stereotypical jokes were played tactfully both on the Australian and Japanese sides and it does ask you to think. Toni Colette once again gave a spectacular performance after her successes in her late Hollywood blockbusters.This is truly Australian, and very down to earth Australian (hm quite a bit of clich&eacute; here) but it drives away from those same old Irish humour and deals with issues that are more person which we sometimes think definitely impersonal. The script is well written and the dialogues are well constructed. Gotaro Tsunashima played a very traditional Japanese businessman who made the trip the Australia in order to avoid the heavy obligations back home while at the same time bore the weight of his identity on his shoulders most of the time. It is not until he saw the space in the outback that he gradually opens his heart and found his directions. The supporting cast is also good as they gave enormous amount of space to the leads but at the same time performed their functions flawlessly.

Well, 'Japanese Story' is not a conventional desert romance, so if you expect over-arching happiness, stop reading and walk away. Director Sue Brooks and lead actress Toni Collette as Sandy, an ambitious geologist, have an obvious care for Sandy's emotional maturation, and hold the uniqueness and relevance of the film over the desire to please. These wise decisions on Brooks and Collette's part immediately cause 'Japanese Story' to be far better than most love stories. In fact, 'Story' comes close to transcending formulaic exploration of love. Unfortunately, the film stretches on for far too long in its beginning when Sandy meets Hiromitsu (Gotaro Tsunashima) and is borderline stereotypical in its portrayal of Hiromitsu, hindering its potential to be great. However, the film comes alive when Hiromitsu and Sandy begin to grow close, their relationship culminating in a tender love scene that is more of an intelligently handled confirmation of understanding than sex. From here, we too are included in their relationship. We are allowed to see its details, which Toni Collette is able to portray most intricately. Her performance is surprisingly strong. I have not seen her carry a film, and here she does exactly that with power and dimension, visibly portraying her character arc. You believe Hiromitsu is able to disregard cultural differences and discover in her what was missing in his life, as desolate prior to meeting Sandy as the desert they lose themselves in. I would continue exploring the film's quality and direction if the untimely occurrence before the film's final third weren't such a necessary surprise. Now, all I can tell you is to go see the film for yourself. I have done my job.

JAPANESE STORY has received many awards in Australia, and is quite a starightforward storyline to begin with. Toni plays a geologist who is assigned to take a Japanese businessman on a trip to the Outback. At first she is  reluctant, but as the trip progresses, they form quite a friendship. The film moves along at a slow pace and I must admit that I wondered if it would pick up beyongd the bogged car episode.  But wait, there is an unusual twist which you do not see coming! In this scene, Toni demonstrates her fine acting style. This scene alone, although tragic, makes the film that more interesting. How life can change in a single second. After that, the film falls a bit flat, and it is almost as if the Director did not know where to go from there.JAPANESE STORY is worth a look, if anything for the beautiful scenery.

809612,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B0001L3LUO,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[1, 6]","After her internationally acclaimed Muriel's Wedding, and a list of Hollywood films including her Oscar nominated The Sixth Sense and a scene stealing performance in The Hours to the failed Connie and Carla, it was wise that Toni Collette go back to her roots to make a film that showcase all that she's got. So Japanese Story is the perfect vehicle for the former Austrilian Diva to win the ""Austrilian Oscar"", because Hollywood isn't ready to let her carry a dramatic movie like Nicole Kidman would, a fellow Austrilian Diva.Yes, Collette does have a very heavy-duty role to tackle, and she gets to go from one side of the emotional spectrum to the other throughout this movie, and she's more than capable at it. And it was nice to see her speak in her authentic Austrilian accent since years ago. Also, she's totally deglamourized, and the focus is just on her performance, not her image.The multi-layered story is about a roadtrip, cultural clash, interracial romance, and tragedy. Collette met her business associate Gotaro Tsunoshima, and they went for a drive in the outback of Austrilia to see the landscape that their company bought. They drove too far out, and the car got stuck on the road, and they were experiencing some Survivor episode. Collette is tense and aggressive, and she was freaking out, because the weather was changing drastically by nightfall. Tsunoshima is funny and carefree, so the two clashed a great deal. Also he didn't speak English very well, and pronounced desert as dessert. Anyways, they eventually got the car working again, and they slowly became fond of each other. They even got intimate with each other in the heat of the moment, even thought he has a wife back in Japan. Collette's world turned upside down when Tsunoshima dived into a shallow lake, and died instantly. She was beyond horrified, and couldn't conceptionalize what to do about the body and breaking the news to his wife and the company......Tsunoshima is the comic relief, and collette is the dramatic force, and she is in every scene. This is probably her best performance to date, and it's a must-see if you are a fan.",4,On the road with Toni Collette and Gotaro Tsunoshima.,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,2129,"['internationally', 'acclaimed', 'Muriel', 'Wedding', 'list', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'including', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'scene', 'stealing', 'performance', 'Hours', 'failed', 'Connie', 'Carla', 'was', 'wise', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'go', 'back', 'roots', 'make', 'film', 'got', 'Japanese', 'Story', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'former', 'Austrilian', 'Diva', 'win', 'Austrilian', 'Oscar', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'ready', 'let', 'carry', 'dramatic', 'movie', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'would', 'fellow', 'Austrilian', 'Diva.Yes', 'Collette', 'have', 'very', 'heavy-duty', 'role', 'tackle', 'go', 'one', 'side', 'emotional', 'spectrum', 'other', 'movie', 'more', 'capable', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'speak', 'authentic', 'Austrilian', 'accent', 'years', 'ago', 'Also', 'totally', 'deglamourized', 'focus', 'just', 'performance', 'not', 'image.The', 'multi-layered', 'story', 'roadtrip', 'cultural', 'clash', 'interracial', 'romance', 'tragedy', 'Collette', 'met', 'business', 'associate', 'Gotaro', 'Tsunoshima', 'went', 'drive', 'outback', 'Austrilia', 'see', 'landscape', 'company', 'bought', 'drove', 'too', 'far', 'out', 'car', 'got', 'stuck', 'road', 'were', 'experiencing', 'Survivor', 'episode', 'Collette', 'tense', 'aggressive', 'was', 'freaking', 'out', 'weather', 'was', 'changing', 'drastically', 'nightfall', 'Tsunoshima', 'funny', 'carefree', 'two', 'clashed', 'great', 'deal', 'Also', 'did', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'very', 'well', 'pronounced', 'desert', 'dessert', 'Anyways', 'eventually', 'got', 'car', 'working', 'again', 'slowly', 'became', 'fond', 'other', 'even', 'got', 'intimate', 'other', 'heat', 'moment', 'even', 'thought', 'wife', 'back', 'Japan', 'Collette', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'Tsunoshima', 'dived', 'shallow', 'lake', 'died', 'instantly', 'was', 'horrified', 'could', ""n't"", 'conceptionalize', 'what', 'do', 'body', 'breaking', 'news', 'wife', 'company', 'Tsunoshima', 'comic', 'relief', 'collette', 'dramatic', 'force', 'scene', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'must-see', 'are', 'fan']",N/A

Extraordinary is the word I'd use to describe the feelings it evokes through the film, which starts out like a comedy but as the layered and subtle human feelings are unfolded gradually, all of a sudden, strikes the climax with a sudden tragedy. Toni Collectte gives a most powerful performance as the tough, vanity-free Australian geologist Sandy, who took a handsome, taciturn Japanese businessman Hiromitsu (Gotaro Tsunashima) on a trip around the Western Australia's remote Pilbara Desert. The story-telling moves naturally along the line where the contrast and comparison of two different cultures are reflected. Yet, on another level, the film is faithful to human love, which is depicted in a most beautiful and subtle way, through mutual attractions between Sandy and Hiromitsu - however distinctively opposite their cultural background may be - when all they have is the bare, vast, red land of natural beauty. The cinematograph has captured the grandeurs of the desert sceneries as well as the delicate subtleties with equal sensitivity.
