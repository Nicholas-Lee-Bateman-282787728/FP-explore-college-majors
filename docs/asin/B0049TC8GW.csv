It is easy to see how some people would get bored and trash this movie; however, the development of the victims' story in the character of Helen sets this movie apart. This movie deeply disturbed me because I developed empathy for the character Helen. She represented all of the Green River Killer's victims; down on their luck girls who got into the wrong pickup truck. At the time of the murders many people had the attitude, ""who cares, they are just prostitutes"". Helen's story showed that the victims were real people with hopes and dreams. The plot revolving around the detective (that guy who played ED on that TV show with Julie Bowen and J.D's brother on Scrubs)was kind of mediocre. That being said, the plot involving Helen makes this movie unique and worth watching.

I thought it was a little too long, but this guy killed so many and it took so long for his capture, that it had to be long.  If you like murder mysteries, you will like this movie.  Also, as far as I know it is accurate and true.  The movie was not gory, but managed to be scary anyway.

1390268,A1ZEKEE140M6JO,B0049TC8GW,"S. Souza ""horror fan""","[4, 5]",The other reviewers weren't wrong here. I saw this movie a couple of nights ago and it was the most in depth study of all the hard work and perseverance it took to catch this psychotic maniac who was also a coward killing girls as young as 15. I think people should watch movies like this even if they are adverse to violence to see what kind of sick demented people there are in the world. If they did they would probably take more precautions to make sure they and their loved ones are more secure. The acting in this movie is excellent and the side perspective from one of the victims makes it feel more like it is happening to you. This movie will definitely make you appreciate the hard work our law enforcement officers put in to catch these people.

1390269,A31CXEZDNUT3OF,B0049TC8GW,The Busy Bee,"[2, 7]","I was very disappointed when watching this movie, as a reader of many serial killer novels and viewer of movies on the subject.Understandably since this was a Lifetime movie, it wasn't going to be of the best quality or the grittiest approach - that's a given. But I am surprised to see the ratings on it so high, unless it's due to this being one of a very small group of Green River Killer movies even out there.Mainly the story being told from the perspective of one of the victims makes it hard to swallow - not so much when she is still alive and you are seeing her backstory as to how she became a prostitute - But moreso when she becomes a ghost. Any film where the ghost is appearing to the police officer/detective = cheese factor. It can rarely be done convincingly in a mainstream movie, let alone a Lifetime or Hallmark. It just comes of as contrived and low-budget.The ghost pleading with the lead detective to keep going, find my murderer, etc. is paired with an over-arcing ""religious"" aspect that the detective brings up all too often in the extra draggy scenes that are taking up space anyway. It gets old real fast. I am a Christian woman, and so feel no shame in saying that there ARE places in films where it belongs - in the right movies. There are also contexts where it can be overused and forced. This was one of those instances. It felt preachy, and frankly distracting to the story - whether the detective was a Christian man or not. It just didn't play well.The detecitve's struggle to solve the case over years and years is a historical given - but it felt like years and years watching it. Since it is a historical story - we know what happens and who dunnit, there's no need to drag us through every detail of the waiting game too. Without any grittiness (which is fine) there needs to be pace and suspense to compensate in a serial killer tale. This film lacked both.The only compliments I have is that there didn't need to be any gore to make the murders believable and pitiable on film. There were enough red herrings and shadow play with the suspects the detectives pursued, that you get sucked into their plight of never catching the guy until far down the line. Although the actor they chose as Gary Ridgeway looked more Mexican to me than Caucasion, but that's more of a casting nuance.Overall, there are MUCH better serial killer movies out there than this. The approach of ""repentant-hooker-ghost-hear-my-tale-and-take-heed"" frankly ruined it for me and made it less credible and more Hallmark Sunday evening.",2,Cheesy dead victim narration drags and has no suspense,1345075200,"08 16, 2012",2012,2548,"['was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'reader', 'many', 'serial', 'killer', 'novels', 'viewer', 'movies', 'subject.Understandably', 'was', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'best', 'quality', 'grittiest', 'approach', 'given', 'am', 'surprised', 'see', 'ratings', 'so', 'high', 'due', 'being', 'one', 'very', 'small', 'group', 'Green', 'River', 'Killer', 'movies', 'even', 'there.Mainly', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'perspective', 'one', 'victims', 'hard', 'swallow', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'still', 'alive', 'are', 'seeing', 'backstory', 'how', 'became', 'prostitute', 'moreso', 'when', 'ghost', 'film', 'where', 'ghost', 'appearing', 'police', 'officer/detective', '=', 'cheese', 'factor', 'can', 'rarely', 'be', 'done', 'convincingly', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'let', 'alone', 'Lifetime', 'Hallmark', 'just', 'contrived', 'low-budget.The', 'ghost', 'pleading', 'lead', 'detective', 'keep', 'going', 'find', 'murderer', 'etc', 'paired', 'over-arcing', 'religious', 'aspect', 'detective', 'up', 'too', 'often', 'extra', 'draggy', 'scenes', 'are', 'taking', 'up', 'space', 'anyway', 'old', 'real', 'fast', 'am', 'Christian', 'woman', 'so', 'feel', 'shame', 'saying', 'ARE', 'places', 'films', 'where', 'right', 'movies', 'are', 'also', 'contexts', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'overused', 'forced', 'was', 'one', 'instances', 'felt', 'preachy', 'frankly', 'distracting', 'story', 'detective', 'was', 'Christian', 'man', 'not', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'well.The', 'detecitve', 'struggle', 'solve', 'case', 'years', 'years', 'historical', 'given', 'felt', 'years', 'years', 'watching', 'historical', 'story', 'know', 'what', 'who', 'dunnit', 'need', 'drag', 'detail', 'waiting', 'game', 'too', 'grittiness', 'fine', 'be', 'pace', 'suspense', 'compensate', 'serial', 'killer', 'tale', 'film', 'lacked', 'only', 'compliments', 'have', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'gore', 'make', 'murders', 'believable', 'pitiable', 'film', 'were', 'enough', 'red', 'herrings', 'shadow', 'play', 'suspects', 'detectives', 'pursued', 'get', 'sucked', 'plight', 'never', 'catching', 'guy', 'far', 'line', 'actor', 'chose', 'Gary', 'Ridgeway', 'looked', 'more', 'Mexican', 'Caucasion', 'more', 'casting', 'nuance.Overall', 'are', 'MUCH', 'better', 'serial', 'killer', 'movies', 'there', 'approach', 'repentant-hooker-ghost-hear-my-tale-and-take-heed', 'frankly', 'ruined', 'made', 'less', 'credible', 'more', 'Hallmark', 'Sunday', 'evening']",N/A
