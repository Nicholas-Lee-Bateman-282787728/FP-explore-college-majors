Teacher from the north gets sent to a school down south full of juvenile delinquents.  He's a damn fine actor, naturally, and the kids are just awesome.  I don't even like kids, okay?  But these are hilarious.  Crude humor and talking with expressive gestures as, I suspect, nobody does as well as the Italians.  Some serious problems too, not just plot points and BS.

499791,A3Q77CS1DEQLMG,B00000FA1A,Alessandro Bruno,"[55, 58]","I saw this film several times - I was born and went to elemntary and grade school in Naples - as it reminded me all to well of both the incredible warmth, generosity and spirit of my fellow Neapolitans as well as the many evil and decaying aspects of life that persist.  I was lucky enough to live in the City itself and go to a better school; however, the film is actually based on very real events and is merely somewhat adapted to ease the translation into film.  The movie - and most of the dialogue - is based on a book that collected the essays of grade 3 students in the De Amicis school in Arzano, a poor suburb of Naples, in the late 80's. The teacher had collected the genuine and honest tales of life as precieved by his students.  In the film the teacher comes from another city through bureaucratic error; in the book he's as Neapolitan as pizza.  The excellent children actors - who were chosen among regular school children in Arzano (called Corsano in the film) - in fact use dialogue that is lifted directly from the essays.  Unfortunately, to capture the full humor, knowing Italian is not enough, it's necessary to understand Neapolitan dialect and the psychology of Neapolitans.  One of my favorite characters - apart from the briosche loving fat kid (I love briosche also) is the old and very sarchastic uncle who advises the baby that life is tough and hardly a collection of smiles.  Like all Wertmuller's films, this one has a lot of humanity and is ultimately optimistic about the future of humanity.  i suppose that's why she chooses so many of her film subjects among the very human people of Naples.",5,"&quot;Me, let' shope I'll make it&quot; - Simple and touching film",1007424000,"12 4, 2001",2001,1627,"['saw', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'was', 'born', 'went', 'elemntary', 'grade', 'school', 'Naples', 'reminded', 'well', 'incredible', 'warmth', 'generosity', 'spirit', 'fellow', 'Neapolitans', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'evil', 'decaying', 'aspects', 'life', 'persist', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'live', 'City', 'go', 'better', 'school', 'however', 'film', 'actually', 'based', 'very', 'real', 'events', 'merely', 'somewhat', 'adapted', 'ease', 'translation', 'film', 'movie', 'most', 'dialogue', 'based', 'book', 'collected', 'essays', 'grade', '3', 'students', 'De', 'Amicis', 'school', 'Arzano', 'poor', 'suburb', 'Naples', 'late', '80', 'teacher', 'had', 'collected', 'genuine', 'honest', 'tales', 'life', 'precieved', 'students', 'film', 'teacher', 'city', 'bureaucratic', 'error', 'book', 'as', 'Neapolitan', 'pizza', 'excellent', 'children', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'chosen', 'regular', 'school', 'children', 'Arzano', 'called', 'Corsano', 'film', 'fact', 'use', 'dialogue', 'lifted', 'directly', 'essays', 'Unfortunately', 'capture', 'full', 'humor', 'knowing', 'Italian', 'not', 'enough', 'necessary', 'understand', 'Neapolitan', 'dialect', 'psychology', 'Neapolitans', 'One', 'favorite', 'characters', 'apart', 'briosche', 'loving', 'fat', 'kid', 'love', 'briosche', 'also', 'old', 'very', 'sarchastic', 'uncle', 'who', 'baby', 'life', 'tough', 'hardly', 'collection', 'smiles', 'Wertmuller', 'films', 'one', 'lot', 'humanity', 'ultimately', 'optimistic', 'future', 'humanity', 'i', 'suppose', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'film', 'subjects', 'very', 'human', 'people', 'Naples']",N/A
499792,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00000FA1A,Grady Harp,"[75, 76]","CIAO, PROFESSORE is a film that deserves to be in everyone's collection.  Every aspect of this utterly charming story is so well done that it feels perfect.  Based on actual 3rd grade children's essays from a school outside of Naples, Italy, the script sings and dances in words that only children could have spoken.  Lina Wertmuller takes this fine script and populates it with fine actors: Paolo Villaggio is inimitable as the Professor who comes form Northern Italy to the squalor of Southern Italy with all of the ideals of a dedicated teacher in place - or out of place, as he finds in the poverty and crime stricken city of Corsano; Isa Danieli is the coarse and world-hardened Principal of the school; and the children who begin as renegades and slowly enter a mutual transformation with the Professore are played by 'non-professional actors' gleaned from Naples.  The children steal the show, so individual and committed are they to their roles.  A film about poverty and misguided kids could be depressing, but Wertmuller and her fine cast make this a celebration of the human spirit without ever dipping into bathos.  This is one of the finest movies about the teacher/student relationship that has ever been made -and that is saying a lot.

That these were turned into dialogso successfully is a triumph of screen-writing-the originals are poignant, but notso eloquent. Paolo Villagio is perfectlycast as the professore from the North whobrings his Padanic sensibilities to theMezzogiorno. The clash of cultures comedyis predictable but engaging.The chilling aspect of the film is theoverwhelming pessimism that has pervadedthe outlook of children at such an earlyage. It is most un-American and for us,with our rosy views of childhood, disconcerting.It's worth pointing out that if you'retrying to learn Italian by watching movies,(not a bad approach at that) this may notbe right for you.

On the other hand, for people who are notteachers, this is a movie that will be either easilyunderestimated and misunderstood or bring back a number ofchildhood memories, and constitute a gem of sorts.The challenges of a teacher, in some towns as shown in thispicture, are immense. This picture brings into focus the criticalnature of schooling among kids, in the building of theircharacter, intelligence and individual futures. It alsoemphasizes the humanity of both instructor and child, in theunique relationship that must be established between the twogroups, and maintained, for learning to occur, which is comprisednot only of facts, but also of energy, vitality and solidarity,patience, among other things.Aside from the above, there is also the fascinating time capsuleof Naples, Sicily and Southern Italy chosen as the location forfilming, intentionlly underlining the more traditional, 18th and19th century buildings, cobble stone streets, fishing villagesaspects, vs. the modern developments in those same cities, of the20th and 21st centuries.The Italian dialogue is fluid, extremely articulate by the actorschosen. There is almost a laugh a minute, which is at the sametime, tragic, in the sense that a succession of mature, typicallygrown up logical though processes, conclusions and lifeexperiences are spoken.The downside, is perhaps the repetition of the stereotype thatthere is a split not only in cultures, but of character andsocietal behavior among North and South Italy.",4,"Brings back a number of memories, constituting a gem",1178496000,"05 7, 2007",2007,1645,"['CIAO', 'PROFESSORE', 'Marco', 'Sperelli', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'bore', 'andbring', 'back', 'lot', 'stressful', 'experiences', 'anyone', 'who', 'been', 'agrade', 'school', 'professor', 'other', 'hand', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'notteachers', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'either', 'easilyunderestimated', 'misunderstood', 'bring', 'back', 'number', 'ofchildhood', 'memories', 'constitute', 'gem', 'sorts.The', 'challenges', 'teacher', 'towns', 'shown', 'thispicture', 'are', 'immense', 'picture', 'focus', 'criticalnature', 'schooling', 'kids', 'building', 'theircharacter', 'intelligence', 'individual', 'futures', 'humanity', 'instructor', 'child', 'theunique', 'relationship', 'must', 'be', 'established', 'twogroups', 'maintained', 'learning', 'occur', 'comprisednot', 'only', 'facts', 'also', 'energy', 'vitality', 'solidarity', 'patience', 'other', 'things.Aside', 'above', 'also', 'fascinating', 'time', 'capsuleof', 'Naples', 'Sicily', 'Southern', 'Italy', 'chosen', 'location', 'forfilming', 'intentionlly', 'underlining', 'more', 'traditional', '18th', 'and19th', 'century', 'buildings', 'cobble', 'stone', 'streets', 'fishing', 'villagesaspects', 'modern', 'developments', 'same', 'cities', 'the20th', '21st', 'centuries.The', 'Italian', 'dialogue', 'fluid', 'extremely', 'articulate', 'actorschosen', 'almost', 'laugh', 'minute', 'sametime', 'tragic', 'sense', 'succession', 'mature', 'typicallygrown', 'up', 'logical', 'processes', 'conclusions', 'lifeexperiences', 'are', 'spoken.The', 'downside', 'perhaps', 'repetition', 'stereotype', 'split', 'not', 'only', 'cultures', 'character', 'andsocietal', 'behavior', 'North', 'South', 'Italy']",N/A
