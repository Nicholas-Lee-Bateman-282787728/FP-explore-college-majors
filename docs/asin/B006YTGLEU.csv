1522769,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B006YTGLEU,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[1, 1]","In 2011, the daughter of Sam Waterston and the son of Clint Eastwood got together with a ""distant relative"" of Bill Paxton and made a movie about unexpected family ties.  Neither here nor there in the overall scheme of ENTER NOWHERE; I just thought it was interesting.Katherine Waterston plays Samantha, a married woman on her way with her husband to her in-laws' house in New Hampshire to tell them of her recently discovered pregnancy.  Along the way, their car runs out of gas and after the husband doesn't come back for a full day, Sam sets off into the woods in search of help.  She finds a small one-room cabin being occupied by Tom (Scott Eastwood), who claims to have run his car into a ditch three days earlier.  He's been staying in the cabin, waiting for an owner or someone to come along and give him a hand.The next day, Tom decides to try to siphon the gas from his Jeep and transfer it to Samantha's car and get them both out of here.  While he's away doing that, Sam discovers a woman passed out on the porch of the cabin.  Jody (Sara Paxton) says she and her boyfriend got into a fight and he kicked her out of the car.  She's been walking through the woods trying to find help.The three spend another below 0 night in the cabin and the next day Tom sets out to walk as far as he can in hopes of eventually finding civilization.  What he finds is that, walking too far in a straight line just brings him right back to the cabin.  Not only that, but while he was gone Samantha and Jody got into a bit of an argument over their location.  Sam thinks they're somewhere in New Hampshire while Jody insists they're in Wisconsin.  Tom, however, says they're in South Dakota.This is all just to set the stage for the weirdness and the greatness of ENTER NOWHERE.  Despite a clumsy title, some leading dialogue and some lackluster acting, this was a very good movie.  I mean, I don't want to make it out to be LAWRENCE OF ARABIA or anything, it's not going to be hailed as a classic, and probably won't even be seen by many people, but for what it was, I liked it a lot.Then again, I'm a sucker for those one-location movies that center around only a few characters.  I loved the premise of the first SAW until they started cutting away from the bathroom.  And the Tommy Lee Jones/Samuel L. Jackson movie THE SUNSET LIMITED was excellent, and not just because of the caliber of actors in it.  I just love those simple straight-to-the-point stories.  I love the mystery of things like this, three random people wind up at a particular place at a particular time and the viewer is left wondering how and why.  It's the writer and director's jobs to make sure we not only come to understand the how and why, but also to make it not suck.  And ENTER NOWHERE definitely does NOT suck.I was also very pleased to see it didn't fall back on the tired clich&eacute; I was afraid it was headed for, but instead took a braver, less expected road in its climax and resolution.First time director Jack Heller is a little too heavy with the foreshadowing and I don't think he got the strongest performance he could have from Eastwood, while letting Paxton overplay her hand at times, but despite its flaws, I loved ENTER NOWERE and think it's easily a movie any fan of speculative fiction can enjoy.  I'm confused as to why it's labeled a horror movie (the DVD box calls it an ""official selection"" at Screamfest 2011), but it was that label that led me to see it in the first place, so I'll overlook that and just be thankful I got to see and enjoy it.",4,Enter Nowhere,1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,3547,"['2011', 'daughter', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'son', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'got', 'together', 'distant', 'relative', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'made', 'movie', 'unexpected', 'family', 'ties', 'here', 'there', 'overall', 'scheme', 'ENTER', 'NOWHERE', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting.Katherine', 'Waterston', 'Samantha', 'married', 'woman', 'way', 'husband', 'in-laws', 'house', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'tell', 'recently', 'discovered', 'pregnancy', 'way', 'car', 'gas', 'husband', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'full', 'day', 'Sam', 'off', 'woods', 'search', 'help', 'small', 'one-room', 'cabin', 'being', 'occupied', 'Tom', 'Scott', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'have', 'run', 'car', 'ditch', 'three', 'days', 'earlier', 'been', 'staying', 'cabin', 'waiting', 'owner', 'someone', 'come', 'along', 'give', 'hand.The', 'next', 'day', 'Tom', 'try', 'siphon', 'gas', 'Jeep', 'transfer', 'Samantha', 'car', 'get', 'here', 'away', 'doing', 'Sam', 'woman', 'passed', 'out', 'porch', 'cabin', 'Jody', 'Sara', 'Paxton', 'boyfriend', 'got', 'fight', 'kicked', 'car', 'been', 'walking', 'woods', 'trying', 'find', 'help.The', 'three', 'spend', 'below', '0', 'night', 'cabin', 'next', 'day', 'Tom', 'out', 'walk', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'hopes', 'eventually', 'finding', 'civilization', 'What', 'walking', 'too', 'far', 'straight', 'line', 'just', 'right', 'back', 'cabin', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'gone', 'Samantha', 'Jody', 'got', 'bit', 'argument', 'location', 'Sam', ""'re"", 'somewhere', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'Jody', ""'re"", 'Wisconsin', 'Tom', 'however', ""'re"", 'South', 'Dakota.This', 'just', 'set', 'stage', 'weirdness', 'greatness', 'ENTER', 'NOWHERE', 'clumsy', 'title', 'leading', 'dialogue', 'lackluster', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'out', 'be', 'LAWRENCE', 'OF', 'ARABIA', 'anything', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'hailed', 'classic', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'seen', 'many', 'people', 'what', 'was', 'liked', 'lot.Then', 'again', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'one-location', 'movies', 'center', 'only', 'few', 'characters', 'loved', 'premise', 'first', 'SAW', 'started', 'cutting', 'away', 'bathroom', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones/Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'movie', 'THE', 'SUNSET', 'LIMITED', 'was', 'excellent', 'not', 'just', 'caliber', 'actors', 'just', 'love', 'simple', 'straight-to-the-point', 'stories', 'love', 'mystery', 'things', 'three', 'random', 'people', 'wind', 'up', 'particular', 'place', 'particular', 'time', 'viewer', 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'why', 'writer', 'director', 'jobs', 'make', 'sure', 'not', 'only', 'come', 'understand', 'how', 'why', 'also', 'make', 'not', 'suck', 'ENTER', 'NOWHERE', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'suck.I', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'pleased', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'fall', 'back', 'tired', 'clich', 'eacute', 'was', 'afraid', 'was', 'headed', 'instead', 'took', 'braver', 'less', 'expected', 'road', 'climax', 'resolution.First', 'time', 'director', 'Jack', 'Heller', 'little', 'too', 'heavy', 'foreshadowing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'got', 'strongest', 'performance', 'could', 'have', 'Eastwood', 'letting', 'Paxton', 'hand', 'times', 'flaws', 'loved', 'ENTER', 'NOWERE', 'think', 'easily', 'movie', 'fan', 'speculative', 'fiction', 'can', 'enjoy', ""'m"", 'confused', 'why', 'labeled', 'horror', 'movie', 'DVD', 'box', 'official', 'selection', 'Screamfest', '2011', 'was', 'label', 'led', 'see', 'first', 'place', ""'ll"", 'overlook', 'just', 'be', 'thankful', 'got', 'see', 'enjoy']",Enter Nowhere

They strike up an uneasy friendship and the next morning Sarah Paxton is found outside the cabin. She's taken in and  at once rubs both people the wrong way with her acerbic style.So far it looks pretty much like some hillbilly slasher flick waiting to start. They occasionally hear distance shots, maybe a hunter and there is even a comment about `squeal like a piggy' but as they talk and realizes each believes themselves to be in a different state hundreds if not thousands of miles from where the others think they are you realize there is more to this cabin, when attempts to leave the place result in them always ending up back at the cabin the serious creep factor settles.This is NOT a slasher flick.

His steely calm demeanor and statements such as to his first ""customer"", ""I'll open it but I don't think you'll like what's inside. Interesting life you've chosen for yourself.

A touch of discontinuity in camera angles and between scenes and locations that affected the flow of the story. A different title might have helped. A deeper discussion of time-space alteration or lives fated by a superior someone would have been interesting.Positives:Anyway, I thought it to be an original, creatively written script. The casting and music were spot on. The dialogue and actors' portrayals were naturalistic, intelligent and intense. The Pac-Man analogy was great. Above all was the manner in which the story was presented so that the audience was a participant in the discovery process at the same time as the characters.

Three stars is my threshold. Four stars is the sweet spot. Anything above four stars is an automatic rental.Enter Nowhere was highly rated. So I took a chance.My wife and I are very glad I did.

The characters were intriguing.Our taste in movies runs to Indie films, quirky movies that are creative and different, often with actors we hadn't seen before. But we're not into quirky for the sake of quirky. David Lynch stretches the limits of what we tolerate. His movies are often just too weird. Predictable is bad. Too weird is bad. Creative, interesting, and different are good.That's Enter Nowhere.

If this is the case, then by all means give this one a look.  This is another solid genre outing for the talented actress, especially if the gory Shark Night isn't your thing, or Last House on the Left is too intense.The plot resembles nothing less than a classic Twilight Zone setup with many satisfying twists and reveals along the way.  I suspect the movie had a similar budget to your average Twilight Zone episode as well.  Most of the action is limited to one or two locations with the exception of a really cool opening scene set to a catchy rock song.  Don't let the Z-grade budget constraints stop you from enjoying the elaborate plot.  Sometimes the script can be a mouthful, but the young cast are game for it and really sell some of the more exposition laden moments.My one complaint would be the lack of special features on the disc.  The sole extra being a short behind the scenes look that is mostly the first time director doing a little bit of shameless self promotion.
