His mom Marie(Tuesday Weld) is a die-hard Elvis Presley fan. So to &quot;make her happy&quot;,Johnny and his buddies &quot;kidnap&quot; Elvis(David Keith) after a concert via an anesthetic,and drive him to the Wolfes' home. It was there when Elvis awoke. Johnny wanted Elvis to stay so his mom can meet him(Elvis). Elvis subtracts 16 years off his life. He shaved off his big heavy sideburns and wore an outfit that he regularly wore in 1956. Johnny told Elvis,&quot;My mom says you looked the coolest in '56!) Marie had returned home from the hospital after being severely beaten up by her drunk and physically abusive boyfriend(Chris Mulkey). She finds &quot;young&quot; Elvis at the top of the Wolfes' staircase,playing guitar and singing one of Marie's favorites,&quot;Love Me&quot;. A shocked Marie changes into a beautiful dress and invites Elvis to stay for dinner. Johnny's little sister(Angela Goethals) is so afraid to sleep in the dark until Elvis convinces her that doing that is not scary. Elvis even redecorates the Wolfes' home and in the process,discards Johnny's rock band posters. At the talent show,Elvis appears with Johnny and his band backing him up. Then Elvis' band of bodyguards fly to Elvis' whereabouts so he can go on with his touring elsewhere. Elvis was like a husband to divorced Marie and a father to Johnny and his sister. At one point in the film,Johnny beats up Steve,Marie's boyfriend,revengefully(&quot;You stay away from my mother!&quot;) At another point,while returning from a grocery store,Johnny is later beaten up by Steve and a couple of Steve's buddies in front of a bar where Steve and his buddies were shooting pool. I dedicate this film to the memory of Elvis Aaron Presley(January 8,1935-August 16,1977). HEARTBREAK HOTEL is strictly fictitious and is no way based on actual events that occurred during the real Elvis' life.

The plot is almost non-existent - indeed, it ADMITS in the opening credits that &quot;there are many stories about the King...this is a fable.&quot;  The...&quot;fable,&quot; you ask?  It's 1972, Johnny Wolfe's Mom, as portrayed by the GORGEOUS Tuesday Weld, runs (and evidentally owns) a decaying motel, and she seems to be suffering from depression.  She even has a jerk of a drunken, abusive boyfriend to make things &quot;dramatic&quot; or something.  So Johnny, in between school, babbling about Alice Cooper, playing with his band (&quot;The Wolfe Pack&quot;), and raising his little sister Pammy, comes to the conclusion that kidnapping &gt;Elvis Presley!&lt; will cheer up his Mom.  See? I TOLD you! CHEESE! NO plot!  Still, watching Johnny &quot;kidnap Elvis&quot; and transform him into &quot;the '56 Elvis&quot; (&quot;that's when Mom said you were the coolest&quot;), and then, the sight of David Keith as Elvis, singing &quot;Love Me&quot; as Mrs. Wolfe comes home from a date - this is Rock and Roll CHEESE at its absolute FINEST, folks.  And Heaven knows, given the current state of the mung that calls itself &quot;rock and roll&quot; right now, we could ALL use a few cheeseburgers (&quot;cheeseburgers,&quot; by the way, are featured quite prominantly in the movie). No use in recounting any more of the plot - except that the next-to-final-scene, where &quot;Elvis&quot; and the &quot;Wolfe Pack&quot; hijack Johnny's high school's talent show and perform the song &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; gives me the EXACT SAME THRILL as ANYTHING in the movie &quot;Woodstock&quot; (&quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; - now that's ANOTHER story altogether...we'll discuss IT later...).

704917,AW3I97UR8NP7T,B000068MBY,"Karen Shaub ""Nickname:  Queen B""","[10, 12]","From the beginning HEARTBREAK HOTEL wants us to know that the story it is going to tell us has nothing whatsoever to do with the real life of Elvis Presley. In fact it proclaims;""In the kingdom of rock and rollThere are many legends,But only one King.This is a fable about him.The time is 1972.""The story that unfolds takes place in the small town of Taylor, Ohio, a depressed and depressing place where Marie Wolfe (Tuesday Weld) owns a small hotel called the Flaming Star, named in honor of an Elvis presley movie. Marie's life has always revolved around Elvis as did her husband's before he ran off with another woman and left her alone ages ago to raise their two kids, Johnny who's about 17(played by Charlie Schlatter)and Pammie who's considerably younger. Marie's life has degenerated into boozing it up every night with a series of boyfriends, her latest being Steve who isn't exactly popular with Johnny, but then none of her boyfriends have been big with him. After a fight over breakfast one morning Johnny stomps off. He's definitely the adult in their relationship and he's tired of having to shoulder all the responsibility. Besides, he has troubles of his own; his band The Wolfetones has been rejected 3 years in a row for the school talent show and, even, worse, he hasn't got a prayer with the girl of his dreams-- Beth,who auditions for the show by playing Dylan's ""Positively 4th Street"" as if it were a classical piece on the piano, and when asked who the composer was she replies ""An obscure 20th century artist."" Johnny adores her; she's got beauty and guts!Wouldn't you know it? Just when things on the home-front seem to be improving, the plot sickens. After a night at the drive-in watching yet another old Elvis movie, Johnny and his mother bond in a way they never had before. They start to really talk, have a meaningful dialogue and all sorts of other stuff that would make Dr. Phil perk up hopefully. Then, alas, Steve shows up and Johnny is left waiting on the couch for Mom to come back ""in 10 minutes"". As it turns out she did have a good excuse for staying out all night though, they were in a car accident and she wound up in the hospital...after they had an argument and he slapped her around a little first of course. That does it for Johnny. He has to take some sort of action. He simply can't bear seeing his mother so unhappy anymore. He has to find some way to cheer her up and fix her up.Then he sees the article in the newspaper; Elvis is appearing in Cleveland on Saturday! Talk about fortuitous, and really short notice! That's when the brilliant idea springs into his mind fully formed--he'll get Elvis to go on a date with his mother! THAT OUTTA DO IT! So with about a day and a half at most to concoct and carry out his diabolical scheme, Johnny and his friends swing into action with the help of Rosie at the pizza place, an enormous pink Cadillac, a bottle of ether, and a lifetime's worth of knowledge of Elvis his mother had imparted to him. How could he fail?He doesn't. And the next morning he has a soon-to-be-pissed-off Elvis lying unconcious on a couch in one of the hotel's unused rooms. Pammie studies Elvis and asks Johnny what he's going to do with him. Johnny says, ""Give him to Mom as a welcome home present."" ""I think she'll like him better than the earrings I got her,"" she replies.If I've made this movie sound dreary or gloomy or dismal in anyway, please disregard whatever it was that I said that made you feel that way. This is not some boring fim about a disfunctional family, this is a comedy through and through--its just that its a comedy with a very big heart and a weird premise. All that stuff about Johnny's mother is simply a set up for the rest of film, and even THAT isn't totally devoid of humor. Once Elvis (played by David Keith) enters stage right, things turn into every fan's idea of what it would be like to kidnap their favorite singer/actor. He behaves exactly as Elvis should behave; he's arrogant and isolated and lonely but it turns out that what he's really needed all along was to get to be a regular person again (and eat copious amounts of really greasy cheeseburgers),if just for a little while. It just that Elvis' ideas of ""a regular person"" aren't quite the same as everyone else's.Life lessons are learned, truths are exchanged, Charlie learns how to be cool and Elvis remembers what cool really is, and everyone emerges the better for their having met, including the audience. This is another entry in my JUST PLAIN FUN Movie Category, and You don't have to be an Elvis fan to enjoy it. You can take my word for that since I have NEVER been an Elvis fan and saw this film originally simply because it got some good reviews from both Siskel AND Ebert. It wasn't long after that I bought my first vhs copy and later my dvd.All of the performances are first rate. David Keith and Charlie Schlatter have the most screen time with most of the weight falling on David Keith, 'cause if you ain't buying Elvis you ain't got a movie, right? Some critics thought that 1988 was too soon for a movie of this type, that Elvis was still too fresh in our minds and that David Keith bore little resemblance to him physically. That didn't bother me at the time and it bothers me even less now. Both Keith and Schlatter are very engaging actors who are more than capable of making us accept the film's somewhat looney premise, and in the process they also manage to bring an unexpected amount of depth to what could have been mere cardboard characters in the hands of lesser talents. They also both do their own singing in this film and I think they do a slam bang job of it. There may be better Elvis imitators than Keith, but I seriously doubt that they are as good an actor as he is, and you need both qualities to make this character work--the part calls for an actor not an aper. Schlatter is the teenager every mother would want as a son, and Weld is totally convincing as the lonely mother who barely looks older than her son. She has always been somewhat under-rated inspite of excellent performances in her youth in such films as PRETTY POISON and SOLDIER IN THE RAIN.I just looked at this review--my God, no one is going to read all of this! However I would like to add one thing for posterity; THIS ISN'T A FABLE, its more like a fairy tale. The Elvis presented here is pure and clean and unreal. I don't think he even drinks a beer much less suffers from drug withdrawl which obviously would have been the case in real life. In a fable some moral is usually presented at the end, and there is none here. This is more like Spielberg's E.T. where the strange loveable creature has to return to his own planet at the end, never to return again.",5,E.T.

Tuesday Weld which I am sure that you may already know of, that co-started with the real life Elvis Presley, co-stars in this movie, and this time she is a diehard Elvis Presley fan. The year is 1972, and of course if the story is supposed to have Elvis Presley in it, it would have to take place during his lifetime. Now maybe it didn't win over the critics, but at least Elvis fans should be able to love and enjoy this film. But instead, it is David Keith that is taking on this role, and he is in and out so quickly, that you might even forget that he is in the movie. He is seen very breifly in the beginning of the movie, and then the story shifts over to a small town in Ohio. Johnny Wolfe (Charlie Schlatter) is a roll and roller that dreams of winning a school talent show, but every year he gets cut, and this year he believes it going to be differenmt, but once again, he and his bandmits goes to an aduition, and once again the souts cuts them, which he believes they don't like Rock and Roll. He lives with his Mom Marie Wolfe (Tuesday Weld) and kid sister Pam Wolfe (Angela Goethals), who believes that somebody is out to get her, if the lights are out when she is sleeping, and so she likes to sleep with the lights on. And he doesn't like his Mom's boyfriend, and when she is injured in a car crash, while on a short drive, and is in the hopsital. Johnny is waken up by a cop that came to his house to deliver the news, along with news that the door was left open. So he goes to visit her in the hospital, and then has a brainstrom of how he can cheer her up. And when he learns that Elvis Presley (David Keith) is coming to Cleveland to play a concert. So he and his badnmates makes a plan to go to the show and kidnap him, so he can bring him home to his mother. But Johnny has another problem, how to even get close to Elvis, and he remembers that Elvis was very close to his own mother Gladys Presley, until her death, and they know of a cook (Jacque Lynn Colton) that looks like her, so now he has to get her to agree to go to the show with them, looking exactly like Elvis' late Mother, and of course you should know how Elvis would react to this. And they take off for Cleveland, to attend the show, and to lure Elvis Presley away from his bandmates, and secuirty. And the plans works, but of course Elvis doesn't like this idea at first. Now I don't know that the scene in this movie, that they totally remake a scene from Loving You, which involves Elvis Presley himself is really that needed.",4,Get ready Elvis fans for Heartbreak Hotel,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,2676,"['Christopher', 'Columbus', 'directed', 'Home', 'Alone', 'movies', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'first', '2', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'directed', 'film', 'named', 'Heartbreak', 'Hotel', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'am', 'sure', 'may', 'already', 'know', 'co-started', 'real', 'life', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'co-stars', 'movie', 'time', 'diehard', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'fan', 'year', '1972', 'course', 'story', 'supposed', 'have', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'would', 'have', 'take', 'place', 'lifetime', 'Now', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'critics', 'least', 'Elvis', 'fans', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'love', 'enjoy', 'film', 'instead', 'David', 'Keith', 'taking', 'role', 'so', 'quickly', 'might', 'even', 'forget', 'movie', 'seen', 'very', 'breifly', 'beginning', 'movie', 'then', 'story', 'shifts', 'small', 'town', 'Ohio', 'Johnny', 'Wolfe', 'Charlie', 'Schlatter', 'roll', 'roller', 'dreams', 'winning', 'school', 'talent', 'show', 'year', 'cut', 'year', 'going', 'be', 'differenmt', 'once', 'again', 'bandmits', 'aduition', 'once', 'again', 'souts', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Mom', 'Marie', 'Wolfe', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'sister', 'Pam', 'Wolfe', 'Angela', 'Goethals', 'who', 'somebody', 'out', 'get', 'lights', 'are', 'out', 'when', 'sleeping', 'so', 'sleep', 'lights', ""n't"", 'like', 'Mom', 'boyfriend', 'when', 'injured', 'car', 'crash', 'short', 'drive', 'hopsital', 'Johnny', 'waken', 'up', 'cop', 'came', 'house', 'deliver', 'news', 'news', 'door', 'was', 'left', 'open', 'visit', 'hospital', 'then', 'brainstrom', 'how', 'can', 'cheer', 'up', 'when', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'David', 'Keith', 'coming', 'Cleveland', 'play', 'concert', 'badnmates', 'plan', 'go', 'show', 'kidnap', 'can', 'bring', 'home', 'mother', 'Johnny', 'problem', 'how', 'even', 'get', 'close', 'Elvis', 'Elvis', 'was', 'very', 'close', 'own', 'mother', 'Gladys', 'Presley', 'death', 'know', 'cook', 'Jacque', 'Lynn', 'Colton', 'so', 'now', 'get', 'agree', 'go', 'show', 'looking', 'exactly', 'Elvis', 'late', 'Mother', 'course', 'should', 'know', 'how', 'Elvis', 'would', 'react', 'take', 'off', 'Cleveland', 'attend', 'show', 'lure', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'away', 'bandmates', 'secuirty', 'plans', 'works', 'course', 'Elvis', ""n't"", 'like', 'idea', 'first', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'scene', 'movie', 'totally', 'remake', 'scene', 'Loving', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'really', 'needed']",Heartbreak Hotel
704924,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000068MBY,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","Written and directed by Chris Columbus (writer of GREMLINS, director of the first two HOME ALONE movies & the first two HARRY POTTER movies), HEARTBREAK HOTEL is a comedy with a dash of romance. It's a fictional story that takes place in 1972. Johnny Wolfe (Charlie Schlatter) is a high school senior who lives with his younger sister and his mother in a small hotel called the Flaming Star in Taylor, Ohio. Johnny has his own band and they are pretty good and he just wants to play some rock and roll. However, The Wolfetones have never been able to play at the largest gig of the year in Taylor: the annual high school talent competition. Each year the judges come up with some lame excuse about why The Wolfetones (Johnny's band) can't play. Johnny's mother, Marie (Tuesday Weld) loves her kids and is doing her best to raise her kids and run the hotel, but she longs for some romance in her life. Instead, she ends up dating dead-beats. She's also crazy about Elvis. After Marie's latest boyfriend beats her and sends her to the hospital when they are in a car accident, Johnny decides he's going to do something really special for his mom. He's going to get Elvis to go on a date with his Mom. At first Johnny's friends think he's crazy, but soon they are caught up in his crazy idea, too. Elvis is coming to Cleveland and that's where they'll make their move.The first extended scene with Elvis occurs after his arriving at his hotel in Cleveland. It is here that we see an Elvis that is struggling and on the brink; he's a man on the edge who longs for someone or something to reach out and bring him back inside. In many ways, HEARTBREAK HOTEL is a movie about what could have happened. It makes wonder if something like this had happened, would Elvis have ended up dying in a bathroom floor just five years later.Like many of Chris Columbus' pictures, HEARTBREAK HOTEL is a little movie with a lot of heart. David Keith portrays Elvis and he does a spectacular job. Keith doesn't look exactly like Elvis, but he embodies the spirit of the man before he was completely corrupted by drugs and alcohol. The Elvis of HEARTBREAK HOTEL is one that loves cheeseburgers, who is used to getting his way, but still tries to appease his fans. At the same time, he's a lonely and broken man who feels he's forgotten and perhaps lost who he really is. This is an Elvis that still has hope.  That hope is given a chance to blossom when Elvis checks into HEARTBREAK HOTEL. It's a feel-good place of second chances that won't always let you feel lonesome tonight.",4,An American Legend in an American Fable,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,2556,"['Written', 'directed', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'writer', 'GREMLINS', 'director', 'first', 'two', 'HOME', 'ALONE', 'movies', 'first', 'two', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'movies', 'HEARTBREAK', 'HOTEL', 'comedy', 'dash', 'romance', 'fictional', 'story', 'place', '1972', 'Johnny', 'Wolfe', 'Charlie', 'Schlatter', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'who', 'younger', 'sister', 'mother', 'small', 'hotel', 'called', 'Flaming', 'Star', 'Taylor', 'Ohio', 'Johnny', 'own', 'band', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'just', 'play', 'rock', 'roll', 'However', 'Wolfetones', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'play', 'largest', 'gig', 'year', 'Taylor', 'annual', 'high', 'school', 'talent', 'competition', 'year', 'judges', 'come', 'up', 'lame', 'excuse', 'why', 'Wolfetones', 'Johnny', 'band', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'Johnny', 'mother', 'Marie', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'kids', 'doing', 'best', 'raise', 'kids', 'run', 'hotel', 'romance', 'life', 'Instead', 'up', 'dating', 'dead-beats', 'also', 'crazy', 'Elvis', 'Marie', 'latest', 'boyfriend', 'hospital', 'when', 'are', 'car', 'accident', 'Johnny', 'going', 'do', 'something', 'really', 'special', 'mom', 'going', 'get', 'Elvis', 'go', 'date', 'Mom', 'first', 'Johnny', 'friends', 'think', 'crazy', 'soon', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'crazy', 'idea', 'too', 'Elvis', 'coming', 'Cleveland', 'where', ""'ll"", 'make', 'move.The', 'first', 'extended', 'scene', 'Elvis', 'occurs', 'arriving', 'hotel', 'Cleveland', 'here', 'see', 'Elvis', 'struggling', 'brink', 'man', 'edge', 'who', 'someone', 'something', 'reach', 'out', 'bring', 'back', 'inside', 'many', 'ways', 'HEARTBREAK', 'HOTEL', 'movie', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'wonder', 'something', 'had', 'happened', 'would', 'Elvis', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'dying', 'bathroom', 'floor', 'just', 'five', 'years', 'later.Like', 'many', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'pictures', 'HEARTBREAK', 'HOTEL', 'little', 'movie', 'lot', 'heart', 'David', 'Keith', 'Elvis', 'spectacular', 'job', 'Keith', ""n't"", 'look', 'exactly', 'Elvis', 'spirit', 'man', 'was', 'completely', 'corrupted', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'Elvis', 'HEARTBREAK', 'HOTEL', 'one', 'cheeseburgers', 'who', 'used', 'getting', 'way', 'still', 'appease', 'fans', 'same', 'time', 'lonely', 'broken', 'man', 'who', 'forgotten', 'perhaps', 'lost', 'who', 'really', 'Elvis', 'still', 'hope', 'hope', 'given', 'chance', 'blossom', 'when', 'Elvis', 'HEARTBREAK', 'HOTEL', 'feel-good', 'place', 'second', 'chances', 'wo', ""n't"", 'always', 'let', 'feel', 'lonesome', 'tonight']",Heartbreak Hotel
