I didn't like it.I couldn't possibly tell you why.Watching it again, I enjoy the heck out of this movie.This movie is great.  It explores the character of Mr. Freeze, and if you'll recall his episode ""Heart of Ice"" won the show an Emmy.The character relationships are very well fleshed out.  And the story and action won't let you down.The only downside to this movie is the odd use of CGI.  Obviously, the creators of this film were hoping for something groundbreaking, but the CGI and traditional animation don't mesh well together so it's a little distracting at times.As a plus, the movie stands alone and is great as it is.But for fans of the series, there are little nuances to the characters that are made all the more enjoyable by having watched the show.In other words.

Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[0, 0]","In an effort to save his dying wife, Nora, Victor Fries (aka Mr. Freeze) kidnaps Barbara Gordon, Commissioner Gordon's daughter because his wife needs an organ transplant and Barbara possesses the same rare blood type as his ailing wife. Batman and Robin are quickly hot on his tail and soon it's a game of cat and mouse between the Dynamic Duo and Mr. Freeze as our heroes seek to find Barbara before it's too late and she falls victim to Mr. Freeze's evil plan.After the amazing thrill that was Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, and when I heard they were making another Batman animated movie, I was pumped. Mask of the Phantasm was insanely good and since SubZero was to be done in the same style by the same people, my expectations were high. While not as good as Phantasm, SubZero is still a solid flick. What makes it cool is it's a team-up movie because Batman's joined by Robin, something Phantasm didn't have. You also get to briefly see Batgirl in costume in this one as well.Mr. Freeze is a tricky bad guy because while powerful, you take away his freeze gun and he's got nothing and it's easy to turn him into a one-trick-pony that way and diminish the complicated character that he is. Not in SubZero. You get to see Mr. Freeze for who he is under that armor and, well, he's just a heartbroken guy who's doing what he believes is the right thing. So distraught over his wife's fatal illness but brilliant enough to figure out a cure, he's willing to stop at nothing to save the woman he loves, even if that means killing an innocent person in the process. For those who have gone through immense heartbreak, you know how easy it is for unclear thinking to reign and how nothing but emotion takes over.This flick also showed how Batman and Robin feed off each other and work together, and not in that ""Way to go, chum"" way that was the staple of the 1960s Batman series. You see two professional crime fighters playing off each other's strengths, giving each other ideas, each keeping the other encouraged and balanced as they fight the good fight.There was also some 3D animation in this movie, back when 3D was a new thing. While the 3D parts didn't blend against the 2D as seamlessly as they do nowadays, it did add a ""wow"" factor to the flick--for its time--and kept Batman on the cutting edge of animation.I'm really pleased with this movie and it gets better with each viewing, and with an ending that is both sad but satisfying, Batman and Mr. Freeze: SubZero is a Bat-movie that should be part of any Bat-fan's collection.",4,Pretty Decent Followup to Mask of the Phantasm,1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,2538,"['effort', 'save', 'dying', 'wife', 'Nora', 'Victor', 'Fries', 'aka', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'Barbara', 'Gordon', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'daughter', 'wife', 'organ', 'transplant', 'Barbara', 'same', 'rare', 'blood', 'type', 'ailing', 'wife', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'are', 'quickly', 'hot', 'tail', 'soon', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'Dynamic', 'Duo', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'heroes', 'seek', 'find', 'Barbara', 'too', 'late', 'victim', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'evil', 'plan.After', 'amazing', 'thrill', 'was', 'Batman', 'Mask', 'Phantasm', 'when', 'heard', 'were', 'making', 'Batman', 'animated', 'movie', 'was', 'pumped', 'Mask', 'Phantasm', 'was', 'insanely', 'good', 'SubZero', 'was', 'be', 'done', 'same', 'style', 'same', 'people', 'expectations', 'were', 'high', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Phantasm', 'SubZero', 'still', 'solid', 'flick', 'What', 'cool', 'team-up', 'movie', 'Batman', 'joined', 'Robin', 'something', 'Phantasm', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'also', 'get', 'briefly', 'see', 'Batgirl', 'costume', 'one', 'well.Mr', 'Freeze', 'tricky', 'bad', 'guy', 'powerful', 'take', 'away', 'freeze', 'gun', 'got', 'nothing', 'easy', 'turn', 'one-trick-pony', 'way', 'diminish', 'complicated', 'character', 'Not', 'SubZero', 'get', 'see', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'who', 'armor', 'well', 'just', 'heartbroken', 'guy', 'who', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'thing', 'So', 'distraught', 'wife', 'fatal', 'illness', 'brilliant', 'enough', 'figure', 'out', 'cure', 'willing', 'stop', 'nothing', 'save', 'woman', 'even', 'killing', 'innocent', 'person', 'process', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'immense', 'heartbreak', 'know', 'how', 'easy', 'unclear', 'thinking', 'reign', 'how', 'nothing', 'emotion', 'over.This', 'flick', 'also', 'showed', 'how', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'feed', 'off', 'other', 'work', 'together', 'not', 'Way', 'go', 'chum', 'way', 'was', 'staple', '1960s', 'Batman', 'series', 'see', 'two', 'professional', 'crime', 'fighters', 'playing', 'off', 'other', 'strengths', 'giving', 'other', 'ideas', 'keeping', 'other', 'encouraged', 'balanced', 'fight', 'good', 'fight.There', 'was', 'also', '3D', 'animation', 'movie', 'back', 'when', '3D', 'was', 'new', 'thing', '3D', 'parts', 'did', ""n't"", 'blend', '2D', 'as', 'seamlessly', 'do', 'nowadays', 'did', 'add', 'wow', 'factor', 'flick', 'time', 'kept', 'Batman', 'cutting', 'edge', 'animation.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'pleased', 'movie', 'better', 'viewing', 'ending', 'sad', 'satisfying', 'Batman', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'SubZero', 'Bat-movie', 'should', 'be', 'part', 'Bat-fan', 'collection']",N/A

Out of all the animated films I have, this one-I'm not too crazy about. Don't get me wrong, the animation is just fine and the story itself is servicable(although a bit simplistic) but it's just not too compelling to me. Course, Mr. Freeze(except for his appearances on ""The Batman"") hasn't always been a very intriguing adversary for Batman to go up against, anyways. Because of that, he has never really been a big favorite of mine out of all of Batman's villains. At least, we get some cool extras on the DVD.  For extras, WB provided a cast and crew listing and a variety of theatrical trailers for other Batman products along with the teaser trailer for Scooby Doo. We're also given ""The Art of Batman"" that features production artwork interspersed with action from the film. An artist briefly demonstrates how to draw Batman in the ""Get the Picture"" feature(click the slow-mo if you want to learn how to draw him), and finally there's ""The Hunt for Mr. Freeze"" game.

The animation is brisk, the tales are even swifter, and the conclusions typically pack an emotional wallop not commonly associated with animation.SUBZERO isn't 'substandard' Bat-telling fare by any stretch of the imagination.  The tale -- Mr. Freeze once again is up to trying to save the life of his beloved wife, Nora, in suspended animation, and it just so happens that Barbara Gordon (aka Batgirl) has the proper DNA to make it possible -- is intelligent, insightful, and captivating.  The events happen quickly, and the action-packed ending puts everything in the budget up on the screen.In fact, if SUBZERO has any shortcomings, it might be that the intended blending of traditional animation with CGI isn't as seamless as the producers might've wanted it to be.  There are whole sequences that stand out because of the contrast, but, in the end, they do little to detract from the story.SUBZERO briefly explores the tragic nature of Mr. Freeze, a reluctant supervillain forced to do what he does out of the attempts to save his wife's life.

Until the recent Batman: Mystery Of The BatWoman, I ranked this one the weakest of the Batman animated features.I first saw it when it came out in the late 90's and now that I've seen it again, I can appreciate it for what it was and is. It'll never match MOTP but then again, it isn't supposed to. The only weak point visually is that it tries to merge the ""Dark Deco"" animation with computer graphics. In some instances, it works but in others it looks terrible!As for the story, it follows the series very closely. In fact that is the one thing it DOES have over MOTP and that is it follows the series where as MOTP was more of a stand alone story that could've happened at any point (my guess is that ""Mask"" happened between Seasons 1 & 2).In the series, Batman encounters Mr. Freeze twice. The second time (in an episode called ""Deep Freeze"" which is available on BatMan: The Animated Series, Volume 3), Mr. Freeze is reunited with his thought to be dead wife Nora! I won't tell that story as you'll have to get that set to see it or catch it on rerun on TV.Anyway, we find Mr. Freeze with his still frozen wife Nora in the frozen North when an explorer group accidentally breaks up his home and puts his wife in jeopardy! Fueled by his desire to save her, he enlists an old friend of his (who has troubles of his own) to perform an illegal operation to save Nora's life. Unfortunately, this operation involves Barbara Gordon (Batgirl)!Naturally, this brings Batman and Robin into the situation. While not as gripping as MOTP or even BatMan Beyond: Return Of The Joker, it is an exciting tale that has an ending that is both sad but joyous nonetheless. This one, in my opinion, is also safer for kids under 13 than MOTP or BB:ROTJ so while not totally a family film, I don't think there is anything in it that parents will get offended over. I should also note that this was the final Batman feature to use the style of animation that was used in the original 65 episodes of the TV series and in ""Mask Of The Phantasm.""MINOR POINT: I do have a bit of a problem with the title.

The tragic story of Mr. Freeze's search for a cure for his wife concludes, but it's not the ending he hoped for. It's well written with a story that's compelling as it is heart wrenching. It also marks the beginning of a change in the overall look of the Batman animated universe.

For the last time, he's going to try and save the life of his comatose wife through criminal means.Victor Fries, now turned into the tragically cold Mr. Freeze, enlists the help of a villainous master surgeon to conduct an organ transplant on his wife Nora. When there are no available organs, Freeze commands him to GET one. And the one person in Gotham who matches Nora's blood type is Barbara Gordon, secretly Batgirl.The early minutes of the film present us with a posh shindig, to which Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson are invited. They show up looking dapper in their tuxedoes, both with one thing on their minds but in different ways. Bruce is womanizing the beautiful female guests and Dick is eagerly awaiting the arrival of the object of his affections: Barbara.Dick and Barbara begin what one can only call a budding romance, which stays canon with comic book lore. While the two always flirted and hinted at becoming involved during their adolescence, they never really started dating until reaching their early 20's.Sometime later while Dick and Barbara are on a date at a swing dance club, Mr. Freeze has tracked her down, bringing along two fierce polar bears as ""henchmen."" They tear up the place and Dick does a pretty good job trying to protect Barbara, but I know he's better than the display he put on. He's Robin for crying out loud and I expected more of a fight. ""Pretty good"" just isn't good enough for Batman's second as far as I'm concerned. So, to make a long story short, after a tricky car/motorcycle chase through the outskirts of Gotham Hills, Freeze gets away with his hostage.Of course, Batman and Robin eventually sniff out their whereabouts through sheer detective work, which is nice to see from time to time. Just as Barbara is on the verge of escape, she hits a wall and the Dynamic Duo have to officially bail her out of trouble. The last sequence is absolutely beautiful. Everyone is trapped on an oil refinery in the middle of the Atlantic and, through negligence and dramatic influence on part of the writers, it's going to explode soon. Fighting fires, polar bears, Mr. Freeze and a trigger-happy doctor, Batman, Robin and Barbara Gordon manage to save themselves, the day, and a few lives in one spectacular finish with a happy ending.The artwork is sometimes good, sometimes wonderful. I had the feeling that there was a different artist in the first half than in the second - with the second half being better by leaps and bounds. It was almost as if there's a seperate person handling the animation when Dick and Bruce are in costume. Either way, no real complaints here.

It was meant to draw attention to the Batman franchise enough to coincide with the appauling Batman & Robin live-action movie, although most people were suprised at how much better this film was from that one.The story takes place after Season 3 of Batman: The Animated Series, but sometime prior to when Dick Grayson left to become Nightwing. Mr. Freeze has been hanging out in the North Pole with his trained polar bears, and his wife Nora has been ""chilling"" inside the same oversized snowglobe until Freeze can find a cure for her. Unfortunately, an arctic exploration crew crashes his pad, causing Nora to relapse into her disease. Making his way to Gotham, Freeze abducts Belson, an old medical colleague who is desperate to make some quick money to pay off some debts. Freeze offers him a gold deposit to help him save Nora. They look for an compatible donor to replace one of Nora's organs that was damaged(which one is never said), and their search leads them to Barbara Gordon. After kicking some ass as Batgirl, Barbara goes out with Dick on what looks like the beginning of their romance. Freeze breaks up their date, and kidnaps Barbara. Dick and Bruce head to the Batpoles and locate where Barbara is being held, which is at an offshore oil rig. Barbara manages to get away, but Belson accidently starts a fire. Nora gets trapped underneath in the fire, so Mr. Freeze helps Batman and Robin get her out of the burning wreck, although Freeze seemingly doesn't make it out. Although the movie concludes with Freeze back in the Arctic conveniently making it to an outpost station to see the CNN report that Nora recovered thanks to Bruce Wayne's big wallet.Of the three original Batman: TAS animated movies, this one probably has the weaker plot to it. I don't mind them bringing back Mr. Freeze, although you would've had to see the prior episodes of the series to get his backstory which is pretty essential for watching this movie. There also is an absence of the Batman Family doing much any real ""crime-fighting"" in this, aside from a scene at the beginning where the Dynamic Duo make a real thing about stopping a couple of crooks when they could've taken them out easily. It's also a little disappointing when we catch up with Freeze again in Season 4 of the TV series where he returns again as an emo psychopath because he's then just a head on a robot spider-legs(BTW, Freeze's suit was originally designed by Mike Mignola of Hellboy fame).

The criticisms usually come down to two things, the prominence of Barbara Gordon over Batman, and the awkward melding of traditional with computerized animation. Regarding the former, the movie is a bit slow at the midpoint with its focus on Barbara and her many attempts at escape, and while Batman's absence is noticeable, he fortunately has starred in many other cartoons, so his reduced role here is not as troublesome. Concerning the latter, the two different animation styles do appear awkward at first sight, but are much less apparent, if not downright enjoyable, after repeated viewings. The Batwing especially looks awesome. The story once again focuses on the touching and tragic relationship between Victor Fries and his beloved wife Nora, with Babs being thrust right into the heart of matters as a possible savior for Nora. Unfortunately for her, she may not be around afterwards to take any bows. The movie climaxes with a thunderous crescendo atop an abandoned oil derrick during an exciting action packed finale reminiscent of a James Bond flick. The romantics among us will enjoy the closing few minutes especially.

This time, the WB opted not to release the film to theaters, but rather go directly to video and television.  Though this movie appeared to show a lack of faith on the part of Warner Brothers regarding this new animated Batman feature, this second animated film is still jam-packed with explosive action, gripping performances and drama that will keep you frozen in your seats until the very end.""Batman & Mr. Freeze:  Sub Zero"" pits the Dark Knight against his coolest foe (pun intended), Mr. Freeze.  Desperate to find a cure for the disease that is killing his wife, Mr. Freeze seeks a blood donor that is compatible to his precious Nora.  His search leads him to none other than the daughter of Gotham City police commissioner James Gordon, Barbara Gordon (aka Batgirl).  To save Barbara it will take the combined strength of Batman (Kevin Conroy) and Robin before Barbara's fate is sealed in ice.With the great response to ""Batman:  Mask of the Phantasm"" expectations were undoubtedly high for this animated sequel.  As I said earlier the move from theatrical release to direct-to-video did cause some concern, the movie still proved to be very strong, and continued the story of Mr. Freeze's desperate search for a cure from the animated series into this movie.  Another great aspect of moving Freeze's storyline into a feature film allowed the creators of the film and the series to go darker with the story, showing just how cruel Mr. Freeze could get when his desperation takes over.  Though technically a sequel in terms of being the second Batman animated film, this movie focuses more on Mr. Freeze and his motives than on anything Batman does.In truth, as much as I enjoyed this movie, I do agree with Warner Brothers' decision not to release this movie theatrically, because I feel that the movies subject matter and pace would not have yielded great box office numbers.  With that being said, I still highly recommend this movie to any fans of Batman in any shape or form.  It is still a well-crafted film with great voice acting, action scenes, and storytelling.

Now you mu...","[3, 4]","You might be surprised to see that there is virtually no character development in SubZero, which is in stark contrast to Mask of the Phantasm. If you aren't caught up on the animated TV series, you'll have a hard time appreciating this movie. SubZero focuses too much on action. That's fine for episodes of the animated series, but it's not good when a movie is all action and no heart. This movie feels rushed, like no one put enough effort into making a good movie. It's like they hastily made a three-part story for the TV series, threw in some ""fancy"" computer animation, then suddenly decided to call it a movie. SubZero would've been a great three-part storyline for the TV series if they'd lose the stupid computer animation. Put simply, SubZero just doesn't work as an animated movie.Robin/Dick Grayson and Batgirl/Barbara Gordon are in the movie just as often as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Robin is a good sidekick for Batman in the animated TV series, and he's also a good addition to this movie. I'm just glad that Robin wasn't annoying, because I still have bad memories of Robin in Joel Schumacher's Batman movies. Unfortunately, Batman has to share his screentime with Batgirl and Robin. Compared to the screentime Batman gets in Mask of the Phantasm, I was disappointed that Batman wasn't in SubZero more often. But then again, it was absolutely necessary for Robin and Batgirl to be central characters in this movie.Mr. Freeze always was a sympathetic character in the TV series. In this movie, he's still trying to find a cure for his wife's disease. And if that wasn't enough, he's also adopted an orphaned Inuit boy. But the boy is annoying, and I would've preferred it if he wasn't in the movie. Shortly after the movie begins, a submarine breaks through the surface in the frozen Arctic Ocean. Mr. Freeze keeps Nora (his wife) in a cryogenic chamber inside an Arctic cave. Unfortunately, the sub has surfaced in the middle of Mr. Freeze's cave, and Nora's chamber has been smashed beyond repair. The chamber kept Nora's disease from becoming fatal. Now that her chamber is destroyed, she only has a few weeks to live. An infuriated Mr. Freeze uses his ice gun to freeze the entire crew of the submarine. Frankly, I find it a little hard to believe Mr. Freeze would be able to single-handedly take over the sub, herd the entire crew outside of the sub, and then freeze everyone. So I take this as further proof that the filmmakers rushed this movie, and didn't put enough thought into certain areas of the plot.One incredibly annoying scene is when Commissioner Gordon is talking about Barbara. He doesn't know his daughter is Batgirl. So while Gordon is going on about how sweet and gentle Barbara is, the movie keeps cutting back to her beating up bad guys while in her Batgirl costume. You can tell the filmmakers just threw that scene into the movie for any viewers who aren't familiar with the TV series, so that everyone will be clear about Barbara's secret identity.Apparently, Nora needs an organ transplant in order to survive. I don't believe they say which organ(s), but that doesn't matter. Barbara is a perfect match, so Freeze tracks her down. At a fancy party for rich people, which Dick and Barbara are attending, Mr. Freeze shows up, demanding that Barbara come with him. Dick tries to intervene, and gets smashed by a full-grown polar bear. One would think he'd at least have the wind knocked out of him, and take a while to recoup. But being smashed by such a huge bear barely fazes him. And did I mention that Freeze's goons are POLAR BEARS? The bears are annoying, and I really wish Mr. Freeze decided to use human goons instead.The movie's computer animated sequences are at their worst when Dick is on the motorcycle. The computer animation is bland, and lifeless. To put it simply, I hate the computer animation. But my main complaint is that when you have the regular animation and the computer animation side by side, it looks awkward. If you ever saw Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings cartoon (which used regular animation and some other kind of live action animation) you'll have an idea of why it's a bad idea to use two very different kinds of animation in the same movie.There's a few other things in SubZero that annoyed me. Instead of creating a theme for this movie, they just borrowed Danny Elfman's theme from Tim Burton's first Batman movie. Michael McCuiston does the background music in this movie. He's not bad, but he's no Shirley Walker. Another thing that annoyed me was that you can see claw marks in the pavement from the robber as Robin was reeling him in, right before throwing the robber in the trash. I could see Superman leaving marks in pavement like that, but not a common thug.My favorite part of the movie is when it shows the Batwing leaving the Batcave. That part was done by computer animation, and I have to admit that it looks cool. But the computer animation looks horrible when it shows the Batwing flying low across the water toward the oil rig. These days I doubt you'd ever see an abandoned oil rig storing vast quantities of oil. But you just know that the whole thing will catch fire and explode at some point during the final showdown. And ONE CHARACTER DIES. But don't get excited about it. Once this particular character has served their purpose in the movie, the character is disposed of by the filmmakers. SubZero is a must-see for fans of the TV series, because a lot of important events happen in this movie. But if you're not familiar with the TV series, I'd advise you to stay away.",3,SubZero should've been three episodes of the animated TV series,1155427200,"08 13, 2006",2006,5569,"['might', 'be',

This movie, like Mask of The Phantasm, is a animated movie based on Bruce Timm's animated series. This movie is one of my favorite batman movies both animated and live action. It's in the top 10. Compare to Mask of the Phantasm, this film is kind of underwhelming, but a good film nevertheless.Subzero is based on an episode of the animated series called Hearts in Ice, which centers around the villain Mr. Freeze. Like many incarnations in this universe this Mr. Freeze is my favorite incarnation of the character. In the old comics and in Batman and Robin he was a generic bad bad bent on world domination. In this movie, he is more of a tragic character. Freeze's wife has an incurable disease, and he is trying to come-up with a cure. This plot element is the driving factor for the film.The other main characters were good as well. Kevin Conroy as Batman is always great. He is my favorite Batman. Robin was okay. Barbara Gordon/Batgirl is okay as well, though she is mostly the damsel in distress in this film. Her relationship with Robin was pretty nice.The art and animation is great as usual. The score is good as well. Most of the music is from the animated series.The problem that I have with this film, and that others might have as well, is that it is basically a rehash of Hearts in Ice. If you have watched the series and seen that episode, you might be a bit disappointed. It basically has the same plot as the episode except extended. This movie is not in the same league as Mask of the Phantasm. However, it is still a fun and entertaining movie. This movie did take itself seriously and treated the viewers like adults, unlike Batman and Robin.Overall, this film is an example of what Batman and Robin should have been.

Joel Schulmacher was woefully misguided when he agreed to take up the directing reins from Tim Burton.  But the catoon show rose to the occasion, with the richly inspired &quot;Mask of the Phantasm,&quot; which delved deep into the noir and physclogical depths of the dark knight, without letting up on pacing or the films' central mystery.  &quot;Sub-Zero&quot; doesn't quite reach the heights of &quot;Phantasm,&quot; but it is more than a worthy successor to it.  One advancement on display in &quot;Zero&quot; is the fluid combination of computer and traditional animation.  The action set-pieces with Robin trying to chase down Mr. Freeze on a crowded highway and the climax abord an abandoned oil-rig are quite impressive.  However, experienced animated Batman director Boyd Kirkland never allows the animation and effects to impeed the fluid, air-tight plotting or the character interaction and development, which are things Kirkland and his team of animators, editors and voice-actors do consistently and satisfyingly well.Plot: Batman, Robin and Batwoman, alwalys with their hands full, now have to contend with Mr. Freeze, who has found fresh determination in fighting the heroes and in searching for a cure for his very ill wife, whose condition is getting steadily worse.  She needs a transplant, but her blood-type is so rare that searching for a donar is proving near impossible.  And to complicate things, if a living person became a donar, that person would die.  But Mr. Freeze is hell-bent on saving his wife.  In the comics and various t.v., Mr. Freeze was always the most sympathetic anatagonist towards Batman and his cohorts.  In &quot;Sub-Zero,&quot; one cannot but feel sorry for him.  He has searched feverishly for his wifes' cure, became his sub-zero state in the process and now it may all be in vain.It is the combination of smart plotting, swift-pacing and solid animation that make &quot;Sub-Zero&quot; memorable.  The cartoon show has outdone Joel Schulmacher and his disappointing attempts to make Batman come to the screen.  He is in need of what the cartoon and Tim Burton had I abundance:  Storytelling, character development and sensible villians.

87946,AZXFS8GCTSQ5R,079072880X,NF,"[1, 1]","This was the second of the Batman feature-length movies, released in 1998, following &#34;Mask of the Phantasm.&#34; This was originally done for television, so it's in the standard 4:3 aspect ratio rather than widescreen.The movie opens with an eerie journey through an underwater Arctic world, as a submarine wends its way under the ice cap. As the submarine passes, we see a man in shorts spear a fish and then head up through the ice to an Arctic cave with two pet polar bears and a young native lad. The man in shorts is, of course, Dr. Victor Fries, aka Mr. Freeze. He greets his wife, Nora, frozen in her containment vessel until a cure can be found for her.Meanwhile, the submarine has reached its destination and begins to surface, planning to punch through the ice so that the scientists on board can gather specimens and data for research. Unfortunately, where they choose to surface is the middle of Victor's cave, The resulting upheaval overturns and destroys the capsule that was keeping Nora alive. Needless to say, Victor is not happy and he expresses his displeasure as only Mr. Freeze can.The scene turns to Gotham, where Batman and Robin (Dick Grayson) are foiling a jewelry store robbery, as Alfred calls to remind them they are late for a party. Barbara Gordon is also late for the party, and we see why, as she stops a mugging in progress. At the party, Dr. Gregory Belson is talking to his stockbroker. He made some unwise investments in the market and he did it on margin, calls that are coming due in a few days. Unless something can be done, he's ruined.On his way home from the party, Dr. Belson encounters snow and ice, just as the radio announces 90-degree weather. His car crashes and Mr. Freeze greets him as an old colleague, &#34;I've got a patient who needs you.&#34; At Freeze's hideout, Belson delivers the bad news that the rupturing of the containment vessel caused Nora's ailment to resurface and she has only a couple of weeks to live, unless she gets an organ transplant. Belson sees an opportunity: he'll bypass all of the usual protocols and get her moved up on the waiting list but only if Freeze is willing to pay.Unfortunately, when they check the records, they are unable to find any available organ that will match Nora's needs. At least no organ from someone who has recently died. Their only alternative is to use someone currently living. After searching the files, they find the ideal candidate: Barbara Gordon.The rest of the movie runs in parallel tracks as Barbara tries to figure out why Freeze wants her and how she can escape after being kidnapped, while Batman and Robin race against time to figure out where is being held, by whom, and why. The two threads come together in an unusual location, as matters wend their way to a climactic conclusion.The polar bears and the cute Eskimo boy were just a bit too much for me to believe and I think the story would have been better without them. I did like watching Batman put the various pieces together, as he worked out why Barbara was needed and where she was being held. There was a bit more luck involved than I would like but it was excusable. The animation was acceptable for its time, 16 years ago, but it looks a little dated today. The CGI sequences, in particular, were a little too obviously CGI and weren't that well integrated with the hand-drawn animation.

That movie, of course, is to comic book movies what the Hindenberg was to blimp sales: less than a windfall, to put it mildly.  The animated film, however, retains the same earnest, serious, and smart demeanor that earned the television show its Emmys and works magnificently over the feature-length running time here.  Warner can't quite seem to believe that grown-ups are sick of the campy approach, so the DVD is, farcically, aimed at children, without storyboards, concept art, or a reasonable documentary.  That can't detract from the feature, however, which fleshes out the Mr. Freeze character (easily the best villain on the show) tenfold, giving voice actor Michael Ansara a real chance to shine, and even to upstage the excellent Kevin Conroy, who has been doing an exemplary Batman since the series launched.  This is a minor quibble, really, as Batman always plays second fiddle to the villains, even in the better comic books and the first two movies (can you remember a single Michael Keaton line from &quot;Batman?&quot;  Neither can I.)  At any rate, if you have any affection for the Batman characters left after Arnold says, &quot;Everybody... chill,&quot; check this one out.

Freeze has his wife in cryogenic suspension in a tube that he's kept for many years in an arctic cave.Unfortunately a sub decides to use that same cave to crash through in order to get some kind of expedition going (we never find out the why or how of that, but that's not a vital plot point).  Sadly the sub knocks down the tube and his wife Nora lies out in the open.  Freeze and his bears are not happy.  He kills the sub crew with his freeze gun in revenge.Fast-forward to Gotham, where Freeze reinstates  himself with an Eskimo boy and the help of a financially shot doctor who tells Freeze they need a live organ donor to save Nora's life.Sadly, Batgirl, aka Barbara Gordon, has the rare blood type.  She is soon kidnapped (which we get to see a high speed chase by Dick Grayson!) and made prisoner on an oil derrick.Interesting themes -- regardless of the title, it's really a Robin & Batgirl story.  Batgirl plays the majority of the film as the athletic Babs Gordon who despite her small size kicks some pretty serious butt.The action really starts flying on the oil derrick.  The animation here, with the lights, the dark and the cool flying Batplane are a sight to behold.  Shivers!Chooosing to save someone's life despite what they've done or how ""bad"" they are is one theme.  Another, forgiveness and gratitude.

Right along with Batman episodes like, &quot;Be A Clown,&quot; and &quot;If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?,&quot; &quot;Heart of Ice&quot; was one of the best episodes. Our first exposure to Mr. Freeze is cold and ambiguous. At first we can only see him as dark and cold; later, Batman watches a video that exposes not only Mr. Freeze's motives, but why he can no longer exist outside of a sub zero environment. (Excellent reversal from fear to sympathy!) But even though Batman feels sorry for him, he has to stop the revenge of Mr. Freeze from hurting innocent people. I STILL cry when I see the end of this episode. The lengthened movie of this episode is a fairly good story; the character development does not take a back seat to effects; and for the most part it holds your interest. But, I can not say this movie was NEARLY as good as the animated episode. (1). Why is Mr. Freeze and his wife in the middle of nowhere to begin with? (2.) The movie DOES NOT have the surprising impact and sudden reversal from fear to sympathy that the episode did. (3.) When Mr. Freeze goes after a live person, he loses too much sympathy too fast. For 90 % of the movie we see him as a sadist rather than a 3D character.

87956,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,079072880X,Simon,"[14, 14]","That's right, Warner Bros has decided to release Sub-Zero to DVD, along with JLA, ROTJ Uncut, and the first five Batman episodes. Sub-Zero was originally a direct-to-video release around late 1997 that was supposed to cash in on the popularity of the Batman and Robin movie, and bridge the gap between seasons of the tv series. HOWEVER, in a rather hilarious twist, the live-action movie bombed, and WB shelved Sub-Zero for a few months so it wouldn't make the movie look worse than it already did.Sub-Zero features Mr. Freeze, one of the best villains from the now-classic Batman cartoons of the early 90's. What made this villain so memorable was the emotionless, monotone voice delivered by Michael Ansara. The villian also has some sentimental value for me, as his was the first episode of Batman I ever saw. The story revolved around Mr. Freeze taking revenge against those who killed his wife and destroyed his life, and was the most emotionally compelling piece of animation I'd seen up to that point.Sub-Zero doesn't quite match that first Mr. Freeze episode I saw, due to some minor points and the fact that I was older, but its still an excellent piece of work. It's better than the last two live-action Batmans, but falls short of Mask of the Phantasm and Return of the Joker. As a recap, Mr. Freeze eventually finds out his wife Nora is still alive, kept in suspended animation. He retreats to the north pole, where he befriends a boy and some polar bears, and spends his time searching for a cure to his wife's disease. A team of explorers accidentally shatters Nora's containment vessel, and Freeze returns to Gotham to find a live organ donor to save his wife. That donor turns out to Barbara Gordon (Batgirl), which puts Batman and Robin on a race against time to find and save her.The vocal talent is excellent, especially Michael Ansara and Kevin Conroy, who still continues to provide the voice of Batman to this day. The animation is really good for a direct-to-video release (hey, when ALL your animated movies are DTV, you tend to do a good job) and includes a lot of CGI enhancements. Some people have had problems with this, citing that the random CGI inserts detract from the movie. For me, it's no big deal, the CGI in this movie, especially of the submarine rising into the caverns in the intro, is impressive.Where the movie falls short is in that Batman feels underutilized. Granted, Batman still has a beefier role than Clooney did in the live-action movie, but Robin and Batgirl tend to eat up more screentime. Nothing wrong with this, but the movie's full title was Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: Sub-Zero, so I expected Batman. I also thought that Barbara's various escape attempts ate up more time than they should have. Finally, the movie doesn't really escape its DTV roots. Where Batman: Mask of the Phantasm was originally a theatrical release and Return of the Joker (Uncut) could have been one, Sub-Zero feels like three episodes of the TV series, albeit three VERY GOOD episodes.Still, Sub-Zero is classic Batman. The new DVD makes for a great addition to your collection, or a great gift for a Batman fan. I've heard the supplements aren't anything overly special, just an intro by Bruce Timm and a game or two, but the disc should be relatively cheap and well worth it.

87962,A2C4EG9LRTNQW1,079072880X,Thomas A. Holmes,"[3, 5]","For me, one of the finest aspects of the Timm/Dini era of animated Batman has been the ability to present some of the old villains as tragic figures. None has been more tragic than Victor Fries/Mr. Freeze, whose attempts to find a cure for his wife have been callously thwarted by big corporations. The producers of the current Batman have carefully sustained Mr. Freeze's story, even to the point of continuing it into the BATMAN BEYOND continuity. For the most part, SUB ZERO allows us to see the vulnerable man as he has been made into a villain, and it preserves Batman's compassion as it wrestles with his obsession for justice. Why the Warner Bros. suits throw money behind projects like the live-action BATMAN &amp; ROBIN when they can find much more worthy stories in their WB Kids! and DC Comics divisions is beyond many of us who follow the Batman mythos. Sure, in SUB ZERO the Dick Grayson/Barbara Gordon romance is forced, the Commissioner Gordon affection for his daughter is saccharine, and the subplot about the Inuit boy is unnecessary; still, this story offers interesting transition between the introduction of Mr. Freeze to the current Batman animated continuity and the later stages of Mr. Freeze discovered in the latter BATMAN &amp; ROBIN ADVENTURES and BATMAN BEYOND.Having said that, I must disagree with many of the Amazon.com reviewers of this piece regarding the animation, which varies in quality throughout the movie. No figure walks naturally in this movie, and eyes often look as if they have been pasted onto heads. The worst transgression, however, comes from the forced combination of the computer animation with the more traditional animation. Unfortunately, the computer animation preserves a type of plastic sheen about it, looking so different from the other animation that it distracts from the viewing experience. The seams show too much. As we have seen, computer-assisted animation can blend well with traditional animation. Notice, for example, how FUTURAMA incorporates both forms seamlessly. Look also at WB's own IRON GIANT to see how computers can help animators bring an idea to life. SUB ZERO deserves better animation work than it has gotten, and WB has missed another opportunity to present Batman with the artistic integrity the character deserves.",3,Poor Animation Mars Fine Story,977702400,"12 25, 2000",2000,2300,"['one', 'finest', 'aspects', 'Timm/Dini', 'era', 'animated', 'Batman', 'been', 'ability', 'present', 'old', 'villains', 'tragic', 'figures', 'None', 'been', 'more', 'tragic', 'Victor', 'Fries/Mr', 'Freeze', 'attempts', 'find', 'cure', 'wife', 'have', 'been', 'callously', 'thwarted', 'big', 'corporations', 'producers', 'current', 'Batman', 'have', 'carefully', 'sustained', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'story', 'even', 'point', 'continuing', 'BATMAN', 'BEYOND', 'continuity', 'most', 'part', 'SUB', 'ZERO', 'see', 'vulnerable', 'man', 'been', 'made', 'villain', 'Batman', 'compassion', 'obsession', 'justice', 'Why', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'suits', 'throw', 'money', 'projects', 'live-action', 'BATMAN', 'amp', 'ROBIN', 'when', 'can', 'find', 'much', 'more', 'worthy', 'stories', 'WB', 'Kids', 'DC', 'Comics', 'divisions', 'many', 'who', 'follow', 'Batman', 'mythos', 'Sure', 'SUB', 'ZERO', 'Dick', 'Grayson/Barbara', 'Gordon', 'romance', 'forced', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'affection', 'daughter', 'saccharine', 'subplot', 'Inuit', 'boy', 'unnecessary', 'still', 'story', 'interesting', 'transition', 'introduction', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'current', 'Batman', 'animated', 'continuity', 'later', 'stages', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'discovered', 'latter', 'BATMAN', 'amp', 'ROBIN', 'ADVENTURES', 'BATMAN', 'BEYOND.Having', 'said', 'must', 'disagree', 'many', 'Amazon.com', 'reviewers', 'piece', 'regarding', 'animation', 'quality', 'movie', 'figure', 'naturally', 'movie', 'eyes', 'often', 'look', 'have', 'been', 'pasted', 'heads', 'worst', 'transgression', 'however', 'forced', 'combination', 'computer', 'animation', 'more', 'traditional', 'animation', 'Unfortunately', 'computer', 'animation', 'type', 'plastic', 'sheen', 'looking', 'so', 'different', 'other', 'animation', 'viewing', 'experience', 'seams', 'show', 'too', 'much', 'have', 'seen', 'computer-assisted', 'animation', 'can', 'blend', 'well', 'traditional', 'animation', 'Notice', 'example', 'how', 'FUTURAMA', 'forms', 'seamlessly', 'Look', 'also', 'WB', 'own', 'IRON', 'GIANT', 'see', 'how', 'computers', 'can', 'help', 'animators', 'bring', 'idea', 'life', 'SUB', 'ZERO', 'better', 'animation', 'work', 'gotten', 'WB', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'present', 'Batman', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'character']",N/A
