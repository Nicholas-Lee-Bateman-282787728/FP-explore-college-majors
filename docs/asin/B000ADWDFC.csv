I kept looking for hidden meaning and symbolism and could never find a connection.  The two main characters are a married couple who have been seperated by the business of their lives.  He is a quiet professor and she is a world famous champion figure skater.  While they have been seperated, the world has begun to go crazy with strange weather, unusual deaths and people becoming untethered from the Earth's gravity.  I thought, at first, that their reunion would be the catalyst for setting things right.  The meaning that only together could they make sense of the world.  But that doesn't happen.  And there's a weird subplot about clones of Elena that just didn't fit with the rest of the story at all.  I read Lostgirl's review and perhaps what you need to do is watch this without any expectation and without looking for meaning.  Simply enjoy the beauty of the movie.

926504,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000ADWDFC,Grady Harp,"[2, 4]","When a film begins with a statement like this from the main character, it usually means that a biopic about a terminally ill patient is coming or that the director wants to make it clear that you're in for a downer.  In IT'S ALL ABOUT LOVE it is clearly the second alternative. One has the feeling that Thomas Vinterberg and writer Mogens Rukov had in mind to make some visceral musings on the future of the planet given the current state of abuse of the environment and human relations, but the result is a convoluted mess of an admixture of infantile script and plodding camera work and silly character non-development that is more of a bore than a sociological/psychological/environmentalist wake-up call.Year: 2021 though costumes, cars, technology are very much 2005.  The TV Big Brother (newscasters) are calmly reporting that Uganda is freezing, that countries in Africa are loosing gravitational pull, and everywhere in the world people are dying in the streets (merely stepped over by pedestrians) from a disease of the heart: the heart ailment etiology is apparently the lack of love and caring and commitment and relationships that have become extinct in this purely industrial society.Enter John Marchevski (Joaquin Phoenix) returning to New York for a quick stopover to have his divorce papers signed by his estranged star ice skater wife Elena (Claire Danes).  But when he arrives in New York he is picked up by men who claim he must go to see Elena as she has a premiere that evening and couldn't meet him at the airport.  Reluctantly John goes along with this (largely abetted by encouragement from his brother Marciello -Sean Penn - who maintains telephone conversation  with him while flying in a weird jet (despite his past fear of flying).To make it brief, Elena has been cloned by the agents who manage her star career and have tied this into her family including her father David (Alun Armstrong) and brother Michael (Douglas Henshall).  Elena senses all is not right, pleads with John to help her and eventually they escape on the run from the 'bad guys'.  Oddly it begins snowing in July, John and Elena discover her clones skating and watch them murdered, and suddenly we're in a vast tundra of frozen land with John and Elena dancing while Michael informs them the 'association' had him sell them out in order for him to survive and Marciello just keeps writing about the world and chatting from his big impaired jet plane trapped in the sky for lack of landing fields and the Africans float up into the air etc etc etc. Yes, it really is that silly.There are some interesting panoramas courtesy of cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and there remains the underlying suspicion that perhaps the film has something to say but just can't decide how to say it.  The use of Joaquin Phoenix, Claire Danes, and Sean Penn is a waste of talent and it remains a serious question as to why they signed on to be a part of this film.

926508,A2T049UQONS0OY,B000ADWDFC,Larry VanDeSande,"[3, 6]","""It's All About Love"" is an art film set in the very near future (2021) that tries to dissect the moral ambiguities relative to cloning. It does so in the midst of several somewhat confusing storylines.One involves an estranged husband and wife (Joachin Phoenix & CLaire Danes) -- a world class ice skater that is the subject of cloning -- a brother that tries to warn them about it, another brother on a jet writing a story about the world (Sean Penn), a highly dysfunctional family gathering, and an ecological disaster that ensures it snows everywhere in the world simultaneously.If this sounds confusing, you're on the right track. The sum and substance of the plot is the cloning, which Danes' handlers are doing to ensure she continues to skate even after she retires. She and husband Phoenix try to escape her certain death and do so into the current unfriendly ecology.At times a gripping thriller and alternately a ponderous art film, ""It's All About Love"" deals more effectively with the topic of cloning than the failed ""Godsend"". Yet the artful Kubrickesque production tends to slow down what little action there is, defeating any momentum that builds in the tense moments, creating a very episodic and disjointed experience.Still, this is a thoughtful art film that succeeds at capturing the viewer's imagination through a combination of plot, solid acting, extreme visual imagery, storyline subtext and outright mysticism.

Well let's try another adjective: different. This is not the same kind of thing we've seen a million times before. In fact it seems to defy genre pigeon-holing.Thomas Vinterberg, co-founder of the Dogma 95 moment towards ""purity"" in cinema made the excellent ""Festen"" and then took his craft to the other extreme with this futuristic fable. Set in a near future where the earth is on the brink of a new ice age the film tells the story of a Polish professor, John and his wife Elena plan to divorce. The couple have grown apart due to Elena's demanding schedule (she's a champion figure-skater) but when John arrives in New York to sign the final divorce papers, Elena begs him not to leave, confessing that she's in a danger that she doesn't completely understand.The plot that follows is twisting and at times intentionally absurd: People drop dead in the streets due to a mysterious heart ailment, in mid-july it starts to snow all over the world, a man once afraid of flying overdoses on his medication and is now afriad to land, and as everything people think they understand is turned upside-down it's impossible to know who to trust.But to view this film you have to put aside conventional notions of narrative structure or how a plot should unfold. Viewing this film is very much like participating in a dream. You have to go where it takes you- even if that's somewhere unusual.Each shot in this movie is beautifully photographed channeling Hitchcock visually. Every thought in Joaquin Phoenix's head seems to appear on his face, while Claire Danes deftly channels a Hitchcock blonde. Alun Armstong and Sean Penn excel in smaller roles.When I first saw this I wasn't sure if I liked it. But I found myself thinking about it a lot in the days following.

Anyway, unfortunately I rented this due to them being in it.I came here to the item page not mainly to review it but to see if anyone actually likes this movie and see that currently there are no positive reviews at all.I often see people say 'this is the worst movie ever'.  I can only think of one worse off my head, 'Pinocchio 964'.  And I am considering really bad movies such as 'Car 54, Where are You?' and 'Anger Management'.  So while I don't think I will ever call any movie 'the worst movie ever', I will definitely say this is one of the worst movies ever without fear of exaggeration.The movie is set in the year 2021.  In this far off distant future time, things will pretty much look as they do know but people will be unexplicably dying in the streets and other people will just step over them as normal occurence.Also, the entire world will be snowing at once and I guess it is implied that all people will die.  (Or maybe not?  All the main characters die and it is stated that the entire earth is snowing all at once.) This 2021 environment has no connection to the story and the viewer is left asking why this was an aspect of the film.  It is such an unformed plot point that the characters wonder why it's snowing in July and the freezing of the entire Earth at once seems to take the entire world by surprise.The main storyline has Phoenix's character coming to have divorce papers signed by this famous Ice Skater wife.  They become reinvolved and he finds out they have made 3 copies of her.  (I assume they are clones, but they never use the word 'clone' in the movie, so again, even to say this is an assumption)The reason seems to be because she has a bad heart and is going to die so they want to keep making money using the 'clones'.The film is full of illogical situations.  For example the 3 'clones' meet the original skater and are amazed that she looks just like them and marvel to have a twin.  Yet the 3 clones have been hanging out together without having any awareness that they looked exactly like each other.  But suddenly when they meet the original, 'wow, she looks exactly like me!'There are MANY comparably illogical happenings.  This movie is full of them.Sean Penn is only in the movie for about 3 minutes total.  His character is entirely unnecessary in regards to the main storyline.Claire Danes does a good job portraying her emotions but nothing in the story causes any connection to care about.  Her talent is totally wasted here.Phoenix seems to realize he got involved in a totally directionless project and appears to be reading his lines like a deer caught in headlights.  He seems to be in a state of shock and regret to have signed on to a movie with such shattered story and direction.Most bad movies, you can see how they missed the mark.  This movie leave you wondering even what the mark was that they missed.I have to believe it will be a long time before I see a movie this bad again.

There are several scenes in the film that are striking and memorable. It's when I try to connect these dots that I run into trouble.I've seen 'It's All About Love' billed as a science-fiction story, or as a thriller, and it is neither. To be frank, while it has many beautiful scenes and thoughtful moments, in the end I found it just falls apart under its own weight.'It's All About Love' is not science fiction in the usual sense. It has many explorations in possible futures - people who literally die of heartbreak, a man who reverses his fear of flying to such a degree that he can no longer bear living while not flying, cloned celebrities, and people who are compelled to float off the surface of the planet are among them. But these ideas are all presented as simply disparate events, with no attempt at explanation or grounding. The movie struck me as more of an exploration into the fantastic than the scientific. Those looking for true science fiction should look elsewhere.The film is plotted methodically, and may feel slow to many. Even so, it tends to lose track of where it's going and get distracted in long journeys of beautiful imagery - red splashes of blood on blue ice, snow in summer, floating bodies tethered to the earth. It's not a fast-paced thriller - it's a deliberate, methodical piece of art that takes its time to get to the point. Those looking for a solid, cohesive story should also look elsewhere.The imagery is beautiful and surreal, and I give it credit here. There are some surreal films of this nature that I love - like the recent 'Moon' or Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean's 'Mirrormask' or Darren Aronofsky's 'pi' or 'Solaris' (either version). But while those films share the strong imagery and methodical plotting of 'It's All About Love,' I came away from those other films feeling that they had a point. There was a definite conclusion, a definite story, a definite progression from point A to point B - and those movies also moved me, often deeply. Whether I felt wonder or disgust or fear or hope, the point is I felt something.At the end of 'It's All About Love,' I felt...nothing.This is a complex film, and an ambitious attempt at...something. In the end, 'It's All About Love' felt to me like a movie about not much of anything. And that's unfortunate.",2,Staggering under the weight of ambition,1301529600,"03 31, 2011",2011,2424,"['first', 'word', 'mind', 'when', 'thinking', ""'It"", 'Love', 'surreal', 'next', 'two', 'are', 'pointless', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'striking', 'memorable', 'when', 'try', 'connect', 'dots', 'run', 'trouble.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'It"", 'Love', 'billed', 'science-fiction', 'story', 'thriller', 'neither', 'be', 'frank', 'many', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'thoughtful', 'moments', 'end', 'found', 'just', 'apart', 'own', 'weight', 'Love', 'not', 'science', 'fiction', 'usual', 'sense', 'many', 'explorations', 'possible', 'futures', 'people', 'who', 'literally', 'die', 'heartbreak', 'man', 'who', 'fear', 'flying', 'degree', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'bear', 'living', 'not', 'flying', 'cloned', 'celebrities', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'compelled', 'float', 'off', 'surface', 'planet', 'are', 'ideas', 'are', 'all', 'presented', 'simply', 'disparate', 'events', 'attempt', 'explanation', 'grounding', 'movie', 'struck', 'more', 'exploration', 'fantastic', 'scientific', 'looking', 'true', 'science', 'fiction', 'should', 'look', 'elsewhere.The', 'film', 'plotted', 'methodically', 'may', 'feel', 'slow', 'many', 'Even', 'so', 'lose', 'track', 'where', 'going', 'get', 'distracted', 'long', 'journeys', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'red', 'splashes', 'blood', 'blue', 'ice', 'snow', 'summer', 'floating', 'bodies', 'tethered', 'earth', 'not', 'fast-paced', 'thriller', 'deliberate', 'methodical', 'piece', 'art', 'time', 'get', 'point', 'looking', 'solid', 'cohesive', 'story', 'should', 'also', 'look', 'elsewhere.The', 'imagery', 'beautiful', 'surreal', 'give', 'credit', 'here', 'are', 'surreal', 'films', 'nature', 'love', 'recent', ""'Moon"", 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'Dave', 'McKean', ""'Mirrormask"", 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', ""'pi"", 'version', 'films', 'share', 'strong', 'imagery', 'methodical', 'plotting', ""'It"", 'Love', 'came', 'away', 'other', 'films', 'feeling', 'had', 'point', 'was', 'definite', 'conclusion', 'definite', 'story', 'definite', 'progression', 'point', 'point', 'B', 'movies', 'also', 'moved', 'often', 'deeply', 'felt', 'wonder', 'disgust', 'fear', 'hope', 'point', 'felt', 'something.At', 'end', ""'It"", 'Love', 'felt', 'nothing.This', 'complex', 'film', 'ambitious', 'attempt', 'something', 'end', 'Love', 'felt', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'anything', 'unfortunate']",N/A

O'Sullivan,"[1, 3]","I have to confess, the only reason I even gave this movie a chance was because of the description on the back which featured two phrases I'd thought I'd never see together in one movie: ""futuristic apocalyptic world"" and ""world-famous ice skater"" - it's that right there that will decide for most if they want to give this movie a chance as well.  I did, and for the most part I liked what I saw... as for what I could understand, that's a totally different matter.Excellent direction and solid performances (although why Sean Penn is in this movie is a complete mystery to me - it seems like he's in a completely different film since he shares no scenes with any of the cast, so his performance comes off the weakest since all he has to play off of is a headset and cell phone) help to ground a lightweight story that manages at once to draw you in, but in the end keeps its distance.It's 2021 and something is wrong with the world.  Gravity is acting up, causing people in Uganda to float right off the planet.  It's snowing in July and you have to be careful to keep track of which days it's safe to drink the water - because if you don't, something bad is going to happen.  There's something wrong with people as well, as they seem to be dropping dead all over the world (and while we never see too many of them, the ones we do see are well placed and realized - it's actually one of the few moments in the film that achieves the kind of raw power and quirk the rest of the film is shooting for).  John is coming to see his wife Elena (the world-famous ice skater) to finalize their divorce, and instead falls right into a mystery.The film does try to keep exactly what's really going on from you, and for the most part it manages to do it very well - but we've seen this before.  There's the ghost of Kafka here rounded out with a Ira Levin punch line that once you know the trick ends the movie well before the credits roll.  Once you get it, you lose interest, and instead of pulling its focus and landing some punches (but, to be fair, it does land three very well towards the end that will haunt you for an hour or two after), the film opts to fall into something like a dream and drifts into a hazy and unsure ending - just what has happened, why and how is left literally up in the air.For some this will be a disappointment, while for others looking to read between the lines or color outside of them, then there are some touching and lyrical moments that are worth watching for.Not for everyone, but for those looking to give something new a try until THE DUKES OF HAZZARD is released on DVD, then IT'S ALL ABOUT LOVE is the answer.",3,CLOCK OF THE HEART,1126656000,"09 14, 2005",2005,2645,"['have', 'confess', 'only', 'reason', 'even', 'gave', 'movie', 'chance', 'was', 'description', 'back', 'featured', 'two', 'phrases', ""'d"", 'thought', ""'d"", 'never', 'see', 'together', 'one', 'movie', 'futuristic', 'apocalyptic', 'world', 'world-famous', 'ice', 'skater', 'right', 'will', 'decide', 'most', 'want', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'most', 'part', 'liked', 'what', 'saw', 'what', 'could', 'understand', 'totally', 'different', 'matter.Excellent', 'direction', 'solid', 'performances', 'why', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'movie', 'complete', 'mystery', 'completely', 'different', 'film', 'shares', 'scenes', 'cast', 'performance', 'weakest', 'play', 'headset', 'cell', 'phone', 'help', 'ground', 'lightweight', 'story', 'once', 'draw', 'end', 'distance.It', '2021', 'something', 'wrong', 'world', 'Gravity', 'acting', 'up', 'causing', 'people', 'Uganda', 'float', 'right', 'planet', 'snowing', 'July', 'have', 'be', 'careful', 'keep', 'track', 'days', 'safe', 'drink', 'water', 'do', ""n't"", 'something', 'bad', 'going', 'happen', 'something', 'wrong', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'seem', 'be', 'dropping', 'dead', 'world', 'never', 'see', 'too', 'many', 'ones', 'do', 'see', 'are', 'well', 'placed', 'realized', 'actually', 'one', 'few', 'moments', 'film', 'kind', 'raw', 'power', 'quirk', 'rest', 'film', 'shooting', 'John', 'coming', 'see', 'wife', 'Elena', 'world-famous', 'ice', 'skater', 'finalize', 'divorce', 'instead', 'falls', 'right', 'mystery.The', 'film', 'try', 'keep', 'exactly', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'most', 'part', 'do', 'very', 'well', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before', 'ghost', 'Kafka', 'here', 'rounded', 'out', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'punch', 'line', 'once', 'know', 'trick', 'movie', 'well', 'credits', 'roll', 'Once', 'get', 'lose', 'interest', 'instead', 'pulling', 'focus', 'landing', 'punches', 'be', 'fair', 'land', 'three', 'very', 'well', 'end', 'will', 'haunt', 'hour', 'two', 'film', 'opts', 'fall', 'something', 'dream', 'drifts', 'hazy', 'unsure', 'ending', 'just', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'how', 'left', 'literally', 'up', 'air.For', 'will', 'be', 'disappointment', 'others', 'looking', 'read', 'lines', 'color', 'then', 'are', 'touching', 'lyrical', 'moments', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'for.Not', 'everyone', 'looking', 'give', 'something', 'new', 'try', 'THE', 'DUKES', 'OF', 'HAZZARD', 'released', 'DVD', 'then', 'IT', 'ALL', 'ABOUT', 'LOVE', 'answer']",N/A
926522,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000ADWDFC,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 4]","In the year 2021, people in Uganda have to chain themselves to the ground because they might start to fly up in the air to their certain death. You are not safe in New York City where some people literally drop dead in the street and no one cares. Thomas Vinterberg throws his peculiar ideas into his film starring Joaquin Phoenix, Clair Danes and Sean Penn. Oh, and Penn's role is just a cameo, a traveler on the airplane perpetually mouthing philosophical soliloquy about the cosmic collapse.The film follows Joaquin Phoenix's character arriving at New York where he meets his separated wife and ice skater played by Claire Danes. Before signing the divorce paper, Danes confesses that something weird is going on, and begs him not to leave now. Dane's brother (Douglas Henshall) seems to know the truths, but he won't tell it to her.Let's face it. I couldn't understand what is going on in the film, but I do understand that `It's All Bout Love' is part thriller, part love story and part warning from the director about the humans living in modern society. The film tires to be all of them and becomes none. To their credit, the cast (not all of them) and the crew did a good job. Claire Danes is impressive showing effectively the vulnerable personality of her character, and the photography is stunningly beautiful.You may say this kind of film requires intelligence or literacy. I know some films use symbolism or metaphor, but I don't see anything symbolic or meaningful in the absurd concept of the flying Ugandans. Maybe by introducing these people or Sean Penn's character in the plane the film wants to suggest that we have lost our roots and our lost souls are hovering in the air. Or maybe it is about our inability to communicate to each other. Speaking of which, however, film is, I think, also a media based on communication between filmmakers and audiences, and for all its ambitious and novel concepts, Thomas Vinterberg's film seems to forget we need to connect to the world it tries to describe.",2,"Thought-Provoking It Is, But Hard to Find What Kind of Thought It Is",1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,2016,"['year', '2021', 'people', 'Uganda', 'have', 'chain', 'ground', 'might', 'start', 'fly', 'up', 'air', 'certain', 'death', 'are', 'not', 'safe', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'people', 'literally', 'drop', 'dead', 'street', 'one', 'Thomas', 'Vinterberg', 'peculiar', 'ideas', 'film', 'starring', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Clair', 'Danes', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Oh', 'Penn', 'role', 'just', 'cameo', 'traveler', 'airplane', 'perpetually', 'mouthing', 'philosophical', 'soliloquy', 'cosmic', 'collapse.The', 'film', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'character', 'arriving', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'separated', 'wife', 'ice', 'skater', 'played', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'signing', 'divorce', 'paper', 'Danes', 'something', 'weird', 'going', 'not', 'leave', 'now', 'Dane', 'brother', 'Douglas', 'Henshall', 'know', 'truths', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'her.Let', 'face', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'film', 'do', 'understand', 'Bout', 'Love', 'part', 'thriller', 'part', 'love', 'story', 'part', 'warning', 'director', 'humans', 'living', 'modern', 'society', 'film', 'tires', 'be', 'none', 'credit', 'cast', 'not', 'crew', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'impressive', 'showing', 'effectively', 'vulnerable', 'personality', 'character', 'photography', 'stunningly', 'beautiful.You', 'may', 'say', 'kind', 'film', 'intelligence', 'literacy', 'know', 'films', 'use', 'symbolism', 'metaphor', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'symbolic', 'meaningful', 'absurd', 'concept', 'flying', 'Ugandans', 'Maybe', 'introducing', 'people', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'character', 'plane', 'film', 'suggest', 'have', 'lost', 'roots', 'lost', 'souls', 'are', 'hovering', 'air', 'maybe', 'inability', 'communicate', 'other', 'Speaking', 'however', 'film', 'think', 'also', 'media', 'based', 'communication', 'filmmakers', 'audiences', 'ambitious', 'novel', 'concepts', 'Thomas', 'Vinterberg', 'film', 'forget', 'need', 'connect', 'world', 'describe']",N/A
