607231,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JLW5,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 1]","This was a very good documentary.  I have read several scathing reviews on this film, but for my wife and me, we enjoyed it.  Living in a small town that does not have the luxury of a comedy club, it really impressed us to see very famous comedians still getting up on the small stage to tone, build, and master their craft.  I understand that this probably doesn't happen every day in NYC and that there are months that go by without anyone famous walking into the club, but just imagine sitting there enjoying an adult beverage, and in comes Jerry wanting to explain the ludicrousness of life.  To me that would be amazing.  To get back to the documentary though, I realize that this is a prime example of staging in the documentary world.  I know that these were not random events, but instead set up to show the ""birth"" of a joke.  For that, I think it angered some people, for me, and only in this film, did it work.  What I think was to show the hardships of being a comedian in today's society, actually transformed into giving Jerry Seinfeld this platform to show his ability, his human nature, and his hardships of building a new act.  It is a rather humbling experience, as we get to see this very human person unfold before our eyes.  We can feel the tension that he feels before every show, the nerves that we would think would be non-existent with a person like Jerry, is actually still alive and kicking.  It is a beautiful film that perfectly captures the world of which I knew nothing about.What I was very impressed with in this documentary is that they were able to find someone that was a direct opposite of Jerry and give us a direct counter-point to the stand-up world.  That person, Orny Adams, perhaps revealed too much about himself, which only hurt his ability in the long run.  Whereas Jerry seemed very open to the audience, very approachable to everyone, Orny was in the game for the money, wealth, and power only.  You can see this whenever someone talks during one of Orny's shows.  It is always good to be proud of what you do, but never hurt the people that decide your fate.  It is always the audience's response that will make or break you as a comedian, and I never felt that Orny understood this.  Jerry did, and that is why his shows seemed to always be better received.  Sure, he was Jerry Seinfeld, but even when he was making fun of someone, it seemed in jest, and not anger.  With Orny, it was anger.I normally do not do this, but I would also like to give credit to those that designed this DVD.  It was literally packed with extras that only helped build more excitement for this film.  For example, you cannot help but laugh at Martin Short and his portrayal of Jiminy Glick.  You also cannot help but laugh at the way that he interviews his guests.  This was just another budding example of how well Jerry can take a joke, and how Orny just will never succeed in this business.  Glick plays off with Jerry, continually insulting and praising at the same time.  With Orny, it is nothing but insults, and I don't think Orny understands this.  He has no respect for the field or the profession, and actually gives it this very dark cloud.  You are a comedian for the people, not for the wealth.  Whatever follows is great, but you need to always respect the people that put you there.  Orny will not, that is why he is not good at what he does.  But, back to the DVD, it is loaded with extras that I think are really interesting to watch.  More from Letterman and the notes of a joke just seemed to fit well with everything else.Overall, I was very impressed with this film.  While some will argue that it is nothing but a way to cash in on Seinfeld's status, I thought that it showed this world that is difficult, and not as easy as everyone else may think.  I went into this film not knowing much about the world of comedians, but left with a whole new respect for people in the trade (except for Orny).  I recommend this film to anyone that is looking for a good laugh or for anyone even considering getting into the comedian profession.  This is a light-hearted look into a very difficult field that is still hard even for those that have made millions from it.  I was impressed, and I think you will be as well!Grade: ***** out of *****",5,Birth of a Joke,1110412800,"03 10, 2005",2005,4283,"['was', 'very', 'good', 'documentary', 'have', 'read', 'several', 'scathing', 'reviews', 'film', 'wife', 'enjoyed', 'Living', 'small', 'town', 'not', 'have', 'luxury', 'comedy', 'club', 'really', 'impressed', 'see', 'very', 'famous', 'comedians', 'still', 'getting', 'up', 'small', 'stage', 'tone', 'build', 'master', 'craft', 'understand', 'probably', ""n't"", 'happen', 'day', 'NYC', 'are', 'months', 'go', 'anyone', 'famous', 'walking', 'club', 'just', 'imagine', 'sitting', 'there', 'enjoying', 'adult', 'beverage', 'Jerry', 'wanting', 'explain', 'ludicrousness', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'amazing', 'get', 'back', 'documentary', 'realize', 'prime', 'example', 'staging', 'documentary', 'world', 'know', 'were', 'not', 'random', 'events', 'instead', 'set', 'up', 'show', 'birth', 'joke', 'think', 'angered', 'people', 'only', 'film', 'did', 'work', 'What', 'think', 'was', 'show', 'hardships', 'being', 'comedian', 'today', 'society', 'actually', 'transformed', 'giving', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'platform', 'show', 'ability', 'human', 'nature', 'hardships', 'building', 'new', 'act', 'rather', 'humbling', 'experience', 'get', 'see', 'very', 'human', 'person', 'unfold', 'eyes', 'can', 'feel', 'tension', 'show', 'nerves', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'non-existent', 'person', 'Jerry', 'actually', 'still', 'alive', 'kicking', 'beautiful', 'film', 'perfectly', 'world', 'knew', 'nothing', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'documentary', 'were', 'able', 'find', 'someone', 'was', 'direct', 'opposite', 'Jerry', 'give', 'direct', 'counter-point', 'stand-up', 'world', 'person', 'Orny', 'Adams', 'perhaps', 'revealed', 'too', 'much', 'only', 'hurt', 'ability', 'long', 'run', 'Whereas', 'Jerry', 'seemed', 'very', 'open', 'audience', 'very', 'approachable', 'everyone', 'Orny', 'was', 'game', 'money', 'wealth', 'power', 'only', 'can', 'see', 'someone', 'talks', 'one', 'Orny', 'shows', 'always', 'good', 'be', 'proud', 'what', 'do', 'never', 'hurt', 'people', 'decide', 'fate', 'always', 'audience', 'response', 'will', 'make', 'break', 'comedian', 'never', 'felt', 'Orny', 'understood', 'Jerry', 'did', 'why', 'shows', 'seemed', 'always', 'be', 'better', 'received', 'Sure', 'was', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'making', 'fun', 'someone', 'seemed', 'jest', 'not', 'anger', 'Orny', 'was', 'anger.I', 'normally', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'give', 'credit', 'designed', 'DVD', 'was', 'literally', 'packed', 'extras', 'only', 'helped', 'build', 'more', 'excitement', 'film', 'example', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'laugh', 'Martin', 'Short', 'portrayal', 'Jiminy', 'Glick', 'also', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'laugh', 'way', 'guests', 'was', 'just', 'budding', 'example', 'how', 'well', 'Jerry', 'can', 'take', 'joke', 'how', 'Orny', 'just', 'will', 'never', 'succeed', 'business', 'Glick', 'Jerry', 'continually', 'insulting', 'praising', 'same', 'time', 'Orny', 'nothing', 'insults', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Orny', 'respect', 'field', 'profession', 'actually', 'very', 'dark', 'cloud', 'are', 'comedian', 'people', 'not', 'wealth', 'great', 'need', 'always', 'respect', 'people', 'put', 'there', 'Orny', 'will', 'not', 'why', 'not', 'good', 'what', 'back', 'DVD', 'loaded', 'extras', 'think', 'are', 'really', 'interesting', 'watch', 'More', 'Letterman', 'notes', 'joke', 'just', 'seemed', 'fit', 'well', 'everything', 'else.Overall', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'film', 'will', 'argue', 'nothing', 'way', 'cash', 'Seinfeld', 'status', 'thought', 'showed', 'world', 'difficult', 'not', 'as', 'easy', 'everyone', 'else', 'may', 'think', 'went', 'film', 'not', 'knowing', 'much', 'world', 'comedians', 'left', 'whole', 'new', 'respect', 'people', 'trade', 'Orny', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'looking', 'good', 'laugh', 'anyone', 'even', 'considering', 'getting', 'comedian', 'profession', 'light-hearted', 'look', 'very', 'difficult', 'field', 'still', 'hard', 'even', 'have', 'made', 'millions', 'was', 'impressed', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'well', 'Grade', '*****', '*****']",N/A
607232,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B00005JLW5,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[7, 8]","As others have said, this film is not a comedy, nor is it in anyway a show (like the brilliant, &quot;I'm telling you for the last time&quot;) and even if you love Jerry's material immensely, you could be forgiven for feeling a little misled.It is a very good documentary on what it takes to make it as a comedian in a very unforgiving and competetive business, and really is a film of two halves. We follow Jerry in one half of the movie as he retraces his roots, and attempts in a very short space of time to go back and work up from 10 minute Club routines, all the way to an hour long performance with completely new material. The other half of the movie has another up and coming (we think) comedian Orny Adams, and his struggles and pressures as he trys to make the big time. Unfortunately for me, despite the real &quot;fly on the wall&quot; direction, I found myself really not caring about the young Mr Adams, who appears rude, spoiled, arrogant, self absorbed and completely neurotic, and began to wonder why half the movie was dedicated to him, when the title on the box says - Jerry Seinfeld Comedian. In fact, to prove this point, one of the &quot;extra's&quot; is a short piece entitled &quot;Where is Orny Now?&quot; - considering this film was made over a year ago, and I'd never heard of him before watching, I guess you can figure out the answer.The DVD has some saving graces however, with a couple of worthy deleted scenes, movie trailers, a good commentary selection plus the Letterman performances by both of the movie stars, amongst other things. However, sadly the whole thing get's a little numbing, and although I really wanted to rate this movie better,I couldn't. Truth is, most people will buy this hoping to see Jerry and his material, and then find as I did the very frustrating habit it has of cutting from scene to scene, just as you are beginning to actually see or hear his material. I found the other comedians shown to be weak for the most part (especially Mr Adams)and tried to savor the odd glimpses of very funny material, making the best of a bad hand, so to speak. Enjoy the movie, but don't expect too many laughs.",3,A Little Misleading,1057795200,"07 10, 2003",2003,2157,"['others', 'have', 'said', 'film', 'not', 'comedy', 'anyway', 'show', 'brilliant', 'quot', ""'m"", 'telling', 'last', 'time', 'quot', 'even', 'love', 'Jerry', 'material', 'immensely', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'feeling', 'little', 'misled.It', 'very', 'good', 'documentary', 'what', 'make', 'comedian', 'very', 'unforgiving', 'competetive', 'business', 'really', 'film', 'two', 'halves', 'follow', 'Jerry', 'one', 'half', 'movie', 'roots', 'attempts', 'very', 'short', 'space', 'time', 'go', 'back', 'work', 'up', '10', 'minute', 'Club', 'routines', 'way', 'hour', 'long', 'performance', 'completely', 'new', 'material', 'other', 'half', 'movie', 'up', 'coming', 'think', 'comedian', 'Orny', 'Adams', 'struggles', 'pressures', 'make', 'big', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'real', 'quot', 'fly', 'wall', 'quot', 'direction', 'found', 'really', 'not', 'caring', 'young', 'Mr', 'Adams', 'who', 'rude', 'spoiled', 'arrogant', 'self', 'absorbed', 'completely', 'neurotic', 'began', 'wonder', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'dedicated', 'when', 'title', 'box', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'Comedian', 'fact', 'prove', 'point', 'one', 'quot', 'quot', 'short', 'piece', 'entitled', 'quot', 'Where', 'Orny', 'Now', 'quot', 'considering', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'over', 'year', 'ago', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'watching', 'guess', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'answer.The', 'DVD', 'saving', 'graces', 'however', 'couple', 'worthy', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'movie', 'trailers', 'good', 'commentary', 'selection', 'Letterman', 'performances', 'movie', 'stars', 'other', 'things', 'However', 'sadly', 'whole', 'thing', 'get', 'little', 'numbing', 'really', 'wanted', 'rate', 'movie', 'better', 'could', ""n't"", 'Truth', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'buy', 'hoping', 'see', 'Jerry', 'material', 'then', 'find', 'did', 'very', 'frustrating', 'habit', 'cutting', 'scene', 'scene', 'just', 'are', 'beginning', 'actually', 'see', 'hear', 'material', 'found', 'other', 'comedians', 'shown', 'be', 'weak', 'most', 'part', 'especially', 'Mr', 'Adams', 'tried', 'savor', 'odd', 'glimpses', 'very', 'funny', 'material', 'making', 'best', 'bad', 'hand', 'so', 'speak', 'Enjoy', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'many', 'laughs']",N/A

I know that alot of documentaries are fun, funny, sometimes exciting, and interesting.  This was none of these.I went to see the movie with my father, at the time, the only movies that seemed worthy of viewing were this, and Bowling For Columbine.  Both were not advertised much and seemed very vague in the trailers.  We chose Comedian because we were fans of Seinfeld's work on &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and of his stand-up routine.This movie had very bad picture and sound quality, not that much of a problem unless you're watching it in a thaeter with LOUD SPEAKERS for LOUD SOUND.  Also, we were expecting to hear jokes, and stuff about jokes and comedy.  Each joke was cut off right before the punchline, leaving us hanging with an empty joke or story-joke.  Jerry and &quot;Orny&quot;'s talking was at times, barely audible, incoherent, or just not interesting.  Ray Romano and Jerry Seinfeld managed to sneak a funny joke or two into the movie, the rest were cut off.We didn't even wait for the movie to end.  This was in fact, the first movie I have EVER walked out of.  Luckily, Bowling For Columbine was next door, so we snuck in there as the previews had ended, and that was a decision I will never ever regret.I am no critic, I merely speak for the semiaverage moviegoer who expects action, or mystery, or adventure, or horror, or comedy, or even one guy telling a spectacular story.

I rented it mostly expecting a documentary following Jerry. However, much of the time is spent on an up and coming comic Orney Adams. Since I write this in 2004 and he hasn't become the next Jerry I have to assume he never became big but he was the most unsettling part.  I suppose Jerry was trying to show the insecurity of a comedian trying to make it, but Orney was so arrogant... and I think in need of medication it really bugged me each time he came on.  He seemed manic, indicating how little he slept, and being prone to tremendous highs and lows.It was such a contrast also... Jerry clearly enjoys telling jokes and being a comedian, while Orney seemed to hate his job. I even think that came through in his comedy act -- which seemed to come accross as angry. Although I did think he was very funny.Overall I think the documentary was good. Many times I was going to turn it off but I never ended up doing it.

It used to get on my nerves ('honey, life is not a Seinfeld episode' I would tell her) and it took me some time to warm up to the show.  After all, the characters are really just neurotic, selfish, and insensitive to anybody and everybody (which, ironically, is the shows saving grace).  But it obviously worked because it was successful and is funny.  In the later years it got to be a bit over the top and lost its charm.  And it is this that Seinfeld realized.  I believe this is why he wanted to get back to standup.Seinfeld attempted, apparently quite live before the camera, what few comedians do.  He wiped out his material that had taken him so many years to develop.  He literally scratched it and began anew.  It is this aspect that is most intriguing about the film.  We see Seinfeld forget his material, we see him performing in small clubs and we see very human emotions eminate from him in regards to actually struggling to begin again.  In a paradox, his status helps him get in the doors of clubs that no names would have a difficult time getting into but his big name also works against him in terms of expectation.  You really can't go back again.  But it gives great insight into what makes him so unique and so good at comedy.  It really is serious business.I give this four stars because Orny, the other comedian shown in the film, is just plain annoying.  I never found him funny and his neuroses are so over the top and so out in the open that it becomes painful to watch him.  I don't know if that was the point or if they merely had to include him because they had followed him for so long.  Either way, it's a drag.  Perhaps I am being too harsh and it does provide another view into what it's like to rise from being nobody to actually making a name for yourself in the comedy circuit.If you are interested in what's behind the Seinfeld mystique, it's a great place to visit.  Cameo appearacnes by other famous comedians adds to the film's depth.  These are very real people and it's refreshing.  It's not polished and it isn't Seinfeld the sitcom.

607236,A34PAZQ73SL163,B00005JLW5,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[6, 7]","Despite the confidence that most comedians project, this documentary showcases the fact that these often brilliant performers suffer from the same type of maladies as the rest of us. They are filled with anxiety, irritability, and ambition. By focusing on a legend, Jerry Seinfeld, and an unknown, Orny Adams, the audience discerns some of these characteristics and others which result in greatness on the stage. Examples evident are the need for compulsive attention to detail along with personal obsession over delivery and rehearsal. It's hard to imagine anyone going anywhere in that business without the concentrated efforts we witness here. It's surprising to find Adams watching tapes of himself and filling notebooks copiously with jokes and material.Seinfeld is probably the most talented comedian that I've ever seen, but I never had any idea just how much effort he puts into his work. He labors for six months building, writing and performing until he becomes confident in the new shtick he has created. Even then we find that he is not satisfied. He is an intense perfectionist as is Adams, but the younger man is far less healthy than Seinfeld. Jerry may joke about neurosis but Adams appears to be the genuine article. He is oversensitive, self-doubting, agitated, abrasive, and fairly depressed, yet in every scene he tries to sell us on why he is so great. He doesn't really believe it and neither do we. When George Shapiro decides to represent him, he tells Adams something to the effect of that he's going to be a big success but will forever remain unhappy. Without knowing him well, Shapiro has already mastered his client. After Adams laments to Seinfeld that he has not made it, the genius puts it all in perfect perspective by asking him what exactly what he'd rather be doing with his life.

It's actually a glimpse into the business of entertaining and the process behind making an audience laugh. &quot;Comedian&quot; is a funny movie, but it's really more about the humor of anxiety and self-doubt than punch lines.Shot on digital video by Christian Charles (who directed Seinfeld's snappy American Express commercials) and crammed with excellent jazz and pop music, the movie follows Seinfeld and a young comic named Orny Adams as they hit the road, work on new material and perform on &quot;Late Night With David Letterman.&quot; Adams -- keyed-up and hypersensitive -- doesn't fare as well as Jerry but given that he's sharing space in a movie with one of the most popular television personalities in history, he kind of has the deck stacked against him.And yes, Seinfeld, after being out of the spotlight for a while, does remain an interesting personality, even more so when caught on a relatively candid camera (Jerry curses?). His backstage conversations with Leno, Cosby, Rock and Colin Quinn reveal a guarded camaraderie, and fans who spent a significant chunk of the '90s chuckling at the misadventures of Jerry, George, Kramer and Elaine will probably find it amusing that Seinfeld still actively worries he'll bomb in front of a crowd.But for all Seinfeld's agonized fretting over writing jokes and winning the audience's approval, anybody who puts in 40-plus hours a week at an office probably won't find much sympathy for a guy who has been given hundreds of millions of dollars doing the very thing he loves to do.Nevertheless, &quot;Comedian&quot; is a sharp, insightful, wry and occasionally stinging piece of business.",4,a sharp and stinging piece of business,1063065600,"09 9, 2003",2003,2075,"['quot', 'Comedian', 'quot', 'chronicles', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'return', 'comedy', 'club', 'circuit', 'dismantling', 'sitcom', '1998', 'retiring', 'well-honed', 'live', 'routines', 'HBO', 'special', 'quot', ""'m"", 'Telling', 'Last', 'Time.', 'quot', 'documentary', 'lots', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'appearances', 'comics', 'such', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'Garry', 'Shandling', 'Robert', 'Klein', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'not', 'really', 'concert', 'movie', 'actually', 'glimpse', 'business', 'entertaining', 'process', 'making', 'audience', 'laugh', 'quot', 'Comedian', 'quot', 'funny', 'movie', 'really', 'more', 'humor', 'anxiety', 'self-doubt', 'punch', 'lines.Shot', 'digital', 'video', 'Christian', 'Charles', 'who', 'directed', 'Seinfeld', 'snappy', 'American', 'Express', 'commercials', 'crammed', 'excellent', 'jazz', 'pop', 'music', 'movie', 'Seinfeld', 'young', 'comic', 'named', 'Orny', 'Adams', 'hit', 'road', 'work', 'new', 'material', 'perform', 'quot', 'Late', 'Night', 'David', 'Letterman.', 'quot', 'Adams', 'keyed-up', 'hypersensitive', ""n't"", 'fare', 'as', 'well', 'Jerry', 'given', 'sharing', 'space', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'television', 'personalities', 'history', 'kind', 'deck', 'stacked', 'him.And', 'yes', 'Seinfeld', 'being', 'spotlight', 'while', 'remain', 'interesting', 'personality', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'caught', 'relatively', 'candid', 'camera', 'Jerry', 'backstage', 'conversations', 'Leno', 'Cosby', 'Rock', 'Colin', 'Quinn', 'reveal', 'guarded', 'camaraderie', 'fans', 'who', 'spent', 'significant', 'chunk', ""'90s"", 'chuckling', 'misadventures', 'Jerry', 'George', 'Kramer', 'Elaine', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'amusing', 'Seinfeld', 'still', 'actively', ""'ll"", 'bomb', 'front', 'crowd.But', 'Seinfeld', 'agonized', 'fretting', 'writing', 'jokes', 'winning', 'audience', 'approval', 'anybody', 'who', '40-plus', 'hours', 'week', 'office', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'sympathy', 'guy', 'who', 'been', 'given', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'dollars', 'doing', 'very', 'thing', 'do.Nevertheless', 'quot', 'Comedian', 'quot', 'sharp', 'insightful', 'wry', 'occasionally', 'stinging', 'piece', 'business']",N/A

Cooper ""Music Lover & Audiophile""","[0, 0]","Upon completion of his wildly successful TV show, Seinfeld took some time off to ""do nothing,"" as he said in his Letterman stand-up appearance.  He also decided to challenge himself by scrapping all the stand-up material he had used all these years and reinvent himself.  In this wonderful documentary, we watch as Seinfeld develops new material in the clubs on New York City, as well as a couple of surprise appearances at clubs around the country.  The documentary culminates with Seinfeld's first headlining appearance on a large stage.  In between, we watch the artist work on material, chat it up with fellow comics such as Colin Quinn and Chris Rock, and generally deal with the angst and doubt that is inevitable as the artist creates.  With surprising honesty, we watch Jerry bomb on stage as he forgets his train of thought, deal with hecklers, and shape his material into verbal sculpture.  It is a joy to watch this professional working without a net and taking chances to create new material.On the other side of the coin, young comic Orny Adams is shown developing his own material and looking for his ""big break.""  Other reviewers have complained about his narcissism, but I suggest that this is precisely what pushes someone to step up on a stage and tell jokes for a living.  Adams may be full of himself, but what successful entertainer isn't an egotist?  I found Adams' observations about the business of comedy to be astute, honest, and funny.Visually, there are a lot of beautiful touches in this movie - from a terrific edit sequence as Seinfeld prepares to go on stage at the DC Improv, to the stunning last shot from the stage of Oakland's Paramount Theater.  The filmmakers should be very proud of their efforts.Another note:  the extra features are generally very good here, but you cannot miss the audio commentary by Seinfeld and fellow comic Colin Quinn.  It is hilarious!Bottom line:  THIS IS NOT A STAND-UP VIDEO and the audience is better off as a result.

Marsh,"[0, 0]","&quot;Comedian&quot; may be a little hard for some viewers to take because it was shot entirely on a handheld digital camera in some of the darkest locales (NYC pubs, nightclubs, penthouses) known to man. But if you can pay attention long enough, and ignore the motion sickness induced by the camerawork, you'll find that &quot;Comedian&quot; is a riveting, almost dramatic documentary about the greatest living comedian (certainly the most successful one) who intentionally goes back to Square One with his comedy routines. Why do it, especially when money for Seinfeld is no object? That's the driving theme of the movie, and the great mystery of it.Seinfeld is, of course, Seinfeld, always charming, always elusive, though a lot more candid here than in any of his other incarnations. He allowed the documentary cameras access to a great deal of his personal process, showing us that developing good comedy is as much work for a millionaire superstar as digging a ditch is for the average joe.&quot;Comedian&quot; contrasts Seinfeld's struggle for 20 minutes of decent material with the equally up-hill battle waged by unknown comic Orny Adams, who is fueled by ego and a desire to become rich and famous. Orny isn't necessarily bad, it's just that he wants the fruits of success without first slugging it out in the trenches. One gets the feeling that Orny, if he were ever as successful as Jerry Seinfeld, would never go back on the comedy club circuit, but simply rest on his laurels. That, indeed, may be the reason he fails.&quot;Comedian&quot; is valuable because it is, in the end, about work. Sure, Seinfeld has it a little easier than the rest of us trying to make ends meet -- his t-shirts alone probably cost more than I bring home in a year -- but it's inspiring to see a genius of his level work so hard to maintain his own integrity.Also: BRING OUT &quot;SEINFELD&quot; EPISODES ON DVD!

But there are still some surprises. You are given an up-close look at Jerry with this film. But as Jerry works on his new routine and attempts to make the new jokes work by performing at small New York comedy clubs, you see that even Jerry can struggle at time. There are many cameo appearances by very famous comedians. Chris Rock, Bill Cosby, Ray Romano, Colin Quinn and Gary Shandling all make appearances. The majority of the other comedians screen time is spent telling stories about bad gigs, good gigs and funny stories. The interaction and dialogue between Seinfeld and the other comedians is perhaps the most enjoyable part of the movie.What is certainly the least enjoyable parts of the movie is every appearance by Orny Adams. Adams, a supposed comic, is very egotistical, vain and narcissistic. He seems to only care about himself and making sure people know who he is. Even legendary agent George Shapiro seems irritated by Adams at times. I admit some of Adams material is funny, but by seeing his personal side you really don't enjoy it.

607248,A2BC978GQQEA2A,B00005JLW5,Jeffrey Pidgeon,"[2, 4]","There's a built-in potential for disappointment in Comedian. The posters, DVD box art, etc. prominently feature Jerry Seinfeld, leading one to believe that it's a film with him as the sole focus. While Mr. Seinfeld is a major part of the film, Comedian both falls short of, and surpasses, the viewer's expectations.I thought the film was about Jerry Seinfeld's return to stand-up after a long and successful television career. While the film does indeed cover this, it also has a parallel story chronicling the struggles of Orny Adams, a talented up-and-comer who is shooting for his big break. It's presented with as much emphasis as Seinfeld's material, tranforming the proceedings.One is tempted to see it as a contrast: the pain of the scrabbling newcomer vs. the comfort of the experienced, wealthy veteran. But soon it becomes clear that it's painful for both of them - that a successful career can only do so much (that is to say, not much at all) to protect a comic from the stark vulnerability of getting on a stage and trying to make an audience laugh. It's always hard, and requires a great deal of work and focus to do.The true contrast is between how the performers approach their work. Mr. Adams is a knot of nervous insecurity, obsessively working and re-working his material, chattering non-stop about talk show appearences and development deals, privately scorning the audience after a perfomance falls short. Mr. Seinfeld, on the other hand, has a far better attitude. He treats the audience and his work with respect - he feels it's his job to make people laugh, and if construction workers can get up and go to work every day, than so can he, regardless of his success. If it doesn't happen, then he simply hasn't done his job.There are tense moments for Mr. Seinfeld when he forgets his material onstage, or is unsatisfied with a television appearance, but there are also calm ones. Quietly preparing backstage. Studying performances of Robert Klein and Richard Pryor at the Museum of Television and Radio. One touching moment has him gently singing to his baby before a performance. It's hard to imagine Mr. Adams doing the same. Indeed, his follow-up segment in the DVD supplement shows him looking lost and alone in a Los Angeles apartment, lamenting his television development deal, still restless and dissatisfied.Comedian is successful at describing the processes, attitudes and goals of two very different comics, as well as depicting the strenuous life on the stand-up circuit. Unfortunately, it's hard not to feel a little cheated when we don't get to see the final run of material Seinfeld has developed over the course of the film. In this regard, the film feels a bit choppy, an accumulation of sound bites that struggles to build to a goal. The DVD release has the Letterman appearances for both comics to compensate, but even this feels inadequate. Comedian splits its focus, attempting to straddle the banks of a making-of-a-concert film and a portrait of the comedy world. As such, it's successful enough to be compelling, but not quite the film it could've been.",2,"Smile, Darn Ya, Smile",1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,3100,"['built-in', 'potential', 'disappointment', 'Comedian', 'posters', 'DVD', 'box', 'art', 'etc', 'prominently', 'feature', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'leading', 'one', 'believe', 'film', 'sole', 'focus', 'Mr.', 'Seinfeld', 'major', 'part', 'film', 'Comedian', 'short', 'surpasses', 'viewer', 'expectations.I', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'return', 'stand-up', 'long', 'successful', 'television', 'career', 'film', 'indeed', 'cover', 'also', 'parallel', 'story', 'chronicling', 'struggles', 'Orny', 'Adams', 'talented', 'up-and-comer', 'who', 'shooting', 'big', 'break', 'presented', 'as', 'much', 'emphasis', 'Seinfeld', 'material', 'tranforming', 'proceedings.One', 'tempted', 'see', 'contrast', 'pain', 'scrabbling', 'newcomer', 'comfort', 'experienced', 'wealthy', 'veteran', 'soon', 'clear', 'painful', 'successful', 'career', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'say', 'not', 'much', 'protect', 'comic', 'stark', 'vulnerability', 'getting', 'stage', 'trying', 'make', 'audience', 'laugh', 'always', 'hard', 'great', 'deal', 'work', 'focus', 'do.The', 'true', 'contrast', 'how', 'performers', 'approach', 'work', 'Mr.', 'Adams', 'knot', 'nervous', 'insecurity', 'obsessively', 'working', 're-working', 'material', 'chattering', 'non-stop', 'talk', 'show', 'appearences', 'development', 'deals', 'privately', 'scorning', 'audience', 'perfomance', 'short', 'Mr.', 'Seinfeld', 'other', 'hand', 'far', 'better', 'attitude', 'audience', 'work', 'respect', 'job', 'make', 'people', 'construction', 'workers', 'can', 'get', 'up', 'go', 'work', 'day', 'so', 'can', 'regardless', 'success', ""n't"", 'happen', 'then', 'simply', ""n't"", 'done', 'job.There', 'are', 'tense', 'moments', 'Mr.', 'Seinfeld', 'when', 'material', 'onstage', 'unsatisfied', 'television', 'appearance', 'are', 'also', 'calm', 'ones', 'Quietly', 'preparing', 'backstage', 'Studying', 'performances', 'Robert', 'Klein', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'Museum', 'Television', 'Radio', 'One', 'touching', 'moment', 'gently', 'singing', 'baby', 'performance', 'hard', 'imagine', 'Mr.', 'Adams', 'doing', 'same', 'Indeed', 'follow-up', 'segment', 'DVD', 'supplement', 'looking', 'lost', 'alone', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'apartment', 'lamenting', 'television', 'development', 'deal', 'still', 'restless', 'dissatisfied.Comedian', 'successful', 'describing', 'processes', 'attitudes', 'goals', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'comics', 'as', 'well', 'depicting', 'strenuous', 'life', 'stand-up', 'circuit', 'Unfortunately', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'little', 'cheated', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'final', 'run', 'material', 'Seinfeld', 'developed', 'course', 'film', 'regard', 'film', 'bit', 'choppy', 'accumulation', 'sound', 'bites', 'build', 'goal', 'DVD', 'release', 'Letterman', 'appearances', 'comics', 'compensate', 'even', 'feels', 'inadequate', 'Comedian', 'focus', 'attempting', 'straddle', 'banks', 'making-of-a-concert', 'film', 'portrait', 'comedy', 'world', 'such', 'successful', 'enough', 'be', 'compelling', 'not', 'quite', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been']",N/A

""Jeff W.""","[2, 2]","I think what makes this film especially interesting (even if unintentional), is the stark contrast between Jerry Seinfeld, a huge success, and Orny Adams, one who is destined to fail in this business.  Seinfeld demonstrates, with true class, the hard work even a seasoned professional must endure to remain relevant in this craft.  Adams, on the other hand, demonstrates the approach not to take.  I can't imagine that he is happy with this film.  I'm sure he saw this as his ""big"" opportunity to break out (which it certainly could have been).  However, as others have noted, he repeatedly demonstrates a Narcissistic Personality Disorder that will ultimately impede his ability to make it as a comedian.  In scene after scene Adams acts like a spoiled, entitled baby who recoils in anger any time he is given any constructive criticism (by professionals no less!).  He comes across as a very angry person.  When asked, for example, to change one word in his standup routine, he rants and perseverates about it as if he was asked to murder his mother.  Ultimately this film can be viewed as a contrast between a class act and one that is destined to fail.  Have you heard any news of Adams since this film came out?

607250,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JLW5,Joe Sherry,"[5, 7]","Not a fan of Jerry Seinfeld? Don't worry, neither am I. ""Comedian"" has as its primary focus, the comedian Jerry Seinfeld. This is several years after the end of the ""Seinfeld"" sitcom and Jerry is getting back on the road as a standup comic trying out new material and working on his new act. As we know, Jerry Seinfeld is a fantastically successful man and if he wanted (or didn't want), he would never have to work another day in his life. So why do standup? Sure, this is his origins and where he came from, but it can be a tough life having to sell himself and his jokes every single performance with no chance of a redo. So, why? Jerry never directly answers this question during the movie except that he loves his work, but my answer is that creative men need to continue to work, to find an outlet for this creativity and this drive to keep performing. But that's just my guess.Jay Leno says midway through the film, to Jerry, that he couldn't do what Jerry is doing. What Leno is referring to is this film, ""Comedian"". Jerry is giving away his act. Not on stage, but to us, the viewer. Jerry is letting us see his frustrations, his struggles, and even some of his jokes as a work in progress rather than letting audiences discover the jokes for the first time. That is exactly what ""Comedian"" is. Jerry Seinfeld a struggling comic. He has a name that will get him through any door and on any stage, but it has been years since he has worked and he is trying to put together new jokes and a new routine. This is untested stuff and he is unsure if it is truly funny or if it will connect with an audience or if it will connect with many audiences. He is trying to find his rhythm.What adds to this film being so interesting is that other major comics appear in some scenes talking to Jerry. Chris Rock meets Jerry and Jerry tells Chris about his insecurity and Chris replies by telling Jerry about seeing a comic that they hadn't heard of before do a two and a half hour set, no intermission, telling joke after joke after story after joke and everything works. Chris says he felt like a fraud after seeing that comic. And this is Chris Rock! And this is Jerry Seinfeld who is having the same struggles.The other side of the coin is Orny Adams, a young (early 30's) comic who is trying to make it. He is very much full of himself and feels that he is better than everybody and better than the audience and when a crowd only politely chuckles he blames the audience as a bad audience and not that he may not have been good that day...because Orny is a professional and knows what he is doing. We see Orny begin to work with the guy who helped make Jerry Seinfeld a success. But his attitude just kills. He may be talented, but he needs an attitude check.This makes me wonder if this is what a Jerry Seinfeld or a Chris Rock or others were like on the way up the comic ladder. That it is only when you reach the level of success and then try to keep being funny with new material that you find you are unsure of your skill. And for this, ""Comedian"" gives a very insightful look into the backstage life of comics trying to hone their craft, even at a stage in their career where most people think they have it honed.I wasn't a fan of the tv show ""Seinfeld"" and I'm not sure I would love Jerry Seinfeld's comedy, and I know I already don't like Orny Adams, but I thought that ""Comedian"" is an excellent documentary look into their lives as comedians.-Joe Sherry",5,"And I never really liked ""Seinfeld""",1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,3462,"['Not', 'fan', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'am', 'Comedian', 'primary', 'focus', 'comedian', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'several', 'years', 'end', 'Seinfeld', 'sitcom', 'Jerry', 'getting', 'back', 'road', 'standup', 'comic', 'trying', 'out', 'new', 'material', 'working', 'new', 'act', 'know', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'fantastically', 'successful', 'man', 'wanted', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'work', 'day', 'life', 'So', 'why', 'do', 'standup', 'Sure', 'origins', 'where', 'came', 'can', 'be', 'tough', 'life', 'having', 'sell', 'jokes', 'single', 'performance', 'chance', 'redo', 'So', 'why', 'Jerry', 'never', 'directly', 'question', 'movie', 'work', 'answer', 'creative', 'men', 'need', 'continue', 'work', 'find', 'outlet', 'creativity', 'drive', 'keep', 'performing', 'just', 'guess.Jay', 'Leno', 'midway', 'film', 'Jerry', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'Jerry', 'doing', 'What', 'Leno', 'referring', 'film', 'Comedian', 'Jerry', 'giving', 'away', 'act', 'Not', 'stage', 'viewer', 'Jerry', 'letting', 'see', 'frustrations', 'struggles', 'even', 'jokes', 'work', 'progress', 'rather', 'letting', 'audiences', 'discover', 'jokes', 'first', 'time', 'exactly', 'what', 'Comedian', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'struggling', 'comic', 'name', 'will', 'get', 'door', 'stage', 'been', 'years', 'worked', 'trying', 'put', 'together', 'new', 'jokes', 'new', 'routine', 'untested', 'stuff', 'unsure', 'truly', 'funny', 'will', 'connect', 'audience', 'will', 'connect', 'many', 'audiences', 'trying', 'find', 'rhythm.What', 'film', 'being', 'so', 'interesting', 'other', 'major', 'comics', 'appear', 'scenes', 'talking', 'Jerry', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'meets', 'Jerry', 'Jerry', 'Chris', 'insecurity', 'Chris', 'replies', 'telling', 'Jerry', 'seeing', 'comic', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'before', 'do', 'two', 'half', 'hour', 'set', 'intermission', 'telling', 'joke', 'joke', 'story', 'joke', 'everything', 'works', 'Chris', 'felt', 'fraud', 'seeing', 'comic', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'who', 'having', 'same', 'struggles.The', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'Orny', 'Adams', 'young', 'early', '30', 'comic', 'who', 'trying', 'make', 'very', 'much', 'full', 'feels', 'better', 'everybody', 'better', 'audience', 'when', 'crowd', 'only', 'politely', 'audience', 'bad', 'audience', 'not', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'day', 'Orny', 'professional', 'what', 'doing', 'see', 'Orny', 'begin', 'work', 'guy', 'who', 'helped', 'make', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'success', 'attitude', 'just', 'kills', 'may', 'be', 'talented', 'attitude', 'check.This', 'wonder', 'what', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'others', 'were', 'way', 'comic', 'ladder', 'only', 'when', 'reach', 'level', 'success', 'then', 'try', 'keep', 'being', 'funny', 'new', 'material', 'find', 'are', 'unsure', 'skill', 'Comedian', 'very', 'insightful', 'look', 'backstage', 'life', 'comics', 'trying', 'hone', 'craft', 'even', 'stage', 'career', 'where', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'have', 'honed.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'tv', 'show', 'Seinfeld', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'love', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'comedy', 'know', 'already', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Orny', 'Adams', 'thought', 'Comedian', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'look', 'lives', 'comedians.-Joe', 'Sherry']",N/A

607252,A2OF0Z2L9STEQF,B00005JLW5,Kevin Caffrey,"[6, 7]","""Comedian"" is a fascinating documentary of Jerry Seinfeld's return to standup comedy after ending arguably the most popular tv show of all time as well as retiring all of his old material.  Although there are many funny moments in this film, it's really not a comedy - it's a documentary/""behind the scenes"" look at the work Seinfeld put into getting back into the groove of coming up with new material and performing for all different types of audiences.  Along the way, interesting conversations are documented between Seinfeld and other standup comedians including Colin Quinn, Chris Rock, Bill Cosby, Garry Shandling, Jay Leno, and many others.  The movie gives an inside look at how comedians create their sets, and how they feel about performing.  It's fascinating to watch Jerry Seinfeld, worth probably 300million dollars, driving himself to small clubs in New York City to pop in unannounced to see if he can try out his new material for an unsuspsecting audience.  One of the funniest parts of the movie is when Seinfeld must confront a noisy, talkative audience at a comedy club on Long Island, prompting him to say backstage, ""How BIG do you have to be to get people to stop talking during your set?""  Another interesting aspect of ""Comedian"" is that while it chronicles Seinfeld's return to standup, it also chronicles a younger, unknown, aspiring comedian and his struggle to become a famous comedian.  The interaction between him and more skilled, experienced comedians is awkward and captivating all at once.  I'm not a huge fan of Seinfeld - I loved his show, find a lot of his standup funny, but probably wouldn't see him live - yet I left this movie really liking it and suggesting it to everyone I know.  I highly recommend this movie if you're a fan of Seinfeld's, any of the aforementioned comedians, or shows like ""The Larry Sanders Show"" or ""Curb Your Enthusiasm.""",5,Interesting & Original Look at Comedy & Show Biz in General,1037664000,"11 19, 2002",2002,1888,"['Comedian', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'return', 'standup', 'comedy', 'ending', 'arguably', 'most', 'popular', 'tv', 'show', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'retiring', 'old', 'material', 'are', 'many', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'comedy', 'documentary/', 'scenes', 'look', 'work', 'Seinfeld', 'put', 'getting', 'back', 'groove', 'coming', 'up', 'new', 'material', 'performing', 'different', 'types', 'audiences', 'way', 'interesting', 'conversations', 'are', 'documented', 'Seinfeld', 'other', 'standup', 'comedians', 'including', 'Colin', 'Quinn', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Garry', 'Shandling', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'many', 'others', 'movie', 'inside', 'look', 'how', 'comedians', 'create', 'sets', 'how', 'feel', 'performing', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'worth', 'probably', '300million', 'dollars', 'driving', 'small', 'clubs', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'pop', 'unannounced', 'see', 'can', 'try', 'out', 'new', 'material', 'unsuspsecting', 'audience', 'One', 'funniest', 'parts', 'movie', 'when', 'Seinfeld', 'must', 'confront', 'noisy', 'talkative', 'audience', 'comedy', 'club', 'Long', 'Island', 'prompting', 'say', 'backstage', 'How', 'BIG', 'do', 'have', 'be', 'get', 'people', 'stop', 'talking', 'set', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'Comedian', 'Seinfeld', 'return', 'standup', 'also', 'younger', 'unknown', 'aspiring', 'comedian', 'struggle', 'become', 'famous', 'comedian', 'interaction', 'more', 'skilled', 'experienced', 'comedians', 'awkward', 'captivating', 'once', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Seinfeld', 'loved', 'show', 'find', 'lot', 'standup', 'funny', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'live', 'yet', 'left', 'movie', 'really', 'liking', 'suggesting', 'everyone', 'know', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Seinfeld', 'aforementioned', 'comedians', 'Larry', 'Sanders', 'Show', 'Curb', 'Enthusiasm']",N/A

Seinfeld's story:  He's retiring his old act (which culminated in that live, HBO special a few years back) and is trying out new jokes, slowly building up to a 45 minute set.  There's more stories in COMEDIAN.  Orny Adams (what a name!) is the antithesis of Seinfeld.  He's desperate for stardom.  He desires his own television show like Seinfeld. And he's the most obsessive comic you will see -- he keeps a catalog of his jokes, organized by subject, date, etc.COMEDIAN is a fascinating look at the lives of these hardworking joke-tellers.  Jeez, these have to be the hardest working guys in show business!  Everyone (including Jay Leno, who has the cushiest job on TV!) fears that they'll ""lose it"" if they don't keep doing live dates.COMEDIAN is not a laugh-riot.  In fact, it's just the opposite.  It shows that comedy is a very serious business.  It is painful to watch Seinfeld bomb onstage.  He forgets his joke!  He gets lost in the middle of it, wonders the stage trying to regain his train of thought, and consults his notes (yes!  Comics make very detailed notes for their acts).  An audience member yells out, ""Is this your first gig, love?""  Oy, you could just die!Watch COMEDIAN if you are interested in the life of a standup.  Don't expect Seinfeld doing his standup act.

In COMEDIAN we see a guy who goes back on the road to try out new material to see if he can once again reach that personal nirvana, that ultimate high, of enthralling an audience of strangers with laughter-inducing new observations.This documentary screams a central question: What drives Seinfeld?  Is it the personal challenge to see if he can do it again?  Is it an overwhelming craving to feel the waves of laughter from strangers that he interprets as love?  Or is it an attempt to discover if his rise to celebrity was a fluke. The answer is hard to pindown in this utterly absorbing documentary -- shot mostly with a hand-held consumer videocam -- that follows Seinfeld and unknown comic Orny Adams as they travel around the country to mostly small clubs to test their material. This is not a feature length concert performance, but an upclose, sometimes painful, look at the labored process of appearing spontaneously funny for a few precious minutes.Extras include hilarious Jiminy Glick interviews with Seinfeld and Adams, the full Seinfeld routine on his return to the David Letterman show, and an acerbic commentary with Seinfeld and fellow comic Colin Quinn.

While it features a sea of familiar faces - Ray Romano, Gary Shandling, Chris Rock, Jay Leno, Bill Cosby - making what turn out to be little more than cameo appearances, the film focuses almost exclusively on two figures from the comedy nightclub scene: one well known, Jerry Seinfeld, and the other an up-and-coming, potential new star named Orny Adams.  ""Comedian"" derives much of its meaning from the ironic juxtaposition of these two men.  Seinfeld is a man who has managed to achieve what, for any comedian, would be the pinnacle of success - fame, fortune and international celebrity status - yet he still finds himself riddled with personal doubts and feelings of inadequacy every time he gets up to perform on stage.  Adams, who has yet to get that ""big break,"" somehow comes across as much more cocky, arrogant and self-assured than Seinfeld - although Adams, too, confesses that he may indeed be a harsher critic of his own performance than are the members of his audience.""Comedian"" was originally shot on video and transferred to 35 MM film, a fact that accounts for the dark, blurry, grainy quality of the picture.  Most of the film's time is spent backstage with the comics as they air their views on their chosen profession, their colleagues, their personal idols, their various demons, their need to perform, their drive for perfection and their harsh, overly critical evaluation of their own skills and talents that often lead them into bouts of serious depression (Adams seems particularly prone to such reactions).  These scenes are interspersed with brief snippets of some of their stand-up routines, which, surprisingly, seem rather devoid of laughs (Seinfeld has always struck me as more funny on his TV series than he ever has been on stage).  One also notices that the world of the stand-up comic in this film is strictly an Old Boys Club.  Perhaps, we will one day be treated to a sequel entitled ""Comedienne"" to give the distaff side of the profession its due.""Comedian"" is a very short film - it runs a mere 81 minutes - and, as a result, it feels a little superficial at times and even truncated at the end.  We would like to see a bit more of the lives of these two men - Adams, in particular, seems to disappear from the film a bit prematurely - but it is a must-see for anyone interested in this unusual branch of the entertainment field.

Making your own friends laugh is one thing, because they get your humour, but making many people laugh and keep them laughing and interested in what you have to say is a very hard thing to do. You have to keep going and going. Comedian isn't all just about being funny, honestly its not that funny of a film(does have its moments), but it is very interesting once you've gotten deeper into the movie and know more of where its going with its point. Being a comedian has to be one of the hardest things to ever do, because you have to make people laugh or they wont like you and just forget you. Jerry Seinfeld is funny and very memorable due to mainly his show ""Seinfeld"". Very successful show that blew away people and really touched their funny bones. Even the big stars like Seinfeld get nervous before shows and know you have to know what you're doing, otherwise people will get bored. Comedy is hard, like it would be easier to do drama and make people cry then it is to make them laugh, comedy gets old too. You have to keep coming up with new and better material. So many people try to be funny and so many fail and are quickly forgotten. Comedian also portrays Orny Adams, a comedian in the film trying to make it big and make people laugh, I don't really find him that funny, it is very interesting what him and Jerry go through in the process of a successsful comedian. Sometimes it just doesn't work out the way they want. It's a lot of pressure to do a comedy act, this film shows how intense things can get in the comedy world. Yet, one of the best parts of the film is when Chris Rock and Seinfeld are chatting about Bill Cosby and how he was able to go a whole 2 and a half hour show and not take a break and people were not bored at all and kept laughing. Many have tried to be completely calm during a comedic performance and make people laugh the entire way through, but few have done it right and become legends of comedy with their own style and continue to have people love them for being funny. Jerry Seinfeld became very successful with comedy mainly due to ""Seinfeld"" (a brilliant show), but ""Comedian"", although not the funniest thing on earth by any means, it is very much worth a look, because it is interesting once you get what its about.

607264,A37JFQMMYQ9NWU,B00005JLW5,telefunken,"[3, 3]","I enjoyed Comedian for the glimpse of the not-so-public side of Jerry Seinfeld. I admire him for not taking the path of least resistance after his TV show ended. He could have gotten lazy and soft, making the occasional appearance on Leno and People magazine and otherwise doing not much of anything. Instead, he chose to throw away all his old material and undergo the apparently painful process of developing new routines and then polishing them in front of audiences. This film allows you to watch as the jokes don't work, as routines are completely forgotten onstage, as the audience talks and yells through his performance, and as he waits, alone, backstage, a bundle of nervous insecurity and doubt, before his performances. It does not look easy.The other part of the film that warrants comment is the striving young comic Orny Adams whose struggle to become known is contrasted with Seinfeld, whose enormous popularity precedes him. The contrast is that Seinfeld is generally a very likable guy with a lot of warmth and humanity. His humanity shows not only during his act but offstage, as he speaks to people on the street, is respectful to everyone around him, and listens when other people talk. Orny Adams, by contrast, is a titanicallyself-obsessed, massively irritating, bug-eyed motor-mouthed bore. He goes on and on about how talented he is. He complains that even though he is so talented he has to lower himself to actually perform in a comedy festival in Montreal. He obsesses about &quot;what people in LA are saying about me right now...what deals are being made?&quot;. He displays for the camera all the notebooks full of jokes that he has written as evidence of the astonishing sacrifices he has made for his career. Excuse me, aren't you a comedian? Your job is to write jokes. Don't expect a medal because you did your job. The most telling and damning moment regarding Orny comes when an acquaintance comes backstage and gives Orny some outstanding advice, i.e. stop being so stridently ambitious and arrogant and let your work speak for itself, and as soon as the guy leaves the room Ornydismisses the guy as a string of unprintable obscenities.I realize I have spent a lot of my review focusing on Orny Adams.

It turned out that this was a very interesting look at what its like to be comedian. Seinfeld has to start his act from scratch and we see how the act evolves and some behind the scenes conversations on comedy with Chris Rock and Colin Quinn. I think the most interesting conversations Jerry has are with Orny Adams (the young comic also featured in the film) and Bill Cosby. Also i thought it was kinda funny when him and Ray Romano were sitting and talking and Ray looked a little intimidated by Seinfeld and what he was trying to acheive. The movie goes back and forth between Seinfeld and Adams. The Adams portion of the movie is probably a lot more interesting because you see more of the process a comedian has to go through in order to get where Seinfeld is. Adams has some moments that seemed pretty raw and real unlike Seinfeld who always is light-hearted looking pretty confident. In some moments it looks like Adams was not aware he was being filmed. They showed some stand up from both Seinfeld and Adams but for the most part its a back stage look.,4,This is a documentary not a comedy special,1102982400,"12 14, 2004",2004,1180,"['Somebody', 'told', 'not', 'watch', 'cause', 'was', 'stupid', 'i', 'was', 'curious', 'so', 'i', 'rented', 'had', 'very', 'low', 'expectations', 'turned', 'out', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'look', 'what', 'like', 'be', 'comedian', 'Seinfeld', 'start', 'act', 'scratch', 'see', 'how', 'act', 'evolves', 'scenes', 'conversations', 'comedy', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Colin', 'Quinn', 'think', 'most', 'interesting', 'conversations', 'Jerry', 'are', 'Orny', 'Adams', 'young', 'comic', 'also', 'featured', 'film', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Also', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'kinda', 'funny', 'when', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'were', 'sitting', 'talking', 'Ray', 'looked', 'little', 'intimidated', 'Seinfeld', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'acheive', 'movie', 'back', 'forth', 'Seinfeld', 'Adams', 'Adams', 'portion', 'movie', 'probably', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'see', 'more', 'process', 'comedian', 'go', 'order', 'get', 'where', 'Seinfeld', 'Adams', 'moments', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'raw', 'real', 'Seinfeld', 'who', 'always', 'light-hearted', 'looking', 'pretty', 'confident', 'moments', 'Adams', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'was', 'being', 'filmed', 'showed', 'stand', 'up', 'Seinfeld', 'Adams', 'most', 'part', 'back', 'stage', 'look']",N/A

607268,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,B00005JLW5,wellwellwell,"[1, 4]","Do not rent or buy `Comedian' hoping for 82 minutes of Jerry Seinfeld doing his classic stand-up routines.  Because you'll really only get about half an hour of stand-up, and only half of that is from Mr. Seinfeld.  Although this documentary stars Seinfeld, it also features numerous other comedians such as Colin Quinn and Orny Adams.  What this ""movie"" is attempting to do is two things.  One: it is trying to give us (the viewer) a psychological look at how rough it is to make it in the stand-up business.  Two: Jerry Seinfeld is attempting to start from scratch with his material and make a comeback in the comedian scene.Sadly, those two aspects of the ""movie"" (it's easier to write movie than documentary) don't always clash well.  I don't think I'm alone when I say more stand-up should've been featured.  Yes, there are a number of hilarious routines, but most of them are cut short and don't quite make it past three minutes.  It's very tedious, and after one hour, you'll be wishing it was already over.  It's very clear they could've done a bit more with this.  Of the few high points within the DVD, some of the extras are rather interesting.  The interviews Seinfeld and Orny Adams did with Jiminy Glick are priceless.  And some of the deleted scenes were pretty funny.  Why they didn't include them is beyond me; the movie's only 82 minutes long to begin with.In conclusion, be tentative in purchasing this.  At least rent it first.  The movie does a decent job with backstage thoughts about preparing for stand-up, but it's deceiving because the stand-up never really takes place.  It's like they left out the climax.  Diehard Jerry Seinfeld fans will surely enjoy watching him attempt a whole new routine, but probably won't enjoy seeing much of the toffee-nosed Orny Adams.

607269,A3SO4SZPDNW0S3,B00005JLW5,William Krischke,"[40, 44]","This ends up being less a documentary about comedy and more a character study of a mature and an immature craftsman.  The craft here is comedy, but it really could be anything, especially any type of art.  A friend and I watched this and afterwards talked about how well Jerry Seinfeld and Orny Adams illustrate the principles of leadership.Jerry Seinfeld is the portrait of a mature craftsman.1.  He is able maintain a healthy separation between himself and his craft.  When a bit is not funny, it doesn't mean he isn't funny, it means the bit needs work.  So he reworks it.  When a set doesn't go well, he accepts the responsibility (doesn't ""blame it on the candles"") and figures out how to make the next set go better.2. He has a life outside of his work.  We only see his family for a few seconds; this is a film about comedy, and that's his job, not his life.3.  He views other craftsmen in his field as resources and comrades, not as threats and enemies.  It is clear Jerry has a warm relationship with other comics, most notably Colin Quinn, and is able to discuss the craft and refine material with them.  He listens to their advice, airs his concerns, and hears their concerns.  He learns more about the craft by discussing it with other craftsmen.4.  He is willing to take risks in order to make himself a better craftsman, and produce a better craft.  The real story of Jerry Seinfeld here is that he is starting over -- all new material -- in order to sharpen himself, to challenge himself and stay on top of the game.  It's a huge risk that makes him a better craftsman.Orny Adams is the portrait of an immature craftsman.1.  He is unable to maintain a healthy separation between himself and the craft.  When a set doesn't go well, Orny takes it personally.  It's like the audience is attacking is worth, his value as a person.  He believes that if he is not funny, he is worthless.  As a defense mechanism, he gets angry.  At different points in the movie, he rages at a bad audience, a bad club, and a bad time slot.2. Apparently, he has no life outside his work.  He calls his mom once, to tell her he has one a contest.  But it's clear he's unhappy, and it's quite possible it's because all he has and does and is is comedy.3. He views other craftsmen in his field as threats and enemies.  It's pretty clear that other comics respect Orny Adams, but none are his friends.  At one point in the movie, another comic tries to give him some advice -- primarily about what I noted in point #2, that he needs to have a life outside of his comedy -- but he gives it like he's giving it to a rattlesnake about to strike.  He is constantly verbally backing away, disclaiming, trying to say what he has to say without being struck.  And Orny receives it like a rattlesnake.  He cannot hear what the man has to say, and instead tells him what he ought to be saying to him.  At another point, he says he has respect for Jerry Seinfeld, but it looks more like envy to me.  He wonders at one point, if Jerry's success is not simply the result of luck.(That may be misquoted in the movie.  I got a strong sense while watching it that Orny doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut, and that the documentary editors cut pieces of his dialogue from their context to make what he says sound worse than it actually is.)4.  The prospect of taking risks with his craft makes him anxious and miserable.  He has to take a pretty minor risk when he goes on Letterman -- he has to change one key word in his set -- and it gives him fits.  He rages against the show, and is clearly a nervous wreck afterwards.  The sad thing is, the risk worked.  The bit was still funny.  But his inability to separate his craft from himself (back to #1) mean that this risk absolutely wrecked him.Orny Adams is a very talented comedian, and in all fairness, if we went back and watched Jerry Seinfeld twenty years ago, he probably would have looked much the same.  Here's hoping that he matures into a competent craftsman.  My advice to him would be to take some time off -- spend a year away from the circuit, away from comedy, so that he can establish an identity that isn't the craft.  Then come back.  If not, I have to agree with George Shapiro's words:  ""Yeah, Orny, I think you'll be big.  But I think you'll still be unhappy.""",3,A great tool for a leadership conference,1090800000,"07 26, 2004",2004,4310,"['up', 'being', 'less', 'documentary', 'comedy', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'mature', 'immature', 'craftsman', 'craft', 'here', 'comedy', 'really', 'could', 'be', 'anything', 'especially', 'type', 'art', 'friend', 'watched', 'afterwards', 'talked', 'how', 'well', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'Orny', 'Adams', 'illustrate', 'principles', 'leadership.Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'portrait', 'mature', 'craftsman.1', 'able', 'maintain', 'healthy', 'separation', 'craft', 'When', 'bit', 'not', 'funny', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'funny', 'bit', 'needs', 'work', 'When', 'set', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'responsibility', ""n't"", 'blame', 'candles', 'out', 'how', 'make', 'next', 'set', 'go', 'better.2', 'life', 'work', 'only', 'see', 'family', 'few', 'seconds', 'film', 'comedy', 'job', 'not', 'life.3', 'other', 'craftsmen', 'field', 'resources', 'comrades', 'not', 'threats', 'enemies', 'clear', 'Jerry', 'warm', 'relationship', 'other', 'comics', 'most', 'notably', 'Colin', 'Quinn', 'able', 'discuss', 'craft', 'refine', 'material', 'advice', 'airs', 'concerns', 'concerns', 'more', 'craft', 'discussing', 'other', 'craftsmen.4', 'willing', 'take', 'risks', 'order', 'make', 'better', 'craftsman', 'produce', 'better', 'craft', 'real', 'story', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'here', 'starting', 'over', 'new', 'material', 'order', 'sharpen', 'challenge', 'stay', 'top', 'game', 'huge', 'risk', 'better', 'craftsman.Orny', 'Adams', 'portrait', 'immature', 'craftsman.1', 'unable', 'maintain', 'healthy', 'separation', 'craft', 'When', 'set', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'Orny', 'personally', 'audience', 'attacking', 'worth', 'value', 'person', 'not', 'funny', 'worthless', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'angry', 'different', 'points', 'movie', 'bad', 'audience', 'bad', 'club', 'bad', 'time', 'slot.2', 'Apparently', 'life', 'work', 'mom', 'once', 'tell', 'one', 'contest', 'clear', 'unhappy', 'quite', 'possible', 'comedy.3', 'other', 'craftsmen', 'field', 'threats', 'enemies', 'pretty', 'clear', 'other', 'comics', 'respect', 'Orny', 'Adams', 'none', 'are', 'friends', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'comic', 'tries', 'give', 'advice', 'primarily', 'what', 'noted', 'point', '2', 'have', 'life', 'comedy', 'giving', 'rattlesnake', 'strike', 'constantly', 'verbally', 'backing', 'away', 'disclaiming', 'trying', 'say', 'what', 'say', 'being', 'struck', 'Orny', 'rattlesnake', 'can', 'not', 'hear', 'what', 'man', 'say', 'instead', 'what', 'ought', 'be', 'saying', 'point', 'respect', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'more', 'like', 'envy', 'one', 'point', 'Jerry', 'success', 'not', 'simply', 'result', 'luck', 'may', 'be', 'misquoted', 'movie', 'got', 'strong', 'sense', 'watching', 'Orny', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'keep', 'mouth', 'shut', 'documentary', 'editors', 'cut', 'pieces', 'dialogue', 'context', 'make', 'what', 'sound', 'worse', 'actually', '4', 'prospect', 'taking', 'risks', 'craft', 'anxious', 'miserable', 'take', 'pretty', 'minor', 'risk', 'when', 'Letterman', 'change', 'one', 'key', 'word', 'set', 'fits', 'show', 'clearly', 'nervous', 'wreck', 'afterwards', 'sad', 'thing', 'risk', 'worked', 'bit', 'was', 'still', 'funny', 'inability', 'separate', 'craft', 'back', '1', 'mean', 'risk', 'absolutely', 'wrecked', 'him.Orny', 'Adams', 'very', 'talented', 'comedian', 'fairness', 'went', 'back', 'watched', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'much', 'same', 'Here', 'hoping', 'competent', 'craftsman', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'take', 'time', 'off', 'spend', 'year', 'away', 'circuit', 'away', 'comedy', 'can', 'establish', 'identity', ""n't"", 'craft', 'Then', 'come', 'back', 'not', 'have', 'agree', 'George', 'Shapiro', 'words', 'Yeah', 'Orny', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'big', 'think', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'unhappy']",N/A
