I like purchasing Christian films just to see what is out there.  This movie is just confusing.  There are alot of irish sayings that add to the movie; however, I just don't get them.  Also from what I understand, one of the main characters dies in the movie, and the little boy believes there is a sign from heaven that the man went to see God.  However, the man was never saved so I did not quite get this.  The movie really does not provide an ending for the main character.  Also the movie had a few curse words in it.  If I am not mistaken, one teenager said f--k in the movie.  He was fussed at for using this word; however, a christian movie dropping a f-bomb is really not my favorite thing to watch.  I mean there were only like two curse words in the movie; however, the movie really does not make a good enough point to me to make it worth those two words.",2,I really don't understand this movie,1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,977,"['bought', 'movie', 'was', 'recommended', 'flier', 'get', 'nationwide', 'christian', 'book', 'store', 'purchasing', 'Christian', 'films', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'movie', 'just', 'confusing', 'are', 'alot', 'irish', 'sayings', 'add', 'movie', 'however', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Also', 'what', 'understand', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'dies', 'movie', 'little', 'boy', 'sign', 'heaven', 'man', 'went', 'see', 'God', 'However', 'man', 'was', 'never', 'saved', 'so', 'did', 'not', 'quite', 'get', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'provide', 'ending', 'main', 'character', 'Also', 'movie', 'had', 'few', 'curse', 'words', 'am', 'not', 'mistaken', 'one', 'teenager', 'said', 'f', 'k', 'movie', 'was', 'fussed', 'using', 'word', 'however', 'christian', 'movie', 'dropping', 'f-bomb', 'really', 'not', 'favorite', 'thing', 'watch', 'mean', 'were', 'only', 'like', 'two', 'curse', 'words', 'movie', 'however', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'enough', 'point', 'make', 'two', 'words']",48 Angels
