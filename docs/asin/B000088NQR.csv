735102,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B000088NQR,Ace-of-Stars,"[4, 8]","*Although it upsets me somewhat that this DVD is being released by Universal Studios (which will more than likely result in them plastering their own corporate logo at the opening and ending credits and likely removing the original Japanese studio logos and credits), I am most pleased that FINALLY they are going to offer this original masterpiece in a crisp, high quality ''Region-1'' DVD!Previously, when DreamWorks SKG purchased the rights to remake their American version of this film (as ''The Ring''), they subsequently pressured other distributors to discontinue marketing ''Regionless'' DVDs of this original Japanese title out of fear that we here in the US just might get our hands on our own personal copies of the original film and BYPASS the American remake in theatres (...and judging from what I have seen for myself and have heard from others about how much Verbinski's remake deviated from the original, it would seem that the studio exec's fears were clearly justified).  So, until now, the only way this title could have been acquired in the US was on VCD (which are about as fun as those old ''laserdiscs'') or pirated DVDs. So I have high hopes for this ''official'' American release DVD!If no one has yet seen the DreamWorks remake, I would strongly suggest holding off on that idea UNTIL you have first experienced this movie in its original spectacle! Many people will say this movie is ''scary,'' but that's not really true; it is more ''creepy'' and ''sinister'' than anything else -- but it has ALL of the trappings of a truly good eerie and spooky movie: dark lighting, creepy sets, moody film score, subdued acting, an easy-pace, and suspenseful script.If you have already been ''polluted'' with the Verbinski version, there's a good possibility you may not like this version, precisely for of the very reasons I have just mentioned. Not only does the DreamWorks/Verbinski project ''brighten'' things up to eliminate the dark & eerie look and feel of the original film, but it also tacks on a lot of extra stuff and details which (though perhaps present in the Japanese prequel and alternative sequels) were NOT present nor expressed in this Original film. [[For further details, see my Amazon DVD review of ''THE RING'' under the heading: ''BEFORE YOU SEE 'The Ring' ... SEE THE 'ORIGINAL'!'']] But even if you have seen the DreamWorks fare and felt that somehow it could have been better or should have been handled differently, then THIS is the movie that is going to make you want to kick yourself for believing the hype and wasting nine bucks & time spent in line at the movie theatre -- and on top of that, the popcorn was stale._",5,"If You Want to See ""The Ring,"" THIS IS THE ONE TO GET!",1043539200,"01 26, 2003",2003,2666,"['somewhat', 'DVD', 'being', 'released', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'result', 'plastering', 'own', 'corporate', 'logo', 'opening', 'ending', 'credits', 'likely', 'removing', 'original', 'Japanese', 'studio', 'logos', 'credits', 'am', 'most', 'pleased', 'FINALLY', 'are', 'going', 'offer', 'original', 'masterpiece', 'crisp', 'high', 'quality', 'Region-1', 'DVD', 'Previously', 'when', 'DreamWorks', 'SKG', 'purchased', 'rights', 'remake', 'American', 'version', 'film', 'Ring', 'subsequently', 'pressured', 'other', 'distributors', 'discontinue', 'marketing', 'Regionless', 'DVDs', 'original', 'Japanese', 'title', 'fear', 'here', 'US', 'just', 'might', 'get', 'hands', 'own', 'personal', 'copies', 'original', 'film', 'BYPASS', 'American', 'remake', 'theatres', 'judging', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'heard', 'others', 'how', 'much', 'Verbinski', 'remake', 'deviated', 'original', 'would', 'seem', 'studio', 'exec', 'fears', 'were', 'clearly', 'justified', 'So', 'now', 'only', 'way', 'title', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'acquired', 'US', 'was', 'VCD', 'are', 'as', 'fun', 'old', 'laserdiscs', 'pirated', 'DVDs', 'So', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'official', 'American', 'release', 'DVD', 'one', 'yet', 'seen', 'DreamWorks', 'remake', 'would', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'holding', 'off', 'idea', 'UNTIL', 'have', 'first', 'experienced', 'movie', 'original', 'spectacle', 'Many', 'people', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'scary', 'not', 'really', 'true', 'more', 'creepy', 'sinister', 'anything', 'else', 'trappings', 'truly', 'good', 'eerie', 'spooky', 'movie', 'dark', 'lighting', 'creepy', 'sets', 'moody', 'film', 'score', 'subdued', 'acting', 'easy-pace', 'suspenseful', 'script.If', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'polluted', 'Verbinski', 'version', 'good', 'possibility', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'version', 'precisely', 'very', 'reasons', 'have', 'just', 'mentioned', 'Not', 'only', 'DreamWorks/Verbinski', 'project', 'brighten', 'things', 'up', 'eliminate', 'dark', 'eerie', 'look', 'feel', 'original', 'film', 'also', 'lot', 'extra', 'stuff', 'details', 'perhaps', 'present', 'Japanese', 'prequel', 'alternative', 'sequels', 'were', 'NOT', 'present', 'expressed', 'Original', 'film', '[', '[', 'further', 'details', 'see', 'Amazon', 'DVD', 'review', 'RING', 'heading', 'YOU', 'SEE', ""'The"", 'Ring', 'SEE', ""'ORIGINAL"", ']', ']', 'even', 'have', 'seen', 'DreamWorks', 'fare', 'felt', 'somehow', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'differently', 'then', 'THIS', 'movie', 'going', 'make', 'want', 'kick', 'believing', 'hype', 'wasting', 'nine', 'bucks', 'time', 'spent', 'line', 'movie', 'theatre', 'top', 'popcorn', 'was', 'stale._']",N/A

It shows, that a horror movie can do very well without big budget and CGI.Here we don't have shock scenes or something frightfull jumping at the screen - the trademarks of American horror movies. What we have is atmosphere and mood turned to tne highest degree possible. In some way it can be compared to Blair Witch Project. Not the plot, but the feeling of impending doom hanging above the characters.Ringu 2 and Ringu 0 are also interesting, adding to the story. While 2 is reminiscent of the original Ringu, it's still a good thriller, not just repetition of the same material.The Spiral is another story. It was the first sequel for immensely popular Ringu, but dissapointed fans immensely, and so Ringu 2 was made instead.

735104,A2PUYMR4W89GUY,B000088NQR,Amanda,"[1, 1]","I was going to try and review ""Ringu"" without doing a compare and contrast with its American remake, ""The Ring"". However, it is very hard to do, especially since most people who check this film out have most likely seen ""The Ring"", and want to compare it to the original. One reviewer said your favorite of the two probably depends on which one you saw first. I'd probably have to agree. I saw ""The Ring"" first.""Ringu"", without comparing it to ""The Ring"", stands very well on its own. It's really the first foreign film I've seen that is a horror movie, and it was made quite well. The idea is original - a cursed videotape that gives everyone who watches it a seven-day death sentence. While investigating the mysterious death of her niece, a young reporter stumbles upon this tape and has seven days to figure out where it came from, what it means, and how to lift the curse that's on it.Okay, now that we have the plot, here is the compare and contrast: There are a number of scenes in ""Ringu"" that are nearly mirrored in ""The Ring"", but other than that, there are quite a few differences. First of all, the tape. The tape in ""Ringu"" is a lot shorter than the one in ""The Ring"" - and a lot less creepy. Watching the tape in the latter, I was left with an unsettling feeling, which I believe was the purpose of it; in ""Ringu"", it didn't creep me out nearly as much. However, a lot of things were added to the one in ""The Ring"", and some of the images don't seem to make sense, whereas ""Ringu"" just cuts to the chase. ""Ringu"" seems like a brighter film; there are even a few scenes outside in the sun. ""The Ring"" was far more dark and gloomy, which I thought made it seem creepier. However, despite the fact that ""Ringu"" is a little more than an hour and a half, and ""The Ring"" was nearly two hours, ""Ringu"" managed to explain itself better. I was completely confused after watching ""The Ring"", and was still confused after ""Ringu"", but the original seemed to make more sense. Neither really explained how the tape came into existence, or why it is cursed, but ""Ringu"" explained the last scene better. I still don't get it, but maybe I'm not supposed to. Visually, ""The Ring"" is better, mainly because of the bigger budget. Still, ""Ringu"" looks pretty good, too.""Ringu"" and ""The Ring"" are the same, yet completely different. I have to wonder what I would have thought of ""Ringu"" had I seen it before ""The Ring"". Would I have liked it more? It's hard to tell. I like both films, but in the end, I think ""The Ring"" is the version that is going to stick with me the most. I know, I know, it was strictly Hollywood, with a big budget and a lot of hype, with more special effects; I just think that ""The Ring"" took the great idea from the original, took its spookiness and turned it into something even better. But without ""Ringu"", ""The Ring"" would have never existed. I guess that says a lot about the original. If you liked ""The Ring"", I recommend you check this one out. Maybe rent it first, just to make sure. It's always fun to compare remakes with the original (another good one: ""Vanilla Sky"" vs. ""Open Your Eyes""). But no matter which one you like more, you will still probably want to sleep with the lights on.",4,Creepy in its Own Respect,1047081600,"03 8, 2003",2003,3215,"['was', 'going', 'try', 'review', 'Ringu', 'doing', 'compare', 'contrast', 'American', 'remake', 'Ring', 'However', 'very', 'hard', 'do', 'especially', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'check', 'film', 'out', 'have', 'most', 'likely', 'seen', 'Ring', 'want', 'compare', 'original', 'One', 'reviewer', 'said', 'favorite', 'two', 'probably', 'depends', 'one', 'saw', 'first', ""'d"", 'probably', 'have', 'agree', 'saw', 'Ring', 'first', 'Ringu', 'comparing', 'Ring', 'very', 'well', 'own', 'really', 'first', 'foreign', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'horror', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'quite', 'well', 'idea', 'original', 'cursed', 'videotape', 'everyone', 'who', 'seven-day', 'death', 'sentence', 'investigating', 'mysterious', 'death', 'niece', 'young', 'reporter', 'tape', 'seven', 'days', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'came', 'what', 'how', 'lift', 'curse', 'it.Okay', 'now', 'have', 'plot', 'here', 'compare', 'contrast', 'are', 'number', 'scenes', 'Ringu', 'are', 'nearly', 'mirrored', 'Ring', 'other', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'differences', 'First', 'all', 'tape', 'tape', 'Ringu', 'lot', 'shorter', 'one', 'Ring', 'lot', 'less', 'creepy', 'Watching', 'tape', 'latter', 'was', 'left', 'unsettling', 'feeling', 'believe', 'was', 'purpose', 'Ringu', 'did', ""n't"", 'creep', 'out', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'However', 'lot', 'things', 'were', 'added', 'one', 'Ring', 'images', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'sense', 'Ringu', 'just', 'cuts', 'chase', 'Ringu', 'brighter', 'film', 'are', 'even', 'few', 'scenes', 'sun', 'Ring', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'thought', 'made', 'seem', 'creepier', 'However', 'fact', 'Ringu', 'little', 'more', 'hour', 'half', 'Ring', 'was', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'Ringu', 'managed', 'explain', 'better', 'was', 'completely', 'confused', 'watching', 'Ring', 'was', 'still', 'confused', 'Ringu', 'original', 'seemed', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'really', 'explained', 'how', 'tape', 'came', 'existence', 'why', 'cursed', 'Ringu', 'explained', 'last', 'scene', 'better', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'not', 'supposed', 'Visually', 'Ring', 'better', 'mainly', 'bigger', 'budget', 'Still', 'Ringu', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'Ringu', 'Ring', 'are', 'same', 'yet', 'completely', 'different', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Ringu', 'had', 'seen', 'Ring', 'Would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'hard', 'tell', 'films', 'end', 'think', 'Ring', 'version', 'going', 'stick', 'most', 'know', 'know', 'was', 'strictly', 'Hollywood', 'big', 'budget', 'lot', 'hype', 'more', 'special', 'effects', 'just', 'think', 'Ring', 'took', 'great', 'idea', 'original', 'took', 'spookiness', 'turned', 'something', 'even', 'better', 'Ringu', 'Ring', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'existed', 'guess', 'lot', 'original', 'liked', 'Ring', 'recommend', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'Maybe', 'rent', 'first', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'always', 'fun', 'compare', 'remakes', 'original', 'good', 'one', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'Open', 'Eyes', 'matter', 'one', 'more', 'will', 'still', 'probably', 'want', 'sleep', 'lights']",N/A

I thought the American version went too far in trying to make Samara into some sort of freak of nature--her unnatural conception, her ability to create pictures not only on video but on walls, and her strange effect on horses--but none of that was in the Japanese version, and I don't think it needed to be. It actually makes it scarier that we don't know very much about Sadako, except that she could kill people by wishing it. Other than that, she seems to have been a normal girl, which makes it all the more tragic that she was murdered. We don't feel much sympathy for Samara, since she was a monster.There are still some questions I have about the storyline that are answered by neither version, such as how Sadako/Samara could utilize a technology that hadn't even been invented in her lifetime; and since she appears to come from the TV, how did she kill the kids in the car?

Almquist ""art_the_movie_critic""","[9, 10]","I'm glad to see that some of the reviews posted here point out that both &quot;Ringu&quot; and &quot;The Ring&quot; are very successful, and that to compare them is to be ignore the merits of both pictures.Since more readers will have seen the remake, I do want to encourage viewers who haven't caught &quot;Ringu&quot; to do so for three major reasons: first, the spirit's motivations and roots are clearer while still maintaining the story's eerie ambiguity.  It moves beyond the &quot;Just because she's evil&quot; realm.  Second, the last choice made by the main character (dropped in the remake, my guess because it was thought too disturbing for an American audience) is brilliantly horrifying, and brings to life human frailty and the lengths desperation will take us.  And finally, because the finale, in which spirit and human meet face to face, is one of the most unsettling things I've ever seen in a film ... and I love being unsettled, so I've seen a lot of unsettling scenes.  The remake's version is also plenty effective, but the way the scene is filmed here - with something to suggest stop motion - will stay with me forever ... as will those fingernails.A great film, not to be missed by genre fans.",5,One of the most unsettling finales ever,1059264000,"07 27, 2003",2003,1218,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'reviews', 'posted', 'here', 'point', 'out', 'quot', 'Ringu', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'are', 'very', 'successful', 'compare', 'be', 'ignore', 'merits', 'pictures.Since', 'more', 'readers', 'will', 'have', 'seen', 'remake', 'do', 'want', 'encourage', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'caught', 'quot', 'Ringu', 'quot', 'do', 'so', 'three', 'major', 'reasons', 'first', 'spirit', 'motivations', 'roots', 'are', 'clearer', 'still', 'maintaining', 'story', 'eerie', 'ambiguity', 'quot', 'Just', 'evil', 'quot', 'realm', 'Second', 'last', 'choice', 'made', 'main', 'character', 'dropped', 'remake', 'guess', 'was', 'thought', 'too', 'disturbing', 'American', 'audience', 'brilliantly', 'horrifying', 'life', 'human', 'frailty', 'lengths', 'desperation', 'will', 'take', 'finally', 'finale', 'spirit', 'human', 'meet', 'face', 'face', 'one', 'most', 'unsettling', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'love', 'being', 'unsettled', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'unsettling', 'scenes', 'remake', 'version', 'also', 'plenty', 'effective', 'way', 'scene', 'filmed', 'here', 'something', 'suggest', 'stop', 'motion', 'will', 'stay', 'forever', 'will', 'fingernails.A', 'great', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'genre', 'fans']",N/A
735107,A1OUEDUZ4AHVIZ,B000088NQR,"Ben Stubbs ""Horror / Metal Enthusiast""","[6, 6]","""Ringu"" came out back in 1998 and caused quite a stir. It's really the film that kicked off the run of Asian horror movies that have since garnered a massive following and become the inspiration for umpteen American remakes. I think I'm one of the fortunate ones that picked up on the sensation early enough and saw ""Ringu"" long before the remake was released. Those who watch them in reverse order may be a little disappointed as they simply lose out on the effect that this unique (at the time) experience held. I'm not suggesting that ""Ringu"" isn't worth viewing. It just has flaws that the creators of the remake were generally able to rectify and having the knowledge of what happens at the end definitely takes away from the result.The plot involves a videotape containing bizarre and creepy imagery. When someone watches the tape, they immediately receive a phone call and the countdown begins. They will die in seven days! The reasons for this are completely unclear for the majority of the film, but the main characters (who are attempting to save their own lives after watching the tape) slowly unravel the mystery to discover who is behind the curse and why. When I first heard this plot I thought it was stupid. Describing it to friends that haven't seen it still gets the same response. Yet ""Ringu"" is convincing enough to really get under your skin. The tape really is creepy for starters! It's far shorter than in the remake, yet the combination of grating sounds and atmospheric visuals that you just can't quite figure out works really well. The music in the film is minimal to say the least and it really only kicks in when something scary or important occurs. It's certainly not utilized for shock value like in so many American movies these days which is a breath of fresh air. Without a doubt though, it's the shocking finale that the viewer will never forget. I nearly soiled myself on first viewing and I consider myself to be a fairly difficult person to scare.As for which version is better, well in most cases I find remakes fairly pointless exercises and nearly always disappointing. Yet ""The Ring"" is in my opinion far superior to ""Ringu"" for the following reasons. The acting is much better, the story doesn't rely on one of the main characters being able to read minds to unravel, and there's a whole heap of new background information on the characters involved. But even with all these flaws, I still really enjoy ""Ringu"" and suggest fans of the remake check it out to see where the whole thing started. If you haven't seen either, I highly recommend watching the Japanese version first for full appreciation.",4,Highly influential and creepy film that's enjoyable despite its flaws.,1162512000,"11 3, 2006",2006,2641,"['Ringu', 'came', 'out', 'back', '1998', 'caused', 'quite', 'stir', 'really', 'film', 'kicked', 'off', 'run', 'Asian', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'garnered', 'massive', 'following', 'become', 'inspiration', 'umpteen', 'American', 'remakes', 'think', ""'m"", 'one', 'fortunate', 'ones', 'picked', 'up', 'sensation', 'early', 'enough', 'saw', 'Ringu', 'long', 'remake', 'was', 'released', 'who', 'watch', 'reverse', 'order', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'disappointed', 'simply', 'lose', 'out', 'effect', 'unique', 'time', 'experience', 'held', ""'m"", 'not', 'suggesting', 'Ringu', ""n't"", 'worth', 'viewing', 'just', 'flaws', 'creators', 'remake', 'were', 'generally', 'able', 'rectify', 'having', 'knowledge', 'what', 'end', 'definitely', 'away', 'result.The', 'plot', 'videotape', 'containing', 'bizarre', 'creepy', 'imagery', 'When', 'someone', 'tape', 'immediately', 'receive', 'phone', 'call', 'countdown', 'will', 'die', 'seven', 'days', 'reasons', 'are', 'completely', 'unclear', 'majority', 'film', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'attempting', 'save', 'own', 'lives', 'watching', 'tape', 'slowly', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'discover', 'who', 'curse', 'why', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'plot', 'thought', 'was', 'stupid', 'Describing', 'friends', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'still', 'same', 'response', 'Ringu', 'convincing', 'enough', 'really', 'get', 'skin', 'tape', 'really', 'creepy', 'starters', 'far', 'shorter', 'remake', 'combination', 'grating', 'sounds', 'atmospheric', 'visuals', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'works', 'really', 'well', 'music', 'film', 'minimal', 'say', 'least', 'really', 'only', 'kicks', 'when', 'something', 'scary', 'important', 'occurs', 'certainly', 'not', 'utilized', 'shock', 'value', 'so', 'many', 'American', 'movies', 'days', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'doubt', 'shocking', 'finale', 'viewer', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'nearly', 'soiled', 'first', 'viewing', 'consider', 'be', 'fairly', 'difficult', 'person', 'scare.As', 'version', 'better', 'well', 'most', 'cases', 'find', 'remakes', 'fairly', 'pointless', 'exercises', 'nearly', 'always', 'disappointing', 'Ring', 'opinion', 'far', 'superior', 'Ringu', 'following', 'reasons', 'acting', 'much', 'better', 'story', ""n't"", 'rely', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'being', 'able', 'read', 'minds', 'unravel', 'whole', 'heap', 'new', 'background', 'information', 'characters', 'involved', 'even', 'flaws', 'still', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Ringu', 'suggest', 'fans', 'remake', 'check', 'out', 'see', 'where', 'whole', 'thing', 'started', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'either', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Japanese', 'version', 'first', 'full', 'appreciation']",N/A

I saw the American version (The Ring with Naomi Watts) first and thought it was pretty scary. In fact, I paid to see it twice in theaters and bought it as soon as it came out on DVD. When I heard that the Japanese predecessor was better, I had to watch it. I was impressed. At the time, I still didn't think highly of foreign films; I still expected the bad dubbing and horrible special effects. This movie marked the beginning of my newfound appreciation for foreign films. Even more astonishing was that this movie helped me better understand the American version that I had already watched and loved. I think what makes Ringu better is that the Japanese aren't afraid to bring elements of the paranormal into their movies. Psychics (from what I read and hear) are pretty common in Japan, and the idea of psychic abilites plays into Ringu a lot. I think if the American version had played that angle up more the movie would have been even better. Ringu's ending is more sinister than The Ring's ending; it poses some difficult questions (at least it did for me). The only downside for some people will be that there is no English soundtrack; you have to read subtitles while you watch the action.

735111,A1YP6L7ZFKE8ZK,B000088NQR,Brian Sullivan,"[14, 15]","I've long been a fan of Asian cinema, and I'd heard about RINGU for a few years but hadn't seen it until recently. In fact, I deliberately avoided the US remake until I'd seen the original. Anyway, I ordered the original trilogy (RING, RING 2 and RING 0) and watched them all over the course of a few nights.While not exactly living up to the breathless hype that I've found all over the internet, RINGU nonetheless succeeds greatly in its ability to draw you in and keep you feeling awfully uncomfortable as you wait for unpleasant things to befall the cast. The antagonist (protagonist?) Sadako is one of the most memorable and terrifying characters that I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. I've always been a fan of the ""ambiguous"" storyline, and the fact that there's a lot to RINGU that isn't easily explained was very refreshing. Too many Hollywood movies hold your hand and explain every little thing, which only insults my intelligence. I'm glad that there's a sense of mystery mixed in with the dread, which RINGU delivers in spades. Highly recommended.The first sequel, RING 2, picks up where the first one left off. We see some familiar characters, and there's an emphasis on the scientific study and explanation of Sadako's supernatural power. Not quite as creepy as the first film, but it does have its unsettling moments; one in particular that involves the appearance of Sadako's mother Shizuko. A fine continuation of the story, but not exactly essential.Which brings us to RING 0, which is actually a prequel to the first film. It has a slightly different style to it (different director) and the focus is on character development and interaction. It's more or less Sadako's story (complete with one of the most gut wrenching tragic endings I've ever seen) and it sheds light on who (and what) she was while painting her in a very sympathetic light. The actress who plays Sadako was riveting and draws you into her world from the moment you see her. It's a very emotional film, and by the time the end credits came up I felt like someone had punched me in the stomach. No overt gore, no sex, no nudity, just an attention to subtleties that works magnificently. The first time we see the Sadako that we know from the first film was one of the creepiest sequences I've ever sat through. I literally had chills. Essential viewing.Therefore, my recommendation is to watch RINGU, then RING 0, and then RING 2. At least that's how I'd have done it had I known better. In that order, the narrative is better and the viewer's relationship with the characters (especially Sadako) is much more enhanced. Unforgettable characters, highly imaginative story, expertly crafted filmmaking.

While Ring, a blockbuster success in Japan, does deliver some chills (especially to those who can get scared easily), it is ultimately disappointing.The movie starts off very well, with a girl who tells her friend about a videotape she had watched a week ago. In it were some disturbing (not gory) images then a phone call at the end of it. The phone call indicated that she was going to die at the end of the week. In the movie, this premise is an urban legend that they brush off, but as the girl goes downstairs, the TV suddenly turns on and she found dead the next morning. It is the second most chilling scene in the movie and sets the tone. The next day, a reporter, covering the case finds out about the legend and begins a search for the tape. She finds it and she is given the same call. In one week, she is going to die. Of course, she won't take it lying down, so she enlists her ex-husband and they begin researching the history of the tape.The actual investigation takes 80% of the movie and it is non too exciting to watch. We do get a sense of dread as each day is counted, and the investigation itself is interesting, in a Changeling, sort of way, but many things pop up that begin to throw water on the flame we call reality. We learn that her husband is suddenly Psychic and this psychic allows the reporter to magically appear in scenes that happened years ago, a la Mummy Returns. However, the background story in and of itself is fairly boring and there are little twists and turns. It is more interesting when they dissect the videotape for evidence and clues.The last day (the movie is broken over a period of 7 days) is the most terrifying, due to self-motivated fear. We all know what is going to happen at 7:00 p.m. and as the main characters become more frantic in their actions to find a solution, the viewer also shares in the sense of despiration. When the phenomenon finally happens, it is a scene right out of a 1980's Lamberto Bava movie, but much better done. It is scary scene that caused several people in our viewing audience (both ladies and one guy) to gasp. It is a well crafted scene. However, the ending of the movie is poorly done. How does the reporter figure out the answer? There could have been 100 different answers to why she was spared, but of course she knows the right one.Anyway, the fear that eminates from this movie is like that of the Blair Witch Project. It is self-created and those who are fearless when watching horror movies may not be too impressed. However, all my friends who watched the movie said it was scary as heck, so hence my recommendation for the casual horror movie lover....Rating: B-",3,"Man, I've seen too many horror movies",1120694400,"07 7, 2005",2005,2783,"['know', 'when', 'have', 'watched', 'too', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'when', 'friends', 'are', 'cringing', 'terror', 'can', 'do', 'yawn', 'Ring', 'blockbuster', 'success', 'Japan', 'deliver', 'chills', 'especially', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'scared', 'easily', 'ultimately', 'disappointing.The', 'movie', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'girl', 'who', 'friend', 'videotape', 'had', 'watched', 'week', 'ago', 'were', 'disturbing', 'not', 'gory', 'then', 'phone', 'call', 'end', 'phone', 'call', 'indicated', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'end', 'week', 'movie', 'premise', 'urban', 'legend', 'brush', 'off', 'girl', 'downstairs', 'TV', 'suddenly', 'found', 'dead', 'next', 'morning', 'second', 'most', 'chilling', 'scene', 'movie', 'tone', 'next', 'day', 'reporter', 'covering', 'case', 'out', 'legend', 'search', 'tape', 'given', 'same', 'call', 'one', 'week', 'going', 'die', 'course', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'lying', 'down', 'ex-husband', 'begin', 'researching', 'history', 'tape.The', 'actual', 'investigation', '80', '%', 'movie', 'non', 'too', 'exciting', 'watch', 'do', 'get', 'sense', 'dread', 'day', 'counted', 'investigation', 'interesting', 'Changeling', 'sort', 'way', 'many', 'things', 'pop', 'up', 'begin', 'throw', 'water', 'flame', 'call', 'reality', 'learn', 'husband', 'suddenly', 'Psychic', 'psychic', 'reporter', 'magically', 'appear', 'scenes', 'happened', 'years', 'ago', 'la', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'However', 'background', 'story', 'fairly', 'boring', 'are', 'little', 'twists', 'turns', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'dissect', 'videotape', 'evidence', 'clues.The', 'last', 'day', 'movie', 'broken', 'period', '7', 'days', 'most', 'terrifying', 'due', 'self-motivated', 'fear', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', '7:00', 'p.m.', 'main', 'characters', 'become', 'more', 'frantic', 'actions', 'find', 'solution', 'viewer', 'also', 'shares', 'sense', 'despiration', 'When', 'phenomenon', 'finally', 'scene', 'right', '1980', 'Lamberto', 'Bava', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'done', 'scary', 'scene', 'caused', 'several', 'people', 'viewing', 'audience', 'ladies', 'one', 'guy', 'gasp', 'well', 'crafted', 'scene', 'However', 'ending', 'movie', 'poorly', 'done', 'How', 'reporter', 'figure', 'answer', 'could', 'have', 'been', '100', 'different', 'answers', 'why', 'was', 'spared', 'course', 'right', 'one.Anyway', 'fear', 'movie', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'self-created', 'who', 'are', 'fearless', 'when', 'watching', 'horror', 'movies', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'impressed', 'However', 'friends', 'who', 'watched', 'movie', 'said', 'was', 'scary', 'heck', 'so', 'hence', 'recommendation', 'casual', 'horror', 'movie', 'lover', '.Rating', 'B-']",N/A

Ringu's ex-husband/father character has some ridiculous psychic abilities that are used to give the viewer some insight into the motivations behind the spooky little girl.  This was handled much better in the American version, where these things are found out through journalistic investigation (the heroine is a reporter, for goodness sake) and confrontation of the girls' father.

The link between these mysterious deaths appears to be a videotape that all watched together while spending the night away from home.  Is this merely an urban legend, or is there actually some substance to the claims of these young students? Reiko ventures out to where the group stayed that fateful night when they watched this purportedly cursed video tape and finds exactly what she's looking for.  A creepy, grainy videotape with bizarre images.  Shortly after viewing the tape, she receives a phone call letting her know that death awaits her in exactly a week's time.Reiko enlists the aid of her ex-husband and psychic Ryuji to help her unravel this mystery.  Together they analyze the video in hopes of discerning its maker and lifting the curse.  Their task becomes more imperative when their son, Yoichi, comes across the video and watches it himself.  Will Reiko and Ryuji be able to find a way to lift the curse in time to save themselves and their son?After having watched ""The Ring"" and been thoroughly scared by that movie, I simply had to watch the movie that ""started it all,"" so to speak (""The Ring"" and its upcoming sequel and prequel).  Several people had told me that they felt this film was scarier than its American counter-part, while others felt the opposite.  I don't exactly feel as though one is scarier than another.  Rather, they are merely different kinds of ""scary.""  This version is far subtler in its scare-tactics than is the American version.  Rather than use extreme make-up and visual effects, this version takes advantage of a creepy score, good acting, and a great plot to make its audience squirm.At first, the Americanized version of the film appears to be almost a shot-for-shot remake of this film.  However, as the movie progresses it becomes clear that there are several note-worthy differences between the two.Aside from the make-up and effects, one difference between the two was that ""Ringu"" was far less detailed than was ""The Ring.""  In ""The Ring,"" much of the plot gets spoon-fed to the viewers, while ""Ringu"" allows for one's own ""filling in of the gaps.""  Some people may appreciate this more than others.  I feel that this tactic allowed for more use of one's imagination, which can be far scarier than the alternative at times.  Part of this difference in detail involves the videotape itself.  In ""Ringu,"" the tape is much shorter and seems to give less insight to the viewer.  Both versions of the creepy video are equally unsettling, merely in different ways.  Both create an incredible sense of elusive foreboding.  Yet another difference is the role the young boy plays in both films.  In ""Ringu,"" he is merely a minor actor, while in ""The Ring"" the reporter's son plays a much more potent and crucial role.  Either way, however, this doesn't really detract from the main plot of the film.Both of these films are wonderfully scary and shockingly disturbing in their own way.  Neither version should be over-looked by any fan of the horror/thriller genre(s).  If you haven't watched either of these films yet, then I would recommend this one first, as it's subtleties might not be as easily appreciated after having been treated to the pricey, hollywood-ified effects and make-up prevalent in the American counter-part.",5,Excellent Utilization of the Minimalist Approach,1086739200,"06 9, 2004",2004,3586,"['When', 'young', 'girl', 'mysteriously', 'presumably', 'cause', 'aunt', 'reporter', 'necessary', 'investigate', 'further', 'Reiko', 'questions', 'niece', 'friends', 'only', 'find', 'student', 'who', 'attended', 'same', 'school', 'couple', 'friends', 'died', 'same', 'day', 'also', 'known', 'cause', 'link', 'mysterious', 'deaths', 'be', 'videotape', 'watched', 'together', 'spending', 'night', 'away', 'home', 'merely', 'urban', 'legend', 'actually', 'substance', 'claims', 'young', 'students', 'Reiko', 'ventures', 'out', 'where', 'group', 'stayed', 'fateful', 'night', 'when', 'watched', 'purportedly', 'cursed', 'video', 'tape', 'exactly', 'what', 'looking', 'creepy', 'grainy', 'videotape', 'bizarre', 'images', 'Shortly', 'viewing', 'tape', 'phone', 'call', 'letting', 'know', 'death', 'exactly', 'week', 'time.Reiko', 'aid', 'ex-husband', 'psychic', 'Ryuji', 'help', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'Together', 'analyze', 'video', 'hopes', 'discerning', 'maker', 'lifting', 'curse', 'task', 'more', 'imperative', 'when', 'son', 'Yoichi', 'video', 'watches', 'Will', 'Reiko', 'Ryuji', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'way', 'lift', 'curse', 'time', 'save', 'son', 'having', 'watched', 'Ring', 'been', 'thoroughly', 'scared', 'movie', 'simply', 'had', 'watch', 'movie', 'started', 'so', 'speak', 'Ring', 'upcoming', 'sequel', 'prequel', 'Several', 'people', 'had', 'told', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'scarier', 'American', 'counter-part', 'others', 'felt', 'opposite', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'feel', 'one', 'scarier', 'are', 'merely', 'different', 'kinds', 'scary', 'version', 'far', 'subtler', 'scare-tactics', 'American', 'version', 'Rather', 'use', 'extreme', 'make-up', 'visual', 'effects', 'version', 'advantage', 'creepy', 'score', 'good', 'acting', 'great', 'plot', 'make', 'audience', 'squirm.At', 'first', 'Americanized', 'version', 'film', 'be', 'almost', 'shot-for-shot', 'remake', 'film', 'However', 'movie', 'clear', 'are', 'several', 'note-worthy', 'differences', 'two.Aside', 'make-up', 'effects', 'one', 'difference', 'two', 'was', 'Ringu', 'was', 'far', 'less', 'detailed', 'was', 'Ring', 'Ring', 'much', 'plot', 'spoon-fed', 'viewers', 'Ringu', 'one', 'own', 'filling', 'gaps', 'people', 'may', 'appreciate', 'more', 'others', 'feel', 'tactic', 'allowed', 'more', 'use', 'one', 'imagination', 'can', 'be', 'far', 'scarier', 'alternative', 'times', 'Part', 'difference', 'detail', 'videotape', 'Ringu', 'tape', 'much', 'shorter', 'give', 'less', 'insight', 'viewer', 'versions', 'creepy', 'video', 'are', 'equally', 'unsettling', 'merely', 'different', 'ways', 'create', 'incredible', 'sense', 'elusive', 'foreboding', 'difference', 'role', 'young', 'boy', 'plays', 'films', 'Ringu', 'merely', 'minor', 'actor', 'Ring', 'reporter', 'son', 'much', 'more', 'potent', 'crucial', 'role', 'way', 'however', ""n't"", 'really', 'detract', 'main', 'plot', 'film.Both', 'films', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'scary', 'shockingly', 'disturbing', 'own', 'way', 'version', 'should', 'be', 'over-looked', 'fan', 'horror/thriller', 'genre', 's', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'either', 'films', 'yet', 'then', 'would', 'recommend', 'one', 'first', 'subtleties', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'easily', 'appreciated', 'having', 'been', 'treated', 'pricey', 'hollywood-ified', 'effects', 'make-up', 'prevalent', 'American', 'counter-part']",N/A
735119,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B000088NQR,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[7, 11]","The first theatrical version of Koji Suzuki's novel, as there was Ringu Kanzenban, a 1995 TV movie, is the one that inspired two Japanese sequels, a prequel, the South Korean version, Ring Virus, and oh yes, the pitiful American version with Naomi Watts.  Needless to say, Ringu stands head above them.The story's well-told by now, but let me relate it one more time.  Following the death of her niece, high school student Tomoko, Reiko Asakawa, a journalist, investigates the cause.  Seems like there's a cursed video that'll kill someone within a week of that person watching it.  As a cute high school student tells her in a videocamera interview, ""I heard that suddenly, there's this scary woman who says, `you'll die in one week.""  Well, in the opening moments of the movie, Tomoko tells her friend Masami that she and her friends saw a weird video while vacationing at Izu Pacific Island.  It turns out that Tomoko's vacationing friends also died on the exact same day and time as her, and that one of the girls died with the same look of sheer shock that Tomoko did.Reiko goes to the same resort, discovers a video in a nondescript blank case, watches it, and, well, gets the curse.  The imagery of the video has a surreal yet eerie look, the woman combing her hair, the man with white cloth on his head pointing, the dancing Chinese characters, and that eerie scraping metal sound.  To that end, she enlists the aid of Ryuji Takayama, her ex-husband who teaches either math or physics at a university.  It's his analytical and logical mind that she feels can help her in this dilemma.Ryuji watches the video and after getting Reiko to copy the video, analyzes weird sounds, images of an erupting volcano, and the character ""Sada"" seen in someone's eye.  Their investigation leads to Mount Miharajima on Izu Oshima, which is an island inbetween the two peninsulas which encircle Tokyo Bay, Izu Hanto and Boso Hanto.I'd call this more a suspense thriller with supernatural overtones rather than an outright horror flick.  And it's a balance of appealing characters, an interesting and unique story, and low-key rather than Hollywood-style overblown style that place this over The Ring.  Other than the images of the video, flashback techniques in B&W; help advance the story.  So does the technique used in Tomoko's death, a close-up of her fear-stricken face, a sudden reverse image, then nothing.The tension keeps building as the date is presented onscreen, followed by a low and eerie sound, counting down the days Reiko has to live.  There is hardly any incidental music to speak of, as much of the sounds are of the same low and haunting sounds.  However, the thing that'll guarantee Ringu its immortality is the sight of Sadako, long black hair covering her face, dressed in a white robe, creeping out of the TV, hands with fingernails torn out, stalking her prey.  This spectre has been copied or revised in Japanese films like The Hypnotist, Ju-On, its American remake The Grudge, and the Scary Movie 3 parody.Another thing to note is the change of Asakawa to a female character, as opposed to the male Kazuyuki Asakawa in the original novel.  And the distorted photographs and marks on arms is something in both the manga and here.As Reiko Asakawa, Nanako Matsushima balances an amiable, hard-working employee and loving single mother who wants to spend more time with her son.  She's definitely warmer than the Korean version's Eun Kyung Shin, who played Hong Sun-Ju as somewhat of a cold fish.  Hiroyuki Sanada plays Ryuji with a stolid, curt, rational man who's intelligent enough to suss out the clues from the video.  And Rikiya Otaka also does well as Yoichi, who's cute and likeable rather than creepy.Hopefully, the original movie Ringu 2 and the original sequel, Rasen (Spiral) will come out soon on DVD to see how the Ring story continues movie-wise.",5,The original movie stands heads above its successors,1107648000,"02 6, 2005",2005,3875,"['first', 'theatrical', 'version', 'Koji', 'Suzuki', 'novel', 'was', 'Ringu', 'Kanzenban', '1995', 'TV', 'movie', 'one', 'inspired', 'two', 'Japanese', 'sequels', 'prequel', 'South', 'Korean', 'version', 'Ring', 'Virus', 'oh', 'yes', 'pitiful', 'American', 'version', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Needless', 'say', 'Ringu', 'head', 'them.The', 'story', 'well-told', 'now', 'let', 'relate', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'Following', 'death', 'niece', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Tomoko', 'Reiko', 'Asakawa', 'journalist', 'cause', 'cursed', 'video', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'someone', 'week', 'person', 'watching', 'cute', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'videocamera', 'interview', 'heard', 'suddenly', 'scary', 'woman', 'who', ""'ll"", 'die', 'one', 'week', 'Well', 'opening', 'moments', 'movie', 'Tomoko', 'friend', 'Masami', 'friends', 'saw', 'weird', 'video', 'vacationing', 'Izu', 'Pacific', 'Island', 'out', 'Tomoko', 'vacationing', 'friends', 'also', 'died', 'exact', 'same', 'day', 'time', 'one', 'girls', 'died', 'same', 'look', 'sheer', 'shock', 'Tomoko', 'did.Reiko', 'same', 'resort', 'video', 'nondescript', 'blank', 'case', 'watches', 'well', 'curse', 'imagery', 'video', 'surreal', 'yet', 'eerie', 'look', 'woman', 'combing', 'hair', 'man', 'white', 'cloth', 'head', 'pointing', 'dancing', 'Chinese', 'characters', 'eerie', 'scraping', 'metal', 'sound', 'end', 'aid', 'Ryuji', 'Takayama', 'ex-husband', 'who', 'math', 'physics', 'university', 'analytical', 'logical', 'mind', 'can', 'help', 'dilemma.Ryuji', 'video', 'getting', 'Reiko', 'copy', 'video', 'weird', 'sounds', 'images', 'erupting', 'volcano', 'character', 'Sada', 'seen', 'someone', 'eye', 'investigation', 'Mount', 'Miharajima', 'Izu', 'Oshima', 'island', 'two', 'peninsulas', 'encircle', 'Tokyo', 'Bay', 'Izu', 'Hanto', 'Boso', 'Hanto.I', ""'d"", 'call', 'more', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'supernatural', 'overtones', 'rather', 'outright', 'horror', 'flick', 'balance', 'appealing', 'characters', 'interesting', 'unique', 'story', 'low-key', 'rather', 'Hollywood-style', 'overblown', 'style', 'place', 'Ring', 'Other', 'images', 'video', 'flashback', 'techniques', 'B', 'W', 'help', 'advance', 'story', 'So', 'technique', 'used', 'Tomoko', 'death', 'close-up', 'fear-stricken', 'face', 'sudden', 'reverse', 'image', 'then', 'nothing.The', 'tension', 'keeps', 'building', 'date', 'presented', 'onscreen', 'followed', 'low', 'eerie', 'sound', 'counting', 'down', 'days', 'Reiko', 'live', 'hardly', 'incidental', 'music', 'speak', 'much', 'sounds', 'are', 'same', 'low', 'haunting', 'sounds', 'However', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'guarantee', 'Ringu', 'immortality', 'sight', 'Sadako', 'long', 'black', 'hair', 'covering', 'face', 'dressed', 'white', 'robe', 'creeping', 'TV', 'fingernails', 'torn', 'out', 'stalking', 'prey', 'spectre', 'been', 'copied', 'revised', 'Japanese', 'films', 'Hypnotist', 'Ju-On', 'American', 'remake', 'Grudge', 'Scary', 'Movie', '3', 'parody.Another', 'thing', 'note', 'change', 'Asakawa', 'female', 'character', 'opposed', 'male', 'Kazuyuki', 'Asakawa', 'original', 'novel', 'distorted', 'photographs', 'marks', 'arms', 'something', 'manga', 'here.As', 'Reiko', 'Asakawa', 'Nanako', 'Matsushima', 'amiable', 'hard-working', 'employee', 'loving', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'son', 'definitely', 'warmer', 'Korean', 'version', 'Eun', 'Kyung', 'Shin', 'who', 'played', 'Hong', 'Sun-Ju', 'somewhat', 'cold', 'fish', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', 'Ryuji', 'stolid', 'curt', 'rational', 'man', 'who', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'suss', 'out', 'clues', 'video', 'Rikiya', 'Otaka', 'also', 'well', 'Yoichi', 'who', 'cute', 'likeable', 'rather', 'creepy.Hopefully', 'original', 'movie', 'Ringu', '2', 'original', 'sequel', 'Rasen', 'Spiral', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'soon', 'DVD', 'see', 'how', 'Ring', 'story', 'movie-wise']",N/A
735120,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000088NQR,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[111, 116]","I loved The Ring, and I had been looking forward to seeing the original Japanese adaptation of the film, based on the novel by Koji Suzuki, for some time.  I was especially pleased to see the Japanese film released with English subtitles rather than voice dubbing, since this helps preserve the original atmosphere of the film.  Both Ringu and The Ring are superb, dark, creepy films, very similar yet very different from one another.  Inevitably, whichever film you watch first will probably be your favorite of the two.  Ringu starts out very much like its American counterpart, with two young girls alone in a house discussing the rumors going around about a video that somehow kills you seven days after you watch it.  The aunt of the first victim is a reporter who begins to investigate the story of the tape, soliciting the help of her somewhat inscrutable ex-husband, and soon finding herself in an incredible fight to save the lives of herself, her ex, and her creepy little boy.  At this point, Ringu begins to distinguish itself from The Ring, although both follow the same general plot through to the end.Perhaps the biggest difference between Ringu and The Ring is the contents of the mysterious videotape.  In Ringu, the cursed tape is much shorter and far less symbolic, although its grainy appearance and comparative simplicity add a greater dash of realism to it.  The tape presented in The Ring is much more frightening and visceral; subtlety rules the day in the Japanese film.  Another significant difference concerns the character of the reporter's ex-husband; in Ringu, he (as well as his son, to some degree) possesses a gift that distinguishes him from his American counterpart.  This aids the plot along, but it deprives the viewer of some of the mystery and insight gained from watching the mystery unfold in The Ring.  Ringu's storyline is much more compact and straightforward, providing us with much less insight into the forces at play in explaining the existence of the cursed video.  There is one jolting plot twist in the later stages of The Ring that is not found in Ringu, and I think this takes a little something away from the concluding drama, but Ringu definitely delivers a much more frightening, completely unforgettable climax.  The big scene with the little girl climbing out of the well is pretty darned creepy in The Ring, but Ringu's presentation of this seminal event is many times more impressive and frightening; I only wish I could have seen the scene from Ringu before I saw The Ring.  It is spooky enough as it is, but I can only dream about the impact the scene might have on those with no previous knowledge of what is about to happen.  What The Ring accomplishes pretty impressively with a type of trick photography is expressed naturally in Ringu, making it much more eerie and unsettling.If you did see and enjoy The Ring, I would definitely recommend getting a copy of Ringu.  The knowledge you already have will diminish the impact Ringu has on you, but there are enough differences between the two films to guarantee you a thoroughly enjoyable return trip into this most special world of fear.  If you are debating which version to see first, I would recommend starting out with Ringu, if for no other reason than for the power of the much creepier ending.  I prefer The Ring's more elaborate and symbolic presentation, more in-depth background into the story of the tape, and added plot twists to the less elaborate presentation of Ringu, but the fact that the American film adds new elements to the plot makes The Ring more engaging for those having already seen Ringu than Ringu is for those having already seen The Ring.",5,The surprisingly unique Japanese film that inspired The Ring,1059782400,"08 2, 2003",2003,3683,"['loved', 'Ring', 'had', 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'original', 'Japanese', 'adaptation', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Koji', 'Suzuki', 'time', 'was', 'especially', 'pleased', 'see', 'Japanese', 'film', 'released', 'English', 'subtitles', 'rather', 'voice', 'dubbing', 'preserve', 'original', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'Ringu', 'Ring', 'are', 'superb', 'dark', 'creepy', 'films', 'very', 'similar', 'yet', 'very', 'different', 'one', 'Inevitably', 'whichever', 'film', 'watch', 'first', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'favorite', 'two', 'Ringu', 'out', 'very', 'much', 'American', 'counterpart', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'alone', 'house', 'discussing', 'rumors', 'going', 'video', 'somehow', 'seven', 'days', 'watch', 'aunt', 'first', 'victim', 'reporter', 'who', 'investigate', 'story', 'tape', 'soliciting', 'help', 'somewhat', 'inscrutable', 'ex-husband', 'soon', 'finding', 'incredible', 'fight', 'save', 'lives', 'herself', 'ex', 'creepy', 'little', 'boy', 'point', 'Ringu', 'distinguish', 'Ring', 'follow', 'same', 'general', 'plot', 'end.Perhaps', 'biggest', 'difference', 'Ringu', 'Ring', 'contents', 'mysterious', 'videotape', 'Ringu', 'cursed', 'tape', 'much', 'shorter', 'far', 'less', 'symbolic', 'grainy', 'appearance', 'comparative', 'simplicity', 'add', 'greater', 'dash', 'realism', 'tape', 'presented', 'Ring', 'much', 'more', 'frightening', 'visceral', 'subtlety', 'rules', 'day', 'Japanese', 'film', 'significant', 'difference', 'concerns', 'character', 'reporter', 'ex-husband', 'Ringu', 'as', 'well', 'son', 'degree', 'gift', 'American', 'counterpart', 'plot', 'viewer', 'mystery', 'insight', 'gained', 'watching', 'mystery', 'unfold', 'Ring', 'Ringu', 'storyline', 'much', 'more', 'compact', 'straightforward', 'providing', 'much', 'less', 'insight', 'forces', 'play', 'explaining', 'existence', 'cursed', 'video', 'one', 'jolting', 'plot', 'twist', 'later', 'stages', 'Ring', 'not', 'found', 'Ringu', 'think', 'little', 'something', 'away', 'concluding', 'drama', 'Ringu', 'definitely', 'much', 'more', 'frightening', 'completely', 'unforgettable', 'climax', 'big', 'scene', 'little', 'girl', 'climbing', 'well', 'pretty', 'darned', 'creepy', 'Ring', 'Ringu', 'presentation', 'seminal', 'event', 'many', 'times', 'more', 'impressive', 'frightening', 'only', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'scene', 'Ringu', 'saw', 'Ring', 'spooky', 'enough', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'impact', 'scene', 'might', 'have', 'previous', 'knowledge', 'what', 'about', 'happen', 'What', 'Ring', 'accomplishes', 'pretty', 'impressively', 'type', 'trick', 'photography', 'expressed', 'naturally', 'Ringu', 'making', 'much', 'more', 'eerie', 'unsettling.If', 'did', 'see', 'enjoy', 'Ring', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'getting', 'copy', 'Ringu', 'knowledge', 'already', 'have', 'will', 'diminish', 'impact', 'Ringu', 'are', 'enough', 'differences', 'two', 'films', 'guarantee', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'return', 'trip', 'most', 'special', 'world', 'fear', 'are', 'debating', 'version', 'see', 'first', 'would', 'recommend', 'starting', 'out', 'Ringu', 'other', 'reason', 'power', 'much', 'creepier', 'ending', 'prefer', 'Ring', 'more', 'elaborate', 'symbolic', 'presentation', 'more', 'in-depth', 'background', 'story', 'tape', 'added', 'plot', 'twists', 'less', 'elaborate', 'presentation', 'Ringu', 'fact', 'American', 'film', 'new', 'elements', 'plot', 'Ring', 'more', 'engaging', 'having', 'already', 'seen', 'Ringu', 'Ringu', 'having', 'already', 'seen', 'Ring']",N/A

But before there was that film, there was ""Ringu,"" a hair-raising ghost story where something as insignificant as a videotape can kill.Four teenagers have died mysteriously, and another has gone mad. After finding that her niece was literally scared to death, Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima) begins investigating the cabin where the four kids stayed. There she finds a strange videotape full of bizarre images. Then the phone rings. It fits the profile of the ""cursed video"" that has been circulating, which will kill the watcher after seven days.Reiko is understandably terrified -- especially when her young son also watches it. She calls in her ex-husband Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada), who initially discounts her fears. But soon he begins to believe as well, and assists Reiko in investigating the origins of the tape, and the strange images on it. They find that the source of it is a young girl with monstrous psychic powers, who was murdered thirty years ago...""Ringu"" has become one of those rare films that are frequently ripped off (especially in Asian cinema), referenced, and remade (especially in Hollywood). Crawling ghosts with long drippy hair, slow-acting curses and all that.But as we all know, the first is usually the best. There aren't any masked slashers or bloody bodies in this. Instead, there is an everyday item that happens to be cursed, and a jerky-limbed girl who can kill with a thought -- and even death can't stop her. (Interestingly, Sadako and her mother were based on real people)Hideo Nakata did a magnificent job with a film that could have been incredibly tedious; much of ""Ringu"" is detective work, with the ghoulish Sadako only entering the picture at the end. Instead, it has suspense. Colours are muted, and the plot grows more taut and claustrophobic as the characters try to beat the clock. And the end is a terrifying twist that can't be seen in advance -- but which leaves us wondering what we would do in that situation.Matsushima and Sanada are excellent leads for this movie; not only do they have excellent chemistry, but they seem like a plausible pair of exes. Reiko is played as a strong, smart woman who desperately wants to save her son, while Ryuji is insensitive and rather brusque, but cares as much for Reiko as he seems capable of.With a quietly taut storyline and a terrifying demon-spawn villain, ""Ringu"" strips horror down to its bare bones, and lets the ordinary scare us silly.

The Ring overpowers you with special effects, especially in the scenes where, uh, bad things start happening.  The effects are so jarring they tend to throw you out of the movie.  Also, there is far more backstory in The Ring, and I think some of this is a bit overpowering also.  It gets in the way of the plot.  Ringu is more subtle, it relies more on the viewer's imagination.  There is at least one plot element that makes more sense in Ringu than the Ring, but I can't tell you what it is without giving away the plot.  Well, it has something to do with location.  Well, that's about all I can say about that.  If you like horror movies, then see Ringu before seeing The Ring.  There are no extras on the DVD of Ringu.  However, I think the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack on Ringu is extremely well done.  It is restrained--the back channels are not used that much, but when they are used they are used extremely effectively.  I found the effect almost dizzying in one scene. The video transfer looks very good.  One final note--there are scenes in The Ring that involve horses, and bad things happen to them.  If you dislike animal violence you will definitely like Ringu better than The Ring as these scenes do not exist in Ringu.

735135,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B000088NQR,Ernest Jagger,"[3, 3]","There are many varied opinions between the two Ring films. ""Ringu"" released in 1998, and its American counterpart ""The Ring,"" starring Naomi Watts have their favorites, depending on whether or not one viewed the first one from Japan first, or viewed the American version first. For most Americans it was the latter. However, I liked them both. And yet, I can understand why many in the USA would prefer the American version over the Japanese film. Since I liked them both, it is difficult for me to prefer one over the other.Moreover, they both have their own distinctive styles when it comes to the nuances of horror. I have always felt that the Japanese were superior to this than American film-makers were; as the gore and violence are part and parcel of American horror films. On the other hand, having seen my fair share of Japanese horror films over the past 40 odd years, I would have to say that Japanese film-makers can put just as much gore into a film as American film-makers. The film ""Ringu"" was directed by Hideo Nakata, and I believe he did an excellent job with this particular film.I have never read the book the film is based on, therefore, unlike some of the other reviewers I cannont comment on how the film and book correspond. However, for those who have not seen the film ""Ringu,"" give it a chance. You might find that you like it. Moreover, this would give you a good chance to compare the two films, and see firsthand how the Japanese and American directors and screen writers differ on what they feel are shocking to their audiences. Plus, you get to compare the cinematography of the two films. What is similar? What differs?One of the great things I like about Japanese horror films today is that they are different, some good, some not, but they are definitely different in style than their American counterparts. Also, it is important that films be viewed in their own languange with subtitles. You REALLY get more out of the inflections of the characters than if they were speaking in English. There was a time when I was younger that if you watched a Japanese film on television, odds were that it was not subtitled or in Japanese. And the English translations were horrid. Having seen great Japanese films at the theatres, and then the occassional viewing on TV, this made for one terrible viewing. Anyway, enjoy the film it is worth your watch. And if you happen to like the US version better, that's ok, because it's a good film too!

735137,AGKOHQI1OP8V3,B000088NQR,"evergreen ""Jerome G.V.""","[48, 51]","'Ringu' tells the tale of a video tape that, for reasons unknown, that kills you seven days after you watch it.Reiko, a journalist, is greeted by a death in the family one day. Her teenage niece died mysteriously one day, leaving no trace as to why. She soon discovers that three other of her niece's close friends died on the same day as her. Upon further investigation, she finds that the four teenagers had something in common: they had all seen a cryptic video tape. The trail leads her to the tape itself and, out of curiosity, watches it. The urban legend is proven to be a lot more real than she ever expected and soon, Reiko is on a race against time to decipher the mysteries of the tape.'Ringu' (viewed at home) achieves a sense of fear throughout the movie in the way it 'connects' with the viewer. How obvious can it get? Though not a tape, you're watching the DVD on a TV. This paranoia adds to the scares constantly.With sparse use of any real 'special effects,' the film is able to ground its otherworldly story to reality, something few modern horror films are able to do.The acting is great and the dialogue, or at least the translated script for the subtitles, never got repetitive. The actress for Reiko does a good job as the tense heroine, while the male lead actor (sorry, his name escapes me) contrasts very well with her as her often cool and relaxed ex-husband.The music chills to the bone, particularly the main theme (plays on the DVD main menu), which is just a creepy concoction of strummed guitar strings. I sat there, letting the whole menu run its course as the ambience it gave off made my blood run ice cold. 'Ringu's great utilization of sound astounded me as well, using bursts of utter cacophony to add new layers of fright to already surprsingly horrifying scenes.Quite simply, this movie impressed me in every way possible.Now, on to 'Ringu'/'The Ring' comparisons...'Ringu' operates on a single word: subtlety.It delivers the scares without convoluting the process. Fear without frills, as I say. They scare you moreso on a mental level, forever burning in (some cases only) a dread of TV's.Take, for example, the tape itself. In 'Ringu,' it really is just a bunch of forboding images, adding only clues to plot. Short and sweet.In comparison, 'The Ring' goes for the throat. It does try to scare you at a mental level as well, but it is somewhat bogged down by its own attempt of quick shocks.The tape, in this version, is much longer and thought it is adapted for plot purposes, certain parts were unnecessary and served only to provide more reasons fo disturbing imagery later on.Most importantly, one character in particular was altered in a way I didn't like, but which take is better really just depends on personal taste.That would be the journalist's son. In 'Ringu,' he had this creepy robotic feel, speaking only when needed and showing a frightening air of maturity.However, in 'The Ring,' though well-acted, he is portrayed as the 'cliche' horror film child. He spouts out insightful but scary things that he should know nothing about at his age (ie the little boy in 'Signs'). This take removes the vulnerablity his counterpart had in 'Ringu,' causing you to care less whether or not he dies.Ending my comparison, I believe 'Ringu' is the superior film, though both in and of themselves are great.Now to end with the DVD package:The main menu keeps in line with the film's simple way of fright, using the main theme as its backgroud music. The scene division is well-done. The 5.1 remaster of the film looks great as well. My only complaint is the disappointing lack of the 'Ringu' trailers.I say 'Ringu' is a sure buy and I guarantee (to most people) that you will not be disappointed.

735141,A3TVS7UW8A2NXV,B000088NQR,Garry Messick,"[9, 11]","Ringu is basically deserving of its reputation as a near-masterpiece of quiet, subtle horror.  If you like unconventional, ambiguous creep-outs like Picnic at Hanging Rock or the first half of Lost Highway (which, come to think of it, also involves some very unsettling videotapes) you'll probably appreciate this film.  I'd recommend this over the American remake, although I don't agree with those that find Gore Verbinski's version vastly inferior.  In fact, it's surprisingly well done, my only real complaint being the predictable tendency to tone down the ambiguity.  For instance, the death-dealing video in the Japanese version consists of a series of bizarre images that are never explained.  In the American version (The Ring), the images, although just as bizarre, are all eventually neatly tied up with the narrative, each one being assigned an explicit meaning.  It was a bad move that aptly illustrates the general lack of faith that Hollywood has in the intelligence/imagination of American moviegoers.  Also, although fairly well done in The Ring, the climactic scare scene just isn't as hair-raising as it is in Ringu.

735142,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000088NQR,General Zombie,"[2, 2]","Like probably most of the people out there who've seen this film, I actually saw the American remake first.  Personally, I prefer the American version, but the pairing of the two shows why remaking films can sometimes work out-- The existence of one film doesn't make the other one obsolete.  They both work in their own way.  Both are atmospheric horror films, but the remake is flashy and gaudy, whereas the original is far more sedate and generally lacked the motifs that defined the style of the remake. (i.e. water, horses, circles, the tree and a general emphasis on multiple meanings)  Again, I think the former approach is more effective, overall, but both are definitely valid.  I like the stylishness of the remake, but 'Ringu' proves that the core story and concepts are plenty powerful on their own.This film was really made on the cheap, only a little over a million bucks, I hear.  This makes it have a bleak, stark quality to it as it has little flash and the scenes are often poorly lit.  Still, despite the low budget the seams never quite tear apart, as they so often do in low-budget stuff. (See the climax of Nakata's later 'Dark Water'.)  The tape itself is fairly haunting, and the climax is exceedingly well done.  The low budget is perhaps an asset there, as it forces ingenuity and keeps you from getting to fancy or elaborate.  That, and the prominent imagery of that climactic scene is quite unforgettable, and it's easy to see why it caused such wide spread impact in Asian horror films over the next couple years.  In the end, the impact of the film comes down to some intangible things. It just has such an oppressive, bleak mood to it, though it's tough to say specifically where it comes from.  The film doesn't have very many out and out scare scenes, but it maintains an intensity thru out it all.  This music is quite effective, largely just a lot of atonal rumbling.  Nakata probably tries a little too hard with the sound at a few points, but it's definitely effective overall.The film does have a few concerns.  The two protagonists, Asakawa and Ryuji are fairly faceless and uninteresting.  (This is an aspect where the remake improves on the original, as Noah is quite likable which helps in general, and particularly adds impact to the final scenes.)  Now, having likable characters is not usually a huge concern in horror films, but here we actually follow to particular figures a lot more closely than we usually would, but we don't really find out all that much about them.  Also, I think the film perhaps tips its hand a little too early and some of the explainations are a bit too mundane.  Finally, there is a prominent flashback scene that occurs about an hour into the film which just doesn't quite work.  I think it's a bit silly. (I know I'm being vague, but I don't wanna spoil anything for those who haven't seen it.)Anyway, this is a fairly haunting film.  Not terrifying, but unsettling.  If you haven't seen any of the major Asian horror films of recent years, this is as good a place to start as any.Grade: B+",4,Better than I remembered,1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,3066,"['probably', 'most', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'actually', 'saw', 'American', 'remake', 'first', 'Personally', 'prefer', 'American', 'version', 'pairing', 'two', 'shows', 'why', 'remaking', 'films', 'can', 'sometimes', 'work', 'out', 'existence', 'one', 'film', ""n't"", 'make', 'other', 'one', 'obsolete', 'work', 'own', 'way', 'are', 'atmospheric', 'horror', 'films', 'remake', 'flashy', 'gaudy', 'original', 'far', 'more', 'sedate', 'generally', 'lacked', 'motifs', 'defined', 'style', 'remake', 'i.e', 'water', 'horses', 'circles', 'tree', 'general', 'emphasis', 'multiple', 'meanings', 'Again', 'think', 'former', 'approach', 'more', 'effective', 'overall', 'are', 'definitely', 'valid', 'stylishness', 'remake', ""'Ringu"", 'proves', 'core', 'story', 'concepts', 'are', 'plenty', 'powerful', 'own.This', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'made', 'cheap', 'only', 'little', 'million', 'bucks', 'hear', 'have', 'bleak', 'stark', 'quality', 'little', 'flash', 'scenes', 'are', 'often', 'poorly', 'lit', 'Still', 'low', 'budget', 'seams', 'never', 'quite', 'tear', 'apart', 'so', 'often', 'do', 'low-budget', 'stuff', 'See', 'climax', 'Nakata', 'later', ""'Dark"", 'Water', 'tape', 'fairly', 'haunting', 'climax', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'done', 'low', 'budget', 'perhaps', 'asset', 'there', 'ingenuity', 'keeps', 'getting', 'fancy', 'elaborate', 'prominent', 'imagery', 'climactic', 'scene', 'quite', 'unforgettable', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'caused', 'such', 'wide', 'spread', 'impact', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', 'next', 'couple', 'years', 'end', 'impact', 'film', 'down', 'intangible', 'things', 'just', 'such', 'oppressive', 'bleak', 'mood', 'tough', 'say', 'specifically', 'where', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'many', 'out', 'scare', 'scenes', 'intensity', 'thru', 'music', 'quite', 'effective', 'largely', 'just', 'lot', 'atonal', 'rumbling', 'Nakata', 'probably', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'sound', 'few', 'points', 'definitely', 'effective', 'overall.The', 'film', 'have', 'few', 'concerns', 'two', 'protagonists', 'Asakawa', 'Ryuji', 'are', 'fairly', 'faceless', 'uninteresting', 'aspect', 'where', 'remake', 'original', 'Noah', 'quite', 'likable', 'general', 'particularly', 'impact', 'final', 'scenes', 'Now', 'having', 'likable', 'characters', 'not', 'usually', 'huge', 'concern', 'horror', 'films', 'here', 'actually', 'follow', 'particular', 'figures', 'lot', 'more', 'closely', 'usually', 'would', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'out', 'that', 'much', 'Also', 'think', 'film', 'perhaps', 'hand', 'little', 'too', 'early', 'explainations', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'mundane', 'Finally', 'prominent', 'flashback', 'scene', 'hour', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'think', 'bit', 'silly', 'know', ""'m"", 'being', 'vague', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'spoil', 'anything', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Anyway', 'fairly', 'haunting', 'film', 'Not', 'terrifying', 'unsettling', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'major', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'as', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'any.Grade', 'B+']",N/A

However, the Japanese movie explained things better.To get the full story I recommend the comic book, Ringu, then The Ring.  This story, like Final Fantasy VII, leaves a lot open to discusion.  Points like what Samara was, how her parents arranged her birth, how her curse worked, and other questions are pretty much left open to let the viewers decide for themselves.The Japanese version plays up the psychic power aspect more then the American version, to the point of using it only as a way to move the plot.

Her curse reaches out through a video tape that causes those who watch it to die exactly 7 days to the very second after having viewed it.  This movie tells of Reiko, a journalist who's niece has just died a terrifying death, she begins to investigate the giurl;s death and stumbles onto a oath that could end her life throug hactions of her own.  She watches the video tape that killed her niece and gets a strange call, she has 7 days to live.The movie is told more through character development, drama and suspence, I found it more believable than the remake (The Ring), those that do not link with this version so well need t odo a little research on Japanese mythology and their traditional forms of monsters and how they were said to co-exist with humans.With the other 2 movies, it becomes more apparent that Sadako is a tragic figure rather a ruthless one as Samara is in The Ring.Truly the best horror ever, sadly ruined by the remake (the the latter is als ogood, it pales next to this).

735147,A16KRCLLTHSB5F,B000088NQR,Henry Platte,"[0, 5]","This review is spoiler-ish, and intended for people who've seen The Ring and were curious about this movie.First of all, the two films are very similiar - at the beginning, they even share most of the same shots, like the father and son confronting each other in the rain - but I think that The Ring was an improvement mainly for these reasons:1) The Ring is scarier. Some people say it's just unsubtle, but the subject at hand is a horror movie, not an existential treatise, even if the story is brainier than most. It's true that The Ring, as another review very aptly put it, 'goes for the throat,' but it does so very well, while Ringu has only a few moments of real terror. There's nothing here to match the equine imagery, or the 'drowned' faces.2) The score is very creaking and unsubtle. Obviously in a horror movie, the score kicks up whenever something scary is about to happen, but I noticed it a lot more - it seemed a lot more contrived - in this movie, as opposed to The Ring. You hear the violins start screeching and you just roll your eyes.3) Both versions skimp on the backstory, but Ringu does much more so than The Ring. In The Ring, you get to see the living Samara speak, at least, which I think is important in establishing her as a character, and the story surrounding the girl's family seems at once more ominous and more believable in The Ring. Part of what made The Ring so effective was the horror in the backstory, and it's much less developed in Ringu, even if Sadako's origin is better explained.4) The treatment of the ex-husband character (whose equivalent in the book was the main thing which made the book so great) is dissapointing in both films, but in this one, not to spoil anything, there's a random twist to his character which made no sense to me, and which was sensibly dropped in The Ring.5) The Ring actually makes it clear what the ring _is_, and what Samara's curse, symbolically, is (a disease, something that was played up a lot in the book).6) Ultimately, I think that the motivation at the heart of The Ring is revenge, even though it's suggested that Samara/Sadako is evil by nature, and in relation to #3, I don't think it's really made clear to what extent she suffered. When the ex-husband character descends into the well, he remarks in passing that she was still alive, a fact which was played up more (and to good effect) in The Ring. Ringu makes it seem sort of like Sadako created the tape just for the heck of it. The desperation and malice in her character comes across much better in The Ring. She doesn't have a character, you could say, but good monsters do, and she did in The Ring.On the other side, the acting in Ringu is just a touch better than in The Ring - the main character's face communicates fear so well, it's almost scarier than the faces of the corpses - and it avoids a couple of the eye-rolling contrivances like the sliding television which weakened The Ring with its subtler atmosphere, but ultimatley, I think a story as scary is this one deserved the extremely scary treatment given to it by The Ring.

Although the American version is more visually detailed, the faces of the victims resembling drowned victims is much more clever than the scared to death faces of Ringu since the girl did drown to death, also the video tape in the American version was more disturbing, however the American version left more holes in the actual story that Ringu cleared up for me.

Ringu is a little more scientific, explaining the girl to be protective of her Mother where in The Ring  the girl seemed to be simply pure evil.

The last time that happened was when I saw the Blob at five years old. This movie is just plain creepy and the suspense is almost too much to bear towards the end of the movie. The atmosphere of the landscapes in every scene in the movie has an eerie feel about. For instance when the main character drops off her son at his grandfathers house, you may think that this is a happy and safe place, but I just had that feeling that something scary was going to jump out from around the corner at any moment. I felt uneasy with every beautiful backdrop. I am not here to bicker about whether or not this version is better than the American remake because I think that the each hold an interesting perspective and are pretty effective at scaring the audience.

735153,ATKYFGTF6BLOL,B000088NQR,John A. Rice,"[37, 47]","Before I begin, I just want to say, I have also reviewed the American remake  and also rated it 5 stars.  I feel that I can do this simply because, after I had watched it and its predecessor, I felt like I had watched two films with only their most basic premise in common; therefore, comparing the two, I feel, is completely unfair.  Both movies were fabulous in their own respects.In The Ring, I thought that the minute-and-a-half embellishment of the first scene was a great touch (with the water pooling under the door, etc.) and I also enjoyed the almost-purposefully campy acting of the two actresses involved as it seemed, to me, to make fun of other American teen horror flicks.  As for the rest of the movie, poorly scripted dialogue and mediocre acting was the major downfall (how this could happen when Ringu's dialogue was so excellent I will never understand) - In Ringu, however, the acting seemed much more realistic, even in the first scene, and the resultant setup was also very effective.Second, the video in the remake is almost TEN TIMES more unsettling to watch than the one in Ringu- it reminded me of a demented student art film... the video in Ringu is about a fourth as long and, while its mere ambiguity is creepy, I was rather unimpressed with it.Third- the subsequent storylines are wildly different except for their culminations and each is likeable in its own respects- I like Ringu's storyline, once again, for its creepy ambiguity, but I think that The Ring gains a point here plotwise because I LOVED the idea that the main characters would seek the origin of the tape and find out more about Samara's (Sadako's) life.  It was fascinating and SUPERBLY creepy, and I liked all of the embellishments in that area.Finally, and as much as I hate to say it, I enjoyed the special effects of the remake (expecially in the last scene).  Did it seem to anyone else that, in Ringu, Sadako looked rather... clean?  Just my opinion.Point is- both had good, creepy atmosphere, and good storylines.  Scenes from the remake are, in my opinion, done better.  Acting in the remake suffers, and this takes MUCH away from the overall movie.  Acting in the original is superb- top-notch; therefore, the rest of the movie is very enjoyable, and make up for the places where special effects, etc. were used in the remake and subsequently seem to lack when watching the original.My advice: see both, and don't make up your mind about one until you HAVE seen both.  You will not be bored: they are hardly similar.  I really think that how you will view these movies depend on what you appreciate in cinema- I appreciate art and cinematography, which was embellished in the remake, but I also appreciate subtlety and ambiguity, which is rampant in the original (not to say that both don't contain some of the other...).  Both approaches to the story are very intriguing.

735158,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B000088NQR,Jonathan Appleseed,"[3, 3]","When I saw the The Ring, I enjoyed it, but was also unsatisfied. The contents of the mysterious tape seemed arbitrary to me, and the randomly arranged images didn't make sense (my litmus test for anything that falls into the speculative range of fiction or film). When I saw Ringu, I understood much better. A little internet research on Japanese ghost stories was also helpful. Japanese ghosts are called yrei, and there are subgroups within. Specific to this movie is the subgroup onry - ghosts that are bound to the material word to avenge a wrong done to them while they were alive.In Ringu, the contents of the tape are very specific, and each segment is relevant to something that happens, or has happened, in the story arc (the arc reaching well back in time). Most important, of course, was the discovery made by Asakawa (the reporter) regarding what I thought were floating letters, or moveable type. In reality, it was a newspaper article, and spoke of an eruption of a volcano on Oshima Island foretold by Sadako's mother, Shizuko. This article is what leads Asakawa and her ex-husband, Ryuji (who, in the book, I understand, was only her friend) to go to Oshima.(I'm going to forego initial plot summations, and assume that most either have read such summaries or are familiar enough that it's not necessary.)While on Oshima, Ryuji confronts Dr. Ikuma, and they speak of Shizuko's paranormal abilities and her sadness. Ryuji acknowledges having similar talents, and indeed, when he grasps the wrist of a fallen Dr. Ikuma, he sees Shizuko's ESP experiment where the reporters gathered called her a fraud, and one reporter died, with the same look of fear and horror that everyone else who has died after seeing the tape. Asakawa also witnesses this, though I don't know quite how that was managed, and after the reporter fell to his death, she witnessed a young girl in a white dress with long black hair running away. Shizuko shouted out after the girl - ""Sadako!""The white dress and long black hair are also important to Japanese ghost stories. White is (was?) the traditional funeral garb in Japan, and the unkempt black hair comes from Kabuki theater wear characters where different style wigs to identify themselves to the audience.I found Ryuji's paranormal abilities too convenient. I mean, come on. A reporter is investigating deaths of teens that watched a tape. Her niece was one of them. Her ex-husband just happens to be one of the few people that can help lead her to the answers she *thinks* she needs. I like things wrapped up a little tighter than that. Coincidence does not a convincing film make.(Don't read further if you haven't seen the film.)Another thing that bothered me was the scene at the well. To assume that they needed to go back to the cabin where the first teens viewed the tape was a bit of a leap. Not much - I can accept that leap given the reasons Asakawa supplied, but it was still a bit of a leap, especially after accepting the leap of Ryuji's abilities. Also, they have assumed that to ""rescue"" Sadako's corpse from the well will quiet her, and end her vengeance. I admit to lacking a great familiarity with Japanese ghost stories, or Japanese horror, but even if we accept that this is something accepted as generally understood, then there's this: First, why was Ryuji in the bottom of the well *first*, forcing Asakawa (much thinner, frailer, weaker) to be the one to pull up the heavy buckets of water; Second, and far more important, why didn't Ryuji just kick around and try to find the corpse by himself? When he lowered himself to the bottom of the well, he was able to stand fully erect. It was a small well. One or two soft nudges with his foot would have found the corpse. As disgusting as it sounds, he could have closed his eyes, dived down in the shallow water, and come up with Sadako's skeleton.It could be argued that I'm demanding something from J-horror that it will never provide because it doesn't want to: common sense. That's fine. But a bit more effort and I'll bet the filmmakers could have come up with something to tie everything up a bit neater, and made it a better film. But I'm not complaining, as much as it may seem like it. I enjoyed the film immensely. It was my first experience to non-Hollywood horror, and the lack of black cats was almost enough to make this a five star experience. Indeed, there was very little of anything to frighten us in this movie, other than the atmosphere created by the events. When you watch a movie that can do that to you, you're watching a good movie.It's odd to note that the American film tried to make a more cohesive story, and one that didn't rely on what I'm terming coincidence, but instead created something more confusing. The only thing I preferred in the American version was the ""final TV scene"". When I saw that in the theater, that was seriously creepy. It's been quite a while since anything made me squirm.",4,Many unanswered questions - but that's OK - a very original and welcome entry to the horror genre,1176422400,"04 13, 2007",2007,4942,"['When',

735160,A2YN8EO8E0T8I2,B000088NQR,joshua,"[1, 2]","I saw this movie before it was recently remade by Hollywood. Since it never received a real release in North America I watched ""Ringu"" (which was then translated ""the Ring"" but now I guess the American remakes takes title precedence) with a friend who owns an impressive collection of Japanese bootleg films. But now that Hollywood has released its inferior simulacra the American corporations have now deemed that ""Ringu"" would be profitable.This ideology of remaking foreign films that were never widely distributed in North America has always bugged me.  Hollywood is out of new ideas (and has been for a long time) and so it has recently begun remaking films from its past or, better yet, stealing ideas from foreign filmmakers hoping that an ethnocentric audience will think that the American filmmakers are ""original"" or ""inventive"". (Other recent examples include ""Solaris"" [yes I know it was a book by Lem, but it is obvious that the film was actually a remake of Tarkovsky's ""Solaris"" and I doubt the director actually read the book], and ""Insomnia"".)

Cockrel,"[4, 7]","The obvious problem created by the American DVD release of the 1998 Japanese film, ""Ringu"" is that most American viewers with interest in seeing it will have already seen ""The Ring"" prior to watching the original version.While there is clearly a debate over whether or not the original is better than last year's American remake, comparing the films is ultimately pointless given how similar they are.Unlike many remakes that use the original source material strictly as a jumping off point to go in a slightly or vastly different direction (think Steven Soderbergh's remake of ""Ocean's Eleven""), ""The Ring"" is essentially a shot by shot remake of ""Ringu.""  In fact, some of the ""cursed"" video footage used in ""The Ring"" actually seems to have been lifted directly from the earlier film.This isn't necessarily a bad thing but many American viewers seeing ""Ringu"" for the first time will undoubtedly experience a sense of ""been there, done that.""The remake, with its vastly superior makeup and special effects budget, clearly ups the ante on the gore quotient in comparison with the micro-budgeted Japanese version.  Additionally, ""The gray, rainy Seattle setting of ""The Ring"" does more to create an atmosphere of omnipresent dread than the often sunny, urban Japanese locale of the original.But ""Ringu"" is still an extremely competent and well-made film that delivers its own scares on a shoestring budget. In fact, I actually appreciated the subtlety of the Japanese original's horror to the occasionally ham-fisted shocks of ""The Ring.""For a really fun night, get some open-minded friends together and watch both movies back to back.  I guarantee you'll have a ball comparing the similarities and differences between the two versions.My only complaint is that this US release, which has clearly been timed to coincide with the DVD release of ""The Ring,""(both versions have been issued by Dreamworks) is woefully short on extras.

Bernabo,"[2, 3]","By the time I saw &quot;The Ring&quot; I was aware that the 2002 film was based on this 1998 Japanese film, which in turn was a remake of an earlier television project that was based on a book.  However, for most of us this movie is as far back as we are going to be able to follow the trail.  The main thing is to warn you not to watch &quot;Ringu&quot; and &quot;The Ring&quot; (or &quot;The Ring&quot; and &quot;Ringu&quot;) back to back.  I made that mistake with &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; and &quot;Point of No Return&quot; and would hate for anybody to do a repeat with another set of Foreign Original/American Remake.  For that matter, do not watch &quot;The Ring&quot; and &quot;FearDotCom&quot; back to back.  Wait a while (say, oh, I don't know, seven days...).The story revolves around an urban legend about videotape: if you watch it, you die seven days later.  That is apparently what happened to four young friends, although reporter Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima) finds this hard to believe.  But then she watches the tape and the clock has started ticking.  Leaving her precocious son at home, she is aided by her ex-husband in uncovering the mystery of the videotape.  Is there a rationale explanation behind this videotape of death?  Not in the real world sense, but there are rules to the game in &quot;Ringu&quot; and as with &quot;The Ring&quot; the most interesting part is how the reporter unravels the vague clues found in the bizarre images on the videotape in her race to save her life (and those of others).  You can make your own judgment as to whether or not the payoff is worth the journey; in that sense ""Ringu"" reminds me of ""Apocalypse Now,"" where the journey was so great that the payoff could not possible be as good as what we anticipated.I think most American viewers will have a preference for &quot;The Ring&quot; over &quot;Ringu,&quot; and not just because they would not have to deal with reading subtitles (&quot;Ringu&quot; is not dubbed, nor does it appear likely that it ever will be).  Most of Reiko's key scenes involve a minimum of dialogue and rely more on the look of horror on her face, so it is not like you are really distracted by reading anything at key moments.  You will probably be struck by the more minimalist use of humor in this film.  But &quot;The Ring&quot; is basically &quot;Ringu&quot; crossed with a Nine Inch Nails music video (you know exactly which one I have in mind), although this refers more to the images on the videotape.  The American version has more images, which are more bizarre, and a bigger budget for making the climax gorier.Of course it is difficult not to always be comparing the two films when you watch &quot;Ringu,&quot; but you will at least find it interesting.  How many Japanese horror movies have you seen lately?  How many of you have seen a Japanese film that was not anime or Akira Kurosawa?  You should be watching those (&quot;Spirited Away&quot; and &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; for the former, &quot;Rashomon&quot; and &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; for the latter), but you should be checking out films like &quot;Ringu&quot; as well.",4,The orignal Japanese theatrical film of the &quot;cursed video&quot;,1059696000,"08 1, 2003",2003,3146,"['time', 'saw', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'was', 'aware', '2002', 'film', 'was', 'based', '1998', 'Japanese', 'film', 'turn', 'was', 'remake', 'earlier', 'television', 'project', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'However', 'most', 'movie', 'far', 'back', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'trail', 'main', 'thing', 'warn', 'not', 'watch', 'quot', 'Ringu', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ringu', 'quot', 'back', 'back', 'made', 'mistake', 'quot', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'quot', 'quot', 'Point', 'No', 'Return', 'quot', 'would', 'hate', 'anybody', 'do', 'repeat', 'set', 'Foreign', 'Original/American', 'Remake', 'matter', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'quot', 'FearDotCom', 'quot', 'back', 'back', 'Wait', 'while', 'say', 'oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'seven', 'days', '.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'urban', 'legend', 'videotape', 'watch', 'die', 'seven', 'days', 'later', 'apparently', 'what', 'happened', 'four', 'young', 'friends', 'reporter', 'Reiko', 'Asakawa', 'Nanako', 'Matsushima', 'hard', 'believe', 'then', 'tape', 'clock', 'started', 'ticking', 'Leaving', 'precocious', 'son', 'home', 'aided', 'ex-husband', 'uncovering', 'mystery', 'videotape', 'there', 'rationale', 'explanation', 'videotape', 'death', 'Not', 'real', 'world', 'sense', 'are', 'rules', 'game', 'quot', 'Ringu', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'how', 'reporter', 'vague', 'clues', 'found', 'bizarre', 'images', 'videotape', 'race', 'save', 'life', 'others', 'can', 'make', 'own', 'judgment', 'not', 'payoff', 'journey', 'sense', 'Ringu', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'where', 'journey', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'payoff', 'could', 'not', 'possible', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'what', 'anticipated.I', 'think', 'most', 'American', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'preference', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ringu', 'quot', 'not', 'just', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'deal', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'quot', 'Ringu', 'quot', 'not', 'dubbed', 'appear', 'likely', 'ever', 'will', 'be', 'Most', 'Reiko', 'key', 'scenes', 'involve', 'minimum', 'dialogue', 'rely', 'more', 'look', 'horror', 'face', 'not', 'are', 'really', 'distracted', 'reading', 'anything', 'key', 'moments', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'struck', 'more', 'minimalist', 'use', 'humor', 'film', 'quot', 'Ring', 'quot', 'basically', 'quot', 'Ringu', 'quot', 'crossed', 'Nine', 'Inch', 'Nails', 'music', 'video', 'know', 'exactly', 'one', 'have', 'mind', 'more', 'images', 'videotape', 'American', 'version', 'more', 'images', 'are', 'more', 'bizarre', 'bigger', 'budget', 'making', 'climax', 'gorier.Of', 'course', 'difficult', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'comparing', 'two', 'films', 'when', 'watch', 'quot', 'Ringu', 'quot', 'will', 'least', 'find', 'interesting', 'How', 'many', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'lately', 'How', 'many', 'have', 'seen', 'Japanese', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'anime', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'should', 'be', 'watching', 'quot', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'quot', 'quot', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'quot', 'former', 'quot', 'Rashomon', 'quot', 'quot', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'quot', 'latter', 'should', 'be', 'checking', 'out', 'films', 'quot', 'Ringu', 'quot', 'as', 'well']",N/A

After watching it a couple times again I was truly chilled by it, gaining a better understanding of the story and I heard that the Japanese version was better so I invested in the entire set, Ring, Ring 2 and Ring 0...I have to say after seeing the Ring (I've heard you should buy this version, the version I bought was a poor transfer, a little too dark at times...) amd Ringu that Ringu is the superior film. It just is. The Ring is good and chilling but the story of Ringu is far better.For example the story of Sadako's mother makes MORE sense as to why she is the way she is than does the story of Samara. Sadako inherited powers from her mother, where as Samara was just bothered by her mother's horses. Samara's paternity is never addressed where as in Ringu Sadako's is hinted at and the idea is terrifying.There were few special effects in this movie and I guess if you can't get scared unless everything is super fancy then this is not the movie for you. I however thought the lack of special effects made the movie seem more real and made it scarier to me. The Ring was all grey looking so it seemed to be going on in a way where it couldn't happen to you, because our world doesn't look like that. However it's the opposite in Ringu where everything is very natural and normal looking.I also think the famous out the tv scene was ruined in the American version because of all the stupid pointless special effects in that. The Japanese scene is far more chilling, and the reporter's son is more interesting and engaging than the Sixth Sense boy in the Ring.I also preferred the couple. Reiko and Ryuji were more convincing together than the American couple. They had better chemistry and Ryuji was more involved right away from the start and a lot less of a doubting Thomas.Basically, the Japanese movie seems more original and terrifying in my opinion, where as the American version tries too hard with it's CGI and falls desperately short.

Things get off to a bad start with the opening teaser, a slow-burning 'scare' scene which builds toward nothing more than a lacklustre freeze-frame, ruining the intended effect, and the subsequent narrative relies too heavily on mood to be truly effective. Nakata generates tension through a gradual accumulation of details, as Matsushima and Sanada follow a series of clues to a remote island where they uncover the identity of a 'character' in the cursed video, whose restless spirit seeks vengeance for a past transgression. The movie closes on a scene of stunning, visceral horror (impressionable viewers are warned that this sequence is PROFOUNDLY frightening), but it's the only highlight of an otherwise mediocre movie.

Screenplay writer Hiroshi Takahashi then introduces her ex-husband, Koichi (Katsimi Muramatsu) as the other lead.  The film gains considerable intensity as a result of the relationship between the two in their efforts to save themselves and their young son Yoichi (Takashi Yamamura).The primary plot device, a video tape which contains a series of mystical sequences and clues.  Watching it brings on a mysterious curse that kills in exactly seven days.  Reiko and Koichi must peel back layer after layer of mystery in an effort to discover why a resort hotel always seems to have a copy of this tape on hand.  And why a volcanic eruption 40 years before has triggered a string of horrible deaths.While the film differs in many places from the book it has an immediacy and vividness that the book, with its procedural narration, seemed to lack.  This happens slowly, and the initial scenes of the film after the opening death of the first high school student drag a bit.  Director Hideo Nakata uses a light touch, depending on expressions and lighting to create horror rather than violence and gore.  There are still plenty of jarring moments, though.The book, however, does better with the motivations behind the tape, which the film leaves somewhat vague.  Of course, the story depends on the somewhat arbitrary nature of the evil behind the tape for its uneasiness.  The acting, by the way, completely overcomes the dubbing.  You often will know what is going on without any reference to the text.This is as close to an artistic Japanese horror film as I've seen.

I have to say that true to the other reviews, ""Ringu"" is truly creepy. A bizarre urban legend about a weird and deadly video tape is discovered to be (gulp) true. And a journalist (who watched it) is on a race for her life (and her young son's) to get to the source. With the help of her psychic ex-husband, she tracks it down to an even more bizarre series of events that happened 40 yrs.ago. This film does creep you out and without all the obnoxious special effects and gore. It sets you up for the chills right from the beginning and doesn't let up. But it does so with seemingly normal and mundane things like the telephone ringing after watching the video, the weird video cassette itself with no title, static images on a TV screen, schoolgirls who know that the urban legend is true because their friends have died horribly (and no telling how many adults who won't believe them) and it appears they've been scared to death. Maybe these things have been done before but hardly this well. It all seems so fresh in ""Ringu"" that you find yourself getting edgy. Marvelous directing and acting, beautiful photography and an excellent music score with just the right creepiness in it. I loved it. And I loved the ending. Highly recommended all around.

The flick is a few seconds in and we're at two teenage girls and counting.  And so I decide I'm gonna flip on Ringu and do a scene by scene comparison to see if maybe I should start watching Ringu instead.So I flip on Ringu on the VCR while I still got The Ring cooking on pause in the DVD.  I watch the first scene of Ringu, switch back to The Ring, watch another scene from Ringu, ditto for The Ring... you get the idea.  So pretty soon I come to the conclusion that the pictures are pretty much the same except the Japanese version is set in Japan and full of Japanese people speaking Japanese.  And another difference is that the teenage girl that gets worked over in the first scene, you know, after some shenanigans with the TV after she claims to her friend she saw the killer videotape and then changes her story and says she didn't?  Well, in the Japanese version, the nameless menace that kills her off seems to come out of her refrigerator.  And in both versions it is utterly unclear what the frig is going on.  I mean you have these teenage girls claiming first that they saw the killer tape, then making like it was all a put on, then they keel over and you're left with the feeling that maybe they were sincere when they said they saw the killer video but then started backpedaling for reasons unknown.  In the american version, the moribund girl has some bad dealings with the TV, then goes upstairs in search of her friend and opens the door to a bedroom to find the killer tape playing on the TV.  She drops dead.  Which is strange to me, since according to the legend, the tape is watched and then you keel over seven days later, mysteriously.  There was no mention of being subjected to the tape yet again.

In the process they anoint their audience with a lot more credit for being intelligent than do the Americans.Another interesting point is that, in the American version, the Naomi Watts character is the main protagonist while her ex is merely eye-candy.

735173,A2FM09EQVC5W6B,B000088NQR,Michelle,"[8, 16]","As an American teenager, I [not surprisingly] saw ""The Ring"" first and was so impressed with it that I later rented and viewed ""Ringu."" While in ""The Ring,"" almost every second of the movie is eerie and frightening in some way, only certain moments of ""Ringu"" did I find to be absolutely terrifying. Now, we must understand that because this film was created first, its makers receive the credit for the whole ""cursed film that kills you in seven days by a creepy girl in a well"" concept. Also, it had the tough job of laying the foundation for such a story. When ""Ringu"" was adapted into ""The Ring,"" it was elaborated on and made scarier. Since I saw ""The Ring"" first, it's no shock or disappointment to me that this one didn't scare me quite as much. After ""The Ring,"" I honestly wasn't expecting it. I don't think I'll ever see a scarier movie than ""The Ring.""""Ringu"" begins much the same way; a strange little boy, his mother, and his father-who-doesn't-act-like-a-father are the stars. The boy's female teenage cousin is killed by the tape. The mother investigates and watches it herself--unwittingly committing suicide. Almost, that is. From there, however, the details are far different. The video in ""Ringu"" is less than half as long as the one in ""The Ring"" and is at least thirty times less chilling and upsetting. It contains few of the same images; no flies, no spinning chair, no ladder. We see only the woman brushing her hair in the mirror, some rather large men, a person with a white cap on their head, and the well. Few of these images are clearly explained (which isn't a problem, since it leaves some mystery to the imagination), but after the video in ""The Ring,"" it was slightly disappointing. The story goes that a good psychic woman (Anna Morgan's counterpart) has a daughter who is an evil psychic who kills people just by wishing their death. Her name is Sadako (in the new version, Samara). Her mother commits suicide. Her father pushes her down the well. She creates the video and begins spreading her wrath through it.None of the terrifying images in ""The Ring""'s grainy, bluish-tinted video would make sense in ""Ringu."" Nor do they ever stretch the tape and pull out a living creature. Nosebleeds and scribbled-out faces play no part in ""Ringu."" Blurry photographs and reflections do. Some elements were kept the same, others were altered. Like I said, some parts of this movie were just not as suspenseful. Others, like Sadako's attack of Ryuji (Asakawa, the main character's, ex-husband, and Yoichi, the little boy's, father), are very, very scary indeed. Sadako is every bit as menacing as Samara. Her eye is even scarier than Samara's--however, once out of the TV, she does not have the ""digital"", grainy, bluish appearance of the video.Once dead, the victims in ""Ringu"" simply look afraid, and dead. They don't have that gnarly, twisted, revolting look they were given in the later movie. But again, this was the foundation, not the elaboration, and I respect that. Yoichi had a smaller role than did Aidan. He was not as ""in-tune"" with Sadako as Aidan was with Samara. There was no ranch, no horses, no ladder or barn for him to know about. The music and scenery were also less frightening than in ""The Ring."" Sadako's mother was very interested in the sea, for some not-very-significant reason. Down in the well, Asakawa and Ryuji try to lift the curse. (They find her fingernails, stuck in the sides from climbing out.) They find Sadako's body. Of course, it turns out that Ryuki still must die; the only way to save yourself is to copy the tape and show it to someone else.Overall, this movie was pleasing, enjoyable, and most of all: scary! But, I would have liked it more if was longer, more detailed, and dealt with more symbols. Even though Rachel's quest in ""The Ring"" was very well-explained and almost seemed simple to figure out, it didn't come across that way. And honestly, in this film it wasn't any more difficult to find the well or figure anything out. The main characters just didn't get led around in a big circle during the mystery. There was one part that made little sense: Ryuji sits in the park, sees a pair of woman's feet in white shoes, and asks, ""Was it you? Did you do this?"" or something. It wasn't terribly scary and didn't fit in. So basically, this movie gets the credit for starting the whole ""Ring"" story. But it could have stood to be better--and then an adapted version might not have been necessary. For example, we could have seen more of Sadako's story. We see Samara being interviewed at the hospital. We also see Becka, the dead cousin's friend, in a mental hospital.I know I've been comparing the two movies this whole time.

735174,A2WZ3OKU6H716Y,B000088NQR,miles@riverside,"[5, 6]","Creepy film.  Not very bloody at all for a horror film:  the scares come from psychological tension and an intriguing story.  I like how they used scenes from the ""killer"" video as clues in uncovering the mystery (or part of it) behind the curse.  Reminds me just a little of photographs in the Antonioni movie BLOW UP.  Also, the ""false"" reflections the girl sees in the blank TV screens were a disturbing effect; you start seeing your own reflection while you're watching (unless you have one of those nonreflecting flat-screen TVs, I suppose).I saw the U.S. version THE RING first, so that one probably affects my perceptions of RINGU more than the other way around.  Hard to review one without comparing it to the other.  This one has somewhat less plot and fewer scare scenes than the THE RING does, but I don't think that lessens it any.  The U.S. version has nicer, weirder visual effects and flashbacks, and its complex backstory behind the curse is more involving (I thought).  But that kid in the U.S. version reminded me too much of the kid in THE SIXTH SENSE.  And I thought that the increased number of foreshadowing (or backshadowing?) scenes in the U.S. film stole just a little bit from the big scene with the girl crawling out of the well; whereas the Japanese version has fewer scare scenes along the way, so the big scene hits you with more impact.  Also, I thought the crippled motion of the girl in the Japanese version (when she walks toward the screen) is more unsettling than what we see in the U.S. version; as is how we never see her face at all in the Japanese version.  But they're both clever horror films; if you like one you'll probably like the other.Couple interesting notes:  A little web browsing reveals that the RING movies, novels, manga, and TV series have evolved into a whole minor industry in Japan.

735175,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000088NQR,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","""Ringu"" is a supernatural thriller based on Koji Suzuki's novel of the same name. This film adaptation has spawned two Japanese sequels and an American remake, with more to come, and was a seminal work in the ongoing Asian horror film craze that began in the late 1990s. ""Ringu"" is more a paranormal mystery than a horror film, though. It's not even remotely a splatter film, so those who like creepy but don't like blood may enjoy it.A story about a cursed video is making the rounds of high schools. Supposedly, anyone who watches it dies one week later. The video has become the stuff of urban legend. A reporter, Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima), who is investigating the rumors, intensifies her research when she learns that a young relative of hers has died mysteriously after seeing the legendary video. In the course of her investigation, Reiko watches the video and begins to fear for her own life and that of her young son. She enlists the help of her ex-husband, Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada), in analyzing the cryptic film. Together, they race against the clock, searching for clues to the video's origin.""Ringu"" is spooky rather than scary. It sometimes relies on gimmicks -such as the expiration date placed on anyone who sees the video- and on inconsistencies to move the story forward. It's not sophisticated. But the characters are likable. And ""Ringu"" succeeds in engaging the audience's interest in discovering the mysteries of the video. The film has a slow middle section, when Reiko and Ryuji are analyzing the tape. But the tedium lends the story a  bit of realism, so may actually help create a sense of plausibility. ""Ringu"" recycles elements from other films and books, but it does a pretty good job of it. It's not innovative, but ""Ringu"" is an entertaining thriller with an attractive cast.

It was worldfamous before it was even released. The concept was pretty freaky of course: when you watched this cursed video tape the phone would ring and a voice would say: Seven days, meaning you would die in ehm... yeah that's right, seven days. What some (or many, I don't really know actually) people don't know is that The Ring is a remake. The original Ring is a 1998 Japanese movie, but because Americans are too lazy to read subtitles plus the fact that a great part of them is too nationalist too withstand foreigners longer than an hour, this movie was remade into, yup, The Ring.The original movie was based on the book Ring, by writer Suzuki Koji. The book was made into a tv-series at first in 1995. The series was named Ring: Kanzen-ban, but it was quite a disaster. In 1998 Nakata Hideo made a second attempt. This attempt was this movie, called 'Ring', after the book (Ringu in Japanese). And it turned out great, I can tell you. Although the book's story was changed here and there (and here, and there) these interventions didn't do the story any harm. The changes were drastic though; in the book Sadako was a sort of virus, in the movie she's a real girl. In the book the main character was a man, in the movie a woman. Talk about drastic changes! But as said, this wasn't bad. Not bad at all.The storyline in short: There have been rumours that there's a cursed video somewhere, and everyone who watches it will get a phonecall. And seven days later, you'll die. When Reiko's (the main character) niece dies in a strange way after having seen the movie, Reiko (being a journalist) tries to find out more about this. She actually finds a weird tape and watches it. The images on the tape are disturbing and when the tape ends, the phone rings! Scary as hell! Of course Reiko has no intention of dying yet so she tries to stop the curse. This is just the plot in short and if it doesn't sound very creepy, believe me, this movie is!

It's boring, uninteresting, has little, if any, character development, and delivers no creepiness or scares.  The acting is wooden, one character reveals his powerful psychic powers (which would have been hella useful earlier!) in the middle of the movie for no apparent reason, deus ex machina style.  Then they're never referred to again.  That's not just bad writing, it's silly.  Everybody raves about this movie like it's actually frightening, or at least somewhat creepy.  I had a hard time making out any plot whatsoever, and the ""big scary part!"" is a snore.  And I'm sorry to burst more bubbles here, but the soggy chick with rolled back eyes is not scary at all.  It's not even remotely creepy.  It was actually painful to watch, but only because I had to reconcile myself with the fact that Japan is so absolutely in love with this garbage.There was one redeeming quality to this film - the scene where Sadako is clubbed and thrown into the well.  It is absolutely hysterical!  Initially, we see a still shot of Sadako standing like an idiot staring down a well.  Out of nowhere, Sadako's mother runs full-tilt into frame with a 2x4 or something and whacks her daughter over the head.  The sound effect used at that moment is the funniest thing I have ever heard in a movie.  ""THWACK!""  Now that's comedy!  I couldn't stop laughing when I saw that.  I'm certain it wasn't meant to be funny, either, which only makes it funnier in my opinion.This movie is trash.  It's a complete trainwreck that all Japanese teenagers agreed to think was cool simultaneously, en masse, which is basically how Japanese pop-culture is directed these days.  I dare you to find niche films in Japan.  Heck, independant music taste is even harder.  There's a reason ""idoru"" (meaning ""idol"") is a term in Japan.  Everybody decides that something is awesome, and then as soon as the next awesome thing comes along they drop the old one and flock to the new.  Ringu is like that, the latest awesome thing in horror films.The American version of this film is EVEN WORSE.

735178,A2ASL6DAC9UY02,B000088NQR,Nnie the Hideous New Girl,"[6, 7]","Ringu is not The Ring.  It is the original film which The Ring is a remake of.  Ringu does not have the flash, the flare, and the shocks that The Ring has, but this film does not need any of that to effectively creep out its viewers.  It is a quiet film that slowly goes about explaining itself, while refraining from answering all the questions to the story.  The viewer is meant not to know everything about the shady past from which the cursed video tape came from.The important thing, however, is the race to solve the mystery of the tape before its too late.  As legend goes, once you watch it, you only have seven days to live.  Reiko Asakawa, a single mother and reporter, watches the tape and must hurry to save herself and the lives of those she shows the tape to.  The story is very similar to that of The Ring, but The Ring elaborates greatly on Ringu.  The cast for Ringu is very strong.  Much stronger, in my opinion, than the cast for the Ring.  The people seemed more realistic, more natural, except that we are let on to one of the characters having psychic abilities.  Luckily, it's not the little boy.Now comes the million dollar question.  What's scarier, The Ring, or Ringu?  It all depends on which you see first.  These movies are so similar, once you've seen one, you know how the other will turn out.  Some may find it easier to jump during The Ring however, due to all the added special effects.  There are no flashy effects and loud noises in Ringu.  The fear is much more subtle than that.  Still, while I myself saw The Ring first, it was hard not to get creeped out by Sadako's twitchy, jerking movements as she slinked across the room.",5,A Subtle Film,1049587200,"04 6, 2003",2003,1665,"['Ringu', 'not', 'Ring', 'original', 'film', 'Ring', 'remake', 'Ringu', 'not', 'have', 'flash', 'flare', 'shocks', 'Ring', 'film', 'not', 'need', 'effectively', 'creep', 'out', 'viewers', 'quiet', 'film', 'slowly', 'explaining', 'refraining', 'answering', 'questions', 'story', 'viewer', 'meant', 'not', 'know', 'everything', 'shady', 'past', 'cursed', 'video', 'tape', 'came', 'from.The', 'important', 'thing', 'however', 'race', 'solve', 'mystery', 'tape', 'too', 'late', 'legend', 'once', 'watch', 'only', 'have', 'seven', 'days', 'live', 'Reiko', 'Asakawa', 'single', 'mother', 'reporter', 'tape', 'must', 'hurry', 'save', 'lives', 'tape', 'story', 'very', 'similar', 'Ring', 'Ring', 'greatly', 'Ringu', 'cast', 'Ringu', 'very', 'strong', 'Much', 'stronger', 'opinion', 'cast', 'Ring', 'people', 'seemed', 'more', 'realistic', 'more', 'natural', 'are', 'let', 'one', 'characters', 'having', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'Luckily', 'not', 'little', 'boy.Now', 'million', 'dollar', 'question', 'What', 'scarier', 'Ring', 'Ringu', 'see', 'first', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'similar', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'know', 'how', 'other', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'may', 'find', 'easier', 'jump', 'Ring', 'however', 'due', 'added', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'flashy', 'effects', 'loud', 'noises', 'Ringu', 'fear', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'Still', 'saw', 'Ring', 'first', 'was', 'hard', 'not', 'get', 'creeped', 'out', 'Sadako', 'twitchy', 'jerking', 'movements', 'slinked', 'room']",N/A
735179,A1A5633MK8F1VN,B000088NQR,Peter,"[35, 44]","I saw The Ring the other night and gave it a 2 star rating as one of the most over-hyped movies in a long time. I'm glad i saw it, though, and enjoyed the creepy mood and atmosphere of it, but i didn't think it was the scariest movie of all time like so many of the five star reviews were saying.  I had a big problem with how the movie was hard to figure out in parts and there were many unanswered questions that left me with an unsatisfied feeling. Plus, i didn't buy the explaination for how the images got on the tape at all. Thankfully, i was able to see Ringu, which had the effect of fixing the focus on a blurry picture and making everything crystal clear. Not only was Ringu a better story and went in a different and more enjoyable direction than the story The Ring was trying to tell, but it all made 100% sense by the end of the movie and cleared up all the unanswered questions i'd had about The Ring. The explaination in Ringu for the reason behind the images appearing on the tape was believable. Also, Ringu didn't drag the way The Ring did. Technically, The Ring looked better, but that was only because of the millions of dollars difference in the budget. Considering Ringu was made on a shoestring budget, i'd say they did a great job of it. The scene where the girl comes through the tv made sense in Ringu due to the different approach to the story and the explaination of things, whereas in The Ring it just looked like a Hollywood afterthought that was tagged on for shock purposes. The way it was done in Ringu was also ten times  scarier than in The Ring, and the music during that part was scarier too. Ringu also helped explain the epilogue in The Ring that had made no sense to me at all. I really didn't like the way the story was handled and altered in The Ring. They added parts to it that just ended up confusing me. My advice would be to skip The Ring totally and watch Ringu instead. It may not be Hollywood material for all you people who depend on cgi effects and huge big budgets, but the story of Ringu is much more enjoyable to follow and made a hell of a lot more sense than The Ring.",4,Better than the American version.,1046822400,"03 5, 2003",2003,2125,"['saw', 'Ring', 'other', 'night', 'gave', '2', 'star', 'rating', 'one', 'most', 'over-hyped', 'movies', 'long', 'time', ""'m"", 'glad', 'i', 'saw', 'though', 'enjoyed', 'creepy', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'scariest', 'movie', 'time', 'so', 'many', 'five', 'star', 'reviews', 'were', 'saying', 'had', 'big', 'problem', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'parts', 'were', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'left', 'unsatisfied', 'feeling', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'explaination', 'how', 'images', 'got', 'tape', 'Thankfully', 'i', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'Ringu', 'had', 'effect', 'fixing', 'focus', 'blurry', 'picture', 'making', 'everything', 'crystal', 'clear', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'Ringu', 'better', 'story', 'went', 'different', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'direction', 'story', 'Ring', 'was', 'trying', 'tell', 'made', '100', '%', 'sense', 'end', 'movie', 'cleared', 'up', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'i', ""'d"", 'had', 'Ring', 'explaination', 'Ringu', 'reason', 'images', 'appearing', 'tape', 'was', 'believable', 'Also', 'Ringu', 'did', ""n't"", 'drag', 'way', 'Ring', 'did', 'Technically', 'Ring', 'looked', 'better', 'was', 'only', 'millions', 'dollars', 'difference', 'budget', 'Considering', 'Ringu', 'was', 'made', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'i', ""'d"", 'say', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'scene', 'where', 'girl', 'tv', 'made', 'sense', 'Ringu', 'due', 'different', 'approach', 'story', 'explaination', 'things', 'whereas', 'Ring', 'just', 'looked', 'Hollywood', 'afterthought', 'was', 'tagged', 'shock', 'purposes', 'way', 'was', 'done', 'Ringu', 'was', 'also', 'ten', 'times', 'scarier', 'Ring', 'music', 'part', 'was', 'scarier', 'too', 'Ringu', 'also', 'helped', 'explain', 'epilogue', 'Ring', 'had', 'made', 'sense', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'way', 'story', 'was', 'handled', 'altered', 'Ring', 'added', 'parts', 'just', 'ended', 'up', 'confusing', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'skip', 'Ring', 'totally', 'watch', 'Ringu', 'instead', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'material', 'people', 'who', 'depend', 'cgi', 'effects', 'huge', 'big', 'budgets', 'story', 'Ringu', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'follow', 'made', 'hell', 'lot', 'more', 'sense', 'Ring']",N/A

Many of the parts are very, very much alike.  But what a lot of people hated were the sub titles.  I personally would rather have subtitles then bad voice overs where the actors mouths arent even moving with the words.  Another thing is people say that it is boring.  Well, if you think that this is boring, then you should think that &quot;The Ring&quot; is boring too, because it is like I said, pretty much the exact same story.&quot;Ringu&quot; is a little more creepy in my eyes.  The music, which there isnt much of, is more on the lines of Kubricks &quot;The Shining&quot;.  Also, as I said before, the story is a little different.  I actually liked the story a little better than that of the American version.  Although, the only reason they are different i think, is because of the different cultures and areas that we live in.

My ignorance led me to make the ROOKIE MISTAKE of watching Ringu.......alone.I am old enough to remember when Bruce Willis had hair but for the next few nights, I slept (well, tried to sleep) with the light on like the thumb-sucking baby it reduced me to.

As you probably know from the American remake, it's about a reporter who stumbles across a videotape that kills all who watch it. The remake was a good movie, but it just didn't inspire the same primal emotions or incorporate the same wit as the original.This film is as smart as George Romero's Dawn of the Dead and as scary as Silence of the Lambs. Televisions and telephones create an ominous presence whenever appearing in a scene. The TVs are a personification of evil as effective as Hannibal Lector. After seeing the film, I actually had slight nightmares about being attacked by my TV.The mass influx of news stories in different versions lead to the depletion of information overall. The main characters struggle, even the psychic, to discover the truth about the tapes origins within the week they have left. Rumors seem true, then false, then turn out true, and no one knows who to believe.In a world where mass hysteria stems from overloaded misinformation, we are forced to ask ourselves, should I pass that chain letter and condemn the recipient to its consequences, or should I sacrifice myself to end it.

735183,A36L47A45ZF3WP,B000088NQR,"R. Grubb ""Malevolent Child""","[10, 10]","I think it's difficult to write a review for this movie without comparing and contrasting it with the US remake, but I will do my best.  In my opinion, neither film is perfect.  Some things worked better in Ringu, and some things worked better in The Ring.  But what I loved about both films is the way that both stories are different from each other, so that you can watch both and get something out of each one.The new trend of remaking Asian horror films seems to come from this movie.  I can't understand why people get so upset about it, though.  For one thing, before the remake, it was impossible to get the original in America.  If you think this is such a great movie, why wouldn't you want more people to see it?  Also, with all the films Hideo Nakata has made, this is by no means his best work.  Most people I hear complaining about the American remake have never even seen anything else he's ever done.  Most importantly, with this film in particular, a remake is a very fitting choice, because it actually fits into the context of the story.  I can't elaborate on that, but when you see it, you'll understand what I mean.The story centers around Asakawa, her son Yoichi, and her ex-husband Ryuji.  Asakawa is a reporter investigating rumors surrounding a mysterious video tape that local youths have been saying will kill the viewer one week after watcing it.  The inquiries take on a more personal meaning for her when her niece turns up dead under unexplained circumstances.  After a bit of poking around, Asakawa finds herself in the presence of the killer videotape.  So what does she do?  Of course she watches it!  Now that may not sound like the smart thing to do in a situation like this.  At least the other unsuspecting victims watched it by mistake.  But you know how those snoopy reporters are.  If you found a copy of a videotape that killed people, wouldn't you at least want to know what was on it?Unfortnunately, the payoff isn't that great.  The videotape is a mishmash of weird yet boring images, and if I had turned in something like that for my experimental film project in ""Film Analysis: Formalist and Feminist"" class, I would not have passed.  Once Asakawa has gotten over her initial curiosity, she freaks out and calls Ryuji to help her find out what she can do to break that curse.The main problem I have with this film is the character of Ryuji.  He is fascinating, and the actor playing him is very talented.  However, his character has had such a great arc from the novel, to the film, to the remake, that it seems that the screenwriter didn't know what to do with him.  In the novel, Asakawa is a man, and Ryuji is his detestable friend.  He despises humankind, and entertains Asakawa with stories about breaking into women's houses and raping them.  I think making Asakawa a female, and Ryuji her ex was a brilliant move.  They've got seven days to find the origin of the video tape, which is not nearly long enough to reconcile their personal differences.  However, his character had to undergo a great transformation between the novel and the film.  If they had him be as reprehensible as he was in the book, a strong female like Asakawa never would have had anything to do with him.  However, they had to keep some of his jerkiness in tact, because they were filming the sequel at the same time, and his evil nature played a part in it.  (This is ""Rasen,"" not ""Ring 2.""  ""Rasen"" is based on the second novel, but the movie turned out so crappy that Nakata had to make his own alternate sequel, ""Ring 2,"" which was a completely new idea.)So Ryuji appears here as somewhat of a contradiction between two selves.  And for some reason, they chose to give him psychic powers.  His psychic abilities were not in the novel, and I don't think they added anything to the story.  His powers allow the villian, a young woman named Sadako, to appear right in front of him when he's sitting on a park bench.  He remains calm, and actually speaks to her.  Then later, when they want to make him be scared, he is so scared that he can't move.  The character is interesting, but disjointed.  In the remake, the writer seemed to consider all of this, and made Noah, the ex, a complete flake, and somewhat of a coward.  His contribution was his expertise in video equipment, not a staggering intellect.It is difficult to say too much more about this film, as there is so much more to learn that I don't want to give away too soon.  But what works here is that the story makes use of modern technology intertwined with a traditional ghost story.  Televisions, VCR's, telephones, these are all modern inventions not usually associated with ghosts.  We don't typically put ghosts and technology together because they are otherworldly in death, and it is assumed that they came from a more primitive time in life, before these things were invented.  That's why a techno update of the ghost story works, because it scares us with things we never thought of as scary before.If you are a fan of the recent wave of Japanese horror, or the American version of The Ring, you owe it to yourself to see this film.  It should be noted that the famous scene near the end that everyone remembers from The Ring was not in the novel, but was an invention of Hideo Nakata.",4,A Japanese Horror Classic,1100390400,"11 14,

Rather as ""The Magnificent Seven"" was a slick, more effective than average American Western. But no comparison with ""The Seven Samurai"" which was like nothing you'd ever seen before. And so is this. Of course it's maybe a bit culturally correct always to prefer the subtitled original to the big budget Hollywood remake so perhaps I'm just kidding myself on. But then I ask myself how excited I am at the prospect of seeing Hideo Nakata's latest, ""Dark Water"", compared to how excited I am at the prospect of seeing ""Pirates of the Carribean"" and all such doubts vanish very, very fast.It is probably best to do as I did and watch the two versions in the right order, the first first. This was very hard for Americans, I gather, as the studio, having got their hands on the rights, took great pains to ensure nobody saw the Japanese version first.One joy of the Japanese version is that it is so much less tidy. It's a mystery story and as it unfolds we get a glimpse of the solution to the various riddles. But it's just that, a glimpse. Lose ends abound. What exactly is the significance of the figure in the video with a white hood covering his/her head? We aren't told: it's left to our imagination. As it should be. Perhaps for a satisfying crime mystery we want every neatly tied up. For a satisfying supernatural mystery we surely do not.See it anyway. It's probably one of the best four or five horror movies that have ever been made. It is infused with a uniquely strange and disturbing atmosphere. Silence is used to terrific effect. The picture is generally so drained of colour that when you remember it later you won't be sure it was in colour at all. The acting is excellent. Rikiya Otaka is particularly extraordinary as the little boy Yoichi.(This reviews the DVD but of course, given the story line, one really should watch it on video.

It caused so much rumors and news that it was truly a must for every movie (horror) fans.  First, it didn't use sound effect and too much special effect for creating the creeping atmosphere.  It used purely the edit and storyline to absorb you.  Second, the movie did not show a SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD, but it can have the same horrible effect to leave you unsleep for nights.  (I was truly scared when my phone rang at midnight during those months!!)  It teaches Hollywood how to make a good horror movie without using banging soundtrack and bloodshed.  Finally, please grab a copy of the original novel to read.The whole saga of RING has four parts - RING, RAISEN and LOOP (reprise the theme of 'circular' like RING) and BIRTHDAY.  For the movie - we have RINGU, RAISEN, RINGU 2, RINGU 0.  The author Suzuki-san mentioned in the introduction of RAISEN that it was very difficult for him to write a sequel to RINGU, since the first one has already got a very complicate plot.  But he sure can create a true mesmerizing sequel.In summary, RAISEN is about the rebirth of Sadako.  RINGU 2 (movie only) is a somewhat parallel sequel to RINGU, with a different splitting storyline after the movie of RINGU.  RINGU 0 is the prequel to RINGU and is about the life of Sadako as a child, which based on the book BIRTHDAY.  And for LOOP, it is a collection of short stories which talks about the widespread of RING virus, and probable termination of mankind.  Yes, in RING, you may believe that the deaths are caused by CURSE in the video tape.  But in RAISEN, the author cleverly developed the plot that RING is actually a virus triggered by the curse!!

735200,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B000088NQR,Zack Davisson,"[11, 14]","The title of the film, ""Ringu"" refers not to anything circular but to the ringing of the telephone that follows each viewing of the cursed video tape.  The telephone, with its harsh, sudden blare, has always been a vehicle of horror and suspense, from Agnes Morehead's classic and chilling ""Sorry, Wrong Number"" to its role in ""Scream."" The television has also been a portal for the unreal, in films such as ""Videodrome"" and ""Poltergeist.""  There is something about the flickering screen, the way a TV sucks in your attention and the possibility that something is watching from the other side of the screen that makes it as natural an element in a horror story as a grave or a well.""Ringu"" uses these elements, combining a feeling both modern and ancient, to tell a most excellent ghost story.  Ghost stories work best when they are subtle, creepy and manifest a feeling that something invisible is watching you just outside your field of vision, although possible in the same room as you.  This film has exactly that atmosphere, with patient Japanese storytelling drawing out the suspense to an unbeatable climax.The actors all do an excellent job, avoiding the Japanese penchant for over-the-top melodrama and delivering performances as subtle as the story.  Kabuki-trained Rie Inou makes the most of her onscreen time as Sadako. Nanako Matsushima is lovely and determined as the desperate reporter, hunting for the key that will save her's and her child's lives.  Hiroyuki Sanada is a cool character as Nanako's psychically sensitive husband.  Rikiya Otaka shows once again that few things are genuinely creepier than a little kid.Without revealing any of the story, I will say that some background knowledge of Japanese supernatural traditions would probably clear up some of the confusing points of the film.  Certain things are left unexplained, any more than an American film would explain why a vampire feared a wooden stake.  It is just assumed that everyone watching the movie will already know this.The ""Ringu"" DVD itself is disappointing, offering no features whatsoever and one would think that such an infamous film would get a better presentation.  Also, the subtitles are not very well done, and often do a lackluster job of transferring the meaning of the Japanese dialog.
