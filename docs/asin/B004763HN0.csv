Or any dance class, for that matter. Even though technt ique and posture is so critical to executing spins and turns correctly, I only remember being to watch, follow along, and for heaven's sake keep up with the class. I've taken a good toss during a turn and ended up with a fractured wrist, chipped cheekbone, and a cut at the corner of one eye - so I should know.I was pretty keen on seeing what the Turn it Up DVD from CheekyGirls Productions had to offer to see if I could finally pick up learning turns again because turns do magical things to belly dancing.Intermediate dancers should definitely consider this video if they haven't mastered spins and turns in actual classes yet. Dancer Summer Sahar knows her jazz and her ballet. On this video she shows you how to apply what she has learnt about turns from these genres to belly dancing. And she does a pretty good job of it.There isn't a warm up on this video, so when you start to work with it, go and do one of your own first. I'd say 10 to 15 mins of whatever you generally do to wake up the body and prepare for dancing should do. I'd avoid working with the video right after a long session of conditioning and other dance routines. You need your concentration and alertness to listen to your body when working with turns. That's my two cents anyway.We start our work with turns with the all important Spotting. The explanation is just fine here. What would have been better would have been some nice spotting drill because it's a dead boring thing to do on your own. Luckily, just a few rounds here and there begins to make a big big difference. A spotting drill would be quite appropriate, I think, on a turns dvd.Then we have those critical tips that were missing from my jazz class. How to hold the back, tuck the tummy, whether to have straight legs or slightly bent etc are taken up here.Summer is quite right in saying that it takes a lot of muscle to do turns. Any compromises on that and you end up with injuries. So, you grab a chair for balance and work on a set of very specific strength and balance exercises. Each exercise is done 2 or 3 times, but again, I think a nice drill would have helped. Cued, with music. I've done similar exercises using ballet conditioning videos and have seen that these can be beautifully drilled. Here we move rather quickly from one to the next and there's a slight fragmented feel. These exercises seemed to be filmed separately but would have been better in a smoother flow.  There are about 4 or 5 exercises.The turns instruction begins now and you have a whole lot of them to work through. Thirteen, to be precise. Summer explains each turn with a breakdown and safety and execution tips. The way to work with these would probably be to watch whichever one you're working with many many times, pause, go try it out gently, correct, and then practice several times. There's no separate practice while teaching the turns: that comes later. It would have been better to run through the turn a few times -- with some safety tips. The extent of breakdown too should have been a lot more. For example, I remember doing the compass turn in jazz class. It isn't enough to demo it once. Is the standing leg to be bent? Is there something you can do to avoid twisting your angle as you go around 360 degrees on one foot? How do you prepare your posture for each turn? These questions should have been taken up.Here again I'd have thought a practice session of some kind would have been useful, but on the other hand, if you were to do the lot in one drill, it would get anyone confused and dizzy. Still, I think to go through each turn say 5 times and then stop and go to the next would have been ideal.We get to a section on combinations next, and this is the real meat of the DVD. There are eight whole combinations - and they are not to be sneezed at. They're Egyptian. Or at least Egyptianish. Summer says she has deliberately taken these up a notch so that there's something to work towards and I think that's a good idea. This isn't a thing you can rush, so building up turn skills slowly and carefully is quite appropriate. Each combo takes up two or more turns and is ""music free"" in the sense that you can use them as-is anywhere else. The main practice will come from these combinations. Each combo has a music-only extended practice session. I'll bring up a favorite grouse of mine - these should be gently cued. There no need to call out the break down, but just some minimal cues would be good. That's because while you're dancing along, you cannot possibly look at the video - you'll be busy doing your footwork, turning away, and hopefully spotting real good etc. But all said and done, these combinations are impressive. And there are so many of them they could keep someone like me busy for a year. You can practice the combinations in an extended practice session separately as well.This video ends with three performances from Summer. One of them actually involves a Secrets of the Stage style commentary where Summer tells you about the challenges of dancing and turning in restaurants. I am horrified to learn that a false hair piece once flew right off during a turn. Good thing it landed on the floor and not in someone's plate.On this DVD, you will not find the basics of belly dance moves explained. Thank god for that. There are enough DVDs for that. In any case, if you're ready to tackle turns, you're probably not a complete beginner. I'd recommend this video for those who know the very basics. It will also be helpful for those who are taking classes and need specific help with turns.Overall, I would have rated this a 5 for being unique and Thisdoing a good job of bridging two (or indeed three) genres of dance) and for covering so many turns. The sheer number of wonderful combinations too deserves a 5. But I will take off one point because breakdown for each turn should have been deeper, there should have been more safety tips, a mini practice or try out with the turn explanation, and slight cuing during the extended practice. Whatever points it gets, it's a useful part of a dancer's toolkit.",4,Thank god someone's teaching turns!

1388093,AVPM4HFPBHGFK,B004763HN0,Deborah P,"[7, 7]","The other reviews cover this video beautifully. I just want to add another review so that people know how worthwhile this video is.If you've been dancing for a while--on a learning curve--then you KNOW that spending time on your turns is SO VERY necessary. I am an intermediate dancer, have been for a while but I've been stumbling through the turns...when I got a choreography down pretty well I'd stumble through it faster maybe a tiny bit more smoothly.The simple instructions about how to tuck this and that to center my weight stopped me from falling over almost instantly. Learning where to place my feet and how to power the turn or use my arms to get my momentum going took care of the rest. I can't believe nobody has done this kind of DVD before---and that the most advanced classes and videos just skip over this part.I'm still not through the whole video after having had it for 3 months because it's too boring in spots--and that's why I took one star off. The practice isn't very stimulating somehow. And she DOES NOT CUE well (as in not at all in places). I SERIOUSLY had to use the repeat function on the DVD player--there's not nearly enough repetition during the teaching segment. But on the content, she's ACES!",4,This took me from intermediate to advanced intermediate in about 20 minutes,1301616000,"04 1, 2011",2011,1230,"['other', 'reviews', 'cover', 'video', 'beautifully', 'just', 'want', 'add', 'review', 'people', 'know', 'how', 'worthwhile', 'video', 'is.If', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dancing', 'while', 'learning', 'curve', 'then', 'KNOW', 'spending', 'time', 'turns', 'SO', 'VERY', 'necessary', 'am', 'intermediate', 'dancer', 'have', 'been', 'while', ""'ve"", 'been', 'stumbling', 'turns', 'when', 'got', 'choreography', 'down', 'pretty', 'well', ""'d"", 'stumble', 'faster', 'maybe', 'tiny', 'bit', 'more', 'smoothly.The', 'simple', 'instructions', 'how', 'tuck', 'center', 'weight', 'stopped', 'falling', 'over', 'almost', 'instantly', 'Learning', 'where', 'place', 'feet', 'how', 'power', 'turn', 'use', 'arms', 'get', 'momentum', 'going', 'took', 'care', 'rest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'nobody', 'done', 'kind', 'DVD', '-and', 'most', 'advanced', 'classes', 'videos', 'just', 'skip', 'part.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'whole', 'video', 'having', 'had', '3', 'months', 'too', 'boring', 'spots', 'why', 'took', 'one', 'star', 'practice', ""n't"", 'very', 'stimulating', 'somehow', 'NOT', 'CUE', 'well', 'not', 'places', 'SERIOUSLY', 'had', 'use', 'repeat', 'function', 'DVD', 'player', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'repetition', 'teaching', 'segment', 'content', 'ACES']",N/A

I have watched a lot of people do a compass spin, but I never knew how to do it myself...and i've tried. This teacher breaks down correct technique and body posture that will allow dancers to get their spins looking beautiful, controlled, and balanced. She introduces you to a wide variety of spins and then helps build muscle memory with some combinations. Using the concepts delivered in the combination section, a dancer can make her own combinations that switch between flow, dance vocabulary, and spins. This teacher demonstrates her strategy and transitions so that dancers can use their own style of dance to accomplish beautiful spins, grace with transitions, and understanding how these tools fit together to use in a future choreography or inprovisational dance.",5,Very Nice,1344902400,"08 14, 2012",2012,916,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'material', 'presented', 'video', 'People', 'classical', 'dance', 'training', 'will', 'benefit', 'information', 'provided', 'here', 'have', 'watched', 'lot', 'people', 'do', 'compass', 'spin', 'never', 'knew', 'how', 'do', 'i', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'teacher', 'down', 'correct', 'technique', 'body', 'posture', 'will', 'allow', 'dancers', 'get', 'spins', 'looking', 'beautiful', 'controlled', 'balanced', 'wide', 'variety', 'spins', 'then', 'build', 'muscle', 'memory', 'combinations', 'Using', 'concepts', 'delivered', 'combination', 'section', 'dancer', 'can', 'make', 'own', 'combinations', 'switch', 'flow', 'dance', 'vocabulary', 'spins', 'teacher', 'strategy', 'transitions', 'so', 'dancers', 'can', 'use', 'own', 'style', 'dance', 'accomplish', 'beautiful', 'spins', 'grace', 'transitions', 'understanding', 'how', 'tools', 'fit', 'together', 'use', 'future', 'choreography', 'inprovisational', 'dance']",N/A

1388096,A2OG83SEU9HL6D,B004763HN0,"Shannon B Davis ""Nepenthe""","[21, 21]","This DVD covers more turns (mostly turns, not too many spins) than any other DVD I've seen.  It has a strong basis in ballet and jazz, and most of these turns will be news to the average belly dancer.  My turn repertoire was basically barrel, 3-point, chaine, and plant and unwind.  Having seen this DVD, I now know that there are so many more.  At the same time, I questioned whether some of these would be useful in the style of bellydance I do.  For example, attitude turns would not be attractive in the costumes I wear - they are more suitable for the pants-costumes I often see Summer Sahar wear.I appreciated the technique and strengthening.  It was inspiring, first of all, and I am now doing plie and releve drills.  I got the message about how to improve your turn technique and will definitely be mulling it over and integrating it.The next part went through all teh turns in quick succession.  Very quick.  Each turn had perhaps a couple of opportunities to practice.  When it got to the more unfamiliar turns such as Soutenu, Star, Attitude - the explanation and movement went by so fast, that it was impossible for me to catch the nuances, let alone follow along.  Turning has always been hard for me to learn for the simple fact that you turn away as you do it.  I must learn by doing, not by watching, so I cannot simply watch an instructor execute a move and then repeat it.  So, I found the instruction lacking.  Now, I would take a live workshop with Summer Sahar on turns, because I think in that situation, she would take more time, give feedback, and it would be easier to absorb because you could see her body in the full three dimensions.  On television, it was all too quick.  Granted, I could rewind and replay, but historically that is not something I like to do with dance dvds (you can't hold the remote while you dance).  One of the challenges was understanding the poses she would come to after completing a turn.  The turn itself was often explained, but the ending pose was not.  Attitude was shown, but not explained - I am sure it is more complex than an arabesque with a bent leg - especially since to me an Arabesque is very different - since I have a Middle Eastern dance background and no Western dance experience at all.So, I will not say that this is a bad DVD, because it is not.  But it goes very fast, with little practice or repetition, so it is neither good for beginners, nor does it give enough guidance for dancers who have not had a ballet or jazz background.  So, it is not something that I want in my library right now.  I need to work on this topic very badly, but it is as if I was just learning to use a computer, and I picked up a Linux tome, and I was trying to learn command-line when I didn't even know how to click the Start button.  It's like that - too much required knowledge that I don't have.  It should have come with a prerequisite label!I disagree with the reviewer that the combinations are Egyptian-ish.  The combinations didn't strike me as Egyptian at all - more like jazz fusion.  However, my understanding is that the combinations are meant to showcase the turns, which themselves are jazz or ballet based, in the main.In many ways, this DVD reminded me of Ballet for Bellydancers, in that it is taking a topic coming from outside bellydance, and showing how to use it to enhance your bellydancing.  However, I thought Ballet for Bellydancers was a better DVD for me because it had more repetition and practice.",3,very geared towards jazz and ballet - difficult to follow without previous experience,1293062400,"12 23, 2010",2010,3485,"['DVD', 'more', 'turns', 'mostly', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'spins', 'other', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'strong', 'basis', 'ballet', 'jazz', 'most', 'turns', 'will', 'be', 'news', 'average', 'belly', 'dancer', 'turn', 'repertoire', 'was', 'basically', 'barrel', '3-point', 'chaine', 'plant', 'unwind', 'Having', 'seen', 'DVD', 'now', 'know', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'same', 'time', 'questioned', 'would', 'be', 'useful', 'style', 'bellydance', 'do', 'example', 'attitude', 'turns', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'attractive', 'costumes', 'wear', 'are', 'more', 'suitable', 'pants-costumes', 'often', 'see', 'Summer', 'Sahar', 'wear.I', 'appreciated', 'technique', 'strengthening', 'was', 'inspiring', 'first', 'am', 'now', 'doing', 'plie', 'releve', 'drills', 'got', 'message', 'how', 'improve', 'turn', 'technique', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'mulling', 'integrating', 'it.The', 'next', 'part', 'went', 'teh', 'quick', 'succession', 'Very', 'quick', 'turn', 'had', 'perhaps', 'couple', 'opportunities', 'practice', 'When', 'got', 'more', 'unfamiliar', 'turns', 'such', 'Soutenu', 'Star', 'Attitude', 'explanation', 'movement', 'went', 'fast', 'was', 'impossible', 'catch', 'nuances', 'let', 'alone', 'follow', 'along', 'Turning', 'always', 'been', 'hard', 'learn', 'simple', 'fact', 'turn', 'away', 'do', 'must', 'learn', 'doing', 'not', 'watching', 'can', 'not', 'simply', 'watch', 'instructor', 'execute', 'move', 'then', 'repeat', 'So', 'found', 'instruction', 'lacking', 'Now', 'would', 'take', 'live', 'workshop', 'Summer', 'Sahar', 'turns', 'think', 'situation', 'would', 'take', 'more', 'time', 'give', 'feedback', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'absorb', 'could', 'see', 'body', 'full', 'three', 'dimensions', 'television', 'was', 'too', 'quick', 'Granted', 'could', 'rewind', 'replay', 'historically', 'not', 'something', 'like', 'do', 'dance', 'dvds', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'remote', 'dance', 'One', 'challenges', 'was', 'understanding', 'poses', 'would', 'come', 'completing', 'turn', 'turn', 'was', 'often', 'explained', 'ending', 'pose', 'was', 'not', 'Attitude', 'was', 'shown', 'not', 'explained', 'am', 'sure', 'more', 'complex', 'arabesque', 'bent', 'leg', 'especially', 'Arabesque', 'very', 'different', 'have', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'dance', 'background', 'Western', 'dance', 'experience', 'all.So', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'bad', 'DVD', 'not', 'very', 'fast', 'little', 'practice', 'repetition', 'neither', 'good', 'beginners', 'give', 'enough', 'guidance', 'dancers', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'ballet', 'jazz', 'background', 'So', 'not', 'something', 'want', 'library', 'right', 'now', 'need', 'work', 'topic', 'very', 'badly', 'was', 'just', 'learning', 'use', 'computer', 'picked', 'up', 'Linux', 'tome', 'was', 'trying', 'learn', 'command-line', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'click', 'Start', 'button', 'too', 'much', 'required', 'knowledge', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'should', 'have', 'come', 'prerequisite', 'label', 'disagree', 'reviewer', 'combinations', 'are', 'Egyptian-ish', 'combinations', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'Egyptian', 'more', 'jazz', 'fusion', 'However', 'understanding', 'combinations', 'are', 'meant', 'showcase', 'turns', 'are', 'jazz', 'ballet', 'based', 'main.In', 'many', 'ways', 'DVD', 'reminded', 'Ballet', 'Bellydancers', 'taking', 'topic', 'coming', 'outside', 'bellydance', 'showing', 'how', 'use', 'enhance', 'bellydancing', 'However', 'thought', 'Ballet', 'Bellydancers', 'was', 'better', 'DVD', 'had', 'more', 'repetition', 'practice']",N/A
