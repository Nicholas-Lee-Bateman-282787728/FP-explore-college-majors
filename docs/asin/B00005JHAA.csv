583779,A2H1DWEYO980JV,B00005JHAA,Andrew Masters,"[7, 9]","Hidden in silence delves into an aspect of the Holocaust that is not often known or taught about. Catholics have had some bad press in recent years as more of their darker actions towards the Jews during WW2 have come to light, some of it deservedly so, but this movie transcends that and declares to all that the best of what humanity can do, can and does manifest itself, even in the midst of the baser of human depravity. I enjoyed this movie, I have an avid interest in most things relating to military history, especially WW1 & WW2, and this movie comes from a more 'quirckier' aspect of WW2. The acting is good (though not excellent) and more over tells the viewer a story than one that draws the viewer into it. If the viewer is interested in history, military history, human interaction in the most direst of circumstances and of heroism, heroism not of the sporting variety, but true heroism where someone is willing to sacrifice their lives for others who do not share in their philosophy, then this movie is for you. It is one of hope eternal, of crushing fear and of heroism of the highest order in the midst of and along with the shameable actions of a depraved society. The movie is somewhat dated now but setting that aside it is a movie most enjoyable to watch and a topic which will be discussed for days thereafter. Very thought provoking and such that I am glad that I did not live in those times as portrayed in the movie. I'd give it a 6.5 - 7.5 out of 10.",4,Not just another Holocaust movie,1299196800,"03 4, 2011",2011,1477,"['Hidden', 'silence', 'delves', 'aspect', 'Holocaust', 'not', 'often', 'known', 'taught', 'Catholics', 'have', 'had', 'bad', 'press', 'recent', 'years', 'more', 'darker', 'actions', 'towards', 'Jews', 'WW2', 'have', 'come', 'light', 'deservedly', 'so', 'movie', 'best', 'what', 'humanity', 'can', 'do', 'can', 'manifest', 'even', 'midst', 'baser', 'human', 'depravity', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'have', 'avid', 'interest', 'most', 'things', 'relating', 'military', 'history', 'especially', 'WW1', 'WW2', 'movie', 'more', ""'quirckier"", 'aspect', 'WW2', 'acting', 'good', 'not', 'excellent', 'more', 'viewer', 'story', 'one', 'viewer', 'viewer', 'interested', 'history', 'military', 'history', 'human', 'interaction', 'most', 'direst', 'circumstances', 'heroism', 'heroism', 'not', 'sporting', 'variety', 'true', 'heroism', 'where', 'someone', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'lives', 'others', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'share', 'philosophy', 'then', 'movie', 'one', 'hope', 'eternal', 'crushing', 'fear', 'heroism', 'highest', 'order', 'midst', 'shameable', 'actions', 'depraved', 'society', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'now', 'setting', 'movie', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'topic', 'will', 'be', 'discussed', 'days', 'thereafter', 'Very', 'thought', 'provoking', 'such', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'times', 'portrayed', 'movie', ""'d"", 'give', '6.5', '7.5', '10']",Hidden In Silence - Based on a True Story VHS

583783,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,B00005JHAA,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[6, 7]","Stefania Podgorska`s story of how she singlehandedly saved Polish Jews during the Holocaust is a miraculous one.  The film,`Hidden Silence,` attempts to translate this inspiring tale of selfless courage to the screen.  Despite its clumsy and amateur finish, the film serves up a compelling historical drama.Kellie Martin, who plays Podgorska, known by the nickname, `Fusia,`saves the film from its various failings.  In fact, without her impassioned performance, the film would be a dead fish.  The Gentile shopkeeper of a Jewish-owned cafe in pre-WWII Przemysl, Poland, Fusia is the bright star in a very dark night.  Her sparkling eyes and fetching smile seem to immediately disarm the Soviet soldiers occupying Przemysl.  When Barbarossa is unleashed and the Nazis surge into Soviet-controlled Poland, Fusia`s employees and second family are confined to the ghetto.  Left in charge of their store and flat, the twenty-something Fusia grows up overnight.  She spends her days smuggling food into the ghetto and smuggling people out.  Gradually, she manages to free 13 people in all, most of them members of her employer`s family.  As the Final Solution gathers momentum, Fusia moves her charges out of the dangerous city and into a rural house. Her days are fraught with fear and fatigue as she evades the Gestapo and struggles to keep her charges fed.  With her job at a nearby factory, Fusia makes enough money to keep her sacred mission going.  Her little sister helps distract nosy neighbors and disarm the suspicions of the Gestapo.Shot in the Czech Republic during the halcyon days of the early 1990`s, the production suffers from a conspicuous amateur sheen.  The idyllic Czech background is a poor substitute for the grim despair of wartime Poland.  Moreover, the extras appear to be Czech army draftees whose command of English is lacking.  In fact, had these extras been allowed to converse in their native Czech, the film`s authenticity would have been greatly improved.  Instead, the dialogue is often broken and false.  Even top-notch Czech actors like Anna Geislerova and Jan Nemejovsky are crippled by their forced English.  A subtitled film would have worked much better here.Moreover, its linguistic roughness aside, the script itself seems to inhibit the characters.  The escapees are never allowed to blossom into full characters.  It is as if the actors themselves are compressed and limited by their awful confinement and as a result, remain flat and uninspired ghosts.  Only Kellie Martin breathes life into her character.  She captures Podgorska`s simple faith and passionate sense of mission.  `These people did nothing wrong!` is her guiding mantra.  Unfortunately, the other performances fall short and remain forgettable.The defects notwithstanding, `Hidden Silence` somehow grabs the viewer.  I almost stopped watching after the first five minutes but somehow such a compelling story of heroism begs to be witnessed in full.  To its credit, the film hurries along at a swift pace so you never have time to fully react to its shortcomings.  Instead, you end up caring about the waif-like Fusia who risked so much to save a few from the Nazi murder machine.Stefania Podgorska`s story is one of many.  Nameless thousands risked their lives and those of their families to rescue their fellow Poles--Jew and Christian-- from certain death at the hands of the Nazis.  This is reason enough to watch this film.  Not only a fitting homage to Podgorska and the other `righteous ones` who saved their neighbors, `Hidden Silence` is an inspiring tale of hope and courage.  Despite its flaws, it`s still worth watching.",4,Flawed but worth watching.,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,3637,"['Stefania', 'Podgorska', 's', 'story', 'how', 'singlehandedly', 'saved', 'Polish', 'Jews', 'Holocaust', 'miraculous', 'one', 'film', 'Hidden', 'Silence', 'attempts', 'translate', 'inspiring', 'tale', 'selfless', 'courage', 'screen', 'clumsy', 'amateur', 'finish', 'film', 'up', 'compelling', 'historical', 'drama.Kellie', 'Martin', 'who', 'Podgorska', 'known', 'nickname', 'Fusia', 'film', 'various', 'failings', 'fact', 'impassioned', 'performance', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'dead', 'fish', 'Gentile', 'shopkeeper', 'Jewish-owned', 'cafe', 'pre-WWII', 'Przemysl', 'Poland', 'Fusia', 'bright', 'star', 'very', 'dark', 'night', 'sparkling', 'eyes', 'fetching', 'smile', 'seem', 'immediately', 'disarm', 'Soviet', 'soldiers', 'occupying', 'Przemysl', 'When', 'Barbarossa', 'unleashed', 'Nazis', 'surge', 'Soviet-controlled', 'Poland', 'Fusia', 's', 'employees', 'second', 'family', 'are', 'confined', 'ghetto', 'Left', 'charge', 'store', 'flat', 'twenty-something', 'Fusia', 'up', 'overnight', 'days', 'smuggling', 'food', 'ghetto', 'smuggling', 'people', 'out', 'Gradually', 'free', '13', 'people', 'most', 'members', 'employer', 's', 'family', 'Final', 'Solution', 'gathers', 'momentum', 'Fusia', 'charges', 'dangerous', 'city', 'rural', 'house', 'days', 'are', 'fraught', 'fear', 'fatigue', 'Gestapo', 'keep', 'charges', 'fed', 'job', 'nearby', 'factory', 'Fusia', 'enough', 'money', 'keep', 'sacred', 'mission', 'going', 'little', 'sister', 'distract', 'nosy', 'neighbors', 'disarm', 'suspicions', 'Gestapo.Shot', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'halcyon', 'days', 'early', '1990', 's', 'production', 'suffers', 'conspicuous', 'amateur', 'sheen', 'idyllic', 'Czech', 'background', 'poor', 'substitute', 'grim', 'despair', 'wartime', 'Poland', 'Moreover', 'extras', 'appear', 'be', 'Czech', 'army', 'draftees', 'command', 'English', 'lacking', 'fact', 'had', 'extras', 'been', 'allowed', 'converse', 'native', 'Czech', 'film', 's', 'authenticity', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'greatly', 'improved', 'Instead', 'dialogue', 'often', 'broken', 'false', 'Even', 'top-notch', 'Czech', 'actors', 'Anna', 'Geislerova', 'Jan', 'Nemejovsky', 'are', 'crippled', 'forced', 'English', 'A', 'subtitled', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'much', 'better', 'here.Moreover', 'linguistic', 'roughness', 'aside', 'script', 'inhibit', 'characters', 'escapees', 'are', 'never', 'allowed', 'blossom', 'full', 'characters', 'actors', 'are', 'compressed', 'limited', 'awful', 'confinement', 'result', 'remain', 'flat', 'uninspired', 'ghosts', 'Only', 'Kellie', 'Martin', 'life', 'character', 'Podgorska', 's', 'simple', 'faith', 'passionate', 'sense', 'mission', 'people', 'did', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'guiding', 'mantra', 'Unfortunately', 'other', 'performances', 'fall', 'short', 'remain', 'forgettable.The', 'defects', 'notwithstanding', 'Hidden', 'Silence', 'somehow', 'grabs', 'viewer', 'almost', 'stopped', 'watching', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'somehow', 'compelling', 'story', 'heroism', 'begs', 'be', 'witnessed', 'full', 'credit', 'film', 'hurries', 'along', 'swift', 'pace', 'never', 'have', 'time', 'fully', 'react', 'shortcomings', 'Instead', 'end', 'up', 'caring', 'waif-like', 'Fusia', 'who', 'risked', 'so', 'much', 'save', 'few', 'Nazi', 'murder', 'machine.Stefania', 'Podgorska', 's', 'story', 'one', 'many', 'Nameless', 'thousands', 'risked', 'lives', 'families', 'rescue', 'fellow', 'Poles', 'Jew', 'Christian', 'certain', 'death', 'hands', 'Nazis', 'reason', 'enough', 'watch', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'fitting', 'homage', 'Podgorska', 'other', 'righteous', 'ones', 'who', 'saved', 'neighbors', 'Hidden', 'Silence', 'inspiring', 'tale', 'hope', 'courage', 'flaws', 's', 'still', 'worth', 'watching']",Hidden In Silence - Based on a True Story VHS

First come the Russians, then the Germans, and finally the Russians again. Based on a true story, a teenaged Polish girl rescues many Jews by hiding them in a large house.It is obvious that professionals did not make this film, and that it was not made by Hollywood. Granted that some of the visual effects are primitive, and that there are misconceptions about the war and occupation. What it lacks in Hollywood pyrotechnics, and other shortcomings, it more than makes up in content. It is a moving story of death-defying heroism, as well as the power of faith and prayer.Poland in conquered in 1939, and Russians rule Przemysl. Nazi Germany attacks its erstwhile Soviet ally, and rules over Przemysl from mid-1941 to mid-1944. The teenage Polish girl ""Fusia"" (not the real name of the actual Polish girl who engaged in these heroics) loses her parents, who are deported to Nazi Germany for forced labor. She must care for herself and her little sister. Soon she will be caring for far more.The Germans humiliate the Jews, destroy their shops, and shoot some of them. Soon they will do far more. They lock up the Jews in a ghetto. Fusia defies the law by smuggling food into the ghetto. Then the Germans start shipping the Jews out to ""labor camps"". Some of the Jews figure exactly what the Germans actually have in mind, and beg to stay with Fusia. One of them shows up, all bloody, and tells of how he had jumped out of the train. She accepts more and more fugitive Jews in her house.The situation in which the young Fusia has to deal with is onerous. She gets a job, whose boss is a Volksdeutsche, in order to earn enough money to feed the fugitive Jews. She cannot allow a guy interested in her to walk her home, or have any semblance of a normal life otherwise. Neighbors notice more and more people going to her home. Someone comments that the food that her little sister is carrying home is ""quite a lot for two sisters."" However, no one denounces her.During the German occupation of Poland, some Jews actually gave up, left their hiding places, and turned themselves over to the Germans--causing not only their deaths but also the deaths of other hidden Jews and their Polish benefactors. Fusia has to deal with a hysterical woman who ran out of the hiding place, and wanted to do the same.For quite a while, things seem to be working out. There are the usual frictions between confined people, and Fusia is outraged by the conduct of some of the Jews--conduct which can easily lead to the German discovery of the hiding place, and certain death to Fusia, her sister, and all the Jews. Then, very unexpectedly, the Germans want to requisition the big house for themselves, and want it almost immediately.

Kellie Marin does a fine job of portraying the teenage girl who must raise her little sister on her own,plus take in 13 Jews which she manages to hide in her attic. The acting and writing are superb. I have one complaint though, I hated the lighting in the film...it was so dark and it made the quality look cheap, like a low budget film. Other that that, it is good and I appreciated the producers not allowing a ton of violence to be shown. It is not necessary; Hearing about the war was ugly enough. Since Schindlers' List isn't exactly appropraite for young children, this one makes a nice alternative. (They won't have nightmares for months later.)P.S.
