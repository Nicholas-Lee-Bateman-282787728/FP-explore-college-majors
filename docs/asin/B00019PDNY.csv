797114,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00019PDNY,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[3, 5]","Showtime's documentary, Penn and Teller: Bulls***, has it all (except objectivity).  It's got comedy, idiots, swindlers, magic tricks, and plenty of hidden camera ""experiments"".  Las Vegas stars Penn Jillette and his silent partner Teller, self-proclaimed truthsmiths, attack certain parts of culture that they believe (and usully correctly) to be a hoax.  Some of their targets are obvious (talking to the dead, alien abductions, ESP), while some of the other things they go after require a little more convincing from them (second-hand smoke).This is not an objective show, and Penn and Teller do not delude themselves or their audience into thinking that it is.  In fact, they even claim that, when lining up guests for episodes, they always tell everyone which side of the issue they will be arguing in favor of.  Despite that, they always seem to find representitives from the other side of the argument who are very willing to make their point.  However, P&T;, along with the guests on their side, always find ways to blow very large holes into the opposition's arguments.There are two kinds of BS that they go after; one in which the institution itself is attacked (most of the paranormal episodes), while the other kind is when the go after the exploitation of the institution (such as in the Sex, Sex, Sex episode; sex itself isn't BS, but they it is marketed is).  Both of these methods are interesting in their own way, and our hosts almost always seem to find humor in the people that they are going after.  However, every once in a while, a BSer comes along who does something so atrocious in their minds that Penn goes very serious and points out how they are hurting others.  The example that I can think of in this season invovles the Talking to the Dead episode; these mediums who take money from grieving people so that they can ""communicate"" with recently deceased loved ones is terrible.  Also, in the Alternative Medicine episode, I think there are a few people who are in desperate need of actual medicine, but don't get it because they buy into alternative medicine (the best example overall doesn't come until season 3 in the Signs From Heaven episode).  Also, while P&T; often make fun of the people who buy into the myths that they debunk, that isn't always the case.  In the Baby episode, Penn states that parents are the ones being taken advantage of, but it isn't the parents' faults, because they only want the best for their kids.While all of the episodes are good, I have to make special mention of the Alien Abduction, Sex, Sex, Sex, and Creationism episodes.  Those were probably my favorite ones this season.  They are all very funny, informative, and, in a sense, a bit sad.  It is very weird what some people will do to believe in something very blindly (Creationism) or do in order to sell something (Aliens/Sex).Penn and Teller are definitely not for everyone.  This show is very edgy, and since it is on Showtime, they can get away with heavy profanity and nudity.  Also, it is very offensive, and it will drive away many people.  I would be lying if I said that I have never been offended by some of the things that they've done/said, but I really don't mind.  This is a great show.",5,Bulls*** Never Smelled So Good,1123200000,"08 5, 2005",2005,3223,"['Showtime', 'documentary', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'Bulls***', 'objectivity', 'got', 'comedy', 'idiots', 'swindlers', 'magic', 'tricks', 'plenty', 'hidden', 'camera', 'experiments', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Penn', 'Jillette', 'silent', 'partner', 'Teller', 'self-proclaimed', 'truthsmiths', 'attack', 'certain', 'parts', 'culture', 'believe', 'usully', 'correctly', 'be', 'hoax', 'targets', 'are', 'obvious', 'talking', 'dead', 'alien', 'abductions', 'ESP', 'other', 'things', 'go', 'require', 'little', 'more', 'convincing', 'second-hand', 'smoke', '.This', 'not', 'objective', 'show', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'do', 'not', 'delude', 'audience', 'thinking', 'fact', 'even', 'claim', 'when', 'lining', 'up', 'guests', 'episodes', 'always', 'tell', 'everyone', 'side', 'issue', 'will', 'be', 'arguing', 'favor', 'always', 'seem', 'find', 'representitives', 'other', 'side', 'argument', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'willing', 'make', 'point', 'However', 'P', 'T', 'guests', 'side', 'always', 'find', 'ways', 'blow', 'very', 'large', 'holes', 'opposition', 'are', 'two', 'kinds', 'BS', 'go', 'one', 'institution', 'attacked', 'most', 'paranormal', 'episodes', 'other', 'kind', 'when', 'go', 'exploitation', 'institution', 'such', 'Sex', 'Sex', 'Sex', 'episode', 'sex', ""n't"", 'BS', 'marketed', 'methods', 'are', 'interesting', 'own', 'way', 'hosts', 'almost', 'always', 'seem', 'find', 'humor', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'However', 'once', 'while', 'BSer', 'along', 'who', 'something', 'so', 'atrocious', 'minds', 'Penn', 'very', 'serious', 'points', 'out', 'how', 'are', 'hurting', 'others', 'example', 'can', 'think', 'season', 'Talking', 'Dead', 'episode', 'mediums', 'who', 'take', 'money', 'grieving', 'people', 'so', 'can', 'communicate', 'recently', 'deceased', 'loved', 'ones', 'terrible', 'Also', 'Alternative', 'Medicine', 'episode', 'think', 'are', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'desperate', 'need', 'actual', 'medicine', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'buy', 'alternative', 'medicine', 'best', 'example', 'overall', ""n't"", 'come', 'season', '3', 'Signs', 'From', 'Heaven', 'episode', 'Also', 'P', 'T', 'often', 'make', 'fun', 'people', 'who', 'buy', 'myths', 'debunk', ""n't"", 'always', 'case', 'Baby', 'episode', 'Penn', 'parents', 'are', 'ones', 'being', 'taken', 'advantage', ""n't"", 'parents', 'faults', 'only', 'want', 'best', 'kids.While', 'episodes', 'are', 'good', 'have', 'make', 'special', 'mention', 'Alien', 'Abduction', 'Sex', 'Sex', 'Sex', 'Creationism', 'episodes', 'were', 'probably', 'favorite', 'ones', 'season', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'informative', 'sense', 'bit', 'sad', 'very', 'weird', 'what', 'people', 'will', 'do', 'believe', 'something', 'very', 'blindly', 'Creationism', 'do', 'order', 'sell', 'something', 'Aliens/Sex', '.Penn', 'Teller', 'are', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'show', 'very', 'edgy', 'Showtime', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'heavy', 'profanity', 'nudity', 'Also', 'very', 'offensive', 'will', 'drive', 'away', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'lying', 'said', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'offended', 'things', ""'ve"", 'done/said', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'great', 'show']",Penn & Teller - Bullsh*t! - The First Season

This is fine when it comes to issues that are obviously untrue and especially when the people they are excoriating are making a living off other people's suffering. However, when they tackle a serious issue such as second hand smoke this is a liability. The American Cancer Society has spoken out against second hand smoke which has resulted in many municipalities and even countries cracking down on indoor smoking, and this is a well regarded organization which basis its studies on facts.  They are also skating on thin ice when it comes to global warming. Yes some members of Green Peace are out of date hippies but that does not negate what is happenning. Penn and Teller conclude that though the earth is warming up, there is no proof that people are behind it. They then vaguely say that if people want to know more ""studies"" should be done. This is the exact stance of the Republicans, thus proving that except on first amendment issues, libertarians are Republicans in drag. They then attack PETA which is okay by me but saying in a blow harded voice, ""I would rather that all the monkeys in the world die than a single human"". I don't know about that. I could live just fine without cigarette smokers but I would miss the monkeys. Anyway, if you want facts try your local public television station.

They don't touch types of alternative medicine that have research to back them up (acupuncture, etc.) even when Western science can't explain them (that would make Western science look bad - and they can't have that. They go after creationists and find the loopiest, least intelligent, least articulate representatives for creationism and/or intelligent design while ignoring the over 60% of scientists who believe in God (and over 70% of M.D.s who believe in God) and who believe that there is more to the universe than atheistic materialism. Nope, they can't do that as their show would fall apart if all scientists weren't portrayed as intelligent, rational skeptics and all theists weren't portrayed as wackos. I guess P&T only consider scientists to be rational if they agree with P&T??  P&T show that male enlargement techniques don't work (They don't)- but then use that show as a soapbox to preach their own philosophy of sexual hedonism - which is Bull**** because one has nothing whatsoever to do with the other and this was supposed to be a show about rational debunking, not the playboy philosophy according to P&T. A lot of naked people stroll around the set exploitatively while P&T  preach away in the foreground, hardly a scientific method to deal with philosophical questions (more Bull***).

Penn and Teller always pick interesting topics and they consisently have a well-rounded presentation for each show. Penn's comments are usually funny and each episode is an invitation for thought, debate, and careful consideration.My only gripe, really, is that sometimes Penn's rants run a bit too long.  He's funny and what you see is clearly the result of a skeptic trying to survive in a world full of chiropracters and feng shui, but it feels like the show would be better served by more debate and interviews.  Of course, this is a minor complaint---a better gripe would be that the show is only 30 minutes long.  Each topic could easily pad out to at least a 60 minute show, if not a full-fledged documentary.In my previous review of this season, I mentioned that I was annoyed that P & T use Bjorn Lomborg as a reference in their Environmental Hysteria. (And for that reason I deducted a star from the rating.  I'd like to change that, but all I seem to be able to edit is my review itself.)  I've since then changed my opinion on this---having learned more about Lomborg's work over the last year and half, and having learned more about the criticism aimed toward him, I feel that there was no reason he should not have been featured on the episode.  ""Environmental Hysteria"" is an excellent episode---surprisingly, Penn is much calmer in this episode than in any other!I also highly recommend the episodes on bottled water, second-hand smoke, and creationism.

They start off on any subject with an opinion in mind, then search for and massage evidence to support that conclusion.  The most egregious example of this, to me, is their show on AA--they pick a loud and articulate woman to support their view and then a meek and nervous guy to speak for the opposition.  That kind of cherry-picking is typical, like when they use outtakes of an environmentalist stumbling over her words to make her seem poorly informed and overly emotional, then cut to a slick guy at the CATO institute without explaining its right-wing nature or corporate funding (they call it ""libertarian"").  Even when I agree with them, such as in the case of the Creationism episode, I find myself annoyed at how they load their debate in favor of their pre-arrived conclusions.Maybe it's obvious that a couple of TV magicians are in no position to argue anything--but they are superior showmen and they know how to convince their audience regardless of how stupid and shallow their arguments are.  And being on tv itself gives them the imprimatur of authority.

Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell can talk about religion on their TV shows and entertain people. Now, Penn and Teller can call all of the above ""Bullsh.t"" and entertain people - skeptical people like me (and I'm assuming) you.The concept of the show is to take a sacred cow - environmental hysteria, ESP, creationism, alternative medicine - and devote a show to not only trying to debunk it, but have a good laugh at it in the process. Many beliefs will be shredded, many feelings will be hurt, and many people WILL be offended. But, in the process, the show will make us think about why people believe such seemingly far-out things, and why they (or you) shouldn't.I must say, though, that anyone looking for rigorous debunkings will not quite get it here. First, each show is about thirty minutes in length, so the time constraints alone prevent any really detailed factual debunking. Secondly, Penn and Teller are entertainers and, as such, their first goal is to keep you interested. The best way to lose an audience, though, is to lecture them with lengthy factual diatribes.So, all in all, I agree with some other reviewers that one must be skeptical also of the skeptics. In the ""Environmental Hysteria"" episode, for instance, Penn and Teller 'expose' environentalism as a farce by... showing us many clips of the looniest environmentalists they can get their hands on. But this doesn't disprove environenmentalism's claims; it only casts doubt on some of the players. Other episodes do similar things: they take a belief, show that there are some very strange people who believe in it, and conclude, from that, that it is bunk - ""Bullsh.t.""I am not going to take but one star off for this, as one looking for a THOROUGH debunking of the highlighted ideas need not look far to find them. (How many times has creationism or ESP been refuted? Too many to count!) As un-PC as it is to say, what we get with this show is a pure, unbridled entertainment for the skeptic - a chance to kick back and laugh at loony people with loony ideas.

The episodes, which are narrated by Penn (since Teller doesn't talk), interject Penn's wicked dialogue (which is often profane, but that's OK with me) with interviews with people who believe in the topics at issue, followed by Penn trying to humiliate those people.  I often wonder if the people are told that if they give an interview for the show they are going to be humiliated.What I like about Penn and Teller's approach is that they don't tackle political issues, like tax breaks or war in Iraq.  They basically focus on pop culture issues.  I'm not interested in some of the topics they discussed (Feng Shui being one, for example), but their delivery of the material make it watchable.One thing, this show isn't for kids, in particular the show that they do about sex, where fully nude men and women walk around them during their dialogs, but I can't believe kids would be that interested anyway.All in all, a pretty good show, but I doubt that you would want to watch an episode more than once, so I go 4 stars here.",4,A Good Skewering of Topics of Interest Today,1082332800,"04 19, 2004",2004,1388,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'am', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'biggest', 'fan', 'watching', 'couple', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'Bull', 'decided', 'rent', 'first', 'season', 'shows.There', 'are', '13', '30', 'minute', 'episodes', 'where', 'two', 'magicians', 'take', 'issues', 'such', 'ESP', 'alien', 'abductions', 'bottled', 'water', 'diet', 'fads', 'name', 'few', 'try', 'debunk', 'episodes', 'are', 'narrated', 'Penn', 'Teller', ""n't"", 'talk', 'interject', 'Penn', 'wicked', 'dialogue', 'often', 'profane', 'OK', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'believe', 'topics', 'issue', 'followed', 'Penn', 'trying', 'humiliate', 'people', 'often', 'wonder', 'people', 'are', 'told', 'give', 'interview', 'show', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'humiliated.What', 'like', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'approach', 'do', ""n't"", 'tackle', 'political', 'issues', 'tax', 'breaks', 'war', 'Iraq', 'basically', 'focus', 'pop', 'culture', 'issues', ""'m"", 'not', 'interested', 'topics', 'discussed', 'Feng', 'Shui', 'being', 'one', 'example', 'delivery', 'material', 'make', 'watchable.One', 'thing', 'show', ""n't"", 'kids', 'particular', 'show', 'do', 'sex', 'where', 'fully', 'nude', 'men', 'women', 'walk', 'dialogs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'kids', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'anyway.All', 'pretty', 'good', 'show', 'doubt', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'episode', 'more', 'once', 'go', '4', 'stars', 'here']",Penn & Teller - Bullsh*t! - The First Season

It did a marvelous job of not only de-bunking much of what some hold as undeniable truth, but exposing the dangers and absurdity of a &quot;group think&quot; mentality.  To that, some of these reviews were written by those who take issue with the &quot;Environmental Hysteria&quot; episode, citing Bjorn Lomborg as P&amp;T's only expert testimonial.  This is not the case, they also had representatives from the CATO institute as well as the founder of Greenpeace support P&amp;T's position that the fear and hysteria promoted by the environmentalist movement is more about political ideology and less about science.

Although the pair are avowed hedonists (with an epicurian slant), they are also hardcore teetotalers, eschewing the traditional anesthetics of alcohol, nicotine, and even caffeine in favor of, say, sex and food.  Libertarians with the same view of politics that can be found in your typical episode ofSouth Park, Penn & Teller are big fans of the pursuit of knowledge and happiness, as long as it isn't at the expense of someone else's own pursuit.  It is this attitude more than anything else that prompts their myth-busting show, and although many episodes come across as mean-spirited, that's because these fellows have little patience for exploitation and willful ignorance.This three disc set covers all thirteen episodes of the first season, where the foul-mouthed prestidigitarians expose (among other things) sham psychics, the bug-eyed culture of alien abductees, bottled water, the self-help industry, and environmentalism.  The episodes are by turns enlightening, informative, thought-provoking, and disturbing.And when these guys aren't convincing, they are at least entertaining.  Some of their targets are admittedly soft (if I promised to buy him an extra controller for his Xbox, my eight year old nephew could probably debunk Ouiji Boards in ten minutes).  Others are just excuses to perform silly and titillating ""experiments"" that are mostly about embarrassing the participants or showing off mostly-naked women (see the entire episode about sex).  Still, this IS a television show we're talking about, and not rigorous scientific explorations.  A little sensationalism isn't unwarranted.Along the same lines, there's something to be said for SOME impartiality.  Penn & Teller pretend to approach each subject with some degree of openness, but it's quite obvious that no one needs to convince these guys that they're already right.  It's not hard, when you're the one calling the shots (or, in this case, edits), to make your competitors seem like manipulative idiots, and there are numerous occasions where Penn & Teller do just that, thumbing through their arguments like a couple of stand-ups who are only pretending that they don't know the punch-line to the joke they're in the midst of telling.I don't want to harp.  After all, I like the show.  And I like Penn & Teller.  And, more than any of that, I like the spirit in which the show is filmed, the idea that people are too easily pulled by emotional strings and they need to be slapped straight every once in a while, if not with some hilarious side-commentary, then at least with some simple logical application.  Along those lines, these guys do a good job of clearly presenting their side of each argument, but I'd say they aren't as skilled at presenting the opposite side.  I empathize with their anger when they encounter fraudulent ""doctors"" and ""scientists"" who milk both the hearts and wallets of vulnerable fools, but I see a little milking going on with Penn & Teller, too.  Theirs is just a bit more subtle and not nearly as self-interested.Intelligent mockery, crude comedy, and a little explotative sleight-of-hand: these guys have been doing this stuff for years, and doing it very very well.

797140,ADTUS88NFTW23,B00019PDNY,"Melkor ""dark lord""","[34, 39]","I have mixed feelings about this series.  I really like what Penn and Teller are trying to do with this show, and I tend agree with them more than I disagree.  When someone is arguing a point that I agree with, I have a tendency to be even more critical of their arguments; so, I am very critical of any weak arguments that they may make.  Regardless, we are in dire need of more skeptics in this society, so I am glad that this show exists.Michael Shermer stated in his book, ""Why People Believe Weird Things"", two fallacies of being a skeptic.  One is that when a skeptic disagrees with absolutely everything at face value, their arguments become less valuable.  The other is that skeptics are often so used to arguing against others, that they forget to closely analyze their own stance; thereby not accepting the skeptics of their skepticism.  This could lead to the false belief that any form of disagreement is correct, which Penn and Teller are occasionally guilty of in this series.  This is the mistake of using skepticism as a dogma rather than as a scientific method.Episode one is a great starter to the series.  It exposes mediums as frauds who use techniques, much like psychics do, to hot and cold read people.  The second episode on alternative medicine is one of my favorites.  They informatively use science and logic to debunk reflexology, magnet therapy, and chiropractors.  The Alien abduction episode was a little sad, because a lot of people who believed in it seemed lost, or searching for something more.  It was really sad to see how they were exploited by people trying to milk dollars out of them.The second hand smoke episode was interesting.  The episode was not so much about debunking the idea that second hand smoke is harmful.  Rather, it was about exposing the fanaticism in the anti-smoking movement, and forces non-smokers to think about the implications their movement has on civil liberties.  P&T; lost me a little here, using a radio DJ as an expert, whereas in previous episodes they had used doctors, academics, as well as reputable psychologists and scientists.  Also, they start to expose their bias.  P&T; are admitted Libertarians, and use data from the Cato institute, a free market biased libertarian think tank.  That's not to imply that the data gathered by Cato is wrong, but I hope anyone watching this show considers all of the sources, especially when political issues are involved.  Though they show that there is not current data to support the theory that second hand smoke is harmful, they don't really discuss that proper studies have not been done to prove it safe, either.  As a scientist who studies public health and statistics (there's my bias), I can tell you that such a study would be extremely complicated and expensive to design.  Still, from a civil liberties point of view, it is a very interesting episode to watch.The ""Sex"" episode exposes the lengths (no pun intended) people go to in order to improve their self esteem. As with many of these episodes, it is sad to see how people get duped out of their money. The ""Feng Shui"", ""Self-Help"", ""ESP"", ""Ouija Board"", and diet episodes were much the same. The portion of the Feng Shui episode focusing on bottled water being very informative, and P&T; give a link to the NRDC paper on their web site, which everyone should read.  The diet episode is very interesting, but I think they only presented half of the ""genetic"" foods issue.  It can be very beneficial to produce more abundant crops for third world countries.  Though, I wish they had addressed the issue that some corporation have been accused of engineering seeds that are only viable for one generation, making farmers dependent on the seed companies.The final episode, on environmentalism, was the most frustrating. Their main source against the argument of global warming is author Bjorn Lomborg, who many scientists have accused of extrapolating his conclusions from cherry picked data. Any statistician who is aware of environmental issues would know that Lomborg's data does very little to prove that global warming is wrong. Many Nobel laureates have signed an anti-global warming statement, and it is a shame that none of them could be interviewed to defend global warming. The argument they make that ""there would not be any trees, were it not be for the paper industry"" was flat out ridiculous. Unfortunately, the environmental activists deserve the treatment that they got in this episode. As I said, I am even more critical of people arguing for my own side, because I don't want my side to sound ignorant. In this episode, ill informed activists who have no idea what they are talking about are the best the environmentalists could produce to represent their side. The kind of people in college who would have drum circles and protests, without ever taking a biology or chemistry class to really understand the implications of what they are fighting about. Doing research after this show, many of the pro-environment academics have said that their interviews were dramatically edited. So, once again, a person needs to remember that this is a T.V. show that is trying to prove a point, and the creators will rarely want to look incorrect.In the introduction to his book, Michael Shermer stated that people often ask him why they should believe him. He replied, as all skeptics should, ""They shouldn't."" The controversial political analyst Noam Chomsky advises his readers to never believe anything he talks about without researching it for themselves. That advice should also be taken when watching P&T;'s show. Just because they are funny, charismatic, and sure of themselves does not mean that they are correct. To their credit, Penn and Teller post many of their sources and links for each episode on their web site. All in all, I think this is a series that everyone should watch. Especially if they watch it critically, and can remove themselves from the passionate arguments that Penn makes.",4,"A show every ""new age"" person should see.",1105401600,"01 11,

797142,A3E4P0QU692GN6,B00019PDNY,"Parker Benchley ""Edward Garea""","[17, 23]","As a fan of magicians and magic, I always rated Penn and Teller as my favorites because they explained the tricks behind the trick - usually with poor Teller as the victim of the sadistic Penn.And it is a thrill finally to get the first season of their show on DVD. I believe it's the only one like it currently running and it can only run on pay cable, what with every network buying into the various forms of Bullsh*t that permeate the American cultural scene. It is refreshing to see Penn and Teller expose such nonsense as talking with the dead, the 'dangers' of second-hand smoke, alien abductions, and the so-called positive effect of Mozart on a baby's development. And who better to debunk these phenomena than two magicians themselves, following the tradition of the Amazing Randi and Long John Nebel. In fact, Randi makes an appearance in their episode debunking Nostradamus; this episode alone is worth the price. What particulary strikes me as hilarious is the reactions of those in my audience of DVD watchers. They cheer when P &amp; T gore someone else's bull, but are quick to disagree, usually emotionally, when their own particular ox is gored.The only bad thing about this DVD is the wait I will have until next season's DVD is released.

797143,A38G64S5VMRI1P,B00019PDNY,Robert Graves,"[327, 435]","Penn and Teller's Bullshi*t is a much-needed voice of reason in the midst of the alarmist, emotionally charged know-nothings they spend their time debunking in this DVD series. What's included here is a 3-disc set that contains the entire first season (10 episodes) as well as some bonus features, most notably a bonus episode (about ghosts).Initially, I caught Bullshi*t on Showtime and fell instantly in love with it. At last, here was a series dedicated to crushing the myths that draw in millions of non-thinking individuals. There was something almost vindicating about seeing them body-slam sensationalist after sensationalist with their rhetoric, even providing thinking America with some ammunition to battle our more, well...emotion-driven friends. I had only seen three or four installments on Showtime before buying the DVD and eagerly gobbling up all ten episodes.Now that I've had some time with the series and have seen all the shows multiple times, something interesting has happened. The last episode I watched really got to me - an episode on second-hand smoke. For once, I thoroughly disagreed with Penn and Teller. The idiots that I normally found myself scoffing at - well, this time it was the hosts of the show. What I saw in that episode was Penn and Teller from the other side of the river. I saw them taking a very specific facet of an argument, thus pushing reams of data aside, and exploit it using arguments from the constitution applied to illogical extremes. Right away it started on a very shaky foot when they staged a scene of themselves in a restaurant with a noisy musician nearby, annoying them. ""You're annoying us - let's legislate against you,"" they began, implying that second-hand smoke was on the same level of loud music, nothing more than an annoyance.The most important thing to note about this argument is that there *is* legislation against loud music. It's called disturbing the peace. So apparently ""annoying"" habits are regularly legislated against, including the one they were trying to portray as absurd as an analogy.Their main thread in this argument was that since there was no direct data that linked second-hand smoke to illness, second-hand smoke is therefore okay to have around. Their sub-point is that the EPA exaggerated some data in a report they issued in the 90s, and this exaggeration has been used to fuel the legislation against smoking in public. Therefore, they seem to imply that because of the bogus data, the legislation against second-hand smoke is also bogus.To me, neither of these arguments hold any water. There is a very simple point to be made regarding second-hand smoke - we know smoking causes death and illness. The same chemicals that cause these illnesses are present in second-hand smoke. Therefore, whether or not we can prove that occasional second-hand smoke causes cancer, we do know that it contains very harmful compounds. The only difference between a non-smoker and smoker, then, is the amount of this smoke they are inhaling. Just because it's not proven that a smaller amount of smoke will cause me to die doesn't mean it's perfectly okay for it to be floating around in the air for me to breathe. If I sprayed arsenic and carbon monoxide into someone's face, they would arrest me. If I blow it into someone's face after inhaling it from a cigarette, it's legal in most areas. This is completely illogical to me. Speaking to their second point, just because the data may have been exaggerated, it doesn't mean that it's not fundamentally true.Anyway, this exposed some of the techniques that Penn and Teller use, and I started looking for them in other episodes, even those episodes with which I wholeheartedly agreed (in other words, all of them). I found something pretty standard in all their arguments. For their opponent, they usually find the absolute most extreme camp they can find, a camp that probably represents 10% of the other side of the argument, and they use that as the face of the enemy. For example, in their episode on eating and feeding the world, whom did they choose as the antagonist? Greenpeace and a group of hippie-freakshows who only eat raw foods. Of course we're going to disagree with these idiots, therefore agreeing with Penn and Teller. We leave the show thinking that any and all genetically-altered foods should be dumped into the 3rd World, bar none.What they don't show you are the extremely intelligent, forward thinking scientists who recognize the *legitimate* problems with this. Most notably, while genetic engineering may have saved a billion lives it has also done something else very obvious - drastically increased the population. Therefore, deaths related to overpopulation not associated with starvation - like aids, leprosy, and other illnesses - have drastically increased, inverse to the decrease in deaths from starvation, even exceeding it in some areas. So in trying to do good, we could, in the end, be killing more people. I'm not saying I totally agree with this point of view, just that it is a legitimate facet of the argument that isn't so easily dismissed with a wave of the hand like the ignorance of the losers that Penn and Teller put on camera. So be aware as you watch, that there are almost always more viable arguments against their points that they are not showing you. By consistently choosing only the far spectrum of their opponents, they safely avoid putting an intelligent adversary - which would probably fall somewhere in between Bullsh*t's POV and the extremist they've chosen - into the equation.This doesn't mean I won't continue to watch regularly and cheer P&T; on, or show these episodes to my more gullible friends who may be environmentalists or alternative medicine subscribers. Just understand that more often than not, there is a wide gap between what Penn and Teller are advocating and whom they choose to portray on their show, and in that gap lies a full spectrum of arguments for you to explore.",4,Skeptical about the skeptics,1090713600,"07 25, 2004",2004,5984,"['Penn', 'Teller', 'Bullshi*t', 'much-needed', 'voice', 'reason', 'midst', 'alarmist', 'emotionally',

They pick easy targets and are guilty of the same problem they accuse others of: fudging or overstating facts.  The episode on second-hand smoke is the most obvious.  The EPA findings are old and new studies show second hand smoke exposure is harmful.  Penn and Teller skew the statistics (which most over zealous skeptics do).  Of course someone who sits in a bar for 10 minutes isn't at high risk, but a waitress working there is.Other errors include genetically-modified foods: still too early to gauge long term effects not just on people, but ecologically.  They also failed to mention the overuse of milk-producing hormones in cows.  Debunking ESP also lacked the mountains of verifiable data indicating some form of ESP does actually exist.  This has been scientifically tested worldwide and is not new-age mysticism.Another problem is their ""experts"" are themselves practioners of what the same skeptics use to consider pseudo-science such as psychology and socialogy.  That's hypocritical.Otherwise, this is an entertaining show with good pacing to keep viewers interested.  Extras are watchable, but some of it may be filler.

797150,AK61LQI92GTCH,B00019PDNY,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[2, 4]","Well, folks, Penn & Teller take `em all on in this one - spiritualist, environmentalists, anti-smoking campaigners, alien abductees, and the list, it seems, gets carried on to a second season's worth of shows.I like Penn & Teller's aggressive style and willingness to take on any and all.  There's a sour delight to be had watching an episode designed to outrage intelligent designers and then later one that'll outrage Green Peacers, or those who are convinced of the harmful effects of second-hand smoke.  There sure aren't any sacred cows in this barn.I really wanted to love this series, and for the most part I did indeed like it very much.  The only problem I had, and it carried through from one episode to the next, was something mentioned in a Penn & Teller interview with Randi - their spiritual father and role model - on the bonus disk.  As Penn explains in the opening episode, they use the word ""bullh*t"" because they can't use words like `frauds' or `charlatans' without getting into a messy legal situation.  But it's frauds and charlatans they go after here, and they don't blunt the attack.  However, in the Randi interview they agree that the people who are duped by these charlatans are `victims,' and should be treated as such.  If someone close to you has died, for instance, you're probably vulnerable to someone who claims to communicate with the dead.  The unscrupulous actor here is the one making the supernatural claims, the guy who's profiting from another person's grief.  At times, though, the alien abductees, or the bottled water drinkers - yeah, there's an episode about bottled water - are held up to ridicule.  I was expecting a certain amount of superficiality and a lack of depth.  You can't handle the evolutionist/creationist battle in 25-television minutes without leaving out the finer debate points of both sides.  It's cool when they take off after someone who seeks to profit from spiritual readings, for instance, but sometimes P & T cross the line and ridicule the `victims', as well.  And that just comes off as bullying.  Still, if you're able to squirm though those bits, and want to be entertained rather than educated (or convinced), this is an enjoyable set.",4,BS First Season,1158364800,"09 16, 2006",2006,2211,"['Well', 'folks', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'take', 'em', 'one', 'spiritualist', 'environmentalists', 'anti-smoking', 'campaigners', 'alien', 'abductees', 'list', 'carried', 'second', 'season', 'worth', 'shows.I', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'aggressive', 'style', 'willingness', 'take', 'sour', 'delight', 'be', 'had', 'watching', 'episode', 'designed', 'outrage', 'intelligent', 'designers', 'then', 'later', 'one', ""'ll"", 'outrage', 'Green', 'Peacers', 'who', 'are', 'convinced', 'harmful', 'effects', 'second-hand', 'smoke', 'sure', 'are', ""n't"", 'sacred', 'cows', 'barn.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'love', 'series', 'most', 'part', 'did', 'indeed', 'very', 'much', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'carried', 'one', 'episode', 'next', 'was', 'something', 'mentioned', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'interview', 'Randi', 'spiritual', 'father', 'role', 'model', 'bonus', 'disk', 'Penn', 'opening', 'episode', 'use', 'word', 'bullh*t', 'ca', ""n't"", 'use', 'words', 'frauds', 'charlatans', 'getting', 'messy', 'legal', 'situation', 'frauds', 'charlatans', 'go', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'blunt', 'attack', 'However', 'Randi', 'interview', 'agree', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'duped', 'charlatans', 'are', 'victims', 'should', 'be', 'treated', 'such', 'someone', 'close', 'died', 'instance', ""'re"", 'probably', 'vulnerable', 'someone', 'who', 'communicate', 'dead', 'unscrupulous', 'actor', 'here', 'one', 'making', 'supernatural', 'claims', 'guy', 'who', 'profiting', 'person', 'grief', 'times', 'though', 'alien', 'abductees', 'bottled', 'water', 'drinkers', 'yeah', 'episode', 'bottled', 'water', 'are', 'held', 'up', 'ridicule', 'was', 'expecting', 'certain', 'amount', 'superficiality', 'lack', 'depth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'evolutionist/creationist', 'battle', '25-television', 'minutes', 'leaving', 'out', 'finer', 'debate', 'points', 'sides', 'cool', 'when', 'take', 'off', 'someone', 'who', 'profit', 'spiritual', 'readings', 'instance', 'sometimes', 'P', 'T', 'cross', 'line', 'ridicule', 'victims', 'well', 'just', 'off', 'bullying', 'Still', ""'re"", 'able', 'squirm', 'bits', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'rather', 'educated', 'convinced', 'enjoyable', 'set']",Penn & Teller - Bullsh*t! - The First Season
797151,A2ZZAPED8DHL07,B00019PDNY,The Best Out West,"[3, 7]","I had a free pass to Showtime and ran across this show by accident, so I decided to jump in for more.  At first I was enthralled.  Penn is extremely intelligent, charismatic and they throw in a lot of humor.  But the more I watched these episodes I found them to be very one sided, with one or two extremists as the enemy, and calm, level-headed protagonists championing their cause.For every argument they make, they have a pro and a con explanation.  The pro side is a person that they never make fun of, nor allow them to hang themself on any issue.  The con person is always someone from the far extreme.  It's as if they try to find the one person from that camp that is so far out there that they could actually be austrosized from that group, but that doesn't stop Penn and Teller from making them the representative.  So here we have a one sided, to the extreme, argument that proves that whatever it is that Penn and Teller don't believe in can't actually be true.  A great example of this is the argument against modified food and organic food.  Penn and Teller choose as their champion an individual that has created enough food to sustain over a billion people.  A real hero, doing hero's work.  Therefore, he has to be correct on everything he says.  The antagonists?  A group of individuals that only eat raw vegetables (because fire alters the chemicals in the plant), so much so that they use lettuce as a ""taco"" shell.  How can the people against modified food win this argument?  They can't because the cards are stacked against them.Now, with all that being said, there are some arguments that I actually believe Penn and Teller are correct. For instance, the global warming episode features a little segment where a petition is passed around to ban dihydrogen monoxide, also known as water.  It's advertised as ""being in our rivers, streams, oceans and it falls from the sky.  It's in everything you drink and most of the things you eat.""  People, according to them, were dying to sign this petition, and they exposed the fanaticism that accompanies the environmental activist movement.  However, since this is a television show, and it's edited, could they have possible just shown only the people that signed the petition?The whole point of the show is to not take everything at literal, face value.  To be skeptical of everything until you can't scientifically disprove it to be anything but genuine.  They've done a very good job, because now I do that with whatever comes out of their mouths (well, Penn's at least).",3,A little too one sided.,1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,2541,"['had', 'free', 'pass', 'Showtime', 'ran', 'show', 'accident', 'decided', 'jump', 'more', 'first', 'was', 'enthralled', 'Penn', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'charismatic', 'throw', 'lot', 'humor', 'more', 'watched', 'episodes', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'one', 'sided', 'one', 'two', 'extremists', 'enemy', 'calm', 'level-headed', 'protagonists', 'championing', 'cause.For', 'argument', 'make', 'have', 'pro', 'con', 'explanation', 'pro', 'side', 'person', 'never', 'make', 'fun', 'allow', 'hang', 'issue', 'con', 'person', 'always', 'someone', 'far', 'extreme', 'try', 'find', 'one', 'person', 'camp', 'so', 'far', 'there', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'austrosized', 'group', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'making', 'representative', 'So', 'here', 'have', 'one', 'sided', 'extreme', 'argument', 'whatever', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'actually', 'be', 'true', 'great', 'example', 'argument', 'modified', 'food', 'organic', 'food', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'choose', 'champion', 'individual', 'created', 'enough', 'food', 'sustain', 'billion', 'people', 'real', 'hero', 'doing', 'hero', 'work', 'Therefore', 'be', 'correct', 'everything', 'antagonists', 'group', 'individuals', 'only', 'eat', 'raw', 'vegetables', 'fire', 'alters', 'chemicals', 'plant', 'so', 'much', 'use', 'lettuce', 'taco', 'shell', 'How', 'can', 'people', 'modified', 'food', 'win', 'argument', 'ca', ""n't"", 'because', 'cards', 'are', 'stacked', 'them.Now', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'arguments', 'actually', 'believe', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'are', 'correct', 'instance', 'global', 'warming', 'episode', 'little', 'segment', 'where', 'petition', 'passed', 'ban', 'dihydrogen', 'monoxide', 'also', 'known', 'water', 'advertised', 'being', 'rivers', 'streams', 'oceans', 'sky', 'everything', 'drink', 'most', 'things', 'eat', 'People', 'according', 'were', 'dying', 'sign', 'petition', 'exposed', 'fanaticism', 'environmental', 'activist', 'movement', 'However', 'television', 'show', 'edited', 'could', 'have', 'possible', 'just', 'shown', 'only', 'people', 'signed', 'petition', 'whole', 'point', 'show', 'not', 'take', 'everything', 'literal', 'face', 'value', 'be', 'skeptical', 'everything', 'ca', ""n't"", 'scientifically', 'disprove', 'be', 'anything', 'genuine', ""'ve"", 'done', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'now', 'do', 'mouths', 'well', 'Penn', 'least']",Penn & Teller - Bullsh*t! - The First Season
