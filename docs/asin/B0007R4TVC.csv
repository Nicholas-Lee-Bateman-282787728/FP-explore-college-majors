888580,A2UQJK29MKIPGM,B0007R4TVC,Allen Bowers,"[1, 9]","What can I say but these three vampire movies are not just poorly done but are boring,kind of slow at times,and are nothing but an insult to both action movies and vampire movies in general!  First lest's start with John Carpenter's Vampire's of course.  Don't get me wrong I love James Woods as much as the next person but his performance in this movie as Catholic Church funded vampire hunter Jack Crow showcased not only some of his worst acting but also his character was a brutal,loud mouthed,pompous,arrogant,obnoxious,rude,egotistical,nihilistic creep!  He was not likable at all(and I feel that if you don't like the hero(oes) in the movie then what's the point) also besides being charmless,uncouth and sacriledgous he also had a bad temper!  And his partner  played by Baldwin brother Daniel was also unlikable not to mention really stupid and not beyond hitting a woman!  Worse than any of this is that the vampire action is in no way as awesome as the vampire action in Blade 1&2(Sorry but Blade Trinity was JUST HORRIBLE!), there weren't enough action scenes in this turkey anyway, and finally when there could have been more action at the end with them fighting the remaining vampires they DON'T EVEN SHOW THEM FIGHT THEM! Other than that there were some terms spoken by James Woods in particular that didn't even make sense! In closing this movie was James Wood's biggest carrer mistake since Videodrome! Next we go to John Carpenter's Vampire's Los Muertos.  I didn't hate this one as much as the first but this one was still an inferior vampire movie and definitely stunk! There's not even much to this one.  The characters in this one were all flat and under-developed.  Jon Bon Jovi's vampire hunter character in particular was throw in the mix abruptly with no explanation as to where he's from, how he got into vampire hunting in the first place or any history for him of any kind!  Darius Mccrary(Eddie Winslow from Family Matters) was not only uninteresting but also for some reason spoke like a 70 year old man.  And as for the mexican kid he let join him well there just wasn't much dimension to him.  The action was simple-minded and barely existant not to mention that of all the biggest threats they should try to stop it's all caused by a beautiful vampirella with few minions(Weak really weak). Also I feel that that later scene with the nurse and the quarantine going on developed the nurse as a character way too much!  In closing perhaps Jon Bon Jovi should just stick to singing!  And finally there's Vampire's The Turning(more like stomach turning).  There was just nothing to this seriously mediocre and cheesy vampire movie.  I don't have much to say about this one except there was nobody famous in it, the acting was pitiful as was the story, it was plodding at times, the special effects were too low budget(they especially scrimpted on the explosion at the end), I hated the actress who plays the main characters kidnapped girlfriend, and finally I was disappointed that in the sex scene between him and the hot asian babe shot all around the nudity!(BUMMER!). Beyond that this movie is too dull to talk about! In closing if you want to see some cool vampire movies try any Dracula movie,Blade 1&2,or even to the extent that it is a vampire movie NightWatch not this crap!",1,Three Vampire Movies That Just Plain Suck!(No Pun Intended),1192838400,"10 20, 2007",2007,3313,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'three', 'vampire', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'poorly', 'done', 'are', 'boring', 'kind', 'slow', 'times', 'are', 'nothing', 'insult', 'action', 'movies', 'vampire', 'movies', 'general', 'First', 'lest', 'start', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Vampire', 'course', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'James', 'Woods', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'person', 'performance', 'movie', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'funded', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'Jack', 'Crow', 'showcased', 'not', 'only', 'worst', 'acting', 'also', 'character', 'was', 'brutal', 'loud', 'mouthed', 'pompous', 'arrogant', 'obnoxious', 'rude', 'egotistical', 'nihilistic', 'creep', 'was', 'not', 'likable', 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'hero', 'oes', 'movie', 'then', 'what', 'point', 'also', 'being', 'charmless', 'uncouth', 'sacriledgous', 'also', 'had', 'bad', 'temper', 'partner', 'played', 'Baldwin', 'brother', 'Daniel', 'was', 'also', 'unlikable', 'not', 'mention', 'really', 'stupid', 'not', 'hitting', 'woman', 'Worse', 'vampire', 'action', 'way', 'as', 'awesome', 'vampire', 'action', 'Blade', '1', '2', 'Sorry', 'Blade', 'Trinity', 'was', 'JUST', 'HORRIBLE', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'action', 'scenes', 'turkey', 'anyway', 'finally', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'action', 'end', 'fighting', 'remaining', 'vampires', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'EVEN', 'SHOW', 'THEM', 'FIGHT', 'THEM', 'Other', 'were', 'terms', 'spoken', 'James', 'Woods', 'particular', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'sense', 'closing', 'movie', 'was', 'James', 'Wood', 'biggest', 'carrer', 'mistake', 'Videodrome', 'go', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Vampire', 'Los', 'Muertos', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'one', 'as', 'much', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'still', 'inferior', 'vampire', 'movie', 'definitely', 'stunk', 'not', 'even', 'much', 'one', 'characters', 'one', 'were', 'flat', 'under-developed', 'Jon', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'character', 'particular', 'was', 'throw', 'mix', 'abruptly', 'explanation', 'where', 'how', 'got', 'vampire', 'hunting', 'first', 'place', 'history', 'kind', 'Darius', 'Mccrary', 'Eddie', 'Winslow', 'Family', 'Matters', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'uninteresting', 'also', 'reason', 'spoke', '70', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'mexican', 'kid', 'let', 'join', 'well', 'there', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'dimension', 'action', 'was', 'simple-minded', 'barely', 'existant', 'not', 'mention', 'biggest', 'threats', 'should', 'try', 'stop', 'caused', 'beautiful', 'vampirella', 'few', 'minions', 'Weak', 'really', 'weak', 'Also', 'feel', 'later', 'scene', 'nurse', 'quarantine', 'going', 'developed', 'nurse', 'character', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'closing', 'perhaps', 'Jon', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'should', 'just', 'stick', 'singing', 'finally', 'Vampire', 'Turning', 'more', 'stomach', 'turning', 'was', 'just', 'nothing', 'seriously', 'mediocre', 'cheesy', 'vampire', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'say', 'one', 'was', 'nobody', 'famous', 'acting', 'was', 'pitiful', 'was', 'story', 'was', 'plodding', 'times', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'too', 'low', 'budget', 'especially', 'scrimpted', 'explosion', 'end', 'hated', 'actress', 'who', 'main', 'characters', 'kidnapped', 'girlfriend', 'finally', 'was', 'disappointed', 'sex', 'scene', 'hot', 'asian', 'babe', 'shot', 'nudity', 'BUMMER', 'Beyond', 'movie', 'too', 'dull', 'talk', 'closing', 'want', 'see', 'cool', 'vampire', 'movies', 'try', 'Dracula', 'movie', 'Blade', '1', '2', 'even', 'extent', 'vampire', 'movie', 'NightWatch', 'not', 'crap']",N/A

His fake sincerity and one-track-mindedness are unconvincing.  It's like those Chuck Norris movies you used to love to watch---they were alright as long as Chuck kept his mouth shut.

One is kidnaped by some biker vampires while her boyfriend is unable to save her.  But he does meet a mysterious character who kills one of the vampires and disappears.  The boyfriend follows the stranger to a forbidding old house.  He then tries to enlist the aid of the local police but gets no help.  The mysterious stranger seems to be his only hope.  He tracks him down and we find out what is going on.The city has two types of vampires.  The oldest do not drink human blood.  They keep to animals.  They do not like the second type although they accidentally created them.  The second type revels in human blood and killing.  They fully embrace their power.  The first group is led by a woman who was the first vampire.  There is a chance that she can break the curse that turned her into a vampire.  If the curse is broken, all the vampires who sprang from her will become human again.  The second type vampires do not want to be human again.  The whole concept leads to some very interesting situations.Other than the idea of bounty hunters going after vampires (and the use of a winch) there is no resemblance to the earlier films.  This is based on a completely different mythology.  Vampires are killed in different ways and turning into a vampire after being bitten is an act of will.  So don't expect this to really be part of a series.  By itself it is a very interesting take on the vampire legend and very stylistically handled.

888594,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0007R4TVC,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Vampires: The Turning (Marty Weiss, 2005)What's ultimately so awful about John Carpenter's 1998 snoozefest Vampires is not the movie itself, but the way Hollywood has raped the stinking corpse, first with 2002's moronic Jon Bon Jovi vehicle Los Muertos, and now with 2005's kickboxing-vampire flick The Turning. Yes, you heard me right. Kickboxing vampires. It's like The Twins Effect, but without the cute Cantonese pop singers, the comedy, or the relatively decent names that starred in that one. In fact, this one has... nothing of worth. At all.Connor (All My Children's Colin Egglesfield--yes, the lead actor is a soap opera star) is a kickboxer who's visiting Thailand with his girlfriend Amanda (mmmmm mmmmm mmmmMeredith Monroe from Dawson's Creek). At least, that's the way it's supposed to go, except that Meredith breaks up with him after one too many kickboxing matches and stalks off into the crowd. She is picked up by Niran (Dom Hetrakul form the recent Bangkok Dangerous remake), a slick vampire who happens to lead a gang of vampire bikers. (Yes, vampire bikers. Think Cyclo without any talent. And with vampires.) Connor goes head to head with one of Niran's flunkies, and things look nasty until help comes in the form of Kiko (Bulletproof Monk's Roger Yuan), who's got a very big sword. Connor, desperate to get Amanda back, pesters Kiko's group, headed by mysterious and beautiful Sang (ZigZag's Stephanie Chao), for information about Niran and his band. And then, well, on the off chance you actually want to see this, I'll stop before we get into spoiler-land. I'm sure you know exactly where this is going, however.My wife came home about ten minutes before the end of this last night, watched a bit, and asked me, ""and you thought Twilight was bad?"" While my response was exactly what was expected (""these vampires don't sparkle""), yeah, I thought Twilight was bad. Awful, in fact. But it was Oscar material compared to this dreck. Rumor has it that John Carpenter was originally attached as an executive producer, but dropped out at some point in the process to be replaced by J. S. Cardone, who's made a habit of bankrolling crap recently (8MM 2, The Covenant, and the Prom Night remake were all partially financed by Cardone). No idea how true that is, but were I Carpenter, my response to seeing what they'd done with my legacy would have been a lot more violent. I mean, jeez, this is even worse than the remake of The Fog that came out the same year. Avoid like the plague. *",1,Kickboxing vampires.
