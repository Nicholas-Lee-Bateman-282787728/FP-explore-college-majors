1637339,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00BPGLNOK,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","I've never been a huge fan of the highly formulaic `romantic comedy' (aka rom/com) film.  It isn't that I think romance is dead, either.  Actually, it isn't for the typical reason, so let me clarify precisely why: I generally can't see most Hollywood male leads cast into these features as being legitimate romantic leads.  I mean ... Hugh Grant?  Really?  I'm supposed to believe he has romance problems?  With his underwear model good looks?  Sure, I get that he plays these fops with tremendous ease, but the only time I bought his regular shtick was in the underrated THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL BUT CAME DOWN A MOUNTAIN, and I liked that far more for the ensemble than I did anything Hugh brought to the picture.No, for a rom/com to work for me, the man has to look and actually sound the bumbling male part ... kind of like Jonas Chernick manages to pull off in AN AWKWARD SEXUAL ADVENTURE.  Everything about the man screams `boring,' and he plays the uptight accountant Jordan with such convincing ease one might wonder if Chernick himself has experienced some of the same ""shortcomings"" in the romance department behind-the-scenes, especially given the fact that he also wrote the screenplay.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Dumped by his longtime gal pal Rachel (played by the lovely Sarah Manninen) because he's got no mojo in the sack, Jordan Abrams (the aforementioned Chernick) heads off to Toronto for his annual getaway hoping his buddy and male-slut friend Dandak (Vik Sahay) might teach him some moves that'll win the lady back.  Sulking in his own despair, Jordan finds his way into the life of a local stripper - Julia (Emily Hampshire) - who agrees to show him how to be a real man in exchange for his assistance in getting her financial life in order.  Of course, modest hilarity ensues, as does an unanticipated true love of the highest order as Julia begins to succumb to the math nerd she's invited into her affairs.There's much of AN AWKWARD SEXUAL ADVENTURE that does rely on the usual formula employed by the rom/com since its inception in all of filmdom - the uptight guy, the uptight gal, the easy breezy woman who's wise in carnal ways, etc. - and most of the laughs emerge rather naturally from the anticipated if not expected interplay.  All of the players here - Chernick, Sahay, Manninen, and Hampshire - have their `notes' to hit, and they manage quite nicely to go from one `beat' to another with enough charm to make a believer out of any skeptic in the audience.Chernick's first impulse is to find some way despite the distance between he and his lover is exactly what one would anticipate - to find a way to make her so jealous that she wants him back - and the plot unfolds rather organically after his visit to the strip club mostly ends in Tweeted pictures of disaster.  However, through a comedy-of-errors I won't spoil, Julia takes the man back to her apartment and stages a real picture - one of Jordan successfully seducing her - that puts the romance into this rom/com, and its Hampshire's disarming charm that fuels much of what unfolds once the teacher and the student relationship has been established.  She plays wonderfully off of Chernick's ""nebbishness,"" so much so that I'm convinced that the picture - in any other two players' hands - probably wouldn't have worked as well as it did in the end.  What starts out stoically eventually turns into something playful and that almost always leads into matters of the heart, as it does here in this lovely charmer starring two talents worth watching in the future.And, yes, in case you're heard about it, there's a love scene involving a cantaloupe that's probably worth the price of a rental alone.  Bon appetit, y'all!AN AWKWARD SEXUAL ADVENTURE (2012) (originally titled MY AWKWARD SEXUAL ADVENTURE) is produced by Julijette, Banana-Moon Sky Films, and Kosher Sexy Films.  DVD distribution is being handled through Cinedigm.  As for the technical specifications, the film looks and sounds very solid consistently.  Lastly - as appears customary with these releases coming with the Tribeca Film stamp of approval - there's an all-too-brief behind-the-scenes interviews with the cast and crew that mostly survives as a bloated `coming attractions' short with very little substance: it's nice to have, but it ain't nothin' all that special, and I would've liked to know more.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Inevitably, what makes any romantic comedy work is the chemistry of its leads, and, in that respect, stars Chernick and Hampshire send just the right amount of sparks as the dour, sexually-underskilled accountant and the big city dancer, respectively.  The story?  Meh, it could've used a few brush-ups, but, all-in-all, it's a winning update of the classic formula: boy-meets-girl, girl-teaches-boy-a-few-tricks, girl-loses-boy, but true-love-wins-out-in-the-end anyway.  A fractured fairy tale, indeed.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Cinedigm provided me with a DVD copy of AN AWKWARD SEXUAL ADVENTURE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,Charming Leads Bring New Life (And Fruit!)

1637342,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BPGLNOK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[7, 7]","With its provocative DVD cover and its racy title, you might think you know what to expect from the Canadian indie ""An Awkward Sexual Adventure.""  And, in many ways, you'd be right.  But using all the conventions that you would anticipate from a bawdy sex romp, the picture subverts them into a wholly unique experience.  Can a movie be both in-you-face and gentle?  Can it be explicit and sweet?  The answer, in my estimation, is yes.  ""An Awkward Sexual Adventure"" is surprisingly adept as a relationship drama, a journey of self-discovery, and as a blossoming romance.  Through it all, though, it is also laugh out loud funny giving its audience plenty of raunchy humor and uncomfortable situations.  I'll be honest.  I saw the cover of the DVD (with a tantalizingly placed melon) and I instantly sized up the picture.  Sure to attract a male audience looking for a crude and lewd experience, the movie offers more than its share of pleasures for the female crowd as well.  Yes, this is really a date movie that everyone can enjoy (more There's Something About Mary than American Pie).  The women in ""An Awkward Sexual Adventure"" aren't just conquests, they help to make the men better people.Jonas Chernick (who also penned the screenplay) plays a repressed accountant who starts the picture being dumped by his long time girlfriend (Sarah Manninen).  It's pretty brutal, to be honest, but she is clearly unsatisfied in a number of important ways.  Chernick goes on a pre-scheduled vacation at the same time, but is still convinced he can recapture his love's attention.  His best friend (Vik Sahay) promises him a liberating sexual experience, but his plans go awry when he finds himself in a more traditional relationship himself.  That leaves Chernick to his own devices, and his master plan is to evoke jealousy by photographing himself with an array of lovely women.  One boozy night later, he finds himself in the apartment of a comely dancer (Emily Hampshire) who rescued him from the club's parking lot.  She needs financial help, he needs sexual education.  This could be the start of a beautiful friendship.  She will be his mentor in getting his ex-girlfriend back and her prescribed curriculum is unorthodox at best.  Through the process, though, Chernick discovers more about himself than he anticipated.Truthfully, nothing in the actual plotting of ""An Awkward Sexual Adventure"" is particularly surprising.  But this is more about the journey than arriving at the destination.  The picture has a assured charm and an easiness about sex that is quite refreshing.  Chernick gives an accomplished performance, but Hampshire is an absolute find.  Sexy, confident, vulnerable, she takes what might have been a stock character and makes her someone you really care about!  Much to my surprise, I was invested in the relationship central to this quirky little sex movie on both an emotional and an intellectual level.  But lest I make everything sound too sappy or sweet, the movie is also terrifically funny in the most inappropriate ways.  A sleeper that deserves to be discovered by a wider audience, this is simply a good time.  I enjoyed it immensely, so give it a try.  As an aside, it won the People's Choice Award at the Calgary International Film Festival.  KGHarris, 8/13.",4,Profane And Romantic?

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[0, 0]","This film has a lot in common with the above two films - from the box cover - to the casual nudity but this film was made in Canada with a lot of financial participation from the Canadian Government and Film Board. That gives it a bit more cred in some eyes.  There is a serious ""love story going on here"" and there's a few winks to Julia Roberts' hooker role in ""Pretty Woman"" - only the lead actress (none are well-known in the US) plays a stripper her - who does give lap dances (and maybe more!) to the club customers. The actress, Emily Hampshire, sure reminded me of a young Sally Field - and has a similar hairdo. The language is raw and there is a good deal of nudity, but what else would you expect. The Film stars the screenwriter and he gives himself the juiciest role. Oftentimes I found the action a bit silly but then said ""hey, this is an independent film after all"". There are enough pop songs on the soundtrack to actually distract you from the action but I guess there are a lot of up-and-coming Canadian pop songwriters who want exposure.I can't say I loved the 98-minute film, but I did like it and enjoyed the time I spent with it. There is only one bonus feature and that is a short 3  minute ""Behind the Scenes"" which is really a few interviews with Director and cast members mixed with lots of clips from the film itself.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,"It's ""40-year old Virgin"" and ""Pretty Woman""  with a Canadian slant",1376265600,"08 12, 2013",2013,1436,"['film', 'lot', 'common', 'above', 'two', 'films', 'box', 'cover', 'casual', 'nudity', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Canada', 'lot', 'financial', 'participation', 'Canadian', 'Government', 'Film', 'Board', 'bit', 'more', 'cred', 'eyes', 'serious', 'love', 'story', 'going', 'here', 'few', 'winks', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'hooker', 'role', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'only', 'lead', 'actress', 'none', 'are', 'well-known', 'US', 'stripper', 'who', 'give', 'lap', 'dances', 'maybe', 'more', 'club', 'customers', 'actress', 'Emily', 'Hampshire', 'sure', 'reminded', 'young', 'Sally', 'Field', 'similar', 'hairdo', 'language', 'raw', 'good', 'deal', 'nudity', 'what', 'else', 'would', 'expect', 'Film', 'screenwriter', 'juiciest', 'role', 'found', 'action', 'bit', 'silly', 'then', 'said', 'hey', 'independent', 'film', 'are', 'enough', 'pop', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'actually', 'distract', 'action', 'guess', 'are', 'lot', 'up-and-coming', 'Canadian', 'pop', 'songwriters', 'who', 'want', 'exposure.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'loved', '98-minute', 'film', 'did', 'like', 'enjoyed', 'time', 'spent', 'only', 'one', 'bonus', 'feature', 'short', '3', 'minute', 'Scenes', 'really', 'few', 'interviews', 'Director', 'cast', 'members', 'mixed', 'lots', 'clips', 'film', 'itself.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",An Awkward Sexual Adventure
