But, X-Men: Evolution is a great show as well.With the long awaited release of the mid-90's animated cartoon of the X-Men, we can only hope that this season will get taken a look at again.  Its a real shame that they only realeased 3 of the 4 seasons.  Also, the handling of the first 2 seasons wasn't too great either, with only season 3 seeing a proper complete full season release.  Now that Disney holds the rights to Marvel, maybe they will release season 4, and possibly season 1 and 2 as well.  However, Disney isn't known for giving what the fans truly want...Studios, please, please, please relase season 4 of X-Men: Evolution, and while you are at it, please re-release seasons 1 and 2 as full complete season's as well.  Thanks in advance!!!!",5,4th Season Please!!!!,1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,883,"['Love', 'love', 'love', 'show', 'X-Men', 'animated', 'series', 'really', 'love', 'current', ""'Wolverine"", 'X-Men', 'series', 'X-Men', 'Evolution', 'great', 'show', 'well.With', 'long', 'awaited', 'release', 'mid-90', 'animated', 'cartoon', 'X-Men', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'season', 'will', 'get', 'taken', 'look', 'again', 'real', 'shame', 'only', 'realeased', '3', '4', 'seasons', 'Also', 'handling', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'great', 'only', 'season', '3', 'seeing', 'proper', 'complete', 'full', 'season', 'release', 'Now', 'Disney', 'rights', 'Marvel', 'maybe', 'will', 'release', 'season', '4', 'possibly', 'season', '1', '2', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'Disney', ""n't"", 'known', 'giving', 'what', 'fans', 'truly', 'want', 'Studios', 'please', 'please', 'please', 'relase', 'season', '4', 'X-Men', 'Evolution', 'are', 'please', 're-release', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'full', 'complete', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'Thanks', 'advance']",X-Men: Evolution: Season 4
