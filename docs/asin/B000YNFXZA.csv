1120266,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000YNFXZA,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","White Noise 2 features a storyline basically consisting of a male actor who happens to look remarkably similar to Jason Bateman walking around a city and seeing brightly colored flashing images surrounding ANY person about ready to die in a tragic sudden way, whether it be children, women or men.  So what does this mean?It means, for most of the film, the main character tries his very best to save all the people about to unexpectedly kick the bucket.  Does he succeed?  I wanna yell with a resounding ""YES!"" but eh... not necessarily.  Sometimes he saves lives, other times he fails.  There's some good action and suspense in wondering who will survive and who won't, however.  Do NOT expect to really get to know most of the people he saves- keep this in mind.  Many times these people appear once, and that's it- you never see them again.Immediately you will probably notice that the film writers took a pretty cool concept from the original and beat it into the ground with White Noise 2.  The suspense does not really come from the unusual spiritual messages being seen and heard from the other side- more like the suspense comes from a man running around town saving as many lives as possible.Whenever you see a flashing image of a deadly spirit being shown on a TV screen or any kind of electronic, it just doesn't have the same kind of heart-pumping impact that it did in the original White Noise.  For that, the film is a minor disappointment because there's no real atmosphere or for that matter, no real direction either.  The segments where the main character tries to understand what's going on by doing extensive research and solving math problems aren't exactly memorable either.I can't really say you should skip White Noise 2 because if you like gimmicky horror that feels relatively low budget, the movie works great.  However it's not the real deal like the first one.

1120268,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B000YNFXZA,Dave. K,"[7, 7]","Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person who actually liked the original White Noise. While far from a great movie I thought it was enjoyable even if forgettable. Going into White Noise 2 my expectations were quite low. Even though I did enjoy the original I didn't really have high hopes, but like the original being a decent surprise so was the sequel. By no means is this a great movie and like the previous at the end of the day it is forgettable, but overall I thought White Noise was a decent surprise. White Noise 2 is a stand-alone sequel; there is no connection between the 2 movies, this is just a sequel by name only.White Noise 2 does continue the EVP concept, but now adds near death experience to the mix. I thought White Noise 2 had a pretty decent idea and some elements work and others seem to lack. Writer Matt Venne actually writes a pretty decent script. I sort of see this movie as a White Noise meets The Dead Zone. Instead of a man with psychic visions the lead character sees a white light and that's how he knows who is in danger. Matt Venne doesn't really bring us anything exactly new to this genre, but he does write a script that does have some creative moments. This movie is a little smarter than most people would think. White Noise 2 is very much a character driven movie rather than action and Venne does a good job.Director Patrick Lussier does a good job at brining everything to life. There are moments where the pacing might be a little on the slow side, but he always manages to keep things from getting too slow. Though there are moments where the pacing was a little too slow. There is little to no scares. If you've seen enough horror movies the scares are quite predictable, but there is some decent tension. For the most part Lussier does keep the movie interesting; this isn't an Iconic directing job, but good enough to make an interesting movie.Like I said White Noise 2 is very character driven and Nathan Fillion is excellent in the lead role as Abe Dale. The makers got very lucky in landing Fillion who is a very talented actor. He really makes this movie a lot better than maybe it should have been. He's in pretty much every scene and he does a great job at carrying the movie. Katee Sackhoff as Sherry Clarke also delivers an excellent performance. She's a very talented actress and manages to light up the screen in every scene she appears in. Her character is a lot of fun and Katee really seems to be enjoying herself and any character who lists Bride of Frankenstein as their favorite movie is my kinda girl.When all is said and done White Noise 2 isn't a great movie by any means, but does serve as a decent time killer. Odds are if you liked the original you'll probably like this, even if you didn't like the original you might like this since it's not a continuation. White Noise 2 had the potential to be a lot more than it was, but at the end of the day it might be sort of forgettable, but White Noise 2 is actually a fairly good movie.",3,"Better than you may think, but could have been more",1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,3002,"['Sometimes', 'feel', ""'m"", 'only', 'person', 'who', 'actually', 'liked', 'original', 'White', 'Noise', 'far', 'great', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'forgettable', 'Going', 'White', 'Noise', '2', 'expectations', 'were', 'quite', 'low', 'Even', 'did', 'enjoy', 'original', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'original', 'being', 'decent', 'surprise', 'so', 'was', 'sequel', 'means', 'great', 'movie', 'previous', 'end', 'day', 'forgettable', 'overall', 'thought', 'White', 'Noise', 'was', 'decent', 'surprise', 'White', 'Noise', '2', 'stand-alone', 'sequel', 'connection', '2', 'movies', 'just', 'sequel', 'name', 'only.White', 'Noise', '2', 'continue', 'EVP', 'concept', 'now', 'death', 'experience', 'mix', 'thought', 'White', 'Noise', '2', 'had', 'pretty', 'decent', 'idea', 'elements', 'work', 'others', 'seem', 'lack', 'Writer', 'Matt', 'Venne', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'script', 'sort', 'see', 'movie', 'White', 'Noise', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'Instead', 'man', 'psychic', 'visions', 'lead', 'character', 'white', 'light', 'how', 'who', 'danger', 'Matt', 'Venne', ""n't"", 'really', 'bring', 'anything', 'exactly', 'new', 'genre', 'write', 'script', 'have', 'creative', 'moments', 'movie', 'little', 'smarter', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'think', 'White', 'Noise', '2', 'very', 'much', 'character', 'driven', 'movie', 'rather', 'action', 'Venne', 'good', 'job.Director', 'Patrick', 'Lussier', 'good', 'job', 'brining', 'everything', 'life', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'pacing', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'slow', 'side', 'always', 'keep', 'things', 'getting', 'too', 'slow', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'pacing', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'slow', 'little', 'scares', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', 'horror', 'movies', 'scares', 'are', 'quite', 'predictable', 'decent', 'tension', 'most', 'part', 'Lussier', 'keep', 'movie', 'interesting', ""n't"", 'Iconic', 'directing', 'job', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'interesting', 'movie.Like', 'said', 'White', 'Noise', '2', 'very', 'character', 'driven', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'excellent', 'lead', 'role', 'Abe', 'Dale', 'makers', 'got', 'very', 'lucky', 'landing', 'Fillion', 'who', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'really', 'movie', 'lot', 'better', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'much', 'scene', 'great', 'job', 'carrying', 'movie', 'Katee', 'Sackhoff', 'Sherry', 'Clarke', 'also', 'excellent', 'performance', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'scene', 'character', 'lot', 'fun', 'Katee', 'really', 'be', 'enjoying', 'character', 'who', 'Bride', 'Frankenstein', 'favorite', 'movie', 'kinda', 'girl.When', 'said', 'done', 'White', 'Noise', '2', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'means', 'serve', 'decent', 'time', 'killer', 'Odds', 'are', 'liked', 'original', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'original', 'might', 'like', 'not', 'continuation', 'White', 'Noise', '2', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'was', 'end', 'day', 'might', 'be', 'sort', 'forgettable', 'White', 'Noise', '2', 'actually', 'fairly', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

Shocked, he mourns the loss of his family uncontrollably until he can take it no more and attempts suicide. But as he makes his way into that ever spoken of white light, doctors resuscitate him and he returns to the land of the living.Thus begins a tale that seems to be headed one direction before it takes a disastrous turn. Now returned to life, Nathan begins to see auras around various people he encounters, including a doctor attempting to help him. The doctor describes the things Nathan sees and hears as a form of EVP or electronic voice phenomena (a phenomena paranormal researchers actually use).But things go bad as the people he sees begin to die. Nathan realizes that he has the ability to save their lives and begins doing so, including a young nurse who consoled him in the hospital.That nasty twist? It seems that once you save someone's life you become responsible for all actions taken thereafter. And since they were taken away from their time to die, they turn around and kill others. As Nathan digs deeper into the man who killed his family's past, he discovers him alive. He also finds out that the man was doing so only because he had saved them earlier. And they would have become killers just like the others he had saved.Faced with this knowledge, Nathan must now go out and find those that he helped and stop them from killing. Caught in the conundrum of realizing he must take life when his whole goal was to save them, the moral questions Nathan deals with make this movie a complex thriller that keeps you in suspense.Fillion turns in a wonderful performance, as he always does. The goal of an actor is to not seem to be acting and in all I've had the fortune of seeing him do, I've felt that in each role even when he faces the afterlife or squishy monsters (as in SLITHER).

1120280,A1ZM846Y7AUYD,B000YNFXZA,M. Pickering,"[3, 3]","I loved the first White Noise movie.  The whole concept of EVP just fascinates me.  When I heard that there was going to be a White Noise 2, I just had to have it.This movie certainly does not pickup where the original left off.  It is a clean slate from the beginning.  There is no slow, boring lead in.  The whole story line was laid out in a clever and relatively quick fashion.  It is a little confusing at first but this adds to the suspense.  The special effects are good, at times, but nothing overly exciting.  The jump factor of this film was a bit weak.  Sure, there are some scenes that have the typical sudden flashes that make you jump a bit, but with a movie like this you would expect a bit more.  My wife hates horror films that make you jump, so she was quite happy with the overall mild fear factor of this film.  =o)Overall I was quite pleased with this film and glad that I purchased the DVD for my collection.  It is nearly as good as the original White Noise, but just lacks a little punch.  The ending was somewhat confusing and leaves a bit to each viewers imagination.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  The story keeps your attention, the directing seems good, the choice of actors and their associated performances are very good.  As a comparison I think I would rate the first White Noise a 5, while I consider White Noise 2 a 4 and 1/2.  It is a great film that I recommend to everyone.  I guess I just didn't get the same thrill from this film as I did the original.  Maybe the whole ""Near Death Experience"" concept just isn't quite as mysterious to me as it might be for others.  I suggest you see the movie and judge for yourself.  If you enjoyed the first White Noise movie, I'm sure you will not be dissapointed with this one.",4,White Noise 2 = Great Film But Could Have Used A Little More Punch,1200096000,"01 12, 2008",2008,1764,"['loved', 'first', 'White', 'Noise', 'movie', 'whole', 'concept', 'EVP', 'just', 'When', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'White', 'Noise', '2', 'just', 'had', 'have', 'it.This', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'pickup', 'where', 'original', 'left', 'off', 'clean', 'slate', 'beginning', 'slow', 'boring', 'lead', 'whole', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'laid', 'out', 'clever', 'relatively', 'quick', 'fashion', 'little', 'confusing', 'first', 'suspense', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'times', 'nothing', 'overly', 'exciting', 'jump', 'factor', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'weak', 'Sure', 'are', 'scenes', 'have', 'typical', 'sudden', 'flashes', 'make', 'jump', 'bit', 'movie', 'would', 'expect', 'bit', 'more', 'wife', 'horror', 'films', 'make', 'jump', 'was', 'quite', 'happy', 'overall', 'mild', 'fear', 'factor', 'film', '=o', 'Overall', 'was', 'quite', 'pleased', 'film', 'glad', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'collection', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'White', 'Noise', 'just', 'little', 'punch', 'ending', 'was', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'bit', 'viewers', 'imagination', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'story', 'attention', 'directing', 'good', 'choice', 'actors', 'associated', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'comparison', 'think', 'would', 'rate', 'first', 'White', 'Noise', '5', 'consider', 'White', 'Noise', '2', '4', '1/2', 'great', 'film', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'guess', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'same', 'thrill', 'film', 'did', 'original', 'Maybe', 'whole', 'Death', 'Experience', 'concept', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'mysterious', 'might', 'be', 'others', 'suggest', 'see', 'movie', 'judge', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'White', 'Noise', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'dissapointed', 'one']",N/A

Zveris,"[1, 1]","**Dear John,There are spoilers.XOXO Jane**I was very confused when I watched this movie because I thought it was going to be a sequel to White Noise.  The two are so very different that I can't really consider this to be a follow-up and so I am going to treat it like a related but very separate movie for the purpose of reviewing.On one hand I really liked this movie; I thought it was an interesting paranormal / Biblical slant to take for a film.  On the other hand I also found this movie really amusing by the end.  I wasn't entirely expecting the direction that the film went in which is what made me settle on a three instead of a two for the rating.  On a technical note:The movie has some very decent and very bad acting all mixed together; this makes it hard to stomach at certain points.  There are moments where the suspense is taken away by the hilarity of facial expressions, it almost bordered on B-Movie quality at a few points.  Then the next moment we're faced with some really well done dramatic scenes that draw you back in.  It left me feeling pulled away from the movie instead of immersed in it.You can at certain points in the movie (eg: ambulance scene at the end) actually see the camera which should have been caught in editing.The premise of becoming an ""un-tuned receiver"" able to pick up on white noise and the paranormal activity that resides within it was really interesting, along with the interpretations of what the white light (aura, halo, what have you) around individuals signified.  I wish that had been fleshed out more deeply, instead by the time we reached that point of the film it's a rush to the ending.  I almost wished that White Noise 2 had been about Henry Caine (played by Craig Fairbrass) instead of Abe Dale (aka: Captain Hammer - Nathan Fillion), he seemed like a far more interesting character and I wanted to know more about him.We don't really end up knowing a lot about any of the characters in the film, even Abe seemed very distant.  We aren't sure exactly what he does, or his friend, or how he feels about much of anything.  He's there, he's playing God, and he'd getting his just desserts for it while being terrified of ghosts simultaneously haunting and leading him to those about to die.  I didn't feel any real attachment to him or the other characters, they just were and that was it.Really the movie fell apart at the end for me; it just drifted off into the land of Happy Endings near the Eep! What Happened? ocean.  It isn't horrible though, and it is decent enough to watch once.  I would never see it again or suggest it to a friend, but it isn't a complete waste of time to see and you may end up liking it for all the little flaws.  I don't know why this is a sequel though, the only thing they have in common is (loosely) the phenomena of White Noise and people dying.",3,Captain Hammer's new job?,1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,2843,"['**Dear', 'John', 'are', 'spoilers.XOXO', 'Jane**I', 'was', 'very', 'confused', 'when', 'watched', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'sequel', 'White', 'Noise', 'two', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'different', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'consider', 'be', 'follow-up', 'so', 'am', 'going', 'treat', 'related', 'very', 'separate', 'movie', 'purpose', 'reviewing.On', 'one', 'hand', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'paranormal', '/', 'Biblical', 'slant', 'take', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'also', 'found', 'movie', 'really', 'amusing', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'expecting', 'direction', 'film', 'went', 'what', 'made', 'settle', 'three', 'instead', 'two', 'rating', 'technical', 'note', 'movie', 'very', 'decent', 'very', 'bad', 'acting', 'mixed', 'together', 'hard', 'stomach', 'certain', 'points', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'suspense', 'taken', 'away', 'hilarity', 'facial', 'expressions', 'almost', 'bordered', 'B-Movie', 'quality', 'few', 'points', 'Then', 'next', 'moment', ""'re"", 'faced', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'draw', 'back', 'left', 'feeling', 'pulled', 'away', 'movie', 'instead', 'immersed', 'it.You', 'can', 'certain', 'points', 'movie', 'eg', 'ambulance', 'scene', 'end', 'actually', 'see', 'camera', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'caught', 'editing.The', 'premise', 'becoming', 'un-tuned', 'receiver', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'white', 'noise', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'interpretations', 'what', 'white', 'light', 'aura', 'halo', 'what', 'have', 'individuals', 'signified', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'more', 'deeply', 'instead', 'time', 'reached', 'point', 'film', 'rush', 'ending', 'almost', 'wished', 'White', 'Noise', '2', 'had', 'been', 'Henry', 'Caine', 'played', 'Craig', 'Fairbrass', 'instead', 'Abe', 'Dale', 'aka', 'Captain', 'Hammer', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'seemed', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'him.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'end', 'up', 'knowing', 'lot', 'characters', 'film', 'even', 'Abe', 'seemed', 'very', 'distant', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'exactly', 'what', 'friend', 'how', 'about', 'much', 'anything', 'there', 'playing', 'God', ""'d"", 'getting', 'just', 'desserts', 'being', 'terrified', 'ghosts', 'simultaneously', 'haunting', 'leading', 'die', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'real', 'attachment', 'other', 'characters', 'just', 'were', 'was', 'it.Really', 'movie', 'fell', 'apart', 'end', 'just', 'drifted', 'off', 'land', 'Happy', 'Endings', 'Eep', 'What', 'Happened', 'ocean', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'decent', 'enough', 'watch', 'once', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'suggest', 'friend', ""n't"", 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'see', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'liking', 'little', 'flaws', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'sequel', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'common', 'loosely', 'phenomena', 'White', 'Noise', 'people', 'dying']",N/A
