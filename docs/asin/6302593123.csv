321665,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,6302593123,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[2, 3]","The late,great Luciano Pavarotti plays a philandering opera singer who carries on a brief,passionate affair with his throat doctor (think of 'Bridges of Madison County'!)Yes,there are picturesque scenes in the Napa Valley,of which I am most proud--but the story itself is wanting.Pavarotti's role in this movie is prophetic,since he divorced his wife of 3 decades to marry his much younger secretary.Hmmmm....was this film a warning sign?Early on in the movie,Pavarotti (as the singer ""Giorgio""),has performance anxiety before the Boston Pops. He loses his voice. His beautiful throat doctor helps him get it back. They enjoy a lavish stay in San Francisco,they travel in a hot balloon over the Napa Valley,they go to a winery. They engage in a food fight as foreplay.There is some beautiful music,and Pavarotti's singing saves the movie from being a complete waste. In the end,Giorgio tells his beautiful doctor that he has to return to his wife and family..not before having an electrifying concert. Like ""Bridges of Madison County"",""Yes Giorgio"" treats an adulterous affair as a life-changing,life-affirming event. The plot is awful,the acting melodramatic,but the music is the delicious bottle of Chianti that makes the movie's Parmesan cheesiness go down easy.",2,Your cheatin' heart...,1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,1265,"['late', 'great', 'Luciano', 'Pavarotti', 'philandering', 'opera', 'singer', 'who', 'brief', 'passionate', 'affair', 'throat', 'doctor', 'think', ""'Bridges"", 'Madison', 'County', 'Yes', 'are', 'picturesque', 'scenes', 'Napa', 'Valley', 'am', 'most', 'proud', 'story', 'role', 'movie', 'prophetic', 'divorced', 'wife', '3', 'decades', 'marry', 'much', 'younger', 'secretary.Hmmmm', 'film', 'warning', 'sign', 'Early', 'movie', 'Pavarotti', 'singer', 'Giorgio', 'performance', 'anxiety', 'Boston', 'Pops', 'voice', 'beautiful', 'throat', 'doctor', 'get', 'back', 'enjoy', 'lavish', 'stay', 'San', 'Francisco', 'travel', 'hot', 'balloon', 'Napa', 'Valley', 'go', 'winery', 'engage', 'food', 'fight', 'foreplay.There', 'beautiful', 'music', 'Pavarotti', 'singing', 'movie', 'being', 'complete', 'waste', 'end', 'Giorgio', 'beautiful', 'doctor', 'return', 'wife', 'family..not', 'having', 'electrifying', 'concert', 'Bridges', 'Madison', 'County', 'Yes', 'Giorgio', 'adulterous', 'affair', 'life-changing', 'life-affirming', 'event', 'plot', 'awful', 'acting', 'melodramatic', 'music', 'delicious', 'bottle', 'Chianti', 'movie', 'Parmesan', 'cheesiness', 'go', 'down', 'easy']",N/A
321666,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,6302593123,Brent Butler,"[0, 0]","I hate giving this film three stars. We were some of the few people who actually saw it in the theater, enjoyed it, and it has a lot going for it. It's an amusing if somewhat trite romance, and Pavarotti is by no means an accomplished film actor.But anyone putting their attention on those elements are missing the main draw of this movie: Pavarotti performing wonderful music on screen at the height of his talent.He was certainly one of the best operatic tenors the world has yet seen. His talented and highly trained voice delivered signature performances of many arias, and his most popular work is prominently displayed in this film. That makes it worth watching if you are a fan of his music.But here's the bad news about this DVD:* This picture is just adequate. It's about TV antennae broadcast (or VHS tape) quality. It isn't sharp and film damage artifacts are frequent.* This sound is mono. That's a pretty bad mistake to make on a film that's all about the music. The film originally had a nice Dolby soundtrack that SHOULD have been reproduced for this DVD.Here's the good news:* There is a DVD for this movie. There wasn't for a VERY long time, and often movies that did as poorly at the box office as this film don't get a release at all.Luckily our receiver will ""upscale"" a mono track to simulate stereo, so we're not as badly off as some viewers of this might be.If you like this film and like Pavarotti, at least you can get it now, and that's worth the three stars. I deduct one for the complete lack of attention to the film quality, and another for putting it out with a mono soundtrack.I got it for my wife for Christmas and she's totally happy about that. :-)Recommended with the above caveats.",3,Great film - so so DVD,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,1718,"['hate', 'giving', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'were', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'saw', 'theater', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'going', 'amusing', 'somewhat', 'trite', 'romance', 'Pavarotti', 'means', 'accomplished', 'film', 'anyone', 'putting', 'attention', 'elements', 'are', 'missing', 'main', 'draw', 'movie', 'Pavarotti', 'performing', 'wonderful', 'music', 'screen', 'height', 'talent.He', 'was', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'operatic', 'tenors', 'world', 'yet', 'seen', 'talented', 'highly', 'trained', 'voice', 'delivered', 'signature', 'performances', 'many', 'arias', 'most', 'popular', 'work', 'prominently', 'displayed', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'fan', 'music.But', 'here', 'bad', 'news', 'DVD', '*', 'picture', 'just', 'adequate', 'TV', 'antennae', 'broadcast', 'VHS', 'tape', 'quality', ""n't"", 'sharp', 'film', 'damage', 'artifacts', 'are', 'frequent', '*', 'sound', 'mono', 'pretty', 'bad', 'mistake', 'make', 'film', 'music', 'film', 'originally', 'had', 'nice', 'Dolby', 'soundtrack', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'reproduced', 'DVD.Here', 'good', 'news', '*', 'DVD', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'VERY', 'long', 'time', 'often', 'movies', 'did', 'poorly', 'box', 'office', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'release', 'all.Luckily', 'receiver', 'will', 'upscale', 'mono', 'track', 'simulate', 'stereo', ""'re"", 'not', 'badly', 'viewers', 'might', 'be.If', 'film', 'Pavarotti', 'least', 'can', 'get', 'now', 'three', 'stars', 'deduct', 'one', 'complete', 'lack', 'attention', 'film', 'quality', 'putting', 'out', 'mono', 'soundtrack.I', 'got', 'wife', 'Christmas', 'totally', 'happy', 'Recommended', 'above', 'caveats']",N/A

Shot in 1982, in the prime of his career, he plays Georgio Fini, who is exactly the same as Pavorotti, but MORE.

He gets to have an affair with a beautiful woman.  The wife?  She doesn't have to get involved in his ""private life"".  He sings an aria at the Met and there's an instant standing ovation (in the middle of the opera).  Trust me, this does not happen.  But we don't care, it's all in fun.  And the singing is glorious.  Pavarotti's voice is smooth and powerful, with huge breath control.  When he sings Nessun Dorma, he holds the last note forEVER!  We also get some wonderful singing from Leona Mitchell as Turandot, also in the prime of her career.  We have sumptuous scenery, lots of food, lots of music, and oh yes, there's actually a plot.
