113907,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790743949,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Frank Capra directed this black comedy that was adapted from the very popular 1940's Broadway production.  The release delayed for three years (the clause was that the film was not allowed to be released until after the play was finished its run), the film is largely considered to be one of the greats of the 1940's and is remembered as one of Cary Grant's finest films.  This is ironic, considering that he was very vocal about hating his performance (he felt it was too over the top) and considered this to be his worst film.Oh Cary; you were far too hard on yourself.`Arsenic and Old Lace' tells the story of Mortimer Brewster, a dramatic critic who detests the idea of marriage only to find himself in love with his aunts' darling neighbor.  Swept off his feet, and fighting his better judgment, he marries the girl.  His world is spun upside down though, when he ventures home to tell his aunts of his decision only to find out that they have a very dark secret; they have been killing off lonely only men.  Mercy killings, and all out of the kindness of their hearts, but murder is murder and Mortimer is beside himself with panic.  As the film progresses, a series of events and introduction of characters threaten to reveal the secret and spoil Mortimer's plans for a new life.Far from being merely hilarious, `Arsenic and Old Lace' scores big by being able to juggle the humor with genuine fright.  In fact, some of the sequences (like that `lights out' body switch) call to mind the clever handed direction of Alfred Hitchcock.Grant, Lane, Carson, Alexander and Hull are marvelous here, and Lorre and Massey surprise with some shades of character I wasn't expecting.  The film could be criticized for being slightly uneven, tonally, but at the end of the day, Capra knew what he was doing here, and what he does is create something that has its own identity and doesn't rely on stereotypes to deliver the goods.  No, `Arsenic and Old Lace' is a ravishing good time and earns the reputation it has with the cinematic world.",5,A scary good time!,1384214400,"11 12, 2013",2013,2033,"['Frank', 'Capra', 'directed', 'black', 'comedy', 'was', 'adapted', 'very', 'popular', '1940', 'Broadway', 'production', 'release', 'delayed', 'three', 'years', 'clause', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'be', 'released', 'play', 'was', 'finished', 'run', 'film', 'largely', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'greats', '1940', 'remembered', 'one', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'finest', 'films', 'ironic', 'considering', 'was', 'very', 'vocal', 'hating', 'performance', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'top', 'considered', 'be', 'worst', 'film.Oh', 'Cary', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'hard', 'yourself.', 'Arsenic', 'Old', 'Lace', 'story', 'Mortimer', 'Brewster', 'dramatic', 'critic', 'who', 'idea', 'marriage', 'only', 'find', 'love', 'aunts', 'darling', 'neighbor', 'Swept', 'off', 'feet', 'fighting', 'better', 'judgment', 'girl', 'world', 'spun', 'upside', 'down', 'though', 'when', 'ventures', 'home', 'tell', 'aunts', 'decision', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'have', 'very', 'dark', 'secret', 'have', 'been', 'killing', 'off', 'lonely', 'only', 'men', 'Mercy', 'killings', 'kindness', 'hearts', 'murder', 'murder', 'Mortimer', 'beside', 'panic', 'film', 'series', 'events', 'introduction', 'characters', 'threaten', 'reveal', 'secret', 'spoil', 'Mortimer', 'plans', 'new', 'life.Far', 'being', 'merely', 'hilarious', 'Arsenic', 'Old', 'Lace', 'scores', 'big', 'being', 'able', 'juggle', 'humor', 'genuine', 'fright', 'fact', 'sequences', 'lights', 'out', 'body', 'switch', 'call', 'mind', 'clever', 'handed', 'direction', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock.Grant', 'Lane', 'Carson', 'Alexander', 'Hull', 'are', 'marvelous', 'here', 'Lorre', 'Massey', 'surprise', 'shades', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'criticized', 'being', 'slightly', 'uneven', 'tonally', 'end', 'day', 'Capra', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'here', 'what', 'create', 'something', 'own', 'identity', ""n't"", 'rely', 'stereotypes', 'deliver', 'goods', 'No', 'Arsenic', 'Old', 'Lace', 'ravishing', 'good', 'time', 'reputation', 'cinematic', 'world']",N/A

113909,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,0790743949,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","The Broadway production of Joseph Kesselring's ARSENIC AND OLD LACE ran from 1/10/41 to 6/17/44, a total of 1,444 performances. WARNER's adaptation of the play was shot late in '41 but by contract couldn't be released until the show's run ended. Boris Karloff appeared onstage as Mortimer's evil brother, Jonathan. (Eric Von Stroheim also portrayed Jonathan in later shows.) Raymond Massey's film makeup so resembled Karloff the similarity became a running gag in the movie. Josephine Hull, Jean Adair and John Alexander reprised their stage roles for this motion picture.SYNOPSIS--When newly-married Mortimer Brewster learns that his two maiden aunts have poisoned 12 old men, room renters in their stately Brooklyn home, he fears he's as crazy as they and his uncle are. Pince nez-wearing Teddy Brewster, who imagines he's the first Pres. Roosevelt, blasts his bugle at all hours while charging a San Juan Hill parlor staircase. Abby and Martha Brewster long ago convinced Teddy that recently deceased ""gentlemen"" are Panama Canal typhoid victims in need of immediate burial in a basement ""lock,"" so their younger brother is often busy digging away down there.The sisters' most recent dead boarder reposes peacefully inside a window seat, awaiting a service and Central American interment, when Mortimer's long-missing brother resurfaces with a monstrous new face and a plastic surgeon in tow. Viciously homicidal Jonathan Brewster has left behind nearly a dozen bodies in his world travels; his latest corpse is just out in the car. Now Jonathan wants to kill a despised younger brother, but Mortimer is so distracted while trying to get Teddy committed to Happydale Rest Home, he's unaware of both impending fratricide and that his neglected new wife, Elaine is ready to sue for divorce even before their wedding night begins.Frank Capra's version of this fine comedy crackles with wit and is often loud and frantic.

A great blend of crime mixed with comedy mixed with suspense.  Cary Grant is excellent as Mortimer and the supporting cast of Raymond Massey and the always reliable Peter Lorre are excellent.  The two Brewster sisters work quite well off one another as well as the rest of the cast and Priscilla Lane is very sweet as the new Mrs. Brewster.  Lots of twists and turns and cooky characters make this a must see for any movie buff.  The opening sequence of explaining time and place is punctuated by ""Now You're On Your Own.""  I wish they did this more often in movies since while some may say it breaks the mood and draws us back to reality, we have to remember.  This is a fictional story.  They place this right at the beginning like any good story teller would do.  Very much like Hitchcock did in his later films where his cameos all appeared at the beginning of the film before the audience had become engrossed in the story.  Lots of goofiness from Cary Grant.

Cary Grant was the master of the romantic comedy of his day, and this film was part of that fantastic 1940s part of that genre.Grant plays Mortimer Brewster, a high class drama critic and one of the most eligible bachelors in NYC.  He grew up in Brooklyn, raised by his sweet aunts.  He meets Elaine in Brooklyn - she is the beautiful girl next door, the daughter of the local minister who lives across the way.  Anyway, he arrives at his aunts' house to tell them the good news about he and Elaine, but little does he know that they have a secret.  They sweetly and with great kindness help lonely single men who have no family.  They advertise a room to rent, but when the a lonely gentleman arrives he is treated to a glass of elderberry wine - laced with poison.  Yikes!The situation gets progressively more bizarre and twisted when Mortimer's sadistic brother (Raymond Massey) and his side kick (Peter Lorre) turn up with a body of their own to dispose of...all while another relation who believes himself to be Teddy Roosevelt charges up the stairs ""San Juan Hill"" blowing a trumpet as he goes, and taking occasional trips to the basement to ""Panama to visit the digging of the locks for the Panama Canal.""As things progress Grant becomes increasingly frantic as he realizes that ALL of his relations are crazy, that it may be just a matter of time for him.  How could he put Elaine through all of that?Grant hams and poses, but who can blame him!?  This is a film for that, and he's the man for the job!This is a must-watch film, especially for fans of the old black and white era of film.

The movie opens as Mortimer Brewster (Grant) and the lovely girl next door (Priscilla Lane) are standing in line at the marriage license bureau. Problem is, Brewster has written more than one book strongly against marriage as an institution, so he's got on dark glasses and is trying to avoid the press. You guessed it: he fails.He fails at just about everything he tries to do throughout this movie, except that in the end, his wife and he are indeed on their way to their honeymoon at Niagara Falls. It's all the stuff in between that will have you laughing so hard you may find it hard to breath.Mortimer's two maiden aunts, played by Josephine Hull and Jean Adair, have what we might call a Kevorkian Complex. They have a sign outside about a room to rent, and when lonely old men with no family and no hope come to rent the room, they give them a sip of elderberry wine laced with . . . well, you get it from the title, no doubt.Mortimer has two brothers. One is chubby and believes he is Theodore Roosevelt. When the aunts need a body buried, they tell him to go down in the basement and dig another lock for the Panama canal. Then they bury a ""yellow fever victim"" in it.The other brother (Raymond Massey) looks like Boris Karloff, and has his fake doctor accomplice with him, played by Peter Lorre. Massey has been on a killing spree, and when he and his aunts start comparing body count, he finds he needs one more to top them. Mortimer is his selection.There are cops and mental hospital directors and cab drivers and Mortimer's bewildered new wife all over the place, and the result is total chaos and more laughs than you can imagine.

Dispensing with most of his usual sentimentality, this movie is a pure dark comic romp about murder and insanity.  It still is a great family movie and portrays an old-fashioned love of &quot;small-town values&quot; (in quotes because I grew up in a small town and know better), and the jokes aren't dependent upon references to sex or bodily functions.  And unlike modern dark comedies, there isn't a single bit of gore. It is refreshing to watch a tightly plotted comedy where the situation itself is funny.The basic premise is that Cary Grant is an author famous for writing books denouncing the institution of marriage who has just gotten married and is now introducing his new bride to his family.  We soon learn, however, that the reason why he was originally against marriage is that insanity runs deeply in his family and he is afraid of passing it on to a new generation.  Much of the rest of the movie involves him trying to conceal this insanity from his new wife and the authorities, and to avoid having himself or anyone else killed in the process.  It starts out a bit slow, but once the premise is set up, the pacing is absolutely relentless, and you'll be rolling around in your seat and crying with laughter until the end.

Adapted from the hit Broadway show by Joseph Kesselring the film stars Cary Grant as Mortimer Brewster who discovers that his kindly old aunts, Abby and Martha (Josephine Hull and Jean Adair), are killing lonely old men to put them out of their misery. Along the way we meet the rest of Brewster's looney family including a sociopathic brother Jonathan (Raymond Massey) who bears a striking resemblence to Boris Karloff and another brother who thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt.The film is full of slapstick comedy and sight gags, Grant, normally an atheletic actor does his best to keep the comedy alive with his plastic facial expressions and pratfalls.This is a highly recommended film to just have fun with. The jokes never seem dated but the material has a tendency to lean toward overacting. In Capra's world this was not a bad thing.The disc, while low in price, is a barebones affair.

The story of Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant), the youngest of three brothers who were raised by two dear, but eccentric, spinster aunts, who have a nasty little habit of ""putting poor souls"" out of their misery with a little arsenic-laced elderberry wine.It is delightful to watch Mortimer go from a nice, normal, newlywed to a nervous, neurotic mess as he tries to figure a way out of the predicament his well-meaning aunts have placed them all in. Throw in one brother who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt, another who is a psychopathic killer fashioned after Boris Karloff, and Peter Lorre as Dr. Einstein, a slightly intoxicated make-shift plastic surgeon, and you'll be laughing the entire way through.All of the performances were wonderful, but Cary Grant's facial expressions, double takes, and hilarious body language are a joy to watch.

Even the supporting actors performed wonderfully-Peter Lorre, as the doctor, ""stole"" the show, according to some critics.  (Not that I necessarily agree.)  Grant is hilarious.The movie opens with a couple at a marriage license office.  Two newspaper reporters (one the 100 year old guy from I Love Lucy) notice that the man seems to be Mortimer Bruster, a well known bachelor who has written extensively on the follies of marriage.  As the story moves on, we get to know his two elderly aunts (who were simply awesome as actresses) and his two brothers, along with several family secrets.Interestingly, the movie is based on a Broadway play.  The two actresses who played the elderly aunts and the guy who played Teddy were from the play.  Boris Karloff actually played the brother Jonathan in the play.  Capra wanted Karloff for the movie, but because the play was still running, the producers wouldn't let him have Karloff because they felt he was the main attraction.And, while the movie was filmed in 1941, it wasn't released until 1944 (1943 for military audiences), because the agreement was to not release the movie until the play stopped going.All in all a five star comedy with just the right amount of dash of romance.",5,"""I'm the son of a sea cook!""",1141257600,"03 2, 2006",2006,1488,"['movie', 'directed', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'starring', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Priscilla', 'Lane', 'riot', 'littered', 'hilarious', 'black', 'comedy', 'ironic', 'words', 'acting', 'casting', 'are', 'superb.The', 'dialogue', 'wonderful', 'mind-blowing', 'story', 'well', 'done', 'Even', 'supporting', 'actors', 'performed', 'wonderfully-Peter', 'Lorre', 'doctor', 'stole', 'show', 'according', 'critics', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'agree', 'Grant', 'hilarious.The', 'movie', 'couple', 'marriage', 'license', 'office', 'Two', 'newspaper', 'reporters', 'one', '100', 'year', 'old', 'guy', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'notice', 'man', 'be', 'Mortimer', 'Bruster', 'well', 'known', 'bachelor', 'who', 'written', 'extensively', 'follies', 'marriage', 'story', 'moves', 'get', 'know', 'two', 'elderly', 'aunts', 'who', 'were', 'simply', 'awesome', 'actresses', 'two', 'brothers', 'several', 'family', 'secrets.Interestingly', 'movie', 'based', 'Broadway', 'play', 'two', 'actresses', 'who', 'played', 'elderly', 'aunts', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Teddy', 'were', 'play', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'actually', 'played', 'brother', 'Jonathan', 'play', 'Capra', 'wanted', 'Karloff', 'movie', 'play', 'was', 'still', 'running', 'producers', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'have', 'Karloff', 'felt', 'was', 'main', 'attraction.And', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', '1941', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', '1944', '1943', 'military', 'audiences', 'agreement', 'was', 'not', 'release', 'movie', 'play', 'stopped', 'going.All', 'five', 'star', 'comedy', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'dash', 'romance']",N/A

This was director Frank Capra's last film before he enlisted for duty after Pearl Harbor.Set on Halloween night, the movie parodies various Hollywood horror films of the previous decade as it tells the story of the eccentic and deadly Brewster family. Ironically, horror icon Boris Karloff was committed to the stage version and was unavailable to reprise his role of Jonathan Brewster for the film.The talent pool assembled for the film is astounding. Besides three-time Oscar winner Capra, Julius and Philip Epstein (Oscar winners for ""Casablanca"") adapted the screenplay for an all-star cast of Cary Grant (already nominated for ""None But the Lonely Heart"" that year), Josephine Hull (an Oscar winner in 1950 for another screwball comedy movie based on a play, ""Harvey""), Raymond Massey (who inherited the Karloff role) and Peter Lorrie among other performers.The acting is way over the top and that is part of its charms. ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" is so fast-paced with its one-liners, sight gags and outrageous situations that the two hours fly by.

113946,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,0790743949,C. O. DeRiemer,"[0, 1]","Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) has a problem. He's a newspaper critic known for his complaints about marriage, who just got married. Before the news breaks he wants to tell his two nice, elderly aunts, but when he arrives at their home he discovers the aunts have a combination hobby and charity. They poison lonely old men, then have them buried in their basement by their addled brother who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt. ""Teddy"" is concerned about all those yellow fever deaths, but digging the locks for the canal provides a logical burial place. When Mortimer discovers his aunts' 13th work of charity in a window seat, his troubles are just beginning. Showing up unexpectedly is Mortimer's criminal brother, Jonathan (Raymond Massey), an escaped psycho who, thanks to the botched facial surgery of his partner, Dr. Einstein (Peter Lorre), now resembles Boris Karloff. And wandering in and out are some great character actors, including Jack Carson as a play-writing cop, James Gleason as a police superintendent, Edward Everett Horton as the head of a home for the insane, and Grant Withers as a bemused clergyman.What could not be funny with such a setup and with such actors? Well...Cary Grant, in my view, nearly does the movie in. Grant (or Frank Capra) seems to think playing farce means squatting and walking like a chimpanzee, talking as loudly and fast as possible, and mugging broadly for the camera at every opportunity. There are many good things in this movie, but, for me, Grant overacts, something he rarely did in his other films. I suppose the blame rests with Capra.Hull, Adair and John Alexander who plays Teddy originated their parts in the stage presentation. One of the funny conceits was that playing Jonathan on Broadway actually was Boris Karloff. I've been told that when the movie was filmed the stage play was still doing good business. The producers let the three take six weeks to make the movie, but wouldn't release Karloff. They thought he was too important for ticket sales. It's too bad. As good as Raymond Massey is in the role (he shows a real flair for deadpan humor), having the real Karloff become enraged because his surgeon botched the operation and made him look like Karloff would have been unusually funny.",4,A Funny Premise But A Flawed Execution (Pun Intended),1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,2254,"['Mortimer', 'Brewster', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'problem', 'newspaper', 'critic', 'known', 'complaints', 'marriage', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'married', 'news', 'tell', 'two', 'nice', 'elderly', 'aunts', 'when', 'home', 'aunts', 'have', 'combination', 'hobby', 'charity', 'poison', 'lonely', 'old', 'men', 'then', 'have', 'buried', 'basement', 'addled', 'brother', 'who', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'Teddy', 'concerned', 'yellow', 'fever', 'deaths', 'digging', 'locks', 'canal', 'logical', 'burial', 'place', 'When', 'Mortimer', 'aunts', '13th', 'work', 'charity', 'window', 'seat', 'troubles', 'are', 'just', 'beginning', 'Showing', 'up', 'unexpectedly', 'Mortimer', 'criminal', 'brother', 'Jonathan', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'escaped', 'psycho', 'who', 'thanks', 'botched', 'facial', 'surgery', 'partner', 'Dr.', 'Einstein', 'Peter', 'Lorre', 'now', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'wandering', 'out', 'are', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'including', 'Jack', 'Carson', 'play-writing', 'cop', 'James', 'Gleason', 'police', 'superintendent', 'Edward', 'Everett', 'Horton', 'head', 'home', 'insane', 'Grant', 'Withers', 'bemused', 'clergyman.What', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'funny', 'setup', 'such', 'actors', 'Well', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'view', 'nearly', 'movie', 'Grant', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'think', 'playing', 'farce', 'squatting', 'walking', 'chimpanzee', 'talking', 'loudly', 'fast', 'possible', 'mugging', 'broadly', 'camera', 'opportunity', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'Grant', 'something', 'rarely', 'did', 'other', 'films', 'suppose', 'blame', 'Capra.Hull', 'Adair', 'John', 'Alexander', 'who', 'Teddy', 'originated', 'parts', 'stage', 'presentation', 'One', 'funny', 'conceits', 'was', 'playing', 'Jonathan', 'Broadway', 'actually', 'was', 'Boris', 'Karloff', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'stage', 'play', 'was', 'still', 'doing', 'good', 'business', 'producers', 'let', 'three', 'take', 'six', 'weeks', 'make', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'release', 'Karloff', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'important', 'ticket', 'sales', 'too', 'bad', 'As', 'good', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'role', 'real', 'flair', 'deadpan', 'humor', 'having', 'real', 'Karloff', 'become', 'enraged', 'surgeon', 'botched', 'operation', 'made', 'look', 'Karloff', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unusually', 'funny']",N/A

I have grown up watching this movie and laughing. After I bought this from Amazon and wathed it, I realized something that I have never noticed before. This movie was directed by Frank Capra, the same man who made arguably the best Christmas movie ever made,It's a Wonderful Life [Blu-ray].This movie is about the consumet bachelor, Mortimer Brewster, played by Cary Grant, who is getting married. He and his new bride decide to stop by their homes, which happen to be next door to each other, before going on a honeymoon. When Cary Grant gets to his home he finds out that his elderly aunts who raised him and take care of his crazy brother, who thinks he is Theodore Roosevelt, are murderers. They have a habit of taking in elderly men with no family and poisoning them and buring them in the cellar. There is also another brother, Jonathan, who stops by bringing a friend and a dead body of his own.Take all these elements and through them into the pot, along with a pair of cops that visit frequently to get the mixture only Frank Capra could bring to the screen. I thas plenty of laughs and even some light hearted tension. Sixty-six years old and the movie still holds up.

Levine,"[4, 5]","If you think that Frank Capra only did heartwarming, gentle comedies, such as ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" you have to see this wild, dark comedy that would do justice to any zany spoofs promulgated on ""Saturday Night Live."" Actually, the original stage production was supposed to have been a drama but, when the audience laughed, it was changed and became one of the great comedies of all time. The movie features two sweet, elderly ladies, palyed by Josephine Hull and Jean Adair, who save lonely old men from their misery by poisoning them. Their nephew Mortimer, played by Cary Grant, discovers their strange pastime, and the wild hijinx begins.Mortimer has two brothers, Teddy, who believes that he is Theodore Roosevelt, and Jonathan (creepily played by the great Raymond Massey), a homicidal maniac who looks like Boris Karloff due to botched plastic surgery. Truthfully, the whole family is nuts, except for Mortimer, and Mortimer is trying to get Teddy committed while, at the same time trying to deal with his discovery about his aunts' homicidal activities. Of course, Teddy becomes an unwitting accomplice as he buries the bodies in the basement, having been led to believe that they are yellow fever victims. After all, he IS Theodore Roosevelt, and he has to supervise the digging of the Panama Canal, Panama being located in the basement.Mortimer has more worries. He has to somehow get his recent bride out of the house (he was married earlier that day). He can't allow her to know what is going on after his discovery of his aunts' homicides. Meanwhile, criminally insane Jonathan arrives on the scene, having escaped from prison and with his reluctant sidekick, Dr. Einstein, played by Peter Lorre, he prepares to do Mortimer in. Crazy events happen in rapid sequence but, despite the fact that this is a comedy, it is also a thriller that had me sitting at the edge of my seat.

Thinking that his crazy brother, who believes he's President Teddy Roosevelt, murdered the man, Mortimer tells his aunts about his discovery and that he thinks Teddy should be put in a sanitarium immediately. But Martha and Abby aren't shocked about the dead body at all. In fact, they are the ones who killed him and the eleven other men in the cellar! Of course, they don't think what they do is murder -- they think they're doing a charity for lonely, old men by poisoning them with elderberry wine with arsenic in it and giving them a proper burial in their cellar. Stunned that his aunts could do such a thing and not think it's wrong, Mortimer goes on a quest to get Martha, Abby and Teddy all put away at the Happydale Sanitarium.

Although he is famous for his books praising bachelorhood, he has just married Elaine Harper. But when he goes to tell his two elderly aunts the news, he discovers that his ""sweet"" aunts have been murdering elderly men by serving them elderberry wine laced with poison. His cousin Teddy, who thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt, has been burying the bodies, which he thinks belong to victims of yellow fever, in the basement, where he thinks he is digging locks for the Panama Canal. And as if that wasn't enough, Mortimer's brother Jonathan shows up at the house looking for a place to bury his latest murder victim.Arsenic and Old Lace is a wickedly funny screwball comedy. The script is witty and there are lots of sight gags. Funny scenes include Mortimer's discovery of one of his aunt's victims; the cab driver waiting patiently for Mortimer while stopping another cab to give someone a ride; many people almost drinking the poisoned wine; and policemen coming in and out of the house without a clue of the murderous happenings going on around them.The actors nail their parts. Josephine Hull and Jean Adair are great as the seemingly sweet, slightly befuddled aunts. John Alexander is perfect as Teddy. Peter Lorre is funny as Dr. Einstein, Jonathan's assistant and Raymond Massey is appropriately chilling as Jonathan.

All of the humour felt to me like it was being shoved down my throat; there is NO subtlety at all, no &quot;throwaway gags&quot; or quiet humour.  No, quite the contrary; the male characters all speak in an extremely grating chattering nasal voice with all the likeness of a 40s radio newscaster; no emotion or feeling in their voices, just words, words, words and more words.  The grandmothers are not much better; their part in the &quot;humour&quot; is to explain something that is meant to be funny over and over again, slowly, until the audience has it ingrained in their minds.Another example of the &quot;humour&quot; is an insane family member running up the stairs while yelling &quot;CHARGE!!!&quot; loud enough to wake your neighbour. This is repeated 10+ times. Do you find that funny? If you do, then you may like this movie.  I, on the other hand, just found it stupid.All of the characters were so unbelievable, the acting and humour so bad and childish, that I turned it off before I even finished watching it (at the point where the grandmothers discovered the crooks).Maybe I had to be alive in the 40s to &quot;get it&quot;.

Originally filmed in 1941 just prior to WWII, but not released until 1944 because of the contract agreement to allow the play to complete its Broadway run.  (The play ran for 1,444 performances.)Cary Grant in the leading role as nephew, Mortimer Brewster is at his comedic best in this black comedy of wine, family &amp; insanity.  His 2 fabulous Aunts played by Josephine Hull &amp; Jean Adair were encored to the screen and are perfect in their roles.  Boris Karloff's obligations prevented him from doing the movie and was replaced by Raymond Massey in the movie version as Grant madcap brother.  The great ensemble cast also included Peter Lorre, Edward Everett Horton, Priscilla Lane &amp; John Alexander as a delightful zany crazy, thinking he is President &quot;Teddy Roosevelt&quot;.Summary:  It is Halloween, Mortimers wedding day &amp; his life is about to change forever. Visiting his 2 Aunts (Hull &amp; Adair) with his wife (Lane - Ministers daughter!) on their way to their honeymoon to Niagara Falls discovers a body in the window seat.  Thinking his crazy cousin, (Alexander) has committed the crime approaches his Aunts.  They not only know about the body, but they know who he was &amp; how he died.  Their elderberry wine laced with a mixture of arsenic.  Oh by the way, he is the 12th to be buried in the cellar.  What is Mortimer to do &amp; is his entire family insane?

This film was adapted from a play and it shows in the setting and I had the impression that I was watching a play on film.  While this approach may work with many plays, somehow it just didn't quite make it for me in this instance.  Perhaps because it was filmed during World War II and so budgets were constrained, the film just looked extremely low budget to me with settings that looked little more than poor quality stage props to me.  The acting of some of the cast though such as the impeccable Peter Lorre was a joy to watch.  At almost 2 hours long though, I felt the film dragged on a little longer than was necessary and I actually got a little bored towards the end.  Most of the jokes don't age very well and would surely be lost on today's audiences.  Overall, a tiresome film that would probably have been a lot more enjoyable as a play on Broadway rather than as one transferred onto film.  While films adapted from plays have worked before, somehow it just didn't do it here.In addition the DVD picture and sound quality isn't the best and the sound especially could have come with Dolby Digital Surround options instead of just the mono here.

113983,A2BPDFR58H9575,0790743949,Galina,"[1, 2]","*** This comment may contain spoilers ***What a wonderful, funny, dark, and even macabre comedy Arsenic and Old Lace is. It runs fast, the situations are hilarious even if you are not supposed to be amused by the family with the history of insanity that not just runs.... ""It practically gallops"". The film which is based on the highly popular and successful play of the same title, takes place during one Halloween night that brings all Brewster's family skeletons out of the closet with the vengeance. During the course of one night, Mortimer Brewster, the famous writer and critic, will discover the shocking truth about his two most charming aunties, the nicest and sweetest ladies any nephew can imagine. They are two serial murderesses who had poisoned dozen of elderly lonely gentlemen with their famous elderberry wine out of pity for the misery of their loneliness. The aunties call the killings one of their charities. They see themselves as angels of mercy.Mortimer's escaped from prison psychotic long lost horrifying monster older brother Jonathan (he does have a face of Boris Karloff's Frankenstein) with a creepy accomplice plastic surgeon named Dr. Einstein (terrific Peter Lorre) chose the Halloween night for coming home and dragging a dead body with him. Comparing to the aunts and Johnathan, Mortimer's uncle Teddy is sweet and truly innocent. There is a little problem with Teddy though. He thinks he's Theodore Roosevelt; each time Teddy goes upstairs he blows a bugle, yells ""Charge!"", and takes the stairs at a run with a sword in his hand (an imitation of Roosevelt's famous charge up San Juan Hill). I read some comments that found Teddy's ascent that he repeats few times, irritating and annoying but I thought it was one of the funniest parts of the movie. Teddy is also digging 'The Panama Canal' in their cellar to bury the victims of ""yellow fever"" (or so Teddy is told by the aunties). Oh yes, on the top of all, Mortimer, who is known as a staunch bachelor and become famous for writing sarcastically about marriage in his articles and plays, just got married to a lovely young lady, the next door neighbor to his aunts in Brooklyn. His bride expects the attention that is only natural from the groom on the wedding night but...who would blame Mortimer of a little forgetfulness and absent-mildness when he is trying desperately to take care of the crazy relatives, two dead bodies in the living room, to avert the attention of bunch of cops that keep popping in from dozen of dead bodies buried in the cellar, and to survive his brother Jonathan's long lived hatred, very short temper, and passion to torture and to kill. I never thought that Cary Grant, the embodiment of a gentleman, romantic hero, and the man whom Jan Fleming had in mind when he created his immortal James Bond, could be so funny.

Taylor ""GFT""","[5, 5]","ARSENIC AND OLD LACE was one of the great stage comedies of the 1940s, and even today the script remains a staple of highschool, college, community theatre across the country.  The story is convoluted, to say the least: two elderly sisters reknowned for good deeds have taken to aiding lonely old men by offering them a glass of poisoned wine (one of their victims found time to say ""How delicious!""), and when their homocidal maniac nephew Jonathan unexpectedly returns after several years he feels compelled to keep pace with their body count.  Fortunately, there is a ready victim at hand: his brother Mortimer,who is apparently the only sane member of the family.Cary Grant is on record saying that he greatly disliked his work in this film, and in truth his entire performance consists of nothing but double and triple takes, stammerings, and fits of hysteria--but he executes them with impeccable timing and creates an acceptable foil for the truly memorable performances that run through the film: Raymond Massey as the homicidal Jonathan, Josephine Hull and Jean Adair as the lethal ladies, and memorable supporting performances from Peter Lorre, Edward Everette Horton, Jack Carson, John Alexander, and Priscilla Lane, all of whom play out the outrageous script with considerably dexterity, intelligence, and disconcerting humor.This is an extremely frantic, extremely broad farce, and director Frank Capra is not entirely at home with the material, which he presents in a somewhat stagey manner--but truth be told it is unlikely that any other director would be more successful.  ARSENIC AND OLD LACE is most at home on the stage; on the screen it has a tendency to become slightly overbearing, and some will find it too strident for their tastes.  But the script is wickedly funny, the complicated plot is fun to unravel, and the cast is extremely memorable.

The suave Grant stars as Mortimer Brewster, a renowned theater critic who despises marriage and Brooklyn. All of the action takes place, ironically, on Halloween, when Grant returns home to Brooklyn to inform his aunts that he has just tied the knot with next-door neighbor Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane) and will be leaving on his honeymoon in Niagara Falls.

About to pin the murder on his insane brother, Teddy (""Roosevelt""), he quickly finds out that his seemingly sane aunts are behind the killing -- as one of their numerous 'charity' acts. The rest of the movie is one comedic scene after the other as Grant comes to terms with his aunts' killing of lonely old men, his quest to get Teddy committed to the Happy Dale Sanitarium, and the reappearance of his long-lost brother, hit man Jonathan (Raymond Massey).With thirteen bodies, a jar of poisonous elderberry wine, and two policemen running about, this comedy will keep you laughing for hours.",5,Twisted but Funny,1036454400,"11 5, 2002",2002,1434,"['Two', 'old', 'ladies', 'who', 'poison', 'lonely', 'men', 'bury', 'basement', 'well', 'little', 'sickening', 'however', 'plot', 'one', 'greatest', 'comedies', 'time', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'Arsenic', 'Old', 'Lace', '.Cary', 'Grant', 'gave', 'great', 'performances', 'career', 'may', 'be', 'greatest', 'comedy', 'suave', 'Grant', 'stars', 'Mortimer', 'Brewster', 'renowned', 'theater', 'critic', 'who', 'marriage', 'Brooklyn', 'action', 'place', 'ironically', 'Halloween', 'when', 'Grant', 'home', 'Brooklyn', 'inform', 'aunts', 'just', 'tied', 'knot', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'Elaine', 'Harper', 'Priscilla', 'Lane', 'will', 'be', 'leaving', 'honeymoon', 'Niagara', 'Falls', 'looking', 'destroy', 'notes', 'latest', 'literary', 'work', 'Matrimony', 'accidentally', 'body', 'window-seat', 'aunts', 'living', 'room', 'pin', 'murder', 'insane', 'brother', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'quickly', 'out', 'seemingly', 'sane', 'aunts', 'are', 'killing', 'one', 'numerous', ""'charity"", 'acts', 'rest', 'movie', 'one', 'comedic', 'scene', 'other', 'Grant', 'terms', 'aunts', 'killing', 'lonely', 'old', 'men', 'quest', 'get', 'Teddy', 'committed', 'Happy', 'Dale', 'Sanitarium', 'reappearance', 'long-lost', 'brother', 'hit', 'man', 'Jonathan', 'Raymond', 'Massey', '.With', 'thirteen', 'bodies', 'jar', 'poisonous', 'elderberry', 'wine', 'two', 'policemen', 'running', 'about', 'comedy', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing', 'hours']",N/A

Not to mention an early ironic plot device that has Grant, as a famous author of marriage-hating books, fall in love and get married.

Cary Grant, Raymond Massey, Peter Lorre, Jack Carson, Priscilla Lane, Edward Everett Horton, Josephine Hull, Jean Adair, John Alexander, James Gleason, etc.  The great Frank Capra directs this film adaptation of a successful stage play.Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) is distracted from his wedding night when he gets caught up in the wild goings-on at his aunts' Brooklyn home.  He stumbles upon what he considers a dark secret and frantically tries to set things right amid the chaos of his looney family and a steady stream of unexpected guests.  Josephine Hull and Jean Adair play the kind-hearted aunts, reprising their stage roles.  John Alexander makes quite an impression as the delusional brother, who thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt.  Raymond Massey plays a Karloff look-alike, a criminal and the black sheep of the family.  Peter Lorre is his associate, Dr. Einstein.  Priscilla Lane plays Grant's frustrated bride.  Jack Carson is the new neighborhood cop (and an amateur playwright), and Edward Everett Horton shows up as the director of an insane asylum.The movie is a hoot all the way through, with a great script and a wacky bunch of characters.  The comedy is rather dark at times, dealing with dead bodies and the grey area between charity and serial murder.  The movie has a sort of Halloween feel to it, but can be enjoyed the whole year long.Be warned that the cover art of this2010 re-packaged DVDis very mis-leading.  It paints this film as a jolly romantic comedy, showing Cary Grant and Priscilla Lane gazing into each other's eyes, smiling, hand-in-hand.  The truth of the matter is that this is a wild comedy with a wild cast of characters and Priscilla Lane has very little screen time.  I much prefer the cover art of theolder DVD, which still shows Grant and Lane, but in a way that conveys the wackiness of the film.This 2010 re-issue is a no-frills DVD release.  The single disc has no printed artwork on it.  The DVD case is one of those cost-effective ones with the plastic cut out of the front and back covers.  There is no insert or booklet.  The disc itself includes the movie (the main attraction) and two text features: a list of the cast and crew and a brief ""Stage To Screen"" historical background.  (At this time I can neither confirm nor deny that this is the same disc included in the previous release.)ARSENIC AND OLD LACE is a great movie that should be enjoyed by most fans of classic (black & white) comedies and anyone else interested enough to give it a try.  The DVD is pretty skimpy, but it comes with the movie (which is the important part) and is relatively inexpensive.

He is about to take his bride to Niagara Falls and stops by home to get his things and let her get her own. (She's the girl next door). His two delightful aunts wish him well on his way but he finds a dead body hidden in the window seat. It turns out that his aunts have a bad habit of poisoning lonely old men to bring them peace. You would think that the bodies would pile up after a while but that's where Grant's brother comes in handy. His is crazy and thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt. The old dears just tell him that there has been another yellow fever victim and he heads down to Panama (the basement) to dig another lock (grave). These revelation are not what Grant needed to hear on his wedding day and he begins to scheme on how to conduct damage control.Things get more complicated when his long lost brother shows up. He is an escaped murderer and needs a place to hide. He also has an extra dead body to dispose of. Things get more and more complicated and Grant, the only sane member of the family, just about goes crazy trying to protect his aunts from his brother, everyone from the police and himself from everyone else.Raymond Massey plays the villain and is ably assisted by Peter Lorre as his assistant. Massey is a dark and brooding character right out of the horror films and Lorre is not really too bad deep down, only frightened. The aunts are a delight to watch.

Two old maid sisters poison a dozen homeless gents to save them from the vicissitudes of life. That's what one of them said in the stage play version of this story. That line was edited from the movie. With or without viscissitudes, see this movie. High school drama coaches may have decided not to stage it any longer. The humor exceeds great. It picked on poor Brooklyn, the butt-city of jokes from the late 1930s until the Dodgers moved to LA. Gleason, the police brass, tried to play it straight and was funnier for the effort. Jack Carson, cop-on-the-beat, is an hopelessly inept lawman. Cary Grant was superb. His family's insanity seemed rational compared to Grant's efforts to sort out the ding-bat antics of a nephew who makes endemic charges up the staircase as &quot;Roughrider President Teddy Roosevelt.&quot; Peter Lorre plays Doktor Einstein, plastic surgeon, as wicked as naughty boys who pull legs off crickets. And one of those &quot;boys&quot; is now adult &quot;short-quite-a-few-cards-in-the-deck&quot; Raymond Massey,who has matured into an  escaped psychotic-convict. Massey is predictably recognized as a monster due to the irregular stitches left on his face by Doktor Einstein. Someone has to keep this mirthful merry-go-round from spinning into outer wacky-space.

It stars two of the best in Cary Grant and Raymond Massey.  Priscilla Lane as Cary Grant's wife is cute and much put upon.  Then with Frank Capra directing, Max Steiner' music and lush photography by Sol Polito, the result is a very attractive to look at production.On the other hand, no matter how it is dressed up, the story is about a family of serial murderers.  The requirement for a suspension of critical review (the aunts are stone killers; the Raymond Massey character is a murderer and torturer; the Cary Grant character has been a torture victim) is too great for me.  Since none of the killers ever say or do anything that is funny (all those lines belong to other characters) watching this movie becomes an exercise in holding down the gag/revulsion reflex.If I were to look at the stylishness of the production it would rate 4 or 5 stars.  My policy is to try to accept a movie based upon its own premises.  However in this instance, the story is so unremittingly morally bankrupt, that to overlook this lack of principles is to not see the movie before you.

I had seen it many times when I was younger but the last time I had seen it was several years ago late at night on some satellite channel. When I first watched this dvd I realized that the version I had always seen on T.V. had been edited. The difference between the dvd and T.V. version were that the introductory screen credits to the movie was a Halloween cartoon and there were several other scenes that had been edited or deleted altogether. There were a few special features but nothing too exciting.I would have rated this movie as perfect except for the fact that it has outdated slapstick humor and of course it is only b&w; (black and white). I would have preferred for it to be available as both a b&w; and colorized version, but I suppose that the studio thought that the evil Boris Karloff look-alike, Johnathan Brewster, looked creepier in b&w.; The acting in this movie was great for the time period and included several famous actors including one of my favorite actors Peter Lorre, he  brilliantly portrays the fearful assistant to the disfigured and evil Johnathan Brewster.

The casting is inspired - Raymond Massey as the Boris Karloff lookalike, Jonathan, Peter Lorre as Dr. Einstein, and Cary Grant - just beyond perfect as Mortimer Brewster - the unseen Mr. Spinolzo, the ""hot stiff in the rumbleseat.""I've always loved Cary Grant in a drama or comedy, but honestly, he is so freaking funny in this movie that no one can compare in any other vehicle.Grant's conversation on the phone with the operator while he's trying to get the Happydale Sanitarium is priceless! (I often feel that same way when I'm on the phone with my HMO.) Meanwhile, Aunt Abby and Aunt Martha are trying to give some tainted elderberry wine to yet another unsuspecting old man they think is lonely and needs to be relieved of the burden of living.When Grant gets off the phone, he's so frustrated he pours himself a glass of wine - elderberry wine, and Aunt Martha gives him an ""uh uh UH!"" and he drops the glass. But the potential border cum victim is about ready to drink his down, and Grant SCREAMS and chases him out of the house with, ""Do you want to be poisoned? Do you want to be killed?"" and trips over a chair.Then there's the scene where he goes to the judge to get cousin Teddy (who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt) committed to Happydale. The judge is an old stiff himself, and he tells Mortimer, ""Tell Aunt Abby and Aunt Martha I'll be over. I've been a little lonely,"" to which Mortimer shouts, 'No, no! Don't ever tell them you're lonely! Tell me, Judge, are you a drinking man?""The judge says, ""Certainly not!"" but adds as a relieved Mortimer is leaving, ""Of course, a little wine now and then...."" Mortimer screams, ""Not wine! No wine! Don't drink wine!"" The judge then wonders, ""Maybe I committed the wrong Brewster.""Then there's the inimitable Jack Carson as the cop on the beat who is playwrite on the sly. His expressions are second only to Grant, particularly when he reacts to Teddy.Priscilla Lane is perfect as Mortimer's fiance, Elaine (a small part, but oh, she does it perfectly.)As you can tell, I've seen this movie so many times I've inadvertently memorized whole sections of dialogue.

114046,A32EEGACSPIPI0,0790743949,Kimberly,"[1, 1]","This is both one of my favorite Cary Grant and Frank Capra films and in my opinion it is  also one of the funniest movies in the history of cinema.There is an opinion among some that Grant's role as Mortimer Brewster was too over the top. In fact Cary Grant would agree with this opinion as he said Arsenic & Old Lace was one of his least favorite performances. Of course actors do not know everything and if I could speak to Cary Grant beyond the grave the one thing I would want to tell him is how much I loved his performance in this film. We all love the debonair & charming Cary Grant who was a master of light comedy but it is nice when we get something different from him and this is exactly what we get here. Instead of that charming & debonair leading man we get a man who is completely out of his element. He is surrounded by insane people but his reactions to the crazy situation he finds himself in make him come off the most insane. This creates some delicious irony which makes an amusing black comedy about sweet old ladies poisoning old men even more hilarious.The rest of the cast is also excellent with 3 of the actors (the two Brewster Sisters and Teddy Brewster) reprising their roles from the original Broadway play to appear in the movie. The only sour point is Frank Capra was not able to get Boris Karloff to reprise his role as Jonathan Brewster (instead this role was played by Raymond Massey). However to make up for the lack of Boris Karloff, Frank Capra brilliantly cast Peter Lorre as Doctor Einstein which might be the best casting decision of the movie.Although this movie is especially perfect to watch during Halloween with the mixture of humor and horror, it is great fun to watch anytime. It's the type of movie that even if you know what is going to happen it never gets old.

Mortimer Brewster is a New York theatre critic. He returns home to Brooklyn to announce the happy news, that he's marrying the girl next door, a minister's daughter.While receiving the good wishes of his two maiden aunts, Grant discovers a corpse hidden in the house. At first he believes that his crazy brother ""Teddy Roosevelt"" Brewster (who habitually charges up the stairs and sounds his trumpet at any given moment) is the culprit, but as he soon discovers, his dear old aunts are a pair of homicidal maniacs who are poisoning lonely little old men and burying them in the cellar as an act of charity.Just as he receives this news, his second crazy brother, Jonathan Brewster (Raymond Massey) who resembles Boris Karloff, arrives back at the house after escaping from a Home For The Criminally Insane in Indiana, pulling a quack Dr. Einstein (Peter Lorre) in tow.ARSENIC AND OLD LACE then becomes a frenetic laugh-a-minute comedy, as an increasingly frazzled Mortimer tries to evict the homicidal Jonathan, convince the doctor to commit the delusional Teddy, and protect his lovely killer aunts from the police (who keep coming to the door) even while everyone around him is singlemindedly pursuing their own agenda. Who can blame him if he forgets he's newly-engaged?This film is famous for its sight gags and endless one-liners, particularly Mortimer's thrilled sing-song at the end, when he discovers he's only an adopted Brewster: ""I'm the son of a sea-cook! I'm the son of a sea-cook!""Frank Capra made this film a faithful adaptation of the wildly successful stage play which ran from 1941-44.

In  some ways it might be called the original horror spoof: Two sweet old  ladies poison lonely old men as a &quot;charity&quot; and bury them in the  cellar, and no sooner does their stable nephew find out about this (while  preparing to leave for his honeymoon) than his long-lost homicidal brother  returns with a face like Frankenstein's monster.Cary Grant knew his way  around a comedy, so it's easy to believe when his character Mortimer grows  more and more frazzled throughout the night, jumping from one problem to  the next so quickly that he can't even remember he's just been married that  day. In his place, juggling four insane relatives (three of them killers),  a handful of cops, and two dead bodies, we'd all feel the worse for wear.  The pace is quick, almost frantic at times; complications and plot twists  come faster than anyone in the movie can handle them. The only characters  who aren't perturbed and thrown completely out of their elements by the  affair are the rest of the Brewster family, who are all crazy anyway.The  dark comedy genre is full of films that are a little too graphic or  disturbing for kids (and even some adults), but this one's not quite so  dark, and wildly funny enough to entertain all ages.

Grant was way off the mark on this one.There are some mild spoilers here, but I wouldn't think they'd damage your pleasure before you watched it.

Uncle Teddy is cookoo and thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt.  The aunts think he's the only one that's screwed up in the head, but, in fact, they are as well.  For they have been murdering lonely elderly gentlemen in their own home and burying them in the cellar.  When the nephew finds out, he goes a little weird himself in his attempt to figure out what to do about it.Everything gets worse when the long, lost, delinquent brother (Raymond Massey) returns home after a prison escape and is looking for a place to live and to bury his most recent victim.It's a plot that Hitchcock himself would have enjoyed, but there just wasn't clear direction of the acting and therefore no cohesiveness.

His brother Teddy (John Alexander) thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt and spends his time digging ""locks for the Panama Canal"" in the basement of the family home. His brother Jonathan (wonderfully played by Raymond Massey) has returned home with a dozen murders to his credit, looking like Frankenstein, thanks to the sinister plastic surgeon who accompanies him (Peter Lorre). His batty, elderly aunts (Jean Adair and Josephine Hull) put Teddy's ""locks"" to good use for their own ""merciful"" activities.The frantic action, ironies, and the dramatic surprises all center around two bodies, hidden at various times in the window seat of the living room, and the reactions to them by the various people within the household. The local police, friends of Aunts Abby and Martha, stop by to chat, have coffee, and protect these ""sweet"" old ladies, often at the worst possible moments, while Mortimer tries to decide what to do about his strange family and the bodies in the house. Complicating the action is the fact that Mortimer has just that day married Elaine (Priscilla Lane), who lives next door. She keeps showing up at the house at the wrong moment, having no idea why Mortimer keeps kicking her out.Sight gags, mistaken identity, contretemps, high-speed action, and split second timing make this one of the most outrageous, and hilarious black comedies ever filmed. The cast is perfect, and the acting is over-the-top, with a great deal of yelling, mugging, wide-eyed looks of surprise, feigned innocence, and even satire of the film industry as people repeatedly tell Jonathan he looks like Boris Karloff. Perfectly timed entrances and exits keep the action moving at a frantic pace, and the conclusion is delightful. Released in 1944, when World War II had taken a terrible toll on the country emotionally, the film must have provided a much-needed comic lift at a time when it was especially needed.

Abby and Martha Brewster, also known as the Barbaric Brewster Sisters, are armed with tasty elderberry wine laced with arsenic, and are extremely dangerous.Sound like an April Fool's joke?  The deadly killers who appear to be gentle old ladies are two of the stars of &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace,&quot; a film based on the classic slapstick mystery-comedy play by Joseph Kesselring.The story revolves around Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant), a drama critic who has just eloped with the lovely Elaine Harper, who happens to live next door to Mortimer's kind but eccentric spinster aunts.  However, Mortimer is forced to put his marriage celebration on hold when he discovers his aunts' dirty little secret: they've been putting lonely old men out of their misery by killing them and moving them, PERMANENTLY, into the cellar.  Add to that Mortimer's crazed brother Jonathan (who was modeled after Boris Karloff) and his shady assistant (played by Peter Lorre), as well as Mortimer's other brother, Teddy, who can't let go of the notion that he is President Theodore Roosevelt, and you have all the makings for the quintessential slapstick comedy.&quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; makes no attempt to be serious, and everyone who watches it will be delighted with it.  Cary Grant gives what was probably the performance of his career, transforming from a happy newlywed to a neurotic mess as he desperately tries to figure out a way to get his aunts off the hook.

I don't recall his reasons, but I do remember that he suddenly got very irritable and told me how much he hated the picture.Despite what Cary Grant might have thought, most people think that this adaptation of Joseph Kesselring's hit Broadway play is one of the funniest films ever made.Directed by Frank Capra, the farcical plot tells of the oddball Brewster family of Brooklyn.  The only sane member of the clan is Grant, a drama critic, but he's quickly being driven mad by one brother (John Alexander), who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt, a homicidal brother (Raymond Massey), who looks like Boris Karloff, and a pair of dotty old aunts (Josephine Hull, Jean Adair), whose favorite pastime is poisoning lonely old men.  Currently, there's an even dozen buried in their basement.Aside from Priscilla Lane, who plays Grant's confused new bride, the choice cast also includes Peter Lorre as a doctor with dubious credentials, Jack Carson as the neighborhood cop, James Gleason as his flustered boss and Edward Everett Horton as the head of the Happy Dale Sanitarium.BTW: In this film, Grant does what is possibly the funniest double-take in movie history.

It featured eccentric characters engaged in daffy behavior and caught in an intricate, farcial plot. In these plays, the whole world is shown to be crazy, and often - as in ARSENIC AND OLD LACE - the plot centers around a clinically insane person (ie. Teddy) who comes off at play's end looking like the sanest of the bunch. ARSENIC AND OLD LACE is one of the most hilarious examples of the screwball comedy, as well as an excellent send-up of the horror movies and melodramas of the time; its comic treatment of torture and murder must have indeed seemed cathartic during World War II, when the film was made.

114084,A27PSZX2SE0B51,0790743949,Mike Stone,"[2, 2]","The hype on the movie is that it is a screwball/black comedy. Those elements are certainly here, only not in the supply that the hype would have you believe. Rather, it is a goofy comedy tempered by some serious suspense elements. Scratch that; maybe it's a dark and twisted thriller, with some light comedic touches thrown in. An easier question: Is a zebra white with black stripes or black with white stripes?The movie's first third concentrates on introducing the characters, comprised mainly of the eerily insane Brewster family. Spinster Aunts Abby and Martha live in a big old house with their nephew Teddy; he thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt (&quot;Charge!&quot; he yells, as he leads an imaginary brigade of Rough Riders up the staircase). Mortimer Brewster, respected critic (of both theatrical drama and marriage) is about to tie the knot with next door neighbour Elaine. So far so good. Nothing more than your average wacky film family. But Abby and Martha are hiding a secret. Well, it's not really a secret, and they're not trying to hide it at all. Mortimer finds out that they've been luring lonely old men to their house, in the guise of renting a room, only too euthanatize them with poisoned elderberry wine. Things pretty much get weird from there.All of this weirdness allows Cary Grant (Mortimer) to slowly dip into incredulous mania. I usually prefer Grant when his hair is slick and in place and his suit is pressed and neat. Here, his hair flops all over the place, his suit gets wrinkled and dirty, he emits frantic yelps, his eyes bug out with double-takes, his arms flail, and he does funny dances. Grant, the epitome of suave and sophisticated, proves that he plays mania quite well. It's an over-the-top but still entertaining performance.The supporting cast are little more than a collection of devices masquerading as characters. Raymond Massey, Josephine Hull, Jean Adair, and John Alexander all do yeomen's work depicting slightly insane characters, but it's never anything to write home about. Basically, they do fine jobs giving Grant excuses to muss his hair. Even Peter Lorre -- an infinitely interesting actor to watch -- gets only a few juicy moments to strut his stuff. My favourite, him standing in front of a police officer who is on the phone reciting a description of a wanted suspect (&quot;About 5'3&quot;, 140 lbs., popped-out eyes, speaks in a German accent...&quot;), cringing as the description fits him perfectly, relieved when the officer fails to notice this fact too.Director Frank Capra does well shifting the film's tone more violently than any movie I can remember. One minute he's piling on the gags, the next he's setting a scene in pitch darkness except for tiny bits of revelatory light, as the audience wonders where the dead body is going to turn up next. And the story, which is essentially told in real time (we see the night sky intrude slowly upon the narrative), moves along at a brisk enough pace. However, I would have liked to see him take the action out of its one-location setting. When the play was on the stage, this makes sense. But a film is dynamic, it can move from setting to setting. There's a perfectly good cemetery next to the house. Why not set a scene or two there, and free up the action? Just a thought.&quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; was a little darker and more suspenseful than I expected. Not that it wasn't a welcome surprise, mind you. Sometimes confounded expectations work in a movie's favour. This time, it did. An enjoyable flick, no matter what colour zebra it really is.",4,Grant+Capra=Serial Killer Comedy!?!

All this and much more makes up the insane horror comedy based on a stage play that goes by the name ""Arsenic and Old Lace.""Have you ever you had something interfere and keep you from doing something that you had been looking forward to doing. Well that is just what happens to Mortimer Brewster. He is a drama critic who has written books against marriage and has done that exact thing.  He has just married Elaine who is the girl next door. As Mortimer, is getting ready for his honeymoon he discovers that there's a body of an elderly gentleman in the window seat of his loving and caring Aunts' house. (Abby and Martha) This keeps him from living on his honeymoon as soon as he hoped because now he has to do something with the elderly gentleman that he thinks his brother Teddy (who thinks he's Theodore Roosevelt) has killed.  While speaking with his aunts about putting Teddy in happy dell (a sanitarium), Mortimer finds that they're the ones who conspired to poison the man in the window seat. It is one of their ""charities"" to old men who are lonely, miserable and have no family. When Mortimer finds out about this, his aunts' charities have already killed twelve men. The aunts had allowed Teddy to dig the Panama Canal in the basement so they decided that this would be a perfect place to bury the bodies. They told Teddy that the men were yellow fever victims and they'd have to be buried. Every time they poisoned another one with their elderberry wine, they'd send Teddy ""down to Panama"" to dig another lock for the canal. Then they'd give him a ""decent Christian burial."" Mortimer spends the rest of the movie trying to get Teddy committed to Happy DellFrom here the film progress and it gets faster and faster which adds to its comedic fill when Mortimer's other brother Jonathan shows up after Mortimer leaves the house to got get the papers signed to put Teddy in happy Dell. He tells his aunts not to let any one in the house. (He is afraid that thee will kill someone else) Jonathan being some one who has escaped from an asylum for the criminally insane, dose not seem to care that his aunts door is looked and comes in to the house any way. Along with Jonathan is a plastic surgeon named Dr. Einstein. No one recognizes Jonathan because Dr. Einstein has changed Jonathan's appearance but he did it after he'd seen a horror movie. Everyone claims Jonathan looks like Boris Karloff, which makes him angry.  To further complicate matters, Jonathan and Dr. Einstein have a body in the rumble seat of their car. This is the body of a man that Jonathan killed because he knew too much and because he said that Jonathan looked like Boris Karloff. The aunts arrange to have Teddy remove their body from the window seat and take it to the basement after they turn out the lights. Afterwards, Jonathan and Dr. Einstein bring their body in through window. Elaine shows up at the door so Dr. Einstein hides the body in the now empty window seat. While Elaine is there, Jonathan searches for the body, wondering what Dr. Einstein did with it. He explains to Elaine that Dr. Einstein is an eminent surgeon and something of a magician. Mortimer comes home and discovers that there's a different body in the window seat.He soon learns that the new body is one of Jonathan's victims. Mortimer threatens to call the police unless Jonathan leaves with Dr. Einstein and their cold companion. After Jonathan finds out that his aunts have killed twelve people, the same number that he's killed. Jonathan refuses to leave; he plans to murder Mortimer so he has a higher body count than his aunts. His plan doesn't work. The police show up because of Teddy's bugle blowing and arrest Jonathan. Mortimer has told Elaine that they couldn't be married because insanity runs in his family it particle gallops.

114086,A1IOM171PPQ2U8,0790743949,"""mr_nasty""","[10, 11]","As a lover of comedies that feature eccentric characters, this film ranks high on my list as one of the best adaptations of a stage play to the screen.  If you don't like madcap farce or black comedy, then you'd  probably do well to pass this one up; but otherwise you'll enjoy this tale  of a young man who, on the eve of of his wedding, discovers that his two  eccentric old-maid aunts have been killing homeless men and burying them in  their basement as an &quot;act of charity.&quot;  Josephine Hull and Jean  Adair (reprising their Broadway roles) are hysterical, and Cary Grant is a  lot of fun as bundle-of-nerves nephew Mortimer, the only sane Brewster.  John Alexander also recreates the role he made famous on Broadway of Teddy,  Mortimer's unbalanced brother who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt.  Unfortunately, the Broadway play cast Boris Karloff as Mortimer's brother  Jonathan, and seeing as how Jonathan is constantly compared to the  Frankenstein monster, it would have helped had Karloff been cast in the  film version as well; but instead the role went to Raymond Massey, who does  well with it, but some of the humor of the &quot;Frankenstein&quot;  comparisons may be lost on him.  Peter Lorre is also excellent as  Jonathan's sidekick - his role is sort of a sendup of the  &quot;mad-scientist-henchman&quot; role that was prolific in 30's and 40's  monster movies.  And I for one love the scenes with Edward Everett Horton  (some may remember him as the tongue-in-cheek narrator of &quot;Fractured  Fairy Tales&quot; on the old Bullwinkle cartoon show), who plays the  proprietor of Happydale Sanitarium - his straightfaced delivery will have  you in stitches.

Each crazy in a different way. And they play off each other exactly inexactly the right way to have you laughing so hard that your sides will hurt.Many call this dark comedy, and to an extent it is. But it doesn`t really play out that way as you watch the film. You never see amurder or a dead body. All you see are comic results.The family consists of two elderly sisters and their three nephews. The sisters are two of the nicist old ladies you could possiblyever run across, except for one tiny detail. They feed arsnic laced wine to lonely old men and bury them in the basement. They seenothing wrong with this, after all, they look so peaceful once they are dead. They consider it to be one of their charities.The comedic action starts when Cary Grant, the least crazy nephew, discovers this and tries to figure out what to do about it.Their are many complications. Including the fact that he has just been married and is supposed to be headed for his honeymoon.His new bride is quickly becoming as crazy as the rest of the family because her freashly minted groom seems to have all but forgottenabout her in a few short minutes. (She knows nothing of the 12 bodies in the basement)The other two nephews, one thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt and the other a murderer that is at least sane enough to know he is a murderer,mix into the farce along with several other semi-nutty characters.The writing, directing, and acting in this film are all excellent.

The craziness of his portrayal  superbly augments the intended two-headed counterpoint of the original  play. Firstly, that here you have a perfectly normal man who was raised by  two perfectly typical aunts (and count only one weirdo--Teddy--in the  family); who then finds out that his aunts are perfectly atypical--in fact,  crazy--and he starts behaving abnormally; and then add another insanity  case appearing--his other brother--and this originally normal man ends up  acting crazier than all of them! Here this comedic device of escalation is  used to counterpoint the outright insanity exhibited by the rest of his  family! Secondly, a running joke is that insanity runs in the Brewster  family (&quot;...and practically gallops!&quot;), so we have to  believe--until the final revelation--that Mortimer too has inherited the  family genes! Hey, the experts can be wrong. (Heck, Bette Davis didn't  think much of her performance in &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;!!!)

This comedy is appropriate for the Halloween night but you don't get scared by the gentle humor and boring run; at times you may feel it is a drag. I did not enjoy the humor strenuously portrayed by Cary Grant. The movie has constant morbid atmosphere in the air, the house is located right on a cemetery, and his new wife lives next door and his two aunts have 12 dead bodies of old men in the basement; a part of their mercy killing with wine laced with arsenic.Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant), a New York critic of drama marries Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane), the girl next door. Before heading off to Niagara Falls for the honeymoon, Mortimer stops in to see his aunts, Abby Brewster (Josephine Hull) and Martha Brewster (Jean Adair), two sweet little old ladies who donate toys to charity and care for their nephew Teddy Brewster (John Alexander), a bugle blowing nut-bag who thinks he's President Roosevelt. To make matters worse, Mortimer's deranged and dangerous brother Jonathan (Raymond Massey), while on the run from the law, stops by with a dead body in the trunk of his car and a drunken plastic surgeon named Herman Einstein (Peter Lorre). The place is constantly visited by the local police in search of a missing cop. Officer Patrick O'Hara (Jack Carson) as a bumbling cop adds plenty to the confusion and some humor, and the character of Jonathan Brewster which clearly is a direct tribute to Boris Karlof. Peter Lorre as his drunken German sidekick is a riot; bugging his eyes and flinching through the entire film does his best to add a depth to the morbidity of the film.Stanley Kubrick worked on 'Dr. Strangelove' and Frank Capra did the same with this movie. But I still feel Capra is more suited all the great classics he ever made, and Cary Grant is suited for all the romantic movies he made with some of the most beautiful and talented women of Hollywood.

Kesselring,it lifted three of the plays three principals John Alexander,(Teddy Brewster),Jean Adair(Martha Brewster) and Josephine Hull(Abby Brewster) and plunked them down amongst a stellar cast of Hollywood thesps such as Cary Grant(Mortimer Brewster),Priscilla Lane(Elaine Harper),Raymond Massey(Jonathan Brewster),Peter Lorre(Dr Einstein),Edward Everette Horton(Dr Witherspoon),Jack Carson(Officer O'Hara) and many other fine supporting players.The film makers also wanted Boris Karloff to reprise his Broadway role as Jonathan Brewster but he refused the offer(he had a monetary interest in the play).The story involves writer Mortimer Brewster(Grant)who writes books on the pitfalls of marriage.It opens with him and his girlfriend Elaine(Lane)trying to get hitched!It is against his better judgment but Cupids' arrow is firmly planted and there's no escape for him.On the way to their honeymoon destination of Niagara Falls,the now married couple stop off at Elaine's home, which is also near Mortimers' aunts home.They both part to break the news to their relatives;Elaine to her father and Mortimer to his aunts Abby and Martha.His aunts are elated at the news but Mortimer is dumbfounded upon finding a body in the window seat.His aunts are nonplussed as they calmly tell him they poisoned the former lodger plus 12 more that are now buried in the basement.Going back and forth between total apoplexy and controlled confusion Mortimer tries to somehow get a handle on events as they unfold.It seems Mortimer' brother Teddy(who thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt,complete with horn blowing and a charge up San Juan Hill!),has been the digger of the graves for all of the former lodgers of his aunts;each grave a lock for the Panama Canal and each person a yellow fever victim! During all this a not so patient taxi driver awaits the newly wedded couple's departure,the local constabulary drops in and out,Elaine is repeatedly shunted aside as Mortimers' mind wanders aimlessly from one crisis to another and through it all Mortimers aunts try to carry on with their lives as ""normal"".To top matters off completely,Mortimers' other brother Jonathan(Massey),a sadistic killer wanted around the world,accompanied by a Dr Einstein(Lorre),drop in with a body of their own!Jonathan decides his aunts home would be a perfect spot for the doctor to do another operation on his face and as a place to hide.However they also stumble onto the awful truth of what his aunts have been up to with their former boarders and have no intention of going anywhere despite Mortimer's objections.Jonathan ties his hapless brother up and intends to add him to the body count right under the noses of the local police.But they finally cotton on to things and Jonathan is arrested after a bitter struggle.Mortimer through alot of paper signing and phone calls gets his brother Teddy and(unexpectedly)his aunts, committed to the Happydale Sanitarium.The film fades out with the couple in happily ever after land.Arsenic and Old Lace starts out at a relatively even pace,but when Elaine and Mortimer arrive at their respective homes the film takes off and there is no looking back.As the movie and events unfold it is Grant who becomes the storm within the calm,with often hilarious results.He becomes the reluctant victim of events and information that he tries his best to comprehend,but never really gets a solid grip of until the end of the film.Grant does play his part well and as much as I think this era was the finest of his career,there are moments when he goes just a little over the top with his reactions.Also Capra well,being Capra,has a tendency to over tell a story and like many other of his films the details can bog the pace down somewhat;and this is no exception.What saves this black comedic farce is the stellar supporting players.Josephine Hull as Aunt Abby with her tip toe trots to the door,Raymond Massey as menacing a maniacal killer as any you will ever see,John Alexander playing a part he was born to play as an ersatz Teddy Roosevelt,Lorre,doing what Lorre does best and veteran character actor Edward Horton,always a delight in just about everything he did.About the DVD release itself,it is a bare horse;no extras at all.The print used here is a good one and quite clear and crisp.It is housed in a snap jacket.In conclusion while this well known movie farce is good it is not perfect by any means.Along with Grants' moments of over the top joie de vivre,Capra's heavy handedness gets in the way again and even the stellar cast can't over come the film's paucity and less than judicious editing.However in the end it is the beautiful cast,their chemistry and superior acting chops that pull this film up by its' collective boot straps and lands it around the four star category for this reviewer.I recommend this film to all.",4,Great stars in this black comedic farce!,1253923200,"09 26, 2009",2009,4991,"['Arsenic', 'Old', 'Lace',

114115,A3GLF9XK4AUAHS,0790743949,Robert E. Nylund,"[0, 0]","It was very unusual for famed director Frank Capra to adapt a hit Broadway play into a motion picture.  Yet that's exactly what he did in 1941 with the long-running play ""Arsenic and Old Lace.""  However, Warner Brothers had an agreement not to release the film until the play completed its very long run and that didn't happen until 1944, by which time Capra had left Hollywood for wartime service (making outstanding documentaries for the U.S. government).""Arsenic and Old Lace"" is, by any standard, an offbeat, rather ""dark"" comedy since two of its characters, portrayed by Josephine Hull and Jean Adair (from the original Broadway cast), are actually murderers.  However, there is comedy because the two ladies believe they are ""helping"" the elderly gentlemen they kill with poisoned elderberry wine.It is strongly suggested that there is insanity in the family and this becomes more apparent when Cary Grant's brother, portrayed by Raymond Massey, shows up and attempts to bury the body of someone HE murdered.  Massey's character is clearly deranged and horrifying; his face has been changed by his friend Dr. Einstein, portrayed by Peter Lorre, and he gets angry anytime someone suggests that he resembles Boris Karloff.  In the original play Karloff actually played the killer, so the line was particularly funny.Cary Grant's character has just married Priscilla Lane, the pretty blonde actress who worked at both Warners and Universal during the 1940s.  She has the sweetness and innocence that is perfect for this story.  Things really happen when they visit Cary Grant's aunts and he discovers what his aunts are doing.  Then his evil brother arrives, accompanied by the ""mad"" doctor who changed his face.Adding to the comedy are the appearances of John Alexander, who lives with the aunts in the old Brooklyn house and who believes he is Theodore Roosevelt.  Then there is the cop, played by Jack Carson, who tries to impress Cary Grant with a play he has written.  Carson's character somehow doesn't realize what is happening in the house.Veteran composer Max Steiner scored the film, providing just enough dramatic music to underscore the more menacing moments, as well as witty tunes for the comic scenes.Yes, the film was quite different for Frank Capra, who was known for his very touching ""message"" films (without being very preachy), but he did extremely well in adapting a Broadway classic.

Jonathan's companion, &quot;Dr. Einstein&quot;, well played by Peter Lorre, got a litle overzealous while performing plastic surgery on his face, (this surgery necessitated by the fact that both men are serial killers) and the result is an unfortunate resemblance to Frankenstein...Dr. Einstein's excuse for the botched surgery is he had just seen the movie. My other favorite line is Peter Lorre who falls into the window seat and lights a match to see and says &quot;Where am  I? Oh, here I am...&quot; Edward Everett Horton, as the proprietor of the local insane asylum, is also wonderful, as he always is, and is dismayed to hear that he is soon to have yet another Teddy Roosevelt on his hands; and pleads to Grant, when he is trying to admit his brother, (mistakenly believing he is responsible for the &quot;body in the window seat&quot;) &quot;Well, Mr. Brewster, we're a little short of Napoleons at the moment...Bonaparte...and if...oh, I see.&quot; The sisters are great, Hull and Adair, as is Teddy, and the lunacy and fun never stop.

He deals with the press and others who think how hilarious it is that a person who hates marriage would become hitched himself.I'm really sorry that the story shifted so suddenly from this potentially funny theme into something completely different - family insanity and murder.It took some getting used to getting into the whole insane family thing.  I would have liked more regarding his feelings about marriage and struggling with that.  The shift was a bit much for me.Priscilla Lane plays his married girl who pretty much gets ignored and pushed around as Cary Grant's character deals with a major problem with his aunts - they are poisoning old men who are lonely in the world and putting them out of their misery - and burying them in the cellar, 12 and counting!Trying to keep it all together, Mortimer Brewster (Grant) gets the idea to have his brother (who thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt - his charge up the stairs of San Juan Hill are pretty funny) committed and add his aunts to the mix.The strain on his 20 minute marriage is telling but Mortimer wants to handle the bodies before it gets too crazy for him and a prison sentence for his aunts - when his criminal brother shows up!  Played seriously by Raymond Massey and his assistant Dr. Einstein played by Peter Lorre, make their entrance.  Both pretty sketchy characters, they add a measure of menace to an otherwise light comedy.Bottom Line:  Frankly it's not the best Capra nor even the best Cary Grant I've seen - still, it's a classic rendition of comedy and murder as only Grant's comedic, over the top acting could achieve.

Cary is admittedly broad in his playing, yet he's fresh and likeable as Mortimer (Grant himself disliked his performance & claimed he mugged too much for the camera.) the mild-mannered critic of plays who discovers that his kindly elderly aunts (excellently portrayed by veterans Hull and Adair) are actually committing ""mercy killings"" by serving unsuspecting lonely men guests Elderberry wine laced with arsenic! The cast is uniformly excellent with special kudos to Lorre and Massey; Jack Carson as O'Hara the cop is fun and the always welcome Gleason gives his standard stint as Rooney. As Teddy, little-known John Alexander is truly inspired, while Priscilla is cute and decorative as ancy Elaine. Some old movies which were yawned at during their release hold up better today-this is one of them!

114135,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,0790743949,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[5, 7]","+++++This movie welcomes the viewer to the crazy Brewster family. Drama critic Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) has two aunts (Josephine Hall, Jean Adair) who have the &quot;bad habit&quot; of giving lonely old men poisoned wine drinks and then burying them in the cellar; one sociopathic brother (Raymond Massey) who has returned home after twenty years; one bonkers brother who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt (John Alexander) and who has the habit of running up the stairs yelling &quot;chaaaarrrgge&quot; and blowing a bugle; and one impatient new bride (Priscilla Lane), the girl whose house is directly across from the Brewster's, separated only by a cemetery.It's when Mortimer finds out what his aunts are doing and what his sociopathic brother has been and is now doing, that the laughs begin. This movie is filled with unforgettable lines. One of my favorite lines is when one of Mortimer's aunts tells him the &quot;recipe&quot; of their wine drink that has &quot;quite a kick:&quot;&quot;For a gallon of elderberry wine, I take one teaspoon full of arsenic, then add half a teaspoon full of strychnine, and then just a pinch of cyanide.&quot;Throughout this movie, you'll hear talk of or see such things as cemeteries, dead bodies, sanitariums, funerals, the Panama Canal, policemen, yellow fever, squealing cats, and Boris Karloff.Cary Grant displays his comic talents in this movie as he contorts his face into a gallery of surprised reactions and turns his athletic ability into a graceful comic ballet. He along with Priscilla Lane maintain the energy of the movie. Also look for the mad antics of John Alexander who, as Mortimer's bonkers brother, is perfect in his role.The background music for this movie goes from light and cheery in some scenes to grim in others.The only complaint I have is with the character of &quot;Dr.&quot; Einstein played by Peter Lorre. I feel that Lorre's considerable comedic talents were not fully utilized.Finally, the DVD (which has the movie in full screen) has a serious lack of extras. However I found the one entitled &quot;Stage to Screen&quot; informative.In conclusion, this is an unusual but hilarious movie.

""Pop Culture Addict""","[6, 21]","Frank Capra and Cary Grant are clearly two of the brightest shining stars of the golden era of film, but their collaboration in &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; leaves something to be desired.  The premise of the film is certainly more outrageous than the other comedies that came out during the Forties.  Yet, outrageousness alone does not make for a good film.Mortimer Brewster (Grant) comes home to visit his aunts with his new wife, Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane), in tow.  Mortimer is soon in for a shock when he discovers what his aunts - Abby Brewster (Josephine Hull) and Martha Brewster (Jean Adair) - have been doing to pass the time.  It turns out that they've been taking in elderly men as boarders and murdering them in order to end their loneliness.  Trying to find a way to explain away what happened to their latest victim, Mortimer concocts a plan to blame the death on his younger brother Theodore (John Alexander).  However, the ill-timed return home of older brother Jonathan (Raymond Massey) complicates matters even further.All of the performers turn in admirable efforts, but &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; just does not have as sharp or as witty a script as the screwball comedies that populated the preceding decade.  While the subject matter of the film certainly isn't the stuff of comedy, the more fatal aspect that prevents it from being entertaining is the manner in which its characters are employed.  Characters just seem to appear out of left field to keep the story moving along instead of springing forth from the story organically.  There's Theodore running down the stairs to offer a way out of the predicament.  There's brother Jonathan returning home in order to create another level of chaos.  There's Dr. Einstein (Peter Lorre) making a cameo so that Peter Lorre can be squeezed into the film.  In the end, &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; just feels like a structurally-staged production rather than an effort to tell a legitimate story.",2,&quot;Insanity runs in my family . . . it practically gallops!&quot;,1087171200,"06 14, 2004",2004,1981,"['Frank', 'Capra', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'are', 'clearly', 'two', 'brightest', 'shining', 'stars', 'golden', 'era', 'film', 'collaboration', 'quot', 'Arsenic', 'Old', 'Lace', 'quot', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'premise', 'film', 'certainly', 'more', 'outrageous', 'other', 'comedies', 'came', 'out', 'Forties', 'outrageousness', 'alone', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'film.Mortimer', 'Brewster', 'Grant', 'home', 'visit', 'aunts', 'new', 'wife', 'Elaine', 'Harper', 'Priscilla', 'Lane', 'tow', 'Mortimer', 'soon', 'shock', 'when', 'what', 'aunts', 'Abby', 'Brewster', 'Josephine', 'Hull', 'Martha', 'Brewster', 'Jean', 'Adair', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'pass', 'time', 'out', ""'ve"", 'been', 'taking', 'elderly', 'men', 'boarders', 'murdering', 'order', 'end', 'loneliness', 'Trying', 'find', 'way', 'explain', 'away', 'what', 'happened', 'latest', 'victim', 'Mortimer', 'plan', 'blame', 'death', 'younger', 'brother', 'Theodore', 'John', 'Alexander', 'However', 'ill-timed', 'return', 'home', 'older', 'brother', 'Jonathan', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'matters', 'even', 'further.All', 'performers', 'turn', 'admirable', 'efforts', 'quot', 'Arsenic', 'Old', 'Lace', 'quot', 'just', 'not', 'have', 'sharp', 'witty', 'script', 'screwball', 'populated', 'preceding', 'decade', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'stuff', 'comedy', 'more', 'fatal', 'aspect', 'being', 'entertaining', 'manner', 'characters', 'are', 'employed', 'Characters', 'just', 'seem', 'appear', 'left', 'field', 'keep', 'story', 'moving', 'along', 'instead', 'springing', 'forth', 'story', 'organically', 'Theodore', 'running', 'down', 'stairs', 'offer', 'way', 'predicament', 'brother', 'Jonathan', 'returning', 'home', 'order', 'create', 'level', 'chaos', 'Dr.', 'Einstein', 'Peter', 'Lorre', 'making', 'cameo', 'Peter', 'Lorre', 'can', 'be', 'squeezed', 'film', 'end', 'quot', 'Arsenic', 'Old', 'Lace', 'quot', 'just', 'feels', 'structurally-staged', 'production', 'rather', 'effort', 'tell', 'legitimate', 'story']",N/A

Although this was one of Cary Grant's least favorite performances, his comedic talents shine, offsetting the rather low key peformances by the other members of the cast.The movie stays fairly close to the play, especially in dialogue. The major difference being that Mortimer and Elaine are married rather than just engaged.The movie starts off rather slow, but quickly picks up steam and doesn't lift up until the film's conclusion.

Priebe ""WFP""","[24, 28]","While I am not a particular advocate of older classics and the movie's  premise is a little hard to take, I found this film delightful. This is  classic comedy at its best. It is a relief from the slapstick coming of age  comedies of today. Many may be familiar with the stage play. This 1944  version is an outstanding adaptation to film.The story line revolves  around the sweet old Brewster sisters (Josephine Hull and Jean Adair) and  their efforts to solve loneliness of older bachelors with elderberry wine  spiked with arsenic. The sisters' nephew Mortimer (Cary Grant) discovers  their secret. Mortimer is not unreasonably concerned that the insainity  runs in the family, especially given that his older brother Jonathan  (Raymond Massey) is a murderous escaped convict and his uncle Teddy (John  Alexander) is convinced that he's really Theodore Roosevelt, (running  around the house yelling &quot;CHAAAAARGGGE&quot;). Mortimer isn't keen on  starting a family with his new bride, Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane) with  the family trait hanging over his head.One would expect Grant to carry  the show with his dry wit (his response to the unexpected, different body  in the window seat is arguably the finest sight gag in any movie) but the  real stars of the movie are Josephine Hull and Jean Adair (who for some  reason are always way down in the list of characters). They steal every  scene they are in. The only weakness is casting Peter Lorre as Dr.  Einstein, Raymond Massey's sidekick. He adds moodiness to his scenes that  detract from the picture's light heartiness. But even he over acts his part  and makes it into a parody of his other films.  Pick a time when you need  to escape and watch it with some friends. If you can get through the entire  movie without laughing out loud, you are really depressed.",5,Delightful Classic Comedy,968025600,"09 4, 2000",2000,1826,"['am', 'not', 'particular', 'advocate', 'older', 'classics', 'movie', 'premise', 'little', 'hard', 'take', 'found', 'film', 'delightful', 'classic', 'comedy', 'best', 'relief', 'slapstick', 'coming', 'age', 'comedies', 'today', 'Many', 'may', 'be', 'familiar', 'stage', 'play', '1944', 'version', 'outstanding', 'adaptation', 'film.The', 'story', 'line', 'sweet', 'old', 'Brewster', 'sisters', 'Josephine', 'Hull', 'Jean', 'Adair', 'efforts', 'solve', 'loneliness', 'older', 'bachelors', 'elderberry', 'wine', 'spiked', 'arsenic', 'sisters', 'nephew', 'Mortimer', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'secret', 'Mortimer', 'not', 'unreasonably', 'concerned', 'insainity', 'family', 'especially', 'given', 'older', 'brother', 'Jonathan', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'murderous', 'escaped', 'convict', 'uncle', 'Teddy', 'John', 'Alexander', 'convinced', 'really', 'Theodore', 'Roosevelt', 'running', 'around', 'house', 'yelling', 'quot', 'CHAAAAARGGGE', 'quot', 'Mortimer', ""n't"", 'keen', 'starting', 'family', 'new', 'bride', 'Elaine', 'Harper', 'Priscilla', 'Lane', 'family', 'trait', 'hanging', 'head.One', 'would', 'expect', 'Grant', 'carry', 'show', 'dry', 'wit', 'response', 'unexpected', 'different', 'body', 'window', 'seat', 'arguably', 'finest', 'sight', 'gag', 'movie', 'real', 'stars', 'movie', 'are', 'Josephine', 'Hull', 'Jean', 'Adair', 'who', 'reason', 'are', 'always', 'way', 'down', 'list', 'characters', 'steal', 'scene', 'are', 'only', 'weakness', 'casting', 'Peter', 'Lorre', 'Dr.', 'Einstein', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'sidekick', 'moodiness', 'scenes', 'detract', 'picture', 'light', 'heartiness', 'even', 'over', 'part', 'parody', 'other', 'films', 'Pick', 'time', 'when', 'need', 'escape', 'watch', 'friends', 'can', 'get', 'entire', 'movie', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'are', 'really', 'depressed']",N/A
