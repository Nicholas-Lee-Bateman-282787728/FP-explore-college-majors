Her husband Arthur Jameson is a criminal lawyer who is successful. ""Good luck to you all."" Arthur skips out from the meeting; is he up to no good? He breaks into a house. [No gloves to avoid fingerprints?] ""Is someone there?"" Arthur plays innocent and shocks his wife. She doesn't realize his purpose until its too late! Can a criminal lawyer stage the perfect crime? There is an interesting scene where Arthur is questioned by a prosecutor. How good is his alibi? ""Means, motive, opportunity."" But is this a fantasy? [The taxicab dates this picture.] Would smoking cause a death? We learn more about Arthur and Louise. What about a ""natural death""? Arthur makes plans.A visitor arrives: Miss Jackie Willis, a neighbor. She needs to visit the next door neighbors to water their plants. There is a surprise here! Will Louise suspect something? Was she practicing? Will Arthur drink his coffee? ""What the hell is this?"" Louise explains what happened. The story explains the background. Louise wrote a letter and put it in her safe-deposit box. Is this a game? Jackie learned a lot from her different jobs. ""We know what we're doing."" A recording is admissible in court if one person knows of it. What if there is an accident? Can Arthur fix things? Apparently not. Will there be another surprise? The ending echoes the beginning.This talking story is basically a stage play. The team of Richard Levison & William Link wrote many TV shows in the 1970s and 1980s. The background of this film suggests a seaside location. It is an interesting story that can also be a parody of murder mysteries.",4,Planning a Murder,1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,1668,"['film', 'woman', 'home', 'night', 'stand', '.38', 'revolver', 'husband', 'Arthur', 'Jameson', 'criminal', 'lawyer', 'who', 'successful', 'Good', 'luck', 'Arthur', 'out', 'meeting', 'up', 'good', 'house', 'gloves', 'avoid', 'fingerprints', ']', 'someone', 'there', 'Arthur', 'innocent', 'shocks', 'wife', ""n't"", 'realize', 'purpose', 'too', 'late', 'Can', 'criminal', 'lawyer', 'stage', 'perfect', 'crime', 'interesting', 'scene', 'where', 'Arthur', 'questioned', 'prosecutor', 'How', 'good', 'alibi', 'Means', 'motive', 'opportunity', 'fantasy', 'taxicab', 'picture', ']', 'Would', 'smoking', 'cause', 'death', 'learn', 'more', 'Arthur', 'Louise', 'What', 'natural', 'death', 'Arthur', 'plans.A', 'visitor', 'arrives', 'Miss', 'Jackie', 'Willis', 'neighbor', 'visit', 'next', 'door', 'neighbors', 'water', 'plants', 'surprise', 'here', 'Will', 'Louise', 'suspect', 'something', 'Was', 'practicing', 'Will', 'Arthur', 'drink', 'coffee', 'What', 'hell', 'Louise', 'what', 'happened', 'story', 'background', 'Louise', 'wrote', 'letter', 'put', 'safe-deposit', 'box', 'game', 'Jackie', 'learned', 'lot', 'different', 'jobs', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'recording', 'admissible', 'court', 'one', 'person', 'What', 'accident', 'Can', 'Arthur', 'fix', 'things', 'Apparently', 'not', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'surprise', 'ending', 'beginning.This', 'talking', 'story', 'basically', 'stage', 'play', 'team', 'Richard', 'Levison', 'William', 'Link', 'wrote', 'many', 'TV', 'shows', '1970s', '1980s', 'background', 'film', 'seaside', 'location', 'interesting', 'story', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'parody', 'murder', 'mysteries']",N/A

Luster ""The Rook""","[0, 0]","I don't quite agree this DVD is horrible, but to me that only paid $5.47 and have paid more for used, I suppose it is a matter of what you expect. Furthermore this movie was made at a time when the quality of the original wasn't all that great. Go back and look at other movies of this period and you will see the color and sound wasn't very good. This DVD in fact is not a great transfer. It almost looked like it might have been copied from VHS in the beginning of it, but it does improve somewhat as the movie progresses. The sound isn't great either, but all-in-all this is watchable and the story is very interesting. In a nutshell an attorney played by Anthony Hopkins imagines ways he would kill his wife and even ways his wife and mistress would kill him, but not till the last minutes do you see a murder and know they won't get away with it. But before the murder you will see Hopkins argue with himself on the lack of merits on various methods of disposing of his wife and then with his wife and mistress on how they plan to dispose of him. His skills at argueing his points will make you truly think he is a barrister. It was interesting to hear Hopkins say ""Quid Pro Quo"" as well since it was more menacing in a later movie. I would love to see this on a better quality DVD as well but I have no complaints here considering the price.",3,"Guilty Conscience is good story, fair DVD",1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,1347,"['do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'agree', 'DVD', 'horrible', 'only', 'paid', '5.47', 'have', 'paid', 'more', 'used', 'suppose', 'matter', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'time', 'when', 'quality', 'original', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'Go', 'back', 'look', 'other', 'movies', 'period', 'will', 'see', 'color', 'sound', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'DVD', 'fact', 'not', 'great', 'transfer', 'almost', 'looked', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'copied', 'VHS', 'beginning', 'improve', 'somewhat', 'movie', 'sound', ""n't"", 'great', 'all-in-all', 'watchable', 'story', 'very', 'interesting', 'nutshell', 'attorney', 'played', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'imagines', 'ways', 'would', 'kill', 'wife', 'even', 'ways', 'wife', 'mistress', 'would', 'kill', 'not', 'till', 'last', 'minutes', 'do', 'see', 'murder', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'murder', 'will', 'see', 'Hopkins', 'argue', 'lack', 'merits', 'various', 'methods', 'disposing', 'wife', 'then', 'wife', 'mistress', 'how', 'plan', 'dispose', 'skills', 'argueing', 'points', 'will', 'make', 'truly', 'think', 'barrister', 'was', 'interesting', 'hear', 'Hopkins', 'say', 'Quid', 'Pro', 'Quo', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'more', 'menacing', 'later', 'movie', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'better', 'quality', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'complaints', 'here', 'considering', 'price']",N/A

He decides to off his wife (Blythe Danner) in favor of the latest in a long line of mistresses, and as he pictures various methods, he debates the pros and cons with himself.This 1985 made-for-TV movie is all talk; it's witty and clever but also quite devoid of emotion and gets old after a while.  Hopkins is very good in dual roles as Arthur and the devil's advocate with whom he discusses the merits of his plans.  Danner plays the wealthy, somewhat scatter-brained matron well, but hers is an unsympathetic role.  As the off-beat, streetwise mistress, Swoozie Kurtz is an odd choice because she lacks any appeal or chemistry with Hopkins.The movie is almost too clever for it's own good, being one long, somewhat tedious exercise in courtoom ""What if?""  Although it's about murder, there is no suspense and I was glad when it was over. The endless legalese would certainly be of interest to attorneys and law students, however.It should be noted that this DVD is an extremely poor transfer.  It looks like a taped-at-home video.

Contrary to the previous reviews that I just read, I felt that it was important to express my views on this film because all of the reviews strictly concentrated on the quality of the DVD or VHS, and rarely if at all spoke about the movie itself.  I had no problem with the quality of the film, it reminded me of a 1984 quality even though it was released in 1999, which doesn't bother me at all.  The film itself was very interesting.  I felt that the writer had a unique idea in the fact that one of the main characters, Anthony Hopkins, a smart criminal attorney, talks to himself out loud, while actually seeing himself.  He prosecutes himself in order to make sense of the case at hand. While he is working on an alibi and a plot to kill his wife.  Meanwhile, there are so many different scenarios that he mull's over and that are played out for the audience to imagine and visualize.  As the movie develops, we discover that his wife gets involved with his mistress, and together, they plot HIS murder.  The only difference between Anthony and his wife, is that because of his professional background, he is busy thinking and planning logically about how it would play out after her death. The ironic part is that the mistress and the wife wined up carrying out HIS original plan, which by the way he already ruled out because it would incriminate him.  I guess it's like if you snooze you lose or more so, he seemed to think too much about the consequences and in the end, his wife actually provaled because she didn't hesitate, although, we don't see into the after effects of the murder because it ended not abruptly, but shortly after this took place, which by the way, was my only disappointment because the movie could have gone on for another 25 minutes and I still wouldn't mind at all.",4,A complete difference in opinion,1116720000,"05 22, 2005",2005,1840,"['bought', 'dvd', '1.00', 'walmart', 'Contrary', 'previous', 'reviews', 'just', 'read', 'felt', 'was', 'important', 'express', 'views', 'film', 'reviews', 'strictly', 'concentrated', 'quality', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'rarely', 'spoke', 'movie', 'had', 'problem', 'quality', 'film', 'reminded', '1984', 'quality', 'even', 'was', 'released', '1999', ""n't"", 'bother', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'felt', 'writer', 'had', 'unique', 'idea', 'fact', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'smart', 'criminal', 'attorney', 'talks', 'loud', 'actually', 'seeing', 'order', 'make', 'sense', 'case', 'hand', 'working', 'alibi', 'plot', 'kill', 'wife', 'Meanwhile', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'scenarios', 'mull', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'audience', 'imagine', 'visualize', 'movie', 'discover', 'wife', 'involved', 'mistress', 'together', 'plot', 'HIS', 'murder', 'only', 'difference', 'Anthony', 'wife', 'professional', 'background', 'busy', 'thinking', 'planning', 'logically', 'how', 'would', 'play', 'out', 'death', 'ironic', 'part', 'mistress', 'wife', 'wined', 'up', 'carrying', 'out', 'HIS', 'original', 'plan', 'way', 'already', 'ruled', 'out', 'would', 'incriminate', 'guess', 'snooze', 'lose', 'more', 'so', 'seemed', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'consequences', 'end', 'wife', 'actually', 'provaled', 'did', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'effects', 'murder', 'ended', 'not', 'abruptly', 'shortly', 'took', 'place', 'way', 'was', 'only', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'gone', '25', 'minutes', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind']",N/A

His wife (Blythe Danner) has decided to file for divorce and is planning to milk him for all he is worth.  Since Arthur doesn't want that, he needs to figure out a way to kill his wife.  But, being the attorney he is, he knows that he'd be the first suspect.  While he plots various ways to bring about her demise, his mistress (Swoosie Kurtz) shows up unexpectedly.  Now what will Arthur do?This is an interesting little made for TV movie from the mid-80's, made long before any of the stars were a success.  It has a bit of a low budget feel, but all three stars do a great job acting.  It almost feels like a play since almost all of it takes place in Arthur and Louise's house and these three characters are the only real characters.The plot is hard to discuss without giving anything away.  We get several sequences of Arthur's plots to kill his wife and then the cross examination he images he'll have when the case goes to trial.  I was getting a little bored with the movie, but half way through there's a great twist that grabbed my interest for the remainder of the film.While the movie itself is 5 stars, I had to take a couple off for the DVD transfer.  It's absolutely horrid.  The picture looks like it is a third of fourth generation VHS recording.
