Pierre,"[0, 1]","Stone Cold narrates this documentary over the years 96-97 and is much better then Hell Yeah: Stone Cold's Saga Continues, which covers the years 98-99. This is the set I was looking for and shows why I liked Austin in the first place. The only problem with the dvd is you gotta sit thru 3:02 of previews you cannot skip over. Other then that, it's a pretty good one hour overview of Austin in 96-97.",5,Stone Cold 96-97,1265414400,"02 6, 2010",2010,399,"['Stone', 'Cold', 'documentary', 'years', '96-97', 'much', 'better', 'then', 'Hell', 'Yeah', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'Saga', 'Continues', 'years', '98-99', 'set', 'was', 'looking', 'why', 'liked', 'Austin', 'first', 'place', 'only', 'problem', 'dvd', 'got', 'ta', 'sit', 'thru', '3:02', 'previews', 'can', 'not', 'skip', 'Other', 'then', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'hour', 'overview', 'Austin', '96-97']",N/A

Rather, it's a 2003 re-release (on DVD) of a 1998 VHS tape of the same name. On this disc, hosted by &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin himself, you'll find highlights of his first two years in the WWE. It includes his King of the Ring 1996 transformation to the bada$$ he is today. It also highlights some of his greatest disses, &quot;a$$-whoopins&quot;, and matches before late 1997. Also, it makes note of some of his greatest feuds, with the likes of Brian Pillman, Vader and Bret &quot;The Hitman&quot; Hart. If you own this original release, I don't suggest you pick it up. It is absolutely no different than the original version. If you don't have it, however, you might as well get it. It's a very good buy for the Amazon price of $9.98.",3,And That's The Bottom Line..,1084492800,"05 14, 2004",2004,828,"['Contrary', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'assume', 'not', 'brand-new', 'release', 'WWE', 'Rather', '2003', 're-release', 'DVD', '1998', 'VHS', 'tape', 'same', 'name', 'disc', 'hosted', 'quot', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'quot', 'Steve', 'Austin', ""'ll"", 'find', 'highlights', 'first', 'two', 'years', 'WWE', 'King', 'Ring', '1996', 'transformation', 'bada', 'today', 'also', 'greatest', 'disses', 'quot', '-whoopins', 'quot', 'matches', 'late', '1997', 'Also', 'note', 'greatest', 'feuds', 'likes', 'Brian', 'Pillman', 'Vader', 'Bret', 'quot', 'Hitman', 'quot', 'Hart', 'own', 'original', 'release', 'do', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'pick', 'up', 'absolutely', 'different', 'original', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'however', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'very', 'good', 'buy', 'Amazon', 'price', '9.98']",N/A

He's hilarious to watch as he basically overcomes everyone with his fists and trash-talking. You can see an energy and real ""rawness"" that is not present in today's WWE. This was when they let wrestlers develop their own characters, instead of just handing them a script, and I can really tell the difference.",5,Great intro to Steve Austin,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,454,"['movie', 'awesome..', 'shows', 'Mr.', 'Austin', 'starting', 'out', 'WWF', 'heel', 'hell-raiser', 'injuries', 'politics', 'caught', 'up', 'hilarious', 'watch', 'basically', 'everyone', 'fists', 'trash-talking', 'can', 'see', 'energy', 'real', 'rawness', 'not', 'present', 'today', 'WWE', 'was', 'when', 'let', 'wrestlers', 'develop', 'own', 'characters', 'instead', 'just', 'handing', 'script', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'difference']",N/A

I really found this sixty minute video quite entertaining actually. Pretty great stuff before Owen broke his neck, so he is capable to work an awesome match plus he was really determined in his promos rising to the top. The problem I have is that there is no extra features which does not really make any sense since it is a Digital Video Disc. Nonetheless it's a quite entertaining watch.
