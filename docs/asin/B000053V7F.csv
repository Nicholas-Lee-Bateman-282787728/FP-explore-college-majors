565255,A24Q40NN7O07GK,B000053V7F,Jon Morris,"[4, 4]","First off, let me say that I rate this film a 4-star on it's theatrical merit's only. The film is entertaining and well acted and I enjoyed it immensely from this standpoint.That being said, as far as historical facts are considered and being historically accurate, I would rate the movie a 1 or 2-star at best. It is incredibly inaccurate and omits some of the most important Negro League players of the time including Larry Doby who would follow Jackie Robinson into the Major Leagues just a short time later. Paige did not have a good relationship with Gibson or Robinson as is portrayed in the movie, and if my research is accurate, did not have an off field relationship with either player whatsoever, good or bad.I am a HUGE fan of (what I consider to be) the greatest era of baseball (or any sport for that matter) - the fifty years of the game between 1915-1965, and have done exstensive research on the sport (which is not limited to just the major leagues, but Negro League, minor league play, Latin Leagues, the A.A.G.P.B.L, and Semi-Pro ball as well). Historical accuracy was obviously not of major concern when the movie was written and dramatization of real-life historical figures for cinematic purposes was exercised in the making of this film.That being said, the movie itself is excellent in every way. The time frame is represented extremely well and the characters are richly portrayed by three fine actors in Lindo, Underwood, and Williamson. It stands as a great dramatic film and should be viewed as such, with no consideration to facts, much like ""A League of Their Own"" (1992) which portrayed the A.A.G.P.B.L very well, but again, with no attention to historical facts.",4,"A good ""movie"", but in no way based on historical fact",1328486400,"02 6, 2012",2012,1694,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'rate', 'film', '4-star', 'theatrical', 'merit', 'only', 'film', 'entertaining', 'well', 'acted', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'standpoint.That', 'being', 'said', 'as', 'far', 'historical', 'facts', 'are', 'considered', 'being', 'historically', 'accurate', 'would', 'rate', 'movie', '1', '2-star', 'best', 'incredibly', 'inaccurate', 'most', 'important', 'Negro', 'League', 'players', 'time', 'including', 'Larry', 'Doby', 'who', 'would', 'follow', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'Major', 'Leagues', 'just', 'short', 'time', 'later', 'Paige', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'good', 'relationship', 'Gibson', 'Robinson', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'research', 'accurate', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'off', 'field', 'relationship', 'player', 'whatsoever', 'good', 'bad.I', 'am', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'greatest', 'era', 'baseball', 'sport', 'matter', 'fifty', 'years', 'game', '1915-1965', 'have', 'done', 'exstensive', 'research', 'sport', 'not', 'limited', 'just', 'major', 'leagues', 'Negro', 'League', 'minor', 'league', 'play', 'Latin', 'Leagues', 'A.A.G.P.B.L', 'Semi-Pro', 'ball', 'as', 'well', 'Historical', 'accuracy', 'was', 'obviously', 'not', 'major', 'concern', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'dramatization', 'real-life', 'historical', 'figures', 'cinematic', 'purposes', 'was', 'exercised', 'making', 'film.That', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'excellent', 'way', 'time', 'frame', 'represented', 'extremely', 'well', 'characters', 'are', 'richly', 'portrayed', 'three', 'fine', 'actors', 'Lindo', 'Underwood', 'Williamson', 'great', 'dramatic', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'such', 'consideration', 'facts', 'much', 'A', 'League', 'Their', 'Own', '1992', 'portrayed', 'A.A.G.P.B.L', 'very', 'well', 'again', 'attention', 'historical', 'facts']",N/A
565256,A1FNW6H983I87V,B000053V7F,"Loves To Read ""Lu""","[0, 0]","This HBO movie is almost a docudrama. While the facts aren't necessarily historically accurate, the people involved are historical and the overall story happened. It's 1945 and it's time for baseball to integrate. There are two 'separate but unequal' professional baseball leagues. There is the Negro League and the Major League. Everyone knows integration has to happen and it will be sooner rather than later. But Judge Landis, the Major League Commissioner keeps trying to stop it. Some of the greatest players in America are being kept out of Major League baseball because of the color of their skin. Branch Rickey, general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, is anxious to bring Negroes into the league, not only because he knows they belong there, but he knows what they can do for his team. Under the pretext of wanting to start another team in Brooklyn for the Negro League, he begins to seriously 'scout' the Negro League for talent. He's really looking for the right one to break the color barrier. He knows it will take a very special player, not only talented, but someone who has the courage NOT to fight back. The film centers around three of the top, if not the top, candidates to be that pioneer: Satchell Paige, the legendary and colorful pitcher, Josh Gibson, a catcher and one of the greatest hitters ever to play the game (white or black) and Jackie Robinson, the college graduate and football star as well as tank commander in the Army who is new to the Negro League. We all know, of course, that Jackie Robinson became the first Negro Major League player and what an amazing career he had and how he opened the doors for scores of great black players to follow. In this film, we see the competition between these three legendary players as they begin to understand what might be happening when a certain white scout keeps showing up at the games. We see the genius of Branch Rickey as he goes through the decision making process, knowing that the first player must be the right one or it will set the cause back for decades perhaps. A terrific movie with a good historical basis as well as some creative imagination about the relationships between these three great players. Language might be a little rough for younger children but older teens and up will definitely enjoy this outstanding made for TV movie.

It is historically  accurate in general, or at least as accurate as the embellished stories  that have been passed down can be.I enjoyed the performances of the  three main characters, but particularly loved Delroy Lindo's portrayl of  Satch Paige.  He was &quot;over-the-top&quot; showing how Satch worked the  crowd and did what was necessary to draw crowds to the game.  Having read a  biography of Josh Gibson's, that actors physical characteristics and  portrayl matched what I had previously read about perfectly.I rate  movies on two main criteria: 1. Do I learn something from the movie, and 2.  Does it emotionally attach me to the story.  I score this movie highly on  both points.  While it is not a big budget movie, it accurately gives you a  feel of the old Negro league games and the problems faced.  But this movie  really scores for &quot;emotionally&quot; involving you in the story.  From  the bigoted southern girl selling fruit to the decision on who would  finally play in the majors.  My personal favorite is how they overlayed  Willie Mays in the story.  The Willie Mays finale sends chills up my spine  on the handshake every time.Watch this movie and you will not be  disappointed.

For example, Delroy Lindo gives an interesting performance, but he doesn't look like the real Satchel Paige and often doesn't sound like him either. Also, Rachel Robinson, Lee Lowenfish and Red Barber have all pointed out the importance of faith in the Branch Rickey/ Jackie Robinson story, but the closest the movie Rickey and Robinson come to portraying that is when they use profanity. The movie's historical inaccuracies diminish its persuasiveness and make the characterizations less complex.
