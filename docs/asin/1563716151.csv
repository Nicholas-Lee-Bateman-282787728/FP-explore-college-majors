We suffered through the movie and had a good laugh over it afterwards.  I mean someone really made this movie and thought it was great????!!  The acting is 3rd rate, the dialogue is just strange and the whole story line is a bit bizarre.  My first idea that the movie wouldn't be great was when the mom was giving her daughter a little talk at dinner time.  Ok, here it is, not exactly:  Mom ""honey, remember the story I told you about the little girl who looked out her window and saw her brother burying the family pet, and she was crying?  Her father came up to her and took her to another window  and she saw a beautiful flower and she smiled. Her father told her she was just looking out the wrong window"". (HUH?)  The little girl then says, ""But dad is dead"".  And her father was dead, and what the heck kind of parable/story is that to tell a kid. It has become a running joke in our house, whenever my kid gets upset over something, I tell her to look out another window.And the little girl actress/whiny girl named Sonny, couldn't they have given her crutches that actually fit her and teach her how to use them??  I think not, it was like this girl dragged her crutch around everywhere, bending her hurt leg like nothing was wrong with it.  Helloooo!In no time at all does this girl befriend a dangerous horse and fall in love with it.  And she is able to buy it for $4. Hellooo, let's get real.  I know I am getting annoying with this review, but this movie was annoying.  The mother/doctor relationship is freakish, I didn't get it. One minute she is a mom at her daughters doctor office, the next minute they are eating out, and before you know it, he is proposing. What the heck?And as others have said, why is the horse Ginger called 'she' throughout the movie, when it is plain as day that the horse is a male????  We can see its genitalia throughout the movie and most of us are not stupid.  Was there really not another ginger colored horse that was a female available for this part?  And this wonder girl, Sonny, she must be amazing to barrel race and win on a horse within a month of learning to ride.  Fantastic and so realistic. NOT.  Don't get me started on the mean girl who also barrel raced and her mom.  Bizarre characters indeed. Cheesy stuff.This movie should really be a spoof of a real movie.
