1264359,A2X1QIG0J9IB0V,B002DY9KR0,19th century brit lit fan,"[11, 14]","She was an excellent Elinor. I also liked that she was portrayed very pretty. All the other adaptations I have seen, portray Elinor of average attractiveness, even though the actresses portraying Elinor were very attractive in real life. I also liked that Elinor and Marianne looked enough alike that they could be sisters.What I did not like, was Edward was portrayed as shy, insecure and bumbling. It also seemed to me Marianne was portrayed much too self centered and selfish, much more than her character who was somewhat selfish in the novel, should have been. This portrayal overshadowed Marianne's good qualities, such as the deep love and loyalty she felt for her mother and sisters.Which is another  disappointment, I also missed  that there was no Margaret in this adaptation. I missed that in the 1981 adaptation also, but that adaptation otherwise I found very good.I did find I enjoyed the portrayal of Colonel Brandon and Willoughby the best in this adaptation. Both were much more likable in this.It seemed there were several scenes and dialogue, either added or changed, from the novel, which I disliked. I felt this was the most unfaithful adaptation I have seen.Bottom line, if you are a Janeite, or a loyal fan of BBC period fiction adaptations, you will still want to add this to your collection. However, I  believe you will find you prefer the 1981, or the 1995 or the 2008 adaptations, over this.",3,I  enjoyed Joanna David's Performance,1254614400,"10 4, 2009",2009,1419,"['was', 'excellent', 'Elinor', 'also', 'liked', 'was', 'portrayed', 'very', 'pretty', 'other', 'adaptations', 'have', 'seen', 'portray', 'Elinor', 'average', 'attractiveness', 'even', 'actresses', 'portraying', 'Elinor', 'were', 'very', 'attractive', 'real', 'life', 'also', 'liked', 'Elinor', 'Marianne', 'looked', 'enough', 'could', 'be', 'sisters.What', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'Edward', 'was', 'portrayed', 'shy', 'insecure', 'bumbling', 'also', 'seemed', 'Marianne', 'was', 'portrayed', 'much', 'too', 'self', 'centered', 'selfish', 'much', 'more', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'somewhat', 'selfish', 'novel', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'portrayal', 'overshadowed', 'Marianne', 'good', 'qualities', 'such', 'deep', 'love', 'loyalty', 'felt', 'mother', 'sisters.Which', 'disappointment', 'also', 'missed', 'was', 'Margaret', 'adaptation', 'missed', '1981', 'adaptation', 'also', 'adaptation', 'otherwise', 'found', 'very', 'good.I', 'did', 'find', 'enjoyed', 'portrayal', 'Colonel', 'Brandon', 'Willoughby', 'best', 'adaptation', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'likable', 'this.It', 'seemed', 'were', 'several', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'either', 'added', 'changed', 'novel', 'disliked', 'felt', 'was', 'most', 'unfaithful', 'adaptation', 'have', 'seen.Bottom', 'line', 'are', 'Janeite', 'loyal', 'fan', 'BBC', 'period', 'fiction', 'adaptations', 'will', 'still', 'want', 'add', 'collection', 'However', 'believe', 'will', 'find', 'prefer', '1981', '1995', '2008', 'adaptations']",Sense and Sensibility

1264361,A11HGU745RNY3W,B002DY9KR0,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie.  I recently watched the earliest BBC version of Emma and was disappointed.  I was expecting similar acting in this film, but from the first half hour, I could tell I wouldn't feel that way.  I was tempted to write a review before I finished watching it, I was so pleased!What I enjoy most about this film adaptation of Sense and Sensibility is the cast!  Elinor was just wonderful.  One other reviewer commented that she was made attractive, whereas most Elinors in other adaptations were made to look plain.  I too, enjoyed that Elinor was beautiful in this movie.  In truth, I don't remember from the book whether Elinor is supposed to be plain or attractive.Marianne was, I think very good.  There were a couple of times she seemed to be over the top, but from what I remember of the story, that could be a reasonable portrayl.Edward was very good.  Mrs. Jennings was fabulous.  The Misses Steeles were very good, I thought.  A big improvement over some some of the later movies.  Willoughby was fine - I don't think the audience is given enough time to be drawn to him.  Sir John Middleton, outrageous as he is, does seem to fit the book, as I remember it.There are two reasons I gave this adaptation a four rather than a five.  The first is that there were several marked differences in dialogue and events.  The youngest Miss Dashwood is eliminated, which I think is unfortunate, as her presence helps to endear Edward to the audience (and to Elinor).  Also, at the end of the story, Elinor's emotional outburst has been eliminated.  I felt that THAT was an inexcusable omission.  Elinor is so calm throughout the story that her emotions getting the better of her is a very significant part of the story.  There were other, smaller, differences as well. It is still decently faithful, even with those changes.The second reason is that the ending seemed a bit awkward.  It sort of just fades out, and it doesn't feel like it should end there.  I found that unfortunate, since I felt that the execution of the film was very good throughout the whole three hours . . until the very last two minutes!One other difficulty (which had no affect on my rating) was that the camera seemed at times to be unfocused.But I really enjoyed it throughout!  The acting in the very first minute or two felt ""stagy"" (a term a couple of other reviewers have used), but it really didn't feel that way to me for the rest of the movie.",4,Very enjoyable - I'm glad my husband purchased this for me!,1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,2467,"['was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'recently', 'watched', 'earliest', 'BBC', 'version', 'Emma', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', 'expecting', 'similar', 'acting', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'could', 'tell', 'would', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way', 'was', 'tempted', 'write', 'review', 'finished', 'watching', 'was', 'so', 'pleased', 'What', 'enjoy', 'most', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'cast', 'Elinor', 'was', 'just', 'wonderful', 'One', 'other', 'reviewer', 'commented', 'was', 'made', 'attractive', 'whereas', 'most', 'Elinors', 'other', 'adaptations', 'were', 'made', 'look', 'plain', 'too', 'enjoyed', 'Elinor', 'was', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'truth', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'book', 'Elinor', 'supposed', 'be', 'plain', 'attractive.Marianne', 'was', 'think', 'very', 'good', 'were', 'couple', 'times', 'seemed', 'be', 'top', 'what', 'remember', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'reasonable', 'portrayl.Edward', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Mrs.', 'Jennings', 'was', 'fabulous', 'Misses', 'Steeles', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'thought', 'big', 'improvement', 'later', 'movies', 'Willoughby', 'was', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'audience', 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'be', 'drawn', 'Sir', 'John', 'Middleton', 'outrageous', 'seem', 'fit', 'book', 'remember', 'are', 'two', 'reasons', 'gave', 'adaptation', 'four', 'rather', 'five', 'first', 'were', 'several', 'marked', 'differences', 'dialogue', 'events', 'youngest', 'Miss', 'Dashwood', 'eliminated', 'think', 'unfortunate', 'presence', 'endear', 'Edward', 'audience', 'Elinor', 'Also', 'end', 'story', 'Elinor', 'emotional', 'outburst', 'been', 'eliminated', 'felt', 'THAT', 'was', 'inexcusable', 'omission', 'Elinor', 'so', 'calm', 'story', 'emotions', 'getting', 'better', 'very', 'significant', 'part', 'story', 'were', 'other', 'smaller', 'differences', 'as', 'well', 'still', 'decently', 'faithful', 'even', 'changes.The', 'second', 'reason', 'ending', 'seemed', 'bit', 'awkward', 'sort', 'just', 'fades', 'out', ""n't"", 'feel', 'should', 'end', 'there', 'found', 'unfortunate', 'felt', 'execution', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'whole', 'three', 'hours', 'very', 'last', 'two', 'minutes', 'One', 'other', 'difficulty', 'had', 'affect', 'rating', 'was', 'camera', 'seemed', 'times', 'be', 'unfocused.But', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'very', 'first', 'minute', 'two', 'felt', 'stagy', 'term', 'couple', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'used', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way', 'rest', 'movie']",Sense and Sensibility
1264362,A1Q9IL7O2T6C1S,B002DY9KR0,Amy Smith,"[12, 12]","I had to have this recently retrieved from the vaults Austen adaptation because I try to see every filmed take on her works.  Joanna David truly shines as Elinor.  Madden's Marianne is problematic at first; she seems so thoroughly self-absorbed, that you doubt how her sister can be so attached to her.  Although too much of the dialogue is not true to the novel, the screenplay succeeds well in depicting the sobering effects of genuine emotional suffering in Marianne.  She is genuinely less trite, and much more introspective after her ordeal. Although her looks will always be a draw, the viewer knows that the way has been paved for her to experience the genuine unconditional love which Willoughby's fear of poverty prohibited....It was a joy to see a younger Patricia Routledge in the role of Mrs. Jennings!.....It was however, easier to see Sir John Middleton as a well-respected Shopkeeper of sorts than as a fine country gentleman, although he accurately depicted the warmth and generosity of Austen's creation......The Steele sisters were dead-on; they were as grasping and uncultured as Jane Austen showed us.  We must understand that we can't ""hate on"" Lucy too much.  In that era, lower Middle-Class (and some genuinely Middle-Class) mothers bordered on socially ""prostituting"" their daughters to make up for the lack of a real dowry.  There was such a fear that an unmarried daughter would settle into spinsterhood and further drain a family's meager resources, that mothers (and sometimes fathers) would literally brainwash their daughters into utilizing excessive flattery, and overall catering to the landed gentry as a key weapon in their arsenal to trap a wealthy man.  Such a man could perhaps elevate the standard of living of the gal's entire family!......Not without imperfections, this adaptation of Sense&Sensibility is still worth watching.",3,"Dated style of novel adaptation, but worth watching",1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,1867,"['had', 'have', 'recently', 'retrieved', 'vaults', 'Austen', 'adaptation', 'try', 'see', 'filmed', 'take', 'works', 'Joanna', 'David', 'truly', 'Elinor', 'Madden', 'Marianne', 'problematic', 'first', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'self-absorbed', 'doubt', 'how', 'sister', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'attached', 'too', 'much', 'dialogue', 'not', 'true', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'well', 'depicting', 'sobering', 'effects', 'genuine', 'emotional', 'suffering', 'Marianne', 'genuinely', 'less', 'trite', 'much', 'more', 'introspective', 'ordeal', 'looks', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'draw', 'viewer', 'way', 'been', 'paved', 'experience', 'genuine', 'unconditional', 'love', 'Willoughby', 'fear', 'poverty', 'prohibited', '.It', 'was', 'joy', 'see', 'younger', 'Patricia', 'Routledge', 'role', 'Mrs', 'Jennings', '..It', 'was', 'however', 'easier', 'see', 'Sir', 'John', 'Middleton', 'well-respected', 'Shopkeeper', 'sorts', 'fine', 'country', 'gentleman', 'accurately', 'depicted', 'warmth', 'generosity', 'Austen', 'creation', 'Steele', 'sisters', 'were', 'dead-on', 'were', 'grasping', 'uncultured', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'showed', 'must', 'understand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hate', 'Lucy', 'too', 'much', 'era', 'lower', 'Middle-Class', 'genuinely', 'Middle-Class', 'mothers', 'bordered', 'socially', 'prostituting', 'daughters', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'real', 'dowry', 'was', 'such', 'fear', 'unmarried', 'daughter', 'would', 'settle', 'spinsterhood', 'further', 'drain', 'family', 'meager', 'resources', 'mothers', 'sometimes', 'fathers', 'would', 'literally', 'brainwash', 'daughters', 'utilizing', 'excessive', 'flattery', 'overall', 'catering', 'landed', 'gentry', 'key', 'weapon', 'arsenal', 'trap', 'wealthy', 'man', 'man', 'could', 'perhaps', 'elevate', 'standard', 'living', 'gal', 'entire', 'family', 'Not', 'imperfections', 'adaptation', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'still', 'worth', 'watching']",Sense and Sensibility
1264363,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B002DY9KR0,Andrew Raker,"[8, 8]","Note: Although the Amazon.com heading implies that this is a 2009 adaptation, the 2009 only refers to the DVD release date. In reality, this adaptation is the 1971 BBC adaptation, which is not to be confused with the 1981 BBC adaptation.MY VIEWPOINT:Having read Jane Austen's ""Sense and Sensibility"" twice and having watched the following adaptations of Sense and Sensibility: 1971, 1981, 1996, and 2009, I certainly believe this adaptation captures the intent of Austen's novel better than any of the any other adaptations. Of course, this will create a dated production but hardly a humorless one.This 1971 Giles adaptation captures quite well the personalities of Mrs. Jennings and Lucy Steele. Rare is the adaptation of ""Sense and Sensibility"" in which you sympathize with Mrs. Jennings and believe her to be (despite her gossipy personality) a character with whom other characters can sympathize. Lucy, through her tone of voice and body language, is played as a cunning young lady rather than a naive one when she admits to Elinor that she and Edward have been engaged for years. In other words, Lucy is aware that she is hurting Elinor when she tells her about Edward's engagement. Also, Elinor and Marianne do not seem in this adaptation to be quite as much the embodiment of complete sense and complete sensibility, which is how the 1981 Barron adaptation portrays them.The plot of this 1971 Giles adaptation is very similar to the novel, as are all the adaptations. A few negatives do exist, naturally. Margaret's character is cut, although this might have been expected. Also, the adaptation implies that Radcliffe wrote ""The Castle of Otranto,"" which, in my view, is a careless error.Overall, however, the production kept my attention, certainly better than the 1981 Barron BBC adaptation, in which both Mrs. Jennings and Lucy are like caricatures from a Dickens novel.OVERALL ASSESSMENT:I believe the adaptation is worthy for those who enjoy Austen. For those who prefer a more modernized adaptation, the 2008 Davies adaptation [or even the Thompson adaptation] might be better worth your time.Finally, if you can tolerate the 1981 Baron adaptation [I hated it], this adaptation should not cause your eyes or ears too much pain.",4,Certainly dated but hardly poor,1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,2241,"['Note', 'Amazon.com', 'heading', 'implies', '2009', 'adaptation', '2009', 'only', 'refers', 'DVD', 'release', 'date', 'reality', 'adaptation', '1971', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'not', 'be', 'confused', '1981', 'BBC', 'adaptation.MY', 'VIEWPOINT', 'Having', 'read', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'twice', 'having', 'watched', 'following', 'adaptations', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', '1971', '1981', '1996', '2009', 'certainly', 'believe', 'adaptation', 'intent', 'Austen', 'novel', 'better', 'other', 'adaptations', 'course', 'will', 'create', 'dated', 'production', 'hardly', 'humorless', 'one.This', '1971', 'Giles', 'adaptation', 'quite', 'well', 'personalities', 'Mrs.', 'Jennings', 'Lucy', 'Steele', 'Rare', 'adaptation', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'sympathize', 'Mrs.', 'Jennings', 'believe', 'be', 'gossipy', 'personality', 'character', 'whom', 'other', 'characters', 'can', 'sympathize', 'Lucy', 'tone', 'voice', 'body', 'language', 'played', 'cunning', 'young', 'lady', 'rather', 'naive', 'one', 'when', 'Elinor', 'Edward', 'have', 'been', 'engaged', 'years', 'other', 'words', 'Lucy', 'aware', 'hurting', 'Elinor', 'when', 'Edward', 'engagement', 'Also', 'Elinor', 'Marianne', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'adaptation', 'be', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'embodiment', 'complete', 'sense', 'complete', 'sensibility', 'how', '1981', 'Barron', 'adaptation', 'them.The', 'plot', '1971', 'Giles', 'adaptation', 'very', 'similar', 'novel', 'are', 'adaptations', 'few', 'negatives', 'do', 'exist', 'naturally', 'Margaret', 'character', 'cut', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'expected', 'Also', 'adaptation', 'Radcliffe', 'wrote', 'Castle', 'Otranto', 'view', 'careless', 'error.Overall', 'however', 'production', 'kept', 'attention', 'certainly', 'better', '1981', 'Barron', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'Mrs.', 'Jennings', 'Lucy', 'are', 'like', 'caricatures', 'Dickens', 'novel.OVERALL', 'ASSESSMENT', 'believe', 'adaptation', 'worthy', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Austen', 'who', 'prefer', 'more', 'modernized', 'adaptation', '2008', 'Davies', 'adaptation', '[', 'even', 'Thompson', 'adaptation', ']', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'time.Finally', 'can', 'tolerate', '1981', 'Baron', 'adaptation', '[', 'hated', ']', 'adaptation', 'should', 'not', 'cause', 'eyes', 'ears', 'too', 'much', 'pain']",Sense and Sensibility
1264364,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B002DY9KR0,Byron Kolln,"[3, 3]","Probably the rarest of all TV adaptations of the delightful Jane Austen romance, the 1971 BBC miniseries of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY comes to DVD for the very first time, and is bound to enchant Austen devotees and newcomers alike.  We're probably very lucky to still have it, considering that most of the BBC productions during this period were later wiped from their archive.SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is the story of two sisters, poles apart in their attitude and countenance, but on equal footing when it comes to the follies and foibles of romance.  Forced to move out of their beloved estate Norland after their father's death, the Dashwood sisters Elinor (Joanna David) and Marianne (Ciaran Madden), together with their mother (Isabel Dean), are now expected to live on a drastically reduced income--begrudgingly provided by their half-brother--in a small cottage that has been allotted to them by a distant cousin at Barton Park.  At their new home of Barton Cottage, Marianne meets Willoughby (Clive Francis), a dashing but reckless playboy; whilst Elinor, in turn, awaits infrequent visits from Edward Ferrars (Robin Ellis), her shy brother-in-law.  It's during a fateful trip to London with Mrs Jennings (Patricia Routledge) that both girls discover shattering revelations about their respective would-be beau's.I really cannot understand the amount of reviewers criticising this version; granted it's not as ""slick"" as the modern Jane Austen attempts seen on the BBC and other networks (in that respect we've been greatly spoiled in the last few years), but it still tells the story (in four 45-minute episodes), and the performances on the whole are very solid--sometimes a bit stagey--however this is a problem you'll nevertheless find on most TV programmes of the era.  Screenwriter Denis Constanduros went on to pen the treatment for the BBC's 1972 miniseries of ""Emma"", which is held in high regard by most Austen-philes.Joanna David brings a sweet tranquilness to the role of Elinor, and is beautifully counterbalanced by Ciaran Madden's impossibly romantic, almost feverish Marianne.  Her's is perhaps the most stagebound performance in the whole piece; however let us not forget that Ms Madden was a classically trained actress and had, in the previous year, turned in a lovely Ophelia in a TV version of ""Hamlet"".  Patricia Routledge (social-climbing horror Mrs Bucket herself) is a joy playing warm-hearted Mrs Jennings.

The acting was mostly good- Joanna David was excellent (and quite beautiful) as the sensible Elinor. Patricia Routledge was another standout as Mrs. Jennings. She was absolutely hilarious yet also showed the character's kind nature. Robin Ellis (who you may recognize as Ross Poldark) even had a ""sexed-up"" scene as Edward.Some of the acting/casting was less than perfect, however. Ciaran Madden played Marianne as borderline insane- going into hysterics all the time. Her and Colonel Brandon's storyline wasn't given as much screen time as the Elinor/Edward story so it may feel underdeveloped in comparison. Lucy Steele looks close to 40 and is so obviously evil one wonders how she ever could have charmed Edward. Lady Middleton's actress looks older than her supposed mother, Mrs. Jennings! (Maybe they could have given Patricia Routledge a gray wig to make her look older?) Eliza Williams was oddly made into Colonel Brandon's niece...(so why can't he just tell everyone she's his niece?).A lot of the costumes/hairstyles are quite...70s. And of course, the production values are not up to the standard you may be used to today.

And the British are renown for being ""faithful"" to their dramatization of classic literature.  Although the actors are certainly older than the characters they are portraying, I still liked this version being familiar with so many of those actors from other Masterpiece Theatre and/or BBC productions I've viewed on PBS over the years.This nearly three-hour version features ""salad days"" performances by Joanna David, Patricia Routledge, Robin Ellis and Clive Frances (adversaries in the POLDARK mini-series) and when you factor in that this 1971 mini-series had never aired in this country made it a ""must"" purchase.

I had never watched this particular BBC adaptation, and so was eager to watch it before purchasing it. I found this to be a tepid adaptation of Austen's classic and the worst of all the adaptations. My ranking of the various adaptations of Sense and Sensibility as as follows:The movie version starring Emma Thompson (1995) - there's nothing I dislike about this adaptation:)Sense and Sensibility (BBC, 2008 - haunting score, beautiful cinematography, faithful in most respects, and excellent casting, especially the role of Elinor, which was played by Hattie Morahan)Sense and Sensibility (BBC, 1981 - very faithful to the novel, but the actors are not very appealing)This 1971 BBC adaptation is truly pathetic - the acting by some of the characters seem over the top, and the portrayal of Sir John was truly annoying. The actor playing Willoughby was the least attractive of all the Willoughby's in the various adaptations and I felt he was horribly miscast. The actors playing the sisters, Elinor and Marianne were well-cast, especially the character of Elinor, portrayed by Joanna David, who coincidentally went on to play Elizabeth Bennet's (Jennifer Ehle) aunt in the iconic 1996 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. Joanna David's Elinor is sweet and sensible, and shines in her role. The other notable actor was Patricia Routledge as Mrs Jennings. Routledge went on to attain fame in her role as the pompous Mrs Bucket in ""Keeping Up Appearances"".The feature itself runs about 3 hours, and there are some changes in the dialogue compared to Austen's novel. The props and setting give this production the appearance of being a theater production, and some of the actors appear stilted and awkward in their roles. I think I will still purchase this, if only because I wish to have a collection of all the various adaptations of Austen's works, but I have to say that this is the worst adaptation of Sense and Sensibility compared to the others I have viewed.",3,Lackluster and the weakest of all the adaptations,1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,2108,"['When', 'popped', 'up', 'Netflix', 'queue', 'was', 'excited', ""'m"", 'quite', 'Austen', 'fanatic', 'have', 'most', 'DVDs', 'various', 'adaptations', 'had', 'never', 'watched', 'particular', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'so', 'was', 'eager', 'watch', 'purchasing', 'found', 'be', 'tepid', 'adaptation', 'Austen', 'classic', 'worst', 'adaptations', 'ranking', 'various', 'adaptations', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'movie', 'version', 'starring', 'Emma', 'Thompson', '1995', 'nothing', 'dislike', 'adaptation', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'BBC', '2008', 'haunting', 'score', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'faithful', 'most', 'respects', 'excellent', 'casting', 'especially', 'role', 'Elinor', 'was', 'played', 'Hattie', 'Morahan', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'BBC', '1981', 'very', 'faithful', 'novel', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'appealing', '1971', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'truly', 'pathetic', 'acting', 'characters', 'seem', 'top', 'portrayal', 'Sir', 'John', 'was', 'truly', 'annoying', 'actor', 'playing', 'Willoughby', 'was', 'least', 'attractive', 'Willoughby', 'various', 'adaptations', 'felt', 'was', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'actors', 'playing', 'sisters', 'Elinor', 'Marianne', 'were', 'well-cast', 'especially', 'character', 'Elinor', 'portrayed', 'Joanna', 'David', 'who', 'coincidentally', 'went', 'play', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'aunt', 'iconic', '1996', 'adaptation', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Joanna', 'David', 'Elinor', 'sweet', 'sensible', 'shines', 'role', 'other', 'notable', 'actor', 'was', 'Patricia', 'Routledge', 'Mrs', 'Jennings', 'Routledge', 'went', 'attain', 'fame', 'role', 'pompous', 'Mrs', 'Bucket', 'Keeping', 'Up', 'Appearances', '.The', 'feature', '3', 'hours', 'are', 'changes', 'dialogue', 'compared', 'Austen', 'novel', 'props', 'setting', 'give', 'production', 'appearance', 'being', 'theater', 'production', 'actors', 'appear', 'stilted', 'awkward', 'roles', 'think', 'will', 'still', 'purchase', 'only', 'wish', 'have', 'collection', 'various', 'adaptations', 'Austen', 'works', 'have', 'say', 'worst', 'adaptation', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'compared', 'others', 'have', 'viewed']",Sense and Sensibility
