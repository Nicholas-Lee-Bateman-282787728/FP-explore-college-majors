1453514,A2UGAN36E03HIA,B005C7SXLE,Betty,"[0, 0]",This is another Chuggington DVD for children who like Chuggington trains. Each story has a subtle moral to teach those watching.

1453515,AY12DBB0U420B,B005C7SXLE,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Our little boy (three-years old) just loves any kind of heavy equipment. It's amazing! The highlight of the week is the arrival of the garbage truck coming down our street and picking up the containers. A trip down to the airport to watch planes land and take off brings joy and excitement. A ride on the San Diego Trolley (a light rail system) beats Disneyland.In any case, he loves this kind of stuff. As such, my wife brought a DVD titled ""Chuggington: The Chugger Championship"" home for him to watch. It's a lightweight cartoon about a rail-yard system in a city and a variety of competitions between the trains (each given it's own name). The DVD is divided into about a half dozen smaller stories in which the individually-named trains (called trainees) go through a simple series of activities. I find the stories corny, but mildly amusing, but the movie isn't meant for me. It's meant for a child. The short nature of the individual stories doesn't exceed my child''s attention span, Story follows story and the kid is just glued to watching the TV. It's amazing! In my opinion, the trains are overly animated and the voices are overly acted. No matter. The brightly-colored little trains captivate my kid, and that's what counts. The music is  simple and infectious and the sound on my stereo system is fairly good.We sat down on the couch, I put my arm around the little guy and we watched the entire DVD without the slightest interruption. It had his undivided attention. When it was over, the boy wanted to watch it again. Now, I'd say that was a real successful children's cartoon.Gary Peterson",5,A Real Successful Children's Cartoon!,1320364800,"11 4, 2011",2011,1607,"['little', 'boy', 'three-years', 'old', 'just', 'kind', 'heavy', 'equipment', 'amazing', 'highlight', 'week', 'arrival', 'garbage', 'truck', 'coming', 'down', 'street', 'picking', 'up', 'containers', 'trip', 'down', 'airport', 'watch', 'planes', 'land', 'take', 'off', 'brings', 'joy', 'excitement', 'ride', 'San', 'Diego', 'Trolley', 'light', 'rail', 'system', 'Disneyland.In', 'case', 'kind', 'stuff', 'such', 'wife', 'brought', 'DVD', 'titled', 'Chuggington', 'Chugger', 'Championship', 'home', 'watch', 'lightweight', 'cartoon', 'rail-yard', 'system', 'city', 'variety', 'competitions', 'trains', 'given', 'own', 'name', 'DVD', 'divided', 'half', 'dozen', 'smaller', 'stories', 'individually-named', 'trains', 'called', 'trainees', 'go', 'simple', 'series', 'activities', 'find', 'stories', 'corny', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'meant', 'meant', 'child', 'short', 'nature', 'individual', 'stories', ""n't"", 'exceed', 'child', 's', 'attention', 'span', 'Story', 'story', 'kid', 'just', 'glued', 'watching', 'TV', 'amazing', 'opinion', 'trains', 'are', 'overly', 'animated', 'voices', 'are', 'overly', 'acted', 'matter', 'brightly-colored', 'little', 'trains', 'captivate', 'kid', 'what', 'music', 'simple', 'infectious', 'sound', 'stereo', 'system', 'fairly', 'good.We', 'sat', 'down', 'couch', 'put', 'arm', 'little', 'guy', 'watched', 'entire', 'DVD', 'slightest', 'interruption', 'had', 'undivided', 'attention', 'When', 'was', 'over', 'boy', 'wanted', 'watch', 'again', 'Now', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'real', 'successful', 'children', 'cartoon.Gary', 'Peterson']",Ch: The Chugger Championship

The videos always have a moral to the story which helps teaching him how to play and work with others.,5,Chuggington  Chugger Championship,1321574400,"11 18, 2011",2011,205,"['2', 'year', 'old', 'anything', 'Chuggington', 'Chuggington', 'videos', 'over', 'again', 'videos', 'always', 'have', 'moral', 'story', 'teaching', 'how', 'play', 'work', 'others']",Ch: The Chugger Championship
1453517,A1G60ANYI0HMEU,B005C7SXLE,Jeddy 3,"[19, 19]","I don't know what it is about Chuggington, but my 5-year-old son is ""abso-toot-tootly"" entranced by the adventures of Koko, Brewster, and Wilson. He's got all the videos and frequently begs to watch them. We restrict his screen time, but these videos are nice and short -- 10 minutes each -- and they have a nice innocent quality about them, so I let him watch fairly often.If you're browsing this review, you probably already know Chuggington is basically a Thomas the Tank Engine redux. The key differences are the look of the characters (less ""creepy""/scary than Thomas, in my opinion), and the fact that the lead characters in Chuggington seem to be very young, while most of the Thomas characters seem to be adolescent or older. The three ""trainee"" characters get into adventures, learn valuable lessons, yadda yadda, you know, the usual. But it's well executed and has flashes of humor (particularly in recurring characters like the ridiculous flying superhero, ""Action Chugger"" [not seen in this DVD] and the doddering ""Old Puffer Pete""). The episodes move fast and, all told, I really enjoy sitting down to a Chuggington or two with my happy boy.The adventures in this DVD are:""The Chugger Championship"" -- All the chuggers compete in the annual Chugger Championship to see who is the fastest""Helpful Hodge"" -- Wilson and Koko compete to see who can complete the most ""helpful"" tasks in a day""Cool Wilson"" -- Brewster and Wilson vie to be assistants to the ice-cream train, ""The Great Frostini""""Brewster's Hobby"" -- Brewster the train has a new hobby, ""people-spotting,"" (LOL), and it interferes with his work""Wake Up Wilson"" -- Wilson and Koko stay up very late one night, with near-disastrous results""Koko Pulls It Off"" -- The three trainees face a nerve-wracking test of passenger train-pulling skillsAs of this writing, some can be previewed on the Disney Junior website, so if you're uncertain, check out a sample there.
