But if are such a fan, this is a definite ""must.""The video spans from when they started to form as friends all the way back in middle school, to how they got started as a band, and every single change along the way. There's plenty of ""inside"" footage as well, showing the guys when they're not recording. Sure, some of it's a little over the top and maybe a little too shameless, but it's them. It's the band acting more as friends than just a band, and it's hilarious to be able to see that side. It's not very often that a band is actually willing to show that kind of thing to its fans, I guess.The only part that was a little unfortunate was how short the DVD actually seems to be. I've heard that there are ""extras"" you can find if you click around during the actual DVD, but I haven't done that yet, since it's kind of an inconvenience.Overall, it's a great DVD that really every fan of the band should see, both for the laughs and to know their whole ""story.""",5,"Definitely ""for the fans,"" but no complaints here!",1295481600,"01 20, 2011",2011,1093,"['sort', 'thing', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'A7X', 'core', 'will', 'be', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'here', 'interest', 'are', 'such', 'fan', 'definite', 'must', 'video', 'spans', 'when', 'started', 'form', 'friends', 'way', 'back', 'middle', 'school', 'how', 'got', 'started', 'band', 'single', 'change', 'way', 'plenty', 'inside', 'footage', 'as', 'well', 'showing', 'guys', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'recording', 'Sure', 'little', 'top', 'maybe', 'little', 'too', 'shameless', 'band', 'acting', 'more', 'friends', 'just', 'band', 'hilarious', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'side', 'not', 'very', 'often', 'band', 'actually', 'willing', 'show', 'kind', 'thing', 'fans', 'guess.The', 'only', 'part', 'was', 'little', 'unfortunate', 'was', 'how', 'short', 'DVD', 'actually', 'be', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'are', 'extras', 'can', 'find', 'click', 'actual', 'DVD', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'yet', 'kind', 'inconvenience.Overall', 'great', 'DVD', 'really', 'fan', 'band', 'should', 'see', 'laughs', 'know', 'whole', 'story']",N/A

In my opinion, I loved the music videos, and especially the band commentary, and even the video director commentary.  I wish there was more live performances on there, a good idea would have been a full live show.  But I would give this a 5 star review, but I just hoped A7X would have put out a much longer documentary.  It was great stuff, it was, just not long enough.

I wish more bands would release DVDs like this. There is footage within the documentary dating back to some of their first shows, all the way to the present. There is plenty of humor and laugh out load moments, as well as some heartwarming moments (especially in the ""Seize the Day"" video which makes me cry almost every time I watch it).

However, his reason for doing this was because he didn't want to do what every band did and had just a live performance. Unfortunately though, he didn't make this special either. I went in with an open mind and I do like the documentary until the end because it seems as though they go great into depth from their early beginnings and their first two albums but then it seems as though they completely skip most of anything on City of Evil, the making it that is. They go into depth of their first two and then all of a sudden they're on Warped Tour and Ozzfest and I'm like, ""WTF?"" because it is City of Evil that made them who they are today. But instead they forgot to incorporate anything from the making of that album.I understand you people hating this because it is not a live DVD but if you paid attention to the description in addition to what M. Shadows was saying about the release months in advance, you would've known it wasn't a live dvd. But fact remains, if this is the only footage they had, they should've axed this whole dvd period because there wasn't that much about City of Evil and there were not many live tracks either. A real disappointment but I wouldn't say it is terrible, it just could've been a lot better.",3,Just like M.

So I went over to Avenged Sevenfold's web site, and to my delight was greeted with a promotion for a July 2007 DVD release. Naturally, I assumed this would be a live performance of the City of Evil tour that included some material from A7X's 2003 releaseWaking the Fallen....but that is exactly what All Excess is NOT.Avenged Sevenfold: All Excess is a 156 minute (that's more than 2 and a half hours), 18 chapter documentary that chronicles the band's history all the way back to 1999. You get stories of how the band met, to getting signed, to album recording to touring diaries.Basically, the bulk of Avenged Sevenfold: All Excess is like an Avenged Sevenfold episode of VH1's Behind the Music...a really long episode. An episode that only die-hard fans would stay interested in. Look...the clips are fun, but after 2 hours...most of The Fallen that A7X woke with their recent CDs are soundly sleeping.It sure is puzzling why Avenged Sevenfold decided to give fans this documentary release instead of a nice high quality performance release (like the ones on my Amazon Listmania List of The Best Rock DVDs With High Quality A/V; click on my name above to check out the list). The sound and video are far from high quality on All Excess.The sound is all stereo (no Dolby 5.1 or DTS) and the picture's full screen. This doesn't effect the documentary portion too much, but it's really noticeable (if you have an HD TV and surround system) on the few live performances and videos, which are comprised of:- Beast and the Harlot (live)- Trashed and Scattered (live)- Bat Country (live)- Unholy Confessions (video)- Bat Country (video)- Beast and the Harlot (video)- Seize The Day (video)There are also some ""Outtakes"" and ""Easter Eggs"". Whose idea was Easter Eggs for this release, and let's feed the guy who created them to The Deathbat! Who the heck wants to sit there playing with the remote every which way to find cool material that should just be in the main menu? Man, that's annoying.Overall, Avenged Sevenfold: All Excess was an extremely disappointing release for this fan that would have enjoyed much more a high quality City of Evil live performance DVD that included a smattering of the All Excess documentary stuff as extras.",2,Putting the Fallen Back to Sleep,1185235200,"07 24, 2007",2007,2351,"['other', 'day', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'band', 'put', 'out', 'best', 'Hard', 'Rock', 'release', '2005City', 'Evilwas', 'up', 'So', 'went', 'Avenged', 'Sevenfold', 'web', 'site', 'delight', 'was', 'greeted', 'promotion', 'July', '2007', 'DVD', 'release', 'Naturally', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'live', 'performance', 'City', 'Evil', 'tour', 'included', 'material', 'A7X', '2003', 'releaseWaking', 'Fallen', '.but', 'exactly', 'what', 'Excess', 'NOT.Avenged', 'Sevenfold', 'Excess', '156', 'minute', 'more', '2', 'half', 'hours', '18', 'chapter', 'documentary', 'band', 'history', 'way', 'back', '1999', 'get', 'stories', 'how', 'band', 'met', 'getting', 'signed', 'album', 'recording', 'touring', 'diaries.Basically', 'bulk', 'Avenged', 'Sevenfold', 'Excess', 'Avenged', 'Sevenfold', 'episode', 'VH1', 'Music', 'really', 'long', 'episode', 'episode', 'only', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'would', 'stay', 'interested', 'Look', 'clips', 'are', 'fun', '2', 'hours', 'most', 'Fallen', 'A7X', 'woke', 'recent', 'CDs', 'are', 'soundly', 'sleeping.It', 'sure', 'puzzling', 'why', 'Avenged', 'Sevenfold', 'decided', 'give', 'fans', 'documentary', 'release', 'instead', 'nice', 'high', 'quality', 'performance', 'release', 'ones', 'Amazon', 'Listmania', 'List', 'Best', 'Rock', 'DVDs', 'High', 'Quality', 'A/V', 'click', 'name', 'check', 'out', 'list', 'sound', 'video', 'are', 'far', 'high', 'quality', 'Excess.The', 'sound', 'stereo', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'DTS', 'picture', 'full', 'screen', ""n't"", 'effect', 'documentary', 'portion', 'too', 'much', 'really', 'noticeable', 'have', 'HD', 'TV', 'surround', 'system', 'few', 'live', 'performances', 'videos', 'are', 'comprised', 'Beast', 'Harlot', 'live', 'Trashed', 'Scattered', 'live', 'Bat', 'Country', 'live', 'Unholy', 'Confessions', 'video', 'Bat', 'Country', 'video', 'Beast', 'Harlot', 'video', 'Seize', 'Day', 'video', 'are', 'also', 'Outtakes', 'Easter', 'Eggs', 'Whose', 'idea', 'was', 'Easter', 'Eggs', 'release', 'let', 'feed', 'guy', 'who', 'created', 'Deathbat', 'Who', 'heck', 'sit', 'playing', 'remote', 'way', 'find', 'cool', 'material', 'should', 'just', 'be', 'main', 'menu', 'Man', 'annoying.Overall', 'Avenged', 'Sevenfold', 'Excess', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'release', 'fan', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'more', 'high', 'quality', 'City', 'Evil', 'live', 'performance', 'DVD', 'included', 'smattering', 'All', 'Excess', 'documentary', 'stuff', 'extras']",N/A
