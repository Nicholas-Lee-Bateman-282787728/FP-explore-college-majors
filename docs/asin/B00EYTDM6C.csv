It is not really a slasher/killer movie, yet five people end up getting killed. A few parts dragged on a bit too long, but it was able to keep my interest . Mostly to see how everything would turn out, and I must say, I did not see this ending coming, so that was a big plus.

It supposed to be the perfect romantic getaway where he plans to propose--but then his aggressively obnoxious brother and slutty Russian girlfriend turn up unexpectedly and tensions eventually erupt into violence.  Cottage Country manages exactly one laugh across it's seemingly interminable 92 minute length--a sight gag involving a not quite severed head.  Stars Tyler Labine, Malin Akerman and Lucy Punch have all been amusing elsewhere so the fault is obviously not with the cast but this movie is painfully unfunny and the characters rarely act in ways that are even remotely plausible--one murder leads to another and then another but it never feels like a natural escalation but rather stuff the actors are doing because it says so in the script.

1669757,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B00EYTDM6C,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[1, 1]","If you stuck Very Bad Things and the Great Outdoors into a blender, you'd end up with this Cottage country smoothie.  Todd brings his girlfriend, Cammie to his family cottage in the woods to propose, but is interrupted(during oral sex of course) by his obnoxious brother and his girlfriend.  Tensions rise, brother is killed, and in the comedy-of-errors tradition, Todd and Cammie's attempts to cover up the murder leads to more bodies piling up.As you might guess, the movie is played as black comedy.  And while it's certainly not bad by any means, I just couldn't help thinking the whole time how similar the movie is to Very Bad Things.  The whole premise and tone are similar, but there are a few things that seem to be lifted directly from that film.  The three biggest examples would be, A) a character stating and insisting that a Jew needs to be buried with all of their body parts.  B) Cammie is essentially the same as the Cameron Diaz character from VBT, as the nutzo bride to be that will stop and absolutely nothing(murder included) to make sure her perfect wedding isn't spoiled.  And C)  even the ending is very close to the VBT ending.I mean, I know lots of films bear similarities to each other, but this really has a deja vu vibe going on.  All in all it isn't so bad though, especially if you like your comedy dark, dark, dark.",3,The Great Outdoors....With A Body Count!,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,1347,"['stuck', 'Very', 'Bad', 'Things', 'Great', 'Outdoors', 'blender', ""'d"", 'end', 'up', 'Cottage', 'country', 'smoothie', 'Todd', 'girlfriend', 'Cammie', 'family', 'cottage', 'woods', 'propose', 'interrupted', 'oral', 'sex', 'course', 'obnoxious', 'brother', 'girlfriend', 'Tensions', 'rise', 'brother', 'killed', 'comedy-of-errors', 'tradition', 'Todd', 'Cammie', 'attempts', 'cover', 'up', 'murder', 'more', 'bodies', 'piling', 'up.As', 'might', 'guess', 'movie', 'played', 'black', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'not', 'bad', 'means', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'whole', 'time', 'how', 'similar', 'movie', 'Very', 'Bad', 'Things', 'whole', 'premise', 'tone', 'are', 'similar', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'lifted', 'directly', 'film', 'three', 'biggest', 'examples', 'would', 'be', 'A', 'character', 'stating', 'insisting', 'Jew', 'be', 'buried', 'body', 'parts', 'B', 'Cammie', 'essentially', 'same', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'character', 'VBT', 'nutzo', 'bride', 'be', 'will', 'stop', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'murder', 'included', 'make', 'sure', 'perfect', 'wedding', ""n't"", 'spoiled', 'C', 'even', 'ending', 'very', 'close', 'VBT', 'ending.I', 'mean', 'know', 'lots', 'films', 'bear', 'similarities', 'other', 'really', 'deja', 'vu', 'vibe', 'going', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'especially', 'like', 'comedy', 'dark', 'dark', 'dark']","Cottage Country (2013) [ Blu-Ray, Reg.A/B/C Import - Denmark ]"

She has discovered the engagement ring he has hidden and knows what is coming. Alas, the family cottage is shared by his overly crude brother Sal (Dan Petronijevic) and foreign, off and on girlfriend Masha (Lucy Punch). Cammie wants them gone. Todd confronts Sal and drives an ax between their relationship leading to what could have been a fairly decent dark comedy.While there were funny scenes, the humor quality was uneven. It couldn't maintain the level of interest. Sal, was not only unlikeable to his brother and GF, he was made unlikeable to the audience. Dov (Benjamin Ayres) should have added to the humor, instead added to the boredom. They needed a colorful character to replace him. Likewise all the support crowd was fairly lame.Okay rental at best.

When Cammie finds out she has one solution, kill his girlfriend as well and no one will ever know. The plan is perfect until they return to the cabin and see a party happening...with guests invited by his brother. I was looking forward to this one mainly because the slasher- comedy movie Tucker and Dale vs Evil was so great I was hoping it would be like that. This did have funny parts in this but overall this wasn't nearly as funny as Tucker and Dale was. Much like that one though this is a very dark comedy and you laugh at things you shouldn't laugh at but the problem for me was that even though the actions were way over the top the actors seemed to play the movie straight. This little aspect made the movie lose some of the laughs that it could have gotten. Comparing this to Tucker and Dale isn't fair but that is the type of movie it is and is not as good as that one. Overall, disappointing but mainly because of my expectations. Not as funny as I was expecting.
