I looked forward to this movie coming out because it seemed like a great story-line that would touch anyone's heart, however, after watching it, I didn't get that feel good feeling. It was an average movie at best and nothing special. It seemed like it was cheaply done and poorly written overall. I was expecting so much more from it after watching the trailer. Don't get me wrong. It is not a terrible move. It is alright to watch during a boring afternoon with the family and could be used to talk to children about giving back and not being selfish. If this was directed by the same person who did RUDY he must have forgotten a few things since doing that great movie.",3,An overall average feel good movie.
