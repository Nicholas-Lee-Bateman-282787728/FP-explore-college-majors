1026924,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000JJRYDS,B. E Jackson,"[2, 3]","Don't expect a quality suspense with this one.  Just... don't, haha.Expect one of the most predictable storylines you can imagine.  Two kids and their stepmom are trapped inside a car somewhere in Africa because three lions just will NOT leave them alone.Every time they try to leave the car the lions are waiting in the weeds for them.  Do lions *really* treat people this way?  I don't think so.  I think in real life they don't even care about humans unless they feel like they're being threatened.The poor little boy had to spend two whole nights without getting the chance to use the bathroom!  Feel for him.In one spot, the driver of the car actually took his keys with him while taking the little boy to the bathroom, so an unnecessary search for the keys had to take place after the driver was killed graphically.  D'oh!I can't remember why the father didn't tag along for the ride, but it doesn't matter.The three people trapped in the car try the most predictable means of chasing away the lions, but none of them work.  What a clumsy driver the stepmom is too.  VERY clumsy.  Silly girl.  You're not supposed to drive between trees and over cliffs- you're supposed to stay on the dirt road.  We even have dirt roads in America!  She should have known what dirt roads look like.Anyway, the stepmom and the daughter HATE each other.  The daughter constantly finds ways to criticize anything she doesn't like about the woman.  She really needed to grow up though.  Seriously, we all act that way towards our step parents (even *I* do it sometimes -as an adult- and feel embarrassed about it later) but this girl was *really* hard on her stepmom.  She was just trying her best to please and protect the kids.  Completely unfair.I don't think she was technically a stepmom- more like the girls father's girlfriend by that point.Anyway, the father eventually finds an Australian man who doesn't even WANT to help the poor guy find his family.  He changes his mind when there's talk of giving him anything he wants though.  That always helps.Predictable storyline, and a surprising amount of blood.  That's what this film is all about.

But these films have always fascinated me, and even if the film isn't all that great I still give it a chance. This film looks like a great film if you go by cover alone, plus it states that it is inspired by true events which boost interest. Those two things alone have my attention, but it all so hypes the film up. When watched with an open mind it still leaves you with mixed feelings.Director Darrell Roodt who also co wrote this film with Jeff Wadlow, and Beau Bauman creates a cool little tension filled [at times] movie that is an over all enjoyable film. The story is all about a family and a guide who are attacked by a pack of lions and are stuck off road in a jeep. Of course from here we have a film full of pretty realistic kills and some pretty good thrills. The writers, director, and producers of this film obviously went into this trying to make a really good movie, and on some levels they have truly succeeded. The only real faults within this movie are some of the characters.Carly Schroeder plays her role very well but it is her character that truly hurts this movie. She plays Jessica Newman who is the most annoying character I think I have ever seen in a film ever. You may be reading that and think that I am exaggerating, but I promise you I am not. You really will be wishing for this teenage girl to literally be thrown to the lions, as bad as that sounds it would have elevated this film to classic status in my mind. Conner Dowds's character is quite the opposite, but the problem here is in the performance. I realize he is just a kid, so to that extent it isn't horrible but other kids have done much better. Bridget Moynahan on the other hand as the step mother of the kids is great in her role, I particularly like when she finally gets on to Carly's character. She plays the role brilliantly and like others have said she does look a little like Sandra Bullock. Peter Weller is just as good as the father who can not be there to help his family. In fact everyone else in the film is very believable [see Jamie] and do a great job with this film.This film would be perfect for a day you have just laying around the house.

The very first kill was the most unsetteling to me. It came almost out of no where but it was all set up to happen.A stepmother, two bratty children, and a guide go on a safarri expedition while the father is at work. Since this movie is about the survival of the family, it should be no surprise that the guide is the first person to face his mortality... and it truly is a shame. Simply put, he died so a kid could go #2. And his death sequence was beyond mortifying to me. It seriously had me freaking out... as it was HIGHLY intense.After his death, the stepmother and the kids are stranded and hopeful that the husband will come out in search of them while they stay in the car. Unfortunately, that is the only smart thing they do through the movie... as tension between the kids and their new stepmother boils over at the most inopprotune of moments. The lions are freaky... but when they are taken out by various ""would be rescuers"" it is so obviously fake (which... is ok cause I wouldn't want real lions to die for a campy film like this) and the action to be seen is when the lions are stalking.Although intense, this film is sadly bogged downward by the poor acting. Only two people offered intersting characters... and wouldn't you know it... their fates are pretty much sealed from the get go. All of the main characters are either overplaying it or just phoning it in. But... do not despair... this is not a film that is meant to impress with solid acting chops. This is one for the survival film buffs... mother nature takes a lethal swipe at mankind in this thriller.

1026940,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000JJRYDS,Jason,"[2, 3]","Hoping to form a bond between his two young children and his new bride, engineer Tom Newman (Peter Weller) takes his kids - teenage daughter Jessica (Carly Schroeder) and young son David (Connor Dowds) - and his new bride Amy (Bridget Moynahan) on an African safari.  While off-roading with the tour guide in a zebra-painted safari truck, the bumpy terrain dislodges some of the warthog from the previous night's meal causing David's IBS to flair up.  The tour guide decides it's a good decision to let 65lb David drop a deuce in the bush nearly 50 yards from the truck in the middle of lion country.  Yeah, because lions don't single out the weak for their prey.  Either it's the tour guide's first day or he's retarded, but things don't go as he plans.  What follows is nothing more than Cujo on steroids, as Jessica and the kids struggle to survive, with predictable and boring step-mamma-drama, while Tom employs the help of a local hunter, Crawford (Jamie Bartlett).First and foremost, if you're looking for a man vs. lion movie, it's called The Ghost and the Darkness.  That is not up for debate.Since this probably falls in the horror genre, I suppose we should get the following out of the way: cell phones don't work, moronic choices abound, no nudity, and Jessica can't drive...but that's mainly because women can't drive.  I digress.  Suffice to say, the movie loses incredible steam because the tension between step-mother and daughter is tedious, the little boy nearly gets heat stroke after one wittle day in the hot sun, and the only interesting characters get little screen time (except when Crawford is massaging and smelling a clump of lion scat in his left hand for an obscene amount of time).It's not a bad film, but there aren't a lot of aspects that standout.  The few that did are Lion-Vision(tm), the lion-kebab, and the ""African Picnic.""As far as movies about lions killing humans, it's second best.  Out of two movies.

1026942,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000JJRYDS,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 4]","Tom Newman (Peter Weller) brings his two children and his new, younger wife, Amy (Bridget Moynahan) to Africa to spend some time with them while he's working on an African dam project.  His daughter, Jessica (Carly Schroeder), is upset about her parents' divorce, and wants nothing to do with Amy.  Hoping to form a bond between them, Newman suggests that his daughter and new wife, along with his son, David (Connor Dowds), take a ride through a game reserve on their way to the lodge where they will spend the rest of their vacation while he finishes up on some work.While touring the reserve, young David needs to use the bathroom.  The guide and David leave the safety of the SUV they are riding in so that David can do a little ""paper work"" in the bush.  With the tour guide protecting him with a rifle, David commences to relieve himself.  Unfortunately for the group, though, David's moving problem has them stopped in the middle of a group of starving lions.  The lions make an attempt on catching David, but the guide manages to hold them off long enough for the young boy to make it back to the truck.  The guide isn't so lucky and is violently killed by the beasts.  This leaves Amy, Jessica, and David alone to swelter in the African heat and do their best in order to survive until someone can find them.Meanwhile, Tom has made it to the lodge and immediately tries to start a search and rescue mission.  Unfortunately the rangers at the lodge can't assist him until daylight.  He's put into contact with a local hunter/tracker named Crawford (Jamie Bartlett) who refuses to help Tom at first, but eventually gives in when a payment is offered for his services.From here, the film bounces from extremely tense (and well-played) moments where the lions attempt to get their paws on the Newman clan to long and drawn out moments of dialogue primarily between Amy and Jessica.  In an attempt to keep the story interesting, the three primary players are put into situations ranging from trying to make an escape in the vehicle once they find the keys to making friends with poachers.The film struggled to hold my interest during its run.  It quickly became a victim of its own devices.  There have been many better films made where the bulk of the action centers on a small group of individuals in an isolated situation as is the case in ""Prey.""  ""The Descent"" and ""Jaws"" immediately come to mind.  However, in ""Prey,"" having the group pinned down in a vehicle and making a number of risky and, in at least one situation, ridiculous choices does nothing to keep the story interesting.The primary subplot of the film, the friction between Amy and Jessica, is instantly predictable and offers nothing to add to the film.The cast doesn't do a terrible job.  Moynahan is sufficient as the stepmother who takes on the task of being a hero while stranded in the bush.  Weller doesn't have much to do in this film except become angry for a bit and then desperate to save his family.  The children are okay, but both of them visit the overacting department a bit too often for my tastes.  If I had to pick out one shining star in the film, I'd have to say it was Jamie Bartlett.  His character is about the most interesting thing in the film, and adds a bit of much needed humor to the story as well.The special effects are dodgy at times.  The CGI blood is ridiculous, and fails to rise above similar effects that can be found on SyFy on Saturday nights.In summary, ""Prey"" has some wonderful moments that almost make it better than it really is.  In the end, however, it is nothing more than a B-movie that doesn't even fall into the ""so terrible it's funny"" category.

Moynaham ofI, Robotfame, as the stepmom saddled with 2 bratty kids is very believable and will often remind you in looks and speech of Sandra Bullock.  The oldest child is very effective in her role, but her character will, forgive the pun, eat away at your nerves to the point where you want Moynaham to simply kick the broken down jeep's door open and feed her to the damn lions.

Peter Weller, theRobocop Trilogyand recent villain on TV's24 - Season Five, as the dad is reliable as always and he's always been a very underrated actor.

They are that riveting and horrific.  I promise you that you will not forget them.  There are enough ""rest"" scenes in the film between the lion attacks and they are used well.  The character interactions between the stepmom and the oldest resentful stepdaughter are believable no matter how ill-timed they are.  Imagined being trapped with someone that you hate.  It happens and it is played out believably here.  The majority of this film takes place in the broken down tourist Jeep the ranger takes off-roading at the family's expense for some extra ""fun.""This ""trapped in a car"" scenario is rather remincent of Stephen King'sCujo, an excellent film, wherein Dee Wallace Stone is trapped in her car with her sick son by their rapid family dog, Cujo, on a blistering hot day.  They spend a good 2/3rds of that film trying to get from the car in the driveway to the inside of the house and away from the dog before they die in the car from the heat and lack of water just as they do in the film ""Prey.""  ""Prey"" focuses on that same claustrophobic panic and we feel it as an audience.  It is very effectively communicated thanks to good direction and acting.The plot of ""Prey"" has some significant holes and they can be very annoying, but panic and stupidity drives most of these people to do what they do.  It is, however, VERY hard to believe that an experienced ranger would take a family off-roading in a very dangerous area to stop and have a kid do #2 in a lion-infested area.  If you are willing to suspend your disbelief for that scene which sets up the story, then the rest is going to go down fairly easily.I highly recommend this film, flaws and all, for the intense action sequences, skilled direction, and the overall good acting by the major players.  This film rarely lets up on the suspense and you will remember it long after seeing it.",4,Prey Will Having You Praying . . .

1026951,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B000JJRYDS,trashcanman,"[3, 5]","""Prey"" is a horror film that runs straight down the middle.  It borrows elements from other films, doesn't take any chances, but delivers some solid suspense, violence, and scares.  Horror veterans won't see anything they haven't seen before done better, but I think casual fans looking for a thrill will find it here.  This may not be saying much, but it's the second best killer lion flick I've ever seen.The story is this: two kids go on a safari with their new stepmom, guide goes offroad, kid has to go to the bathroom, lions eat the incompetent guide, guide had the keys to the landrover, now they're screwed.  But isn't that similar to an episode of ""The Simpsons""?  Yes.  Yes it is.  Thanks for noticing.  And isn't being trapped in a vehicle with kids in an isolated area with no supplies and a murderous beast stalking you the plot toCujo?  Mmm-hmmm.  And afterThe Ghost and the Darknessdon't you think they've pretty much done what they can do with a movie about killer lions?  I'd say so.  But then again, originality has never really been the hallmark of the horror genre.  In fact the lack of new material is the only really large complaint I can level against ""Prey"".  Then again, it is tagged with the annoying ""based on true events"" tag so I guess you can overlook the similarities to other films if you want to.  It's very competently directed and only real lions were used and they were used effectively.  No CG to draw attention to itself or phony puppets to laugh at.  Well done.Now I have a few minor complaints to log in as well.  First, haven't we seen enough stories about stepmothers bonding with the teenage stepdaughters who hate them?  Also, if I see one more survival horror film where they get the vehicle working and then immediately crash it after they are scot-free I'm going to freak.Eden Lakegot away with it, but it still bugs the hell out of me and I'm drawing the line now: NO MORE!  Stupidity is a tenet of horror protagonists for some reason, but I think that particular element has run it's course.  This one pushes it pretty far.  Other then that, I think this flick was pretty realistically done.  I'd also like to thank the director for not having a subplot about not being able to get the cellphones to work.  Seems like every modern survival horror film has to make a huge show of how the cell-phones aren't charged or have them checking for a signal and giving constant reports about having ""no bars"".  It's a movie, I will happily accept that this is a cell-phone free alternate universe if it will save 15 minutes of screen time spent playing with cell phones.  Again, thanks.Violence, suspense, harrowing horror, stupid protagonists; yup, this is a by-the-numbers fright flick.  But it's worth a look if you have a fear of lions -which admittedly are one of the most intimidating creatures on God's green Earth- or are just looking for something to kill an hour and a half of your time.  If you haven't seen it all, this will likely be a very effective thriller.  It's definitely no ""Ghost and the Darkness"", but it's not half bad for such a low-profile film.
