I thought Vanessa Williams looked stunning as the jaded dance instructor who had sworn off men till an incredibly handsome new custodian walks into the studio and straight into her heart. The custodian is played wonderfully by newcomer (as an actor that is) chayanne. His kind, shy, boyish portrayal is engaging and likable and a joy to watch. Likewise almost all the supporting roles are well done. So why only four stars? You'll notice I said ""almost"" all the supporting roles were well done. There are two reasons. Kris Kristofferson (for the most part) and Joan Plowright. We'll start with Kristofferson who is badly miscast here. So much so that his crusty, surly, out of character portrayal nearly ruins the mood. At least everytime he's on camera. He's just plain awful. Maybe even embarrassing here. I never thought much of him as an actor and after seeing this movie I thought even less of him. Then there's Joan Plowright who is supposedly a great actress right? Wrong! Would a great actress overact the way she does here? What was she thinking. Better still why didn't the director do his job and bring her in line. I think sometimes these people become legends in their own minds and it rubs off on those around them and they think ""she must be good.....who am I to tell her she's off""! Well anyway the movie works in spite of them. There's one very memorable scene where Williams almost dances out of her dress that will have men drooling. It's a very very hot scene. Look I hate to dance but just give me Vanessa Williams in a nurses outfit that is falling off and I'll be the first one on the dance floor doing a very bad John Travolta immitation!

If you're going to display a ballroom competition, at LEAST get it right! The comp they showed is nothing like a real competition, you get nothing of the real feel of what ballroom is. Someone looking to get hooked on the dance style will be sorely disappointed if that's what they're expecting. There's a lot more to it than this movie shows. More to the point, I'd like to see a ballroom movie that employs REAL ballroom dancers, people who actually know what they're doing. That could bring a whole new kind of charisma to the screen.

11487,A3AYDEWU1EPF15,0767812387,Luis Hernandez,"[37, 38]","While its' premise can be a bit boring at times, &quot;Dance With Me&quot; is an entertaining film that will give the viewers a glimpse of the competitive world of ballroom dancing. Making his American feature film debut is Puerto Rican singing superstar Chayanne, whose previous claim to fame has been his successful recording career in the Spanish-speaking world. While Chayanne has acted in only one movie prior to &quot;Dance With Me&quot; (the 1994 Puerto Rican film &quot;Linda Sara,&quot; which co-starred Dayanara Torres, a former Miss Universe who is now married to Latin singing-superstar Mark Anthony) his role as Rafael, a recent Cuban emigre in Texas is somewhat believable. He doesn't possess the accent or the personality of a native Cuban, and I don't understand why the producers didn't make his character Puerto Rican instead.Vanessa L. Williams is wonderful as usual, and her dancing will blow you away. Both her and Chayanne add sex appeal and passion to this somewhat slow, sometimes sappy film. Kris Kristofferson is great as Rafael's father, however I did feel that Joan Plowright's character was out of place. The film does convey a Latin feel to it, and the film's soundtrack will validate this as many Latino singer stars such as Gloria Estefan and Thalia lend their musical talents to it.It was an added bonus to see both singing superstars Albita and the DLG perform live in the film. Albita, Cuba's hottest export in recent years, mixes her usual blend of salsa with traditional Cuban rhythms. DLG, the Puerto Rican-Dominican salsa group are also incredible, and their performances are an added bonus in this film.Director Randa Hines (&quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot;) does a great job in keeping the cast and story together. as the pride of San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico, Chayanne can rest assure that he will have a bright career ahead of him due to his good looks and personality (he is already the official spokesperson for the Puerto Rico's Tourism). Vanessa Williams will blow you away with her dancing, and the film will give you a craving for Latin music and dancing.

It's entertaining enough, but you'd expect the whole point of it to be contained in the title. At ninety minutes, it would have been a high energy look at hot Latin dancing. Instead, it runs over two hours, and for some reason, devotes a lot time to a predictable, unoriginal story line.Puerto Rican heart throb Chayanne, whose real first name is Elmer, plays a young Cuban named Rafael. When his mother dies, he contacts a man named John [Kris Kristofferson] in Texas who his mom always claimed was the father. Rafael is the result of a ship board romance, and while John invites Rafael to come to America, he does not know it's his son who will arrive.Rafael becomes the maintenance man at John's run down ballroom dance school. There he meets gorgeous, talented and intelligent Ruby Sinclair [Vanessa L. Williams], who is an instructor. It's love at first sight for Rafael, but Ruby has been burned by love once too often and has an illegitimate son to prove it.The school is peopled by odd ball characters, who are practicing for a national championship in Las Vegas. They spend much more time batting uninspired one-liners back and forth than they do preparing for the contest. The exceptions are Ruby and one other woman.Will John follow through on his plan to close the school? How will he react when he finds out Rafael is his son? When will Ruby get over her pride and fall for Rafael? Will our Cuban hero ever get to dance? Will he ever stop smiling?The predictable story might have been fine if its delivery had been energetic. Director Randa Haines chose to keep the pace of it slow, which conflicts with the dance sequences. They make the movie come alive. There are three show stopping numbers, and for someone like me who likes dancing, they are worth the price of the video rental. Otherwise, the only interesting bit to me was watching Rafael and Ruby come to terms with each other over what defines dancing. Both their styles are terrific, but his is of the streets, while hers is of the classroom. This is the first movie I've seen which shows that two people may be dancers, but that doesn't mean they can dance with each other.One great dance routine comes early in the movie. Rafael burns up the dance floor at a Latin disco in Texas. The rest come at the end during the ballroom competition, where couples doing the Rumba, the Samba, the Cha Cha and the Tango show us couch potatoes that we may be missing a lot in life. There's about an hour between the first and last dance numbers, and this is where the movie really drags.",3,Dance romance's beat a little uneven,1017187200,"03 27, 2002",2002,2622,"['people', 'who', 'made', 'Dance', 'Me', 'missed', 'beat', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'enough', ""'d"", 'expect', 'whole', 'point', 'be', 'contained', 'title', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'high', 'energy', 'look', 'hot', 'Latin', 'dancing', 'Instead', 'two', 'hours', 'reason', 'lot', 'time', 'predictable', 'unoriginal', 'story', 'line.Puerto', 'Rican', 'heart', 'throb', 'Chayanne', 'real', 'first', 'name', 'Elmer', 'young', 'Cuban', 'named', 'Rafael', 'When', 'mother', 'dies', 'man', 'named', 'John', '[', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', ']', 'Texas', 'who', 'mom', 'always', 'claimed', 'was', 'father', 'Rafael', 'result', 'ship', 'board', 'romance', 'John', 'Rafael', 'come', 'America', 'not', 'know', 'son', 'who', 'will', 'arrive.Rafael', 'maintenance', 'man', 'John', 'run', 'down', 'ballroom', 'dance', 'school', 'gorgeous', 'talented', 'intelligent', 'Ruby', 'Sinclair', '[', 'Vanessa', 'L.', 'Williams', ']', 'who', 'instructor', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Rafael', 'Ruby', 'been', 'burned', 'love', 'once', 'too', 'often', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'prove', 'it.The', 'school', 'peopled', 'odd', 'ball', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'practicing', 'national', 'championship', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'spend', 'much', 'more', 'time', 'batting', 'uninspired', 'one-liners', 'back', 'forth', 'do', 'preparing', 'contest', 'exceptions', 'are', 'Ruby', 'one', 'other', 'woman.Will', 'John', 'follow', 'plan', 'close', 'school', 'How', 'will', 'react', 'when', 'out', 'Rafael', 'son', 'When', 'will', 'Ruby', 'get', 'pride', 'fall', 'Rafael', 'Will', 'Cuban', 'hero', 'ever', 'get', 'dance', 'Will', 'ever', 'stop', 'smiling', 'predictable', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'delivery', 'had', 'been', 'energetic', 'Director', 'Randa', 'Haines', 'chose', 'keep', 'pace', 'slow', 'dance', 'sequences', 'make', 'movie', 'come', 'alive', 'are', 'three', 'show', 'stopping', 'numbers', 'someone', 'who', 'dancing', 'are', 'price', 'video', 'rental', 'Otherwise', 'only', 'interesting', 'bit', 'was', 'watching', 'Rafael', 'Ruby', 'come', 'terms', 'other', 'what', 'dancing', 'styles', 'are', 'terrific', 'streets', 'hers', 'classroom', 'first', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'two', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'dancers', ""n't"", 'mean', 'can', 'dance', 'other.One', 'great', 'dance', 'routine', 'early', 'movie', 'Rafael', 'up', 'dance', 'floor', 'Latin', 'disco', 'Texas', 'rest', 'come', 'end', 'ballroom', 'competition', 'where', 'couples', 'doing', 'Rumba', 'Samba', 'Cha', 'Cha', 'Tango', 'show', 'couch', 'potatoes', 'may', 'be', 'missing', 'lot', 'life', 'hour', 'first', 'last', 'dance', 'numbers', 'where', 'movie', 'really']",N/A

I had no idea Vanessa Williams was that good a ballroom dancer, let alone such a fine actress and a stunning woman. Chayenne, not the best actor around, is nevertheless somewhat sweet and charming but he cannot hold a candle to the firepower of the professional ballroom dancers. The scenes where the competitions take place are fabulous, using real ballroom dance champions, doing real, not bastardized, ballroom dancing.The story-line behind the dancing (and it *is* behind the dancing) is a nice one but predictable. Chayenne is a Cuban immigrant on a trip to meet his American father (Chris Christofferson), who doesn't know Chayenne is his son, fathered by him in an old love affair aboard a cruise ship. Chayenne arrives to do handyman work at Christofferson's dance studio and the latter soon realizes Chayenne is his son, which creates tension between them. To me, that aspect of the film was padding and could easily have been omitted in favor of more dancing.The better parts have to do with a clash in dance style between Vanessa Williams' character and Chayenne's but they work it out and it becomes great fun to watch the two free-form dancing together, and dancing with others at small night clubs.Truth to tell, I wish there were far more ballroom dance movies of high quality like this one. The other ballroom dance movies are built more around love stories, such as ""Strictly Ballroom"". ""Shall We Dance"", with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez is also good but doesn't have the professional spark that ""Dance With Me"" reveals.(Not that this has much to do with ballroom dance, but I am still waiting for some hugely talented person to release a high-quality DVD of just Fred Astaire's dances. JUST the dances with dates, partners, name of film; no interviews, no talking, just his dances, with and without partners.

You can't put it away. I'm wearing my CD out already (if it's possible) and will probably have to buy another. I haven't stopped watching it since I bought it. Vanessa was always a good actress to me but my focus is--of course--on the sexy, wonderful smiling Chayanne. His performance is so poignant, you hurt for him as things don't seem to work out as he'd hoped with his father and with Ruby. Yes, the movie is somewhat predictable but still I hang on to every word.I vaguely remember him from the 100 most beautiful people in the People Magazine in the early nineties but had no idea who he was at the time. This movie introduced me to the latin music world and wow!!!! What a fun world!! I don't understand a lick of the language but who cares! It's awesome. The white haired singer in the movie--WHO IS SHE??!! I keep returning to that scene where the room just dances together to her song. I've never seen anything like this. I can't say enough about this movie. Although it is sad that it didn't get the credit it should have. I remember the movie coming out but wasn't much interested until a friend introduced it to me only a week ago.Now I'm ordering two of Chayanne's CDs and the Dance with me soundtrack. The song with Chayanne and Vanessa is so romantic and sweet. I agree--there's something almost innocent about this movie. And in a world where everything is so overtly obvious, both sexually and violently, this is a movie that won't be far from me. It makes me believe love is possible outside the racial barriers (I'm an AA woman by the way). I want my own Rafael! LOLThere's only ONE thing I'm not happy about and that is this DVD doesn't have the extra features that are out these days. It's obvious that there are a lot of scenes that were pulled from the final cut. I'd have loved to see them practicing the dancing, cast interviews, all the little things we love about purchasing the DVD version of a movie.

If you like Latin music, you'll enjoy the music and dancing, especially the night club scene where Rafael and Ruby dance with a bunch of other club goers.  The two lead actors are beautiful.  Cheyenne especially has the most infectious smile.  Then there's Kris Kristofferson with his grizzled tough guy act which is fun to see.  There's also lots of other quirky characters and some titillating scenes. As with most &#34;dance&#34; movies, the plot is a bit thin and the ending was pretty bad, with Vanessa William's character turning into a zombie, but overall, it's very enjoyable to watch.",5,Good Fun,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,669,"['fun', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'Definitely', 'not', 'one', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'like', 'Latin', 'music', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'music', 'dancing', 'especially', 'night', 'club', 'scene', 'where', 'Rafael', 'Ruby', 'dance', 'bunch', 'other', 'club', 'goers', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'beautiful', 'Cheyenne', 'especially', 'most', 'infectious', 'smile', 'Then', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'grizzled', 'tough', 'guy', 'act', 'fun', 'see', 'also', 'lots', 'other', 'quirky', 'characters', 'titillating', 'scenes', 'most', '34', 'dance', '34', 'movies', 'plot', 'bit', 'thin', 'ending', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Vanessa', 'William', 'character', 'turning', 'zombie', 'overall', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch']",N/A

What happened to me next would surprise even my closest friend...I found myself spinning and gyrating around my living room with a fantasy partner, fully inspired to recharge my dance roots. Dance With Me ignited the passion for Latin dance that I'd buried long ago!  I replayed scenes over and over again.  I am now searching for a great dance class and purchased 3 Latin-saturated CDs, including the soundtrack to the motion picture ""Salsa"" (some of you may remember that from the 80's).The trailer for this movie promises a steamy and sensual love story.  While sensual, I don't think I would use the word `steamy'.  It is mildly sensual with a touch of innocence.  Vanessa L. Williams (Ruby) and Chayanne (Rafael) do a great job playing off of one another.  I couldn't have hand-picked a better pair myself.  Much of the story line is predictable, but all in all, a very light-hearted romance with a bit of humor thrown in for good measure. A good watch; at least rent it.You'd be surprised the things you will find when you have nothing better to do!",4,May I Have This Dance?,1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,1233,"['bought', 'DVD', 'clearance', 'sale', 'let', 'set', 'entertainment', 'center', 'months', 'one', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'when', 'had', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'popped', 'player', 'What', 'happened', 'next', 'would', 'surprise', 'even', 'closest', 'friend', 'found', 'spinning', 'gyrating', 'living', 'room', 'fantasy', 'partner', 'fully', 'inspired', 'recharge', 'dance', 'roots', 'Dance', 'Me', 'ignited', 'passion', 'Latin', 'dance', ""'d"", 'buried', 'long', 'ago', 'replayed', 'scenes', 'over', 'again', 'am', 'now', 'searching', 'great', 'dance', 'class', 'purchased', '3', 'Latin-saturated', 'CDs', 'including', 'soundtrack', 'motion', 'picture', 'Salsa', 'may', 'remember', '80', '.The', 'trailer', 'movie', 'steamy', 'sensual', 'love', 'story', 'sensual', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'use', 'word', 'steamy', 'mildly', 'sensual', 'touch', 'innocence', 'Vanessa', 'L.', 'Williams', 'Ruby', 'Chayanne', 'Rafael', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'hand-picked', 'better', 'pair', 'Much', 'story', 'line', 'predictable', 'very', 'light-hearted', 'romance', 'bit', 'humor', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'good', 'watch', 'least', 'rent', 'it.You', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'things', 'will', 'find', 'when', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do']",N/A
