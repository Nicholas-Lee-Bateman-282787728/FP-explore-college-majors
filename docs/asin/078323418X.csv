It's a movie about love, friendship, marriage, betrayal, and forgiveness. There are some movies that depict African-American/'black' Americans as people you shouldn't befriend. Well, this isn't one of them. This movie also shows that there are different types of women and men, so it makes you keep an open mind. The problem I have with this movie is in the special features where the actors are being interviewed about the film. Harold Perrineau (sorry if I didn't spell his name well; he was mercutio in Romeo and Juliet). He said marriage is for Americans, that it's an American tradition--what about the rest of the world?!

All the college friends such as work-mad Jordan Armstrong (Nia Long), the sly and lascivious Q (Terrence Howard) and the ever-worrying Julian Murch (Harold Perrineau Jr) are invited to the wedding preparations but fireworks erupt when Harper Stewart's semi-autobiograhical book goes missing and lands in the hands of his friends, especially Lance.

Obviously it helps that the absolutely gorgeous Morris Chestnut played a leading part (yes please ! ). It does not keep you gripped to your seat like a murder mystery. What the film highlighted was that friendships have highs as well as lows (like a marriage really). I particularly like the bonds that the men had in spite of the fact that each of them had completely different personalities. Harper urging Lance to pray in the church was moving. What Harper touched on was how deep their friendship went and the fact that he (Harper) had not forgotten this in spite of the situation he found himself in. It wasn't a deep and meaningful film but that's what made it so enjoyable. It just shows that African American films can be entertaining without being deep and and touching on major issues of the day. It is so completely refreshing to see something uplifting and romantic rather than the usual gangsta/action packed films. When Lance cried whilst saying his vows, I cried too. The bride looked beautiful, the groom............what can I Say?........The bridal party seated at the main table....Harper's speech.... MAGICAL ! The get together at the end was by the far the best, I wanted to jump out of my seat and join in the boogie ! If you've given up on relationships, marriage or a friendship then please watch this film. Let's see more more more black films of this nature - family life, strong relationships, marriage. Let's start being more positive and loving towards each other rather than being continually caught up in these battle of the sexes. Well done ! Look forward to seeing a follow up shortly.

When I went to the movies with my boyfriend we were going through that I love you, but I don't know if I'm ready to get married situation . He reminded me of Hopper (Taye Diggs). This movie came at the perfect time in our relationship. I loved this movie so much that I went out and brought it on VHS. I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.  The movie is about Hopper Collins writing a book about his college years and experience. He writes some well hinded messages that should have been omitted about his best friends and some females involved in his life. This part I didn't get. He tried to cover it up by summing up his details in a &quot;rated PG- type setting&quot; when all his friends knew that it really stood for a &quot;rated R preview&quot; of what actually went down.  So, Hopper flies to NY to be Lance Sullivans (Morris Chestnut) best man in his wedding. But before he actually makes through the weekend festivities, his book is discovered before the release date by his nosey college &quot;girl friend&quot; Jordan (Nia Long). Each character has read or is reading the book throughout the weekend, including Lance. The book centers around all the characters and all of their past scandals. This stirs up a lot of emotions both physically and mentally for all characters. The underlying message is detected throughout their reading the  book, and the wedding comes to a halt. Hopper must face his past in order to move to the present, and Lance has to owe up to what he has done in his past as well.  This is a true love story.

There are no cheap jokes or sight gags. The humor develops from real situations and real characters starting with Harper Stewart (Taye Diggs). Life is good for Harper. His first novel is about to be published. He is in a comfortable two-year relationship and it is the weekend of the wedding of Lance (Morris Chesnut) and Mia (Monica Calhoun), two of his closest college friends. The bad news is his novel is a thinly veiled account of his college years and an advance copy of the book has found it's way into the hands of another college friend, Jordan (Nia Long). Jordan has in turn read the book and passed it along to Harper's inncer circle of college freinds. The really bad news is now the advance copy is in the hands of the groom, Lance. And Lance will not be happy by what he reads.The film is well performed across the board although special mention needs to be made of Taye Diggs in the lead. Diggs perfectly captures the arrogance and the fear of commitment that makes the character of Harper work. Morris Chesnut is also quite good as the groom Lance. Lance is a star running back who is torn by his love for Mia and all the oppurtunies his ""star"" status provides. Mia really has become the rock in this world, his key to becoming a better man and Christian. When Lance finally gets to the chapter that Harper has been so afraid of him reading his entire world is shaken and nothing is on solid ground. Chesnut nails the sense of frustration of a man who all of a sudden finds his house is build on quicksand. Powerful stuff and again, none of it seems forced or pushed. The victory for virtue as defined by this film, however, is not easy and does not rely on conventional finger waging notions and stereotypes. In fact, the most interesting and best acted character is Quentin (Terrence Dashon Howard). He slyly and wisely presents the argument that we are not meant to be monogamous, but he is consistent in not expecting men and women to live by a double standard. He is in many ways correctly cynical about all of his friends and the rest of us. It is a testament to confident story telling when a character presents a contradictory position so well. In addition, Quentin is hilariously madcap with his quips.When we finally get to the wedding and hear the vows of the groom and bride as a celebration of their commitment and union, the movie literally blooms with sweetness and beauty. This may sound corny, but when it is well done as it was here, we have insatiable appetites for seeing people face their selfish expectations and hypocrisy to become true partners in love and life. It is of note that Spike Lee's company produced this movie. Apparently, the able writer-director, Malcolm D. Lee, is a relative. The setting is affluent, literate, intelligent, success driven, neurotically yuppie and entirely African-American. (We don't recall seeing a white face on the screen.) In this, Best Man offers a refreshing and powerful diversion from the heaviness of urban blight and racial oppression as the world of blacks on film. As real as these phenomena are, blacks are diverse in their accomplishments and social strata.",4,The Best part.....the whole movie was done with thought-out class.,1182211200,"06 19, 2007",2007,3234,"['beauty', 'movie', 'truly', 'people', 'inhabiting', 'are', 'cheap', 'jokes', 'sight', 'gags', 'humor', 'real', 'situations', 'real', 'characters', 'starting', 'Harper', 'Stewart', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'Life', 'good', 'Harper', 'first', 'novel', 'be', 'published', 'comfortable', 'two-year', 'relationship', 'weekend', 'wedding', 'Lance', 'Morris', 'Chesnut', 'Mia', 'Monica', 'Calhoun', 'two', 'closest', 'college', 'friends', 'bad', 'news', 'novel', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'account', 'college', 'years', 'advance', 'copy', 'book', 'found', 'way', 'hands', 'college', 'friend', 'Jordan', 'Nia', 'Long', 'Jordan', 'turn', 'read', 'book', 'passed', 'Harper', 'inncer', 'circle', 'college', 'freinds', 'really', 'bad', 'news', 'now', 'advance', 'copy', 'hands', 'groom', 'Lance', 'Lance', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'happy', 'what', 'film', 'well', 'performed', 'board', 'special', 'mention', 'needs', 'be', 'made', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'lead', 'Diggs', 'perfectly', 'arrogance', 'fear', 'commitment', 'character', 'Harper', 'work', 'Morris', 'Chesnut', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'groom', 'Lance', 'Lance', 'star', 'running', 'back', 'who', 'torn', 'love', 'Mia', 'oppurtunies', 'star', 'status', 'Mia', 'really', 'become', 'rock', 'world', 'key', 'becoming', 'better', 'man', 'Christian', 'When', 'Lance', 'finally', 'chapter', 'Harper', 'been', 'so', 'afraid', 'reading', 'entire', 'world', 'shaken', 'nothing', 'solid', 'ground', 'Chesnut', 'sense', 'frustration', 'man', 'who', 'sudden', 'house', 'build', 'quicksand', 'Powerful', 'stuff', 'again', 'none', 'forced', 'pushed', 'victory', 'virtue', 'defined', 'film', 'however', 'not', 'easy', 'not', 'rely', 'conventional', 'finger', 'waging', 'notions', 'stereotypes', 'fact', 'most', 'interesting', 'best', 'acted', 'character', 'Quentin', 'Terrence', 'Dashon', 'Howard', 'slyly', 'wisely', 'argument', 'are', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'monogamous', 'consistent', 'not', 'expecting', 'men', 'women', 'live', 'double', 'standard', 'many', 'ways', 'correctly', 'cynical', 'friends', 'rest', 'testament', 'confident', 'story', 'telling', 'when', 'character', 'contradictory', 'position', 'so', 'well', 'addition', 'Quentin', 'hilariously', 'madcap', 'quips.When', 'finally', 'get', 'wedding', 'hear', 'vows', 'groom', 'bride', 'celebration', 'commitment', 'union', 'movie', 'literally', 'sweetness', 'beauty', 'may', 'sound', 'corny', 'when', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'here', 'have', 'insatiable', 'appetites', 'seeing', 'people', 'face', 'selfish', 'expectations', 'hypocrisy', 'become', 'true', 'partners', 'love', 'life', 'note', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'company', 'produced', 'movie', 'Apparently', 'able', 'writer-director', 'Malcolm', 'D.', 'Lee', 'relative', 'setting', 'affluent', 'literate', 'intelligent', 'success', 'driven', 'neurotically', 'yuppie', 'entirely', 'African-American', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'seeing', 'white', 'face', 'screen', 'Best', 'Man', 'refreshing', 'powerful', 'diversion', 'heaviness', 'urban', 'blight', 'racial', 'oppression', 'world', 'blacks', 'film', 'As', 'real', 'phenomena', 'are', 'blacks', 'are', 'diverse', 'accomplishments', 'social', 'strata']",N/A

I know it&#8217;s usually beautiful people, in beautiful places, doing silly predictable things.Recently I&#8217;ve been seeing trailers for The Best Man Holiday, and it looked rather fun. Well, Holiday (2013) is a sequel to The Best Man (1999). I just made assumptions going into Best Man, a certain level of goofy romantic relationships.Let me make this clear. This is not funny. This is NOT a comedy. This is a drama. OK, so it&#8217;s a drama. But it&#8217;s bad. It&#8217;s re-damn-diculous. Everybody ('cept the bride to be and Julian) was just rotten. Every character was either screwing over their friends, or emitted being a terrible person. There was no fun at all in this flick.  I don&#8217;t know. I just found the film lame, shallow, uninteresting and a waste of time. It's apparent a lot of folks like this film. Maybe my expectations of a romantic comedy totally derailed me, but I have zero interest, regardless, in watching this again.We do also have The Best Man Holiday sitting there, but I told my wife, if this 15 year later sequel is anything like what we just watched, I have no interest in wasting my time. I hope it's way better.My wife tended to agree. I think she was on the fence.

They sure complained enough after &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; was made.The Best Man is about old friends, love and secrets, and it is a romantic comedy -- not a drama. There are plenty of chauvanistic bible thumpers whose actions are in direct conflict with the bible they claim to revere. I thought Morris was hilarous especially when he proclaimed Jordan to be &quot;too damned sassy and independent.&quot; The men are all prototypes. Lance is the jock, Harper is the writer, Murch is the boho and Quinten is the  player. In real life people can't be neatly categorized like that.My only grievance is with the film's ending. I don't think that that Harper should have proposed at the wedding, and I definitely don't think that his girlfriend should have accepted. They just got caught up in the moment. Still, I thought that this movie was fabulous and I will watch it again and again.",4,I loved it!,970272000,"09 30, 2000",2000,1463,"['Casting', 'superfine', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'leading', 'role', 'guaranteed', 'many', 'women', 'would', 'see', 'film', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'nearly', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'observations', 'whole', 'felt', 'was', 'strong', 'movie', 'old', 'friends', 'growing', 'up', 'true', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'trifle', 'underdeveloped', 'movie', 'was', 'primarily', '4', 'male', 'friends', 'seem', 'reminisce', 'bond', 'fight', 'ultimately', 'make', 'peace', 'other', 'women', 'are', 'only', 'presented', 'accessories', 'what', 'wrong', 'men', 'getting', 'flick', 'own', 'sure', 'complained', 'enough', 'quot', 'Waiting', 'Exhale', 'quot', 'was', 'made.The', 'Best', 'Man', 'old', 'friends', 'love', 'secrets', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'not', 'drama', 'are', 'plenty', 'chauvanistic', 'bible', 'thumpers', 'actions', 'are', 'direct', 'conflict', 'bible', 'claim', 'revere', 'thought', 'Morris', 'was', 'hilarous', 'especially', 'when', 'proclaimed', 'Jordan', 'be', 'quot', 'too', 'damned', 'sassy', 'independent.', 'quot', 'men', 'are', 'prototypes', 'Lance', 'jock', 'Harper', 'writer', 'Murch', 'boho', 'Quinten', 'player', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'neatly', 'categorized', 'that.My', 'only', 'grievance', 'film', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Harper', 'should', 'have', 'proposed', 'wedding', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'girlfriend', 'should', 'have', 'accepted', 'just', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'moment', 'Still', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'fabulous', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'again']",N/A
65329,A152C8GYY25HAH,078323418X,Matthew Horner,"[1, 3]","The Best Man is a funny, racy romantic comedy starring some of the best black actors working today. What it lacks in originality, it makes up for in energy. It's a lot of fun.For Harper [Taye Diggs], it's the best of times and the worst of times. His yet unpublished first novel has been picked up by Oprah Winfrey's Book Club, almost insuring that it will be a best seller. He has a great girlfriend whose only fault seems to be that she's pushing the skittish Harper towards the marriage question. His best friend, Lance [Morris Chestnut], is about to get married, and Harper's the best man. What Harper doesn't know is that an advanced copy of his book has been obtained by an old flame, who will be at the wedding. It's making the rounds of his friends. The problem is that the novel's characters are based on his old friends, all of whom are part of the nuptial event. This is going to be one wedding party Harper will never forget.It isn't long after Harper arrives in New York for the big event that he discovers Jordan [Nia Long], the old girlfriend, is the one who obtained the book. And why not? She's now an executive at a big TV station and has the inside track on obtaining information. Harper is panic-stricken. He's written a work of fiction, but a lot of it is based on real life situations which reveal some closely held secrets about his and his friend's love lives. Lance now has the book, but Harper is foiled in every attempt to retrieve it. To make matters worse, the attractive Jordan is trying to rekindle their relationship.Nothing in the plot is new. In fact, it's pretty much a classic romantic comedy plot Hollywood have been remaking successfully for seventy years. Yet when a movie like this is well done, it's nice to settle down and relax with it. It's sort of like seeing an old friend. The cast sparkles. Taye Diggs, who got his training in theater, is one of best actors working today. Nia Long has yet to prove she's quite as talented, but she is certainly one of our most beautiful actresses. There is not a bad performance in the movie.There are a couple of drawbacks. First time director Malcolm D. Lee [Spike's cousin] allows The Best Man to overstay its welcome by about twenty minutes. Two or three scene transitions are rough, indicating that a couple of key moments were never filmed. These faults are enough to prevent the movie's getting a really high rating, but they are not sufficient to smother your enjoyment of this delicious comedy. People who don't get paid to look for these elements might not even notice them.",3,"Fun, energetic, but a bit too long",1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,2566,"['Best', 'Man', 'funny', 'racy', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'starring', 'best', 'black', 'actors', 'working', 'today', 'What', 'originality', 'up', 'energy', 'lot', 'fun.For', 'Harper', '[', 'Taye', 'Diggs', ']', 'best', 'times', 'worst', 'times', 'yet', 'unpublished', 'first', 'novel', 'been', 'picked', 'up', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'Book', 'Club', 'almost', 'insuring', 'will', 'be', 'best', 'seller', 'great', 'girlfriend', 'only', 'fault', 'be', 'pushing', 'skittish', 'Harper', 'marriage', 'question', 'best', 'friend', 'Lance', '[', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', ']', 'get', 'married', 'Harper', 'best', 'man', 'What', 'Harper', ""n't"", 'know', 'advanced', 'copy', 'book', 'been', 'obtained', 'old', 'flame', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'wedding', 'making', 'rounds', 'friends', 'problem', 'novel', 'characters', 'are', 'based', 'old', 'friends', 'whom', 'are', 'part', 'nuptial', 'event', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'wedding', 'party', 'Harper', 'will', 'never', 'forget.It', ""n't"", 'long', 'Harper', 'New', 'York', 'big', 'event', 'Jordan', '[', 'Nia', 'Long', ']', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'who', 'obtained', 'book', 'why', 'not', 'now', 'executive', 'big', 'TV', 'station', 'inside', 'track', 'obtaining', 'information', 'Harper', 'panic-stricken', 'written', 'work', 'fiction', 'lot', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'situations', 'reveal', 'closely', 'held', 'secrets', 'friend', 'love', 'Lance', 'now', 'book', 'Harper', 'foiled', 'attempt', 'retrieve', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'attractive', 'Jordan', 'trying', 'rekindle', 'relationship.Nothing', 'plot', 'new', 'fact', 'pretty', 'much', 'classic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'plot', 'Hollywood', 'have', 'been', 'remaking', 'successfully', 'seventy', 'years', 'Yet', 'when', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'nice', 'settle', 'down', 'relax', 'sort', 'seeing', 'old', 'friend', 'cast', 'sparkles', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'who', 'got', 'training', 'theater', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'working', 'today', 'Nia', 'Long', 'yet', 'prove', 'quite', 'as', 'talented', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'actresses', 'not', 'bad', 'performance', 'are', 'couple', 'drawbacks', 'First', 'time', 'director', 'Malcolm', 'D.', 'Lee', '[', 'Spike', 'cousin', ']', 'Best', 'Man', 'overstay', 'welcome', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'Two', 'three', 'scene', 'transitions', 'are', 'rough', 'indicating', 'couple', 'key', 'moments', 'were', 'never', 'filmed', 'faults', 'are', 'enough', 'prevent', 'movie', 'getting', 'really', 'high', 'rating', 'are', 'not', 'sufficient', 'smother', 'enjoyment', 'delicious', 'comedy', 'People', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'paid', 'look', 'elements', 'might', 'not', 'even', 'notice']",N/A

65347,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,078323418X,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 10]","`The Best Man' is a flawed but generally rewarding romantic drama, featuring a first-rate cast of likeable, talented actors. The film tells the tale of a handsome up-and-coming writer whose first novel has just been  published on the eve of his best friend's wedding. The problem is that much  of the material in the book has been drawn from autobiographical sources -  and now, as old friends gather for the ceremony, the author and best man,  Harper Stewart, has to face the fallout from some of the less than  flattering portrayals contained therein. In addition, the novel contains  the revelations of a few hitherto well-guarded secrets, some of which bear  directly on the principals involved in the wedding itself.Ironically,  the primary strength of the film also emerges as its overarching weakness.  The movie provides so richly textured a depiction of the interrelationships  between and among the wide assortment of characters that it alternately  straddles the line between fascination and tedium. On the positive side,  writer/director Malcolm D. Lee is not afraid to give the characters their  due, to allow them to reveal their many-layered personalities in scenes  that play out in real-time tempo and rhythm. One appreciates the fact that  we are not being rushed along from one highly dramatic moment to another  without time to really get to know the characters as people. The counter  effect of this, however, is that the film often seems too talky,  self-indulgent and dramatically flat, a fact not helped by the excessive  122-minute running time. In addition, the whole novel-publishing aspect of  the story seems both unnecessary and contrived, not to mention lacking in  credibility since it becomes a bit difficult to believe that, if he were so  terrified about his friends discovering his true perceptions of them,  Harper would have written the novel in the first place. Moreover, when we  hear voice-over recitations of a few sections of the novel itself, we are  struck dumb that so badly written and trite a work could be so critically  lauded and commercially successful.However, the film's virtues do,  ultimately, outweigh its imperfections. The actors and actresses turn in  uniformly fine performances and the film deals intelligently and  sensitively with the age-old issues of the fear of commitment and the  two-faced attitude many men have when it comes to female infidelity. Lee,  within the context of his characters, confronts these issues with subtlety  rather than heavyhandedness and the last half hour or so of the film turns  into a very moving celebration of the qualities of acceptance, commitment  and sacrifice necessary to make a relationship truly work. `The Best Man'  may require a little patience at times to get through, but the reward for  those willing to give it a try makes it worth the effort.",3,flawed but rewarding film,964310400,"07 23, 2000",2000,2858,"['Best', 'Man', 'flawed', 'generally', 'rewarding', 'romantic', 'drama', 'featuring', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'likeable', 'talented', 'actors', 'film', 'tale', 'handsome', 'up-and-coming', 'writer', 'first', 'novel', 'just', 'been', 'published', 'eve', 'best', 'friend', 'wedding', 'problem', 'much', 'material', 'book', 'been', 'drawn', 'autobiographical', 'sources', 'now', 'old', 'friends', 'gather', 'ceremony', 'author', 'best', 'man', 'Harper', 'Stewart', 'face', 'fallout', 'less', 'flattering', 'portrayals', 'contained', 'therein', 'addition', 'novel', 'revelations', 'few', 'hitherto', 'well-guarded', 'secrets', 'bear', 'directly', 'principals', 'involved', 'wedding', 'itself.Ironically', 'primary', 'strength', 'film', 'also', 'overarching', 'weakness', 'movie', 'so', 'richly', 'textured', 'depiction', 'interrelationships', 'wide', 'assortment', 'characters', 'alternately', 'line', 'fascination', 'tedium', 'positive', 'side', 'writer/director', 'Malcolm', 'D.', 'Lee', 'not', 'afraid', 'give', 'characters', 'due', 'allow', 'reveal', 'many-layered', 'personalities', 'scenes', 'play', 'out', 'real-time', 'tempo', 'rhythm', 'One', 'fact', 'are', 'not', 'being', 'rushed', 'one', 'highly', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'time', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'people', 'counter', 'effect', 'however', 'film', 'often', 'too', 'talky', 'self-indulgent', 'dramatically', 'flat', 'fact', 'not', 'helped', 'excessive', '122-minute', 'running', 'time', 'addition', 'whole', 'novel-publishing', 'aspect', 'story', 'unnecessary', 'contrived', 'not', 'mention', 'lacking', 'credibility', 'bit', 'difficult', 'believe', 'were', 'so', 'terrified', 'friends', 'discovering', 'true', 'perceptions', 'Harper', 'would', 'have', 'written', 'novel', 'first', 'place', 'Moreover', 'when', 'hear', 'voice-over', 'recitations', 'few', 'sections', 'novel', 'are', 'struck', 'dumb', 'so', 'badly', 'written', 'trite', 'work', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'critically', 'lauded', 'commercially', 'successful.However', 'film', 'virtues', 'do', 'ultimately', 'outweigh', 'imperfections', 'actors', 'actresses', 'turn', 'uniformly', 'fine', 'performances', 'film', 'deals', 'intelligently', 'sensitively', 'age-old', 'issues', 'fear', 'commitment', 'two-faced', 'attitude', 'many', 'men', 'have', 'when', 'female', 'infidelity', 'Lee', 'context', 'characters', 'confronts', 'issues', 'subtlety', 'rather', 'heavyhandedness', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'film', 'very', 'moving', 'celebration', 'qualities', 'acceptance', 'commitment', 'sacrifice', 'necessary', 'make', 'relationship', 'truly', 'work', 'Best', 'Man', 'may', 'require', 'little', 'patience', 'times', 'get', 'reward', 'willing', 'give', 'try', 'effort']",N/A

65351,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,078323418X,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[4, 12]","The Best man is not the best African-American romantic comedy. In fact it's not very good either. A shallow story about a writer who writes a book about an alleged encounter with the groom's bride years before the wedding falls completely apart due to a poorly written script that pushes style over substance. The characters personalities are so one dimensional that I didn't care about them or what happened to them when the groom found out about the encounter. The movie dragged on so long that the upcoming wedding was anti-climatic. It's a shame the writer didn't take time to add some depth to the characters and the story details because this had the potential to be one of the great African-American romance movies.The badly written story follows Harper Stewart (Taye Diggs) Best man of soon to be married Jock Lance Sullivan (Morris Chestnut) who has published his first novel. Unfortunately, Harper's success is so unrealistic it becomes a major plot hole. Harper's book gets on Oprah's book club, and a friend Jordan (Nia Long) a New York TV show producer has the only advance copy. Harper wants to get the book back before his friends see it, because he's based it on real life events. But that's where the plot hole alls hurts the movie. Jordan wouldn't have the ONLY copy of Harper's book because advance copies are widely available to ALL members of the press. All they had to do is call the publisher and ask for a review copy. Publishers give these away for FREE to members of the press on request so they can write reviews of the book and promote it for them.A series of mishaps regarding the book and the wedding build up to the long drawn out bachelor party Where Lance finally reads the book. Reading about the alleged past romance between Harper and his alleged bride, Lance goes off on Harper fighting him on the balcony of the penthouse. and the wedding is off. Harper tries to smooth things over so the wedding can go on in the weak conclusion of the movie dancing and smiling at the reception.I had a bitter taste in my mouth watching The Best Man. Just like in ""The Brothers"", the depictions of ""good black men"" were not so positive. These guys may have money, but their internal character issues made them downright unlikable. Harper wasn't the nice guy the producers depicted him to be. He was an arrogant person who didn't care about anyone. He only wanted the book back to save himself, not protect his friends' feelings. If he truly cared about his friends he would have wrote about something else. Lance was a compete jerk. He didn't deserve to married the way he treated his bride. The Terrence Howard character was a womanizer and the other friend was just a dog in training dumping his girlfriend for a stripper. All the men objectify and degrade the women they are with and around. At the bachelor party the movies misogynistic undertone becomes an overtone and tarnishes the story. I kept asking myself: Where was the respect for the sisters? Why weren't the women shown in a positive light as well. As a black male, I hate to think this is the norm in the black community for men to act like this. These ""positive"" images of black manhood are unacceptable to me. Black Filmmakers have to DO BETTER.As a Published author and struggling writer, I found this movie to be offensive in its lack of knowledge of the publishing industry. This lack of research in the writing of the screenplay hurts the plotline of the Best Man and ruins a good story. Most times first novels get very little support from the publisher and very little promotion by the media. It would be a MIRACLE for a first novelist to have their book wind up on Oprah's book club. The only promotion Harper would probably get would be from Jordan's show.First time director Malcolm D. Lee helms a clunky film that runs twenty minutes too long. His boring visuals look more like New York City vacation slides than movie frames. The pictures he shoots don't tell us an interesting story about the lives of people we want to care about, in a city we want to live in instead, he gives us a random series of pictures in a sequence that barely tell us what's going on. Like a vacation slideshow you wind up bored to death hoping the film would end already.Taye Diggs is terrible as Harper. He's supposed to be a nice guy, but Diggs' arrogant presence makes me hate the character he plays. Morris Chestnut's performance is bad here too. He's a robot just parroting lines without feeling or emotion. When he gets angry you feel nothing from him. The best performance is From Terrence Dashon Howard. TDH is great in almost every movie I've watched him in (Never 2 Big, Big Momma's House, Their Eyes were Watching God) He is truly a gifted actor who rises above weak material and weak direction and makes his characters into real people. He should be a bigger player in Hollywood than he is.  Nia Long, Snaa Lathan and Regina King are awful here because Malcolm Lee gives them no direction and the script gives them nothing to do but be Black Barbie dolls dressed up in designer clothes. I wish African-American filmmakers would stop being so misogynistic and give talented Black actresses' three-dimensional character to play alongside the males because well developed women only help make African-American movies better. A whole generation of black actresses is not actualizing their potential because black male filmmakers won't write well-developed female characters.If you're looking for a good romance movie, Get Love Jones or How U like Me Now cause you can do better than The Best Man.",3,Best man is not the best movie.

65360,A38U2M9OAEJAXJ,078323418X,The Groove,"[4, 16]","What did I like about this movie?  Well, it has a pretty good soundtrack.  We're treated to stellar tunes from Maxwell, Kenny Lattimore, Faith Evans, and a &quot;duet&quot; featuring Lauryn Hill and Bob Marley.  In addition, the fashions are impeccable.  Nia Long wears expertly-tailored jackets made of the finest wool tweed, and Taye Diggs sports the most dapper of threads which perfectly compliment the buppie lifestyle he leads.But what about the script? The performances? And the film's overall premise?  Near-disaster on all counts.  This is possibly the best-looking mediocre movie I've watched in years.  For all that glitters, &quot;The Best Man&quot; is less a movie than a flashy advertisment of buppieism.  It's the widescreen equivilent of an E.Lynn Harris novel, and it's just as superficial.  Nothing wrong with showing bruthas and sistas in a positive, professional light.  It worked for &quot;Love Jones.&quot;  It does not work for &quot;The Best Man.&quot;  Unlike &quot;Love Jones,&quot; this film is too slick for its own good, resorting to chick-flick cliches, one-dimensional characters, and unrealistic settings.  I mean, how many struggling authors (Black ones at that) are able to afford page-out-of-GQ threads and live in these huge, fabulous apartments like Harper Stewart (Diggs)? Also, memo to Nia Long: get some range in your &quot;performances.&quot;  She has a face pretty enough to light up a screen, but good looks do not a compelling performance make.  In virtually every role she's in, she pouts, rolls her eyes, and raises an accusatory finger at some hapless dude.  Not attractive.  And there's the scene in which the fellas let their hair down and engage in guy talk during a card game.  What should have come across as a frank and honest discussion on male/female relations is really a slap of unchecked chauvinism.  The irritating thing about &quot;The Best Man&quot; is that it positions itself as a film far smarter than it really is.  The hip soundtrack, smattering of sharp one-liners, and stylish references are there to trick you into thinking that this movie has something important to say.  It doesn't.  For a genuine, gritty, and uncontrived Black-on-Black love story, check out &quot;Love Jones&quot; and leave this &quot;Best Man&quot; at the altar.",2,The Best Man: a Second Look.,1035763200,"10 28, 2002",2002,2303,"['What', 'did', 'like', 'movie', 'Well', 'pretty', 'good', 'soundtrack', ""'re"", 'treated', 'stellar', 'tunes', 'Maxwell', 'Kenny', 'Lattimore', 'Faith', 'Evans', 'quot', 'quot', 'featuring', 'Lauryn', 'Hill', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'addition', 'fashions', 'are', 'impeccable', 'Nia', 'Long', 'expertly-tailored', 'jackets', 'made', 'finest', 'wool', 'tweed', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'sports', 'most', 'dapper', 'threads', 'perfectly', 'compliment', 'buppie', 'lifestyle', 'what', 'script', 'performances', 'film', 'overall', 'premise', 'Near-disaster', 'counts', 'possibly', 'best-looking', 'mediocre', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'years', 'glitters', 'quot', 'Best', 'Man', 'quot', 'less', 'movie', 'flashy', 'advertisment', 'buppieism', 'widescreen', 'equivilent', 'E.Lynn', 'Harris', 'novel', 'just', 'superficial', 'Nothing', 'wrong', 'showing', 'bruthas', 'sistas', 'positive', 'professional', 'light', 'worked', 'quot', 'Love', 'Jones.', 'quot', 'not', 'work', 'quot', 'Best', 'Man.', 'quot', 'Unlike', 'quot', 'Love', 'Jones', 'quot', 'film', 'too', 'slick', 'own', 'good', 'resorting', 'chick-flick', 'cliches', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'unrealistic', 'settings', 'mean', 'how', 'many', 'struggling', 'authors', 'Black', 'ones', 'are', 'able', 'afford', 'page-out-of-GQ', 'threads', 'live', 'huge', 'fabulous', 'apartments', 'Harper', 'Stewart', 'Diggs', 'Also', 'memo', 'Nia', 'Long', 'get', 'range', 'quot', 'quot', 'face', 'pretty', 'enough', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'good', 'looks', 'do', 'not', 'compelling', 'performance', 'make', 'virtually', 'role', 'eyes', 'accusatory', 'finger', 'hapless', 'dude', 'Not', 'attractive', 'scene', 'fellas', 'let', 'hair', 'down', 'engage', 'guy', 'talk', 'card', 'game', 'What', 'should', 'have', 'come', 'frank', 'honest', 'discussion', 'male/female', 'relations', 'really', 'slap', 'unchecked', 'chauvinism', 'irritating', 'thing', 'quot', 'Best', 'Man', 'quot', 'positions', 'film', 'far', 'smarter', 'really', 'hip', 'soundtrack', 'smattering', 'sharp', 'one-liners', 'stylish', 'references', 'are', 'there', 'trick', 'thinking', 'movie', 'something', 'important', 'say', ""n't"", 'genuine', 'gritty', 'uncontrived', 'Black-on-Black', 'love', 'story', 'check', 'out', 'quot', 'Love', 'Jones', 'quot', 'leave', 'quot', 'Best', 'Man', 'quot', 'altar']",N/A

I found some parts weak, but on a whole, i liked it. But my rationale is this, why write a book about an experience  you would rather kept silent on with the soon to be bride and dedicate the  book to the bride and groom?

It's the type of African American movie that we should see more often.The interaction among the male characters was genuine.  I liked the individuality of the characters.  Harper is the professional writer who's at the top of his game.  Lance is a star athlete who doesn't always want to accept the consequences of his actions; he turns to GOD to get him out of his binds.  Quentin is the consumate player with no set life goals, although he manages to experiment with several career choices; he's blunt and not always likeable.  Murch is the soft spoken member of the group who has a life awkening during the movie.  It seems as if the script was written with these actors in mind.Jordan, is the most developed female character in the movie.  She's a sassy, independent, career woman.  Nia Long gives this character a lot of pizzaz.  You gotta love her.  The character of Mia, is not well developed nor is her portrayal by Monica Calhoun a stand out performance.
