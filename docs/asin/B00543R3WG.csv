I suspect I will have to go read them now as the stories told in these eight movies are spectacular. One of the coolest things was to watch each of the kids grow into adults (and I myself am only a few years older than the three main actors). I'll not review the storylines of each movie here because others have done a better job than I could, for certain. However, the flow of each movie was really well done so that the pacing wasn't too fast. I don't know if this was true for those who had read the books, but as a first time introduction to the series it was very satisfying. The special effects were superb as well, but it was the story that Ms. Rowling weaves on book and then each director does to film. A great two weeks worth of watching.On a side note, there are special features on the discs, but they are &#34;hidden&#34; on some. There is no menu for the first several movies (the show just immediately starts after previews) so to find them you'd have to press the &#34;menu&#34; or &#34;main&#34; button.

One, because I love Harry Potter and this set doesn't do justice to it, and second I am a collector, and an avid blu ray/dvd fan so It upsets me to see what is missing from this set. First, the case is fine, it holds the movies nicely and the blu rays look great, but once you get past the fifth disc you realise that you are just getting a poorly compiled set. For one the later movies are the disc ones of two disc sets, they didn't even try to print a new labels for this set, so each time you see this disc you realise you are only getting half of what is out there. There really are no extas with the last movies, because it's all included on the two disc sets. At least with the first five you get pretty decent extras, but there is so much out there that it seems a waste just to include the movie only version of the last movies.  For casual fans I would recommend it, but if you are like me and love the bonus features, there are better versions out there. I purchased the first movie in the ultimate edition form and am very pleased, the packaging/bonuses are great, and you get so many extras you will be overwhelmed (but in a good way) compared to these editions. I don't like this set because it seemed like they threw it together in order to make a few bucks for the end of the year, they didn't even think about the customers with this one. There were no bonus discs as with other box sets, to put all the extras in one place (to make up for the later movies having so little) But as far as the quality of the movie and how it looks/sounds on blu ray i'd give it 5 stars. and the movies themselves are great (as you know already if you are even reading this) However I think this was just a quick cash grab, but it's cheap enough for the casual fans. and it does free up some room in your collection (doesn't take up that much room compared with the other versions). So like I said for die-hards I'd say look elsewhere, for casual fans, this will probably be enough for you. And this comment has nothing to do with this set per se, but I feel the last two movies (Book 7) should have been combined into one longer movie rather than two seperate ones.  They say it was needed to cover the material, but even with two movies they still overlooked so much material that their point is rendedred moot. If kids are going to wait outside stores until after midnight to buy a book and then read it in one night, then they'd definitely sit through a three hour plus movie. It's all about the money though.

If you enjoy the Harry Potter movies, and don't want tons of special features, this is the set for you.The blu-ray discs do have some basic special features but, do not have the huge amount that the special edition collector sets might have.This set is a great buy.  Every movie for a minimal price.Now, in terms of quality, there are some issues with the set.  It isn't that all of the movies aren't in 1080p, however, the earlier movies were filmed at a time when HD and digital technology was in a newer stage.  So, the earlier movies, while they are scanned or transferred at 1080p, lack the polished, smooth and crisp look that the newer, more modern films have.  It isn't a problem per say, just a reality that a purchaser must be aware of.The audio is great and the newer of the movies are absolutely stunning in HD quality.  The older movies do have some benefit from the transfer but, also some drawbacks as the older CG technologies do not appear to blend or composite quite as well, though only really noticeable to people who look for that kind of thing.The stories are, as they always were, well told interpretations of the book series.  One must always keep in mind that every movie based on a book is just that, an interpretation.  One cannot expect a perfect transition.  Although, in my humble opinion, Dolores Umbridge is just as awful, even with the more limited violence and cruelties compared to the books.If you and your family are fans of the Potter series, this is a great way to get all of them in the best condition and quality possible at a great price.

1441371,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00543R3WG,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[0, 0]","""Harry Potter: The Complete 8 Film Collection""Over the Spring break my family indulged in a Harry Potter film festival, watching all eight movies in the course of a few days. It was great. I was an adult reader of the first book, and made my way through the whole series, even with the tedium at the end. My wife and I saw the first couple of movies together when they came out, but then gave up after that - the first film didn't have the same magic as the book, and the second was just a little too cutesy and coy for my tastes. Maybe we were just too old for this stuff.Anyway, fast forward a decade or so and here we are with a kid whose life is saturated with Potter, Spidey and Star Wars and we figured it was time to just go for it... so break out the popcorn and hand me the remote!It was a great viewing experience, and frankly, more fun than the books, especially the later volumes in the series. At some point the literary enterprise and the Hollywood phenomenon became closely entwined and Ms. Rowling clearly began writing her books almost as if they were production notes for the films. And, as it turns out, that was just fine. ""The Deathly Hallows"" is a terrible book -- uneventful, dreary, repetitive and full of lifeless exposition -- but the screen version, especially taken in the context of the other films, is quite good. Indeed, watching all the movies together in a short time period was a potent experience, making the characters and their losses and growth more resonant and powerful -- the transitions from childhood to maturity, and the purposeful changes in emotional tone from film to film are more easily seen as part of a purposeful and elegant mosaic. Although Rowling (arguably) may have dropped the ball on the books, her overall vision for the saga comes through well in these films and although Harry remains a relatively flat character, the tragedy and complexity of Severus Snape is impressive in such a mega-mainstream entertainment juggernaut. Chris Columbus's formulaic direction of the first two films threw me off the scent many years ago, but I'm glad I came back to it now. It's a worthwhile journey.

Subtitles for ""The Deathly Hollows"" part 1 and part 2 are found as a tab under ""Languages"" as normally found (I hadn't viewed either of these at the time of the original review).  Subtitles for the other six movies can be located in the drop-down menu that contains choices for the aspect ratio and display items.  For me, the blue tag marked ABC was the selection that turned on/off the subtitles.  The quality of the movies that I did play were clearly up to ""Blu-Ray"" quality, with each of the movies, up to the Deathly Hollows pair, the movie disc contained options to view the movie's associated ""special features"" and a number of related interviews that were interesting. Both of the Deathly Hollows movies had a separate ""special features"" disc.

1441416,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00543R3WG,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[3, 28]","Eight films for seven volumes. The whole saga in these films. A real treat.The second beautiful things is that the same actors are used for the main children characters through the eight films, hence over the long period of time it took to produce them. We see the kids becoming teens and twinks under our own eyes and that is also realistically satisfying. They might have been slightly too old at the beginning but they are truly their age at the end.Then the films being a lot more concentrated than the books, some elements come out a lot stronger, to a very critical point. The fact that Harry Potter is an orphan is very strongly emphasized by the films and his uncle foster-father along with his cousin foster-brother are ridiculous, made ridiculous, overdone in the ridiculous line, probably slightly too much in the line of too much. They should be pathetic and appear cruelly sadistic and they only look clownish and farcical.The films also concentrate slightly too much on the fact that Harry Potter is a young teenager and then a young man who is attached to men of all sorts. The story as it is revealed in the end clearly identifies his fate to the decisions of a few men and to the fate of these few men. The only woman that has counted in his life was his own mother who saved him from annihilation with her own love and nothing else. This vision of Harry Potter being a man of many men is very sexist in a way and this world of wizardry is very sexist in all kinds of ways and it is not the Weasley sister and Hermione who save the story from being a man&#8217;s story for men and only men. Girls and women just have to look, watch, admire and applaud but they have no real role to play, or hardly some ancillary roles here and there, like cleaning the teacups. The books were slightly less sexist and we could have expected the films to change that kind of bias.Harry Potter is entirely dependent on Dumbledore who never tells him the truth and that his fate has been decided by three men: Voldemort who wants to kill him to be unique and sole master in the world, Dumbledore and Snape who want to bring Harry Potter to his resurrection in order for him to destroy Voldemort, because Harry Potter can only do that if Voldemort tries to kill him and succeeds, though he will only kill in Harry Potter the part of himself, Voldemort, he had invested in the kid when he tried to kill him the first time when a baby. This Voldemort share in Harry Potter is represented by the scar on his forehead. Snape and Dumbledore knew that but they never told Harry Potter who finally knows when he is able to recuperate the tears of Snape before he dies when killed by Voldemort and these tears reveal this secret  when dropped I n the special secret reader in Dumbledore&#8217;s office.That makes three men, and two will have to die for Harry Potter&#8217;s Voldemort part to be killed by Voldemort and for Harry Potter then to be able to kill the third man of this triad.Three more men are necessary for Harry Potter to survive through it all. These three more men save him in the nick of time three times. In the &#8220;Goblet of Fire&#8221; he is saved by the sacrifice of another student who is killed by Voldemort and it is this death that enables Harry Potter to escape the same fate thanks to the intervention of the sword of his school house. He is saved by Ron Weasly when he is trying to recuperate the sword of his school house in an ice-locked river. He is saved in his last fight against Voldemort when another boy is able to recuperate that sword in the ruins of the school and to cut off the head of Voldemort&#8217;s snake, which makes Voldemort decompose and fall down into a pile of ashes.When you add to these two triple sets the giant Hagrid in the back of all these men you have it nearly all since you should also see the short-lived and evanescent role of Harry Potter&#8217;s godfather Black who will be important all along, or nearly, since his elf will be crucial in the seventh and last episode when Harry Potters is trying to bring together the three Deadly Hallows that will bring Voldemort down.Only two maybe three women are important: Mrs Weasley, Ron&#8217;s mother, in her great motherly quality essentially knitting pullovers for the boys. Then Hermione who is a mixed blood and will be divided between Ron and Harry all along, though she will marry Ron in the end. And Ron&#8217;s sister who will eventually marry Harry in the end. Both marriages produce children, with a third one in the back: the son of the Slitheryn opponent to Harry Potter who nearly ended up as a direct servant of Voldemort, and Harry produces a boy with a triple name, two given names and Potter, the two given names representing the main men who supported Harry in his adventures.On the other hand there are many nasty men of  course to balance the important good men, but there are a lot more nasty women that make the image of women in this film very negative. At the same time they can never be at the top and have the upper hand. No matter how nasty these women may be they can only be second fiddlers to Voldemort of course, second fiddlers he can dispose of at absolutely any time.These films make the ternary pattern even stronger than we could expect as if we were reliving the chase for the Holy Grail and its Christian Trinity. The final fight is between Harry, Voldemort and Voldemort&#8217;s snake, though the snake is fighting against Ron and Hermione and it is when the third student arrives with the sword and kills the snake that Harry Potter can succeed. Such ternary patterns are numerous.Harry&#8217;s mother is married to Harry&#8217;s father but Snape is in love with Harry&#8217;s mother and Harry has the same protection against Dementors as Snape, a doe. Harry is the son of his father and his mother but he carries some part of Voldemort in him and hence has three parents. Voldemort will have to kill his own contribution in Harry to become killable by Harry, provided he has some help from a triad of students behind, but Voldemort can only have the opportunity to do so if Dumbledore and Snape are killed, if possible Dumbledore by Snape and then Snape by Voldemort.Finally in the end Harry Potter has &#8211; with some help from three friends &#8211; killed Voldemort and he has recuperated the famous wand that was in Dumbledore&#8217;s possession and then had been stolen by Voldemort from Dumbledore&#8217;s own grave. Harry Potter, as the third owner, destroys it. It will not have a fourth owner and Harry Potter has three reasons to do it: He cannot possess it (and you possess a wand only if that wand chooses to be possessed by you) because only someone who has killed the person he loves can possess this wand. Dumbledore had killed his own sister? Voldemort had killed so many people he should have loved but he never loved anyone anyway, and thus he can&#8217;t possess it as he says himself to Snape who is the proper owner because he killed Dumbledore who he loved. Harry Potter had not killed one single person he loved. The second reason is that this wand being destroyed is a promise of peace, thus the end of these adventures. The third reason is that Harry Potter refuses power and that is the decision of the author, Ms Rowling who has decided to bury Harry Potter in some kind of ossified and frozen ice conservatory out of which she will never take him.A shameful decision for an author. Of course the films are clearly showing there is a next generation with Harry Potter&#8217;s own son, but that is a promise Ms Rowling does not seem to be willing to follow so far. The films are promising it but the book did not and the author is trying to entertain and distract herself in some social oriented novels and crime stories that are far from being in any way able to compete with the great masters of these genres.The films are a great saga but it is to be regretted the saga has been stopped by its author who is trying to play writer in, fields she does not really control.A last remark on Daniel Radcliffe. He is a great child-actor and we can see him growing but he is developed as a very stiff character, static in expression and action. That is a handicap in this profession. He could have learned how to be active and how to build a real rich and passionate character he would impersonate in its deepest feelings and emotions since he is far from being a child in the last films and his character is old enough not to be a child any more and become a passion ate teenager. He can&#8217;t satisfy himself with being that stiff and cold an actor forever. Methinks he could have been directed better in the last three or four films.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,How could the author abandon them in mid-stream!!,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,8725,"['Eight',

They accuse how WB constantly does this for the Harry Potter franchise, and to be fair, WB has been doing incomplete Potter boxed releases for years, starting with ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" onwards. But when the WB actually makes a nice package with all eight films included, they still complain because there's hardly any bonus material. WB did this for their first four Batman movies before the glorious Batman Anthology came to be, so those fans have been waiting a long time that as well.The set will just have a repressing of the initial releases, and the first three movies include their respective trailers, while ""Deathly Hallows Parts 1 & 2"" have deleted/extended scenes, so the ""no extras"" claim doesn't hold as much water. They have some, as opposed to none. Not to mention the quality of the past three Ultimate Editions' bonus features have declined to the point where I just stopped buying them (bulky packaging, no commentary and no extended editions are the deal-breakers). For me, I just want the movies, and this set allows that. For that alone it gets 4 stars.

sagas.Impressive sometimes doesn`t even begin to describe the high quality of craftsmanship that went into each and every film.From the direction,to the editing to the plot and so on and so on,everything about these films is top notch all the way.The S/FX just got better and better as the series(and technology)progressed.We saw all the main actors grow up before our very eyes without losing touch of their core characters.To round it out,as if it needs saying,is Rowlings extremely imaginative settings and characters.Her entire take on this world of wizardry and her ability to put her ideas to paper,and it to go onto film,and ALL capture and create literally millions of fans from every part of the globe,is astounding or,as Harry himself would say,brilliant.I won`t go into each film,as the plots are quite well known by now,but I will say I found not one clunker in the group.They are all long films,coming in around 120 minutes or much more,but I never found myself looking at my watch or getting bored:a definite sign someone knew what they were doing.Technically speaking the films are in their original w/s a/r of 1:77:1 and are clear and crisp.All DVD`s come in layered round plastic holders.All seem to sit and fit quite snugly.I had to take one star off this impressive series of films for one reason.Warners decided to re-package the original single disc releases.That is if you have already bought them singly or in the 1-5 or 1-6 sets,you will already have what this one puts out,right down to the disc cover artwork,or lack thereof,and the picture/film hesitations that occur most noticeably in the first five that happen in or around the 75 minute mark of each film.Disappointing.They could have at least made a re-run of the series with new disc artwork and gotten rid of those pesky hesitations.But no,Warners,as is like most companies,had dollar signs in their eyes and rushed this set out to cash in on the Potter craze and keep it alive until their next release,which will be.....who knows when or in what fashion.There are very few extras in any of these discs save for the odd commentary or deleted scenes.But it is these extra scenes which makes me think somewhere down the line Warners will re-issue these films not only with several extra discs for each movies,but also in extended versions,similar to the Lord of the Rings trilogy,which would only enhance them.And the extended versions of the LOTR films are magnificent.Me,I am not that rabid a Potter fan that I want to wait for newer versions down the line,so I decided to get my Potter fix now and straight up,with little or no extras.If you are a big Potter fan,and you are among the countless legions of them,you might want to wait for those inevitable newer and remastered versions down the pike...or get these now and get those later!It is your choice but whatever you decide,you know you will be getting eight wondrous and beautiful films that bring Rowlings wondrous

1441552,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B00543R3WG,Robert J. Crawford,"[4, 4]","This box set has come in for serious criticism regarding its limits.  Indeed, there can be no doubt that this set doesn't have extended cuts and director's cuts.  However, what it does have is completely satisfying, i.e. high definition versions of the theatrical releases of the films, wonderfully transferred; deleted scenes from each film; documentaries, interviews, commentaries, and the usual fluff that comes with these things; and some video game materials.  Frankly, I do not think they will release the newer versions (extended cuts and director's cuts) as a box sets until they have released all of them individually - they will do it in a way that maximizes sales, based on timing.  That means that these are the only versions we will have for some time as they will prolong the cycle as long as possible.This will sound repetitive, but these are absolutely great films and have been a part of my family experience for the last 11 years.  We watch them together periodically and always made the trek to the cinema to see new releases.  They spurred my children to read their first long books.  Plus, each film is consistently excellent in its own way, quite an accomplishment for a series of 8 films.While we love the films, I doubt that we will want more than these as we are not the kind of fans that Trekkies are.  Thus, for those like us, I warmly recommend this set.  Interestingly, I got the version in British blu-ray for about $50.

I recently purchased the Lord of the Rings Trilogy box set and let me just say that box set is beautiful! They really put a lot of effort into it. It's a very sturdy box set with beautiful artwork, embossed lettering, etc. Go look for yourself to see what I mean: http://www.amazon.com/Lord-Rings-Fellowship-Extended-Editions/dp/B0026L7H20/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid;=1318790981&sr;=8-4So those are the types of collector editions I look for, so when they come out with a flimsy cardboard box like this one for Harry Potter, it just baffles my mind that they put so little effort into it. However, if you do not care at all about the box and are only in it for the movies themselves, then by all means get this! This is for you if you are only buying it for the movies! But if you're like me and enjoy a beautiful movie collection on your shelf, then it's not worth it if you already own all of the films.So that's just my opinion, but in the end it is really up to you. If a flimsy cardboard box set is perfectly okay to you so long as you have all the films, go for it!

You get all 8 movies on Blu, same as this set, plus three extras discs that this set does *not* have, and it costs you about $30 less even AFTER shipping. You'll have to wait a few extra days to get it in your hands because they have to ship it overseas, but I think most people would probably rather wait than spend than the money.Okay, the UK box isn't quite as spiffy-looking (or maybe it's better, if you're into Daniel Radcliffe). Is a better box worth a $30 price premium? The UK 1-8 box set is undisputably a better version, and it costs significantly less. Warners, why are you trying to sell us this?

Ms Rowling is a competent, sometimes inspired, story teller, but these books are largely devoid of any ""literary"" quality that might appeal to adults. This is understandable; one doesn't expect the quality of Evelyn Waugh or Cormac McCarthy from novels aimed at tweens and young adults. *The first two films, directed by Chris Columbus, are too light in tone (both dramatically and photographically), and (even in Harry's confrontation with Tom Riddle and the basilisk) fail to properly foreshadow the darkness that will descend. The criticism that they're ""too much like the books"" is valid.But starting with ""Prisoner of Azkaban"", the films are better than the books. They show us what Ms Rowling could not (or chose not to) convey in words -- Harry & friends live an a world that doesn't have a guaranteed happily-ever-after ending. Indeed, the generally ""adult"" quality of the last six films is a compliment to the producers' good judgement. (Steve Kloves' economical and focused scripts also deserve praise.)The latter films get /so/ dark -- literally -- that a display with good shadow detail is recommended for maximum enjoyment. I don't know how much grain reduction was used (I saw no grain, at any time), but there's plenty of detail, and no visible edge sharpening.* An ex-boss of mine, an ex-English teacher, recommended them as being pretty good.
