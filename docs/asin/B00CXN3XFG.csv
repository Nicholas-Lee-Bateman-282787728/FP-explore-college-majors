1651995,A2ZJ2H6DRSPVZ8,B00CXN3XFG,Diane Stranz,"[0, 0]","I like movies which shed light on real issues, and I give this movie 4 stars for that reason and because it is very well acted.  I felt slapped in the face the way it ended so abruptly, though:  the real action of the story was just getting started, and I was tempted to give it as low as 2.5 stars because of the lack of climax and failure to finish developing the plot.The thing I liked most about the story is its realistic portrayal of religious hypocrisy and the way it negates the very essence of what religion is supposed to be about.  What I have to say about that is copied from a comment I made on a 2 star review.  The reviewer stated: ""There's a good scene in the church where we get a sense that Travis is not too excited by all the Christian 'devotion'.""  I replied as follows:I disagree because I got the opposite impression.  First, I EXPECTED Travis to not be interested in the church service since church attendance is likely mandated by the rehab program and it was, thus, was not his free choice to attend.  And, yes, at first, he looks like he feels out of place.  But by the end of the service he seems to have warmed up to it, and in the shot outside when he is shaking the preacher's hand he appears genuinely to be thankful for having attended and for meeting people he thinks might be able to help him rebuild his life.  (Don't you think he was being genuine when he answered the videotaped survey questions, and said he was grateful for meeting people who could be role models for him?  I think he was being genuine.)Reviewer then said, ""Later that's confirmed when he has lunch with Bonner and confesses that his mentor's faith has no meaning to him.""  I disagreed: Travis does not say that his mentor's faith 'has no meaning to him'!  Quite the contrary!  He tells Bonner that he believes in God and feels instinctually that his devotion should be an all or nothing proposition, but that since he cannot commit either way he feels uncomfortable being around someone as 'over-the-top' as his mentor.  This is one key aspect of the film's realism (to me): people like the mentor OFTEN turn off genuine seekers like Travis, and it is because the over-the-top 'devotion' they exhibit is usually a fraud: they are either posers or deceived or a combination.I hate religious hypocrisy so I thought one of the best parts of the film was this portrayal of the hyper-Christian couple.  Note that Travis' mentor says he is 'on fire' for helping people like Travis, yet he is so out of touch with human values he cannot extend Travis even the simple courtesy of sharing a cup of coffee with him before church.  Omg did that small moment resonate with me.  I live in the heart of the central Texas Bible belt (where there are literally churches on every corner) and these people will preach to you in a New York minute -- indeed, just the other day a stranger in the grocery store side-tracked my shopping for over 45 minutes! -- but they have almost no ability to engage in simple human courtesy.  They seem not to have gotten the memo that ""if you are not faithful in the small things, God will never entrust you with larger things"": one builds upon the other (Luke 16:10).  Ex: the moving sermon you preach to people you do not know means nothing if you go home and ignore your isolated teen who is spending the evening locked in his/her room.  (For an older movie which is all about this, watch Robert de Niro and Farrah Fawcett in 'The Apostle.')I believe in Christ and have a personal relationship with God . . . but Christianity is so riddled with deception I question it as a legitimate vehicle for God's will (and I think this is one of the messages of this film when you consider that the one person who actually helps Travis is a man who only recently realized that HIS lifetime 'devotion to God' was never the real thing despite his possession of a degree in theology and life-long work in ministry).",4,Ends too abruptly and almost didn't get 4 stars because of that,1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,3929,"['like', 'movies', 'shed', 'light', 'real', 'issues', 'give', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'reason', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'felt', 'slapped', 'face', 'way', 'ended', 'so', 'abruptly', 'real', 'action', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'getting', 'started', 'was', 'tempted', 'give', 'as', 'low', '2.5', 'stars', 'lack', 'climax', 'failure', 'finish', 'developing', 'plot.The', 'thing', 'liked', 'most', 'story', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'religious', 'hypocrisy', 'way', 'very', 'essence', 'what', 'religion', 'supposed', 'be', 'about', 'What', 'have', 'say', 'copied', 'comment', 'made', '2', 'star', 'review', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'good', 'scene', 'church', 'where', 'get', 'sense', 'Travis', 'not', 'too', 'excited', 'Christian', ""'devotion"", 'replied', 'disagree', 'got', 'opposite', 'impression', 'First', 'EXPECTED', 'Travis', 'not', 'be', 'interested', 'church', 'service', 'church', 'attendance', 'likely', 'mandated', 'rehab', 'program', 'was', 'thus', 'was', 'not', 'free', 'choice', 'attend', 'yes', 'first', 'place', 'end', 'service', 'have', 'warmed', 'up', 'shot', 'when', 'shaking', 'preacher', 'hand', 'genuinely', 'be', 'thankful', 'having', 'attended', 'meeting', 'people', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'rebuild', 'life', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'being', 'genuine', 'when', 'answered', 'videotaped', 'survey', 'questions', 'said', 'was', 'grateful', 'meeting', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'role', 'models', 'think', 'was', 'being', 'genuine', 'Reviewer', 'then', 'said', 'Later', 'confirmed', 'when', 'lunch', 'Bonner', 'mentor', 'faith', 'meaning', 'disagreed', 'Travis', 'not', 'say', 'mentor', 'faith', 'meaning', 'contrary', 'Bonner', 'God', 'feels', 'instinctually', 'devotion', 'should', 'be', 'nothing', 'proposition', 'can', 'not', 'commit', 'way', 'uncomfortable', 'being', 'around', 'someone', ""'over-the-top"", 'mentor', 'one', 'key', 'aspect', 'film', 'realism', 'people', 'mentor', 'OFTEN', 'turn', 'off', 'genuine', 'seekers', 'Travis', 'over-the-top', ""'devotion"", 'exhibit', 'usually', 'fraud', 'are', 'posers', 'deceived', 'combination.I', 'hate', 'religious', 'hypocrisy', 'thought', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'was', 'portrayal', 'hyper-Christian', 'couple', 'Note', 'Travis', 'mentor', ""'on"", 'fire', 'helping', 'people', 'Travis', 'yet', 'so', 'touch', 'human', 'values', 'can', 'not', 'extend', 'Travis', 'even', 'simple', 'courtesy', 'sharing', 'cup', 'coffee', 'church', 'did', 'small', 'moment', 'resonate', 'live', 'heart', 'central', 'Texas', 'Bible', 'belt', 'where', 'are', 'literally', 'churches', 'corner', 'people', 'will', 'preach', 'New', 'York', 'minute', 'indeed', 'just', 'other', 'day', 'stranger', 'grocery', 'store', 'side-tracked', 'shopping', '45', 'minutes', 'have', 'almost', 'ability', 'engage', 'simple', 'human', 'courtesy', 'seem', 'not', 'have', 'gotten', 'memo', 'are', 'not', 'faithful', 'small', 'things', 'God', 'will', 'never', 'entrust', 'larger', 'things', 'one', 'other', 'Luke', '16:10', 'Ex', 'moving', 'sermon', 'preach', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'nothing', 'go', 'home', 'ignore', 'isolated', 'teen', 'who', 'spending', 'evening', 'locked', 'his/her', 'room', 'older', 'movie', 'watch', 'Robert', 'de', 'Niro', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', ""'The"", 'Apostle', 'believe', 'Christ', 'have', 'personal', 'relationship', 'God', 'Christianity', 'so', 'riddled', 'deception', 'question', 'legitimate', 'vehicle', 'God', 'will', 'think', 'one', 'messages', 'film', 'when', 'consider', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'actually', 'Travis', 'man', 'who', 'only', 'recently', 'realized', 'HIS', 'lifetime', ""'devotion"", 'God', 'was', 'never', 'real', 'thing', 'possession', 'degree', 'theology', 'life-long', 'work', 'ministry']",This Is Martin Bonner

However it seemed like just as the movie started, it was over. This film is eerily similar to Dustin Hoffman's ""Straight Time"", although in that film there were no positive supporting role models for his character when he got out of prison. With this film I could see the story they were trying to build. However this film lacked any real climatic moments other than the meeting at the diner with Travis and his daughter. In my opinion there were too many scenes spent trying to build each of the characters. When the movie ended I could not tell what path their lives were going to lead. With all that being said I still enjoyed the movie. It was a refreshing change from the drab bore stuff Hollywood has been putting out lately. This was real acting in this movie, and not some comic book character with a lot of special effects.

Once that scene has ended, the fiery Locy disappears from the story forever.Next to appear is an ex-con named Travis (Richmond Arquette, who signs up for the program. He meets and begins to develop a relationship with his program mentor Steve (Robert Longstreet), but that plot thread is also abandoned abruptly, as Travis decides Robert is &#34;too Christian&#34; for him.In terms of the plot, two most alive characters are now dead. And so is the rest of the movie, which tortuously takes the viewer through slow, flat scenes, while the too-loud and uninteresting score tries its best to keep us awake.I gave the movie three stars for the acting by the Martin Bonner character (Paul Eenhoorn), Arquette, Grosse, and Longstreet, who are unfortunately portrayed in the script as smaller than life.

1651998,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00CXN3XFG,Paul Allaer,"[3, 3]","""This Is Martin Bonner"" (2913 release; 83 min.) brings the story of Martin Bonner (played by Paul Eenhorn), an Australian native but long-time US resident who recently has taken a job in Reno, NV, helping inmates at the Northern Nevada Correctional Facility to prepare for life back on the outside. By happenstance, Bonner gets to know Travis Holloway (played by Richmond Arquette), who was just released after a 12 year stint (we only learn much later what for). Both men being new to the area, they come to rely on each other for moral support. As the movie unfolds, we learn more of the personal background of each. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is one of those ""little movies that could"", and delivers a deeply moving story of two men trying to adjust to new circumstances. ""This Is Martin Bonner"" moves at snail's pace, and I mean that as a compliment. Check out the scene in which Travis finally meets up with his now 24 yr. old daughter Diana (played by Sam Buchanan) for the first time since his incarceration 12 years ago. It is for me the pivotal scene in the movie. The performances are ace throughout, although I will see that I was very much taken by Sam Buchanan's performance (she has maybe 15 minutes of screen time, but sure makes the most of it). Finally, kudos as well to writer-director Chad Hartigan, who has delivered nothing short of a gem. But what is with the movie title? This movie is as much about Travis Holloway as it is about Martin Bonner, and so on that account it could've just as easily have been called ""This Is Travis Holloway"".I saw the movie this weekend at the Downtown Independent in Los Angeles, and the screening I saw this at was not well attended, unfortunately. It surely is not a reflection of the movie's worthiness. If you are in the mood for a great indie movie that is miles away from the standard Holywood fare, by all means do check out ""This Is Martin Bonner"", be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray.

1651999,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B00CXN3XFG,"Promise ""promise""","[0, 0]","The story involves an older, gray haired man starting a new job in a correctional institute in Reno.  We see him unpacking his few belongings in a modest apartment and endure a difficult first day at the job.  Then he picks up a fellow on the road who has just been released.  What unfolds is the friendship between the two and the way each of them copes with the challenges of his new life.The actors are first rate.  I was particularly impressed by Richmond Arquette as Travis Holloway, the ex-con.  From the first moment when we see him hunched down to protect himself from the cold, he portrays a very believable person.  As wonderful as all the actors were it is Travis' face that stuck with me long after seeing the show.  He's just so ordinary...he isn't handsome, sexy, charismatic or smart.  And yet there's more to him than that, too.  In a way it's really Travis' movie and I have to wonder why it's titled after Martin.  Sam Buchanan as Diana, Travis' daughter gives a killer performance in her few minutes on the screen.  Her facial expressions in the restaurant, as  she attempts to deal with Travis' clumsy way of getting to know her, are painfully accurate.  I loved her clothes, too....it's all just very well done!  The couple playing the Christian helpers were right-on, too.  I liked the fact that Christians were not portrayed as ignorent biggots  as is fashionable in many Hollywood films.  They weren't glorified either.  Again I found the portrayals very realistic.The character of Martin Bonner is really central to the film and he is well played by Paul  .  He is shown to be an uncommonly decent guy and we root for him throughout the film.  The only thing that bothered me was that he was probably too upbeat and cheerful.  I would have thought that his recent trials would have beat a lot of that sparkle out of him, especially at his age.My other disappointment was that the film was too short.  It ended too abruptly.  But I guess it had told its story and knew when to quite.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I still give it five stars and a strong recommendation to anyone who wants to see a real and good story about real and good people.",5,A quietly perfect story,1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,2174,"['story', 'older', 'gray', 'haired', 'man', 'starting', 'new', 'job', 'correctional', 'institute', 'Reno', 'see', 'unpacking', 'few', 'belongings', 'modest', 'apartment', 'endure', 'difficult', 'first', 'day', 'job', 'Then', 'up', 'fellow', 'road', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'What', 'friendship', 'two', 'way', 'copes', 'challenges', 'new', 'life.The', 'actors', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'Richmond', 'Arquette', 'Travis', 'Holloway', 'ex-con', 'first', 'moment', 'when', 'see', 'hunched', 'down', 'protect', 'cold', 'very', 'believable', 'person', 'As', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'were', 'Travis', 'face', 'stuck', 'long', 'seeing', 'show', 'just', 'so', 'ordinary', ""n't"", 'handsome', 'sexy', 'charismatic', 'smart', 'yet', 'more', 'too', 'way', 'really', 'Travis', 'movie', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'titled', 'Martin', 'Sam', 'Buchanan', 'Diana', 'Travis', 'daughter', 'killer', 'performance', 'few', 'minutes', 'screen', 'facial', 'expressions', 'restaurant', 'deal', 'Travis', 'clumsy', 'way', 'getting', 'know', 'are', 'painfully', 'accurate', 'loved', 'clothes', 'too', 'just', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'couple', 'playing', 'Christian', 'helpers', 'were', 'right-on', 'too', 'liked', 'fact', 'Christians', 'were', 'not', 'portrayed', 'ignorent', 'biggots', 'fashionable', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'were', ""n't"", 'glorified', 'either', 'Again', 'found', 'portrayals', 'very', 'realistic.The', 'character', 'Martin', 'Bonner', 'really', 'central', 'film', 'well', 'played', 'Paul', 'shown', 'be', 'uncommonly', 'decent', 'guy', 'root', 'film', 'only', 'thing', 'bothered', 'was', 'was', 'probably', 'too', 'upbeat', 'cheerful', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'recent', 'trials', 'would', 'have', 'beat', 'lot', 'especially', 'age.My', 'other', 'disappointment', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'ended', 'too', 'abruptly', 'guess', 'had', 'told', 'story', 'knew', 'when', 'quite', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'still', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'real', 'good', 'story', 'real', 'good', 'people']",This Is Martin Bonner
1652000,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00CXN3XFG,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***RATING: 2.5 out of 5.0This is Chris Hartigan's second feature, mainly shot in Reno, Nevada. It's a low key story about Australian native Martin Bonner, a volunteer counselor for a Christian-based group who has a mentoring program to rehabilitate convicts. Ironically, one of the most powerful scenes in the film is right at the beginning, when Bonner and his mentor-supervisor, interview an angry black inmate, to consider him for their program. The impatient, arrogant inmate disparages their attempt to help him and declines to participate.We're then introduced to another inmate, Travis, who decides to join the Christian group--he's been incarcerated for over ten years for a DWI vehicular manslaughter. Bonner meets with Travis first but informs him that he's just the coordinator for the program, and that he's actually assigned to a regular mentor. Bonner gives Travis his card and tells him to call him anytime if he needs help.Travis is set up at a motel and has dinner with his regular mentor and his wife. There's a good scene in the church where we get a sense that Travis is not too excited by all the Christian 'devotion'. Later that's confirmed when he has lunch with Bonner and confesses that his mentor's faith has no meaning to him. Bonner reciprocates by confessing that he too, lost 'faith' in the church a couple of years ago, after working for a Christian organization for quite some time.Bonner is the far better developed character than Travis. Hartigan fleshes out Bonner a bit by depicting his relationship with a daughter and son. The daughter is far away in Maryland, married with child, and Bonner often talks to her on the phone. The son is an artist but never returns his father's phone calls. Finally, the son sends him one of his oil paintings as a present but still never speaks with his father. That's a plot strand that goes nowhere as we never meet the son and no direct conflict between them, is depicted. Similarly, when Bonner goes speed dating and meets a woman, there's no follow up; an opportunity for some additional drama is lost. I did like how Bonner's back story includes mention of his days as a rock musician playing for his band 'Kopyright'. At one point, Bonner puts on an old 8 track tape from his old band, and dances to it while alone at home (the music also plays during the closing credits).On the other hand, we find out little about Travis, including details about the crime he was incarcerated for, his life in prison as well as his earlier days. Instead, the earlier history is supposed to be filled in with the awkward questions he asks his daughter, who has driven three hours by bus, to meet him for lunch.This meeting is the central dramatic moment in the film. Travis brings Bonner to the lunch with his daughter on the pretext that she's requested him all along. Bonner soon discovers that it was Travis who wanted Bonner to tag along and the daughter had no prior knowledge that he was coming. Bonner expresses his disappointment with Travis and leaves him to fend for himself. The conversation then deteriorates with Travis only remembering things about his daughter that occurred years ago, which she can't remember herself.Suddenly Bonner saves the day by returning to the table and acting as ref between the estranged daughter and desperate father. Did Bonner actually get in his car and drive away and then have a change of conscience? Or did he plan it this way, stand outside and give them a few minutes, knowing all along that they needed him to come back and restore some semblance of equilibrium? All Mr. Hartigan wants us to know that ultimately Bonner came back and saved the day.Now Travis owes Bonner a favor in return. The church group videotapes Travis' testimonial which consists of two short questions, putting minimal pressure on the recalcitrant former inmate. And that's it folks! If you're looking for high stakes, you will not find it here. 'This is Martin Bonner' advertises Travis committing some kind of big 'betrayal'; one might expect some kind of violent incident since it involves a character who is an ex-con. But all it comes down to is a lack of confidence on the ex-inmate's part and a white lie to cover up this lack of confidence.The film's ace in the hole is Paul Eenhoorn who is excellent as the sturdy program coordinator. Hartigan must be commended for fashioning this low-key drama that keeps your interest to the end.
