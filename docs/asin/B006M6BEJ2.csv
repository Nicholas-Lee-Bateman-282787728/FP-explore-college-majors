1517268,A1ISW6NMR45Y71,B006M6BEJ2,Tome Raider,"[0, 23]","I started watching 60 Minutes at its inception in 1968 when I was eight years old.  Mike Wallace has been a life-long hero of mine, with Harry Reasoner, Morley Safer, Ed Bradley, Steve Kroft, Lesley Stahl, Diane Sawyer, and more recently, Scott Pelley, Bob Simon, Anderson Cooper, and the beautiful Lara Logan not far behind.  The careers these people have had are amazing. They are journalistic warriors, fighting the good fight. They identify these tremendously significant situations and highlight them for us, showing both sides of the issue and the weaknesses or strengths of both sides.  They better their viewers in ways few in the media world can equal. We walk away from the couch much better educated about the issues after every episode. We are able to vote better, and share our views more effectively and with more confidence.  Even our elected representatives often get the real story from 60 Minutes.  The show has remained substantive and penetrating for its entire run.  Even the celebrity highlights are meaningful and captivating.  60 Minutes is the gold standard in journalistic relevance and merit.Which is why I could never comprehend the Andy Rooney segment.  I don't intend to be mean to the man, but he has now died and I think it's important to be accurate about his legacy. There is no ""Best of Andy Rooney,"" at least from the 60 Minutes phase of his career. It was all bad. The old geezer was vapid and vain.  His repertoire included inventorying the junk in his desk, reviewing letters people wrote and stuff they sent to him, profiles of assorted stacks of garbage around his office, and every manner of pointless banter about nothing.  Here the guy had a piece of the 60 Minutes time slot, and he utterly and entirely wasted it for years--only perhaps one segment a season had anything meaningful or important in it.  I only watched it to see if he would yet again squander those precious minutes.  It was a lot like watching a losing baseball team; one becomes fascinated by watching the spectacle of the team lose game after game, season after season.And the man's fixation on himself was nothing less than weird.  Even his final installment had an admonishment to us to not bother him if we were to see him at a restaurant.  He was really captivated by his own notoriety.  In my mind he was notorious only for being vacuous and wasteful.  That segment could have been used to identify so many important societal trends that a person with his years could have put into some type of historical context.  Instead, he showed us the stuff in his drawers or closets.  I know the demographic of 60 Minutes is older, but I thought that was all the more reason to put someone in that slot who was still capable of making a real contribution to the universe of ideas.  Andy, instead, squandered his time and ours. Having him on the show for so long with his mindless babble was nothing less than geriatric affirmative action.  It was an unfortunate display.If 60 Minutes decides to replace Mr. Rooney, I hope they will put someone in there with a merit which is congruous with the previous portions of the show.  Yeah, a little humor might be fun, but there has to still be real substance.  There wasn't any with Mr. Rooney.  It was a few minutes of intellectually empty calories.  I'm not glad he is dead.  I'm sad about it, as a matter of fact.  But I'm glad he's no longer part of the 60 Minutes line-up.  They can do much, much better.",1,The Weak Link in the Incredible 60 Minutes Legacy,1331942400,"03 17, 2012",2012,3463,"['started', 'watching', '60', 'Minutes', 'inception', '1968', 'when', 'was', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'Mike', 'Wallace', 'been', 'life-long', 'hero', 'mine', 'Harry', 'Reasoner', 'Morley', 'Safer', 'Ed', 'Bradley', 'Steve', 'Kroft', 'Lesley', 'Stahl', 'Diane', 'Sawyer', 'more', 'recently', 'Scott', 'Pelley', 'Bob', 'Simon', 'Anderson', 'Cooper', 'beautiful', 'Lara', 'Logan', 'not', 'far', 'careers', 'people', 'have', 'had', 'are', 'amazing', 'are', 'journalistic', 'warriors', 'fighting', 'good', 'fight', 'identify', 'tremendously', 'significant', 'situations', 'highlight', 'showing', 'sides', 'issue', 'weaknesses', 'strengths', 'sides', 'better', 'viewers', 'ways', 'few', 'media', 'world', 'can', 'equal', 'walk', 'away', 'couch', 'much', 'better', 'educated', 'issues', 'episode', 'are', 'able', 'vote', 'better', 'share', 'views', 'more', 'effectively', 'more', 'confidence', 'Even', 'elected', 'representatives', 'often', 'get', 'real', 'story', '60', 'Minutes', 'show', 'remained', 'substantive', 'penetrating', 'entire', 'run', 'Even', 'celebrity', 'highlights', 'are', 'meaningful', 'captivating', '60', 'Minutes', 'gold', 'standard', 'journalistic', 'relevance', 'merit.Which', 'why', 'could', 'never', 'comprehend', 'Andy', 'Rooney', 'segment', 'do', ""n't"", 'intend', 'be', 'mean', 'man', 'now', 'died', 'think', 'important', 'be', 'accurate', 'legacy', 'Best', 'Andy', 'Rooney', 'least', '60', 'Minutes', 'phase', 'career', 'was', 'bad', 'old', 'geezer', 'was', 'vapid', 'vain', 'repertoire', 'included', 'inventorying', 'junk', 'desk', 'reviewing', 'letters', 'people', 'wrote', 'stuff', 'sent', 'profiles', 'assorted', 'stacks', 'garbage', 'office', 'manner', 'pointless', 'banter', 'nothing', 'Here', 'guy', 'had', 'piece', '60', 'Minutes', 'time', 'slot', 'utterly', 'entirely', 'wasted', 'years', 'only', 'perhaps', 'one', 'segment', 'season', 'had', 'anything', 'meaningful', 'important', 'only', 'watched', 'see', 'would', 'yet', 'again', 'squander', 'precious', 'minutes', 'was', 'lot', 'watching', 'losing', 'baseball', 'team', 'one', 'fascinated', 'watching', 'spectacle', 'team', 'lose', 'game', 'game', 'season', 'season.And', 'man', 'fixation', 'was', 'nothing', 'less', 'weird', 'Even', 'final', 'installment', 'had', 'admonishment', 'not', 'bother', 'were', 'see', 'restaurant', 'was', 'really', 'captivated', 'own', 'notoriety', 'mind', 'was', 'notorious', 'only', 'being', 'vacuous', 'wasteful', 'segment', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'identify', 'so', 'many', 'important', 'societal', 'trends', 'person', 'years', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'type', 'historical', 'context', 'Instead', 'showed', 'stuff', 'drawers', 'closets', 'know', 'demographic', '60', 'Minutes', 'older', 'thought', 'was', 'more', 'reason', 'put', 'someone', 'slot', 'who', 'was', 'still', 'capable', 'making', 'real', 'contribution', 'universe', 'ideas', 'Andy', 'instead', 'squandered', 'time', 'ours', 'Having', 'show', 'so', 'long', 'mindless', 'babble', 'was', 'nothing', 'less', 'geriatric', 'affirmative', 'action', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'display.If', '60', 'Minutes', 'decides', 'replace', 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'hope', 'will', 'put', 'someone', 'merit', 'congruous', 'previous', 'portions', 'show', 'Yeah', 'little', 'humor', 'might', 'be', 'fun', 'there', 'still', 'be', 'real', 'substance', 'was', ""n't"", 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'was', 'few', 'minutes', 'intellectually', 'empty', 'calories', ""'m"", 'not', 'glad', 'dead', ""'m"", 'sad', 'matter', 'fact', ""'m"", 'glad', 'no', 'longer', 'part', '60', 'Minutes', 'line-up', 'can', 'do', 'much', 'much', 'better']",The Best of Andy Rooney Volumes 1 & 2
