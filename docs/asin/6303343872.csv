It is well written, excellent acting, beautiful scenery - filmed on location in Russia - and the music in the background adds to the experience.  I highly recommend this to anyone that loves history.  It is unfortunate that it only aired ONCE on television.  It would be well-worth the networks to bring this type of film back to television - it is a great story for both adults and children (11 and older).",5,"History, Intrique, Romance",1005955200,"11 17, 2001",2001,475,"['wonderful', 'mini-series', 'life', 'Peter', 'Great', 'well', 'written', 'excellent', 'acting', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'filmed', 'location', 'Russia', 'music', 'background', 'experience', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'history', 'unfortunate', 'only', 'aired', 'ONCE', 'television', 'would', 'be', 'well-worth', 'networks', 'bring', 'type', 'film', 'back', 'television', 'great', 'story', 'adults', 'children', '11', 'older']",N/A

The book is a narrative, with no attempt at putting words in the mouths of the historical figures.  When that is attempted, as it is here, in this 1986 mini-series, it can take away from the historical 'sweep' of  events and it becomes a family drama, with many events condensed down to a few sentences.  Putting it on a digital DVD would only serve to accent the fact that this was clearly made for TV.  Lay on top of that, a  rather uninteresting and 'soupy' pseudo-I-don't-know-what  musical score and it bogs down even more. The most authentic scenes are the ones in which actual Russian music is used to enhance the action.  The wisest decision was to film the series in Russia which offers real Russian exteriors, interiors and costuming.  The rather dull direction  doesn't help.  The cast does its best with what it is given (Sir Laurence is obviously reading from cue cards) but the use of all the star names is a waste, clearly done to attract the TV audience.  I would almost rather the soundtrack be in Russian, with sub-titles.  All in all, its an interesting 6 hour movie but it should have been so much more.  Buyer beware ... the ad lists this as a three tape set.  Perhaps some of the sellers do offer that but many are selling the Japanese StarMaker  re-release, which has the entire series on ONE tape with the attendant loss of picture and sound fidelity.",4,"Visually Stunning, Historically Wayward",1383782400,"11 7, 2013",2013,1440,"['have', 'read', 'Massie', 'book', 'mini-series', 'based', 'book', 'narrative', 'attempt', 'putting', 'words', 'mouths', 'historical', 'figures', 'When', 'attempted', 'here', '1986', 'mini-series', 'can', 'take', 'away', 'historical', 'events', 'family', 'drama', 'many', 'events', 'condensed', 'down', 'few', 'sentences', 'Putting', 'digital', 'DVD', 'would', 'only', 'serve', 'accent', 'fact', 'was', 'clearly', 'made', 'TV', 'Lay', 'top', 'rather', 'uninteresting', ""pseudo-I-don't-know-what"", 'musical', 'score', 'bogs', 'down', 'even', 'more', 'most', 'authentic', 'scenes', 'are', 'ones', 'actual', 'Russian', 'music', 'used', 'enhance', 'action', 'wisest', 'decision', 'was', 'film', 'series', 'Russia', 'real', 'Russian', 'exteriors', 'interiors', 'costuming', 'rather', 'dull', 'direction', ""n't"", 'help', 'cast', 'best', 'what', 'given', 'Sir', 'Laurence', 'obviously', 'reading', 'cue', 'cards', 'use', 'star', 'names', 'waste', 'clearly', 'done', 'attract', 'TV', 'audience', 'would', 'almost', 'rather', 'soundtrack', 'be', 'Russian', 'sub-titles', 'interesting', '6', 'hour', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Buyer', 'beware', 'ad', 'three', 'tape', 'set', 'Perhaps', 'sellers', 'do', 'offer', 'many', 'are', 'selling', 'Japanese', 'StarMaker', 're-release', 'entire', 'series', 'ONE', 'tape', 'attendant', 'loss', 'picture', 'sound', 'fidelity']",N/A

370127,A4KDWVIN2L4E0,6303343872,"ThorBjorn ""Norseman""","[19, 19]","I saw this television mini-series when I was young. What an astounding epic! It truly does justice to the life of Czar Peter, and the turbulent saga of Russian history itself! In this glorious narrative, see how Peter the Great, through the very force of his imperious will, dragged Russia into the modern age, and ultimately made his land a world power. witness his struggle with another great man, King Charles XII of Sweden, and the war they fought against each other to decide whose nation would dominate the Baltic region. It was a time when empires prevailed...or perished, in the great game of nations. Czar Peter was a man of great drive, intellect, and passion. In his contrasting character, he was harshly cruel and vengeful to those who opposed him, yet he was also kind and generous to those who earned his respect. He commited his share of atrocities, but his enemies would have done the same unto him if they could. He was a warrior-king, who possessed great paternal love for the soldiers and sailors of his army and navy, a force he built from the ground up. In fact, Peter the Great died of pneumonia, after an incident in which he dove into the freezing Baltic sea one winter, to rescue a foundering boat of his troops. This incident alone was an indicator of the true nature of the man. There were not many monarchs in history who would have done this for their fighting-men.The big question regarding this film is: WHEN WILL WE HAVE A DVD VERSION?",5,EPIC!!!,1159488000,"09 29, 2006",2006,1467,"['saw', 'television', 'mini-series', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'What', 'astounding', 'epic', 'truly', 'justice', 'life', 'Czar', 'Peter', 'turbulent', 'saga', 'Russian', 'history', 'glorious', 'narrative', 'see', 'how', 'Peter', 'Great', 'very', 'force', 'imperious', 'will', 'dragged', 'Russia', 'modern', 'age', 'ultimately', 'made', 'land', 'world', 'power', 'witness', 'struggle', 'great', 'man', 'King', 'Charles', 'XII', 'Sweden', 'war', 'fought', 'other', 'decide', 'nation', 'would', 'dominate', 'Baltic', 'region', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'empires', 'prevailed', 'perished', 'great', 'game', 'nations', 'Czar', 'Peter', 'was', 'man', 'great', 'drive', 'intellect', 'passion', 'contrasting', 'character', 'was', 'harshly', 'cruel', 'vengeful', 'who', 'opposed', 'yet', 'was', 'also', 'kind', 'generous', 'who', 'earned', 'respect', 'commited', 'share', 'atrocities', 'enemies', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'could', 'was', 'warrior-king', 'who', 'possessed', 'great', 'paternal', 'love', 'soldiers', 'sailors', 'army', 'navy', 'force', 'ground', 'up', 'fact', 'Peter', 'Great', 'died', 'pneumonia', 'incident', 'dove', 'freezing', 'Baltic', 'sea', 'one', 'winter', 'rescue', 'foundering', 'boat', 'troops', 'incident', 'alone', 'was', 'indicator', 'true', 'nature', 'man', 'were', 'not', 'many', 'monarchs', 'history', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'fighting-men.The', 'big', 'question', 'regarding', 'film', 'WHEN', 'WILL', 'WE', 'HAVE', 'A', 'DVD', 'VERSION']",N/A

Smith,"[0, 0]","Highly entertaining biographical film of Peter the Great, chock full of never-ending palace intrigues that are easily followed, thanks to fine acting all around.  For all the well-known actors in this cast, I still like the idea that considerable time was spent on Peter as a boy, brilliantly played by Graham McGrath, showing a bright, highly inquisitive lad who liked practical engineering and saw its value to Russia, but whose young life was already in grave danger at all times.  Including his boyhood helps explain some of his ""paranoid"" (they really are all out to get him) behavior in later life.This film should have been on DVD years ago; it's now a few tech generations behind.
