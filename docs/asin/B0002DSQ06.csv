831593,A1YYPGHTQ3JUYE,B0002DSQ06,Cat,"[10, 10]","I have had this for a month now, using it several ways.  I complete the entire workout 1-2 a week, and use the very first section (standing portion without weights, about 10-12 minutes) as an add on to my 25-30 minute cardio vids about 3-4 times per week.  I see HUGE results in by backside and legs...  Yes, it is very repetitious but it is different than alot of the other vids out there that rush through things and stop the reps when you first begin to feel the burn.  I love the instructor, Dolores ~ you can tell she is really working with you.. I find her very motivating and strong.  I consider myself intermediate at the moment, but if you are looking to push yourself to the next level, I highly recommend!!!",5,"If you want a great butt, get this!",1143676800,"03 30, 2006",2006,718,"['have', 'had', 'month', 'now', 'using', 'several', 'ways', 'complete', 'entire', 'workout', '1-2', 'week', 'use', 'very', 'first', 'section', 'standing', 'portion', 'weights', '10-12', 'minutes', 'add', '25-30', 'minute', 'cardio', 'vids', '3-4', 'times', 'week', 'see', 'HUGE', 'results', 'backside', 'legs', 'Yes', 'very', 'repetitious', 'different', 'alot', 'other', 'vids', 'there', 'rush', 'things', 'stop', 'reps', 'when', 'first', 'begin', 'feel', 'burn', 'love', 'instructor', 'can', 'tell', 'really', 'working', 'you..', 'find', 'very', 'motivating', 'strong', 'consider', 'intermediate', 'moment', 'are', 'looking', 'push', 'next', 'level', 'highly', 'recommend']",The Trainer's Edge: Killer Butt With Dolores Munoz
831594,A7I4B28V59EI9,B0002DSQ06,"Chandib ""Serendeepity""","[5, 5]","I own this DVD and agree with some of thoughts shared by other reviewers.  It definitely has a lot of traditional and basic moves with a lot of repetitions.These do work, but I did feel like I needed variety the next day and wouldnt be able to repeat the video 5 days in a week. Twice a week works well for me.  So on other days, I prefer the gym or a different DVD WorkoutMy favorite section in the DVD - Floor work!! It is a lot of repetitions and pulsing..! But works for me, I find sore legs and a tighter [...] the next day.Something worth mentioning also:  stretching and cool down section is pretty decent, Instructor takes the time to hold the stretch and explain the importance of the move.",4,Pretty Good,1164844800,"11 30, 2006",2006,699,"['own', 'DVD', 'agree', 'thoughts', 'shared', 'other', 'reviewers', 'definitely', 'lot', 'traditional', 'basic', 'moves', 'lot', 'repetitions.These', 'do', 'work', 'did', 'feel', 'needed', 'variety', 'next', 'day', 'wouldnt', 'be', 'able', 'repeat', 'video', '5', 'days', 'week', 'Twice', 'week', 'well', 'So', 'other', 'days', 'prefer', 'gym', 'different', 'DVD', 'WorkoutMy', 'favorite', 'section', 'DVD', 'Floor', 'work', 'lot', 'repetitions', 'pulsing..', 'find', 'sore', 'legs', 'tighter', '[', 'next', 'day.Something', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'also', 'stretching', 'cool', 'down', 'section', 'pretty', 'decent', 'Instructor', 'time', 'hold', 'stretch', 'explain', 'importance', 'move']",The Trainer's Edge: Killer Butt With Dolores Munoz
831595,AL63PFK6S156O,B0002DSQ06,"K.H. :) ""Enjoying the Journey""","[28, 28]","This is an excellent tool to work your thighs and butt. Yes Ms. Munoz does stick with the basic exercises, but if you're like me and find it hard to remain focused exercising on your own this tape will be helpful. In the standing segment you do squats, pulsing squats, plies, pulsing plies, forward lunges, stationary pulsing lunges and squats with kicks. However, you do more repetitions then you would do on your own so your legs start to wobble and you can really feel the workout. She gives tips on form and mostly focuses on counting, which is great because I don't like chatty instructors.Then for the second segment which is on the floor you do bridges, with and without a leg lift, heel digs, donkeys and,etc. If you stick with this workout you will see results.Also, if you choose Munoz's assistants show how to add weights and ankle weights to the routine. But these props are not necessary to get an effective workout. It is encouraging that the people on the DVD seem to be working as hard as you are.I highly recommend this DVD. Keep some water nearby and good luck! :)",5,You will feel the burn!,1137196800,"01 14, 2006",2006,1082,"['excellent', 'tool', 'work', 'thighs', 'butt', 'Yes', 'Ms.', 'Munoz', 'stick', 'basic', 'exercises', ""'re"", 'find', 'hard', 'remain', 'focused', 'exercising', 'own', 'tape', 'will', 'be', 'helpful', 'standing', 'segment', 'do', 'squats', 'pulsing', 'squats', 'plies', 'pulsing', 'plies', 'forward', 'stationary', 'pulsing', 'lunges', 'squats', 'kicks', 'However', 'do', 'more', 'repetitions', 'then', 'would', 'do', 'own', 'so', 'legs', 'start', 'wobble', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'workout', 'tips', 'form', 'mostly', 'counting', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'chatty', 'instructors.Then', 'second', 'segment', 'floor', 'do', 'bridges', 'leg', 'lift', 'heel', 'digs', 'donkeys', 'etc', 'stick', 'workout', 'will', 'see', 'results.Also', 'choose', 'Munoz', 'assistants', 'show', 'how', 'add', 'weights', 'ankle', 'weights', 'routine', 'props', 'are', 'not', 'necessary', 'get', 'effective', 'workout', 'encouraging', 'people', 'DVD', 'seem', 'be', 'working', 'as', 'hard', 'are.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'Keep', 'water', 'nearby', 'good', 'luck']",The Trainer's Edge: Killer Butt With Dolores Munoz
831596,A30W8HZ9CKSUSR,B0002DSQ06,"R. Harris ""Whosthatgirl""","[1, 1]",I read the many good reviews and decided to try this out.  I think this is an excellent workout for the lower body.  As previous reviewers have said a most of the sets are long but I think this adds to the good workout.  It also gives you time to work on form and enables you to REALLY work your muscles.  I barely made it through the first time and  am looking forward to doing it again to see if I can push myself even further.,5,Excellent Workout,1164585600,"11 27, 2006",2006,429,"['read', 'many', 'good', 'reviews', 'decided', 'try', 'think', 'excellent', 'workout', 'lower', 'body', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'most', 'sets', 'are', 'long', 'think', 'good', 'workout', 'also', 'time', 'work', 'form', 'REALLY', 'work', 'muscles', 'barely', 'made', 'first', 'time', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'doing', 'again', 'see', 'can', 'push', 'even', 'further']",The Trainer's Edge: Killer Butt With Dolores Munoz

831598,A2J38BGT70VFT5,B0002DSQ06,Viktoria,"[29, 32]","Okay, instead of ""repetitive"" some might actually call this workout ""boring"", which I probably would if it wasn't working my lower half so tough that I was screeching my teeth at various points. No, it's not gonna work your butt only - I mean, over 20 minutes of nothing but squats, plies and lounges are quite tough on your legs as well. And that is ALL you get in the standing work part of the DVD. Unless it's the first time you're making an attempt at firming your butt, you must've done all of them a million times. Doing them with Ms. Munoz, though, will make you do more repetitions than you normally would, making you work those muscles harder than usual.Don't expect any great surprises during those more than 15 minutes of mat work either - do expect an unusual number of repetitions and quite a burn in your butt, though.As another rewiever said, it's rather inspiring to see that Ms. Munoz and the two other ladies in the background are sweating and seem to be suffering just as much as you are. There is also a handful of useful cues, but none of those annoyingly friendly and (supposedly) funny comments you get on a lot of other home workout videos. This one is strictly about some serious lower body work - and, well, not really about fun of any kind.There's also a bonus segment on the DVD, which took me some time to actually find out about. It's an abs/back workout with the good ol' exercises I'm sure we all have done more times than those squats. The weird thing about it is the instructor - this guy with a weird accent, a silvery patch over his right eye and a hairy armpit... He hardly ever says anything and don't expect any real cues whatsoever. I really feel like that bonus part doesn't exactly match the overall quality of the DVD.",4,"Effective, but extremely repetitive",1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,1761,"['Okay', 'instead', 'repetitive', 'might', 'actually', 'call', 'workout', 'boring', 'probably', 'would', 'was', ""n't"", 'working', 'lower', 'half', 'so', 'tough', 'was', 'screeching', 'teeth', 'various', 'points', 'No', 'not', 'gon', 'work', 'butt', 'only', 'mean', '20', 'minutes', 'nothing', 'squats', 'plies', 'lounges', 'are', 'quite', 'tough', 'legs', 'as', 'well', 'ALL', 'get', 'standing', 'work', 'part', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', ""'re"", 'making', 'attempt', 'firming', 'butt', 'must', ""'ve"", 'done', 'million', 'times', 'Doing', 'Ms.', 'Munoz', 'though', 'will', 'make', 'do', 'more', 'repetitions', 'normally', 'would', 'making', 'work', 'muscles', 'harder', 'usual.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'great', 'surprises', 'more', '15', 'minutes', 'mat', 'work', 'do', 'expect', 'unusual', 'number', 'repetitions', 'quite', 'burn', 'butt', 'though.As', 'rewiever', 'said', 'rather', 'inspiring', 'see', 'Ms.', 'Munoz', 'two', 'other', 'ladies', 'background', 'are', 'sweating', 'seem', 'be', 'suffering', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'are', 'also', 'handful', 'useful', 'cues', 'none', 'annoyingly', 'friendly', 'supposedly', 'funny', 'comments', 'get', 'lot', 'other', 'home', 'videos', 'one', 'strictly', 'serious', 'lower', 'body', 'work', 'well', 'not', 'really', 'fun', 'also', 'bonus', 'segment', 'DVD', 'took', 'time', 'actually', 'find', 'out', 'about', 'abs/back', 'workout', 'good', 'ol', 'exercises', ""'m"", 'sure', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'times', 'squats', 'weird', 'thing', 'instructor', 'guy', 'weird', 'accent', 'silvery', 'patch', 'right', 'eye', 'hairy', 'armpit', 'hardly', 'ever', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'real', 'cues', 'whatsoever', 'really', 'feel', 'bonus', 'part', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'match', 'overall', 'quality', 'DVD']",The Trainer's Edge: Killer Butt With Dolores Munoz
