This one has a cute little story but most importantly, lots of great tunes!  He loves to sing along and knows all the moves.  There is lots of time with Captain Feathersword, Wags and Dorothy too.  Fabulous movie that I don't mind watching with him over and over.  He gets some wonderful exercise and has a blast!  We know all the songs and really enjoy them.  If you've been taping the shows and think it's the same, it isn't.  The movie offers so much more.  Really is worth the purchase.  Safari is fun too - with lots of new songs that are really fun.  Plus teaches about animals.  We love the Wiggles in our house.

Initially, I was surprised.  She adores The Wiggles, and we own quite a few of their videos.  Yet, at her age, her attention span is short, and she typically gets up and leaves the room after just a few songs, regardless of which tape she's watching.So, when I sat down to watch this with her the first time and saw that it was a traditional movie, with dialogue and plot, I didn't expect much.  But for some reason, it holds her interest, and she does her best to explain to me what's going on in the simple but pleasant story (regarding a sad-sack magician, Dorothy's disappearance on her birthday, and The Wiggles' efforts to find her in time for her surprise party).After a few viewings, the film began to remind me more than a little of ""Barney's Great Adventure,"" which my son became similarly addicted to five years ago.  The two have a lot in common--similar plots and production, simple set dressings featuring bold colors, slapstick comedy, cheesey special effects, etc.  But I would rather watch this film any day than that one, as I suspect most parents would.The film isn't great, but it's not horrible, either.

It is filmed like a real movie and not like The Wiggles other videos.In the movie The Wiggles are planning a surprise birthday for Dorothy the Dinosaur. Wally the magician hears the singing and sneaks over to see what's going on. He steals Greg's magic wand and Dorothy goes after it. She follows Wally around after the wand gets broken looking to see who can fix it for Greg and trying to find someone who remembers her birthday, which she believes The Wiggles forgot. Wally believes he can not do magic without the wand, but later he realizes he must only believe in himself to win the magic contest. The Wiggles then set out to find Dorothy while the surprise birthday party is being prepared for 6 pm that night. The Wiggles and Dorothy and Wally both have adventures on their journeys. Along the way there is singing and dancing galore! Finally, after Wally wins the magic competition by believing in himself, he and Dorothy arrive at The Wiggles house and to the party.

727851,A3KRZDWHU4AYQA,B00007FCTO,Hoppy Doppelrocket,"[2, 2]","What an epiphany I have had.  The ""Wiggles Magical Adventure"" is one of the greatest musicals I have ever seen.  Originally released in 1997 (the same year my third wife left me over an incident in Baton Rouge), this song and dance show is 70 minutes of unadulterated joy.  These Wiggles have enthusiasm, laughs, melody, and a message.I was extremely uplifted as I watched the plot play itself out and a birthday celebrated.  The songs are splendidly woven into the plot (and I don't want to give too much away, but the plot is basically about a thief getting caught and a surprise birthday for the lovable Dorothy the Dinosaur) and they are very catchy.  I couldn't help singing along as I made the 70-minute drive from my fourth ex-wife's house home with the kids for a long weekend.  The kids enjoyed it almost as much as I did!  And it never gets old--I have watched this truly ""Magical Adventure"" at least nine times and still shout for joy as Dorothy finally realizes the Wiggles remembered her birthday!!!

Worse, the Wiggles themselves have been shoved into a ""preparing the party and looking for Dorothy"" subplot!  Needless to say, my daughter was looking to play puzzles after twenty minutes of this boring feature.Bottom line, the Wiggles are much better when they are the stars of the show.  They are also better in ""sketch-type"" video compliations, where parents can shut them off without interrupting any ""plot"" to play with their children, instead of having the TV babysit them for an hour and a half.
