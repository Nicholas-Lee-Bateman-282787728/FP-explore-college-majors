It's hard to believe the public bought this awful stuff not that long ago. Neither Monroe, nor her cos-star, Dean Martin, could ever get away with acting this lame today.

Several weeks later, they quitely resigned their leading Superstar to a multi-film pact with a dramatic increase in pay from what Monroe had been receiving from a outdated fifties contract, this made her very, very happy, now wanting the world to know about this conquest & other tumultuous events in her life, Marilyn requested of her press secretary scheduling the following Monday a media press conference, this was not to be as her life was taken that weekend and mystery surrounding how this happened remains to this day, hardcore fans feel the cover-up continues with this propaganda filled release, insisting she took her own life throughout ""The Final Days"" becomes very irritating and not for a moment convincing, ultimately this visually appealing documentry is interesting only for having a chance to view the making of what would have been another extraordinary Marilyn film classic...gone too soon to be sure. Looking radiant in every sumptuous frame and totally commanding in every scene, never did Marilyn look more gorgeous & beautiful on The Silver Screen, making ""The Final Days"" a must-have to view Marilyn Monroe in fine & glorious form, clearly ready to take position in the fabulous sixties as leading drop-dead gorgeous Diva of the Silver Screen...RIP beautiful lady, you are loved and missed by so many!",5,Magical Monroe in sublime form~RIP Marilyn...,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",2012,1863,"['Marvelous', 'Marilyn', 'filming', 'Something', 'Got', 'Give', 'was', 'totally', 'awesome', 'event', 'MM', 'fan', 'followed', 'collecting', 'news', 'article', 'catchy', 'cover', 'story', 'Life', 'Look', 'Magazine', 'issues', 'pertaining', 'Miss', 'Monroe', 'amorous', 'adventures', 'what', 'was', 'particularly', 'fascinating', 'time', 'life', 'legendary', 'lady', 'going', 'Presidental', 'Birthday', 'event', 'right', 'middle', 'filming', 'sing', 'Happy', 'Birthday', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'given', 'silly', 'Fox', 'Studio', 'made', 'big', 'deal', 'fired', 'main', 'Diva', 'not', 'smart', 'Several', 'weeks', 'later', 'quitely', 'resigned', 'leading', 'Superstar', 'multi-film', 'pact', 'dramatic', 'increase', 'pay', 'what', 'Monroe', 'had', 'been', 'receiving', 'outdated', 'fifties', 'contract', 'made', 'very', 'very', 'happy', 'now', 'wanting', 'world', 'know', 'conquest', 'other', 'tumultuous', 'events', 'life', 'Marilyn', 'requested', 'press', 'secretary', 'scheduling', 'following', 'Monday', 'media', 'press', 'conference', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'life', 'was', 'taken', 'weekend', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'how', 'happened', 'day', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'feel', 'cover-up', 'propaganda', 'filled', 'release', 'insisting', 'took', 'own', 'life', 'Final', 'Days', 'very', 'irritating', 'not', 'moment', 'convincing', 'ultimately', 'visually', 'appealing', 'documentry', 'interesting', 'only', 'having', 'chance', 'view', 'making', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'extraordinary', 'Marilyn', 'film', 'classic', 'gone', 'too', 'soon', 'be', 'sure', 'Looking', 'radiant', 'sumptuous', 'frame', 'totally', 'commanding', 'scene', 'never', 'did', 'Marilyn', 'look', 'more', 'gorgeous', 'beautiful', 'Silver', 'Screen', 'making', 'Final', 'Days', 'must-have', 'view', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'fine', 'glorious', 'form', 'clearly', 'ready', 'take', 'position', 'fabulous', 'sixties', 'leading', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'Diva', 'Silver', 'Screen', 'RIP', 'beautiful', 'lady', 'are', 'loved', 'missed', 'so', 'many']",Marilyn Monroe - The Final Days

Viewing it in 2012, we can add all the stars and featured players whose names are known: Phil Silvers, Steve Allen and Cyd Charisse, among them. Of all of these shown acting or directing, however, only MM died young (36). Rather to my surprise, she did not survive to see either of the Kennedy brothers killed. 1962. I must say that it is a surprise for me to add up the years and find it to be exactly a half-century since, somewhere in the background of my life at that time, this able successor to Harlow, Faye, Grable, and a few others, ended her screen career. By the standards of Hollywood, when the Major Studios reigned supreme and were on top of the world, she made only a handful of films. In the same time, a Joan Blondell, Bette Davis, Ginger Rogers, would have made at least two or three times that number in their first five years as contract players. Is she still remembered outside of yet another story of she and Bobby, she and Jack, she among Hollywood's overdosed stars? I have no idea. Are her films worth seeing today? To my tastes, absolutely. 7 Year Itch, delightful. Some Like it Hot, classic. Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend? Well, nobody on stage could do what Carol Channing could do. Film actress. though, it seems not. A guess. Monroe did it better for the screen. As to the serious roles. Well, she was learning. Niagara, was, let us say, like Myrna Loy playing those oriental evil sexpots in her first few years.As to the documentary and the segment of the film that might have been made had she lived to perform it, the first is interesting history, the second pure fun. Considering the latter, it give every appearance of being a fine comedy in the style of the period and a hit for MM. Who can tell? The segment is worth seeing on its own merits as well as for a brief reminder of some of the good ones of that era: Dean Martin, Phil Silvers, Steve Allen, Wally Cox and John McGiver (died 1975 at 61). No, I did not forget Cyd Charisse, one of our all-time favorites, here doing a straight acting job.With regard to the documentary, the most striking aspect of it, was the description, by her physician, of her ailment. For me that was like the clouds suddenly parting to show the sun (as a symbol of understanding). It was the same as reading somewhere recently about a talented actor, now about 60 years of age. He has, apparently, been known as a troublesome person, a pain on the set, a user of drugs, but right-on when you got him to perform before the camera. The burst of light: he is what we now call a sufferer from Bi-Polar disorder. Clearly, from the diagnosis of her physician, MM was also a victim of that terrible disease. Yes, childhood experiences, aspiration and anxiety, will play their role, but, fundamentally, in the first instance, the emotional turmoil, the search for anodynes, the need for support, and the like, are due to a chemical imbalance. As in many such bodily dysfunctions, the physical creates the psychological which reinforces the physical dilemmas. Had Monroe had available sufficiently early in life, the medications and medical knowledge available today, she would not have been a happy person, it is still very difficult to treat requiring, like Parkinson's, for example, almost daily adjustment of prescribed drugs, as well as frequent skilled psychiatric support. Yet, as with many bi-polar sufferers today, it is quite possible, given her financial resources and access to the best of every kind of therapy, that she could have had a fuller ""glamour girl"" career, and, perhaps, even have developed to the point where she could find rewarding work thereafter.At any rate, in sum, for even the casual viewer, even for those of us to whom MM was not a fabulous presence but a very entertaining performer, this is a DVD worth seeing.

911384,A1M5405JH9THP9,B0009S2K9W,golgotha.gov,"[9, 10]","Marilyn Monroe: the Final Days (2001)directed by Patty Ivins SpechtThis is a documentary on the production of 'SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE', the unfinished film starring Marilyn Monroe, Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse.  This movie was a remake of the 1940 film 'MY FAVORITE WIFE' which starred Cary Grant and Irene Dunne.  The movie itself has a pretty funny story where a man believes that his first wife has died or disappeared so he gets remarried.  When it turns out wife #1 is still around and comes back into his life, there are lots of awkward social situations.By this time in her career, Marilyn was known for being extremely late to the set and also for demanding a lot of creative control over her characters- two things most directors won't put up with.  This was especially true of George Cukor, the famous RKO director who was slated to direct Marilyn's movie because he owed the studio a favor.  Marilyn's tardiness was a huge problem on 'SOMETHINGS GOT TO GIVE'- the only thing worse than her being late was when she didn't show up at all!  But what was wrong with Marilyn at this time in her life?  Several people are interviewed including her personal physician and some of her closest friends.  The consensus seems to be that she felt nobody took her seriously as a actress.  She was under the wing of dramatic acting coach Paula Strasberg and had attended husband Lee's prestigious ""Actor's Studio"" in efforts to flourish as a real talent.  But she also became ill and was advised by not one but two physicians postpone production on her latest film.  The studio was already way behind schedule and would lose a tremendous amount of money if the doctors' advice was followed.  This escalated tensions between Cukor, Monroe and the film crew.  When Marilyn was on the set, everyone loved the results, including the highly publicized swimming pool scene.  But since the director never knew when Marilyn would show up, he had to ""shoot around"" her- meaning he shot every scene in the movie that she wasn't in.  After these scenes were through, there was nothing left for Cukor to do.  When Marilyn made her famous appearance at President Kennedy's b-day gala, Cukor was understandably angry.  To her credit, Marilyn had told the studio about the gala before production on the movie had started, and if it were an isolated incident it could've been written off as a big misunderstanding.  Unfortunately this was just one of many problems between the director and the starlet.  Eventually Marilyn was fired (and replaced) which was no doubt devastating for her insecurities.  She decided to pull herself together and generate positive publicity for herself.  A sympathetic article featuring her side of the story and  new photographs was published and this probably ""humanized"" her to the fans.  The positive publicity must've worked because the studio negotiated to re-hire her and resume shooting on the movie.  Tragically, Marilyn died of a drug overdose before the production started back up.  'SOMETHINGS GOT TO GIVE' was scrapped and a new version called 'MOVE OVER DARLING' was made in 1963 with Doris Day and James Garner in the lead roles.Marilyn's early death has been discussed many times before.  There is no question that she had a lifelong battle with depression and was using far too many pills.  Her miscarriage and failed high profile marriages were also all over the papers which has to be extremely hard to deal with.  But her life did seem to be back on track around the time of her passing.  Does this mean she didn't kill herself?  It is impossible to know and frankly I'm glad this movie doesn't focus too much on the issue.  You will hear the opinions of people who knew her, including some of the last people to see her.  But you will not hear any of the ""toxic enema"" theories or Kennedy-mafia secrets here- this movie is more memorial than speculation.The last part of this documentary is an attempted reconstruction of 'SOMETHINGS GOT TO GIVE' using the existing footage and notes from the directors, producers, etc.  This cut runs a little under 40 minutes.  The movie is sort of strange to watch, especially after viewing the ""making of"" right before.  Not to mention that Marilyn only showed up for about half the days of shooting.  Watching the movie, you don't always think of the story or the characters being shown- you think of Marilyn and what she (and her peers) were going through.  Its a melacholy moment where you can't really suspend disbelief enough to forget the story of the person who more than anyone has come to embody ""tragic beauty"".Very well made and full of exclusive material.

911385,AU6NNPEF2A2UC,B0009S2K9W,"Leland D. Petty ""Scorpio""","[0, 0]","I have been a huge fan of Marilyn for many, many years now and can say without a doubt, this is one of the best dvds out there recounting the last days of her life. The focus is mainly on the year 1962 and what she did in her last picture, ""Something's Got To Give"", which was never fully completed. This documentary follows Marilyn on the set and has many people that were involved in the making of this movie talking about it. They talk about the ""ups and downs"" of making the picture and working with an Icon personality such as Marilyn. You get to see Marilyn herself working ""feverishly"" (and I used that term literally) on the set trying to appease anyone and everyone around her. She comes to the set late many times and probably causes the film to be behind schedule for many days at a time, all the while being physically sick. Marilyn tried so hard on this picture, but we all know behind the scenes she was dealing with personal problems that did effect her on screen. She even overdosed on pills once while in the making of the film early on and the producer had to tell the ""makers"" of the film ""She is not ready to do this picture"".They wouldn't listen and made her appear anyway when she was physically able to do so. She nearly made up for all lost time and mentality against her with the announcement that she was going to do a ""nude scene"" for the movie. A first for a major motion picture star, ever. (Although here is a side note...Hedy Lamarr in her first motion picture did a complete full frontal nude scene early in her career, it was a black and white picture entitled ""ECSTASY"".After days and days of frolicking in the pool and playing with a defiant dog that wouldn't bark on que, she was eventually fired for not coming to the set and causing undue delays in the production. What Fox didn't know or wouldn't admit was that by firing Marilyn, they had actually cut off their own ""cash flow"" source for some time. They tried desperately to get other actresses in to fill the shoes of Marilyn, even getting Lee Remick to try and come on board. No dice, said Dean Martin, who signed the contract early on in the picture that stipulated, NO MARILYN, NO PICTURE.That was that. The movie was shut down altogether. Marilyn on her own time, sent telegrams to the other cast members asking them if they were willing to come back to the movie if things could be worked out. They seemed to all agree on that. Marilyn did get her attorneys to get her contract reworked at Fox, got Fox to hire her back asap, and signed a new $1,000,000 2 picture deal at the same time. So, things seemed to be looking up for Marilyn afterall. Sadly though, on August 5, 1962, Marilyn was found dead of an apparent overdose of sleeping pills and other drugs at her Brentwood home in Ca. A tragedy had come and soon everyone knew we had lost OUR MARILYN for good.  On this dvd, there is a 37 minute ""mini movie"" of SGTG completely reconstructed in a way as to preserve the integrity of the movie.You also get on the IMAGE Entertainment version the following special features:Marilyn as a Blue Book Model at the Ambassador Hotel - 1943Marilyn as a Blue Book Model at the Ambassador Hotel - 1948Movietone Newsreels""Move Over, Darling"" Theatrical Trailer  (you do not get these on the FOX version dvd put out in 2001)I highly recommend this to anyone that loves Marilyn and is a fan of hers. There also is a 1990 SGTG documentary out there on VHS that is very good as well, but as of this writing, it is not available on dvd or bluray.

911387,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0009S2K9W,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","This fascinating, well done and profoundly sad documentary is an eye-opener into the final months of Marilyn Monroe's troubled personal life and how it impacted her ability to work on ""Something's Got to Give."" The story, narrated by James Coburn, is told at a good pace without being too rushed or too slow; and there's a great deal of compassion for Marilyn from her peers who worked with her on the film including Cyd Charisse and producer Henry Weinstein. True, while Marilyn added to the problems by being remarkably tardy and insisting that Paula Strasberg essentially direct her when George Cukor was the real director, the filmmakers make no bones about it that Fox was incredibly insensitive to Marilyn's personal problems by forging ahead as if there was really nothing wrong with her that some good old fashioned strict discipline wouldn't fix. Sadly, we know in hindsight that poor Marilyn needed so much more TLC than she ever got from Fox or perhaps anyone at that time despite the fact that she had been their biggest star since Shirley Temple! Marilyn had made tons of money for Fox, too.But Fox was panicking over the out of control cost of ""Cleopatra"" and poor Marilyn was trampled as a result. Again, Marilyn had her share of human faults and foibles; she was a troubled woman who shouldn't have been working at that time. Nevertheless, there's one poignant moment with producer Henry Weinstein when he recalls asking Fox if an actor had had a heart attack would they postpone shooting the film and Fox said of course--but an emotional condition was not reason enough to postpone shooting even after Marilyn was found in her bed after what was a dangerous but survivable overdose of drugs.It may seem as if I've given it all away; but I can assure you that I didn't! There's plenty more to this tragic story that what I've written here; and the footage from rehearsals not to mention the restoration of the film that was never finished is incredible. Other interviews give us insight from associate producer Gene Allen; writer Walter Bernstein and producer David Brown.The DVD comes with a few bonus features. We see Marilyn Monroe as a ""Blue Book"" model in 1943 and 1948; and we get ""Movietone Newsreels"" as well as the trailer for ""Move Over Darling"" when Fox actually did complete the film with Doris Day and James Garner. By the way, this was all to be a remake of ""My Favorite Wife"" with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne.Marilyn Monroe: The Final Days is a must have for Marilyn Monroe fans and film buffs.

Here in this DVD is a look into the production, interviews with the cast, writer and director, fantastic stills and costume takes. The narration is insightful and not judgemental. Best of all it includes a pieced together look from what available footage they had at what ""Something's Got To Give"" would have looked like had it ever made it to the screen. A real treat.

I was not even born when she died, but as someone with interests in feminist thought, World War II, Cold War fears and paranoia (by today's standards) and all things Kennedy (not to say I love them--there is much to despise) this is a must have.Certainly this pic skewers the myth of a performer incapable of delivering the goods.  A version of this semi-documentary surfaced on Fox TV in the late 80's or early 90's and I still have it on VCR tape somewhere.  My memory is it was much heavier handed in it's thesis that Marilyn was gigged partially as repayment for prior scores, the excesses of stars at the time (which she herself contributed to in the mid 50's with her walkout on Fox and the amazing contract she negotiated for herself at that time) and a need to portray her as completely unbalanced.  The prior version of this film has extensive commentary by Harvey Weinstein, who in 1962 was a newbie and in charge of trying to hold Marilyn and this teetering production together.  The footage of the prior version of this semi-documentary is faded and has, I believe, different takes of the same scenes for at least some of the footage.  It is interesting to notice the subtle nuances, shadings of differences between takes.  Actually, I find this film hard to watch.  While she gives a solid performance, the subtext of her personal tragedies seems so painfully evident.Had Marilyn finished this film, I suspect it would have been a modest commercial hit or perhaps ""broke even,"" but been the turning point for her career.  And not in a good way.  Her living contemporaries found themselves without an audience as the times changed.  Elvis, Jayne, and the scores of Marilyn knockoffs found themselves drifting, nearly irrelevant and ""a joke.""  In a sense, her death may have been a blessing compared to becoming the joke she always feared herself to be.  Gloria Steinem's collection of essays is strongly recommended as a companion piece to this film, as it explores her life in the context of the (and her) troubled times.  Her poignant blitz to get rehired for this role gives insights into her thinking and her limitless fears of being a living punchline.It is interesting to speculate what would have happened had she lived.  Recently declassified documents indicate that the Brothers Kennedy had quite a problem on their hands, with Marilyn feeling used at their hands.  Further, had JFK returned from Dallas alive, congressional investigation awaited, as his sexual dalliances with an East German spy (and scores of other women) were seriously threatening to blow the lid off his presidency.This ain't for the casual viewer wanting a feel good Marilyn moment.
