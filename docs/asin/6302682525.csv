327776,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6302682525,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","Ruth Chatterton stirred the censors in the 1933 pre-code favourite FEMALE, the story of a woman who conducts her lovelife as matter-of-factly as she does her large industrial empire.Alison Drake (Ruth Chatterton) is quite literally a woman in a man's world.  She inherited her father's booming automobile business after his death, and has run the firm with an iron fist.  Male employees who catch her eye are often invited back to her mansion after-hours, and seduced to the ominous strains of ""Shanghai Lil"", played either on the grammophone or, most bizarrely, by an in-house organist.  When any of her lovers tries to get possessive, they are promptly packed off to the Montreal factory.Beginning to tire of her usual sex games, Alison ventures off one night to see if she can attract a man without her name or money clouding the situation.  At a sideshow fair she meets Jim Thorne (George Brent), and the sparks fly naturally for a change.  But Alison gets the shock of her life when, the following morning, Jim turns out to be a new employee at the car factory!  Desperately in love, Alison reverts back to her old tricks in a bid to hold her man, but she's going to have to swallow her pride - and become the woman she's always kept hidden away...Coming right at the tail-end of the pre-code era, FEMALE suffered under the wrath of the SRC (a precursor to what became the Production Code in 1934); and the film itself was banned from any possible re-release until the Production Code was dissolved in the 1950's.  Married in real life at the time, Ruth Chatterton and George Brent both deliver fabulous performances.  In what's arguably her best screen role, Ruth Chatterton revels in some snappy dialogue (in one scene, where Alison is quizzed on why she doesn't want a husband, Alison snaps back in rapid-fire fashion, ""I'd rather have a canary!"").Available on DVD as part ofTCM Archives - Forbidden Hollywood Collection, Vol. 2 (The Divorcee / A Free Soul / Night Nurse / Three on a Match / Female).",4,"""I know for some women, men are a household necessity; myself, I'd rather have a canary""",1313452800,"08 16, 2011",2011,2008,"['Ruth', 'Chatterton', 'stirred', 'censors', '1933', 'pre-code', 'favourite', 'FEMALE', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'lovelife', 'as', 'matter-of-factly', 'large', 'industrial', 'empire.Alison', 'Drake', 'Ruth', 'Chatterton', 'quite', 'literally', 'woman', 'man', 'world', 'inherited', 'father', 'booming', 'automobile', 'business', 'death', 'run', 'firm', 'iron', 'fist', 'Male', 'employees', 'who', 'catch', 'eye', 'are', 'often', 'invited', 'back', 'mansion', 'after-hours', 'seduced', 'ominous', 'strains', 'Shanghai', 'Lil', 'played', 'grammophone', 'most', 'bizarrely', 'in-house', 'organist', 'When', 'lovers', 'tries', 'get', 'possessive', 'are', 'promptly', 'packed', 'off', 'Montreal', 'factory.Beginning', 'tire', 'usual', 'sex', 'games', 'Alison', 'ventures', 'off', 'one', 'night', 'see', 'can', 'attract', 'man', 'name', 'money', 'clouding', 'situation', 'sideshow', 'fair', 'Jim', 'Thorne', 'George', 'Brent', 'sparks', 'fly', 'naturally', 'change', 'Alison', 'shock', 'life', 'when', 'following', 'morning', 'Jim', 'out', 'be', 'new', 'employee', 'car', 'factory', 'Desperately', 'love', 'Alison', 'back', 'old', 'tricks', 'bid', 'hold', 'man', 'going', 'have', 'swallow', 'pride', 'become', 'woman', 'always', 'kept', 'hidden', 'away', 'Coming', 'right', 'tail-end', 'pre-code', 'era', 'FEMALE', 'suffered', 'wrath', 'SRC', 'precursor', 'what', 'became', 'Production', 'Code', '1934', 'film', 'was', 'banned', 'possible', 're-release', 'Production', 'Code', 'was', 'dissolved', '1950', 'Married', 'real', 'life', 'time', 'Ruth', 'Chatterton', 'George', 'Brent', 'deliver', 'fabulous', 'performances', 'what', 'arguably', 'best', 'screen', 'role', 'Ruth', 'Chatterton', 'revels', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Alison', 'quizzed', 'why', ""n't"", 'want', 'husband', 'Alison', 'back', 'rapid-fire', 'fashion', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'canary', '.Available', 'DVD', 'part', 'ofTCM', 'Forbidden', 'Hollywood', 'Collection', 'Vol', '2', 'Divorcee', 'A', 'Free', 'Soul', '/', 'Night', 'Nurse', '/', 'Three', 'Match', '/', 'Female']",Female VHS

A refreshing role-reversal (an very daring then), with a woman ""on top"". She has all the POWER.But then comes (then-husband in real life) George Brent, who impersonates an independent-minded executive, who changes Chatterton's life...as she were expecting such dominant male?.Nice support by Johnny Mack Brown, Gavin Gordon and Philip Reed (a ""very naive"" young man or something ""else""?

327781,A6S7155T8VTHK,6302682525,J. F. McCausland,"[0, 0]","Alison Drake is the powerful and wealthy owner of a car manufacturing company, and her years of working in a man's industry have hardened her. She indulges in many casual affairs, several of them with her own employees. She meets Jim Thorne, a brilliant engineer recently hired by her company, and attempts to seduce him. Shocked when he scorns her, she modifies her method and eventually he succumbs to her charms, but they have vastly differing ideas of where to take their relationship. The problem with this film is preventing modern sensibilities from coloring how you react to the story; these days, any executive (male or female) who behaved in this manner would be slapped PDQ with a sexual harassment suit, and rightly so. However, this film was made Pre-feminism, when the world was a vastly different place for working women, especially female executives. As this film was also made Pre-code, it is quite frank in its depiction of casual sexual encounters. The shocking aspect at the time was surely the fact that it was a woman behaving in such a casually sexual fashion. An interesting detail is that Ruth Chatterton was herself a bit of a feminist, being an author and an aviator (she was friends with Amelia Earhart), as well as an actress, and she was married to a younger man - George Brent, her costar in this film (considered shocking at the time). Although largely unknown today, she was a wonderful actress and this movie showcases her talents beautifully. Her costar, George Brent - not so much! (I simply cannot understand the appeal of this guy!)

According to Haskell, a superwoman is a woman who lives as a man, even to the point of abandoning her seductive qualities.
