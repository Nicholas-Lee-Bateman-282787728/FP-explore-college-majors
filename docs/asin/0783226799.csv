56454,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783226799,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","`The Jerk' is one of those comedies that is talked about by just about everyone; one of those comedies you feel almost incomplete if you haven't seen since everyone else around you has seen it and is always talking about it.  Well, that's at least how it was with me until like a week ago when I finally got around to watching it.The film tells the story of Navin Johnson, a white man who was raised by blacks.  After finding his rhythm he decides to leave home and spread his wings.  He picks up a slew of odd jobs here and there before joining the circus and meeting the girl of his dreams and then accidentally making millions when he creates an odd invention that proves to be a hit.  After making his money and squandering most of it he finds himself destitute and alone, yet again.Like the tagline suggests; this is a rags to riches, to rags kind of story.The script is actually really well written because it manages to be funny almost all of the time.  There are a few scenes that don't quite work too well, but the films short running time also helps with keeping the pace brisk and so the film really doesn't have time to meander on the weak jokes; they just move right along to the ones that work.  Steve Martin (in his film starring debut) is a comedian whom we all have come to know and love and respect, and this may very well be his finest hour.  He is utterly hysterical, and he actually manages to bring a shade of humane naivety to his characters senseless acts.  We actually really like this guy regardless of how stupid he is.Martin is helped out by a large and impressive cast, everyone from Bernadette Peters to Catlin Adams to M. Emmet Walsh showing up to raise the roof.  Walsh has a hilarious role here as the madman who randomly picks Navin's name from a phonebook and plans to murder him.  The scene alone may be the best scene in the film and is well worth the cost of the DVD.Truth be told, this is not everyone's cup of tea or type of humor.  This is far more slapstick than intelligent, but I think you would know that already.  If you are more into the mature comedies then this may not be for you, but if you can appreciate a good `over-the-top' laugh riot then this is a film you're going to want to see.  You're bound to find a laugh somewhere, whether it's from the name of Navin's dog or from the discovery of Navin's `special purpose'; this movie is designed to tickle that funny bone.",4,"I'm not jerking your chain; this movie is really, really funny...",1225843200,"11 5, 2008",2008,2423,"['Jerk', 'one', 'comedies', 'talked', 'just', 'everyone', 'one', 'comedies', 'feel', 'almost', 'incomplete', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'everyone', 'else', 'seen', 'always', 'talking', 'Well', 'least', 'how', 'was', 'week', 'when', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'it.The', 'film', 'story', 'Navin', 'Johnson', 'white', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'blacks', 'finding', 'rhythm', 'leave', 'home', 'spread', 'wings', 'up', 'slew', 'odd', 'jobs', 'here', 'there', 'joining', 'circus', 'meeting', 'girl', 'dreams', 'then', 'accidentally', 'making', 'millions', 'when', 'odd', 'invention', 'be', 'hit', 'making', 'money', 'squandering', 'most', 'destitute', 'alone', 'yet', 'tagline', 'rags', 'riches', 'rags', 'kind', 'story.The', 'script', 'actually', 'really', 'well', 'written', 'be', 'funny', 'almost', 'time', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'too', 'well', 'films', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'also', 'keeping', 'pace', 'brisk', 'so', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'meander', 'weak', 'jokes', 'just', 'move', 'right', 'along', 'ones', 'work', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'film', 'starring', 'debut', 'comedian', 'whom', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'love', 'respect', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'finest', 'hour', 'utterly', 'hysterical', 'actually', 'bring', 'shade', 'humane', 'naivety', 'characters', 'senseless', 'acts', 'actually', 'really', 'guy', 'regardless', 'how', 'stupid', 'helped', 'out', 'large', 'impressive', 'cast', 'everyone', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'Catlin', 'Adams', 'M.', 'Emmet', 'Walsh', 'showing', 'up', 'raise', 'roof', 'Walsh', 'hilarious', 'role', 'here', 'madman', 'who', 'picks', 'Navin', 'name', 'phonebook', 'plans', 'murder', 'scene', 'alone', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'well', 'cost', 'DVD.Truth', 'be', 'told', 'not', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'type', 'humor', 'far', 'more', 'slapstick', 'intelligent', 'think', 'would', 'know', 'already', 'are', 'more', 'mature', 'then', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'can', 'appreciate', 'good', 'over-the-top', 'laugh', 'riot', 'then', 'film', ""'re"", 'going', 'want', 'see', ""'re"", 'bound', 'find', 'laugh', 'somewhere', 'name', 'Navin', 'dog', 'discovery', 'Navin', 'special', 'purpose', 'movie', 'designed', 'tickle', 'funny', 'bone']",The Jerk

For the most part, all I look for in my DVDs is a quality picture, widescreen and/or the choice of it. I don't necessarily buy for the extras, which didn't come with my early generation wide-screen version of ""The Jerk,"" one of those movies that never gets old. That applies only to the unedited version of course. The successful formula for this movie has been imitated, but never duplicated. Martin was at his comedic peak when this movie came out, and that's obvious throughout The Jerk. And perhaps my favorite female celebrity (yeah, yeah. I get lots of slack for that) of all time, Bernadette Peters plays Martin's love interest, perfectly setting up Martin's unique sense of humor throughout the movie. There are times I merely scroll through the movie just to watch her scenes. Complete infatuation. The whole ensemble in this movie is perfectly cast, as they deliver regardless of amount of camera time. The funniest scenes are gutbusters, many of them embedded in pop culture history. I lost count of how many times we quoted scenes from this movie whenever the opportunity presented itself, often in a drunken delight I'll admit. There's never a moment in this movie where you didn't drink your beverage carefully for fear of spitting it out in sudden subtle, or explicit hilarious moment, and many of those moments have aged well. It's shame Martin has become so reluctant to doing comedic material and given us more paternal roles as years haver rolled by, though it's understandable that he'd stretch himself out. And to be fair, Martin comedies that followed were hit and miss for the most part. They all paled by comparison to the gold standard set by The Jerk. And if that's all you're asking from you're DVD, you'll be more than happy.

Films such as The Waterboy, Dumber And Dumber, and Zoolander have since taken the idea of an outlandish, exaggerated character and turned him into the star of a comic screenplay. In The Jerk, as in the aforementioned films, unfortunate events happen to the outcast reject, and the audience laughs. It's merely an extension of the old Charlie Chaplin or Three Stooges genre of film. But The Jerk is definitely a funny movie...A bona fide idiot, Navin Johnson (Steve Martin) is nevertheless a kind and well-grounded man. Born in Mississippi, Navin is adopted into a black family, but remains clueless in regard to his origins. When Navin turns eighteen, he decides to strike out on his own (which takes the entire day since he decides to hitchhike and hours pass before the first car drives by). Navin initially gets a job at a service station where owner Harry Hartounian (Jackie Mason) takes advantage of Navin's work ethic and a deranged killer makes an attempt on Navin's life...Eventually, Navin moves on to work for a carnival where he meets his future wife Marie (Bernadette Peters). Navin and Marie are in for the ride of a lifetime when a salesman passing through Navin's old service station turns one of Navin's inventions into a blockbuster product. The royalties make Navin a multimillionaire, but money cannot buy everything, and Navin and Marie must work together to be happy...Some of the scenes from The Jerk, such as when Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters are in lying in bed, and Martin says ""It feels like I've know you forever..."" (and then continues with his endless monologue) can stand alone in making The Jerk worth any viewer's time. It's also hilarious when Navin gets ""published"" in the phone book only to have a killer randomly select him for death. By no means the greatest film ever made, The Jerk has its high points, and I recommend watching it once just to see if it's your cup of tea.With a number of memorable scenes, The Jerk is a well-written (from a comic standpoint) screenplay which keeps the laughs constantly rolling down the line. Steve Martin is brilliant in his portrayal of the innocent and nave Navin Johnson. The character's endless optimism and quest to please makes him an instantly likeable character film viewers want to root for.

It doesn't seek to do anything beyond providing laughs by way of slapstick, and most of the time the jokes are funny, but for a film of this nature to completely succeed, ""most of the time"" is not enough.Navin R. Johnson (Martin) grew up as a member of a black family in Mississippi, but after finding out that he was adopted, he decides he needs to get out and see the world. Navin makes his way to St. Louis, where he gets a job at a gas station, working for Harry Hartounian (Jackie Mason). Soon enough, Navin has to run from a madman sniper (M. Emmet Walsh) who has selected him at random as his victim.Navin ends up as a weight-guesser at a carnival, where a tough motorcycle jumper named Patty (Catlin Adams), with a propensity for throwing her helmet at the nearest schlub, teaches him about what his mother told him was his ""special purpose."" Navin, however, falls in love with a young woman named Marie (Bernadette Peters), and together, the two of them become unlikely millionaires due to an invention called the Opti-Grab, which helps to keep one's glasses on his or her face, that Navin helped to create. Navin is about to learn that having money may be as much a curse as it is a blessing.There are a good number of laugh-out-loud moments in The Jerk, most of which play on Navin's dim-witted nature. For instance, when the madman is firing at him haphazardly, Navin assumes he's not fond of cans since he's such a bad shot. Another one that made me chuckle pretty hard was when Marie pulls the trumpet out of nowhere to accompany Navin's ukelele. Then, of course, there is the name of Navin's dog, which is not fit to mention on a family-friendly web page, but gets a laugh every time Navin calls him.Steve Martin's comedy, to me, is hit-or-miss. I am generally not fond of when he is allowed to go too far over the top, as he is for much of this movie. He is much more effective when there are reins to pull him in, such as his understated work in Father of the Bride, but here he is given room to be all over the place, and sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. Did I get plenty of laughs from The Jerk? Sure. Am I going to make a concerted effort to see it again any time soon? No, probably not.",3,"Funny, but Steve Martin's over-the-top style is hit or miss",1115510400,"05 8, 2005",2005,2347,"['Jerk', 'comedy', 'marked', 'big', 'screen', 'debut', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'pretty', 'funny', 'film', 'complete', 'absurdity', ""n't"", 'seek', 'do', 'anything', 'providing', 'laughs', 'way', 'slapstick', 'most', 'time', 'jokes', 'are', 'funny', 'film', 'nature', 'completely', 'succeed', 'most', 'time', 'not', 'enough.Navin', 'R.', 'Johnson', 'Martin', 'grew', 'up', 'member', 'black', 'family', 'Mississippi', 'finding', 'out', 'was', 'adopted', 'get', 'out', 'see', 'world', 'Navin', 'way', 'St.', 'Louis', 'where', 'job', 'gas', 'station', 'working', 'Harry', 'Hartounian', 'Jackie', 'Mason', 'Soon', 'enough', 'Navin', 'run', 'madman', 'sniper', 'M.', 'Emmet', 'Walsh', 'who', 'selected', 'random', 'victim.Navin', 'up', 'weight-guesser', 'carnival', 'where', 'tough', 'motorcycle', 'jumper', 'named', 'Patty', 'Catlin', 'Adams', 'propensity', 'throwing', 'helmet', 'nearest', 'schlub', 'what', 'mother', 'told', 'was', 'special', 'purpose', 'Navin', 'however', 'love', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Marie', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'together', 'two', 'become', 'unlikely', 'millionaires', 'due', 'invention', 'called', 'Opti-Grab', 'keep', 'one', 'glasses', 'face', 'Navin', 'helped', 'create', 'Navin', 'learn', 'having', 'money', 'may', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'curse', 'are', 'good', 'number', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'Jerk', 'most', 'play', 'Navin', 'dim-witted', 'nature', 'instance', 'when', 'madman', 'firing', 'haphazardly', 'Navin', 'not', 'fond', 'cans', 'such', 'bad', 'shot', 'one', 'made', 'chuckle', 'pretty', 'hard', 'was', 'when', 'Marie', 'trumpet', 'nowhere', 'accompany', 'Navin', 'ukelele', 'Then', 'course', 'name', 'Navin', 'dog', 'not', 'fit', 'mention', 'family-friendly', 'web', 'page', 'laugh', 'time', 'Navin', 'him.Steve', 'Martin', 'comedy', 'hit-or-miss', 'am', 'generally', 'not', 'fond', 'when', 'allowed', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'top', 'much', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'when', 'are', 'reins', 'pull', 'such', 'understated', 'work', 'Father', 'Bride', 'here', 'given', 'room', 'be', 'place', ""n't"", 'Did', 'get', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'Jerk', 'Sure', 'Am', 'going', 'make', 'concerted', 'effort', 'see', 'again', 'time', 'soon', 'No', 'probably', 'not']",The Jerk

Well, like other reviewers, I was shocked by the quality of the dvd. It is grainier than tv broadcasts, which I consider the radio of video. It is also worse than the Laserdisc. And its in full screen (of course, this is a good full screen film). Although this film was shot in full screen by Carl Reiner (it was ""matted"" for theatrical showing), I would like to see it in widescreen, because I never have (according to someone I know that has, though, this dvd isn't better than theatrical showing, either). Carl Reiner made a great full screen  film, thinking the only future was vhs, and I can't blame him. The same problems happen with Kubrick films. The video b;ed more than my vhs, and was sharper than my vhs, but hey, it's supposed to be. The sound was mono, and I'd like to be given the choice of mono or 5.1. It, like the picture, is dated, and needs restorartion. The dvd could have held both 1:33:1 and 1:85:1or 2:35:1 aspects, but it just gives you full screen. I really would like a dvd with mono AND 5.1, full-frame AND widescreen, the 2 deleted scenes that were on the tv version (and I know there has to be more than just 2), a documentary on the  making, a retrospective documentary  with the living members, such as Steve Martin (Navin), Bernadette Peters (Marie), Catlin Adams (Patty), and Rob Reiner (as himself). There should also be commentary with those mentioned above. There should also be trailers, and production notes, as were on this disc. And those are just some ones that come to mind.

Also there are no special features of any kind which makes it probably wise to wait for a properly restored and remastered version with at least 5.1 surround options to surface in either the standard or Blu-ray formats.

There are so many memorable sound bytes in this movie that it could rival Caddyshack for the honor of greatest quote fest.  Uncommon hilarity and situational goofiness mark this film Steve's comic classic.  This movie has been a family favorite since it debuted on TV in the early eighties, when we were too young to see the uncensored version.  So we got to deal with Navin's dog being named 'Stupid' instead of ..., close examination of the poor dubbing clued us in though.  The TV version also includes parts that the uncensored is missing, ala Navin's bid to be president of Texaco oil and his generous contribution to Donny's airplane seats fund.  It's an old story, one you've probably heard before, witness Navin's inability to find the rhythm as a white man being raised by poor black sharecroppers as their own. Singing the blues with the family doesn't help, because the songs depress him. Not even the sandwich wrapped in cellophane can stem the feeling that he's somehow 'different'. Mother sits him down and in a tender moment tells him he would be loved if he were the color of a baboons 'head'. Upon finding the beat, Navin strikes out on his own to see the world, proceeding past the end of the fence.  My favorite chapter of the film comes next when Navin takes his first job at Jackie Mason's gas station.  This situation leads to some of the juiciest dialogue as Navin haggles for a $1.10 an hour wage, wrangles a rental living space, loses a church to a car-load of credit card toting Latinos including Mr. Neusbaum, and is targeted for termination by a psychotic hit man. Beyond that, Navin finds love and lust, fame and fortune in turn while never forgetting his parents and past `that's a good boy'. Navin's child-like navet&eacute; coupled with his stupidity makes him an extremely endearing character, ultimately capable of winning the hand of Marie [Bernadette Peters], his true love... it also helps that he has a special purpose, 11 million dollars, and daisy stems on his roses.

What can most likely be cited as the spawning point for this new renaissance of comedy is probably a show called NBC's Saturday Night. The first few seasons of Saturday Night Live brought the likes of Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, John Belushi, Steve Martin (although he was not apart of the cast he hosted in the first season and currently holds the SNL hosting record) and more of the still most iconic and funniest people in the new era of comedy and show business. The Jerk is a hilarious comedy classic with Steve Martin playing one of his famous characters. The story is funny and probably offensive to some, which is partly why it is so funny.A comedy debuting with an R rating was a risky thing in the 1970's but it was such a hit that movies like Animal House and The Blues Brothers followed right in its path, creating a cult of films like these that are ultimately cemented in the Comedy Movie Hall of Fame. Martin inspired many comedians with this film and many comedy filmmakers were influenced by this film. Although Martin is still active in the film industry and continues to do comedies, as most artists, his best work can be found in his early compositions alongside some of the industries funniest people.

This is probably the best Steve Martin movie if you want to see Steve in his natural element.

Especially the delicious Bernadette Peters who steals every scene she's in. Then there's Caitlin Adams in a fantastic bit role as the hard biker chick. And to top it off Jackie Mason is an added treat as the gas station owner who gives Naman little else but a very heavy NY accent. And did I mention Mabel King? Just great as Naman's foster mother. The scene where she is consoling Naman for not being like ""the rest of us"" is just a joy to watch. She is a very gifted actress. And where does Carl Reiner leave off and Steve Martin take over? I guess we'll never know. One thing is for sure.....Carl definitely left his finger prints all over this masterful comedy. I'll go as far to say it's 60% to 40% that Carl is responsible for this collaberation.

Steve Martin's collaboration with director-writer Carl Reiner would bring many other memorable comedy films to the big screen for audiences to watch and laugh.Steve Martin is Navin Johnson, an innocent dullard son of poor Black sharecroppers in the South who just can't seem to have any beat or rythm in his blood.  Navin has high hopes though, and so goes out to see the big world by hitching a ride to take him several blocks away.  After realizing how big the world really is, Navin finally comes to the big city to make a life for himself.  He's soon thrilled to see that he's someone important when his name appears in the phone book.  Navin eventually explores love with a woman played by Bernadette Peters. He also learns the values of entrepreneurship after he innocently invents a contraption for glasses called the Optigrab.  Fortune finally arrives but poor Navin is just too slow to deal with the greed, dishonesty, and other life misfortunes that pervade the world.  After many trials and tribulations, he realizes that his family and friends are all that matters.A very touching comedy about fool's luck and childish innocence in an otherwise depraved world.

A later edition was released which does respect the movie and offer it in widescreen format.  If you are purchasing, be sure to get the anniversary version of the movie so you'll see the ENTIRE movie and not lose the images on the edges of the screen.  Remainder of original review left as is.  Thanks!---First off, I love this movie.  It's silly, it's funny, it's touching in some places, but mostly, it's just entertaining.My biggest complaint with this DVD is that it's one that offers little to no bonus value, and, to me, commits the cardinal sin of not putting the movie in it's original format - instead offering only a Pan and Scan Full Screen presentation.I've hoped for several years that this movie would get a 'special anniversary' or other 'collectors edition' that would offer the original wide screen format and some decent special features, but finally had to break down and purchase this 'original' release of the DVD because my wishes seem to be going unanswered.Please note that I rate the movie itself here a full 5 stars (* * * * *), but the DVD gets only 2 stars, for it's lack of respect to the buying public.The movie was a classic when it was released.Steve Martin, the ultimate 'white guy' finds himself 'born a poor black child', without rhythm and unable to figure out why he doesn't fit in with his Black brothers and sisters.He gets motivated to go off and discover himself, and his adventures along the way are a total riot.In many ways a model that could have been used for the original ""Rain Man"" character,  Navin R. Johnson (Martin's character) had a simple charm and naive streak that was almost unbelievable, but too funny not to laugh at.This movie is a comedy classic, and it deserves a Special Edition and better treatment on DVD.

Not even the scenes that were included in the network TV version are to be found as ""deleted scenes"" (I'd personally rather not have them at all then to have the re-inserted into the movie, as some have complained about).  Let's just face it, the ""extras"" here are worthless pieces of junk.  The ukelele play-along wouldn't be so annoying if it were surrounded by some solid supplements (it would remain utterly pointless).Probably even more worthless than the play-along thing, is the so-called ""Lost Filmstrips of Carlos Las Vegas De Cordova.""  Some web critics have been duped into thinking that this is actually footage from the original production.  It's not.  This is some clown's version of fan fiction.  This ""lost"" footage was quite obviously newly created specifically to be a supplement for this dvd, shot on video and treated to look sort of like old black and white film.  The guy who's supposed to be Steve Martin shouldn't fool anyone.  This thing is beyond words, it's so ridiculous.Much has been made of this being the first time ""The Jerk"" has been presented in widescreen since it's theatrical run.  I'm all in favor of preserving the original aspect ratio, and I was initially very glad to know this would be finally getting that treatment.  The truth is, not much if anything is really ehanced to the viewing experience of this movie by it being in 1.85:1.  In fact, I was so used to the full-frame presentation on the previous disc, that I was distracted by the loss of at least one gag - a victim of the widescreen framing.  Well, maybe loss is going too far - but let's say the obstructed-view of at least one gag.  I'm referring specifically to the scene where Jackie Mason, at the gas station right before his wife gets out of the car, uses a series of hand signals to communicate to Navin (the subject is Mason's love life).  Those who have seen the movie know what I'm talking about, as Navin cluelessly mimics the series of hand motions.  It's always been a hilarious moment, though the widescreen presentation does actually work against this particular scene as Mason's hand signals go mostly unseen.  It's hard to believe the scene was presented this way in theaters.  Anyway, that may seem like nit-picking, but it was nonetheless dissapointing for me - a fan of every last detail in this movie.",3,"Five-star movie, far less for this Anniversary Edition",1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,2652,"['Figured', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'throw', 'two', 'cents', 'even', 'other', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'shortcomings', 'latest', 'release', 'true', 'comedy', 'classic', 'Jerk', 'guess', 'Universal', 'called', 'Anniversary', 'edition', 'rather', 'Special', 'edition', 'technically', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'Not', 'even', 'scenes', 'were', 'included', 'network', 'TV', 'version', 'are', 'be', 'found', 'deleted', 'scenes', ""'d"", 'personally', 'rather', 'not', 'have', 'then', 'have', 're-inserted', 'movie', 'have', 'complained', 'Let', 'just', 'face', 'extras', 'here', 'are', 'worthless', 'pieces', 'junk', 'ukelele', 'play-along', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'annoying', 'were', 'surrounded', 'solid', 'supplements', 'would', 'remain', 'utterly', 'pointless', '.Probably', 'even', 'more', 'worthless', 'play-along', 'thing', 'so-called', 'Lost', 'Filmstrips', 'Carlos', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'De', 'Cordova', 'web', 'critics', 'have', 'been', 'duped', 'thinking', 'actually', 'footage', 'original', 'production', 'not', 'clown', 'version', 'fan', 'fiction', 'lost', 'footage', 'was', 'quite', 'obviously', 'newly', 'created', 'specifically', 'be', 'supplement', 'dvd', 'shot', 'video', 'treated', 'look', 'sort', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'guy', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'should', ""n't"", 'fool', 'anyone', 'thing', 'words', 'so', 'ridiculous.Much', 'been', 'made', 'being', 'first', 'time', 'Jerk', 'been', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'theatrical', 'run', ""'m"", 'favor', 'preserving', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'was', 'initially', 'very', 'glad', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'finally', 'getting', 'treatment', 'truth', 'not', 'much', 'anything', 'really', 'ehanced', 'viewing', 'experience', 'movie', 'being', '1.85:1', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'used', 'full-frame', 'presentation', 'previous', 'disc', 'was', 'distracted', 'loss', 'least', 'one', 'gag', 'victim', 'widescreen', 'framing', 'Well', 'maybe', 'loss', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'let', 'say', 'obstructed-view', 'least', 'one', 'gag', ""'m"", 'referring', 'specifically', 'scene', 'where', 'Jackie', 'Mason', 'gas', 'station', 'right', 'wife', 'car', 'series', 'hand', 'signals', 'communicate', 'Navin', 'subject', 'Mason', 'love', 'life', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'about', 'Navin', 'cluelessly', 'series', 'hand', 'motions', 'always', 'been', 'hilarious', 'moment', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'actually', 'work', 'particular', 'scene', 'Mason', 'hand', 'signals', 'go', 'mostly', 'unseen', 'hard', 'believe', 'scene', 'was', 'presented', 'way', 'theaters', 'Anyway', 'may', 'seem', 'nit-picking', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'dissapointing', 'fan', 'last', 'detail', 'movie']",The Jerk

Navin loves his family but he feels he doesn't fit in. His family all has rhythm, but he doesn't. So, on his 18th birthday he leaves to discover the rest of the world. After hitching a few rides he ends up in St. Louis working and living at a gas station. My favorite scene in the entire movie happens there. The new phone books arrive and Navin gets all excited. &#34;This is the kind of spontaneous publicity--your name in print--that makes people. I'm in print! Things are going to start happening to me now.&#34; That scene is priceless. While at the gas station Navin invents a device for a man's glasses that later makes Navin a billionaire. But, before that happens he gets shot at by a crazy sharpshooter, gets a job at a traveling carnival, meets a biker chick, breaks up with the biker chick, and fall in love and marry the woman of his dreams, Marie Kimble (Bernadette Peters). Of course, Navin ends up losing everything and that's why he's a jerk.THE JERK wasn't Steve Martin's first movie, but it was his first starring role in a feature film and introduced the style of comedy he was doing on the comedy circuit to a broader audience. The movie is filled with all kinds of jokes from witty one-liners, poop jokes, sexual innuendo, slapstick, and a lot of crazy nonsense.There were moments of THE JERK that I really enjoyed, but there was a lot of stuff that was just plain stupid. Of course, there's a lot of material in the film that no one would be able to get away with today. Steve Martin always was more than just a &#34;Wild and Crazy Guy.&#34; He's an intellectual at heart and one can see snippets of that side of Martin in THE JERK. Unfortunately, it's overshadowed by the type of comedy Martin was doing on the comedy circuit that appealed mainly to teenagers and college students. Actually, the reason I ended up liking THE JERK wasn't because of Martin at all, it was because of Bernadette Peters. Peters is one of the finest actresses of all time--she can do serious drama or slapstick comedy and do it better than any other actress. She's a classy lady with a broad charm. Martin is the star of THE JERK, but the film would not have been able to stand if it wasn't for Peters.THE JERK is a must-see movie for Martin or Peters fans. It's also a movie that people who enjoy lowbrow humor will probably like. The film's largest audience at the time it was released was college students and teenagers.

Navin discovers he does have rhythm after all (""praise the Lord!"") when he listens to a radio playing dance music from the time. Navin eats his Twinkies, learns the difference between sh-t and Shinola and hits the road hoping to be rich. Armed with the advice his family gives him (""God bless the working man...and remember never trust whitey!""). He hitchhikes getting his first ride which takes him to the end of a fence getting about twenty feet away from home. Needless to say, life is more than an adventure for Nathan and his dog Shithead; it's a vocation.Receiving a very nice transfer, ""The Jerk"" looks typical of a film from the late 70's with noticeable film grain and while the colors aren't quite as vivid as I would have thought, they're acceptable. This is the first widescreen presentation for the film so that's something to be thankful for. There's quite a bit of analog debris in the form of dirt (in fact it looks as if this is exactly the same transfer as the previous edition). The 5.1 remastered Dolby Digital Surround Sound mix has nice presence but (not surprisingly) it doesn't use the format particularly well.In addition to the original production notes from the previous edition and theatrical trailer we also get 1 extra and 1 featuring footage cut from the film. ""The Lost Filmstrips of Father Carlos Las Vegas De Cordova"" is a ""continuation"" of the film within a film where we see Martin play various characters doing things like verbally abusing a plant, dressing a bulldog in a clown suit as the audience cheers and takes pets in a bizarre parody of cock fighting. It's really footage that was cut from that sequence. ""Learn to Play `Tonight You Belong to Me'"" includes sections where you can learn to tune a ukulele (something I've been dying to learn), play it, play along with the Ukulele Gal and, finally, play along with the jerk himself. It's bizarre to say the least. The last bit is just a scene from ""The Jerk"" where Navin serenades his sweetheart at the beach.No commentary track from Martin or Reiner. Honestly, you'd think they were embarrassed by this film! Or, maybe they weren't asked to do it or wanted too much money. While an improvement on the original edition of the film, that improved is slight at best. The featurettes are pleasant diversions but the real reason to get ""The Jerk"" is that this is the first time it's been presented in widescreen. The image quality could have been cleaned up quite a bitas there's quite a bit of analog debris that appears early on in the film. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this unless you're dying to have the widescreen version of this classic comedy.",5,"Movie deserves 5 stars while ""Anniversary"" edition 2",1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,3465,"['Surreal', 'point', 'silliness', 'Jerk', 'captured', 'atmosphere', 'comedy', 'perfectly', '70', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'broke', 'larger', 'audience', 'big', 'little', 'screen', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'was', 'JERK', 'As', 'dense', 'brick', 'Martin', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'act', 'jerk', 'become', 'one', 'Opening', 'variation', 'Hollywood', 'tales', 'where', 'hero', 'story', 'down', 'luck', 'soon', 'be', 'redeemed', 'course', 'comedy', 'unlikely', ""'ll"", 'get', 'redemption', 'expect', 'well', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'funny', 'Navin', 'Johnson', 'Martin', 'mentions', 'beginning', 'was', 'poor', 'black', 'child', 'Adopted', 'poor', 'African-American', 'family', 'living', 'poverty', 'Navin', 'horrified', 'discover', 'not', 'only', 'adopted', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'Caucasian', 'have', 'absolutely', 'rhythm', 'Navin', 'have', 'rhythm', 'praise', 'Lord', 'when', 'radio', 'playing', 'dance', 'music', 'time', 'Twinkies', 'difference', 'sh-t', 'Shinola', 'road', 'hoping', 'be', 'rich', 'Armed', 'advice', 'family', 'God', 'working', 'man', 'remember', 'never', 'trust', 'whitey', 'getting', 'first', 'ride', 'end', 'fence', 'getting', 'twenty', 'feet', 'away', 'home', 'Needless', 'say', 'life', 'more', 'adventure', 'Nathan', 'dog', 'Shithead', 'vocation.Receiving', 'very', 'nice', 'transfer', 'Jerk', 'typical', 'film', 'late', '70', 'noticeable', 'film', 'grain', 'colors', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'vivid', 'would', 'have', 'thought', ""'re"", 'acceptable', 'first', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'film', 'something', 'be', 'thankful', 'quite', 'bit', 'analog', 'debris', 'form', 'dirt', 'fact', 'exactly', 'same', 'transfer', 'previous', 'edition', '5.1', 'remastered', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'mix', 'nice', 'presence', 'not', 'surprisingly', ""n't"", 'use', 'format', 'particularly', 'well.In', 'addition', 'original', 'production', 'notes', 'previous', 'edition', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'also', 'get', '1', 'extra', '1', 'featuring', 'footage', 'cut', 'film', 'Lost', 'Filmstrips', 'Father', 'Carlos', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'De', 'Cordova', 'continuation', 'film', 'film', 'where', 'see', 'Martin', 'play', 'various', 'characters', 'doing', 'things', 'verbally', 'abusing', 'plant', 'dressing', 'bulldog', 'clown', 'suit', 'audience', 'cheers', 'pets', 'bizarre', 'parody', 'cock', 'fighting', 'really', 'footage', 'was', 'cut', 'sequence', 'Learn', 'Play', 'Tonight', 'Belong', 'Me', 'sections', 'where', 'can', 'learn', 'tune', 'ukulele', 'something', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dying', 'learn', 'play', 'play', 'along', 'Ukulele', 'Gal', 'finally', 'play', 'along', 'jerk', 'bizarre', 'say', 'least', 'last', 'bit', 'just', 'scene', 'Jerk', 'where', 'Navin', 'sweetheart', 'beach.No', 'commentary', 'track', 'Martin', 'Reiner', 'Honestly', ""'d"", 'think', 'were', 'embarrassed', 'film', 'maybe', 'were', ""n't"", 'asked', 'do', 'wanted', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'improvement', 'original', 'edition', 'film', 'improved', 'slight', 'best', 'featurettes', 'are', 'pleasant', 'diversions', 'real', 'reason', 'get', 'Jerk', 'first', 'time', 'been', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'image', 'quality', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'quite', 'bitas', 'quite', 'bit', 'analog', 'debris', 'early', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'recommend', ""'re"", 'dying', 'have', 'widescreen', 'version', 'classic', 'comedy']",The Jerk
