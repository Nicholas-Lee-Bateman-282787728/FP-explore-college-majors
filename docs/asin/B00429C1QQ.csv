Every since I was a little girl I loved Fred Astaire, Shirley Temple and dancing in general etc.  Line dance looks like great fun.  The instructor is excellent in my opinion and I am learning a new thing which improves the brain cells. Also I am burning more calaries beside Kathy Smith workouts, Mari Winsor's pilates, and Callan's Callenetics which are really wonderful.  I like to be active and I enjoy variety.I recommend this to anyone who wants to branch out from their normal routine.

I have zero rhythm and can't dance at all - not even line dancing which is supposedly easier than some of the other styles. Yes, it's fun, but I get a little bit lost in it all (mostly because some of the transitions feel awkward to me). The music, as others have said, is terrible. Overall, the workout itself is not bad. I wouldn't recommend it, but I wouldn't tell someone not to get it (thus the three-star rating). I occasionally do it, and do sweat some, so I figure if I'm burning calories it doesn't matter if I get the moves exactly right as long as I'm not hurting myself in the process.",3,"Good if you like line dancing, bad if you're uncoordinated",1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,645,"['Basically', ""'m"", 'not', 'coordinated', 'enough', 'do', 'have', 'zero', 'rhythm', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dance', 'not', 'even', 'line', 'dancing', 'supposedly', 'easier', 'other', 'styles', 'Yes', 'fun', 'get', 'little', 'bit', 'lost', 'mostly', 'transitions', 'feel', 'awkward', 'music', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'terrible', 'Overall', 'workout', 'not', 'bad', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'would', ""n't"", 'tell', 'someone', 'not', 'get', 'thus', 'three-star', 'rating', 'occasionally', 'do', 'do', 'sweat', 'figure', ""'m"", 'burning', 'calories', ""n't"", 'matter', 'get', 'moves', 'exactly', 'right', 'as', 'long', ""'m"", 'not', 'hurting', 'process']",Dance Off The Inches: Country Line Dance Party

I was seriously disappointed when I watched it knowing that it was only for those that are familiar with the country dance steps & a quick learner.I've gotten very little use from this item because it has too many different types of dance steps, moves toooo fast & as she tells you 'right or left' & uses the names of the steps (you need to focus on the fact that she is facing you & you have to do the opposite directon), it is overwhelming to try & keep up & LOTS OF PRACTICE is needed before you are familiar with all of the steps & can actually follow the exercise portion of the DVD.  It also would have been helpful if she wasn't standing the opposite way while teaching the steps - know that you are learning the opposit way!On the positive side, the dance step are separate from the 'exercise' portion of the DVD & you can rewind/repeat as often as necessary.
