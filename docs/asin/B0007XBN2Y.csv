It was typical in the way it showed how true love can be right in front of you and if you aren't paying attention, you can miss it.  But in the end Danny and Melissa found their way back to each other, knowing that in their hearts, that is where they belonged all along.  The trials and tribulations that they experienced we're just to make them even more thankful when they returned to each other with open arms and hearts and experienced the true meaning of loving one another.",5,Pitcher and the Pin Up,1334966400,"04 21, 2012",2012,512,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'was', 'typical', 'way', 'showed', 'how', 'true', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'right', 'front', 'are', ""n't"", 'paying', 'attention', 'can', 'miss', 'end', 'Danny', 'Melissa', 'found', 'way', 'back', 'other', 'knowing', 'hearts', 'where', 'belonged', 'along', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'experienced', ""'re"", 'just', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'thankful', 'when', 'returned', 'other', 'open', 'arms', 'hearts', 'experienced', 'true', 'meaning', 'loving', 'one']",N/A

My wife brought the movie home.This movie is a real find. One of those romance movies that will touch your heart.The movie starts out with Danny Foster (Drew Johnson) and Melissa Curtis (Corinna Harney-Jones).They grow up together as best friends. However all the time she is in denial of their love for each other.He persues his baseball career and puts her initials on the mound everytime he pitches for good luck. She is simply unable to keep from thinking about him. I wont tell you much more about the movie because I dont want to ruin it. This is a movie that makes you feel good as you root for the two of them to finally be together.Watch this movie with that special someone in your life.,5,A very good love story,1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,786,"['other', 'day', 'video', 'store', 'wife', 'found', 'movie', 'hadnt', 'heard', 'much', 'My', 'wife', 'brought', 'movie', 'home.This', 'movie', 'real', 'find', 'One', 'romance', 'movies', 'will', 'touch', 'heart.The', 'movie', 'out', 'Danny', 'Foster', 'Drew', 'Johnson', 'Melissa', 'Curtis', 'Corinna', 'Harney-Jones', '.They', 'grow', 'up', 'together', 'best', 'friends', 'However', 'time', 'denial', 'love', 'other.He', 'baseball', 'career', 'initials', 'mound', 'everytime', 'good', 'luck', 'simply', 'unable', 'keep', 'thinking', 'wont', 'tell', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'dont', 'want', 'ruin', 'movie', 'feel', 'good', 'root', 'two', 'finally', 'be', 'together.Watch', 'movie', 'special', 'someone', 'life']",N/A

The  film was decent.I was mainly interested in the love story.I'm not interested in baseball, so those parts were sort of boring to me.I thought the love story was cute and sweet, but it took way too long for Danny and Melissa to get together.She wasted a lot of years that they could have had as a couple.After she had her baby, she waited like 4 years to see him again.I am puzzled as to why she waited so long.The one thing I thought was unnecessary was all the cursing done by  people in the film, none of them the main players. It was totally out of place in a sweet, innocent hopeful love story like this.It was also nice to see Corinna in something recent, especially a lead role.I also wondered if some of the film might have been based on her own experiences.Another reviewer said that she was happily married with two kids now and thats a nice thing to hear.",3,Cute Love Story but...,1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,960,"['bought', 'film', 'Corinna', 'Harney', 'was', 'always', 'one', 'favorite', 'Playmates', 'film', 'was', 'decent.I', 'was', 'mainly', 'interested', 'love', 'story.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'interested', 'baseball', 'parts', 'were', 'sort', 'boring', 'me.I', 'thought', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'cute', 'sweet', 'took', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'Danny', 'Melissa', 'get', 'together.She', 'wasted', 'lot', 'years', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'couple.After', 'had', 'baby', 'waited', '4', 'years', 'see', 'again.I', 'am', 'puzzled', 'why', 'waited', 'so', 'long.The', 'one', 'thing', 'thought', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'cursing', 'done', 'people', 'film', 'none', 'main', 'players', 'was', 'totally', 'place', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'hopeful', 'love', 'story', 'this.It', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'Corinna', 'something', 'recent', 'especially', 'lead', 'role.I', 'also', 'wondered', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'own', 'experiences.Another', 'reviewer', 'said', 'was', 'happily', 'married', 'two', 'kids', 'now', 'thats', 'nice', 'thing', 'hear']",N/A

Varga ""Tauren Guard""","[3, 6]","Recently, I acquired a dvd copy via ebay of Corinna Harney(-Jones)' movie, 'Pitcher And The Pin-Up'.I already noted the PG-13 rating on the back of the DVD box, so I knew not to expect nudity even though it's a B-movie starring a Playboy Playmate.The story is your basic two friends grow up together, get attracted to each other but don't express it, girl becomes Playmate of the Year, nice guy goes insane from all the crappy choices she makes in relationships in her life, nice guy goes into a coma, girl expresses herself in poetry but still not to him directly, guy comes out of a coma to make a complete recovery, girl marries a rock singer (gee, what a stretch for a playmate), he ruins his pitching arm, her marriage gets ruined, nice guy and girl hook up four years later, and they wind up in bed together using, in kind of a creepy way, the same lines they used to each other when they were 10 years old, kind of movie.The first hour is choppier than a bad hair day at Supercuts.  And, with apologies to Corinna, but, you don't look like a 16 year old.  Neither did the two guys playing her friends.  This is one of the main reasons why the first hour was so confusing, timeline-wise.  I guess hiring teen actors wasn't in the budget.The facial expressions the lead actor was giving were very bizarre.. kind of like Ben Stiller with constipation.Right around the time Corinna's character got pregnant, the chopiness subsided and the storyline was a lot easier to follow.I was surprised that the movie used Playboy and not some made up adult magazine name.  It made me wonder if this movie actually reflected off of Corinna's real life.  The last time I saw her (several years ago at a Glamourcon), she looked very happy in her 2 kids and a nice guy hubby world.  :)Overall, the acting was better than the majority of B movies that I've seen, and I've seen a LOT of them.  I would give this movie three stars out of five.There are no extras on the DVD, unfortunately, which is also why I didn't rate it higher.Movie warnings:  Profanity, almost but not quite topless scene (yes, by Corinna) toward the end of the movie, 30 second guest appearance by Playmate Daphne Duplaix, and several moments of flashback frustration for you nice guys out there.Question of the movie: Who would where a beige suit to their own wedding?  I know, I know.. low budget.  :)",3,bad deja vu for nice guys,1125187200,"08 28, 2005",2005,2363,"['Recently', 'acquired', 'dvd', 'copy', 'ebay', 'Corinna', 'Harney', '-Jones', 'movie', ""Pin-Up'.I"", 'already', 'noted', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'back', 'DVD', 'box', 'knew', 'not', 'expect', 'nudity', 'even', 'B-movie', 'starring', 'Playboy', 'Playmate.The', 'story', 'basic', 'two', 'friends', 'grow', 'up', 'together', 'get', 'attracted', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'express', 'becomes', 'Playmate', 'Year', 'nice', 'guy', 'insane', 'crappy', 'choices', 'relationships', 'life', 'nice', 'guy', 'coma', 'girl', 'expresses', 'poetry', 'still', 'not', 'directly', 'guy', 'coma', 'make', 'complete', 'recovery', 'girl', 'marries', 'rock', 'singer', 'gee', 'what', 'stretch', 'playmate', 'pitching', 'arm', 'marriage', 'ruined', 'nice', 'guy', 'girl', 'hook', 'up', 'four', 'years', 'later', 'wind', 'up', 'bed', 'together', 'using', 'kind', 'creepy', 'way', 'same', 'lines', 'used', 'other', 'when', 'were', '10', 'years', 'old', 'kind', 'movie.The', 'first', 'hour', 'choppier', 'bad', 'hair', 'day', 'Supercuts', 'apologies', 'Corinna', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', '16', 'year', 'old', 'did', 'two', 'guys', 'playing', 'friends', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'why', 'first', 'hour', 'was', 'so', 'confusing', 'timeline-wise', 'guess', 'hiring', 'teen', 'actors', 'was', ""n't"", 'budget.The', 'facial', 'expressions', 'lead', 'actor', 'was', 'giving', 'were', 'very', 'bizarre..', 'kind', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'constipation.Right', 'time', 'Corinna', 'character', 'got', 'pregnant', 'chopiness', 'subsided', 'storyline', 'was', 'lot', 'easier', 'follow.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'movie', 'used', 'Playboy', 'not', 'made', 'up', 'adult', 'magazine', 'name', 'made', 'wonder', 'movie', 'actually', 'reflected', 'Corinna', 'real', 'life', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'Glamourcon', 'looked', 'very', 'happy', '2', 'kids', 'nice', 'guy', 'hubby', 'world', 'Overall', 'acting', 'was', 'better', 'majority', 'B', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'LOT', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'three', 'are', 'extras', 'DVD', 'unfortunately', 'also', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'rate', 'higher.Movie', 'warnings', 'Profanity', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'topless', 'scene', 'yes', 'Corinna', 'end', 'movie', '30', 'second', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Playmate', 'Daphne', 'Duplaix', 'several', 'moments', 'flashback', 'frustration', 'nice', 'guys', 'out', 'there.Question', 'movie', 'Who', 'would', 'where', 'beige', 'suit', 'own', 'wedding', 'know', 'know..', 'low', 'budget']",N/A
