The interview clips are short, but usually interesting. Pat and Lyle Mays are the most articulate and interesting of the lot. Pat's comments on his relationship to music and the audience capture the essential of musical integrity. (Take that, Kenny G!) Paul Wertico, on the other hand, just shows a photo of his new baby and stammers out a few things...But on to the music. This tour promoted the ""We Live Here"" recording, one of my least favorite of the PMG offerings. About half of the tunes have quite a pop feel. Some of these include the dreaded drum machine. There is more voice (but never words or scat) than on any other PMG recording I can remember. Nevertheless, even this ""We Live Here"" material is well done and has the added dimension of spontaneity and creativity when performed live. The two singers play an amazing host of instruments as well (brass, vibes, guitar, accordian, etc.), which add a pleasing colar and texture. Several PMG standards, such as ""First Circle,"" are featured and played excellently. The low point is ""This is Not America,"" which is not jazz by any standard. It's chief virtue is that it is short.To my knowledge, ""Scrap Metal"" has never been recorded on CD. It is an ""outside"" or intense free jazz kind of piece, probably influenced by Pat's association with saxophonist and composer Ornette Coleman (""Song X""). It features Wertico on drums, who relies more a bit much on special effects (cowbells that trigger samples) and a mountain of cymbols. Give me a well-crafted jazz solo on a small kit (say, Max Roach, Elvin Jones, Roy Haynes) any day.Pat is in very good form. He takes off in full flight on the final piece, which features a quick guitar chop as the main phrase. Despite my complaints, seeing this much of Pat's playing makes the video worthwhile. Nevertheless, I'd take a video of a Pat Metheny Trio date any time, since that allows him to improvise more freely and interact with the other musicians in way truer to the ambience of jazz.Douglas Groothuis",4,Excellent production; group in good form; not the best music,992908800,"06 19, 2001",2001,2142,"['dedicated', 'long-term', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'fan', 'can', 'say', 'concert', 'interview', 'video', 'well-produced', 'satisfying', 'overall', 'interview', 'clips', 'are', 'short', 'usually', 'interesting', 'Pat', 'Lyle', 'Mays', 'are', 'most', 'articulate', 'interesting', 'lot', 'Pat', 'comments', 'relationship', 'music', 'audience', 'capture', 'essential', 'musical', 'integrity', 'Take', 'Kenny', 'G', 'Paul', 'Wertico', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'photo', 'new', 'baby', 'stammers', 'out', 'few', 'things', 'music', 'tour', 'promoted', 'Live', 'Here', 'recording', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'PMG', 'offerings', 'half', 'tunes', 'have', 'quite', 'pop', 'feel', 'include', 'dreaded', 'drum', 'machine', 'more', 'voice', 'never', 'words', 'scat', 'other', 'PMG', 'recording', 'can', 'remember', 'Nevertheless', 'even', 'Live', 'Here', 'material', 'well', 'done', 'added', 'dimension', 'spontaneity', 'creativity', 'when', 'performed', 'live', 'two', 'singers', 'play', 'amazing', 'host', 'instruments', 'well', 'brass', 'vibes', 'guitar', 'accordian', 'etc', 'add', 'pleasing', 'colar', 'texture', 'Several', 'PMG', 'standards', 'such', 'First', 'Circle', 'are', 'featured', 'played', 'excellently', 'low', 'point', 'Not', 'America', 'not', 'jazz', 'standard', 'chief', 'virtue', 'short.To', 'knowledge', 'Scrap', 'Metal', 'never', 'been', 'recorded', 'CD', 'outside', 'intense', 'free', 'jazz', 'kind', 'piece', 'probably', 'influenced', 'Pat', 'association', 'saxophonist', 'composer', 'Ornette', 'Coleman', 'Song', 'X', 'Wertico', 'drums', 'who', 'more', 'bit', 'much', 'special', 'effects', 'cowbells', 'trigger', 'samples', 'mountain', 'cymbols', 'Give', 'well-crafted', 'jazz', 'solo', 'small', 'kit', 'say', 'Max', 'Roach', 'Elvin', 'Jones', 'Roy', 'Haynes', 'day.Pat', 'very', 'good', 'form', 'off', 'full', 'flight', 'final', 'piece', 'quick', 'guitar', 'chop', 'main', 'phrase', 'complaints', 'seeing', 'much', 'Pat', 'playing', 'video', 'worthwhile', 'Nevertheless', ""'d"", 'take', 'video', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'Trio', 'date', 'time', 'improvise', 'more', 'freely', 'interact', 'other', 'musicians', 'way', 'truer', 'ambience', 'jazz.Douglas', 'Groothuis']",Pat Metheny Group: We Live Here

The musicianship is excellent.  And the whole package works.Despite the negative reviews, I didn't find anything to complain about.  I think this is probably the best song selection on a DVD by the group, although the More Travels Live CD is also excellent.Pat has changed significantly since this era, and true fans would do well to own this DVD as a reminder of a golden period in the group's evolution.This, in retrospect, is a good dividing line before what followed, a great deal of experimentation and departure from the 1989-1995 period where Pat and the group found the right groove and balance between experimentation and commercial success.There is plenty of finger work to look at, although more would have been better, and a bit of slow motion for us guitar guys to figure out what the heck he's doing would have been even more fantastic.Highlights for me are ""Here To Stay,"" ""Have You Heard,"" and ""Vidalia.""Well worth owning, and playing over and over again.",5,The Sweet Spot Between Experimentation And Accessibility,1101513600,"11 27, 2004",2004,1107,"['excellent', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'companion', 'nice', 'glass', 'wine', 'relaxing', 'evening.You', 'get', 'good', 'classic', 'songs', 'musicianship', 'excellent', 'whole', 'package', 'works.Despite', 'negative', 'reviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'complain', 'think', 'probably', 'best', 'song', 'selection', 'DVD', 'group', 'More', 'Travels', 'Live', 'CD', 'also', 'excellent.Pat', 'changed', 'significantly', 'era', 'true', 'fans', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'own', 'DVD', 'reminder', 'golden', 'period', 'group', 'evolution.This', 'retrospect', 'good', 'dividing', 'line', 'what', 'followed', 'great', 'deal', 'experimentation', 'departure', '1989-1995', 'period', 'where', 'Pat', 'group', 'found', 'right', 'groove', 'balance', 'experimentation', 'commercial', 'success.There', 'plenty', 'finger', 'work', 'look', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'bit', 'slow', 'motion', 'guitar', 'guys', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'heck', 'doing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'fantastic.Highlights', 'are', 'Here', 'Stay', 'Have', 'Heard', 'Vidalia', 'Well', 'owning', 'playing', 'over', 'again']",Pat Metheny Group: We Live Here

The band of this DVD for me personally was my favorite incarnation of Pat's many performing line-ups.  The musicianship is simply outstanding and the song selection is just beautiful.  Though I was kind of hoping to see them perform ""Are You Going With Me"", ""Phase Dance"" or ""San Lorenzo"", the tracks they do perform are awesome.  I guess I'll just have to buy some other DVD's and look for those tracks.  I also own ""This Way Up"" which is also fantastic, and I've got on order a few more live DVD's.

581887,A1RD2TSQ2IE5LW,B00005IA89,Steven Sabin,"[1, 1]","As a HUGE Pat Metheny Group fan (I own 8 of their CDs and listen to them regularly), I have always wanted to see the PMG live, but this video was the closest I've gotten. Also, Pat has most recently been traveling as part of a trio or even just a duet...and I'm not sure if his days of traveling with the full 6- or 7-piece PMG ensemble will ever be resurrected or not. I just love the sonic textures that the larger group is able to achieve. Hence, my desire to see the ""old"" PMG in full force via this video.The audio production for this DVD was superb and follows amazingly close to the production values and orchestrations on the CD. With some album versus live performances, what you hear live is never as richly orchestrated or layered...as though it can only be produced in the confines of a studio rather than on the stage. Not so with this live performance. With the exception of the applause, you'd never know it was a live performance and has only minor departures from the CD, such as on some of the solos and a few endings.However, like other reviewers have mentioned here, I found the video portion to be a bit lacking and not up to the standards of excellence that you would expect from Pat.  I would have liked to see the interviews put into an ""extra features"" section at the end...rather than interspersed with the music. I also didn't like that the applause was often cut short...there were sort of abrupt and unnatural segues from one song to the next. I think just letting the cameras roll from one song to the next would have captured the feel of the concert better.I've always known Pat was serious about his music, but watching him play is a thing of beauty. His facial expressions leave no doubt that the connection from what he hears in his head to what he plays with his fingers is instantaneous and flawless. It's a part of his playing that you never experience until you actually see it.  It just adds an interesting extra dimension that makes you appreciate his mastery of the instrument all the more.From a purely musical perspective, I still enjoy the CD better than the DVD. However, the DVD gave me better insight into how the group creates such a large sonic presence...who plays what instruments during various parts of the songs...such as where the horns come in, or some of the background rhythm guitar work. It was also a joy to watch Paul Wertico on drums. The guy is simply amazing and I love his cymbal work.One thing I particularly like about Metheny/Mays compositions is the rhythmic complexity. Unlike so much popular music, they always mix things up with some interesting time signatures beyond the predictable 4/4, 6/8, and 3/4. Wertico navigates it all masterfully.The DVD does include a few songs not on the ""We Live Here"" CD  such as Antonia (from the album ""Secret Story"") and This is Not America (from ""The Falcon and the Snowman"" soundtrack).  Antonia is a particularly beautiful song...and Blamires comments in the video that Pat had him learn the accordian specifically so they could perform it in concert.One other thing the video did for me is connect names from the CD liner notes with actual faces and personalities. I feel like I know the group better now...guys like Steve Rodby, David Blamires, and Mark Ledford.In conclusion, although I'm planning to rent several other PMG videos as a result watching this one (I'm curious to see some of the newer members of the group like Antonio Sanchez, Cuong Vu and Richard Bona), unless the other DVDs are better than this one, I probably won't purchase any of them.  For me, the CDs deliver a more rewarding musical experience and the videos served mostly to fulfill a curiosity about what the group members looked like / played like.",3,"Great music, but video so-so",1165104000,"12 3, 2006",2006,3738,"['HUGE', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'Group', 'fan', 'own', '8', 'CDs', 'listen', 'regularly', 'have', 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'PMG', 'live', 'video', 'was', 'closest', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'Also', 'Pat', 'most', 'recently', 'been', 'traveling', 'part', 'trio', 'even', 'just', 'duet', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'days', 'traveling', 'full', '6-', '7-piece', 'PMG', 'ensemble', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'resurrected', 'not', 'just', 'love', 'sonic', 'textures', 'larger', 'group', 'able', 'achieve', 'Hence', 'desire', 'see', 'old', 'PMG', 'full', 'force', 'video.The', 'audio', 'production', 'DVD', 'was', 'superb', 'amazingly', 'close', 'production', 'values', 'orchestrations', 'CD', 'album', 'versus', 'live', 'performances', 'what', 'hear', 'live', 'never', 'richly', 'orchestrated', 'layered', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'produced', 'confines', 'studio', 'rather', 'stage', 'Not', 'so', 'live', 'performance', 'exception', 'applause', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'was', 'live', 'performance', 'only', 'minor', 'departures', 'CD', 'such', 'solos', 'few', 'endings.However', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'here', 'found', 'video', 'portion', 'be', 'bit', 'lacking', 'not', 'standards', 'excellence', 'would', 'expect', 'Pat', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'interviews', 'put', 'extra', 'features', 'section', 'end', 'rather', 'interspersed', 'music', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'applause', 'was', 'often', 'cut', 'short', 'were', 'sort', 'abrupt', 'unnatural', 'segues', 'one', 'song', 'next', 'think', 'just', 'letting', 'cameras', 'roll', 'one', 'song', 'next', 'would', 'have', 'captured', 'feel', 'concert', 'better.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'known', 'Pat', 'was', 'serious', 'music', 'watching', 'play', 'thing', 'beauty', 'facial', 'expressions', 'leave', 'doubt', 'connection', 'what', 'head', 'what', 'fingers', 'instantaneous', 'flawless', 'part', 'playing', 'never', 'experience', 'actually', 'see', 'just', 'interesting', 'extra', 'dimension', 'appreciate', 'mastery', 'instrument', 'more.From', 'purely', 'musical', 'perspective', 'still', 'enjoy', 'CD', 'better', 'DVD', 'However', 'DVD', 'gave', 'better', 'insight', 'how', 'group', 'large', 'sonic', 'presence', 'who', 'what', 'instruments', 'various', 'parts', 'songs', 'such', 'where', 'horns', 'come', 'background', 'rhythm', 'guitar', 'work', 'was', 'also', 'joy', 'watch', 'Paul', 'Wertico', 'drums', 'guy', 'simply', 'amazing', 'love', 'cymbal', 'work.One', 'thing', 'particularly', 'Metheny/Mays', 'compositions', 'rhythmic', 'complexity', 'so', 'much', 'popular', 'music', 'always', 'mix', 'things', 'up', 'interesting', 'time', 'predictable', '4/4', '6/8', '3/4', 'Wertico', 'masterfully.The', 'DVD', 'include', 'few', 'songs', 'not', 'Live', 'Here', 'CD', 'such', 'Antonia', 'album', 'Secret', 'Story', 'Not', 'America', 'Falcon', 'Snowman', 'soundtrack', 'Antonia', 'particularly', 'beautiful', 'song', 'comments', 'video', 'Pat', 'had', 'learn', 'accordian', 'specifically', 'could', 'perform', 'concert.One', 'other', 'thing', 'video', 'did', 'connect', 'names', 'CD', 'liner', 'notes', 'actual', 'personalities', 'feel', 'know', 'group', 'better', 'now', 'guys', 'Steve', 'Rodby', 'David', 'Blamires', 'Mark', 'Ledford.In', 'conclusion', ""'m"", 'planning', 'rent', 'several', 'other', 'PMG', 'videos', 'result', 'watching', 'one', ""'m"", 'curious', 'see', 'newer', 'members', 'group', 'Antonio', 'Sanchez', 'Cuong', 'Vu', 'Richard', 'Bona', 'other', 'DVDs', 'are', 'better', 'one', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'CDs', 'deliver', 'more', 'rewarding', 'musical', 'experience', 'videos', 'served', 'mostly', 'fulfill', 'curiosity', 'what', 'group', 'members', 'looked', '/', 'played']",Pat Metheny Group: We Live Here
