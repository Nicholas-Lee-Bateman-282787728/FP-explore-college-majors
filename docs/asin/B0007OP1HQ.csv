The reason for the four stars is because I believe they could have done so much more with this story and made it a bit longer.  With children they seem to like more action and there is action with this but it would have been nice to see more character emphasis.  I know I am writing this as an adult though so since the granddaughters liked it then it must have met their expectations.,4,Grandkids loved it!!,1348876800,"09 29, 2012",2012,494,"['bought', 'granddaughters', 'loved', 'just', 'anything', 'dinosaurs', 'reason', 'four', 'stars', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'made', 'bit', 'longer', 'children', 'seem', 'like', 'more', 'action', 'action', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'character', 'emphasis', 'know', 'am', 'writing', 'adult', 'so', 'granddaughters', 'liked', 'then', 'must', 'have', 'met', 'expectations']",Dinotopia - Quest for the Ruby Sunstone

884993,A3SZECLY107BY2,B0007OP1HQ,Luis A. Hernandez,"[0, 0]","My son is in love with this movie. I am not.I am not well versed in the Dinotopia Universe, but having watched the miniseries and read through the original book by James Gurney, I found that this film follows similar plots to those two. There is Dinotopia, a strange lost island where humans and dinosaurs live side by side in harmony, where the dinosaurs are intelligent and can speak for themselves. Also there are the sunstones which power all of Dinotopia, but are now failing for some reason. In this particular quest, there is a villain named Agthar who plans on using the power of the Ruby Sunstone to create an army of villainous dinosaurs to conquer all of Dinotopia.What I didn't like about the film is that the protagonist is a bratty kid with ubiquitous headphones and skateboard who shows up on the scene and already wants to take everything for granted. Also, there are the two antagonist dinos, which in reality are a bunch of greedy buffoons. The one dinosaur, a parasaurolophus voiced by Kathy Griffin, is constantly using language inappropriate for a small child, like ""you idiot!"", and ""What's that stupid kid think he's doing"" and then is either constantly committing violence or talking about it, such as ""remind me to hurt you later.""The main dinosaur character, a chasmosaurus named twenty six, is also a poor role model. She's vain, she's flighty, she's irresponsible.The only slightly likable character in the whole movie is Mara, voiced by Tara Strong. She has a more developed sense of morality, but often comes across as too bossy.I purchased this movie because my son loves dinosaurs, but after I watched it the first time, I was appalled at the poor scriptwriting, weak plot, and unlikely action. My son however feels differently. He has watched it at least seven times now, and when he's not watching it, he wants to act it out with his dino action figures. I guess what matters is that he enjoys it.",3,Obviously for the younger generation,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,1931,"['son', 'love', 'movie', 'am', 'not.I', 'am', 'not', 'well', 'versed', 'Dinotopia', 'Universe', 'having', 'watched', 'miniseries', 'read', 'original', 'book', 'James', 'Gurney', 'found', 'film', 'similar', 'plots', 'two', 'Dinotopia', 'strange', 'lost', 'island', 'where', 'humans', 'dinosaurs', 'live', 'side', 'side', 'harmony', 'where', 'dinosaurs', 'are', 'intelligent', 'can', 'speak', 'Also', 'are', 'sunstones', 'power', 'Dinotopia', 'are', 'now', 'failing', 'reason', 'particular', 'quest', 'villain', 'named', 'Agthar', 'who', 'using', 'power', 'Ruby', 'Sunstone', 'create', 'army', 'villainous', 'dinosaurs', 'conquer', 'Dinotopia.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'protagonist', 'bratty', 'kid', 'ubiquitous', 'headphones', 'skateboard', 'who', 'up', 'scene', 'already', 'take', 'everything', 'granted', 'Also', 'are', 'two', 'antagonist', 'dinos', 'reality', 'are', 'bunch', 'greedy', 'buffoons', 'one', 'dinosaur', 'parasaurolophus', 'voiced', 'Kathy', 'Griffin', 'constantly', 'using', 'language', 'inappropriate', 'small', 'child', 'idiot', 'What', 'stupid', 'kid', 'think', 'doing', 'then', 'constantly', 'committing', 'violence', 'talking', 'such', 'remind', 'hurt', 'later', 'main', 'dinosaur', 'character', 'chasmosaurus', 'named', 'twenty', 'six', 'also', 'poor', 'role', 'model', 'vain', 'flighty', 'irresponsible.The', 'only', 'slightly', 'likable', 'character', 'whole', 'movie', 'Mara', 'voiced', 'Tara', 'Strong', 'more', 'developed', 'sense', 'morality', 'often', 'across', 'too', 'bossy.I', 'purchased', 'movie', 'son', 'dinosaurs', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'appalled', 'poor', 'scriptwriting', 'weak', 'plot', 'unlikely', 'action', 'son', 'however', 'differently', 'watched', 'least', 'seven', 'times', 'now', 'when', 'not', 'watching', 'act', 'out', 'dino', 'action', 'figures', 'guess', 'what', 'matters']",Dinotopia - Quest for the Ruby Sunstone
