952371,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000BX8R1A,A Customer,"[4, 5]","Suburban malaise, teenage angst, and general family dysfunction is at the center of Chumscrubber, a darkly ironic and incongruous film that explores our often-times skewed middleclass values, our obsession with materialism, and the over-reliance on prescription drugs to medicate children, when perhaps all they really need is someone to talk to.It's a beautifully acted film, and has a terrific screenplay, and there's also lots of oddball characters thrown into the mix, but some viewers may find Chumscrubber a little to self-important and self conscious for it's own good. Adults act like selfish children; children act like egotistical adults, and self-obsession and miscommunication seems to be de rigor in this world of prefabricated suburbia.Dean (a wonderful Jamie Bell) is a reclusive thoughtful teenager, whose life is turned upside down when he discovers that his best friend Troy (Josh Janowicz), the school drug supplier has hung himself. Anxious to get their hands on his hidden stash, a group of kids at school decide to blackmail Dean by planning to kidnap his younger brother, Charlie (Rory Culkin).Billy (Justin Chatwin), Crystal (Camilla Belle), and Lee (Lou Taylor Pucci) hopefully will be able force Dean to come up with the drugs; the problem is that they kidnap the wrong Charlie (Thomas Curtis). Meanwhile, Terri (Rita Wilson) Charlie's an obnoxious interior designer mother, is just so focused on her upcoming remarriage to Michael, (Ralph Fiennes) the town's increasingly wimpy mayor that she doesn't notice her child is missing.But Dean has problems of his own: plagued with grief over his best friend's death, he keeps taking prescription drugs forced on him by his pop-psychiatrist Dr. Phil-like father (William Fichtner), whose self-help book empire is threatened by Dean's pathological lack of interest. His self-obsessed mother (Allison Janney) is also hectically running her own show, too busy peddling her own new age vitamin supplement business, and is oblivious to Dean's problems.Carrie, the mother of Troy (Glenn Close) wanders the neighborhood in a daze, returning dishes, madness blooming in her eyes, but no one bothers to reach out to her. Terri's wedding is planned for the same time that Carrie has scheduled her son's memorial, thus dividing the cul-de-sac neighbors over which event to attend. And Officer Lou Bratley (John Heard) is planning ways to disrupt that wedding and get Terri back, whilst Jerri (Carrie-Ann Moss) is trying to stay young by flirting with her daughter's friends; and Mayor Michael tries desperately to connect spiritually with the world around him.It's all terribly dysfunctional as director Arie Posin manages to walk a fine line between satire and serious drama. But Chumscrubber works, and whilst the acidic comments on suburban life are nothing new, the film has an edgy, and darkly mordant humour that saves it from mediocrity.  Tribute must also be given to Posin's talent as a director that he can assemble such a fine cast - all the actors perform magnificently, a deft mixture of the oddly amusing and the darkly touching.

952373,A2GANR9I6XHTU9,B000BX8R1A,Amy Lynn,"[9, 25]","The Story surrounds a kid named Dean living in the California Suburbs. One day during a neighborhood party Dean discovers his best friend Troy in his room dead from a suicide. Dean walks away from the party not telling anyone his friend just commited suicide.Everyone seems so wrapped up in themselves and their superficial lives they dont even notice whats going on around them. Even after they find out the boy is dead they still act nonchalant and careless. The story then ties in with 3 bullies at the school Dean goes to - they want Dean to go to Troys house and get some drugs they say he has in his room. When Dean dosent cooperate they kidnap a boy who they think is Deans little brother. They get the wrong kid. Soon Dean is trying to save the kid whos kidnapped. During all this the adults are oblivious to whats going on around them , they are trapped in their own worlds, seems like they dont care about anyone but themselves. Even their kids. Their solution to dealings with the kids problems is giving them some pills to make them feel better. Lots of pill popping throughout the film.The ''Chumscrubber'' is a comic book/video game character- a decapitated teenager thats a pop culture icon. I was watching this film thinking when is this going to get good? whats the point? This can be considered a donnie darko-esque picture for 2005- though nowhere near as good as Darko. A slice of pop culture for the new millenium. They had enough flat screen tv's, cell phones, futuristic video games.Only reason i call this donnie darkoesque is because it has the pop culture. Donnie Darko had that special ''somthing'' , this film dosent. It will leave you disapointed and confused. Not confused in a good way like Donnie Darko did. You could actually sit there and contemplate that film and be interested. This one lacks in so many areas it cant even be compared to Donnie Darko or American Beauty. Donnie Darko captured the era of the 80s, the music, the atmosphere and had an interesting story to boot - this one captures ''2005''with the technology and atmosphere but the story and plot is nowhere near as compelling as Darko. I was suprised to see some of these great actors in this film. Their performances didnt impress me like Kevin Spacey in american beauty or Jake Gylenhal as Darko. For example Glenn Close, Ralph Fiennes and Rita Wilson. Overall i would not recomend this film. 2.5-3 stars. Rent then decide.",3,Rent First..

952374,ARA48345JZPZR,B000BX8R1A,Archmaker,"[6, 8]","It's amazing how a film can be off just enough in tone or characterization that the whole construct fails, but that's the way this film struck me.  Attempting to tread the same turf as American Beauty, a dark comedy of suburbia, this one just didn't hit the right notes.  It was too serious and pretentious for satire and yet it presented satirical characters, mostly as the parents, and instead of being insightful or amusing or even touching, it was dissonant throughout.  It just didn't hang together.There were some good moments and this is a first rate cast, but it was as if they were all playing in a different movie.  Glenn Close was in a tragedy while Jason Isaacs, Rita Wilson and William Fichtner were in an over-the-top satire, while Ralph Fiennes and the others were somewhere else entirely.  And, meanwhile Jamie Bell and the other kids are doing some kind of melodrama.I suppose there are plenty of spineless and ineffectual parents and over-indulged, privileged little twerps popping pills and living in what looked to me to be pretty nice neighborhoods to identify with these overdrawn characters, but I ain't one of them.  The satire wasn't funny or insightful, the comedy very minor, the drama undone by the uneven tone.  Too bad, there are some wonderful actors here, especially the youngsters.PS I suppose all the British actors in this think this is the real America.

952375,AT94ICL01YHU0,B000BX8R1A,"Automated Message ""estrus jones""","[0, 7]","There are so many things wrong with this movie that it's hard to know where to begin. First off, it has nothing to do with fishing other than there's a mayor who wants to run with the dolphins like John C. Lilly -- that or he just has a wet sock fetish, which doesn't happen often in fishing because most fishermen don't wear socks or even shoes (maybe they're just in denial).Secondly, the whole thing is basically just a trailer for a video game where some superhero zombie slays bad-guy zombies while wearing Lite-Brite sneakers and carrying his head -- it somehow got cut off after he hung himself, which he did because he had poor taste in music. For some reason, at least according to Arie Posin (who went on from ""Chumscrubber"" to direct absolutely squat) when you talk with a cut-off head, you sound like the bunny from ""Donnie Darko"". Go figure. And how many zombies do you think you would slay while carrying your head around? It's all pretty stupid in a ""pass the bong"" kind of way.Thirdly, who cries at their drug dealer's funeral? I understand that this film was supposed to be an exercise in aggro-dysfunctionalism, but the part at the end where our protagonist (patterned after Cameron from ""Ferris Bueller"" in full wuss mode) gets all misty-eyed over the pusher man was the one scene that was meant to be realistic.

952376,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000BX8R1A,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","The Chumscrubber (don't even ASK me what that word means if it even *is* a word) is probably the weirdest movie I've seen in quite some time.The description is a bit inaccurate as well.  A troubled teen goes to investigate why his friend committed suicide.  Not quite.  He doesn't really investigate much, at least, not in a way you'd probably think he would.What's interesting is that, after the one teen discovers that his friend had killed himself, he doesn't even acknowledge his death.  No shocking look on his face, no crying, no anything... at least, that's how it seems initially.  He doesn't even tell the boys parents what happened.  In fact, he walks right by the parents, and leaves the house.Now what's MOST interesting is how the movie seems to work as an extremely dark comedy.  The writers were trying to go for an unintentional kind of humor with a ton of... not necessarily twists, but very very bizarre events.  Let me list some of them:- The mother of the boy who killed himself... she keeps telling people that she doesn't blame them, or hold them responsible, for her son killing himself.  It's really strange to say the least.  You sort of feel like laughing because of the way the mother keeps saying it over and over again, and because of the way she persistently delivers the line, but would it be RIGHT to laugh?  I honestly don't know.- Another similar moment would be whether it's appropriate or not to laugh when the mother of the teen who killed himself found herself in a bizarre situation where her neighbors were planning to have a wedding the same day she was planning to have the funeral for her son, and the man and woman getting married acted like they were annoyed at the fact the funeral was going to be held the same day as the wedding.- Most of the film actually focuses on about three different sets of parents, and dealing with their own personal and highly uncharacteristic problems.  One couple doesn't even REALIZE their son had been kidnapped by a bunch of teens giving a classmate a hard time (I'll explain this part in a minute).The storyline focuses quite a bit on the parents going about their lives completely unaware their son is missing.  The father, for some strange reason, gets this brilliant idea to stay up all night painting dolphins all over the living room walls and when his wife wakes up, she hates the dolphins and tries covering up the walls with blankets.  When the cops come over... well I won't spoil it, but this part was obviously funny.  Other parents/families had their own problems and situations that can only be described as... different.- The second part of the storyline was the kidnapping involving the WRONG person.  A group of teens get this idea to kidnap their classmates brother... but they pick up the wrong kid, haha.  So when the story shifts to these segments, they are ALSO obviously funny because the boy who was kidnapped didn't initially care about it, and was willing to go along with it.  He changes his mind later though, when the teens who kidnap him get serious when they realize how much trouble they're in.The ending of the film makes sense, but I don't think it's appropriate to laugh at a certain scene that takes place near the very end.The Chumbscrubber is DEFINITELY not your ordinary storyline, haha.

This movie was just plain stupid.  It was not smart, funny, redeeming or ironic.  I couldn't wait for it to be over.  The only character I liked was the little kid who got kidnapped.  Everything else was just stupidly psychotic.  If a movie like this is supposed to be some ironic commentary on amoral, retarded suburban life than I think it achieved its purpose.  I personally would like to watch a film with a spine and characters who are deeply fleshed out and relatable on some human level without pandering to suicide and drug abuse by teens.

952381,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B000BX8R1A,Chris Kennison,"[11, 13]","Rarely am I affected by a movie these days like I was with THE CHUMSCRUBBER. Have you ever felt like you were talking and nobody was listening? Have you ever nodded your head as somebody told you a story, despite the fact that you were off on some other mind-induced adventure? We all walk through our lives with blinders on and single-minded self-indulgent goals and CHUMSCRUBBER explores this to the fullest.After watching about 40 minutes of CHUMSCRUBBER, I felt myself getting frustrated and angry at the endless circle of things that... if only communicated... would have and could have been corrected in this movie. Not unlike the real world, everybody is off in their own worlds, not listening to the people around them. Only concerned about Me, Myself & I. The characters on film wouldn't be in near the mess they were if they just stopped and listened and communicated. The people wouldn't be feeling near the inner pain they were feeling.I caught myself not liking the movie for making me feel this way. But then I smacked myself, understood why they did this and respected the movie for getting this emotion across. I believe that my initial reaction was due to the fact my movie watching brain has been watered down over the years with movies that DON'T MAKE ME FEEL ANYTHING. CHUMSCRUBBER reminds me what movies could and should do everytime.Jamie Bell plays Dean, a suburban kid who's a little off the beaten path, and after finding his best friend hanging from his bedroom ceiling, walks away from the scene without telling a soul and in essence bottles up the emotions that he's feeling. Thus establishing an on-going theme that carries throughout the film in nearly all of its characters.Dean's father, played by William Fichtner, a psychologist, prescribes drugs to his son instead of listen to him. His brother plays video games all day, off in his own little world and ends up doing something as a joke that nearly gets somebody killed. A young couple are so wrapped up in their wedding plans, that they don't realize their kid has been kidnapped for two days. The town sheriff laughs and mocks Dean as he tells him the elaborate story about the kidnapped kid, not knowing that the kidnapped kid is his own son. The suicide victim's mother struggles with her sanity because she didn't know her son.All this to make a very worthy and poignant statement about listening, communicating and the downfalls of self-importance.CHUMSCRUBBER is a fantastic little movie that grabs you and pulls emotions out of its pocket that will have you glued to its characters and their self important worlds.My only gripe is that there was a very odd and unnecessary video game, montage, here's where they are now ending that took away from the most powerful scene of the movie... when Dean confronts his emotions at his best friends memorial with his best friends mother, played by a phenominal GLEN CLOSE.For the first time in the movie, someone spoke, someone actually spoke and shared, and communicated and it made things all better.A very worthy point to top off a very worthy film.",4,It's FRUSTRATING when nobody listens,1141603200,"03 6, 2006",2006,3087,"['Rarely', 'am', 'affected', 'movie', 'days', 'was', 'CHUMSCRUBBER', 'Have', 'ever', 'felt', 'were', 'talking', 'nobody', 'was', 'listening', 'Have', 'ever', 'nodded', 'head', 'somebody', 'told', 'story', 'fact', 'were', 'off', 'other', 'mind-induced', 'adventure', 'walk', 'lives', 'blinders', 'single-minded', 'self-indulgent', 'goals', 'CHUMSCRUBBER', 'fullest.After', 'watching', '40', 'minutes', 'CHUMSCRUBBER', 'felt', 'getting', 'frustrated', 'angry', 'endless', 'circle', 'things', 'only', 'communicated', 'would', 'have', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'corrected', 'movie', 'Not', 'real', 'world', 'everybody', 'own', 'worlds', 'not', 'listening', 'people', 'Only', 'concerned', 'Me', 'Myself', 'characters', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'mess', 'were', 'just', 'stopped', 'listened', 'communicated', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'feeling', 'inner', 'pain', 'were', 'feeling.I', 'caught', 'not', 'liking', 'movie', 'making', 'feel', 'way', 'then', 'smacked', 'understood', 'why', 'did', 'respected', 'movie', 'getting', 'emotion', 'believe', 'initial', 'reaction', 'was', 'due', 'fact', 'movie', 'watching', 'brain', 'been', 'watered', 'down', 'years', 'movies', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'MAKE', 'ME', 'FEEL', 'ANYTHING', 'CHUMSCRUBBER', 'what', 'movies', 'could', 'should', 'do', 'everytime.Jamie', 'Bell', 'plays', 'Dean', 'suburban', 'kid', 'who', 'little', 'off', 'beaten', 'path', 'finding', 'best', 'friend', 'hanging', 'bedroom', 'ceiling', 'walks', 'away', 'scene', 'telling', 'soul', 'essence', 'bottles', 'up', 'emotions', 'feeling', 'Thus', 'establishing', 'on-going', 'theme', 'film', 'nearly', 'characters.Dean', 'father', 'played', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'psychologist', 'drugs', 'son', 'instead', 'listen', 'brother', 'video', 'games', 'day', 'off', 'own', 'little', 'world', 'up', 'doing', 'something', 'joke', 'nearly', 'somebody', 'killed', 'young', 'couple', 'are', 'so', 'wrapped', 'up', 'wedding', 'plans', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'kid', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'two', 'days', 'town', 'sheriff', 'laughs', 'mocks', 'Dean', 'elaborate', 'story', 'kidnapped', 'kid', 'not', 'knowing', 'kidnapped', 'kid', 'own', 'son', 'suicide', 'victim', 'mother', 'sanity', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'son.All', 'make', 'very', 'worthy', 'poignant', 'statement', 'listening', 'communicating', 'downfalls', 'self-importance.CHUMSCRUBBER', 'fantastic', 'little', 'movie', 'grabs', 'pulls', 'emotions', 'pocket', 'will', 'have', 'glued', 'characters', 'self', 'important', 'worlds.My', 'only', 'gripe', 'was', 'very', 'odd', 'unnecessary', 'video', 'game', 'montage', 'here', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'ending', 'took', 'away', 'most', 'powerful', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'Dean', 'emotions', 'best', 'friends', 'memorial', 'best', 'friends', 'mother', 'played', 'phenominal', 'GLEN', 'CLOSE.For', 'first', 'time', 'movie', 'someone', 'spoke', 'someone', 'actually', 'spoke', 'shared', 'communicated', 'made', 'things', 'better.A', 'very', 'worthy', 'point', 'top', 'off', 'very', 'worthy', 'film']",N/A

Arie Posen's first full-length movie does manage to be jaded without being heartless, dark without being self-conscious. Instead it's morbidly funny -- few movies can make drugs, kidnapping and mental collapse seem so entertaining.Dean (Jamie Bell) visits his drug-dealing pal Troy for some Prozac -- and finds Troy hanging from a noose. He simply walks out of the house, past a house-party full of adults. There's no point in telling them, because everyone around him is too preoccupied.In the days that follow, Troy is tormented by his classmates, and by his psychoanalytical dad, who is trying to make him feel grief against his will. But things take a nasty turn when school thug Billy (Justin Chatwin) demands that Dean turn over all of Troy's drugs... which he doesn't have. So he kidnaps Dean's little brother... except he gets the wrong kid.Instead, Billy has kidnapped the future stepson of the town mayor. Now Billy is threatening to kill the kid unless Dean turns over the drugs. Sooner or later, someone is going to go looking for him. Things come to a head at a wedding and a funeral -- fights will break out, confessions will be made, and the kidnapping erupts into violence that disrupts both the wedding and the funeral.Normally mental breakdowns and kidnappings aren't funny at all, but Arie Posen manages to make them seem that way. ""The Chumscrubber"" is full of weird, frighteningly plausible events like wedding-obsessed Terri failing to notice that her son is missing, or the kidnapped Charlie swimming with his kidnappers.Most of the movie is a buildup, with the various people running around in their little bubbles, oblivious to everybody else -- even to amoral teens kidnapping little kids. The dialogue is deliciously wry and warped (""I don't think you're crazy."" ""You know, there are several major book chains that would be willing to disagree with you on that point..."").With a movie this cynica, it's surprising that he final half hour is even a bit heartwarming. But it is, when Dean finally faces up to how he felt about Troy, talks to Troy's increasingly fragile mother, and karma catches up to certain people. And Posen manages it without losing that sense of twisted irony.The cast of characters aren't quite stereotypes, but they're definitely offbeat -- the kindly seductress, the dolphin-obsessed mayor, the mom obsessed with a ""perfect"" family and a little brother who pours powdered pills into food. But the best one here is Bell -- his numb, prickly acting is excellent, and he is nothing short of brilliant when he finally breaks down in his bedroom -- hallucinating about Troy.Dark, twisted and bizarre, ""The Chumscrubber"" is a truly hilarious dramedy about disconnected living.

952385,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B000BX8R1A,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","There is a lot to recommend this movie. It sports a great cast and most of them handle their characters well. The basic plot is good and borrows concepts from other movies which have been critically acclaimed, but in the end, it went so far I finally stopped believing it.The plot revolves around some teens and their families who live in an upscale community out west (Colorado?). The adults are so into themselves that the kids are pretty much left to themselves as far as development is concerned. The hero of the film finds that his best friend (the local drug supplier) has hanged himself. He can't even bring himself to tell the kid's mom who is busy hosting a party. The local bad guy wants the dead kid's stash of drugs and kidnaps another young boy to try and blackmail the hero into retrieving said drugs and handing them over.This sets up a series of events that get more peculiar by the scene.As I said, there is a fine cast here ( Carry Anne Moss, Glenn Close, John Heard, Ralph Fiennes just to name a few) who do a great job working the script. The sub-text explores much of the same territory as Tim Hunter's River's Edge and Over the Edge quite well. But the events get so bizzarre in carrying out these themes that as the film drew on I simply ceased to believe it. I cannot accept that some of the shocking events that unfold wouldn't jolt the characters out of their self-absorbtion.Another problem is that I saw the Movie Alpha Dogs not long ago. Alpha Dogs came out a year after this and the plot is nearly identical.(Do I hear the pitter patter of lawyers feet)? Alpha Dogs is a much better and certainly more believable movie.

952387,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B000BX8R1A,Get What We Give,"[3, 5]","The Chumscrubber is more than just an odd film - it's a hollow film. It's empty at its core. I know that is the intent of the film - to show that American suburban society has put a premium on individual happiness to the detriment of the children/and a breakdown of familial roles/bonds.I couldn't agree more. In fact, it's something I would stand up and cheer and even march for. However, I think that this film misses the mark in some of its key content.Rather than allow the film to present its subject matter frankly and the audience to perceive the quirks and the breakdown of the American family (as American Beauty did), The Chumscrubber comes across as almost surreal. Oh, that Jamie Bell finds his best friend dead - having hanged himself in his room - is real enough. His reaction is even real enough, if not requiring a bit more blatancy than provided. It's the remaining script that never feels quite right - quite true.The acting is fine - in fact, downright excellent at times. Glenn Close crafts a stellar performance out of a bare bones character. Allison Janney is really good given what she has to work with.The problem is that in order for the audience to mourn the loss the filmmakers want us to mourn, we must first know that something worthy of mourning, at one time, existed - that this is not just the surreal landscape that it appears to be. On this point they fail. We don't see children adversely affected by their parents' non-attention. We see children acting the way we see them acting every day in our neighborhoods and on the news reports. Is this normal? I believe the filmmakers wants us to realize it is NOT normal. But, we aren't given a barometer of what the filmmakers want us to see as ""normal"". Where is the family that DOES function? If there had been one of these presented then we might be more readily willing to see the emptiness that the remaining families display. As it stands, we must assume that this film reflects society as a whole and interpret what the meaning is. That is fine, except that it requires that the viewer have a familiarity with a ""normal"" functioning family in their own lives. That is becoming exceedingly rare these days.I don't know how the filmmakers managed to gather such a stellar cast of actors for this film, and I'm not going to ponder it too much either. However, the actors do a phenomenal job of turning a typical indie film into something intriguing. Jamie Bell is a truly gifted actor and he allows us to see beneath his empty personnae. But why does the boy who initiates the kidnapping act the way he does? Oh, sure, it's to get the drugs he wants, but that is only the operant reason, what's the underlying reason he acts the way he does? We almost get to see this, but the director cuts away from this and we're left wondering what is happening.

952388,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B000BX8R1A,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[0, 0]","Ari Posin and Zac Stanford had met years before at a film festival in Houston. They became pals and collaborated on this film, with Zac doing most of the writing, and Ari sitting in the director's chair. One executive producer, Bonnie Curtis, had worked for years for her mentor Steven Spielberg. She took the CHUMSCRUBBER script to him, and he liked it, seeing many of the obvious plot parallels to DREAMWORKS mega-hit, AMERICAN BEAUTY (1999). He shared some comments on what he thought was a third act that seemed much too busy with a swirl of storylines. He did like the fact that CHUMSCRUBBER was very ""edgy"", that it pushed the edge of the envelope. When they filmed BEAUTY, they assumed that it would be completely a comedy, but it morphed into some tremendously dramatic moments. CHUMSCRUBBER had the same kind of dichotomy going for it, even though it was more surreal. Its characters, especially the teenagers could have stepped out of the script for DONNIE DARKO (2001).CHUMSCRUBBER was the feature film debut for director Ari Posin, paralleling Sam Mendes who directed BEAUTY as his feature debut. Posin had graduated from USC a decade earlier, and this film was his first shot at the Hollywood brass ring. His father had been a film director in Russia, before the family fled the repression there and came to America. So Posin grew up in a home where the dinner conversation was centered squarely on cinema. He co-wrote the script, and he understood the necessity to cast strong actors who could meet the challenges on the page. Following Elia Kazan's advice, he tried  not ""to direct too much"" -the cardinal sin for most first time directors.Suburbia is the ""world"" of this dramedy -a sanitized new ticky-tacky housing development called ""Hillside""; the place to play out this dystopian vision. Perhaps it does not play out as heartbreakingly as Gus Van Sant's ELEPHANT (2003), or as realistically, but it is teeming with middle-aged parental characters who must have watched way too much OZZIE & HARRIET, DONNA REED, and FATHER KNOWS BEST reruns. They should have paid more attention to the disturbing goings on along Wisteria Lane on DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, or re-watched THE STEPFORD WIVES (1975), THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998), or even THX 1138 (1971).Jamie Bell [BILLY ELLIOT (2000)] played young protagonist Dean Stiffle with a perfect pitch American accent. His ""Dean"" was a recognizable adolescent, but further burdened with being both an outsider and rebel, and  having a father who was a New Age guru, who used his family's ""dysfunctions"" to write about; especially Dean's. So Dean, like most of his compeers found solace in the swirling miasma of pharmacology that was readily available at their middle class high school. Being stoned led to an easier pretense of ""good behavior"" which kept their parents clueless as to their actual behavior. The parents in this suburb were mostly selfish, inebriated, arrogant, and ignorant, practicing several forms of abandonment effortlessly.Camilla Belle played Crystal, and she was as beautiful as a young Angelina Jolie in HACKERS (1995), and as stunning as the young Elizabeth Taylor in A PLACE IN THE SUN (1951). Belle played Crystal very self-aware of being the prettiest girl in school, mired in shallow selfishness and rebellion, yet nevertheless she began to show indications that she might be ""growing up"", that she might actually be receptive to an honest communication, logic, and tenderness. For a long time she hung out with a cruel posse of drug dealers and ""rinks"", girlfriend to their leader Billy (played impressively by Justin Chatwin). Billy turned out to be both bully and victim.The supporting cast consisted of a number of talented actors, many of them brought on board secondary to the charm of the young director, and some because they liked the irreverent and necessary messages of the film. Ralph Fiennes, Glenn Close, Carrie-Ann Moss, Rita Wilson, Allison Janney, William Fichtner, Rory Culkin, John Heard, and Lauren Holly were the ""dream cast"". Most of the major film critics disliked the film, and felt that the cast were slumming in this ""pretentious Indie"" film. I disagree.

952389,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000BX8R1A,Grady Harp,"[5, 6]","Few films have polarized audiences (fortunate enough to have experienced this little film) as much as THE CHUMSCRUBBER, a film that is unique in its brave depiction of American suburbia, a place where 'things' have absorbed our attention and 'people' have all but melted into the woodwork.  It is a dark comedy, and even while it is very funny in parts, the humor is always attached to black vignettes that are so truthful they can become terrifying.Taking place in some manufactured instant suburb in sunny California, the story (by director and co-writer Arie Posin with Zak Stanford) is framed around one Dean Stiffle (Jamie Bell - think of the meaning of the word stifle!), a lad who seemingly is alone  among the hollow shells of high school kids who live through drugs/pills to alter their perception of a boring meaningless world.  The source of their pills is Troy Johnson (Josh Janowicz) who in the first frames of the movie is discovered by Dean after Troy has hanged himself in suicide.  Dean, though terrified at the horror of what he discovers, decides to not tell anyone 'because who would care anyway'.  Life just goes on among the parents of the teenagers, not allowing anything to disturb their shallow lives: Troy's mother (Glenn Close) appears oblivious to her loss; Dean's mother (Allison Janney) is more concerned with cooking and is clueless as to interpersonal relationships with anyone including her author/psychologist husband William Fichtner whose world begins and ends in his latest book; Terry Bratley (Rita Wilson) whose time is consumed by her incipient wedding to the mayor (Ralph Fiennes) who has delusional behavior while fending off maladaptive behavior by her recently divorced spouse Officer Lou (John Heard); Mrs. Falls (Carrie-Anne Moss) who seduces  even teenagers and any other man who comes into her gaze.  These shells of parents have no clue or communication with their aimless kids, but the kids when discovering the source of their pills is dead, decide to go after psycho Dean to get the stash.  In doing so they kidnap Charley whom they mistakenly think is Dean's brother to convince Dean to raid Troy's stash.  The manner in which all of this plays out is a veritable horror story of the amoral mindset of teenagers coping alone in the world with parents who elect to remain oblivious to their plights.There are some lapses in continuity with the story, some editing problems, and some weak moments, but the overall message is a very dark, very real microscopic examination of our society.  Jamie Bell is particularly outstanding as Dean, the only character who appears to have a remnant of conscience and soul.  But the cameos by the wide range of stars are splendid.  James Horner has once again managed to gel the story with his musical score, ending the credits with a rendition of the Graham Nash song ""Our House'. As said before, the audience is polarized between love and hate/tolerance for this film.  This viewer happened to love it. Recommended for all people concerned with our youth today - and their inadequate parents.

The movie opens with young loner Dean discovering his childhood best friend hanging from the rafters in his bedroom.  Dean gets little support from the adults in his world, and a group of teens quickly latches on to see if Dean can score the drug connections of his deceased friends.This is a tale told with subtle nuances and situational irony--the mothers pop speed and herbal energizers while turning a blind eye to their childrens' drug and alcohol abuse, the parents permit absolutely anything if ""it's for school,"" and a funeral and over-the-top wedding compete for space and attention on the McMansion block.  Kidnapping and bullying take place right under the eyes of a cast of self-absorbed parents played by Ralph Fiennes, Glenn Close, and Allison Janney.

The ""Chumscrubber"" is yet another in a long line of middle/upper class social satire flicks.  And yet this one seems to be polarizing--some camps claim it to be brave and true while others decry that it tries too hard and rings false.Well, I can see both points--but ultimately, I like in ""Chumscrubber"" what many were put off by.  It has a genuinely offbeat tone, bizarre yet matter-of-fact plotting, and a surrealness about even the most mundane of events.  I wouldn't claim it had a huge social significance as many of the more effusive reviewers do.  The characters here are clearly characters--there is a disconnect from real people.  But I think that works to the picture's advantage--this is a super-fictionalized setting.  Yet there are moments of sheer emotion that break through and thus are more effective because of the unreality of the situations.Those that know me might be confused at this point.  Realness is an important commodity to me, but I guess I take ""Chumscrubber"" in the vein of an entertaining fable.  And I was definitely entertained and intrigued by the film.  The cast is super.  Glenn Close, in an all too brief appearance, personifies emotional detachment and need at the same time.  Ralph Fiennes is amusing fluttering around the edge of sanity.  And Jamie Bell continues to be one of our more interesting performers--seemingly choosing in his roles to be an actor rather than a star.There is much unpleasantness in ""Chumscrubber"" from suicide, drugs, kidnapping--yet I don't find it to be a particularly downbeat film.  It does have an odd or different tone--but that's what stands out.  As many reviewers are quick to point out--it's not ""Donnie Darko.""  And they're right--but nor does it have to be to have value.  This seems to be a love it or hate it proposition.  I, for one, found a lot of merit, some insight and quite a bit of humor.

It's also been criticized for being too realistic on the one hand, and not realistic enough on the other. LOL (How is a director to win? :-) But it's actually a somewhat different idea; the best way to describe this movie is as if someone transferred the bizarre and nihilistic mid-20th century European theater of the absurd to new-millenium America. Donnie Darko had more sci-fi elements and one of the major themes of the movie--the existence of random evil and forces beyond our control in the world and what, if anything, can be done about it--isn't really an issue here.Whatever interpretation you happen to prefer, though, there's no doubt that all is not well beneath the highly polished surface of this otherwise prosperous, toney new neighborhood. The big, expensive homes and the trophy wives all signal that these people are the socio-economic winners in our society, but they are spectacular failures as people in every other sense.Most of the characters (whether the kids or the adults) seem to go thru life in a drug-induced haze, and the kids are running wild since there is no adult supervision. The adults are too busy with their sometimes delusional and usually narcissistic pursuits to bother with the kids, who basically concoct one wild escapade after another, from tracking down the local teenage drug dealer's stash when he dies to kidnapping one of the younger kids basically for sport. The whole story devolves into an orgy of narcissistic and self-indulgent excess by the end of the movie as each character spirals downward into his own personal 21st century, suburban hell.It's a little too pat, weird, and wacked out a movie to completely succeed as a vicious satire of contemporary America, but it is entertaining to watch, and the score is one of the most eerily and hauntingly beautiful I've ever heard, creating exactly the right mood and atmosphere throughout the film. The best way I can think to describe the music is a combination of sinister premonition and playfulness or dark humor, which suits the movie perfectly. It's a little hard to describe but you'll see what I mean when you hear it. I give it a solid four stars. I note a lot of people here didn't like it though, but would just say that if it's not your sort of movie, you'll know within 15 minutes of the opening scene if it's for you and you can turn it off at that point if it doesn't appeal to you.",4,"Dark, absurdist satire",1257379200,"11 5, 2009",2009,2554,"['quirky', 'dark', 'send-up', 'dysfunctional', 'surburban', 'American', 'neighborhood', 'been', 'unfavorably', 'compared', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'American', 'Beauty', 'also', 'been', 'criticized', 'being', 'too', 'realistic', 'one', 'hand', 'not', 'realistic', 'enough', 'other', 'LOL', 'How', 'director', 'win', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'different', 'idea', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'movie', 'someone', 'transferred', 'bizarre', 'nihilistic', 'mid-20th', 'century', 'European', 'theater', 'absurd', 'new-millenium', 'America', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'had', 'more', 'sci-fi', 'elements', 'one', 'major', 'themes', 'movie', 'existence', 'random', 'evil', 'forces', 'control', 'world', 'what', 'anything', 'can', 'be', 'done', ""n't"", 'really', 'issue', 'here.Whatever', 'interpretation', 'happen', 'prefer', 'though', 'doubt', 'not', 'well', 'highly', 'polished', 'surface', 'otherwise', 'prosperous', 'toney', 'new', 'neighborhood', 'big', 'expensive', 'homes', 'trophy', 'signal', 'people', 'are', 'socio-economic', 'winners', 'society', 'are', 'spectacular', 'failures', 'people', 'other', 'sense.Most', 'characters', 'kids', 'adults', 'seem', 'go', 'thru', 'life', 'drug-induced', 'haze', 'kids', 'are', 'running', 'wild', 'adult', 'supervision', 'adults', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'sometimes', 'delusional', 'usually', 'narcissistic', 'pursuits', 'bother', 'kids', 'who', 'basically', 'concoct', 'one', 'wild', 'escapade', 'tracking', 'down', 'local', 'teenage', 'drug', 'dealer', 'stash', 'when', 'kidnapping', 'one', 'younger', 'kids', 'basically', 'sport', 'whole', 'story', 'orgy', 'narcissistic', 'self-indulgent', 'excess', 'end', 'movie', 'character', 'spirals', 'downward', 'own', 'personal', '21st', 'century', 'suburban', 'hell.It', 'little', 'too', 'pat', 'weird', 'wacked', 'out', 'movie', 'completely', 'succeed', 'vicious', 'satire', 'contemporary', 'America', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'score', 'one', 'most', 'eerily', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'creating', 'exactly', 'right', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'think', 'describe', 'music', 'combination', 'sinister', 'premonition', 'playfulness', 'dark', 'humor', 'suits', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'little', 'hard', 'describe', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'hear', 'give', 'solid', 'four', 'stars', 'note', 'lot', 'people', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'would', 'just', 'say', 'not', 'sort', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'know', '15', 'minutes', 'opening', 'scene', 'can', 'turn', 'off', 'point', ""n't"", 'appeal']",N/A

It's also about surburbia's obsession with outer appearances and as such the movie struck me--in the beginning anyway--as rather trite and over familiar. After all, anyone who watches Weeds (Showtime), Real Housewives of Orange County, Desperate Housewives, etc., is getting a big dose of surburban malaise. Therefore, I was bored in the first fifteen minutes or so. But the film's gradual surrealism, which doesn't seem forced, grew on me. Perhaps what keeps it together is the sense of menace and danger. The plot is rather convoluted so I'll spare you the dizzying details but one plot point is that two high school thugs kidnap a ten-year-old boy and use him as ransom to get a huge stash of drugs from another high school boy. The kidnappers, nihilistic clowns, strike a real nerve as they seen like cast-offs of Generation Y, kids we really know.Perhaps the film is slow in places, so I'll take one star away but the film grows on you.

A Rubin,"[1, 2]","Having grown up in a 1960's suburb outside of Philadelphia with it's same-same split-levels and colonials, I can grasp the loneliness angle of a teen-angst film. Not as successful or lighthearted as Thumbsucker or honered as the silly and ""way"" overrated American Beauty, The Chumscrubber has charm.  Teens are lonely.  They do tend to rebel like James Dean.  Their parents work hard and acquire materialistic items such as homes, patio pools, and furniture, a stage of their life that emphasizes materialism and social status.  Suburbanites play hard and work hard, but teenager offspring are neither adults nor children.  The Chumscrubber world wheels in turn, humor and darkness.Jamie Bell somehow subdues his Scottish accent and plays the American teen with solemn seriousness.  Maybe that's a fault in his portrayal, but after all, there is not much fun in popping pills and having a best friend hang himself.  The parents, the kids, they seem to be whirling in separate orbits, coming close as the moon is large in a winter sky, but then the luminous returns to a distant trajectory.  They talk to each other, or rather pass each other.  The humorous scenes where the teens tell parents they are kidnapping a little boy so they can buy drugs compel laughs because the parents think the kids are attempting precocious satire.  The mother planning a wedding is oblivious.  She is the prototype suburban striver.  Where's your kid?  Oh, he's in his room, er.. out with friends on a school project.

952407,AEM0D3OFOR9RQ,B000BX8R1A,Sara,"[5, 9]","I felt the need to share my opinion after seeing the rating this film has gotten here. 'The Chumscrubber' passes the time well enough, but it's hardly five-star cinema.It attempts to be the next 'Donnie Darko', masquerading as a dark satire of suburban medication that quickly veers into ""after school special"" territory. The plot is convoluted and rather riduculous. A drug-addled teen discovers his friend's dead (from suicide) body and somehow gets involved in a ludicrous kidnapping scheme put together by the school bullies. It also follows various adults and parents in the neighborhood in their own self-involved escapades.With the caliber of the cast here I expected a lot more. While most of the adults perform well (particularly Glenn Close and Rita Wilson, who is quite hilarious, as well as the always great Ralph Fiennes and Carrie-Anne Moss), it gets a little iffy with the younger cast. I think Jamie Bell is an accomplished young actor, and his lead performance here did not dissuade me of that opinion. But I felt Justin Chatwin and Camilla Belle, as two of the kidnappers, were less than adequate. Chatwin cannot play nasty to save his life. Not once did I feel threatened by his character. And Belle performed on auto pilot. Her voice and facial expressions weren't what I'd call varied. I couldn't believe the actions of any of the characters and little of the script made sense. And the ending was just too much to be believed.There's nothing particularly wise or even that interesting about this film. If you're curious, go ahead and rent it. But I'd suggest you also pick up 'American Beauty', a much more accomplished portrait of suburban squall.",2,Just for a change of pace ...,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,1670,"['felt', 'need', 'share', 'opinion', 'seeing', 'rating', 'film', 'gotten', 'here', 'Chumscrubber', 'time', 'well', 'enough', 'hardly', 'five-star', 'cinema.It', 'attempts', 'be', 'next', ""'Donnie"", 'Darko', 'masquerading', 'dark', 'satire', 'suburban', 'medication', 'quickly', 'school', 'special', 'territory', 'plot', 'convoluted', 'rather', 'riduculous', 'drug-addled', 'teen', 'friend', 'dead', 'suicide', 'body', 'somehow', 'involved', 'ludicrous', 'kidnapping', 'scheme', 'put', 'together', 'school', 'bullies', 'also', 'various', 'adults', 'parents', 'neighborhood', 'own', 'self-involved', 'caliber', 'cast', 'here', 'expected', 'lot', 'more', 'most', 'adults', 'perform', 'well', 'particularly', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'who', 'quite', 'hilarious', 'as', 'well', 'always', 'great', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'little', 'iffy', 'younger', 'cast', 'think', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'accomplished', 'young', 'actor', 'lead', 'performance', 'here', 'did', 'not', 'dissuade', 'opinion', 'felt', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'two', 'kidnappers', 'were', 'less', 'adequate', 'Chatwin', 'can', 'not', 'play', 'nasty', 'save', 'life', 'Not', 'once', 'did', 'feel', 'threatened', 'character', 'Belle', 'performed', 'auto', 'pilot', 'voice', 'facial', 'expressions', 'were', ""n't"", 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'varied', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'actions', 'characters', 'little', 'script', 'made', 'sense', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'wise', 'even', 'interesting', 'film', ""'re"", 'curious', 'go', 'ahead', 'rent', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'also', 'pick', 'up', ""'American"", 'Beauty', 'much', 'more', 'accomplished', 'portrait', 'suburban', 'squall']",N/A

The ironic part is that the Chumscrubber's head is detached from his body, i.e. he is a mutant also, but doesn't realize he is part of the problem. This is symbolic of the community. Everyone lives in their own little idea world and ignores anything that would change it. The details in the movie is interesting as the people are neat freaks.

The screenwriter attempts to juxtapose serious and even tragic material next to flippant scenes of  suburbanites who have lost their minds in a haze that apparently represents either medication-induced obliviousness to what their children are up to, or some kind of new-age disconnect from reality. It doesn't work.  The quality of the script is at the level of a mediocre sitcom.  What little depth occurs is restricted to the main character, whose anguish is well played.  But we can hardly develop any emotional response since his anguish is continually interrupted by trite and silly scenes, such as having his dead friend's drug stash baked into a casserole to be served to the unsuspecting neighbors who attend his memorial service, thereby causing them to become sexually uninhibited.  Titter, titter. While the subject matter of kids using prescription drugs to the point of suicide and crime is certainly worthy of a script, this film caricatures suburban life so badly that it explains nothing.  I am amazed that they were able to corral  a respectable cast, but maybe times were hard in Hollywood.  The Chumscrubber can only be described as a failure at many levels.
