490167,AO37T54VEP0JQ,B000003K82,"B.C. Scribe ""trekviewer""","[1, 1]","Unusual, unique, and very satisfying this episode was a perfect follow-up to the intense fourth season opener 'The Way Of The Warrior'.  Alternately poignant, sad, profound and tragic this is one of the most offbeat and daring shows written for any of the Trek series.  In a genre that tends to adhere strictly to action, adventure, heroism and occasionally romance 'The Visitor' steps aside from all of these and creates an unforgettable story of a father and son bond.Jake Sisko, now an elderly gentleman, is alone in his house somewhere in the Louisiana Bayou country and is surprised to hear someone knocking on his door.  He lets in a soaked and shivering young woman from the rainstorm outside; she has a slight wound to her forehead that he tends to and he offers her a chair by the fire to warm herself.  She quickly confesses to him that she did not just happen along but that she had every intention of meeting him as she wants to be a writer also.  She praises him for his few books that he has written and asks him why he stopped writing so long ago.  He shares a personal and touching story with her about his father's death when he was 18, an event that has haunted him all his life, eventually absorbing him and emotionally crippling him we observe.  Jake altered his career choices without much forethought and at great cost to him and others he was very close to.Fascinating, compelling and often quite moving 'The Visitor' gets your attention immediately and doesn't let up at all.  As Jake tells the story we become completely engrossed by the details as well as the images onscreen; the accident onboard the Defiant that took his father's life; the funereal at DS9; Jake's sympathetic pleading with Kira to remain aboard the station when it is likely that soon it will be turned over to other authorities; his father's sporadic and puzzling reappearances to him throughout his life and the anguish he experiences because of it.  These and many other similar scenes really strike at the emotional center of the viewer as very few episodes of Trek ever have.  The final scene between Jake and his father with Jake explaining his choice and sacrifice should cause tears to well up in even the most stubborn of us.  The production team put forth an incredible effort, as you'll note throughout your viewing - the appropriate non-traditional music score and the use of light and shadow to accentuate the current moods of the characters.  Everyone featured turns in a meaningful and excellent performance, most especially Tony Todd as the elder Jake.  One of the most memorable scenes for me is when Kira approaches Jake to suggest he leave DS9; this significant moment is handled both touchingly and cheerlessly without being gloomy.  The powerful story is balanced with a little bit of scattered humor and some interesting 'growth development' for some of the DS9 regulars.  Nog is featured in the story as a Federation officer who assists his old friend Jake; Dax and Bashir are also featured as an aged pair helping to recreate the accident that took their friend and former captain Benjamin Sisko's life; the names of Quark, Rom and Morn are also name-dropped along with amusing updates.  This is one of the series very best episodes and only the coldest of hearts could not appreciate its warmth, sensitivity and upbeat message.Some additional notes: Tony Todd, arguably Trek's most versatile actor, has appeared as Worf's brother Kurn in the ST: TNG episodes 'Sins Of The Father' and the two-part 'Redemption' and still later on ST: DS9's 'Sons Of Mogh'; he was cast as the Alpha Hirogen in the Voyager episode 'Prey'.  Rachel Robinson, who appears as Melanie, is the daughter of DS9 regular Andrew Robinson (Garak).",5,What compels people to act in the name of love,1043798400,"01 29, 2003",2003,3737,"['Unusual', 'unique', 'very', 'satisfying', 'episode', 'was', 'perfect', 'follow-up', 'intense', 'fourth', 'season', 'opener', ""'The"", 'Way', 'Warrior', 'Alternately', 'poignant', 'sad', 'profound', 'tragic', 'one', 'most', 'offbeat', 'daring', 'shows', 'written', 'Trek', 'series', 'genre', 'adhere', 'strictly', 'action', 'adventure', 'heroism', 'occasionally', 'romance', ""'The"", 'Visitor', 'steps', 'aside', 'unforgettable', 'story', 'father', 'son', 'bond.Jake', 'Sisko', 'now', 'elderly', 'gentleman', 'alone', 'house', 'somewhere', 'Louisiana', 'Bayou', 'country', 'surprised', 'hear', 'someone', 'knocking', 'door', 'soaked', 'shivering', 'young', 'woman', 'rainstorm', 'slight', 'wound', 'forehead', 'chair', 'fire', 'warm', 'herself', 'quickly', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'happen', 'along', 'had', 'intention', 'meeting', 'be', 'writer', 'also', 'few', 'books', 'written', 'why', 'stopped', 'writing', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'shares', 'personal', 'touching', 'story', 'father', 'death', 'when', 'was', '18', 'event', 'haunted', 'life', 'eventually', 'absorbing', 'emotionally', 'crippling', 'observe', 'Jake', 'altered', 'career', 'choices', 'much', 'forethought', 'great', 'cost', 'others', 'was', 'very', 'close', 'to.Fascinating', 'compelling', 'often', 'quite', 'moving', 'Visitor', 'attention', 'immediately', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'Jake', 'story', 'become', 'completely', 'engrossed', 'details', 'as', 'well', 'images', 'onscreen', 'accident', 'Defiant', 'took', 'father', 'life', 'funereal', 'DS9', 'Jake', 'sympathetic', 'pleading', 'Kira', 'remain', 'station', 'when', 'likely', 'soon', 'will', 'be', 'turned', 'other', 'authorities', 'father', 'sporadic', 'puzzling', 'reappearances', 'life', 'anguish', 'many', 'other', 'similar', 'scenes', 'really', 'strike', 'emotional', 'center', 'viewer', 'very', 'few', 'episodes', 'Trek', 'ever', 'have', 'final', 'scene', 'Jake', 'father', 'Jake', 'explaining', 'choice', 'sacrifice', 'should', 'cause', 'tears', 'well', 'up', 'even', 'most', 'stubborn', 'production', 'team', 'put', 'forth', 'incredible', 'effort', ""'ll"", 'note', 'viewing', 'appropriate', 'non-traditional', 'music', 'score', 'use', 'light', 'shadow', 'accentuate', 'current', 'moods', 'characters', 'Everyone', 'featured', 'turns', 'meaningful', 'excellent', 'performance', 'most', 'especially', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'elder', 'Jake', 'One', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'when', 'Kira', 'approaches', 'Jake', 'suggest', 'leave', 'DS9', 'significant', 'moment', 'handled', 'touchingly', 'cheerlessly', 'being', 'gloomy', 'powerful', 'story', 'balanced', 'little', 'bit', 'scattered', 'humor', 'interesting', ""'growth"", 'development', 'DS9', 'regulars', 'Nog', 'featured', 'story', 'Federation', 'officer', 'who', 'old', 'friend', 'Jake', 'Dax', 'Bashir', 'are', 'also', 'featured', 'aged', 'pair', 'helping', 'recreate', 'accident', 'took', 'friend', 'former', 'captain', 'Benjamin', 'Sisko', 'life', 'names', 'Quark', 'Rom', 'Morn', 'are', 'also', 'name-dropped', 'amusing', 'updates', 'one', 'series', 'very', 'best', 'episodes', 'only', 'coldest', 'hearts', 'could', 'not', 'appreciate', 'warmth', 'sensitivity', 'upbeat', 'message.Some', 'additional', 'notes', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'arguably', 'Trek', 'most', 'versatile', 'actor', 'appeared', 'Worf', 'brother', 'Kurn', 'ST', 'TNG', ""'Sins"", 'Father', 'two-part', ""'Redemption"", 'still', 'later', 'ST', 'DS9', ""'Sons"", 'Mogh', 'was', 'cast', 'Alpha', 'Hirogen', 'Voyager', 'episode', ""'Prey"", 'Rachel', 'Robinson', 'who', 'Melanie', 'daughter', 'DS9', 'regular', 'Andrew', 'Robinson', 'Garak']","Star Trek - Deep Space Nine, Episode 76: The Visitor VHS"

The brief, frantic, interchanges between this father and son over the course of many years is heartwrenching...and valuable lessons can be learned from them.  Lessons about dealing with loss, regret, and the instinct to hang on to hope.Avery Brooks gives a stunning performance as Ben Sisko, and the actors that play Jake Sisko during various periods of his life do an excellent job as well.

The story takes place about 50 years after Benjamin Sisko disappears aboard the Defiant.  A young aspiring writer visits jake to question him why he quit writing so long ago.  He proceeds to tell her about the day his father disappeared.  The story is told in flashbacks as we learn that although Jake was haunted by Ben's death, he nonetheless married and became a famous writer.  But when Ben starts appearing to Jake for brief periods of time, Jake thinks his father may be alive in some kind of alternate dimension or universe.  He spends most of the next 50 years trying to figure out a way to retrieve his beloved father.  He sacrifices his marriage and career to this end.  But in order to get his father back, he may have to make the ultimate sacrifice.You will need a box of kleenex to watch this heartfelt episode.

The man is Jake Sisko and he was a highly touted writer until he suddenly quit writing. The woman wants to know why and Jake tells her.Decades before as a child, he witnessed his father Ben Sisko absorb an energy burst and disappear into a subspace anomaly. Over the years, Ben has reappeared on occasion, only to fade back into the anomaly after a few minutes. The loss devastated Jake, although at first he tried to get on with his life. However, that proves impossible, so in an attempt to get his father back, he sacrifices his writing career, marriage and all else in order to study the physics of the phenomenon. As the episode progresses, you reach the point when you want to tell Jake, ""Let it go and get on with your life."" Until the last few minutes of the episode, that would be the right attitude to take, until suddenly all of it comes together and you realize that Jake has done the right thing.This is without question one of the better episodes in the series, although it plods along and seems pointless until the ending.

Season two was, surprisingly, strong.  In season three, the producers and writers almost  dropped the ball -- it was a difficult year, to say the least.  With season  four, Deep Space Nine had found itself.With the fourth season premiere,  &quot;The Way of the Warrior&quot;, DS9 had re-introduced us to Worf and  dropped intriguing bombshell after bombshell into the faithful viewers'  collective laps.  DS9 fans were eagerly awaiting the season opener's  promise of Klingon politics and station intrigue.  Instead, without  warning, we get &quot;The Visitor&quot;, an episode that strayed from the  interstellar war and galactic conflict that the premiere had hinted at.  We  weren't expecting &quot;The Visitor&quot; and had no idea that this episode  would not only become the most popular DS9 episode ever but one of the most  popular episodes of any Trek series.&quot;The Visitor&quot; gives us a  glimpse at an alternate future where Jake Sisko had lost his father to a  mishap right after the events of &quot;The Way of the Warrior&quot;.  We  discover through an old Jake that his father wasn't dead but was  &quot;suspended out of time&quot;, never aging, never dying yet forever  alone.  Jake, obsessed with rescuing his father, sacrifices his marriage,  his career as a successful writer and, ultimately, his very life all to  save his father, Ben Sisko.  This episode is powerful and tragic.  We  understand Jake's sacrifice but at what cost?  In the end, we see a lonely  old man, who could never move on, attempt to alter the past so he can be  with his dad again.I challenge anyone to NOT cry at the ending.

Sisko sees the result of that every few years and begs Jake not to waste his life for his sake.  The emotional pull is heartbreaking.This is a very well done episode.

Like the best of Trek, this particular installment is more dependent on character development than special effects or other technical wizardry.The acting by all is first-rate.  Tony Todd (of ""Candyman"" fame and an earlier role as Worf's brother) turns in a fine performance as the elder Jake Sisko, enduring a lifelong quest to rescue his father from subspace limbo.  Cast member Cirroc Lofton gets one of his few chances to shine as the young Jake.  Guest star Rachel Robinson is quite good as a young woman that visits Jake in the winter of his years.  Last but not least, star Avery Brooks brings his usual dynamic strength to the role of Benjamin Sisko as he pops in and out at stages of his son's life.The respective scenes featuring exchanges between Brooks, Todd, and Lofton are endearing and memorable.Besides being well written and acted, the episode features one of the best scores of any Trek show.  It is no wonder that composer Dennis McCarthy's music is featured on a ""Best of Trek"" compilation album.  The music is a combination of subtlety, poetry, and foreboding as it represents the strong bond between father and son.""The Visitor"" is an example of true quality television and deserves a place in the TV Hall of Fame.",5,A Standout Episode for a Remarkable Series,1046563200,"03 2, 2003",2003,1314,"['Visitor', 'DS9', 'fourth', 'season', 'fan', 'critical', 'favorite', 'best', 'Trek', 'particular', 'installment', 'more', 'dependent', 'character', 'development', 'special', 'effects', 'other', 'technical', 'wizardry.The', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'Candyman', 'fame', 'earlier', 'role', 'Worf', 'brother', 'fine', 'performance', 'elder', 'Jake', 'Sisko', 'enduring', 'lifelong', 'quest', 'rescue', 'father', 'subspace', 'limbo', 'Cast', 'member', 'Cirroc', 'Lofton', 'one', 'few', 'chances', 'shine', 'young', 'Jake', 'Guest', 'star', 'Rachel', 'Robinson', 'quite', 'good', 'young', 'woman', 'visits', 'Jake', 'winter', 'years', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'star', 'Avery', 'Brooks', 'usual', 'dynamic', 'strength', 'role', 'Benjamin', 'Sisko', 'stages', 'son', 'life.The', 'respective', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'exchanges', 'Brooks', 'Todd', 'Lofton', 'are', 'endearing', 'memorable.Besides', 'being', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'episode', 'one', 'best', 'scores', 'Trek', 'show', 'wonder', 'composer', 'Dennis', 'McCarthy', 'music', 'featured', 'Best', 'Trek', 'compilation', 'album', 'music', 'combination', 'subtlety', 'poetry', 'foreboding', 'strong', 'bond', 'father', 'son', 'Visitor', 'example', 'true', 'quality', 'television', 'place', 'TV', 'Hall', 'Fame']","Star Trek - Deep Space Nine, Episode 76: The Visitor VHS"
