807224,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B0001I55Z6,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 12/12Rate: 912/12: Tex is the last film of the S.E. Hinton trilogy for me to see. I think the first two are disappointing although there are moments of excellence. But finally, Tex is the real winner of the three. It's just so good. While Matt Dillon is adorable and cute in The Outsiders, he is even more so in Tex. In fact, his performance ranks one of the best of his career. Pair him up with Meg Tilly. The results couldn't have been better. It's just a simple picture of growing up and facing challenges of life. It's Matt Dillon's personality and antics that shine through, so it is easy to like Tex a lot. It also helps a lot that Francis Ford Coppola didn't direct the picture, although I know he is very good at what he does, but he tried to be too artistic in Rumble Fish which killed it or went overboard with the all-star cast in The Outsiders which ended up being too corny to watch. In Tex, there is a great confluence of energy among the cast, and the chemistry in the affinity of all characters help Tex to be a wonderful picture it is. All in all, Tex is Matt Dillon's show.",5,Matt Dillon's Adorableness Takes Over.,1355529600,"12 15, 2012",2012,1099,"['Viewed', '12/12Rate', '912/12', 'Tex', 'last', 'film', 'S.E', 'Hinton', 'trilogy', 'see', 'think', 'first', 'two', 'are', 'disappointing', 'are', 'moments', 'excellence', 'finally', 'Tex', 'real', 'winner', 'three', 'just', 'so', 'good', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'adorable', 'cute', 'Outsiders', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Tex', 'fact', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'career', 'Pair', 'up', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'results', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'just', 'simple', 'picture', 'growing', 'up', 'facing', 'challenges', 'life', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'personality', 'antics', 'shine', 'easy', 'like', 'Tex', 'lot', 'also', 'lot', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'did', ""n't"", 'direct', 'picture', 'know', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'tried', 'be', 'too', 'artistic', 'Rumble', 'Fish', 'killed', 'went', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Outsiders', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'too', 'corny', 'watch', 'Tex', 'great', 'confluence', 'energy', 'cast', 'chemistry', 'affinity', 'characters', 'help', 'Tex', 'be', 'wonderful', 'picture', 'Tex', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'show']",N/A

I read the book when I was a teenager, and it was nice to refresh my memory of the story, which is portrayed well in this movie.
