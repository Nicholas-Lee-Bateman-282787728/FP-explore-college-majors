1024076,A29PPUG17KE809,B000J10GJ0,Abby,"[1, 1]","This product is somewhat good.  One cat is really into, gets up on TV table right in front of the tv and watches the animals flit from place to place.  My other cat did not seem to get it and paid no attention.  My dog was really excited by the squirrels the first they came on and stood nose to tv, but after about 10 minutes lost interest.  Guess she figured out it wasn't real.There are 5 types of animals: squirrels, bugs, birds, mice, and fish.  My kitty likes the fish and birds the best.  The bugs don't seem very interesting to anyone.  The mice scene is kind of gross for me to watch.On the plus side: A cool feature is that you can watch the whole tape or select only one animal and you can select the tape to loop or run just once.\Things I don't like: The filming is pretty plain.  Someone set a camera on the ground in the park and let it run.  It would be cool if it were a more natural setting, for example having birds in the tree instead of birds on cement.  But who knows, maybe cats wouldn't be as interested in that.  I also dislike that the soundtrack has nothing to do with the movie playing.  It is repetitive bird chirps.  There is no variation and it plays through all the animals, including the bugs and fish.  I haven't seen any other movies like this, so I don't know if these features are similar to all of them or not.  I'd like to try another one from a different company to see if it is better.",3,One cat likes it,1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,1426,"['product', 'somewhat', 'good', 'One', 'cat', 'really', 'up', 'TV', 'table', 'right', 'front', 'tv', 'animals', 'flit', 'place', 'place', 'other', 'cat', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'get', 'paid', 'attention', 'dog', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'squirrels', 'first', 'came', 'stood', 'nose', 'tv', '10', 'minutes', 'lost', 'interest', 'Guess', 'figured', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'are', '5', 'types', 'animals', 'squirrels', 'bugs', 'birds', 'mice', 'fish', 'kitty', 'fish', 'birds', 'best', 'bugs', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'interesting', 'anyone', 'mice', 'scene', 'kind', 'gross', 'watch.On', 'plus', 'side', 'cool', 'feature', 'can', 'watch', 'whole', 'tape', 'select', 'only', 'one', 'animal', 'can', 'select', 'tape', 'loop', 'run', 'just', 'once.\\Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'filming', 'pretty', 'plain', 'Someone', 'set', 'camera', 'ground', 'park', 'let', 'run', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'were', 'more', 'natural', 'setting', 'example', 'having', 'birds', 'tree', 'instead', 'birds', 'cement', 'who', 'maybe', 'cats', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'interested', 'also', 'dislike', 'soundtrack', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'playing', 'repetitive', 'bird', 'chirps', 'variation', 'animals', 'including', 'bugs', 'fish', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'features', 'are', 'similar', 'not', ""'d"", 'like', 'try', 'one', 'different', 'company', 'see', 'better']",The Purrfect Cat Entertainment Video

I was afraid she would leap at the screen and scratch my nice Plasma panel. She was definitely preparing to jump when I grabbed her. I held her for a while and she was pretty patient just watching while being held but she started to squirm and I got tired. When I turned it off kitty started looking below, and off to the sides trying to figure out where everything went! She even came back a few minutes later to see if there was any more action. She stared at the blank screen and meowed.I will set up an older TV I have if I can find a nice cheap DVD player.Why four and not five stars?1) Image quality pretty low -- good enough for the cat, though!2) Not wide-screen so I don't want to leave it playing for an extended time.

1024080,AHPV4F8IVSC39,B000J10GJ0,"Douglas B. Moran ""Computer+History/Politics""","[5, 6]","My cat responds to various sounds from my TV and computer, especially bird and animal calls. He charges up to the speaker and often spend some time trying to locate the source. With this video, absolutely nothing. He didn't even turn his head. And I am not surprised, because the sound track lacks any of the complexity of a bird or animal call. The sound is more like the ""chirp"" of an electronic alarm. It is played constantly, with no variation, and has no relationship to the video. You don't hear the rustling of leaves during the video of squirrels searching through those leaves. Nor is there a flutter of wings when birds are on-screen.My experience with cats is that sound is more important than vision for engaging them. Example: Most of my cat's favorite toys are lures on the end of a line. Dragging them across open carpet produces little or no response, but add a rustling sound by crossing a newspaper sheet or a plastic bag, and he charges from across the room and pounces.My cat has only infrequently shown interest in the pictures in standard TV programming, so he is not a reliable judge of what is here.

1024081,A3GGUBZMTQD1B9,B000J10GJ0,Esther Schindler,"[12, 12]","I expect that the primary market for this video (and its competitors) are people who are away at work all day and worry that the cat will get bored. Since ""bored"" can sometimes be synonymous with ""I'll shred the curtains because I can't think of anything better to do,"" that's a perfectly reasonable plan. It doesn't apply to me, so much, since I work at home full time. Nonetheless, I indulged in this video because I thought the cats would appreciate the ""treat"" of a video made just for them. And they certainly do!Plot? Ha. Characterization? Nope. The hour-long video is nothing but pictures of squirrels, birds (mostly pigeons), fish, rodents, and a few bugs romping around, with a soundtrack of birds, crickets, and other critters. It looks like footage that you could tape yourself with a video camera at a nearby park and pet store... except you wouldn't. Nor would you package it into a DVD that has the option to loop endlessly or to play just once through. Well, _I_ wouldn't, and I'm stupidly devoted to my bosses. Uh, I mean, to our cats.We've played the video twice, now, and both times the cats are fascinated. Their heads bounce from side to side, they stare at the screen, they look tempted to jump up and bat at the screen. (Fortunately, they have resisted this urge. So far.) One cat got very vocal and meowed in a determined manner; I have no idea what he was trying to tell us, but we enjoyed the conversation. During one hour-long episode where I left them alone with the video (and the volume turned way down, since I was on the phone), both cats wandered away... and then rushed right back. Whatever it means to them -- it sure does hold their interest. Which means that I have loads of fun watching them.The results you get presumably depend upon your own individual beasts, but ours -- one who's smart, the other who is as dumb as a box of rocks -- both liked the video.
