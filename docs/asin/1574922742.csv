191094,A1USQH50ILYFZG,1574922742,Jon Nelson,"[8, 8]","Caroline? is one of the best movies ever made for television. The acting is perfect by everyone. Stephanie Zimbalist gives such a great performance that the other actors are often overlooked, but Pamela Reed as Grace, who feels threatened by the arrival of this 'stranger' into her home, matches Zimbalist scene for scene. Shawn Phelan and Jenny Jacobs, as young siblings Winston and Heidi, are also incredible, giving performances that are beyond their years. There are wonderful metaphors and foreshadowing throughout, and many little details that may be missed with only one viewing (for example, check out the book that the adult Winston picks up and looks at early on- I'd watched this movie 4 times before I'd caught that wonderful detail). The movie, based on the book Father's Arcane Daughter, is very faithful and what few changes there are only make the story better.

191096,A3SKTPG5M6ND6,1574922742,"Katherine Laura Mayfield ""A Bookie""","[1, 4]","Stephanie Zimbalist plays the lovely Caroline Carmichael, who supposedly died fifteen years ago in a plane crash.  Now, she returns to her wealthy father and his young, new family, saying she never got on the plane, but simply walked away.Now, my first thought (especially considering there's a fortune at stake) is  to get a DNA test, but I am guessing they didn't have these back in 1990, or, if they did, they weren't very reliable, and I am only guessing that Caroline's resurrection from the dead is set in 1990--I am not sure.  I never got a grasp on what time period this was supposed to be set in.  I guessed the 1950's, but then that meant Caroline would have performed her vanishing act in the thirties, and judging by the scrapbook photos, that didn't seem to fit, so I guess the 1960's, but I still wasn't any more sure until the end, when you see these archaic desktop computers at the Caroline Carmichael school that look like the ones in the movie ""Wargames"", which was released in 1983.Anyway, I don't think the question is so much whether or not the pretty, auburn-haired woman is or is not Caroline, but why is she there, for the audience is led to believe that she is not a fortune hunter; she knows so much about Caroline, and yet, there are the little things that even the real Caroline could have possibly forgotten after fifteen years.CAUTION:  SPOILERS AHEAD!I believe that somewhere, very deep in his heart, Caroline's father had doubts that this was really his child he had presumed dead long ago, but he wanted so much to have his daughter back, he wanted to believe her so much that he ultimately did choose to believe her.  She was so good with his young children, one of them handicapped, that he had to believe that she believed they were her half-siblings and loved them as such.  He knew what Grace (his young wife) was doing to Hillary called Heidi, but he was allowing his love for Grace to hurt his young daughter by keeping her a baby, and he knew that.He needed Caroline as much as Heidi did.The beginning sequence with the dancers was totally unnecessary and the film would have benefited had the scene been cut and more scenes been added with Caroline connecting with her old friends so that we learn more about the old Caroline.  For though the real Caroline is no longer there (or is she?), her memory still lives in the hearts of the people who loved her, the people she left behind.The fact that I could never figure out where or when this was set was jarring, and the cinematography (the quality of the likes of ""Flowers in the Attic"") could have been a lot better (which is a pity because this is probably one of the best TV-movies ever made--still doesn't beat ""Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus""--if only this had had the same production values as ""The Story Lady"", also with Zimbalist), but it's still a very moving film that isn't as dark as it could have been, which would have been an improvement.However, it is above average for a made-for-TV movie and the acting by everyone is superb.",3,Father Arcane's Daughter,1207612800,"04 8, 2008",2008,3043,"['Stephanie', 'Zimbalist', 'lovely', 'Caroline', 'Carmichael', 'who', 'supposedly', 'died', 'fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'plane', 'crash', 'Now', 'wealthy', 'father', 'young', 'new', 'family', 'saying', 'never', 'got', 'plane', 'simply', 'walked', 'away.Now', 'first', 'thought', 'especially', 'considering', 'fortune', 'stake', 'get', 'DNA', 'test', 'am', 'guessing', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'back', '1990', 'did', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'reliable', 'am', 'only', 'guessing', 'Caroline', 'resurrection', 'dead', 'set', '1990', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'never', 'got', 'grasp', 'what', 'time', 'period', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'set', 'guessed', '1950', 'then', 'meant', 'Caroline', 'would', 'have', 'performed', 'vanishing', 'act', 'thirties', 'judging', 'scrapbook', 'photos', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'guess', '1960', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'sure', 'end', 'when', 'see', 'archaic', 'desktop', 'computers', 'Caroline', 'Carmichael', 'school', 'look', 'ones', 'movie', 'Wargames', 'was', 'released', '1983.Anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'question', 'so', 'much', 'not', 'pretty', 'auburn-haired', 'woman', 'not', 'Caroline', 'why', 'there', 'audience', 'led', 'believe', 'not', 'fortune', 'hunter', 'so', 'much', 'Caroline', 'yet', 'are', 'little', 'things', 'even', 'real', 'Caroline', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'forgotten', 'fifteen', 'years.CAUTION', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'believe', 'somewhere', 'very', 'deep', 'heart', 'Caroline', 'father', 'had', 'doubts', 'was', 'really', 'child', 'had', 'presumed', 'dead', 'long', 'ago', 'wanted', 'so', 'much', 'have', 'daughter', 'back', 'wanted', 'believe', 'so', 'much', 'ultimately', 'did', 'choose', 'believe', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'young', 'children', 'one', 'handicapped', 'had', 'believe', 'believed', 'were', 'half-siblings', 'loved', 'such', 'knew', 'what', 'Grace', 'young', 'wife', 'was', 'doing', 'Hillary', 'called', 'Heidi', 'was', 'allowing', 'love', 'Grace', 'hurt', 'young', 'daughter', 'keeping', 'baby', 'knew', 'that.He', 'needed', 'Caroline', 'as', 'much', 'Heidi', 'did.The', 'beginning', 'sequence', 'dancers', 'was', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'had', 'scene', 'been', 'cut', 'more', 'scenes', 'been', 'added', 'Caroline', 'connecting', 'old', 'friends', 'so', 'learn', 'more', 'old', 'Caroline', 'real', 'Caroline', 'no', 'longer', 'memory', 'still', 'hearts', 'people', 'who', 'loved', 'people', 'left', 'behind.The', 'fact', 'could', 'never', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'when', 'was', 'set', 'was', 'jarring', 'cinematography', 'quality', 'likes', 'Flowers', 'Attic', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'pity', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'TV-movies', 'ever', 'made', 'still', ""n't"", 'beat', 'Yes', 'Virginia', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'only', 'had', 'had', 'same', 'production', 'values', 'Story', 'Lady', 'also', 'Zimbalist', 'still', 'very', 'moving', 'film', ""n't"", 'as', 'dark', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'improvement.However', 'above', 'average', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'acting', 'everyone', 'superb']",N/A

191101,AR1T36GLLAFFX,1574922742,Scott FS,"[3, 4]","Stephanie Zimbalist plays the title role in this made-for-television movie.  Seemingly back from the dead, Caroline returns to her wealthy family telling them that she didn't get on the plane that crashed, killing all aboard, but used the disaster to make a clean break with her past life as a party girl.Her father has remarried while she was away some 14 years, and with his younger wife, fathered two more children, Heidi (Hillary) and Winston.  After some initial skepticism, the family welcomes Caroline back into the family.Caroline takes a good deal of interest in her two half-siblings, especially Heidi.  The young girl is 'slow', can't do much of anything for herself, and depends upon her mother Grace (Pamela Reed in a fine performance) and her brother Winston to look after her.Problem is, Grace is overprotective of her daughter, feeling guilty of not bringing a 'normal' child in the world.  This overprotection is stifling Heidi, who wants to be as normal as she can be.Caroline discovers that Heidi indeed is much more capable than her mother will admit.  She makes a pledge to help both Winston and Heidi grow and become all that would be possible.There is an interesting twist in the end that leaves a few threads hanging, but you'll have to see the movie to experience it for yourself!Worth seeking out.
