Interesting that the only place I've seen a blonde anchorman is in this film, especially since it points up one of my prejudices. The romance was about as lame as every other Hollywood romance since Gable and Colbert. Or perhaps since Romeo and Juliet. The basic concept of love and romance hasn't changed in about 20,000 years or more, so why does every author have to write about it? Maybe that's why I quit writing novels. At some point, Joe Q Reader's gonna wanna ask me what's behind Joe Stud Character's bedroom door, and I don't want to answer.Oh. The film. Sorry. I digressed. Albert Brooks is great. This movie gives me a reason to forgive William Hurt for ALTERED STATES. Jack Nicholson in a minor role, reminding us that yes, he knows (or knew) how to be subtle. (In WOLF he convinced me that he was a wimp. Imagine that.)At the end of this movie, the writers lost their way. The ""plot"" overrode everything and the Holly Hunter character went off about something that was far more important to her than it was to the audience. I suppose subtlety requires clarity of thought, so the ending had neither. The fact that you shouldn't enter a relationship with someone so adept at faking sincerity? How about the fact that you shouldn't end an otherwise observant movie with something so irrelevant? How about the question of whether all William Hurt movies end with a blinding flash of the obvious? But still, worth watching if you can find it for under a buck.",4,Broadcast News,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,1548,"['Watchable', 'cynical/realistic', 'view', 'topic', ""n't"", 'become', 'dated', 'Interesting', 'only', 'place', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'blonde', 'anchorman', 'film', 'especially', 'up', 'one', 'prejudices', 'romance', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'lame', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'romance', 'Gable', 'Colbert', 'perhaps', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'basic', 'concept', 'love', 'romance', ""n't"", 'changed', 'about', '20,000', 'years', 'more', 'so', 'why', 'author', 'have', 'write', 'Maybe', 'why', 'quit', 'writing', 'novels', 'point', 'Joe', 'Q', 'Reader', 'gon', 'wan', 'ask', 'what', 'behind', 'Joe', 'Stud', 'Character', 'bedroom', 'door', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'answer.Oh', 'film', 'Sorry', 'digressed', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'great', 'movie', 'reason', 'forgive', 'William', 'Hurt', 'ALTERED', 'STATES', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'minor', 'role', 'reminding', 'yes', 'knew', 'how', 'be', 'subtle', 'WOLF', 'convinced', 'was', 'wimp', 'Imagine', 'end', 'movie', 'writers', 'lost', 'way', 'plot', 'overrode', 'everything', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'character', 'went', 'something', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'was', 'audience', 'suppose', 'subtlety', 'clarity', 'thought', 'ending', 'had', 'fact', 'should', ""n't"", 'enter', 'relationship', 'someone', 'so', 'adept', 'faking', 'sincerity', 'How', 'fact', 'should', ""n't"", 'end', 'otherwise', 'observant', 'movie', 'something', 'so', 'irrelevant', 'How', 'question', 'William', 'Hurt', 'movies', 'end', 'blinding', 'flash', 'obvious', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'can', 'find', 'buck']",Broadcast News VHS

That is not a dig; it is a fine picture that almost defies categorization, being drama, romance and comedy all rolled into one.Holly Hunter is a total frenetic delight  as a high powered producer, and William Hurt was still in his young leading man phase as a budding news anchor, somewhat intellectually challenged.  Albert Brooks is also excellent, as a brilliant writer not in his element on screen due to flop sweats.  Many wonderful performances but will single out Joan Cusack as one of the assistants.  Why has this woman still not won an Oscar??  Out of many wonderful lines, one of my favorites comes when an old line executive is being laid off in a big retrenchment.

244548,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301066162,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 8]","Wildly witty and richly textured with raw human connection; James L. Brooks' comedic masterpiece `Broadcast News' is most definitely one of a kind.Well, talk about spilling it all in the opening sentence.  I don't even know how to follow that up.The film centers around three working bodies.  You have Tom Grunick, the pretty boy turned TV-Reporter who is embittered with himself for being too good.  He has a knack for something that he doesn't quite understand and it causes him to feel less than deserving; but it's apparently a mock-humility, as if he's searching for manipulated sympathies.  Then you have Aaron Altman, a very gifted and passionate reporter who lacks the presence and connection that Tom so effortlessly oozes.  He is battling his own insecurities as he is surely battling himself, trying to put up a front and become something he's not sure he wants to be.  Stuck in the middle of this testosterone ridden battle is a female producer, Jane Craig, who struggles with her feelings for these two men as she struggles with her feelings about herself and where she is headed; professionally and personally.`Broadcast News' is not a film merely about television, or the media, or the workplace but is a genuinely sincere look at relationships of the most important kind; the ones we have with ourselves.Each of these characters is not a whole person.  They are fractures shells of who they are meant to be, still struggling to put all their pieces together and figure out just who they truly are.  Tom is a mess, manipulating himself to believe that his gift is to manipulate the masses.  He believes that selling the news is more important than believing in it.  He has a talent for something he isn't quite sure he cares for, and thus his talent is wasted.  Jane is barely holding herself together as she attempts to separate her personal life from her professional life; a task that has taken its toll on both aspects.  She has scheduled times throughout the day to just cry, as if she spent the remaining twenty-three hours of her day forcing herself not to cry.  Aaron, to me, is the most interesting character because he seems to be the most confused.  His love for Jane feels almost forced, as if he feels that that is how he is supposed to feel, when I get the feeling that he was more in love with Tom than Jane, and his hatred for the man and everything he stood for was more a way for him to reject the feelings he convinced himself were not really there.  His personal life as well as his professional life is a mess and it's because he cannot for one second be honest with himself.But that's just my take.The three stars are all wonderful here (thus all garnering Oscar nominations), each one playing off the other with brilliant chemistry and naturalism.  William Hurt is perfectly wounded in his demeanor, as if he is trying to constantly defend his stance even when he doesn't have to; and Brooks (who is lead here, not supporting) is marvelously conflicted, etching the truth within Aaron's lies so wonderfully.  Holly Hunter, in my opinion, is a comic (and dramatic) gem here.  She really understands Jane, who is the moral centerpiece for the film.  She grasps her own demons and conflictions and dilemmas beautifully and creates one of her finest onscreen characters.The supporting cast, including the brilliant Joan Cusack (she really should be in every movie) and the always amazing Jack Nicholson, is also top notch, but this show belongs to the three leads.I definitely recommend this film, highly.  It's no wonder that all three leads received nominations at the Oscars, or that the film was up for four other awards that night, including Original Screenplay and Best Picture.  It is a shame that the film lost all seven though, especially since Holly Hunter's performance alone was the best in any category that year; bar none.",5,"The truth, and nothing but the truth...",1226620800,"11 14, 2008",2008,3870,"['Wildly', 'witty', 'richly', 'textured', 'raw', 'human', 'connection', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'comedic', 'masterpiece', 'Broadcast', 'News', 'most', 'definitely', 'one', 'kind.Well', 'talk', 'spilling', 'opening', 'sentence', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'follow', 'up.The', 'film', 'centers', 'three', 'working', 'bodies', 'have', 'Tom', 'Grunick', 'pretty', 'boy', 'turned', 'TV-Reporter', 'who', 'embittered', 'being', 'too', 'good', 'knack', 'something', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'feel', 'less', 'deserving', 'apparently', 'mock-humility', 'searching', 'manipulated', 'sympathies', 'Then', 'have', 'Aaron', 'Altman', 'very', 'gifted', 'passionate', 'reporter', 'who', 'presence', 'connection', 'Tom', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'battling', 'own', 'insecurities', 'surely', 'battling', 'trying', 'put', 'up', 'front', 'become', 'something', 'not', 'sure', 'be', 'Stuck', 'middle', 'testosterone', 'ridden', 'battle', 'female', 'producer', 'Jane', 'Craig', 'who', 'feelings', 'two', 'men', 'feelings', 'herself', 'where', 'headed', 'professionally', 'personally.', 'Broadcast', 'News', 'not', 'film', 'merely', 'television', 'media', 'workplace', 'genuinely', 'sincere', 'look', 'relationships', 'most', 'important', 'kind', 'ones', 'have', 'ourselves.Each', 'characters', 'not', 'whole', 'person', 'are', 'fractures', 'shells', 'who', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'still', 'struggling', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'who', 'truly', 'are', 'Tom', 'mess', 'manipulating', 'believe', 'gift', 'manipulate', 'masses', 'selling', 'news', 'more', 'important', 'believing', 'talent', 'something', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'thus', 'talent', 'wasted', 'Jane', 'barely', 'holding', 'together', 'separate', 'personal', 'life', 'professional', 'life', 'task', 'taken', 'toll', 'aspects', 'scheduled', 'times', 'day', 'just', 'cry', 'spent', 'remaining', 'twenty-three', 'hours', 'day', 'forcing', 'not', 'cry', 'Aaron', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'be', 'most', 'confused', 'love', 'Jane', 'feels', 'almost', 'forced', 'how', 'supposed', 'feel', 'when', 'get', 'feeling', 'was', 'more', 'love', 'Tom', 'Jane', 'hatred', 'man', 'everything', 'stood', 'was', 'more', 'way', 'reject', 'feelings', 'convinced', 'were', 'not', 'really', 'there', 'personal', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'professional', 'life', 'mess', 'can', 'not', 'one', 'second', 'be', 'honest', 'himself.But', 'just', 'take.The', 'three', 'stars', 'are', 'wonderful', 'here', 'thus', 'garnering', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'one', 'playing', 'other', 'brilliant', 'chemistry', 'naturalism', 'William', 'Hurt', 'perfectly', 'wounded', 'demeanor', 'trying', 'constantly', 'defend', 'stance', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'have', 'Brooks', 'who', 'lead', 'here', 'not', 'supporting', 'marvelously', 'conflicted', 'etching', 'truth', 'Aaron', 'lies', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'opinion', 'comic', 'dramatic', 'gem', 'here', 'really', 'Jane', 'who', 'moral', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'grasps', 'own', 'demons', 'conflictions', 'dilemmas', 'beautifully', 'one', 'finest', 'onscreen', 'characters.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'brilliant', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'movie', 'always', 'amazing', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'show', 'three', 'leads.I', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'film', 'highly', 'wonder', 'three', 'leads', 'received', 'nominations', 'Oscars', 'film', 'was', 'up', 'four', 'other', 'awards', 'night', 'including', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Picture', 'shame', 'film', 'lost', 'seven', 'especially', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'performance', 'alone', 'was', 'best', 'category', 'year', 'bar', 'none']",Broadcast News VHS

The movie is hers from start to finish, and makes the 'love triangle' subplot almost unnecessary. She's so smart in the film (a rarity for a lead female character) that you almost think if her only romantic choices are William Hurt's style-but-no-substance anchor or Albert Brooks's neurotic but intellectually arrogant reporter, she'd be better off with Robert Prosky. I guess some of my feelings mirror what San Diego Darren said down below, but it dosen't stop me from being a bit p'od at Albert Brooks. His was the character I identified with the most- the guy who's always seen as a 'brother' to the girl he really loves, and my favorite scene in the whole film is him getting the chance to kiss Hunter romantically. (It's preceded by a truly poignant moment of him confessing how much he loves her.) When he goes petulant later in the story, it's a bit hard to take.

244554,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,6301066162,C. Middleton,"[10, 11]","The media as purveyors of sensational 'news' in the spirit of good 'salesmanship' and entertainment as opposed to actually reporting unbiased, important events and issues to inform the public, that is journalism, as it was meant to be, is represented in this charming and witty film from the genius of James L. Brooks. (Terms of Endearment, As Good as it Gets) To be fair, some television news organizations attempt to report important events as they happen, avoiding sensationalism, the need to entertain, and maintain a modicum of integrity. But television news is more and more about the dazzling visual, the shocking three- minute sound bite between the all-important advertisements. This film cleverly addresses the question on what is 'real' news and what 'sells'. In the past we sort of had a clue or at least a choice as to what news source was credible, i.e., tabloid-ism and/or serious journalism. It all seems now to be blurred - sensationalism, gossip, opinion, selling and the so-called 'facts' of an event or issue has now appeared to all have melded together in the pursuit of market share and the almighty dollar.The character, Tom, (William Hurt) is a striving newsreader, and after reading sports at a local station, manages to land a job at one of the big networks. He is a little slow, can't write, and wouldn't know a real story if it dropped on his head, but he's good looking, personable, can at least read, and above all, has the innate ability to sell the birds off the trees. Here is the new force in television journalism - news anchor as television star. Then there is Aaron, (Albert Brooks) the reporter's reporter - brilliant, serious, idealistic and wholly uncharismatic in the popular sense. Although a writer with Pulitzer Prize ability, he attempts to read the news one Sunday night and almost drowns in his own flop sweat. Aaron is not a newsreader but a true writer and investigative journalist, a man who believes in the integrity of his profession. Then, of course, there's Jane, (Holly Hunter) a highly-strung, also brilliant, obsessive news producer, who shares this same idealistic integrity about journalism as her co-worker and best friend, Aaron. The film is about these three diverse and colourful individuals, who are drawn together for the same reasons, ambition and the news, but whose ideas about the news, their values concerning integrity, at least for one, are so different. This film is also about love, relationships and how the passionate desires of the heart do not necessarily match the logic of the head.At the time of it release, this film was acclaimed as the best romantic comedy to come out in years. It continues to be enormously entertaining and the issues it raises are relevant today. The film truly depicts the world of television news, how its standards have slowly dropped from reporting the events and issues to entertaining us with gossip, sensationalism and that all-important dazzling visual - news is now about entertainment and selling.  This is a film that should be pulled from the shelf occasionally and watched to remind us about integrity, maintaining a high standard in our values, and what great movie making is all about.

His film is not only chock full of truisms about network news but is also an incredibly entertaining and witty romantic comedy that is unafraid to sprinkle moments of compelling drama throughout.The first disc includes an audio commentary with writer-director-producer James L. Brooks and editor Richard Marks. Rather appropriately, Brooks starts off with talking about the genesis of the film and how the success ofTerms of Endearmentaffected it. He points out the bits in the film that came from his extensive research and touches upon the casting of the lead roles - for example, Holly Hunter was a last minute addition. Brooks is refreshingly candid and tells all kinds of fascinating filming anecdotes.Also included is a theatrical trailer.The second disc starts off with a 36-minute documentary entitled, James L. Brooks - A Singular Voice, with past collaborators singing his praises. It starts off with his trailblazing work in T.V. with 227, The Mary Tyler Moore Show and The Simpsons and how he helped change the medium. It also examines his transition into film and the success of Terms and how it led to Broadcast News.There is an alternate ending and 19 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary by Brooks. The ending is quite visceral and emotionally raw but is fascinating alternative to what is in the final film. For the deleted footage, Brooks talks about why it was cut and puts it into context. Interestingly, an entire subplot involving Tom and his news source was cut out.Also included is an interview with Susan Zirinsky, a veteran CBS News producer, one of the models for Jane in the film, and an advisor and associate producer. She talks about meeting Brooks for the first time as well as telling amusing and engaging anecdotes that really shed light on how truthful the film is about journalism. This is a fantastic extra and one of the highlights of this edition.There is a promotional featurette done at the time of the film's release that, at times, plays like an extended trailer only with perceptive interview soundbites from Brooks and the cast. Still, it is interesting to watch. Even better is additional interviews and on-set footage not included in the featurette that runs an impressive 18 minutes. It provides quite a bit of insight into Brooks' intentions and how the film got made.",5,Criterion Delivers All the Extras That are Fit to Print!,1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,2472,"['James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'films', 'Broadcast', 'News', 'most', 'successful', 'merging', 'T.V', 'sitcom', 'sensibilities', 'cinematic', 'aspirations', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'chock', 'full', 'truisms', 'network', 'news', 'also', 'incredibly', 'entertaining', 'witty', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'unafraid', 'sprinkle', 'moments', 'compelling', 'drama', 'throughout.The', 'first', 'disc', 'audio', 'commentary', 'writer-director-producer', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'editor', 'Richard', 'Marks', 'Rather', 'appropriately', 'Brooks', 'talking', 'genesis', 'film', 'how', 'success', 'ofTerms', 'Endearmentaffected', 'out', 'bits', 'film', 'came', 'extensive', 'research', 'casting', 'lead', 'example', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'was', 'last', 'minute', 'addition', 'Brooks', 'refreshingly', 'candid', 'kinds', 'fascinating', 'filming', 'anecdotes.Also', 'included', 'theatrical', 'trailer.The', 'second', 'disc', '36-minute', 'documentary', 'entitled', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'Singular', 'Voice', 'past', 'collaborators', 'singing', 'praises', 'trailblazing', 'work', 'T.V', '227', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'Simpsons', 'how', 'helped', 'change', 'medium', 'also', 'transition', 'film', 'success', 'Terms', 'how', 'led', 'Broadcast', 'News.There', 'alternate', 'ending', '19', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Brooks', 'ending', 'quite', 'visceral', 'emotionally', 'raw', 'fascinating', 'alternative', 'what', 'final', 'film', 'deleted', 'footage', 'Brooks', 'talks', 'why', 'was', 'cut', 'context', 'Interestingly', 'entire', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Tom', 'news', 'source', 'was', 'cut', 'out.Also', 'included', 'interview', 'Susan', 'Zirinsky', 'veteran', 'CBS', 'News', 'producer', 'one', 'models', 'Jane', 'film', 'advisor', 'associate', 'producer', 'meeting', 'Brooks', 'first', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'telling', 'amusing', 'engaging', 'anecdotes', 'really', 'shed', 'light', 'how', 'truthful', 'film', 'journalism', 'fantastic', 'extra', 'one', 'highlights', 'promotional', 'featurette', 'done', 'time', 'film', 'release', 'times', 'plays', 'extended', 'trailer', 'only', 'perceptive', 'interview', 'soundbites', 'Brooks', 'cast', 'Still', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Even', 'better', 'additional', 'interviews', 'on-set', 'footage', 'not', 'included', 'featurette', 'impressive', '18', 'minutes', 'quite', 'bit', 'insight', 'Brooks', 'intentions', 'how', 'film', 'got', 'made']",Broadcast News VHS

The Original Screenplay also received a nod, as did the Film Editing, Director(James L. Brooks), as well as the Best Picture nomination.  While it did not win any, much to my dismay, I do remember pulling for this film with all my heart.  &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; won 9 Oscars, so there wasn't much left over.  This is smart movie-making on all fronts.  Even the romance works here, which is often under considerable scrutiny from me.  Holly Hunter is pursued by two men, at polar opposites with regards to their personalities.

The matter of fact reply to the accusation is of the reasons why I love this movie so much. I initially saw it when it came out in 1987, and although the technology and wardrobe look dated, the film's core may be even more relevant today than it was when initially released and continues to play beautifully due to strong performances and a funny yet unusually incisive script.Right at the center of  the movie are 3 characters: Jane (Holly Hunter), a news writer-producer for the Washington bureau of a TV network. She is smart and is the ""go to"" person at the network as she works best under pressure and the character who responded to the remark about being the smartest person in a room. Her very best (and possibly only) friend is Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks), a bright, aggressive reporter, who along with Jane, have either true or self-created illusions great looks and intelligence can't coexist. Like Jane, Aaron is also very good at his job, but he wants to be on camera. During a speech that she is giving on the road, Jane meets Tom (William Hurt), an ex-sportscaster who has little education and doesn't know much about current events. But he has been hired for the Washington bureau because he looks good and has a natural relationship with the camera, and isn't that what matters?Although billed as a romantic comedy, which it is in part, the movie does a brilliant job of how many of us use work to measure who we are and at times use it an excuse to hide from life outside of that myopic perspective. In the course of the movie, the network goes through various upheavals based on the premise that news is losing (or by now has lost) its independence and has become entertainment with talking heads who make us feel good are replacing ""true"" journalists. Although the script is top notch, one of the reasons that movie resonates so well, is that the actors and the director manage to make even the most partisan statements not seem as didactic as they are on paper.None of the characters is perfect by any stretch of the imagination and the 3 leads are clearly not afraid to be dislikable. Their individual and collective effort works so well that you wind up being very interested/invested in them despite their flaws. This is without a doubt a career-defining performance by Holly Hunter who was robbed of the Oscar as it was given to Cher for her work in ""Moonstruck"" to ""make up"" for not rewarding her work in ""Mask."" William Hurt, a nuanced and complicated actor who was also nominated for the Oscar gives a change of pace performance as someone who's perfectly aware of his intellectual limitations but who sees no reason for them to interfere with his climb to the top. Albert Brooks is brilliant and comes very close to stealing the movie as he is hilarious and to me represents the moral conscience of the movie. He too was nominated for the Oscar and in my opinion was robbed as it was given to Sean Connery for what I think was a career award rather than his work in ""The Untouchables.""Sidebar: This movie received Oscar nominations in all major categories (Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay among others), the movie was not awarded a single Oscar as it was a year with great movies such as ""The Last Emperor"" and show-stopping performances, as was the case with Michael Douglas in ""Wall Street.""But back to the movie. Its writer/director, James L. Brooks, who hit a grand slam with ""Terms of Endearment,"" manages not to let any character run away with the movie as he tempers their self-righteousness (as is the case with Hunter and Brooks) and good luck (William Hurt) by making them more than bumper-sticker characters. There is a great line sequence in the movie in which one reporter asks fellow reporters ''Would you tell a source you loved them just to get information?'' The immediate response, ''Yes,'' is followed by laughter all around. In essence although James L. Brooks makes a strong case that the news BUSINESS has blurred many lines, even those of us who think fall on the ""right"" side of said line are not presented as heroes nor are those who apparently cross it vilified. The movie is packed with many one-liners that do more than amuse and makes keen observations without beating your head with them.This movie easily earns 5 stars and would almost be a perfect movie had it ended without a neatly tied-up last act that ALMOST, but not quite, manages to take away a movie that had only taken a single false step until then. That first false step, in my opinion, is what led to the unnecessary and forced last act. The big ""surprise"" and one character's reaction to it are much to do about nothing in the bigger picture.Notwithstanding this movie makes very strong statements (a la ""Network"" but much more subtle) about an industry and does so un such an entertaining and intelligent manner that I have to see this movie every few years, which is something that I rarely do. The outcome is almost irrelevant when compared to the joy of seeing these smart people interact with one another. Without a doubt, this is one of 1987's best movies. Enjoy and if you have not seen this movie, you'll be happily surprised by an unbilled performance by yet another amazing actor",5,Funny and incisive.

It'd make a fantastic double-feature with Tootsie, with which it shares a bunch of traits, like:- an incredible cast of supporting actors.- a bunch of seemingly throwaway lines and situations that make you belly laugh at the time and then creep up on you later.- some moderately serious (simple) questions, asked in an effortlessly funny way.- a particular sort of mid 80's look and feel. (I was surprised to feel a little nostalgic while watching this again.)Holly Hunter is amazing in this movie, just amazing and charismatic and lovable and genuine, and Albert Brooks brings a real(ly funnily neurotic) pathos to his corner of the love triangle. Bill Hurt never really comes clear for me in anything, but like Brooks, he's perfectly cast here. (It's creepy that Hurt gets top billing on Amazon and the DVD box. Among the three main characters, his easily pulls the least weight. Holly Hunter's the emotional center of everything in this movie, she's making the choices and carrying every scene, and her name should go first.)After you watch this one, tell me if you think Cher, in Moonstruck, deserved the Best Actress Oscar over Holly Hunter in Broadcast News (and Meryl Streep in Out of Africa).

Its achievement is that it is able to tell a compelling personal story (a love triangle of sorts) at the same time that it takes a snapshot of a pivotal moment in time in an industry critical to American democracy.  It's very different from Network, which mixes black humor and over-the-top satire with a couple of personal stories and a cheesy, poorly realized romance, but the two taken together can tell you a lot about where American news media went wrong.  I think James L. Brooks' script and direction are topnotch, and the three principals, Hunter, (Albert) Brooks, and Hurt are all good. Hunter is brilliant, and Brooks is as real and convincing as he has ever been in anything!So many movies tack on the romance as an artificial way of generating audience interest.  But this movie makes the romance part of the overall commentary, and the love triangle's eventual resolution is completely intertwined with the film's take on journalistic ethics--such an effective way of delivering a social statement in a personal way that is convincing and integral to the larger story.Pretty much everyone got nominated for this--Albert Brooks, Hunter, Hurt, and James Brooks.  And they got nothing, unfortunately, losing out to The Last Emperor, Moonstruck, and Wall Street, for goodness' sake.  Still,  a fine movie, well-crafted, intensely acted, and poignant.

She s being romantically pursued by her closest confident, Albert Brooks, a nerdy, cynical, but very capable news reporter, and the not-too-bright William Hurt, a handsome, sexy, up-and-coming anchorman, whose ethics she detests.Which one will win her heart?Also in the cast are Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack and, in an amusing cameo role, Jack Nicholson.The Criterion Collection has released a superb new 2-disc edition of BROADCAST NEWS, featuring many exciting extras, including an interesting alternate ending and several intriguing deleted scenes that feature a colorful character that was cut from the final movie.  Other extras include audio commentary by director Brooks and film editor Richard Marks, a new documentary about Brooks' career, a featurette about the CBS News producer who served as a model for Hunter's character, on-the-set footage and interviews with the stars, plus an accompanying booklet about the picture.Despite its topical content, BROADCAST NEWS holds up very well.

244577,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,6301066162,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","I think the last time I watched this classic was on laserdisc, so it's been a while.  The film, set in a major network newsroom in Washington, D. C., and the story focuses on a trio of hardworking, ambitious journalists.  Jane (Holly Hunter) is a news producer.  Her best friend, Aaron (Albert Brooks) is a mostly field reporter who is hungry for a week-end anchor job.  New to the station is a former sports reporter named Tom Grunick (William Hurt).  He is being groomed to be an anchor.Each of the trio have their strengths and weaknesses as the story will eventually reveal.  What is key is that Tom is admittedly a bit short in the smarts department.  But he's not stupid and he looks good.  So good that Jane is attracted to him but at the same time is dismissive because of his news shallowness.  Jane has no romantic relationship as a result of her devotion to her job.  So devoted that she is also oblivious to Aaron's constant swooning.  So there is our little triangle.While all of that is funny, entertaining and ultimately heartbreaking, the real meat on the bones here is the prescient vision of writer/director James L. Brooks.  The television news business is transitioning away from hard news and moving more into celebrity based news and human interest stories.  In a presentation to her peers, Jane shows how several TV stations eschewed a breaking story on the other side of the globe, for a story about a girl's domino championship.  Everybody was bored and walked out.There are a lot of small things in this film that make it work so well.  Early on we get a glimpse of Jane making a last minute change to a feature to be reported.  In one nice scene  Jane actually sees what Tom can do well.  Read the news with changes being fed into his earpiece at the same time...and look good doing it.  This is a wonderful film with numerous awards including 7 Oscar nominations (Brooks, the 3 lead actors, picture, editing) that holds up well today.  It has gone on to influence similarly themed screenings ranging from HBO's ""Newsroom"" to Will Ferrell's ""Anchorman 2"".See it on Blu ray which is now available from Criterion.  The transfer is in 1080p with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Here is a piece lifted from Criterion's booklet:""Supervised and approved by director James L. Brooks and editor Richard Marks, this new high-definition digital transfer was created on a DFT SCANITY Film Scanner in 4k resolution from the original 35mm camera negative, and color corrected on a Baselight Eight in 2K resolution.

The opening 20th Century Fox logo page notwithstanding, fine grain has been painstakingly added back in to the picture.  This really looks like a film, not a digital reproduction.

244578,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,6301066162,Mr. Cairene,"[8, 9]","Broadcast News is one of those films that makes you feel like you've had a perfect meal. Its makes you feel content and grateful that a film could be so perfect. On the surface this is called a romantic-comedy, a genre  muddied buy wittless trash like Picture Perfect but this film is as(for  lack of a better word) deep as they come. Yes it is at times funny, but all  three leads are very and even painfully real. Holly Hunter periodically  disconnecting the phone, crying for a while and then giong back to work,  sounds overtly cutsy, but as performed it somehow fits. Albert Brooks (in  his best role) is a knock-out, he plays a reporter who is  gifted/nuerotic/disposable and very much in love with Holly Hunter. He has  this unforgettable speech about Tom(William Hurt) being the devil where he  is &quot;semi-serious&quot; that manages to be over the top hilarious and  unbearably sad. William Hurt, in his string of great 80s performance plays  Tom, a man of low I.Q. but a deep understanding of life, he is the subject  of Holly Hunters loathing and affection. These three set the stage for a  perfect morality play, a realistic expose of life in network news, its  politics and the cost career driven people have to pay. As a critique of  network news, I liked this film better than Sidney Lumet's NETWORK becuase  that film wet completely over the top in its final quarter, Broadcast  News's approach on the other hand is through real characters that we can  symphasise with. This is director James L.Brooks's best film. I can only  count four he made, most recently As Good As It Gets.That film is just a  lighthearted unrealistic if highly enjoyable comedy, and it does not nearly  come close to the depth of this film.

But, there is more to this movie than just three co-workers who fight, play, and cry together.  This interesting look at TV news probably best sums up the production of news teams on major networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) as well as CNN, FOX, and MS-NBC.  The overall big picture of this movie is the sensationalizing of news through a handsome anchor (William Hurt's Tom Grunick), informative but dry correspondent (Albert Brooks' Aaron Altmann), and a clever behind-the-scenes producer (Holly Hunter's Jane Craig).  To avoid revealing anymore plot, this lesser-known hit from James L. Brooks probably was too smart for the Oscars.  Now days, this movie probably would be given the attention of more controversial films like ""Good Night, Good Luck"" and such.  Overall, this was probably in my opinion the first serious and also funny look into what journalism really is today.  The DVD quality is decent and expect a reasonable transfer by FOX.  Besides the film, there are the original trailers which are a little grainy.  Unfortunately, there are no extras on this DVD but the quality of the film makes it up.

244581,A39IY0JU5JI69G,6301066162,"Promise ""promise""","[2, 2]","I saw Broadcast News when it first came out and liked it a lot.  I just watched it again the other night and I think I like it even better now---the mark of a really good film.On one level it's about the depressing tendency of big broadcasting companies to  appoint good looking people over intelligent ones to anchor positions.  On another level it's about three young single people who are thrown together and the romances that happen or almost happen.It's the genius of the script that makes what could have been a formulaic story into something much richer and more interesting.We're shown shots of the three principles as children, then we see the story of their meeting in a tv newsroom in Washington, DC. then we're given a short epilogue, several years later.  This tells us that this is essentially a human drama, yes, set against the throes of the harsh realities of tv news-biz, but mostly it's about these three very different and very interesting characters.The cast is first rate.  William Hurt, as Tom, the ostensibly dumb-but-good-looking hick from Kansas who arrives in the big time, meets up with the ""smartest girl in the room"" and the loneliest, played by Holly Hunter, and her best buddy, the also smart but socially challenged guy played by Albert Brooks. I should have inserted ""brilliantly"" before each ""played"" because they were, and each was nominated for an Oscar.It turns out that Tom is dumb-like-a-fox as he manages to get positions that the poor Brooks character would die for.  And in the process he gets Hunter, the girl Brooks has been pining for.I won't give away the rest of the story...just want to say that things aren't always what they seem and this is the genius of this story.  Hunter and Brooks pride themselves on their superior ethics but each commits a major crime in that department---Hunter sends her female competition for Hurt off to Alaska so she can have him to herself.  And Brooks, after being rejected by Hunter for Hurt, discloses a piece of information, gratuitously, that turns her against him.  Self-righteousness seems to win but does it?  You watch and decide.  And enjoy the trip.The whole cast is good. Jack Nicholson is hilarious in a cameo role.  I particularly want to single out William Hurt, though.  He is such a brilliant, intelligent actor that he manages to bring out an unexpected complexity in the character of Tom, who, in lesser hands might have degenerated into a stereotype.",5,Still Brilliant after all these years,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,2452,"['saw', 'Broadcast', 'News', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'liked', 'lot', 'just', 'watched', 'again', 'other', 'night', 'think', 'like', 'even', 'better', 'now', '-the', 'mark', 'really', 'good', 'film.On', 'one', 'level', 'depressing', 'tendency', 'big', 'broadcasting', 'companies', 'appoint', 'good', 'looking', 'people', 'intelligent', 'ones', 'anchor', 'positions', 'level', 'three', 'young', 'single', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'thrown', 'together', 'romances', 'happen', 'almost', 'happen.It', 'genius', 'script', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'formulaic', 'story', 'something', 'much', 'richer', 'more', 'interesting.We', ""'re"", 'shown', 'shots', 'three', 'principles', 'children', 'then', 'see', 'story', 'meeting', 'tv', 'newsroom', 'Washington', 'DC', 'then', ""'re"", 'given', 'short', 'epilogue', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'essentially', 'human', 'drama', 'yes', 'set', 'throes', 'harsh', 'realities', 'tv', 'news-biz', 'mostly', 'three', 'very', 'different', 'very', 'interesting', 'characters.The', 'cast', 'first', 'rate', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Tom', 'ostensibly', 'dumb-but-good-looking', 'hick', 'Kansas', 'who', 'big', 'time', 'up', 'smartest', 'girl', 'room', 'loneliest', 'played', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'best', 'buddy', 'also', 'smart', 'socially', 'challenged', 'guy', 'played', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'should', 'have', 'inserted', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'were', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar.It', 'out', 'Tom', 'dumb-like-a-fox', 'get', 'positions', 'poor', 'Brooks', 'character', 'would', 'die', 'process', 'Hunter', 'girl', 'Brooks', 'been', 'pining', 'for.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'rest', 'story', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'what', 'seem', 'genius', 'story', 'Hunter', 'Brooks', 'pride', 'superior', 'ethics', 'major', 'crime', 'department', '-Hunter', 'female', 'competition', 'Hurt', 'Alaska', 'can', 'have', 'herself', 'Brooks', 'being', 'rejected', 'Hunter', 'Hurt', 'piece', 'information', 'gratuitously', 'Self-righteousness', 'win', 'watch', 'decide', 'enjoy', 'trip.The', 'whole', 'cast', 'good', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'hilarious', 'cameo', 'role', 'particularly', 'want', 'single', 'out', 'William', 'Hurt', 'though', 'such', 'brilliant', 'intelligent', 'actor', 'bring', 'out', 'unexpected', 'complexity', 'character', 'Tom', 'who', 'lesser', 'hands', 'might', 'have', 'degenerated', 'stereotype']",Broadcast News VHS

It is about three REAL people in a somewhat messy love triangle, but it is so much better than any other movie in this genre because it doesn't stoop to stupid resolutions. The three  main characters(Holly Hunter, William Hurt, Albert Brooks) are great at  what they do, which is broadcast news, but they are terrible at matters of  the heart. They always say the wrong thing at the wrong time, and because  of that, we identify with them. When have any of us ever been absolutely  perfect in the area of romance?

244583,ATJRTEOGW5OZN,6301066162,Rons Reviews,"[5, 5]","Few writers are able to capture the human condition as well as James L. Brooks who honed his skills by writing for some of the most memorable television shows of the sixties and seventies including; The Andy Griffith Show, My Three sons, That Girl, Room 222, Mary Tyler Moore, Taxi, and many others.  In the eighties Brooks would break onto the big screen with Terms of Endearment in 1983.  He would follow that four years later with arguably his greatest accomplishment as he would write, produce, and direct, Broadcast News.Broadcast News displays the ability of Brooks to write humorous dialog without writing jokes, and we see that clearly as we are invited into the world of television news and the lives of passive aggressive reporter Tom Grunick (William Hurt), Type A producer Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), and the news teams everyman Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks).  Brooks has managed to create characters with so much depth that it makes them incredibly relatable to the audience and leaves us longing for the next word from their mouths.  Broadcast News truly leaves the audience wanting more.Though a little early for a 25th anniversary release; the Criterion Collection brought Broadcast News to the shelves with a two disc DVD Special Edition on January 25th 2011.  This new release includes some fine bonus material with a restored high definition transfer of the film.  The film looks and sounds great and the bonus material makes for a well rounded presentation that allows insight into all aspects of the film.The documentary ""James L. Brooks - A Singular Voice"" is a well made piece on the career of Brooks with interesting interviews with those involved in many of Brooks' efforts.  Most noticeably missing from the documentary is Brooks himself, and this does leave the documentary a bit incomplete.  Luckily we do get some info from Brooks in some of the other bonus material.In most cases, when films get the ""Special Edition"" treatment, deleted scenes and alternate endings add little value as it is quite obvious why the scenes were deleted and alternate endings were not used.  That is not the case here.  Over the years, the ending for Broadcast News has been a topic of much discussion amongst critics and fans alike.  Finally some insight into Brooks' thought process is available as he sets up the alternate ending for us.  The deleted scenes also go above and beyond as we are introduced to a new character and an entire storyline that changes the Tom Grunick character.  The storyline is interesting, but the impact on the youthful innocence of Grunick is tarnished, and subsequently; it had to go.The interview with CBS news producer Susan Zirinsky who served as an inspiration for the Jane Craig character, as well as an associate producer on the film, is a great piece that covers far more than just the impact that Ms. Zirinsky had on the production.The featurette which is touted as containing on-set footage and interviews with Brooks, Hunter, and Actor Albert Brooks, is not only hard to find due to the format of the menu, but it also a bit oversold as it plays out more like an extended trailer for the film.The packaging for this release leave a lot to be desired as it fails to capture the fun energy of the film, and actually looks faded and worn out.Recommendation:  This is a great film with a foundation built on strong characters and brilliant dialog.  The bonus material makes this a must have for even those who already own the film.",5,Broadcast News,1297209600,"02 9, 2011",2011,3479,"['Few', 'writers', 'are', 'able', 'capture', 'human', 'condition', 'as', 'well', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'who', 'honed', 'skills', 'writing', 'most', 'memorable', 'television', 'shows', 'sixties', 'seventies', 'including', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'My', 'Three', 'sons', 'Girl', 'Room', '222', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Taxi', 'many', 'others', 'eighties', 'Brooks', 'would', 'break', 'big', 'screen', 'Terms', 'Endearment', '1983', 'would', 'follow', 'four', 'years', 'later', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'accomplishment', 'would', 'write', 'produce', 'direct', 'Broadcast', 'News.Broadcast', 'News', 'ability', 'Brooks', 'write', 'humorous', 'dialog', 'writing', 'jokes', 'see', 'clearly', 'are', 'invited', 'world', 'television', 'news', 'lives', 'passive', 'aggressive', 'reporter', 'Tom', 'Grunick', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Type', 'A', 'producer', 'Jane', 'Craig', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'news', 'teams', 'everyman', 'Aaron', 'Altman', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'Brooks', 'managed', 'create', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'incredibly', 'relatable', 'audience', 'longing', 'next', 'word', 'mouths', 'Broadcast', 'News', 'truly', 'audience', 'wanting', 'little', 'early', '25th', 'anniversary', 'release', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'brought', 'Broadcast', 'News', 'shelves', 'two', 'disc', 'DVD', 'Special', 'Edition', 'January', '25th', '2011', 'new', 'release', 'fine', 'bonus', 'material', 'restored', 'high', 'definition', 'transfer', 'film', 'film', 'looks', 'great', 'bonus', 'material', 'well', 'rounded', 'presentation', 'insight', 'aspects', 'film.The', 'documentary', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'Singular', 'Voice', 'well', 'made', 'piece', 'career', 'Brooks', 'interesting', 'interviews', 'involved', 'many', 'Brooks', 'efforts', 'Most', 'noticeably', 'missing', 'documentary', 'Brooks', 'leave', 'documentary', 'bit', 'incomplete', 'Luckily', 'do', 'get', 'info', 'Brooks', 'other', 'bonus', 'most', 'cases', 'when', 'films', 'get', 'Special', 'Edition', 'treatment', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'endings', 'add', 'little', 'value', 'quite', 'obvious', 'why', 'scenes', 'were', 'deleted', 'alternate', 'endings', 'were', 'not', 'used', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'years', 'ending', 'Broadcast', 'News', 'been', 'topic', 'much', 'discussion', 'critics', 'fans', 'alike', 'Finally', 'insight', 'Brooks', 'thought', 'process', 'available', 'up', 'alternate', 'ending', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'also', 'go', 'above', 'are', 'introduced', 'new', 'character', 'entire', 'storyline', 'Tom', 'Grunick', 'character', 'storyline', 'interesting', 'impact', 'youthful', 'innocence', 'Grunick', 'tarnished', 'subsequently', 'had', 'go.The', 'interview', 'CBS', 'news', 'producer', 'Susan', 'Zirinsky', 'who', 'served', 'inspiration', 'Jane', 'Craig', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'associate', 'producer', 'film', 'great', 'piece', 'far', 'more', 'just', 'impact', 'Ms.', 'Zirinsky', 'had', 'production.The', 'featurette', 'touted', 'containing', 'on-set', 'footage', 'interviews', 'Brooks', 'Hunter', 'Actor', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'not', 'only', 'hard', 'find', 'due', 'format', 'menu', 'also', 'bit', 'oversold', 'out', 'more', 'extended', 'trailer', 'film.The', 'packaging', 'release', 'leave', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'capture', 'fun', 'energy', 'film', 'actually', 'faded', 'worn', 'out.Recommendation', 'great', 'film', 'foundation', 'built', 'strong', 'characters', 'brilliant', 'dialog', 'bonus', 'material', 'must', 'have', 'even', 'who', 'already', 'own', 'film']",Broadcast News VHS
244584,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,6301066162,Shashank Tripathi,"[6, 8]","Apart from sporting the most powerful newsroom dynamics since His Girl Friday or Up Close & Personal, this film portrays the delicate balance between intelligence and amorous attraction, and in doing so, manages to slink in a gentle poke at the news industry at the same time.The theme is smart -- an examination of the atavistic obsession with physical appearance and its ultimate triumph over intellect as a valued human attribute. But it doesn't wear geek glasses. Instead, it comes wrapped in an effortless, witty script. The dialogue is crisp and moments abound. The humor is grown-up and in liberal dollops. The performances by the three leads are very credible and make you feel for each of their characters. William Hurt a smooth talking player, Brooks the geek who knows it all but gets all loopy in front of the camera, Hunter their common denominator. Jack Nicholson and John Cusack turn in surprise cameos that don't hurt the overall experience at all.One could speculate that this movie didn't walk away with any Academy statuettes despite being nominated in several categories because the very interesting build-up did not culminate into a neat little ending that would satisfy everyone. A small Hollywood-inclined part of me feels that it could have ended a little differently too. This discontent stems perhaps from a hopeful optimism to see things work out between people whom we have seen trying to be with each other, but it does reflect the starkness of romance in the real world.These truths may not be everyone's cup of bitter machiato, but overall, the bustle of the warm bumbling interactions between regular people trying to make it in a cut-throat industry and finding some meaning in their lives in the process, is definitely worth a ride. I get glued to this film even after having seen this several times, and that is saying something.",4,A SHARP WITTY COMEDY THAT REFLECTS THE REALITY OF ROMANCE A LITTLE TOO HONESTLY,1049932800,"04 10, 2003",2003,1864,"['Apart', 'sporting', 'most', 'powerful', 'newsroom', 'dynamics', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'Up', 'Close', 'Personal', 'film', 'delicate', 'balance', 'intelligence', 'amorous', 'attraction', 'doing', 'so', 'slink', 'gentle', 'poke', 'news', 'industry', 'same', 'time.The', 'theme', 'smart', 'examination', 'atavistic', 'obsession', 'physical', 'appearance', 'ultimate', 'triumph', 'over', 'intellect', 'valued', 'human', 'attribute', ""n't"", 'wear', 'geek', 'glasses', 'Instead', 'wrapped', 'effortless', 'witty', 'script', 'dialogue', 'crisp', 'moments', 'abound', 'humor', 'grown-up', 'liberal', 'dollops', 'performances', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'very', 'credible', 'make', 'feel', 'characters', 'William', 'Hurt', 'smooth', 'talking', 'player', 'Brooks', 'geek', 'who', 'loopy', 'front', 'camera', 'Hunter', 'common', 'denominator', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'John', 'Cusack', 'turn', 'surprise', 'cameos', 'do', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'overall', 'experience', 'all.One', 'could', 'speculate', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'walk', 'away', 'Academy', 'being', 'nominated', 'several', 'categories', 'very', 'interesting', 'build-up', 'did', 'not', 'culminate', 'neat', 'little', 'ending', 'would', 'satisfy', 'everyone', 'small', 'Hollywood-inclined', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'little', 'differently', 'too', 'discontent', 'perhaps', 'hopeful', 'optimism', 'see', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'people', 'whom', 'have', 'seen', 'trying', 'be', 'other', 'reflect', 'starkness', 'romance', 'real', 'world.These', 'truths', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'bitter', 'machiato', 'overall', 'bustle', 'warm', 'bumbling', 'interactions', 'regular', 'people', 'trying', 'make', 'cut-throat', 'industry', 'finding', 'meaning', 'lives', 'process', 'definitely', 'worth', 'ride', 'get', 'glued', 'film', 'even', 'having', 'seen', 'several', 'times', 'saying', 'something']",Broadcast News VHS
244585,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,6301066162,Steven Aldersley,"[0, 0]","If you watch television at all, you have almost certainly seen something that James L. Brooks was involved in. He was a writer on Taxi, Lou Grant, Rhoda and the Mary Tyler Moore show and continues to contribute to The Simpsons. His first film, Terms of Endearment, took home five Oscars, with Brooks being credited for three of them.Broadcast News is a blend of comedy, drama and romance. When I first watched it over 20 years ago, I was disappointed. I didn't think it was interesting, funny or moving in any way. It's strange how our tastes can change over the years. I think I appreciate the film now because I know more about life and can relate to some of the events.Two brief scenes at the start of the film introduce us to the characters of Tom and Jane. We learn that Tom doesn't mind being beaten up at school because he knows he will have a better career than any of the bullies he has to deal with. Jane shows us a glimpse of her character as she chastises her father for his imprecise use of words.The story continues with the adult Jane (Hunter) giving a speech about news coverage. She's dismayed at how the networks dumb-down information to appease the audience. When she demonstrates her point with a mindless news article, her audience is more responsive than at any other point in her speech.The only person who admires her presentation is Tom (Hurt) and she asks him to dinner. He presents the news, but reveals that he knows very little about the stories he talks about. Despite that, his employers love what he does and pay him large sums of money.Jane is obsessed with her job as a producer and can't respect people who are bad at their job. Any chance of romance is ended when she speaks her mind to Tom. She repels men. Hunter got the part which was intended for Debra Winger, but it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. Her accent and the determination with which her character pursues her career reminds me of Jodie Foster's performance in The Silence of the Lambs.How often do people succeed on charm or because the right look? The film explores that theme throughout as we see Tom take every opportunity that presents itself. In contrast, we see a gifted reporter, Aaron (Brooks), receive no recognition from anyone with the exception of Jane. The two have a deep friendship and confide in each other regularly.James L. Brooks has a background in news and portrays the high-paced environment to good effect. There's an hilarious scene early in the film in which Jane edits a story just a few seconds before it is due to air, and her assistant (Joan Cusack) has to dodge all manner of unlikely obstacles to deliver the tape on time. Although it's a funny scene, it shows how much pressure is involved in the news business.Another exceptional scene shows Tom anchoring the news for the first time. Jane knows that he is likely to stumble if he has to think up questions for himself, so she takes care of all the content. Aaron, who is at home getting drunk after being overlooked again, calls in with information which Jane feeds to Tom while he is on the air. The result is a professional broadcast in which Tom is made to look highly competent.There are a lot of similar scenes which give us a real understanding of how the news business might work. We feel part of that world. However, the film shines because of the acting and the dark comedy. Brooks is the source of much of the humor, but Hurt and Hunter play their parts well. Jack Nicholson has a small role and pulls it off perfectly as you would expect.There is a love triangle of sorts. Tom is successful, but superficial, and he is interested in Jane. Part of his interest appears to be driven by what she might do for his career. Aaron can see Tom's shortcomings and thinks that he's a more suitable partner for Jane. He clearly loves her as well as being her best friend. Jane is torn between Tom's looks and success, and Aaron's friendship and competence. I'll let you find out the resolution for yourself.Criterion's Blu-ray presentation is excellent and the film looks better than it ever has. The special features include recent interviews with James L. Brooks and the cast. One of the most interesting features is an alternate ending with comments from Brooks.Broadcast News is unusual in that it manages to make a technical job appear exciting. I wanted to see what would happen to the three main characters. It's funny throughout in an intelligent way and the romantic element will please some viewers. I can't believe that I failed to see its brilliance when I first watched it over 20 years ago.",5,"A good blend of comedy, drama and romance",1333929600,"04 9, 2012",2012,4600,"['watch', 'television', 'have', 'almost', 'certainly', 'seen', 'something', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'was', 'involved', 'was', 'writer', 'Taxi', 'Lou', 'Grant', 'Rhoda', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'show', 'contribute', 'Simpsons', 'first', 'film', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'took', 'home', 'five', 'Oscars', 'Brooks', 'being', 'credited', 'three', 'them.Broadcast', 'News', 'blend', 'comedy', 'drama', 'romance', 'When', 'first', 'watched', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'interesting', 'funny', 'moving', 'way', 'strange', 'how', 'tastes', 'can', 'change', 'years', 'think', 'appreciate', 'film', 'now', 'know', 'more', 'life', 'can', 'relate', 'events.Two', 'brief', 'scenes', 'start', 'film', 'introduce', 'characters', 'Tom', 'Jane', 'learn', 'Tom', ""n't"", 'mind', 'being', 'beaten', 'up', 'school', 'will', 'have', 'better', 'career', 'bullies', 'deal', 'Jane', 'glimpse', 'character', 'father', 'imprecise', 'use', 'words.The', 'story', 'adult', 'Jane', 'Hunter', 'giving', 'speech', 'news', 'coverage', 'dismayed', 'how', 'networks', 'dumb-down', 'information', 'appease', 'audience', 'When', 'point', 'mindless', 'news', 'article', 'audience', 'more', 'responsive', 'other', 'point', 'speech.The', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'presentation', 'Tom', 'Hurt', 'dinner', 'news', 'reveals', 'very', 'little', 'stories', 'about', 'employers', 'love', 'what', 'pay', 'large', 'sums', 'money.Jane', 'obsessed', 'job', 'producer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'respect', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'bad', 'job', 'chance', 'romance', 'ended', 'when', 'mind', 'Tom', 'men', 'Hunter', 'got', 'part', 'was', 'intended', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'role', 'accent', 'determination', 'character', 'career', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'performance', 'Silence', 'Lambs.How', 'often', 'do', 'people', 'succeed', 'charm', 'right', 'look', 'film', 'theme', 'see', 'Tom', 'take', 'opportunity', 'contrast', 'see', 'gifted', 'reporter', 'Aaron', 'Brooks', 'receive', 'recognition', 'anyone', 'exception', 'Jane', 'two', 'have', 'deep', 'friendship', 'confide', 'other', 'regularly.James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'background', 'news', 'high-paced', 'environment', 'good', 'effect', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'early', 'film', 'Jane', 'story', 'just', 'few', 'seconds', 'due', 'air', 'assistant', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'dodge', 'manner', 'unlikely', 'obstacles', 'deliver', 'tape', 'time', 'funny', 'scene', 'how', 'much', 'pressure', 'involved', 'news', 'exceptional', 'scene', 'shows', 'Tom', 'anchoring', 'news', 'first', 'time', 'Jane', 'likely', 'stumble', 'think', 'up', 'questions', 'care', 'content', 'Aaron', 'who', 'home', 'getting', 'drunk', 'being', 'overlooked', 'again', 'information', 'Jane', 'feeds', 'Tom', 'air', 'result', 'professional', 'broadcast', 'Tom', 'made', 'look', 'highly', 'are', 'lot', 'similar', 'scenes', 'give', 'real', 'understanding', 'how', 'news', 'business', 'might', 'work', 'feel', 'part', 'world', 'However', 'film', 'shines', 'acting', 'dark', 'comedy', 'Brooks', 'source', 'much', 'humor', 'Hurt', 'Hunter', 'play', 'parts', 'well', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'small', 'role', 'off', 'perfectly', 'would', 'expect.There', 'love', 'triangle', 'sorts', 'Tom', 'successful', 'superficial', 'interested', 'Jane', 'Part', 'interest', 'be', 'driven', 'what', 'might', 'do', 'career', 'Aaron', 'can', 'see', 'Tom', 'shortcomings', 'thinks', 'more', 'suitable', 'partner', 'Jane', 'clearly', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'best', 'friend', 'Jane', 'torn', 'Tom', 'looks', 'success', 'Aaron', 'friendship', 'competence', ""'ll"", 'let', 'find', 'out', 'resolution', 'yourself.Criterion', 'Blu-ray', 'presentation', 'excellent', 'film', 'better', 'ever', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'recent', 'interviews', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'cast', 'One', 'most', 'interesting', 'features', 'alternate', 'ending', 'comments', 'Brooks.Broadcast', 'News', 'unusual', 'make', 'technical', 'job', 'exciting', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'funny', 'intelligent', 'way', 'romantic', 'element', 'will', 'please', 'viewers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'failed', 'see', 'brilliance', 'when', 'first', 'watched', '20', 'years', 'ago']",Broadcast News VHS

The pace of the movie, particulary the scenes inside the workplace, is quick, and the side story of boy loves girl who loves someone else is fantastic.  This movie cemented Holly Hunter as one of my favorite actress (you must see her in &quot;Living Out Loud&quot; and &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot;) and Albert Brooks (as the guy who loves her) plays his character as goofy with an underlying seriousness -- I was completely charmed by his performance.But the best part of this movie is the ending, which I won't discuss, except to say that it's one of the few movies where I walked away feeling everything worked out EXACTLY as it should (i.e., not your typical romantic ending, but a satisfying one nonetheless).In sum, definately a must-see movie.",5,"A great, all-around movie",998438400,"08 22, 2001",2001,1160,"['rented', 'movie', 'being', 'told', 'reviewer', 'was', 'better', 'exploration', 'three-way', 'love', 'affair', 'quot', 'Keeping', 'Faith', 'quot', 'loved', 'quot', 'Keeping', 'quot', 'decided', 'give', 'try.Besides', 'being', 'great', 'story', 'unrequited', 'love', 'what', 'when', 'emotions', '3', 'people', 'get', 'tangled', 'great', 'story', 'regarding', 'broadcast', 'journalism', 'workplace', 'comedy', 'pace', 'movie', 'particulary', 'scenes', 'workplace', 'quick', 'side', 'story', 'boy', 'loves', 'girl', 'who', 'someone', 'else', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'cemented', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'one', 'favorite', 'actress', 'must', 'see', 'quot', 'Living', 'Out', 'Loud', 'quot', 'quot', 'Home', 'Holidays', 'quot', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'guy', 'who', 'character', 'goofy', 'underlying', 'seriousness', 'was', 'completely', 'charmed', 'performance.But', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'say', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'where', 'walked', 'away', 'feeling', 'everything', 'worked', 'out', 'EXACTLY', 'should', 'i.e.', 'not', 'typical', 'romantic', 'ending', 'satisfying', 'one', 'nonetheless', '.In', 'sum', 'definately', 'must-see', 'movie']",Broadcast News VHS
244587,A20TJ5P97W5MS1,6301066162,The Inquisitor,"[0, 0]","There's nothing like wrestling with a moral dilemma is there? Broadcast News is a 1987 film directed by James L. Brooks. This film makes a statement about the ethics of news reporting by combining romantic comedy with thoughtful substance. This film effectively tackles a very tough subject in a entertaining lighthearted manner. Aside from being an engaging drama Broadcast News is also a realistic view into the world of news reporting. It is a dramatic almost documentary style film that takes you behind the scenes of a network news station. In this 1980's charmer William Hurt plays the role of Tom Grunick. Tom is low on the talent and full of charisma. He is extremely popular and on the rise to network stardom. The only problem is that he has no knowledge or understanding of respectable news reporting. Will he fail or succeed? Holly Hunter plays the role of Jane Craig with determination and intensity. Jane is an extremely talented executive producer  who is torn over her attraction to Tom. He represents everything she is against yet she can not turn away. The man standing between them is Albert Brooks playing Aaron Altman. Aaron is a brilliant news reporter struggling to succeed in a system growing increasingly reliant on style and delivery. High ratings or respectable news coverage? The real question here is: Style or Substance? In Broadcast News an overwhelming case is made for each side. The movie soars because no matter what happens in the end everyone is a human being.

I was happy to finally see this arrive on dvd in its proper wide format. Out of curiosity I took out my oft-played VHS copy and compared the compositions. Understanding that many 1.85:1 pictures are merely 1.33:1 aspects with mattes placed on the top and bottom of the frame, I wasn't expecting to be too disappointed with the missing, albeit unintended, visual information. But I have to say - not only is the top and bottom masked off, but the SIDES are zoomed in and cropped as well. In other words you lose information on ALL FOUR SIDES, and it does NOT look good. This CANNOT be what James L. Brooks had in mind...could it?!?! Sorry to say, but this has to be one of the most RARE examples where the ""full-frame"", that is, full aperture is preferred over the letterboxed edition. Which brings me to my next point: somebody PLEASE re-issue this as a Special Edition, replete with commentaries, and any extra footage.
