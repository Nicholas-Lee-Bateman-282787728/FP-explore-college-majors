Read betwixt thee lines if you are looking for something else this is an all girls school. Now, its does not seem contrived but authentic experimentation. I chose to make this purchase over 100 others not because it was a good movie but because it came into my life at a curious time and I love English film.

It takes place during her summer vacation at the home of a family friend, Melissa. The young girl, Bilitis, is shocked when she witnesses her friend and her husband making love, however Melissa encourages Bilitis to discover the aspect of love by seeing a young photographer, Lucas.  When Lucas tries to make love to Bilitis, she rebuffs him and runs to Melissa, who in comforting Bilitis finds herself responding to her kisses and embraces.  Melissa tells Bilitis there must be nothing more between them.Bilitis discovers Melissa's husband is with another woman, so she decides to find another man for Melissa.  She returns with Nikias, a rich young man who has loved too many too well, and both Melissa and he know they cannot have an affair.  In the end Melissa and Lucas becomes lovers and Bilitis returns to her school realizing she is not yet ready for adulthood.The quality of the VHS movie, while watchable, is not very good.  However, the sound quality is even worse.  There is a lot of high frequency hiss that should have been filtered out in production.There is adult nudity, plenty of earl teen nudity (front/rear), adult themes and sexual situations (between Melissa and Bilitis).
