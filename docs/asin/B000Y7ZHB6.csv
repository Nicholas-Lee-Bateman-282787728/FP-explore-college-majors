At least he was into his role, as evidenced by his travels to the Superman convention in Metropolis, IL, and a 40 Year Old Virgin-like apartment festooned with action figures and cartoon posters.  All of the other characters use their superhero identities as means to an end, and are more or less panhandlers in costume.  These guys are no more passionate about their costumes than are Hollywood waitresses or pizza delivery men about their uniforms- it's just a matter of whether or not the getups can bring in rent money while waiting for dreams of grandeur to materialize.  For a lesson in contrasts, compare the superheroes' dedication to their labors to that of the nerds profiled in ""Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control.""And no one was particularly likeable in COAS.  Although his story is more interesting than the others, Superman's false claim to be the son of actress Sandy Dennis weakens his goofy charm.  Batman is a pathological liar, wannabe tough guy, and garden-variety jerk.  Wonder Woman is just young and clueless, and will surely strive to forget this time in her life when working some future office job.  The Hulk seems like a decent guy who has successfully put his former homeless life behind him, but lacks the looks and talent to break through any Hollywood barriers to entry.  [Not to mention he ""performs"" with a suffocating mask that won't get him noticed even if this was a proven track to attracting casting agents' attention.]  Worst of all, the four superheroes profiled aren't even particularly unique- there's scores more of them along Hollywood boulevard, some of whose tales are doubtlessly more interesting than those told in COAS, and none of whom will ever find real acting work.",2,Are These People Really Worth Knowing?,1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,2121,"['COAS', ""n't"", 'demonstrate', 'key', 'elements', 'essential', 'good', 'character', 'documentary', 'conveying', 'passion', 'subjects', 'documented', 'having', 'interesting', 'story', 'tell', 'making', 'audience', 'empathize', 'people', 'profiled', 'educating', 'viewers', 'something', 'previously', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'care', 'about.The', 'film', 'was', 'particularly', 'dispassionate', 'exception', 'guy', 'playing', 'Superman', 'least', 'was', 'role', 'evidenced', 'travels', 'Superman', 'convention', 'Metropolis', 'IL', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin-like', 'apartment', 'festooned', 'action', 'figures', 'cartoon', 'posters', 'other', 'characters', 'use', 'superhero', 'identities', 'means', 'end', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'panhandlers', 'costume', 'guys', 'are', 'more', 'passionate', 'costumes', 'are', 'Hollywood', 'waitresses', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'men', 'uniforms-', 'just', 'matter', 'not', 'getups', 'can', 'bring', 'rent', 'money', 'waiting', 'dreams', 'grandeur', 'materialize', 'lesson', 'contrasts', 'compare', 'superheroes', 'dedication', 'labors', 'nerds', 'profiled', 'Fast', 'Cheap', 'Out', 'Control', 'one', 'was', 'particularly', 'likeable', 'COAS', 'story', 'more', 'interesting', 'others', 'Superman', 'false', 'claim', 'be', 'son', 'actress', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'goofy', 'charm', 'Batman', 'pathological', 'liar', 'wannabe', 'tough', 'guy', 'garden-variety', 'jerk', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'just', 'young', 'clueless', 'will', 'surely', 'strive', 'forget', 'time', 'life', 'when', 'working', 'future', 'office', 'job', 'Hulk', 'decent', 'guy', 'who', 'successfully', 'put', 'former', 'homeless', 'life', 'looks', 'talent', 'break', 'Hollywood', 'barriers', 'entry', '[', 'Not', 'mention', 'performs', 'suffocating', 'mask', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'noticed', 'even', 'was', 'proven', 'track', 'attracting', 'casting', 'agents', 'attention', ']', 'Worst', 'four', 'superheroes', 'profiled', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'particularly', 'unique-', 'scores', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'boulevard', 'tales', 'are', 'doubtlessly', 'more', 'interesting', 'told', 'COAS', 'none', 'whom', 'will', 'ever', 'find', 'real', 'acting', 'work']",N/A
1116393,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,B000Y7ZHB6,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[4, 4]","A strangely appealing documentary focusing on the lives of four Hollywood Boulevard ""street-performers"" who trick-or-treat for a living by taking pictures with tourists dressed as four well-known superheroes for tips. But do they realize that outside of just one of them, they don't really look worthy of being handed that three dollars just to stand for the picture? But the one that's featured the most, Christopher Lloyd Dennis (above), who strikingly looks very similar to Christopher Reeve's Superman, is the doc's real draw. Obsessed with an apartment covered in Superman memorabilia, is almost as clean-cut as the Man Of Steel himself (outside a cigarette or two), taking his ""profession"" very seriously and asking the same of anyone else that happens to walk his path (Supe to Ghost Rider ""Would Ghost Rider ever take his mask off in front of kids? Then smoke a cigarette across the street? Of course not."").At times this documentary is one part funny, and one part scary, and one part just plain old sad. To hear each of these people tell their dream of becoming a famous actor the second they got off the bus to Hollywood, and then thinking that they sorta ""made-it"" by now walking around Grauman's Chinese Theatre (only allowed on the public sidewalk no less) in their home-made costumes can sometimes make your heart sink for them. And to see these guys, especially self-proclaimed former Italian hitman (not confirmed either) Batman, getting stiffed for a tip and watching him get violently irate can be a frightening expierence. I kept thinking to myself, ""Aren't they just a little bit insane?"" and the answer is probably, at least a bit mad. But you gotta give it up to them, especially Superman, who even goes to a Superman convention and gets married there, yes in that damn costume too, takes every bit of it as seriously as if he'll be starring in Superman V:The Quest For Dignity.

These four people dress as the superheroes (in order of names) Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and the Incredible Hulk on Hollywood Boulevard, taking pics with the tourists. This is their career of choice as they see it as their best chance of making it to movies, which some have done in independent films.The film explores what it's like being superheroes on the street, as they take tips for pictures. Some go about it more aggressively, even ending up getting arrested for ""aggressive begging"". The movie also goes into the personal lives of the four interviewed.Christopher Dennis (a Christopher Reeve look-a-like) is the veteran street performer out of the four, having played Superman on the streets for years. It shows his home and his huge Superman collection. He says that he is the son of the late actress Sandy Dennis, but it is never truly proven whether that is fact or fiction. Sandy's relatives are interviewed in the movie, but they have no knowledge of Chris. It is still a possibility that he is in fact her son, because she was a private person, but in the end you just have to make your own decision. It doesn't really matter anyway, because Chris is a real nice guy and it shows the entire film.Maxwell Allen (a George Clooney look-a-like) got into the ""superhero"" business by becoming friends with Christopher Dennis. He has an interesting story, which has a dark past. Whether you can believe most of what he says as fact is another thing that is up for questioning. The things that he says, even his wife doesn't 100% believe. Such as how he has killed a man who hurt his ex, but you won't find evidence because he was able to make a great cover up.Joseph McQueen walks the streets as the Incredible Hulk. He has it worst of all since he is in foam, even blacking out while working due to the 106 degree heat. Jennifer Gerht is a beautiful woman that got into this so that she could be famous in Hollywood. This lifestyle seems to effect her most of all, even costing her a marriage by the end.Call it pan handling. Call it street performing. Call it anything you want. By the end of the movie, you will love these people anyway. They are just normal people who have chosen this as a job and have succeeded in some ways at making their dream come true.

Has-been, never-was aspiring actors make their way to the West in dream of stardom, no doubt trumped up by friends and family in small towns nation-wide.  The film focuses on four superhero impersonators, people who didn't quite make it, and refuse to grasp the reality that the world needs ditch diggers, too.  The foursome are the cornerstones of comic book culture: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and The Incredible Hulk.Along with the haircut and jawline to play Superman, the refined schtick isn't enough to overlook the concave chest on the actor portraying the Man of Steel.  He takes his ""profession"" WAY too seriously, and conveys an eccentricity that borders on insanity.  He's the kind of guy whose movie rental history probably has equal parts cartoons (for research), Teletubbies, and Japanese tentacle porn, with 8MM filling in at every fifth rental.The guy who plays Batman looks like George Clooney's gap-toothed, slack-jawed clone.  He'd be somewhat bearable if not for the intense anger management problems, and the fact that he thinks that every person who crosses his path should throw money his way.A young woman from Tennessee plays Wonder Woman.  The problem is, she fancies herself the real Wonder Woman, and she has a sense of entitlement in her like she's a celebrated star.  There is no doubt in my mind that she feels she should actually BE a big star already.  She'd turn up her nose at Angelina Jolie and Halle Berry.In an expressionless Hulk costume, hiding in anonymity rather than being seen, is probably the most likeable of the entire cast.  He was formerly living on the street, and seems genuinely appreciative of the tips, rather than scornful of the amount like the other three.  I'd actually tip this guy because he's not intrusive and belligerent about the tips.As they traipse about on the boulevard of broken dreams, Hollywood Boulevard, it's borderline sad how they nearly grovel for tips before, during, and after every photo opportunity, but irksome trumps sad.  Imagine how irritating it would be if a waitress constantly mentioned that a tip would be appreciated.  While being called pan-handlers by the mayor of Hollywood, I just wanted to scream at them to get a real job.  But then I thought, do they have one?Maybe the documentary was unfair to the quartet.  Aside from The Hulk, however, I wouldn't tip them.  To me they're no different than the beggars in New York, and that one guy sitting outside every baseball stadium in America who can barely play the sax.  Actually, I think the guy who plays the sax deserves a tip more.",3,It's a bird!  It's a plane!

Martin ""Jeff Punk Rock Martin""","[8, 13]","Here's a fact any sane person would recognize: pulling on a pair of tights and prancing around Hollywood Boulevard for tip money doesn't make you a superhero. What the subjects of this documentary don't quite get, though, is that it doesn't really make you an actor, either. But then, nobody is ever going to accuse this film's Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman or Incredible Hulk of having a stranglehold on reality.Which brings us to the subject of delusion - a central theme of ""Confessions of a Superhero."" It's not that this film's four main figures are completely in orbit. In fact, a couple of them seem pretty sane. A couple of them. Even the dream of becoming a movie star - as monumentally farfetched as it may be - is shared by enough of the population that it alone can't reasonably be called pathological. But, combine a lack of self-awareness with profoundly poor judgment about how to go about actually achieving stardom and what do you get? Well, a really angry guy in a Batman suit.Angry Batman seems to be delusional about a lot of things. He wants to be an actor, but attributes his lack of success, in part, to looking 'too much like George Clooney.' He fancies himself a martial arts expert but seems confused following even the simplest instructions in kung-fu school. Oh, and he tells questionable tales of hits he's made as a muscle guy for the Mob. (This he spills to a shrink while wearing full, dimestore Batman garb.) By contrast, the Superman-fixated Christopher Dennis seems positively sunny. Sure, he goes around spinning yarns of illustrious parentage, and he does seem to confuse building Superman-themed dioramas out of cardboard with building an acting career. But what the hell? At least he's getting his face out there for people in the business to see! Not that the 'people in the business' spend much time on Hollywood Boulevard having their pictures taken with lanky guys in bad Superman outfits, but that's how this delusion thing works.To be fair, the Batman and Superman we see here seem much more out of whack than the film's other principals. The guy in the Hulk suit seems like a sweet man...and he does manage to catch a very small break in the course of the film. And our Wonder Woman? Pretty, small-town gal goes to Hollywood, walks up and down the street in a skimpy outfit and takes money from strangers. Let's just say that, given those circumstances, pretending to be Wonder Woman is not the most demeaning thing she could be doing.So, if the previous paragraphs haven't made it clear, ""Confessions of a Superhero"" can be a lot of fun. But the question that arises when watching such a film is this: should we feel a little unclean laughing at these people? After all, unlike the subjects of the sweeter and more deftly crafted ""Trekkies,"" our fake Batman and Superman are not just overzealous fanboys with an amped-up hobby. They're desperate people with fairly sad little lives. While ""Confessions"" may not quite go for the jugular in making sport of its subjects, it doesn't exactly spare their feelings, either. It may be a funny movie for you and me, but I'd hardly guess that Angry Batman would share that opinion.",3,If Delusion were a Superpower,1209686400,"05 2, 2008",2008,3170,"['Here', 'fact', 'sane', 'person', 'would', 'recognize', 'pulling', 'pair', 'tights', 'prancing', 'around', 'Hollywood', 'Boulevard', 'tip', 'money', ""n't"", 'make', 'superhero', 'What', 'subjects', 'documentary', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'actor', 'either', 'then', 'nobody', 'ever', 'going', 'accuse', 'film', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'having', 'stranglehold', 'reality.Which', 'brings', 'subject', 'delusion', 'central', 'theme', 'Confessions', 'Superhero', 'not', 'film', 'four', 'main', 'figures', 'are', 'completely', 'orbit', 'fact', 'couple', 'seem', 'pretty', 'sane', 'couple', 'Even', 'dream', 'becoming', 'movie', 'star', 'monumentally', 'farfetched', 'may', 'be', 'shared', 'enough', 'population', 'alone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reasonably', 'be', 'called', 'pathological', 'combine', 'lack', 'self-awareness', 'profoundly', 'poor', 'judgment', 'how', 'go', 'actually', 'achieving', 'stardom', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'Well', 'really', 'angry', 'guy', 'Batman', 'suit.Angry', 'Batman', 'be', 'delusional', 'lot', 'things', 'be', 'actor', 'lack', 'success', 'part', 'looking', ""'too"", 'much', 'George', 'Clooney', 'martial', 'arts', 'expert', 'confused', 'following', 'even', 'simplest', 'instructions', 'kung-fu', 'school', 'Oh', 'questionable', 'tales', 'hits', 'made', 'muscle', 'guy', 'Mob', 'shrink', 'wearing', 'full', 'dimestore', 'Batman', 'garb', 'contrast', 'Superman-fixated', 'Christopher', 'Dennis', 'positively', 'sunny', 'Sure', 'spinning', 'yarns', 'illustrious', 'parentage', 'seem', 'confuse', 'building', 'Superman-themed', 'dioramas', 'cardboard', 'building', 'acting', 'career', 'what', 'hell', 'least', 'getting', 'face', 'there', 'people', 'business', 'see', 'Not', ""'people"", 'business', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'Boulevard', 'having', 'pictures', 'taken', 'lanky', 'guys', 'bad', 'Superman', 'how', 'delusion', 'thing', 'works.To', 'be', 'fair', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'see', 'here', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'whack', 'film', 'other', 'principals', 'guy', 'Hulk', 'suit', 'sweet', 'man', 'manage', 'catch', 'very', 'small', 'break', 'course', 'film', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Pretty', 'small-town', 'gal', 'Hollywood', 'street', 'skimpy', 'outfit', 'money', 'strangers', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'given', 'circumstances', 'pretending', 'be', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'not', 'most', 'demeaning', 'thing', 'could', 'be', 'doing.So', 'previous', 'paragraphs', 'have', ""n't"", 'made', 'clear', 'Confessions', 'Superhero', 'can', 'be', 'lot', 'fun', 'question', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'should', 'feel', 'little', 'unclean', 'laughing', 'people', 'subjects', 'sweeter', 'more', 'deftly', 'crafted', 'Trekkies', 'fake', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'overzealous', 'fanboys', 'amped-up', 'hobby', ""'re"", 'desperate', 'people', 'fairly', 'sad', 'little', 'lives', 'Confessions', 'may', 'not', 'quite', 'go', 'jugular', 'making', 'sport', 'subjects', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'spare', 'feelings', 'either', 'may', 'be', 'funny', 'movie', ""'d"", 'hardly', 'guess', 'Angry', 'Batman', 'would', 'share', 'opinion']",N/A

Driscoll,"[1, 1]","Little known documentarian Matt Ogens creates a film that just may rise above its appeal to superhero fans, because it is far more compelling from a psychological standpoint.  In fact, I would think that most fans of superheroes might even be turned off after possibly seeing little bits of themselves in some of the extreme characters Ogens observes closely in Confessions of a Superhero.The film follows four Hollywood star wannabes, whose slim options have landed them on Hollywood boulevard dressing up as famous superheroes, and hoping for tips as tourists take pictures with them.  They are actors at best and panhandlers at worst, but I couldn't help but admire these people in doses for their resourcefulness.Firstly, we have Christopher Dennis, who actually claims to be the son of late actress Sandy Dennis.  Chris is a keeper of all sorts of Superman memorabilia and of the four subjects, this is a man destined to do this work.  He is literally a second rate superman.  It is as if he is a Christopher Reeve stunt double fromSuperman IV - The Quest for Peace, by far the least appealing in the mediocrefilm series.

Max and his wife claim he looks like George Clooney, and he could very well have been a stunt double for Clooney inBatman & Robin, by far the least appealing in that mediocrefilm series.  Playing the Incredible Hulk on the streets of Hollywood is the awkward but super nice guy Joe McQueen, who was at one time homeless and is gradually getting what he sees as some degree of success in town.  He was the easiest to empathize with and I really hope he makes it, but Hollywood is a cold cold place.  Lastly, we have the very attractive Jennifer Wenger, playing Wonder Woman.  She is actually the only one I can see making it.  She has appeared onMy Name is Earland a few other things, and has a certain comical charm that should get her more work.Confessions of a Superhero was one of the most enjoyable documentaries I've seen in a while.  All of my questions about these people were asked in a satisfactory way, and there are some pretty surprising things that occur throughout the film.  Confessions of a Superhero doesn't make any profound statements, it is just another documentary showing us something we may not have previously known anything about, akin toDarkonorThe King of Kong.

1116399,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,B000Y7ZHB6,Kerry Walters,"[14, 15]","There's something reminiscent of a Hubert Selby, Jr. novel about Matt Ogens' ""Confessions of a Superhero.""  The four characters chronicled by the film all dream big, but the gap between their dreams and the reality of their lives is unbridgeable.  At times, when they pause to look at their cluttered studio apartments or their broken relationships or their bizarre lifestyles, they seem to grasp this.  But they quickly retreat from their encounters with reality to go on chasing the Great American Dream (or is it Great American Nightmare?) of celebrityhood.""Confessions"" focuses on four aspiring actors--or, more accurately, four Hollywood star wannabes--who land in Tinseltown in pursuit of their dreams only to wind up on the streets working the tourist trade as costume-clad superheroes.  One of them, Superman is wacky, although in an almost endearing way.  One of them, Batman, is a frightening character who has violent tendencies and seems to be a compulsive liar as well.  One of them, the Hulk, is a charming young black man who lived on the streets for a while.  And the last of them, Wonder Woman, is a naive kid from the south who ran off to Las Vegas to marry a guy she'd met two weeks earlier.  The Hulk and Wonder Woman break your heart, Superman is a jaw-dropping eccentric, and Batman is just plain creepy.  But all four of them attest to the downward spiral that the obsession with fame and fortune in an unforgiving culture of celebrity can bring.  This spiral is even more poignant given that it leads the four to pose as superheroes, which is exactly what they're not in reality.Ogen never mocks his subjects, and that's good.  He doesn't make value judgments about their lives or the choices they've made.  If anything, his film suggests that he's more sympathetic to them than not.  But it's also clear from the film that he agrees with the conclusion the viewer is likely to come to: each of the four ""superheroes"" is living in denial.  The unstated but obvious challenge Ogen leaves us with is to ask ourselves whether our own dreams are as self-serving, tawdry, and ultimately unrealistic, as those of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and the Hulk.",4,Land of broken dreams,1218412800,"08 11, 2008",2008,2176,"['something', 'reminiscent', 'Hubert', 'Selby', 'Jr.', 'novel', 'Matt', 'Ogens', 'Confessions', 'Superhero', 'four', 'characters', 'chronicled', 'film', 'dream', 'big', 'gap', 'dreams', 'reality', 'lives', 'unbridgeable', 'times', 'when', 'pause', 'look', 'cluttered', 'studio', 'apartments', 'broken', 'relationships', 'bizarre', 'lifestyles', 'seem', 'grasp', 'quickly', 'retreat', 'encounters', 'reality', 'go', 'chasing', 'Great', 'American', 'Dream', 'Great', 'American', 'Nightmare', 'celebrityhood', 'Confessions', 'four', 'aspiring', 'actors', 'more', 'accurately', 'four', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'wannabes', 'who', 'land', 'Tinseltown', 'pursuit', 'dreams', 'only', 'wind', 'up', 'streets', 'working', 'tourist', 'trade', 'costume-clad', 'superheroes', 'One', 'Superman', 'wacky', 'almost', 'endearing', 'way', 'One', 'Batman', 'frightening', 'character', 'who', 'violent', 'tendencies', 'be', 'compulsive', 'liar', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'Hulk', 'charming', 'young', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'lived', 'streets', 'while', 'last', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'naive', 'kid', 'south', 'who', 'ran', 'off', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'marry', 'guy', ""'d"", 'met', 'two', 'weeks', 'earlier', 'Hulk', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'break', 'heart', 'Superman', 'jaw-dropping', 'eccentric', 'Batman', 'just', 'plain', 'creepy', 'four', 'attest', 'downward', 'spiral', 'obsession', 'fame', 'fortune', 'unforgiving', 'culture', 'celebrity', 'can', 'bring', 'spiral', 'even', 'more', 'poignant', 'given', 'four', 'pose', 'superheroes', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'not', 'reality.Ogen', 'never', 'subjects', 'good', ""n't"", 'make', 'value', 'judgments', 'lives', 'choices', ""'ve"", 'made', 'anything', 'film', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'not', 'also', 'clear', 'film', 'conclusion', 'viewer', 'likely', 'come', 'four', 'superheroes', 'living', 'denial', 'unstated', 'obvious', 'challenge', 'Ogen', 'ask', 'own', 'dreams', 'are', 'self-serving', 'tawdry', 'ultimately', 'unrealistic', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Hulk']",N/A

Its subject matter- the lives an passions of struggling actors who make their livings by dressing up as superheroes and taking pictures with Hollywood tourists for ""tips""- is jarringly unique, because it directs our attention to something that most of have never even given a second though to. Indeed, the movie's greatest strength is the warmth and humanity with which it portrays its central characters. It skillfully avoids mockery and melodrama, exploring the quirks of its subjects with good-natured humor, revealing their dreams and struggles with genuine sympathy. The end result is a twisted, but undeniably powerful, take on fame, hope, and the good ol' American Dream. It's occasionally boring, and sometimes redundant, but even its weaker moments are tolerable. And if it never reaches any truly euphoric high points or cathartic epiphanies, that's mostly because life doesn't have many of those. That's not what this movie's about, anyway.

Remember when we were kids and wanted to be super heroes?  What happens when, as a grown up, you wear a super hero costume to earn a living?  Do you feel more powerful?  Or does it highlight your failures?  The film maker does an amazing job of documenting the lives of people who choose to dress up like superheroes.  We meet Superman, Batman, The Incredible Hulk and Wonder Woman.  They tend to see it as acting or attemtping to be even a tiny cog in the Hollywood industry.  Others see it as a form of pan handling.Chris Dennis, aka Superman, has become infamous in his own right and carries on the tragic story of people who become associated with Superman.  He claims to be the son of oscar winning actress Sandy Dennis and obsessively collects Superman memorabilia.  He tends to wear his Superman outfit all of the time.  This man needs help but who is he really harming if it makes him happy and able to function?  But you know you got problems when Margot Kidder calls you odd.  This character is given the most screen time and his story is fascinating.Batman is another interesting character.  He has delusions of grandeur and anger issues.  He likes to have a mysterious bad guy past.  Wonder Woman is a southern transplant who yearned for brighter lights then those of her small town.  She was Homecoming Queen and everything else and figured she could try to make it in Hollywood.  This character seemed the most grounded if a little superficial.  I cringed when I heard her talk about her marriage - any part of it!  Lastly, there is the Hulk. Another southern transplant who even when he was homeless, never gave up on his dream of being in the movies.  I liked this man and rooted for him every step of the way.Matt Ogen did a brillant job of letting the actors/actress present themselves.  I did not feel like the film was edited to obtain a particular slant.  By the end of the film,  the audience feels each actors desperate yearning for stardom.

1116402,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000Y7ZHB6,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[4, 4]","Confessions of a Superhero gives us a fascinating look at the lives of four people. These people dress up everyday as comic book characters and stand on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles posing for photos with tourists. We see their daily frustrations as some tourists decline to tip them; they aren't allowed under the law to formally charge a fee for a photo of themselves with the tourists and that can be tough. They also have to contend with law enforcement officers making sure that they aren't harassing people and that they're staying on the ""public area"" of the sidewalk. On the other hand, one young woman who dresses up as Wonder Woman says that on a good day she can make hundreds of dollars in tips--and that's great!The documentary flows along nicely and it chooses to focus on the four people who dress up as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and The Hulk although there is some brief footage of a woman who dresses up every day as Marilyn Monroe and another who wears a Sesame Street Elmo costume. We get to know them as they tell their stories to the camera and we learn even more about them as we watch them interact with people on Hollywood Boulevard. These people would love to be full fledged actors making huge amounts of money in movies; but the reality is that the competition for juicy, lucrative roles is so tight that they have to stay with the work they currently do dressing up as comic book characters for photos if they want to make money doing something that makes them happy.The person who touched me the most with their story would be Joseph McQueen who dresses up as The Hulk everyday. He's had it rough--four years of homelessness on the streets of Los Angeles with apparently no family to send him money for even just basic shelter with a roommate. The temperature inside his costume is almost unbearable during the long hot days of summer; in one scene he tells the people playing Superman and Wonder Woman that he ""blacked out"" at a nearby restaurant. The heat does get to the others, too. Will he make it into a movie? Watch and find out!Another interesting story would be that of the gentleman who plays Superman. He says he's the son of actress Sandy Dennis even though Sandy's own brother never heard of her having any children at all! Christopher Dennis has decorated (and dedicated) his cramped apartment completely to Superman and very similar action figures prominently displays on the walls. He certainly gets emotional about playing Superman and we see how he's tearful when Christopher Reeve passes away. We also meet his girlfriend Bonnie and watch as he enters a look-alike contest in Metropolis, Illinois--will he win? What's in store for him and Bonnie--and his job as a character actor posing for tips on Hollywood Boulevard?Two other people we learn so much about would be Jennifer Wenger who dresses up as Wonder Woman; her hasty marriage to a young man might not always bring them happiness. How will this work out? We see that she's got herself a Hollywood agent and she's trying out for commercials--will she get a break? In addition, Maxwell Allen dresses up as Batman; but when he looks for more serious work as an actor he must contend with the fact that he looks too much like George Clooney to get acting jobs. He also has an anger management problem and on one occasion he fights with other people so badly that things don't exactly go smoothly for him.The DVD comes with numerous extras. I particularly liked ""When Bonnie Met Superman;"" ""Superman Loves Bo Duke"" and the audio commentary with Christopher ""Superman"" Dennis and his wife Bonnie.Confessions of a Superhero explores the topic of what it would be like to actually grow up to be the superhero you always dreamed of when you were a kid. Are you really that type of person--or are you not? Of course, it is also about actors struggling to get themselves recognized in a market that is remarkably highly competitive.",5,"fantastic documentary--GREAT JOB, EVERYONE !!!",1245456000,"06 20, 2009",2009,3938,"['Confessions', 'Superhero', 'fascinating', 'look', 'lives', 'four', 'people', 'people', 'dress', 'up', 'everyday', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'stand', 'Hollywood', 'Boulevard', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'posing', 'photos', 'tourists', 'see', 'daily', 'frustrations', 'tourists', 'decline', 'tip', 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'law', 'formally', 'charge', 'fee', 'photo', 'tourists', 'can', 'be', 'tough', 'also', 'have', 'contend', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officers', 'making', 'sure', 'are', ""n't"", 'harassing', 'people', ""'re"", 'staying', 'public', 'area', 'sidewalk', 'other', 'hand', 'one', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'up', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'good', 'day', 'can', 'make', 'hundreds', 'dollars', 'tips', 'great', 'documentary', 'flows', 'nicely', 'focus', 'four', 'people', 'who', 'dress', 'up', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Hulk', 'brief', 'footage', 'woman', 'who', 'up', 'day', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'who', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'Elmo', 'costume', 'get', 'know', 'tell', 'stories', 'camera', 'learn', 'even', 'more', 'about', 'watch', 'interact', 'people', 'Hollywood', 'Boulevard', 'people', 'would', 'love', 'be', 'full', 'fledged', 'actors', 'making', 'huge', 'amounts', 'money', 'movies', 'reality', 'competition', 'juicy', 'lucrative', 'roles', 'so', 'tight', 'have', 'stay', 'work', 'currently', 'do', 'dressing', 'up', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'photos', 'want', 'make', 'money', 'doing', 'something', 'happy.The', 'person', 'who', 'touched', 'most', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'Joseph', 'McQueen', 'who', 'up', 'Hulk', 'everyday', 'had', 'rough', 'four', 'years', 'homelessness', 'streets', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'apparently', 'family', 'send', 'money', 'even', 'just', 'basic', 'shelter', 'roommate', 'temperature', 'costume', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'long', 'hot', 'days', 'summer', 'one', 'scene', 'people', 'playing', 'Superman', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'blacked', 'out', 'nearby', 'restaurant', 'heat', 'get', 'others', 'too', 'Will', 'make', 'movie', 'Watch', 'find', 'out', 'interesting', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'gentleman', 'who', 'Superman', 'son', 'actress', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'even', 'Sandy', 'own', 'brother', 'never', 'heard', 'having', 'children', 'Christopher', 'Dennis', 'decorated', 'dedicated', 'cramped', 'apartment', 'completely', 'Superman', 'very', 'similar', 'action', 'figures', 'prominently', 'displays', 'walls', 'certainly', 'emotional', 'playing', 'Superman', 'see', 'how', 'tearful', 'when', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'away', 'also', 'meet', 'girlfriend', 'Bonnie', 'watch', 'look-alike', 'contest', 'Metropolis', 'Illinois', 'will', 'win', 'What', 'store', 'Bonnie', 'job', 'character', 'actor', 'posing', 'tips', 'Hollywood', 'Boulevard', 'Two', 'other', 'people', 'learn', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'be', 'Jennifer', 'Wenger', 'who', 'up', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'hasty', 'marriage', 'young', 'man', 'might', 'not', 'always', 'bring', 'happiness', 'How', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'see', 'got', 'Hollywood', 'agent', 'trying', 'out', 'commercials', 'will', 'get', 'break', 'addition', 'Maxwell', 'Allen', 'up', 'Batman', 'when', 'more', 'serious', 'work', 'actor', 'must', 'contend', 'fact', 'too', 'much', 'George', 'Clooney', 'get', 'acting', 'jobs', 'also', 'anger', 'management', 'problem', 'one', 'occasion', 'other', 'people', 'so', 'badly', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'go', 'smoothly', 'him.The', 'DVD', 'numerous', 'extras', 'particularly', 'liked', 'When', 'Bonnie', 'Met', 'Superman', 'Superman', 'Bo', 'Duke', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Christopher', 'Superman', 'Dennis', 'wife', 'Bonnie.Confessions', 'Superhero', 'topic', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'actually', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'superhero', 'always', 'dreamed', 'when', 'were', 'kid', 'Are', 'really', 'type', 'person', 'are', 'not', 'course', 'also', 'actors', 'struggling', 'get', 'recognized', 'market', 'remarkably', 'highly', 'competitive']",N/A

Christopher Dennis, the Christopher Reeve lookalike--albeit a seedier, more rundown version, with fake muscles in the suit--was probably the most interesting, and also perhaps the most pathetic. I am a sucker for movies featuring unusual people who seek a different path in life, even if they are a bit sad and pathetic. Maybe they make me feel better about myself? All of the folks in this film have succumbed to the lure of Hollywood and its seductive promise of fame and riches and glory. But they'd be better off waiting tables; the pay would be better and the work more secure.No jest, I was in LA, at Graumann's Chinese two days ago.

The four people who are the focus of Confessions support themselves by working as super hero ""lookalikes.""  They invite tourists to take their pictures in exchange for tips.The film focuses on -1) Maxwell Allen (Batman) who says that he is a gangster and a murderer. He has a big anger management problem.2) Christopher Dennis (Superman) who says that he is the son of actress Sandy Dennis. Her family denies that Christopher is Dennis' son. Christopher is a Superman fanatic; he seems less interested in becoming a successful actor than in playing Superman.3) Jennifer Wenger (Wonder Woman) who dropped out of college and caught a plane to L.A. the next day. She has a failing marriage and an agent who tells her that she needs to accept the fact that she has a ""voluptuous"" figure.4) Joseph McQueen (The Incredible Hulk) who says that he was homeless for several years. He says that he came to LA during the Rodney King riots and thought that he would be harmed in the violence.This is a movie about dreams. We don't really know if the stories that these people tell are true; in the cases of Allen and Dennis, there is evidence that they are lying. In Hollywood, the lies seem unimportant; the town, after all, is based on useful illusions. All four people are adamant that they will not give up on their dreams.My only complaint is that too many others have also told the story of the Hollywood wannabe determined to succeed against all odds.There is a lot of human interest in this film. What does it mean to chase your dreams? What would it mean to give up? I recommend this film if those questions interest you.",4,The Power of Dreams,1263772800,"01 18, 2010",2010,1728,"['Confessions', 'Super', 'Hero', 'film', 'dreamers', 'who', 'flock', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'entertainers', 'four', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'focus', 'Confessions', 'support', 'working', 'super', 'hero', 'lookalikes', 'invite', 'tourists', 'take', 'pictures', 'exchange', 'tips.The', 'film', '-1', 'Maxwell', 'Allen', 'Batman', 'who', 'gangster', 'murderer', 'big', 'anger', 'management', 'problem.2', 'Christopher', 'Dennis', 'Superman', 'who', 'son', 'actress', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'family', 'Christopher', 'Dennis', 'son', 'Christopher', 'Superman', 'fanatic', 'less', 'interested', 'becoming', 'successful', 'actor', 'playing', 'Superman.3', 'Jennifer', 'Wenger', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'who', 'dropped', 'college', 'caught', 'plane', 'L.A.', 'next', 'day', 'failing', 'marriage', 'agent', 'who', 'accept', 'fact', 'voluptuous', 'figure.4', 'Joseph', 'McQueen', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'who', 'was', 'homeless', 'several', 'years', 'came', 'LA', 'Rodney', 'King', 'riots', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'harmed', 'violence.This', 'movie', 'dreams', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'stories', 'people', 'tell', 'are', 'true', 'cases', 'Allen', 'Dennis', 'evidence', 'are', 'lying', 'Hollywood', 'lies', 'seem', 'unimportant', 'town', 'based', 'useful', 'illusions', 'four', 'people', 'are', 'adamant', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'dreams.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'too', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'also', 'told', 'story', 'Hollywood', 'wannabe', 'determined', 'succeed', 'lot', 'human', 'interest', 'film', 'What', 'mean', 'chase', 'dreams', 'What', 'would', 'mean', 'give', 'up', 'recommend', 'film', 'questions', 'interest']",N/A
1116409,A2ZHH7AK83JB5G,B000Y7ZHB6,"Susan K. Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[23, 28]","CONFESSIONS OF A SUPERHERO is a very well made documentary that is enjoyable to watch.  The four people the film focuses on are street performers who make or enhance their livelihoods by dressing up as superheros, hanging out on Hollywood Boulevard and having their pictures taken with tourists for ""tips"".  The tone of the film is very respectful toward this rather odd quartet that portray Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and The Incredible Hulk.  Other Hollywood ""characters"" are briefly mentioned or seen in the film but the movie's attention is almost totally on these four.The men playing Superman and Batman do look a bit like low rent versions of Christopher Reeve and George Clooney.  Superman is a very likable oddball who claims to be the late actress Sandy Dennis's son despite the fact that she had no children and her surviving relatives know nothing about this man.  Batman admits to an anger management problem and confesses to a dark past that his own wife estimates is about 50% true but this viewer would guess the truth percentage is even lower and most of the information in this past seems to have popular movies as its source.  Jenny who dresses as Wonder Woman is a pretty if slightly plump (by Hollywood standards) young woman who left her small Tennessee town to pursue acting in LA.  She is much more in touch with reality than Batman and Superman though she is frustrated in the lack of positive movement toward her acting dreams and we see her young marriage break apart.  Joe McQueen is the fourth member of the quartet, a formerly homeless African American man, who wears a suffocatingly hot Incredible Hulk suit and seems the character most likely to actually find some Hollywood success and  is cast in a movie during the course of the documentary. A major strength of the film is it avoids seeming condescending to its subjects and only a bit of the superhero's home lives seems staged.  This is a great documentary for anyone interested in the lower layer of Hollywood or people living out unusual life choices.",4,"Respectful Documentary About Four Hollywood ""Characters""",1201910400,"02 2, 2008",2008,2045,"['CONFESSIONS', 'A', 'SUPERHERO', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'documentary', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'four', 'people', 'film', 'are', 'street', 'performers', 'who', 'make', 'enhance', 'livelihoods', 'dressing', 'up', 'superheros', 'hanging', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'Boulevard', 'having', 'pictures', 'taken', 'tourists', 'tips', 'tone', 'film', 'very', 'respectful', 'rather', 'odd', 'quartet', 'portray', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Other', 'Hollywood', 'characters', 'are', 'briefly', 'mentioned', 'seen', 'film', 'movie', 'attention', 'almost', 'totally', 'four.The', 'men', 'playing', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'do', 'look', 'bit', 'low', 'rent', 'versions', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Superman', 'very', 'likable', 'oddball', 'who', 'be', 'late', 'actress', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'son', 'fact', 'had', 'children', 'surviving', 'relatives', 'know', 'nothing', 'man', 'Batman', 'anger', 'management', 'problem', 'dark', 'own', 'wife', 'estimates', '50', '%', 'true', 'viewer', 'would', 'guess', 'truth', 'percentage', 'even', 'lower', 'most', 'information', 'past', 'have', 'popular', 'movies', 'source', 'Jenny', 'who', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'pretty', 'slightly', 'plump', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'left', 'small', 'Tennessee', 'town', 'pursue', 'acting', 'LA', 'much', 'more', 'touch', 'reality', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'frustrated', 'lack', 'positive', 'movement', 'acting', 'dreams', 'see', 'young', 'marriage', 'break', 'apart', 'Joe', 'McQueen', 'fourth', 'member', 'quartet', 'formerly', 'homeless', 'African', 'American', 'man', 'who', 'suffocatingly', 'hot', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'suit', 'character', 'most', 'likely', 'actually', 'find', 'Hollywood', 'success', 'cast', 'movie', 'course', 'documentary', 'major', 'strength', 'film', 'avoids', 'seeming', 'condescending', 'subjects', 'only', 'bit', 'superhero', 'home', 'staged', 'great', 'documentary', 'anyone', 'interested', 'lower', 'layer', 'Hollywood', 'people', 'living', 'out', 'unusual', 'life', 'choices']",N/A
