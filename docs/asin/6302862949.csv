341482,A1MNRQCTURUNLF,6302862949,"""alenchik""","[197, 204]","Frankly, I don't see why everybody is so up in arms about the quality of this movie.  I, for one, don't need to preface my review with a disclaimer that only its dance sequences can be enjoyed.  I happen to think that it's a pretty excellent cinematographic work overall.  Let me elaborate.The camera work here is among the most original and clever out there.  It's incredibly dynamic and energetic, offering unusual perspectives, delivering great close-ups, and skillfully capturing the sweeping wide spaces.  An unusually large amount of footage is devoted to the city landscapes of St. Petersburg - a rarity in American flicks on Russian themes.  It's all the more jarring, however, that despite attempts to ensure authenticity of the setting, at least the first couple of car rides seem to have been done in a stationary vehicle and plastered rather crudely against the city background.  But this is a forgivable and almost charming flaw, considering the film's limited budget and the release year of 1985.The film is a paradox of sorts, showcasing interesting performances from Rossellini and Hines, two actors who have since been totally under-appreciated.  There's good chemistry between the impressionable and high-strung duet of Darya and Raymond.  Jerzy Skolimovski (Colonel Chaiko) is the classical cunning villain with a Slavic flare.  Baryshnikov himself seems a bit rigid and somewhat formulaic as Nikolay Rodchenko.  That is when he's not dancing, of course.  For when he dances, he unleashes all imaginable and unimaginable potential.Obviously, the story line is sketched out in broad, exaggerated strokes.  But I bet the filmmakers actually expected the overall theatricality to be taken with a grain of salt.  Besides, the subject matter discussed wasn't keen on subtleties.  The events depicted were behind-the-scenes operations all right, but they were as blunt and theatrically bizarre as can be.  And as for those who think the circumstances and emotions of the dissidence and emigration (or defection in this case) experience are overblown - brush up on mid-20th century history and get a grip on things.  Not only had the Big Brother's machinery of state control and suppression been well oiled for decades in the Soviet Union and its satellites, but the shadow of this absurd, merciless beast hangs over many of those nations still.  Folks, the fictionalized account of Nikolay Rodchenko is merely a _slightly_ glamorized and dramatized version of real life experience of countless victims of the era.The scenes of Nikolay and Darya fleeing through the deserted streets of Leningrad and the subsequent humiliation they experience in front of the American embassy send chills down my spine every time I watch the movie.  That threat and that danger are very real to me even though my emigration experience in the 1990s was simply peachy in retrospect and comparison.  Just as disturbing and sobering, by the way, is Rodchenko's reception by the Americans and the so-called international community inside the gates.  He to them is but a nimble exotic specimen...Anyhow, let me dismount my high horse and reiterate, seconding the earlier reviews, that &quot;White Nights&quot; features superb, matchless dancing; and, to miss it is a deathly sin.  Well, almost...There are essentially four dance highlights in the movie.  Choreography is mainly by Baryshnikov, Hines, and, very importantly, Twyla Tharp.  Baryshnikov's duet with Florence Faure in the opening credits is bound to leave your breathless. It is sheer perfection - immensely inventive and impeccably executed.  The second instance when you'll forget that you could blink and breathe is during the 11 rubles for 11 pirouettes number.  He does it with a godly effortlessness.  Hines' and Baryshnikov's dance studio number is fascinating to watch. And, then... Then, there's Mikhail's solo to Vysotsky's tape on the stage of the Kirov theatre.  Its beauty is literally painful and words can never describe it.If you haven't seen &quot;White Nights&quot; or have seen it only once, you're denying yourself an unearthly pleasure.  And you can snicker at my high-flown sighs and exclamations all you want :)",5,Mistakenly Underrated,992390400,"06 13, 2001",2001,4185,"['Frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'everybody', 'so', 'up', 'arms', 'quality', 'movie', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'preface', 'review', 'disclaimer', 'only', 'dance', 'sequences', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'happen', 'think', 'pretty', 'excellent', 'cinematographic', 'work', 'overall', 'Let', 'elaborate.The', 'camera', 'work', 'here', 'most', 'original', 'clever', 'there', 'incredibly', 'dynamic', 'energetic', 'offering', 'unusual', 'perspectives', 'delivering', 'great', 'close-ups', 'skillfully', 'capturing', 'sweeping', 'wide', 'spaces', 'unusually', 'large', 'amount', 'footage', 'devoted', 'city', 'landscapes', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'rarity', 'American', 'flicks', 'Russian', 'themes', 'more', 'jarring', 'however', 'attempts', 'ensure', 'authenticity', 'setting', 'least', 'first', 'couple', 'car', 'rides', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'stationary', 'vehicle', 'plastered', 'rather', 'crudely', 'city', 'background', 'forgivable', 'almost', 'charming', 'flaw', 'considering', 'film', 'limited', 'budget', 'release', 'year', '1985.The', 'film', 'paradox', 'sorts', 'showcasing', 'interesting', 'performances', 'Rossellini', 'Hines', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'totally', 'under-appreciated', 'good', 'chemistry', 'impressionable', 'high-strung', 'duet', 'Darya', 'Raymond', 'Jerzy', 'Skolimovski', 'Colonel', 'Chaiko', 'classical', 'cunning', 'villain', 'Slavic', 'flare', 'Baryshnikov', 'bit', 'rigid', 'somewhat', 'formulaic', 'Nikolay', 'Rodchenko', 'when', 'not', 'dancing', 'course', 'when', 'imaginable', 'unimaginable', 'potential.Obviously', 'story', 'line', 'sketched', 'out', 'broad', 'exaggerated', 'strokes', 'bet', 'filmmakers', 'actually', 'expected', 'overall', 'theatricality', 'be', 'taken', 'grain', 'salt', 'subject', 'matter', 'discussed', 'was', ""n't"", 'keen', 'subtleties', 'events', 'depicted', 'were', 'behind-the-scenes', 'operations', 'right', 'were', 'blunt', 'theatrically', 'bizarre', 'can', 'be', 'who', 'think', 'circumstances', 'emotions', 'dissidence', 'emigration', 'defection', 'case', 'experience', 'are', 'overblown', 'brush', 'up', 'mid-20th', 'century', 'history', 'get', 'grip', 'things', 'Not', 'only', 'had', 'Big', 'Brother', 'machinery', 'state', 'control', 'suppression', 'been', 'well', 'oiled', 'decades', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'satellites', 'shadow', 'absurd', 'merciless', 'beast', 'hangs', 'many', 'nations', 'still', 'Folks', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'Nikolay', 'Rodchenko', 'merely', '_slightly_', 'glamorized', 'dramatized', 'version', 'real', 'life', 'experience', 'countless', 'victims', 'era.The', 'scenes', 'Nikolay', 'Darya', 'fleeing', 'deserted', 'streets', 'Leningrad', 'subsequent', 'humiliation', 'experience', 'front', 'American', 'embassy', 'send', 'down', 'spine', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', 'threat', 'danger', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'even', 'emigration', 'experience', '1990s', 'was', 'simply', 'peachy', 'retrospect', 'comparison', 'Just', 'disturbing', 'sobering', 'way', 'Rodchenko', 'reception', 'Americans', 'so-called', 'international', 'community', 'gates', 'nimble', 'exotic', 'specimen', 'Anyhow', 'let', 'dismount', 'high', 'horse', 'reiterate', 'seconding', 'earlier', 'reviews', 'quot', 'White', 'Nights', 'quot', 'features', 'superb', 'matchless', 'dancing', 'miss', 'deathly', 'sin', 'Well', 'almost', 'are', 'essentially', 'four', 'dance', 'highlights', 'movie', 'Choreography', 'mainly', 'Baryshnikov', 'Hines', 'very', 'importantly', 'Twyla', 'Tharp', 'Baryshnikov', 'duet', 'Florence', 'Faure', 'opening', 'credits', 'bound', 'leave', 'breathless', 'sheer', 'perfection', 'immensely', 'inventive', 'impeccably', 'executed', 'second', 'instance', 'when', ""'ll"", 'forget', 'could', 'blink', 'breathe', '11', 'rubles', '11', 'pirouettes', 'number', 'godly', 'effortlessness', 'Hines', 'Baryshnikov', 'dance', 'studio', 'number', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'then', 'Then', 'Mikhail', 'solo', 'Vysotsky', 'tape', 'stage', 'Kirov', 'theatre', 'beauty', 'literally', 'painful', 'words', 'can', 'never', 'describe', 'it.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'quot', 'White', 'Nights', 'quot', 'have', 'seen', 'only', 'once', ""'re"", 'denying', 'unearthly', 'pleasure', 'can', 'snicker', 'high-flown', 'sighs', 'exclamations', 'want']",N/A

He and his manager are on their way to Japan, and in Soviet air space, when the plane's cockpit catches on fire and they are forced to make an emergency landing at a Soviet military base. Kolya is, of course, captured by the KGB, and is held a prisoner, albeit in a gilded cage. The whole idea is that he will return to the Bolshoi and they will use him as a propaganda puppet. Of course he resists.Set to watch him is Raymond Greenwood (Gregory Hines) and his Russian wife Darya (Isabella Rossellini). Greenwood had deserted the US Army during the Vietnam War, and defected to the Soviet Union. So there is an odd sort of parallel to the two men's lives. Greenwood is also a dancer, a tap dancer. When we first see him, he is playing Sportin' Life in a Siberian production of ""Porgy & Bess.""One of the fascinating things about Baryshnikov in this film is that he dances real ballet in what appear to be running shoes. I'm guessing they were specially designed for this film, but it's quite disconcerting. It fuels the theory I have long had that Baryshnikov can do anything when it comes to dance. Or rather could in 1985; he's very nearly my age, after all.It's a spy story, but it's even more a story of friendship and ultimately, of trust. I suppose it's not much of a spoiler to say that Kolya escapes, but the details will give you quite a few surprises.Why four stars and not five? It drags a bit in places, especially when the focus is on the Soviet authorities.

Thurlow,"[4, 4]","1985's ""White Nights"" pairs legendary ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov and equally legendary tap dancer Gregory Hines in a pedestrian Cold War thriller most notable for the dance sequences and the music score.Russian defector and former Bolshoi dancer Nikolai Rodchenko (Baryshnikov essentially playing himself) ends up back in Soviet hands when his airliner makes an emergency landing in Leningrad.  Overjoyed Soviet officials insist he rejoin the Bolshoi, and park him with American defector Raymond Greenwood (Hines) and his pregnant Russian wife (a young Isabella Rossellini) while he recovers from a minor injury.  The KGB tasks Raymond with getting Nikolai ready to dance, but Nikolai is intent on escaping again.  An abortive attempt brings him in contact with his former ballet partner (superbly played by Helen Mirren), now a director of the Bolshoi but envious of Nikolai's recent artistic freedom.Nikolai eventually gains the assistance of both Raymond and his former partner in a scheme to escape; Raymond because he wishes to see his child grow up free, and his former partner because she does not wish to see Nikolai crushed by the Soviet system.  The hair-raising escape across Leningrad ends in a dead heat with the pursuing KGB just outside the U.S. Consulate, where tough choices have to be made.The undoubted highlight of the movie are three dance sequences. One features Baryshnikov's free interpretation of a traditional Russian ballet for his former partner.  A second features Raymond's thrilling tap dance to some American music he hasn't heard in years.  The third is a fascinating mixed dance sequence by Nikolai and Raymond.  The movie score includes the Oscar-winning tune ""Say You Say Me"" by Lionel Ritchie.This movie is well-recommended to fans of Baryshnikov and Hines who remember their prime as exceptional dancers.

Was not a blockbuster which was unfortunate.  The performances of Hines and Baryshnikov alone were worth seeing this movie.  It was interesting to see Gregory and Mishka dance in their own styles and then see them meld their styles of dance (ballet and tap) when they performed together.  The story was intense and kept me on the edge of my seat even though at had seen it before and knew the ending.The commentary on the making of White Nights was interesting.  I always wondered how they were able to film in Soviet Russia and how they were able to get Baryshnikov there and most importantly out again since he actually defected from the Soviet Union.

341499,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6302862949,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 8]","Seeing this 1985 movie (dubbed without irony by director Taylor Hackford as a ""political dance thriller"" in his DVD commentary) over twenty years later in a pristine new print reminds me exactly what I thought about it back then. That is that Hackford recruited two world-class dancers of completely different genres and then went about and contrived a far-fetched Cold War thriller story around them. It is really the unparalleled dancing that makes this film still watchable beginning with Mikhail Baryshnikov's extraordinary performance of Roland Petit's ballet, ""Le jeune homme et la mort"", opposite Florence Faure over the opening credits. His artful athleticism inevitably makes the rest of his acting feel rather pedestrian, as he unsurprisingly portrays Nikolai Rodchenko, a world-renowned Russian ballet dancer who has defected to the US after having been the leading performer of the Kirov Ballet.Written by James Goldman, the plot has his character on a Tokyo-bound airliner that's forced to land in Siberia where KGB authorities want to detain him in order to have him stay permanently in his homeland. To help matters along, Colonel Chaiko, the chief Soviet intelligence officer, decides to have Rodchenko live with Raymond Greenwood, a black American who has defected to the Soviet Union because the pervasive racism has not allowed his own artistic freedom. Gregory Hines acquits himself admirably with this impossible role, but more importantly, it simply provides him an excuse to dazzle with his own ""tap improvography"" (the actual verbiage used in the end credits) in a couple of spectacular tap numbers. The two masters even get to duet twice, and instead of looking incompatible, they are quite stunning as they mesh their divergent styles fluidly.The rest of the overly long story feels like an old episode of the 1960's TV series, ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" where Chaiko plots to convince Rodchenko to stay by reinstating him at the Kirov, which is now under the management of his abandoned lover, Gailna Ivanova. Trust issues arise between the former lovers, and yet another complicating element to his escape is Greenwood's Russian wife Darya who has not fully reconciled with her husband's U.S.-bred values and stays fearful at the possibility of leaving the Soviet Union. The events in the last quarter of the film consist of standard-issue spy thriller clich&eacute;s and it all ends in a quite unbelievable manner.Polish film director Jerzy Skomilowsky portrays Chaiko in an all-too-familiar dastardly manner. Playing Russian women, Isabella Rossellini (in her American film debut) and especially Helen Mirren are convincing, even if their decidedly secondary roles require little more than crying and expressing regrets. At certain moments and I'm sure they are quite intentional, Rossellini emits a glowing innocence similar to her mother Ingrid Bergman in her youth. The estimable Geraldine Page is wasted playing Rodchenko's agitated American manager. The soundtrack brings back nostalgic memories for me, even if the 1980's-style music makes the film feel as dated as the persistently gray images of pre-Gorbachev Russia.The new 2006 DVD includes a relatively insightful commentary track from Hackford and a nice twenty-minute looking-back featurette which includes remembrances from Hackford, Rossellini and Mirren and a brief tribute to Hines who died in 2003. The original theatrical trailer, a piece of 80's kitsch in itself, is also included as well as previews to unrelated dance-oriented films and DVDs.",3,Two Spectacular Performers Dance Around One Weak Cold War Thriller...Literally,1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,3543,"['Seeing', '1985', 'movie', 'dubbed', 'irony', 'director', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'political', 'dance', 'thriller', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'pristine', 'new', 'print', 'exactly', 'what', 'thought', 'back', 'then', 'Hackford', 'recruited', 'two', 'world-class', 'dancers', 'completely', 'different', 'genres', 'then', 'went', 'contrived', 'far-fetched', 'Cold', 'War', 'thriller', 'story', 'really', 'unparalleled', 'dancing', 'film', 'still', 'watchable', 'beginning', 'Mikhail', 'Baryshnikov', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'Roland', 'Petit', 'ballet', 'Le', 'jeune', 'homme', 'la', 'mort', 'opposite', 'Florence', 'Faure', 'opening', 'credits', 'artful', 'athleticism', 'inevitably', 'rest', 'acting', 'feel', 'rather', 'pedestrian', 'unsurprisingly', 'Nikolai', 'Rodchenko', 'world-renowned', 'Russian', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'who', 'defected', 'US', 'having', 'been', 'leading', 'performer', 'Kirov', 'Ballet.Written', 'James', 'Goldman', 'plot', 'character', 'Tokyo-bound', 'airliner', 'forced', 'land', 'Siberia', 'where', 'KGB', 'authorities', 'want', 'detain', 'order', 'have', 'stay', 'permanently', 'homeland', 'help', 'matters', 'Colonel', 'Chaiko', 'chief', 'Soviet', 'intelligence', 'officer', 'have', 'Rodchenko', 'live', 'Raymond', 'Greenwood', 'black', 'American', 'who', 'defected', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'pervasive', 'racism', 'not', 'allowed', 'own', 'artistic', 'freedom', 'Gregory', 'Hines', 'admirably', 'impossible', 'role', 'more', 'importantly', 'simply', 'excuse', 'dazzle', 'own', 'tap', 'improvography', 'actual', 'verbiage', 'used', 'end', 'credits', 'couple', 'spectacular', 'tap', 'numbers', 'two', 'masters', 'even', 'get', 'duet', 'twice', 'instead', 'looking', 'incompatible', 'are', 'quite', 'stunning', 'mesh', 'divergent', 'fluidly.The', 'rest', 'overly', 'long', 'story', 'feels', 'old', 'episode', '1960', 'TV', 'series', 'Man', 'U.N.C.L.E', 'where', 'Chaiko', 'convince', 'Rodchenko', 'stay', 'reinstating', 'Kirov', 'now', 'management', 'abandoned', 'lover', 'Gailna', 'Ivanova', 'Trust', 'issues', 'arise', 'former', 'lovers', 'yet', 'complicating', 'element', 'escape', 'Greenwood', 'Russian', 'wife', 'Darya', 'who', 'not', 'fully', 'reconciled', 'husband', 'U.S.-bred', 'values', 'stays', 'fearful', 'possibility', 'leaving', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'events', 'last', 'quarter', 'film', 'consist', 'standard-issue', 'spy', 'thriller', 'clich', 'eacute', 'quite', 'unbelievable', 'manner.Polish', 'film', 'director', 'Jerzy', 'Skomilowsky', 'Chaiko', 'all-too-familiar', 'dastardly', 'manner', 'Playing', 'Russian', 'women', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'American', 'film', 'debut', 'especially', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'are', 'convincing', 'even', 'decidedly', 'secondary', 'roles', 'require', 'little', 'more', 'crying', 'expressing', 'regrets', 'certain', 'moments', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'quite', 'intentional', 'Rossellini', 'glowing', 'innocence', 'similar', 'mother', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'youth', 'estimable', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'wasted', 'playing', 'Rodchenko', 'agitated', 'American', 'manager', 'soundtrack', 'back', 'nostalgic', 'memories', 'even', ""1980's-style"", 'music', 'film', 'feel', 'as', 'dated', 'persistently', 'gray', 'images', 'pre-Gorbachev', 'Russia.The', 'new', '2006', 'DVD', 'relatively', 'insightful', 'commentary', 'track', 'Hackford', 'nice', 'twenty-minute', 'looking-back', 'featurette', 'remembrances', 'Hackford', 'Rossellini', 'Mirren', 'brief', 'tribute', 'Hines', 'who', 'died', '2003', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'piece', '80', 'kitsch', 'also', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'previews', 'unrelated', 'dance-oriented', 'films', 'DVDs']",N/A

341520,ANUBY6KOT60WH,6302862949,R. Galeano Valencia,"[13, 15]","Taylor Hackford's ""White Nights"" is definitely one of my favorite movies ever. I signed up like two years ago to be notified of the release of this movie on DVD and bought it right away when it became available on Amazon. Nikolai Rodchenko (Mikhail Baryshnikov) is a young and somewhat spoiled Russian ballet legend whose multiple successes in his motherland couldn't match his need for freedom and a life outside the unbearable perennial watch of the Soviet communist regime. So he chooses to defect to the United States where he becomes a major celebrity at the height of the Cold War tensions between the two countries. When traveling from London to Tokyo for a series of presentations, Rodchenko's plane malfunctions and is forced to perform an emergency landing on Russian soil. Nikolai will eventually be caught by the KGB and taken secretly back to Leningrad despite protests from the West. Being as he is, a glory of the Russian ballet, Rodchenko is forced to stay in the URSS and to resume his life as usual. He is put under strict surveillance by the KGB and assigned an accompanying couple, the Greenwood's, who are supposed to inform Rodchenko's whereabouts 24/7 to the soviet intelligence. Raymond Greenwood (Gregory Hines) is an African American tap dancer who tired of living a life of struggle for social and economic betterment in the U.S., voluntarily chose to very publicly ""defect"" to the URSS in opposition to the War in Vietnam. However flashy his ""defection"" was -and utterly publicized by the Russians- years have passed and Raymond is now just limited to small performances in little towns around Siberia, still living the life of an underprivileged man, but in the URSS. He married Darya (Isabella Rossellini), a Russian girl who loves him adoringly but who also, to much of her dismay, sometimes cannot hold up against Raymond's frustrations and personal demons. Interaction between Nikolai and Raymond becomes the main subject of the film and Nikolai will make Raymond realize how limited and hopeless life is in the URSS and eventually the three of them will seek a way to return to the United States. The film shows beautiful moving scenes such as the one where a drunk Raymond opens himself up to Nilokai in a heartfelt tap-dance-backed-up monologue, giving an impressively moving and honest performance. It shocks me everytime I watch it. Or my other favorite dancing scene, where Nilokai meets his former lover Galina Ivanova (Helen Mirren) at the stage of the Kirov Theater. Galina has now become a prominent figure of the Soviet Ballet nomenklatur. Together they will reminish about past love and life, and dancing to the passionate lyrics of Vladimir Vysotsky a famous Russian protest poet-singer, Nikolai will desperately and hopelessly try to explain her (and perhaps once more, also to himself) why he had to leave his whole life behind. In the process, he will also try to ease the inner pain of longing for his roots, history and identity. Dancing sequences performed by Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gregory Hines (both solos and as an ensemble) are incredibly moving and beautiful. Choreographies are Baryshnikov's, Hines's and even there is an incredibly moving opening segment choreographed by Twayla Tharp ""The young man and the death"" performed by Baryshnikov himself and Florence Faure who will leave you speechless. The music is great (I particularly remember the sticky rhythmic beat of ""My love is chemical"" by Lou Reed). Despite the obvious age that the picture shows ""White Nights"" is a beautiful movie, with spectacular dancing sequences, definitely worth watching. Personally to me it is certainly a pity that the whole story is still as appealing as it was twenty years ago. Forced migration was certainly an issue back then in 1985 as it continues to be today. Still in 2007 there are people who are virtually obligated to migrate from their own countries when civil liberties are not in force or about to perish. Just turn your head and watch the horrific example of Cuban ""balseros"", people who prefer to risk their lives in shark-infected waters seeking the coast of Florida instead of living a freedomless life of craving and need under the communist regime of Fidel Castro. So yes, in a time of a suppousedly ""end of ideologies"", ""White Nights"" is a movie that has a well established political posture and yet is also undeniably interesting and moving to watch and enjoy time and time again.",5,The endless night...,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,4447,"['Taylor', 'Hackford', 'White', 'Nights', 'definitely', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'ever', 'signed', 'up', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'be', 'notified', 'release', 'movie', 'DVD', 'bought', 'right', 'away', 'when', 'became', 'available', 'Amazon', 'Nikolai', 'Rodchenko', 'Mikhail', 'Baryshnikov', 'young', 'somewhat', 'spoiled', 'Russian', 'ballet', 'legend', 'multiple', 'successes', 'motherland', 'could', ""n't"", 'match', 'need', 'freedom', 'life', 'unbearable', 'perennial', 'watch', 'Soviet', 'communist', 'regime', 'defect', 'United', 'States', 'where', 'major', 'celebrity', 'height', 'Cold', 'War', 'tensions', 'two', 'countries', 'When', 'traveling', 'London', 'Tokyo', 'series', 'presentations', 'Rodchenko', 'plane', 'malfunctions', 'forced', 'perform', 'emergency', 'landing', 'Russian', 'soil', 'Nikolai', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'caught', 'KGB', 'taken', 'secretly', 'back', 'Leningrad', 'protests', 'West', 'Being', 'glory', 'Russian', 'ballet', 'Rodchenko', 'forced', 'stay', 'URSS', 'resume', 'life', 'usual', 'put', 'strict', 'surveillance', 'KGB', 'assigned', 'accompanying', 'couple', 'Greenwood', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'inform', 'Rodchenko', 'whereabouts', '24/7', 'soviet', 'intelligence', 'Raymond', 'Greenwood', 'Gregory', 'Hines', 'African', 'American', 'tap', 'dancer', 'who', 'tired', 'living', 'life', 'struggle', 'social', 'economic', 'betterment', 'U.S.', 'voluntarily', 'chose', 'very', 'publicly', 'defect', 'URSS', 'opposition', 'War', 'Vietnam', 'However', 'flashy', 'defection', 'was', '-and', 'utterly', 'publicized', 'Russians-', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'Raymond', 'now', 'just', 'limited', 'small', 'performances', 'little', 'towns', 'Siberia', 'still', 'living', 'life', 'underprivileged', 'man', 'URSS', 'married', 'Darya', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'Russian', 'girl', 'who', 'adoringly', 'who', 'also', 'much', 'dismay', 'sometimes', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'Raymond', 'frustrations', 'personal', 'demons', 'Interaction', 'Nikolai', 'Raymond', 'main', 'subject', 'film', 'Nikolai', 'will', 'make', 'Raymond', 'realize', 'how', 'limited', 'hopeless', 'life', 'URSS', 'eventually', 'three', 'will', 'seek', 'way', 'return', 'United', 'States', 'film', 'beautiful', 'moving', 'scenes', 'such', 'one', 'where', 'drunk', 'Raymond', 'Nilokai', 'heartfelt', 'tap-dance-backed-up', 'monologue', 'giving', 'impressively', 'moving', 'honest', 'performance', 'everytime', 'watch', 'other', 'favorite', 'dancing', 'scene', 'where', 'Nilokai', 'former', 'lover', 'Galina', 'Ivanova', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'stage', 'Kirov', 'Theater', 'Galina', 'now', 'become', 'prominent', 'figure', 'Soviet', 'Ballet', 'nomenklatur', 'will', 'reminish', 'past', 'love', 'life', 'dancing', 'passionate', 'lyrics', 'Vladimir', 'Vysotsky', 'famous', 'Russian', 'protest', 'poet-singer', 'Nikolai', 'will', 'desperately', 'hopelessly', 'try', 'explain', 'perhaps', 'once', 'more', 'also', 'why', 'had', 'leave', 'whole', 'life', 'process', 'will', 'also', 'try', 'ease', 'inner', 'pain', 'longing', 'roots', 'history', 'identity', 'Dancing', 'sequences', 'performed', 'Mikhail', 'Baryshnikov', 'Gregory', 'Hines', 'solos', 'ensemble', 'are', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'beautiful', 'Choreographies', 'are', 'Baryshnikov', 'Hines', 'even', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'opening', 'segment', 'choreographed', 'Twayla', 'Tharp', 'young', 'man', 'death', 'performed', 'Baryshnikov', 'Florence', 'Faure', 'who', 'will', 'leave', 'speechless', 'music', 'great', 'particularly', 'remember', 'sticky', 'rhythmic', 'beat', 'love', 'chemical', 'Lou', 'Reed', 'obvious', 'age', 'picture', 'White', 'Nights', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'dancing', 'sequences', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'Personally', 'certainly', 'pity', 'whole', 'story', 'still', 'as', 'appealing', 'was', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'Forced', 'migration', 'was', 'certainly', 'issue', 'back', 'then', '1985', 'be', 'today', 'Still', '2007', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'virtually', 'obligated', 'migrate', 'own', 'countries', 'when', 'civil', 'liberties', 'are', 'not', 'force', 'perish', 'Just', 'turn', 'head', 'watch', 'horrific', 'example', 'Cuban', 'balseros', 'people', 'who', 'prefer', 'risk', 'lives', 'shark-infected', 'waters', 'seeking', 'coast', 'Florida', 'instead', 'living', 'freedomless', 'life', 'craving', 'need', 'communist', 'regime', 'Fidel', 'Castro', 'So', 'yes', 'time', 'suppousedly', 'end', 'ideologies', 'White', 'Nights', 'movie', 'well', 'established', 'political', 'posture', 'yet', 'also', 'undeniably', 'interesting', 'moving', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'time', 'time', 'again']",N/A
