I expected George Burns playing both God and the Devil would be interesating...It's Hell to swallow!A young boy's father is asked GOD to watch over him...God says I hope he (the boy) isn't another disappointment (Foreshadowing what going to happen to the max)The boy grows up into Ted Wass character, Billy Shelton-a Struggling musician who career is floundering and says ""I would sell my very soul to the devil to make it"". (Can you say WRONG ANSWER!)He is visited by Harry Tophet (the devil) and made an offer he can't refuse. He signed the satin pact. Shelton  takes over Billy Wayne, a rock star the devil recently just took his soulShelton sees his wife with another man. He finds out she is pregnant  and wants to get out of the contract. The Devil says NO (cmon there would be no movie is he said yes). So Shelton keeps search for GODA holy man says GOD is in the desert. Where else would a rock star go to the desert...Las Vegas. This is where GOD and the Devil having a showdown playing poker. A rotoscoping nightmare since one or the other Burns look like he's taped.I would have wanted more interplay between God and the Devil(THE SHOWDOWN WAS TOO SHORT)instead of a FAUST-like tale.It is a cute film, like too much sweet candy after HalloweenIf you are a George Burns fan, its OKAY--I'd rather watch ""Going in Style"" with Burns and Art CarneyBennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD",2,Heaven Help Us,1147737600,"05 16, 2006",2006,1465,"['Ok', 'like', 'George', 'Burns', 'first', 'Oh', 'God', 'film', 'Oh', 'God', 'Two', 'was', 'lumpy', 'weak', 'sequel', 'expected', 'George', 'Burns', 'playing', 'God', 'Devil', 'would', 'be', 'interesating', 'Hell', 'swallow', 'young', 'boy', 'father', 'asked', 'GOD', 'watch', 'God', 'hope', 'boy', ""n't"", 'disappointment', 'Foreshadowing', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'max', 'boy', 'up', 'Ted', 'Wass', 'character', 'Billy', 'Shelton-a', 'Struggling', 'musician', 'who', 'career', 'floundering', 'would', 'sell', 'very', 'soul', 'devil', 'make', 'Can', 'say', 'WRONG', 'ANSWER', 'visited', 'Harry', 'Tophet', 'devil', 'made', 'offer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'signed', 'satin', 'pact', 'Shelton', 'over', 'Billy', 'Wayne', 'rock', 'star', 'devil', 'recently', 'just', 'took', 'soulShelton', 'wife', 'man', 'out', 'pregnant', 'get', 'contract', 'Devil', 'NO', 'cmon', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'said', 'yes', 'Shelton', 'search', 'GODA', 'holy', 'man', 'GOD', 'desert', 'Where', 'else', 'would', 'rock', 'star', 'go', 'desert', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'where', 'GOD', 'Devil', 'having', 'showdown', 'playing', 'poker', 'rotoscoping', 'nightmare', 'one', 'other', 'Burns', 'look', 'taped.I', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'more', 'interplay', 'God', 'Devil', 'THE', 'SHOWDOWN', 'WAS', 'TOO', 'SHORT', 'instead', 'FAUST-like', 'tale.It', 'cute', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'sweet', 'candy', 'HalloweenIf', 'are', 'George', 'Burns', 'fan', 'OKAY', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'Going', 'Style', 'Burns', 'Art', 'CarneyBennet', 'Pomerantz', 'AUDIOWORLD']",N/A

As I mentioned in reviews for the other movies in the Oh God series, this movie is not at all sacrilegious nor blasphemous. In fact, it is the opposite. The movie will have you crying at the end, but it will be happy tears. Like the other Oh God movies, &#34;Oh God! You Devil&#34; carries a strong message. Perhaps the strongest of all of them.
