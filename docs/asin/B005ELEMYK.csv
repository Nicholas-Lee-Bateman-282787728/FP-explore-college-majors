There are some gory death scenes, particularly in the third act, but a lot of them are done in slow motion and look stupid. Bigfoot also has a smooth chest, so apparantly he's metrosexual. And the woman who gave birth to Bigfoot's child (?) got on my nerves with her incoherant babbling. Unless you're a Bigfoot completist, there's really no need for you to buy this.",2,"Gore, And Nothing More",1319500800,"10 25, 2011",2011,465,"['Night', 'Demon', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Bigfoot', 'movie', 'expected', 'be', 'fun', 'mostly', 'dull', 'are', 'gory', 'death', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'third', 'act', 'lot', 'are', 'done', 'slow', 'motion', 'look', 'stupid', 'Bigfoot', 'also', 'smooth', 'chest', 'so', 'apparantly', 'metrosexual', 'woman', 'who', 'gave', 'birth', 'Bigfoot', 'child', 'got', 'nerves', 'incoherant', 'babbling', ""'re"", 'Bigfoot', 'completist', 'really', 'need', 'buy']",N/A
1456627,A2RST4Y2LXRQW5,B005ELEMYK,Avery Hemming,"[6, 9]","This movie is very entertaining for me to watch.  The story is good even though the acting will not win them an Oscar.  The gore is good, but not grotesque.  Bigfoot is not a nice creature.  He doesn't care if you're trying to take a nap in a sleeping bag or if you really gotta take a leak in the woods.  You'll just have to watch for yourself how Bigfoot handles the situation.  Once you see what Bigfoot looks like, it's funny.  It reminds me of the Six Million Dollar Man's Bigfoot combined with the late 70's television show of the Incredible Hulk with Lou Ferrigno.  The costume does not cover the guys chest very well and he will make you think that this Bigfoot could have been the villain on the Incredible Hulk television show.  I liked the story and how it evolved.  I don't think the director or writer were trying to be funny, it was unintentional; and that's what made this movie enjoyable for me.  The sound effects were effective for the movie.  I liked the horror sounds when Bigfoot arrives to attack and then I also laugh at the excessive growls of Bigfoot.  When I first discovered this movie, I thought the title for this Bigfoot movie was wrong.  Once you watch the movie, you'll find out why the movie was called, ""Night of the Demon,"" even though I still think the movie should have been called something else.""Night of the Demon"" has been restored as best as possible.  The picture looks much better than the bootlegs floating around.  It would be nice to have this movie in widescreen, but it still looks good in the 1:33 aspect ratio.  The sound is good and you can hear the dialogue just fine ever though there's a background noise.You get three trailer previews of three movies:  ""Killpoint;"" ""Lowblow;"" and ""The Hearse.""  I've seen ""The Hearse"" and I liked the movie. I haven't seen ""Killpoint"" or ""Lowblow"" and both of them looks like it be a fun action movie to watch.  I hope Code Red releases all three of the movies.There's an option to watch ""Night Of The Demon"" without Maria Kanellis.  I watched the movie with Maria Kanellis appearing at the beginning and at the end of the movie.  I liked her sense of humor and I want Code Red to continue with Maria.  As for Maria's ""Fantasy"" music video, the music is not my style and I could pass on that.Last, the dvd I bought has a reversible art cover.  I like having the front side of Maria and the reversible cover of the ""leaking victim"" made me laugh!  I loved it and I'm going to buy another copy of this movie so I could also display the irreversivle dvd cover.If you don't like Rhonda Shear or Elvira hosting a movie, you can watch this movie without Maria's input.  If most of your movie collection consists of a million dollar budget with well renowned actors, you won't spend a penny on this movie.  If you're expecting to be terrified with an engrossing storyline, you're better off reading the newspaper.  The gore factor will be a disappointment if you're expecting zombie type gore.I'm not an expert on this movie, but I didn't notice any scene being cut.  I think you'll be watching the full version of this movie.  This is my favorite Bigfoot movie and I never get tired of watching this movie.  I think Code Red did a good job of restoring ""Night of the Demon.""  I hope Code Red continues to release their movies with reversible art covers and I like having Maria on board.",4,Did Bigfoot shave his chest hair?,1319241600,"10 22, 2011",2011,3370,"['movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'story', 'good', 'even', 'acting', 'will', 'not', 'win', 'Oscar', 'gore', 'good', 'not', 'grotesque', 'Bigfoot', 'not', 'nice', 'creature', ""n't"", 'care', ""'re"", 'trying', 'take', 'nap', 'sleeping', 'bag', 'really', 'got', 'ta', 'take', 'leak', 'woods', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'how', 'Bigfoot', 'situation', 'Once', 'see', 'what', 'Bigfoot', 'funny', 'Six', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'Bigfoot', 'combined', 'late', '70', 'television', 'show', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'costume', 'not', 'cover', 'guys', 'chest', 'very', 'well', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'Bigfoot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'villain', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'television', 'show', 'liked', 'story', 'how', 'evolved', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'director', 'writer', 'were', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'was', 'unintentional', 'what', 'made', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'sound', 'effects', 'were', 'effective', 'movie', 'liked', 'horror', 'when', 'Bigfoot', 'attack', 'then', 'also', 'laugh', 'excessive', 'growls', 'Bigfoot', 'When', 'first', 'discovered', 'movie', 'thought', 'title', 'Bigfoot', 'movie', 'was', 'wrong', 'Once', 'watch', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'called', 'Night', 'Demon', 'even', 'still', 'think', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'something', 'else', 'Night', 'Demon', 'been', 'restored', 'as', 'best', 'possible', 'picture', 'much', 'better', 'bootlegs', 'floating', 'around', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'movie', 'widescreen', 'still', 'good', '1:33', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'sound', 'good', 'can', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'just', 'fine', 'ever', 'background', 'noise.You', 'get', 'three', 'trailer', 'previews', 'three', 'movies', 'Killpoint', 'Lowblow', 'Hearse', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Hearse', 'liked', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Killpoint', 'Lowblow', 'be', 'fun', 'action', 'movie', 'watch', 'hope', 'Code', 'Red', 'three', 'movies.There', 'option', 'watch', 'Night', 'Demon', 'Maria', 'Kanellis', 'watched', 'movie', 'Maria', 'Kanellis', 'appearing', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'liked', 'sense', 'humor', 'want', 'Code', 'Red', 'continue', 'Maria', 'Maria', 'Fantasy', 'music', 'video', 'music', 'not', 'style', 'could', 'pass', 'that.Last', 'dvd', 'bought', 'reversible', 'art', 'cover', 'having', 'front', 'side', 'Maria', 'reversible', 'cover', 'leaking', 'victim', 'made', 'loved', ""'m"", 'going', 'buy', 'copy', 'movie', 'could', 'also', 'display', 'irreversivle', 'dvd', 'cover.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Rhonda', 'Shear', 'Elvira', 'hosting', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'Maria', 'input', 'most', 'movie', 'collection', 'million', 'dollar', 'budget', 'well', 'renowned', 'actors', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spend', 'penny', 'movie', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'be', 'terrified', 'engrossing', 'storyline', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'reading', 'newspaper', 'gore', 'factor', 'will', 'be', 'disappointment', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'zombie', 'type', 'gore.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'expert', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'scene', 'being', 'cut', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'full', 'version', 'movie', 'favorite', 'Bigfoot', 'movie', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'watching', 'movie', 'think', 'Code', 'Red', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'restoring', 'Night', 'Demon', 'hope', 'Code', 'Red', 'release', 'movies', 'reversible', 'art', 'covers', 'like', 'having', 'Maria', 'board']",N/A
1456628,AVJZQ6YNFUK92,B005ELEMYK,Grindhouse and Horror,"[1, 1]","I saw this rare film on VHS decades ago for the first time and have been waiting for a DVD release.  There's a message about the quality before the film starts and the quality isn't great, but it still looks good. It looks so much better than my worn out VHS tape that I haven't watched in over 10 years; I didn't have that many complaints about the quality. It won't appeal to everyone, but I think it's a lot of fun and the gore is well done.  Some of the kills are also extremely graphic and also pretty creative.  The double girl scout killing is worth mentioning, and the climax of the film when bigfoot goes bonkers and slaughters everyone is classic.  The whole film has that grindhouse type charm that I like, and it also has a high amount of replay value because it's one of my most watched films in my DVD collection; but I should mention that this may not be true for some people who prefer to watch a lot of mainstream horror films because this flick is geared more towards fans of 70s and 80s grindhouse stuff. Some good atmosphere, nice forest locations, a simple story and a good body count make this a fun film. Most of the film takes place in and around the forest, and there's some nudity; although there's no full frontal nudity. I thought most of the film moves at a good pace, and the film basically will appeal to many fans of slasher films and monster flicks because the demon (it's actually bigfoot) kind of acts like both. I thought it was great, but it might not appeal to many mainstream horror fans.The DVD has no chapter stops. The quality is from a VHS master.

Curiously, after looking up the VHS, bootleg DVD, and this ""official"" DVD...all three versions seem to have a differently listed running time. Maria's B-Movie Mayhem seems to have the shortest of the run times I've seen @ 90 minutes....that's the difficult thing about these ""genre"" films, often they are released multiple times with each version adding (or censoring/cutting) various parts of the film.

Thomas ""rhthomas""","[8, 11]","I've heard of this film for years, due to its notoriety as a video nasty and the fact that copies were not easy to find, and I had read about the most infamous scene involving a biker, so this film has always stayed with me as a title I'd like to eventually see.Now, thanks to Code Red, I have seen this film and it has more than lived up to my expectations. Be careful with some reviews here and elsewhere, as they have spoilers, and believe me, the less you know about this film, the better, however, there are some spoilers towards the end if you want them...The source is a 1 Inch master tape, not a film print, since none could be found, and the artwork is not of the original movie poster, since this film was so low budget it didn't have a poster (it probably played third bill at the drive in circuit anyway, and didn't need one). The image is full screen, but since the film was shot 16mm and blown up to 35mm, you are actually not losing any of the picture as with many full screen presentations, and the quality is decent.The music is a minimalist moog score, and reminds me of the music in another film made around the same time called ""Burial Ground"", and the lack of a distinct theme (this isn't a Carpenter/Howarth score) lends to the surreal proceedings - believe me, this is an insane Bigfoot movie, and had me surprised at every turn.Unlike other Bigfoot films made in the 70s, you do get a good look at the costume, and considering the low budget, it's not too bad.I enjoyed this film so much that I've watched it twice so far, and will probably watch it a third time in the next week or so. I'd much rather watch a film like this than most multi-plex garbage littering movie screens across the country.As the clich&eacute; goes, `they don't make `em like they used to', but thanks to companies like Code Red, films like this are getting unearthed for all to see.Keep `em coming...***SPOILERS***This was one of a few R-rated films released by the adult film company VCX, and when the bigfoot spies on the couple having sex in the van and pulls the man out and kills him, the woman sees his body falling across the window and her cries/screams sound very orgasmic. I'm convinced this was an in-joke by the filmmakers.There's debate whether or not some of the outrageous scenes were intended to be funny (many people today view older films with contempt and derision and think everybody making movies back then were clueless idiots), but picture yourself on the set when the biker was castrated, the two girl scouts were stabbed to death by their own hands (with a little help from the Bigfoot), or Bigfoot swinging someone's intestines as a lasso, and ask yourself if you would be stifling laughter.
