370823,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,6303366511,Andrew McCaffrey,"[3, 8]","OUR HOSPITALITY is an amusing little film.  Buster Keaton is a New York gentleman returning to his family's ancestral seat in order to collect an inheritance.  However, he falls afoul of an old rivalry; his new neighbors have vowed to kill all remaining McKays (they themselves are, of course, the Canfields), and Buster appearing in the town has given them opportunity of ridding the world of the last member of the family.  Oblivious as ever to the danger he is in, Keaton ends up falling for the daughter of the house.  He has a temporary reprieve during his courtship -- the Canfields won't kill a man while he's enjoying their Southern hospitality.  In other words, while he stands in their house, he's safe; if he puts a foot out of the front door, he's a dead man.  Catching on to the situation, Keaton goes to extraordinary lengths to avoid exiting their abode.Any summary of OUR HOSPITALITY makes it sound like a one-joke movie, but that would be a misleading impression, as there are lots of quick little sight-gags and set-pieces that make up this film.  Keaton's journey from his New York home to the Deep South of Trenton, New Jersey is a surreal voyage on a ramshackle train that travels as well on its tracks as it does on a dirt road.  He faces a variety of physical obstacles, the most famous being his rescue of a woman in midair as she falls over the lip of a waterfall.  Okay, so he's actually rescuing a prop rather than a real person, but the stunt is still quite impressive: Keaton with a rope around his waist swings from above the waterfall straight down into the downpour, plucks the doll from air, swings back towards a rocky outcrop and delivers it to safety.Keaton testing the limits of the Canfield hospitality (figuratively and literally) is quite a treat.  Joe Roberts, a regular in these Keaton films, makes a welcome addition to the cast playing a sort of demented Colonel Sanders.  The chase scenes (a staple of any good Buster Keaton film) are fast and well executed.Also included on this disc is SHERLOCK, JR.  Sherlock Jr. is the name that Buster Keaton's character goes by in his dreams.  By day, he's a rather put-upon projectionist at a cinema.  But he yearns for a more exciting life.  He reads books on becoming a private detective and even has a magnifying glass and a false mustache for his undercover work.  However, he's quickly accused of a crime that he didn't committed, and, having lost the affections of his beloved, is soon stuck back at work with nothing to do but change reels and sleep.  While napping, he dreams, and places himself inside the story of the rather dull-looking melodrama that is playing in front of him.The first thought that strikes me about the dream sequences of SHERLOCK, JR. is that they have a very 60s feel to it, which just goes to show you how ahead of his time Keaton was.  At first Buster just walks through the screen to interact with the action.  But the scenes change quickly, and he remains in the center of the picture.  It's a neat metaphor for the way Buster Keaton character always seemed to stay calm and collected regardless of the madness of the world around him.  But you could imagine these camera tricks being done in a student film, although they'd probably be much less inspired.The film then moves on from its surreal scene/camera changing jump cuts, and Keaton begins to interact with the movie and its characters directly.  This is where the movie really feels like a 60s production.  It's a James Bond spoof, nearly forty years before the premier of DR. NO!  It's uncanny.  We have exploding billiard balls, booby-trapped chairs, a damsel in distress, motorcycle and car chases, and a suave, sophisticated hero.  I thought myself extremely clever for noticing this... until the orchestra suddenly burst into a snatch of the James Bond theme at the moment when Buster Keaton's car turns itself into a boat.  These Kino Video releases usually claim to have used the original score performed by a modern orchestra.  Obviously, the score here isn't from the original, but it certainly made me laugh at that point.You can see the filmmakers (mostly Keaton, I assume) really letting loose and experimenting.  One of the movie's most notable features is the film within a film, where Keaton takes great pains to point out that his character is dreaming the action.  It's interesting to view in comparison to the way movies have since developed; a modern audience would have had no trouble picking up on the clues, but Keaton couldn't rely on his viewers having enough familiarity with the medium.  The clues that audiences today notice without even thinking about were still being developed at this time.I wasn't overly wild about the two films on this disc, although they are still a hell of a lot of fun.  Upon reflection, I think I prefer Buster Keaton's faster paced short films, which isn't to say that there aren't some great gags here.  SHERLOCK JR. seems to be the better regarded of the two, and I'll agree with conventional wisdom on that one.",3,Our Sherlock,1074902400,"01 24, 2004",2004,5049,"['OUR', 'HOSPITALITY', 'amusing', 'little', 'film', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'New', 'York', 'gentleman', 'returning', 'family', 'ancestral', 'seat', 'order', 'collect', 'inheritance', 'However', 'afoul', 'old', 'rivalry', 'new', 'neighbors', 'have', 'vowed', 'kill', 'remaining', 'McKays', 'are', 'course', 'Canfields', 'Buster', 'appearing', 'town', 'given', 'opportunity', 'ridding', 'world', 'last', 'member', 'family', 'ever', 'danger', 'Keaton', 'up', 'falling', 'daughter', 'house', 'temporary', 'reprieve', 'courtship', 'Canfields', 'wo', ""n't"", 'kill', 'man', 'enjoying', 'Southern', 'hospitality', 'other', 'words', 'house', 'safe', 'foot', 'front', 'door', 'dead', 'man', 'Catching', 'situation', 'Keaton', 'extraordinary', 'lengths', 'avoid', 'exiting', 'abode.Any', 'summary', 'OUR', 'HOSPITALITY', 'one-joke', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'misleading', 'impression', 'are', 'lots', 'quick', 'little', 'sight-gags', 'set-pieces', 'make', 'up', 'film', 'Keaton', 'journey', 'New', 'York', 'home', 'Deep', 'South', 'Trenton', 'New', 'Jersey', 'surreal', 'voyage', 'ramshackle', 'train', 'as', 'well', 'tracks', 'dirt', 'road', 'variety', 'physical', 'obstacles', 'most', 'famous', 'being', 'rescue', 'woman', 'midair', 'lip', 'waterfall', 'Okay', 'actually', 'rescuing', 'prop', 'rather', 'real', 'person', 'stunt', 'still', 'quite', 'impressive', 'Keaton', 'rope', 'waist', 'swings', 'waterfall', 'straight', 'down', 'downpour', 'doll', 'air', 'swings', 'back', 'rocky', 'outcrop', 'delivers', 'safety.Keaton', 'testing', 'limits', 'Canfield', 'hospitality', 'figuratively', 'literally', 'quite', 'treat', 'Joe', 'Roberts', 'regular', 'Keaton', 'films', 'welcome', 'addition', 'cast', 'playing', 'sort', 'demented', 'Colonel', 'Sanders', 'chase', 'scenes', 'staple', 'good', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'film', 'are', 'fast', 'well', 'executed.Also', 'included', 'disc', 'SHERLOCK', 'JR.', 'Sherlock', 'Jr.', 'name', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'character', 'dreams', 'day', 'rather', 'put-upon', 'projectionist', 'cinema', 'more', 'exciting', 'life', 'books', 'becoming', 'private', 'detective', 'even', 'magnifying', 'glass', 'false', 'mustache', 'undercover', 'work', 'However', 'quickly', 'accused', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'committed', 'having', 'lost', 'affections', 'beloved', 'soon', 'stuck', 'back', 'work', 'nothing', 'do', 'change', 'reels', 'sleep', 'napping', 'places', 'story', 'rather', 'dull-looking', 'melodrama', 'playing', 'front', 'him.The', 'first', 'thought', 'strikes', 'dream', 'sequences', 'SHERLOCK', 'JR.', 'have', 'very', '60s', 'feel', 'just', 'show', 'how', 'ahead', 'time', 'Keaton', 'was', 'first', 'Buster', 'just', 'screen', 'interact', 'action', 'scenes', 'change', 'quickly', 'center', 'picture', 'neat', 'metaphor', 'way', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'character', 'always', 'seemed', 'stay', 'calm', 'collected', 'regardless', 'madness', 'world', 'could', 'imagine', 'camera', 'tricks', 'being', 'done', 'student', 'film', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'much', 'less', 'inspired.The', 'film', 'then', 'surreal', 'scene/camera', 'changing', 'jump', 'cuts', 'Keaton', 'interact', 'movie', 'characters', 'directly', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'feels', '60s', 'production', 'James', 'Bond', 'spoof', 'nearly', 'forty', 'years', 'premier', 'DR.', 'NO', 'uncanny', 'have', 'exploding', 'billiard', 'balls', 'booby-trapped', 'chairs', 'damsel', 'distress', 'motorcycle', 'car', 'chases', 'suave', 'sophisticated', 'hero', 'thought', 'extremely', 'clever', 'noticing', 'orchestra', 'suddenly', 'burst', 'snatch', 'James', 'Bond', 'theme', 'moment', 'when', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'car', 'boat', 'Kino', 'Video', 'usually', 'claim', 'have', 'used', 'original', 'score', 'performed', 'modern', 'orchestra', 'Obviously', 'score', 'here', ""n't"", 'original', 'certainly', 'made', 'laugh', 'point.You', 'can', 'see', 'filmmakers', 'mostly', 'Keaton', 'assume', 'really', 'letting', 'loose', 'experimenting', 'One', 'movie', 'most', 'notable', 'features', 'film', 'film', 'where', 'Keaton', 'great', 'pains', 'point', 'out', 'character', 'dreaming', 'action', 'interesting', 'view', 'comparison', 'way', 'movies', 'have', 'developed', 'modern', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'trouble', 'picking', 'up', 'clues', 'Keaton', 'could', ""n't"", 'rely', 'viewers', 'having', 'enough', 'familiarity', 'medium', 'clues', 'audiences', 'today', 'notice', 'even', 'thinking', 'were', 'still', 'being', 'developed', 'time.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'overly', 'wild', 'two', 'films', 'disc', 'are', 'still', 'hell', 'lot', 'fun', 'reflection', 'think', 'prefer', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'faster', 'paced', 'short', 'films', ""n't"", 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'gags', 'here', 'SHERLOCK', 'JR.', 'be', 'better', 'regarded', 'two', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'one']",N/A
370824,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6303366511,calvinnme,"[1, 1]","These two films were made sequentially - ""Our Hospitality"" in late 1923, and ""Sherlock Jr."" in early 1924.""Our Hospitality"" was Keaton's second feature film after he went from making two-reel (20 minute) short films to feature films in 1923. It is a comic take-off on the Hatfield and McCoy feud of the 1880's, but here Keaton takes you back to 1830, primarily so he can introduce the main mechanical gag of the film, - a mechanically-accurate faithful re-creation of the early locomotive - Stephenson's Rocket. The train moves so slowly that Keaton's dog runs alongside the train and has no trouble keeping up. The jist of the story is that Keaton plays Willie McKay, the surviving McKay after the McKay/Canfield feud of roughly twenty years before. Willie travels to his ancestral home in Appalachia to inspect some property he's inherited, and on the journey there begins to fall for the young lady with whom he is traveling. She turns out to be a Canfield, and when her brothers find out that a McKay is in town they go for their guns. However, the patriarch of the family (Big Joe Roberts) warns his sons that it is against their code of hospitality to shoot someone inside of their house. Willie, who has been invited to dinner, learns of all of this and does his best to not leave the house.The other feature, Sherlock Jr., is only 45 minutes long. It actually failed when it was released, but today it is considered ground-breaking. Keaton performs some stunts such as appearing to jump through a woman backed up against a fence that remained a secret for years. He also, at the beginning of the film, jumps into a motion picture that is running in the theatre where he works as a projectionist. Once on the movie screen, Keaton has to adjust his strategy as the scene changes from the front steps of a house, to the edge of a cliff, to a lion's den.The presence of interesting film tricks doesn't mean the absence of a plot though. The film is about a boy (Keaton) who dreams of being a great detective. The girl he pursues is also sought after by a dishonest employee of her father's who frames Keaton's character for a theft. As a result he is ordered to never to return to the girl's home again. The boy goes back to his job as a projectionist, falls asleep, and dreams of being a great detective - Sherlock Jr.If you're unfamiliar with Keaton's work, this is a good place to start. These DVDs were released when DVD technology was relatively new, so the pictures are not as crisp as perhaps they could be. However, the video quality is still quite good. My main complaint would be that Kino didn't put any kind of extras or commentary on this disc.",5,Two of Keaton's best feature films,1208044800,"04 13, 2008",2008,2661,"['two', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'sequentially', 'Hospitality', 'late', '1923', 'Sherlock', 'Jr.', 'early', '1924', 'Hospitality', 'was', 'Keaton', 'second', 'feature', 'film', 'went', 'making', 'two-reel', '20', 'minute', 'short', 'films', 'feature', 'films', '1923', 'comic', 'take-off', 'Hatfield', 'McCoy', 'feud', '1880', 'here', 'Keaton', 'back', '1830', 'primarily', 'can', 'introduce', 'main', 'mechanical', 'gag', 'film', 'mechanically-accurate', 'faithful', 're-creation', 'early', 'locomotive', 'Stephenson', 'Rocket', 'train', 'moves', 'so', 'slowly', 'Keaton', 'dog', 'train', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'up', 'jist', 'story', 'Keaton', 'Willie', 'McKay', 'surviving', 'McKay', 'McKay/Canfield', 'feud', 'roughly', 'twenty', 'years', 'before', 'Willie', 'ancestral', 'home', 'Appalachia', 'inspect', 'property', 'inherited', 'journey', 'there', 'fall', 'young', 'lady', 'whom', 'traveling', 'out', 'be', 'Canfield', 'when', 'brothers', 'find', 'out', 'McKay', 'town', 'go', 'guns', 'However', 'patriarch', 'family', 'Big', 'Joe', 'Roberts', 'sons', 'code', 'hospitality', 'shoot', 'someone', 'house', 'Willie', 'who', 'been', 'invited', 'dinner', 'learns', 'best', 'not', 'leave', 'house.The', 'other', 'feature', 'Sherlock', 'Jr.', 'only', '45', 'minutes', 'long', 'actually', 'failed', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'today', 'considered', 'ground-breaking', 'Keaton', 'stunts', 'such', 'appearing', 'jump', 'woman', 'backed', 'up', 'fence', 'remained', 'secret', 'years', 'also', 'beginning', 'film', 'motion', 'picture', 'running', 'theatre', 'where', 'projectionist', 'Once', 'movie', 'screen', 'Keaton', 'adjust', 'strategy', 'scene', 'changes', 'front', 'steps', 'house', 'edge', 'cliff', 'lion', 'den.The', 'presence', 'interesting', 'film', 'tricks', ""n't"", 'mean', 'absence', 'plot', 'film', 'boy', 'Keaton', 'who', 'being', 'great', 'detective', 'girl', 'also', 'sought', 'dishonest', 'employee', 'father', 'who', 'Keaton', 'character', 'theft', 'result', 'ordered', 'never', 'return', 'girl', 'home', 'again', 'boy', 'back', 'job', 'projectionist', 'asleep', 'dreams', 'being', 'great', 'detective', 'Sherlock', 'Jr.If', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'Keaton', 'work', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'DVDs', 'were', 'released', 'when', 'DVD', 'technology', 'was', 'relatively', 'new', 'pictures', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'crisp', 'perhaps', 'could', 'be', 'However', 'video', 'quality', 'still', 'quite', 'good', 'main', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'Kino', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'kind', 'extras', 'commentary', 'disc']",N/A
370825,ACPLJ6XRXIZKD,6303366511,Cheated,"[12, 13]","In the first feature of this DVD, &quot;Our Hospitality&quot; (1923), Keaton shows us a period in American history rarely seen in the movies. The movie starts in 1810 when Keaton's character is a baby and leaps to 1830  when he's 21.  Keaton accurately shows us the period of the 1830s by riding  a pedalless bicycle, showing us the intersection of Broadway and 42nd  Street, which turns out to be the eye-popping rurality of his aunt's  cottage between 2 dirt roads, and travels from New York to the South on the  Stephenson Rocket, an early train which looks like a string of stage  coaches on railroad tracks.  Keaton has been informed that he's to claim  his family's estate in the South, and much of the movie is shown how  traveling by train in this period was so cumbersome.  Keaton throws in a  lot of gags about this such as the engineer (played by his real father Joe)  moving the train tracks with his bare hands in order to get the train past  a stubborn jackass, and he illustrates the relative speed of the train by  showing a dog outrunning it.  The basic plot of the film is that Keaton  meets a girl (played by his real life wife Natalie) on the train who turns  out to be the daughter of a family in which his own has been feuding with  for generations.  When Keaton gets to his destination in the South, he  finds that the estate he envisioned to be a pretty antebellum mansion turns  out to be a worthless dump.  However, he stays in town because he has been  invited by the girl on the train to have supper with her family.  When her  brothers and father find out who he is, they spend the rest of the movie  trying to execute him with their authentically portrayed pistols.  This  movie includes the most amazing stunt of Keaton's entire film career.  He  must save the girl from plunging to the bottom of a waterfall.  He ties  himself to a rope and swings over the falls, catching her as she's going  down.  Keaton injested so much water from this scene that he had to have  his stomach pumped.The second feature is &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot;  (1924), one of Keaton's all-time classics.  Keaton plays a shmoe film  projectionist who's treated disrespectfully by his boss and the rival for  the girl he's in love with.  After his rival arranges to have him accused  of stealing her dad's watch (again played by Keaton's real life father  Joe), he dreams he's a brilliant, flawless detective, and it's in this  sequence that we get some of the most classic images of Keaton's career, in  particular with Keaton speeding through the streets of L.A. on the  handlebars of a motorcycle (you can see Harley printed on the side of it),  oblivious of the fact that it has no driver (who fell off after driving  through a dip).  It also features more Keaton train-related gags.  There's  a fun scene where Keaton, still sitting on the riderless motorcycle,  narrowly misses a train and also gets hit on top of a train by a splurge of  water from a water tower spout.  Years later, Keaton discovered that he'd  broken his neck while filming this scene.  Only one thing annoyed me about  this film, and it had nothing to do with Keaton.  Someone slipped in a  90's-composed film score that's totally out of place accompanying this  movie.  We get to hear a mishmash of '60s Las Vegas lounge, Hawaiian,  southern blues, striptease, '40s swing bands, and '60s beach party that  ends with a few notes of the James Bond theme.  The music is actually good,  but it doesn't belong here.  My advice is to buy this DVD if you admire  Keaton, but turn the volume down to zero when &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot;  comes on.",5,More of Keaton's Obsession With Trains,951004800,"02 20, 2000",2000,3618,"['first', 'feature', 'DVD', 'quot', 'Hospitality', 'quot', '1923', 'Keaton', 'period', 'American', 'history', 'rarely', 'seen', 'movies', 'movie', '1810', 'when', 'Keaton', 'character', 'baby', 'leaps', '1830', 'when', '21', 'Keaton', 'accurately', 'period', '1830s', 'riding', 'pedalless', 'bicycle', 'showing', 'intersection', 'Broadway', '42nd', 'Street', 'out', 'be', 'eye-popping', 'rurality', 'aunt', 'cottage', '2', 'dirt', 'roads', 'travels', 'New', 'York', 'South', 'Stephenson', 'Rocket', 'early', 'train', 'string', 'stage', 'coaches', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'Keaton', 'been', 'informed', 'claim', 'family', 'estate', 'South', 'much', 'movie', 'shown', 'how', 'traveling', 'train', 'period', 'was', 'so', 'cumbersome', 'Keaton', 'lot', 'gags', 'such', 'engineer', 'played', 'real', 'father', 'Joe', 'moving', 'train', 'tracks', 'bare', 'hands', 'order', 'get', 'train', 'stubborn', 'jackass', 'relative', 'speed', 'train', 'showing', 'dog', 'outrunning', 'basic', 'plot', 'film', 'Keaton', 'girl', 'played', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'Natalie', 'train', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'daughter', 'family', 'own', 'been', 'feuding', 'generations', 'When', 'Keaton', 'destination', 'South', 'estate', 'envisioned', 'be', 'pretty', 'antebellum', 'mansion', 'out', 'be', 'worthless', 'dump', 'However', 'town', 'been', 'invited', 'girl', 'train', 'have', 'supper', 'family', 'When', 'brothers', 'father', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'spend', 'rest', 'movie', 'trying', 'execute', 'authentically', 'portrayed', 'pistols', 'movie', 'most', 'amazing', 'stunt', 'Keaton', 'entire', 'film', 'career', 'must', 'save', 'girl', 'plunging', 'bottom', 'waterfall', 'rope', 'swings', 'falls', 'catching', 'going', 'down', 'Keaton', 'injested', 'so', 'much', 'water', 'scene', 'had', 'have', 'stomach', 'pumped.The', 'second', 'feature', 'quot', 'Sherlock', 'Jr.', 'quot', '1924', 'one', 'Keaton', 'all-time', 'classics', 'Keaton', 'shmoe', 'film', 'projectionist', 'who', 'treated', 'disrespectfully', 'boss', 'rival', 'girl', 'love', 'rival', 'arranges', 'have', 'accused', 'stealing', 'dad', 'watch', 'again', 'played', 'Keaton', 'real', 'life', 'father', 'Joe', 'brilliant', 'flawless', 'detective', 'sequence', 'get', 'most', 'classic', 'images', 'Keaton', 'career', 'particular', 'Keaton', 'speeding', 'streets', 'L.A.', 'handlebars', 'motorcycle', 'can', 'see', 'Harley', 'printed', 'side', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'driver', 'who', 'fell', 'off', 'driving', 'dip', 'also', 'more', 'Keaton', 'train-related', 'gags', 'fun', 'scene', 'where', 'Keaton', 'still', 'sitting', 'riderless', 'motorcycle', 'narrowly', 'train', 'also', 'hit', 'top', 'train', 'splurge', 'water', 'water', 'tower', 'spout', 'Years', 'later', 'Keaton', 'discovered', ""'d"", 'broken', 'neck', 'filming', 'scene', 'Only', 'one', 'thing', 'annoyed', 'film', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'Keaton', 'Someone', 'slipped', ""90's-composed"", 'film', 'score', 'totally', 'place', 'accompanying', 'movie', 'get', 'hear', 'mishmash', ""'60s"", 'Las', 'Vegas', 'lounge', 'Hawaiian', 'southern', 'blues', 'striptease', ""'40s"", 'swing', 'bands', ""'60s"", 'beach', 'party', 'few', 'notes', 'James', 'Bond', 'theme', 'music', 'actually', 'good', ""n't"", 'belong', 'here', 'My', 'advice', 'buy', 'DVD', 'admire', 'Keaton', 'turn', 'volume', 'down', 'zero', 'when', 'quot', 'Sherlock', 'Jr.', 'quot']",N/A
370826,A3M3FG82ZE1J8I,6303366511,"Ed N ""Ed""","[26, 29]","I am a Buster Keaton fan, even though I had only seen a few of his films until now.  My favorite remains &quot;The General&quot; which is a great Civil War adventure with a lot of laughs, too.  This Kino DVD, a combo of Sherlock Jr and Our Hospitality, is hilarious! Our Hospitality is the first on the DVD and tells the tale of Buster Keaton's woes when he wanders into an old blood feud between families and spends half the film blissfully unaware that he is a walking bullseye.  The film is set in the 1830s and has some hilarious scenes, such as the early railroad trip back to the old homestead (some of the jokes in this part are a prelude to The General) and some great stunt work (Keaton on the edge of a REAL waterfall).  And Keaton does all his own stunts, it's amazing he didn't hurt himself more often!Sherlock Jr. is probably one of Keaton's more famous works, but to be honest, I liked the first movie on the DVD more.  This one is funny, too, but it's kinda scattered, plot-wise.  Keaton plays a movie projectionist who enters his movie (in a dream), solves the mystery, and saves the girl.  It's really an excuse for some great special effects (back in those days, at least!).  I guess some things never change (I wonder if Sherlock Jr. was a summer film...) but this film is still really really funny.  Back to back, these films are funnier and more original than almost anything you'd see in theaters today.Just a few words about the DVD itself - these films are 70+ years old, so they aren't in perfect condition.  Our Hospitality has scratches and dust.  The source print is ok but looks its age.  At least the image is clear with good contrast, unlike a lot of silent films which look all black with patches of white.  Sherlock Jr's print source is great! It almost looks new and has great contrast.  Plus, the best part is the soundtrack.  The Sherlock Jr soundtrack is really jazzy with bits of James Bond/Batman/saxophone music; it doesn't have the typical ragtime piano or organ music you usually hear and it really makes the movie sound fantastic (that's something you don't hear much about silent films...)

370827,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6303366511,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","OUR HOSPITALITY (writ./dir. Buster Keaton, 1923, 73 minutes) is another favorite of mine given to us by the immortal Buster Keaton. I rank this with hisThe General (The Ultimate Two-Disc Edition)andOur Hospitality/Sherlock, Jr.(I recommend this awesome two-fer DVD set).Set in the Antebellum South (1830, Keaton was impossibly ahead of his time making this period authentic-looking) Buster plays Willie McKay, a New York-bred unwilling member of the old Canfield-McKay feud. (Loosely based on the Hatfield-McCoy feud that really lasted only a few years; you'll see this story ends like the Hatfield-McCoy feud also.) The dramatic beginning of the film, aflashback showing us what happened 20 years earlier, is a stunning innovation, the first of its kind.Thus BK invented the flashback as we know it today, and he also invented the idea of introducing a film with the flashback.Returning to Kentucky to claim his inheritance (an ""estate"" that will make you howl with laughter when you see it), Willie soon falls right into the arms of the waiting Canfields. They are, of course, waiting to kill him. Luckily for him he is already sweet on the young Canfield girl (played by his 2nd wife Natalie Talmage Keaton) and this will save him later.Uniquely, Buster's son Buster, Jr., plays him at age 1. Natalie Talmage would ruin BK in their divorce, taking everything and then some. It is said she was the one who drove him to drink, and also drove him to lose his early silent short films which were found by James Mason in the mid-1950s.There is a waterfall scene in this, and all I'll tell you is Keaton designed and had built the entire thing on one of his lots. Goes to show you, alongside works like THE GENERAL, what Keaton was capable of achieving. You will marvel at Keaton's partly rebuilt, partly restored Stephenson's Rocket locomotive ... and yes, they really did ride those once upon a time.Another bittersweet detail: Joe Roberts (Old Man Canfield), a dear friend and traditional heavy in Keaton's films, suffered a heart attack while filming. He insisted on returning to finish the film - and died very shortly after they wrapped. Keaton's films are filled with disasters, hair-raising, realistic and funny as hell. Just as often they are filled with tragedies: in this film, aside from Roberts' mortal heart attack, Keaton was brutally carried off by the water and almost drowned. The scene, with a barely visible Keaton looking like a drowned rat, remains in the film at his demand.As my mother and I both used to say, What is a Buster Keaton film without him almost dying in the process of making it? While this film unjustly does not have the level of accolades awarded to THE GENERAL, no one can miss watching it. Here for the first time, Keaton experiments fully with his signature lighting, model sets, fully built sets to fool the eye and daring camera shots. A lot of people think he and his girl are stranded on a real cliff somehwere; it's all part of the set BK built on the lot!The acting is refreshing and surprising. Everyone seems extremely realistic except for that ham, good old Roberts, bless him. Keaton loved to have the Old Schoolers starring in his films as often as possible, rolling their kohled eyes and hamming it up. He never forgot his friends, his vaudeville fellows, or his family. In fact there are always rumors about this movie that BK's assistant or 2nd unit director was his best friend Fatty Arbuckle. Although this certainly does not quite reach the heights of THE GENERAL, this is Buster Keaton at his prime!There is another saying in my family: every filmmaker, director, comedian, special effects person, producer and writer, everyone, has copied Buster Keaton. Yet so few people are conversant with his life's work. So how can anyone remotely interested in film miss this?!",5,Keaton's Real McCoy,1317513600,"10 2, 2011",2011,3825,"['OUR', 'HOSPITALITY', 'writ./dir', 'Buster', 'Keaton', '1923', '73', 'minutes', 'favorite', 'mine', 'given', 'immortal', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'rank', 'hisThe', 'General', 'Ultimate', 'Two-Disc', 'Edition', 'andOur', 'Hospitality/Sherlock', 'Jr.', 'recommend', 'awesome', 'two-fer', 'DVD', 'set', '.Set', 'Antebellum', 'South', '1830', 'Keaton', 'was', 'impossibly', 'ahead', 'time', 'making', 'period', 'authentic-looking', 'Buster', 'Willie', 'McKay', 'New', 'York-bred', 'unwilling', 'member', 'old', 'Canfield-McKay', 'feud', 'Loosely', 'based', 'Hatfield-McCoy', 'feud', 'really', 'lasted', 'only', 'few', 'years', ""'ll"", 'see', 'story', 'Hatfield-McCoy', 'feud', 'also', 'dramatic', 'beginning', 'film', 'aflashback', 'showing', 'happened', '20', 'years', 'earlier', 'stunning', 'innovation', 'first', 'kind.Thus', 'BK', 'invented', 'flashback', 'know', 'today', 'also', 'invented', 'idea', 'introducing', 'film', 'flashback.Returning', 'Kentucky', 'claim', 'inheritance', 'estate', 'will', 'make', 'howl', 'laughter', 'when', 'see', 'Willie', 'soon', 'right', 'arms', 'waiting', 'Canfields', 'are', 'course', 'waiting', 'kill', 'Luckily', 'already', 'sweet', 'young', 'Canfield', 'girl', 'played', '2nd', 'wife', 'Natalie', 'Talmage', 'Keaton', 'will', 'save', 'later.Uniquely', 'Buster', 'son', 'Buster', 'Jr.', 'age', '1', 'Natalie', 'Talmage', 'would', 'ruin', 'BK', 'divorce', 'taking', 'everything', 'then', 'said', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'drove', 'drink', 'also', 'drove', 'lose', 'early', 'silent', 'short', 'films', 'were', 'found', 'James', 'Mason', 'mid-1950s.There', 'waterfall', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'Keaton', 'designed', 'had', 'built', 'entire', 'thing', 'one', 'lots', 'Goes', 'show', 'alongside', 'THE', 'GENERAL', 'what', 'Keaton', 'was', 'capable', 'achieving', 'will', 'marvel', 'Keaton', 'partly', 'partly', 'restored', 'Stephenson', 'Rocket', 'locomotive', 'yes', 'really', 'did', 'ride', 'once', 'time.Another', 'bittersweet', 'detail', 'Joe', 'Roberts', 'Old', 'Man', 'Canfield', 'dear', 'friend', 'traditional', 'heavy', 'Keaton', 'films', 'suffered', 'heart', 'attack', 'filming', 'insisted', 'returning', 'finish', 'film', 'died', 'very', 'shortly', 'wrapped', 'Keaton', 'films', 'are', 'filled', 'disasters', 'hair-raising', 'realistic', 'funny', 'hell', 'Just', 'often', 'are', 'filled', 'tragedies', 'film', 'aside', 'Roberts', 'mortal', 'heart', 'attack', 'Keaton', 'was', 'brutally', 'carried', 'off', 'water', 'almost', 'drowned', 'scene', 'barely', 'visible', 'Keaton', 'looking', 'drowned', 'rat', 'film', 'demand.As', 'mother', 'used', 'say', 'What', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'film', 'almost', 'dying', 'process', 'making', 'film', 'unjustly', 'not', 'have', 'level', 'accolades', 'awarded', 'THE', 'GENERAL', 'one', 'can', 'miss', 'watching', 'Here', 'first', 'time', 'Keaton', 'fully', 'signature', 'lighting', 'model', 'sets', 'fully', 'built', 'sets', 'fool', 'eye', 'daring', 'camera', 'shots', 'lot', 'people', 'think', 'girl', 'are', 'stranded', 'real', 'cliff', 'somehwere', 'part', 'set', 'BK', 'built', 'lot', 'acting', 'refreshing', 'surprising', 'Everyone', 'extremely', 'realistic', 'ham', 'good', 'old', 'Roberts', 'bless', 'Keaton', 'loved', 'have', 'Old', 'Schoolers', 'starring', 'films', 'as', 'often', 'possible', 'rolling', 'kohled', 'eyes', 'hamming', 'up', 'never', 'forgot', 'friends', 'vaudeville', 'fellows', 'family', 'fact', 'are', 'always', 'rumors', 'movie', 'BK', 'assistant', '2nd', 'unit', 'director', 'was', 'best', 'friend', 'Fatty', 'Arbuckle', 'certainly', 'not', 'quite', 'reach', 'heights', 'THE', 'GENERAL', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'prime', 'saying', 'family', 'filmmaker', 'director', 'comedian', 'special', 'effects', 'person', 'producer', 'writer', 'everyone', 'copied', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'so', 'few', 'people', 'are', 'conversant', 'life', 'work', 'how', 'can', 'anyone', 'remotely', 'interested', 'film', 'miss']",N/A
370828,A742NFYPDU2P,6303366511,Evan E. Richards,"[8, 8]","These were two of the most amazing and creative films I have seen in months. Buster Keaton wrote, directed, acted, and did all his own stunts in these two films. He even did stunts for a lot of the other actors in these films too.""Our hospitality"" is the story of a feud between two families that reaches a crisis point when Keaton falls in love with a daughter in the other family. In ""Sherlock Jr."" Keaton plays an aspiring detective and movie projectionist who dreams that he is a famous and skilled detective. Not only are these two films engaging, well made, and interesting, they are funny!! I go weeks sometimes without laughing at a sitcom or a movie that is supposed to be a comedy. I found myself laughing out loud numerous times during this film.There are some classic scenes that just stand out when you watch these movies. The whole ""floating down the river"" scene at the end of ""Our Hospitality"" is jaw-dropping. These have got to be some of the most dangerous stunts ever attempted. In ""Sherlock Jr."" there is a pool game where every ball on the table is bounced around except for one which is miraculously untouched, there is the harrowing motorcycle ride, there is the escape from the gangsters, I could go on an on.These films are like live action Bugs Bunny cartoon. There were several occasions where as I was watching these movies, trying to anticipate what was going to happen next I said to myself, ""No way. He's not really going to do that. That's not even possible. No sane man would attempt a stunt like that."" And yet...he does.There are about 4 or 5 scenes from both of these films which are completely seared into my brain. That isn't an easy thing to do. Most films don't have one memorable scene, and to have a single film with 5 or 6 of these scenes is nothing short of amazing.They just don't make filmmakers like Buster Keaton anymore. I wish I knew where his creativity came from. If directors today could channel even a fraction of the skill that Keaton exhibited, cinema would be an amazing and wonderful place.",5,No one does physical comedy better than Keaton.

370829,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,6303366511,Frederick Baptist,"[9, 10]","It's a real shame Buster couldn't make the transition in the advent of sound the way his contemporary, the late, great Charles Chaplin did but just like Chaplin, Keaton was an excellent exponent of the art of slapstick comedy.  Both were great acrobats and athletes and really great actors.  It struck me while I was watching this dvd how much better all the actors were in those days; I suppose without the aid of sound, these guys had to convince the audience solely based on their acting skills.  To put it another way, Keanu Reeves would fall flat on his face if he had to ply his trade in those days.  Alternatively, Jackie Chan would have done very well; he, just like Keaton and Chaplin did, does most if not all of his own stunts and suffered sometimes serious injuries for his art.The two episodes here though probably represent the best of Keaton's work with Sherlock Jr shading it just a little as the better of the two.  While ""Our Hospitality"" is hilarious and the longer episode, Sherlock Jr has a lot of truly memorable and creative elements one of which has been heavily borrowed and made into the main premise of the not-too-long-ago Schwarzenegger movie, ""Last Action Hero"" where Keaton literally jumps into the scene of a movie within a movie albeit in his dreams.  Keaton's acting on both these episodes is also brilliant and for one grown up on ""talkies"" all my life, I still found that I could enjoy these silent movies.The video restoration work is commendable given what must have been the state of the original master tapes.  I do however have a beef with the misleading information on the cover: ""Digitally Mastered from Archival Prints with ORIGINAL MUSICAL SCORES.""  The answer to this ambiguous statement is that ORIGINAL here means newly composed and recorded and NOT the original scores as was played in the movie houses of the day.  I guess in hindsight it should have been obvious to me as in those days, it was really just the video and some guy playing live on the piano at the movie house and so it would have been unlikely that any sound recording would have been available but they could have at least attempted to stay true to the spirit of the sound of that day.  Instead, although the sound quality of this modern recording is very good, we get an anachronistic treatment of the score for the ""Sherlock Jr."" episode with James Bond themes included in the score which threw me off and which I found off-putting to say the least.  Not only did the score not fit the video but it was also very loud and distracts one from the important thing which is the acting.That aside, any student of film, particularly the history and development of comedy, or indeed anyone interested in the work of Buster Keaton and would like a sample of his best work need look no further.

OUR HOSPITALITY is Buster's take on the Hatfield and McCoy feud (the families here are called Canfield and McKay).

This attention to detail  truly enhances the comedy.  SHERLOCK, JR. gets my vote as Buster's best  feature.  A wild film that parodies the detective films of the era,  SHERLOCK, JR. contains some eye-popping effects that were done live on the  set (the JURASSIC PARK age of special effects being some 70 years off).  Fortunately for  Keaton, he was his own best special effect.

Still, this being a Keaton movie it has some memorable bits.  There's a lovely train ride sequence.  And when Keaton is in the house of his beloved & discovers that Southern Hospitality doesn't extend beyond the confines of the family manse he manages some very funny moments.  There is a joke involving a horse that is so expertly done it is forever fresh & toward the end of the movie there are some exciting stunts along a river.  But the thing here is SHERLOCK JR.  This is possibly the most astonishing 45 minutes ever put on film & is Keaton at his best.  Ostensibly the movie is about Keaton, who is the projectionist at the local movie house & is reading a teach yourself course in private detection, defending himself against accusations of stealing a watch belonging to his sweetheart's father.  But when, in one of the most famous moments in cinema, he dreams himself into the movie he is projecting this movie becomes a fine example of native surrealism.  Keaton plays with perceptions of time & reality & pulls off one felicitious invention after another.  There is the billiard game that every one copied for the next 50 years.  And the escape through a window involving a dress that no one copied because no one could figure out how it was done even though it's all there in front of you from set-up to finish.  And, finally, a ride with Keaton on the handlebars of an otherwise unoccupied motorcycle that everyone is still copying.  But the original here remains supreme.

There's even a segment which mimics present-day minimalistic composer Phillip Glass.  This anachronistic stylistic mishmash didn't work for me at all.

Unfortunately, McKay's family has been involved in a backwoods feud with the Canfield family who are determined to kill off the last surviving McKay.Further complicating matters, Willie finds himself falling in love with the elder Canfield's daughter who invites him to dinner.  The Canfields will not shoot McKay in their house as this violates their code of honor (there is apparently nothing dishonorable about shooting McKay outside).  This leads to a series of hilarious comic situations as Willie must find ways to prolong his visit.  Later, when he runs out of excuses, he must find a way to sneak out without being recognized.  Wait till you see what he uses for a disguise!The film leads up to a hilarious and exciting chase sequence ending on a river.  Buster Keaton was quite the acrobat.  It's amusing how throughout the film he pokes fun at the south's twisted sense of hospitality.  There's also a surprisingly touching finale.""Sherlock Jr."" is another great, albeit short film.  Buster plays a hapless movie projectionist and amateur detective who is wrongly accused of stealing his girlfriend's father's watch.  Ostrasized by his girlfriend, Buster falls asleep in the projection room and in his dream, walks into the movie and interacts with the characters.  In his dream, he imagines himself as the great detective Sherlock Jr. and attempts to find the culprit of a stolen watch.""Sherlock Jr."" is an interesting film as it deals with Keaton's fascination with the film medium.  The special effects for the scene where Buster walks into the screen were incredible for their time.  This scene has been copied a lot in subsequent films.  Unfortunately, the film is marred somewhat by the inane music score which someone decided to tack on.  Nevertheless, it's well worth viewing.Buster Keaton was a genius.

370846,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6303366511,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","Sherlock, Jr. (Buster Keaton, 1924)If you gather fifty critics and ask them all what Buster Keaton's greatest achievement was, most of them would likely answer The General. A select few, however, might choose Sherlock, Jr.; I'm one of them. I liked The General, but I loved Sherlock, Jr.Keaton plays a janitor at a movie theater who's studying to be a detective. Both he and the town cad (Ward Crane) are romancing the town beauty (Kathryn McGuire). The cad steals a watch and pawns it in order to get the beauty a gift, then pins the crime on Keaton. Crushed and unjustly cast out, Keaton goes back to his job, falls asleep, and dreams himself in a crime film, where he becomes Sherlock, Jr., the world's greatest detective.This short (44 min.) piece is a constant stream of stunts and sight gags, with Keaton and his usual team of writers throwing the plot away at the drop of a hat for a gag. (Just after Keaton enters the film, there's a spectacular series of scene changes that's been imitated and lampooned any number of times.) The jokes themselves are spectacular, and the movie, with its rather straightforward plot, doesn't suffer at all from getting sidetracked now and then. A wonderful, wonderful piece of work. **** * * *Our Hospitality (Buster Keaton, 1923)Discovering Buster Keaton's work after eighty years is a treat. Our Hospitality is a wonderful piece of work, the kind of thing I've always wanted in comedy, but during my youth was passed over by television stations in favor of the Three Stooges and the Little Rascals. Well, at least I have a chance to see them now, and I couldn't be happier.Based on the feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys, Our Hosopitality casts Keaton as Willie McKay, who's been raised in the North and is only told about the generations-long feud when he's on his way to the old family homestead after the death of his father. On the train down, he meets and becomes fond of a woman (Natalie Talmadge, Keaton's real-life wife, in her final screen appearance) who turns out to be Virginia Canfield, from the rival Canfield clan. Virginia invites Willie over to dinner. The family patriarch, Joseph (Joe Roberts, also in his final screen role; he suffered a stroke during the filing of the movie, and died shortly thereafter), insists to his sons that they can't kill Willie while he's a guest in their house, but the men of the family plot to get rid of him as soon as he steps outside. Thus begins an extended and wonderful sequence of Willie trying to figure out how to get outside and back in without anyone in the family save Virginia knowing he's doing it.This is funny stuff, much more so than the things I had to content myself with during my younger years. Keaton was a gifted comedic talent, and those around him play excellent straight men. A fantastic piece of work all around. **** ",5,Keaton's finest moment?,1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,2846,"['Sherlock', 'Jr.', 'Buster', 'Keaton', '1924', 'gather', 'fifty', 'critics', 'ask', 'what', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'greatest', 'achievement', 'was', 'most', 'would', 'likely', 'answer', 'General', 'select', 'few', 'however', 'might', 'choose', 'Sherlock', 'Jr.', ""'m"", 'one', 'liked', 'General', 'loved', 'Sherlock', 'Jr.Keaton', 'janitor', 'movie', 'theater', 'who', 'studying', 'be', 'detective', 'town', 'cad', 'Ward', 'Crane', 'are', 'romancing', 'town', 'beauty', 'Kathryn', 'McGuire', 'cad', 'watch', 'pawns', 'order', 'get', 'beauty', 'gift', 'then', 'crime', 'Keaton', 'Crushed', 'unjustly', 'cast', 'out', 'Keaton', 'back', 'job', 'asleep', 'crime', 'film', 'where', 'Sherlock', 'Jr.', 'world', 'greatest', 'detective.This', 'short', '44', 'min', 'piece', 'constant', 'stream', 'stunts', 'sight', 'gags', 'Keaton', 'usual', 'team', 'writers', 'throwing', 'plot', 'away', 'drop', 'hat', 'gag', 'Just', 'Keaton', 'film', 'spectacular', 'series', 'scene', 'changes', 'been', 'imitated', 'lampooned', 'number', 'times', 'jokes', 'are', 'spectacular', 'movie', 'rather', 'straightforward', 'plot', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'getting', 'sidetracked', 'now', 'then', 'wonderful', 'wonderful', 'piece', 'work', '****', '*', '*', '*Our', 'Hospitality', 'Buster', 'Keaton', '1923', 'Discovering', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'work', 'eighty', 'years', 'treat', 'Hospitality', 'wonderful', 'piece', 'work', 'kind', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'comedy', 'youth', 'was', 'passed', 'television', 'stations', 'favor', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'Well', 'least', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'now', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier.Based', 'feud', 'Hatfields', 'McCoys', 'Hosopitality', 'Keaton', 'Willie', 'McKay', 'who', 'been', 'raised', 'North', 'only', 'told', 'generations-long', 'feud', 'when', 'way', 'old', 'family', 'homestead', 'death', 'father', 'train', 'down', 'fond', 'woman', 'Natalie', 'Talmadge', 'Keaton', 'real-life', 'wife', 'final', 'screen', 'appearance', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'Virginia', 'Canfield', 'rival', 'Canfield', 'clan', 'Virginia', 'Willie', 'dinner', 'family', 'patriarch', 'Joseph', 'Joe', 'Roberts', 'also', 'final', 'screen', 'role', 'suffered', 'stroke', 'filing', 'movie', 'died', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'sons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'kill', 'Willie', 'guest', 'house', 'men', 'family', 'plot', 'get', 'rid', 'as', 'soon', 'outside', 'Thus', 'extended', 'wonderful', 'sequence', 'Willie', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'outside', 'back', 'anyone', 'family', 'save', 'Virginia', 'knowing', 'doing', 'it.This', 'funny', 'stuff', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'things', 'had', 'content', 'younger', 'years', 'Keaton', 'was', 'gifted', 'comedic', 'talent', 'play', 'excellent', 'straight', 'men', 'fantastic', 'piece', 'work', 'around', '****']",N/A

More than just tremendously funny, &quot;Sherlock Jr&quot; is heartfelt and sweet. Everything comes out of a scheme to make Buster appear to be a criminal in front of his love, while he is all the while attempting to imprese her with a present on a meager salery. Poor Buster is sent away dejected, with a competitor for his love's affection taking credit for his gift and his love thinking him a bad person. Buster attempts to rectify the situation by using his skills as an amateur detective to find the real criminal. This soon fails and he is forced to return to his job as a film projectionist, showing a mystery/detective story and daydreaming, the spot where one of the most perfect comedy scenes in film history takes place. Of course it all turns out well in the end-- who thought it wouldn't?--but the way that it gets there is funny and memorable, and shouldn't be missed by any movie fan.Even those who usually do not enjoy silent films will like Buster Keaton's &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot; I know this because my eight-year-old brother loves the movie, and he is patently againt black and white movies, much less silent films.

370849,A2D63RN5LF14R2,6303366511,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[1, 1]","Buster Keaton never aligned himself with the Surrealists or the avant-garde. His late in life experience acting in Samuel Becket's Film (1965) proved a negative experience for the actor. Yet, Keaton possessed aesthetic qualities akin to Surrealist tenets, which made him a revered figure in that movement. Together with Playhouse (1921) and Frozen North (1922), Sherlock Jr. (1924) is one of Keaton's most pronounced ventures into slapstick Surrealism.At 45 minutes Sherlock Jr. is often listed as both a short and a feature. By 1924 standards it was considered a feature. Either way, it is perhaps the most innovative comedy of the entire silent era and it retains a formidable reputation among Keaton's body of work. Being one of the earliest films about film, Sherlock Jr. blurs distinctions between real life and the dream world of cinema, but the phantasmagoric qualities always serve a linear narrative.In this meticulously crafted, compact film, Keaton is a movie projectionist who dreams of being a detective. Keaton is trying to win the affections of a girl (Kathryn McGuire), but has a dastardly rival (Ward Crane). In attempt to steal McGuire from Keaton, Crane frames our protagonist as a thief. With his ""How To Be A Detective"" book in hand, Keaton follows closely on the heels of Crane.The basic theme of any Keaton film is an everyday man attempting to win a pretty girl. Naturally, he encounters unrequited love and then must overcome insurmountable odds to win the heroine's affections, which he usually does. The consummation of hero and heroine is of no interest, it is in the journey to true love that we encounter the joy of Keaton's cinematic foreplay. Tensions, triumphs, failures and rebounds populate his promenade.Keaton, who disavowed any claims of intellectualism, simply was inventive in spicing that repeated dish. Yet, Keaton's interpretation of ""spice"" was, by any standards, a fearless one. Although he looks the part of a stone faced average Joe, once the projectionist dreams himself into celluloid, he becomes a flawless and imposing detective. Only someone with Keaton's athletic abilities could have pulled the transition off so brilliantly. Keaton did, however, fracture his neck during the making of the film, which resulted in years of severe migraines. This was one of numerous injuries Keaton sustained throughout his career. In addition to aesthetic muscle flexing, Keaton shows off his virtuoso prowess as a billiard player in a compelling vignette. Despite that, Keaton never fails to remember his primary goal: to be a clown.One of the funniest and most clever scenes in Sherlock Jr. is its finale in which actors on a fifty-foot screen teach the projectionist how to kiss a girl.Sherlock Jr. was a substantial influence on Woody Allen`s Purple Rose of Cairo (1985).*Our Hospitality (1923) was Buster Keaton`s first true feature film. Keaton's previous ""feature,"" Three Ages (1923) was actually three short films assembled together. There was both an artistic and a commercial reason for this: Three Ages was a parody of the similarly structured D.W. Griffith feature Intolerance (1916). Additionally, Keaton had proved his audience appeal in shorts. Metro Pictures realized the inherent risk of a Keaton feature, and the structure of Three Ages created the option of breaking it down into three shorts. Fortunately for all concerned, Three Ages was a commercial and critical success.Our Hospitality may be seen, in retrospect, as a model for Keaton's features and a precursor to The General (1926). What separates Keaton from his peers (Chaplin, Lloyd, Langdon) is the way his character integrates into a larger narrative. That is not to say that Keaton's films are not character driven, but the character serves the narrative, not vice versa.Our Hospitality opens with a prologue of the ongoing feud between the Canfields and the McKays. A young Canfield and the McKay patriarch are killed in a rainy shoot out at night. To avoid the curse of the feud and further bloodshed, the McKay widow takes her infant son, Willie, and sends him north to New York. Meanwhile, the Canfields swear revenge.Twenty years later, Willie (Keaton) is the personification of a 19th century New York Yankee, adorned in a dandified suit. His mother has since passed away when Willie learns he has inherited his father's estate. Imagining a southern mansion waiting in the wings, Willie hops onto the next train like a salmon returning to its birthplace. Before departing, he is warned by his guardian to stay clear of the Canfields.The trip south foreshadows the archaic world Willie is about to enter. The train itself is primitive and, naturally, encounters numerous mishaps along the way. Luckily for Willie, the ordeal is made bearable because his fellow passenger is a pretty girl (Natalie Talmadge, the first Mrs. Keaton). Unfortunately, Willie's spawning choice here, unknown to him, is a Canfield daughter.There are numerous aquatic metaphors. Willie stands apart from his fellows, like a fish out of water, with city clicker suit and queer umbrella. While fishing, he catches a minnow, throws it back, and then gets pulled into the water by a bigger fish. Willie's mansion turns out to be a dilapidated shack and he unwittingly finds himself in the home of his sworn enemies. True to Southern hospitality, the Canfields vow not kill Willie while he is a guest in their home. When Willie learns of this, he naturally tries to remain a permanent houseguest. Almost forced out, Willie is saved from leaving by the sudden appearance of a heavy downpour. A dam blows up, nearly drowning Willie, but it also safely conceals Willie from his predators, the Canfield boys. In a reversal of the fishing line, Willie is tied, by rope, to a Canfield son. Both get hauled into the water. A descent into the rapids brings further peril, as does a waterfall. Willie dangles over the waterfall like that salmon on a line. Yet, it is the waterfall which unites Willie with his girl, allowing him to spawn.Our Hospitality is replete with inventive sight gags (a tunnel is cut to fit the train, a horse's rear-end is disguised as Willie in drag), but it's really a sophisticated, yet simple retelling of the Romeo and Juliet narrative.* my review originally appeared at 366 weird movies.",5,Quintessential
