815947,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B0001XAKCE,Brian E. Erland,"[13, 14]","Are you like me when it comes to wandering around your local video store? Do you pick up one DVD case after another closely surveying the cover, or reading the description on the back in search of some undiscovered cinematic gem you've never heard of before? Do you trust that gut feeling, that occasional twinge of intuition that urges you to take a chance and rent something unknown?That's exactly how I came upon the obscure little gem from '02, `Bollywood Queen.' I absolutely fell in love with this movie just minutes into my first viewing. While this is by no means a big budget production, it's as good as one. The plot is solid, the acting excellent and the female star of the movie Preeya Kalidas is absolutely beautiful, which is a major pre-requisite for any guy to enjoy a romantic film.  Last but certainly not least I must mention the music which really lifts the movie to another level. It's an excellent Indian soundtrack displaying an imaginative blending of traditional and modern with a large dose of whimsy for good measure.This is one of those films that make up for all the films you took a chance on that let you down. `Bollywood Queen' is definitely a keeper, My Highest Recommendation!",5,"""Mad, Bad, You Know, Beautiful ~ That's Bollywood""",1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,1210,"['Are', 'when', 'wandering', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'Do', 'pick', 'up', 'one', 'DVD', 'case', 'closely', 'surveying', 'cover', 'reading', 'description', 'back', 'search', 'undiscovered', 'cinematic', 'gem', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'before', 'Do', 'trust', 'gut', 'feeling', 'occasional', 'twinge', 'intuition', 'take', 'chance', 'rent', 'something', 'unknown', 'exactly', 'how', 'came', 'obscure', 'little', 'gem', ""'02"", 'Bollywood', 'Queen', 'absolutely', 'fell', 'love', 'movie', 'just', 'minutes', 'first', 'viewing', 'means', 'big', 'budget', 'production', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'plot', 'solid', 'acting', 'excellent', 'female', 'star', 'movie', 'Preeya', 'Kalidas', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'major', 'pre-requisite', 'guy', 'enjoy', 'romantic', 'film', 'Last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'must', 'mention', 'music', 'really', 'movie', 'level', 'excellent', 'Indian', 'soundtrack', 'displaying', 'imaginative', 'blending', 'traditional', 'modern', 'large', 'dose', 'whimsy', 'good', 'measure.This', 'one', 'films', 'make', 'up', 'films', 'took', 'chance', 'let', 'down', 'Bollywood', 'Queen', 'definitely', 'keeper', 'My', 'Highest', 'Recommendation']",Bollywood Queen

I have seen like one Bollywood movie before so I already know what to expect. Dubbed singing, sudden blurps of music. You gotta just let go and enjoy the unique sounds of Indian music and the cinematic style.  There are moments of incredible beauty.  I bought this because I have recently grown interest in UK shows and films as well as James McAvoy's body of work.  There are moments where he is so ridiculously odd you can't help but laugh at him.  Every great actor has got to start somewhere and this is pretty bold and daring. His quality still shows.  If you are bored with the typical super polished super safe Hollywood stuff...try this. If you have never seen Bollywood this is a lovely introduction into this world.
