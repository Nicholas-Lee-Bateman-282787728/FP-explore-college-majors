315620,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,6302484499,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[3, 3]","I can't imagine any other actress' performance  equating with that of Katherine Hepburn.  It was marvelous.  The movie captured the sullen mood complete with the symbolic fog that languished in the air.  It was appropo to the long dark night that reflected characters' torment.  Each character did a fabulous job.  For those who enjoy dramatic plays, you won't even notice the 3 hours enhanced with lengthy profound dialogues.This fascinating dramatic play focuses on the life of an addicted, dysfunctional family that suffers greatly with their demons of the past. Eugene O'Neill's 1940 autobiographical story takes place in one long day and proceeds into the brooding night. It is a courageous account of the tortured soul and his haunted family.The movie performance and script was very close to the book.In the book's dedication to his wife, O'Neil writes, ""I give you the original script of this play of old sorrow, written in tears and blood.""The setting is August 1912, at the summer home where the fog lays heavily, foghorns blow loud contrasting with the chime of bells. The mood is somber just like the symbolic recurring fog that impairs vision and obscures reality. The bells are symbolic of the convent where the main character Mary Tyrone was happiest.The focus of the family is Mary, 54, wife, mother of two sons, wife of Tyrone. At the beginning, we are left to imagine and second guess what is bothering Mary and later it is clearly defined that she is addicted to morphine. Mary lives in the past, where she was in a convent and had a dream to be a concert pianist.James Tyrone, 65, an alcoholic known by his family as a miser, and whose real concern was to invest money into property rather then family because of a nagging fear from his childhood days -the threat of the poorhouse. He was considered a handsome stage actor and regrets what he could have been,- a great Shakespearean actor.Jamie Tyrone - the elder 34 year old son, another alcoholic always labeled a loser by his parents. He has a love-hate relationship with his younger brother Edmund as Jamie's confesses that because of his own hatred of himself, his role was to make his younger brother a failure too.Edmund Tyrone - 24-year old son is a reader of great literature and an aspiring poet. He has tuberculosis and with concern wonders whether his miser father will send him to a shabby institution. Eugene O'Neill is the real-life character of Edmund.O'Neill provides readers with more than adequate stage direction; we get a real sense of the way we are to interpret the readings including the shifting moods.

315622,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302484499,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","Maybe it's time I start reevaluating my opinion of Katherine Hepburn.  I have long stood by the opinion that she was merely good at what she does and nothing particularly special.  I've always boasted a preference for the 'other' Hepburn, Audrey, and have laid claim to the feeling that Katherine was one of the most overrated actresses in cinematic history.  Lately though, I've been watching a lot of her films either for the first time or again and I've found that the bulk of her work is very impressive.  Whether she's carrying a meandering film (`The African Queen'), stealing the limelight away from preferable talent (`Suddenly, Last Summer', where she steals my attention from Elizabeth Taylor, an actress I am much more fond of) or simply being brilliant in a brilliant film (`The Lion in Winter'), she is actually more than just `good' at what she does; she's very, very good.Yes, I still hold to the fact she has won far too many Oscars, and for sub par work at that (`On Golden Pond' and especially `Look Who's Coming to Dinner' are very mediocre performances at best), but I can no longer say that I don't care for her as an actress.Her talent is too big to ignore.So, that brings me to `Long Day's Journey into Night', Sidney Lumet's 1962 theatrical adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's play.  Based on O'Neill's home life, the story tells of a close knit family slowly falling apart due to addictions and sickness.  Mary Tyrone and husband James are in a tattered marriage.  James is a failed film star who struggles with alcoholism, which he seems to have handed down to his eldest son Jamie.  Mary, in order to cope with her youngest son's possible illness, has resorted to prescription medicines that `ease the pain'.  In fact, the youngest son Edmund seems to be the only rational one in the bunch.  The film takes place over one evening, while Edmund is awaiting test results.  Through the course of the evening the family seems to hash out some of their darkest fears and issues.  They confront the reasons behind Mary's addiction, as well as Jamie's harbored resentment for his younger brother.Yes, this is a stage play adaptation, and beings that it is a faithful one it does not contain much more than lengthy conversations; and with a running time of close to three hours it is not a film for the short of attention.The performances are truly what make this film so unforgettable.  Katherine Hepburn is stunning as the matriarch so close to her wits end.  Ralph Richardson is also brilliant as her husband James, attributing his character a balanced sense of frustration and contribution.  The real highlights, for me at least, come from Dean Stockwell and Jason Robards, who embody the sons with such fiery determination.  As Jamie, Robards is brutally abrasive, devouring his every internal demon.  A stark contrast is Stockwell, who gives Edmund the appearance of an observer, allowing him to take in his surroundings before deliberating.  All four of them are stunning, but in my opinion this film belongs to Stockwell (although Hepburn is a revelation, don't get me wrong).If you are a fan of the stage, the cast or the subject (I've always been drawn to the internal struggle of family life) then this is a film you must see.  I can't really think of a single flaw.  Like I mentioned, there is not much action, so if you are not used to this brand of film layout then you might not be pleased entirely.  There is a lot of talking; basically one conversation after the other, but the film is never boring for each actor emotes so well in such a small space.  I'd highly recommend this one; highly.",5,A very worthwhile journey into brilliance...,1241049600,"04 30, 2009",2009,3622,"['Maybe', 'time', 'start', 'reevaluating', 'opinion', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'have', 'long', 'stood', 'opinion', 'was', 'merely', 'good', 'what', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'special', ""'ve"", 'always', 'boasted', 'preference', ""'other"", 'Hepburn', 'Audrey', 'have', 'laid', 'claim', 'feeling', 'Katherine', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'overrated', 'actresses', 'cinematic', 'history', 'Lately', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'lot', 'films', 'first', 'time', 'again', ""'ve"", 'found', 'bulk', 'work', 'very', 'impressive', 'carrying', 'meandering', 'film', 'African', 'Queen', 'stealing', 'limelight', 'away', 'preferable', 'talent', 'Suddenly', 'Last', 'Summer', 'where', 'attention', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'actress', 'am', 'much', 'more', 'fond', 'simply', 'being', 'brilliant', 'brilliant', 'film', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'actually', 'more', 'just', 'good', 'what', 'very', 'very', 'good.Yes', 'still', 'hold', 'fact', 'won', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'Oscars', 'sub', 'par', 'work', 'Golden', 'Pond', 'especially', 'Look', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'are', 'very', 'mediocre', 'performances', 'best', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'actress.Her', 'talent', 'too', 'big', 'ignore.So', 'Long', 'Day', 'Journey', 'Night', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', '1962', 'theatrical', 'adaptation', 'Eugene', ""O'Neill"", 'play', 'Based', ""O'Neill"", 'home', 'life', 'story', 'tells', 'close', 'knit', 'family', 'slowly', 'falling', 'apart', 'due', 'addictions', 'sickness', 'Mary', 'Tyrone', 'husband', 'James', 'are', 'tattered', 'marriage', 'James', 'failed', 'film', 'star', 'who', 'alcoholism', 'have', 'handed', 'down', 'eldest', 'son', 'Jamie', 'Mary', 'order', 'cope', 'youngest', 'son', 'possible', 'illness', 'resorted', 'prescription', 'medicines', 'ease', 'pain', 'fact', 'youngest', 'son', 'Edmund', 'be', 'only', 'rational', 'one', 'bunch', 'film', 'place', 'one', 'evening', 'Edmund', 'awaiting', 'test', 'results', 'course', 'evening', 'family', 'hash', 'out', 'darkest', 'fears', 'issues', 'confront', 'reasons', 'Mary', 'addiction', 'as', 'well', 'Jamie', 'harbored', 'resentment', 'younger', 'brother.Yes', 'stage', 'play', 'adaptation', 'beings', 'faithful', 'one', 'not', 'contain', 'much', 'more', 'lengthy', 'conversations', 'running', 'time', 'close', 'three', 'hours', 'not', 'film', 'short', 'attention.The', 'performances', 'are', 'truly', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'so', 'unforgettable', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'stunning', 'matriarch', 'so', 'close', 'wits', 'end', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'also', 'brilliant', 'husband', 'James', 'attributing', 'character', 'balanced', 'sense', 'frustration', 'contribution', 'real', 'highlights', 'least', 'come', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'who', 'embody', 'sons', 'such', 'fiery', 'determination', 'Jamie', 'Robards', 'brutally', 'abrasive', 'devouring', 'internal', 'demon', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Stockwell', 'who', 'Edmund', 'appearance', 'observer', 'allowing', 'take', 'surroundings', 'deliberating', 'four', 'are', 'stunning', 'opinion', 'film', 'Stockwell', 'Hepburn', 'revelation', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'fan', 'stage', 'cast', 'subject', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'drawn', 'internal', 'struggle', 'family', 'life', 'then', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'single', 'flaw', 'mentioned', 'not', 'much', 'action', 'so', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'brand', 'film', 'layout', 'then', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'pleased', 'entirely', 'lot', 'talking', 'basically', 'one', 'conversation', 'other', 'film', 'never', 'boring', 'actor', 'so', 'well', 'such', 'small', 'space', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'highly']",Long Day's Journey Into Night VHS
315623,ARA48345JZPZR,6302484499,Archmaker,"[4, 4]","This is perhaps the greatest American play. If not, Long Day's Journey into Night is surely the greatest American tragedy.  Presented in its entirety by a brilliant cast, this excruciating journey into pain and remembrance is not to be missed by those who love great writing and great acting.This is arguably the finest cast to perform this work.  Many have commented that this is Katherine Hepburn's finest performance.  Watching her Mary Tyrone succumbing once more to her drug addiction and slipping away...away, is devastating.  I would like to recommend Ralph Richardson's James Tyrone as the definitive portrayal.  I have seen Olivier and Jack Lemmon and others tackle the role, but no one ever got the Old Ham's pomposity and penny-pinching pettiness with such sympathy for the old man's history and sheer human-ness in his weaknesses and foibles.  It is an indelible performance.Jason Robards made his name in the role of Jamey Tyrone on Broadway, and it is a polished performance we get here.  Dean Stockwell is fine as Edmund, it is just not as juicy a role being more catalyst and reaction to the others.As we watch these people peel back the layers of love and hate and resentment and old hurts and envy and jealously, while also exposing their great love and need for each other, we are watching Eugene O'Neill peel back the history and deep wounds of his own family with an unflinching honesty akin to watching him peel his own hide off to expose the blood and nerves and sinew beneath.  Hell yes it is painful, because he is dissecting and examining the lifelong hurts and pain that only those close to us can inflict, those wounds and scars carried the full extent of a lifetime.There is no better writing or acting to be found than what you will find here.  Sidney Lumet's direction does not get in the way, and the black &amp; white photography is appropriate to the mood and effect of the piece.  Though laced with black Irish humor throughout, this is nonetheless a brutally honest tragedy of loss and sadness.  Written with &quot;tears and blood&quot;...no kidding!Everybody knew what they were about here.  Direction &amp; cinematography are to serve the words and the performances.

But this is a very good rendition of it, with Katherine Hepburn as Mary Tyrone, Ralph Richardson as James Tyrone, Senior, Jason Robards, Jr., as James Tyrone, Junior (how's that for typecasting?), and Dean Stockwell as Edmund Tyrone.They're living in their summer home on a lake, which has never been finished off or decorated like a proper Victorian home, but has rough wood in the interior which has never been painted or papered. James, Senior, is a retired actor who invests in lousy land deals, gets ripped off, and is a primary tightwad as a result. He keeps talking about ending his life in the poor house.Mary is his vain, nervous, neurotic, and possibly psychotic wife, who is addicted to morphine. Elder son Jamie is a failure and a drunk. Younger son Edmund is diagnosed with consumption. Since Mary's father died of consumption when she was much too young to cope with it, she's in denial, and in mind-bending fear of losing her favorite son.This is a completely dysfunctional family with enough money to hide their dysfunction from the rest of the world. And enough acting ability to attempt to hide it from one another. Mary does the passive-aggressive thing where she says something terribly accusatory and then adds, ""But I'm not blaming you, dear . . ."" They all say the most biting things to one another and then apologize for them and declare how much they love each other. And apparently they do, ""in spite of it all,"" as both Mary and James put it on different occasions.As they deal with the crisis of Edmund's diagnosis, Mary's return to morphine, and the Jameses, father and son, and their sense of failure and alcoholic loss of self-control, the audience learns a lot about their history and why they are so screwed up. It's heart-breaking, but it's also hard to like them.Still, it's the script that is depressing, not the quality of the acting, the settings or the costumes.

J Robbins,"[4, 4]","O'Neill's last and greatest play, which was not to be produced during his lifetime because it was so personal, has made a successful transition to film.  Mainly a succession of dialogues between different members of the family, like most O'Neill the play is long and often redundant. However, this is excused by the brilliance of the language, the raw emotion, and the depth of characterization.  ""Night"" is O'Neill forgiving his family and telling them that he loves them.  It is intense, unrelenting, and painful.  However, at the same time, O'Neill wrote some scenes of comic relief, also.  There are speeches of great poetry (e.g., Edmund telling his father about his sea adventures).Katherine Hepburn is perfect in the role of Mary.  It is said that she wanted the part badly, and took a large cut in pay in order to get it.  Her quirky hand and facial movements define the character.  I was a bit disappointed with Ralph Richardson's performance.  He is a fine actor, but in this vehicle he is supposed to play an Irishman who worked hard to lose his brogue.  But in the film, he speaks with his nasal, English accent**.  Dean Stockwell is fine as the sickly Edmund who has a complex relationship with his brother, Jamie.  Jason Robards, Jr., reprises his off-Broadway triumph in the role of the dissolute, unambitious Jamie, James' eldest son.This is playwrighting at its finest.

315630,APP5MBH2BSX6I,6302484499,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[12, 13]","Playwright Eugene O'Neill is credited with single-handedly elevating the American dramatic stage play to a respectable level in the early 20th century, thanks to such timeless works as ""The Iceman Cometh,"" ""Mourning Becomes Electra,"" and ""Anna Christie.""  This autobiographical work was published long after his death, earned a posthumous Pulitzer Prize in 1957, and was filmed on a small budget in 1962 with Katharine Hepburn starring, who sought out the role with her typical vigor.The director was Sidney Lumet, whose only previous major work was his theatrical debut, ""12 Angry Men,"" with Henry Fonda.  He had also done a TV version of O'Neill's ""The Iceman Cometh"" in 1960.  Just two years after this film he made ""The Pawnbroker"" with Rod Steiger, but it was the '70s before his career warped into high gear with such great films as ""Serpico,"" ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" ""Network,"" ""Prince Of the City,"" and ""The Verdict.""  Did I mention he's one of my favorite directors?The material O'Neill provides here is heavily psychological, as he basically puts his own family on stage and peels away their outer facades, layer by layer.  From the start we see that there are conflicts in every relationship within this family consisting of the aging actor and patriarch, his fragile wife of 36 years who's never been interested in theater, O'Neill's drunkard second-rate actor of a brother, and the baby of the family (O'Neill himself), and over the course of the 3 hours we share with this most dysfunctional of groups we see them walking on eggshells, then accidentally bruising one another and profusely apologizing, and ultimately savaging one another in the throes of drug and drink.That sounds quite unappealing, but in the hands of a master like O'Neill we truly get to know these characters, their lives, their fears, their aspirations, and their souls.  And Lumet's direction, choosing to limit the film to a fairly strict stage-faithful interpretation of the material, is as striking as ever, dollying slowly into a screen-filling closeup of the characters at moments when they are ultimately being revealed or, alternately, occasionally dollying down the hallway or down to the beach to show us the characters in a wordless revelation of their loneliness.  In the later parts of the film his camera is often shooting from floor level as the characters tower over one another, dominating one another in mind, body, and soul.  Beautiful, understated work, typical of Lumet.Sir Ralph Richardson plays the aging star of stage, based on O'Neill's father, who made a career of playing ""The Count of Monte Cristo.""  His emotive performance perfectly fits such a ""Master Thespian,"" and he is as commanding a miserly patriarch as there ever was.  Hepburn's delicate and demanding performance as O'Neill's mother is a roller coaster ride that ends in the night of madness, her family spent and helpless to aid her.  Jason Robards, who reprised this role in the TV-theatre sequel ""A Moon For the Misbegotten,"" is absolutely dead on as the wasted young man who lives down to his father's expectations and bares his soul more painfully than the others.  And young Dean Stockwell shows how lazily he performed on TV's ""Quantum Leap"" many years later, here playing a nuanced and delicate character whose role often is to simply react to those around him; he's the baby of the family, the playwright as a young man who's not yet a playwright, seeing his world change for the worse right before his eyes.It's a monumental work, this play and this film.  Its title, like the best such work, is both literal and figurative.  It's likely to leave you wrung out emotionally, so be prepared; it's worth the work on the viewer's part.",5,Lumet meets O'Neill,1108080000,"02 11, 2005",2005,3715,"['Playwright', 'Eugene', ""O'Neill"", 'credited', 'single-handedly', 'elevating', 'American', 'dramatic', 'stage', 'play', 'respectable', 'level', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'thanks', 'such', 'timeless', 'works', 'Iceman', 'Cometh', 'Mourning', 'Becomes', 'Electra', 'Anna', 'Christie', 'autobiographical', 'work', 'was', 'published', 'long', 'death', 'earned', 'posthumous', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', '1957', 'was', 'filmed', 'small', 'budget', '1962', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'starring', 'who', 'sought', 'out', 'role', 'typical', 'vigor.The', 'director', 'was', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'only', 'previous', 'major', 'work', 'was', 'theatrical', 'debut', '12', 'Angry', 'Men', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'had', 'also', 'done', 'TV', 'version', ""O'Neill"", 'Iceman', 'Cometh', '1960', 'Just', 'two', 'years', 'film', 'made', 'Pawnbroker', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'was', ""'70s"", 'career', 'warped', 'high', 'gear', 'such', 'great', 'films', 'Serpico', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'Network', 'Prince', 'City', 'Verdict', 'Did', 'mention', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'material', ""O'Neill"", 'here', 'heavily', 'psychological', 'basically', 'own', 'family', 'stage', 'peels', 'away', 'outer', 'facades', 'layer', 'layer', 'start', 'see', 'are', 'conflicts', 'relationship', 'family', 'consisting', 'aging', 'actor', 'patriarch', 'fragile', 'wife', '36', 'years', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'interested', 'theater', ""O'Neill"", 'drunkard', 'second-rate', 'actor', 'brother', 'baby', 'family', ""O'Neill"", 'course', '3', 'hours', 'share', 'most', 'dysfunctional', 'groups', 'see', 'walking', 'eggshells', 'then', 'accidentally', 'bruising', 'one', 'profusely', 'apologizing', 'ultimately', 'savaging', 'one', 'throes', 'drug', 'drink.That', 'quite', 'unappealing', 'hands', 'master', ""O'Neill"", 'truly', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'lives', 'fears', 'aspirations', 'souls', 'Lumet', 'direction', 'choosing', 'limit', 'film', 'fairly', 'strict', 'stage-faithful', 'interpretation', 'material', 'as', 'striking', 'ever', 'dollying', 'slowly', 'screen-filling', 'closeup', 'characters', 'moments', 'when', 'are', 'ultimately', 'being', 'revealed', 'alternately', 'occasionally', 'dollying', 'down', 'hallway', 'down', 'beach', 'show', 'characters', 'wordless', 'revelation', 'loneliness', 'later', 'parts', 'film', 'camera', 'often', 'shooting', 'floor', 'level', 'characters', 'tower', 'one', 'dominating', 'one', 'mind', 'body', 'soul', 'Beautiful', 'understated', 'work', 'typical', 'Lumet.Sir', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'aging', 'star', 'stage', 'based', ""O'Neill"", 'father', 'who', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'Count', 'Monte', 'Cristo', 'emotive', 'performance', 'perfectly', 'Master', 'Thespian', 'commanding', 'miserly', 'patriarch', 'ever', 'was', 'Hepburn', 'delicate', 'demanding', 'performance', ""O'Neill"", 'mother', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'night', 'madness', 'family', 'spent', 'helpless', 'aid', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'who', 'reprised', 'role', 'TV-theatre', 'sequel', 'Moon', 'Misbegotten', 'absolutely', 'dead', 'wasted', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'down', 'father', 'expectations', 'soul', 'more', 'painfully', 'others', 'young', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'how', 'lazily', 'performed', 'TV', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'here', 'playing', 'nuanced', 'delicate', 'character', 'role', 'often', 'simply', 'react', 'baby', 'family', 'playwright', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'yet', 'playwright', 'seeing', 'world', 'change', 'worse', 'right', 'eyes.It', 'monumental', 'work', 'play', 'film', 'title', 'best', 'such', 'work', 'literal', 'figurative', 'likely', 'leave', 'wrung', 'out', 'emotionally', 'so', 'be', 'prepared', 'work', 'viewer', 'part']",Long Day's Journey Into Night VHS

Leave it for those who can appreciate the extreme tension and release that are created by these wonderful characters.  _A Long Day's Journey Into Night_ is an emotional descent, a painful adventure into the lives of one family who has plenty of skeletons in the closet.  Katharine Hepburn is superb playing a mother addicted to morphine, administered to her after the birth of her son, Edmund.  This event looms over the entire movie, creating tension and anger between each member of the cast.Yet, when we ask ourselves why each of the characters has drowned themselves in alcohol, an interesting notion arises.  All of them use Hepburn's character as an excuse to begin drinking again, brought on by their painful realization that she is still addicted to morphine.  And yet, I don't get the sense that anyone really wants to give up his or her own habit.  In fact, one gets the feeling that they almost hope Hepburn's character relapses so that they can continue to justify their own need.  Every character gains the audience's sympathy in this film, only to be destroyed by the memories of another character on stage.  While I agree with those who believe that this sort of film is overdone, alcohol loosening the inhibitions of those in the film so that an open and free dialogue can continue long into the night, I think that it is nevertheless a real and emotional genre.Despite all of its wonderful qualities, _A Long Day's Journey Into Night_ is certainly true to its name-long.  One gets the sense that it is being shot in real-time.  While the dialogue is engaging and effective, I think that its length will turn off many viewers.

315635,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6302484499,Ed Uyeshima,"[21, 21]","This is likely Katharine Hepburn's greatest screen performance in a career that spanned over six decades. Tackling Eugene O'Neill's morphine-addicted Mary Tyrone must have been daunting at the time, but this 1962 film version of the playwright's autobiographical masterwork is a blazing showcase for not only her formidable talent but her male co-stars as well. Set right after the turn of the last century, it follows a summer day in the life of the Tyrones, as dysfunctional a family as one could possibly imagine. Ex-actor James Tyrone Sr. is the titular head of the family, a miserly alcoholic actor whose sanctimonious attitude has his family unable to cope with their feelings in constructive ways. His wife Mary is a faded beauty defiantly denying both her condition and that of her youngest son Edmund. Edmund has just returned from a few years on the seas but has contracted tuberculosis. Older son Jamie is a failed actor, a wastrel who has become an alcoholic and resentful of his father's stinginess in not being able to send Edmund to a good sanitarium.The movie is really a series of confrontations and long recollections. As the story progresses, we learn that each of the family members, instead of bonding over Edmund's illness, is gradually retreating into private hellish worlds and that the inability to peacefully cohabitate stems from an inability to move on from events long passed. Even though they are all obviously intelligent people, they refuse to get past their disappointments, and we are left to witness the repercussions of how their choices have affected their relationships and most tragically, how their relationships have informed their choices. What makes spending three hours with this quartet worthwhile is the fact that O'Neill transcends the melodramatic aspects by honing in mercilessly on each one's strengths and frailties. He avoids the talkiness of a stage play by imbuing a sublimely lyrical use of language that captures a profound sense of beauty amid the overwhelming tragedy.Director Sidney Lumet remains faithful to the text and emphasizes the play's substantial dramatic force by focusing very specifically on the four actors. Hepburn's head-shaking was beginning around this time, and it actually feeds effectively into the character's constant sense of loss and paranoia. She has several great moments, such as Mary's giggly remembrance of her first encounter with James and the demented stupor she displays near the end as she carries her old wedding dress around. A somewhat rigid Ralph Richardson plays James Sr. with appropriate stentorian fervor, though honestly I would have liked to have seen either Fredric March, who originated the role on Broadway, or ironically Spencer Tracy play this role, especially as the play deals heavily with Irish Catholic guilt. Jason Robards has been so inextricably connected with O'Neill in the intervening years that it is no surprise to see him superbly interpret the role of Jamie with alternate flashes of fury and poignancy. As Edmund, Dean Stockwell is a revelation as the O'Neill doppelganger, the emotional core of the play who takes the family's one positive step of forgiving his father and brother for their faults in the climax. Additional credit needs to be given to cinematographer Boris Kaufman whose fluid work here makes the camera an integral part of the experience by lending depth and range to the scenes that could not have been captured onstage.

315642,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,6302484499,Jeff  Farrow,"[3, 3]","I never cared much for Katherine Hepburn's acting until she reached middle age and began her triumphal progress to a very robust old age. Her acting just got better--in part because she was given more substantial material & roles to play. I saw her on stage once. The play wasn't anything to speak of--and Hepburn had broken her leg & was confined to a wheel chair. But from the moment she rolled herself on stage the actress RADIATED. I was sitting in probably cheapest seat in the very last row of the house--and I didn't feel I was missing anything. KH filled the entire theatre with her stage presence. I know how corny this sounds, but KH had a magnetic aura.In terms of this particular film, Hepburn is certainly at her most commanding. The signs of Huntington's disease she suffered from (resulting in tremors, particularly of the head) are barely discernable. They actually fit the role in that the symptoms could pass off as part of the addictive process of the character she was portraying. I also think that LONG DAYS JOURNEY was playwright Eugene O'Neil's best work--probably because it hit so close to home. It is basically a 4-character play (5 if you include the Irish maid who represents an outsider momentarily peeking in at the most dysfunctional of dysfunctional families.)The 4 people--Father, Mother & 2 adult sons--represent 16 possibilities of familial addictive relationship--addiction, co-dependency, enabling, etc. Everyone is addicted to something; with the mother it's shooting morphine, the father is an alcoholic & egotist & the sons are both alcoholics with physical & behavioral problems. The interplay between the family is often painful to watch, but they are snared together--probably because no one else would put up with them.The Lion in WinterSuddenly, Last SummerKatharine Hepburn: Film Collection",5,Another Hepburn Triumph,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,1836,"['never', 'cared', 'much', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'acting', 'reached', 'middle', 'age', 'began', 'triumphal', 'progress', 'very', 'robust', 'old', 'age', 'acting', 'just', 'got', 'better', 'part', 'was', 'given', 'more', 'substantial', 'material', 'roles', 'play', 'saw', 'stage', 'once', 'play', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'speak', 'Hepburn', 'had', 'broken', 'leg', 'was', 'confined', 'wheel', 'chair', 'moment', 'rolled', 'stage', 'actress', 'RADIATED', 'was', 'sitting', 'probably', 'cheapest', 'seat', 'very', 'last', 'row', 'house', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'missing', 'anything', 'KH', 'filled', 'entire', 'theatre', 'stage', 'presence', 'know', 'how', 'corny', 'KH', 'had', 'magnetic', 'aura.In', 'terms', 'particular', 'film', 'Hepburn', 'certainly', 'most', 'commanding', 'signs', 'Huntington', 'disease', 'suffered', 'resulting', 'tremors', 'particularly', 'head', 'are', 'barely', 'discernable', 'actually', 'fit', 'role', 'symptoms', 'could', 'pass', 'off', 'part', 'addictive', 'process', 'character', 'was', 'portraying', 'also', 'think', 'LONG', 'DAYS', 'JOURNEY', 'was', 'playwright', 'Eugene', ""O'Neil"", 'best', 'work', 'probably', 'hit', 'so', 'close', 'home', 'basically', '4-character', 'play', '5', 'include', 'Irish', 'maid', 'who', 'outsider', 'momentarily', 'peeking', 'most', 'dysfunctional', 'dysfunctional', 'families', '4', 'people', 'Father', 'Mother', '2', 'adult', 'sons', 'represent', '16', 'possibilities', 'familial', 'addictive', 'relationship', 'addiction', 'co-dependency', 'enabling', 'etc', 'Everyone', 'addicted', 'something', 'mother', 'shooting', 'morphine', 'father', 'alcoholic', 'egotist', 'sons', 'are', 'alcoholics', 'physical', 'behavioral', 'problems', 'interplay', 'family', 'often', 'painful', 'watch', 'are', 'snared', 'together', 'probably', 'one', 'else', 'would', 'put', 'up', 'them.The', 'Lion', 'WinterSuddenly', 'Last', 'SummerKatharine', 'Hepburn', 'Film', 'Collection']",Long Day's Journey Into Night VHS

Bernabo,"[18, 18]","Eugene O'Neill finished writing &quot;Long Day's Journey Into Night&quot; in 1940, but when he died in 1951 his will specifically stated the play was not to be produced until at least 25-years after his death.  Because his widow relented and gave her permission for this &quot;play of old sorrow written in tears and blood&quot; we are left with this 1962 film and Katharine Hepburn's greatest acting performance.  I first stumbled upon this film on late night television twenty years ago and I still remember staying up and crying throughout the emotionally devastating conclusion with the camera slowly pulling back from the family sitting around the table before a stunning series of emotional close ups of the doomed Tyrones.This painfully autobiographical play is set on the long day and night in 1912 when the Tyrone family deals the news that young Edmund (Dean Stockwell) has tuberculosis.  The tragedy is compounded by the rest of the family: a father (Ralph Richardson) who is a miser, a brother (Jason Robards, Jr., repeating his stage performance) who finds solace in drink, and a mother who retreats into her addiction to morphine before the night is over.  Writing about his own family, O'Neill not only changed their last names to Tyrone but also switched Eugene with Edmund, the name of the infant brother who died.  After watching this heartbreakingly painful story you know why the playwright wanted it tucked away until he was long gone.Hepburn received her ninth Oscar nomination for her role as Mary Tyrone (the award went to Anne Bancroft for &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;), and the four actors shared the acting award for the Cannes Film Festival along with the principals of &quot;A Taste of Hone&quot; (no clue how they came to that strange pairing).  The almost 3-hour film is the complete O'Neill script (the key selling point for Hepburn in taking the role) and was shot by director Sidney Lumet in sequence in 37 days after the cast rehearsed for three weeks.  The music score is by Andre Previn and Boris Kaufman was the cinematographer of this black and white film.  O'Neill is enjoying something of a revival thanks to Kevin Spacey in &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; on Broadway, but when it comes to film this is far and away the best representation of his work.  Given that he wrote extremely long plays about the early part of the last century, it is likely we will never see a greater film version of O'Neill than &quot;Long Day's Journey Into Night.&quot;Interesting background tidbit: Hepburn tried to talk Spencer Tracy into taking the role of the father.  Tracy, who was already in failing health, turned it down, claiming it was a question of salary (Hepburn received only $25,000 for her part).  Some of Tracy's biographers, wondering how one of the greatest actors of the century would have done with one of the greatest plays, have suggested that Tracy was intimidated by the role.  Still, it is hard not to fantasize about the &quot;Long Day's Journey Into Night&quot; as a Tracy-Hepburn vehicle.",5,Hepburn's Greatest Peformance in O'Neill's Greatest Tragedy,972345600,"10 24, 2000",2000,3040,"['Eugene', ""O'Neill"", 'finished', 'writing', 'quot', 'Long', 'Day', 'Journey', 'Into', 'Night', 'quot', '1940', 'when', 'died', '1951', 'will', 'specifically', 'stated', 'play', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'produced', 'least', '25-years', 'death', 'widow', 'relented', 'gave', 'permission', 'quot', 'play', 'old', 'sorrow', 'written', 'tears', 'blood', 'quot', 'are', 'left', '1962', 'film', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'greatest', 'acting', 'performance', 'first', 'stumbled', 'film', 'late', 'night', 'television', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'remember', 'staying', 'up', 'crying', 'emotionally', 'devastating', 'conclusion', 'camera', 'slowly', 'pulling', 'back', 'family', 'sitting', 'table', 'stunning', 'series', 'emotional', 'close', 'ups', 'doomed', 'Tyrones.This', 'painfully', 'autobiographical', 'play', 'set', 'long', 'day', 'night', '1912', 'when', 'Tyrone', 'family', 'news', 'young', 'Edmund', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'tuberculosis', 'tragedy', 'compounded', 'rest', 'family', 'father', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'who', 'miser', 'brother', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Jr.', 'repeating', 'stage', 'performance', 'who', 'solace', 'drink', 'mother', 'who', 'addiction', 'morphine', 'night', 'Writing', 'own', 'family', ""O'Neill"", 'not', 'only', 'changed', 'last', 'names', 'Tyrone', 'also', 'switched', 'Eugene', 'Edmund', 'name', 'infant', 'brother', 'who', 'died', 'watching', 'heartbreakingly', 'painful', 'story', 'know', 'why', 'playwright', 'wanted', 'tucked', 'away', 'was', 'long', 'gone.Hepburn', 'received', 'ninth', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'role', 'Mary', 'Tyrone', 'award', 'went', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'quot', 'Miracle', 'Worker', 'quot', 'four', 'actors', 'shared', 'acting', 'award', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'principals', 'quot', 'A', 'Taste', 'Hone', 'quot', 'clue', 'how', 'came', 'strange', 'pairing', 'almost', '3-hour', 'film', 'complete', ""O'Neill"", 'script', 'key', 'selling', 'point', 'Hepburn', 'taking', 'role', 'was', 'shot', 'director', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'sequence', '37', 'days', 'cast', 'rehearsed', 'three', 'weeks', 'music', 'score', 'Andre', 'Previn', 'Boris', 'Kaufman', 'was', 'cinematographer', 'black', 'white', 'film', ""O'Neill"", 'enjoying', 'something', 'revival', 'thanks', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'quot', 'Iceman', 'Cometh', 'quot', 'Broadway', 'when', 'film', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'representation', 'work', 'Given', 'wrote', 'extremely', 'long', 'plays', 'early', 'part', 'last', 'century', 'likely', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'greater', 'film', 'version', ""O'Neill"", 'quot', 'Long', 'Day', 'Journey', 'Into', 'Night.', 'quot', 'Interesting', 'background', 'tidbit', 'Hepburn', 'tried', 'talk', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'taking', 'role', 'father', 'Tracy', 'who', 'was', 'already', 'failing', 'health', 'turned', 'down', 'claiming', 'was', 'question', 'salary', 'Hepburn', 'received', 'only', '25,000', 'part', 'Tracy', 'biographers', 'wondering', 'how', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'century', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'one', 'greatest', 'plays', 'have', 'suggested', 'Tracy', 'was', 'intimidated', 'role', 'Still', 'hard', 'not', 'fantasize', 'quot', 'Long', 'Day', 'Journey', 'Into', 'Night', 'quot', 'Tracy-Hepburn', 'vehicle']",Long Day's Journey Into Night VHS

Turning it into a film took a lot of courage since this is a play of internal struggle and there is very little to ""see"" in terms of action. This is a series of conversations between family members, all of whom are tortured and who are completely unable to deal with each other's failures and/or shortcomings.Rightfully, many reviewers have lauded Katherine Hepburn's and Ralph Richardson's performances as the parents of two adult sons. They are masterful performances. And certainly Jason Robards, Jr.  established himself as a premier interpreter of O'Neill with his interpretation of Jamie, the older son. I think Dean Stockwell's performance is often underrated. Since the character is less well defined in the text, he had to draw his character from the other characters interactions with him. This is extremely difficult to do and yet he is the focus of the family on that particular Long Day. He is to be commended for providing a strong anchor for the others to pull and push on. When Stockwell as Edmund says ""Stammering is the native eloquence of us fog people,"" you truly understand how deeply lost he is in a family of lost souls.This is a wonderfully moody work, filmed with great care and precision. The music is haunting and performed by a solo piano rather than a full orchestra. The single voice of the piano adds to the emptiness of the family and their inability to face any of their demons with resolve.Not everyone will enjoy this film. It is sad, depressing, black and white, no great action, and incredibly long, but I recommend it to everyone with an interest in family dynamics, brilliant acting, remarkable writing, and/or creative film-making.",5,Brilliant on all levels,1103932800,"12 25, 2004",2004,1797,"['text', ""O'Neill"", 'play', 'greatest', 'works', 'potentially', 'greatest', 'American', 'play', '20th', 'Century', 'Turning', 'film', 'took', 'lot', 'courage', 'play', 'internal', 'struggle', 'very', 'little', 'see', 'terms', 'action', 'series', 'conversations', 'family', 'members', 'whom', 'are', 'tortured', 'who', 'are', 'completely', 'unable', 'deal', 'other', 'failures', 'and/or', 'shortcomings.Rightfully', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'lauded', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'performances', 'parents', 'two', 'adult', 'sons', 'are', 'masterful', 'performances', 'certainly', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Jr.', 'established', 'premier', 'interpreter', ""O'Neill"", 'interpretation', 'Jamie', 'older', 'son', 'think', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'performance', 'often', 'underrated', 'character', 'less', 'well', 'defined', 'text', 'had', 'draw', 'character', 'other', 'characters', 'interactions', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'do', 'yet', 'focus', 'family', 'particular', 'Long', 'Day', 'be', 'commended', 'providing', 'strong', 'anchor', 'others', 'pull', 'push', 'When', 'Stockwell', 'Edmund', 'Stammering', 'native', 'eloquence', 'fog', 'people', 'truly', 'understand', 'how', 'deeply', 'lost', 'family', 'lost', 'souls.This', 'wonderfully', 'moody', 'work', 'filmed', 'great', 'care', 'precision', 'music', 'haunting', 'performed', 'solo', 'piano', 'rather', 'full', 'orchestra', 'single', 'voice', 'piano', 'emptiness', 'family', 'inability', 'face', 'demons', 'resolve.Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'sad', 'depressing', 'black', 'white', 'great', 'action', 'incredibly', 'long', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'interest', 'family', 'dynamics', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'remarkable', 'writing', 'and/or', 'creative', 'film-making']",Long Day's Journey Into Night VHS

My negative impressions were with the script.  I have enjoyed Eugene O'Neill's plays but confess that, like Tennessee Williams, I'm not inspired by his work.  In ""Long Day's Journey"", the aspect that confounded me the most was the number of times that different actors cursed a fellow family member and reconciled within the next 30 seconds.  If these charactors merely learned to count to ten before expressing their thoughts, this could have been a short three act play.  This self-induced emotional roller-coaster reminded me of a boss or two that I had in the past.  From them I learned to disregard both praise and criticism when displayed arbitrarily.  I guess this aspect made me tend to disregard the emotions on display in ""Long Day's Journey"".  On the other had, the cast was certainly up to the task of acting out those emotions.  Each of the four main characters had his or her turn with their emotional outbursts.  Katherine Hepburn probably stood out the most with her scenes and it's surprizing that hers was the only Oscar nomination to come out of this film.What is the point of this play?  Well, my take on it is that it is the story of how a family of four disintergrates by each following their own path towards destruction.  The irony is how they had the power to reinforce each other but chose the opposite approach.  I suppose that is the explanation for the frequent emotional roller-coasters that frustrated me.  O'Neill showed us that each character was both devil and angel to his family members.  Where was the strength to come from with a supporting cast like that?  Ironically, in this autobiographical play, the person with the gravest challenge ended up with the best outcome.  Of course, that wasn't in the play or movie; it was in the life of the playwright.  Depending on how autobiographical this play actually is, it may go a long way in explaining O'Neill's pessimistic outlook on life.",5,A Long Dysfunctional Collapse in Oblivion,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,2045,"['came', 'away', 'viewing', 'Long', 'Day', 'Journey', 'Night', 'impression', 'had', 'seen', 'masterful', 'performance', 'negative', 'impressions', 'were', 'script', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Eugene', ""O'Neill"", 'plays', 'confess', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', ""'m"", 'not', 'inspired', 'work', 'Long', 'Day', 'Journey', 'aspect', 'confounded', 'most', 'was', 'number', 'times', 'different', 'actors', 'cursed', 'fellow', 'family', 'member', 'reconciled', 'next', '30', 'seconds', 'charactors', 'merely', 'learned', 'count', 'ten', 'expressing', 'thoughts', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'short', 'three', 'act', 'play', 'self-induced', 'emotional', 'roller-coaster', 'reminded', 'boss', 'two', 'had', 'past', 'learned', 'disregard', 'praise', 'criticism', 'when', 'displayed', 'arbitrarily', 'guess', 'aspect', 'made', 'tend', 'disregard', 'emotions', 'display', 'Long', 'Day', 'Journey', 'other', 'had', 'cast', 'was', 'certainly', 'up', 'task', 'acting', 'out', 'emotions', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'had', 'turn', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'probably', 'stood', 'out', 'most', 'scenes', 'surprizing', 'hers', 'was', 'only', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'come', 'point', 'play', 'Well', 'take', 'story', 'how', 'family', 'four', 'disintergrates', 'following', 'own', 'path', 'towards', 'destruction', 'irony', 'how', 'had', 'power', 'reinforce', 'other', 'chose', 'opposite', 'approach', 'suppose', 'explanation', 'frequent', 'emotional', 'roller-coasters', 'frustrated', ""O'Neill"", 'showed', 'character', 'was', 'devil', 'angel', 'family', 'members', 'Where', 'was', 'strength', 'come', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Ironically', 'autobiographical', 'play', 'person', 'gravest', 'challenge', 'ended', 'up', 'best', 'outcome', 'course', 'was', ""n't"", 'play', 'movie', 'was', 'life', 'playwright', 'Depending', 'how', 'autobiographical', 'play', 'actually', 'may', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'explaining', ""O'Neill"", 'pessimistic', 'outlook', 'life']",Long Day's Journey Into Night VHS

Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[13, 14]","No doubt this filming of Eugene O'Neill's epic play will not appeal to everyone (though there are suggestions of drugs, sex & violence...) This is, in effect, an exact filming of O'Neill's play, masterfully directed by a younger Sidney Lumet (Network, Murder on the Orient Express, etc.), and his trademark of generous close-ups is haunting. This is apt, since the entire cast won top acting honors at Cannes. Indeed, aside from the autobiographical train of events, the acting is, without exception, brilliant. This is one of Robards' first film roles, as well as Stockwell, and their performances are multi-layered and mesmerizing. Also, Ralph Richardson's role fits him like a glove. The most remarkable performance is from Katherine Hepburn...as a morphine addict? Wow! I remember reading interviews years ago where Hepburn admitted that she was scared to death of the utter complexity of the role. She was at a point in her career where she was worried that no one would take her seriously, or that she'd fall short in creating any of the many facets of the character. Well, it's complete! Affection, cynicism, duality, suspicion, and her deep trips into her past, not to mention that she's aware that her life's gone to hell...it's overwhelming. The play/film is episodic, but this is OK because it gives wonderful interaction among all characters (even Jeanne Barr, as the goofy housekeeper). It's all very atmospheric and quite profound, thanks to Lumet's understanding of his material. Andre Previn's unobtrusive score properly conveys ""dysfunction"" when necessary. At three hours, the time flies by, thanks to impeccable production values, and acting, captured on film, that any true aficianado will cherish. Sure, it's artsy, but it would be hard to present O'Neill any other way. I usually prefer widescreen, but the close-ups may actually benefit from this full-screen version.

Director Sidney Lumet uses the text of the play itself as his script, with very little embellishment or alteration.  The film maintains the claustrophobic nature of the original, with most of the action taking place in the drawing room of a summer house on Long Island.The story deals with one day in the life of a singularly dysfunctional family:  James Tyrone (Ralph Richardson) is a miserly, washed-up actor living in the glory days of his past; his wife Mary (Katherine Hepburn) is a middle-aged woman addicted to morphine; their older son, Jamie (Jason Robards, Jr.) is an alcoholic; and the younger son, Edmund (Dean Stockwell) is a guilt-ridden young man suffering from tuberculosis.The entire cast is superb, but the standout is Hepburn.  Giving one of the best performances in her long and distinguished career, Hepburn is in turn maddening, pathetic and, finally, tragic.

It seemed depressing to me from the very beginning, and seemed to slide you farther and farther down into the hopelessness of their lives as the film went on. I am not a fan of films that are so dark, so sad, so hopeless...it is no joy to watch a dysfunctional family such as this. They are a strange bunch...at times seeming to care for each other and saying a kind or loving word to each other, but in the next breath they are saying very hurtful words that cut to the heart. I could not believe how this pattern of &quot;I love you I hate you&quot; dialog went on and on in the movie. Obviously they are all deeply troubled people, and unable to really help each other. I did not care for the swearing in the movie, or all the times the name of God was used in vain. I must say I did not really LIKE this film at all...it was too hopeless, and for it to end them no better off than they were in the beginning, well you just sit there and wonder, &quot;What was the purpose of telling us this story?&quot; You cannot feel anything but sadness at their hopelessness, you are wanting to do nothing but to cry for this family.While I did not like the story, I will say the actors did a good job of portraying their characters...Katherine Hepburn stood out to me most of all; she seemed the most tragic figure in the family. This film was definately very real...there are people who do function like this in their relations to one another. Yet personally, I like to see a film where in the end the characters have grown or have learned something to better themselves...in other words I prefer to feel some hope for them in the end. It is not a film I would ever watch again.",3,A dark and depressing movie,1033948800,"10 7, 2002",2002,2039,"['saw', 'movie', 'library', 'shelf', 'so', 'checked', 'out', 'did', 'so', 'moment', 'am', 'studying', 'life', 'Fredric', 'March', 'was', 'one', 'plays', 'performed', 'theatre', 'career', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'play', 'was', 'about', 'had', 'played', 'role', 'father', 'stage', 'version.Anyway', 'LONG', 'film', 'had', 'watch', 'two', 'evenings', 'seemed', 'depressing', 'very', 'beginning', 'seemed', 'slide', 'farther', 'farther', 'down', 'hopelessness', 'lives', 'film', 'went', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'dark', 'so', 'sad', 'so', 'hopeless', 'joy', 'watch', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'such', 'are', 'strange', 'bunch', 'times', 'seeming', 'care', 'other', 'saying', 'kind', 'loving', 'word', 'other', 'next', 'breath', 'are', 'saying', 'very', 'hurtful', 'words', 'cut', 'heart', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'pattern', 'quot', 'love', 'hate', 'quot', 'dialog', 'went', 'movie', 'Obviously', 'are', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'people', 'unable', 'really', 'help', 'other', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'swearing', 'movie', 'times', 'name', 'God', 'was', 'used', 'vain', 'must', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'hopeless', 'end', 'better', 'off', 'were', 'beginning', 'well', 'just', 'sit', 'there', 'wonder', 'quot', 'What', 'was', 'purpose', 'telling', 'story', 'quot', 'can', 'not', 'feel', 'anything', 'sadness', 'hopelessness', 'are', 'wanting', 'do', 'nothing', 'cry', 'family.While', 'did', 'not', 'story', 'will', 'say', 'actors', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'characters', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'stood', 'out', 'most', 'seemed', 'most', 'tragic', 'figure', 'family', 'film', 'was', 'definately', 'very', 'real', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'function', 'relations', 'one', 'personally', 'like', 'see', 'film', 'where', 'end', 'characters', 'have', 'grown', 'have', 'learned', 'something', 'better', 'other', 'words', 'prefer', 'feel', 'hope', 'end', 'not', 'film', 'would', 'ever', 'watch', 'again']",Long Day's Journey Into Night VHS

This adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's play is dry and slow moving. It's a slow building sizzle of failed lives and interactions exploding and unraveling between well intentioned family members. I would compare its dynamics to 'Relfections In A Golden Eye' (Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor, Julie Harris) in its pace and temperament.Everyone needs to be in analysis. Everyone is love-starved and in need of some attention. Everyone uses the failings of others to avoid the failings of their own lives. So we drown in the drama of people and families, like us, who can't extract themselves from the web of their inability to take control of their lives. We see how ineffectual and pointless we become when we depend upon others to fill in the black holes of our emptiness and sense of helplessness.One has to be in the mood to watch 'Long Day's Journey Into Night.' It's demanding and draining. Yet I always find it a fascinating and insightful viewing. The tragedy of the 'American Dream' and its incompatibility with real life is probably the lesson here. We fill our heads with false expectations, then insulate ourselves from our innate needs and responsibility for our own lives, and end up an unnatural and pathetic shadow of what we might have been.I've never seen Olivier's version, so I can't compare one to the other. Each film has those who hail one or the other, sometimes at the expense of the other, as the best version. I'll probably buy it down the road so that I know. I think the film good enough to spend the money on a second version.Like 'Reflections In A Golden Eye,' 'Long Day's Journey Into Night' remains one of my favorite films. I really appreciate the human drama of dealing with our shortcomings and stifled desires. I highly recommend both films, and hope to see ""Reflections' on dvd soon.",4,The quiet desperation of an American family who focuses on,1095984000,"09 24, 2004",2004,1917,"['one', 'shortcoming', 'never', 'long', 'hard', 'look', 'mirror', 'self-introspection', 'adaptation', 'Eugene', ""O'Neill"", 'play', 'dry', 'slow', 'moving', 'slow', 'building', 'sizzle', 'failed', 'lives', 'interactions', 'exploding', 'unraveling', 'well', 'intentioned', 'family', 'members', 'would', 'compare', 'dynamics', ""'Relfections"", 'A', 'Golden', 'Eye', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'pace', 'temperament.Everyone', 'needs', 'be', 'analysis', 'Everyone', 'love-starved', 'need', 'attention', 'Everyone', 'failings', 'others', 'avoid', 'failings', 'own', 'lives', 'drown', 'drama', 'people', 'families', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'extract', 'web', 'inability', 'take', 'control', 'lives', 'see', 'how', 'ineffectual', 'pointless', 'become', 'when', 'depend', 'others', 'fill', 'black', 'holes', 'emptiness', 'sense', 'helplessness.One', 'be', 'mood', 'watch', ""'Long"", 'Day', 'Journey', 'Into', 'Night', 'demanding', 'draining', 'always', 'find', 'fascinating', 'insightful', 'viewing', 'tragedy', ""'American"", 'Dream', 'incompatibility', 'real', 'life', 'probably', 'lesson', 'here', 'fill', 'heads', 'false', 'expectations', 'then', 'insulate', 'ourselves', 'innate', 'needs', 'responsibility', 'own', 'lives', 'end', 'up', 'unnatural', 'pathetic', 'shadow', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Olivier', 'version', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'one', 'other', 'film', 'who', 'hail', 'one', 'other', 'sometimes', 'expense', 'other', 'best', 'version', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'buy', 'down', 'road', 'know', 'think', 'film', 'good', 'enough', 'spend', 'money', 'second', 'version.Like', ""'Reflections"", 'A', 'Golden', 'Eye', ""'Long"", 'Day', 'Journey', 'Into', 'Night', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'really', 'appreciate', 'human', 'drama', 'dealing', 'shortcomings', 'stifled', 'desires', 'highly', 'recommend', 'films', 'hope', 'see', 'Reflections', 'dvd', 'soon']",Long Day's Journey Into Night VHS
