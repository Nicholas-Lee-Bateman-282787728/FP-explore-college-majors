I don't know if this is because it's a full season (as opposed to the shortened first one), or because I've gotten past the characters' (especially Turtle's and Drama's) loutishness, and now I can see the humor for the trees.Or maybe the writing improved just a smidgen, and that's all it took for this show to deliver on its potential? Anyway, the storylines now click, the banter and comedy flow naturally (none of the ""trying too hard"" syndrome I noticed first time out), and the actors are delivering the goods. Much has been made of Jeremy Piven nailing his role of Ari, but the supporting cast (especially the guy who plays Lloyd, Ari's secretary) are really hitting their marks too.",4,Hug It Out and Watch This Series Improve,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,801,"[""'re"", 'enjoyable', 'found', 'enjoying', 'second', 'season', 'ENTOURAGE', 'much', 'more', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'full', 'season', 'opposed', 'shortened', 'first', 'one', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'characters', 'especially', 'Turtle', 'Drama', 'loutishness', 'now', 'can', 'see', 'humor', 'trees.Or', 'maybe', 'writing', 'improved', 'just', 'smidgen', 'took', 'show', 'deliver', 'potential', 'Anyway', 'storylines', 'now', 'click', 'banter', 'comedy', 'flow', 'naturally', 'none', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'syndrome', 'noticed', 'first', 'time', 'out', 'actors', 'are', 'delivering', 'goods', 'Much', 'been', 'made', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'nailing', 'role', 'Ari', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'guy', 'who', 'Lloyd', 'Ari', 'secretary', 'are', 'really', 'hitting', 'marks', 'too']",Entourage - The Complete First Two Seasons
981417,A1725KPO7A5ULX,B000F1IQHS,"Jesse Kornbluth ""Head Butler""","[1, 2]","If you're so inclined, 'Entourage' can be easy to resist.A posse of callow youth from Queens moves to Los Angeles, the better to sponge off the Friend Who Made It --- that is, if being a disposable pretty boy in B-list movies is your idea of making it. But Vincent Chase is never seen at work. He seems to be on an endless vacation, going to parties and scoring chicks and smoking dope. Meanwhile, his pals are working him. Eric (""E"") capitalizes on their grade school friendship to become Vince's manager. Johnnie, known as ""Drama"", tries to revive his acting career, but as Vince's older half-brother, is most useful as a breakfast cook. Rounding out the entourage is Turtle, who functions as a driver and house manager when not toking up. The most interesting character is Vince's agent, Ari Gold, who either suffers from Tourette's or is just a nasty piece of work (or both).My wife started watching 'Entourage' and, soon enough, she had a grand theory of a new style in television: shows like 'House' and 'Entourage' lure you in precisely because they're built around characters who are mean and anti-social. Truth is a weapon for them. They never use a velvet globe when an iron fist is handy. We like these characters, she told me, because they give themselves permission to say anything. Authority? They don't fear it. Confrontation? Bring it.Yummy theory --- who doesn't like a little obnoxiousness now and then? So I watched a recent episode of 'Entourage'. Then I went back and watched every episode from the just-ended season and the DVDs of seasons one and two. And I am here today, chastened, to say that 'Entourage' is the funniest, deadliest, most satisfying television I have watched in donkey's years.Is it shallow? No. It plumbs the depths of shallow, which, in a shallow culture like ours, is as deep as you need to go. That is, I don't see Vincent as a weak pretty boy; I see him as naturally wise. He's catnip to women, but he doesn't lie to them. He's detached --- he cares about his career, but he's generally indifferent to the outcome. He's both in the world and not of it; he understands better than anyone that Hollywood is a game. His strategy is simply to enjoy it while it lasts.Like my wife, I have a theory of the show: Vince is the Buddha, and his entourage is his sangha. He provides little teaching exercises that help them grow. He provides the same service for Ari Gold, who is forced, by Vince's example, to go against his nature and tell the truth --- to be a friend, not just a talent salesmen.I'm taking the show seriously, as I think you will, if you surrender to it and, as we have done, watch three or four half-hour episodes a night. But the best way to sell you on it is probably to lean on the humor --- which is considerable. For this is the fastest-paced show possible; the whip-smart dialogue cuts like a lash. (It's HBO: R-rated TV --- that is, in a calm moment.)Ari Gold is the king of this banter. He's the ultimate insider, possessor of all knowledge, and how best to use it to his advantage. To him, Eric is ""Pizza Boy,"" because his last job was managing a Sbarro's in New York. Meetings end with Ari saying, ""Let's hug it out, bitch.""Ari's relationship with Vince and Eric is nothing less than a comic tutorial on the inner workings on Hollywood. Although he's only got an independent film to show for himself, Vince wants to be a serious actor --- he's not eager to be the hero of ""Aquaman,"" a surefire summer blockbuster.Vince buys Marlon Brando's old house. But he still has no job. Now he needs ""Aquaman."" Which now has a director: James Cameron. Who might not be willing to go to Sundance to see Vince's low-budget movie.These plot points, you see, are minute. But very important in the game. 'Entourage' moves as fast as tennis; the serves come in at 140 miles an hour. And, delightfully, they get smashed back. At the end of the just completed season, Vince fires Ari Gold. In real life, that episode ran on the very night of the Emmys --- when Piven won the Best Supporting Actor award. Think he won't be back in season four?I'll be watching. And if you let these DVDs into your house, so, I bet, will you.",5,"the funniest, deadliest, most satisfying television in donkey's years.",1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,4171,"[""'re"", 'so', 'inclined', 'can', 'be', 'easy', 'resist.A', 'posse', 'callow', 'youth', 'Queens', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'better', 'sponge', 'off', 'Friend', 'Who', 'Made', 'being', 'disposable', 'pretty', 'boy', 'B-list', 'movies', 'idea', 'making', 'Vincent', 'Chase', 'never', 'seen', 'work', 'be', 'endless', 'vacation', 'going', 'parties', 'scoring', 'chicks', 'smoking', 'dope', 'Meanwhile', 'pals', 'are', 'working', 'Eric', 'E', 'grade', 'school', 'friendship', 'become', 'Vince', 'manager', 'Johnnie', 'known', 'Drama', 'revive', 'acting', 'career', 'Vince', 'older', 'half-brother', 'most', 'useful', 'breakfast', 'cook', 'Rounding', 'out', 'entourage', 'Turtle', 'who', 'driver', 'house', 'manager', 'when', 'not', 'toking', 'up', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'Vince', 'agent', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'who', 'suffers', 'Tourette', 'just', 'nasty', 'piece', 'work', '.My', 'wife', 'started', 'watching', ""'Entourage"", 'soon', 'enough', 'had', 'grand', 'theory', 'new', 'style', 'television', 'shows', ""'House"", 'lure', 'precisely', ""'re"", 'built', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'mean', 'anti-social', 'Truth', 'weapon', 'never', 'use', 'velvet', 'globe', 'when', 'iron', 'fist', 'handy', 'characters', 'told', 'give', 'permission', 'say', 'anything', 'Authority', 'do', ""n't"", 'fear', 'Confrontation', 'Bring', 'it.Yummy', 'theory', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'little', 'obnoxiousness', 'now', 'then', 'So', 'watched', 'recent', 'episode', ""'Entourage"", 'Then', 'went', 'back', 'watched', 'episode', 'just-ended', 'season', 'DVDs', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'am', 'here', 'today', 'chastened', 'say', ""'Entourage"", 'funniest', 'deadliest', 'most', 'satisfying', 'television', 'have', 'watched', 'donkey', 'years.Is', 'shallow', 'depths', 'shallow', 'shallow', 'culture', 'ours', 'as', 'deep', 'need', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Vincent', 'weak', 'pretty', 'boy', 'see', 'naturally', 'wise', 'catnip', 'women', ""n't"", 'lie', 'detached', 'career', 'generally', 'indifferent', 'outcome', 'world', 'not', 'better', 'anyone', 'Hollywood', 'game', 'strategy', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'wife', 'have', 'theory', 'show', 'Vince', 'Buddha', 'entourage', 'sangha', 'little', 'teaching', 'exercises', 'help', 'grow', 'same', 'service', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'who', 'forced', 'Vince', 'example', 'go', 'nature', 'tell', 'truth', 'be', 'friend', 'not', 'just', 'talent', 'salesmen.I', ""'m"", 'taking', 'show', 'seriously', 'think', 'will', 'surrender', 'have', 'done', 'watch', 'three', 'four', 'half-hour', 'episodes', 'night', 'best', 'way', 'sell', 'probably', 'lean', 'humor', 'considerable', 'fastest-paced', 'show', 'possible', 'whip-smart', 'dialogue', 'cuts', 'lash', 'HBO', 'R-rated', 'TV', 'calm', 'moment', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'king', 'banter', 'ultimate', 'insider', 'possessor', 'knowledge', 'how', 'best', 'use', 'advantage', 'Eric', 'Pizza', 'Boy', 'last', 'job', 'was', 'managing', 'Sbarro', 'New', 'York', 'Meetings', 'end', 'Ari', 'saying', 'Let', 'hug', 'out', 'bitch', 'Ari', 'relationship', 'Vince', 'Eric', 'nothing', 'less', 'comic', 'tutorial', 'inner', 'workings', 'Hollywood', 'only', 'got', 'independent', 'film', 'show', 'Vince', 'be', 'serious', 'actor', 'not', 'eager', 'be', 'hero', 'Aquaman', 'surefire', 'summer', 'blockbuster.Vince', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'old', 'house', 'still', 'job', 'Now', 'Aquaman', 'now', 'director', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Who', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'willing', 'go', 'Sundance', 'see', 'Vince', 'low-budget', 'movie.These', 'plot', 'points', 'see', 'are', 'minute', 'very', 'important', 'game', ""'Entourage"", 'moves', 'as', 'fast', 'tennis', 'serves', 'come', '140', 'miles', 'hour', 'delightfully', 'get', 'smashed', 'back', 'end', 'just', 'completed', 'season', 'Vince', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'real', 'life', 'episode', 'ran', 'very', 'night', 'Emmys', 'when', 'Piven', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'award', 'Think', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'back', 'season', 'four', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'let', 'DVDs', 'house', 'bet', 'will']",Entourage - The Complete First Two Seasons
981418,AZ2K08MNJFR16,B000F1IQHS,"N. Chiemelu ""movie slave""","[1, 1]","Let me start off by saying that Entourage is currently my favorite show to watch.  You don't have to live in Hollywood or be in the business to appreciate the rapid-fire banter and acid-tongued humour of mostly soulless, bottom-line crazy, image obsessed actors and the agents, publicists, managers and hangers-on who indulge them.As a huge fan of Sex and the City, I immediately got hooked on this show not just for its intelligent blend/balance of humour and pathos (none of whom do it better than Jeremy Piven and the extremely underrated Kevin Dillon) but much like Sex and the City, it is a show about a fantasy world for 4 people who go through so much, get screwed by so many but will always have each other.  The family bond between Vince, E, Drama and Turtle (I love that we don't know his real name) is what drives the show and keeps it grounded no matter how crazy things get.  No one anticipated the show's return for Season 3 more than I and it didn't disappoint.The DVD, especially for Season 2, however, did.  The great thing about Entourage is that it is such a ""behind-the-scenes"" show.  Not only giving you a behind the scenes look at Hollywood and the business that is Hollywood but also because the writers are so great at creating backstories to just about every character without actually telling you what they are.  I was so hoping that the DVD for Season 2 would reveal how they managed to get this actor to guest star or what funny/crazy/scary story happened when they shot on such and such location but instead we got nothing.  No audio commentaries, no deleted scenes or alternate endings.  No footage of Johnny Drama's previous guest spots (I mean, come on, who isn't dying to see him playing the bulimic pedophile on the Commish).  There are so many episodes of Season 2 that I would have loved to have known more about but all we get are the Mark Wahlberg sessions, which a) I had already seen on HBO On Demand and b) weren't that interesting because we don't really learn more about the show and c) Mark Wahlberg comes off as a bit of a douchebag.I would have loved audio commentary on Chinatown, if not for the last 2 minutes alone and because I love Asian cinema.  How could they not have Chris Henchy, one of the writers of the show, comment on Blueballs Lagoon which guest starred his real life wife, Brooke Shields?!  James Cameron, one of the biggest directors in Hollywood, does a recurring guest spot and no one has anything to say about it?  Mandy Moore plays a huge role and we are left wondering why they decided to give Vince a real relationship, why Mandy Moore (I felt it was a bit of an odd choice) and why did she refuse to come back in the 3rd season and they basically act like she never existed.  You would think a writing staff of men would have something to say about shooting at the Playboy Mansion (Aquamansion, great episode, with great scenes by Ralph Macchio and Pauly Shore) or at Sundance or at a real Lakers game.I was really let down with the lack of extras in the DVD, especially with the lack of audio commentary.  Hopefully, they will beef it up for Season 3.Not to deter anyone from watching the show, this is one of the best written shows on television.  If you loved Sex and the City and you are not watching this show then you are truly missing out.  Networks have tried to emulate the magic that was SATC (cough, Heather Graham, cough) but none have come close.  That is because SATC already has an heir to the throne and Entourage is it.  People are just fooled because the show is about 4 men instead of 4 women and is in LA, not New York.  And if you have not discovered the wonder that is Kevin Dillon...I mean, I never even knew that Matt Dillon had a brother until this show!  Kevin Dillon's Johnny Drama is probably one of the funniest, smartest and most complex characters written on television to date.  He is absurd, self-centered, pathetic, self-conscious, puerile, weathered, smart, stupid and still a very real human being.  Dillon manages to take the most ridiculous character and fill him with so many nuances that Drama can go from one extreme to the next in a matter of seconds (and he often does) and you still totally buy it.  I could watch Dillon act for hours, he's that good and while I love Jeremey Piven, I have to say if anyone should be nominated for and win an Emmy, it should be Dillon.I'm giving the DVD boxset 4 out of 5 stars.  The show itself gets 5 out of 5 but the DVD gets 3 out of 5 because of lack of extras.",4,"Great Show, Mediocre DVD",1161388800,"10 21, 2006",2006,4514,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'Entourage', 'currently', 'favorite', 'show', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'live', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'business', 'appreciate', 'rapid-fire', 'banter', 'acid-tongued', 'humour', 'mostly', 'soulless', 'bottom-line', 'crazy', 'image', 'obsessed', 'actors', 'agents', 'publicists', 'managers', 'hangers-on', 'who', 'indulge', 'huge', 'fan', 'Sex', 'City', 'immediately', 'got', 'hooked', 'show', 'not', 'just', 'intelligent', 'blend/balance', 'humour', 'pathos', 'none', 'whom', 'do', 'better', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'extremely', 'underrated', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'much', 'Sex', 'City', 'show', 'fantasy', 'world', '4', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'so', 'much', 'get', 'screwed', 'so', 'many', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'other', 'family', 'bond', 'Vince', 'E', 'Drama', 'Turtle', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'real', 'name', 'what', 'show', 'grounded', 'matter', 'how', 'crazy', 'things', 'get', 'one', 'anticipated', 'show', 'return', 'Season', '3', 'more', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint.The', 'DVD', 'especially', 'Season', '2', 'however', 'did', 'great', 'thing', 'Entourage', 'such', 'behind-the-scenes', 'show', 'Not', 'only', 'giving', 'scenes', 'look', 'Hollywood', 'business', 'Hollywood', 'also', 'writers', 'are', 'so', 'great', 'creating', 'backstories', 'just', 'character', 'actually', 'telling', 'what', 'are', 'was', 'so', 'hoping', 'DVD', 'Season', '2', 'would', 'reveal', 'how', 'managed', 'get', 'actor', 'guest', 'star', 'what', 'funny/crazy/scary', 'story', 'happened', 'when', 'shot', 'such', 'such', 'location', 'instead', 'got', 'nothing', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'endings', 'footage', 'Johnny', 'Drama', 'previous', 'guest', 'spots', 'mean', 'come', 'who', ""n't"", 'dying', 'see', 'playing', 'bulimic', 'pedophile', 'Commish', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'known', 'more', 'get', 'are', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'sessions', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'HBO', 'Demand', 'b', 'were', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'learn', 'more', 'show', 'c', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'off', 'bit', 'douchebag.I', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Chinatown', 'not', 'last', '2', 'minutes', 'alone', 'love', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'How', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'Chris', 'Henchy', 'one', 'writers', 'show', 'comment', 'Blueballs', 'Lagoon', 'guest', 'starred', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'James', 'Cameron', 'one', 'biggest', 'directors', 'Hollywood', 'recurring', 'guest', 'spot', 'one', 'anything', 'say', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'huge', 'role', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'decided', 'give', 'Vince', 'real', 'relationship', 'why', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'felt', 'was', 'bit', 'odd', 'choice', 'why', 'did', 'refuse', 'come', 'back', '3rd', 'season', 'basically', 'act', 'never', 'existed', 'would', 'think', 'writing', 'staff', 'men', 'would', 'have', 'something', 'say', 'shooting', 'Playboy', 'Mansion', 'Aquamansion', 'great', 'episode', 'great', 'scenes', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'Pauly', 'Shore', 'Sundance', 'real', 'Lakers', 'game.I', 'was', 'really', 'let', 'down', 'lack', 'extras', 'DVD', 'especially', 'lack', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'beef', 'up', 'Season', '3.Not', 'deter', 'anyone', 'watching', 'show', 'one', 'best', 'written', 'television', 'loved', 'Sex', 'City', 'are', 'not', 'watching', 'show', 'then', 'are', 'truly', 'missing', 'out', 'Networks', 'have', 'tried', 'emulate', 'magic', 'was', 'SATC', 'cough', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'cough', 'none', 'have', 'come', 'close', 'SATC', 'already', 'heir', 'throne', 'Entourage', 'People', 'are', 'just', 'fooled', 'show', '4', 'men', 'instead', '4', 'women', 'LA', 'not', 'New', 'York', 'have', 'not', 'discovered', 'wonder', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'mean', 'never', 'even', 'knew', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'had', 'brother', 'show', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'Johnny', 'Drama', 'probably', 'one', 'funniest', 'smartest', 'most', 'complex', 'characters', 'written', 'television', 'date', 'absurd', 'self-centered', 'pathetic', 'self-conscious', 'puerile', 'weathered', 'smart', 'stupid', 'still', 'very', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'Dillon', 'take', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'character', 'fill', 'so', 'many', 'nuances', 'Drama', 'can', 'go', 'one', 'extreme', 'next', 'matter', 'seconds', 'often', 'still', 'totally', 'buy', 'could', 'watch', 'Dillon', 'act', 'hours', 'good', 'love', 'Jeremey', 'Piven', 'have', 'say', 'anyone', 'should', 'be', 'nominated', 'win', 'Emmy', 'should', 'be', 'Dillon.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'DVD', 'boxset', '4', '5', 'stars', 'show', '5', '5', 'DVD', '3', '5', 'lack', 'extras']",Entourage - The Complete First Two Seasons
