Guys are disappointed that there isn't enough football and/or sex, and women disappointed that Colin Firth isn't playing a god.  And that Gemell's Sarah is rather earnest and humorless.  But I thought this was a lovely, modest, good-natured film about the messy lives of `real-seeming people.  The former Mr. Darcy, and current King George VI makes a rather alarmingly good slobby, sweet-natured, thirty-something middle school teacher, who needs a haircut, coasts by on charm, and lives for Arsenal.  His effortless connection with students and parents irks the living crap out of his hard-diving next-door neighbor in the school, Sarah, who works her butt off, has all her ducks in a row, and brooks no nonsense.  By all the rules of romantic comedy, of course, these two are destined to get together.I must agree though that there seems to be no reason on earth for that US DVD cover.

559791,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00004YS58,Andy Orrock,"[22, 22]","I wrote an earlier review of Nick Hornby's 'Fever Pitch' as well.  It's worth writing a separate review of the movie because it's so different.  Not better, or worse.  Just different.  The book focuses on Hornby's lifelong obession with Arsenal, the English Premiership football (aka 'soccer') club.  In the movie, Hornby's written a script that focuses on one extended episode from the book.  It becomes more of a relationship movie.Here's evidence of the difference:  my wife tried to read the book, but could only stomach about 30 pages of it.  I endured it, liked it, but I'll admit that it can be a tough slog for someone that didn't grow up with English football.  The names of Arsenal players, coaches and opponents became a blur at times.In contrast, we both enjoyed the movie a great deal.  It's a cute little story (nothing more), and we both like all of Colin Firth's work.  He's a little more rumpled than usual here, but compelling nevertheless.Oh yeah, ignore the cover box.  There are no topless women.  No strategically placed soccer cleats.  It's yet another odd effort by American re-packagers thinking they have to disguise the true nature of a British movie (see also &quot;Brassed Off&quot; and, most egregiously, &quot;East is East&quot;).",4,Worth it despite the usual US marketing screwup,1017014400,"03 25, 2002",2002,1261,"['wrote', 'earlier', 'review', 'Nick', 'Hornby', 'Pitch', 'as', 'well', 'worth', 'writing', 'separate', 'review', 'movie', 'so', 'different', 'Not', 'better', 'worse', 'Just', 'different', 'book', 'Hornby', 'lifelong', 'obession', 'Arsenal', 'English', 'Premiership', 'football', 'aka', ""'soccer"", 'club', 'movie', 'Hornby', 'written', 'script', 'one', 'extended', 'episode', 'book', 'more', 'relationship', 'evidence', 'difference', 'wife', 'tried', 'read', 'book', 'could', 'only', 'stomach', '30', 'pages', 'endured', 'liked', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'can', 'be', 'tough', 'slog', 'someone', 'did', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'English', 'football', 'names', 'Arsenal', 'players', 'coaches', 'opponents', 'became', 'blur', 'times.In', 'contrast', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'great', 'deal', 'cute', 'little', 'story', 'nothing', 'more', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'work', 'little', 'more', 'rumpled', 'usual', 'here', 'compelling', 'nevertheless.Oh', 'yeah', 'ignore', 'cover', 'box', 'are', 'topless', 'women', 'strategically', 'placed', 'soccer', 'cleats', 'yet', 'odd', 'effort', 'American', 're-packagers', 'thinking', 'have', 'disguise', 'true', 'nature', 'British', 'movie', 'see', 'also', 'quot', 'Brassed', 'Off', 'quot', 'most', 'egregiously', 'quot', 'East', 'East', 'quot']",N/A

559793,A3I7EHVQ4AAKFV,B00004YS58,"Christina ""Lisa""","[3, 5]","This is the original Fever Pitch, with the screenplay based on the novel both written by Nick Hornsby, who really knows how to write about people.  It is a very likable film. Colin Firth plays a wonderful Joe Sixpack; who knew?! It is interesting to see other members in the cast, who have also played more august roles on BBC productions on PBS play regular folk.  This is an obsessive guy who questions why we aren't obsessive too - and his reasoning is hard to discount. However there is a point where I was so fed up with him and angry after his speech about caring for anything for 18 years that I was ready to shut the DVD player off.  Since when does an obsessive have the right to make a moral judgment?  For a comedy, it was teetering on the edge of becoming too dark.  Well, the big match is preparing to happen and I feel like I should be getting snacks and be worried about traffic.  Also, the actors interacting with the action on television was priceless.  The drama building up was a rush. Without wanting to spoil any endings, I almost died laughing with how a climactic moment is portrayed. The soundtrack is wonderful, capturing the time and mood very well.I have no idea if Hornsby will ever resent how some of us look forward to his hand the storytelling and in the music direction of films with his name in the credits. He is one of those writers who seems to offer clarity on living in the modern world and also include a refreshing list of musicians I never heard before in the process or a refreshing perspective of music I have been listening to for most of my life.It is disappointing that this movie was not marketed on this side of the pond.  A good movie like this can teach even Americans to understand soccer.  Although, being a neophyte baseball fan, I am curious how the American remake will translate with what sounds like an interesting cast.  Still, my fellow Americans, give this a chance.

Riley,"[1, 1]","Unless you like football (soccer in the US) and come from a football crazy country (everywhere except the US) you need to have a good imagination to fully appreciate this movie version of Nick Hornby's book.  Fever Pitch is the story of a boy growing through his parents divorce into a man set against his fanatical devotion to his football team (Arsenal)the one constant in his life.  Despite the team's failure to deliver they are always there, always welcome him, never turn their back on him and always keep him waiting for success (18 years).  He has a career as a highly popular english teacher which is going nowhere, his focus is on coaching the school football team, at one point he even turns down a promotion to avoid losing his coaching role.  Love enters the picture in the shape of a very commited and serious colleague who in addition to the normal battles of love has to deal with playing second love to Arsenal.  In time Arsenal deliver and release the hapless childman and love can flourish.  Despite the sports fan theme Hornby uncovers some meaty stuff in Fever Pitch as he does in all his work, although you have to look a little harder in this one than most.

I have yet to see the American version of this film so I cannot make comparisons.  I'm baffled by British football but that is not an impediment to your enjoying this film.  Football is just the subtext for this film about a thirty-something lit teacher(Colin Firth) whose lifelong obsession with the Arsenal club allows him to make a tenuous connection with humanity.  This fanaticism comes into question when he developes a relationship with a fellow teacher(Ruth Gemmell).  Sports obsession is fine when it is put in it's proper context but potentially fatal when trying to be intimate with another human being.  Firth does just fine in his portrayal of the football fanatic, not overdoing it but giving a well-rounded picture of a man who has difficulty letting go of his adolescent obsessions.

Either it's one of Hornby's lesser books or the screenplay completely messes it up.  The characters are all ridiculous.  Ruth Gemmel as Sarah is thoroughly obnoxious and completely imbecilic.  She's uptight ninety percent of the time, but invites Paul (Colin Firth) to sleep with her the first time she has him over, and this is only a week or so after she first meets him and hates him.  Meanwhile, poor Paul is obsessed with Arsenal--a bit too much, admittedly, but Sarah acts like he's committing murder every time he goes to a game.  There is no chemistry between the leads, I don't believe they'd last two weeks as a couple, let alone six months or whatever it's supposed to be.  The pacing's all over the place, the best friends are irritating (hers more than his).  How is she expecting to pay that cab driver when she's wearing a pocketless dress and has no purse?  Why doesn't she just leave him alone?  Really, it's a waste of time.  See Bridget Jones' Diary again, or Pride and Prejudice if you need your Colin Firth fix, or wait a year or so for all his post-Bridget success films to come out.  Avoid this like the plague.

On the other hand, it is hard to see in the first place what the woman finds so appealing about Firth's character, Paul.

Eventually the fact that he identifies himself so closely with his football club and its ups and downs leads to the demise of the relationship, but she comes to see that she likes his identity, which is strong, linked to football or not. She has also been carried away by a certain infectious passion about football because it is so much a part of his life.

I doubt very much that I'd even care to watch this film adaptation of Nick Hornby's book if I wasn't already a fan although having watched this dvd with a non-fan recently I can understand why she thought this was pretty boring.  Interestingly enough the screenplay was also written by Hornby himself and I think even he couldn't do much to save this film that would leave you in snores if you don't fit the right audience profile as described above.  Hornby even picked the songs for the soundtrack which is pretty decent but otherwise the acting is pretty wooden and uninspired.  I liked the way Hornby tried to explain why the protagonist behaves the way he does as an ""adult"" linking it to his emotional trauma at having an absent father being brought up by his mother and hence filling the gaping wound in his heart by loving Arsenal as deeply as he imagined he would have done a dad if he truly had one.  His constant horrible fear of and expectation of being let down at the very end by the team mirrors the insecurity he's acquired as a child; if he couldn't trust his own father not to betray him he is constantly paranoid about his beloved Arsenal doing the same thing to him.Happily, with the help of his love interest and Arsenal's finally winning the title after 18 years he eventually allows himself to trust others again and hence to move on to a less maniacical emotional attachment where happiness for him is not dependent upon the team's successes.  Great screenplay but unfortunately the rest of what makes a film great is missing here and so unless you are a fan of the team this will be hard to sit all the way through.

And I am not referring to the racy DVD cover of football cleats dangled before a topless blond, with the caption, &quot;There's more than one way to score.&quot; If you follow the devoted football fan genre, the story is as weak as the cover is misleading.Yes, these 'small' English films allow Americans to see parts of London left out of the tour guides and brochures. This 'slice of life' of a football fanatic -- not a hooligan -- captures the teacher's small flat, the local, the grass roots fans, the seasonal swings in the mood around football. The Arsenal stands. The working class neighborhoods. But that's about all.If you want to summarize the film, think of &quot;About a boy', Hornby's book and film, and add football, and you have the basic idea for Fever. Substitute Colin Firth for Hugh Grant, and you have the same man-as-boy (&quot;Peter Pan&quot;) problem, only  Fever's Firth is arrested in his development by his devotion to football and Boy's Grant is arrested in his development by the financial arrangements made by his dad. Both characters have a strained yet essentially positive relationship with their fathers, and both of these thirty-something men have to sort out both their commitments to women and the unsolicited fatherly role model they play for impressonable teenage boys.The love story is hard to explain unless you accept the young, hardened, beautiful spinster theory, a woman who once accepting a ride home from the disheveled protagonist, immediately offers to have him spend the night. Yes, there is some logic in the opposites attract approach but the rest of the film offers more reasons for them to split then they have to stay together, outside the obvious bond that entangles them more than it draws them together.Yes, Hornby's humor is spot on.

It was organized much like the sports page--match by match, sort of a statistical chronicle of Arsenal over several decades. The film, on the other hand, centers on the personal life of the football fanatic (closely based on Nick Hornby himself) and provides much more balance and intrigue.The match-up of the serious, somewhat humorless female English teacher and the passionate-about-football but about little else male English teach is enticing. She wants to learn to loosen up and connect with her students and their parents the way she perceives he does, and he wants to be with someone attractive with backbone and spark. As played by Ruth Gemmell and Colin Firth, you see why these opposites attract and you also see why they conflict.Despite the provocative cover, I don't see why this film is rated R.
