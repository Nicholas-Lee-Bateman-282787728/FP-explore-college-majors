Heyart,"[3, 5]","Ok so the final season of Roseanne may not be the highlight of the long running series, but it is the final season and it deserves it's time in the sun along with the rest. In 1996-1997 we find the Connors as lottery winners, David and Darlene a married couple with a baby on the way, and Dan and Roseanne on the outs. It is a long,strange trip they were on but it ends in a way no one could forsee. Some love the final moments of the final episode and others hate it, but it ties up some loose ends, and it's Roseanne's way of rectifying a lackluster season, and catch a glimpse at what her life could have been had she never made it big. If nothing else this season is a must see for the long list of guest stars in wacky, far out roles.

I regret it now because 90% of this season is unwatchable.  I doubt I'll ever watch them again after going through them once.  The show strayed too far from the whole blue collar/working class element that made it a likeable show in the first place.  Winning the lottery was a big mistake because it led to these very unrealistic and delusional and flat out boring episodes of running around with the rich crowd and dreaming of being Rambo, Evita, etc.  On the bonus material Roseanne said she wanted to go out with bang and she did - but it backfired.  Roseanne(the show) stopped being Roseanne around season 7 in my opinion and went downhill with Roseanne having another baby(Jerry).  Having Dan Conner missing for half the episodes and cheating on Roseanne didn't seem anything like the Dan Conner of the previous 8 seasons and it was disapointing to not see John Goodman in every episode because he was a very likeable character AND actor(he was missing in half the episodes - huge mistake).  Huge dud.  To quote another review: ""Avoid like the plague"" and I would like to add ""Run the other direction"" if you see it in the store.  If you see it at a yard sale, don't bother.

1096052,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000UR9QQM,calvinnme,"[75, 79]","Many people did not like the ninth season of Roseanne, but in its totality, I found it fascinating. The main problem was that it was clumsily written and directed, and that is mainly why I am giving it three stars. Let me warn you there are SPOILERS AHEAD.The season opens with Roseanne having retreated to Jackie's house after a tremendous fight with Dan over lifestyle changes he will have to make for the sake of his health.  He is in complete denial, and she lashes out in fear of losing him to a second heart attack. She spends the day parked on Jackie's couch, watching TV and fantasizing about the various sitcom couples that she watched as a child. At the conclusion of the episode, Roseanne and Dan reconcile, Roseanne returns home, and Jackie watches the announcement of the winning state lottery numbers. Much to her surprise, she and Roseanne have won the 108 million dollar Illinois state lottery. This is where the series begins to make a slow turn from the show you have become accustomed to into something that resembles ""Absolutely Fabulous, Midwest Style"".The next major plot development is the cutting of the final rope that has been tethering this show to its former incarnation - the presence of John Goodman as Dan. Thus, in ""Honor Thy Mother"", Dan decides that with his newly found wealth he should try to see if something more than just ""warehousing"" can be done for his institutionalized mentally ill mother, and he takes off to a clinic in California to see to this task.With Dan away from home and all the money in the world at her disposal, Roseanne takes the show on a series of fantasy episodes. First, the late Jim (""Ernest"") Varney stars as a prince who becomes enamored of Jackie after seeing her on TV and comes to town to woo her, then Jackie and Roseanne enter an expensive, exotic, and very oddball spa where they are subject to all kinds of torments that are supposed to invigorate body and soul, but just seem plain silly in many ways. The Halloween special makes clear what the audience has suspected all along - that Jackie and Roseanne have morphed into ""Absolutely Fabulous""' Patsy and Edina, with the real stars of that show guest starring.  Next, the Conners are invited to spend a weekend with the wealthy Wentworths on their Cape Cod estate. Apparently the Wentworths use pill-popping and overindulging in alcohol as a means of dealing with their personal problems rather than just ""letting it out"", and Roseanne is more than happy to teach the family how to release their anger. Quite frankly, the fine art of temper tantrums is one thing I've always felt the uber-rich had down pat.Next is an episode so bad that it is seldom shown in syndication, and has me asking ""What WAS Roseanne thinking?"" Of course I am talking about ""Roseambo"". Seriously, this episode is ""Ed Wood"" bad. The villains in this episode are an ethnically diverse bunch, and yet they all have the same fake accent. There are two good jokes in this episode. The first is when the subservient middle-eastern women mumble through a choker and scarf and the subtitles don't match the mumblings.  The second good joke was when Roseanne was using such weapons as a set of hot rollers, dispensing with the terrorists one by one, and spouting parodies of action-movie tag lines such as ""Avon calling!"" after kicking down a door.This ends the fantasy sequence part of the season, and the rest of the season is back in Lanford. The Thanksgiving episode is more oriented around family relationships, and thus there is an up-tick in quality. At Thanksgiving, Bev, Roseanne's mother, makes a startling revelation about her sexual orientation. It doesn't make much sense that Bev, divorced for several years, financially secure, and whose romantic trysts with men have been the subject of several shows in the interim, would come to such a self discovery in her 60's or have been afraid to admit this fact about herself until this point. I think it would have been better to concentrate on the other announcement of this episode - that Leon and Scott are planning to adopt - and focus on the hardships and road-blocks that abound when they set off on that road.Next, in ""Home for the Holidays"", Dan returns to be home with the family at Christmas. There are happy moments - the Conners finally burn their mortgage - but at the same time, Dan seems uneasy and somewhat distant around Roseanne. At the conclusion of the episode we find out why, when Jackie overhears Dan on the phone talking tenderly to ""another woman"" - the nurse who is taking care of his mother in California. The next three episodes deal with the fallout of Roseanne finding out about the affair, confronting Dan about it, and mourning what seems to be the end of her marriage when she locks herself in her room and goes on a junk food binge. Although I really enjoyed these episodes as something that any woman who has been dumped for another could relate to, I found Dan's actions to be completely out of character. Perhaps that is the point - maybe Dan stayed by Roseanne's side through very bad times because he didn't really have any broader horizons in life, and now that he knows that he has alternatives he is taking them, or at least flirting with them.After a very mundane two-parter in which Roseanne uses her wealth to help rescue the Wellman Plastics factory that she and her sister worked in during the first season, come two of the season's best episodes. First, in ""A Second Chance"", Dan returns to Roseanne in an attempt to start over. The couple's reunion is cut short when Jackie calls with news that Darlene has gone into early labor. ""The Miracle"" is one of my all-time favorite episodes of Roseanne. All medical intervention possible is used to stop Darlene from going into labor, but she does so anyway, and delivers a baby girl that even the medical experts Roseanne has retained say is too premature to survive. The episode shows us two things to which we are unaccustomed - David being strong and Darlene being overtly loving, vulnerable, and selfless. It's truly great and yet heartbreaking seeing the two being a normal loving couple comforting each other and grieving over the probable loss of their child.The next three episodes - ""Roseanne-Feld"", ""The Truth Be Told"", and ""Arsenic and Old Mom"" are light-hearted comic romps that are OK but ultimately forgettable. However, the two-part series finale is excellent. It starts out somewhat slow, the premise being that the Connors and their friends are gathering for a celebration as Darlene and David bring their baby home from the hospital. But in the final ten minutes, through Roseanne's monologue, we learn that what we think we are seeing and have been seeing for the last seven years is actually a novel written by Roseanne based loosely on the truth. All of the characters do exist, but not as they have been portrayed in the show/novel. We also find out that Roseanne has recently experienced a horrendous personal loss rather than a tremendous financial windfall. This loss has caused Roseanne to throw herself into finishing her novel in the basement office that her family first set up for her at the conclusion of season two, where she hatches the state lottery storyline as a conclusion to the book she has been working on for seven years. We then see her finish her novel, put it aside, go into the living room that has the same drab furnishings from the previous seasons, and sit down to watch TV - alone. It was all very touching.I guess since I have been hypercritical of more than a few of the individual episodes, some might wonder why I am giving this season a three star rating. I actually did not like this season during its initial run, but on repeated viewings it has grown on me. Standing all by itself it would truly be dreadful.  However, you have to remember that by the conclusion of the eighth season, just about every issue between the various Conner family members had already been tackled and the show had become stale, so that there were really only two options - end the show at that point, or take it in an entirely different direction, which is the choice that was made. Thus, taken in contrast with the previous eight seasons, and especially the very mundane eigth season, I really liked the ninth season for the chances it took.You also have to look at this season in the context of Roseanne's actual life. By the ninth season, the show had gradually been losing that genuine quality of a real working-class family for a couple of seasons at least in part because, by 1996, Roseanne herself had not been living a blue-collar lifestyle for over a decade. Thus it probably became increasingly difficult for her to inject something into her work that was becoming a distant memory for her. It was probably much easier for her to do something she knew - play a woman with a blue-collar background who comes into sudden wealth.  I'm subtracting two stars mainly because the production quality could have been much better even given the exact same storyline. There should have been more effort put into the delivery of lines, and some episodes came off as unrehearsed and hurriedly thrown together.  Plus, it really saddened me to see Laurie Metcalf's character of Jackie change from a delightful bundle of unpredictable neuroses into a sidekick with a Barney Fife-like quality. You have to ask yourself, though, do you actually believe that people would still be talking about this show if it had gone out with a whimper after its eighth season instead of taking the bizarre turn that it did in its ninth and final season? I seriously doubt it. Thus, I do recommend this DVD set to any Roseanne fan, especially if you are familiar with the previous eight seasons. Just prepare yourself for more than a few cringe-worthy moments of TV viewing.",3,Roseanne goes out with a bang,1188259200,"08 28, 2007",2007,9829,"['Many', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'ninth', 'season',

I love the way there is equality and the wife speaks her mind just as well as the husband.  I love how they are an average, loving, dysfunctional family dealing with being working class and making it through real life situations in a truly unique and funny way.I just got the pre-ordered release of Season 7 & 8 and was thrilled to see I can now also pre-order Season 9 for a good price.  Those sharks on other sites as well as this one trying to get hundreds of dollars was ridiculous and it's now over for them.The first 8 seasons hold up very well even 25 years after the show began.  The subject matter is relevant and amusing today just as it was then.  If anything, it is more advanced than most of the new tripe showing all of the females on sitcoms sexualized, stupid, etc.  Roseanne's character is savvy, loving, a realist, perfectly flawed, and a REAL woman through her vivid and assertive personality.  She is equal to her husband and he knows it and is evolved enough to accept it...most of the time.The 9th Season did suffer through some nonsense.  Some of the shows are really nearly unwatchable.  But at this very reasonable price for the new release, buying this last season is worth every penny.  As you watch this season, many of the shows are unrealistic and cross into totally silliness and a few are just not funny, amusing or even able to hold up to reality.  However, and this is a big However, The series' 2 part finale is worth the watch of the entire season.  This finale is always in the top 100 all time best finales.

Not because every episode was necessarily bad...there were actually some very good episodes throughout the year, but because the whole ""lottery"" plot was kind of unbelievable (even though poor people DO win the lottery sometimes), and because the show lurched back and forth between very believable episodes (the first 3 or 4) and a few towards the end (Darlene giving birth), and totally farcical ""fantasy"" episodes (almost the entire middle of the season, which were mostly without Dan's character), as well as having Roseanne's mother coming out of the closet at almost 70 years old (that seemed very forced and ridiculous at that point) and Dan's mother trying to kill him (????) that were all played like some 3rd rate moronic sitcom, which ""Roseanne"" never was. So alot of its credibility as a very realistic show was lost. In fact, it was already starting to lose some of its credibility in past seasons (though mostly still very well done) - like when they had Roseanne's father revealed to be physically abusive, which went against the way he was treated in the earlier seasons, as someone that Jackie & Roseanne got along with great. Anyhow, one of the biggest problems with the final season is how the last 10 minutes wrapped everything up, revealing that Dan was already dead, they never actually won the lottery (okay...good) but that Becky & Darlene were actually married to the opposite brothers. Does that mean that the last 7 years of the show were all just made up?? And that Jackie was actually revealed to be gay, instead of the mother. Does that mean Jackie never married Fred or had his baby? Was her character an entire lie throughout the entire run of the series?? It was just insulting to the audience. It makes you go back & watch every other season wondering just what exactly did or did not take place. That's just ridiculous, and forced.

I'm not a television watcher, but the Roseanne show I definitely had to tune in.  I loved all of the seasons except this one.  Season 9 seems to start off alright on the first disc.  I'd say the first 3-5 episodes, then it takes a huge turn and gets lame and boring.  You know you're no longer watching the infamous Roseanne television series that will go down in history as one of the top enjoyable series of all time. By the time you get to the last few episodes on the last disc, the season starts to redeem itself a bit, but by then it's almost too little too late.Someone told me that once a show goes to Disney world or some other location, the show has officially hit rock bottom.  It's truly disappointing because the Roseanne show could have really gone out with a bang.  Apparently, it was Roseanne herself's idea to go in this direction.  By this time she was one of the biggest television stars out there and no doubt had power and clout.  Unfortunately, if you head down a wrong direction and your ego is so great you won't listen to others telling you it's not the way to go, then you have this Season 9 mess.  I own every Roseanne season except nine.  I won't buy this unless they're offering it for a couple of dollars.  And even then it would be to just sit there to complete the collection.",3,Being generous with the 3 stars,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",2013,1424,"['love', 'Roseanne', 'love', 'series', 'was', 'only', 'television', 'show', 'watched', 'time', 'when', 'was', ""'m"", 'not', 'television', 'watcher', 'Roseanne', 'show', 'definitely', 'had', 'tune', 'loved', 'seasons', 'one', 'Season', '9', 'start', 'off', 'alright', 'first', 'disc', ""'d"", 'say', 'first', '3-5', 'episodes', 'then', 'huge', 'turn', 'lame', 'boring', 'know', ""'re"", 'longer', 'watching', 'infamous', 'Roseanne', 'television', 'series', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'one', 'top', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'time', 'time', 'get', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'last', 'disc', 'season', 'redeem', 'bit', 'then', 'almost', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late.Someone', 'told', 'once', 'show', 'Disney', 'world', 'other', 'location', 'show', 'officially', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'truly', 'disappointing', 'Roseanne', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'gone', 'out', 'bang', 'Apparently', 'was', 'Roseanne', 'idea', 'go', 'direction', 'time', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'television', 'doubt', 'had', 'power', 'clout', 'Unfortunately', 'head', 'down', 'wrong', 'direction', 'ego', 'so', 'great', 'wo', ""n't"", 'listen', 'others', 'telling', 'not', 'way', 'go', 'then', 'have', 'Season', '9', 'mess', 'own', 'Roseanne', 'season', 'nine', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', ""'re"", 'offering', 'couple', 'dollars', 'even', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'sit', 'there', 'complete', 'collection']",Roseanne: Season 9
1096064,A5GIYITYJPWN1,B000UR9QQM,"L P ""lilip""","[12, 16]","I found this season more than demoralizing. As some people mentioned, most everyone acts out of character and their actions are so absurd and far fetched - bordering at unbelievable. There were times i seriously thought this was another show. It is as if the characters had no self awareness as to who they are and their pasts (continuity) and as if their personalities were rewritten to be new people. For example, the Dan we met in all the previous 8 seasons would never have cheated on Roseanne. He was just not the type. If he _did_ cheat on her because he now all of a sudden had the riches to be able to afford such indiscretions, it still would be out of character for him because - again - the Dan we met is not someone who'd cheat on his wife. So no matter how you twist and turn it, this just doesnt make sense.And then seeing Darlene go from being a free spirited, ambitious and somewhat jaded artist -  who was the first Connor to go to college and out of Lanford -  suddenly act all homely, sweet, calm and tender and decide to lead the kind of life her mother essentially had (and which she loathed), also seems out of place. In the previous season she got a job for a pretty decent salary in a publishing house, and now we are to believe that she gave all that up to be a mommy? That is so out of character. By the ninth season she even moves in with her parents no questions asked and apparently forgets everything about her ambitions in order to become what....a good housewife? Darlene?Jackie's role is reduced to that of merely ornamental. She used to be so funny and quirky and involved from the beginning on and starting around season 8, her role was reduced to one walking around with a baby in her arm, running into a room screaming something and then leaving again. Throughout the series, Jackie's presence in Roseanne's life had a profound meaning; you knew these women were really each others' best friends and the extent to which Jackie's presence was essential for Roseanne and her family was also very well worked out. All that is lost starting season 8 and especially in this season and the two barely ever have any meaningful exchange anymore.I think frankly, a lot of it might have to do with Roseanne's character (or in fact Roseanne Barr herself) who has - since season 6 - increasingly turned into just an annoying and unfunny figure. She is mean, vile, and unpleasant to be around. While in the first 5 or 6 seasons, there was a charm to her character and its causticity, because she was genuine and real, in Seasons 7 and 8 and now 9, there is a bitter aftertaste in your mouth every time she is in a scene and says something. I mean she never has anything intelligent to say, she never listens to anyone and she talks sh$%t ALL THE TIME. She also treats everyone like crap and while before that was actually cute, it is very annoying and sickening now. I think it has to do with the fact that Roseanne Barr herself, while this season was being shot, was having the hyper kind of life with all the success going in over her head, and doing things like getting plastic surgery (which made her look like a freak if you ask me) and divorcing her second husband to marry her bodyguard. She was becoming arrogant due to the previous successes of the show and that is what ultimately lead to the demise of seasons 8 and 9 - as apparently she was also given more creative control and wrote some of the episodes - which in turn would explain their sheer insanity.It is interesting to observe the kind of evolution TV shows go through as they move along in years.1) At first they start off very down to earth and innocent and actually as pretty original. They are feel-good shows, cozy, fun, simple.3) Then, as the show takes off in both ratings and reviews as well as with respect to the fame of the actors, the writers become lazy or are replaced quickly (thus the old formula is lost as everyone thinks they need to hire new folks to write exotic and outrageous scripts). The dynamic of the show changes accordingly. Now all cast members are stars and important, and the show reflects that and in a way moves away from the simple beginnings. As the private lives of the stars change, so do their characters. There is often a spill-over effect into the show from behind the camera glamor. Roseanne Barr herself did undergo a huge transformation, going from a simple, blue collar unremarkable woman to a Hollywood star winning numerous awards and leading an exotic, fancy lifestyle. Such dramatic changes will not go unnoticed in the show.3) Finally, the show ends on some absurd or far-fetched note, often something dramatic and sappy; a 180 degree turn from how it started out. In this last segment, the characters are often unrecognizable and rarely resemble the people we saw in the first few seasons.In summary, this season was terrible. They completely messed up the show by turning 180 degrees and making it into some kind of a soapy, sappy drama or - as I like to call it - some kind of alive version of Roseanne Barr's insanity. The show started off fresh, down to earth, warm and kind but it just ended with Roseanne's obvious insanity and neurosis' from some kind of a midlife crisis she had and too much fame. Winning the lottery, Dan getting a heart attack, cheating on her, dying, Beverly a lesbian at 70 - and then what was up with all those superfluous plot lines involving Leon and boyfriend. Come on. They should have stopped after the 7th season. This ending was just a depressing downward spiral unworthy of the spirit of the show.",1,A depressing downward spiral unworthy of the spirit of the show,1273536000,"05 11, 2010",2010,5580,"['found',

Bees are black and yellow too.I was surprised this show was renewed for a 9th season, as Dan's heart attack not only ended the 8th season, but the show being about the Conner family.Season 9 starts with Jackie and Roseanne winning the lottery.  This allows for new subplots to be explored (rich vs working class, et al).The finale is also a shocker - it's not a dream, JR doesn't come back alive (neither does Dan), and it's essentially said that Roseanne's story (everything from when her family gave her the basement as a writer's study in season 2 onward) was the book she was writing; and the fates of the characters given unexpected shake-ups.  Roseanne gets real credit for having dared to experiment, though at this point the show wasn't about the Conner family anymore.  It couldn't.  Dan wasn't around half the time...And because he wasn't, other characters took his place.  More time was spent on Leon, Mark, David, Darlene, et al...The holiday episodes are also high marks for creativity, if not being unorthodox -- the Halloween episode features the cast of the BBC sitcom ""Absolutely Fabulous"".  This is not, nor can it be, a typical Roseanne Halloween.  And it does a good job at being wacky, but it's crude.  ""Satan, Darling"" is the name of that episode.""Pampered to a Pulp"" is another crude but terrific entry, as Roseanne and Jackie go to a spa and get a treatment they were not expecting...""Home is Where the Afghan Is"" is the Thanksgiving episode that features another shake-up or two.  It's different with Dan being gone, but it features some great character moments with Roseanne's mom... and a particularly welcoming ending that reminds us the show still thinks of its roots while moving forward...I also found ""Hoi Polloi Meets Hoiti Toiti"" amusing; Roseanne and her extended family go and meet this rich snobby family.  Some of the one-liners and gags are hilarious, especially the ones pertaining to dinner time and how often clothes get changed...""The Truth Be Told"" is a semi-parallel to Roseanne (the actress) and her rise to fame.  At this point it's clear that a lot of the season has a lit of tidbits revolving around Roseanne (the actress)'s personal life, but most comedy stems from real life at one point or another anyway.""Into That Good Night"" is the finale, of course.  Already mentioned, if nothing else get the DVD set for this one.DVD quality is on par.  6~7 episodes per disc is a nicety too.There's a lot of flak in this season, partly due to the cast being shaken up (actors leaving, reduced roles, altered motivations), but the finale explains all that away.True, this show is no longer about the Conners, and the heyday is long over with, but there IS something of value in this final season.Oddly enough, I'm glad I bought it.  And the only reason I did was because Roseanne has said some things over the last year that really perked me up - so buying the disc ensures she'll get some residuals.  The fact some of these episodes aren't utterly stupid is a bonus.
