Most of the footage has been seen before in past Doors DVD's but is in pristine quality.The film has a very good flow to it. It's a bio of the band and done for the most part in Chronological order. I wish they showed full songs in the film, but it's not the style that would go well if they did it that way.My only gripe (just 1) is how they talked about the way Jim died. The made it as if he just passed out and died but we all know he was doing heavy drugs and was in Paris and was a big time coke head and drunk. Him and Pam were doing drugs, she passed out and Jim snorted some Herione thinking it was Coke by mistake. He hemmorraged and died, while Pam was sleeping. She then was given his entire estate and was set for life but died of a Herione overdoes just 3 yaers later.",5,"Good Film, lacks full songs tho",1285459200,"09 26, 2010",2010,818,"['very', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'Doors', 'Most', 'footage', 'been', 'seen', 'past', 'Doors', 'DVD', 'pristine', 'quality.The', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'flow', 'bio', 'band', 'done', 'most', 'part', 'Chronological', 'order', 'wish', 'showed', 'full', 'songs', 'film', 'not', 'style', 'would', 'go', 'well', 'did', 'only', 'gripe', 'just', '1', 'how', 'talked', 'way', 'Jim', 'died', 'made', 'just', 'passed', 'out', 'died', 'know', 'was', 'doing', 'heavy', 'drugs', 'was', 'Paris', 'was', 'big', 'time', 'coke', 'head', 'drunk', 'Him', 'Pam', 'were', 'doing', 'drugs', 'passed', 'out', 'Jim', 'snorted', 'Herione', 'thinking', 'was', 'Coke', 'mistake', 'hemmorraged', 'died', 'Pam', 'was', 'sleeping', 'then', 'was', 'given', 'entire', 'estate', 'was', 'set', 'life', 'died', 'Herione', 'just', '3', 'yaers', 'later']",When You're Strange: A Film About The Doors

1345569,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B003H5WF3U,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[2, 4]","WHEN YOU'RE STRANGE BLU-RAY is a fantastic film that combines footage from concerts, interviews, and from a movie entitled ""HWY"" and ""Feast Of Friends"" in the credits, which starred Morrison driving a car out on some isolated highway. The footage from the ""HWY"" movie is in such pristine condition that at first I thought I was watching a re-enactment!The narration by Johnny Depp is sublime and describes the rise of the Doors and Morrison's ever erratic behavior, as he starts drinking and abusing drugs, and also showcases Jim's poetry.I'm new to the Doors, so I can't say whether or not a lot of the footage and what's been covered in this movie is accurate or even if it's been done to death, but it's an interesting documentary and I enjoyed it very much. The only thing missing is current interviews with the surviving members of the Doors or other people who were around them at that time, so this isn't like a ""Behind The Music"" or ""Unsung"" type of film.I knocked off one-star because of the paltry special features! The producers of the Blu-Ray disc are really making a mockery of what it's supposed to be. I thought the lure of BR, aside from image quality, was all the goodies that are included like interviews, bonus shorts, films etc. The only special feature you get is a trailer and a less than 9-minute interview with Jim Morrison's father and sister. They couldn't add the entire HWY movie as a special? Or some concert footage? Something???Also no ""scene-selection"" option.So I recommend buying this BR if you're a big Doors fan or like documentaries that are well put together or if, like me, you enjoy seeing stuff from the turbulent 60s (there's footage of Kent State, Vietnam, Draft Card Burning etc.).

Outside of the footage from HWY, I don't think there was anything new in this film. Same old clips mixed in with nude chicks and Viet Nam.

This wouldn't even rate three stars if not for that fantastic footage from HWY. Why wasn't that film added as a bonus? Perhaps they're saving it so they can squeeze yet more money from Doors fans.

1345572,A13C072YCYHT62,B003H5WF3U,B. Gordon,"[29, 41]","I'm the lone naysayer for this documentary (it appears so far). Let me first start off by stating that I've been a Doors fan for more than 30 years and I've seen more than 85% of the footage shown in this documentary. But having said that, the biggest disappointment with this so-called documentary is just how little new footage it actually contains given that the band supposedly ""opened the vaults"" to Dicillo. For anyone who has been a Doors fan and has seen much of the already commercially available Doors footage (released over the past 25 years) there is very little new in this film that would excite the viewer. If anything, the only thing worth getting excited about is the fact that Dicillo was able to get pristine quality footage and that alone may be the sole reason worth seeing this film.Otherwise, you are left with a terrible narrative construction filled with cliches about the band, Jim Morrison and of course, the sixties. Johnny Depp does his ably best to surround this film with a certain ""je ne sais quois"" mystique but it doesn't hold water at all. For one thing, Dicillo wrote this narrative and he sheds absolutely NO LIGHT WHATSOEVER on the Doors or Jim Morrison. Matter of fact, there is NOTHING new in this film that hasn't already been mentioned in previous interviews and previously made available commercial footage. The only thing that some people might have never seen before is the footage taken from Jim's movie, HWY. But all you get are snippets which don't amount to very much. One has to seriously question Dicillo's direction when he put this film together because there is so little if anything that's new in it one wonders exactly what exactly was his goal and what was he expecting to accomplish?  There are ZERO interviews with intimates of Jim Morrison such as Babe and Tony Funches, for example. These are people who are still alive and knew Jim fairly intimately. There are many other individuals who could have been interviewed. And what about Jim's poetry?  We get so little in this documentary given that Jim recorded HOURS of  his poetry in a professional studio. In the end, what makes the Doors and Jim Morrison worth considering all these years later?  This film doesn't answer the question at all and instead gives us what we've been given already before which is previously released footage of both the band and Jim Morrison while shedding no new light or insight about the band, the music, or Jim Morrison.  This was a serious misfire on the part of Dicillo and this film does not at all deserve the kudos these Amazon reviewers have been giving it. If you are a Doors neophyte and no next to NOTHING about the Doors or Jim Morrison then you might glean something of value from this film. But if you're a long time fan and collector of both Jim's poetry, the doors music and you already have seen most of what has already been commercially made available over the past 25 years, then you will find preciously little in this film of significance.  The Doors obviously have very little in their vaults and all you get are 5 to 10 second snippets of the Doors performing in concert at various venues with no soundboard recordings from any of the concerts shown. It's a huge let down for long-time Doors fans who were expecting much more in terms of previously unseen footage both of the band and Jim Morrison.I paid $12 to see this film at the Kabuki theater in San Francisco and the theater was 4/5th's empty. Everyone seemed bored who watched this film and after making it through 30 minutes of this film I found myself barely able to make it through the rest. It was unoriginal, with a badly written narrative. I don't recommend this film at all unless you've never seen any film footage of the Doors before. I'm very harsh in my review of this film because I was expecting something much different than what was delivered.

1345574,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B003H5WF3U,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[1, 1]","Thanks to some fascinating desert footage, Jim Morrison is alive and angry in the 2010 documentary ""When You're Strange: A Film about The Doors."" Made with the cooperation of Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger and John Densmore, surviving members of the 1960's rock band The Doors, it's an impressive work culling together old home movies, back-stage footage and the narration of Johnny Depp. The desert footage is a wonder, with computer-enhanced scenes from Morrison's experimental 1969 film ""HWY,"" showing him driving and strolling along a Mojave Desert highway. It's effectively used as a frame throughout the documentary.I'm not sure as to the depth of this work as the strategic decision to eliminate modern-day interviews erodes perspective on the band's stormy history and the tragedy of lead singer Morrison dying at the age of 27. It's close to the truth, but not close enough.One of the great rock bands in history, and certainly the rare American group that can stand alongside the British juggernaut of The Beatles, Led Zeppelin and The Rolling Stones, The Doors exploded in fame in 1967 with the release of their debut album (Doors) and the single ""Light My Fire."" As with most great bands, it was a combination of luck and the melding of unusually talented musicians working with a magical focus. I loved the detail provided on the backgrounds of members as we learn of the classical training of keyboardist Manzarek (Light My Fire) and guitarist Krieger and the jazz influences of drummer Densmore (Riders on the Storm: My Life with Jim Morrison and the Doors). Combined with Morrison, part sex symbol and poet, inspired by William Blake (The Complete Poetry & Prose of William Blake) and Arthur Rimbaud, not to mention the aura of Elvis Presley, the dark, Gothic, flower-child mysticism of the unusually intelligent quartet was like nothing American mainstream had seen before. Imagine The Byrds blended with The Sex Pistols.I was first exposed to The Doors when I read the 1980 Morrison biographyNo One Here Gets Out Alive, a feverish expose that molded the legend. Its bestselling success combined with Francis Ford Coppola's use of The Doors' song ""The End"" inApocalypse Now [HD], provided an incredible resurrection that continues to this day. Director Oliver Stone was a fan and directed the 1991 filmThe Doors, a blustery and laughable recount famously scorned by band members. Thus, this documentary was born, an attempt to tell the true story of the creative greatness of Morrison.Some interesting facts detailed was the era of The Doors was brief, a mere five years starting in 1967 and crashing to a halt when Morrison was found dead in a bath tub in 1971 during a pilgrimage to Paris. Within that span, they would record six excellent studio albums with a string of enduring hits including ""People Are Strange,"" ""Hello, I Love You,"" ""Touch Me,"" and ""Riders on the Storm."" I had also forgotten how Morrison's father, a conservative admiral in the U.S. Navy, had written his son after The Doors' debut success to say he was ""not a good singer and should cease and desist from such ridiculous folly."" The telling revelation is a clue as to Morrison's increasingly self-destructive behavior.The documentary covers the bases -- the band's beginning spark when Morrison and Manzarek were film school classmates at UCLA, their fateful meeting on Venice Beach, the recruitment of Krieger and Densmore and the now-legendary performances at the Sunset Boulevard club Whiskey A-Go-Go. Never-before-seen footage of the band in the recording studio also provides an interesting snapshot into their creative process.The band's most notorious event, the ill-fated 1969 Miami concert that burst into chaos -- and arguably the moment The Doors began their tailspin -- is detailed with photographs and a bootleg recording. This was the concert where a very drunk Morrison, after having viewed performances of The Living Theater, decided to test the audience in a similar vein. He pretended to expose himself on stage, the security quelled a near-riot, and after four songs the concert abruptly concluded. Days later, the Miami police put out a warrant for Morrison's arrest for lewd behavior and indecent exposure. Suddenly, The Doors' appearances were canceled across the country and lawyers were fighting to keep the singer out of jail.To this day people believe the myth Morrison exposed himself on stage. If ""When You're Strange"" has one achievement, it is exposing the exposure as false. But the fallout was profound, causing The Doors to reject an invitation to play Woodstock (Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace and Music Director's Cut) -- and who knew that festival would achieve such historic proportions? -- and struggle to find dates to perform. They would record one more album,L.A. Woman, which I believe is their best, and Morrison with girlfriend Pamela Courson would travel to Paris. Then, under the most mysterious circumstances, he was gone.""When You're Strange"" is not a great documentary, but it's good. It only scratches the surface of this extraordinary band and the iconic aura of Morrison. In many ways American mythic akin to James Dean, we wonder what could have been. Practically homeless, his girlfriend Pamela would die a few years later of a heroin overdose (Angels Dance and Angels Die: The Tragic Romance of Pamela and Jim Morrison). Surviving band members continued as a trio and recorded new albums with minor success. The music was over. The documentary ignores this fallout, and avoids the dirty secret of Morrison's alcoholism, depression and suicidal tendencies. In many ways it further perpetuates Stone's dark myth of The Lizard King, which was the opposite reason this documentary was produced in the first place.Thanks in no small part to that great footage of Jim on the loneliest of highways, the haunting mystery continues. ""When You're Strange"" gives us the ghost of Mr. Mojo Risin. It's a shame we have yet to define the man and his influence.",4,Exposing the Exposure...,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,5986,"['Thanks', 'fascinating', 'desert', 'footage', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'alive',

I thought it would be another low-rent,poorly made documentary aimed at one thing.... getting your money. I will never make that near mistake again. This is by far one of the most straight ahead films I've seen on the Doors. Number one, they used the real Doors music,not some ""fake"" music or copy studio band. The film brought out a lot of lesser-known facts about the Doors and the back up musicians they used on their albums.One fact was Jerry Scheff (Elvis's bass player)played on the LA Woman album. Also, the fact that Johnny Depp narrated the story and did a fine, uncompromisingly good job. Also, it was apparent throughout the entire film that no corporation (or any big company for that matter) was pulling the strings to create this beautiful,well done documentary,therefore it did not wreak of commercialism which was extremely refreshing. The Doors were true geniuses, all of them, and this film certainly is a credit to them. My advice,if you want to see the real Doors as they really were,get this DVD and know it's money well spent.",5,Absolutely Brilliant,1317772800,"10 5, 2011",2011,1138,"['tell', 'truth', 'was', 'extremely', 'unsure', 'buying', 'almost', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'low-rent', 'poorly', 'made', 'documentary', 'aimed', 'one', 'thing', 'getting', 'money', 'will', 'never', 'make', 'near', 'mistake', 'again', 'far', 'one', 'most', 'straight', 'ahead', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Doors', 'Number', 'one', 'used', 'real', 'Doors', 'music', 'not', 'fake', 'music', 'copy', 'studio', 'band', 'film', 'brought', 'out', 'lot', 'lesser-known', 'facts', 'Doors', 'back', 'up', 'musicians', 'used', 'albums.One', 'fact', 'was', 'Jerry', 'Scheff', 'Elvis', 'bass', 'player', 'played', 'LA', 'Woman', 'album', 'Also', 'fact', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'narrated', 'story', 'did', 'fine', 'uncompromisingly', 'good', 'job', 'Also', 'was', 'apparent', 'entire', 'film', 'corporation', 'big', 'company', 'matter', 'was', 'pulling', 'strings', 'create', 'beautiful', 'well', 'done', 'documentary', 'did', 'not', 'wreak', 'commercialism', 'was', 'extremely', 'refreshing', 'Doors', 'were', 'true', 'geniuses', 'film', 'certainly', 'credit', 'My', 'advice', 'want', 'see', 'real', 'Doors', 'really', 'were', 'get', 'DVD', 'know', 'money', 'well', 'spent']",When You're Strange: A Film About The Doors
1345576,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B003H5WF3U,D. Hartley,"[117, 132]","In the short 4  years that keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robbie Krieger, drummer John Densmore and lead vocalist Jim Morrison enjoyed an artistic collaboration, they produced six timelessly resonant studio albums and the classic Absolutely Live (which still holds up as one of the best live albums ever by a rock band). The Doors were also one of the first rock bands to successfully bridge deeply avant-garde sensibilities with popular commercial appeal. It was Blake and Rimbaud... that you could dance to.Surprisingly, it has taken until 2010, 45 years (!) after UCLA film students Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek first starting kicking around the idea of forming a band, for a proper full-length documentary feature about The Doors to appear, Tom DiCillo's When You're Strange. You'll notice I said, ""about The Doors"". I felt that Oliver Stone's 1991 biopic ultimately lost its way as a true portrait of the band, because it was too myopically fixated on the Jim Morrison legend; Morrison the Lizard King, the Dionysian rock god, the drunken poet, the shaman. Yes, he was all of that (perhaps more of a showman than a shaman), but he was only 25% of the equation that made The Doors...well, The Doors. That's what I like about DiCillo's film; he doesn't gloss over the contributions of the other three musicians.In fact, one of the things you learn in the film is that Morrison himself always insisted that all songwriting credits go to ""The Doors"" as an entity, regardless of which band member may have had the dominant hand in the composition of any particular song (when you consider that Morrison couldn't read a note, that's a pragmatic stance for him to take). The band's signature tune, the #1 hit ""Light My Fire"" was actually composed by Robbie Krieger-and was allegedly the first song he ever wrote (talk about beginner's luck). He's a great guitar player too (he was trained in flamenco, and had only been playing electric for 6 months at the band's inception). Manzarek and Densmore were no slouches either; they had a classical and jazz background, respectively. When you piece these snippets together along with Morrison's interests in poetry, literature, film and improvisational theatre (then sprinkle in a few tabs of acid) you finally begin to get a picture of why this band had such a unique vibe. They've been copied, but never equaled.The film looks to have been a labor of love by the director. Johnny Depp provides the narration, and DiCillo has assembled some great footage; it's all well-chosen, sensibly sequenced and beautifully edited. Although there are a fair amount of clips and stories that will qualify as old hat to Doors aficionados (the ""Light My Fire"" performance on the Sullivan Show, the infamous Miami concert ""riot"", etc.), there is a treasure trove of rare footage. One fascinating (but all too brief) clip shows the band in the studio constructing the song ""Wild Child"" during the sessions for ""The Soft Parade"". The real revelation is the interwoven excerpts from Morrison's experimental 1969 film ""HWY: An American Pastoral"". Although it is basically a bearded Morrison driving around the desert (wearing his trademark leather pants), it's mesmerizing, surreal footage. DiCillo must have had access to a pristine master print, because it looks like it was shot last week. It wasn't until the credits rolled that I realized this wasn't one of those dreaded recreations, utilizing a lookalike. As a matter of fact, Morrison has never appeared so ""alive"" on film.

1345579,A3B8V9P1I5O3UV,B003H5WF3U,Gary Pig Gold,"[4, 4]","The summer of 1970 was certainly a strange one in, for, and around what we may now quaintly call the pop/rock scene: Paul had just left his Beatles, for starters, the Stones and Dylan were missing-without-much-action, kids were throwing various Jacksons, Osmonds, and even Bobby Sherman way up the charts whilst the older kids were pretending to get back to the garden via a newly-released big-Hollywood Woodstock movie.Meanwhile, this Amazon Reviewer was busy buying up every single Creedence Clearwater record he could lay his young hands on, I'll have you all know.Then again there was the, well, strange case of John Densmore, Robby Krieger, Ray Manzarek and Jim Morrison who, after having closed out those Sixties with a ""flop"" album (""The Soft Parade"") and even floppier run-ins with the law (their singer having gotten busted acting naughty on stage in Miami, and again on a Phoenix-bound airliner) now found themselves in 1970 under immense pressure to resurrect their career and get back to where they once belonged. As in the basics, musically speaking that is.These various struggles, conflicts, lewd behavior indictments and then some are all fully explored - along with, thankfully, lots of great music too - in this fascinating documentary entitled ""When You're Strange: A Film About The Doors.""Now, unlike the band's own series of understandably self-serving concert films over the years or, on entirely the other hand, Oliver Stone's utterly cataclysmic 1991 biopic ""The Doors,"" Tom DiCillo's ""When You're Strange"" perhaps comes closest to finally presenting, as no less an authority as Ray Manzarek has long promised, ""the TRUE story of The Doors."" It does so by wisely keeping 21st Century interference to a bare minimum, concentrating instead on a wealth of live and studio footage from throughout the band's surprisingly brief career intriguingly intercut with - and this is the film's real coup to my eyes - never before seen segments from Jim Morrison's barely-released 1969 short subject ""HWY: An American Pastoral.""Without ever getting overtly ham-fisted a la the above-mentioned Mr. Stone, DiCillo (along with Johnny Depp's narration) weaves the HWY footage of Morrison speeding across the California desert to actually drive ""When You're Strange"" forward, onward and upward from the band's infant gigs on L.A.'s Sunset Strip through the recording of their landmark debut album in 1966 and subsequent stardom. It's interesting, not to mention important to realize and understand just how big a POP star Jim was at this time: He may have been playing it so cool by singing the dreaded ""higher"" word when The Doors performed ""Light My Fire"" on The Ed Sullivan Show, but at the same time this was a man only too happy to appear bare-chested and love-bead-adorned alongside Davy Jones and Mark Lindsay across the pages of ""16"" Magazine.""When You're Strange"" similarly pulls few punches in charting the band's just-as-speedy fall from those poppiest of heights, mainly but not fully on account of Jimbo's descent into the depths of alcoholic fear and self-loathing. It was indeed, and still remains, quite disheartening to watch The Doors' slinky frontman decline from the leather-clad Lizard King of every bad girl's Summer of Love dreams to the bearded, bloated ragamuffin who hauled sheep on stage in 1969, only to then berate his audience with cries of ""You love it, don't ya? Maybe you love gettin' your face stuck in the [expletive deleted]. You're all a bunch of [ditto] idiots!"" Oh, Morrison...Such performance Art with a capital ""F"" notwithstanding, footage from the band's 1968 European tour, and then a remarkable sequence from the ""Wild Child"" recording session itself, show The Doors were without a single doubt a FOUR-piece band, oh so much greater than the sum of its equal parts, with each man contributing his own special brilliance to the creation. There wasn't ever a single weak musical link to this band, its writing, arranging, and (usually) its performing skills, and ""When You're Strange"" never once lets the viewer get distracted from this critically important fact ...despite the carnival atmosphere which never seemed to cease swirling around the entire proceedings.Finally, we also see how, following that tricky Summer of 1970, the band fully rebounded with its final two albums, ""Morrison Hotel"" and ""L.A. Woman"" (again, ""When You're Strange"" presents fabulous footage from the latter's recording sessions ...apparently, the last existing footage of the band as a whole).But then, most inconveniently, Jim moved to Paris and rumor has it actually died there very early on the morning of July 3, 1971.Now he may indeed remain ""hot, sexy, and dead"" as Rolling Stone declared a decade later, kicking off the Doors Resurrection each surviving band member continues to propagate most efficiently to this day. Yet Tom DiCillo has bravely succeeded, where few have ever even attempted to before, in stripping away the excess, puncturing the mythology, and - What a concept! - letting The Doors' MUSIC do the talking.Strange indeed.",4,A Film About The Doors ...FINALLY,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,5074,"['summer', '1970', 'was', 'certainly', 'strange', 'one', 'what', 'may', 'now', 'quaintly', 'call',

1345580,A3IICSS30MRX9M,B003H5WF3U,Handsome Johnny,"[1, 4]","Most reviews are spot on.  Anyone who loves the Doors (or even casual fans) will recognize nearly every single clip and narrative, as the story adds nothing to the legacy of the group.  The shots are clearer than in the past, so that is a good thing.  The Hollywood Bowl performance and the 1969 Soft Parade sessions all appear crisp, as do the Smothers Brothers, Ed Sullivan, and the other clips from tours and promotional shots.  The mastering is stellar, and the sound is really pristine.  However, who cares if Johnny Depp is the narrator if no Doors members are interviewed, no associates of Jim's appear, and no one is consulted regarding the group and its music and/or Jim Morrison and his legend.  The ""extra features"" contain an interview with Jim's father and sister, which seems redundant because they are very, very short in duration and most bios state that Jim did not want to be represented by his true family.  Sure, it's one thing to watch his father give him props 40 years on, but it's another to actually realize that the two were not close, according to Jim.  If this is the ""true story"" of the Doors, then the Doors don't seem so relevant, because their story is so limited.  Truly, if this is the story, then we're limited to one major hit on their very first album (a success not duplicated), a few minor chart entries between 1967-1970, and a lot that recalls Lindsey Lohan's fall from grace-and I actually LIKE these guys.  If the fate of Jim Morrison doesn't happen to Lindsey Lohan soon, given Depp's chronicling of events, I'd be surprised, because, given this ""history"", Lohan and Morrison seem to be about as relevant as each other (Morrison's ""claim to fame"" was not writing the Doors' hits, which basically did not occur, but being a substance abuse pin-up just like Lohan, and that is what is depicted in this film.)  I am sure that the eventual Nirvana film will be more interesting, even though the band produced less music.",3,Thought it was a bit lacking in the information department,1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,1960,"['Most', 'reviews', 'are', 'spot', 'Anyone', 'who', 'Doors', 'even', 'casual', 'fans', 'will', 'recognize', 'nearly', 'single', 'clip', 'narrative', 'story', 'nothing', 'legacy', 'group', 'shots', 'are', 'clearer', 'past', 'good', 'thing', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl', 'performance', '1969', 'Soft', 'Parade', 'sessions', 'appear', 'crisp', 'do', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'other', 'clips', 'tours', 'promotional', 'shots', 'mastering', 'stellar', 'sound', 'really', 'pristine', 'However', 'who', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'narrator', 'Doors', 'members', 'are', 'interviewed', 'associates', 'Jim', 'appear', 'one', 'consulted', 'regarding', 'group', 'music', 'and/or', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'legend', 'extra', 'features', 'contain', 'interview', 'Jim', 'father', 'sister', 'redundant', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'short', 'duration', 'most', 'bios', 'state', 'Jim', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'represented', 'true', 'family', 'Sure', 'one', 'thing', 'watch', 'father', 'give', 'props', '40', 'years', 'actually', 'realize', 'two', 'were', 'not', 'close', 'according', 'Jim', 'true', 'story', 'Doors', 'then', 'Doors', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'relevant', 'story', 'so', 'limited', 'Truly', 'story', 'then', ""'re"", 'limited', 'one', 'major', 'hit', 'very', 'first', 'album', 'success', 'not', 'duplicated', 'few', 'minor', 'chart', 'entries', '1967-1970', 'lot', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'fall', 'grace-and', 'actually', 'guys', 'fate', 'Jim', 'Morrison', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'soon', 'given', 'Depp', 'chronicling', 'events', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'given', 'history', 'Lohan', 'Morrison', 'seem', 'be', 'about', 'as', 'relevant', 'other', 'Morrison', 'claim', 'fame', 'was', 'not', 'writing', 'Doors', 'hits', 'basically', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'being', 'substance', 'pin-up', 'just', 'Lohan', 'what', 'depicted', 'film', 'am', 'sure', 'eventual', 'Nirvana', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'even', 'band', 'produced', 'less', 'music']",When You're Strange: A Film About The Doors

Jim's alcohol and drug abuse is common knowledge but it seems to be the basic plot of this film.  The narrator mentions this repetitively until becoming very grim and tiresome.  When you're strange is an 86 minute dead horse beating.  The film should have focused more on the talent and charisma of Jim and the strange mystique that makes this band interesting enough to have two films made about them and still sell millions of records today.Others have mentioned that the film could have used more interviews from people who personally knew Jim and the band.  I couldn't agree more.  Before viewing this film I had the opportunity to see an interview with Jim's father Admiral George Morrison and his sister Anne Morrison on the American Masters website, for me these interviews alone were more interesting than this dismal film.  I am sure there are dozens of friends, associates, relatives and girlfriends still living who could have contributed an abundance of insight.  Someone needs to film interviews with these people while they are still alive to create a true documentary film.  One can only assume the three remaining band members are very controlling when it comes to the content of any authorized Doors film fearing outside contradictions may smudge the picture they have painted of the Doors and Jim.I can't help but notice that remaining band member's consistently come off as if they were three innocent and naive schoolboys stuck in a band with a raging, uncontrollable alcoholic who ruined everything.  If that is the case what is with the glassy eyes and indoor sunglasses commonly seen is the archive footage and photos of the other three?  Jim wasn't the only 60's rock star living this lifestyle.  There is much more to Jim Morrison than alcohol and drug abuse, if there wasn't the band would have faded and been forgotten long ago.  This film seems to have overlooked this.  It was Jim's raw talent that made the Doors legendary.  I wonder if the other three feel abused and cheated when they are cashing in on all those royalty checks compliments of Jim Morrison.",1,"Insert disk, press play, mute your TV and play your favorite Doors mix.

1345585,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B003H5WF3U,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[15, 21]","Man, there's been a lot said about this movie, then there's the word, and the word is, see ""When You're Strange.""Not a true documentary in the sense of a Ken Burns style intensive, exhaustive look into a subject. ""When You're Strange"" starts with scenes of Jim Morrison's ""HWY"" and uses the fictional device of Morrison hearing of his own death in Paris, then we see The Doors story pretty much from the beginning, and moves chronologically through The Doors career. This is The Doors through The Doors' own lens. All the footage derives from ""HWY"" and the concert film, ""Feast of Friends,"" that The Doors filmed in 1968. Also, included is footage from Ray Manzarek's student films, 60's period footage for context, and some previously unseen footage, except for maybe the hardcore collectors.For years Doors fans have been asking when and where, and if Jim Morrison's ""HWY"" and ""Feast of Friends"" will be released. Although, this isn't the stand alone film of either ""HWY"" or Feast, a lot of the footage has been used before. Ray Manzarek used ""Feast of Friends"" footage for MTV videos in the 80's, and the Soft Parade video in 91. ""HWY"" has been bootlegged for years and only the fortunate few have seen it (although You Tube expanded this base). This is the movie Doors fans have been asking for. Writer/Director Tom DiCillo (Johnny Suede, Delirious) intricately weaves together ""HWY"" and ""Feast of Friends"" and provides a narrative the footage lacked before, and perhaps if Jim Morrison had lived combining the two might have been a solution he might have chosen. DiCillo also makes choices that are a little riskier in presentation. As an example, he doesn't use the songs and the footage as obviously as before, usually, ""Riders On The Storm"" is presented with images of thunderclouds and storms, DiCillo chooses images of Vietnamese jungles flowering in explosion.""When You're Strange looks great! The footage has been restored and it looks as good as it did, if not better than when it was shot 40 years ago. Not only has the film been restored, so has the sound. Things have been pulled from the background you hear things that before were only muttered or obscured by crowd noises. The complete effect of the film is a much more immediate, impressionistic, and visceral view of The Doors than before.Narration for ""When You're Strange"" is provided by Johnny Depp and although it is a little basic and simplistic and at times intrusive, there isn't enough expository footage to move the narrative along without adding the intrusion of contemporary or even period interviews. Depp's narration is subtle and understated and his phrasing while not overly dramatic has the timing of the poetic.A lot of fans and The Doors have been critical of Oliver Stones 1991 movie ""The Doors"" (although, I think Stone was using the band as an archetype for the times, in a subconscious trilogy of the 60`s). The Doors have said they like this movie and I think the fans are going to like it too, and may consider it the definitive version/vision of the band. A good 3.5 stars movie.You're going to dig this movie.Bonus Features:The DVD (and the Blu-Ray) comes with:1) a booklet with quotes from Tom DiCillo, Johnny Depp, and Dick Wolf, with a collage of pictures of the Doors.2) A desk sized print of the movie poster.The bonus features on the DVD includes the movie trailer, and a ten minute interview with Jim Morrison's father and sister. The interview includes some interesting things about Jim, for instance, in high school when he learned a new word he wrote a whole story around it, Jim's father wanted him to go on to graduate school, Jim thought the audience deserved a spectacle at the shows, in the end Jim's father seems impressed with Jim's accomplishments.I may be swayed by the emotion of Jim's sister and father but this brief interview does give the viewer a sense of Jim Morrison as a person, when Jim's father concludes that Jim was someone you would want to know and he chokes up a bit, it is an emotional moment.Over the years people have formed opinions about Jim's father based on presumptions about Jim's attitude towards his family, what's been written in books, factual and not so factual, but to see Jim's father speak for himself about Jim will forever alter your opinion about Admiral Morrison.I think Doors fans may be a little disappointed in the dearth of the special features. I think there was the hope that ""HWY"" and ""Feast of Friends"" may have been included in their entirety because fans have long awaited official releases of those films and because they are the

The Doors crazy success and final trainwreck is like no other in rock history. Morrison, was a genius, crazy, drinking, drug taking man who in this documentary, with all great footage is far from either. This is a man who even as a child was like no other that reached the heights of pop-stature. Complicated and psychotic at times. Loving and evil incarnate in one mind. That is what this documentary's main focus is. The story never put to film without the ""Hollywood"" touch of Stone's film. Nothing against that as I loved that also. What was missing was the ""blood"" of Jim Morrison.  Here, you get it all with a side never shown of Jim. When he was ignored by the Doors & company for the greater good of the finished product in the studio. ""The 10 Ton Elephant"" as it's referred to. On stage, the was no control! This showed me that Morrison had deeper issues that had never been put to footage. For this, I thank what must have been a tireless blending of film and dialog. My outgoing opinion of Jim is different now. It wasn't all a show or a put-on. Morrison, due to his incredible genius and need to give and a double need to be loved, is what made us fans lose him.

Mr. Morrison had obviously not approved of Jim's chosen path, but had apparently come to terms with it and come to respect it.  These all too brief interviews are both touching and sad, showing that Jim Morrison was an enigma to his family, but they still love and miss him.

1345596,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B003H5WF3U,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[10, 13]","When I heard that Tom diCillo had a documentary on The Doors coming out, I was very excited.  His 1995 film,Living in Oblivionis a bitterly funny take on the frustrations of independent filmmaking.  More importantly, The Doors was my favorite band in High School - that I believed I'd discovered myself, a few decades after their heyday - and Jim Morrison became something of a personal hero.  I had posters of him on my wall, I had all of the albums, I readNo One Here Gets Out Aliveand a volume of his poetry, and I even grew my hair out to look like his before he'd grown a serious paunch and facial hair.  I've since outgrown this fad, having grown my own paunch and facial hair, and Ray Manzarek's organ just doesn't move me anymore, but who wouldn't want to go back and relive the exciting moments of teenaged discovery?Unfortunately, ""When You're Strange"" is not quite the intoxicating blast from the past I'd hoped it would be. The story the film tells is familiar - in fact there was almost nothing in the film that was not told with much more detail and passion in ""No One Here Gets Out Alive"" (at least as I recall it more than twenty years later).  There is some very intriguing footage, some of which I understand has been unpublished until now - and the subject matter held enough interest that I wasn't bored.  The problem is with the basic structure of the film, organized around the very bland and utterly conventional history-lesson narrative of a fairly unenthusiastic narrator.  I would love to see what Isaac Julien might have done with this material - hisDereknot only gave insight into the life of Derek Jarman, but had its own distinctive and memorable artistic voice.  This film is, for better or worse, Jim Morrison the stoner prophet, packaged for PBS.The film starts out strong, with footage I'd never seen before that seems to have been created as a kind of visual accompaniment to one of the storylines from the Doors' song ""Riders on the Storm"": somewhere in the desert there is a car accident, and a bearded Morrison emerges unscathed from a shattered vehicle, hitches a ride, and is later seen driving away in the same vehicle, no longer as passenger.  ""If you give this man a ride sweet memory will die ....""  Janis Joplin on the radio is interrupted then by a real radio broadcast that reports the famous singer Jim Morrison to have died in his bathtub under mysterious circumstances - and then we see an image of a candle going out and a montage of images of The Doors in reverse: what follows, clearly, will explore what happened and why this unique talent had died at such a young age.The problem is that what follows is not so much an exploration of a mystery as an explanation of a history.  A narrator tells the story of the life of young Jim Morrison, passing quickly through his childhood, as a voracious reader and Elvis Presley fan, to the point where he meets Ray Manzarek when they were both studying at the UCLA film school and they decided to form a band.  The filmmakers clearly had access to a wealth of footage and images, both of The Doors and of culture and events in the 60's and 70's.  What surprised me is that they didn't use these images to tell the story, but merely to illustrate the words, to the point that in many cases the words seemed redundant or simplistic.  He describes the music as unique and strange and unfamiliar, rather than showing it to be.  In a discussion of the infamous concert that led to Morrison's indictment for indecent exposure, the film shows footage of his walking through the crowd and chatting with the audience casually before going on stage, and the narrator explains (roughly): ""Before the concert, he walks through the crowd, showing no fear ... it is difficult to tell if he is giving something to the crowds or if he needs them, drawing emotional strength from their adulation.""About halfway through the film I began to wonder who was its intended audience - given the ability of the narrator to sap the life out of the mystery of Jim Morrison and the band precisely by explaining that and how their music and message were strange and unique, I wondered if the aim might be simply to clarify to those who never ""got it"", that The Doors were an important band, and that their meteoric rise and downfall was something of a microcosm of the social changes around them.  The film is not quite a puff piece, and I appreciated that it worked hard to show that Jim Morrison had flaws and that he owed a good deal of his success to the ability of the rest of the band to support him.  One thing I did learn from the film was that the characteristic meandering style of some of the band's longer songs (like ""LA Woman"" and ""The End"") really developed from the band's need to fill the empty spaces when Morrison was too drunk to keep going, and to build up musical momentum in a way that would excite him and get him back on track.In many ways this review may seem harsh - if the film had a different subject that could best be elaborated by a historical narration, then the approach of this film might be perfectly legitimate.  But to explain (repeatedly) that the strange really was strange, to point out that the revolutionary really was revolutionary, is to presume that the material has lost its life, and can no longer convey its own power.  The film ends on a joke, of sorts, with the narrator pointing out that (unlike many of their contemporary bands) none of The Doors' songs ever became a car commercial: unlike many of their contemporaries, I guess, The Doors never sold out...  But when they've been packaged like this, with their allure and their ups and downs explained so neatly, does it really matter whether they sold themselves out?",3,"Sadly, ""When You're Strange""

1345597,A3FA3BPKD4BZTE,B003H5WF3U,Ricardo Mio,"[2, 4]","Let's face it, Jim Morrison blew it.  He had it all: a talent for writing poetry, good looks, rich baritone voice, loads of charisma, wealth, fame, and it wasn't enough.  Morrison wanted more, more booze, more drugs, more kicks, and movie stardom.  Watching this documentary is a depressing experience, as it chronicles in painful detail the gradual self-destruction of a human being.Had Morrison had to struggle for success as, say, the Beatles had, he might have appreciated what he had and not fallen victim to his personal demons.  As it was, success came easily.  He didn't have to work for it.  With very little effort, it came to him.  Ray Manzarek was impressed with Morrison's poetry and invited him to join the band he was forming.  It wasn't merely another L.A. band of marginally-talented musicians who had learned to play in someone's garage.  It was a group of trained musicians who could read music.  Keyboardist Manzarek was classically taught, guitarist Robbie Krieger was schooled in flamenco guitar, and drummer John Densmore had training in jazz.  Under different circumstances, these guys would have been studio musicians.  It was the kind of band singers only dream of fronting, and Morrison unwittingly walked into and, as it turned out, took for granted.  As the documentary makes clear, he was ready to walk away from the Doors without a second thought, to pursue an acting career.The Doors, and especially Morrison, were blessed with an incredible ear for pop music.  As a result, they matured very quickly as a band and began turning out hit songs from the start, beginning with ""Light My Fire.""  Most of their songs began with Morrison's poetry, were set to music by the band, and emerged as pop songs of vivid imagery and sophistication, infinitely better than anyone was writing at the time, with the exception of Dylan, Lennon-McCartney, and Paul Simon.The Doors' songs still sound fresh after all these years, but you won't hear much of them watching this video.  What you will hear is Morrison screwing up big time on stage after stage, stoned, self-indulgent, gradually self-destructing.  For me, and anyone who's familiar with addictive behavior, it's painful to watch.

1345598,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,B003H5WF3U,Robert Blake,"[2, 6]","For years Doors organist Ray Manzarek has been threatening to release a response in film to the 1991 Oliver Stone biopic of the iconic 60s band, ""The Doors."" Nearly 20 years since that film premiered we finally get a Doors-sanctioned documentary on the band's history. But like most books and films officially endorsed by the subject, ""When You're Strange"" provides few real, fresh insights or information on the history of the band and its legendary frontman Jim Morrison. Tom Dicillo's film can work positively in two ways: As a fun introduction for anyone who's never known anything about The Doors or as an entertaining re-editing of footage hardcore Doors fans have already seen countless times.In a little under an hour and a half ""When You're Strange"" rushes through the Doors saga, chronicling the coming of age of Jim Morrison, the bright son of an admiral who enjoyed reading William Blake and Nietzsche while still barely in high school. Rock history buffs know the rest: Morrison goes to film school in Los Angeles, meets Manzarek and they form The Doors with guitarist Robby Krieger and drummer John Densmore. Morrison's poetic lyrics, combined with the edgy, jazzy music of the band create a rich, hypnotic body of work that quickly turns them into 60s icons. In a haze of booze and drugs Morrison burns himself out and dies in a Paris bathtub in 1971.Dicillo tells the Doors story in bare bones fashion. The narration by Johnny Depp is well-done but won't reveal anything new about the band itself, just the basics you could get from Wikipedia. In fact the narration is quite limited, sometimes reduced to one or two sentences in the style of ""Morrison went to UCLA film school, he made one film and got a D,"" cut to the next chapter where the band is already formed. Dicillo taps a bit into the Doors mythology, trading informative commentary for ""Morrison was a shaman leading his audience to worlds they would dare not enter alone."" This is fun when compiled with energetic concert footage, but we never even get one complete Doors song in the entire documentary. It almost feels as if Dicillo was not trying to reach any wide or new audience here, the film feels as if it is just catering to the long converted.One major disappointment here is that the film never bothers to really explore Jim Morrison's ideas, lyrics or overall philosophy. The film always feels as if it is keeping a distance, it is never brave enough to try and dive into Morrison's world or art. Again, it feels as if the target audience here should already know the finer details from reading countless Doors books and biographies. For example we never learn a thing in detail about Manzarek, Krieger or Densmore as musicians, their work in the studio etc. Few of the songs are ever properly dissected. The Doors made some powerful, timeless music, but anyone who wants to know about that should check out the ""Classic Albums"" DVD that explores the making of their debut. Morrison is described over and over as a poet but his poetry is never given a chance to even be explored or discussed. There's also a lot of 60s footage thrown in about Vietnam, the Civil Rights Movement etc., but it never goes with the story because the film never bothers to explore what Morrison or the other members thought about these events or their connection to the music.So what are the highlights? There's some new footage here and there from concerts where Morrison's stage power shines and the ferocity of his rock shaman image is apparent. For Doors fans a nice touch here is how Dicillo revolves the narrative around footage from an indie film made by Morrison titled ""HWY,"" usually available in rusty bootlegs, here the images are mastered into crisp, clear perfection. We see Morrison here as a hitchhiker on a dark journey through a desert wasteland. The film is entertaining, you just wish you got more out of it. As others have mentioned, most of the footage here is already available on previous Doors releases, particularly ""The Doors Collection."" What Dicillo has done here is taken it and for the first edited it together into some sort of cinematic narrative. As a quick introduction to who the band was it works, as a serious documentary study it never comes close.",3,Fun To Watch But Lacks Any Real Insight.,1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,4253,"['years', 'Doors', 'organist', 'Ray', 'Manzarek', 'been', 'threatening', 'release', 'response', 'film', '1991', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'biopic', 'iconic', '60s', 'band', 'Doors', 'Nearly', '20', 'years', 'film', 'premiered', 'finally', 'get', 'Doors-sanctioned', 'documentary', 'band', 'history', 'most', 'books', 'films', 'officially', 'endorsed', 'subject', 'When', ""'re"", 'Strange', 'few', 'real', 'fresh', 'insights', 'information', 'history', 'band', 'legendary', 'frontman', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Tom', 'Dicillo', 'film', 'can', 'work', 'positively', 'two', 'ways', 'fun', 'introduction', 'anyone', 'who', 'never', 'known', 'anything', 'Doors', 'entertaining', 're-editing', 'footage', 'hardcore', 'Doors', 'fans', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'countless', 'little', 'hour', 'half', 'When', ""'re"", 'Strange', 'rushes', 'Doors', 'saga', 'chronicling', 'coming', 'age', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'bright', 'son', 'admiral', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'reading', 'William', 'Blake', 'Nietzsche', 'still', 'barely', 'high', 'school', 'Rock', 'history', 'buffs', 'know', 'rest', 'Morrison', 'film', 'school', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Manzarek', 'form', 'Doors', 'guitarist', 'Robby', 'Krieger', 'drummer', 'John', 'Densmore', 'Morrison', 'poetic', 'lyrics', 'combined', 'edgy', 'jazzy', 'music', 'band', 'create', 'rich', 'hypnotic', 'body', 'work', 'quickly', '60s', 'icons', 'haze', 'booze', 'drugs', 'Morrison', 'dies', 'Paris', 'bathtub', '1971.Dicillo', 'tells', 'Doors', 'story', 'bare', 'bones', 'fashion', 'narration', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'well-done', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'anything', 'new', 'band', 'just', 'basics', 'could', 'get', 'Wikipedia', 'fact', 'narration', 'quite', 'limited', 'sometimes', 'reduced', 'one', 'two', 'sentences', 'style', 'Morrison', 'went', 'UCLA', 'film', 'school', 'made', 'one', 'film', 'got', 'D', 'cut', 'next', 'chapter', 'where', 'band', 'already', 'formed', 'Dicillo', 'bit', 'Doors', 'mythology', 'trading', 'informative', 'commentary', 'Morrison', 'was', 'shaman', 'leading', 'audience', 'worlds', 'would', 'dare', 'not', 'enter', 'alone', 'fun', 'when', 'compiled', 'energetic', 'concert', 'footage', 'never', 'even', 'get', 'one', 'complete', 'Doors', 'song', 'entire', 'documentary', 'almost', 'Dicillo', 'was', 'not', 'trying', 'reach', 'wide', 'new', 'audience', 'here', 'film', 'feels', 'just', 'catering', 'long', 'converted.One', 'major', 'disappointment', 'here', 'film', 'never', 'bothers', 'really', 'explore', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'ideas', 'lyrics', 'overall', 'philosophy', 'film', 'always', 'feels', 'keeping', 'distance', 'never', 'brave', 'enough', 'try', 'dive', 'Morrison', 'world', 'art', 'Again', 'target', 'audience', 'here', 'should', 'already', 'know', 'finer', 'details', 'reading', 'countless', 'Doors', 'books', 'biographies', 'example', 'never', 'learn', 'thing', 'detail', 'Manzarek', 'Krieger', 'Densmore', 'musicians', 'work', 'studio', 'etc', 'Few', 'songs', 'are', 'ever', 'properly', 'dissected', 'Doors', 'made', 'powerful', 'timeless', 'music', 'anyone', 'who', 'know', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'Classic', 'Albums', 'DVD', 'making', 'debut', 'Morrison', 'described', 'over', 'poet', 'poetry', 'never', 'given', 'chance', 'even', 'be', 'explored', 'discussed', 'also', 'lot', '60s', 'footage', 'thrown', 'about', 'Vietnam', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'etc.', 'never', 'story', 'film', 'never', 'bothers', 'explore', 'what', 'Morrison', 'other', 'members', 'thought', 'events', 'connection', 'music.So', 'are', 'highlights', 'new', 'footage', 'here', 'there', 'concerts', 'where', 'Morrison', 'stage', 'power', 'shines', 'ferocity', 'rock', 'shaman', 'image', 'apparent', 'Doors', 'fans', 'nice', 'touch', 'here', 'how', 'Dicillo', 'narrative', 'around', 'footage', 'indie', 'film', 'made', 'Morrison', 'titled', 'HWY', 'usually', 'available', 'rusty', 'bootlegs', 'here', 'images', 'are', 'mastered', 'crisp', 'clear', 'perfection', 'see', 'Morrison', 'here', 'hitchhiker', 'dark', 'journey', 'desert', 'wasteland', 'film', 'entertaining', 'just', 'wish', 'got', 'more', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'most', 'footage', 'here', 'already', 'available', 'previous', 'Doors', 'releases', 'particularly', 'Doors', 'Collection', 'What', 'Dicillo', 'done', 'here', 'taken', 'first', 'edited', 'together', 'sort', 'cinematic', 'narrative', 'quick', 'introduction', 'who', 'band', 'was', 'serious', 'documentary', 'study', 'never', 'close']",When You're Strange: A Film About The Doors

1345602,A21XBPZCLM2JJU,B003H5WF3U,Steve Feldman,"[31, 33]","John, Jim, Ray, and Robbie - probably the closest an American band ever came to The Beatles. Obviously comparing any band to The Beatles will most likely result in some sort of unjust outcry from the masses, but the comparison is there: 4 guys that the stars aligned to get together for a short period of time to create original music that spoke to a generation and is still going strong after 40 years.For me, I was born in 1964 so by the time I discovered The Doors, Jim had been dead 7 years. I was rummaging through a stack of old out-of-rotation LPs that a local radio DJ gave to my older sister. In the mix was The Soft Parade.  Having heard of The Doors, I gave it a listen. I remember thinking to myself, is this really The Doors' music, but the names on the back of the album confirmed it. Anyway, I liked what I heard and wanted to hear more. At that time, my music collection was mainly British bands like The Who, The Kinks, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd.  The Doors fit right in very nicely.As to When You're Strange (I have the Blu-Ray version) I found it to be entertaining. I have seen some of the footage before, but not this clean or sounding as good. As to the story, well, most everyone probably knows it, so this documentary doesn't veer to far away from what most fans already know. However, it is edited very nicely and covers as much as an 85 minute documentary can reasonably cover. To truly tell the full story with in-depth album by album coverage would require a multi-disc anthology set.I recommend When You're Strange to both the casual and avid fan of The Doors. I was very impressed with the clips from Jim's Highway movie as well as clips from his UCLA days and from when he was 16. The film is very fair and represents all band members. Certainly Morrison is the most notorious member and therefore, gets more focus. However, as time has proven, despite the vast musical talents of Ray, Robbie, and John, they really weren't anything without Jim as their catalyst.What The Doors did in 54 months is incredible and this film reminds us of those accomplishments. It also clearly shows that Morrison knew, well before the other 3 realized it, when the music was over.",4,When The Music's Over,1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,2197,"['John', 'Jim', 'Ray', 'Robbie', 'probably', 'closest', 'American', 'band', 'ever', 'came', 'Beatles', 'Obviously', 'comparing', 'band', 'Beatles', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'result', 'sort', 'unjust', 'outcry', 'masses', 'comparison', 'there', '4', 'guys', 'stars', 'aligned', 'get', 'together', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'create', 'original', 'music', 'spoke', 'generation', 'still', 'going', 'strong', '40', 'years.For', 'was', 'born', '1964', 'so', 'time', 'discovered', 'Doors', 'Jim', 'had', 'been', 'dead', '7', 'years', 'was', 'rummaging', 'stack', 'old', 'out-of-rotation', 'LPs', 'local', 'radio', 'DJ', 'gave', 'older', 'sister', 'mix', 'was', 'Soft', 'Parade', 'Having', 'heard', 'Doors', 'gave', 'listen', 'remember', 'thinking', 'myself', 'really', 'Doors', 'music', 'names', 'back', 'album', 'confirmed', 'Anyway', 'liked', 'what', 'heard', 'wanted', 'hear', 'more', 'time', 'music', 'collection', 'was', 'mainly', 'British', 'bands', 'Who', 'Kinks', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'Doors', 'fit', 'right', 'very', 'nicely.As', 'When', ""'re"", 'Strange', 'have', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'found', 'be', 'entertaining', 'have', 'seen', 'footage', 'not', 'clean', 'sounding', 'as', 'good', 'story', 'well', 'most', 'everyone', 'probably', 'so', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'veer', 'far', 'away', 'what', 'most', 'fans', 'already', 'know', 'However', 'edited', 'very', 'nicely', 'as', 'much', '85', 'minute', 'documentary', 'can', 'reasonably', 'cover', 'truly', 'tell', 'full', 'story', 'in-depth', 'album', 'album', 'coverage', 'would', 'require', 'multi-disc', 'anthology', 'set.I', 'recommend', 'When', ""'re"", 'Strange', 'casual', 'avid', 'fan', 'Doors', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'clips', 'Jim', 'Highway', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'clips', 'UCLA', 'days', 'when', 'was', '16', 'film', 'very', 'fair', 'band', 'members', 'Certainly', 'Morrison', 'most', 'notorious', 'member', 'therefore', 'more', 'focus', 'However', 'time', 'proven', 'vast', 'musical', 'talents', 'Ray', 'Robbie', 'John', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'anything', 'Jim', 'Doors', 'did', '54', 'months', 'incredible', 'film', 'accomplishments', 'also', 'clearly', 'Morrison', 'knew', 'well', 'other', '3', 'realized', 'when', 'music', 'was', 'over']",When You're Strange: A Film About The Doors
1345603,A19YOYY7FLQMA6,B003H5WF3U,"Tante Maren ""Maren""","[15, 21]","As a long time Doors fan since I first heard Light My Fire in 1967, I am always thrilled when I can find anything new on Jim Morrison and The Doors. I saw this new release of When You're Strange and found it to be a wonderful collage of Jim Morrison clips, HWY clips, Feast Of Friends clips, meshed with The Doors clips and performances, and mixed in are many news clips from the sixties and great photos. The feeling of the sixties comes across to show how The Doors did or didn't fit in with the times.I have the film HWY- An American Pastoral, Jim Morrison's 51 minute creation, and there are some pieces of the film shown here and there throughout this 86 minute film. I wish someone would make a pristine copy of HWY and put it on dvd, as this Jim Morrison film is fascinating, and seeing the brief pieces cleaned up so perfect in When You're Strange, makes me want to replace my badly faded Darkroom Entertainment  copy. The pieces taken from HWY are great, but too short. Jim made this film with Frank Lisciandro, Paul Ferrara and Babe Hill in the spring of 1969. You never know that the bits you see of Jim in his HWY film in When You're Strange, are about a man (Jim) who begins the film by swimming in the mountains, ends up hitch-hiking through the desert, kills the man who gives him a ride, taking the man's navy blue Shelby Cobra Mustang (1967 or 68 GT500 car, which I'm sure is Jim's) and driving to LA. The pieces of HWY used are mainly the shots of Jim that the director Tom DiCillo liked. It is very collage like- pasting pieces here and there for pure visual effect.There are some pictures of Jim that I have never seen before and a film of him as a teenager getting mail from his mail box that I really enjoyed seeing. There are also some great pictures of Ray, Robbie and John that I have never seen before, that were great to see. As a long time Doors fan, I really enjoyed this film, but it really is more like a collage (collage meaning glue in French) of bits and pieces of sixties, Morrison and The Doors footage. Johnny Depp does a great job narrating this collage film, which is a purely visual tribute to Jim Morrison and The Doors.If you are a Doors fan like me, every time a new dvd comes out on the Doors, it always leaves me wanting more, and because this one shows glimpses of a pristine HWY, I hope whoever gave these film pieces to Tom DiCillo, will give it to someone who will make this fascinating HWY film into a cleaned up dvd. Some never before released archival film and photos on The Doors is really great, but having a complete film with a little more substance, like HWY (1969), which is Jim Morrison's creation, or FEAST OF FRIENDS (1970) is much better!The 2 BONUS FEATURES included are:THE THEATRICAL TRAILER.INTERVIEWS with Jim's Father Admiral George Stephen Morrison (1919-2008) and Jim's Sister Anne Robin Morrison-Chewning (1947-present).The interviews are so very touching to hear what Jim Morrison's family have to say about their Son/Brother. It was so nice to hear about Jim wanting a complete set of Nietzsche Books for graduation, when most boys wanted a car and how as a little boy Jim loved going to his grandmother's house, because she had a library. I wish the interviews had been longer and had more of Jim's family involved, but sadly, Jim's Mother Clara Clarke Morrison passed away in 2005 at the same age of 89 that Jim's father died. It would have been nice to hear from Jim's younger brother Andrew Lee too. These interviews are priceless, especially now that Jim's Father, Admiral Morrison passed away in 2008.One thing I never knew about, was that Jim's Father placed a flat stone on Jim's grave in the 1990's. We had always heard of Jim's original 1971 grave marker being stolen in 1973, and that the 1981 bust of Jim (made for his 10th anniversary of his death by sculptor Mikulin) was always defaced and then stolen in 1988, always leaving no marker. It was so touching to hear Jim's Father speaking of this marker he had made for Jim in the 1990's. Admiral Morrison asked his Greek teacher what he should write on his famous son's marker. The Greek teacher said to write KATA TON ALMONA EAYTOY- in English, ACCORDING TO HIS OWN DAIMON (True to his own spirit). There is also another bust of Jim Morrison in bronze made by Mikulin, waiting for a license to be once again placed on Jim's grave.These interviews, were for me, the icing on the cake of When You're Strange. After listening to his family speak in this rare interview, you can see how Jim Morrison was born to be a poet, singer and film maker.
