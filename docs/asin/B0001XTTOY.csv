816853,A37SFXAWN1CXO0,B0001XTTOY,"Doug Danzeisen ""frankfan42""","[1, 1]","The truly unfortunately timing of this movies introduction in theaters was that it coincided with ET. Anybody who remembers ET will remember the hype that surrounded the movie, most of it well deserved. One casualty was this movie, which somewhat languished on the side lines as a result of opening alongside a more sensational movie. If you get a chance to watch this I recommend it. A few of the computer scenes are dated, but the story holds up very well.  A big city cop trying to get off alcohol and break his violent tendencies leaves the big city with his teen daughter to visit a good friend who owns a newspaper in a small town. He finds that cattle are being taken and mutilated and the tangled web of deception increasingly points to a clandestine gov't run germ warfare program. This program is run by those who consider themselves super patriots and Robert Urich keeps outsmarting them, ultimately threatening to expose them. The movie is fairly well done and subtle in its implications, but seems much more true to life as a result of this, IMHO.In all, I was thrilled to be able to replace my old Betamax copy with a DVD. The transfer is clean and clear and although not high definition does not look grainy or &#34;Old&#34; IMHO.  Sound is clear as well. The only downside is that there are no real extras to speak of, not that any are needed. But some behind the scenes these days is somewhat expected.Be warned that this disc is a made on demand product and will often not play in your laptop or desktop machine due to copy guards, but it is well worth the effort to sit down with a bowl of popcorn to a flick you will come back to watch again.",4,"Well done movie which had misfortune to open the same time as the movie ET, and got lost in the shuffle",1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,1662,"['truly', 'unfortunately', 'timing', 'movies', 'introduction', 'theaters', 'was', 'coincided', 'ET', 'Anybody', 'who', 'ET', 'will', 'remember', 'hype', 'surrounded', 'movie', 'most', 'well', 'deserved', 'One', 'casualty', 'was', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'languished', 'side', 'lines', 'result', 'opening', 'more', 'sensational', 'movie', 'get', 'chance', 'watch', 'recommend', 'few', 'computer', 'scenes', 'are', 'dated', 'story', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'big', 'city', 'cop', 'trying', 'get', 'off', 'alcohol', 'break', 'violent', 'tendencies', 'big', 'city', 'teen', 'daughter', 'visit', 'good', 'friend', 'who', 'newspaper', 'small', 'town', 'cattle', 'are', 'being', 'taken', 'mutilated', 'tangled', 'web', 'deception', 'increasingly', 'clandestine', ""gov't"", 'run', 'germ', 'warfare', 'program', 'program', 'run', 'who', 'consider', 'super', 'patriots', 'Robert', 'Urich', 'outsmarting', 'ultimately', 'threatening', 'expose', 'movie', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'subtle', 'implications', 'much', 'more', 'true', 'life', 'result', 'IMHO.In', 'was', 'thrilled', 'be', 'able', 'replace', 'old', 'Betamax', 'copy', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'clean', 'clear', 'not', 'high', 'definition', 'not', 'look', 'grainy', '34', 'Old', '34', 'IMHO', 'Sound', 'clear', 'well', 'only', 'downside', 'are', 'real', 'extras', 'speak', 'not', 'are', 'needed', 'scenes', 'days', 'somewhat', 'expected.Be', 'warned', 'disc', 'made', 'demand', 'product', 'will', 'often', 'not', 'play', 'laptop', 'desktop', 'machine', 'due', 'copy', 'guards', 'well', 'effort', 'sit', 'down', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'watch', 'again']",Endangered Species

How sad that good thrillers such as this one are getting so hard to find, like virgins in the soiled seas. I love Robert Urich's performance, and Jo Beth Williams (fresh off the brilliant &#34;Poltergeist&#34;) turns in a competent performance too--why didn't she continue on in the horror/sf/mystery film vein that she occupied during the early 80s? The script is taut, like a sailor's rope, the suspense is fine, and the pacing is deliberate.

Set in Colorado, the overall plot revolves around the true story of mysterious cattle mutilations in the American West. Are they performed by devil worshipers, space aliens, Soviet Spetznaz? Whatever you think, it's a depiction of a skillful, powerful, high tech entity that threatens to destroy the townspeople along with its ranching livelihood. Director Alan Rudolph does a superb job that is rivaled by the likes of John Carpenter and Michael Mann. Though known better for ""Vega$"" and ""SWAT"", Robert Urich proves his ability outside of TV. The version I have is a grainy copy recorded off of an RCA Selektavision Video Disc in 1983 (anyone out there rember those things?). It would be great if MGM would digitally restore this to DVD (as it has done with other great movies that I thought were too dated and obscure to restore). Any Art Bell fans in the house?
