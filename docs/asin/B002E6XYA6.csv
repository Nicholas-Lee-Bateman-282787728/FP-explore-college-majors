While the kids around her wandered through their lives without purpose, Amy knows what she wants to do. Unfortunately cancer intervenes and the peppy little encourager of all others finds herself in the position of needing some encouragement. This had a nice subtheme about interacting with kids who are loners. The acting was decent, allowing us to get emotionally involved in the threat to Amy's life. Definitely worth watching.",4,A tear jerker,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,521,"['was', 'bit', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'Amy', 'was', 'such', 'sweetheart', 'all-American', 'girl', 'kids', 'wandered', 'lives', 'purpose', 'Amy', 'what', 'do', 'Unfortunately', 'cancer', 'intervenes', 'peppy', 'little', 'encourager', 'others', 'position', 'needing', 'encouragement', 'had', 'nice', 'subtheme', 'interacting', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'loners', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', 'allowing', 'get', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'threat', 'Amy', 'life', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'watching']",A Greater Yes: The Story of Amy Newhouse
1264906,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B002E6XYA6,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[2, 2]","Faith Based Filming has come a long way toward taking their place alongside typical Hollywood flicks. It is shown to be a lower budget production from viewing the bonus behind the scenes material, where cast double as filming assistants but the job gets done, and done well. In this case it tells a TRUE story, perhaps somewhat altered to get years down to minutes, but the drama is certainly encapsulated. It is the story of Amy Newhouse, her battle with cancer, the ups and downs, and the faith and hope that she was able to not only keep herself, but pass along to others during the ordeal.What a perfect choice it was to cast Anne Underwood as Amy. She is joy personified. Her bubbly personality is contagious right off the screen. She is only the first of truly believable characters in this film. Another that must be mentioned is Paul Willis playing a teen with punk hair. I'm a retired teacher, and believe me when I say these two were honestly teen-realistic. I've taught hundreds like them.Bradley Dorsey as Tyler is the love angle in Amy's life. He looks the part (so young) of a lovesick teen boy until you see Behind the Scenes and see him as director (also writer, producer, editor, and who knows what else. There is a wait, but in Dec 2012, his new film is to be released which he does many roles again including lead, joined by Della Reese and Michael Gross. There's a step up.While this is definitely faith based, it is not Christianity in your face, unless you take the role of Amy to heart, which you should, because she was a teenage on-fire Christian and planning for the mission field. God had a different story in mind. Watch this film and see it revealed. Well done Mr. Dorsey, cast and crew.No subtitles, perhaps the only flaw.It has a commentary option in the bonus stuff.Dove Approved, family film, PureFlix 90 minutes",5,Powerful film sometimes comical sometimes heart wrenching,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,1845,"['Faith', 'Based', 'Filming', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'taking', 'place', 'alongside', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'flicks', 'shown', 'be', 'lower', 'budget', 'production', 'viewing', 'bonus', 'scenes', 'material', 'where', 'cast', 'double', 'filming', 'assistants', 'job', 'done', 'done', 'well', 'case', 'TRUE', 'story', 'perhaps', 'somewhat', 'altered', 'get', 'years', 'down', 'minutes', 'drama', 'certainly', 'encapsulated', 'story', 'Amy', 'Newhouse', 'battle', 'cancer', 'ups', 'downs', 'faith', 'hope', 'was', 'able', 'not', 'only', 'keep', 'herself', 'pass', 'others', 'ordeal.What', 'perfect', 'choice', 'was', 'cast', 'Anne', 'Underwood', 'Amy', 'joy', 'personified', 'bubbly', 'personality', 'contagious', 'right', 'screen', 'only', 'first', 'truly', 'believable', 'characters', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'mentioned', 'Paul', 'Willis', 'playing', 'teen', 'punk', 'hair', ""'m"", 'retired', 'teacher', 'believe', 'when', 'say', 'two', 'were', 'honestly', 'teen-realistic', ""'ve"", 'taught', 'hundreds', 'them.Bradley', 'Dorsey', 'Tyler', 'love', 'angle', 'Amy', 'life', 'part', 'so', 'young', 'lovesick', 'teen', 'boy', 'see', 'Scenes', 'see', 'director', 'also', 'writer', 'producer', 'editor', 'who', 'what', 'else', 'wait', 'Dec', '2012', 'new', 'film', 'be', 'released', 'many', 'roles', 'again', 'including', 'lead', 'joined', 'Della', 'Reese', 'Michael', 'Gross', 'step', 'definitely', 'faith', 'based', 'not', 'Christianity', 'face', 'take', 'role', 'Amy', 'heart', 'should', 'was', 'teenage', 'on-fire', 'Christian', 'planning', 'mission', 'field', 'God', 'had', 'different', 'story', 'mind', 'Watch', 'film', 'see', 'revealed', 'Well', 'done', 'Mr.', 'Dorsey', 'cast', 'crew.No', 'subtitles', 'perhaps', 'only', 'flaw.It', 'commentary', 'option', 'bonus', 'stuff.Dove', 'Approved', 'family', 'film', 'PureFlix', '90', 'minutes']",A Greater Yes: The Story of Amy Newhouse

It WILL bolster faith in God and evoke a high level of worthfulness in one's life, if it is dedicated to serving God. Acting was above par in the roles of Amy and the young agnostic she befriends. The rest, passable except for the two doctors who were terrible. You would think that the two characters who were so visible in the crisis in Amy's life would be more credible - no way! Production sequencing lacked as scenes seemed to keep repeating themselves. Thank God the message and strength of Amy's faith shown through and resulted in a faith strengthening vehicle.
