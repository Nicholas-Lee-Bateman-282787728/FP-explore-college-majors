Great message to deliver to young and older people.  I related to this movie because of my grandson and it brought me to tears as I watched the story unfold with the child finding his place in the family and developing a role and a voice that was so moving.

Based on my expectations, I found Tom Green to be displaying a surprising amount of his patented oddballery, including a just plain nasty scene involving a dead pig. Even his general manner of speech is irrepressably insane. I assumed if Tom Green agreed to do a movie like this he wouldn't try to impose his sense of humour on it, but it seems like he totally did. The opening scene where he loses his job at the fast food place seems like it was mostly his idea, and later he sits in a chair, spins around, and proclaims ""nice chair"", which has absolutely no context or relevence to anything so that was awesome. The build to the emotional crescendo of Bob and Anne ending up together was all forced and never seemed thought out or believable, but whatever, I guess it served it's purpose.",4,Please enter a title for your review,1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,975,"['thought', 'what', ""'d"", 'get', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'Tom', 'Green', 'just', 'acting', 'not', 'being', 'Tom', 'Green', 'was', ""n't"", 'confident', ""'d"", 'like', 'had', 'check', 'out', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'Based', 'expectations', 'found', 'Tom', 'Green', 'be', 'displaying', 'surprising', 'amount', 'patented', 'oddballery', 'including', 'just', 'plain', 'nasty', 'scene', 'involving', 'dead', 'pig', 'Even', 'general', 'manner', 'speech', 'irrepressably', 'insane', 'assumed', 'Tom', 'Green', 'agreed', 'do', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'try', 'impose', 'sense', 'humour', 'totally', 'did', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'job', 'fast', 'food', 'place', 'was', 'mostly', 'idea', 'later', 'chair', 'nice', 'chair', 'absolutely', 'context', 'relevence', 'anything', 'so', 'was', 'awesome', 'build', 'emotional', 'crescendo', 'Bob', 'Anne', 'ending', 'up', 'together', 'was', 'forced', 'never', 'seemed', 'thought', 'out', 'believable', 'whatever', 'guess', 'served', 'purpose']",N/A

He looks for jobs in alphabetical order in the Yellow Pages. He goes to Butler School, and is the only one to pass. Anne Jamieson is a single mom to Tess and Bates, who usually act like brats. Anne asks Bob to babysit, and becomes the new butler. Throughout the film, Bob becomes more of a father figure to Tess and Bates. Bates wants to be on the basketball team, so Bob tries to help with that, and Tess is going through a rebellious phase and tries robbing from a store, because of peer pressure. Bob is usually incompetent, but Anne begins to fall in love with him.
