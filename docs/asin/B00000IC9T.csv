Cicely Tyson who seems to be forever cast in these roles portrays the adult Flora, a woman who has survived prejudice from her own people, the hard and unfair life of sharecropping,the removal of her first newborn son of a ""high yellow"" plantation owner's son,the growing up of her children, the murder of her husband at the hands of white men,the inner conflicts of her own children and her ever present faith that gives her the inner fortitude to carry on.This is typically HALLMARK HALL OF FAME material made for television. The script is based upon some true characters from author of ROOTS Alex Haley's life.Unfortunately, the dialogue is pretty inane and the plot is formulaically predictable.MAMA FLORA'S does not have at all the intensity of ROOTS and seems very jammed into 140 minutes.Scenes and years fly by without proper time for real character development or time to digest anything.It seems that the writers seemed intent on cramming in 70 years of history without allowing much character conflict. What is there is very contrived despite all noble efforts to handle a very necessary subject.The talents of Queen Latifah, Blair Underwood and Mario Van Peebles are truly wasted in such a sanitized screenplay. The action and characters feel forced and contrived. Only Erika Alexander as the young woman Flora is allowed to show any depth of feeling in this ""chock-full-get-it-all-in"" made-for-television drama.HALLMARK lovers will adore this production.Everything is nice and tidy and ""safe"" in this 1998 melodrama epic.Anyone that demands more from scripts and actors will look elsewhere.One viewing will suffice.Better and more satisfying companion films would be WHEN WE WERE COLORED, THE COLOR PURPLE,BELOVED and THE GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI.",3,Stereotypes abound in the fly-by epic of Mama Flora's Family,1185148800,"07 23, 2007",2007,1875,"['MAMA', 'FLORA', 'FAMILY', 'sweeping', 'chronicle', 'seventy', 'years', 'life', 'descendants', 'one', 'Flora', 'Henning', 'Palmer', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'who', 'be', 'forever', 'cast', 'roles', 'portrays', 'adult', 'Flora', 'woman', 'who', 'survived', 'prejudice', 'own', 'people', 'hard', 'unfair', 'life', 'sharecropping', 'removal', 'first', 'newborn', 'son', 'high', 'yellow', 'plantation', 'owner', 'son', 'growing', 'children', 'murder', 'husband', 'hands', 'white', 'men', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'own', 'children', 'ever', 'present', 'faith', 'inner', 'fortitude', 'carry', 'on.This', 'typically', 'HALLMARK', 'HALL', 'OF', 'FAME', 'material', 'made', 'television', 'script', 'based', 'true', 'characters', 'author', 'ROOTS', 'Alex', 'Haley', 'life.Unfortunately', 'dialogue', 'pretty', 'inane', 'plot', 'formulaically', 'predictable.MAMA', 'FLORA', 'not', 'have', 'intensity', 'ROOTS', 'very', 'jammed', '140', 'minutes.Scenes', 'years', 'fly', 'proper', 'time', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'time', 'digest', 'anything.It', 'writers', 'seemed', 'intent', 'cramming', '70', 'years', 'history', 'allowing', 'much', 'character', 'conflict', 'What', 'very', 'contrived', 'noble', 'efforts', 'handle', 'very', 'necessary', 'subject.The', 'talents', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'Mario', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'are', 'truly', 'wasted', 'such', 'sanitized', 'screenplay', 'action', 'characters', 'feel', 'forced', 'contrived', 'Only', 'Erika', 'Alexander', 'young', 'woman', 'Flora', 'allowed', 'show', 'depth', 'feeling', 'chock-full-get-it-all-in', 'made-for-television', 'drama.HALLMARK', 'lovers', 'will', 'adore', 'production.Everything', 'nice', 'tidy', 'safe', '1998', 'melodrama', 'epic.Anyone', 'more', 'scripts', 'actors', 'will', 'look', 'elsewhere.One', 'viewing', 'will', 'suffice.Better', 'more', 'satisfying', 'companion', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'WE', 'WERE', 'COLORED', 'THE', 'COLOR', 'PURPLE', 'BELOVED', 'THE', 'GHOSTS', 'OF', 'MISSISSIPPI']",Mama Flora's Family VHS

I mean it is based on an Alex Haley book and full of great actors and actresses. Mama Flora (Cicely Tyson) is telling her life story to her granddaughter and great-grandchild. Young Mama Flora played by Erika Alexander brought me to tears.Young Flora steals the eye of young Lincoln Flemming (Shemar Moore).  Her family ""loans"" her to his familyto do housework and tend to an elder family member. Flora falls in love with Lincoln and experiences first love. When she finds out that he is also seeing other woman she turns his advances down. She is forced back home.  We see her give birth. She holds her baby crying that it is the happiest day of her life.  Lincoln rides up stating that he is there for the baby. It is taken from a drained Flora right after birth as she screams and cries.Her family ushers her out of town and she is on her own. She finds love again and has a son, Willie. When her husband is caught stealing for his families needs, he is shot and killed right in front of her.Floras wants her son to have a good life. Willie grows up, has three children, and when Flora's first son comes looking for her, the family must come to gripes with many obstacles and challenges.The movie is full of heartbreak, triumph, history, warmth, family and hope.I deserves a second viewing which I hope to do this week.

In this film, she carries elder Flora Henning Palmer with grace, dignity, class, strength and beauty despite the obstacles that her character has to face such as the cold-blooded murder of her husband as he was killed by white men for simply stealing cotton and they get away with it. The actress who plays young FLora does an excellent job in bringing the character to life. I believe it is Erika Alexander and she is fantastic as the mother, daughter, and sister who leaves her family behind in small town Mississippi after the birth of her baby that was ripped from her arms by his father. Della Reese has a small but unforgettable role as the grandmother Nana who is cared for by Flora. When Flora rejects her employer's advances, she is dismissed and sent home in disgrace where she give birth to a boy months later. Flora has known poverty almost her entire life. She goes to Baltimore to save her granddaughter played by Queen Latifah and her great-grandson. She begins to tell the story of her life such as the egg that was hers. There are brilliant scenes mostly because of Cicely Tyson's ability to capture the moment and scene. She sends chills down my spine because she is so brilliant in any role that she takes including the role of Flora.

Whenever mainstream America talks about &#34;family values&#34; and &#34;American families&#34; it's always a lilly white picture of &#34;the cleavers&#34; but the truth is that the story of American families has many faces, and &#34;family values&#34; are influenced by the history of trials and tribulations that a family goes through. This is a great example of that. This story is important, sentimental, educational, and heart warming. On top of that it has great performances by many great African American actors, as well as the phenomenal Miss Cicely Tyson who is an American stage and screen legend. This is great entertainment, and a different view of a American family that puts the cleavers to shame.",5,A Real American Story,1392336000,"02 14, 2014",2014,744,"['was', 'real', 'American', 'story', 'Whenever', 'mainstream', 'America', 'talks', '34', 'family', '34', '34', 'American', 'families', '34', 'always', 'lilly', 'white', 'picture', '34', 'cleavers', '34', 'truth', 'story', 'American', 'families', 'many', '34', 'family', '34', 'are', 'influenced', 'history', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'family', 'through', 'great', 'example', 'story', 'important', 'sentimental', 'educational', 'heart', 'warming', 'top', 'great', 'performances', 'many', 'great', 'African', 'American', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'phenomenal', 'Miss', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'who', 'American', 'stage', 'screen', 'legend', 'great', 'entertainment', 'different', 'view', 'American', 'family', 'cleavers', 'shame']",Mama Flora's Family VHS
