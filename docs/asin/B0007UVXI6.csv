891435,A1AMO32BKSEXIA,B0007UVXI6,"Kelly K. Patterson ""cormac""","[2, 3]","I'll say it right off the top, yes, this is a slow-paced presentation but it is slow-paced because it is thorough and goes into the finest detail to explain why these ""anomalies"" are important. For the average viewer who knows little about photography or especially the photography as it pertains to the difficult methods used to take photographs on the moon, these explainations are very important and are key to understanding why the angles and such on many famous photographs simply cannot be taken how they were said to have been taken. A chest-mounted camera without access to any kind of view-finder or focus mechanism makes the photographs examined obvious fakes -- or rather, genuine ""fakes"" in that they were of an astronaut on a soundstage but not of an astronaut on the moon.All of the time spent explaining all the various aspects of why the Apollo missions are dubious is important and if you dismiss the film because it's simply too boring and slow-paced you really don't have an argument saying the presenters don't prove their point or that it's silly to even think this. It's not the pace of the explaination, it's the quality of the explaination and this is the most thorough explaination of the subject available.Take an afternoon and do yourself a favor. Open your mind and truly let this examination sink in. Rewind and replay parts so you really understand what is being presented. You'll see things as they are.The simple fact of a photograph being taken with the sun directly behind your subject and still getting a clear image of the subject's side facing the camera is something you can ""prove"" in your own backyard. Go out and take a photo of a friend or family member with the sun over their shoulder as is shown in one of the most famous photographs ever presented of a ""man on the moon"". Don't use flash just as the astronauts had no extra lighting source and see what kind of photo you get ... you know what kind you'll get just reading this; it will be a near if not a complete silouhette of your subject. It's no different on the moon. This alone should start you questioning how all of the amazing photography was accomplished ... not to mention the other obstacles that lay between man and the moon such as the severe level of radiation you must pass through just to get to the moon without Apollo using any apparent protection at all.Don't simply dismiss this out of hand. Look at it seriously as the film-makers have and I think you'll say at the end that at the very least, some of this was faked ... and perhaps a great deal was faked. And as the film-makers say at several points, "" ... the images of NASA of a manned lunar landing are not the true and accurate record of such an event."" That is their ultimate point, their final statement on all of the information gathered and explained here. And that, my fellow American, in my humble opinion, is what they prove here in this film.Also, this is a 3 hour and 45 minute presentation, not a 5.5 hour as another reviewer stated ... so it's not THAT painfully long ;) lol(Also, by the way, the much shorter ""A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Moon"" which I have also watched along with its sequel, covers a good deal of the same information but it's ""exploitive"" in my opinion and a bit too sensational for me to recommend. Certainly, the fist-fights or near fist-fights its film-maker mostly instigates while ""interviewing"" astronauts as evidenced in his sequel, ""Astronauts Gone Wild"", I think says more about his efforts than his examination of the evidence. You can get anyone to take a swing at you if you work at it ... proving that the Apollo missions were at least partly faked is quite another thing and a serious matter in my opinion and should not be an exercise in taunting of interview subjects or even alleged outright stalking and harrassment which some of the subjects have stated in legal actions against the film-maker.)",5,Slow-paced?

891436,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,B0007UVXI6,Midge,"[20, 46]","I remember the entire race to the moon. I was convinced we had landed on the moon until a couple weeks ago when I saw the moon images for myself on the Navy's own Clementine satellite images stored on their own website for public display.Having been an  executive level engineer for 30 years, it was a shock to find out the truth for myself. While videos, documentaries and websites can always twist information.... take a look directly at the moon itself. I highly recommend going onto the Navy's own website and take a look at their moon satellite images, particularly around the extreme lunar north and south poles. There are mining operations, buildings, craft.. you name it and they are not ours. Some of the mining pits are a couple hundred miles across and you can see the mining in process. In some cases the Navy attempted to smudge out the large buildings but you can still see some of it. Others, they completely missed. Don't take my word for it. Look for yourself. Use the regional images on the Clementine lunar browser, copy the  images as a bmp format and blow them up 2x to 3x with a photo editor. Don't bother with the close up images on the Navy's site because they have deleted these files or substituted. However, you can still see the objects or interest in the area photos. (highest resolution)After reading Phil Corso's book ""The Day After Roswell"" where he described Nasa's of alien bases on the moon during their first orbit to take photos, I found the Navy's satellite image website to check the lunar area's Corso described. He was absolutely correct. They are located right where he said.. and then some.Don't take anyone's word for it. Look for yourself. It will take a few hours of scanning images for you to adjust your eyes to discerning particular objects in the rough terrain.Don't bother with the images on Nasa's website. They did massive editing of the photos.",4,need proof?
