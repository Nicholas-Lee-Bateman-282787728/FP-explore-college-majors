795956,AA1BKO3XQ1N8V,B00018YCIC,"Andrew ""Ciao""","[0, 0]","I think this program is worth seeing.  I bought it on a whim, never having seen it before.  I just know that Showtime puts out some great drama series, like ""Queer as Folk"" and ""Soul Food"", so I knew Resurrection Blvd. would be good too.  And it was.I like the authenticity of the show.  The characters are compelling and you develop a relationship with them as you watch the series.  The program is in English, and although some Spanish is spoken, it is always translated in the conversation of the actors, or easy to understand from the context of the specific scene.The writers demonstrate the importance of family in Mexican householdsm as well as the machismo.  I really feel for Yolanda, who works all day in a stressful job as a paralegal, only to come home and cook for 5 men, ""none of whom can even boil water"" as Aunt Bibi says!It's unfortunate that the writers only includes Caucasian characters to antagonize the Mexican family.  Aside from that, its a wonderful show.",4,Take a chance on the program,1081123200,"04 5, 2004",2004,980,"['think', 'program', 'worth', 'seeing', 'bought', 'whim', 'never', 'having', 'seen', 'just', 'know', 'Showtime', 'out', 'great', 'drama', 'series', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'Soul', 'Food', 'knew', 'Resurrection', 'Blvd', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'too', 'authenticity', 'show', 'characters', 'are', 'compelling', 'develop', 'relationship', 'watch', 'series', 'program', 'English', 'Spanish', 'spoken', 'always', 'translated', 'conversation', 'actors', 'easy', 'understand', 'context', 'specific', 'scene.The', 'writers', 'demonstrate', 'importance', 'family', 'Mexican', 'householdsm', 'as', 'well', 'machismo', 'really', 'feel', 'Yolanda', 'who', 'day', 'stressful', 'job', 'paralegal', 'only', 'come', 'home', 'cook', '5', 'men', 'none', 'whom', 'can', 'even', 'boil', 'water', 'Aunt', 'Bibi', 'unfortunate', 'writers', 'only', 'Caucasian', 'characters', 'antagonize', 'Mexican', 'family', 'Aside', 'wonderful', 'show']",N/A

Recently I've been renting TV shows. At first I didnt even look at renting this. I'll be truthful. I didnt believe I would like a film made up of all latinos. I didnt think I could relate to it. I was definitely wrong. I enjoyed everything about it. The acting and storyline was awesome. It wasnt just about boxing. It was about family struggles. I literally watched every episode back to back. I liked how it showed how mexicans valued their family. That's one thing I wish the white culture could do better. I've read most of the reviews and they are mostly written by mexicans. I wanted to write one so all other cultures would know this is a great show regardless of what race you are. I cant believe they cancelled this show. Maybe if they advertised the show differently, other races would have given it a chance. For example, the titles of each show was written in spanish. I couldnt even tell you what they said. Well its sad that it was cancelled though. I wanted to see the sons and the father get together again and win the world title.",5,Excellent Series and I'm not Mexican/Latino!!!!,1098662400,"10 25, 2004",2004,1150,"['was', 'great', 'show', 'have', 'blockbuster', 'movie', 'ticket', 'can', 'rent', 'many', 'movies', 'like', 'Recently', ""'ve"", 'been', 'renting', 'TV', 'shows', 'first', 'didnt', 'even', 'look', 'renting', ""'ll"", 'be', 'truthful', 'didnt', 'believe', 'would', 'like', 'film', 'made', 'latinos', 'didnt', 'think', 'could', 'relate', 'was', 'definitely', 'wrong', 'enjoyed', 'everything', 'acting', 'storyline', 'was', 'awesome', 'just', 'boxing', 'was', 'family', 'struggles', 'literally', 'watched', 'episode', 'back', 'back', 'liked', 'how', 'showed', 'how', 'mexicans', 'valued', 'family', 'one', 'thing', 'wish', 'white', 'culture', 'could', 'do', 'better', ""'ve"", 'read', 'most', 'reviews', 'are', 'mostly', 'written', 'mexicans', 'wanted', 'write', 'one', 'so', 'other', 'cultures', 'would', 'know', 'great', 'show', 'regardless', 'what', 'race', 'are', 'cant', 'believe', 'cancelled', 'show', 'Maybe', 'advertised', 'show', 'differently', 'other', 'races', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'chance', 'example', 'titles', 'show', 'was', 'written', 'spanish', 'couldnt', 'even', 'tell', 'what', 'said', 'Well', 'sad', 'was', 'cancelled', 'wanted', 'see', 'sons', 'father', 'get', 'together', 'again', 'win', 'world', 'title']",N/A

That's not so great when an episode is just under 60 minutes. If you end up getting interrupted (as I always seem to do) you then have to start looking from the beginning of the episode for where you left off.There are no subtitles. This series is mostly in English but includes a lot of Spanish dialogue. Subtitles here in one or the other or both of those languages would be great. I speak English (y un peque&ntilde;o espanol) but I would definately benefit from subtitles so that I can pick up the dialogue that goes by too quickly for me.I've got no complaints with the quality of the video transfer or the sound both are crisp and well done.,3,Great series - Badly planned DVD,1093564800,"08 27, 2004",2004,819,"['recently', 'got', 'DVD', 'love', 'series', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'releasing', 'DVD.It', 'none', 'episodes', 'have', 'chaptering', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'when', 'episode', 'just', '60', 'minutes', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'interrupted', 'always', 'seem', 'do', 'then', 'have', 'start', 'looking', 'beginning', 'episode', 'where', 'left', 'are', 'subtitles', 'series', 'mostly', 'English', 'lot', 'Spanish', 'dialogue', 'Subtitles', 'here', 'one', 'other', 'languages', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'speak', 'English', 'y', 'un', 'peque', 'ntilde', 'espanol', 'would', 'definately', 'benefit', 'subtitles', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'dialogue', 'too', 'quickly', 'me.I', ""'ve"", 'got', 'complaints', 'quality', 'video', 'transfer', 'sound', 'are', 'crisp', 'well', 'done']",N/A

With Resurrection Blvd. I notice that no one has put forth a review for a few years now.  Depending on your point of view, if you are not a boxing fan, this series comes across as a soap opera revolving around boxing.  If you are a boxing fan, it is not so much a soap opera as  a behind the scenes look at a sport we love and all of the things going on while dedicating yourself to what is without doubt, the most physically demanding of all sports.I won't add or dismiss anything already said here in prior reviews as it parallels my own thoughts.  But I ask this: Why haven't the other two remaining seasons been released on DVD?The saga of the Santiago family continues for several more episodes and the quality of the series doesn't miss a beat.I'm not going to reveal the eventual outcome of the various characters here but it would be nice if SHOWTIME would release the remaining episodes of the series so that those of us who love this series, can enjoy it.The series is in syndication on SITV but is edited for content and language and so not worth watching except for those who don't know any better.This is a 5 DVD set.  It's a real steal for less than $10.  Not only does this series provide a ""Boxing 101"" but also provides family values, real life situations which are not always pleasant but are honest and realistic enough to be able to relate to.",5,Where are the remaining episodes of this series??,1279670400,"07 21, 2010",2010,1429,"['time', 'time', ""'ll"", 'read', 'reviews', 'items', 'own', 'Resurrection', 'Blvd', 'notice', 'one', 'put', 'forth', 'review', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'Depending', 'point', 'view', 'are', 'not', 'boxing', 'fan', 'series', 'soap', 'opera', 'revolving', 'boxing', 'are', 'boxing', 'fan', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'soap', 'opera', 'scenes', 'look', 'sport', 'love', 'things', 'going', 'dedicating', 'what', 'doubt', 'most', 'physically', 'demanding', 'sports.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'add', 'dismiss', 'anything', 'already', 'said', 'here', 'prior', 'reviews', 'own', 'thoughts', 'ask', 'Why', 'have', ""n't"", 'other', 'two', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'saga', 'Santiago', 'family', 'several', 'more', 'episodes', 'quality', 'series', ""n't"", 'miss', 'beat.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'reveal', 'eventual', 'outcome', 'various', 'characters', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'SHOWTIME', 'would', 'release', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'series', 'who', 'love', 'series', 'can', 'enjoy', 'it.The', 'series', 'syndication', 'SITV', 'edited', 'content', 'language', 'so', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'better.This', '5', 'DVD', 'set', 'real', 'steal', 'less', '10', 'Not', 'only', 'series', 'provide', 'Boxing', '101', 'also', 'family', 'values', 'real', 'life', 'situations', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'pleasant', 'are', 'honest', 'realistic', 'enough', 'be', 'able', 'relate']",N/A
