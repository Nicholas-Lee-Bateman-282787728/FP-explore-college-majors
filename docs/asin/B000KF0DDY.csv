I love Seth Green's character as well.  I watch this movie at least a couple of times a year.  My GF liked it too, but not as much as me.I watched it with my mom the other day and she HATED it!!!  She should it was super boring and kept turning to me and asking &#34;Do you really like this???&#34;.  That made me sad, but I still love it and recommend it.I first saw a pirated version of the British version of this movie called 'The Best Man', but now I own a dvd and a blu-ray copy!Rent it and see what you think :)",5,"I love this movie, my mom hated this movie :(",1376870400,"08 19, 2013",2013,730,"['love', 'movie', 'have', 'total', 'man', 'crush', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'think', 'movie', 'funny', 'main', 'character', 'actually', 'good', 'person', 'becoming', 'kind', 'rare', 'days', 'especially', 'comedy', 'love', 'Seth', 'Green', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'watch', 'movie', 'least', 'couple', 'times', 'year', 'My', 'GF', 'liked', 'too', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'me.I', 'watched', 'mom', 'other', 'day', 'HATED', 'should', 'was', 'super', 'boring', 'kept', 'turning', 'asking', '34', 'Do', 'really', '34', 'made', 'sad', 'still', 'love', 'recommend', 'it.I', 'first', 'saw', 'pirated', 'version', 'British', 'version', 'movie', 'called', ""'The"", 'Best', 'Man', 'now', 'own', 'dvd', 'blu-ray', 'copy', 'Rent', 'see', 'what', 'think']",N/A
1033253,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000KF0DDY,Brian E. Erland,"[10, 12]","Synopsis: Olly (Stuart Townsend) is a struggling young writer suffering from a severe case of writers block. Frustrated by his lose of creativity he loses confidence in other aspects of his life as well and becomes somewhat of a loner. That is until he is unexpectedly contacted by his best friend from his college days who asks him to be the best man at his upcoming wedding. Olly reluctantly accepts, but when he finally meets Sarah (Amy Smart), the bride-to-be, he finds himself in a further quandary. He has unintentionally fallen madly in love with his best friends wife.The newly released '06 film `Unhitched' is a totally original romantic comedy containing an ingenious, highly original storyline unlike anything else that's ever graced the movie screen. Where do these great ideas come from, a love triangle between bride, groom and best man! That's never been done before...., OK it has been done and there's nothing new and original in this little unpretentious film. It is however an entertaining and enjoyable watch with a likeable cast that will bring you back for a repeat viewing or two if you like this genre of film. Seth Green is particularly good as Murray, Olly's childhood friend and current roommate.My Rating: 3 1/2 Stars",3,"""I Thought He Meant Funny Ha-Ha"" ~ Overcoming Writer's Block And Reclaiming Your Inspiration",1172016000,"02 21, 2007",2007,1245,"['Synopsis', 'Olly', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'struggling', 'young', 'writer', 'suffering', 'severe', 'case', 'writers', 'block', 'Frustrated', 'lose', 'creativity', 'confidence', 'other', 'aspects', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'somewhat', 'loner', 'unexpectedly', 'contacted', 'best', 'friend', 'college', 'days', 'who', 'asks', 'be', 'best', 'man', 'upcoming', 'wedding', 'Olly', 'reluctantly', 'when', 'finally', 'Sarah', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'bride-to-be', 'further', 'quandary', 'unintentionally', 'fallen', 'madly', 'love', 'best', 'wife.The', 'newly', 'released', 'film', 'Unhitched', 'totally', 'original', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'containing', 'ingenious', 'highly', 'original', 'storyline', 'anything', 'else', 'ever', 'graced', 'movie', 'screen', 'Where', 'do', 'great', 'ideas', 'come', 'love', 'triangle', 'bride', 'groom', 'best', 'man', 'never', 'been', 'done', 'been', 'done', 'nothing', 'new', 'original', 'little', 'unpretentious', 'film', 'however', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'likeable', 'cast', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'two', 'like', 'genre', 'film', 'Seth', 'Green', 'particularly', 'good', 'Murray', 'Olly', 'childhood', 'friend', 'current', 'roommate.My', 'Rating', '3', '1/2', 'Stars']",N/A

But so many of these kinds of movies now are just cliche and predictable stories. What a shame, as these actors could have done wonders with a little better material.

1033256,A278AF56R7J86,B000KF0DDY,"C. Crockett ""Domino713""","[8, 10]","The story told in this film is as old as time, but it continues to get recycled and re-released each year with a flashy new name and a new cast. Still...this one wasn't bad, and it certainly has some hilarious moments, which are a credit to this worn-out tale.This movie is about a young man (Stuart Townsend) who is flattered to be named Best Man in his friend's wedding! However, wacky hijinks ensue when he falls in love with the bride-to-be (Amy Smart), and begins to work with his fellow groomsmen (Seth Green) to stop the wedding, and get the girl. They attempt to show the bride what a lying, cheating jerk she's about to marry, and that the 'best man' should win.The 'wacky hijinks' include gags as old as dinosaurs (who really falls for the 'wrong church' routine? Honestly!), but despite that, there are some real gems of comedy mixed in with so much recycled material. Seth Green is a real pleasure to watch, and he fits perfectly into his role as instigator and enabler to the groomsmen's misadventures. Stuart Townsend, better known for his roles in dramas and thrillers, steps a little out of his comfort zone in this role by attempting comedy, and romantic comedy at that! While at times it's obvious that he's not used to playing the bumbling, clumsy love interest, Townsend still delivers a believable and heart-warming performance (although Seth Green still shines a little brighter).Bottom line, it's a good romantic comedy if you don't have your heart set on seeing anything original. Then again, Hollywood tends to recycle material all the time, so maybe we shouldn't fault this movie too much for that. I guess if it wasn't *good* material, it wouldn't get recycled, right? Either way, it's an entertaining film, and I enjoyed it.",4,Lovable and laughable attempt at the romantic comedy genre...but it pulls it off...,1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,1752,"['story', 'told', 'film', 'as', 'old', 'time', 'get', 'recycled', 're-released', 'year', 'flashy', 'new', 'name', 'new', 'cast', 'Still', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'certainly', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'are', 'credit', 'worn-out', 'tale.This', 'movie', 'young', 'man', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'who', 'flattered', 'be', 'named', 'Best', 'Man', 'friend', 'wedding', 'However', 'wacky', 'hijinks', 'ensue', 'when', 'love', 'bride-to-be', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'work', 'fellow', 'groomsmen', 'Seth', 'Green', 'stop', 'wedding', 'get', 'girl', 'attempt', 'show', 'bride', 'what', 'lying', 'cheating', 'jerk', 'marry', ""'best"", 'man', 'should', 'win.The', ""'wacky"", 'hijinks', 'include', 'gags', 'as', 'old', 'dinosaurs', 'who', 'really', ""'wrong"", 'church', 'routine', 'Honestly', 'are', 'real', 'gems', 'comedy', 'mixed', 'so', 'much', 'recycled', 'material', 'Seth', 'Green', 'real', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'perfectly', 'role', 'instigator', 'enabler', 'groomsmen', 'misadventures', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'better', 'known', 'roles', 'dramas', 'thrillers', 'little', 'comfort', 'zone', 'role', 'attempting', 'comedy', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'times', 'obvious', 'not', 'used', 'playing', 'bumbling', 'clumsy', 'love', 'interest', 'Townsend', 'still', 'believable', 'heart-warming', 'performance', 'Seth', 'Green', 'still', 'little', 'brighter', '.Bottom', 'line', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'heart', 'set', 'seeing', 'anything', 'original', 'Then', 'again', 'Hollywood', 'recycle', 'material', 'time', 'so', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'fault', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'guess', 'was', ""n't"", '*good*', 'material', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'recycled', 'right', 'way', 'entertaining', 'film', 'enjoyed']",N/A
1033257,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000KF0DDY,Grady Harp,"[5, 7]","UNHITCHED is a fairly well made, generic Hollywood love story that provides a reasonably entertaining evening because of the actors cast in the roles.  The story by director Stefan Schwartz and Ed Roe is recycled fluff with nothing new added, yet despite that fact the pacing and acting bring off a fun little film.As marriage enters the agenda of old friends, promiscuous James (Steve John Shepherd) is scheduled to marry Sarah (Amy Smart, always a pleasure to watch) and asks his best friend Olly (the talented and hunky Irishman Stuart Townsend in a very nice comedic turn) to be his Best Man.  Olly, a writer whose first chapters have been lauded by his publisher (Simon Callow) and that early praise has thrown him into writer's block forcing him to take a menial job as a PA under grumpy feminist Tania (Johdi May), fears accepting the role of Best Man out of the challenge tied to writing the wedding reception speech.  He is encouraged not to accept the role by his roommate friend Murray (5'4"" Seth Green, who has many comedy roles to his credit - this one being the first with a fine British accent). Murray knows of James' peppered past and sets out to stop the wedding - especially when he discovers that Olly has fallen for Sarah, mistaking her for Sarah's Maid of Honor Becka (Kate Ashfield).Olly is a true friend and will sacrifice his longing for Sarah out of his loyalty to James - until Murray proves that James indeed is a promiscuous lothario.  And the chase, with many a pratfall, begins as Olly ultimately sides with Murray to prevent his losing Sarah.Townsend makes a fine turn out of his obvious role, proving that he not only can master dramatic and intrigue roles, but light comedy ones as well.  Seth Green may be small but he is a powerhouse of physical comedic talent.  Amy Smart doesn't have much to do, but when she is on screen she glows with intelligence as well as beauty.  It is the cast that makes this film work and they are enough of a pleasure to watch to merit sitting through another re-telling of a tired story.
