After a cop (Michael Nouri) loses his partner to a ruthless serial murderer, he becomes Dr. Newman's patient. She begins having visions of the incident, apparently seeing through the eyes of the victim. She starts sleuthing around on her own, finding clues that help to flesh out what happened. Jesse soon sees that things just might be a bit more complicated -and far more dangerous- than they seem. As she pieces the puzzle together, it's increasingly clear that something just isn't right.

Newman, who has some psychic abilities, gets involved in the investigation of the death of a San Francisco cop, when she is brought in to counsel the dead man's partner (Michael Nouri).There are a number of familiar themes, as Jesse has flashes of insight, and begins to take a more active role, while also trying to be a good mother to her daughter Kimberly (Missy Crider).  Dependable Barbara Eden, gives a good performance, and the story stays fairly grounded, until the very end, when Newman and her daughter are threatened.
