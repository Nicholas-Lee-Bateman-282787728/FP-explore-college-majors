893836,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B0007XG2ZM,David Baldwin,"[6, 7]","""The Blockhouse"" is a film rife with good intentions but, alas, good intentions do not a great film make.  It is noble of the filmmakers to portray men in a desperate situation trying to maintain their spirits and sanity.  That said, even at the 92 minutes that the film clocks in at it's difficult for the viewer to retain their spirits let alone interest.  Director Clive Rees films the men trapped in an underground bunker in natural candlelight and it appears that he allows his international cast, led by Peter Sellers, to improvise with no music to cue our emotions.  In this regard the film is only marginally successful.  It's not to say that this cannot be effective.  Some may laugh, but think of Tom Hanks in Robert Zemeckis' ""Castaway"".  As for Peter Sellers, some may think this is a vanity project for him but it's anything but.  Sellers is effectively subdued in a rare dramatic role for him and graciously shares the screen with his supporting cast.",3,Experimental Film That's Not Wholly Successful,1128902400,"10 10, 2005",2005,965,"['Blockhouse', 'film', 'rife', 'good', 'intentions', 'alas', 'good', 'intentions', 'do', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'make', 'noble', 'filmmakers', 'portray', 'men', 'desperate', 'situation', 'trying', 'maintain', 'spirits', 'sanity', 'said', 'even', '92', 'minutes', 'film', 'clocks', 'difficult', 'viewer', 'retain', 'spirits', 'let', 'alone', 'interest', 'Director', 'Clive', 'Rees', 'films', 'men', 'trapped', 'underground', 'bunker', 'natural', 'candlelight', 'international', 'cast', 'led', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'improvise', 'music', 'cue', 'emotions', 'regard', 'film', 'only', 'marginally', 'successful', 'not', 'say', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'effective', 'may', 'laugh', 'think', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'Castaway', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'may', 'think', 'vanity', 'project', 'anything', 'Sellers', 'effectively', 'subdued', 'rare', 'dramatic', 'role', 'graciously', 'shares', 'screen', 'supporting', 'cast']",The Blockhouse

893838,A6TCG0EBKYQJS,B0007XG2ZM,"Kenneth Gillespie ""K.A.Gillespie""","[4, 6]","Since no one has reviewed this film, I will give it a go. This is the true and unbelievable story of 7 - 8 men on D-Day June 6, 1944. During the allied bombing on that day forced laborers took cover in a german blockhouse (underground bunker) which held supplies such as food and ammo. These bunkers led deep underground. The bombing was so heavy that it actually burried these 7 - 8 men alive (there are conflicking reports on how many were actually burried, 7 or 8. From what I read (and this is pretty accurate), there they stayed. In 1952 while a construction team worked near the beach area, they removed some debree, and from out of the ground appeared some of these men, still alive, while history passed them by. What happened during that time? That is what this film evolves around. With the bombing, all electricity was virtually destroyed underground. This is probabally one of the most dismal and at various times boring films you will ever see, but just the same, it is interesting to watch. Action? Just a bit at the beginning during the bombing. Apparently there was a book put out about this event, but I believe it is out of print, and there is not much on the internet about it. I would not call this a war film, but a survival film. Peter Sellers blends in with the rest of the unknown cast, and there is no humor here. Watch it as a late night film, in the dark, because about 85 - 90 percent of the film is in the dark. The MGM release should be a lot more clearer in viewing then the older VHS release (by Paragon Video).

Rivers,"[2, 2]","Based on the true story of seven Allied prisoners sealed inside an underground German bunker after the D-Day invasion, ""The Blockhouse"" is a hidden gem in the Peter Sellers filmography. Director Clive Rees transforms this claustrophobic nightmare into a quietly effective drama. Sellers' detailed performance as the French teacher is a revelation - ample proof that he could step outside the comedic realm. Charles Aznavour, Jeremy Kemp and Peter Vaughan give equally compelling portrayals in a strong ensemble cast. ""The Blockhouse"" was shown at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1973 and then unceremoniously buried in a British vault. Except for a few screenings, the film remained unseen until its VHS debut in the mid-1980s. This DVD release includes the widescreen version with better sound and picture quality.

893840,A1NBYOPCDBG0B3,B0007XG2ZM,Shirley Pena,"[1, 1]","I'll wager a bet than most Americans-even Seller's most devoted fans-have never even heard of(much less seen)this terrific film.In my opinion, that is a real shame, as this is a straight DRAMATIC role, the exact kind that Sellers got too few chances to perform and-in my humble opinion-was every bit as creative and effective in as his signature comedic roles.Set in a dim, dreary, claustrophobic WWII bunker(lit exclusively by candlelight)it's poignant yet entirely without a trace of maudlin, in it's tale of a ragtag group of labor camp prisoners trapped for a harrowing six years beneath a German bunker, struggling to keep themselves alive body and soul.  The bunker is well-stocked with food, beverages, etc. yet the body count continues to rise notwithstanding.  The film's message is clear:for Man to sustain life(and the very desire to KEEP alive), then love, affection and GENUINE caring is AT LEAST as necessary as supplying the body with it's more rudimentary needs of food, water, etc.Sellers really tore at my heart with his simply stunning, unadorned portrayal of a French school teacher who's intent on sustaining the spirit to survive in his fellow prisoners. His quiet strength of character makes this one of my all-time favourite roles that Sellers created in his long film career.  Those sad, dark, empty eyes of his stayed in my psyche LONG after the movie had ended.Had the screenwriter given Sellers not one word to utter through the entire film, his performance would STILL have touched my heart deeply.Note:this excellent film is FINALLY available on a U.S. playable format!

893841,A1UO0RKVNCS6PR,B0007XG2ZM,S. Hoben,"[0, 0]","The Blockhouse is a movie about six men forced into work camps by the Nazi's in World War II. On the day of the 1944 Normandy invasion the allies shelled the beaches, these men were forced to take shelter in a concrete bunker/blockhouse. These six  men took shelter all the way into the blockhouse, the bombing had blocked all the exits.  The men were able to find candles and stacks of food for German officers that would last them for years, little did they realize that it would take until 1951 before they would be found by a French work crew. Only two men survived. It was estimated that they had run out of candles and were in complete darkness for at least four years. The film quality is not the greatest, but the acting and directing are so good that I had to pause this film every so often and run outside for fresh air. Do not watch this if you are claustrophobic it will make you panic. This is a gritty movie and not for the faint of heart, but I loved it. Sellers and Kemp are excellent actors and it was worth watching their performances.I gave the movie four stars only because the film quality was not great.",4,The blocKhouse excellent movie,1320278400,"11 3, 2011",2011,1125,"['Blockhouse', 'movie', 'six', 'men', 'forced', 'work', 'camps', 'Nazi', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'day', '1944', 'Normandy', 'invasion', 'allies', 'shelled', 'beaches', 'men', 'were', 'forced', 'take', 'shelter', 'concrete', 'bunker/blockhouse', 'six', 'men', 'took', 'shelter', 'way', 'blockhouse', 'bombing', 'had', 'blocked', 'exits', 'men', 'were', 'able', 'find', 'candles', 'stacks', 'food', 'German', 'officers', 'would', 'last', 'years', 'little', 'did', 'realize', 'would', 'take', '1951', 'would', 'be', 'found', 'French', 'work', 'crew', 'Only', 'two', 'men', 'survived', 'was', 'estimated', 'had', 'run', 'candles', 'were', 'complete', 'darkness', 'least', 'four', 'years', 'film', 'quality', 'not', 'greatest', 'acting', 'directing', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'had', 'pause', 'film', 'so', 'often', 'run', 'outside', 'fresh', 'air', 'Do', 'not', 'watch', 'are', 'claustrophobic', 'will', 'make', 'panic', 'gritty', 'movie', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'loved', 'Sellers', 'Kemp', 'are', 'excellent', 'actors', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'performances.I', 'gave', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'only', 'film', 'quality', 'was', 'not', 'great']",The Blockhouse
