226901,A2YRKEKFPX2BH4,6300247651,Andrew,"[5, 7]","This was a disturbing tale about a woman who suffers supernatural attacks.  On a deeper level, it is about her finding strength to persevere through sexual assault (albeit from a spirit) and culture's refusal to take her seriously.  The feminist undertones are fitting for the period's waning of the initial movement and the attacks the movement saw in the early 80s.  And fitting for our current era, as well.  As one reviewer pointed out, the camera's refusal to focus on some of the male characters makes the viewer know that we are to dismiss the men's arrogance as easily as they dismissed this woman.I had no intention of writing a review, but I found some reviews to be disturbing in themselves.  The fact that several people mentioned they found the rape scenes to be funny makes a sad comment on our culture.  Sure, it was a ghost...sure, it was a chessy special effect... but just sad when people (and I hope not just my male gender) found this funny.  Empathy, people!!  The scenes are graphic, but the violence and nudity are not grotesque.  Barbara Hershey was not 'taken advantage of' as one kid review mentioned (why does Amazon let children comment on R movies?  As if they understand mature sexuality- most adults can't deal with it!...if they are 'embarrassed' by nudity, then pipe down!).  Instead, it showed pretty amazing strength to film a movie that could have tanked given 1982's social climate.

The older boy is attacked and just doesn't seem to have any emotional issues afterword.  I attribute this to the genre and the time period it was made.  Also, the music is very grating especially during the attacks.  This is actually a positive because it really gets to you and makes the attacks that much more.

Barbara Hershey turns in a very heartfelt performance as a single mom who's had some pretty traumatic experiences in her life that are the basis for her shrink's accusations of delusions when she begins to feel some sort of entity sexually assault her in her own house. The sequences of rape by an un-earthly force are extremely effective, and the pitter-patter in between isn't bad, either.

226915,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6300247651,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[5, 8]","The Entity (1981), a fictionalized account based on a `true' incident, relates a tale of how a single mother in California suffered brutal attacks by unseen forces.  Taken from the popular novel by Frank De Felitta and directed by Sidney J. Furie (The Ipcress File, Iron Eagle, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace), the film stars Barbara Hershey (Hoosiers, Tin Men).  Also appearing is Ron Silver (Silkwood), George Coe (The Omega Code), Margaret Blye (Mischief), Jacqueline Brookes (Ghost Story), Richard Brestoff (The Man with Two Brains), Raymond Singer (Feds), Alex `Moe Green' Rocco (The Godfather), Natasha Ryan (The Amityville Horror), Melanie Gaffin (Armed and Dangerous), and David Labiosa, whom many may be familiar with from his appearance as the character of Antonio the busboy from the ""Seinfeld"" episode The Busboy.Carla Moran (Hershey) is a single mother, who works during the day and goes to school at night, drives a funky car and lives in a funky rental house with her three children.  After returning home one night she suffers a brutal, penetrating attack by an unseen aggressor, one that's real enough to her to believe her attacker is a corporeal being in the house (he's not).  Her oldest son Bill (Labiosa) writes it off as a bad dream, but the amorous, groping, invisible entity soon returns on a regular basis causing Carla to think she possibly losing her marbles, to which she seeks professional help from a psychiatrist named Dr. Sneiderman (Silver).  As Sneiderman begins probing Carla's background he believes the attacks are all apart of some delusion, stemming from her sketchy past, but the incidents continue and grow in intensity, eventually witnessed by others around Carla, including her children (at one point she suffers various bruises and bite marks upon her body).  Eventually a disillusioned Carla, after a falling out with Sneiderman, comes into contact with a couple of university funded parapsychologists named Gene (Brestoff) and Joe (Singer) who later witness some of the strangeness, and they agree to get involved not only to document the powerful force but to also help Carla, much to Dr. Sneiderman annoyance who thinks such intervention by those he presumes quacks will only feed the delusion.  Anyway, as the unusual activity continues the parapsychologists look for a way to isolate and immobilize the force, resulting in a grand and elaborate experiment in a university gymnasium where they use a willing Carla as the bait (once Sneiderman gets wind of what's going on, he flips his proverbial lid and tries to intervene), the hope being to capture that force which they believe to have crossed over from another plane of existence (apparently looking for a good time).I'm not a big believer in the supernatural but I am perfectly willing to admit there's a lot of stuff going on out there that we, for some reason or another, just can't explain.  Whether or not part or most of what's relating in this film actually occurred I do not know, but it certainly made for an interesting and unnerving film, especially if you like well developed ghost stories with an intellectual slant.  I thought Ms. Hershey did a really wonderful job portraying a woman fighting to keep her wits, struggling to come to terms with those who would have her believe her very real experiences were all just a product of her fractured mind.  One aspect of the film I really enjoyed was the animosity displayed between the established medical community, represented by Dr. Sneiderman, and the pseudo science of the paranormal, represented mainly by Gene and Joe, whom, by the way, were a real couple of nerdlingers (check out the scene when they're in Carla's bedroom and some static electricity appears in the air...the both dive for the floor in fright).  There's one sort of funny scene when Sneiderman's in a staff meeting with his peers with Carla present, and after she leaves nearly everyone lights up (one guy's smoking a pipe, another a cigar, and most of the rest pull out cigarettes).  I'm not entirely sure why I found this humorous, but perhaps it has something to do with seeing all these medical professionals engaging in an activity we now know to be detrimental to one's health.  Anyway, I thought the film, which ran just over two hours, was pretty solid all the way around, including the flow of the story, the special effects (which were understated enough to appear real), the performances, and the direction.  Furie and his cinematographer Stephen H. Burum (The Untouchables, Mission: Impossible) did employ some interesting camera slanted angle shots and tight close ups, most likely to create a heightened sense of tension, and they usually worked, on me at least.  As I said the film runs just over two hours, and I thought the time was used well.  The only element I thought a little off was the ending, during the grand experiment meant to try and capture the entity.  I won't go into specifics but despite not being familiar with the source material, I highly doubt this `Ghostbusters' sequence was something that actually took place.  Most likely it was a spectacular element tacked on to the film in an effort to provide a whiz-bang of a finale.  It was interesting, but it felt at odds with the rest of the story in terms of up until that point there felt a certain sense of disturbing realism steeped in the fantastic, whereas the ending moved into the realm of the ultra fantastic.  I did like their train of thought in as far as how they were planning to capture the entity, but, again, it didn't seem to fit well with everything that occurred previously given most of what's depicted is supposedly culled from actual events.  That's not to say the ending ruined the film, but only that it takes away slightly from everything else that came before.The picture on this Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD release, presented in widescreen (2.35:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, looks very sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround comes through very well.  Extras include a newly created and entertaining documentary titled The Entity Files (27:28) featuring a real life parapsychologist named Dr. Barry Taff who shares some of his experiences (he was involved in the true life events from which provide the basis of the film), a theatrical trailer, a poster and still gallery, and an original screenplay accessible as a DVD-ROM feature.Cookieman108By the way, I saw on the Internet Movie Database website there's a remake of this film in the works, tentatively scheduled for a 2008 release.

226916,A1YXGVAKHLCL26,6300247651,CryWolf854,"[1, 2]","Night after night, it takes her against her will and has its way with her until the day she started fighting back.Yeah I know it sounds corny but I couldn't help myself without giving The Entity the Lifetime treatment tagline.Seriously, though, this is a pretty scary movie aided with a really strong performance by Barbara Hershey. She plays Carla Morran, a single mother of three living in a lower middle class suburb and trying to better herself and family by taking a few night courses at the community college. One night, while getting ready for bed, she is inexplicably attacked and assaulted by some unseen force. The attacks continued until she finally convinces a pair of skeptical parapsychologists that she is in fact being raped by a ghost. Together with a team of twenty students, this unlikely trio of Ghostbusters try to uncover the truth behind the ghostly attacks and possibly end the Entity's reign of terror.I really must admit that the story behind the movie is even scarier though I do have trouble believing a lot of it.  First off, the real woman (""Doris"") had a tragic history of physical as well as sexual abuse which she supposedly never sought treatment for in her later years. Then there's the fact that she drank like a fish and treated her three sons like crap while intoxicated and, in turn, her sons felt a lot of rage towards her. There is also a possible link to repressed sexual desires towards her eldest son who was between 16 and 18 at the time the attacks first manifested.  She went on by saying that the Entity was actually three spirits; the two smaller ones would hold her down while the larger one, the one in charge, would then begin the rape. So you got 3 spirits (each one representing her sons), drinking, and a traumatic past all colliding together in an explosion of psychokinetic energy. But this is only my theory and I'm no shrink or paranormal investigator.As a whole the movie is a good one. The SFX leave a lot to be desired but what do yo expect from a low budget movie from the early 80s?  By far Barbara Hershey is the stand out here. She plays Carla as a very strong woman who is forced to undergo some real fantastical extremes in an attempt to reclaim personal possession. Ron Silver, on the other hand, plays a pretty sleazy character in my opinion. I didn't trust or like him the moment he came on screen the first time nor has that feeling change over subsequent viewings over the years. You can tell he doesn't care about her. To him its all about the publishing and the credit this case will provide him with. I was actually hoping that in the end the Entity would leave Carla alone and start raping him.The first 2/3 of movie is really strong but that strength seems to vanish during the last act of the film where the team tries to recreate Carla's house in a gymnasium of all places in an attempt to lure and trap the Entity by freezing it. Then we only find out that after this failed disaster, the ghost followed Carla back home and THE END. All this and the movie just ends. For this poorly concieved ending, I'm deducting a star but its still a powerful scary movie that may leave a few of the uninitiated a few sleepless nights. Unfortunately, the disc has once again returned to the realm of OOP dvds and a few sellers are attempting to rape your wallets with extremely over the top prices. I recommend you buy this only if you can find a copy for under $20. I know its out there because I just bought my copy for only $8.50 at a Book and Movie Exchange this past Wednesday. Maybe with the upcoming remake, Starz/ Anchor Bay will re-release it at a more affordable rate like they did with Night of the Demons and Hell Night.

This movie is even more frightening than normal when you consider that it is based on a true story.  It shook me quite a bit when I first saw it.  Be warned that some scenes are very sexual in nature and disturbing. It's not gratutious sex like most bad ""horror"" flicks today.  The movie depicts a woman who moves into a new house with her two children and after some time begins to be attacked by an unseen entity.  She is left raped and bruised and thinking she's going out of her mind.  The rape scenes are very tastefully done, but are hard to watch when you think that this supposedly really happened. It is not a movie for children. As an adult, I had to sleep with the lights on after the movie and really had a hard time being alone for a few days.  This is not a blood-letting fest, it's not a teen sex/slasher film, and it's not a dark assylum like setting.  It's a film that is at the top of my list of all time favorite truely scary, ""can't go the bathroom alone"" kind of movies.By the way, if you liked this movie then you should try to get your hands on a made for TV movie called ""Don't be afraid of the Dark"".

All I saw was this woman screaming and being thrown all over the place by an unseen evil. I didn't even know what was going on. Almost 20 years later I rented The Entity to watch it in it's entirety.Barbara Hershey stars as a single mother, with a checkered past, trying to raise her son and two daughters. One night as she's getting ready to go to bed an unseen force throws her across the room and smothers her with a pillow while raping her. She has no idea what has just happened and believes someone must've broken into the house. Upon finding that there was no entry into the house she believes maybe it's some sort of demon. At first she's hesitant to seek psychiatric help but after a second attack in her car she believes she has no alternative. She begins seeing a psychiatrist (Ron Silver).  He tries to help by having her go into great detail about her past, telling her that these attacks are all in her mind. However, the more details she drudges up, the more frequent and violent the attacks become.The movie is over 2 hours long so I could talk about the story forever. The Entity is powerful, mysterious and intense right up until the ending, which I thought was frustrating and a disappointment. I also thought that the music was perfect in this movie especially during the attack scenes. It is a highly intensive flick, it's definitely NOT for younger viewers.

But I watched the movie because it was indeed entertaining and if anything, it made you think and challenged the mind. But the more I watched it, the more disturbing it got. There are parts of the movie where you can see invisible hands fondling her breasts and her being physically attacked by an unknown ""thing"".After watching the movie, I did a lot of online research to find out how true the movie was... and come to find out, the real woman's name was Carlotta Moran in Culver City, CA (which isn't too far from me) and it made news all over the place. There are documented facts from scientists, parapsychologists, and several neutral bystanders who have witnessed various one of the apparitions that attacked her.The only part of the movie that wasn't really ""real"" was the ending where they capture the ghost. In the end, the entity was never truly captured and the real woman had to move five different times and it still followed her. She was raped 15 times during a 10-week DOCUMENTED investigation. The good news is that the entity eventually stopped following her after two years of a terrible ordeal and she would move further and further away from her home.Here's something interesting:In real life, the lady was being raped while screaming in her bedroom. Her 16-year-old son walked in and saw his mother being assaulted on the bed and tried to stop the ghost. He ended up being thrown across the room and broke his arm. When the scene was recreated in the movie, the ACTOR broke the VERY same arm doing that very same scene re-enacted. That's eerie.The movie, as a whole... is not a horror movie.

This is an excellent and very underrated terror movie that can easily make ""Poltergeist"" (released this same year 1982) look like a fairy tale. This story of a young and attractive woman, regularly sexually attacked by an invisible 'entity' is so believable, so realistic that we can't be nothing else but terrified, really chilled, from the beginning to the ending.There is not any failed element in this movie, everything is perfect, from the special effects by Joe Lombardi and Stan Winston to the directing and self-adaptation, through the performance of always excellent Barbara Hershey - who won the Prize as Best Actress in Avoriaz Film Festival, in 1983 - in one of her best roles, and also Ron Silver's, perfect as the stubborn shrink. The chilling soundtrack is also ideal. But the movie is also remarkable because (and on the contrary of ""Poltergeist""), it never tells us about the nature of this entity, we never know if it's a ghost, or a demon, or something else, even not a poltergeist... In the end the entity is neutralized, with liquid helium, but manages to escape and the film leaves us, filled up with questions with no response, exciting our imagination. This makes ""The Entity"" much more interesting to most of the poor, too predictible horror movies we can see today.Another question with no response: where's the DVD?

The attacks on Carla Moran (the excellent Barbara Hershey) are too sudden, violent, and shocking to be played for salaciousness. There's much that's left teasingly ambiguous about why the poltergeist attacks her, and the psychologist (Ron Silver) who examines her wants to tie things too quickly and neatly to her history of childhood abuse and failed relationships. But the film repeatedly gives us epistemological proof of Carla's attacks (we see them as they happen), so it's like Edmund Wilson's famous critical optic for the Turn of the Screw"" exactly in reverse: we KNOW the ghosts are real, and the critics who think otherwise (i.e. Silver and his psychiatrist mentor, whom we come to learn is ethically corrupt) are exactly wrong. Indeed, the psychiatric board who examine Carla seem to wish her almost as much ill as the spirit attacking her. Like all the better horror stories, the ghost is here a figuration for something else menacing its culture; here (as so often) it's about the problems a independent sexually active woman poses to her male-dominated culture, and vice-versa. The confusions of the ghost with Carla's lover (Alex Rocco), her nearly adult son, and her psychiatrist occur too repeatedly and frequently to be mere coincidence.

226947,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,6300247651,John's Horror Corner,"[1, 1]","I'll say two things that I never thought I'd say together: this is a movie about an invisible rapist and I thought it was good.Based on the true story of what is considered the most extraordinary case in parapsychological history.Our first impression is that Carla (Barbara Hershey) is a beautiful, strong, single mother wrapping up a perfectly normal day when she is beaten and raped by an invisible assailant.  However, after this traumatic event, she is rendered an understandably fragile and terrified wreck.With the advent of a second ""event"" of sorts, she's scaring her children and appearing insane to her teenage son, who doesn't understand what's going on...but, really, neither does Carla.  She confides in her supportive friend who advises she see a psychiatrist and even stays with her to help her feel safe.That's not good enough, though.  The ""entity"" strikes when she's in the car, causing her to crash, she finally sees Dr. Sneiderman (Ron Silver), who doesn't seem to find Carla's claims credible but works hard to help her get to the bottom of it.Eventually her teenager witnesses such an assault and is thrown across the room and held at bay by the entity--making a believer out of him.  As things escalate, a team of university parapsychologists get involved much to Dr. Sneiderman's disapproval.  As Sneiderman's disapproval mounts, Carla regains her confidence and mental fortitude.  This is designed, and designed well, to force us to question whether Sneiderman is actually an antagonist or protagonist in this story.So the question remains:  is she nuts and the victim of her own psychological projections, or is she actually being raped by an entity of something other than her own creation?This movie has several faux rape scenes.  They may be intense for more sensitive viewers, but they're tastefully approached--as ""tasteful"" as a rape scene can be--in the capacity that you don't see an assailant during these scenes.There wasn't much in the way of special effects.  They were poor light show displays like crackling electricity.  Except they did a great job of showing that she was being fondled by something invisible.A movie about ghost rape...and it was good.

But this is no ordinary case of rape, the assailant was not a human being but rather an invisible and powerful demonic force that has, for whatever reason, targeted her.The attacks continue in both frequency and ferocity until she involves a team of paranormal investigators to help rid her and her home of this unholy spirit before it escalates any further.

After repeated similar attacks (one while she's driving!), Hershey seeks help from para-psychologists. Having Tobe Hooper's more mainstream and slick ""Poltergeist"" come out on this movie's heels certainly wasn't good for its legacy, and promoting the film as a true story didn't wash with skeptics, but having an actress of Hershey's caliber at the film's center was a superlative move; her presence alone makes the film absorbing and provocative. Appearing like a grown-up flower child, with a likably tossled hairdo and lifestyle, Hershey slips right into these outlandish goings-on with nonchalant ease.

I watched it along with the original Poltergeist and I still enjoyed both even though I saw them over 20 years ago. The Entity is not as tame as other films in this subgenre such as Poltergeist or Paranormal Activity because it is about a demon who repeatedly rapes a woman. She seeks help from doctors and paranormal investigators. In 2009, director Martin Scorsese placed Sidney J. Furie's The Entity (1982) on his list of the 11 Scariest Horror Films of All Time. It placed #4 on the list, above Kubrick's The Shining (1980) and Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). While the ideas explored in the film, such as trying to trap the demon in liquid helium, seem cliche now this film does manage to hold its power. It is based on a true story and the film was adapted from a book about the ordeal. The movie does hold your interest and it is well-acted. I like the techno music when the demon shows up but must admit it is overpowering and probably not to everyone's taste. Overall, the picture and audio quality are fairly average.

The mingling of science and horror rarely works, except the Lovecraft flicks and a few others.  The students that came to her house were such dopey flops I couldn't stand it.  That old guy she was sleeping with could've been her grandfather.  What a joke, man.  The attack and rape scenes were pretty physical, brutal and believable, though.  Gotta admit that.  The blue lightning ruined any authenticity, and the freezing of the creature in the end was just lame.  Her friends were kind of stooges, too.  The 2 stars are for the scenes when she was getting attacked and the one where she was violated while she slept.  By the way, who sleeps through sex?

Later on however the terror begins as Carla is violently raped in her bedroom not by a human but a male evil spirit. In one horrifying scene she is being raped in front of her family, when her teenage son tries to help her he is thrown across the room and shocked by what looks like lightening shocking his body and buzzes like a short circuiting electrical outlet done to him by something unseen.A psychologist anylizes her and at first thinks that a mental disorder is causing hellucinations until she shows up with bruises one in the shape of a hand that she in no way could do to herself, and various bruises on her thighs and body. Carla is in a book store and hears two parasychologists talking about what are signs of haunting are. She tells them she has all of the signs they mentioned, they go to her house to investigate and low and behold they experience them and whole lot more. They set up equipment recording the events, and as they say all hell breaks loose and the war is on.

226984,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6300247651,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 3]","The Entity (Sidney J. Furie, 1981)The Entity is not Sidney J. Furie's best-known film. It's not even his best. It hasn't shown up on any critical thousand-best lists (as has The Ipcress File), nor was it nominated for a veritable slew of Oscars (as was Lady Sings the Blues). But for all that, I'll tell you something--in The Entity, Furie did something that it seems directors have forgotten how to do in the ensuing thirty years; he gave us a horror film that is entirely humorless. And I don't mean that in a bad way. Horror film directors have been leavening horror with humor as long as horror films have been around, on the theory that horror hits you that much harder when you were just laughing. I subscribed to it, too, but The Entity, which I watched last night for the first time in about twenty-five years, is hard evidence that starting off scary and staying there can be just as effective.It takes this movie about five minutes to kick in. We first see a bit of the daily life of Carla Moran (Looking for Mr. Goodbar's Barbara Hershey), a quick montage of her job and the night class she takes to learn to type. Then she goes home...and is attacked by something we can't see. She is raped, though the camera, the first time, is artfully-placed enough that we don't know this until she confides it to her friend Cindy (The Italian Job's Margaret Blye) a couple of days later. The attacks continue, and she notifies the authorities despite knowing how crazy she'll sound. This brings her into contact with two conflicting groups. One is the skeptical medical doctors, the most visible face of which is Phil Sneiderman (the late Ron Silver), a Freudian psychiatrist who believes it's all in her head. The other is headed by Dr. Cooley (The Naked Gun 2 's Jacqueline Brookes), top dog in the same university's nascent department of parapsychology, who believe there's an actual evil entity stalking her. Meanwhile, the attacks continue, each one increasing in brutality (and each more graphically-depicted).According to Frank de Felitta, who wrote both the screenplay and the novel upon which it is based, The Entity is a ""fictionalized account of a true story"". I think we've all heard that enough to know that it means there's a kernel of truth somewhere hidden way down in a mass of fiction, but hearing it still kind of sets your teeth on edge. This is a movie where every last detail is designed to make the viewer as uncomfortable as possible. Pretty impressive for a guy who doesn't often direct horror films (he did a couple in the early sixties, and then this one; his output since has been almost entirely comedies and thrillers). Not just the attacks themselves, but everything. Her kids. Sneiderman's absolute obsession with sex (which turns even creepier when he falls for her, which is inevitable). Cindy's husband, whose boorishness always seems as if it's going to explode into violence. Even the color schemes of some of the sets are just off enough to keep you on edge. The movie does have a few drawbacks (most notably its running length, which modern audiences used to Miramax's ""ninety minutes tops"" horror films will find well-nigh unbearable) and it looks and sounds dated, but it is still an effective, chilling horror film that deserves to be rediscovered. *** ",4,Thirty years later: still scary.,1294963200,"01 14, 2011",2011,3296,"['Entity', 'Sidney', 'J.', 'Furie', '1981', 'Entity', 'not', 'Sidney', 'J.', 'Furie', 'best-known', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'best', ""n't"", 'shown', 'up', 'critical', 'thousand-best', 'lists', 'Ipcress', 'File', 'was', 'nominated', 'veritable', 'slew', 'Oscars', 'was', 'Lady', 'Sings', 'Blues', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'something', 'Entity', 'Furie', 'did', 'something', 'directors', 'have', 'forgotten', 'how', 'do', 'ensuing', 'thirty', 'years', 'gave', 'horror', 'film', 'entirely', 'humorless', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'bad', 'way', 'Horror', 'film', 'directors', 'have', 'been', 'leavening', 'horror', 'humor', 'as', 'long', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'around', 'theory', 'hits', 'much', 'harder', 'when', 'were', 'just', 'laughing', 'subscribed', 'too', 'Entity', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'first', 'time', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'hard', 'evidence', 'starting', 'off', 'scary', 'staying', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'effective.It', 'movie', 'five', 'minutes', 'kick', 'first', 'see', 'bit', 'daily', 'life', 'Carla', 'Moran', 'Looking', 'Mr.', 'Goodbar', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'quick', 'montage', 'job', 'night', 'class', 'learn', 'type', 'Then', 'home', 'attacked', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'raped', 'camera', 'first', 'time', 'artfully-placed', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'friend', 'Cindy', 'Italian', 'Job', 'Margaret', 'Blye', 'couple', 'days', 'later', 'attacks', 'continue', 'authorities', 'knowing', 'how', 'crazy', ""'ll"", 'sound', 'contact', 'two', 'conflicting', 'groups', 'One', 'skeptical', 'medical', 'doctors', 'most', 'visible', 'face', 'Phil', 'Sneiderman', 'late', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'Freudian', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'head', 'other', 'headed', 'Dr.', 'Cooley', 'Naked', 'Gun', '2', 'Jacqueline', 'Brookes', 'top', 'dog', 'same', 'university', 'nascent', 'department', 'parapsychology', 'who', 'believe', 'actual', 'evil', 'entity', 'stalking', 'Meanwhile', 'attacks', 'continue', 'one', 'increasing', 'brutality', 'more', 'graphically-depicted', '.According', 'Frank', 'de', 'Felitta', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'novel', 'based', 'Entity', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'true', 'story', 'think', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'enough', 'know', 'kernel', 'truth', 'somewhere', 'hidden', 'way', 'down', 'mass', 'fiction', 'hearing', 'still', 'kind', 'sets', 'teeth', 'edge', 'movie', 'where', 'last', 'detail', 'designed', 'make', 'viewer', 'as', 'uncomfortable', 'possible', 'Pretty', 'impressive', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'often', 'direct', 'horror', 'films', 'did', 'couple', 'early', 'sixties', 'then', 'one', 'output', 'been', 'almost', 'entirely', 'comedies', 'thrillers', 'Not', 'just', 'attacks', 'everything', 'kids', 'Sneiderman', 'absolute', 'obsession', 'sex', 'even', 'creepier', 'when', 'inevitable', 'Cindy', 'husband', 'boorishness', 'always', 'going', 'explode', 'violence', 'Even', 'color', 'schemes', 'sets', 'are', 'just', 'off', 'enough', 'keep', 'edge', 'movie', 'have', 'few', 'drawbacks', 'most', 'notably', 'running', 'length', 'modern', 'audiences', 'used', 'Miramax', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'tops', 'horror', 'films', 'will', 'find', 'well-nigh', 'unbearable', 'dated', 'still', 'effective', 'chilling', 'horror', 'film', 'be', 'rediscovered', '***']",The Entity VHS
226985,A1ZVK60H60QW9V,6300247651,"Robert Hope ""Rob""","[2, 2]","I have been watching horror films since I was six years old and am a huge fan of the genre having watched thousands ranging from rare horror to mainstream, out of all the horror movies I have viewed only a few have left me with an extremely creepy uneasy feeling afterwards, The Entity happens to be one of them. Surprisingly I just discovered this film a few years ago and it has quickly become one of my number one recommendations to people looking for a &#34;scary&#34; movie.The story is terrifying, especially if you are able to Immerse yourself in the story without constant distractions, I suggest watching the film in total darkness with a good sound system or headphones even better, turn your phone off and don't constantly step away from the movie if you want to get as immersed as possible! The soundtrack will certainly make your heart race during certain scenes! As I mentioned earlier, the story left me with a strange uneasy feeling for a couple days after watching the movie for the first time and I haven't had that type of feeling from a horror film since I was a kid! You truly feel the hopelessness and terror of the lead character, Carla. I would find myself drifting off thinking about the film days after watching it with that same uneasy feeling!I also found the &#34;scientific&#34; element of the Parapsychology team interesting, and then we also have the late and great Mr. Ron Silver in one of his earlier film roles, he does a great job as usual.I see people bashing the effects or saying the movie is &#34;dated&#34;, In my opinion the effects help add to the realism of the movie. As far as being dated, the movie was made in the early 80's, but looks very good even compared to many modern films! The look, feel and style help set the mood if you will allow it without trying to act &#34;hip&#34; by criticizing anything not new or flooded with CGI...compare the effects of A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 to the 2010 remake and you'll likely see what I mean, CGI sometimes has a strange subconscious effect of making it feel too fake in my opinion briefly bringing me out of the immersion.So, if you will allow yourself the opportunity to step inside this movie I am fairly confident you will walk away with a feeling of dread. As mentioned earlier, don't watch it for the first time during the day or with distractions, to get the most out of The Entity watch it preferably alone with a good sound system or headphones(awesome for blocking out distracting noises and will let you is ten at a higher volume without waking anyone else), late at night with no lights on, no phone, iPad or laptop to distract you and don't keep pausing the movie...I promise, you won't regret it, if I could get as unnerved from it with how hardened I am from literally watching Horror for over 30 years, I'm sure you can if you will do as I suggested.I have the movie in DVD and Blu Ray, buy the DVD...the Blu Ray has NO Special Features, not even a menu which is just ridiculous, the picture and sound upgrade isn't good enough to justify the higher cost OR the lack of a menu or any features.Stay Scared,!",5,Terrifying to put it mildly!,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,3121,"['have', 'been', 'watching', 'horror', 'films', 'was', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'genre', 'having', 'watched', 'thousands', 'ranging', 'rare', 'horror', 'mainstream', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'viewed', 'only', 'few', 'have', 'left', 'extremely', 'creepy', 'uneasy', 'feeling', 'afterwards', 'Entity', 'be', 'one', 'Surprisingly', 'just', 'discovered', 'film', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'quickly', 'become', 'one', 'number', 'one', 'recommendations', 'people', 'looking', '34', 'scary', '34', 'movie.The', 'story', 'terrifying', 'especially', 'are', 'able', 'Immerse', 'story', 'constant', 'distractions', 'suggest', 'watching', 'film', 'total', 'darkness', 'good', 'sound', 'system', 'headphones', 'even', 'better', 'turn', 'phone', 'do', ""n't"", 'constantly', 'step', 'away', 'movie', 'want', 'get', 'as', 'immersed', 'possible', 'soundtrack', 'will', 'certainly', 'make', 'heart', 'race', 'certain', 'scenes', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'story', 'left', 'strange', 'uneasy', 'feeling', 'couple', 'days', 'watching', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'type', 'feeling', 'horror', 'film', 'was', 'kid', 'truly', 'feel', 'hopelessness', 'terror', 'lead', 'character', 'Carla', 'would', 'find', 'drifting', 'off', 'thinking', 'film', 'days', 'watching', 'same', 'uneasy', 'feeling', 'also', 'found', '34', 'scientific', '34', 'element', 'Parapsychology', 'team', 'interesting', 'then', 'also', 'have', 'late', 'great', 'Mr.', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'one', 'earlier', 'film', 'roles', 'great', 'job', 'usual.I', 'see', 'people', 'bashing', 'effects', 'saying', 'movie', '34', 'dated', '34', 'opinion', 'effects', 'help', 'add', 'realism', 'movie', 'As', 'far', 'being', 'dated', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'early', '80', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'compared', 'many', 'modern', 'films', 'look', 'feel', 'style', 'help', 'set', 'mood', 'will', 'allow', 'trying', 'act', '34', 'hip', '34', 'criticizing', 'anything', 'not', 'new', 'flooded', 'CGI', 'compare', 'effects', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', '1984', '2010', 'remake', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'CGI', 'sometimes', 'strange', 'subconscious', 'effect', 'making', 'feel', 'too', 'fake', 'opinion', 'briefly', 'bringing', 'immersion.So', 'will', 'allow', 'opportunity', 'step', 'inside', 'movie', 'am', 'fairly', 'confident', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'dread', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'first', 'time', 'day', 'distractions', 'get', 'most', 'Entity', 'watch', 'preferably', 'alone', 'good', 'sound', 'system', 'headphones', 'awesome', 'blocking', 'out', 'distracting', 'noises', 'will', 'let', 'ten', 'higher', 'volume', 'waking', 'anyone', 'else', 'late', 'night', 'lights', 'phone', 'iPad', 'laptop', 'distract', 'do', ""n't"", 'keep', 'pausing', 'movie', 'promise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'could', 'get', 'unnerved', 'how', 'hardened', 'am', 'literally', 'watching', 'Horror', '30', 'years', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'will', 'do', 'suggested.I', 'have', 'movie', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'NO', 'Special', 'Features', 'not', 'even', 'menu', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'picture', 'sound', 'upgrade', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'justify', 'higher', 'cost', 'lack', 'menu', 'features.Stay', 'Scared']",The Entity VHS

And a powerful story it is indeed. Of course, as most who have seen this film know, it is supposedly based on actual, true events. This may or may not be but, a powerful story none-the-less. And another reason I wanted to hunt this film down again is because of the one and only Barbara Hershey. As Carla Moran in the film, she gives it her all. Miss Hershey could easily have been nominated for Best Actress Award, in my opinion. That probably wouldn't happen though mainly because, the subject matter is considered a bit obscure or unbelievable and as such, the film as a whole would not be taken seriously. But whether you believe this to be a true story or not, the film does deliver on all counts (aside from the somewhat weakened ending, which is where the film does lose steam). And as for Miss Hershey, who will forever remain one of the most under-rated actresses, yet one of my lifelong favorites, no one, in my opinion, could have done a better job as Carla Moran than she did. As always, I tip my hat to Barbara Hershey.",5,Barbara Hershey Is Hard To Top Here ...,1328486400,"02 6, 2012",2012,1594,"['remember', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'released', '1981', 'Actually', 'more', 'accurately', 'never', 'forgot', 'years', 'stayed', 'back', 'mind', 'one', 'point', 'wanted', 'locate', 'again', 'DVD', 'instead', 'old', 'VHS', 'format', 'first', 'had', 'most', 'part', 'could', 'seem', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'was', 'nearly', 'was', 'print', 'difficult', 'locate', 'did', 'finally', 'locate', 'again', 'purchase', 'right', 'here', 'amazon.com.And', 'lot', 'reason', 'decided', 'hunt', 'movie', 'down', 'again', 'was', 'powerful', 'story', 'remember', 'being', 'powerful', 'story', 'indeed', 'course', 'most', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'know', 'supposedly', 'based', 'actual', 'true', 'events', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'powerful', 'story', 'none-the-less', 'reason', 'wanted', 'hunt', 'film', 'down', 'again', 'one', 'only', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'Carla', 'Moran', 'film', 'Miss', 'Hershey', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Award', 'opinion', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'happen', 'mainly', 'subject', 'matter', 'considered', 'bit', 'obscure', 'unbelievable', 'such', 'film', 'whole', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'believe', 'be', 'true', 'story', 'not', 'film', 'deliver', 'counts', 'aside', 'somewhat', 'weakened', 'ending', 'where', 'film', 'lose', 'steam', 'Miss', 'Hershey', 'who', 'will', 'forever', 'remain', 'one', 'most', 'under-rated', 'actresses', 'yet', 'one', 'lifelong', 'favorites', 'one', 'opinion', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'Carla', 'Moran', 'did', 'always', 'tip', 'hat', 'Barbara', 'Hershey']",The Entity VHS

Hershey portrays a  victimized woman in an unimaginable situation with grace and passion.  I  would also add &quot;dignity&quot; but since she is forced to get naked  every five minutes it really doesn't apply here.  She's a classy actress  who deserved a good bit better than what she got in this screenplay.  Its  interesting how powerful the Entity is made to be, yet we are led  squeamishly but completely through the harrowing torture and repeated rape  of Hershey's character because she radiates more power than anyone else.  Its Hershey's convincing performance that makes this a level above what  could have ended up as a really schlocky horror film. Some of the scenes  are really quite harrowing and effective.  With less repetition and  gratuitous nudity (wow, am I really saying that ?) the movie's dramatic and  horrific impact would be a lot greater.",3,Ghost Porn?,965260800,"08 3, 2000",2000,996,"['Good', 'rentable', 'flick', 'lots', 'nudity', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'ghost', 'copping-a-feel', 'special', 'effects', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Hershey', 'victimized', 'woman', 'unimaginable', 'situation', 'grace', 'passion', 'would', 'also', 'add', 'quot', 'dignity', 'quot', 'forced', 'get', 'naked', 'five', 'minutes', 'really', ""n't"", 'apply', 'here', 'classy', 'actress', 'who', 'deserved', 'good', 'bit', 'better', 'what', 'got', 'screenplay', 'interesting', 'how', 'powerful', 'Entity', 'made', 'be', 'are', 'led', 'squeamishly', 'completely', 'harrowing', 'torture', 'repeated', 'rape', 'Hershey', 'character', 'more', 'power', 'anyone', 'else', 'Hershey', 'convincing', 'performance', 'level', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'really', 'schlocky', 'horror', 'film', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'quite', 'harrowing', 'effective', 'less', 'repetition', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'wow', 'am', 'really', 'saying', 'movie', 'dramatic', 'horrific', 'impact', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'greater']",The Entity VHS
