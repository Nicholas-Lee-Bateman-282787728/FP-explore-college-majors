1061462,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000NVT0UM,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[18, 19]","In the second season of the guilty pleasure ""Dante's Cove"" (think of it as a cross between ""The O.C."" and the old series ""Dark Shadows"", but with gay erotic content that makes ""Queer As Folk"" look like an afterschool special), the hunky boys and beautiful girls who live at Dante's Hotel are living and loving, while still having to deal with the problems caused by its previous inhabitant, exiled warlock Ambrosius, and his ex-girlfriend and eternal nemesis, the witch Grace.This season, they're joined by a mysterious, more powerful witch, Diana (played by Thea Gil, previously of QAF).  As we rejoin the gang, somewhat naive Kevin is tired of living under Toby's shadow, wants to get a job and become more self-sufficient, which makes Toby insecure about their relationship.  Seeing this as a chance to get Kevin back into his clutches, Ambrosius updates his image (""Call me 'Bro!"") and tries to dazzle the young man with a fast car and to-die-for beach house.  Toby's ex Adam (recast this year, for the better) gets involved with Ambrosius as well, and gets hooked on a local drug with supernatural origins.  Meanwhile, Van gets further into dabbling in magic, with a book she found on the beach, learns the truth about Ambrosius and Grace, and takes desperate measures when her girlfriend Michelle says she has to choose between the magic or their relationship.  The five (apx.) hour-long episodes also reveal a former boyfriend of Kevin's visiting the hotel, Adam's involvement with a gay afterhours sex club, the resort's handyman trying to seduce boss man Marco, more background on the two child ghosts that appear to Toby, as well as much more detail on the ins and outs of Grace's and Ambrosius' powers, and how they must ally themselves with a hotel guest in order to battle it out by the upcoming Solstice.  Comic relief is provided by the appearance of an old porcelin doll, which has a spell causing anyone who touches it to fall in instant lust with the next person (male or female) they see.Critics say ""This is nothing more than a gay soap"" and point at the often over-the-top dialogue and occasional overacting.  Hey, it is what it is, and it works on that level exceedingly well, as most ""guilty pleasures"" should!  They definitely cranked up the ""camp"" quotient a notch or two this year, with Tracy Scoggins as Grace (trying to teach young protege' Van the nuances of black magic) losing her cool and occasionally seeming to be channeling Agnes Moorehead in ""Bewitched""!  The photography, music and eye candy is outstanding, and I found myself powerless to avoid going through all five episodes in one sitting.Note that the format of this 2-DVD set can be a bit confusing, in that there is a top menu to choose the episode you want to see (which should obviously be viewed in order), and then a submenu to play that episode (No option to view all episodes on the disk consecutively.)  The second disk also includes some excellent extras, including deleted scenes, interviews with the cast, ""backlot"" featurette and ""coming out"" stories by the three openly-gay cast members.  It isn't Emmy-worthy, but a fun diversion for you and open-minded friends.  I'm under a spell not to give it anything less than a full five stars out of five.",5,"Campy, sexy and fun!",1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,3253,"['second', 'season', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Dante', 'Cove', 'think', 'cross', 'O.C', 'old', 'series', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'gay', 'erotic', 'content', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'look', 'afterschool', 'special', 'hunky', 'boys', 'beautiful', 'girls', 'who', 'live', 'Dante', 'Hotel', 'are', 'living', 'loving', 'still', 'having', 'deal', 'problems', 'caused', 'previous', 'inhabitant', 'exiled', 'warlock', 'Ambrosius', 'ex-girlfriend', 'eternal', 'nemesis', 'witch', 'Grace.This', 'season', ""'re"", 'joined', 'mysterious', 'more', 'powerful', 'witch', 'Diana', 'played', 'Thea', 'Gil', 'previously', 'QAF', 'rejoin', 'gang', 'somewhat', 'naive', 'Kevin', 'tired', 'living', 'Toby', 'shadow', 'get', 'job', 'become', 'more', 'self-sufficient', 'Toby', 'insecure', 'relationship', 'Seeing', 'chance', 'get', 'Kevin', 'back', 'clutches', 'Ambrosius', 'image', 'Call', 'dazzle', 'young', 'man', 'fast', 'car', 'to-die-for', 'beach', 'house', 'Toby', 'ex', 'Adam', 'recast', 'year', 'better', 'involved', 'Ambrosius', 'as', 'well', 'hooked', 'local', 'drug', 'supernatural', 'origins', 'Meanwhile', 'Van', 'further', 'dabbling', 'magic', 'book', 'found', 'beach', 'truth', 'Ambrosius', 'Grace', 'desperate', 'measures', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'Michelle', 'choose', 'magic', 'relationship', 'five', 'apx', 'hour-long', 'episodes', 'also', 'reveal', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'Kevin', 'visiting', 'hotel', 'Adam', 'involvement', 'gay', 'sex', 'club', 'resort', 'handyman', 'trying', 'seduce', 'boss', 'man', 'Marco', 'more', 'background', 'two', 'child', 'ghosts', 'appear', 'Toby', 'as', 'well', 'much', 'more', 'detail', 'ins', 'outs', 'Grace', 'Ambrosius', 'powers', 'how', 'must', 'ally', 'hotel', 'guest', 'order', 'battle', 'out', 'upcoming', 'Solstice', 'Comic', 'relief', 'provided', 'appearance', 'old', 'porcelin', 'doll', 'spell', 'causing', 'anyone', 'who', 'fall', 'instant', 'lust', 'next', 'person', 'male', 'female', 'see.Critics', 'say', 'nothing', 'more', 'gay', 'soap', 'point', 'often', 'over-the-top', 'dialogue', 'occasional', 'overacting', 'Hey', 'what', 'level', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'most', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'should', 'definitely', 'cranked', 'up', 'camp', 'quotient', 'notch', 'two', 'year', 'Tracy', 'Scoggins', 'Grace', 'trying', 'teach', 'young', 'protege', 'Van', 'nuances', 'black', 'magic', 'losing', 'cool', 'occasionally', 'seeming', 'be', 'channeling', 'Agnes', 'Moorehead', 'Bewitched', 'photography', 'music', 'eye', 'candy', 'outstanding', 'found', 'powerless', 'avoid', 'going', 'five', 'episodes', 'one', 'sitting.Note', 'format', '2-DVD', 'set', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'confusing', 'top', 'menu', 'choose', 'episode', 'want', 'see', 'should', 'obviously', 'be', 'viewed', 'order', 'then', 'submenu', 'play', 'episode', 'option', 'view', 'episodes', 'disk', 'consecutively', 'second', 'disk', 'also', 'excellent', 'extras', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'cast', 'backlot', 'featurette', 'coming', 'out', 'stories', 'three', 'openly-gay', 'cast', 'members', ""n't"", 'Emmy-worthy', 'fun', 'diversion', 'open-minded', 'friends', ""'m"", 'spell', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'less', 'full', 'five', 'stars', 'five']",Dante's Cove: Season 2

The acting, well, it goes over-the-top in classic camp fashion, but it works.  I do agree with one prior reviewer, the sex and drug plot wasn't the greatest, hopefully it gets developed next season, but it did seem an easy way to get Adam out of the closet.  This isn't as raunchy as QAF, but it's also not as developed (hey, about 60 eps verus what, 7 hours tops so far?).  It's a fun show.

1061465,A1DA6E4FNRSAWN,B000NVT0UM,Furio,"[5, 5]","The second short season of Dante's Cove presents us with a better storyline and worse dialogues. Episodes have grown to five and the season is concluded by as high -and lame- a cliffhanger as that at the end of ""season"" one.We have already been introduced to the characters and we find ourselves in the middle of action now, which is always fine with me. Problem is that the script sounds for a good 80% of the time completely idiotic. Short, disjointed sentences are conveying little meaning, no information about the character who speaks them who by the way generally sounds like a complete moron.The setting has been changed too and, while the beaches are just as beautiful, the new hotel Dante is much less impressive than the old one even if it is much larger and allows more room for interaction.Acting is just as plain as it was in season one with the possible exception of Thea Gill and Jon Fleming (this taking the role of Adam) who are up to the not much required by the script.There are several glossy sex scenes, all of them homosexual, most of them involving the male characters. They add nothing to the thrill, to the storyline, to the overall tension and interest if not the pleasing view of the finely groomed bodies of Jon Fleming and some of the others.",2,better and worse,1224547200,"10 21, 2008",2008,1271,"['second', 'short', 'season', 'Dante', 'Cove', 'better', 'storyline', 'worse', 'dialogues', 'Episodes', 'have', 'grown', 'five', 'season', 'concluded', 'as', 'high', '-and', 'lame-', 'cliffhanger', 'end', 'season', 'one.We', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'introduced', 'characters', 'find', 'middle', 'action', 'now', 'always', 'fine', 'Problem', 'script', 'good', '80', '%', 'time', 'completely', 'idiotic', 'Short', 'disjointed', 'sentences', 'are', 'conveying', 'little', 'meaning', 'information', 'character', 'who', 'who', 'way', 'generally', 'complete', 'moron.The', 'setting', 'been', 'changed', 'too', 'beaches', 'are', 'just', 'beautiful', 'new', 'hotel', 'Dante', 'much', 'less', 'impressive', 'old', 'one', 'even', 'much', 'larger', 'more', 'room', 'interaction.Acting', 'just', 'as', 'plain', 'was', 'season', 'one', 'possible', 'exception', 'Thea', 'Gill', 'Jon', 'Fleming', 'taking', 'role', 'Adam', 'who', 'are', 'up', 'not', 'much', 'required', 'script.There', 'are', 'several', 'glossy', 'sex', 'scenes', 'homosexual', 'most', 'involving', 'male', 'characters', 'add', 'nothing', 'thrill', 'storyline', 'overall', 'tension', 'interest', 'not', 'pleasing', 'view', 'finely', 'groomed', 'bodies', 'Jon', 'Fleming', 'others']",Dante's Cove: Season 2

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[6, 6]","In the second season of ""Dante's Cove"" the plot gets better but not enough to make the production much more than a gay soap. Some of the lines will make you groan out loud. My favorite is ""think of it (I don't remember what ""it"" was right now) as a vacation from your brain."" For some reason pretty Kevin gets a lot of the clunker lines. Apparently there isn't a clothing store near Dante's Cove since the men are shirtless (and shortless) a lot of the time. On the other hand, this show was never meant to be a rival for ""Brokeback Mountain.""In season II new characters are added: Kai, Colin, Marco and Diana, the witch good sister of Grace. There is even more naked sex than in the first season; Van becomes a central character; and Toby, the moral center of the series, slips a little.

Finally i gave in and bought season one just based on my friends reviews and others positive reviews. I was not disappointed. Despite the bits of cheesy acting in the beginning and the campiness, the show is REALLY REALLY good. It is DEFINATLY unlike anything you have ever seen. While it does pay an omage to other shows, blending Melrose Place/Dark Shadows and Queer as Folk, it is a great supernatural gay drama that is uniquely it's own.

I actually enjoyed this season a lot more than the first--more episodes, more interesting storylines, more full frontal male nudity (if you're into that sort of thing)! Okay, so the storyline really isn't why most people are watching this show--it's the hot naked bods--both men and women--that keeps us glued to the set.  Admit it, you know it's true.  A bare chest or backside is the normal everyday wardrobe for the inhabitants of Dante's Cove--and we wouldn't have it any other way.  However, without the witches and warlocks and doomed romances and tongue-in-cheek humor, the show would quickly get boring--even with all the sex and nudity.  And most of the beautiful people of the Cove can actually act and seem to be having a ball chewing up the scenery and spitting out the melodramatic dialogue.  Kudos must go to Tracy Scoggins (who I've loved ever since ""The Colbys""), William Gregory Lee (who now gets to be called ""Bro"" on the show--I prefer his full name Ambrosius), Nadine Heimann (who really shines in the second season) and newcomer Thea Gill (formerly of ""Queer as Folk"" and a welcome addition to the show)--they all give excellent performances in addition to looking gorgeous.  And I must mention that the DVD has some nice extra features--deleted scenes with the director's commentary (the director, Sam Irvin, and Charlie David--who plays Toby--also provide interesting commentary on a few of the episodes) and a few featurettes/interviews with the cast.
