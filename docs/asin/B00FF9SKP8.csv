1671480,A38SE24FZUARS7,B00FF9SKP8,Denise Reid,"[0, 4]","This could of been a better movie. The cussing was unnessary. Poetry is a beautiful thing. You don't have to cuss. I think that it says alot about a person who cusses when they want to express themselves. Poetry should be adored by everyone, even children. So stop the cussing and find another way to express yourself. I'm tired of sisters disrespecting themselves and laying up with a man, and you are married to another. If he still lay up with you, he don't care about you, nor does he love you. Wake up people!! With those two things said, that's all I have to say.

This movie dealt with some really serious domestic violence issues that were continuing from generation to generation. Also, this movie didn't wrap everything up like a romance novel where the main characters go off into happily ever after with a marriage and kids, but it was still a very nice ending that the viewer could appreciate because you knew what the leading lady was doing about her situation. In fact, you celebrate with her decisions. The leading man has some trials that he has to overcome and the closing scene hints that it seems to be moving in a positive direction as well.Now I did watch it twice so I dealt with the language. However, it is Rated R, so what takes away from this movie is definitely the number of F bombs and MF bombs thrown around. Yes, I can expect that in the violent or argumentative situations, but........ the writers  definitely went overboard in my opinion.",4,just beautiful,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,1089,"['Beautiful', 'poetry', 'beautiful', 'leading', 'lady', 'leading', 'man', 'beautiful', 'ending', 'just', 'beautiful.I', 'also', 'watched', 'movie', 'twice', 'loved', 'script', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'movie', 'dealt', 'really', 'serious', 'domestic', 'violence', 'issues', 'were', 'continuing', 'generation', 'generation', 'Also', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'wrap', 'everything', 'up', 'romance', 'novel', 'where', 'main', 'characters', 'go', 'off', 'happily', 'ever', 'marriage', 'kids', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'nice', 'ending', 'viewer', 'could', 'appreciate', 'knew', 'what', 'leading', 'lady', 'was', 'doing', 'situation', 'fact', 'celebrate', 'decisions', 'leading', 'man', 'trials', 'overcome', 'closing', 'scene', 'hints', 'be', 'moving', 'positive', 'direction', 'well.Now', 'did', 'watch', 'twice', 'so', 'dealt', 'language', 'However', 'Rated', 'R', 'what', 'away', 'movie', 'definitely', 'number', 'F', 'bombs', 'MF', 'bombs', 'thrown', 'around', 'Yes', 'can', 'expect', 'violent', 'argumentative', 'situations', 'writers', 'definitely', 'went', 'overboard', 'opinion']",Things Never Said Digital
