The 1940s and 1950s produced some of the most visually beautiful movies ever made, and this (along with Picnic) are some of the best examples of it.This movie was made in 1956 by Columbia, after Tyrone left his contract with Fox. So far, only one of his major titles, The Mark of Zorro, has been released. I'd like to see The Rains Came, Blood and Sand, The Black Swan, The Razor's Edge and Captain from Castile on DVD: Fox, enough of these 1950s CinemaScope titles that are in DeLuxe Color, evidently inferior to Technicolor!

(Be warned:  The CD, ""The Eddie Duchin Story"" is NOT the soundtrack to this movie.  On the real soundtrack, Carmen Cavallaro plays the piano - you can find it by doing a search on the Song, ""Dizzy Fingers"").  Then, I ordered this DVD!!  I KNEW I'd want to watch it again and again through the years!  Tyrone Power is GREAT as pianist, Eddie Duchin.  Kim Novak is excellent as his first wife.  I didn't catch who plays his son, but he's wonderful, in spite of his British accent(!)  Filmed on location in NYC in the 1950's, Manhattan is absolutely beautiful.  The story has plenty of teary-eyed moments, but the real star of the show, however, is the MUSIC.  It's unique and delightful music!  When I rented it, I watched it twice, the second time immediately after the first, because I HAD to hear that enchanting music again.  Buy the DVD, then look for the The Soundtrack Album (imported from Japan - I paid 23 dollars for mine, but it is worth every cent)!  If you can't find the CD, there's music a-plenty on the DVD!

308766,A106016KSI0YQ,630236308X,Jay Dickson,"[5, 5]","Even in its day no-one dreamed they'd see much about the actual Eddy Duchin in a movie like this; the point was to see the fabulous lifestyle of the people Eddy played for and wined and dined with, including his wife the society figure Marjorie Oelrichs and his friends the Averell Harrimans (here given a pseudonym since the real Harriman was running for public office at the time) who raised his son Peter. The scale of everything in this very expensive (and very popular) Fox biopic is grand even by Fox standards: every room is the size of an aircraft hangar, and when Marjorie is dying from a mysterious illness after giving birth to her only child with Eddy the actress who plays her, Kim Novak, is made up to look more glamorous and lovely than ever. Very little is done to retain much of a period authenticity for the film--the first shot, supposed set in 1927, shows the Empire State Building proudly looming over Manhattan several years before it was built, and the ugly expensive clothes reflect the midFifties rather than the late Twenties and Thirties. And Tyrone Power looks absolutely nothing like a college kid in his early scenes when Duchin is supposed to have quit college to come to Manhattan to work as a pianist. But to complain about things like that is to miss the point: audiences came to see it because they wanted to swoon over Power making love to Novak, to shudder when Novak keeps predicting her own early death, and to cry when Power reconciles with his estrnaged son and then has to die of leukemia and pass on his legacy to him.Novak is pretty welcome in this film: she's not made up to look her best (as she was in VERTIGO), but her extremely relaxed and gracious presence is always a relief in films like this. But the big pleasure here is in Tyrone Power's performance. He's not nearly so handsome here as he was just a few years before, but this was one of the rare opportunities he got to show he could really act. Even if he's physically unconvincing as an undergraduate he's wonderful in the early scenes at seeming coltish and clumsy, and he mimes Duchin's piano playing (actually performed by Carmen Cavalarro on the soundtrack) aboslutely beautifully. One of the highlighted numbers, an extended sequence where Power as Duchin plays ""Dizzy Fingers"" for his parents and Oelrichs gathered in the crowd at the Central Park Casino, is one of the most lovely musical sequences of the era: it's gorgeously edited, and Power so beautifully mimes Duchin's playing that you feel his pleasure and pride in his own dexterity. Victoria Shaw doesn't add much as Power's second love interest, an English refugee from the Blitz who stays with the re-named Harrimans and gains Peter's confidence when Duchin is away in World War II (creating all kinds of strange Oedipal tensions the film displays but doesn't really acknowledge), but you can mostly ignore her and focus on Power.",3,Swank digs,1208563200,"04 19, 2008",2008,2907,"['Even', 'day', 'no-one', 'dreamed', ""'d"", 'see', 'much', 'actual', 'Eddy', 'Duchin', 'movie', 'point', 'was', 'see', 'fabulous', 'lifestyle', 'people', 'Eddy', 'played', 'wined', 'dined', 'including', 'wife', 'society', 'figure', 'Marjorie', 'Oelrichs', 'friends', 'Averell', 'Harrimans', 'here', 'given', 'pseudonym', 'real', 'Harriman', 'was', 'running', 'public', 'office', 'time', 'who', 'raised', 'son', 'Peter', 'scale', 'everything', 'very', 'expensive', 'very', 'popular', 'Fox', 'biopic', 'grand', 'even', 'Fox', 'standards', 'room', 'size', 'aircraft', 'hangar', 'when', 'Marjorie', 'dying', 'mysterious', 'illness', 'giving', 'birth', 'only', 'child', 'Eddy', 'actress', 'who', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'made', 'up', 'look', 'more', 'glamorous', 'lovely', 'ever', 'Very', 'little', 'done', 'retain', 'much', 'period', 'authenticity', 'film', 'first', 'shot', 'supposed', 'set', '1927', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'proudly', 'looming', 'Manhattan', 'several', 'years', 'was', 'built', 'ugly', 'expensive', 'clothes', 'reflect', 'midFifties', 'rather', 'late', 'Twenties', 'Thirties', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'college', 'kid', 'early', 'scenes', 'when', 'Duchin', 'supposed', 'have', 'quit', 'college', 'come', 'Manhattan', 'work', 'pianist', 'complain', 'things', 'miss', 'point', 'audiences', 'came', 'see', 'wanted', 'swoon', 'over', 'Power', 'making', 'love', 'Novak', 'shudder', 'when', 'Novak', 'predicting', 'own', 'early', 'death', 'cry', 'when', 'Power', 'estrnaged', 'son', 'then', 'die', 'leukemia', 'pass', 'legacy', 'him.Novak', 'pretty', 'welcome', 'film', 'not', 'made', 'up', 'look', 'best', 'was', 'VERTIGO', 'extremely', 'relaxed', 'gracious', 'presence', 'always', 'relief', 'films', 'big', 'pleasure', 'here', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'performance', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'handsome', 'here', 'was', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'was', 'one', 'rare', 'opportunities', 'got', 'show', 'could', 'really', 'act', 'Even', 'physically', 'unconvincing', 'undergraduate', 'wonderful', 'early', 'scenes', 'seeming', 'coltish', 'clumsy', 'Duchin', 'piano', 'playing', 'actually', 'performed', 'Carmen', 'Cavalarro', 'soundtrack', 'aboslutely', 'beautifully', 'One', 'highlighted', 'numbers', 'extended', 'sequence', 'where', 'Power', 'Duchin', 'Dizzy', 'Fingers', 'parents', 'Oelrichs', 'gathered', 'crowd', 'Central', 'Park', 'Casino', 'one', 'most', 'lovely', 'musical', 'sequences', 'era', 'gorgeously', 'edited', 'Power', 'so', 'beautifully', 'Duchin', 'playing', 'feel', 'pleasure', 'pride', 'own', 'dexterity', 'Victoria', 'Shaw', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'Power', 'second', 'love', 'interest', 'English', 'refugee', 'Blitz', 'who', 're-named', 'Harrimans', 'gains', 'Peter', 'confidence', 'when', 'Duchin', 'away', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'creating', 'kinds', 'strange', 'Oedipal', 'tensions', 'film', 'displays', ""n't"", 'really', 'acknowledge', 'can', 'mostly', 'ignore', 'focus', 'Power']",The Eddy Duchin Story VHS

With a little help from Marjorie Oelrichs (Kim Novak), Eddy enchants audiences with his Dizzy Fingers -- eventually winning the heart of Marjorie.

Not so Eddy Duchin. He revolutionized the genre with his unique style of piano playing but remains mostly unknown to this day.The movie based on his life did well at the box office thanks to convincing performances  by Tyrone Power as Duchin, Kim Novak as his first wife Marjorie, and James Whitmore as manager Lou Sherwood. Even the two actors tasked with being only child Peter were vulnerable and likeable.

While others endlessly rewind and replay their childhoods in search of insight, &#34;Peter had the opposite desire,&#34; Hayward says. &#34;He didn't want to know.&#34;These days, the Manhattan-based Duchin is a&#8212;some would say the&#8212;society bandleader par excellence, playing more than 100 gigs a year. But he is equally famous for having led a through-the-looking-glass life marked by tragedy, privilege, politics, Jackie Kennedy Onassis, Kim Novak and thousands of parties. At 59, he has finally written a memoir, Ghost of a Chance. &#34;It was just going to be an anecdotal book about things I saw from the bandstand,&#34; says Duchin. &#34;But I'd been talking to Jackie O, who was a really close personal friend, and she said, 'Look, there's more to talk about because your life is so weird and there's been so much tragedy and pain. If you have the guts, do it.' &#34;The tragedy in Duchin's life began early. His mother, prominent New York socialite Marjorie Oelrichs, died of childbirth complications six days after he was born, in 1937. Duchin himself barely survived. One of his lungs collapsed right after he was born, and he spent months in an oxygen tent. Almost immediately, his father&#8212;the dashing bandleader Eddy Duchin&#8212;turned him over to family friend Averell Harriman, later governor of New York, and his wife, Marie.Duchin says he was always hurt and puzzled by his father's abandonment but now believes that &#34;he must have blamed me to a certain extent for the death of his wife, whom he loved very much.&#34; At the age of 10, he moved in with his father and stepmother Chiquita. That reunion ended when Eddy died of leukemia three years later. Peter eventually went back to the Harrimans. Remarkably, Duchin says, he has no memory of the years with his father. Until he started the book, he didn't seek information about his mother either&#8212;though he had plenty of opportunities. &#34;To think that I often stayed in Newport [R.I.] with people who knew my mother and my mother's family and never asked about her&#8212;that's really weird,&#34; he acknowledges.Before he started on the book, Duchin says the unexamined life suited him just fine. &#34;I don't know if I was scared or what,&#34; he says. &#34;I've never been to shrinks. I never wanted to. It wasn't my style.&#34;His wife&#8212;herself the author of the bestselling memoir Haywire, about her own celebrated and unhappy parents, theatrical producer Leland Hay-ward and actress Margaret Sullavan&#8212;thinks his forgetfulness was a survival mechanism. Even though facing the past was &#34;a risky process,&#34; she thinks that, ultimately, &#34;it will be immensely important to Peter that he did the book, that he had the courage.&#34;At Arden in Woodbury, N.Y., Harriman's 40-bedroom estate on the Hudson River, Duchin learned to hunt, play polo and be a people pleaser. &#34;I tried to be liked and charming so I'd be asked to stay around,&#34; says Duchin. That charm came in handy at Yale, where he studied music, and during one memorable weekend when he romanced Kim Novak, who played his mother in the 1956 movie The Eddy Duchin Story. She was 22; he was 17. &#34;Kim is just a wonderful woman,&#34; says Duchin, when pressed for details.Duchin knew the blue-blooded&#8212;the Whitneys, the Dukes, the Phippses&#8212;and the hot-blooded, most notably Ava Gardner, with whom he had an affair in 1962. &#34;She was a woman who really knew a great deal about all levels of life from the dregs to the top,&#34; he says of the actress.With his first wife, Cheray (the mother of his three children&#8212;Jason, 30, an actor; Courtenay, 28, a graphics designer; and Colin, 26, a potter), he was a frequent guest on Aristotle Onassis's yacht. He describes the Ari-Jackie union as &#34;an extremely intense, close relationship,&#34; adding, &#34;I daresay she loved him very much at one point.&#34;He was much less impressed by Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman, Averell Harriman's third wife (and wife Brooke's stepmother during Pamela's 10-year marriage to Leland Hayward). &#34;I think I write about her honestly,&#34; says Duchin, who portrays the current U.S. ambassador to France as controlling and conniving: &#34;Pamela's focus became Averell and what was good for her and him.&#34; Duchin claims, among other things, that she cheated him out of land that had been promised to him by Harriman. She won't comment on the book.With Ghost of a Chance out of the way, Duchin is back on the road. Between jobs he retreats to his country house in Connecticut, where he gardens and listens to Bach. In those baroque strains, he hears the echo of personal rhythms. Bach, says Duchin, &#34;is highly structured, yet it's immensely free.&#34; As is Duchin. He has faced his music; now he's ready to dance.CURRENTLY...&#62;",5,PERSONAL NOTE & LOT'S OF MEMORABELIA,1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,6519,"['When', 'opened', ""''The"", 'NEW', 'Stork', 'Club',

Henry,"[41, 44]","There is a peculiar irony in the necessity of producing a movie depicting civilized culture during a time when culture was still civilized. It no longer is. The barbarians are no longer at the gates, they occupy the essential seats of power. This sensitive, riveting look at a real-life musician sensation is polished, enjoyable moviemaking at its best. It is the account of a gifted man pursuing The Good Life, only to find that attaining one's dreams/ambitions is only the first layer of real life - a layer that paradoxically must be shed if life's core is to be attained. The protagonist of this epic runs headlong into life's limitations laid on him by God, circumstance and his own limited vision of happiness and love.""The Eddy Duchin Story"" has a universal quality about it in its theme of recognizing, then reconciling oneself to, the &quot;plot&quot; of one's own mysterious life. And like another moving classic, &quot;The Razor's Edge,&quot; Tyrone Power masterfully portrays the hero of an elusive chase for joy and meaning in life, and the discovery that mature happiness lay in wait for us beyond the shattered dreams of our youth. It helps that the protagonist really lived, so that we feel this film goes beyond mere idle artistic speculation. We also feel the intrinsic fascination toward a celebrity of soaring talent who has captured the acclaim of Society in his day.The entertainment value of the film is fully equal to its message. The breathtaking popular music permeating the movie is anything but gratuitous, woven logically and elegantly into the story line. The casting, the beautiful uptown Manhattan setting, and the script are cobbled together well, and the generous length of the film is just right here - we want to spend time watching this plot sort itself out, yet the film never drags.TRANSLATION: kick back for the night with the ones you love - I saw this one when my parents brought me to the theater as a young boy, and I in turn treated my family to it now - get a handkerchief ready at hand, turn out the lights, bring out the popcorn, plug in ""The Eddy Duchin Story"" ... and bring on Entertainment with a capital &quot;E&quot;. Oh yes, and bring out the clich&eacute;, &quot;They don't make 'em like they used to.&quot; In this case, sadly, &quot;they&quot; could not - this film was made shortly before America had lost its culture, and now it's a case of ""all the king's horses...""

His measured weight of fingering ensured a balance between poetry and purpose... Every sound conceivable was possible in his artistic palette... He played wonderful music... His piano tone itself was gorgeous and versatile... He amazed audiences with his immense vigor, virtuosity and daring technique... He was soon a darling of Marjorie and high society...His love affair with Marjorie culminates in marriage... but the perfect happiness is short-lived as Marjorie fades away in child-birth on Christmas Eve...Heartbroken, Duchin declines to accept his baby blaming him for Marjorie's death and turns him over to Marjorie's uncle and aunt to be cared and raised, and embarks an overseas concert tour with his friend & manager, Lou Sherwood (James Whitmore).During World War II, while serving as Naval Lieutenant Commander in the Pacific, Duchin realizes the futility of his attitude about his son, now ten, but his attempts to reconcile with him failed because of the boy's resentment...With the help of Chiquita (Victoria Shaw) Peter's pretty nanny, he finally wins his son over and with his ability to charm as well as to thrill audiences, he proves himself as the pianist of sentiment par excellence... Nothing equaled the lightness & sweetness of his preluding on the piano...But tragedy once again overtakes Duchin's daisy fingers as he learns he is suffering from leukemia and has only a short time to live...Duchin's passing from the scene playing a ""little double piano"" with Peter is a duo-handkerchief climax...Tyrone Power won the hearts of the audience playing the pianist and bandleader Eddy Duchin... He does not interpret music, he exudes it, breathes it, compelling showmanship with great freedom, taste and intelligence...With a stupendous distribution of Duchin's fine piano, the film is predictable, handsome & sentimental...",4,Predictable... handsome... and sentimental...,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,2126,"['help', 'Marjorie', 'Oelrichs', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'charming', 'socialite', 'met', 'New', 'York', 'Central', 'Park', 'Casino', 'Eddy', 'Duchin', 'was', 'part', 'two', 'piano', 'team', 'featured', 'Leo', 'Reisman', 'Larry', 'Keating', 'Orchestra', 'late', ""1920's..Duchin"", 'distinctive', 'playing', 'rapid', 'fame', 'measured', 'weight', 'fingering', 'ensured', 'balance', 'poetry', 'purpose', 'Every', 'sound', 'conceivable', 'was', 'possible', 'artistic', 'palette', 'played', 'wonderful', 'music', 'piano', 'tone', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'versatile', 'amazed', 'audiences', 'immense', 'vigor', 'virtuosity', 'daring', 'technique', 'was', 'soon', 'darling', 'Marjorie', 'high', 'society', 'love', 'affair', 'Marjorie', 'culminates', 'marriage', 'perfect', 'happiness', 'short-lived', 'Marjorie', 'away', 'child-birth', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'Heartbroken', 'Duchin', 'accept', 'baby', 'blaming', 'Marjorie', 'death', 'Marjorie', 'uncle', 'aunt', 'be', 'cared', 'raised', 'overseas', 'concert', 'tour', 'friend', 'manager', 'Lou', 'Sherwood', 'James', 'Whitmore', '.During', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'serving', 'Naval', 'Lieutenant', 'Commander', 'Pacific', 'Duchin', 'futility', 'attitude', 'son', 'now', 'attempts', 'reconcile', 'failed', 'boy', 'resentment', 'help', 'Chiquita', 'Victoria', 'Shaw', 'Peter', 'pretty', 'nanny', 'finally', 'son', 'ability', 'charm', 'as', 'well', 'thrill', 'audiences', 'pianist', 'sentiment', 'par', 'excellence', 'Nothing', 'equaled', 'lightness', 'sweetness', 'preluding', 'piano', 'tragedy', 'once', 'again', 'overtakes', 'Duchin', 'daisy', 'fingers', 'suffering', 'leukemia', 'only', 'short', 'time', 'live', 'Duchin', 'passing', 'scene', 'playing', 'little', 'double', 'piano', 'Peter', 'duo-handkerchief', 'climax', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'won', 'hearts', 'audience', 'playing', 'pianist', 'bandleader', 'Eddy', 'Duchin', 'not', 'interpret', 'music', 'compelling', 'showmanship', 'great', 'freedom', 'taste', 'intelligence', 'stupendous', 'distribution', 'Duchin', 'fine', 'piano', 'film', 'predictable', 'handsome', 'sentimental']",The Eddy Duchin Story VHS
