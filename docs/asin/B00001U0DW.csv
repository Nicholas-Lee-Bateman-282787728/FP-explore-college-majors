While one's interest is piqued by the blurb that touts the film as """"the funniest Australian film ever made,"" it sounded like the usual publicist's hype.  Wrong.  This *is* the funniest Australian film ever made and if you want to drop the ""Australian"" qualifier, I don't think the reviewers on this page would protest much.I will say that Qantas features the Australian version of the film.  Judging by what others had said on these pages, if the geniuses at Miramax felt it necessary to dub lines for the US release so we thick-headed Americans didn't have to put up with the way these foreigners speak English, then they made a colossal blunder.  Just show us the movie.  We can handle it.  This decision was obviously a small part of a failed marketing campaign by Miramax.  Despite blowing out the Australian box office with a gross that exceeded the film's budget by 10x, the US gross (according to Box Office Mojo) was $887K.Luckily, ""The Castle"" has developed a cult following and a signficant post-run shelf-life.  Adam Sandler and Rob Scheider are huge fans, and Roger Ebert includes it in his ""festivals"" of under-appreciated classics.  And, if Qantas keeps it regular rotation, the word is certain to spread even further.Oh, here's another reason to watch: look for an young Eric Bana in a supporting role as new son-in-law Con Petropolous.",5,This one is going straight to the pool room!,1138924800,"02 3, 2006",2006,1447,"['Qantas', 'Airlines', 'Castle', 'regular', 'fare', 'cabin-wide', 'Video', 'Demand', 'service', 'one', 'interest', 'piqued', 'blurb', 'film', 'funniest', 'Australian', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'sounded', 'usual', 'publicist', 'hype', 'Wrong', 'funniest', 'Australian', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'want', 'drop', 'Australian', 'qualifier', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'reviewers', 'page', 'would', 'protest', 'much.I', 'will', 'say', 'Qantas', 'Australian', 'version', 'film', 'Judging', 'what', 'others', 'had', 'said', 'pages', 'geniuses', 'Miramax', 'felt', 'necessary', 'dub', 'lines', 'US', 'release', 'thick-headed', 'Americans', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'put', 'up', 'way', 'foreigners', 'speak', 'English', 'then', 'made', 'colossal', 'blunder', 'Just', 'show', 'movie', 'can', 'handle', 'decision', 'was', 'obviously', 'small', 'part', 'failed', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'Miramax', 'blowing', 'out', 'Australian', 'box', 'office', 'gross', 'exceeded', 'film', 'budget', '10x', 'US', 'gross', 'according', 'Box', 'Office', 'Mojo', 'was', '887K.Luckily', 'Castle', 'developed', 'cult', 'following', 'signficant', 'post-run', 'shelf-life', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Rob', 'Scheider', 'are', 'huge', 'fans', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'festivals', 'under-appreciated', 'classics', 'Qantas', 'regular', 'rotation', 'word', 'certain', 'spread', 'even', 'further.Oh', 'here', 'reason', 'watch', 'look', 'young', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'supporting', 'role', 'new', 'son-in-law', 'Con', 'Petropolous']",N/A
511656,A1RKD1I8MW1LG6,B00001U0DW,BeachReader,"[5, 5]","I really enjoyed this funny, offbeat, and down-to-earth Australian film. Not only was the situation funny, but the depiction of family was really heartwarming and charming.It would have been easy to make fun of the eccentric Kerrigan family, but instead, the writer(s) wrote the script as ""soft"" satire, so that the family members were never the objects of ridicule. We enjoy and care about these characters because they are all so earnest and sincere, and hope that they will eventually overcome.The owner of ""The Castle"" is the always-optimistic Darryl Kerrigan, who regards his home as the best place in the world, despite the nearby airport, the huge power lines overhead, and the toxic landfill underneath. His home is what he and his family have made it - it is not just a physical place, but the repository of all of their years of striving and all of their fond memories.When their continuing tenure in the home is threatened by the airport expansion, the Kerrigans and some neighbors decide to fight back and hire a bumbling, incompetent attorney to handle their appeal.Although this movie is a comedy, it also is a David and Goliath story and one that shows the strength of family and the hopes of the little guys.Well worth watching.

511659,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00001U0DW,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[4, 5]","This was very funny little movie set in Australia about a close knit family and what happens when the wheels are set in motion by powerful forces to take their home away from them.  Darryl Kerrigan and his family live in what most of us would probably call a ramshackle abode next to an airport.  When I said right next to an airport, I mean the runway is practically in their backyard.  The Kerrigan house is one of a four or five small houses built on this less than ideal tract of land, part of a development that never really got off the ground.  All this matters not to the Kerrigans, as it's not just their house, but also their home.The plot centers around a large big business/government consortium taking the land that the Kerrigans' and the other's homes are on for further development of the airport.  This is done by what is called 'compulsory acquisition', or a fancy way of saying someone has the right to force you out of your home and off your land for the common good.  Seemingly fair compensation was offered, but Darryl wants no part of it, as he feels his house is his home, and memories and experiences cannot be bought and sold.  His home is his castle, and so he organizes his neighbors and leads the fight to stop this seemingly unstoppable force.One of the great things about this movie was the optimism of the Kerrigans, especially Darryl.  It was like they had no real concept of the type of opposition they faced, but this helped them in that they saw themselves as equals, deserving equal and fair treatment, while most probably would have been resigned to their fate, deciding that they couldn't fight big business/government.  And it wasn't just their optimism in their legal battles, but in life in general.  Things most people would take for granted or not even recognize, the Kerrigans valued and cherished.  For example, living so close to an airport would certainly be undesirable to most, but to also have power lines in close proximity would scare anyone away.  For the Kerrigans, living close to the airport means they got a real bargain on their house, and also if they ever wanted to take a trip, they could just walk to the airport.  And as far as the power lines, Darryl seems them as a testament to the modern world, a mark of man's achievement.Another wonderful aspect to the movie was the relationships between the Kerrigan family members.  While not always the brightest bulbs in the box, their hearts where always in the right place, and the family ties were strong and solid, based on love, respect and complete acceptance of each other.  No one member seemed more important than the other, and they seemed to exist in virtual harmony.As Darryl and his family struggle with the idea of having to leave their home, Darryl ends up taking his case to the highest court, with a little help from an unlikely source.  Do they get to stay or do they get forced out?  See for yourself, as this is a charming and often hilarious film that demonstrates a man's home is truly his castle, and the lengths some are willing to go to protect the inalienable rights most take for granted.A nice wide screen presentation, there is very little in the way of extras, only a couple of trailers and some movie recommendations.  I would recommend this to just about anyone looking for a funny, sweet, and engaging comedy.",4,Darryl vs Goliath,1074211200,"01 16, 2004",2004,3348,"['was', 'very', 'funny', 'little', 'movie', 'set', 'Australia', 'close', 'knit', 'family', 'what', 'when', 'wheels', 'are', 'set', 'motion', 'powerful', 'forces', 'take', 'home', 'away', 'Darryl', 'Kerrigan', 'family', 'live', 'what', 'most', 'would', 'probably', 'call', 'ramshackle', 'abode', 'airport', 'When', 'said', 'right', 'next', 'airport', 'mean', 'runway', 'practically', 'backyard', 'Kerrigan', 'house', 'one', 'four', 'five', 'small', 'houses', 'built', 'less', 'ideal', 'tract', 'land', 'part', 'development', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'ground', 'matters', 'not', 'Kerrigans', 'not', 'just', 'house', 'also', 'home.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'large', 'big', 'business/government', 'consortium', 'taking', 'land', 'Kerrigans', 'other', 'homes', 'are', 'further', 'development', 'airport', 'done', 'what', 'called', ""'compulsory"", 'acquisition', 'fancy', 'way', 'saying', 'someone', 'right', 'force', 'home', 'land', 'common', 'good', 'Seemingly', 'fair', 'compensation', 'was', 'offered', 'Darryl', 'part', 'house', 'home', 'memories', 'experiences', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'bought', 'sold', 'home', 'castle', 'so', 'neighbors', 'fight', 'stop', 'seemingly', 'unstoppable', 'force.One', 'great', 'things', 'movie', 'was', 'optimism', 'Kerrigans', 'especially', 'Darryl', 'was', 'had', 'real', 'concept', 'type', 'opposition', 'faced', 'helped', 'saw', 'equals', 'deserving', 'equal', 'fair', 'treatment', 'most', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'resigned', 'fate', 'deciding', 'could', ""n't"", 'fight', 'big', 'business/government', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'optimism', 'legal', 'battles', 'life', 'general', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'take', 'granted', 'not', 'even', 'recognize', 'Kerrigans', 'valued', 'cherished', 'example', 'living', 'so', 'close', 'airport', 'would', 'certainly', 'be', 'undesirable', 'most', 'also', 'have', 'power', 'lines', 'close', 'proximity', 'would', 'scare', 'anyone', 'away', 'Kerrigans', 'living', 'close', 'airport', 'got', 'real', 'bargain', 'house', 'also', 'ever', 'wanted', 'take', 'trip', 'could', 'just', 'walk', 'airport', 'as', 'far', 'power', 'lines', 'Darryl', 'testament', 'modern', 'world', 'mark', 'man', 'achievement.Another', 'wonderful', 'aspect', 'movie', 'was', 'relationships', 'Kerrigan', 'family', 'members', 'not', 'always', 'brightest', 'bulbs', 'box', 'hearts', 'where', 'always', 'right', 'place', 'family', 'ties', 'were', 'strong', 'solid', 'based', 'love', 'respect', 'complete', 'acceptance', 'other', 'one', 'member', 'seemed', 'more', 'important', 'other', 'seemed', 'exist', 'virtual', 'harmony.As', 'Darryl', 'family', 'struggle', 'idea', 'having', 'leave', 'home', 'Darryl', 'up', 'taking', 'case', 'highest', 'court', 'little', 'help', 'unlikely', 'source', 'Do', 'get', 'stay', 'do', 'get', 'forced', 'out', 'See', 'charming', 'often', 'hilarious', 'film', 'man', 'home', 'truly', 'castle', 'lengths', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'protect', 'inalienable', 'rights', 'most', 'take', 'granted.A', 'nice', 'wide', 'screen', 'presentation', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'extras', 'only', 'couple', 'trailers', 'movie', 'recommendations', 'would', 'recommend', 'just', 'anyone', 'looking', 'funny', 'sweet', 'engaging', 'comedy']",N/A

511661,AYOPN5ABOAUER,B00001U0DW,DavidRoss,"[0, 0]","Rob Sitch has created a small comic gem in this unpretentious movie about an ordinary man's battle to save his family's home from compulsory annexation by the neighboring airport.  Rife with the broad irreverent humor that practically defines the Aussies' national character (think of Paul Hogan's TV show or CROCODILE DUNDEE, or Baz Luhrmann's STRICTLY BALLROOM), the story manages to stay just one step ahead of farce.  Though we can hardly take the characters seriously, they're good blokes nonetheless and it's easy to identify with their predicament.Darryl Kerrigan (Michael Caton) is a good-natured family man who lives by simple principles.  He values his home &amp; family above all else in life.  When the billion dollar corporation that owns the airport tries to oust him from his home, he just knows it isn't right.  And he's too ignorant to know what he's up against when he decides to fight.  Though chuckles abound throughout the film, real belly laughs are in order when his hapless lawyer (Tiriel Mora) challenges the constitutionality of 'compulsory acquisition' in court.  (His legal argument will doubtless soon become a fixture in law schools throughout the English-speaking world.)In fact, the story offers a solid critique of common law just as incisive and nearly as funny as Jonathan Swift's scathingly satirical critique in Gulliver's Travels.  And it's expressed so plainly and clearly that anyone should be able to understand it--even poor benighted Darryl Kerrigan, whose command of legal jargon may be slight, yet who knows in his heart when he's right.  3 1/2 stars for this feel-good little comedy with its heart in the right place.",4,Typically Broad Aussie Comedy with a Warm Heart,1078704000,"03 8, 2004",2004,1663,"['Rob', 'Sitch', 'created', 'small', 'comic', 'gem', 'unpretentious', 'movie', 'ordinary', 'man', 'battle', 'save', 'family', 'home', 'compulsory', 'annexation', 'neighboring', 'airport', 'Rife', 'broad', 'irreverent', 'humor', 'practically', 'Aussies', 'national', 'character', 'think', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'TV', 'show', 'CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'STRICTLY', 'BALLROOM', 'story', 'stay', 'just', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'farce', 'can', 'hardly', 'take', 'characters', 'seriously', ""'re"", 'good', 'blokes', 'nonetheless', 'easy', 'identify', 'predicament.Darryl', 'Kerrigan', 'Michael', 'Caton', 'good-natured', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'simple', 'principles', 'home', 'amp', 'family', 'else', 'life', 'When', 'billion', 'dollar', 'corporation', 'airport', 'oust', 'home', 'just', ""n't"", 'right', 'too', 'ignorant', 'know', 'what', 'up', 'when', 'fight', 'chuckles', 'abound', 'film', 'real', 'belly', 'laughs', 'are', 'order', 'when', 'hapless', 'lawyer', 'Tiriel', 'Mora', 'constitutionality', ""'compulsory"", 'acquisition', 'court', 'legal', 'argument', 'will', 'doubtless', 'soon', 'become', 'fixture', 'law', 'schools', 'English-speaking', 'world', 'fact', 'story', 'solid', 'critique', 'common', 'law', 'just', 'incisive', 'nearly', 'as', 'funny', 'Jonathan', 'Swift', 'scathingly', 'satirical', 'critique', 'Gulliver', 'Travels', 'expressed', 'so', 'plainly', 'clearly', 'anyone', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'even', 'poor', 'benighted', 'Darryl', 'Kerrigan', 'command', 'legal', 'jargon', 'may', 'be', 'slight', 'yet', 'who', 'heart', 'when', 'right', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'feel-good', 'little', 'comedy', 'heart', 'right', 'place']",N/A

In this rather heartwarming and hilarious film, an eccentric patriarch (Caton) and his somewhat backwater family (including a dorky looking young Eric Bana as a martial arts student son-in-law) do battle with a town council that wants their neighborhood for the land.This crazy clan refuses to sell ... and though it is a total Oscar-worthy comedy, I shuddered with delight when Caton's son chased the corporate leg-breaker off his land with a shotgun (which, as he does with everything, marvels at what a great bargain it was and how much he might be able to get for it).In the end, he befriends a man who turns out to be a retired Queen's Counsel - and is defended by him in a courtroom scene that would be more moving if it weren't so damned funny. If you are hunting for the genuine Australia, if you like slightly older quirky 1990s comedy, like foreign English-speaking movies, or like movies at all, you cannot miss this. It is a film that portrays the warmth, the homey quality, the depth, of genuine, good people: it's the story of us all.Particularly moving is Caton's soliloquys, again, funnier than anything and profoundly moving. He wonders why anyone could want to displace a family, and sums it up with a hilariously innocent, heartfelt exclamation: ""I'm beginning to understand how those aboriginines felt!""

As the other reviews say, much has been changed. Even the music has been replaced, so I've heard (its been years since I saw the original version so I wouldn't have caught that on my own). The Australian feel to it helped make it great. Now they've dubbed over everything with American phrases and names, and have simply cut out a few other things.

The cast is excellent, each character painfully normal, and not a set of folk you would see in the average Hollywood film.Michael Caton is flawless as the simple and proud head of a barely average family who fights to save a mediocre home next to the airport. We groan and snicker as with oblivious earnestness Caton's youngest son gives us a tour of their life, from family visits with his convict brother to their weekends at their vacation property (a trailer next to a swamp). It seems pitiable at first, but as the father's warmth and devotion to his family is demonstrated, and his optimism keeps them afloat, one can't help but develop an appreciation for his particular blend of ignorance and sentimentality.

The casting was very well done and the acting couldn't have been better. The cinematography works wonders for the film and the choreography impressed me, too. The plot moves along at a very good pace and I was never once bored--I was too busy laughing! The musical score enhances the film all the more, too.When the film starts, we quickly meet the Kerrigan family who live in Melbourne, Australia right next to a major airport. The planes may fly directly overhead as they take off and land; but the Kerrigans are blissfully happy anyway and they cherish their home. Darryl Kerrigan (Michael Caton) is the father who has his own small business as a tow truck operator, and his wife Sal (Anne Tenney) always gets compliments on her cooking even when she really didn't do anything more than just make meat loaf! The Kerrigans have children, too. We meet Tracey (Sophie Lee), who marries Con Petropoulous (Eric Bana in his film debut), Dale (Stephen Curry), Wayne (Wayne Hope) who is in prison for armed robbery and Steve (Anthony Simcoe).Their happiness is shattered, however, when they get a letter in the mail that they are being compulsorily evicted; they will get money for their home but they desperately want to stay put. Their neighbors Farouk (Costas Kilias) and the elderly Jack (Monty Maizels) are also being forced out against their will.Darryl's first step is to go to solicitor Dennis Denuot (Tiriel Mora); Dennis tells Darryl that this is not his area of expertise but Darryl relentlessly pushes Dennis to defend him. Dennis is unable to sway the judge and just when all hope seems lost Darryl meets Lawrence Hammill (Charles 'Bud' Tingwell), a retired but caring Queens Council lawyer who takes an interest in the Kerrigans and their neighbors.When they get to Australia's highest court, Darryl and Dennis are sweating bullets and although Lawrence keeps his cool, it seems that whatever he says in defense of Darryl and the others is immediately and brilliantly countered by five lawyers for the huge and impersonal conglomerate that works with the Australian government to do things like forcibly buy people's homes and land for a few extra feet of airport runway. It's not at all clear that Darryl will win his case.The plot can go in different directions from here. What happens when a pretty nasty, threatening looking tough guy arrives at the Kerrigan's doorstep late at night and tells them there will be ""consequences"" for them if they don't immediately leave their home? And, if they do have to leave, what happens to Farouk--and Jack who is too frail to withstand the stress of moving? Lawrence is polished as polished can be; but can he take on and win his case against the five lawyers for the huge, huge company that is in cahoots with the government? No spoilers--watch and find out!I am sorry to read in other people's reviews that there were edits of this film before they released it to American audiences; I hope they can re-release this film on DVD exactly as it was originally made. However, don't let that turn you off and steer you away from this DVD--it's still excellent as it is.

But I will say if you love this movie get the Region 4 version from Australia. Yes you will need a region-free DVD player but it is well worth it. I found one for $35 that I can honestly say is one of the best pieces of electronic equipment I have ever owned. I can watch any movie I want without the powers that be telling me what I can and cannnot watch based on my geography. The previous poster is incorrect. There are scenes that have chopped. Part of one can be seen in the trailer. Nothing was taken out that will muddy the plot. But I have to ask Miramax, why, at a short 90 minutes, would you bother taking out more of the fun? And I truly have a dislike for the voiceovers done to change Aussie references to American. Don't underestimate the viewing audience Miramax! If we are going to watch this movie, most of us will look up any words or phrases we aren't familiar with. Thats part of the fun.There are 2 versions of this film available in Oz. There's the standard version and The Pool Room Edition. It comes complete with a fuzzy slipcover to imitate a pool table, a lovely keep case with pictures of the cast, sheet music to ""We're Goin' To Bonnydoon"", and a top 10 list of the Kerrigans best deals from the trading post.

What probably put me off (to be completely honest) was that it's an Australian film.  And you know what they say about Aussies - they're all outlaw heathen scum, so what could they possibly know about making good movies.  Right?Well knock me over with a didgeridoo mate - Rob Sitch has created a wee beauty of a film.  Despite its Australian heritage, The Castle has bucket loads of charm and is a thoroughly entertaining movie with plenty of laughs and good feeling.After watching so many films in recent years about dysfunctional families (think American Beauty, Ice Strom, The Royal Tennebaums etc) it really is a treat to see such a positive depiction of family life.  The Kerrigan's really are perfectly content with their lot in life.  They might be simple but they do love each other, love their castle, support each other and laugh together.  While others may look down their noses at this working class clan the Kerrigan's don't care (in fact, if the truth be known, they're probably too dumb to notice - as Aussies often are) because they have the greatest gift of all - a nurturing home.  And strewth mate, who could want more than that!A couple of minor quibbles:  although it is funny, the humor is more of the quirky Aussie variety and at times a bit too - well, Australian really.  So while I found myself smiling through most of the movie, I wouldn't call The Castle a screaming comedy.  It's more off-beat and quirky.Also, the final quarter of the film seems a little bit rushed to me.  Things were looking tough for the Kerrigan's there at one stage and then all of a sudden (right out of the blue mate) comes a white knight to save the day.  You beauty!  Yeah, right.  A little bit too easy me thinks.It's not a blockbuster by any stretch of the imagination but at least it knows its limitations.

511685,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00001U0DW,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 35]","&quot;The Castle,&quot; a highly praised Australian farce, is a decidedly minor, lackluster and virtually laughless installment in the recently very popular genre known as the offbeat working class comedy. This vain attempt  to mine the territory exploited so successfully a few years back in  &quot;The Full Monty,&quot; mistakes quirkiness for humor, so much so that  it is not overstating it to say that there is nary a laugh in the film's  entire (and blessedly brief) 84 minute running time.The film hits the  wrong note from the very beginning with its overly cutesy premise: a family  of preposterously upbeat and utterly addled Australians, living a mere  stone's throw away from a major airport, are threatened with eviction from  the hovel they call home to make way for some airport expansion. The  concept of a house situated virtually on a busy runway may strike some  people as the height of hilarity, but it is a joke that grows wearisome  when stretched to the extent of a full length movie. The father inspires  his family on a daily basis with his Pangloss-like view of the best of all  possible worlds, and it is he, when confronted with this uncaring menace  from the outside world, who leads the fight to save his homestead and those  of his neighbors.&quot;The Castle&quot; might have been a very wild,  daring comedy had the writers not settled for a cast of characters so  devoid of basic human intelligence that they emerge as pathetic rural  caricatures towards which the audience can feel patronizingly superior.  This slackjawed quality of mindless innocence on the part of most of the  characters results in a broadness in the comedy that essentially robs it of  any sophistication. Joke after joke simply falls flat, and the constant  repetition of various series of jokes (the father's inane daily awe at the  mundane culinary concoctions of his wife, his obsession with achieving  cutthroat bargains on used items etc.) drains what little humor the comical  concepts carry the first time around.&quot;The Castle&quot; emerges as a  well-intentioned &quot;nice&quot; film, but it commits the gravest sin for  which no comedy can be forgiven - it is simply not funny.",2,"lackluster, laughless comedy",964310400,"07 23, 2000",2000,2197,"['quot', 'Castle', 'quot', 'highly', 'praised', 'Australian', 'farce', 'decidedly', 'minor', 'lackluster', 'virtually', 'laughless', 'installment', 'recently', 'very', 'popular', 'genre', 'known', 'offbeat', 'working', 'class', 'comedy', 'vain', 'attempt', 'mine', 'territory', 'exploited', 'so', 'successfully', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'quot', 'Full', 'Monty', 'quot', 'mistakes', 'quirkiness', 'humor', 'so', 'much', 'not', 'overstating', 'say', 'nary', 'laugh', 'film', 'entire', 'blessedly', 'brief', '84', 'minute', 'running', 'time.The', 'film', 'wrong', 'note', 'very', 'beginning', 'overly', 'cutesy', 'premise', 'family', 'preposterously', 'upbeat', 'utterly', 'addled', 'Australians', 'living', 'mere', 'stone', 'throw', 'away', 'major', 'airport', 'are', 'threatened', 'eviction', 'hovel', 'call', 'home', 'make', 'way', 'airport', 'expansion', 'concept', 'house', 'situated', 'virtually', 'busy', 'runway', 'may', 'strike', 'people', 'height', 'hilarity', 'joke', 'wearisome', 'when', 'stretched', 'extent', 'full', 'length', 'movie', 'father', 'family', 'daily', 'basis', 'Pangloss-like', 'view', 'best', 'possible', 'worlds', 'when', 'confronted', 'uncaring', 'menace', 'outside', 'world', 'who', 'fight', 'save', 'homestead', 'neighbors.', 'quot', 'Castle', 'quot', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'wild', 'daring', 'comedy', 'had', 'writers', 'not', 'settled', 'cast', 'characters', 'so', 'devoid', 'basic', 'human', 'intelligence', 'emerge', 'pathetic', 'rural', 'caricatures', 'towards', 'audience', 'can', 'feel', 'patronizingly', 'superior', 'slackjawed', 'quality', 'mindless', 'innocence', 'part', 'most', 'characters', 'results', 'broadness', 'comedy', 'essentially', 'robs', 'sophistication', 'Joke', 'joke', 'simply', 'flat', 'constant', 'repetition', 'various', 'series', 'jokes', 'father', 'inane', 'daily', 'awe', 'mundane', 'culinary', 'concoctions', 'wife', 'obsession', 'achieving', 'cutthroat', 'bargains', 'used', 'items', 'etc', 'what', 'little', 'humor', 'comical', 'concepts', 'carry', 'first', 'time', 'around.', 'quot', 'Castle', 'quot', 'well-intentioned', 'quot', 'quot', 'film', 'gravest', 'sin', 'comedy', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'simply', 'not', 'funny']",N/A

I initially wasn't enthused because the movie is described on the sleeve as ""This Year's Full Monty.""  I didn't like Full Monty that much.  Anyway, it was a Friday evening and it seemed the night for either a porno or a comedy and (as our daughter was still awake) the comedy prevailed and this was all we had in that category.Two minutes into the movie I knew it was going to be great.  This is a great family movie.  That might make you think it is boring, but I mean it is a great movie about a GREAT FAMILY.  This is about a family that doesn't know they are middle class (if not poor).  This is a family that is rich in love, loyalty, spirit, respect and dreams.  They are kind-hearted yet fearless in the face of unfairness and oppression.  The wife character recounts how she fell in love with the husband and it related to his sense of principle.  This is a great movie about PRINCIPLES. And these lofty subjects are somehow couched in a humorous setting for which it is hard to come up with an exact comparison, but suffice it to say I found every character very endearing, dimensional, rich.  I laughed so hard my eyes were tearing up.This is the type of movie that ""they"" ought to make often.  It promotes only good and healthy outlooks.  This is not a prudish movie by any means, but it is wholesome and positive and it makes you glad you share the planet with people in the hope that at least some of them are as good as the people portrayed in this movie.I had never even heard of this movie before seeing it.  Hopefully word will get out and the makers of this film will get the recognition they deserve, but nothing less than an Academy Award for Best Picture seems sufficient. This is not a cute little ""sleeper"" of a film.  It is a brilliant portrayal of an ideal family fighting together for principle.
