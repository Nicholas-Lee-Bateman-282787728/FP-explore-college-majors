The trouble is that there's nothing clever about it. So anybody who likes 'What's Up, Doc?' and thinks, Great, another Streisand/O'Neal movie I will enjoy, well, think again. Ryan O'Neal tries to be cute, but it looks like it's hard for him. Barbra's character is confusing: she starts as a high-powered business woman, but later in the film slips into 'vulnerable silly woman' character half the time. What's going on?And do we need another movie with endless scenes of boxing? No doubt they needed something to fill up the empty spaces in the plot, between the embarrassing 'that would NEVER happen' bits that spoil so much comedy.So what's good about this movie? Well, if you like Barbra Streisand, you get to see her, albeit with probably her worst ever hairdo.

713359,A2DS532SLTFWFK,B00006FDCE,Det. Abilene,"[17, 19]","This film was a major hit upon release in the summer of `79.  With a budget seven-million-dollars, the film took in over $40 million at the domestic box office and became one of the top-ten grossers of the year.  Unfortunately, it has since been written off by many fans and critics alike as one of Streisand's weakest film efforts.  As for myself, I believe THE MAIN EVENT manages to be likable, funny, and entertaining.  Even though we've seen the same story a thousand times before, THE MAIN EVENT is very enjoyable while it's playing.The scenes are all set up very well, the one-liners are funny (""I said celebrate, not fornicate ""), and Streisand and O'Neal give off a strong sexual charge between them onscreen.  The film also features a very strong supporting cast, with Paul Sand, Whitman Mayo, and Patti D'Arbanville turning in terrific performances.  Unfairly mangled by most critics and many viewers (many of whom need to learn how to loosen up), the film is complete fun from start to finish.  Ignore all of the naysayers, THE MAIN EVENT stands one of my favorite romantic comedies.About the DVD:  The picture quality is great, and the mono sound is fine as well.  It's great to have the original trailer and the 19-minute television special, titled GETTING IN SHAPE FOR THE MAIN EVENT, preserved on disc, although Streisand's brief audio commentary is slightly disappointing.",4,Much better than it's reputation,1112832000,"04 7, 2005",2005,1388,"['film', 'was', 'major', 'hit', 'release', 'summer', '79', 'budget', 'seven-million-dollars', 'film', 'took', '40', 'million', 'domestic', 'box', 'office', 'became', 'one', 'top-ten', 'grossers', 'year', 'Unfortunately', 'been', 'written', 'off', 'many', 'fans', 'critics', 'alike', 'one', 'Streisand', 'weakest', 'film', 'efforts', 'believe', 'MAIN', 'EVENT', 'be', 'likable', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'Even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'same', 'story', 'thousand', 'times', 'before', 'THE', 'MAIN', 'EVENT', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'playing.The', 'scenes', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'one-liners', 'are', 'funny', 'said', 'celebrate', 'not', 'fornicate', 'Streisand', ""O'Neal"", 'give', 'off', 'strong', 'sexual', 'charge', 'onscreen', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Paul', 'Sand', 'Whitman', 'Mayo', 'Patti', ""D'Arbanville"", 'turning', 'terrific', 'performances', 'Unfairly', 'mangled', 'most', 'critics', 'many', 'viewers', 'many', 'whom', 'need', 'learn', 'how', 'loosen', 'up', 'film', 'complete', 'fun', 'start', 'finish', 'Ignore', 'naysayers', 'THE', 'MAIN', 'EVENT', 'one', 'favorite', 'romantic', 'comedies.About', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'great', 'mono', 'sound', 'fine', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'have', 'original', 'trailer', '19-minute', 'television', 'special', 'titled', 'GETTING', 'IN', 'SHAPE', 'THE', 'MAIN', 'EVENT', 'preserved', 'disc', 'Streisand', 'brief', 'audio', 'commentary', 'slightly', 'disappointing']",The Main Event
