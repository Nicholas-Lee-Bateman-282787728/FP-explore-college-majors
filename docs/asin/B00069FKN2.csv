864058,AKV8PGQECV5O7,B00069FKN2,a consumer,"[6, 6]","I never got to see Miles perform during his early '70's electric period but I lived my life for listening to his records.  Getting to see this concert footage was a huge revelation.  I listened to ""Miles at the Fillmore"", which is basically the same group and set list as Isle of Wight, but it was heavily edited and jumpy.  And I'd seen Miles documentaries, but they would only feature a few minutes' footage of him in the '70's.  This film shows Miles in concert from start to finish for 38 minutes and it's like a slice of heaven.  You get to see Miles' intensity of concentration when playing and you get to hear the group's improvisations evolve naturally instead of being chopped up in a Teo Macero/Columbia records packaging nightmare.  This was a great band and Miles' chops were in top form.  There's no diminishing the level of musicianship in this concert--it's 100% prime.The music may be a bit challenging for those looking for ""Kind of Blue"".  The proper reference point is more properly ""Bitches Brew"".The rest of the film is frosting on the concert cake, so it doesn't really matter that they allowed Stanley Crouch an appearance to make his usual annoying comments (don't know who bugs me more quickly, him or O'Reilly). And it doesn't matter that they have interviews with Carlos Santana and Joni Mitchell, neither of whom really had anything to do with the concert or with Miles. The interviews with the band members are generally good, sometimes very insightful, and Airto's musical tribute to Miles at the end is a hoot.All in all, if you like anything from Miles' electric period, you'll like this.",5,Worth It For the Concert Footage Alone,1124582400,"08 21, 2005",2005,1620,"['never', 'got', 'see', 'Miles', 'perform', 'early', ""'70"", 'electric', 'period', 'lived', 'life', 'listening', 'records', 'Getting', 'see', 'concert', 'footage', 'was', 'huge', 'revelation', 'listened', 'Miles', 'Fillmore', 'basically', 'same', 'group', 'set', 'list', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'was', 'heavily', 'edited', 'jumpy', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Miles', 'documentaries', 'would', 'only', 'feature', 'few', 'minutes', 'footage', ""'70"", 'film', 'Miles', 'concert', 'start', 'finish', '38', 'minutes', 'slice', 'heaven', 'get', 'see', 'Miles', 'intensity', 'concentration', 'when', 'playing', 'get', 'hear', 'group', 'improvisations', 'evolve', 'naturally', 'instead', 'being', 'chopped', 'up', 'Teo', 'Macero/Columbia', 'records', 'packaging', 'nightmare', 'was', 'great', 'band', 'Miles', 'chops', 'were', 'top', 'form', 'diminishing', 'level', 'musicianship', 'concert', '100', '%', 'prime.The', 'music', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'challenging', 'looking', 'Kind', 'Blue', 'proper', 'reference', 'point', 'more', 'properly', 'Bitches', 'Brew', '.The', 'rest', 'film', 'frosting', 'concert', 'cake', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'allowed', 'Stanley', 'Crouch', 'appearance', 'make', 'usual', 'annoying', 'comments', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'more', 'quickly', ""O'Reilly"", ""n't"", 'matter', 'have', 'interviews', 'Carlos', 'Santana', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'neither', 'whom', 'really', 'had', 'anything', 'do', 'concert', 'Miles', 'interviews', 'band', 'members', 'are', 'generally', 'good', 'sometimes', 'very', 'insightful', 'Airto', 'musical', 'tribute', 'Miles', 'end', 'hoot.All', 'like', 'anything', 'Miles', 'electric', 'period', ""'ll"", 'like']",N/A

864060,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B00069FKN2,Christopher Culver,"[1, 2]","MILES ELECTRIC is a documentary about Miles Davis' turn to electric instruments and long jams at the end of the 1960s, told through interviews and concert footage. Special attention is given to the 1970 performance at the Isle of Wight festival, where this new kind of music reached a live audience of 600,000.The creators of the documentary were able to assemble a number of musicians who worked with Miles in the period. Besides prominent figures like Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett and (disgustingly) Chick Corea, there are also interviews with lesser-known figures from the ""On the Corner"" album and live setups. The representative of jazz criticism--and the main antagonist of electric-period Miles--is Stanley Crouch. His gadfly antics were brought in to give some balance to the documentary, but the sort of fans who would buy this DVD probably won't much agree with him.There are also interviews with figures only remotely connected to Miles Davis and his new music. Carlos Santana gives some insightful remarks on the spirit of the era, though he gets a bit too much attention, and the inclusion of Santana concert footage seems inappropriate considering that this is a documentary about Miles. Joni Mitchell is interviewed once the documentary begins to focus on the Isle of Wight performance, but as other reviewers have commented, she hardly belongs here.Even if you have already read extensively on Miles' history as a musician and don't need the documentary, the DVD is a worthy purchase for the complete 37-minute set at the Isle of Wight festival. This performance has all that is best about Miles' music at the time: a large ensemble, a paradoxical cohension as everyone does their own thing, and the general sense that doing this was *fun*. It is a pity that the set is part of the documentary itself instead of on another section of the DVD (though one can hunt for it in the documentary menu). However, the inclusion of the performance serves to split the documentary into a first half on Miles' transition to electric and a second on Miles' general aesthetic and influence.The presence of Joni Mitchell and Carlos Santana makes the documentary less than perfect, and the Isle of Wight set ranks a bit lower than other live performances available, but this is a very entertaining DVDs for fans of the great jazz innovator and his students.",4,A fine documentary with a 37-minute live performance,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,2358,"['MILES', 'ELECTRIC', 'documentary', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'turn', 'electric', 'instruments', 'long', 'jams', 'end', '1960s', 'told', 'interviews', 'concert', 'footage', 'Special', 'attention', 'given', '1970', 'performance', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'festival', 'where', 'new', 'kind', 'music', 'reached', 'live', 'audience', '600,000.The', 'creators', 'documentary', 'were', 'able', 'assemble', 'number', 'musicians', 'who', 'worked', 'Miles', 'period', 'prominent', 'figures', 'Herbie', 'Hancock', 'Keith', 'Jarrett', 'disgustingly', 'Chick', 'Corea', 'are', 'also', 'interviews', 'lesser-known', 'figures', 'Corner', 'album', 'live', 'setups', 'representative', 'jazz', 'criticism', 'main', 'antagonist', 'electric-period', 'Miles', 'Stanley', 'Crouch', 'gadfly', 'antics', 'were', 'brought', 'give', 'balance', 'documentary', 'sort', 'fans', 'who', 'would', 'buy', 'DVD', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'much', 'agree', 'him.There', 'are', 'also', 'interviews', 'figures', 'only', 'remotely', 'connected', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'new', 'music', 'Carlos', 'Santana', 'insightful', 'remarks', 'spirit', 'era', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'inclusion', 'Santana', 'concert', 'footage', 'inappropriate', 'considering', 'documentary', 'Miles', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'interviewed', 'documentary', 'focus', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'performance', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'hardly', 'here.Even', 'have', 'already', 'read', 'extensively', 'Miles', 'history', 'musician', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'documentary', 'DVD', 'worthy', 'purchase', 'complete', '37-minute', 'set', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'festival', 'performance', 'best', 'Miles', 'music', 'time', 'large', 'ensemble', 'paradoxical', 'cohension', 'everyone', 'own', 'thing', 'general', 'sense', 'doing', 'was', '*fun*', 'pity', 'set', 'part', 'documentary', 'instead', 'section', 'DVD', 'one', 'can', 'hunt', 'documentary', 'menu', 'However', 'inclusion', 'performance', 'split', 'documentary', 'first', 'half', 'Miles', 'transition', 'electric', 'second', 'Miles', 'general', 'aesthetic', 'influence.The', 'presence', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'Carlos', 'Santana', 'documentary', 'less', 'perfect', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'set', 'bit', 'lower', 'other', 'live', 'performances', 'available', 'very', 'entertaining', 'DVDs', 'fans', 'great', 'jazz', 'innovator', 'students']",N/A

864062,A14PS3LPIO7UF8,B00069FKN2,"Dawoud Kringle ""Renegade Sufi""","[2, 2]","For me, the whole ""Bitches Brew"" period was a necessary step in where ""jazz"" had to go. The other ""free"" players had not caught up with the electric / electronic developments that the rock players were mastering (at least a few did; like Hendrix). Miles brought them together; blurring lines and violating the boundaries in service of a greater vision.While there may have been a few moments during ""Bitches Brew"" that may have meandered a bit, the whole point of that recording was that it was a big risk. A gamble by walking into musical territory that had not yet been created. But while the recordings were great, that situation works best when it is performed live.The Isle or Wight performance exemplified this marvelously. All the musicians walked on stage for that gig and delivered with no idea what was going to happen. Let's face it; few musicians have both the courage and the skill to do that. This performance was exemplary of what could be done.One thing I particularly liked about it was how Miles led the band. In this he had few peers. I saw Miles live, and his band leading skills were the best I ever saw of anyone (Frank Zappa came a close second). A single phrase or an inflection on a single note, and the whole band reacted, seemingly as a reflex or instinct, and the direction of the music changed.I enjoyed some of the interview parts of the DVD. I was, ironically, glad that Stanley Crouch was given the chance to vent his feelings (even if I vehemently disagree with him - he's entitled to his opinions, despite the danger that they may unduly influence others). But once all the talk was out of the way, the actual performance itself was presented in its entirety to stand up on its own merit.What Miles Davis accomplished during that phase was both unprecedented, and musically as beautiful as it was dangerous and insurrectionist - as real as love and revolution.",5,Free Miles,1222819200,"10 1, 2008",2008,1894,"['whole', 'Bitches', 'Brew', 'period', 'was', 'necessary', 'step', 'where', 'jazz', 'had', 'go', 'other', 'free', 'players', 'had', 'not', 'caught', 'up', 'electric', '/', 'electronic', 'developments', 'rock', 'players', 'were', 'mastering', 'least', 'few', 'did', 'Hendrix', 'Miles', 'brought', 'together', 'blurring', 'lines', 'violating', 'boundaries', 'service', 'greater', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'moments', 'Bitches', 'Brew', 'may', 'have', 'meandered', 'bit', 'whole', 'point', 'recording', 'was', 'was', 'big', 'risk', 'gamble', 'walking', 'musical', 'territory', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'created', 'recordings', 'were', 'great', 'situation', 'best', 'when', 'performed', 'live.The', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'performance', 'exemplified', 'marvelously', 'musicians', 'walked', 'stage', 'gig', 'delivered', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'Let', 'face', 'few', 'musicians', 'have', 'courage', 'skill', 'do', 'performance', 'was', 'exemplary', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'done.One', 'thing', 'particularly', 'liked', 'was', 'how', 'Miles', 'led', 'band', 'had', 'few', 'peers', 'saw', 'Miles', 'live', 'band', 'leading', 'skills', 'were', 'best', 'ever', 'saw', 'anyone', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'came', 'close', 'second', 'single', 'phrase', 'inflection', 'single', 'note', 'whole', 'band', 'reacted', 'seemingly', 'reflex', 'instinct', 'direction', 'music', 'changed.I', 'enjoyed', 'interview', 'parts', 'DVD', 'was', 'ironically', 'glad', 'Stanley', 'Crouch', 'was', 'given', 'chance', 'vent', 'feelings', 'even', 'vehemently', 'disagree', 'entitled', 'opinions', 'danger', 'may', 'unduly', 'influence', 'others', 'once', 'talk', 'was', 'way', 'actual', 'performance', 'was', 'presented', 'entirety', 'stand', 'up', 'own', 'merit.What', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'accomplished', 'phase', 'was', 'unprecedented', 'musically', 'as', 'beautiful', 'was', 'dangerous', 'insurrectionist', 'as', 'real', 'love', 'revolution']",N/A

With little tiny clips that just kill then they are withdrawn. Frankly I don't care so much who Miles was personally. We all have our good and bad points. But... I LOVE his music... or what ever it was... that SOUND. That challenge! Miles heads know what I mean by this...So I'm watching this thinking ""Oh my god, not ANOTHER Miles movie with talk, talk, talk..."" But then finally...Thirty Eight minutes of Miles. Almost like it should be with no stops, no comments. Just Miles and his band. Isn't that what it's really about?The MUSIC. The ART.Like much of Miles' music from this period it's extremely uneven, up and down but the ups are so brilliant they are astonishing, like some kind of magic. Basically this is Miles' band from the Black Beauty/Live At Fillmore period - the NOT Bitches Brew period. It's very experimental, doesn't always work but always pushes and questions. This is Miles getting ready for Bitches Brew and the later stuff that still hasn't been equaled or even touched really. Heck this stuff hasn't been touched. Music hasn't really evolved much from Miles Magus period.This gets 4 stars from me only because I know there is better Miles stuff out there.My only complains are small. Too many close ups. I want to see the whole BAND 90% of the time not a close up. This is a jazz band interacting. That's the interesting part not the solos. And a bit too many cuts. For all those music video editors who think they are on the cutting edge... MTV editing is a banal clich&eacute;. Everyone does the fast cutting thing. It adds nothing. Especially to music like this that forces contemplation.Anyway these are really small complaints.Like others I'd like to see some of the later bands too. PLEASE CBS let us spend our money on you!!! Release the Live/Evil, Agarta, Dark Magus stuff on DVD too.Actually the talking is not too bad on this. Some good insights. It's amazing how inarticulate the band members are about what made them tick during their school days with Miles. Pete Cosey is, I think, a standout. He's STILL some kind of way out goblin. And Santana is surprisingly articulate which is strange as he hardly ever actually played with Miles. I heard he was just too intimidated. I have a tape of one performance he did with Miles that's really really good though. What happened to Santana? Why isn't he doing anything that's anything? Despite what others have said about Joni Mitchell she too is articulate about Miles. And the short clips of her getting dissed by an audience are way cool.Humorously, Miles got BOTTOM billing at Isle of Wight!!!??? In retrospect that makes us all seem pretty stupid, even though we weren't really stupid. It's just Miles was so damn good he was so far ahead of us we couldn't see 'till it was gone!Thank you Dewey...",4,"As others have said FINALLY, FINALLY!!!",1137888000,"01 22, 2006",2006,2870,"['Sheech', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'videos', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'talking', 'Miles', 'Talk', 'talk', 'talk', 'little', 'tiny', 'clips', 'just', 'kill', 'then', 'are', 'withdrawn', 'Frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'so', 'much', 'who', 'Miles', 'was', 'personally', 'have', 'good', 'bad', 'points', 'LOVE', 'music', 'what', 'ever', 'was', 'SOUND', 'challenge', 'Miles', 'heads', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'So', ""'m"", 'watching', 'thinking', 'Oh', 'god', 'not', 'ANOTHER', 'Miles', 'movie', 'talk', 'talk', 'talk', 'then', 'finally', 'Thirty', 'Eight', 'minutes', 'Miles', 'Almost', 'should', 'be', 'stops', 'comments', 'Just', 'Miles', 'band', ""n't"", 'what', 'really', 'about', 'MUSIC', 'ART.Like', 'much', 'Miles', 'music', 'period', 'extremely', 'uneven', 'up', 'down', 'ups', 'are', 'so', 'brilliant', 'are', 'astonishing', 'kind', 'magic', 'Basically', 'Miles', 'band', 'Black', 'Beauty/Live', 'Fillmore', 'period', 'NOT', 'Bitches', 'Brew', 'period', 'very', 'experimental', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'always', 'pushes', 'questions', 'Miles', 'getting', 'ready', 'Bitches', 'Brew', 'later', 'stuff', 'still', ""n't"", 'been', 'equaled', 'even', 'touched', 'really', 'Heck', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'been', 'touched', 'Music', ""n't"", 'really', 'evolved', 'much', 'Miles', 'Magus', 'period.This', '4', 'stars', 'only', 'know', 'better', 'Miles', 'out', 'only', 'complains', 'are', 'small', 'Too', 'many', 'close', 'ups', 'want', 'see', 'whole', 'BAND', '90', '%', 'time', 'not', 'close', 'up', 'jazz', 'band', 'interacting', 'interesting', 'part', 'not', 'solos', 'bit', 'too', 'many', 'cuts', 'music', 'video', 'editors', 'who', 'think', 'are', 'cutting', 'edge', 'MTV', 'editing', 'banal', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Everyone', 'fast', 'cutting', 'thing', 'nothing', 'Especially', 'music', 'contemplation.Anyway', 'are', 'really', 'small', 'complaints.Like', 'others', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'later', 'bands', 'too', 'PLEASE', 'CBS', 'let', 'spend', 'money', 'Release', 'Live/Evil', 'Agarta', 'Dark', 'Magus', 'stuff', 'DVD', 'too.Actually', 'talking', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'good', 'insights', 'amazing', 'how', 'inarticulate', 'band', 'members', 'are', 'what', 'made', 'tick', 'school', 'days', 'Miles', 'Pete', 'Cosey', 'think', 'standout', 'STILL', 'kind', 'way', 'goblin', 'Santana', 'surprisingly', 'articulate', 'strange', 'hardly', 'ever', 'actually', 'played', 'Miles', 'heard', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'intimidated', 'have', 'tape', 'one', 'performance', 'did', 'Miles', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'though', 'What', 'happened', 'Santana', 'Why', ""n't"", 'doing', 'anything', 'anything', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'too', 'articulate', 'Miles', 'short', 'clips', 'getting', 'dissed', 'audience', 'are', 'way', 'cool.Humorously', 'Miles', 'got', 'BOTTOM', 'billing', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'retrospect', 'seem', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'stupid', 'just', 'Miles', 'was', 'so', 'damn', 'good', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'ahead', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', ""'till"", 'was', 'gone', 'Thank', 'Dewey']",N/A

There are plenty of interviews with musicians from Miles' band at the time, like Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Jack DeJohnette, Airto, Dave Holland.  Other greats like Carlos Santana and Marcus Miller, who worked extensively with Miles in the 80s, offer additional insight into the genius that was Miles Davis.  Miles' groundbreaking electric jazz/rock experiments are put into context by explaining how Miles was being influenced by Jimi Hendrix, Sly, James Brown and other black pioneers of the 60s.

Time will tell for sure on the worth of this music. My comments are concerned with what I got out of the DVD and are not concerned with the musical content or brilliance or otherwise of the actual concert.  There is a lot of music on the DVD but its ART is more in the voices of the musicians talking about Miles and their music and their part in making it. In talking about an abstract art like music, words do seem inadequate or pretentious, but I don't knock the musicians for trying. There are some absolutely electric moments - metaphorically speaking and two of them come at the end. The first is where Airto is asked to give a brief musical tribute to Miles. The man uses his voice, his body, his whole being and seems to become the band on stage - it is a truly magic few minutes and my admiration for Airto went way up as I realised that this man breathes music. Again you have reinforced before your very eyes the truth that Miles genius included a deep understanding of what makes a great musician - he picked the best.  THe second great moment for me, was when Mr Hancock was asked to do the same thing and he sat there in silence for it seemed minutes - that too was electric in its feeling where all our thoughts rush into that silence.  You see,  Miles understood the power of silence too, the use of space, why he admired Ahmad Jamal, and he would have beathed a breath of satisfaction at these two tributes.It's a well directed DVD with rich colour, and lots of music aside from the concert.

Lund ""jazzbrat""","[114, 114]","With most of the audio portion of Miles Davis' remarkable career now extensively issued or reissued (including the Sony/Columbia boxed sets that included unreleased sessions and alternate takes), video is the next and possibly final frontier for filling in the gaps of Davis' prolific and consistently productive career.  Several DVDs covering Miles' underrated final years (1985-1991) have already been issued (and rumors persist that the 20-CD Montreux box may someday have a DVD counterpart, which would be an amazing feat if it comes to pass).  Now MILES ELECTRIC cracks open the vaults to the 1960s and 1970s, hopefully the first of many vintage Davis videos to come.Miles' 1970 Isle Of Wight performance before 600,000 fans had attained legendary status over the decades, but until now only a few audio soundbites had been issued (and remarkably the entire set was never bootlegged).  MILES ELECTRIC includes but is not limited to the entire 38-minute IOW performance.  In 1970 Davis was perhaps in his all-time peak physical condition, and musically confident of his ability to bridge his jazz-based roots with the more adventurous pop culture sounds of that era.  His trumpet work here seems limitless technically and full of fresh improvisatory ideas.  And contrary his (exaggerated?) reputation, Davis is seen acknowledging the crowd with a wave of his horn when leaving the stage as the performance ends.The rest of the group is similiarly adventurous, including Chick Corea and Keith Jarrett on keyboards, Gary Bartz on sax, Dave Holland on bass, Jack DeJohnette on drums, and Airto Moreira on various percussion.  What more can you ask for than a collection of outstanding musicians -- all first-tier names in the music's history -- thinking outside the box in a variety of ways?  By the way, the video looks crisp and the sound (with two surround options in addition to stereo) is clear and well-balanced, with just some slight distortion on Miles' trumpet at times (but not to a bothersome extent).  Considering the recording conditions, the audio and video turned out very well.Notice that the DVD has a running time of 123 minutes, while the concert itself is 38m.  What the producers decided for this release was to surround the IOW gig with a documentary that puts Davis' ""electric era"" into proper context, with interviews of the IOW bandmembers (all of whom are currently still alive and musically active except of course for Miles, who is nonetheless heard via interview clips from the 1980s).  Also interviewed are other Davis associates and a few critics, including the infamous Stanley Crouch (who seems to be the first option when a dissenting voice regarding Miles' post-1969 career is needed).  Although the performance isn't complete (wish that were a bonus option), there is an equally-thrilling 1964 clip from the Steve Allen show of Davis and his quintet playing ""So What.""",5,"At Last, The Complete 1970 Isle Of Wight Gig Plus More!",1101600000,"11 28, 2004",2004,2905,"['most', 'audio', 'portion', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'remarkable', 'career', 'now', 'extensively', 'issued', 'reissued', 'including', 'Sony/Columbia', 'boxed', 'sets', 'included', 'unreleased', 'sessions', 'alternate', 'video', 'next', 'possibly', 'final', 'frontier', 'filling', 'gaps', 'Davis', 'prolific', 'consistently', 'productive', 'career', 'Several', 'DVDs', 'covering', 'Miles', 'underrated', 'final', 'years', '1985-1991', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'issued', 'rumors', 'persist', '20-CD', 'Montreux', 'box', 'may', 'someday', 'have', 'DVD', 'counterpart', 'would', 'be', 'amazing', 'feat', 'pass', 'Now', 'MILES', 'ELECTRIC', 'cracks', 'open', 'vaults', '1960s', '1970s', 'hopefully', 'first', 'many', 'vintage', 'Davis', 'videos', 'come.Miles', '1970', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'performance', '600,000', 'fans', 'had', 'attained', 'legendary', 'status', 'decades', 'now', 'only', 'few', 'audio', 'soundbites', 'had', 'been', 'issued', 'remarkably', 'entire', 'set', 'was', 'never', 'bootlegged', 'MILES', 'ELECTRIC', 'not', 'limited', 'entire', '38-minute', 'IOW', 'performance', '1970', 'Davis', 'was', 'perhaps', 'all-time', 'peak', 'physical', 'condition', 'musically', 'confident', 'ability', 'bridge', 'jazz-based', 'roots', 'more', 'adventurous', 'pop', 'culture', 'era', 'trumpet', 'work', 'here', 'limitless', 'technically', 'full', 'fresh', 'improvisatory', 'ideas', 'contrary', 'exaggerated', 'reputation', 'Davis', 'seen', 'acknowledging', 'crowd', 'wave', 'horn', 'when', 'leaving', 'stage', 'performance', 'ends.The', 'rest', 'group', 'similiarly', 'adventurous', 'including', 'Chick', 'Corea', 'Keith', 'Jarrett', 'keyboards', 'Gary', 'Bartz', 'sax', 'Dave', 'Holland', 'bass', 'Jack', 'DeJohnette', 'drums', 'Airto', 'Moreira', 'various', 'percussion', 'What', 'more', 'can', 'ask', 'collection', 'outstanding', 'musicians', 'first-tier', 'names', 'music', 'history', 'thinking', 'box', 'variety', 'ways', 'way', 'video', 'crisp', 'sound', 'two', 'surround', 'options', 'addition', 'stereo', 'clear', 'well-balanced', 'just', 'slight', 'distortion', 'Miles', 'trumpet', 'times', 'not', 'bothersome', 'extent', 'Considering', 'recording', 'conditions', 'audio', 'video', 'turned', 'out', 'very', 'well.Notice', 'DVD', 'running', 'time', '123', 'minutes', 'concert', '38m', 'What', 'producers', 'decided', 'release', 'was', 'surround', 'IOW', 'gig', 'documentary', 'Davis', 'electric', 'era', 'proper', 'context', 'interviews', 'IOW', 'bandmembers', 'whom', 'are', 'currently', 'still', 'alive', 'musically', 'active', 'course', 'Miles', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'heard', 'interview', 'clips', '1980s', 'Also', 'interviewed', 'are', 'other', 'Davis', 'associates', 'few', 'critics', 'including', 'infamous', 'Stanley', 'Crouch', 'who', 'be', 'first', 'option', 'when', 'dissenting', 'voice', 'regarding', 'Miles', 'post-1969', 'career', 'needed', 'performance', ""n't"", 'complete', 'wish', 'were', 'bonus', 'option', 'equally-thrilling', '1964', 'clip', 'Steve', 'Allen', 'show', 'Davis', 'quintet', 'playing', 'So', 'What']",N/A

Dave holland: bass.  jack dejonette: drums. Airto Moreira: percussion, pueka. gary bartz: saxaphone, clarinet. then the actual concert infront of 600,000 people. its amazing how they can pull of that sound with only 7 people.  Then thew have the interviewed musicians play a miles tribute.  Also in the bonus special features there are more interviews and in the cd rom only you can see all the places that miles played during the 70s period.
