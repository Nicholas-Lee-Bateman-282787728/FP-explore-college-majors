Ginger is at a wealthy girls finishing school wherein the faculty is more concerned about keeping up appearances than anything else.  The message is the girls can smoke and so forth, as long as they don't get caught.  Well, in comes an innocent new girl and Ginger leads her down the path of getting away with things.  Well, eventually the new girl gets involved with a medical student and nature takes its course.  This movie has value as a reflection of the times, but it is kind of a sad plot.  Definitely not her usual happy go lucky dance films.",1,"Ginger is good, but plot not so hot.",1303516800,"04 23, 2011",2011,629,"['precode', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'why', 'code', 'was', 'so', 'effective', 'Ginger', 'wealthy', 'girls', 'finishing', 'school', 'wherein', 'faculty', 'more', 'concerned', 'keeping', 'up', 'appearances', 'anything', 'else', 'message', 'girls', 'can', 'smoke', 'so', 'forth', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'caught', 'Well', 'innocent', 'new', 'girl', 'Ginger', 'down', 'path', 'getting', 'away', 'things', 'Well', 'eventually', 'new', 'girl', 'involved', 'medical', 'student', 'nature', 'course', 'movie', 'value', 'reflection', 'times', 'kind', 'sad', 'plot', 'Definitely', 'not', 'usual', 'happy', 'go', 'lucky', 'dance', 'films']",Finishing School VHS

Ginger is not the lead but I hadn't really seen much of Frances Dee before so it was good to see this beautiful actress perform.

304872,A2WWP26JPPGPFR,6302270405,Maddie,"[0, 0]","Not half as racy as the blurb would have you believe.  Ginger Rogers does not 'mother hen' her classmate through a wild weekend in New York.  They sneak away form their chaperone and Virginia does admit that 'she's always wanted to get a little tight (drunk).' Her date tries to get a little fresh and she is saved by a nice waiter (in med school, therefore not entirely socially unacceptable).  As the movie progresses Virginia and the intern (oops, forgot his name!) fall in love.  Their relationship is not allowed by the school, who want all the students to marry up, so Virginia is forbidden to see him.At Christmas Virginia is alone at the school and considers having a drink to cheer herself up but realised how pathetic it would be.  She looks at the presents from her parents, a cheque and a fur coat with the receipt enclosed, not even a card from her mother.  She despairs... then there is a tap at the window- her boyfriend.  They sneak away to the boat house and he gives her a set of handkerchiefs he had embroidered with her initial.  Awww!  And the camera pans away...After this all his calls are intercepted, his letters thrown away, her letters likewise.  She becomes mysteriously unwell, not herself and the dean recommends that she see the school doctor.  Virginia becomes hysterical, crying that she cannot see the doctor, simply cannot!  Ginger Rogers realises the problem and calls the intern to come and face his responsibilities immediately.  She escapes to the balcony and thinks about throwing herself off but she sees the intern's car arriving.  She rushes down to meet him and he mans up very nicely.  As they leave (presumably to get a special licence) her father offers him a cigar (like the kind given to new fathers at the birth of their child).So, the blurb says that Virginia ends up pregnant and unpunished.  Sorry, but the 1930's  didn't swing that way.  If she'd been found out Virginia would never have been welcome in another polite family's house ever again.  Her child would not be welcome.  Her grandchild would still feel bitter about the way she was treated.  That's why it was so important for her to have her boyfriend come riding to the rescue at the end.The storyline was frank compared to late movies and it was banned.  Virginia gets drunk, considers a little light secret drinking to console herself.  She sleeps with her boyfriend but that part is portrayed as a nice girl who succumbs to love when she feels lonely.  The viewer feels sorry for her, these days, but in the forties the movie would have been too shocking to be shown to general audiences.These days, it's a great movie.",5,Charming story,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,2637,"['Not', 'half', 'as', 'racy', 'blurb', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'not', ""'mother"", 'hen', 'classmate', 'wild', 'weekend', 'New', 'York', 'sneak', 'away', 'form', 'chaperone', 'Virginia', 'admit', 'always', 'wanted', 'get', 'little', 'tight', 'drunk', 'date', 'tries', 'get', 'little', 'fresh', 'saved', 'nice', 'waiter', 'med', 'school', 'therefore', 'not', 'entirely', 'socially', 'unacceptable', 'movie', 'Virginia', 'intern', 'oops', 'forgot', 'name', 'fall', 'love', 'relationship', 'not', 'allowed', 'school', 'who', 'want', 'students', 'marry', 'up', 'Virginia', 'forbidden', 'see', 'him.At', 'Christmas', 'Virginia', 'alone', 'school', 'considers', 'having', 'drink', 'cheer', 'up', 'realised', 'how', 'pathetic', 'would', 'be', 'presents', 'parents', 'cheque', 'fur', 'coat', 'receipt', 'enclosed', 'not', 'even', 'card', 'mother', 'despairs', 'then', 'tap', 'window-', 'boyfriend', 'sneak', 'away', 'boat', 'house', 'set', 'handkerchiefs', 'had', 'embroidered', 'initial', 'Awww', 'camera', 'away', 'calls', 'are', 'intercepted', 'letters', 'thrown', 'away', 'letters', 'likewise', 'mysteriously', 'unwell', 'not', 'dean', 'see', 'school', 'doctor', 'Virginia', 'hysterical', 'crying', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'doctor', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'problem', 'intern', 'come', 'face', 'responsibilities', 'immediately', 'balcony', 'throwing', 'off', 'intern', 'car', 'arriving', 'down', 'meet', 'up', 'very', 'nicely', 'leave', 'presumably', 'get', 'special', 'licence', 'father', 'cigar', 'kind', 'given', 'new', 'fathers', 'birth', 'child', '.So', 'blurb', 'Virginia', 'up', 'pregnant', 'unpunished', 'Sorry', '1930', 'did', ""n't"", 'swing', 'way', ""'d"", 'been', 'found', 'Virginia', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'welcome', 'polite', 'family', 'house', 'ever', 'again', 'child', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'welcome', 'grandchild', 'would', 'still', 'feel', 'bitter', 'way', 'was', 'treated', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'important', 'have', 'boyfriend', 'come', 'riding', 'rescue', 'end.The', 'storyline', 'was', 'frank', 'compared', 'late', 'movies', 'was', 'banned', 'Virginia', 'drunk', 'little', 'light', 'secret', 'drinking', 'console', 'boyfriend', 'part', 'portrayed', 'nice', 'girl', 'who', 'love', 'when', 'lonely', 'viewer', 'feels', 'sorry', 'days', 'forties', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'shocking', 'be', 'shown', 'general', 'audiences.These', 'days', 'great', 'movie']",Finishing School VHS

304874,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,6302270405,William Timothy Lukeman,"[7, 7]","Here's another forgotten pre-Code gem that's been revived by the Warner Archive -- and what sharp edges it has, too! Frances Dee stars as young & nave socialite Virginia, newly enrolled in an incredibly snobbish finishing school for the wealthy & privileged. Her mother is flighty, her father distant, and she's essentially thrown to the wolves ... though these wolves wear pearls & minks.Ginger Rogers, in an early role, portrays the cheerfully amoral but basically decent Pony, who befriends Virginia & tries to show her the velvet ropes of her hew life. But Virginia has a stubborn, individualistic streak & simply won't play along, going so far as to fall in love with Bruce Cabot's d&eacute;class&eacute; medical student Ralph. This leads to a snowy night, an empty cottage, a crackling fireplace, and the camera moving discreetly away from the passionate couple ...Of course, Virginia winds up pregnant, afraid to tell anyone, and goes into a suicidal depression -- but she's never ashamed of her love for Ralph or her intimate evening with him. It's not guilt that seems to afflict her so much as it is the cold & ruthless world in which she lives, with a class-conscious school more concerned with the possibility of scandal, loss of funds, and Virginia's nonconformity than with her well-being. It's a reminder of just how fiercely populist early films were, even a romantic melodrama like this. The snobbery & outright contempt shown by the upper class was always a deserving target!Not a film for the ages by any means, but still quite entertaining, with a bit of a social sting for good measure -- recommended!",4,Finishing school nearly finishes off sweet Virginia,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,1622,"['Here', 'forgotten', 'pre-Code', 'gem', 'been', 'revived', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'what', 'sharp', 'too', 'Frances', 'Dee', 'stars', 'young', 'nave', 'socialite', 'Virginia', 'newly', 'enrolled', 'incredibly', 'snobbish', 'finishing', 'school', 'wealthy', 'privileged', 'mother', 'flighty', 'father', 'distant', 'essentially', 'thrown', 'wolves', 'wolves', 'wear', 'pearls', 'minks.Ginger', 'Rogers', 'early', 'role', 'cheerfully', 'amoral', 'basically', 'decent', 'Pony', 'who', 'Virginia', 'tries', 'show', 'velvet', 'ropes', 'hew', 'life', 'Virginia', 'stubborn', 'individualistic', 'streak', 'simply', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'along', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'fall', 'love', 'Bruce', 'Cabot', 'd', 'eacute', 'class', 'eacute', 'medical', 'student', 'Ralph', 'snowy', 'night', 'empty', 'cottage', 'crackling', 'fireplace', 'camera', 'moving', 'discreetly', 'away', 'passionate', 'couple', 'course', 'Virginia', 'up', 'pregnant', 'afraid', 'tell', 'anyone', 'suicidal', 'depression', 'never', 'ashamed', 'love', 'Ralph', 'intimate', 'evening', 'not', 'guilt', 'afflict', 'so', 'much', 'cold', 'ruthless', 'world', 'class-conscious', 'school', 'more', 'concerned', 'possibility', 'scandal', 'loss', 'funds', 'Virginia', 'nonconformity', 'well-being', 'reminder', 'just', 'how', 'fiercely', 'populist', 'early', 'films', 'were', 'even', 'romantic', 'melodrama', 'snobbery', 'outright', 'contempt', 'shown', 'upper', 'class', 'was', 'always', 'deserving', 'target', 'Not', 'film', 'ages', 'means', 'still', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'bit', 'social', 'sting', 'good', 'measure', 'recommended']",Finishing School VHS
