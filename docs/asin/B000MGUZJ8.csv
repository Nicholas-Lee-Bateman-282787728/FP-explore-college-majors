1046696,A13GEXUA4SJ8J5,B000MGUZJ8,Carol Hunt,"[2, 2]","I watched this movie on cable one night.  I have never seen anything like it before.  The movie is designed to break stereotypical patterns that reoccur in film.  You see that from the start when the hero in the story is a stoner that doesn't want to be one. He isn't the perfect, desirable man.  In layman's terms, he is a looser.  Luke Wilson does not fit the role of a stoner, and by everything that I can see in the film, he really isn't intended to fit the role.  He is more of a lost soul hanging around friends that he doesn't want and doesn't' need. The contention in the movie is that he comes into contact with Witt, and doesn't want to throw her away even though she is a mess and problematic for him. Wilson often plays these characters that cling to an unconventional lover because of empathy with their condition.  We saw this same role in Home Fries, the Royal Tenebums, and Idiocracy.Alicia Witt's character is really the lead character in this film, which has duel main characters.  Wilson's character is messed up when Witt's character begins hanging around the house.  The entire movie revolves around the personality of Alicia Witt that is playing a Gemini that cannot keep herself out of trouble.  If you don't get the astrology, you won't like the film.  The whole film revolves around Witt's character traits; she is clever, likes to tinker, cannot shut up, and lies. She claims she is a Pisces when she is not because she enjoys trickery. She also gets herself into trouble because she likes to play games and cannot handle boredom.  If you do not enjoy that aspect of the movie, there is nothing to this film.I would say that the strong points of the movie are the realistic sex relationships, Witt's character, and the inclusion of couples that are not heterosexual.  It is intended to look like an average neighborhood with people that behave more realistically than typical love stories.  They have enormous problems and are not where they want to be in their lives. I am not sure how this film is going to pull off a comedy; some of the scenes are amusing because life is somewhat amusing at times.  No comedy that I know includes a rape scene and it isn't entirely a comedic show.  If the film displays any meaningful message at all it is that of people living their lives, while the movie portrays a negative image of drug users, and it is not intended to condone drug use.  It is more or less emphasizing the positive traits of people who partake in a liberal culture while also depicting what is wrong with stoning.  I like the film.",5,"The movie is interesting, but it isn't funny",1263340800,"01 13, 2010",2010,2566,"['watched', 'movie', 'cable', 'one', 'night', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'movie', 'designed', 'break', 'stereotypical', 'patterns', 'reoccur', 'film', 'see', 'start', 'when', 'hero', 'story', 'stoner', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'one', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'desirable', 'man', 'layman', 'terms', 'looser', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'not', 'fit', 'role', 'stoner', 'everything', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'intended', 'fit', 'role', 'more', 'lost', 'soul', 'hanging', 'around', ""n't"", 'want', ""n't"", 'need', 'contention', 'movie', 'contact', 'Witt', ""n't"", 'want', 'throw', 'away', 'even', 'mess', 'problematic', 'Wilson', 'often', 'characters', 'cling', 'unconventional', 'lover', 'empathy', 'condition', 'saw', 'same', 'role', 'Home', 'Fries', 'Royal', 'Tenebums', 'Idiocracy.Alicia', 'Witt', 'character', 'really', 'lead', 'character', 'film', 'duel', 'main', 'characters', 'Wilson', 'character', 'messed', 'up', 'when', 'Witt', 'character', 'hanging', 'house', 'entire', 'movie', 'personality', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'playing', 'Gemini', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'trouble', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'astrology', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'whole', 'film', 'revolves', 'Witt', 'character', 'traits', 'clever', 'likes', 'tinker', 'can', 'not', 'shut', 'up', 'Pisces', 'when', 'not', 'trickery', 'also', 'trouble', 'play', 'games', 'can', 'not', 'handle', 'boredom', 'do', 'not', 'enjoy', 'aspect', 'movie', 'nothing', 'film.I', 'would', 'say', 'strong', 'points', 'movie', 'are', 'realistic', 'sex', 'relationships', 'Witt', 'character', 'inclusion', 'couples', 'are', 'not', 'heterosexual', 'intended', 'look', 'average', 'neighborhood', 'people', 'behave', 'more', 'realistically', 'typical', 'love', 'stories', 'have', 'enormous', 'problems', 'are', 'not', 'where', 'want', 'be', 'lives', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'film', 'going', 'pull', 'off', 'comedy', 'scenes', 'are', 'amusing', 'life', 'somewhat', 'amusing', 'times', 'comedy', 'know', 'rape', 'scene', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'comedic', 'show', 'film', 'meaningful', 'message', 'people', 'living', 'lives', 'movie', 'negative', 'image', 'drug', 'users', 'not', 'intended', 'condone', 'drug', 'use', 'more', 'less', 'emphasizing', 'positive', 'traits', 'people', 'who', 'partake', 'liberal', 'culture', 'also', 'depicting', 'what', 'wrong', 'stoning', 'film']",N/A

1046699,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,B000MGUZJ8,Kevin F. Tasker,"[1, 1]","Weird. This movie starts out centering on Luke Wilson and his art-dealings and pot-dealings, not to mention the trials and tribulations of his love life. Then about halfway through, around the time Jack Black's character is introduced, Wilson's character sort of goes away and we are treated to a pretty odd rape scene and lots of general weirdness that has nothing to do with the original story line. This is a pretty daring move, to just give the protagonist a back-seat to other, less story-driven rambling narrative techniques (acid trips and the like). While I found myself enjoying it to a point, I find it very curious indeed. The writers must have been stoooned. Even on the DVD cover, Jack Black takes a prominent place. When the movie begins, it is Luke Wilson's show. Very, very curious. Also Jeremy Sisto seems entirely out-of-place as the gay bf, he is just way way too Wooden and it seems like he is in the wrong movie. Andy Dick is good, as is Wilson. The girls are primarily forgettable and Jack Black chews the scenery, plays some Tenacious D songs and generally derails the ""plot line"" (Which, admittedly, wasn't all that focused to being with). IF you like bizarre stoner humor (not really Wes Anderson, as another reviewer described it) that doesn't quite add up to much and shifts tonally back and forth like an acid-tripping pendulum, then you might find something to like. I thought it was a little long, given the subject matter. Strange, is all I can say.
