729442,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00007JMDI,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","Shirley is really little in this one; maybe three years old? I guess I could go look up her bio if I wanted to. Aside from Shirley, this is an incredibly stupid movie.The basic idea is that the president has appointed a cabinet post called the Secretary of Amusement. But what constituted amusement in 1934 was quite different from anything we could respect today, cute little curly-headed girls notwithstanding. There's a song ""I'm Laughing"" which is sung by a variety of people, ending with Aunt Jemima and a large chorus of darkies. No kidding: she is listed as ""Aunt Jemima"" in the opening credits!One of the scenes in the ""I'm Laughing"" routine has a group of young women who look like they are hanging around a stage door, who refer to ""these round heels"" as they turn their ankles over. I suppose that was OK because the little kids wouldn't know what it meant.George Bernard Shaw is announced to the secretary, and in walks Stepin Fetchit carrying a piece of plywood so he can do his dance routine without harming the carpet. For those of you who have not had the experience of seeing Mr. Fetchit in other movies, he's the one all the later blackface comedians (that is, whites in black makeup) were imitating. His voice was low and hoarse, his speech drawling and exaggerated form of what is now called Ebonics, and he had the most outrageous puns. He was also a very good dancer, and danced with Shirley Temple in quite a few movies.I suppose the idea was it gave a large cast jobs, because there are quite a few song and dance production numbers which must have swelled the payroll. It just seems a shame that the only way black performers could get work was to accept such stereotyped roles.Meanwhile, a conspiracy of industrialists (""We have written contracts on the assumption that the depression would continue for years."") and senators (""He's turning this country into a pack of laughing hyenas."") plot to destroy the Department of Amusement. They are so obvious they are absurd.Two senators agree to go see the Secretary, and while they are waiting for his arrival, they do a weird slapstick and tumbling acrobats act. One says ""You were with me on the Red River Dam project,"" and the other agrees. ""You were with me on the Hoover Dam project,"" and again the other agrees. ""In fact, you've been with me on every dam project.""Most of the musical routines and the comedy routines are as close to entirely pointless as it is possible for them to be. Stepin Fetchit does an incredible scene with a penguin who is dressed up like Jimmie Durante, and talks like him, too. Again, some very clever puns, but mostly a stupid, stupid scene. And it bears absolutely no relationship to the plot.",2,Sugar-Coated Corn,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,2700,"['Shirley', 'really', 'little', 'one', 'maybe', 'three', 'years', 'old', 'guess', 'could', 'go', 'look', 'up', 'bio', 'wanted', 'Aside', 'Shirley', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'movie.The', 'basic', 'idea', 'president', 'appointed', 'cabinet', 'post', 'called', 'Secretary', 'Amusement', 'what', 'constituted', 'amusement', '1934', 'was', 'quite', 'different', 'anything', 'could', 'respect', 'today', 'cute', 'little', 'curly-headed', 'girls', 'notwithstanding', 'song', ""'m"", 'Laughing', 'sung', 'variety', 'people', 'ending', 'Aunt', 'Jemima', 'large', 'chorus', 'darkies', 'kidding', 'listed', 'Aunt', 'Jemima', 'opening', 'credits', 'One', 'scenes', ""'m"", 'Laughing', 'routine', 'group', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'look', 'are', 'hanging', 'stage', 'door', 'who', 'refer', 'round', 'heels', 'turn', 'ankles', 'suppose', 'was', 'OK', 'little', 'kids', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Bernard', 'Shaw', 'announced', 'secretary', 'walks', 'Stepin', 'Fetchit', 'carrying', 'piece', 'plywood', 'can', 'do', 'dance', 'routine', 'harming', 'carpet', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'experience', 'seeing', 'Mr.', 'Fetchit', 'other', 'movies', 'one', 'later', 'blackface', 'comedians', 'whites', 'black', 'makeup', 'were', 'imitating', 'voice', 'was', 'low', 'hoarse', 'speech', 'drawling', 'exaggerated', 'form', 'what', 'now', 'called', 'Ebonics', 'had', 'most', 'outrageous', 'puns', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'dancer', 'danced', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'quite', 'few', 'movies.I', 'suppose', 'idea', 'was', 'gave', 'large', 'cast', 'jobs', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'song', 'dance', 'production', 'numbers', 'must', 'have', 'swelled', 'payroll', 'just', 'shame', 'only', 'way', 'black', 'performers', 'could', 'get', 'work', 'was', 'accept', 'such', 'stereotyped', 'roles.Meanwhile', 'conspiracy', 'industrialists', 'have', 'written', 'contracts', 'assumption', 'depression', 'would', 'continue', 'years', 'senators', 'turning', 'country', 'pack', 'laughing', 'hyenas', 'plot', 'destroy', 'Department', 'Amusement', 'are', 'so', 'obvious', 'are', 'absurd.Two', 'senators', 'agree', 'go', 'see', 'Secretary', 'are', 'waiting', 'arrival', 'do', 'weird', 'slapstick', 'tumbling', 'acrobats', 'act', 'One', 'were', 'Red', 'River', 'Dam', 'project', 'other', 'agrees', 'were', 'Hoover', 'Dam', 'project', 'again', 'other', 'agrees', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dam', 'project', 'Most', 'musical', 'routines', 'comedy', 'routines', 'are', 'close', 'entirely', 'pointless', 'possible', 'be', 'Stepin', 'Fetchit', 'incredible', 'scene', 'penguin', 'who', 'dressed', 'up', 'Jimmie', 'Durante', 'talks', 'too', 'Again', 'very', 'clever', 'puns', 'mostly', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'scene', 'absolutely', 'relationship', 'plot']",N/A

729448,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00007JMDI,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[1, 2]","According to IMDB, Shirley Temple's film career began in 1932.  She appeared in many short films and at least some full length (for that time) films, such as ""Out All Night (1933)"" and ""To the Last Man (1933).""  As 1934 was unfolding Shirley was well on to her way to becoming a movie icon and a cultural phenomenon of the 1930's.  However, before her career was fully launched she appeared in several highly forgettable films, including this propaganda disaster.This movie apparently took some inspiration from Will Rogers, though I failed to see the connection.  Supposedly President Franklin Roosevelt appoints Lawrence Cromwell (Warner Baxter) as the secretary of amusement.  Hah, hah.  That is really funny.  Soon Cromwell is running afoul of various nefarious (a very 1930's word) business types who want the Depression to continue because it is good for business.  I did not make this up.  Apparently someone thought it would be a good idea to blame businessmen for the Depression.  I guess it was easier to blame them than blaming beer-drinking polka players from Wisconsin.Shirley's big part comes when she sings ""Baby, Take a Bow,"" which is actually the best part of the movie.  She appears a couple of more times, but only briefly.  I should have timed how long she was on screen, but from the picture on the package I thought Shirley was going to be in this movie a lot and never thought to add up the seconds she was in the movie.  Okay, I exaggerate; Shirley was in the movie for minutes, maybe even 10 minutes.I admit that I allowed myself to be bamboozled into this movie.  I just wanted to have a collection of Shirley Temple movies and Shirley's role was highlighted on the package.  Remember caveat emptor, let the buyer beware?  I guess I get burned so rarely that I failed to remember caveat emptor.  In fairness to Shirley, the song ""Baby, Take a Bow"" is a sweet little song and Shirley is as cute as can be.  Furthermore, there are fans of many of the actors in this film that may want it for other reasons.  I even understand that this movie was an attempt by Hollywood to try and get people to think more positively about the country.  However, the ending of this movie was just too corny and over-the-top; in other words, pure propaganda.This movie is a must for Shirley Temple completists.  Fans of some of the other actors in this movie will want this movie for their appearances.  Everyone else can move on to the next item on their movie list.Good Luck!",2,Shirley Temple in a Propaganda Film,1166313600,"12 17, 2006",2006,2483,"['According', 'IMDB', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'film', 'career', 'began', '1932', 'appeared', 'many', 'short', 'films', 'least', 'full', 'length', 'time', 'films', 'such', 'Night', '1933', 'Last', 'Man', '1933', '1934', 'was', 'unfolding', 'Shirley', 'was', 'well', 'way', 'becoming', 'movie', 'icon', 'cultural', 'phenomenon', '1930', 'However', 'career', 'was', 'fully', 'launched', 'appeared', 'several', 'highly', 'forgettable', 'films', 'including', 'propaganda', 'movie', 'apparently', 'took', 'inspiration', 'Will', 'Rogers', 'failed', 'see', 'connection', 'Supposedly', 'President', 'Franklin', 'Roosevelt', 'appoints', 'Lawrence', 'Cromwell', 'Warner', 'Baxter', 'secretary', 'amusement', 'Hah', 'hah', 'really', 'funny', 'Soon', 'Cromwell', 'running', 'afoul', 'various', 'nefarious', 'very', '1930', 'word', 'business', 'types', 'who', 'want', 'Depression', 'continue', 'good', 'business', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'Apparently', 'someone', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'blame', 'businessmen', 'Depression', 'guess', 'was', 'easier', 'blame', 'blaming', 'beer-drinking', 'polka', 'players', 'Wisconsin.Shirley', 'big', 'part', 'when', 'Baby', 'Take', 'Bow', 'actually', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'couple', 'more', 'times', 'only', 'briefly', 'should', 'have', 'timed', 'how', 'long', 'was', 'screen', 'picture', 'package', 'thought', 'Shirley', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'movie', 'lot', 'never', 'thought', 'add', 'up', 'seconds', 'was', 'movie', 'Okay', 'exaggerate', 'Shirley', 'was', 'movie', 'minutes', 'maybe', 'even', '10', 'minutes.I', 'admit', 'allowed', 'be', 'bamboozled', 'movie', 'just', 'wanted', 'have', 'collection', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'movies', 'Shirley', 'role', 'was', 'highlighted', 'package', 'Remember', 'caveat', 'emptor', 'let', 'buyer', 'beware', 'guess', 'get', 'burned', 'so', 'rarely', 'failed', 'remember', 'caveat', 'emptor', 'fairness', 'Shirley', 'song', 'Baby', 'Take', 'Bow', 'sweet', 'little', 'song', 'Shirley', 'as', 'cute', 'can', 'be', 'Furthermore', 'are', 'fans', 'many', 'actors', 'film', 'may', 'want', 'other', 'reasons', 'even', 'understand', 'movie', 'was', 'attempt', 'Hollywood', 'try', 'get', 'people', 'think', 'more', 'positively', 'country', 'However', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'corny', 'over-the-top', 'other', 'words', 'pure', 'propaganda.This', 'movie', 'must', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'completists', 'Fans', 'other', 'actors', 'movie', 'will', 'want', 'movie', 'appearances', 'Everyone', 'else', 'can', 'move', 'next', 'item', 'movie', 'list.Good', 'Luck']",N/A

Shirley outshines many of her adult peers in her musical number; she's absolutely adorable and she acts brilliantly especially considering her age! The plot moves along at a relatively good pace and most of the musical numbers are actually rather well done. The plot, however, is razor thin and frankly I thought it was hokey at its best and dumb at its worst.The action begins when the president creates a new position in his cabinet for Secretary of Amusement to help the country forget its woes during the depression. When offered the position, showman Lawrence Cromwell (Warner Baxter) accepts the position and eventually Lawrence becomes romantically involved with his assistant secretary of the children's department, Mary Adams (Madge Evans).But things won't be so easy for Cromwell. Corporate moguls want the country to remain unhappy so that they can make huge profits as always. (Please don't ask me to explain this; it's just ridiculous.) One of the moguls takes Lawrence on a sea voyage to try to bribe him to leave the office and permanently undermine the Department of Amusement. Naturally, Lawrence Cromwell doesn't accept the bribe; he chooses to keep on fighting to help the nation get back on its feet and ""out of the red"" through amusement.Shirley Temple fits in as a young child auditioning for Cromwell; and she gets a job from Cromwell despite the fact that she's a tad too young to officially be awarded the job. Shirley dances wonderfully--now if only she could have had the same genius at the age of seven to write a better plot for the movie the film could actually have gone somewhere! Look for James Dunn to play Jimmy Dugan, Shirley's father. James Dunn gives a great performance himself.Although I've said a lot there's still more. We have the pure delight of watching painfully dated and embarrassing portraits of African American people in the ""Aunt Jemima"" character; and Stepin Fetchit plays what is today considered a very offensive role as a not very smart black man who just happens to be named George Bernard Shaw. Ouch! In fact, major OUCH!If you decide to watch this movie, please just do so for the musical numbers--especially the one with Shirley, the ""hillbilly"" number with the dancing ladies and the strong finale. There's so little plot in the movie it's as if there's no plot at all; this is the first movie in quite a while that had a plot I genuinely considered dumb. It's a shame that Madge Evans, James Dunn and Warner Baxter couldn't be in a better quality film together; but they do act well with what little they are given and Shirley shines like gold!The only DVD extra (besides scene selection) is a trailer for another film that is actually a REAL Shirley Temple film.Enter please--but at your own risk.

729451,A1537KCD6LBWGI,B00007JMDI,steve_manassas,"[0, 0]","This 1934 movie was Shirley Temple's first full-length feature film for Fox Film Corporation, which would later merge with 20th Century Pictures to form 20th Century-Fox.  Unfortunately, it's not one of her better efforts.  The ""Baby, Take A Bow"" production number, where Shirley expertly sings and dances alongside James Dunn, who plays her father, is the highlight of the film, but we don't get much Shirley, except for a few earlier scenes, and a brief appearance in the parade scene at the end.  Fox later recycled the song ""Baby, Take A Bow"" for alater Shirley Temple movie of the same name.  The plot revolves around FDR appointing a Secretary of Amusement (Warner Baxter, of42nd Streetfame) to lift the country out of the Great Depression.  In the film, the strategy worked, as the Depression was over by the film's end, but in real life, the Depression lingered for another seven years, until the U.S. entered World War II, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.Yes, there are stereotypes galore in the film, not only racial (e.g., comedian Stepin Fetchit - real name Lincoln Theodore Monroe Andrew Perry - playing dimwitted butler George Bernard Shaw; actress Tess Gardella, playing ""Aunt Jemima"" in blackface - Gardella was Italian-American), but also regional (rural whites depicted as hillbillies), and the inevitable Hollywood stereotype of greedy businessmen profiteering from other people's misery - is there any other kind portrayed in the movies?For home video release, the film was cut from 80 to 69 minutes (even parts of the end credits are cut off).  Supposedly, the cut footage was racist, and probably was, but it's hard to imagine that it was worse than what was left in the film.  It's important to remember that most Hollywood movies made in the '30s, '40s, '50s, '60s, and '70s, and even some more recent films, had stereotypes of one kind or another.  Even some present-day movies still use stereotypes.If Shirley Temple Black herself requested or agreed to these deletions, then I have no problem with the edits, but if 20th Century-Fox Home Entertainment is doing it to appease the PC police, that is wrong; the entire film, warts and all, needs to be seen.Fortunately, as Shirley's Fox career progressed, her films would get a lot better in quality, and her screen time would be increased.Unlike most of the films in the Shirley Temple DVD series, this film is not colorized.  Bonus features include a trailer forThe Little Princess, which was Shirley's first Technicolor feature, a fake stereo soundtrack, a Spanish-language soundtrack, and subtitles in English and Spanish.  The Spanish subtitles pop up inadvertently during a few scenes in the film, even when they are not turned on.
