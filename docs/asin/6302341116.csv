This scene alone is worth 5 stars.A wonderful heartwarming movie that I hope is soon released on DVD.  It showcases Garland who is brilliant in every respect, right down to commanding an irish brogue better than more irish people.  What a talent!!  My gosh, this girl could do anything!! Probably the most talented individual of the 20th century.The rest of the cast is exceptional as well....Charles Winninger as her cantakerous father/grandfather who holds the picture together with his stubborn Irish pride.  George Murphy who tears your heart out in Judy's death scene...he practically steals the scene away from Judy which is no small feat.  And Douglas McPhail who woos the young Nellie Kelly with great aplomb.  Sadly, McPhail would commit suicide by poisoning himself on December 6, 1944 which was such a waste because he was a talented young man.  Too bad MGM didn't quite know what to do with him.All around, Little Nellie Kelly is pure escapism at its best with a show stopping ""Singin in the Rain"" number by Judy which can do it better than anyone!!  Yes, this film is rated 5 stars from me....it is entertainment at its brightest with Judy Garland in the glory days of her MGM career!

I have seen it many times and since I am a huge Judy Garland fan, it seemed like a good choice for my home film library.While the plot is fairly simple and typical of the formula employed by MGM during the WWII era, it is enjoyable fluff enhanced by a few musical numbers featuring young Judy who had a beautiful voice even early in her career that was augmented by personality, youthful radiance, and talent. The story centers on the youthful escapades of Nellie, a teen who has been raised by her maternal grandfather and her NYC policeman father since her mother died in childbirth. While not as complex as her role in Presenting Lily Mars where she blossoms into a more adult role, Judy as the perpetual ingenue growing up is oddly satisfying, but it is Garland's singing in this one that sealed the deal for me.This film is in decent though not remastered condition.",4,Easy Plot And Judy Sings,1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,890,"['like', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'am', 'huge', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'fan', 'seemed', 'good', 'choice', 'home', 'film', 'plot', 'fairly', 'simple', 'typical', 'formula', 'employed', 'MGM', 'WWII', 'era', 'enjoyable', 'fluff', 'enhanced', 'few', 'musical', 'numbers', 'featuring', 'young', 'Judy', 'who', 'had', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'even', 'early', 'career', 'was', 'augmented', 'personality', 'youthful', 'radiance', 'talent', 'story', 'centers', 'youthful', 'escapades', 'Nellie', 'teen', 'who', 'been', 'raised', 'maternal', 'grandfather', 'NYC', 'policeman', 'father', 'mother', 'died', 'childbirth', 'not', 'as', 'complex', 'role', 'Presenting', 'Lily', 'Mars', 'where', 'more', 'adult', 'role', 'Judy', 'perpetual', 'ingenue', 'growing', 'up', 'oddly', 'satisfying', 'Garland', 'singing', 'one', 'sealed', 'deal', 'me.This', 'film', 'decent', 'not', 'remastered', 'condition']",N/A

308249,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,6302341116,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","I wish I could say I loved this film but the most I can swear to is that I grew to begrudgingly like it by the end (after an extremely rocky start).  Whenever Judy Garland is on screen it's a delight.  Whenever Charles Winninger (playing her miserable malcontent father/grandfather) is front and center it's akin to a dirge of hostility.  Getting past his overbearing character/performance takes far too much work.  It's especially disconcerting because not a few sources claim this is a musical comedy.  Unfortunately, there's far too little music to begin with and it's short on comedy, never mind any whimsy (as declared on the DVD jacket!).  The problem with the story is far too much emphasis is placed on the father/grandfather running roughshod over the lives of his daughter and then his granddaughter.  Just calling him a ne'er-do-well doesn't do him justice.  He is at all times a manipulative, shiftless, tyrant who actively seeks to ruin the lives of two women and the men they fall in love with.  The fact that this lying scheming reprobate continuously gets away with hurting these people is astonishing, especially considering this is supposed to be a musical comedy based on a Broadway hit.  How is any of this funny?  Abuse is never a laughing matter.  To consider that type of destructive behavior amusing is a cause for concern.  But the most any of the other characters will say about him is that he is ""strict, with a bad temper,"" or ""you're a ridiculous old man.""I've changed my mind.  Every time I think about this movie I can't get past that domineering old coot willing to do anything to destroy the happiness of his family just to suit himself.  ""In my home I'm king!""Highlights are Judy singing It's a Great Day for the Irish, A Pretty Girl Milking Her Cow, and a great rendition of Singin' in the Rain.",3,"""You're a big man....but a small hat fits you.""",1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,1830,"['wish', 'could', 'say', 'loved', 'film', 'most', 'can', 'swear', 'grew', 'begrudgingly', 'end', 'extremely', 'rocky', 'start', 'Whenever', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'screen', 'delight', 'Whenever', 'Charles', 'Winninger', 'playing', 'miserable', 'malcontent', 'father/grandfather', 'front', 'center', 'akin', 'dirge', 'hostility', 'Getting', 'overbearing', 'character/performance', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'work', 'especially', 'disconcerting', 'not', 'few', 'sources', 'claim', 'musical', 'comedy', 'Unfortunately', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'music', 'begin', 'short', 'comedy', 'never', 'mind', 'whimsy', 'declared', 'DVD', 'jacket', 'problem', 'story', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'father/grandfather', 'running', 'roughshod', 'lives', 'daughter', 'then', 'granddaughter', 'Just', 'calling', ""ne'er-do-well"", ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'times', 'manipulative', 'shiftless', 'tyrant', 'who', 'actively', 'ruin', 'lives', 'two', 'women', 'men', 'fall', 'love', 'fact', 'lying', 'scheming', 'reprobate', 'continuously', 'away', 'hurting', 'people', 'astonishing', 'especially', 'considering', 'supposed', 'be', 'musical', 'comedy', 'based', 'Broadway', 'hit', 'How', 'funny', 'Abuse', 'never', 'laughing', 'matter', 'consider', 'type', 'destructive', 'behavior', 'amusing', 'cause', 'concern', 'most', 'other', 'characters', 'will', 'say', 'strict', 'bad', 'temper', ""'re"", 'ridiculous', 'old', 'man', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'mind', 'Every', 'time', 'think', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'past', 'domineering', 'old', 'coot', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'destroy', 'happiness', 'family', 'just', 'suit', 'home', ""'m"", 'king', 'Highlights', 'are', 'Judy', 'singing', 'Great', 'Day', 'Irish', 'A', 'Pretty', 'Girl', 'Milking', 'Her', 'Cow', 'great', 'rendition', 'Singin', 'Rain']",N/A
308250,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6302341116,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[21, 23]","Judy Garland was a sensation in THE WIZARD OF OZ and BABES IN ARMS--but by 1940 she was eighteen years old, and LITTLE NELLY KELLY finds her in transition between the child star she was and the adult star she would become.  Based on a George M. Cohan play, the film offers Garland a double role: first as Irish-born Nelly Kelly and later as her teenage daughter, ""Little"" Nelly Kelly.  The storyline is sentimental.  Against father Charles Winninger's wishes, Garland marries George Murphy and leaves Ireland for America--with her stubborn and ill-tempered father in tow.  After becoming an American citizen, she dies in childbirth (Garland's only death scene, and she plays it very well), leaving possessive grandfather and police officer husband to wangle over her surviving child.The first portion of the film is the weakest, with neither Garland nor Murphy entirely at home with their Irish accents; another flaw is the fact that Winninger's irrascable grandfather eventually becomes a shade too obnoxious to fully engage our sympathies and Murphy is none-too-convincing in old-age make-up.  Although not a musical per se, the real highlight of the film are Garland's few songs, which include ""A Pretty Girl Milking Her Cow,"" ""A Great Day for the Irish,"" and an elaborate staging of ""Singin' In The Rain."" Although she still shows traces of the affectations forced upon her in previous films by director Busby Berkley, she performs both her numbers and her scenes with a playfulness and sincerity that is quite charming.Although expertly made, LITTLE NELLY KELLY is essentially an inexpensive programmer designed to test Garland's potential as an adult actress--a test which she clearly passes.  But the film is so greatly overshadowed by both her earlier and later achievements that it is negligable in both her cannon and the musical genre as a whole, and as such will be of interests more to Garland completists than to casual viewers.

She was just 18 years old when she starred as a Young Irish beauty who falls in love with George Murphy, marries and dies in Child Birth. Then Garland plays her own 16 year old daughter Little Nellie and she did it brilliantly. One of the most lavish numbers in this film is ""Nellie Kelly I Love You"". Garland sings ""Singin' In The Rain"" just 12 years before Gene Kelly and her version is dynamite. As Wife Nellie She gets her first kiss and as child Nellie struggles to understand why her father (Murphy) and Grandfather (Charles Winninger) don't get along. This film proves that Dorothy was capable of enchanting an audinence as an adult movie Actress.If you have only seen one film of Judy Garland then you have to see this one.

308253,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6302341116,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[9, 10]","Judy Garland worked very hard to play both mother Nellie Kelly and daughter Little Nellie Kelly in this movie-and it shows! Her performance is both flawless and a treat for Garland fans. She dances, acts and sings very well. (Look for a brief ""Singing in the Rain"" by Garland toward the end of the picture; this movie was adapted from a play by George M. Cohan.) I honestly don't understand why the movie is out of print and not yet on DVD!This movie has the only death scene Garland ever performed in the movies. A tearjerker! The mother Nellie Kelly dies just after giving birth to her daughter.The movie tells the story of the Kelly family beginning in Ireland circa 1900. Nellie has fallen in love with her beau and they marry much to the chagrin of Nellie's stubborn father played by Charles Winninger. (His acting is extremely convincing, too.) They travel to America and the story continues with a fine view of the Irish immigrant experience.  The Saint Patrick's Day parade scene positively shines!There is also a good deal of time spent fleshing out the relationships between the members of this small family. The father of the first Nellie fights stubbornly with his son-in-law through the years. (He doesn't mind mooching off them, however, with never a thank you whatsoever.)Overall, I recommend this movie for any Garland fan as well as fans of the M-G-M musicals.
