When I ran across these additional Kettle movies I wanted them to complete my collection. But in these two movies Percy Kilbride, the original Pa Kettle is absent and the children are different. The producers attempted to work around Pa being absent and the original children aging out, but the movies just don't have the same chemistry as before. I will keep the movies, but they aren't the best of the Kettle series.",3,Somewhat disappointing,1373673600,"07 13, 2013",2013,507,"['am', 'fan', 'Kettle', 'movies', 'own', 'first', 'eight', 'movies', 'released', 'earlier', 'DVDs', 'When', 'ran', 'additional', 'Kettle', 'movies', 'wanted', 'complete', 'collection', 'two', 'movies', 'Percy', 'Kilbride', 'original', 'Pa', 'Kettle', 'absent', 'children', 'are', 'different', 'producers', 'attempted', 'work', 'around', 'Pa', 'being', 'absent', 'original', 'children', 'aging', 'out', 'movies', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'chemistry', 'will', 'keep', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'best', 'Kettle', 'series']",Further Adventures of the Kettles Collection
