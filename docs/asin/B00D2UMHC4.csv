1653146,A358ZJXCISVIU0,B00D2UMHC4,Claire,"[3, 5]","I really enjoyed the two workouts on this DVD. Note: you will need ankle weights, dumbbells, and a chair for the first workout and just dumbbells and a chair for the second workout. I have done the second workout more simply because it requires less equipment. The first workout is more aerobic with some toning. She does some dance moves slowly but with ankle weight and hand weight to keep the intensity up. I really like this because I just couldn't do any of her dance DVDs. It helps you learn some of her signature moves while still workout at an intermediate level. The second workout is just toning. She does a brief warmup and then onto about 8-9 minutes of arms which I like because it really works the arms from all angles. Then she does about 5 moves for lower body using the chair, 20 reps on each side. I like that we're not doing endless reps but it's still an effective workout. She does talk for a fair amount between moves, but I just keep doing the reps while she talks. Then she ends with a brief standing abs section and stretch. I wish she had done more ab moves and less talking. Overall, I think it's a great introduction to her method as the same moves (with varying intensity) will be on her more intermediate/advanced DVD's.",5,Great introduction to the Tracy Anderson Method and a great intermediate workout.,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,1250,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'two', 'workouts', 'DVD', 'Note', 'will', 'need', 'ankle', 'weights', 'dumbbells', 'chair', 'first', 'workout', 'just', 'dumbbells', 'chair', 'second', 'workout', 'have', 'done', 'second', 'workout', 'more', 'simply', 'less', 'equipment', 'first', 'workout', 'more', 'aerobic', 'toning', 'dance', 'moves', 'slowly', 'ankle', 'weight', 'hand', 'weight', 'keep', 'intensity', 'up', 'really', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'learn', 'signature', 'moves', 'still', 'workout', 'intermediate', 'level', 'second', 'workout', 'just', 'toning', 'brief', 'warmup', 'then', 'onto', '8-9', 'minutes', 'arms', 'like', 'really', 'arms', 'angles', 'Then', '5', 'moves', 'lower', 'body', 'using', 'chair', '20', 'reps', 'side', 'like', ""'re"", 'not', 'doing', 'endless', 'reps', 'still', 'effective', 'workout', 'talk', 'fair', 'amount', 'moves', 'just', 'keep', 'doing', 'reps', 'talks', 'Then', 'brief', 'standing', 'abs', 'section', 'stretch', 'wish', 'had', 'done', 'more', 'ab', 'moves', 'less', 'talking', 'Overall', 'think', 'great', 'introduction', 'method', 'same', 'moves', 'varying', 'intensity', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'intermediate/advanced', 'DVD']",Tracy Anderson: The Method For Beginners

1653149,A2EIEFWC5RRFH7,B00D2UMHC4,NotThatGirl,"[72, 89]","I am not new to Tracy Anderson and her Method and have actually been doing her workouts off and on since I purchased her original Mat dvd in 2009. I own almost every single dvd and program she has put out (Perfect Design, Metamorphosis, rebounder workouts, etc.) and I am still really pleased that I picked this up. Tracy comes across as very sincere and genuine as she guides you through the moves and explains her unique Method. She counts out reps evenly and explains how to get the most out of her workout, encouraging you to keep at it until you can do the same amount of reps or improve your range of motion. There are two 30 minute routines; the first one is a combination of toning and some beginner dance cardio work and the second is all toning. I have always had difficulty with her dance cardio and in this dvd she really breaks it down into something more manageable (much better than the Perfect Design series Beginner Cardio in terms of instruction). I do believe with practice that I might actually be able to do it someday. This is really the place to start if you are new to Tracy Anderson and her workout. Even if you aren't I think there is value in this dvd. I was worried the difficulty level for me would be too easy and while I am definitely not a beginner in terms of working out or Tracy's Method, it really helped me understand where I should be feeling a move. She is very sweet and does an excellent job with introducing her Method. I highly recommend this dvd and I am looking forward to her release of Precision Toning later this year as well!",5,Great Introduction to the Tracy Anderson Method!,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,1574,"['am', 'not', 'new', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'Method', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'doing', 'workouts', 'off', 'purchased', 'original', 'Mat', 'dvd', '2009', 'own', 'almost', 'single', 'dvd', 'program', 'put', 'out', 'Perfect', 'Design', 'Metamorphosis', 'rebounder', 'workouts', 'etc', 'am', 'still', 'really', 'pleased', 'picked', 'up', 'Tracy', 'very', 'sincere', 'genuine', 'moves', 'unique', 'Method', 'out', 'reps', 'evenly', 'how', 'get', 'most', 'workout', 'encouraging', 'keep', 'can', 'do', 'same', 'amount', 'reps', 'improve', 'range', 'motion', 'are', 'two', '30', 'minute', 'routines', 'first', 'one', 'combination', 'toning', 'beginner', 'dance', 'cardio', 'work', 'second', 'toning', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'difficulty', 'dance', 'cardio', 'dvd', 'really', 'down', 'something', 'more', 'manageable', 'much', 'better', 'Perfect', 'Design', 'series', 'Beginner', 'Cardio', 'terms', 'instruction', 'do', 'believe', 'practice', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'someday', 'really', 'place', 'start', 'are', 'new', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'workout', 'Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'think', 'value', 'dvd', 'was', 'worried', 'difficulty', 'level', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'easy', 'am', 'definitely', 'not', 'beginner', 'terms', 'working', 'out', 'Tracy', 'Method', 'really', 'helped', 'understand', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'feeling', 'move', 'very', 'sweet', 'excellent', 'job', 'introducing', 'Method', 'highly', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'release', 'Precision', 'Toning', 'later', 'year', 'as', 'well']",Tracy Anderson: The Method For Beginners
1653150,A23LYK2N6DNIW7,B00D2UMHC4,P. Kalafarski,"[12, 18]","I have to really carve time out of my day to work out, and if I've only got a half hour, I need for it to count.  I'm mad that I wasted time doing this workout - and really, it doesn't deserve to be called that, I hardly worked.  I did the first 1/2 hour of this DVD, and she did so much talking, I probably only moved half of that time.  And what I did was so basic, so easy I was not challenged in the least.  I think I would not have minded so much if at least she worked us the whole time, even if the moves were simple, but there was way too much pausing and her listening to herself talk.  If you're going to play this DVD over and over, as most of us do with our exercise DVDs, the explanations she gives become nothing more than time wasters.  She should have done an instructional piece at the beginning, if she felt she needed to give so much information and demonstration.  If you're looking for the most basic of places to start an exercise routine, I suppose you could give this a try, but you'll have outgrown it in just a few views.

She explains all the moves in the DVD very well so you really understand what parts of the body you are working and what you should feel as you do each exercises. Yes, she talks quite a bit in the DVD and there are a few cases where there is downtime as you are setting up the next exercise.

Her other videos are difficult for people who aren't already at least somewhat fit.  I like that she goes over the details of the movements in this one.  There are 2 workouts on the dvd- each 30 minutes long.  I personally prefer workout #2 on the dvd because there's less leg/but work and more arm/ab work.  My butt and thighs have a tendancy to get quite bulky after a few weeks of any fitness routine so I try to not do so much strengthening of those areas.  Tracy claims that her movements won't cause bulk and I hope that's true, but I still keep the butt and thigh work to a minimum so I tend to skip the first workout and go to the second.She uses 2 dumbells and suggests they be between 1-3 lbs. She also uses wrist and ankle weights.  I just use my 1 lb wrist weights for anything she requires weights with.
