1611486,A2WRR3S3J6JLX4,B00AIBZLHS,,"[0, 2]","A white, well to do, French couple, now in their 80's confronts the final chapter of life in their lavish Paris flat. I am told they love each other terribly. But I am not shown that. Routine has taken ahold. The aging process has been registered by both of them. Each submitting to it in their own ways. Cherished piano teachers by profession, having delivered the next generation of performing stars, we witness her in flashbacks, emanating rigid coldness. Rather than being a study of old age and mortality, therefore, Amour is a portrait of sheltered privilege being pulled out of its impermanent shell and confronted with bodily break down, the ultimate imperfection. Unacceptable to both, the inevitable end of life is undermined by a final act of defiance.Love might exist between them, though it could be just as well residual co-dependence. Love is not what makes their post middle aged daughter show her face a few times. There is concern on her part, that fades a bit too quickly, whenever the words money or house are uttered by her dying mother. A grandson exists, we are told. But love does not motivate him to appear once either. Committed, therefore, predominantly to each other, I lacked to notice loving interactions, or past traces of it. Devoted, loving couples, sadly can witness each others break down and die at any age. That is not what this film is about, in my opinion.Haneke reverses statistics, by letting him survive her. It had to be that way, for having her kill him and then ending her life could have seemed implausible. This is not a film tackling euthanasia either. Love is many things. Perfectionism is certainly not one of them.  Having witnessed each other for most of their lives, the final chapter, the one where all facades come to an end, is not appreciated. Mirroring such decay horrifies these two perfectionists. Perhaps he had to end her suffering, or perhaps he simply could not endure having her foreshadow what might lie in store in his near future. Ending both their lives before total failure sets in, therefore, poses as last attempt to preserve access to privileges of power and control these two perfectionists seemingly have enjoyed all their lives.Haneke gave The White Ribbon that title to point to cruelty and hypocrisy. Perhaps, naming it Amour, should be understood in that same vein.",4,death and perfectionism,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,2344,"['white', 'well', 'do', 'French', 'couple', 'now', '80', 'confronts', 'final', 'chapter', 'life', 'lavish', 'Paris', 'flat', 'am', 'told', 'love', 'other', 'terribly', 'am', 'not', 'shown', 'Routine', 'taken', 'ahold', 'aging', 'process', 'been', 'registered', 'submitting', 'own', 'ways', 'Cherished', 'piano', 'teachers', 'profession', 'having', 'delivered', 'next', 'generation', 'performing', 'stars', 'witness', 'flashbacks', 'emanating', 'rigid', 'coldness', 'Rather', 'being', 'study', 'old', 'age', 'mortality', 'therefore', 'Amour', 'portrait', 'sheltered', 'privilege', 'being', 'pulled', 'impermanent', 'shell', 'confronted', 'bodily', 'break', 'down', 'ultimate', 'imperfection', 'Unacceptable', 'inevitable', 'end', 'life', 'undermined', 'final', 'act', 'defiance.Love', 'might', 'exist', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'residual', 'co-dependence', 'Love', 'not', 'what', 'post', 'middle', 'aged', 'daughter', 'show', 'face', 'few', 'times', 'concern', 'part', 'bit', 'too', 'quickly', 'whenever', 'words', 'money', 'house', 'are', 'uttered', 'dying', 'mother', 'grandson', 'are', 'told', 'love', 'not', 'motivate', 'appear', 'once', 'either', 'Committed', 'therefore', 'predominantly', 'other', 'lacked', 'notice', 'loving', 'interactions', 'past', 'traces', 'Devoted', 'loving', 'couples', 'sadly', 'can', 'witness', 'others', 'break', 'down', 'die', 'age', 'not', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'opinion.Haneke', 'statistics', 'letting', 'survive', 'had', 'be', 'way', 'having', 'kill', 'then', 'ending', 'life', 'could', 'have', 'seemed', 'implausible', 'not', 'film', 'tackling', 'euthanasia', 'Love', 'many', 'things', 'Perfectionism', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'Having', 'witnessed', 'other', 'most', 'lives', 'final', 'chapter', 'one', 'where', 'come', 'end', 'not', 'appreciated', 'Mirroring', 'such', 'decay', 'horrifies', 'two', 'perfectionists', 'Perhaps', 'had', 'end', 'suffering', 'perhaps', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'endure', 'having', 'foreshadow', 'what', 'might', 'lie', 'store', 'near', 'future', 'Ending', 'lives', 'total', 'failure', 'sets', 'therefore', 'last', 'attempt', 'preserve', 'access', 'privileges', 'power', 'control', 'two', 'perfectionists', 'seemingly', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'lives.Haneke', 'gave', 'White', 'Ribbon', 'point', 'cruelty', 'hypocrisy', 'Perhaps', 'naming', 'Amour', 'should', 'be', 'understood', 'same', 'vein']",N/A

FInally I made some strong coffee and put it on, just to be able to return it to Netflix and get something better.  The acting is wonderful but that's the only good thing about it. The concept, I suppose, is to show the true &#34;amour&#34; of an elderly man who takes care of his wife after she's had a series of strokes.  However there is nothing to make this a good film...there is no arc of action, no characters change or grow...there is only unrelieved, tedious, depressing misery;  I've seen old people get sick and die and they did it with true love...which raised the process out of horror into something beautiful.  This is not realistic, not inspiring, and certainly not entertaining.  I finally figured out a tolerable way to finish it...by pushing the fast forward button.

1611492,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B00AIBZLHS,,"[2, 4]","CAUTION: THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEWAlthough I am only 65 years old, most of the people I was close to as a child have died in the past four years, including my closest first cousin (only a month older than me), both of my parents, and my mother's two sisters, who were like auxiliary mothers. We were a very close extended family, all living within two miles of each other until I left home at 18. With the exception of my father, all of those people died in much the same way as Anne did in this movie, but in a much more nightmarish setting, in hospitals and hospices rather than at home, and with an extra kick of morphine at the end instead of a pillow.But dying for all of them was ugly, protracted and humiliating, no less awful than it was for Anne... and FAR more expensive. The worst was my mother, who had Alzheimer's for 21 years before she died and went through for all those years what Anne went through in the few weeks or months this movie covers (note that the season doesn't change). If my father and others had not spoon-fed her (exactly as Georges did with Anne) every meal every day for the last fifteen years of her life, she would have died much sooner and much more humanely.The effect of all that horror on me was to make me determined that I was NOT going to end my life that way. I'll spare you some of the tiresome details and just say that I did everything I could to prevent it, including a health care proxy, a living will, a very restrictive MOLST form (a wonderful, sort of expanded ""Do Not Resuscitate"" form available to New York State residents - a legal document which specifies what kinds of treatment medical professionals are legally allowed to give me) and making clear to my remaining relatives and friends that I did not want to be resuscitated or ever receive any kind of life-extending treatment, but be allowed to die as quickly and as naturally as possible.I got DNR bracelets, lanyard things so I can wear my MOLST around my neck 24 hours, in case I collapse in a supermarket or somewhere, and a bunch of other crap. I got pretty paranoid about being kept alive after my body wears out, which is the norm in today's world. I've had a wonderful life, but I have no desire at all to extend it. Sixty-five years is plenty.Despite all my efforts to ward off the kind of death I saw around me and later in this movie, I never could relax and quit fretting about it. I was just sure something would get screwed up and I'd end up just like all the rest, lying mindless and helpless in diapers in some motorized bed with tubes stuck in me everywhere and people all around trying to keep me alive until they got tired of it and upped the morphine. What this marvelous movie did is take away that anxiety. I don't know how, exactly, but it did it.After seeing what happened to Anne in this movie, and through that remembering in a different way what it was like for my relatives, I realized that I'm okay with it now. It's okay now if I DO end up like that - because, even if it lasts for decades as it did with Mama, eventually it'll be over, and that's all that really matters.If it takes me ten seconds to die or twenty years to die, I'll still die, and nothing can prevent it. That is profoundly comforting to me, and it allows me to scrap the MOLST and all the other voodoo fetishes I had gathered around me and relax. I have no idea how watching this movie gave me this totally unexpected freedom, but I have no doubt that it did.--------This review originated as a post on the IMDb message board for this movie, in a thread titled ""Do elderly people like this movie?""

1611494,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00AIBZLHS,,"[2, 6]","This is a small production out of France, written and directed by bleak-focused filmmaker Michael Haneke.  Both he and his movie along with 85 year old Emmanuelle Riva are all up for Oscars.  I suspect the film has a good chance at Best Foreign Film but little else.The story and the filming is pretty straight forward.  Anne (Riva) and her husband Georges played by another octogenarian, Jean-Louis Trintignant, are retired musicians and teachers living out their years in an apartment in Paris.  After Anne suffers a stroke, she is sent home after a brief hospitalization.  Paralyzed on her right side and confined to a wheelchair, Georges promises her not to institutionalize her again.Haneke puts the audience through the despair, pain and suffering that the couple must endure.  And he does it in great detail, taking his time with the camera focused on simple tasks like feeding, drinking and normally routine habits.  While he clearly wants to impact the viewer of the consequences of aging, it becomes almost intolerable and frankly unnecessary.  When Anne suffers a second stroke, she becomes helpless and uncommunicative.Riva's performance is especially gut-wrenching.  Other notable performances this year including Naomi Watts in ""The Impossible"" and John Hawkes in ""The Sessions"" focus on characters bedridden for most of the film.  Add Riva to the list.  The film has no soundtrack to speak of, relying on the solemn events in front of us.  The only other significant character introduced is the couple's 40-something daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert).While busy with her own life (also a musician) and marital difficulties, Eva's efforts to put Anne back in the hospital are rebuked by Georges, recalling his promise.  The film's conclusion is startling but perhaps not unexpected.

1611497,A256QKS1DIQ54U,B00AIBZLHS,,"[3, 7]","If you're into slow, depressing, foreign dramas that are sure to repel the masses, then `Amour' is the film for you. 2012&#8242;s token French Best Picture nominee of the year, `Amour' is one of those types film's that you can always guarantee will be sure to win the favor of the Academy, at the very least garnering a nomination for major awards if not winning everything (`Amour' won Best Foreign Film and also received Oscar nominations for Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Original Screenplay). `Amour' is depressing, grounded, plainly shot, foreign, French, and a drama centered around a major character's flaw that isn't his or her fault, so naturally it's almost everything the Academy loves. If only it had also been about Jews during the Holocaust, then it would have been sure to have won every award for which it was nominated. I guess having another French drama win Best Picture, Director, and Actor the year before (`The Artist' [2011]) didn't help variety's sake, so ""unfortunately"" for the this movie's sake, it didn't win that much. But it gone a lot of big nominations, including those in categories for which a lot more deserving films (such as `Zero Dark Thirty [2012]) got snubbed, so I don't feel too sorry for it.On to the actual movie, though.`Amour' is, to it's credit, an easily relatable movie with easily relatable (if not necessarily likable) characters due to its very plain style. Almost the entire movie takes place in the one apartment where Emmanuelle Riva's and Jean-Louis Trintignant's characters live as retired married piano teachers. The main conflict centers around the physical malady that affects Riva's character, in which she suffers a stroke that rapidly renders her body partially paralyzed and begins to degenerate her life and that of her husband's into depressing decay. The best part of the film is the interwoven relationships between Riva, Trintignant, and their daughter (played by Isabelle Hupert), which plays out almost too realistically, so much so that you feel the physical stress of all the parties involved, from Riva's growing frustration with her handicaps and Trintignant's spiraling sanity and suffering in silence to Hupert's most visibly noticeable distraught behavior. As Riva's situation worsens and everybody's morale takes a deeper hit, everyone responds in their unique, realistic ways that mirror their established personalities. Riva takes out her frustrations by ramming her electric wheelchair into the wall and by bawling while being scrubbed by an at-home nurse, Hupert cries, yells, and hurls accusations as she believes that her father is not doing what she feels is best for her mother, and Trintignant's behavior is the most haunting of all because he is the most silent, reserved, and catatonic. Throughout most of the film, he neither shows remorse nor anger as he feels the increasing weight of responsibility of his wife's care and their increasingly depressing lifestyle burden him more and more. You can tell that he cares, but he suffers quietly and behind a false mask of strength in an order to preserve morale for his wife. Eventually though, the constant wave of suffering on both his wife and himself takes a permanent tole on him that renders him almost as lifeless and robotic as his wife. The transformation is quite disturbing.With that said, a large part of my problem with this film is the way much the aforementioned content is filmed and presented. Most of the effectiveness of the above material is limited because it rests solely on the actors, who admittedly do a great job, but writer-director Michael Haneke does little to help them out. Put simply, almost every scene is a bore while also being infinitely depressing. Being depressing and not a ""fun"" movie to watch in and of itself is not a mark against `Amour,' but the vanilla style of cinematography and general lack of excitement is. The scenery is the same for the entire 127 minutes, which is fine, but the camerawork is so bland and uninteresting that the film becomes tiresome by the halfway mark. Aside from one rather creepy dream sequence, the movie's staging, blocking, and style of shooting is totally colorless and lacks any emotion. This is as good a time as any to point out that direction can go almost as far as script writing can to determine how well a certain type of story is told. The idea behind `Amour' is admirable, but the way it is filmed robs it of a lot of its power and excitement. Pacing problems ensue throughout much of the story as a result.In the end, I guess that I am just glad that `Amour' didn't win anything beyond the essentially meaningless Best Foreign Language Oscar, despite its good characterizations, because it just wasn't a great film in any respects. It's certainly effective enough and sports memorable performances, especially from its two leads, but nothing here warranted the attention it received, aside from the aforementioned characteristics of being depressing, French, and a drama about an innocent character flaw. Whatever, Academy, at least your annoying trends are more bearable than simply awarding films based on their popularity, like the Grammy's. Being a weird, super-selective sorority is preferable to a straight popularity contest, I suppose.-------------------------------------------------------------------------SCORE: 7/10+ `Amour's diverse characterizations make it an effective and memorable piece of film-making, for the most part.+ Trintignant and Riva put on excellent performances.- The direction and camerawork is hopelessly dull. The pacing also could use some work.? I wonder what depressing drama will get a bunch of nominations next year? Will they have cancer? Alzheimer's?

1611500,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00AIBZLHS,,"[5, 8]","Michael Haneke's ""Amour"" may be the best film ever made about the ravages of old age. But for anyone who has ever lost a loved one to them, it is extremely painful to watch.The film is simple in structure, yet superbly nuanced. Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva play Georges and Anne, a couple in their eighties, both retired piano teachers. One evening they go to hear one of Anne's former students in concert, then go backstage to congratulate him. The next morning they are having breakfast in their comfortable old Paris apartment when Anne suddenly becomes unresponsive and stares blankly into space. From there, the inexorable horrors begin: an unsuccessful operation to unblock Anne's carotid artery, followed by advancing paralysis and dementia. Georges cares for Anne tenderly in their apartment, helped by nurses of varying competence. Eva (Isabelle Huppert), Anne and Georges' middle-aged daughter, fights with Georges about what constitutes the best care for Anne. Then one day, after Georges returns from the funeral of a friend, Anne looks sharply at him and says, ""I can't go on like this.""""Amour"" is unflinchingly honest about the suffering of Anne and Georges, and all the more moving for that. Trintignant and Riva, two of the greatest actors to come out of France's ""Nouvelle Vague"" movement of the 1960s, give performances that may fairly be described as flawless. The opening scene--which I will not reveal--telegraphs an ending that some may find too bitter, some too sentimental, and some just right. ""Amour"" won the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, and is one of the relatively rare Palme d'Or winners that unequivocally deserved the prize.

1611502,A2NI9BFPKAFAZ0,B00AIBZLHS,,"[7, 60]","Why you shouldn't see it:The obvious reason that jumps out at you is that Amour is a foreign language film, leading you to (unless you know French) read your movie. I'll take this opportunity to go off on a tangent addressing that very point. It's not that foreign languages bother me in and of themselves, or that I consider reading to be all that laborious. The problem that I frequently run into is that I am a slow reader. Accordingly, if I'm watching a movie with subtitles, I find myself spending too much time reading and not enough time taking in things like, oh, say, the movie that the dialog is really just supposed to supplement.The story revolves around a very old French couple who live in an apartment in Paris. Through the course of the movie, you meet, to the best of my memory, three other characters, but each of them are little more than afterthoughts. And the plot advances entirely within the confines of the aforementioned apartment. So if watching two old people do nothing all in one place for two hours sounds to you like a boring affair, watching this most likely won't do anything to dispel you of that opinion.Aside from all of the set pieces being tailor made for absolutely nothing happening, the way that the film was made also plays a large part in making the viewer feel little to no excitement. I'm sure you're familiar with the kinetic style in which movies these days are edited, creating fast pacing by cutting quickly from one shot to the next. Well that doesn't happen here. Shots go on for minutes at a time, unbroken and unchanged. Just two old people looking at each other. Or not looking at each other. I don't remember where they were looking, because I was too busy reading. Another element that creates a sort of dead atmosphere is the lack of a soundtrack. All of the sound in this movie comes in the form of foreign language speaking and - very occasional - piano music that the characters listen to.I don't know if it's standard for people to act like these do once they get old, but everything on screen came off to me as stilted and formal. All of the dialog strikes me as very appropriate when speaking with strangers, which is strange, because almost all of the dialog is exchanged between a husband and wife, their daughter, and a former prized pupil. It's possible that the French just didn't translate well into English, leading me to think that there's an emotionless disconnect that isn't actually there. But then that wouldn't explain why everyone also acts (in their tone and manner) appropriately cold and distant, unless there is also a mistranslation between how French people and American people act. Regardless, when two people were interacting with each other, I couldn't tell whether they were complete strangers or dear relatives.Why you should see it:.........I'm honestly having a real hard time with this part. See, I know that (REVIEW SPOILER!!!) at the end I'm going to recommend that people not watch this movie, and then I have to give exceptions to that recommendation afterward. But I'm afraid that if I say anything positive about it here, I won't have any material left for the bullet points.I'm staring, right this moment, at a couple of ratings for Amour. IMDB has it at an 8.0, while Metacritic has it at a 94.I'm speechless.I won't say that I always agree with every assessment of a movie. I know full well that I like some movies that other people don't, and vice versa. But there is a pretty big difference between agreeing with something and understanding it. I don't agree that Angelina Jolie is all that pretty or the earth is flat, but I understand why someone might think so. Here is an instance where I literally go cross-eyed whenever someone mentions how ""good"" or ""brilliant"" or ""watchable"" this film is.In Short:Amour couldn't be a much less exciting movie. If you are looking for something to keep you entertained, interested, or even awake, look elsewhere. To be perfectly honest, the only thing that really captured my imagination was the concept that there were sufficient people in the Academy who considered this their favorite film of the year. I guess I could, somehow, understand a rather morbid individual possibly appreciating this film, but to declare it their favorite would seemingly require an exceptionally special person. Apparently I'm wrong though, and people do like it. I don't know what to tell you. Regardless, I will happily give this movie a 3 out of 10 and suggest that everyone remember there are no ways for them to get these 2 hours of their lives back.Exceptions to the recommendation:- people who like word association puzzles... For instance, what does the film's title (Amour, which is French for ""love"") have to do with its plot? What in the hell is the filmmaker trying to say about love? Is this a French thing? I thought French people were supposed to be romantic and all that, not the exact opposite and depressing. A far more appropriate title to my mind would have been Mis&egrave;re, but I guess that's why I'm not a filmmaker;- people who are eagerly anticipating experiencing a stroke of their very own (or of a loved one);- if you prefer your movies presented to you in book form. Remember earlier when I complained about having to read movies, because it prevents me from watching the movie itself? Luckily that doesn't apply here, because so little happens on the screen anyway;- if you have a strange curiosity to see things that you have been explicitly warned against;- if you actually derive enjoyment out of watching old people live miserable lives;- if this is just sadly one of those few occasions where your bucket list item of seeing every best picture nominee ever will come back to kick you in the posterior.",1,Enormous Age Disconnect?

And, with this French film, you will experience the uneasiness and anguish to watch a man lose his beloved wife.  This is not about the hospital and other illness one  experiences at this stage of life.  It is about the love, emotion, feeling, exasperation of caring and watching your love one fade away, to succumb deeper to that eternal place, that one deems better.Georges and Anne, in their 80s are retired music teachers.  The movie starts out slow, and one might believe it is too slow-paced.  But, have patience, it takes a while for the substance and emotion to seep through.  You see the sign of despair, as Georges notices Anne has changed as the behavior results from two strokes.  Then, she is in a wheelchair.Acting is superb by characters Georges, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Anne, Emmanuelle Riva.  You don't see them in a role, you see the human side of pain both are experiencing.  Georges' pain and confusion is so visible in the eyes.  While Emmanuelle Riva is superb as the bedridden dying woman.  It is no wonder this film won Best Foreign Film Language Film  in 2012.There is a wonderful Making of Amour on the DVD.

1611506,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B00AIBZLHS,Allan M. Lees,"[0, 0]","Some people watch movies to escape from real life. Some watch in order to live vicariously. Some people want movies to confirm their ideas about love, good triumphing over evil, and all the rest of the clich&eacute;s we're subjected to when we're children.And some people watch movies because they appreciate, even though it is a rare thing, a tale told truthfully without varnish, deception, or avoidance.Amour falls squarely into the latter category of marvels. Other reviewers have summarized the plot. It is enough to say that this is a deeply engrossing movie precisely because it deals with something we all must face eventually: our final moments. People always hope they will die ""a good death"" - the Hollywood fantasy of a painless exit surrounded by one's family and friends, with suitable theme music playing in the background and a magical fairyland waiting in the sky as the credits roll. In reality most people die in hospital beds, alone and afraid and confused, with tubes sticking into them and bedsores festering and indifferent exhausted nurses passing heedless as a desperate effort is made to inhale one very last breath...Amour unflinchingly observes the complexities of the end of life. There's no Hollywood pap about ""triumphing over adversity"" or making light of infirmity by turning it into a character tic. This is a deeply moving, painful, and utterly true account of one particular couple's way of dealing with the awful inexorable truth of the descent into nothingness and how horrible it is.You won't be uplifted by this movie. The makers of this film weren't anxious about focus group feedback, ensuring sufficient feel-good moments, and a ""cathartic but uplifting"" end. Instead they made a real, honest, and true account of the end of life. It's absolutely marvelous. The acting is superb, the direction restrained and poised, and everything is under-stated. If you enjoyed movies like House of Sand and Fog or Das Leben der Anderen, you'll appreciate this wonderful offering.

1611508,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00AIBZLHS,Anthony L.,"[3, 3]","Michael Haneke, director of the polarizing but Palm D'Or winningThe White Ribbonand the disturbing and psychologicalFunny Games, and now, the poignant drama Amour, is not a director who slaves to the masses. He does not compromise, he does not water down his weighty subjects, and he will not make an easy film for the sake of being easy.Amour, like most of his films, is slow-moving, bleak, and difficult to watch. It has subtitles, no Hollywood actors, no action, and no humor. And, like most of Haneke's films, it is brilliant, thought-provoking, and expertly shot and acted. I saw this film, and instantly I was taken by it. I thought it was the finest film of 2012 (I still do, bar, surprisingly, The Hobbit. Sorry, I am a Tolkien fan. I cannot lie!). I recommended it to several people. And all of them hated it.Let us ask ourselves why:They said it was boring and slow. They said it was depressing. They said it had no point. They said it had an anti-life message.Respectfully, they all missed the point.Is Amour slow? Yes, it is. It is not fast paced, but instead takes a much calmer, uninvolved look at the life of Georges and Anne. However, I have a surefire remedy for slow movies. Watch the slowest, most contemplative and cerebral movie you know; for me it was Solaris. Every movie after that will seem as fast-paced as a thriller. As for boring, not for me it wasn't, but you have to be in the right mood when you watch the film.Is Amour depressing? To some, yes. Amour is all too chillingly realistic, and to someone who has seen a loved-one sink into mental decline, this film can be painful and sad. However, I saw beautiful scenes of hope mixed with the sadness. I won't spoil it for you, but the ending was both tragic, heart-breaking, shocking, and perhaps even beautiful (I speak of course, of what happened AFTER the climax).Does Amour have no point? I beg to differ. It is a film about old age, loss, hope, and above all, true, undying love. In the words of critic Roger Ebert, it ""has a lesson for us that only the cinema can teach.""And most of all, many people who have seen this film have commented on the ending, which to me hit like a ton of bricks out of the sky. It was devastating, disturbing, and shocking. Many claimed it was anti-life, and promoted euthanasia. Who knows? I did not think it so. In fact, Georges act might be the bravest, most loving thing he could have done for Anne. Then again, it might not have been. Amour sparks endless discussion, but this is a review, not a debate (Why not talk it over in the comments with me?)!One thing is certain: Amour is NOT an easy film to watch. It is, in the words of critic Roger Ebert, a film ""not for sissies"". Amour can be terribly sad and depressing, and at other times slow and difficult. Many will not see the point of the film. I _totally_ understand that point of view, as it is very legitimate and relevant.Let's briefly talk about the acting. It was ab-so-lu-tely perfect. And this is something that even the film's detractors pointed out to me. Trintignant and Riva act in very difficult, weighty, realistic roles, and both do flawlessly. There is something almost sad in their very composure; Riva was a stunning French beauty in her day (Hiroshima Mon Amour (1959)) and Trintignant was a dashing young man in his (My Night At Maud's). Now they are old and wrinkled, but there is an elegant composure and poise even in their old age that comes with living long and knowing much. They are perfectly matched and believable as the old couple, and the result makes the film all the more emotionally devastating.Haneke has no non-diegetic music in his film, and the camera work is often removed and distant, so no emotional moment is not earned by his actors. And there are plenty of emotional moments in Amour. They will drain you of all happiness and levity you felt when you went into the movie. Amour makes the saddest film you've seen look like a cheap Nicholas Sparks novel.It also makes the film all the more harder to watch.However, to the thinking viewer, one who is ready to view an uncompromising, unsentimental, often removed and heart-wrenching film, Amour will prove to be brilliant, tragically sad, thought-provoking, and utterly unforgettable. Amour showcases Jean-Louis Trintiganant and Emmanuelle Riva's stunning and perfect acting, Michael Haneke's brilliant script and flawless camera work and editing, and one of the most true-to-life and beautiful depictions of true, undying love ever filmed.I would like to end with a brilliant quote from Empire's film critic David Hughes on Amour: ""In the course of two hours, Haneke suggests that the ultimate test of a lifelong passion may come not in its first flourish, but in the compassion of its very last days, and that while love cannot conquer death, it can give life's bleakest moments a run for their money. Viewed from this angle, Amour becomes not only one of the greatest films ever made about old age, but a love story for the ages. ""5 Stars! Recommended highly, but not to everyone.P.S. Also recommended: Another brilliant and heartbreaking foreign film about old age,Tokyo Story. See my review. Cheers!",5,Amour: A love story for the ages.,1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,5171,"['Michael', 'Haneke', 'director', 'polarizing', 'Palm', ""D'Or"", 'winningThe', 'White', 'Ribbonand', 'disturbing',

This is the story of how it really is when one partner must watch helplessly as the other suffers and loses themselves piece by piece.  Unflinchingly, the film documents this couple's descent into hell as the once-lovely wife slowly becomes a babbling invalid and the  husband uses every last ounce of his strength and humanity to spare her the indignity of institutionalization. To do so, he struggles with the curiosity of &#34;friends&#34;, the useless criticisms of their daughter, the callousness of caregivers and his own increasing infirmity and exhaustion.  There is a scene where the husband attempts to force his wife to drink water, and becomes so frustrated at her refusal that he slaps her.  We and he are shocked at this terrible turning point.

She lives at home with him and he tries to handle it.  But she keeps getting worse.  This movie is about the end for them.  They are a couple who have been in love their whole lives.  They had a complete life together.  They have a grown daughter. You see early pictures of them and they were beautiful.  Plus we know they are talented and affluent.

In rare exceptions (The Notebook) do we also see the waning days of love, and with Amour, we are witness to the end of a long union of husband and wife, whose longevity is matched by their love for one another.  It is a bittersweet study in the challenges and hardships that are grim reminders that although life is finite, love transcends time.  As written and directed by Michael Haneke (The Piano Teacher), the story is a realistic study of love, loyalty, and responsibility in a marriage.Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) are a married, elderly couple who share a love of classical piano music and live in a modest apartment.  One day, following a visit to a classical concert, Anne is paralyzed by a stroke, and as her body begins to fail her, she and her husband must adjust to a new way of living and the inevitability of the end.  What transpires in the following days and weeks amid concerns of their daughter, Eva (Isabelle Huppert), will test an enduring love to its very limits.Featuring two leading actors who starred in two of the more haunting, romantic films at the beginning of the French New Wave Cinema, (Riva in Hiroshima Mon Amour and Trintignant in A Man and a Woman), it is ironic that we see these veteran performers, as aged spouses.  Riva makes us feel for her, and she conveys much feeling with her facial expressions particularly in her eyes or the absence of any reaction as she convincingly depicts the gradual deterioration of a human being physically and spiritually.  Trintignant deserves credit for making us feel his plight as husband and caregiver. He gives Riva an equal in acting.The contrast of their day to day routines is thrown awry by fate, and the hardship of caring for an physically impaired family member is heartbreaking.  The details of hiring healthcare workers, helpful neighbors who buy groceries, acquiring a hospital bed or wheelchair, and even the simplest acts of human function are a challenge.  When Anne asks to see a family photo album, we know this is a sign that this is the beginning of the end of her quality of life as she is reviewing her past and better times.  There are moments you wonder how much can Georges take and to what lengths he will endure to support his wife's well being. There are echoes of Million Dollar Baby in the incapacity of a loved one and how those closest must come to terms with life.  It is a tragedy being played out before our eyes.There is symbolism of a pigeon that repeatedly flies into the apartment; perhaps it represents a precious life that is a metaphor for Anne.  Even the sounds of activity in their kitchen speak to their routine at mealtime. Indeed, most of the story takes place in their apartment.  The absence of a musical score adds to its realism and immediacy.Despite a somber tone, Amour is blessed with great performances that cap two legendary careers.  Give Haneke credit for an ambiguous, bold ending with its memorable imagery; it reaffirms the power of love. The film says that this may be the end of a life but not the end of love.",4,The Power of Love in AMOUR,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,3203,"['Most', 'filmed', 'love', 'stories', 'depict', 'beginnings', 'complications', 'couples', 'searching', 'happiness', 'future', 'together', 'rare', 'exceptions', 'Notebook', 'do', 'also', 'see', 'waning', 'days', 'love', 'Amour', 'are', 'witness', 'end', 'long', 'union', 'husband', 'wife', 'longevity', 'matched', 'love', 'one', 'bittersweet', 'study', 'challenges', 'hardships', 'are', 'grim', 'reminders', 'life', 'finite', 'love', 'transcends', 'time', 'written', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'Piano', 'Teacher', 'story', 'realistic', 'study', 'love', 'loyalty', 'responsibility', 'marriage.Georges', 'Jean-Louis', 'Trintignant', 'Anne', 'Emmanuelle', 'Riva', 'are', 'married', 'elderly', 'couple', 'who', 'share', 'love', 'classical', 'piano', 'music', 'live', 'modest', 'apartment', 'One', 'day', 'following', 'visit', 'classical', 'concert', 'Anne', 'paralyzed', 'stroke', 'body', 'fail', 'husband', 'must', 'adjust', 'new', 'way', 'living', 'inevitability', 'end', 'What', 'following', 'days', 'weeks', 'concerns', 'daughter', 'Eva', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'will', 'test', 'enduring', 'love', 'very', 'limits.Featuring', 'two', 'leading', 'actors', 'who', 'starred', 'two', 'more', 'haunting', 'romantic', 'films', 'beginning', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'Cinema', 'Riva', 'Hiroshima', 'Mon', 'Amour', 'Trintignant', 'A', 'Man', 'Woman', 'ironic', 'see', 'veteran', 'performers', 'aged', 'spouses', 'Riva', 'feel', 'conveys', 'much', 'feeling', 'facial', 'expressions', 'particularly', 'eyes', 'absence', 'reaction', 'gradual', 'deterioration', 'human', 'being', 'physically', 'spiritually', 'Trintignant', 'credit', 'making', 'feel', 'plight', 'husband', 'caregiver', 'Riva', 'equal', 'acting.The', 'contrast', 'day', 'day', 'routines', 'thrown', 'awry', 'fate', 'hardship', 'caring', 'physically', 'impaired', 'family', 'member', 'heartbreaking', 'details', 'hiring', 'healthcare', 'workers', 'helpful', 'neighbors', 'who', 'buy', 'groceries', 'acquiring', 'hospital', 'bed', 'wheelchair', 'even', 'simplest', 'acts', 'human', 'function', 'are', 'challenge', 'When', 'Anne', 'see', 'family', 'photo', 'album', 'know', 'sign', 'beginning', 'end', 'quality', 'life', 'reviewing', 'past', 'better', 'times', 'are', 'moments', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'Georges', 'take', 'what', 'lengths', 'will', 'endure', 'support', 'wife', 'well', 'being', 'are', 'echoes', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'incapacity', 'loved', 'one', 'how', 'closest', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'life', 'tragedy', 'being', 'played', 'out', 'symbolism', 'pigeon', 'repeatedly', 'apartment', 'perhaps', 'precious', 'life', 'metaphor', 'Anne', 'Even', 'sounds', 'activity', 'kitchen', 'speak', 'routine', 'mealtime', 'Indeed', 'most', 'story', 'place', 'apartment', 'absence', 'musical', 'score', 'realism', 'immediacy.Despite', 'somber', 'tone', 'Amour', 'blessed', 'great', 'performances', 'cap', 'two', 'legendary', 'careers', 'Give', 'Haneke', 'credit', 'ambiguous', 'bold', 'ending', 'memorable', 'imagery', 'power', 'love', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'end', 'life', 'not', 'end', 'love']",N/A

Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) decides at the end of her life to check out; her husband (Jean-Louis Tritingnant, in a memorable performance) tries in vain to keep her alive.

This is a film of quiet sophistication and respect and will likely stand as one of the greatest love stories ever placed before the public in a film.Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) are a couple of retired music teachers enjoying life in their eighties, attending concerts where Anne's pupil Alexandre (Alexandre Tharaud) is performing the Schubert Impromptus. In their comfortable home they enjoy each other's sensitivity and pleasures, but one morning at breakfast Anne suffers a TIA from which she seems to recover rather quickly. The moments of Anne's silence and lack of response trigger a sense of panic in Georges, and despite the fact that she recovers, he takes her to the hospital.  Anne undergoes a carotid endarterectomy but the surgical result is a failure (she is one of the 5% of failure rates). Returning home with a right hemiparalysis begins Anne's harrowingly steep physical and mental decline as Georges attempts to care for her at home as she wishes. Even as the fruits of their lives and career remain bright, the couple's hopes for some dignity prove a dispiriting struggle even as their daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert), also a musician, enters the conflict. In the end, George, with his love fighting against his own weariness and diminished future on top of Anne's, is driven to make some critical decisions for them both. The couple's bond of love is severely tested but then breathtaking conclusion radiates the power and durability of true love.Both Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva offer impeccable performances, and Isabelle Huppert adds a superlative supporting role as the daughter who does not seem to fathom her parents' love. The musical score is devoted to Schubert's Impromptus Nos. 1 and 3 and Moment musical No. 3, Beethoven's opus 126 Bagatelle No. 2 and opus 33 Bagatelles Nos. 2 and 4 and the Bach-Busoni Prelude Chorale `Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ'  - performed by pianist Alexandre Tharaud who also plays himself in the film as Anne's pupil.

We then get a brief flashback to the life of a cultured, sophisticated French couple, enjoying their golden years - an evening at a concert, stimulating conversation - before she suffers a stroke.When Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) returns home from the hospital, wheelchair-bound but mentally intact, she makes her husband, Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant), promise to never send her back.  She says there is no reason to go on living in her current state, and she does not want to be a burden on Georges.  His attentiveness and solicitousness, while necessary, rankle her.  A second stroke leaves Anne in much worse shape, both physically and mentally.  His vow to her leaves him almost as trapped as she is, while she sinks deeper into depression and despair over her body's betrayal.Viewers, particularly those who have experienced the heartbreak of caretaking for a loved one, will have reactions just as disparate as those expressed by the couple's family, friends, and caretakers.  Some will feel admiration for a husband's unwavering dedication to his wife. Others will feel frustration at his refusal to break a promise that has caused his life to be condemned to one in which he must stand by and watch as his wife deteriorates and slowly dies.

The decisions that they made about the way the film ended was nothing short of genius.I'm not going to go into how the acting was great; which it was, or how the writer and director (same person) was excellent; which he was, but just that this is an important film that needs to be watched.In this day and age when most films are escapism adventures that scare us, make us laugh or take us on journeys into the unknown, this film is in a genre by and of itself. It has elements which can be extremely familiar yet, at the same time, they can also seem very strange.Is this a perfect film? Probably not. Some have criticized how, at times, death and humanity seem distant and inhumane in the way the director presents some scenes. Others have not been fond of the pacing of the film, and have wished for it to have moved faster.So why is this an important film? Because life, love, old age, family and death are all issues that are universal and very much a part of each one of us. If love, old age, or death haven't found a way into your life just yet, I'm certain that they will. Despite it's imperfections, this still is an important film which may give us a fresh idea or teach us something new about those fundamentally important concepts of life, love, death, etc.And any film that teaches me something new about those fundamentals is an important film to me.

The very day after they go to a concert in which one of Anne's pupils, now a big classical music star, performs, Anne seems to 'fade away' for a bit during breakfast. She comes back to herself after a few minutes but this is the start of a slow and devastating process in which Anne's physical abilities deteriorate. Meanwhile we see Georges doing all he can to take care of Anne. Their daughter Eva (played by Isabelle Huppert), who lives in London, stops by a few times in the movie and with each visit grows more scared and worried about the state of affairs. I don't want to give away more of the plot, but let me just say there were a couple of scenes in which the audience in the theatre (a packed house, I might add) let out a huge gasp of surprise, if not shock.I don't know where to begin first with giving accolades for this movie, but let's start with the top: writer-director Michael Haneke, now 70, who was a late bloomer and started delivering great movies only in his late 50s, starting with The Piano Teacher, which he then followed with Cach&eacute; and The White Ribbon. This is surely his masterpiece, confirming all of the great things he has done before, and then some. Haneke brings this movie with dignity and compassion, but never turning sentimental or going for the easy tear-jerker. I just LOVE how Haneke lets a scene develop, taking his time and regularly with a single camera view. Kudos also to the two lead performances from Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva. While I am very happy that Riva got nominated for the Oscar for Best Actress, it is baffling that Trintignant, a giant in the French movie industry, was left out entirely from the Oscar nominations. Bottom line: I see well over 100 movies each year in the theatre, and I can unequivocally tell you that this is one of the very best releases from 2012, period.

1611533,A277MYG7MQTKYW,B00AIBZLHS,Robert Blenheim,"[5, 7]","Winner of the Golden Palm at Cannes, ""Amour"" is a magnificent masterpiece by arguably the greatest film artist alive in the world today, Michael Haneke.  Uncompromising and devastating in its emotional power, ""Amour"" tells of an elderly woman who falls victim to a stroke and her husband must deal with her illness as their lives move towards their inevitable end.Haneke displays a full understanding of and compassion for our human condition without resorting to any soap operatic banalities. He directs with his iconic cold austerity, appropriately keeping the camera at arm's length until the fatal if subtle exact moment of the stroke at the breakfast table when his style changes to an appropriate intimacy.  In Haneke, no element or shot is extraneous: like the attempted break-in at the beginning (a bringer of fear that perhaps brings on the event as well as being a harbinger of fate) and the pigeon who twice intrudes into their apartment, Haneke is certainly aware of its religious significance. This -- and his last masterpiece, ""The White Ribbon"" -- are two films that lay claim to him being the Austrian Bergman, and this is his ""Winter Light"".  It is harsh and cruel, but it is also compassionate.  It is also one of the great stories of love.  (One interesting point is that Haneke deliberately designed the apartment of the octogenarians to mirror the apartment of his own parents.)The film strikes me as formally perfect, as perfect as Michelangelo's Pieta, Mahler's Ninth or Bergman's ""Cries and Whispers"".

1611534,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00AIBZLHS,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","Most movies portray love at a time when the participants are young, healthy, physically attractive and just starting out in life, filled with promise and hope for the future. Rare indeed is the movie that focuses on love at the point when the participants are old, sick, frail, and keenly aware of their own mortality. And does love take the same form in those distinctly different periods in life or does it evolve into something new, and perhaps richer, over time?In Michael Haneke's &#34;Amour,&#34; two icons of French cinema - Emmanuelle Riva (&#34;Hiroshima, Mon Amour&#34;) and Jean-Louis Trintignant (&#34;A Man and a Woman,&#34; &#34;The Conformist&#34;) - portray Georges and Anne Laurent, two octogenarians who have been married for so long they probably can't remember a time before they were a couple. When Anne's health begins to decline rapidly due to a series of strokes, Georges assumes the role of full-time caregiver. Like all of us facing this situation, Georges is confronted with the dilemma of keeping Anne at home where she can be cared for by the man who loves her, or of placing her in an unfamiliar facility where she could be looked after by professional caregivers who would, however, be strangers. Georges chooses the former, despite the tremendous physical and emotional burden it places on him. This is clearly a couple who takes their &#34;for better or for worse...in sickness and in health&#8230;till death do us part&#34; wedding vows to heart. We aren't made privy to the kinds of trials Georges and Anne's love has had to endure over the years for them to have arrived at this point. But something has held them together all this time, and we sense that their life experiences and their commitment to one another have prepared them for this final challenge. Anne's illness becomes the crucible in which all lingering impurities will be burned away and out of which their love will emerge as solid and unbreakable. For only in times of utmost suffering and pain can love be manifested in its truest and purest form. And that is the message of Georges and Anne's story: true love is the ultimate act of selfless giving.The stars certainly understand this. Now in their 80s, with all traces of youthful vanity long gone from the scene, Riva and Trintignant together deliver an utterly raw and fearless portrayal of the debilitating effect aging can have on the mind, body and soul. How Riva lost the Best Actress Oscar that year is beyond mortal comprehension (like the good Lord, the Academy often truly does work in mysterious ways). Without a hint of histrionics, Riva turns suffering into a palpable thing, and Trintignant, who was not even nominated in the Best Actor category, is no less astonishing. In many ways, because his is the less showy role, he may actually have the more difficult acting challenge here. Either way, you really won't find better performances anywhere than you'll find in &#34;Amour.&#34;Because he knows he can rely on Riva and Trintignant to convey the beating heart of the story, Haneke has the good sense to make his presence as unobtrusive as possible, using long takes, stationary camera-work and a scoreless soundtrack to bring out the actors' work. He allows the scenes to play themselves out with minimal interference from anyone or anything that might distract from the performances (Isabel Huppert has a small but crucial role as the couple's daughter).It would be foolish to deny that &#34;Amour&#34; is a difficult film to sit through, that it is spare and unflinching and pulls no punches when it comes to portraying the ravages and sufferings of illness and old age. Haneke is relentless in making us stare directly into the ugly face of all that this couple is going through, to the point where even the audience can come to feel as trapped in the situation as Georges is in the apartment and Anne is in the body that has become her prison. Yet, that doesn't make &#34;Amour&#34; an experience we should shy away from. On the contrary, we should embrace it, for &#34;Amour&#34; never lies to us about the subject it has bravely chosen to explore. It assumes we are grown up enough to face the harsh realities of what it is showing us, and it is that respect for the audience that motivates us to respond in kind.There's an amazing scene in which Anne flips through a photo album of the couple's life together, and it is filled with pictures of Riva and Trintignant as we all remember them - when they were young, beautiful and full of life. It's a poignant reminder of not only how much they - and we - have changed over the years, but of what a special treat it is to be able to see them still acting at this late time in their lives, and still at the peak of their power. So many stars seem to fade from the scene long before their actual deaths, only to become a small news item or a blurb tucked away on an obituary page when death finally comes for them, often prompting us to exclaim, &#34;Oh, I didn't even realize that so-and-so was still around&#34; and to wonder what their lives were like in the interim between their deaths and the last time we recall seeing them. For more than any other reason, &#34;Amour&#34; is an invaluable treasure because it allows us to be a part of these two beloved actors' lives almost to the very end.",5,Love at its

1611538,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00AIBZLHS,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[9, 13]","Occasionally, a film is made so well, it transports you into the story and makes you a living, breathing part of it. And when these films depict realistic or real-life events, the effect is both exhilarating and horrifying. On the one hand, you are happy to be in the hands of filmmakers who are at the top of their game and extremely passionate about the story. On the other hand, the place they transport you to might not be so great.This is what film is supposed to do, transport you to a time and place, and I love it when this happens. But it doesn't happen often. In the last few months, it has happened twice.The winner of the Palme D'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival, ""Amour"" tells the story of two elderly Parisians (Jean-Louis Trintingnant and Emmanuelle Riva, two veteran actors), retired music teachers, who live a comfortable life in their Paris apartment. One morning, Georges notices that his wife, Anne, blanks out at the breakfast table, apparently unresponsive for a number of minutes. Just as he is about to rush out and get a doctor, she comes to and doesn't seem to realize what has just happened. This is the beginning of her mental and physical downward spiral. ""Amour"" paints an almost painful picture of this journey and depicts what her husband goes through while trying to care for his wife, the love of his life.Michael Haneke, the writer and director of one of my favorite films ""Cache (Hidden)"", has been creating a series of highly regarded films, each of which seems to be more emotional, powerful and critically applauded than the last. His latest features two veteran French actors painting a quiet, emotional story of the end of their lives.Basically, there are two characters in the majority of the film, Georges and Anna. Occasionally, a care worker or their daughter (Isabelle Huppert) pop in for a few moments, but the majority of the film is set in their Paris apartment and concentrates on their lives. This concentration does a few things. First, it shows us how isolated they have become from the rest of society. They seem to realize and acknowledge this, but to also accept it. They go out to watch a former student perform a concerto, Many weeks (months?) later, the student comes for a visit. It is obvious this is a well-meant, but isolated incident. When their daughter comes to visit, it is clear she is there primarily to see how her parents are doing, to check on the health of her mother. She never visits in a social manner leading to an emotional moment between father and daughter late in the film.The couple's isolation also allows us to focus only on them. We learn things about them while watching them, while listening to them, while observing. The beauty of this film is that these things are never revealed in a grand manner. In fact, if you blink, or go to the bathroom during the film, you might miss some of them. But because we are watching a film about the two characters, and they are virtually the only people in the film, your attention is always on them. And as you watch, you realize something. Although they don't say it, in fact I don't think they say it once during the entire film, Georges and Anna really do love one another. They have had a long and full life with one another so when the time comes for one of them to care for the other, the partner jumps into the role wholeheartedly.It quickly becomes clear that Georges will have to care for his ailing wife. Because they have been together for years, he knows that she doesn't like doctors or hospitals, so he observes her wishes and cares for her at home. As the story progresses, you see Anna's deteriorating health and the lengths Georges has to go to in order to care for his wife. It is heartbreaking because it is so difficult and so different from their lives before, when they were younger. How do I know about their earlier life? There are no flashbacks. Haneke gives us such an intimate portrait of this couple, you can almost imagine their earlier life. The trip to the concert at the beginning of the film, gives you an idea of the type of outing they must have had on a more regular basis. You can imagine them going to a concert and then sharing dinner at their favorite bistro. Now that they are older, they take the bus home. But as soon as they return to their apartment, they move like a well-oiled machine, anticipating each of their needs and wants.Jean-Louis Trintingnant is an actor I am not overly familiar with; he seems to have made a number of Jean-Luc Goddard films including ""A Man and a Woman"" and appeared in ""Three Colors: Red"". Trintingnant brings a quiet passion to his role as Georges. He doesn't express a lot of emotion, but this doesn't mean that Georges has no passion. Because they appear so natural together, you imagine the passion this older couple once had and you respect their long lives together. When it comes time to care for his ailing wife, he simply does it and does it in a way that he knows would respect his wife's choices and likes, even when the care is extremely demanding and physical.Emmanuelle Riva is also an actor I am not overly familiar; one of her notable films is ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"" and she was in ""Three Colors: Blue"". Her role as Anna is heartbreaking because we don't really watch it progress slowly. Haneke allows us into the couple's life for a period of time, cuts, and then thrusts us back into their life a few days, weeks or months later. It is difficult to tell, because there is never any warning when we are going to make one of these time jumps. But each time we return to their lives, it is clear that Anna is continuing to decline. And the jumps between each state are jarring. Riva's performance is mesmerizing and riveting because she seems to fully inhabit Anna's deteriorating state. It is a difficult role to pull off because she has great difficulty speaking and can't communicate with her husband, daughter or us. And there is a lot of sadness in her performance as she tries to cope with a failing body.The two actors seem completely natural with one another and their performances complement one another perfectly. Trintingnant is quiet, intense and impassive. Riva is loud, distressed and very vocal because Anna is in so much pain.Isabelle Huppert pops in a few times to check on the state of her mother. Her reactions are the reactions I think we would all have. We would want our parents to be cared for in the best way possible. And she reacts in the way most of us would react, as though we know what the best way is. The role is handled perfectly, adding punctuation to the portrayal of this couple's life.Haneke has crafted another emotional, intense film that is sure to have you grabbing a hanky at least a few times.I know many people only want to go to films to ""feel good"" which means they probably go to a lot of comedies or romantic films or films with uplifting messages. But anytime I go to see a film that is as good as either of these is, whatever the subject matter, that makes me feel good. I enjoy seeing filmmakers working at the height of their crafts, creating films that will stay with me and that I will remember for a long time to come. ""The Impossible"" and ""Amour"" are both extremely well-made and transport you to dark places, places that you probably will not want to go to every weekend. But if you miss these works, you will be missing two of the best films of the year.And now that I have seen this film, I will be very happy to never see it again. Instead, I eagerly look forward to the next film from Michael Haneke.",5,"""Amour"" j'ai taime",1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,7584,"['Occasionally', 'film', 'made', 'so', 'well', 'story', 'living',

1611539,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00AIBZLHS,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","""Amour"" is a Michael Haneke film, which means something heavy and uncomfortable even to moviegoers accustomed to European art house films. His movies are often perplexing (""The White Ribbon"") and disturbing (""Funny Games""), even to the point of grating against one's sensibilities. So, despite its title, ""Amour"" does not have to be sweet and beautiful. This may be a love story, but even so, it is told with icy realism and zero sentimentality.The storyline itself is simple. Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) are retired music teachers living a quiet life in a Paris apartment. One day Anne has a stroke (in a bizarre fashion) that leaves her partially paralyzed. As her illness progresses, the aged couple's life slowly becomes nightmarish in spite of, or because of, their love.Most scenes are set in a closed space where the octogenarian couple lives. The film keeps a measured pace throughout, with some key events happening off-screen. As seen in his ""Cache,"" drawing suspense from the static images is Haneke's forte, and he makes a good use of the place's claustrophobic mood that becomes unbearable as the story unfolds.Probably ""Amour"" is the Austrian director's most accessible film to date. It is not an easy watch, to be sure, but its theme is universal and its approach to the subject matter less pretentious. The film is intelligent, but its intelligence does not prevent us from being emotional.",4,"Love and Nightmare in Michael Haneke's ""Amour""",1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,1438,"['Amour', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'film', 'something', 'heavy', 'uncomfortable', 'even', 'moviegoers', 'accustomed', 'European', 'art', 'house', 'films', 'movies', 'are', 'often', 'perplexing', 'White', 'Ribbon', 'disturbing', 'Funny', 'Games', 'even', 'point', 'grating', 'one', 'sensibilities', 'So', 'title', 'Amour', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'sweet', 'beautiful', 'may', 'be', 'love', 'story', 'even', 'so', 'told', 'icy', 'realism', 'zero', 'sentimentality.The', 'storyline', 'simple', 'Georges', 'Jean-Louis', 'Trintignant', 'Anne', 'Emmanuelle', 'Riva', 'are', 'retired', 'music', 'teachers', 'living', 'quiet', 'life', 'Paris', 'apartment', 'One', 'day', 'Anne', 'stroke', 'bizarre', 'fashion', 'partially', 'paralyzed', 'illness', 'aged', 'couple', 'life', 'slowly', 'nightmarish', 'spite', 'love.Most', 'scenes', 'are', 'set', 'closed', 'space', 'where', 'octogenarian', 'couple', 'lives', 'film', 'measured', 'pace', 'key', 'events', 'happening', 'off-screen', 'seen', 'Cache', 'drawing', 'suspense', 'static', 'images', 'Haneke', 'forte', 'good', 'use', 'place', 'claustrophobic', 'mood', 'unbearable', 'story', 'unfolds.Probably', 'Amour', 'Austrian', 'director', 'most', 'accessible', 'film', 'date', 'not', 'easy', 'watch', 'be', 'sure', 'theme', 'universal', 'approach', 'subject', 'matter', 'less', 'pretentious', 'film', 'intelligent', 'intelligence', 'not', 'prevent', 'being', 'emotional']",N/A

1611541,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00AIBZLHS,Turfseer,"[9, 12]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***I didn't like Michael Haneke's 'The White Ribbon' as it was a fable that had little basis in reality. Haneke is on much more solid ground with 'Amour' as the story is based on experiences Haneke observed with one of his own relatives. A story such as 'Amour', which involves the deterioration of a stroke victim and her husband's valiant efforts to care for her, becomes problematic when true-life events are reproduced almost verbatim. Fortunately, Haneke mixes things up enough to keep our interest, and then throws in a twist ending of sorts, which will come as a surprise to most viewers, who likely won't be expecting such a turn of events.The stroke victim in question is Anne, who lives with her husband, Georges, both retired music teachers. When Anne blacks out at the breakfast table one morning, Georges knows something is wrong but Anne doesn't seem to have any memory of the incident. It turns out she has a blocked carotid artery but after undergoing surgery, Anne ends up paralyzed on one side.The first half of 'Amour' involves Georges' efforts to help Anne with her rehabilitation. He holds her up out of her wheelchair and she takes feeble steps, using her one good leg, and dragging the other. Eventually, Anne has another stroke, which reduces her to a child-like state; often, she talks in gibberish. Georges becomes more frustrated as there are moments when Anne refuses to swallow the soft food Georges is trying to spoon feed her.Outside visitors occasionally impinge on Anne and Georges' depressing world. Early on, before the second stroke, one of Anne's students, a well-known classical pianist pays a visit and asks Anne what happened to her. She understandably doesn't want to discuss her situation, merely stating that her condition is a result of 'old age'. Later, Anne and Georges' daughter, Eva, pays a visit, and argues with her father, recommending that she put Anne in a home. Georges' reacts angrily and considers Eva's suggestion callous. It eventually comes out that the relationship between daughter and parents is not good, primarily due to her British-born husband, who apparently the parents did not care for too much.After Georges decides to hire a second nurse, he discovers that this particular woman has been mistreating Anne (in a particularly upsetting scene, the nurse pulls Anne by the hair, lifting her face to a mirror and mocks her to the effect, 'don't you want to see your pretty face'?). Georges fires the nurse but she indignantly claims that she's never had a problem before with any of her employers and rudely curses the old man, before leaving.It's interesting that the family doctor is never seen during the entire film. The visitors to the apartment, however, serve to break up the monotony of Anne's deterioration, not only for Georges but for the audience as well. While Haneke has managed to hold our interest until the second act crisis, he's treading in dangerous waters, as it's at this point in the film when the audience's patience is tested. Just how much more of this chronicle of Anne's downward spiral, can anyone take?SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. DO NOT READ FURTHER UNLESS YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT A TWIST ENDING!'Amour' suddenly morphs into a crime drama of sorts when the caring Georges, suddenly decides he can't take it anymore, and smothers Anne with a pillow. He prepares the body so that when the police finally arrive, Anne appears in a dignified state. He also seals the door with masking tape, presumably to prevent the foul odor from permeating the apartment. Then Georges pens a final note and while it's not entirely clear, it appears he commits suicide, to join his wife in death. Right before the note, Georges captures a pigeon that has flown into the apartment, but lets it go, perhaps symbolizing that he finally has let Anne go, by effecting the mercy killing.If you've ever read any newspaper articles about mercy killings, where the spouse who does the killing, ends up committing suicide, 'Amour' pretty much explains why these things go on. The mercy killing also provides food for thought by bringing up the issue of keeping a comatose patient alive while in a vegetative or extremely debilitated state. It's easy to take a 'holier than thou' attitude, but when you're in a situation like Georges, do you completely condemn him for 'snapping'? And would you have been so self-sacrificing for a family member as he was? Many of us would probably have went along with the daughter's advice to place the debilitated relative in a home, thus leaving the care to others, who might have ended up as caring as the second nurse, who Georges was forced to fire.Veteran actors Emmanuelle Riva as Anne and Jean-Louis Trintignant, are excellent as the tragic couple. I understand that Trintignant came out of retirement, to play this role (he hadn't been in a film for 14 years). 'Amour' is not an easy film to watch but it's important to remind people that illness in old age is a reality and it could happen to anybody. With its jarring ending, Haneke has managed to raise this documentary-like feature to the higher realm of true art.",4,Grim documentary-like exploration of stroke victim's journey is raised to realm

1611542,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B00AIBZLHS,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[11, 14]","Written and directed by Austrian film-maker Michael Haneke, Amour is an elegant, beautifully acted and painfully unflinching look at an elderly couple dealing with the challenges of decline in old age where one partner becomes increasingly debilitated and the other must shoulder the ever-increasing responsibilities of being the caregiver. It is given even greater gravitas by the extraordinary performances of the two main actors, each a legendary veteran of French cinema with over sixty years of experience to their name, Jean-Louis Trintignant (A Man and a Woman) and Emmanuelle Riva (Hiroshima, Mon Amour).Georges (Trintignant) and Anne (Riva) are retired music teachers. Now in their eighties, they have over fifty years of married life together and live quite comfortably in the apartment they have shared for the last half-century.  Their daughter, Eva (Isabelle Huppert), who is also a musician, is grown and living abroad with a family of her own.  One morning, while eating breakfast, Anne suddenly goes catatonic, staring blanking ahead and not responding to Georges' increasingly worried attempts to rouse her. She recovers a few minutes later when Georges is about to call for an ambulance. At first Georges accuses her of playing a prank on him, but it soon becomes clear that Anne has no memory of the episode. When Georges tries to tell her what just happpened, she in turn tells him he must be losing his mind, refusing to believe what he's telling her.A trip to the doctor, which Anne resists but finally gives in to, reveals that she is suffering from a blockage of the carotid artery. Surgery is attempted but is unsuccessful, and worse, results in her suffering a stroke which leaves her partially paralyzed and dependent on a wheelchair.  Upon returning home, Anne makes Georges promise not to send her back to the hospital or into a nursing home. She is adamant that she doesn't want to live that kind of life.  Georges is uncertain about the wisdom of this, but he nonetheless promises to abide by her wishes and he takes on the role of caregiver. At first, it seems like they may be able to carry on somewhat as before. A visit from a former pupil of theirs, who is now a famous concert pianist, seems to go well, but when he leaves them a cd of his music and Georges begins to play it, Anne suddenly becomes melancholy, realizing that she herself will never again be able to play the way she once did. As time passes her condition deterioriates, particularly after she apparently suffers another stroke that leaves her face half-paralyzed and makes speaking even simple words an arduous effort. Georges keeps his promise, looking after Anne in spite of the increasing strain her care puts on him. He hires a nurse to help out three days a week, but eventually even that assistance is not enough and he has to hired a second nurse. Eva, their daughter, worries at what she sees when she visits and wants her mother to go into care, but Georges refuses, saying he will not break the promise he made to his wife. At the same time, Georges has no illusions about where things are heading. When Eva asks what will happen next, he bluntly replies ""Things will go on, and then one day it will all be over.""It is to the film's credit that it does not turn away from Anne's increasingly painful-to-watch decline or from the increasing stresses it puts on Georges, on their relationship, and on the family dynamics between Anne, Georges and Eva. Some scenes are particularly difficult to watch, but are unflinching in their realistic depiction of the kind of things that occur to people in these situations, in the way they have to deal with limited options, with chronic pain and the confusion of advancing dementia, with frustration over the simplest things like feeding and communicating. But that said, it does make for painful viewing, particularly for anyone who has ever had to deal with a spouse or parent experiencing that kind of debilitation and decline.Both Trintignant and Riva are supberb in their performances. Riva's Anne, for which she was nominated for the Academy award for Best Actress, is a masterpiece, utterly convincing at each stage of her decline from her normal pre-stroke self to the painful-to-watch trapped self she become as her body and eventually mind fail her. In one scene where Anne stubbornly refuses to drink the water Georges is coaxing on her, Riva is limited to conveying Anne through her eyes and the hard set of her stroke-afflicted face. Wordless, it nonetheless speaks volumes. Trintignant's performance as Georges is more subtle in its delivery, being in many ways the more sympathetic role, but he does it very effetively, going beyond the obvious cliches associated with caregivers and raising questions about Georges' motivations. Is his stubborn shouldering of his burden due solely to his promise to Anne, or is there perhaps something else at work, something ultimately selfish in his refusal to have her go to a nursing home where she could perhaps get better care but which would mean his having to live without her? Isabelle Huppert's performance as Eva is also excellent, showing the frustrations both of a daughter having to watch her mother decline and knowing in spite of her protests that there must be _something_ that can be done, that in fact the medical options have been exhausted and there is nothing that can be done. And the frustrations of, in spite of being an adult, she is still the child of the family and cannot undo the decades of parental authority that have preceded this moment. Again, anyone who has gone through a similar experience in the family or with a loved one will strongly relate to the story that unfolds in Amour.As writer and director, Haneke (The White Ribbon, Cach&eacute; and The Piano Teacher) brings a masterful hand to the project. Though slow-paced in the beginning, it proceeds nonetheless at an appropriate pace, every scene having meaning and purpose in bringing out the story taking place on the scene, filling in little but important details about the characters, making it possible for the actors to give them their full depth. Nominated for five Academy awards including Best Picture, Director and Original Screenplay, Amour also won the coveted Palm D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival as well as Golden Globe, BAFTA and European Film Awards.  It is truly a work, not only of great performances, but of great craftsmanship as well.Highly, highly recommended.",5,"Elegant, beautifully acted and painfully unfliching",1361059200,"02 17,

1611545,A1OAJIRS05LWB,B00AIBZLHS,Zach Pajak,"[6, 8]","I don't often care for reviews that give away entire scenes, but the best and most helpful way for me to describe the experience of seeing this film is to describe briefly two small moments that happen very early in the story (they do not give away plot or surprises):1)  There is an extended take from the point of view of a stage looking directly at its auditorium's audience as they settle down before a concert.  In this moment, we are one and the same with the audience onscreen, looking into each other from our theater seats like two mirrors.  This feeling and the communality of it never quite go away as the story unfolds.2)  In a subsequent scene that takes place the next morning, the married couple eats breakfast (both are music teachers, their student having been the performer the previous night).  The husband reminisces about a powerful film -- a love story -- he saw as a young man that, when attempting to describe it to a neighbor, led him to weep intensely.  When describing the film to his neighbor, he says, he'd wept harder than he already had during the actual experience of seeing the film.  The feeling created by the love story was so powerful for him, he could not hide his tears from his neighbor, which he had feared happening.The filmmakers of 'Amour' created a love story of such intimate, tremendous power, that the audience may very well react to it as the elderly husband reacted to the love story he'd seen as a young man.  This Amazon.com reviewer certainly did, and will carry 'Amour' with him for a very long time; it is engrained in my memory and heart.Director Michael Haneke, his actors, and all the film's collaborators created a masterpiece in 'Amour,' a film so real, so intense, and so authentic.  I dare not give away any more scenes or instances; in fact, the story is so personal, I'd feel as if sharing more about the film's characters is similar to sharing about something so intimate in the lives of actual people, namely something that we can and will all relate to that it is heartbreaking in its universality.",5,"The real and the universal, all at once",1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,2065,"['do', ""n't"", 'often', 'care', 'reviews', 'give', 'away', 'entire', 'scenes', 'best', 'most', 'helpful', 'way', 'describe', 'experience', 'seeing', 'film', 'describe', 'briefly', 'two', 'small', 'moments', 'happen', 'very', 'early', 'story', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'surprises', ':1', 'extended', 'take', 'point', 'view', 'stage', 'looking', 'directly', 'auditorium', 'audience', 'settle', 'down', 'concert', 'moment', 'are', 'one', 'same', 'audience', 'onscreen', 'looking', 'other', 'theater', 'seats', 'two', 'mirrors', 'feeling', 'communality', 'never', 'quite', 'go', 'away', 'story', 'unfolds.2', 'subsequent', 'scene', 'place', 'next', 'morning', 'married', 'couple', 'eats', 'breakfast', 'are', 'music', 'teachers', 'student', 'having', 'been', 'performer', 'previous', 'night', 'husband', 'powerful', 'film', 'love', 'story', 'saw', 'young', 'man', 'when', 'attempting', 'describe', 'neighbor', 'led', 'weep', 'intensely', 'When', 'describing', 'film', 'neighbor', ""'d"", 'wept', 'harder', 'already', 'had', 'actual', 'experience', 'seeing', 'film', 'feeling', 'created', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'powerful', 'could', 'not', 'hide', 'tears', 'neighbor', 'had', 'feared', 'happening.The', 'filmmakers', ""'Amour"", 'created', 'love', 'story', 'such', 'intimate', 'tremendous', 'power', 'audience', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'react', 'elderly', 'husband', 'reacted', 'love', 'story', ""'d"", 'seen', 'young', 'man', 'Amazon.com', 'reviewer', 'certainly', 'did', 'will', 'carry', ""'Amour"", 'very', 'long', 'time', 'engrained', 'memory', 'heart.Director', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'actors', 'film', 'collaborators', 'created', 'masterpiece', ""'Amour"", 'film', 'so', 'real', 'so', 'intense', 'so', 'authentic', 'dare', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'more', 'scenes', 'instances', 'fact', 'story', 'so', 'personal', ""'d"", 'feel', 'sharing', 'more', 'film', 'characters', 'similar', 'sharing', 'something', 'so', 'intimate', 'lives', 'actual', 'people', 'namely', 'something', 'can', 'will', 'relate', 'heartbreaking', 'universality']",N/A
