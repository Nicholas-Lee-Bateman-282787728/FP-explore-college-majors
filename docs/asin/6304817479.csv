I was overwhelmed with joy when I watched them and it dawned on me that this was the series I saw years ago.  After doing some research on this series, this DVD set has all but four episodes.  The series only lasted one season...so in all, this is almost the complete series.What is Ghost Stories like?  Don't get is confused with the other series also called ghost stories with the english dude, which is kind of dry and boring.  This series is very much like Twilight Zone or Tales from the Darkside in that each episode is self-contained and originally ran for 30 minutes.  There is a warning label on the DVD set that it is not suitable for those under 13 basically for suspense and some minor gore and grizzly makeup effects.  Anyway , if you love Twilight Zone, Tales from the Darkside, Outer Limits but wanted more of that supernatural/ ghost story edge, this is the series for you....and 40 episodes to boot : )",5,Awesome series!,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,1017,"['had', 'seen', 'few', 'episodes', 'when', 'aired', 'television', 'then', 'received', 'set', 'present', 'was', 'overwhelmed', 'joy', 'when', 'watched', 'dawned', 'was', 'series', 'saw', 'years', 'ago', 'doing', 'research', 'series', 'DVD', 'set', 'four', 'episodes', 'series', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'season', 'so', 'almost', 'complete', 'series.What', 'Ghost', 'Stories', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'confused', 'other', 'series', 'also', 'called', 'ghost', 'stories', 'english', 'dude', 'kind', 'dry', 'boring', 'series', 'very', 'much', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Tales', 'Darkside', 'episode', 'self-contained', 'originally', 'ran', '30', 'minutes', 'warning', 'label', 'DVD', 'set', 'not', 'suitable', '13', 'basically', 'suspense', 'minor', 'gore', 'grizzly', 'makeup', 'effects', 'Anyway', 'love', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Tales', 'Darkside', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'wanted', 'more', 'ghost', 'story', 'edge', 'series', '.and', '40', 'episodes', 'boot']",N/A

I bought mine from an e-Bay seller, who advertised that these stories will give you the chills.  I was intrigued and entertained, by these stories didn't keep me awake at night.  Most of them take place in Texas and Arizona, while a few were in the midwest and California.  They also talked about the Native American and Asian customs concerning the spirit world which I thought were fascinating.  I was surprised that there was no coverage of the eastern seaboard, which is teeming with all sorts of spirits, ranging back to the colonial and Civil War periods.  Perhaps the original show was cancelled before they got the chance to seek out these places.  At any rate, I think you'll enjoy the stories on these tapes.  The reason I give this product a 4-star review instead of a 5 was the quality of the tapes.  I had problems with the second and sixth tapes jumping all over the place before my VCR adjusted them.

I liked the price, so I purchased it. On the (...) I decided to open the set to find out just what I had. I thought this set would contain bad acted trash that I could laugh at.In fact, this is actually an amazing series. The actors are completely competent, the locations are perfect for ghost story affect, the music is Mark Snow eerie, and the violence or horror or intensity is haunting. The show has a ""Dead Man's Gun"" air to it. Rip Torn is the narrator. He has a Kris Kristofferson affect that sets the mood.These are ghost stories. Someone is murdered and he, or she, comes back from the dead for revenge. Or, someone longs for peace from a miserable life, only to find it in the arms of ghostly irony. Or, much more.I did some research on this series. There are 44 episodes of this show. 40 of them are in this 5 disc set. At 30 minutes each you are talking 20 some hours of content. For (...), this is the best DVD value purchase I have ever made! I like this show that much. Even the packaging is good. The outside is cool and each disc has it's own holder. Snapshots from the series adorns the inside of the jacket. You can even choose individual episodes with ease off the discs.This show was origionally aired on FOX family network. I can not imagine how or why that happened. This stuff is intense, very violent, very scary, sometimes extremely freaky, and will give young children nightmares. I am 45 years old and I have a 12 year old boy and I will not allow him to view this set. There is tons of cigarette smoking, much alcohol abuse, adult language and themes, and shocking scenes - example, the very first episode has a woman being run-over by a truck. She is then placed in a container and pushed into a lake. She is still alive and screaming for her life as the container sinks sending her to ""Ghost Story"" revenge land. I can hear those screams right now.I LOVE IT! But, this is not for the kids.I say buy this box set. ""Ghost Stories"" is ten times better than the last ""Twilight Zone"" incarnation.
