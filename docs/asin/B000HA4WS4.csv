But what a horrible choice of titles...Who sits on top of Universal Home video and points his finger to some of the worst movies ever made? What about consulting a film historian for a change, instead of a marketing guy?""Kiss and Make Up"" is probably Grant's worst film ever, the unfunniest comedy of the 30s with the actor ostensibly trying to make something out of a bad script. Not to mention ""Wedding Present"" and ""Big Brown Eyes"", what a comedic misfires...As for ""Wings in the Dark"", believe it or not, Grant plays a blind aviator who flies up to the sky to save Myrna Loy from falling (in a way it's also sort of, unintentionally, funny). The only good one is ""Thirty Day Princess""...These people at Universal just ignored that at Paramount Grant made two great films, one of them never published at all and it's called ""Hot Saturday"", a pre-code, pre-lib, comedy in which Nancy Carroll gets it her own way without paying any price, actually she wins a wonderful prize...The other title (published just on video) is ""The Eagle and the Hawk"" with Fredric March and Carole Lombard. And among better films he made for the studio ""The Woman Accused"", ""This is the Night"" and ""Madame Butterfly"".

1011606,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,B000HA4WS4,Douglas M,"[5, 5]","This cheap DVD collection contains 5 Paramount films from the mid thirties before Cary Grant hit the really big time. Only hindsight tells us that he was more than the conventional good looking leading man but each film has some point of interest even if all are fairly routine Paramount programmers of the period.- ""30 Day Princess"" is a Ruritanian romance with the charming Sylvia Sidney in a dual role as an out of work actress who is employed to imitate a princess. Grant plays a cynical reporter here and gives a very stiff and humourless performance. This film was a change of pace for Sidney who excelled as a tragedienne and she is delightful but the film is very light weight.- ""Kiss and Make-up"" is a tenuous pre-code send up of the beauty industry with Grant as a scientist running a beauty clinic. The gossamer Genevieve Tobin plays his masterpiece creation and the film is an uneasy mixture of satire and music. Grant sings a charming song ""Love divided in two"" in his shaky tenor and even Edward Everett Horton sings too. To really take off, this film needed Lubitsch directing and a star like Maurice Chevalier but Grant is OK.- ""Wings in the Dark"" is a neat drama with Grant playing a blind flier opposite stunt woman Myrna Loy. They make a pleasant team and Loy's customary underplaying works well here making convincing the unlikely romance and melodrama.- ""Big Brown Eyes"" is a very amusing film with Grant cast as a detective and Joan Bennett as a manicurist then reporter who together solve a crime. The film is well directed by Raoul Walsh, moves quickly and has some provocative characters, including a shot of two young criminals on a bed together which could imply something the censorship would not allow.  Bennett is very entertaining here, chewing gum and tossing off her tart lines like Jean Harlow. She is also very pretty. Walter Pidgeon is suave and menacing as the heavy.- ""Wedding Present"" is a poor screwball comedy with mannequin like  Bennett and Grant paired again as reckless reporters falling in and out of love. There is far too much talk and the screwball fails, mainly because Bennett is very wooden here, but Grant was by 1936 a much more relaxed comedian and he does his best to hold the film together.The prints are generally good (""Wings in the Dark"" is the worst) but there are no extras included.

No, they are not the standout films of our time or theirs, no they will enter nobody's list of the top hundred or top thousand of all time. They are what was seen most days, for most years, in the urban neighborhood or small town movie houses, of the 30's and 40's. They are mostly short, inexpensive, quickly made, films made to fill the second billed slot on the standard double feature of those depression and war years. They were intended to have a very short shelf life playing sequentially from the first run down through the flop house theaters mainly used by what today we would call the homeless to sleep with some protection from the elements through the night.They were then stored to deteriorate into a chemical sludge or to disappear as film companies merged, went bankrupt, were destroyed by fire.Today,who cares what the script is like when one sees Grant and Myrna Loy, for example, refining the screen persona's that served them so well for a generation more of film making.Of course, I have no idea of what viewers of another time and place, another outlook, experience when they see these films.

The films in this set fall during his stint as a romantic leading man, but his flair for comedy shines through.Thirty Day Princess is an excellent little movie about a foreign princess who comes to America to advertise her poor country and winds up with the measles. Her backer decides to find a look-alike to stand in for the princess while she recooperates. A struggling actress (Sylvia Sydney) is chosen. Part of her duties is to embarass a well-known newspaper man (Grant), but she finds herself falling in love with him instead. The swift pace and glamour of the film makes it great fun to watch.Kiss and Make Up is the weakest of the five films. It features some definitely pre-code elements like a woman stripping down to her underwear early in the film. Once a scientist, Dr. Lamar (Grant) decides to change course and enter the beauty field. He works to make women beautiful and in the process falls in love. The plot drifts around, but it is fun to see Grant so young and fresh, and to hear him sing, even if his voice isn't perfect.Wings in the Dark is a great melodrama about a pilot and inventor (Grant) who goes blind in an accident. His wife (Myrna Loy) is also a pilot who decides to risk herself in order to protect her husband's work. There are many twists and turns to keep the audience at the edge of their seat throughout the film, and it works. It is hard not to get into this one despite some of it being a bit predictable. Grant is wonderful as a blind man and Loy is great too.Big Brown Eyes is an exciting detective movie about a gumshoe (Grant) who enlists the help of his manicurist girlfriend (Joan Bennett) to solve a murder. There is evidence everywhere, but no one can seem to solve the case. Just another run of the mill murder mystery, this movie won't stick out in your mind, but you'll have loads of fun watching and re-watching it.Wedding Present also stars Bennett as Grant's fiancee. The two newspaper reporters bicker constantly and find themselves separated from each other for various reasons, but it is obvious that they're meant for each other the whole time. Another fun film.These are my kind of movies. They aren't important historically and most people don't know of their existence. But they're good. They're fun to watch and feature great casts.

The quality of the DVDs are good and all of the movies COULD have been good, but they're lacking a certain something...I guess the scriptwriters weren't experts on comedy. The best film by far is ""Thirty-Day Princess"", but the other films are basically just time-fillers for me.If you're a real big fan of Cary Grant, I recommend this box set. But if you're looking for great comedies from the thirties, I suggest you look elsewhere.",3,Well...,1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,598,"['was', 'pretty', 'excited', 'when', 'got', 'DVD', 'set', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'good', 'comedic', 'actor', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'early', 'movies', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'are', 'good', 'movies', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'good', ""'re"", 'lacking', 'certain', 'something', 'guess', 'scriptwriters', 'were', ""n't"", 'experts', 'comedy', 'best', 'film', 'far', 'Thirty-Day', 'Princess', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'basically', 'just', 'time-fillers', 'me.If', ""'re"", 'real', 'big', 'fan', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'recommend', 'box', 'set', ""'re"", 'looking', 'great', 'comedies', 'thirties', 'suggest', 'look', 'elsewhere']",Cary Grant: Screen Legend Collection (Big Brown Eyes / Kiss and Make Up / Thirty Day Princess / Wedding Present / Wings in the Dark)

I would have liked having them on separate disks. (Only Wedding Present is, Thirty Day Princess and Kiss and Make Up are on one disk, Wings in the Dark and Big Brown Eyes share the third disk.) All are crowded together in a cardboard tri-fold case. They deserve better packaging and artwork. But don't let that stop you from buying them.
