My 4 year old son could count to 29 on his own but he had trouble recognizing his numbers by sight. This video helped him learn his numbers in a week. It teaches shapes, colors, and patterns also. The counting is taught by 1s and by 10s and now he can count all the way to 100 with just a little help from mom and dad.For the entertainment aspect, he LOVES this one. We have the Math Circus too but my sons don't request to see that one much. They love blasting off to the moon!Highly recommend.",5,Helped My Son Recognize His Numbers,1287100800,"10 15, 2010",2010,618,"['had', 'letter', 'Leap', 'Frog', 'DVDs', 'are', 'excellent', 'wanted', 'try', 'one', 'help', 'son', 'numbers', '4', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'could', 'count', '29', 'own', 'had', 'trouble', 'recognizing', 'numbers', 'sight', 'video', 'helped', 'learn', 'numbers', 'week', 'shapes', 'colors', 'patterns', 'also', 'counting', 'taught', '1s', '10s', 'now', 'can', 'count', 'way', '100', 'just', 'little', 'help', 'mom', 'dad.For', 'entertainment', 'aspect', 'one', 'have', 'Math', 'Circus', 'too', 'sons', 'do', ""n't"", 'request', 'see', 'one', 'much', 'love', 'blasting', 'off', 'moon', 'Highly', 'recommend']",N/A

I feel that Leap Frog understands one of the great techniques of learning...repetition, repetition and repetition.It takes a while to learn a new concept (the older you are the longer, it seems) so putting simple math skills to animation and singing allow my girls to grasp and retain the information they are learning.Math Adventure to the Moon was created with the 3-6 year old age group in mind. While my girls already knew most of the concepts it was a great way to review what they have learned in school. I enjoy hearing them walk around the house singing the little songs that Tad and Lily sing in the DVD. It reminds me that they are obtaining the information.Math Adventure to the Moon would be a perfect DVD to pick up for your preschooler or Kindergartner....allowing them an introduction into learning...yet, giving them the joy of music, cartoon characters and ""friends"" with which they can learn.",4,I love leap frog products,1268438400,"03 13, 2010",2010,1017,"['have', 'many', 'Leap', 'Frog', 'products', 'home', 'name', 'can', 'trust', 'count', 'help', 'girls', 'learn', 'feel', 'Leap', 'Frog', 'one', 'great', 'techniques', 'learning', 'repetition', 'repetition', 'repetition.It', 'while', 'learn', 'new', 'concept', 'older', 'are', 'longer', 'so', 'putting', 'simple', 'math', 'skills', 'animation', 'singing', 'allow', 'girls', 'grasp', 'retain', 'information', 'are', 'learning.Math', 'Adventure', 'Moon', 'was', 'created', '3-6', 'year', 'old', 'age', 'group', 'mind', 'girls', 'already', 'knew', 'most', 'concepts', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'review', 'what', 'have', 'learned', 'school', 'enjoy', 'hearing', 'walk', 'house', 'singing', 'little', 'songs', 'Tad', 'Lily', 'sing', 'DVD', 'are', 'obtaining', 'information.Math', 'Adventure', 'Moon', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'pick', 'up', 'preschooler', 'Kindergartner', '.allowing', 'introduction', 'learning', 'yet', 'giving', 'joy', 'music', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'friends', 'can', 'learn']",N/A

Ever since my first born arrived, I have purchased Leap Frog products. All his toys were from the Leap Frog line and we headed into the DVD's quickly.My daughter is a big fan of anything that will help her learn so when she saw this come in, we barely had our coats off before she was ripping it open to put it in the DVD. She grabbed her notepad and box of crayons ready to learn. (She loves to copy what she sees, usually writing the words on the screen).  She was so focused on the movie that she NEVER wrote on the paper.In A Nutshell: Anything that your kids will watch and WILL teach them is good in my book. The characters are likable and familiar if your kid knows Leap Frog. Tad and Lily have been there from the beginning.What I Can Tell You: Goddess age 4.11 LOVED it. She watched it and then watched it again. Today she was singing the songs from it and excited about numbers where her focus in the past was letters and sounds.
