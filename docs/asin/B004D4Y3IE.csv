The picture quality is amazing even compared to the other two seasons that have been released.The only issue I have with this version is that when compared to the official releases of Season 1 and Season 7, there are no extras - no commentary on some episodes from the teams or no extra scenes that you can see if you wish. That is what made Season 1 and Season 7 DVDs even better.But all in all, if you are even a slight fan of the Amazing Race, you'll love revisiting a great, early season.",4,"Great quality, missing the extras",1307750400,"06 11, 2011",2011,570,"['am', 'huge', 'TAR', 'fan', 'love', 'fact', 'can', 'get', 'official', 'copy', 'Season', '2', 'picture', 'quality', 'amazing', 'even', 'compared', 'other', 'two', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'released.The', 'only', 'issue', 'have', 'version', 'when', 'compared', 'official', 'releases', 'Season', '1', 'Season', '7', 'are', 'extras', 'commentary', 'episodes', 'teams', 'extra', 'scenes', 'can', 'see', 'wish', 'what', 'made', 'Season', '1', 'Season', '7', 'DVDs', 'even', 'better.But', 'are', 'even', 'slight', 'fan', 'Amazing', 'Race', ""'ll"", 'love', 'revisiting', 'great', 'early', 'season']",The Amazing Race: Season 2

""Cole""","[1, 1]","I am a huge TAR fan and I've been in heaven these past couple of weeks as I've been pouring through the seasons that have been released on DVD.  This particular season began slowly with a few forgettable teams being weeded out but before long there was drama cooking amongst the remaining racers. I thoroughly enjoyed the fantastic locations while the much improved fluidity was noticeable compared to the first season. I will say that I was confused as to why 5 discs were needed when 3 have sufficed for other seasons but I imagine space issues had something to do with it.The teams were well-cast with one particular team being known for their dysfunctional relationship that was the subject for much drama over the course of the race. Detours and roadblocks were varied but are different in comparison for current seasons. The final legs boil down to some heated competition and feature some team blunders, including a team losing a clue which leaves them stranded, forgive the pun, clueless. The race to the finish line is one of the most memorable as featured an actual foot race to the mat.This season is memorable and it is exciting, an excellent entry in the storied franchise and a look into the humble beginnings of a legendary show.",5,Starts slow but finishes in frantic fashion!,1337472000,"05 20, 2012",2012,1244,"['am', 'huge', 'TAR', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'been', 'heaven', 'past', 'couple', 'weeks', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pouring', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'particular', 'season', 'began', 'slowly', 'few', 'forgettable', 'teams', 'being', 'weeded', 'out', 'long', 'was', 'drama', 'cooking', 'remaining', 'racers', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'fantastic', 'locations', 'much', 'improved', 'fluidity', 'was', 'noticeable', 'compared', 'first', 'season', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'confused', 'why', '5', 'discs', 'were', 'needed', 'when', '3', 'have', 'sufficed', 'other', 'seasons', 'imagine', 'space', 'issues', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'it.The', 'teams', 'were', 'well-cast', 'one', 'particular', 'team', 'being', 'known', 'dysfunctional', 'relationship', 'was', 'subject', 'much', 'drama', 'course', 'race', 'Detours', 'roadblocks', 'were', 'varied', 'are', 'different', 'comparison', 'current', 'seasons', 'final', 'legs', 'boil', 'heated', 'competition', 'feature', 'team', 'blunders', 'including', 'team', 'losing', 'clue', 'stranded', 'forgive', 'pun', 'clueless', 'race', 'finish', 'line', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'featured', 'actual', 'foot', 'race', 'mat.This', 'season', 'memorable', 'exciting', 'excellent', 'entry', 'storied', 'franchise', 'look', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'legendary', 'show']",The Amazing Race: Season 2

1396653,A2ARDVMUGDFED6,B004D4Y3IE,MiRSD,"[3, 4]","For anyone unfamiliar, The Amazing Race is a reality show about 11 teams (groups of 2 people - twins, siblings, friends, husband/wife, etc..) who race around the world and complete some (sometimes odd) tasks which give them a clue to where they're going next. In 28 days they travel 52,000 miles into 5 continents/8 countries.It's one of the reality shows that I've really liked as it's entertaining throughout (seeing the odd tasks, the different locations, and the people).The Amazing Race: The First Seasonwas released on DVD, withThe Amazing Race - The Seventh Seasonout shortly after.. and then nothing.Fortunately, Amazon is now offering (exclusively) Amazing Race - Season 2.It's an Amazon Exclusive in that it's part of their burn-on-demand program. That means that rather than being a mass-produced DVD, Amazon will actually burn a DVD (or set of DVDs) when you order, put them in a case and send it out to you.There are some Pro's and Con's to this - the PRO obviously being that this would otherwise not be released! The CON being that these are DVD-R's (complete with purple-back), usually lack extras, and can sometimes be pricey.The set arrives in 2 DVD cases (3 discs in 1, 2 discs in the other (5 total)) - labeled ""PART 1"" and ""PART 2"". Fortunately they are sold together and not actually sold as individual parts (like some companies do).The DVDs are in full-screen format, ranging from 1-3 episodes per disc (most discs being 3 episodes). These are hour-long episodes which come out to about ~44 minutes each on DVD. Audio is in stereo.Video quality is good - nothing terrible but nothing great (keep in mind it is fullscreen as this was made back in 2002). Sound is the same - nothing great, but it is a TV show.Unfortunately there are no extras. This is a bit disappointing as the previous DVD sets (season 1 & 7) had all sorts of extras (90 minutes of additional scenes, audio commentary, never-aired footage, interviews, around the world with the hosts/creators, 3 hours of never-before-viewed-scenes, each episode containing never before seen footage, etc..)These discs are just the episodes.Besides that, the artwork on the cases doesn't fit with the previous sets (the previous sets coming in slim DVD cases inside of a box, with the logo on the spine - these just say ""THE AMAZING RACE 1"" and ""2"" (with ""the second season"" being very small and not easy to read). A VERY small issue, but it doesn't fit with the other sets, for anyone who cares about these things.One of the issues I have though - this set costs more than the other DVD sets. Season 1 and 7 were professionally done, include extras and sell for about 20-30 dollars. This set is 35 dollars (usually), for  a 'burned' DVD set and no extras.Aside from that, I love the show and if you do too, this is worth getting - I only hope they release the other series'",4,Great series - price is a bit much for a Burn-on-Demand set.,1303948800,"04 28, 2011",2011,2849,"['anyone', 'unfamiliar', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'reality', 'show', '11', 'teams', 'groups', '2', 'people', 'twins', 'siblings', 'friends', 'husband/wife', 'etc..', 'who', 'race', 'world', 'complete', 'sometimes', 'odd', 'tasks', 'give', 'clue', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'next', '28', 'days', 'travel', '52,000', 'miles', '5', 'continents/8', 'countries.It', 'one', 'reality', ""'ve"", 'really', 'liked', 'entertaining', 'seeing', 'odd', 'tasks', 'different', 'locations', 'people', '.The', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'First', 'Seasonwas', 'released', 'DVD', 'withThe', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'Seventh', 'Seasonout', 'shortly', 'after..', 'then', 'nothing.Fortunately', 'Amazon', 'now', 'offering', 'exclusively', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'Season', '2.It', 'Amazon', 'Exclusive', 'part', 'burn-on-demand', 'program', 'rather', 'being', 'mass-produced', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'will', 'actually', 'burn', 'DVD', 'set', 'DVDs', 'when', 'order', 'put', 'case', 'send', 'out', 'are', 'Pro', 'Con', 'PRO', 'obviously', 'being', 'would', 'otherwise', 'not', 'be', 'released', 'CON', 'being', 'are', 'DVD-R', 'complete', 'purple-back', 'usually', 'lack', 'extras', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'pricey.The', 'set', 'arrives', '2', 'DVD', 'cases', '3', 'discs', '1', '2', 'discs', 'other', '5', 'total', 'labeled', 'PART', '1', 'PART', '2', 'Fortunately', 'are', 'sold', 'together', 'not', 'actually', 'sold', 'individual', 'parts', 'companies', 'do', '.The', 'DVDs', 'are', 'full-screen', 'format', 'ranging', '1-3', 'episodes', 'disc', 'most', 'discs', 'being', '3', 'episodes', 'are', 'hour-long', 'episodes', 'come', '~44', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'Audio', 'stereo.Video', 'quality', 'good', 'nothing', 'terrible', 'nothing', 'great', 'keep', 'mind', 'fullscreen', 'was', 'made', 'back', '2002', 'Sound', 'same', 'nothing', 'great', 'TV', 'show.Unfortunately', 'are', 'extras', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'previous', 'DVD', 'sets', 'season', '1', '7', 'had', 'sorts', 'extras', '90', 'minutes', 'additional', 'scenes', 'audio', 'commentary', 'never-aired', 'footage', 'interviews', 'world', 'hosts/creators', '3', 'hours', 'never-before-viewed-scenes', 'episode', 'containing', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'footage', 'etc..', 'discs', 'are', 'just', 'episodes.Besides', 'artwork', 'cases', ""n't"", 'fit', 'previous', 'sets', 'previous', 'sets', 'coming', 'slim', 'DVD', 'cases', 'box', 'logo', 'spine', 'just', 'say', 'THE', 'AMAZING', 'RACE', '1', '2', 'second', 'season', 'being', 'very', 'small', 'not', 'easy', 'read', 'VERY', 'small', 'issue', ""n't"", 'fit', 'other', 'sets', 'anyone', 'who', 'things.One', 'issues', 'have', 'though', 'set', 'more', 'other', 'DVD', 'sets', 'Season', '1', '7', 'were', 'professionally', 'done', 'include', 'extras', 'sell', 'about', '20-30', 'dollars', 'set', '35', 'dollars', 'usually', ""'burned"", 'DVD', 'set', 'extras.Aside', 'love', 'show', 'do', 'too', 'worth', 'getting', 'only', 'hope', 'release', 'other', 'series']",The Amazing Race: Season 2

Even after all these years, and all the jackasses that have been on the show, it just soothes my soul to see that guy RUINED. Over, and over, and over, seeing the smug wiped right off his horrible face--it just makes me believe in justice on a bad day...It would have been better, obviously if some other team had done it--I'm not fan of the boys particularly--but it's the most satisfying moment of the race that it in fact DID get done.THANK YOU,THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU AMAZON!!",5,STILL the most satisfying ending of any race,1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,993,"['love', 'Race', 'even', 'tolerate', 'abomination', 'was', 'Family', 'Edition', 'So', 'perspective', 'favorite', 'Race', 'moment', 'ever', 'Swing', 'fat', 'bastard', 'Kevin', 'Drew', 'Race', '1', 'Television', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'that.The', 'funniest', 'Race', 'moment', 'ever', 'Colin', 'Ox', 'Race', '5', 'PLEASE', 'HURRAY', 'Amazon', 'most', 'SATISFYING', 'moment', '19', 'races', 'watching', 'now', 'thank', 'AMAZON', 'RE', 'watching', 'CLEARLY', 'Boston', 'Boys', 'run', 'down', '*', '^', 'Will', 'last', 'quarter', 'mile', 'race', 'Even', 'years', 'jackasses', 'have', 'been', 'show', 'just', 'soothes', 'soul', 'see', 'guy', 'RUINED', 'Over', 'over', 'seeing', 'smug', 'wiped', 'right', 'horrible', 'face', 'just', 'believe', 'justice', 'bad', 'day', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'obviously', 'other', 'team', 'had', 'done', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'boys', 'particularly', 'most', 'satisfying', 'moment', 'race', 'fact', 'DID', 'get', 'done.THANK', 'YOU', 'THANK', 'YOU', 'THANK', 'YOU', 'THANK', 'YOU', 'AMAZON']",The Amazing Race: Season 2

As far as the quality of the video and audio is concerned, it's good but not great. That doesn't really does not matter since this is the one DVD that makes me take the DEEP PLUNGE for the 55 inch LED TV and blu-ray player. Well worth it on the largest screen to see the part in Australia and New Zealand.This season is truly amazing compared to the later ones. The action is really fast paced toward the end with tons of twists and turns. Without revealing the ending, the two hours finale is definitely a NAILBITER!I wish CBS can release more of this AMAZING show, my favorite reality series. Currently only three seasons are available. Truly blessed to have the last few working copies before it went out of the stock!
