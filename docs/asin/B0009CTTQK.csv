903788,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B0009CTTQK,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","Yusuke Urameshi is a high school delinquent. He doesn't go to class, and he's always getting in fights. One day he is trying to save a boy that is about to be hit by a car, he is killed instead. He is approached by a pretty girl flying on a broom. Her name is Botan, and she's the Grimm Reaper.She offers him a chance to regain his life. After coming back to life Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective. He gain spiritual powers and hunts down rogue apparitions that cause trouble for the living world. He is joined by his friend Kuwabara, the demons Hiei and Kurama. Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.After the tournament we are faced with the dramatic conclusion to an epic series that is now an anime legend. Yusuke returns home where Kayko has been waiting for him for all the years that he has been gone. The group of friends is reunited, and Yusuke  & Kayko can begin their long awaited romance. Everyone lives happily ever after.This is a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",5,All good things must come to an end,1353110400,"11 17, 2012",2012,1556,"['Yusuke', 'Urameshi', 'high', 'school', 'delinquent', ""n't"", 'go', 'class', 'always', 'getting', 'fights', 'One', 'day', 'trying', 'save', 'boy', 'be', 'hit', 'car', 'killed', 'instead', 'approached', 'pretty', 'girl', 'flying', 'broom', 'name', 'Botan', 'Grimm', 'Reaper.She', 'chance', 'regain', 'life', 'coming', 'back', 'life', 'Yusuke', 'Spirit', 'Detective', 'gain', 'spiritual', 'powers', 'hunts', 'down', 'rogue', 'apparitions', 'cause', 'trouble', 'living', 'world', 'joined', 'friend', 'Kuwabara', 'demons', 'Hiei', 'Kurama', 'Together', 'fight', 'off', 'deadly', 'demons', 'seek', 'destroy', 'world.After', 'tournament', 'are', 'faced', 'dramatic', 'conclusion', 'epic', 'series', 'now', 'anime', 'legend', 'Yusuke', 'home', 'where', 'Kayko', 'been', 'waiting', 'years', 'been', 'gone', 'group', 'friends', 'reunited', 'Yusuke', 'Kayko', 'can', 'begin', 'long', 'awaited', 'romance', 'Everyone', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.This', 'great', 'series', 'lots', 'cool', 'characters', 'good', 'animation', 'voice', 'acting', 'very', 'engrossing', 'story', 'very', 'long', 'anime', 'so', 'want', 'watch', 'be', 'prepared', 'like', 'spend', 'long', 'time', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'Even', 'bang', 'up', 'start', 'flow', 'would', 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'anime', 'series', 'time', 'bit', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'vibe', 'everyone', 'likes', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Yu', 'Yu', 'Hakusho', 'anime', 'fan', 'simply', 'amazing']",Yu Yu Hakusho - Yusuke Rediscover Vol. 32 Uncut

Trailers for other productions and textless songs are not the most engaging features. That's why I got this single disc. It contains the last....3-4 episodes of YYH and have several commentary tracks. Same quality as the boxset episodes (uncut and looked the same to me).
