480211,A146D2LYLICNLS,6305822484,eric_f,"[10, 10]","&quot;Fire On The Amazon&quot; is just like the 1987 film &quot;Hangmen&quot; in that only die-hard Sandra Bullock fans who absolutely must own every movie she's been in would be interested in purchasing. And that's pretty much all there is to it. &quot;Fire On The Amazon&quot; offers nothing of interest to the everyday movie watcher. In fact it's pretty abysmal, with a plot that will leave you scratching your head and rolling your eyes. But it does have Sandra Bullock in it, and that is a good thing.Ok, now to Sandra's nude scene (which, let's face it, is why 99% of people would want to own this movie). It's actually pretty good, if you can overlook the cheesiness of it. No T&amp;A, but it does show a full-body shot of Sandra and the photographer getting it on, soft porn style. The rest of the scene is basic movie lovemaking style. Please note that I'm going by the Unrated version, which only seems to be available on VHS. I haven't seen the R-rated version but I would guess that it shows less and probably cuts out the full body shot.Bottom line: get this movie only if you love Sandra Bullock and want to see her before she became a household name, or if you simply want to see her only nude scene. But as I said you're better off getting the VHS Unrated version if your only purpose is to see Sandra in the buff.",2,"for Bullock completists only (and oh yeah, the nude scene)",1079568000,"03 18, 2004",2004,1330,"['quot', 'Fire', 'Amazon', 'quot', 'just', '1987', 'film', 'quot', 'Hangmen', 'quot', 'only', 'die-hard', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'fans', 'who', 'absolutely', 'must', 'own', 'movie', 'been', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'purchasing', 'pretty', 'much', 'quot', 'Fire', 'Amazon', 'quot', 'nothing', 'interest', 'everyday', 'movie', 'watcher', 'fact', 'pretty', 'abysmal', 'plot', 'will', 'leave', 'scratching', 'head', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'have', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'good', 'thing.Ok', 'now', 'Sandra', 'nude', 'scene', 'let', 'face', 'why', '99', '%', 'people', 'would', 'want', 'own', 'movie', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'can', 'overlook', 'cheesiness', 'No', 'T', 'amp', 'A', 'show', 'full-body', 'shot', 'Sandra', 'photographer', 'getting', 'soft', 'porn', 'style', 'rest', 'scene', 'basic', 'movie', 'lovemaking', 'style', 'Please', 'note', ""'m"", 'going', 'Unrated', 'version', 'only', 'be', 'available', 'VHS', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'R-rated', 'version', 'would', 'guess', 'less', 'probably', 'cuts', 'out', 'full', 'body', 'shot.Bottom', 'line', 'get', 'movie', 'only', 'love', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'want', 'see', 'became', 'household', 'name', 'simply', 'want', 'see', 'only', 'nude', 'scene', 'said', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'getting', 'VHS', 'Unrated', 'version', 'only', 'purpose', 'see', 'Sandra', 'buff']",Fire on the Amazon Unrated Edition  VHS
480212,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6305822484,"""flickjunkie""","[6, 8]","I guess everyone has to start somewhere.  This 1990 film, released direct to video in 1993, and re-released this year, harkens back to the beginning of Sandra Bullock's film career when she was probably thrilled to get a B  movie script.  Actually, to call this a B movie would be the kindest of  prevarications.  It was nowhere near that good.  A mediocre plot was marred  by dreadful directing, wretched cinematography and awful acting.The film  starts out like a recruiting film for the protest arm of the Sierra Club,  with people locked in human chains to keep loggers from cutting down the  rainforest.  The leader is assassinated and then our heroine (Sandra  Bullock), teams up with a whacked out photo journalist (Craig Sheffer) to  find the killer and expose corruption.  At this point it tries to convert  to an action adventure thriller in the jungles of the Amazon.It  fails.There are so many things to criticize in this film, I hardly know  where to begin.  Let's try cinematography.  The color quality was awful,  scenes were constantly out of focus and the lighting was poor.  We had  overexposures, and underexposures with no regard to effect.  How about  audio? The sound was muddy, the music was poor.  And acting?  The acting  was amateurish, bumbling and shrill.Directing?  Luis Llosa must have  been on a tight budget.  It seems like he did the whole film in one take.  Actors were flubbing lines all over the place, but the cameras kept  rolling.Okay, but what about Sandra?  She was a raw talent at this point  (in more ways than one).  This film provides us with her one and only nude  scene, which may be its only claim to fame.  But don't rush to the movie  store to rent it because of this.  Though it is clear she is fully unclad,  you really see nothing, which is probably a blessing.  I love Sandra  Bullock, but let's face it, she has a body only Popeye could love, and adds  nothing to a film by appearing in the buff.  Actually, her acting here  showed promise, especially in one scene where she is trying to revive a  child just rescued from a fire.  But there is a clear difference in her  skills and confidence compared with present day.This film is a must NOT  see for anyone, especially Sandra Bullock fans.  Why mar your good opinion  of her.  I rated this film a 2/10.  It is an appalling waste of time.  Why  they revived it, I can only wonder.",1,Uuugh!

480214,AXLW246TETRY1,6305822484,Lunchbox,"[3, 5]","can't believe that Fire on The Amazon needed to be cut (there's the R-rated version of 78 minutes and another one of 85 minutes). Really, there isn't anything particularly disturbing...well, there is absolutely nothing offensive...really.And for those who think that the nude scene with Sandra Bullock worths it, I don't know what planet you can be from...really, I didn't know there was that scene before watching it, and if I had known, I wouldn't have rented this, because, even though the scene doesn't show anything, I didn't want to see Sandra doing the thing.Anyways, these few lines were an overview of the whole film's point, so you can imagine how pointless this film can be. The storyline has nothing particular, though it is not bad either, but nothing comes out of this movie...It talks about an environmentalist that has been murdered (and the killer used an arrow, to make people believe it was an indian-were they making a joke to show how stupid authorities can be and believe that if the guy has been killed with an arrow, it automatically has to be an indian guy that killed him?). And a journalist (Craig Sheffer)(who has the bad -and that will probably get on your nerves- habit of always taking photos) followed by a woman that works nearby (Sandra Bullock) investigate and go further in their researches of the real killer (because an indian had already been accused).Well, the acting in this film isn't bad at all, and that's really surprising, because Sandra Bullock has, usually, the habit of playing her characters like an half-brained maggot. But in this film, she is actually really natural and good. The storyline is very ordinary, but its development is really poor. The directing is painful to watch, especially because of the picture quality, but also for the atmosphere that it delivers-it makes the film even more boring.Actually, the major problem with Fire on The Amazon is the plot. Really, it looks as if they first wanted to make an adventure movie, with an investigation, but the director and producers seemed to have had a change of their mind, and to have changed their objectives of the film. Let me explain. (Spoilers warning) There's a part where Bullock and Sheffer try to follow an indian guy in a boat. When they arrive, another man tries to kill them (and hits Sheffer in the shoulder, after what he seems totally okay, by the way), but they survive. After this mild peril (and the way it happens it really is mild peril, because the director doesn't seem to know how a scene of suspense should be done!), they join the indians in their village, and they eat some kind of herbs that make them high. And that's where the director had his mind twist...he made his characters eat some herbs and he gives the reason that it's an indian ritual...and it gives him a reason to introduce a scene of sexuality, where Sheffer and Bullock (who previously couldn't stand each other, by the way) make love while they're high, in very multiple positions (and that's what shocked the censors, even though there is no visible nudity showing anyone's private parts). Now, the question is; why did they put this scene? Maybe they've been inspired by the herbs they smoked before writing the scenario...and it's an inside joke by the producers...I didn't find it funny anyways...After that, another mind twist from the director, which is to kill some characters. There are some gunfights (really, this doesn't even deserve to be called &quot;action&quot;, the fight scenes are shameful).One other thing, the running time. I've seen the 85 minutes version, and even though 85 minutes represents a very short film in my opinion, this was long and dull. Nothing happens in this film, nothing makes you jump on your seat. Every time something supposedly (or that is supposed to be) interesting, you just realize how lame and wrongfully filmed it is. Luis Llosa (who also brought us masterpieces such as The Specialist, Sniper, and of course, Anaconda- feel the sarcasm here?) just doesn't know how to deliver some scenes, and in this film, it happens to be the most important ones that he missed.Finally, Roger Corman is the producer...I'm saying it again, Roger Corman is a symbol...when you see that name on a movie box, and you're looking for some quality film, avoid it. Roger Corman is a synonym of &quot;bad movie&quot; or &quot;cheesy movie&quot; or &quot;lame movie&quot;. And this one doesn't even have the merit of going in the &quot;cheesy&quot; category. This is plain bad, and boring. Bullock acted very well, for the first and last time in her career, but when you're falling asleep while watching a movie, even if the lead actress is good, it's still a very bad movie...",1,Roger Corman Presents...once again,1065484800,"10 7, 2003",2003,4712,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Fire', 'Amazon', 'needed', 'be', 'cut', 'R-rated', 'version', '78', 'minutes', 'one', '85', 'minutes', 'Really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'particularly', 'disturbing', 'well', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'offensive', 'really.And', 'who', 'think', 'nude', 'scene', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'worths', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'there', 'was', 'scene', 'watching', 'had', 'known', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'rented', 'even', 'scene', ""n't"", 'show', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Sandra', 'doing', 'thing.Anyways', 'few', 'lines', 'were', 'overview', 'whole', 'film', 'point', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'pointless', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'storyline', 'nothing', 'particular', 'not', 'bad', 'nothing', 'movie', 'environmentalist', 'been', 'murdered', 'killer', 'used', 'arrow', 'make', 'people', 'believe', 'was', 'indian-were', 'making', 'joke', 'show', 'how', 'stupid', 'authorities', 'can', 'be', 'believe', 'guy', 'been', 'killed', 'arrow', 'automatically', 'be', 'indian', 'guy', 'killed', 'journalist', 'Craig', 'Sheffer', 'who', 'bad', '-and', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'nerves-', 'habit', 'always', 'taking', 'photos', 'followed', 'woman', 'nearby', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'investigate', 'go', 'further', 'researches', 'real', 'killer', 'indian', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'accused', '.Well', 'acting', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', 'really', 'surprising', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'usually', 'habit', 'playing', 'characters', 'half-brained', 'maggot', 'film', 'actually', 'really', 'natural', 'good', 'storyline', 'very', 'ordinary', 'development', 'really', 'poor', 'directing', 'painful', 'watch', 'especially', 'picture', 'quality', 'also', 'atmosphere', 'delivers-it', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'boring.Actually', 'major', 'problem', 'Fire', 'Amazon', 'plot', 'Really', 'first', 'wanted', 'make', 'adventure', 'movie', 'investigation', 'director', 'producers', 'seemed', 'have', 'had', 'change', 'mind', 'have', 'changed', 'objectives', 'film', 'Let', 'explain', 'Spoilers', 'warning', 'part', 'where', 'Bullock', 'Sheffer', 'try', 'follow', 'indian', 'guy', 'boat', 'When', 'arrive', 'man', 'kill', 'Sheffer', 'shoulder', 'what', 'totally', 'okay', 'way', 'survive', 'mild', 'peril', 'way', 'really', 'mild', 'peril', 'director', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'how', 'scene', 'suspense', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'join', 'indians', 'village', 'eat', 'kind', 'herbs', 'make', 'high', 'where', 'director', 'had', 'mind', 'twist', 'made', 'characters', 'eat', 'herbs', 'reason', 'indian', 'ritual', 'reason', 'introduce', 'scene', 'sexuality', 'where', 'Sheffer', 'Bullock', 'who', 'previously', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'other', 'way', 'make', 'love', ""'re"", 'high', 'very', 'multiple', 'positions', 'what', 'shocked', 'censors', 'even', 'visible', 'nudity', 'showing', 'anyone', 'private', 'parts', 'Now', 'question', 'why', 'did', 'put', 'scene', 'Maybe', ""'ve"", 'been', 'inspired', 'herbs', 'smoked', 'writing', 'scenario', 'inside', 'joke', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'funny', 'anyways', 'mind', 'twist', 'director', 'kill', 'characters', 'are', 'gunfights', 'really', ""n't"", 'even', 'deserve', 'be', 'called', 'quot', 'action', 'quot', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'shameful', 'other', 'thing', 'running', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', '85', 'minutes', 'version', 'even', '85', 'minutes', 'very', 'short', 'film', 'opinion', 'was', 'long', 'dull', 'Nothing', 'film', 'nothing', 'jump', 'seat', 'time', 'something', 'supposedly', 'supposed', 'be', 'interesting', 'just', 'realize', 'how', 'lame', 'wrongfully', 'filmed', 'Luis', 'Llosa', 'who', 'also', 'brought', 'masterpieces', 'such', 'Specialist', 'Sniper', 'course', 'Anaconda-', 'feel', 'sarcasm', 'here', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'deliver', 'scenes', 'film', 'be', 'most', 'important', 'ones', 'missed.Finally', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'producer', ""'m"", 'saying', 'again', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'symbol', 'when', 'see', 'name', 'movie', 'box', ""'re"", 'looking', 'quality', 'film', 'avoid', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'synonym', 'quot', 'bad', 'movie', 'quot', 'quot', 'movie', 'quot', 'quot', 'movie', 'quot', 'one', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'merit', 'going', 'quot', 'cheesy', 'quot', 'category', 'plain', 'bad', 'boring', 'Bullock', 'acted', 'very', 'well', 'first', 'last', 'time', 'career', 'when', ""'re"", 'falling', 'asleep', 'watching', 'movie', 'even', 'lead', 'actress', 'good', 'still', 'very', 'bad', 'movie']",Fire on the Amazon Unrated Edition  VHS

I bought this DVD a couple of months ago, after reading some reviews, and discovering it very cheap in HMV. So I bought it. And I only just watched it for the first time. Normally I buy DVDs and watch them straight away. This one I kept putting off, and off, and just never watching it today. Finally, I decided I would watch it. It got off to a very slow start, and then Sandra Bullock and the very Heath Ledger-looking whatshisface, Craig Sheffer, appeared. I only really bought this to see what Sandra Bullock was like in one of her very early films. The very porn film style sex scene was not needed, and it could have done with much less & still given so much more. (Did that make sense?) Much too graphic, and my little innocent eyes :) practically popped out my head! Sandra Bullock's character was played v. well, but I read in an interview recently, that Sandy has written into her contract that she will NOT do sex scenes anymore. Any wonder why, after seeing this? Craig Sheffer's character was very much the wide-boy, constantly taking photos, and getting generally annoying.One good thing about this movie ... OK, two! One, is it's only 85 minutes. So pretty short. (Here's me talking, I was getting bored by only 38 minutes!) The second is the song over the end credits. I love it! I'm hunting here trying to find it.The extras on the DVD ... More than I actually expected for a basic DVD! It had the trailer (which showed too much of the film), and a photo gallery, and trailers of other films out at the same time - none of which I've heard of, and most of which I surprisingly want to see!I was surprised that this film received an 18 certificate. Apart from the sex scene, there was really nothing else which deserved it. Hardly any violence. So ... that was surprising.Sandy is not her normal self. In more recent films, she's either playing an action girl (Speed, Speed 2), or being her witty charming self (Miss Congeniality, 28 Days). In Fire On The Amazon, she hasn't found her niche yet.

So I just had to see what I'm not supposed to see.  And she is so gorgeous, wouldn't it be nice to see her nude?  I made sure to get the unrated and uncut version; I have never seen the cut version, so I cannot advise on the difference.  The movie is actually a loser, but fast forward to her nude lovemaking scene (after she and her lover succumb to the influence and effects of a powerful potion that the natives gave them to drink) and it is this nude scene that makes the movie worth seeing.

One of the protest leaders is killed and the story becomes a very bad who-dun-it. I kept hoping for Sheffer to die, but alas that was not the case. The sole attraction of this film is the love scene between Bullock and Sheffer where she shows more skin than usual, with strategic spots missing the camera so as to not technically classify it (in my book) as a nude scene per se.
