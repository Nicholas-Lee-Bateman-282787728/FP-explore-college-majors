I went to Target today to pick this up, and glad I looked at the list on the back, alot of the titles sounded familar, so I didn't buy it.  I looked at some of our other George DVDs mostly the most recent 2 or 3 sets and saw some of the same titles.  I don't really track how a season of these PBS shows are structured or what's from what season, but I sorta assumed when I saw this title announced it would be all new content.  Glad I didn't buy it without seeing the episode list.  So just a word of caution.School of Dance, DJ George, Sock Monkey Opera, George and Allie's Automated Car Wash are on Volume 20 ""Dance Party"".George Buys a Kite, and Train of Light are on Volume 19 ""Saves the Day""Ok, so 6 are duplicates that I can confirm.
