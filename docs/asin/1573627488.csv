190755,A3MFU0GVZUVH3K,1573627488,"Betty L. Dravis ""BETTY DRAVIS, author/reviewer""","[5, 5]","I boughtShark Attackjust to see the lovely actor Jenny McShane in action, and she did not disappoint me. She's a fine actor, as is Casper Van Dien. I was particularly amused and entertained by the role of the cab driver who aided the main actors and was disappointed that he didn't appear prominently in the credits. His name is Tony Caprari and he was very impressive in his part, adding a welcome touch of humor on occasion.The storyline: In a once-prosperous African fishing village, a rash of brutal shark attacks is terrorizing the population and destroying the local economy. When Van Dien's character, marine biologist Steven McKray, learns of the death of his scientist friend he is devastated. He teams up with the friend's sister (McShane)to discover what really happened and why the sharks are unusually aggressive. What they discover is a sinister plot to draw the sharks in towards shore for reasons I can't disclose without being a ""spoiler,"" but I can say the bottom line is greed for ""oil""This film is filled with frightening shark scenes and wild car chases that end in fiery blow-ups; enough to keep anyone on the edge of his seat. It's a gripping movie with a good plot, good actors and the right amount of twists and turns to keep one guessing. Van Dien and McShane fight courageous battles to save their own lives as well as the lives of other villagers. Without telling too much, it was a stroke of genius for them to get the townspeople involved, especially with law enforcement being in cahoots with the villains.It's predictable that McShane and Van Dien begin to care for each other, but who can object to that? Love makes the world go around and always adds an added dimension to any movie. And sure, as critics say, some of the shark scenes were obviously ""canned,"" but those sharks sure seemed creepy and real to me. For a low-budget movie, I think the producers and director did an excellent job with this nail-biter.And, boy, was it fun seeing the really, really bad guys get what was coming to them!

His friend, Shark Expertman, suspects foul play.  So he and Mark's sister go on a shark filled adventure to the bottom of the fishing grounds of some local tribesmen.  The tribesmen didn't harpoon Mark's laptop though so the heroic duo look elsewhere.  Then they find bad scientist.  He is bad, or is he?  But he is bad, because the whole movie is bad so are all the actors.  The shark footage is good, but because it is literally ripped from past &quot;Shark Weeks&quot; it was really familiar.  As a final note, the last shot of a shark clearly shows a fishing line stuck in it's mouth.  This line has nothing to do with &quot;Shark Attack&quot; but probably had something to do with the Discovery Channel episode it was initially filmed for.  This movie should be shark attacked.

In a day and age when computer imaging has taken precedence over physical effects (especially in lower budgeted movies), it is actually refreshing to find a killer shark movie that utilizes stock footage and giant rubber monsters. As apparent as they both may be, the attempts to bring the sharks to life by combining these techniques has to be admired considering the size of the picture. The only unfortunate drawback is the lack of suspense that results from the virtual clip show of documentary footage that clearly separates the impending danger from the swimmers. Surprisingly, though, the rubber sharks created for the film look fantastic, and easily compare with any of the models used in the JAWS series. Casper Van Dien stars alongside Ernie Hudson and other D-list actors, each of whom play in to the archetypal comic book characters and writing. The pedestrian plot remains watchable enough while the viewer patiently awaits the next kill, but the near-bloodless shark attacks inevitably disappoint.
