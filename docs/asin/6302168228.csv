He is stubborn, intimidating and determined to have his way even at the expense of harming his family and friends. This Irishman has a hold over his village that none can resist until he is challenged by the sale of his land.A powerful performance is given by Richard Harris as an old man whose love for a field borders on insanity. Neither the law or church can stand in his way to own what is rightfully his. This movie is filled with various themes. You see the confrontation of a man of the soil against modern progress. You witness the church in conflict with a pagan law of the land that oversteps the bounds of Christianity. Finally you see a young man attempting to be himself only to be dominated by his father.The brutal tragedy of this story is in the guilt and misplaced love and loyalties of the main character, his family and the village. All come crumbling down through the acts of a determined madman. Your emotions will be torn in sympathy with Bull who has worked all of his life for the land. Unfortunately his insane attitude causes you to wonder if indeed his cause is just.Richard Harris was superb.

The acting was incredibly well done & it was interesting to see how many of the actors I recognized from other works (Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc). The scenery was fantastic & initially the plot was interesting to me. Unfortunately the second half of the movie just didn't grab me like the first half did.The basic story is that Bull McCabe wants to purchase a local field so his remaining son Tadgh can inherit the land. His son seems to rebel against the idea of living up to his father's expectations, especially after his older brother committed suicide & Tadgh has become the sole focus of Bull's attentions. Meanwhile the son of a villager who had immigrated during the famine to America has returned, with plans to purchase the field for his own ends. The pair clash with Tadgh getting caught in the middle as they move towards a fiery confrontation.I did like this film for the most part & the film wrenched more than a few emotions out of my mother & I. It's just that after the plot shifts after a certain important plot element (those who have seen the film know what I'm referring to), the movie just seemed to drag a little. The ending of the film was fantastically sad, but I couldn't help but feel like the film could have been shortened by 10-20 minutes.Still, this is a film that I recommend people watch if they want to experience the full scope of Richard Harris' acting abilities or if they are in the mood for a tragedy. It's not something that I'd buy or even watch again, but I'm glad that I watched it at least once.

It obviously isn't Kansas. As it turns out, Tadgh had killed the donkey when it broke down a wall and trespassed into the McCabe's field, a three-acre piece of pasture that Bull (and his forebears before him) have toiled over. The seaweed is used as fertilizer. After so many decades of sweat, the elder McCabe is convinced that the land is rightly his, though he pays monthly rent to an Englishwoman for the privilege of working it. Trouble erupts when the owner decides to sell THE FIELD to the highest bidder.The film has good intentions as it attempts to illustrate the pitfalls of identifying too closely with a piece of ground rather than just letting it go when some developer expresses an interest. In this case, the evil land grabber is a rich Irish-American (Tom Berenger), who's returning to the country of his roots. He wants to pave over Bull's field and make it a staging point for a quarry. (Consider some of the lands in dispute in today's world and imagine what nice parking lots they'd make for a new Wal-Mart.)THE FIELD is set after the English were chased from the Irish Republic, but before WWII. Harris is first rate as the old fighter who's not about to give up now despite other festering problems. McCabe's wife Maggie hasn't talked to him in eighteen years, apparently since their first-born son committed suicide, itself a millstone around Bull's neck. McCabe senior is now left with Tadgh, not the brightest bulb in the pub sign, who's not interested in inheriting Old dad's crummy lot anyhow and just wants to run off with a Gypsy temptress.THE FIELD is a dreary piece enlivened only by Richard's performance and that of John Hurt as &quot;Bird&quot; O'Donnell, evidently one of Bull's hired hands, who serves as either a catalyst of trouble or silent observer of events as the plot dictates. Berenger is non-descript as the rapacious Yank, and Bean's Tadgh is totally unengaging. Even Maggie's first words to Bull after the long dry spell are curiously lacking in profundity.Filmed entirely in Ireland, there's something to be said for the land's austere beauty as captured by the lens. However, by the end credits, I just didn't care about THE FIELD, its walls, its sheep, its cattle, its seaweed, and its crazy renter.

298970,A1H6P9THIMDJOS,6302168228,"kristin724 ""kristin724""","[2, 3]","I stumbled upon The Field through a six degrees game on the imdb. The 1990 film based upon the play by John B. Keane stars Richard Harris, Sean Bean, and Tom Berenger, but The Field is more than a connecting degree. Stunning Irish landscapes, potent performances, and bittersweet storylines make The Field a delightful little film.Bull McCabe (Richard Harris) and his son Tadgh (Sean Bean) are proud Irishmen who rent the field from the Widow (Frances Tomelty) They till the land with fertilizing seaweed and graze their animals on the field, but after years of being terrorized by Tadgh, The Widow decides to sell the field at a public auction. None of the townsfolk will dare bid against Bull, and he uses the town idiot Bird (John Heard) in his intimidation plans. Newly arrived Irish American developer (Tom Berenger) wants the field for a new roadway, and unfortunately, he doesn't take Bull threats to heart.As refreshing as it is to see Sean Bean (Patriot Games, The Fellowship of The Ring) in a non villainous role, Richard Harris owns The Field. His Oscar nominated performance alone was worth the DVD purchase. Bull McCabe is just that, a bullheaded old school man who despises the English and those who couldn't keep their land during the potato famine. Bull and his wife haven't spoken to each other since their eldest son died 15 years prior, and Harris is superb at balancing the hardened laborer with the tortured father. When the pressure of purchasing the field under legal means becomes too much, Bull is willing to sacrifice himself, what's left of his family, and anyone else who stands in his way.As stellar as Harris' performance is, the role would be diminished without worthy support. Bean is admirable as the tormented Tadgh. He's young, not the brightest bulb, and not all that interested in the field-which puts him in direct conflict with Bull. The Elephant Man star John Hurt is unrecognizable at Bird. He puts on the town idiot role inside and out-the tattered looks, stuttering, and do-anything-for-a- drink style is a sad representation of what happens to those who lost their livelihood during the famine. As much as Bull genuinely likes Bird, he's not above manipulating him into his devious plans. Richard Harris may be the star, but each character in the field brings his or her element of tragedy.Little seen in the U.S. upon its release, The Field has another ace the hole. The on Location Irish filming is a character unto itself. Briefly, you can understand Tom Berenger's want to change this small tight nit Irish community. If it weren't for his fancy car, you could swear The Field takes place in the 19th century. Horse draw carriages, no roads to speak of, thatched roof homes- the juxtaposition of this aging, strapped community against lush green and fertile land, stunning cliffscapes, and quaint Irish ways adds surprising depth to a film based on a play. These exceptional visual layers, however, can't cover the thinness of the play turned movie. As bittersweet as the story is, some of its mystery elements are in fact too obvious to a film audience. The chain of events is a likely one, but the performances make the watch worthwhile.Today's American audiences might also find The Field slow or poorly directed. Naturally there's no effects to speak of, and perhaps more monologues than we're used to. With little action, there's no need to move the camera either. Director's slow zooming, following shots, or vast panoramas are meant to capture the scope of the region and the inner complexities of the characters. It's not overtly art house styled, but viewers looking for something fast paced won't find it in The Field.Perhaps not commonly available at most retailers, The Field is more affordable at online purchasers. The DVD has no features beyond the film. I would have preferred a play to screen documentary and cast commentaries, but the film speaks for itself. Fans of Irish films and any of the actors involved should not miss The Field. Likewise classic film buffs or old school studies shouldn't miss the tragic tale.

298971,A319KYEIAZ3SON,6302168228,Mary Whipple,"[1, 2]","Though this film, directed by Jim Sheridan, is based on the stage play of the same name by John B. Keane, it bears little resemblance to the play.  The play emphasizes the passion of a Kerry farmer for his land, the measures he takes to protect it, and the willingness of the community to support him, evading both the law and the church to achieve ""true"" justice.  Big Bull McCabe, fighting to buy land he has leased and improved for ten years, is portrayed as embodying the attitudes of the whole Kerry farming culture and not as a completely unique individual with unique problems.The film, however, changes the emphasis, introducing many new elements for their visual effects.  Bull McCabe (passionately played by Richard Harris) must outbid a crass American (not an Englishman) for the field.  The dandified American (Tom Berenger) wants to use the limestone in the hills to create a cement factory (not to build a home for his Irish wife) and to use the nearby waterfall for a hydroelectric plant.  Widow Maggie Butler (Frances Tomelty) is selling the land because she is tired of her harrassment by Bull's son Tadgh (Sean Bean) and his friends (a new, illustrated subplot).  Bird O'Donnell, a nearly toothless and somewhat daft stereotype (John Hurt) is a gawping comic foil for the passion of McCabe here.Traditional, folksy dances and community activities, the developing love story of Tadgh and a gypsy girl, the close friendship between the American buyer and the pompous local priest (Sean McGinley), the death of McCabe's other son many years before, and the involvement of McCabe's wife in the film's resolution are all new, visual plot elements, and the ending is totally different, both in the way the action is ""resolved"" and in its thematic message.Spectacular cinematography (Jack Conroy)--fog, wind, cliffs, and rain--emphasizes the greatness of the land and the relative smallness of man, while the simple music (Elmer Bernstein) adds to the mood and highlights the dramatic action.  Dialogue, often limited to cryptic comments, is subordinated to visual information, and the pub characters, including the pub owner, a major character in the play, are almost interchangeable in their stereotypes.  Symbolism is obvious, from Bull's blowing of a dandelion to illustrate ""what we'd be without the land,"" to his crucifixion pose near the end of the film.  The stark realism of the play and the power of the ""us vs. them"" community dynamic get lost with the film's personal focus on Bull McCabe--and its melodrama.

298973,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,6302168228,Mr. Cairene,"[8, 19]","Somewhere amidst the perfection of 1989's My Left Foot and the frenzied energy of 1993's In The Name of The Father director Jim Sheridan had a  brief flirtation with mediocrity in this drab Irish saga. Failing as an  allegory and a docudrama, The Field is finally a film at odds with  itself.The time is 1920s Ireland where Bull McCabe(Richard Harris)  works the land his father and his father's father had worked  before him.  By his side is his obedient somewhat dim son Tadgh(Sean Bean) and a  slithery right hand man named Bird(John Hurt) who also happens to be a  little dim. Together Tadgh and Bird will justify the old man's stubbornness  with their mindless support.When the English widow who owns the land  on which the McCabe family has been toiling for decades decides to sell it,  Bull is only to happy to spend his life savings to finally own what he  feels to be rightfully his. In a film of many symbols, the most obvious  here is the proud Irishman's refusal to let the English who starved and  killed them own their land. Alas, an Irish American(Tom Berenger) has come  to find his roots(or something) and decides that he must have this  particular field at any price. Berenger is given all of four lines to  explain his ache for the field, something along the lines of &quot;When my  father died, I had to come back&quot;.A fable is by definition an  unrealistic story set to convey a moral message. If The Field purports to  be one, where is the sensual beauty that permeates these morality plays? If  it's a realistic docu-drama, why is it that I can see the Lear like fate  McCabe one hour before the film does? This is a movie with a thoroughly  confused tone. Yet Harris's rightly Oscar nominated performance is  undeniably great. With his chin down to his chest, his eyes bulging and his  hands shaking in rage he spouts out his lines between heavy fumes of  breath. But in the greatness of his performance there is a curious paradox.  This stubborn unrelenting man who defends his right to the land as if it  were his very soul is given the best lines, the most admiring closups.  While the forces of reasons, the forces that oppose him are pale and  lifeless. Never is this more clear then in what is ironically the film's  most affecting scene: As McCabe stands infront of the local Catholic  priest(who has now become quite chummy with the Yank) he movingly recounts  how he and his father starved, bled and strained on this field and thus as  a local deserves to own it. The priest's quite sensible response is  &quot;Why don't you find another field?&quot;. But it's such a colorless  response uttered by a marginal character that it pales next to McCabes  speech. Here Sheridan is commanding the audience to side with McCabe. I  never felt much sympathy for McCabe's quest. Just Pity.There are many  reasons why people watch tragedies. I guess there is the compassion a  viewer feels for his fellow man that maybe saddening but heartfelt. More  importantly there is the character's reaction to the tragedy that provides  the lesson, and possibly redemption. It is never in any doubt that McCabe's  uncompromising ways will come back to haunt him. There are three broad  outlines along which he could react to the inevitable fallout:1)He  could continue in his bigotry and refuse to acknowledge his responsibility,  which ofcourse would require the director to come up with an original way  to make his point.2)He could face up to his actions, re-evaluate his  principles and attempt to redeem himself.3)Go Insane, which ofcourse  is the ultimate cop-out.

Having grown up in the south of Ireland, he simply played himself in the film, or at least that's my guess. For a comparable reflection of local culture in a film, one would have to turn to Robert Duvall's also incomparable portrayals of Texans. The ending is ""King Knut"", but that tale of his beating the waves is misinterpreted, Knut (and The Bull as well) was not a fool.He killed the Yank. Well, he should have killed the priest too. Oh, not really, murder isn't the answer but they both deserved a good, swift kick in the rear end and to be stopped as well. I was told in Ireland that the case is realistic, that disputes over land could easily lead to murder.

Keane, Director Jim Sheridan presents a gripping tale that is rich with Irish tradition and history in the film THE FIELD.  Legendary actor, Richard Harris (Bull McCabe) plays a stubborn farmer who treasures the land he has cultivated, and forcefully and close to manically guards the land when he finds out that an American or as Bull refers to him, ""Yank"", played by Tom Berenger, suddenly appears to buy the land from the original landowner, Maggie Butler (Frances Tomelty); all tensions ensue.THE FIELD brazens the Irish past, which includes its religious, social and class struggles and the unfortunate Irish famine.  These issues come crashing down as the film plot thickens especially during the climax.  The story revolves around Bull McCabe, a man who has carried the guilt and bitterness of the past, the death of one of his sons, Shamus, and his present burdens that exist with his only son, Tadgh (Sean Bean), who along with his cohort Bird O'Donnell played by John Hurt, exert unkind and child-like deeds toward Butler forcing her to sell her land.The entire of production of the film is outstanding.  Director of photography, Jack Conroy captures the beautiful mountainous and seashore landscape, which complement each dramatic scene.  Jim Sheridan and Steve Morrison do a fine job in adapting Keane's play to film, and the story and its characters come alive with their production.THE FIELD is tremendously moving.

Harris is a brutal, hardworking man whose energies have been devoted to the clearing and nurturing of a field.  It was his family's way of surviving the devastation that followed the potato famine, which makes him feel entitled to it in spite of the fact that he doesn't own it.  He pays rent to an English woman who has long submitted to the harassment by Harris' poorly equipped son, played brilliantly by Sean Bean.  When he stands to lose the land, Harris goes crazy, assuring first the complicity of his bitter compatriots and then committing a crime that will shatter not just the community but destroy his family.  The church - offering a mixture of moral condemnation and conservative self-righteousness - cannot help.  Meanwhile, the son is attempting to go his own way with a woman his father despises.The tragedy is devastating and completely convincing, the kind of depressing spectacle that you would expect from Bergman, but in Ireland of the 1930s.

298983,AY3AVLL5IWW9,6302168228,Russell Fanelli,"[181, 186]","In order to understand Jim Sheridan's fine film, The Field, based on the play by the same name by J.B. Keane, it is useful to know some of the Irish history that relates directly to this tragic story.A little less than 800 years ago the English first came to Ireland and initiated a slow but steady conquest of the island and people. By the 19th century the catholic Irish had lost most of their land and their freedom to the protestant English. The great Irish statesman Daniel O'Connell made modest progress in winning some liberty for the Irish catholics in the early part of the 19th century. Unfortunately, the Great Famine, which began in 1845 and lasted until 1848, killed a million or more Irish people who were dependent on the potato, which suffered from a disastrous blight.  Two million more people fled the island to foreign shores, America being one preferred destination.  A population of approximately eight million people was reduced by about 36%.  The Irish never forgave the English for allowing this great tragedy to occur.  The ill effects of this disaster lasted well into the 20th century.In the film The Field, ""The Bull"" McCabe (Richard Harris), a tenant farmer in a small town in southwestern Ireland, mentions the famine and its after effects several times to justify his right to buy the field that he and his family have given their love and labor for generations.  The English woman who owns the field has put her property up for auction and an American, Tom Berrenger, appears ready to outbid McCabe for the field.  McCabe will not permit what he perceives to be a miscarriage of justice.Against him are the American and his ally, the local parish priest.  McCabe does his best to reason with these men and explain why he feels he has a right to the field.  McCabe mentions the Great Famine and the sacrifice his family made to remain in Ireland to rebuild a devastated society.  This field represented not only McCabe's life, but life for his posterity.  The priest and the ""Yank"" are unmoved by his arguments so McCabe takes the law into his own hands with disastrous consequences for him, his wife, and his son.This fine film gives us a chance to learn much about the Irish people and their culture.  The importance of the land, the power of religion, the hatred of the English, the poverty of the people, and the loss of Irish youth to emigration are just of few of the themes touched on as the story develops.The Field was made in Ireland and the beauty of the land is everywhere evident, in stark contrast to the meanness of the lives of the people who live there.  We don't need to be Irish to be moved by the desperation of McCabe and people like him trying to eke out a living by their unremmiting labor.The Field is less an entertainment and more an education for those people wanting to gain some insight into the lives of the Irish farmers living in the first half of the 20th Century.  I have watched this film several times with great interest as well as appreciation for Jim Sheridan's fine work.

It was made from the well-known and -loved play of the same name by John B. Keane, who was a small-town publican in Co. Kerry, and evidently paid very close attention to what was going on around him.  It's based on a true story about a bitter land dispute between a local man, ""The Bull McCabe,"" played by noted Irish actor Richard Harris,who collected an Oscar nomination for his performance; and ""The Yank,"" played by Tom Beringer.  John Hurt also had a starring role, playing ""Bird O'Donnell,""the sort of part that the older English actor John Mills had made his own, the wily village idiot.The movie was filmed not in Co. Kerry, but in Co. Mayo, in the village of Leenane.  Its sets still stand: so happens I've just been and seen them.  Anyway, never mind the change of county, the movie, with cinematography by Jack Conroy, still gives you a very good idea of the Irish countryside: constantly threatened by an angry sea, generally cool, rainy and overcast, muddy, with deep black cold lakes and rivers. The film's set in the earlier 20th century: clothes, houses and vehicles appear to be accurately rendered, as does the dreary lives most of its characters were forced to live.  The excellent musical score is the work of Hollywood favorite Elmer Bernstein. ""The Field"" functions as a corrective to John Ford's misty-eyed movieThe Quiet Man (Collector's Edition), that starred John Wayne.  The Ford picture shows us the American, Wayne, coming into a small Irish village, and, after a bit of blather, being welcomed.  Sheridan's picture emphatically does not.  It casts a cold eye back at the terrible 19th Century Famine, and examines the land hunger of the people who remained.For whatever reason, there's lots of Soviet socialist realism school silhouetting against the big sky. Harris's high-powered performance dominates the film.  Mind you, some would say too high-powered, that Harris, possibly with Shakespeare's King Lear in mind, leaves no blade of grass unchewed on that field.  Hurt, too, does strong work, as does the supporting  cast.  Sean Bean is Tadgh, McCabe's handsome son.  Brenda Fricker, possibly with Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth in mind, is the luckless Mrs. McCabe, to whom her husband hasn't spoken for sixteen years.  Sean McGinly turns in good work as the village priest.  Such standbys as Brendan Gleeson, Ruth McCabe, and Malachy McCourt also take small parts.  The movie is realistic, and devoid of sentimentality, not for those who prefer their Irish movies cozy.  But it's engrossing, if you don't find Harris's performance too much.",4,"Harris Gives Powerful, Perhaps Too Powerful Performance",1200009600,"01 11, 2008",2008,2727,"['Field', '1990', 'Irish', 'movie', 'was', 'second', 'be', 'made', 'talented', 'Irish', 'director', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'who', 'also', 'screenwriting', 'credit', 'was', 'made', 'well-known', '-loved', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'John', 'B.', 'Keane', 'who', 'was', 'small-town', 'publican', 'Co.', 'Kerry', 'evidently', 'paid', 'very', 'close', 'attention', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'bitter', 'land', 'dispute', 'local', 'man', 'Bull', 'McCabe', 'played', 'noted', 'Irish', 'actor', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'who', 'collected', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'Yank', 'played', 'Tom', 'Beringer', 'John', 'Hurt', 'also', 'had', 'starring', 'role', 'playing', 'Bird', ""O'Donnell"", 'sort', 'part', 'older', 'English', 'actor', 'John', 'Mills', 'had', 'made', 'own', 'wily', 'village', 'idiot.The', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'not', 'Co.', 'Kerry', 'Co.', 'Mayo', 'village', 'Leenane', 'sets', 'still', 'stand', 'so', ""'ve"", 'just', 'been', 'seen', 'Anyway', 'never', 'change', 'county', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'Jack', 'Conroy', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'Irish', 'countryside', 'constantly', 'threatened', 'angry', 'sea', 'generally', 'cool', 'rainy', 'overcast', 'muddy', 'deep', 'black', 'cold', 'lakes', 'rivers', 'film', 'set', 'earlier', '20th', 'century', 'clothes', 'houses', 'vehicles', 'appear', 'be', 'accurately', 'rendered', 'dreary', 'most', 'characters', 'were', 'forced', 'live', 'excellent', 'musical', 'score', 'work', 'Hollywood', 'favorite', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'Field', 'functions', 'corrective', 'John', 'Ford', 'misty-eyed', 'movieThe', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'starred', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Ford', 'picture', 'American', 'Wayne', 'coming', 'small', 'Irish', 'village', 'bit', 'blather', 'being', 'welcomed', 'Sheridan', 'picture', 'emphatically', 'not', 'cold', 'eye', 'back', 'terrible', '19th', 'Century', 'Famine', 'land', 'hunger', 'people', 'who', 'remained.For', 'reason', 'lots', 'Soviet', 'socialist', 'realism', 'school', 'silhouetting', 'big', 'sky', 'Harris', 'high-powered', 'performance', 'film', 'Mind', 'would', 'say', 'too', 'high-powered', 'Harris', 'possibly', 'Shakespeare', 'King', 'Lear', 'mind', 'blade', 'grass', 'unchewed', 'field', 'Hurt', 'too', 'strong', 'work', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Tadgh', 'McCabe', 'handsome', 'son', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'possibly', 'Shakespeare', 'Lady', 'Macbeth', 'mind', 'luckless', 'Mrs.', 'McCabe', 'whom', 'husband', ""n't"", 'spoken', 'sixteen', 'years', 'Sean', 'McGinly', 'good', 'work', 'village', 'priest', 'Such', 'standbys', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Ruth', 'McCabe', 'Malachy', 'McCourt', 'also', 'take', 'small', 'parts', 'movie', 'realistic', 'devoid', 'sentimentality', 'not', 'who', 'prefer', 'Irish', 'movies', 'cozy', 'engrossing', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'Harris', 'performance', 'too', 'much']",N/A

For as long as he can remember, Bull McCabe has cultured and cared for a small three-acre field near his home in western Ireland.  But after so many years of hard work, the owner is selling the field, much of her reasoning is to spite Bull. Everything seems to go fine because Bull has enough money to purchase the land he loves so much, but at the auction an American arrives prepared to pay whatever it takes to outbid Bull.  That's the movie in a nutshell, but there's really a lot more going on.  Subplots cross paths throughout and several characters' troubled histories come out.  It's a moving story that keeps unravelling as it develops, and it all builds to a powerful and very surprising ending.  Not a hugely well-known movie, but it's well worth your time to check out The Field.In a career that featured many great performances, this may be Richard Harris' best part.  Harris plays Bull McCabe, an old Irishman intent on keeping his land no matter what it takes or what sacrifices need to be made.  McCabe has a dark, troubled path which Harris pulls off nicely, slowly opening up about his motivations and reasoning.  Sean Bean is very good as Tadgh, Bull's son who wants to live up to his father's expectations but be his own man at the same time.  John Hurt plays Bird O'Connell, the village idiot of sorts who is close friends with Bull through thick and thin.  Tom Berenger is good in a small but integral part as Peter, the American who has bigger plans for the Irish countryside Bull loves so much.  The rest of the strong cast includes Brenda Fricker as Maggie, Bull's wife, Sean McGinley as Father Doran, a priest who locks horns with Bull, and Jenny Conroy as Kate, a poor girl looked down upon by almost all of the village.The DVD has the movie in a decent looking widescreen presentation. It'd be hard to mess the movie up in that department with the beautiful Irish locations.  No special features, not even a trailer, are offered.  Something would have been nice, but the movie is strong enough to stand on its own.  Don't miss this one if for nothing else than to see Richard Harris' performance, give The Field a try!",4,A moving story with great performance from Richard Harris,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,2266,"['Based', 'play', 'John', 'B.', 'Keane', 'Fiels', 'moving', 'story', 'flown', 'radar', 'release', '1990', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'remember', 'Bull', 'McCabe', 'cultured', 'cared', 'small', 'three-acre', 'field', 'home', 'western', 'Ireland', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'hard', 'work', 'owner', 'selling', 'field', 'much', 'reasoning', 'spite', 'Bull', 'Everything', 'go', 'fine', 'Bull', 'enough', 'money', 'purchase', 'land', 'so', 'much', 'auction', 'American', 'arrives', 'prepared', 'pay', 'outbid', 'Bull', 'movie', 'nutshell', 'really', 'lot', 'more', 'going', 'Subplots', 'cross', 'paths', 'several', 'characters', 'troubled', 'histories', 'come', 'out', 'moving', 'story', 'unravelling', 'builds', 'powerful', 'very', 'surprising', 'ending', 'Not', 'hugely', 'well-known', 'movie', 'well', 'time', 'check', 'out', 'Field.In', 'career', 'featured', 'many', 'great', 'performances', 'may', 'be', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'best', 'part', 'Harris', 'Bull', 'McCabe', 'old', 'Irishman', 'intent', 'keeping', 'land', 'matter', 'what', 'what', 'sacrifices', 'need', 'be', 'made', 'McCabe', 'dark', 'troubled', 'path', 'Harris', 'nicely', 'slowly', 'opening', 'up', 'motivations', 'reasoning', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'very', 'good', 'Tadgh', 'Bull', 'son', 'who', 'live', 'up', 'father', 'expectations', 'be', 'own', 'man', 'same', 'time', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Bird', ""O'Connell"", 'village', 'idiot', 'sorts', 'who', 'close', 'friends', 'Bull', 'thick', 'thin', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'good', 'small', 'integral', 'part', 'Peter', 'American', 'who', 'bigger', 'plans', 'Irish', 'countryside', 'Bull', 'so', 'much', 'rest', 'strong', 'cast', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'Maggie', 'Bull', 'wife', 'Sean', 'McGinley', 'Father', 'Doran', 'priest', 'who', 'horns', 'Bull', 'Jenny', 'Conroy', 'Kate', 'poor', 'girl', 'looked', 'down', 'upon', 'almost', 'village.The', 'DVD', 'movie', 'decent', 'looking', 'widescreen', 'presentation', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard', 'mess', 'movie', 'up', 'department', 'beautiful', 'Irish', 'locations', 'special', 'features', 'not', 'even', 'trailer', 'are', 'offered', 'Something', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'movie', 'strong', 'enough', 'stand', 'own', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one', 'nothing', 'else', 'see', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'performance', 'give', 'Field', 'try']",N/A

With Richard Harris finding enormous, brilliant energy in his role as the doomed main character, it goes beyond depressing to being scorchingly, searingly upsetting.  It's bleak, harrowing, dismal and severely gut-wrenching.  If that's your kind of thing, this movie delivers it in spades, way more forcefully than the next ten downer flicks put together.I saw it on cable and walked out before the final, awful ending.  My wife sat through the whole miserable story and confirmed that the ending was even heartrending than the rest of the movie.Two stars because of the acting, otherwise zero stars.
