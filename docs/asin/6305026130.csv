This movie has really nothing to do with Jackie Chan.  He plays some back drop bad guy with a huge mold on his face.  You do not see any great fighting moves at all.  Here is another things, why is this move called ""Young Tiger""?  It should be called a female cop and a taxi driver.  A guy who plays the taxi driver and a female playing cop are the lead actors in this move.  None of their characters are memorable, and their fighting moves does not impress.

BUT WHEN SHE DIES IN A TAXICAB ON THE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL, THE CABDRIVER BECOMES A TARGET OF THE GANG, WHO THINKS HE HAS THE GIRL'S PURSE. THIS IS VERY MEDIOCRE FOR A JACKIE CHAN MOVIE. THE STORY IS DUMB, THE SCRIPT IS WACK, AND MOST OF THE FIGHTS ARE LUDICROUS. THOUGH JACKIE CHAN IS ON THE COVER OF THIS MOVIE, HE DOESN'T REALLY DO MUCH. THE ONE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS FILM IS THE FACT THAT WE FINALLY GET TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SEE CHAN AS A VILLAIN. WANT A BETTER JACKIE CHAN MOVIE FROM THE EARLIER DAYS?

The acting is bad, the fights are mediocre, the dubbing is bad, and the focusing is terrible.  It is almost like an amateur with a camcorder woke up one day and decided to make a movie.
