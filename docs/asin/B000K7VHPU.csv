Much like `The Prestige,' it is a magician's movie that requires the audience to keep their eyes on the subject.  This time the titled `illusionist,' Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is at the top of his form, but instead of wanting fame and fortune like the magicians in `The Prestige,' he keeps his eyes on the duchess, the love interest of the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell).  At one point his fame gets him invited to an affair held by the Crown Prince, himself, and Eisenheim provides a trick to pull up the Prince's sword, much like the child with the pure heart does in the medieval fable.  He succeeds, but not without some doubts.  His embarrassment at this awkward moment creates a rivalry with `the illusionist'.  Supported by the chief inspector (Paul Giamatti), Eisenheim has just enough time to conjure a brazen love affair with the duchess.  But a drunken confrontation between the Prince and his unfaithful fianc&eacute; provides tragedy, one that seems to only be answered by a different venue on the illusionist's stage.  The Prince's jealous rage has him figuratively putting a noose around Eisenheim, one from which he must escape.While `The Prestige' benefits from Christopher Nolan's modern direction with a progressively dark appeal, `The Illusionist' has time-honored filmmaking with appeal that delivers its magic with greater resolution (from director, Neil Burger).  Both movies are excellent and are edited with precision, but while `The Prestige' is masterful at development; `The Illusionist' wins in a matchup.",5,'The Illusionist' Conjures Delightful Magic,1163980800,"11 20, 2006",2006,1593,"['Illusionist', 'great', 'old-fashioned', 'fun', 'Much', 'Prestige', 'magician', 'movie', 'audience', 'keep', 'eyes', 'subject', 'time', 'titled', 'illusionist', 'Eisenheim', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'top', 'form', 'instead', 'wanting', 'fame', 'fortune', 'magicians', 'Prestige', 'eyes', 'duchess', 'love', 'interest', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'one', 'point', 'fame', 'invited', 'affair', 'held', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Eisenheim', 'trick', 'pull', 'up', 'Prince', 'sword', 'much', 'child', 'pure', 'heart', 'medieval', 'fable', 'not', 'doubts', 'embarrassment', 'awkward', 'moment', 'rivalry', 'illusionist', 'Supported', 'chief', 'inspector', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Eisenheim', 'just', 'enough', 'time', 'conjure', 'brazen', 'love', 'affair', 'duchess', 'drunken', 'confrontation', 'Prince', 'unfaithful', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'tragedy', 'one', 'only', 'be', 'answered', 'different', 'venue', 'illusionist', 'stage', 'Prince', 'jealous', 'rage', 'figuratively', 'putting', 'noose', 'Eisenheim', 'one', 'must', 'escape.While', 'Prestige', 'benefits', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'modern', 'direction', 'progressively', 'dark', 'appeal', 'Illusionist', 'time-honored', 'filmmaking', 'appeal', 'magic', 'greater', 'resolution', 'director', 'Neil', 'Burger', 'movies', 'are', 'excellent', 'are', 'edited', 'precision', 'Prestige', 'masterful', 'development', 'Illusionist', 'wins', 'matchup']",N/A

It's a great family movie, a little formulaic and has been done before, but very fresh and well done.  When I saw Edward Norton I thought I might not like it, not that he is a poor actor (on the contrary, I think he's very talented) but this didn't seem his ""kind"" of movie.  Boy was I ever wrong, he does a great job with it, but the character of Eisenheim fits in well with his seemingly ""real"" personality...the soft-spoken, intelligent illusionist.  Also features Rufus Sewell as the ""bad guy"" Prinz Leopold, and I think Sewell is one of the most under-rated actors in Hollywood.  Why doesn't this guy do more stuff?  Top it all off with Jessica Biehl who I've NEVER seen do a poor job in ANYTHING she's been in, and it helps I think she's also a knock-out!  This movie is very, very well-acted, all around.  The setting and scenery are great, and I didn't even mind that it took place in Austria and they were all speaking English, one thing that usually peeves me and can remove me from the story quicker than anything else.

It's refreshing to see a movie that is a joy to watch because of excellent direction, beautiful cinematography, wonderful acting, and a compelling story. And it's an adult movie too, with grownup actors behaving like grownups. Not a single teenager in the whole film. How wonderful to not be bombarded with immature hardbodies and ridiculous amounts of unconvincing computer effects.One major issue I have, though, is with some major plot holes in the script. The trick performed at the Prince's mansion with a sword the sticks to the floor is never explained, and I honestly can't imagine an explanation that would make sense. A strong magnet attached to the ceiling of the room below, removed at the last minute by an accomplice? This might work, but the prince and his staff would have had to have been in on it, which obviously isn't the case.Also, and this is a major problem, (SPOILER ALERT) since the ghosts that Eisenheim contacts end up not being ghosts at all, how could he possibly be performing these tricks? it would be one thing if these ""apparitions"" were limited to the stage, but one of them walks through the theatre, past the police chief (who runs his hand through the ""ghost""), and onto the stage. This could not possibly be a film projection. What explanation could there possibly be? None that I know of, and none is provided.Still, despite these issues, and the fact that I was not much surprised by the surprise ending, this film is an absolute joy.

They are separated and they spend years without seeing each other. One night, Eisenheim is onstage performing an illusion and requires someone from the crowd to assist him. To his great surprise, Sophie climbs onstage but she doesn't recognize him at first. Eisenheim learns that she is engaged to a prince who has a reputation for not being the nicest man around women. Something will happen that will change the course of things and will put Eisenheim against the prince and his trusty inspector.The Illusionist is certainly one of 2006's best films. I went in to see this movie not knowing what to expect -- having stopped myself from seeing any trailers or TV spots. It's a wonderful film that pulls you in from the first frame. The cinematography is beautiful and the score haunting. Norton, Biel, and Giamatti all give stellar performances.This was director Neil Burger's second film; his first being Interview with the Assassin, a mockumentary on the Kennedy assassination which I have yet to see. I'm curious as what he'll do next; his screenwriting and directing skills impressed me with The Illusionist.This is the kind of film which I can safely say will appeal to almost anyone.

1032178,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000K7VHPU,Alistair McHarg,"[2, 3]","The Illusionist (horrible title!) is a wonderful movie to watch, which makes sense, because it's all about visual illusion, and nobody does visual illusion quite like Hollywood.  From the theatre to the palace, the costumes to the cobblestone streets, carriages, and buildings, the sense of place is compelling - excellent cinematography.  (Norton seems unsure about what sort of accent he is trying to pull off, but for the most part, even the diction and affect of the actors contribute.)The basic story, to say nothing of the dialogue! - is pretty boilerplate, a boy meets girl set-up with a royal court intrigue backdrop.  That's okay because the protagonists are likeable and the villain is really nasty - Giamatti is excellent as the guy in the middle.  Where the film gets into trouble is with its depiction of magic.  Norton - a terrific actor who struggles with unremarkable looks - has been made up well, he's almost dashing.  At times, when he is conjuring, Norton almost seems to have that Svengali dark power of magic, which can be turned to evil purposes at will.I was reminded of a much better movie, The Magician, by Ingmar Bergman.  It was clear in that film that magic, and magicians, emanated from a dark place and were not to be trifled with.  Our Ed, by contrast, has wandered the globe living for years in the Orient and still retains his affable, kid next-door persona - summoning spirits for stunned audiences as casually as you or I would use the phone to summon pizza delivered to our door.  This is one of many ways this picture cheats you.  Is he merely an entertainer, or is there sinister purpose to his shows?  Maybe he just likes being on stage.Bergman's The Magician ends with a chirpy twist which seems to belie everything that came before it, the deus ex machina for which magicians are famous.  It's a deliberate sleight of hand.  The ending of The Illusionist also comes with a twist, but it fails.  Instead of running in contrast to what's come before, it is designed to explain and justify ""the show.""  In this regard it is incredibly cheap and flabby - like watching playing cards fall from a magician's sleeve as bunnies hop around the stage.  Jessica Biel is exquisite, Rufus Sewell is an excellent baddy, and the antler hallway alone is worth the price of admission.  But don't be tricked into thinking it's anything more than what it is - a nice show.",4,"It's A Film!  It's An Illusion!

It flows gracefully through to the last second.The movie begins as Vienna's Chief Police Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) recounts the life, to date (1900) of a carpenter's son, a forbidden friend of Countess Sophie von Teschen, (Eleanor Tomlinson) for whom he carved a magic locket and with whom he had planned to flee. They were discovered and forcibly separated.The boy departed Vienna and toured exotic countries in Asia, acquiring extensive magical knowledge. He arrived home 15 years later as the performer ""Eisenheim"" (Edward Norton), and with the help of theatrical manager Josef Fischer (Edward Marsan), he immediately attracts  an enormous following. Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), determined to prove Eisenheim a fraud, attends a show arm in arm with his gorgeous fianc&eacute;e--Countess Sophie (Jesscia Biel). The Crown Prince volunteers Sophie for an elaborate stage trick. Eisenhem instantly recognizes her and pretends not to know her; Sophie realizes more slowly. Naturally, they reunite romantically.But that is far from the end of the magic, or the mystery encompassed in this engrossing film. Norton's Eisenheim characterization grabs viewers and balances equally against Biel's angelic portrayal of Sophie. Giamatti's Inspector Uhl, an ambitious, devious, outwardly crusty official controlled by the Prince, also demonstrates a weakness for magic, and beneath that layer, a tenuous warmth that slowly takes root and grows.One viewer claims the film is too long on time and too short on romance. I disagree. The level of intrigue was exactly perfect for a film of this kind, enough to draw us in, but not so much as to detract from the other, far more magical aspects of the story.This film is a crowd-pleaser--pure magic.--Alyssa A.

In fact, this is one of the better achievements in the year that was 2006, a year that was so rich with film and yet seems so underappreciated (yes, Martin Scorsese finally won his Oscar, but `The Departed' represents some of the more middlebrow, overrated fare the year had to offer).`The Illusionist' is beyond intoxicating.The film tells the story of undying love.  Set in Vienna, the story centers on renowned illusionist Eisenheim.  Growing up poor and essentially banned from seeing the love of his youth, Duchess Sophie, Eisenheim is reunited with his love 15 years later.  By this time she is betrothed to another, a violent tempered Crown Prince with ideas of ruining a nation.  Devising a plan to be together, all seems dangerous yet doable until Sophie turns up dead.Enter Chief Inspector Uhl.Thank goodness for casting directors with their thinking caps on.  Edward Norton is superb as Eisenheim, a man completely withdrawn into his own world yet confidently assertive into the lives of those around him.  He is commanding and unforgettable.  Rufus Sewell (he needs more films like this) is impressively oppressive and spine chillingly creepy and Jessica Biel defines damsel in distress with her soft lips and limber body language that beg to be embraced.  But, for me, this film is all about Paul Giamatti.  For a man who can fall, very easily, into caricature, his performance as Uhl is so astute and technically dominating that I found myself caught up in his every scene.I just loved watching him and Norton interact; like to masters prodding one another along with a slight arrogance that should complete control of the situation at hand.The film is elegantly shot, much like a piece of art, the scenes just melt off the screen and imprint themselves into the minds of the viewer.  It suffered due to being released in the same year as Christopher Nolan's equally outstanding `The Prestige', but one should not forget `The Illusionist'.  They are two very different films, despite a recurring theme (the art of the illusion is not one-note, that is for sure).  One of the best films to be nearly completely forgotten, `The Illusionist' is one you really need to see to believe; believe me!",5,Plenty of tricks up these sleeves...,1299024000,"03 2, 2011",2011,2383,"['still', 'get', 'chills', 'when', 'think', 'richly', 'detailed', 'ending', 'masterful', 'tale', 'one', 'enough', 'chills', 'thrills', 'mix', 'was', 'spellbound', 'days', 'fact', 'one', 'better', 'achievements', 'year', 'was', '2006', 'year', 'was', 'so', 'rich', 'film', 'yet', 'so', 'underappreciated', 'yes', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'finally', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Departed', 'more', 'middlebrow', 'overrated', 'fare', 'year', 'had', 'offer', 'Illusionist', 'intoxicating.The', 'film', 'story', 'undying', 'love', 'Set', 'Vienna', 'story', 'centers', 'renowned', 'illusionist', 'Eisenheim', 'Growing', 'up', 'poor', 'essentially', 'banned', 'seeing', 'love', 'youth', 'Duchess', 'Sophie', 'Eisenheim', 'reunited', 'love', '15', 'years', 'later', 'time', 'betrothed', 'violent', 'tempered', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'ideas', 'ruining', 'nation', 'Devising', 'plan', 'be', 'together', 'dangerous', 'yet', 'doable', 'Sophie', 'up', 'dead.Enter', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Uhl.Thank', 'goodness', 'casting', 'directors', 'thinking', 'caps', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'superb', 'Eisenheim', 'man', 'completely', 'withdrawn', 'own', 'world', 'yet', 'confidently', 'assertive', 'lives', 'commanding', 'unforgettable', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'more', 'films', 'impressively', 'oppressive', 'spine', 'chillingly', 'creepy', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'damsel', 'distress', 'soft', 'lips', 'limber', 'body', 'language', 'be', 'embraced', 'film', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'fall', 'very', 'easily', 'caricature', 'performance', 'Uhl', 'so', 'astute', 'technically', 'dominating', 'found', 'caught', 'up', 'scene.I', 'just', 'loved', 'watching', 'Norton', 'interact', 'masters', 'prodding', 'one', 'slight', 'arrogance', 'should', 'complete', 'control', 'situation', 'hand.The', 'film', 'elegantly', 'shot', 'much', 'piece', 'art', 'scenes', 'just', 'melt', 'off', 'screen', 'imprint', 'minds', 'viewer', 'suffered', 'due', 'being', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'equally', 'outstanding', 'Prestige', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'forget', 'Illusionist', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'films', 'recurring', 'theme', 'art', 'illusion', 'not', 'one-note', 'sure', 'One', 'best', 'films', 'be', 'nearly', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'Illusionist', 'one', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'believe', 'believe']",N/A
1032188,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B000K7VHPU,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[4, 5]","The Illusionist is the story of a young magician in 1900 Vienna.  Eisenheim (Edward Norton) bursts onto the scene and immediately captivates the entire city, gaining a sizable following, which includes the city's Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) and even the Crown Prince himself (played by Rufus Sewell).  However, Uhl eventually finds that he must arrest the magician for crimes against the empire.  Most of the movie is told by Uhl to Prince Leopold concerning his investigation into Eisenheim's life.Uhl's tale of Eisenheim's introduction to magic is an unbelievable tale of a creepy old wizard who imparts his powers onto the young boy, who is the son of a cabinet maker.  Eisenheim's father builds the furniture for the family of a dutchess.  As with many stories, the high class Dutchess Sophie (played as an adult by Jessica Biel) and the peasant Eisenheim fall for each other.  Eisenheim astounds Sophie with his magical skills, but of course, things end in tragedy.  Eisenheim disappears for years, only to return to Vienna as an adult.  Unbeknownst to him, Sophie is set to wed Prince Leopold.  The pair attend one of Eisenheim's shows after reading rave reviews about his act.  Eisenheim wows the audience by spouting philosophy that ties into his illusions.  While contemplating time, he makes a small orange tree grow within the space of 30 seconds and has butterflies carry a handkerchief across the stage.  When he asks for a volunteer who ""does not fear death"", Leopold volunteers Sophie.  While Eisenheim immediately recognizes Sophie, she does not remember him at first.  However, the pair rekindle their love affair under the nose of the Prince.Meanwhile, both Uhl and Leopold try to figure out the secrets to the illusions.  While Uhl sees it more as a good challenge, Leopold feels insulted that a man of lesser standing can outwit him.  After Eisenheim humiliates Leopold at a private party, the Prince orders Uhl to shut down the magician.What follows are two series of events by both Eisenheim and Uhl to outwit the other.  Eisenheim wants to escape Vienna with Sophie while Uhl needs to find out how his tricks work in order to arrest him for fraud.  Their paths seem to be parallel, but there may actually be a convergence point for the two rivals.The good story is augmented by strong performances from all the actors, especially Norton and Giamatti.  Norton's soft-spoken approach to the brilliant and patient illusionist perfectly compliments the angry and erratic Leopold, who serves as his rival in the love triangle with Sophie in the middle.  Giamatti's take on the police inspector who is divided between his loyalty to the Prince and his quest to pursue justice is very well done.  Biel is good, but is definitely overshadowed by the two male leads.This is film is seeing a limited release, but it is definitely worth seeing.

In a nutshell, Norton is a stage magician who excels at his craft beyond anyone's imagination; his understated demeanor adds further mystery to his magic. Giamatti is the chief inspector in Vienna who admires the illusionist and attends many of his performances; his facial expressions speak volumes. Sewell is the Crown Prince who attends one of the performances with his fianc&eacute;e, which turns out to be Norton's childhood sweetheart and the love is rekindled. The Crown Prince is a rational, progressive, though arrogant, aristocrat and sees the illusionist simply as a magician, not having any supernatural powers, as many of his entourage believes, and he wants to, though is unsuccessful, in revealing him as a charlatan; though he is supposed to be the villain in the movie, I felt myself sympathetic to him (as well as the others). A chess game ensues between the protagonists and will say no more in order not to spoil the movie for the first time viewers.The movie is curiously shot in a sepia-like lens, this gives the movie throughout an unreal look to it; it also brings to mind the old, faded, photographs of long ago which have acquired the same tint.And hey! The movie was made without a single obscenity being uttered while remaining a great movie. You think this might catch on in Hollywood? Nah.I do have one complaint.

The actual trick is both in truly seeing and in making the moment seem magical.

But she was a titled lady, and he was the son of a cabinet-maker who made furniture for her family. They were forcibly separated, but not before he gave her a locket which opened in a secret way to reveal a picture of him. Keep your eye on that locket.The Crown Prince comes to one of Eisenheim's performances, and when the illusionist calls for a volunteer who ""is not afraid of death,"" the prince volunteers Sofia. She recognizes Eisenheim as the young man she once loved, but does not reveal this to the audience. He asks ""Have we ever met?"" as part of the act, and she says no. Then he does his illusion of standing her in front of a mirror, the image in the mirror is murdered, but she is OK. Great show!Sofia is supposed to marry Crown Prince Leopold, whom she does not love. But Leopold has revealed some of his darkest secrets to her, so if she will not marry him, she must die.From there, I refuse to give away anything. You will have too much fun working it out.

Both films featured magicians at the turn of the century. Both are amazing to watch, the cinematography takes you to another world. The acting is top notch in THE PRESTIGE, but in the ILLUSIONIST, Edward Norton as the great Eisenhiem, seems very wooden and his accent is also annoying.THE PRESTIGE featured plot twists after plot twists, the movie constantly shifted and left you feeling confused at the end. THE ILLUSIONIST moves slowly, taking its time to tell its story of love. Eisenhiem and Sophie (Jessica Beil) knew each other as children, but because they were from different social classes, they could never be together. Eisenheim returns after a 15 year absence and finds Sophie is soon to be engaged to the future emperor of Austria, the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell.)Leopold doesn't want the two to be together and a confrontation ensues. Paul Giamatti plays the police inspector who has a lot to gain by shutting Eisenhiem down, but knows what an evil person Sewell's character can be. While THE PRESTIGE is a complex movie that focuses on magic and the extent magic and deception can be used to manipulate lives, THE ILLUSIONIST is really a love story with magic only coming into play occasionally.The Illusionist tells a simple story with a twist at the end. The twist didn't shock me, I saw it coming. It was believable and made the monotonous hour and a half before it that much more enjoyable.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[51, 84]","Much of a film's interest starts the moment audiences see trailers for it , and such was the case with THE ILLUSIONIST. The dark themes, nice sets, pretty actors/actresses, and supernatural undertones probably drew movie-goers to the theaters after checking out the trailers. But some may be disappointed to find little else behind The Illusionist. Although this disappointment won't fall to the level of despair or hatred of the film, movie buffs may feel as if they were lied to when it doesn't deliver the high-caliber flick they were expecting.The story ...Eisenheim the Illusionist is played by Edward Norton (AMERICAN HISTORY X), and Norton does an okay job with a scripted character that seems to have few emotions. Eisenheim's life has focused on his magical craft since he left his hometown and the love of his life, Sophie (Jessica Biel, ELIZABETHTOWN), a fellow teenager who's way above Eisenheim's station. Fifteen years later we find Eisenheim in Vienna only to discover that Sophie, now a beautiful young baroness, slated to marry into the upper echelon of royalty. Her husband-to-be is the dangerous and manipulating Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell, DARK CITY). But when Eisenheim and Sophie try to rekindle their love interest, deadly forces are at play and are ready to rip them apart again. One of these forces is Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti, CINDERELLA MAN), the upstart of a poor butcher who's trying to rise to a power all his own (Viennese Mayor Uhl? Nice ring to it, eh?).Eisenheim and Sophie concoct a plan in which she can detach herself from the Crown Prince, but the plan seems doomed from the start. Sophie's life is put in danger and Eisenheim has to use his incredible illusionist powers to help save their lives and their love. But can it work?As with the title and the main character, much of what is seen is complete illusion. But if one watches carefully, they can pick up on hints of what is truly going on. ""Make us disappear,"" Sophie pleads with Eisenheim at the beginning of the film as they cower in a hut. And that he cannot do so obviously affects the rest of his life and the rest of the film.The shinning stars in The Illusionist are Giamatti, Sewell, and, surprisingly, Biel. Although the entire focus of the film is around Norton's character, it's tough to get ""into"" him when what he mostly does is sit on a stage and make soulful apparitions appear by looking as if he were having a particularly tough bowel movement.Paul Giamatti really steals the show here. How great it is to see someone of Giamatti's chops FINALLY get the recognition he deserves and star in some great roles. Now he's proving that he's not just a co-star (THE TRUMAN SHOW, SAVING  PRIVATE RYAN). His Inspector Uhl character is miles away from ...well ...Miles in his career launching SIDEWAYS film. That the audience both roots for Uhl and hopes he fails is evidence of Giamatti's great acting ability.Rufus Sewell is the bad guy everyone loves to hate. He's done it time and again (A KNIGHT'S TALE, HELEN OF TROY, etc.) and pulls in a wonderfully slimy character portrayal here, too.But Jessica Biel is the biggest surprise. Looking both pretty and elegant, Biel goes further than she's ever gone before - far beyond 7th HEAVEN and THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE - and may have cemented herself as an actress with Oscar-caliber potential.The biggest letdown for film-o-philes will be that The Illusionist doesn't expand much beyond what they saw in the film's trailers a few months ago. But it does entertain, and it's visually interesting and well shot. Just don't expect too much from the script and you'll probably be just fine.",4,Trailers Tell All,1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,3658,"['Much', 'film', 'interest', 'moment', 'audiences', 'see', 'trailers', 'such', 'was', 'case', 'THE', 'ILLUSIONIST', 'dark', 'themes', 'nice', 'sets', 'pretty', 'supernatural', 'undertones', 'probably', 'drew', 'movie-goers', 'theaters', 'checking', 'out', 'trailers', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'find', 'little', 'else', 'Illusionist', 'disappointment', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fall', 'level', 'despair', 'hatred', 'film', 'movie', 'buffs', 'may', 'feel', 'were', 'lied', 'when', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'high-caliber', 'flick', 'were', 'expecting.The', 'story', 'Eisenheim', 'Illusionist', 'played', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'AMERICAN', 'HISTORY', 'X', 'Norton', 'okay', 'job', 'scripted', 'character', 'have', 'few', 'emotions', 'Eisenheim', 'life', 'focused', 'magical', 'craft', 'left', 'hometown', 'love', 'life', 'Sophie', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'ELIZABETHTOWN', 'fellow', 'teenager', 'who', 'way', 'Eisenheim', 'station', 'Fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'find', 'Eisenheim', 'Vienna', 'only', 'discover', 'Sophie', 'now', 'beautiful', 'young', 'baroness', 'slated', 'marry', 'upper', 'echelon', 'royalty', 'husband-to-be', 'dangerous', 'manipulating', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'DARK', 'CITY', 'when', 'Eisenheim', 'Sophie', 'try', 'rekindle', 'love', 'interest', 'deadly', 'forces', 'are', 'play', 'are', 'ready', 'rip', 'apart', 'again', 'One', 'forces', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'CINDERELLA', 'MAN', 'upstart', 'poor', 'butcher', 'who', 'trying', 'rise', 'power', 'own', 'Viennese', 'Mayor', 'Uhl', 'Nice', 'ring', 'eh', '.Eisenheim', 'Sophie', 'concoct', 'plan', 'can', 'detach', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'plan', 'doomed', 'start', 'Sophie', 'life', 'put', 'danger', 'Eisenheim', 'use', 'incredible', 'illusionist', 'powers', 'help', 'save', 'lives', 'love', 'can', 'work', 'title', 'main', 'character', 'much', 'what', 'seen', 'complete', 'illusion', 'one', 'carefully', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'hints', 'what', 'truly', 'going', 'Make', 'disappear', 'Sophie', 'Eisenheim', 'beginning', 'film', 'cower', 'hut', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'obviously', 'rest', 'life', 'rest', 'film.The', 'shinning', 'stars', 'Illusionist', 'are', 'Giamatti', 'Sewell', 'surprisingly', 'Biel', 'entire', 'focus', 'film', 'Norton', 'character', 'tough', 'get', 'when', 'what', 'mostly', 'sit', 'stage', 'make', 'soulful', 'apparitions', 'appear', 'looking', 'were', 'having', 'particularly', 'tough', 'bowel', 'movement.Paul', 'Giamatti', 'really', 'show', 'here', 'How', 'great', 'see', 'someone', 'Giamatti', 'chops', 'FINALLY', 'get', 'recognition', 'star', 'great', 'roles', 'Now', 'proving', 'not', 'just', 'co-star', 'THE', 'TRUMAN', 'SHOW', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'character', 'miles', 'away', 'well', 'Miles', 'career', 'launching', 'SIDEWAYS', 'film', 'audience', 'roots', 'Uhl', 'evidence', 'Giamatti', 'great', 'acting', 'ability.Rufus', 'Sewell', 'bad', 'guy', 'everyone', 'hate', 'done', 'time', 'again', 'A', 'KNIGHT', 'TALE', 'HELEN', 'OF', 'TROY', 'etc', 'wonderfully', 'slimy', 'character', 'portrayal', 'here', 'too.But', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'Looking', 'pretty', 'elegant', 'Biel', 'further', 'ever', 'gone', 'far', '7th', 'HEAVEN', 'THE', 'TEXAS', 'CHAINSAW', 'MASSACRE', 'may', 'have', 'cemented', 'actress', 'Oscar-caliber', 'potential.The', 'biggest', 'letdown', 'film-o-philes', 'will', 'be', 'Illusionist', ""n't"", 'expand', 'much', 'what', 'saw', 'film', 'trailers', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'entertain', 'visually', 'interesting', 'well', 'shot', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'script', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'just', 'fine']",N/A

He is supposed to be a tyrannical lunatic, but when confronted with the man who betrays him, he just walks around and doesn't do much else.

For the most part, he eschews the blockbuster material that his brat pack contemporaries gravitate toward (seriously, has the ""Ocean's"" series become the new Police Academy franchise?), and picks roles that aren't afraid to challenge and/or bore the audience.  I mean bore as a compliment, in the way that movies without explosions, gratuitous sex, or cartoon violence risk doing these days.  By these standards, The Illusionist is boring.  And great.Norton can act, too.  He brings a gravity to his role as Eisenheim the Illusionist that lends the perfect weight to the film: you believe he could exist in turn of the 20th Century Vienna (despite a wavering and unconvincing accent)(just try imagining Ben Affleck in this part), just as you believe he's tortured by the pain visited him throughout the film; yet he enchants you with each trick up his sleeve, and he's mischievous enough to keep your hopes for comeuppance against the film's villains alive.  Paul Giamatti, as always, is excellent, and Jessica Biel showed more maturity than I knew she had (to be fair, I knew her more for her looks than for any acting I'd previously seen (those work here, too, incidentally)).  Rufus Sewell captures the unctuous arrogance and privilege of the aristocracy very well as Crown Prince Leopold.The film is gorgeously shot, like the film equivalent of an old-time novelty photograph.  The illusions themselves are visually captivating, and don't at all seem anachronistic.  They grow darker as the film does, though not in such a way that you mind the symbolism.**PARTIAL SPOILER AHEAD**One complaint I had with the film curiously resolved itself for the better after some thought and another viewing.  Without giving away too much, The Illusionist's end reminded me of a early 1900's cross between The Usual Suspects and The Shawshank Redemption, but with less realism than either of those films.  I was angry at how neatly and summarily everything got wrapped up.  Then I listened to the commentary for the last scene and felt a little better, as I heard director Neil Burger remind me of illusion as the film's central theme, and describe the film's last few minutes as potentially real or a just figment of a character's imagination.

Edward Norton is astounding as Eisenheim, a self-taught illusionist who, as a child, fell in love with a girl who was of noble birth, while he was nothing but the son of a carpenter.

However, Eisenheim's chosen vocation of ""illusionist"" comes under fire from the crown prince of the empire (his true love's betrothed). Can they escape the crown Prince's grasp...or will tragedy strike the young couple?One of my favorite things about this film was it's ability to provide the audience with real life truths in a manner that provokes the critical thinking thought process. What is the meaning of life? Does it matter what our station in life is? Does love conquer all? Is the law always on the side of good?

This movie was shot beautifully. So many warm, almost sepia tones to this film. Plenty of greens, golds, browns, and reds. Every scene was shot with so much care in mind. The film was as much a piece of art as it was a movie, a theme recurrent in the movie. Eisenheim's magic was as much art as it was illusion.I'm shocked that this movie wasn't up for any awards at this year's Oscars. In my opinion, it was just as good as Pan's Labyrinth which was up for I believe 5 awards. I'll go ahead and give in an award for making it into my list of top films!Beautiful movie that I highly recommend to anyone.

1032234,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000K7VHPU,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 3]","When a dazzled audience watches a magician at work, the one question that goes through everyone's mind is, ""How did he do that?"" It's interesting such a question would be raised at all, considering most of us really don't want to know; we mentally examine the methodology behind the illusions, yet we understand that if the secrets are revealed, the greatness of the moment is lost. It's a good thing most professional magicians refuse to be so open; giving away an illusion's secret reduces entertainment to a mere technicality. The same can be said for movies, specifically movies about magic. The television ads for ""The Illusionist"" tell the viewers to not give away the film's secret. True to its word, it does have more than a couple of tricks up its sleeve. And much like a magic trick, each sequence builds on another until a rather elaborate twist ending is reached. At that point, the audience is completely wowed.I say this in spite of the fact that it's not the most original of twist endings. The story is also a bit formulaic, relying on well-established characterizations and assumable outcomes for advancement. However, I found that I could look past these shortcomings; it's quite an entertaining film, effectively mixing mystery with a solid romance. There are also some very good performances, no small feat considering all three leads had to fake believable European accents. It was especially surprising in terms of Edward Norton; his role called for a suave, sophisticated demeanor, pretty much to the point of seeming emotionless. I initially had my doubts that he could pull it off. But as with many of his other roles, he's proven himself capable of rising to the occasion.Based on Steven Millhauser's short story ""Eisenheim the Illusionist,"" the film's components are loosely like those of a fable. Fables are often basic, using shorter formats and simpler language as a way of conveying a moral to a wide audience. While ""The Illusionist"" has no moral, it does make use of tried and true storytelling methods to get its point across. We have the forbidden love between two classes of people and what they endure in an attempt to live happily ever after. We have the villain who will stop at nothing to keep the incurable lovebirds apart. We have the clever, handsome, enigmatic hero. We have the skeptical side characters. Most importantly, we have entertaining acts of illusion that deceive us just as much as they deceive the characters.The plot in and of itself is constructed less like a fable and more like a mystery novel. Set in early twentieth century Vienna, the story centers on the mysterious stage magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a man whose grace and charm can bewitch an audience the moment he steps on stage. He was first introduced to magic as a teenager (played by Aaron Johnson). Back then, he was nothing more than the peasant son of a cabinet maker. Then one day, he meets a wandering magician sitting under a tree. From then on, he's a completely different person, devoting all his free time to perfecting the art and craft of magic tricks. And what a time to learn; his skills attract the attention of Sophie von Teschen (played as a teenager by Eleanor Tomlinson), a wealthy young girl of high social stature. As you can probably imagine, the enevitable romance is strictly forbidden. Ultimately, the two are forcefully separated.Fifteen years later, Eisenheim is back in Austria after having travelled the world in the study of magic. He is rapidly becoming one of the country's most popular illusionists, thrilling audiences with his impeccable sense of timing and style. He can make an orange tree grow from an empty pot. He can make a reflection behave differently than the real person. He can even make coins appear out of a red handkerchief. Word of his astounding illusions quickly reaches Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), the arrogant, immature successor to the throne of Austria. He decides to attend one of the magician's shows. However, it's not because he wants be entertained; rather, he wants to expose Eisenheim as a fraud by purposely trying to poke holes in the act. It would seem that only he has such an agenda. Everyone else, he's astonished to discover, is actually willing to enjoy the show.At this point, the plot thickens dramatically. The Prince's intended is none other than Sophie von Teschen (now played by Jessica Biel), and when attending the performance with her fiancee, she finds herself assisting Eisenheim in one of his tricks. Right away, the two recognize each other from their childhoods, and old feelings resurface. The two begin an intesnse love affair, one the audience knows will end very badly if discovered. Unfortunately, Leopold rules everything with an iron fist, especially when it comes to marriage. Bodyguards and spies keep a close eye on Sophie on a regular basis, and her romance with Eisenheim is impossible to conceal.Determined to ruin the magician's reputation, Leopold hires Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to keep Eisenheim at bay. Uhl is of a shrewd and practical sort, always looking for the most logical explanation when conducting an investigation. He applies himself fully when it comes to deconstructing Eisenheim's tricks, which are impressive to say the least. At times, Uhl's rational mind is overshadowed by the need to believe; never mind logic and reason. Throughout the course of the film, it becomes one of his most challenging obstacles, and he's eventually forced to choose between loyalty to his country and the desire to expose the truth.Unfortunately, I can't describe any more of the plot. Keep in mind that this is a mystery, and far too many important details--ones that directly relate to the plot twist--are at stake. What I can say is that Eisenheim's simple sleight-of-hand illusions are eventually discarded for the ability to call forth dead spirits. This ability earns him a devoted following, one that puts a serious damper on Uhl's investigation and Leopold's vindictiveness. Like in all good mysteries, it eventually becomes a matter of putting the pieces together to form a clear picture.I realize that the previous paragraph was incredibly vague, but short of giving everything away, there's really no other way to say it. I'd rather you go and see the film for yourself. There's so much about it that works, especially the final scenes; they're appropriately sequenced, serving as a testament to the trickery magicians are known for. A lot of audiences don't like being fooled at the movies these days; they seem to think that fooling is only appropriate in live magic shows, where they actually look forward to asking, ""How did he do that?"" Not only does ""The Illusionist"" have all the best qualities of a live magic show, it also effectively reinterprets the classic Love Conquers All fable. I enjoyed this movie; it's clever, it's sneaky, and it delightfully toys with the audience's beliefs.",4,Sleight of Hand and Twist of Fate,1155945600,"08 19, 2006",2006,6951,"['When', 'dazzled',

1032235,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000K7VHPU,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[3, 4]","Everybody in everyday life uses magic. We all use our brain power to make things disappear and reappear. We use sleight of hand and misdirection. We use this magic to get ahead, stay ahead, cheat, make a move, enhance our PR, etc. The lesson we can learn from this excellent film is that to understand our magical powers is to be all powerful. ""The Illusionist"" tells the story of a magician (by trade) Eisenheim who becomes embroiled in a blood feud with Crown Price Leopold over a girl.  What ensues is a battle of illusions between the two. One has the cops do all his dirty work, makes Eisenheim's show go up in a puff of smoke, and makes his girlfriend disappear. The other is forced to counter those moves using more traditional magic.Edward Norton stars in his second quality film this year (after ""Down in the Valley"") and this time is playing a role better suited to his skills.  He nails the role of Eisenheim, even if he never disappears into it. The magic scenes are wonderful. Whether movie magic was used or not, I still found myself trying to figure out how he did that. It left me yearning to learn more about the history of magic, back before audiences were desensitized to magic by Hollywood. I also appreciated the way the film reminds us that the church and magic don't get along so well (remember the Harry Potter book burnings?). The reason, of course, being that magic delivers miracles whereas preachers are left discussing them. So the church has decided to disqualify magicians from the whole miracle making game (""Heretics!), talk about your sore losers. The first half of the film worked better than the second half. I enjoyed watching Eisenheim dance around his haters in Vienna, using simple magic and showmanship to drive them insane. Once the consequence of that insanity comes to bear, the story slows down in the extremist. The problem is that director Neil Burger thinks he has a real rabbit up his hat, but the ending is so very inevitable (it's called ""The Illusionist"" after all). It does all come together in a nice little bow, but they weren't fooling me. Paul Giamatti is stellar as always, but this isn't a sexy role like he had in ""Sideways"" and ""American Splendor."" Here he tones it down and remains hidden behind his beard.Eisenheim's success relies on the fact that he understands his power better than Leopold. To create a worthwhile illusion takes hard work and confidence. Leopold believed that his power was absolute, but no power is ever absolute (don't tell George Bush I said that). Illusions are just that and are far from real. It took an understanding in the human game of chess to make one person rise from the grave, another shape shift, and another fall to his knees, not magic. In other words, perception is reality. Burger thinks this movie is a magic trick, but I'm not buying it. I think he has a well made, well acted film that entertained me greatly. If he has been exposed as a phony magician, he still has me believing that he is a real film talent. ***1/2",3,Come see Eisenheim the Great,1156291200,"08 23, 2006",2006,3023,"['Everybody', 'everyday', 'life', 'magic', 'use', 'brain', 'power', 'make', 'things', 'disappear', 'reappear', 'use', 'sleight', 'hand', 'misdirection', 'use', 'magic', 'get', 'ahead', 'stay', 'ahead', 'cheat', 'make', 'move', 'enhance', 'PR', 'etc', 'lesson', 'can', 'learn', 'excellent', 'film', 'understand', 'magical', 'powers', 'be', 'powerful', 'Illusionist', 'story', 'magician', 'trade', 'Eisenheim', 'who', 'embroiled', 'blood', 'feud', 'Crown', 'Price', 'Leopold', 'girl', 'What', 'battle', 'illusions', 'two', 'One', 'cops', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'Eisenheim', 'show', 'go', 'up', 'puff', 'smoke', 'girlfriend', 'disappear', 'other', 'forced', 'counter', 'moves', 'using', 'more', 'traditional', 'magic.Edward', 'Norton', 'second', 'quality', 'film', 'year', 'Down', 'Valley', 'time', 'playing', 'role', 'better', 'suited', 'skills', 'role', 'Eisenheim', 'even', 'never', 'magic', 'scenes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Whether', 'movie', 'magic', 'was', 'used', 'not', 'still', 'found', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'did', 'left', 'yearning', 'learn', 'more', 'history', 'magic', 'back', 'audiences', 'were', 'desensitized', 'magic', 'Hollywood', 'also', 'appreciated', 'way', 'film', 'church', 'magic', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'so', 'well', 'remember', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'book', 'burnings', 'reason', 'course', 'being', 'magic', 'delivers', 'miracles', 'preachers', 'are', 'left', 'discussing', 'church', 'decided', 'disqualify', 'magicians', 'whole', 'miracle', 'making', 'game', 'Heretics', 'talk', 'sore', 'losers', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'worked', 'better', 'second', 'half', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Eisenheim', 'dance', 'haters', 'Vienna', 'using', 'simple', 'magic', 'showmanship', 'drive', 'insane', 'consequence', 'insanity', 'bear', 'story', 'down', 'extremist', 'problem', 'director', 'Neil', 'Burger', 'real', 'rabbit', 'up', 'hat', 'ending', 'so', 'very', 'inevitable', 'called', 'Illusionist', 'come', 'together', 'nice', 'little', 'bow', 'were', ""n't"", 'fooling', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'stellar', 'always', ""n't"", 'sexy', 'role', 'had', 'Sideways', 'American', 'Splendor', 'Here', 'down', 'hidden', 'beard.Eisenheim', 'success', 'relies', 'fact', 'power', 'better', 'Leopold', 'create', 'worthwhile', 'illusion', 'hard', 'work', 'confidence', 'Leopold', 'believed', 'power', 'was', 'absolute', 'power', 'ever', 'absolute', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'George', 'Bush', 'said', 'Illusions', 'are', 'just', 'are', 'far', 'real', 'took', 'understanding', 'human', 'game', 'chess', 'make', 'one', 'person', 'rise', 'grave', 'shape', 'shift', 'fall', 'knees', 'not', 'magic', 'other', 'words', 'perception', 'reality', 'Burger', 'movie', 'magic', 'trick', ""'m"", 'not', 'buying', 'think', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'acted', 'film', 'entertained', 'greatly', 'been', 'exposed', 'phony', 'magician', 'still', 'believing', 'real', 'film', 'talent', '***1/2']",N/A

1032242,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B000K7VHPU,C. Middleton,"[59, 65]","This is an excellent gothic thriller based on the short story by Steven Millhauser, Eisenheim The Illusionist, set in late 19th century Vienna about the son of a young cabinetmaker who falls in love with a young Viennese aristocrat and is banned from seeing her as he is a basic commoner. As the legend goes about the young lad, he meets a travelling magician on the road who shows him the secrets of illusion, where he sets off to exotic lands to learn the mysteries of life. He returns to Vienna after his travels and opens a show in the great city to astonish not only Vienna's common public with his quasi supernatural illusions, but also Crown Prince Rudolf, son of Emperor Franz Josef who then reigned over the Austrian Hungarian Empire.Originally the short story was written as a political criticism of the Monarchy, based on the scandalous incident, where the bodies of Rudolf and his mistress, Baroness Mary Vetsera were found shot in a Royal hunting lodge, apparently a murder suicide which the Royal family kept from the public for many years.Edward Norton as Eisenheim is understated and brilliant, as the many sleight of hand tricks in the film were actually done by the gifted actor. Norton must have practiced for months to reveal such confidence and skill needed for these types of trick. However, Norton's character portrayed a perfect man of mystery, begging the question, are these mere illusions or does Eisenheim possess supernatural power, controlling matter, energy, space and time itself.The special effects in this film are well done. My favourite illusion in the film, (and they're many) is the Excalibur Sword illusion where Eisenheim borrows Rudolf's sword, somehow magnetizes it to the stage standing straight up, asking the various aristocrats' in the audience to release it from its position. Of course none can release the sword, as they, like the Arthur legend, are not meant to be king. When Prince Rudolf attempts to pull the sword from its stationary stance, he finally does so with great effort; by causing the ruthless Prince some embarrassment, Eisenheim is now a targeted enemy of the Crown.Paul Giamatti as the corrupt Inspector Uhl really shows what a versatile and gifted actor he really is, able to do comedy, tragedy, fantasy...a very impressive performance.The overall look of the film had the atmosphere as if we are viewing a primary historical source, the director using 80 year old editing techniques etc., this was unusual but effective for such a mixed genre film - fantasy, thriller, supernatural thriller and fairy tale romance.When first seeing this film I was spellbound and the ending, a perfect twist, making The Illusionist a perfect example of skilful storytelling.This is an excellent film.",5,Film example of great storytelling,1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,2751,"['excellent', 'gothic', 'thriller', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Steven', 'Millhauser', 'Eisenheim', 'Illusionist', 'set', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'Vienna', 'son', 'young', 'cabinetmaker', 'who', 'love', 'young', 'Viennese', 'aristocrat', 'banned', 'seeing', 'basic', 'commoner', 'legend', 'young', 'lad', 'travelling', 'magician', 'road', 'who', 'secrets', 'illusion', 'where', 'exotic', 'lands', 'learn', 'mysteries', 'life', 'Vienna', 'travels', 'show', 'great', 'city', 'astonish', 'not', 'only', 'Vienna', 'common', 'public', 'quasi', 'supernatural', 'illusions', 'also', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Rudolf', 'son', 'Emperor', 'Franz', 'Josef', 'who', 'then', 'reigned', 'Austrian', 'Hungarian', 'Empire.Originally', 'short', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'political', 'criticism', 'Monarchy', 'based', 'scandalous', 'incident', 'where', 'bodies', 'Rudolf', 'mistress', 'Baroness', 'Mary', 'Vetsera', 'were', 'found', 'shot', 'Royal', 'hunting', 'lodge', 'apparently', 'murder', 'suicide', 'Royal', 'family', 'kept', 'public', 'many', 'years.Edward', 'Norton', 'Eisenheim', 'understated', 'brilliant', 'many', 'sleight', 'hand', 'tricks', 'film', 'were', 'actually', 'done', 'gifted', 'actor', 'Norton', 'must', 'have', 'practiced', 'months', 'reveal', 'such', 'confidence', 'skill', 'needed', 'types', 'trick', 'However', 'Norton', 'character', 'portrayed', 'perfect', 'man', 'mystery', 'begging', 'question', 'are', 'mere', 'illusions', 'Eisenheim', 'possess', 'supernatural', 'power', 'controlling', 'matter', 'energy', 'space', 'time', 'itself.The', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'favourite', 'illusion', 'film', ""'re"", 'many', 'Excalibur', 'Sword', 'illusion', 'where', 'Eisenheim', 'Rudolf', 'sword', 'somehow', 'stage', 'standing', 'straight', 'up', 'asking', 'various', 'aristocrats', 'audience', 'release', 'position', 'course', 'none', 'can', 'release', 'sword', 'Arthur', 'legend', 'are', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'king', 'When', 'Prince', 'Rudolf', 'attempts', 'pull', 'sword', 'stationary', 'stance', 'finally', 'so', 'great', 'effort', 'causing', 'ruthless', 'Prince', 'embarrassment', 'Eisenheim', 'now', 'targeted', 'enemy', 'Crown.Paul', 'Giamatti', 'corrupt', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'really', 'what', 'versatile', 'gifted', 'actor', 'really', 'able', 'do', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'fantasy', 'very', 'impressive', 'performance.The', 'overall', 'look', 'film', 'had', 'atmosphere', 'are', 'viewing', 'primary', 'historical', 'source', 'director', 'using', '80', 'year', 'old', 'editing', 'techniques', 'etc.', 'was', 'unusual', 'effective', 'mixed', 'genre', 'film', 'fantasy', 'thriller', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'fairy', 'tale', 'romance.When', 'first', 'seeing', 'film', 'was', 'spellbound', 'ending', 'perfect', 'twist', 'making', 'Illusionist', 'perfect', 'example', 'skilful', 'storytelling.This', 'excellent', 'film']",N/A

I watched and fell in love with The Prestige and was curious about a movie that was being compared to it called The Illusionist.  Curious, I gave it a whirl.  First thing I have to say is that the stories of The Illusionist and The Prestige are nothing alike.  Content-wise, they have similar themes and setting (late Victorian, early Edwardian) and then there is the fact that the protagonists of both these films are magicians.  There are also some supernatural or magic realism elements in both films as well.  However, the similarities end there.  This movie centers on Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a famous and fascinating illusionist who is rumored to have supernatural powers and uses them on his magic tricks.  He reunites with his childhood friend Sophie, a young duchess who had planned to run away with him when they were teenagers (Jessica Biel).  They meet again and sparks fly, but Sophie is engaged to the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), who is corrupt and sadistic and has the power to get rid of anyone who gets in his way.  Leopold, suspicious of their mutual affection, uses Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to find ways to get rid of Eisenheim.  Will Eisenheim and Sophie ever be free to be together?This is such a beautiful film.  The setting of Vienna during the turn of the twentieth century is truly breathtaking.  And the backdrop of magic and supernatural powers is just as eye catching.  This film is a feast for the eyes.  I absolutely love the twist at the end and it left me with a smile on my face.  This is a unique, suspenseful love story not like any other love story.  I have loved Edward Norton since watching him in Fight Club and he is absolutely wonderful here.  Biel and Sewell are also great in their roles.  Paul Giamatti, however, is a true showstopper here next to Norton.  He, like Michael Caine in The Prestige, plays a wonderfully complex character and you want him to be on the good guys' side.  The Illusionist has found a place in my DVD collection.  This is a must-see and a must-own for sure.  I love The Prestige for its dark theme, and I love The Illusionist for its magic and passion.

Slipman,"[2, 3]","Neil Burger does an outstanding job in writing and directing an engrossing, moody period piece taking place in turn of the 20th century Vienna.  The movie is filmed in the picturesque baroque settings of the Czech Republic.Edward Norton, a talented young actor who has compiled an impressive resume of excellent cinematic performances plays Eisenheim a highly skillful illusionist.  The lowly son of a cabinetmaker Norton was the childhood sweetheart of the aristocratic Duchess Sophie.  He was banished to quash this tabooed relationship.Fifteen years later he triumphantly returns to Vienna as a well respected magician.  His talents come to the attention of Chief Inspector Uhl played by the terrific Paul Giamatti in a role that might finally garner him a well deserved Oscar.  Uhl, himself an amateur magician is checking Norton out in anticipation of the attendance of Crown Prince Leopold to a performance.  The sinister and truculent crown prince played nicely by Rufus Sewell is ironically betrothed to Norton's old flame Sophie.When Norton and Sophie played by Jessica Biel reunite the sparks again begin to fly and they resume a relationship.  Giamatti, under the influence of the crown prince, has been following Sophie and reports back to him of their affair.Sewell in a murderous, jealous rage manhandles Biel and she is found the next day in the woods dead, a result of blood loss from a sword slash.  Leopold is implicated but Giamatti throws another man in jail for the crime, even though he has suspicions about the crown prince.Eisenheim is convinced that Leopold killed his beloved Sophie and changes his act and now begins to bring spirits back from the dead.  Everything seems cut and dry but is all as it seems?Overall the film is certainly one of the best to come along this season.

1032249,A1T3O2LILVK0C4,B000K7VHPU,"Count Orlok '22 "":(""","[0, 0]","It's odd, but in the year 2006 there were two major motion pictures to feature stories about magicians and/or illusionists. The first film was The Illusionist, while the second film wasThe Prestige. In my humble opinion The Prestige is a superior film mainly because of the film's technical execution under the watchful eye of director Christopher Nolan.But I digress.The Illusionist is a surprisingly engaging suspense film with strong supernatural or ""fantasy"" elements. Writer/director Neil Burger made the film on a relatively small budget, but this doesn't have a negative impact on the end result. On the contrary, The Illusionist is a better film than most supernatural thrillers because it relies on characterization to carry the story, rather than over-the-top action and unnecessary special effects. The few special effects in the film are subtle and understated, which in some strange way only makes them more impressive.The story is set in Vienna, during the dawn of the 20th century, where an illusionist named Eisenheim causes a commotion with his startling magic tricks. He soon attracts the intention of the social elite, including Vienna's own Crown Prince Leopold. Leopold, an arrogant, ambitious, and cynical man, feels threatened by Eisenheim's extraordinary abilities. He is outraged that Eisenheim knows more than he, and so as a ploy to reveal Eisenheim's methods, Leopold offers his fianc&eacute;e, the beautiful Duchess Sophie von Teschen to participate in one of Eisenheim's illusions. However, Crown Prince Leopold is ignorant to the fact that Eisenheim and the duchess were once childhood sweethearts and that Eisenheim made her a promise that they would one day be reunited. After Eisenheim's uncanny performance, he and the duchess rekindle their romance. When the jealous Crown Prince Leopold learns that the duchess has been unfaithful to him, he is consumed by jealousy and rage. When the duchess' body is found to have been murdered, the public suspects the crown prince has killed her, though they dare not voice their suspicions. But Leopold suspects Eisenheim's trickery played some part in his fianc&eacute;e's death, so he assigns Chief Inspector Uhl to uncover Eisenheim's secrets. Yet, Uhl is confounded when Eisenheim begins summoning disembodied spirits during his performances, and when Eisenheim conjures Duchess von Teschen's spirit on stage, the audience cries out that Crown Prince Leopold has murdered her. Fearing that a revolution against the monarchy may be at hand, Uhl doubles his efforts to unravel the growing mystery surrounding Eisenheim's abilities, the duchess' death, and what part if any that the crown prince had to play in her murder. But Uhl's investigation takes him deep into a world of illusion and conspiracy, where nothing is what it seems.One of the film's greatest strengths is the extraordinary ensemble cast, which featuresEdward Nortonas Eisenheim the Illusionist,Paul Giamattias Chief Inspector Uhl,Rufus Sewellas Crown Prince Leopold, and Jessica Biel as Duchess Sophie von Teschen. While Norton, Giamatti, and Sewell give typically strong performances, the real surprise is Jessica Biel, who gives what may be her most complex and convincing performance yet.Where the film fails ever so slightly is that director Neil Burger seems to be attempting to make some sort of a statement about the role that spirituality plays in politics. But this shortcoming is outweighed by the film's many superlatives. Employing numerous sleight of hand tricks to manipulate the audience's perception of the storyline, Neil Burger creates an ambiguity, which will leave viewers questioning whether anything truly supernatural occurred or whether the seeming magic that took place was just an elaborate deception.

1032251,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000K7VHPU,Craig Matteson,"[1, 1]","This is very romantic movie and is an interesting variant on the old theme of the talented and ambitious commoner and a beautiful princess falling in love, but she is promised to a prince she does not love.  The forces of the Universe keep them apart.  How can their love be fulfilled?  In this case, the ambitious commoner is an illusionist, a magician.The story is told through the eyes of Chief Inspector Uhl (played wonderfully by the always wonderful Paul Giamatti).  The narration comes as he provides a report to Prince Leopold (played with just the right sinister touch by Rufus Sewell) about what is known of the life of Eisenheim the Illusionist (mysteriously and romantically played by Edward Norton).  Although, the narration isn't quite comprehensive because we get to see things that the Inspector does not know.  However, we don't quite notice all this until after the film is over.  The movie keeps us in the moment quite effectively and we pretty much accept what we see as we go along.  This is just like the way we watch magic tricks.  We are looking for the way it is done, but the magician knows we are looking and uses that as part of his ability to divert our attention.It is important that I do not reveal any more about the story because learning the story as we watch it is the whole fun of a Romance such as this.  I will say that I loved the mood of the thing.  The actors are all fine. Jessica Biel as Sophie is the perfect love for Eisenheim.  She is able to be not only desirable, but has a common touch despite her regal carriage.  We can believe she is royal and that she would recognize and desire the noble love of a common cabinetmaker's son over the plans and political machinations a marriage to a prince would offer.Also, the quality of Aaron Johnson's portrayal of Eisenheim and Eleanor Tomlinson as the young Sophie need to be recognized. They have to convince us of the love and connect us to the adult characters.  They do so well that we know these are the same two people as adults without any faltering in belief.The music of Philip Glass is perfect for this film.  It adds just the right emotional connections and helps to tell a story that uses images as much as it uses words.A pretty darn good film.",5,A very effective turn on the commoner and the princess,1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,2249,"['very', 'romantic', 'movie', 'interesting', 'variant', 'old', 'theme', 'talented', 'ambitious', 'commoner', 'beautiful', 'princess', 'falling', 'love', 'promised', 'prince', 'not', 'love', 'forces', 'Universe', 'keep', 'apart', 'How', 'can', 'love', 'be', 'fulfilled', 'case', 'ambitious', 'commoner', 'illusionist', 'magician.The', 'story', 'told', 'eyes', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'always', 'wonderful', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'narration', 'report', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'played', 'just', 'right', 'sinister', 'touch', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'what', 'known', 'life', 'Eisenheim', 'Illusionist', 'mysteriously', 'romantically', 'played', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'narration', ""n't"", 'quite', 'comprehensive', 'get', 'see', 'things', 'Inspector', 'not', 'know', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'notice', 'film', 'movie', 'moment', 'quite', 'effectively', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'see', 'go', 'along', 'just', 'way', 'watch', 'magic', 'tricks', 'are', 'looking', 'way', 'done', 'magician', 'are', 'looking', 'part', 'ability', 'divert', 'attention.It', 'important', 'do', 'not', 'reveal', 'more', 'story', 'learning', 'story', 'watch', 'whole', 'fun', 'Romance', 'such', 'will', 'say', 'loved', 'mood', 'thing', 'actors', 'are', 'fine', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Sophie', 'perfect', 'love', 'Eisenheim', 'able', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'desirable', 'common', 'touch', 'regal', 'carriage', 'can', 'believe', 'royal', 'would', 'recognize', 'desire', 'noble', 'love', 'common', 'cabinetmaker', 'son', 'plans', 'political', 'machinations', 'marriage', 'prince', 'would', 'offer.Also', 'quality', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'portrayal', 'Eisenheim', 'Eleanor', 'Tomlinson', 'young', 'Sophie', 'need', 'be', 'recognized', 'have', 'convince', 'love', 'connect', 'adult', 'characters', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'know', 'are', 'same', 'two', 'people', 'adults', 'faltering', 'belief.The', 'music', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'perfect', 'film', 'just', 'right', 'emotional', 'connections', 'tell', 'story', 'images', 'as', 'much', 'words.A', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'film']",N/A

However, the latter was backed and promoted by a major Hollywood studio while the former was a modestly budgeted independent film. As a result, The Illusionist probably didn't receive the kind of exposure it deserved. Both films also differed radically in tone. While, The Prestige focused on the rising competition between two magicians and the dangerous lengths they went to top one another, The Illusionist was a deeply romantic film about lovers separated by class.Edward Norton is well cast as the intensely charismatic magician. It's a wonderfully modulated performance that suggests a hint of arrogance (like when he makes Leopold look momentarily foolish during a performance) with a vulnerability that lies underneath and that Sophie's presence brings out.Paul Giamatti is also excellent as Uhl, the audience surrogate. He narrates the film and is also a conflicted character, torn between his loyalty to Leopold and his sympathy with Eisenheim. The battle of wits between him and Eisenheim are well-played. Both are intelligent men who are very careful and meticulous in how they deal with their professions.The stunning Jessica Biel looks luminous in each and every shot. She's mainly known for appearing in forgettable Hollywood fluff like Summer Catch and Stealth but recently she's been trying to branch out and pick more substantial projects like Elizabethtown and Home of the Brave.The story of The Illusionist is deceptively simple: a love story on the surface but this is actually a bit of misdirection on director Neil Burger's part as we must pay attention to every detail.  Nothing is what it seems as he orchestrates the entire film like one of Eisenheim's illusions.There is an audio commentary by writer/director Neil Burger. He talks about what drew him to the short story and why he wanted to make it into a movie. He also speaks intelligently about the film's themes and character motivations.

1032257,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,B000K7VHPU,Dai-keag-ity,"[1, 3]","In 1880's Vienna a stage magician called Eisenheim becomes celebrated for his mystifying illusions. With but a single seed he can instantly grow a mature tree; he possesses a magical looking glass which shows death within it; and most jarringly of all he seems to bring ghosts back to walk among---and accuse---the living. His demonstrations of talent catch the notice of the bullying heir to the Habsburg throne, who becomes obsessed with finding out how the deeds are done. He employs his all-purpose right-hand man to investigate Eisenheim and learn what he can. Meanwhile, this master illusionist recognizes the Prince's fianc&eacute;e as a girl he had once known in his boyhood, when he was then the son of a rural woodworker. Soon the master magician and the Prince's intended renew a love they'd felt in their youths, and a dangerous affair begins.The Illusionist has a satisfyingly dark feel to it. It is like watching a European art film, only done with an A-list Hollywood cast. The cobblestones and solid last-century scenery in Prague are perfect for this sort of tale, the lighting effects heighten the tension and the awesome-yet-understated on-stage demonstrations of magic Eisenheim performs are well-chosen to convey the atmosphere of the production. Also Paul Giamatti is so great in the part of the corrupt Crown Prince's not-yet-corrupted investigator that he readily becomes the film's star. Edward Norton, a generally superb actor, seems concealed in his role as the illusionist of the movie's title. By saying ""concealed"" it isn't that the role overwhelms him, it is more that he allows the role to be of greater essence than he as the contemporary actor, and I admire that. Also I'll note that Jessica Biel gives the most solid performance of her career as the love interest of both the stoical Eisenheim and the immoral Crown Prince Leopold.The Illusionist was a movie I enjoyed seeing unfold before me, even as I somehow lost interest in the plot, and was even annoyed by certain aspects of it. Despite the fact I liked this film and have nothing but praise for its visuals, there were some huge holes in it and there was a requirement that disbelief be suspended almost past the point of ready indulgence. I found it entirely ridiculous that a noblewoman engaged to marry the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire (among whose members politically-advantageous marriages were arranged in infancy, not adulthood) would firstly have the sort of freedom to go about unguarded that we were expected to accept that Biel's character Sophie von Teschen did, and secondly, we were further asked to believe that the death of a woman of her status would be nonchalantly verified by other than Imperial physicians, and that her state funeral would provide access for her body to be so deftly stolen. Was there no embalming, no lying in state, no grand service? Surely there would have been, and just as surely that would have made events as described impossible. Also in historical reality, though Crown Prince Leopold's death was attributed to suicide with a pistol, it was carried out with a woman, his lover, as part of a ""romantic"" death pact, and the Prince was not the ambitious would-be usurping reactionary The Illusionist portrayed him to be, so in the name of storytelling history is left behind without a flicker of remorse.The bottom line is that this is a fine film to see but it isn't air-tight and it doesn't stand up to much scrutiny. It's good for its scenery and some of its performances, and especially for its stage magic, but events could never have come to pass as the twist ending tells us they did.",4,Spoilers Aplenty...,1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,3635,"['1880', 'Vienna', 'stage', 'magician', 'called', 'Eisenheim', 'becomes', 'celebrated', 'mystifying', 'illusions', 'single', 'seed', 'can', 'instantly', 'grow', 'mature', 'tree', 'magical', 'looking', 'glass', 'death', 'most', 'jarringly', 'bring', 'ghosts', 'back', 'walk', '-and', 'accuse', '-the', 'living', 'demonstrations', 'talent', 'catch', 'notice', 'bullying', 'heir', 'Habsburg', 'throne', 'who', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'out', 'how', 'deeds', 'are', 'done', 'all-purpose', 'right-hand', 'man', 'investigate', 'Eisenheim', 'learn', 'what', 'can', 'Meanwhile', 'master', 'illusionist', 'Prince', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'girl', 'had', 'once', 'known', 'boyhood', 'when', 'was', 'then', 'son', 'rural', 'woodworker', 'master', 'magician', 'Prince', 'intended', 'renew', 'love', ""'d"", 'felt', 'youths', 'dangerous', 'affair', 'begins.The', 'Illusionist', 'satisfyingly', 'dark', 'feel', 'watching', 'European', 'art', 'film', 'only', 'done', 'A-list', 'Hollywood', 'cast', 'cobblestones', 'solid', 'last-century', 'scenery', 'Prague', 'are', 'perfect', 'sort', 'tale', 'lighting', 'effects', 'heighten', 'tension', 'awesome-yet-understated', 'on-stage', 'demonstrations', 'magic', 'Eisenheim', 'performs', 'are', 'well-chosen', 'convey', 'atmosphere', 'production', 'Also', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'so', 'great', 'part', 'corrupt', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'not-yet-corrupted', 'investigator', 'readily', 'film', 'star', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'generally', 'superb', 'actor', 'concealed', 'role', 'illusionist', 'movie', 'title', 'saying', 'concealed', ""n't"", 'role', 'overwhelms', 'more', 'role', 'be', 'greater', 'essence', 'contemporary', 'actor', 'admire', 'Also', ""'ll"", 'note', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'most', 'solid', 'performance', 'career', 'love', 'interest', 'stoical', 'Eisenheim', 'immoral', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold.The', 'Illusionist', 'was', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'unfold', 'even', 'somehow', 'lost', 'interest', 'plot', 'was', 'even', 'annoyed', 'certain', 'aspects', 'fact', 'liked', 'film', 'have', 'nothing', 'praise', 'visuals', 'were', 'huge', 'holes', 'was', 'requirement', 'disbelief', 'be', 'suspended', 'almost', 'point', 'ready', 'indulgence', 'found', 'entirely', 'noblewoman', 'engaged', 'marry', 'heir', 'Austro-Hungarian', 'Empire', 'members', 'politically-advantageous', 'marriages', 'were', 'arranged', 'infancy', 'not', 'adulthood', 'would', 'firstly', 'have', 'sort', 'freedom', 'go', 'about', 'unguarded', 'were', 'expected', 'accept', 'Biel', 'character', 'Sophie', 'von', 'Teschen', 'did', 'secondly', 'were', 'further', 'asked', 'believe', 'death', 'woman', 'status', 'would', 'be', 'nonchalantly', 'verified', 'other', 'Imperial', 'physicians', 'state', 'funeral', 'would', 'provide', 'access', 'body', 'be', 'so', 'deftly', 'stolen', 'Was', 'embalming', 'lying', 'state', 'grand', 'service', 'Surely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'surely', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'events', 'described', 'impossible', 'Also', 'historical', 'reality', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'death', 'was', 'attributed', 'suicide', 'pistol', 'was', 'carried', 'out', 'woman', 'lover', 'part', 'romantic', 'death', 'pact', 'Prince', 'was', 'not', 'ambitious', 'would-be', 'usurping', 'Illusionist', 'portrayed', 'be', 'so', 'name', 'storytelling', 'history', 'left', 'flicker', 'remorse.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'fine', 'film', 'see', ""n't"", 'air-tight', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'much', 'scrutiny', 'good', 'scenery', 'performances', 'especially', 'stage', 'magic', 'events', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'come', 'pass', 'twist', 'ending', 'tells', 'did']",N/A

The Illusionist is about a 19th-century practitioner of the art of illusion, whose name is Eisenheim, played by Edward Norton (the guy behind the mask in Kingdom of Heaven.)His love interest in this atmospheric romantic drama is played by Jessica Biel (7th Heaven), and she is quite good in a role here.This is also the first role that I had actually liked Paul Giamatti in.Rufus Sewell once again plays royalty gone bad quite capably.So in conclusion, if you like atmospheric romantic drama, or magic and illusion, or perhaps something to remind you of the life of  A Conan Doyle, see this movie.  I don't think you will be disappointed.I feel The Illusionist DVD is one of the best releases of 2006.  If you like period movies, and you like magic, then you will like the illusionist.If you like movies about the 19th century, you also like The Illusionist.  With Prague Czechoslovakia doubling for Vienna.The best thing about this movie is that was produced independently on a relatively limited budget in 45 days.  The commentary on the DVD explains how the magic tricks were done.  Although, it doesn't take you through them step-by-step.The cast is fine Edward Norton, and Jessica Biel do a fine job with the roles.  Paul Giamatti is also great.  The DVD commentary reveals that Jessica Biel had to campaign for even an audition to get the role of Sophie, because the producers felt that she looked too modern.This film will be compared to The Prestige because they are both movies about magic, and meet and magicians.  However I feel that The Illusionist, is a much better movie, because it had a much smaller budget to work with, and more constraints on its time.So I say, get The Illusionist DVD, and The Prestige DVD when it becomes available, and judge for yourself.

1032260,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000K7VHPU,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[3, 7]","Thanks in large part to very fine performances by the three leads, `The Illusionist' stands apart from most films released in the early part of the year as a true cinematic treat.  I had wanted to see this film upon it's release but was unable due to the fact that it was released in very few theaters and only for a short time (at least in my area) but I was able to find it in stock at my local video store last night and was immediately spellbound by the direction this movie took.  I'm tempted to say that this was even more intoxicating than `The Prestige', but I'm yet to make up my mind.Telling the story of undying love set in Vienna as renowned illusionist Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is reunited with his long lost love Duchess Sophie (Jessica Biel), `The Illusionist' does a brilliant job of building character and delivering enough twists and turns to keep you intrigued.  Eisenheim grew up the son of a carpenter, poor and banned from seeing his love Sophie.  He leaves town and swears to come back for her, but they are not reunited until 15-years later when she is promised to marry the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) a man known not only for his ideas of ruining a nation and overthrowing his fathers rule but also for his hot temper towards the women in his life.After their chance meeting both Eisenheim and Sophie devise a plan to be together but their plan is quickly being ruined by Leopold and his Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) who is hot on their tail every step of the way.  When Sophie turns up dead it seems as if their plan has been stopped, but now a more pressing task is at hand, trying to find her killer.  In a game of wits Eisenheim and Uhl expertly combat one another and bring so much life to this film it's almost impossible not to become entranced.Edward Norton has always been one of my favorite actors, and here is no exception as he embraces his role and commands his performance, but he's upstaged every time by Paul Giamatti who just dominates every scene.  Just watch them interact at the restaurant, sitting across from one another and conversing, it's flawless, intimidating and utterly captivating.  Take a close look at two masters of their profession delivering the goods.  Jessica Biel must also be singled out for the maturity she brings to her character.  She has truly grown up since `7th Heaven' and deserves all the praise and even accolades she's received because of this, and Rufus Sewell is equally impressive as the oppressive and unlikable Leopold.Beautifully shot, like an old painting, and splendidly brought to life by a talented cast (just listen to the accents, not one of them seems forced or out of place...a true testament to their strength as actors), `The Illusionist' is more than likely one of the finest films of the past year and deserves our utmost attention.  I feel strongly that had this film been released in November or early December it would have made a strong showing in the Oscar race for from the script to the acting to the directing to the strength of the picture itself it truly is a fantastic experience.

There is not a single dull moment in this wonderful film, but it does not have that throw-it-all-at-you-at-once mood that so many other movies do.  Well written dialogue and an intense yet sometimes eerily calm plot line keeps things interesting throughout the whole film.

It took me some rewinding a re-watching of some scenes to grasp what was going on, but contrary to the norm, this is not even a minor annoyance with this film.

Eisenheim the Illusionist (Edward Norton), the son of a carpenter who trained himself in the art of magic, has created a stir in Vienna when he arrives, seemingly out of nowhere, to charm the city with his spectacular illusions.  When the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) volunteers his soon-to-be fiancee as a subject in one of Eisenheim's most terrifying tricks, all starts going very wrong between the two men -- one a mere magician and carpenter's son and the other the most powerful man in the city.Ed Norton exudes mystery and charm as Eisenhem, but his is not the only memorable performance. Jessica Biel as Sophie, the woman of his dreams, is both sensuous and conflicted.  The chemistry between Norton and Biel is palpable, even if it may be too muted for some viewers.  Paul Giamatti's Inspector is likewise complex, both in his loyalty to the Crown Prince and in his personal fascination with Eisenheim.  The best part of this story is not the traditional themes of class division and love but rather the atmosphere of the period combined with dark illusions that suggest a Faustian deal with the devil and death.A first-rate film, The Illusionist is marred only by the occasional predictable plot elements.

Beautiful, enchanting cinematography; a dynamic, gifted cast; exceptional music; a compelling story--all of these components mesh and blend to create a spellbinding (pardon the pun) viewing experience.Edward Norton has never been better; he captures the mystery, the power, the allure, of Eisenheim the Illusionist.  Yet Norton appears in roughly half the film; Paul Giamatti carries the other half as Inspector Uhl, a man torn between his loyalty to his superiors--and his desire to know the truth.  I thought Giamatti was at the pinnacle of his talents in ""Cinderalla Man,"" but I was wrong.  The actor is in rarefied air in this role.  Rufus Sewell is deliciously evil as Crown Prince Leopold, and Jessica Biel is a more than worthy love interest for both the Prince and Eisenheim.I won't belabor the plot, as it's been regurgitated ad infinitum in previous reviews, but I am running out of superlatives.

This movie seems designed for a smaller art house audience.The movie opens with a prologue in which a common young cabinet-maker becomes interested in magic and draws the attention and affection of a young noblewoman.  Their romance is a forbidden one, and the young man leaves home to find his fortune.""The Illusionist"" properly gets underway as the acclaimed magician Eisenheim returns to 19th Century Vienna after a long absence.  Played with stoic and enigmatic understatement by Edward Norton, Eisenheim peforms some remarkable feats on stage, so good that the viewer is never quite sure, until the end of the movie, whether he is the simple illusionist he claims to be, or something more.One night, a volunteer from the audience turns out to be the noblewoman Sophie (played by Jessica Biel), fiancee of Leopold the Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary, but once Eisenheim's childhood sweetheart.  The two contrive to meet in private, to the anger of Leopold, played by Rufus Sewell as an ambitious but abusive and drunken lout.  Leopold sends Police Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to warn off Eisenheim.Eisenheim and Sophie are soon committed to a desperate plan to be together, only to be foiled by Sophie's apparent murder by Leopold.  An angry Eisenheim begins a subtle campaign to challenge and undermine Leopold through his magic shows, initiating a contest of wills with Uhl, who is torn between his duty to investigate Sophie's murder and his ambition to rise with the Crown Prince.  As the movie spins out to its violent conclusion, the only thing the viewer can count on is that nothing is quite as it seems.""The Illusionist"" nicely captures the atmospherics of Vienna in its last decades as capital of the Austria-Hungarian Empire.  The movie has a measured pace, meditating over its detailed period sets and relying on some superb acting, especially by Giamatti, to carry along a rather austere plot.  The ending is nicely done, if a little too convenient for the dark tone of most of the movie.

Such an introduction wrenches the audience in and leaves viewers thirsting for more. In this spirit, the movie begins with the arrest of Eisenheim the illusionist. He's summoning something misty and ghostly on the stage when the Police Commissioner suddenly halts the production. Then flash back to Eisenhiem's youth. He impresses an aristocratic girl named Sofie - by, of all things, balancing an egg on a stick - and the classic forbidden love story unfolds. Sofie becomes enraptured by Eisensteins' illusions, but the inevitable separation occurs. The upper class won't hear of their kind mixing with a peasant. But before parting, Eisenstein constructs a special locket for Sophie that morphs into a heart. What girl wouldn't be impressed by that?Fifteen years pass. Eisenstein makes a name for himself as an illusionist. He turns gloves into soaring birds. He makes an orange tree sprout from dirt in front of people's eyes. But one night in Vienna, when the Crown Prince volunteers his bride and princess to be to the stage, Eisenstein instantly recognizes his lost love. And of course she's engaged to the future emperor of Austria. Dang the luck!Sofie and Eisenstein resume their more than friendly tryst, but the Crown Prince gets word of it. He tries to drag Sofie off to Budapest to overthrow his father the Emporer, but Sofie flees. In the process, the movie pulls an Alfred Hitchcock and kills off the female lead. All appearances point to the Crown Prince, but no charges get posted.Stricken with grief, Eisenstien buys a theater and begins summoning the dead. Crowds flock to his shows. One night the Crown Prince appears in disguise and sees Sofie appear on the stage as an apparition. She makes a vague, almost Charlie Chan-esque statement, that the murderer is in the room, then disappears without divulging the name. The people in the crowd have made up their mind, of course.Obviously the Crown Prince can't take this, so he orders the arrest of Eisenstien. But of course the illusionist has a trick up his sleeve, and his final performance leaves everyone mesmerized.The resolution of the film, and the unwrapping of the final illusion, gets revealed very rapidly, like cake swallowed too fast. Viewers that blink may literally miss important plot elements. This pivotal scene unfolds in the fashion of a ""my life flashed before my eyes"" scene.One real nagging question remains. The Crown Prince is actually innocent. Though arguably a corrupt man, doesn't he get a little more than he deserves? After all, he didn't really do anything in the space of the movie apart from acting like a louse and being unpleasant. Some rumors waft about the mysterious deaths of his previous lovers, but they remain only speculation.Also, whether or not Eisenstien really summoned the dead remains unresolved. The film highly suggests that he did not. Or did he? In at least one case he clearly did not. Remember not to blink.""The Illusionist"" contains beautiful imagery of early twentieth century Vienna. Visually it stuns. Overall, apart from a few vexing questions, it remains a highly entertaining, if somewhat slow-paced, film. But in the end it takes an illusionist to expose the illusions of the powerful and to suggest that eternal love, manifest in the locket, is no illusion.",4,Illusions and non-illusions revealed...,1156550400,"08 26, 2006",2006,3488,"['Illusionist', 'become', 'very', 'common', 'narrative', 'technique', 'movies', 'begin', 'moment', 'just', 'climax', 'then', 'way', 'back', 'build', 'story', 'back', 'up', 'exact', 'moment', 'introduction', 'audience', 'viewers', 'thirsting', 'more', 'spirit', 'movie', 'arrest', 'Eisenheim', 'illusionist', 'summoning', 'something', 'misty', 'ghostly', 'stage', 'when', 'Police', 'Commissioner', 'suddenly', 'production', 'Then', 'back', 'Eisenhiem', 'youth', 'aristocratic', 'girl', 'named', 'Sofie', 'things', 'balancing', 'egg', 'stick', 'classic', 'forbidden', 'love', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Sofie', 'becomes', 'enraptured', 'Eisensteins', 'illusions', 'inevitable', 'separation', 'upper', 'class', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'kind', 'mixing', 'peasant', 'parting', 'Eisenstein', 'special', 'locket', 'Sophie', 'heart', 'What', 'girl', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'impressed', 'Fifteen', 'years', 'pass', 'Eisenstein', 'name', 'illusionist', 'gloves', 'soaring', 'birds', 'orange', 'tree', 'sprout', 'dirt', 'front', 'people', 'eyes', 'one', 'night', 'Vienna', 'when', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'volunteers', 'bride', 'princess', 'be', 'stage', 'Eisenstein', 'instantly', 'lost', 'love', 'course', 'engaged', 'future', 'emperor', 'Austria', 'Dang', 'luck', 'Sofie', 'Eisenstein', 'resume', 'more', 'friendly', 'tryst', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'word', 'drag', 'Sofie', 'Budapest', 'overthrow', 'father', 'Emporer', 'Sofie', 'flees', 'process', 'movie', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'kills', 'female', 'lead', 'appearances', 'point', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'charges', 'get', 'posted.Stricken', 'grief', 'Eisenstien', 'theater', 'summoning', 'dead', 'Crowds', 'flock', 'shows', 'One', 'night', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'disguise', 'sees', 'Sofie', 'appear', 'stage', 'apparition', 'vague', 'almost', 'Charlie', 'Chan-esque', 'statement', 'murderer', 'room', 'then', 'divulging', 'name', 'people', 'crowd', 'have', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'course.Obviously', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'orders', 'arrest', 'Eisenstien', 'course', 'illusionist', 'trick', 'up', 'sleeve', 'final', 'performance', 'everyone', 'mesmerized.The', 'resolution', 'film', 'unwrapping', 'final', 'illusion', 'revealed', 'very', 'rapidly', 'cake', 'swallowed', 'too', 'fast', 'Viewers', 'blink', 'may', 'literally', 'miss', 'important', 'plot', 'elements', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'unfolds', 'fashion', 'life', 'flashed', 'eyes', 'scene.One', 'real', 'nagging', 'question', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'actually', 'innocent', 'arguably', 'corrupt', 'man', ""n't"", 'get', 'little', 'more', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'space', 'movie', 'apart', 'acting', 'louse', 'being', 'unpleasant', 'rumors', 'waft', 'mysterious', 'deaths', 'previous', 'lovers', 'remain', 'only', 'speculation.Also', 'not', 'Eisenstien', 'really', 'summoned', 'dead', 'unresolved', 'film', 'highly', 'did', 'not', 'did', 'least', 'one', 'case', 'clearly', 'did', 'not', 'Remember', 'not', 'blink', 'Illusionist', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'early', 'twentieth', 'century', 'Vienna', 'Visually', 'Overall', 'apart', 'few', 'vexing', 'questions', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'somewhat', 'slow-paced', 'film', 'end', 'illusionist', 'expose', 'illusions', 'powerful', 'suggest', 'eternal', 'love', 'manifest', 'locket', 'illusion']",N/A

Director Neil Burger makes The Illusionist more than just a story though, taking on an artistic quality that transcends typical filmmaking. Brilliant atmosphere, authentic characters, a great script, beautiful scenery, and a wonderful music score make this one a gem.One of the film's interesting aspects is just the allegorical quality that emerges. It's much more than a thriller, mystery, or period film about love and magic. Eisenheim's crushed hopes of love in childhood are given a second chance, and this plays into the theme of rekindling lost love, giving the film a parable-like quality.  Illusion-- the subject of what is real and what is not--is a central idea in not only the story's premise, but the film's d&eacute;nouement at the finish. For this reason, you can't take everything at ""face value"" - supernatural and mystery play a major role in the building of Eisenheim as a character.The characterization and script are superb, and this really keeps the plot's flow at a steady pace. Edward Norton brings the character of Eisenheim to life, giving a mysterious yet charismatic aspect to the role. He makes this idea of creating illusion an art form on the big screen, as he dazzles many in the audience with his shows. It is later on in life when, while doing a show, he meets up with childhood friend and sweetheart Sophie, who is now engaged to the Crown Prince, a villainous man who reportedly abuses his lovers. This meeting sets into motion the conflict between Eisenheim and the Crown Prince, archrivals for Sophie's love. Another important role is that of the Inspector, who is both suspicious and in awe of Eisenheim's illusionary feats, but must ultimately answer to the Crown Prince. While the Crown Prince wants Eisenheim shut down for blasphemy and heresy, the Inspector has no real proof to charge him with.Mythical elements, a great music score, and clever imagination make this feel like we are transported to Vienna circa 1900 to watch the story unfold. There is magic and illusion, and the suspense builds after Eisenheim's shows take on a much darker feel, in which he can reach into the ""other world"" to find out information about lost loved ones.Over all, there is a great job of filmmaking and storytelling here. There is definitely an art-like quality to The Illusionist, and there is more than meets the eye!",5,Exceptional Filmmaking,1229126400,"12 13, 2008",2008,2542,"['One', 'could', 'call', 'period', 'film', 'perhaps', 'gothic', 'romance', 'old-fashioned', 'would', 'be', 'compliments', 'Illusionist', 'idea', 'great', 'film', 'storytelling', 'meaning', 'Director', 'Neil', 'Burger', 'Illusionist', 'more', 'just', 'story', 'taking', 'artistic', 'quality', 'typical', 'filmmaking', 'Brilliant', 'atmosphere', 'authentic', 'characters', 'great', 'script', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'wonderful', 'music', 'score', 'make', 'one', 'gem.One', 'film', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'just', 'allegorical', 'quality', 'much', 'more', 'thriller', 'mystery', 'period', 'film', 'love', 'magic', 'Eisenheim', 'crushed', 'hopes', 'love', 'childhood', 'are', 'given', 'second', 'chance', 'theme', 'rekindling', 'lost', 'love', 'giving', 'film', 'parable-like', 'quality', 'Illusion', 'subject', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'not', 'central', 'idea', 'not', 'only', 'story', 'premise', 'film', 'd', 'eacute', 'finish', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'everything', 'face', 'value', 'supernatural', 'mystery', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'building', 'Eisenheim', 'character.The', 'characterization', 'script', 'are', 'superb', 'really', 'plot', 'flow', 'steady', 'pace', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'character', 'Eisenheim', 'life', 'giving', 'mysterious', 'yet', 'charismatic', 'aspect', 'role', 'idea', 'creating', 'illusion', 'art', 'form', 'big', 'screen', 'many', 'audience', 'shows', 'later', 'life', 'when', 'doing', 'show', 'up', 'childhood', 'friend', 'sweetheart', 'Sophie', 'who', 'now', 'engaged', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'villainous', 'man', 'who', 'reportedly', 'lovers', 'meeting', 'motion', 'conflict', 'Eisenheim', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'archrivals', 'Sophie', 'love', 'important', 'role', 'Inspector', 'who', 'suspicious', 'awe', 'Eisenheim', 'illusionary', 'feats', 'must', 'ultimately', 'answer', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Eisenheim', 'shut', 'down', 'blasphemy', 'heresy', 'Inspector', 'real', 'proof', 'charge', 'with.Mythical', 'elements', 'great', 'music', 'score', 'clever', 'imagination', 'make', 'feel', 'are', 'transported', 'Vienna', 'circa', '1900', 'watch', 'story', 'unfold', 'magic', 'illusion', 'suspense', 'Eisenheim', 'shows', 'take', 'much', 'darker', 'feel', 'can', 'reach', 'other', 'world', 'find', 'out', 'information', 'lost', 'loved', 'great', 'job', 'filmmaking', 'storytelling', 'here', 'definitely', 'art-like', 'quality', 'Illusionist', 'more', 'eye']",N/A

However, ""The Illusionist"" turned out to be far better than the well-touted movie that I bought in the first place. Furthermore, after the first few minutes, I found myself becoming totally absorbed in the suspenseful story, which is well acted (Perhaps Edward Norton's openhanded gesture as the brooding illusionist Eisenstein cast a hypnotic spell over me!). I especially liked Paul Giamatti as the Inspector. The costumes are splendid (except for the klutzy jodhpurs that Jessica Biel wears in the otherwise romantic last scene). In the rest of the movie, she is lovely, as are the ""Viennese"" settings in Prague (which has become a period-movie substitute for any city that was largely flattened during World War II). I was so engaged by Eisenstein's illusions (aided by Philip Glass's compelling musical score) that I suspended my disbelief (especially my sharply-honed sense of historical disbelief) and was both surprised and delighted by the ending (and they did have a crude pre-electric heat-powered magic lantern show in the 19th century, to answer one reviewer's objection). My only real complaint has to do with the over-saturation of the colors in the cinematography. As the director explains in his commentary (which demonstrates that magic explained is no longer magic), the color was done in such a way to give the film an antique look, but the fact that I was constantly aware of this particular special effect indicates that it may have been overdone.

1032309,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000K7VHPU,Grady Harp,"[2, 4]","Steven Millhauser's brilliant little short story 'Eisenheim the Illusionist' is beautifully realized cinematically by Neil Burger who not only adapted the story as a screenplay but also directed with a great flair for the subject.  Wisely using the repeated line 'Nothing is what it seems' Burger infuses this dark investigation into the lives of the divided Viennese classes and suggests the crumbling of the Austro-Hungarian Empire with the focus on the illusory magic of one Eisenheim (finely characterized by Edward Norton) and its effects on the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) and the bifurcated Duchess Sophie (Jessica Biel).As children  Eisenheim and Sophie were friends despite the disparity of their class: Sophie was royalty (a Duchess) and Eisenheim was the son of a cabinetmaker to the court.  They fall in love but are separated by caste and Eisenheim wanders Asia and Russia learning the vagaries of magic and illusionist tricks while Sophie is raised at court to become the wife of Crown Prince Leopold, whose plans to overthrow his father the Emperor to become the King of both Austria and Hungary have made him an obsessive scoundrel.Years later Eisenheim enters Vienna as a showman, under the tutelage of his impresario Josef Fischer (Eddie Marsan),  delighting audiences with his illusionist tricks.  His impossible love for Sophie resurfaces and he becomes suspect in his role as an illusionist and as a threat tot he Crown.  Eisenheim is investigated carefully by Chief Police Inspector Uhl (a brilliant role by Paul Giamatti) and the manner in which the fates of the Crown versus the love of Eisenheim and Sophie are resolved is, well, 'Nothing is what it seems'.The cast is outstanding, the setting (in Prague) is incredibly atmospheric, and the costuming and lighting and cinematography marry into a perfect fit.  Adding to the illusionist spirit of the film is the fine musical score by Phillip Glass so well loved for his score for 'The Hours' and one of our most important classical music composers of the day.  THE ILLUSIONIST is a fine, misty, dark evocation of life in La Belle &Eacute;poque of Vienna, based enough on fact that the fiction employs the concept that nothing is what it seems.

Edward Norton plays the great illusionist, Eisenheim who finds his childhood love, Sophie played by Jessica Biel is engaged to Crown Prince Leopold played by Rufus Sewell. The city's Chief Inspector Uhl and the prince become obsessed with Eisenheim's association with Sophie and how his illusions are done until a mysterious crime takes place and a major investigation begins.The special effects are amazing in this movie and the Blu-Ray quality only adds to the magic. The acting is pretty top-notch bringing American, English, and German actors all towards a soft Viennese accent. Edward Norton is wonderfully guarded and mysterious throughout the film and learned some of the hand trickery from actual magicians. Paul Giamatti is characteristically gruff, but at times difficult to understand and awkward. His eyes say volumes about what his lines don't reveal. Jessica Biel is beautiful and keeps it simple which seems to be the best way to play it in this case. This was one of her first roles outside the norm of popular romantic comedy and television fare. Rufus Sewell has an admirable performance as the villain, all of whose lines could be taken as guilty or innocent, but he could have been a little more menacing or crazy. The story is like a well-played chess game with Eisenheim always a few steps ahead of his pursuers and a very enjoyable ride.Bonus Features:The bonus features are ONLY on the DVD, not the Blu-Ray disc. They include feature length commentary with writer/director Niel Burger, the Making of The Illusionist, and Jessica Biel on the Illusionist. The commentary by Burger is very interesting since he explains how each illusion would be done and points out some historical facts about the shooting location and its connections to Archduke Ferdinand whose death began World War I.The making of featurette is less than four minutes long and it is just a series of the main actors explaining their characters and the plot. The Jessica Biel segment has the same interviews as in the ""making of"" featurette with a few more seconds of her saying she sought out the film since it was the next type of project she wanted to do and lasts less than two minutes.This combo allows you to get what is already available on DVD with no further extras, except a Blu-Ray disc with fantastic picture to make the illusions even more illusion-y!",4,This whodunit illusion looks even better on Blu-Ray,1277078400,"06 21, 2010",2010,2610,"['IllusionistBlu-Ray/DVD', 'Combo', 'PackNewly', 'released', 'Blu-Ray', 'June', '8th', 'Illusionist', 'was', 'originally', 'released', '2006', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Neil', 'Burger', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Eisenheim', 'Illusionist', 'written', 'Steven', 'Millhauser', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'great', 'illusionist', 'Eisenheim', 'who', 'childhood', 'love', 'Sophie', 'played', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'engaged', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'played', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'city', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'prince', 'become', 'obsessed', 'Eisenheim', 'association', 'Sophie', 'how', 'illusions', 'are', 'done', 'mysterious', 'crime', 'place', 'major', 'investigation', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'amazing', 'movie', 'Blu-Ray', 'quality', 'only', 'magic', 'acting', 'pretty', 'top-notch', 'bringing', 'American', 'English', 'German', 'actors', 'towards', 'soft', 'Viennese', 'accent', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'wonderfully', 'guarded', 'mysterious', 'film', 'learned', 'hand', 'trickery', 'actual', 'magicians', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'characteristically', 'gruff', 'times', 'difficult', 'understand', 'awkward', 'eyes', 'say', 'volumes', 'what', 'lines', 'do', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'beautiful', 'simple', 'be', 'best', 'way', 'play', 'case', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'roles', 'norm', 'popular', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'television', 'fare', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'admirable', 'performance', 'villain', 'lines', 'could', 'be', 'taken', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'menacing', 'crazy', 'story', 'well-played', 'chess', 'game', 'Eisenheim', 'always', 'few', 'steps', 'ahead', 'pursuers', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'ride.Bonus', 'Features', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'ONLY', 'DVD', 'not', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'include', 'feature', 'length', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Niel', 'Burger', 'Making', 'Illusionist', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Illusionist', 'commentary', 'Burger', 'very', 'interesting', 'how', 'illusion', 'would', 'be', 'done', 'points', 'out', 'historical', 'facts', 'shooting', 'location', 'connections', 'Archduke', 'Ferdinand', 'death', 'began', 'World', 'War', 'I.The', 'making', 'featurette', 'less', 'four', 'minutes', 'long', 'just', 'series', 'main', 'actors', 'explaining', 'characters', 'plot', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'segment', 'same', 'interviews', 'making', 'featurette', 'few', 'more', 'seconds', 'saying', 'sought', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'next', 'type', 'project', 'wanted', 'do', 'less', 'two', 'minutes.This', 'combo', 'get', 'what', 'already', 'available', 'DVD', 'further', 'extras', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'fantastic', 'picture', 'make', 'illusions', 'even', 'more', 'illusion-y']",N/A

Aside from that, it's like comparing apples with oranges, Moby Dick with Jaws, fruit salad with a hot fudge sundae. These two movies have two different purposes and two different world views. Both succeeded equally well at what they aimed at accomplishing.I recently read ""Saving Leonardo"" by Nancy Pearcey, where she follows two differing philosophical trends: the Enlightenment tradition and the Romanitic tradition. ""The Illusionist"" fits clearly into the Romantic setting. The rational explanation of what is going on is not important. The protagonist left the explanation for a trick for the antagoist (a superb job by Paul Giamiati), but the audience never knows how plausible that is. Some of the effects in fact cross into the spiritual/magical realm.The philosophy also reveals itself in the story telling. This movie has a very identifiable hero, villain, love-interest, and antagonist. The purpose of this movie is to be an old-fashioned romantic story, without any real agenda than being an enjoyable couple of hours. The only complaints is that this reflects a modern view of morality, where there's no problem with the hero having sex with the love interest without being married to her, as well as some occultish tones.""The Prestige"" is much more realistic than the ""Illusionist"", and I personally consider it to be the better movie.

For once I could go see a movie without having to see car chases, gratuitous sex, or anything exploding. This is a quiet, thoughtful, lovely film that held my interest from start to finish. It is the tale of Eisenheim the Illusionist whose inexplicable magic shows have the whole city of Vienna abuzz. Eisenheim's childhood sweetheart is the beautiful Sophie who is about to be manouevered into a political marriage to the frightening Crown Prince Leopold. While the movie never explains how Eisenheim performs most of his puzzling tricks, that's not the point. The film muses on the idea of what is real and what is illusory and how do we know the difference. Paul Giamatti as Police Inspector Uhl is our escort through the strange goings-on, and we see the story (or at least some of it) unfold through his skeptical, practical eyes. I won't add any spoilers except to say that the movie has plot twists and surprises up its sleeve that, while they may not shock you, will probably leave you smiling in the end. After seeing this movie three times so far, I can say it's never been the same movie twice for me. With each time I watch it, I find a new nuance to the story (this last time, I was struck by what the movie has to say about aristocracy and democracy).

Rufus Sewell is delicious as the bad guy (sans those luscious curls this time) and Jessica Biel proves to be far more than just a pretty face.

Eisenhiem seems to be one step ahead at all times, ready for the inquisitive and the doubters, even the Inspector General, the man who is supposed to know all secrets of the area.What eventually happens is that the Prince orders the Inspector General, Uhl, to shut down Eisenhiem's show, because the Prince doesn't like the competition.

And it makes it that much more difficult to suspend disbelief and imagine the 19th century audience watching Eisenheim's magic act gasping and being astounded at what they see. The other flaw, though, is that the plot (which I won't give away) has enough holes to drive a truck through, holes that attempt to be dressed up by beautiful if vapid cinematography and editing that would do most television commercials proud.

I would have loved to see real illusions performed, rather than the cgi nonsense seen here. Watching a movie about magic, I'd much prefer to see David Blaine-like illusions rather than these hopelessly physics and reason-defying jokes. And having a book with Michaelangelo-like diagrams in it showing how the trick is built makes no difference. They are stupid and irritating.Many have pointed out how lovely this film is. That it certainly is. It looks great, and I never grew tired of the soft focus and sepia haze. Costumes, swords, helmets, trains, stage lighting, carriages all looked superlative. But look only goes so far. Phillip Glass has indeed cannibalized his previous work, though at least the score was not annoying. And we can debate whether this or that actor was good or bad. For my taste, Edward Norton was just too cold and cerebral; why would this woman love him? But generally I accepted the performances.No, a film like this lives or dies on plot, and if anyone was surprised by the ending, they must have been sleeping. I too was hoping some better illusion was impending, one that hadn't been telgraphed, telephoned, billboarded, and announced in any number of ways. But no, the ending we all thought was coming came chugging in, right on schedule, with all the remarkable coincidences and unlikely events (good thing the Prince didn't drink just a bit more, or less, of that potion, and oh, the convenient Friar Lawrence magic worked a little better here than for Romeo and Juliet) tidily cleaned up in fast-forward.So a beautiful film that promised a lot and didn't quite deliver.

The biggest disappointment to me is that the tricks were all special effects. You don't know whether the illusionist is a trickster or a supernaturalist. The movie really never explains. I'm sure that confusion is intended. Some of the tricks defy explanation in the conventional sense in 19th century Vienna. The only thing ""The Prestige"" has over this movie is that some of the tricks were explained.

It's not particularly deep - nor is it necessarily all that brilliant. But, like any good conjurer's trick, this film is entertaining. The high points are the production design and the acting. Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti speak in weirdly soft tones for much of the film, but they manage to convey a wide range of emotions anyway, and both of them play very compelling characters. I had no problem with Jessica Biel, either, perhaps because I never saw her ""teen"" movies and I'm not saddled with the preconception that she's a lightweight. Let me put it this way; she's certainly beautiful enough that I understand Norton's obsession with her!The script is simple and a bit fanciful. The plot twists are not too hard to predict, if you really want to predict them. But so what? I enjoyed the movie even though I suspected what the ending would probably be. And, unlike many commentators on this site, I didn't feel ""superior"" to the film simply because I figured out the mystery. Sometimes it's fun to watch even a predictable plot unfold.I'm actually glad that Norton made a film like this, because I usually associate him with darker, more downbeat fare. ""The Illusionist"" is a very pleasant movie by his standards - like a dreamy sort of fairy tale. I enjoyed seeing him in something that's so much fun.

It was also beautifully photographed.  What left me with a bad taste, though, was the inexplicable perfection of the deception.  By the end, we realize the extent of the ruse, but there are too many unanswered questions about how it was pulled off.First, every illusion shown bordered on the supernatual.  There was no attempt to explain any of them to the audience's satisifaction.  Even the ""Orange Tree"" diagram did not account for the tree's ability to grow real oranges.  It was clear that the illusions transcended the technology of that time--and probably that of ours too.  For example, holograms are right out of Star Trek, but we are asked to believe they were perfected in 1900 Vienna.  The Prestige, another excellent movie about turn-of-the-century magicians, also had seemingly inexplicable feats, but at least let the viewer in on the secrets.Second, the master deception required a level of manipulation that had far more to do with psychology than illusion.  Eisenheim had to know exactly what Uhl was going to do and when he was going to do it.  Ditto with Crown Prince Leopold.  Can such an intricate plan depend on such a thing and succeed?  I doubt it, unless Eisheim had mastered hypnosis (actually mass hypnosis is a plausible explanation for much of the film).The ending also left me wondering how bad the Crown Prince really was.

1032349,A168VXSISJWQN9,B000K7VHPU,"John D. Muir ""oldies and pies lover""","[1, 1]","This is a well-crafted, well-acted subtle little movie which makes some very interesting observations on society, contains an intriguing mystery and features a wonderful performance from one of my favorite actors, Paul Giamatti.Set in Vienna (but actually filmed in and around Prague) in 1900, the movie is about a couple of childhood friends from very different social classes- the son of a cabinet-maker and Sophie, a royal princess. Their friendship is forcibly ended by the princess's family, but 15 years later the boy, now a man, reappears as an illusionist. They meet again and realize that they are in love; but how to separate themselves from the inevitable backlash against such a misalliance?The movie is told from the perspective of Inspector Uhl (Giamatti), a policeman responsible for security in the royal household. He reports to Crown Prince Leopold (the splendidly menacing Rufus Sewell), heir to the throne and a jealous and violent man, who wishes to marry Princess Sophie (Jessica Biel). When Eisenheim the illusionist (Edward Norton) delivers a number of barely veiled insults to the Crown Prince, Uhl is ordered to get rid of him. There follows a battle of wits between Uhl and Eisenheim, in which Uhl holds all the cards but Eisenheim tries to manipulate how they are played.The movie succeeds on many levels. It's atmospheric and gives the feel of a period piece; it points out the class distinctions of the time when it was literally possible for the Crown Prince to get away with murder; it takes a subtle dig at those who are obsessed by the supernatural and believe they are seeing something paranormal even when assured it is an illusion; the illusions are realistic and actually could have been performed at the time; and it uses misdirection as cleverly as Eisenheim himself. Interestingly, some of the interior scenes were filmed at the home of Arch-Duke Ferdinand of Sarajevo, whose assassination was the flashpoint for the start of World War One.The mistake the movie could have made, but happily didn't, is to make Uhl an unworthy opponent for Eisenheim. Instead, the two men respect each other and Eisenheim knows that nothing less than his best will fool the inspector. Moreover, Uhl is not an unlikeable man and throughout the film he faces an internal battle between his responsibilities and his personal inclinations. The final scene, in which Inspector Uhl mentally reviews all the facts and clues, is a brilliant piece of acting by Giamatti and leaves us thoroughly uplifted.Although a number of reviews compare this movie to 'The Prestige', which came out at about the same time, the movies are quite unlike each other except superficially- they both involve stage illusionists and are set at the end of the 19th century. This is the smaller, more intimate film, but just as effective in its own way.

The setting is 1900 Vienna with the Austro-Hungarian Empire in full swing. The illusionist develops a cult following among the people which irks the Crown Prince.

Compared to the other film ""The Prestige"" it's not quite as good, but nevertheless...I enjoyed it a lot. Sporting an English accent and a beard, Norton plays Eisenheim the Illusionist who frequently amazes the city of Vienna with his realistic trickery. The movie opens with Inspector Uhl (Giamatti) arresting Eisenheim at one of his performances and the movie flashes back to show us why. One night, during a performance Eisenheim is reunited with a childhood acquaintance in the form of Duchess Sophie (Biel), who is engaged to marry Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). Despite this, Sophie and Eisenheim begin having an affair, which leads to Sophie being murdered by Leopold. Inspector Uhl, who is caught in the middle of all this, begins investigating the murder while Eisenheim appears to be resurrecting her at his shows. The movie's climax is a ""twist"" that bares some similarity to the ending of ""The Prestige."" Both endings are good, but a bit contrived and don't make a whole lot of sense. They do, but it seems too unbelievable. The movie is beautiful and, at times, has the look of an old silent film. All the performances are good, especially Norton and Giamatti. Biel, who is frequently bashed by critics, is actually really good and really hot. Sewell always makes a top-notch villain (except in ""The Legend of Zorro"") and looks kind of Vincent Gallo-ish. The movie's very entertaining, even if you're not into period pieces where people wear makeup on their chest and write with feathers.

We cared for the illusionist and his lover, their struggles and their dreams. The acting is another highlight in this film. All the main characters are believable. Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti have good chemistry on screen.The ending will shock you, but in a good way we believe.

1032368,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000K7VHPU,Kaya Savas,"[0, 2]","MOVIE: I walked into The Illusionist not expecting much, mostly because it had Jessica Biel in a serious role, but I was pleasently surprised by this period/fantasy piece. The film is from director Niel Burger and this is his sophomore directing attempt. The film is told through third person narrative from Paul Giammatti's character. The film opens as the Chief Inspector (Giammatti) is having a meeting with Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). The audience learns that Eisenheim The Illusionist (Edward Norton) is threatening the power of the Crown Prince and may uncover the secret plot to overthrow the King. So, at this point the Chief Inspector tells the story of Eisenheim and we return back to the meeting scene later in the film's third act. The story is Shakespearean in that Eisenheim falls in love with Sophie (Jessica Biel) who is a girl in a much higher social class than he is. After he is forbidden to see her, he departs on a journey where he learns the tricks of being a performer and takes the stage name of Eisenheim The Illusionist. The story has been done, but the film was well executed. The time and setting also bring a fresh approach to this tried and true love story, plus we have the theme of illusion. We quickly learn that things are not what they seem as the power craving Crown Prince plans to overthrow the King and forcefully marry Sophie in order to do so. The film's ending is quite predictable, or at least you know that there is going to be a twist ending even though you may not figure it out. There is also the fact that the narrative structure of the film was incredibly confusing. I didn't figure out that the story was told through Giammatti's character as a flashback until we came back to the present. It seems like a pretty standard linear story, but every now and then Giammatti's character will pop in and narrate for two minutes then dissapear. It happens maybe 3 or 4 times in the entire movie, which makes it very confusing and awkward. However, the film is visually stunning. The sets and the costumes are particularly breathtaking and really captivate the audience. Look for a costume nomination come Oscar time, I'm calling it right now.ACTING: Okay, plain and simple, Paul Giammatti outweighs all the other actors and steals the show with a brilliant performance. This is his best work since Sideways and he proves once again that he is an amazing character actor. Edward Norton is very good as well, but he is sort of drowned out by Giammatti. Unfortunetly Jessica Biel still can't act and can't hold a Dutch accent if her life depended on it. Rufus Sewell is delightfully evil as always as the Crown Prince. Seems like he will be playing the bad guy for the rest of his life, but at least he's good at it.BOTTOM LINE: Some confusing plot structure in the narration and uneven acting in the supporting roles hinder the film. However, the movie itself is a visual feast, its lavish sets and incredible costume design really create the perfect atmosphere that makes The Illusionist worth your while.",4,"Confusing Plot Structure Hinders The Film A Tad, But Overall A Great Period Piece / Love Story With Shakespearean Qualities",1158019200,"09 12, 2006",2006,3055,"['MOVIE', 'walked', 'Illusionist', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'mostly', 'had', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'serious', 'role', 'was', 'pleasently', 'surprised', 'period/fantasy', 'piece', 'film', 'director', 'Niel', 'Burger', 'sophomore', 'directing', 'attempt', 'film', 'told', 'third', 'person', 'narrative', 'Paul', 'Giammatti', 'character', 'film', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Giammatti', 'having', 'meeting', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'audience', 'Eisenheim', 'Illusionist', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'threatening', 'power', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'may', 'uncover', 'secret', 'plot', 'overthrow', 'King', 'So', 'point', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'story', 'Eisenheim', 'return', 'back', 'meeting', 'scene', 'later', 'film', 'third', 'act', 'story', 'Shakespearean', 'Eisenheim', 'love', 'Sophie', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'who', 'girl', 'much', 'higher', 'social', 'class', 'forbidden', 'see', 'journey', 'where', 'tricks', 'being', 'performer', 'stage', 'name', 'Eisenheim', 'Illusionist', 'story', 'been', 'done', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'executed', 'time', 'setting', 'also', 'bring', 'fresh', 'approach', 'tried', 'true', 'love', 'story', 'have', 'theme', 'illusion', 'quickly', 'learn', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'seem', 'power', 'craving', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'overthrow', 'King', 'forcefully', 'marry', 'Sophie', 'order', 'do', 'so', 'film', 'ending', 'quite', 'predictable', 'least', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'twist', 'ending', 'even', 'may', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'also', 'fact', 'narrative', 'structure', 'film', 'was', 'incredibly', 'confusing', 'did', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'Giammatti', 'character', 'flashback', 'came', 'back', 'present', 'pretty', 'standard', 'linear', 'story', 'now', 'then', 'Giammatti', 'character', 'will', 'pop', 'narrate', 'two', 'minutes', 'then', 'dissapear', 'maybe', '3', '4', 'times', 'entire', 'movie', 'very', 'confusing', 'awkward', 'However', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'particularly', 'breathtaking', 'really', 'captivate', 'audience', 'Look', 'costume', 'nomination', 'come', 'Oscar', 'time', ""'m"", 'calling', 'right', 'now.ACTING', 'Okay', 'plain', 'simple', 'Paul', 'Giammatti', 'other', 'actors', 'show', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'best', 'work', 'Sideways', 'once', 'again', 'amazing', 'character', 'actor', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'sort', 'drowned', 'out', 'Giammatti', 'Unfortunetly', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'Dutch', 'accent', 'life', 'depended', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'delightfully', 'evil', 'as', 'always', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'will', 'be', 'playing', 'bad', 'guy', 'rest', 'life', 'least', 'good', 'it.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'confusing', 'plot', 'structure', 'narration', 'uneven', 'acting', 'supporting', 'roles', 'hinder', 'film', 'However', 'movie', 'visual', 'feast', 'lavish', 'sets', 'incredible', 'costume', 'design', 'really', 'create', 'perfect', 'Illusionist', 'while']",N/A
1032369,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,B000K7VHPU,K. Boullosa,"[9, 9]","I was taken by surprise when I saw this film - I had read Steven Millhauser's short story, on which it is based, but had missed the film when it came out.  The film takes the bare bones of the short story and imposes upon them the intense childhood attachment between Eisenheim and his aristocratic neighbor, and the ensuing romance touching the core of the Hapsburg dynasty shortly before it and its empire go down to ruin.  Neither the childhood romance nor the rivalry with the Hapsburg heir appears in the short story.  I am usually outraged when original literary works receive such treatment by Hollywood.  However, in this case, I was rewarded with a lovely, romantic jewel of a film that works quite well on its own terms.  The script begs one or two narrative questions, but this is one of the rare cases in which these don't matter much, overall.  Contrary to the opinion expressed by a reviewer below, in my opinion the film is defined by the sense of hidden strength and longing with which Edward Norton imbues Eisenheim.  The broken childhood attachment that convinces him to follow his calling as a magician, and the later reunification with his lost love that this choice brings about, make for a very satisfying journey, indeed.  It is precisely Eisenheim's ability to hide his thoughts, his canny self-control, and his relationship to his magic (which is to say, his broader view of what is possible and what is not), and their ultimate triumph over blunt authority and the social order, that make the film so appealing.The rest of the cast is very good, as well, particularly Paul Giammati as the police inspector and Rufus Sewell as the unstable and vicious Crown Prince Leopold.  Jessica Biel is the weakest leak in this chain as Eisenham's (adult) love: her ""Viennese"" accent slips the most often, and she is not as charismatic as Norton, but she does well enough and doesn't spoil the movie.  The film is set in Vienna in 1910, and the American actors, as well as the British Sewell, were coached to produce a ""Viennese"" accent, but it isn't, quite, and the result among the Americans is an inconsistent sound that is neither British nor Viennese, and which Biel, in particular, had trouble maintaining.  There are a few narrative weakness.  One is the Duchess not recognizing Eisenham, the love of her youth, 15 years later as she stares into his eyes on stage - he was already an extraordinary young magician when she first knew him and already possessed of an adult voice. Then there is the little matter of the Duchess's exit, apparently with no questions from the noble family who presumably would have wished to bury her!  But these quibbles, somehow, are easily set aside in the somewhat fairy-tale-like atmosphere of the film, which was imaginatively shot in sepia tones that enhanced this.  This eerie atmosphere is also greatly enhanced by Philip Glass's delicate, mysterious score.  Romantics, rebels, and dreamers everywhere will appreciate the themes of this film as expressed through the relationships among the characters.  The magical effects, of course, are enhanced by the wonders of computer technology.  One is aware of this while watching, but doesn't care.A charming and romantic film with a truly unique feel to it, highly recommended.",4,If Only Life Were Like This!,1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,3280,"['was', 'taken', 'surprise', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'had', 'read', 'Steven', 'Millhauser', 'short', 'story', 'based', 'had', 'missed', 'film', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'film', 'bare', 'bones', 'short', 'story', 'intense', 'childhood', 'attachment', 'Eisenheim', 'aristocratic', 'neighbor', 'ensuing', 'romance', 'touching', 'core', 'Hapsburg', 'dynasty', 'shortly', 'empire', 'go', 'down', 'ruin', 'childhood', 'romance', 'rivalry', 'Hapsburg', 'heir', 'short', 'story', 'am', 'usually', 'outraged', 'when', 'original', 'literary', 'works', 'receive', 'such', 'treatment', 'Hollywood', 'However', 'case', 'was', 'rewarded', 'lovely', 'romantic', 'jewel', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'own', 'terms', 'script', 'one', 'two', 'narrative', 'questions', 'one', 'rare', 'cases', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much', 'overall', 'Contrary', 'opinion', 'expressed', 'reviewer', 'opinion', 'film', 'defined', 'sense', 'hidden', 'strength', 'longing', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Eisenheim', 'broken', 'childhood', 'attachment', 'follow', 'calling', 'magician', 'later', 'reunification', 'lost', 'love', 'choice', 'make', 'very', 'satisfying', 'journey', 'indeed', 'precisely', 'Eisenheim', 'ability', 'hide', 'thoughts', 'canny', 'self-control', 'relationship', 'magic', 'say', 'broader', 'view', 'what', 'possible', 'what', 'not', 'ultimate', 'triumph', 'blunt', 'authority', 'social', 'order', 'make', 'film', 'so', 'appealing.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'particularly', 'Paul', 'Giammati', 'police', 'inspector', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'unstable', 'vicious', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'weakest', 'leak', 'chain', 'Eisenham', 'adult', 'love', 'Viennese', 'accent', 'most', 'often', 'not', 'as', 'charismatic', 'Norton', 'well', 'enough', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'movie', 'film', 'set', 'Vienna', '1910', 'American', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'British', 'Sewell', 'were', 'coached', 'produce', 'Viennese', 'accent', ""n't"", 'quite', 'result', 'Americans', 'inconsistent', 'sound', 'British', 'Viennese', 'Biel', 'particular', 'had', 'trouble', 'maintaining', 'are', 'few', 'narrative', 'weakness', 'One', 'Duchess', 'not', 'recognizing', 'Eisenham', 'love', 'youth', '15', 'years', 'later', 'eyes', 'stage', 'was', 'already', 'extraordinary', 'young', 'magician', 'when', 'first', 'knew', 'already', 'possessed', 'adult', 'voice', 'Then', 'little', 'matter', 'Duchess', 'exit', 'apparently', 'questions', 'noble', 'family', 'who', 'presumably', 'would', 'have', 'wished', 'bury', 'quibbles', 'somehow', 'are', 'easily', 'set', 'aside', 'somewhat', 'fairy-tale-like', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'was', 'imaginatively', 'shot', 'sepia', 'tones', 'enhanced', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'also', 'greatly', 'enhanced', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'delicate', 'mysterious', 'score', 'Romantics', 'rebels', 'dreamers', 'everywhere', 'will', 'appreciate', 'themes', 'film', 'expressed', 'relationships', 'characters', 'magical', 'effects', 'course', 'are', 'enhanced', 'wonders', 'computer', 'technology', 'One', 'aware', 'while', 'watching', ""n't"", 'care.A', 'charming', 'romantic', 'film', 'truly', 'unique', 'feel', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Norman ""li'l rock & roller""","[73, 84]","Set in Vienna, filmed in Prague,and just about as lovely as anything I've seen on the large screen, ""The Illusionist"" stars Edward Norton as a charismatic magician, and Jessica Biel as his high-born love interest. In keeping with its magic and later, occult, theme, the film unwinds through shadow and darkness, like a carriage being horsedrawn through fin-de-siecle Europe's narrow streets.  Philip Glass's minimalist score, rather than acting as an anachronism as one might expect, enhances the ethereal, other-worldly quality.  Edward Norton brings to Eisenheim, the central character (the book is based on the short story ""Eisenheim, the Illusionist"", by Steven Millhauser)an understated quality that adds to the sense that he always knows more than we do...and more than the characters in the film, including the two that most want to undo his works of magic, Inspector Uhl and Crown Prince Leopold. Unfortunately, the latter is engaged to Dutchess Sophie van Teschen, Biel's character.  Leopold's intent is not only to prevent his lower class rival's success, but to control Sophie completely.  Uhl, on the other hand, continues to respect Eisenheim, even as he is carrying out the Crown Prince's orders to shut the magician's show down.As the tale unwinds (and it does ever more quickly as it moves toward the end), we do learn more and more about what lies behind Eisenheim's sad eyes.  When Sophie's body turns up in the river after an argument with Leopold, Eisenheim's shows take on a dark change and he becomes kind of a ""John Edwards"" of the 19th century...but this John Edwards can summon holographic ghosts onto the stage, much to the delight of his audience.  Is he becoming more and more obsessed and perhaps insane as Sophie begins to appear in these seances?  In a twinkling, we find out as much about Eisenheim as we have during the entire film, and the lines in the Sophie-Leopold-Eisenheim triangle between the innocent and the devious aren't so clear.A film to be savored.",5,Sepia-toned Beauty in Mystery and Passion,1158969600,"09 23, 2006",2006,1995,"['Set', 'Vienna', 'filmed', 'Prague', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'lovely', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'large', 'screen', 'Illusionist', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'charismatic', 'magician', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'high-born', 'love', 'interest', 'keeping', 'magic', 'later', 'occult', 'theme', 'film', 'shadow', 'darkness', 'carriage', 'being', 'horsedrawn', 'fin-de-siecle', 'Europe', 'narrow', 'streets', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'minimalist', 'score', 'rather', 'acting', 'anachronism', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'ethereal', 'other-worldly', 'quality', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Eisenheim', 'central', 'character', 'book', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Eisenheim', 'Illusionist', 'Steven', 'Millhauser', 'understated', 'quality', 'sense', 'always', 'more', 'do', 'more', 'characters', 'film', 'including', 'two', 'most', 'want', 'undo', 'works', 'magic', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'Unfortunately', 'latter', 'engaged', 'Dutchess', 'Sophie', 'van', 'Teschen', 'Biel', 'character', 'Leopold', 'intent', 'not', 'only', 'prevent', 'lower', 'class', 'rival', 'success', 'control', 'Sophie', 'completely', 'Uhl', 'other', 'hand', 'respect', 'Eisenheim', 'even', 'carrying', 'out', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'orders', 'shut', 'magician', 'show', 'tale', 'unwinds', 'ever', 'more', 'quickly', 'end', 'do', 'learn', 'more', 'more', 'what', 'Eisenheim', 'sad', 'eyes', 'When', 'Sophie', 'body', 'up', 'river', 'argument', 'Leopold', 'Eisenheim', 'shows', 'take', 'dark', 'change', 'kind', 'John', 'Edwards', '19th', 'century', 'John', 'Edwards', 'can', 'summon', 'holographic', 'ghosts', 'stage', 'much', 'delight', 'audience', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'obsessed', 'perhaps', 'insane', 'Sophie', 'appear', 'seances', 'twinkling', 'find', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'Eisenheim', 'have', 'entire', 'film', 'lines', 'Sophie-Leopold-Eisenheim', 'triangle', 'innocent', 'devious', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'clear.A', 'film', 'be', 'savored']",N/A

(When is the era, anyhow?  Though Eisenheim uses actual firepots to illuminate his act, it must be set somewhat after the age of electricity, for Paul Giamatti's police constables produce from nowhere a fully operative movie projector and switch it on!)  (And on an adjoining screen we see a sophisticated, and Technicolor moving image years before Technicolor was actually invented!)  Like Coppola's DRACULA, or like the recent musical MOULIN ROUGE, director Neil Burger brings in the flaws and cracks of silent era film, and instantly takes us back to the day, though it's not 100 per cent convincing.

But that's standard movie practice today, the way that, if one's only exposure to New York City was through the cinema, you would be forgiven for thinking it looks exactly like Toronto.Anyhow I soon found myself caught up in the story, and to my surprise, Paul Giamatti was much better than he's been in years, and as for Jessica Biel, well, she has a new spring in her step, and she repays the confidence Burger placed in her, for her part couldn't have been an easy one and yet she's truthful and honest in nearly every scene.  Does Ed Norton ever hold a ball of light as he does on the DVD cover and poster?  I don't think so, but the one pose Eisenheim falls into, arm extended, fingers charging the air around his hand with electricity, is a commanding, Universal horror one.  It might also have been invented by Karloff or Lugosi, and yet Norton carries it off.Who was that actress from Canada who used to be in every other spooky sort of art movie, like Cronenberg's CRASH or Fincher's THE GAME--and she looked like a prototype for Jessica Biel, with the same unseeing eyes and fat, bruised lips?  I know, I know, Deborah Kara Unger.  She wouldn't have been bad either.  She's so great and I haven't seen her since WHITE NOISE.In THE ILLUSIONIST, is it just me, or how bad is Burger's dialogue whenever Jessica Biel is addressed?  She's playing Sophie, the Duchess von Teschen.  Does this mean that fellow noblewomen will be saying, ""Your dress is so pretty, Duchess von Teschen!""  The best is when she goes missing and the Vienna Woods swarm with volunteers all calling out, ""Duchess von Teschen!  Duchess von Teschen!""

The music fits perfectly. The story is weak... at least that part which we are privy to. And that is the problem here.We, the audience, are not privy to anything. We are entertained by the illusionist throughout the story... not even a crumb of something is thrown at us with which to relish. We know less than half the characters in the story.Only until the final 5 minutes are we given any sort of explanation. And I feel we are cheated by that. What is never explained are the ghost-like figures that The Illusionist summons up in his performances and which he uses to escape by. Not a nice thing to do guys... after all... you are playing to us.What I did like was the costumes and sets.... brilliant and very eloquent. It was reminiscent of Doctor Zhivago in that the period was displayed very well.The acting was very very good also. Norton and the rest played well off each other in a very convincing manner.But... the story lacks. And to have a quick, flashback style explanation was insulting, hence the low points.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 5]","Edward Norton heads up a wonderful cast which includes Rufus Sewell, Paul Giamatti and Jessica Biel in ""The Illusionist.""  It's a wonderful story of just how far a man will go to get back to the love of his life.  Norton portrays Eisenheim, an illusionist who has a penchant for bizarre, almost supernatural magic tricks that captivate his audience.  As a teen, he falls for a young duchess (Biel).  However, he being the poor son of commoners and she being royalty, their love is forbidden and the two are separated for what seems like forever.As the story unfolds, we learn that Eisenheim has found his lovely duchess, but she is to wed Crown Prince Leopold (Sewell), a hateful, cocky man who is intent on scientifically and logically explaining all of Norton's magical acts.  Naturally, the Eisenheim and Duchess Sophie begin to meet secretly, only to have Leopold dispatch Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti) and his goons to find out what's really happening.  From there, the story begins to twist and turn.  It's full of deceit, rage, romance, and even a little bit of humor.  I can't speak much more about it or I'll give away too much.Norton is superb.  His lovelorn character becomes progressively sicker as the story unfolds, and he exerts all of his energy to reclaim the love of his life.  Biel does a wonderful job even though her accent isn't the most believable.  She carries off the role of royalty very well.  Giamatti is perfect as Uhl, who not only investigates the matter at hand, but narrates the story as well.  You don't know if you should root for him or pray that he gets his just desserts.  Sewell delivers, in my opinion, the top performance in this story.  He's arrogant, vengeful, and a baldfaced liar to boot.  His actions keep this story moving along at an acceptable pace.Overall, this film is well deserving of four-and-one-half stars.  It's a great flick that combines forbidden love, deceit, violence, and a little bit of magic all into one.  It's a definite keeper, and I give it my ""must buy"" seal of approval.",5,A Simply Enjoyable Film,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,2042,"['Edward', 'Norton', 'up', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Illusionist', 'wonderful', 'story', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'man', 'will', 'go', 'get', 'back', 'love', 'life', 'Norton', 'Eisenheim', 'illusionist', 'who', 'penchant', 'bizarre', 'almost', 'supernatural', 'magic', 'tricks', 'captivate', 'audience', 'teen', 'young', 'duchess', 'Biel', 'However', 'being', 'poor', 'son', 'commoners', 'being', 'royalty', 'love', 'forbidden', 'two', 'are', 'separated', 'what', 'forever.As', 'story', 'unfolds', 'learn', 'Eisenheim', 'found', 'lovely', 'duchess', 'wed', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'Sewell', 'hateful', 'cocky', 'man', 'who', 'intent', 'scientifically', 'logically', 'explaining', 'Norton', 'magical', 'acts', 'Naturally', 'Eisenheim', 'Duchess', 'Sophie', 'begin', 'meet', 'secretly', 'only', 'have', 'Leopold', 'dispatch', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'Giamatti', 'goons', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happening', 'there', 'story', 'twist', 'turn', 'full', 'deceit', 'rage', 'romance', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'humor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'much', 'more', ""'ll"", 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much.Norton', 'superb', 'lovelorn', 'character', 'progressively', 'sicker', 'story', 'unfolds', 'energy', 'reclaim', 'love', 'life', 'Biel', 'wonderful', 'job', 'even', 'accent', ""n't"", 'most', 'believable', 'role', 'royalty', 'very', 'well', 'Giamatti', 'perfect', 'Uhl', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'matter', 'hand', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'should', 'root', 'pray', 'just', 'desserts', 'Sewell', 'delivers', 'opinion', 'top', 'performance', 'story', 'arrogant', 'vengeful', 'baldfaced', 'liar', 'boot', 'actions', 'keep', 'story', 'moving', 'along', 'acceptable', 'pace.Overall', 'film', 'well', 'deserving', 'four-and-one-half', 'stars', 'great', 'flick', 'forbidden', 'love', 'deceit', 'violence', 'little', 'bit', 'magic', 'one', 'definite', 'keeper', 'give', 'must', 'buy', 'seal', 'approval']",N/A

He does a great job and frankly the only time the movie comes alive is when he's on screen. Second, the character actor playing Crown Prince Leopold's valet. He expresses anguish, shame and shock using nothing but body language and his eyes. Very good. The guy playing Leopold was fairly interesting and can look back on his role here without shame.Now, what's wrong? Edward Norton, sure he's a great actor but not in this flick. He spends the entire movie looking like he's got hemorrhoids. The flat voice, the stiff ooh don't make the itch and burn start up again walk, the dead eyed stare--- none of that looked like a man in love and there were times when I was laughing at him. Plus his accent weaved in and out worse than Kevin Costner as Robin Hood. Sometimes he sounded like an Austrian and sometimes he sounded like a dude from Idaho.Jessica Biel is a pretty girl and she really has nothing to do but look lovely in her role but she can't even do that. She seemed like an android. She walked and talked but was completely souless. Her version of Sophie wouldn't turn most men's heads for more than a night, the audience is asked to believe that this bland, stilted creature somehow held a man's heart for 15 years.

A unique magic/mystery/love story that is wonderfully written, perfectly cast and excellently directed and acted. The blu-ray is a solid improvement over the dvd, however, because the film was shot in a bit of a soft-focus way, it may not come across as razor-sharp as the newer blu-rays. Still, its well worth an upgrade from the dvd for such an excellent movie.My only criticism is with the rest of the blu-ray treatment. While the picture and sound are excellent, everything else is an embarrassment. There is no main menu, no chapter selection or bookmarks, and no special features on the blu-ray disc. Just a garish intro page telling the viewer that they can access the specifications by pressing the top-menu button. That gives you access only to the audio setting. And there are no subtitle options either. Madness! Subtitles actually would help occasionally on this particular film as sometimes the actors are speaking quietly and are difficult to hear, and what they are saying is important to the mystery of the film.This set includes the original dvd disc which DOES have a main menu with all the expected options, so the buyer gets a bizarre combination of a blu-ray disc with nothing but a hi-def picture, and a vastly inferior standard-def disc that treats the film with at least a little of the respect that it richly deserves.In the end, I'm glad to finally have a hi-def version of The Illusionist, but I'm baffled and frustrated that Fox treated it with such contempt.",2,"wonderful film, flawed blu-ray",1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,1532,"['Illusionist', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'unique', 'magic/mystery/love', 'story', 'wonderfully', 'written', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'excellently', 'directed', 'acted', 'blu-ray', 'solid', 'improvement', 'dvd', 'however', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'bit', 'soft-focus', 'way', 'may', 'not', 'come', 'as', 'razor-sharp', 'newer', 'blu-rays', 'Still', 'well', 'upgrade', 'dvd', 'such', 'excellent', 'movie.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'rest', 'blu-ray', 'treatment', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'excellent', 'everything', 'else', 'embarrassment', 'main', 'menu', 'chapter', 'selection', 'bookmarks', 'special', 'features', 'blu-ray', 'disc', 'Just', 'garish', 'intro', 'page', 'telling', 'viewer', 'can', 'access', 'specifications', 'pressing', 'top-menu', 'button', 'access', 'only', 'audio', 'setting', 'are', 'subtitle', 'options', 'Madness', 'Subtitles', 'actually', 'would', 'help', 'occasionally', 'particular', 'film', 'sometimes', 'actors', 'are', 'speaking', 'quietly', 'are', 'difficult', 'hear', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'important', 'mystery', 'film.This', 'set', 'original', 'dvd', 'disc', 'DOES', 'have', 'main', 'menu', 'expected', 'options', 'buyer', 'bizarre', 'combination', 'blu-ray', 'disc', 'nothing', 'hi-def', 'picture', 'vastly', 'inferior', 'standard-def', 'disc', 'film', 'least', 'little', 'respect', 'end', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'have', 'hi-def', 'version', 'Illusionist', ""'m"", 'baffled', 'frustrated', 'Fox', 'treated', 'such', 'contempt']",N/A

Hitler might be said to have perfected Hanussen's art, and later repaid his teacher by having Hanussen killed.THE ILLUSIONIST, however, does not touch on these facts. Instead, it is a heavily stylized, darkly atmospheric, and deeply convincing period film which recounts how Eisenheim and Sophie manage to carry on a love affair while discrediting Sophie's fiance, the Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary. (The historical Crown Prince, Rudolf, committed suicide after murdering his mistress.)Edward Norton (and forgive me, but I can never think of him without thinking of Art Carney) plays Eisenheim with an understated intensity, as a man convinced of his own rightness who manages, despite this, to never misstep into arrogance. Jessica Biel is beautiful, intelligent, noble, and facile, as Sophie. Both give excellent performances, but the stellar performance of this film belongs to Paul Giamatti, as Police Inspector Uhl, the agent of the Crown Prince, who becomes half-conspirator and half-pawn in the convoluted plan hatched by Eisenheim and Sophie to steal away from Vienna together.THIS FILM IS VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5,"""Everything you've seen here is an illusion.""",1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,1720,"['ILLUSIONIST', 'heavily', 'fictionalized', 'tale', 'love', 'affair', 'Eisenheim', 'Illusionist', 'Princess', 'Sophie', 'Austro-Hungarian', 'Empire', 'taking', 'place', 'years', 'just', 'prior', 'First', 'World', 'War.It', 'not', 'widely', 'known', 'historical', 'Eisenheim', 'was', 'fact', 'Jewish', 'name', 'was', 'Erik', 'Jan', 'Hanussen', 'born', 'Hermann', 'Steinschneider', 'being', 'tremendously', 'sought-after', 'spiritualist', 'entertainer', '1900s', 'Vienna', 'was', 'later', 'friend', 'mentor', 'young', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'whom', 'Hanussen', 'taught', 'many', 'techniques', 'deceiving', 'manipulating', 'audiences', 'Hitler', 'might', 'be', 'said', 'have', 'perfected', 'Hanussen', 'art', 'later', 'repaid', 'teacher', 'having', 'Hanussen', 'killed.THE', 'ILLUSIONIST', 'however', 'not', 'touch', 'facts', 'Instead', 'heavily', 'stylized', 'darkly', 'atmospheric', 'deeply', 'convincing', 'period', 'film', 'how', 'Eisenheim', 'Sophie', 'manage', 'carry', 'love', 'affair', 'discrediting', 'Sophie', 'fiance', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Austria-Hungary', 'historical', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Rudolf', 'committed', 'suicide', 'murdering', 'mistress', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'forgive', 'can', 'never', 'think', 'thinking', 'Art', 'Carney', 'Eisenheim', 'understated', 'intensity', 'man', 'convinced', 'own', 'rightness', 'who', 'never', 'misstep', 'arrogance', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'noble', 'facile', 'Sophie', 'Both', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'stellar', 'performance', 'film', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Police', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'agent', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'who', 'half-conspirator', 'half-pawn', 'convoluted', 'plan', 'hatched', 'Eisenheim', 'Sophie', 'steal', 'away', 'Vienna', 'together.THIS', 'FILM', 'IS', 'VERY', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

1032380,AR3HV5WH2I4B2,B000K7VHPU,"Kristopher KR ""Um, yeah.""","[1, 1]","The Illusionist is a film about a grand magician in olden Vienna.  He is unlike most magic performers due to the fact his tricks involve very little sleight of hand or card tricks.  Although it is not fleshed out completely, there may be something slightly darker about the ability Eisenhem the Illusionist (Edward Norton) posesses.As a young boy, a legend is told how he came across an ancient sorcerer whom taught him one trick, then making him aware magic comes from nowhere but within himself.  Eisenheim falls for an aristocratic young lady (Jessica Biel) whom he is forbidden from seeing due in part to his ""black magic"" and her social status.  He breaks no laws, however authority hassels him enough.While attempting to escape with his true love, he is caught once more, then given an ultimatum.  Either he can be arrested, or he can disappear from the life of the woman.Growing up, he turns his act into a moneymaker.  He astounds audiences across the world with magic tricks seemingly impossible.  Even to an investegator (Paul Giamatti) who works for the Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell), attempting to detect exactly how Eisenheim performs the tricks.  Some may say it is a form of wizardry, or black magic.  From the legal point of view, Giamatti's character is calling it fraud.As it turns out, Eisenheims lost love is now the Crown Princes found love and fiance.  When this is discovered, Eisenheim will stop at nothing to have her in his arms again.  The Crown Prince is devilishly evil, wanting to selfishly overthrow the Emperor early so he may make his way to the throne.It is Commander Uhl's (Giamatti) duty to prove to the Crown Prince that Eisenheim is in fact a fraud and ruin his good name.  Thereby boosting the ego of the Crown Prince and running Eisenheim out of town.Soon a murder occurs that points to only two suspects, and the rightful murderer must be brought to justice.Some may say this film has a confusing plot.  It is a bit challenging to write a summary about such a film without giving away too much.The movie itself is beautifully acted.  With a cast which includes to Oscar nominees (Giamatti and Norton) not to mention the beauty of Jessica Biel and the cunning of Rufus Sewell, the acting is nothing short of superb.The mystery of the film is found among many layers.  First the entire plot of how the murder takes place, and who the culprit is.  It may be simple on the surface, but onions and mysteries have muliple layers.  Next the tricks performed in the film.  Of course, it's special effects, but the questions still remain how and if they could be done by someone who does a bit more than distract the audience with mirrors and gestures.The cinematography of the film is unique to say the least.  Throughout the movie, it almost feels as if the audience is watching an old silent film.  The corners of the screen are blackend as if we are watching the film through an old tube.Overall I would say the film has class, style and a wonderful plot.  Perhaps it could move a bit faster, pacewise, but it's still a good time to be had.Watch and enjoy!",4,"It's not an Illusion, this is a good film",1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,3090,"['Illusionist', 'film', 'grand', 'magician', 'olden', 'Vienna', 'most', 'magic', 'performers', 'due', 'fact', 'tricks', 'involve', 'very', 'little', 'sleight', 'hand', 'card', 'tricks', 'not', 'fleshed', 'out', 'completely', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'slightly', 'ability', 'Eisenhem', 'Illusionist', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'posesses.As', 'young', 'boy', 'legend', 'told', 'how', 'came', 'ancient', 'sorcerer', 'whom', 'taught', 'one', 'trick', 'then', 'making', 'aware', 'magic', 'nowhere', 'Eisenheim', 'aristocratic', 'young', 'lady', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'whom', 'forbidden', 'seeing', 'due', 'part', 'black', 'magic', 'social', 'status', 'laws', 'however', 'authority', 'hassels', 'enough.While', 'attempting', 'escape', 'true', 'love', 'caught', 'once', 'more', 'then', 'given', 'ultimatum', 'can', 'be', 'arrested', 'can', 'disappear', 'life', 'woman.Growing', 'up', 'act', 'moneymaker', 'audiences', 'world', 'magic', 'tricks', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'Even', 'investegator', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'who', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'attempting', 'detect', 'exactly', 'how', 'Eisenheim', 'tricks', 'may', 'say', 'form', 'wizardry', 'black', 'magic', 'legal', 'point', 'view', 'Giamatti', 'character', 'calling', 'out', 'lost', 'love', 'now', 'Crown', 'Princes', 'found', 'love', 'fiance', 'When', 'discovered', 'Eisenheim', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'have', 'arms', 'again', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'devilishly', 'evil', 'wanting', 'selfishly', 'overthrow', 'Emperor', 'early', 'so', 'may', 'make', 'way', 'throne.It', 'Commander', 'Uhl', 'Giamatti', 'duty', 'prove', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Eisenheim', 'fact', 'fraud', 'ruin', 'good', 'name', 'Thereby', 'boosting', 'ego', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'running', 'Eisenheim', 'town.Soon', 'murder', 'points', 'only', 'two', 'suspects', 'rightful', 'murderer', 'must', 'be', 'brought', 'justice.Some', 'may', 'say', 'film', 'confusing', 'plot', 'bit', 'challenging', 'write', 'summary', 'film', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much.The', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'cast', 'Oscar', 'nominees', 'Giamatti', 'Norton', 'not', 'mention', 'beauty', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'cunning', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'acting', 'nothing', 'short', 'superb.The', 'mystery', 'film', 'found', 'many', 'layers', 'First', 'entire', 'plot', 'how', 'murder', 'place', 'who', 'culprit', 'may', 'be', 'simple', 'surface', 'onions', 'mysteries', 'have', 'muliple', 'layers', 'tricks', 'performed', 'film', 'course', 'special', 'effects', 'questions', 'still', 'remain', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'someone', 'who', 'bit', 'more', 'distract', 'audience', 'mirrors', 'gestures.The', 'cinematography', 'film', 'unique', 'say', 'least', 'movie', 'almost', 'audience', 'watching', 'old', 'silent', 'film', 'corners', 'screen', 'are', 'blackend', 'are', 'watching', 'film', 'old', 'tube.Overall', 'would', 'say', 'film', 'class', 'style', 'wonderful', 'plot', 'Perhaps', 'could', 'move', 'bit', 'faster', 'pacewise', 'still', 'good', 'time', 'be', 'had.Watch', 'enjoy']",N/A

That movie seemed to have everything that this movie didn't.  Not to say that this isn't a good movie because it is.  All I'm saying is that I guessed much of the plot for The Illusionist while The Prestige kept me off guard and amazed.  Both movies are good and should be rented or bought(PRESTIGE!) ahem.  Sorry.  I just felt like comparing the two movies, but since this is a review for The Illusionist, I'll start the review.Most of the actors/actresses are great.  Paul Giamatti is one of my favorites and once again gives a great performance.  Edward Norton also gives a fabulous performance along with Rufus Sewell.  But then there is Biel.  Ick.  .  Ugh.  Wince.  I am of course refering to her performance.  She looks great, but she just was in over her head in this one.  I think my local movie critic(Chris Hewitt, St. Paul, Pioneer Press) put it best.  He said, ""Paul Giamatti and Edward Norton deliver great performances, the only problem is that Jessica Biel occasionaly wanders in.""  Thats how it is.  A+ for Paul and Norton.  A failing grade for Biel.The Direction was very good, I really disliked the ending which lacked magic.  It wasn't a huge surprise and they never told us how the final trick was done.  I was left going ""Oh.  Thats it?""  I did like the dark tones and colors and grainyish quality.Overall this was a movie that had some mild disappointment and some mild surprise.  Not a great movie, but not bad by any means.  I suggest you rent this then BUY The Prestige.  Of course you might like this more, but my point is at least see both of this films.

Her feigned English accent was awful and she just felt wrong for this role. The good parts were the beautiful cinematography, the great special effects, and the twist at the end which, while predictable, was intriging none the less. The movie had a very interesting plot.

I can't imagine why so many people can't help but constantly compare this movie to ""The Prestige"" when with the exception of the magical theme they are nothing alike. First of all, the illusions that are done in this film are absolutely amazing, but yet they reveal nothing to the audience about how they were done. The magic tricks in ""The Prestige"" pale in comparison to the illusions you saw in this film. Secondly, the premises are totally different. Thirdly, the ending of ""The Prestige"" is still somewhat of an enigma to me. I guess it's just a matter of the way a person interprets things. I really like movies with endings that surprise you, or make you think about what you just saw, and this ending doesn't disappoint. For me, I think the ending (which I won't reveal) and the illusions are really what sold this film.

Such a concern is at the heart of ""The Illusionist,"" a 2006 film from writer-director Neil Burger (""Interview with an Assassin""), adapted from a short story by Steven Millhauser that draws some inspiration from the infamous Mayerling Incident but clearly goes its own way.We begin in Vienna at the previous turn of the century and a performance by Eisenheim the Illusionist (Edward Norton), at which the title character is arrested by Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti).  Apparently Eisenheim is doing something he should not be doing, and all that is revealed throughout the rest of the film until we come full circle to the opening scene and understand its import.  We then learn that once upon a time the young Eisenheim had been friends with the young Sophie, but now he has grown up to be a master illusionist and the hottest thing in Vienna while she is the Duchess Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel), the presumptive fiancee for Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), thereby setting the stage for a deadly love triangle.The Crown Prince is a paragon of arrogant rationality mixed with an indulgent temper who takes Eisenheim's illusions as an intellectual challenge but stops short of demanding Eisenheim tell how he does it.  Uhl is something of an amateur magician regarding card tricks and slight of hand, so he is also curious about the method behind the magic, but respects the professionalism of the performances, at least until the Crown Prince orders him to do otherwise as Sophie appears to be on the verge of choosing the Illusionist over the Crown Prince, a decision that will have deadly consequences.  Eisenheim's illusions are fascinating, but it is the human drama that matters more here.""The Illusionist"" has the virtue of a talented cast in what is essentially an art house film (I am somewhat surprised that they all signed on for such a small and intimate period piece, although Biel clearly is trying to show she can act and following the leads of Norton and Giamatti in proving less is more).  This becomes crucial because I suspect most viewers will know the trick that is being played even if they are not sure how it is being pulled off, so Burger's film gets credit for making us more than willing to go along for the ride.  I have a preference for films that are able to fool me from start to finish, but I ended up rounding up on ""The Illusionist"" because I applaud the film's final scene and the joy of one character in figuring out how it was done.",5,"""The Illusionist"" fools the right people at the right time",1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,2907,"['Do', 'enjoy', 'illusion', 'less', 'when', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'inevitable', 'question', 'when', 'watching', 'magic', 'trick', 'being', 'performed', 'How', 'did', 'do', 'time', 'time', 'are', 'e.g.', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'who', 'will', 'reveal', 'secret', 'trick', 'have', 'usually', 'found', 'as', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'learning', 'how', 'pulled', 'off', 'watching', 'trick', 'being', 'performed', 'first', 'place', 'concern', 'heart', 'Illusionist', '2006', 'film', 'writer-director', 'Neil', 'Burger', 'Interview', 'Assassin', 'adapted', 'short', 'story', 'Steven', 'Millhauser', 'inspiration', 'infamous', 'Mayerling', 'Incident', 'clearly', 'own', 'way.We', 'begin', 'Vienna', 'previous', 'turn', 'century', 'performance', 'Eisenheim', 'Illusionist', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'title', 'character', 'arrested', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Apparently', 'Eisenheim', 'doing', 'something', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'doing', 'revealed', 'rest', 'film', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'opening', 'scene', 'understand', 'import', 'then', 'learn', 'once', 'time', 'young', 'Eisenheim', 'had', 'been', 'friends', 'young', 'Sophie', 'now', 'grown', 'up', 'be', 'master', 'illusionist', 'hottest', 'thing', 'Vienna', 'Duchess', 'Sophie', 'von', 'Teschen', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'presumptive', 'fiancee', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'thereby', 'setting', 'stage', 'deadly', 'love', 'triangle.The', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'paragon', 'arrogant', 'rationality', 'mixed', 'indulgent', 'temper', 'who', 'Eisenheim', 'illusions', 'intellectual', 'challenge', 'short', 'demanding', 'Eisenheim', 'tell', 'how', 'Uhl', 'something', 'amateur', 'magician', 'regarding', 'card', 'tricks', 'slight', 'hand', 'also', 'curious', 'method', 'magic', 'professionalism', 'performances', 'least', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'orders', 'do', 'otherwise', 'Sophie', 'be', 'verge', 'choosing', 'Illusionist', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'decision', 'will', 'have', 'deadly', 'consequences', 'Eisenheim', 'illusions', 'are', 'fascinating', 'human', 'drama', 'more', 'here', 'Illusionist', 'virtue', 'talented', 'cast', 'what', 'essentially', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'am', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'signed', 'such', 'small', 'intimate', 'period', 'piece', 'Biel', 'clearly', 'trying', 'show', 'can', 'act', 'following', 'leads', 'Norton', 'Giamatti', 'proving', 'less', 'more', 'crucial', 'suspect', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'know', 'trick', 'being', 'played', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'being', 'pulled', 'off', 'so', 'Burger', 'film', 'credit', 'making', 'more', 'willing', 'go', 'along', 'ride', 'have', 'preference', 'films', 'are', 'able', 'fool', 'start', 'finish', 'ended', 'up', 'rounding', 'up', 'Illusionist', 'applaud', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'joy', 'one', 'character', 'figuring', 'out', 'how', 'was', 'done']",N/A

This film is an adaptation of a story by Pulitzer Prize winning author Steven Millhauser.  The excellent cinematography of Dick Pope was nominated for an Oscar, a similar award which he won from the San Diego Film Critics.  Philip Glass' score was recognized with an award by the New York Film Critics Online.  I enjoyed the acting in the film.  Edward Norton was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ""Primal Fear"" in 1996 and as Best Actor in 1998 for ""American History X.""  His film ""The Painted Veil"" was touching and excellent.  As Eisenheim, Norton's performance is highly controlled, internal.  We are unable to tell if anything is reaching him, but see his desire for Sophie.  In the DVD extras, it took me a moment to recognize him without his beard.  Jessica Biel has been in two very interesting film projects,LondonandUlee's Gold.  In the DVD extras, she says that Sophie von Teschen was a part she actively sought & was delighted to play.  Within the same week, I had purchased and watched the DVDAmazing Grace.  Rufus Sewell plays the slave reformer Clarkson with flowing long hair and totes a bag full of manacles for most of the film.  When I looked at the box for this film, I was so surprised to see the same actor.  As Crown Prince Leopold, Sewell delivers a tightly knit performance, threatening to be lethal to any around him.  The moment when he strikes Sophie almost made my blood chill.  Sophie looks at him with cold eyes and merely says, ""Goodbye.""  It's an excellent moment.  Paul Giamatti won a Best Actor award from the Toronto Film Critics for his breakout role inSideways (Widescreen Edition).  He was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ""Cinderella Man"" in 2005, and won a similar award that year from Screen Actors Guild.  As Chief Inspector Uhl, he will not let go of this case & is committed to following the truth, no matter where it leads.  I found the story of this film to be riveting.  It spiraled into the unknown at every turn for me.  From the almost supernatural illusions of the ""ghosts"" to the orange tree that mysteriously grows, I found each new performance of Eisenheim to be an adventure.  Neil Burger kept the pace moving swiftly.  The romantic childhood relationship that seems to bloom into destined lovers captured my imagination.

But then again, I should have known that any film with Ed Norton and Paul Giamatti would be something special.  I've been following the careers of both of these actors, and they have always chosen excellent roles.  I had never seen Jessica Biel before, but she also showed up as an imposing film presence.The film is set in Vienna around the turn of the 20th century.  There's a dreamy quality about it, and the gaslight and candlelight feels absolutely authentic.  Edward Norton and Jessica Biel are childhood sweethearts.  But, alas, she is royalty and he is the son of a carpenter.  They are forced to separate and he travels the world for 15 years.  When he comes back to Vienna, he is ""The Illusionist"" and we meet him onstage as he impresses his audience.  His fame grows.  And soon the crown prince wants to see his show.  Jessica Biel is now the crown prince's fianc&eacute;.  But as soon as she participates in a trick with the illusionist, she recognizes him from her childhood.  The scene is now set for romance and intrigue.Paul Giamatti is cast as a police inspector.  He is the glue that holds the story together as we view the action through his eyes.  He is perfectly cast in the role.  He too, is lowly born, but the wicked crown prince, who is likely to fly into a rage when challenged, holds the key to elevating him to a much high position in court.  But first, the police inspector must prove his worth.A murder investigation is central to the plot.  And we all know that The Illusionist knows more than he is letting on.  When we look into Edward Norton's eyes, we know he is hiding something.  But we can't tell what it is.  He is the master of every scene.  I couldn't take my eyes off him.  Many of his scenes are onstage.  And we know they are illusions.  But how does he do it?Wisely, the filmmakers kept away from computer graphics.  All the illusions seem real.  And we, the film audience, experience them the same way an audience in 1900 would have.  I was absolutely caught up in the plot and the mystery.  I knew there was a secret and my mind was constantly trying to figure it all out.And then, in the very last minute of the film, it all becomes clear.  Fascinating.  Well done.

The Illusionist does not keep your fists gripped and your back leaned forward towards the TV the entire movie like The Prestige will have you doing.  There isn't that much to follow closely, at least, not nearly as much as in The Prestige.  Furthermore, the ending is cliched whereas in The Prestige you will be shocked until the very last scene.Lastly, and to me when it comes to purchasing DVDs, this is the most important:  The Re-Watching value of The Prestige is much higher.  You need to watch it again and again to understand it.  Watching it with friends and family who haven't seen it is even more fun, because you're wondering if they can figure it out or not.

As I was waiting to go in, a man coming out of an earlier showing said this was the best movie he had seen all year.  As we had driven 40 miles to see The Illusionist, I sincerely hoped he was correct.  He was, to my delight.This was a superb little movie.  Edward Norton was absolutely riveting, Paul Giamatti cements his place as one of America's premiere actors, and Jessica Biel pulled off what could have been for her too much of a stretch.  The characters were that important must for a movie--they were all likable.  You wanted to see The Illusionist pull it off.  This movie had twists and turns that caught me unawaresThe scenery was breathtaking and it was wonderful to see a period piece.  It was so refreshing to see a different setting and something different at the movies.The true test of a movie is whether I want it to end ( and end quickly) and will I be able to watch it again.  The answers are NO and Yes.  It could have gone on another 45 minutes and I can't wait for the DVD.I found The Illusionist after I had seen the trailer for The Prestige.  I sort of got the movies mixed up.  But, having seen The Illusionist first and The Prestige last night, I can say there is no comparison.  The Prestige was too long, too convuluted, and had characters I had no sympathy for.Save your money for The Illusionist DVD and skip The Prestige.  IMO, there is no comparison.

Edward Norton delivers a stunning portrayal of Eisenheim, a magician who has captured the attention of audiences throughout Europe with his masterful illusions and sleight-of-hand.  Jessica Biel co-stars as Sophie, and Paul Giamatti is an absolute delight as Inspector Uhl.The movie is narrated by Inspector Uhl throughout, and that device -- so much like Sherlock Holmes's Watson -- is at once deceptively trustworthy and likeable.  Everything we see and hear is filtered through Uhl's perceptions and own involvement with the principal cast.The movie opens up with Eisenheim performing one of his nightly routines, and Norton is at his seductive best in this opening.  His voice, his mannerisms, and his look drew me in and put me in one of those seats.  I was astonished to watch what he did.But the story only began there.  It quickly segued back into Eisenheim's childhood, and his adolescent romance with Sophie.  According to Uhl's account, Eisenheim was the son of a carpenter who barely made ends meet.  Then one day the boy met a magician who showed him some magic tricks.  Seized by what he had seen, the boy taught himself magic, created tricks, and learned from anyone who knew anything.During that time, he met Sophie.  The children played together, but Sophie's parents found out and took her away, telling the boy he wasn't good enough for her.Now, in Vienna, Eisenheim and Sophie's paths have crossed again, and they find that the love they had for each other has never wavered.  I have to admit, I'm a sucker for a love story, and this one was so well done it just takes the breath way.Part of what makes THE ILLUSIONIST work so well is the period piece costumes and sets.  Even the camera work, with its sepia tones and use of what looks like natural lighting, is beautiful.  The movie made me feel I was back during those times, watching the story unfold.Of course, for a love story like this to work properly, there has to be a villain.  Rufus Sewell play Crown Prince Leopold, the man who desires Sophie's hand in marriage.  Leopold also has a reputation for abusing -- and perhaps murdering -- the women in his life.To tell anything further would be a crime.

And this might not be a bad thing had the movie not taken itself so dreadfully serious. In fact to be honest, ""The Illusionist"" is the worst kind of film making: dull, sickeningly pretentious, overstuffed visually and pompously acted. Even the excellent Edward Norton, who can usually do no wrong, is caught up in all the declamatory, melodrama style of acting on exhibit here. To top it all off Phillip Glass borrows many themes from his irritating score of ""The Hours"" which underscores and sometimes over scores what little action there is in this static bore of a film.Despite all of this, the actual bare bones story is unusual and interesting having to do with reality/illusion, love/desire, sexual attraction and the walls between social classes that existed in turn of the century Vienna. Director Neil Burger's take on all this is simply just wrong. In a nutshell: if your story is tricky, complicated, mysterious, etc...you had better make all the window dressing, including the acting, very straightforward and pure devoid of old-style stage gesticulations and overly dramatic musical crescendos. Burger, of course does just the opposite and what we have then is once again: an excellent cast miss-used, an interesting story miss-directed...another case of great aspirations turned into a big, over-fed, corpulent sow of a movie.",2,Play to the Rafters!!,1157846400,"09 10, 2006",2006,1468,"['Illusionist', 'luxuriously', 'filmed', 'scored', 'opulent', 'style', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'recent', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'had', 'movie', 'not', 'taken', 'so', 'dreadfully', 'serious', 'fact', 'be', 'honest', 'Illusionist', 'worst', 'kind', 'film', 'making', 'dull', 'sickeningly', 'pretentious', 'overstuffed', 'visually', 'pompously', 'acted', 'Even', 'excellent', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'who', 'can', 'usually', 'do', 'wrong', 'caught', 'up', 'declamatory', 'melodrama', 'style', 'acting', 'exhibit', 'here', 'top', 'off', 'Phillip', 'Glass', 'many', 'themes', 'irritating', 'score', 'Hours', 'sometimes', 'scores', 'what', 'little', 'action', 'static', 'bore', 'film.Despite', 'actual', 'bare', 'bones', 'story', 'unusual', 'interesting', 'having', 'do', 'reality/illusion', 'love/desire', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'walls', 'social', 'classes', 'existed', 'turn', 'century', 'Vienna', 'Director', 'Neil', 'Burger', 'take', 'simply', 'just', 'wrong', 'nutshell', 'story', 'tricky', 'complicated', 'mysterious', 'etc', 'had', 'better', 'make', 'window', 'dressing', 'including', 'acting', 'very', 'straightforward', 'pure', 'devoid', 'old-style', 'stage', 'gesticulations', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'musical', 'crescendos', 'Burger', 'course', 'just', 'opposite', 'what', 'have', 'then', 'once', 'again', 'excellent', 'cast', 'miss-used', 'interesting', 'story', 'miss-directed', 'case', 'great', 'aspirations', 'turned', 'big', 'over-fed', 'corpulent', 'sow', 'movie']",N/A

The rest of the movie is a ""flashback"" leading up to that scene.  We find Norton's character as a boy coming across a mysterious man by a tree.  You don't know if Norton actually met him or imagined him as the guy disappears.  Norton has an interest in magic and his character meets a well to do girl who he becomes friends with.  The two sneak off together so Norton can show her his magic tricks and generally hang out (like friends in a clubhouse).The girl's parents infuriated that she has taken up with a ""commoner"" come after her.  When they are about to get caught the girl begs Norton to make them disappear.  Norton tries but fails and the two are caught.  The girl is brought home forbidden to ever see Norton again.Years later Norton has become a famous magician with the name of Meisenheim.  He is watched by a police chief who is somewhat of an amateur magician himself.  He is fascinated by Meisenheim and begs to be shown one of Meisenheim's tricks where he makes an orange tree seemingly grow out of a flowerpot instantaneously.At one of Meisenheim's shows he calls a volunteer to assist him from the audience and it is the fianc&eacute;e (Jessica Biels) of the heir to the Austrian throne.  Meisenheim realizes it is his childhood friend because she is wearing the same magic locket that he gave her when they were kids.  He becomes infatuated with her and starts to pursue her.Meanwhile the police chief, loyal to the Austrian heir is keeping a close watch on Meisenheim, suspecting something may be afoot between him and Biels.  The police chief has his own agenda as he was born a peasant and believes through faithful support of the heir, he can rise to Mayor when then heir becomes the next emperor.The rest of the movie becomes a game of cat and mouse between Meisenheim, the police chief and the heir and Biels and you are not sure if what you suspect to be is true or an ""Illusion"" as the title of the movie suggests.  Not really a spoiler but the real facts are only revealed in the last sequence, which seems to happen so fast that if you watched it on DVD you would need to rewind several times.I thought that the acting of the police chief and the heir were superb but Norton and Biel's performances were just okay.  The movie seemed to drag in parts and even when you see the explanation at the end, some of the scenes seemed to not be feasible based on the explanation given.

Eisenheim the Illusionist (Edward Norton) and Duchess  Sophie Van Teschan (Jessica Biel) were childhood friends until her family sensed that her royal blood was getting too close to a common cabinet makers son forcibly separated the two, presumably never to meet again. Fifteen years later Duchess Sophie has become engaged to  Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), who is more becoming of her royal bloodlines than Eisenheim would have been. Eisenheim is a successful illusionist bringing wonder and mystery to the masses. One night at a show, Leopold cowardly volunteers Sophie as a volunteer in one of Eisenheim's illusions. Eisenheim recognizes her quickly and their friendship is rekindled having never really drowned fifteen years before, much to the dismay and nervousness of Leopold.As Sophie and Eisenheim grow closer together, Leopold becomes concerned because he needs Sophie's hand in marriage because her family is the ruling family of Hungary, whose backing he needs to overthrow his father and seize power for himself. Therefore, he sends Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to investigate the activities of Eisenheim and Sophie. Having heard tales of the Crown Prince's murderous temper and desperate to be with his love, Eisenheim cooks up his greatest illusion yet. First Sophie tells Leopold that she's leaving him, thusly ending any chance Leopold has of carry out his power ladden, ruthful, ambitions. Angered by the news, a drunken Leopold takes vengeance on Sophie fatally stabbing her and leaving Eisenheim to grieve over the duchess body.As Uhl conducts an investigation that seems to point everywhere but at the Prince because Uhl stands to be head of police in a Leopold Monarchy if he takes power, lucrative position for the son of a butcher, Prince Leopold begins to loose control having had his ambitions ruined by a common Illusionist and takes heavy to the drink and begins to drift slowly out of his mind, driven to madness by Eisenheim's last trick and carefully placed clues which has the ghost of Sophie appear out of thin air and revel Prince Leopold as the man who killed her. With his career in ruins and his pride tragically fallen, Leopold takes his own life as Uhl begins to unravel the mysteries of his Eisenheim's greatest illusion, finding the pride and gumption to stand up to a desperate Leopold in his last grasps of power.Great acting by Giamatti, Norton, and Jessica Biel surprised me in this one as well.

1032423,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000K7VHPU,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 3]","The Illusionist is a tale of performer vs. nobleman in eighteenth century Vienna.  The magician performs on stage, the nobleman hosts social events; both are platforms for waging a war of ideas.At its heart, the Illusionist is about two men fighting for a woman's heart.  Eisenheim (Edward Norton, intense as ever), is a long lost childhood friend of the Duchess Sophie (Jessica Beil, looking positively radiant).  As the mere son of a carpenter, he is not of the appropriate social status to romance the young Duchess, and thus the two are separated on pain of imprisonment.  Eisenheim leaves for the Orient; when he returns, he has a few tricks up his sleeve.The Crown Prince Leopold (played by Rufus Sewell with bristling rage) is a brutish man with high ambitions.  He plans to supplant his father and take the throne as Emperor of Austria.  Sophie represents a political alliance of convenience, and her pending marriage to Leopold is a demand, not a request.  As Sophie states, ""He will never leave us alone until we are both dead."" This gives Eisenheim an idea.Investigating the case is Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), embodying the everyman who's basically a decent soul, but caged by his career.  Living on the periphery of Leopold's shadow, Uhl has little choice but to follow the Prince's doomed bid for power.Thus the stage is set for a battle of hearts and minds, prince vs. performer, as both use their respective soapboxes to espouse their ideologies.  Upon the murder of the Duchess, Eisenheim shifts his magic acts from prestidigitation to spiritualism, summoning spirits of the dead before a live audience.  The amazing spirits he summons are so convincing that Eisenheim practically creates a new religion.The Illusionist is filmed in sepia tones, befitting a movie set in the 18th-century.  Cut scenes squint in and out of focus like old silent movies.  Phillip Glass' usually repetitive music is appropriate as a backdrop to Vienna, neither intrusive or cloying.By far the most impressive of The Illusionist's visual effects are the magic tricks themselves.  Through judicious use of computer graphics, Eisenheim causes an orange tree to grow before our eyes, butterflies to carry handkerchiefs over the audience's head, and ghosts to walk right through people.  This is most assuredly not what the magic tricks would have really looked like in the 18th century, but director Neil Burger has a different goal: he wants us to experience Eisenheim's magic as if WE were the audience, so the special effects are ratcheted up to fool modern audiences.  In essence, it's an illusion about an illusion. It works perfectly.The actors really earn their keep.  Norton is amazing as Eisenheim, alternately distant and focused, passionate and reserved.  He suffers with painful, palpable longing for the Duchess.  Biel, relegated to elfin, punk roles in the past, comes into her own here as a desperate, trapped woman resigned to her gilded cage.  And then there's Giamatti, who grumbles, glares, and huffs like every good inspector should.  He also adds a much-needed dose of humor.I'm not exactly sure where the film was being advertised, but it must have been aiming at a very specific demographic. When my wife and I went to see The Illusionist, we were surprised that the average age group of our fellow moviegoers was 60 and up.  At one point, the inspector speaks an expletive that was obviously edited out; this movie has been sanitized for grandmas everywhere. Fortunately, the change isn't detrimental to the movie.The conclusion isn't much of a surprise for attentive moviegoers.  In fact, I would have taken points off for Burger hitting us over the head with a hammer to explain what happened...except that the elderly couple behind us had difficulty distinguishing Norton from Giamatti.  They asked everyone in earshot what the big twist was. They kept asking as we left the theater...and even the restroom.Overall, The Illusionist is a tight film of big ideas wrapped in the Victorian veneer of the old world.

1032428,A1FG91CM8221X1,B000K7VHPU,Miles D. Moore,"[3, 3]","Neil Burger's ""The Illusionist"" is an elegantly civilized entertainment that just barely misses the transition into a masterpiece. But since elegantly civilized entertainments are in short supply these days, I won't be too hard on it. With the magnificent help of cinematographer Dick Pope and production designer Ondrej Nekvasil, Burger crafts a somber, rich and romantic mystery based on Steven Millhauser's short story about Eisenheim, a brilliant magician in 1900 Vienna, who tries to reclaim Sophie, his aristocratic, long-lost love. However, the treacherous Crown Prince Leopold wants Sophie as his consort, and orders the assiduous Chief Inspector Uhl to rid the empire of Eisenheim, by any means possible. What follows is a compelling cat-and-mouse game that touches on the eternal mysteries of existence, and at its best leaves the audience truly breathless with its artful legerdemain. Unfortunately, the story's denouement, while clever, is more prosaic than what Burger led us to expect. But the film's sheer craftsmanship makes it more than worth seeing, particularly since the stars are Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, two actors who improve any film simply by virtue of appearing in it. Norton, an actor whose eyes reflect unplumbed depths in every role he plays, is the perfect choice for Eisenheim. Giamatti, famous for playing neurotics and boy-men, here plays a character of cool, cerebral intelligence, and does so with commanding presence and voice. Their face-offs are the best part of the movie, and they play them like fencing masters, with elegance and flourish. As Sophie, Jessica Biel is sensuously lovely and dewy-fresh, which is exactly what she needs to be. As Crown Prince Leopold, Rufus Sewell smolders with dark menace, a worthy inheritor of the mantle of the late Oliver Reed.

The Prince is determined that no one should possess greater power or cleverness than himself, so he insists that Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) uncover Eisenheim's secrets. What Uhl discovers is more volatile than trade secrets: Eisenheim has renewed a romance with his childhood friend Duchess Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel), whose expected marriage to Leopold is key to the Prince's political ambitions.While most period thrillers are burdened by their accoutrements, ""The Illusionist"" is immensely entertaining. And it couldn't look better. The film's deep blacks and rich browns are beautiful compliments to Eisenheim's inscrutable character. Phillip Glass' score is perfection -and as essential a component as the characters and visuals. Edward Norton, Rufus Sewell, and Paul Giamatti, playing three intelligent men with veiled ambitions, create the tension that drives the story. Sewell is particularly memorable as a powerful man frustrated politically and now personally, a consummate rationalist  who sometimes fails to master his own emotions. Prince Leopold is fictional but was evidently inspired by the mysteries surrounding the death of the real Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria.A few weaknesses in the script prevent ""The Illusionist"" from being a 5-star movie for me: The romance is a bit feeble. The Duchess is too old to be a suitable match for the Crown Prince, as her prime child-bearing years are past. The principle problem in the story that sets Eisenheim scheming and the plot in motion could be resolved by much simpler means. So it's not quite convincing. But these characters are fascinating. The magic is captivating. The production reproduced the conjuring acts by the same methods they would have been performed a century ago, to the extent that it was possible. The great practitioner and historian of the magic arts Ricky Jay consulted on the film. ""The Illusionist"" is thoroughly enjoyable and bound to inspire awe for magicians past and present.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): Bonus features include 2 short interview pieces, a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min), and an audio commentary. ""The Making of The Illusionist"" (4 min) features interviews with the cast in which they talk about their characters and the film. ""Jessica Biel on The Illusionist"" (1 1/2 min) mostly repeats the interview from ""The Making of..."". The audio commentary by writer/director Neil Burger is the best bonus feature. Burger discusses the film's themes of class, power, and uncertain reality, casting, period manners, telling the story from Uhl's point of view, and filming challenges. He also reveals how the magic tricks were done and what enhancements were made for the film. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.",4,Immensely Entertaining and Entrancing Turn-of-the-Century Thriller.,1168560000,"01 12, 2007",2007,3152,"['Neil', 'Burger', 'created', 'rare', 'successful', 'period', 'thriller', 'Illusionist', 'wrote', 'directed', 'inspired', 'Steven', 'Millhauser', 'short', 'story', 'Eisenheim', 'Illusionist', 'Vienna', 'circa', '1900', 'astonishing', 'illusionist', 'named', 'Eisenheim', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'such', 'great', 'fame', 'admiration', 'conjuring', 'feats', 'inspire', 'jealousy', 'Austria', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Prince', 'determined', 'one', 'should', 'possess', 'greater', 'power', 'cleverness', 'so', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Eisenheim', 'secrets', 'What', 'Uhl', 'more', 'volatile', 'trade', 'secrets', 'Eisenheim', 'renewed', 'romance', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Duchess', 'Sophie', 'von', 'Teschen', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'expected', 'marriage', 'Leopold', 'key', 'Prince', 'political', 'ambitions.While', 'most', 'period', 'thrillers', 'are', 'burdened', 'accoutrements', 'Illusionist', 'immensely', 'entertaining', 'could', ""n't"", 'look', 'better', 'film', 'deep', 'blacks', 'rich', 'browns', 'are', 'beautiful', 'compliments', 'Eisenheim', 'inscrutable', 'character', 'Phillip', 'Glass', 'score', 'perfection', '-and', 'essential', 'component', 'characters', 'visuals', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'playing', 'three', 'intelligent', 'men', 'veiled', 'ambitions', 'create', 'tension', 'story', 'Sewell', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'powerful', 'man', 'frustrated', 'politically', 'now', 'personally', 'consummate', 'rationalist', 'who', 'sometimes', 'master', 'own', 'emotions', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'fictional', 'was', 'evidently', 'inspired', 'mysteries', 'surrounding', 'death', 'real', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Rudolph', 'Austria.A', 'few', 'weaknesses', 'script', 'prevent', 'Illusionist', 'being', '5-star', 'movie', 'romance', 'bit', 'feeble', 'Duchess', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'suitable', 'match', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'prime', 'child-bearing', 'years', 'are', 'past', 'principle', 'problem', 'story', 'Eisenheim', 'scheming', 'plot', 'motion', 'could', 'be', 'resolved', 'much', 'simpler', 'means', 'not', 'quite', 'convincing', 'characters', 'are', 'fascinating', 'magic', 'captivating', 'production', 'reproduced', 'conjuring', 'acts', 'same', 'methods', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'performed', 'century', 'ago', 'extent', 'was', 'possible', 'great', 'practitioner', 'historian', 'magic', 'arts', 'Ricky', 'Jay', 'consulted', 'film', 'Illusionist', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'bound', 'inspire', 'awe', 'magicians', 'past', 'present.The', 'DVD', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', '2007', 'Bonus', 'features', 'include', '2', 'short', 'interview', 'pieces', 'theatrical', 'trailer', '2', '1/2', 'min', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Making', 'Illusionist', '4', 'min', 'interviews', 'cast', 'talk', 'characters', 'film', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Illusionist', '1', '1/2', 'min', 'mostly', 'interview', 'Making', 'audio', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Neil', 'Burger', 'best', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Burger', 'film', 'themes', 'class', 'power', 'uncertain', 'reality', 'casting', 'period', 'manners', 'telling', 'story', 'Uhl', 'point', 'view', 'filming', 'challenges', 'also', 'how', 'magic', 'tricks', 'were', 'done', 'what', 'enhancements', 'were', 'made', 'film', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'film', 'English', 'Spanish']",N/A

She becomes the beautiful, strong-minded woman a crown prince needs to complete his particular ambitions for power. The illusionist performs, and suddenly, the city is under his spell. Is it real, what he does? Or it is just tricks? And will the Chief Inspector of Police be able to contain the growing danger, the political and social and personal repercussions, of the illusionist's actions, which increasingly incite treasonous (if true) accusations from his captivated audiences?The game is on, and it's on at many levels, personal and social and in the very palaces of power.The ending is, well, look at the title of the movie, watch the film,  and take a wild guess at how it ends. You may be right, as I was. No surprise.And yet, some pleasure. Quite a bit of pleasure. Even my hard to enthrall hubby sat through the whole thing and didn't once say, ""Gee, how long is this thing anyway?"" as he usually does when I put on a DVD. :)I like Edward Norton. I find his odd looks interesting, and I enjoy his acting talent. I find him versatile and with an air of depth about him that adds quite a bit to his dramatic endeavors, even when they are small, like his part in FRIDA. The man stands out for me.Jessica Biel surprised me. I'd only seen in her in one other, hardly satisfying film, the third in the BLADE series, so to see her convincingly elegant and intense (if not particularly brilliant) was a special and unexpected treat.Rufus Sewell has done royalty before (Charles II), and he has done bad boys before. He's got a sort of ferocity behind those eyes (one somewhat wall-eyed, which adds to the air of oddity) and he can act, for sure. He has a masculine power that makes him believable as a sadistic exploiter of women.But Paul Giamatti. Wow. I wouldn't have imagined this almost non-descript, unsexy guy could steal a movie, but steal it he does, right out from Norton's and Sewell's much more attractive noses. He's a complex character, walking that line between corruption and integrity, and that's always fascinating to watch, much more interesting than a mere good guy or a mere bad guy. Delightful. And the series of expressions on his face at the end, when he figures out what happens (for himself, for the audience) is a marvel to behold.The cinematography, the use of dark/light, the occasional startling use of red, the music, all these make for a terrific visual ride. One can forgive the giving of too many clues that ruin the surprise just for the fact that it's delicious to sit and watch these images unfold.And Norton manages to move beautifully as the illusionist--the hands, especially. He convinces me that he is what he is.The tricks are always fun to watch. I""m not so jaded that I can't have fun with it. Or the director and actors just make it fun. Whatever.Great tension (sexual and otherwise) between actors, and a bit of romance (love that first kiss, ahhh), and a glimpse at the power of people who will not be cowed by the powerful and corrupt.I recommend it for the above reasons.",4,"Not Much to the Twist, but Visually Appealing with Strong Performances",1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,3159,"['boy', 'humble', 'origins', 'girl', 'aristocratic', 'lineage', 'bond', 'young', 'ones', 'are', 'separated', 'gifted', 'illusionist', 'beautiful', 'strong-minded', 'woman', 'crown', 'prince', 'needs', 'complete', 'particular', 'ambitions', 'power', 'illusionist', 'performs', 'suddenly', 'city', 'spell', 'real', 'what', 'Or', 'just', 'tricks', 'will', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Police', 'be', 'able', 'contain', 'growing', 'danger', 'political', 'social', 'personal', 'repercussions', 'illusionist', 'actions', 'increasingly', 'incite', 'treasonous', 'true', 'accusations', 'captivated', 'audiences', 'game', 'many', 'levels', 'personal', 'social', 'very', 'palaces', 'power.The', 'ending', 'well', 'look', 'title', 'movie', 'watch', 'film', 'take', 'wild', 'guess', 'how', 'may', 'be', 'right', 'was', 'surprise.And', 'yet', 'pleasure', 'bit', 'pleasure', 'Even', 'hard', 'enthrall', 'hubby', 'sat', 'whole', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'once', 'say', 'Gee', 'how', 'long', 'thing', 'anyway', 'usually', 'when', 'put', 'DVD', 'like', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'find', 'odd', 'looks', 'interesting', 'enjoy', 'acting', 'talent', 'find', 'versatile', 'air', 'depth', 'quite', 'bit', 'dramatic', 'endeavors', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'small', 'part', 'FRIDA', 'man', 'out', 'me.Jessica', 'Biel', 'surprised', ""'d"", 'only', 'seen', 'one', 'other', 'hardly', 'satisfying', 'film', 'third', 'BLADE', 'series', 'see', 'convincingly', 'elegant', 'intense', 'not', 'particularly', 'brilliant', 'was', 'special', 'unexpected', 'treat.Rufus', 'Sewell', 'done', 'royalty', 'Charles', 'II', 'done', 'bad', 'boys', 'got', 'sort', 'ferocity', 'eyes', 'one', 'somewhat', 'wall-eyed', 'air', 'oddity', 'can', 'act', 'sure', 'masculine', 'power', 'believable', 'sadistic', 'exploiter', 'women.But', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Wow', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'imagined', 'almost', 'non-descript', 'unsexy', 'guy', 'could', 'steal', 'movie', 'steal', 'right', 'out', 'Norton', 'Sewell', 'much', 'more', 'attractive', 'noses', 'complex', 'character', 'walking', 'line', 'corruption', 'integrity', 'always', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'mere', 'good', 'guy', 'mere', 'bad', 'guy', 'Delightful', 'series', 'expressions', 'face', 'end', 'when', 'out', 'what', 'audience', 'marvel', 'behold.The', 'cinematography', 'use', 'dark/light', 'occasional', 'startling', 'use', 'red', 'music', 'make', 'terrific', 'visual', 'ride', 'One', 'can', 'forgive', 'giving', 'too', 'many', 'clues', 'ruin', 'surprise', 'just', 'fact', 'delicious', 'sit', 'watch', 'images', 'unfold.And', 'Norton', 'move', 'beautifully', 'illusionist', 'hands', 'especially', 'what', 'tricks', 'are', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'm', 'not', 'so', 'jaded', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'fun', 'director', 'actors', 'just', 'make', 'fun', 'Whatever.Great', 'tension', 'sexual', 'otherwise', 'actors', 'bit', 'romance', 'love', 'first', 'kiss', 'ahhh', 'glimpse', 'power', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'cowed', 'powerful', 'corrupt.I', 'recommend', 'above', 'reasons']",N/A

Filmed in sepia to reflect the early 1900's period that the story is set in, the overall feel and aura of the film was hanutingly excellent.The basic plot is that Edward Abrahamovich, (Eisenheim), and the Sophie, Countess von Techen cannot be together due to differences in family ranking. Eisenheim is not in the ""in crowd"". He vanishes and years later turns up in Venice, sporting a new name, a new profession and whole lot of cool. With illusions that defy explanation, he causes a stir, especially when he gets up the nose of the Emperor's son, Leopold, who is due to marry the same Countess von Techen from years before. Soon Eisenheim and Sophie are lovers and...well, see the film.Edward Norton plays a very calm and collected, (and quite cool), Eisenheim. Paul Giamatti was a particular surprise, giving a great performance as Leopold's toady, Inspector Uhl. All in all, the movie was very well acted, and all the actors and actresses set this film a cut above average.Although a romance, I thoroughly enjoyed the spectacle that this movie presented. In some ways, it almost drew one into the atmosphere of the film, and you could almost feel the wind of the raven's wings as Eisenheim throws his cloth out over the audience.Setting it in the early 20th century, filming it in sepia, and centering the plot on an illusionist all serve to the make the film a true work of art. Even if you are not a romance movie goer by nature, I would suggest at least giving this one a chance.

Gladly, it was great and I ended up adding to my collection which says a lot since I only buy movies that I feel have long term viewing value.The plot was a fairly basic ""poor boy meets rich girl"" with the usual forbidden relationship maneuvers. This storyline has been used before but the delivery of it and the magic background really made it fresh and original. I was totally submersed into the film within about 15-20 minutes which is always a good sign. I enjoyed the magic and the strange events surrounding the magic. Was it real?  An Illusion?  Mixed?  Was anyone else involved in making it all work or did the illusionist work alone?  These were all interesting points to ponder as the film rolled along.Character-wise the movie did a gerat job of building relationships between key people and allowing the viewers to actually care for most of them. Even the supposed ""bad guy""( Rufus Sewell) deserved our condolences as you will see. Ed Norton did his usual great job with his role and Paul Giamatti was excellent as the Police Inspector that was torn between whats right and wrong and whats best for his career. Jessica Biehl was a little bit out of her league here though and she was forcing her lines a little bit. This part was obviously a little bit of s stretch for her but she did try at least.  Her accent was sort of bad and again...she just wasnt that believable. Shes great looking though which doesnt hurt.I highly recommend this film. The scenery and atmosphere are terrific, the acting is mostly great, and there are enough interesting twists and turns to keep it fresh and interesting. It wasnt perfect by any means but few movies are. The key here is that they got this mostly right and its good enough to be watched more than once.Highly recommended!!!!",4,"Great movie, really impressed me....",1175644800,"04 4, 2007",2007,1918,"['wasnt', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'extremely', 'cheesey', 'little', 'room', 'Gladly', 'was', 'great', 'ended', 'up', 'adding', 'collection', 'lot', 'only', 'buy', 'movies', 'feel', 'have', 'long', 'term', 'viewing', 'value.The', 'plot', 'was', 'fairly', 'basic', 'poor', 'boy', 'meets', 'rich', 'girl', 'usual', 'forbidden', 'relationship', 'maneuvers', 'storyline', 'been', 'used', 'delivery', 'magic', 'background', 'really', 'made', 'fresh', 'original', 'was', 'totally', 'submersed', 'film', '15-20', 'minutes', 'always', 'good', 'sign', 'enjoyed', 'magic', 'strange', 'events', 'surrounding', 'magic', 'Was', 'real', 'Illusion', 'Mixed', 'Was', 'anyone', 'else', 'involved', 'making', 'work', 'did', 'illusionist', 'work', 'alone', 'were', 'interesting', 'points', 'ponder', 'film', 'rolled', 'along.Character-wise', 'movie', 'did', 'gerat', 'job', 'building', 'relationships', 'key', 'people', 'allowing', 'viewers', 'actually', 'care', 'most', 'Even', 'supposed', 'bad', 'guy', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'deserved', 'condolences', 'will', 'see', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'did', 'usual', 'great', 'job', 'role', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'was', 'excellent', 'Police', 'Inspector', 'was', 'torn', 'whats', 'right', 'wrong', 'whats', 'best', 'career', 'Jessica', 'Biehl', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'league', 'here', 'was', 'forcing', 'lines', 'little', 'bit', 'part', 'was', 'obviously', 'little', 'bit', 's', 'stretch', 'did', 'try', 'least', 'accent', 'was', 'sort', 'bad', 'again', 'just', 'wasnt', 'believable', 'Shes', 'great', 'looking', 'doesnt', 'hurt.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'scenery', 'atmosphere', 'are', 'terrific', 'acting', 'mostly', 'great', 'are', 'enough', 'interesting', 'twists', 'keep', 'fresh', 'interesting', 'wasnt', 'perfect', 'means', 'few', 'movies', 'are', 'key', 'here', 'got', 'mostly', 'right', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'watched', 'more', 'once.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

One factor that was especially disappointing: any discerning viewer could easily see what the final plot twist would be long before the secret is revealed. Still, it has a certain fascination for any fan of mystery and suspense, or Gothic detective stories involving the supernatural.EDWARD NORTON is Eisenheim, the magician who fascinates audiences with his clever sleight of hand and amazing tricks that seem to indicate he can bring to life dead spirits.PAUL GIAMATTI is effective as Inspector Uhl who doggedly determines to find out just what's going on behind the illusions, as much to placate his own need to know as it is to satisfy Crown Prince Leopold (RUFUS SEWELL) who has an agenda of his own for wanting the illusionist thrown into prison. It seems that his fianc&eacute; (JESSICA BIEL) has been a childhood sweetheart of the magician.Rufus Sewell gives the film's strongest performance as Crown Prince Leopold, with Norton appearing a bit uneasy in the pivotal role of the man behind the illusions.The film's biggest flaw is the last portion of the story, which has the inspector putting the pieces of the puzzle together as a last minute fix for the story's conclusion. It doesn't strike a truthful chord since the solution is much too intricate to be solved by fleeting fragments of the inspector's mind reviewing past events. It bears comparison to another recent film, THE PRESTIGE, which handled the same sort of material in an even more striking way.Summing up: Interesting, lots of atmosphere, beautifully photographed to capture the period with an appropriate background score by Paul Glass that is effective in setting the mood perfectly.",4,Impressive magic show...nothing is what it seems...,1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,1751,"['ILLUSIONIST', 'satisfying', 'magic', 'show', 'not', 'quite', 'standards', 'expected', 'One', 'factor', 'was', 'especially', 'disappointing', 'discerning', 'viewer', 'could', 'easily', 'see', 'what', 'final', 'plot', 'twist', 'would', 'be', 'long', 'secret', 'revealed', 'Still', 'certain', 'fascination', 'fan', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'Gothic', 'detective', 'stories', 'involving', 'supernatural.EDWARD', 'NORTON', 'Eisenheim', 'magician', 'who', 'audiences', 'clever', 'sleight', 'hand', 'amazing', 'tricks', 'seem', 'indicate', 'can', 'bring', 'life', 'dead', 'spirits.PAUL', 'GIAMATTI', 'effective', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'who', 'doggedly', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'going', 'illusions', 'as', 'much', 'placate', 'own', 'need', 'know', 'satisfy', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'RUFUS', 'SEWELL', 'who', 'agenda', 'own', 'wanting', 'illusionist', 'thrown', 'prison', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'JESSICA', 'BIEL', 'been', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'magician.Rufus', 'Sewell', 'film', 'strongest', 'performance', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'Norton', 'appearing', 'bit', 'uneasy', 'pivotal', 'role', 'man', 'illusions.The', 'film', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'last', 'portion', 'story', 'inspector', 'putting', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'together', 'last', 'minute', 'fix', 'story', 'conclusion', ""n't"", 'strike', 'truthful', 'chord', 'solution', 'much', 'too', 'intricate', 'be', 'solved', 'fleeting', 'fragments', 'inspector', 'mind', 'reviewing', 'past', 'events', 'comparison', 'recent', 'film', 'THE', 'PRESTIGE', 'handled', 'same', 'sort', 'material', 'even', 'more', 'striking', 'way.Summing', 'up', 'Interesting', 'lots', 'atmosphere', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'capture', 'period', 'appropriate', 'background', 'score', 'Paul', 'Glass', 'effective', 'setting', 'mood', 'perfectly']",N/A

The story is set in 1900s Vienna, and the costumes and scenery are certainly appropriate for that time period.  The story traces the life of a young magician (who was first taught by a wandering magician he came in contact with) as he meets with a young Duchess and tries to win her love.  However, the two are forced to separate because the young man is a peasant and the Duchess is royalty and such an accommodation is inconceivable to the people of the time.  After their forced separation the young magician travels to the Orient where he learns the secrets of the ""dark arts"".  It is only then that he returns to Vienna as the illusionist and stage magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton).  The magic tricks of Eisenheim are particularly complex, and seeing as how they have no apparent and conceivable manner in which they could be accomplished many attribute them to the supernatural.  It is while performing on stage however that Eisenheim meets with the Duchess Sophie (Jessica Biel) again in a daring encounter with death that invokes the immortality of the soul.  As it turns out however, Duchess Sophie is to be wed to Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), who not only challenges the tricks of the magician but also is notoriously ruthless and cruel (and even rumored to have beaten his previous mistress and possibly killed her).  The story involves a profound encounter with death and raises the question of the nature of the soul.  Indeed, the police Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) is also to enter this story as the plot unravels.  Ultimately a conflict ensues between the Crown Prince and the magician that must be settled in a very disturbing manner.  Further, the emerging spiritualist movement plays some role in this story as the magician invokes the spirits of the dead.  Spiritualism (which was often linked to socialism and various reform movements) is invoked by the people as a means to achieve a ""spiritual republic"".  Such subversive activities are of course frowned upon by the powers that be.  The movie ultimately raises the question of the existence of the supernatural and the survival of the soul after death.  To see how this is resolved within the movie, you must watch it.  However, as a story the movie is a classic tale of love that knows no bounds (neither the separation in social class nor the separation of the grave can drive the lovers apart).  I found this movie to be excellently done.  The story is interesting, the magic tricks are impressive, the characters were well played, and the setting was as I would expect the turn-of-the-century in Vienna.

Audiences are astounded by the illusions he performs - making an orange tree grow before their eyes, levitating things, etc. Hearing of these magnificent feats from an impressed Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), the Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell) decides to attend a performance, bringing with him his soon-to-be fiancee Sophie (Jessica Biel). (Unbeknownst to the Crown Prince, Eisenheim and Sophie were childhood sweethearts.) Convinced that he can debunk Eisenheim's tricks, the Crown Prince demands a private royal performance, and the magician obliges. However, once gathered before the royalty and the court, the Crown Prince is unable to explain away Eisenheim's masterful illusions.Perturbed by the magician, the Crown Prince sends Inspector Uhl to find out more about this magician and how he performs such wonders. During the investigation, Uhl himself develops a healthy respect for Eisenheim, even as he learns that the magician has rekindled his affair with Sophie.Although you'll see the ending coming, this is a great movie. What makes it worth it: the performances of Norton and Giamatti. (Particularly, Norton's lovesick magician. I only wish that being apart from me could inspire such anguish in a man.) The effects in Eisenheim's stage shows are nice as well, and I like it that the magician's secrets are not divulged. Also, I love how the script comments on some rather weighty issues. Eisenheim introduces each trick with a philosophical exposition, which serves as set-up, distraction, and fodder for the mind.

Going in, I was expecting mainly a chick-flick (since my wife recommended it, and that's her main taste), and although this had a strong romantic theme it was anything but a chick-flick.  It's full of mystery, political intrigue, and plenty of suspense as well -- overall a very well balanced film.The feel and flavor of late-nineteenth century Vienna were very well done, particularly in the use of lighting and color (or rather, disuse of both elements -- lots of dark, drab scenes).  I thought Paul Giamatti was well cast as Chief Inspector Uhl, a man caught between his own ambitions and integrity.  I recently saw him as well in ""Lady in the Water"", and this newer role demonstrates his versatility as an actor.  Even better, I thought Ed Norton was excellent as Eisenheim, and got great support from Jessica Biel.  In my humble opinion only Rufus Sewell as crown prince Leopold was a little overdone, leaning disturbingly toward melodrama, but the other actors compensated nicely.As to the story itself, it has just enough of a blend of fairy tale, fantasy, realism and plausibility to appeal to a wide range of viewers.  The end offers a surprising twist that some may suspect but few fully understand or appreciate -- if they're honest about it.

Some people could nod their heads at it and tell you it was entertaining. Others would hesitate, only to be polite, and say it just wasn't worth seeing. In my experience, not many people had very strong feelings one way or the other. And many people preferred to focus on whether or not it was better than The Prestige instead of discussing the movie on its own merits. I won't claim the moral high-ground, admittedly I have not seen The Prestige; all I have to go on is The Illusionist. And I liked it.The casting is better than luke-warm. The movie features the on-the-rise career of Paul Giamatti and the long-overdue return of Ed Norton. Giamatti acted his way onto the map with a highly praised performance in American Splendor, though he is probably most well-known for his role in the Sideways. If you have read my reviews before, this may not be the first time you see me point to the movie Confidence. It is the movie to which I would say Paul Giamatti's role is most comparable (and one of my favorite movies). In both movies he toes the line between the moral and immoral, while bringing a strong breadth of character. In the Illusionist he has a larger part, so you are able to enjoy his very-likeable personality in greater supply.Edward Norton has delivered some very noteworthy performances over his career. I can only wish for him to get more work; I enjoy what he does. He does not seem to work at the same pace as many in-demand actors today. Maybe he prefers more time off, or maybe I am the lone voice of support for his career. Either way, I thought he did a great job as lead in The Illusionist, where he brought the same ""I'm better than you"" arrogance that he gave us in Rounders. It seemed effortless as he settled into a character who is not too over-the-top. Knowledge is power, and his character knew what others did not.The story was a new flavor of an old dish. The creators here took the often-used template for a crescendo of suspense which carries you safely into the heart of an exhilarating plot twist. What they added was magic, literally. (Sure it was good, but you know what I mean.) I really enjoy magicians and their craft. I liked the way the creative team for The Illusionist was able to bring this story to life. The only thing I longed for was more magic. A few more slight-of-hand tricks would have made me very happy, though I understand that there wasn't necessarily any good place for them to be added.I hope that you are neither too proud of yourself, nor disappointed should you predict the twist. The strength of the movie is less in the surprise and more in the execution.

1032468,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B000K7VHPU,P. Hardy,"[3, 3]","While spending the day with my brother (who had return to Utah soon), my parents suggested that we go to the theater to see ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,"" - ""Monster House,"" or ""The Illusionist"", ----- a film my brother wanted to see before he left. Naturally there was a disagreement between the youngest and oldest of the family because my brother had already seen Dead Man's chest. Nothing more was said about it and thus as we headed out I naturally assumed we had agreed on seeing Pirates Of The Caribbean, though I had my doubts. Naturally my doubts were solidified when I entered the theater and caught the neon sign that read ""The illusionist."" My sister and I were right mad that we had been tricked by our parents into seeing a movie we had no desire to see at all. Grudgingly I decided to fall purposely asleep just to spite them.Well, my plan backfired. I ended up watching the film anyway.At first glance the film didn't seem to build up to much especially since they started off without much introduction to what was actually going on. Edward Norton's character, Eisenheim, is shown being arrested by Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) for crimes (or high treason) against the crown Prince Leopold for reasons unknown. From there Inspector Uhl returns to the Prince and briefs him on what he leaned of the Magician. As a young man named Edward, he lived with his family and helped out with carptentry. On one fateful day he met an old man on a path. There the old man shows the young man a magic trick before supposedly vanishing himself, taking along with him the tree that sheltered him (according to rumors most likely to be outlandish). From there the young Edward takes a strong liking to magic to the point where he is emerged in its rituals almost every single day. As luck would have it he happens to meet the daughter of a well off family, named Sophie. The two become friends, Edward shares everything with Sophie and the two eventually become lovers of the forbidden kind. Sophie's family forbids the young woman ever to see Edward again. One night the two run off into the woods in hopes to runaway from their respective lives when Sophie's bodyguards find them and separate the two. Edward disappears soon there afterward, never to be heard from again.From there Inspector Uhl explains with great detail, events that took place before the arresting of the magician Eisenheim. The storyline for this movie brilliantly crafted in a way that will certainly surprise the viewer. Throughout the movie -- after the reunion of Sophie [now Duchess and betrothal to Prince Leopold] and Edward -- the storyline has you believing in one scenario when in truth its entirely different thing all together. One would presume to have the story all worked out upon discovering Eisenheim plans to run away with the Duchess, that the movie is as predicable as it is mystifying. But it truth the movie fools you right to the very end, and is sure to leave your mouth hanging agape with awe. In spite of my ill temper, I found the movie to be overly entertaining. I was well aware of Giamatti's talents as an actor so it came to no surprise his performance as Inspector Uhl, was quite believable. Rufus Sewell was excellent in his role as the abusive and controlling Leopold, a person who, despite his foul persona, I ended up feeling sorry for in the end. Edward Norton, whom really isn't my favorite actor, proves in this film that he be a reasonably likable character beyond the usual 'scum bag' he portrays, and does it well. Everything about the character Eisenheim is believable and equally amazing; The magic tricks he performs are impressive. However, the one actor that amazed me the most was Jessica Biel as Duchess Sophie; I honestly was not convinced that she could play characters beyond the typecast 21st century girlfriend (of the scornful kind), or ""Abigail Whistler"" of BLADE: TRINITY. Biel's performance did not remind you of any the roles she played beforehand, which proved to me that she was a genuine actress.The CGI utilized in this film was also quite well; The Phantoms lurking about in the film when Eisenheim is down on his luck, were crafted well in the ghostly like manner. Thankfully not a lot of it was used in the film, but whenever it was used it borderlined between believably real to obviously animated. The music, composed by Philp Glass, truly intensified the atmosphere of this period piece with romantic and sorrowful melodies sure to tug at the heartstrings. All in all THE ILLUSIONIST is sure to dazzle audiences with it sharp storytelling, romance, and characters. A highly recommended movie, sure to leave you surprised, a feat I believed no movie to do any longer. ---- [a 4 out of 5]",4,The Illusionist doesn't fail to disappoint with surprises....,1181088000,"06 6, 2007",2007,4744,"['spending', 'day', 'brother', 'who', 'had', 'return', 'Utah', 'soon', 'parents', 'suggested', 'go', 'theater', 'see', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Chest', 'Monster', 'House', 'Illusionist', 'film', 'brother', 'wanted', 'see', 'left', 'Naturally', 'was', 'disagreement', 'youngest', 'oldest', 'family', 'brother', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'Dead', 'Man', 'chest', 'Nothing', 'more', 'was', 'said', 'thus', 'headed', 'out', 'naturally', 'assumed', 'had', 'agreed', 'seeing', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'had', 'doubts', 'Naturally', 'doubts', 'were', 'solidified', 'when', 'entered', 'theater', 'caught', 'neon', 'sign', 'read', 'illusionist', 'sister', 'were', 'right', 'mad', 'had', 'been', 'tricked', 'parents', 'seeing', 'movie', 'had', 'desire', 'see', 'Grudgingly', 'decided', 'fall', 'purposely', 'asleep', 'just', 'spite', 'them.Well', 'plan', 'backfired', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'film', 'anyway.At', 'first', 'glance', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'build', 'up', 'much', 'especially', 'started', 'off', 'much', 'introduction', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'going', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'character', 'Eisenheim', 'shown', 'being', 'arrested', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'crimes', 'high', 'treason', 'crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'Prince', 'briefs', 'what', 'leaned', 'Magician', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Edward', 'lived', 'family', 'helped', 'out', 'carptentry', 'one', 'fateful', 'day', 'met', 'old', 'man', 'path', 'old', 'man', 'young', 'man', 'magic', 'trick', 'supposedly', 'vanishing', 'taking', 'along', 'tree', 'sheltered', 'according', 'rumors', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'outlandish', 'young', 'Edward', 'strong', 'liking', 'magic', 'point', 'where', 'emerged', 'rituals', 'almost', 'single', 'day', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'meet', 'daughter', 'well', 'family', 'named', 'Sophie', 'two', 'become', 'friends', 'Edward', 'shares', 'everything', 'Sophie', 'two', 'eventually', 'become', 'lovers', 'forbidden', 'kind', 'Sophie', 'family', 'young', 'woman', 'ever', 'see', 'Edward', 'again', 'One', 'night', 'two', 'run', 'off', 'woods', 'hopes', 'runaway', 'respective', 'lives', 'when', 'Sophie', 'bodyguards', 'find', 'separate', 'two', 'Edward', 'soon', 'there', 'afterward', 'never', 'be', 'heard', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'great', 'detail', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'arresting', 'magician', 'Eisenheim', 'storyline', 'movie', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'way', 'will', 'certainly', 'surprise', 'viewer', 'movie', 'reunion', 'Sophie', '[', 'now', 'Duchess', 'betrothal', 'Prince', 'Leopold', ']', 'Edward', 'storyline', 'believing', 'one', 'scenario', 'when', 'truth', 'entirely', 'different', 'thing', 'together', 'One', 'would', 'presume', 'have', 'story', 'worked', 'out', 'discovering', 'Eisenheim', 'run', 'away', 'Duchess', 'movie', 'as', 'predicable', 'mystifying', 'movie', 'right', 'very', 'end', 'sure', 'leave', 'mouth', 'hanging', 'agape', 'awe', 'spite', 'ill', 'temper', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'overly', 'entertaining', 'was', 'well', 'aware', 'Giamatti', 'talents', 'actor', 'came', 'surprise', 'performance', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'was', 'quite', 'believable', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'was', 'excellent', 'role', 'abusive', 'controlling', 'Leopold', 'person', 'who', 'foul', 'persona', 'ended', 'up', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'end', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'whom', 'really', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'actor', 'film', 'be', 'reasonably', 'likable', 'character', 'usual', 'bag', 'well', 'Everything', 'character', 'Eisenheim', 'believable', 'equally', 'amazing', 'magic', 'are', 'impressive', 'However', 'one', 'actor', 'amazed', 'most', 'was', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Duchess', 'Sophie', 'honestly', 'was', 'not', 'convinced', 'could', 'play', 'characters', 'typecast', '21st', 'century', 'girlfriend', 'scornful', 'kind', 'Abigail', 'Whistler', 'BLADE', 'TRINITY', 'Biel', 'performance', 'did', 'not', 'remind', 'roles', 'played', 'beforehand', 'proved', 'was', 'genuine', 'actress.The', 'CGI', 'utilized', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'well', 'Phantoms', 'lurking', 'about', 'film', 'when', 'Eisenheim', 'down', 'luck', 'were', 'crafted', 'well', 'ghostly', 'manner', 'Thankfully', 'not', 'lot', 'was', 'used', 'film', 'whenever', 'was', 'used', 'borderlined', 'believably', 'real', 'obviously', 'animated', 'music', 'composed', 'Philp', 'Glass', 'truly', 'intensified', 'atmosphere', 'period', 'piece', 'romantic', 'sorrowful', 'melodies', 'sure', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'ILLUSIONIST', 'sure', 'dazzle', 'audiences', 'sharp', 'storytelling', 'romance', 'characters', 'highly', 'recommended', 'movie', 'sure', 'leave', 'surprised', 'feat', 'believed', 'movie', 'do', 'longer', '[', '4', '5', ']']",N/A

If the movie will do one thing, it's keep you on the edge of your seat looking for the next surprise.The love story, and then crime story that carry the plot seem to bring with them that same slick, fun, crafted appeal. However, all said and done, this can also be where if I had to point out flaws, I would say they lie. For instance the romance is central to the story but has about 2 minutes screen time, no joke. With that being the case, the viewer may wonder, why do I care about these people? It's fun to watch the magic act unfold, but the characters in the end don't reveal their souls to us very much, just their faces.That being the case I would say this movie is a very fun watch, but low down the scale of really engaging your brain or emotions afterwards.

I've read the other reviews, and, yes, Philip Glass' score certainly adds to the tension or romance, as applicable (even though he can't get away from the arpeggiated mannerisms and repetition, as in ""Koyaanisquatsi""). Both the photography and production design ring true. ""The Illusionist"" is definitely NOT an action film, though its deliberate pace will not fail to hold you spellbound. The acting is letter-perfect from Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti & Jessica Biel, and Rufus Sewell's bad-guy Prince is one of the very best I've seen in many years.

It has an intellectual impact, it pleases because it shows a time and situation unfamiliar to us and it entertains with its originality and execution.  But at no time are we caught up in a sweep of emotions.  We observe from a distance.It tells the story of Eisenheim The Illusionist (Edward Norton), an unparalled ""magician"" who returns to his childhood home of Vienna after traveling the world in search of the greatest illusions ever seen.  He causes an immediate stir with his brilliance, and attracts the attention of the young heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne (Rufus Sewell) and his young bride-to-be (Jessica Biehl), who also happens to be the childhood sweetheart of Eisenheim.They rekindle their relationship.  Meanwhile, Eisenheim has captured the interest of young royal heir, and not in a good way.  The prince imagines that he is smarter than Eisenheim, and when he can't immediately expose the method behind the illusions, he becomes resentful, and sends the police (led by Paul Giamatti) on a mission to destroy Eisenheim.It's a good story, and it takes some nice turns, particularly when Eisenheim and his true love conspire to get away from the prince...and the seemingly tragic results of that effort.  The movie beautifully captures old Vienna.  It is remarkably intelligent and doesn't insult its audience.  And it has some really great magic tricks.  Naturally, we know the tricks are created through special effects...however, what is GREAT is that the film allows us to sort of put ourselves in the audience of late 19th century Vienna...and to feel just a little how stunning his illusions would have been.  We spend the whole movie wondering if he is an illusionist or if he really can do the tricks.Edward Norton is very intense in his role, and with his VanDyke beard, he looks terrific.  A true leading-man kind of part for him.  He's riveting.  Giamatti and Sewell have terrible facial hair, but otherwise do nice work.  Giamatti does struggle a bit making his ""Viennese"" accent believable, though.  Biehl, while hardly asked to leap through huge dramatic hoops, does just fine amongst these greater actors...and  I suppose if you're one of those who voted her ""Sexiest Woman Alive,"" you'll probably enjoy her a great deal.But somehow, the movie remains distant emotionally in telling the romance.  We just don't CARE all that much.  Yes, we want the good guys to win and the bad guys to get their comeuppance.  But not in a deep way.  No tears are shed.  The movie spends so much time EXAMINING things...the illusions, the schemes, the political machinations...that it forgets to just let emotion run free a bit.  It's very controlled and has a leisurely pace.I admire it a great deal, and recommend it.  It's PG-13, but except for one brief ""bedroom"" scene with Norton and Biehl that isn't terribly explicit, I think it could almost have been PG.

I didn't, ad I liked it a great deal.Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is an illusionist. In flashback, we find out that as a young boy, he had a relationship with a girl well outside his station before the two of them were forcibly separated; fifteen years later, he returns to Vienna as an accomplished magician, and catches the eye of Leopold, the crown prince (Dark City's Rufus Sewell). Who is Leopold's betrothed? The same woman, of course, Sophie (Jessica Biel). Eisenheim and Sophie make advances toward picking up where they left off, but of course there's royalty in the way. Leopold gets his pet policeman, inspector Uhl (Sideways' Paul Giamatti) to investigate Eisenheim. You know this will not end well.The film is complex, and quite pretty to boot. Burger (Interview with the Assassin) has all his ducks in a row here, and knows where to place them for maximum effect. There are some weak points, of course, but surprisingly, Biel isn't one of them; this is easily her best performance since Ulee's Gold a decade ago. There seemed a few places where the script was rushed, as if the director had wanted to spend more time investigating certain plot tangents, and it's usually the case that doing so makes for a stronger movie, but those are pretty easily overlooked.

I was excited to give this DVD a spin and see if it lived up to its expectations.  The movie itself was solidly entertaining, but not as good as I hoped.The Illusionist captures the feel of the Victorian era quite well, plunging you into Vienna at a time before World War I.  The camera work and overall look of the film captures a silent era feel, adding to the atmosphere, but not distracting too much.  The sound is especially immersive during the scenes where Eisenheim is performing his magic.For the most part the cast does a great job.  Edward Norton is very believable as Eisenheim, capturing the characters emotions as well as he theatrical nature when he is on stage.  Paul Giamatti plays the persistent police inspector as a man who admires the illusionist, but is forced to work against him.  Rufus Sewell plays the crown prince as a nasty villain you want to see get his just desserts.  The only weak link is Jessica Biel.  It could be my problem, but she didn't seem to fit into the period as much as the other actors did.  She seemed too contemporary, and pulled me out of the movie.The score by Philip Glass is also distracting.  At times it works well, at others it's meandering strings and piano caused me to focus on it instead of the film itself.  Neil Burger's direction is solid and he makes the movie work.  The script is simple, but entertaining.As a whole the movie keeps you entertained.

1032493,A6FIAB28IS79,B000K7VHPU,Samuel Chell,"[1, 1]","From the very beginnings of cinema, especially with the turn-of-the-century movies of the great French magician, Georges Melies, film has been the ultimate illusion.  It's the amateur spectator who perceives the movies as a ""documentation of reality."" Orson Welles, for one, knew better, saying ""Film is a ribbon of dreams.""  And as the illusionist tells his agitated admirers out in the streets: ""Everything you've seen is an illusion, a trick. Go home and don't be upset.""Accordingly, the first step toward the full appreciation of film is to see every great movie as a ""construct"" of the director, not as a ""record of reality.""  The Chief Inspector (Paul Giamatti) is the ideal spectator.  In his first confrontation with the Illusionist, he is allowed to see through Illusionist's illusion to the cause-effect logic behind the deception (identifying the behind-the-back hand that holds an object).  He, like the spectator, has seen a deception exposed, though something in us simultaneously wishes to believe in the magic.  As he tells the Illusionist (Edward Norton) during their final conversation, ""I don't know whether you actually bring these people back from the 'other side' or are playing some great trick on us.  But I do know that you're special."" Alfred Hitchcock may not have put Gary Grant on the face of Mt. Rushmore, but we nonetheless believe whole-heartedly in the director's sleight of hand even as we appreciate and applaud his inventiveness.But then we reach the final scene of the film and not only witness but participate in an ever-crescendoing epiphany of joy, one which we share with the Chief Inspector, as he (along with the spectator) finally puts the pieces together: he figures out the illusion. It's ironic that many experienced filmgoers can become so savvy about special effects and complain that the ""blood didn't look real,"" etc., yet fail in this instance to be in step with let alone ahead of the Inspector.  Yet the film presents us not with ""real"" scenery and backgrounds but with painting after painting, fabrication after fabrication. We should have known all along (but the movie wouldn't have been better for it).No matter that the film is an adult ""fairy tale"" in which everything ends ""happily ever after"": we believe in it all the more strongly once we're able to discover that it is such a tale.  Or, to invoke a poet (Coleridge) from before the age of cinema, the film celebrates movies as the ultimate ""suspension of disbelief.""This movie is as smart as they come--made for intelligent viewers who have had their fill of inferior formulaic and ""family"" film fare.  Not that the film's cleverness and sophistication should limit the size, or mitigate the pleasure, of its audience.  For a change, the spectator has an opportunity to have it both ways: to quote our poet once again, he can emerge a ""wiser man""--but without being sadder.[The Blu-Ray version did not strike me as having stunning clarity lacking in the standard version.  But perhaps upon watching the film a 2nd time in Blu-Ray, the spectator who was ""tricked"" the first time, will be more alert to the fabrications employed in the filmmaking process.]",5,The Key: The Chief Inspector and the Spectator are ONE,1308009600,"06 14, 2011",2011,3169,"['very', 'beginnings', 'cinema', 'especially', 'turn-of-the-century', 'movies', 'great', 'French', 'magician', 'Georges', 'Melies', 'film', 'been', 'ultimate', 'illusion', 'amateur', 'spectator', 'who', 'movies', 'documentation', 'reality', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'one', 'knew', 'better', 'saying', 'Film', 'ribbon', 'dreams', 'illusionist', 'agitated', 'admirers', 'out', 'streets', 'Everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'illusion', 'trick', 'Go', 'home', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'upset', 'Accordingly', 'first', 'step', 'full', 'appreciation', 'film', 'see', 'great', 'movie', 'construct', 'director', 'not', 'record', 'reality', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'ideal', 'spectator', 'first', 'confrontation', 'Illusionist', 'allowed', 'see', 'Illusionist', 'illusion', 'cause-effect', 'logic', 'deception', 'identifying', 'behind-the-back', 'hand', 'object', 'spectator', 'seen', 'deception', 'exposed', 'something', 'simultaneously', 'believe', 'magic', 'Illusionist', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'final', 'conversation', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'actually', 'bring', 'people', 'back', ""'other"", 'side', 'are', 'playing', 'great', 'trick', 'do', 'know', ""'re"", 'special', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'put', 'Gary', 'Grant', 'face', 'Mt', 'Rushmore', 'nonetheless', 'believe', 'whole-heartedly', 'director', 'sleight', 'hand', 'even', 'appreciate', 'applaud', 'inventiveness.But', 'then', 'reach', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'witness', 'participate', 'ever-crescendoing', 'epiphany', 'joy', 'one', 'share', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'spectator', 'finally', 'pieces', 'together', 'out', 'illusion', 'ironic', 'many', 'experienced', 'filmgoers', 'can', 'become', 'so', 'savvy', 'special', 'effects', 'complain', 'blood', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'real', 'etc.', 'yet', 'fail', 'instance', 'be', 'step', 'let', 'alone', 'ahead', 'Inspector', 'film', 'presents', 'not', 'real', 'scenery', 'backgrounds', 'painting', 'painting', 'fabrication', 'fabrication', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'matter', 'film', 'adult', 'fairy', 'tale', 'everything', 'happily', 'ever', 'believe', 'more', 'strongly', ""'re"", 'able', 'discover', 'such', 'tale', 'invoke', 'poet', 'Coleridge', 'age', 'cinema', 'film', 'movies', 'ultimate', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'movie', 'as', 'smart', 'come', 'made', 'intelligent', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'fill', 'inferior', 'formulaic', 'family', 'film', 'fare', 'Not', 'film', 'cleverness', 'sophistication', 'should', 'limit', 'size', 'mitigate', 'pleasure', 'audience', 'change', 'spectator', 'opportunity', 'have', 'ways', 'quote', 'poet', 'once', 'again', 'can', 'emerge', 'wiser', 'man', 'being', 'sadder', '[', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'did', 'not', 'strike', 'having', 'stunning', 'clarity', 'lacking', 'standard', 'version', 'perhaps', 'watching', 'film', '2nd', 'time', 'Blu-Ray', 'spectator', 'who', 'was', 'tricked', 'first', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'alert', 'fabrications', 'employed', 'filmmaking', 'process', ']']",N/A
1032494,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000K7VHPU,Samuel McKewon,"[2, 5]","""The Illusionist"" bills itself as a turn-of-century head trip of narrative twists and inexplicable sorcery. And while the last half of the movie is an elaborate con, the true strength of writer/director Neil Burger's film is a simple romantic tale of love lost and found, featuring quartet of effective performances - including one from Jessica Biel.Yes, Jessica Biel, who adds a little acting to go with those lips and that hair. She's Sophie, a Hungarian countess who discovers a ""forbidden"" lover has become Eisenheim The Illusionist (Edward Norton). Eisenheim's tricks are seamless. It's also too quick for the magic-savvy crowds of Vienna, who can't unravel just how he grows that orange tree, or manages to freeze the sword of Austrian Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) so that no ""unworthy"" man can tug it off the ground.Leopold considers himself a divine intellectual above any trickery he can`t figure out, so he orders Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to shut Eisenheim down. By then, Sophie, who promises to marry the prince as part of a plan to overthrow Leopold's father, has shared a forbidden carriage ride with Eisenheim, and is ripe to share his bed, too.""Do you really want to disappear with me?"" he asks her.""The Illusionist"" then shifts into its hour-long final act, which involves a murder, jewels and voodoo magic that has the peasants rioting. Berger adapted Steven Millhauser's short story and added the romantic angle while flattening the depth of Inspector Uhl, rescued by Giamatti with mild humor and humility.Berger's twist - the ""turn"" in magician-speak -  is clever but predictable. ""The Illusionist"" has too gentle a soul - and too modest an aim - to end any other way,  but it works because Norton and Biel generate an understated chemistry; there's a lot of passion under their benign, expressionless faces.  Norton's is nobody's first choice as a romantic lead, which makes him more effective as a magician. Biel effectively plays against type as Sophie; what attracts her to Eisenheim is not his looks or fortune, but his sway over the mysteries of the world. She's captivated by his gifts, and Biel, a superficial actor until now, holds her own with the intimidating, enigmatic Norton.And finally, there is Leopold. Sewell is a magnificent Sunday ham,  marrying unbridled evil with anguished martyrdom - ""I've done everything I can! Too much!"" -  to create one of those pathetic ego monsters that echoes Peter Sellers and Christopher Walken.

These four actors are the high points of a movie that is also well served by its visual style, a fun paean to the grainy silent movies of yore.  A solid movie to be sure, but not one that stays with you long after the movie is over.""The Illusionist"" tells the love story of Eisenheim the Illusionist (Norton) and Sophie (Biel).  Eisenheim wasn't born an illusionist, of course - he was the child of the cabinet maker who made furniture for the nobility, including Sophie's family.  But kids don't understand the caste system, and the two kids become childhood sweethearts until the adults discover their secret and break them asunder - Sophie is destined to marry a great lord.Eisenheim departs to wander the earth, and he comes back to Vienna 15 years later as one of the most famous illusionists in Europe.  His act thrills the Viennese public, including Inspector Uhl (Giamatti, perfect as always), who is also an amateur prestidigitator.  Uhl convinces his lord, the Crown Prince (Sewell, looking shockingly like Jude Law) to attend a show.  The Crown Prince does so, and brings his (reluctant) fiance, who just happens to be Sophie.  And thus are Sophie and Eisenheim reunited, and they learn that old flames still smolder.What follows is a romantic struggle where Eisenheim and Sophie try to break free from the Crown Prince, who is one of those classic movie villains who insists on marrying the heroine even though she will have nothing to do with him.  Sewell plays his part well, but unfortunately the Crown Prince comes off as little more than a spoiled brat and doesn't really rise to the level of a great foil for Eisenheim.Another unfortunate aspect of any movie featuring magicians is that the real magicians are already working in Hollywood special effects.  So while Eisenheim's audience may be dazzled as Eisenheim makes an orange tree grow on stage, or have two butterflies carry a handkerchief, or even conjure up shades of the dead, these scenes just aren't that thrilling to the movie audience.  After all, we've seen Titanic sink, Barad-Dur fall, King Kong knock down airplanes, and Anthony Michael Hall kiss Uma Thurman - we've seen plenty of miracles already.  Norton does a great job as Eisenheim, but it's difficult not to be reminded that we're merely watching special effects and not a real magician.The love story between Eisenheim and Sophie is touching, but does not reach the heights of a great Hollywood love story by any means.  The Viennese are definitely not the most passionate people in Europe - it's clear why Shakespeare set ""Romeo and Juliet"" in Italy rather than its chilly neighbor to the north.All in all, ""The Illusionist"" is a good, solid movie.  If this review comes across as a bit negative, that is only because I had so many people tell me that I ""just had"" to watch this movie.

In contradiction to whatever it was that set my expectations low, I will set yours relatively high.The Illusionist was thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. And it's basically a 4-person show by Edward Norton (Eisenheim the Illusionist), Paul Giamatti (Inspector Uhl), Jessica Biel (Sophie) and Rufus Sewell (The Crown Prince); All 4 giving real A-list performances.Perhaps my low expectations were because The Illusionist was released right around the same time as Christopher Nolan's The Prestige, and I therefore at the time had a case of Magician-Movie-Overload. Regardless, I'm glad I opted to spend the time with The Illusionist during its first week on DVD. It was so good that, after viewing it on the way home from a business trip, I watched a second showing at home with my wife.My wife liked the movie as much as I did, and that's saying a lot based on her usual ""where do you find these movies"" comment after watching one of my DVD picks.The Illusionist is part Romeo and Juliet period drama based in turn of the century (no not the last one, the one before) Vienna.  It's part psychological drama...a kind of whodunit with a clever, but somewhat predictable twist. And the Illusionist is part magic show.A lot of the tricks in The Illusionist are movie magic...in fact most are movie magic and could only be done as so. Don't expect to go into this movie and be truly amazed by wizardry. But the tricks are a very fun part of the movie, and I believe the intention was to deliberately raise the question of how tales of necromancy could have been inspired. The answer? Mass hypnotism (purely my own speculation of the movie's intent).My recommendation is to see for yourself.",4,The Necromancer,1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,1817,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'expectations', 'Illusionist', 'were', 'set', 'average', 'movie', 'Must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'something', 'read', 'contradiction', 'whatever', 'was', 'set', 'expectations', 'low', 'will', 'set', 'yours', 'relatively', 'high.The', 'Illusionist', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'start', 'finish', 'basically', '4-person', 'show', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Eisenheim', 'Illusionist', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Sophie', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Crown', 'Prince', '4', 'giving', 'real', 'A-list', 'performances.Perhaps', 'low', 'expectations', 'were', 'Illusionist', 'was', 'released', 'right', 'same', 'time', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Prestige', 'therefore', 'time', 'had', 'case', 'Magician-Movie-Overload', 'Regardless', ""'m"", 'glad', 'opted', 'spend', 'time', 'Illusionist', 'first', 'week', 'DVD', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'viewing', 'way', 'home', 'business', 'trip', 'watched', 'second', 'showing', 'home', 'wife.My', 'wife', 'liked', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'saying', 'lot', 'based', 'usual', 'where', 'do', 'find', 'movies', 'comment', 'watching', 'one', 'DVD', 'picks.The', 'Illusionist', 'part', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'period', 'drama', 'based', 'turn', 'century', 'not', 'last', 'one', 'one', 'before', 'Vienna', 'part', 'psychological', 'drama', 'kind', 'whodunit', 'clever', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'twist', 'Illusionist', 'part', 'magic', 'show.A', 'lot', 'tricks', 'Illusionist', 'are', 'movie', 'magic', 'fact', 'most', 'are', 'movie', 'magic', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'done', 'so', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'go', 'movie', 'be', 'truly', 'amazed', 'wizardry', 'tricks', 'are', 'very', 'fun', 'part', 'movie', 'believe', 'intention', 'was', 'deliberately', 'raise', 'question', 'how', 'tales', 'necromancy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'inspired', 'answer', 'Mass', 'hypnotism', 'purely', 'own', 'speculation', 'movie', 'intent', '.My', 'recommendation', 'see']",N/A

1032505,A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L,B000K7VHPU,Solid Snake,"[3, 4]","For the first half of The Illusionist I sat spellbound, swept up in a beautifully realized world of magic and intrigue.  The film's style calls to mind the Albumen prints of the 19th century, with their soft edges and muted sepia tones. It lends the film, which is set in the waning years of the Austro-Hungarian empire, a sense of time and place as well as an atmosphere of mystery. The scenery and costumes certainly convey period authenticity. Old Vienna, with its cobblestone streets and narrow alleyways, grand theaters and resplendent mansions, really comes alive.Even the picturesque quality of the film could not distract me from the glaring flaws in the story. The Illusionist turns on one pivotal event and resolves with a 'twist ending' that turns this pivotal event on its head. This is not a bad thing in and of itself, but the execution, as well as the twist itself, is sub par.Strangely enough, the ending made me despise the character(s) I should have been rooting for, and pity the character(s) who had been served up as villains.The acting, for the most part, is excellent. Norton and Giamatti (who plays an ambitious and principled police detective) deliver good performances. Rufus Sewell steals scenes as the arrogant and conflicted Crown Prince Leopold. Biel's performance doesn't disappoint either, although she is badly miscast as a down-to-earth princess as well as Norton's love interest. She's nice to look at, especially in the bosom enhancing dresses they have her wear, and that was probably intended to be her primary function anyway.Despite its flaws, The Illusionist is a captivating film, at least the first time around. More critical viewers will have no trouble seeing through the pretty packaging on subsequent viewings, so the film will depreciate rapidly.

1032507,A17QWJEEELWETQ,B000K7VHPU,spiders-n-vinegaroons,"[5, 10]","SPOILERS BELOW...In The Illusionist we are presented with ""Eisenheim"" the Illusionist and his great magic show.  However, there's no real trickery in his show, just illusion as he clearly points out in a defining moment of the film.  He has come a long way since his childhood and is now an elite member of society you could say.  People flock to his show, and he even gets the attention of the crown prince of Vienna, Prince Leopold.  To say his showmanship goes unnoticed would be to say something to the effect that the sun never shines.  Clearly not true as he seems to sell out every show and it clearly becomes a standing room only event.The problem I had with this movie was the storyline or lack there of it.  The plot is simple, Eisenheim loses a childhood love, and then encounters her once again years later.  He's now a famed magician and will do anything in his power to get her back for good this time around.  Some people get in his way, but in the end he fools everyone and moves away with his long lost love.  But here's the problem, the seperation between him and Sophie was not tragic at all.  Something I think this film needed so that we could better understand Eisenheim's motivation.  Her parents forbaded her from seeing Eisenheim ever again and he eventually moved away and became the man he is at the present day.  The movie only shows them together for a few moments and while I don't question the authenticity of the childhood love or crush, I question the fact that there was not enough substance about the relationship in the film to go along with the plot.  As a member of the audience, I found it hard to believe that after all those years, he still longed for her and had not really ""moved on"".  Again, I don't question the fact that he possibly loved her so that he couldn't get his heart away from her, but the film doesn't show any of that.  I think this is a critical mistake by the director.  Sophie doesn't help this point either when she agrees to flee with Eisenheim before putting any real thought into what she was about to do.  So we're supposed to believe that after all these years, their love is still strong and that she will leave her whole life behind to run away with him?  Believable?  Maybe, maybe not.The movie is split into 3 main parts that don't fully describe Eisenheim's life so that we may better understand who he is.1.  He's a boy and he falls in love.2.  He becomes a famed magician after a chance encounter with another magician who may be real or may not be real.3.  He finds his long lost love and comes up with some unreal illusion to fool everyone so that he may run away with her.I was scratching my head and trying to understand what he was really trying to do by performing his ""spirit"" illusion trick.Again, the gaps in this film do little to describe Eisenheim and do little to provide what was behind his motivation to do the things he does in this film.I was fortunate enough to see the movie The Prestige before I saw this one.  I was blown away by it, and I knew what to expect when going in to watch this one.  The final issue I had with the film was the actual ""trick"" itself or lack thereof.  If you think about it, the only way the trick would have worked (as presented by the film) was if the prince was somehow out of the picture.  But to have him commit suicide?  I don't get it.  At the end the viewer is made aware that the ""trick"" was actually a well-planned set up by both Sophie and Eisenheim.  Therefore, I don't understand why the Prince, knowing he's actually innocent and knowing Giamatti's character could be silenced easily, would shoot himself.  He's a prince.  His father would have easily taken his word over the chief inspector's.So....The prestige in this film is that Sophie was eventually brought back and was reunited with Eisenheim.  Great.  However, as in the movie The Prestige, the audience is shown how everything came to be.  What about the illusion trick?  How did he do it?  Did he actually posess mystical powers?  No one knows.  I think the movie left both audiences hanging.  The audience portrayed in the movie, and the audience who have seen this movie in the theater and can now watch it on DVD.",2,No real trick here,1171411200,"02 14, 2007",2007,4212,"['SPOILERS', 'BELOW', 'Illusionist', 'are', 'presented', 'Eisenheim', 'Illusionist', 'great', 'magic', 'show', 'However', 'real', 'trickery', 'show', 'just', 'illusion', 'clearly', 'out', 'defining', 'moment', 'film', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'childhood', 'now', 'elite', 'member', 'society', 'could', 'say', 'People', 'flock', 'show', 'even', 'attention', 'crown', 'prince', 'Vienna', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'say', 'showmanship', 'unnoticed', 'would', 'be', 'say', 'something', 'effect', 'sun', 'never', 'shines', 'Clearly', 'not', 'true', 'sell', 'out', 'show', 'clearly', 'standing', 'room', 'only', 'event.The', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'storyline', 'lack', 'there', 'plot', 'simple', 'Eisenheim', 'childhood', 'love', 'then', 'once', 'again', 'years', 'later', 'now', 'famed', 'magician', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'power', 'get', 'back', 'good', 'time', 'around', 'people', 'get', 'way', 'end', 'everyone', 'away', 'long', 'lost', 'love', 'here', 'problem', 'seperation', 'Sophie', 'was', 'not', 'tragic', 'Something', 'think', 'film', 'needed', 'so', 'could', 'better', 'understand', 'Eisenheim', 'motivation', 'parents', 'forbaded', 'seeing', 'Eisenheim', 'ever', 'again', 'eventually', 'moved', 'away', 'became', 'man', 'present', 'day', 'movie', 'only', 'together', 'few', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'question', 'authenticity', 'childhood', 'love', 'crush', 'question', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'substance', 'relationship', 'film', 'go', 'along', 'plot', 'member', 'audience', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', 'years', 'still', 'longed', 'had', 'not', 'really', 'moved', 'Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'question', 'fact', 'possibly', 'loved', 'so', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'heart', 'away', 'film', ""n't"", 'show', 'think', 'critical', 'mistake', 'director', 'Sophie', ""n't"", 'help', 'point', 'when', 'flee', 'Eisenheim', 'putting', 'real', 'thought', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'do', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'years', 'love', 'still', 'strong', 'will', 'leave', 'whole', 'life', 'run', 'away', 'Believable', 'Maybe', 'maybe', 'not.The', 'movie', 'split', '3', 'main', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'fully', 'describe', 'Eisenheim', 'life', 'so', 'may', 'better', 'understand', 'who', 'is.1', 'boy', 'love.2', 'famed', 'magician', 'chance', 'encounter', 'magician', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'real', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'real.3', 'long', 'lost', 'love', 'up', 'unreal', 'illusion', 'fool', 'everyone', 'so', 'may', 'run', 'away', 'her.I', 'was', 'scratching', 'head', 'trying', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'trying', 'do', 'performing', 'spirit', 'illusion', 'trick.Again', 'gaps', 'film', 'do', 'little', 'describe', 'Eisenheim', 'do', 'little', 'provide', 'what', 'was', 'motivation', 'do', 'things', 'film.I', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'movie', 'Prestige', 'saw', 'one', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'going', 'watch', 'one', 'final', 'issue', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'actual', 'trick', 'lack', 'thereof', 'think', 'only', 'way', 'trick', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'presented', 'film', 'was', 'prince', 'was', 'somehow', 'picture', 'have', 'commit', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'end', 'viewer', 'made', 'aware', 'trick', 'was', 'actually', 'well-planned', 'set', 'up', 'Sophie', 'Eisenheim', 'Therefore', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Prince', 'knowing', 'actually', 'innocent', 'knowing', 'Giamatti', 'character', 'could', 'be', 'silenced', 'easily', 'would', 'shoot', 'prince', 'father', 'would', 'have', 'easily', 'taken', 'word', 'chief', ""inspector's.So"", 'prestige', 'film', 'Sophie', 'was', 'eventually', 'brought', 'back', 'was', 'reunited', 'Eisenheim', 'Great', 'However', 'movie', 'Prestige', 'audience', 'shown', 'how', 'everything', 'came', 'be', 'What', 'illusion', 'trick', 'How', 'did', 'do', 'Did', 'actually', 'posess', 'mystical', 'powers', 'one', 'think', 'movie', 'left', 'audiences', 'hanging', 'audience', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'audience', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'theater', 'can', 'now', 'watch', 'DVD']",N/A

She doesn't appear to be aging gracefully. Though she's Austrian her accent doesn't sound German. It doesn't sound like it's anything at all. It's the typical American acting approach to doing a foreign accent -- make it vaguely exotic and use soft R's. Still, our expectations of her as an actress aren't high to begin with.Which leads us to Norton. His wandering accent is so distracting that it detracts from the movie. It's right up there with Kevin Costner's in ""Robin Hood,"" and that's not a comparison you want as an actor. He projects a compelling intensity when he's performing, but when he speaks he's just another American in a pretty costume. With this, Down in the Valley, Red Dragon, and so on, he's tarnishing his reputation as one of the best actors of his generation. His best work in recent memory was his uncredited performance as the leper king in Kingdom of Heaven, in which he performed in a metal mask!The actor we should be talking about is Rufus Sewell, who steals every scene he's in.

Leopold hires Police Cheif Uhl, played to perfection by Giamatti, to pursue Eisenheim and destroy his legacy.The film is filled with stunning visual effects, as well as many plot twists and surprises along the way.The best thing about the film, however, is the performance of the entire cast, particularly Norton and Giamatti who could easily recieve Oscar nods.RecommendedB+",4,"""Everything you have seen here has been an illusion""",1168732800,"01 14, 2007",2007,899,"['Illusionist', 'fascinating', 'film', 'directed', 'Neil', 'Burger', 'Interview', 'Assassin', 'starring', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Jessica', 'Biehl', 'Stealth', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Sideways', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Tristan', '+', 'Isolde', '.Norton', 'magician', 'Eisenheim', '19th', 'century', 'Vienna', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'played', 'Sewell', 'offended', 'Eisenheim', 'sudden', 'appeal', 'masses', 'particularly', 'wife', 'be', 'Sophie', 'played', 'Biehl', 'who', 'be', 'Eisenheim', 'childhood', 'darling', 'current', 'love', 'interest', 'Leopold', 'Police', 'Cheif', 'Uhl', 'played', 'perfection', 'Giamatti', 'pursue', 'Eisenheim', 'destroy', 'legacy.The', 'film', 'filled', 'stunning', 'visual', 'effects', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'plot', 'twists', 'surprises', 'way.The', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'however', 'performance', 'entire', 'cast', 'particularly', 'Norton', 'Giamatti', 'who', 'could', 'easily', 'recieve', 'Oscar', 'nods.RecommendedB+']",N/A

I didn't see it in theaters (though I regretted not after hearing his praise) so I was eager to rent it when it arrived on DVD. It did sooner than expected and I rented it a week after it made it's premiere on the shelves. First off, let me start by saying my cousin isn't going to be very fond of my review. But I will continue. The movie is shown in flashbacks and opens with Eisenheim the Illusionist, a traveling magician, being arrested. We see the movie as it goes through different time periods, from when Eisenheim was a young boy to him grown up as a traveling magician. He is instantly famed for doing tricks absolutely no one can figure out. But, as Eisenheim says so himself, everything is an illusion. One very good thing about this film was the cinematography. The colors used and camera angles were all very, very, very well done especially the mysteriously filmed sex scene. The storyline was interesting enough, and the acting was very good, but what I found about this film was that is was tedious. I had to fight myself to keep awake during a few select scenes (maybe it was because I started it at 10:30 at night but I'm not sure) and that a lot of it was redundant. I can definitely see why others really like this film but it didn't strike me as something that I would watch over and over again.

I suppose at this point in the wake of movies like The Usual Suspects, The 6th Sense, Fight Club, etc., our eyes and ears have been trained to catch the supposed ""twist ending"" before it happens.The Illusionist is based on a short novel by Steven Millhauser which Neil Burger carelessly adapted into a much longer than nesessary film.  It's painfully obvious that there is not enough material to fill an entire movie here so a lot of the scenes felt pointless and bogged down by lack of story.  First and foremost, The Illusionist is a love story.  Magic is just a secondary offering (for more magic and less love, see The Prestiege, but don't be surprised if you predict the ending).  Eisenheim and Sophie are childhood friends who fall in love, but he is a commoner and she has high stature so her family won't allow her to even be seen with him.  Skip ahead in time and Sophie is set to marry a crown prince while Eisenheim is a well regarged magician.The performances were all good, but not enough to save the material.  I always enjoy Ed Norton (Death To Smoochy being the exception).  Paul Giamatti surprised me as the inspector, because he left his mopey, sad sack image behind and actually played a character I had yet to see him play.  Jessica Biel was fine for what it was worth, and Rufus Sewell was good because I hated his unlikable character.Without giving too much away, the downfall of the movie comes when a supposed accident occurs and then Eisenheim begins performing the same trick over and over again for about 5 minutes at a time and then walks off stage.  I guess you had to be there because the audience members seemed to be amazed but I was waiting for something new to happen.  The movie then slowly drags its feet to the twist ending which felt like it was trying to be The Usual Suspects so hard, that it actually made me want to turn it off.Let's see if I can at least end this on a positive note.  The cinematography was really good.  Congratulations to Dick Pope.",2,Where's the magic?

As Inspector Uhl, an amateur conjurer who idolizes the magician whose career he has been ordered to destroy, he nearly steals the picture, but aside from a few minor quibbles, it has been so cleverly written and directed by Neil Burger, and is full of so many good performances, that this doesn't quite happen.As Eisenheim, the Illusionist, Edward Norton gives a wonderful performance, but he's saddled with the only scenes in the picture that don't work:  the love scenes, which, curiously, are shot almost entirely in close-up, so that no chemistry ever develops between him and the woman who is supposedly the love of his life.  At times, one gets the impression that he and his leading lady filmed their scenes without actually being together in the same room.  As that woman, Jessica Biel is pretty & looks well in her bodices and petticoats, but her character is very nearly a cipher. As the half-mad Crown Prince Leopold, Rufus Sewell gives a broad, roaring performance in the old tradition of Hollywood villains from the Golden Age.  He's a combination of Basil Rathbone and Conrad Veidt -- and immensely entertaining every moment he's on screen.Filmed on location in and around Prague, ""The Illusionist""  looks gorgeous:  the production design of is one of its greatest assets.As is his wont, Philip Glass lets his music burble away murkily without ever arriving at -- or even approaching -- a climax (orchestral blue-balls, I call it); on the other hand, the endless repetitiveness of his strings produces a nice sense of menace, ennui and claustrophobia entirely appropriate to the story it underscores.All in all, a thoroughly entertaining and haunting picture that stands up admirably on repeated viewings.

This is one movie that will make you question just what is really a trick, and what has happened in the story itself.The Illusionist tells the story about a young man simply named Eisenheim [Edward Norton] who leaves audiences of his shows in total amazement and awe at his spellbinding tricks and illusions in many shows in Vienna. His shows are so well acclaimed that he sparks the interest of the crown prince, Leopold [Rufus Sewell] and his fiance. [Jessica Biel]At first the crown prince believes that Eisenhiem is no threat, but after his fiance and Eisenheim realize that they were once childhood friends [maybe even more] Leopold believes his marriage is in danger. Paul Giamatti costars as the city's chief inspector who at first believes Eisenheim is a great magician who is there just to entertain, but starts to question his own judgement on the magician, especially after a terrible crime is committed and he has to judge between what the facts are and what he truly believes is the truth.This is a dark film through most of the 109 minutes of this film, in more ways than one. Not only do the characters talk in hushed and toned down voices through most of this movie, but a lot of the magic acts take place in a darkly lit theater, with candlelight and hushed voices adding to the dramatic effect of one of Eisenheim's acts. There are also a few clues to the past of Eisenheim as a boy, which are just as interesting and curious as one of his fantastic acts, such as how he really became a magician in the first place.As for the ending, I will not give it away, but I will say I was absolutely caught off guard with how it ended. Perhaps you will be able to see what I did not, but maybe thats because i absolutely suck at predicting endings of movies, its a big weakness for me!There are also a couple of reviews below mine that rip into this movie and how the characters cannot act with one another...I disagree with that 100%. Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti are great as always, I dont think there is anyone who can deny Norton as a great actor [just look at Fight Club and American History X] as for Paul Giamatti, Cinderella Man anyone? Jessica Biel also passes with her performance, and Leopold was good too, although I found his outbursts of anger a little laughable [just my opinion]Extras on this DVD include:Feature Audio Commentary by the director Neil BurgerThe Making of the Illusionistand a segment with Jessica Biel who talks about the movie herself.This is a great movie to see at least once, it has drama, even humor, a great cast of actors and actresses, and an ending that will show you as it says on the DVD cover...Nothing is what it seems.",5,"Brilliant movie, wonderful ending!",1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,2805,"['must', 'admit', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'watched', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'what', 'saw', 'one', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'question', 'just', 'what', 'really', 'trick', 'happened', 'story', 'itself.The', 'Illusionist', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'simply', 'named', 'Eisenheim', '[', 'Edward', 'Norton', ']', 'who', 'audiences', 'shows', 'total', 'amazement', 'awe', 'spellbinding', 'tricks', 'illusions', 'many', 'shows', 'Vienna', 'shows', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'acclaimed', 'interest', 'crown', 'prince', 'Leopold', '[', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', ']', 'fiance', 'Jessica', 'Biel', ']', 'first', 'crown', 'prince', 'Eisenhiem', 'threat', 'fiance', 'Eisenheim', 'realize', 'were', 'once', 'childhood', 'friends', '[', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', ']', 'Leopold', 'marriage', 'danger', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'city', 'chief', 'inspector', 'who', 'first', 'Eisenheim', 'great', 'magician', 'who', 'there', 'just', 'entertain', 'question', 'own', 'judgement', 'magician', 'especially', 'terrible', 'crime', 'committed', 'judge', 'what', 'facts', 'are', 'what', 'truly', 'truth.This', 'dark', 'film', 'most', '109', 'minutes', 'film', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'characters', 'talk', 'hushed', 'toned', 'down', 'voices', 'most', 'movie', 'lot', 'magic', 'acts', 'take', 'place', 'darkly', 'lit', 'theater', 'candlelight', 'hushed', 'voices', 'adding', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'one', 'Eisenheim', 'acts', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'clues', 'past', 'Eisenheim', 'boy', 'are', 'just', 'interesting', 'curious', 'one', 'fantastic', 'acts', 'such', 'how', 'really', 'became', 'magician', 'first', 'place.As', 'ending', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'absolutely', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'how', 'ended', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'what', 'did', 'not', 'maybe', 'thats', 'i', 'absolutely', 'suck', 'predicting', 'endings', 'movies', 'big', 'weakness', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'reviews', 'mine', 'movie', 'how', 'characters', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'one', 'disagree', '100', '%', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'are', 'great', 'always', 'dont', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'deny', 'Norton', 'great', 'actor', '[', 'just', 'look', 'Fight', 'Club', 'American', 'History', 'X', ']', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Cinderella', 'Man', 'anyone', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'also', 'performance', 'Leopold', 'was', 'good', 'too', 'found', 'outbursts', 'anger', 'little', 'laughable', '[', 'just', 'opinion', ']', 'Extras', 'DVD', 'include', 'Feature', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'director', 'Neil', 'BurgerThe', 'Making', 'Illusionistand', 'segment', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'who', 'movie', 'herself.This', 'great', 'movie', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'drama', 'even', 'humor', 'great', 'cast', 'actors', 'actresses', 'ending', 'will', 'show', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Nothing', 'what']",N/A

1032529,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000K7VHPU,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 5]","I avoided ""The Illusionist"" for a long time. I like Edward Norton, I think Paul Giamatti is great, but how can anyone take any film with Jessica Biel playing a 19th Century Viennese Countess seriously? This is such a calculated move on everyone's part, it turned me off. The filmmakers were obviously looking for a pretty actress, with some name recognition, that they could afford. Biel was obviously looking for a film that would show ""I'm a serious actress"". Then, the reviews for Norton were lukewarm, so I had even more reason to stay away.During a family visit, the only film I hadn't seen that my mom and step dad would see was ""The Illusionist"". While Norton is rather lackluster and Biel doesn't fit, the film has a very stylized look making it worth a look as a bargain matinee or on DVD.Eisenheim (Norton), a magician, makes a triumphant return to Vienna, his hometown, after touring the world and earning a reputation for himself. He mesmerizes the audience with his illusions, including Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti). Soon, Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) hears of the magician and attends the performance with his fianc&eacute;e, Sophie (Biel). Asking for a volunteer, Eisenheim brings Sophie on stage and performs a trick. Later, he reminds her that they were once friends, as children. Eisenheim learns Sophie is unhappy and doesn't want to marry the Crown Prince, a man with a questionable past and a history of violence towards women. But what can Eisenheim do to correct the situation?Written and directed by Neil Burger, ""The Illusionist"", based on a short story by Steven Millhauser, is an interesting film to watch. Sepia tones flood every frame, given it the appearance of the old daguerreotypes. Throughout, Burger uses a number of old fashioned editing techniques, giving the film the appearance of an old silent film. Both of these elements, and the settings, combine to make for an almost lovely film.But then he has to deal with the actors and he is less successful on that front. Edward Norton has done some great work in his previous films, but As Eisenheim he seems almost lifeless. There are brief moments when he shows conflict, or emotion, but these are few and far between. From an actor with the talent of Norton, this is a disappointment. Norton is one of those actors who used to show so much promise, people called him the next Brando or Lancaster, but he hasn't shown that type of range or skill since ""The Italian Job"", a film he was forced to participate in because of a contractual obligation. If you want to go back to his last intense role that would probably have to be ""American History X"".Biel is, if anything, acceptable. But I can't help but imagine what an actress with the skill of Julianne Moore or Laura Linney might have done with the role. Yes, they are each too old, but their talent would have transformed this character. As it is, Biel is required to do little than stand around and look wistful. Thankfully, she doesn't try to do much of an accent. I get the feeling that would have transformed the film into high camp.Paul Giamatti is interesting as Chief Inspector Uhl, a man who initially welcomes the performances of Eisenheim, but when the Crown Prince recognizes the danger of the magician, quickly turns against the illusionist. Uhl is under the control of the Crown Prince and must do what he wants. Throughout, Giamatti manages to convey the characters conflict of emotions and feelings. But during the last few minutes, as Giamatti realizes the games that have been perpetuated upon him, he stares to the heavens as the camera circles him. As realization dawns, he claps, once. Leaving the theater, I remarked that he thankfully kept the clapping to a minimum. The one clap is corny enough, but to have the clapping continue and have Uhl remark ""Bravo!"", well, once again, we are approaching high camp.""The Illusionist"" is an interesting film for the visuals, and this makes it worth a look at bargain matinee prices. Or perhaps on DVD. I doubt you will find little of interest in the actor's performances.",3,"2 1/2 - Pretty to look at, but the performances are less than stellar",1159142400,"09 25, 2006",2006,4081,"['avoided', 'Illusionist', 'long', 'time', 'like', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'think', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'great', 'how', 'can', 'anyone', 'take', 'film', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'playing', '19th', 'Century', 'Viennese', 'Countess', 'seriously', 'such', 'calculated', 'move', 'everyone', 'part', 'turned', 'off', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'obviously', 'looking', 'pretty', 'actress', 'name', 'recognition', 'could', 'afford', 'Biel', 'was', 'obviously', 'looking', 'film', 'would', 'show', ""'m"", 'serious', 'actress', 'Then', 'reviews', 'Norton', 'were', 'lukewarm', 'had', 'even', 'more', 'reason', 'stay', 'away.During', 'family', 'visit', 'only', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'mom', 'step', 'dad', 'would', 'see', 'was', 'Illusionist', 'Norton', 'rather', 'lackluster', 'Biel', ""n't"", 'fit', 'film', 'very', 'stylized', 'look', 'making', 'look', 'bargain', 'matinee', 'DVD.Eisenheim', 'Norton', 'magician', 'triumphant', 'return', 'Vienna', 'hometown', 'touring', 'world', 'earning', 'reputation', 'audience', 'illusions', 'including', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'Giamatti', 'Soon', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'hears', 'magician', 'performance', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Sophie', 'Biel', 'Asking', 'volunteer', 'Eisenheim', 'Sophie', 'stage', 'trick', 'Later', 'were', 'once', 'friends', 'children', 'Eisenheim', 'Sophie', 'unhappy', ""n't"", 'want', 'marry', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'man', 'questionable', 'past', 'history', 'violence', 'towards', 'women', 'what', 'can', 'Eisenheim', 'do', 'correct', 'situation', 'Written', 'directed', 'Neil', 'Burger', 'Illusionist', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Steven', 'Millhauser', 'interesting', 'film', 'watch', 'Sepia', 'tones', 'flood', 'frame', 'given', 'appearance', 'old', 'daguerreotypes', 'Throughout', 'Burger', 'number', 'old', 'fashioned', 'editing', 'techniques', 'giving', 'film', 'appearance', 'old', 'silent', 'film', 'elements', 'settings', 'combine', 'make', 'almost', 'lovely', 'film.But', 'then', 'deal', 'actors', 'less', 'successful', 'front', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'done', 'great', 'work', 'previous', 'films', 'Eisenheim', 'almost', 'lifeless', 'are', 'brief', 'moments', 'when', 'conflict', 'emotion', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'actor', 'talent', 'Norton', 'disappointment', 'Norton', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'used', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'promise', 'people', 'called', 'next', 'Brando', 'Lancaster', ""n't"", 'shown', 'type', 'range', 'skill', 'Italian', 'Job', 'film', 'was', 'forced', 'participate', 'contractual', 'obligation', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'last', 'intense', 'role', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'be', 'American', 'History', 'X', '.Biel', 'anything', 'acceptable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'imagine', 'what', 'actress', 'skill', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'role', 'Yes', 'are', 'too', 'old', 'talent', 'would', 'have', 'transformed', 'character', 'Biel', 'required', 'do', 'little', 'stand', 'look', 'wistful', 'Thankfully', ""n't"", 'try', 'do', 'much', 'accent', 'get', 'feeling', 'would', 'have', 'transformed', 'film', 'high', 'camp.Paul', 'Giamatti', 'interesting', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'man', 'who', 'initially', 'performances', 'Eisenheim', 'when', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'danger', 'magician', 'quickly', 'illusionist', 'Uhl', 'control', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'must', 'do', 'what', 'Throughout', 'Giamatti', 'convey', 'characters', 'conflict', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'Giamatti', 'games', 'have', 'been', 'perpetuated', 'heavens', 'camera', 'realization', 'dawns', 'once', 'Leaving', 'theater', 'remarked', 'thankfully', 'kept', 'clapping', 'minimum', 'one', 'clap', 'corny', 'enough', 'have', 'clapping', 'continue', 'have', 'Uhl', 'remark', 'Bravo', 'well', 'once', 'again', 'are', 'approaching', 'high', 'camp', 'Illusionist', 'interesting', 'film', 'visuals', 'look', 'bargain', 'matinee', 'prices', 'perhaps', 'DVD', 'doubt', 'will', 'find', 'little', 'interest', 'actor', 'performances']",N/A

1032531,ALG7QH2L5JL2L,B000K7VHPU,"T. Noever ""Author of the TETHYS series""","[5, 6]","Even though it is already out on DVD, I'm glad I saw it on a proper cinema screen. No doubt I'll get the DVD, but it's one of those flicks you'd want to see at 'the movies' at least once.Warning: SPOILERS FOLLOW, but nothing that gives the plot away too much.It's difficult to add to the good things said about this movie, but I'll try, leaving the most important bits till last.About the cinematography. Beautifully done, but not cloyingly so, or in a way that makes it get in the way of the story. After the intro, which is rather long and arty--this isn't a criticism, just an observation--the images become unobtrusive. The way it was done was reminiscent of the way Ridley Scott used images in The Duellists; effectively and many had the quality of paintings, but they always enhanced and never distracted or occasioned that annoying ""what great cinematography"" effect, which usually takes you out of the story for sometimes distractingly long periods.The story. It matters, but the whole effect of the 'surprise' has been overemphasized in most reviews that talk about it. It's not about sudden revelation, but about completion of a carefully spun web is deception. Personally, I wasn't surprised, and I wasn't looking to be surprised. I just loved the way things came together in complete closure--not just Eisenheim's deception, but also the strands of inevitable cosmic justice and a sense of final equipoise and closure. Anybody watching with any amount of sensitivity should see it all coming, and those who don't see it will still sense it. It's all very subtly done; and as such it creeps up on you, and you don't even know consciously that it's there. So, it's not the 'surprise', such as there is, that matters, but the wholeness of it all and the watching of it unfold.The whole 'mystery' thing and its 'supernatural aspects was also been overemphasized in many reviews. There is, to my mind, no suggestion that an interpretation allowing for a life-after-death explication of the whole story was intended. If anybody thinks there is, they should consider themselves a part of those members of Eisenheim's audiences who thought that his tricks were evidence for the survival of the spirit. This is evidenced clearly by a single and unambiguous statement of Eisenheim to Sophie, which was as much a declaration of his love for her as it was a denial of the validity of the 'supernaturalist' or 'spiritualist' interpretation of his tricks and the denouement of the story. Reason why people miss it, is that the context of the statement distracts from its significance with regards to other areas. It's one of the ways in which this movie is very subtle and devious about revealing itself. A truly masterful script.There's a social theme interleaved into all of this, usually described as being a 'class' issue. I would not put it that crassly. It does however have to do with democracy, in the sense of the notion that in some way everybody has a right to be heard, no matter their social standing may be. This again is brought out clearly in the Crown Prince's final soliloquy, when faced with Inspector Uhl's revelations and his imminent fall from grace. Here, too, though, subtlety and focus on character took the place of pat social proselytizing.Romance is the driving force of the movie. Nothing at all would have 'happened', and Eisenheim would never have returned to Vienna, had it not been for Sophie.Eisenheim: I was meant to return. I just... I kept thinking I'll find around the next corner.Sophie: What?Eisenheim: A real mystery. I saw remarkable things but the only mystery I never solved was why my heart couldn't let go of you.Nothing more need to be said about that. The other stuff was just backdrop and devices. The fuel for the fire was love; not some social or spiritual agenda nonsense.In line with the rest of the movie, the one and only love/sex scene between Eisenheim and Sophie was both subtle and yet intense, both in terms of interaction as cinematography; making everything that happened there unabashedly romantic and therefore intensely erotic without requiring over-explicitness. There is an inherent difficulty in movies--and novels--where two characters come together in a love scene, as we know they must in order for things to proceed. (Unless the event is placed at the end as the denouement, but his was not the case here). The characters have to at least confess their love; probably do more and kiss; maybe go beyond that and 'consummate'. The danger of making this whole process almost perfunctory--as in it being necessary, and so it just has to be there; which takes a lot of the zing out of it--is great. And there's always the danger of there either being too little, which leaves the viewer unsatisfied, or too much--especially of explicit sex--which in this context would have been out of character for the tone of the film. There's also the danger of a love-scene just being a sex-scene; a common failing nowadays, in film and novel alike.The Illusionist gave us exactly what was needed. A lead-up which made us expect something of what was about to happen, but nobody quite knew what shape it would take; a coming together after the briefest of recrimination for a past disappointment; a panning away from the act itself with some fairly non-explicit and very creative pans across part of nude human anatomy; and, most importantly, an after-the-fact lingering, not just on the romance, but on how it connected to everything else, past, present and future, disappointments and hopes.  And never in all that was there a moment's doubt that this, and nothing else, was what the movie was all about. Which means we end up actually believing--even if a twitch of ""oh, here it comes"" is there at the start, with maybe a ""are they going to screw this up?""--what these people are doing, and despite the apprehension lurking in some of us, like me, about being taken out of the story because this is another sex-scene, we come out of it realizing that it is in truth a love-scene and one that seamlessly connects to everything else in the story.Lastly, cynics be warned: The Illusionist is at its core a cunningly-disguised feel-good-movie. It doesn't have a cynical bone in its body, even though it doesn't see the world through rose-colored glasses either. But one doesn't have to, and one can still not be a cynic.There will, of course, be cynics who love this movie, though they'll probably strenuously deny that they were captured by its charm, rather than its intellectual messages, arty cinematography, crafty plot--or whatever cynics think they need to put up as good explanations for liking this flick. Sentimentality is unfashionable among the 'educated' and enlightened who know what's real and what isn't. The Illusionist is an excellent antidote to the poison of deluded intellectualism--ironically working its effect by a pretension of appeal to the intellect.",5,"A charming, subtle

This is something I very rarely do and done only with most interesting and haunting of films.This is a great story that blends a fascinating subject matter, romance, clever thinking, interesting, believable characters in a gorgeous storybook setting complete with lighting and scene selection worthy of a master artist.  Not a moment is wasted. No filler. The art direction has a lot to do with it, as each frame is beautiful to behold. But it's the story that keeps one's attention riveted. Excellent acting on all counts. And, of course, the wondrous illusions which Eisenheim so confidently and masterful displays are captivating, especially his most masterful illusion of all which the entire film revolves around, but I don't want to spoil it by giving any details.In a nutshell, The Illusionist is a tale about the triumph of love and true nobility over the fake kind that is passed down in a family lineage. 'Eisenheim'  embodies a truly Noble Spirit and does indeed triumph, but only through the most clever of strategies and after putting everything on the line, including his immense love for the Duchess Sophia, all of his money and possessions as he steps out in faith, stretching his skills of illusion beyond their previous limits.By the end of the film, you even start to like the myopic Police Inspector, who at first appears to be a narrow-minded, self aggrandizing tool of the powers that be, namely - the Crowned Prince. However he eventually displays his own nobility once he is certain of the truth, and even shows fond admiration for his previous adversary's brilliance in single handedly obtaining true justice. And the ultimate fate of the Crowned Prince is as poetic as can be imagined.  It's one of those quirky twists in life that, when they happen, you can only chock up to divine providence, it is so perfect.Like most good films, this one deserves to be watched closely, as there are lots of details that all hold relevance. But that is not hard to do, for who would want to miss a single frame of these gorgeous recreated scenes of Vienna around 1900? That alone is worth the price of admission.

1032534,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B000K7VHPU,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[5, 5]","Movie - 4.5The Illusionist is something of an oddity. Though it may have gotten lost in the shadow of Christopher Nolan's The Prestige and coincidentally center around the same theme of magic, the two really don't share much else in common. Nolan's film is a calculated and theatrically-charged mystery/thriller, while Burger's is more a romantic drama with a big twist at the end. Overall, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised, regardless of the trivial comparative controversy between the two. Several reasons I like this film are because of its cast, simplicity, and of course that big twist ending. Edward Norton plays the role of a regular guy in love with royalty (Jessica Biel) who, despite her being ""socially engaged"" to a very villainous prince (played brilliantly by Rufus Sewell), loves him back just as much. Within these events, Paul Giamatti plays the role of an up and coming candidate for police commissioner under the Prince's new regime, but is ultimately a man caught between the future of his reputation and doing what he feels is right. The simplicity of the narrative lies in its characters, their emotions, and a very fine script to bring it all about. It's apparent the two lovers really feel for each other, that the villain truly is a villain, and that somewhere in-between the one man watching all of this unfold is genuinely conflicted with what he should do. With that being said, the film is quite character-driven and builds upon some very basic emotions to tell its story. As we're introduced to them from the beginning of their relationships as children and up to the present, it makes for a refreshing tale of love, loyalty, and longevity. By film's end, I was nearly disappointed with how things were turning out. But the last 90 seconds literally transforms the movie into, what I thought was, a dazzling and ingenious turn of events that made all 100 minutes prior worth the title's namesake.Video - 4.0The cinematography for this film is something of a unique situation. It's not flashy or bright by any means, but instead uses (or so I hear) a sepia tone lens, which explains the heavy amounts of darkened browns, tans, and deep, deep blacks. Personally, I like how it fits with that particular time period and setting. It doesn't make much for Blu-ray showcasing, but aesthetically speaking, I think it adds a sense of surrealism to the screenplay and overall plot. Colors are there, though not very vibrant at all, and the monochromatic palette is sure to divide videophiles who might be mistaking this for a bad transfer. But rest assured, it's not. As mentioned, black levels are very deep and benefit greatly from the type of photography used. Contrast suffers as a result, obviously, but image detail is still quite good. Sharpness of objects get a little lost in longer shots, but a lot of the film's closeup shots show some serviceable textures and skin hues, particularly in Giamatti's beard and Biel's flushed cheeks. There also don't appear to any signs of Edge Enhancement or DNR. For what the movie is and considering the kind of content it involves, it's certainly good enough, though nothing to write home about compared to other dramas I've seen.Audio - 4.0Much like it's visual presentation, the audio is equally reserved, but accurate enough to warrant some merit. The DTS-HD track for this film very subdued and relies heavily on just two elements: the dialogue and score. Dialogue is very well-enunciated. Taking place in Vienna, I was a little disappointed in some of the linguistic authenticity, being that I didn't believe any one character was actually Austrian, but that's okay. The acting itself and the excellent script sound great through the center channel. I felt as if I was almost watching some kind of stage play, what with the picture framing and audio giving it that ""silent, but understood"" feeling. The score by Philip Glass is fairly low key, but does a wonderful job enhancing the more emotional and plot-driven scenes. What little sound effects there are disperse and direct themselves accordingly, though are very limited to either horse hooves on the ground, the grinding wheels of a carriage, or crowd noise in and outdoors with some decent separation provided amongst the rears, as well as some panning across the front speakers. There's one scene where the Prince is practicing with a shotgun that really wakes you up, but that's about as loud as it gets. LFEs are next to non-existent, as I'm pretty sure I heard my subwoofer go to standby on multiple occasions. Again, it's not going to wow your guests, but it's serviceable enough.Overall - 4.0I was really surprised at how well this movie turned out. It managed to psychologically suck me into its plot from the very start, and then provide me with a great amount of emotional satisfaction in all but 90 seconds at the end. After hearing so much controversy between this and The Prestige, I have to say any and all comparisons are, indeed, unwarranted and needless outside of the one theme they have in common: magic. Other than using magic as a driving force for the plot, they're so thematically different, I urge anyone who hasn't seen both to just not listen to the hype and take each film for face value, as they're both entertaining in their respective rights. With very good A/V quality, though unfortunately no extras worth mentioning, The Illusionist comes recommended on the strength of the storytelling alone.",4,The Illusionist (Blu-ray),1283817600,"09 7,

Edward Norton is utterly convincing as an early 20th century European magician who discovers that his childhood sweetheart is about to marry a cold, brutal heir to the throne.

Rogers,"[4, 5]","The Illusionist, starring Edward Norton, Jessica Biel and Paul Giamatti is one of the most beautifully crafted motion pictures that I've seen in a long time.  The photography, lighting, and set design bring together the look and atmosphere of Vienna at the turn of the century, creating the perfect setting for Eisenheim the Illusionist (played by Norton) to perform his miraculous tricks of magic.  Eisenheim returns to the city of his birth after a fifteen-year absence only to meet the love of his childhood, the Duchess Sophia (played by Biel) at one of his shows.  The love between he and Sophia is still alive, but she's now destined to marry the Crown Prince Leopold (played by Rufus Sewell) in just a few weeks, and Leopold is the type of man who would kill both of them if he knew about their secret passion for each other.  As Eisenheim becomes the talk of Vienna with his outstanding illusions, Leopold quickly learns about the connection between his fianc&eacute; and the mysterious magician through the investigations of Chief Inspector Uhl (played wonderfully by Paul Giamatti).  The Crown Prince becomes firm in his desire not to lose his fianc&eacute; to another man, especially one of low class.  If he can't have her, then no one can.  A tragedy takes place which forces Eisenheim onto a path of what appears to be self-destruction, or is it perhaps the greatest illusion of all as he seeks his personal revenge against Leopold?  This is the question that will have you glued to your seat in avid anticipation.  I was as surprised by the ending as Chief Inspector Uhl appeared to be.  I never saw it coming, which is somewhat unusual for me.  This was due to a well-written script and excellent performances by all the lead actors.  It's been a sincere pleasure to watch both Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti grow as actors over the last twelve years.  When they take on a role, they literally become the characters, and that's what great acting is all about.  They certainly succeeded in this film.  In fact, everything came together perfectly in The Illusionist: the strong direction and magnificent script by Neil Burger, the terrific acting by everyone in the cast, the superb photography and set production, and the great musical score.

Magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton)returns to Vienna after wandering the world learning the tricks of his trade. His magic dazzles people but a former romance with the crown prince of Vienna's (Rufus Sewell)fianc&eacute;e  Sophie (Jessica Biel)threatens to derail his career when Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti in a stunning performance)is charged with arresting him or running him out of the city.Director Neil Burger has created a marvelous period piece with an intriguing romantic thriller at the heart of this film. The beautiful cinematography and Phillip Glass' marvelous score are wonderfully recreated on this sharp looking DVD.Fans expecting a lot of special features will be disappointed by the paltry ones included here. I suspect that there will probably be a special edition down the road, because considering the magic the film produces, there's a lot more tha could be discussed/shown. We get a 9 minute featurette with the cast and crew discussing how enticed they were with the material. There's also an interview with Jessica Biel discussing the film (which is an extension of the interview featured in the making of featurette on the film). The best special feature is the running commentary by director Neil Burger (sadly Giamatti, Norton and Biel are missing from the commentary track). Burger discusses his opinions of the actors (he was surprised and impressed with what Biel brought to her performance and points out the little touches that Norton & Giamatti introduced to their characters to bring added depth)to the magic tricks seen in the film whether they be ""real"" magic or CGI magic. It's an interesting commentary track but I'd watch the film first all the way through as there are spoilers in the commentary track.""The Illusionist"" was a pleasant surprise with its strong performances and deft direction by Neil Burger. I should warn fans of fast paced action thrillers that this film takes its time in unspooling the story but the pacing works for the film.While there are many who insist on comparing ""The Illusionist"" and ""The Prestige"" (the other movie set against the background of magic)the only thing they share in common is a mystery and the magic. In ""The Illusionist"" the magic background is used for a romantic mystery-thriller while ""The Prestige"" uses the same backdrop for a tale of obsession, rivalry and revenge. Beyond that the films have little in common (including the way the stories are told). Comparing the two is like comparing the flavor of an orange and a tangerine--they're both fruit, both citrus but both have their own unique flavor. Sure some people will prefer one to the other but that doesn't mean one is inherently superior to the other--it depends on one's preference.",4,Magical romantic-mystery thriller set in turn-of-the-century Vienna,1168732800,"01 14, 2007",2007,2874,"['Set', 'backdrop', 'turn-of-the-century', 'Vienna', 'Illusionist', 'slight-of-hand', 'story', 'telling', 'visually', 'stunning', 'treat', 'Magician', 'Eisenheim', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Vienna', 'wandering', 'world', 'learning', 'tricks', 'trade', 'magic', 'dazzles', 'people', 'former', 'romance', 'crown', 'prince', 'Vienna', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Sophie', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'derail', 'career', 'when', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'stunning', 'performance', 'charged', 'arresting', 'running', 'city.Director', 'Neil', 'Burger', 'created', 'marvelous', 'period', 'piece', 'intriguing', 'romantic', 'thriller', 'heart', 'film', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Phillip', 'Glass', 'marvelous', 'score', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'recreated', 'sharp', 'looking', 'DVD.Fans', 'expecting', 'lot', 'special', 'features', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'paltry', 'ones', 'included', 'here', 'suspect', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'special', 'edition', 'road', 'considering', 'magic', 'film', 'lot', 'more', 'tha', 'could', 'be', 'discussed/shown', 'get', '9', 'minute', 'featurette', 'cast', 'crew', 'discussing', 'how', 'enticed', 'were', 'material', 'also', 'interview', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'discussing', 'film', 'extension', 'interview', 'featured', 'making', 'featurette', 'film', 'best', 'special', 'feature', 'running', 'commentary', 'director', 'Neil', 'Burger', 'sadly', 'Giamatti', 'Norton', 'Biel', 'are', 'missing', 'commentary', 'track', 'Burger', 'opinions', 'actors', 'was', 'surprised', 'impressed', 'what', 'Biel', 'brought', 'performance', 'points', 'out', 'little', 'touches', 'Norton', 'Giamatti', 'introduced', 'characters', 'bring', 'added', 'depth', 'magic', 'tricks', 'seen', 'film', 'be', 'real', 'magic', 'CGI', 'magic', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'track', ""'d"", 'watch', 'film', 'first', 'way', 'are', 'spoilers', 'commentary', 'track', 'Illusionist', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'strong', 'performances', 'deft', 'direction', 'Neil', 'Burger', 'should', 'warn', 'fans', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'thrillers', 'film', 'time', 'unspooling', 'story', 'pacing', 'film.While', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'insist', 'comparing', 'Illusionist', 'Prestige', 'other', 'movie', 'set', 'background', 'magic', 'only', 'thing', 'share', 'common', 'mystery', 'magic', 'Illusionist', 'magic', 'background', 'used', 'romantic', 'mystery-thriller', 'Prestige', 'same', 'backdrop', 'tale', 'obsession', 'rivalry', 'revenge', 'Beyond', 'films', 'have', 'little', 'common', 'including', 'way', 'stories', 'are', 'told', 'Comparing', 'two', 'comparing', 'flavor', 'orange', 'tangerine', ""'re"", 'fruit', 'citrus', 'have', 'own', 'unique', 'flavor', 'Sure', 'people', 'will', 'prefer', 'one', 'other', ""n't"", 'mean', 'one', 'inherently', 'superior', 'other', 'one', 'preference']",N/A

He becomes fascinated with magic and practices sleight of hand constantly.  This attracts Sophie, a girl his own age of noble birth to him.  Eisenheim is the son of a cabinetmaker, so Sophie is completely out of reach for him.  Still they plan to run off together, but are inevitably forced apart.  So Eisenheim leaves Vienna alone and travels the world.Fifteen years later in the early 20th century, Eisenheim returns as a celebrated magician who's first show so wows the Viennese crowd, that Crown Prince Leopold and his entourage comes to see his show the following night.  Among his group is Sophie who is soon to become engaged to the Crown Prince.  The rest of the story is Eisenheim's struggle with Leopold, and his Chief Inspector Uhl, to regain Sophie's love.This is a beautifully shot dark romance that really captures the spirit of early 20th century Vienna.  The creamy yellow brick buildings, the dark wood furniture, the horse drawn carriages, the wrought iron fences, the starch collars and bowlers for the men and the long gowns and flowery hats for the women, just every detail is paid attention to in this movie, and in the details are a feast for the eyes.  The camera work of the countryside is just as detailed and well done.  Although the movie is shot in color it has the feel of sepia toned black and white, at points blurring out completely at the edges.  This gives the viewer the feeling that he's looking back through time.  It's a really nicely done effect.  The soundtrack is brooding and mysterious and totally fits the mood.A central, although not completely explored theme of the film, is Eisenheim's spiritual challenge to the rational Victorian thought that dominated the age.  Certainly Inspector Uhl was the rational counterpoint to Eisenheim's spiritual tricks.  Eisenheim's illusions were stunning, an orange tree growing from a seed in a matter of minutes, a robed woman whose relection in a mirror was cut down with a sword, and standing Leopold's sword on it's point so that no one could move it.  Uhl and to a lesser extent Leopold were the Victorian rationalists that demanded an explanation.  It is interesting that magician and illusionists were as popular as they were in the age of Victorian Rationalism and the movie could have profitably explored that dichotomy a little better.  It was certainly used well to make a bone of contention among the main characters that really worked to fill them out well.The other thing I gained from this film, is that Vienna under the Hapsburg Emperors was really a police state, every bit as much as the Tsar's Russia or any monarchy of the day was.  Yes, perhaps England was not outwardly as much of a police state as the other two, but Austria certainly was.  Inspector Uhl was part of the Royal familiy's controlling yoke on the population and his motivations were well explored.Really an interesting film on a lot of levels, and I would be remiss if I didn't mention the acting.  I had a very difficult time imagining Edward Norton and Paul Giametti acting in a film set 100 years ago in Vienna, but they both do a spectacular job, especially Giametti.  Jessica Biehl is perfect in her role, as is Rufus Sewell as Crown Prince Leopold.  Just a very good job of acting all around.The only reason I don't give this movie five stars is that it moves a little slow, could have done a little better exploring the conflict between spirituality and rationalism that was central to the story, and had a somewhat disappointing ending.  It is still, however, a beautifully shot and thought provoking film, and certainly worth watching.",4,A Victorian Interlude,1172361600,"02 25, 2007",2007,4008,"['Illusionist', 'quiet', 'film', 'directed', 'Neil', 'Burger', 'short', 'story', 'Steven', 'Millhauser', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Eisenheim', 'illusionist', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Duchess', 'Sophie', 'Paul', 'Giametti', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold.It', 'movie', 'flashback', 'past', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'where', 'Eisenheim', 'young', 'boy', 'magician', 'tree', 'fascinated', 'magic', 'practices', 'sleight', 'hand', 'constantly', 'Sophie', 'girl', 'own', 'age', 'noble', 'birth', 'Eisenheim', 'son', 'cabinetmaker', 'Sophie', 'completely', 'reach', 'Still', 'plan', 'run', 'off', 'together', 'are', 'inevitably', 'forced', 'apart', 'So', 'Eisenheim', 'Vienna', 'alone', 'world.Fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'Eisenheim', 'celebrated', 'magician', 'who', 'first', 'show', 'so', 'Viennese', 'crowd', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'entourage', 'see', 'show', 'following', 'night', 'group', 'Sophie', 'who', 'soon', 'become', 'engaged', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'rest', 'story', 'Eisenheim', 'struggle', 'Leopold', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'regain', 'Sophie', 'love.This', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'dark', 'romance', 'really', 'spirit', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'Vienna', 'creamy', 'yellow', 'brick', 'buildings', 'dark', 'wood', 'furniture', 'horse', 'drawn', 'carriages', 'wrought', 'iron', 'fences', 'starch', 'collars', 'bowlers', 'men', 'long', 'gowns', 'flowery', 'hats', 'women', 'just', 'detail', 'paid', 'attention', 'movie', 'details', 'are', 'feast', 'eyes', 'camera', 'work', 'countryside', 'just', 'as', 'detailed', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'shot', 'color', 'feel', 'sepia', 'toned', 'black', 'white', 'points', 'blurring', 'out', 'completely', 'edges', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'looking', 'back', 'time', 'really', 'nicely', 'done', 'effect', 'soundtrack', 'brooding', 'mysterious', 'totally', 'mood.A', 'central', 'not', 'completely', 'explored', 'theme', 'film', 'Eisenheim', 'spiritual', 'challenge', 'rational', 'Victorian', 'thought', 'dominated', 'age', 'Certainly', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'was', 'rational', 'counterpoint', 'Eisenheim', 'spiritual', 'tricks', 'Eisenheim', 'illusions', 'were', 'stunning', 'orange', 'tree', 'growing', 'seed', 'matter', 'minutes', 'robed', 'woman', 'relection', 'mirror', 'was', 'cut', 'down', 'sword', 'standing', 'Leopold', 'sword', 'point', 'so', 'one', 'could', 'move', 'Uhl', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Leopold', 'were', 'Victorian', 'rationalists', 'demanded', 'explanation', 'interesting', 'magician', 'illusionists', 'were', 'as', 'popular', 'were', 'age', 'Victorian', 'Rationalism', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'profitably', 'explored', 'little', 'better', 'was', 'certainly', 'used', 'well', 'make', 'bone', 'contention', 'main', 'characters', 'really', 'worked', 'fill', 'out', 'other', 'thing', 'gained', 'film', 'Vienna', 'Hapsburg', 'Emperors', 'was', 'really', 'police', 'state', 'bit', 'as', 'much', 'Tsar', 'Russia', 'monarchy', 'day', 'was', 'Yes', 'perhaps', 'England', 'was', 'not', 'outwardly', 'much', 'police', 'state', 'other', 'two', 'Austria', 'certainly', 'was', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'was', 'part', 'Royal', 'familiy', 'controlling', 'yoke', 'population', 'motivations', 'were', 'well', 'explored.Really', 'interesting', 'film', 'lot', 'levels', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'did', ""n't"", 'mention', 'acting', 'had', 'very', 'difficult', 'time', 'imagining', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Paul', 'Giametti', 'acting', 'film', 'set', '100', 'years', 'ago', 'Vienna', 'do', 'spectacular', 'job', 'especially', 'Giametti', 'Jessica', 'Biehl', 'perfect', 'role', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Leopold', 'Just', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'around.The', 'only', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'little', 'slow', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'little', 'better', 'exploring', 'conflict', 'spirituality', 'rationalism', 'was', 'central', 'story', 'had', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'ending', 'still', 'however', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

But it drops a big hint.""The Illusionist"" is a wonderful exercise in the use of CGI and digital processing to create a film with a unique visual style. But as a drama with a surprise ending, it's less than satisfactory.The problem is with dialog that telegraphs the ending. When Eisenheim asks Sophie if she wishes to run away with him, she replies that Leopold will hunt them down and kill them, no matter where they go. Given that they're obviously intelligent people, and they understand exactly how Leopold will react, the ending is all too predictable.The acting and directing are nothing if not exquisite, fully matching the magnificent art direction and scenes of period Vienna. Note how when Inspector Uhl feels the hands of Sophie's corpse to see if she really is dead, the director does nothing to draw our attention to it. He assumes the audience is paying attention, and is intelligent enough not to need having Uhl's actions explained.I suspect the implicit anti-Semitism of Leopold's hatred of Eisenheim (who's Jewish) and the line ""Make us disappear!"" anticipate the anguish of the millions of Jews who would be exterminated 40 years later. But the film doesn't acknowledge or develop these implications.By the way, the orange-tree illusion was created by the French illusionist Robert Houdin, the magician Houdini named himself after.",4,Not that much of an illusion.,1194480000,"11 8, 2007",2007,1400,"['Warning', 'review', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'ending', 'big', 'hint', 'Illusionist', 'wonderful', 'exercise', 'use', 'CGI', 'digital', 'processing', 'create', 'film', 'unique', 'visual', 'style', 'drama', 'surprise', 'ending', 'less', 'satisfactory.The', 'problem', 'dialog', 'ending', 'When', 'Eisenheim', 'Sophie', 'run', 'away', 'Leopold', 'will', 'hunt', 'down', 'kill', 'matter', 'where', 'go', 'Given', ""'re"", 'obviously', 'intelligent', 'people', 'understand', 'exactly', 'how', 'Leopold', 'will', 'react', 'ending', 'too', 'predictable.The', 'acting', 'directing', 'are', 'nothing', 'not', 'exquisite', 'fully', 'matching', 'magnificent', 'art', 'direction', 'scenes', 'period', 'Vienna', 'Note', 'how', 'when', 'Inspector', 'Uhl', 'hands', 'Sophie', 'corpse', 'see', 'really', 'dead', 'director', 'nothing', 'draw', 'attention', 'audience', 'paying', 'attention', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'not', 'need', 'having', 'Uhl', 'actions', 'explained.I', 'suspect', 'implicit', 'anti-Semitism', 'Leopold', 'hatred', 'Eisenheim', 'who', 'Jewish', 'line', 'Make', 'disappear', 'anticipate', 'anguish', 'millions', 'Jews', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'exterminated', '40', 'years', 'later', 'film', ""n't"", 'acknowledge', 'develop', 'implications.By', 'way', 'orange-tree', 'illusion', 'was', 'created', 'French', 'illusionist', 'Robert', 'Houdin', 'magician', 'Houdini', 'named']",N/A

The Illustration also features a scene-stealing Paul Giamati, and it's obvious that he can play a wide range of characters. I didn't think Jessica Biel was right for her part, because not only does she not look convincing in period wardrobe, she was floundering with a fake accent, and her performance is effortlessly upstaged by Norton and Rufus Sewell. This film does have impressive original score and visual efforts. There is good deal of character development for Norton's childhood character(Eisenheim), but nis travelling experince as a magican in his adulthood was not shown. Norton managed to deliver a performance that is fearless, mysterious and sexy. His romantic plot with Biel's character is under-developed, and it didn't really prepare the audience for the eventual surprise Ending. Giamati has a good amount of screentime to work with and his best moments are the solo scenes later in the film.

1032554,AP3B615GM191G,B000K7VHPU,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 3]","When making a ""big reveal"" film, a top-notch director must realize that the ""reveal"" cannot be the entire picture.  One must also include fair doses of character development, believable actions, & compelling drama in order to make us care enough for the reveal to actually mean something.  Sadly, Neil Burger does very little of that within ""The Illusionist"".For a basic plot summary, this period piece centers on stage magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton), who conjures up apparitions that are utterly stupefying.  When Sophie (Jessica Biel), the former love of his life, comes back into the equation, Eisenheim must make the decision once and for all as to whether or not they can carve out a life together despite being from completely different social classes.Despite the fact that ""The Illusionist"" was clearly made with care and a very good intent, it ultimately fails to impress for two specific reasons:1. There really isn't much to get invested in.  The characters are little more than cardboard cutouts (the human element is only ""talked"", not actually ""lived""), while the events transpiring around them are never explained (e.g. Eisenheim's actual tricks).2. There is no ""grit"" to the picture whatsoever.  In Christopher Nolan's masterpiece ""The Prestige"", a similar magic-themed film, the director takes you deep inside the world the characters are living in, pulling no punches along the way.  We see it all...the good and the bad and all the raw emotions that result from it.  In ""The Illusionist"", however, stereotypical ""class differences"" and ""the controlling husband"" are used in place of real emotion.  Those stereotypes may have been true of the era, but in this case they needed to be felt instead of just referenced.Overall, then, I cannot recommend this one to those who like their movies deep and full of character growth, as it is quite superficial all the way around.  Yes, it does have a ""mind-blowing"" reveal, but because it fails in so many areas before that point, it loses all its credibility, so to speak.  I highly recommend ""The Prestige"" as an alternative yet still containing very similar themes.",2,"A ""Big Reveal"" Film From A Director Who Doesn't Get It Right",1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,2130,"['When', 'making', 'big', 'reveal', 'film', 'top-notch', 'director', 'must', 'realize', 'reveal', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'entire', 'picture', 'One', 'must', 'also', 'include', 'fair', 'doses', 'character', 'development', 'believable', 'actions', 'compelling', 'drama', 'order', 'make', 'care', 'enough', 'reveal', 'actually', 'mean', 'something', 'Sadly', 'Neil', 'Burger', 'very', 'little', 'Illusionist', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'period', 'piece', 'centers', 'stage', 'magician', 'Eisenheim', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'who', 'up', 'apparitions', 'are', 'utterly', 'stupefying', 'When', 'Sophie', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'former', 'love', 'life', 'back', 'equation', 'Eisenheim', 'must', 'make', 'decision', 'once', 'not', 'can', 'carve', 'out', 'life', 'together', 'being', 'completely', 'different', 'social', 'classes.Despite', 'fact', 'Illusionist', 'was', 'clearly', 'made', 'care', 'very', 'good', 'intent', 'ultimately', 'impress', 'two', 'specific', 'reasons:1', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'get', 'invested', 'characters', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'human', 'element', 'only', 'talked', 'not', 'actually', 'lived', 'events', 'transpiring', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'e.g', 'Eisenheim', 'actual', 'tricks', '.2', 'grit', 'picture', 'whatsoever', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'masterpiece', 'Prestige', 'similar', 'magic-themed', 'film', 'director', 'deep', 'world', 'characters', 'are', 'living', 'pulling', 'punches', 'way', 'see', 'good', 'bad', 'raw', 'emotions', 'result', 'Illusionist', 'however', 'stereotypical', 'class', 'differences', 'controlling', 'husband', 'are', 'used', 'place', 'real', 'emotion', 'stereotypes', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'true', 'era', 'case', 'needed', 'be', 'felt', 'instead', 'just', 'referenced.Overall', 'then', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'one', 'who', 'like', 'movies', 'deep', 'full', 'character', 'growth', 'quite', 'superficial', 'way', 'Yes', 'have', 'mind-blowing', 'reveal', 'so', 'many', 'areas', 'point', 'credibility', 'so', 'speak', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Prestige', 'alternative', 'yet', 'still', 'containing', 'very', 'similar', 'themes']",N/A

Edward Norton plays the emotionally-controlled character Eisenheim to perfection. His face displays icy calm most of the time, determination during his performances, and joy only in the arms of his beloved Sophie. Who knows what he is thinking but not saying -- but then, that is what magicians are all about. Jessica Biel gives a wonderful performance, unfolding a slowly increasing awareness that her childhood love for Eisenheim still lives within her. She brings warmth to an otherwise decidedly cool picture. On the basis of this performance, I am expecting great things in the future from this actress. Finally, Paul Giamatti is superb as the chief inspector. Eisenheim relies on the inspector's fundamental integrity, in spite of the obvious compromises the inspector has made to achieve his position. The inspector is the great risk at the center of the deception, so his reactions and course of action are crucial to the success of Eisenheim's gambit. Giamatti is wonderful in this role -- I would even say, a potential best supporting actor, except that this film is not likely to garner a sufficiently large audience to capture the attentions of the Academy.This is a well-directed movie -- tightly cut and well-conceived screen adaptation.

I hadn't heard very much hype about it and the trailer didn't really send me running out to see it, but after watching it, I think it was one of the best movies of 2006.Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, Rufus Sewell, and even Jessica Biel all turned in remarkable performances throughout the film. The entire supporting cast steps up as well. The cinematography was equally stunning, as was the story, which stays intriguing until the very last frame.The Illusionist is a romantic drama, a thriller, a mystery, and a period piece all in one, and it never leans too heavily on any of the genres in order to skate by. It lives in all these realms, but it also lives in its own independent category.The special features on the DVD were pretty meager: a making of featurette, and then a ""Jessica Biel on the Illusionist"" featurette that was really just the same comments she made in the making of featurette edited down to a shorter version. The film itself is so amazing that the DVD doesn't really need any extras, although it would be nice to get a more in depth look at Edward Norton's preperation for the role, and the magicians that trained him.",5,"If you haven't seen it, you're definitely missing out",1168992000,"01 17, 2007",2007,1216,"['Illusionist', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'movies', 'year', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'very', 'much', 'hype', 'trailer', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'send', 'running', 'out', 'see', 'watching', 'think', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '2006.Edward', 'Norton', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'even', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'turned', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'film', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'cinematography', 'was', 'equally', 'stunning', 'was', 'story', 'intriguing', 'very', 'last', 'frame.The', 'Illusionist', 'romantic', 'drama', 'thriller', 'mystery', 'period', 'piece', 'one', 'never', 'too', 'heavily', 'genres', 'order', 'skate', 'realms', 'also', 'own', 'independent', 'category.The', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'were', 'pretty', 'meager', 'making', 'featurette', 'then', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Illusionist', 'featurette', 'was', 'really', 'just', 'same', 'comments', 'made', 'making', 'featurette', 'edited', 'down', 'shorter', 'version', 'film', 'so', 'amazing', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'extras', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'get', 'more', 'depth', 'look', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'preperation', 'role', 'magicians', 'trained']",N/A
