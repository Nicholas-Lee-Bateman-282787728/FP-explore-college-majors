It is so hard to follow, there is something silly and trite about it.  ""WHY DID YOU BUY IT THEN, YOU IDIOT?"" I know, right... well I got one of the very first SPAWN action figures when McFarlane first introduced the toy line. My step father bought it for me and I was so young, I didnt know what I had and I took the toy apart.  YES... I know, I took the toy out of the packaging and played with it. I made a few adjustments to the toy as well, so that it would suit my childhood imagination.NE Way, I cannot say that I am a ""fan"" of SPAWN, I think the whole concept of a man dying and making a deal with ""The Devil"" and coming back all jacked up and powerful is really interesting.  I was really excited to see that an animated series like this came out and so I didnt hesitate, I was positive that I would love it. My step father was excited about a comic series that was predominately casted with Black Characters... imagine his surprise when he saw the creator, LOL.So far it is not BAD, but it is kind of slow and difficult to follow.  I am hoping that the whole thing is not limited to that damn alley.  I want to see more demons, more ""Devil"" and more of that creepy forbidden stuff thats make the show rated R -I do not mean cartoon nudity. I mean that dark, Anton LeVay type stuff.  So please, anyone out there, please hit me up, and give me a pep-talk.

1073355,A1RVYSEJCY9BJS,B000Q66PX4,A. Thomas,"[50, 51]","I was just a kid when the theatrical ""Spawn"" movie came out, but even then I could tell that the film just didn't live up to the idea; it was all popcorn explosions and CGI demons, devoid of substance.  A few years later, towards the end of high school, I came across the prior boxset release of this show.  Knowing it was well-reviewed, I decided to give it a try.""Todd McFarlane's Spawn"" is the opposite of the theatrical film, delving deeply into the psychology of this Hellspawn and his struggle between damnation and redemption.  The writing is subversive, alternately witty and utterly creepy; the animation is fluid and richly detailed; the voice-acting superb, with Keith David's Spawn and John Rafter Lee's Jason Wynn as the clear highlights of the cast.  Whether you're into comics, fantasy, film noir, or even simply well-written stories, I would recommend giving this show a watch.And now it's even better on this anniversary box set.  In the original release, each season of the show was edited together to form one two-and-a-half hour long movie; this would be daunting under normal circumstances, but for a show this bleak it's quite an achievement to get through.  Even worse, the films were presented on both sides of a ""flipper"" disc, increasing the danger of scratches.  Fortunately, this anniversary set presents all 3 seasons broken up into their individual episodes on a one-sided dual-layered disc, making for a much more palatable viewing experience (die-hards need not fear, however -- there's still a ""play all"" option on the menu).  The visuals are improved with truer blacks and more vibrant colors, and the audio has been upgraded to 5.1 surround from Dolby stereo.  Extras include commentary tracks from McFarlane on selected episodes, and a handful of featurettes on a fourth disc.  All this is included in a very attractive steelbook case featuring the pictured artwork at the top of the Amazon page.Very highly-recommended for a first-time viewer, and if any owner of the previous set is on the fence about upgrading, I believe that it's more than worth the increased quality and convenience offered in this new set.",5,"A quality animated show for adults, much improved over the old set",1231200000,"01 6, 2009",2009,2149,"['was', 'just', 'kid', 'when', 'theatrical', 'Spawn', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'even', 'then', 'could', 'tell', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'idea', 'was', 'popcorn', 'explosions', 'CGI', 'demons', 'devoid', 'substance', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'end', 'high', 'school', 'came', 'prior', 'boxset', 'release', 'show', 'Knowing', 'was', 'well-reviewed', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'Todd', 'McFarlane', 'Spawn', 'opposite', 'theatrical', 'film', 'delving', 'deeply', 'psychology', 'Hellspawn', 'struggle', 'damnation', 'redemption', 'writing', 'subversive', 'alternately', 'witty', 'utterly', 'creepy', 'animation', 'fluid', 'richly', 'detailed', 'voice-acting', 'superb', 'Keith', 'David', 'Spawn', 'John', 'Rafter', 'Lee', 'Jason', 'Wynn', 'clear', 'highlights', 'cast', ""'re"", 'comics', 'fantasy', 'film', 'noir', 'even', 'simply', 'well-written', 'stories', 'would', 'recommend', 'giving', 'show', 'watch.And', 'now', 'even', 'better', 'anniversary', 'box', 'set', 'original', 'release', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'edited', 'together', 'form', 'one', 'two-and-a-half', 'hour', 'long', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'daunting', 'normal', 'circumstances', 'show', 'quite', 'achievement', 'get', 'Even', 'worse', 'films', 'were', 'presented', 'sides', 'flipper', 'disc', 'increasing', 'danger', 'scratches', 'Fortunately', 'anniversary', 'set', 'presents', '3', 'seasons', 'broken', 'up', 'individual', 'episodes', 'one-sided', 'dual-layered', 'disc', 'making', 'much', 'more', 'palatable', 'viewing', 'experience', 'die-hards', 'need', 'not', 'fear', 'however', 'still', 'play', 'option', 'menu', 'visuals', 'are', 'improved', 'truer', 'blacks', 'more', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'audio', 'been', 'upgraded', '5.1', 'surround', 'Dolby', 'stereo', 'Extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'McFarlane', 'selected', 'episodes', 'handful', 'featurettes', 'fourth', 'disc', 'included', 'very', 'attractive', 'steelbook', 'case', 'featuring', 'pictured', 'artwork', 'top', 'Amazon', 'page.Very', 'highly-recommended', 'first-time', 'viewer', 'owner', 'previous', 'set', 'fence', 'upgrading', 'believe', 'more', 'increased', 'quality', 'convenience', 'offered', 'new', 'set']",The Animated Collection: Spawn

1073359,AAKIMS08BPBLZ,B000Q66PX4,benjamin,"[11, 42]","In truth, I was never a fan of the comic book when I was younger.  I am guessing that this is how views of the animated Spawn series break down; fans will likely love it, and those who are merely curious will likely not.  I am in the latter category.  I cannot deny that the animation is simply stunning - it takes Batman: The Animated Series and brings it to an adult level, with an epic level of shadow and mood.  But that is all that Todd McFarlane's Spawn: The Animated Collection has going for it.  The defects are threefold in my mind.  First, the story telling is so painfully slow, especially on the first disk, that one wonders where - if anywhere - the writers were.  There is almost no action in the series, although there is a tremendous amount of violence - too much, in my mind, and the excess is only one of several indicators of the considerable lack of imagination that drove the series.  The other evidences of this lack are the fairly extensive profanity and the nudity.  It's like the writers, when in doubt about what to say or do, simply deployed these instead.  Please understand that I do not offer these as a moral critique but, instead, as an intellectual one.  These cartoons have the intellectual depth of rap music, which I find that incredibly annoying.  Adult cartoons should be intelligent, sharp, and challenging.  Spawn is none of that.  Second, but related to this, I follow comic books on occasion and I think that it is interesting that around 2000 there were various debates about whether or not comic books were too violent and whether or not the golden age of comic heroes had truly been buried amidst a torrent of excessively violent and ultimately classless narratives.  (This sort of critique took form in various comics, particularly theKingdom Comeseries.)  Spawn fits this sort of critique fully.  He is less of an antihero and more of an immensely selfish figure who doesn't really care about the suffering and pain of others as he is too stuck on his own tragedy (perceived and real).  In other words, there is nothing compelling here, let alone ennobling, on a human level.  Finally, it seems that the series ended too early; the third disk ends with Spawn finally willing to do whatever he needs to do in order to regain his humanity.  Thus, three disks of 18 total episodes, totaling nearly nine hours of animation are, in effect, merely a tediously long origins story.  Combine this with a soundtrack that sounds like something out of a really bad B-movie and one is left with something that only fans will likely love.",1,Immensely Disappointing,1298073600,"02 19, 2011",2011,2571,"['truth', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'comic', 'book', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'am', 'guessing', 'how', 'views', 'animated', 'Spawn', 'series', 'break', 'down', 'fans', 'will', 'likely', 'love', 'who', 'are', 'merely', 'curious', 'will', 'likely', 'not', 'am', 'latter', 'category', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'animation', 'simply', 'stunning', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'adult', 'level', 'epic', 'level', 'shadow', 'mood', 'Todd', 'McFarlane', 'Spawn', 'Animated', 'Collection', 'going', 'defects', 'are', 'threefold', 'mind', 'First', 'story', 'telling', 'so', 'painfully', 'slow', 'especially', 'first', 'disk', 'one', 'wonders', 'where', 'anywhere', 'writers', 'were', 'almost', 'action', 'series', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'violence', 'too', 'much', 'mind', 'excess', 'only', 'one', 'several', 'indicators', 'considerable', 'lack', 'imagination', 'drove', 'series', 'other', 'evidences', 'lack', 'are', 'fairly', 'extensive', 'profanity', 'nudity', 'writers', 'when', 'doubt', 'what', 'say', 'do', 'simply', 'deployed', 'instead', 'Please', 'understand', 'do', 'not', 'offer', 'moral', 'critique', 'instead', 'intellectual', 'one', 'cartoons', 'have', 'intellectual', 'depth', 'rap', 'music', 'find', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'Adult', 'cartoons', 'should', 'be', 'intelligent', 'sharp', 'challenging', 'Spawn', 'none', 'Second', 'related', 'follow', 'comic', 'books', 'occasion', 'think', 'interesting', '2000', 'were', 'various', 'debates', 'not', 'comic', 'books', 'were', 'too', 'violent', 'not', 'golden', 'age', 'comic', 'heroes', 'had', 'truly', 'been', 'buried', 'torrent', 'excessively', 'violent', 'ultimately', 'classless', 'narratives', 'sort', 'critique', 'took', 'form', 'various', 'comics', 'particularly', 'theKingdom', 'Comeseries', 'Spawn', 'sort', 'critique', 'fully', 'less', 'antihero', 'more', 'immensely', 'selfish', 'figure', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'suffering', 'pain', 'others', 'too', 'stuck', 'own', 'tragedy', 'perceived', 'real', 'other', 'words', 'nothing', 'compelling', 'here', 'let', 'alone', 'ennobling', 'human', 'level', 'Finally', 'series', 'ended', 'too', 'early', 'third', 'disk', 'ends', 'Spawn', 'finally', 'willing', 'do', 'whatever', 'do', 'order', 'regain', 'humanity', 'Thus', 'three', 'disks', '18', 'total', 'episodes', 'totaling', 'nearly', 'nine', 'hours', 'animation', 'are', 'effect', 'merely', 'tediously', 'long', 'origins', 'story', 'Combine', 'soundtrack', 'something', 'really', 'bad', 'B-movie', 'one', 'left', 'something', 'only', 'fans', 'will', 'likely', 'love']",The Animated Collection: Spawn

The series dealed with a former soldier named Al Simmons (Voiced by Keith David) who was killed in the line of military duty was sent to hell, he made a deal with a devil named Malebolgia to get back on Earth so he can see his love Wanda again but only if he joins with Maelbolgia's army if he sends souls to hell so that the battle between Heaven and Hell may start. He is sent five years later only to find himself as a burned man with strange magical clothes and a shroud made from necroplasm, he is called Spawn and  wonders through the streets of New York to find out that the love of his love is married to his former best friend Terry Fitzgerald as they have a child together and that Al Simmons has been dead for 5 years as right now the battle between good and evil will start.A unique adult animated fantasy-horror-action series with excellent animation especially around the second and third seasons with some excellent voice acting by John Dystrat (""The Thing""), Ming Na Wen, John Rafter Lee (""Aeon Flux The Series"" and ""Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust""), Ronny Cox, James Hong, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Robert Forster, Eric Roberts, and Kurtwood Smith (""Robocop"").

1073374,A2QGP7E8LSC7TG,B000Q66PX4,Mark Baum,"[2, 2]","Admittedly I'm not one of those fanboys who merely followed along for the sake of Todd McFarlne's craft. Rather this is what introduced me to his work.Well before I discovered the art of anime and manga this was what I classified as cutting-edge animation. Before I discovered Adult Swim the only ""premium"" channel worth watching on cable was HBO (the selections on rural cable at the time were pretty bad). And this may have well cemented a higher standard of animated fare into the minds of HBO's audience.While I think the second season and onward had some weaknesses the story arc of the first season was breathtaking. It served as not just a solid introduction into the many characters but as its own movie in and of itself (early VHS editions simply edited all the first season episodes into one long animated movie and that worked out quite well). The visual styles employed were reminiscent of anime at the time leading to a solid mix of eastern and western sensibilities with a high dose of action especially at the end. And while I've seen the other seasons the first season just stuck with me.The animation isn't the best but it does a good enough job for the sake of cable presentation. Regarding its televised aspect ratio (4:3) there are certain scenes (most notably during the police chase in the first season's finale) that have been pan'n'scanned during their original broadcasts. The original DVD release shared this flaw as well. And here the original television broadcast aspect ratio is preserved. I can only hope that a full remaster is approved that shows this in its original widescreen form before being cropped to 4:3.But the real letdown is that the series ended too soon. HBO Animation folded before extra seasons could be produced. I wonder if HBO should've made this its signature animation series rather wasting time with the abysmally awful ""Spicy City"". And I wonder if the flop of ""Spawn; The Motion Picture"" by another Of Time Warner's entities, New Line, is another contributing cause for no more ""Spawn: The Animated Series"" episodes. I would love to hear that untold story.In any case, the Spawn motion picture was simply awful. When I want to turn friends onto Spawn I pop one of the Spawn animated series discs in. The voice acting is wonderful, the score perfectly matches the moods of the scenes and it's a perfect gateway into not just the Spawn comic series but for adult animation in general.

1073383,A2HOBRPX8EDQ9Y,B000Q66PX4,The Voice Of Treason,"[0, 0]","Well after suffering the old collection of the show for years and I was never really able to sit through the whole thing due to the format on the old discs due to the combination of it not being broken up by episode and the horrible flipdisc format they used on the media, I really missed this show and heard about how great a treatment it got in the 10th Anniversary set, I thought the price was pretty agreeable and decided to pick it up. The picture is improved big time and the new proper 5.1 sound mix is really good too, it really brings out the creep factor that I think was always intended in the shows sound design it gave it a lot more of a mood then I was ever used to it having, but in a positive way. I watched this show as it aired on HBO and then watched the VHS recordings I'd made then moved on to the old DVD set and this 10th anniversary edition is quite definitive so far as the quality of the picture, sound and packaging is concerned. I still thought they skimped a little on special features, it could have stood to have commentary on every episode, there are only 18 and as it stands there are only four commentary tracks on each season premier episode and then the final episode. They did include a whole bonus disc that had some neat stuff and I think some other stuff just to have on the back of the packaging as a special feature.It's been a while since I can recall a DVD collection of episodic television that was this well rounded for optimum ease of viewing, you can watch by episode or choose to play all they also have the entire DVD broken down in a separate menu by sections in the story. Selecting an episode from the one-at-a-time menu prompts you to another menu that features a brief synopsis of the episode which is nice for tracking down a particular episode you wanted to see, I wish more DVD sets of TV shows had this included in them.The packaging and disc artwork are just beautiful everything I liked about the show and it's style that was based on the first 20 issues of the comic book. The only thing I didn't like about the packaging was the clips that hold the discs, they are a real pain to get the disc off of and then a couple of them snapped under the slightest pressure. I've never seen insets like this before and I have a lot of DVD's, I don't know why they didn't just go with a more standard form makes me worry that someday my discs will just be floating around the case unsecured.This is a very dark both in content and artistic style show that moves very slowly at whats often a really sludgy pace. For a cartoon about a comic book super hero there really isn't much action and after the first three or four episodes it really doesn't follow the comic books at all and instead segues off into it's own contained story line apart from the comics. I don't really consider this to be a bad thing in any way I just thought I'd mention it for anyone reading who hasn't seen the show. Each episode is directed in a gothic horror style, like a monster movie where the monster is never seen all the way. I think throughout the whole course of the show you never once get a good look at Spawn, he's always obscured in a shadow or by his cloak. It's an interesting way to go about it, it's also beautifully voice acted by all involved Keith David is incredible as Spawn and everyone else is really well realized as well.",5,Watch this in the dark,1299024000,"03 2, 2011",2011,3373,"['Well', 'suffering', 'old', 'collection', 'show', 'years', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'able', 'sit', 'whole', 'thing', 'due', 'format', 'old', 'discs', 'due', 'combination', 'not', 'being', 'broken', 'up', 'episode', 'horrible', 'flipdisc', 'format', 'used', 'media', 'really', 'missed', 'show', 'heard', 'how', 'great', 'treatment', 'got', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'set', 'thought', 'price', 'was', 'pretty', 'agreeable', 'decided', 'pick', 'up', 'picture', 'improved', 'big', 'time', 'new', 'proper', '5.1', 'sound', 'mix', 'really', 'good', 'too', 'really', 'out', 'creep', 'factor', 'think', 'was', 'always', 'intended', 'shows', 'sound', 'gave', 'lot', 'more', 'mood', 'then', 'was', 'ever', 'used', 'having', 'positive', 'way', 'watched', 'show', 'aired', 'HBO', 'then', 'watched', 'VHS', 'recordings', ""'d"", 'made', 'then', 'moved', 'old', 'DVD', 'set', '10th', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'quite', 'definitive', 'so', 'far', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'packaging', 'concerned', 'still', 'thought', 'skimped', 'little', 'special', 'features', 'could', 'have', 'stood', 'have', 'commentary', 'episode', 'are', 'only', '18', 'are', 'only', 'four', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'season', 'premier', 'episode', 'then', 'final', 'episode', 'did', 'include', 'whole', 'bonus', 'disc', 'had', 'neat', 'stuff', 'think', 'other', 'stuff', 'just', 'have', 'back', 'packaging', 'special', 'feature.It', 'been', 'while', 'can', 'recall', 'DVD', 'collection', 'episodic', 'television', 'was', 'well', 'rounded', 'optimum', 'ease', 'viewing', 'can', 'watch', 'episode', 'choose', 'play', 'also', 'have', 'entire', 'DVD', 'broken', 'down', 'separate', 'menu', 'sections', 'story', 'Selecting', 'episode', 'one-at-a-time', 'menu', 'prompts', 'menu', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'episode', 'nice', 'tracking', 'down', 'particular', 'episode', 'wanted', 'see', 'wish', 'more', 'DVD', 'sets', 'TV', 'shows', 'had', 'included', 'them.The', 'packaging', 'disc', 'artwork', 'are', 'just', 'beautiful', 'everything', 'liked', 'show', 'style', 'was', 'based', 'first', '20', 'issues', 'comic', 'book', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'packaging', 'was', 'clips', 'hold', 'discs', 'are', 'real', 'pain', 'get', 'disc', 'then', 'couple', 'snapped', 'slightest', 'pressure', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'insets', 'have', 'lot', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'more', 'standard', 'form', 'worry', 'someday', 'discs', 'will', 'just', 'be', 'floating', 'case', 'unsecured.This', 'very', 'dark', 'content', 'artistic', 'style', 'show', 'very', 'slowly', 'whats', 'often', 'really', 'sludgy', 'pace', 'cartoon', 'comic', 'book', 'super', 'hero', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'action', 'first', 'three', 'four', 'episodes', 'really', ""n't"", 'follow', 'comic', 'books', 'instead', 'segues', 'off', 'own', 'contained', 'story', 'line', 'apart', 'comics', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'consider', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'way', 'just', 'thought', ""'d"", 'mention', 'anyone', 'reading', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'episode', 'directed', 'gothic', 'horror', 'style', 'monster', 'movie', 'where', 'monster', 'never', 'seen', 'way', 'think', 'whole', 'course', 'show', 'never', 'once', 'get', 'good', 'look', 'Spawn', 'always', 'obscured', 'shadow', 'cloak', 'interesting', 'way', 'go', 'also', 'beautifully', 'voice', 'acted', 'involved', 'Keith', 'David', 'incredible', 'Spawn', 'everyone', 'else', 'really', 'well', 'realized', 'as', 'well']",The Animated Collection: Spawn
1073384,A2KJAWEGJ64ZVV,B000Q66PX4,Todd B.,"[0, 0]","Let me be clear on this: THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS as a matter of fact I would not let a child of mine watch this until they were at least 16 or 17 years of age at this age they can better understand why and how the violence is being used, at younger ages they may think that the violence and tales of hell are simply cool and try to emulate them in the real world where as we adults know this is not acceptable or good, I'm not saying this to scare anyone off it is very violent and STRICTLY FOR ADULTS. with that being said this is a excellent show very well written it plays like a movie (some say better than the 2005 live action movie of the same name, I would agree with that) the violence is there but not the main focal point it is the story that will draw you in, without giving too much away it is the story of a man who dies by the evil doings of his boss who goes to hell right at the moment of his death and makes a deal with a high ranking demon, the deal is he will do whatever the demon wants without question for a chance to go back to earth to be with his wife Wanda whom he loves very much, of course the demon has a trick up his sleeve, true to his word the demon sends Al Simmons back to earth but it is five years later and Al doesn't know who or what he is and Wanda has moved on with her life married his best friend and had a child! Wow talk about your sad and deep story, but it is not a story of revenge it is about Al coping with the deal that he was dealth and becoming something more than HELLSPAWN! I would also like to say that the violence is not just thrown in or random it has a purpose for every violent act there is a reason why it is done (this is what helps the story be so good) the animation is excellent dark and gritty lots of shadow and most of the story takes place at night(sorta reminds me of Sin City the movie) dialogue is hard lots of cussing but again that is not what this is about, it has a point: to carry the story along, I can not say enough good about this series except get it you will not be sorry that you did it sells for $26 I got lucky and got it for $11.93 from a msg. From Amazon telling me about the reduced price, comes in a really cool steel book case with Todd McFarland art(the Creator of spawn) all over it shipping was fast 3 days b4 due date all around excellent purchase, I would only recommend this to adults.",5,"EXCELLENT ADULT ANIMATION, kids no!",1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,2379,"['Let', 'be', 'clear', 'THIS', 'NOT', 'FOR', 'KIDS', 'matter', 'fact', 'would', 'not', 'let', 'child', 'mine', 'watch', 'were', 'least', '16', '17', 'years', 'age', 'age', 'can', 'better', 'understand', 'why', 'how', 'violence', 'being', 'used', 'younger', 'ages', 'may', 'think', 'violence', 'tales', 'hell', 'are', 'simply', 'cool', 'try', 'emulate', 'real', 'world', 'where', 'adults', 'know', 'not', 'acceptable', 'good', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'scare', 'anyone', 'very', 'violent', 'STRICTLY', 'FOR', 'ADULTS', 'being', 'said', 'excellent', 'show', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'movie', 'say', 'better', '2005', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'would', 'agree', 'violence', 'there', 'not', 'main', 'focal', 'point', 'story', 'will', 'draw', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'evil', 'doings', 'boss', 'who', 'hell', 'right', 'moment', 'death', 'deal', 'high', 'ranking', 'demon', 'deal', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'demon', 'question', 'chance', 'go', 'back', 'earth', 'be', 'wife', 'Wanda', 'whom', 'very', 'much', 'course', 'demon', 'trick', 'up', 'sleeve', 'true', 'word', 'demon', 'Al', 'Simmons', 'back', 'earth', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'Al', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'what', 'Wanda', 'moved', 'life', 'married', 'best', 'friend', 'had', 'child', 'Wow', 'talk', 'sad', 'deep', 'story', 'not', 'story', 'revenge', 'Al', 'coping', 'deal', 'was', 'dealth', 'becoming', 'something', 'more', 'HELLSPAWN', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'say', 'violence', 'not', 'just', 'thrown', 'random', 'purpose', 'violent', 'act', 'reason', 'why', 'done', 'story', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'animation', 'excellent', 'dark', 'gritty', 'lots', 'shadow', 'most', 'story', 'place', 'night', 'sorta', 'Sin', 'City', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'hard', 'lots', 'cussing', 'again', 'not', 'what', 'about', 'point', 'carry', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'series', 'get', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'sorry', 'did', '26', 'got', 'lucky', 'got', '11.93', 'msg', 'Amazon', 'telling', 'reduced', 'price', 'really', 'cool', 'steel', 'book', 'case', 'Todd', 'McFarland', 'art', 'Creator', 'spawn', 'shipping', 'was', 'fast', '3', 'days', 'b4', 'due', 'date', 'excellent', 'purchase', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'adults']",The Animated Collection: Spawn
