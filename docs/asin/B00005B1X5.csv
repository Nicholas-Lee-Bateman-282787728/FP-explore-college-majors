579785,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005B1X5,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[16, 20]","It must be stated at the outset that this film has nothing whatsoever to do with Bruce Lee.  The star of the movie is actually Bruce Le, one of several Bruce Lee wannabe martial arts actors who followed in the wake of the true legend's shocking death.  Furthermore, this is by no means a biographical account of any part of Bruce Lee's life, despite the title and the blurb on the box cover which says &quot;Bruce Le portrays his tragic namesake.&quot;  The only tie of any kind with the real Bruce Lee comes in the opening scene, wherein an astrologer sees a meteor and makes a prediction concerning the young baby of the couple sitting beside him, after which a shot of the real Bruce Lee appears.  The fact that the film is not in truth about Bruce Lee at all comes very soon after the opening credits, though.In and of itself, putting aside its misleading title and description, The Legend of Bruce Lee does have legs to stand on, albeit sometimes rather shaky ones.  Bruce comes across as something of a juvenile delinquent who is constantly getting into fights (not always with good results).  In an effort to improve his skills, he begins taking instruction in the art of Wing Chun kung fu, which includes some training in the art of blindfolded boxing (this comes after Bruce gets kicked around pretty convincingly by a blind man on the streets).  After a time, he sort of abandons this type of fighting and begins training in the snake fist style.  All of this training comes in handy because he can't walk a block without being attacked by a gang of kung fu thuds.  The plot, what there is of it, is actually rather annoying, not to mention loosely tied together.  The only real plot point comes when one of Bruce's friends is murdered and Bruce decides to avenge his friend's death.There are some comical elements to this film, most of which revolve around a young man whom I would characterize as the Curly Howard of the Far East; he is little more than a buffoon whose antics become less funny as the movie progresses.  The remainder of the storyline needs no description because it is only a means to an end.  This film is really all about the fight scenes, and there are plenty of them. While these fights can be rather fun to watch, they definitely look choreographed (whereas the fights of the real Bruce Lee were quite realistic).  One nice surprise comes in the form of Kien Shih's role in the film; Bruce Lee fans will recognize him instantly as the man who played the evil Han (the villain with the claw) in Enter the Dragon.  Perhaps the most memorable aspect of this film, though, is the big snake scene.  After his snake fist kung fu master tells Bruce to study the actual movements of a snake, he wastes no time assembling a trio of impressively dangerous-looking serpents upon which to practice his moves in concert with their reactions to his extremely annoying feints and pseudo-attacks against them.Fans of the legendary Bruce Lee really have no reason to watch The Legend of Bruce Lee.  Martial arts fans, though, may well get some enjoyment out of watching it for the simple reason that it features a very significant amount of fighting.",3,"Not bad, but this film is not about Bruce Lee at all",1065052800,"10 2, 2003",2003,3168,"['must', 'be', 'stated', 'outset', 'film', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'star', 'movie', 'actually', 'Bruce', 'Le', 'one', 'several', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'martial', 'arts', 'actors', 'who', 'followed', 'wake', 'true', 'legend', 'shocking', 'death', 'Furthermore', 'biographical', 'account', 'part', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'life', 'title', 'blurb', 'box', 'cover', 'quot', 'Bruce', 'Le', 'tragic', 'namesake.', 'quot', 'only', 'tie', 'kind', 'real', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'opening', 'scene', 'wherein', 'astrologer', 'meteor', 'prediction', 'concerning', 'young', 'baby', 'couple', 'sitting', 'shot', 'real', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'fact', 'film', 'not', 'truth', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'very', 'soon', 'opening', 'credits', 'though.In', 'putting', 'aside', 'misleading', 'title', 'description', 'Legend', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'have', 'legs', 'stand', 'sometimes', 'rather', 'shaky', 'ones', 'Bruce', 'something', 'juvenile', 'delinquent', 'who', 'constantly', 'getting', 'fights', 'not', 'always', 'good', 'results', 'effort', 'improve', 'skills', 'taking', 'instruction', 'art', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'kung', 'fu', 'training', 'art', 'blindfolded', 'boxing', 'Bruce', 'kicked', 'pretty', 'convincingly', 'blind', 'man', 'streets', 'time', 'sort', 'abandons', 'type', 'fighting', 'training', 'snake', 'fist', 'style', 'training', 'handy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'walk', 'block', 'being', 'attacked', 'gang', 'kung', 'fu', 'thuds', 'plot', 'what', 'actually', 'rather', 'annoying', 'not', 'mention', 'loosely', 'tied', 'together', 'only', 'real', 'plot', 'point', 'when', 'one', 'Bruce', 'friends', 'murdered', 'Bruce', 'avenge', 'friend', 'are', 'comical', 'elements', 'film', 'most', 'revolve', 'young', 'man', 'whom', 'would', 'characterize', 'Curly', 'Howard', 'Far', 'East', 'little', 'more', 'buffoon', 'antics', 'become', 'less', 'funny', 'movie', 'remainder', 'storyline', 'description', 'only', 'means', 'end', 'film', 'really', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'plenty', 'fights', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'fun', 'watch', 'definitely', 'look', 'choreographed', 'fights', 'real', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'were', 'quite', 'realistic', 'One', 'nice', 'surprise', 'form', 'Kien', 'Shih', 'role', 'film', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'fans', 'will', 'recognize', 'instantly', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'evil', 'Han', 'villain', 'claw', 'Enter', 'Dragon', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'memorable', 'aspect', 'film', 'big', 'snake', 'scene', 'snake', 'fist', 'kung', 'fu', 'master', 'tells', 'Bruce', 'study', 'actual', 'movements', 'snake', 'time', 'assembling', 'trio', 'impressively', 'dangerous-looking', 'serpents', 'practice', 'moves', 'concert', 'reactions', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'feints', 'pseudo-attacks', 'them.Fans', 'legendary', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'really', 'have', 'reason', 'watch', 'Legend', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'Martial', 'arts', 'fans', 'may', 'well', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'simple', 'reason', 'very', 'significant', 'amount', 'fighting']",N/A

That's why it seems to be all over the place, why characters sort of come and go without explanation and why you're likely to feel like you're missing something when you watch it.

579793,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00005B1X5,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","(this review is for the 2010 movie, notthe 1976 one)CCTV's ""The Legend of Bruce Lee"" is the first biopic production of the Little Dragon to receive wide distribution in over fifteen years, followingDragon: The Bruce Lee Story. Originally broadcasted in fifty episodes in China, this three-hour edited film seems to be the best version of it that North America is going to receive, and thus I'll be reviewing it on its own merits. On the bright side, it's a relatively lavish production covering more aspects of Lee's life than I had expected, but on the down side, the movie uses its long runtime to be long-winded on certain subject to the point of boring you with them, and its action content certainly leaves a lot to be desired.The story focuses on the life of Lee (Danny Chan,Kung Fu Hustle) from his late high school days up to his death, highlighting events such as his introduction to wing chun, his struggle to teach martial arts to non-Asians in America, his development of jeet kune do, and his film career. An ongoing subplot about a fictional rivalry with a character known as Yellow Skin (Li Yuan, more or less taking the role of Wong Jack Man) is also prevalent. Things like his overcoming the race barrier and his relationship to his family are more or less glossed over (wife Linda, played by Michelle Lang, is present throughout the film but her character isn't expounded upon).Actors who've played Bruce Lee tend to fall into two categories: those who boast facial similarities to him (e.g. Bruce Lai, Bruce Ly) and those who've been able to replicate his physique (e.g. Bruce Le, Jason Scott Lee). Danny Chan falls into the former, and as far as portraying Lee theatrically, he does a pretty good job. He's able to exude Lee's confidence without the arrogance, and also plays a humbler dragon-in-training fairly well. However, just as this production seems to romanticize Lee, it also deconstructs him or at least his image as an unstoppable powerhouse. He gets beaten up no less than five times, which is a heck of a lot for a three-hour movie. It's a bit jarring for someone like me who knows Lee mainly for his feature film persona, but I suppose it's closer to life in this regard than other biopics.Dramatically, the movie is hit & miss: no single performer stands out particularly or does very poorly, but certain scenes fall flatter than others (e.g. the Linda/Bruce hospital bit). Other segments are fine, until they begin to drag: these mainly concern Bruce's initiation to kung fu and his revelation to create his own fighting style - two aspects which were disappointingly glossed over in my favorite Lee biopic, the aforementioned ""Dragon."" They're interesting and fulfilling to begin with, until you glance at the clock and realize that their expository monologues have been going on for over five minutes. Jeez! The movie makes a serious point about simplicity in martial arts but doesn't have any problem with long-windedness in dialogue.""Legend"" offers twelve separate fight scenes - a respectable number, allowing the film to average one fight every fifteen minutes. However, I'd be lying if I said I personally liked more than a third of the brawls. Generally, the choreography by Ma Zhong Xuan (who fought inJet Li's Fearless) doesn't attempt to replicate either the choreography of Lee's movies or the quick, efficient techniques he extolled in real life. This is okay by me, since it leads to less one-sided and longer fights, but I take issue with the occasionally excessive wire-fu and overzealous editing: it's completely out of place in a movie like this. Danny Chan has no less than four matches against Li Yuan, who isn't a particularly interesting fighter, but he sort of makes up with it with good-to-decent brawls against Ray Park (fromThe Phantom Menace, playing a Chuck Norris figure called Rolex), Mark Dacascos (Brotherhood of the Wolf, playing the Thai boxer fromFists of Fury), Gary Daniels (The Expendables, playing a nameless one-armed boxer), and a seemingly uncredited performer playing a tae kwon do master who I think represents Jhoon Rhee. The other matches range between so-so and throwaway quality. Michael Jai White (Blood & Bone) has a single scene as a Muhammad Ali-type character but doesn't fight at all - maybe in the extended TV show, but not in this movie.Overall, I'm disappointed by the movie, but fans with different expectations will probably find more things to like about it, or at least fewer things to mind. I concede that my experience would likely have been different if I had watched the entire series instead of just the movie, but until it becomes available to me in an affordable way, this is what I'm stuck with. It's certainly not the worst Bruce Lee feature ever put together, but I had hoped that a modern production would make a better all-around effort...or at least I had hoped that the Lions Gate editors would.",3,"""One's biggest rival is none but himself""",1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,4906,"['review', '2010', 'movie', 'notthe', '1976', 'one', 'CCTV', 'Legend', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'first', 'biopic',

579794,AURRFEI0X9JR2,B00005B1X5,"Neils C. Dunn ""tigersays""","[0, 0]","I don't know why the various producers of the movies made on Bruce Lee feel they have to remove or falsify events in his life.  Why do they keep portraying him being injured in a fight?  He was injured lifting a 125 pound weight without properly warming up.  The Rob Cohen movie was fancified to suit the taste of the average American viewer.  I don't know the rationale for this producer though his daughter, Shannon Lee, had hand in the production and I would think his wife, Linda Lee Cadwell would have lent her constructive input as well. I find the raw truth to be the most interesting portrayal of all.  I wish these movie producers felt that way.There is action and some accurate history on his childhood.  There is some drama and romance.  The movie is a one showing compilation of the series that played in China.  The actor captures some of Bruce Lee's onstage persona.  The voice over for Linda Lee is hard to listen to.  The fight sequences are good in some scenes as Bruce gets beat up learning to perfect his craft.  It would have been good to see his development to the actor from his start with Kato to Longstreet to his world famous four films.",4,Will the real Bruce Lee please rise?,1343260800,"07 26, 2012",2012,1162,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'various', 'producers', 'movies', 'made', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'feel', 'have', 'remove', 'falsify', 'events', 'life', 'Why', 'do', 'keep', 'portraying', 'being', 'injured', 'fight', 'was', 'injured', 'lifting', '125', 'pound', 'weight', 'properly', 'warming', 'up', 'Rob', 'Cohen', 'movie', 'was', 'fancified', 'suit', 'taste', 'average', 'American', 'viewer', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'rationale', 'producer', 'daughter', 'Shannon', 'Lee', 'had', 'hand', 'production', 'would', 'think', 'wife', 'Linda', 'Lee', 'Cadwell', 'would', 'have', 'lent', 'constructive', 'input', 'as', 'well', 'find', 'raw', 'truth', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'portrayal', 'wish', 'movie', 'producers', 'felt', 'action', 'accurate', 'history', 'childhood', 'drama', 'romance', 'movie', 'one', 'showing', 'compilation', 'series', 'played', 'China', 'actor', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'onstage', 'persona', 'voice', 'Linda', 'Lee', 'hard', 'listen', 'fight', 'sequences', 'are', 'good', 'scenes', 'Bruce', 'beat', 'up', 'learning', 'perfect', 'craft', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'see', 'development', 'actor', 'start', 'Kato', 'Longstreet', 'world', 'famous', 'four', 'films']",N/A

If you look past the mistakes in this movie, you can still enjoy it. ""The Legend of Bruce Lee"" 2008 starring Danny Chan and Michelle Lang is interesting insight into the life of Martial Arts Legend Bruce Lee. The film has a poor English dub, but the story solid and well thought out. The ""Legend of Bruce Lee"" covers some stories of Bruce Lee's life that were not in 1993's Dragon: the Bruce Lee Story directed by Rob Cohen. For one thing, this movie does feature one of Bruce Lee's student, Taky Kamura and Master Wang! In ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee story"" there is no student named Taky Kamura or teacher named Master Wang. I think this film should be given more credit. ""Legend of Bruce Lee"" was originally a 50-episode Chinese Television series that aired in Chinese Television in 2008. The film is footage taken from Chinese TV series and made into a 3 hour TV movie. I like the trailer and I feel the film is not that bad. I do admit there are flaws in this movie but I overall think ""The Legend of Bruce Lee"" is a great film and is worth owning on DVD! A+ Please give this DVD a chance!

579799,A3JKXSGK1U38M4,B00005B1X5,Taijiguy,"[1, 1]","This review is for the Chinese TV series, of which the DVD (which I haven't seen) is an extremely edited version. I'm giving it 5 stars, but I think it's a 4.5 star series. Personally, I don't see how thirty 45-minute episodes could possibly be cut down to 183 minutes without losing something (yes, it's 30 episodes, not 50 as some reviewers who haven't seen it have claimed). I began watching the series in China, but was unable to see the whole thing. Fortunately, Hulu has the full 30 episode version, so I was able to finish it. If you have Hulu, that's the way to watch it.There are certainly some inaccuracies and ommissions in the story line, even incorrect naming of actors in some of Lee's movies (e.g. Chuck Norris is a different martial artist in ""Way of the Dragon"" [a.k.a. ""Revenge of the Dragon""]). One of the funniest errors is one of the bad guys wearing a Justin Timberlake teeshirt. The subtitles are also inaccurate, as are all English translations of Chinese dialog in Chinese movies. But the martial arts is top-notch and the story is close enough to history to give the viewer a pretty good idea what kind of a person Bruce Lee was. Besides, this series is not meant to be a 100% accurate biography of Bruce Lee's life...it only claims to be based on his life. Danny Chan really did his homework in both Bruce Lee's affectations and martial arts styles. The other actors were also perfectly cast in their respective roles, especially Yu Chenghui, who plays the part of Ip Man (Master Ye) and is master and creator of Mei Hua Tang Lang Shuang Shou Jian and veteran of many Chinese Wushu movies and TV series, and Sun Jiankui, master of Zui Quan and Jian Shu. Both got their starts in the famous Shaolin Temple trilogy.I recommend not wasting your time watching a DVD that's only a shadow of the original TV series when you can get Hulu Plus for free for a week and watch the entire series.",5,"Watch the TV series, not the DVD",1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,1911,"['review', 'Chinese', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'extremely', 'edited', 'version', ""'m"", 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'think', '4.5', 'star', 'series', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'thirty', '45-minute', 'episodes', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'cut', 'down', '183', 'minutes', 'losing', 'something', 'yes', '30', 'episodes', 'not', '50', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'have', 'claimed', 'began', 'watching', 'series', 'China', 'was', 'unable', 'see', 'whole', 'thing', 'Fortunately', 'Hulu', 'full', '30', 'episode', 'version', 'was', 'able', 'finish', 'have', 'Hulu', 'way', 'watch', 'are', 'certainly', 'inaccuracies', 'ommissions', 'story', 'line', 'even', 'incorrect', 'naming', 'actors', 'Lee', 'movies', 'e.g', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'different', 'martial', 'artist', 'Way', 'Dragon', '[', 'a.k.a', 'Revenge', 'Dragon', ']', 'One', 'funniest', 'errors', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'wearing', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'teeshirt', 'subtitles', 'are', 'also', 'inaccurate', 'are', 'English', 'translations', 'Chinese', 'dialog', 'Chinese', 'movies', 'martial', 'arts', 'top-notch', 'story', 'close', 'enough', 'history', 'give', 'viewer', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'was', 'Besides', 'series', 'not', 'meant', 'be', '100', '%', 'accurate', 'biography', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'life', 'only', 'be', 'based', 'life', 'Danny', 'Chan', 'really', 'did', 'homework', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'affectations', 'martial', 'arts', 'styles', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'also', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'respective', 'roles', 'especially', 'Yu', 'Chenghui', 'who', 'part', 'Ip', 'Man', 'Master', 'Ye', 'master', 'creator', 'Mei', 'Hua', 'Tang', 'Lang', 'Shuang', 'Shou', 'Jian', 'veteran', 'many', 'Chinese', 'Wushu', 'movies', 'TV', 'series', 'Sun', 'Jiankui', 'master', 'Zui', 'Quan', 'Jian', 'Shu', 'got', 'starts', 'famous', 'Shaolin', 'Temple', 'trilogy.I', 'recommend', 'not', 'wasting', 'time', 'watching', 'DVD', 'only', 'shadow', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'when', 'can', 'get', 'Hulu', 'Plus', 'free', 'week', 'watch', 'entire', 'series']",N/A
