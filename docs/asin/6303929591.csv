389847,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6303929591,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 5/14Rate: 65/14: There are two sides of Squanto: the historically inaccurate one and the Disney one. For the former, I am going to suspend my disbelief and not to roll my eyes a bit too much. It's really impossible to believe that the English didn't see any natives since the Columbian Exchange had already been underway for well over a century. And how Squanto quickly picked up English so well and so fluently is probably another funny thing about the film. There is no way a grizzly bear be transported to England for amusement purposes; just no way. In fact, that can't have happened anyway. Usually, when the conquistadors arrive and meet with the natives, whatever the tribe is, for the first time, most of the indigenous population is later wiped out due to various of communicable diseases. So, it's a surprise to me that many have survived after the initial contact in Squanto. Ok, that's enough for history goofs. Anyway, as for the other side of Squanto, for a Disney film, it is surprisingly free of objectionable content minus several mostly masked violent scenes. The film can be safely shown to children with no objection, so I am pleased about it. I don't like how the villains, especially Michael Gambon's obsequious Sir George, are shown as caricatures. Now, there are three parts to Squanto: his home and the initial contact with the conquistadors, his time in England and with the monks, and the return back. The first one seems bland and is more of ""let's get it out of the way."" The second one is probably the best one although I feel the time with the monks should have been the focal point of concentration if that's what the film is going to end up being about. And the third part pretty much seals the film's fate as an imbalanced picture. The scene where Squanto tries to make a peace treaty stand with the pilgrims is too dangerous of an inclusion; so, I think the makers should have developed the plot more before its release because it seems that they aimed too high and missed the mark. It's fair to regard Squanto as a very lightweight Native American film when compared to touchstones: Dances With Wolves and The Last of the Mohicans. Speaking of the latter film, Eric Schweig is a familiar face in Squanto, but unfortunately, he isn't much of an actor and is largely overshadowed by his fifteen minutes of fame for being the penultimate Mohican. Adam Beach is not bad himself; however, he can't carry the weight of the film on his back as the male lead. All in all, if I have a choice between Squanto and any 30's to 50's picture involving Native Americans, I pick Squanto because it moves well, has nice costumes, and is not objectionable.",3,"Historical Inaccuracies Aside, It's an Acceptable Disney Film.",1401235200,"05 28, 2014",2014,2682,"['Viewed', '5/14Rate', '65/14', 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'Squanto', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'one', 'Disney', 'one', 'former', 'am', 'going', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'not', 'roll', 'eyes', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'really', 'impossible', 'believe', 'English', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'natives', 'Columbian', 'Exchange', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'underway', 'well', 'century', 'how', 'Squanto', 'quickly', 'picked', 'up', 'English', 'so', 'well', 'so', 'fluently', 'probably', 'funny', 'thing', 'film', 'way', 'grizzly', 'bear', 'be', 'transported', 'England', 'amusement', 'purposes', 'just', 'way', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'happened', 'anyway', 'Usually', 'when', 'conquistadors', 'arrive', 'meet', 'natives', 'tribe', 'first', 'time', 'most', 'indigenous', 'population', 'later', 'wiped', 'out', 'due', 'various', 'communicable', 'diseases', 'So', 'surprise', 'many', 'have', 'survived', 'initial', 'contact', 'Squanto', 'Ok', 'enough', 'history', 'goofs', 'Anyway', 'other', 'side', 'Squanto', 'Disney', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'free', 'objectionable', 'content', 'minus', 'several', 'mostly', 'masked', 'violent', 'scenes', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'safely', 'shown', 'children', 'objection', 'am', 'pleased', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'villains', 'especially', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'obsequious', 'Sir', 'George', 'are', 'shown', 'caricatures', 'Now', 'are', 'three', 'parts', 'Squanto', 'home', 'initial', 'contact', 'conquistadors', 'time', 'England', 'monks', 'return', 'back', 'first', 'one', 'bland', 'more', 'let', 'get', 'way', 'second', 'one', 'probably', 'best', 'one', 'feel', 'time', 'monks', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'focal', 'point', 'concentration', 'what', 'film', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'third', 'part', 'pretty', 'much', 'seals', 'film', 'fate', 'imbalanced', 'picture', 'scene', 'where', 'Squanto', 'make', 'peace', 'treaty', 'stand', 'pilgrims', 'too', 'dangerous', 'inclusion', 'so', 'think', 'makers', 'should', 'have', 'developed', 'plot', 'more', 'release', 'aimed', 'too', 'high', 'missed', 'mark', 'fair', 'regard', 'Squanto', 'very', 'lightweight', 'Native', 'American', 'film', 'when', 'compared', 'touchstones', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'Speaking', 'latter', 'film', 'Eric', 'Schweig', 'familiar', 'face', 'Squanto', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'much', 'actor', 'largely', 'overshadowed', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'fame', 'being', 'penultimate', 'Mohican', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'not', 'bad', 'however', 'ca', ""n't"", 'carry', 'weight', 'film', 'back', 'male', 'lead', 'have', 'choice', 'Squanto', '30', '50', 'picture', 'involving', 'Native', 'Americans', 'pick', 'Squanto', 'well', 'nice', 'costumes', 'not', 'objectionable']",Squanto: A Warrior's Tale VHS

Unfortunatly Disney feels the need to slap a true life title on some movies to associate them with real people and so I only gave it three stars when it should have been four or five. Just like they did with the Pocohontas movie. Both are mostly fiction and have nothing to do with the real stories. Squanto just like Pocohontas was real, this movie's only likeness to Squanto's true life is being befriended by monks (not Spanish though as they should have been), and finding his village wiped out from disease after years of being away. The rest is mostly fiction made up by writers hailing from the old Westerns where Native Americans and Europeans fought all the time. I guess they thought that would be more exciting. Personally I say Disney, either tell the true story or call it another name. Call this Soaring Hawk or some other name, just not Squanto and then it becomes acceptable to all.

389863,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6303929591,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[34, 39]","The producers of this movie should have titled it, ""Squanto: How We Would Have Scripted His Life.""  It took me a while to figure out fact from the fiction regarding Squanto's life.  Unfortunately, this movie not only skipped the facts, it added confusion to them.Let us begin with the facts.  There was a Native American named Tisquantum, whom the Pilgrims called Squanto.  Squanto was tricked into going to England in 1605.  Squanto learned English during his stay in England.  Eventually Squanto returned to North America, in 1614, with a pair of English ships.  One of the two ships returned to England, leaving Squanto behind.  The remaining English captain kidnapped Squanto and twenty-six other Native Americans and took them to Spain to sell them as slaves.  Local friars in Spain discovered what was happening and took the Native Americans into custody with the intent of teaching them Christianity.  In 1618, Squanto boarded a ship bound for Newfoundland.In Newfoundland, Squanto was recognized and taken back to England.  Squanto returned to North America in 1619 to aid in mapping the coast and in re-establishing trade with Native Americans.  Squanto learned that disease had destroyed his village, so he moved in with a neighboring tribe.  The following year the Pilgrims landed approximately at the site of Squanto's village.  Squanto helped the Pilgrims survive by teaching them how to find native fish and how to fertilize crops.Eventually, Squanto abused his influence over the Pilgrims and manipulated the local tribes.  Massasoit, the local sachem, or high chief, asked the Pilgrims to turn Squanto over to him for execution.  Either fortunately or unfortunately, an English ship arrived, distracting everyone.  Before Massasoit could force the Pilgrims to turn Squanto over to Massasoit, he contracted a fever and died in 1622.I think these are the basic facts of Squanto's life.  There are some minor disagreements between sources, but most sources seem to generally agree on the details above.The movie seems to have mixed and matched facts to make a faster-paced, completely fictional story.  For example, we see Squanto kidnapped and taken to England, where he wrestles a bear.  Squanto escapes and encounters friars, who teach him English.  Squanto befriends a hawk, so we get a bit of mysticism in the story.  In case you had yet to notice, mysticism and Native Americans sells movies.Squanto tricks his way back into the New World.  Squanto heads off to his village, only to find it gone.  Squanto then wanders about in the woods until he encounters another tribe and Pilgrims, about ready to kill each other off.  Fortunately, Squanto halts the bloodshed before it really gets started.  There is an incident in the movie where the son of a sachem is shot and a Pilgrim doctor saves the child and everyone lives happily ever after; or, as the epilogue tells us at the end of the movie, everyone lives happily for two generations until they forget the lesson of Squanto.Squanto was a real person.  Squanto helped the Pilgrims.  Without Squanto, the Pilgrims likely would have all died in their first year in the New World.  Stick to those facts and you can hardly go wrong.  The movie went well beyond those facts, with a reinterpretation of history that borders on the absurd.  If you show your children this movie, warn them that this movie is completely fictional, except for the facts at the beginning of this paragraph.  You may also pose a problem for slightly older children.  Watch this movie and see how many historical errors you can find with library and internet research.  This movie is a possible object lesson to teach children that they should question the garbage that can go into a ""historically inspired"" movie.This movie does do one thing well, and that is its general portrayal of Native Americans.  Much of what you see, minus the mysticism and some of the details, is relatively accurate.  Many of the actors are Native Americans (at least they got THAT right).  Had Disney used the same accuracy with the rest of the movie, they would have done fine.I love movies that have high family values.  I love historically inspired movies.  However, this movie is beyond inspired and is a completely fictional version of a real human being's life.  Why Disney felt they had to go this far is beyond me.  Sure, Disney magnified and sanitized Davy Crockett's life, but at least Disney got the gist of Crockett's life correct and much of it was a bit tongue-in-cheek; Disney completely missed with Squanto.
