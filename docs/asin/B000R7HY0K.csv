The previews which were why we got a copy!Anyway, as for the movie by Sacred Cow Tarantino Lord Supreme of film geeks and fanboys the world over....... DEATH PROOF woulda been way cooler in 1970-something in an actual grindhouse theater while your too busy being loaded and making out with a chick to pay attention the whole time to all the drawn-out pretentious dialog. Yea, yea, a lot of it is clever. So clever. Ain't it funny this was played with another movie + all those fantastic 'previews' when KILL BILL was divided into 2 movies? Somethings that make DEATH PROOF good: Of course Kurt Russell was good. And there were some pretty female bodies to look at. I enjoyed Stuntman Mike fearlessly confronting the chick posse on the porch to get his lap dance and his little John Wayne impersonation. The two regular dorky guys scheming how to get some action. Russell sloppily scarfing down nachos was a nice and gross touch. (Maybe he knew that'd probably be his last tasty meal for awhile...) Tying DEATH PROOF with KILL BILL and PLANET TERROR with the Sheriff. And then Stuntman Mike getting his come uppings at the end was good--a nice ""empowering"" ending for women in the updated fake grindhouse movie for us. Also, the car was cool.Don't buy this DVD.

1079686,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000R7HY0K,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[30, 57]","Going into a Quentin Tarantino movie, you know you have to expect carnage.  In his latest picture, `Death Proof' I thought by mid-movie, I had entered into a misogynists' paradise.  Not so.  Although you'll understand my misconception.  As most people have pointed out, this film is Tarantino's homage to B-movies.  It even has moments with threads going down the movie or reel changes done like you are sitting at a local theater in the day when they didn't have multiplexes, and the technician showing the movie was asleep at the wheel.Taking place in Texas and Tennessee, a Hollywood stunt car driver, actually named ""Stuntman Mike"" (Kurt Russell) stalks beautiful models and Hollywood actresses on the scene, so that he can take them for a ride in his professional car.  He calls it ""Death Proof"" because of its design.  What he doesn't tell them is as dangerous as his grudge.  Using a black car with a white skull and crossbones, the whole affair comes across like a Joyce Carol Oates short story without the feeling of tragedy.Making a comparison to his other movies, some of which I truly enjoyed, revealed my problem with this one.  `Pulp Fiction'Pulp Fiction (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)had us involved with quirky situations and the characters played by Bruce Willis and John Travolta, entertained us so well.  In 'Kill Bill 1'Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2 (Box Set)we were dished out a martial arts extravaganza culminating in an exquisitely violent and beautiful sword scene played out in a winter garden.  Then, 'Kill Bill 2' we were enthralled by the twists, turns, and tension laid out by the key players.  In both movies, we empathized with the pathos, comedy, and tragedy as experienced by Uma Thurman's character.  Our meeting with Bill, played by David Carradine, was no anti-climax, either.  We were in awe and shock mode, and knew that mostly we weren't supposed to take it all so seriously.My main problem with 'Death Proof' is that, although we have finely drawn characters in the film,' we don't care about them.  The chic chatter of the core female protagonists is meant to get us to hope for their demise.  In the end we hope the road rage ends both the misogynist (played skillfully in a creepy way by Kurt Russell) and the prima donnas who end up in his sites.  The road chase scenes are lively and capture a close up brutality, and the honky-tonk bar scenes certainly provide an exposition that is sordid and detailed.  He's got it right conceptually and visually.  It's just much of the story and characterization often fail.  What we get is a lot of wasted talk time and little of the novelties of past Tarantino adventures.  It's just no fun anymore.(One thing that does match 'Pulp Fiction' is the soundtrack.

But I'm not surprised most people didn't know about the separate dvd releases since it was in and out of the theaters very quickly . I wasn't surprised that it didn't do very well either , since it was basically an exercise in nostalgia and most movie goers today are young people who never experienced B movie double features . In that respect it was a calculated gamble by Weinstein to ever give the go ahead for this movie to begin with .Of the two I liked Deathproof much better , it had the feel and look of a 70s movie with Kurt Russell in a kind of psycho version of the Snake Pliskin character  . The only nudity though was in the Machete fake trailer which was disappointing since it was advertised as a movie that outdid any of the old B movies in every way and delivered on things that those old flicks never did  . Apparently that only applied to the gore in Planet Terror .I don't like the way movie companies try to get fans to buy movies multiple times either -with packaged sets , special editions ,director's cuts ,later releases on HD/Blu Ray , and so on .

I simply HAD to have the Blu version of Death Proof even though, past experience with the Kill Bill 'Blus' was a strong indication that this first Blu-ray edition wasn't going to offer much more than the DVD on-purpose-trashy-looking package. And almost right I was. As with the Kill Bills, the Blu edition has, on one disk only (nice), the 'extended and unrated' version of the movie and all the extras found on the 2-DVD edition. The 3 extra extras not found on the DVD are:- The uncut version of 'Baby, it's you' with Mary Elizabeth Winstead (absolutely beautiful, a capella)- A Death Proof 'international trailer' presented in VCR-like resolution (if he likes the way you move, then he decides the way you die)- Extended music cues, whatever they are- BD Live (see the first paragraph) for the full explanation- Audio is available in English, French, Italian and Spanish, ALL as 5.1 Dolby, with the default English sound as 5.1 TrueHD.Discussing the picture quality of a movie that's 'scratched' on purpose is not easy.

1079691,A20HNT8HYIYY0X,B000R7HY0K,"Adrian Stranik ""Ade""","[4, 4]","Quentin Tarantino's `5th' film Death Proof was originally conceived as the second part of a `Grindhouse' double bill with Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror. The idea was to replicate the 70's exploitation movie experience of low budget shclock opera's, where the posters are better than the actual films, and which have clearly been such a huge influence on both filmmakers - missing reels, scratched celluloid, gate hairs, tacky trailers and kitsch corporate graphics all to an ear splitting trumpet-loaded soundtrack. It certainly took me back to the pre-multiplex days of my childhood when audiences had enough of an attention span to watch two films back to back with barely a moment in between to restock on Embassy No10's and another carton of Kia-Ora.I saw the original Grindhouse `double bill' version in New York back in April, and appreciated it for the great bit of self indulgence it is on the part of the directors who should be in the happy position of being able to make the movies they want without having to worry too much about box office returns and studio interference. Unfortunately somewhere in the crossfire of a Mexican standoff between the producers, marketing department, distributors and the directors themselves Grindhouse has been mutilated, Black Dahlia-like, and unceremoniously dumped in two halves on U.K audiences. Although reviews were good, Grindhouse flopped in the states, so, with what appears to be a case of contagious cold feet tippy-toeing their way across the Atlantic, our distributors have decided that we're incapable of handling the Grindhouse experience in its entirety - hence releasing Tarantino's half as his 5th film.Death Proof is an intentionally slight tale of psychopathic `Stuntman Mike' (Kurt Russell) who gets his kicks causing car crashes in his specially designed `death proof' Chevy Nova (and later a Dodge Charger) in which everyone except himself is killed. After targeting yet another group of nubile young girls as his next victims the tables are turned and Stuntman Mike becomes the subject of their bloody revenge.Considering the promise of mucho car-nage that the premise suggests Death Proof is dialogue heavy; but then one line of Tarantino's dialogue is more action packed than all of Diesel, Seagal and Van Damme's `roid' fests put together - and when the violence does descend, it falls hard. But isolated from the Grindhouse concept, Death Proof pales besides the likes of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. A 127 minute re-cut of the movie was shown at the Cannes Film Festival last May in an attempt to bring it up to the standard of Tarantino's other outings and this, I believe, is the version U.K audiences are about to witness.Unfortunately the faux-trailers of `forthcoming attractions' such as Machete, Hobo with a Shotgun and Werewolf Women of the S.S (with Nicolas Cage as Fu Manchu!) which split the original Grindhouse version are not included. This sequence was the highlight of the whole movie and I know I'm not the only one who hoped that they would actually turn some of these spoofs into real films.

1079692,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000R7HY0K,A. Estes,"[4, 8]","To say ""Grindhouse"" was perhaps the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time would be a gross understatement. The genius of Robert Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" combined was matched only by the disappointment of a movie-going public virtually ignoring such a rich and colorful experience. Would you rather text message or crinkle your candy wrappers through a single, overpriced movie, which will likely be a remake or a sequel as opposed to being treated to two fun, campy, quality films for the price of one? What could have, should have been a film history milestone went by generally unnoticed, and we can probably place half the blame of seperating these movies into two full-priced DVD's on that fact alone.But I digress. It's hard not to let the disappointment of not being able to enjoy the ""Grindhouse"" experience at home damper your mood, but in reality, ""Death Proof"" was an excellent movie all in itself, so it merits it's own release. For Quentin Tarantino's sixth full-length film, we are treated to a John Carpenter-esque stalker/slasher movie that, oddly enough, features a man behind a wheel doing all the damage. Kurt Russell plays Stuntman Mike. Mike has a rather fancy, souped-up Chevy Nova that has been outfitted so extensively that he can survive any car crash. Trick is, as one poor lady finds out mid-way through the movie, you have to be in the passenger seat to take advantage of it's benefits. Mike goes through the first half of the film taking pleasure in high-speed action worthy of a major motion picture action (hmmm...) that doesn't fare too well for the people on the other end. It's not until he comes across a group of tough as nails, but rather chatty ladies that he meets his match and the killer becomes the victim. ""Death Proof"" works like a strange blend of the original ""Gone In Sixty Seconds"" and ""Halloween."" It succeeds because it's a new take on old material and actually builds characters that are real and relateable.A blurb on the back of the DVD case totes this as Tarantino's most original film since ""Pulp Fiction."" That statement is not too far off. Whereas ""Jackie Brown"" and both volumes of ""Kill Bill"" also paid homage to movies of past, ""Death Proof"" stands out because it has an unmistakeable Tarantino vibe to it, and what is usually typical, predictable material is turned on it's head and spun in only the way Quentin can. It's got great characterization, realistic dialogue, intense action scenes and one satisfying ending. Even if the DVD features leave a bit to be desired -- you can smell the double-dip coming next year -- it's still worth buying the ""Grindhouse"" features seperately, as ""Death Proof"" is presented in an extended fashion here, with material that helps the film stand by itself even better. Pretty much a perfect movie that I would recommend to anyone who loves Quentin Tarantino, cars and slasher flicks.",5,Pure Tarantino,1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,2930,"['say', 'Grindhouse', 'was', 'perhaps', 'most', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'had', 'movies', 'long', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'gross', 'understatement', 'genius', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'Planet', 'Terror', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Death', 'Proof', 'combined', 'was', 'matched', 'only', 'disappointment', 'movie-going', 'public', 'virtually', 'ignoring', 'such', 'rich', 'colorful', 'experience', 'Would', 'rather', 'text', 'message', 'crinkle', 'candy', 'wrappers', 'single', 'overpriced', 'movie', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'remake', 'sequel', 'opposed', 'being', 'treated', 'two', 'fun', 'campy', 'quality', 'films', 'price', 'one', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'history', 'milestone', 'went', 'generally', 'unnoticed', 'can', 'probably', 'place', 'blame', 'seperating', 'movies', 'two', 'full-priced', 'DVD', 'fact', 'digress', 'hard', 'not', 'let', 'disappointment', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'enjoy', 'Grindhouse', 'experience', 'home', 'mood', 'reality', 'Death', 'Proof', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'own', 'release', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'sixth', 'full-length', 'film', 'are', 'treated', 'John', 'Carpenter-esque', 'stalker/slasher', 'movie', 'oddly', 'enough', 'man', 'wheel', 'doing', 'damage', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'Mike', 'rather', 'fancy', 'souped-up', 'Chevy', 'Nova', 'been', 'outfitted', 'so', 'extensively', 'can', 'survive', 'car', 'crash', 'Trick', 'one', 'poor', 'lady', 'out', 'mid-way', 'movie', 'have', 'be', 'passenger', 'seat', 'take', 'advantage', 'benefits', 'Mike', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'taking', 'pleasure', 'high-speed', 'action', 'worthy', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'action', 'hmmm', ""n't"", 'fare', 'too', 'well', 'people', 'other', 'end', 'not', 'group', 'tough', 'nails', 'rather', 'chatty', 'ladies', 'match', 'killer', 'victim', 'Death', 'Proof', 'strange', 'blend', 'original', 'Gone', 'Sixty', 'Seconds', 'Halloween', 'new', 'take', 'old', 'material', 'actually', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'relateable.A', 'blurb', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'Tarantino', 'most', 'original', 'film', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'statement', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'off', 'Jackie', 'Brown', 'volumes', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'also', 'paid', 'homage', 'movies', 'past', 'Death', 'Proof', 'out', 'unmistakeable', 'Tarantino', 'vibe', 'what', 'usually', 'typical', 'predictable', 'material', 'turned', 'head', 'spun', 'only', 'way', 'Quentin', 'can', 'got', 'great', 'characterization', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'intense', 'action', 'scenes', 'one', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'Even', 'DVD', 'features', 'leave', 'bit', 'be', 'desired', 'can', 'smell', 'double-dip', 'coming', 'next', 'year', 'still', 'worth', 'buying', 'Grindhouse', 'seperately', 'Death', 'Proof', 'presented', 'extended', 'fashion', 'here', 'material', 'film', 'stand', 'even', 'better', 'Pretty', 'much', 'perfect', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'cars', 'slasher', 'flicks']",Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof

1079695,A23L2BR07AOBG1,B000R7HY0K,alex bushman,"[29, 45]","I believe this cumulative film ""Grindhouse"" was an exciting adventure and idea, but this film isn't good. What's most troublesome is that the film is filled with good actors and things just aren't working out. QT alienates people from the films he says he loves in this film by calling them out and then providing a film that vastly underperforms and fails to live up to the mold. I believe I read an interview with him about this film in which he describes the other film as a straighahead zombie movie, whereas this one is a ""more complicated hybrid"" of the chase thriller. Ahem, no this isn't a complicated genre, Quentin, you just have to clutter up a simple structure with your pointless dialogue and that makes it ""complicated"" and ""bad."" The thing that really makes this film's demise worse is that the beginning isn't all that bad and the sequences featuring Kurt Russell are actually very good, but when he's not onscreen and we have to play the ""we're going to learn all about these girls and their lives"" setup game, it completely throws off the momentum of the film. Frankly, he's used the random mundane dialogue in the past and it comes off as endearing, but here it doesn't work because we're both expecting and not expecting it. Previously it worked because the characters otherwise had a bite to them and were interesting, or the things they said were an odd juxtaposition to their occupation (Pulp Fiction).  Here we have four women who are everyday women, they have mundane jobs on a film set, save for the one who can't act, and they talk about the most mundane things imaginable. There's no setup to the plot with these women, they seem conspicously separate from the rest of the movie and that's the problem, there's no connection or intrigue as to why Stuntman Mike chooses them, they're just completely random. The first group of girls, although still a bit yawn-inducing at least had some intrigue prompting their inclusion. We never get that with these women and it feels like most of the film is about them. Also, we don't truly believe that Stuntman Mike wouldn't be able to kill them, it really seems as if he's been doing this awhile and knows how to be efficient.QT does telegraph the fact these women won't be dying with his inclusion of a character played by a female stuntwoman with the implication being that Stuntman Mike can only kill women who don't know how to play it safe, but if he comes across someone who knows how to play it dangerous and still come out ok, then he's toast.  I don't buy it for a minute and found the resolution lame. The ending is so light-hearted and crappy in a ""girls just having a good time"" kinda way.  This isn't a chick flick and it has no place being here. There's only a few tense moments in this film, when Kurt Russell approaches the girl to give him a lapdance, and when he kills one of the women in his car. Other than that, everything else feels incredibly safe, even the dangerous car stunt that Zoe Bell pulls off.It doesn't even have some of the campy charm that's found in Planet Terror, also not a classic, but still some fun. There's one thing I can say for this DVD (that I haven't seen) it might possibly be more interesting than the theatrical version, but I can't imagine it being so with all that pointless girltalk dominating the middle and later portions of the film it would just make it more interminable.Here's hoping that Tarantino comes back with a film that can not only be decent, but stand on it's own.

Secondly, the next group of girls deserved to die in a horrible car crash after putting themselves in such a moronic situation, especially after leaving one of their friends behind to be raped in deliverance country.

1079709,AI46E73DWKD2B,B000R7HY0K,BackToGood,"[1, 3]","Although I think Quentin Tarantino is an overrated filmmaker, most of his films, even some of his weaker efforts, have some interesting things in and going for them. I'd say the ""first half"" of his career is way superior to the ""second half"". The first half starts with RESERVOIR DOGS, a very unique and groundbreaking film, immediately followed by and improved upon in the stellar and engrossing PULP FICTION, and then culminating with KILL BILL VOLUME ONE, which I think is Tarantino's best film. I think VOLUME TWO is where he began to show signs of decline, but this film, DEATH PROOF, is really the ""proof"" (pun intended!) that he was spiraling downward as a good filmmaker!The thing is, though, as bad as I think DEATH PROOF is, I think his most recent INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is just as bad and perhaps even worse! And I know there are a LOT of people that do not think this. But here's part of my reasoning...DEATH PROOF at the very least has what I think can be called an actual ""plot"" and additionally, unlike INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, DEATH PROOF actually has a true central character that the viewer can latch onto, aka, Stuntman Mike (played wonderfully by Kurt Russell, who is woefully trapped in this weak film). The ONLY reason that DEATH PROOF gets the extra star is because of Stuntman Mike! HE is an interesting character. Russell conveys his creepiness effectively and gives one of the very few REAL performances in the film. I think Russell is just as good in DP as Christoph Waltz was in IB, but Waltz was considered to be in the better film, so his performance got more praise and accolades, while Russell was stuck in a film that was both critically and financially unsuccessful. Waltz's character Landa in IB, although a standout, was not really the central character that drove the story; Tarantino didn't have one! So one common thread of DP and IB is that both films have a single great character in the midst of a sea of lesser characters; the other common thread is that both films have endless, go-nowhere, empty dialogue being quoted mostly by Tarantino pupils.In addition to Russell, honorable mention should also go to Vanessa Ferlito, who authentically plays Butterfly, and Rose McGowan, who, aside from being stuck in a terrible blond wig, gives a good performance. But the rest of the female characters in DEATH PROOF range from being annoyingly nonessential (Jordan Ladd, Mary Elizabeth Winstead) to just plain ANNOYING (Rosario Dawson, Zoe Bell, Sydney Tamii Poitier, Tracie Thoms)! They are cardboard cutout characters that are simply there to quote Tarantino-esque dialogue. The first set of girls (Ferlito, Poitier, Ladd) are definitely more interesting than the second set (Dawson, Bell, Thoms, Winstead) simply because we can latch onto Ferlito's Butterfly through the first hour to keep us intrigued by what's to happen when Stuntman Mike arrives, when things actually get interesting. Sadly, Ferlito's character gets diluted somewhat by the very weak characters played by Poitier and Ladd, neither of whom are interesting in the least! Poitier's character talks too much and Ladd's character is just there.But then here is where I think Tarantino really screws up b/c instead of going the direction of delving deeper into Stuntman Mike's story and connection to the first set of girls, he shifts the focus to the second group, NONE of whom have any interesting traits or qualities. All they do is just ramble on about nonsense (difference between Aussies and New Zealanders) and do nonsensical things, like randomly drive through the backwoods of Tennessee and just HAPPEN to run across a guy with a Dodge Challenger in pristine condition just to set up the climax! The second hour is a total, unwatchable snoozefest that drowns DEATH PROOF! I know I said that DP has a plot and it does and it is simple...Stuntman Mike! He's the driving force of the story and Tarantino SHOULD have kept the focus on him and the somewhat interesting first story. I still think DP would have suffered from some of the amateurish acting by a couple of the first set of principal characters, but at least the movie as a whole would have been a lot better!DEATH PROOF

FromReservoir Dogs,From Dusk Till Dawn, theKill Billduet (One and Two), and now the GRINDHOUSE couplet (DEATH PROOF andPlanet Terror), Mr. Tarantino likes to play with crimson. And he sometimes does it very well.What makes Death Proof watchable is its homage to the drive-in days of early technicolor when scratchy editing and concession stand intermissions were commonplace. The story itself is fairly unremarkable (with the exception of Kurt Russell's performance as Stuntman Mike, a psychotic, out-of-work, stuntman who has girl issues for no apparent reason). His mood swings from depression to exhilaration are done well and mark him as the crux that holds Death Proof together.The ""Tarantino Girls"" are sure to be eye-candy for most male watchers, their languorously long legs and tight Daisy-Duke shorts being a bit overly focused upon. Although this is what makes Tarantino films appealing, especially when harkening back to the 70's when big hair and revealing clothing were making their way into the mainstream.And what Tarantino flick would be complete without some cool cars. Souped-up Nova's and Dodge Challengers are indicative of the times (the 70s), a time we're supposed to find ourselves reminiscing about. But Tarantino fails to continue on the right path and veers out of control.Cell phones pop up in the second act of Death Proof and pull us away from the first (the second act takes place less than two years after the first). I had to ask myself exactly ""when"" we were. Confusing us further, the Dodge Challenger that the girls go check out is designated ""a classic,"" yet, again, the second act (which is where this happens) takes place only 14 months after the first.Kurt Russell's Stuntman Mike is creepy and funny, and it is his hysterically frightening performance that pulls Death Proof up a notch. His stalking of the pretty girls is spooky, while his later encounters with them are laughable ...and sometimes sexy.The car crash scenes involving the classic Dodges is sure to make MOPAR owners cringe, each crunch of metal on metal eliciting a screeching quality from the cars themselves and those who love these rare vehicles.The girls in both episodes are great looking gals: Zoe Bell, Rosario Dawson (A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints), Vanessa Ferlito (24), Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Tracie Toms (The Devil Wears Prada), Rose McGowan, Jordan Ladd, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (BOBBY) round out the leggy women whom Kurt Russell's character harasses ...but not the way he intended in the end.This is a modestly entertaining film, if only for its sentimental value for those who spent time at the drive-in a few decades ago, or for Kurt Russell fans. If you're a diehard Tarantino-ite, you might find it enjoyable as well. But for mainstream audiences, this one might crash and burn.(NOTE: This is only a review of half of the GRINDHOUSE film, which, for some reason, was divided into two separate DVDs when released.

1079721,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B000R7HY0K,Boss Fan,"[6, 9]","Yes it sucks they are releasing Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's films separately.  And yes it sucks most of us will more than likely end up shelling out more dough for either the theatrical version of ""Grindhouse,"" or some form of special edition package that, even if doesn't recombine the films the way they were in their glorious theatrical release, combines these two movies in some fashion - and gives us back the faux trailers, which were just as much a reason to see ""Grindhouse"" as either of the films themselves.""Grindhouse"" was an experience.  That was the whole point of the project.  Bigger than just seeing a double feature, the creators wanted their audience to experience the exploitation pictures of the 70s, many of which inspired them to become the directors they are today, in all their over-the-top glory.Because the film was too long, too violent and released on Easter weekend, people just didn't get it, didn't want to see a couple of grainy, odd 70's exploitation style flicks (they weren't hits then either, and that's the whole point), it was rated `R' and largely off-limits to its target audience, or because the promos for the film so heavily focused on something as admittedly strange as a stripper with a machine gun leg - there are several theories - ""Grindhouse"" disappointed in theatres.It is perhaps because of that we are now getting the films released separately and the experience has been, for the most part, broken up and abandoned.  Gone are those terrific trailers, though they admittedly would have seemed out of place as individual special features on just one the films; and gone is the thrill of what was a three-plus-hour, down and dirty, drive in spectacular.  Who knows if this decision was meant to recoup lost funds in order to release more versions down the road, or if the two films were always planned to live on their own after theaters, like any film that was part of a double feature during its theatrical release.As I said, this is not the way I would prefer to relive ""Grindhouse,"" and I sympathize with those who would bash these two DVDs because releasing them separately not only distorts and truncates the experience, but this decision feels like it will ultimately prove to be a cash-grab by the studio when, six months down the line, they decide to release another version.  But the fact is, the ""Grindhouse"" films are still great and work well on their own.  Just because they are no longer a double feature doesn't mean each doesn't accomplish what it sets out to do expertly well. And realistically, this type of separate release makes sense in that these really are two separate films, not one long one.  But I loved ""Grindhouse"" in its entirety so much that I was looking forward to reliving the experience over and over, and I envisioned it becoming one of those staple movies the next generation watches behind their parents backs during sleep-overs and such.Well, shoulda, woulda, coulda.  That's not the way, at least for now, the films will be released.  And my own hopes for the film's legacy are not what I am supposed to be reviewing.Nearly as much as debating this releasing format, people have been debating which half of ""Grindhouse"" is the best - Tarantino's or Rodriguez's.  I will admit right off that I found much more to savor, as I always do, in Tarantino's film, ""Death Proof"".  Some have dismissed it as too talky or too boring or not the ""slasher"" film it was presented to be (though I don't recall being promised anything specific from the movie before its release).  It is first and foremost a hot rod thriller ala ""Vanishing Point"".  Cars, stunts, menacing characters - both evil and anti-heroes - and thrilling chases are the point of this vehicle.  As usual Tarantino doesn't just mimic the films and filmmakers he idolizes, but he raises the bar and does all the old stuff in a new, interesting and many times in a shockingly audacious way.  And the stunts in this flick are not only spectacular, but they are real; and I'll take that over CGI and camera trickery any day.Which brings us to ""Planet Terror.""Yes Robert Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" is the flashier, showier, more action-packed entry here, and just because I'm in the ""Death Proof"" camp doesn't mean I didn't love what Rodriguz did with this zombie throwback.  As both spectacle and parody, ""Planet Terror"" is big, loud and fun.  It has a great cast, some surprising cameos, and tons of great lines.  I think the problem I had with ""Planet Terror"" is that it was a zombie movie.  Not because it is a zombie movie (I love zombie movies), but because there have been so many lately and a lot of them have already been presented in a hip, self-winking manor as if they were already sending up old-school, schlocky 70's zombie movies.  Because of that, I always felt like I knew where ""Planet Terror"" was going and I was never that thrilled or gripped with suspense.  The movie managed to have some big surprises here and there and plenty of individual great scenes and moments.  I would never call it dull, or bad, uninteresting or anything other than expertly done - as I said, I liked this film too, it's just that by comparison, I think Tarantino offered up the more interesting film.But, to each his own.  The criticisms for films like this - and with the goals these guys have in mind, which is really to deliver a piece of hopped-up nostalgia - are relative and negligible.  Too criticize ""Planet Terror"" for some of the things I did one could argue is missing the point.  The whole reason for these movies is to honor and revisit the over-the-top junk that these films were.  It that regard - and in terms pure entertainment and bang for the buck - these films both out do themselves.  But, as they say, I likes what I likes and ""Death Proof"" was more my style.  More ambitious and less obvious in its thrills, the movie builds a sense of dread and it gets that feeling of 70s cinema just right, from the opening shot and title cards, to its gasp-educing, thrillingly abrupt conclusion.  Kurt Russel is flat-out fantastic and real-life Tarantino stunt-woman Zoe Bell is a discovery and revelation.  As always with QT, this movie is dialog-heavy.  I savor his stuff.  If you don't, I can see why the movie may play like less than the sum of its parts for you.  But I love juicy dialog as much as I love the blood and goo that spills and flies out of bodies in movies like ""Planet Terror.""And that is the genius here.By giving us both sides of the coin - two major types and examples of 70s exploitation cinema - ""Grindhouse"" delivered on both a promise and a concept.  No two directors were more suited for the task, and it likely would have failed with any others at the helm.  Now that QT and RR have laid the blueprint, I look forward to seeing what other genre-dabbling directors could do with similar material (like all the guys who contributed those terrific afore-motioned fake trailers - I would definitely pay to see full-film versions of ""Machete,"" ""Thanksgiving,"" and ""Nazi Werewolves of the S.S."").  Sadly, because the films are now split, some of you may not feel the same excitement (and if you didn't see it theatres, for now at least, you won't see any of these trailers).But rest assured, even separated, if you pick up either ""Death Proof"" or ""Planet Terror"" - preferably both (and assuming you know what you are getting into and what these two visionary directors are trying to do) you are in for one hell of ride.  For true film fans or just those in search of something daring, original, and way too entertaining, to miss these two films, or in the case of the fans boycotting their separation:  to avoid buying these two films, is to miss out on a great film experience.  Sure the real experience was better, but buying these separate is hardly a rip-off.  First, both come in jam-packed, two-disc sets with all kinds of bells and whistles, including deleted scenes.  And speaking of deleted scenes, since about a half an hour of each film had to be cut for the theatrical release, had they just released ""Grindhouse"" as we knew it, we would not be seeing the films in their intended entirety.I don't know if that makes up for separating the two, but it is reason enough for fans of these films to rejoice.  Face it.  Had they released ""Grindhouse"" as we knew and loved it, we would still want to see the individual movies in their entirety, so most likely we would have wound up buying two products somewhere along the line anyway. I'm actually hoping somewhere down the line I do indeed get that chance.  No I don't want to see three or four more DVD releases of the individual films, but I'll spend some money on these as they are, for what they are, and the entire ""Grindhouse"" someday.Here's to hoping we get that chance.",5,"Though I'd Prefer Not, Even Seperated, ""Grindhouse"" is Still a Truly Thrilling and Unique Experience.",1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,8819,"['Yes', 'are', 'releasing',

I am, however, an admirer of Quentin Tarantino. I don't worship the ground he treads as so many of his devoted fans do, but I usually like what he does with films (although I think there is a very, very thin line between homage and plain copying at times), especially on the sound side.""Death Proof"" is not among my favourite films though. Kurt Russel is nothing short of amazing as stuntman Mike, the homicidal and death defying petrolhead picking up girls in bars. The rest of the cast also acts well, no doubt about it, and there is a few bits of decent action thrown in the mix as well, but the story is simply too boring. I belong to the crowd who think it is slow, dull, and not at all witty. This, however, may be an added effect of watching it in the cinema right after the actionfilled and hugely amuzing, over the top Rodriguez film ""Planet Terror"", but I think that even when watched on its own, ""Death Proof"" is still a bit bland. The slow pace with which the story unfolds and the concomitant desire to yawn is not entirely justified by the action sequences in the latter third of the movie, which would've been the only reasonable way for this film to redeem itself. Sadly it doesn't happen.If you are a fan of the genre or, to use a pathetic and utterly silly, yet popular term, a Tarantino fanboy, I think you might like it better than I did.

""Death Proof"" bills itself as an homage to those sometimes campy, sometimes scary, sometimes just plain god-awful films that kept us juvenilles entertained through countless six-packs of ill-gotten brew.  ""Messiah of Evil"", ""The Student Nurses"", ""Six Pack Annie""--these are just a few titles that I remember with more affection than they probably deserve.  However, ""Death Proof"" is less an homage, than a ham-handed, self-indulgent ripoff of the genre from Quentin Tarantino, a director whose films have grown steadily worse since his halcyon days of ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"", and ""Jackie Brown"".  The ""Kill Bill"" films, despite great performances from a stellar cast, were ludicrous, overlong, and, eventually, tiresome.  ""Death Proof"" is just plain boring, loaded with so much inane and profane banter between some of the least interesting characters imagineable, that it becomes unwatchable.  I forced myself to sit through it just to make sure I was clear on what I was seeing.  Then, I wanted to throw the DVD into the garbage, where it belongs. Kurt Russell apparently needed a paycheck as he non-acts his way through the poorly conceived role of a stuntman/psycho who hotrods around in his souped up auto, stalking scantily clad cuties who spout dialogue that would insult the intelligence of any average seventh grader.

I enjoyed Kurt Russell and the rest the cast in this fun 70s style horror emulating many of the movies back then like Death Race 2000 made in 1975. Although I didn't find this quite as entertaining as Grindhouse Planet Terror, I still think it is worth at least a rental and for this low low price for this two disc set I went ahead and bought a copy. Russell plays a heartless stunt driver bent on killing women. Unfortunately for him he runs across the wrong group of ladies that want some payback.

This film could have easily been cut down from 2 hours to 40 minutes. I don't understand the long drawn out dialogue scenes with the characters, these scenes are 10-15 minute segments of the characters just talking about nothing.  It doesn't make you emphasize with the characters or grow attached to them.  Quentin Tarantino is a great writer and the way he writes dialogue is like eavesdropping on a real conversation but none of these conversations are interesting. The movie was a real drag until Kurt Russell starts speaking. After 40 minutes into the film, my interest was high but it goes into another lull period until the last 30 minutes.  Also, I didn't understand some of the film techniques the opening credits match a film from the 1970s, however as the film progresses it looks like a modern day film.

DEATH PROOF is trademark Tarantino: Overly long, pretentious strings of dialog that are aimed at indulging the director more so than progressing the plot. The exhausting speeches that these broads deliver never make up for the overall lack of action, and are far less amusing than the director intended them to be. This is especially true when they are coming from a collection of characters that never would possess such finely-tuned powers of articulation. Tarantino is simply setting us up for his now-expected action beats that place an exclamation point at the end of each drawn out piece of exposition. With the exception of a big-name cast, Tarantino comes far closer than Robert Rodriguez in emulating the Exploitation experience during his half of the GRINDHOUSE double-feature. He achieves a gritty realism using fast-paced and explosive car chases that have been have not been tampered with using computer enhancement, which amplifies the excitement and danger. It is in these moments that Tarantino succeeds most, creating the modern equivalent to his own personal favorites VANISHING POINT and DIRTY MARY CRAZY LARRY. It takes so long to finally get to these last-minute thrills that most of the audience has likely checked out already. DEATH PROOF does provide enough momentary satisfaction to make it worth sitting through to the end, however, and the final chase at least adds a heart racing grand finale to an otherwise dull movie.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",3,Death Proof,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1659,"['Eight', 'sexy', 'young', 'women', 'are', 'take', 'ride', 'lives', 'when', 'are', 'stalked', 'predatory', 'stunt', 'driver', 'who', 'car', 'weapon', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'DEATH', 'PROOF', 'DEATH', 'PROOF', 'trademark', 'Tarantino', 'Overly', 'long', 'pretentious', 'strings', 'dialog', 'are', 'aimed', 'indulging', 'director', 'more', 'so', 'progressing', 'plot', 'exhausting', 'speeches', 'broads', 'deliver', 'never', 'make', 'up', 'overall', 'lack', 'action', 'are', 'far', 'less', 'amusing', 'director', 'intended', 'be', 'especially', 'true', 'when', 'are', 'coming', 'collection', 'characters', 'never', 'would', 'possess', 'such', 'finely-tuned', 'powers', 'articulation', 'Tarantino', 'simply', 'setting', 'up', 'now-expected', 'action', 'beats', 'place', 'exclamation', 'point', 'end', 'drawn', 'piece', 'exposition', 'exception', 'big-name', 'cast', 'Tarantino', 'far', 'closer', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'emulating', 'Exploitation', 'experience', 'half', 'GRINDHOUSE', 'double-feature', 'gritty', 'realism', 'using', 'fast-paced', 'explosive', 'car', 'chases', 'have', 'been', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'tampered', 'using', 'computer', 'enhancement', 'excitement', 'danger', 'moments', 'Tarantino', 'most', 'creating', 'modern', 'equivalent', 'own', 'personal', 'favorites', 'VANISHING', 'POINT', 'DIRTY', 'MARY', 'CRAZY', 'LARRY', 'so', 'long', 'finally', 'get', 'last-minute', 'thrills', 'most', 'audience', 'likely', 'checked', 'out', 'already', 'DEATH', 'PROOF', 'provide', 'enough', 'momentary', 'satisfaction', 'make', 'worth', 'sitting', 'end', 'however', 'final', 'chase', 'least', 'heart', 'racing', 'grand', 'finale', 'otherwise', 'dull', 'movie.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof

It's a shame that it couldn't have been marketed better, because it truly was a fun, cinema experience that is difficult to grasp for these two extremely different films.However, Tarantino amazingly one-ups his own brilliance with Death Proof.  The two main reasons this is recommended:  Kurt Russell and Zoe Bell.Kurt Russell turns in a bizarre, and dare I say Oscar-worthy performance as 'Stuntman Mike.' (I have no remote hopes he would ever be considered for a nod, however.  It's not a traditional 'Oscar' role.)  However, he plays a sexy, creepy, evil, spineless madman like no-one's business.And Zoe Bell...if you haven't seen the film, she has 20 minutes near the end that will absolutely blow you away.  The fact it's clear that she did her own stunts will be enough of a thrill.  In a day and age where CGI has made the typical moviegoer very blase, Tarantino finding a stuntwoman who can act, (she has a charm that just jumps out of the screen) her work in this is literally jaw dropping.The film, overall, is just plain fun.  It makes no attempts to deliver a solid plot.  It doesn't pretend to be something it's not.  It's a well-delivered tribute to 70's exploitation/muscle car films.  The ending is one of the best 'pay off's/in jokes' of any you will ever find.  (It's very in-keeping with old grindhouse-type films that were long on ideas but woefully short on budget.  lol).It's got typical, wordy dialogue, the most amazing car chase scene you will EVER likely see, a balls-out performance by Kurt Russell that shows mastery in restraint and outright menace, cool cars, lots of titillation...in short, a great movie to have fun watching!",5,Tarantino reinvents his brilliance!,1191024000,"09 29, 2007",2007,1824,"['First', 'will', 'say', 'missed', 'Death', 'Proof', 'companion', 'Planet', 'Terror', 'Grindhouse', 'package', 'theaters', 'really', 'missed', 'fun', 'cinema', 'experience', 'shame', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'marketed', 'better', 'truly', 'was', 'fun', 'cinema', 'experience', 'difficult', 'grasp', 'two', 'extremely', 'different', 'films.However', 'Tarantino', 'amazingly', 'own', 'brilliance', 'Death', 'Proof', 'two', 'main', 'reasons', 'recommended', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Zoe', 'Bell.Kurt', 'Russell', 'bizarre', 'dare', 'say', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', ""'Stuntman"", 'Mike', 'have', 'remote', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'considered', 'nod', 'however', 'not', 'traditional', ""'Oscar"", 'role', 'However', 'sexy', 'creepy', 'evil', 'spineless', 'madman', 'no-one', 'business.And', 'Zoe', 'Bell', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', '20', 'minutes', 'end', 'will', 'absolutely', 'blow', 'away', 'fact', 'clear', 'did', 'own', 'stunts', 'will', 'be', 'enough', 'thrill', 'day', 'age', 'where', 'CGI', 'made', 'typical', 'moviegoer', 'very', 'blase', 'Tarantino', 'finding', 'stuntwoman', 'who', 'can', 'act', 'charm', 'just', 'screen', 'work', 'literally', 'jaw', 'dropping.The', 'film', 'overall', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'attempts', 'deliver', 'solid', 'plot', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'something', 'not', 'well-delivered', 'tribute', '70', 'exploitation/muscle', 'car', 'films', 'ending', 'one', 'best', ""'pay"", ""off's/in"", 'jokes', 'will', 'ever', 'find', 'very', 'in-keeping', 'old', 'grindhouse-type', 'films', 'were', 'long', 'ideas', 'woefully', 'short', 'budget', 'lol', '.It', 'got', 'typical', 'wordy', 'dialogue', 'most', 'amazing', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'will', 'EVER', 'likely', 'see', 'balls-out', 'performance', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'mastery', 'restraint', 'outright', 'menace', 'cool', 'cars', 'lots', 'titillation', 'short', 'great', 'movie', 'have', 'fun', 'watching']",Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof

1079743,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000R7HY0K,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 3]","There's 2 ways you can see it when you watch a film like Death Proof or Planet Terror on their own, either see it as a separated half from a larger whole or a film onto itself without its companion to support it. Either way you look at it, it's probably the most disappointing of Quentin's films and probably the lesser half of the Grindhouse double bill. There is a couple of things to recommend about it but for me, this was simply an okay movie whether attached or on its own.Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) has a real fixation with girls and the way he gets out his obsession is ramming into them with his ""death proof"" car, a car fitted for dangerous stunts and crashes. Once he's finished with the first trio of girls (Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd, Sydney Tamiaa Poitier), he goes after movie set workers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rosario Dawson, Zoe Bell, Tracie Thoms).That's pretty much the entire film in a nutshell and it's kind of hard to get into detail and specifics because there isn't any. Mind you this film is a tribute to 70's era movies so you can't really be too criticizing of a film like this. But then again you watch the film and find much to nitpick. For one, the film is just way too long yet it's probably one of his shortest movies if you count Kill Bill films as one gigantic one. While in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, those natural conversations about Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" and Royale with Cheese burgers felt realistic and even fascinating to hear, in this film these chicks just talk and talk meaninglessly. While the payoffs are exciting, the loooong leadup to them feel frustrating.As a guy, it's kind of fun to watch a film which is essentially dominated mainly by women. Some of them fair better (Dawson, McGowan and Winstead, mainly cause she's just so cute) while some (Bell, Thoms, Poitier) are either annoying and wish somebody would tell them to shut up or they're cute but little else of substance. But the main draw of course is Kurt Russell. Quentin sure likes to cast great leading men who deliver excellent performances like Robert Forster in Jackie Brown or David Carradine in Kill Bill and again with Russell who plays menace and cool, easygoing demeanors.Ultimately, you have to watch Death Proof with a feeling like you're missing the second half, same if you were to watch Planet Terror without seeing this after it. While it's obvious they were separated for money reasons, it's hard to tell if they're good films on their own or not enough in one to warrant a watch.

Slabbing the 'grindhouse' name in order to authenticate its manor may of hurt its success, but it really is a decent worthwhile film. Movies of this nature are becoming rarer, and many are often utter garbage. Always nice to see a decent one.Character development actually happens, and slow moments are only to further develop characters.

Four would-be victims babble and drink and do lap dances and flirt and smoke pot and tease guys and tease each other, awesome vintage tunes playing on an old jukebox, and the most interesting element: a look as if it were a cheaply made ""grindhouse"" flick, with spots on the screen and visible mistakes and sound problems and jump-cuts and skips as if it were a broken record. The middle of the film provides a great death scene introducing a great new killer: a hotrod wheeling freddy kruger and now we're ready with our beltbuckles on to have a heck of a ride. But then... something happens. The spots on the film go away. All of the sudden, everything is clear. Too clear. There is no more of that grindhouse cheap movie look from the first half. And instead of now rolling with this new bad guy we get introduced to four new girls, more cleancut and talky, and annoying. Too much dialog and hey, where's the bad guy? Where's his car? We get to see it once during a somewhat boring scene that provides a bridge between both parts of the film, but then that's it until we see him once in a diner, and then at the very end. Tarantino worked up a great course for the first half and then served us a very bad dessert. The killer turns out to be a useless crybaby, the new would-be victims turn out to be karate babe heroes, the car, which the movie is named after, is hardly even shown, and we, the audience, has to suffer through it. But the thing that blows me away is how QT totally abandoned the cheap grindhouse look that made the first half so cool, and then left us with characters who we not only dislike, but who talk so much there's no time to think. QT, you screwed up a good thing. Must be all that money you got in the bank, or something. You need to get hungry again buddy. I was enjoying this movie, and then ended up feeling robbed, and betrayed. Imagine Freddy Kruger or Jason Vorhees or Michael Myers or Norman Bates or the shark in JAWS absent through most of the last half of the films in which they ""star"" as killers.

I mean, Russell's great and all...but REALLY?  So naturally, when I saw ""Grindhouse"" in theaters (yes, world, I was one of the few) I came in ready to critique. What I found was a surprise (although, in retrospect, not much of one)--Russell pretty much reinvents himself here.  Snake Pliskin and Wyatt Earp no more; here we have Stuntman Mike, who goes around stalking and killing beautiful young women.  That's basically the movie.The great thing about grindhouse cinema is that plot is irrelevant; we come for over-the-top performances, outrageous scenes, a bit of sex and bruality, and not much else.  Of course, this is a Tarantino film, so you DO get something else--great acting, writing, and directing, not to mention a killer (oh dear, a pun!) soundtrack.  I know a lot of people will be unhappy with this movie, as it takes about forty-five minutes for anything to really happen...but when it happens, IT HAPPENS.  And face it--up 'til that point, and ever afterward, it's totally cool.A word about the release...yes, I am disappointed that ""Grindhouse"" was not released in full.  Not surprised, though; I left the theater and told the people I was with that there was no way in hell the movie was going to be released as a single unit.  I mean, we're talking Tarantino and Rodriguez here.  What do you expect them to do--follow the rules?  ""Grindhouse"" was a THEATRICAL event; I would love to see it again in its entirety, but the effect would be totally lost on a home television set.  Yes, it's a minor tragedy that we don't have the fake previews; and I think it's a shame that some of the ""lost"" scenes were re-instated (although I'm giddy as a schoolboy that the scratches weren't edited out; thank God for small favors).  But take ""Death Proof"" as what it is--a great thriller, another in a long line of Tarantino cult-classics.

1079754,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B000R7HY0K,Dave. K,"[12, 16]","A lot of the reviews here seem to be people upset at the split on DVD. I'm gonna give my best at reviewing the movie and ignoring the split on DVD.As stated before Death Proof is one half of Grindhouse, which was split upon the DVD release. It's a throwback to 70s exploitation flicks. Death Proof has sparked a pretty big debate among viewers; some love it and hail as a masterpiece others find it slow and boring and a waste of time.As a fan of exploitation cinema I personally wouldn't put Death Proof with that genre of film. While Death Proof is paying homage to those styles of films it really doesn't feel like one. About the only thing that makes it feel like a 70s exploitation flick is the look of the movie at least in the first half. The lines going through the picture the picture jumps. I really enjoyed that in the first half.A lot of those movies do indeed look like that well before they are restored onto DVD so in that sense Tarantino really captures that vibe, but just not with the actual movie. As for the movie itself I thought it was excellent. I'll admit thus far I have enjoyed everything Quentin Tarantino has done so I was quite pumped for Death Proof.As good as a director Quentin is what really makes him stand-out is his dialogue. I think even the biggest of Quentin Tarantino fans will agree while he is a talented director; he's a much better writer.Death Proof is your typical Quentin Tarantino movie with the great writing he is known for among his fans. Though with that said I do believe there were some problems. I loved the first half of the movie; in my opinion it was some of Tarantino's best writing of his career. Sure it's no Pulp Fiction, but I found it well-written and damn entertaining.The characters were well-written and again your typical Tarantino characters. But the 2nd half changes focus on the characters and that's when things get a tad bit messy.The biggest complaint with Death Proof was it was too slow and too much talking. I personally never once in the first half found it slow or boring. The writing was sharp and I found the tension building. We know something was gonna happen sooner or later and the anticipation of that I felt worked amazingly.But the 2nd half is when I did start to find things slowing down and I didn't feel that tension. Honestly, the 2nd half felt like somebody trying to be Quentin Tarantino. I never found Death Proof boring, but I have to admit I wasn't into the 2nd half nearly as much as I was the first half.The characters just in my opinion didn't work as well and again I personally felt as if the 2nd half was written by someone trying to copy Tarantino. The 2nd half is by no means bad; it just doesn't work quite as well and in some areas does drag a bit. It doesn't take a way from the fun of the movie though.The car chase scenes at the end were excellent and that is something we don't see much of today in film. And when we do normally its CGI and even when it's not CG when we do get it I don't know I just find it doesn't work.Quentin Tarantino knows his stuff when it comes to film the guy is pretty much a walking encyclopedia of knowledge when it comes to movies. So not much of a surprise the car chase scenes cam out as wonderful as they did; the scenes were suspenseful and action packed and very much made up for some of the slower spots in the 2nd half.The cast was great here. The girls are all very sexy and excellent and Rose McGowan pretty much steals the show from them. But the real stand-out of the movie is Kurt Russell.I have always been a fan of Kurt Russell and this was his best role in years. He's played a couple of Iconic characters and I think Stuntman Mike is another one to his list.I would very much recommend this flick to fans of Tarantino; if you like his work thus far odds are you'll really dig Death Proof. But for those who aren't fans of QT I doubt this movie will change your opinion of him.Death Proof is a well acted and made movie that has plenty of thrilling and very fun moments. While it doesn't really capture the 70s exploitation vibe Death Proof is a must see.",4,Death Proof,1190160000,"09 19, 2007",2007,4111,"['lot', 'reviews', 'here', 'seem', 'be', 'people', 'upset', 'split', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'gon', 'give', 'best', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'ignoring', 'split', 'DVD.As', 'stated', 'Death', 'Proof', 'one', 'half', 'Grindhouse', 'was', 'split', 'DVD', 'release', 'throwback', '70s', 'exploitation', 'flicks', 'Death', 'Proof', 'sparked', 'pretty', 'big', 'debate', 'viewers', 'love', 'hail', 'masterpiece', 'others', 'find', 'slow', 'boring', 'waste', 'time.As', 'fan', 'exploitation', 'cinema', 'personally', 'would', ""n't"", 'put', 'Death', 'Proof', 'genre', 'film', 'Death', 'Proof', 'paying', 'homage', 'styles', 'films', 'really', ""n't"", 'feel', 'one', 'only', 'thing', 'feel', '70s', 'exploitation', 'flick', 'look', 'movie', 'least', 'first', 'half', 'lines', 'going', 'picture', 'picture', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'half.A', 'lot', 'movies', 'do', 'indeed', 'look', 'well', 'are', 'restored', 'DVD', 'so', 'sense', 'Tarantino', 'really', 'vibe', 'just', 'not', 'actual', 'movie', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'thus', 'far', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'everything', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'done', 'so', 'was', 'quite', 'pumped', 'Death', 'Proof.As', 'good', 'director', 'Quentin', 'what', 'really', 'stand-out', 'dialogue', 'think', 'even', 'biggest', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'fans', 'will', 'agree', 'talented', 'director', 'much', 'better', 'writer.Death', 'Proof', 'typical', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'movie', 'great', 'writing', 'known', 'fans', 'said', 'do', 'believe', 'were', 'problems', 'loved', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'opinion', 'was', 'Tarantino', 'best', 'writing', 'career', 'Sure', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'found', 'well-written', 'entertaining.The', 'characters', 'were', 'well-written', 'again', 'typical', 'Tarantino', 'characters', '2nd', 'half', 'changes', 'focus', 'characters', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'tad', 'bit', 'messy.The', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'Death', 'Proof', 'was', 'was', 'too', 'slow', 'too', 'much', 'talking', 'personally', 'never', 'once', 'first', 'half', 'found', 'slow', 'boring', 'writing', 'was', 'sharp', 'found', 'tension', 'building', 'know', 'something', 'was', 'gon', 'happen', 'sooner', 'later', 'anticipation', 'felt', 'worked', '2nd', 'half', 'when', 'did', 'start', 'find', 'things', 'slowing', 'down', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'tension', 'Honestly', '2nd', 'half', 'felt', 'somebody', 'trying', 'be', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'never', 'found', 'Death', 'Proof', 'boring', 'have', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", '2nd', 'half', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'first', 'half.The', 'characters', 'just', 'opinion', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'again', 'personally', 'felt', '2nd', 'half', 'was', 'written', 'someone', 'trying', 'copy', 'Tarantino', '2nd', 'half', 'means', 'bad', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'areas', 'drag', 'bit', ""n't"", 'take', 'way', 'fun', 'movie', 'though.The', 'car', 'chase', 'scenes', 'end', 'were', 'excellent', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'today', 'film', 'when', 'do', 'normally', 'CGI', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'CG', 'when', 'do', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'find', ""n't"", 'work.Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'stuff', 'when', 'film', 'guy', 'pretty', 'much', 'walking', 'encyclopedia', 'knowledge', 'when', 'movies', 'So', 'not', 'much', 'surprise', 'car', 'chase', 'scenes', 'cam', 'out', 'as', 'wonderful', 'did', 'scenes', 'were', 'suspenseful', 'action', 'packed', 'very', 'much', 'made', 'up', 'slower', 'spots', '2nd', 'half.The', 'cast', 'was', 'great', 'here', 'girls', 'are', 'very', 'sexy', 'excellent', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'pretty', 'much', 'steals', 'show', 'real', 'stand-out', 'movie', 'Kurt', 'Russell.I', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'was', 'best', 'role', 'years', 'played', 'couple', 'Iconic', 'characters', 'think', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'one', 'list.I', 'would', 'very', 'much', 'recommend', 'flick', 'fans', 'Tarantino', 'work', 'thus', 'far', 'odds', 'are', ""'ll"", 'really', 'dig', 'Death', 'Proof', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'fans', 'QT', 'doubt', 'movie', 'will', 'change', 'opinion', 'him.Death', 'Proof', 'well', 'acted', 'made', 'movie', 'plenty', 'thrilling', 'very', 'fun', 'moments', ""n't"", 'really', 'capture', '70s', 'exploitation', 'vibe', 'Death', 'Proof', 'must', 'see']",Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof
1079755,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B000R7HY0K,David Baldwin,"[7, 13]","I was looking forward to seeing ""Grindhouse"" on my birthday.  When I got to the local cinema I found out they pulled it.  The given explanation was the Virginia Tech massacre but methinks it was audience apathy.  I ended up sipping wine coolers with my wife and watching ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" at home.  In retrospect that was a more pleasurable experience then watching ""Death Proof"".  I can't fathom it but Quentin Tarantino lost it here.  Maybe the flick would be best appreciated in it's truncated form in the context of ""Grindhouse"".  Maybe not.  Tarantino cites classic drive-in fare from the seventies as ""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry"", ""Vanishing Point"" and ""Big Wednesday"".  Somebody should inform Quentin that the makers of those films just went out and made good movies without a hint of self consciousness.  In an interview with ""Entertainment Weekly"" Tarantino said he employed Kurt Russell to get him back to the Snake Plissken kind of roles.  Could have fooled me because Russell is virtually wasted here.  Tarantino's knack for writing crisp, witty dialogue is virtually absent here.  I heard a better reference to ""B.J. and the Bear"" on ""My Name is Earl"" the other night.  The only time I remotely chuckled was from a cell phone ring tone that referenced ""Kill Bill"".  The film's lone redeeming qualities are engaging performances from Rosario Dawson and Kiwi actress-stuntwoman Zoe Bell and one half decent car chase.  I have never disliked a Tarantino film until this one.  Here the self-indulgent qualities that were muted in his other films come out in full force.

Trashy biker films, zombies, blacksploitation etc. Death Proof is a tribute to those B movies. It's also yet another example from Tarantino how a singular character can drive a movie forward. In this case, the character is 'Stuntman Mike.' Not that the other characters are bad, but Mike stands out.The film is deliberately aged giving it a worn out look. There are jumps and bad edits and parts where the sound is faulty. All of which is in keeping with old, degraded B-films.I also like that there was very little CGI used. The stunts where all done with real cars and stuntmen/women.Deathproof is, in my opinion, the last of the dialogue-character-driven Tarantino films. Pity Tarantino thinks it's his worst film.

Most of the people who tell me that they don't like it complain that there's too much dialogue, but there are three reasons for this: 1. It makes the crash scene that much better of a payoff. 2. Tarantino meant this to be like a true grindhouse movie, and in those types of movies there was a lot of useless dialogue because they didn't have a big budget so much of the movie was dialogue to fill up running time to make it a feature length film. In this aspect, I felt he stayed very true to form but a lot of people wouldn't get this. 3. Even if there is a lot of dialogue, it's all really interesting dialogue. Kind of like the book Catcher in the Rye. It isn't really about anything but it's still a good read because the way it's written is so interesting.Picture Quality:Now when you hear about something like Death Proof on blu-ray, you might immediately think it's pointless because the whole point of the movie was to look ""bad"". The film was purposely meant to look like it was played too many times. Scratches everywhere, film spliced all over the place. I will still say the first half of the film benefits really well from the high def treatment. It looks kind of soft but the colors recieve a great boost. But where the movie truly shines is the second half with the second group of girls. I don't know if most people who have seen Death Proof bothered to notice how the film style changes drastically in the second half because they were so into the movie at the time, but it no longer has the ""grindhouse"" look after the movie switches to Lebanon, Tennessee. I will just say the second half of the movie on blu-ray makes the movie worth the purchase. It's gorgeous. Colors are splendid, and the images are razor sharp. I think the high point for me was a close up of Rosario Dawson in the car where she finally starts to smile while Zoey is tied to the hood of the car that just hits with a ""BLEEM!"" I can't describe it. It was just a  ""BLEEM!"" that resonated. The second half of this movie is like running naked through the rain. It's like drinking an ice cold beer while having a hot shower after a long, sh***y day at work. It's movies like this on blu-ray that will give you the hugest high def d*** alive and proudly boast about it.",5,Better on blu-ray than you would expect,1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,2313,"['Actual', 'movie', 'Death', 'Proof', 'hit', 'miss', 'people', 'Most', 'people', 'who', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'dialogue', 'are', 'three', 'reasons', '1', 'crash', 'scene', 'much', 'better', 'payoff', '2', 'Tarantino', 'meant', 'be', 'true', 'grindhouse', 'movie', 'types', 'movies', 'was', 'lot', 'useless', 'dialogue', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'budget', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'dialogue', 'fill', 'up', 'running', 'time', 'make', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'aspect', 'felt', 'stayed', 'very', 'true', 'form', 'lot', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', '3', 'Even', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'really', 'interesting', 'dialogue', 'Kind', 'book', 'Catcher', 'Rye', ""n't"", 'really', 'anything', 'still', 'good', 'read', 'way', 'written', 'so', 'interesting.Picture', 'Quality', 'Now', 'when', 'hear', 'something', 'Death', 'Proof', 'blu-ray', 'might', 'immediately', 'think', 'pointless', 'whole', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'look', 'bad', 'film', 'was', 'purposely', 'meant', 'look', 'was', 'played', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'Scratches', 'everywhere', 'film', 'spliced', 'place', 'will', 'still', 'say', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'benefits', 'really', 'well', 'high', 'def', 'treatment', 'kind', 'soft', 'colors', 'recieve', 'great', 'boost', 'where', 'movie', 'truly', 'shines', 'second', 'half', 'second', 'group', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Death', 'Proof', 'bothered', 'notice', 'how', 'film', 'style', 'changes', 'drastically', 'second', 'half', 'were', 'so', 'movie', 'time', 'no', 'longer', 'grindhouse', 'look', 'movie', 'Lebanon', 'Tennessee', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'blu-ray', 'movie', 'purchase', 'gorgeous', 'Colors', 'are', 'splendid', 'images', 'are', 'razor', 'sharp', 'think', 'high', 'point', 'was', 'close', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'car', 'where', 'finally', 'smile', 'Zoey', 'tied', 'hood', 'car', 'just', 'BLEEM', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'was', 'just', 'BLEEM', 'resonated', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'running', 'naked', 'rain', 'drinking', 'ice', 'cold', 'beer', 'having', 'hot', 'shower', 'long', 'sh***y', 'day', 'work', 'movies', 'blu-ray', 'will', 'give', 'hugest', 'high', 'def', 'd***', 'alive', 'proudly', 'boast']",Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof

Hmmm . . . too bad I guess.===========================================================================Now, let's get started on the review: This is a movie which relies on excessive cursing to carry most of the dialog, and it got to a point that it was no longer cool but just annoying.

It is clear from Kill Bill volumes 1 and 2 that Tarantino has a tendency to pander to his own whims in a way that is cinematically damaging. However in 'Death Proof' this pandering to whims turns into full blown self indulgence.Most cinema goers have long been fans of the marvellous Tarantino dialogue that became the stuff of legends during the days of 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs'. However here that exact same dialogue is used as a crutch to drag audiences through a film that lacks anything more solid.One thing that becomes patently obvious among this ubiquitous dialogue style is that Tarantino can only really write one type of female character. Although the icy-gazed, sass-mouthed, cold-hearted young woman character has served him well in many movies, it becomes somewhat tedious when multiplied by 7 in 'Death Proof'.The central plotline would be a lot more compelling if it were not basically the same 45 minute plotline shown twice. It must also be said that there are too many frills and not enough body to it. To disappointed Tarantino fans I would say don't worry.

1079779,A3JD8FDS3CO3GH,B000R7HY0K,FairiesWearBoots8272,"[0, 1]","Once again Quentin Tarantino has taken several movie genres and smashed them together into something completely unique and original. Death Proof is an ingenious, if slowly-paced combination of slasher movie, car chase thriller and revenge flick. Just when you think you know where it's going, it veers off in a different direction (sometimes literally). For Tarantino fans, Death Proof will be absolutely delightful if you can get past the slow pace and extreme talkiness. Some people were bothered by the long stretches of dialog, but really that's what a slasher movie consists of. You meet the characters, then they chat about BS for about half an hour, then there's a kill. If you don't get to peek into the characters lives, you're not going to care about them when they are in jeopardy. The girls' performances and Tarantino's dialog make it far from intolerable.All the Tarantino trademarks are present in Death Proof: stunning direction, shots of girls' feet, excellent use of music with old obscure pop songs, lots of dialog, and strong female heroines, but this time he throws a few new things into the mix. The setup of a slasher movie, Austin Texas flavor, and an amazing car chase. And if this movie doesn't make a star out of the great Zoe Bell, then there's truly no justice in the world. She is amazing. Zoe Bell alone makes Death Proof worth watching. She's just adorable and her climactic scene will have you on the edge of your seat. I must mention Kurt Russell too. This movie must be his best performance in ages. His Stuntman Mike is both exceedingly charming and frightening.The DVD features the extended cut of Death Proof that premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. As for the longer cut itself, I feel that it's definitely better than the shorter cut. There are several great new scenes that make the film an even richer experience. Kurt Russell, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Vanessa Ferlito are all given more screentime which I think is a very good thing. Michael Parks' scene is longer, also a very good thing. There are more great details like the second group of girls' stop at a convenience store with Stuntman Mike not far behind. The longer film feels more complete to me, it feels more like a whole film. However, those that didn't like the shorter Death Proof certainly won't like the longer film any more.As for the hubbub surrounding the DVD release, I say nonsense. It's probably a consequence of the film's low box office gross. Although Tarantino planned to release his preferred cut of Death Proof separately all along. I'm happy to be able to see Death Proof without having to sit through Planet Terror first. I'd much rather own the longer cut of the movie than just the theatrical version. I think Death Proof will work even better as a stand-alone feature film. I loved the theatrical movie but it worked best at the movie theater. Grindhouse just won't be quite the same on the small screen. So it makes sense to release Planet Terror and Death Proof separately. Perhaps someday in the future people will realize that they missed a completely unique and exciting moviegoing experience and the film will be rereleased in theaters. Until then, I'm happy to have the DVDs of the two movies.",5,"Baby, It's You",1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,3233,"['Once', 'again', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'taken', 'several', 'movie', 'genres', 'smashed', 'together', 'something', 'completely', 'unique', 'original', 'Death', 'Proof', 'ingenious', 'slowly-paced', 'combination', 'slasher', 'movie', 'car', 'chase', 'thriller', 'revenge', 'flick', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'off', 'different', 'direction', 'sometimes', 'literally', 'Tarantino', 'fans', 'Death', 'Proof', 'will', 'be', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'can', 'get', 'slow', 'pace', 'extreme', 'talkiness', 'people', 'were', 'bothered', 'long', 'stretches', 'dialog', 'really', 'what', 'slasher', 'movie', 'meet', 'characters', 'then', 'chat', 'BS', 'about', 'hour', 'then', 'kill', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'peek', 'characters', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'care', 'when', 'are', 'jeopardy', 'girls', 'performances', 'Tarantino', 'dialog', 'make', 'far', 'intolerable.All', 'Tarantino', 'trademarks', 'are', 'present', 'Death', 'Proof', 'stunning', 'direction', 'shots', 'girls', 'feet', 'excellent', 'use', 'music', 'old', 'obscure', 'pop', 'songs', 'lots', 'dialog', 'strong', 'female', 'heroines', 'time', 'few', 'new', 'things', 'mix', 'setup', 'slasher', 'movie', 'Austin', 'Texas', 'flavor', 'amazing', 'car', 'chase', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'star', 'great', 'Zoe', 'Bell', 'then', 'truly', 'justice', 'world', 'amazing', 'Zoe', 'Bell', 'alone', 'Death', 'Proof', 'watching', 'just', 'adorable', 'climactic', 'scene', 'will', 'have', 'edge', 'seat', 'must', 'mention', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'too', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'best', 'performance', 'ages', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'exceedingly', 'charming', 'frightening.The', 'DVD', 'extended', 'cut', 'Death', 'Proof', 'premiered', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'longer', 'cut', 'feel', 'definitely', 'better', 'shorter', 'cut', 'are', 'several', 'great', 'new', 'scenes', 'make', 'film', 'even', 'richer', 'experience', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'Vanessa', 'Ferlito', 'are', 'given', 'more', 'screentime', 'think', 'very', 'good', 'thing', 'Michael', 'Parks', 'scene', 'longer', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'thing', 'are', 'more', 'great', 'details', 'second', 'group', 'girls', 'stop', 'convenience', 'store', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'not', 'far', 'longer', 'film', 'feels', 'more', 'complete', 'more', 'whole', 'film', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'shorter', 'Death', 'Proof', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'longer', 'film', 'more.As', 'hubbub', 'surrounding', 'DVD', 'release', 'say', 'nonsense', 'probably', 'consequence', 'film', 'low', 'box', 'office', 'gross', 'Tarantino', 'planned', 'release', 'preferred', 'cut', 'Death', 'Proof', 'separately', ""'m"", 'happy', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'Death', 'Proof', 'having', 'sit', 'Planet', 'Terror', 'first', ""'d"", 'much', 'rather', 'own', 'longer', 'cut', 'movie', 'just', 'theatrical', 'version', 'think', 'Death', 'Proof', 'will', 'work', 'even', 'better', 'stand-alone', 'feature', 'film', 'loved', 'theatrical', 'movie', 'worked', 'best', 'movie', 'theater', 'Grindhouse', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'quite', 'same', 'small', 'screen', 'sense', 'release', 'Planet', 'Terror', 'Death', 'Proof', 'separately', 'Perhaps', 'someday', 'future', 'people', 'will', 'realize', 'missed', 'completely', 'unique', 'exciting', 'moviegoing', 'experience', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'rereleased', 'theaters', 'then', ""'m"", 'happy', 'have', 'DVDs', 'two', 'movies']",Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof

Terror was no doubt packed full of the craziest action and hilarious scenes but feels long and gets overwhelming towards the end. At least that's how it felt to me personally. However, ""Death Proof"" has so much style and the pay off at the end is tremendous. It's the most fun I've had at the movies since Jackass 2. The opening sequence of ""Death Proof"" was filmed in such a cool yet simple way. I loved the way Tarantino used the music and the low shots of the woman character's legs walking. I'm not saying it was technically good or anything else some film boy will scold me for implying. I'm just saying I thought the whole style of the film was, not only of course very Tarantino, but also just had such a cool style and flair to it.I just purchased the DVD through Amazon and I'm looking forward to getting into the special features. It has over 5 Behind the Scene videos that I'm sure Tarantino packed with entertaining material. I do want the trailers and ""Planet Terror"" as one whole package just like other people on here complaining, but I'm cool with waiting to see those portions of Grindhouse once they are released together as a whole experience again in the future.

1079786,A2W3QN3Q2BGFSG,B000R7HY0K,G.F. Snell III,"[1, 2]","Admittedly, Quentin Tarantino can be irritating. He's a weak-jawed geek who believes his own press clippings (and thinks he's tough guy because he makes action flicks). And he's also a screamer - an actor who can't stop shouting on screen.But I've never met him, so maybe I'm being presumptive.Because whether Tarantino is a jackass doesn't matter. The man makes dynamite movies - from ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) to ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994). He makes those guilty pleasure flicks filled with great lines, fast action, and superb acting. As a director he yanks the gusto out of his actors. John Travolta should send him Christmas cards for saving his career.That brings us to ""Grindhouse"" (2007).All the credit can't go to Tarantino, of course, as he co-directed ""Grindhouse"" with the talented Robert Rodriguez. But the movie is an achievement of writing, directing, and acting.The concept is brilliant - a throwback to the 1970s drive-in B-movies (called grindhouses in the industry). The movie meshes two exploitation classics: a serial killer revenge flick and a zombie splatter fest. Sprinkle in some pop references and ironic dialog with a dash of dark humor and you've got a roller coaster ride of a movie.The movie looks like a film pulled out of a rusty canister - complete with missing reels and burnt celluloid. There are fake trailers for movies with names like ""Machete"" and ""Werewolf Women of the SS.""But the movie flopped. It brought in a meager $25 million and cost more than double that to make. There was just too much going on in ""Grindhouse."" For 191 minutes there were the two movies, the trailers, and an intermission. It was a glorious effort - but it was just asking too much of the viewer.But all that's been fixed with the DVD release of Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" and Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror."" Rather than sawed-off versions - we get full length features. Both movies are better off longer.Death Proof""Death Proof"" is the best Kurt Russell movie in long time - one where he gets his Snake Plisskin mojo back. He plays Stuntman Mike, a charming viper of a misogynist serial killer. Stuntman Mike - gored face and all - has a black ""death proof"" car with a cage inside it. He likes to put women in the cage and then drive really fast, braking, and cornering until he's basically turned his female passengers into hamburger.This snippet of dialog sings:Mike: Well, Pam, which way are you going, left or right?Pam: Right.Mike: Oh, that's too bad.Pam: Why?Mike: Because it was a 50-50 shot on whether you'd be going left or right. You see we're both going left. You could have just as easily been going left, too. And if that was the case, it would have been a while before you started getting scared. But since you're going the other way, I'm afraid you're going have to start getting scared - immediately.Stuntman Mike then proceeds to give Pam a ride she'll never forget (or, in fact, survive). ""Death Proof"" is actually two movies. The first half is about how Stuntman Mike stalks, charms, and then murders a group of four female friends.The next half he's up to his old tricks with another group of four women. But two of these women are Hollywood stunt drivers - and they know how to fight (and drive) back. The ending is worthy of any revenge flick in existence.But what makes the film work? Character and dialog. Two things that were given short shift in the original version.Planet Terror""Planet Terror"" is Rodriguez's homage to the gore-infused horror movie. The plot is secondary (it has something to do with a chemical being unleashed and turning the innocent into flesh-eating zombies). There're lots and lots of blood - and black humor (Jeff Fahey as a barbeque chef is outrageous).Rodriguez shines with the small moments - the love scene between the protagonists (Freddie Rodriguez and Rose McGowan) is a high in low-brow. McGowan's character has had her leg severed and a broom handle shoved into her stump as a replacement. Ridiculous camp at it's best.Then there's Bruce Willis in a self-parody. There's Freddy Rodriguez mounting a mini-motor scooter as he zips down the highway firing bullets into the heads of zombies.

His usually quirky, interesting dialogue just wasn't there this time. And to top it off, the characters were incredibly annoying. Not a good mix. He already makes the current day equivalent of grindhouse movies. Now, when he tries to recreate those clunky films, he fails.

The beginning soundtrack sounds like it may have come from the film,Village of the Giants(1965).However, the Grindhouse story is set in 2007. The girls, Arlene, Shana and Julia (Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd, Sydney Tamiia Poitier) are out for a drive in Austin, Texas. They all talk with an attitude and gab about their men and sex. Everytime they see a ""Jungle Julia"" billboard they break out in exclamation. It so happens to be publicity for Julia who is a popular radio DJ in town. They are headed to their favorite tavern to meet the ""boys"".There is a mysterious person in a black car that follows Arlene. She later discovers the same car at the tavern.The girls wait in the tavern for their men, meanwhile Stuntmen Mike (Kurt Russell) is being verbally seduced by Pam (Rose McGowan) at the bar.The rain is pouring hard and everyone just yaps while Mike gets to know one of the girls a little better and even gets a dance out of it.Mike has some plans of his own for Pam and takes her for a drive in his ""Death Proof"" car.I will not reveal any more of the plot so you can enjoy the film.Also in the cast: Quentin Tarantino, Michael BaCall, Monica Staggs, Marcy Harriell, Michael Parks, James Parks, Electra Avellan, Elsie Avellan, Zoe Bell, Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elzabeth Winstead, Eli Roth, Jonathan Loughran, Marta Mendoza, Nicky Katt.Disc 2: Would not play in my Apex DVD player.Followed by:Grindhouse Presents, Planet Terror - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)(2007).This film was originally released as Grindhouse (2007) as a double feature, Death Proof/Planet Terror, in 2007, however both films were released separatly on DVD.Michael Parks and James Parks make an appearance as their character from the film,Kill Bill - Volume One(2003).Michael Parks returns as his character, ""Earl McGraw"" and Electra Avellan and Elsie Avellan appear as the ""Babysitter Twins"" and Rose McGowan, Marley Shelton, Nancy Kitt, Zoe Bell, Quentin Tarantino all return in Planet Terror (2007).Extended scenes: Some of the extended and uncut scenes are the dance in the tavern and the black & white sequence beginning the second part of the story.",4,Kurt Russell drives a Death Proof car.,1232668800,"01 23, 2009",2009,2363,"['film', 'old', 'classic', 'Feature', 'Presentation', 'reel', 'saw', '1970', 'fact', 'film', 'made', 'similar', 'low-budget', '1970', 'film', 'including', 'credits', 'chopping', 'editing', 'beginning', 'soundtrack', 'may', 'have', 'come', 'film', 'Village', 'Giants', '1965', '.However', 'Grindhouse', 'story', 'set', '2007', 'girls', 'Arlene', 'Shana', 'Julia', 'Vanessa', 'Ferlito', 'Jordan', 'Ladd', 'Sydney', 'Tamiia', 'Poitier', 'are', 'out', 'drive', 'Austin', 'Texas', 'talk', 'attitude', 'gab', 'men', 'sex', 'Everytime', 'see', 'Jungle', 'Julia', 'billboard', 'break', 'out', 'exclamation', 'so', 'be', 'publicity', 'Julia', 'who', 'popular', 'radio', 'DJ', 'town', 'are', 'headed', 'favorite', 'tavern', 'meet', 'boys', 'mysterious', 'person', 'black', 'car', 'Arlene', 'later', 'same', 'car', 'tavern.The', 'girls', 'wait', 'tavern', 'men', 'meanwhile', 'Stuntmen', 'Mike', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'being', 'verbally', 'seduced', 'Pam', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'bar.The', 'rain', 'pouring', 'hard', 'everyone', 'just', 'yaps', 'Mike', 'know', 'one', 'girls', 'little', 'better', 'even', 'dance', 'it.Mike', 'plans', 'own', 'Pam', 'drive', 'Death', 'Proof', 'car.I', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'more', 'plot', 'can', 'enjoy', 'film.Also', 'cast', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Michael', 'BaCall', 'Monica', 'Staggs', 'Marcy', 'Harriell', 'Michael', 'Parks', 'James', 'Parks', 'Electra', 'Avellan', 'Elsie', 'Avellan', 'Zoe', 'Bell', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Tracie', 'Thoms', 'Mary', 'Elzabeth', 'Winstead', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'Jonathan', 'Loughran', 'Marta', 'Mendoza', 'Nicky', 'Katt.Disc', '2', 'Would', 'not', 'play', 'Apex', 'DVD', 'player.Followed', 'Grindhouse', 'Presents', 'Planet', 'Terror', 'Extended', 'Unrated', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', '2007', '.This', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'Grindhouse', '2007', 'double', 'feature', 'Death', 'Proof/Planet', 'Terror', '2007', 'however', 'films', 'were', 'released', 'separatly', 'DVD.Michael', 'Parks', 'James', 'Parks', 'make', 'appearance', 'character', 'film', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Volume', 'One', '2003', '.Michael', 'Parks', 'returns', 'character', 'Earl', 'McGraw', 'Electra', 'Avellan', 'Elsie', 'Avellan', 'appear', 'Babysitter', 'Twins', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'Marley', 'Shelton', 'Nancy', 'Kitt', 'Zoe', 'Bell', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'return', 'Planet', 'Terror', '2007', '.Extended', 'scenes', 'extended', 'uncut', 'scenes', 'are', 'dance', 'tavern', 'black', 'white', 'sequence', 'beginning', 'second', 'part', 'story']",Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof

1079804,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000R7HY0K,Jason,"[2, 2]","It's true; Death Proof starts out a bit slow.  Don't quit on Tarantino, however, because he eventually delivers.  If you've enjoyed his past works, stick around for the ride and you will be pleasantly entertained.On one hand, this movie is ground-breakingly original.  It's a seamless blend of various genres, with great camera work and character development, and an homage to old fashioned movie-making that is so devoted as to foregoing various modern film-making advances - so much so that the entire film is full of cigarette burns, screen flickers, and color changes that accentuate the action and overall tone being conveyed.  On the other hand, it's an effort in exaggeration, with nearly everything on-screen coming across as a bit forced; it's almost like Tarantino is following his own script at this point, attempting to live up to his own hype.  What has made him famous is the originality and unique style, but it's as if he's trying desperately to repeat everything he's done for his fans previously.  And in the end, it's PERFECT.With that said, it's quintessential Tarantino, from the ingenious dialogue (aside from the overuse of profanity) and random movie inserts (Big Red!) to the quirky, close-up angles and the ubiquitous foot fetish scenes.  Appreciate the yin and yang of the long character buildups because they get totally flipped upside down when least expected.  Relish in the shocks, because they're sudden, and you won't see them coming.  In my favorite part of the movie there's an absolutely epic car crash scene in which four different characters meet their demise, and the scene is replayed four times just to show how each dies tragically - and as a side note, when spinning tire meets face, tire wins.The summary of the movie is essentially Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), finding, stalking, and murdering groups of young, attractive women, by driving directly through them in a moment of carnage from which he narrowly escapes alive because of his death proof stunt-car.  Stuntman Mike is sadistic to the point of psychosis, taunting the women as he toys with their lives; and in each altercation, the end result is meaningless, no matter who dies the audience wins.  Typically, he gets the better of each encounter, but when he runs into a daredevil group of professional stuntwomen his luck changes.Making a great cameo reappearance alongside the cock-eyed, initial victim of Beatrix Kiddo's string of revenge murders in Kill Bill is the father-son cowboy cop combo who investigated the wedding day massacre.  They work their way through the first Stuntman Mike situation in the same clever, humorous manner as they did the chapel.  They provide a wonderful addition that, like the entire movie overall, is like dessert: it's often unnecessary, and you usually have to wait for it, but in the end it's almost always delicious.",4,Don't quit on Tarantino until you get your dessert,1218326400,"08 10, 2008",2008,2863,"['true', 'Death', 'Proof', 'out', 'bit', 'slow', 'Do', ""n't"", 'quit', 'Tarantino', 'however', 'eventually', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'past', 'works', 'stick', 'around', 'ride', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'entertained.On', 'one', 'hand', 'movie', 'ground-breakingly', 'original', 'seamless', 'blend', 'various', 'genres', 'great', 'camera', 'work', 'character', 'development', 'homage', 'old', 'fashioned', 'movie-making', 'so', 'devoted', 'foregoing', 'various', 'modern', 'film-making', 'advances', 'so', 'much', 'entire', 'film', 'full', 'cigarette', 'burns', 'screen', 'flickers', 'color', 'changes', 'accentuate', 'action', 'overall', 'tone', 'being', 'conveyed', 'other', 'hand', 'effort', 'exaggeration', 'nearly', 'everything', 'on-screen', 'coming', 'bit', 'forced', 'almost', 'Tarantino', 'following', 'own', 'script', 'point', 'attempting', 'live', 'up', 'own', 'hype', 'What', 'made', 'famous', 'originality', 'unique', 'style', 'trying', 'desperately', 'repeat', 'everything', 'done', 'fans', 'previously', 'end', 'PERFECT.With', 'said', 'quintessential', 'Tarantino', 'ingenious', 'dialogue', 'aside', 'overuse', 'profanity', 'random', 'movie', 'inserts', 'Big', 'Red', 'quirky', 'close-up', 'angles', 'ubiquitous', 'foot', 'fetish', 'scenes', 'Appreciate', 'yin', 'yang', 'long', 'character', 'buildups', 'get', 'totally', 'flipped', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'least', 'expected', 'Relish', 'shocks', ""'re"", 'sudden', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'favorite', 'part', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'epic', 'car', 'crash', 'scene', 'four', 'different', 'characters', 'meet', 'demise', 'scene', 'replayed', 'four', 'times', 'just', 'show', 'how', 'tragically', 'side', 'note', 'when', 'spinning', 'tire', 'meets', 'face', 'tire', 'wins.The', 'summary', 'movie', 'essentially', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'finding', 'stalking', 'murdering', 'groups', 'young', 'attractive', 'women', 'driving', 'directly', 'moment', 'carnage', 'narrowly', 'alive', 'death', 'proof', 'stunt-car', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'sadistic', 'point', 'psychosis', 'taunting', 'women', 'lives', 'altercation', 'end', 'result', 'meaningless', 'matter', 'who', 'audience', 'wins', 'Typically', 'better', 'encounter', 'when', 'daredevil', 'group', 'professional', 'stuntwomen', 'luck', 'changes.Making', 'great', 'cameo', 'reappearance', 'cock-eyed', 'initial', 'victim', 'Beatrix', 'Kiddo', 'string', 'revenge', 'murders', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'father-son', 'cowboy', 'cop', 'combo', 'who', 'investigated', 'wedding', 'day', 'massacre', 'work', 'way', 'first', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'situation', 'same', 'clever', 'humorous', 'manner', 'did', 'chapel', 'provide', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'entire', 'movie', 'overall', 'dessert', 'often', 'unnecessary', 'usually', 'have', 'wait', 'end', 'almost', 'always', 'delicious']",Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof

I just saw the DVD release of Death Proof, and though Death Proof is a wonderfully imagined and executed film that kicks some serious butt, its content is feeble and inferior in comparison with past Tarantino films. As only part of the release of Grindhouse, the deleted scenese have been added back in. This creates a movie that is too long with a premise that is spread far too thin, and one realises it was a better film when these scenes were left out. It is too much, but at the same time not enough. The original cut of Death Proof was perfect and worked beautifully with Planet Terror and the faux trailers that made up the theater release known as Grindhouse. Grindhouse was a masterpiece, an homage to trash, cult film that worked because its various parts added up to a single, fantastic whole. These films are based upon Grindhouse cinema, they are in and of themselves cheap, exploitation films and the directors know that, they love these kinds of films, and what they created in the theater was not just a movie but a theater experience. They created a context in which movies like these are to be viewed and they reminded us, the audience, what is so delicious and fun about going to see movies like this in the first place. Alone, Death Proof is like watching one half of a movie, what is the point of that? Death Proof and Planet Terror need to be Grindhouse, by themselves, they truly are little more than the low budget horror films that they are homage too (which I don't usually think are worthwhile), they are below the tour de force that Tarantino and Rodriguez usually to a cinematic experience, only when they are together in the Grindhouse package does the genius begin to spark.

1079811,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000R7HY0K,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[5, 6]","This flick was pretty good. Quentin Tarantino could of written this story behind a paper coaster if he wanted to. This story of a stuntman and his fetish for auto-erotica seem just that, split as it is into two separate but corresponding stories. The first half sees four girls getting drunk and dirty at a filthy old bar in town, where they meet the sinister Stuntman Mike (Russell). The latter half sees Mike in pursuit of four new female targets, consisting of Abbie (Dawson), Lee (Mary-Elizabeth Winstead), Kim (Tracey Thoms) and stunt girl Zoe (Bell, playing herself). In both stories, Mike uses his ""death proof"" car to hunt the girls down and get his rocks off.The scratched film certainly looks the part of a B Film, while audio is badly synched, scenes are spliced together in a slapdash fashion and the camera work is shaky. It's a charming and well-meaning idea, but this amateur effect only applies to the first half of the movie. The second half, shot in glorious Technicolor (except for a Kill Bill-esque slip into black and white), is immaculately shot and acted, Tarantino circling the camera around his girls in a seven minute uninterrupted take like a consummate pro. So is this a grind house movie or not? Intentional inconsistency is no excuse.Despite his aping of B-movie directors like Roger Corman, ""Death Proof"" is still very much a Quentin Tarantino film; characters spend what seems like an eternity discussing moot points in that inimitable pop culture patter of his; people and themes pop up from Tarantino adventures been and gone; the requisite lingering foot shot makes an early appearance. Only Russell, in full-on Insano mode, leaves a lasting impression as Stuntman Mike, stealing the entire movie from under the noses of his eight female co-stars, none of whom particularly argue their case well.If you can forgive its flaws (both intentional and unintentional) and just go along for the ride, then ""Death Proof"" is tremendous fun once it kicks into gear. It seems like it takes forever to introduce Stuntman Mike but once Russell moseys into frame, it's game on. The crash in the first half easily ranks as one of Tarantino's most impressive set-pieces (so good you'll be glad it's replayed four times) and the stunt work from Bell in the second half is genuinely gripping: it'll have you digging your thumbs into your armrests. However, if you're looking for something a little meatier than what's essentially a drive-in movie, then this isn't it. As part of something bigger, a more grandiose statement, it absolutely works. Without the context of Grindhouse, however, ""Death Proof"" comes across as little more than an exercise in vanity on behalf of the director, destined to be of interest only to die-hard fans who remember the kind of movies being parodied in the first place.

He sure knows how to ditch it out but when some crazy stunt chicks fight back...can he handle it ?Besides Russel being in great form and the girls being hot, the car chase at the end is great too. But I'm not sure all the talk is needed. The first bunch of girls just talk about guys and sex and then the 2nd batch come along and talk about the same stuff basically. So I don't think it was that needed since all we really needed to know about the 2nd batch is that they don't take crap and that they are pretty wild.While Stunt-Man Mike might or might not really have done stunts in tv shows since no one has even seen his work. He might just be a wannabe who borrowed his stunt-man brother's car, that's my theory anyway lol. With all the talking we do get some new classic Tarantino lines I admit but most of those I think are in the bar scene when we first meet Stunt-man Mike. Although before the action at the end we do get a brutal scene where we see how dangerous Stunt-man Mike and his car really are. Well that is if he is the one ditching it out.

Truly a great homage to the movie theater experience of grindhouse.Unless you have a REALLY big-screen TV or projection screen and thunderous loud audio, this film just won't suffice in bringing the BIG BAD and LOUD experience to you.Also, the ommision of the cheezy, over-the-top fake promos takes cred (and a couple of stars) away from the whole DVD release.

Page ""PageofLegend""","[10, 16]","(warning, this review will contain spoilers, maybe they will save real men the waste of money it would be to buy this hyped of load of feminist propaganda)  Ok, so now to the review.  There I was in the theatre, really enjoying what was so far, an awesome movie.  Yes, the hyped carchase scene was living up to it's hype, then all of a sudden-BAM! It turned from great to sucky in about 10 frames!  You want to know why?  because the evil hags defeat stuntman mike!  Now, when I was watching this the first time, I thought he was going to win, and all of you who were rooting for the evil hags are insane.  You see, they were the evil villains, Stuntman Mike is the hero of the film, so the fact that he died makes it a tragedy.  I was so mad I was literally shaking (like I could barely talk to anyone for about 3 days I was so Irate) when it turned out the evil hags win at the end, I was rooting for Stuntman to make a comeback so bad, and what happened to him was atrocious!  I hated them so bad, at the part where he was on the ground at the end with them in the highway, doing thier retarted cheering, I was literally praying that they would be ran over by a semi or something, it would have at least been a kinda happy ending then. Yes, Stuntman is the hero!  I cheered when he smashed that hippie girl up good, and roared with macho delight when he really gave it to that carfull of idiotic, noisy, and annoying hags.  Serves them right!  Man that wreck smarts! GO STUNTMAN!  Stuntman is so ultimately macho, with his cool hairdo, great taste in food and clothes, and contempt for women!  He rocks!Now you see why he is the ultimate hero, and now onto the women, and why they are the evil villains of the movie.  First of all, the now-sellout QT seems to be on some kind of ""I love it when women triumph over men, I love girlpower!"" trip.  Where did he get this crapshoot, awful ending idea from anyway?  Nice way to metaphorically kick all of us real men in the groin, QT.  Everyone knows that men are smarter, stronger, faster and can do math better than women, that's why, until the phony ending, they are such easy prey for the superior male role model and my personal hero, Stuntman.  Yes, QT truly must have turned into some kind of evil feminist (other wise known as feminazi) sympathiser, and made up this sorry ending to satisfy all of those women out there who, by the looks of this ending, somehow scare and intimidate QT with their girl power.  Newsflash QT, girlpower, meet my mighty male fist, the winner, my fist.  Next, the women in this movie are the villains, because they represent all evil women, who try to get all of a guy's hard earned money with thier decieving good looks, and try to claim it's your baby to get checks out of you, or claim some common law marriage crap.  These techniques also have another name: EXTORTION.  So you see, mighty Stuntman was doing the world a favor, and getting his jollies, two birds in one stone.  By doing the world a favor, I mean getting rid of young hot women before they have a chance to not have a job, spend up a man's hard earned cash, and drive him nuts.  I mean, the first group of girls were lame and boring, I hated them from the start, even Jungle Julia's feet and legs QT, jeez, do you think the camera spent enough time there?  Anyway, the point is, they were all a bunch of lazy pot heads with no jobs anyway, so who cares? (yes Jungle Julia did, but it was a lazy, do nothing job consisting of snappy one liners and playing tapes.  WOW!  STOP THE PRESS!)  They would have continued to be freeloaders, misering men's cash if they had not have been righteously SLAMMED by Stuntman, our savior.  And the second batch of ladies, Zoe looks funny, I liked Rosario, or used to, not after that infuriating ending.  Oh, and the hag with the dreads, who does she think she is anyway, with her inane, trying-to-be-bad-banter  I hate them all!  You see, there Stuntman was just trying to have a little fun!  For god sakes, none of the ladies were even hurt after it!  ""Hey that guy did NOT even injure any of us, lets shoot him, go chase him down, cause a serious wreck, and BEAT HIM TO DEATH!""  Murderers!  Watch out men, they will come for you, you had better start taking martial arts, and working out, and practicing your wheelman skills, I did to get ready for the evil feminazis after I watched this movie!  It was unbearable, it was like watching Snake Plissken get beat down by the spice girls, which brings me to the next topic:Physics flaws.  That's right, I, your oh so grandiose and knowledgeable reviewer, am going to shed light onto some of the physics flaws that will become readily apparent after my cosmic intellect points them out to you.  First, the trunk.  During the second half of the big car chase, the evil hags ram Stuntman's car (which is cooler than theirs!) from behind.  Now, did you notice how they eventually KNOCKED THE TRUNK off of his car, almost tore the whole rear end off, and there was oddly barely a scratch on the front of their car, even more so, as the no-driving dreads girl crashed into everything in sight?  Let's all just ignore the fact that to have done that much damage to an equally big and tough car, they would probably have maimed their radiator, or done some damage to some part of the engine at least, while the damage done to Stuntman's car from that was mostly cosmetic.  Stupid women, in real life, they'd have busted their radiator, and Stuntman would have just drove off as they overheated.Next:  Wasn't his car supposed to be deathproof?  The name maybe should have been changed to Death Resistant there QT, because it looked like during all of that ramming, that Stuntman was getting beat up pretty badly, while the hags weren't so much as phased by all of the rough ramming.  What a crock, think back about that if you've seen it, that final ride was beating him up a lot, and they weren't even flinching with all the ramming?  Yea right.  They'd have been getting bumped up and knocked around too, maybe knocking some of that smarmy attitude out of them.  (note:  never mind the fact that, being a stuntman, Stuntman Mike should have gotten away, in about equal cars, he would clearly be the better driver)Next:  The big wreck at the end, run that load by me again?  Jeez, did anyone actually watch it, anyone with some sense?  There is absolutely no way you come up and tap a car at the rear like that and make it go flipping 20 feet up into the air, all that would have done was maybe have made him fishtail out a bit, but that's about all.Next:  Now, In case all of the girl power lovers, and feminazis and their whipped boyfriends didn't get the message, the beating scene at the end was ludicrous.  Why?  They never would have beat him up like that, he didn't even fight back at all, what a crock.  Don't you think he'd have at least tried to run, or anything?  Never mind the fact that he is so cool and macho, he would have just beat them all down, and took their car, ran them all over for good measure, and gotten away again, which is what would have really happened, but for QT's stupid girl power trip.  A real man like that could have taken any stupid woman, or 3 of them for that matter.  Plus, wussy girl punches and kicks are minor annoyances at most, lacking real power, so please spare me all the fake brutal punch sounds and splattering blood, QT, until he hits back, of course, which would have happened if QT wasn't brainwashed.  Man that would have rocked, to watch those hags get their smarmy faces pummeled to a bloody mess, wouldn't be rudely yelling in his face then, huh?So, in closing, all of the above is why you should avoid this looser:  the ending, the most horrible, shocking, atrocious, crummy, awful piece of junk ever to be released.  But never fear, I have an ultra secret technique to make it rock:  turn it off right after the first wreck.  That's right, by doing that, you make it into a 45 minute movie, with an extremely mesmerizing ending that rocks the eons with its awesomeness!  Oh man, I could watch that wreck all day in slow mo, frame by frame.  That's the only reason to get the DVD, ditch that wuss ending, and enjoy the first half all the way, where all the whining hags get what they deserve, and all real men worship Stuntman as he was, before QT sucked it all up with his girl power garbage, ooh girl power, how about shut up and get me a steak, Zoe!(P.S. One final Idea, Stuntman products!  a whole line up, marketed to real men!  Deodorant, Stuntman Mike hair sprays and other products, official Stuntman watch and shades, driving gloves and more!  And a T-Shirt, with a big as life picture of Stuntman's smiling face, and it says ""Stuntman Mike is my hero!""

1079819,A8F2AZWB20X1H,B000R7HY0K,JLind555,"[5, 9]","... you're in for a humdinger of a ride.  Otherwise, just fast-forward through Texas and pick up the story in Tennessee.Here is Stuntman Mike, walking into a bar, looking for a girl he can entice into his killer car.  Seems Mike is a played-out stuntman with a grudge at the world, especially the distaff half, and he gets his jollies by killing them off in his very own Deathmobile.  Mike has a jacked-up stunt car that he's made practically impregnable on the driver's side but he's turned the passenger side into a death trap.  As at least one unfortunate young lady is going to find out, to her everlasting regret.  He also uses his car as a battering ram to demolish an oncoming car and everyone in it.When Tarantino is good, he is very, very, good, but unfortunately he's less than very good in ""Death Proof"".  The first half of the movie is a crashing bore.  The bar scene drags out interminably to no point.  None of the girls is remotely interesting.  Jungle Julia, played by Sydney Poitier, is a tiresome beeyotch who needs some attitude adjustment (maybe a backhanded slap across the mouth might help); Butterfly, played by Vanessa Ferlito, is just plain embarassing with her pathetic attempt at a lap dance, and the other two girls are just plain forgettable.  I can't even remember their names, that's how little of an impression they make on the viewer.  And Tarantino needs to retire Michael Parks as the small town Texas sheriff and Son Number One.  It was halfway funny in ""Kill Bill"" but it got old fast.Patched up and with the Killmobile lusting for more blood, Stuntman Mike moves to Lebanon, Tennessee, and the second half of the film is as fun as the first half was boring.  Mike runs into four more girls he'd like to feed to the death car, but these girls engage us in a way the four women in Texas never did.  They're fun and refreshingly free of attitude.  Rosario Dawson as Abernathy shows a nice sense of comedy, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fetching as Lee, Zoe Bell (playing herself) shows some acting ability besides being a world-class stuntwoman (she was Uma Thurman's stunt double in ""Kill Bill"") and Tracie Thoms bring just the right amount of street into the role of Kim.  There's a lot of pointless chattering among these four as well, but unlike the first group, these girls are fun to listen to and we laugh along with them.Stuntman Mike wants to turn these ladies into car-fodder as well, but turns out he's messed with the wrong women this time.  These chicks know how to give as good as they get and then some.  The last twenty minutes of the film are a wild ride with a bang-up ending, literally and figuratively.  (I did think Dawson's high-kick coup de grace was just a tad over the top, but that's a minor cavil.)  Ole Mike might want to consider taking up needlepoint as a hobby in his declining years.The second half of the movie almost makes up for the deadly first half, but the first half is bad enough to make me give his film three stars instead of four.  There are plenty of car chases and car crashes, severed limbs and blood and gore throughout the film to satisfy the horror fans, but when all is said and done, it's not enough.  The main problem with ""Death Proof"" is that, in the end, it's only half a movie.Judy Lind",3,If you can stay awake through the first half of the movie...,1216684800,"07 22, 2008",2008,3274,"[""'re"", 'humdinger', 'ride', 'Otherwise', 'just', 'fast-forward', 'Texas', 'pick', 'up', 'story', 'Tennessee.Here', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'walking', 'bar', 'looking', 'girl', 'can', 'entice', 'killer', 'car', 'Seems', 'Mike', 'played-out', 'stuntman', 'grudge', 'world', 'especially', 'distaff', 'half', 'jollies', 'killing', 'off', 'very', 'own', 'Deathmobile', 'Mike', 'jacked-up', 'stunt', 'car', 'made', 'practically', 'impregnable', 'driver', 'side', 'turned', 'passenger', 'side', 'death', 'trap', 'least', 'one', 'unfortunate', 'young', 'lady', 'going', 'find', 'out', 'everlasting', 'regret', 'also', 'car', 'battering', 'ram', 'demolish', 'oncoming', 'car', 'everyone', 'it.When', 'Tarantino', 'good', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'unfortunately', 'less', 'very', 'good', 'Death', 'Proof', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'crashing', 'bore', 'bar', 'scene', 'out', 'interminably', 'point', 'None', 'girls', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'Jungle', 'Julia', 'played', 'Sydney', 'Poitier', 'tiresome', 'beeyotch', 'who', 'attitude', 'adjustment', 'maybe', 'backhanded', 'slap', 'mouth', 'might', 'help', 'Butterfly', 'played', 'Vanessa', 'Ferlito', 'just', 'plain', 'embarassing', 'pathetic', 'attempt', 'lap', 'dance', 'other', 'two', 'girls', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'forgettable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'names', 'how', 'little', 'impression', 'make', 'viewer', 'Tarantino', 'retire', 'Michael', 'Parks', 'small', 'town', 'Texas', 'sheriff', 'Son', 'Number', 'One', 'was', 'halfway', 'funny', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'got', 'old', 'fast.Patched', 'up', 'Killmobile', 'lusting', 'more', 'blood', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'Lebanon', 'Tennessee', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'as', 'fun', 'first', 'half', 'was', 'boring', 'Mike', 'four', 'more', 'girls', ""'d"", 'like', 'feed', 'death', 'car', 'girls', 'engage', 'way', 'four', 'women', 'Texas', 'never', 'did', ""'re"", 'fun', 'refreshingly', 'free', 'attitude', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Abernathy', 'nice', 'sense', 'comedy', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'fetching', 'Lee', 'Zoe', 'Bell', 'playing', 'acting', 'ability', 'being', 'world-class', 'stuntwoman', 'was', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'stunt', 'double', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Tracie', 'Thoms', 'bring', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'street', 'role', 'Kim', 'lot', 'pointless', 'chattering', 'four', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'group', 'girls', 'are', 'fun', 'listen', 'laugh', 'along', 'them.Stuntman', 'Mike', 'turn', 'ladies', 'car-fodder', 'well', 'out', 'messed', 'wrong', 'women', 'time', 'chicks', 'know', 'how', 'give', 'as', 'good', 'get', 'then', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'wild', 'ride', 'bang-up', 'ending', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'did', 'think', 'Dawson', 'high-kick', 'coup', 'de', 'grace', 'was', 'just', 'tad', 'top', 'minor', 'cavil', 'Ole', 'Mike', 'might', 'want', 'consider', 'taking', 'up', 'needlepoint', 'hobby', 'declining', 'years.The', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'almost', 'up', 'deadly', 'first', 'half', 'first', 'half', 'bad', 'enough', 'make', 'give', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'instead', 'four', 'are', 'plenty', 'car', 'chases', 'car', 'crashes', 'severed', 'limbs', 'blood', 'gore', 'film', 'satisfy', 'horror', 'fans', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'not', 'enough', 'main', 'problem', 'Death', 'Proof', 'end', 'only', 'movie.Judy', 'Lind']",Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof

Well boo-freakin'-hoo for all you fanboys out there who probably didn't bother to see ""Grindhouse"" in theaters in the first place. What the hell did you expect? ""Grindhouse"" - as inestimably cool as it was - was a box office disappointment! Contrary to what some reviewers here apparently believe, movie studios do not exist to appease tubby, sweaty-browed 40-year-old film geeks who live in their mothers' basements. Studios exist - from a financial perspective - to do something nobler than that. (Here's a hint: it rhymes with `make money.') Yes, I would like to have seen ""Grindhouse"" released as one set, trailers and all. But don't go blaming ""Death Proof"" for the fact that it wasn't. It's only fair, then, that we look at this movie for what it is rather than what its packaging isn't.And what it is is easily one of the coolest, BEST movies of 2007. Of course it's talky! Have you folks never seen a Quentin Tarantino flick before? Unlike ""Planet Terror,"" which - self-aware as it is - sticks basically to the zombie flick formula, ""Death Proof"" careens between genres to come up with something not so easy to classify. It's a car chase flick/slasher movie/comedy/melodrama/morality play all at once. Sure, there are plenty of nods to the conventions of exploitation cinema past. But this is also an example of one of the rarest breeds of grindhouse films: it's an arthouse flick dressed down for a drive-in audience (think ""Two Lane Blacktop"" or the oft-referenced ""Vanishing Point."") It's not just a movie about a killer, a car and a bunch of hot women. To some extent, it's an exploitation movie about, well, exploitation movies. It's also an awful lot of fun, maybe even better on its own than as the second half of a double bill.Of course, some of the charm of a movie like this may be lost on people who just flat don't know their exploitation films. The choppy edits and sound jumps are easy references to catch. But you know how Stuntman Mike eats his nachos in such disgusting fashion? Or the too-low, seemingly post-sync voice of hillbilly/mechanic Jasper? Or even the long stretches of dialog? These are the kinds of nods to Z-grade cinema that make ""Death Proof"" so much fun for fans of all things lowbrow. And with nods to his own films (a 1/10th second flash of the title strip for ""Miserlou"" on a jukebox, a mention of Big Kahuna Burger), Tarantino constantly reminds us that this ain't real life. It's life the way it tends only to exist in cinema, with thrill-killing villains and vengeful heroines willing to commit all manner of mayhem from behind the wheel of a souped-up muscle car. Or, as the classic tagline for ""Last House on the Left"" once put it, ""It's only a movie...only a movie...only a movie...""THIS JUST IN...Sorry for adding to my initial review, but something occurred to me as I was looking over some other customer comments on this movie. I have to admit, I was a little surprised to see all the negative reviews here. But here's what I'm thinking. The BEST movies, music, books are often met with a mixed reaction from both fans and critics, at least initially. That is, in part I think, because they're different; they don't fit neatly into an expected/comfortable category. Think of a band like the Ramones who were so widely disdained through much of their career. It took a minority of hipsters years to convince the hoi polloi that this was a great, hugely important band. Or think of an album like ""Exile on Main Street"" - poorly reviewed upon its release, but now regarded as one of the Stones' best. Or, for a more recent example, think ""Napoleon Dynamite."" A lot of people absolutely HATED this movie. Very simply, they were wrong. They missed its heart and its sweetness, didn't get the jokes and, probably, wanted something along the lines of ""American Pie.""So, anyone going into ""Death Proof"" expecting a modern action movie is going to be taken aback. This isn't ""The Fast and the Furious,"" thank God. This movie, like ""Reservoir Dogs,"" is about dialog more than demolition. It's about building tension. And, for you folks who seemingly have never seen an action flick from 30 years ago, it's also MUCH more in line with the pacing of 70s exploitation/action/drive-in cinema than you think it is. Take a look back at ""Bullitt"" or ""The French Connection."" Granted, these were top-tier features of their day - they weren't grindhouse flicks. But they're also very talky cop movies which have a grand total of one car chase apiece.

1079830,A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N,B000R7HY0K,"Jonny Rotten ""even handed critic""","[1, 4]","Quentin Tarantino hits another home run classic with ""Death Proof"" by bringing back the cult B classic/exploitaion film genere. Sticking to the roots of where these types of films came from and how they were made,he starts with a simple plot,a ""girls get away"" where four friends leave for a weekend. It starts simply enough,one of the girls (Butterfly) notices the Chevy Nova that seems to be looking and watching her and her friends.Later that night,after lots of drink'in and good times,she notices again the Nova, sort of a forboding presence in the parking lot of the bar.Later they all discover who the car belongs to,none other than ""Stunt man Mike"",a fabulous character portrayal played deliciously by veteran actor Kurt Russle who puts just the right ammount of charisma and creepiness into this character.As the night wears on Stunt Man Mike is introduced to the girls and cashes in on a lap dance by Butterfly(a prank  she was put up to by her friends)done by the very sexy and alluring Vanessa Ferlito.At the end of the night when all say their goodbyes and carry on with their plans,Stunt Man Mike's true colors are shown as he jets out of the parking lot smoking both tires while taking his unwilling hitch hiker (Rose McGowen) for the last and scarriest ride of her life where he then ends the lives of the four girls he was introduced to before abruptly and violently.Months later we find Stunt Man Mike at it again,this time he has his sights set on four new girls and is determined to ""take care"" of his new girl friends.This unfortnately will be his first and last mistake and an incredible car chase ensues when he finds out he has taken a bite of more than he can chew or swallow. This is a great and entertaining film with hommage paid to those classic car films on the past and in true Tarantino style has a fantastic soundtrack to back it up. Phenominal stunts and car chases entwined with blood,sweat,tears,glass and metal with smoking hot women and of course...tires and bad ass muscel cars. This is essentially a ""chick Flick"",but one of a different kind and is as bad to the bone as it could be.Enjoy the fun and the classic,quarky Tarantino diolog ""Death Proof"" delivers all the way.",4,"Grindhouse Presents, Death Proof - Extended and Unrated",1191110400,"09 30, 2007",2007,2212,"['Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'home', 'run', 'classic', 'Death', 'Proof', 'bringing', 'back', 'cult', 'B', 'classic/exploitaion', 'film', 'genere', 'Sticking', 'roots', 'where', 'types', 'films', 'came', 'how', 'were', 'made', 'simple', 'plot', 'girls', 'get', 'away', 'where', 'four', 'friends', 'leave', 'weekend', 'simply', 'enough', 'one', 'girls', 'Butterfly', 'Chevy', 'Nova', 'be', 'looking', 'watching', 'friends.Later', 'night', 'lots', ""drink'in"", 'good', 'times', 'again', 'Nova', 'sort', 'forboding', 'presence', 'parking', 'lot', 'bar.Later', 'discover', 'who', 'car', 'none', 'other', 'Stunt', 'man', 'Mike', 'fabulous', 'character', 'portrayal', 'played', 'deliciously', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Kurt', 'Russle', 'who', 'just', 'right', 'ammount', 'charisma', 'creepiness', 'night', 'wears', 'Stunt', 'Man', 'Mike', 'introduced', 'girls', 'cashes', 'lap', 'dance', 'Butterfly', 'prank', 'was', 'put', 'up', 'friends', 'done', 'very', 'sexy', 'alluring', 'Vanessa', 'Ferlito.At', 'end', 'night', 'when', 'say', 'goodbyes', 'carry', 'plans', 'Stunt', 'Man', 'Mike', 'true', 'colors', 'are', 'shown', 'parking', 'lot', 'smoking', 'tires', 'taking', 'unwilling', 'hitch', 'hiker', 'Rose', 'McGowen', 'last', 'scarriest', 'ride', 'life', 'where', 'then', 'lives', 'four', 'girls', 'was', 'introduced', 'before', 'abruptly', 'violently.Months', 'later', 'find', 'Stunt', 'Man', 'Mike', 'again', 'time', 'sights', 'set', 'four', 'new', 'girls', 'determined', 'take', 'care', 'new', 'girl', 'friends.This', 'unfortnately', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'last', 'mistake', 'incredible', 'car', 'chase', 'when', 'out', 'taken', 'bite', 'more', 'can', 'chew', 'swallow', 'great', 'entertaining', 'film', 'hommage', 'paid', 'classic', 'car', 'films', 'past', 'true', 'Tarantino', 'style', 'fantastic', 'soundtrack', 'back', 'up', 'Phenominal', 'stunts', 'car', 'chases', 'entwined', 'blood', 'sweat', 'tears', 'glass', 'metal', 'smoking', 'hot', 'women', 'course', 'tires', 'bad', 'ass', 'muscel', 'cars', 'essentially', 'chick', 'Flick', 'one', 'different', 'kind', 'as', 'bad', 'bone', 'could', 'be.Enjoy', 'fun', 'classic', 'quarky', 'Tarantino', 'diolog', 'Death', 'Proof', 'way']",Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof
1079831,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B000R7HY0K,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[1, 1]","My four-star rating in the end might be a little generous, but two top-notch elements in ""Death Proof"" prevent me from giving it a lukewarm three stars: Kurt Russell's tour-de-force performance as Stuntman Mike- where he effortlessly moves between cocky/cool, menacing, whiny, and finally, hilariously cowardly- and that uber-cool car battle at the end, as stunt gals take on stunt-psycho for the road-ruling crown.  You have to see this movie for those elements.  Trust me, it's worth sitting through the handful of endless girl-chat scenes to get to them.Ultimately I think I prefer the shorter, tighter cut of ""Death Proof"" that originally appeared in the double-feature theatrical presentation, ""Grindhouse"", though two extra scenes in this longer cut were fun: the notorious lap-dancing scene dangled before us but not delivered in the theaters (instead we got the frustrating practical joke of an apologetic, three-second ""missing reel"" insert card) and a black-and-white interlude at a convenience store that creepily sets the tone for Stuntman Mike's stalking of the second set of girls.  But otherwise I didn't notice anything else of note to justify the added length.Hmmmm, what else to say about this eccentric little DVD? The extra features are entertaining and well done... lots of behind-the-scenes stuff that's fun to see.  And the extras again remind us how enthusiastic Mr. Tarantino is on the set, for a minute making us think that the movie is better than we're giving it credit for.  For a minute.  And, oh yeah... because the movie's closing credits have been redone to excise music and credits for ""Planet Terror"" (the other half of the original ""Grindhouse""), you get some interesting musical additions to replace that stuff, most notably a longer version- featuring a few foreign language verses- of the infectious ""Chick Habit"", performed by April March (the soundtrack album only has the shorter, all-English version of the song).  A small plus but a good one.""Death Proof"" is certainly a lot of fun, and I'm glad I own it on DVD, but for my money, the two ""Kill Bill"" movies are still Mr. Tarantino's best grindhouse-style projects to date.

As the film begins, we're treated to an intentionally scratched and poorly edited print...It all adds to the fun of the experience.Initially, we meet three young women (Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Vanessa Ferlito, and Jordan Ladd) whom we'll follow for about the first 50 minutes of the movie. This serves as the set-up, also introducing Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), the diabolical antagonist.Grindhouse fans may be pleased to know that the ""Missing Reel"" has been restored and we see Arlene (Ferlito, who looks like a low-rent Angelina Jolie) giving Stuntman Mike his lapdance.Death Proof does hit a roadblock relatively early on. Tarantino generally has a deep affection for his characters, as if his characters are his friends. However, this initial group of girls doesn't seem to have that affection. They seem less like friends than annoying acquaintances one only mildly enjoys hanging out with. That's probably why they're gone less than an hour into the movie.14 months after meeting the initial girls, we meet four different girls; it's at this point that the scratches and other grindhouse elements disappear, along with the original tone established for the movie. The four new girls also seem to have Tarantino's affection. The characters are fun to watch and real-life stuntwoman Zoe Bell (playing herself) has a charming screen presence.Beyond all the grindhouse elements, Tarantino also takes some time to reference his own films and Italian giallo films. It would be easy to argue that Death Proof seems more like a loosely strung-together homage than a fully-realized story...But rather than focus on that, it's a lot more fun if you just sit back and enjoy the ride.Furthermore, Stuntman Mike is a memorable antagonist and Kurt Russell is delightfully charming and sinister. It's nice to see him taking a break from his recent family-friendly fare.A lot of people have found Death Proof disappointing and, they're right, this is not a masterpiece. It wasn't meant to be though and this should not be overlooked. Finally, some have seen the ending as an anticlimax...But how else could this film have ended? An epilogue would not have been necessary. What one has to look at here is that Tarantino's loving homage does rise above it's influences. It is pretty good and it made me nostalgic for 1970s grindhouse movies, despite the fact that I wasn't alive in the 1970s. With it's faults, Death Proof is a good, exciting, and entertaining movie, inspired by movies that were never considered particularly good...That's an achievement in itself.GRADE: B",4,Just Enjoy the Ride,1250553600,"08 18, 2009",2009,2884,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'already', 'know', 'Death', 'Proof', 'originally', 'served', 'second', 'half', 'Grindhouse', 'DVD', 'edition', 'extended', 'cut', 'version', 'Written', 'directed', 'photographed', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Death', 'Proof', 'loving', 'homage', '1970s', 'exploitation/grindhouse', 'cinema', 'not', 'just', 'story', 'style', 'as', 'well', 'film', ""'re"", 'treated', 'intentionally', 'scratched', 'poorly', 'edited', 'print', 'fun', 'experience.Initially', 'meet', 'three', 'young', 'women', 'Sydney', 'Tamiia', 'Poitier', 'Vanessa', 'Ferlito', 'Jordan', 'Ladd', 'whom', ""'ll"", 'follow', 'first', '50', 'minutes', 'movie', 'set-up', 'also', 'introducing', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'diabolical', 'antagonist.Grindhouse', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'pleased', 'know', 'Missing', 'Reel', 'been', 'restored', 'see', 'Arlene', 'Ferlito', 'who', 'low-rent', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'giving', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'lapdance.Death', 'Proof', 'hit', 'roadblock', 'relatively', 'early', 'Tarantino', 'generally', 'deep', 'affection', 'characters', 'characters', 'are', 'friends', 'However', 'initial', 'group', 'girls', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'affection', 'seem', 'less', 'friends', 'annoying', 'acquaintances', 'one', 'only', 'mildly', 'hanging', 'out', 'probably', 'why', ""'re"", 'gone', 'less', 'hour', 'movie.14', 'months', 'meeting', 'initial', 'girls', 'meet', 'four', 'different', 'girls', 'point', 'scratches', 'other', 'grindhouse', 'elements', 'disappear', 'original', 'tone', 'established', 'movie', 'four', 'new', 'girls', 'also', 'seem', 'have', 'Tarantino', 'affection', 'characters', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'real-life', 'stuntwoman', 'Zoe', 'Bell', 'playing', 'charming', 'screen', 'presence.Beyond', 'grindhouse', 'elements', 'Tarantino', 'also', 'time', 'reference', 'own', 'films', 'Italian', 'giallo', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'argue', 'Death', 'Proof', 'more', 'loosely', 'strung-together', 'homage', 'fully-realized', 'story', 'rather', 'focus', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'ride.Furthermore', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'memorable', 'antagonist', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'delightfully', 'charming', 'sinister', 'nice', 'see', 'taking', 'break', 'recent', 'family-friendly', 'fare.A', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'found', 'Death', 'Proof', 'disappointing', ""'re"", 'right', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'though', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'overlooked', 'Finally', 'have', 'seen', 'ending', 'anticlimax', 'how', 'else', 'could', 'film', 'have', 'ended', 'epilogue', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'necessary', 'What', 'one', 'look', 'here', 'Tarantino', 'loving', 'homage', 'rise', 'influences', 'pretty', 'good', 'made', 'nostalgic', '1970s', 'grindhouse', 'movies', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'alive', '1970s', 'faults', 'Death', 'Proof', 'good', 'exciting', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'inspired', 'movies', 'were', 'never', 'considered', 'particularly', 'good', 'achievement', 'itself.GRADE', 'B']",Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof

I'm Kind Of A ...","[2, 2]","Tarentino is no doubt in many lists of favorite Writer/Directors but with Grindhouse, he and Rodriguez have bought something old but new to the table. Tarentino's film Death Proof to me was just too good to pass up. I read the synopsis but I still for some reason just couldn't believe it. The film stars Kurt Russell among others but Russell is the most surprising character.Russell plays Stuntman Mike, who is basically a psycho in disguise and it certainly is not a good one.  Stuntman Mike has a black souped-up 1970 Chevy Nova that is what he calls, Death Proof. Stuntman Mike has a bit of a secret, he likes to kill women with his muscle car. He picks who he likes, then takes some pictures of them, and then waits for perfect timing when the women are driving of course, and then have a huge planned car accident.In the first half Mike stalks three friends Arlene(Vanessa Ferlito), Shanna(Jordan Ladd) and a local DJ named Julia Lucai(Sydney Tamiia Poitier). After he heals from the first hit, he moves on to his next victims.  The second victims who are unrelated to the first are Lee Montgomery (Mary Elizabeth Winestead), Abernathy Ross (Rosario Dawson), Kim Mathis (Tracie Thomas), and Zoe Bell. Zoe is visiting from out of town and Tracie and her friends are driving to pick her up from the airport. Tracie and Zoe just happen to be professional stuntwomen.This becomes very evident throughout the remaining scenes of he film. A local resident is selling a white 1970 Dodge Challenger and is advertising it in the paper. This car is the same car that was in the movie Vanishing Point. The car has caught Zoe's eye and she wants to test drive it or so she says. When Zoe, Tracie, and Abernathy decide to partake in a very risky game of ""Ship's Mast"" Mike takes this as an invitation. What Mike didn't know was that he messed with the wrong girls this time.  There was a lot that I loved about Death Proof and there was some stuff that I didn't like.I loved the characters; they were all unique and well written. They seemed like real people that reacted to the situations perfectly. The girls from the second half of the film were sick and amazing to complete the film nicely. The car chases were very intense and very fast. Not only will the crashes take your breath away but also what the second half of girls does to Stuntman Mike is jaw dropping, no lie.  What I didn't like about Death proof was the prolonged talking that felt like it would never end. This even made me want to give this movie 3.5 stars. Tarantino admits that he is not the greatest writer when it comes to dialogue and it shows in this film. The dialogue is a little dry in some spots and long-winded but despite this, the movie was still worthy of 4 stars. Other than that Death Proof was a great movie, I would say that the pacing was almost off but evened itself out in a good way. The action scenes were extremely exciting and I would recommend this to all Tarantino lovers for sure.",4,"A Little Too Much, A Little Too Little, But The End Is Just Right",1214956800,"07 2, 2008",2008,2972,"['Tarentino', 'doubt', 'many', 'lists', 'favorite', 'Writer/Directors', 'Grindhouse', 'Rodriguez', 'have', 'bought', 'something', 'old', 'new', 'table', 'Tarentino', 'film', 'Death', 'Proof', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'pass', 'up', 'read', 'synopsis', 'still', 'reason', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'film', 'stars', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'others', 'Russell', 'most', 'surprising', 'character.Russell', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'who', 'basically', 'psycho', 'disguise', 'certainly', 'not', 'good', 'one', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'black', 'souped-up', '1970', 'Chevy', 'Nova', 'what', 'Death', 'Proof', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'bit', 'secret', 'kill', 'women', 'muscle', 'car', 'who', 'then', 'pictures', 'then', 'waits', 'perfect', 'timing', 'when', 'women', 'are', 'driving', 'course', 'then', 'have', 'huge', 'planned', 'car', 'accident.In', 'first', 'half', 'Mike', 'stalks', 'three', 'friends', 'Arlene', 'Vanessa', 'Ferlito', 'Shanna', 'Jordan', 'Ladd', 'local', 'DJ', 'named', 'Julia', 'Lucai', 'Sydney', 'Tamiia', 'Poitier', 'first', 'hit', 'next', 'victims', 'second', 'victims', 'who', 'are', 'unrelated', 'first', 'are', 'Lee', 'Montgomery', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winestead', 'Abernathy', 'Ross', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Kim', 'Mathis', 'Tracie', 'Thomas', 'Zoe', 'Bell', 'Zoe', 'visiting', 'town', 'Tracie', 'friends', 'are', 'driving', 'pick', 'up', 'airport', 'Tracie', 'Zoe', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'professional', 'stuntwomen.This', 'very', 'evident', 'remaining', 'scenes', 'film', 'local', 'resident', 'selling', 'white', '1970', 'Dodge', 'Challenger', 'advertising', 'paper', 'car', 'same', 'car', 'was', 'movie', 'Vanishing', 'Point', 'car', 'caught', 'Zoe', 'eye', 'test', 'drive', 'so', 'When', 'Zoe', 'Tracie', 'Abernathy', 'decide', 'partake', 'very', 'risky', 'game', 'Ship', 'Mast', 'Mike', 'invitation', 'What', 'Mike', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'messed', 'wrong', 'girls', 'time', 'was', 'lot', 'loved', 'Death', 'Proof', 'was', 'stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'like.I', 'loved', 'characters', 'were', 'unique', 'well', 'written', 'seemed', 'like', 'real', 'people', 'reacted', 'situations', 'perfectly', 'girls', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'were', 'sick', 'amazing', 'complete', 'film', 'nicely', 'car', 'chases', 'were', 'very', 'intense', 'very', 'fast', 'Not', 'only', 'will', 'crashes', 'take', 'breath', 'away', 'also', 'what', 'second', 'half', 'girls', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'lie', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Death', 'proof', 'was', 'prolonged', 'talking', 'felt', 'would', 'never', 'end', 'even', 'made', 'want', 'give', 'movie', '3.5', 'stars', 'Tarantino', 'not', 'greatest', 'writer', 'when', 'dialogue', 'film', 'dialogue', 'little', 'dry', 'spots', 'long-winded', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'worthy', '4', 'stars', 'Other', 'Death', 'Proof', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'pacing', 'was', 'almost', 'evened', 'out', 'good', 'way', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'extremely', 'exciting', 'would', 'recommend', 'Tarantino', 'lovers', 'sure']",Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof

Kurt Russell plays the deranged Stuntman Mike, who likes to take his specially-adapted car (deathproofed with a harness and roll cage for the driver, and a huge death's-head painted on the hood) and smash it at full speed into cars carrying pretty young girls. The violence and gore is pure classic Tarantino: Burlesqued grotesque.Stuntman Mike always walks away. They don't.They don't that is, until the scarred Stuntman Mike runs afoul of a car driven by a pair of female stunt drivers (Stuntwoman Zoe Bell stars as herself). At first he gets the drop on them, but when they realize he means to kill them they engage him in an amazing eighteen minute high speed chase scene reminiscent of BULLITT, THE FRENCH CONNECTION, THE SEVEN UPS, and others too numerous to mention, after which the girls take their revenge. It's a case history of Female Empowerment as seen through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino.Just like the films it pays homage to, DEATH PROOF starts out with it storyline meandering along at a clip somewhat slower than refrigerated ketchup, but we get to meet and like the girls, even while Tarantino teases us with hints of T & A. Thus, when Stuntman Mike breaks out of his rather bland persona into a leering maniac, we shudder. The last half hour---particularly the chase scene---will keep you hopping.Although its only half of the GRINDHOUSE experience, DEATH PROOF stands on its own merits, particularly if you're a fan of the low-budget films it honors.",5,"""I've got a bruise on me bum.""",1190073600,"09 18, 2007",2007,2043,"['one', 'half', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'stylized', 'homage', 'dollar', 'theater', 'GRINDHOUSE', 'expanded', 'faux', 'movie', 'trailers.DEATH', 'PROOF', 'blobs', 'crackles', 'changes', 'hue', 'missing', 'reels', 'would', 'expect', 'low-budget', 'schlock', 'film', 'had', 'made', 'rounds', 'so-called', 'grindhouses', 'sticky-seated', 'torn-screen', 'movie', 'palaces', 'popcorn', 'mutating', 'seats', 'places', 'showed', 'forgotten', 'classics', 'PELVIS', 'THE', 'CARS', 'THAT', 'EAT', 'PEOPLE.DEATH', 'PROOF', 'not', 'car', 'people', 'car', 'people', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'deranged', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'who', 'take', 'specially-adapted', 'car', 'deathproofed', 'harness', 'roll', 'cage', 'driver', 'huge', ""death's-head"", 'painted', 'hood', 'smash', 'full', 'speed', 'cars', 'carrying', 'pretty', 'young', 'girls', 'violence', 'gore', 'pure', 'classic', 'Tarantino', 'Burlesqued', 'grotesque.Stuntman', 'Mike', 'always', 'away', ""don't.They"", 'do', ""n't"", 'scarred', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'afoul', 'car', 'driven', 'pair', 'female', 'stunt', 'drivers', 'Stuntwoman', 'Zoe', 'Bell', 'herself', 'first', 'drop', 'when', 'realize', 'kill', 'engage', 'amazing', 'eighteen', 'minute', 'high', 'speed', 'chase', 'scene', 'reminiscent', 'BULLITT', 'THE', 'FRENCH', 'CONNECTION', 'THE', 'SEVEN', 'UPS', 'others', 'too', 'numerous', 'mention', 'girls', 'take', 'revenge', 'case', 'history', 'Female', 'Empowerment', 'seen', 'eyes', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino.Just', 'films', 'homage', 'DEATH', 'PROOF', 'out', 'meandering', 'along', 'clip', 'somewhat', 'slower', 'refrigerated', 'ketchup', 'get', 'meet', 'girls', 'even', 'Tarantino', 'hints', 'T', 'A', 'Thus', 'when', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'rather', 'bland', 'persona', 'leering', 'maniac', 'shudder', 'last', 'half', 'hour', '-particularly', 'chase', 'scene', '-will', 'keep', 'hopping.Although', 'only', 'half', 'GRINDHOUSE', 'experience', 'DEATH', 'PROOF', 'own', 'merits', 'particularly', ""'re"", 'fan', 'low-budget', 'films', 'honors']",Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof

Shocking it was, then, when I encountered ""Death Proof"", an adrenaline shot of a movie that hurtles at the speed of light to nowhere, all in a rapid pace, but alternating with many elaborate scenes of talk and chatter which I (contrary to others) find to be enjoyable as opposed to being ""slow."" However, ""Death Proof"" is, in my opinion, the most violent Tarantino film, and this is not a compliment. Its foul language, its punk filming style (I kind of like the grainy, pops-and-cracks homage to 70's drive-in theater exploitation film reels, but it's a gimmick and not a necessity here), and its distasteful sense of sexuality (one scene includes a smoking hot lap-dance that seems out of place) all contribute to the film's make it or break it leanings, and, for me personally, it doesn't quite work. If it weren't so persistent in trying to be offensive, I might have enjoyed it more, but the violent sequences (while not always frequent) are pretty hard to take. I did, however, enjoy seeing Kurt Russell in this movie, it felt like a comeback of sorts (although my favorite film of his is still 1998's ""Breakdown""). It seems as if Tarantino wanted to make a girls vs. boys movie, and as such, I think it's too much of a joke that is not funny, hence my interest in the film is lessened due to this. I thought I might have enjoyed it more since other critics seem to think is Tarantino's poorest effort but, oddly enough, I think I agree in this instance. It's just too much of everything that adds up to so little in the end--which is a shame, because Tarantino is quite an interesting (if not inventive) writer and his love of cinema is genuine. Unfortunately, ""Death Proof"" is not my idea of a fun slasher/thriller flick, so I felt it did not work as well as it could have. Maybe in time I will like it more, but as of now I don't think of it as being worthwhile.The 2-disc DVD is fine, with several fun extras, but since this is a ""throw away"" project, there's nothing terribly important to be discussed in terms of the film's story or its characters.

They often have a point as you don't want a director to get too big an ego and Tarantino does have his failings (e.g. the climactic scene inKill Bill 2).However, what once a director has been knocked off his pedestal, critics then see everything else he does through a lens of failure.This film, although not as vivid and brilliant as Pulp Fiction or Jackie Brown is still a good film with enough decent dialogue and plot to make for very entertaining viewing. And as a homage to road movies such asVanishing PointandBullittit succeeds in having both good car chase sequences AND a good plot to go with it.So, if you're dreading that this film is going to a lemon and think that it should be overlooked, then do remember that Tarantino is still a first class director and is much more worthy of your time than the works of 90% of the other movies out there.Maybe directors do lose their edge with time, but a bad album from Abba is still better than a good album from Bucks Fizz...",5,Tarantino's low point?

The only problem is that vibe was missing from ""Death Proof"" (along with some DVD extras).Now I have no problem with talky pictures. David Mamet and Kevin smith can pull that off in spades. And as much as a gifted writer QT may be this movie comes across as very talky before any of the real action occurs (a head-on collision, shown from different perspectives as each victim in the car gets mutilated accordingly to the climactic chase near the end of the movie...and I might as well include the action of watching Kurt Russell eat nachos). Here the dialogue just goes on and on and on and just becomes boring.I've mentioned the action. All of that stuff could easily be extracted and recut into a film about half the current length. Or even less than that. But then, wasn't that the point? That it's a parody of sorts? Only that it isn't so much the parody of the ""grindhouse"" genre but more along the lines of a parody of QT. Only here it just ain't funny. Or isn't that the point of making a deliberately bad movie? As far as QT's movies in my DVD library are concerned I haven't watched this one in a while and I'm not inclined to do so in the near future. I think two viewings was it. My other DVDs, including his other films, got more replays.Trey Parker did that with Orgazmo, by pulling out as many bad and cheesy movie effects plus just as low-par dialogue, and that movie was very entertaining in and of itself. It was deliberately bad yet all the more entertaining than this. It's as though anything resembling any satirical standard was forgotten or deliberately siphoned off.Now, the stunt work by Zoe Bell was good. It's not often that female stuntpeople get their due. But then when she's doing her stunts it's just so little and very late in the picture. Again, all of that buildup and you'd think there would be more in regards to the payoff.So this movie is pretty bad. And, as far as DVD extras go, the ""Death Proof"" 2-disc edition certainly doesn't measure up. No commentary, no fake trailers. In fact both discs seem a bit light on content. Compared to Robert Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" 2-disc edition this is just a waste of some decent polycarbonate and aluminum alloy substrate (give or take a little silk-screened paint).This was a very disappointing release. I'd say that of the hundreds of DVDs I have this one is the worst of all. It doesn't even have that ""it's so bad it's pretty damn funny"" vibe that makes ""Planet Terror"" a superior film.

1079854,AIFNOZKR9WTYI,B000R7HY0K,"mark twain ""25354""","[0, 1]","[sound of blowing] ""uhh... hello?  this thing on?  Alright I want everybody in the entire world to stop what they're doing and pay close attention.  Cause I just got something to say to you.  And it goes a little something like this:  Deathproof is not a perfect movie.  It is a blend of a genius premise and a flawed execution.  The women in the movie are all extremely vulgar and grating, unintentionally I believe.  And this is the poor execution that mars the fantastic premise of a guy that mows down a bunch of women with his car -- himself being hospitalized thereafter -- then, as a sort of cosmic irony, is himself busted up real bad by ANOTHER bunch of chicks who kill him with karate moves, right out there on the two-lane blacktop.  This premise is so absurd, so completely, laughably preposterous, so INCONSEQUENTIAL that it is true art.  Deathproof is full of inconsequentiality just as TOP HAT is.  And it, in it's own way, approaches the same ether-sphere of artistic heaven.  Tarantino, through vulgar execution, falls just short of true art in the finished product... but he's definitely a hip, not a square.  And nowadays, the squares they are so many.  And the hips they are so few.  What is it to be a hip?  Is it to wear your pants falling down and your hat on backward and some sunglasses MTV told you to wear?  Hardly.  To be a hip is to see things from a special angle.  The sixties were a failed hip revolution because of the basic flawed implicit idea that the hip perspective and economy can be mass-produced with the aid of psychedelic drugs.  There's nothing wrong with psychedelic drugs, but they don't turn a square into a hip.  Nothing can.  What's that?  What is a square?  Very simple:  A square is a person who, deep down, has no sense of humor.  No, not the kind of humor where you watch Jackass and laugh when the guy does something stupid.  I'm talking about a cosmic sense of humor.  It is this cosmic sense of humor that lets the hip see that at some basic level life is just a riff and a routine, full of buzz and kick and verve.  But the square, he can't see that.  He can't see it even if he's decked out in all the hipster trimmings, over-urbanized, over-socialized, over-surface-ized.  True hips are very rare.  Back in the old days, even the hips were still basically squares.  And real hips, you may not agree with all they come out with.  But you've got to admire it.  Mozart was a hip, though I don't really dig his music all that special.  Stendahl was a hip, Burroughs was a hip, Hunter S. Thompson was a hip.  They all had that basic, cosmic unseriousness that is what transcends this life and reaches into the world beyond.  See, you can't get out of this world with seriousness alone.  And that's where so many religious seekers go wrong.  They think enlightenment can exist without humor.  But it can't.  And you know the old saying, ""the Lord moves in mysterious ways""?  Well, that's just another way of saying that God is a hip.

They should at least give us the option of buying them together or separately. Secondly, this is the ""Extended and unrated, 2 disc, special edition"" yet the fake movie previews (that I felt were an important part of the movie)are nowhere to be found on either disc! That's why I'm giving this 2 stars.As for the movie itself, I liked ""Planet Terror"" better than ""Death Proof"". Death Proof, is a good movie but A LOT  of the dialogue between the girls is EXHAUSTING. Kurt Russell is fantastic as Stuntman Mike! I'd like to see him take on more villainous roles. The stunts are spectacular! They don't make movies like these anymore and I praise QT for bringing this style of movie making back into the light. I noticed 2 main differences between this extended version and the theatrical version. One is that we now get to see the missing lap dance footage in the bar. It's a good scene but i think it added to the charm of the movie when it was missing. Also we get to see when Stuntman Mike finds the second group of girls. This scene should not have been left out of the theater. For one it's a really good scene shot in Black and white, and secondly it provides knowledge to the viewer that is helpful in putting the whole film together.I give the movie itself 3 1/2 stars.

Here's my thing with Death Proof, it is a nice seventies homage, but its mostly just all talk, Tarantino style. and while this is entertaining after awhile, it gets pretty boring after the initial pass. however, i must say then when the action does happen, it is well worth it, the last thirty minutes or so being not only thrilling but hilarious at the same time.Death Proof has a relativly simple plot. a deranged stunt man who stalks his victoms and then kills them with his car. Russell obviously has fun with the role and all the 'girls' have there own fun with the roles their given, especially Zoe Bell and Tracie Thoms.My other complaint is that, i don't know what exactly happened, but somewhere along the line, the whole grittiness and beat up method used in the movie sort of got lost in the second half. Why this happened, i'm not sure, but its just something that sort of disconnects me from the movie.And finally, about the whole splitting up the film thing, i'm not bothered about it much. But i am bothered that they've cut out the trailers, now see i loved those, i thought they were inventive, funny, and just a blast to watch, escpecially Thanksgiving, so hilarious!I do hope they re-release Grindhouse in its original theater content, trailers and all.

His character and motivation are not explained as to why the hell he does what he does, but I guess thats probably what they where going for in this.It's quality is bad, but done on purpose, it's supposed to give the feel of how drive in movies where in the 70's, tho it kinda gets a bit annoying after a while, but more with Planet Terror.The opening scene is a bit too long, i found myself almost nodding off while 3 chicks go on and on about useless things in there lives that have no tie in to the plot whatsoever. However, by the time there death scene comes, you are happy to see the annoying ego driven chick, the younger looking Angelina Joeline wanna-be and there quieter spethshall friends taken out.Stunt Man Mikes kind of stalks them, then makes friends with them in a bar, offers someone a lift home, and the 5 hideous girls lives are in the hands of Mike's ""death proof"" car. Death Proof meaning the car is a stunt car, rigged for movies, so if it crashes, the driver will be safe. Which Kurt Russel's character utilizes on.It almost feels like it could have been a half hour TV show, as now two useless cops into play just to waste up some screen time, then Mike heals up, and he's at it again, only this time what goes around, comes around.Overall, the whole thing is watchable, it's ok, but it's not fantastic. The first half of the movie is shot for the 70's drive in look, then stalk #2 is clear.The thing that made it odd to me was it looked and sounded like it was supposed to be in the 70's, but it was present day due to unneeded and useless scenes involving text messaging by cell phones.IMO none of those things where needed and should have been cut out, and kept it like it was supposed to be set in the 70's.The second act, left me thinking three words... WTF?Was the cheerleader and behind the counter sales of a fashion magazine needed, or supposed to be funny, I dunno... I think they just had a 30 minute movie and stretched it out as much as they could with useless scenes of dialog that go for too long and have absolutely nothing to do with the movie. However the end chase scene is pretty entertaining, it's good to see a non CGI car chase on film again that gets the excitement pumping as you watch.It's watchable, but not something i would buy or copy, so I'd recommend renting it overall if you are curious.",3,The Dark General Lee VS a White Starsky & Hutch Broom Broom,1206489600,"03 26, 2008",2008,2684,"[""'d"", 'been', 'wanting', 'see', 'long', 'time', 'never', 'got', 'released', 'cinemas', 'here', 'due', 'being', 'cut', 'half', 'instead', 'being', 'screened', 'Planet', 'Terror', 'Australia', 'was', 'supposed', 'finally', 'arrived', 'DVD', 'here', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'was', 'going', 'be.Kurt', 'Russel', 'Stunt', 'Man', 'Mike', 'guy', 'who', 'issues', 'character', 'motivation', 'are', 'not', 'explained', 'why', 'hell', 'what', 'guess', 'thats', 'probably', 'what', 'where', 'going', 'this.It', 'quality', 'bad', 'done', 'purpose', 'supposed', 'give', 'feel', 'how', 'drive', 'movies', 'where', '70', 'bit', 'annoying', 'while', 'more', 'Planet', 'Terror.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'i', 'found', 'almost', 'nodding', 'off', '3', 'chicks', 'go', 'useless', 'things', 'lives', 'have', 'tie', 'plot', 'whatsoever', 'However', 'time', 'death', 'scene', 'are', 'happy', 'see', 'annoying', 'ego', 'driven', 'chick', 'younger', 'looking', 'Angelina', 'Joeline', 'wanna-be', 'quieter', 'spethshall', 'friends', 'taken', 'out.Stunt', 'Man', 'Mikes', 'kind', 'stalks', 'then', 'friends', 'bar', 'someone', 'lift', 'home', '5', 'hideous', 'girls', 'lives', 'are', 'hands', 'Mike', 'death', 'proof', 'car', 'Death', 'Proof', 'meaning', 'car', 'stunt', 'car', 'rigged', 'movies', 'so', 'driver', 'will', 'be', 'safe', 'Which', 'Kurt', 'Russel', 'character', 'on.It', 'almost', 'feels', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'half', 'hour', 'TV', 'show', 'now', 'two', 'useless', 'cops', 'play', 'just', 'waste', 'up', 'screen', 'time', 'then', 'Mike', 'heals', 'up', 'again', 'only', 'time', 'what', 'around', 'around.Overall', 'whole', 'thing', 'watchable', 'ok', 'not', 'fantastic', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'shot', '70', 'drive', 'look', 'then', 'stalk', '2', 'clear.The', 'thing', 'made', 'was', 'looked', 'sounded', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', '70', 'was', 'present', 'day', 'due', 'unneeded', 'useless', 'scenes', 'involving', 'text', 'messaging', 'cell', 'none', 'things', 'where', 'needed', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'kept', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'set', ""70's.The"", 'second', 'act', 'left', 'thinking', 'three', 'words', 'WTF', 'Was', 'cheerleader', 'counter', 'sales', 'fashion', 'magazine', 'needed', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'dunno', 'think', 'just', 'had', '30', 'minute', 'movie', 'stretched', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'useless', 'scenes', 'dialog', 'go', 'too', 'long', 'have', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'However', 'end', 'chase', 'scene', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'good', 'see', 'non', 'CGI', 'car', 'chase', 'film', 'again', 'excitement', 'pumping', 'watch.It', 'watchable', 'not', 'something', 'i', 'would', 'buy', 'copy', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'renting', 'overall', 'are', 'curious']",Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof

""Death Proof"" offers gruesome murders, bang-up car chases, and sexy women for the moviegoer who doesn't like a lot of context with his entertainment. Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) is a teetotalling, scar-faced killer who stalks and slays his pretty young victims with his souped-up death-proof stunt car.Shot in natural tones and altered to look like a scratched, crackly print that has run through the projector too many times, cast with characters who smoke and drink carelessly and constantly, ""Grindhouse"" intermittently feels like nostalgia. But this is more than a homage to cruder days gone by. It sends up its own inspirations and shows us just why we like the unapologetic sex-violence dichotomy of B-movies. Cell phones and ATMs remind us that this is not a period film. The period is now; the style was then. The culture encompasses both, and indeed the entire modern era, which is why this is so fun to watch.The Weinstein Company 2007 2-disc DVD set does not include any of the fake trailers that were part of ""Grindhouse""'s theatrical release. This version of ""Death Proof"" is 2 hours long, while the American theatrical double-bill version was only 90 minutes. The ""missing reel"" has been recovered, but 2 hours felt too long to me. 90 minutes cut short Tarantino's signature languishing on tawdry social scenes and catchy inane conversation.

What a great over the-top-action flick with tons of tongue in cheek laughs.  After it ends, you're treated to the real star of Grindhouse; the 3 fake trailers in the middle of the double feature.  We laughed so hard.  they were fantastic....and then comes DEATHPROOF.  I like Tarantino's stuff and think Pulp Fiction is one of the top 20 movies ever.  Deathproof halts the whole experience to a ""grinding"" pace.  Horribly boring, the theatrical version sets up the killings of chicks with unending talk about nothing.  Tarantino scripts that even took his own writing too serious as we have to sit through chicks talking about NOTHING for prolonged periods of time. All just to get to the cool chase at the end.  I told my brother to see Grindhouse and stay for the trailers after Planet Terror and then just get up and leave before Deathproof starts.  It was terrible.This dvd is going to give you almost 30 minutes more of more talking about nothing.  They have hacked out the fake trailers, which were the best parts of Grindhouse to begin with and you know they're just going to milk you for the ""total Grindhouse experience"" dvd later next year.

1079875,A2XVA2OGDYKKD,B000R7HY0K,Monsieur Valentine,"[3, 4]","Both 'Resevoir Dogs', and 'Pulp fiction' are phenomenal films by Quentin Tarantino. I wont deny him that. And whilst the Kill Bills played a very large homage to films of the past (including a scene that came straight out of Good Bad and the Ugly) I was willing to accept his ambitions as a movie buff.But the Grindhouse films are simply a blatant attempt to cash in on the history of cinema. Its a movie buff trying to see the job through (starting with Kill Bill). Its more blatant and to be quite honest I find it insulting. Wouldnt we all love to make a movie that ripped off some of our favourite films from back in the day. HE Throws in a few Quentin trademarks, blood splatters, drawn out coffee conversations, and overly cool lines... and you have yourself the Grindhouse.Deathproof is Quentin's overly stylized film with very little substance. I am a fan of the very films he tries to emulate and even though he tries ever so hard to make these feel and sound like the 70's cult classics... it lacks any flair. He tries too hard.. the grazing of the film quality and the intermittent reel skips are just too forced. Its like going to Disney Land... nothing is real... and everything is... ""how can we make this cool""Tarantino is all about how can we make this cool... oh I know... let the girls kick some a$$... oh I know ... I'll make her walk around with one leg... oh I know... Ill make myself a bad a$$.The endings to both Grindhouse movies are terribly over the top and I know we can sit here and argue that it was intentional in the tradition of 70's cult classics... but it doesnt work... and thats the bottom line.So is this Tarantino's future, to indulge as a movie buff.. to borrow, steal and pluck from the tree... is this ok?.. as long as he admits to it?Does he think he is doing us a favour. As if to say that we had not seen such classics or that we needed the cult explained to us once more?Of course he has a fan base now that will call whatever he does ""genius"".This is not Genius... the originals are... this is a movie that copies from other movies. Plain and simple folks.(Yeh Im annoyed... dont ever steal from 'the Good bad and the ugly' ever again Quentin - these are our classic cult films too).",2,"When I get paid, I always see the job through",1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,2229,"[""'Resevoir"", 'Dogs', 'fiction', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'films', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'wont', 'deny', 'whilst', 'Kill', 'Bills', 'played', 'very', 'large', 'homage', 'films', 'past', 'including', 'scene', 'came', 'straight', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', 'was', 'willing', 'accept', 'ambitions', 'movie', 'Grindhouse', 'films', 'are', 'simply', 'blatant', 'attempt', 'cash', 'history', 'cinema', 'movie', 'buff', 'trying', 'see', 'job', 'starting', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'more', 'blatant', 'be', 'quite', 'honest', 'find', 'insulting', 'love', 'make', 'movie', 'ripped', 'off', 'favourite', 'films', 'back', 'day', 'HE', 'few', 'Quentin', 'trademarks', 'blood', 'splatters', 'drawn', 'out', 'coffee', 'conversations', 'overly', 'cool', 'lines', 'have', 'Grindhouse.Deathproof', 'Quentin', 'overly', 'stylized', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'substance', 'am', 'fan', 'very', 'emulate', 'even', 'ever', 'so', 'hard', 'make', 'feel', 'sound', '70', 'cult', 'classics', 'flair', 'too', 'hard..', 'grazing', 'film', 'quality', 'intermittent', 'reel', 'skips', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'forced', 'going', 'Disney', 'Land', 'nothing', 'real', 'everything', 'how', 'can', 'make', 'cool', 'Tarantino', 'how', 'can', 'make', 'cool', 'oh', 'know', 'let', 'girls', 'kick', 'oh', 'know', ""'ll"", 'make', 'walk', 'one', 'leg', 'oh', 'know', 'Ill', 'make', 'bad', '.The', 'endings', 'Grindhouse', 'movies', 'are', 'terribly', 'top', 'know', 'can', 'sit', 'here', 'argue', 'was', 'intentional', 'tradition', '70', 'cult', 'classics', 'work', 'thats', 'bottom', 'line.So', 'Tarantino', 'future', 'indulge', 'movie', 'buff..', 'borrow', 'steal', 'pluck', 'tree', 'ok', 'as', 'long', 'think', 'doing', 'favour', 'say', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'such', 'classics', 'needed', 'cult', 'explained', 'once', 'more', 'course', 'fan', 'base', 'now', 'will', 'call', 'genius', '.This', 'not', 'Genius', 'originals', 'are', 'movie', 'copies', 'other', 'movies', 'Plain', 'simple', 'folks', 'Yeh', 'Im', 'annoyed', 'dont', 'ever', 'steal', ""'the"", 'Good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'ever', 'again', 'Quentin', 'are', 'classic', 'cult', 'films', 'too']",Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof
1079876,A12N6XUM5ZYLXG,B000R7HY0K,"Mons ""Mons""","[1, 4]","The eagerly anticipated grindhouse double-feature of Death Proof/Planet Terror promised to be a double-barrel shotgun blast of 70s-inspired action, courtesy of the two hottest names in cinema, the dynamic duo of Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill) and Robert Rodriguez (Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Dawn to Dusk). Given Tarantino's track record in the action genre, this offering promised to be a rollicking roller-coaster ride. But it isn't.Opinions seem to differ about the relative merits of these two films, but in my opinion Tarantino's movie, Death Proof, is by far the weaker of the two.For a start, Death Proof doesn't do what it says on the tin. In addition to being too 'talky' for the kind of movie it professes to be, there is no excitement, no drama, no conflict. Remember the 'foot massage' or 'le big mac' dialogue in Pulp Fiction? Imagine that covering a whole movie. This is what Death Proof feels like after you've been watching it for 60 minutes. The first 45 minutes is taken up by cod-philosophising and inane chit-chat. Tarantino points the camera at four good-looking babes as they drive to a bar and party. There are stylish shots of booze being poured and an interminable number of close-ups of the jukebox. Kurt Russell is wheeled out to do his windswept hero schtick. A sexy femme fatale blonde is thrown into the mix. Much flirtation and 'snappy' dialogue ensues and finally, after what seems like an eternity, the film bursts into action with a car chase and a crash. Five minutes later, after a brief interlude with the Coen-esque sherrif and his gormless sidekick, Tarantino is back to pointing the camera at babes in cars(different ones this time). Cue more small talk, gossip and cultural namedropping to add a veneer of sophistication and cool. More Kurt Russell. The film changes from black and white to colour and back. Where's the dramatic tension?Having always been a Tarantino fan and I really wanted to like Death Proof but compared with Planet Terror this is really weak. Death Proof is the work of a successful moviemaker riding high on the success of former glories. The man obviously has talent.

The whole idea of a grindhouse film is that it is supposed not to make a lot of sense as a story, except that the story serves as a justification for the guilty pleasure in the form of titillation, both violent and sexy. It is supposed to be a kind of throwaway effort, something that is thrown together as cheaply as possible as long as there are beautiful people and violent gimmicks you've never seen before as a draw.The best grindhouse films have something extra, a bit of social commentary, or an existential theme (facing death suddenly and unexpectedly never fails to elicit, at least obliquely, some questions about authenticity and the meaning of life), or some kind of payback to the audience that turns their own pleasures against them (e.g. if the film begins by titillating a male audience by exploiting women and ends by turning the tables having a woman turn tough on her assailant). In that respect, Tarantino has done exactly what he aimed for -- the film is fun and funny, it adds to the grindhouse theme his trademark witty dialogue, and turns the hunter into the hunted. Tarantino knows his stuff, he obviously loves this kind of thing, and you feel his excitement. His own cameo and the cameo of Eli Roth didn't really work for me, but I know this is his game and his world and we just get to watch I guess.That is the problem, though, with Tarantino's films: increasingly, and this film seems one more step in this direction, they are becoming insular and narrow depictions of a very clever filmmaker's obsessions, not with truth or beauty or meaning or value or justice or any of the things that the greatest of filmmakers who Tarantino admires but can't approach are after, but merely with the various delights of visceral cinema. As an eclectic film lover I can share and appreciate those delights, and definitely enjoy the ride, but leave from watching his films and definitely this film feeling as if I'd gotten nowhere -- to draw a pretentious metaphor from the central cinematic allusion from this film, what I get from his films is not transcendence but merely empty and gas guzzling mileage toward the vanishing point on a highway that never ends and never gets anywhere. Of course Tarantino never seems to pretends or aspires to more than that -- and I think he'd say, sure you won't get anywhere, but enjoy the ride, at least in this film -- but to some degree you have to measure the greatness of a director by the greatness of his aspirations. I'm not sure &#34;wild and crazy, witty and demented and scary fun&#34; (not to knock that in any way) is the highest of aspirations ... but I've never really seen much more in Tarantino's films and this film in particular.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[1, 5]","Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof, the second film that played after Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror as part of the original theatrical Grindhouse feature, is a brilliant homage and twisted trip to say the least.  Kurt Russell (in a role originally slated for Mickey Rourke) plays the psychotic Stuntman Mike, who doesn't kill his victims with a gun or a knife like a typical serial killer would, but instead he uses his souped up muscle car to stalk and murder his prey, and he does it quite well.  All goes great for Mike until he comes across the wrong group of girls (including Rosario Dawson and stuntwoman Zoe Bell in her acting debut) who strike back in a big way.  While Death Proof is pure Tarantino all the way (the dialogue is top notch and instantly memorable), it's the car crash and chase scenes that are what's worth noting the most.  With some incredible stunt work at his disposal, Tarantino crafts the trashy homage he set out to do, and he does it perfectly.  Also featuring Rose McGowan, Jordan Ladd, Hostel director Eli Roth, and the incredibly hot Vanessa Ferlito.  On a side note, you'll no doubt notice that the negative reviews here are due to the fact that Death Proof and Planet Terror are not being released together on DVD as they were in theaters.  It's a crying shame that this has happened, because this isn't what Tarantino or Rodriguez wanted.

The moment the dialogue kicks in you could swear that the master behind Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs is back on form. In fact, for the first half of this movie, he is, and fans will be very happy that the Tarantino they remembered and loved is back on top form.However, while the second half of the movie contains some interesting performances, for a film that virtually has an all-girl cast, it doesn't match up to the spectacular first hour which is full of hilarious gags (like comments about Stuntman Mike's scar being the result of him falling out of his time machine) and the most violent car crash scene in the history of motion picture smash ups.In a way Death Proof plays more as an ode to movies about cars than it does a Grindhouse B-Movie feature. While that style is presented well for the first hour (jump cuts, dirty reels, hammy direction [that's actually really good], new title replacing the original name of the film, bad edits, bad cuts, bad hairdos) Tarantino looses the feel in the second half, devoting most of his time to a car stunt that is over long and a car chase that is nothing spectacular, with an ending that doesn't really sit well.

Kellner ""PAK""","[0, 0]","Grindhouse Presents, Death Proof - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)Stuntman Mike, a former stuntman and stunt driver has found a new hobby. He likes killing attractive young girls with his custom built stunt car......This movie was pretty bad. I know Quentin Tarantino has made some outstanding movies but this movie is anything but.The Good: The performances given by the actors are pretty solid. The action sequences that there are play well and are entertaining to watch with the exception of the scenes that are way over the top.The Bad: Quentin Tarantino needs to let go of the 70's. I am sure he had a great time in the 70's and feels very nostalgic while looking back but I am willing to bet that the larger portion of the regular movie going population doesn't share his sentiment. His force feeding it down the throats of movie goers doesn't work. An example would be that the story opens up following around a group of 20ish girls as they go to a bar. Not once is a modern song played or listened to by the group and there are a lot of songs played. I am supposed to believe that a group of young girls hangs out all night and not one modern song played? They get in a car to leave and again we get something on the radio from days gone by. It all just feels a little ""Trying too hard"" to me and not believable.I understand that this was something of an homage to the old 70's grind house movies. Honoring old films is fine however the movie needs to be able to stand on its own and not simply be just an homage. This move can't stand alone. If Quentin feels the need to devote so much attention to these types of movie why doesn't he try making a documentary?I don't see the need in intentionally adding in ""Missing reel"" scenes, the rough editing and the worn look of the film. I get it, you are trying to create a feel, but it just doesn't work and again feels like he is trying too hard. Essentially he was trying to make a bad movie and in this he succeeded and some are calling him a genius for it. I am of the opinion that a bad movie is a bad movie whether or not you intended to make it that way.The story overall was extremely boring. 75% of the movie is devoted to the conversations of 4 women none of whom had any redeeming qualities with almost nothing of interest to say with the ending of the movie being the ultimate ""Girl power"" moment. I have no problem with strong female characters but they have to be done the right way and these weren't.Overall: I could go on an on about how poor this movie is. A boring story coupled with annoying characters and a poor attempt at force fed nostalgia. I honestly believe that Quentin Tarantino could film a dog fertilizing a lawn, sell people tickets for $9.50 and people would call him a cinematic genius. If Quentin had put this move out using a pseudonym the same people propping up this film would be tearing it down.

1079892,A1NU6H938LR7I3,B000R7HY0K,Pieter Dams,"[4, 6]","Death Proof is Quentin Tarantino's homage to the B movie genre form the late 60s, 70s and early 80s. Keep this in mind when you watch this film. Like the original low budget flicks, this film has very bad picture quality and sound, terrible editing, silly dialogue, revealing mistakes and bad acting. Of course, these characteristics were all accidental or due to a lack of talent in the original movies, whereas Tarantino has deliberately added these ""mistakes"" in order to recreate the feel of the old films. This might be a bit confusing or even annoying during the first half hour or so, because, unlike 30 years ago, this movie is not shown in a Grindhouse but a modern theater and you can't help but notice that the bad editing is deliberate and therefor misses the charm of the old B movies. Also, the fact that the film is set in 2007 but shot in a way that would be below standard even 30 years ago, slightly removes the charm it would have had, had it been set in the 70s. However, this changes about 30 min into the movie when cell phones, MP3 players and Japanese automobiles are replaced by muscle cars, references to cult classics and John Hughes movies, old school car chases, stunts and your typical Quentin Tarantino dialogues and soundtrack. The uncut European version could have done without some of the more boring conversations at the beginning of the film, though, but Kurt Russell more than makes up for this when he uses his old charm to talk Vanessa Ferlito into a lap dance and by the end of the film real life stunt woman Zoe Bell and Tracie Thoms will have you roaring with laughter as they seek to get even with Stuntman Mike.

He has seen more movies than you, he does have a great eye and ear for capturing old actors and tunes and making them shine, and his dialogue often makes us feel like we aren't just watching a storyline being driven.  That is especially the case here, the first 1 hour and 10 mins or so is flawless homage, beautiful girls, great tunes, weed, Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike and Michael Parks in an amazing sheriff cameo.  Very entertaining and self indulgent but perfect in setting that bar in the rain ambiance.  Then the second hour where for some reason he drops the entire GRINDHOUSE look after a B/W scene.  I don't know why he didn't leave the grimy film effect throughout the entire thing they are in the same time period and it is off putting somewhat.  If he meant to draw a line between the two halves he suceeded, but the girls aren't as fun to watch until the big finale and it doesn't fly by like the first hour.  I suppose the two halves represent the male/female fantasy viewpoint, and maybe Kurt Russell is really just daydreaming until he runs into the girls in the second half.

And let me just say: WOW! WOW!! WOW!!! I fkg LOVE it! Did I say WOW?! Best movie I've seen in ages. True story!From the opening animated credit sequence to the final frame of closing credits, this is such a breathtaking, riveting masterpiece! And there are so many iconic images from everything 1970's drive-in cinema, and includes one of the greatest soundtracks ever committed to film. Tarantino even made use of Pino Donnagio's awesome score from Brian De Palma's ""Blow Out"" (the small piano piece that plays while one of the female characters reads a text message early in the film).Since pretty much every reviewer has mentioned the plot in pretty much every review since the movie came out, I am not gonna bore you with repeating that here. I will, however, say that I have never seen some of these actors in a better film. Ever! This is the best work from Kurt Russell since his glorious work in John Carpenter's classics, like ""Escape From New York"".And every single female in the cast is riveting! (Excuse me if I've used that word already.) Especially Zoe Bell, playing herself. You may recognize Zoe from her stunt work being Uma Thurman's stunt double in Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"". She is simply electrifying as an actress!Anyways, really don't know what else to say except that if you haven't already seen this movie, don't wait another minute: See. It. NOW! And I am gonna go now and watch it again (for the third time since yesterday afternoon).HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

1079913,A3JPPR6JT75N0E,B000R7HY0K,"Rob ""Coolerking""","[4, 5]","I won't go into the clever game of tagging all of Tarantino's references to cult films and music of the past. Suffice it to say, I know where he's been. I saw Vanishing Point four times while it played at my local cinema for a week and couldn't believe it didn't get an R rating for that naked chick (I was 15 back then). When my kids were little I taught them Dave, Dee Dozey, Beaky, Mick, and Titch as a nursery rhyme of sorts. I could go on.In short, this should be my kind of movie. But along with the good, there is bad and ugly in this movie.First, the good. Kurt Russell is excellent as Stuntman Mike. His take on crazy makes me think of where Warren Oates could have taken his character to from Two Lane, Black Top if there had been a sequel. It's a gem of a performance and he's the 440 under the hood that drives this movie. And speaking of driving, that's the real pay-off at the end. It's a magnificent hunter vs. hunted, male vs. female, Russ Meyer vs. Richard Sarafian car chase.Now the bad. So the movie bombed in the theaters. At the time, I blamed that on his market audience just wanting to wait on extended, unrated DVD cuts (like me, except I can use the excuse of there's no theaters in my town). However, there could be another reason. In Pulp Fiction, those profanity-laced endless conversations were quirky and philosophical. What we get in Deathproof is endless, profanity-laced, bitchy, girl talk about who screwed who (please make it STOPPPPPPPP!!!) It gets to the point that the chicks just seem to argue about EVERY FREAKING THING and if only Stuntman Mike would just run them over, I'd buy his blessed pea-pickin' heart a twelve-pack of Rocky Mountain Coors (and not that lite crap). Maybe this is what drove Stuntman Mike crazy to begin with.And now the Ugly. I've shown my kids Le Mans and they are big fans of Bullit. I noted to them that this stuff is the real thing, not CGI like in that incredibly crappy remake of Gone in Sixty Seconds. I grew up in the musclecar era. I had a screaming fast Barracuda. My point is, how could anyone who loves those car DESTROY ABOUT TWO DOZEN OF THEM???? OhMYGTOD, the INHUMANITY!! These babies are not exactly coming off the assembly line anymore. When the stunt crew proudly related how when one Challenger or Charger was damaged, they did the exact same matching damage to the other cars, I realized why some people call for Jihad in this world! This holocaust of Mopar dreamcars is hideous beyond measure (the Nova destruction was ok, because I hate those damn Chevys)! This, my Moparlover brethren, is what takes the joy out of this film. And this calls for action, before it's too late. For decades we have seen the disclaimer, ""no animals were killed or injured...la dee freakin' da"" and of course, it is politically incorrect to smoke (unless it's dope) in current movies. Now Hollywood must come to the realization that it is INHUMANE to damage and destroy Detroit muscle in the making of a film. Movies need to be monitored to see that the use of such wheels as these does not leave a scratch or mar their finish in the least. And as for you, Mr. Tarantino, I hope you don't lose too much sleep at night over every child who will never grow up to own a 1970 Dodge Challenger because you HAD to destroy them in your movie. In the balance, is the world a better place adding Deathproof to our respective Netflix queues or are we worse off for your subtracting the existence of untold number of Challengers and Chargers from our midst?

Noteably, the first female victim and first car crash. The grainy/fake film look worked quite well, but I never really cared about any of the characters in the film.For a film with a very insubstantial plot this was also too long. To justify its current length (110mins) some of Tarantino's trademark dialog could have been cut or replaced with more exploitation! Most genre films of that type were short (e.g. Texas Chainsaw Massacre was under 90mins).Tarantino is a talented director and filmmaker who has a proven record in successfully reinventing old genres.

Regular readers of my reviews will note that I was disgusted by the violence and nihilism of Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" movies.

But before I get into anything, I'd just like to point out that this movie solidly confirms what we'd all suspected since Pulp Fiction, and that is that Tarantino most certainly has a foot fetish.  There are so many shots of feet in this film that you almost(almost) think that the project had started out as a foot fetish porn film that Tarantino might have wanted to do on the side.  With all that aside, the general consensus on Death Proof is that it's a colossal bore.  There are quite a few defenders of the film as well, maybe even moreso than those who didn't like it.  Are people tiring of Tarantino's style or did Tarantino's style just not work this time around?  I'm somewhere in the middle.  I didn't think this was the abysmal failure it's made out to be, nor do I think it's a very good Tarantino film.  I also don't think it's all that great an homage to grindhouse cinema.  Grindhouse films of the 70 were cheap, exploitative, sometimes shocking or groundbreaking, fun, trashy entertainment.  Fast food kinda movies.  Now in Death Proof Tarantino basically made a Tarantino film with a few grindhouse dashes here and there(the music from Dario Argento's Bird With The Crystal Plumage plays while Kurt Russell is photographing his next potential victims like the killer in Argento's film did.  The scene is also shot in the same style.  A nice touch).  Fine.  After all, it is his movie.  By now everyone knows the major criticism of this movie is the constant dialogue and little action.  Personally, I have no problem with movies that take their time getting to where they're going.  Many of the best directors do take their time.  Tarantino himself has made this work for him before.  After all, this is the guy who can take an 80 minute premise and stretch it out to absurd lengths, but manage to keep things interesting.  In the case of Death Proof, it's simply the story of  a vehicular serial killer that finally tangles with the wrong carload of potential victims and has the tables turned on him.  I expected alot of dialogue in this film.  Tarantino himself can't keep his mouth shut, so why should his characters?  My problem didn't come from the dialogue, my problem was that I didn't like a single character in this movie.  Tarantino seemed to find the most irritating and grating women on the planet and stuck them all here.  The few males weren't much better in their small roles(one of them being Tarantino's new bosom buddy, Eli Roth).  I certainly don't get off on real life serial killers, but the great thing about the film world is that you can feel guiltless for rooting for the bad guy.  Killers can be cool in the movies.  I was rooting for Kurt Russell all the way in the hopes that he would put an end to these annoying women.  Speaking of Russell, he's clearly the best actor of the bunch and puts on a good performance.  Personally I didn't like his on a dime turn from macho killer to whining wuss.  People also felt this didn't fit as the second feature on a double bill.  Well, I have no problem with that either coz old grindhouse double features would usually include two films quite different from one another.  On the positive side, I really admire what Tarantino and Rodriguez were trying to accomplish with the Grindhouse project.  It's a great idea and a pity it wasn't a success.  I do feel that Death proof has it's moments, and not just the fleeting violent ones either.  With so many reviews already, I can't add much more to the pile.  All I can say is that I'm glad I saw it and I appreciate the effort even if I wasn't totally thrilled with the results.  In the end I can only suggest that if a person really wants the ""grindhouse"" experience, just rent a ""grindhouse"" movie.  I'd suggest Death Race 2000 if you dig this kinda vehicle carnage.",3,On The Road Again,1200873600,"01 21, 2008",2008,3908,"['Not', 'film', 'review', 'suppose', ""'ll"", 'put', 'two', 'cents', 's', '%', '*ts', 'giggles', 'get', 'anything', ""'d"", 'just', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'movie', 'solidly', 'what', ""'d"", 'suspected', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Tarantino', 'most', 'certainly', 'foot', 'fetish', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'shots', 'feet', 'film', 'almost', 'almost', 'think', 'project', 'had', 'started', 'out', 'foot', 'fetish', 'porn', 'film', 'Tarantino', 'might', 'have', 'wanted', 'do', 'side', 'aside', 'general', 'consensus', 'Death', 'Proof', 'colossal', 'bore', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'defenders', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'maybe', 'even', 'moreso', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'Are', 'people', 'tiring', 'Tarantino', 'style', 'did', 'Tarantino', 'style', 'just', 'not', 'work', 'time', ""'m"", 'somewhere', 'middle', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'abysmal', 'failure', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'do', 'think', 'very', 'good', 'Tarantino', 'film', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'great', 'homage', 'grindhouse', 'cinema', 'Grindhouse', 'films', '70', 'were', 'cheap', 'exploitative', 'sometimes', 'shocking', 'groundbreaking', 'fun', 'trashy', 'entertainment', 'Fast', 'food', 'kinda', 'movies', 'Now', 'Death', 'Proof', 'Tarantino', 'basically', 'made', 'Tarantino', 'film', 'few', 'grindhouse', 'dashes', 'here', 'there', 'music', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'Bird', 'Crystal', 'Plumage', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'photographing', 'next', 'potential', 'victims', 'killer', 'Argento', 'film', 'did', 'scene', 'also', 'shot', 'same', 'style', 'nice', 'touch', 'Fine', 'movie', 'now', 'everyone', 'major', 'criticism', 'movie', 'constant', 'dialogue', 'little', 'action', 'Personally', 'have', 'problem', 'movies', 'take', 'time', 'getting', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'Many', 'best', 'directors', 'do', 'take', 'time', 'Tarantino', 'made', 'work', 'before', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'take', '80', 'minute', 'premise', 'stretch', 'out', 'absurd', 'lengths', 'manage', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'case', 'Death', 'Proof', 'simply', 'story', 'vehicular', 'serial', 'killer', 'finally', 'wrong', 'carload', 'potential', 'victims', 'tables', 'turned', 'expected', 'alot', 'dialogue', 'film', 'Tarantino', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'mouth', 'shut', 'so', 'why', 'should', 'characters', 'problem', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'dialogue', 'problem', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'single', 'character', 'movie', 'Tarantino', 'seemed', 'find', 'most', 'irritating', 'grating', 'women', 'planet', 'stuck', 'here', 'few', 'males', 'were', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'small', 'roles', 'one', 'being', 'Tarantino', 'new', 'bosom', 'buddy', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'off', 'real', 'life', 'serial', 'killers', 'great', 'thing', 'film', 'world', 'can', 'feel', 'guiltless', 'rooting', 'bad', 'guy', 'Killers', 'can', 'be', 'cool', 'movies', 'was', 'rooting', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'way', 'hopes', 'would', 'put', 'end', 'annoying', 'women', 'Speaking', 'Russell', 'clearly', 'best', 'actor', 'bunch', 'good', 'performance', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'dime', 'turn', 'macho', 'killer', 'whining', 'wuss', 'People', 'also', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'second', 'feature', 'double', 'bill', 'Well', 'have', 'problem', 'coz', 'old', 'grindhouse', 'double', 'features', 'would', 'usually', 'include', 'two', 'films', 'quite', 'different', 'one', 'positive', 'side', 'really', 'admire', 'what', 'Tarantino', 'Rodriguez', 'were', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'Grindhouse', 'project', 'great', 'idea', 'pity', 'was', ""n't"", 'success', 'do', 'feel', 'Death', 'proof', 'moments', 'not', 'just', 'fleeting', 'violent', 'ones', 'either', 'so', 'many', 'reviews', 'already', 'ca', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'more', 'pile', 'can', 'say', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', 'appreciate', 'effort', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'totally', 'thrilled', 'results', 'end', 'can', 'only', 'suggest', 'person', 'really', 'grindhouse', 'experience', 'just', 'rent', 'grindhouse', 'movie', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'Death', 'Race', '2000', 'dig', 'kinda', 'vehicle', 'carnage']",Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof

1079938,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000R7HY0K,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[2, 3]","'Stalk And Crash' might describe this half of the 2007 Grind House double bill, in which the deranged 'Stuntman Mike' (brilliantly played by Kurt Russell) targets and kills young women by running them over with his custom-built high-speed automobile.  It's as bizarre and over-the-top as the Grind House duology aimed to be, sometimes almost surreally so, and it achieves a successful blend of the horror thriller and the 'fast cars and open road' action movie.Death Proof is told in two halves, taking place about eighteen months apart I believe, but in the first half it almost appears to be taking place in the 1970s (the decade the movie takes most of its inspiration from) despite the prescence of modern devices such as cell phones, and the film quality is scratched up and sometimes hazy, sometimes cutting out altogether, as if it's trying to achieve the look of a film reel that's been making its rounds from theater to theater from 1972 straight through to the modern day and has taken a pounding along the way.  The second half, which has a much more modern feel and a clean, well-produced look, juts out in stark contrast, as if a sequel to the original half was filmed ages later on a bigger budget.  Oddly enough, it works.  Both halves follow Russell's psychopath character as he targets different groups of girls for death on the road, but in one half it quickly becomes apparant that Stuntman Mike may have selected the wrong group of 'victims'.  Great casting all around (including one of my personal favorite actresses, Mary Elizabeth Winstead), great use of music, terrific action sequences, great dialogue, a sharp wit,and a wickedly sexy vibe during much of the movie, make this one a real winner and the strongest of the two Grind House features (although Planet Terror was pretty good too).  Biggest complaint - between both features, we still don't get all of the fake trailers that were included in the theatrical release (although at least we get 'Machete' with Danny Trejo, which should Definately be made into a full-length movie).",4,Totally Unique 'Stalk-And-Crash' Action-Horror,1240704000,"04 26, 2009",2009,2060,"[""'Stalk"", 'Crash', 'might', 'describe', 'half', '2007', 'Grind', 'House', 'double', 'bill', 'deranged', 'Mike', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'targets', 'kills', 'young', 'women', 'running', 'custom-built', 'high-speed', 'automobile', 'bizarre', 'over-the-top', 'Grind', 'House', 'duology', 'aimed', 'be', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'surreally', 'so', 'successful', 'blend', 'horror', 'thriller', ""'fast"", 'cars', 'open', 'road', 'action', 'movie.Death', 'Proof', 'told', 'two', 'halves', 'taking', 'place', 'eighteen', 'months', 'apart', 'believe', 'first', 'half', 'almost', 'be', 'taking', 'place', '1970s', 'decade', 'movie', 'most', 'inspiration', 'prescence', 'modern', 'devices', 'such', 'cell', 'phones', 'film', 'quality', 'scratched', 'up', 'sometimes', 'hazy', 'sometimes', 'cutting', 'out', 'altogether', 'trying', 'achieve', 'look', 'film', 'reel', 'been', 'making', 'rounds', 'theater', 'theater', '1972', 'straight', 'modern', 'day', 'taken', 'pounding', 'way', 'second', 'half', 'much', 'more', 'modern', 'feel', 'clean', 'well-produced', 'look', 'out', 'stark', 'contrast', 'sequel', 'original', 'half', 'was', 'filmed', 'ages', 'later', 'bigger', 'budget', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'halves', 'follow', 'Russell', 'psychopath', 'character', 'different', 'groups', 'girls', 'death', 'road', 'one', 'half', 'quickly', 'apparant', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'may', 'have', 'selected', 'wrong', 'group', ""'victims"", 'Great', 'casting', 'including', 'one', 'personal', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'great', 'use', 'music', 'terrific', 'action', 'sequences', 'great', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'wit', 'wickedly', 'sexy', 'vibe', 'much', 'movie', 'make', 'one', 'real', 'winner', 'strongest', 'two', 'Grind', 'House', 'Planet', 'Terror', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'Biggest', 'complaint', 'features', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'fake', 'trailers', 'were', 'included', 'theatrical', 'release', 'least', 'get', ""'Machete"", 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'should', 'Definately', 'be', 'made', 'full-length', 'movie']",Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof

1079949,A2EY2RBD9C3ZIR,B000R7HY0K,The Seeker,"[0, 1]","Directed and written by Quentin Tarantino in 2007, ""Death Proof"" stars legendary Hollywood tough guy Kurt Russell who plays the part of an aging and misogynist serial killer named ""Stuntman Mike"".THE PLOT:A mysterious, demented, and scarred drifter who claims to be an ex-stuntman in movies goes from city-to-city and stalks and kill posse's of young women for sport. Only he uses a car instead of say a knife to kill women. He drives a stunt car that he claims is ""100% death proof"" and he uses the car to crash into, and kill his victims, and since he drives a stunt car, he lives through the crashes and the rush of it all sexually excites him.MY THOUGHTS:""Death Proof"" is a slasher movie/chick flick. Most of the movie is just groups of young women talking. The violence builds up, and the movie has Quentin Tarantino's own unique style added to it. I'm a huge Kurt Russell and Quentin Tarantino fan, and seeing these two combine their styles together was literally a dream come true for me. There's a whole other audience out there that doesn't know who Kurt Russell is, or what he can do, and this movie shows those people just that. This was a role Kurt Russell was born to play. For years, I hoped to see Kurt Russell in a Tarantino film in a ""Snake Plissken/Jack Burton"" sort of role and that's exactly what we get in ""Death Proof"".WHO I THINK WILL ENJOY THIS:Women for sure. ""Death Proof"" is a chick flick in disguise. Infact, it's a violent chick flick, but it's not overly violent, nor is it overly gory. I actually think this movie is a really good film for girls ages 13 and older to watch, as well as girls/women who normally don't want to watch horror movies because ""Death Proof"" is not too scary. ""Death Proof"" also pays homage to drive-in theater/grindhouse movies of the 1970's, as well as early 1980's horror movies, so if you like films like that, you'll most likely also enjoy ""Death Proof"".WHO I THINK WILL NOT LIKE THIS FILM -People who don't like too much talking in their movies, and people who don't like to wait for violence and scary scenes to be built up. ""Death Proof"" is not nearly as violent as some of Quentin Tarantino's other movies, so some people may not like that. Macho tough guys and tomboys may not like the film either since it's very pro-women. Almost all the men characters are shown in a bad light too.FINAL THOUGHTS -""Death Proof"" is a popcorn and soda film, and a girl power movie. It's also a hang-out film because whenever you watch it, it's like your hanging out with the characters. It's the type of film you can watch over and over again just so you can hang out with those characters. It's great to watch with your friends on a Friday or Saturday night. There's a lot of great timeless classic rock and classic movie instrumental soundtracks we hear through out the movie that I enjoyed a lot.The film features one of Kurt Russell's finest performances, it is a fun, and entertaining film, and one of my favorite movies.

1079950,A3M7RECGYLXOPA,B000R7HY0K,The Wickerman,"[1, 2]","Quentin Tarantino's contribution to the ""Grind House"" project is nothing short of a mile-a-minute thrill ride.  From beginning to end, it's just nonstop excitement, and tons of fun.  It's a bit more straight-forward than your average QT film.  The plot is pretty simple, and doesn't skip around chronologically, and the experimental camera effects are kept to a minimum (with only a grainy, retro-70's picture quality, and one scene that inexplicably switches to black and white).  However, most of the usual ""Tarantisms"" are there, like the excellent dialogue and random pop culture references, the campy, over-the-top violence, and of course the obligatory nod to Quentin's foot fetish.So, the story we have here is about a fellow named Stuntman Mike, a crazed ex-stunt driver who preys upon young women, using as his weapon of choice a tricked-out muscle car that is 100% ""death proof""....at least to him, anyway.  Mike carves a bloody trail across the countryside, until he meets his match in a group of young stuntwomen with a few skills of their own.  What ensues is one of the greatest car chases I have ever seen, right up there with the famous train scene in ""The French Connection"".  It's surprisingly long, but never too long.  Even more amazing is the incredible Zoe Bell, who actually spends half of this scene clinging to the hood of a speeding car that is wildly careening and colliding with the other vehicle.  This is one tough chick.And of course Kurt Russell is fantastic as Mike.  He's creepy and terrifying, yet still oddly likable.  With all the more family-oriented movies he's been moving toward in the past few years, it's really great to see him play this type of role again.  He may be getting up there in age, but he's definitely still got it.Yep, this one is highly recommended for sure.  It probably won't be winning any Oscars, but it's a fun action flick that never feels mindless or dumb.  I was disappointed that this one and ""Planet Terror"" weren't released as a single package, but oh well.

The much-anticipated lap-dance sequence is hot and worth waiting for.Watching the film again, you better appreciate both groups of girls.

1079954,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B000R7HY0K,trashcanman,"[374, 468]","First, a word about this childish boycott. ""Grindhouse"" gave us two brilliant genre films for the price of one in the theaters. It was a once in a lifetime experience for most of us and a chance to see the two most bada$* directors in Hollywood give us 3+ hours of hardcore horror/exploitation entertainment including the funniest faux-trailers you're likely to ever see (or not see if you missed it). And it bombed. Big time. Why? Because lazy America said it'd wait for the DVD because both films together were too long and they lost the chance to support a truly brilliant idea and show that we are sick and tired of cardboard cutout PG-13 teen horror and bad remakes of beloved cult classics. They went to see ""Disturbia"" instead. ""Grindhouse"" was what true horror fans -hell, what all true film fanatics- have been dying for and shame on all of you who missed it. So the studio took a loss for taking a chance on this idea and as a result, they've split the two films up with extra scenes that were cut for time and are giving us these two films as we haven't yet seen them, each in double-disc editions packed with extras. Awesome, right? Weeeeeellllll, now the same whiners who stiffed the films in the theaters are angry they missed out and want both films on one DVD (as if there'd even be room) for a discount price. Sorry, but it don't work that way. The theatrical cut was packaged as just that, an experience for the theaters simulating the double-feature drive-in days of old. Even if that experience would translate to DVD, why would the company re-release it in the same form that already failed miserably? The bottom line is this: we now have another chance to show that THIS is what we as horror fans want to see and the only way to do that is to buy these great-looking DVDs. The notion that making the films bomb yet again on DVD is going to lead to some super-duper deluxe theatrical edition must have been conceived in the mind of a five year old on crack. If we don't support these editions, these films will die and the studio will waste no more money on this failed project or any like it in the future. This is basic business sense. Support true horror and other genre films and boycott crappy remakes and bloated sequels *cough*Spiderman3*cough* instead.  YOu know you'll double-dip on those.""Death Proof"" was Quentin Tarantino's half of the ""Grindhouse"" experience.  It's a film of stunning originality that switches gears between genres seamlessly and, in true Tarantino fashion, pays tribute to it's influences all the way going so far as to name the films it strives to emulate.  ""Planet Terror"", Robert Rodriguez's zombie-heavy gorefest that served as the other half of ""Grindhouse"", captured the spirit of exploitation cinema by being over-the-top and silly, but ""Death Proof"" pays homage to it while building a more subtle, character-driven masterpiece.  Kurt Russell plays an old stunt driver with a car built so that the driver can not be killed no matter how bad he crashes (death proof, see?).  Well, the guy is a bit of a misogynistic bastard (and a wuss at that) and he gets his jollies by murdering young, beautiful women, possibly as a way of getting back at a world that doesn't share his enthusiasm for -or even a vague awareness of- the carphilic genre films that make up his very existence.  His weapon of choice?  His stunt car, of course. They crash, he lives, they die.  There is an amazing scene where a crash with a car full of girls is replayed over-and-over, each repeat focusing on a different girl and her particular gory demise.  Unbelievable.  The girls are all well fleshed-out as characters with lives and personalities of their own and you just don't know who will live and die.  You cheer when they live, you gasp (and then cheer at the way it was filmed) when they die; a win-win situation.Rose McGownan is indeed the grindhouse queen as she co-stars in both films and steals the show in every scene she appears in.  Real-life stuntwoman Zoe Bell makes her acting debut and proves an impossibly endearing on-screen presence who shall henceforth be known as Spiderwoman to me after her incredible stuntwork here.  Rosario Dawson charms as always and the rest of the cast is beyond solid as well.The last twenty minutes of ""Death Proof"" are among the greatest of any film I've ever seen.  Edge of your seat barely begins to describe the chase sequences and the finale had me literally applauding in the theater as I laughed myself silly.  You will not see the ending coming unless you've see or heard about it already.  The rest of the film is splattered with homages and references to classic drive-in fare, humorous and profane dialogue, horror cliches (horny + stoned + female = splat!), and more QT goodness.This extended cut features the infamous ""reel missing"" scene featuring a very sexy lapdance and more of the film's awesome music.  There is also a black-and-white sequence where Russell and Dawson indulge in Tarantino's creepy foot fetish and a hilarious convenience store scene which stars the almost undrinkable ""Big Red"" soda in damn near every shot.  I laughed harder every time the camera focused on the offending soft drink.  The special features are impressive; the highlight for me was watching goretastic horror director Eli Roth plead with Kurt Russell in-between takes where Roth's character had to diss the horror legend.Buy this film, buy ""Planet Terror"" (there is a $5 off coupon for it included here if that helps), and wave your copies at the moron down the street who's boycotting because this is brilliant filmmaking and denying yourself this kind of entertainment over sour grapes is self-punishment.""Hey Ladies.....

It could have been a spectacular film, especially with the way talented Kurt Russell handled his role as the automobile-homicidal killer, but the lengthy dialog was brutal.  The topics that were being discussed for time unending were nonsensical and had absolutely nothing to do with the movie.  Through conversations galore you learn all about a few girls and their lives, not to be set up for something in the plot that pertains to their conversations, but to have them killed moments later in a mere few seconds.  What seemed like hours upon hours of dreadful dialog and tiny amounts of action led to the two stars above. The car chase made the one star a two for me.This movie was simply ridiculous and a total waste of time!  Quentin Tarantino is too in love with himself to film a movie the proper way (with less meaningless dialog and a hint of suspense).Here's one for ya Quentin, why don't you stop doing tributes to other dated film eras and do something creative, original, and up to par with today's film genres!

1079960,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B000R7HY0K,V. Berk,"[4, 7]","Death Proof and the Grindhouse Double-Feature are of course Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriquez's tribute to the junk films that used to be played in exploitation theaters through the 60s and 70s.  For once Tarantino actually decides that he's going to stick to one cinematic style from beginning to end of the film.  Tarantino decides that with Death Proof he will PERFECTLY imitate the feel of these trash movies.  Boy does Tarantino succeed at doing just that.  In fact he does it so well that it becomes the movie's central problem!  I know it sounds contradictory for me to complain about his lack of directorial focus only to instantly complain about how he sticks to a single style during Death Proof.  Just hear me out before you come to any conclusions.The frames are damaged, full of grain, becoming dead on imitations of junk films both visually and thematically.  Both Tarantino's Death Proof and Robert Rodriquez's Planet Terror (the other feature from Grindhouse) use this style...One key difference.  Planet Terror is so over the top that it becomes a BLAST; not a perfect or even a good film, but certainly deserving of a 7/10 star rating simply for its entertainment value.  Death Proof on the other hand is very down to earth in its premise and without many exaggerated stylistic choices just becomes what it set out to be: a trashy, boring film.As a story it is generic (as it should be) following a group of girls stalked by a man named ""Stuntman Mike"" (Kurt Russell) who drives a ""death proof"" retired stunt car.  He stalks them, kills them with his car, then skips state to repeat the process elsewhere.  He is a fun character speaking in a pleasant Southern drawl, passing himself off as a nice guy.  Too bad he has little screen time compared to our three female protagonists who are boring as can be.  I kept checking the clock wondering how long it would take these bimbos to become street pizza!  After a bar sequence that seems to go on forever (where I have to admit, Tarantino's cameo as the manager is the second most entertaining aspect of this film right after Kurt Russell)I have to admit the stunts in this film really are remarkable.  Stuntman Mike isn't joking about his set of wheels given that all the chases in this film are for real.  When he talks about what a shame it is to have lost the old time values of using real cars and stuntmen over CGI crashes it really shows.  Nothing can top the thrill of seeing real vehicles getting, smashed, slammed, and creating mayhem.  No computer program can compare to live action.After a thrilling stunt where Stuntman Mike kills a group of girls through a straight on collision (while Tarantino delivers the promised Grindhouse style gore) we are greeted to a cameo from by the cops from Kill Bill before moving on to the second act.  This is where things really begin to fall apart.  For the most part the second half seems a poor excuse to show off Tarantino's lead Kill Bill stuntwoman Zo Bell's skill as she hangs for dear life on the hood of a car during a chase.Like Kill Bill, Vol.2 the second half of this film is so different than the first that it seems to be something entirely different.  Stuntman Mike who is an intimidating, soft-spoken stalker in the first half suddenly becomes an obnoxious over actor.  Now I have no problem, because Kurt Russell hamming it up certainly was amusing for awhile, but it was very out of place given how calm his character was during the first half of the film.  Over the top or serious Tarantino, you have to choose one or the other and stick with it!Speaking of the acting it really is a wonder as Tarantino, to preserve the concept of this being a junk film intentionally baits the cast to do stupid, amateur stunts such as looking directly into the camera for entire scenes at a time, breaking the fourth wall, and just being general hams.  Nothing can be much funnier than a truly awful movie, but the film actually had to be completely unaware of how bad it is.  Death Proof it is clearly intentional, and though this might be amusing when a viewer first notices these quirks, the gag soon loses charm and just becomes annoying.  When you see bad films you want to see a bad film.  You don't want to see an obviously smart director and actors being led to intentionally look bad.  They aren't over the top (until the final ten minutes or so of the movie) so they're just boring.Another problem is the script.  Tarantino is not a great director on a visual level seeing as most of the time he replicates the styles of great directors.  What has always set Tarantino apart as an artist is his engaging dialogue.  That's where Grindhouse is a disappointment of colossal proportions.  There is very little action in Death Proof, which is good seeing as Tarantino isn't that good with action scenes, but the dialogue in the film is just...boring.  It's as real as it gets.  No, seriously: the dialogue in this film is as entertaining as stalking an actual troop of girls.  Only good dialogue comes from Kurt Russell during the first half, but then Tarantino butchers the appeal of that character in the second act.  If you're not enjoying the dialogue of a Tarantino film it means something is going horribly wrong.So congratulations to Mister Tarantino for successfully making the junk film he set out to make.  No doubt this was an entertaining thing for him as a director, but as an audience member I was often bored with this film.  The action is fun, but the final car chase goes on for far too long, but worse is that Tarantino's dialogue in Death Proof is just bland.  There is nothing really working for this film.  It could have been far better if Tarantino had made this a more exaggerated homage because as it is it's no different than the bad films it tries to poke fun at.  Planet Terror managed to give that bad movie feel while taking its premise to such absurdity that it was hard not to be entertained by it.  Death Proof on the other hand is so serious about being ""bad"" that it becomes just that.My Rating: 5/10 StarsMy Verdict: While possessing some of Quentin Tarantino's strengths, Death Proof ultimately succeeds in becoming EXACTLY what it set out to homage and parody; due to knowing that was Tarantino's intention Death Proof ultimately loses the fun of an actual bad movie.  As a viewer I can only hope that from this point on Tarantino can try to focus more on creating his own (very successful, mind you) genre of films.  I'd like to see him make an actual full-fledged western in the style of Sergio Leone - maybe even con Clint Eastwood to cameo, but he needs to steer away from making ""intentionally bad films"".

1079966,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B000R7HY0K,Wesley Mullins,"[0, 2]","Death Proof is Quentin Tarantino's contribution to the Grindhouse double feature, an unapologetic embrace of low budget exploitation films that played in drive-ins throughout the 60s and 70s.  Heavy on ""royal with cheese"" dialogue and chalked full of some of Hollywood's best eye candy, Death Proof unmistakenly wears the fingerprints of its creator.  Taking his homage as far as he can go, Tarantino also recreates the hisses, pops, cigarette burns, missing/repeated frames and audio inconsistencies common during the drive-in era.Despite the dozen or so scream queen roles that Tarantino no doubt wrote into the script so he could fill them with a casting couch, Death Proof's star is Kurt Russell, the mysterious Stunt Man Mike, an ageing scarred Elvis Man who drives around in a stunt car built to survive any accident.  Since Stunt Man Mike knows he can live though any crash with this ""Death Proof"" car, he uses his automobile as a weapon to mow down Tarantino's titillating temptresses.  Death Proof does not explain why Stuntman Mike does what he does, instead relying on the audience to accept the simplistic, one dimensional nature of classic exploitation horror films.  Stunt Man Mike kills people...enough said.After what appears to have been a long life of automobile decapitations and mutilations, Stunt Man Mike seems to meet his match when he targets a car full of female stunt drivers, a duel which manifests into a car war that would make James Dean, Gene Hackman and The Dukes of Hazzard all jealous.  The last half of Death Proof features some of the most unbelievable stunt work ever captured on screen, highlighted by Zoe Bell (real life stuntwoman playing herself) slipping and spinning on her car's hood at terrifying speeds.As with most of his work in the last decade and a half, Tarantino is more concerned with having fun than with recreating the brilliance of his early films.  Nothing in Death Proof is meant to challenge the White/Pink bantering from Reservoir Dogs or the Christopher Walken scenes from True Romance or Pulp Fiction.  He's not making those kind of movies anymore.  Instead, Tarantino is like a Senior who only needs a few electives to graduate and spends his last semester taking swimming and ballroom dancing.  He's done all the hard work and now just wants to have a good time.  With Death Proof, Tarantino clearly achieves that goal...and audiences who understand his intentions will enjoy the ride.",4,Tarantino Having Fun,1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,2449,"['Death', 'Proof', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'contribution', 'Grindhouse', 'double', 'feature', 'unapologetic', 'embrace', 'low', 'budget', 'exploitation', 'films', 'played', 'drive-ins', '60s', '70s', 'Heavy', 'royal', 'cheese', 'dialogue', 'chalked', 'full', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'eye', 'candy', 'Death', 'Proof', 'unmistakenly', 'fingerprints', 'creator', 'Taking', 'homage', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'go', 'Tarantino', 'also', 'hisses', 'pops', 'cigarette', 'burns', 'missing/repeated', 'frames', 'audio', 'inconsistencies', 'common', 'drive-in', 'era.Despite', 'dozen', 'so', 'scream', 'queen', 'roles', 'Tarantino', 'doubt', 'wrote', 'script', 'could', 'fill', 'casting', 'couch', 'Death', 'Proof', 'star', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'mysterious', 'Stunt', 'Man', 'Mike', 'ageing', 'scarred', 'Elvis', 'Man', 'who', 'around', 'stunt', 'car', 'built', 'survive', 'accident', 'Stunt', 'Man', 'Mike', 'can', 'live', 'crash', 'Death', 'Proof', 'car', 'automobile', 'weapon', 'mow', 'down', 'Tarantino', 'titillating', 'temptresses', 'Death', 'Proof', 'not', 'explain', 'why', 'Stuntman', 'Mike', 'what', 'instead', 'relying', 'audience', 'accept', 'simplistic', 'one', 'dimensional', 'nature', 'classic', 'exploitation', 'horror', 'films', 'Stunt', 'Man', 'Mike', 'people', 'enough', 'said.After', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'long', 'life', 'automobile', 'decapitations', 'mutilations', 'Stunt', 'Man', 'Mike', 'meet', 'match', 'when', 'car', 'full', 'female', 'stunt', 'drivers', 'duel', 'car', 'war', 'would', 'make', 'James', 'Dean', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'jealous', 'last', 'half', 'Death', 'Proof', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'stunt', 'work', 'ever', 'captured', 'screen', 'highlighted', 'Zoe', 'Bell', 'real', 'life', 'stuntwoman', 'playing', 'slipping', 'spinning', 'car', 'hood', 'terrifying', 'speeds.As', 'most', 'work', 'last', 'decade', 'half', 'Tarantino', 'more', 'concerned', 'having', 'fun', 'recreating', 'brilliance', 'early', 'films', 'Nothing', 'Death', 'Proof', 'meant', 'challenge', 'White/Pink', 'bantering', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'scenes', 'True', 'Romance', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'not', 'making', 'kind', 'movies', 'anymore', 'Instead', 'Tarantino', 'Senior', 'who', 'only', 'few', 'electives', 'graduate', 'last', 'semester', 'taking', 'swimming', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'done', 'hard', 'work', 'now', 'just', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'Death', 'Proof', 'Tarantino', 'clearly', 'goal', 'audiences', 'who', 'understand', 'intentions', 'will', 'enjoy', 'ride']",Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof

1079968,A3A2ABYD39MTTK,B000R7HY0K,Y. Nomura,"[3, 6]","So this movie was a double feature with Rodriguez's Planet Terror and usually Rogdriguez's films are pretty bad, enjoyable but bad. The results for Rodriguez's Planet Terror were basically as usual, maybe a little better, but the unfortunate thing For Tarantino was that his part, which is Death Proof, was so bad it actually made Planet Terror seem like a classic. Yes, being a big Tarantino fan who has enjoyed every single film he has made up until this point, it was something of the unexpected but frankly speaking, Death Proof was so darn boring. Usually the long dialogue is a major part of where his movies shine but here, it's just plain stupid nonsense going on forever, it's not interesting at all. And at the very very end, like for 20 minutes or so we get this chase scene which doesn't come near as close to covering up for the lame hour long crap we had to endure up until then. The people who have enjoyed this movie I believe are only the people who were able to enjoy the long dialogue scenes which in my opinon was not the same case compared to previous Tarantino classics. The dialogue scenes were so bad, I really had a hard time staying awake and that wasn't because I was in bad shape when viewing this, actually quite the opposite so that should give you an idea of how bad this movie is. I recall that this Grindhouse double feature totally flopped at the theaters and those who have seen this all know why it did so bad. I have a very open mind even for bad movies but man, this movie is as boring as films can get.
