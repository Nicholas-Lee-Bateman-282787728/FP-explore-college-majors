This over 4 1/2 hours (13 episodes)plays out like a great 13 part storyThis story arc is a darker TMNT than normal. Over 13 weeks (spisodes), it loses impact and emotional content. The animation is good, but as good as cartoon is..if the story isnt good, the greatest anime cant cover it!To reveal the storyline would spoil the adventure. I am older than the kids who watch this on fox tv, but this kept me riveted, when watched all at once. Now on DVD, this 13 part storyline can be watched all at once.

Again, stellar animation w/ a solid story that pretty much flows like one long film if you exclude the theme song & ending credits. As much as I enjoyed the now classic show, this new series is a lot better for so many reasons. The only true downside to this collection is there are ABSOLUTELY no special features.

Milazzo,"[7, 8]","If you enjoyed watching ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" by FoxKids on Cheez TV and Toasted TV (etc.) but was disappointed by the (last) ""Ninja Tribunal"" episode of Season 4 before ""Fast Forward"" played like me, well . . . that season has just about been completed and will be released onto DVD (as you can see above).This never-before-seen season box set takes place after the Turtles and 4 other human warriors have been taken by 4 Shredder look-a-likes on a ship to Japan for some intense training to, as was briefly explained But Never Fully revealed as Before, combat a ""Great Evil"", as well as resolve the Mystic Foots' (5 mini-Shredders with elemental powers - earth, fire, wind, water & metal) attempt to resurrect the true Shredder.Any other information related to this season can be found at Wikipedia, as well as info on another episode from this same season.  From the episodes and summaries listed, it sounds a bit darker than before . . .Naturally, as this season was incomplete and therefore never shown before (except for demand on ""selected"" channels), all detailed information shall be revealed upon its release and purchase by fans.Despite the fact that I have never seen an episode before nor can tell what really happens, and probably not worthy to review an item pre-release, a NEW TMNT TV Season (almost) fully released on DVD is WORTH a full rating.  The long wait shall be over soon . . .*Sigh*, If only this sort of treatment (completing an unfinished season of an animated series) was also done with the 2002/Mike Young Productions' ""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"".  THAT would be great!This season has just recently started showing on Toasted TV!  Aside from answering ""What happened to the Turtles next?"", this season also originates (therefore answering a lot of curious things and gives explanations) what would be mentioned or briefly seen in ""Fast-Forward"" (except for the change of animation style, which will happen again in Season 7):* Why is Michaelangelo's Turtle Titan costume different?* What is the tension between Master Splinter and the Tribunal?* Why were there so many people fighting together in the Justice Force?This DVD answers all these questions and more!

Harris ""Steve Harris""","[0, 0]","While this was better known as the `Lost Episodes', and were finally aired in early 2008 then on DVD not long after it aired on television.  While this is only half the episodes that made up any of the first `4' seasons of this new series that started in 2003, though that I feel that this season doesn't miss a beat whatsoever.  The turtles have to face their most deadliest of enemies but in order to defeat him they have been called upon what is known as the `Ninja Tribunal' to help prepare them along with others to defeat this powerful enemy.  Not long after their training had begun, 4 heralds had resurrected their master and brought him back to the earth unleashing what he can unto the earth and the first choice he makes is to take New York City, home of the turtles.  While the turtles feel that they're alone in fighting this `demon' but in the end they have to call upon former enemies as alliances to help fight him.

1145638,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B0014567V6,Simon,"[10, 11]","Two years ago, season 4 of TMNT ended on a cliffhanger with our boys in green shipped off to Japan to fight an ancient evil (the original, demon Shredder). Faster than you can say ""toy sales,"" 4Kids pulled a switch and aired ""Fast Forward"" instead, banishing these ""lost episodes"" to brief on demand showings and overseas markets. Now with Fast Forward over and the series being retooled again, North American audiences are getting The Ninja Tribunal saga for the first time. As I write this the final few episodes are airing on TV, but they'll all be collected in this set.This is solid Ninja Turtles, though it doesn't quite hit the heights of the series' best. As the season was only 13 episodes instead of the usual 26, a lot of ""fat"" has been trimmed from the storytelling and every episode furthers the main plot while also being action-packed. The result is a roller coaster ride that takes the Turtles from New York to Japan and back to New York, has them forming alliances with new allies and old enemies, and gaining mystical medallions that turn them into dragons.Yes, dragons. Taking a cue from current anime shows, the Turtles need to ""power up"" to the next level with mystical energies, weapons, and transformations. It's actually used to good effect where needed, though you'll still be glad these powers don't last beyond this story arc. Otherwise, the series has always had its problems with pacing, characterizations, and cop-outs; this season is no different, and some intense moments are weakened by what was probably a network decision to play safe; they may be Ninja Turtles, but the show's still for kids.But overall, this is still a more-than-worthy purchase for fans. These were the last episodes to be produced in the original '2K3' art style, and bring that chapter of TMNT to a fitting close while keeping the doors open to Fast Forward and beyond. It doesn't live up to two years' worth of hype, but what possibly could?
