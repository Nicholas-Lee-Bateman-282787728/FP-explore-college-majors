The other three episodes on here (Great White Shark Uncaged, Blood In The Water, Ultimate Air Jaws) are fine enough, but I primarily bought this set to get my hands on the Mythbusters Shark Week Special.I'm a huge Mythbusters fan and have been trying to get my hands on all their episodes, so this seemed like an economical way to get the &#34;Shark Week Special&#34; into my collection.  Unfortunately, and for anyone who's trying to do the same thing, you should be aware that the version of the Mythbuster's Shark Week Special on here is an edited version that 's only half as long as the normal one.  YES, it's only half the episode!  Imagine my shock to find out that half the special was missing!I've since done a bit more research and discovered that you can get the proper full episode on the &#34;Shark Week: Great Bites Collection&#34;.  Aside from that, even if you're not specifically a Mythbusters fan and just want to watch shark-related shows, you'd get a better value for your money choosing some other Shark Week collection, such as the &#34;20th Anniversary Collection&#34; which has many more episodes on it than this.  Either way, whether you're a Mythbusters fan or a shark fan, I can't recommend this DVD at all - there's better options out there.",2,The Mythbuster's Episode Isn't Complete!!!,1395014400,"03 17, 2014",2014,1398,"[""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'huge', 'fan', 'Shark', 'Week', 'anything', 'mean', 'okay', 'so', 'actually', 'bought', 'Mythbusters', 'episode', 'other', 'three', 'episodes', 'here', 'Great', 'White', 'Shark', 'Uncaged', 'Blood', 'Water', 'Ultimate', 'Air', 'Jaws', 'are', 'fine', 'enough', 'primarily', 'bought', 'set', 'get', 'hands', 'Mythbusters', 'Shark', 'Week', 'Special.I', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Mythbusters', 'fan', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'get', 'hands', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'economical', 'way', 'get', '34', 'Shark', 'Week', 'Special', '34', 'collection', 'Unfortunately', 'anyone', 'who', 'trying', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'version', 'Mythbuster', 'Shark', 'Week', 'Special', 'here', 'edited', 'version', 'only', 'half', 'as', 'long', 'normal', 'one', 'YES', 'only', 'episode', 'Imagine', 'shock', 'find', 'out', 'special', 'was', 'missing', ""'ve"", 'done', 'bit', 'more', 'research', 'discovered', 'can', 'get', 'proper', 'full', 'episode', '34', 'Shark', 'Week', 'Great', 'Bites', 'Collection', '34', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'specifically', 'Mythbusters', 'fan', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'shark-related', 'shows', ""'d"", 'get', 'better', 'value', 'money', 'choosing', 'other', 'Shark', 'Week', 'collection', 'such', '34', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'Collection', '34', 'many', 'more', 'episodes', 'way', ""'re"", 'Mythbusters', 'fan', 'shark', 'fan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'DVD', 'better', 'options', 'there']",N/A

The 20th Anniversary DVD set was great it had a ton of episodes and was a box set.  Not that they need to do a big box set every anniversary but this is just a bad release 4 episodes and 3 of them are on other Shark Week releases so really if you are a fan and have the others like I do you are buying it just for Great White:Uncaged.,1,Very disappointing,1344643200,"08 11, 2012",2012,465,"['1', 'Start', 'release', 'episodes', 'are', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'DVD', 'nice', 'mix', 'episodes', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'great', 'had', 'ton', 'episodes', 'was', 'box', 'set', 'Not', 'need', 'do', 'big', 'box', 'set', 'anniversary', 'just', 'bad', 'release', '4', 'episodes', '3', 'are', 'other', 'Shark', 'Week', 'so', 'really', 'are', 'fan', 'have', 'others', 'do', 'are', 'buying', 'just', 'Great', 'White', 'Uncaged']",N/A
