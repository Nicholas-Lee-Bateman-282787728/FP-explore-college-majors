They use a video camera to capture anything out of the ordinary.

It feels like you are there watching through the camera.  When the night scenes are over, however, the movie is very boring.The ending provides a really big jump scare and then another quick scare that rounds out the movie pretty well.

1293547,A1YSDK1ZEVMT7U,B002VKE0XA,Aaron M.,"[1, 1]","Another Blair Witch imitator, this time about demonic activity. You'd think this one would have a higher potential creep factor considering its setting is entirely the residence of its characters. There's no need to actually go anywhere to run into the horror, it just comes right into the home.This film reuses many of the same set pieces of Blair Witch, but lacks that film's rich back story, so you get no sense of history. It does have a ham-fisted back story for one of its main characters that ties the activity to her, but it feels forced.The concept is interesting and seems like it could have worked but there are several problems here. For one, the acting is weak, especially from the supporting cast. It feels like these are people who are trying to make a scary movie. There's just not much authenticity coming through the performances.The film is also repetitive and not very imaginative. We get a generic demon. There isn't much here that you could not see on any number of ""true ghost story"" television programs. It's basically the movie version of one of those.The demon does not seem to have much of an agenda either. When dealing with demons or ghosts you are implying an afterlife of some sort and that in itself sort of takes the sting out of death. These types of movies need a more spiritual basis to work right, some higher spiritual battle. There's nothing like that here. Seems like the demon just wants to kill people, like a serial killer with superpowers.If you just want a roller-coaster with a few jumps and maybe some slight chills, this might work out as a one time viewing, if you are particularly susceptible to this kind of material.

The first 45min are a complete and I do emphasize a *complete* waste of time - God honest I nearly fell asleep twice, forcing my head up before I nodded off. It's incredibly dull, and the ""scares"" amount to the kind of things you'll see at your local haunted funhouse, like broken mirrors and bumping sounds.And this is NOT an assault on low-budget filmmaking at all because I in fact enjoy independent films, when and if they're done properly and the filmmaker has talent.However, the filmmaker succeeded in copying nearly every facet of Blair Witch, right down to its conclusion, and relocating it inside of a house (and I did in fact enjoy Blair Witch because the director was talented and went out of his/her way to blur the line between reality/documentary and fiction, which was absent in Paranormal Activity.)This ""film"" amounted to a poor, mediocre, and shameless copy of another film notwithstanding a new setting.

1293551,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,B002VKE0XA,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[2, 4]","Back in 1999, ""Blair Witch"" started a trend which I feel, has started to wear out its welcome. SO many movies now have the hand-held camera and unknown actors to give them a ""real"" feel, and where using people who aren't on the A-list is a good idea, this film is just another(!) one of those ""real"" films which try to look convincing, sometimes with limited success.As any movie usually does, it has a somewhat slow start, not a bad thing, slowly building up into something which is a genuinely scary film. It is very well-staged, and several times I forgot it was a work of fiction. In many ways, this film is a retread, but some of the best ever made, were also retreads; you, the viewer, know exactly where it's going, but how it gets there, is where the enjoyment of this movie comes in. There are some surprises along the way.The featured couple are subjected to some visits, if you will, from some unseen presence from another realm; it isn't human (enthusiasts of this type of thing say some spirits are human, others aren't), and it doesn't want to just say ""hello."" It has pain, fear, and death on its mind.One area where this film works so well, is the absence of over-the-top special effects, and the ones used are used sparingly. If you were to have a problem of this type in your own house, this is how it probably play out. You don't need a Steven Spielberg budget to made a good scary movie. And this movie is good. And scary. Nightly visits from something you can't see, when this thing doesn't have your best interest at heart, will, in time, send you over the edge. Like ""Blair Witch,"" a major part of this story, is the breakdown of the people who are dealing with this. Psychological thrillers often hit their mark with far more accuracy than some splatter-fest; where the latter isn't without merit, in terms of craftsmanship, these kind of movies aren't particularly scary. They're just gross.***Spoiler part***The thing which cost this otherwise good film a star, was the ending. All the way through, it has a realism to it, which makes the slow-moving story interesting, but the use of a computer-generated visual effect in the last scene, to jump out and yell ""BOO!"" at the viewer, is the self-administered shot to the foot mentioned in this review's title. It is an anti-climax, given the standard it set for itself early on. In the features section, an alternate ending is included, which I feel (a personal opinion, mind you), was far more effective, and convincing than the ""official"" ending. It was a poor decision to edit it as they did.But in all, this is a very good psychological thriller.",4,"Not bad, but it shot itself in the foot...

1293554,A2NHOMBKYV5HOG,B002VKE0XA,Alex Faber,"[2, 5]","THE MOVIE:  While I hated this when I saw it in the theater, oddly enough I found myself thinking about it a lot afterward, and now that I've re-watched it on DVD I've developed a kinder, gentler attitude towards the movie and even have a great regard for it now.  Sure, the characters are underdeveloped and at times irritating, and the narrative is languid, but the authenticity of the story is strong and convincing and the relaxed pace is mesmerizing, and allows the steadily escalating threat to creep up on you and throttle you when it needs to.  Overall, I'd say this is a worthy successor to ""The Blair Witch Project.""THE DVD:  When played, the DVD goes right to a minimalist DVD menu with options to play the movie with the theatrical ending or a single alternate ending, so, to help keep the verisimilitude of the film intact, we're spared having to sit through a parade of movie trailers.  On the downside, I've heard that there were a number of alternate endings made, one of which I managed to catch online, so we may be hit with a double-dip that includes all of these somewhere down the line.  Apart from the alternate ending, the only other feature on the disc is a trailer for Dicaprio's new flick, ""Shutter Island.""Fulfilling its promise to recognize the fans, Paramount has included a list of people who submitted their names to be included on the DVD, and the list can be accessed only after going through the movie itself.  The list runs for 15 minutes and seems to include thousands of names, so if you're looking for yours, have your Pause and Forward Frame buttons ready.THE PACKAGING:  Lame.  The outer artwork for the DVD is decent, but the DVD itself looks like it has rental copy artwork, being coated in plain gray paint/ink with plain text.  As usual, there's no chapter insert, and as is becoming more and more usual, the plastic DVD case is an Eco Box, which means it has sections cut out on both sides of the inside.  So, be prepared to have another DVD case to replace this with.FINAL VERDICT:  If you saw this in theaters and were disappointed, you might want to give it another chance and see if it grows on you.  Perhaps the biggest fault of this movie was the massive marketing machine behind it, which built up expectations for some people that it just couldn't reach.  The DVD treatment could be better, but it is surprisingly pretty good:  the menus look good, there's an alternate ending, and the list of fans is here.

The rest of the movie really just relied on startling the audience. Any movie where a viewer is expecting something profound to happen is waiting for those creepy scary moments when the popcorn goes flying. Just startling an audience doesn't make a good movie.

I never saw it in theaters and took in all the reviews and opinions over the past few months. I love horror movies, so I knew I would see it at some point, but I was careful not to believe all the hype, and took a more ""wait and see"" kind of approach. I just got the blu-ray version of this film for Christmas and watched it a little while ago, my first horror movie for the new year. Honestly, it was thoroughly entertaining and creepy throughout the movie, the best and scariest part being the last few minutes of the film. I also watched the alternate ending. I guess if I had to decide which ending I liked better, I would have to go with the theatrical version, but the alternate was very eerie as well. I do not feel as those who find themselves unable to sleep for weeks after seeing this film, but I can see myself looking over my shoulder at times. I am 51 years old, and have loved horror films since I was a young boy. But, putting it in perspective, I remember freaking out watching an episode the Twilight Zone back in the 60s and being unable to sleep that night. I think the younger crowd, for the most part, would be most frightened by ""Paranormal Activity"" and us older folks are more frightened by day-to-day events in the world than by a movie. Suffice it to say, I thought it was worth watching and should give you a few jolts, probably many more jolts if you are younger. Some people told me it was boring, which I did not find. It kept my attention from start to finish. The blu-ray transfer seemed fine, given the way it was filmed. I have no complaints in that department.

An essentially point-of-view film throughout, it does a great job of slowly unfolding the story from both the actors' perspective, as well as their subconscious' perspective. We get to observe them by day, then by night, both while they're awake and asleep.  A few observations.  First, although its ultra low budget, it doesn't really feel that way.  The purposeful focusing of handheld/tripod camera on the actors relegates the low budget aspects to inconsequential impact.  Second, the acting was surprisingly good.  As the movie progresses, the characters undergo progressively worse paranormal activity, and they do a good job of realistically portraying someone subjected to that type of stress.  Third, the film's crescendo worked well; gradually, the paranormal activities increase in frequency and severity, and culminate quite dramatically.  Although the film progresses in a day-by-day format with the film split between the day and night activities (which, in turn, can lend to precarious predictability), it is pulled off well.  Yes, the film often focuses on the things that happen to the couple while in bed, but their experiences vary enough that each scene is still highly effective.  Fourth, the movie did an outstanding job of scaring me.  Being ultra low budget, they were forced to make good use of low tech approaches for creating mood, and they did an outstanding job of that.  I constantly found myself asking what is going to happen next.  Although the result was often predictable, the mood set and built made for lots of good jumps.  Lastly, my only complaint is some of the unrealism.  For example (SPOILER), the couple refuse to leave the house in light of someone's admonition that the spirit will follow them anywhere.  If i were experiencing the types of things they did, I'd at least want to be somewhere with lots of people.  This, and a few other non sequiturs did lend a bit of incredulity, but any good fan of horror should be able to accept these and enjoy the scares.

PA succeeds on the second aspect but doesn't do a lot on the first one.There are things that are cool about this movie, although it's debatable whether its the most scariest movie of all times.Good-1. In a low budget and simple setup, the director manages to make a good horror flick enough to chill your bones. The effective use of single camera is a worth try and it succeeds too.2. No use of stupid masks, effects, blood, murders, dead bodies whatsoever. That's a relief. This movie purely relies on your imagination and just the feel that ""something is gonna happen"". Wonderful!3. Excellent use of realistic sounds rather than using unnecessary bangs/howls/screams or unnecessary sudden loud noises to make you jump from the seat.In short, a nice blend of nearly realistic horror. It's effective in its own ways. However, i thought it was more of hype than the material itself (as another reviewer has stated as his review title).I think the biggest success of the movie lies in its after effects. THIS ONE IS BOUND TO BRING YOU SLEEPLESS NIGHTS. The fact that it has been shot as a home video and in a typical US house, it makes the movie so much true-to-life that you see your own house reflected in it, and thats what will scare you the most.Bad-1. Stupid character development. At one point (actually at several points) the guy annoys me. How can one be so stupid and one-directional even when you notice things going in the wrong way all the time? Plus, that idiot remains adamant throughout the movie and drops it exactly when he shouldn't? I couldn't gulp it.2. How can the ""helper"" (trying to avoid the details) simply walk away when he is actually supposed to do something? If he wasn't meant to help, why he is there in the plot at the first place?Altogether, this movie surely succeeds as a good horror movie because it's different. I guess if you really looking forward to get scared,  watch it without listening to the excessive hype about this flick. Then it will serve the purpose. This may not live up to the expectations that the media publicity may arise.UPDATE- Recently watched PA2. Now PA1 makes a lot of sense.

1293574,AAX387K7441BL,B002VKE0XA,AvidReader,"[1, 2]","Based on some of the reviews I've read people either loved or hated this movie. I fall into the former group because I found it genuinely scary and unsettling - despite the fact that my sister had already recounted the entire plot to me in detail. The true test of a horror movie is if it leaves you jumping as you try to get to sleep that night, convinced that you heard SOMETHING outside. Well this film definitely passed that test for me.The hand-held camera work took a while to get used to, but once I adjusted to it the film really dragged me in (no pun intended - if you've seen the film you'll get this rather lame attempt at humour). I really love subtle films that take the time to build suspense and don't bombard you with special effects. What made this film so successful though was the realistic dialogue and excellent acting. I found it very easy to believe that this was a real-life couple and that I was watching a homemade recording of their lives. When the paranormal events start to happen with increasing frequency they are genuinely creepy. One reviewer made the point that: ""When you're watching time-lapse film of two people asleep in a dark room, it's surprising how little it takes to scare you"". I think this is because the film reminds people of just how vulnerable they are when they are sleeping and taps into the primordial fear we all have of what lurks in the darkness. The image that stands out the most in my mind is of Katie standing next to the bed in a zombie-like state staring at Micah as the camera ticks over for hours, and he sleeps on obliviously.Just as all horror films have deeper meanings, I believe this one is about the dynamics of the couple's intimate relationship, and this is supported by the fact that much of the film footage is of them in bed together. Katie's ""demon"" symbolizes her inner frustration and anger with Mica, who is an arrogant fool in so many ways. Despite the fact that she has been experiencing paranormal events all her life, he refuses to listen to anything she says and carries on antagonizing the demon even when things begin to get very freaky. He refuses to let Katie consult an expert, brings an ouiji board into the house despite being told it will invite the demon in and goads the demon to give them more evidence of its existence. Katie tells him repeatedly that they need to ignore it and get on with their lives, but he continues to follow her everywhere with the camera, causing her even more anguish and distress. Is it just a coincidence that at the end of the film she hurtles his body directly at the camera?Despite the fact that they are clearly dealing with something paranormal Micah continues to search through the house, thinking that he is going to find it, showing that he is incapable of helping Katie because he can't open his mind and accept that there are some things he can't understand or control. The fact that this is tied up with his masculine pride is made obvious when he says that he won't admit defeat or seek help because no demon is going to come into his home and mess with his woman. It is revealing that when in a zombie-like state one night Katie leaves the house and Micah finds her hours later sitting out on the verandah in the freezing cold. The house symbolizes their relationship and by leaving it Katie is acting out her desire for escape. When Micca tries to get her to come back inside she initially refuses.According to my interpretation this film can be read as a comment on the limitations of the modern male (LOL), and Katie's demon represents the murderous urges that lurk inside all women who have to put up with him. To be fair it's not just men who can be incredibly annoying to live with, so I guess you could say it's about the repressed anger and frustration that everyone experiences to some degree in intimate relationships. Films like this terrify us by giving us a glimpse of the demons that lurk in our own subconscious and only come out at night in our dreams, while also providing some catharsis. (I found it quite amusing that the film was shot in the director's own house and that his ""girlfriend at the time"" found it hard to deal with the 24 hour film set - their relationship obviously didn't survive",4,Creepy,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,4250,"['Based', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'people', 'loved', 'hated', 'movie', 'fall', 'former', 'group', 'found', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'unsettling', 'fact', 'sister', 'had', 'already', 'recounted', 'entire', 'plot', 'detail', 'true', 'test', 'horror', 'movie', 'jumping', 'try', 'get', 'sleep', 'night', 'convinced', 'heard', 'SOMETHING', 'outside', 'Well', 'film', 'definitely', 'passed', 'test', 'me.The', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'work', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'used', 'once', 'adjusted', 'film', 'really', 'dragged', 'pun', 'intended', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', ""'ll"", 'get', 'rather', 'lame', 'attempt', 'humour', 'really', 'love', 'subtle', 'films', 'take', 'time', 'build', 'suspense', 'do', ""n't"", 'bombard', 'special', 'effects', 'What', 'made', 'film', 'so', 'successful', 'though', 'was', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'excellent', 'acting', 'found', 'very', 'easy', 'believe', 'was', 'real-life', 'couple', 'was', 'watching', 'homemade', 'recording', 'lives', 'When', 'paranormal', 'events', 'start', 'happen', 'increasing', 'frequency', 'are', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'One', 'reviewer', 'made', 'point', 'When', ""'re"", 'watching', 'time-lapse', 'film', 'two', 'people', 'asleep', 'dark', 'room', 'surprising', 'how', 'little', 'scare', 'think', 'film', 'people', 'just', 'how', 'vulnerable', 'are', 'when', 'are', 'sleeping', 'taps', 'primordial', 'fear', 'have', 'what', 'darkness', 'image', 'out', 'most', 'mind', 'Katie', 'standing', 'next', 'bed', 'zombie-like', 'state', 'staring', 'Micah', 'camera', 'over', 'hours', 'obliviously.Just', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'deeper', 'meanings', 'believe', 'one', 'dynamics', 'couple', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'supported', 'fact', 'much', 'film', 'footage', 'bed', 'together', 'Katie', 'demon', 'inner', 'frustration', 'anger', 'Mica', 'who', 'arrogant', 'fool', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'fact', 'been', 'experiencing', 'paranormal', 'events', 'life', 'listen', 'anything', 'antagonizing', 'demon', 'even', 'when', 'things', 'begin', 'get', 'very', 'freaky', 'let', 'Katie', 'consult', 'expert', 'ouiji', 'board', 'house', 'being', 'told', 'will', 'invite', 'demon', 'goads', 'demon', 'give', 'more', 'evidence', 'existence', 'Katie', 'repeatedly', 'need', 'ignore', 'get', 'lives', 'follow', 'everywhere', 'camera', 'causing', 'even', 'more', 'anguish', 'distress', 'just', 'coincidence', 'end', 'film', 'body', 'directly', 'camera', 'fact', 'are', 'clearly', 'dealing', 'something', 'paranormal', 'Micah', 'search', 'house', 'thinking', 'going', 'find', 'showing', 'incapable', 'helping', 'Katie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'open', 'mind', 'accept', 'are', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'control', 'fact', 'tied', 'up', 'masculine', 'pride', 'made', 'obvious', 'when', 'wo', ""n't"", 'admit', 'defeat', 'seek', 'help', 'demon', 'going', 'come', 'home', 'mess', 'woman', 'revealing', 'when', 'zombie-like', 'state', 'one', 'night', 'Katie', 'house', 'Micah', 'hours', 'later', 'sitting', 'out', 'verandah', 'freezing', 'cold', 'house', 'relationship', 'leaving', 'Katie', 'acting', 'out', 'desire', 'escape', 'When', 'Micca', 'get', 'come', 'back', 'initially', 'refuses.According', 'interpretation', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'comment', 'limitations', 'modern', 'male', 'LOL', 'Katie', 'demon', 'murderous', 'urges', 'lurk', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'be', 'fair', 'not', 'just', 'men', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'live', 'guess', 'could', 'say', 'repressed', 'anger', 'frustration', 'everyone', 'experiences', 'degree', 'intimate', 'relationships', 'Films', 'terrify', 'giving', 'glimpse', 'demons', 'lurk', 'own', 'subconscious', 'only', 'come', 'out', 'night', 'dreams', 'also', 'providing', 'catharsis', 'found', 'quite', 'amusing', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'director', 'own', 'house', 'girlfriend', 'time', 'found', 'hard', 'deal', '24', 'hour', 'film', 'set', 'relationship', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'survive']",N/A

To me, it is right up there with the Exorcist. And that is scary. I am a huge horror movie freak. None of them make me scared, but this made me pretty jumpy and shaky at the end of the film. I even had nightmares! Some people say it is slow moving. The second one was slow moving. Not this one. Like a normal horror movie, things were mild at the beginning. Door moving and some thudding noises but as each night went by, things got extreme after the boyfriend got the ouija board things started getting worse. Door slamming shut suddenly, the hall light would turn on for a few minutes then turn off. Un human demonic footprints appear in the powder they leave down one night. At some point a huge noise was heard from downtstairs and at that scene if you REALLY listen carefully, you can hear this slight distant groaning sound that sounds like Regan from The Exorcist. Then it got to the point when the girl was possessed by the demon. The ending was most likely the most scariest part. The girl (Katie). Katie stabbed herself with a small black cross. The boyfriend planned on them leaving but Katie refused saying it will be ok. By night, Katie gets up and stares at her boyfriend as he sleeps for 2 hours. Then she goes down stairs. You cannot see what is happening downstairs since it is recorded. But all of a sudden a loud blood curdling scream hit. That scream was so loud that I remember saying ""What the heck is happing?!"" over and over. And he ran down and you could hear a struggle when finally it went dead silent. Like as if you lost volume. Then you heard footsteps and suddenly the boyfriend's body was slammed up against the camera and Katie smiled demonicaly at the camarea and it went to black.I think whoever doesn't get scared by this or thinks it is stupid or fake, is a real dead head.

Much like The Blair Witch Project, this is a movie filmed as if it were based on real events and shot with little production on a shoestring budget. There are only four people ever on screen; the characters are believable and the performances of the two leads, a couple who decide to film the strange ""paranormal activities"" going on in their house, really allow the audience to be sucked into their world.

1293578,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002VKE0XA,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","First of all, Happy New Year everybody!  I got Paranormal Activity for Christmas and watched it shortly after the new year began, late at night.I see this film is one of those ""love it or hate it"" type horror flicks.  Actually according to the majority of reviews here on amazon, most believe it's a terrible attempt at the horror genre.  I couldn't disagree more.Alright, for the first 20 minutes, I was definitely leaning towards ""This is a stinky, overrated hunk of disappointment"" just like the Blair Witch Project.  This is because we see nothing but a man and his girlfriend/wife walking around through their home doing ordinary things that all couples do.  However as the storyline got underway, I began to see what makes Paranormal Activity such a rewarding experience.Let me state exactly what I think this movie does brilliantly- I've watched countless ghost documentaries in my time (just like I'm sure many of you have) and I believe Paranormal Activity is one of the very few that accurately illustrates exactly what the claims describe in those documentaries.  In other words, this is EXACTLY what a horror movie should be like- it captures the atmosphere and suspense of a real story.  Not that THIS particular story is based on true events mind you- but it sure reminds me of several stories I've heard from those documentaries.Now, we can argue that many of those ghost documentaries could very well we totally fictitious or far-fetched, however let's say most of them are true, and that most ghost stories we watch on television ARE based on factual evidence.  With THAT in mind -and the frightening thoughts that run through my mind while watching any given ghost documentary- Paranormal Activity delivers exactly how I'd want it to.A HUGE difference between the Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity is that nothing EVER happens in the Blair Witch Project.  It's just a bunch of young kids walking through the woods with a home video camera recording a dreary and typical walk through such areas.With Paranormal Activity, there's REAL suspense that actually leads to something meaningful.  You'll know when such suspense arrives whenever the characters (a man and his girlfriend or wife) go to sleep and have a video camera set up in the corner of their bedroom to record the entire nights worth of events.  The next day the man reviews the footage.Gradually, with each night that passes, the activity gets stronger and stronger, until... you'll be gasping in anticipation wondering what's going to happen next because it just gets REALLY crazy.  I'm not scared easily, but when a film sets out to replicate the kind of stories we've been hearing for years from all those ghost documentaries, yeah, this is pretty original stuff as far as horror storytelling is concerned, so I thoroughly enjoy Paranormal Activity.The only thing that bugged me is that the film took place in San Diego.  I love San Diego, I have family there, the people I've communicated with have been super polite out there but... I just think a setting on the east coast given the high amounts of ghost activity reported over the years would have been a better location.I highly recommend it.  Just don't judge the movie by the first 20 minutes which is a pretty boring amount of nothingness.  Keep watching and you'll see what makes the film so frightening.",5,loved it,1325376000,"01 1, 2012",2012,3355,"['First', 'Happy', 'New', 'Year', 'everybody', 'got', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Christmas', 'watched', 'shortly', 'new', 'year', 'began', 'late', 'night.I', 'see', 'film', 'one', 'love', 'hate', 'type', 'horror', 'flicks', 'Actually', 'according', 'majority', 'reviews', 'here', 'amazon', 'most', 'believe', 'terrible', 'attempt', 'horror', 'genre', 'could', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'more.Alright', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'was', 'definitely', 'leaning', 'towards', 'stinky', 'overrated', 'hunk', 'disappointment', 'just', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'see', 'nothing', 'man', 'girlfriend/wife', 'walking', 'around', 'home', 'doing', 'ordinary', 'things', 'couples', 'do', 'However', 'storyline', 'got', 'underway', 'began', 'see', 'what', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'rewarding', 'experience.Let', 'state', 'exactly', 'what', 'think', 'movie', 'brilliantly-', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'countless', 'ghost', 'documentaries', 'time', 'just', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'have', 'believe', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'accurately', 'exactly', 'what', 'claims', 'describe', 'documentaries', 'other', 'words', 'EXACTLY', 'what', 'horror', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'like-', 'atmosphere', 'suspense', 'real', 'story', 'Not', 'THIS', 'particular', 'story', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'you-', 'sure', 'several', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'documentaries.Now', 'can', 'argue', 'many', 'ghost', 'documentaries', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'totally', 'fictitious', 'far-fetched', 'however', 'let', 'say', 'most', 'are', 'true', 'most', 'ghost', 'stories', 'watch', 'television', 'ARE', 'based', 'factual', 'evidence', 'mind', '-and', 'frightening', 'thoughts', 'run', 'mind', 'watching', 'given', 'ghost', 'documentary-', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'exactly', 'how', ""'d"", 'want', 'to.A', 'HUGE', 'difference', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'nothing', 'EVER', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'just', 'bunch', 'young', 'kids', 'walking', 'woods', 'home', 'video', 'camera', 'recording', 'dreary', 'typical', 'walk', 'such', 'areas.With', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'REAL', 'suspense', 'actually', 'something', 'meaningful', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'such', 'suspense', 'whenever', 'characters', 'man', 'girlfriend', 'wife', 'go', 'sleep', 'have', 'video', 'camera', 'set', 'up', 'corner', 'bedroom', 'record', 'entire', 'nights', 'worth', 'events', 'next', 'day', 'man', 'footage.Gradually', 'night', 'activity', 'stronger', 'stronger', ""'ll"", 'be', 'gasping', 'anticipation', 'wondering', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'just', 'REALLY', 'crazy', ""'m"", 'not', 'scared', 'easily', 'when', 'film', 'out', 'replicate', 'kind', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hearing', 'years', 'ghost', 'documentaries', 'yeah', 'pretty', 'original', 'stuff', 'as', 'far', 'horror', 'storytelling', 'concerned', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'Paranormal', 'Activity.The', 'only', 'thing', 'bugged', 'film', 'took', 'place', 'San', 'Diego', 'love', 'San', 'Diego', 'have', 'family', 'there', 'people', ""'ve"", 'communicated', 'have', 'been', 'super', 'polite', 'there', 'just', 'think', 'setting', 'east', 'coast', 'given', 'high', 'amounts', 'ghost', 'activity', 'reported', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'location.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'movie', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'pretty', 'boring', 'amount', 'nothingness', 'Keep', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'frightening']",N/A

Most horror films are garbage and rely on things jumping out at you or gore to scare you.  It's that lack of imagination that makes the horror film genre, these days, super boring. All you see is the same old plots recycled over and over again.  This movie is different.  It is scary without being startling.  It's the things you don't see that are most terrifying.  I thought the ending was particularly well done and very creepy.  The story revolves around a young woman and her boyfriend who live in a nice house.  The girl has had a history of seeing strange ""paranormal"" things happen to her since she was a child.  You find out that some sort of ""entity"" has been following her from house to house.  Her skeptical boyfriend decides to set up a camera in their room to record any strange happenings in their house.  The film, like the Blair Witch Project, is shown from the first person camera point of view.The film is by no means perfect though. One of the problems I had with the film was the total stupidity of the characters.  They do things that no normal person would do in that situation.  When faced with an evil entity that clearly wants to harm them, what do they do?  They keep on filming and take their sweet time getting help.  The male character, Micah, is particularly idiotic in the fact that he tries to fix the situation himself.  He never seems to take things very seriously even while reviewing the tapes that show some horrifying things happening.  He hears inhuman growling on voice recordings and never seems too worried about it.  Any normal person would be freaked out beyond belief.

Alfred Hitchcock helped bring this term to fruition by keeping the forces of evil hidden from us, but obviously with us, near us, and trying desperately to get in.First time writer/director and renaissance film-make Oren Peli took the ""less is more"" to heart and decided to do his own version of aBlair Witch Project, but with much greater success in my book.I am not an easily spooked guy. And I've seen my share of horror films that did absolutely nothing for me. Although some of them I still love, they didn't give me goosebumps. One of my favorites,Invasion of the Body Snatchers(1956), was creepy and it made me think, but it never made me jump in my seat. The same could not be said for PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. It is, without a doubt, a true minimalist horror film that strikes at the heart of our pysche. And when I say ""minimalist"", I mean minimal. Made for roughly $15,000, it's first week out in theaters it grossed over $9 million. I can't even imagine how many tens-of-millions its made now that its out on DVD. Peli took the minimalist approach on time, too, as the entire film runs only 86 minutes. And they filmed it all in ten days. And in Peli's own house!The best thing about the film is that it gradually builds tension, never letting us in on what it is that's stalking Katie. This unknown is frustratingly freakish, and we can really feel the stress Katie and her boyfriend Micah are under as they lose sleep, hear doors slam, see footprints appear out of nowhere, and helplessly watch as more and more ""things"" begin happening to them.Those who hate the handheld camera movements of The Blair Witch Project andCloverfield, will want to avoid this one, as it, too, uses a handheld.

More importantly, this film shows that you can make a solid 3-4 star movie with almost no money, as long as you have a competent script and competent actors.  Both of those factors are present here.  The script isn't brilliant, but it makes sense, and doesn't have any glaring holes.  The bare-bones cast (who, according to one source, was found via a Craigslist ad and paid $500 each) were competent actors who fit the material.  Hollywood polish and glam wouldn't have fit into this movie anyway.  Finally, the production design took the limitations of the budget and crew (for example, lots of static camera) and made them into integral parts of the movie.  I wish that Hollywood would finally learn that thinking and advance planning make a better movie that tons of money and fixing things in post.This isn't brilliant; it's not gory; and it's not the best thing you'll ever see.  What ""Paranormal Activity"" is is a solid movie that will unsettle you a little, capture your attention, and entertain you for 90 minutes in a better way than a lot of other things you'll see this year.

But I do enjoy the film, and I think it deserves praise.Yep, I give it five stars.  I was lucky to see this film when it fell into demand and was shown ""selectively"" at a free screening in Chicago.  My buddy went with me; a horror film aficionado and in the MFA program with me at Columbia.  We sat down, not sure what to expect, except it probably used the same formula as BWP did ten years ago.  (BWP is one of only three films that I saw at least three times in the theatre)  Same formula, so what!  This movie, though predictable most of the time, really kept me on edge and anticipating each night of activity.It has a very simple A to B sort of timeline, each night escalates in activity.  Things get weirder and more ""clues"" arise as to the cause/reason/source of the activity, etc.  Though my friend almost never jumps or covers his face during scary movies, he and I were on edge the entire show.  To quote him, ""I am never that scared.  What you saw is rare, I haven't been scared like that since I saw Blair Witch"".  And it's true, it does have definite ties to BWP, and in a sense it is the exact same film, con temporized to the current decade.Go into it with an open mind, hoping and expecting to get scared.  It's unnecessary to question and point out the validity, likeliness, and theoretical elements of the story.  Of course its unrealistic and a rather silly premise to begin with.  Ouija boards, demonologists, EVPs and video footage.  All of that!  But what horror films aren't cheesy?  You should go into it expecting to enjoy a good fright.I found that I was often jumping and indeed covering my face in anticipation of what scares might come next.  Get over the ""hype"" of the film and don't prepare to be judgmental before you've even seen it.  Honestly, I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did in the theatre.  Viewing it a second time at home, it still had the same lasting effect on me as it did the first time I saw it.It's safe to say if you enjoyed BWP then this film you will also enjoy.

1293591,A3PERVDBNCQJQV,B002VKE0XA,"Brian R Yandle ""Brian R Yandle""","[5, 9]","**Cracking knuckles**The scariest, most terrifying experience you could possibly have in the theaters?? Hmm, I digress.I seem to remember writing a review for Cloverfield back in 2008. Oh wait, I also wrote a column for that Blair Witch Project travesty also in 1999. Needless to say this handheld camera film gimmick doesn't seem to be getting any better nor do I appreciate them anymore after 10 & a half years. I am steering clear from anymore of these ""scariest movie of all time"" claims from here on out.Sadly, we have here another disappointing case of independent horror which seemed destined for instant cult or sleeper status. While the movie-going audiences are still in some sort of whirlwind of conflicting ideas about what horror should be & whether or not they actually like horror films, this is the saddened result of a cinematic suppository which fails to satisfy on any great level. These boring, overlong films aren't entertaining nor do they even provide a sense of instant gratification & I deeply regret having voted for this movie by investing a single hard-earned dollar at the local multiplex. Unfortunately,I can't get my one dollar back & I've lost 82 minutes of life that cannot be returned.Katie & Micah are a young suburban couple who desperately try to battle a supernatural presence in their home while making sense of the footage captured through modern technology. Katie feels that she has terrorized by some entity since the young age of 8 & wants to be free of this evil force which somehow manages to follow her wherever she goes. Micah, on the other hand, feels he can abolish it with his overly Mano-Mano pride & doesn't wish to involve any third parties at his girlfriend's insistence. Katie does hire a psychic who convinces her throughout the film that forces are wreaking havoc within the home although the couple continues to merely record the activity & makes no attempt to evacuate the premises.While only 82 minutes, only about 14-15 of that is spent with any paranormal activity & the rest is spent with two amateur actors who pretend to be a couple haunted by some demonic presence. I've seen better acting in a local bar by two drunkards doing their best on karaoke night. As far as the paranormal activity goes, there are no real scares to speak of. Who hasn't heard footsteps or things that go bump in the night? In fact, there are doors at my current place of employment that open all throughout the night but I don't jump at the sound of them nor do I suspect any evil forces at play.  Without the proper atmosphere & lighting, you can't possibly expect any chills or thrills from something as flat as Paranormal Activity.If annoying dialog & slow pacing without any real atmosphere to speak of weren't bad enough, why do always find these nimrods in every handheld camera-film trying to capture every last semi-traumatic experience. If you were in a haunted house of sorts & you felt that you're friends were in some sort of eminent danger, wouldn't you drop that goddamn camera & try to assist your friends in their time of peril? Perhaps it's just me & my opinion only but this is yet one more strike against the film for being unbelievable & downright hokey. While no one really needs to shred Paranormal Activity for being unrealistic, it should be blatantly obvious in my book.Although I'm sure there will be many who will feel I've been too harsh with one of the most talked about films of 2009, I find it somewhat puzzling that so many have offered the undeserved four star rating. Somehow this film is anything but refreshing although the box office is usually flooded with unnecessary horror remakes & films catering to the Harry Potter/ Twilight fan base. Sheesh, and people are trashing Rob Zombie's films??

To sum it up in one word before I relive the horror. This was terrifying. Not in the jumpy or gory horror movie way that you may be used to, but in the creepy suspense filled way. Although it was filled with clich&eacute; moments and towards the end became a bit too over the top, it was still a film that managed to encapsulate the pure horror of what you were witnessing and retain it throughout.This is a ""lost footage"" movie which is one that seems to be a genre that is developing quite a trend in recent years. This tells the story of Micah and his girlfriend Katie, a couple ""engaged to be engaged"". Katie has mentioned that she has been haunted by a presence all her life and since she has moved in with Micah he has been determined to capture this ""Paranormal Activity"" on tape. The couple, after catching a few strange things, bring in a psychic who warns them that this isn't a ghost but a demon which shouldn't be messed with or things will get worse.Micah is determined not to let this thing beat them or be around forever so he decides that he's going to challenge the demon to communicate with them so he can give it what it wants in the hope that it will go away (see the clich&eacute;?) Micah brings a Ouija board into the house in an attempt to communicate with it, but Katie, being terrified of playing with this type of thing is furious.I'll leave it there as I fear I've given away too much as it is. The film is entirely from the one video camera perspective and over time the events get weirder and weirder gradually building the suspense to what you know will be a culmination of challenging this spirit or demon. The acting is sublime, it really is. From the girl playing Katie that is, the guy playing Micah is an interchangeable character that could be played just as well by anyone.The pacing of the film is near perfect. A previous review said that the pace was too slow, well I think this person was missing the whole point. It was slow and remained slow throughout as it is not an action/horror movie, it's a suspense/horror shot from the perspective of a couple experiencing this as it happens. It retained no devices to set the mood or anything like that, it allowed you to witness these events and fear for the safety of those living in the house. The couple did look like a couple and I found myself being scared for them and their experience which is an achievement.A golden film that knocks all the new horror movies out the water and presents something fresh and new.

The use of silence and waiting for something to happen is one of the main ways this film builds this suspense. It Starts out slow with subtle signs of a demon presence and develops more fear and horror with the demon haunting becoming more violent and more occurent. The idea of having the thing right in the room with you without you knowing exploits the human fear of being watched.

By including lengthy segments that are relatively uneventful, director Oren Peli creates a believable scenario that could conceivably happen to anyone. When the events do occur, they are so jarring and incredibly frightening that they are sure to shock even the hardened Horror fan without ever having to show anything on screen. Micah Sloat creates a rounded character that is able to sneak in a few laughs to break up the tension, however Katie's performance often becomes too scripted and unnatural to be taken seriously. The insignificant touches that are added to the house (such as the patches of dead grass in the yard or bead table that Katie works from) add an authenticity to the characters and setting. Peli's adaptation of the documentary-style format in to the ghost film proves to be a winning combination that offers some of the greatest scares in recent decades. The phenomenal box office response served to solidify this fact, making PARANORMAL ACTIVITY one of the most successful Independent films of all time.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,Paranormal Activity,1275868800,"06 7, 2010",2010,1582,"['couple', 'filming', 'unexplained', 'activities', 'have', 'been', 'haunting', 'Southern', 'Californian', 'home', 'entity', 'show', 'more', 'more', 'signs', 'presence', 'Micah', 'Katie', 'quickly', 'realize', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'tempted', 'forces', 'do', 'not', 'fully', 'understand', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'one', 'strongest', 'found-footage', 'films', 'genre', 'film', 'integrity', 'implementing', 'slow', 'subtle', 'terror', 'built', 'suspense', 'rather', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'jump', 'scares', 'including', 'lengthy', 'segments', 'are', 'relatively', 'uneventful', 'director', 'Oren', 'Peli', 'believable', 'scenario', 'could', 'conceivably', 'happen', 'anyone', 'When', 'events', 'do', 'occur', 'are', 'so', 'jarring', 'incredibly', 'frightening', 'are', 'sure', 'shock', 'even', 'hardened', 'Horror', 'fan', 'ever', 'having', 'show', 'anything', 'screen', 'Micah', 'Sloat', 'rounded', 'character', 'able', 'sneak', 'few', 'laughs', 'break', 'up', 'tension', 'however', 'Katie', 'performance', 'often', 'too', 'scripted', 'unnatural', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'insignificant', 'touches', 'are', 'added', 'house', 'such', 'patches', 'dead', 'grass', 'yard', 'bead', 'table', 'Katie', 'add', 'authenticity', 'characters', 'setting', 'Peli', 'adaptation', 'documentary-style', 'format', 'ghost', 'film', 'be', 'winning', 'combination', 'greatest', 'scares', 'recent', 'decades', 'phenomenal', 'box', 'office', 'response', 'served', 'solidify', 'fact', 'making', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'Independent', 'films', 'time.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

""Scariest movie evar!!"" they said.  Not really - not even close.  About 10 minutes in I started getting that same nagging feeling in my gut that I had when watching The Blair Witch Project. It was that feeling like ""oh boy I am about to waste some time and walk away utterly disappointed"" - and I was.This movie is not scary at all.  I see a lot of people's number one defense of this movie is ""you need a good imagination"".  I have a great imagination.  Was I wondering if it was the demon Pazuzu moving the sheets or having fun walking through the ingenious ""flour trap"" set by the heroic Micah? Not really. Would a demon have something better do to than follow around a chubby girl her whole life? I'm leaning towards probably.  But let's forget about the whole ""suspension of disbelief"" thing,  the gags themselves are not scary either.  There are things that could have been done, maybe with a tiny bit bigger budget, that would have produced some real chills.  A Ouija board moving by itself and then catching on fire was not one of them.  One of the more effective things in the movie was when the girl got out of bed and stood there for several hours - not exactly breaking the bank with that effect are we? They would have been better off stealing some of the effects from ""Ghost Hunters""(c'mon, you don't believe that show is real, do you?). Well at least they decided to include the paranormal staple of EVPs.  I think I heard the demon say ""I want a hamburger"" but I guess that's left up to interpretation of the garbled nonsense that's usually recorded.Other problems were the acting and pace.  Acting is forgivable and I can look past it - I don't think they could afford Brad Pitt.  The pace of the movie sucked however.  You don't need money to fix the pace you need better writing.  Every ""night"" just left me more disappointed and I kept wondering when the movie was going to get good.  By the time something finally happened on the last night I really didn't care anymore, I was just thankful it was over.If I was going to compare this movie to others in this sub-genre of demons and possession I would put this up against The Exorcist and Evil Dead.

I think that it's awesome! I've seen over 1000 horror movies and Paranormal Activity is definitely one of the best I've seen (top 50)! It's not one of the best I've seen only because it's one of the scariest, it's also one of the most realistic! The mix of realism, suspense and tension is just perfect!A lot of people say that it's boring and I really don't get it. It's WAY too suspenseful to be boring. I've been trying to understand why the people that thought that it was boring went to see it since it was released. Why does someone who get bored easily go see a movie about a couple filming in their house? Why does someone who hated The Blair Witch Movie go see a similar movie? While we're at it, why does someone expect to be scared in a theater full of people? The fact that there are idiotic teens that can't stop talking and laughing 90% of the time doesn't help. Personally, I can't imagine finding a movie scary with 30 persons around me. I thought that the movie was scary (compared to most movies), but I watched it alone in the dark with an headset. The fact that I believe (or want to) in ghosts/demons helped as well. Actually, I can't imagine someone who doesn't believe in ghosts/demons finding a movie about them scary. What makes ghost/demons movies scary is the fact that there's no proof that they don't exist.Anyway, the first few minutes of the movie was the only time that I didn't feel uneasy! The atmosphere was simply creepy! Hell, even a few parts with nothing but the couple talking were creepy! I guess that it was the expectation that something really bad was going to happen. The movie doesn't rely on cheap jump scares and/or scary images and doesn't have any over-the-top scare, it's all about tension and suspense.It's not for people who need action every 5 minute and over-the-top scares. It's not for people who take trailers seriously and go see movies with unrealistically high expectations. It's not for people who watch movies with a closed minded and try NOT to get scared.Finally, if it wasn't hyped, it would be much more appreciated. Some people just HAVE to hate hyped movies. Some others are so naive that they believe the hype.PS: All of the people who call the people who like this movie idiots or sheeps are immature idiots.

As the story unfolds and the occurances start to become more frequent, Katie invites a Doctor of Parapsychology into the home to get some guidance as she is convinced the occurances are supernatural.  We learn during the visit that Katie has had a history of feeling a supernatural being at her side at night that started in her childhood and came and went over the years.  Is it back?  Is this her imagination?  Burglars?  Neighborhood kids?  According to the good doctor, he senses a presence in the house and it doesn't feel human (which would be a ghost).

1293611,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B002VKE0XA,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""","[4, 8]","I love the types of horror films that build up the suspense in a film. I love it when the only things you see & hear are slight shadows or knocking sounds. I liked the first Blair Witch film. So by all accounts, I really should've liked this film. But I didn't. I know that I'm going to get tons of negatives from this review because hey... some people don't like it when others don't share their viewpoints. (And I don't feel like I should have to write a fake review just to get people to agree with me.)And if you are wondering, I generally don't like the films that are all blood & cheap spooks. I also didn't get a lot of the big media hoopla surrounding this film- the majority of what I'd heard about the film came from word of mouth from my friends & acquaintances. So it's not like I'm the type of person who only watches slasher films & it's not like I went into the film expecting this to be the 'Citizen Kane' of horror films.The film follows Katie, a young student who has been followed around by an unseen presence since she was young. Her day trader boyfriend Micah treats her story with amusement & mostly disbelief. He decides to purchase a video camera & record the strange goings on that have started to happen in their ordinary home. As the nights progress, the occurrences become more & more pronounced.I went into this film expecting to be entertained. I liked Blair Witch, so I figured that I'd be able to enjoy this film for the most part. I just didn't like most of the film. Why didn't I like it while so many others obviously did? Who knows? I saw this film with my mother, who describes herself as the most skittish person on earth & even she thought that this film was like watching paint dry on a wall.The first thing that made me a little disinterested is that there's not a whole lot of personality to either Micah or Katie. We see them go about some daily activities, yet there's just not a whole lot of zing to them. I'm not expecting a Michael Bay explosion or for the lead actress to burst into the room wearing something out of a Victoria Secret's catalog, but I do expect slightly more than this. Perhaps that's why I just didn't connect with everything as much- I just really didn't care that overly much about the characters. I know that this was to show that they were normal people & to show their mental deterioration as the events escalated, but I just couldn't really get into either character.The one thing I can say in defense of the film is that towards the end, the film did get better as the paranormal phenomenon got more pronounced & the script started picking up. The ending is pretty interesting, but it just didn't feel like it was worth sitting through the rest of the film for. It certainly wasn't worth the money it would cost to see in the theaters. The camera's shakiness wasn't as bad as it was in the Blair Witch film, but it still was bad enough to give me a pretty bad headache by the film's end.But this is just my opinion. I've talked to a few people who really did enjoy this film & more power to them. I'm glad that they liked it. I just wish that I had. I was just incredibly bored by this film. I'm not saying that people shouldn't watch it, but I do recommend that most wait to see it when it comes out for rental with the alternate endings on it. (I'm assuming that they'll put them on the DVD, anyway.) In the meantime, I recommend some of the older classics out there such as 'The Changeling' & 'The Haunting' (the original one, not the remake). Those are films that build up the suspense slowly & really deliver. This film? I can safely say that I'll probably not rent it when it comes out or watch it again.",2,Tedious & just plain... dull.,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,3683,"['love', 'types', 'horror', 'films', 'build', 'up', 'suspense', 'film', 'love', 'when', 'only', 'things', 'see', 'hear', 'are', 'slight', 'shadows', 'knocking', 'sounds', 'liked', 'first', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'film', 'So', 'accounts', 'really', 'should', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'going', 'get', 'tons', 'negatives', 'review', 'hey', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'viewpoints', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'write', 'fake', 'review', 'just', 'get', 'people', 'agree', 'are', 'wondering', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'films', 'are', 'blood', 'cheap', 'spooks', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'big', 'media', 'hoopla', 'surrounding', 'film-', 'majority', 'what', ""'d"", 'heard', 'film', 'came', 'word', 'mouth', 'friends', 'acquaintances', 'not', ""'m"", 'type', 'person', 'who', 'only', 'slasher', 'films', 'not', 'went', 'film', 'expecting', 'be', ""'Citizen"", 'Kane', 'horror', 'films.The', 'film', 'Katie', 'young', 'student', 'who', 'been', 'followed', 'unseen', 'presence', 'was', 'young', 'day', 'trader', 'boyfriend', 'Micah', 'story', 'amusement', 'mostly', 'disbelief', 'purchase', 'video', 'camera', 'record', 'strange', 'goings', 'have', 'started', 'happen', 'ordinary', 'home', 'nights', 'progress', 'occurrences', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'pronounced.I', 'went', 'film', 'expecting', 'be', 'entertained', 'liked', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'figured', ""'d"", 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'most', 'film', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'so', 'many', 'others', 'obviously', 'did', 'Who', 'saw', 'film', 'mother', 'who', 'most', 'skittish', 'person', 'earth', 'even', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry', 'wall.The', 'first', 'thing', 'made', 'little', 'disinterested', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'personality', 'Micah', 'Katie', 'see', 'go', 'daily', 'activities', 'yet', 'just', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'zing', ""'m"", 'not', 'expecting', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'explosion', 'lead', 'actress', 'burst', 'room', 'wearing', 'something', 'Victoria', 'Secret', 'catalog', 'do', 'expect', 'slightly', 'more', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'connect', 'everything', 'much-', 'just', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'overly', 'much', 'characters', 'know', 'was', 'show', 'were', 'normal', 'people', 'show', 'mental', 'deterioration', 'events', 'escalated', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'character.The', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'defense', 'film', 'end', 'film', 'did', 'get', 'better', 'paranormal', 'phenomenon', 'got', 'more', 'pronounced', 'script', 'started', 'picking', 'up', 'ending', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'worth', 'sitting', 'rest', 'film', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'money', 'would', 'cost', 'see', 'theaters', 'camera', 'shakiness', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'was', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'film', 'still', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'give', 'pretty', 'bad', 'headache', 'film', 'end.But', 'just', 'opinion', ""'ve"", 'talked', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'more', 'power', ""'m"", 'glad', 'liked', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'was', 'just', 'incredibly', 'bored', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'people', 'should', ""n't"", 'watch', 'do', 'recommend', 'most', 'wait', 'see', 'when', 'out', 'rental', 'alternate', 'endings', ""'m"", 'assuming', ""'ll"", 'put', 'DVD', 'anyway', 'meantime', 'recommend', 'older', 'classics', 'there', 'such', ""'The"", 'Changeling', ""'The"", 'Haunting', 'original', 'one', 'not', 'remake', 'are', 'films', 'build', 'up', 'suspense', 'slowly', 'really', 'deliver', 'film', 'can', 'safely', 'say', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'not', 'rent', 'when', 'out', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

This style is what sets it apart, it feels like your watching a documentary about these people's life.It is about Micah and katie who are living in a house. There is obviosly some kind of paranormal activity going on(duh).You watch scenes of thier life, and you really get to kknow these people as you go along. The plot is very well done and keeps the movie going.As you know, the scary things happen in the night. They start out oh so very slow, and slowly get better. Katie becomes really scared and Micah doesn't take it seriously. That's all I'm saying, so I don't spoil anything.Whether it's scary to you or not, differs from person to person. Personally I didn't think it was that scary, but it was a bit scarier than most horror films, because you really feel these characters and thier horrible situation.You never see the paranormal-activity-Maker-ghost-thing.You can fill it in with your imagination or just think of it as an unknown entity. As I said earlier the activity starts REALLY slow. Example, door moving. This is the only real issue, and I was able to get past it. You will have a hard time looking all over your TV, because you don't know where to look to find something moving or out of place. It's a bit unsettling.The only other problem is that it's only 90 min. long, which is short. I think the entity is here because I keep pressing the ""o"" key instead of ""i"".Overall, this isn't the beast horror movie, but it's very immersive and unsetling.

1293613,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002VKE0XA,Chris Pandolfi,"[9, 15]","There's no studio logo when the film begins, and there are no opening credits. There's only a title card thanking the families of Micah Sloat and Katie Featherston for their cooperation. We then go back to the fall of 2006 and see home video footage of Micah prepping the camera just as Katie pulls into the driveway of their San Diego home. Strange things have been going on in the house as they sleep, and they want to capture it on film. A psychic is invited over, and only then do we learn that strange things have been happening to Featherston pretty much her entire life. Is she being followed by some supernatural force? If so, what does it want with her? The psychic makes it clear that his area of expertise is ghosts, which won't do much good for Featherston since it seems she has more of a demon problem.This is the basic scenario of ""Paranormal Activity,"" the most inventive and frightening horror movie of recent memory. Presenting itself as a documentary consisting of raw footage, it works not as a gory, over the top camp fest but as a slow, disturbing unfolding of events. It utilizes unnerving subtleties like phantom scratching noises, mysterious thuds, unexplained shadows, and lights that turn on and off completely on their own. The more overt visual scares come with no explanations for how or why they occur. It's not about what you see, but about what you don't see. Made on a budget of just $15,000, shot in just seven days in a real house without a crew, and released almost entirely through word-of-mouth and internet campaigns, ""Paranormal Activity"" may someday be regarded as one of the scariest movies ever made.Most of the terror is reserved for long, mostly uninterrupted shots of the couple sleeping in their bedroom. At first, we only hear strange noises that don't seem to be coming from anywhere. As the film progresses, stranger, more intense things happen. The door forcefully slams shut, after which we hear loud knocking. Footsteps trail through the bedroom. The bed sheets lift and lower completely on their own. At one point, Featherston awakens, gets out of bed, and just stands there staring at Sloat for the next couple of hours (shown in high speed). When noises wake both of them up, they search the upstairs hallways and discover that the overhead passage to the attic has been opened. What do you think Sloat will find when he goes up to investigate?Wikipedia defines home as ""a place of residence or refuge and comfort."" Unlike films such as ""The Blair Witch Project,"" in which the terror is distantly located in the middle of the woods, ""Paranormal Activity"" takes place in a familiar environment where one is supposed to feel safe and secure from the outside world. The greatest terror is in knowing that your place of residence or refuge and comfort is in fact no such place; rather, it's a place a fear. So many primal fears are exploited in this film--fear of the dark, fear of the unknown, fear of helplessness and isolation, fear of exposure--and yet they're never reduced to the level of cheap thrills. Sitting in the theater, I can't guarantee that you will watch in helpless fascination, as you may keep covering your eyes in anticipation of something dreadful happening. What I can guarantee is that you will be genuinely afraid.That being said, this movie probably wouldn't have worked were it not for Sloat and Featherston (the actors, not the characters they play). Together, they make a convincing young couple. Even more convincing, however, is the way they react separately to the escalating supernatural events. Sloat initially doesn't take anything that happens too seriously, although he does seem enthusiastic about having a camera in the house. Only later, when things go from bad to worse, does he find himself in a power struggle with the entity stalking his girlfriend. There are times when he tries to be the dominant and protective male, claiming that he has the wherewithal to save his girlfriend; in truth, he has never had any control of the situation. Featherton is physically and psychologically more vulnerable, well aware that her past is catching up with her, frustrated at the willfulness and skepticism of her boyfriend. Their believability is a credit to first-time director Oren Peli, who opted not to have them recite scripted lines of dialogue.The film ends exactly the same way it began: Without any credits. The only thing we get is yet another title card, and this time, I won't reveal what it says. I will say that the shot leading up the title card is the most chilling one I've seen since the slow, agonizing close up of Justin Long's head at the end of ""Jeepers Creepers."" I have a feeling that the success of ""Paranormal Activity"" will continue to mount, relying not on studio enforced tactics but on audience reaction, the most authentic promotion there is for a movie. Just as it should be--this is an astonishing achievement, not merely as a story, but as an exercise in pacing, atmosphere, and apprehension. A word of warning: It earns the right to be called a horror movie, so if you don't like being scared, you should definitely stay away.",5,There's Something in the House....,1255046400,"10 9,

No matter where she moves the paranormal activity continues. Now an adult and living with her boyfriend the strange happenings have started up again. As a way to prove or disprove what is happening, her doubting boyfriend buys an expensive camera to set up and record their bedroom at night. The conceit of the movie is that all the footage you see is from their camera. It not only films while they are sleeping, the boyfriend carries it along during the day catching conversations, arguments and a visit from a psychic who tries to help. The phenomena escalates with the boyfriend deliberately provoking whatever is following his girlfriend because he does not believe in it.I enjoyed the way the movie was made as ""found footage"" from the camera the couple used but they didn't do enough with it to make this a truly scary horror film.

I'm glad it wasn't as annoying an experience as watchingThe Ring in the theater. Some people just ruin the whole ""horror at the movies"" experience for me. ANYWAY,I love this movie! It's slow building, and it takes its time building up the tension and sense of atmospheric doom.My favorite types of movies! I love slow horror over gory action-packed horror any day! I know a lot of people gotturned off from this movie because it was very slow and boring, but I thought the ""snail pace"" plot development just madethe grand finale all the more terrifying...I knew something VERY EVIL was about to happen, and when it did, I LITERALLY jumped back in the seat and SCREAMED! Believe the hype of this one. Don't expect a fast paced gory movie that keeps your attention every 5 minutes.Go in and be PATIENT....FORCE YOURSELF through all the boring arguing and bickering and obnoxious behavior from Micah..lol...andyou WILL be REWARDED at the very end. After saying all that...this movie is still not bloody and gory. You have to use your imaginationto truly scare yourself silly. Just like The Blair Witch Project...suspense without the gore. I saw this knowing it was fake, and I still enjoyed it very much! The movie does NOT have to be based on real events to be terrifying. I still love The Blair Witch Project.Paranormal Activity's actors did a wonderful job.[SPOILERS]Micah was so redonkulous. He sure did tick that demon off! By provoking it via name calling, threats, and the Ouija Board. And look what happened to him at the end! He got chewed up and spit back out by the very mad and vengeful demon. Don't provoke demons, people!They can throw (or spit) your pathetic corpse clear across the room! I was actually ready for Micah to get what was coming to him.He was so annoying.In Conclusion, I would definatly recommend Paranormal Activity to anyone who enjoys slow paced horror that focuces on atmospheric moody suspence and dread over blood, gore, and carnage. Slow supernatural horror are my favorite type of horror films, and this one exceeded on all levels. Of course, if you are not patient and get bored easily, you will not enjoy this movie.

1293620,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B002VKE0XA,Craig Whittle,"[21, 27]","PARANORMAL ACTIVITYSTARRING: Katie Featherston, Micah Sloat and Mark FredrichsWRITTEN BY: Oren PeliDIRECTED BY: Oren PeliRated: RGenre: HorrorRelease Date: 16 October 2009Several movie advertisements have used this line for years and I have never found it to be even remotely true until now; so I'm going to use it: Paranormal Activity is the scariest film since The Exorcist. There, I've finally been able to use it!Now that I have your attention, let me save half of you the three minutes that it will take you to finish reading this review and the roughly 90 it'll save you from actually watching the film. If you hated The Blair Witch Project because you thought it was stupid, then you will inevitably despise this film as well. There. See how nice of a guy I am? Now you can spend those 90 minutes doing something you enjoy.For those of you still reading, I will take it that you appreciated the brilliant and unique style of The Blair Witch Project, as did I. You will most likely love this film as well.The Blair Witch Project clearly inspired this film, as it has others and was a slightly better film. But Paranormal Activity is easily 10 times more frightening.I'm told its entire budget was just 15 thousand dollars and it has already grossed over 100 million dollars at the box office.NO; regardless of what you have heard, the film is not real. Neither was The Blair Witch Project or Quarantine or The Fourth Kind.The film looks and feels real though, and that's why it's so terrifying. We are lead to believe that it is `found footage' by the police and that for whatever reason, they are allowing it to be released in theaters nation-wide.The entire thing is shot with a home video camera, operated completely by the two main characters: Katie and Micah. They're a couple with a little more than a lump in the mattress causing problems in their relationship; a demon to be exact.We learn in the first few minutes that for several nights they have witnessed strange `paranormal activity' occurring while they sleep. Micah buys the video camera and explains this to us as we meet Katie when she pulls up in their driveway. We follow them back into the house and with the exception of a scene in the backyard; we never leave the home again for the remainder of the film.It is soon revealed that Katie has been haunted by this demonic spirit for several years, no matter where she goes. They agree to set up the video camera in their bedroom in hopes of capturing evidence of such said `paranormal activity'.That's when it gets creepy. The camera is positioned in the same place every night and a little time dial lets us know what time it is. Every time you see the camera positioned in the corner of the room like that, you know it's about to get scary. And it does, trust me.At first we just hear noises. Then the door moves all by itself. Then we start to see shadows and that's all I'm going to tell you.This is not one of those movies that you will think is just so-so. You will either love it or you will hate it. You will either find it incredibly horrifying; leaving to your imagination what is causing all of this to happen or you will be completely irritated at how lame it is.I think it is much more fun to leave it up to your imagination what the demon looks like. Yes; I know that it is just a guy downstairs making noise and turning on lights and what have you. But it's freaking scary in the movie! You let your mind believe that it's a demon and that's what makes it so fun.The actors don't seem like actors. They feel like real people being themselves on a reality show. When the events begin to take a toll on them and they become scared, you believe that they are going through this for real. (Not literally; I mean you believe their acting performances. It's a movie people; that's all).The only reason it's not a prefect film, is that just like in any horror movie; the characters do stupid things. Especially Micah.You will want to strangle him by the end of the film. He is constantly being a testosterone-driven moron and challenging the demon; thus making it angrier.Also, why didn't they ever leave the house? It's explained by a paranormal expert that leaving won't help anything but it's very obvious this is only in the movie because they wanted an excuse to be able to continue shooting in the same location.When the paranormal expert won't help them due to the overwhelming evil presence in the house, why couldn't they have called in someone else? I'm sure he wasn't the only one around.Regardless if you get slightly annoyed by this towards the end of the film like I did, they make it up to you in the last 20 minutes or so. Most of the film drags on and I can see how it can be boring. But trust me, if you can make it to the end you will be more than satisfied!It is truly disturbing. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Every time they go to bed and you see the little time dial, it's like listening to the tick tack of a roller coaster climbing to the top of the track; you know that something awful but exciting lies just ahead and you can't help but cringe and your heart is racing.I know the film is fake but I am still amazed at how they were able to pull off some of the events that take place. There are no wires folks; there are no obvious bad computer graphics either. The filmmakers took their 15 grand and spent it very wisely. I'm glad to have given them my money. It was the best 7 bucks I've spent to be scared in a very long time.",5,Paranormal Activity Review,1260921600,"12 16, 2009",2009,5505,"['PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITYSTARRING', 'Katie', 'Featherston',

Girl goes missing while the Guy is found dead along with his tape. The End.That's the story in a nutshell folks. And of course Paramount is trying to pass it off as a true story because it drives up ticket sells. But what we're really left with is just another haunted house story that doesn't break any real ground. All the cliches are here: doors opening and closing on their own, stuff flying off furnitures and walls, the girl levitates, stomping footsteps and heavy breathing coming out of no where. While a lot of people have found this to be scary, I found it pretty boring and tedious. Several times I found myself staring up at the clock and wondering how much longer until we see the inevitable ending where the camera hits the ground and the post script comes up. Not the kind of reaction you'd expect from a movie touted as being ""one of the scariest movies ever made"". Sorry but I beg to differ. The cast of two are likable enough and they do come across as being real people as opposed to two dimensional caricatures you find in all haunted house movies.

1293626,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B002VKE0XA,DanD,"[1, 5]","Ordinary young couple Katie and Micah have been experiencing some interesting phenomena.  Out of a sense of playfulness--for he doesn't really believe in ghosts--Micah buys a video camera and decides to film the events.  Thus, this film.The technique behind PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is one that I have always found intriguing--surely the most interesting way to film a horror movie.  CLOVERFIELD utilized it effectively; QUARANTINE, not so much.  Never saw BLAIR WITCH, though I probably will if I find it for an outrageously low price.  My point is, ACTIVITY looks and feels real, which is far more than most horror movies coming out these days.  Its premise is its strongest suit: no real explanation (in fact, what little explanation there is was extraneous and weighed the film down); no real horrors actually seen, at least until the end (and oh, what a final scene; the very last image is a bit cliched, but the minute or two leading up to it...phenomenal); no overarching goals or ambitions or social commentary.  It's just a simple little horror novel about ordinary people finding themselves in an extraordinary situation.I have the feeling, if you didn't see it in theaters, you missed out.  I know a bunch of people who saw it at the cinema and were thoroughly disturbed; after all, a group of people gets frightened far more than a single person (fear being contagious).  Having watched it alone in my apartment (at night, at least), I was entertained, if not overly frightened.  Nor was I really disturbed, and that is why I gave the film only three stars.  The performances are strong (this doesn't come across as ""acting,"" and it shouldn't), the script is engaging and realistic, and the sound effects are absolutely creepy.  But the film never really lingers.  Sure, the ending is great--in fact, that may have contributed to the enthusiastic response.  PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is a ho-hum movie with a truly great premise and a fantastic ending (even the alternate ending is okay; not as good as the one used, but disturbing nonetheless).  It's worth a viewing to fans of the genre; and, over time, will surely gain a cult status that it probably deserves.",3,"A solid, if not great, haunting film, with a truly interesting premise.",1262476800,"01 3, 2010",2010,2164,"['Ordinary', 'young', 'couple', 'Katie', 'Micah', 'have', 'been', 'experiencing', 'interesting', 'phenomena', 'sense', 'playfulness', ""n't"", 'really', 'believe', 'ghosts', 'Micah', 'video', 'camera', 'decides', 'film', 'events', 'Thus', 'film.The', 'technique', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'one', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'intriguing', 'surely', 'most', 'interesting', 'way', 'film', 'horror', 'movie', 'CLOVERFIELD', 'utilized', 'effectively', 'QUARANTINE', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Never', 'saw', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'probably', 'will', 'find', 'outrageously', 'low', 'price', 'point', 'ACTIVITY', 'feels', 'real', 'far', 'more', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'coming', 'days', 'premise', 'strongest', 'suit', 'real', 'explanation', 'fact', 'what', 'little', 'explanation', 'was', 'extraneous', 'weighed', 'film', 'down', 'real', 'horrors', 'actually', 'seen', 'least', 'end', 'oh', 'what', 'final', 'scene', 'very', 'last', 'image', 'bit', 'cliched', 'minute', 'two', 'leading', 'up', 'phenomenal', 'overarching', 'goals', 'ambitions', 'social', 'commentary', 'just', 'simple', 'little', 'horror', 'novel', 'ordinary', 'people', 'finding', 'extraordinary', 'situation.I', 'have', 'feeling', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'theaters', 'missed', 'out', 'know', 'bunch', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'cinema', 'were', 'thoroughly', 'disturbed', 'group', 'people', 'frightened', 'far', 'more', 'single', 'person', 'fear', 'being', 'contagious', 'Having', 'watched', 'alone', 'apartment', 'night', 'least', 'was', 'entertained', 'not', 'overly', 'frightened', 'was', 'really', 'disturbed', 'why', 'gave', 'film', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'performances', 'are', 'strong', ""n't"", 'come', 'acting', 'should', ""n't"", 'script', 'engaging', 'realistic', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'absolutely', 'creepy', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'lingers', 'Sure', 'ending', 'great', 'fact', 'may', 'have', 'contributed', 'enthusiastic', 'response', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'ho-hum', 'movie', 'truly', 'great', 'premise', 'fantastic', 'ending', 'even', 'alternate', 'ending', 'okay', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'used', 'disturbing', 'nonetheless', 'viewing', 'fans', 'genre', 'time', 'will', 'surely', 'gain', 'cult', 'status', 'probably']",N/A

Sadly I would attribute this to years of scary movies showing you what you should be scared of rather than allowing us to see just enough to let the mind fill in the blanks. Many people today have a hard time using their imagination when going to the movies because they are so use to movies filling in all the visual blanks for them. While I would agree to an extent with the ""boredom"" and lack of scariness during the first 15-20 min. (keys dropping, lamps shaking, pounding on walls...stuff like that) it did eventually pick up.

1293628,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B002VKE0XA,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 2]","Count me among those who consider Paranormal Activity a brilliant scary movie.  I can understand some people not liking the movie, but I don't see how anyone can get off saying there's no suspense or frightening material to be found here - methinks some just stop watching it within the first half hour and draw their opinions from that.  Paranormal Activity is the Blair Witch Project of the early twenty-first century, maintaining a large degree of realism and constructing its scares on what the audience doesn't see.  As H.P. Lovecraft once said, ""The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is Fear of the Unknown.""  Once you see the proverbial monster - no matter how frightening it might be - the fear level goes down because you know what you're dealing with.  When you're threatened by the unknown, your imagination runs wild, flooding your system with more and more fear as the situation persists.  Great horror writers know that less is more, and Paranormal Activity demonstrates this concept exceedingly well.The story is actually pretty simple here.  Katie (Katie Featherston) and her boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) are experiencing an escalating series of mysterious night-time frights (bangs, whispered voices, etc.).  This type of haunting activity is no stranger to Katie, as she has experienced similar ""hauntings"" on and off since the age of eight.  For poor dumb Micah, it's essentially an exciting game that he is all too eager to play.  That is why he goes out and buys a video camera and recording equipment, hoping to catch some of the weird activity on film.  While he may claim to believe his girlfriend in the beginning, he doesn't share or appreciate Katie's fears until events begin to spin out of control.  This makes for an increasing amount of tension in the couple's lives, and that only adds to the atmosphere engendered by the paranormal events themselves.  Micah and Katie do make for a believable couple, especially in their increasingly emotional reactions to one another.  Ever the man, Micah dismisses the idea of ghosts or demons, treats the psychic Katie calls in with disdain, and insists over and over again that it is his house and that he will take care of the problem - despite the obvious fact that he has no idea what to do and that, in fact, everything he tries only makes the problem worse.  Truth be told, Micah can be a real jerk at times.The special effects are very low key yet effective.  I think even the ""this film wasn't scary"" crowd would be a tad unnerved if they caught evidence of lights going off and on and doors moving by themselves in their very own homes - let alone saw and heard the things Katie and Micah go on to experience during their increasingly chaotic nights.  Even the more elaborate effects toward the end look real using the home video camera technology this film employs to tell the entire story.  It is astounding, given the film's fifteen thousand dollar budget.  That's right - for less than the price of a new car, newcomer writer/director Oren Peli made a film that grossed well over one hundred million dollars.  Obviously, he had to be doing something right here, and what he was doing was making one of the most surprisingly effective horror films to come along in years.  I've seen Paranormal Activity numerous times already, and I'm more impressed each time I watch it.",5,"An amazingly effective, decidedly creepy film",1316304000,"09 18, 2011",2011,3411,"['Count', 'who', 'consider', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'brilliant', 'scary', 'movie', 'can', 'understand', 'people', 'not', 'liking', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'can', 'get', 'off', 'saying', 'suspense', 'frightening', 'material', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'just', 'stop', 'watching', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'draw', 'opinions', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'early', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'maintaining', 'large', 'degree', 'realism', 'constructing', 'scares', 'what', 'audience', ""n't"", 'see', 'H.P', 'Lovecraft', 'once', 'said', 'oldest', 'strongest', 'emotion', 'mankind', 'fear', 'oldest', 'strongest', 'kind', 'fear', 'Fear', 'Unknown', 'see', 'proverbial', 'monster', 'matter', 'how', 'frightening', 'might', 'be', 'fear', 'level', 'down', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'When', ""'re"", 'threatened', 'unknown', 'imagination', 'wild', 'flooding', 'system', 'more', 'more', 'fear', 'situation', 'Great', 'horror', 'writers', 'know', 'less', 'more', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'concept', 'exceedingly', 'well.The', 'story', 'actually', 'pretty', 'simple', 'here', 'Katie', 'Katie', 'Featherston', 'boyfriend', 'Micah', 'Micah', 'Sloat', 'are', 'experiencing', 'escalating', 'series', 'mysterious', 'night-time', 'frights', 'bangs', 'whispered', 'voices', 'etc.', 'type', 'haunting', 'activity', 'stranger', 'Katie', 'experienced', 'similar', 'hauntings', 'age', 'eight', 'poor', 'dumb', 'Micah', 'essentially', 'exciting', 'game', 'too', 'eager', 'play', 'why', 'out', 'video', 'camera', 'recording', 'equipment', 'hoping', 'catch', 'weird', 'activity', 'film', 'may', 'claim', 'believe', 'girlfriend', 'beginning', ""n't"", 'share', 'appreciate', 'Katie', 'fears', 'events', 'begin', 'spin', 'control', 'increasing', 'amount', 'tension', 'couple', 'lives', 'only', 'atmosphere', 'engendered', 'paranormal', 'events', 'Micah', 'Katie', 'do', 'make', 'believable', 'couple', 'especially', 'increasingly', 'emotional', 'reactions', 'one', 'Ever', 'man', 'Micah', 'idea', 'ghosts', 'demons', 'psychic', 'Katie', 'disdain', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'house', 'will', 'take', 'care', 'problem', 'obvious', 'fact', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'fact', 'everything', 'only', 'problem', 'worse', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'Micah', 'can', 'be', 'real', 'jerk', 'times.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'low', 'key', 'yet', 'effective', 'think', 'even', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'crowd', 'would', 'be', 'tad', 'unnerved', 'caught', 'evidence', 'lights', 'going', 'off', 'doors', 'moving', 'very', 'own', 'homes', 'let', 'alone', 'saw', 'heard', 'things', 'Katie', 'Micah', 'go', 'experience', 'increasingly', 'chaotic', 'nights', 'Even', 'more', 'elaborate', 'effects', 'end', 'look', 'real', 'using', 'home', 'video', 'camera', 'technology', 'film', 'tell', 'entire', 'story', 'astounding', 'given', 'film', 'fifteen', 'thousand', 'dollar', 'budget', 'right', 'less', 'price', 'new', 'car', 'newcomer', 'writer/director', 'Oren', 'Peli', 'made', 'film', 'grossed', 'well', 'one', 'hundred', 'million', 'dollars', 'Obviously', 'had', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'right', 'here', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'making', 'one', 'most', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'horror', 'films', 'come', 'along', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'numerous', 'times', 'already', ""'m"", 'more', 'impressed', 'time', 'watch']",N/A

Just like the original, Paranormal Activity 2 is notable for getting its scares without ever showing very much.  It relies on sound and what we can't see to evoke terror and it's very effective.

1293630,A9NCQGVV5W8N0,B002VKE0XA,"darklordzden ""darklordzden""","[3, 3]","Suburban San Diego, 2006: Micah and Katie are two well-to-do suburbanites who, cosmetically at least, seem to be living the idyllic life of two young lovers in a palatial San Diego house. But Micah and Katie have a problem. Something oddly disquieting appears to have invaded their home. It bangs doors, causes the stairs to creak and makes alarming noises in the middle of the night. Being of a somewhat pugnacious nature, Micah decides to document the phenomenon using a Hi-Def video camera in the hope of getting to the bottom of what is going on - and thanks to his tenacious documentation over the course of twenty one nights during September and October, the viewer is treated to a first-hand account of what happens next.The first-hand docudrama is by now a well worn trope of the horror genre. Films likeThe Legend of Boggy CreekandThe Blair Witch Projecthave attempted to blur the lines of horror and fact by embracing improvised performances and verite style shooting for going on nearly forty years now. When they're done well (as in the case of ""Blair Witch"" and BBC TV'sGhostwatch [Region 2]) they can be genuinely spine-tingling and when they're done badly (as in the case of the execrableGeorge A. Romero's Diary of the Dead) they can be amongst the most painfully awful viewing experiences that one ever has to endure.""Paranormal Activity"" sits somewhere in the middle of these two extremes - its not a terrible documentary horror film, but it's not a particularly good one either.Why is this?Well, largely, because establishing and then maintaining the balance of a documentary horror movie effectively is a very difficult thing to achieve, and director Oren Peli doesn't quite make the grade for a variety of reasons. Chief amongst them is the fact that his two leads don't quite possess the acting chops to carry off the movie; a film like this is either made or broken by it's actors and unfortunately Micha Sloat and Katie Featherstone never really sell the reality of the situation convincingly. The other major failing of the film is it's plotting and pacing. Frankly it all feels a bit too ad hoc and make-shift for it's own good: characters appear and reappear to no discernible effect other than to ham-fistedly suggest a portentous air of ominous foreboding; scenes feel thrown in for the sake of expediency rather than narrative or character progression (the ""let's conveniently leave the house so that the Ouija board can ignite"" scene was, frankly, ridiculously contrived. Given Katie's repeatedly vocalised dislike of the board, wouldn't it have been far more effective - and believable in terms of the character - if she'd thrown it out as the couple were heading out of the house only to find that it had reappeared inside the house upon their return?); back-story which is set-up in the beginning is never elaborated upon to the point that one is mystified by it's inclusion and the twists and turns of the plot are strictly by the numbers.So what are we left with at the end of the day? Well, largely, a film which feels like a series of warmed-over docuhorror clich&eacute;s or a vastly inferior TV movie based on the haunting/possession methodology expounded upon in Gerald Brittle's bookThe Demonologist: The Extraordinary Career of Ed and Lorraine Warren(which, if you want to experience genuine chills, I recommend you pick up - hell, I'm a paranormal skeptic and an agnostic and yet it scared me so much when I first encountered it that I refused to read it after dark). Sure, the much applauded final scene is moderately effective, but even that when you look at it is merely just a combination of the famous ""ghostcam"" e-mail attachment, that did the rounds on the internet a few years ago, as well as scenes from ""Ringu"" and[Rec].Ultimately ""Paranormal Activity"" is a film that doesn't live up the hype. It's worth the price of a rental if you can pick it up for a few bucks, but don't expect anything like the chill-fest that the critics rave about on the front cover.",3,The Thing Going 'Bump In The Night' Here Is This Movie's Credibility Going Through The Floor,1271203200,"04 14, 2010",2010,4013,"['Suburban', 'San', 'Diego', '2006', 'Micah', 'Katie', 'are', 'two', 'well-to-do', 'suburbanites', 'who', 'cosmetically', 'least', 'seem', 'be', 'living', 'idyllic', 'life', 'two', 'young', 'lovers', 'palatial', 'San', 'Diego', 'house', 'Micah', 'Katie', 'have', 'problem', 'Something', 'oddly', 'disquieting', 'have', 'invaded', 'home', 'doors', 'stairs', 'creak', 'alarming', 'noises', 'middle', 'night', 'Being', 'somewhat', 'pugnacious', 'nature', 'Micah', 'document', 'phenomenon', 'using', 'Hi-Def', 'video', 'camera', 'hope', 'getting', 'bottom', 'what', 'going', 'thanks', 'tenacious', 'documentation', 'course', 'twenty', 'one', 'nights', 'September', 'October', 'viewer', 'treated', 'first-hand', 'account', 'what', 'next.The', 'first-hand', 'docudrama', 'now', 'well', 'trope', 'horror', 'genre', 'Films', 'likeThe', 'Legend', 'Boggy', 'CreekandThe', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Projecthave', 'attempted', 'blur', 'lines', 'horror', 'fact', 'embracing', 'improvised', 'performances', 'verite', 'style', 'shooting', 'going', 'nearly', 'forty', 'years', 'now', 'When', ""'re"", 'done', 'well', 'case', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'BBC', ""TV'sGhostwatch"", '[', 'Region', '2', ']', 'can', 'be', 'genuinely', 'spine-tingling', 'when', ""'re"", 'done', 'badly', 'case', 'execrableGeorge', 'A.', 'Romero', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'can', 'be', 'amongst', 'most', 'painfully', 'awful', 'viewing', 'experiences', 'one', 'ever', 'endure', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'sits', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'two', 'extremes', 'not', 'terrible', 'documentary', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'one', 'either.Why', 'Well', 'largely', 'establishing', 'then', 'maintaining', 'balance', 'documentary', 'horror', 'movie', 'effectively', 'very', 'difficult', 'thing', 'achieve', 'director', 'Oren', 'Peli', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'grade', 'variety', 'reasons', 'Chief', 'fact', 'two', 'leads', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'possess', 'acting', 'chops', 'carry', 'off', 'movie', 'film', 'made', 'broken', 'actors', 'unfortunately', 'Micha', 'Sloat', 'Katie', 'Featherstone', 'never', 'really', 'sell', 'reality', 'situation', 'convincingly', 'other', 'major', 'failing', 'film', 'plotting', 'pacing', 'Frankly', 'bit', 'too', 'ad', 'hoc', 'make-shift', 'own', 'good', 'characters', 'appear', 'reappear', 'discernible', 'effect', 'other', 'ham-fistedly', 'suggest', 'portentous', 'air', 'ominous', 'foreboding', 'scenes', 'feel', 'thrown', 'sake', 'expediency', 'rather', 'narrative', 'character', 'progression', 'let', 'conveniently', 'leave', 'house', 'Ouija', 'board', 'can', 'ignite', 'scene', 'was', 'frankly', 'ridiculously', 'contrived', 'Given', 'Katie', 'repeatedly', 'vocalised', 'dislike', 'board', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'believable', 'terms', 'character', ""'d"", 'thrown', 'out', 'couple', 'were', 'heading', 'house', 'only', 'find', 'had', 'reappeared', 'house', 'return', 'back-story', 'set-up', 'beginning', 'never', 'elaborated', 'point', 'one', 'mystified', 'inclusion', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'are', 'strictly', 'numbers.So', 'what', 'are', 'left', 'end', 'day', 'Well', 'largely', 'film', 'series', 'warmed-over', 'docuhorror', 'clich', 'eacute', 'vastly', 'inferior', 'TV', 'movie', 'based', 'haunting/possession', 'methodology', 'expounded', 'upon', 'Gerald', 'Brittle', 'bookThe', 'Demonologist', 'Extraordinary', 'Career', 'Ed', 'Lorraine', 'Warren', 'want', 'experience', 'genuine', 'chills', 'recommend', 'pick', 'up', 'hell', ""'m"", 'paranormal', 'skeptic', 'agnostic', 'yet', 'scared', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'first', 'encountered', 'refused', 'read', 'dark', 'Sure', 'much', 'applauded', 'final', 'scene', 'moderately', 'effective', 'even', 'when', 'look', 'merely', 'just', 'combination', 'famous', 'ghostcam', 'e-mail', 'attachment', 'did', 'rounds', 'internet', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'Ringu', '[', 'Rec', ']', '.Ultimately', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'film', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'price', 'rental', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'few', 'bucks', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'chill-fest', 'critics', 'rave', 'front', 'cover']",N/A

1293634,A1VM6A7HC6CEIH,B002VKE0XA,"David Segrove ""DinA""","[6, 12]","In an age when so many ""horror"" films rely on blood and gore in a sensory-overload attempt to scare people, ""Paranormal Activities"" stands way out from the crowd. It also goes to show that you don't need to spend millions of dollars or hire big names to make a bloody good film.For people who have seen ""Blair Witch"" or ""Cloverfield"", the style of movie will be familiar. It's a home-video style of shoot where the camera is being held by one of the two key players Micah and Katie or is placed on a tripod. Unlike either of the aforementioned movies, however, the camera control in this film is much better and there are few nausea-inducing moments that were more frequent in ""Cloverfield"". Also, the camera being on a tripod for a good part of the film helps keep things steady and allows you to concentrate on what is going on.The story is quite simple. We start the film with Micah testing out his new video camera, purchased to try and record some weird things that have started happening at night in the couple's house. Katie has experience these ""happenings"" off-and-on since childhood and is scared. Micah thinks it's pretty cool and one gets the feeling that he's thinking ""reality show"" down the road.The camera is placed in a corner of the room, the couple goes to sleep and...things start happening.What is absolutely brilliant is that, whether you ""believe"" or not, you're sucked into the story and the action. Director Oren Peli doesn't beat you up with effects. He's taken the ""less is more"" approach that is so sorely lacking in 99% of current ""horror"" films and uses it, at first to give you goosebumps and, as the film progresses, scare the hell out of you. There are many scenes where the build up is worse than the fright. There is no music to let you know what's about to happen. This is, after all, ""home movie"", but what does happen us just plausible enough and, when mixed with the daytime interaction between Micah and Katie, that we end up thinking ""get out of the damn house"". Except they can't.The only other actors in the film are a friend of Katie's who is really just ""there"" and a Psychic who tells the couple that they're not being haunted by ghosts but something he can't help them with...though he knows someone who can.Anyway, without trying to give away too much, events get more freaky. The camera records a lot, sometimes fast-forwarding through the night until we get to an ""action"" scene. Peli uses the time indicator to excellent effect and one's eyes keep wandering to the lower right part of the screen, somewhat hoping that it's going to be dawn soon.The ending is brilliant and perfect.If you're looking for blood and gore, this isn't it. If you don't like the ""found footage"" style of movie, then this isn't for you either, though the way Peli has directed it makes it much easier to watch more believable that either ""Blair Witch"" or ""Cloverfield"". There were parts of these films that left you thinking ""put the camera down, you can't have this conversation with a camera in hand"". In ""Paranormal"", the camera is put down, conversations happen out of frame, and all to good effect.Using unknown actors in a film like this helps make it more believable. I couldn't believe some reports I read that Hollywood was considering a remake using ""named"" actors. The trouble is, they'd have ruined it because, for some reason, they feel the need to ""show"" rather than ""tell"". Movies such as ""The Haunting"" remake are very obvious proof of this.I'm very glad this film was released ""as is"". It's surprisingly easy to suspend belief and get caught up in the atmosphere. I've never been so frightened, and I don't scare easily. Perhaps it was because of a theater full of people who gasped aloud when I did.We all bought it for an hour and a half.I hope that there are more true ""independent"" movies like this to come, where the art of film-making is not secondary to effects and big budgets.If you want a good fright, then go and see ""Paranormal Activities""...and take some clean underwear.",5,Brilliant,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,4028,"['age', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'rely', 'blood', 'gore', 'sensory-overload', 'attempt', 'scare', 'people', 'Paranormal', 'Activities', 'way', 'crowd', 'also', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'spend', 'millions', 'dollars', 'hire', 'big', 'names', 'make', 'bloody', 'good', 'film.For', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Cloverfield', 'style', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'home-video', 'style', 'shoot', 'where', 'camera', 'being', 'held', 'one', 'two', 'key', 'players', 'Micah', 'Katie', 'placed', 'tripod', 'aforementioned', 'movies', 'however', 'camera', 'control', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'are', 'few', 'nausea-inducing', 'moments', 'were', 'more', 'frequent', 'Cloverfield', 'Also', 'camera', 'being', 'tripod', 'good', 'part', 'film', 'keep', 'things', 'steady', 'concentrate', 'what', 'going', 'on.The', 'story', 'quite', 'simple', 'start', 'film', 'Micah', 'testing', 'out', 'new', 'video', 'camera', 'purchased', 'try', 'record', 'weird', 'things', 'have', 'started', 'happening', 'night', 'couple', 'house', 'Katie', 'experience', 'happenings', 'off-and-on', 'childhood', 'scared', 'Micah', 'pretty', 'cool', 'one', 'feeling', 'thinking', 'reality', 'show', 'down', 'road.The', 'camera', 'placed', 'corner', 'room', 'couple', 'sleep', 'things', 'start', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'believe', 'not', ""'re"", 'sucked', 'story', 'action', 'Director', 'Oren', 'Peli', ""n't"", 'beat', 'up', 'effects', 'taken', 'less', 'more', 'approach', 'so', 'sorely', 'lacking', '99', '%', 'current', 'horror', 'films', 'first', 'give', 'goosebumps', 'film', 'scare', 'hell', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'build', 'up', 'worse', 'fright', 'music', 'let', 'know', 'what', 'about', 'happen', 'home', 'movie', 'what', 'happen', 'just', 'plausible', 'enough', 'when', 'mixed', 'daytime', 'interaction', 'Micah', 'Katie', 'end', 'up', 'thinking', 'get', 'damn', 'house', ""can't.The"", 'only', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'are', 'friend', 'Katie', 'who', 'really', 'just', 'there', 'Psychic', 'who', 'couple', ""'re"", 'not', 'being', 'haunted', 'ghosts', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'someone', 'who', 'can.Anyway', 'trying', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'events', 'get', 'more', 'freaky', 'camera', 'lot', 'sometimes', 'fast-forwarding', 'night', 'get', 'action', 'scene', 'Peli', 'time', 'indicator', 'excellent', 'effect', 'one', 'eyes', 'keep', 'wandering', 'lower', 'right', 'part', 'screen', 'somewhat', 'hoping', 'going', 'be', 'dawn', 'soon.The', 'ending', 'brilliant', 'perfect.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'blood', 'gore', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'found', 'footage', 'style', 'movie', 'then', ""n't"", 'way', 'Peli', 'directed', 'much', 'easier', 'watch', 'more', 'believable', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Cloverfield', 'were', 'parts', 'films', 'left', 'thinking', 'put', 'camera', 'down', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'conversation', 'camera', 'hand', 'Paranormal', 'camera', 'put', 'down', 'conversations', 'happen', 'frame', 'good', 'effect.Using', 'unknown', 'actors', 'film', 'make', 'more', 'believable', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'reports', 'read', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'considering', 'remake', 'using', 'named', 'actors', 'trouble', ""'d"", 'have', 'ruined', 'reason', 'feel', 'need', 'show', 'rather', 'tell', 'Movies', 'such', 'Haunting', 'remake', 'are', 'very', 'obvious', 'proof', 'this.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'surprisingly', 'easy', 'suspend', 'belief', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'atmosphere', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'so', 'frightened', 'do', ""n't"", 'scare', 'easily', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'theater', 'full', 'people', 'who', 'gasped', 'aloud', 'when', 'did.We', 'bought', 'hour', 'half.I', 'hope', 'are', 'more', 'true', 'independent', 'movies', 'come', 'where', 'art', 'film-making', 'not', 'secondary', 'effects', 'big', 'budgets.If', 'want', 'good', 'fright', 'then', 'go', 'see', 'Paranormal', 'Activities', 'take', 'clean', 'underwear']",N/A

My only disappointment is that the way it was released made it not at all scary for me.

I mean don't get me wrong I jumped and had several Holy moley exclamations and one cover my mouth in sheer OMG moment, but I was expecting to be scared the way I was after Blair Witch (I still refuse to go camping to this day).This is a movie that in order to get the full effect you have to go in with no expectations, with as little knowledge about what you are about to see as possible.  The problem for me was that ever since I caught the first glimpse of this on line I wanted to see it and I read every article and watched every trailer I could find.  I wasn't lucky enough to be in a market to see this early.  I was able to see Blair Witch before they came out and said it wasn't real.  I actually waited through the credits just to see that little disclaimer at the end that says it was fictitious(sp?).I give it 3.5 stars based on it being a really quality horror film with genuine scares throughout, but as far as it being marketed as the scariest movie ever made?  Not even close.  I think if they had just given it a wide release and didn't hype it to death I could have seen it without knowing much if anything about it and I probably would have lost some sleep over every little bump or step I heard in my apartment, but I didn't.  This has 5-star potential but just doesn't deliver on the lasting impression.  There was too much ""down time""  I found myself thinking ""He got the camera to record the strange things going on at night.  Why am I watching them eat breakfast and not even talking to eachother?""  There was never any sustained fright or tension.  There would be a really good tense scary moment at night and then 10 minutes of them complaining about not getting enough sleep or eating or Micah playing guitar or Katie and her friend making bead necklaces.  The night scene would get me worked up and a little jumpy and nervous but then time to relax and not worry about anything until they go to bed again and by that time I was completely relaxed and settled down again.Over all I'd definately recommend seeing it if you want to see a well made documentary style horror movie, but don't expect to be scared out of your mind unless you've been living under a rock for the past few months.  And don't bother with the DVD/Blu-ray release unless you have a good surround sound system or if you are curious (as I am) about the other two endings they didn't use.",3,I knew too much going in...,1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,2742,"[""'m"", 'scoring', 'film', '3.5', 'stars', 'based', 'fact', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'story', 'only', 'disappointment', 'way', 'was', 'released', 'made', 'not', 'scary', ""'m"", 'sure', '4', 'inconsiderate', 'jerks', '2', 'rows', 'who', 'complained', 'how', 'bored', 'were', 'tried', 'be', 'funny', 'whole', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'jumped', 'had', 'several', 'Holy', 'moley', 'exclamations', 'one', 'cover', 'mouth', 'sheer', 'OMG', 'moment', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'scared', 'way', 'was', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'still', 'refuse', 'go', 'camping', 'day', '.This', 'movie', 'order', 'get', 'full', 'effect', 'have', 'go', 'expectations', 'as', 'little', 'knowledge', 'what', 'are', 'see', 'possible', 'problem', 'was', 'ever', 'caught', 'first', 'glimpse', 'line', 'wanted', 'see', 'read', 'article', 'watched', 'trailer', 'could', 'find', 'was', ""n't"", 'lucky', 'enough', 'be', 'market', 'see', 'early', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'came', 'out', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'actually', 'waited', 'credits', 'just', 'see', 'little', 'disclaimer', 'end', 'was', 'fictitious', 'sp', '.I', 'give', '3.5', 'stars', 'based', 'being', 'really', 'quality', 'horror', 'film', 'genuine', 'scares', 'as', 'far', 'being', 'marketed', 'scariest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'Not', 'even', 'close', 'think', 'had', 'just', 'given', 'wide', 'release', 'did', ""n't"", 'hype', 'death', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'knowing', 'much', 'anything', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'sleep', 'little', 'bump', 'step', 'heard', 'apartment', 'did', ""n't"", '5-star', 'potential', 'just', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'lasting', 'impression', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'down', 'time', 'found', 'thinking', 'got', 'camera', 'record', 'strange', 'things', 'going', 'night', 'Why', 'am', 'watching', 'eat', 'breakfast', 'not', 'even', 'talking', 'eachother', 'was', 'never', 'sustained', 'fright', 'tension', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'tense', 'scary', 'moment', 'night', 'then', '10', 'minutes', 'complaining', 'not', 'getting', 'enough', 'sleep', 'eating', 'Micah', 'playing', 'guitar', 'Katie', 'friend', 'making', 'bead', 'necklaces', 'night', 'scene', 'would', 'get', 'worked', 'up', 'little', 'jumpy', 'nervous', 'then', 'time', 'relax', 'not', 'worry', 'anything', 'go', 'bed', 'again', 'time', 'was', 'completely', 'relaxed', 'settled', 'down', 'again.Over', ""'d"", 'definately', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'want', 'see', 'well', 'made', 'documentary', 'style', 'horror', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'scared', 'mind', ""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'rock', 'past', 'few', 'months', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'DVD/Blu-ray', 'release', 'have', 'good', 'surround', 'sound', 'system', 'are', 'curious', 'am', 'other', 'two', 'endings', 'did', ""n't"", 'use']",N/A
1293640,AQKLGDNJJAFPK,B002VKE0XA,dj,"[0, 0]","First off, I'm not a fan of the horror genre at all. I grew up in the 80s when horror films were made over-the-top (Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Child's Play, etc.). So perhaps when my fiance recommended we watch this together, I was a bit reluctant, and also expecting the same experience from those other films.This is quite different, as others have noted. It is extremely low budget, but probably also gained one of the highest return on investment ratios in the business. And it is deeply entertaining. It's so entertaining I ran down to the video store and bought a copy.The premise is simple enough - there are bumps in the night, and the couple suspects it might be paranormal. So they set up a night vision camera, an EVP recorder, and then go to bed. A number of increasingly bizarre things happen in the night which climax into a shocking ending. I won't spoil it. Overall, I was deeply entertained by the film, I found myself straining my eyes and ears at times to try to anticipate or spot the unusual disturbances, and was surprised how quickly time passed when it was over. And for me, that's indicative that I've seen a good film.Only two gripes of mine (mild spoiler alert): 1) you owe it to yourself to watch the film with a good sound system. The stock speakers on your TV will serve you well for the highlight of the unusual activity, but with a decent sound system or headphones, some of the ""thumps"" or moans you hear will build the anticipation and climax for many of the scenes. So keep that in mind. 2) It was all so well-done, but the scene with the Ouija board looked pretty bad from the visual effects perspective, and was a bit over-the-top given the previous events that lead up to it. But otherwise all the other scary scenes overshadow the Ouija board scene and allow me to forgive its cheesiness.As a non-believer in the genre, this film got me to reconsider ""spook"" films (honestly I don't think this one qualifies as ""horror,"" even though that's where it was categorized at my local video store). I look forward to seeing the next two in the series.",4,"Pleasantly surprised... and spooked!

1293650,A5QCKO0LL1D5E,B002VKE0XA,dv_forever,"[3, 9]","I heard about this movie more than a year ago. I read about it in an independent filmmaker magazine. At the time the studio that bought the movie was thinking of shelving this flick and letting the director remake it as a mainstream horror film with a real budget. Thankfully they came to their senses and released it ""Blair Witch"" bare bones style aided by an underground marketing blitz. Obviously it worked as this $15,000 film is raking in the big bucks nationwide. I knew as soon as I read about this movie over a year ago that it had the makings of a Blair Witch type reception at the box office because people are deeply uninformed and can easily fall victim to the hype of real events or supposed true stories. The whole Blair Witch marketing scheme was based on lying to potential moviegoers and getting them to think that it was real footage of real events and real people died. Thankfully ""Paranormal Activity"" does not fall to such pathetic gimmicks in it's aim to make the big bucks.I did not want to see this film until it was released on DVD but a friend that I had not seen in years suggested we attend a midnight screening of the movie. This was weeks before it opened nationwide. We waited for more than an hour in line, ( I have never waited for a movie before in my entire life and I'm a movie buff ), but the wait wasn't so bad as it gave us a chance to catch up and talk film. Upon entering the movie theater, it was packed wall to wall with people. I live in a well known college town so I knew immeadiately that the marketing gimmicks had worked and this movie was going to do blockbuster business when released coast to coast. The audience was full of drunks and stoners of all kinds. Films like this and Blair Witch should be watched in either of two ways... either with a bunch of drunks and stoners at a midnight screening or alone by yourself in an empty theater.The film itself was exactly as I imagined it would be. Unpretentious, basic scares, very minimalistic design as ordained by budgetary concerns. I am a filmmaker myself and of course it's great to see a bare bones film like this succeed financially in a sea of disgusting mainstream slime like the ""Saw"" series. I was delighted that Paranormal Activity beat up on the latest Saw flick this past weekend at the box office. However, an underdog success story still does not make a good movie. This film is not even remotely scary, even though all the drunks and stoners kept jumping up at even the silliest scares! It was more about a communal atmosphere than a genuinely scary movie, which are very rare indeed.The characters were your standard issue boring twenty somethings living together in unwedded bliss until a demonic presence begins to haunt their house. From then on all the horror cliches you known and are tired to death of start creeping into the movie. I couldn't wait for everyone to die. It's a long time coming. The film drags in the middle portion and we the viewers are never allowed outside of the house. This has nothing to do with the ridiculous plot device that the demon will follow the woman anywhere she goes. It has everything to do with the fact that the movie was made on the tightest of budgets and could only afford one location. Are these characters at all realistic? If a demonic presence was messing with you in your house, would you not skip at least a night or two in your home? Maybe go to a friend's house, hotel or something? Give me a break! Anyway, some of the effects shots were pretty sweet for such a low budget film.How does this movie rank against ""The Blair Witch Project""? I really did not like Blair Witch upon it's release and I resented the fact that the marketing department had to lie to people to buy the product. I research things like this so of course I was not fooled but let me tell you... back in 1999 when Blair Witch came out, I was working in a video store and people came up to me all the time as they were renting Blair Witch and asked me, ""Is this for real? Did these people die?"" Yes, human beings are that gullible and idiotic and marketing people prey on that. After I watched Paranormal Activity, I went and saw Blair Witch again for the first time in a decade. I greatly enjoyed Blair Witch more the second time around without all the fuss. Blair Witch has a vital ingredient that horror films should absolutely have and that Paranormal Activity sorely lacks and that ingredient is atmosphere. Spending an hour and a half in a house with two idiots in their bedroom is far less atmospheric than a group of four trecking through the woods and getting lost for days. The location shooting is vital for Blair Witch, night time, daytime, surrounding the actors with nature and pitting them against the elements and the supernatural horrors around them. Plus that film not only had consumer grade camerawork but also 16mm black and white footage to give the film an artsy look. For my money, Blair Witch still keeps the crown for tiny budgeted horror films with over the top marketing hype! Paranormal Activity is an average boo and bump in the night flick. You won't miss much by waiting for the DVD release.

1293653,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B002VKE0XA,Elisabeth,"[1, 2]","** This review contains spoilers **I thought the Blair Witch Project was successful because the scares were dependent more on what you didn't see than on what you did.  Paranormal Activity is successful for the same reason.  Replacing blood and gore are strange sounds in the night, doors that open and close on their own, and other oddities.Even though, like the Blair Witch Project, I knew this wasn't real footage, it still had a definite creep factor to it.  I especially liked the scenes where the woman gets up in the middle of the night, stands at the foot of the bed and just stares at her boyfriend....for hours! It plays on that fear of the unknown - of not ever really knowing who your partner is lying next to you at night...of not knowing if they could ever turn on you.I also liked the progression of the hauntings in this film, too.  You see the entity testing how powerful it can be and then grows more confident as the story unfolds.  Again, this is successful because you don't see much...just shadows and moving objects...but is still successful because of that fear of the unknown - you don't know what this entity is that's haunting this couple.I would've liked more explanation on this entity, though.  Why did it track this woman since she was 8?  Why did it wait 'till now to get aggressive?  Why was it so threatened by her boyfriend?  Did it not like him because he was interferring...or was this really about getting to him the whole time?Answers to these questions would've given this movie more depth.I also would've liked a better ending, too.  Not that the ending was terrible, but was a little cheesy and gave away too much.  What made this movie so successful thus far was not giving away too much.If I had to change the ending, I still would've kept the part where the boyfriend goes downstairs, yells in fear, and then you hear a loud thump followed by silence.  The part I would've changed was what happens next -- after some time passed, it would've been cooler if the girlfriend had walked, or even crawled, through the bedroom doorway, looked up at the camera so we see her mouth and clothes covered in blood and then -- without the cheesy smile -- raised her hand up towards the camera and the camera tips over on it's own, ending the movie.That would be enough information to let you know what her powers were and how she killed him.Overall, though, I enjoyed watching this naturalistic type of horror story.",4,"If you liked the Blair Witch Project, then you'll like this",1318636800,"10 15, 2011",2011,2449,"['**', 'review', 'spoilers', '**I', 'thought', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'was', 'successful', 'scares', 'were', 'dependent', 'more', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'did', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'successful', 'same', 'reason', 'Replacing', 'blood', 'gore', 'are', 'strange', 'sounds', 'night', 'doors', 'open', 'close', 'own', 'other', 'oddities.Even', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'knew', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'footage', 'still', 'had', 'definite', 'creep', 'factor', 'especially', 'liked', 'scenes', 'where', 'woman', 'up', 'middle', 'night', 'foot', 'bed', 'just', 'stares', 'boyfriend', '.for', 'hours', 'fear', 'unknown', 'not', 'ever', 'really', 'knowing', 'who', 'partner', 'lying', 'next', 'night', 'not', 'knowing', 'could', 'ever', 'turn', 'you.I', 'also', 'liked', 'progression', 'hauntings', 'film', 'too', 'see', 'entity', 'testing', 'how', 'powerful', 'can', 'be', 'then', 'more', 'confident', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Again', 'successful', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'just', 'shadows', 'moving', 'objects', 'still', 'successful', 'fear', 'unknown', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'entity', 'haunting', 'couple.I', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'more', 'explanation', 'entity', 'though', 'Why', 'did', 'track', 'woman', 'was', '8', 'Why', 'did', 'wait', ""'till"", 'now', 'get', 'aggressive', 'Why', 'was', 'so', 'threatened', 'boyfriend', 'Did', 'not', 'was', 'interferring', 'was', 'really', 'getting', 'whole', 'time', 'Answers', 'questions', 'would', ""'ve"", 'given', 'movie', 'more', 'depth.I', 'also', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'better', 'ending', 'too', 'Not', 'ending', 'was', 'terrible', 'was', 'little', 'cheesy', 'gave', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'What', 'made', 'movie', 'so', 'successful', 'thus', 'far', 'was', 'not', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much.If', 'had', 'change', 'ending', 'still', 'would', ""'ve"", 'kept', 'part', 'where', 'boyfriend', 'downstairs', 'yells', 'fear', 'then', 'hear', 'loud', 'thump', 'followed', 'silence', 'part', 'would', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'was', 'what', 'next', 'time', 'passed', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cooler', 'girlfriend', 'had', 'walked', 'even', 'crawled', 'bedroom', 'doorway', 'looked', 'up', 'camera', 'see', 'mouth', 'clothes', 'covered', 'blood', 'then', 'cheesy', 'smile', 'raised', 'hand', 'up', 'camera', 'camera', 'own', 'ending', 'movie.That', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'information', 'let', 'know', 'what', 'powers', 'were', 'how', 'killed', 'him.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'naturalistic', 'type', 'horror', 'story']",N/A

This movie definitely falls into the 'creepy' category.  Rather than explicitly showing you or explaining everything about what's going on, this movie relies on suspense and imagination, hinting at what's happening and leaving the rest up to your imagination.  In my opinion, that technique is far more effective in providing a creepy experience than a bloody slasher movie.  As another reviewer (James Morris) has said, movies that let you use your own imagination can often be far more scary than movies that explicitly show everything, because when you use your imagination, your mind draws on your worst fears.  This is the type of movie that may leave you nervous/scared for a while after you've finished watching it.I particularly like the use of audio in this movie.

Also, using my imagination creates better fear and terror than all the gore in most modern horror movies can fill. Therefore, I was very disappointed that ""Paranormal Activity"" was such a big yawn that when the finale actually came I didn't even jump out of my skin.As for what this film is about others have already written but what I finally realized that didn't work for me is that this is like the TV program, ""Paranormal State"", put onto film. For those not aware, ""Paranormal State"" is about a  bunch of Penn State students who investigate paranormal activity in various places. So, in ""Paranormal Activity"" not only do we have two truly green morons trying to solve what this haunting is about but they don't bother to know why and how it all started. They don't have proper tools to conduct paranormal research just the video camera trying to capture paranormal happenings. Big deal! The documentary style video journal really loses all the mystery and atmosphere trying so hard to be scary.

1293661,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B002VKE0XA,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[0, 3]","Movies such as Paranormal Activity come down to a horror fan's tastes. A gore and slasher--type horror fan may not find this movie quite as enjoyable, because it's subtleness, using bits and pieces of brief, unsettling moments to ""get under your skin."". Personally, I think movies in the vain of Saw, Hostel, Day of the Dawn, etc. have become too repetitive and predictable. They give you so many scares throughout that nothing in the film has any impact later on, say in the film's final moments. Everything that is scary is usually out in plain view, and these films are more visual in their attempts to frighten. This is where film such as The Blair Witch Project, The Haunting, The Exorcist and  Paranormal Activity differ. They excel in taking the ""less is more"" approach; they give you brief moments which disturb you, but these foreshadow an even more disturbing end. As we see strange occurrences during the wee hours of the night--ambiguous noises, a slight moving of the door, perhaps a strange voice--there is an unseen force working against the couple. The unsettling atmosphere in Paranormal Activity comes from not only seeing strange occurrences during the night, but the anticipation and suspense of waiting for something terrifying to happen. As you learn about Katie's past, you sense that a demonic experience is imminent. Some viewers may scoff at the daytime scenes as being ""boring"" or ""uneventful"", but these moments of relative calm are sharply contrasted with the eeriness of each succeeding night, giving the night scenes an even more foreboding quality.Many people compare Paranormal Activity to The Blair Witch Project in its indie, amateur, home-style video ""real life"" documentary ways, but I think that Blair Witch was vastly creepier, and had more logic to its plot. One of the things that irked me was Micah's way of being so antagonistic towards the entity, and his behavior  was (for lack of better word) moronic at times. Clearly this guy has no sense, and seems to be doing everything in his power to invite demonic forces inside the home, such as yelling at it, and then later buying a Ouija board. The fact that Katie stays with this guy, despite his obvious recklessness and immaturity, is puzzling. One scene that seemed unnecessary added in was the second visit by the psychic. He can't stay, he tells the couple, because the presence doesn't want him there, and is gone in a few seconds. Despite a few flaws here, I still felt it was a solid film.Horror films should not be solely on what scares viewers during the film, but how it affects them afterwards. This is one of those films that might make you think twice when you hear something during the night in an otherwise silent house. It is the same fear that you might have had to go into the water after watching Jaws, or into the woods after watching The Blair Witch Project.The hype given to this film before, during and after its release probably didn't help it, and Paranormal Activity would have been better to fly under the radar, mainly because it doesn't appeal to most. Still, for what it's worth, I praise a horror movie that can create spooks with what you don't see rather than what you do.",4,"Some flaws, but unsettling atmosphere makes it work",1267315200,"02 28, 2010",2010,3199,"['Movies', 'such', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'come', 'down', 'horror', 'fan', 'tastes', 'gore', 'slasher', 'type', 'horror', 'fan', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'movie', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'subtleness', 'using', 'bits', 'pieces', 'brief', 'unsettling', 'moments', 'get', 'skin.', 'Personally', 'think', 'movies', 'vain', 'Saw', 'Hostel', 'Day', 'Dawn', 'etc', 'have', 'become', 'too', 'repetitive', 'predictable', 'give', 'so', 'many', 'scares', 'nothing', 'film', 'impact', 'later', 'say', 'film', 'final', 'moments', 'Everything', 'scary', 'usually', 'out', 'plain', 'view', 'films', 'are', 'more', 'visual', 'attempts', 'frighten', 'where', 'film', 'such', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Haunting', 'Exorcist', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'differ', 'excel', 'taking', 'less', 'more', 'approach', 'give', 'brief', 'moments', 'disturb', 'foreshadow', 'even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'end', 'see', 'strange', 'occurrences', 'wee', 'hours', 'night', 'ambiguous', 'noises', 'slight', 'moving', 'door', 'perhaps', 'strange', 'voice', 'unseen', 'force', 'working', 'couple', 'unsettling', 'atmosphere', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'not', 'only', 'seeing', 'strange', 'occurrences', 'night', 'anticipation', 'suspense', 'waiting', 'something', 'terrifying', 'happen', 'learn', 'Katie', 'past', 'sense', 'demonic', 'experience', 'imminent', 'viewers', 'may', 'scoff', 'daytime', 'scenes', 'being', 'boring', 'uneventful', 'moments', 'relative', 'calm', 'are', 'sharply', 'contrasted', 'eeriness', 'succeeding', 'night', 'giving', 'night', 'even', 'more', 'foreboding', 'quality.Many', 'people', 'compare', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'indie', 'amateur', 'home-style', 'video', 'real', 'life', 'documentary', 'ways', 'think', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'was', 'vastly', 'creepier', 'had', 'more', 'logic', 'plot', 'One', 'things', 'irked', 'was', 'Micah', 'way', 'being', 'so', 'antagonistic', 'entity', 'behavior', 'was', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'moronic', 'times', 'Clearly', 'guy', 'sense', 'be', 'doing', 'everything', 'power', 'invite', 'demonic', 'forces', 'home', 'such', 'yelling', 'then', 'later', 'buying', 'Ouija', 'board', 'fact', 'Katie', 'guy', 'obvious', 'recklessness', 'immaturity', 'puzzling', 'One', 'scene', 'seemed', 'unnecessary', 'added', 'was', 'second', 'visit', 'psychic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'couple', 'presence', ""n't"", 'want', 'there', 'gone', 'few', 'seconds', 'few', 'flaws', 'here', 'still', 'felt', 'was', 'solid', 'film.Horror', 'films', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'solely', 'what', 'viewers', 'film', 'how', 'afterwards', 'one', 'films', 'might', 'make', 'think', 'twice', 'when', 'hear', 'something', 'night', 'otherwise', 'silent', 'house', 'same', 'fear', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'go', 'water', 'watching', 'Jaws', 'woods', 'watching', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project.The', 'hype', 'given', 'film', 'release', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'fly', 'radar', 'mainly', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'most', 'Still', 'what', 'worth', 'praise', 'horror', 'movie', 'can', 'create', 'spooks', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'rather', 'what', 'do']",N/A

Girlfriend complains about hearing strange noises in the house and boyfriend decides to set up a camera in the bedroom to document this suspected paranormal activity (Hence the name of the film) The film then shot mostly from the perspective of one or the other couple holding the camera documents the following 3 weeks and what happens.The big plus of this (Especially if you are in charge of the films budget) Is you have a very small cast.  The couple, a psychic, a friend who comes to visit and of course the ghost/demon. That is not to detract from the film in any way because the film is actually pretty good.  For a start the film goes right into the plot.  There is no sitting around waiting for something to happen you pretty much get an introduction from the Micha (The boyfriend) Of his intention to document what his happening to them then its on with the film.  Because its shot from the perspective of someone documenting their own lives its edited accordingly so the pot is very free flowing rather than going off in tangents like a normal feature film can often do.  There are no real special effects (To speak of) So to compensate for this the director has used silence to scare the audience.  You will be siting in front of the TV while the couple sleep waiting for something to happen, the silence playing on your mind, did you hear something?  Did you see something in the corner of the screen? Then BANG! It happens. In a way its similar to some Japanese horror movies in that its low on gore and more on psychological scares.  Things start to escalate in the house as the days pass until they reach a conclusion that you probably didnt expect.I did like the case in this film, Micha playing the rational boyfriend very well (Though it can get a bit tedious)  The only thing that was a bit silly was their constant need to keep the lights off and rather run around in pitch dark with only a camera light to guide them (Really if the idea was that some psychotic demon was possessing the house tying to harm them the last thing you would be doing is running about in the dark)  Aside from that I have to say I enjoyed this film.",4,Blair Witch goes to Suburbia,1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,2468,"['Have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'possibly', 'watched', 'media', 'hype', 'so', 'didnt', 'see', 'expecting', 'be', 'best', 'thing', 'sliced', 'did', 'watch', 'hoping', 'be', 'awful', 'could', 'slate', 'amongst', 'friends.The', 'plot', 'everyone', 'suburban', 'couple', 'boyfriend', 'girlfriend', 'Girlfriend', 'complains', 'hearing', 'strange', 'noises', 'house', 'boyfriend', 'decides', 'set', 'up', 'camera', 'bedroom', 'document', 'suspected', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'Hence', 'name', 'film', 'film', 'then', 'shot', 'mostly', 'perspective', 'one', 'other', 'couple', 'holding', 'camera', 'documents', 'following', '3', 'weeks', 'what', 'happens.The', 'big', 'plus', 'Especially', 'are', 'charge', 'films', 'budget', 'have', 'very', 'small', 'cast', 'couple', 'psychic', 'friend', 'who', 'visit', 'course', 'ghost/demon', 'not', 'detract', 'film', 'way', 'film', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'start', 'film', 'right', 'plot', 'sitting', 'around', 'waiting', 'something', 'happen', 'pretty', 'much', 'get', 'introduction', 'Micha', 'boyfriend', 'intention', 'document', 'what', 'happening', 'then', 'film', 'shot', 'perspective', 'someone', 'documenting', 'own', 'edited', 'accordingly', 'pot', 'very', 'free', 'flowing', 'rather', 'going', 'off', 'tangents', 'normal', 'feature', 'film', 'can', 'often', 'do', 'are', 'real', 'special', 'effects', 'speak', 'So', 'compensate', 'director', 'used', 'silence', 'scare', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'siting', 'front', 'TV', 'couple', 'sleep', 'waiting', 'something', 'happen', 'silence', 'playing', 'mind', 'did', 'hear', 'something', 'Did', 'see', 'something', 'corner', 'screen', 'Then', 'BANG', 'way', 'similar', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'movies', 'low', 'gore', 'more', 'psychological', 'scares', 'Things', 'start', 'escalate', 'house', 'days', 'pass', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'probably', 'didnt', 'expect.I', 'did', 'case', 'film', 'Micha', 'playing', 'rational', 'boyfriend', 'very', 'well', 'can', 'get', 'bit', 'tedious', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'bit', 'silly', 'was', 'constant', 'need', 'keep', 'lights', 'rather', 'run', 'around', 'pitch', 'dark', 'only', 'camera', 'light', 'guide', 'Really', 'idea', 'was', 'psychotic', 'demon', 'was', 'possessing', 'house', 'tying', 'harm', 'last', 'thing', 'would', 'be', 'doing', 'running', 'about', 'dark', 'Aside', 'have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'film']",N/A
1293672,A13O1YCZCYT76I,B002VKE0XA,Greg,"[0, 0]","Well, it's that time again, time for another damn Paranormal Activity movie. In sarcastic celebration of the release of the 4th (Christ almighty, 4th?) of these movies, I thought I'd revisit the one that started it all. The film that, much like the saw movies, somehow launched a franchise while simultaneously helping no one's career. ...how the hell does that happen, anyway?So I'm sure by now everyone knows the basic premise: a couple of young professionals are being haunted (or hunted) by a nameless demon thing. The boyfriend buys a fancy camera to bring the audience along for the ride and we peek in as events go from bad to worse to please-just-get-help-already. It's becoming a well-worn formula, but Paranormal Activity managed a little bit of movie magic - sitting at that weird cross section of right time/right place, memorable gimmick, and excellent marketing campaign that can make a movie a success in the face of mixed audience reactions.The polarizing nature of the film, and the love-hate reactions, are what I want to talk about most. Because, overall, I'd say it's a pretty quality (if low budget) production. It takes itself seriously, the pacing is good, and the story is simple but escalates the danger and the stakes at the appropriate times. What few effects are used are well done; simple but flawless. You never see the strings or the magician's hands at work. We get a very solid and honest performance from Katie Featherston. And this demon, this haunting presence, feels well developed. Even though we never get to see it, I get the impression it has a personality and maybe a look that writer could describe. And the tactics it uses kind of make sense, in a creepy, wife-beating, eternal spirit sort of way. So, yeah, the bones of a well done production are there. The key to whether you love or hate it is whether or not you give a damn.I seriously mean that. It all rests on whether or not you develop empathy for the characters, for their situation; whether or not you can project yourself into it. Not SYMPATHY, mind you, it doesn't matter whether or not you LIKE these people, but empathy; whether or not you can see yourself in their shoes. Because, like I said, the story is incredibly simplistic. The couple does almost nothing to better their situation, so there's almost no real struggle against their antagonist and you could argue that its 90 minutes of people reacting. The effects are very simple; moving doors, moving shadows, bits of noise. Compare it to something like, I don't know, Drag Me to Hell for example, which is a traditionally told story with a ton of conflict, a ton of struggle and lots of loud things thrown at the camera; Paranormal Activity is practically a 'slice of life' movie when compared to something like that.BUT!!! If you get sucked in, like I did, the fact that the things happening are so small becomes terrifying! If those things were happening to ME, if my lights were going on and off, if I could see demon breath on my girlfriend's should, I'd about lose my mind. Once the movie's got your imagination, once you've put yourself there - this is my house, my boyfriend, my life - it becomes a masterpiece of pacing and atmosphere. This home, this place that SHOULD be safe, is now corrupted by a dangerous, creepy, rapey little demon. Every little thing, every light switch, the tv, the bed, becomes a danger. Nowhere is safe. This movie infects my mind and, when I'm watching it, every little thing in my home becomes suspect. The clicks from the heater set me off; the rattle in the pipe makes me jump. Because it's the little things, the little creaks and groans, that mean SOMETHING IS WATCHING YOU!The problem is that it all hinges on that one thing, on grabbing the audience's empathy. If that doesn't happen for you (and that's the movie's fault, not yours) it is quite boring. There's no real story, no real effects, no graphic sex scenes. Just two people living a particularly awful period of their lives (like a Chekhovian ghost story).And I don't want to talk about the ending. There are three of them on the DVD, and I think even more on YouTube, so pick your favorite and go with that. They went with the least nihilistic one for the theatrical release, because that was the smartest thing to do from a marketing perspective. Audiences hate nihilistic endings, that's just how it is, and if everyone's dead it's harder to make sequels. We could argue about that all day, and I don't want to. The ending they ultimately picked is one, last, big jump scare that brings this particular story, these two people in this house, to a logical conclusion. On that level, it works just fine for me.All that said, I have to say that Paranormal Activity remains one of my favorite scary movies. It's a personal choice, but the movie hits all the right buttons for me and none of the wrong ones. It's subtle and subdued while still being imaginative and honest. And, these days, that is something special indeed.BOO!!!",5,Buenos Dia de los Muertos!,1351728000,"11 1, 2012",2012,4998,"['Well', 'time', 'again', 'time', 'damn', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'movie', 'sarcastic', 'celebration', 'release', '4th', 'Christ', 'almighty', '4th', 'movies', 'thought', ""'d"", 'revisit', 'one', 'started', 'film', 'much', 'saw', 'movies', 'somehow', 'launched', 'franchise', 'simultaneously', 'helping', 'one', 'career', 'how', 'hell', 'happen', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'sure', 'now', 'everyone', 'basic', 'premise', 'couple', 'young', 'professionals', 'are', 'being', 'haunted', 'hunted', 'nameless', 'demon', 'thing', 'boyfriend', 'fancy', 'camera', 'bring', 'audience', 'ride', 'peek', 'events', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'please-just-get-help-already', 'becoming', 'well-worn', 'formula', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'managed', 'little', 'bit', 'movie', 'magic', 'sitting', 'weird', 'cross', 'section', 'right', 'time/right', 'place', 'memorable', 'gimmick', 'excellent', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'success', 'face', 'mixed', 'audience', 'reactions.The', 'polarizing', 'nature', 'film', 'love-hate', 'reactions', 'are', 'what', 'want', 'talk', 'most', 'overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'pretty', 'quality', 'low', 'budget', 'production', 'seriously', 'pacing', 'good', 'story', 'simple', 'danger', 'stakes', 'appropriate', 'times', 'What', 'few', 'effects', 'are', 'used', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'simple', 'flawless', 'never', 'see', 'strings', 'magician', 'hands', 'work', 'get', 'very', 'solid', 'honest', 'performance', 'Katie', 'Featherston', 'demon', 'haunting', 'presence', 'feels', 'well', 'developed', 'Even', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'get', 'impression', 'personality', 'maybe', 'look', 'writer', 'could', 'describe', 'tactics', 'kind', 'make', 'sense', 'creepy', 'wife-beating', 'eternal', 'spirit', 'sort', 'way', 'So', 'yeah', 'bones', 'well', 'done', 'production', 'are', 'there', 'key', 'love', 'hate', 'not', 'give', 'damn.I', 'seriously', 'rests', 'not', 'develop', 'empathy', 'characters', 'situation', 'not', 'can', 'project', 'Not', 'SYMPATHY', 'mind', ""n't"", 'matter', 'not', 'people', 'empathy', 'not', 'can', 'see', 'shoes', 'said', 'story', 'incredibly', 'simplistic', 'couple', 'almost', 'nothing', 'better', 'situation', 'almost', 'real', 'struggle', 'antagonist', 'could', 'argue', '90', 'minutes', 'people', 'reacting', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'simple', 'moving', 'doors', 'moving', 'shadows', 'bits', 'noise', 'Compare', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Drag', 'Me', 'Hell', 'example', 'traditionally', 'told', 'story', 'ton', 'conflict', 'ton', 'struggle', 'lots', 'loud', 'things', 'thrown', 'camera', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'practically', ""'slice"", 'life', 'movie', 'when', 'compared', 'something', 'that.BUT', 'get', 'sucked', 'did', 'fact', 'things', 'happening', 'are', 'so', 'small', 'becomes', 'terrifying', 'things', 'were', 'happening', 'ME', 'lights', 'were', 'going', 'could', 'see', 'demon', 'breath', 'girlfriend', 'should', ""'d"", 'about', 'lose', 'mind', 'movie', 'got', 'imagination', 'once', ""'ve"", 'put', 'house', 'boyfriend', 'life', 'masterpiece', 'pacing', 'atmosphere', 'home', 'place', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'safe', 'now', 'corrupted', 'dangerous', 'creepy', 'rapey', 'little', 'demon', 'little', 'thing', 'light', 'switch', 'tv', 'bed', 'danger', 'Nowhere', 'safe', 'movie', 'mind', 'when', ""'m"", 'watching', 'little', 'thing', 'home', 'becomes', 'suspect', 'clicks', 'heater', 'set', 'rattle', 'pipe', 'jump', 'little', 'things', 'little', 'creaks', 'groans', 'mean', 'SOMETHING', 'IS', 'WATCHING', 'YOU', 'problem', 'hinges', 'one', 'thing', 'grabbing', 'audience', 'empathy', ""n't"", 'happen', 'movie', 'fault', 'not', 'quite', 'boring', 'real', 'story', 'real', 'effects', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Just', 'two', 'people', 'living', 'particularly', 'awful', 'period', 'lives', 'Chekhovian', 'ghost', 'story', '.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'talk', 'ending', 'are', 'three', 'DVD', 'think', 'even', 'more', 'YouTube', 'so', 'pick', 'favorite', 'go', 'went', 'least', 'nihilistic', 'one', 'theatrical', 'release', 'was', 'smartest', 'thing', 'do', 'marketing', 'perspective', 'Audiences', 'hate', 'nihilistic', 'endings', 'just', 'how', 'everyone', 'dead', 'harder', 'make', 'sequels', 'could', 'argue', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ending', 'ultimately', 'picked', 'one', 'last', 'big', 'jump', 'scare', 'particular', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'house', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'level', 'just', 'fine', 'me.All', 'said', 'have', 'say', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'one', 'favorite', 'scary', 'movies', 'personal', 'choice', 'movie', 'right', 'buttons', 'none', 'wrong', 'ones', 'subtle', 'subdued', 'still', 'being', 'imaginative', 'honest', 'days', 'something', 'special', 'indeed.BOO']",N/A

The Haunting (original 1963 version) is one of my favorites. A movie can be scary or creepy without excessive use of computer generated imagery. In fact, personally, the more complicated the special effects are, the more contrived they appear and lose some degree of realism. After many a strike-outs in my search, I was pretty happy with this one. I think a person's satisfaction has more to do with their expectations of it. If you don't expect anything as a general rule, you're bound to be happier with a film.That said, this one does not use a bunch of heavy-handed special effects, so if you need that, you won't be happy. I will say it is certainly not for everyone. Some people just don't like that type of horror movie.

The film isn't gory or violent, I don't think there's a drop of blood in it, and it just goes to show that horror and violence don't need to be synonymous.The story itself is very simple too, if you look at the cover and the title you pretty much know what to expect, however I really liked the whole style of it, the husband's a camera nut who wants to film everything and this is part of the brilliance of the film's technique. There will be long uneventful shots where nothing is going on yet the audience is holding their breath waiting for something to move, maybe out the corner of their eye. Subtelty and patience are key here, Alfred Hitchcock would be proud.Other scares are very well set up, the wife standing abover her husband for hours still sends chills down my spine, and the priest walking in the house for one second then immediately turning on his heels was pretty creepy as well; all without a drop of blood. However the ending I watched (in theaters) was pretty disappointing, *spoilers* the guy leaves the room, then gets thrown into the camera for a jump scare, then the wife looks into the camera lens and tries to bite it or something. That was a bit anti-climactic and I would've given the movie 3 stars had I not seen the original ending. If you haven't seen it basically the producers realized they could make a franchise out of Paranormal Activity(they were right) so they altered the original ending into some vague jump scare so they could set up the sequels instead of sticking with the far creepier original.I'm probably wasting my time reviewing this, people already know the series and whether or not they like it, however I really like Paranormal Activity (the 1st one) because it shows that American horror that doesn't resort to blood and guts is still around.",4,Great Modern Chiller,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,2042,"['Paranormal', 'Activity', 'now', 'bit', 'Saw', 'starting', 'pump', 'out', 'sequels', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'original', 'however', 'do', 'series', 'lot', 'better', 'Saw', 'back', 'better', 'days', 'horror', 'a-la', 'Changeling', 'film', ""n't"", 'gory', 'violent', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'drop', 'blood', 'just', 'show', 'horror', 'violence', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'synonymous.The', 'story', 'very', 'simple', 'too', 'look', 'cover', 'title', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'however', 'really', 'liked', 'whole', 'style', 'husband', 'camera', 'nut', 'who', 'film', 'everything', 'part', 'brilliance', 'film', 'technique', 'will', 'be', 'long', 'uneventful', 'shots', 'where', 'nothing', 'going', 'yet', 'audience', 'holding', 'breath', 'waiting', 'something', 'move', 'maybe', 'corner', 'eye', 'Subtelty', 'patience', 'are', 'key', 'here', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'would', 'be', 'proud.Other', 'scares', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'set', 'up', 'wife', 'standing', 'abover', 'husband', 'hours', 'still', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'priest', 'walking', 'house', 'one', 'second', 'then', 'immediately', 'turning', 'heels', 'was', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'well', 'drop', 'blood', 'However', 'ending', 'watched', 'theaters', 'was', 'pretty', 'disappointing', '*spoilers*', 'guy', 'room', 'then', 'thrown', 'camera', 'jump', 'scare', 'then', 'wife', 'camera', 'tries', 'bite', 'something', 'was', 'bit', 'anti-climactic', 'would', ""'ve"", 'given', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'ending', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'basically', 'producers', 'realized', 'could', 'make', 'franchise', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'were', 'right', 'altered', 'original', 'ending', 'vague', 'jump', 'scare', 'could', 'set', 'up', 'sequels', 'instead', 'sticking', 'far', 'creepier', 'original.I', ""'m"", 'probably', 'wasting', 'time', 'reviewing', 'people', 'already', 'know', 'series', 'not', 'however', 'really', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '1st', 'one', 'American', 'horror', ""n't"", 'resort', 'blood', 'guts', 'still', 'around']",N/A

1293685,AGP0LMEHFQITC,B002VKE0XA,"James Lucas Chatfield ""Religion: musician""","[3, 5]","I really enjoyed this movie.  I saw it three or four times while it was in theaters.  On first viewing, I immediately realized that this movie would have a completely polarized response, and it did.  Everyone who saw it was either completely creeped-out and liked it, or they were bored senseless and hated it.  My advice is to read Roger Ebert's review.  He really nailed this movie's appeal.  You can judge for yourself whether you'll like it or not just by what he had to say about it.This is not the kind of horror film that's been coming out over the last ten years or so.  It is not gory.  It is a very subtle meditation on the sort of things that scare us when we're alone in the dark and our imaginations get the better of us.  There is no background score, only a deep, sustained rumble that ominously creeps in when the ""activity"" is present.Everyone knows the plot by now.  A young, suburban couple has decided to film their lives in an attempt to prove/disprove and eventually deal with paranormal disturbances they have been encountering since moving in together.  The activity is most... well, active...  at night.  The camera is left on while the couple sleeps, and captures mild activity such as doors moving on their own and the sounds of what could only be footsteps.  I won't tell anything beyond that, but suffice it say that if you are willing to let yourself into the feel of this movie, it can be a fun and truly scary experience.  If you're waiting for something shockingly horrific to take place, stick with Saw sequels.Now, onto the actual Blu-Ray...I gotta admit, I was happy to own this movie, but I was kinda let down by the lack of special features.  The only thing on here other than the movie itself is an ""alternate"" version which is completely identical until the last scene of the movie.  The alternate ending is also available on it's own, so the need for two whole versions of the film seems extraneous.  No commentary, no deleted scenes, no interviews, no nothing.  The story of how this movie came to be released is actually very interesting, especially the involvement of Steven Speilberg.  There is even another ending (the original one) that could have been added.  Why did Paramount leave so much off of the release of one of the most talked-about movies of the year?

1293687,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B002VKE0XA,James Morris,"[293, 344]","A well-written review of any film should never label its subject ""good"" or ""bad"".  Rather, it should give you an idea of whether or not you can expect to enjoy it, based on your own preferences and expectations.  Paranormal Activity is a particularly controversial film when it comes to the potency of its terror.  Most reviews either complain, with great disdain, ""I hated it - it wasn't scary at all"" or exclaim in total satisfaction, ""It scared the pants off me - I loved it"".  There seems to be little in-between.I saw the film today, having read enough reviews to know pretty much what to expect.  But before I reveal my own reaction to Paranormal Activity, I would like to offer a few ideas that those who know little about this film may find helpful.Alfred Hitchcock, the celebrated director who was known as ""The Master of Suspense"" held many interesting theories about what frightens an audience.  Hitchcock believed that, when properly stimulated, the viewer's imagination was far more powerful - and far scarier - than many direct images that may or may not frighten the average viewer.  Directly depicting a ghost, a monster or a demon for example, even with today's special effects, may scare many viewers, but that will depend solely on the quality of the effects.  And even if well done, many viewers may find the images unconvincing or downright laughable, for they may have other ideas about what a ghost, monster or demon should look like.However, if the filmmaker merely implies that a supernatural event is taking place, and sets up the situation with enough skill, the viewer's imagination can take over and sometimes yield a far more frightening experience than any vivid imagery ever will.  After all, people go to horror films to be frightened, and what could be more frightening than unseen terrors from one's own imagination?  By setting the mood with dark rooms, low lighting, eerie shadows and other effects that many people will associate with their greatest fears, an innocent image of two people peacefully sleeping, unaware of what may be going on about them or to them, can become very frightening indeed, even if few special effects are used.  This is especially true if the moviegoer has developed enough empathy with the characters to place themselves in the same situation.Many modern horror films rely on blood, gore and violence, with horrible creatures conjured up by special effects and vivid scenes involving battles with ugly demons or manic killers in order to provide thrills.  That can be a lot of fun, and certainly very scary.  But it can also be argued that, as CGI effects advance and become more vivid and frighteningly realistic, many viewers become inured to violence, blood and ""creatures"" while depending less and less on their own imagination, and in the process, they will sometimes forgo a far scarier experience.  I know that no special effect ever came close to my own nightmares, because my nightmares are stirred by the things I fear most, and not the things that I've been conditioned to find scary.  In short, no amount of vivid terrors can match the human imagination, provided that the imagination is properly stimulated.Well, this is the basic idea behind Paranormal Activity.  Largely on a shoestring budget, the writers/director/actors of Paranormal Activity have managed to create an old-fashioned thriller that relies almost exclusively on the viewer's imagination.  Those who like their ""scary movies"" full of CGI, monsters, blood and violence are warned; you will probably be extremely disappointed.  But if you have enough respect for your own imagination, and can allow yourself to be frightened not by what you see, but by what you think is there, you just may find Paranormal Activity to be every bit as frightening and well done as many people say it is.By the way, I saw it with a friend.  He did not find it frightening at all.  On the other hand, I definitely expect to have trouble sleeping tonight.  Whether or not you will agree may depend on how effective your own imagination can be.Recommended.",4,Be Prepared To Use Your Imagination,1259193600,"11 26, 2009",2009,4081,"['well-written', 'review', 'film', 'should', 'never', 'label', 'subject', 'good', 'bad', 'Rather', 'should', 'give', 'idea', 'not', 'can', 'expect', 'enjoy', 'based', 'own', 'preferences', 'expectations', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'particularly', 'controversial', 'film', 'when', 'potency', 'terror', 'Most', 'reviews', 'complain', 'great', 'disdain', 'hated', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'exclaim', 'total', 'satisfaction', 'scared', 'pants', 'loved', 'be', 'little', 'in-between.I', 'saw', 'film', 'today', 'having', 'read', 'enough', 'reviews', 'know', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'expect', 'reveal', 'own', 'reaction', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'would', 'like', 'offer', 'few', 'ideas', 'who', 'know', 'little', 'film', 'may', 'find', 'helpful.Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'celebrated', 'director', 'who', 'was', 'known', 'Master', 'Suspense', 'held', 'many', 'interesting', 'theories', 'what', 'audience', 'Hitchcock', 'believed', 'when', 'properly', 'stimulated', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'far', 'scarier', 'many', 'direct', 'images', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'frighten', 'average', 'viewer', 'Directly', 'depicting', 'ghost', 'monster', 'demon', 'example', 'even', 'today', 'special', 'effects', 'may', 'scare', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'depend', 'solely', 'quality', 'effects', 'even', 'well', 'done', 'many', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'images', 'unconvincing', 'downright', 'laughable', 'may', 'have', 'other', 'ideas', 'what', 'ghost', 'monster', 'demon', 'should', 'look', 'like.However', 'filmmaker', 'merely', 'supernatural', 'event', 'taking', 'place', 'up', 'situation', 'enough', 'skill', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'can', 'take', 'over', 'sometimes', 'yield', 'far', 'more', 'frightening', 'experience', 'vivid', 'imagery', 'ever', 'will', 'people', 'go', 'horror', 'films', 'be', 'frightened', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'frightening', 'unseen', 'terrors', 'one', 'own', 'imagination', 'setting', 'mood', 'dark', 'rooms', 'low', 'lighting', 'eerie', 'shadows', 'other', 'effects', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'associate', 'greatest', 'fears', 'innocent', 'image', 'two', 'people', 'peacefully', 'sleeping', 'unaware', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'going', 'can', 'become', 'very', 'frightening', 'indeed', 'even', 'few', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'used', 'especially', 'true', 'moviegoer', 'developed', 'enough', 'empathy', 'characters', 'place', 'same', 'situation.Many', 'modern', 'horror', 'films', 'rely', 'blood', 'gore', 'violence', 'horrible', 'creatures', 'conjured', 'up', 'special', 'effects', 'vivid', 'scenes', 'involving', 'battles', 'ugly', 'demons', 'manic', 'killers', 'order', 'provide', 'thrills', 'can', 'be', 'lot', 'fun', 'certainly', 'very', 'scary', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'argued', 'that', 'CGI', 'effects', 'advance', 'become', 'more', 'vivid', 'frighteningly', 'realistic', 'many', 'viewers', 'become', 'inured', 'violence', 'blood', 'creatures', 'depending', 'less', 'less', 'own', 'imagination', 'process', 'will', 'sometimes', 'forgo', 'far', 'scarier', 'experience', 'know', 'special', 'effect', 'ever', 'came', 'close', 'own', 'nightmares', 'nightmares', 'are', 'stirred', 'things', 'fear', 'most', 'not', 'things', ""'ve"", 'been', 'conditioned', 'find', 'scary', 'short', 'amount', 'vivid', 'terrors', 'can', 'match', 'human', 'imagination', 'provided', 'imagination', 'properly', 'stimulated.Well', 'basic', 'idea', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Largely', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'writers/director/actors', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'have', 'managed', 'create', 'old-fashioned', 'thriller', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'who', 'like', 'scary', 'movies', 'full', 'CGI', 'monsters', 'blood', 'violence', 'are', 'warned', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'have', 'enough', 'respect', 'own', 'imagination', 'can', 'allow', 'be', 'frightened', 'not', 'what', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'there', 'just', 'may', 'find', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'be', 'bit', 'frightening', 'well', 'done', 'many', 'people', 'say', 'way', 'saw', 'friend', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'frightening', 'other', 'hand', 'definitely', 'expect', 'have', 'trouble', 'sleeping', 'tonight', 'not', 'will', 'agree', 'may', 'depend', 'how', 'effective', 'own', 'imagination', 'can', 'be.Recommended']",N/A

1293690,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B002VKE0XA,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[23, 34]","Low budget indie films have been a good way for amateur filmmakers to break out for a long time. Kevin Smith broke out with a black and white movie made for $67,000 called Clerks; El Mariachi, made for only $7,000, turned Robert Rodriguez into a big name rebel director in the 90's. Horror is a harder medium to make it in the low budget arena. A field dominated by gory and effects driven movies these days, horror saw a megahit in 1999's Blair Witch Project. Made for only $11,000, Blair Witch Project has often been duplicated, but the success was never repeated. Here we are, 10 years later, and a new phenomenon has come around with Paranormal Activity, a movie that doesn't try to be Blair Witch, but exceeds expectations. Made also for only $11,000, Paranormal Activity has made a huge splash in the mainstream breaking records in the process (in it's first weekend it broke $7 million in only 200 theaters), but is it really worth all the fuss?After a series of ""supernatural"" events have happened in their house, Micah, decides to get a video camera to substantiate their claims of a haunting. Katie (who's engaged to be engaged to Micah) has had these supernatural events happen to her since she was 8, she wants them to stop, and while she's not entirely comfortable with Micah recording the events, she goes along with it. They meet with a psychic who feels they're dealing with a demon and suggests a demonologist to help them take care of their problem. Micah doesn't take it seriously, and believes they can get rid of their visitor without outside help. Despite Katie's warnings and worry, Micah keeps trying to provoke the entity. Tensions build, tempers flare, and the paranormal activity gets more intense till it finally reaches the breaking point.Originally bought by Paramount with the intention of owning the rights to remake the movie with a better budget and bigger names, Paranormal Activity fares better without the higher production values of a big budget film. Shot with one handheld camera and without a score, the movie feels completely real. The use of unknown actors also gives the film a more authentic feel, and it helps that they don't really feel like they're acting as well. As each day unfolds, we find ourselves prisoners in the house, which adds to the claustrophobic feel of the movie. We learn every nook and cranny of the house, so we notice the moving shadows, and the changes that occur all the more later on in the film.All in all, Paranormal Activity is a very well done horror film, stripping away many of the conventions we see in horror film, relying on real scares rather than gore or music cues to instill a sense of tension and fear in the audience. I highly recommend seeing this in theaters if you have the opportunity, the atmosphere of seeing this with others really helps with adding fear to the proceedings as large groups intensify the feeling among those in the group. For those of you planning on taking the children, there is foul language, but on top of that the film does start off slowly and the more nuanced scenes may be lost on a younger audience.

1293691,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B002VKE0XA,Jason,"[2, 3]","Some viewers want a Michael Bay-style sucker punch to the senses, a film delivered so obtusely that interpretation becomes nearly meaningless.  Like a roller coaster, it's just about the ride.  Others prefer the intellectual or psychological, a tale that slowly develops and allows viewer imagination to dictate not only what is transpiring, but also whether or not the content is, indeed, frightening.  Given the fact Paranormal Activity falls into the latter category, I'm somewhat surprised by its relative success.Rather than taking a step ahead, PA takes a sidestep with the handheld camera concept made popular by Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield.  Avoiding too much of the rapid movements sure to induce epilepsy and migraines, PA provides a terrifying tale of a couple's cursed home.  The majority of the film is Micah talking into the video camera about a demon freeloading in the house while his girlfriend Katie self-loathingly impersonates every bad Cathy comic ever puked onto newspaper.  The only worthwhile parts are the sleeping scenes for two reasons:1)  When they are scary, they allow the viewers to anticipate and work into frenzy.2)  When they are boring, they allow the viewer to catch a quick cat-nap while Katie acts paranoid.There are a few unnerving, slowly paced scenes shot while the couple slept that could substitute for the worst insomnia commercials ever or the best advertisement for single beds in adjoining rooms in history.  Overall, however, it's just an Ouija Board clich&eacute;, which is to say that there is more meat in the marketing than on the bone.Jason Elin",3,Paranoid Activity,1268438400,"03 13, 2010",2010,1606,"['viewers', 'want', 'Michael', 'Bay-style', 'sucker', 'punch', 'senses', 'film', 'delivered', 'so', 'obtusely', 'interpretation', 'nearly', 'meaningless', 'roller', 'coaster', 'just', 'ride', 'Others', 'prefer', 'intellectual', 'psychological', 'tale', 'slowly', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'dictate', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'transpiring', 'also', 'not', 'content', 'indeed', 'frightening', 'Given', 'fact', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'latter', 'category', ""'m"", 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'relative', 'success.Rather', 'taking', 'step', 'ahead', 'PA', 'sidestep', 'handheld', 'camera', 'concept', 'made', 'popular', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Cloverfield', 'Avoiding', 'too', 'much', 'rapid', 'movements', 'sure', 'induce', 'epilepsy', 'migraines', 'PA', 'terrifying', 'tale', 'couple', 'cursed', 'home', 'majority', 'film', 'Micah', 'talking', 'video', 'camera', 'demon', 'freeloading', 'house', 'girlfriend', 'Katie', 'self-loathingly', 'bad', 'Cathy', 'comic', 'ever', 'puked', 'newspaper', 'only', 'worthwhile', 'parts', 'are', 'sleeping', 'scenes', 'two', 'reasons:1', 'When', 'are', 'scary', 'allow', 'viewers', 'anticipate', 'work', 'frenzy.2', 'When', 'are', 'boring', 'allow', 'viewer', 'catch', 'quick', 'cat-nap', 'Katie', 'acts', 'paranoid.There', 'are', 'few', 'unnerving', 'slowly', 'paced', 'scenes', 'shot', 'couple', 'slept', 'could', 'substitute', 'worst', 'insomnia', 'commercials', 'ever', 'best', 'advertisement', 'single', 'beds', 'adjoining', 'rooms', 'history', 'Overall', 'however', 'just', 'Ouija', 'Board', 'clich', 'eacute', 'say', 'more', 'meat', 'marketing', 'bone.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A
1293692,A34ZY8SF7XYSZS,B002VKE0XA,"Jason T. Fetters ""Horror Fanboy & Japanologist""","[2, 5]","Paranormal Activity is the perfect example of a film that is shown during Halloween and after its run, no one will remember it. A movie that doesn't stick with you and if you make the effort to go see it, then its just another way to spend Saturday evening.There is nothing special about Paranormal Activity, you have your stupid stock horror character in Micah, played by Micah Sloat, who buys a camera to record strange events occuring at home.  Micah's use of filming his girlfriend Katie, played by Katie Featherston, by annoyingly having the camera right up in her face like an old MTV concert video, gets old quickly. Katie has a lot of patience to put up with be constantly filmed during such mundane activties such as brushing her teeth.  I never understood why Katie didn't punch Micah in the arm and turn off that damn camera.Anyway, the camera is placed in the bedroom to record what happens each night. As can be expected in this type of film, doors shut by themselves, windows lock, lights turn on, footsteps are heard, and strange sounds occur. All elements of any haunted house movie. If you have ever seen one haunted house movie, then you are not really seeing anything different here. Nothing that adds to the genre.A better example of a psychological, character driven Haunted House movie would be Robert Wise's The Haunting (1963) which does cause sleepless nights unlike Paranormal Activity.This movie had a lot of potential to be entertaining or better, actually scary, but it just never gets there like the rollar coaster ride that starts out strong and fizzle out at the end.The hauntings are caused by a demon who follows Katie from place to place and not a ghost bound to one location.  The whimpy psychic, Michael B&uuml;nyamin, makes this point when he shows up to find out why Micah and Katie are being haunted. He claims that he is not a demonologist so he can't really do anything. He's just a character giving information and he's not really effective combating the supernatural because its not really his job. Katie and Micah argue about calling a demonolgist to try to put a stop to demon activites and the demonologist never shows up.That's my main problem with Paranormal Activites, there is no expert sent it to combat and fight the demon. This movie needs a Van Helsing or an Priest trained in exorcism to step in and actually do something about the problem.Micah's lame attempts to fill that position through self education from demonology books and Internet information and trying to confront the demon through talking to it and shouting go nowhere. Micah never tries anything to battle the demon like holy water or any idea that might work. The demon has all the power and does whatever it wants to with Micah and Katie.  There is no specialist who does anything to try to stop it or information presented in the film to aid fighting the demon and forcing it to stop haunting the couple.I won't spoil the ending, I will just say it was the best part of the whole drawn out experience and it probably caused the terrorfied high school kid, sitting in front of me, to wet himself. I haven't seen an auidence member jump like that in a long time.If you have $9 to spend and you want to see something good with intelligent characters this Halloween, then go see Zombieland instead of Paranoraml Activity.I really wish directors working today, would go back and research good horror movies that work and go see horror movies made in the 80's when these films actually worked and were made better.2 and 1/2 stars Average fare.",3,Average Haunting Fare,1255824000,"10 18, 2009",2009,3561,"['Paranormal', 'Activity', 'perfect', 'example', 'film', 'shown', 'Halloween', 'run', 'one', 'will', 'remember', 'movie', ""n't"", 'stick', 'make', 'effort', 'go', 'see', 'then', 'just', 'way', 'spend', 'Saturday', 'nothing', 'special', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'have', 'stupid', 'stock', 'horror', 'character', 'Micah', 'played', 'Micah', 'Sloat', 'who', 'camera', 'record', 'strange', 'events', 'occuring', 'home', 'Micah', 'use', 'filming', 'girlfriend', 'Katie', 'played', 'Katie', 'Featherston', 'annoyingly', 'having', 'camera', 'right', 'up', 'face', 'old', 'MTV', 'concert', 'video', 'old', 'quickly', 'Katie', 'lot', 'patience', 'put', 'up', 'be', 'constantly', 'filmed', 'such', 'mundane', 'activties', 'such', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'Katie', 'did', ""n't"", 'punch', 'Micah', 'arm', 'turn', 'off', 'damn', 'camera.Anyway', 'camera', 'placed', 'bedroom', 'record', 'what', 'night', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'type', 'film', 'doors', 'shut', 'lock', 'lights', 'turn', 'footsteps', 'are', 'heard', 'strange', 'sounds', 'occur', 'elements', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'then', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'seeing', 'anything', 'different', 'here', 'Nothing', 'genre.A', 'better', 'example', 'psychological', 'character', 'driven', 'Haunted', 'House', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'Haunting', '1963', 'cause', 'sleepless', 'nights', 'Paranormal', 'Activity.This', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'be', 'entertaining', 'better', 'actually', 'scary', 'just', 'never', 'rollar', 'coaster', 'ride', 'out', 'strong', 'fizzle', 'out', 'end.The', 'hauntings', 'are', 'caused', 'demon', 'who', 'Katie', 'place', 'place', 'not', 'ghost', 'bound', 'one', 'location', 'whimpy', 'psychic', 'Michael', 'B', 'uuml', 'point', 'when', 'up', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Micah', 'Katie', 'are', 'being', 'haunted', 'not', 'demonologist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'just', 'character', 'giving', 'information', 'not', 'really', 'effective', 'combating', 'supernatural', 'not', 'really', 'job', 'Katie', 'Micah', 'argue', 'calling', 'demonolgist', 'try', 'put', 'stop', 'demon', 'activites', 'demonologist', 'never', 'main', 'problem', 'Paranormal', 'Activites', 'expert', 'sent', 'combat', 'fight', 'demon', 'movie', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'Priest', 'trained', 'exorcism', 'step', 'actually', 'do', 'something', 'problem.Micah', 'lame', 'fill', 'position', 'self', 'education', 'demonology', 'books', 'Internet', 'information', 'trying', 'confront', 'demon', 'talking', 'shouting', 'go', 'nowhere', 'Micah', 'never', 'anything', 'battle', 'demon', 'holy', 'water', 'idea', 'might', 'work', 'demon', 'power', 'whatever', 'Micah', 'Katie', 'specialist', 'who', 'anything', 'try', 'stop', 'information', 'presented', 'film', 'aid', 'fighting', 'demon', 'forcing', 'stop', 'haunting', 'couple.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ending', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'whole', 'drawn', 'experience', 'probably', 'caused', 'terrorfied', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'sitting', 'front', 'wet', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'auidence', 'member', 'jump', 'long', 'time.If', 'have', '9', 'spend', 'want', 'see', 'something', 'good', 'intelligent', 'characters', 'Halloween', 'then', 'go', 'see', 'Zombieland', 'instead', 'Paranoraml', 'Activity.I', 'really', 'wish', 'directors', 'working', 'today', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'research', 'good', 'horror', 'movies', 'work', 'go', 'see', 'horror', 'movies', 'made', '80', 'when', 'films', 'actually', 'worked', 'were', 'made', 'better.2', '1/2', 'stars', 'Average', 'fare']",N/A

This is it in a nutshell, ""Night 1"", they toss and turn, a slight noise, next day Katie whines and Micah checks it out on his computer, tapes Katie in the bathroom. ""Night 3"", toss and turn, bedroom door moves back and forth, next day Katie whines some more about being scared, Micah gets into it, tapes her some more in the bathroom. ""Night 6"" toss and turning, loud thump, Katie calls a psychic and he stops by and does nothing, and so on and so forth. LOL! Sorry, that may not be exactly it but...I will admit that I did enjoy the very end, you can skip the alternate ending, but up until that point I just didn't believe any of it or the characters. It's a shame because I really was looking forward to it.I'd like to congratulate the marketing folks who did an amazing job with this film, creating all kinds of buzz and hype and sucking almost everyone in the world to go see this film and/or buy the DVD. I must say I am the latter and boy was I duped! I have to say maybe I'm just a ""doubting Thomas"" but I don't go for all the ""ghost hunter"" tv reality shows and the like and when I heard the premise of this I just couldn't pull myself to go to the theater and see it. In any event I kept reading, not in great detail as to spoil any expectations, review after review praising and saying how scary this was, much to my dismay.One reviewer said, "" Paranormal Activity is the most raw horror film since the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre. It's very realistic and unsettling."" But then in the same breath goes on to say ""The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the stupid characters"", how can you have a movie that is both realistic and has stupid characters? You got me, I thought the characters were very unrealistic most notably, which no one seems to mention, the visiting ""psychic"" played by Mark Fredrichs. His dialogue was horrible and stiff and was so completely bad that it shot was credibility it had right out the window. At some points Micah was pretty unbelievable too when he is yelling out to the spirit, and the whole cliche using the Ouija Board was almost laughable. On top of all this as the story unfolds, I won't give it away, but it just became more increasingly lame, ie the story on the computer and the past. Come on, you tell me you really got into that?Anyway, I could really go on and on but I won't. Like I said from the start, maybe I'm too much of a ""doubting Thomas"" or just don't jump on the ""bandwagon"" like most, I don't know, I do know this was NOT the most scariest movie ever nor should it be compared to some of the great classics! And I slept like a baby that night. Oh, I almost forgot, I did get my name in the credits! LOL! I wish I hadn't now that I know how bad it was. I've also put my copy up for sale on Amazon.

1293695,A1AQBOWEL8TROJ,B002VKE0XA,Jean-ren Leroux,"[2, 7]","Those of you who ""weren't"" scared, it sure feels like you're just trying to show off and laugh it up so that you can make your fightened soul feel better. Watch it again alone (so that you won't feel obligated to laugh in order to show that you're brave) and watch it at night and try to go sleep... alone and with no lights on. While you're trying to sleep, think of the scene where the sheets are moving by themselves... or try to sleep with your leg hanging over the edge of the bed... I know the bravest man on Earth will be scared. Even just a little. Heck! I'm brave. I'm not easily scared. I'm not afarid of the dark. Yet, i do think of the movie from time to time when i close the lights. OK, i think of it with a smile cause to feel a bit uneasy is kind of silly but still, i think of it.You liars.I'm not talking about the movie itself. I can understand that some of you didn't like the structure, the acting, the point of view or whatever. But what it was suggesting... if it didn't even make you feel a bit uneasy, well i simply don't believe you. It's my choice and i stand by it. If you're not a little bit scared by it, you're lying. A little, i'm saying. Not a lot. Not trembling. Just a bit uneasy. Even if you don't believe in that kind of stuff... which i don't. But we all have imagination.""Serious"" movies about ghosts or demons always have a different effect on me than any other horror movies as they deal with something you can't really explain. I'm not talking about ""Constantine"" or something deliberately overblown here...No hollywood-type special effects, no gore or monsters, no music. Everything is made to look normal, amateur-style and very, very minimalist. The authors have the brilliance to protect themselves by making one character (the boyfriend) a bit resistant to what's going on. Like most of us, he doesn't necessarily believe what's happening. Like all men, he wants to show to his girlfriend that he is in charge. That he isn't scared. So by the time he doesn't have a choice but to actually BELIEVE, we, as a spectator, also believe. For the time of the movie, of course. After it's over, we know it was just a story but while it lasted, we agreed to believe it. That's the whole point of cinema: to make you believe while the movie last. AFter, you discuss it.Also, the film make it a point to warn us that the house is not at fault here. It's the girl. Wherever she goes, the entity WILL follow. She just has to deal with it. It doesn't matter if she always sleeps on the same side of the bed, beside the door or not. It doesn't even matter if that darn door is closed or not. IT will come after her. It will possess her! So this argument of putting the movie down because she never changes her position in the bed or because they never leave the damn house is not valid. It will follow her wherever she goes. And the boyfriend will ALWAYS be seen as an enemy.The film deals with little things that are sure to scare us. Strange noises, afraid to sleep with one arm or one leg hanging over the edge of the bed, surreal shadows, an object misplaced, the sensation of being watched, invisible footsteps, strange footprints, etc... The filmmakers let our imagination do the rest. Even Spielberg agreed to that when he wrote ""Poltergeist"" even if his movie was a lot more special effect oriented. The little things, he said, are what scare us the most.The end may be a bit overblowned but at this point, the desired effect is successfully integrated in our soul. We are scared stiff! And it will leave a mark...The alternate ending is more ""believable"" but makes you wonder why would the entity do all this, for all those years, simply to do what it does at the end.I would have loved for the movie to keep on going and see actual professionals take care of the girl. A bit like ""The Entity"". It would have been the natural path, i suppose. But that wasn't the idea here. Things happen too fast and one expert has left them alone has they are waiting for another one to show up.Gee-whees, just having the girl get up and stand rigid over the bed, watching her boyfriend sleep for hours, is enough to get your blood going. At the end, when the entity actually becomes physical, it becomes a lesson to all filmmakers on how to genuinely scare an audience. Just like the first ""Blair Witch Project"".Very good movie. Very frightening. The kind of movie you can dare a friend to watch. But that friend has to watch it ALONE, AT NIGHT, IN THE DARK and WITHOUT ANY INTERUPTIONS. Or else, the desired effect is lost. Like ""Blair Witch #1"", watch it with someone else and you won't be scared as much. Leave the light on or talk or get up to do something else while the movie is still playing and you've wasted the whole point of watching it. Cause the sacry parts are in the little details and the general athmosphere.After that, if that friend tells me that he wasn't scared, i'll know that he's lying and that's just his or her way to feel brave.I'm saying all of this with a smile of course. Everybody has their own opinion. I simply have serious doubts over those who play brave or jaded about it.",4,You are all liars!,1266192000,"02 15, 2010",2010,5135,"['who', 'were', ""n't"", 'scared', 'sure', 'feels', ""'re"", 'just',

This movie relies on psychological, unseen terror to frighten the viewer, and the movie succeeds very well at this.As for the story, couple Katie and Micah have recently moved in together.  However, there's one little secret Katie forgot to tell him; she's being haunted by an unseen demonic force that gives her terrible nightmares...and worse. During the approximate three-week time period covered in the movie, the presence constantly harasses the couple.  At first, the occurrences are minor, but as the movie goes on, they become much more frightening.  Soon, doors begin slamming for no reason, lights start flickering on and off, and Katie is pulled out of the bed.  The couple enlists the help psychologists trained in hauntings and demonology, but their efforts fail to solve the problem.  As the movie reaches its climax, Katie and Micah face the full fury of the spirit.  Who will win?Following in the footsteps of such movies as ""The Blair With Project"" and ""Cloverfield"", ""Paranormal Activity"" scares its viewers with unseen psychological forces.  I was somewhat skeptical about how good this movie would be, but after watching it, I was truly scared.  I thought the producers did an excellent job of building the level of terror as the movie progressed.  The ending of the movie is truly frightening.  I do like horror movies with blood and guts, by the psychological terror found in ""Paranormal Activity"" is truly frightening.I give this movie my highest recommendation.

1293697,A22Q3DG4CHS4JA,B002VKE0XA,"Jelly Jar ""Granny""","[12, 17]","I saw this in the wonderful Moolah Theatre in beautiful downtown St. Louis, MO. To start with, the awesome speaker system there did nothing for the terrible sound quality of the movie. They may have wanted it to sound more like the filming was being done by a camcorder, but gritty muffling throughout did nothing but detract from the entire experience.Another reviewer alluded to this movie as having the type of appeal that would attract eight-year-olds or those with eight-year-old intelligence levels (using much more degrading words, of course.) I wouldn't necessarily agree with that notion. On the contrary, the eight-year-olds and teenagers were the ones who were LAUGHING in the theater. NOBODY screamed until the last ten seconds.The bore factor here was incredible. Time crawled by while two shallow characters, Micah and what's-her-name, dealt with a supernatural entity that was never seen. Hey, it's okay to not show the demon; I understand that that's supposed to be part of the fear factor, but saving the best part of the movie for the extreme end when it could have been introduced as a foundation early on and then built upon for additional scares was a HUGE golden opportunity missed by everyone involved. But that's not all as far as missed opportunities go...the whole thing with the psychic, or whatever that character was supposed to be, was flawed and underdeveloped. That individual situation could have been expanded upon to create a whole different angle and level to the movie.So why all the hype, you ask? I have two theories. It may be one or the other, but its most likely a combination of both:1. Exceptional marketing, whether deceiving or not! 'Nuff said.2. When horror is presented in such a way that it is less about the grandiose, over-the-top, literally unbelievable, Hollywood presentation like ""Poltergeist,"" for instance, and more about something that is so subtle that it could actually happen to ""YOU,"" it opens the door for personal fears to creep through and subject the subconscious to a taste of a not-impossible reality.That being said, I give the movie and its makers three stars for effort, but keep in mind viewers, MOST of this movie is VERY boring.Three Stars ***",3,"Don't believe the hype!

However, it did make quite a splash theatrically so I figured it was worth a watch.  I did not buy it, but I rented it from a Redbox.  I am buying it now just to watch with people that haven't seen it yet.  It isn't really the kind of movie you watch more than once because the best part of this movie is the suspense and not knowing what is coming.  I frequently buy movies to show to other people, not to watch over and over again alone.If you like to be scared, and you aren't so cerebral that you can't forget you are watching a movie, then you will really like this one.  I love scary movies.  I also love horror movies.  But I wouldn't really call this a horror movie (e.g. Texas Chainsaw Massacre).  It is more of a scary ghost story (e.g. The Sixth Sense).  Now don't jump all over me for comparing it to The Sixth Sense.  (It's good, but not that good).  I found the acting to be quite good.  The actors did a great job of seeming spontaneous and realistic.  The camera work is not as nauseating as Cloverfield or Blair With, but if that type of film bothers you than this one might also.This movie achieves its goal.  To scare you.  If you like the type of movie that makes you jump out of your seat than you won't be disappointed.  I'm embarassed to say this, but the night I watched it I freaked myself out so bad that I had to look under my bed and in the closet before I went to bed.  I know I'm a wimp.I think this is the kind of movie that people either hate it or love it.  It's been a while since I've seen a movie that really scared me.  And this movie definitely did that.

1293699,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B002VKE0XA,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[4, 8]","This is a really good film. Alfred Hitchcock did the same idea of ""Will people be more scared seeing the man holding the chainsaw, or will they be more scared HEARING the man with the chainsaw and never seeing him?"" I full out think that Paranormal Activity did this angle perfectly. The viewer is at the mercy of the camcorder; they hear things; sometimes soft, sometimes loud... they always hear movement, footsteps, breathing, pounding, etc (and sometimes see things that will shock you to the core) but never do you SEE it. And that is what makes this so frightening. You know the evil is there but you don't see it, just like normal real life haunting is usually.There's a slow build up of minor events happening, as they continue to grow in scope and weirdness, to the shocking ending. It had me and others jumping at certain points and so it definitely had its moments. The film is a lot like those cable reality shows where people go into reputed haunted houses and other places, flick on the night-vision camera, and end up scaring themselves half-silly.But the main difference between those shows (and even ""The Blair Witch Project"" movie) and PA is that ""PARANORMAL ACTIVITY"" actually shows you the strange and spooky stuff that's going on and it's not just the people suggesting it or showing dust specks and claiming that that's a spirit. You will see what's going on and it's pretty odd and frightening.Creating an amateur-ish like quality, most of the film is shot in a locked-off camera point-of-view, although there is a little shaking and swinging in the beginning and peppered throughout--not too much or long enough to cause motion sickness--only adds to the movie's mystique. Some shots are shot with the character's head only in partial view which lends to the idea that this is just a candidly shot home movie.Anyway, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is a fun and frightful film that's great to see with a packed audience and perfect for this Halloween season.",4,Simple things like this can turn so frightening.....,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,1970,"['really', 'good', 'film', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'did', 'same', 'idea', 'Will', 'people', 'be', 'more', 'scared', 'seeing', 'man', 'holding', 'chainsaw', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'scared', 'HEARING', 'man', 'chainsaw', 'never', 'seeing', 'full', 'out', 'think', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'did', 'angle', 'perfectly', 'viewer', 'mercy', 'camcorder', 'hear', 'things', 'sometimes', 'soft', 'sometimes', 'loud', 'always', 'hear', 'movement', 'footsteps', 'breathing', 'pounding', 'etc', 'sometimes', 'see', 'things', 'will', 'shock', 'core', 'never', 'do', 'SEE', 'what', 'so', 'frightening', 'know', 'evil', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'just', 'normal', 'real', 'life', 'haunting', 'slow', 'build', 'minor', 'events', 'happening', 'continue', 'grow', 'scope', 'weirdness', 'shocking', 'ending', 'had', 'others', 'jumping', 'certain', 'points', 'so', 'definitely', 'had', 'moments', 'film', 'lot', 'cable', 'reality', 'where', 'people', 'go', 'reputed', 'haunted', 'houses', 'other', 'places', 'flick', 'night-vision', 'camera', 'end', 'up', 'scaring', 'half-silly.But', 'main', 'difference', 'shows', 'even', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'movie', 'PA', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'actually', 'strange', 'spooky', 'stuff', 'going', 'not', 'just', 'people', 'suggesting', 'showing', 'dust', 'specks', 'claiming', 'spirit', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'pretty', 'odd', 'frightening.Creating', 'amateur-ish', 'quality', 'most', 'film', 'shot', 'locked-off', 'camera', 'point-of-view', 'little', 'shaking', 'swinging', 'beginning', 'peppered', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'long', 'enough', 'cause', 'motion', 'sickness', 'only', 'movie', 'mystique', 'shots', 'are', 'shot', 'character', 'head', 'only', 'partial', 'view', 'idea', 'just', 'candidly', 'shot', 'home', 'movie.Anyway', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'fun', 'frightful', 'film', 'great', 'see', 'packed', 'audience', 'perfect', 'Halloween', 'season']",N/A

Ghosthunters, Paranormal State, Ghost Adventures, Supernatural, etc. I watch them all.Paranormal Activity was good. It is certainly not as scary as the commercials make it out to be, but it is better than an episode of Ghosthunters. In fact, it is pretty much like Paranormal State.You may get a kick out of the couple's interactions, especially with the boyfriend's obsession with capturing everything on camera and playing it back on his PCs (he has a few).I won't spoil anything for you, but about midway through the movie, you grow a bit tired of the bedroom scenes. The ending is eventful, much better than the letdown that you get with the Blair Witch Project.One more thing...it is somewhat annoying that the time is displayed in the lower-right corner of the screen and the activity happens in the upper-left. The clock often plays an integral role by showing you how time passes overnight, but you are forced to take your eyes off of either the activity or the clock at certain points. At times, you feel like you will miss something if you look down at the on-screen clock. It would have been nice if they were both located on the same side of the screen. Perhaps this is just an issue in the theaters and wouldn't be such a big deal at home?? Or perhaps this is a deliberate device used by the filmmakers to facilitate the shock factor when you are looking away at the on-screen clock and something occurs...I watched this film in the theater early in the morning and by the time I went to bed, I was thoroughly afraid to sleep.  This film burns itself into your consciousness in a way no other film has.  I found myself thinking about it all day because the images it leaves in one's mind are so vivid.

It pretty much failed in ""The Blair Witch Project"", though that was nowhere near as terrible a movie as most make it out to be, and it has spawned numerous imitators which don't even deserve mention. But ""PA"" is not an example of that. No, the plotline is never honed down to a tee, and no, it's not perfect, but it's better than the majority of the stuff out there.Katie and Micah are a young couple (one of the only things I found hard to believe about this movie is that Micah owns a huge house sack with a boulevard and swimming pool and looks like he's getting his first five o clock shadow). Micah is a businessman, and Katie is an Eng major. Katie has been the victim/conduit of a supernatural force since she was eight years old, and yes, we can safely blame her for getting this poor schmuck involved: as he says, ""maybe you should have told me on our 100th date that your were haunted by a demon, okay?"". The premise is no more unbelievable than most horror flicks. Micah is all Wall Street, and let's face it: when Demon meets Wall Street boy, it's going to be love at first sight.Thus he acquiesces to every moronic impulse he has: buying a Ouija which looks less like a Ouija board and more like a ""Black Red Let's Invite Satan In For the Night"" piece of cardboard, even after being advised by the entirely believable, hippy dippy parapsychologist to NOT DO THAT. But you have to give the guy a break: he's not an English major, he's a would be member of the Billionaire Boys' Club and he's doing the best he can. (And what was so ""unbelievable"" about the ""psychic""? He looks exactly like an aging baby boomer who gave up on trying to change the world and now wants to experiment with ""different areas of being"", dig?)This is Hitchcock, so anyone and everyone--I think they're sort of the same group when it comes to people who watch horror movies these days--who want to see stabbings, mutilations, all the new trendy ""Saw"" ways we can watch people get tortured to death should stay away and not bitch. The theme is indeed ""Things That Go Bump In the Night"". The movie borrows heavily from the Exorcist, as all demon films do, only neither of these characters once has the sense to at least get a book about Catholic theology when it's pretty obvious what they need is a priest. The reason is simple: they are, both of them, already heavily under the influence of whatever is in the house. Micah assents to the thing's will when he starts acting stupid, and even invites it into their bedroom with the powder on the floor. When Katie stands and watches her boyfriend/husband/whatever in the wee hours of the morning and swaggers around, that's the demon. (See? Use your imagination!) Micah swaggers the same way in one of the ""nighttime"" scenes. The reason they do not call the demonologist on time and that they cannot handle taking even one sane simple step, like leaving the house, is because Katie's nemesis has begun to infect Micah as well. Nope, they don't act believable all the time, and guess what, sometimes characters in Dostoevsky don't either!They find out far too late what the real problem is, that this entity is a destructive force which wants Micah dead first, then Katie, and to move on. The continuing state of denial before the so-so but ultimately terrifying finale is not because they are stupid (at least not Katie), it is because the demon has gotten everything it wants and then goes in for the kill. It knows there will be no demonologist, no clerical intervention, so it goes buck wild.  Calling Father Merrin would have been a pretty obvious move.The ending could have been more (why the CGI computerized mouth crap? that could have been a classic scene) but nonetheless is pretty scary. It finally has her. I think a mix of the alternate ending and the original would have been appropriate. This is a very, very good horror film, worth owning.",5,"Scary, effective film",1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,4016,"['good', 'reason', 'have', 'bias', 'films', 'employ', ""'re"", 'shooting', 'documentary', 'real', 'life', 'method', 'pretty', 'much', 'failed', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'was', 'nowhere', 'near', 'terrible', 'movie', 'most', 'make', 'out', 'be', 'spawned', 'numerous', 'imitators', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'deserve', 'mention', 'PA', 'not', 'example', 'No', 'plotline', 'never', 'honed', 'down', 'tee', 'not', 'perfect', 'better', 'majority', 'stuff', 'there.Katie', 'Micah', 'are', 'young', 'couple', 'one', 'only', 'things', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', 'movie', 'Micah', 'huge', 'house', 'sack', 'boulevard', 'swimming', 'pool', 'getting', 'first', 'five', 'o', 'clock', 'shadow', 'Micah', 'businessman', 'Katie', 'Eng', 'major', 'Katie', 'been', 'victim/conduit', 'supernatural', 'force', 'was', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'yes', 'can', 'safely', 'blame', 'getting', 'poor', 'schmuck', 'involved', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'told', '100th', 'date', 'were', 'haunted', 'demon', 'premise', 'more', 'unbelievable', 'most', 'horror', 'flicks', 'Micah', 'Wall', 'Street', 'let', 'face', 'when', 'Demon', 'Wall', 'Street', 'boy', 'going', 'be', 'love', 'first', 'sight.Thus', 'moronic', 'impulse', 'buying', 'Ouija', 'less', 'Ouija', 'board', 'more', 'Black', 'Red', 'Let', 'Invite', 'Satan', 'Night', 'piece', 'cardboard', 'even', 'being', 'advised', 'entirely', 'believable', 'hippy', 'dippy', 'parapsychologist', 'NOT', 'DO', 'THAT', 'have', 'give', 'guy', 'break', 'not', 'English', 'major', 'would', 'be', 'member', 'Billionaire', 'Boys', 'Club', 'doing', 'best', 'can', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'psychic', 'exactly', 'aging', 'baby', 'boomer', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'trying', 'change', 'world', 'now', 'experiment', 'different', 'areas', 'being', 'dig', 'Hitchcock', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'think', ""'re"", 'sort', 'same', 'group', 'when', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'horror', 'movies', 'days', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'stabbings', 'mutilations', 'new', 'trendy', 'Saw', 'ways', 'can', 'watch', 'people', 'get', 'tortured', 'death', 'should', 'stay', 'away', 'not', 'bitch', 'theme', 'indeed', 'Things', 'Go', 'Bump', 'Night', 'movie', 'heavily', 'Exorcist', 'demon', 'films', 'do', 'only', 'characters', 'once', 'sense', 'least', 'get', 'book', 'Catholic', 'theology', 'when', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'what', 'need', 'priest', 'reason', 'simple', 'are', 'already', 'heavily', 'influence', 'house', 'Micah', 'assents', 'thing', 'will', 'when', 'acting', 'stupid', 'even', 'bedroom', 'powder', 'floor', 'When', 'Katie', 'boyfriend/husband/whatever', 'wee', 'hours', 'morning', 'swaggers', 'demon', 'See', 'Use', 'imagination', 'Micah', 'same', 'way', 'one', 'nighttime', 'scenes', 'reason', 'do', 'not', 'call', 'demonologist', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'handle', 'taking', 'even', 'one', 'sane', 'simple', 'step', 'leaving', 'house', 'Katie', 'nemesis', 'begun', 'infect', 'Micah', 'as', 'well', 'Nope', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'believable', 'time', 'guess', 'what', 'characters', 'Dostoevsky', 'do', ""n't"", 'either', 'find', 'out', 'far', 'too', 'late', 'what', 'real', 'problem', 'entity', 'destructive', 'force', 'Micah', 'dead', 'first', 'then', 'Katie', 'move', 'continuing', 'state', 'denial', 'so-so', 'ultimately', 'terrifying', 'finale', 'not', 'are', 'stupid', 'least', 'not', 'Katie', 'demon', 'gotten', 'everything', 'then', 'kill', 'will', 'be', 'demonologist', 'clerical', 'intervention', 'buck', 'wild', 'Calling', 'Father', 'Merrin', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'move.The', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'why', 'CGI', 'computerized', 'mouth', 'crap', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'classic', 'scene', 'nonetheless', 'pretty', 'scary', 'finally', 'think', 'mix', 'alternate', 'ending', 'original', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'appropriate', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'worth', 'owning']",N/A
1293703,A4GPHAI2LRIQI,B002VKE0XA,"JJD ""John""","[2, 5]","Let me preface this by stating that I skipped most chapters to solely watch the ""meat"" of the film, as in the bedroom scenes.To me, this film works and has the adverse effect that it seems to have intended. I am a 40 year old man with a rational mind and also the parent of two teens. My daughter wanted to see this with me and I obliged just out of my own curiosity. I'd heard mixed opinions and am not a big fan of the ""home video"" style of film making as the shaky camera tends to get on my nerves. Suffice to say...I did watch this tonight and am having a difficult time sleeping. Hopefully, writing this review will exorcize my own inner demons.On the surface, yes, the story itself is cliched and pretty derivative. What few daytime scenes I did watch were pretty dull and contrived. The Micah character, for all intents and purposes, was pretty idiotic to the point of laughability. I even made the point that his demise at his possessed girlfriend's hand was a prime example of ""natural selection"" and deserved his fate.To me, the movie works on the principle as stated in my review's title. Whether you believe in ghosts, apparitions, or demons, is irrelevant. Anyone that has ever had that uneasy feeling at night can relate, even in some basic and primal way, to the intended scares here. It brought to mind an incident a while back where my wife and I were sleeping...deeply I might add...only to awaken to find our teenage daughter standing by the bedside. Granted, she was wanting some cough medicine and was having a difficult time sleeping. However, awakening from a deep sleep to find a teenage girl hovering over me was an instant jolt. Not that she was trying to scare..or intended any harm for that matter. It's the stark realization that when we are in our deepest sleep, we are ultimately at our most vulnerable. You would be lying if you can say you've never been awaken by a noise at 2:30 in the morning and immediately unnerved and filled with a momentary dread. We grownups know the boogie man doesn't really exist, but that's not to say that there isn't the possibility that the ""unexplained"" can't be just as terrifying.I guess, in short, this movie spoke to me because I have enough sense to know that I don't have all the answers and can't simply explain away every single night terror and sensation of fear I have ever felt in the dead of night. It's a deep and primal emotion we all have, even the most jaded of us. Fear of the dark is natural and part of our psychological make up. While we all know nothing is really there, it is ultimately the fear of the unseen/unknown that taps into that survival instinct.I read also that there is interest in a sequel. Just like Hollywood to take something fresh and just ruin it with more of the same.. Standing alone, I think this film has ""classic"" potential. The lack of a musical score, the cleverly shot ""occurences"", and over all effect just make this one I will likely watch again. I have to commend the director for taking the Speilberg/Hitchcock approach by making the effects subtle and allowing the viewer to fill in the blanks with their own imagination. This is the first horror film I have seen that actually frightened me since ""The Exorcist"".It's such a shame that, despite it's success, there are so many people out there that are so jaded to think that this film fails to provide scares. To me, the best scares aren't the disembowelments and in your face gore fests...it's all about the unknown and unseen.",5,Nocturnal Vulnerability And Dread,1267142400,"02 26, 2010",2010,3498,"['Let', 'preface', 'stating', 'skipped', 'most', 'chapters', 'solely', 'watch', 'meat', 'film', 'bedroom', 'scenes.To', 'film', 'works', 'adverse', 'effect', 'have', 'intended', 'am', '40', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'rational', 'mind', 'also', 'parent', 'two', 'teens', 'daughter', 'wanted', 'see', 'obliged', 'just', 'own', 'curiosity', ""'d"", 'heard', 'mixed', 'opinions', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'home', 'video', 'style', 'film', 'making', 'shaky', 'camera', 'get', 'nerves', 'Suffice', 'say', 'did', 'watch', 'tonight', 'am', 'having', 'difficult', 'time', 'sleeping', 'Hopefully', 'writing', 'review', 'will', 'exorcize', 'own', 'inner', 'surface', 'yes', 'story', 'cliched', 'pretty', 'derivative', 'What', 'few', 'daytime', 'scenes', 'did', 'watch', 'were', 'pretty', 'dull', 'contrived', 'Micah', 'character', 'intents', 'purposes', 'was', 'pretty', 'idiotic', 'point', 'laughability', 'even', 'made', 'point', 'demise', 'possessed', 'girlfriend', 'hand', 'was', 'prime', 'example', 'natural', 'selection', 'deserved', 'fate.To', 'movie', 'principle', 'stated', 'review', 'title', 'believe', 'ghosts', 'apparitions', 'demons', 'irrelevant', 'Anyone', 'ever', 'had', 'uneasy', 'feeling', 'night', 'can', 'relate', 'even', 'basic', 'primal', 'way', 'intended', 'scares', 'here', 'brought', 'mind', 'incident', 'while', 'back', 'where', 'wife', 'were', 'sleeping', 'deeply', 'might', 'add', 'only', 'awaken', 'find', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'standing', 'bedside', 'Granted', 'was', 'wanting', 'cough', 'medicine', 'was', 'having', 'difficult', 'time', 'sleeping', 'However', 'awakening', 'deep', 'sleep', 'find', 'teenage', 'girl', 'hovering', 'was', 'instant', 'jolt', 'Not', 'was', 'trying', 'scare..or', 'intended', 'harm', 'matter', 'stark', 'realization', 'when', 'are', 'deepest', 'sleep', 'are', 'ultimately', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'would', 'be', 'lying', 'can', 'say', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'awaken', 'noise', '2:30', 'morning', 'immediately', 'unnerved', 'filled', 'momentary', 'dread', 'grownups', 'know', 'boogie', 'man', ""n't"", 'really', 'exist', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'possibility', 'unexplained', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'just', 'terrifying.I', 'guess', 'short', 'movie', 'spoke', 'have', 'enough', 'sense', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'answers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'simply', 'explain', 'away', 'single', 'night', 'terror', 'sensation', 'fear', 'have', 'ever', 'felt', 'dead', 'night', 'deep', 'primal', 'emotion', 'have', 'even', 'most', 'jaded', 'Fear', 'dark', 'natural', 'part', 'psychological', 'make', 'up', 'know', 'nothing', 'really', 'there', 'ultimately', 'fear', 'unseen/unknown', 'survival', 'instinct.I', 'read', 'also', 'interest', 'sequel', 'Just', 'Hollywood', 'take', 'something', 'fresh', 'just', 'ruin', 'more', 'same..', 'Standing', 'alone', 'think', 'film', 'classic', 'potential', 'lack', 'musical', 'score', 'cleverly', 'shot', 'occurences', 'effect', 'just', 'make', 'one', 'will', 'likely', 'watch', 'again', 'have', 'commend', 'director', 'taking', 'Speilberg/Hitchcock', 'approach', 'making', 'effects', 'subtle', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'fill', 'blanks', 'own', 'imagination', 'first', 'horror', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'actually', 'frightened', 'Exorcist', '.It', 'such', 'shame', 'success', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'out', 'there', 'are', 'so', 'jaded', 'think', 'film', 'provide', 'scares', 'best', 'scares', 'are', ""n't"", 'disembowelments', 'face', 'gore', 'fests', 'unknown', 'unseen']",N/A

His girlfriend Katie (Katie Featherston) seems to be the focus of the demons attacks and she becomes more and more troubled and disturbed as the actions of this demon get more forceful. Given the handheld camera view and the constant night time views of them sleeping in their bedroom it can be seen as boring by some and by no means is the acting that great, the story however is simple and the chills are effective.As Micah and Katie try to figure out what this thing wants, it becomes plenty obvious it wants Katie and will do anything to get her. The closing minutes and the final sequences are quite chilling to me, the conclusion was nice and set up the sequel quite well in my opinion. I do admit to enjoying this movie quite a lot, it at least presents a simple story on the surface that does have some layers to it the more you watch it and the sequel, since they do tie into each other. I have an appreciation for it after watching the sequel and even the third one, so I do credit director Oren Peli for making something that does show how two people just can't do anything to prevent this demon from accomplishing its task.One thing I do want to add is Katie is quite a beautiful woman, definitely kept my attention whenever she was on screen. I do recommend this movie, though I do get why people don't enjoy it, since I found it chilling I added this and the sequels to my DVD library.

The documentary-style film chronicles approximately three weeks of trauma, until finally coming to a resolution that leaves the audience shaken, albeit hardly surprised.Although some, or even many, will be discouraged by the leisurely pace at which the film limits itself to, it ultimately should be appreciated, as the slow buildup in tension eventually leaves the audience breathless with anticipation.Although they are growing increasingly more commonplace in the new age industry, I feel obligated to warn cinema traditionalists that yes, this is shot adhering to the Blair Witch style of film making, and yes, you will be left struggling more with what your imagination can conjure up than what the movie presents to you; the latter, fortunately, is something that only the most keen thriller director's can craft with expertise, and Peli does so marvelously.Not to be dismissed is the acting talent:  Two no-name performers that commit to their roles so smoothly that it is easy to overlook them.  The casual humor and trivial banter that the two bring to the table is both charming and credible; their bond will certainly reach you, and it strengthens the emotional impact of each event that they find themselves in.To say that this is one of the most terrifying films in recent history is no real stretch but, alas, its competition is growing increasingly more pitiful.  With that said, its vital that we recognize the few gems of talent that gradually arise from the masses of mediocrity, and I am pleased to say tat Peli's ""Paranormal Activity"" is the next diamond in the rough.",4,Paranormal Activity,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,2174,"['Predictably', 'industry', 'begun', 'awaken', 'catatonic', 'state', 'releasing', 'stale', 'gore-fests', 'mechanical', 'fashion', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'would', 'take', 'indie', 'director', 'make', 'ambitious', 'leap.Rocketed', 'steady', 'stream', 'justified', 'internet', 'hype', 'Oren', 'Peli', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'up', 'name', 'genuinely', 'disturbing', 'piece', 'minimalist', 'cinema', 'real', 'crowd', 'pleaser', 'boot.The', 'story', 'deceptively', 'typical', 'centering', 'couple', 'coping', 'ghostly', 'events', 'slowly', 'escalate', 'violence', 'intimacy', 'victims', 'documentary-style', 'film', 'chronicles', 'approximately', 'three', 'weeks', 'trauma', 'finally', 'coming', 'resolution', 'audience', 'shaken', 'hardly', 'surprised.Although', 'even', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'discouraged', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'film', 'ultimately', 'should', 'be', 'appreciated', 'slow', 'buildup', 'tension', 'eventually', 'audience', 'breathless', 'are', 'growing', 'increasingly', 'more', 'commonplace', 'new', 'age', 'industry', 'feel', 'obligated', 'warn', 'cinema', 'traditionalists', 'yes', 'shot', 'adhering', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'style', 'film', 'making', 'yes', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'struggling', 'more', 'what', 'imagination', 'can', 'conjure', 'up', 'what', 'movie', 'latter', 'fortunately', 'something', 'only', 'most', 'keen', 'thriller', 'director', 'can', 'craft', 'expertise', 'Peli', 'so', 'marvelously.Not', 'be', 'dismissed', 'acting', 'talent', 'Two', 'no-name', 'performers', 'commit', 'roles', 'so', 'smoothly', 'easy', 'overlook', 'casual', 'humor', 'trivial', 'banter', 'two', 'bring', 'table', 'charming', 'credible', 'bond', 'will', 'certainly', 'reach', 'emotional', 'impact', 'event', 'find', 'in.To', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'terrifying', 'films', 'recent', 'history', 'real', 'stretch', 'alas', 'competition', 'growing', 'increasingly', 'more', 'pitiful', 'said', 'vital', 'recognize', 'few', 'gems', 'talent', 'gradually', 'arise', 'masses', 'mediocrity', 'am', 'pleased', 'say', 'tat', 'Peli', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'next', 'diamond', 'rough']",N/A

I decided to give it a 2.  It was boring.  I mean, it did make me jump.  But oh well.  A 2 it is.Fear is described as an unpleasant usually strong emotion caused by anticipation or awareness of danger.  You surely do feel fear when watching this movie.  It's little things that scare you.  You won't see men standing in the shadows with a knife and blood all over him.  Nor will you see monsters or creatures of the sort.  The things that happen in this movie that make you afraid are the unknown.The movie has a very simple story.  A man and lady think something is going on in there house.  So, the man decides to set up stuff to record the sounds in there home as well as get a camera to video tape.  He even records them when they sleep.  You can see the time on the bottom of the screen.  At first they play the time by fast.  Skipping through hours in a few seconds.  Then, they stop and show it in real time.  Your heart starts racing and the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.  Why?  Well, you wonder why they have started to play the video in normal speed.  Even if you don't hear or see anything.  It actually adds more fear not seeing stuff.  Makes you wonder when or if you will eventually.  Sometimes the lady till get out of bed and stand looking at the man in bed.  Hours go by and she just stands, watching.  Again, the not knowing what she is going to do will make you almost scream.  It's amazing how so little can do so much.  More writers should watch this movie and think about it.The horror of the film is kind of ruined when watching it at home, while at the same time adding some fear.  You loose some because your at home.  You can turn down the TV or even fast forward through to see what will happen.  I turned down my TV.  If I had seen it in the theater I would have probably been shaking.  You add a little fear as well though.  Why?  Well, your watching it at home.  The movie is all inside the peoples house.  At home your either alone or with only a few people.  When the movie is through you will probably start looking around and jumping when you hear a creek, crack or sound.  No matter how loud or soft.I had given this a 4 at first.  But I mean, the story is really pointless.  Anyone could have written it.  Seeing a movie that has a monster grow out of a rock and walk through your wall, while possibly being scary, isn't real.  I mean, who is going to be afraid that something like that will happen?  This movie is simple and really does seem like a home movie.  The ending is the worst part.  It totally ruins the movie.  While the movie makes you think that it could happen to you or anyone, the end just goes all sci fi  and ends like a typical horror movie.  I will not say what happens.  There is nothing extra on this movie except for alternate endings.  I mean, how much money did this movie cost to make and how much did it actually make.  Seems they could have sold it for 10 dollars and loaded it with extra stuff.  I would wait for a while before buying.  They will probably release a version of the DVD with extra stuff.  So no one says what I know they will say, I didn't base my review on the lack of extras.  I based it on what the movie made me feel.  I actually didn't like the movie at all.",2,This movie will make you jump.

1293715,AABGV02YMQ2OZ,B002VKE0XA,"J. Ryan ""JRyan""","[5, 11]","The entire film was made using a budget of roughly $11,000. Almost all 86 minutes of the film take place inside one room of the house. It consists mostly of one camera position the entire time. 95% of the film consists of just two actors, one of whom has only one previous film to their name, and the other has none. And more or less, this is a just ghost story. Everything about this movie is simple and seems like it could have been made by just about anyone. And therein lies its brilliance; using a minimalist approach and a slow, yet deliberate pace, Paranormal Activity is a stunningly effective horror film that makes watching two people sleeping in a dark room some of the most suspenseful and terrifying moments you will ever experience while watching a movie.What makes this film so effective are the two main characters, Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat). Everything from their conversations, to their facial expressions, and their body movements are so perfectly executed and believable that it makes us think this might be actual footage we are watching. You become emotionally invested in them (specifically Katie) that you can actually feel their sense of paranoia escalating throughout the whole film. They have no idea what is going to happen next, and neither do we.The premise of the film is very simple--Katie has been being haunted on and off since she was a little girl by what she believes to be a ghost. Moving into a new house with her boyfriend Micah, these ""hauntings"" start up again. Her boyfriend, not having known about this when they moved in together, becomes excited at first about the whole thing and wants to investigate it more. He goes out and buys a video camera and sets it up stationary on a tripod in their bedroom while they sleep in hopes of catching something, if anything on tape.One of the best things about this movie, and why you should see it at least once in theaters, is the audience and their growing sense of fear throughout the film. You could literally feel the tension in the movie theatre. As the days go by, the hauntings get worse. Each time the night footage started, you could hear nearly everyone in their audience rustling their seats, anxious and terrified about what might happen next. By the last two nighttime footages are playing, people in the audience were screaming before anything even happened. The film does an excellent job of playing on human being's fear of the dark and of the unknown.For being a horror film, up until the last scene, there is almost no violence at all. It uses atmosphere, setting, and mood to build up tension throughout the film.  It also does a great job of not showing too much on camera and letting the audience try guess for themselves what exactly is happening. In fact, one of the most frightening parts of the movies is a scene in which neither character can be seen on camera, but only their voices and movements can be heard coming from downstairs. With that, some people may not enjoy the slower pace and lack of violence and may be turned off when they see this.  Regardless, the last 20 minutes alone should be enough frighten those with even the thickest of skin.It is a movie like no-other and undoubtedly one of the best horror films to come along in years. Time will tell, but in my opinion, this could eventually be tagged alongside the likes of The Exorcist and Poltergeist as one of the scariest movies of all time. Once you see this, the creaking of floorboards and the droning of pipes at night may never sound the same.Grade: 9.0/10[...]",5,A Stunningly Effective Horror Film,1255737600,"10 17, 2009",2009,3573,"['entire', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'using', 'budget', 'roughly', '11,000', 'Almost', '86', 'minutes', 'film', 'take', 'place', 'one', 'room', 'house', 'mostly', 'one', 'camera', 'position', 'entire', 'time', '95', '%', 'film', 'just', 'two', 'actors', 'one', 'whom', 'only', 'one', 'previous', 'film', 'name', 'other', 'none', 'more', 'less', 'just', 'ghost', 'story', 'Everything', 'movie', 'simple', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'just', 'anyone', 'therein', 'brilliance', 'using', 'minimalist', 'approach', 'slow', 'yet', 'deliberate', 'pace', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'stunningly', 'effective', 'horror', 'film', 'watching', 'two', 'people', 'sleeping', 'dark', 'room', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'terrifying', 'moments', 'will', 'ever', 'experience', 'watching', 'movie.What', 'film', 'so', 'effective', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Katie', 'Katie', 'Featherston', 'Micah', 'Micah', 'Sloat', 'Everything', 'conversations', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body', 'movements', 'are', 'so', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'believable', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'actual', 'footage', 'are', 'watching', 'become', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'specifically', 'Katie', 'can', 'actually', 'feel', 'sense', 'paranoia', 'escalating', 'whole', 'film', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'neither', 'do', 'we.The', 'premise', 'film', 'very', 'simple', 'Katie', 'been', 'being', 'haunted', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'what', 'be', 'ghost', 'Moving', 'new', 'house', 'boyfriend', 'Micah', 'hauntings', 'start', 'up', 'again', 'boyfriend', 'not', 'having', 'known', 'when', 'moved', 'together', 'becomes', 'excited', 'first', 'whole', 'thing', 'investigate', 'more', 'out', 'video', 'camera', 'sets', 'up', 'stationary', 'tripod', 'bedroom', 'sleep', 'hopes', 'catching', 'something', 'anything', 'tape.One', 'best', 'things', 'movie', 'why', 'should', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'theaters', 'audience', 'growing', 'sense', 'fear', 'film', 'could', 'literally', 'feel', 'tension', 'movie', 'theatre', 'days', 'go', 'hauntings', 'get', 'worse', 'time', 'night', 'footage', 'started', 'could', 'hear', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'audience', 'rustling', 'seats', 'anxious', 'terrified', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'next', 'last', 'two', 'nighttime', 'footages', 'are', 'playing', 'people', 'audience', 'were', 'screaming', 'anything', 'even', 'happened', 'film', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'human', 'being', 'fear', 'dark', 'unknown.For', 'being', 'horror', 'film', 'up', 'last', 'scene', 'almost', 'violence', 'atmosphere', 'setting', 'mood', 'build', 'up', 'tension', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'not', 'showing', 'too', 'much', 'camera', 'letting', 'audience', 'try', 'guess', 'what', 'exactly', 'happening', 'fact', 'one', 'most', 'frightening', 'parts', 'movies', 'scene', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'camera', 'only', 'voices', 'movements', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'coming', 'downstairs', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'enjoy', 'slower', 'pace', 'lack', 'violence', 'may', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'when', 'see', 'Regardless', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'alone', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'frighten', 'even', 'thickest', 'skin.It', 'movie', 'no-other', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'films', 'come', 'along', 'years', 'Time', 'will', 'tell', 'opinion', 'could', 'eventually', 'be', 'tagged', 'likes', 'Exorcist', 'Poltergeist', 'one', 'scariest', 'movies', 'time', 'Once', 'see', 'creaking', 'floorboards', 'droning', 'pipes', 'night', 'may', 'never', 'sound', 'same.Grade', '9.0/10', '[', ']']",N/A

Kennedy ""in statu uiae et meriti""","[1, 1]","Comparisons to the Blair Witch Project are inevitable since this movie also uses the ""cinema verite"" trope in which the main characters are also the cinematographers, documenting the supposed phenomena which are occurring around them.  I call Paranormal Activity slightly better than Blair Witch only because more of the footage is from a tripod-mounted camera rather than handheld, thus causing less seasickness in the viewer.The supernatural scares are essentially the same in both movies:  The characters spend more time scaring themselves than witnessing any actually scary events.  It's got the obligatory cussing and the standard jerk character who doesn't take the manifestations seriously until it's too late.  There are strange noises but very little actually happens onscreen.  I was pleased by the level of ""authenticity"" i.e. how similar most of the phenomena were to recorded cases of actual poltergeist hauntings.  It starts out with minor bumps in the night and gradually escalates into stranger and mor frightening disturbances.The filmmaking style is simple, low-budget, but for the most part effective.  I wish it had stayed cheap and vague throughout, because the few ""special effects"" come across as very contrived and disappointing .. except for the last one (I can't say exactly what this is since I don't want to spoil the most exciting part of the movie for those who haven't seen it.)  The DVD version includes an alternate ending which was immensely more satisfying than the goofy theatrical ending (a prop which is seen at the beginning actually pays off in the alternate ending, leading me to believe this is what the director originally intended.)  Though the alternate ending is better, it still deflates the terror by showing too much.

This bland misogyny parable makes ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""The Last Broadcast"" look like ""Citizen Kane"" by comparison.Yes, I think we all know by now that horror movies which don't succumb to tossing around buckets of gore or parading monsters before the camera every few minutes create more tension, but the studios don't buy into intellectual horror specifically because the money's in more meat-headed fare. Newsflash: Most of the general movie-going public are knuckle-dragging oxygen wasters. By god, the latest ""Friday the 13th,"" which cost a mere $19 million, scared up $65 domestically, and there's nothing more shocking about a Jason Voorhees slashfest than the Mandrill cage at the zoo right before feeding time.Studios don't take gambles, period, and this is not intellectual horror anyway. The icing on the cake is the cheesy reworked ending that leaves room for sequel after sequel (and mark my words, ""Paranormal Activity 2"" is guaranteed to be a gorefest). Besides, the formula for this outing has already been successfully tested: Hype it and they will come. Throw in a few stories about people bolting from the theater mid-film (I wouldn't be surprised to find out people were paid to run from the aisles) and presto! No wonder a useless hamster cat-toy is the best-selling holiday item for humans this year. I'm a rat in a cage, indeed.The acting, adequate at first, quickly turns annoying and unbelievable (this couple is too trailer trash to actually live in a nice area of San Diego -- the boyfriend is too much of a borderline personality to realistically be ""engaged to be engaged"" with anybody, and the girlfriend is like some latchkey kid who never grew up; I'm not surprised at all by how things turn out for the guy in the end. Like I said, it's just a supernaturally tinged exercise in personality disorders.Even though there are no special effects, no manifestation of evil, this film still manages to go for cheap frights. Think of the black cat jumping out of the darkness in a Hammer film ... and nothing more complex. And if you actually think the scenes of the camera filming the bed ARE scary after the 10th time -- this thing is like ""Groundhog Day"" without any of its charm, for chrissakes -- you deserve to live in the bubble with which you surround yourself.",1,You get what they paid for,1259366400,"11 28, 2009",2009,2824,"['fact', 'decent', 'critics', 'not', 'mention', 'flacks', 'disguise', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'Peter', 'Travers', 'gave', 'highly', 'unoriginal', 'amateurish', 'film', 'high', 'rating', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'monkeyed', 'out', 'trailer-park', 'idiot', 'level', 'Shrub', 'choking', 'pretzel', 'reference', 'possessed', 'bathroom', 'help', 'generate', 'buzz', 'project', 'was', 'purchase', 'general', 'public', 'forked', 'more', '100', 'million', 'precious', 'recession', 'bucks', 'cardboard', 'thrill', 'ride', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'bland', 'misogyny', 'parable', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Last', 'Broadcast', 'look', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'comparison.Yes', 'think', 'know', 'now', 'horror', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'succumb', 'tossing', 'buckets', 'gore', 'parading', 'monsters', 'camera', 'few', 'minutes', 'create', 'more', 'tension', 'studios', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'intellectual', 'horror', 'specifically', 'money', 'more', 'meat-headed', 'fare', 'Most', 'general', 'movie-going', 'public', 'are', 'knuckle-dragging', 'oxygen', 'wasters', 'god', 'latest', 'Friday', '13th', 'cost', 'mere', '19', 'million', 'scared', 'up', '65', 'domestically', 'nothing', 'more', 'shocking', 'Jason', 'Voorhees', 'slashfest', 'Mandrill', 'cage', 'zoo', 'right', 'feeding', 'time.Studios', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'gambles', 'period', 'not', 'intellectual', 'horror', 'anyway', 'icing', 'cake', 'cheesy', 'reworked', 'ending', 'room', 'sequel', 'sequel', 'mark', 'words', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '2', 'guaranteed', 'be', 'gorefest', 'formula', 'outing', 'already', 'been', 'successfully', 'tested', 'Hype', 'will', 'come', 'Throw', 'few', 'stories', 'people', 'bolting', 'theater', 'mid-film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'people', 'were', 'paid', 'run', 'aisles', 'presto', 'wonder', 'useless', 'hamster', 'cat-toy', 'best-selling', 'holiday', 'item', 'humans', 'year', ""'m"", 'rat', 'cage', 'indeed.The', 'acting', 'adequate', 'first', 'quickly', 'annoying', 'unbelievable', 'couple', 'too', 'trailer', 'trash', 'actually', 'live', 'nice', 'area', 'San', 'Diego', 'boyfriend', 'too', 'much', 'borderline', 'personality', 'realistically', 'be', 'engaged', 'be', 'engaged', 'anybody', 'girlfriend', 'latchkey', 'kid', 'who', 'never', 'grew', 'up', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'how', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'guy', 'end', 'said', 'just', 'supernaturally', 'tinged', 'exercise', 'personality', 'disorders.Even', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'manifestation', 'evil', 'film', 'still', 'go', 'cheap', 'frights', 'Think', 'black', 'cat', 'jumping', 'darkness', 'Hammer', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'complex', 'actually', 'think', 'scenes', 'camera', 'filming', 'bed', 'ARE', 'scary', '10th', 'time', 'thing', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'charm', 'chrissakes', 'deserve', 'live', 'bubble', 'surround']",N/A
1293721,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B002VKE0XA,K. Driscoll,"[0, 3]","However, I'm not so sure it is going to live up to the hype it's getting.  In a sea of pretty darn good horror movies over the last few years, Paranormal Activity is really nothing too special, other than that it is an American movie and that it is coming at audiences with the same combination of realism and mystery that another little-film-that-could did ten years ago;The Blair Witch Project.  Not that the combination is particularly unique now or even ten years ago, it just appears that when it involves ghosts instead of for example zombies (Diary of the DeadorThe Zombie Diaries) or Belgian serial killers (1992'sMan Bites Dog), it makes a a lot of money considering its cost and gets a ton of mainstream attention.  This movies cost about $10,000 to make and has grossed over $30 million.I saw Paranormal Activity Friday night and found it quite compelling, which if it wasn't the whole thing would've failed miserably.  The audience reactions were rumored to be quite positive, with some people screaming and peeing their pants and so forth, but the crowd around me was a little different.  In fact, given it was a packed theater and the film had previously only had limited release, I'm not too surprised.  Horror films are something you really have to want to enjoy, especially ones that require a more robust imagination like this one.  When it was in limited release the audience may have for the most part been seeking out the film because they are genre fans, but upon a wider release the casual movie-going riff-raff will see it, especially if it means showing their girlfriends that they ain't afraid of no ghosts.  Folks actually booed the film when I saw it and I even heard comments like ""I'm sorry but dude, that sucked"" and ""that wasn't scawy at all!"".  These are the same guys that will hold their bowels tightly when riding a roller-coaster, instead of throwing up their arms to accentuate the fun.  These are also the same idiots that will be seeing garbage like Saw VI in a few weeks, but I digress.The film follows Micah and Katie, who have just moved in together.  Katie has experienced strange encounters her entire life and Micah, a laughably naive skeptic, documents their experience in their new home together.  In fact, Micah consistently antagonizes this ghostly force by shouting at it and even getting a Ouija board.  The activity itself gradually escalates as the film goes forward but there is far too much to give away, especially if you've found yourself enjoying movies like this in the past.This is well done and uses almost all of the usual tools in the horror genre effectively with one notable exception; gore.  I understand the principal behind not using gore and maybe even why they wouldn't need it, but the movie does lend itself to moments where it could have been used very well. Nevertheless, this is still a very decent horror movie and is certainly creepy enough in flashes to recommend checking out.",4,Paranormal Activity is Compelling and Creepy,1255910400,"10 19, 2009",2009,2956,"['However', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'going', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'getting', 'sea', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'horror', 'movies', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'really', 'nothing', 'too', 'special', 'other', 'American', 'movie', 'coming', 'audiences', 'same', 'combination', 'realism', 'mystery', 'little-film-that-could', 'did', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Not', 'combination', 'particularly', 'unique', 'now', 'even', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'just', 'when', 'ghosts', 'instead', 'example', 'zombies', 'Diary', 'DeadorThe', 'Zombie', 'Diaries', 'Belgian', 'serial', 'killers', ""1992'sMan"", 'Bites', 'Dog', 'lot', 'money', 'considering', 'cost', 'ton', 'mainstream', 'attention', 'movies', 'cost', '10,000', 'make', 'grossed', '30', 'million.I', 'saw', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Friday', 'night', 'found', 'quite', 'compelling', 'was', ""n't"", 'whole', 'thing', 'would', ""'ve"", 'failed', 'miserably', 'audience', 'reactions', 'were', 'rumored', 'be', 'quite', 'positive', 'people', 'screaming', 'peeing', 'pants', 'so', 'forth', 'crowd', 'was', 'little', 'different', 'fact', 'given', 'was', 'packed', 'theater', 'film', 'had', 'previously', 'only', 'had', 'limited', 'release', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'surprised', 'Horror', 'films', 'are', 'something', 'really', 'have', 'want', 'enjoy', 'especially', 'ones', 'require', 'more', 'robust', 'imagination', 'one', 'When', 'was', 'limited', 'release', 'audience', 'may', 'have', 'most', 'part', 'been', 'seeking', 'film', 'are', 'genre', 'fans', 'wider', 'release', 'casual', 'movie-going', 'riff-raff', 'will', 'see', 'especially', 'showing', 'girlfriends', 'ai', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'ghosts', 'Folks', 'actually', 'booed', 'film', 'when', 'saw', 'even', 'heard', 'comments', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'dude', 'sucked', 'was', ""n't"", 'scawy', 'are', 'same', 'guys', 'will', 'hold', 'bowels', 'tightly', 'when', 'riding', 'roller-coaster', 'instead', 'throwing', 'up', 'arms', 'accentuate', 'fun', 'are', 'also', 'same', 'idiots', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'garbage', 'Saw', 'VI', 'few', 'weeks', 'digress.The', 'film', 'Micah', 'Katie', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'moved', 'together', 'Katie', 'experienced', 'strange', 'encounters', 'entire', 'life', 'Micah', 'laughably', 'naive', 'skeptic', 'documents', 'experience', 'new', 'home', 'together', 'fact', 'Micah', 'consistently', 'ghostly', 'force', 'shouting', 'even', 'getting', 'Ouija', 'board', 'activity', 'gradually', 'film', 'forward', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'give', 'away', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'found', 'enjoying', 'movies', 'past.This', 'well', 'done', 'almost', 'usual', 'tools', 'horror', 'genre', 'effectively', 'one', 'notable', 'exception', 'gore', 'understand', 'principal', 'not', 'using', 'gore', 'maybe', 'even', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'need', 'movie', 'lend', 'moments', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'very', 'well', 'Nevertheless', 'still', 'very', 'decent', 'horror', 'movie', 'certainly', 'creepy', 'enough', 'flashes', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out']",N/A

1293723,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B002VKE0XA,Kevin Killian,"[0, 2]","The guy who plays the paranormal expert is so bad in this, he makes the two main actors seem like Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, which they definitely are not, except that the girl does convince you that she's troubled, and the guy, Micah, convinces you that he would be an awful pain in the neck to have as a boyfriend and enough with the camera already!I think he got the camera hoping to film the two of them having sex, and we see her putting the kibosh on that idea of his....  Then it all comes out about her past, and the gloves are off.Katie has been attracting ghosts since she was a young girl, and this fits with the Freudian theories of the late Nandor Fodor, whose seminal book The Haunted Mind (1960) explored a theory that would provide a psychoanalytic explanation for hauntings and the occult--particularly poltergeists, who seem to crop up only in households in which a young girl (in rare cases a boy) is undergoing the throes of puberty, as though the spirits were drawn to this energy.  Fodor speculates that the psychic energy is caused not only by hormones, but happens only when the subject has been molested, often by an older male figure in her family.Is this what happened way back when to Katie?  We notice that she has a younger sister whom, I expect, she was perhaps trying to protect from adult molestation by (manufacturing or inviting) the production of the poltergeist.Needless to say, this anger at predatory men finds its ultimate expression in--well, no more spoilers from me!I dock this movie one whole star because of the ridiculous way Katie pronounces the name ""Micah.""  She sounds like an idiot, and so does he for replying.  But now I don't know, maybe it's the way the actor pronounces it in real life?  ""Meekuh""?

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 3]","Banking on the added ""realism"" of using a home video camera, ""Paranormal Activity"" plays out on the screen in a fashion very similar to films such as ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield.""  Much like these two films, the success of this movie relies heavily on the execution of this gimmicky style of filming.The film opens with Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) fairly settled into their new home.  Micah has purchased a camera in order to capture ""paranormal"" events that Katie believes are happening in the house.  She also believes that the ""activity"" has actually been following her around since she was around eight years old.  After a few scenes of the couple adjusting to life with the camera, we make it to the first night of Micah's experiment with the camera.  With just a few breaks in between, this is how the majority of the rest of the film plays out.At first, nothing major happens.  The couple catches a door swaying open and shut and catch noises hear and there.  After discussing the events with a psychic (Mark Fredrichs), the couple begin to part ways on Micah's experiments.  The psychic warns the couple that whatever being is in the home with them is quite possibly demonic and that they shouldn't taunt, confront, or open dialogue with the entity.  This only fuels Micah's desire to ""catch"" a ghost on camera or make contact with it.  Katie demands that he stop doing this, but Micah insists on continuing his tests.As Micah treads on despite Katie's protests, the events becoming more sinister and scary for the couple.  They call a recommended demonologist to help them, but he is out of town for a few days.  Instead, the psychic returns and immediately flees the home fearing that his presence might actually increase the activities going on in the home.  Who or what is the entity?  What does it want with Katie?  You'll have to check out ""Paranormal Activity"" to find out.Before I go any further, I want to say that I enjoyed ""Paranormal Activity.""  It is a much smarter film than ""Blair Witch"" and I actually felt sorry for Katie as the events became creepier and more violent.  Micah came off as quite the jerk in the film and had I been Katie I would have shown him the door long before the paranormal activity got bad.  While Micah was a bonehead, he wasn't the type you'd typically find in most horror films.  He wanted to tackle the entity because his ego wouldn't allow him to fail.  Unfortunately, this caused a strain on his relationship with Katie and quite possibly fueled the entity's desire to terrorize them even more.While the characters were decent enough (and not too over-the-top), the film did have a few major lulls in it.  Shows like ""Ghosthunters"" and ""Ghosthunters International"" leave out the dull hours of footage where nothing happens for a reason:  it's boring.  In this film, perhaps to capture some of the ""reality"" of an actual investigation, we often get to see long segments of time where literally nothing happens.As for the investigation techniques, I did appreciate the fact that Peli allowed his characters to utilize cameras, digital voice recorders, and the assistance of a psychic for Micah's tests.  The use of powder to capture foot and/or handprints has also been used in paranormal research and allows for added creepiness in this film.  Peli also stayed par for the course on what supposedly occurs during a demonic haunting event by utilizing the attic of the house, the number of knocks heard during the night, and the disoriented state of Katie at times.  Kudos to Peli for researching the research.***SPOILER ALERT***With this praise given, I do have to knock Peli on two things.  First, while many paranormal investigators agree on the dangers of using a Ouija board, I felt that the ""fire"" event involving the board took away from the overall authenticity of the film.  Secondly, CGI works good in many films, but killed the ending of this movie for me.  I preferred the alternate ending on the disc.***END SPOILERS***In summary, I applaud this film for attempting to give a very real and authentic look at paranormal research, albeit with just a couple of misteps that took away from the overall quality of the film.  However, much like watching a person tackle a virus on a computer, paranormal research can be very, very boring at times.  This makes ""Paranormal Activity"" suffer overall, and therefore I give it three stars.",3,Where Are The Ghosthunters When You Need Them?,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,4430,"['Banking', 'added', 'realism', 'using', 'home', 'video', 'camera', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'out', 'screen', 'fashion', 'very', 'similar', 'films', 'such', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Cloverfield', 'Much', 'two', 'films', 'success', 'movie', 'heavily', 'execution', 'gimmicky', 'style', 'filming.The', 'film', 'Katie', 'Katie', 'Featherston', 'Micah', 'Micah', 'Sloat', 'fairly', 'settled', 'new', 'home', 'Micah', 'purchased', 'camera', 'order', 'capture', 'paranormal', 'events', 'Katie', 'are', 'happening', 'house', 'also', 'activity', 'actually', 'been', 'following', 'was', 'around', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'few', 'scenes', 'couple', 'adjusting', 'life', 'camera', 'make', 'first', 'night', 'Micah', 'experiment', 'camera', 'just', 'few', 'breaks', 'how', 'majority', 'rest', 'film', 'first', 'nothing', 'major', 'happens', 'couple', 'door', 'swaying', 'open', 'shut', 'catch', 'noises', 'hear', 'there', 'discussing', 'events', 'psychic', 'Mark', 'Fredrichs', 'couple', 'begin', 'part', 'ways', 'Micah', 'experiments', 'psychic', 'couple', 'whatever', 'being', 'home', 'quite', 'possibly', 'demonic', 'should', ""n't"", 'taunt', 'confront', 'open', 'dialogue', 'entity', 'only', 'Micah', 'desire', 'catch', 'ghost', 'camera', 'make', 'contact', 'Katie', 'stop', 'doing', 'Micah', 'continuing', 'tests.As', 'Micah', 'Katie', 'protests', 'events', 'becoming', 'more', 'sinister', 'scary', 'couple', 'call', 'recommended', 'demonologist', 'help', 'town', 'few', 'days', 'Instead', 'psychic', 'returns', 'immediately', 'home', 'fearing', 'presence', 'might', 'actually', 'increase', 'activities', 'going', 'home', 'Who', 'what', 'entity', 'What', 'want', 'Katie', ""'ll"", 'have', 'check', 'out', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'find', 'out.Before', 'go', 'further', 'want', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'much', 'smarter', 'film', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'actually', 'felt', 'sorry', 'Katie', 'events', 'became', 'creepier', 'more', 'violent', 'Micah', 'came', 'off', 'quite', 'jerk', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'Katie', 'would', 'have', 'shown', 'door', 'long', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'got', 'bad', 'Micah', 'was', 'bonehead', 'was', ""n't"", 'type', ""'d"", 'typically', 'find', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'wanted', 'tackle', 'entity', 'ego', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'fail', 'Unfortunately', 'caused', 'strain', 'relationship', 'Katie', 'quite', 'possibly', 'fueled', 'entity', 'desire', 'terrorize', 'even', 'more.While', 'characters', 'were', 'decent', 'enough', 'not', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'major', 'lulls', 'Ghosthunters', 'Ghosthunters', 'International', 'leave', 'out', 'dull', 'hours', 'footage', 'where', 'nothing', 'reason', 'boring', 'film', 'perhaps', 'capture', 'reality', 'actual', 'investigation', 'often', 'get', 'see', 'long', 'segments', 'time', 'where', 'literally', 'nothing', 'happens.As', 'investigation', 'techniques', 'did', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'Peli', 'allowed', 'characters', 'utilize', 'cameras', 'digital', 'voice', 'recorders', 'assistance', 'psychic', 'Micah', 'tests', 'use', 'powder', 'capture', 'foot', 'and/or', 'handprints', 'also', 'been', 'used', 'paranormal', 'research', 'added', 'creepiness', 'film', 'Peli', 'also', 'stayed', 'par', 'course', 'what', 'supposedly', 'demonic', 'haunting', 'event', 'utilizing', 'attic', 'house', 'number', 'knocks', 'heard', 'night', 'disoriented', 'state', 'Katie', 'times', 'Kudos', 'Peli', 'researching', 'research', '***SPOILER', 'ALERT***With', 'praise', 'given', 'do', 'have', 'knock', 'Peli', 'two', 'things', 'First', 'many', 'paranormal', 'investigators', 'agree', 'dangers', 'using', 'Ouija', 'board', 'felt', 'fire', 'event', 'involving', 'board', 'took', 'away', 'overall', 'authenticity', 'film', 'Secondly', 'CGI', 'good', 'many', 'films', 'killed', 'ending', 'movie', 'preferred', 'alternate', 'ending', 'disc', '***END', 'SPOILERS***In', 'summary', 'applaud', 'film', 'attempting', 'give', 'very', 'real', 'authentic', 'look', 'paranormal', 'research', 'just', 'couple', 'misteps', 'took', 'away', 'overall', 'quality', 'film', 'However', 'much', 'watching', 'person', 'virus', 'computer', 'paranormal', 'research', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'boring', 'times', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'suffer', 'overall', 'therefore', 'give', 'three', 'stars']",N/A
1293726,AJLYAY1G5Z8GE,B002VKE0XA,"Khaled Altaher ""Khaled""","[0, 4]","The movie is quite freaky. Its a story of a couple who believe there is a demon in their house. They plug cameras everywhere and try to catch on tape the strange things that happen in the house. They do, and they get totally freaked out.I watched this movie knowing that its not real, it still was so scary. However I know people who watched it thinking its all true, and they couldn't sleep at night. The simplicity in the movie is what freaks you out the most. You can easily relate to the couple and to the fears they have. However there are 3 signs in the film that tell you its not real, they are as follows:1) They stayed for at least 20 nights in the house facing the fears every night. If someone knows there is a demon in the house trying to haunt him/her, he/she would move out immediately. Even if you think it will follow you, you would go live with a group of people being realtives or friends. Worst case, you would go stay in a hotel where you know you will be surrounded with staff and security guards who will immediately interfere at the first sign of danger. You surely wouldn't stay in the same house knowing its haunted.2) Why did they leave the door of the master bedroom open every night? This is where the demon enters the room from, and the door is what it uses to freak them out. Shut the door, put a closet behind it every day, and try to minimize the risk.

1293733,A2T049UQONS0OY,B002VKE0XA,Larry VanDeSande,"[1, 3]","I like to see the latest horror film at Halloween, the best of which in recent years has been ""The Ring""The Ring (Full Screen Edition), the horrifying story of a girl buried in a well whose spirit comes back to haunt everyone. This was a mystery wrapped in a horror movie that ended cleverly with a way to exploit the inevitable sequel to come.Another memorable film from recent Halloweenish releases was ""The Blair Witch Project""The Blair Witch Project, the film that kicked off the reality in filmmaking style that ""Paranormal Activity"" copies. Blair Witch was, by any standard, a monumental success. It reinvented the horror genre and was the first reality film that confused plenty of viewers into thinking the events in the movie may actually have happened. A cleverly-designed Web site was the only way to determine if it was real or just the movies.Nothing about ""Paranormal Activity"" mimics the finer qualities of either of these predecessors from recent years. Like Blair Witch, this one takes place using a hand-held camera and is a cheapie made on the run by the filmmaker. The entire film takes place in a guy's home in San Diego.The plot revolves around the guy and his live-in girlfriend, who has been followed by an evil spirit since a terrible event in her childhood years. She seeks the advice of professsionals to rid herself of the spirit, and the boyfriend sets up the camera in their bedroom to record any untoward activity that goes on at night. The camera becomes the focal point of the film, as it records everything that goes on in the house.Spooky things do take place in this movie and sometimes they are effective. However, the movie takes at least an hour to really get going and, once it does, any horror film fan is going to guess what's going on through two clues the filmmaker's give about an hour into the movie. The action picks up after that but, since you already know how it's going to end, what's the point?This movie is about average for its style, I'd say. There are some nice moments and the acting is OK throughout. It appears they worked from some kind of script since none of the actors stumble over lines or get tripped up wondering what they were supposed to say. The nighttime scenes that are meant to jar you into gooseflesh work only about half as well as Blair Witch, in part because of the confines of the house.So chalk this up as another inspired attempt to scare the wits out of filmgoers at Halloween that missed the mark, in my view. It's a stylish attempt but one that needed more to go on the first hour to be effective and memorable. It also spoiled its own ending by giving that away in the final 30 minutes.",3,Too sleepy for too long to be effective,1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,2669,"['like', 'see', 'latest', 'horror', 'film', 'Halloween', 'best', 'recent', 'years', 'been', 'Ring', 'Ring', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'horrifying', 'story', 'girl', 'buried', 'well', 'spirit', 'back', 'haunt', 'everyone', 'was', 'mystery', 'wrapped', 'horror', 'movie', 'ended', 'cleverly', 'way', 'exploit', 'inevitable', 'sequel', 'come.Another', 'memorable', 'film', 'recent', 'Halloweenish', 'releases', 'was', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'film', 'kicked', 'reality', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'copies', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'was', 'standard', 'monumental', 'success', 'reinvented', 'horror', 'genre', 'was', 'first', 'reality', 'film', 'confused', 'plenty', 'viewers', 'thinking', 'events', 'movie', 'may', 'actually', 'have', 'happened', 'cleverly-designed', 'Web', 'site', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'determine', 'was', 'real', 'just', 'movies.Nothing', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'mimics', 'finer', 'qualities', 'predecessors', 'recent', 'years', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'one', 'place', 'using', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'cheapie', 'made', 'run', 'filmmaker', 'entire', 'film', 'place', 'guy', 'home', 'San', 'Diego.The', 'plot', 'guy', 'live-in', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'been', 'followed', 'evil', 'spirit', 'terrible', 'event', 'childhood', 'years', 'advice', 'professsionals', 'rid', 'herself', 'spirit', 'boyfriend', 'up', 'camera', 'bedroom', 'record', 'untoward', 'activity', 'night', 'camera', 'focal', 'point', 'film', 'everything', 'house.Spooky', 'things', 'do', 'take', 'place', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'are', 'effective', 'However', 'movie', 'least', 'hour', 'really', 'get', 'going', 'once', 'horror', 'film', 'fan', 'going', 'guess', 'what', 'going', 'two', 'clues', 'filmmaker', 'give', 'hour', 'movie', 'action', 'up', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'going', 'end', 'what', 'point', 'movie', 'about', 'average', 'style', ""'d"", 'say', 'are', 'nice', 'moments', 'acting', 'OK', 'worked', 'kind', 'script', 'none', 'actors', 'stumble', 'lines', 'get', 'tripped', 'up', 'wondering', 'what', 'were', 'supposed', 'say', 'nighttime', 'scenes', 'are', 'meant', 'jar', 'gooseflesh', 'work', 'only', 'about', 'half', 'as', 'well', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'part', 'confines', 'house.So', 'chalk', 'up', 'inspired', 'attempt', 'scare', 'wits', 'filmgoers', 'Halloween', 'missed', 'mark', 'view', 'stylish', 'attempt', 'one', 'needed', 'more', 'go', 'first', 'hour', 'be', 'effective', 'memorable', 'also', 'spoiled', 'own', 'ending', 'giving', 'away', 'final', '30', 'minutes']",N/A

1293739,ASHBFCUZAYCS4,B002VKE0XA,"Lord Schitsdain ""The sage of rage""","[20, 28]","I had seen Roger Ebert review this film and he gave it high marks, so I decided to keep an eye out for it's DVD release. I am always interested in seeing what creative people can do with a small budget and good ideas. Movies like ""El Mariachi"" and ""Primer"" were inspirational in their ambition and execution, so I hoped to be inspired, if not entertained. Sadly, this movie failed on both counts. There are a couple moments of chills, but they are poorly set up and quickly forgotten. The camera is set up to film the bedroom while the characters sleep, but the tape fast forwards to the point where there is a bump in the night, at which point the characters may or may not awaken to investigate, then it's the next day and they seem largely unaffected by the supernatural events. The tension isn't allowed to build, and is over much too quickly. Since there is no real sense of peril to the actors until near the end, the movie fails to create fear or empathy with the audience. Hitchcock filmed ""Rope"" and ""Rear Window"" in what was essentially one room with a view and succeeded in creating tension, providing a backstory, and memorable characters. This movie failed to sustain any energy as events are just plopped in your lap, then it's morning and time for some inane conversation before the next ""chilling moment"". The backstory could be jotted down on a cocktail napkin with room left over for a few phone numbers, and the characters are disposable. After reading all of the one star reviews, I opted to rent rather than buy, so thankfully, if I return the movie in the morning, it will only have cost me $1.99 to discover that I'm not thrilled by slamming doors and footsteps. The guy at the video store said that his daughter slept with her lights on after watching PA. Since I'm neither a drama queen or 4 year old girl I will sleep like a baby sans illumination. A guy walked up and said he had just returned his copy and it was a really good movie and it's also a true story, so I guess if I could have convinced myself that it was a documentary, it really would've been freaky. I'm sure that some people truly were shaken up by this movie, heck, I know people who lock their car doors at intersections, and to you I say ""Congratulations, I'm glad you enjoyed it more than I did, and there are hundreds of movies out there that are going to scare the bejesus out of you."" I just wish I could find a few that could make a lasting impression without resorting to a comical amount of blood and bad dialog. This review is geared more towards someone with a higher threshold for horror. I also rented ""Mirrors"" and it honestly was more exciting before the opening credits than PA in it's entireity, not that it was great, but it had atmosphere and nice visuals. Watching the two movies back to back was like comparing the stick figure flip book that I drew in the margins of my calculus book to ""Citizen Kane"". I realize that PA didn't have much of a budget and it's not a fair comparison, I'm just saying that before you plunk down your hard earned cash, there are much better choices. Rather than waste 90 minutes watching this movie, you should have a friend hold a flashlight under their chin and tell you a ghost story, then use the time you saved to watch ""Stir of Echoes"" instead.",1,"Expected little, experienced much less",1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,3295,"['had', 'seen', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'review', 'film', 'gave', 'high', 'marks', 'decided', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'DVD', 'release', 'am', 'always', 'interested', 'seeing', 'what', 'creative', 'people', 'can', 'do', 'small', 'budget', 'good', 'ideas', 'Movies', 'El', 'Mariachi', 'Primer', 'were', 'inspirational', 'ambition', 'execution', 'hoped', 'be', 'inspired', 'not', 'entertained', 'Sadly', 'movie', 'failed', 'counts', 'are', 'couple', 'moments', 'chills', 'are', 'poorly', 'set', 'up', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'camera', 'set', 'up', 'film', 'bedroom', 'characters', 'sleep', 'tape', 'fast', 'forwards', 'point', 'where', 'bump', 'night', 'point', 'characters', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'awaken', 'investigate', 'then', 'next', 'day', 'seem', 'largely', 'unaffected', 'supernatural', 'events', 'tension', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'build', 'over', 'much', 'too', 'quickly', 'real', 'sense', 'peril', 'actors', 'end', 'movie', 'create', 'fear', 'empathy', 'audience', 'Hitchcock', 'filmed', 'Rope', 'Rear', 'Window', 'what', 'was', 'essentially', 'one', 'room', 'view', 'succeeded', 'creating', 'tension', 'providing', 'backstory', 'memorable', 'characters', 'movie', 'failed', 'sustain', 'energy', 'events', 'are', 'just', 'plopped', 'lap', 'then', 'morning', 'time', 'inane', 'conversation', 'next', 'chilling', 'moment', 'backstory', 'could', 'be', 'jotted', 'down', 'cocktail', 'napkin', 'room', 'left', 'over', 'few', 'phone', 'numbers', 'characters', 'are', 'disposable', 'reading', 'one', 'star', 'reviews', 'opted', 'rent', 'rather', 'buy', 'so', 'thankfully', 'return', 'movie', 'morning', 'will', 'only', 'have', 'cost', '1.99', 'discover', ""'m"", 'not', 'thrilled', 'slamming', 'doors', 'footsteps', 'guy', 'video', 'store', 'said', 'daughter', 'slept', 'lights', 'watching', 'PA', ""'m"", 'drama', 'queen', '4', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'will', 'sleep', 'baby', 'illumination', 'guy', 'walked', 'up', 'said', 'had', 'just', 'returned', 'copy', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'also', 'true', 'story', 'guess', 'could', 'have', 'convinced', 'was', 'documentary', 'really', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'freaky', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'truly', 'were', 'shaken', 'up', 'movie', 'heck', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'lock', 'car', 'doors', 'intersections', 'say', 'Congratulations', ""'m"", 'glad', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'did', 'are', 'hundreds', 'movies', 'there', 'are', 'going', 'scare', 'bejesus', 'just', 'wish', 'could', 'find', 'few', 'could', 'make', 'lasting', 'impression', 'resorting', 'comical', 'amount', 'blood', 'bad', 'dialog', 'review', 'geared', 'more', 'towards', 'someone', 'higher', 'threshold', 'horror', 'also', 'rented', 'Mirrors', 'honestly', 'was', 'more', 'exciting', 'opening', 'credits', 'PA', 'entireity', 'not', 'was', 'great', 'had', 'atmosphere', 'nice', 'visuals', 'Watching', 'two', 'movies', 'back', 'back', 'was', 'comparing', 'stick', 'figure', 'flip', 'book', 'drew', 'margins', 'calculus', 'book', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'realize', 'PA', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'budget', 'not', 'fair', 'comparison', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'plunk', 'down', 'hard', 'earned', 'cash', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'choices', 'Rather', 'waste', '90', 'minutes', 'watching', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'friend', 'hold', 'flashlight', 'chin', 'tell', 'ghost', 'story', 'then', 'use', 'time', 'saved', 'watch', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'instead']",N/A

And I must say that I liked it a lot.This film was made on a microscopic budget of 15.000 (yes, fifteen thousand) USD. Everything occurs inside just one house and its garden. There are only three actors, all totally unknown to me (and the third one appears only briefly). The soundtrack is for all practical purposes absent - and that actually is a good thing, as the mixture of silence and some white noise is in itself pretty creepy. Lights are mostly toned down (and a good thing too!) and the decorations are just those of a regular house. And yet, it ultimately made 300 million USD worldwide - and frankly, once you see it, you will understand why.I am absolutely not saying anything about the plot, on purpose. Just be prepared to a long, very long and slow, very slow beginning - for those who do not like this kind of things, it is better to abstain from watching ""Paranormal Activity"". This beginning is however necessary, because the whole idea behind this movie was a long and slow escalation, a little like in Ravel's ""Bolero"". Another image I had in mind when watching ""Paranormal Activity"" was that of a lion slowly stalking its prey - it walks all the time very slowly but once it has got near enough, every next small step greatly diminishes prey's chances to survive - until the inevitable final leap, very brief but absolutely deadly...Depending on your mood and on your personal taste, this is a film as easy to love as it is to hate. I personally loved it and my wife liked it too - albeit towards the end she tended to cover her face more and more with the blanket, until only one (wide open) eye was left to make peek-a-BOO...)))

While I no longer buy into the fear based dogma of my childhood, I find myself drawn to movies with themes of demons, ghosts, or other supernatural phenomena.  I detest contrite characters/scripts in movies, as well as found-footage films that nauseate me when the credits roll (i.e., Blair Witch).With all that in mind, I found Paranormal Activity fell right up my alley. This is the kind of film that stayed on my mind after watching, and the genuineness of the characters (there really are only two characters for most of this movie) plus the build-in of creep factor and imagining the possibilities of this happening in my bedroom, along with the lack of cheesy chase/scream scenes made this movie for me.  Sound was key.  If you watch this at a regular or lower volume, you will not have as good an experience.  This movie is best watched in the dark, with headphones, so you can get the full effect...it's almost like you're there in the room with Katie and Micah.  Sounds are what made this movie particularly fear-inducing for me.I also think that seen in the context of Paranormal 2 and then 3 (I didn't love 4 as much), the whole package ties it together in ways that answer questions which might nag at the viewer. However, I still think the film stands on its own without the others to make it complete.Finally, because this movie was made of ""found-footage,"" (though again not the shaky, dizzying kind) it made it seem much more real and the possibility that this could happen in my bedroom made it all the more frightening.If you're into fast moving plots and need a continuous jolt of scare throughout a film, this might not be your thing.

This was a pretty creepy movie that worked for me. Of course, you can surmise actions the characters might have or should have taken in real life, but I bought into it and loved the suspense. The original reviewer nailed it, it's the unknown suspense that makes it great....a big, gory payoff and/or lot's of typcial hollywood scare tactics is probably what today's generation of moviegoers want or need but this was crafted well enough that it made it a pretty believeable unfolding story. I most definitely could see a young couple in their position using todays technology (camera, pc,etc) to try and find out something that's been haunting the girl for years. If you really wanted to nitpick, you could wonder why they didn't make a bigger effort to call the girls parents , at least for support or more information and also get many other people involved. Learning that the movie was a real budget affair makes it all the more impressive.

I just can't grasps the idea that a movie with basically no real story or suspense has blown up this big.

If anything I give this movie the credit of having the best marketing campaign and profit probably in the history of movie making. It costs nothing to make almost and it cashed in big. This movie basically sold itself on being hype especially when the found footage stories died out with the Blair Witch which was also another long and boring film of watching people run around with the shaky cam and snot and tears dripping from their noses for 120mins. What's scary about a movie in which the worst thing the ""demon"" does is knock a pot off the shelf or slam a door shut. How is that scary? This films is about maybe 10-20minutes worth of actual horror worthy footage stretched out and watered down into a 110minute film. How anyone can like this I'll never understand.

The ""what if"" premise was as much a part of the film's terror as the movie itself. Unfortunately, the hype was as artificial as the movie itself: friends of the producers spread rumors on the Internet that The Blair Witch Project was the scariest movie ever.  Sound familiar?So you can understand my skepticism when Paranormal Activity released in a limited number of theaters, practically begging viewers on its web site to ask to see it.  The exclusivity was clearly meant to make people only want to see the movie even more.  Considering the numerous first-time posters on dozens of horror forums proclaiming it ""the scariest movie ever"" and...well, I didn't believe them.I was wrong. Paranormal Activity, about a modern couple trying to survive a demonic haunting, does everything right.* It takes the documentary medium a step further than Blair Witch, primarily used the style to make the film feel raw.  That unfiltered feel is also present in Paranormal Activity, but the film goes beyond that by playing with time stamps.  As the time stamp speeds up or slow down, the producers torque the tension.* Never has a single open bedroom door been so disturbing. It conveys, by being open night after night, a sense of vulnerability, acts as a gateway between worlds, and symbolizes a violation of sanctuary. I couldn't take my eyes off the door the entire movie.* Silence.  Paranormal Activity uses silence to freak out the audience.  Our own fears build and build in the vacuum of sound.  In fact, the silence was so deafening that the sound from the movies playing next door and the clicking of the film projector proved a distraction.  In that regard Paranormal Activity might be even scarier on a small screen.* Whether it's propping up the false bravado of Micah or the dire predictions of The Psychic, there are no heroes here. And when someone a solution is finally identified as being capable of helping...it is tantalizingly out of reach.This movie's plot isn't anything new. The same territory has been covered by The Haunting, Poltergeist, and The Exorcist.

There is nothing scary about this film, it's entertaining enough to keep you watching, but a few noises in the night and a door moving, or sounds played backwards to sound demonic isn't anything but old typical cheap tricks made in every other horror movie of the past. This one is just in a style that is shot on a home camera, so expect a Blair Witch type of thing; no music, no soundtrack, no edited footage like a normal movie. However, if you are someone who was scared by the likes of Horror House in 3D then this one may send shivers up your spine. However to an avid horror or thriller movie fan, you know going into this that NOTHING is based on a true story that ever happened in the real world, and know that the stories of this being based on a true story is a marketing scam for it to make money on a low budget film.The visual effects in the movie are nothing special, so don't go in expecting to see some cool things happening and wondering how they did that? It's a very low budget film that was apparently made for about $11,000. The acting however is decent, there is very few actors in the whole movie, but the ones that are in it do a decent job of delivering the story and it's refreshing to see the leading lady isn't a stupid skinny bimbo who got the role cause she starved herself to death.Overall I'm not saying to avoid the movie; I'm just saying, don't get your hopes up too high and believe the hype about it from those who rarely see a scary kind of movie. It's far from being in the top 100, even top 500 scariest movies of all time. It is a far cry from being the scariest movie since Poltergeist, even tho I disagree that one is the scariest of all time either, but for the time being, this is one of those movies that is currently in fashion to see, and it may do well when it's released on DVD, but I am expecting it to be remembered as just one of those films that got parodied to death.

El-Hewie""","[0, 4]","The poor photography, the very limited resources invested in the movie, compounded by the deceptive claim to being a documentary of real people and events, all made the movie a cheap shot. Though this movie was more attended by viewers than other well-produced and narrated movies, I doubt if this one would last long.The whole movie occupies two people, with the exception of few visits of Kate's friend and the psychic. The scenes were very slow, boring, and unreal. The time clock used to convey the sense of duration of actions was excessive and abusive.The worst aspect of the movies was that the viewer does not see the person talking. As if the movie was filmed and acted by only two people, one holding the camera while the other playing the scene. Thus, both the glaring faces and the improper conversational styles made the movie unpleasant. In few scenes, the self filming camera was positioned improperly, truncating the head of the actor, and conveying the sense of sloppinessThough adding the ""paranormal"" twist made a good sell, it failed as a matter of logical explanation of a crime scene. ""Derealization"" would do better. Worse yet was the fact that most of the movie was shot inside the house with the exception of one scene of filming in the outside, beside one in the swimming pool. That does not explain why those two people indulged in such odd preoccupation with the haunted house.The only good thing that might come out of the movie was the display of the  apparent ignorance of the male partner with the extent of mental illness of his girlfriend. The total lack of indifference of Micha towards the clear and evident irrationality of his companion was not an unusual occurrence, since many folks were not trained to distinguish between psychosis and neurosis.",3,Cheap waste,1255996800,"10 20, 2009",2009,1786,"['poor', 'photography', 'very', 'limited', 'resources', 'invested', 'movie', 'compounded', 'deceptive', 'claim', 'being', 'documentary', 'real', 'people', 'events', 'made', 'movie', 'cheap', 'shot', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'attended', 'viewers', 'other', 'well-produced', 'narrated', 'movies', 'doubt', 'one', 'would', 'last', 'long.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'two', 'people', 'exception', 'few', 'visits', 'Kate', 'friend', 'psychic', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'slow', 'boring', 'unreal', 'time', 'clock', 'used', 'convey', 'sense', 'duration', 'actions', 'was', 'excessive', 'abusive.The', 'worst', 'aspect', 'movies', 'was', 'viewer', 'not', 'see', 'person', 'talking', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'acted', 'only', 'two', 'people', 'one', 'holding', 'camera', 'other', 'playing', 'scene', 'Thus', 'glaring', 'improper', 'conversational', 'styles', 'made', 'movie', 'unpleasant', 'few', 'scenes', 'self', 'filming', 'camera', 'was', 'positioned', 'improperly', 'truncating', 'head', 'actor', 'conveying', 'sense', 'sloppinessThough', 'adding', 'paranormal', 'twist', 'made', 'good', 'sell', 'failed', 'matter', 'logical', 'explanation', 'crime', 'scene', 'Derealization', 'would', 'do', 'better', 'Worse', 'yet', 'was', 'fact', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'house', 'exception', 'one', 'scene', 'filming', 'outside', 'beside', 'one', 'swimming', 'pool', 'not', 'explain', 'why', 'two', 'people', 'indulged', 'such', 'odd', 'preoccupation', 'haunted', 'house.The', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'might', 'come', 'movie', 'was', 'display', 'apparent', 'ignorance', 'male', 'partner', 'extent', 'mental', 'illness', 'girlfriend', 'total', 'lack', 'indifference', 'Micha', 'clear', 'evident', 'irrationality', 'companion', 'was', 'not', 'unusual', 'occurrence', 'many', 'folks', 'were', 'not', 'trained', 'distinguish', 'psychosis', 'neurosis']",N/A

I sat down in my seat prepared to jump at least a few times before the end credits, but it only gave me one mild jolt at the very end. That's not say that Paranormal Activity isn't creepy, it really is. It's neat how a few loud noises or a flick of a light switch in the middle of the night (there are a few more elaborate gags than these as the film progresses) creates more tension than any big budget horror film in years. I got goosebumps a couple of times and the less is more approach (whether due the whopping $11,000 budget or not) made it much more unsettling. The Jaws rule of the less you see, the scarier it is, definitely applies here. Comparisons to The Blair Witch Project make sense. They are both horror films, shot dirt cheap (though Blair Witch had twice the budget) and have the same documentary like style. Only in this case, I was happy to find none of those frantic camera movements that made so many people want to hurl leaving the theater back in 1999. The two main cast members are unknown, but they were much better than expected. The dude got on my nerves a little at times and the arguing got tiresome in between the night scares, but they were successful in seeming like real people documenting the paranormal, not actors.Paranormal Activity is slow moving, especially the first half, and it doesn't live up to the hype, but I envy those who just recently heard about this little movie. I saw it with a small crowd and I'm sure it would have been more enjoyable with a packed theater (unless it's full of stupid teens laughing at everything).

1293767,A3CNGVESY19NAU,B002VKE0XA,MovieGeekFeed.com,"[9, 15]","Where to begin, where to begin. My first question is since we voted Paranormal Activity into a wide release in theaters, is there a way that we can vote it out? I haven't felt this let down by a film in a very long time. We're talking let down by epic proportions. I was so completely disappointed, I almost wanted to stand outside the theater door and warn people going in to save their money, don't believe the hype, go trade your ticket in for Zombieland. I can't believe I'm saying this, but wait a week and go see Saw VI. It has too be more entertaining than this.Before I go on, let me get the one good thing about this movie out of the way. It won't take long, believe me. The movie does serve as a warning to people to not mess with the supernatural and occult which, in my opinion, is a very good position to take on the subject. A lot of movies make it look fun to play around with the occult and such, but this is definitely not one of them.Now, on to the rest of the film. I guess I'll just start from the top and move down the list. I may have to abridge some of this since if I actually went into what all is wrong with this movie, I would have to start another website. We begin with the filming technique. The shaky cam is something that was first used as a horror gimmick for film in The Blair Witch Project. This film wishes it was The Blair Witch Project. Never mind the comparisons - it truly WANTS to be that film. I'm over it. Done with the shaky cam crap. I'm tired of leaving the theater feeling like I want to go blow chunks on the director. It was cool the first time. But to keep making movies like this for me to watch is like asking me to keep riding that rollercoaster that I know is going to make me want to barf half-way through it.I don't know why Oren Peli is being praised for this thing. All he did was walk around with a video camera and shoot stuff. There is nothing even remotely artistic about this. You set a camera up in the corner of a room. People get in bed and out of bed. You use some cheap parlor tricks to make doors move and have somebody downstairs banging stuff. Wow. Now that is art. The rest of it is shot like a home movie, just focusing on a room or a certain person.What you get with this film is 20 minutes of footage that has some very quick scares and then 50 minutes of people talking about what's going on. Honestly, I would have felt better and been more entertained if they would have just released the 20 minutes of bed footage and been done with it.Scariest movie ever or of the year? I think not. This entire film is made up of cheap thrills and loud bumps to make you jump. It's like that bad remake or rip-off of The Exorcist you accidentally rented off of Netflix last week. The only people who will be scared from watching this movie are moviegoers who are completely unfamiliar with horror films and do not go see them regularly. I mean real regularly. There's no way if you've watched even two scary movies this year that this thing would get more than a cheap momentary jump out of you.Paramount and everyone involved in this thing has done quite a number on the public. It makes me wonder if this wasn't planned from the very beginning. That it was somehow orchestrated from the get-go. All I can say, I got taken. If you don't feel like you've gotten taken when leaving the theater after seeing this, then they've truly done a number on you. I walked out not believing that renowned websites that I rely on for my movie news have actually been promoting this thing as truly scary and brilliant. Has everyone bought into a big lie? Not me. I do have to applaud Oren Peli, though. He has somehow taken an $11,000 heap of film project and used it to rise to the stature as of being the director of The Blair Witch Project of the 21st century. We saw how well that panned out for the original directors of that film.",2,20 Minutes of Cheap Parlor Tricks and 50 Minutes of Padding,1255737600,"10 17, 2009",2009,3888,"['Where', 'begin', 'where', 'begin', 'first', 'question', 'voted', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'wide', 'release', 'theaters', 'there', 'way', 'can', 'vote', 'out', 'have', ""n't"", 'felt', 'let', 'down', 'film', 'very', 'long', 'time', ""'re"", 'talking', 'let', 'down', 'epic', 'proportions', 'was', 'so', 'completely', 'disappointed', 'almost', 'wanted', 'stand', 'theater', 'door', 'warn', 'people', 'going', 'save', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'hype', 'go', 'trade', 'ticket', 'Zombieland', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'saying', 'wait', 'week', 'go', 'see', 'Saw', 'VI', 'too', 'be', 'more', 'entertaining', 'this.Before', 'go', 'let', 'get', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'believe', 'movie', 'serve', 'warning', 'people', 'not', 'mess', 'supernatural', 'occult', 'opinion', 'very', 'good', 'position', 'take', 'subject', 'lot', 'movies', 'make', 'look', 'fun', 'play', 'around', 'occult', 'such', 'definitely', 'not', 'one', 'them.Now', 'rest', 'film', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'just', 'start', 'top', 'move', 'down', 'list', 'may', 'have', 'abridge', 'actually', 'went', 'what', 'wrong', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'start', 'website', 'begin', 'filming', 'technique', 'shaky', 'cam', 'something', 'was', 'first', 'used', 'horror', 'gimmick', 'film', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'film', 'was', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Never', 'mind', 'comparisons', 'truly', 'WANTS', 'be', 'film', ""'m"", 'Done', 'shaky', 'cam', 'crap', ""'m"", 'tired', 'leaving', 'theater', 'feeling', 'want', 'go', 'blow', 'chunks', 'director', 'was', 'cool', 'first', 'time', 'keep', 'making', 'movies', 'watch', 'asking', 'keep', 'riding', 'rollercoaster', 'know', 'going', 'make', 'want', 'barf', 'half-way', 'it.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Oren', 'Peli', 'being', 'praised', 'thing', 'did', 'was', 'walk', 'video', 'camera', 'shoot', 'stuff', 'nothing', 'even', 'remotely', 'artistic', 'set', 'camera', 'up', 'corner', 'room', 'People', 'get', 'bed', 'bed', 'use', 'cheap', 'parlor', 'tricks', 'make', 'doors', 'move', 'have', 'somebody', 'downstairs', 'banging', 'stuff', 'Wow', 'Now', 'art', 'rest', 'shot', 'home', 'movie', 'just', 'focusing', 'room', 'certain', 'person.What', 'get', 'film', '20', 'minutes', 'footage', 'very', 'quick', 'scares', 'then', '50', 'minutes', 'people', 'talking', 'what', 'going', 'Honestly', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'better', 'been', 'more', 'entertained', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'released', '20', 'minutes', 'bed', 'footage', 'been', 'done', 'it.Scariest', 'movie', 'ever', 'year', 'think', 'not', 'entire', 'film', 'made', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'loud', 'bumps', 'make', 'jump', 'bad', 'remake', 'rip-off', 'Exorcist', 'accidentally', 'rented', 'Netflix', 'last', 'week', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'scared', 'watching', 'movie', 'are', 'moviegoers', 'who', 'are', 'completely', 'unfamiliar', 'horror', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'see', 'regularly', 'mean', 'real', 'regularly', 'way', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'even', 'two', 'scary', 'movies', 'year', 'thing', 'would', 'get', 'more', 'cheap', 'momentary', 'jump', 'you.Paramount', 'everyone', 'involved', 'thing', 'done', 'quite', 'number', 'public', 'wonder', 'was', ""n't"", 'planned', 'very', 'beginning', 'was', 'somehow', 'orchestrated', 'get-go', 'can', 'say', 'got', 'taken', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'taken', 'when', 'leaving', 'theater', 'seeing', 'then', ""'ve"", 'truly', 'done', 'number', 'walked', 'out', 'not', 'believing', 'renowned', 'websites', 'rely', 'movie', 'news', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'promoting', 'thing', 'truly', 'scary', 'brilliant', 'Has', 'everyone', 'bought', 'big', 'lie', 'Not', 'do', 'have', 'applaud', 'Oren', 'Peli', 'though', 'somehow', 'taken', '11,000', 'heap', 'film', 'project', 'used', 'rise', 'stature', 'being', 'director', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', '21st', 'century', 'saw', 'how', 'well', 'panned', 'out', 'original', 'directors', 'film']",N/A

The movie itself is far from scary, but the scary part is that millions of people fell for the media hype. It just goes to show just how gulible, we as Americans are, to believe just about anything we are told without forming our own opinion. Whatever the media says about movies, music, world events, we believe it to be fact. That's sad. Just because a bunch of media critics claim this work to be one of the scariest movies ever, we all fell for it and went stampeding to buy it or pay outrageous money at a theater. I bought it new at $20, and I feel ripped off.Why do I feel ripped off? Because I thought I was going to watch a movie and be scared out of my $20 wits, only to find a movie with only $1 worth of medeocre chills and a script full of issues.  I was expecting more of a ghost hunting type story, but instead we get another exorcism/ possesion piece of drivel.This story of the movie is told through a camcorder. But not very well. This movie has been hyped to be likeThe Blair Witch Projectbut it really isn't. Where the Blair Witch sucessfully created an impending atmosphere of doom, PA fails. I really didn't care for the charaters in this movie. I liked them, but I didn't really care what happened to them. There are long periods of, well, bad acting, between the interesting parts. I sat forward in my chair expecting to have a huge scare, but what happened was only typical of other horro movies, and left me wondering what all the hype was about.The story leaves alot of unanswered questions. They discover another similar woman who died from a similar situation. Ok...but how and why? The lead states that she has always had this phatom about her...ok...why?

Durham ""Big Evil""","[2, 6]","Though it doesn't quite live up to the spectacular degree of hype that was built around it, Paranormal Activity is regardless a truly frightening film that delivers the goods.  Created and directed by newcomer Oren Peli, Paranormal Activity gives viewers the bird's eye view (or in this case that of a handheld camera) into the supernatural happenings in the home of a young couple (Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat) who are being terrorized by a destructive, demonic spirit.  At first, the only activity is a moving door or moved car keys, but it isn't long before things escalate on a very dangerous scale.  There are definite ""jump"" moments to be had, but as the film reaches its closing stretch, the events become truly terrifying, and it's made all the more so thanks to Peli's POV-style presentation.  True, the whole POV thing has been done to death since The Blair Witch Project and everything to come after it, but here, it actually feels kind of fresh to a degree.  The fact that so many fans demanded the release of the film become more widespread (so much so that it even toppled the latest installment of the Saw franchise) is a testament as to how one can do a lot with a little, and the film as a whole is also a testament that one does not need to rely on buckets of blood, guts, and torture to truly get under an audience's skin.

The concept has been done to death, and this film is no different than any other of its kind. Paranormal Activity, to put it bluntly is a rip-off of the Blair Witch Project, only filmed inside a house.The film is shot in black & white, uses shaky hand-held-camera throughout except for when the couple is sleeping. The film is poorly acted (yes, I realize these are nobody actors, but I've better school acting) and veryunbelivable and equally poorly shot. There was zero script and storyline directly lifted from any paranormal documentary found on television. Oren Peli should be smacked for giving himself the title of director/writer because neither of these existed in this *cough* film.The best part of Paranormal Activity is that I laughed at it and its core audience for shelling out enough green for the studio to make another one (which, I hear is better but I doubt it).Here is why I gave the movie 2 stars. 1) Micah Sloat was enjoyable to listen to when he made fun of Katie Featherston's character because she  acted like an idiot. If you are having that serious of an issue you move regardless of what your spouse or anyone says, and 2) the loud noises,  i.e. banging were at times scary, however most were expected & fell flat.Lastly, the ending without giving it away was terrible.

Sorry, but an invisible entity making some thumping noises, moving a door, and turning on and off some lights, isn't particularly scary to me.  There was a point where I felt the movie might have taken a turn for the truly creepy, when the psychic first came in and reviewed Katie's history with the entity going back to her early childhood, and discussed the difference between ghosts and demons.  Building upon *that*, and exploring why the ""demon"" chose her and followed her all these years, and doing more than just banging on the walls, might have made this a truly classic horror film, albeit one with a slow start.  But they dropped the ball halfway through.  By the time something physical actually *happened,* I no longer really cared.  Even the ending, supposedly ""shocking,"" just elicited a shrug from me.  The DVD I saw had an alternate ending, but no scene-selection menu - and yes, I was curious enough to fast-forward through the entire dull-as-dishwater film a second time, in hopes that the alternate ending would redeem itself - but no, it was equally as dull.  I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 for a couple of good moments and because I didn't utterly *hate* it - but I did find it entirely uninspired and disappointing.

1293791,A1WD8PRZ5VQCS0,B002VKE0XA,Reacher Creature,"[23, 36]","***SOME SPOILERS BELOW***When I heard all of the buzz about this movie, I couldn't wait to rent it. Alls I heard is that this is the scariest movie ever made, and how I'd be scared out of my wits watching it.  This wasn't even close.  I had a lot of problems with it.The first problem that I had was the sound quality. I understand they wanted to film it as if it was being filmed on a handheld (although it was a good sized one) camera.  Unfortunately, that's how it sounded too.  At times, the sound was low and not very clear. Again, I understand why it was filmed that way, but for me it didn't work. Actually, it took away from the movie.The characters of Katie and MIcha were very shallow, and after a while, really grated on my nerves.  They were so flat and didn't have  any depth to them. There was glimmers of depth do Katie, and at times I felt sorry for her, but other times, she was kind of annoying. There wasn't really and progression of any kind to them. Micha was so boring there was nothing to him. At times, Katie grew mad at Micha, and launched a few f-bombs, but then went back to her normal self. I'd have liked to see her get a bit madder as the movie went on. If Katie went from calm to getting angry, then flat out P*issed, would have been interesting to see.  This only happened when the demon possessed her at the end. I felt that was when she was most interesting to watch.This is  very boring movie. Nothing really happens until the last two minutes. That's why I gave it one star instead of zero stars. I actually liked the last couple of minutes. Up until then, **nothing** happens.  Sure, you get a growl, a door will move a bit, a chandelier will shake, keys will be moved, other small things happen, but that's it.  We're talking about a demon here. A demon. Why not push one of them down the steps? Throw one across the room? Have chairs being thrown about? Anything would have been good. I was just waiting for something to happen, and alls we see for a while, a door will move. That's it folks. As the movies goes on, we do seem some interesting things. A door slams, and then knocking, the girl is dragged out of bed and across the floor and then out of the room down the hall, and it possessed Katie. I actually liked that part, and that was at the end. I loved that! The movie should have started off like that, or have that happen sooner.The movie had a Medium, who was very annoying. He said there was a demon in the house.....and this was based on feelings. Not solid evidence, no investigation, nothing, Just a feeling. They could have used the medium and have him do an overnight investigation and have him find something..... anything. But no, he said there was a demon in the house, just on his feelings. The producers and writers missed a golden chance to have fear interjected in the movie.The attic scene bothered me. Again, they could have had something happen when Micha went to the attic. Have something fall, have Micha hear something, or have him see just a pair of eyes looking back at him, but the only thing he finds is a picture. That's it. Again, this was a fantastic scene if they movie makers wanted something scary to happen, but nothing was done, just a pic was found.I did like the very end. When we see Katie stumble out of the room, and go into the downstairs, then we hear blood curdling screams, them Micha wakes up and runs to her and he started screaming (we don't see why, and that really worked for me, loved the scene) then silence..... then we hear heavy footsteps, Micha is thrown into the bedroom, then Kaite stomps slowly in the room covered with blood. Katie then stomps to Micha's body....crawls.... sniffs it, then grins in the camera, and growls, has a horrible demonic grin, and attacks the camera, then it ends. I loved that part!!  That was spooky, eerie, and uncomfortable to watch. I love it! Why couldn't the entire movie be like that?  I would have loved it if the entire movie was as good as that once scene. It's just to bad, that it took sitting through a boring movie to get to that last scene. I also liked how we saw the footprints in the flour, very nice.I understand why the movie makers never showed us the demon. They figure the unseen is worse then the seen, and I agree with that. I loved the Blair Witch Project.  For some reason, in Paranormal Activity, it didn't work. Maybe if they made it more suspenseful by having the demon do more demonic things, it would have worked better than it did.If you want to see it, I'd say go for it. Just don't expect much to happen until the last two minutes.

1293792,A39W3263A9HCMN,B002VKE0XA,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[6, 10]","The movie starts with no studio logos- instead of logos we get a title card from the producers thanking the local Police department and Katie Featherston/Micah Sloat's parents thanking them for the footage. From that point, you know you are going to see some amateur footage from Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat, investigating a series of paranormal occurrences in their home involving an unwelcome presence of a Demon.Paranormal Activity was made in 2006 on a budget of $15,000 by Oren Pireli. It was his debut movie and was shot in 10 days. It didn't get any screenings until 2007, and Steven Spielberg had been given a DVD screener to watch. He apparently got so scared that he couldn't watch the whole movie. However, nonetheless he enjoyed it and ended up finishing it.I saw the screener copy that has been floating around the internet this past halloween, and invited a friend over. The movie made for some creepy fun, and I can guarantee you that this may be the creepiest movie I've seen, and certinaly the most intense movie I've seen in a while!The first 10 minutes may bore you a little, as before we get to the creepshow, we get a bit of an introduction to Kaitie and Micah's life. The first time we see the ""in the bedroom"" shot, it's basically a demo of what we're about to see. After an encounter with a psychic, which offers some interesting insight into Katie's child life and history of being haunted by this presence, we then skip right into the night time scenes. Once the nighttime scenes come, you immediately are on the edge of your seat and unsure of what will happen. My favorite one was the moment the footsteps get louder and louder and the door shuts- a classic creepy moment. THe whole movie is intense, and about 3/4 of the way through, I was unsure if I could watch it anymore, it was so scary!One thing the cut I saw is known for is its ending, which was changed for it's theatrical release by Steven Spielberg. I cannot see why he chose to do that- the ending, in my opinion, is one of the greatest endings ever filmed- extremely morbid, hopeless, devastating, and it stays with you. No such horror movie ending has been THAT effective.I can see why people hated this movie, as it's not a real jumpy or gory or violent movie. There is zero violence in this movie, with the exception of a gunshot and the implication that someone has died. THere is no gore either, something I really liked. This is the scary that Hitchcock is famous for- intense, brooding, PARANORMAL. It's scary because of what little there is. My dad, who never gets scared, couldn't enjoy it because of how terrifying it was. Hitchcock would be proud of Pireli, and I'm glad this movie has been a huge, worldwide sensation... that said, this is one of the best, and most underrated horror movies ever made.In short, if you are a hyper kid who needs tons of jump moments, gore, and ultra-violence, avoid this. This movie is for people who are patient people who let things come when they will, and for thinkers. And because I am one of those, this movie scared the bejeezus out of me. Kudos to Pireli for great direction, and kudos to Sloat and Featherston for their great performances.TOTAL:Entertainment: 9/10Sex: Katie Featherston/10Violence: 0.5/10Creep Factor: 10++++++++++/10Will you be able to sleep after watching this?

No one ran from the theatre unable to witness anymore.  Instead there were laughs throughout the entire film coming from the whole audience.  And they weren't laughs to cover deeper fears. The sad and simply fact is that this is NOT a scarey movie at all!The plot is trite, the actors obvious amateurs, the jolting scenes of terror are no more thrilling than going to a live Halloween scare-show and having a constumed employee jump out at you.Hype has elevated this film higher than the recent Balloon Boy's hoaxed lift.  (There is even a scene in this film involving an attic crawlspace:  I hope law enforcement checks out to see if Richard Henne and his family saw this movie and got their idea for the hideout for Falcon and the hoax notion from it, as the film is prefaced with a caption indicating it is a true story - which it is not - just as the UFO balloon story was bogus.)Don't fall for it:  Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"" is 100 times spookier and scarey than this cinema verite garbage. The original ""Carnival of Souls"" is 100 times spookier and scarier. There are hundreds of  movies scarier than this - primarily because this movie just ain't scarey!

But this is a pretty creepy movie regardless of those negative reviews and the Blair Witch-type-""filmed on a camcorder"" faux reality approach to the production. In fact, that production style works better with this film than it did in Blair Witch (which I think is very much over-rated).  Who hasn't at some point in their life felt frightened lying in bed at night and hearing a noise in another room in the house, especially if that noise is coming from downstairs?  This movie excels at exploring that fear and the ""reality""-camcorder style really brings that fear into better focus - it gave me the willies especially in the last 20 minutes or so.

There are many, many flaws in it...but its goal is to give the viewer the willies, and it succeeds.  I seldom (and I DO MEAN seldom) notice my heart racing faster and find that I'm leaning forward in my seat when watching a movie.  I've seen it all, I feel like.PARANORMAL ACTIVITY was a delightful exception.  I found it truly disturbing and agitating.  I actually felt dread.  The kind of feeling little kids get when watching a horror movie...the feeling of  having been shown another world that is really an awful place, and of not quite being able to separate it from reality.  While I never truly believed I was watching a true story...something about the film gave me genuine goosebumps.In case you don't know, this is one of those ""found"" home videos that essentially shows how one couple who are being haunted used their camcorder to document the events.  The key moments come in the night, with the camera set at one end of the couple's bedroom, focused on their bed and the door leading into their room from the upstairs landing and hallway.  That's about it.  Katie & Micah are the couple, and aside from brief appearances by two minor characters, they are IT.  The whole thing was shot in a normal suburban house.  It was made VERY cheaply indeed.  (Yes, it is actually fiction...just like BLAIR WITCH.)We saw it the night it opened in our city, and I can say that in the packed house, there were genuine screams of fright.  Most times we see a horror movie these days, the theatre is packed with teenagers who scream mostly to try to scare other members of their group or to elicit a laugh from the crowd.  There was some of that early on...but as the film developed a true silence fell over the crowd.  And it was only broken on occasion by screams that were NOT there to illicit laughs...they were genuine bursts of terror.  The experience made me fully realize how seldom we actually see genuinely scary stuff.The thing that frustrates me (and is probably the reason I've waited so long to post a review), is that I honestly can't really explain why the movie works.  I seldom lack for an opinion and for support of that opinion...but I must scratch my head here.The actors, also named Katie and Micah, are not actually all that great.  I assume they improvised much of their dialogue, and it has the feel of almost, but not quite, ""normal"" conversation.  Once in awhile, we have to wonder exactly WHY a character is insisting on carrying a camcorder with them...would you worry much about it if  you thought an evil entity was in your attic?  And it feels, on the surface, like a big gimmick.Is it the fact that we can all relate to an ordinary suburban American house?  It may not look like our homes, but for most of us, it is in the ballpark.  Is it the idea of a ghost (or worse) coming into our bedrooms and crawling into bed with us as we sleep?  (Yes, that IS creepy, but why does it WORK so well in this film?)  Is it the fact that Micah and especially Katie look like real people, not stars (Katie is a perfectly normal woman who in comparison to the movie stars we see, looks positively pudgy)?  I'm simply not sure.  The execution seems far too simple.  It's not as though the director has used gadgetry or tricks.  Perhaps the lack of those tricks we so often see allows us to avoid the arms length feeling we get from glossier films.I don't know, and I'm frankly tired of trying to figure it out.  I suspect the film will not play as well at home, unless you can get a crowd over and turn out all your lights.  It probably wouldn't hold up too well on repeat viewings, either.  But for me, it was truly, chillingly effective, and thus I have to give it very high marks indeed.",5,Fully accomplishes what it sets out to do...SCARE.,1261094400,"12 18, 2009",2009,3815,"['terms', 'movie', 'accomplishing', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'may', 'be', 'movie', 'year', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'flaws', 'goal', 'give', 'viewer', 'willies', 'seldom', 'DO', 'MEAN', 'seldom', 'notice', 'heart', 'racing', 'faster', 'find', ""'m"", 'leaning', 'forward', 'seat', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'feel', 'like.PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'was', 'delightful', 'exception', 'found', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'agitating', 'actually', 'felt', 'dread', 'kind', 'feeling', 'little', 'kids', 'get', 'when', 'watching', 'horror', 'movie', 'feeling', 'having', 'been', 'shown', 'world', 'really', 'awful', 'place', 'not', 'quite', 'being', 'able', 'separate', 'reality', 'never', 'truly', 'believed', 'was', 'watching', 'true', 'story', 'something', 'film', 'gave', 'genuine', 'goosebumps.In', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'found', 'home', 'videos', 'essentially', 'how', 'one', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'haunted', 'used', 'camcorder', 'document', 'events', 'key', 'moments', 'come', 'night', 'camera', 'set', 'one', 'end', 'couple', 'bedroom', 'focused', 'bed', 'door', 'leading', 'room', 'upstairs', 'landing', 'hallway', 'Katie', 'Micah', 'are', 'couple', 'aside', 'brief', 'appearances', 'two', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'IT', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'shot', 'normal', 'suburban', 'house', 'was', 'made', 'VERY', 'cheaply', 'indeed', 'Yes', 'actually', 'fiction', 'just', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'saw', 'night', 'opened', 'city', 'can', 'say', 'packed', 'house', 'were', 'genuine', 'screams', 'fright', 'Most', 'times', 'see', 'horror', 'movie', 'days', 'theatre', 'packed', 'teenagers', 'who', 'scream', 'mostly', 'try', 'scare', 'other', 'members', 'group', 'elicit', 'laugh', 'crowd', 'was', 'early', 'film', 'developed', 'true', 'silence', 'fell', 'crowd', 'was', 'only', 'broken', 'occasion', 'screams', 'were', 'NOT', 'there', 'illicit', 'laughs', 'were', 'genuine', 'bursts', 'terror', 'experience', 'made', 'fully', 'realize', 'how', 'seldom', 'actually', 'see', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'stuff.The', 'thing', 'probably', 'reason', ""'ve"", 'waited', 'so', 'long', 'post', 'review', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'why', 'movie', 'seldom', 'lack', 'opinion', 'support', 'opinion', 'must', 'scratch', 'head', 'here.The', 'actors', 'also', 'named', 'Katie', 'Micah', 'are', 'not', 'actually', 'great', 'assume', 'improvised', 'much', 'dialogue', 'feel', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'normal', 'conversation', 'Once', 'awhile', 'have', 'wonder', 'exactly', 'WHY', 'character', 'insisting', 'carrying', 'camcorder', 'would', 'worry', 'much', 'thought', 'evil', 'entity', 'was', 'attic', 'surface', 'big', 'gimmick.Is', 'fact', 'can', 'relate', 'ordinary', 'suburban', 'American', 'house', 'may', 'not', 'look', 'homes', 'most', 'ballpark', 'idea', 'ghost', 'worse', 'coming', 'bedrooms', 'crawling', 'bed', 'sleep', 'Yes', 'IS', 'creepy', 'why', 'WORK', 'so', 'well', 'film', 'fact', 'Micah', 'especially', 'Katie', 'look', 'real', 'people', 'not', 'stars', 'Katie', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'woman', 'who', 'comparison', 'movie', 'see', 'positively', 'pudgy', ""'m"", 'simply', 'not', 'sure', 'execution', 'far', 'too', 'simple', 'not', 'director', 'used', 'gadgetry', 'tricks', 'Perhaps', 'lack', 'tricks', 'so', 'often', 'see', 'avoid', 'arms', 'length', 'feeling', 'get', 'glossier', 'films.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'frankly', 'tired', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'suspect', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'play', 'as', 'well', 'home', 'can', 'get', 'crowd', 'turn', 'out', 'lights', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'too', 'well', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'either', 'was', 'truly', 'chillingly', 'effective', 'thus', 'have', 'give', 'very', 'high', 'marks', 'indeed']",N/A

A couple who recently moved into a starter home talk about being haunted, consult a parapsychologist, tape their daily lives. Yeah, we get the occasional odd noise or whatever, but let's face it, 99% of supposed ""hauntings"" come from errant breezes slamming doors or clanking in the pipes. You start wondering whether there really is a haunting to be had here, despite the viral marketing campaign that made this this #1 movie on its opening weekend.By now, of course, you know that it was also the #1 movie on its second weekend. Marketing doesn't do that by itself. Fifty-two minutes into Paranormal Activity, things get honest-to-god scary. First-time filmmaker Oren Peli uses all the banality he built up in the first half of the movie very well by throwing it back in our faces. Man, I hope his second movie is a family drama/chick flick kind of thing. Imagine what he could do with that. Because Paranormal Activity is the flat-out scariest movie to hit theaters in a decade. Maybe more. Why? Because Peli understands the concept that what happens off the screen is scarier than what happens on the screen, and he uses it, Val Lewton-like, to make us curl up into the fetal position and rock back and forth in our seats imagining what's going on. (Note: this is a good time to mention that at least three endings were filmed for this movie. Oddly, it was actually released in three different versions simultaneously. If the Val Lewton-ness of the picture breaks in the final ten minutes, find another theater, or rent it on DVD when you can. There's one perfect ending. If you saw it, you know it.)As well, this is a scary movie because it's very well-written. You get to know and care about these characters. This is a very good thing considering the bulk of the movie is a two-person flick (and I have documented my affinity for the two-person flick in a number of past reviews). It takes above-average writing and acting to pull off the two-person movie, and Peli, helped out by Katie Featherston (Mutation) and Micah Sloat (in his first acting job), delivers in spades.Simple, solid, and scary.

The scares are there for those who want to be scared, but it does not drag you in, and unless you are in the mood, it probably will not scare you, whatever happens.The concept is cool, but the filming looks staged rather than spontaneous true caught on tape photography we would hope. The major downfall is the lame ending, as if they didn't know how to end it, but give it one last bang by ultimate violence.

It is about a young couple living together in a home who are menaced by some kind of ghostly being or thing.  Turns out that this thing has followed the young lady around all of her life.  The entire film takes place in their home, mostly in the bedroom at night.  There is some imaginative film making here, but this is only an average film.  We learn almost nothing about the couple, their lives, or anything much except for how this thing haunts them.  In other words there is not much of a plot the way there is, for example, in the film ""Poltergeist.""  There are some scary parts, but nothing exceptional.  This is not the kind of film likely to keep anyone awake at night.I think that part of my frustration with this film is my notion that it could have been much better.

I live on the intersection of Nowhere and Too Late, quite a ways from the next neighbor.  One calm, windless night, while working in our big garage around 3 a.m., I listened with a certain hair-raising thrill as the east sliding bay door made a repeated rapping sound.  No wind, mind you, not a blade of grass stirring and the right bay door perfectly still and silent.  I looked around and saw nothing.Beats me what it was.  Maybe a big spectral rat was digging under the sill plate.  ""Paranormal Activity"" was this kind of movie, where you don't see the beastie, only its effects.  The show was somewhat spooky, but truth be told, the ""Blair Witch Project"" stole its thunder.  You knew this wasn't real, and there's something about ""Activity's"" setting in a modern, spacious house that just wasn't as chilling as being lost in the dark woods with some kind of supernatural critter on the loose.Another truer note from ""Blair Witch"" was that the kids were trying to get away.  The young couple in ""Activity"", however, particularly the moron boyfriend, insisted on staying in the house until the end.  Sure, they were told that the demon would follow them.  But I'd have burned rubber getting out of the house anyway, if only to shake the demon for a day or two.On the other hand, although the boyfriend was pigheaded about staying, turning down help, and ultimately leading them to disaster, he did stick around when it was clear that the demon was only interested in his girlfriend.  How many guys would care enough about their girlfriends to tell Beelzebub to take a hike?The movie worked fairly well, then, but not extraordinarily so.  The girl's being dragged out of bed by an invisible force was effectively scary, but both endings to the show were out of sync with the approach of the whole show previously.  Especially the main ending, which made a sort of manifestation of the demon in an unlikely way.What sticks with me is how eerily similar the noise the demon made when it was haunting the couple's bedroom to the sound long freight trains sometimes make out here, some five miles away, on a quiet summer's night.

What's scarier, for instance, than watching video playback of your girlfriend standing in the middle of the bedroom at 3 a.m. -- just standing there, and nothing else -- as you sleep soundly? Or seeing her sneak off in the middle of the night to sit alone on the porch swing on a chilly California night, once again well past midnight. The events in ""Paranormal"" get eerier and more disturbing as the movie moves along at a brisk clip. This poor couple can't escape the malicious presence that terrorizes in both subtle and overt ways: persistently loud thuds and odd noises; a disconcerting hum whenever evil is in the room; a swinging chandelier after a particularly harrowing episode; a wisp of wind that snakes under the covers in the stark of night, infiltrating its target with ease. Who wouldn't be driven over the edge by this stuff? It doesn't help that the cocky camera keeper eggs the demon on at times.Arguments abound as the couple struggles for solutions.

1293816,ABBYHOP59TRZF,B002VKE0XA,Sara,"[2, 3]","First, let me say that what goes on in this movie is very much like a real haunting, but you can see this info on Ghost Hunters and other TV shows. That makes this movie nothing special. I've personally experienced water turning on by itself, lights coming on and off by themselves, sounds of drawers opening and closing, doors opening and closing, objects moving around the room, the bed shaking, scratching noises in the walls, whispers, and footsteps in the attic.  I've also awakened to find my eyes have been open for hours and, when I was little, I would walk in my sleep occasionally. Most of these occurrences, I can chalk up to the same conclusion I had regarding this movie--psychokinetic energy. It is very similar to poltergeist activity, only the energy comes from you.The main characters decide to move in with each other. The woman having previously been aware of some unusual haunting-like behavior having gone on around her, warns her boyfriend of this unsafe possibility. He is fascinated and buys a video camera to see if they can catch activity on tape. Various bumps in the night occur, generally while she is sleeping. They do contact a psychic, who is too afraid to deal with the problem.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[3, 5]","If you've seen ""Paranormal Activity 2"" and think it's wack, please don't judge this movie with the same standard. The first one is far better than the sequel, and I wish the movie creators would've left it at this movie. Basically the movie is about an evil spirit in the house. Throw in a video camera and a couple who just moved in and a mysterious childhood photo that shows up in the attic completely out of nowhere. The couple is pretty stable, but they're noticing random things happening that just aren't right, specifically the woman. The great thing about ""Paranormal Activity"" is you don't see the ""monster"" and there's not a whole lot of blood and gore. Your imagination is what will mess you up after you leave this movie. My father, who is just about NEVER scared of any horror movie, still talks about how creepy that scream was, and it really was the kind of scream you remember. The best part though was almost all of the creepy stuff happened in the bedroom. Normally when you go to sleep at night, this is the one place you go to get away from creepy thoughts (okay, outside of ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies). But in this movie, everything happened in the bedroom. I left the theater and barely wanted to sleep in my own bed for fear I'd be yanked out.This was one VERY good movie, and the end made my father drop his head. We were both very relieved that we don't have rocking chairs on our porches. I laughed because I was so surprised that it got to him and me both (I'm another person who usually just watches horror movies like comedies). My mother thought this film was lame, but it really got to my father and I.

Instead of slumbering comfortably in my king size bed, I am sitting at my computer with the house awash in lights: I have just returned from a midnight screening of Paranormal Activity. It will be awhile before I dare sleep again...Katie and Micah are a young couple who have just moved in together. During the nights, Katie is plagued by nightmares and experiences a general feeling of dread; something that has been happening to her on and off since the age of eight. To ease his girlfriend's discomfort, but mainly to satisfy his own selfish curiosity and prove he is the alpha creature in the house, Micah procures a camera and begins to record their bedroom as they sleep. He also documents their daily conversations and frequent bickering about the unwanted guest. Is it a ghost, a demon, or the pervy kid next door? Whatever/whoever is after Katie, does not appreciate Micah's attempts at taking charge. Slowly, things begin to... take shape...Paranormal Activity is the best case of BOO!'s I have experienced in a movie theater in over a decade.  With only a few brilliantly placed bumps, groans and innuendoes, the simple story fuels your own imagination to the point you are roasting in fear and tension. The entire film is shot with a hand held camera inside one house. Thankfully, there is little ""shakiness"", as the camera is either secured on a tripod or resting on a surface. Of the four actors involved, two appear on screen for mere minutes. All this adds to the viewer's feeling of isolation, entrapment and inescapable doom, fully justified by the ensuing events... Five star entertainment, no doubt! With that said, I believe this film is best appreciated at night, on a large screen, with a group of viewers (to feed of each others fears). I will be curious to see how it does on DVD. The action develops VERY slowly (purposefully so). If you have ADD, this may not be a film for you.PS: I think by now, most know Paranormal Activity was made on a budget of $15,000.

Is it correct?  Not quite, but the film still offers its own fair share of scares and thrills.  The film begins by showing the audience the basic daily lives of the two main (and basically only) actors of the film.  The audience is told that the couple has been experiencing a lot of night terrors recently, ranging from crashes and bumps, to more drastic and major events as well. To finally put an end to this, Micah decides to capture every moment of their daily lives on video.  He begins to carry around a camera in hopes of catching the haunting in action.The audience sees Micha's and Katie's lives in real-time as events are actually occurring.  The real thrills don't begin until the night scenes however.  During the night, Micha places the camera on a tripod in the corner of the room.  During the first few nights the audience is treated to thumps, crashes, doors opening on their own, and lights flickering.  The hauntings become worse with each night and as the hours progress.  Micha begins to infuriate the spirit even further through his constant provoking actions.  This makes the audience feel tense as to how the spirit will act, especially since the events are occurring in real-time.  The angrier the spirit gets, the more violent the hauntings become, even leading to eventual day-time hauntings.  What was once simple ""bumps"" and other noises transform into violent attacks against the couple.  A simple poltergeist reveals itself as a demon.The camera is always placed in the perfect corner of the room, allowing the audience to view footprints, shadows, and other events as they occur.  What adds to the suspense is the fact that the spirit gradually becomes worse as time goes by.  The pacing is done extremely well, building suspense with each passing night.  This contributes greatly to the overall scare factor of the film.  The last few nights of the film are filled with so much suspense and terror that the build up going into the scenes alone is enough to justify chills.

Netflix kept telling me that there was a ""long wait"" for this movie that was only getting average at best reviews. So everybody wants to see it, but it is being reviewed poorly? It must be better than everyone is saying, right? Maybe people are writing bad reviews because it really scared them and they don't want to admit it?Well it finally arrived at my house this week, and after watching I have to join the average at best chorus. It's one of those ""found footage handheld camera movies"" that's actually pretty effective for its genre. There are some genuinely creepy moments and if you watch it alone late at night it's even more effective. But overall I thought it was unrealistic and too long even though the theatrical version comes in at under 90 minutes.I think that it was Eddie Murphy in one of his early comedy routines that mocked the family in The Amityville Horror for staying in the house even though at one point in that movie a message from beyond cries out ""GET OUT"". A smart family would indeed get out! Well it's kinda the same in Paranormal Activity, except the concept is that the person is haunted versus the house. Okay...so GET OUT...of the relationship then!The biggest problem with Paranormal Activity is that it should have been a half hour long, but unfortunately theTales from the Crypt-esqueformat for that doesn't really exist at the moment. But, kudos to first time Director Oren Peli for making a reported 200 million bucks on a reported 15 grand investment.The movie has an R rating and I'm not sure why; there was really no gore and if there were bad words I don't recall anything above a PG-13 level. I understand that one of the alternate endings is a bit more gruesome than the theatrical version, so maybe that's it (I only watched the theatrical version).No need to buy this movie.

No other explanation was offered.)  Then there's the implied 24-7 filming of everything that occurred in the house, but the video timestamp was present only half the time.  To top it all off he closing scene was...well...dumb.  Whatever.  Still a decent film in all rights, though certainly NOT a high paced exciting one.

1293835,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B002VKE0XA,S. Schell,"[2, 4]","I love watching a scary movie, even if it has me looking over my shoulder and/or conjuring shadows in a room that aren't really there.  As I've gotten older it's become more difficult for movies to scare me like they used to and though my imagination hasn't diminished, what it has become is more realistic, skeptical and analytical.  That being said, ""Paranormal Activity"" did not have me curling into a ball and peeking between my fingers with apprehension, but it did evoke a palpable sense of disquiet with its simplistic setting and a plausible approach to the supernatural that shrewdly preys on the uncertainties and persuasions of God-fearing individuals.The film is presented as a documentary (it has no beginning or end credits) and takes the same approach that ""The Blair Witch Project"" did, director Oren Peli touting it as a true story.  He sets the stage succinctly with a young and typical cohabiting couple who have been experiencing minor but consistent paranormal activity in their home over an unspecified period of time.  They mutually decide to start documenting the goings-on via video and audio and what they capture both captivates and frightens them.  From the beginning it is made clear that this haunting is not an isolated incident - Katie (Featherston) has been followed by this entity ever since she was eight years old and her boyfriend Micah (Sloat) finds this out for the first time when a psychic makes a visit and informs both of them that the presence in their home is demonic in nature.While Katie is naturally passive and errs on the side of caution, Micah is impetuous and begins addressing the entity directly, taunting it and even bringing a Ouija board into the home to initiate open communication (much to Katie's consternation and against the advice of the psychic).  The activity then grows from mere thumps and scrapes in the wee hours to unnerving breezes, moving objects and physical attacks.  In no time at all, Micah and Katie are frightened and cranky from sleep-deprivation, their mutual fear and anxiety causing constant dissension and feeding the entity's appetite for negative energy.By the time this mockumentary reaches its end, you'll probably be sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for a grand finale that will leave you breathless and satisfied.  What you'll more than likely get is something akin to a drunken orgasm - you know a climax occurred at some point from that shiver you just felt but for some reason you're still holding your breath waiting for the big one.Don't get me wrong - ""Paranormal Activity"" contains a good amount of well-executed scares and though I was literally leaning forward at times, squinting at the shadows in Micah and Katie's bedroom, my heart pounding with equal amounts of anticipation and dread, I wasn't ever brought to the point where I jumped out of my skin with fright.  And don't expect to see what's responsible for the terror - much like the aforementioned ""Blair Witch"", this film forces the audience to use their imaginations in order to conjure something menacing rather than create a computerized imp that would likely incite scathing criticism and/or disappointment.  Despite its failure to scare the bejesus out of me, it still greatly played on personal fears and superstitions of mine (I wouldn't ever mess with a Ouija board - bad joojoo, people), particularly the prospect of demonic possession.  To me, nothing is scarier than losing myself to something I can't understand or control, much less see.A first time filmmaker, Peli really broke the bank with this one.  Filmed for $15K (which overextended his intended budget of $10K) in his own home in a little over a week, ""Paranormal Activity"" raked in almost $142 million when all was said and done.  Peli's personal website, which invited users to ""demand"" the film at other venues via [...]. (it started out in only 12 theaters in September of '09), proved to be an innovative marketing tool and when the counter hit over 1 million requests, Paramount granted the film a wide domestic release.  The result?  A word-of-mouth success story.Bottom line: I'm not inviting you to go with the hype on this one but I'm not telling you to ignore it entirely either.  ""Paranormal Activity"" generated the buzz that it did for good reason.  If you don't mind a film that will keep you up late wondering about every creak and bump you hear in your house, then by all means, go for it.  If you can't tolerate scary movies that take a realistic approach about paranormal phenomenon, you'd better take a pass on this one, lest you end up hiding like a child beneath the covers in your darkened bedroom, holding your breath and counting with trepidation the hours and minutes until dawn.",4,Scary?

O'Blenis,"[0, 2]","A young couple, Katie and Micah, have been experiencing strange events in their home, but the incidents - bumps in the night, sounds of whipered voices, faucets seeming to turn themselves off and on - are nothing compared to the escalating supernatural events that come after Micah gets it into his head to try and document the phenomena.  He buys a camcorder and a load of film to record events day and night and see just what really goes on in the house when they're asleep.In Blair Witch-style, the entire movie is seen as a compilation of what the camera captured.  Paranormal Activity comes off feeling very real - the performers are extremely natural, never once seeming like they're acting, and none of the effects Look remotely like special effects.  The characterization is in-depth, and it's the characters that make the whole 'recording' scenario seem so plausible.Of the two, it's Katie that doesn't think the recording idea is very smart: it's Katie who's experiencing the supernatural happenings more first hand than Micah (although they both hear bumps and creaks in the night - which could be anything - it's her that hears the whispers) and she's the one who's lived through this before, as she's been periodically visited or haunted, apparantly by the same entity, at various points since childhood.  It starts up, continues for a while, then disappears for years at a stretch.  And it's followed her from place to place, so the activity is obviously centered on her, not on a specific house or place.  With Micah, we have one of those rare cases in storytelling where the tale seems to tell us a lot about a character that the character himself doesn't seem to be aware of.  Micah loves Katie, and is trying to help, but I think that in the early stages his state of mind - albeit not consciously - is kind of ""this can't Really be happening.  We'll find there's some rational explanation or not, but in the end we'll just laugh about it.  But you know, wouldn't it be kind of cool if there really Was something?""  I  don't think that in the early days of his experiments with recording events he's ever able to genuinely perceive this 'haunting' as a threat; therefore he doesn't think he's putting Katie or himself in danger when he takes actions that he's been warned aren't wise, that could provoke the entity and make things worse.Things do go from bad to worse, and it gets increasingly difficult to think of a 'rational' explanation for the increasing activity.  Katie's strong fears from the start and her inclination that they should just ride it out rather than try to understand it, perhaps indicate an intuitive sense of just how dangerous the entity they're dealing with really is, or perhaps indicate that she's glimpsed more during previous incidents of activity than she's letting on.  She does Not believe they can 'defeat' this being, and thinks that the best thing they can do is ignore it and it will do what it's always done before when ignored: eventually go away.  Micah becomes obsessed with understanding it, and by the time he has to admit that the threat is extremely real, he can't back off.  He seems to think that he'd be letting Katie down if he stopped (even though that's what she wants him to do), or perhaps thinks that he'd be less manly if he were to admit he was on the wrong track.  Again, he doesn't necesarily think these things consciously, and that may go for Katie too, but that's the interpretation I got of their motivations.  And so, even as things get worse, the recording continues, and Micah continues trying to capture evidence on film, alternately trying to communicate with the entity or to try and find ways of directly combatting it.  All of which just seems to be bringing the being on and on closer into our world, and leading to an increasingly scary series of events and a shock ender.Some will find the movie too slow-moving.  Personally, I liked its pace, I liked how in the first third of the movie most of what we're seeing the camera capture is just ordinary, everyday stuff.  It makes it feel real, lets you know the characters, and makes it more potent when events do progress from just the occasional unexplained noise to more bizarre events.  I think it was extremely well-executed, and is one of the best movies of its kind.

But nothing could be further from the truth. I'm not the type of person who's hard to please. My wife and I spend so much money in Blockbuster, we should own a controlling interest in that company, and out of the slew of horror movies we buy, I would rate at least 75% of them decent and watchable. But whenever a hyped-to-the-moon-and-back, umpolished turd like this is thrust upon an unsuspecting and gullible movie going public, my hackles rise, and I feel an overwhelming sense of duty (for lack of a better term) to warn people.Another reviewer said it better than I ever could, when he (or she) said this movie really shook his (or her) confidence in 'professional critics'. I'll just stick with the 'Joe Six Pack' reviews from here on out.Now, onto the movie.I'm so incredibly sick and tired of all the ""You have to use your imagination!"" type horror movies that have been polluting Hollywood ever since 'The Blair Witch Project' was released. Note to any 'professional film makers' who may possibly read this for feedback: When we (the movie going public) walk into a theater to see your movie, or go to Blockbuster to buy it, were are plonking our hard-earned dollars down for YOU to entertain us. YOU are the one making the movie, not us. If I want to 'use my imagination', I'll read a book. (and yes, I do actually read, alot) What movies like these are doing would have been tantamount to someone asking a New Orleans Saints fan to buy a ticket to the Super Bowl, go to the game, then put on a blindfold, insert a pair of ear plugs, and imagine the game being played, instead of...you know...actually watching it. Or asking the same fan to wait until the last 45 seconds of the game before entering the stadium.This movie was painful. BORING. Let's watch the camera watch the couple sleeping. Let's watch the camera record a door moving back and forth. Let's watch the camera record the couple bickering. But the plot THICKENS!!! Let's hear mysterious 'bumps in the night!' Let's hear the girl scream for no reason! Let's watch the testosterone-having boyfriend challenge the demon to show itself and fight, like a ten year old schoolboy trying to impress his ten year old girlfriend! Rinse, lather, repeat.

Oren Peli both wrote and directed this film which is nothing short of a breakout success with how much attention and money he has made off of it with such an amazingly low production budget. Love it or hate it you have to give Oren credit for being able to create a film that has outdone almost everything out there on the ratio for the profit margin - it honestly wasn't a bad film either.While it's a movie that suffers from being unable to sit through multiple viewings (at least anywhere near each other), being horribly spoiled by audiences knowing what to expect going into it, and many other things that come from a low budget movie's big screen success - it was still a great film. When I sat down for my first screening of the film it actually wasn't prior to a theatrical release and I'm glad I didn't have to watch it as a screener copy though possibly at a convention would have been cool. As I sat down you could feel a buzz going through the audience as it was a showing for all horror fans (about a month before a wide release was announced.) The entire crowd had heard amazing things about it and this was before the marketing machine had crept in and managed to dull the feeling of the film many have missed out on.The entire film consists of 8 characters even though the majority only focuses on the couple Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat.) I love how the majority of the cast has the characters retain the same name as the actors who play them. It's setup to show the couple as being completely realistic and also sets Katie up as having a chance at being a real scream queen if a few casting agents take notice as she really is able to belt it out. As I was saying the couple's interactions for the most part are completely realistic (though Micah's insistence at about the half way mark of the movie to still figure it all out on his own get's a bit tiresome.) People who don't believe in ghosts aren't going to believe that a person can be haunted and try to poke at it to come up with a rational answer which is exactly what Micah does. Katie who knows she is haunted just wants to leave it be as provoking it always makes it worse.The movie has a very slow build up which can hurt it with audiences who have no patience in their movies though the buildup brings up quite a few mind blowing moments of suspense for those who do like a slow start. They are able to capture exactly what makes our cast so afraid of going to bed at night. It's an amazing achievement to be able to get a crowd react so much to purely suspense and not scares in a film and something that is mainly a lost art in Hollywood. Too many people enjoy instant payoffs so the slow buildup has been overlooked for years - Paranormal Activity shows that this is still a valid art form in the realm of making horror.",3,So many ghost stories so little time,1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,2955,"['Paranormal', 'was', 'smash', 'hit', 'was', 'first', 'created', 'shown', 'fests', '2007', 'only', 'got', 'theatrical', 'release', '2009', 'Peli', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'nothing', 'short', 'breakout', 'success', 'how', 'much', 'attention', 'money', 'made', 'amazingly', 'low', 'production', 'budget', 'Love', 'hate', 'have', 'give', 'Oren', 'credit', 'being', 'able', 'create', 'film', 'outdone', 'almost', 'everything', 'out', 'there', 'ratio', 'profit', 'margin', 'honestly', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'movie', 'being', 'unable', 'sit', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'least', 'anywhere', 'other', 'being', 'horribly', 'spoiled', 'audiences', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'going', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'come', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'success', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'film', 'When', 'sat', 'down', 'first', 'screening', 'film', 'actually', 'was', ""n't"", 'prior', 'theatrical', 'release', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'watch', 'screener', 'copy', 'possibly', 'convention', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'sat', 'could', 'feel', 'buzz', 'going', 'audience', 'was', 'showing', 'horror', 'fans', 'month', 'wide', 'release', 'was', 'announced', 'entire', 'crowd', 'had', 'heard', 'amazing', 'things', 'was', 'marketing', 'machine', 'had', 'crept', 'managed', 'dull', 'feeling', 'film', 'many', 'have', 'missed', 'out', 'on.The', 'entire', 'film', '8', 'characters', 'even', 'majority', 'only', 'couple', 'Katie', 'Katie', 'Featherston', 'Micah', 'Micah', 'Sloat', 'love', 'how', 'majority', 'cast', 'characters', 'retain', 'same', 'name', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'setup', 'show', 'couple', 'being', 'completely', 'realistic', 'also', 'sets', 'Katie', 'up', 'having', 'chance', 'being', 'real', 'scream', 'queen', 'few', 'casting', 'agents', 'take', 'notice', 'really', 'able', 'belt', 'out', 'was', 'saying', 'couple', 'interactions', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'completely', 'realistic', 'Micah', 'insistence', 'half', 'way', 'mark', 'movie', 'still', 'figure', 'out', 'own', 'get', 'bit', 'tiresome', 'People', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ghosts', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'believe', 'person', 'can', 'be', 'haunted', 'try', 'poke', 'come', 'up', 'rational', 'answer', 'exactly', 'what', 'Micah', 'Katie', 'who', 'haunted', 'just', 'leave', 'be', 'provoking', 'always', 'worse.The', 'movie', 'very', 'slow', 'build', 'can', 'hurt', 'audiences', 'who', 'have', 'patience', 'movies', 'buildup', 'up', 'quite', 'few', 'mind', 'blowing', 'moments', 'suspense', 'who', 'do', 'slow', 'start', 'are', 'able', 'capture', 'exactly', 'what', 'cast', 'so', 'afraid', 'going', 'bed', 'night', 'amazing', 'achievement', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'crowd', 'react', 'so', 'much', 'purely', 'suspense', 'not', 'scares', 'film', 'something', 'mainly', 'lost', 'art', 'Hollywood', 'Too', 'many', 'people', 'enjoy', 'instant', 'payoffs', 'so', 'slow', 'buildup', 'been', 'overlooked', 'years', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'still', 'valid', 'art', 'form', 'realm', 'making', 'horror']",N/A
1293844,AZBMTXXNPS6YD,B002VKE0XA,"Subauthor ""jeffgonsalves dot com""","[5, 11]","The premise is simple: a pleasant, good-natured woman has been haunted by a supernatural being for most of her life. Her boyfriend, who is the type of guy who thinks he can contend with an otherworldly entity simply because he's hyped up on testosterone, wants to get the creepy details on tape. So he buys an expensive camera, sets up a tripod in their bedroom, and endlessly records their nocturnal activities in hopes of illuminating exactly what is happening to his girlfriend. Unfortunately, this very conceit seems to upset the malevolent trickster stalking her, and results in an escalation of the being's involvement. At one point, the boyfriend yells, ""Is that all you got?"" and consequently, the demon more than rises to the challenge.The genius of ""Paranormal Activity"" (besides it's reported $11,000 budget), is that it leaves much to the imagination. Like ""Blair Witch Project"", it never shows exactly what is obsessed with the woman, and for people with fertile imaginations, the unknown becomes frightening. ""Paranormal"" removes the shaky camera work that many found distracting in ""Blair Witch"", but the grainy, black/white photography is chilling and gives the film an aura of authenticity. The luminous glow creating a surreal halo around the master bedroom is akin to the strobelight flashing through the darkness in the eerie Maryland woods of ""Blair Witch"". And like ""Blair"", the majority of the action takes place in the dead of night, making one dread the arrival of dusk. I actually felt a tingly prickling at the back of my neck when the automated timer clicked to 2:00 a.m. and the ominous rumble-buzz appeared, signaling the arrival of the mischievous demon.Part of what is so scary about ""Paranormal"" is that it seems like it could really happen. Gore is kept to a minimum, and the excruciating pauses play like reality. Details are intriguing and well-developed. The boyfriend keeps taunting the demon, trying to up the ante, and the demon seeks payback. Both characters are sympathetic, and the director keeps ratcheting up the tension as the two get more and more stressed, to the point of anger and hysteria. She wants the horrifying events to end; he simply wants to be in control and get them on tape. Purchasing a ouja board might be the last straw, inviting the demon in so it can wreak havoc on their lives. One wonders if the boyfriend had been less obnoxious, maybe the demon wouldn't have felt a need to invade their home in such relentless, aggressive fashion.The actors/actresses are excellent. The boyfriend is cocky and feels like he needs to challenge the demon to show his loyalty. His girlfriend acts reasonably despite being battered with fear. I loved the part when the ghost expert steps into the house and immediately retreats, sensing that the entity is bristling and doesn't want him in the house. Unlike the priest in ""The Exorcist"", this man is intimidated and feels his presence will only enrage the demon.The true emotional impact of ""Paranormal Activity"" would be seeing it alone, in a gloomy room, in total silence. The showing I attended was packed, and many audience members ruined the spooky tone by yelling inane comments at the screen.

The script is clever enough to slowly amp up the tension through escalating little effects.  The sound of footsteps, objects moving, doors slamming.  More effort is spent watching dark hallways and floors than most horror films engage their audiences.I have a feeling that most of the negative reviews here are from horror fans who expect a lot of grotesque violence in their movies.

IF i did encounter a ghost, id tell it to not make a mess or too much noise. ghosts/evil spirits on film have to do MUCH MORE than make doors move or floors creak. 100 steps, while sort of slow moving, did have an awesome ghost/evil spirit.imho, ghost movies are for women and children. they are easily ''freaked'' out and scared. just go to any theater showing a horror movie and watch whos covering their eyes or hiding their heads....women and children, for the most part.another strike against this, for me, is the POV gimmick.

This is an outstanding horror film.The film follows our two protagonists, Katie and Micah, a young couple. Micah, Katie's somewhat skeptical and foolish boyfriend, has recently bought a camera and plans on documenting the so-called presence that seems to be following Katie, and manifesting itself as some sort of haunting.The film is great, and follows a good ""less is more"" philosophy, relying more on creeps and subtle scares (loud noises or doors opening and closing by themselves, etc) then on gore or monsters.  It was good in the theater, but is even better when viewed at home, in the dark with friends or family or even by yourself.The DVD and Blu-Ray release, though, is fairly weak.  There are no real special features to speak of (save for one alternate ending), which is a shame.  We know for fact that there is a second alternate ending floating around online, in addition to unused footage and a commentary track the director recorded for the UK release (from what I've heard), so it's kind of annoying that the American R1 release got passed up on for special features.In addition, although more of a nit-pick, I have to complain about something else with the Blu-Ray.  The two sequels both included not only the Blu-Ray disc, but also a DVD AND Digital Copy, whereas this film only includes the Blu-Ray and digital copy...  No DVD, which is annoying, as although I have a Blu-Ray player, I don't have one in every room with a TV, so some rooms still only have regular DVD players, so it's limiting for now until I upgrade the rest of my stuff.But all in all, good film, sub-par release for the R1 territories, but still worth buying for the great thrills and chills it provides.",4,"Great movie, Sup-par Blu-Ray/DVD Release...",1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,1764,"['was', 'just', 'reviewing', 'film', ""'d"", 'have', 'given', '5', '5', 'outstanding', 'horror', 'film.The', 'film', 'two', 'protagonists', 'Katie', 'Micah', 'young', 'couple', 'Micah', 'Katie', 'somewhat', 'skeptical', 'foolish', 'boyfriend', 'recently', 'bought', 'camera', 'plans', 'documenting', 'so-called', 'presence', 'be', 'following', 'Katie', 'manifesting', 'sort', 'haunting.The', 'film', 'great', 'good', 'less', 'more', 'philosophy', 'relying', 'more', 'creeps', 'subtle', 'scares', 'loud', 'noises', 'doors', 'opening', 'closing', 'etc', 'then', 'gore', 'monsters', 'was', 'good', 'theater', 'even', 'better', 'when', 'viewed', 'home', 'dark', 'friends', 'family', 'even', 'yourself.The', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'fairly', 'weak', 'are', 'real', 'special', 'features', 'speak', 'save', 'one', 'alternate', 'ending', 'shame', 'know', 'fact', 'second', 'alternate', 'ending', 'floating', 'around', 'online', 'addition', 'unused', 'footage', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'recorded', 'UK', 'release', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'kind', 'annoying', 'American', 'R1', 'release', 'got', 'passed', 'up', 'special', 'features.In', 'addition', 'more', 'nit-pick', 'have', 'complain', 'something', 'else', 'Blu-Ray', 'two', 'sequels', 'included', 'not', 'only', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'also', 'DVD', 'AND', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'film', 'only', 'Blu-Ray', 'digital', 'copy', 'DVD', 'annoying', 'have', 'Blu-Ray', 'player', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'room', 'TV', 'rooms', 'still', 'only', 'have', 'regular', 'DVD', 'players', 'limiting', 'now', 'upgrade', 'rest', 'stuff.But', 'good', 'film', 'sub-par', 'release', 'R1', 'territories', 'still', 'worth', 'buying', 'great', 'thrills', 'chills']",N/A

I could never have even imagined the movie would be like that. I'm still in disbelief.  My husband and I still talk about it.  After the movie was over the audience clapped and I just sat there unable to move for a while. You see, my mind would not allow me to comprehend what I had just seen.  No, hell NO!!!  No way I just spent time and money watching perhaps the most tedious movie I had ever seen.  I questioned why the audience clapped.  Was it because it was a good movie or because it was FINALLY OVER!!!  Now I understand the concept of less is more.  I loved ""The Others"".  I also have a great imagination, but footprints in the baby powder didn't get my heart racing.  Nor did the slight movement of the door, or those LONG BORING rocking sessions by the bed .  OMG, I was amazed that so many people still liked the movie even after seeing it.  I could understand being fooled by the previews, but I can't fathom anything good being said after actually surviving watching it.  See, there must have been some kind of paranormal activity involved to make so many believe that this was actually a scary and entertaining movie.  And for that alone I give it FIVE STARS!!!  It's amazing how they were able to pull that off, truly amazing.  I suppose to be fair I should mention the two times in the theater that I was actually startled.  The entire movie I kept thinking, ""It's going to get good any minute now."" Finally she runs up the stairs and throws Mica at the camera!  I was like ""Thank GOD! Now it's gonna get good!"", and then the credits rolled. Oh, the other part was when the theater was perfectly quiet and this loud, non-human like growl broke the silence and I jumped!  Sadly, I can't guarantee that all movie goers got to experience this scare, as it was my husband who was snoring in the seat next to me.

1293856,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B002VKE0XA,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[0, 0]","Paranormal Activity is an independent film that was first shown in film festivals in 2007 and 2008 then later released in theatres in 2009. It was made on a $15 000 budget and generated over 150 Million at the box office alone. To me there are two types of horror films; the slasher type with a killer who chases people, and secondly the more psychological horror movie which tends to mess with your mind and make you think and can have some kind of effect on you. The one is definitely the second type.The story is simple as Kathie and Micah move to a new home in California. Then it gets more complicated as Kathie tells how something has haunted her since she was a child and that she thinks it followed them into this new home. As the title suggests strange things happen in the house, the idea is not new or really creative but it works for Paranormal Activity.The way the movie is filmed is in an amateur, self-made Blair Witch type of way which creates a certain atmosphere throughout the film. You can also tell that the movie was made in an amateur way, the actors aren't very good and all but I guess its how it was supposed to be and contributes to the setting. At first nothing much happens, everything is normal and the action is slow but things gradually get worse and therefore, more exciting for the viewers.  It takes a while to get into the movie but as soon as the paranormal night stuff happens you're hooked and want to know what's next. They call Dr.Fredrichs, a psychic who informs them that a demon is after Kathie and they should get help, he doesn't do much to help them. Micah instead decides to record what happens at night on his camera. From then on, crazy things happen at night and during the day they talk about it. At first they don't notice what happens when they sleep except when watching the recordings but then this supernatural force interferes in their sleep and freaks them out...and many of the viewers I should add.The movie made me curious enough to find out what happens, watching each night knowing something strange, weird and freaky was going to happen. The fact that the events get more and more bizarre made the film exciting. I think the movie was certainly well thought but it lacked some explanations and doesn't go into much detail, it's pretty basic; the boring day stuff happens (except closer to the end) and the night is when the good parts of the movie are. All in all Paranormal Activities is neither a flunker nor a hit in my opinion; it has its moments, was a solid entertainment and provided a little scare. I just think it might have been overhyped, many of my friends told me it was real scary and how terrified they were after watching it and some critics said it was one of the scariest films of all time. To me after watching the movie and seeing the trailer again made me realise that many of the best scenes are in the trailer. Also the way the trailer was made the movie look like it used some real footage and that the events really happened when they did not and it's a fake story. There are not any special features except an  alternate ending that is not bad but I conclude that the one they used in the movie is much better, it's worth watching despite this but I can see why they used the other.

Most people go to see films like this to get an adrenaline rush. Again, if you have seen the trailer, the fun is pretty much ruined. Even the big 'climactic' ending is spoiled (shown in the trailer) so you expect it.I applaud the film for doing so well on a ridiculously unheard of budget. It certainly is better than most other so-called horror films out there now. It feels more realistic, especially with the two main characters doing a pretty good job of acting genuinely scared. However, there are parts in the film that felt set up and unauthentic. For example, if your girlfriend was screaming her head off in another part of the house, would you take the time to grab your video camera first, or would you just go running after her? It's just little moments like that which sort of spoiled some of the excitement for me.Also, the original ending is WAY better than the theatrical one. It feels more realistic, while the theatrical ending feels, well, Hollywoodized (not a word, but well, I think everyone knows what I mean...)",3,Dissapointing,1262476800,"01 3, 2010",2010,1499,"['warning', 'first', 'intend', 'watch', 'film', 'unspoiled', 'hopefully', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'trailer', 'should', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'experience', 'was', 'ruined', 'am', 'not', 'exaggerating', '90', '%', 'scares', 'were', 'trailer', 'Basically', 'have', 'seen', 'trailer', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film.Is', 'tad', 'original', 'Not', 'really', 'overhyped', 'Yep.If', 'scare', 'easily', 'may', 'enjoy', 'not', 'depending', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'BE', 'scared', 'Most', 'people', 'go', 'see', 'films', 'get', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'Again', 'have', 'seen', 'trailer', 'fun', 'pretty', 'much', 'ruined', 'Even', 'big', ""'climactic"", 'ending', 'spoiled', 'shown', 'trailer', 'expect', 'it.I', 'film', 'doing', 'so', 'well', 'ridiculously', 'unheard', 'budget', 'certainly', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'so-called', 'horror', 'films', 'there', 'now', 'more', 'realistic', 'especially', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'doing', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'genuinely', 'scared', 'However', 'are', 'parts', 'film', 'felt', 'set', 'up', 'unauthentic', 'example', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'screaming', 'head', 'part', 'house', 'would', 'take', 'time', 'grab', 'video', 'camera', 'first', 'would', 'just', 'go', 'running', 'just', 'little', 'moments', 'sort', 'spoiled', 'excitement', 'me.Also', 'original', 'ending', 'WAY', 'better', 'theatrical', 'one', 'more', 'realistic', 'theatrical', 'ending', 'feels', 'well', 'Hollywoodized', 'not', 'word', 'well', 'think', 'everyone', 'what', 'mean']",N/A

Most of the film's problems stem from the male character, Micah. It is obvious that the story needs to be propelled, however, his actions often lack the authenticity the film so desperately relies on. Micah quickly becomes a caricature of skepticism and male bravado. He begins, understandably enough, as dismissive of his girlfriend Katie's story of a lifetime of haunting, but as the story goes on, his stubborn refusal to allow her to bring in outside help becomes unrealistic. Even after seeing irrefutable physical evidence of an entity around them, he continues to assert that he should be the one to protect his girlfriend. Even as he continues to profess a form of cynicism, he actively, and against his girlfriend's EXPRESS wishes, attempts to communicate with the entity, predominantly through juvenile taunting and a Ouija board. This Ouija board plot thread is completely pointless as it adds nothing to the story and actually serves to weaken it, as Micah attempts to explain that the 'demon' wants to inexplicably 'warn them'... about itself(?).The dialogue is mostly improvised, and this fact is sometimes distractingly clear. The ending also leaves a little to be desired, as it resorts to the old 'The killer was never found!' trope to leave the audience's nerves on end as they leave the theater.With that said, the film is very admirable in its ability to conjure tension and suspense with no latex or CGI beasties. The film has drawn a lot of comparisons to 'The Blair Witch Project' and many are valid. However, I saw 'The Blair Witch Project' a couple of months before it was released widely, and as such, had heard nothing about it. As I sat in the theater, I suspected it was fiction, but was never convinced.

Micah and Katie are beset by noises, moving objects, lights going on and off, and, as we eventually discover, a demonic presence which has been after Katie since she was a young child.  Her BF Micah, for the most part, is more interested in his camera work than in the dangerous situation that she is in...until it is too late.He makes a terrible mistake in bringing in the Ouija board, and I still think calling an exorcist might have helped this unfortunate couple.The strength of the movie lies in the fact that it does not depend on blood and gore for effect; instead, it works on the viewer's psyche and makes the imagination run wild.

1293873,AP3B615GM191G,B002VKE0XA,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","After being told that ""Paranormal Activity"" was the ""next big thing"" in horror movies (in line with The Ring and Saw), I wanted to experience the phenomena first-hand.  Unfortunately, despite the film's knack for making you continue to watch just to ""see what happens"", it left me disappointed in the end.For a basic plot summary, the film focuses on a young married couple who begin experiencing some strange phenomena once their heads hit the pillow at night.  It starts with little things, like creaky noises and bumps in the night, but eventually escalates into footsteps, moving sheets, and slamming doors...too obvious to be anything ""naturally occurring"".  The young couple then must decide what to do next...run away, or stay and fight this invisible force.The interesting angle of this movie is that it is shot in a format not seen since The Blair Witch Project...handy-cam (for lack of a better word).  However, the manic flailings of ""Blair Witch"" are tamed down this time into a simple camera on a tripod recording all the action.  Whereas most traditional horror movies try to scare you with disfigured antagonists or bursts of well-timed creepy music, this effort just lets the ""camera do the talking"".  It is a very unique way of creating suspense, and thus at least held my interest until the very end.The big problem, though, is two-fold: repetition and incredible annoying characters.  Every night, the same thing happens: a noise startles the man, who curses a few times, which wakes up his wife, who pleads with him not to go downstairs (which he always does anyway).  That same sequence happens literally every night until the very end of the film.  It doesn't help that both characters (played by Katie Featherston & Micah Sloat) do nothing but annoy each other (and thus the audience) for the duration.  Micah treats the whole ordeal as a joke, even when the visual evidence is too much to deny, while Katie is reduced to little more than a scream-machine (albeit a very attractive one).Thus, although Paranormal Activity is indeed a novel way to create a horror film, I can't wholly recommend it due to the shallow characters and repetitive plot.  Up until the final couple of minutes, the plot is so tired and slow as to almost be boring at times.
