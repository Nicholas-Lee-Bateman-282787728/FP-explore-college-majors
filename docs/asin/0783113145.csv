42686,A3W3PK9TVKEH7Q,0783113145,Allen Jackson,"[5, 5]","""A Bronx Tale"" is one of my favorite movies, of any genre, ever.  The story is interesting, the ""life lessons"" are provided amply via great dialog and acting, the 9-year-old kid is cute as heck and just terrific in his role (the older version of him actor is not far behind him in acting ability), and the place and time are perfectly re-created. (I can relate to the characters, having known some version of almost every one of them when growing up in NY.)  I can view this movie again and again, and I love it every time.This review is specifically about the blu ray release, this so-called Region-Free version.  This is actually the official United Kingdom release of this item-- this movie has never been released on Blu-Ray in the USA-- but it has been released in the UK.  This Blu-Ray is incorrectly labeled on the back-side artwork as ""Region B,"" but actually it is a Region-Free disc, meaning it will play on Blu-Ray players around the world.  However, I can tell you that the special features--the two extras (a making-of documentary and a trailer)-- may or may not work on Region ""A"" (US) Blu Ray players (actually any non-region-B Blu Ray players).  The UPC for this release is 5055201819864, which is the one I have, and English is the only supported audio and subtitle language.On mine, the extras simply won't play when clicked on.  I tried several times, including switching off my 2013 Sony Blu Ray player, ejecting the disc, inserting it again and trying the special features again.  Nothing happens when they are clicked on.  The movie itself plays fine, but the extras, once highlighted (pointed at), do nothing when clicked.Maybe someone else has a different brand of BR player that will work with this blu ray, but my US ""Region A"" player is clearly not fully compatible with this ""Region-Free"" disc.  Funny thing, I have a British-made Region-Free Blu Ray of ""Notting Hill,"" and all the extras on that work perfectly.Another technical malady: one time, when I fast-forwarded through this film at the highest speed, I could not then get it to stop; it raced through many minutes of the movie, though the displayed time point in the movie didn't budge, and the only way I could stop it was to turn off my player-- a fairly new unit that's had no problem with any other DVD or Blu Ray, and I've played at least 100 discs on it.  Fast-forwarding and rewinding at slower speeds yields no problem.Another complaint for this British version blu ray: the English subtitles are VERY loosely written, not nearly as accurate in reflecting the exact words spoken as are either of the previous DVDs. One example that irks me: after Jane had encountered Sonny's guys while looking for Cologero, he then comes upon those men, and one says to him that ""A fine-looking moolinyan chick was just here looking for you.""  This is accurately re-stated in the subtitles for the DVDs, but NOT on this British blu ray, where instead the subtitles say, ""A pretty black girl was just here looking for you.""  Why do they swap ""girl"" for ""chick""?  ""Pretty"" for ""fine-looking""?  And ""black"" for ""moolinyan""?  The latter means ""eggplant"" in Italian and is a slur towards blacks; why do the British clean this up for the hearing-impaired?  They certainly didn't overdub the audio, as what the man actually said remains in this blu ray version as intended . . .As for the look of the film: it's the best version we've seen, but not perfect.  The color is vivid, and the picture often sharp, but not always.  In most scenes, it looks like a light is shining on the faces of the actors, such that the flesh tones don't look authentic. Some scenes look far less high-def than others.  Overall, it's a ""good"" (not ""very good"" or ""excellent"") HD remastering/transfer, but I've seen many more blu ray movies that were sharper on my 55"" HD TV, even much older films.  The bit rate is not the highest, rarely getting into the high 20s, hardly ever the low 30s (Mbps).I'm a bit disappointed with this blu ray, ESPECIALLY at the $25.00 or so price.  The studio seems to give with one hand, then take away with the other, for this movie's various releases.  The first DVD, from HBO, had decent picture quality and had the two extras.  The 2nd and last DVD, from another studio, has a MUCH better picture than the first--it looks very sharp on my older tube TV and darned good on my HD TV, too-- but it contains no extras.  Then this Blu Ray is released in England, with extras, but they won't play for me in the US.  And the actors' flesh tones, again, don't look so great.No more versions of this film for me!  I need to keep ALL THREE of the ones I have so as to enjoy the extras (on just one, the first DVD) and to see the best picture quality (the Blu Ray on my HD TV and the later (2nd) DVD on my non-HD, tube TV).I hope this review helps!",3,LOVE the film;

Seidler ""Fog City person""","[2, 2]","A Bronx Tale is a coming of age story about a young boy who becomes enchanted with the life of neighborhood tough guys who are involved in schemes to make money without working.  His father is a bus driver for the city and has not inspired his son to that level of income and routine.  The father, however, has instilled in his son the virtue of working for a salary and doing one's share to make the community a safe place.  Conflict begins when the son becomes more and more involved with tough guys, particularly the so-called leader of the group.  He enjoys hanging out with these men in spite of his father's admonitions that he not become a flunky for them.  The son enjoys the wages he earns for doing small tasks for the men, but though the lead gang member advises his protege to not run with certain tough school mates, he wants to be part of a group.As the story unfolds, the young man evidently sees first hand the duplicity of the gang and mainly, the main leader.  His father recovers his son and supposedly he continues in school, etc.  Worth seeing even though there are brutal scenes of the gang's retribution to those who trespass on their turf.Anna M.

Actually, the co-star is Lilo Brancoto, who was in the news severral years ago for allegedly committing a major crime himself.It may have a bad message, and gives a couple shots at the Catholic Church along the way, but the characters and the story keeps one tuned to the screen for the full two hours. It was good to see De Niro play the honest, hard-working bus driver who wants his son to have character and not emulate the local hoods.This is a not a movie for those who wince at the f-word because it's used frequently.

I only gave it 4 stars because giving it 5 stars would mean that it was up there with the reigning king of all gangster movies, Scarface (1983). With that out of the way, let me say that  this is one of the most underappreciated films of the 90's. Commercially  unsuccessful, this should have gotten much more praise and location in '93  when it was first introduced. It's a movie about a kid who's torn between  his loving father and the most respected hood in the neighborhood, Sonny.  Sounds pretty simple, but De Niro told this Bronx Tale with mastery and  precision.

He played the young man in this splendid movie which deserves to be seen by everybody.  It is a beautifully written and acted production.  Brancato portrayed so accurately the challenges of a young Italian-America youth being raised among the gangsters in his blue collar community.  I always wondered why he virtually disappeared.  Brancato's small role playing a cheap gangster on ""The Sopranos"" didn't even begin to equal what had earlier been expected of him.Robert Di Niro is fantastic as the father, a proud bus driver, trying to make sure his only son remains a law abiding citizen.  Chazz Palminteri is likewise brilliant playing the role of the neighborhood Mafia chieftain.  He also wrote the spellbinding script. ""A Bronx Tale"" apparently was only modestly successful. I simply cannot understand why it isn't considered as one of the very best movies of that time period. This is a family movie.  Anyone who is a teenager or older should enjoy it immensely.  You truly feel like you are visiting the 1960s.  It is a warm and loving story about choices that must be made early in one's life.  Lastly, why hasn't Di Niro directed more films?

42708,A26D5IRV2OLU4B,0783113145,D. Munro,"[1, 1]","This movie is a wonderful triangle between three characters -- a boy and the two men he looks up to: his father, Lorenzo (Robert De Niro), and Sonny (Chazz Palminteri), the local mafia boss.  Both men love C and advise him, with completely different points of view. It is the two men who fight to be the dominating force in C's life.It's 1960.  Nine year old Calogero LOVES the Yankees.  He likes to hang out with his friends -- all boys from the Italian neighborhood of the Bronx.  His father Lorenzo is a busdriver, his mother a homemaker.  Just yards away is the club that is owned by Sonny, the area's high-ranked mafia underboss.  Sonny and ""his boys"" are the local heroes ...  to everybody but Lorenzo.One day, Calogero is sitting on the front stoop to his apartment building and he witnesses a shooting.  He not only sees the entire event unfold, but sees -- and locks eyes with -- the man holding the gun, none other than Sonny.  When Calogero is summoned by the police to face a line-up of suspects, Lorenzo is fearful ...  he knows what could happen if his son names the shooter.  Forced by the police, Lorenzo brings his son downstairs to stand in front of the suspects, who happen to be mobsters.  Calogero stands in front of each man and shakes his head.  Finally, he is brought in front of Sonny, and the stare at each other again.  Calogero once again shakes his head, allowing all the men to be released.  ""I did a good thing, right Dad? I didn't rat!"" he tells his father.  ""You did a good thing ... for a bad man,"" his father replies, but admits to his son that he did the right thing.  Calogero's show of loyalty to Sonny immediately earns him great respect -- not only amongst the neighbors,  but also by the mobsters.  Right away, one of Sonny's men contacts Lorenzo and presents him with a job offer on the side.  Lorenzo politely -- but succinctly -- declines.  He wants no part of the mob.Sonny summons Calogero to him and the two talk.  When Calogero expresses his anger over the latest Yankees game (where they lost), Sonny's reply to that is, ""Forget them, forget Mickey Mantle! He doesn't care about you -- why should you care about him?""  Calogero asks Sonny why he shot the man and Sonny replies, ""You'll understand when you get older.""  Calogero begins to sneak away from home and visit Sonny in the club, where he learns how to serve drinks (making large tips in the process) and how to throw dice.  As he and Sonny grow closer, Sonny presents him with a new name -- ""C.""  C learns quickly that being in Sonny's circle has a lot of perks and earns him special treatment from many of the local vendors.When Lorenzo discovers his son's cash ($600), he angrily goes to Sonny's club, with C in tow, to return the money.  Sonny and Lorenzo nearly come to blows and Lorenzo angrily yells, ""He's not your son, he's mine!"" C is angry with his father and yells at him, ""People love Sonny, just like people love you on the bus!"" Lorenzo tells his son, ""They don't love him, they fear him!""Sonny becomes C's mentor as the boy grows into a teenager.  Sonny shows a firm hand when something could negatively affect C, scaring off a local punk trying to sell C's gang of friends illegal guns.  C looks up to Sonny even more as the movie goes on, envying the fancy cars and the high respect the mafia boss receives wherever he goes.  When Sonny invites C to a boxing match, C has to decline -- he already promised his father he would go with him.  C watches from high up as Sonny is sitting ringside, wishing he was sitting with Sonny instead.""Is it better to be loved or feared?"" C asks Sonny. Sonny's reply is direct: feared.  ""Fear lasts longer than love.""  C develops feelings for a black girl and expresses this to Sonny, who is laid back about it.  Sonny tells C that it doesn't matter and explains how to immediately see if the girl is a ""good one.""  Then Sonny offers C his sports car for the date.  Lorenzo's feelings on an Italian-Black relationship is the opposite of Sonny's: he doesn't want his son dating a non-Italian.  Both men have completely different views on life and  what is important.  In the end, C comes of age having seen the views of both men and appreciating them both in different ways.Chazz Palminteri does a splendid job as Sonny, who is by no means innocent but nonetheless loves C as his own son.  He makes it a point to show that Sonny has not gone soft, despite his closeness to C ... and in a moment of great conflict, shows that he can turn on anybody in a second.  And Robert DeNiro (also the director) performs well as Lorenzo, who struggles against a mobster for the love and respect of his own son.  Both actors who play C, Francis Capra and Lillo Brancato, do well ... though it is the younger C that makes C most believable.  Also in this is Joe Pesci, who makes a brief appearance in the very beginning  and finally speaks at the end.",5,"""Is it better to be loved or feared?""",1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,4895,"['movie', 'wonderful', 'triangle', 'three', 'characters', 'boy', 'two', 'men', 'up', 'father', 'Lorenzo', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Sonny', 'Chazz', 'Palminteri', 'local', 'mafia', 'boss', 'men', 'love', 'C', 'advise', 'completely', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'fight', 'be', 'dominating', 'force', 'C', 'life.It', '1960', 'Nine', 'year', 'old', 'Calogero', 'LOVES', 'Yankees', 'hang', 'out', 'friends', 'boys', 'Italian', 'neighborhood', 'Bronx', 'father', 'Lorenzo', 'busdriver', 'mother', 'homemaker', 'Just', 'yards', 'away', 'club', 'owned', 'Sonny', 'area', 'high-ranked', 'mafia', 'underboss', 'Sonny', 'boys', 'are', 'local', 'heroes', 'everybody', 'Lorenzo.One', 'day', 'Calogero', 'sitting', 'front', 'stoop', 'apartment', 'building', 'shooting', 'not', 'only', 'entire', 'event', 'unfold', 'sees', 'locks', 'eyes', 'man', 'holding', 'gun', 'none', 'other', 'Sonny', 'When', 'Calogero', 'summoned', 'police', 'face', 'line-up', 'suspects', 'Lorenzo', 'fearful', 'what', 'could', 'happen', 'son', 'shooter', 'Forced', 'police', 'Lorenzo', 'son', 'stand', 'front', 'suspects', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'mobsters', 'Calogero', 'front', 'man', 'head', 'Finally', 'brought', 'front', 'Sonny', 'stare', 'other', 'again', 'Calogero', 'once', 'again', 'shakes', 'head', 'allowing', 'men', 'be', 'released', 'did', 'good', 'thing', 'right', 'Dad', 'did', ""n't"", 'rat', 'father', 'did', 'good', 'thing', 'bad', 'man', 'father', 'replies', 'son', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'Calogero', 'show', 'loyalty', 'Sonny', 'immediately', 'great', 'respect', 'not', 'only', 'neighbors', 'also', 'mobsters', 'Right', 'away', 'one', 'Sonny', 'men', 'contacts', 'Lorenzo', 'job', 'offer', 'side', 'Lorenzo', 'politely', 'succinctly', 'declines', 'part', 'mob.Sonny', 'summons', 'Calogero', 'two', 'talk', 'When', 'Calogero', 'anger', 'latest', 'Yankees', 'game', 'where', 'lost', 'Sonny', 'reply', 'Forget', 'forget', 'Mickey', 'Mantle', ""n't"", 'care', 'why', 'should', 'care', 'Calogero', 'Sonny', 'why', 'shot', 'man', 'Sonny', 'replies', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'when', 'get', 'older', 'Calogero', 'sneak', 'away', 'home', 'visit', 'Sonny', 'club', 'where', 'how', 'serve', 'drinks', 'making', 'large', 'tips', 'process', 'how', 'throw', 'dice', 'Sonny', 'grow', 'closer', 'Sonny', 'new', 'name', 'C.', 'C', 'quickly', 'being', 'Sonny', 'circle', 'lot', 'perks', 'special', 'treatment', 'many', 'local', 'vendors.When', 'Lorenzo', 'son', 'cash', '600', 'angrily', 'Sonny', 'club', 'C', 'tow', 'return', 'money', 'Sonny', 'Lorenzo', 'nearly', 'come', 'blows', 'Lorenzo', 'angrily', 'not', 'son', 'mine', 'C', 'angry', 'father', 'yells', 'People', 'love', 'Sonny', 'just', 'people', 'love', 'bus', 'Lorenzo', 'son', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'fear', 'Sonny', 'C', 'mentor', 'boy', 'teenager', 'Sonny', 'firm', 'hand', 'when', 'something', 'could', 'negatively', 'affect', 'C', 'scaring', 'off', 'local', 'punk', 'trying', 'sell', 'C', 'gang', 'friends', 'illegal', 'guns', 'C', 'up', 'Sonny', 'even', 'more', 'movie', 'envying', 'fancy', 'cars', 'high', 'respect', 'mafia', 'boss', 'When', 'Sonny', 'C', 'boxing', 'match', 'C', 'decline', 'already', 'promised', 'father', 'would', 'go', 'C', 'watches', 'high', 'up', 'Sonny', 'sitting', 'ringside', 'wishing', 'was', 'sitting', 'Sonny', 'instead', 'better', 'be', 'loved', 'feared', 'C', 'Sonny', 'Sonny', 'reply', 'direct', 'feared', 'Fear', 'longer', 'love', 'C', 'feelings', 'black', 'girl', 'Sonny', 'who', 'laid', 'back', 'Sonny', 'C', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'immediately', 'see', 'girl', 'good', 'one', 'Then', 'Sonny', 'offers', 'C', 'sports', 'car', 'date', 'Lorenzo', 'feelings', 'Italian-Black', 'relationship', 'opposite', 'Sonny', ""n't"", 'want', 'son', 'dating', 'non-Italian', 'men', 'have', 'completely', 'different', 'views', 'life', 'what', 'important', 'end', 'C', 'age', 'having', 'seen', 'views', 'men', 'appreciating', 'different', 'ways.Chazz', 'Palminteri', 'splendid', 'job', 'Sonny', 'who', 'means', 'innocent', 'nonetheless', 'loves', 'C', 'own', 'son', 'point', 'show', 'Sonny', 'not', 'gone', 'soft', 'closeness', 'C', 'moment', 'great', 'conflict', 'can', 'turn', 'anybody', 'second', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'also', 'director', 'well', 'Lorenzo', 'who', 'mobster', 'love', 'respect', 'own', 'son', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'C', 'Francis', 'Capra', 'Lillo', 'Brancato', 'do', 'well', 'younger', 'C', 'C', 'most', 'believable', 'Also', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'who', 'brief', 'appearance', 'very', 'beginning', 'finally', 'speaks', 'end']",N/A

Yet the film seems to be a country revisited several times. The new element is the point of view that is adopted here, that of a kid who is growing from 8 to 17 and is the witness of the law of the neighborhood and how this law is imposed by some group of self appointed people who impose security and guarantee it then. In this case it is an Italian boss, and on the other side it is the Blacks, and no detail is given. What makes this film interesting is how the son sees the world and how he comes to accepting this or that idea, from his father or the local neighborhood boss. We see his personality growing, his independence blooming, at times without knowing it, his reason and moderation expanding at times against his own feelings and convictions. You add girls to that and then accidents on the road of social peace and you may have some real drama in which you discover the real value of this man, or even your father, who did not hate this or that or anyone in particular but rather tried, at times awkwardly to protect you. There are a few funny elements here and there, more dramatic elements now and then, but a lot of pathos all the time.

With the real-life Calogero (Lillo Brancato) currently serving a 10-year sentence for armed robbery-turned-murder, it is unlikely that a major studio will market a re-release any time soon.A Bronx Tale (Amazon.com Exclusive)===> This is available here on Amazon, but be advised it is an ""on demand"" DVD-R.A Bronx Tale [Region 2] ===> This is the Region 2 release.

Nice touch by Bobby D and willingness to be only the third most important role.

In this film Deniro is just a working stiff trying to raise his kid the right way.  His son however, is fascinated by one of the local mob bosses (Chazz Palminteri).  In this story set in the Bronx (circa 1960's) Lorenzo Anello (De Niro) desparately tries to keep his son Calogero on the straight and narrow.  He tries to explain that the guy who gets up and goes to work every morning is the tough guy, not the guy who takes what others have by force.Lillo Brancato who plays the 17 year old son is quite the find here.  This was his acting debut and he has gone on to do other films since.  Originally, this was a one man play written by  Palminteri and the story is based on the events of his youth.Eventually, the mob boss, who can't afford to trust anyone, turns on Calogero even though he loves the boy like a son.  It is then that the teenager understands that his father told him the truth.  Later in the film though, Calogero's life is saved because of the mobster.  When Calogero goes to find his friend and thank him, things take a turn for the worse.This is Deniro's directorial debut.  Who knows better how to direct a gangster film then someone that's been in some of the best crime dramas of all time.  Yes, he still has much to learn but still and all, it's a fine effort.  Deniro made excellent use of the music of the day.  Especially memorable is the bar scene where the gansters beat up a motorcycle gang and during the fight you can hear ""The 10 Commandments of Love"" playing over the visuals.As with most gangster films, there is a lot of foul language and violence here but no nudity or sex.This should be part of your collection if you are a fan of the genre.",5,Mob tale of a different kind,1101427200,"11 26, 2004",2004,1778,"[""'re"", 'used', 'seeing', 'Robert', 'Deniro', 'tough', 'guy', 'gangster', 'then', 'get', 'ready', 'change', 'film', 'Deniro', 'just', 'working', 'stiff', 'trying', 'raise', 'kid', 'right', 'way', 'son', 'however', 'fascinated', 'one', 'local', 'mob', 'bosses', 'Chazz', 'Palminteri', 'story', 'set', 'Bronx', 'circa', '1960', 'Lorenzo', 'Anello', 'De', 'Niro', 'desparately', 'keep', 'son', 'Calogero', 'straight', 'narrow', 'explain', 'guy', 'who', 'up', 'work', 'morning', 'tough', 'guy', 'not', 'guy', 'who', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'force.Lillo', 'Brancato', 'who', '17', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'quite', 'find', 'here', 'was', 'acting', 'debut', 'gone', 'do', 'other', 'films', 'Originally', 'was', 'one', 'man', 'play', 'written', 'Palminteri', 'story', 'based', 'events', 'youth.Eventually', 'mob', 'boss', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'trust', 'anyone', 'Calogero', 'even', 'boy', 'son', 'then', 'teenager', 'father', 'told', 'truth', 'Later', 'film', 'Calogero', 'life', 'saved', 'mobster', 'When', 'Calogero', 'find', 'friend', 'thank', 'things', 'take', 'turn', 'worse.This', 'Deniro', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Who', 'better', 'how', 'direct', 'gangster', 'film', 'then', 'someone', 'been', 'best', 'crime', 'dramas', 'time', 'Yes', 'still', 'much', 'learn', 'still', 'fine', 'effort', 'Deniro', 'made', 'excellent', 'use', 'music', 'day', 'Especially', 'memorable', 'bar', 'scene', 'where', 'gansters', 'beat', 'up', 'motorcycle', 'gang', 'fight', 'can', 'hear', '10', 'Commandments', 'Love', 'playing', 'visuals.As', 'most', 'gangster', 'films', 'lot', 'foul', 'language', 'violence', 'here', 'nudity', 'sex.This', 'should', 'be', 'part', 'collection', 'are', 'fan', 'genre']",N/A
42756,A1DF0XC7XFHKBZ,0783113145,Michael A. Coluccio,"[2, 2]","Based on Chazz Paliminteri's autobiographical one-man play, ""A Bronx Tale"" is an impressive coming-of-age story about a young man, Calogero, or ""C,"" as he is called, growing up in an Italian neighborhood in the Bronx during the racially turbulent Sixties. The boy is torn between the ethical standards set by his scrupulously honest bus driver father, Lorenzo, and the flashy appeal of ""Sonny,"" the charismatic local crime boss.  When Calogero, as a mere child, witnesses Sonny shoot and kill a man in a street dispute and refuses to pick him out of a hastily organized lineup moments later, Sonny takes the boy under his wing, much to the displeasure of his father.  In his own way, Sonny is looking out for the young man's best interests.  He is both paternal and protective, urging C to stop hanging out with his troublemaking friends, and emphasizing the importance of a good education.  He also tutors young Calogero in the ways of the street. ""That way,"" says C, ""I'll be twice as smart as everyone else."" Eventually there is a heated confrontation between the boy's father and the gangster, but the lure of Sonny's lifestyle - a flashy red Cadillac, women, nice clothes, ""respect"" - is too strong for the youngster to resist.  There is an interesting assortment of supporting characters - Eddie Mush (the unluckiest gambler in the world), Tony Toupee (so called because of his ill-fitting hairpiece), Frankie Coffee Cake (whose acne-scarred face reminded everyone of a Drake's coffee cake) - and a host of others who apparently made an indelible impression on the young Palminteri.  There are several memorable scenes - the humorous antics during a basement craps game; the invasion of Sonny's bar by a gang of bikers, to their regret; Sonny's advising his protege on dating etiquette.

Not everybody in this film is a professional actor, including some of the leads, making it a mixed bag at times, but none the less has its moments, and all these mobster movies are about those moments, and to be honest this can stand along side something like Casino from Scorsese no problem because of that.Chazz Palminteri who you know from The Usual Suspects, wrote the story about a boy who grows up between his straight family and the crooked mafia, learning the ropes from both, it is all about choices and consequences, and as others have rightly noted, whole heaps of morality minutes, as killer gangsters try to tell a kid how to hit on a girl, there are some background stories to this plot that work out quite well, not as soppy as let's say Steven Spielberg started tugging your heat strings with John Williams standing in the background with a violin, but it ain't as if Joe Pesci's Tommy would be teaching us how to dance if he didn't have a gun.It is worthy of any collection, but just don't go breaking out this DVD as the best mob movie ever.

42772,A319YRDK8Y39N,0783113145,"""qmlhcb""","[5, 5]","In his directorial debut, Robert DeNiro wisely took the kind of film he is known for as an actor: The gangster film. But A Bronx Tale is much more then just another gangster piece, and it succeeds mostly in its veering away from the usual fare.DeNiro plays a father trying to make an honest living in the Bronx during the 1960's. But when his son ""C"" finds himself allured by the Mafia ""godfather,"" Sonny (Chez Pallimetri), doing business out of a neighboring bar, DeNiro tries to steer his son clear of danger. Soon, however, ""C"" is looking up to Sonny as a second father, and DeNiro feels threatened.Rather then focusing on the crime, it emphasizes the family drama, drawing comparisons between the crime family and blood ties. And fortunately, for the most part, A Bronx Tale avoids common clich&eacute;s and hokey outcomes that dramas concerning family often hit. Instead, it creates an involving situation where no one is portrayed as pure evil.The film is not without its problems, however. At times the film suffers from over explanation, mostly through the use of narration by an older ""C."" He repeatedly states the moral of the tale at the end of the film, when one doesn't need to be stated at all. It's something viewers should decide for themselves, with at most, a hint by the narrator. Also, the film could have used more scenes with just ""C"" and his father, as well as with Sonny, to better crystallize their relationships.

42786,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,0783113145,Stanley Crowe,"[0, 0]","The irony of this 1993 movie, as the viewer cottons on to quite early, is that the honest man Lorenzo Anello (Robert de Niro) and the mobster Sonny (Chazz Palmintieri) both care for young Calogero Anello (Lillo Brancato Jr, for most of the movie) and want him to avoid the danger of life in a gang on the Bronx streets.  Sonny professes to trust and love nobody -- he prefers to be feared -- but clearly young Calogero touches a paternal streak in him, so that Lorenzo and he are working to the same end, though Lorenzo is too scared about his son's future to realize that until the very end of the movie.  De Niro is all working-class dignity as Lorenzo, and Palmintieri is (in a much better-written part) both attractive and repulsive as Sonny.  Brancato is a pretty face and an empty vessel, as the part requires, because the movie's plot is about how that vessel is filled.The main problem is Palmintieri's script -- it's too schematic and full of life-lesson scenes to be totally believable, and the use of Brancato's voice-over as the older Calogero serves to make doubly sure that we, the viewers, know that the life-lesson has been learned.  The incipient love relationship between the Italian Calogero and the African-American Jane (the lovely Taral Hicks) is touching, but is too obviously set up to make a point about the mutual intolerance of the ethnicities involved, and the dialogue between the young lovers isn't carried off convincingly, a fault, I think, more of the writing than of the young actors.  De Niro directed efficiently, and the movie is dedicated to his late father.  The life lessons are good ones -- about hard work, honest money, and sincere feeling -- but when they are so obvious, the characterizations and the writing need to be stronger to avoid stereotyping.  Scorsese's ""Mean Streets"" gets us beneath the cliches of Italian-American life in the 1960s because of the boldness and complexity of the characters; the same could be said of, say, ""Crossing Delancey.""

42793,ABLBRUT8DALNN,0783113145,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","For a long time, A Bronx Tale had distribution problems, was out of print, and was widely unavailable. For those reasons, I hadn't seen it since I was a kid. Watching it again years later, not only did I realize just how good a movie it is, but I also found that I took a lot more out of it. While being widely considered as one of the best mafia movies of all time, A Bronx Tale actually has a deeper meaning, which is not to waste the talent you have in the time you are given. I was also surprised to learn that this story is in fact the true story of Chazz Palminteri's childhood, with Chazz being a nickname for Calogero. For those of you who don't know the story, it's about the son of a bus driver, who grows up in the Bronx, right down the block from a mafia hangout. While this boy learns different things from his real family and his mafia family, who are always at odds, they actually both want the same things for this kid. A Bronx Tale isn't just another gangster movie, there is some of that, but it's really an inspirational coming of age tale that I found to be very eye opening. The cast is of course fantastic, featuring Robert De Niro, who directs and stars in the film, along with Palminteri, who wrote the film. The true irony of A Bronx Tale is surrounded by the true story of Lillo Brancato, the boy who plays Calogero. As I said the story is about discovering right from wrong and not wasting your talent, something Brancato did when he was convicted of an armed robbery, which led to the death of an off-duty police officer. There are many sides to that, but I felt it necessary to mention how ironic it is that the message of the film is actually lost on one it's stars. In closing, A Bronx Tale really is a lost gem, that lives up to all the hype, and I hope that now that's streaming on Netflix, a whole new generation will be exposed to the message it puts out there for them to hear.",5,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,1913,"['long', 'time', 'A', 'Bronx', 'Tale', 'had', 'distribution', 'problems', 'was', 'print', 'was', 'widely', 'unavailable', 'reasons', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'was', 'kid', 'Watching', 'again', 'years', 'later', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'also', 'found', 'took', 'lot', 'more', 'being', 'widely', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'mafia', 'movies', 'time', 'A', 'Bronx', 'Tale', 'actually', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'not', 'waste', 'talent', 'have', 'time', 'are', 'given', 'was', 'also', 'surprised', 'learn', 'story', 'fact', 'true', 'story', 'Chazz', 'Palminteri', 'childhood', 'Chazz', 'being', 'nickname', 'Calogero', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'son', 'bus', 'driver', 'who', 'up', 'Bronx', 'right', 'down', 'block', 'mafia', 'hangout', 'boy', 'different', 'things', 'real', 'family', 'mafia', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'always', 'odds', 'actually', 'want', 'same', 'things', 'kid', 'Bronx', 'Tale', ""n't"", 'just', 'gangster', 'movie', 'really', 'inspirational', 'coming', 'age', 'tale', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'eye', 'opening', 'cast', 'course', 'fantastic', 'featuring', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'who', 'stars', 'film', 'Palminteri', 'who', 'wrote', 'film', 'true', 'irony', 'A', 'Bronx', 'Tale', 'surrounded', 'true', 'story', 'Lillo', 'Brancato', 'boy', 'who', 'Calogero', 'said', 'story', 'discovering', 'right', 'wrong', 'not', 'wasting', 'talent', 'something', 'Brancato', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'convicted', 'armed', 'robbery', 'led', 'death', 'off-duty', 'police', 'officer', 'are', 'many', 'sides', 'felt', 'necessary', 'mention', 'how', 'ironic', 'message', 'film', 'actually', 'lost', 'one', 'stars', 'closing', 'A', 'Bronx', 'Tale', 'really', 'lost', 'gem', 'up', 'hype', 'hope', 'now', 'streaming', 'Netflix', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'will', 'be', 'exposed', 'message', 'out', 'there', 'hear']",N/A

And I'm glad to say that A Bronx Tale is such a movie.This story of C's struggle to balance his love for his hardworking father Lorenzo and the neighborhood mob boss Sonny captivates from beginning to end. I appreciate how Sonny is not written off as a two-bit hood. This is the first movie I've seen that didn't succumb to the usual mobster stereotypes. While I abhored the violence of &quot;the life,&quot; I was touched by Sonny's humanity.One of the most touching moments of the film (among many) was when C seemed to agonize between sitting in the nosebleed section with his father at the boxing match, and sitting with Sonny in the ringside seat. C obviously wanted to go down to ringside, but he seemed to love and respect his father so much that he apologized to his father and stayed put. How many teenagers would do that today? Or at least do so with as much respect and humbleness as opposed to rolling their eyes and smarting off.Joe Pesci's appearance at the end was disturbing but very effective. You could see that he would probably usher in a more hardcore crime element in the neighborhood. So I breathed a sigh of relief when C said he would be &quot;giving the bar a rest.&quot;Since I didn't live in the Bronx during the 1960's, I can't speak for how racial matters were handled. But I found the inclusion of the interracial romance to be well-handled. There was just enough tension and violence to let viewers know that the neighborhood wasn't a racial utopia; but at the same time, the film showed what might have happened--or probably happened, but wasn't talked about much.I think both Taral Hicks (who played Jane) and Lillo Bracato (who played the teenaged C) did a good job of portraying teenage love in an awkward and sweet way. I don't know about anybody else, but I was PLEADING for Jane to pull that door lock up! (Remember Sonny's door test?)Overall, I rank this movie up there at the top as one of the great ones (though severely underappreciated) of all time. Robert De Niro is at his best in this film, though his part seems small. Chazz Palmentieri is also excellent. I wish he would write more screenplays, and allow De Niro to direct.This movie presents themes that anyone (not necessarily any one ethnic group) can relate to, even in 2001. Everything in life is not up or down or left or right. There are gray areas in life that we all struggle with. I think this film does a good job of showing this universal struggle.",5,Very Satisfying!,978393600,"01 2, 2001",2001,2567,"['movie', 'long', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'final', 'credits', 'roll', 'know', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'great', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'say', 'Bronx', 'Tale', 'such', 'movie.This', 'story', 'C', 'struggle', 'balance', 'love', 'hardworking', 'father', 'Lorenzo', 'neighborhood', 'mob', 'boss', 'Sonny', 'beginning', 'end', 'appreciate', 'how', 'Sonny', 'not', 'written', 'off', 'two-bit', 'hood', 'first', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'did', ""n't"", 'succumb', 'usual', 'mobster', 'stereotypes', 'abhored', 'violence', 'quot', 'life', 'quot', 'was', 'touched', 'Sonny', 'humanity.One', 'most', 'touching', 'moments', 'film', 'many', 'was', 'when', 'C', 'seemed', 'agonize', 'sitting', 'nosebleed', 'section', 'father', 'boxing', 'match', 'sitting', 'Sonny', 'ringside', 'seat', 'C', 'obviously', 'wanted', 'go', 'down', 'ringside', 'seemed', 'love', 'respect', 'father', 'so', 'much', 'apologized', 'father', 'stayed', 'put', 'How', 'many', 'teenagers', 'would', 'do', 'today', 'least', 'do', 'so', 'as', 'much', 'respect', 'humbleness', 'opposed', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'smarting', 'off.Joe', 'Pesci', 'appearance', 'end', 'was', 'disturbing', 'very', 'effective', 'could', 'see', 'would', 'probably', 'usher', 'more', 'hardcore', 'crime', 'element', 'neighborhood', 'breathed', 'sigh', 'relief', 'when', 'C', 'said', 'would', 'be', 'quot', 'giving', 'bar', 'rest.', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'Bronx', '1960', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'how', 'racial', 'matters', 'were', 'handled', 'found', 'inclusion', 'interracial', 'romance', 'be', 'well-handled', 'was', 'just', 'enough', 'tension', 'violence', 'let', 'viewers', 'know', 'neighborhood', 'was', ""n't"", 'racial', 'utopia', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'showed', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'probably', 'happened', 'was', ""n't"", 'talked', 'much.I', 'think', 'Taral', 'Hicks', 'who', 'played', 'Jane', 'Lillo', 'Bracato', 'who', 'played', 'teenaged', 'C', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'teenage', 'love', 'awkward', 'sweet', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anybody', 'else', 'was', 'PLEADING', 'Jane', 'pull', 'door', 'up', 'Remember', 'Sonny', 'door', 'test', 'Overall', 'rank', 'movie', 'up', 'there', 'top', 'one', 'great', 'ones', 'severely', 'underappreciated', 'time', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'best', 'film', 'part', 'small', 'Chazz', 'Palmentieri', 'also', 'excellent', 'wish', 'would', 'write', 'more', 'screenplays', 'allow', 'De', 'Niro', 'direct.This', 'movie', 'presents', 'anyone', 'not', 'necessarily', 'one', 'ethnic', 'group', 'can', 'relate', 'even', '2001', 'Everything', 'life', 'not', 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right', 'are', 'gray', 'areas', 'life', 'struggle', 'think', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'universal', 'struggle']",N/A
