1071250,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B000PHX4S8,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[2, 3]","The extraordinary life and times of Allen Ginsberg are profiled in this straightforward tribute documentary. I can't recall gaining any new insights or knowledge of Ginsberg, *but* I had already done my homework on the Beats and all that when, like so many others, I was a fascinated teenager. What I did experience was again being made aware of how much Ginsgerg's life connected with and that it was better through his having been a part of it. Not only was he a Beat poet but a great muse to many, many artists. I dare say I find that aspect of his life the most interesting. America is better because Ginsberg lived. He was a peacemaker, an activist, and a really nice and lovable guy. This film serves as a solid introduction to the famous countercultural icon's story as it is told with ample footage and through many interviews with his many famous friends and admirers: Beck, Bono, Paul McCartney, Yoko Ono, Johnny Depp, Hunter S. Thompson, Andy Warhol, Patti Smith, Joan Baez, Michael McClure, Norman Mailer, Amiri Baraka, Ken Kesey, William S. Burroughs, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Anne Waldman and Timothy Leary... Excerpts of discussions with William Buckley and Dick Cavett are also included. The DVD set includes over 6 hours of extras.

1071251,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000PHX4S8,Alfred Johnson,"[3, 5]","Recently I have been in a ""beat"" generation literary frame of mind. It all started last summer when I happened to be in Lowell, Massachusetts on some personal business. Although I have more than a few old time connections with that now worn out mill town I had not been there for some time. While walking in the downtown area I found myself crossing a small park adjacent to the site of a well-known mill museum and restored textile factory space. Needless to say, at least for any reader with a sense of literary history, at that park I found some very interesting memorial stones inscribed with excerpts from a number of his better known works dedicated to Lowell's ""bad boy"", the ""king of the 1950s beat writers, Jack Kerouac. And, just as naturally, when one thinks of Kerouac then Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, Gregory Corso, Neal Cassidy and a whole ragtag assortment of poets, hangers-on, groupies and genuine madmen and madwomen come to mind. So that is why we are under the sign of one Allen Ginsberg.As I pointed out in recent review of a film documentary about the life of Jack Kerouac, ""What Happened To Kerouac? (which I gave a five-star rating to, by the way) I was just a little too young to be directly influenced by the ""beats"", and just a little too driven by the quest for political solutions for what ailed me and what I thought ailed this society. Nevertheless, as I recounted in that review entitled, ""On The Road"" And On The Sidelines"", after I came of political age I kind of crept back, like a million other members of the ""Generation of `68"" and re-evaluated that influence. In short then, starting with Kerouac's ""On The Road"", through William Burroughs ""Naked Lunch"" and on to Ginsberg's madman-like, but provocative, ""Howl"" and sensitive ""Kaddish"" I devoured every ""beat"" thing I could get my hands on.And that last sentence is a good place to start in reviewing this one and one half hour production about the trials and tribulations, the fight for literary recognition and the journey of discovery of one hell of a beat poet, Allen Ginsberg. The film speeds through the now rather familiar saga (for that generation that was born between World War I and II and formed the core of what is deemed ""the greatest generation"") of a dysfunctional Jewish immigrant family, additionally burdened by a very overwrought and frequently institutionalized mother. The real story for our purposes, however, starts in 1940s New York where some very alienated youth like Ginsberg, Kerouac, Holmes, etc. and their mentors like Burroughs meet up  and start a quest, literarily and physically, to `discover' America. And they do it on their terms, at least for a while.Along the way Ginsberg becomes very aware of his innate poetic skills, his previously submerged sexual orientation and his almost surreal sense of the absurdities of living in post-war America, at least on the ""squares"" terms. Things begin to happen though. His ""Howl"" is premiered in San Francisco in 1956 to critical acclaim, Kerouac's ""On The Road"" finally gets published to rave reviews and suddenly in Eisenhower's America it becomes almost a rite of passage for the young to show up at some poetry reading in some smoky caf&eacute;, or dress in the de rigueur black, or like black-driven jazz. And that is where my generation and I come in. That is where, if nothing else, we owe a debt to the beats- and to the king hell beat poet who, unlike Kerouac who couldn't, or wouldn't, make the transition, came over with us when we started pushing back.And that is the positive side of the Ginsberg story, the ability to transition, as least partially, as the leftward cultural currents shifted. I would not, and I believe psychologically could not, go on that psychic consciousness-raising trip that led him to Buddhism for a while. Moreover, in viewing the film of his role in the 1968 Democratic Convention as a messenger of tranquility only brought the hard fact that that was not the way to fight the monster home. But, I was then as I am now very indulgent toward the poetic spirits, the protest song singers, and the other cultural figures who ""rage against the monster"", politically correct or not.  What bothered me more than anything though was Ginsberg's fate in his later career when he was no longer front and center in the public eye. In one of the many Ginsberg interview segments that dot this documentary, which was produced in 1994 just a few years before he died he notes, I believe while he is reciting one of his poems that one of his life achievements that he was proud of was that his had become a distinguished professor (I assume, of literature) at Brooklyn College. That is an unpardonable sin Brother Ginsberg. Where did you go wrong?Note: One of the great things about this documentary, from a personal perspective, were the great number of evocative photographs, including many taken by the closet ""shutter-bug"" Ginsberg himself, of various personalities of the ""beat"" generation that I had not seen before like the young Ginsberg, Burroughs (was he ever young?), Cassidy and Kerouac. Additionally, for poetry buffs, there are number of segments included where Ginsberg read from his works (and with his poet father in join readings, as well). You do not know how really good and provocative ""Howl"" and ""Kaddish"" are as poems of rage and remembrance, respectively, until you hear his readings",4,"From ""Howl"" To OM",1252800000,"09 13,

From everything I've ever read about Allen Ginsberg, the one enduring fact of his life is that he always manifested a genius for self-promotion. The likes of Kerouac and Cassidy detrained into the swamp yet he managed to redefine himself and become one with whatever movement or era would have otherwise passed him by. He was a natural magnet for attention and made full use of whatever talents he had. Indeed, the man surpassed every expectation based on his potential. I thought this was a solid documentary and found the footage of his father to be quite interesting.

1071256,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,B000PHX4S8,Kerry Walters,"[8, 10]","There are two features of Ginsberg's personality that come through over and over in this intriguing documentary:  he was a deeply wounded man, and he was a deeply lovable one.  The two were obviously connected:  Ginsberg's wounds made him both vulnerable and compassionate.  They could also make him rage against a world that condoned war and injustice, and all of these sides of him come through in his poetry.Ginsberg's ur-wound was the tragedy of his mother, a remarkable woman who sadly suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, was in and out of institutions during Ginsberg's youth, and finally died in one.  As a boy, Ginsberg was frequently charged with her care.  As his stepmother says in the film, he was exposed to way too much for a young boy to take in.  His feelings of helplessness, frustration, impatience, love, guilt, and fear in the face of his mom's illness and increasingly bizarre behavior marked him for life.  Thankfully, his relationship with his father Louis, a lyric poet, was one of tenderness, mutual respect, and deep love.Ginsberg's unhappy relationship with his mother, as well as his genesis from beat poet to cosmic poet to Buddhist poet to grand old man of American poetry is tracked in the film.  Especially welcome are the long and marvelous clips of Ginsberg reading his poetry:  long sections of ""Howl,"" all of ""Kaddish,"" and others, sometimes put in music.  There's also a clip from Ginsberg's appearance on Buckley's ""Firing Line,"" in which the two men stood one another down.  Lots of vintage still photography and cinema featuring the beat poets round out the documentary.The one thing missing in the film was more than a brief mention of Ginsberg's lifelong relationship with Peter Orlovsky.  Ginsberg does say at one point, quite touchingly, that he and Peter made life vows to one another, and a rather vague reference to Orlovsky's later mental and alcohol troubles is made.  But the relationship is for the most part passed over in silence.A good film, both for fans of Ginsberg's poetry and those who know it only by hearsay.

1071257,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000PHX4S8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 4]","This DVD release of ""The Life and Times of Allen Ginsberg"" might catch your eye if you are a fan of the poet and revolutionary.  The film itself premiered as part of the PBS American Masters series in 1994 after its run on the festival circuit in 1993.  It has been released in DVD form on different occasions, most recently in 2007 to align with the fiftieth anniversary of ""Howl.""  That 2 disc set combined both the movie feature with over six hours (yes, six) of Bonus features.  That edition and the previous ones have been out of print for some time, so Docurama is picking up the mantle and re-releasing the picture.  I mention all of this to clarify that this is NOT a new title.  You may have seen it and you may already own it.  This release is exactly the same in content as the 2007 DVD, so please do not double dip.  If, however, you new to the Ginsberg phenomenon or have not seen the movie than it is an easy recommendation.At 84 minutes, the movie itself is but a snap shot of Ginsberg and his accomplishments.  There is far more comprehensive material to be found if you are so inclined.  There is nothing particularly noteworthy about the style of the film, it is fairly straightforward in presentation.  Some areas of focus include the Beat Generation period and his development of friendships with William S. Burroughs and Jack Kerouac.  His rise to activism in the fifties and sixties gets solid coverage, his thoughtful challenges to the status quo and his connection with Timothy Leary are also explored.  Perhaps the culmination of his protests occurred with the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago.  The film also addresses the personal side of Ginsberg including his sexuality and how that influenced him in his role.Filmmaker Jerry Aronson compiled material about Ginsberg for 25 years.  While the movie is a nice, albeit brief, introduction, true enthusiasts will want to check out the DVD Bonus material.  While I would give the movie four stars, the DVD is really a five star affair due to the sheer scope of additional material.

I admit I knew little about him, and as years passed and life went on, he wasn't prominent in my memory. I recently saw ""Howl"", which mostly centered on his obscenity trial, but also included references to the man's motivations. ""The Life and Times..."" fills in any holes, especially regarding his activism, as well as his profound love and respect toward his parents. The 2 films, I think, compliment each other well. Allen is as complex as he is simple, depending on the issue; an enigma among American literary champions. Worth watching.
