I do not appreciate all the sex scenes - it like they do not know how to make good movies without that or filthy language.

I was very impressed with Nicole Kidman's acting. It's like she was born to be an actress. This movie is about a windsurfer who gets shaken up, and the people who love him get him back on track. Unlike other movies of this kind, where sometimes the main character wins the competition, or doesn't but is considered a hero anyway (like Karate Kid), there is no ending to this movie. It's like the director was told at the last minute that the movie time had to be shortened, so they just cut the end off - a real injustice to an otherwise fun movie.",4,Worth the watch,1380585600,"10 1, 2013",2013,651,"['story', 'line', 'been', 'done', 'anyone', 'who', 'surf', 'will', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'acting', 'was', 'born', 'be', 'actress', 'movie', 'windsurfer', 'who', 'shaken', 'up', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'other', 'movies', 'kind', 'where', 'sometimes', 'main', 'character', 'competition', ""n't"", 'considered', 'hero', 'anyway', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'ending', 'movie', 'director', 'was', 'told', 'last', 'minute', 'movie', 'time', 'had', 'be', 'shortened', 'just', 'cut', 'end', 'off', 'real', 'injustice', 'otherwise', 'fun', 'movie']",Windrider
