1671904,A3CW0ZLUO5X2B1,B00FL1BHTG,"35-year Technology Consumer ""8-tracks to 802.11""","[0, 0]","""Watchtower"" is not a movie for the impatient or faint of heart. Its pacing is deliberate and its central narrative is an extremely mature theme. But if you are looking for a respite from the predictable formulas of Hollywood offerings, and if you can get your payoff from spectacular cinematography and patient, non-judgmental looks at characters in crisis, you will find this movie richly rewarding.I am going light on plot details here: too many will spoil what unfolds in this movie. Set in the alpine region of north-central Turkey, ""Watchtower"" follows the paths of two people. The man (Nihat) has taken a job at fire observation tower. Although some ""guards"" (as they call themselves) break up their solitary existence with visits from family, many --including Nihat-- spend their time in their cabins by themselves. Nihat is there alone by choice, following a recent personal tragedy. His interaction with his peers is by radio, and key plot features are indeed revealed during some of these radio communications. Down the mountain at a rural. The film's co-protagonist is a young woman (Seher) who works downhill from Nihat's mountain. She has recently left her university studies, and is living an ascetic life of her own. She works for a small bus service (first as an onboard attendant, later cooking at the small mountain bus station where she also lives).What follows their meeting is a superb examination of two people in crisis. They are both forced to face the results of their past actions (and the actions of others) as they deal with the fallout today and consider their futures. Pay close attention to the themes of loneliness and isolation, even as unfolding events force these two together.Invest the 100 minutes it takes to watch this tale unfold; you won't be disappointed.This movie is unrated, but would almost certainly be pinned with ""R"" if it were. The plot themes are extremely adult, and occasionally, so is some of the language. There is brief partial nudity, but it is not gratuitous and is essential to advancing the story.The DVD also contains a short film. Ironically, the full-length Turkish drama is accompanied by a lighthearted Greek tale of a small seaside village plotting to add a new resident to avoid loss of government services. Charming on its own, it will be appreciated an extra measure by those who have spent time in Greece (or with Greeks anyplace).This is an offering from the Film Movement series; Film Movement provided a copy for review purposes.",5,"Dramatic, measured examination of the intersection of two lives...",1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,2503,"['Watchtower', 'not', 'movie', 'impatient', 'faint', 'heart', 'pacing', 'deliberate', 'central', 'narrative', 'extremely', 'mature', 'theme', 'are', 'looking', 'respite', 'predictable', 'formulas', 'Hollywood', 'offerings', 'can', 'get', 'payoff', 'spectacular', 'cinematography', 'patient', 'non-judgmental', 'looks', 'characters', 'crisis', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'richly', 'am', 'going', 'light', 'plot', 'details', 'here', 'too', 'many', 'will', 'spoil', 'what', 'movie', 'Set', 'alpine', 'region', 'north-central', 'Turkey', 'Watchtower', 'paths', 'two', 'people', 'man', 'Nihat', 'taken', 'job', 'fire', 'observation', 'tower', 'guards', 'call', 'break', 'up', 'solitary', 'existence', 'visits', 'family', 'many', 'including', 'Nihat', 'spend', 'time', 'cabins', 'Nihat', 'there', 'alone', 'choice', 'following', 'recent', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'interaction', 'peers', 'radio', 'key', 'plot', 'features', 'are', 'indeed', 'revealed', 'radio', 'communications', 'mountain', 'rural', 'film', 'co-protagonist', 'young', 'woman', 'Seher', 'who', 'downhill', 'Nihat', 'mountain', 'recently', 'left', 'university', 'studies', 'living', 'ascetic', 'life', 'own', 'small', 'bus', 'service', 'first', 'onboard', 'attendant', 'later', 'cooking', 'small', 'mountain', 'bus', 'station', 'where', 'also', 'meeting', 'superb', 'examination', 'two', 'people', 'crisis', 'are', 'forced', 'face', 'results', 'past', 'actions', 'actions', 'others', 'deal', 'fallout', 'today', 'consider', 'futures', 'Pay', 'close', 'attention', 'themes', 'loneliness', 'isolation', 'even', 'unfolding', 'events', 'force', 'two', 'together.Invest', '100', 'minutes', 'watch', 'tale', 'unfold', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.This', 'movie', 'unrated', 'would', 'almost', 'certainly', 'be', 'pinned', 'R', 'were', 'plot', 'themes', 'are', 'extremely', 'adult', 'occasionally', 'so', 'language', 'brief', 'partial', 'nudity', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'essential', 'advancing', 'story.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'short', 'film', 'Ironically', 'full-length', 'Turkish', 'drama', 'accompanied', 'lighthearted', 'Greek', 'tale', 'small', 'seaside', 'village', 'plotting', 'add', 'new', 'resident', 'avoid', 'loss', 'government', 'services', 'Charming', 'own', 'will', 'be', 'appreciated', 'extra', 'measure', 'who', 'have', 'spent', 'time', 'Greece', 'Greeks', 'anyplace', '.This', 'offering', 'Film', 'Movement', 'series', 'Film', 'Movement', 'provided', 'copy', 'review', 'purposes']",Watchtower

Not because the dialog is bad but because the stunning visuals and impactful verbal messages carry a power that is both subtle and substantial. Federico Fellini comes to mind though I don't know why since he wasn't Turkish. :)Normally I don't like movies where nothing (no action or witty repartee) happens because... well nothing happens. This film (catch the change) is an excellent example of how to fill the spaces with something other than CGI effects. Usually I can't wait for the end and in this case I expect to watch it several times.I was provided with a copy of the DVD so I could provide my review.,4,It's what happens between the lines,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,699,"['more', 'time', 'spent', 'actors', 'not', 'speaking', 'good', 'thing', 'Not', 'dialog', 'bad', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'impactful', 'verbal', 'messages', 'carry', 'power', 'subtle', 'substantial', 'Federico', 'Fellini', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'Turkish', 'Normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movies', 'where', 'nothing', 'action', 'witty', 'repartee', 'well', 'nothing', 'film', 'catch', 'change', 'excellent', 'example', 'how', 'fill', 'spaces', 'something', 'other', 'CGI', 'effects', 'Usually', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'end', 'case', 'expect', 'watch', 'several', 'times.I', 'was', 'provided', 'copy', 'DVD', 'could', 'provide', 'review']",Watchtower
1671906,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00FL1BHTG,Charles Ashbacher,"[1, 2]","Although it starts slow, once this movie gets going it hits your emotions with the power of a cricket bat swung by a pro. It opens with Nihat taking a job as a fire warden in a remote forest observation tower. Nihat is by himself and it is clear that he wants it that way. He communicates with others but only when necessary and he engages in no unnecessary conversation. Therefore, the viewer is given the impression that something very bad has happened in his life but no specifics are given.Seher has taken a job as a hostess on a remote bus line that goes on the road nearest to the watchtower and it is the one that Nihat took to get to his job. As was the case with Nihat, it is clear that there was some trauma in her life as well, but at first you do not know. However, the hints as to what went wrong in Seher's life come more quickly than those in Nihat's until the answer is given in an explosive confrontation with her mother.It is impossible to explain the circumstances of Seher's problem without stating a spoiler, but if that is not given it is impossible to explain the power of the movie, so I will give it away. Seher was raped by her mother's brother and is pregnant. Therefore, her trauma is devastating, she has no place to turn, no one to go to and her mother's unwillingness to deal with the situation means that she is truly alone with an unmanageable problem. The intense emotional conflict that Seher feels of love and hate regarding the baby quickly translates into significant empathy from the viewer. From the point of revelation, you really care what happens to Seher.Through some circumstances, Nihat comes to Seher's assistance, creating an unusual domestic partnership and once it has started, we learn the tragedy of Nihat's life. When he learns the origin of Seher's problems, Nihat seems lost at what to do other than allowing Seher to stay longer at his watchtower and coming in out of the rain. The ending is completely ambiguous as there is no resolution of the issues as to what either one of them does next. Some will hate such an ending, but I found it interesting, for after it was over I spent some time trying to determine what kind of happy ending could have been generated.While it takes some time before you begin to feel for them, once you do the emotional attraction is powerful as your empathy genes kick in and you strongly want Seher and Nihat to find something to right their lost ships of life. At the end, they both may have done that. Pregnancy as a consequence of incestual rape is one of the most difficult topics to deal with and the makers of this film are to be commended for taking it on straight up.",5,Trauma in their lives brings two people together?,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,2664,"['slow', 'once', 'movie', 'going', 'emotions', 'power', 'cricket', 'bat', 'swung', 'pro', 'Nihat', 'taking', 'job', 'fire', 'warden', 'remote', 'forest', 'observation', 'tower', 'Nihat', 'clear', 'way', 'others', 'only', 'when', 'necessary', 'unnecessary', 'conversation', 'Therefore', 'viewer', 'given', 'impression', 'something', 'very', 'bad', 'happened', 'life', 'specifics', 'are', 'given.Seher', 'taken', 'job', 'hostess', 'remote', 'bus', 'line', 'road', 'nearest', 'watchtower', 'one', 'Nihat', 'took', 'get', 'job', 'was', 'case', 'Nihat', 'clear', 'was', 'trauma', 'life', 'well', 'first', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'However', 'hints', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'Seher', 'life', 'come', 'more', 'quickly', 'Nihat', 'answer', 'given', 'explosive', 'confrontation', 'mother.It', 'impossible', 'explain', 'circumstances', 'Seher', 'problem', 'stating', 'spoiler', 'not', 'given', 'impossible', 'explain', 'power', 'movie', 'will', 'give', 'away', 'Seher', 'was', 'raped', 'mother', 'brother', 'pregnant', 'Therefore', 'trauma', 'devastating', 'place', 'turn', 'one', 'go', 'mother', 'unwillingness', 'deal', 'situation', 'truly', 'alone', 'unmanageable', 'problem', 'intense', 'emotional', 'conflict', 'Seher', 'feels', 'love', 'hate', 'regarding', 'baby', 'quickly', 'significant', 'empathy', 'viewer', 'point', 'revelation', 'really', 'care', 'what', 'Seher.Through', 'circumstances', 'Nihat', 'Seher', 'assistance', 'creating', 'unusual', 'domestic', 'partnership', 'once', 'started', 'learn', 'tragedy', 'Nihat', 'life', 'When', 'origin', 'Seher', 'problems', 'Nihat', 'lost', 'what', 'do', 'other', 'allowing', 'Seher', 'stay', 'longer', 'watchtower', 'coming', 'rain', 'ending', 'completely', 'ambiguous', 'resolution', 'issues', 'what', 'one', 'next', 'will', 'hate', 'such', 'ending', 'found', 'interesting', 'was', 'spent', 'time', 'trying', 'determine', 'what', 'kind', 'happy', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'generated.While', 'time', 'begin', 'feel', 'once', 'do', 'emotional', 'attraction', 'powerful', 'empathy', 'genes', 'kick', 'strongly', 'want', 'Seher', 'Nihat', 'find', 'something', 'right', 'lost', 'ships', 'life', 'end', 'may', 'have', 'done', 'Pregnancy', 'consequence', 'incestual', 'rape', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'topics', 'deal', 'makers', 'film', 'are', 'be', 'commended', 'taking', 'straight', 'up']",Watchtower
1671907,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00FL1BHTG,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Nothing happens but everything happens in this subtle quiet film from Turkey. I love films that move deliberately, take care with camera work, framing, and editing, and then develop into something remarkable. Like a great friendship, it takes a while to know the two main characters in this film. The director foreshadows their meeting and events with subtle cues early in the film.This is an incredibly simple film; Nihat starts a job as the lone person in a watchtower. Seher is the hostess for a bus company; apparently in Turkey buses have the equivalent of a flight attendant. The film alternates back and forth from Nihat to Seher. Each time a little more is revealed about each character. Before long we know a lot about each person and what they've gone through to get them into the isolated situation they are in.This is a film about isolation and trying to leave or deal with the past. The scenery is stunning; the watchtower is at the top of a mountain, completely isolated from anything. The camera work is incredible. The characters are framed in the exact spot necessary for the story - there is a subtle and deliberate progression of the characters from the right side of the screen into the center when they were most vulnerable, and finally to the left side. Cameras are rock solid, the focus is perfect, and the colors and exposure exactly right. This is so rare in independent film. The director chose subtle cues to show the passage of time.Although there is very little dialog in the film, the two lead characters are incredible actors. They say more with a look or expression on their faces than words could ever communicate.The film is not rated. There are a few brief moments where a woman's breast is exposed and another of a naked woman curled up in a small room. Each scene is done in good taste, something young mature viewers should find perfectly natural. There is a scene where a woman gives birth, but she is fully clothed. Otherwise this film would be acceptable for all audiences. The film is presented in Turkish with English subtitles.This is a gorgeous film that is probably not for everybody. It moves slowly and deliberately. The film was not long to me at 100 minutes. The ending is a mystery and is like great literature - it doesn't wrap everything up in a nice neat bow, like Hollywood would do; instead it leaves so many questions unanswered. And yet, it is an incredibly satisfying ending.Film Movement includes a short on the DVD. Foreigner is a 17 minute story about a Greek town that will lose its town status if they don't get one more inhabitant by the end of the week. It is a reasonably good film. I disliked that the film was brown - for some reason the color balance was way off and the film had an overall brown look to it. The music made it seem like it should be funny, but in fact it wasn't very funny. The short does match up well with Watchtower. Be sure to stick around until after the credits roll, there is a little surprise at the end.I was provided a review copy.",5,Slow Deliberate Gorgeous Film,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,3028,"['Nothing', 'everything', 'subtle', 'quiet', 'film', 'Turkey', 'love', 'films', 'move', 'deliberately', 'take', 'care', 'camera', 'work', 'framing', 'editing', 'then', 'develop', 'something', 'remarkable', 'great', 'friendship', 'while', 'know', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'director', 'meeting', 'events', 'subtle', 'cues', 'early', 'film.This', 'incredibly', 'simple', 'film', 'Nihat', 'job', 'lone', 'person', 'watchtower', 'hostess', 'bus', 'company', 'apparently', 'Turkey', 'buses', 'have', 'equivalent', 'flight', 'attendant', 'film', 'back', 'forth', 'Nihat', 'Seher', 'time', 'little', 'more', 'revealed', 'character', 'long', 'know', 'lot', 'person', 'what', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'get', 'isolated', 'situation', 'are', 'in.This', 'film', 'isolation', 'trying', 'leave', 'deal', 'past', 'scenery', 'stunning', 'watchtower', 'top', 'mountain', 'completely', 'isolated', 'anything', 'camera', 'work', 'incredible', 'characters', 'are', 'framed', 'exact', 'spot', 'necessary', 'story', 'subtle', 'deliberate', 'progression', 'characters', 'right', 'side', 'screen', 'center', 'when', 'were', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'finally', 'left', 'side', 'Cameras', 'are', 'rock', 'solid', 'focus', 'perfect', 'colors', 'exposure', 'exactly', 'right', 'so', 'rare', 'independent', 'film', 'director', 'chose', 'subtle', 'cues', 'show', 'passage', 'time.Although', 'very', 'little', 'dialog', 'film', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'incredible', 'actors', 'say', 'more', 'look', 'expression', 'words', 'could', 'ever', 'communicate.The', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'are', 'few', 'brief', 'moments', 'where', 'woman', 'breast', 'exposed', 'naked', 'woman', 'curled', 'up', 'small', 'room', 'scene', 'done', 'good', 'taste', 'something', 'young', 'mature', 'viewers', 'should', 'find', 'perfectly', 'natural', 'scene', 'where', 'woman', 'birth', 'fully', 'clothed', 'Otherwise', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'acceptable', 'audiences', 'film', 'presented', 'Turkish', 'English', 'subtitles.This', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'probably', 'not', 'everybody', 'slowly', 'deliberately', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'long', '100', 'minutes', 'ending', 'mystery', 'like', 'great', 'literature', ""n't"", 'wrap', 'everything', 'up', 'nice', 'neat', 'bow', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'do', 'instead', 'so', 'many', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'yet', 'incredibly', 'satisfying', 'ending.Film', 'Movement', 'short', 'DVD', 'Foreigner', '17', 'minute', 'story', 'Greek', 'town', 'will', 'lose', 'town', 'status', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'more', 'inhabitant', 'end', 'week', 'reasonably', 'good', 'film', 'disliked', 'film', 'was', 'brown', 'reason', 'color', 'balance', 'was', 'way', 'film', 'had', 'overall', 'brown', 'look', 'music', 'made', 'seem', 'should', 'be', 'funny', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'funny', 'short', 'match', 'up', 'well', 'Watchtower', 'Be', 'sure', 'stick', 'around', 'credits', 'roll', 'little', 'surprise', 'end.I', 'was', 'provided', 'review', 'copy']",Watchtower
1671908,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00FL1BHTG,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","Foreign films can be a mixed bag.  Often times, I&#8217;ve praised the fact that &#8211; because they&#8217;re made without the creative shackles of the American studio system &#8211; they tend to be raw and unfiltered portrayals of what the people of distant lands deal with in the day-to-day.  While I stand by my own interpretation, I&#8217;d also have to say that there are times when a guiding hand (like said studio system) could help refine a particular vision if only to the point that a motion picture&#8217;s core message might get broader acceptance.Such is quite possibly the case with WATCHTOWER.  It&#8217;s a terrific performance piece, punctuated by two great low-key performances that probably won&#8217;t register on the global radar because so very much of it is built on little moments.  Whereas big name actors get all the raves these days for doing the same, a foreign release needs to hit one out of the park to garner more international attention; otherwise, they&#8217;ll garner mostly just the praise of (basically) their neighbors, which this little gem certainly did.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Nihat (played with a kind of smoldering intensity by Olgun Simsek) has lost his way.  Emotionally decimated by an automobile accident (of his cause) that took the lives of his wife and child, he&#8217;s taken the unforgiving job of serving in a &#8216;watchtower&#8217; &#8211; a wilderness outpost monitoring the endless forest terrain for forest fires, accidents, and the like.  His only communication with the outside world is by radio or by occasional trips for foodstuffs and other supplies to a nearby bus terminal.  There, he crosses paths with the much younger Seher (a lovely Nilay Erdonmez), the bus&#8217;s host who&#8217;s fled big city life with a life-changing secret.  Through an odd twist of fate, the two will find another first as strangers but gradually a kinship will push the two of them past their grief into one of the oddest dependent relationships captured on film.WATCHTOWER is, largely, the kind of film most audiences dismiss because either (a) they don&#8217;t partake of foreign films or (b) it probably looks too artsy.  Thematically, I could argue that it has striking similarities with, say, JUNO (2007) without all of its dripping American derisiveness and crowd-friendly cynicism.  Instead, it takes the same idea &#8211; a young woman&#8217;s out-of-wedlock birth &#8211; and strips it bare, relieving the story of artifice and banality so that it can be inserted culturally with an entirely different people.  As a result, what you have is something that&#8217;s equal parts artistic though debatably more disturbing.Whereas JUNO&#8217;s character flaws are encapsulated in the typical saccharin writing of Diablo Cody, WATCHTOWER&#8217;s flaws are more relatable.  Nihat&#8217;s grief turns him to a world of forced isolation, and Seher&#8217;s angst leads her to make some unspeakable decisions.  They&#8217;re both in flight away from a kind of personal tragedy &#8211; one which brings a child into the world &#8211; and it&#8217;s only when they find one another that they&#8217;re forced to make decisions in the best interest of themselves as well as the greater society behind their own little private Idaho &#8230; well, their own private little Turkey (the country where the picture is set).Director Pelin Esmer has crafted a film with themes that should be universal, and it&#8217;s no wonder that this debut has scored some great acclaim from those who measure prominence.  While the film&#8217;s pacing it understandably slow, I think it easily could&#8217;ve been trimmed a bit here and there in order to get that 100 minutes down to under 90 and nothing would&#8217;ve been sacrificed.  If anything, it&#8217;d be in a condition better for American audiences.  That, and, were I a betting man, some studio suit would&#8217;ve asked for a more conclusive ending; WATCHTOWER kinda/sorta just ends &#8230; which is a good thing if you were sponsoring a Q&A; right after.  But as a film with a message?  I would&#8217;ve liked to see some final moment of acceptance from these two gifted players.Maybe that&#8217;s what makes me an American.Lastly, I&#8217;d be remiss in my duties if I failed to point out that WATCHTOWER received five awards from the Adana Golden Roll Film Festival, including Best Director for Esmer&#8217;s work.  At the 2013 Fribourg International Film Festival, the film won Don Quixote Award (Special Mention) and Ecumenical Jury Award (Special Mention) as well as being nominated for the Grand Prix.  At the 2013 Goteberg Film Festival, dir. Esmer received a nomination for the International Debut Award.  At the 2013 Nuremberg Film Festival, Ms. Erdonmez took home Best Actress honors while the film scored a nomination for Best Picture.  Lastly, at the 2013 Rotterdam Film Festival, dir. Esmer picked up a nomination for the Tiger Award.WATCHTOWER [2012] is produced by Sinefilm, Bredok Filmproduction, and Arizona Films.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled by Film Movement (a distributor with a terrific catalog).  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a Turkish-spoken-language film with English subtitles; there is no English-dubbed track available (thank the Heavens!).  As for the technical specifications, the film boasts some high quality sights and sounds from start-to-finish, and there&#8217;s even some surprisingly lush cinematography coopting from some largely passable locales and shooting locations.  If it&#8217;s special features you&#8217;re looking for, there is a bonus short film (&#8220;The Foreigner&#8221; by dir. Alethea Avramis), as well as some liner notes reviewing the film&#8217;s selection as part of Film Movement&#8217;s releases and excerpts from an interview with dir. Esmer.RECOMMENDED.  Pelin Esmer&#8217;s WATCHTOWER is a bit of a puzzle, which honestly amounts to most of its charm.  It&#8217;s a romance, but there&#8217;s very little romantic about it.  It&#8217;s a performance piece highlighting some terrific work from its principles, but there&#8217;s very little pomp and circumstance on the surface as what&#8217;s conveyed emotionally here is far more by nuance than by grandstanding acting.  Albeit a bit long, WATCHTOWER is best with its quiet moments &#8211; of which there are many &#8211; and, when are two leads finally come together, it sacrifices its silence in favor of a brewing storm &#8211; literally and figuratively &#8211; that is the human experience.  A pleasant surprise, but it serves an ending that&#8217;s far more obtuse than it needed to be.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Film Movement provided me with a DVD copy of WATCHTOWER by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,Curious Final Moments Mildly Derails An Otherwise Brilliant Work,1393372800,"02 26,

1671909,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00FL1BHTG,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Turkish writer director Pelin Esmer as won many awards for this compelling film that deals with the results of trauma on the psyches and souls of two people whose lives have been jolted by trauma. With a very small cast, minimal dialogue from the two main characters, and a supporting ensemble offering realistic interpretations of the people outside the lives of the main characters, coupled with stunning photography of the Mountains of Turkey, this film leaves an indelible mark on the viewer.In contemporary Turkey we meet Nihat (Olgun Simsek), a quiet man suffering form the accidental loss of his wife and child in an accident in which he was the sole survivor. He exits the mainstream by becoming an isolated lookout fireguard in a watchtower in the mountains of Turkey. We also meet a beautiful but troubled young Seher (Nilay Erdonmez) who is in college but has taken on a job as a tour bus hostess, living in a crude bus station belonging to her uncle. We gradually learn that she is pregnant (morning sickness and enlarging girth), a fact she finally confesses to her poor but proud mother (Lain Ceylan) and father (Riza Akin) who are shocked by her deed. Seher distances herself further and eventually gives unattended birth to the child that resulted from a rape by her uncle. Seher cannot accept her fate, hides the newborn boy in the trash bin and sets out on foot to separate herself from everyone. Nihat, whom Seher has met while waitressing in the bus station, rescues her, takes her and the baby he has discovered to his tower where he nurtures them, encouraging Seher to breastfeed her own child. The interpersonal relationship between these two deeply bruised people and how they cope concludes this deeply moving film.In the hands of less talented actors this story would not gel, but the director and his gifted actors create a memorable, important film. In Turkish with English subtitles. Anther remarkable addition to the library of FilmMovement.

The film is a family drama that unfolds slowly but ultimately pays off, offering the viewer an intense psychological study that makes you want to know what will happen to its characters. It tells the story of the encounter between two lost souls in a remote watchtower in the Turkish mountains. The photography and scenery are amazing and the acting is very good as well.

As with all Film Movement releases, it is an official selection or winner at multiple film festivals.Nihat has taken a job as a fire warden, scanning the forest from an isolated tower high in the mountains. From the opening scenes, with his walk, his facial expressions and more, he telegraphs a sadness, a loss. The viewer senses that he wants to be alone, that this isolated job will let him escape somehow.Seher is a young woman who has taken a job as a bus hostess and is living in a small room at the rest stop. Her loneliness is also telegraphed with few words. She looks through pictures, picks up the phone to call someone, leaving only a vague message. Again, the viewer just knows that there is more to her story - that the bus stop is for her an escape as well.Nihat comes down the mountain for supplies and stops for tea at the restaurant. It is inevitable that the two meet. Each is indeed hiding something and their lives reluctantly become intertwined. We discover the reason each has retreated from life and watch as their lives are inexorably drawn together.There is little dialogue in Watchtower, rather it's the silence that speaks volumes, underlining the theme of isolation. The use of walkie talkies by the fire wardens was an effective device to underscore Nihat's isolation and the need to connect, to unburden, to share and to be part of a society.The background of the film is spectacular. The views from the watchtower are breath taking. I wonder if the house used was an actual warden station or if it was built for the film? I quite liked it and pictured myself living at the top of the mountain!I watched the ending more that once, deciding if it was what I wanted. And it was. This is one of my favourite films so far, one I would easily recommend. 2012 / Turkish with English subtitles / 100 minAs always, there's a short film included as a bonus. This time it's a 17 minute film from Greece called The Foreigner. A small village needs to up their population in order to keep receiving services from the state. When a tourist wanders into town, they try to convince him to stay. This short was excellent!

Nihat is a man who is escaping from life after a serious tragedy. He finds a job as a warden in a mountain top watchtower. His life is simple and isolated. Seher is an ex-college student who has experienced a traumatic event and is still in the process of dealing with it in secrecy. She finds a job as a hostess at a bus station near Nihat&#8217;s watchtower.As the story unfolds with each character, there is a point of intersection where Nihat has to intervene with Seher. What follows is a series of events and twists that find both characters questioning themselves and each other in respectful, surprising and honorable ways. It&#8217;s a story of morality, isolation and forgiveness. The ending is perfect.To give any more detail would be a great disservice to this film.

This is the October, 2013 release in that on-going series.""Watchtower"" (2012 release from Turkey; 96 min.) brings the story of two people whose paths eventually cross. We meet Nihat, a middle-aged man who as the film opens we see starting a new job as a forest fire guard in a watchtower near Tosya, a remote area of Turkey. We also get to know Seher, a young woman who has taken a job as a bus hostess for a regional bus company in Tosya. We learn that she recently left another city in Turkey, Bolu, without telling her parents, and is more or less in hiding in Tosya. It isn't much longer before it is revealed that Seher is pregnant, the reason she fled from her parents. Why is she hiding her pregnancy from her parents? Who is the father of the unborn baby? How will Nihat's and Seher's paths cross? To tell you more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, I purposefully didn't know much of this movie when I viewed it, and I was surprised (in the best of ways) to find (and also reason that I've kept my plot introduction to a minimum) that this is a complex and gripping family drama and relationship drama. The life circumstances of both the forest fire guard and the young woman will surely tug at your heart. (As to the fire guard, apparently Turkey uses them to monitor possible forest fires in remote areas.) Second, the movie's photography is nothing short of outstanding. Check out the 360 degree views from atop of the watchtower across the Tosya area, it looks like a postcard and make you want to go visit the area yourself. Last but certainly not least, the acting performances of the two leads will leave a deep impression on you, in particular the woman playing the role of Seher.As is usually the case, the DVD comes with a bonus shortie, and this month we get a 17 min. shortie from Greece called ""The Foreigner"", in which a small village tries to convince a foreign tourist to remain permanently. Pretty good too, in fact. It just adds to the viewing experience that is ""Watchtower"". ""Watchtower"" is a great addition to the ever-growing and rich Film Movement catalog of foreign and indie movie. Bottom line: ""Watchtower"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,4.5 stars...
