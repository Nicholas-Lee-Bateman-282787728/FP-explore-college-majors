Thirty-three years havealtered my opinion slightly but it's still not a favorite.Warren Beatty plays George Roundy a Las Angeles hairdresser who yearns for his own salon and becomes entangled in the lives of four different women and the man who is somehow connected to all of them. In order to get his loan George approaches businessman Lester Carp (Jack Warden). The problem is that George is sleeping with Lester's wife Felicia (Lee Grant), Lester's girlfriend Jackie (Julie Christie) and Lester's daughter Lorna (Carrie Fisher). George is also in the middle of a failing relationship with his own girlfriend Jill(Goldie Hawn). The confusion results in a sex comedy that AFI considers  one of the 100 most funny but the movie has lost quite a bit of its edge over the years.The disc I viewed was bare bones with no extras. Columbia's transfer was kind of grainy and soft and the mono sound while adequate  to the souce material was a little tinny.

385025,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6303686834,Dennis Littrell,"[4, 5]","Robert Towne, who has written a number of popular movies and at least one critically acclaimed one--Chinatown (1974)--and Warren Beatty wrote this satire of Hollywood.  Beatty plays George Roundy, a not entirely bright but nimble hairdresser on a motorcycle who is much beloved and desired by woman.  The women doing most of the desiring are Lee Grant (Felicia), Julie Christie (Jackie), and Goldie Hawn (Jill).  Jack Warden plays Lester a successful investor who, to his chagrin and ultimate amusement, learns that his wife, his mistress, and his daughter Lorna (Carrie Fisher) are being bedded by the guy he thinks is gay.  (Shades of the sham eunuch in the harem!)This is a premise that many in the Hollywood Hills could not resist, the irony cutting so beautifully through the canyons and swimming pools and the lavish parties.  Most of the action takes place on that November day in 1968 when Nixon and Agnew were swept into the White House by the ""silent majority.""  Lester and his friends are quite pleased and are celebrating as the election returns come in.  Meanwhile George is trying to raise money so he can open his own shop since he's got the ""heads.""  Keeping the heads though turns out to be more than he can handle--and to be honest jumping from bed to bed several times a day with several different women might be too much for any man.Will Georgie-Porgie, puddin' pie (who kissed the girls and made them cry) get the money for his shop and the girl he loves--and which girl is it, that he loves?  Goldie Hawn wears a micro-mini (but there's no peeking!) and Julie Christie sports a short pony skirt with boots while Lee Grant has to play the eldest woman.  Now, who gets George and would she really want him?Some nice sixties/seventies Hollywood decadence graces the screen along with free love and don't bogart that number.  In the background there are a lot of mug shots of Nixon and Agnew in juxtaposition as a kind of joke since the movie was made in 1975 not long after Watergate.Beatty, playing a role said to be patterned after makeup artist Jay Sebring, is competent and wins our sympathy, maybe because we know he's never going to amount to much.  Or does he?  Lee Grant won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress, but to be honest I thought Julie Christie was better, although they both were good.  Actors carried this with Warden and Hawn also putting in strong performances.Shampoo is not so much funny as it is amusing.  It's like a superior sit-com without the laugh track, but in no way is it a ""defining"" Hollywood film.See this for Warren Beatty, one of the Hollywood royalty, brother of Shirley MacLaine and husband of Annette Bening.",4,Casanova as a harried Hollywood hairdresser,1183334400,"07 2, 2007",2007,2667,"['Robert', 'Towne', 'who', 'written', 'number', 'popular', 'movies', 'least', 'one', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'one', 'Chinatown', '1974', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'wrote', 'satire', 'Hollywood', 'Beatty', 'George', 'Roundy', 'not', 'entirely', 'bright', 'nimble', 'hairdresser', 'motorcycle', 'who', 'much', 'beloved', 'desired', 'woman', 'women', 'doing', 'most', 'desiring', 'are', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'Felicia', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Jackie', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Jill', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'Lester', 'successful', 'investor', 'who', 'chagrin', 'ultimate', 'amusement', 'wife', 'mistress', 'daughter', 'Lorna', 'Carrie', 'Fisher', 'are', 'being', 'bedded', 'guy', 'gay', 'Shades', 'sham', 'eunuch', 'harem', 'premise', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'Hills', 'could', 'not', 'resist', 'irony', 'cutting', 'so', 'beautifully', 'canyons', 'swimming', 'pools', 'lavish', 'parties', 'Most', 'action', 'place', 'November', 'day', '1968', 'when', 'Nixon', 'Agnew', 'were', 'swept', 'White', 'House', 'silent', 'majority', 'Lester', 'friends', 'are', 'quite', 'pleased', 'are', 'celebrating', 'election', 'come', 'Meanwhile', 'George', 'trying', 'raise', 'money', 'can', 'open', 'own', 'shop', 'got', 'heads', 'Keeping', 'heads', 'turns', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'can', 'handle', 'be', 'honest', 'jumping', 'bed', 'bed', 'several', 'times', 'day', 'several', 'different', 'women', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'man.Will', 'Georgie-Porgie', 'puddin', 'pie', 'who', 'kissed', 'girls', 'made', 'cry', 'get', 'money', 'shop', 'girl', 'girl', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'micro-mini', 'peeking', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'sports', 'short', 'pony', 'skirt', 'boots', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'play', 'eldest', 'woman', 'Now', 'who', 'George', 'would', 'really', 'want', 'nice', 'sixties/seventies', 'Hollywood', 'decadence', 'screen', 'free', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'bogart', 'number', 'background', 'are', 'lot', 'mug', 'shots', 'Nixon', 'Agnew', 'juxtaposition', 'kind', 'joke', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1975', 'not', 'long', 'Watergate.Beatty', 'playing', 'role', 'said', 'be', 'patterned', 'makeup', 'artist', 'Jay', 'Sebring', 'competent', 'sympathy', 'maybe', 'know', 'never', 'going', 'amount', 'much', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'be', 'honest', 'thought', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'was', 'better', 'were', 'good', 'Actors', 'carried', 'Warden', 'Hawn', 'also', 'putting', 'strong', 'performances.Shampoo', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'funny', 'amusing', 'superior', 'sit-com', 'laugh', 'track', 'way', 'defining', 'Hollywood', 'film.See', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'royalty', 'brother', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'husband', 'Annette', 'Bening']",Shampoo VHS

Mind you, I don't think this is the case, for though I am a child of the 90s, I love other Hal Ashby films and several other movies that are considered seminal films of the 70s.  I'm also not one of those modern moviegoers who demands a lightning pace; I love films that have the confidence to take their time.  But all that said, I think that ""Shampoo"" is a very, very boring movie.  I sat there waiting and waiting for something to happen.  But more importantly, I kept waiting and waiting to LAUGH.  For a so-called comedy, ""Shampoo"" falls unbelievably flat.  The movie is as substantial as empty space - the entire time, I felt like I was watching air.  The movie does boast some good performances from Goldie Hawn, Julie Christie and especially Jack Warner, but their characters are just as dull as the rest of the movie, so it doesn't really matter anyway.  But Warren Beatty himself fares worst of all: his character is devoid of a personality, and his performance is equally as vapid.""Shampoo"" isn't a HORRIBLE film, so I can't quite bring myself to give it a single star rating.  If anything, the movie isn't substantial enough to hate; it just sits there, moving from scene to scene, having nothing to say and nothing with which to make you laugh.  You wan't good Hal Ashby?  Check out ""Harold & Maude,"" ""The Last Detail"" and ""Being There.""  For a good Warren Beatty/Julie Christie pairing, see ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller.""

385031,ABFJYHVD8RHLE,6303686834,Hillary,"[16, 19]","Yes it would if we could get Hollywood to produce films that are timelessly fresh as the great ""Shampoo"".Warren Beatty is unforgettable as George, a shameless womanizing cad of a hairdresser, who effortlessly beds every woman that crosses his path.  They usually do that at his salon, as they all wait for George to ""Do"" them, in more ways than one!George naturally has several girlfriends who he tries to keep from knowing about the others, but of course they all find out.  Goldie Hawn is just adorable here in her little velvet brown baby doll dress, and exudes a helpless little girl type charm from every pore.  She lives with George, when he's not with various others.  Lee Grant is his married lover, whose husband Jack Warden is the patsy.  He plays his role quite sympathetically.  There is Julie Christie as the girl who George really wants, and the only one who doesn't want him.  Now that IS realistic cinema.  There are other quickies of course.  A not to be missed young Carrie Fisher scores some real ""Love"" between tennis lessons before her mom gets ""done"" by George when she arrives home, and finds her daughter took her appointment! George goes about his day to day activities, without a hair out of place, no matter how often, or how many women try to seduce him.  A drunken Lee Grant creates a memorable scene when she visits George under a table they are seated at with several other people.  For more, YOU need to watch!What is interesting here, besides the wonderful flavor and mood of the late sixties captured in the music, free love attitudes, fashions and mod ambience, is that it took place in 1968 and was released in 1975.  It covers the election eve of 1968, the whole start of the Nixon era, released at the end of the  Watergate era.  Maybe that can be called dated now, but it gives you a real flavor of what the world of politics and attitudes were.  It is interesting and very unusual to see a film that is set in a time period, so close to the actual era that just preceded it.  There is less than a decade between the 1968 era theme,  and the films release in 1975.

385037,A30TK6U7DNS82R,6303686834,Kevin Killian,"[18, 18]","SHAMPOO harks back to the glory days of Hollywood to the famous incident at Ciro's (the night club) when Paulette Goddard added spice to her career by slipping under a table to give an evening's worth of excitement to director Anatole Litvak, thereby sealing her reputation as a party girl who really didn't care what anyone thought.  (In another version of the story, Goddard and Litvak both vanished under the table simultaneously and had sex on the nightclub floor on the feet of their friends.)  In any case, SHAMPOO recalls this incident by having Julie Christie slide out of her banquette to take care of the hairdresser, George Roundy (played by Warren Beatty) even though her ""boyfriend"" (Jack Warden) is hovering dangerously close by.SHAMPOO also takes its cues from British Restoration comedy like Wycherley and Congreve, a world of cuckolded gentlemen, odious bourgeoisie, discontented wives, and boys on the make, re-locating the center of the gilded universe from London to Los Angeles in the late 1960s.  As in Congreve, the husbands believe it's safe to leave their wives and daughters alone with George because he's a dandy/aesthete/hairdresser.  That suits him down to the ground, for on the bodies of these ignorant women he can have his revenge on the men who treat him as a tradesman, a social inferior.  The picture has a slightly dated air, as if to say, we're different now than when the action of this film is laid, which might be difficult to apprehend today.Beatty is fine, though his haircut doesn't recall the 1960s as much as the mid 70s when the film was produced.  As the typically 60s sex objects George dallies with, Julie Christie and Goldie Hawn are perfectly cast, almost too perfectly, they hardly seem to be acting at all; their haircuts and their clothes set the scene and call ""cut"" at the end of each take.  Kathryn Blondell, the insanely talented Hollywood hairdresser, did the real hair work here, at the beginning of a long career which has included just about every movie Goldie Hawn has done since (Kate Hudson too!), as well as such period pieces as APOLLO 13 and BIRD.  She is the master at making women look great on screen, and not just leading ladies, but supporting players and extras too.

The way these upscale, self-involved Los Angelenos of1968 partake of the free-love freedom of the 60s, but lose the associated political consciousness - completely ignoring Nixon's impending election -  is a valid an interesting observation (albeit one the film kind of beats to death).But the story of George, an uber-hip promiscuous hairdresser, and his assorted bedmates never quite feels like it has the depth it pretends to, nor is it as funny as it wants to be.Beatty is good playing a send up of his own image, but I felt so aware that he was doing exactly that, that it sort of took me out of the film.  He also makes George SO shallow, that while I could enjoy his adventures, and feel pity for the sadness underneath, I never could feel emotionally touched at how lost he really is.

Goldie Hawn is his girlfriend Jill, who is pushing him to open up his own shop.  He ends up soliciting start up funds from Lester played by Jack Warden who meets him on the behest of his wife Felicia play by Lee Grant.  George is sleeping with Felicia and as it turns out he used to date Lester's mistress, Jackie, played Julie Christie and also ends up sleeping with Lester's daughter Lorna played by Carrie Fisher in her first movie.

385043,A39IY0JU5JI69G,6303686834,"Promise ""promise""","[2, 2]","I always wonder, when I look at old films that I once liked a lot, whether they will hold up in time.  I really don't remember any strong my reaction to Shampoo, which I saw shortly after it came out.  I think I enjoyed it but dismissed it as kind of silly.Now I think I enjoyed it a lot more.  The script is very smart and manages to be both hilarious and serious.  The cast is stellar in every sense of the word:  Julie Christie and Goldie Hawn, both at the height of their physical beauty (although they have both aged remarkably well) are a sheer delight just to look at.  Warren is awesome, as always, despite the most ridiculous hairdo ever to be plopped on the head of a leading man. (With the possible exception of Sean Penn in Dead Man Walking.)  Lee Grant gives one of her  many sensational performances, Jack Gilbert takes what could have been a stock character and gives an added dimension to it, and Carrie Fisher shows her intelligence and presence in her first film appearance.Others here have likened the film to French sex farces and there is certainly an aspect of that, which gives us the hilarity.  It is so much more, though...a comment on the times, a perceptive picture of an obsessed Casanova (without dwelling too much on the psychological wierdness of it).  It's greatly entertaining, with the costumes, the parties and the many, many great scenes.  The scene with Warren and Julie in the bathroom, as he does her hair, is hot, hot, hot.  There were certainly sparks flying between them in those days.  It looked like they had all they could do to keep in character.  The scene where she disappears under the table in the restaurant is also hilarious.Yes, it's definitely a film of its time.  I recently saw Blow Up again, Antonioni's film which portrayed the London version of the same swinging 60's.  It captivated me the time it came out, but bored me now. But Shampoo, which was not as highly regarded as BlowUp strikes me as a film which will endure for a long time.  Warren Beatty is one of those people whose glamour and great looks hides the fact from many that he is one highly perception and intelligent person.  He knows how to make a smart social commentary that is also great fun.",5,Better with age,1218240000,"08 9, 2008",2008,2219,"['always', 'wonder', 'when', 'look', 'old', 'films', 'once', 'liked', 'lot', 'will', 'hold', 'up', 'time', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'strong', 'reaction', 'Shampoo', 'saw', 'shortly', 'came', 'out', 'think', 'enjoyed', 'dismissed', 'kind', 'silly.Now', 'think', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'more', 'script', 'very', 'smart', 'be', 'hilarious', 'serious', 'cast', 'stellar', 'sense', 'word', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'height', 'physical', 'beauty', 'have', 'aged', 'remarkably', 'well', 'are', 'sheer', 'delight', 'just', 'look', 'Warren', 'awesome', 'always', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'hairdo', 'ever', 'be', 'plopped', 'head', 'leading', 'man', 'possible', 'exception', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'one', 'many', 'sensational', 'performances', 'Jack', 'Gilbert', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stock', 'character', 'added', 'dimension', 'Carrie', 'Fisher', 'intelligence', 'presence', 'first', 'film', 'appearance.Others', 'here', 'have', 'likened', 'film', 'French', 'sex', 'farces', 'certainly', 'aspect', 'hilarity', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'comment', 'times', 'perceptive', 'picture', 'obsessed', 'Casanova', 'dwelling', 'too', 'much', 'psychological', 'wierdness', 'greatly', 'entertaining', 'costumes', 'parties', 'many', 'many', 'great', 'scenes', 'scene', 'Warren', 'Julie', 'bathroom', 'hair', 'hot', 'hot', 'hot', 'were', 'certainly', 'flying', 'days', 'looked', 'had', 'could', 'do', 'keep', 'character', 'scene', 'where', 'table', 'restaurant', 'also', 'hilarious.Yes', 'definitely', 'film', 'time', 'recently', 'saw', 'Blow', 'Up', 'again', 'Antonioni', 'film', 'portrayed', 'London', 'version', 'same', 'swinging', '60', 'captivated', 'time', 'came', 'out', 'bored', 'now', 'Shampoo', 'was', 'not', 'highly', 'regarded', 'BlowUp', 'film', 'will', 'endure', 'long', 'time', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'one', 'people', 'glamour', 'great', 'looks', 'fact', 'many', 'one', 'highly', 'perception', 'intelligent', 'person', 'how', 'make', 'smart', 'social', 'commentary', 'also', 'great', 'fun']",Shampoo VHS

385045,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6303686834,Randy Keehn,"[4, 12]","1975 was a good year for movies with the likes of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Jaws"", ""Dog Day Afternoon"", and, my favorite for the year, ""Dersu Uzala"".  There were a couple of popular movies that year that I never got around to seeing; ""Nashville"" and ""Shampoo"".  I finally got to see ""Shampoo"" the other night and, frankly, I was disappointed.  What disappointed me was the whole concept of the main character, George, played by Warren Beatty.  He was just too important in too many ways to too many people to come across as believable.  I wasn't surprized to see that, as co-writer, Beatty created his own character on that level.I still give the movie a decent rating because it is well-directed, well-acted, and moves along pretty well.  It was probably a bit on the edge in 1975 (for a major motion picture, that is) and still would be inappropriate for the younger ones.  I gather that it is a political commentary because so much of the background involves the Nixon/Agnew campaign in 1972.  I'm no big fan of either of those politicians but I came away thinking that they got the better of the script somehow.  I hope that the movie was also a comment on the sexual revolution of those days.  There was plenty of it with little emotion or purpose (other than the obvious).  Indeed, sex comes across as a loser to Richard and Spiro in the PR race.  George can't get enough of it and laments that he just can't pass up a pretty woman.  Then we are led to believe that he is actually emotionally involved with one of the many that he's physically involved with.  It's hard to tell which one that would be, however.  In the end he makes his choice but, by then, she seems as uninterested in that as we are.Lee Grant won the Best Supporting Oscar for her role as the wife of Jack Warden's character.  She was alright in her role but seems to have benefitted from a lack of competition.  The one who did stand out is Jack Warden.  He was excellent as a smooth operating money-managing, wife-cheating, where's-the-party sort of guy who always seems to be in control (or, at least enough in control as anyone seems to be in this movie).  His competition for the Oscar that year, however, was George Burns in his memorable role in ""The Sunshine Boys"".I like a good satire but I didn't see one in ""Shampoo"".  I guess thirty years of waiting left me underwhelmed.  I hope I get a better reaction to ""Nashville"" when I finally get to see that one.",4,Sham Plot,1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,2451,"['1975', 'was', 'good', 'year', 'movies', 'likes', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'Jaws', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'favorite', 'year', 'Dersu', 'Uzala', 'were', 'couple', 'popular', 'movies', 'year', 'never', 'got', 'seeing', 'Nashville', 'Shampoo', 'finally', 'got', 'see', 'Shampoo', 'other', 'night', 'frankly', 'was', 'disappointed', 'What', 'disappointed', 'was', 'whole', 'concept', 'main', 'character', 'George', 'played', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'important', 'too', 'many', 'ways', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'come', 'believable', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprized', 'see', 'that', 'co-writer', 'Beatty', 'created', 'own', 'character', 'level.I', 'still', 'give', 'movie', 'decent', 'rating', 'well-directed', 'well-acted', 'moves', 'pretty', 'well', 'was', 'probably', 'bit', 'edge', '1975', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'still', 'would', 'be', 'inappropriate', 'younger', 'ones', 'gather', 'political', 'commentary', 'so', 'much', 'background', 'Nixon/Agnew', 'campaign', '1972', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'politicians', 'came', 'away', 'thinking', 'got', 'better', 'script', 'somehow', 'hope', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'comment', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'days', 'was', 'plenty', 'little', 'emotion', 'purpose', 'other', 'obvious', 'Indeed', 'sex', 'across', 'loser', 'Richard', 'Spiro', 'PR', 'race', 'George', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'pretty', 'woman', 'Then', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'actually', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'one', 'many', 'physically', 'involved', 'hard', 'tell', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'however', 'end', 'choice', 'then', 'as', 'uninterested', 'are.Lee', 'Grant', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Oscar', 'role', 'wife', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'character', 'was', 'alright', 'role', 'have', 'benefitted', 'lack', 'competition', 'one', 'who', 'did', 'stand', 'out', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'was', 'excellent', 'smooth', 'operating', 'money-managing', 'wife-cheating', ""where's-the-party"", 'sort', 'guy', 'who', 'always', 'be', 'control', 'least', 'enough', 'control', 'anyone', 'be', 'movie', 'competition', 'Oscar', 'year', 'however', 'was', 'George', 'Burns', 'memorable', 'role', 'Sunshine', 'Boys', '.I', 'good', 'satire', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'Shampoo', 'guess', 'thirty', 'years', 'waiting', 'left', 'underwhelmed', 'hope', 'get', 'better', 'reaction', 'Nashville', 'when', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'one']",Shampoo VHS
