1022585,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B000IZJQU2,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[4, 12]","I hate to use the word CHEESY, but I have to! The premise of this movie from India is in metaphor. Baghban means Caretaker, one who nutures garden. Or, a caretaker loves a tree with a shadow because the shade of the tree will provide. The belief is that if you devote your life to your children, in return, you will be guaranteed comfort.The movie is based on a metaphor, fantasy, reality and sprinkled with lengthy dance musical numbers that only Bollywood provides.  Baghban, at three hours long focuses on Raj who has had nearly a perfect life, retiring from a bank job, married for 40 years to a beautiful loving wife, and he raised five beautiful sons. He gave all to his sons, including caring love and kindness. At retirement, there is no money, and he believes that his sons will take him and his wife into their homes, lovingly..... Wrong.PlotMarried for 40 years and retired, Raj and Pooja are forced to live separately as their sons reluctantly take them, rotating and separating the parents.  In separate homes and ""in the way"" they become a disruption to the family. Alas, the ""orphan turned adopted good son"" arrives.Cheesy unoriginal scenesYou will have to see these to believe how blatantly cheesy they are. What I would expect from a good director is to convey to me, the viewer, scenes that allow me to think on my own, even if just for a while. The director was quick to shove these numerous exaggerated scenarios in our face. This is insulting.Unanswered Question???If a man and wife raised four children with strong emotional loving, caring bonds, to lead successful lives, how could all four sons possibly be as inconsiderate and cold as they were? The two elements don't jive!!Use of English language, Pepsi and Ford Surprisingly,English phrases are used throughout and Pepsi and Ford take their spot prominently.If you want a true family relationship movie that rings similar to this, try director Ozu's 50'sTokyo Story - Criterion Collection.

After reading prior reviews of this movie, I knew that I wanted to not only see but own this film.  It's three hours long, which means I won't be watching it over and over ( I do have a life) but I will watch it again.  It's about selfishness and examines what happens when the children you've raised and loved, don't love you back. Baghad explores the Hindi family circle and takes a look at the flip side - the ugly side. It's not about one bad seed...it's about when all your children "" leave the farm"" and consider their parents a burden.  I've watched enough Hindi films to know this is not the way things are supposed to be. The two lead actors, (Raj) Amitabh Bachchan and ( Poojah) Hema Malini were outstanding, perfectly matched. Salman Khan( in cameo role ) as the adopted, but most grateful child was a marked contrast to the rest of his siblings. He was so low key he was almost pious complete with halo ! As a avid SK fan, I was initially put off ( yes I was looking for the over the top - but the more I watched the movie, the more I came to understand the how of his character.  The rest of the cast played their parts well - well enough for me to cheer at the end when Raj and Poojah did not forgive them for the way they treated them.  I don't think any parent would.  The music was delightful and and made nice connections with the scenes..but I didn't find a billboard hit among them.  The clothing was very well done.

1022592,A14A4YYKPLYY26,B000IZJQU2,LactivistAnti-VaccineLiberal,"[0, 0]","Baghban (which means ""Gardener"" and/or ""Caretaker"" in Hindi) is a 2003 Bollywood musical drama based on an unofficial adaptation of the 1937 movie, ""Make Way for Tomorrow"", and is directed by Ravi Chopra. It features veteran Bollywood greats Amitabh Bachchan & Hema Malini in the starring roles. Salman Khan, Mahima Chaudhry, Lilette Dubey, Paresh Rawal & others are featured in supporting roles.Baghban is a beautiful movie that tells the story of an aging couple, Raj Malhotra (Amitabh Bachchan) and his wife Pooja (Hema Malini) who have just celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary, and are just as much in love as ever.Together, Raj and Pooja have four sons -- Ajay (Aman Verma), Sanjay (Samir Soni), Rohit (Saahil Chadda), and Karan (Nasir Khan) and just like the title (of ""Caretaker"" and/or ""Gardener"") indicates and is especially common in Indian culture, Raj & Pooja have spent their lives working and sacrificing to nurture their ""crop"" (their children).Just like was expressed in the opening narration theme of the movie: ""Baghban....the one that tends to his garden, and a father who starts a family.......... both sweat and toil to make their roses and wards thrive. The gardener loves not just the trees in his garden, he loves their shadow too. For he hopes that one day, when he's tired of life, It is this very shade that will prove useful for him"", Raj is confident that his four sons will be his & Pooja's ""shade"" in their golden years.Although Raj has a very successful & good-paying job, nearly everything he's earned over his lifetime of working, he spent on his sons.  Even when the sons are old enough to take on some or all of the responsibility themselves, Raj & Pooja still sacrifice to help them. For example in one scene, the 2nd eldest son, Sanjay, a grown man (with, if I'm not mistaken, a 5 or 6 year old son of his own!) asks his parents for 50,000 Rupees (Google the current exchange rate if you want to know how much that is, in dollars) for the down payment for a new car. So without any hesitation or thought for himself or his future, Raj immediately withdraws the 50,000 -- the last little bit of money in his retirement account, and he & Pooja give it to their son, believing its their duty as parents and being confident that their generosity to their sons will one day be reciprocated.So when Raj retires, he has no real retirement ""nest egg"" to speak of, because he has spent his entire career borrowing against his pension and spending the money in his retirement account to finance his children's expenses & worse, even their luxuries (like the 50,000 Rupees he gave Sanjay for the down payment on a new car). However, he is not worried. Even when he discovers that he and Pooja can no longer even afford to continue living in their own home, he is still not concerned. He believes strongly that HIS ""nest egg"" is his 4 sons, who will finally repay all the sacrifices that he and Pooja have made for them over the years, by taking them in and caring for them in their old age.Unfortunately Raj is sorely mistaken & has immensely overestimated the generosity (or lack thereof!) of his sons!Despite having spent nearly everything they earned, and sacrificing their retirement nest egg, helping out their sons (to buy cars, homes and other things) when those same sons learn of their parents predicament they have no desire to reciprocate the generosity. Not a single one is willing to take in their parents -- for various reasons all of them feeling that it's too much of a hassle and burden.So instead they ""compromise"" with the most cruel of ""solutions"" -- they decide to split up their parents after 40 years of happy marriage (four decades of rarely, if ever, being apart) by having each parent live separately with one of the sons & his family for 6 months before rotating & going to another son's home for 6 months!The four sons make this proposal thinking that their parents will refuse the offer, refusing to be separated and they will then find a way to remain in their home anyway. Devastated by their sons callous insensitivity & and at the thought of being separated from each other, but yet backed into a corner with no other options, the now suddenly poverty-stricken Raj & Pooja reluctantly accept their sons proposal.This movie shows how these aging/aged parents endure this heartbreaking separation as well as the horrible treatment from their sons and daughters-in-law after all they have sacrificed for them during their lifetime.I don't want to give away what happens (if you are planning to watch this movie and don't want ""spoilers"" I suggest you stay away from Wikipedia!) so all I am going to say is that this is beautiful and poignant movie about the bonds of family, including the responsibilities that go with it.What does it mean to be a part of a family? And like the tagline for this movie states: ""Can you depend on your family??""Baghban is a WONDERFUL film that I strongly encourage everyone (especially those with children and/or aging parents) to see! In my opinion, the casting & acting is superb! Amitabh Bachchan & Hema Malini, who have been prized Bollywood stars since the 1960s or 70s, really shine as the happily married (and passionately in love) couple who are heartbroken after being cruelly torn apart by their selfish and greedy sons. The four sons played by Aman Verma, Samir Soni, Saahil Chadda, and Nasir Khan also portray their roles as the ""villains"" (so to speak!) wonderfully!Of course, this is a Bollywood musical with the requisite cheesy song and dance numbers, but the storyline is so touching that, as far as I'm concerned, it  makes it worth it!!BEAUTIFUL MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,"Touching Bollywood Movie About

1022594,A2PVZJY7E6454H,B000IZJQU2,"Lyn ""Lyn""","[9, 10]","Baghban (The Caretaker )is about an older couple (Amitabh Bachchan & Hema Malini) who have remained in love and devoted to each other, and have lived their marriage focused on their 4 natural sons and one adopted son (Salman Khan). They are good people who are loved by their friends but their geneority to their children means they retire with no money. They ask their sons that they live with them. All 4 natural sons and their wives resist this as it messed with their established lives. They offer a plan that Mum and Dad be split up and that each takes turns at putting one up. They aren't very generous with the parent they do have and treat them badly. Meanwhile Dad has befriended the childless owner of a local caf&eacute;/bookstore (Paresh Rawal)  and his wife (Lillete Dubey) and they encourage him to write his story. Eventually adopted son and new wife rescue the pair and friends have arranged the publishing of the father's writings.While it was a little slow in parts (and quite long) I became quite involved in this one. It is well acted -though Salman Khan was trying to play himself down as humble so much he was almost unnecessarily low key at times. The sons and wives were a bit stereotyped too. However this movie had some very thoughtful and poetic passages on love and relationships, and I found myself quite moved and drawn into it.Frequenters of Bollywood are familiar with various plays on intergenerational relationships. We have seen amazing happy intergenerational families under the same roof; egotistical controlling parents dictating to their kids how to live with no real care for the child; and this sort - good parents with self-focused kids. This one was a bit deeper than usual and did leave me thinking of the balance between togetherness and freedom between generations that the West has taken into the free/ disconnected end (often as a reaction to experiences of control, blindness and suffocation from the opposite experience in earlier centuries).It was also an exploring of a deep long-lasting marital relationship and how love can be when people are considerate and tuned in. I wouldn't have given it the ending they did but others may disagree with me on that.Amitabh, Hema, Paresh & Lillete are especially good and the screenplay rich. The music was fine but mostly I can't recall much of it. The fact it brought me to tears at times (usually in a good way!) I always rate highly.

This movie brings to light the sacrifice that parents make for their children and how little of their love do most of us return. Though the movie does start off a bit happy-go-lucky, stay tuned because 30-45 min into it things get deadly serious and though there is no gore or violence there are countless moments that are too painful and heartbreaking to watch. This movie IMO is not overdone or melodramatic but quite realistic. VERY family friendly so dont be afraid to have your children join in.

The movie is long like 3 hours but you get lost in the story. It is such a wonderful family movie and so refreshing, non violent and clean something almost impossible to find anymore even in a cartoon! It is very impressive to find something truly entertaining and a great story line. It is romantic, the scenes that show dancing are fabulous. I love the couple in this movie. A lot about the movie is realistic. I think it was definlety written from an older persons perspective but it is great to see it made me call my mom just to say i love you after seeing it. Its a reminder of how much we should respect and cherish our parents. No matter the mistakes they made we should remember the good and treat them with the dignity we hope to be treated with when we are their age.
