1625641,A13VBXAMKNK95X,B00BCPOEIG,Kerick Howlett,"[12, 12]","&#34;My Bride is a Mermaid&#34; is an adaptation of a Manga series originally serialized in a Square-Enix magazine in Japan. How the plot goes is that a young 14-year-old boy by the name of Nagasumi is on vacation visiting his grandmother's at the Seto Inland Sea, and while he is swimming out in the sea, he starts to drown (for unknown reasons), and is later saved by a mermaid by the name of San Seto. Turns out that San Seto is not your &#34;typical&#34; mermaid as she is the daughter of the head boss of a Yakuhza crime family, and due to the Mermaid Code, since Nagasumi saw San in her mermaid form, one of them must be killed. Now there is a loophole to this by simply allowing Nagasumi to marry into the family, thus saving both their lives.This is a &#34;Harem Anime&#34; genre where our main hero earns the affections of several young women, such as: Mawari, the Superintendent General's daughter and childhood friend of Nagasumi; Lunar, another fellow mermaid that happens to be a national pop star as well as daughter of the head of the Edomae Crime Family; and Class Rep, a &#34;mousy-glasses&#34; that is the class rep for Nagasumi's classroom that wishes for people to call her by her true name.Of course there are also an extended cast of hilarious characters that helps make this show great, such as: Chimp, the pervy best-friend of Nagasumi but has an alternative identity as &#34;Chimp Roshi&#34;, a wise hermit in the ways of womanizing; Masa, Afro wearing lieutenant of the Seto gang that is unbelievably cool and smooth and can immediately attract the lustful affections of just about anyone including Nagasumi and his married mom; Maki, a foot tall, two-faced assassin for the Seto gang and personal bodyguard of San; Edomae, Lunar's father and head of the Edomae gang, he is hilarious all on his own as he is based off the Terminator and just Arnold Schwarzenegger in general; and there are just so many more memorable characters that makes this show great!This show is definitely worth the watch due to its hilarious and memorable characters that keep getting into situations that will keep you laughing from start to finish of the entire 26-episode series! It has both Japanese Sub and English Dub, but despite it being dubbed by FUNimation, the voice acting is surprisingly well done, and just like any voice acting should be, there voices help further define their characters. It has all the over-the-top moments as typical Anime does, and comedy that is so ingeniously written that you will have to pause it just so you can finish laughing and not miss a thing. Normally I would suggest to people to watch an anime before you buy, but I undoubtedly know that you will just fall in love with this show and keep watching it again and again! I especially recommend it since its at a very cheap and affordable price!",5,Hilarious!,1378252800,"09 4, 2013",2013,2842,"['34', 'Bride', 'Mermaid', '34', 'adaptation', 'Manga', 'series', 'originally', 'serialized', 'Square-Enix', 'magazine', 'Japan', 'How', 'plot', 'young', '14-year-old', 'boy', 'name', 'Nagasumi', 'vacation', 'visiting', 'grandmother', 'Seto', 'Inland', 'Sea', 'swimming', 'out', 'sea', 'drown', 'unknown', 'reasons', 'later', 'saved', 'mermaid', 'name', 'San', 'Seto', 'out', 'San', 'Seto', 'not', '34', 'typical', '34', 'mermaid', 'daughter', 'head', 'boss', 'Yakuhza', 'crime', 'family', 'due', 'Mermaid', 'Code', 'Nagasumi', 'saw', 'San', 'mermaid', 'form', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'killed', 'Now', 'loophole', 'simply', 'allowing', 'Nagasumi', 'marry', 'family', 'thus', 'saving', 'lives.This', '34', 'Harem', 'Anime', '34', 'genre', 'where', 'main', 'hero', 'affections', 'several', 'young', 'women', 'such', 'Mawari', 'Superintendent', 'General', 'daughter', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Nagasumi', 'Lunar', 'fellow', 'mermaid', 'be', 'national', 'pop', 'star', 'as', 'well', 'daughter', 'head', 'Edomae', 'Crime', 'Family', 'Class', 'Rep', '34', 'mousy-glasses', '34', 'class', 'rep', 'Nagasumi', 'classroom', 'people', 'call', 'true', 'name.Of', 'course', 'are', 'also', 'extended', 'cast', 'hilarious', 'characters', 'helps', 'make', 'show', 'great', 'such', 'Chimp', 'pervy', 'best-friend', 'Nagasumi', 'alternative', 'identity', '34', 'Chimp', 'Roshi', '34', 'wise', 'hermit', 'ways', 'womanizing', 'Masa', 'Afro', 'wearing', 'lieutenant', 'Seto', 'gang', 'unbelievably', 'cool', 'smooth', 'can', 'immediately', 'attract', 'lustful', 'affections', 'just', 'anyone', 'including', 'Nagasumi', 'married', 'mom', 'Maki', 'foot', 'tall', 'two-faced', 'assassin', 'Seto', 'gang', 'personal', 'bodyguard', 'San', 'Edomae', 'Lunar', 'father', 'head', 'Edomae', 'gang', 'hilarious', 'own', 'based', 'off', 'Terminator', 'just', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'general', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'memorable', 'characters', 'show', 'great', 'show', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watch', 'due', 'hilarious', 'memorable', 'characters', 'keep', 'getting', 'situations', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing', 'start', 'finish', 'entire', '26-episode', 'series', 'both', 'Japanese', 'Sub', 'English', 'Dub', 'being', 'dubbed', 'FUNimation', 'voice', 'acting', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'done', 'just', 'voice', 'acting', 'should', 'be', 'voices', 'help', 'further', 'define', 'characters', 'over-the-top', 'moments', 'typical', 'Anime', 'comedy', 'so', 'ingeniously', 'written', 'will', 'have', 'pause', 'just', 'can', 'finish', 'laughing', 'not', 'miss', 'thing', 'Normally', 'would', 'suggest', 'people', 'watch', 'anime', 'buy', 'undoubtedly', 'know', 'will', 'just', 'fall', 'love', 'show', 'keep', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'especially', 'recommend', 'very', 'cheap', 'affordable', 'price']",My Bride is a Mermaid: Complete S.A.V.E.
