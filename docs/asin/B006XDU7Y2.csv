The inclusion of a soundtrack CD with the blu-ray discs was also most welcome.Set in the near future, the basis of the story is pretty standard fare; one guy in an academy full of girls! Add the inevitable childhood sweethearts, girls with guns (or in this case, mecha suits called IS's; the 'Infinite Stratos' of the title) and comic mayhem is a dead cert! Jealousy, tantrums, broken hearts, embarrassing moments involving underwear or swimsuits, and pretty much all aspects of 'anime' life are represented here. The animation and music tracks are stunning; the aerial 'dog-fight' sequences are brilliantly executed, and the technology of the IS's is cool and believable. There is lots of cuteness, and some heart-stopping moments.The male lead is Ichika Orimura, a 15-year-old boy who is found to be the only male in the world who can pilot an IS. Needless to say, the other pilots, who are all girls, are not happy about this to begin with, but some of them soon fall for him. Just to make matters interesting, it turns out that his older sister Chifuyu is their home-room teacher, and she takes no prisoners!Throw into the mix former childhood friend Houki Shinonono, who is initially billeted in the same apartment with him. She is not amused about this, and undressing for bed, and the taking of showers, all lead to the inevitable blushes and embarrassment! Initially, she has no IS of her own, and has to make use of a generic 'training' IS provided by the academy, but is later given a new 4th generation model called 'Akatsubaki' by her big sister Tabane, who just happens to be the inventor and designer of the IS concept!Next is Cecilia Alcott, the English IS Cadet Representative and pilot of IS 'Blue Tears', who also falls for Ichika, as she comes to consider him a strong and worthy opponent.Then there is Rin Fan, the Chinese IS Cadet Representative, who turns out to be another of Ichika's childhood friends; her IS is called Shenlong, and she is hacked off at Ichika for forgetting a promise he made to her in childhood, but she forgives him eventually.Laura Bodewig is the German IS Cadet Representative; her IS is called 'Schwarzer Regen' (the German for Black Rain), and is notable for the massive long-range sniper rifle, and rail-gun, it carries. She is not a very 'girly' girl, and following an incident with a bikini, she is overjoyed when Ichika tells her she looks cute in it! For the remainder of that episode, she goes around all starry-eyed, repeating 'He said I voz cute!' when anyone speaks to her!Last of the girls is Charlotte Dunois, from France, who is the pilot of the Rafale-Revive Custom II IS; she initially joins the academy posing as a boy called Charles, and is billeted with Ichika, but he soon rumbles that she is a girl, after a number of embarrassing incidents involving underclothes and bathing!The story is cute, fun, heartwarming and lovable, and there are some great IS fight sequences, but ultimately it is the relationships betwen Ichika and the girls that provide the most enjoyable aspect of the series; I totally loved it!There is a little fan-service, mostly to do with bikinis and the tight-fitting 'undersuits' they all wear when piloting their IS's, with the occasional shower or bathing related scenes providing the rest, but it is certainly not 'fan-service' heavy. I won't reveal the ending, except to say it was very cute, and provoked the inevitable 'Awww!' response!Also look out for the cute and amusing incident with Houki and Ichika involving a bikini, a night-time meeting on the beach, a (nearly!) first kiss, four other jealous girls and a sword!Excellent; I hope there will be more in this series!",5,Don't miss this!,1338076800,"05 27, 2012",2012,3791,"['pre-ordered', 'as', 'soon', 'Amazon', 'listed', 'came', 'recently', 'watched', 'over', 'three', 'nights', 'was', 'great', 'inclusion', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'blu-ray', 'discs', 'was', 'also', 'most', 'welcome.Set', 'near', 'future', 'basis', 'story', 'pretty', 'standard', 'fare', 'one', 'guy', 'academy', 'full', 'girls', 'Add', 'inevitable', 'childhood', 'sweethearts', 'girls', 'guns', 'case', 'mecha', 'suits', 'called', 'IS', ""'Infinite"", 'Stratos', 'title', 'comic', 'mayhem', 'dead', 'cert', 'Jealousy', 'tantrums', 'broken', 'hearts', 'embarrassing', 'moments', 'involving', 'underwear', 'swimsuits', 'pretty', 'much', 'aspects', ""'anime"", 'life', 'are', 'represented', 'here', 'animation', 'music', 'tracks', 'are', 'stunning', 'aerial', ""'dog-fight"", 'sequences', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'executed', 'technology', 'IS', 'cool', 'believable', 'lots', 'cuteness', 'heart-stopping', 'moments.The', 'male', 'lead', 'Ichika', 'Orimura', '15-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'found', 'be', 'only', 'male', 'world', 'who', 'can', 'pilot', 'IS', 'Needless', 'say', 'other', 'pilots', 'who', 'are', 'girls', 'are', 'not', 'happy', 'begin', 'soon', 'fall', 'Just', 'make', 'matters', 'interesting', 'out', 'older', 'sister', 'Chifuyu', 'home-room', 'teacher', 'prisoners', 'Throw', 'mix', 'former', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Houki', 'Shinonono', 'who', 'initially', 'billeted', 'same', 'apartment', 'not', 'amused', 'undressing', 'bed', 'taking', 'showers', 'lead', 'inevitable', 'blushes', 'embarrassment', 'Initially', 'IS', 'own', 'make', 'use', 'generic', ""'training"", 'IS', 'provided', 'academy', 'later', 'given', 'new', '4th', 'generation', 'model', 'called', ""'Akatsubaki"", 'big', 'sister', 'Tabane', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'inventor', 'designer', 'IS', 'concept', 'Next', 'Cecilia', 'Alcott', 'English', 'IS', 'Cadet', 'Representative', 'pilot', 'IS', ""'Blue"", 'Tears', 'who', 'also', 'Ichika', 'consider', 'strong', 'worthy', 'opponent.Then', 'Rin', 'Fan', 'Chinese', 'IS', 'Cadet', 'Representative', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'Ichika', 'childhood', 'friends', 'IS', 'called', 'Shenlong', 'hacked', 'off', 'Ichika', 'forgetting', 'promise', 'made', 'childhood', 'eventually.Laura', 'Bodewig', 'German', 'IS', 'Cadet', 'Representative', 'IS', 'called', 'Regen', 'German', 'Black', 'Rain', 'notable', 'massive', 'long-range', 'sniper', 'rifle', 'rail-gun', 'not', 'very', ""'girly"", 'girl', 'following', 'incident', 'bikini', 'overjoyed', 'when', 'Ichika', 'cute', 'remainder', 'episode', 'starry-eyed', 'repeating', ""'He"", 'said', 'voz', 'cute', 'when', 'anyone', 'Last', 'girls', 'Charlotte', 'Dunois', 'France', 'who', 'pilot', 'Rafale-Revive', 'Custom', 'II', 'IS', 'initially', 'academy', 'posing', 'boy', 'called', 'Charles', 'billeted', 'Ichika', 'soon', 'girl', 'number', 'embarrassing', 'incidents', 'involving', 'underclothes', 'bathing', 'story', 'cute', 'fun', 'heartwarming', 'lovable', 'are', 'great', 'IS', 'fight', 'sequences', 'ultimately', 'relationships', 'betwen', 'Ichika', 'girls', 'provide', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'aspect', 'series', 'totally', 'loved', 'little', 'fan-service', 'mostly', 'do', 'bikinis', 'tight-fitting', ""'undersuits"", 'wear', 'when', 'piloting', 'IS', 'occasional', 'shower', 'bathing', 'related', 'scenes', 'providing', 'rest', 'certainly', 'not', ""'fan-service"", 'heavy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'ending', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'cute', 'provoked', 'inevitable', ""'Awww"", 'response', 'Also', 'look', 'out', 'cute', 'amusing', 'incident', 'Houki', 'Ichika', 'involving', 'bikini', 'night-time', 'meeting', 'beach', 'nearly', 'first', 'kiss', 'four', 'other', 'jealous', 'girls', 'sword', 'Excellent', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'series']",Infinite Stratos: Complete Collection

The aerial battles were rather astonishing given the limitations of the series (no Gundam-type space battles).  The series as a whole offers some of the funniest one-liners I have heard in a long time, and the overall level of ""funny"" was very high.What made this memorable for me, though, was how the music coincided with the action in such a fluid manner that I could not imagine watching it without.  To illustrate my point, the series opens with a scene from the last IS battle set to different music than the actual final battle.  The change in music offered such a dramatic difference (literaly, not figuratively) that it truly ""completed"" the scene.  During the final battle, I thought the music fit so perfectly with the animation that I immediately thought of both ""Gladiator"" and ""Transformers"" as a comparison.My knock on the series is character development.  Even though they did the best job possible given 12 episodes, I would have liked to see just a little more...and slightly less cluelessness from Ichika.

The voice work is good, but not great.
