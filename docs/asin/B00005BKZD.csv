However, it only goes to show how little we really know about the people around us.  Or if we make assumptions, how terribly wrong we would be.VIGNETTES OF MANY LIVES AND A MOMENT IN TIME IN EACH:You see the successful doctor in her loneliness, the whimsical card reader that is right on in her readings, while barely carrying on in her horribly tragic relationship.  You see the blind woman and her sister, weaving their own makebelieve worlds around each other.  The hard driving single woman in an impossible relationship, only reaching for even more impossible situations to comfort her.ONE CAUTION:These stories are all somewhat depressing.How many times can we see how easy another's life seems on the surface, when we feel ours are so much more complicated and tragic.

581567,A2MZXLN9TLP1R4,B00005BKZD,GLBT,"[11, 30]","""Things You Can Tell..."" is a series of short stories that tangentially relate to one another. All are about attractive, white, affluent women who are sad and lonely. That's one of the big problems with this movie is that there's no real diversity. You can tell that the ""dramatic monologues"" that are given throughout the movie were all written by the same person, even though they're spoken by different characters. All of the sad, lonely, white, well-educated, affluent women have the same basic personality, but with mild idiosyncracies (this one sleeps around a lot, this one is shy, this one is blind).In format, this film is similar to Robert Altman's ""Short Cuts"" or the more recent ""Magnolia"" but one reason that those movies succeed where this one fails is because in THOSE movies, the people and the stories are so incredibly diverse and yet they all feel authentic. This movie lacks both qualities.In place of depth and solid characterization, ""Things You Can Tell..."" relies upon cheap melodrama (lots and lots of crying, let me tell you...) and really contrived moments where one woman is giving her speech about being lonely and the music is playing and another woman is staring intently at her, eyes wide, as if this is the most precious moment ever lived.And the music... blah. Very distracting. Very intrusive.I admired what this movie was trying to do and there were some good performances, but the script lacked any real depth and the inclusion of a dwarf and two blind people did not compensate for the fact that almost every single female character in this movie was essentially the same and that all of them (with the one exception of the woman whose lover was dying) were looking for ""true love"" and that was the main focus of their stories.Overall, a very disappointing movie.",2,Mediocre Drama - could have been so much more...,1047168000,"03 9, 2003",2003,1801,"['Things', 'Can', 'Tell', 'series', 'short', 'stories', 'tangentially', 'relate', 'one', 'are', 'attractive', 'white', 'affluent', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'sad', 'lonely', 'one', 'big', 'problems', 'movie', 'real', 'diversity', 'can', 'tell', 'dramatic', 'monologues', 'are', 'given', 'movie', 'were', 'written', 'same', 'person', 'even', ""'re"", 'spoken', 'different', 'characters', 'sad', 'lonely', 'white', 'well-educated', 'affluent', 'women', 'have', 'same', 'basic', 'personality', 'mild', 'idiosyncracies', 'one', 'sleeps', 'lot', 'one', 'shy', 'one', 'blind', '.In', 'format', 'film', 'similar', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'more', 'recent', 'Magnolia', 'one', 'reason', 'movies', 'succeed', 'where', 'one', 'fails', 'THOSE', 'movies', 'people', 'stories', 'are', 'so', 'incredibly', 'diverse', 'yet', 'feel', 'authentic', 'movie', 'qualities.In', 'place', 'depth', 'solid', 'characterization', 'Can', 'Tell', 'cheap', 'melodrama', 'lots', 'lots', 'crying', 'let', 'tell', 'really', 'contrived', 'moments', 'where', 'one', 'woman', 'giving', 'speech', 'being', 'lonely', 'music', 'playing', 'woman', 'staring', 'intently', 'eyes', 'wide', 'most', 'precious', 'moment', 'ever', 'music', 'blah', 'Very', 'distracting', 'Very', 'intrusive.I', 'admired', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'there', 'were', 'good', 'performances', 'script', 'lacked', 'real', 'depth', 'inclusion', 'dwarf', 'two', 'blind', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'compensate', 'fact', 'almost', 'single', 'female', 'character', 'movie', 'was', 'essentially', 'same', 'one', 'exception', 'woman', 'lover', 'was', 'dying', 'were', 'looking', 'true', 'love', 'was', 'main', 'focus', 'stories.Overall', 'very', 'disappointing', 'movie']",Things You Can Tell Just By Looking at Her VHS

The emotional troubles of women, the shallow men who flirt and dump, the oppresive this, the glass-ceiling that. Well, did I get a surprise. My male, againg, Christian soul received a bit of a shake.This film is indeed about women who've made some bad choices. And are in the process of realizing it. Some do better after this realization, some, apparently, do not. Much like real life. Those wake up calls often get the snooze for many years. We allow ourselves to be fooled because we need the affection, the praise, the prestige, or the glory. And find ourselves feeling used, ignored, or humiliated. But far too often the way we cleanse that soiled feeling is to do the same over again. Ask the domestic violence counselor who's seen the same woman in multiple abusive relationships. She knows better. He knows she knows better. Yet the alarm is turned off repeatedly.There are many small jewels in this film. To reveal too much would spoil a carefully crafted tale. But this is a film intelligently at odds with the lifestyle portrayed in most cinema, where ""I am the most important person"" and ""I need to follow my heart"" and ""I need to be funny and cool and hip and ironic and cynical.""

The film is filled with wonderful performances most noteably by Calista Flockhart as a gay fortune teller dealing with her dying lover. Valeria Golina is equally effective as the lover. This is by the far the best vignette out of the 6. Cameron Diaz also gives a wonderful performance as a blind woman living with her lonely sister played with sincerity by Amy Brennaman.

581570,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00005BKZD,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 5]","""Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her"" is a movie written and directed by Rodrigo Garcia, who wrote and directed what I think was the 3rd best film of 2005 ""Nine Lives."" This film features much of the cast of that film. This movie is Garcia's first movie and it's apparent, it definitely has a first movie vibe to it. Unlike, ""Nine Lives"" which let us eavesdrop on 15 minutes in the life of a woman and never leading us back to that woman; This film gives us vignettes (that are much longer than 15 minutes) and at the end brings us back to see what became of the women. While each vignette is an affecting and smart one, Garcia was able to show more emotion in the 15 minutes than he was in these 30 minute or so ones. Like, ""Nine Lives"" all of the vignettes are separated into sections. The first one is:1. ""This is Dr. Keener"": We meet a woman named Dr. Keener (Glenn Close) who is taking care of an elderly woman. A fortune teller (Calista Flockhart) arrives at her house and predicts her future.2. ""Fantasies About Rebecca"": Rebecca (Holly Hunter) discovers that she's pregnant; Meanwhile, she has sex with a co-worker (Matt Craven) and chats with a homeless woman.3. ""Someone for Rose"": A children's book writer named Rose (Kathy Baker) watches as a dwarf named Albert (Danny Wood) moves in across the street; as her son Jay makes a shocking revelation.4. ""Good Night Lilly, Good Night Christine"": The most affecting of the vignettes, is the story returning the fortune teller Christine (Flockhart) who watches as her lover Lilly (Valeria Golino) dies.5. ""Love Waits for Kathy"": A detective named Kathy (Amy Brenneman) deals with loneliness, while her blind sister Carol (Cameron Diaz) bonds with a man named Walter (Matt Craven).In a nutshell, there's the synopsis. While all the vignettes are affecting, I think the most entertaining one is ""Someone for Rose""; While, as I said, the most affecting is ""Good Night Lilly, Good Night Christine."" Holly Hunter delivers the best performance in the movie, while Glenn Close is completely understated and Cameron Diaz delivers one of her best performances. The biggest problem with the movie, although it has very few flaws, is that some of the vignettes drag on too long, but it's not Garcia's fault...It's his first movie. He does a show an amazing talent for going into a woman's life for a few moments and making something out of it. This is a good film, it's not a great film but it's definitely worth checking out.GRADE: B+",4,"Feels like a Prequel to ""Nine Lives""",1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,2486,"['Things', 'Can', 'Tell', 'Just', 'Looking', 'Her', 'movie', 'written', 'directed', 'Rodrigo', 'Garcia', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'what', 'think', 'was', '3rd', 'best', 'film', '2005', 'Nine', 'film', 'much', 'cast', 'film', 'movie', 'Garcia', 'first', 'movie', 'apparent', 'definitely', 'first', 'movie', 'vibe', 'Nine', 'Lives', 'let', 'eavesdrop', '15', 'minutes', 'life', 'woman', 'never', 'leading', 'back', 'woman', 'film', 'vignettes', 'are', 'much', 'longer', '15', 'minutes', 'end', 'back', 'see', 'what', 'became', 'women', 'vignette', 'affecting', 'smart', 'one', 'Garcia', 'was', 'able', 'show', 'more', 'emotion', '15', 'minutes', 'was', '30', 'minute', 'so', 'ones', 'Nine', 'Lives', 'vignettes', 'are', 'separated', 'sections', 'first', 'one', 'is:1', 'Dr', 'Keener', 'meet', 'woman', 'named', 'Dr', 'Keener', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'who', 'taking', 'care', 'elderly', 'woman', 'fortune', 'teller', 'Calista', 'Flockhart', 'house', 'future.2', 'Fantasies', 'Rebecca', 'Rebecca', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'pregnant', 'Meanwhile', 'sex', 'co-worker', 'Matt', 'Craven', 'chats', 'homeless', 'woman.3', 'Someone', 'Rose', 'children', 'book', 'writer', 'named', 'Rose', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'dwarf', 'named', 'Albert', 'Danny', 'Wood', 'street', 'son', 'Jay', 'shocking', 'revelation.4', 'Good', 'Night', 'Lilly', 'Good', 'Night', 'Christine', 'most', 'affecting', 'vignettes', 'story', 'returning', 'fortune', 'teller', 'Christine', 'Flockhart', 'who', 'lover', 'Lilly', 'Valeria', 'Golino', 'dies.5', 'Love', 'Waits', 'Kathy', 'detective', 'named', 'Kathy', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', 'deals', 'loneliness', 'blind', 'sister', 'Carol', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'bonds', 'man', 'named', 'Walter', 'Matt', 'Craven', 'nutshell', 'synopsis', 'vignettes', 'are', 'affecting', 'think', 'most', 'entertaining', 'one', 'Someone', 'Rose', 'said', 'most', 'affecting', 'Good', 'Night', 'Lilly', 'Good', 'Night', 'Christine', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'best', 'performance', 'movie', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'completely', 'understated', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'very', 'few', 'flaws', 'vignettes', 'drag', 'too', 'long', 'not', 'Garcia', 'fault', 'first', 'movie', 'show', 'amazing', 'talent', 'going', 'woman', 'life', 'few', 'moments', 'making', 'something', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out.GRADE', 'B+']",Things You Can Tell Just By Looking at Her VHS

I picked it up half a dozen times at the video store, and finally rented it the other night.Plot wise, it tells the story of several women, linked by emotion and random (or not)encounters with one another. (One woman struggles with her love for her sister and her social needs, another with her dying lover, one with her deep yearning for a love beyond her relationship with her son, another with an unplanned pregnancy, and so forth).  We are given glimpses into their private and outside worlds.What truly holds the movie together as a solid piece, instead of a movie version of a short story anthology, is the examination of these women's lives.  Within each story an undercurrent of universal emotion tugs and ties the women and the viewer together.The idea of telling the stories of several people and weaving them together unexpectedly is nothing new.  Quentin Tarantino unleashed the idea into the major mainstream with Pulp Fiction, and I've seen it played out since then, many times, successfully and unsuccessfully.In this movie the interweaving is done with a delicate touch.  In fact, the whole movie has a quiet grace to it.  The moments of these women's lives that we're given a peek into are brimming with pain, love, confusion, and unexpected moments hovering near joy.What stunning performances!

581575,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005BKZD,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[60, 62]","I stumbled across this film on cable and was drawn by the cast, as most people would be when they see this impressive roster of actresses.  I must have seen the title of this film, but really did not pay attention to it.  Of course, the title is key to this &quot;anthology&quot; field written and directed by Rodrigo Garcia (yes, believe it or not, this film was created by a male of the species).  I picked up on this just by noticing how the first &quot;segment&quot; has Christine (Calista Flockhart) give Dr. Keener (Glenn Close) a tarot card reading while the second has Rebecca (Holly Hunter) a series of similarly disquieting encounters with a bag lady (Penelope Allen).  Of course, the &quot;who&quot; and the &quot;how&quot; of the &quot;just by looking&quot; is different in each segment of the film, which is just part of the creative brilliance of this film.&quot;Thing You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her&quot; is not one of those films where the pieces all fit together (e.g, is Robert married to Rebecca's doctor?), although the ending does try to suggest that each of the five main characters (add Kathy Baker as Rose and Amy Brenneman as Kathy to the above referenced actresses) have crossed a major bridge in their lives.  Most of the characters appear in more than one segment, symbolism the inherent resonance between segments, and I liked the way one of the characters was both a &quot;looker&quot; and a &quot;lookee&quot; at different times in the film's narrative web.  Another major strength of the film is how Garcia always goes off in an unexpected and unusual direction throughout the film.  You are constantly surprised by what is happening, not to mention what is being said, which is often outrageously compelling.Garcia is the son of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Columbian writer who earned the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982.  I am sure that bit of biographical information helps to explain why Garcia crafted such an exquisite little film, but do not ask me to articulate why in any comprehensible way concerning the old nature verus nuture argument.  The performances are uniformly superb: Holly Hunter was nominated for an Emmy, simply because this film was sold to Showtime instead of getting a traditional theatrical run.  Hunter does have the best acting moment in the film, a scene in which she walks down the street (you will know it when you see it).  Much was made of Cameron Diaz's performance as Carol, the blind sister of Kathy, but I recognized a while ago that Diaz is a &quot;former model&quot; who takes her acting craft and film choices very seriously.  I think Calista Flockhart might be the actress who most impresses you.  But as much as you will be impressed by the performances of these outstanding actresses, you have to be even most impressed by writer-director Garcia.I am so glad I stumbled across this film.  It has been quite a while since I have been this impressed by a film.  I need to go check out more &quot;independent&quot; films, that is for sure.",5,A fascinating character study from Rodrigo Garcia,1031011200,"09 3, 2002",2002,3021,"['stumbled', 'film', 'cable', 'was', 'drawn', 'cast', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'when', 'see', 'impressive', 'roster', 'actresses', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'title', 'film', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'pay', 'attention', 'course', 'title', 'key', 'quot', 'anthology', 'quot', 'field', 'written', 'directed', 'Rodrigo', 'Garcia', 'yes', 'believe', 'not', 'film', 'was', 'created', 'male', 'species', 'picked', 'up', 'just', 'noticing', 'how', 'first', 'quot', 'segment', 'quot', 'Christine', 'Calista', 'Flockhart', 'give', 'Dr', 'Keener', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'tarot', 'card', 'reading', 'second', 'Rebecca', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'series', 'similarly', 'disquieting', 'encounters', 'bag', 'lady', 'Penelope', 'Allen', 'course', 'quot', 'who', 'quot', 'quot', 'how', 'quot', 'quot', 'just', 'looking', 'quot', 'different', 'segment', 'film', 'just', 'part', 'creative', 'brilliance', 'film.', 'quot', 'Thing', 'Can', 'Tell', 'Just', 'Looking', 'Her', 'quot', 'not', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'pieces', 'fit', 'together', 'e.g', 'Robert', 'married', 'Rebecca', 'doctor', 'ending', 'try', 'suggest', 'five', 'main', 'characters', 'add', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'Rose', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', 'Kathy', 'above', 'referenced', 'actresses', 'have', 'crossed', 'major', 'bridge', 'lives', 'Most', 'characters', 'appear', 'more', 'one', 'segment', 'symbolism', 'inherent', 'resonance', 'segments', 'liked', 'way', 'one', 'characters', 'was', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'different', 'times', 'film', 'narrative', 'web', 'major', 'strength', 'film', 'how', 'Garcia', 'always', 'off', 'unexpected', 'unusual', 'direction', 'film', 'are', 'constantly', 'surprised', 'what', 'happening', 'not', 'mention', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'often', 'outrageously', 'son', 'Gabriel', 'Garcia', 'Marquez', 'Columbian', 'writer', 'who', 'earned', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'Literature', '1982', 'am', 'sure', 'bit', 'biographical', 'information', 'explain', 'why', 'Garcia', 'crafted', 'exquisite', 'little', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'ask', 'articulate', 'why', 'comprehensible', 'way', 'concerning', 'old', 'nature', 'verus', 'nuture', 'argument', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'superb', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'was', 'nominated', 'Emmy', 'simply', 'film', 'was', 'sold', 'Showtime', 'instead', 'getting', 'traditional', 'theatrical', 'run', 'Hunter', 'have', 'best', 'acting', 'moment', 'film', 'scene', 'walks', 'down', 'street', 'will', 'know', 'when', 'see', 'Much', 'was', 'made', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'performance', 'Carol', 'blind', 'sister', 'Kathy', 'recognized', 'while', 'Diaz', 'quot', 'former', 'model', 'quot', 'who', 'acting', 'craft', 'film', 'choices', 'very', 'seriously', 'think', 'Calista', 'Flockhart', 'might', 'be', 'actress', 'who', 'most', 'impresses', 'as', 'much', 'will', 'be', 'impressed', 'performances', 'outstanding', 'actresses', 'have', 'be', 'even', 'most', 'impressed', 'writer-director', 'Garcia.I', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'stumbled', 'film', 'been', 'quite', 'while', 'have', 'been', 'impressed', 'film', 'need', 'go', 'check', 'out', 'more', 'quot', 'independent', 'quot', 'films', 'sure']",Things You Can Tell Just By Looking at Her VHS

581578,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005BKZD,Matthew Horner,"[50, 51]","One evening in the spring of 2000, I was at the movies and saw a poster for Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her. What an interesting title, I thought. And what a cast! I put the movie on my mental list of ones I planned to see. It never played at that theater. It never played in any theater in North America, although it was released in Europe, South America and Japan. Instead, it was sold to a big cable TV movie channel. MGM decided that it was too small a film for American audiences. I think their decision was unfortunate. Many movies intended for a limited audience have successful theatrical runs, and as so-called small movies go, this is an awfully big one. I hope it finds the audience it deserves on video.Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her does not have a conventional plot. It is five stories or vignettes loosely tied together. As the title implies, they are about women. In the first one, Glenn Close plays a doctor who is successful in her professional life but not in her personal oen. Her rather cold exterior masks the fact that she is starved for affection. It is Close's best role in years. Next we meet Rebecca [Holly Hunter], a bank manager on the edge of forty, whose almost casual decision to have an abortion leads to unexpected emotional complications. There is Rose [Kathy Baker], a single Mom who writes children's books and who does her best at raising her precocious fifteen year old son. She finds herself attracted to her new next-door neighbor, a smart and confident guy who just happens to be a dwarf. Christie [Calista Flockheart] and Lilly [Valeria Golino] are lovers facing one of life's toughest battles. Finally, there is the tale of Carol [Cameron Diaz], a blind woman who understands and 'sees' life much more clearly than her repressed sister, Kathy [Amy Brenneman].None of these stories may sound like much, but the success of a story always lies in its telling. Director Rodrigo Garcia is a master story teller. He never lets the movie drift into melodrama. The characters and the subject matters could easily lend themselves to titillation and to cheap thrills, but in the hands of this masterful director, we see these characters simply as people doing the best they know how to do despite their handicaps, both physical and emotional. This movie is very human, and that's fairly rare these days.The cast, of course, is a remarkable group of actors. It is amazing to see them all together in one movie. What truly impressed me was the fact that all of them seems to have outdone themselves. While some of their roles are not large, I cannot think of an instance in which any of them have given a better performance. For acting buffs, the film is a rare treat.When we refer to a movie as small, I think we generally mean one that does not get the adrenaline flowing. If so, Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her certainly fits the description. Anyone addicted to explosions, car chases and pumped up characters mindlessly spewing profanities will want to avoid this one. Those who like a little heart and soul, not to mention some intelligence, in their movies should find this one to be a rare treat.",4,Extraordinary little movie,1016150400,"03 15, 2002",2002,3169,"['One', 'evening', 'spring', '2000', 'was', 'movies', 'saw', 'poster', 'Things', 'Can', 'Tell', 'Just', 'Looking', 'Her', 'What', 'interesting', 'title', 'thought', 'what', 'cast', 'put', 'movie', 'mental', 'list', 'ones', 'planned', 'see', 'never', 'played', 'theater', 'never', 'played', 'theater', 'North', 'America', 'was', 'released', 'Europe', 'South', 'America', 'Japan', 'Instead', 'was', 'sold', 'big', 'cable', 'TV', 'movie', 'channel', 'MGM', 'decided', 'was', 'too', 'small', 'film', 'American', 'audiences', 'think', 'decision', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'Many', 'movies', 'intended', 'limited', 'audience', 'have', 'successful', 'theatrical', 'runs', 'so-called', 'small', 'movies', 'go', 'awfully', 'big', 'one', 'hope', 'audience', 'video.Things', 'Can', 'Tell', 'Just', 'Looking', 'Her', 'not', 'have', 'conventional', 'plot', 'five', 'stories', 'vignettes', 'loosely', 'tied', 'together', 'title', 'implies', 'are', 'women', 'first', 'one', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'doctor', 'who', 'successful', 'professional', 'life', 'not', 'personal', 'oen', 'rather', 'cold', 'exterior', 'masks', 'fact', 'starved', 'affection', 'Close', 'best', 'role', 'years', 'meet', 'Rebecca', '[', 'Holly', 'Hunter', ']', 'bank', 'manager', 'edge', 'forty', 'almost', 'casual', 'decision', 'have', 'abortion', 'unexpected', 'emotional', 'complications', 'Rose', '[', 'Kathy', 'Baker', ']', 'single', 'Mom', 'who', 'children', 'books', 'who', 'best', 'raising', 'precocious', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'attracted', 'new', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'smart', 'confident', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'dwarf', 'Christie', '[', 'Calista', 'Flockheart', ']', 'Lilly', '[', 'Valeria', 'Golino', ']', 'are', 'lovers', 'facing', 'one', 'life', 'toughest', 'battles', 'Finally', 'tale', 'Carol', '[', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', ']', 'blind', 'woman', 'who', ""'sees"", 'life', 'much', 'more', 'clearly', 'repressed', 'sister', 'Kathy', '[', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', ']', '.None', 'stories', 'may', 'sound', 'much', 'success', 'story', 'always', 'telling', 'Director', 'Rodrigo', 'Garcia', 'master', 'story', 'teller', 'never', 'movie', 'drift', 'melodrama', 'characters', 'subject', 'matters', 'could', 'easily', 'lend', 'titillation', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'hands', 'masterful', 'director', 'see', 'characters', 'simply', 'people', 'doing', 'best', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'handicaps', 'physical', 'emotional', 'movie', 'very', 'human', 'fairly', 'rare', 'days.The', 'cast', 'course', 'remarkable', 'group', 'actors', 'amazing', 'see', 'together', 'one', 'movie', 'What', 'truly', 'impressed', 'was', 'fact', 'have', 'outdone', 'roles', 'are', 'not', 'large', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'instance', 'have', 'given', 'better', 'performance', 'acting', 'buffs', 'film', 'rare', 'treat.When', 'refer', 'movie', 'small', 'think', 'generally', 'mean', 'one', 'not', 'get', 'adrenaline', 'flowing', 'so', 'Can', 'Tell', 'Just', 'Looking', 'Her', 'certainly', 'description', 'Anyone', 'addicted', 'explosions', 'car', 'chases', 'pumped', 'up', 'characters', 'mindlessly', 'spewing', 'profanities', 'will', 'want', 'avoid', 'one', 'who', 'like', 'little', 'heart', 'soul', 'not', 'mention', 'intelligence', 'movies', 'should', 'find', 'one', 'be', 'rare', 'treat']",Things You Can Tell Just By Looking at Her VHS
581579,A13U4RT7VHFD18,B00005BKZD,"M. Colford ""chlotrudis""","[18, 21]","Rodrigo Garc&iacute;a's moving, anthological film about women, features strong writing, a top-notch cast (Glen Close, Holly Hunter, Kathy Baker, Cameron Diaz, Calista Flockhart... just to name a few) and unfortunately, despite big raves at Sundance last year... no distributor. Thank God for cable television. Showtime picked up this film so at least some people got to see it. And now it's available on video and DVD.In THINGS YOU CAN TELL JUST BY LOOKING AT HER, Garc&iacute;a has attempted an Altman-like anthology. But while Altman often takes a sprawling story and links them tangentially with the numerous characters, Garc&iacute;a looks at a series of small, intimate stories that are also tangentially linked by supporting characters. Each of the stories deals with women... and the differences between what these women present to the world, and what they hold inside. In each story, there are characters who see beyond the masks these women wear to their inner cores... Callista Flockhart's tarot card reader, &quot;Nancy&quot; the insightful homeless woman who sees through Holly Hunter's tough, capable bank manager, Cameron Diaz' blind woman who might be a better detective than her sister, played by Amy Brenneman. It was refreshing to watch a movie about women as individuals, and not just as appendages to the men who are the real stars.Unfortunately, the stories were uneven... with some standouts (Kathy Baker's single-mom who becomes fascinated by Albert, a dwarf who moves into the house across the street) and some surprisingly inert (Callista Flockhart caring for her lover (Valeria Golina) who is dying of cancer). I think the movie could have been tightened up, with some storylines being more deeply explored (Kathy Baker's or Holly Hunter's) and others being discarded.

581580,A3MS0KUOYHIQK4,B00005BKZD,Mint910,"[4, 5]","Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her is a series of vignettes that are all somehow connected. Basically the equivalent of a really good short story collection! Each story is about 20 or so minutes long and plays out almost to a conclusion but then skips to the next story where a new character or two are focused on but characters from the previous stories also appear. I love how this fits together so neatly and creates a whole world. So after all the characters have been introduced and their stories have begun it all comes full circle at the end and most (but not all) come to a conclusion of sorts.Of the 5 vignettes, I had two favorites, Someone For Rose and Love Waits For Kathy. Someone For Rose is so sweet, I think I squealed when I was watching it. It's the story of shy Kathy, the mother of a teenage son. One day a man moves in across the street and she finds herself really drawn to him but doesn't really know how to act around him. I don't want to say anymore than that. In Love Waits For Kathy, Kathy is the older sister of Carol, who is blind. They live together and you can sort of tell that Kathy has put her sister's happiness in front of her own. While Carol goes out on dates Kathy, who is a detective, works on the case of a suicide of someone she once knew.So I got this one because I saw something about it somewhere, no idea what and I love star studded power casts. It blew me away! I guess I shouldn't be surprised because of who is in this movie but I still was.

581581,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005BKZD,Reviewer,"[21, 22]","A sensitive and incisive episodic drama that examines loneliness and need, emotional vulnerability and the true meaning of character, ""Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her,"" written and directed by Rodrigo Garcia, presents a glimpse into the lives of seven women that is not only thoughtful, but filled with some real insights into human nature.  Though the stories are independent and unrelated, the film demonstrates how the lives of people can and do overlap, and whether or not they affect one another in any way, there are things these individuals have in common that have to do with relationships or the lack thereof, and is seemingly steeped in pain, despair, indecisiveness and longing.  It's a dialogue driven character study that may be the antithesis of a feel-good film, but it's riveting drama that is extremely well presented and acted, and most importantly it is very real and believable and will certainly contain elements to which just about anyone in the audience will be able to relate and identify, because they are so true-to-life.What you see in this film may not be entirely pleasant, but it provides some thought-provoking, reflective moments that are in some cases veritably transporting, and many that are bound to hit very close to home for many viewers.  Garcia seems to have a firm grasp of the female perspective and sensibility, and presents the stories of these women in a way that allows you to empathize with all of them on a number of different levels.  And he wisely offsets the drama by infusing a bit of tasteful humor at just the right moments, bittersweet though it may be; without it, the film would have been just too dark, and as it is, it hovers dangerously close to the cusp of the abyss, as he layers one disconcerting situation upon another with little respite.  It may sound like strong stuff, and it is; but it does what a film like this is supposed to do:  It makes you ""feel"" something, consider some things and enables you to possibly come to terms with some emotions that otherwise you may be wont to avoid altogether.  In the end, then, it makes for a truly satisfying and fulfilling experience.Garcia put together a terrific ensemble cast to tell his story, which resulted in a number of exemplary performances, most notably by Cameron Diaz, who plays Carol, a blind woman who refuses to acquiesce to the constant compromises life offers her.  She displays a fortitude that is inspiring and demonstrates that real vision, as well as true beauty, transcends the physical.  In her darkness, she sees and understands the world more clearly than many who see perfectly but are blind in other ways, and though in the care of her sister, Kathy (Amy Brenneman), it is she who enables Kathy to finally get a grasp on her own life.  It's a wonderful performance by Diaz, who continues to prove that she is so much more than just another pretty face up there on the screen.Another memorable performance is turned in by Kathy Baker, as Rose, the single mother of a fifteen-year-old son, Jay (Noah Fleiss), who is a woman of true inner beauty.  Rose is a former teacher who now writes children's storybooks, whom Baker instills with qualities that make her endearing and very real, including the capacity to look beyond herself and reach out to others, which in turn makes that necessary connection with the audience and predisposes the emotional involvement that makes her story so poignant and honest.  There's a gentleness that Baker brings to this role, and an openness, that makes it one of the best she's ever done.Notable performances are given, as well, by Glenn Close, as Dr. Elaine Keener, who has recently arrived at something of a crossroads in her life; Calista Flockhart, as Christine, a fortune teller whose own future with her girlfriend, Lilly (Valeria Golino) is clouded; and Holly Hunter, as Rebecca, a thirty-nine-year-old bank manager coping with the emptiness in her life brought about by, in retrospect, some questionable decisions she's made.  It is rare, in fact, to find so many singularly exceptional performances in a motion picture.The supporting cast includes Matt Craven (Walter), Gregory Hines (Robert), Miguel Sandoval (Sam), Danny Woodburn (Albert) and Penelope Allen (Nancy).  Engrossing drama, delivered with integrity and subtle nuance by Garcia and his impeccable cast, ""Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her"" in an introspective treatise on life and the many aspects of it that are common, but rarely shared because of the fact that so many people live, as Carol says at one point, ""Behind closed doors.""  It's a powerful film that makes a real impact without ever hitting you over the head with the weight of it's collective angst.  And it's an important film in that it will make you think and consider-- things that are too often put off or ignored entirely, and often to the detriment of personal happiness; and when the medium of the filmmaker can maybe turn that around, it demonstrates what the magic of the movies is really all about.",5,"Powerful, Introspective Drama",996883200,"08 4, 2001",2001,5035,"['sensitive',

It stars Glenn Close, Cameron Diaz, Amy Brennan, Holly Hunter, Karen Baker, and Calista Flockhart.There are 4 scenarios of their lives that intersect and influence them.

I saw it in a San Francisco theater with a quirky group of feminist friends and we all loved it--but I think the &quot;target audience&quot; (if there is any such thing) is just that--people who are heightened awareness of injustices, however subtle, in the way people are viewed.  This film features a doctor who appears calm and collected but in reality suffers from horrible insecurity and lonliness.  A tarot card reader (wonderfully portrayed by Calista Flockhart) who supposedly has all the answers sits helplessly as her lover succumbs to illness.  A feisty blind woman takes life (and men) lightly while her sister fumbles through a sterile, if successful, existence.  All in all, this film is not plot-driven; rather, it is meant to raise questions and leave viewers wondering about their last rash error in judgment.",5,"Not for everyone, but the target audience will love it",1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,887,"[""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'film', 'never', 'made', 'theaters', 'saw', 'San', 'Francisco', 'theater', 'quirky', 'group', 'feminist', 'friends', 'loved', 'think', 'quot', 'target', 'audience', 'quot', 'such', 'thing', 'just', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'heightened', 'injustices', 'however', 'subtle', 'way', 'people', 'are', 'viewed', 'film', 'doctor', 'who', 'calm', 'collected', 'reality', 'suffers', 'horrible', 'insecurity', 'lonliness', 'tarot', 'card', 'reader', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'Calista', 'Flockhart', 'who', 'supposedly', 'answers', 'helplessly', 'lover', 'succumbs', 'illness', 'feisty', 'blind', 'woman', 'life', 'men', 'lightly', 'sister', 'fumbles', 'sterile', 'successful', 'existence', 'film', 'not', 'plot-driven', 'rather', 'meant', 'raise', 'questions', 'leave', 'viewers', 'wondering', 'last', 'rash', 'error', 'judgment']",Things You Can Tell Just By Looking at Her VHS

Each  pearl of wisdom goes together with the next and with the previous, before coming full circle and clasping shut. These are lovely tales done by a genuine storyteller, writer and director Rodrigo Garcia.""Things You Can Tell Just By Looking at Her"" is an intoxicating title that will challenge your ideas about perception.  In this, there is a depiction behind every person. The very first woman that you see is police detective Kathy (Amy Brenneman) and it is with her vignette, along with sister Carol (Cameron Diaz) that the movie concludes.Story #1-'This Is Dr. Keener': Glenn Close as the doctor who is caring for her elderly mother, receives a visit with a mild mannered and spoken, Tarot Card reader Christine Taylor (Calista Flockhart). The telling of each card and the response is amazing.Story #2-'Fantasies Of Rebecca': Holly Hunter (Rebecca) has dalliances with two different men.  One ongoing affair with a married Robert (Gregory Hines) while taking up with another (Matt Craven). She is constantly challenged about herself and her morals by a judging woman.  Homeless and of whom the opinions Rebecca always entertains.Story #3-'Someone For Rose': A kind and nurturing single mother Rose (Kathy Baker) raises her young teenage son Jay.  Their interaction is wonderfully done while a new neighbor moves in across the street. Albert (Danny Woodburn) may be short in stature although has the heart of a giant.  I loved the scene with the Bonsai tree on the doorstep, it definitely moved me with this simple gesture.Story #4-'Goodnight Lilly Goodnight Christine': The matter of Christine (Tarot Card reader) is the small period in her life while she is caring for her girlfriend Lily (Valeria Golino). She is terminally ill and in her end stage.  They speak of the her fear of dying, and Christine tearfully repeats to Lilly their story.We are, without exception, treated to an outstanding ensemble of lead characters and a never disappointing 'add to' cast.  This enhances every minute detail: Danny Woodburn, Valerie Golino, Gregory Hines, Matt Craven and each of the others involved, are extremely necessary to the picture's success as a whole.This being more of a character study and movie, may not be to everyone's liking. For me it is smartly acted and my perception: What you first see is not what you necessarily get...",5,"""...Only A Fool Would Speculate About The Life Of A Woman"" - Carol",1351468800,"10 29, 2012",2012,2407,"['pearl', 'necklace', 'vignettes', 'are', 'strung', 'other', 'pearl', 'wisdom', 'together', 'next', 'previous', 'coming', 'full', 'circle', 'clasping', 'shut', 'are', 'lovely', 'tales', 'done', 'genuine', 'storyteller', 'writer', 'director', 'Rodrigo', 'Garcia', 'Can', 'Tell', 'Just', 'Looking', 'Her', 'intoxicating', 'title', 'will', 'challenge', 'ideas', 'perception', 'depiction', 'person', 'very', 'first', 'woman', 'see', 'police', 'detective', 'Kathy', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', 'vignette', 'sister', 'Carol', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'movie', 'concludes.Story', ""1-'This"", 'Is', 'Dr', 'Keener', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'doctor', 'who', 'caring', 'elderly', 'mother', 'visit', 'mild', 'mannered', 'spoken', 'Tarot', 'Card', 'reader', 'Christine', 'Taylor', 'Calista', 'Flockhart', 'telling', 'card', 'response', 'amazing.Story', ""2-'Fantasies"", 'Rebecca', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Rebecca', 'dalliances', 'two', 'different', 'men', 'One', 'ongoing', 'affair', 'married', 'Robert', 'Gregory', 'Hines', 'taking', 'up', 'Matt', 'Craven', 'constantly', 'challenged', 'herself', 'morals', 'judging', 'woman', 'Homeless', 'whom', 'opinions', 'Rebecca', 'always', 'entertains.Story', ""3-'Someone"", 'Rose', 'kind', 'nurturing', 'single', 'mother', 'Rose', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'young', 'teenage', 'son', 'Jay', 'interaction', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'new', 'neighbor', 'moves', 'street', 'Albert', 'Danny', 'Woodburn', 'may', 'be', 'short', 'stature', 'heart', 'giant', 'loved', 'scene', 'Bonsai', 'tree', 'doorstep', 'definitely', 'moved', 'simple', 'gesture.Story', ""4-'Goodnight"", 'Lilly', 'Goodnight', 'Christine', 'matter', 'Christine', 'Tarot', 'Card', 'reader', 'small', 'period', 'life', 'caring', 'girlfriend', 'Lily', 'Valeria', 'Golino', 'terminally', 'ill', 'end', 'stage', 'speak', 'fear', 'dying', 'Christine', 'tearfully', 'Lilly', 'story.We', 'are', 'exception', 'treated', 'outstanding', 'ensemble', 'lead', 'characters', 'never', 'disappointing', 'cast', 'minute', 'detail', 'Danny', 'Woodburn', 'Valerie', 'Golino', 'Gregory', 'Hines', 'Matt', 'Craven', 'others', 'involved', 'are', 'extremely', 'necessary', 'picture', 'success', 'whole.This', 'being', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'liking', 'smartly', 'acted', 'perception', 'What', 'first', 'see', 'not', 'what', 'necessarily', 'get']",Things You Can Tell Just By Looking at Her VHS

581586,A2W7GQG04QCEVT,B00005BKZD,Wendell,"[7, 7]","Great film. The director did a marvelous job with this one. It's a quiet film that requires a lot from the viewer. He gave a hint of that with the title. This is really a film where you need to look closely at the actreses. Watch every move. There's so much going on underneath the surface and that's what this is about.The scene where the Glenn close character has her fortune read is a great example. If you watch her face as she listens there's an entire string of different thoughts that just barely betray themselves on the surface. Anger, denial, defensiveness, acceptance, sorrow... All these things appear and disappear without Close having ever said a word. Very well done.Not, of course, for viewers with short attention spans, or those who've grown up on average Hollywood fare. This is, in many ways, a Latin American movie. It feels more at home beside Amores Perros or Twenty-One Grams than it does beside most movies from American directors. This is a very good thing.
