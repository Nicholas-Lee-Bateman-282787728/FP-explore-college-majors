However, the network people did not believ that America was ready for an action hero that was Asian so they went back and re-wrote the script and made the character half chinese,and enlisted David Carridine,or the famous acting family. the result was an existential post-modern western,filled with eatsern mystcim and kung fu kickass. the premise of the show: an orpahned half american/half Chinese boy goes to the famous Shoalin temple to become a monk, and is forced to endure rigors before he's allowed inside. After an accident and a moment of anger, the now grown monk is forced to emigrate to the other home of his ancestors, america, filled with contempt for Chinese immigrants.Along the way he encounters various nasty Railroad overseers[the infrastructure of this country was bulit on the backs of slaves and immigrants in large parts],sherrifs and assasins sent by the Chinese government. Carradine is perfect in his portrayal as the taciturn monk/warrior,silent almost letting the breaths speak[alot of silence for a television show] the great Key Luke was on hand to deal with the flashbacks as young Caines mentor in the Saolin temple[Carridines younger brother Keith pays him in the pilot as a younger man].In all, a throughly enjoyable nostalgic trip ,and a good addition to the televison library.

792191,A1KRAV23YTSUTF,B00013F38K,"Arthur D. O'Brien ""Art""","[13, 16]","Nothing more can be said by me about the content and quality of ""Kung Fu,"" the great 1970s TV series, that has not already been said below.  However, the debate over the ""letterboxing"" of the series seems to me to miss the point, and I feel the need to address it.When feature films that were filmed in various widescreen formats were first brought to VHS in a full-screen format, there was an outcry that the ""chopping off"" of the sides of the picture destroyed the artist's vision.  In this """"de-letterboxing,"" the careful staging of scenes is invariably destroyed and sometimes leaves out crucial visual information, often leaving scenes with characters appearing to be talking to themselves (their adressees were cut out of the picture).  If cutting the sides off of a widescreen film is ""wrong""  to viewers who would like to see a film in its original format, how can anyone argue that the ""letterboxing"" (cutting off the top and bottom of the picture) of a television series that originally appeared in a full-screen format be acceptable?  It is hypocrisy at its height!Until the early 1990s, all television show productions used a full-screen presentation for their shows.  At that time a few, high-profile TV dramas began presenting in a widescreen format; one that is fairly common among TV dramas today.  In the earliest days of TV, there was never any consideration that their programs be shot in a widescreen format, a format many felt befitted the greater status films held at the time.  Full-screen for television was the standard.""Kung Fu,"" filmed in the early to mid-1970s, was typical of all television productions of the time.  It was filmed in a full-screen aspect ratio.  The producers of this new DVD version of ""Kung Fu"" seem to have mistaken the outcry for widescreen films to be presented in widescreen format as a cry for ALL DVDs released to be presented in a widescreen format.  That could not be further from the truth.Whether you like or hate what has been done to ""Kung Fu,"" it is being presented in a format in which it was never intended to be viewed.  This in and of itself diminishes the artistic integrity of those people that created the series for 1970s audiences (arguably, artistic integrity that may or may not have existed at the time, but we don't know that for sure, do we?).Some reviewers on these pages suggest that letterboxing somehow enhances the picture quality.  This could not be further from the truth as one has nothing to do with the other.  Good picture quality starts with the best possible source, and letterboxing a full screen picture can have no effect in that regard.  Additionally, the fact that some reviewers do not FEEL they are ""missing anything"" is beside the point.  You ARE missing something; something original viewers saw, but that you may never see.  Can you imagine the outcry if the same widescreen treatment was given to the forthcoming ""Star Trek"" season series' DVDs to be released later this month?  I cringe at the very idea!  It is no less a mistake for ""Kung Fu.""Once again, it was a mistake to release ""Kung Fu"" in anything other than its original format, and this mistake should be rectified.  However, since this is unlikely, don't let this keep you from experiencing one of television's landmark series.  Since a letterboxed version is all that is available, if you really want to see the show, there is no other choice.  One can only hope the producers will come to their senses with seasons two and three.",5,About the Letterboxing...,1092096000,"08 10, 2004",2004,3492,"['Nothing', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'content', 'quality', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'great', '1970s', 'TV', 'series', 'not', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'However', 'debate', 'letterboxing', 'series', 'miss', 'point', 'feel', 'need', 'address', 'it.When', 'feature', 'films', 'were', 'filmed', 'various', 'widescreen', 'formats', 'were', 'first', 'brought', 'VHS', 'full-screen', 'format', 'was', 'outcry', 'chopping', 'off', 'sides', 'picture', 'destroyed', 'artist', 'vision', 'de-letterboxing', 'careful', 'staging', 'scenes', 'invariably', 'destroyed', 'sometimes', 'out', 'crucial', 'visual', 'information', 'often', 'leaving', 'scenes', 'characters', 'appearing', 'be', 'talking', 'adressees', 'were', 'cut', 'picture', 'cutting', 'sides', 'widescreen', 'film', 'wrong', 'viewers', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'film', 'original', 'format', 'how', 'can', 'anyone', 'argue', 'letterboxing', 'cutting', 'off', 'top', 'bottom', 'picture', 'television', 'series', 'originally', 'appeared', 'full-screen', 'format', 'be', 'acceptable', 'hypocrisy', 'height', 'early', '1990s', 'television', 'show', 'productions', 'used', 'full-screen', 'presentation', 'shows', 'time', 'few', 'high-profile', 'TV', 'dramas', 'began', 'presenting', 'widescreen', 'format', 'one', 'fairly', 'common', 'TV', 'dramas', 'today', 'earliest', 'days', 'TV', 'was', 'never', 'consideration', 'programs', 'be', 'shot', 'widescreen', 'format', 'format', 'many', 'felt', 'befitted', 'greater', 'status', 'films', 'held', 'time', 'Full-screen', 'television', 'was', 'standard', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'filmed', 'early', 'mid-1970s', 'was', 'typical', 'television', 'productions', 'time', 'was', 'filmed', 'full-screen', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'producers', 'new', 'DVD', 'version', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'seem', 'have', 'mistaken', 'outcry', 'widescreen', 'films', 'be', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'format', 'cry', 'ALL', 'DVDs', 'released', 'be', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'format', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'further', 'truth.Whether', 'hate', 'been', 'done', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'being', 'presented', 'format', 'was', 'never', 'intended', 'be', 'viewed', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'people', 'created', 'series', '1970s', 'audiences', 'arguably', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'existed', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sure', 'do', '.Some', 'reviewers', 'pages', 'suggest', 'letterboxing', 'somehow', 'picture', 'quality', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'one', 'nothing', 'do', 'other', 'Good', 'picture', 'quality', 'best', 'possible', 'source', 'letterboxing', 'full', 'screen', 'picture', 'can', 'have', 'effect', 'regard', 'Additionally', 'fact', 'reviewers', 'do', 'not', 'FEEL', 'are', 'missing', 'anything', 'beside', 'point', 'ARE', 'missing', 'something', 'something', 'original', 'viewers', 'saw', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'Can', 'imagine', 'outcry', 'same', 'widescreen', 'treatment', 'was', 'given', 'forthcoming', 'Star', 'Trek', 'season', 'series', 'DVDs', 'be', 'released', 'later', 'month', 'cringe', 'very', 'idea', 'less', 'mistake', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Once', 'again', 'was', 'mistake', 'release', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'anything', 'other', 'original', 'format', 'mistake', 'should', 'be', 'rectified', 'However', 'unlikely', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'keep', 'experiencing', 'one', 'television', 'landmark', 'series', 'letterboxed', 'version', 'available', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'show', 'other', 'choice', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'producers', 'will', 'come', 'senses', 'seasons', 'two', 'three']",N/A

Watching it now, I realize how unique this show was and how lucky the producers were to have an actor with David Carradine's talents in the lead role. Carradine is able, by just changing his expression slightly, to show us boundless joy, total disgust, and plain happiness at being alive. I don't think many actors could do this so well.  No, the martial arts are not as flashy as they would have been with Bruce Lee, but that isn't the point.  Besides, they are OK especially the way the action sequences were filmed. And, just like Bob Seger says about ""today's music""...well, today's TV ""ain't got the same soul"".  This show's philosophies are just so much better than most anything else.  Peace, happiness, sharing, kindness...the list goes on and on.  Find THAT in any of today's shows.  I don't think that TV could make this show these days, and that is a real pity.

It presents such great values as fighting (fiercely) only in self-defense, helping your brother (or sister) no matter who they are or where they come from, and always trying to do the right thing for the right reasons. Much of the wisdom imparted by Master Kan and Master Po must have gone right over the heads of the early '70s audience, but what these masters say--when you really think about it--makes important sense today.Much has been made by other reviewers about the change of the aspect ratio from full-frame TV to a kind of &quot;pseudo-widescreen&quot;. I was aware of these complaints, but I myself never noticed any problems with the picture. The transfer is actually quite beautiful and does a great honor to a TV show of this era. David Carradine, despite his lack of Asian heritage, is perfect in this role (Caine is really only half-Chinese), and he treats this part with the profound respect it deserves.

If the fighting scenes look less dramatic to audiences used to the high skills and special effects of today's martial arts movies, the gentle message of stoic tolerance holds up extremely with time.  This DVD set contains the pilot TV movie and the 15 episodes which comprised the first season, along with a few extra features on the production of the show.The format of the show will be familiar to its fans.  Caine wanders the American West of roughly the 1870's, on the run from the killing of a member of the Chinese Royal Family.  Caine, half American and half Chinese, will search for a long missing brother while dodging Chinese agents and US law.  Each episode pits Caine against a situation in the present to which his past as a disciple and a priest in a Shaolin Temple in China provides guidance.  The parallel story arcs allow the viewer to see how the young Caine learns the wisdom and discipline the mature Caine applies in the present.  The stories were driven by subtle moral dilemmas and by a rotating cast of guest stars, of which this first season features Jody Foster and John Saxon, among others.

792213,A3MQ3IIFGLQ2PO,B00013F38K,E. Hornaday,"[96, 120]","The TV series Kung Fu, starring David Carradine, Keye Luke and Philip Ahn, became an American popular cultural phenomenon in the 70s and richly deserves a full DVD release. It remains as unique today as it did three decades ago, and potentially as powerful.In the 70s, America was still embroiled in the Vietnam War when Carradine, who played Kwai Chang Caine, walked barefoot into the homes of viewers portraying a Chinese priest of the Shaolin Order who was also a Kung Fu martial arts expert.Through Caine, complex themes of religion, spirituality, philosophy, violence, peace, racism, morality, greed, human dignity and cruelty were examined each week in the guise of an off-beat Western set in the 1800s.Caine, who was part American, was forced to flee his homeland after his mentor, Master Po, portrayed brilliantly by Luke, was murdered by a royal guardman, who in turn was killed by Caine. The royal family issued an edict to capture Caine --- dead or alive.Caine came to America in search of his half-brother, walking from town to town following leads as to his sibling's whereabouts.While the story seems simple enough, it afforded the show's writers ample opportunities to explore the aforementioned themes by depicting Caine's interaction with those who lived in America's Old West, illustrating through the use of extensive flash-backs, the teachings of his Shaolin masters and his Chinese martial arts training. It also provided plenty of excitement and action through Carradine's use of Kung Fu in America, which he frequently employed to protect the less fortunate or otherwise vulnerable victim.Caine's cultural views and religious training that stressed peaceful coexistance with his fellow man, equality and non-materialism, put him at odds with most of those he encountered. Every episode presented moral choices for Caine to make between maintaining his lifestyle and philosophy, or conforming to the norms of American society. In presenting those choices, viewers also examined their own values as well as those of modern society at a time when it was imperitive to do so.Famed martial artist and actor Bruce Lee developed the show's concept with producers and had expected to be cast as Caine.

My only complaint is that the top and bottom of the screen are cut out, to make it ""wide screen"". Crazy. It does make the product look slyer, but by taking away from the show. However, so little is lost, and you soon forget that anything is missing. This is such a classic series, who cares? Kung Fu on DVD! I would list the episodes, but below Corgweyn has done this nicely.For those of you unfamiliar with the show, allow me to give you a brief but honest rundown: A ""western"", of sorts, Kung-Fu deals with a Shaelin Priest (Cain) who is outlawed after killing his old blind master Po, the Emperor's nephew. Being half Chinese, half American, he escapes to the ""old west"" of America, embarking on a series of adventures, dealing with racist cowboys, blood-thirsty bounty hunters, and Chinese assassins sent to kill or return him. (He is worth $10,000 alive, $5,000 dead.) This is a classic and unique series, dealing far more with humanity, Chinese philosophy and wisdom than fighting. Its occult value is hot, and its incredible acting and stories are memorable and striking. A show for those who like something different, where truth and gentleness can win out over lies and crudeness. He is one with nature.

792220,A366S12KCZ280V,B00013F38K,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[0, 0]","When you think of the great TV westerns of television most people would probably think right off the bat shows like ""Gunsmoke"", ""Bonanza"" or ""The Big Valley"" or a host of other westerns that can be found now on ME TV. But there was one western that was sooooo different then all the others. So unique and original that brought westerns to a new level. That show was ""Kung Fu"". Starring the late David Carradine as Kwai Chang Caine the show introduced eastern philosophy to the west as well as showing them the martial art form of Kung Fu. It certainly made for an interesting confrontations every week on the show between the rugged individualistic shoot now and ask questions later cowboy against the mild mannered Shaolin priest with his different ways. Talk about a clash of cultures!But that is way ""Kung Fu"" was and still is one of my personal all time favorite TV shows. There had never been nothing like it before and nothing like it since. (Unless you count the ""Kung Fu: The Legend Continues"" series that was on TV back in the '90s and starred David Carradine) While to story lines could be fairly predictable they could still leave viewers glued to the set watching how Caine lived and reacted to this new land that was so vast and so different from the world he knew in China. At the same time Caine would change how the west saw him and understand the principals he lived his life by. Throughout it all Caine would have flashbacks as events occurred reminding him of simular events that occurred to him when he was back in China at the temple. These flashbacks helped Caine to deal or at least understand the situation he was facing at that moment. And then of course there was the fighting. Not your typical barroom brawls either like you see in westerns but fighting moves with kicks, throws, punches and chops. One of the best parts of the show was seeing how these rough tough cowboys reacted as they started fighting this skinny ""Chinaman"" who didn't look like he could punch his way out of a wet paper sack only to find themselves on the ground wondering what just hit them.In addition to Carradine the other stars of the show included Philip Ahn as Master Khan, Keye Luke as Master Po and Radames Pera as Caine as a young boy (aka ""Grasshopper""). The show usually attacted some great guest star appearences as well including Jim Davis, Gregory Sierra, Roscoe Lee Browne, Gary Bussy, Chief Dan George and a very young Jodie Foster are among them. Of coarse if you are a fan of this show there is no need to recommend you get this box set of season 1 (or season 2 or 3 for that matter). You may already have it or planning on getting it. But for those of you who don't know of this series or where too young at the time to watch it when it was on then consider getting this. Especially if you love a TV show that is not like anything else on television. I think you will find you will not be disappointed.The picture quality is very good. I don't know if it has been remastered while going from tape onto disc but I have no complaints. Also I read a couple of reviews for this where the reviewer said the pictures had been cropped to widescreen. Why anyone would do that to something that was specifically made for television makes no sence to me but I can say that my copy of season 1 appears in normal screen format. It does sound like if you are going to purchase yourself a copy of season 1 you will want to make sure how the picture has been formatted.Season 1 is short compaired to the other two seasons. The first season was only 15 episodes but it does include the pilot movie that helped get the series started. All the more reason to get this DVD and it does help if you see the movie to know more about Caine and the events that led him to become a student at the temple and why he had to leave China and come to America.",5,Not A Typical Western,1342396800,"07 16, 2012",2012,3849,"['When', 'think', 'great', 'TV', 'westerns', 'television', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'probably', 'think', 'right', 'bat', 'Gunsmoke', 'Bonanza', 'Big', 'Valley', 'host', 'other', 'westerns', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'now', 'ME', 'TV', 'was', 'one', 'western', 'was', 'sooooo', 'different', 'then', 'others', 'So', 'unique', 'original', 'brought', 'westerns', 'new', 'level', 'show', 'was', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Starring', 'late', 'David', 'Carradine', 'Kwai', 'Chang', 'Caine', 'show', 'introduced', 'eastern', 'philosophy', 'west', 'as', 'well', 'showing', 'martial', 'art', 'form', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'certainly', 'made', 'interesting', 'confrontations', 'week', 'show', 'rugged', 'individualistic', 'shoot', 'now', 'ask', 'questions', 'later', 'cowboy', 'mild', 'mannered', 'Shaolin', 'priest', 'different', 'ways', 'Talk', 'clash', 'cultures', 'way', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'was', 'still', 'one', 'personal', 'time', 'favorite', 'TV', 'shows', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'nothing', 'nothing', 'count', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Legend', 'Continues', 'series', 'was', 'TV', 'back', ""'90s"", 'starred', 'David', 'Carradine', 'story', 'lines', 'could', 'be', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'could', 'still', 'leave', 'viewers', 'glued', 'set', 'watching', 'how', 'Caine', 'lived', 'reacted', 'new', 'land', 'was', 'so', 'vast', 'so', 'different', 'world', 'knew', 'China', 'same', 'time', 'Caine', 'would', 'change', 'how', 'west', 'saw', 'understand', 'principals', 'lived', 'life', 'Caine', 'would', 'have', 'flashbacks', 'events', 'occurred', 'reminding', 'simular', 'events', 'occurred', 'when', 'was', 'back', 'China', 'temple', 'flashbacks', 'helped', 'Caine', 'deal', 'least', 'understand', 'situation', 'was', 'facing', 'moment', 'then', 'course', 'was', 'fighting', 'Not', 'typical', 'barroom', 'see', 'westerns', 'fighting', 'moves', 'kicks', 'throws', 'punches', 'chops', 'One', 'best', 'parts', 'show', 'was', 'seeing', 'how', 'rough', 'tough', 'cowboys', 'reacted', 'started', 'fighting', 'skinny', 'Chinaman', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'could', 'punch', 'way', 'wet', 'paper', 'sack', 'only', 'find', 'ground', 'wondering', 'what', 'just', 'hit', 'them.In', 'addition', 'Carradine', 'other', 'stars', 'show', 'included', 'Philip', 'Ahn', 'Master', 'Khan', 'Keye', 'Luke', 'Master', 'Po', 'Radames', 'Pera', 'as', 'Caine', 'young', 'boy', 'Grasshopper', 'show', 'usually', 'attacted', 'great', 'guest', 'star', 'appearences', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'Gregory', 'Sierra', 'Roscoe', 'Lee', 'Browne', 'Gary', 'Bussy', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'very', 'young', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'are', 'coarse', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'need', 'recommend', 'get', 'box', 'set', 'season', '1', 'season', '2', '3', 'matter', 'may', 'already', 'have', 'planning', 'getting', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'series', 'where', 'too', 'young', 'time', 'watch', 'when', 'was', 'then', 'consider', 'getting', 'Especially', 'love', 'TV', 'show', 'not', 'anything', 'else', 'television', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'been', 'remastered', 'going', 'tape', 'disc', 'have', 'complaints', 'Also', 'read', 'couple', 'reviews', 'where', 'reviewer', 'said', 'pictures', 'had', 'been', 'cropped', 'widescreen', 'Why', 'anyone', 'would', 'do', 'something', 'was', 'specifically', 'made', 'television', 'sence', 'can', 'say', 'copy', 'season', '1', 'normal', 'screen', 'format', 'sound', 'are', 'going', 'purchase', 'copy', 'season', '1', 'will', 'want', 'make', 'sure', 'how', 'picture', 'been', 'formatted.Season', '1', 'short', 'compaired', 'other', 'two', 'seasons', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'only', '15', 'episodes', 'include', 'pilot', 'movie', 'helped', 'get', 'series', 'started', 'more', 'reason', 'get', 'DVD', 'help', 'see', 'movie', 'know', 'more', 'Caine', 'events', 'led', 'become', 'student', 'temple', 'why', 'had', 'leave', 'China', 'come', 'America']",N/A

What they did in Kung Fu was like if they cast Tom Cruise in ""Roots"" in the role as Kunta Kinte and painted his face black. Do you think that's ok? But no you say, it doesn't matter WHO's actually cast in the role ONLY that the story of Roots was so wonderful and educational. Or would it be more palatable if I practiced revisionist history and said that Kunta Kinte was half Caucasian and that's why we're going to cast Tom Cruise in the role? Anyway you choose to downplay what they did with the show is inexcusable. No, there were no half Caucasian, half Chinese Shaolin Monks at ANYTIME in the history of the temple and any attempts to change history just so they can cast a Caucasian actor in the role that should have gone to an Asian person is plain racist. Just like if Roots' producers attempted to cast Tom Cruise in the Kunta role and say that he's half Caucasian. And don't use the old standby excuse of ,""oh, there weren't any Asian actors around."" How did you think they filled the Sulu role on Star Trek? They didn't go to Japan for him. Asian actors from that period will tell you that no one wanted to cast them- racism.Hey, since you guys are so easy going I have a screenplay that I would like you to evaluate for a possible movie. It's a movie about George Washington. We're going to cast within the historical context BUT for the role of George Washington we're going to cast Chow Yun Fat. We'll cast him because other actors like Tom Hanks, or Cruise are very busy with other parts and expensive too. We'll just say that George Washington was actually from the far east and he helped Americans win the revolution and our forefathers were so thankful for all that he did that they decided to overlook his race and elect him our first president.  Yes, this will be a drama and we'll try to make it as authentic of a period piece as possible AND we'll add many anecdotes about life....so what do you guys think?Look, if you can't recognize that it's racism then you don't know the definition of the word.

It is a real pleasure to be able to watch these episodes in order, with spectacular color and sound. I can't wait for the remaining seasons (and hopefully the inferior but still entertaining &quot;Kung Fu - The Legend Continues&quot;) to come out!So why only a 4? Several reasons: (1) I hate double-sided DVD's. Warner seems especially prone to this cost-cutting tactic. Really, just an annoyance. (2) The widescreen cropping - until I read about it I didn't really notice the &quot;missing&quot; picture, though now that I'm looking for it, it's a little bit more noticeable. Again, this is just an annoyance for me. (3) the occasional pops and scratches - I would have thought they could be eliminated during the re-mastering. You guessed it, no more than an annoyance.Yes, there are many aspects of this show that are dated (it is from the 70's after all! Amazingly, this show stands the test of time far better than many other series from that time period, possibly because of its setting and message.) Yes, there is blatant racism and stereotyping in some of the casting (yet the show also addresses racism in many episodes.) Yes, the martial arts are mediocre at best until Kam Yuen is brought in as kung fu advisor. Yes, Bruce Lee was passed over in favor of a Caucasian (and the show would have been radically different had he not been, and not necessarily in a positive way.) All of these points are true, but this is still one of the first shows that used martial arts in a positive light (non-revenge oriented) and which along with Bruce Lee helped bring martial arts into mainstream American culture.If you enjoyed this show as much as I did, and aren't horribly offended (as some are) by the cropping - buy this set.

I watched the pilot episode of Kung-Fu, and the mixture of fighting and philosophy was food for an 11 year old seeker.Kung-Fu is the story of how a Shaolin priest comes to be in the post-Civil War American west. David Carradine plays Kwai Chang Caine who is the son of an American and a Chinese woman. Both die leaving the young Caine to be taken in by the Shaolin monks who raise the young boy teaching him the ways of the mind and body, philosophy and fighting. On the way to a celebration with one of his masters the adult Caine kills the nephew of the Emperor (after he kills the master). Caine then flees China for America not only to flee the death sentence he received in China but also a search to find his one living brother Daniel Caine. This search takes him through the American west where he finds American culture and customs as exotic as they find him. As cultures clash Caine and prejudices flourish Caine finds himself calling upon all the lessons taught him by his Shaolin teachers not in only in living a just life, through the extensive use of flashbacks we witness the training the young Caine undergoes and how the philosophy relates to the circumstnaces Caine finds himself in.I got this collection when it first came out and I sat watching all the episodes reliving the nostalgia of being in that basement again. I was amazed at the quality of the shows they look as good (or better) as they did when they first aired on TV. The story lines also held up, they tried for the universal in the themes, for instance the episode ""Chains"" is a variation on the movie The Defiant Ones. And the show is also laced with special guest stars including Jodie Foster, John Carradine (star David Carradine's father), Dana Elcar, Albert Salmi and a host of others that if you watched TV in the 70's you'll recognize. With the recent death of David Carradine I once again took the DVD's out and watched the episodes and discovered that this show and it's star played an influential role in my life, and they still have the power to influence, if you let them.",5,Strange Treasures These Episodes,1244592000,"06 10, 2009",2009,2343,"['basement', 'parents', 'house', 'Thursday', 'night', '1972', 'was', 'flipping', 'TV', 'channels', 'when', 'sunburst', 'appeared', 'screen', 'vaguely', 'Oriental', 'sounding', 'music', 'boomed', 'TV', 'far', 'figure', 'man', 'trudged', 'sand', 'dune', 'desert', 'watched', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Kung-Fu', 'mixture', 'fighting', 'philosophy', 'was', 'food', '11', 'year', 'old', 'seeker.Kung-Fu', 'story', 'how', 'Shaolin', 'priest', 'be', 'post-Civil', 'War', 'American', 'west', 'David', 'Carradine', 'Kwai', 'Chang', 'Caine', 'who', 'son', 'American', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'die', 'leaving', 'young', 'Caine', 'be', 'taken', 'Shaolin', 'monks', 'who', 'raise', 'young', 'boy', 'teaching', 'ways', 'mind', 'body', 'philosophy', 'fighting', 'way', 'celebration', 'one', 'masters', 'adult', 'Caine', 'nephew', 'Emperor', 'master', 'Caine', 'then', 'China', 'America', 'not', 'only', 'flee', 'death', 'sentence', 'received', 'China', 'also', 'search', 'find', 'one', 'living', 'brother', 'Daniel', 'Caine', 'search', 'American', 'west', 'where', 'American', 'culture', 'customs', 'as', 'exotic', 'find', 'cultures', 'clash', 'Caine', 'prejudices', 'flourish', 'Caine', 'calling', 'lessons', 'taught', 'Shaolin', 'teachers', 'not', 'only', 'living', 'just', 'life', 'extensive', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'witness', 'training', 'young', 'Caine', 'undergoes', 'how', 'philosophy', 'circumstnaces', 'Caine', 'in.I', 'got', 'collection', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'sat', 'watching', 'episodes', 'reliving', 'nostalgia', 'being', 'basement', 'again', 'was', 'amazed', 'quality', 'shows', 'look', 'good', 'better', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'TV', 'story', 'lines', 'also', 'held', 'up', 'tried', 'universal', 'themes', 'instance', 'episode', 'Chains', 'variation', 'movie', 'Defiant', 'Ones', 'show', 'also', 'laced', 'special', 'guest', 'stars', 'including', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'John', 'Carradine', 'star', 'David', 'Carradine', 'father', 'Dana', 'Elcar', 'Albert', 'Salmi', 'host', 'others', 'watched', 'TV', '70', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'recent', 'death', 'David', 'Carradine', 'once', 'again', 'took', 'DVD', 'out', 'watched', 'episodes', 'discovered', 'show', 'star', 'played', 'influential', 'role', 'life', 'still', 'have', 'power', 'influence', 'let']",N/A

As an added bonus, the pilot movie is thrown in with two documentaries (really, they look like one and probably should be).  While the documentaries are good enough to hold one's interests, they are quite standard fair.  The pilot movie, is like most pilots, establishing a backdrop for a series.And that is what really makes this set special: the 15 episodes.  As a kids, I never really liked this show much.  After all, I wanted action, but maturity set in and now I find the action for this show fits the time period and the softer wisdom philosophy of Kwai Chang Cain.  It is amazing, how the writers, without selling out Eastern philosophy, nicely interweave Eastern and Western ideas into the hour lessons.  Kung Fu is a movie that teaches and entertains.The fight scenes are well, average at best. But David Carradine, and actor/dancer was hired for the dramatic elements, and for lack of martial training, pulls off the character in spite of poor martial skills.  Still, the scenes are enjoyable because the plot is well scripted and directed and therefore, when Cain fights, which involves a purpose completely understood whether displayed visually or through audio message, one ends up enjoying the fights of this show.Certain episodes which would spark much debate today are  ""eye for an eye"" because of an overtly pro-life position ""Sun and Cloud Shadow"" because it was probably polemic then, but quite accepted now. These episodes are actually marvelous as well as ""Nine Lives"" which is light hearted with a good message and ""Dark Angel,"" a show about redemption, greed, and hope.  Dark Angel provides a powerful performance from Dean Jagger.The problems with the DVD are the cropping, which others have noted here and well, lets face it, Carradine is not a great martial artists or very Chinese looking.  Even though the producers in the documentary explain why he was hired, this weakness still presents a problem.  It must be noted that, this is also a strength for the show, for Carradine does deliver the lines wonderfully despite lacking martial and Chinese physical characteristics.Look for: Jodie Foster, Robert Urich, Gary Busy, John Saxon, and many many more actors who have in one way or another left their mark.",4,A Great DVD Despite Editing Problems - Kung Fu Rules!,1080604800,"03 30, 2004",2004,2344,"['classic', 'TV', 'series', 'resuscitated', 'new', 'season', '1', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'collectors', 'edition', 'boxed', 'set', 'added', 'bonus', 'pilot', 'movie', 'thrown', 'two', 'documentaries', 'really', 'look', 'one', 'probably', 'should', 'be', 'documentaries', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'hold', 'one', 'interests', 'are', 'quite', 'standard', 'fair', 'pilot', 'movie', 'most', 'pilots', 'establishing', 'backdrop', 'series.And', 'what', 'really', 'set', 'special', '15', 'episodes', 'kids', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'show', 'much', 'wanted', 'action', 'maturity', 'set', 'now', 'find', 'action', 'show', 'time', 'period', 'softer', 'wisdom', 'philosophy', 'Kwai', 'Chang', 'Cain', 'amazing', 'how', 'writers', 'selling', 'out', 'Eastern', 'philosophy', 'nicely', 'interweave', 'Eastern', 'Western', 'ideas', 'hour', 'lessons', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'movie', 'teaches', 'entertains.The', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'average', 'best', 'David', 'Carradine', 'actor/dancer', 'was', 'hired', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'lack', 'martial', 'training', 'character', 'spite', 'poor', 'martial', 'skills', 'Still', 'scenes', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'plot', 'well', 'scripted', 'directed', 'therefore', 'when', 'Cain', 'fights', 'purpose', 'completely', 'understood', 'displayed', 'visually', 'audio', 'message', 'one', 'up', 'enjoying', 'fights', 'show.Certain', 'would', 'spark', 'much', 'debate', 'today', 'are', 'eye', 'eye', 'overtly', 'pro-life', 'position', 'Sun', 'Cloud', 'Shadow', 'was', 'probably', 'polemic', 'then', 'quite', 'accepted', 'now', 'episodes', 'are', 'actually', 'marvelous', 'as', 'well', 'Nine', 'Lives', 'light', 'hearted', 'good', 'message', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'show', 'redemption', 'greed', 'hope', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Dean', 'Jagger.The', 'problems', 'DVD', 'are', 'cropping', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'here', 'well', 'face', 'Carradine', 'not', 'great', 'martial', 'artists', 'very', 'Chinese', 'looking', 'Even', 'producers', 'documentary', 'explain', 'why', 'was', 'hired', 'weakness', 'still', 'problem', 'must', 'be', 'noted', 'also', 'strength', 'show', 'Carradine', 'deliver', 'lines', 'wonderfully', 'lacking', 'martial', 'Chinese', 'physical', 'characteristics.Look', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Robert', 'Urich', 'Gary', 'Busy', 'John', 'Saxon', 'many', 'many', 'more', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'one', 'way', 'left', 'mark']",N/A

I agree that this is wrong, and should not have been done. But it does not affect how good the stories are and that this is still a great series.2) People who are Bruce Lee fans and think Bruce Lee should have played the main character.

And the screen also seems to have been cropped too. But overall, I guess it's better to have them in this format and versions than not at all. But that's why the three star rating.A brief comment on the martial arts, since I am a teacher of kung fu and also karate. A judo instructor, oddly enough, was the first expert engaged to advise on the martial arts for the show. At some point, someone apparently said shouldn't we get a kung fu expert since that's what the show is about? And so they retained Los Angeles sifu Kam Yuen, a master of the very interesting tai mantis style of kung fu, which is an offshoot of the original northern praying mantis style and considered a very sophisticated system.There are actually dozens of different praying mantis styles at this point, including six harmonies mantis, plum flower mantis, shiny board mantis, 7 star praying mantis, and southern mantis, although the latter probably isn't a true praying mantis sytem.So it was interesting that a master of one of the rarer kung fu styles in this country was chosen, rather than something more common such as Wing Chun, Hung Gar, Choy Li Fut, or 7 Star Praying mantis, all of which are more common styles. But whatever style was chosen, the show introduced millions of people to kung fu in a way that was technically accurate and faithful to the original style.",3,Some background notes,1134172800,"12 10, 2005",2005,1532,"['previous', 'reviewer', 'have', 'problem', 'episodes', 'having', 'been', 'shortened', 'few', 'minutes', 'make', 'room', 'more', 'commercials', 'story', 'choppier', 'screen', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'cropped', 'too', 'overall', 'guess', 'better', 'have', 'format', 'versions', 'not', 'why', 'three', 'star', 'rating.A', 'brief', 'comment', 'martial', 'arts', 'am', 'teacher', 'kung', 'fu', 'also', 'karate', 'judo', 'instructor', 'oddly', 'enough', 'was', 'first', 'expert', 'engaged', 'advise', 'martial', 'arts', 'show', 'point', 'someone', 'apparently', 'said', 'should', ""n't"", 'get', 'kung', 'fu', 'expert', 'what', 'show', 'so', 'retained', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'sifu', 'Kam', 'Yuen', 'master', 'very', 'interesting', 'tai', 'mantis', 'style', 'kung', 'fu', 'offshoot', 'original', 'northern', 'praying', 'mantis', 'style', 'considered', 'very', 'sophisticated', 'system.There', 'are', 'actually', 'dozens', 'different', 'praying', 'mantis', 'styles', 'point', 'including', 'six', 'harmonies', 'mantis', 'plum', 'flower', 'mantis', 'shiny', 'board', 'mantis', '7', 'star', 'praying', 'mantis', 'southern', 'mantis', 'latter', 'probably', ""n't"", 'true', 'praying', 'mantis', 'sytem.So', 'was', 'interesting', 'master', 'one', 'rarer', 'kung', 'fu', 'styles', 'country', 'was', 'chosen', 'rather', 'something', 'more', 'common', 'such', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'Hung', 'Gar', 'Choy', 'Li', 'Fut', '7', 'Star', 'Praying', 'mantis', 'are', 'more', 'common', 'styles', 'style', 'was', 'chosen', 'show', 'introduced', 'millions', 'people', 'kung', 'fu', 'way', 'was', 'technically', 'accurate', 'faithful', 'original', 'style']",N/A

792246,A1FC39ADY163L,B00013F38K,Robert Payne,"[7, 11]","What good things can I say about the television series ""Kung Fu"" (1972-75) that haven't already been said?  More than 30 years after the original TV show left the airwaves, it remains my favorite American network series.  Not only were ""Kung Fu's"" writing and acting all superlative, but its highly unusual, Zen-like take on the all-American genre of the Western -- in case you don't know, the show is about a Buddhist monk roaming the Wild West -- still resonates.  For my money, the first-season episode titled ""An Eye for an Eye"" remains the finest thing that American episodic TV has ever created.  Here is the best way for me to sum up how much I love ""Kung Fu"": of all the decorations in my home, only one is a photo of a celebrity -- an autographed picture of David Carradine as Kwai-Chang Caine.Now that you know how highly I regard ""Kung Fu,"" I would still like to make a few comments about it.  As much as I respect the series for popularizing the Asian presence in U.S. history at a time when hardly anyone else was doing so, the series did cut a few corners, and this bugs me a bit.ACTING: ""Kung Fu's"" weakest link is Radames Pera as the young Kwai-Chang (a.k.a. ""Grasshopper"") in the famous flashbacks.  While the performances by the cast and guest stars are usually excellent, Pera's recitation of his lines totally lacks any convincing emotional undercurrent.  Also, he doesn't look very much like Carradine, who plays the character that he's supposed to grow up to be.  I have a hard time believing that Pera was the best choice for this part.ETHNIC ISSUES: The country of China, the setting for the show's flashbacks, is a patchwork quilt of various ethnicities.  However, the country's dominant ethnic group is the Han people, the first folks we Westerners tend to think of as ""Chinese,"" while the others, such as the Uygurs and the Tibetans, are considered ""minorities.""  In ""Kung Fu's"" pilot, when Master Kan (Philip Ahn) tells young half-white Caine that the Shaolin monastery has never accepted anyone other than of ""full-Chinese birth,"" I take him to mean anything other than full-Han ancestry.  My response to this is: ""Why, then, does Master Kan have a Mongolian name?""  It's a small point, to be sure, but one that could have been avoided.  (For my thoughts on Carradine, a Caucasian actor, playing the half-Chinese Caine, see my Amazon review of ""Kung Fu's"" second season.)ACTION: The element of ""Kung Fu"" that dates the poorest is its fight scenes.  Prior to the series, Western popular culture was not greatly exposed to Asian martial arts.  One of the few exceptions was Bruce Lee's high-kicking acrobatics on another TV show, ""The Green Hornet"" (1966-67), but this did not have an immediate impact upon large American audiences.  So, ""Kung Fu's"" slow-motion fight scenes were quite innovative for their time, and I remember being thrilled by them when the show first aired.  To speculate, it may have been because of ""Kung Fu's"" popularity that American movie screens soon made room for martial-arts films from Asia, especially those from Hong Kong, such as ""Five Fingers of Death"" and Bruce Lee's starring vehicles.  Once American audiences got a taste of them, however, their dynamism made ""Kung Fu's"" heavily stylized fighting less satisfying.  In fact, compared to the unarmed-combat movies from Hong Kong, ""Kung Fu's"" slow-motion fights come off primarily as a means to cover up Carradine's lack of mastery in the martial arts.  Still, this isn't enough to wreck the series for me.HAIR: This is the show's flaw that really bothers me the most: the hairstyles of the Chinese men.  From 1644 to 1912 (which includes the years when ""Kung Fu"" is set), the Qing Dynasty required men (but not women) in China to wear their hair in queues.  This meant not only wearing a ponytail, but shaving the area around the crown and temples of one's head as well.  The Qing Dynasty, which had conquered China from Manchuria, compelled the Han men to adopt this Manchurian hairstyle as a symbol of native-Chinese subservience to their new rulers.  Those men that refused to wear the queue were summarily executed, giving rise to the saying, ""Lose your hair and keep your head; otherwise, keep your hair and lose your head.""  The only adult Chinese males who did not wear queues were Buddhist monks, who, as ""Kung Fu"" more accurately depicts, shaved their heads entirely.Chinese men in America were not exempt from this decree.  Until 1952, racist laws in the U.S. prohibited Asian-born immigrants (most of whom were men) from becoming naturalized citizens.  Therefore, even on American soil, 19th-century Chinese men, who theoretically could be deported back to their native country at any time, were obliged to follow this Qing Dynasty law.Unfortunately, ""Kung Fu"" does not deal accurately with Chinese men's tonsorial traditions in the 19th century: most of the series' Chinese men wear contemporary 20th-century hairstyles.  If a queue is present at all, it's usually just a braided ponytail attached to a contemporary coif.  The one time the subject of queues comes up on ""Kung Fu"" (the third season's ""This Valley of Fear""), Caine says that wearing one is only ""a personal choice.""  Regrettably, the moment is a missed opportunity to educate the audience about the significance of Qing-era hairstyles.So, every Chinese man in ""Kung Fu"" not wearing a queue, and who is not a Shaolin monk, does not have an authentic period hairstyle.  However, I'm not saying that Carradine ought to have worn a queue.  In fact, knowing about 19th-century Chinese hairstyles makes me appreciate his shoulder-length mane all the more: it instantly marks Caine as an outlaw. Still, the unusualness of his hairstyle on a Chinese man of the Qing era should have immediately signaled something amiss to the show's other characters.  For example, the Chinese railroad crew in the pilot would have remarked about his grown-out shaved head before they noticed the Shaolin marks on his arms.  The crew cut on the Chinese dissident Wong Ti Lu (Mako) in the first season's ""The Tide"" also makes sense as a political statement of someone opposed to the Qing emperor.  Otherwise, the 20th-century hairstyles on the show's other Chinese men are a nagging reminder not only of a historical inaccuracy, but also of a thematically rich element ignored by the series.  Would it have been so uneconomical for ""Kung Fu"" to have put its non-Shaolin Chinese male characters in bald wigs with queues attached to them?Still, I hope that none of my comments about ""Kung Fu"" discourages anyone interested in the show from checking out the DVD.  After all, the reason I know as much about Chinese history as I do is because ""Kung Fu"" made such an enormous impact on me.  I'm glad that the series continues to move audiences today.(Note: I have also written reviews for the second and third seasons of ""Kung Fu."")",5,"Pt. 1: Yes, It's a Great Show,

Although care appears to have been taken to make this look natural, if you compare this version to the full-screen version, you notice things like Caine's hat missing its top.

If this is all that will be made available, then I still recommend buying this set, because the show is incredible, and this is the first time some of these episodes have ever been offered on video (VHS or DVD).

792253,A3NFT0DBLKFYST,B00013F38K,"Tim R. Niles ""Nomad""","[5, 7]","""Kung Fu"" is one of the best television Westerns ever done. I was 22 when the series started in 1972, just at the best age to appreciate the amazing confluence of Eastern ideas placed into a wild Western setting.However, after viewing this series - the second season - on DVD, the force of it is even more obvious.Now, I am in agreement with those who condemn the aspect ratio editing; a TV show - unless filmed originally in widescreen should be shown in the stand TV 'full screen' format. However, the DVD sets are better than nothing at all.I also agree that Bruce Lee was ill treated by the producers of ""Kung Fu."" However, Bruce Lee died in the summer of 1973! And how did he die? A film star known the world over, whose films are still regarded as seminal within the genre. Besides, as one who has mingled in the Hollywood (of the late 70s, when things changed to an extent) milieu, writers, actors, directors, et al, get cheated and ignored all the time. Sure, race can be part of the theft or mistreatment, but ""Hollywood""  is a cut throat place all too often, where there is no 'rule book' on anything. So, would the critics of the alleged racism and mistreatment of Bruce Lee rather have had him do only the first season of ""Kung Fu"" before he died, or become the world renowned martial artist whose legend has endured for over three decades after his death? The answer is obvious! They didn't kill him, they made him a legend! There are just too many moral lepers with too much power in ""Hollywood"", and yet, there are also people like Spielberg, Paul Newman, the Reiners, Ron Howard, who are as close to solid gold as it gets in this life. ""Hollywood"" is just not the place to go expecting justice; the whole film and television industry is based on relatively temporary general popularity, not the ethical treatment of those involved in making the 'product.' A lot of the decisions that are made have strong social components - people who have worked together on other efforts - rather than just artistic perspectives in common. Anything from ""Hollywood"" is a collaborative effort of people whose careers live and die on the whims of the general public... and it makes everyone involved skittish or edgy and often cynical. Too much is out of control, so they tend to go with what seems safe (for them) or what the 'execs' or the bag men (follow the money trail) require. The people in ""Hollywood"" know how unstable their work is and they expect others to know that as well. It's quicksand.That ""Hollywood"" could have produced such a fine series as ""Kung Fu"" deserves praise, not condemnation over the fate of Bruce Lee in a TV series.Now, to anyone with martial arts training, the first season in particular was almost amusing because so much of the martial arts had to be supported by slowing down the camera speed and using unusual angles to hide the inabilities of David Carradine. Over the course of the three years, Carradine did improve greatly, though he was never going to be in the same class as Lee.Carradine was the perfect choice, martial arts skills aside, to convey the message of the creators of ""Kung Fu.""

The episodes look like they were shot on film yesterday. It has true 16:9 ratio, so we are seeing more than when it first aired. At least it seems this way to me.

The wisdom, while clear, was subtle (unlike the 2nd series, where it was done to impress - look at me, I'm saying something you don't understand), the flashbacks were well intergrated, and the stories were just plain great.2 stars for the DVD:  OK, the color was much improved upon over the tape.  Unfortuanately it goes downhill fast from there.  Artifacts and scratches were not removed.  And, after a frame by frame comparison (see above details), it was clearly choped.  What's worse, is that there was no effort made to scan up or down when needed.There are many times when they could have made the cut completely off the bottom, without affecting the scene at all.  Yet instead, they decided to just cut off the same distance from top and bottom, and cut off a piece of someone's head!?All that said, the series was good enough, and the price cheap enough, that I'll probably buy the next two seasons when they come out.",3,tape to DVD - frame by frame comparison - choped,1079481600,"03 17, 2004",2004,1273,"['own', 'tape', 'version', 'pilot', 'movie', 'did', 'frame', 'frame', 'comparison', 'first', 'frame', 'when', 'scenes', 'change', 'was', 'how', 'marked', 'frames', 'Unquestionably', 'choped', 'top', 'bottom', 'indiscriminately', 'too', 'NOTHING', 'extra', 'sides.4', 'stars', 'series', 'fact', 'fighting', 'looked', 'was', 'choreographed', '3rd', 'graders', 'wisdom', 'clear', 'was', 'subtle', '2nd', 'series', 'where', 'was', 'done', 'impress', 'look', ""'m"", 'saying', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'flashbacks', 'were', 'well', 'intergrated', 'stories', 'were', 'just', 'plain', 'great.2', 'stars', 'DVD', 'OK', 'color', 'was', 'much', 'improved', 'tape', 'downhill', 'fast', 'there', 'Artifacts', 'scratches', 'were', 'not', 'removed', 'frame', 'frame', 'comparison', 'see', 'details', 'was', 'clearly', 'choped', 'What', 'worse', 'was', 'effort', 'made', 'scan', 'up', 'down', 'when', 'are', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'cut', 'completely', 'bottom', 'affecting', 'scene', 'instead', 'decided', 'just', 'cut', 'off', 'same', 'distance', 'top', 'bottom', 'cut', 'off', 'piece', 'someone', 'head', 'said', 'series', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'price', 'cheap', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'buy', 'next', 'two', 'seasons', 'when', 'come', 'out']",N/A

What about the quality and direction of the entire season? What about the fact that there is NO OTHER WAY to have this series on DVD expect like this? Yeah, what about it?The transfer here is retina searing. It is hard to believe this was filmed 30+ years ago, looks more like yesterday's dailies. The sound is rather disappointing in light of the extreme care that went in to the video transfer; it is still lagging back in the 70's even though we all have 5.1 sound systems and the fact that if a series as old as the original Star Trek can be upgraded to 5.1dd, what about this? I should mention that the packaging is well constructed and... is beautiful.I think the most valuable aspect of this series is what all great series have/had; the ability to cast GREAT guest stars EVERY week. We all know Carradine is great, just as we know Peter Falk as Columbo is great, what sets this show and shows like Columbo apart from typical and forgettable 70's TV drek is the entire SHOW is good not just the leads. That to me is crucial, and Kung Fu excels in spades. The only small niggle I have is the fact that the child that played Caine in the flashbacks really looks NOTHING like him and they should have strived for at least someone who looked moderately HALF Chinese, hell I would settled for a quarter.I found this show by checking it out through ""Netflix"" as I LOVE old TV but was only 4 when this hit the TV screen. Not wanting to BUY it only to feel as though it wasn't that great I highly recommend that venue.
