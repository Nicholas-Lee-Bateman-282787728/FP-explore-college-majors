I stopped watching the show after that, and soon after it was cancelled. I was recently watching some episodes and now i wander why i even watched this show. It is so corny and lame. The acting is alright, could be better. The clothing is blinding to look at. It just reminds me of other shows that now just don't stand the test of time, for example Melrose Place and Beverly Hills 90210.There is no way i would ever get any of these series on DVD. I would consider the earlier seasons of Beverly Hills 90210, because i can still watch them and not think, ""oh come on, that is so stupid"". That's what i think when i watch Melrose Place reruns or Silk Stalkings. It's just not as great as you remembered.",3,Does not stand the test of time,1258070400,"11 13, 2009",2009,812,"['When', 'show', 'was', 'air', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'hated', 'when', 'killed', 'off', 'Chris', 'then', 'Rita', 'left', 'stopped', 'watching', 'show', 'soon', 'was', 'cancelled', 'was', 'recently', 'watching', 'episodes', 'now', 'i', 'wander', 'why', 'i', 'even', 'watched', 'show', 'so', 'corny', 'lame', 'acting', 'alright', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'clothing', 'blinding', 'look', 'just', 'other', 'shows', 'now', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'example', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210.There', 'way', 'i', 'would', 'ever', 'get', 'series', 'DVD', 'would', 'consider', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'i', 'can', 'still', 'watch', 'not', 'think', 'oh', 'come', 'so', 'stupid', 'what', 'i', 'think', 'when', 'i', 'watch', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'Silk', 'Stalkings', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'remembered']",Silk Stalkings - The Complete Fifth Season
998841,A1L1NJNVL5ICZB,B000G5SIEY,"Cloudburst2000 ""OasisRocks""","[18, 19]","I was so thankful that this season finally came out on DVD.  The first twelve episodes of the season were some of the best the series ever had to offer.  I bought the season five DVDs strictly for those first twelve episodes that show how Rita and Chris finally surrendered to their passion and love for each other.  The trials and uncertainty they went through about how to make their romantic relationship work with professional one always kept me glued to the screen.  The only reason this series of DVDs gets a 4/5 is because I don't have a vested interest in the second half of the season.  The two cops who replaced Chris and Rita mid-season were okay, but they just couldn't capture the same kind of magic that Chris and Rita had.  They just didn't have the vibe that kept you tuning back in for more.  But the season is well-worth the money for the first twelve episodes alone...at least, for any Chris and Rita lovers.  Also, another negative of the DVD set is they have the wrong episodes listed on the cover.  The episodes ARE season five episodes.  Don't panic.  However, the episode guide included with the set is the season four episode guide.  Hopefully, that is a glitch that the company will correct once they are informed of the error.  I went on-line and downloaded an episode guide for the fifth season to include with the DVDs.  The first twelve episodes are Chris and Rita dealing with their burgeoning realtionship and Chris' eventual death protecting Rita and their unborn child.  The rest of the episodes include the new duo.  All in all, I'm happy with my purchase.",4,Great first 12 season episodes...,1157673600,"09 8, 2006",2006,1591,"['was', 'so', 'thankful', 'season', 'finally', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'first', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'season', 'were', 'best', 'series', 'ever', 'had', 'offer', 'bought', 'season', 'five', 'DVDs', 'strictly', 'first', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'show', 'how', 'Rita', 'Chris', 'finally', 'surrendered', 'passion', 'love', 'other', 'trials', 'uncertainty', 'went', 'how', 'make', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'work', 'professional', 'one', 'always', 'kept', 'glued', 'screen', 'only', 'reason', 'series', 'DVDs', '4/5', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'vested', 'interest', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'two', 'cops', 'who', 'replaced', 'Chris', 'Rita', 'mid-season', 'were', 'okay', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'capture', 'same', 'kind', 'magic', 'Chris', 'Rita', 'had', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'vibe', 'kept', 'tuning', 'back', 'more', 'season', 'well-worth', 'money', 'first', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'alone', 'least', 'Chris', 'Rita', 'lovers', 'Also', 'negative', 'DVD', 'set', 'have', 'wrong', 'episodes', 'listed', 'cover', 'episodes', 'ARE', 'season', 'five', 'episodes', 'Do', ""n't"", 'panic', 'However', 'episode', 'guide', 'included', 'set', 'season', 'four', 'episode', 'guide', 'Hopefully', 'glitch', 'company', 'will', 'correct', 'once', 'are', 'informed', 'error', 'went', 'on-line', 'downloaded', 'episode', 'guide', 'fifth', 'season', 'include', 'DVDs', 'first', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'are', 'Chris', 'Rita', 'dealing', 'burgeoning', 'realtionship', 'Chris', 'eventual', 'death', 'protecting', 'Rita', 'unborn', 'child', 'rest', 'episodes', 'include', 'new', 'duo', ""'m"", 'happy', 'purchase']",Silk Stalkings - The Complete Fifth Season
