E4's fine TV show centering around the lives of various teenagers as they go through... er... life. There's the smart ones, the pretty ones, the gay ones, the sluts, the virgins, the brains, etc. In the first generation there were some excellent characters and some deep, intelligent stories. Now we have here the debut series for the second generation of the series and something is just a bit off.It's hard to say exactly what the problem is. I know part of it is that there's no one with the charm of Sid or the chemistry between him and Tony. Most of the leads seem very self-centered and one-dimensional. Some of them, like JJ, are pretty neat and fun to spend time with, but others just aren't. Effy is annoying, Freddy is too emo to live (as it were), Naomi is basically just there but doesn't do much. Basically the cast just isn't as interesting as they were in the first two series.But that's not to say that this a bad set of stories. It's quite good, actually. You do get quite a lot of angst and lots of times when you want to throttle everyone on screen, and it's definitely not as deep as the first two series, but it does have its charms and some moments of real humor and emotion.Overall it's still something I'd recommend, because even if it's not as good as the first two series, it's still better than much of what's out there.",4,"Still very good, but something is missing...",1276819200,"06 18, 2010",2010,1360,"['Ah', 'Skins', 'E4', 'fine', 'TV', 'show', 'centering', 'lives', 'various', 'teenagers', 'go', 'er', 'life', 'smart', 'ones', 'pretty', 'ones', 'gay', 'ones', 'sluts', 'virgins', 'brains', 'etc', 'first', 'generation', 'were', 'excellent', 'characters', 'deep', 'intelligent', 'stories', 'Now', 'have', 'here', 'debut', 'series', 'second', 'generation', 'series', 'something', 'just', 'bit', 'off.It', 'hard', 'say', 'exactly', 'what', 'problem', 'know', 'part', 'one', 'charm', 'Sid', 'chemistry', 'Tony', 'Most', 'leads', 'seem', 'very', 'self-centered', 'one-dimensional', 'JJ', 'are', 'pretty', 'neat', 'fun', 'spend', 'time', 'others', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'Effy', 'annoying', 'Freddy', 'too', 'emo', 'live', 'were', 'Naomi', 'basically', 'just', 'there', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'Basically', 'cast', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'interesting', 'were', 'first', 'two', 'series.But', 'not', 'say', 'bad', 'set', 'stories', 'quite', 'good', 'actually', 'do', 'get', 'quite', 'lot', 'angst', 'lots', 'times', 'when', 'want', 'throttle', 'everyone', 'screen', 'definitely', 'not', 'as', 'deep', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'have', 'charms', 'moments', 'real', 'humor', 'emotion.Overall', 'still', 'something', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'even', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'still', 'better', 'much', 'what', 'out', 'there']",N/A

This is a fantastic show but parents should be aware there is a lot of cursing and nudity.  I would recommend this show more for young adult age.  Very addictive.  If you enjoy this show, I would also recommend checking out the BBC show Misfits.FYI for those who have seen Seasons 1 and/or 2, the characters are entirely different.  Every 2 seasons they switch out all the characters for new ones.  Personally, I find Seasons 3 and 4 to be better than the original seasons 1 and 2 but both are worth watching and owning in my opinion.",5,Loved It,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,627,"['teen-drama', 'American', 'shows', 'shame', 'terms', 'how', 'far', ""'re"", 'willing', 'go', 'fantastic', 'show', 'parents', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'lot', 'cursing', 'nudity', 'would', 'recommend', 'show', 'more', 'young', 'adult', 'age', 'Very', 'addictive', 'enjoy', 'show', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'checking', 'BBC', 'show', 'Misfits.FYI', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Seasons', '1', 'and/or', '2', 'characters', 'are', 'entirely', 'different', '2', 'seasons', 'switch', 'characters', 'new', 'ones', 'Personally', 'find', 'Seasons', '3', '4', 'be', 'better', 'original', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'owning', 'opinion']",N/A
1338729,A2RX1WIH9OFC76,B003ES5JWE,Kevin Peshick,"[4, 6]","I was about to give up on the third season of Skins with all of its new characters. While I didn't want to prejudge based on my affinity for the characters in the first two seasons, my main reason for wanting to give up on it was because of the writers and directors complete dependence on flatulence and regurgitation. I got so tired of watching people throw up on screen, and then combined with all of the fart jokes, I figured that the writers had nothing to offer so this was all they could do. But I stayed with it and they did start to explore the hidden complexity of the characters and it got better. Not great yet, but better. So, if you want to try this season out, don't miss the first two or three episodes, but don't be completely put off by the stupidity of them either.",3,Stick with it as it gets better.,1291248000,"12 2, 2010",2010,784,"['was', 'about', 'give', 'up', 'third', 'season', 'Skins', 'new', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'prejudge', 'based', 'affinity', 'characters', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'main', 'reason', 'wanting', 'give', 'up', 'was', 'writers', 'directors', 'complete', 'dependence', 'flatulence', 'regurgitation', 'got', 'so', 'tired', 'watching', 'people', 'throw', 'up', 'screen', 'then', 'combined', 'fart', 'jokes', 'figured', 'writers', 'had', 'nothing', 'offer', 'so', 'was', 'could', 'do', 'stayed', 'did', 'start', 'explore', 'hidden', 'complexity', 'characters', 'got', 'better', 'Not', 'great', 'yet', 'better', 'So', 'want', 'try', 'season', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'first', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'completely', 'put', 'off', 'stupidity']",N/A
1338730,A2RW17CTV291QD,B003ES5JWE,LILY,"[4, 7]","I stumbled across Skins even before it made it's way to the U.S. At first i was not sure how I felt about it but pretty soon I was hooked. I loved all the characters and it crept up on me. I would see that the next epsiode would be about Sid and think,""eh he's not my favorite,"" and so would not be really excited to see that episode but once I started to watch the actual episode I found myself, laughing, tearing up and pretty much engrossed in his story. First two seasons were beautiful and poignant. The characters were never what you thought they were even at the beginning of each episode as there was always a new layer to discover. When I found out that their journey ended at the end of Season 2, I literally had to take a break and process all that I saw. I actually cried at the end, something I rarely do with shows unless I truly love them.I gave Season three a three star rating solely becaise I love the first two and am now loyal. But the feeling I had in the first two seasons about not being completley into a character before I watched their episode continues to persist even after an epiosode finishes in this season. I am not sure why they chose Effy as the central character ( I guess she is the one link from the first two seasons). How many times can we see her annhilate herself before it gets old. She is not interesting to watch at all. Pandora just gets on my nerves with her big clumsy self. I keep thinking when are they going to stop dressing up Freddie in girl's clothes. If this was part of his identity it would be one thing,but the fact that he is wearing a shirt with no sleeves and really fem pants at the same time he is trying to get Effy just makes me laugh. The twins are boring and I am not sure what Naomi's role is.These characters do not mesh the way the others do and I find that I don't really care what happens to them. A part of me feels that I continue to watch in hopes that an old character makes a guest appearance and we get to see what happened to them.I grew up watching and loving Degrassi (both Junior High and Next Generation) and this is like the X rated version of them. However I wish this show would follow Degrassi in giving us a little bit more time with the original characters we grew to enjoy rather than every 2 years foisting a new group on us.",3,"Not as great as the first two seasons, but decent",1301529600,"03 31, 2011",2011,2315,"['stumbled', 'Skins', 'even', 'made', 'way', 'U.S.', 'first', 'i', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'felt', 'pretty', 'soon', 'was', 'hooked', 'loved', 'characters', 'crept', 'up', 'would', 'see', 'next', 'epsiode', 'would', 'be', 'Sid', 'think', 'not', 'favorite', 'so', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'really', 'excited', 'see', 'episode', 'once', 'started', 'watch', 'actual', 'episode', 'found', 'laughing', 'tearing', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'engrossed', 'story', 'First', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'beautiful', 'poignant', 'characters', 'were', 'never', 'what', 'thought', 'were', 'even', 'beginning', 'episode', 'was', 'always', 'new', 'layer', 'discover', 'When', 'found', 'out', 'journey', 'ended', 'end', 'Season', '2', 'literally', 'had', 'take', 'break', 'process', 'saw', 'actually', 'cried', 'end', 'something', 'rarely', 'do', 'shows', 'truly', 'love', 'them.I', 'gave', 'Season', 'three', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'solely', 'becaise', 'love', 'first', 'two', 'am', 'now', 'loyal', 'feeling', 'had', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'not', 'being', 'completley', 'character', 'watched', 'episode', 'persist', 'even', 'epiosode', 'finishes', 'season', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'chose', 'Effy', 'central', 'character', 'guess', 'one', 'link', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'see', 'annhilate', 'old', 'not', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Pandora', 'just', 'nerves', 'big', 'clumsy', 'self', 'keep', 'thinking', 'when', 'are', 'going', 'stop', 'dressing', 'up', 'Freddie', 'girl', 'clothes', 'was', 'part', 'identity', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'fact', 'wearing', 'shirt', 'sleeves', 'really', 'fem', 'pants', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'get', 'Effy', 'just', 'twins', 'are', 'boring', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Naomi', 'role', 'is.These', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'mesh', 'way', 'others', 'do', 'find', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'what', 'part', 'continue', 'watch', 'hopes', 'old', 'character', 'guest', 'appearance', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'them.I', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'loving', 'Degrassi', 'Junior', 'High', 'Next', 'Generation', 'X', 'rated', 'version', 'However', 'wish', 'show', 'would', 'follow', 'Degrassi', 'giving', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'original', 'characters', 'grew', 'enjoy', 'rather', '2', 'years', 'foisting', 'new', 'group']",N/A
