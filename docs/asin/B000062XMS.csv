692605,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B000062XMS,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[78, 80]","Based on the biography by George Weigel, this is an excellent overview of Pope John Paul II's life. Weigel is interviewed extensively, as well as many who knew John Paul II in Poland, in the church, and those on the world stage who interacted with him because of his enormous influence on international affairs, like former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski.The early years have a few reenactments, but are mostly shown with riveting archival footage, some of it from the horrors of the Nazi invasion of 1939, through WWII.Then as the Nazis left, the Soviets arrived, and there is a quote saying it felt like ""losing the same war twice"", as Stalin's fist of iron bore down on the Polish people.John Paul II was born in 1920 and had much tragedy as a child, losing his mother when he was 9, and his older brother three years later. Handsome and athletic (with looks that remind me of Lawrence Olivier), he was a poet and actor, worked in a quarry, and then joined an underground seminary. It is a life so full of important events, that this documentary moves fast to include them all.There is marvelous footage of his triumphant return to Poland as pope for the first time, which spread the seeds of freedom and the Solidarity Movement of the workers in Poland. Also covered are the assassination attempt, and how his views sometimes clashed with the ideology of the secular world.Written and directed by Judith Dwan Hallet, with narration by Rene Auberjonois, and music by Fred Karns, this is good way to quickly familiarize oneself with the life of this saintly man who was ""called to a greater love"".Total running time is 2 hours.",5,"""poet, philosopher, mystic, pope""",1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,1644,"['Based', 'biography', 'George', 'Weigel', 'excellent', 'overview', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'life', 'Weigel', 'interviewed', 'extensively', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'who', 'knew', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'Poland', 'church', 'world', 'stage', 'who', 'interacted', 'enormous', 'influence', 'international', 'affairs', 'former', 'National', 'Security', 'Advisor', 'Zbigniew', 'Brzezinski.The', 'early', 'years', 'have', 'few', 'reenactments', 'are', 'mostly', 'shown', 'riveting', 'archival', 'footage', 'horrors', 'Nazi', 'invasion', '1939', 'through', 'WWII.Then', 'Nazis', 'left', 'Soviets', 'arrived', 'quote', 'saying', 'felt', 'losing', 'same', 'war', 'twice', 'Stalin', 'fist', 'iron', 'bore', 'down', 'Polish', 'people.John', 'Paul', 'II', 'was', 'born', '1920', 'had', 'much', 'tragedy', 'child', 'losing', 'mother', 'when', 'was', '9', 'older', 'brother', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'Handsome', 'athletic', 'remind', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'was', 'poet', 'actor', 'worked', 'quarry', 'then', 'joined', 'underground', 'seminary', 'life', 'so', 'full', 'important', 'events', 'documentary', 'moves', 'fast', 'include', 'all.There', 'marvelous', 'footage', 'triumphant', 'return', 'Poland', 'pope', 'first', 'time', 'spread', 'seeds', 'freedom', 'Solidarity', 'Movement', 'workers', 'Poland', 'Also', 'covered', 'are', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'how', 'views', 'sometimes', 'clashed', 'ideology', 'secular', 'world.Written', 'directed', 'Judith', 'Dwan', 'Hallet', 'narration', 'Rene', 'Auberjonois', 'music', 'Fred', 'Karns', 'good', 'way', 'quickly', 'familiarize', 'life', 'saintly', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'called', 'greater', 'love', '.Total', 'running', 'time', '2', 'hours']",N/A

This movie covers his childhood, the loss of his mother, then how he and his father went on. His school years, his love of acting, sports and leadship qualities. The war came and he like everyone at that time, survived the best he could. The loss of his father, then his days as priest. His life as pope. You will live each moment with him. I laughed, cried and was awed and grateful for this holy man. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.

692622,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B000062XMS,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[1, 1]","The 2002 documentary film ""Witness to Hope,"" presented on this bare-bones DVD with only ""play"" and chapter stop features, is a remarkable accomplishment. Like George Weigel's source biography of the same name, it manages to be remarkably insightful about Karol Wojtyla's papacy, neither pulling its punches about acknowledging controversy nor simplistically idolizing him. Although produced by Catholics about a man who Pope Francis has now canonized as St. John Paul II, it interviews a wide variety of people from Polish political figures to Jimmy Carter's Polish-born national security advisor.Most surprising of all, the interviews are uniformly in English, with even the Polish interviewees speaking it flawlessly! The historical dramatizations are also tastefully done, visualizing key moments without overwhelming the film, and balancing the interview footage remarkably well. The film avoids the extremes of being overly talky in its interviews and overly hokey/melodramatic in its dramatizations. Weigel's incisive analysis lurks behind every frame, even though he appears himself in the interview footage only rarely, which is another sign of the video's quality in that it focuses squarely on JPII and not on his official American biographer.The film does a particularly nice job of tracing the early life of Karol Wojtyla including the death of his mom when he was 9, the death of his older brother when he was 12, the Nazi occupation of Poland, the Nazi deportation of his university professors, his efforts in the Polish underground, his choice to enter an underground seminary, and his father's death when he was 19. As the film traces his career, it emphasizes his intellect (professor of social ethics) and political saavy in dealing with the post-war communist government, making him ideally suited to become the pope who launched Solidarity and brought down Communism in Europe without firing a shot. It then alludes to his criticism of unbridled capitalism and secularism, which became the theme of his later years as pope. Despite billing Pope John Paul II as a ""mystic"" and intellectual artist, the film overwhelmingly views him in the light of secular admiration for his political genius, and is all the more effective for it.The only downside to the film, and it's really minor, is that it feels slightly dated today. Filmed three years before JPII's death, it fails to provide any sort of retrospective or overall perspective of his papacy, and it does not include anything from his moving death and funeral. But in terms of professional artistry and coverage of the late pope's childhood, it's head and shoulders above every other documentary on the market.I also like the DVD called ""Credo,"" a musical tribute by Andrea Bocelli that features his voice singing arias over footage of JPII's life, death and funeral. It's very moving in an emotional way. The more recent film ""Testimony"" hosted by Michael York is pretty good on JPII from his life to death, but focuses too much on the late pope's personal secretary, being based on his memoirs. Most of the network TV documentaries are disposable. Even today, ""Witness to Hope"" remains the best video documentary of John Paul II.",5,Definitive documentary on life of Pope John Paul II,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,3204,"['2002', 'documentary', 'film', 'Witness', 'Hope', 'presented', 'bare-bones', 'DVD', 'only', 'play', 'chapter', 'stop', 'features', 'remarkable', 'accomplishment', 'George', 'Weigel', 'source', 'biography', 'same', 'name', 'be', 'remarkably', 'insightful', 'Karol', 'Wojtyla', 'papacy', 'pulling', 'punches', 'acknowledging', 'controversy', 'simplistically', 'idolizing', 'produced', 'Catholics', 'man', 'who', 'Pope', 'Francis', 'now', 'canonized', 'St.', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'wide', 'variety', 'people', 'Polish', 'political', 'figures', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'Polish-born', 'national', 'security', 'advisor.Most', 'surprising', 'interviews', 'are', 'uniformly', 'English', 'even', 'Polish', 'interviewees', 'speaking', 'flawlessly', 'historical', 'dramatizations', 'are', 'also', 'tastefully', 'done', 'visualizing', 'key', 'moments', 'overwhelming', 'film', 'balancing', 'interview', 'footage', 'remarkably', 'well', 'film', 'extremes', 'being', 'overly', 'talky', 'interviews', 'overly', 'hokey/melodramatic', 'dramatizations', 'Weigel', 'incisive', 'analysis', 'lurks', 'frame', 'even', 'interview', 'footage', 'only', 'rarely', 'sign', 'video', 'quality', 'squarely', 'JPII', 'not', 'official', 'American', 'biographer.The', 'film', 'particularly', 'nice', 'job', 'tracing', 'early', 'life', 'Karol', 'Wojtyla', 'including', 'death', 'mom', 'when', 'was', '9', 'death', 'older', 'brother', 'when', 'was', '12', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'Poland', 'Nazi', 'deportation', 'university', 'professors', 'efforts', 'Polish', 'underground', 'choice', 'enter', 'underground', 'seminary', 'father', 'death', 'when', 'was', '19', 'film', 'career', 'intellect', 'professor', 'social', 'ethics', 'political', 'saavy', 'dealing', 'post-war', 'communist', 'government', 'making', 'ideally', 'suited', 'become', 'pope', 'who', 'launched', 'Solidarity', 'brought', 'down', 'Communism', 'Europe', 'firing', 'shot', 'then', 'criticism', 'unbridled', 'capitalism', 'secularism', 'became', 'theme', 'later', 'years', 'pope', 'billing', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'mystic', 'intellectual', 'artist', 'film', 'overwhelmingly', 'light', 'secular', 'admiration', 'political', 'genius', 'more', 'effective', 'it.The', 'only', 'downside', 'film', 'really', 'minor', 'slightly', 'dated', 'today', 'Filmed', 'three', 'years', 'JPII', 'death', 'provide', 'sort', 'retrospective', 'overall', 'perspective', 'papacy', 'not', 'include', 'anything', 'moving', 'death', 'funeral', 'terms', 'professional', 'artistry', 'coverage', 'late', 'pope', 'childhood', 'head', 'shoulders', 'other', 'documentary', 'market.I', 'also', 'DVD', 'called', 'Credo', 'musical', 'tribute', 'Andrea', 'Bocelli', 'voice', 'singing', 'arias', 'footage', 'JPII', 'life', 'death', 'funeral', 'very', 'moving', 'emotional', 'way', 'more', 'recent', 'film', 'Testimony', 'hosted', 'Michael', 'York', 'pretty', 'good', 'JPII', 'life', 'death', 'too', 'much', 'late', 'pope', 'personal', 'secretary', 'being', 'based', 'memoirs', 'Most', 'network', 'TV', 'documentaries', 'are', 'disposable', 'Even', 'today', 'Witness', 'Hope', 'best', 'video', 'documentary', 'John', 'Paul', 'II']",N/A
