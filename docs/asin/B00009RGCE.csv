757411,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B00009RGCE,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[16, 25]","Five Israeli Defense Force soldiers pictured in this film are suing Palestinian filmmaker Mohammed Bakri for allegedly falsifying information about them. The film charges Israel with genocide in a refugee camp, despite proof that nothing of the sort actually happened. French director Pierre Rehov last year created a film, ""The Road to Jenin"" (available online) that blasts these charges to bits.In a January 2005 deposition, Bakri admitted to falsifying scenes, using inaccurate information and obtaining financing for the project from the Palestinian Authority.The film implies that five IDF soldiers (seen in the film's still footage) in April 2002 killed a ""large number"" of civilians, mutilated Palestinian bodies, randomly executed and bombed women, children and the mentally and physically impaired, and leveled the entire refugee camp, including a wing of the local hospital.But this ""documentary"" contains no footage of the alleged atrocities. Rather, it superimposes the still images over ""eyewitness testimony,"" thereby suggesting that they committed ""war crimes"" in Jenin.[Update, Dec. 20, 2009: In July 2008, an Israeli court ruled that the film was indeed slanderous --- but threw out the IDF plaintiffs' suit against Bakri since the film had not personally singled them out.]Palestinian sources likewise made false allegations of mass murder in April 2002 following the Jenin battle, when they claimed that IDF forces had killed upwards of 500 civilians and wounded thousands. However, the United Nations concluded in a thorough investigation that only 56 Palestinians, mostly gunmen, were killed --- while 23 Israeli soldiers were killed in the battle by booby-trapped houses and suicide bombers, facts that physical evidence confirmed in investigations conducted by several international humanitarian organizations.There was never a massacre in Jenin --- except the massacre of 23 IDF forces.Israel entered Jenin, a terrorist recruitment and operations center, during Operation Defensive Shield to halt a 2001 and early 2002 wave of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Al Aksa Martyrs Brigade suicide bombings. To spare civilian lives, Israeli infantry units fought house-to-house and lost nearly two dozen soldiers to ambushes.Several ""witnesses"" in this film describe IDF ""brutality,"" claiming that Israel attacked and killed ""many, many"" Palestinians with tanks, planes and snipers. But Bakri, like so many others who've made similar false charges, doesn't list the number of Palestinians killed --- much less their names.Rehov's film disproves Bakri's claims, and was cited in the Israeli soldiers' lawsuit. Bakri, for example, charges that Israel fired 11 missiles at a Jenin hospital, leveling the facility with patients inside and later refused to let emergency personnel access the area. Dr. Mustafa Abo Gali says, ""The whole of the west wing was destroyed. Fighter planes launched their missiles every three minutes."" Gali makes the same claim in Rehov's film; but the latter also filmed the ""damage,"" which consists of a small hole outside the building, where the entire west wing remains very much intact. Rehov also shows aerial images of the hospital from the last day of Israel's Jenin incursion; the hospital was fine then, too.Moreover, IDF medical officer Dr. David Zangen tells Rehov (on film) how the soldiers treated wounded Palestinians, including Hamas ""fighters."" This testimony is validated by film shot--at the time--of an Israeli soldier issuing orders that Gali receive all necessary medical supplies.The inconsistencies in this film's ""witness testimony"" are quite plain. One older interviewee claims that Israelis forced Palestinian prisoners to fully undress ""in front of their brothers, sisters and children, who were used as human shields."" But Bakri's accompanying images show a group of Palestinians, all of them wearing pants.The film also alleges that the IDF shot unarmed Palestinian villager Ali Youssef in the hands and feet. Rehov interviewed Youssef for his documentary: Youssef was shot once in the hand--while standing in a housing complex with Hamas gunmen.Moreover, Israeli medics treated Youssef, discovered a congenital heart problem, and transported him to Israel for treatment in an Afula hospital. Hospital papers confirm Rehov's findings that Youseff was not shot in the leg at all.The film also contains deceptive techniques to create false impressions of a massacre. In one scene, a tank heads toward a crowd. The image then blacks out, suggesting the people were all killed, according to Dr. Zangren, who adds that Bakri was not in Jenin at any time during the battle. Yet he deceptively juxtaposes images of Israeli tanks and snipers next to shots of Palestinian children.The five soldiers suing Bakri in Tel Aviv sought more than $500,000 in damages. It alleged that Bakri's false claims had endangered the soldiers' lives: As Israeli reservists, they remained in constant professional contact with Arabs, some of whom could recognize and attack them as a direct result.--Alyssa A.

757416,A111BH1GN0D33Z,B00009RGCE,Folantin,"[39, 62]","Palestinian filmmaker and actor Mohamed Bakri, traveled to the refugee camp of Jenin to document the devastation there. The camp was home to 1000s of refugees before it was ploughed over by Israeli tanks. One comment compares the devastation to resembling an earthquake, and after seeing the film, I would agree with that. However, as the film points out, if this sort of devastation occurred anywhere else, the Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations would swoop in and start digging out the bodies--this does not happen--and the incident is largely ignored by the world.The film footage is quite frankly devastating--piles of rubble everywhere you look, buildings covered in graffiti, and families trying to live in shelled out homes. Of course, there are also hundreds of little tents erected for the refugees.Interviews include local doctors who express frustration at the bombing of their hospital and efforts to recover the dead. Other interviewees include various Palestinians who were shot as they emerged from their homes. By far the most chilling interviews were conducted with a little girl--I'd approximate her age to be about 12. She was obviously an intelligent, articulate child, but instead of the normal 12-year-old concerns, she is focused on rebuilding and never giving up her homeland, and she even relishes the thought of what she'd do to Sharon if he dared show his face in the camp. Such intense nationalism in one so young should give pause for thought. And if that's not enough, there's one scene with small children marching through the streets of Jenin chanting, ""Jerusalem is ours."" Violence begets violence, and ultimately, the children of Jenin are victims of this endless cycle of violence and hate.Some viewers feel this film is propaganda and others see the film as a desperate cry for recognition of an atrocity. ""Jenin Jenin"" has value to the viewer who wishes to learn and experience more on the tragic subject of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I doubt I shall ever forget the Palestinian father who expressed pride that his children are not growing up in fear, and I shall most certainly never forget the ferocity of the little girl who loves her homeland. She reminded me so much of Leila Khaled (author of ""My People Shall Live."")The film left me with many questions--for example, I wish some background had been given concerning the Jenin incident (the Israelis were there after Palestinian fighters). Most documentaries tend to take a hands-off approach these days and hold commentary to a minimum. ""Jenin Jenin"" follows this standard and suffers as a consequence. The film is mostly interviews with local Palestinians mixed with some footage. At the beginning of the film, the hand-held camera was a bit too jerky for my tastes, and there were instances when I wished the subtitles had remained on the screen for a few moments longer.Extra features include bios of the filmmaker and the producer (he was shot shortly after making the film). And there is also a photographic 'slideshow' with an accompanying letter read by the physician who founded KinderUSA, a charitable organization devoted to the children of Palestine--displacedhuman",4,"""How could destiny bring us together?""",1098230400,"10 20, 2004",2004,3189,"['Palestinian', 'filmmaker', 'actor', 'Mohamed', 'Bakri', 'traveled', 'refugee', 'camp', 'Jenin', 'document', 'devastation', 'there', 'camp', 'was', 'home', '1000s', 'refugees', 'was', 'ploughed', 'Israeli', 'tanks', 'One', 'comment', 'devastation', 'resembling', 'earthquake', 'seeing', 'film', 'would', 'agree', 'However', 'film', 'points', 'out', 'sort', 'devastation', 'occurred', 'anywhere', 'else', 'Red', 'Cross', 'other', 'humanitarian', 'organizations', 'would', 'swoop', 'start', 'digging', 'out', 'bodies', 'not', 'happen', 'incident', 'largely', 'ignored', 'world.The', 'film', 'footage', 'quite', 'frankly', 'devastating', 'piles', 'rubble', 'everywhere', 'look', 'buildings', 'covered', 'graffiti', 'families', 'trying', 'live', 'shelled', 'out', 'homes', 'course', 'are', 'also', 'hundreds', 'little', 'tents', 'erected', 'refugees.Interviews', 'include', 'local', 'doctors', 'who', 'express', 'frustration', 'bombing', 'hospital', 'efforts', 'recover', 'dead', 'Other', 'interviewees', 'include', 'various', 'Palestinians', 'who', 'were', 'shot', 'emerged', 'homes', 'far', 'most', 'chilling', 'interviews', 'were', 'conducted', 'little', 'girl', ""'d"", 'approximate', 'age', 'be', 'about', '12', 'was', 'obviously', 'intelligent', 'articulate', 'child', 'instead', 'normal', '12-year-old', 'concerns', 'focused', 'rebuilding', 'never', 'giving', 'up', 'homeland', 'even', 'thought', 'what', ""'d"", 'do', 'Sharon', 'dared', 'show', 'face', 'camp', 'Such', 'intense', 'nationalism', 'one', 'so', 'young', 'should', 'give', 'pause', 'thought', 'not', 'enough', 'one', 'scene', 'small', 'children', 'marching', 'streets', 'Jenin', 'chanting', 'Jerusalem', 'Violence', 'begets', 'violence', 'ultimately', 'children', 'Jenin', 'are', 'victims', 'endless', 'cycle', 'violence', 'hate.Some', 'viewers', 'feel', 'film', 'propaganda', 'others', 'see', 'film', 'desperate', 'cry', 'recognition', 'atrocity', 'Jenin', 'Jenin', 'value', 'viewer', 'who', 'learn', 'experience', 'more', 'tragic', 'subject', 'Israeli-Palestinian', 'conflict', 'doubt', 'shall', 'ever', 'forget', 'Palestinian', 'father', 'who', 'expressed', 'pride', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'growing', 'up', 'fear', 'shall', 'most', 'certainly', 'never', 'forget', 'ferocity', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'homeland', 'reminded', 'so', 'much', 'Leila', 'Khaled', 'author', 'People', 'Shall', 'Live', 'film', 'left', 'many', 'questions', 'example', 'wish', 'background', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'concerning', 'Jenin', 'incident', 'Israelis', 'were', 'there', 'Palestinian', 'fighters', 'Most', 'documentaries', 'tend', 'take', 'hands-off', 'approach', 'days', 'hold', 'commentary', 'minimum', 'Jenin', 'Jenin', 'standard', 'suffers', 'consequence', 'film', 'mostly', 'interviews', 'local', 'Palestinians', 'mixed', 'footage', 'beginning', 'film', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'jerky', 'tastes', 'were', 'instances', 'when', 'wished', 'subtitles', 'had', 'remained', 'screen', 'few', 'moments', 'longer.Extra', 'features', 'include', 'bios', 'filmmaker', 'producer', 'was', 'shot', 'shortly', 'making', 'film', 'also', 'photographic', ""'slideshow"", 'accompanying', 'letter', 'read', 'physician', 'who', 'founded', 'KinderUSA', 'charitable', 'organization', 'devoted', 'children', 'Palestine', 'displacedhuman']",Jenin Jenin VHS
757417,A17X4B27GDCJEY,B00009RGCE,Glutton for books,"[45, 63]","This movie was initially banned when released in Israel, due to allegations that it was a vehicle of propaganda and included lies. Within the last year the Israeli court decision to ban the movie was over turned. In the documentary, director Mohamed Bakri interviews people from Jenin whose houses were demolished, who witnessed the many deaths and destruction of property that resulted from the violent Israeli incursion into the West Bank town of Jenin in 2002.Israeli and International Human Rights groups, as well as many foreign countries denounced the incursion, since collective punishment (such as Israel's routine demolishing houses of suspected criminals; which leaves many families rather than only an alleged criminal homeless) is illegal. There were also stories of an incredible amount or casualites.Israel refused to allow the UN-appointed commission of inquiry or any medical teams to investigate the area during and immediately following the attack (denial of medical teams to treat the injured also violates international law). People who were present described the scene as the equivalnet of genocide and the term massacre was used frequently by reporters who finally found a way to enter Jenin. Photoraphers who were seen attempting to take photos of the destrcution were shot at by Israeli Defense Forces. I remember seeing the horrifying images in papers because I was in Europe at the time, where coverage of the Middle Eat is more objective, and they gave nightmares. By comparison, the US media paid little attention.The Israelis who opposed this film, and not all do, claim that one the people interviewed did not really sustain his injuries from the Israeli actions (the old man in the hospital). They also claimed that an insufficient number of people died in order for the act to be considered ""genocidal"" or ""a massacre.""The movie lets the victims tell their version of the story, which the US media never covers. I doubt it, but I suppose there is a possibility that the onld man may be a person who embellished his tale for the documentary, just as there has been books written by Jews (and well received by book critics) about the horrors of the Holocaust, but who in fact actually lied when they said that they personally experienced them.What is devastating to watch is the all the children who are casualties of the war, and to hear the hatred that is being caused by the violence. Here is a new generation displaced, and full of more anger than any before. How can practices that excite such hatred and hoplessness help improve prospects for peace?The facts that remain undisputed: that many civilians died and much personal property was destroyed; the level of destruction; and that many children were made homeless, are scarred for life (and it is easy to see how they could feel hopeless about peace and become the new recruits for suicide bombing). When Israeli forces destroy Palestian homes, the Israeli state prevents most from rebuilding their houses, by denying them permits and demolishing any houses that are built without the permits. The documentary is not able to demonstrate fully the extent of the damage.As an American, it is sickening to watch the docmumentary and realize that the US is paying for this destruction; it gives Israel more aid than any other country and most of the aid is received in the form of arms used to ruin the lives of Palestinians. It also made me wonder what the US troops are doing to the Iraqi civlians, since they recieved training from Israeli forces, and the US media is nortorious for only preenting the story that the US administration wants its people to hear in times of war.Remember too, while watching this that Jenin is in the West Bank. Palestinians either live in the West Bank or the Gaza Strip, and there is a great difference in living standards between the two. More documentaries (Gaza Strip, A Death in Gaza) have been made that demonstrate the institutionalized horrors of living under Israeli occupation in the Gaza Strip, which the inhabitants and the IDF stationed there often refer to as ""hell."" In comparison, the West Bank has more arable land, much of the water that the Israeli population uses, and is much more desiraeble to Israeli settlers.

DeMeo ""naturalenergyworks""","[19, 50]","I was in Europe and Israel around the time of the daily multiple suicide bombers, blowing up civilians in busses and restaurants, shooting people on the streets, with Arab civilians dancing in the streets afterwards -- passing out sweets to kids and calling the dead murderers ""martyrs"" -- and I asked my Jewish friends aloud ""when will Sharon do something to stop this madness"".  I could not imagine the US, for example, sitting by while Canadian terrorists did such a thing.  Finally, action was taken.  The IDF was sent out, and Jenin was one of the major targets as that's where the bomb-making factories were located. And the whole world, which previously had only been yawning with boredom at the sight of Jews being blown up and mutillated, suddenly went berzerk with indignant ""outrage"" against the Israelis.  European newspapers shouted ""MASSACRE IN JENIN"" as PA spokespersons unashamedly claimed ""thousands of civilians are being massacred"" and called upon the world to come and save them.  Nothing of the sort was happening, however, but this did not stop Amnesty International, Human Right's Watch and various UN representatives from repeating the Palestinian claims without examination.  All the Palestinian claims were reported internationally as if they were ""fact"", while all the Israeli denials were reported as ""claims"".  ""BLOODBATH"" was one headline, in bold red letters, from The Guardian, as I recall, and the UN then sent a well-known antisemite to Israel to ""investigate"".  Understandably, the Israelis refused that man entry, and also refused to allow BBC and other Left-wing ""human rights"" groups in, given their happy willingness to repeat the PA claims without reservation.  The film ""Jenin, Jenin"" basically repeats this story, up to this point.  What it does not say, however, is what happend next.  Finally an acceptable UN investigation team arrived, and so did other international human rights groups, finally to determine that something around 57 person, most of whom were militants carrying guns, had died in a hard military clash in the heart of Jenin, including 23 dead Israeli soldiers, that the IDF had used loudspeakers to warn people away, that only some buildings in the center of the heavily-fortified Jenin center were bulldozed, and there was NO MASSACRE. It was discovered that the Palestinians had dug up old graves, and planted corpses into the rubble, to inflate the death figures, and with my own eyes I saw one funny episode on Israeli television, where a coffin was dropped during a loud and angry Arab funeral outside Jenin, but the ""dead man"" inside the coffin quickly scrambled back inside.  This was caught on video.  And so forth.  Even the PA was finally forced to accept this -- but this film will not give the facts.  It is pure Arab-Islamist propaganda, in the same category as those who claim 9-11 was the product of a CIA/Mossad conspiracy.

Still, in Jenin, the doves in Israel won out, and the battle was handled in a truly heroic and humane fashion. That made no difference to many antizionists, who automatically told the usual lies, such as the ones on this DVD. But it made a big difference to the Israelis, the vast majority of whom are very proud of Israeli behavior in Jenin and see the lies about Jenin as far worse than those about many other battles.The battle for Jenin was a test for antizionists. And many of them flunked it. This movie is a good example of that.  But it is not the only example.  British newspapers such as the Guardian, the Evening Standard, the Independent, and the Times also flunked. And the usually very varied Israeli press was close to unanimous in condemning the lies in these newspapers.According to Dr. David Zangen, who was actually in Jenin during the fighting (Bakri, who made the film, was not there until two weeks later), there are several major lies in this movie. Here are three examples of them:1) The film says that a wing of the Jenin hospital was destroyed and that the Israeli Defence Forces purposely disrupted the supply of water and electricity to the hospital. In fact, the IDF troops were careful not to enter the hospital, even though they were aware that it was being used to shelter wanted people. The IDF maintained the supply of water, electricity and oxygen to the hospital throughout the fighting. And no part of the hospital was shelled or bombed.2) There was a very strange claim about a fatally wounded baby who died after soldiers prevented his evacuation to a hospital. But no body of a baby was found, nor was the name of this baby ever revealed. The person making this claim also told of tanks crushing people alive: this simply did not happen.3) Bakri's film mentions mass graves in which the Israeli soldiers put dead Arabs. However, there is agreement that only 52 Arabs died in the battle.This DVD is indeed anti-Israeli. But it is not really pro-anything. It is propaganda that simply serves to make the world more violent, hate-filled, and murderous.",1,A modern blood libel,1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,2229,"['Should', 'army', 'intentionally', 'more', 'casualties', 'order', 'minimize', 'civilian', 'deaths', 'enemy', 'city', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'decision', 'Still', 'Jenin', 'doves', 'Israel', 'won', 'out', 'battle', 'was', 'handled', 'truly', 'heroic', 'humane', 'fashion', 'made', 'difference', 'many', 'antizionists', 'who', 'automatically', 'told', 'usual', 'lies', 'such', 'ones', 'DVD', 'made', 'big', 'difference', 'Israelis', 'vast', 'majority', 'whom', 'are', 'very', 'proud', 'Israeli', 'behavior', 'Jenin', 'see', 'lies', 'about', 'Jenin', 'far', 'worse', 'many', 'other', 'battles.The', 'battle', 'Jenin', 'was', 'test', 'antizionists', 'many', 'flunked', 'movie', 'good', 'example', 'not', 'only', 'example', 'British', 'newspapers', 'such', 'Guardian', 'Evening', 'Standard', 'Independent', 'Times', 'also', 'flunked', 'usually', 'very', 'varied', 'Israeli', 'press', 'was', 'close', 'unanimous', 'condemning', 'lies', 'newspapers.According', 'Dr.', 'David', 'Zangen', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'Jenin', 'fighting', 'Bakri', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'there', 'two', 'weeks', 'later', 'are', 'several', 'major', 'lies', 'movie', 'Here', 'are', 'three', 'examples', 'them:1', 'film', 'wing', 'Jenin', 'hospital', 'was', 'destroyed', 'Israeli', 'Defence', 'Forces', 'purposely', 'disrupted', 'supply', 'water', 'electricity', 'hospital', 'fact', 'IDF', 'troops', 'were', 'careful', 'not', 'enter', 'hospital', 'even', 'were', 'aware', 'was', 'being', 'used', 'shelter', 'wanted', 'people', 'IDF', 'maintained', 'supply', 'water', 'electricity', 'oxygen', 'hospital', 'fighting', 'part', 'hospital', 'was', 'shelled', 'bombed.2', 'was', 'very', 'strange', 'claim', 'fatally', 'wounded', 'baby', 'who', 'died', 'soldiers', 'prevented', 'evacuation', 'hospital', 'body', 'baby', 'was', 'found', 'was', 'name', 'baby', 'ever', 'revealed', 'person', 'making', 'claim', 'also', 'told', 'tanks', 'crushing', 'people', 'alive', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'happen.3', 'Bakri', 'film', 'mentions', 'mass', 'graves', 'Israeli', 'soldiers', 'put', 'dead', 'Arabs', 'However', 'agreement', 'only', '52', 'Arabs', 'died', 'battle.This', 'DVD', 'indeed', 'anti-Israeli', 'not', 'really', 'pro-anything', 'propaganda', 'simply', 'make', 'world', 'more', 'violent', 'hate-filled', 'murderous']",Jenin Jenin VHS

Israeli troops went charging into this camp in response to numerous terrorist bombings.  The army had intelligence that the camp was literally chalk full of terrorists and weapons.  During the fighting that ensued rumors leaked out that a `massacre' had taken place.  The western media quickly arrived and interviewed left wing Israeli activists and Palestinian `survivors'.  The Palestinians told a tale of mass graves and `genocide' and a little known Israeli Arab(Arab living in Israel) took up a crusade to `document' the `massacre'.  This film is his documentary.  It details a series of interviews of Palestinians who supposedly witnessed the Israel incursion and the subsequent battle.  These Palestinians all claim to have witnessed the mass murder of their compatriots at the hands of non-other then the butcher of Sabra and Shatilla, Arik Sharon.Of course this is one half of the story.  The second half is that this documentary is mostly propaganda and hyperbole and does not bother to reveal the subsequent investigation by the U.N, Israel and other bodies that concluded only 30 people had been killed, almost all of whom were young men who were probably combatants.  The Investigation proved beyond doubt that a `massacre' had not taken place.  The investigations also proved that the Israeli army had gone to great lengths to not harm civilians, but due to the crowded nature of the camp some civilians had been killed, by mistake.  `Jenin Jenin' is a battle cry that was created to infuse westerners with hate towards Israel.  The documentary tries to show that Israel is a veritable `fascist' state that routinely rounds up Palestinians and massacres them. This film is almost all lies and the interviewees either were telling lies or they simply had thought they witnessed something that was incorrect.  Frequently during the fog of war it may seem that hundreds of people are being killed when in reality only a few actually die and most end up wounded from shrapnel.  This is frequently the case in a small arms fire fight, it may seem like a terrible battle but subsequent casualty lists will show it to be mostly bloodless.  The Palestinians saw hundreds of tanks and Israeli soldiers and the volume of fire certainly made them feel that a massacre was taking place.  But the documentary doesn't include any of the actual footage of the conclusions of the investigators, and its images are mostly propaganda meant to convey that terrible destruction took place when in reality a small portion of the camp was damaged.  Recommended reading to accompany this film is `Image and Reality' by Finkelstein, `Case for Israel' by Dershowitz and `The new anti-Semitism' by Foxman.

To these people, proof makes no difference, to them Israel is never guilty. Apologists for the Israeli regime strongly believe that Israelis are infallible and omnipotent. That Israeli soldiers target young children and impose curfews is unimportant to these individuals. That old people, women and young children are constantly subjected to degradation and harassment at the so called checkpoints makes no difference either. In the documentary Checkpoint, the Israeli soldiers refer to the Palestinians as the cattle, not as decent human beings worthy of respect. Furthermore, they harass the Palestinian females and use derogatory remarks when these girls cross the checkpoints. Imagine what it must feel like being stopped on your way to work and on your way home. Contrary to what some people think, the Palestinians are not free. Given that their movement is severely restrained and given all these curfews that are being imposed on them, are they really free? Israelis feel omnipotent having the U.S. government on their side. Given that Israel is militarily superior to the Palestinians, how can this be a fair and balanced conflict? The Palestinians are throwing stones while the Israelis are utilizing sophisticated weaponry with which they target young boys throwing stones at them! Talk about gross injustice. I strongly recommend this documentary. It is a tragic story of powerless people facing a much more powerful adversary. It is a tragic story of the people devoid of hope and of the people in great despair. It is an unfathomable tragedy taking place before the eyes of the entire international community. It leaves one wondering, does anyone in this world care about human suffering and justice?",5,An important insight into the Israel\Palestine conflict,1096848000,"10 4, 2004",2004,2318,"['Checkpoint', 'documentary', 'masterful', 'account', 'unfathomable', 'suffering', 'Palestinian', 'people', 'compelling', 'evidence', 'countless', 'human', 'rights', 'violations', 'perpetrated', 'Israeli', 'army', 'Jenin', 'addition', 'providing', 'revealing', 'footage', 'Jenin', 'documentary', 'numerous', 'witness', 'testimonies', 'doubt', 'what', 'happened', 'Jenin', 'serious', 'violation', 'international', 'law', 'Unfortunately', 'always', 'been', 'case', 'past', 'whenever', 'Israel', 'severe', 'criticism', 'people', 'go', 'great', 'lengths', 'deny', 'what', 'happened', 'people', 'proof', 'difference', 'Israel', 'never', 'guilty', 'Apologists', 'Israeli', 'regime', 'strongly', 'believe', 'Israelis', 'are', 'infallible', 'omnipotent', 'Israeli', 'soldiers', 'target', 'young', 'children', 'impose', 'curfews', 'unimportant', 'individuals', 'old', 'people', 'women', 'young', 'children', 'are', 'constantly', 'subjected', 'degradation', 'harassment', 'so', 'called', 'checkpoints', 'difference', 'either', 'documentary', 'Checkpoint', 'Israeli', 'soldiers', 'refer', 'Palestinians', 'cattle', 'not', 'decent', 'human', 'beings', 'worthy', 'respect', 'Furthermore', 'harass', 'Palestinian', 'females', 'use', 'derogatory', 'remarks', 'when', 'girls', 'cross', 'checkpoints', 'Imagine', 'what', 'must', 'feel', 'being', 'stopped', 'way', 'work', 'way', 'home', 'Contrary', 'what', 'people', 'think', 'Palestinians', 'are', 'not', 'free', 'Given', 'movement', 'severely', 'restrained', 'given', 'curfews', 'are', 'being', 'imposed', 'are', 'really', 'free', 'Israelis', 'feel', 'omnipotent', 'having', 'U.S.', 'government', 'side', 'Given', 'Israel', 'militarily', 'superior', 'Palestinians', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'fair', 'balanced', 'conflict', 'Palestinians', 'are', 'throwing', 'stones', 'Israelis', 'are', 'utilizing', 'sophisticated', 'weaponry', 'target', 'young', 'boys', 'throwing', 'stones', 'Talk', 'gross', 'injustice', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'tragic', 'story', 'powerless', 'people', 'facing', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'adversary', 'tragic', 'story', 'people', 'devoid', 'hope', 'people', 'great', 'despair', 'unfathomable', 'tragedy', 'taking', 'place', 'eyes', 'entire', 'international', 'community', 'one', 'wondering', 'anyone', 'world', 'care', 'human', 'suffering', 'justice']",Jenin Jenin VHS
