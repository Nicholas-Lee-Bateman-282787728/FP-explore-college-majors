591674,A3JCW6YA3C6Z6S,B00005JKWG,Andrew Mendelssohn,"[3, 5]","First, let me comment on the DVD...  great picture, no real problems with contrast despite the fact this is a dark film, and good quality audio....About the film...  I was disappointed.  The submarine is accurate, but beyond that this film is not much of a military thriller.  The military plot is purely secondary to the ghost story involved in the film, and in my opinion the ghost story was predictable.  Regarding the military story, a US submarine is on patrol in the Atlantic when it is ordered to pick up survivors from a torpedoed boat.  One of the survivors is a woman, something that is supposed to bring bad luck to the boat crew.  Sure enough, things start going wrong (to strange) almost immediately after the people are rescued.Regarding the military plot, the boat is stalked by a German destroyer for a long period of time.  At one point, the sub is resting on the bottom of the sea trying to avoid detection.  Where is this?  I don't know one place in the open Atlantic that is shallow enough, and the boat is supposed to be within a few days of England.At another point, there are divers outside the sub trying to fix a problem, and in the very distance you can see flashes and concussions from depth charges...  well, if the charges were close enough to see they would kill the divers, and if they were so far away you could see them but not hear them.  So much for realism....OK, its a movie.  You should suspend your disbelief.  Regarding the ghost story, I thought it was strictly boiler plate.  This is a story that could happen almost anyplace, and the sub was chosen just for its novelty.  It does add a certain amount of claustrophobic atmosphere, but beyond that I found the story a little predictable.  Worth a rental, but not spectacular....  trust me, while the acting is good and the atmosphere and setting a bit novel you have seen this film before, just with a different skin.",2,OK for rental,1048464000,"03 24, 2003",2003,1909,"['First', 'let', 'comment', 'DVD', 'great', 'picture', 'real', 'problems', 'contrast', 'fact', 'dark', 'film', 'good', 'quality', 'audio', 'film', 'was', 'disappointed', 'submarine', 'accurate', 'film', 'not', 'much', 'military', 'thriller', 'military', 'plot', 'purely', 'secondary', 'ghost', 'story', 'involved', 'film', 'opinion', 'ghost', 'story', 'was', 'predictable', 'Regarding', 'military', 'story', 'US', 'submarine', 'patrol', 'Atlantic', 'when', 'ordered', 'pick', 'up', 'survivors', 'torpedoed', 'boat', 'One', 'survivors', 'woman', 'something', 'supposed', 'bring', 'bad', 'luck', 'boat', 'crew', 'Sure', 'enough', 'things', 'start', 'going', 'wrong', 'strange', 'almost', 'immediately', 'people', 'are', 'rescued.Regarding', 'military', 'plot', 'boat', 'stalked', 'German', 'destroyer', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'one', 'point', 'sub', 'resting', 'bottom', 'sea', 'trying', 'avoid', 'detection', 'Where', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'place', 'open', 'Atlantic', 'shallow', 'enough', 'boat', 'supposed', 'be', 'few', 'days', 'England.At', 'point', 'are', 'divers', 'sub', 'trying', 'fix', 'problem', 'very', 'distance', 'can', 'see', 'flashes', 'concussions', 'depth', 'charges', 'well', 'charges', 'were', 'close', 'enough', 'see', 'would', 'kill', 'divers', 'were', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'could', 'see', 'not', 'hear', 'So', 'much', 'realism', '.OK', 'movie', 'should', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'Regarding', 'ghost', 'story', 'thought', 'was', 'strictly', 'boiler', 'plate', 'story', 'could', 'happen', 'almost', 'anyplace', 'sub', 'was', 'chosen', 'just', 'novelty', 'add', 'certain', 'amount', 'claustrophobic', 'atmosphere', 'found', 'story', 'little', 'predictable', 'rental', 'not', 'spectacular', 'trust', 'acting', 'good', 'atmosphere', 'setting', 'bit', 'novel', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'just', 'different', 'skin']",Below
591675,A34A7QEBMYTALW,B00005JKWG,"Arthur Kicker ""Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged""","[2, 2]","Going into 'Below', I didn't know what to expect.  I mean it was directed by David Twohy, director of two of the most meatheaded flicks starring just about the biggest meatheaded actor in cinema('Pitch Black' and its fecal-tinged sequel 'Chronicles Of Riddick').  But on the other hand, it was co-written by Darren Aronofsky, the writer/director of recent indy classics 'Pi' and 'Requiem For A Dream'.  So I didn't know if I was gonna get a meatheaded submarine action flick or a thoughtful yet slightly warped psychological thriller.  To tell you the truth:  you don't really get either...but 'Below' is still a pretty good little film.The film goes a little something like this:  a US submarine is in the Atlantic playing a bit of cat-and-mouse with a German U-boat.  The US sub comes across the remnants of a sinking British hospital ship.  The sub's occupants find three survivors and bring them aboard.  And that is when the strange occurances begin...First off, there's no real main character.  'Below' is an ensemble piece and everyone is brilliant.  The cast is filled with many faces you will recognize but may not be able to name:  Bruce Greenwood(from television's cult classic 'Nowhere Man' and various films), Holt McCallany('CSI: Miami'), Matthew Davis('Legally Blonde' and 'Blue Crush'), Dexter Fletcher('Layer Cake', 'Doom'), Scott Foley(TV's 'Scrubs'), Zach Galifiakis(standup comic and from TV's 'Tru Calling'), and quite a few cast members from HBO's 'Band Of Brothers'.  So whoever did the casting for this little low budget independant definitely deserves some praise for bringing together such a fine cast.The plot and script are well done, though in the end leaves you with a lot more questions than answers.  The cinematography is excellent and the special effects are well done, considering the film's budget restraints.  All the perfomances are absolutely excellent and is by far the main reason to see this flick.  The only major complaint is that the film, set during 1943, just doesn't feel like it.  It feels like present day.  There's no dated lingo or pop culture references to really make it feel like a WWII movie.  If the filmmakers didn't tell you at the beginning what year it was taking place in, you might not realize that the film was set over sixty years ago.But my one little qualm aside, 'Below' is a very good, involving, taut, little horror/psychological thriller that will be over before you know it and you will definitely enjoy.  Great performances and excellent behind the scenes work make this film one of the best movies that you haven't yet seen.  Definitely worth a rental and possibly a purchase.  Check it out.And if you like this one, here's a couple more period piece horror flicks you might like:  'Dead Birds'(a Civil War-era film involving some Confedrate deserters/bank robbers and a haunted house they use for a hideout)and 'Deathwatch'(an atmospheric WWI horror flick set in the trenches).",4,'Below' Is Above-Average,1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,2952,"['Going', ""'Below"", 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'mean', 'was', 'directed', 'David', 'Twohy', 'director', 'two', 'most', 'meatheaded', 'flicks', 'starring', 'just', 'biggest', 'meatheaded', 'actor', 'cinema', 'Black', 'fecal-tinged', 'sequel', ""'Chronicles"", 'Riddick', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'co-written', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'writer/director', 'recent', 'indy', 'classics', ""'Requiem"", 'Dream', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'gon', 'get', 'meatheaded', 'submarine', 'action', 'flick', 'thoughtful', 'yet', 'slightly', 'warped', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'tell', 'truth', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', ""'Below"", 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'little', 'film.The', 'film', 'little', 'something', 'US', 'submarine', 'Atlantic', 'playing', 'bit', 'cat-and-mouse', 'German', 'U-boat', 'US', 'sub', 'remnants', 'sinking', 'British', 'hospital', 'ship', 'sub', 'occupants', 'find', 'three', 'survivors', 'bring', 'aboard', 'when', 'strange', 'occurances', 'begin', 'First', 'off', 'real', 'main', 'character', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'everyone', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'filled', 'many', 'will', 'recognize', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'name', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'television', 'cult', 'classic', 'Man', 'various', 'films', 'Holt', 'McCallany', 'Miami', 'Matthew', 'Davis', ""'Legally"", 'Blonde', 'Crush', 'Dexter', 'Fletcher', ""'Layer"", 'Cake', ""'Doom"", 'Scott', 'Foley', 'TV', ""'Scrubs"", 'Zach', 'Galifiakis', 'standup', 'comic', 'TV', ""'Tru"", 'Calling', 'quite', 'few', 'cast', 'members', 'HBO', ""'Band"", 'Brothers', 'whoever', 'did', 'casting', 'little', 'low', 'budget', 'independant', 'definitely', 'praise', 'bringing', 'together', 'fine', 'cast.The', 'plot', 'script', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'end', 'lot', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'considering', 'film', 'budget', 'restraints', 'perfomances', 'are', 'absolutely', 'excellent', 'far', 'main', 'reason', 'see', 'flick', 'only', 'major', 'complaint', 'film', 'set', '1943', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'present', 'day', 'dated', 'lingo', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'really', 'make', 'feel', 'WWII', 'movie', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'beginning', 'what', 'year', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'might', 'not', 'realize', 'film', 'was', 'set', 'over', 'sixty', 'years', 'one', 'little', 'qualm', 'aside', ""'Below"", 'very', 'good', 'involving', 'taut', 'little', 'horror/psychological', 'thriller', 'will', 'be', 'know', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'Great', 'performances', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'work', 'make', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'Definitely', 'rental', 'possibly', 'purchase', 'Check', 'out.And', 'like', 'one', 'here', 'couple', 'more', 'period', 'horror', 'flicks', 'might', 'like', ""'Dead"", 'Birds', 'Civil', 'War-era', 'film', 'involving', 'Confedrate', 'deserters/bank', 'robbers', 'haunted', 'house', 'use', 'hideout', 'atmospheric', 'WWI', 'horror', 'flick', 'set', 'trenches']",Below

A depth charge bounces slowly along the stretch of the sub before teetering on the edge...and we watch in complete suspense.  As for the DVD, the transfer is crisp, the audio is incredible (as creaks and moans play an important role in the film), and the special features are good.

591678,A1X86Y6MIBJ4M4,B00005JKWG,"Azrim Civesuac ""Tandara Mandara""","[4, 5]","The only reason why I saw this was because the name Darren Aronofsky (Requiem For A Dream, Pi) was attached to it. Not as a director but as a co-writer and a producer. Sources say this movie was actually suppose to have been directed by Darren but he decided to do Requiem For A Dream instead, and for that.. I really can't blame him since Requiem For A Dream was one of my favorite movies. Anyway, the movie was done by the director David Twohy who is known for Pitch Black and for the upcoming Riddick. Even though I would have loved to see what Aronofsky could have done this movie, we don't always get what we want but even so, David Twohy did a good job with this little unknown film.An extremely claustrophobic thriller that naturally takes place inside of a submarine with bunch of crew members who are hiding a dark secret. An American submarine in a middle of a World War II picks up two Brits and one of them just so happens to be a very attractive lady, Claire Paige (Olivia Williams, Sixth Sense, Rushmore). Naturally, with nothing but men in the submarine, problems arise with the the little lady who just wants everyone to get along. (The way the crew introduced the arrival of Claire Page into the submarine was absolutely hilarious by the way) Aside of this, the crew members start hearing horror like voices and seeing things they would only see in their nightmares. Little do they know that some of them are keeping a very dirty secret that will eventually take over them whether they like it or not, an unexplainable chain of events takes over the story and glues you to the screen.I can already tell that I will be getting quite a few e-mails from visitors of this site, flipping out over the fact that I gave this movie a 3/5 star rating. Now I am no way saying this movie will be liked by everyone, I personally believe it was really good for what it promised. If you liked a certain thriller called Session 9, you will most likely enjoy this movie as well because they both focus on the mood rather than on the straight forward scare tactics approach that most horror/thriller movies focus on. By all means, it's not a scary movie, it's not a typical horror flick either, however, it is a creepy thriller that really got the short end of the stick as far it's release goes.

This one is like a cross betweenGhost StoryandRun Silent, Run Deep. An American submarine rescues three survivors from a British hospital ship that had been sunk a couple days before. Odd things start happening aboard the submarine while they are being hunted by a German destroyer. Is there a saboteur on board or ghosts? Bruce Greenwood (Double Jeopardy) does a great job as the acting Captain as does Olivia Williams (The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)) as the suspicious survivor.

Three survivors from the Sub Tender are picked up, and fun really starts in earnest.

591683,AJLPBMAJKIKOK,B00005JKWG,Christopher Thomas Rennirt,"[0, 0]","Below is an excellent horror film which I highly recommend!  It's also an often overlooked gem of a horror movie that's still out there for many future fans to discover.The setting is World War II, in a U.S. submarine, at various depths in the Atlantic Ocean.  What else can one ask for in setting the stage for a voyage of supernatural scares?  Not much, I say.Yes, Below is a great ghost story that very successfully delivers the scares, only picking up steam, as it dives to ever greater depths.  The story is genuinely creepy and even makes you look over your shoulders a few times for what else may be in the room with you.  It's also an original story, without the typical Hollywood plot holes in most films these days.  With all the predictable, clich&eacute;d, and just-like-all-the-other movies out there, Below surely stands out in the fleet.  It has high production values, lots of style, great acting, excellent special effects, outstanding cinematography, and everything else you'd expect from a premium horror film.Below is also a ghost story with a good deal of mystery and suspense, culminating in an ending with a twist that satisfies.  What's better is that all this claustrophobic horror happens hundreds of feet beneath the ocean, during a war, in a submarine, with some not-so-happy ghosts as crew!  It's bad enough when you have plenty of room to run.  However, all of that in a submarine is about as bad as it gets!  So, make sure you check out Below.

Dimension Films, for some reason, buried this film and now it seems to be enjoying a new life on video and cable (where I caught it).The first strike against it is that it's a submarine movie. With the exception of Das Boot and The Hunt for Red October, sub movies are awful (K-19 anyone?). Below, happily, bucks the trend by expertly conveying the nightmarishly claustrophobic feeling of being trapped in a long tin can under tons of water. If that weren't enough of a problem, something creepy is lurking in and around the submarine.The film features a really interesting cast of character actors. People like Bruce Greenwood (13 Days), Matthew Davis (Blue Crush and this film is the spitting image of a young Harrison Ford!), Dexter Fletcher (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), and Zach Galifianakis (TV's Tru Calling) to name just a few, are all excellent in this movie. It is a true ensemble piece, which is one the many things that makes the movie so enjoyable to watch.The script by Darren Aronofsky and David Twohy is smart and yet delivers all the requisite thrills and chills needed. The attention to period detail is also good. I'm sure the filmmakers were working on a limited budget but they really do a good job in conveying the feeling that this is set during WWII. It is the little details, the personal items that each crewmember has that fleshes out the film and gives it dimension.I can't say enough good things about this movie.

There are some genuinely eerie and &quot;Gee, that WAS creepy!&quot; moments in this film.  The creepiest, for me, being a couple of different glimpses of a ghostly image, seen by the camera for just the briefest of instants.  Very effective.  (Be quick on the &quot;Pause&quot; button for these chilling moments in the movie.  On Freeze-Frame, they're even creepier.)The movie's photography is highly stylish and effective, with great use of lighting, darkness, shadows, and some bright, bold colors on occasion.  One particularly-stunning moment comes early in the picture when we see the image of an approaching warship being reflected in the eye of the officer looking through the submarine's periscope.  This is another good place to utilize your DVD Player's Pause function.  And, due to the incredibly-clear anamorphic widescreen image we're treated to on this Digital Disc, it will pause with perfect clarity as well.This DVD edition gives us some extra goodies, too -- definitely worthy of attention.  There's a director's commentary track, three deleted scenes, the theatrical trailer, and some bonus trailers. (I enjoyed the &quot;Sneak Peeks&quot;, which feature trailers for other films. These &quot;Peeks&quot; are presented in booming 5.1 Surround Sound, as is the trailer for this film.  Nice!)But my favorite &quot;bonus&quot; here is a short 12-minute featurette called &quot;The Process&quot;, which shows several behind-the-camera clips from the film. Much of what we see in this bonus is rehearsal footage, which is then shown alongside the actual footage which ended up in the movie.  This brief featurette, like the film itself, exhibits very high production values.  It surprised me that they'd put this much &quot;stylish&quot; emphasis on a short twelve-minute bonus piece.  But they did....and it's a very nice little bonus on the DVD.&quot;Below&quot; is an intelligent, thoughtful, and realistically-spooky tale.  It's not &quot;over the top&quot;, but it's not totally void of ghostly imagery either.  It's somewhere in between.  Darn good set of actors here too.

Submarines are already a bit spooky in the first place, by their very nature.  The present DVD takes all the &quot;regular&quot; bizarre traits of a sub and takes them all to a whole new level.The story centers around an American sub that picks up 3 British persons, all of them survivors of the sinking of their ship.  From there on, things seem to continually go from bad to worse for the sub &amp; her crew.  A strange sequence of events come to pass.  Some of them are explainable &amp; some of them not so explainable.The set design &amp; direction does a good job of depicting the submarine as an underwater tomb.  Everything about the film is nice and eerie.  Although I've seen plenty of submarine movies, none of them have the chilling edge that this one has.One of the most annoying motifs of horror /  supernatural films is at the end of the movie, when things seem to be &quot;normal,&quot; there is always the hint of the return of the evil / supernatural entity.  Thankfully, this present DVD omits that everpresent and aggravating trend.

591693,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B00005JKWG,D. S. Thurlow,"[0, 0]","2002's ""Below"" is a surprisingly good thriller that passed almost unnoticed through the box office.  The movie mixes drama, suspense, horror, and creepiness in equal porportions in what might have been a standard World War II action piece, but ends up being much more.The movie is set aboard the USS Tiger Shark, a World War II submarine on patrol in the Atlantic in 1943.  When the Tiger Shark is diverted to pick up survivors from a sunken British hospital ship, a routine rescue mission goes badly wrong.  No sooner are three survivors, including a British nurse (Olivia Williams), installed below decks than the ship begins to suffer a series of mishaps and mysterious incidents.  The boat's captain (Bruce Greenwood) and his crew find themselves slowly losing control of the submarine and, seemingly, of their senses.  It will be left to the British nurse and one of the submarine's junior officers (Matt Davis) to figure out why, before everyone dies a horrible death below...The plot gets feed to the audience in small dribbles; the emphasis is on an increasingly claustrophic atmosphere inside a dark hull, where things keep going bump in the night.

The acting is very good, as is the score, the sound design, production design, and the editing - this is not some slapped together mediocre low-budget movie. The producers are clearly sincere in their efforts to convey a meaningful story (with actual character development and solid themes), while keeping things very creepy. One of the best aspects of the story is that the viewer is never certain whether the submarine is haunted (what a great idea! Horror fans love those isolated settings!) or whether what the characters are experiencing is the result of  O2 deprivation or stress. My only complaint is that the viewer is likely to be ahead of the curve with regard to the mystery behind the haunting - I think the director drops a couple too many clues too early on; but this is a minor complaint.

591696,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00005JKWG,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[0, 0]","It was the 1999. A young filmmaker has finished writing a submarine horror/thriller film. He is ready to turn the script into a film as his second Directorial effort. Instead, he will direct Requiem for a Dream, which will be held in high regard by many. This young filmmaker was named Darren Aronofsky and that film was called ""Below."" Instead, the script lied around until it was picked up by director David Twohy, and after a few re-writes, the film began production, modestly budgeted, with a very unknown at the time cast. Then as the film was ready to come out, it was uncerimonisoly dumped by the sudio. What, a film distributed by the Weinstein was crapped upon and sent out into the wild to breed? Shocking, I know. The result was a gross of six-hundered THOUSAND dollars. It was subsequently forgotten and now lives on Netflix Watch Instantly. So, is it any good?The description of ""horror film"" doesn't exactly apply here. Below may seem cut and dry, and in some ways it is, but it's actually a mood-driven mystery thriller film set in a submarine, with some supernatural elements. Essentially, a submarine on the tail-end of its mission, the crew weary and on edge as all get out, picks up three Brits they were ordered to assist from a wreak, one of whom turns out to be a Nazi, who the crew quickly eliminates. It's about this point, unrelated to the Nazi mind you, that weird stuff starts happening. The crew starts seeing things, hearing voices, and the sub suffers a series of mechanical setbacks, all while the sub is being stalked by a German ship. Did I also mention that the Captain only recently became the Captain of the sub after the mysterious death of the old Captain.Like I said, most of the film is based on mood. As the movie goes on, as the bad things start mounting, and the crew becomes increasingly paranoid, the mood just gets more and more dire. Plus, it's set in a sub, and the mood that comes from that is great. Sure, people die, and there is a little violence/gore, but the film is overall VERY minimalistic. The most grusome death shown is a guy swimming outside the sub without scuba gear on the bottom of the ocean, where the pressure kind of expands him. Also, a guy gets a hammer stuck in his face I think, but it's really brief. Nope. The mood is why you should watch this movie.Also, the cast is pretty good considering how no-name most of them are, expecially in 2002. Zach Galifinakis is here in a somewhat substancial role (you can certainly reconize him from the beard), Scott Foley from TV's ""The Unit,"" Holt McCallany from the recent movie ""The Losers,"" Olivia Williams from various stuff (although she's the worst character of the film since she has a lot of annoying moments), Matthew Davis (who is actually pretty decent as the lead of the film) who played Warner from the film ""Legally Blonde,"" and of course, you have the great Bruce Greenwood being Bruce Greenwood. This is actually one of the more villainous roles for him, but he's perfectly fine, even though he's part of a reveal and last 10 minutes I just didn't really care for.Overall, Below is certainly a film worth checking out. It plays with minimalistic horror a lot, and it strikes a very compelling mood, anchored (See what I did there?) by a suprisingly decent cast and script. It's not brilliant by any means, but it's certainly better than you'll expect it to be.",4,Below is Above Expectations,1286496000,"10 8, 2010",2010,3388,"['was', '1999', 'young', 'filmmaker', 'finished', 'writing', 'submarine', 'horror/thriller', 'film', 'ready', 'turn', 'script', 'film', 'second', 'Directorial', 'effort', 'Instead', 'will', 'direct', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'will', 'be', 'held', 'high', 'regard', 'many', 'young', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'named', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'film', 'was', 'called', 'Below', 'Instead', 'script', 'lied', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'director', 'David', 'Twohy', 'few', 're-writes', 'film', 'began', 'production', 'modestly', 'budgeted', 'very', 'unknown', 'time', 'cast', 'Then', 'film', 'was', 'ready', 'come', 'out', 'was', 'uncerimonisoly', 'dumped', 'sudio', 'What', 'film', 'distributed', 'Weinstein', 'was', 'crapped', 'sent', 'out', 'wild', 'breed', 'Shocking', 'know', 'result', 'was', 'gross', 'six-hundered', 'THOUSAND', 'dollars', 'was', 'subsequently', 'forgotten', 'now', 'Netflix', 'Watch', 'Instantly', 'So', 'good', 'description', 'horror', 'film', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'apply', 'here', 'Below', 'may', 'seem', 'cut', 'dry', 'ways', 'actually', 'mood-driven', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'film', 'set', 'submarine', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'Essentially', 'submarine', 'tail-end', 'mission', 'crew', 'weary', 'edge', 'get', 'out', 'up', 'three', 'Brits', 'were', 'ordered', 'assist', 'wreak', 'one', 'whom', 'out', 'be', 'Nazi', 'who', 'crew', 'quickly', 'point', 'unrelated', 'Nazi', 'mind', 'weird', 'stuff', 'happening', 'crew', 'seeing', 'things', 'hearing', 'voices', 'sub', 'series', 'mechanical', 'setbacks', 'sub', 'being', 'stalked', 'German', 'ship', 'Did', 'also', 'mention', 'Captain', 'only', 'recently', 'became', 'Captain', 'sub', 'mysterious', 'death', 'old', 'Captain.Like', 'said', 'most', 'film', 'based', 'mood', 'movie', 'bad', 'things', 'start', 'mounting', 'crew', 'increasingly', 'paranoid', 'mood', 'just', 'more', 'more', 'dire', 'set', 'sub', 'mood', 'great', 'Sure', 'people', 'die', 'little', 'violence/gore', 'film', 'overall', 'VERY', 'minimalistic', 'most', 'grusome', 'death', 'shown', 'guy', 'swimming', 'sub', 'scuba', 'gear', 'bottom', 'ocean', 'where', 'pressure', 'kind', 'expands', 'Also', 'guy', 'hammer', 'stuck', 'face', 'think', 'really', 'brief', 'Nope', 'mood', 'why', 'should', 'watch', 'movie.Also', 'cast', 'pretty', 'good', 'considering', 'how', 'no-name', 'most', 'are', 'expecially', '2002', 'Zach', 'Galifinakis', 'here', 'somewhat', 'substancial', 'role', 'can', 'certainly', 'reconize', 'beard', 'Scott', 'Foley', 'TV', 'Unit', 'Holt', 'McCallany', 'recent', 'movie', 'Losers', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'various', 'stuff', 'worst', 'character', 'film', 'lot', 'annoying', 'moments', 'Matthew', 'Davis', 'who', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'lead', 'film', 'who', 'played', 'Warner', 'film', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'course', 'have', 'great', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'being', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'actually', 'one', 'more', 'villainous', 'roles', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'even', 'part', 'reveal', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'for.Overall', 'Below', 'certainly', 'film', 'checking', 'out', 'minimalistic', 'horror', 'lot', 'very', 'compelling', 'mood', 'anchored', 'See', 'what', 'did', 'there', 'suprisingly', 'decent', 'cast', 'script', 'not', 'brilliant', 'means', 'certainly', 'better', ""'ll"", 'expect', 'be']",Below

591711,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00005JKWG,Jeffrey Leach,"[21, 22]","When I heard about a horror movie called ""Below"" set on a submarine during World War II, I knew I had to sit up and take note. I also noticed that Darren Aronofsky wrote the screenplay. If you don't know this chap, he's the guy who translated Hubert Selby's shattering novel about drug addiction, ""Requiem for a Dream,"" to the silver screen. Moreover, ""Pitch Black"" director David Twohy stepped in to lens the picture. Sounds great, doesn't it? There is as much talent in front of the camera as there is behind it, too. But putting all of that aside, isn't it great when someone makes a submarine picture? We just don't see enough of these movies today, or not enough GOOD submarine pictures. I suspect ""Das Boot"" sort of ruined the genre for everyone else--that, and the excellent ""The Hunt for Red October."" Once someone makes an excellent film in any particular genre, all other efforts must inevitably measure up or be considered a failure. ""Below"" contains many scenes found in other submarine films--the claustrophobia of life in a tin box beneath the waves and the horror of dodging depth charges are two examples that come to mind immediately--but the movie differs by adding a horror twist to the mix.The troubles start when the captain of the USS Tiger Shark (the submarine in question) goes overboard after sinking an enemy vessel. Now commanded by Brice (Bruce Greenwood), the ship picks up three survivors from a sinking British medical ship on the way back to port. The crew of submariners, always a superstitious lot in the grand tradition of sailors everywhere, strenuously objects to picking up these survivors. Why? Not because they are hardhearted but because one of them is a female nurse and everyone knows a woman onboard translates into the worst of luck. Sometimes superstitions ring true. No sooner does Nurse Claire (Olivia Williams) arrive than weird things start happening. A German ship draws a bead on the sub and drops lots of depth charges, a couple of which seriously damage the submarine. Even worse, weird and unexplainable events start popping up with frightening regularity, for example the deceased captain's record player springing to life at the worst possible times. The crew starts to hear strange noises outside the vessel, noises that defy attempts to explain them away as whale songs or other predictable sounds. An assessment of the sub's damage confirms that hydrogen levels in the ship are rising to amounts that can cause hallucinations and paranoia. The boat is also suffering from an oil leak that threatens to destroy the engines.At some point in the narrative, Brice begins to deteriorate mentally. So does the rest of the crew, several members of which begin to see odd reflections and shadows inside the ship. By the time a bunch of the guys have to don scuba gear and go outside to repair the leak the viewer comes to expect imminent disaster. Not yet, though. One more horrific event takes place that sends the crew of the USS Tiger Shark into paroxysms of fear: the sub begins to chart a course back to the scene of the sinking that resulted in the captain's demise. This is a problem on two fronts. One, no one set a such a course, which leads many to surmise that the ghost of the captain is definitely onboard. Two, the damage to the submarine requires immediate repair, which won't happen if the crew can no longer steer the vessel. Oh dear. Does a ghost genuinely haunt the USS Tiger Shark? Or is a much more human cause at the heart of the weird goings on? It's to the film's credit that we can never say for sure exactly what causes these creepy incidents. One thing we do learn is that Brice and a few other crewmembers share a few secrets about what really happened to the sub's captain, secrets that will inevitably come to the surface (pun intended) as disaster looms on the horizon.I liked ""Below"" for several reasons. First, the performances are first rate. Greenwood gives a nuanced performance as Brice; it's a tricky role in that the actor can't suddenly turn into a raving maniac but must gradually reveal his character's mental deterioration. This Greenwood does effectively. Another welcome character is Weird Wally (Zach Galifianakis), who serves up necessary doses of comic relief whenever things get too weird on the submarine. Matthew Davis plays Ensign Odell, the obligatory hero character who eventually begins to question Brice's increasingly bizarre actions. ""Below"" also effectively uses CGI and sound effects to create a creepy atmosphere. And what an atmosphere! Think about it for a second--you can walk out of a haunted building, but where are you going to go when a spirit pops up on a submarine that risks attack if it surfaces? Exactly. About the only problem I had with the movie concerns the huge cast of characters. So many people step forward at various times that it is difficult in the extreme to keep track of them all. It's actually a small problem that fortunately doesn't interfere with the effectiveness of the movie.A commentary track with Twohy and a few cast members, deleted scenes, a making of feature, and trailers for ""Dracula 2002,"" ""Halloween: Resurrection,"" ""Tangled,"" and ""Undisputed"" round out the disc. While I don't think ""Below"" ranks as the best horror movie made in the last few years, I do think horror fans should pay it a visit. Fans of submarine films will probably want to give ""Below"" a watch too.",4,Creepiness fore and aft,1107907200,"02 9, 2005",2005,5424,"['When', 'heard', 'horror', 'movie', 'called', 'set',

There were many ways the plot could still go and nothing but atmosphere and build-up had taken place. Yet I became convinced that a lame obvious payoff was in my future. I was right.Below tells such a simple straightforward story that the histrionics throughout the film seem even more overblown in retrospect than during the viewing. The movie succeeds on some levels, it has a nice Pitch Black homage, very good special effects and set design and it does create a spooky atmosphere with sounds all around you and slamming door and flickering lights. (Director Twohy throws so many fright clich&eacute;s at you I'm surprised the submarine doesn't have a cat.)The downsides, besides the disastrous ending, are more plentiful. Bruce Greenwood, playing the acting skipper, comes across as more of a fishing charter captain than a sub commander in wartime. And Olivia Williams, as the rescued nurse, plays cold so well that I was rooting for the only piece of eye-candy in the whole film to die, disappear or at the very least shut up.All of this is a bit of a shame because take away the ghost story (and the endless bump in the night cheap scares that accompany it) you have yourself a pretty serviceable psychological thriller. On top of that the action scenes with the Germans attacking the sub are certainly tenser than any of the haunting stuff.Director Twohy would have been wise to dump the end and gone with a straightforward crippled World War 2 sub story.",3,Below...

591720,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JKWG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 5]","After being disappointed by so many thrillers &quot;Below&quot; benefited by exceeding expectations.  The 2002 film from director David Twohy (&quot;The Arrival&quot;) takes place during World War II and begins with the crew of the American submarine &quot;Tiger Shark&quot; picking up three survivors of a British hospital ship that has been torpedoed.  One of them is a nurse, Claire Paige (Olivia Wilson), whose presence aboard the boat is seen by some as signifying bad luck.  But it is clear that this sub already has been running on the down side since the depth of the captain.  The new commander, Lt. Brice (Bruce Greenwood) is jumpy, and apparently is telling the newcomers a story about the death of Captain Winter, and he is clearly not alone in hiding the truth about what really happened.  Right after the British are brought on board &quot;The Tiger Shark&quot; is attacked by a German ship, while makes Brice think that one of the three survivors in a collaborator.  Meanwhile, Ensign Douglas O'Dell (Matt Davis) is trying to make heads or tales out of everything that is going on, especially when things start to get creepy.It is easy to say that &quot;Below&quot; is a combination of a WWII submarine film and a ghost story, especially since that is a pretty interesting combination.  But one of the things that makes &quot;Below&quot; work better than most ghost stories is that the possibility of there being some other explanation is quite strong throughout the film.  One of the things that Twohy takes advantage of is the role that sound plays on a submarine where you can hear just about anything from whales singing to a Benny Goodman record that suddenly starts playing when the sub is engaged in silent running to a German depth charge bouncing along the outer hull (a marvelously affective sequence).  Add to that your traditional oxygen deprivation problems from being stuck in a confined place, and who knows what is really going on at any moment.Submarines are inherently claustrophobic environments and a submerged sub under attack is a natural for sweating inducing tension.  If anything Twohy studiously avoids going over the top, mixing up the touches of the supernatural with the various calamities that befall submariners, which you could say is erring on the side of caution.  As a result &quot;Below&quot; moves from being moody to being creepy, but without really getting terrifying.  Still, to be able to create and sustain a level of creepiness without the whole thing falling apart is pretty good in terms of contemporary horror movie standards.  The performances are notably on target across the board, especially  Nick Chinlund as the Chief, Jonathan Hartman as Schillings, and Christopher Fairbank as Pappy.  There is also a wonderful sequences where the crew explores the idea that the one thing that explains all the bizarre happenings is that they are already dead in what is one of the better &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; moments I have seen since the Zone shut down.Check out the deleted scenes because the second one, the &quot;Hot Fish&quot; sequence, would have been really interesting to work into the film, especially since Twohy claims in the commentary that this was a real nightmare of U.S. subs during World War II.  On that basic alone you have to wonder why they would have cut it, even though the explanation given (that it threatened to make &quot;Below&quot; seem like it was more of an action film than a thriller) makes sense.",4,A pretty good haunted submarine movie from David Twohy,1083110400,"04 28, 2004",2004,3489,"['being', 'disappointed', 'so', 'many', 'thrillers', 'quot', 'Below', 'quot', 'benefited', 'exceeding', 'expectations', '2002', 'film', 'director', 'David', 'Twohy', 'quot', 'Arrival', 'quot', 'place', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'crew', 'American', 'submarine', 'quot', 'Tiger', 'Shark', 'quot', 'picking', 'up', 'three', 'survivors', 'British', 'hospital', 'ship', 'been', 'torpedoed', 'One', 'nurse', 'Claire', 'Paige', 'Olivia', 'Wilson', 'presence', 'boat', 'seen', 'signifying', 'bad', 'luck', 'clear', 'sub', 'already', 'been', 'running', 'down', 'side', 'depth', 'captain', 'new', 'commander', 'Lt.', 'Brice', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'jumpy', 'apparently', 'telling', 'newcomers', 'story', 'death', 'Captain', 'Winter', 'clearly', 'not', 'alone', 'hiding', 'truth', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Right', 'British', 'are', 'brought', 'board', 'quot', 'Tiger', 'Shark', 'quot', 'attacked', 'German', 'ship', 'Brice', 'think', 'one', 'three', 'survivors', 'collaborator', 'Meanwhile', 'Ensign', 'Douglas', ""O'Dell"", 'Matt', 'Davis', 'trying', 'make', 'heads', 'tales', 'everything', 'going', 'especially', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'get', 'creepy.It', 'easy', 'say', 'quot', 'Below', 'quot', 'combination', 'WWII', 'submarine', 'film', 'ghost', 'story', 'especially', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'combination', 'one', 'things', 'quot', 'Below', 'quot', 'work', 'better', 'most', 'ghost', 'stories', 'possibility', 'being', 'other', 'explanation', 'quite', 'strong', 'film', 'One', 'things', 'Twohy', 'advantage', 'role', 'sound', 'plays', 'submarine', 'where', 'can', 'hear', 'just', 'anything', 'whales', 'singing', 'Benny', 'Goodman', 'record', 'suddenly', 'playing', 'when', 'sub', 'engaged', 'silent', 'running', 'German', 'depth', 'charge', 'bouncing', 'outer', 'hull', 'marvelously', 'affective', 'sequence', 'Add', 'traditional', 'oxygen', 'deprivation', 'problems', 'being', 'stuck', 'confined', 'place', 'who', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'moment.Submarines', 'are', 'inherently', 'claustrophobic', 'environments', 'submerged', 'sub', 'attack', 'natural', 'sweating', 'inducing', 'tension', 'anything', 'Twohy', 'studiously', 'going', 'top', 'mixing', 'up', 'touches', 'supernatural', 'various', 'calamities', 'befall', 'submariners', 'could', 'say', 'erring', 'side', 'caution', 'result', 'quot', 'Below', 'quot', 'moves', 'being', 'moody', 'being', 'creepy', 'really', 'getting', 'terrifying', 'Still', 'be', 'able', 'create', 'sustain', 'level', 'creepiness', 'whole', 'thing', 'falling', 'apart', 'pretty', 'good', 'terms', 'contemporary', 'horror', 'movie', 'standards', 'performances', 'are', 'notably', 'target', 'board', 'especially', 'Nick', 'Chinlund', 'Chief', 'Jonathan', 'Hartman', 'Schillings', 'Christopher', 'Fairbank', 'Pappy', 'also', 'wonderful', 'sequences', 'where', 'crew', 'idea', 'one', 'thing', 'bizarre', 'happenings', 'are', 'already', 'dead', 'what', 'one', 'better', 'quot', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'quot', 'moments', 'have', 'seen', 'Zone', 'shut', 'down.Check', 'out', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'second', 'one', 'quot', 'Hot', 'Fish', 'quot', 'sequence', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'interesting', 'work', 'film', 'especially', 'Twohy', 'claims', 'commentary', 'was', 'real', 'nightmare', 'U.S.', 'subs', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'basic', 'alone', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'would', 'have', 'cut', 'even', 'explanation', 'given', 'threatened', 'make', 'quot', 'Below', 'quot', 'seem', 'was', 'more', 'action', 'film', 'thriller', 'sense']",Below

591725,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00005JKWG,Martin Asiner,"[0, 1]","It is not often that Hollywood combines horror with war since the result is often to confuse the audience into blanching at the horrors of war or the horrors of the supernatural.  Each is horrible in its own right.  But in BELOW, director David Twohy creates a tale based on incremental images of fear.  During the second world war, an American submarine picks up three survivors of a U-boat sinking of a hospital ship.  One of the three is a woman who acts as a catalyst for the crew to re-examine the events that led to the recent death of the submarine's captain.  As the woman discovers the truth behind his death, so does the audience, and it is at this point that spooky things begin to occur. However, these spooky things are not all that spooky. One of them, at least is laughably derivative.  Fans of I LOVE LUCY will remember the scene in which she dresses as Harpo Marx with the real Harpo staring at her as if from a mirror.  Lucy mugs and bounces with Harpo trying to keep up, but always a milli movement off.  In BELOW, there is a similar scene in which a crewman peers into a smoky mirror with his reflection taking on a life of its own. For a film that is clearly meant to be bordering on the paranormal, this mirror scene is as spooky as it gets.  Yet, director Twohy manages to keep suspense flowing by virtue of the calamities that often beset submarines in war films. There is an abundance of noises, explosions, burst pipes, flooded compartments, and sailors cracking under pressure.  The ghost-like elements in BELOW could easily have been eliminated without sacrificing any attendant suspense. What emerges at the end is a confused ending to a military mission that on film at least is not nearly as spooky as both cast and crew had so clearly striven for.",3,BELOW: A Film of Images Not of Fear,1055635200,"06 15, 2003",2003,1779,"['not', 'often', 'Hollywood', 'combines', 'horror', 'war', 'result', 'often', 'confuse', 'audience', 'blanching', 'horrors', 'war', 'horrors', 'supernatural', 'horrible', 'own', 'right', 'BELOW', 'director', 'David', 'Twohy', 'tale', 'based', 'incremental', 'images', 'fear', 'second', 'world', 'war', 'American', 'submarine', 'up', 'three', 'survivors', 'U-boat', 'sinking', 'hospital', 'ship', 'One', 'three', 'woman', 'who', 'catalyst', 'crew', 're-examine', 'events', 'led', 'recent', 'death', 'submarine', 'captain', 'woman', 'truth', 'death', 'so', 'audience', 'point', 'spooky', 'things', 'begin', 'occur', 'However', 'spooky', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'spooky', 'One', 'least', 'laughably', 'derivative', 'Fans', 'LOVE', 'LUCY', 'will', 'remember', 'scene', 'Harpo', 'Marx', 'real', 'Harpo', 'staring', 'mirror', 'Lucy', 'mugs', 'bounces', 'Harpo', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'always', 'milli', 'movement', 'off', 'BELOW', 'similar', 'scene', 'crewman', 'smoky', 'mirror', 'reflection', 'taking', 'life', 'own', 'film', 'clearly', 'meant', 'be', 'bordering', 'paranormal', 'mirror', 'scene', 'as', 'spooky', 'director', 'Twohy', 'keep', 'suspense', 'flowing', 'virtue', 'calamities', 'often', 'beset', 'submarines', 'war', 'films', 'abundance', 'noises', 'explosions', 'burst', 'pipes', 'flooded', 'compartments', 'sailors', 'cracking', 'pressure', 'ghost-like', 'elements', 'BELOW', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'eliminated', 'sacrificing', 'attendant', 'suspense', 'What', 'end', 'confused', 'ending', 'military', 'mission', 'film', 'least', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'spooky', 'cast', 'crew', 'had', 'so', 'clearly', 'striven']",Below
591726,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B00005JKWG,Matthew King,"[4, 5]","Sometimes cinematic success moves in mysterious ways.  Take the case of ""Below"" for example.  Dimension films basically pulled the plug on the box office run of this movie despite the fact that it's one of the most refreshing thrillers in the last few years, all the while horrible fodder like ""scary movie 3"" rakes in piles of dough.  Even in video stores, ""Below"" has been a sadly overlooked film and I'll never understand why.  How a film like ""Ghost Ship"" receives twice the attention this one did is beyond comprehension. The talent involved in the making of this movie is undeniable, the script written by Darren Aronofsky (PI, Requiem for a dream) and the film directed by David Twohy who has now helmed several entertaing genre crossovers such as ""The Arrival"" and the two ""Pitch Black"" films.During world war II, a USS Tiger shark patrolling the Atlantic Ocean picks up the only three survivors of a torpedoed british hospital ship.  When the captain of the sub discovers that one of the three is a German he kills him immediately.  After this death, strange events begin to occur that lead the crew to believe that they might not be alone on the boat.  Not only do the USS crew have to deal with a sea full of German destroyers, but it appears that ghostly apparitions are haunting the USS Tiger Shark.This film is a combination of war story and horror-suspense thriller.  It's not easy to combine the two genres and the genius of this film is how the film takes a wild turn when you least expect it: You think you're watching a war movie and forget what's buried under it, a horror movie.  The film is deftly paced, and scares you in all the right moments.  This didn't seem to be made on a huge budget but that actually helps this movie, as the filmmakers were forced to focus on story, character development and suspense instead of mindless special FX extravaganza like so many of today's blockbuster pictures.  Like in ""Pitch Black"" the cast is filled with solid, relatively unknown actors who seem ready for a big breakthrough.  I thought the actors did a great job at creating a sense of isolation and panic and I really wanted to see them pull through.  It's that kind of empathy that often makes or breaks a horror film for me.  If I don't care about the characters, then I won't care who gets picked off one by one therefore diminishing the experience.This film is not without its flaws, although they do little to harm the picture.  First off, the notion that a trained crew of US soldiers could mistake a british ship for a German destroyer is absurd.  Second, the picture offers very little for war buffs to salivate on, as world war II is really more like a default setting.  The submarine Tiger Shark never existed and I've never read of any American submarines patrolling the Atlantic Ocean after July 1943.  So historically, the movie is complete fantasy but it must be beared in  mind that it was never intended as a historical war movie.  Reviewers who slam the film because of this are mising the point, as are those who try to place this movie on a measuring stick against ""Das Boot"".  I believe most people who did not enjoy this film were expecting too much from it, it should be taken as a suspense movie no more than that.

591730,A11S26M1MUM7O7,B00005JKWG,Neil Ford,"[5, 8]","'Below' is about a US submarine, patrolling the Atlantic during the Second World War, which picks up three survivors of a U-boat attack. Strange occurrences and mechanical failures begin to dog the crew, apparently linked to the recent death of the sub's commander, Captain Winters. The plot is an interesting twist on the standard ghost story, but contains a lot of stuff that will only be appreciated on repeat viewings. Since this movie sets itself up from the start as a popcorn flick, most of the target audience are unlikely to make the effort.This movie was a disappointment to people familiar with the previous work of its writer and director. Pitch Black (dir. Twohy) was an underrated minor sci-fi classic that improved with repeated viewing. Pi (dir. Aronofsky) was an amazing first film effort, moody, quirky and confident, and obviously the product of a unique artistic vision.  This film, unfortunately, seems to have combined the least talents of the writer and director, rather than the greatest.  (I am not addressing the contribution of the third screenwriter Sussman, simply because I am not familiar with his work, and it seems fair to guess that as he was one of three writers, his contribution amounts to only a third of the final script.)Who Are All These People?How many characters are there in this film? Seems like at least thirty, and they each get at least a couple of lines, and most of them seem to be scenery-chewers. As a result the movie is confusing, as the viewer doesn't know which characters and storylines are important, and which are just there as background. This is largely resolved at the beginning of the third act, when most of the crew is eliminated, but of the remainder there are still two or three actors who have not been differentiated enough for us to tell them apart.Stand Still, Damn It!One thing I found initially off-putting about Pitch Black was its rapid intercutting of visually rich shots (what used to be called MTV-style, before it became the norm for movies). In that film the style eased off after a while, but in Below it seems the director is genuinely afraid of using any shot that lasts for more than one second. As a result, you can _see_ what's on screen (if you don't blink), but you never get to _look_. The problem with this approach, particularly in this kind of film, is that the viewer is never allowed to be afraid of what _might_ happen on the screen, because there is _always_ something happening. There is always a jump cut, or hand-held camera work, or something jumping out at you. Instead of feeling as though you're stuck in a cramped tin can with thousands of tons of water pressing in on you, you're more likely to feel you're stuck in an editing suite with a hyperactive teenager.Oh, ""Boo"" YourselfAnother reason modern thrillers and horror movies aren't scary (he said, sounding older and grumpier by the minute) is the mechanical use of ""jolts"" and ""scares"". It's like a carnival ride: sure, it gets the heart pumping and produces an instinctive panic reaction, but it's purely mechanical, an automatic reaction. Your body is scared, but your mind and your emotions (unless you're pre-adolescent) remain untouched. Below is identical to other films of this genre in this respect. Things jump out or crash loudly at regular five minute intervals. Twohy actually reshot one of the earlier scenes because he felt it needed an extra scare. So now the cupboard looks spooky, and then some clothes fall out of it, but at this point in the film we don't even know that there's anything to be afraid of, so why should we care? More to the point, why should something jumping out at me in the final climactic sequence have any impact on me at all, when things have been going bang for no reason all the way through?I could write a long essay comparing Below with the recently released (at the time of this review) Starship Troopers 2, which explores similar situations and themes. The latter film, with a fraction of the budget, is the more successful, because it largely avoids the problems I have examined above. I guess the criticisms I've made could be applied to hundreds of movies made in the last decade, and perhaps I'm a fool to expect anything exceptional, but, in terms of directing and writing talent, this movie had the potential to be much more than the usual collection of trailer moments. Can Twohy escape from the ""Hollywood slick"" style in his next project? (edit: no) Would this film have been better if Twohy and Aronofsky had swapped roles? One thing I'll give them credit for: they didn't resort to the ""last gasp"" shock at the end - anyone else would've had Captain Winters suddenly launch himself out of the sea at the end of the last reel, just so the hero could put a couple of bullets in him or set him on fire or something... Thank heaven for small mercies.3 stars for technical achievement.(End note: When Claire Paige was snooping around the captain's cabin, was I the only one who said ""Hey, she must be the Nazi spy they're looking for""? And what _was_ all that stuff about the hydrogen? I didn't follow that at all.)",3,SUNK,1087430400,"06 17, 2004",2004,5128,"['US', 'submarine', 'patrolling', 'Atlantic', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'up', 'three', 'survivors', 'U-boat', 'attack',

591733,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B00005JKWG,OverTheMoon,"[4, 5]","To be honest even though Below is not anywhere near a 5 star movie, I am going to give it that special treatment because it is streaks and bounds ahead of horror films that are currently been made these days.Director David Twohy (Pitch Black) directs a script that Darren Aronofsky (Pi) has had his hand in to bring us a smart and downright frightening movie about a haunted submarine during WWII. Forget that pile of MTV Junk ""Ghost Ship"" and watch this vehicle instead.The story is a simple one but there are plenty of twists, plot and scares along the way. Basically a submarine called the Tiger Shark is given orders to head back the way it came to pick up survivors that are drifting in the sea. After they do, strange mysterious things start happening on board the submarine while at the same time it is trying to evade the detection of a German destroyer. As the story moves forward you start to learn that everybody is keeping some sort of a secret and that there is a connection between some crew members and the haunting. Bad guys turn good and good guys turn bad and as a suspense piece you never know what is going to happen next. There are plenty of times in the film when you genuinely want to cover your eyes, or hide behind the sofa.The other great thing about this movie is that it is crammed full of supporting actors in lead roles and you will have a lot of fun trying to put some of these faces to pictures that you have seen recently (Fight Club - Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels - Training Day... to name but a few.) The special effects are actually well done and even though a huge percentage of the special effects are CGI you will be hard pressed to notice it. In my opinion, this is a better submarine movie than the recent U-751 and a lot more suspense driven that I actually expected.It is odd that Dimension films did very little in way of actually promoting this film.

The ghost plot in the movie is nicely done, it doesn't rely on cgi effects of the ghost popping out of the crawlspace or killing the crew in gruesome ways but plays on their doubts and fears during their tour of duty on what they feel is a cursed ship.  There is of course another darker story of why the ghost is on the submarine and the dark secret some of the commanding officers are part of,  the suspense and action in the movie scenes is a nice touch as they play cat and dog with the ships that are tracking them throughout the ocean.  The cast of actors and one actress were incredible in their roles playing them well as you can almost feel their anxiety throughout the movie, and the way the cast play their roles almost makes you believe that this is how a real WW2 submarine crew would be like.  The video is incredibly clear and detailed no distortions to worry about and the audio was also very good throughout the movie, the extras sadly aren't much just a couple of trailers and an audio commentary from some of the actors.

Lighting was highly important.  The cast of relative unknowns got a chance to shine...mostly in roles dissimilar to any they had done before (Bruce Greenwood in a horror movie was new, I think.).  Banter and dialogue was fairly crisp, and a good sense of place was established.Having a horror movie (or at least a tale of the supernatural) set on a WWII submarine during wartime was pretty darn original.  The claustrophobic settings lend themselves well to this venture.  On a submarine, it always seems like nighttime.  Also, because we've all seen submarine movies before, we know how dangerous they are, how bad depth charges can be, etc. etc.  You just can't beat scenes of sweaty guys in T-shirts running around trying to slam those steel doors shut and turn the locks to prevent water from building up, etc.  These kinds of scenes are almost clich&eacute;s now  (actually, not ALMOST...they are).  But they work.The problem I have with BELOW is that we have what is essentially a 45 minute or 60 minute story stretched into over 90 minutes.  The story itself, the plot, is skimpy.  The ending, while a nice twist, isn't worth the wait.  I'm usually okay with slower pacing if it's in service of character or of understanding a situation better.  For example, to get WAY off track, the film ULEE'S GOLD is about a beekeeper.  It spends A LOT of time showing us the ins and outs of beekeeping.  This actually ends up informing our understanding of the actions Ulee takes later in the film.  In BELOW, the slow pace really only seems to stretch the story to movie length.  Lots of scenes seem repetitive or pointless.  We cover the same ground too many times.  The same arguments are made too many times.  (How many times CAN they force Olivia Williams back into her cabin!).Everyone is fine in the movie.  The story is original.  The cinematography, lighting and art direction are just swell.  But it simply is too threadbare to sustain real interest and involvement.  I liked BELOW okay...and everyone involved is obviously skilled...but I can't enthusiastically recommend it.One other note:  it is rated ""R.""  I'm not sure why?

I thought it was great - not as good as Pitch Black, but a different kind of movie so a comparison isn't really fair.At first you get the feeling that the movie can't decide what it wants to be - war? mystery? ghost story? horror? submarine hunt? Then you realize that it WANTS to be all those in one. And it does a very good job of being ALL of them.There are some excellent, VERY brief visuals in the movie that contribute to the sense of unease and otherworldly. It's the best representation ever of the feeling that you can only catch a glimpse of a ghost out of the corner of your eye.The sound design (as with just about any submarine movie) is excellent and story-critical. The acting is top-calibre from a relatively obscure cast (Bruce Greenwood, Olivia Williams, Matthew Davis, Holt McCallany, Scott Foley, Jason Flemyng, Nick Chinlund). The film is co-scripted by Darren Aronofsky (&quot;Pi&quot;, &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;). Director Twohy puts in a cameo appearance.The DVD exhibits one of the cleanest, clearest pictures I've ever seen (in my collection of 1000 DVDs). It rivals the transfer of a more obvious reference disc like &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;.

591755,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005JKWG,trebe,"[0, 0]","Director David Twohy (Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick) broaches several genres, in his unusual suspense thriller, Below (2002).  Part WW II submarine war adventure, part suspense thriller, and part horror film, Below features a supernatural presence aboard the American submarine Tiger Shark, on a mission in the north Atlantic in 1943.  It's an interesting blend, but one that doesn't totally satisfy in any particular area.Wartime movies featuring submarines, are often prone to clich&eacute;s, but this film largely avoids them, and introduces some new twists to the genre.  Falling depth charges, almost always mirror the course of the sub.  That is the case here, but there is a nice touch, where a depth charge tantalizingly bounces and rolls across the top of the sub, before falling over the side.  A new, scary ploy, is the use of hooks, to try and rip open or damage the hull.  This technique was actually used in the Pacific theater by the Japanese.  Also featured, is a trip to the void in between the inner pressure hull, and the outer sea hull.  Another doozy is an officer (Holt McCallany) exiting the sub, and trying to swim his way to the surface, before being harpooned.  But by far, the most dynamic development in Below, is the role that the buildup of hydrogen gas in the atmosphere plays.  In sudden dramatic fashion, the gas becomes responsible for the death of almost the entire crew!Nurse Claire Paige (Olivia Williams), and second mate Kingsley (Dexter Fletcher), are survivors from the British hospital ship Fort James, rescued by the Tiger Shark, after being hit by a torpedo.  A third survivor, a German, is shot dead by Lieutenant Brice (Bruce Greenwood) the sub's acting commanding officer.  Brice has taken command after the mysterious death of Captain Winters, who drowned while the ship was surfaced looking for survivors after a kill.Almost immediately strange things begin to happen, as a phonograph mysteriously blares out, causing a searching enemy destroyer to launch depth charges.  A crewman hears the corpse of the German speak to him.  Olivia, who has the propensity to stick her nose into everything, begins poking into the Captain's cabin and ship's log.  Then the destroyer is back, dragging the bottom with hooks, in another attempt to destroy the sub.  It's a very crowded ocean!Misfortune and weird incidents continue to occur, an officer (Scott Foley) dies, as events build to a climax.  The crew has lost control of the ship, and it is headed back to where the Fort James was sunk.  After the hydrogen disaster, most of the crew is dead, and much of the sub is in dire condition.  As the supernatural aspects come to the forefront, matters proceed to a dramatic conclusion.The whole vibe of Below, somehow doesn't ring true.  It makes for a nice drama, but the man don't seem to behave like real sailors, who understand and live by the military chain of command.  It's ridiculous, that there would be any tolerance for, any interference in the ship's operation by a civilian like Claire.  The ship's ensign (Matt Davis), engages in acts against command, conspiring with Claire and Kingsley.  Lt. Brice is also a piece of work, at times the headstrong commander, other times frozen and unable to act, forcing others to take action.  In the end, a nurse rises to superheroine status, while a shipfull of men with military training, look down, and search for their stones.  Dramatic yes, but is this realistic?Twohy successfully creates a film that is deeply atmospheric, and at times frightening.  The special effects, particularly those related to the submarine, are very nicely done, and the story features some incidents that are new to the genre.  The overdramatic aspects, mostly related to Claire, wear thin as time goes on, but she's the one designated to feed the fires of doubt.  After a long journey, the ending is rather weak, and a bit disillusioning, as Brice suddenly decides to surrender his command.  While Below deserves some credit for being ambitious in scope, by doing so, it becomes more open to criticism.  Unrealistic though it may be, Twohy's effort does have its moments.",4,there's some bad hoodoo on this boat . . .,1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,4152,"['Director', 'David', 'Twohy', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', 'several', 'genres', 'unusual', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'Below', '2002', 'Part', 'WW', 'II', 'submarine', 'war', 'adventure', 'part', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'part', 'horror', 'film', 'Below', 'supernatural', 'presence', 'American', 'submarine', 'Tiger', 'Shark', 'mission', 'north', 'Atlantic', '1943', 'interesting', 'blend', 'one', ""n't"", 'totally', 'satisfy', 'particular', 'area.Wartime', 'movies', 'featuring', 'submarines', 'are', 'often', 'prone', 'clich', 'eacute', 'film', 'largely', 'new', 'twists', 'genre', 'Falling', 'depth', 'charges', 'almost', 'always', 'mirror', 'course', 'sub', 'case', 'here', 'nice', 'touch', 'where', 'depth', 'charge', 'tantalizingly', 'bounces', 'rolls', 'top', 'sub', 'falling', 'side', 'new', 'scary', 'ploy', 'use', 'hooks', 'try', 'rip', 'open', 'damage', 'hull', 'technique', 'was', 'actually', 'used', 'Pacific', 'theater', 'Japanese', 'Also', 'featured', 'trip', 'void', 'inner', 'pressure', 'hull', 'outer', 'sea', 'hull', 'doozy', 'officer', 'Holt', 'McCallany', 'exiting', 'sub', 'trying', 'swim', 'way', 'surface', 'being', 'harpooned', 'far', 'most', 'dynamic', 'development', 'Below', 'role', 'buildup', 'hydrogen', 'gas', 'atmosphere', 'sudden', 'dramatic', 'fashion', 'gas', 'responsible', 'death', 'almost', 'entire', 'crew', 'Nurse', 'Claire', 'Paige', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'second', 'mate', 'Kingsley', 'Dexter', 'Fletcher', 'are', 'survivors', 'British', 'hospital', 'ship', 'Fort', 'James', 'rescued', 'Tiger', 'Shark', 'being', 'hit', 'torpedo', 'third', 'survivor', 'German', 'shot', 'dead', 'Lieutenant', 'Brice', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'sub', 'acting', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Brice', 'taken', 'command', 'mysterious', 'death', 'Captain', 'Winters', 'who', 'drowned', 'ship', 'was', 'surfaced', 'looking', 'survivors', 'kill.Almost', 'immediately', 'strange', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'phonograph', 'mysteriously', 'out', 'causing', 'searching', 'enemy', 'destroyer', 'launch', 'depth', 'charges', 'crewman', 'corpse', 'German', 'speak', 'Olivia', 'who', 'propensity', 'stick', 'nose', 'everything', 'poking', 'Captain', 'cabin', 'ship', 'log', 'Then', 'destroyer', 'back', 'dragging', 'bottom', 'hooks', 'attempt', 'destroy', 'sub', 'very', 'crowded', 'ocean', 'Misfortune', 'weird', 'incidents', 'continue', 'occur', 'officer', 'Scott', 'Foley', 'events', 'build', 'climax', 'crew', 'lost', 'control', 'ship', 'headed', 'back', 'where', 'Fort', 'James', 'was', 'sunk', 'hydrogen', 'disaster', 'most', 'crew', 'dead', 'much', 'sub', 'dire', 'condition', 'supernatural', 'aspects', 'come', 'forefront', 'matters', 'proceed', 'dramatic', 'conclusion.The', 'whole', 'vibe', 'Below', 'somehow', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'nice', 'drama', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'behave', 'real', 'sailors', 'who', 'understand', 'live', 'military', 'chain', 'command', 'ridiculous', 'would', 'be', 'tolerance', 'interference', 'ship', 'operation', 'civilian', 'Claire', 'ship', 'ensign', 'Matt', 'Davis', 'acts', 'command', 'conspiring', 'Claire', 'Kingsley', 'Lt.', 'Brice', 'also', 'piece', 'work', 'times', 'headstrong', 'commander', 'other', 'times', 'frozen', 'unable', 'act', 'forcing', 'others', 'take', 'action', 'end', 'nurse', 'rises', 'superheroine', 'status', 'shipfull', 'men', 'military', 'training', 'look', 'down', 'search', 'stones', 'Dramatic', 'yes', 'realistic', 'Twohy', 'successfully', 'film', 'deeply', 'atmospheric', 'times', 'frightening', 'special', 'effects', 'particularly', 'related', 'submarine', 'are', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'story', 'incidents', 'are', 'new', 'genre', 'overdramatic', 'aspects', 'mostly', 'related', 'Claire', 'wear', 'thin', 'time', 'one', 'designated', 'feed', 'fires', 'doubt', 'long', 'journey', 'ending', 'rather', 'weak', 'bit', 'disillusioning', 'Brice', 'suddenly', 'surrender', 'command', 'Below', 'credit', 'being', 'ambitious', 'scope', 'doing', 'so', 'more', 'open', 'criticism', 'Unrealistic', 'may', 'be', 'Twohy', 'effort', 'have', 'moments']",Below

591757,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JKWG,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[3, 3]","David Twohy is king of the b-movie thriller. He's directed a number of strong genre films on tight budgets that have been both visually innovative and startlingly powerful. The Arrival and Pitch Black are his two best known films and Below fits somewhere between the two of them. Visually, this haunted submarine story is about has sharp as they come. He's managed to inspire inspired performances from his under rated casts (everyone from Charlie Sheen and Vin Diesel have benefited from his solid direction).In this quick to video age, the art of B-movie making and low budget genre films had been lost until recently. The last director capable of creating anything worthwhile before Twohy was Sam Raimi. His Evil Dead films had a crackling energy and sense of humor most mainstream films would have benefited from in the 80's and 90's. Likewise, Twohy's films have all the visual splendor and energy missing from mainstream genre films over the last ten years. Minority Report and AI, for example, would have benefited from Twohy's action direction and lack of pretense. He tells a solid story and tells it well.It's a pity that Below was buried in the theaters before it got a chance to surface. The acting is top-notch and, while the script is certainly flawed, it's attempt at merging a variety of different genres is admirable.The DVD transfer is handsome and the extras extensive given the small audience the DVD was intended for. The sound is equally detailed and, while not presented in the DTS format, sounds great.
