1385872,A1URPQ4S8TJCR4,B0045W9D3E,Bert vanC Bailey,"[3, 3]","This is another case of the French charting daring paths with their film-making. Directed by St&eacute;phane Briz&eacute;, this one is all surfaces, subtle acting and poignant silences. To like it, you'll be best off if in the mood for a rhapsodic film that leans rather heavily on pregnant gazes and sharp guesswork.The sparse dialogue behind the story calls on inferring the characters' motives. The title's teacher (played by Sandrine Kiberlain) suffers from some unexplained previous damage - artistic and, likely, romantic disappointments - yet she remains open to a new venture. Vincent Lindon plays the man attracted to her, but with his own reasons - perhaps infidelity, 'though maybe also feeling outclassed - for his hesitation.That may seem apt when it's about this couple's gravitating towards the inevitable, since it provides your imagination with more than the usual amount of room to roam. When it comes to grasping how things come apart, the minimal dialogue makes understanding what's what rather less certain, which is another thing entirely.If you plan to see this, be ready for a lot of abstracted looks and Hesiodic hesitations, plus strains of Elgar's violin music and a romantic plot to bring them together. These and the director's use of silence to avoid being maudlin. After seeing it, I'd recommend a quiet restaurant and the company of someone special to puzzle out its appeal.",4,Romance rich with heavy silences,1365206400,"04 6, 2013",2013,1406,"['case', 'French', 'charting', 'daring', 'paths', 'film-making', 'Directed', 'St', 'eacute', 'Briz', 'eacute', 'one', 'surfaces', 'subtle', 'acting', 'poignant', 'silences', ""'ll"", 'be', 'best', 'mood', 'rhapsodic', 'film', 'rather', 'heavily', 'pregnant', 'gazes', 'sharp', 'guesswork.The', 'sparse', 'dialogue', 'story', 'inferring', 'characters', 'motives', 'title', 'teacher', 'played', 'Sandrine', 'Kiberlain', 'suffers', 'unexplained', 'previous', 'damage', 'artistic', 'likely', 'romantic', 'disappointments', 'yet', 'open', 'new', 'venture', 'Vincent', 'Lindon', 'man', 'attracted', 'own', 'reasons', 'perhaps', 'infidelity', 'maybe', 'also', 'feeling', 'outclassed', 'hesitation.That', 'may', 'seem', 'apt', 'when', 'couple', 'gravitating', 'inevitable', 'imagination', 'more', 'usual', 'amount', 'room', 'roam', 'When', 'grasping', 'how', 'things', 'come', 'apart', 'minimal', 'dialogue', 'understanding', 'what', 'what', 'rather', 'less', 'certain', 'thing', 'entirely.If', 'plan', 'see', 'be', 'ready', 'lot', 'abstracted', 'looks', 'Hesiodic', 'hesitations', 'strains', 'Elgar', 'violin', 'music', 'romantic', 'plot', 'bring', 'together', 'director', 'use', 'silence', 'avoid', 'being', 'maudlin', 'seeing', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'quiet', 'restaurant', 'company', 'someone', 'special', 'puzzle', 'out', 'appeal']",Mademoiselle Chambon

It had all of the elements; lots of emotions, passion, and romantic suspense. The plot was simple; an (apparently) happily married man with a devoted family falls for the attractive and somewhat mysterious village school teacher. The Chemistry is present and sets the stage for a story that could have gone in many directions. One could debate whether or not there was a happy ending. I personally thought that the ending was perfect and would not have wanted it to end in any other fashion. The background scenery of the small village and portrayal of the daily life of a French family was heartwarming. All of the characters were very decent people who were caught up in the emotions and challenges that life presents.Now, I need to find more good movies featuring the same actors and directors.

1385875,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B0045W9D3E,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[2, 3]","One of the highest compliments I can pay a movie is that, after watching it, I find it hard to watch other movies. I am a huge movie fan and such films are rare. ""Mademoiselle Chambon"" is that kind of a movie. After watching it, I couldn't watch any other film, so I just watched ""Mademoiselle Chambon"" again. ""Mademoiselle Chambon"" does the best job of any film I've ever seen at capturing one particular life experience.Some loves make sense and fit neatly into our life narratives. We fall in love with a person because we've had extended contact with that person. We know that he is of an appropriate age, social class, belief system, and occupation. We agree with this person on politics, music, and food. We have long talks with these rational loves, and share life events.Other loves are wildly irrational; they're like being overwhelmed by an invisible wind. We look across a crowded room, catch the eye of a complete stranger, and, within moments or hours, we know we are as in love as we will ever be. We're not in love because we've had a long conversation with this person and gotten to know them; we haven't. We're not in love because we've shared key life events; we have not. We don't decide on this type of love. It decides on us.With this love, every tiny detail, every evanescent nuance, silent moments when nothing is said, take on thunderous impact: her eyes move from the floor to his shoulder; her knees swing three inches toward his, his lips slightly part. Our hearts pound. We surrender to the full thrust of love, all of its physical and spiritual manifestations, and yet we know next to nothing concrete about the other person. Perhaps we never see that person again. Perhaps we exchange a few stolen kisses, or an afternoon of passion. Perhaps we connect forever; perhaps we say a heart-wrenching goodbye. ""Mademoiselle Chambon"" captures wordless, irrational love.Jean (Vincent Lindon) is a rumpled, paunchy, middle-aged construction worker. He is married to Anne-Marie, a factory worker. They have one son, Jeremy. Anne-Marie is hurt on the job and can't pick up Jeremy from school. Jean must go. There he encounters Mademoiselle Veronique Chambon (Sandrine Kiberlain) Jeremy's teacher. And Jean will never be the same.Jean and Anne-Marie have a few other meetings. Not much is said. Not much happens. A passer-by, carefully observing their encounters, would have no idea that he or she was witnessing an event that neither Jean nor Veronique will ever forget.Many ""slow"" movies bore me to tears. ""Mademoiselle Chambon"" is a ""slow"" movie and it never bored me. I came to understand that every line of dialogue, every apparently casual scene, is a minefield packed with meaning. In the opening scenes, Jean reveals his awkward inability to help his son with his homework. This prepares us for the story of an inarticulate construction worker who falls in love with a school teacher. The topic of his son's homework is the direct object - the object acted upon by the noun - or by fate. In a couple of scenes of Veronique's apartment, the viewer catches a glimpse of Bernini's statue of a helpless St. Teresa of Avila being pierced with an arrow of passion by a smiling cherub. St. Teresa is very much the direct object of that arrow, as are Jean and Veronique. Passion is beautiful and painful, life affirming and life threatening. Passion is both sexual and sacred. Jean is shown both tearing down, and putting up, walls. These walls are metaphorical as well as actual.Three scenes in this movie are as definitive a treatment of their subject matter as any scene in any film. In one, a musician plays music with her back to her audience. Before she begins, she turns around with a luminous look of vulnerability. In another, two people listen to a piece of music. I won't describe the third scene to you, because I don't want to give too much of the plot away, but if you see the film, you'll know what I mean.""Mademoiselle Chambon"" is not perfect. It is under-produced, in Dogme-95 style. Actors don't wear make-up; there's no professional lighting to speak of. ""Mademoiselle Chambon"" would have worked better for me with higher production values.I got to know Jean, but I was never sure of Veronique. I wanted to like her more than I did, to understand her very hard choices better, and to respect her choices more. Aure Atika is miscast. I never believed her as a factory worker, or as Jean's wife. And the ending struck me as incomplete and unsatisfying. I think the filmmaker wanted to make a movie that would ravish audiences emotionally. That he did. I wanted to have an intellectual understanding of how these events would play out in the future of the characters. I didn't get that from this movie, and I left it feeling that a sequel is necessary.Finally, of course this film is like the classic David Lean film, ""Brief Encounter"" starring Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson. I think that film gives the viewer more of a sense of the fullness of all the characters, and how the events shown during the film will play out in the characters' lives in the future. In short, to me, ""Brief Encounter"" felt more like a complete work of art.",4,Ravishing.

The film tries to push the differences between their classes as one of the obstacles but it does not come across as she has a kind of dis-association that transcends class / social rule book in any case. Somehow it is one of those films that you know the lovers will be doomed from the out-set.However,  rather than be a typical french film that analyses ordinary relationships in depth,  Mademoiselle Chambon bites off more than it can chew by putting Mademoiselle on a pedestal because she is An Artiste. Then proceeds to endow her with an excruciating sensitivity that threatened to derail the film towards the end. I was so annoyed that the film bombed from a 3 to  a 2 star rating because.....spoiler....? She is so goddam sensitive, she threatened to derail the film by sublimating her passion in her violin playing and leave him stranded with his d#%k in his hand and almost in tears.

Based on the novel by Eric Holder and adapted for the screen by Florence Vignon and director St&eacute;phane Briz&eacute;, this little miracle of a movie is what the French do best - understated appreciation for passing passion in a world of ordinary days.Jean (Vincent Lindon) is a construction worker happily married to Anne-Marie (Aure Atika) and adoring father of young son J&eacute;r&eacute;my (Arthur Le Hou&eacute;rou) and loving son of his retired builder father (Jean-Marc Thibault): he spends his hours away from his work tutoring his son with his wife and bathing his father's feet.  J&eacute;r&eacute;my's new schoolteacher is the very reserved but kind V&eacute;ronique Chambon (Sandrine Kiberlain, in life the wife of Vincent Lindon!) who requests that Jean speak to her class about his occupation as a builder - an assignment Jean is flattered to accept.  The presentation goes well and V&eacute;ronique hesitantly asks Jean to repair a window in her home.  Jean accepts the job (Anne-Marie thinks it is such a kind gesture that she asks Jean to invite V&eacute;ronique to lunch).  Jean replaces the window  for the quietly reserved and anxious V&eacute;ronique, and afterward Jean, noticing that V&eacute;ronique plays the violin, requests she play for him a 'tune'.  It is obvious that the peripatetic teacher is lonely, and it is also obvious that Jean is struck by the fact that a woman of education and musical talent would pay attention to a simple construction worker.  In a weak moment the two exchange a kiss and that kiss alters the manner in which each of these two gentle people react to life.  The results of this chance encounter play out in the conclusion of the story, a story so tender and yet so grounded in the realities of life that it takes the viewer by the heart and doesn't let go.The many varying moments of intimacy, whether those moments are between Jean and his son, Jean and his father, Jean and his wife, and Jean with Mademoiselle Chambon, are photographed like paintings by cinematographer Antoine H&eacute;berl&eacute;.  The entire cast is excellent and the performances by the five leading actors are superb. The musical score consists of original music by Ange Ghinozzi with a generous sampling of music by Sir Edward Elgar and others.  This frail bouquet of a film appreciates silence, the unspoken word, and the natural emotions of ordinary people living ordinary lives. It is a multifaceted treasure.

The movie's major sounds come, endlessly, loudly, from a construction worker drilling floors, crushing walls, fixing windows. The scenes alternate between the said construction worker, staring at the mademoiselle, and the mademoiselle, staring at the worker. How much can two people keep looking at each other, expressionlessly, without falling asleep, is probably the most impressive achievement of this movie. Excruciating!

1385886,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0045W9D3E,Turfseer,"[8, 20]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Another overrated French film comes down the pike! This time it's a slow moving little soap opera called Mademoiselle Chambon. Because it's quiet and understated, some people might mistake that for something profoundly emotional but in reality the characters are so paper thin, in the end we can't possibly care for them.The protagonist is Jean, a construction worker played by Vincent Lindon. He falls for Mademoiselle Veronique Chambon, a short-term contract schoolteacher played by Sandrine Kiberlain. Lindon and Kiberlain were married in real life but have subsequently separated. The film begins quite slowly as we are introduced to Jean, his wife Anne-Marie and their son, Jeremy. Veronique is Jeremy's teacher and she invites Jean to answer questions about his job before a class full of inquisitive elementary school students. Veronique then has a paying job for Jean as one of her window shutters is broken, so Jean comes over to fix it.You would think that Jean and Veronique have a lot to talk about like any normal people who are just getting to meet each other for the first time. But not so here in 'Mademoiselle Chambon'. One problem is that Jean appears to be depressed over his soulless marriage, so that prevents him from opening up. He does take an interest in her violin playing and finally convinces her to play a tune. Veronique offers to lend a bunch of CDs to Jean which feature the piece she has just played for him. Veronique also appears to be suffering from some kind of malaise and we find out little about her except for the fact that she usually only stays for a year or so before moving on to take other teaching jobs, in different parts of France.If Jean and Veronique seem a bit sketchy as characters, the supporting players have even less to do. Anne-Marie has one significant scene where she confronts Jean about being distant and there's also Jean's elderly father, who makes a short trip with his son to check out some caskets, anticipating his demise in a few years. As for Jeremy, his parents are seen helping him with his homework at the beginning of the film.If the characters are paper thin, the plot of 'Mademoiselle Chambon' is no different. Basically we're waiting until Jean decides to bed Veronique. He hesitates and at first communicates that he's unable to get physical because his wife has just informed him that she's pregnant with their second child. Veronique decides to give up her teaching job and go back to Paris after she concludes that Jean is tied up at home. She accepts Jean's invitation to play the violin at his father's 80th birthday party which is nice! But raging hormones cannot be contained and sure enough, the concupiscent couple ultimately hop in the sack right before the film's climax.In grand soap opera tradition, Veronique throws down the gauntlet and tells Jean in substance, 'put up or shut up'. Jean does show up at the train station (carrying a bag) and it appears he's about to join Veronique as she boards the train; but sure enough, Jean realizes he has commitments at home and is unable to honor his promise to go to Paris with Veronique.So ends the turgid 'Mademoiselle Chabon'. Don't get me wrong, it's a thoroughly watchable film and the acting and cinematography are fine. Nonetheless, nothing much happens; and when something does, it's something we've seen a thousand times before.",2,"Turgid, predictable soaper from France holds few surprises",1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,3413,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Another', 'overrated', 'French', 'film', 'down', 'pike', 'time', 'slow', 'moving', 'little', 'soap', 'opera', 'called', 'Mademoiselle', 'Chambon', 'quiet', 'understated', 'people', 'might', 'mistake', 'something', 'profoundly', 'emotional', 'reality', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'paper', 'thin', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'care', 'them.The', 'protagonist', 'Jean', 'construction', 'worker', 'played', 'Vincent', 'Lindon', 'Mademoiselle', 'Veronique', 'Chambon', 'short-term', 'contract', 'played', 'Sandrine', 'Kiberlain', 'Lindon', 'Kiberlain', 'were', 'married', 'real', 'life', 'have', 'subsequently', 'separated', 'film', 'quite', 'slowly', 'are', 'introduced', 'Jean', 'wife', 'Anne-Marie', 'son', 'Jeremy', 'Veronique', 'Jeremy', 'teacher', 'Jean', 'answer', 'questions', 'job', 'class', 'full', 'inquisitive', 'elementary', 'school', 'students', 'Veronique', 'then', 'paying', 'job', 'Jean', 'one', 'window', 'shutters', 'broken', 'Jean', 'fix', 'it.You', 'would', 'think', 'Jean', 'Veronique', 'have', 'lot', 'talk', 'normal', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'getting', 'meet', 'other', 'first', 'time', 'not', 'so', 'here', ""'Mademoiselle"", 'Chambon', 'One', 'problem', 'Jean', 'be', 'depressed', 'soulless', 'marriage', 'prevents', 'opening', 'up', 'take', 'interest', 'violin', 'playing', 'finally', 'play', 'tune', 'Veronique', 'lend', 'bunch', 'CDs', 'Jean', 'feature', 'piece', 'just', 'played', 'Veronique', 'also', 'be', 'suffering', 'kind', 'malaise', 'find', 'out', 'little', 'except', 'fact', 'usually', 'only', 'year', 'so', 'moving', 'take', 'other', 'teaching', 'jobs', 'different', 'parts', 'France.If', 'Jean', 'Veronique', 'seem', 'bit', 'sketchy', 'characters', 'supporting', 'players', 'have', 'even', 'less', 'do', 'Anne-Marie', 'one', 'significant', 'scene', 'where', 'Jean', 'being', 'distant', 'also', 'Jean', 'elderly', 'father', 'who', 'short', 'trip', 'son', 'check', 'out', 'caskets', 'anticipating', 'demise', 'few', 'years', 'Jeremy', 'parents', 'are', 'seen', 'helping', 'homework', 'beginning', 'film.If', 'characters', 'are', 'paper', 'thin', 'plot', ""'Mademoiselle"", 'Chambon', 'different', 'Basically', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'Jean', 'bed', 'Veronique', 'first', 'communicates', 'unable', 'get', 'physical', 'wife', 'just', 'informed', 'pregnant', 'second', 'child', 'Veronique', 'give', 'up', 'teaching', 'job', 'go', 'back', 'Paris', 'Jean', 'tied', 'up', 'home', 'Jean', 'invitation', 'play', 'violin', 'father', '80th', 'birthday', 'party', 'nice', 'raging', 'hormones', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'contained', 'sure', 'enough', 'concupiscent', 'couple', 'ultimately', 'hop', 'sack', 'right', 'film', 'climax.In', 'grand', 'soap', 'opera', 'tradition', 'Veronique', 'down', 'gauntlet', 'tells', 'Jean', 'substance', ""'put"", 'up', 'shut', 'up', 'Jean', 'show', 'up', 'train', 'station', 'carrying', 'bag', 'join', 'Veronique', 'train', 'sure', 'enough', 'Jean', 'commitments', 'home', 'unable', 'honor', 'promise', 'go', 'Paris', 'Veronique.So', 'turgid', ""'Mademoiselle"", 'Chabon', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'thoroughly', 'watchable', 'film', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'are', 'fine', 'Nonetheless', 'nothing', 'much', 'when', 'something', 'something', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thousand', 'times', 'before']",Mademoiselle Chambon
1385887,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0045W9D3E,Z Hayes,"[20, 21]","Movies like Mademoiselle Chambon restores my faith in modern cinema. I had about enough of insipid romance dramas that lack any true emotion and appear contrived. When this movie title popped up as a recommended watch on Netflix, I thought I'd give it a try. This is one of those movies that stay with you long after the credits have rolled. It will appeal to those who appreciate a narrative that unfolds at leisure, taking its time to develop the characters, where there may appear to be too many long scenes of nothing much happening, but everything is done in a manner so as to convey the very real emotions experienced by the main characters.The story centers on Jean (Vincent Lindon), a happily-married family man whose life is devoted to work (in construction) and his family, consisting of his wife Anne-Marie (Aure Atika), who works in a factory, their young son Jeremy (Arthur Le Houerou), and Jean's aging father. Everything seems to be clicking along fine, though the viewer senses life for Jean has settled into an all too familiar and monotonous rhythm. When Jean goes to pick up his son from school one afternoon, he meets Jeremy's teacher, willowy, sad-looking Veronique Chambon (Sandrine Kiberlain). She asks if Jean would be kind enough to talk to the children about his work, and he hesitantly agrees. During the presentation, one senses some sort of attraction developing between the two, and this attraction develops when Jean agrees to fix Veronique's broken window. It is at her apartment that Jean discovers Veronique's talent for playing the violin, and the haunting strains of her playing, with her back to Jean, cements the strong attraction between the two. Despite the social differences between the two, this developing romance is credible given that Jean senses Veronique's loneliness, and Veronique in turn sees a strong, gentle man in Jean. Both are also connected by their common love of music.However, these are two decent people, caught in a difficult situation - how are they to act on their natural impulses and give in to their undeniable attraction for each other when Jean is married to a kind, loving woman and has a son to provide for? This movie explores not only the theme of forbidden love, but also of the choices individuals make and the consequences they live with. It reminded me ofFalling in Lovewith Robert de Niro and Meryl Streep, but this is far superior in its execution.The two leads are compelling in their portrayal of the quiet Jean and shy Veronique - there is a haunting quality to both performances that had me riveted to the screen the entire time. Even mundane scenes, like when Jean is bricking up a wall is significant as it shows Jean's torment and struggle within himself. There are many such scenes in this movie - slow, unfolding, tender moments that just stay within your heart and leave indelible impressions on one's mind. The soundtrack is also beautiful - the strains on the violin and the mesmerizing voice of the singer at the end went perfectly with the final, memorable scene. A beautiful, lyrical movie that I will not soon forget.",5,"Heartbreaking and beautiful, a cinematic gem",1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,3112,"['Movies', 'Mademoiselle', 'Chambon', 'faith', 'modern', 'cinema', 'had', 'enough', 'insipid', 'romance', 'dramas', 'lack', 'true', 'emotion', 'appear', 'contrived', 'When', 'movie', 'title', 'popped', 'up', 'recommended', 'watch', 'Netflix', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'try', 'one', 'movies', 'stay', 'long', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled', 'will', 'appeal', 'who', 'appreciate', 'narrative', 'leisure', 'taking', 'time', 'develop', 'characters', 'where', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'long', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'much', 'happening', 'everything', 'done', 'manner', 'so', 'convey', 'very', 'real', 'emotions', 'experienced', 'main', 'characters.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Jean', 'Vincent', 'Lindon', 'happily-married', 'family', 'man', 'life', 'devoted', 'work', 'construction', 'family', 'consisting', 'wife', 'Anne-Marie', 'Aure', 'Atika', 'who', 'factory', 'young', 'son', 'Jeremy', 'Arthur', 'Le', 'Houerou', 'Jean', 'aging', 'father', 'Everything', 'be', 'clicking', 'along', 'fine', 'viewer', 'life', 'Jean', 'settled', 'too', 'familiar', 'monotonous', 'rhythm', 'When', 'Jean', 'pick', 'up', 'son', 'school', 'one', 'afternoon', 'Jeremy', 'teacher', 'willowy', 'sad-looking', 'Veronique', 'Chambon', 'Sandrine', 'Kiberlain', 'Jean', 'would', 'be', 'kind', 'enough', 'talk', 'children', 'work', 'hesitantly', 'presentation', 'one', 'sort', 'attraction', 'developing', 'two', 'attraction', 'when', 'Jean', 'fix', 'Veronique', 'broken', 'window', 'apartment', 'Jean', 'Veronique', 'talent', 'playing', 'violin', 'haunting', 'strains', 'playing', 'back', 'Jean', 'strong', 'attraction', 'two', 'social', 'differences', 'two', 'developing', 'romance', 'credible', 'given', 'Jean', 'Veronique', 'loneliness', 'Veronique', 'turn', 'strong', 'gentle', 'man', 'Jean', 'are', 'also', 'connected', 'common', 'love', 'music.However', 'are', 'two', 'decent', 'people', 'caught', 'difficult', 'situation', 'how', 'are', 'act', 'natural', 'impulses', 'give', 'undeniable', 'attraction', 'other', 'when', 'Jean', 'married', 'kind', 'loving', 'woman', 'son', 'provide', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'theme', 'forbidden', 'love', 'also', 'choices', 'individuals', 'make', 'consequences', 'live', 'reminded', 'ofFalling', 'Lovewith', 'Robert', 'de', 'Niro', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'far', 'superior', 'execution.The', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'compelling', 'portrayal', 'quiet', 'Jean', 'shy', 'Veronique', 'haunting', 'quality', 'performances', 'had', 'riveted', 'screen', 'entire', 'time', 'Even', 'mundane', 'scenes', 'when', 'Jean', 'bricking', 'up', 'wall', 'significant', 'Jean', 'torment', 'struggle', 'are', 'many', 'such', 'scenes', 'movie', 'slow', 'unfolding', 'tender', 'moments', 'just', 'stay', 'heart', 'leave', 'indelible', 'impressions', 'one', 'mind', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'beautiful', 'strains', 'violin', 'mesmerizing', 'voice', 'singer', 'end', 'went', 'perfectly', 'final', 'memorable', 'scene', 'beautiful', 'lyrical', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'soon', 'forget']",Mademoiselle Chambon
