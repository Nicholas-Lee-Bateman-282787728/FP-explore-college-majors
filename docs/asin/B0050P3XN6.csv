When I finally got a chance to buy the DVD and see it again, I was somewhat disappointed. The opening and closing scenes are really dramatic, but a lot of the rest is pretty bad.

Gann).Nevertheless some really good actors give some bad performances here, and some of the lines poor Glenn Ford has to say are laughable.So, *sigh*, another childhood memory bites the dust.

Can a person maintain faith in the ability of another when all else says otherwise.  This is a detective story of sorts. First, what caused the crash of the airliner?

1435622,A37SFXAWN1CXO0,B0050P3XN6,"Doug Danzeisen ""frankfan42""","[0, 0]","This is a great movie from the early days when jets were relatively new. The aircraft intentionally does not resemble any production craft, I read that the producers did not wish to offend any of the aircraft manufacturers. At any rate- the pilot, Rod Taylor, has a colorful past full of play boying and brash exploits. Soon after take off an engine explodes and is shut down, leaving one engine to support the plane. This is does, although the emergency return to the field, due to unexpectedly heavy traffic, proves fatal as the remaining engine fire warning light goes on. The aircraft is set down on a beach and lands well, until it encounters a pier, which was to have been removed the week before.Glenn Ford is wonderful as the airline exec who knew Captain Savage during WWII and flew with him. He doubts pilot error and makes it his mission to reveal the truth, despite the fact that the other execs seem rather eager to throw Savage ""Under the Bus,"" when it is revealed he was seen in a bar shortly before take off. Ford investigates this allegation and learns a lot about the man he thought he knew for years. He finds that beneath the exterior was a sensitive and caring man, who, while seemingly carefree and happy go lucky, actually was an intense and serious man who cared deeply for people.Beginning as an airplane disaster movie we are quickly caught up in a human drama that pulls us in to discover the truth, and that sometimes one must look beneath the surface, and that things sometimes turn on a seemingly insignificant and trivial event. Such is the stuff of life, and of great movies.The matter comes to a head when Ford, also a pilot, takes an identical plane and attempts to recreate the circumstances of the accidnet when.... Well, you gotta watch the movie for that.Interestingly, the pilot author of the book, Ernest K Gann, wanted to dissociate himself from the movie as it was not true to his book. Having also read his book, which was very different, I find that the movie stands well on its own merits. Highly recommended.The only issue I had with the movie was in logic. I have talked with a couple professional pilots and they would never shut off the last functional engine on an aircraft, even if the fire light was on. Aside from that though this movie is well thought out, moving and makes one think about what matters. These are seldom seen on the cinema of today, so I give this five stars as great entertainment. I do subtract one star due to the high price listed- $39.99.

""A personal comment :I've been pronounced dead twice by doctors and came back, was paralyzed in a car accident and came back from it, have almost died twice from pneumonia and came back from nearly dying and I firmly believe in the fact that something things are destined to be and are immutable yet others can be changed by our decisions or the decisions and actions of others. I also firmly believe that we all choose the paths that we take in this life but that there are alternate timelines. I've also had experiences that allowed me to look into the past on 3 separate occasions. My Mother and I are both psychic. She's very intuitive and knows when people in our family are ill, even when they're thousands of miles away. Myself, I know when events are going to happen but can't quite put my finger on it. Her skills are more attuned to it than I am. But I have had the spirits of relatives, friends and pets come back to me as has she. Our lives do not just stop when we die but continue on some plane. In other realities, I'm not alive. In others, I finished law school went into the Air Force, etc. My current home is haunted by several pets who periodically show that they still know how much I miss them.That's what this movie is all about. A series of events that happen, some trivial in nature but all leading up to a disaster, yet could not be avoided because it was meant to be by the hand of fate.I saw this movie in the theatre when it came out on first run. It used to be on tv a lot then suddenly nothing.Fate is STILL moving its long hand, thus this comment from Film Score Monthly :Posted:  Jan 5, 2011 - 5:15 PMBy:  George Komar  (Member)FATE IS THE HUNTER is fairly ridiculous in it's aviation aspects, despite being based on (a small part of) a novel by Ernest K. Gann who wrote ISLAND IN THE SKY and THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY, yet it works on an emotional level because of the hard working cast and Goldsmith's spare, mournful score...Ridiculous was the word I used when I thought about the film's premise last night... only to wake up to the news -- equally ridiculous -- that spilled coffee forced a United Airlines jet to make an emergency landing -- in the year 2011, some 47 years after the film's release.Goldsmith also scored the music for another of Gann's literary works: MASADA (based on Gann's ""The Antagonists"").I give the film 5 stars but only rank this release 4 stars because of the excessive price, just like when M Squad came out for $ 79.95 which was /is also outrageous. The price has dropped considerably since then.Its one of the lost air disaster type films which backtracks to find out what happened when all of the people on the plane are dead save one.I've had a copy I got on Ebay from its running on the Mystery channel years ago.A great cast, an interesting score ( which is now available on cd by the great Jerry Goldsmith ) and a film which everyone should see just once if you want to get some idea of how they reconstruct aircraft after a crash and how they try to determine who's at fault, but all too often they try to blame it on dead pilots.I just wish the price wasn't so expensive. But I will be getting this one as soon as I can.The character actors in this film are worth it just for that if nothing else.And you get to see Wally Cox without his glasses and looking incredibly young too !:)And Suzanne Pleshette who was also so sexy and is missed as are many in the cast including Ford, Persoff, Cox, Stanley Adams ( if memory serves, he played the trader in OST : The Trouble With Tribbles.Now if they'd only release Rod Taylor's Travis McGee film Darker Than Amber on DVD, which has probably the bloodiest fight scene in film history and one where both actors injured themselves in filming it and the villain in the piece actually broke his leg !",4,Why do these movies have to be so expensive & reminiscing ...,1367798400,"05 6, 2013",2013,4209,"['[', ']', 'Why',

1435633,A20SO3O9ODU8KF,B0050P3XN6,"Laurence G. Cripe ""ScriptMaverick""","[47, 51]","Very loosely based on the book by international flying and sailing expert, Ernest K. Gann, Fate is the Hunter has finally been captured on dvd in a pristine format with excellent, distortion-free video and audio components - the audio track is captured separately as an extra feature.  The story follows the character of Jack Savage - playboy, adventurer, and a seat-of-the-pants pilot - ably portrayed by the venerable Rod Taylor.  Following a fatal passenger plane crash in which the tragic pilot is singled out as the cause, the story is told in a series of flashbacks that attempt to restore the unfortunate and voiceless victim.  Saddled with the investigation and the ultimate reconstruction of the crash, is airline executive Sam McBane, wonderfully and capably played by Glenn Ford.  McBane flew with Savage in the past and understands his complex character - he knows that Savage was a man of compassion - who wanted to help and not hurt.As the dead pilot is continually villified via media crucifixtion, we are introduced to the many people who interacted with him.  Wally Cox, Suzanne Pleshette, Nehemiah Persoff, Nancy Kwan, Dorothy Malone, Mark Stevens, Robert F. Simon, Robert J. Wilke, Jane Russell, and a stand-up cast of some of the finest character actors in Hollywood help to make this semi-documentary as real as the headlines.  Passenger aviation had reached an apex in the mid-sixties - the demand for air travel had reached a tipping point and the new jet technology was venturing into areas that were fraught with unforgiving situations - each crash provided information that was part of a continuing evolution of hard and costly lessons that have slowly led to one of the safest modes of transportation.In a form of life imitating art, the crash of a twin-engined 737-400 in Kegworth, England in 1989 - Flight 92 - involved the misidentification of a malfunctioning engine - the crew decided to shut off the fully functioning engine - the aircraft subsequently crashed with a tragic loss of life.  In 2009, U.S. Airways Flight 1549 sustained bird strikes rendering both engines inoperable.  The flight crew, led by Captain Chesley Sullenberger III, made split second decisions that ended with the unpowered aircraft gliding into the Hudson River without a loss of life.As an accident reconstructionist, I can say that this movie and ""No Highway in the Sky"" were factors in my early interest in crash interpretation and analysis.  And, yes - it's easy to speculate that the dead operator was the sole cause of an accident - but proper reconstruction techniques allow for highly advanced evaluations of causal factors. While attending a seminar at the NTSB Training Center in Ashburn, Virginia, I finally decided to take a tour of the TWA Flight 800 remains that are sequestered in the basement/hanger. 230 passengers and crew perished in that controversial disaster in 1996. As I solemnly examined the elaborate patch-work reconstruction of the fuselage, I couldn't help but think back to ""Fate is the Hunter"".It is welcome to see Twilight Time enter the DVD production world.
