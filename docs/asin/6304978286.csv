442216,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,6304978286,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[1, 2]","Recently, for some unknown reason, I decided to dig up some old VHS tapes that I had not seen in years (Some I have not watched in at least ten years). So I dug fifteen old animated films that I grew up with as a kid to see if they still held up. So the first film I watched was this. I researched a little bit about before I went back into watching it, and was left wondering, ""Why do so many people piss all over this film?"" Although the majority of critics were in favor of the film when it released in 1985 (62% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), there were a good number of critics and moviegoers who bashed the hell out of this film because for them, it was either ""too dark"" or ""boring."" This film deserved so much more than what it got. It bombed in theaters, and was not released on video until 1998. Surprisingly, among the film's supporters was Roger Ebert (Who I will never forgive for some of his opinions on a good number of films) who gave the film a 3.5 out of 4-star rating and addressed the complaints among people that it was too dark by using past Disney classics which had plenty of grim moments and weren't so happy-go-lucky and said that it was a return to its roots. This is one of Disney's more bold efforts, and you don't see these kinds of efforts anymore (Instead we're condemned to endless High School Musical sequels, Disney Channel, numerous straight-to-DVD sequels, and plenty of other mind-blowingly awful films). I implore you, give this film a chance. Watch it with your kids though, because it is a pretty grim and creepy film, but it is a superb film.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The story about the black cauldron details that many centuries ago, there was a king who was so evil and so powerful, that even the gods feared him, so he was thrown into a black cauldron, which, if found by the right user will unleash an army of the undead upon the world and there is almost no way to stop whoever wields it except for a sacrifice of a good person's soul. We are then introduced to Taran, a wannabe knight who constantly day dreams about it which annoys Dallben, the man who takes care of him. Unfortunately, Taran is a pig-keeper for a pig named Henwin, who has special powers that can see into the future and reveal other things as well. When Henwin randomly freaks out as Taran is giving her a bath, she is brought inside the house where it is revealed to Taran that this pig has special powers, and she reveals that the villain in this film; The Horned King; is after the black cauldron, and then during the vision, it is discovered that The Horned King knows about this pig and Taran is forced to flee with Henwin to a safe place. But unfortunately during a day dream, Henwin wanders away from him and he sets out to go and find her. Then he meets a strange, furry creature named Gurgi who steals his apple and then wanders away. When Taran finds Henwin, she is being chased by dragons from The Horned King and is taken away to the castle. So Taran goes to the castle and manages to set her free, but is captured and put in a dungeon. During his brief period in the prison, he meets a girl named Princess Eilonwy who helps him and a man named Fflewddur Fflam (Who has a magical harp that criticizes him  by busting strings) escape from the castle in an epic fashion. Then the true crazy adventure of Taran, Eilonwy, Gurgi, and Fflewddur beings as they try and find the black cauldron before the king does and prevent him from capturing them.MUSIC: The music is bizarre, yet it fits this crazy fantasy film. It was very enjoyable to listen to, and at the same time it could be pretty creepy.ACTION: This film is spectacle and is rather violent as well which makes it certainly earn its hard PG-rating. This film was never dull in this area and was rather spectacular.ACTING: This is the area in which the film loses the potential perfect rating. While the actors are good for the most part, there are moments when they slip up or there's some corny dialogue. However, the good outweighs the bad in this area, and these actors do a very respectable job at their roles.OVERALL: If you're tired of the crap that Disney is putting out these days (Please don't remind me of Chicken Little or Meet the Robinsons). This film is very good and superb. It is one of Disney's darker and more bold efforts and it succeeds very well at it. Don't let the kids watch it alone though, this film can be pretty violent and creepy.THE GOOD: Wonderful animation, good acting, cool action scenes, an enthralling story, wonderful characters, and it's actually kind of creepy.THE BAD: Moments of cheesy acting and dialogue.",5,A BRILLIANT ANIMATED FILM THAT DESERVED SO MUCH MORE  9.5 OUT OF 10,1254355200,"10 1, 2009",2009,4619,"['Recently', 'unknown', 'reason', 'decided', 'dig', 'up', 'old', 'VHS', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'years', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'least', 'ten', 'years', 'dug', 'fifteen', 'old', 'animated', 'films', 'grew', 'up', 'kid', 'see', 'still', 'held', 'up', 'first', 'film', 'watched', 'was', 'researched', 'little', 'bit', 'went', 'back', 'watching', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'Why', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'piss', 'film', 'majority', 'critics', 'were', 'favor', 'film', 'when', 'released', '1985', '62', '%', 'Fresh', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'were', 'good', 'number', 'critics', 'moviegoers', 'who', 'bashed', 'hell', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'dark', 'boring', 'film', 'deserved', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'got', 'bombed', 'theaters', 'was', 'not', 'released', 'video', '1998', 'Surprisingly', 'film', 'supporters', 'was', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'Who', 'will', 'never', 'forgive', 'opinions', 'good', 'number', 'films', 'who', 'gave', 'film', '3.5', '4-star', 'rating', 'addressed', 'complaints', 'people', 'was', 'too', 'dark', 'using', 'past', 'Disney', 'classics', 'had', 'plenty', 'grim', 'moments', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'happy-go-lucky', 'said', 'was', 'return', 'roots', 'one', 'Disney', 'more', 'bold', 'efforts', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'kinds', 'efforts', 'anymore', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'condemned', 'endless', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'sequels', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'numerous', 'straight-to-DVD', 'sequels', 'plenty', 'other', 'mind-blowingly', 'awful', 'films', 'implore', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'Watch', 'kids', 'pretty', 'grim', 'creepy', 'film', 'superb', 'film.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'story', 'black', 'cauldron', 'details', 'many', 'centuries', 'ago', 'was', 'king', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'evil', 'so', 'powerful', 'even', 'gods', 'feared', 'was', 'thrown', 'black', 'cauldron', 'found', 'right', 'user', 'will', 'unleash', 'army', 'undead', 'world', 'almost', 'way', 'stop', 'whoever', 'sacrifice', 'good', 'person', 'soul', 'are', 'then', 'introduced', 'Taran', 'wannabe', 'knight', 'who', 'constantly', 'day', 'Dallben', 'man', 'who', 'care', 'Unfortunately', 'Taran', 'pig-keeper', 'pig', 'named', 'Henwin', 'who', 'special', 'powers', 'can', 'see', 'future', 'reveal', 'other', 'things', 'well', 'When', 'Henwin', 'randomly', 'out', 'Taran', 'giving', 'bath', 'brought', 'house', 'where', 'revealed', 'Taran', 'pig', 'special', 'powers', 'villain', 'film', 'Horned', 'King', 'black', 'cauldron', 'then', 'vision', 'discovered', 'Horned', 'King', 'pig', 'Taran', 'forced', 'flee', 'Henwin', 'safe', 'place', 'unfortunately', 'day', 'dream', 'Henwin', 'away', 'out', 'go', 'find', 'Then', 'strange', 'furry', 'creature', 'named', 'Gurgi', 'who', 'apple', 'then', 'wanders', 'away', 'When', 'Taran', 'Henwin', 'being', 'chased', 'dragons', 'Horned', 'King', 'taken', 'away', 'castle', 'Taran', 'castle', 'manages', 'set', 'free', 'captured', 'put', 'dungeon', 'brief', 'period', 'prison', 'girl', 'named', 'Princess', 'Eilonwy', 'who', 'man', 'named', 'Fflewddur', 'Fflam', 'Who', 'magical', 'harp', 'busting', 'strings', 'escape', 'castle', 'epic', 'fashion', 'Then', 'true', 'crazy', 'adventure', 'Taran', 'Eilonwy', 'Gurgi', 'Fflewddur', 'beings', 'try', 'find', 'black', 'cauldron', 'king', 'prevent', 'capturing', 'them.MUSIC', 'music', 'bizarre', 'crazy', 'fantasy', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'listen', 'same', 'time', 'could', 'be', 'pretty', 'creepy.ACTION', 'film', 'spectacle', 'rather', 'violent', 'well', 'certainly', 'hard', 'PG-rating', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'dull', 'area', 'was', 'rather', 'spectacular.ACTING', 'area', 'film', 'potential', 'perfect', 'rating', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'slip', 'up', 'corny', 'dialogue', 'However', 'good', 'bad', 'area', 'actors', 'do', 'very', 'respectable', 'job', 'roles.OVERALL', ""'re"", 'tired', 'crap', 'Disney', 'putting', 'days', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'remind', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'superb', 'one', 'Disney', 'darker', 'more', 'bold', 'efforts', 'very', 'well', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'kids', 'watch', 'alone', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'violent', 'creepy.THE', 'GOOD', 'Wonderful', 'animation', 'good', 'acting', 'cool', 'action', 'scenes', 'enthralling', 'story', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'actually', 'kind', 'creepy.THE', 'BAD', 'Moments', 'cheesy', 'acting', 'dialogue']",The Black Cauldron Disney's Masterpiece  VHS

There's some good dialog with fairly authentic English accents, but all characters' mannerisms from the books were dropped, resulting in some boring word exchanges.

442222,A1Z0K3LNNGE24M,6304978286,"Amazon Customer ""Ro""","[1, 1]","Recently my husband and I were discussing the Disney movies we grew up with, so I was searching out the ones we didn't own and found The Black Cauldron for a good price ($12 with Prime). He'd never seen it, so I ordered it.Both of us have read the Prydain series of books by Lloyd Alexander, multiple times although it's been at least a decade for both of us, so he knew going in that it was based on those, but people should be mindful that this is Disney - there are lots of liberties taken with the story. I saw this movie, I believe, in the theater, when I was pretty young. I may also have had a copy recorded off the Disney channel back in the day, although I honestly can't remember. Regardless, I knew what I was getting into, but my husband didn't beyond what the cover shows. He didn't hate the movie by any means, but it's quite different from the books, so that's something new viewers should keep in mind.For all that, I think it's a pretty fun tale if you can ignore the differences. It's fairly typical Disney, although the princess at least rescues the 'hero' this time around. One major thing to keep in mind though is that this movie has SKELETONS in it. Lots of them, and they are reanimated by a necromancer. If you have young children who get scared by movies, DO NOT show this to them. I can imagine a lot of nightmares coming from the experience. I'd think maybe kids over eight or nine would be fine, depending on their usual viewing fare, but use your own judgement.Again this is based on the books, so the skeletons are not really something Disney could ignore. I also noticed something during a  scene with a 'gypsy' type lady dancing on a table, in the midst of a bunch of barbarians. While it's only a split second, she flashes her panties when her skirt flies up. There's also a fair amount of sword/axe fighting and physical action.I read online that this was actually the first movie Disney put CGI effects into, which are interesting since they're mostly 'vapor', but they are green and glowing which is kind of cool. Nothing special by modern standards, but pretty neat when you think about the older movies appearance. I also read that it was basically a box office flop, which I think is kind of a shame. I remember loving this movie as a kid. As an adult I am more critical of it, but I still enjoyed watching it again. It's kind of an oddball amongst the Disney library, but worth a look in my opinion.The DVD version, by the way, is a pretty good transfer in my opinion. I'm not a technophile, but we do have a 55"" LED/LCD Samsung television with a bluray player, so bad transfers are pretty obvious. I thought this one was decent. The only thing I noticed was the bard's voice (I can't spell his name off the top of my head) - anyway his voice sounded a bit distant from the microphone. However, this may in fact be our television as it has occasionally glitched on audio channels until we've turned it off and back on again, which we didn't do. So don't let that dissuade you from checking this out if you can get a good deal.",3,Prydain adaptation is not your typical Disney movie (PG13),1350691200,"10 20, 2012",2012,3067,"['Recently', 'husband', 'were', 'discussing', 'Disney', 'movies', 'grew', 'up', 'was', 'searching', 'out', 'ones', 'did', ""n't"", 'own', 'found', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'good', 'price', '12', 'Prime', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'ordered', 'it.Both', 'have', 'read', 'Prydain', 'series', 'books', 'Lloyd', 'Alexander', 'multiple', 'times', 'been', 'least', 'decade', 'knew', 'going', 'was', 'based', 'people', 'should', 'be', 'mindful', 'Disney', 'are', 'lots', 'liberties', 'taken', 'story', 'saw', 'movie', 'believe', 'theater', 'when', 'was', 'pretty', 'young', 'may', 'also', 'have', 'had', 'copy', 'recorded', 'off', 'Disney', 'channel', 'back', 'day', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Regardless', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'husband', 'did', ""n't"", 'what', 'cover', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'movie', 'means', 'quite', 'different', 'books', 'something', 'new', 'viewers', 'should', 'keep', 'mind.For', 'think', 'pretty', 'fun', 'tale', 'can', 'ignore', 'differences', 'fairly', 'typical', 'Disney', 'princess', 'least', 'rescues', ""'hero"", 'time', 'around', 'One', 'major', 'thing', 'keep', 'mind', 'though', 'movie', 'SKELETONS', 'Lots', 'are', 'reanimated', 'necromancer', 'have', 'young', 'children', 'who', 'get', 'scared', 'movies', 'DO', 'NOT', 'show', 'can', 'imagine', 'lot', 'nightmares', 'coming', 'experience', ""'d"", 'think', 'maybe', 'kids', 'eight', 'nine', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'depending', 'usual', 'viewing', 'fare', 'use', 'own', 'judgement.Again', 'based', 'books', 'skeletons', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'something', 'Disney', 'could', 'ignore', 'also', 'noticed', 'something', 'scene', ""'gypsy"", 'type', 'lady', 'dancing', 'table', 'midst', 'bunch', 'barbarians', 'only', 'split', 'second', 'panties', 'when', 'skirt', 'up', 'also', 'fair', 'amount', 'sword/axe', 'fighting', 'physical', 'action.I', 'read', 'online', 'was', 'actually', 'first', 'movie', 'Disney', 'put', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'interesting', ""'re"", 'mostly', ""'vapor"", 'are', 'green', 'glowing', 'kind', 'cool', 'Nothing', 'special', 'modern', 'standards', 'pretty', 'neat', 'when', 'think', 'older', 'movies', 'appearance', 'also', 'read', 'was', 'basically', 'box', 'office', 'flop', 'think', 'kind', 'shame', 'remember', 'loving', 'movie', 'kid', 'adult', 'am', 'more', 'critical', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'again', 'kind', 'oddball', 'Disney', 'library', 'look', 'opinion.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'way', 'pretty', 'good', 'transfer', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'not', 'technophile', 'do', 'have', '55', 'LED/LCD', 'Samsung', 'television', 'bluray', 'player', 'so', 'bad', 'transfers', 'are', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'thought', 'one', 'was', 'decent', 'only', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'bard', 'voice', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spell', 'name', 'top', 'head', 'anyway', 'voice', 'sounded', 'bit', 'distant', 'microphone', 'However', 'may', 'fact', 'be', 'television', 'occasionally', 'glitched', 'audio', 'channels', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'off', 'back', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'dissuade', 'checking', 'out', 'can', 'get', 'good', 'deal']",The Black Cauldron Disney's Masterpiece  VHS

442227,A3EW2L59UBHQSG,6304978286,Bruce Aguilar,"[8, 10]","I love all the risks and new avenues this film took.  There is much love and thought that went into its creation.  Unfortunately most of this love and attention was focused on looks and not story.A mixture of visual styles are used in the film, hand-drawn animation, CGI (Disney's first attempt) and even live action smoke.  This mixture gives the film a very distinctive look.  One that is strikingly different from other Disney animated films.The Horned King is Disney's most terrifying looking villain ever but he's got the personality of a dead fish.  We never connect or understand him like we did say Lady Tremaine or Maleficent.  When one character sacrifices himself for the good of the others it should be an act filled with great drama and emotion but it didn't even choke me up much less bring a tear to my eye.What the film really needs is character development and a clearly thought out plot.  About a third of the way through we learn that the film is not about what we were lead to believe (the thwarting of evil) but Tarran's need to accept his position in life.  This is a drastic change and the film never really recovers it's footing afterwards.I'd like to see Disney attempt a film like this again some day because there is much they got right (the tone, character designs, general look of the film).

(The others, so far, are &quot;Lilo and Stitch&quot; and &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;.)But don't let that deter you from getting this movie and showing it to just about any age group.  Although =some= younger children might get upset about the sheer evil of the &quot;Horned King&quot; and his army, he is still one of the best Disney villains ever.The basic plot is simple.  Taran, an assistant pig keeper, finally realizes that the pig he is keeping watch over is a magical animal, capable of foretelling the future.  He, along with a few friends, must protect this pig.  The evil wizard captures the pig and finds out the location of the Black Cauldron, a very powerful magical device capable of summoning an army of undead warriors.  Taran and his friends must somehow prevent the wizard from coming to the full fruition of his plans.My favorite character was Fflewddur Fflam, the travelling minstrel that is drawn into this quest of Taran's.  Every time he tells a lie, a string breaks on his magical instrument.  This funny bit reappears several times during the movie, and it is wonderful to see him change what he is going to say in mid-sentence in order to keep his strings from breaking.Strangely, this movie is based on the =second= book in Lloyd Alexander's &quot;Chronicles of Prydain&quot;.

It was definitely one of the more ambitious animated projects undertaken by the studio.  Ten years in the making, it was also the most expensive project since 1940's ""Pinocchio"" and the first 70mm widescreen movie since ""Sleeping Beauty"" in 1959.  In THE BLACK CAULDRON, Disney attempted to cram Lloyd Alexander's densely-written ""Prydain Chronicles"" books into one movie, and the result was hardly a hit, but it's not a flop, either.Taran (voiced by Grant Bardsley) is a dreamer, looking to find his place in the adventurous world beyond the cottage of his master, Dallben (Freddie Jones).  Taran spends his days tending to a mystical clairvoyant pig called Hen Wen.  The life of Hen Wen hangs in the balance when the evil Horned King (John Hurt) decides to use her powers to find the location of the Black Cauldron, where all the evil forces of the world are kept.  Hen Wen is spirited away to the Horned King's castle with Taran in hot pursuit.  Once at the castle, Taran teams with young Princess Eilonwy (Susan Sheridan), eccentric musician Fflewddur (Nigel Hawthorne), and a cute little furry creature called Gurgi (John Byner).  Their only hope lies in finding the Black Cauldron before it's evil powers fall into the wrong hands...This is not your usual Disney fare.  It's very dark, there are no musical numbers, no real ""happily ever after"" ending, and the overall tone of the piece does not sit well with the previous Disney animated movies.  I believe the animators were trying to capture a feeling and mood that had been earlier established in other animated films of the period (Don Bluth's ""The Secret of NIMH"" and Ralph Bakshi's ""Lord of the Rings"" immediately spring to mind).  Elmer Bernstein's music perfectly underscores every mood.THE BLACK CAULDRON is a thrilling medieval adventure, and will appeal to those with a taste for that.  Disney purists are sadly always going to have a problem with it, but hopefully it will be appreciated for what it is.The DVD includes a set-top game called ""Quest for the Black Cauldron""; the vintage Donald Duck cartoon ""Trick or Treat""; still galleries, and the trailer.",4,doesn't deserve the reputation it's received...,1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,2256,"['BLACK', 'CAULDRON', 'continually', 'been', 'dismissed', 'Disney', 'enthusiasts', 'moviegoers', 'was', 'originally', 'released', '1985', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'more', 'ambitious', 'animated', 'projects', 'undertaken', 'studio', 'Ten', 'years', 'making', 'was', 'also', 'most', 'expensive', 'project', '1940', 'Pinocchio', 'first', '70mm', 'widescreen', 'movie', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', '1959', 'THE', 'BLACK', 'CAULDRON', 'Disney', 'attempted', 'cram', 'Lloyd', 'Alexander', 'densely-written', 'Prydain', 'Chronicles', 'books', 'one', 'movie', 'result', 'was', 'hardly', 'hit', 'not', 'flop', 'either.Taran', 'voiced', 'Grant', 'Bardsley', 'dreamer', 'looking', 'find', 'place', 'adventurous', 'world', 'cottage', 'master', 'Dallben', 'Freddie', 'Jones', 'Taran', 'days', 'tending', 'mystical', 'clairvoyant', 'pig', 'called', 'Hen', 'Wen', 'life', 'Hen', 'Wen', 'hangs', 'balance', 'when', 'evil', 'Horned', 'King', 'John', 'Hurt', 'use', 'powers', 'find', 'location', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'where', 'evil', 'forces', 'world', 'are', 'kept', 'Hen', 'Wen', 'spirited', 'away', 'Horned', 'King', 'castle', 'Taran', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'Once', 'castle', 'Taran', 'teams', 'young', 'Princess', 'Eilonwy', 'Susan', 'Sheridan', 'eccentric', 'musician', 'Fflewddur', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'cute', 'little', 'furry', 'creature', 'called', 'Gurgi', 'John', 'Byner', 'only', 'hope', 'finding', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'evil', 'powers', 'fall', 'wrong', 'hands', 'not', 'usual', 'Disney', 'fare', 'very', 'dark', 'are', 'musical', 'numbers', 'real', 'happily', 'ever', 'ending', 'overall', 'tone', 'piece', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'previous', 'Disney', 'animated', 'movies', 'believe', 'animators', 'were', 'trying', 'capture', 'feeling', 'mood', 'had', 'been', 'earlier', 'established', 'other', 'animated', 'films', 'period', 'Don', 'Bluth', 'Secret', 'NIMH', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'immediately', 'spring', 'mind', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'music', 'perfectly', 'mood.THE', 'BLACK', 'CAULDRON', 'thrilling', 'medieval', 'adventure', 'will', 'appeal', 'taste', 'Disney', 'purists', 'are', 'sadly', 'always', 'going', 'have', 'problem', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'appreciated', 'what', 'DVD', 'set-top', 'game', 'called', 'Quest', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'vintage', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'cartoon', 'Trick', 'Treat', 'still', 'galleries', 'trailer']",The Black Cauldron Disney's Masterpiece  VHS

The picture and especially colors on this transfer to DVD are top notch. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because (if your very picky about your total picture quality) you can BARLEY notice (only if you look very close) the film element transfer with a very slight grain flicker. I am very picky about my DVD quality and I would suggest anybody that is a fan of the film to go ahead and buy it and overlook this very slight problem because you have to look very close to notice it. Otherwise I will say this is the best yet transfer to DVD that Disney has done. The colors are brillant and picture perfect in every way.SOUND QUALITY - TOP NOTCH! This is absolutly the best surround sound transfer I have heard yet from any Disney DVD. The surround sound is in Doldby Digital 5.1 Surround EX which is not stated on the box cover. The surround effects with the EX is one of my favorite dvds. All surround sounds are placed correctly and put you in the movie. I highly suggest this DVD for sound enthusiists who are into the home theatre surround effects.

Mom""","[5, 9]","This particular Disney animated feature is from that period of slump between golden ages: after those classic features supervised by Walt himself, and before the present golden age, of which Beauty and the Beast was the first flower. Although a relatively pleasant and undemanding viewing experience, it is, to my way of thinking, a strong contender with The Jungle Book for  a Disney animated movie feature which bears only the barest and most coincidental resemblance to the source material it was based on - in this case, Lloyd Alexander's Prydain cycle. In this instance, names and characters are retained, and a few plot elements and situations from a cycle of five books are wrenched from their original settings and bolted hastily together in service to a standard-issue quest and finding yourself plot. The animation is pleasing in it's workmanship, there is a certain amount of mild humor, some rather scary bits involving the Horned King and his minions, and you certainly can't go wrong with an oracular pig. At the age of eight or so, my daughter loved it. However, this production has kind of going-through-the-motions-by-rote air about it; as if the producers at Disney realized that here was this wonderful best-selling bit of kid-lit out there, and they were in the business of doing animated movies based on popular kid-lit, so better get busy and crank it out because that was what everyone was expecting. There is pretty much the same perfunctory feeling about this release; a 25th Anniversary Logo on the cover, inclusion of the original theatrical trailer, a single deleted scene, a game, and a still-frame gallery.Seriously, I wonder what Peter Jackson would have made from the Prydain books - at least three live-action movies with killer CGI effects and been packing them in by the million, I'm sure.",2,"A winner in my own contest for ""coincidental resemblance to the book it was based on""",1289865600,"11 16, 2010",2010,1824,"['particular', 'Disney', 'animated', 'feature', 'period', 'slump', 'golden', 'ages', 'classic', 'features', 'supervised', 'Walt', 'present', 'golden', 'age', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'was', 'first', 'flower', 'relatively', 'pleasant', 'undemanding', 'viewing', 'experience', 'way', 'thinking', 'strong', 'contender', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'Disney', 'animated', 'movie', 'feature', 'only', 'barest', 'most', 'coincidental', 'resemblance', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'based', 'case', 'Lloyd', 'Alexander', 'Prydain', 'cycle', 'instance', 'names', 'characters', 'are', 'retained', 'few', 'plot', 'elements', 'situations', 'cycle', 'five', 'books', 'are', 'wrenched', 'original', 'settings', 'bolted', 'hastily', 'together', 'service', 'standard-issue', 'quest', 'finding', 'plot', 'animation', 'pleasing', 'workmanship', 'certain', 'amount', 'mild', 'humor', 'rather', 'scary', 'bits', 'involving', 'Horned', 'King', 'minions', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'oracular', 'pig', 'age', 'eight', 'so', 'daughter', 'loved', 'However', 'production', 'kind', 'going-through-the-motions-by-rote', 'air', 'producers', 'Disney', 'realized', 'here', 'was', 'wonderful', 'best-selling', 'bit', 'kid-lit', 'there', 'were', 'business', 'doing', 'animated', 'movies', 'based', 'popular', 'kid-lit', 'so', 'better', 'get', 'busy', 'crank', 'out', 'was', 'what', 'everyone', 'was', 'expecting', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'perfunctory', 'feeling', 'release', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Logo', 'cover', 'inclusion', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'single', 'deleted', 'scene', 'game', 'still-frame', 'gallery.Seriously', 'wonder', 'what', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Prydain', 'books', 'least', 'three', 'live-action', 'movies', 'killer', 'CGI', 'effects', 'been', 'packing', 'million', ""'m"", 'sure']",The Black Cauldron Disney's Masterpiece  VHS
442234,A2O39VY1UEDCKH,6304978286,Charles Jannuzi,"[2, 3]","At the time this film was released, Disney was getting competition from other animators--remember the animated versions of 'Watership Down' and Bakshi's 'Lord of the Rings'. However, none of these were very successful at the box office. The real competition was from live action features using loads of what was then state-of-the-art special effects. Namely 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek' films and their imitators.This film is a lushly animated masterpiece that is interesting to compare with 'Watership Down' and 'Lord of the Rings' (Bakshi's film that is). It also, along with these other two films, helps set the precedent for making animated features that might appeal to boys and to older children more. These are all films many adults could watch and enjoy as well. So much later we see the results: films like 'Titan A.E.' and 'Atlantis'.Still the Disney animators at the time tried to push too much storyline into too little animation--80 minutes just isn't enough to tell a story that could have been a very Lord-of-the-Rings-or-Star-Wars-like cycle about good ultimately overcoming all-powerful evil. The other compromise they make is trying to offset the darkness of the film with comic relief and cute characters that you would find in Disney's numerous G-rated efforts.To conclude, this is a classic that should appeal to kids who enjoy films like 'Titan A.E.', 'Atlantis', and 'Treasure Planet' (although BC was done in the era before CGI).

442240,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6304978286,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[44, 47]","In 1985, Walt Disney Pictures released their 25th animated feature in July 1985.  The animated film ""The Black Cauldron"" is based on the first two novels of Lloyd Alexander's ""Chronicles of Prydain"" books (a total of five novels were created from 1964-1968) and is based on Welsh mythology.""The Black Cauldron"" is the first Disney film to utilize the APT process (a photographic transfer system that can transfer lines or solid blocks of colors onto cels) and as most new animated technology, the film was quite expensive to make.It was also a Disney film in which it was an interesting risk for the company as the studio wanted to created a PG-rated animated film, especially since the original books that the animated film was adapted from, was quite dark.  Because the animated film was not a musical nor was it a happy, uplifting film that many young children would want to see, the film didn't perform quite well in the box office (the film was budgeted at $25 million and made $21 million).But times have changed since the ""The Black Cauldron"" was shown in the theater and with films such as ""The Lord of the Rings"" and television shows such as ""The Legend of the Seeker"" are more common place for today, there is no doubt that the storyline of ""The Black Cauldron"" will attract viewers and now ""The Black Cauldron"" will receive its DVD re-release in Sept. 2010 (the original ""The Black Cauldron - Gold Collection"" DVD was released in 2000) to celebrate the film's 25th anniversary.VIDEO:""The Black Cauldron"" is presented in widescreen 2:35:1 (enhanced for 169 televisions).  The first thing that came to my mind while watching this film is how beautiful the artistic backgrounds were.  There is a lot of painted with a lot of detail in the background.  From the look of the wood homes or buckets, to the lush scenery of grass and water or even the detail of the dark forest,  ""The Black Cauldron"" looks fantastic.  Walt Disney had done a fantastic job with the hand-drawn animation and overall look of the film. The last film before ""The Black Cauldron"" was the 1981 film ""The Fox and the Hound"", so it is no surprise to me that because the amount of detail we see in this film, this film took years to make.The film looks great!  But because of the film's dark subject matter, it's unfortunate that the film was not appreciated when it was released in 1985 and it makes me wonder, because the film is not a box office earning classic, if it will ever receive Disney's wonderful HD restoration and remastering treatment in the future?AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Black Cauldron"" is presented in Dolby Digital (English, French and Spanish 5.1 surround).  The dialogue is clear and understandable and if anything, I found myself just laughing at the parts that featured Gurgi talking.  Love the sound effects that went into creating his voice.  I will say that Elmer Bernstein's music (""Twilight"", ""Cape Fear"", ""Bulletproof"") in the film is fantastic!Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Black Cauldron - 25th Anniversary"" comes with the following special features:* Deleted Scene--(9:50) The Fairfolk: Viewers join Taran, Fflewddur Fflam, Gurgi and Princess Eilonwy as they travel into the depths of the earth and meet the Fairfolk.  A combination of animation and the deleted animated and non-animated sketch of the various scenes.* Still Frame Gallery--A compilation of behind-the-scenes artwork and photos that you can view via using your remote control (or keyboard).* The Witches' Challenge Game--In order to defeat the dark powers of the Horned King, players must gain possession the magical sword from the Witches of Morva by solving their riddles.* Quest For the Black Cauldron--A trivia game in which players compete against the evil Horned King in a race to reach the Black Cauldron first.* Trick Or Treat-- (8:15) A classic Donald Duck Jack Hannah Halloween cartoon from 1952.JUDGMENT CALL:""The Black Cauldron"" probably didn't make sense to viewers in 1985 but 25-years-later, the story is quite tame and I personally didn't find the overall film to be too dark.  In fact, I watched it along with my seven-year-old and he just enjoyed the film and was quite engrossed while watching it.I found the film to be quite entertaining but by saying this, I know that the film is based on Lloyd Alexander's ""The Prydain Chronicles"" and the fact there are five-volumes created, If the first two volumes were condensed to an 80-minute film, you can imagine a lot of story being lost, especially storylines that were meant to focus on character development.So, having not read the original novels, I can imagine those who did enjoy them, may feel a bit disenchanted with the film and with Disney trying to fit everything into one film and also the film missing a lot of characters from the book and I've also read that Disney did change a few things to make it more Disney friendly.  But again, this was released in 1985 and that was how things were back then with Disney.""The Black Cauldron - 25th Anniversary"" does add a little more content from its original 2000 ""Gold Collection"" DVD release.  You do get the new ""The Witches"" challenge game and you do get a full nine minute deleted scene as well.  And for those who are wondering, the animated short ""Trick or Treat"" starring Donald Duck and his 3 nephews is still included as well as the previous other special features as well.  It's also important to note that Disney did improve it's DVD authoring after 2003, so since the film was released originally on DVD in 2000, there is an improvement in picture quality on this 2010 DVD release.As for parents, this is a PG film and I would not recommend this film to very young children. The Horned King is an evil nemesis and a villain that can be too frightening for children and although there are no sexual themes in the film, there are parts where you see a buxom witch and seeing the character Fflewddur Fflam getting his head stuck between them.  A scene which my wife did comment and was surprised to see (especially since we had our child watching along with us).Overall, ""The Black Cauldron"" is a good film but I say this, having not read the original novels (so I don't share the same disappointment as those who have).  I do feel that the writers really did have a major challenge of trying to incorporate so much into an 80-minute film and the fact that the film only covers the first two novels, it's a shame that the other three novels will not be made into an animated format.  But I suppose if you go with this film's storyline on its own, despite having a dark storyline, in Disney fashion, you do have the happy ending.I was very impressed by the artistic painted backgrounds and the animation was well-done.  But compared to other Disney animated classics, the storyline was good but not great and I refuse to call it an inferior film because it's not inferior at all. It's just that Disney has so many great films and ""The Black Cauldron"" is not one of them.  But I found the film to feature a good amount of fantasy and action and it looks fantastic.  It's definitely a Disney animated film worth watching.If you have not watched this Disney animated film, definitely give ""The Black Cauldron - 25th Anniversary"" a try!",4,"f you haven't watched ""The Black Cauldron"" definitely give this 25th Anniversary edition on DVD a chance!",1285286400,"09 24, 2010",2010,7273,"['1985', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Pictures', 'released', '25th', 'animated',

It's not the worst film Disney has ever made,  but it just doesn't rank up with the &quot;classic&quot; characters and  stories it is famous for.  The only truly memorable character in THE BLACK  CAULDRON is the comical little Gurgi, who ironically is nowhere to be found  in Lloyd Alexander's series.  The producers of the film wisely had most of  the characters speak in Welsh accents to ensure authenticity, and not in  Californian or Southern accents.  The most spectacular moments are when  Taran and his friends are confronted by the Emperor King in his dark,  creepy castle.  But most of the scenes in THE BLACK CAULDRON could have  easily been made as a live-action feature, making this animated feature  appear a little pretentious at times.I've read that loyal fans of Lloyd  Alexander's work and THE BLACK CAULDRON consider this film a cult classic.

The Black Caldron is one of Disney's different efforts, for one it is not a musical. This is another decent entry in the Disney animated film cannon with great animation and dramtic use of color and wonderful backgrounds, but the films after Sleeping Beauty just don't have the Disney luster we've all become accustomed to in the early days.While this isn't Disney's best, it is an enjoyable and pretty solid film. The animation process has been fleshed out more and the new animation process isn't as jarring as it seemed in Sword and the Stone.  The artwork is beautiful in the film, but it is a totally different style.OK, now about the film and video releases. I have owned both DVD releases and the 25th anniversary DVD is far and away the best choice. The first release was released in full screen and fortunately the 25th anniversary edition is presented in 2:35:1 the correct aspect ratio. It would be nice to see this film on Blu Ray as the 25th DVD looks and sounds great. The extras are very thin with a stills gallery, lost scene and nothing more really worth mentioning.

Not one song is in this film, and that gives it a major benifit becuase it kept the film very serious and dark. A lot of the past reviewers have said that the animation is not very good. Aside from one scene, I strongly disagree with this. The animation is not extraordinary, but it does succeed in making the atmospheric mood a very dark one.Besides, animation is not what carries this film, it's it's characters. Starting foremost, with the Horned King, a villian that goes beyond any bad guy before him using the Cauldron's magic to resurrect his army of skeletons. This provides one of the movie's most intense and dramatic sequences. The comedic relief in this film belong to Creeper, the king's goblin creature and Gurgi, a cowardly creature who redeems himself later in the film. Both do well in making us laugh, but not going too far to avoid taking the film's dark feel. Taran is the main character, but aside from knowing that he wants to be a hero, not much is known of him.This film is greatly underappreciated, mostly becuase it was a severe economical failure.

I think it lasted about two weeks in the theaters, then Disney pulled it.(Something else people might not realize is that, while a failure in theaters, The Black Cauldron was modified and ported over into TV. It became one of Disney's most successful animated  TV series: The Gummy Bears.  While Taran, Eilonwy, and Creeper are renamed and not the main characters, they are in there!)Left in the Disney vaults until 1998, this now restored full-length animated feature is a gem, if not a bit rough around the edges.  Without your standard ""filler"" material of songs and silly dancing, The Black Cauldron uses dialog, stunning animation, and action to keep it moving.The movie is dark, foreboding, and just plain creepy. It is rated PG, and I DO NOT recommend letting your kids sit in front of this  one alone!But for all its good points, The Black Cauldron strays far from Lloyd Alexander's books, too much is left unexplained, and you never get the chance to really care for any of the characters.  Compared to other Disney movies, this is a major change as we're always drawn in and quickly bond with the lead characters.Oh, and contrary to what other reviewers have said, this was NOT Disney's first PG rated movie.

Boy, do I miss the good old days with just 2-D animation, and no computer enhancement to be seen.  I'm only thirteen, so I don't want to act like I know and have seen it all.  But because of my age I feel privilaged to really know how *GOOD* these older movies are (most kids I know don't).  Anyway, on with THE BLACK CAULDRON.This is a very strange film for me; when I was little, I didn't like the movie at all.  It didn't necessarily scare me (though I definitely found the movie creepy), I just didn't like it.  Then just yesterday I saw it on TV in the morning, so I figured ""What the heck?"" and watched.  And for some reason, I really liked it!  I just loved the old-fashioned fairy tale plot and characters.  Sure, Taran and the Princess don't break any new ground, but they don't try to, and that's some of the charm to the story.  And I can't write a review for this movie without mentioning The Horned King. . . . . . aaaahhhhh, what a grand villain!  His prescence reminds one of the villains of old, like Malefecent from SLEEPING BEAUTY.  And don't forget the classic score by Elmer Bernstein.At the time, this was the most expensive animated movie ever made (at $25 million . . . . . that's $15 million more than the original STAR WARS cost, people!), and it shows.  THE BLACK CAULDRON mixes all kinds of animation, from traditional Disney-style to new-age techniques.  But none of the new stuff do any more than enhance the story.  If this movie was made nowadays, it would be chalk-full of pointless show-stoppers.  It's a beautiful looking film, pure and simple.Oh, and I forgot to mention the spectacular voice cast: Freddie Jones, John Hurt, John Huston, Susan Sheridan, Grant Bardsley, and more inhabit the movie throughout.  Their prescence further enhances the classic traditional feel of the story.For all those who enjoyed so much SLEEPING BEAUTY, or for all those of this generation who are wondering why all the grown-ups keep praising Disney, see this film.  Though it is far from Disney's best, you'll undoubtedly see what they are talking about.(P.S.

Yes, I love Disney. But the two just didn't mix in this animated feature. I am aware that Disney always changes classic stories (and sometimes history) to make their movies, and I'm usually quite willing to forgive them for it. After all, fairy tales and folk stories are passed on through word of mouth and change a little everytime someone new tells the story. Disney is just one of those voices. But when you take a relatively new work whose author is still alive and claim to be retelling the story, it needs to be somewhat similar. Honestly, the only thing accurate in the whole movie are the names of the main characters. They even got the color of Hen Wen's eyes wrong after such a big deal is made out of that point in the books. You'd think that would be a simple thing! But even this would be forgivable if Disney had produced a decent movie. But, in my opinion, this was not good at all. The plot was rushed and the characters shallow (except maybe Taran). I had seen this movie before I read the books and didn't like it at all. I watched it again after I read the books thinking that I would appreciate it more after knowing some background information, but it was even worse! Disney could have made a really good fantasy film if they had had the confidence to write their own story. Instead they were constrained by their ties to a highly regarded series of books that couldn't possibly be boiled down into an 80 minute movie with any success. I think they learned their lesson, though, since in recent years we've seen several top-notch original stories from Disney that didn't have any of the short-comings of  &quot;The Black Cauldron.&quot; Thank you, Disney, for learning from your mistake!",1,Disney's mistake,1029542400,"08 17, 2002",2002,1850,"['What', 'were', 'thinking', 'Why', 'earth', 'tried', 'make', 'cartoon', 'based', 'Prydain', 'Chronicles', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'Yes', 'love', 'books', 'Yes', 'love', 'Disney', 'two', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'mix', 'animated', 'feature', 'am', 'aware', 'Disney', 'always', 'classic', 'stories', 'sometimes', 'history', 'make', 'movies', ""'m"", 'usually', 'quite', 'willing', 'forgive', 'fairy', 'tales', 'folk', 'stories', 'are', 'passed', 'word', 'mouth', 'change', 'little', 'everytime', 'someone', 'new', 'tells', 'story', 'Disney', 'just', 'one', 'voices', 'when', 'take', 'relatively', 'new', 'work', 'author', 'still', 'alive', 'claim', 'be', 'retelling', 'story', 'be', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'Honestly', 'only', 'thing', 'accurate', 'whole', 'movie', 'are', 'names', 'main', 'characters', 'even', 'got', 'color', 'Hen', 'Wen', 'eyes', 'wrong', 'big', 'deal', 'made', 'point', 'books', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'simple', 'thing', 'even', 'would', 'be', 'forgivable', 'Disney', 'had', 'produced', 'decent', 'movie', 'opinion', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'plot', 'was', 'rushed', 'characters', 'shallow', 'maybe', 'Taran', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', 'read', 'books', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'watched', 'again', 'read', 'books', 'thinking', 'would', 'appreciate', 'more', 'knowing', 'background', 'information', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'Disney', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'really', 'good', 'fantasy', 'film', 'had', 'had', 'confidence', 'write', 'own', 'story', 'Instead', 'were', 'constrained', 'ties', 'highly', 'regarded', 'series', 'books', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'boiled', 'down', '80', 'minute', 'movie', 'success', 'think', 'learned', 'lesson', 'though', 'recent', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'top-notch', 'original', 'stories', 'Disney', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'short-comings', 'quot', 'Black', 'Cauldron.', 'quot', 'Thank', 'Disney', 'learning', 'mistake']",The Black Cauldron Disney's Masterpiece  VHS

This is a tale of swords and sorcery, evil, revenge and magic. It is the story of a search for a magic cauldron that if it falls into the hands of the evil Horned King, will be used as an abyss of endless evil. This Disney animated film is in the old tradition of SNOW WHITE, PINOCCHIO and BAMBI where some frightening moments and moments of real loss bring reality to the tale. THE BLACK CAULDRON had to follow this same mold to bring it credibility. If it looked too cute it would not work. You can see this same balance in SLEEPING BEAUTY. Good characterizations are the backbone of this film. The Horned King (coldly voiced by John Hurt), and a wooly little creature named Gurgi (voiced by John Byner) are the best. Gurgi is a great character who slurps and gurgles his way through this tale giving it that little bit of required levity. In fact the cauldron-born scenes were toned down before the release of this film. Taran the main character keeps the tale moving in a prerequisite and obligatory role. Creeper is one of the more memorable and noteworthy henchmen. ALL in all I think this is one of Disney's better films of the last two decades. I love the score by Elmer Bernstein that is lush yet whimsical.

442254,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,6304978286,Graves,"[3, 8]","The Black Cauldron is based, very, very loosely on the first book of a 5 book series about Taran, an assistant pig keeper in the land of Prydain. It was Disney's first PG rated cartoon and it is a prime example of the sort of animated films that nearly destroyed the Disney studios in the dark time between Walt's death and when they made ""The Little Mermaid."" I loved the books when I was a kid and finally got around to viewing the movie. I'd heard all the rumors but thought `they just didn't get it, I understand the books."" Wow was I wrong.Lloyd Alexander's series is great childrens' adventures and good reading for someone in that age group. In the book Taran is the assistant pig keeper to a wizardly type who is the keeper of a magical oraclular pig. As the land is threatened by an evil 'horned lord'  Taran stumlbes into an adventure where he find personal growth and makes new friends all of whom help each other to become better people.In theory it should have been a wonderful transition to a Disney film. however they badly bobbled it. The head pig keeper in the books comes across as more of a wizardly type while the cartoon makes him into an almost clueless tavern keeper type who somehow thinks sending the oracular pig Hen-wen into the woods will keep her safe from the evil Horned Lord. It doesn't work and the assistant pig keeper goes on a series of adventures with friends he picked up along the way.The problem is here the film dropped characters, changed some things around from later in the series, added characters, and completely denuded the magic pig and the chief pig keeper of all their significance from early on.Add to this the animation is not up to the standard one expects of a Disney film. The style looks more like Bakski's rotoscoped films and has none of the whimsy of either Walt's style of animation or what we would later enjoy in films like the Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast or the Lion King.

A dark fantasy adapted from Lloyd Alexander's ""The Chronicles of Prydain"" book series, it features deep spiritual storylines and was given a PG rating for several very good reasons.With the voice talents of Freddie Jones, Grant Bardsley and John Hurt(""The Elephant Man,"" ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone,"") it tells the story of Taran, an assistant pig attendant charged with keeping his clairvoyant pig out of the grasp of the demonic Horned King.  The Horned King is voiced with palpable malice by John Hurt in a genuinely edgy vocal performance that makes one wonder what Mr. Hurt would do in a live-action rendering of the same role.  The very name ""The Horned King"" can be seen as a satanic euphemism in an uncommonly direct association with evil for a Disney villain.This movie is very certainly not for everyone, as its prevailing tone is of a downbeat nature.

After all, I saw this movie when I was a child and have fond memories of it - and that came BEFORE I took it upon myself to read the novels. Needless to say, my opinion was altered, for ""The Black Cauldron"" is not at all like the book from which it draws its name. Instead, it's kind of a combination of ""The Book of Three,"" ""The Black Cauldron,"" and, to a lesser extent, ""The High King"" (which translates into Prydain books 1, 2, and 5). Most of Alexander's best stuff has been removed, and Disney has inserted some pretty bad fluff in its place. The books are so wonderful that it's hard to believe anyone would want to butcher them so, but here it is nonetheless - and were it not for the fantastic animation, the good voice-acting, and the dark atmosphere (for a PG-rated Disney movie, anyway), it would be hard to recommend to anyone over the age of 10. At the same time, it's the only visual adaptation of the series you're likely to get, so that's saying something... perhaps. I just wish somebody would buy the rights and do something better with them - a couple of films or a miniseries, maybe.

When the film first came out in the mid '80s, it devastated Disney financially due to its very poor box office performance and very high cost. Pity, I really liked this film. It was one of the few Disney cartoons not based on any classic fairy tail. It was original. It was not formulaic like just about everything else produced by Disney before and since. Dark, dingy, and scary - oh yeah! Fearsome creatures, villain, and ghouls, oh my! Finally Disney began showing some guts, to go beyond the usual sugar coated fluff, kind of like Disney meets Dungeons and Dragons. The cutesy kid stuff was kept at a minimum (though not eliminated completely) and there was none of the usual song and dance numbers. Unfortunately it didn't pay off, and Disney went back to doing what it always had been doing. Sigh...The animation was fairly good.

First, the synopsis tells you the moral of the story and takes away the reason to watch it.  Second, it mentions the Black Cauldron is Disney's 25th animated classic.  This means that if it is a Disney animated film it is automatically a classic.  I find that thought an insult to my intelligence.This departs from the previous films.  I don't mind the lack of music, but it is both creepier and darker than the other classics, and it has other scenes that I question its appropriateness (e.g. a voluptuous witch with a low cut outfit with a scene emphasizing that part of her anataomy).  I also found that the horned king, while evil, lacks the charm and personality of other Disney villains (e.g. Malificent of Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians' Cruella DeVille).As art, it is visually stunning.

Needless to say I ran out to the store August 4 of that year to buy my copy of this never-before-released-on-video animated Disney flick and popped it into the VCR as soon as I got home.  I honestly do not understand why so many people who have reviewed this movie have called it bad.  Sure, it's different, and yes, it did recieve a PG rating, but those are not nessesarily bad things.  And, yes, appearently it IS different from the book, but, putting all of that aside, it is a WONDERFUL movie, and, unlike some reviewers, I'm very glad that they let it out of the vaults.Taran, dreams of being an incridible warrior, but soon finds himself reduced to searching for Hen Wen, a young pig he tends to that has run away.  This eventually leads to his embarking on a quest to find the mythical Black Cauldron, which gives the one who bears it ultumate power, before the evil Horned King.  Aside from the adventurous, dark mood, the movie carries other strengths, too.  First off, the characters are amazing and can be related to.  I too have dreams and fears just like Taran (in fact quite simmilar in one perspective), and he is like a welcome friend to me.  Gurgi is cute and funny and is this movie's classic Disney sidekick; there's one in every classic, you know.  Second, there's the annimation - it's amazingly mood-setting and obviously helped the animators learn a great viriaty of skills they would use in later films. Finally, there's the film's tear-jerking (yes, I did say ""tear-jerking"" in regard to Disney's ""The Black Cauldron,"" folks) ending and the timeless moral that is illustrated within it -- I won't say what it is; you have to go rent (or better yet buy) this too-often-ignored Disney gem to find that part out.  To top it all off, the original 1998 release has a very cool-looking cover, supposedly ""FX packaging"" according to some old TV spots; the Gold reissue has a wonderful (different) logo and cover image too.All in all, I can't find a negative thing to say about it.  The DVD supposedly has it in widescreen, which I'd love to see - and the Gold Collection issue (in both VHS and DVD formats) has ""Trick or Treat,"" a classic Donald Duck short.  I don't know why I don't have this on DVD yet!  It's something you and I should both make a point to get.  Amazing!

We will say this movie is much darker in content than most Disney films.  It has skeleton soldiers, witches, and often visits the concept of death in skeletal remain fill dungeons.  That being said, it also has fairies, a cute magical pig, and a happy ending the whole family can enjoy.  It was also fun to discover that John Hurt played the voice of the main villain?  The same man that was Mr. Ollivander in Harry Potter and the lovable Narrator in the original Storyteller (another classic).  The film did have a few questionable aspects, slow points, and oddities; and we could not help but compare the character Gurgi to the Lord of the Rings Gollum in every way (voice, movement/mannerisms, and the final fall).  Having never read the Hobbit or Lord of the Rings books, I wonder if this character's mannerisms, plot, and voice might have been ""borrowed"" for either film.

442266,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,6304978286,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[15, 16]","In 1985, Disney attempted to do a PG-rated swords-and-sorcery animated tale based on a good source material--Lloyd Alexander's CHRONICLES OF PRYDAIN.  The resulting movie had a lot of winning things going for it--for one, the animation was impressive for its time, showcasing an early mixture of CG effects.  A massive underscore by Elmer Bernstein (which remains one of the best for a Disney movie) substitutes singing characters here.  In addtion, there are at least some well-defined (and created) characters, notably the young, inexperienced ""pig-boy"" Taran, the terrifying Horned King (voiced superbly by John Hurt) and of course the two ""comic"" characters, Gurgi (a Gollum-like character with a childlike innocence and more loyalty--and an equally cuddly voice) and Creeper (a great baddie sidekick for a villain).And yet the movie is considered Disney's greatest failure. It is understandable to see why: for one, the movie flopped at the box office (in fact, it took more than 10 years after its theatrical debut to finally arrive on home video). Second, in trying to compress the five-volume ""Chronicles of Prydain"" into one movie, the story comes across as a little too overplotted and frustratingly leaves questions one is likely to have about its characters (and magic rules) unanswered. The third reason is that aside from the aforementioned quartet of Taran, the Horned King, Gurgi, and Creeper, the characters aren't as well defined or memorable as they could be. In particular, Princess Eilonwy (whose bitchiness from the novels has been noticeably toned down for the film) comes across as an underdeveloped heroine--her abrupt shift from berating Taran's boasting about who got them out of trouble to a quasi-romantic love interest felt jarring to me. The same, frustratingly, feels true for many of the other characters, even if some of them (Fflewdurr Flamm, an elderly minstrel whose harpstrings happen to snap every time he lies) are actually quite likeable and/or interesting (a trio of batty witches who hold the titular object).But even with its flaws, THE BLACK CAULDRON is by no means Disney's worst animated feature (that prestigious title belongs to HERCULES and probably HOME ON THE RANGE). True, it is problematic, but I nonetheless enjoyed the movie and applaud the animators for painting a grim, gothic fantasy setting through art. If only the plotting and characters were better developed, it would've been a classic. I would definitely recommend reading the books to get a full experience on the universe Disney was struggling to portray but by all means try out the movie as well. It has a lot of high points and there are some great animation effects (notably when an army of skeleton warriors comes alive), even though it probably isn't one of Disney's best.A word of caution to parents: this is probably not a good film for children to watch. THE BLACK CAULDRON was clearly rated PG for a reason--not anything in the way of graphic violence or profanity, but there are lots of scenes which do come across as nightmarish, especially those involving the Horned King.As far as the DVD release goes, it's a bit sparse on the extras, but the slide-show feature on its production origins and spin-offs warrants the purchase alone. The visual transfer is well done (aside from a few film scratches and one period of dirt filter) and it sure beats watching a pan-and-scan version. The real star of the DVD, though is the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound mix. THE BLACK CAULDRON was originally mixed for six-track Dolby Surround, and the music by Elmer Bernstein comes across as brilliant and the dialogue separation is impeccable.So there you have it, my impressions of this flawed yet grossly undervalued entry to the Disney animation cannon. True, it's far from perfect, but as long as you don't compare it to the books (and acknowledge that it was created at a time when the studio was in something of a slump), THE BLACK CAULDRON is enjoyable and leaps and bounds above the weakest animated films ever made.",4,"Not a Disney ""classic"", but an interesting experience.",1113523200,"04 15, 2005",2005,4032,"['1985', 'Disney', 'attempted', 'do', 'PG-rated', 'swords-and-sorcery', 'animated', 'tale', 'based', 'good', 'source', 'material', 'Lloyd', 'Alexander', 'CHRONICLES', 'OF', 'PRYDAIN', 'resulting', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'winning', 'things', 'going', 'one', 'animation', 'was', 'impressive', 'time', 'showcasing', 'early', 'mixture', 'CG', 'effects', 'massive', 'underscore', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'one', 'best', 'Disney', 'movie', 'singing', 'characters', 'here', 'addtion', 'are', 'least', 'well-defined', 'created', 'characters', 'notably', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'pig-boy', 'Taran', 'terrifying', 'Horned', 'King', 'voiced', 'superbly', 'John', 'Hurt', 'course', 'two', 'comic', 'characters', 'Gurgi', 'Gollum-like', 'character', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'more', 'loyalty', 'equally', 'cuddly', 'voice', 'Creeper', 'great', 'baddie', 'sidekick', 'villain', '.And', 'yet', 'movie', 'considered', 'Disney', 'greatest', 'failure', 'understandable', 'see', 'why', 'one', 'movie', 'flopped', 'box', 'office', 'fact', 'took', 'more', '10', 'years', 'theatrical', 'debut', 'finally', 'arrive', 'home', 'video', 'Second', 'trying', 'compress', 'five-volume', 'Chronicles', 'Prydain', 'one', 'movie', 'story', 'across', 'little', 'too', 'overplotted', 'frustratingly', 'questions', 'one', 'likely', 'have', 'characters', 'magic', 'rules', 'unanswered', 'third', 'reason', 'aside', 'aforementioned', 'quartet', 'Taran', 'Horned', 'King', 'Gurgi', 'Creeper', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'defined', 'memorable', 'could', 'be', 'particular', 'Princess', 'Eilonwy', 'bitchiness', 'novels', 'been', 'noticeably', 'toned', 'down', 'film', 'across', 'underdeveloped', 'heroine', 'abrupt', 'shift', 'berating', 'Taran', 'boasting', 'who', 'got', 'trouble', 'quasi-romantic', 'love', 'interest', 'felt', 'jarring', 'same', 'frustratingly', 'feels', 'true', 'many', 'other', 'characters', 'even', 'Fflewdurr', 'Flamm', 'elderly', 'minstrel', 'harpstrings', 'happen', 'snap', 'time', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'likeable', 'and/or', 'interesting', 'trio', 'batty', 'witches', 'who', 'hold', 'titular', 'object', '.But', 'even', 'flaws', 'THE', 'BLACK', 'CAULDRON', 'means', 'Disney', 'worst', 'animated', 'feature', 'prestigious', 'title', 'belongs', 'HERCULES', 'probably', 'HOME', 'ON', 'THE', 'RANGE', 'True', 'problematic', 'nonetheless', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'applaud', 'animators', 'painting', 'grim', 'gothic', 'fantasy', 'setting', 'art', 'only', 'plotting', 'characters', 'were', 'better', 'developed', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'classic', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'reading', 'books', 'get', 'full', 'experience', 'universe', 'Disney', 'was', 'struggling', 'portray', 'means', 'try', 'out', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'high', 'points', 'are', 'great', 'animation', 'effects', 'notably', 'when', 'army', 'skeleton', 'warriors', 'alive', 'even', 'probably', ""n't"", 'one', 'Disney', 'best.A', 'word', 'caution', 'parents', 'probably', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'children', 'watch', 'BLACK', 'CAULDRON', 'was', 'clearly', 'rated', 'PG', 'reason', 'not', 'anything', 'way', 'graphic', 'violence', 'profanity', 'are', 'lots', 'scenes', 'do', 'come', 'nightmarish', 'especially', 'involving', 'Horned', 'King.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'release', 'bit', 'sparse', 'extras', 'slide-show', 'feature', 'production', 'origins', 'spin-offs', 'warrants', 'purchase', 'alone', 'visual', 'transfer', 'well', 'done', 'aside', 'few', 'film', 'scratches', 'one', 'period', 'dirt', 'filter', 'sure', 'watching', 'pan-and-scan', 'version', 'real', 'star', 'DVD', 'though', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'sound', 'mix', 'BLACK', 'CAULDRON', 'was', 'originally', 'mixed', 'six-track', 'Dolby', 'Surround', 'music', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'brilliant', 'dialogue', 'separation', 'impeccable.So', 'have', 'impressions', 'flawed', 'yet', 'grossly', 'undervalued', 'entry', 'Disney', 'animation', 'cannon', 'True', 'far', 'perfect', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'compare', 'books', 'acknowledge', 'was', 'created', 'time', 'when', 'studio', 'was', 'something', 'slump', 'THE', 'BLACK', 'CAULDRON', 'enjoyable', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'weakest', 'animated', 'films', 'ever', 'made']",The Black Cauldron Disney's Masterpiece  VHS

Thomason ""Movie Family""","[1, 1]","The Black Cauldron Bowling for Movies Score: 219.375 of 300 - an overlooked and under-appreciated gem!What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]The Black Cauldron - we own the original DVD release from 2000... why they released on DVD and not Blu Ray in 2012, I'll never know - we would have upgraded in a hot second!Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):A young assistant pig-keeper, Taran, is charged with protecting a fantastically magical porker Hen Wen (and she's SOOOME PIG) by pig owner and local enchanter Dallben.  It seems the war lord known simply as the Horned King - a super spooky skeleton with a bad temper - is on the hunt for the mystical Black Cauldron, a magical pot which can return the dead to gainful employment in his evil army.  Dallben orders Taran to keep Hen Wen safe so naturally Taran loses sight of her in the first few minutes to the Horn King's minions.  Taran risks life and limb to rescue his pig meeting several new friends along the way... the adverse smelling Gurgi, the lovely and ever-perky Princess Eilonwy, the melody-changed bard Fflewddur Fflam, and the Fairy King Eidilleg.  Bad fortune and bad luck result in our band of heroes gaining a fantastic magic sword which they traded to three witches for the cauldron itself, only to discover they can't do anything with the cauldron and eventually losing control of the cauldron to the Horned King (and nearly their lives).  An unprecedented act of heroics saves the day and restores peace to the land.Disney's 25th feature film was seriously panned by critics and became a financial disaster... what is The Black Cauldron?  It's a hole Disney threw money in.  Lacking the charm and general sense of well-being ubiquitous in their other offerings, this more serious story failed to find wide acceptance.  As for me, I loved the movie and found Disney's plunge into darker story lines a refreshing change of pace and showed the company was capable of a greater degree of art than simply popcorn flicks and musicals.  The scenes dealing with the Fairy Folk are particularly enchanting - probably the most Disney-esque of the entire flick.  Perhaps if they had stuck closer to the original book they would have found greater success?  Who knows  - what I can say is this DVD has graced our shelves for more than a decade and we pull it down fairly regular.  Little Miss Movie Dude commented that when she was younger the movie scared the ""ba-gee-bees"" out of her but now she can appreciate the seriously great animation and the weaving of Welsh mythology with pure modern fantasy.What I loved:~ Dark and brooding, the story was a departure from more bubble-gum fluff-bunny Disney-fare~ Incredible animation from start to finish, this is one of the final films Disney put out pre-CGI films which sought to WOW us with the artistry of cell animation~ Little Miss Movie Dude loves all the magic in the film, she felt totally immersed and a genuine sense of wonder at all the magical goings on and itemsWhat I did NOT like:~ The story feels a little rough and choppy at times, I understand it went thru some last minute editing but I felt like was missing some of the polish and shine I'd expect from Disney~ The subject matter is very dark, and while I loved the film, I would probably caution families with small children to preview it firstHey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews.

442268,A3SJ5A6L2FRGGW,6304978286,Keith_Joseph,"[1, 1]","This is probably the darkest (literally) Disney cartoon made, even eclipsing Snow White for dismal castle scenes and skeletons. My daughter, then 7, simply didn't go for it and found it 'far too scary' towards the end - the Barbie and Cinderella films are more her bag. My son at the same age loved it however, and I quite enjoyed watching it with him as well. The story involves a young boy farmer (who has dreams of being a great warrior) and his magic pig, who both search for the mystical Black Cauldron. The scene with the three witches who guard the Black Cauldron is a highlight in a pretty consistent film (once the story gets going). OK, some of the characters, well one really, the Bard, are a bit wet, and occasionally the slapstick seems out of place, but the cosmic struggle between good (the farm-boy Taran) and evil (the Horned King) is well done and there a few nice touches. Personally I prefer the older 'Sword in the stone' though which has a similar feel, as it's also a medieval fantasy, although that one's relatively pig free. However do have a look at the excellent book this film was adapted from: The Black Cauldron (Chronicles of Prydain) by Lloyd Alexander, aimed squarely at preteen boys around 10 - it's part of a cult series of books first published in the 1960s.This film is strangely reminiscent of the earlier 1982 film - Conan the Barbarian, partcularly the tomb sequence where Taran finds the enchanted sword. Although this film is a little scary for little ones, the humour lightens the film considerably and it's no more frightening than Sheer Khan's sequences in The Jungle Book really. Overall I think many preteen children (more likely a boy I suspect) would enjoy watching 'The Black Cauldron' few times (but it's not for frequent viewing). It's probably not for teenager's either, who will no doubt prefer the likes of the new 'King Kong', `Batman Begins' and Harry Potter.",5,A dark film for under 5's - but great for older preteens (particularly boys),1166832000,"12 23, 2006",2006,1916,"['probably', 'darkest', 'literally', 'Disney', 'cartoon', 'made', 'even', 'eclipsing', 'Snow', 'White', 'dismal', 'castle', 'scenes', 'skeletons', 'daughter', 'then', '7', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'found', 'too', 'scary', 'end', 'Barbie', 'Cinderella', 'films', 'are', 'more', 'bag', 'son', 'same', 'age', 'loved', 'however', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'farmer', 'who', 'dreams', 'being', 'great', 'warrior', 'magic', 'pig', 'who', 'search', 'mystical', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'scene', 'three', 'witches', 'who', 'guard', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'highlight', 'pretty', 'consistent', 'film', 'story', 'going', 'OK', 'characters', 'well', 'one', 'really', 'Bard', 'are', 'bit', 'wet', 'occasionally', 'slapstick', 'place', 'cosmic', 'struggle', 'good', 'farm-boy', 'Taran', 'Horned', 'King', 'well', 'done', 'few', 'nice', 'touches', 'Personally', 'prefer', 'older', ""'Sword"", 'stone', 'similar', 'feel', 'also', 'medieval', 'fantasy', 'one', 'relatively', 'pig', 'free', 'However', 'do', 'have', 'look', 'excellent', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'adapted', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'Chronicles', 'Prydain', 'Lloyd', 'Alexander', 'aimed', 'squarely', 'preteen', 'boys', '10', 'part', 'cult', 'series', 'books', 'first', 'published', '1960s.This', 'film', 'strangely', 'reminiscent', 'earlier', '1982', 'film', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'partcularly', 'tomb', 'sequence', 'where', 'Taran', 'enchanted', 'sword', 'film', 'little', 'scary', 'little', 'ones', 'humour', 'film', 'considerably', 'more', 'frightening', 'Sheer', 'Khan', 'sequences', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'really', 'Overall', 'think', 'many', 'preteen', 'children', 'more', 'likely', 'boy', 'suspect', 'would', 'enjoy', 'watching', ""'The"", 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'few', 'times', 'not', 'frequent', 'viewing', 'probably', 'not', 'teenager', 'who', 'will', 'doubt', 'prefer', 'likes', 'new', ""'King"", 'Kong', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Harry', 'Potter']",The Black Cauldron Disney's Masterpiece  VHS

The books are so lovely that I purchased this video before seeing it, assuming that since Disney was given such great material to work with it would be a piece of art.  I was sorely dissapointed.  I suggest that any fan of the books stay away from this movie all together, or at least view it before you make the investment in purchasing it.  You'll find many important characters missing, and several key elements to the plot have changed.I feel that Disney would have done well to make the full series, rather than try and combine the events of The Book of Three and The Black Cauldron and cram them into one movie.However, Disney's version of The Black Cauldron does have its good points.  The animation is rather nice.  It's rather simple, but it serves its purpose very well.  It's a bit refreshing to see Disney make such a different movie from it's norm.  This one is very dark, and doesn't rely on song to pull you in.  The characters, while dissapointing if you're familiar with the books, are still portrayed rather interestingly in their own rights.  The Horned King is pretty well established, and early on you get a feeling that he just drips with evil.  Gurgi, although very different from his written counterpart, is a very loveable character, and brings a bright spot to the otherwise very gloomy feeling of the film.  The voice acting is good, the sound effects are of the highest quality, and the score does an adept job at setting the mood.If you are unfamiliar with the books, and watch the movie with an open mind, it can really be quite enjoyable, but it's noteworthy that this movie has a PG Rating, not the G Rating that most annimated Disney films feature.  There are some scenes that I find rather innapropriate for a children's film, including a scene where Fflewddur is changed into a toad and gets stuck in a woman's cleavage, and some of the scenes with The Horned King and the Cauldron-Born which may be very disturbing for sensitive children.

How could the wonderful, humorous, epic Lloyd Alexander books be reduced to this? Why couldn't a respectable movie studio have picked up the license, and made a worthy film with talented actors? The entire spectacle just made me sick.The very least Disney could have done would be to make a five-part series that covered all the books, but no. This is the only film there is, and it's not even based on The Black Cauldron. It's a muddled mix of that book (which was the second in the series) and The Book of Three (the first in the series). Blech.And then--I can barely type this--Gwydion (forgive me if I mispelled it...) isn't in it. At all. He's one of the best characters in the entire series, and he doesn't even get a supporting role!? And that's only the beginning of the heinous omissions. There's nothing about the race to find the Cauldron, the sad trading of the magical brooch, or Taran's swallowing his pride for the good of Prydain, and that's only mentioning a few. Instead, we have some half-baked trash where Taran slashes through hoards with the magic sword Dyrnwyn for a while (when in reality he can't even draw it until he's earned the right), then giving it to the witches so he can destroy the Cauldron. Then Gurgi jumps in the cauldron at the end, but is somehow brought back. By this time, I was trying to find a way to retch and watch the movie simultaneously.In all, this might be a decent movie to keep the kiddies occupied while you get the housework done, but why?

When I saw it again years later on video, I was like, &quot;What happened?&quot; What I saw on the video was what I didn't  see as a kid, a kid who was excited about the fantasy and adventure and the  amazing special effects of the movie.  I saw a boring, lifeless movie with  little or no heart and too much emphasis on being a dark, spooky fantasy  adventure.  The animators must've forgotten to breathe life into the  characters, because almost all of them are unmemorable and shallow.  Gurgi  steals the spotlight and also proves to be the most heroic, but at first he  comes off as just a silly creature and a thief.  The villain will frighten  young kids, and the movie tries to be scary just for the sake of being  scary.  There is no real drama here, only eerie effects and lots of living  skeletons.  Almost all of the conflict is external, and even then it's  cheap.  Equate The Black Cauldron to the stereotypical villain who laughs  cheesily at the captured heroes and reveals his plans to them before trying  to kill them, and you're not too far off.  Besides the fairy tales, Disney  must not have done a fantasy story before because in an attempt to make a  dark fantasy tale, they forgot to throw in the things important to all  tales.  With that said, it's certainly not the worst Disney movie.  I think  Hercules takes that honor.  A lot of people like The Black Cauldron, too,  so I'll take my chances and say rent it first.

The first book, The Book of Three, introduces all these characters as they unite to find Hen Wen and keep her from the Horned King. The Disney producers seems to have slammed these first two books together with little regard for Alexander's work except its popularity.Though in the books, these characters are complex, funny, and interesting, I found myself yawning five minutes into this film, because the screenplay strips away character in an attempt to graft in gags and evil castles. In the Book of Three, Taran's sword is taken away by the Princess, a sorcesses, because he hasn't the right to use it. Here, Taran is forced to become a swashbuckler instantly, without any development whatsoever. That was the point of the four books, to develop Taran into the character he becomes.I remember when this film came out, it tanked, hammering one more nail in the Disney coffin until the new regime came in and revived the animated feature.  It's hard to believe that the Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast come only a few years after this clunking, over-serious, archaic feature.That said, the artwork - the backgrounds mainly - is detail and often superb.  It's too bad that who ever transfered this over to DVD didn't care to clean up the negative. When this film shines, it can really shine. Also, don't watch TBC along with the Peter Jackson Fellowship of the Ring; too many shots are similar for comfort.The DVD does come with a Disney cartoon, ""Trick of Treat for Halloween"" which outshines the feature in every respect.

The movie at best is hard to follow along and jumps around a lot. The story begins with the introduction that claim that there was once was a ruler so evil that the only way to defeat him was to send his soul to the depth of the Black Cauldron where the Black Cauldron remained hidden for hundreds of years. The movie then switches to the scene of a small farm called Caer Dallben. Dallben is the guarding of Taran who is an Assistant Pigkeeper. Taran dreams of one day of being a great warrior and leaving the farm someday. Taran is feeding Hen Wen (a pig with special power) when Hen Wen acts ups and goes nuts Dallben orders Taran to bring Hen Wen inside. It is inside the Hen Wen powers are revealed. Hen Wen, when put under a spell, can see into the future and expose information. Dallben sees that the Horned King is after Hen Wen and orders Taran to take Hen Wen to the safe cottage on the other side of the woods. On the way to the cottage Taran loses Hen Wen and while looking for Hen Wen runs into Gurgi. Gurgi is a half human and half animal creature who is always hungry. Taran first think of Gurgi as annoying and useless and in the in Gurgi is loyal to Taran. Gurgi always call Taran master; the movie never explains why. Taran finds Hen Wen who is trying to escape from two flying dragons. Hen Wen is captured and is taken to the Horned King. Taran gives chase and finally reaches the castle of the Horned King only to be captured himself. Taran is forced to reveal to the Horned King the powers of Hen Wen. When Taran is in the middle of revealing to what the Horned King is seeking he grabs Hen Wen and tries to escape. Taran throws Hen Wen into the river before he is captured and thrown in the dungeon. In the dungeon he meets Princess Eilonwy who is an enchantress. Together they booth try to escape. In searching for the way out they discover the tomb of the king who used to own the castle and Taran takes the sword that was on top of his tomb. Taran claim it is of no use to him. Taran and Eilonwy find Fflewddur Fflam who is being held prisoner. Taran frees him and all three escape from the castle. While Eilonwy is sewing Fflewddur pants Gurgi emerges again and tells them he knows where the pig went. The trio follow Gurgi to a lake and all four a sucked below the lake where they arrive at the Isle of Mona. It is there that they find Hen Wen. The King tells them that they can find the Black Cauldron at Marshes of Morva. The people take Hen Wen back to Dallben while one of the King's assistant shows them where Morva is. At the home of the Three Witches, Taran trades his sword for the Black Cauldron and the witches tell them that the only why to defeat the Black Cauldron is that a life must willing give itself up and plunge into the Black Cauldron. With the bit of information the Three Witches leave. The four of them are by the campfire when the Horned King's warrior captures Taran, Eilonwy, and Fflewddur. Gurgi is able to avoid capture. At the castle of the Horned King, the king is able to bring his army of dead to life and sends them on a killing spree. Gurgi is able to sneak into the castle and free his friends. It is Gurgi whose sacrifice his life to destroy the Army of Dead. The Horned King returns to the Black Cauldron and tries to sacrifice Taran so he can bring his army back to life. Taran is able to defeat the Horned King and the Horned King dies at the mercy of the Black Cauldron. The trio makes their escape from the castle before it is destroyed. Once on land the Three Witches make their appearance again and try to reclaim the Black Cauldron. Fflewddur intervenes (the first time in the movie he has shown courage) and demands a trade for the Black Cauldron. At first they give the sword back but Taran realizes he is not a warrior but an Assistant Pig Keeper turns down the offer. In the end he bargains for the life of Gurgi. The Three Witches accept the bargain and bring Gurgi back to life and they get the Black Cauldron. In the end the four are head back to Caer Dallben. I had a very hard time trying to follow the movie. Also this movie was a first that this was not musical movie. In the past there would have been a least song, spoken or instrumental, is a Disney movie. Also not since Alice In Wonderland where there screen credits at the end of the movie. The Black Cauldron was a bust at the box office, but did manage to have a cult following in later years.

442283,A2XR8I2F15WNWT,6304978286,"MikeL ""Mike""","[23, 25]","To be honest, I didn't know what to expect when I popped The Black Cauldron: 25th Anniversary Edition into my DVD player. Sure, I've heard of it, but all I really knew is that it came from Disney's ""Dark Era"" (like The Great Mouse Detective), and that it takes place in a Tolkienesque world. And yes, The Black Cauldron is bold and different. This is not your average Disney fare.The story revolves around a young boy named Taran, an assistant pig keeper who dreams of one day becoming a hero. Of course, his daydreaming usually ends up getting him into trouble, like losing his pig, Hen Wen, to the Horned King (who looks like Skeletor's more competent older brother). Why would your-paint-by the-numbers Evil Overlord want a pig? Well, it turns out this pig is magic, and can tell the future and where things are. And since the Horned King is looking for the Black Cauldron, a magical object that will give him an army of undead walking skeletons, he wants said pig. So Taran goes on an epic quest to save his pig and destroy the Black Cauldron. Along the way, he is joined by a minstrel named Fflewddur Fflam, a princess named Eilonwy (apparently the Disney Princesses line completely forgot about her, just like everyone else), and a thing named Gurgi that looks like an Ewok and talks like Donald Duck. Through the course of their journey they encounter witches, Fair Folk, and other mystical creatures. Eventually, they have to face the Horned King himself.First off, I was really surprised to discover there was another Disney Princess I had never heard of, especially since this one is much closer in age to the Disney Princess line's target market. The next thing that stood out is how dark, violent and scary this movie is: its seems more like something up Ralph Bakshi's alley than Disney's. This may explain why it was a renowned flop; people have certain expectations for Disney films: It will have action and suspense, an exciting climax, and some patches of darkness, but the overall tone of the film is expected to be light. The Black Cauldron just isn't that kind of movie; it's still a children's movie, but it is definitely more geared for older kids.Another problem is that darker doesn't automatically equal better. In this case, the movie has a definite lack of enjoyable characters. Taran himself is a boring, bland, selfish, unlikable character who still manages to remind me too much of Arthur/Wart from The Sword in the Stone. Most of the characters are bland; those that aren't are stereotypes; and many are both. The only character with any personality is Gurgi, and he's the comic relief!Even when a Disney film suffers from bland heroes (I'm looking at you, Herc), a good villain can save the movie. They may be evil, but Gaston, Hades and Jafar are all have some sort of lightness to them, like you know you can't take them too seriously. The Horned King is nothing like that. He is dark, evil, quite, and just plain damn scary. In half of his scenes you can't even see his face. As a result you never feel a connection to him, and it leaves him feeling like just a clich&eacute;d, humorless villain. Even Judge Frollo, who was played straight and shown to have his own weaknesses to overcome, was compelling! The Horned King, not so.Its weak characters aside, The Black Cauldron does still manage to be exciting. I was expecting relatively mediocre animation, as in The Great Mouse Detective, but I was absolutely blown away by the visuals. The animation in this movie is some of the best I've ever seen, most notably a scene where Hen Wen is captured by dragons. The transfer on this particular DVD is brilliant, providing a nice full picture, surprisingly in CinemaScope (2.35:1 widescreen as opposed to most animated films that are 1.85:1 widescreen). The DVD also has both French and Spanish language tracks and subtitles and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Most of the special features are carried over from the previous release: ""Trick or Treat"" (an entertaining Donald Duck cartoon), ""The Quest for the Black Cauldron"" trivia game and a still frame gallery. The only new features on this disc are ""The Witches' Challenge"" game, which is essentially a rather dull Black Cauldron point-and-click riddle game, reminiscent of Dora the Explorer, and a deleted scene. For those hoping for the infamous ""man being dissolved by mist"" scene that was cut from the film for a better rating, prepare to be disappointed: the deleted scene in question here is an alternate, more boring version of when the gang meets the Fair Folk, and it's understandable why it was cut, as it would've definitely slowed the movie down. It's about ten minutes long and is told through storyboards and pencil tests. The rest of the DVD is filled out with previews for upcoming releases, and promos for DisneyFile Digital Copy and Disney Blu-ray (basically the Sprouse brothers explaining why Blu-ray is ""suite"". Their word, not mine).It's really quite a shame. Here we are, given a decent movie with a good transfer and practically no special features. This seems to be the case more and more often, as of late. Considering the troubled production this movie had, we should've at least had a retrospective documentary or a commentary. If you're like me and care about special features, I'd wait until the inevitable Blu-ray release several years down the road, though seeing how poorly Disney treats this film, I wouldn't be surprised if we get no special features there as well.Overall, The Black Cauldron is a decent fantasy movie, and an interesting experiment on the part of the Disney animation studio. Considering what a rarity it is--a dark Disney fantasy--it certainly deserves at least a rental, especially if you've never seen it before.",3,You should at least see it,1287273600,"10 17,

442284,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,6304978286,Monty Moonlight,"[2, 2]","Taran is a young pig-keeper growing up in the mystical, medieval land of Prydain. Actually, he's just an assistant pig-keeper, but he dreams of being a great warrior one day. When he discovers that the pig he keeps has magical powers to see the future, he is sent on a journey to hide little Henwyn from the terrifying and brutal Horned King. The evil, zombie-esque monarch has plans to use the pig's abilities to locate the Black Cauldron, a demonic, enchanted cauldron with the power to create an army of undead and unstoppable warriors. Not long after he embarks on his quest and encounters a mischievous and adorable woodland creature called Gurgi, Taran quickly loses Henwyn to the Horned King's flying beasts.  He then must venture into the castle of the Horned King himself to get Henwyn back. After a daring escape with the aid of a magic sword and a beautiful young princess held captive, Taran and his new friends, which also include an elderly minstrel they rescued from the dungeon, set forth in search of the Cauldron with plans to destroy it. Their travels lead them into an underground fairy world, to the home of the delightful and dangerous witches of Morva, and right back into the castle of the Horned King, where their worst fears become reality and only the most loving and unselfish act can save all!""The Black Cauldron,"" based on the Prydain books by Lloyd Alexander, is a must see film for the Disney and animation aficionado, despite how you feel about it afterwards. It comes from a very important transitional period at the Disney Studios, when most of the animators on staff were new to Disney filmmaking. The result is more of a technical accomplishment than anything else; an attempt by ambitious new animators to show off the extents of their talents and skills that... sorta blew up in their faces. In short, it's a good animated film, better than most non-Disney, American-made animated films, but one that is not quite up to the Disney standard in the storytelling department (like some of the very new stuff) and that was a huge disappointment to the Walt Disney Company in general.  ""The Black Cauldron"" was released in 1985, meaning this film came after ""The Fox and the Hound"" but before all that great Disney stuff from the late 80s and early 90s. Ever since the loss of Walt, the Disney Studios had been trying to get its groove back, and it took a while. In ""The Black Cauldron,"" we get a visually stunning film for its time, though the ""amazing visual effects"" are actually pretty dated by today's standards, and, though it's quite appropriate, the entire film has that same `80's fantasy film look and sound that so many others of the time had. It's a difficult thing to describe, but obviously there is a cult-like following for that style. And, there's a cult-like following for this film. It's been considered the black sheep of the Disney animated feature canon since its disappointing release, and this is actually pretty sad, because it deserves better than that. While it lacks a certain quality that can usually be found in Disney storytelling (perhaps it's just that shiny, happy, G-rated aspect that the film intentionally avoided which is missing), it is still an entertaining film (surprisingly similar to the Lord of the Rings saga in certain ways) that seems to get better with repeat viewings. Perhaps the character of Taran could have been more likeable, but Cauldron does, in my opinion, have the most charming Disney princess to date, the beautiful Princess Eilonwy. True, my favorite Disney girls are Ariel and Tink, but Eilonwy is right on that second tier with Belle and Kim Possible, and she truly is the most charming. It's a true crime that she isn't on all those posters and sleeping bags with the other princesses. In addition to the evil Horned King, voiced well by John Hurt, there's one other highly memorable character in the film: the creature known as Gurgi. This furry little critter, voiced by comedian John Byner (Transylvania 6-5000), is easily the star of the film. This is probably a major problem with the storytelling. He really shouldn't be the star. He's comic relief. Still, he's a loveable animal you won't soon forget, and at least he wasn't just comic relief for comic relief's sake. That is sometimes just flat-out annoying. I even have an old plush toy of him from the film's release, which is pretty cool to be able to say (I've got Henwyn too).Probably even more significant to this film's legendary status in Disney history than being a black sheep or claiming the first use of computer technology in a Disney animated film, is Disney's first straying from the usual formula, going for a much darker mood overall; going for that PG rating. This film is violent, occasionally vulgar, and surprisingly horrific at times. No singing dogs and cats here. In fact, I hear the producers actually cut some completed scenes they felt were TOO adult. I'd love to see that stuff on a future DVD release, but I don't expect to. This is probably the trouble with the Black Cauldron. It's not saccharine enough for little kiddies, but it may still be too cute  for most adults. It's an anomaly in that respect. It's like two completely different types of films: ""The Sword in the Stone"" meets ""Heavy Metal,"" without the rock `n' roll. It takes a real animation lover to enjoy it, I suppose. Oddly enough, despite the studio's desire to forget ""The Black Cauldron"" after it flopped in theaters, a very popular animated television series premiered from Disney a short time later with some far too clear similarities to the ""cute aspects"" of Cauldron. That show was ""Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears,"" and it truly was a great show, but it really is pretty much the Black Cauldron without the Cauldron, without the Horned King, and without any of the other dark, frightening stuff. They had characters VERY similar to Taran and Eilonwy (Princess Calla is another charming, beautiful, and overlooked Disney princess), multiplied Gurgi by 6 in the form of bouncy little bears (and added more later), put them in another medieval setting, and simply replaced the Horned King with a mustache twirling buffoon of a renegade knight who even had a little, green sidekick (as did the Horned King). Hey, the cutesey, G-rated formula worked. Here in the U.S., the idea that cartoons are just for kids is taking a LONG time to get over, even with some of the stuff we have today. Still, I loved the ""Adventures of the Gummi Bears.""Having ""The Black Cauldron"" on DVD is a real treat to watch again and again. It is not without its cool factor. There are some fantastically animated scenes that one is not used to seeing in a Disney film. I can't rave enough about sweet Eilonwy, and even if you don't like to experience it in excess, that `80's fantasy style is a real trip now and then. The film is presented in its original and glorious widescreen format, and the disc comes with a few great extras. You get a theatrical trailer, a trivia game, the Donald Duck CLASSIC short (and a Halloween season MUST WATCH) ""Trick or Treat,"" and some really cool galleries that include bits of a Tokyo Disneyland park attraction and even some development art by Tim Burton! Including the ""Trick or Treat"" cartoon was wonderful for the Disney animation fan! This is an old Donald Duck short where Huey, Louie, and Dewey are granted help from a kindly old Halloween witch to get their prank-playing uncle to part with some Halloween candy. It's a real fave! There's plenty to see in the galleries, but this is clearly not the whole enchilada. One keeps a glimmer of hope that ""The Black Cauldron"" will get a 2-disc release someday featuring even longer galleries (I especially like character development stuff), just as one holds out hope that Disney feature animation will once again find its lost ""groove"" for the current and future generations. In the meantime, if you are open-minded to animation that is a little more adult in theme, but not entirely, and if you like the fantasy genre, pick this fine edition up, but do it for yourself first, not for your kids. Unless you promise not to complain if they get scared or something! Remember, this is NOT your typical Disney animated film!",4,"A Black Sheep, But An Enjoyable One",969148800,"09 17, 2000",2000,8250,"['Taran', 'young', 'pig-keeper', 'growing', 'up', 'mystical',

442285,A35PJU0NW35EWK,6304978286,Mystery,"[0, 0]","Forget the negative reviews...these people obviously don't know how to appreciate a movie for what it is. This isn't meant to be a Disney ""princess"" movie...this is more of a boy's tale, although I'm a grown woman who loves it. For the babies out there who complain and compare Gurgi to Gollum, GROW UP. The two are nothing alike. Gollum is a cowardly villain; Gurgi becomes the biggest hero in this film. I'm sure these same complainers love ""Beauty and the Beast"", a much lauded Disney film, yet for me, THAT is far more dark and disturbing.Onto the movie: I never read the book this movie is based on, so I had no expectations about it. The story is about a pig keeper named Taran who has to save the world from a black cauldron after the evil Horned King gets hold of it. There is some darkness about it, but there's also an unexpected twist to make the happy ending more complete than it would've been.This movie came out in 1985, at the height of the '80s ""satanic panic""; parents saw some of the images and didn't take their kids to see this, nor did they think it was appropriate, and as a result, this movie bombed out at the box office. I don't know what age group should see this, but I do know that the fears of witchcraft and sorcery are ridiculous; this is a film that very much encourages and demonstrates good, heroism and ""doing the right thing"" in the boy and his friends, and they emerge victorious at the end. I think kids SHOULD see this precisely because of those latter things; the dark spots in the movie are brief and weak, and not that scary at all. There are no ""blood and guts"" gross moments in this movie. Its bad reputation is very undeserved. This is a film with great moral lessons such as love, friendship, loyalty, teamwork and sacrifice. Anyone who refuses to let their kids watch this because of the perceived ""darkness"" of it or because THEY don't like it are making their kids miss out on a great film.",5,A much-forgotten tale that needs more respect...,1404432000,"07 4, 2014",2014,1940,"['Forget', 'negative', 'reviews', 'people', 'obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'what', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'Disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'more', 'boy', 'tale', ""'m"", 'grown', 'woman', 'who', 'babies', 'who', 'complain', 'compare', 'Gurgi', 'Gollum', 'GROW', 'UP', 'two', 'are', 'nothing', 'alike', 'Gollum', 'cowardly', 'villain', 'Gurgi', 'biggest', 'hero', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'same', 'complainers', 'love', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'much', 'lauded', 'Disney', 'film', 'yet', 'THAT', 'far', 'more', 'dark', 'movie', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'had', 'expectations', 'story', 'pig', 'keeper', 'named', 'Taran', 'who', 'save', 'world', 'black', 'cauldron', 'evil', 'Horned', 'King', 'hold', 'darkness', 'also', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'make', 'happy', 'ending', 'more', 'complete', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been.This', 'movie', 'came', 'out', '1985', 'height', ""'80s"", 'satanic', 'panic', 'parents', 'saw', 'images', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'kids', 'see', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'appropriate', 'result', 'movie', 'bombed', 'out', 'box', 'office', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'age', 'group', 'should', 'see', 'do', 'know', 'fears', 'witchcraft', 'sorcery', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'encourages', 'good', 'heroism', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'boy', 'friends', 'emerge', 'victorious', 'end', 'think', 'kids', 'SHOULD', 'see', 'precisely', 'latter', 'things', 'dark', 'spots', 'movie', 'are', 'brief', 'weak', 'not', 'scary', 'are', 'blood', 'guts', 'gross', 'moments', 'movie', 'bad', 'reputation', 'very', 'undeserved', 'film', 'great', 'moral', 'lessons', 'such', 'love', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'teamwork', 'sacrifice', 'Anyone', 'who', 'let', 'kids', 'watch', 'perceived', 'darkness', 'THEY', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'are', 'making', 'kids', 'miss', 'out', 'great', 'film']",The Black Cauldron Disney's Masterpiece  VHS
442286,AQBHNE9AP6YBP,6304978286,NostalgiaVHS,"[0, 0]","I have to admit that my expectations were unfairly low for this movie. I grew up watching films from the Disney renaissance era such as The Lion King and Aladdin. It seems like the films made before this era such as The Fox and the Hound and The Black Cauldron got the shaft as far as longevity. Seems like most people don't remember these movies. Nobody I knew growing up ever had this movie on VHS, and it was never on TV. Honestly, I never cared to watch it until my recent Disney fixation. I was skeptical to rent it at first, but since I love other animated fantasy films such as Lord of the Rings and Fire & Ice, I decided to give it a watch.My first impression was that the animation is stunningly clear and crisp. The film is presented in its widescreen edition and the picture quality is mind-blowingly good for an 80's movie. It's definitely the excellent kind of quality you'd expect from a Disney film. The voice actors are British and came off a little goofy at first, but once the story got going it seemed to get more natural.The story in this film is very dark and there are a lot of parts that I would consider scary, or at least contains scary imagery such as skeletons and such. This was Disney's first PG rated animated film, and they did that to let parents know the film is a bit intense for kids. I wouldn't recommend showing this to a kid less than five years old unless you want them to get nightmares!I don't want to go over every detail of the plot because it's pretty thick, but basically there's an evil king who wants the black cauldron, and the only way he can find it is by using a psychic pig whose owner is the hero of our tale, Taran. He must protect the pig from the evil king at all cost. Seems like a simple task, right? Not so much. Things go wrong real fast and after that it's one exhilarating event after the next. The movie is very exciting in that there is constantly something going on to make the plot interesting.I suppose a quick-moving plot is one benefit to condensing an epic fantasy into an 80-minute family film, but there are many drawbacks to that as well. For example, there is an enormous amount of exposition in a movie like this, meaning that there is a lot of information to establish and not a lot of time to do it. The Black Cauldron does a good job of setting up the story in a quick way (one of the characters even references this by saying ""Too much, too soon!""). One of the issues with this is that character development is sacrificed in favor of the plot. This leaves us with characters who seem shallow with little emotional complexity. Think how other Disney characters have some inner conflict that defines their character. In Beauty and the Beast, Belle has a deep desire to experience new places even though she is stuck in quiet little town, or how about how Aladdin longs to fulfill his potential when he is labeled a street rat. Taran's conflict is that he is a pig-farmer who dreams of being a hero, but it is not clearly established like in the other films, nor does the audience ever see this is an emotional issue for the character.In the end characterization isn't the most important thing to consider when reviewing a movie like this. There ar aplenty of cute sidekick characters spread throughout the film to keep the kids and kid-like adults happy with comic relief antics. One of my personal favorite characters is the King's wacky assistant. Why do evil kings in movies always have bumbling idiots as their assistants?  There's also very little cutesy moments or forced sentimentality like in a lot of other Disney flicks, which I appreciate.The visuals in this films are absolutely stunning. Aside from the animation itself, there are many visual effects in the film that contribute immensely to the overall experience. There were several moments in the film, such as the thrilling finale, where I was completely mesmerized by what I saw seeing on my screen. If you can stream this to your TV instead of your laptop I highly recommend you do so.As a 21-year old animation fan, I really enjoyed this movie. This is definitely an under-appreciated flick that I think more people should be aware of. I mean, it is a fully legitimate Disney animated feature, and by golly it deserves respect! Seriously though, the film has amazing visuals, a throughly engaging story, and some truly funny moments.If you've never seen The Black Cauldron then I hope you decide to give it a shot like I did. You won't be disappointed (probably).",4,A Fine-crafted Fantasy,1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,4510,"['have', 'admit', 'expectations', 'were', 'unfairly', 'low', 'movie', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'films', 'Disney', 'renaissance', 'era', 'such', 'Lion', 'King', 'Aladdin', 'films', 'made', 'era', 'such', 'Fox', 'Hound', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'got', 'shaft', 'as', 'far', 'longevity', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'movies', 'Nobody', 'knew', 'growing', 'up', 'ever', 'had', 'movie', 'VHS', 'was', 'never', 'TV', 'Honestly', 'never', 'cared', 'watch', 'recent', 'Disney', 'fixation', 'was', 'skeptical', 'rent', 'first', 'love', 'other', 'animated', 'fantasy', 'films', 'such', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Fire', 'Ice', 'decided', 'give', 'watch.My', 'first', 'impression', 'was', 'animation', 'stunningly', 'clear', 'crisp', 'film', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'edition', 'picture', 'quality', 'mind-blowingly', 'good', '80', 'movie', 'definitely', 'excellent', 'kind', 'quality', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Disney', 'film', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'British', 'came', 'off', 'little', 'goofy', 'first', 'once', 'story', 'got', 'going', 'seemed', 'get', 'more', 'natural.The', 'story', 'film', 'very', 'dark', 'are', 'lot', 'parts', 'would', 'consider', 'scary', 'least', 'contains', 'scary', 'imagery', 'such', 'skeletons', 'such', 'was', 'Disney', 'first', 'PG', 'rated', 'animated', 'film', 'did', 'let', 'parents', 'know', 'film', 'bit', 'intense', 'kids', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'showing', 'kid', 'less', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'want', 'get', 'nightmares', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'over', 'detail', 'plot', 'pretty', 'thick', 'basically', 'evil', 'king', 'who', 'black', 'cauldron', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'find', 'using', 'psychic', 'pig', 'owner', 'hero', 'tale', 'Taran', 'must', 'protect', 'pig', 'evil', 'king', 'cost', 'simple', 'task', 'right', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'Things', 'go', 'wrong', 'real', 'fast', 'one', 'exhilarating', 'event', 'next', 'movie', 'very', 'exciting', 'constantly', 'something', 'going', 'make', 'plot', 'interesting.I', 'suppose', 'quick-moving', 'plot', 'one', 'benefit', 'condensing', 'epic', 'fantasy', '80-minute', 'family', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'drawbacks', 'as', 'well', 'example', 'enormous', 'amount', 'exposition', 'movie', 'meaning', 'lot', 'information', 'establish', 'not', 'lot', 'time', 'do', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'good', 'job', 'setting', 'up', 'story', 'quick', 'way', 'one', 'characters', 'even', 'references', 'saying', 'Too', 'much', 'too', 'soon', 'One', 'issues', 'character', 'development', 'sacrificed', 'favor', 'plot', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'shallow', 'little', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'Think', 'how', 'other', 'Disney', 'characters', 'have', 'inner', 'conflict', 'character', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Belle', 'deep', 'desire', 'experience', 'new', 'places', 'even', 'stuck', 'quiet', 'little', 'town', 'how', 'how', 'Aladdin', 'longs', 'fulfill', 'potential', 'when', 'labeled', 'street', 'rat', 'Taran', 'conflict', 'pig-farmer', 'who', 'being', 'hero', 'not', 'clearly', 'established', 'other', 'films', 'audience', 'ever', 'see', 'emotional', 'issue', 'character.In', 'end', 'characterization', ""n't"", 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'consider', 'when', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'ar', 'aplenty', 'cute', 'sidekick', 'characters', 'spread', 'film', 'keep', 'kids', 'kid-like', 'adults', 'happy', 'comic', 'relief', 'antics', 'One', 'personal', 'favorite', 'characters', 'King', 'wacky', 'assistant', 'Why', 'do', 'evil', 'kings', 'movies', 'always', 'have', 'bumbling', 'idiots', 'assistants', 'also', 'very', 'little', 'cutesy', 'moments', 'forced', 'sentimentality', 'lot', 'other', 'Disney', 'flicks', 'appreciate.The', 'visuals', 'films', 'are', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'Aside', 'animation', 'are', 'many', 'visual', 'effects', 'film', 'contribute', 'immensely', 'overall', 'experience', 'were', 'several', 'moments', 'film', 'such', 'thrilling', 'finale', 'where', 'was', 'completely', 'mesmerized', 'what', 'saw', 'seeing', 'screen', 'can', 'stream', 'TV', 'instead', 'laptop', 'highly', 'recommend', 'do', 'so.As', '21-year', 'old', 'animation', 'fan', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'definitely', 'under-appreciated', 'flick', 'think', 'more', 'people', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'mean', 'fully', 'legitimate', 'Disney', 'animated', 'feature', 'golly', 'respect', 'Seriously', 'film', 'amazing', 'visuals', 'throughly', 'engaging', 'story', 'truly', 'funny', 'moments.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'then', 'hope', 'decide', 'give', 'shot', 'did', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'probably']",The Black Cauldron Disney's Masterpiece  VHS

442291,AJ4TG9LNSB0Y4,6304978286,"Robert M. ""Professional Nerd""","[0, 3]","(Done as an extensive summary review, with commentary. Spoilers follow.)On a whim, I decided to take a look at one of Disney's more infamous endeavors, the 1985 film The Black Cauldron. I was curious about this film because it has a reputation for being one of, if not the worst animated films in the Walt Disney Animated Classics line. Granted it was the first animated Disney film to get a PG rating, so it's definitely a deviation from the norm, but that doesn't mean it's terrible ... right? Nonetheless, I went into it with an open mind. I did not come out as such.As one of the many aspects of this film's unusual nature, is based on a series of fantasy novels rather than Disney's usual go-to gag of common fairytales. The Black Cauldron is based on the first two entries in the series of novels known as The Chronicles of Prydain, published from 1964 to 1968, the first being The Book of Three and the other being The Black Cauldron itself. That being said, I cannot in any way comment on this film on its merits or faults as an adaptation, seeing as how I have never read this particular series of books, nor had I even heard of it before researching this film. So, I will just have to take this film as it is. Still, the fact that I had never even heard of this film's basis cannot possibly be a good sign.The overall plot of this film is as basic and unenlightened as it could possibly get. The opening narration gives us a standard back story of some ancient evil sealed away in the mystic ""MacGuffin,"" the Black Cauldron. We then moved to the Shire standard farmstead, where we see the standard young and inexperienced wannabe hero, Luke Taran. He is being looked over by Obi-Wan Kenobi Gandalf Dallben. For the record, I'll say that Dallben's voice, provided by Freddie Jones, sounds fairly strained, but perhaps maybe they were going for to give him more of a venerated feel, or possibly it just might be the limitations of the recording equipment of the mid-80s. Speaking of that, this film actually feels a lot older than it actually is, like it's contemporary with films like The Sword in the Stone and The Jungle Book, despite the fact that it's actually nearly 20 years older than those films. The animation style of this film is sketchy, like it's not fully polished, which was common in previous decades, but should have been phased out by this time. It's decent, but nowhere near impressive. Characters and moving objects stand out too much from the backgrounds; I even know which rocks they will step on. Perhaps this is a frame rate or conversion issue, but it does bear noticing. For the most part, the backgrounds do look nice and well-painted, but they're not that noteworthy.Back to the actual plot, or what little there is. Taran's main job is to take care of Hen Wen, a magical pig that can see visions of the future when she sees her reflection in water . . . Okay. Weird, but I have heard of weirder. How or why she has this power is never explained though, something you'll find to be a recurring trope in this film, unfortunately. Taran dreams of being a great hero and is tired of his life on the farm, much like every other young hero and every other fantasy tale ever written. He gets his chance when Hen Wen sees a vision of the Horned King during one particular acid water trip. The Horned King is a mixed character, in my opinion. He can be scary looking, especially for small children, seeing as how he looks like a cross between Skeletor and a Ringwraith with deer antlers. His voice can also be intimidating, seeing as how it is provided by the legendary John Hurt, and there is a frightening error about him, especially in the way that he's talked about and how his minions fear his wrath. However, there doesn't seem to be anything particularly impressive about his actual being; he doesn't seem like a particularly strong or powerful villain, but were supposed to just believe that he is one were told so. Also, exactly who or what he is, and where he came from are never really elaborated upon. All that we do know, is that he is evil and wants to take over the world with an army of the undead (yeah, zombies in a Disney movie), and in order do that, he needs the Black Cauldron, which has been lost for centuries. At any rate, Taran now has to take Hen Wen to the safe haven of It-Doesn't-Matter-Because-They're-Obviously-Never-Going-To-Get-There.So Taran takes Hen Wen into the nearby woods, where he spends most of his time on daydreaming about being a great hero some more. I must say that Taran seems far more full of himself and much less competent than other heroes in his position from other tales. He boasts with the ego of a professional wrestler, yet we've never actually seen him do anything. Moreover, he screws up at the first chance he gets as Hen Wen disappears while he is busy fantasizing. As if that wasn't bad enough, he then meets Gurgi, our Gollum impersonator for the evening. Gurgi is much more annoying than most fantasy companions, like almost Jar Jar level annoying. His voice and manner of speech does sound very much like Gollum's, but it's somehow much more grating and gets on your nerves very fast. They find Hen Wen, but she is quickly captured by the Horned King's dragon minions. Gurgi points Taran in the direction of the Horned King's castle, but is too scared to go with him. I must say that Taran is unusually harsh on a creature he just met in this scene, seeing as how it's mostly his fault that bad stuff happened anyway; it doesn't give the audience much sympathy for a hero that is so callous to others.Taran gets to the castle. The animation of this scene, which you can practically play ""Cantina Jizz"" to like any other bar scene in fantasy stories, is oddly fluid and chaotic; doesn't match the rest of the picture very well. Again, Taran takes another step down in the minds of the audience, as his bravado falls at his first confrontation with the Horned King. So much for all that boasting. However, I will grant that he at least gets Hen Wen out of the castle, but by throwing her off a balcony into the moat, so he can't even do that right. He's thrown in the dungeon, but he quickly meets a young girl named Princess Eilonwy, who frees him from his cell and then explore the dungeons together, looking for an exit. Princess Eilonwy is another character that I'm not sure how I feel about. She seems a bit too unconcerned or absent-minded, and I can't put my finger on it, but she doesn't seem likable like, say, Alice was. She seems like an active sort of Princess, in that she is trying to do things for herself, but like Taran, she doesn't seem very capable. Also, she has some magic light ball Navi thing that follows her around. What it is, what it does, where it came from, also never brought up. And another thing, no mention of her royal family, or her kingdom for that matter, are ever made, so there is not much point to her being a princess other than just for the sake of being a princess in a Disney movie; she could just as easily been a laundry made in the story would be no different. Anyway, the pair also find a trapped bard, named Fflewddur Fflam (which is a stupid name), who is only mildly annoying. His voice actor, Nigel Hawthorne, would later do much better work for Disney as Professor Porter in Tarzan. Taran also comes across a magical Excalibur-like sword in a tomb, which can apparently cut through anything and they use it to escape the castle. Again, where the sword came from and why it was in the Horned King's dungeon is never addressed. This new development only serves to inflate Taran's ego to Kanye West-level proportions, but at least it Eilonwy is practical and sees that the sword did all the work. Taran is like this and lashes out verbally at her with some s very sexist remarks. Wow, Taran is a jerk. I'm rooting for him less and less as this movie goes on, if I ever was to begin with. Also, they meet up with Gurgi again. Oh, joy.Next, they encounter these fairy/Smurf things called Fair Folk, who happen to have recovered Hen Wen. Well, that's a convenient deus ex machine, isn't it? I will point out that the young Fair Folk are actually voiced by children, which is a point for authenticity, but they clearly don't know what they're doing, and thus don't do a very good job acting; it's clear that they're reading, and not very well at that. I can't really blame them though, seeing as how they're just kids, but this is noticeable and distracting enough to bear mentioning. The Fair Folk say that they'll take Hen Wen back to the farm, and that's the last we ever see of her, so a lot of good her character did, aside from just instigate the plot. One of these Fair Folk agreed to escort the group to the location of the Black Cauldron. So where has this Black Cauldron, this incredibly dangerous evil artifact of unbelievable power, been hidden for all this time? In some cave, guarded by a monster? In a distant temple, surrounded by dozens of traps? Nope. Some witches had it in the back of their house, which is in some swamp. Kind of a letdown. These three witches (who obviously are analogs of the three witches in the opening scene of Macbeth) agreed to trade the Black Cauldron for Taran magic sword, who is obviously reluctant to part with the only thing that is given him any sort of credibility, but he eventually agrees to make the trade. Wow, it was so hard to obtain that inconceivably dangerous apocalyptic evil artifact, like bargaining at a swap meet. The witches cackle and say that the Black Cauldron will be of no use to them, because it is indestructible and the only way to stop it is to sacrifice someone who's willing to jump in. Well, that's a bit of a downer. At any rate, they still have to keep the black cauldron out of the hands of the Horned King, so obviously they try to hide it or something, right? Nope. They just sit there. They make a campfire and roast marshmallows and mope. Our heroes, everybody! So proactive! So, obviously the Horned King's goons come in and take it without much of a fuss. Seriously, what are these people good for? They've done essentially nothing for the entire film! Taran whines that he's nothing without his magic sword. Well, he's right, but for some inexplicable reason, Eilonwy says that she believes in him. Why? He has never given her, or us as the audience for that matter, any reason to believe that he's capable of anything at any point in this film. At any rate, they head back to the Horned King's castle.Back at the castle, the horned King has activated the Black Cauldron. Green smoke flows out of it and animates his army of dead soldiers. I will say that this scene is pretty cool. There was very early CGI effects done on the cauldron and the smoke, and it looks very impressive for the time, almost photogenic. Also, I can see why this film got a PG rating; the images of the rotting undead minions, oozing blood and lava, rising up and marching would definitely frighten younger viewers, but adults would find it pretty cool. The Horned King exclaims he's moments away from victory. Why would he think that? His army hasn't done anything yet; they haven't conquered anyone or anything, and they haven't even gone a hundred yards outside of the castle. At any rate, the group gets to the Cauldron (which is completely unguarded for some stupid reason) and Taran, to his little credit, seems willing to jump in and sacrifice himself to stop it, but Gurgi rushes ahead and beats him to it. Yes! At least that annoying furball was good for something. So, the Horned King's plan is thwarted and his undead army collapses before it's barely even out of the gate. You know, for all that the Black Cauldron was built up to be, it doesn't really do anything, and moreover, it stopped unusually simply, so this thing doesn't amount to much in any respect for all its foreshadowing. I will say that in this scene, the Horned King gets angry and his eyes turn red with narrow black dots for pupils, and I must admit that he is much scarier and cooler-looking like this. His death is also disgustingly simple; he's sucked into the cauldron and melts into it, sort of like the Ark of the Covenant from Raiders of the Lost Ark, only in reverse.As typical of evil villain lairs, as soon as the final boss is defeated, the whole place collapses/self-destructs for no reason. The three humans rush to escape the castle through the moat in the dungeon. There's a particularly bad edit in this sequence. There way is blocked by a gate, so Taran gets out of their boat to open it, but in the very next shot, the gate is closed again. When Taran opened it, it was lightly colored because he was interacting with it, but in the next shot, it's part of the painted background of the antecedent shot. It'll make you do a double-take. At any rate, they all escape unscathed, naturally. The witches from earlier suddenly reappear and offer to take the Black Cauldron off of their hands, seeing as how it is of no use to anyone anymore. Fflewddur Fflam, in literally the only useful thing he's done in this film, insists that they trade for it. The head witch reluctantly offers Taran his magic sword back in exchange for the cauldron, but all he wants is his friend Gurgi back. The witches say that such a feat is impossible, so they obviously then immediately proceed to do it. So that annoying furball is alive again, just when you thought you got rid of him, Taran and Eilonwy obligatorily kiss because the scripts demands it, and they all live happily ever after, with Dallben and Hen Wen, who have been entirely useless throughout this entire film, look on.The DVD extras are there, and that's all I can really say about them. There are a couple of point-and-click games with trivia and very simple puzzles, which are extraordinarily easy; it might entertain a five-year-old for a few minutes but won't do anything for anybody else. There is an old Donald Duck Halloween cartoon short included, and that's pretty good, for what it's worth. There is a deleted scene, but unfortunately, it's not from any of the 12 minutes that were supposedly cut from this film postproduction personally by Jeffrey Katzenberg. Instead it's just another partially animated storyboard animatic from the Fair Folk scene, which I found to be disappointing in light of what could have very easily been an extensive deleted scenes extra.Overall, everything about this film screams average, and the low end of average at that. The story just seems to sort of happen to the characters, rather than the characters driving the plot. Nobody seems very active. The story itself is the classic fantasy hero's journey that we've all seen a hundred times before, and it doesn't really bring anything new to the formula to justify its own existence. A lot of the characters and objects function only as plot devices, and are not very well explained or elaborated upon. The main hero isn't particularly skilled or even likable, the side characters are mostly useless and kind of annoying, and the villain is kind of good but it only serves to illuminate that he could've been much better. For a Disney film, I was very underwhelmed by this film. The animation isn't stellar or amateur, it's just average; its characters are not outright good and interesting or even bad, just average; the plot also isn't particularly innovative or negatively derivative, it's just average. And for Disney, average means ""skip it,"" and you should skip this film. The Disney studios have done much better before this film and after it. Unless you really want to have a complete Disney Animated Classics collection, you aren't really missing much if you leave this one out of it.",3,"Unless you're a diehard Disney collector, you can

I wish they would make a live action of that movie but more mature, even though it was already kinda dark. I mean the horned king was an immortal skeleton, he raised an army of the undead, and he had one of the best disney villian deaths! They also deleted a bunch of scenes that were too graphic like one of the undead slicing a mans neck and torso and a man being desolved by the mist which they will probably never feature under the deleted scenes. I bet a live action movie would be creepy as hell! It was based on the series chronicles of prydain but in it the horned king was just a man and not even the main bad guy at that, so disney's version of him was way coole! But it seems they couldn't  develop the characters to make them interesting enough to care about them.My favorite characters included the horned king, creeper, gurgi and Fflewddur with his mandoline.

442295,A2670J1X1SRWGQ,6304978286,"""roxio_cleese""","[23, 34]","I've never read the books on which the film is based, but the action and dialogue have the nervous, half-apologetic opacity of a screenplay too hastily cut-and-pasted out of a more complex work.  Like the Rankin-Bass Return of the King, crucial motivations and important relationships are poorly established or not explained at all, long journeys are reduced to a two-second transition shot, and the exposition manages to be both half-hearted and desperate.  Unlike The Return of the King, the bad comic relief is rampant.  Several characters seem to have been rewritten entirely as tiresome jokes (can the minstrel really have been that useless and goofy?  Could the witches have been such feeble caricatures?)In a movie in which nearly everything is handled poorly,  the villain fares perhaps worst of all, because he has such tremendous potential.  A death's-headed sorcerer who uses the eponymous cauldron to raise an army of the undead, he ought to be monstrous and terrifying.  And while he looks nasty enough, and delivers a lot of speeches about ""the cauldron-born"" that in theory should send chills down the spines of small children, he seems to inspire little fear in the inhabitants of the movie.  They all talk about his dread majesty, of course, but scene after scene shows him striding into a room full of boisterous henchmen who, far from being in awe of their evil master,  barely seem to notice him at all, and do not even stop eating when he speaks.  His second-in-command or Generic Comic Sidekick is terrified of him, but only because he is constantly bashing him over the head.  Even the hero, an untested young boy, barely balks in his presence.  The man has no menace about him.  He might as well settle down and start reading romance novels, because he's exactly as scary as the Elephant Man. He probably needs an army of the undead just to maintain order in the Castle of Evil.Also abominable is the film's treatment of Gurgi, the fluffy nothing who begins as odious comic relief and stays odious comic relief until precisely the moment he is needed for a heroic self-sacrifice.  It turns out that for obscure EVIL reasons of its own, the Cauldron (which has to be destroyed so that the dead can stop walking and the Horned King can get back to whatever it is he does when not covering all the lands in darkness) needs someone's life given willingly.  Gurgi, a useless bit of window dressing not unlike that annoying hummingbird in Pocahontas (only with the added inconvenience of speech) has been rejected by the heroes of the movie as cumbersome and silly and for contributing absolutely nothing to the plot.  So he's feeling a little sad and lonely, and so just when you think that one of the heroes is going to sacrifice himself to the Cauldron for the salvation of the world, the little Ewok comes panting out in front of everybody, announces, ""Gurgi has no friends.  Gurgi will die,"" or some such thing, and cannonballs into the Cauldron, just like that-- thus granting cinema perhaps the least thoughtful suicide in its history.  Well, all right.  But if you thought just because The Black Cauldron was rated PG that it would let its odious comic relief stay dead, think again.  No sooner has the undead army been swirled back into the earth than Gurgi is found, coughing and wheezing but very much alive.  What, did the Cauldron have pity on him or something?  Pretty sentimental for an EVIL artifact, especially considering that nobody else really liked Gurgi to begin with.  The entire sequence-- the seeming arbitrariness of Gurgi's sacrifice and his subsequent (and equally arbitrary) resurrection, would have sunk a much better movie.  Here, it's just one more in a long string of bad decisions.The overall failure of the movie, however, is a consistent and difficult to explain failure of tone.  Technically, all the elements are there for a competent Disney movie-- except that the adventure isn't exciting, the humor isn't funny, the heroes are colorless and seem to act almost at random, and the villain is peculiarly unimpressive.  In fact, the entire movie appears to have been written, directed, and edited by an early experiment in artificial intelligence.  The computer was given a few books and the Disney formula and instructed to make a hit movie.  The result is a novelty, but not a success.

Disney could have spent a little less on special effects and hired a screenwriter.It gets 2 stars rather than 1 star only because it served as a prototype (only with respect to special effects) to Disney's renaissance animation (Little Mermaid, Beauty &amp; the Beast, et. al.).",2,This Lost Classic.................,972432000,"10 25, 2000",2000,652,"['should', 'have', 'stayed', 'lost.Sorry', 'Disney', 'fans', 'saw', 'Radio', 'City', 'Hall', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'premiere', 'week', 'What', 'disappointment', 'animation', 'was', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'failed', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'Instead', 'movie', 'consisted', 'very', 'loud', 'rumbles', 'crashes', 'special', 'effects', 'characters', 'were', 'one-dimensional', 'lacking', 'warmth', 'depth', 'Disney', 'could', 'have', 'spent', 'little', 'less', 'special', 'effects', 'hired', 'screenwriter.It', '2', 'stars', 'rather', '1', 'star', 'only', 'served', 'prototype', 'only', 'respect', 'special', 'effects', 'Disney', 'renaissance', 'animation', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Beauty', 'amp', 'Beast', 'et', 'al']",The Black Cauldron Disney's Masterpiece  VHS

442305,A37NL9EDUT23IV,6304978286,"takemehome ""Joey""","[8, 10]","EDIT: Although Disney has yet to announce a release date, The Black Cauldron WILL be reissued in a new Special Edition DVD. Hopefully this will include a restored transfer and some new bonuses. Already advertised have been a new game as well as deleted scenes. Whether these are the infamous deleted scenes of completed animation or not remains to be seen. This is why Disney has discontinued this inferior DVD.I'm not going to go into detail about the movie, its plot, its troubled history, etc. You can find that just about anywhere you look online for this film. I'm strictly going to discuss the DVD. This DVD has several pros and cons that you might consider before buying.Pros:-The movie is presented in its original 70MM widescreen aspect ratio for the first time since its original theatrical release.-The DVD contains an incredible Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround track.-Although not listed ANYWHERE on the packaging, the original theatrical trailer is included, very scratchy and in fullscreen-The Quest For The Black Cauldron Game is quite a bit of fun. Not as fun as other Disney DVD set-top games, but better than your average trivia DVD game.-A great still-frame gallery is included - our only glimpse into the making of the movie.-The DVD includes the great Donald Duck cartoon Trick Or Treat.Cons:-The film is presented in a 4:3 letterboxed transfer instead of a 16:9 letterboxed transfer.-The film obviously hasn't been given any type of restoration, cleanup, or anything of that matter. Dirt, scratches, and flickering, while not a complete nuisance, are more present than one would like.-Apart from the photo gallery, there is NOTHING on here that gives the consumer any insight into the making of the film.-Although the theatrical trailer is present, it would have been nice had Disney also included some TV spots and the trailer from the 1985 VHS release of Pinocchio, which is said to contain some of the deleted footage from the film.-Speaking of the deleted footage, if not restored into the film itself, they could have at least included it as a bonus feature, with some info on why it was deleted and such. Preferably shown edited into where it'd be in the film so as to be placed into context.-I'm not sure if this is an issue with everyone, but on my RCA DVD player, when chapter 12 ends, instead of simply going into chapter 13, it skips to chapter 14 and I have to skip back to chapter 13 in order to watch it. I wouldn't bother mentioning this, except I returned my first copy in exchange for a new one, and the new one did the same thing. It's a shame that Disney cares so little for this movie that they allowed mass quantities of the DVD to go out with a glitch like this and instead of recalling them and fixing the problem, they just let them be sold. While at least I won't MISS any of the movie, it still ruins the flow of the film to have to rewind to view the skipped chapter. Hopefully, this isn't a problem for most DVD players.Considering that Disney is starting to reissue some of its Gold Classic Collection discs with new transfers, new bonus materials, etc., hopefully they'll give The Black Cauldron the same consideration. A new transfer shouldn't be difficult, since the film HAS been restored and made into an anamorphic widescreen transfer. (This version has currently only seen the light of day in France.) Despite the fact that The Black Cauldron was one of Disney's most troubled and financially disappointing productions in the history of the studio, it's since developed a loyal, if small, following, and a new DVD release with some additional trailers/TV ads, SOME kind of making-of material, a freshened up 16:9 enhanced widescreen transfer, and all that good stuff (Maybe even a music-only track to show off Elmer Bernstein's magnificent score.) would be a nice way to acknowledge that yes, there ARE people out there who would actually LIKE a better DVD of this film. Meanwhile, I'm not holding my breath for it anytime soon, so for now, I'll make do with this Gold Collection Edition DVD with its passable transfer, all the while being grateful that they at least bothered to present it in its original widescreen format. I guess I'll give kudos to Disney at least for that...and for the fact that it's seen the light of day on any home video format at all in the US.",3,I think it's time for Disney gave this title an upgrade.,1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,4324,"['EDIT', 'Disney', 'yet', 'announce', 'release', 'date', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'WILL', 'be', 'reissued', 'new', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'include', 'restored', 'transfer', 'new', 'bonuses', 'Already', 'advertised', 'have', 'been', 'new', 'game', 'as', 'well', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'infamous', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'completed', 'animation', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'why', 'Disney', 'discontinued', 'inferior', 'DVD.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'detail', 'movie', 'plot', 'troubled', 'history', 'etc', 'can', 'find', 'just', 'about', 'anywhere', 'look', 'online', 'film', ""'m"", 'strictly', 'going', 'discuss', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'several', 'pros', 'cons', 'might', 'consider', 'buying.Pros', '-The', 'movie', 'presented', 'original', '70MM', 'widescreen', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'first', 'time', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release.-The', 'DVD', 'incredible', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Surround', 'track.-Although', 'not', 'listed', 'ANYWHERE', 'packaging', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'included', 'very', 'scratchy', 'fullscreen-The', 'Quest', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'Game', 'quite', 'bit', 'fun', 'Not', 'as', 'fun', 'other', 'Disney', 'DVD', 'set-top', 'games', 'better', 'average', 'trivia', 'DVD', 'game.-A', 'great', 'still-frame', 'gallery', 'included', 'only', 'glimpse', 'making', 'movie.-The', 'DVD', 'great', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'cartoon', 'Trick', 'Or', 'Treat.Cons', '-The', 'film', 'presented', '4:3', 'letterboxed', 'transfer', 'instead', '16:9', 'letterboxed', 'transfer.-The', 'film', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'been', 'given', 'type', 'restoration', 'cleanup', 'anything', 'matter', 'Dirt', 'scratches', 'flickering', 'not', 'complete', 'nuisance', 'are', 'more', 'present', 'one', 'would', 'like.-Apart', 'photo', 'gallery', 'NOTHING', 'here', 'consumer', 'insight', 'making', 'film.-Although', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'present', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'had', 'Disney', 'also', 'included', 'TV', 'spots', 'trailer', '1985', 'VHS', 'release', 'Pinocchio', 'said', 'contain', 'deleted', 'footage', 'film.-Speaking', 'deleted', 'footage', 'not', 'restored', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'included', 'bonus', 'feature', 'info', 'why', 'was', 'deleted', 'such', 'Preferably', 'shown', 'edited', 'where', ""'d"", 'be', 'film', 'so', 'be', 'placed', 'context.-I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'issue', 'everyone', 'RCA', 'DVD', 'player', 'when', 'chapter', '12', 'ends', 'instead', 'simply', 'going', 'chapter', '13', 'chapter', '14', 'have', 'skip', 'back', 'chapter', '13', 'order', 'watch', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother', 'mentioning', 'returned', 'first', 'copy', 'exchange', 'new', 'one', 'new', 'one', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'shame', 'Disney', 'so', 'little', 'movie', 'allowed', 'mass', 'quantities', 'DVD', 'go', 'out', 'glitch', 'instead', 'recalling', 'fixing', 'problem', 'just', 'let', 'be', 'sold', 'least', 'wo', ""n't"", 'MISS', 'movie', 'still', 'flow', 'film', 'have', 'rewind', 'view', 'skipped', 'chapter', 'Hopefully', ""n't"", 'problem', 'most', 'DVD', 'players.Considering', 'Disney', 'starting', 'reissue', 'Gold', 'Classic', 'Collection', 'discs', 'new', 'transfers', 'new', 'bonus', 'materials', 'etc.', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'same', 'consideration', 'new', 'transfer', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'difficult', 'film', 'HAS', 'been', 'restored', 'made', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'version', 'currently', 'only', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'France', 'fact', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'was', 'one', 'Disney', 'most', 'troubled', 'financially', 'disappointing', 'productions', 'history', 'studio', 'developed', 'loyal', 'small', 'following', 'new', 'DVD', 'release', 'additional', 'trailers/TV', 'ads', 'SOME', 'kind', 'making-of', 'material', 'freshened', 'up', '16:9', 'enhanced', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'good', 'stuff', 'Maybe', 'even', 'music-only', 'track', 'show', 'off', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'magnificent', 'score', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'way', 'acknowledge', 'yes', 'ARE', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'actually', 'LIKE', 'better', 'DVD', 'film', 'Meanwhile', ""'m"", 'not', 'holding', 'breath', 'anytime', 'soon', 'now', ""'ll"", 'make', 'do', 'Gold', 'Collection', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'passable', 'transfer', 'while', 'being', 'grateful', 'least', 'bothered', 'present', 'original', 'widescreen', 'format', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'give', 'kudos', 'Disney', 'least', 'fact', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'home', 'video', 'format', 'US']",The Black Cauldron Disney's Masterpiece  VHS
442306,A35GHITTG3WX7E,6304978286,Taran Wanderer,"[6, 8]","Of all of Disney's animated classics, 'The Black Cauldron' was one of the last that I saw, not counting the package features and some of Disney's latest releases which I have no interest in seeing whatsoever.  I didn't have any clue of what The Black Cauldron was about, I had seen a few pictures of it and heard very little about it, at one point, I even thought this film was some kind of Mickey Mouse short.  Well, I finally got to watch ""The Black Cauldron"" and after repeated viewings, I don't know why I waited so long to see it, it is truly amazing and one of Disney's greatest adventure tales.Inspired by the first two titles in The Chronicles of Prydain, 'The Black Cauldron' is the story of assistant pig-keeper Taran, a careless young boy who dreams of one day becoming Prydain's finest warriors.  His chance comes when his master, Dallben discovers that the terrifying Horned King has discovered the powers of one of the pigs the boy takes care of.  You see, Hen Wen the pig can create visions of what's to come and Dallben fears the Horned King will want to use Hen Wen's power for evil.  For this, Dallben sends unprotected Taran alone with Hen Wen and asks him to take care of the pig and hide until its safe.  However, Hen Wen runs away and Taran's adventure begins, meeting such memorable characters as the wild, furry Gurgi, the sweet, sassy Princess Eilonwy and the fun minstrel, Fflewddur Fflam.  Taran and his friends begin a fantastic and magical journey through the lands of Prydain, learning more about the Horned King and his evil intentions, now they must race against him to find the wicked Black Cauldron and destroy it, before the evil King gets his hands on it.This beautiful film offers just about everything that makes a great Disney film, the best of Disney animation and a delightful cast of characters is brought to life with great vocal acting.  Comic relief is brought by such fun characters as Fflewddur Fflam, Gurgi, Creeper and Doli, the grumpy fairy.  The film doesn't have any real songs, but that is made up with a breathtaking soundtrack, very complete and probably knocking out other musicals like even ""The Lion King.""  'The Black Cauldron' is very different from other classic Disney animated features, for one, it doesn't feature a complete happy ending, for Taran never really sees his dream come true, the film ends more realistically having Taran learn that everyone must be happy with whom they are, but you also know that after this adventure, good Taran has gotten yet one big step closer.After reading several reviews, I've seen many people call this the worst of Disney features or a simply forgettable feature.  However, just by comparing it to trashy newer films like ""Home on the Range"" or ""Atlantis - The Lost Empire"" you know ""The Black Cauldron"" is high, high above such films.  'The Black Cauldron' has been poorly released to DVD under the Gold Classic Collection line, which automatically states that the DVD brings little bonus features, which although few, are pretty decent.  What I mind most is such a poor presentation of the film, a restoration such as the ones given to older Disney flicks is definitely needed here, for the film is presented, flashy, shaky and not very sharp.  However, the DVD is still highly recommended and so is the movie.  If you haven't read Lloyd Alexander's books, I recommend watching this before reading the books so you can avoid disappointments, since as others have stated, the film isn't the finest re-telling of the chronicles.",5,'The Black Cauldron' is magical!,1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,3532,"['Disney', 'animated', 'classics', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'saw', 'not', 'counting', 'package', 'features', 'Disney', 'latest', 'releases', 'have', 'interest', 'seeing', 'whatsoever', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'was', 'had', 'seen', 'few', 'pictures', 'heard', 'very', 'little', 'one', 'point', 'even', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'kind', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'short', 'Well', 'finally', 'got', 'watch', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'waited', 'so', 'long', 'see', 'truly', 'amazing', 'one', 'Disney', 'greatest', 'adventure', 'tales.Inspired', 'first', 'two', 'titles', 'Chronicles', 'Prydain', ""'The"", 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'story', 'assistant', 'pig-keeper', 'Taran', 'careless', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'becoming', 'Prydain', 'finest', 'warriors', 'chance', 'when', 'master', 'Dallben', 'terrifying', 'Horned', 'King', 'discovered', 'powers', 'one', 'pigs', 'boy', 'care', 'see', 'Hen', 'Wen', 'pig', 'can', 'create', 'visions', 'what', 'come', 'Dallben', 'Horned', 'King', 'will', 'want', 'use', 'Hen', 'Wen', 'power', 'evil', 'Dallben', 'unprotected', 'Taran', 'alone', 'Hen', 'Wen', 'take', 'care', 'pig', 'hide', 'safe', 'However', 'Hen', 'Wen', 'away', 'Taran', 'adventure', 'meeting', 'such', 'memorable', 'characters', 'wild', 'furry', 'Gurgi', 'sweet', 'sassy', 'Princess', 'Eilonwy', 'fun', 'minstrel', 'Fflewddur', 'Fflam', 'Taran', 'friends', 'begin', 'fantastic', 'magical', 'journey', 'lands', 'Prydain', 'learning', 'more', 'Horned', 'King', 'evil', 'intentions', 'now', 'must', 'race', 'find', 'wicked', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'destroy', 'evil', 'King', 'hands', 'it.This', 'beautiful', 'film', 'offers', 'just', 'everything', 'great', 'Disney', 'film', 'best', 'Disney', 'animation', 'delightful', 'cast', 'characters', 'brought', 'life', 'great', 'vocal', 'acting', 'Comic', 'relief', 'brought', 'such', 'fun', 'characters', 'Fflewddur', 'Fflam', 'Gurgi', 'Creeper', 'Doli', 'grumpy', 'fairy', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'songs', 'made', 'up', 'breathtaking', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'complete', 'probably', 'knocking', 'out', 'other', 'musicals', 'even', 'Lion', 'King', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'very', 'different', 'other', 'classic', 'Disney', 'animated', 'features', 'one', ""n't"", 'feature', 'complete', 'happy', 'ending', 'Taran', 'never', 'really', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'film', 'more', 'realistically', 'having', 'Taran', 'learn', 'everyone', 'must', 'be', 'happy', 'whom', 'are', 'also', 'know', 'adventure', 'good', 'Taran', 'gotten', 'yet', 'one', 'big', 'step', 'closer.After', 'reading', 'several', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'people', 'call', 'worst', 'Disney', 'features', 'simply', 'forgettable', 'feature', 'However', 'just', 'comparing', 'trashy', 'newer', 'films', 'Home', 'Range', 'Atlantis', 'Lost', 'Empire', 'know', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'high', 'high', 'such', 'films', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'been', 'poorly', 'released', 'DVD', 'Gold', 'Classic', 'Collection', 'line', 'automatically', 'DVD', 'little', 'bonus', 'features', 'few', 'are', 'pretty', 'decent', 'What', 'mind', 'most', 'such', 'poor', 'presentation', 'film', 'restoration', 'such', 'ones', 'given', 'older', 'Disney', 'flicks', 'definitely', 'needed', 'here', 'film', 'presented', 'flashy', 'shaky', 'not', 'very', 'sharp', 'However', 'DVD', 'still', 'highly', 'recommended', 'so', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Lloyd', 'Alexander', 'books', 'recommend', 'watching', 'reading', 'books', 'can', 'avoid', 'disappointments', 'others', 'have', 'stated', 'film', ""n't"", 'finest', 're-telling', 'chronicles']",The Black Cauldron Disney's Masterpiece  VHS
