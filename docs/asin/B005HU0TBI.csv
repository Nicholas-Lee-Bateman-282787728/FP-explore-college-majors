Not bad but a lot of the ones that are already out go on sale at Best Buy and Barnes & Noble for around $10. Not to mention they are ALWAYS on cable. It's a lot of money in this economy to spend at once.Secondly, all seasons from 5 onward were filmed in widescreen for HDTVs. Season 14 will NOT be the HDTV airings, but the DVDs that came out at the time, cropped to a 'full screen' ratio, which won't even look right since most people have widescreen TVs now.",3,Great deal as a whole but...,1315958400,"09 14, 2011",2011,568,"['Well', 'right', 'now', 'late', 'September', '2011', 'price', '490', 'Now', 'out', '24.5', 'season', 'Not', 'bad', 'lot', 'ones', 'are', 'already', 'out', 'go', 'sale', 'Best', 'Buy', 'Barnes', 'Noble', '10', 'Not', 'mention', 'are', 'ALWAYS', 'cable', 'lot', 'money', 'economy', 'spend', 'once.Secondly', 'seasons', '5', 'onward', 'were', 'filmed', 'widescreen', 'HDTVs', 'Season', '14', 'will', 'NOT', 'be', 'HDTV', 'airings', 'DVDs', 'came', 'out', 'time', 'cropped', ""'full"", 'screen', 'ratio', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'right', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'widescreen', 'TVs', 'now']",Law & Order: The Complete Series

Wonderful show, actors, writing all of it! Worth owning.

1461252,A2QBP46058NAQO,B005HU0TBI,Bullit9,"[17, 18]","I just recieved my Law & Order mega boxset-what can I say but...WOW!!! Before I discuss the dvd, I'd like to comment on the seller. I bought this item used from Buy_The_Book. The item arrived in 7 days(Great so far!) The item's condition was described by them as brand new with a slight damage (a slim cut) on the barcode. The boxset arrived brand new in it's orginal plastic, in near mint condition, and the damaged barcode was almost unnoticeable. And unless you're planning on reselling this item, a slightly damaged barcode means virtually nothing. And besides, who in their right mind would buy this stunningly beautiful boxset at the prices it's offered at, just to resell it later? And as icing on the seller's cake, they offered it at the almost unheard of price of $350.00 (The same seller is currently offering this boxset in the exact same condition for $472.00-looks like I bought mine just in the nick of time!) And the dvd was sent carefully and meticulously packaged to protect against damage during shipping. Add up all these factors, and this seller could easily sell ice cubes to an eskimo!Now for the dvd-where was I again? Oh yeah-WOW!!!! I've been a huge fan of this tv show almost from the very beginning. It's easily the 2nd best crime/courtroom drama ever made, 2nd only to Perry Mason (The original b/w episodes). What I've always liked so much about Law & Order was it's documentary like feel and the excelent writing and acting. But what I really liked most about the show was that the prosecuters (The Good Guys) DIDN'T ALWAYS WIN!!! This gave the show a true sense of realism that many other popular crime shows (like NCIS) just don't have.I'm so glad Universal decided to release all 20 seasons in one massive beautiful boxset. It's great (and comforting) to know you have every season of your favorite show at your fingertips and available to watch whenever you want, as opposed to collecting a single season every year. I wish Paramount would do the same with Gunsmoke, instead of releasing it in those oh so annoying (and ridiculously high-priced) half season sets.All in all, if you're a fan of Law & Order, then you NEED to get this wonderfully packaged megaset- it's a lovingly mounted tribute to a show that, 50 years from now, will be regarded as much a classic as shows like Perry Mason, The Untouchables, Hawaii 5-O and others.

I've purchased all of the ""L & O"" Season Sets since they began being released in 2002. Up to this point, Seasons 1 theough 8 & Season 14 have been put out. I've read some reviews that were a bit negative regarding this ""Complete Series"" DVD Set, due to the fact that many Seasons would have to be re-purchased. However, for a fan like myself-a fan that would have bought ALL of the Season DVD Sets-buying ""The Complete Series"" 20-Season BoxSet for the reasonable price of $450.00 would SAVE me $. & as an added bonus, all of the 20 Seasons are @ my disposal @ once! No more waiting for Universal to release individual Seasons once or twice/year! Now onto the DVD Set itself....1 of the most beautiful & handsome looking DVD Sets that I've ever seen (& DVD collecting is 1 of my biggest hobbies). Each Season is packaged in a 'tray-stack' 5 or 6 disc set, w/ amazing cover artwork! Also, there is a wonderful 46 page Episode Guide Book, all in full color, & printed on heavy-duty, high-gloss quality paper! It is the perfect guide for the DVD Set. Each Season has 2 pages w/ episode synopsis & great photos from the entire run of the show-giving the owner a guide as to what episodes are on what disc, per Season! The picture & sound quality are amazing, & speaking for the 9 Seasons that have already been released (1 through 8 & 14), the pic/sound quality is even better. Seasons 1 through 4 are Full-Screen, & 5 through 20 are Anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1 Ratio). I conclude by making this point-for those who think that this is too much $ to shell out @ 1 time--if you plan on buying all of the ""L & O"" Seasons eventually, you will save a lot of $ by buying this Set, you won't have to wait to own your favorite newer Seasons, & you'll have a beautiful & exclusive book w/an awesome & beautiful BoxSet that a show like ""L & O"" deserves!

1461263,A35W3JQYP0M655,B005HU0TBI,"John Thomas... ""New England...USA""","[1, 1]","Law And Order will always be to me the perfect example of how to get it all perfect in a cop/courtroom TV drama.  The real difference in this series that continuously set it apart from any other cop drama is very simple.  It totally dispensed with all of the personal drama and romantic bulls**t.  For the most part, the personal lives and loves of all the characters over the years was totally ignored, and never became much of a factor.  Oh throughout the series there was some moments here and there where it broke out of its mold for a while.  Lenny's distant relationship with his daughter, detective Logan's early on unfaithfulness, Van Buren's cancer, etc.  But in all cases they became barely mentioned or emphasized subplots that really did nothing to cease the ever fast moving investigation by the various detectives, and the prosecutors office.  And this is also one of those series that pretty much was left unaffected by the changes over the years with the detectives and lawyers.  We may have had a favorite here and there, (especially Jerry Orbach that lasted almost to the very end and was terrific), but since they never messed with the original formula it never made a whole lot of difference.  It remained right up to the very end the quintessential cop drama.  In fact, the only reason I see that it got canceled after 20 years was not due to its changing or becoming inferior in any way, but just that it unfortunately got lost in the new, (and simply horrible) appetite of reality TV that is like a cancer destroying everything that was once truly funny, or escapist in family entertainment on television.  It just couldn't survive as filet mignon with the overindulgence of meat filler grease burgers that passes for entertainment these days...Though L&O; is easily available in most markets in reruns, this full series is still the way to go.  Not only do most affiliates that carry this buy a specified block of seasons that get repeated over and over, (like Gunsmoke and Bonanza or any other long running classics), but they also have edited, in some cases quite heavily most of the episodes to make room for more commercials.

As a huge L&O fan I had about 9 individual seasons already but managed to resell or swap them and get this giant collection in one package. I thought the total price might drop at some point but I have yet to see this ever listed as a 'Gold Box' deal for say $300--if I did--I'd buy another one to give as a gift. With over 400 episodes the quality of the stories and the acting are really amazing. The sheer volume of entertainment this complete series offers makes it worth every penny in my view. Watching a couple episodes a night, I am still not all the way thru the full 20 seasons!

1461270,ALD1CRUBY1365,B005HU0TBI,R. L. MILLER,"[1, 10]","...""they ain't no sech animule"".One factor of how this series lasted 20 years--it's STORY-BASED rather than CHARACTER-BASED. There was nobody in the first season cast that was still in the cast come the last season. This is the polar opposite of the way ""Two and a Half Men"" had to bring in pinch hitter Ashton Kutcher to replace the spoiled ne'er-do-well Charlie Sheen and all of the fans who admire his ""screw you"" mentality are still screaming bloody murder like Sheen was the persecuted slacker equivalent of Mahatma Ghandi; ""Death to Kutcher--Charlie RULES. Dude, I will NEVER NEVER NEVER watch the series again"".There was never a chance of that in ""Law & Order"" (which my stoner brother calls ""that bleepin' COP show""). ""L&O;"" has always been about the CASES, which Dick Wolf often based on real-life crime. So he cast the series with brilliant character actors who were into acting rather than ego, who had talent rather than cults of personality. Noth, Dzundza, Moriarty down the line to Merkerson, Waterson, Orbach and beyond. A statuesque brunette with a husky voice named Jill Hennessy. A guy named Garrett Wong who was so believable as a forensic psychologist on this series that he bagged a gig as a cop shrink on a more recent series. This series had me pausing at every piano I saw and picking out the first two bars of the theme. I've had that theme as a ringtone on most cell phones I've owned. Somebody would ask me who was in the latest ""L&O;"" that week and I would say ""hell, I don't know, but the story was dynamite"". Because it didn't mean jack squat who starred--the story was the whole ball of wax. Dick Wolf became the Rod Serling of crime stories in creating this series.I should have anticipated that this series would be done on dual-layer discs where there were 5 episodea on a disc rather than 4. I bought a different box set recently which stuck to single-layer and as a result my player won't scan that 5th episode. No problem with that here due to the dual-layer discs used. My thanks to the customer who included a warning in his review about one disc not being included in his set because somebody at the plant goofed and substituted a duplicate of another disc. That fortunately didn't happen to me, but I made sure I went through them all. In this series there are a few crossover episodes where the other half of the story was on ""Homicide: Life On the Street"", and we get that part as well in this set. Unfortunately there was also a crossover with ""Special Victims Unit"" and we don't get the other half of that. Bummer.But whatever you do, DON'T treat yourself to one-day shipping out of eagerness to hold it in your two hands after setting VCRs (and later on DVRs) for it for a whole generation. I tried it just this once and ERRRNGH! Wrong answer. Due to a delay, the package didn't even leave the warehouse until early afternoon on what was supposed to be its ""estimated arrival"" here. I really shouldn't have chosen that shipping rate unless I'd known Amazon had a shipping center somewhere right here in Florida--Georgia at the furthest. I highly recommend the series.
