666802,A26WVK274IA7DN,B00005N5UF,Sarah Bellum,"[1, 1]","This sequel to ""Kids Favorite Songs"" takes an approach in presentation that is different from the first, with Elmo using a video camera to interview children in order to find out what their favorite songs are. This brings an abundance of energy to the project and makes it seem more interactive than a simple, one-sided presentation. The songs are all performed well and the pace is brisk. Most of the songs are standard children's favorites, though ""Elmo's Song"" and ""Rubber Duckie"" are included as well. There is also a cute little side story, which begins with Snuffleupagus singing ""On Top of Old Smoky"" and has him chasing his meatball throughout the program. As with most Sesame Street videos, there is a good mixture of both vintage Sesame Street and new material, with Elmo being joined primarily by Zo and Baby Bear. Fortunately, Zo isn't featured as prominently here as she is in other videos because neither my kids nor I can stand to watch her for prolonged periods. At approximately fifty minutes, this one runs about twenty minutes longer than most other Sesame Street videos. Really my only complaint would be some of the editing, which sometimes disrupts the flow of action; there is a trifle too much back-and-forth. Even with this, my kids (ages one and three) really enjoy this one and one little girl, Wendy, is one of the cutest kids on the planet.  4.5/5 stars",5,Terrific,1194912000,"11 13, 2007",2007,1382,"['sequel', 'Kids', 'Favorite', 'Songs', 'approach', 'presentation', 'different', 'first', 'Elmo', 'using', 'video', 'camera', 'interview', 'children', 'order', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'favorite', 'songs', 'are', 'abundance', 'energy', 'project', 'seem', 'more', 'interactive', 'simple', 'one-sided', 'presentation', 'songs', 'are', 'performed', 'well', 'pace', 'brisk', 'Most', 'songs', 'are', 'standard', 'children', 'favorites', 'Elmo', 'Song', 'Rubber', 'Duckie', 'are', 'included', 'well', 'also', 'cute', 'little', 'side', 'story', 'Snuffleupagus', 'singing', 'Top', 'Old', 'Smoky', 'chasing', 'meatball', 'program', 'most', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'videos', 'good', 'mixture', 'vintage', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'new', 'material', 'Elmo', 'being', 'joined', 'primarily', 'Zo', 'Baby', 'Bear', 'Fortunately', 'Zo', ""n't"", 'featured', 'prominently', 'here', 'other', 'videos', 'kids', 'can', 'stand', 'watch', 'prolonged', 'periods', 'approximately', 'fifty', 'minutes', 'one', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'longer', 'most', 'other', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'videos', 'Really', 'only', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'editing', 'sometimes', 'flow', 'action', 'trifle', 'too', 'much', 'back-and-forth', 'Even', 'kids', 'one', 'three', 'really', 'enjoy', 'one', 'one', 'little', 'girl', 'Wendy', 'one', 'cutest', 'kids', 'planet', '4.5/5', 'stars']",Sesame Street - Kids' Favorite Songs 2 VHS
