Goldberg,"[3, 7]","From the moment that Claudio Abbado crossed the stage of the Philharmonic to take his place on the podium, it seemed that we were in the presence of the walking dead.Much has been made by other reviewers of the conductor's ravaged appearance, the consequence of severe illness prior to this recording, and its positive impact on the performance. I take the opposite view. To me, the eminent maestro's grip on the proceedings was decidedly shaky, and emphasized the magnificent professionalism of the BPO who seemeingly might have carried on equally well without him. Of course, one never knows from a live performance what may have gone on in rehearsals behind the scenes, and perhaps it was in this scenario that Abbado stamped his ideas and personality upon the music, but many of his directorial movements and baton-waving were ugly to behold, and seemed like the death throes of a terminally ill mortal. After the final note, I was convinced that he was about to expire altogether. A Requiem Mass that concludes with an actual death is no everyday occurrence, and the above simulation certainly adds to the drama of the occasion, even though the visual result is far from pretty.All of this is an excuse to say something derogatory to balance the superlatives that one otherwise owes to this astonishing DVD that in many respects is beyond mere perfection. No finer orchestral sound has ever emerged from my speakers. The visual close-ups of the orchestra and their instruments were a feast of the photographers' art. The soloists comprised a strong team that varied from the more than adequate Barcellona and Konstantinov through the exquisite Georghiu, to the gloriously heroic Alagna who turned in the greatest vocal performance I have heard him give in any medium. Since the soloists sing much more frequently in combination rather than individually compard with most oher choral works, it is important to emphasize the wonderfully discrete separation of the voices in the sound recording, and the clarity that results. This effect was enhanced by the fine camera work that singled out the singers to the extent that one could almost read their lips ( George Bush would have been pleased), but it came at a small price: I was initially concerned about the quality of the video that seemed to be cut in sections at times by vertical lines, until I realized that it was merely the leads to the myriad microphones that were being captured by the camera. Some reviewers thought that the close-ups were too intimate. This bothered me only in the case of Konstantinov whose prodigious sweating became evident 5 minutes into the performance and grew steadily more profuse as the music progressed. The prospect of his joining Abbado in an early grave could not be ruled out.Finally, a word of praise for a silent participant: the stunning Philharmonic that is my favourite concert hall and provided such a distinguished background for an equally distinguished performance.",5,The Funeral Director,1289952000,"11 17, 2010",2010,2972,"['moment', 'Claudio', 'Abbado', 'crossed', 'stage', 'Philharmonic', 'take', 'place', 'podium', 'seemed', 'were', 'presence', 'walking', 'dead.Much', 'been', 'made', 'other', 'reviewers', 'conductor', 'ravaged', 'appearance', 'consequence', 'severe', 'illness', 'prior', 'recording', 'positive', 'impact', 'performance', 'take', 'opposite', 'view', 'eminent', 'maestro', 'grip', 'proceedings', 'was', 'decidedly', 'shaky', 'emphasized', 'magnificent', 'professionalism', 'BPO', 'who', 'seemeingly', 'might', 'have', 'carried', 'equally', 'well', 'course', 'one', 'never', 'live', 'performance', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'gone', 'rehearsals', 'scenes', 'perhaps', 'was', 'scenario', 'Abbado', 'stamped', 'ideas', 'personality', 'music', 'many', 'directorial', 'movements', 'baton-waving', 'were', 'ugly', 'behold', 'seemed', 'death', 'throes', 'terminally', 'ill', 'mortal', 'final', 'note', 'was', 'convinced', 'was', 'expire', 'altogether', 'A', 'Requiem', 'Mass', 'actual', 'death', 'everyday', 'occurrence', 'above', 'simulation', 'certainly', 'drama', 'occasion', 'even', 'visual', 'result', 'far', 'pretty.All', 'excuse', 'say', 'something', 'derogatory', 'balance', 'superlatives', 'one', 'otherwise', 'astonishing', 'DVD', 'many', 'respects', 'mere', 'perfection', 'finer', 'orchestral', 'sound', 'ever', 'emerged', 'speakers', 'visual', 'close-ups', 'orchestra', 'instruments', 'were', 'feast', 'photographers', 'art', 'soloists', 'comprised', 'strong', 'team', 'varied', 'more', 'adequate', 'Barcellona', 'Konstantinov', 'exquisite', 'Georghiu', 'gloriously', 'heroic', 'Alagna', 'who', 'turned', 'greatest', 'vocal', 'performance', 'have', 'heard', 'give', 'medium', 'soloists', 'sing', 'much', 'more', 'frequently', 'combination', 'rather', 'individually', 'compard', 'most', 'oher', 'choral', 'works', 'important', 'emphasize', 'wonderfully', 'discrete', 'separation', 'voices', 'sound', 'recording', 'clarity', 'results', 'effect', 'was', 'enhanced', 'fine', 'camera', 'work', 'singled', 'out', 'singers', 'extent', 'one', 'could', 'almost', 'read', 'lips', 'George', 'Bush', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pleased', 'came', 'small', 'price', 'was', 'initially', 'concerned', 'quality', 'video', 'seemed', 'be', 'cut', 'sections', 'times', 'vertical', 'lines', 'realized', 'was', 'merely', 'leads', 'myriad', 'microphones', 'were', 'being', 'captured', 'camera', 'reviewers', 'thought', 'close-ups', 'were', 'too', 'intimate', 'bothered', 'only', 'case', 'Konstantinov', 'prodigious', 'sweating', 'became', 'evident', '5', 'minutes', 'performance', 'grew', 'steadily', 'more', 'profuse', 'music', 'progressed', 'prospect', 'joining', 'Abbado', 'early', 'grave', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'ruled', 'out.Finally', 'word', 'praise', 'silent', 'participant', 'stunning', 'Philharmonic', 'favourite', 'concert', 'hall', 'provided', 'distinguished', 'background', 'equally', 'distinguished', 'performance']","Verdi - Requiem / Angela Gheorghiu, Roberto Alagna, Daniela Barcellona, Julian Konstantinov, Claudio Abbado, Berlin Philharmonic"
701440,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B000066C6K,I. Giles,"[2, 2]","This is a favourite piece for me and over 50 years I have owned many fine recordings on CD of it, all of which have been fine too - and justifiably. However, this one has now topped them all and now I own just the one performance - and this is it.The performance grabs the attention from the very start and is it is apparent that it is immediately capable of being ranked with the best. You could pick and choose various small sections at that exalted level and imagine certain other favourite bits instead but once we get to the Libera Me and the last 20 minutes or so we enter a completely different world of experience - that of the inspirational.Gheorghiu simply brings to her role a level of commitment that is mesmerising and completely at one with both the music and with Abbado's concept. Photographers will tell you that it is always about the eyes - and Georghiu's have it and they never let you go! She brings all her dramatic and communicative operatic skills to bear with extraordinary power and apparent conviction. Every word, every musical phrase is made absolutely special and of extreme importance and relevance.At the end there is prolonged silence as Abbado struggles to regain his composure and not a sound can be heard from a packed hall. Everyone knows that they have just experienced something special and they are right.How lucky for us that this has been caught so very well on camera and as sound. The camera work is typical of this team and is both tasteful and effective The surround sound is all one could wish for, although being greedy, I would add that a Blu-ray version would be the icing on the cake!

I bought it because I love the voices of Angela Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna.  I have several other DVDs featuring these singers.  I was unfamiliar with the other soloists but was very impressed with their excellent voices.  The music is so moving it gives you goosebumps! One tiny criticism is that the dynamic range is so great that if you set the volume high enough to hear the opening pianissimo notes (and in one or two other places) the forte sections turn out to be a bit too loud for comfort.

701443,ARI2C0G2PPBO,B000066C6K,RENS,"[5, 15]","I was very disappointed when I viewed this DVD.  The Berlin Philharmonic plays beautifully, but EMI has such a wide range of sound that very quiet bits (such as the bass drum at ""mors stupebit"") are inaudible and loud passages can simply be too loud.  The Chorus sings excellently, although in a tight-lipped sort of way in matters of enunciation.  So:  three stars for the orchestra and chorus.The soloists are horrendous.  They grimace and pop their eyes and and wring their hands.  If this were a performance of Il Trovatore I'd still say they were hamming it up.  All in all they look grotesque and prove greatly distracting.  The singing is forced (especially bass and tenor) and often louder than Verdi asks for.I'm selling this one off as soon as I can.  In the meantime, I have received the recent DVD release of Leonard Bernstein conducting the Verdi Requiem in St. Paul's Cathedral in London.  The solo singing is superb (check out the four soloists: Arroyo, Veasey, Domingo, and Raimondi!) and the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus cannot be faulted.  Bernstein's conducting style can often seem overly dramatic, but in a space as large as St. Paul's it comes across as necessary and even devout. The DVD is a transfer of a performance filmed in 1970 and released in 1992 on VHS, but the images are clear and the sound is excellent.  And the price is right.It's all a matter of taste, but even admitting that this is so, the highly favorable reviews do not seem to refer to the performace I saw and heard on this DVD.",3,A dissenting opinion and a recommended alternative,1195430400,"11 19, 2007",2007,1531,"['was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'when', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic', 'beautifully', 'EMI', 'wide', 'range', 'sound', 'very', 'quiet', 'bits', 'such', 'bass', 'drum', 'mors', 'stupebit', 'are', 'inaudible', 'loud', 'passages', 'can', 'simply', 'be', 'too', 'loud', 'Chorus', 'sings', 'excellently', 'tight-lipped', 'sort', 'way', 'matters', 'enunciation', 'three', 'stars', 'orchestra', 'chorus.The', 'soloists', 'are', 'horrendous', 'grimace', 'pop', 'eyes', 'wring', 'hands', 'were', 'performance', 'Il', 'Trovatore', ""'d"", 'still', 'say', 'were', 'hamming', 'up', 'look', 'grotesque', 'prove', 'greatly', 'distracting', 'singing', 'forced', 'especially', 'bass', 'tenor', 'often', 'louder', 'Verdi', 'for.I', ""'m"", 'selling', 'one', 'off', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'meantime', 'have', 'received', 'recent', 'DVD', 'release', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein', 'conducting', 'Verdi', 'Requiem', 'St.', 'Paul', 'Cathedral', 'London', 'solo', 'singing', 'superb', 'check', 'out', 'four', 'soloists', 'Arroyo', 'Veasey', 'Domingo', 'Raimondi', 'London', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'Chorus', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'faulted', 'Bernstein', 'conducting', 'style', 'can', 'often', 'seem', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'space', 'as', 'large', 'St.', 'Paul', 'necessary', 'even', 'devout', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'performance', 'filmed', '1970', 'released', '1992', 'VHS', 'images', 'are', 'clear', 'sound', 'excellent', 'price', 'right.It', 'matter', 'taste', 'even', 'admitting', 'so', 'highly', 'favorable', 'reviews', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'refer', 'performace', 'saw', 'heard', 'DVD']","Verdi - Requiem / Angela Gheorghiu, Roberto Alagna, Daniela Barcellona, Julian Konstantinov, Claudio Abbado, Berlin Philharmonic"

The only other DVD of Verdi's Requiem that is competitive with this one is the 1967 Karajan performance on Deutsche Grammophon. Karajan has the better quartet of soloists (Leontyne Price, Fiorenza Cossotto, Luciano Pavarotti, and Nicolai Ghiaurov), but Abbado's singers are more than adequate, and his more recent performance has the advantage of superior recorded sound. Karajan obtains the more beautiful pianissimos, but Abbado generates bigger thrills, especially in the Tuba Mirum where he projects the rolling momentum that Karajan misses.
