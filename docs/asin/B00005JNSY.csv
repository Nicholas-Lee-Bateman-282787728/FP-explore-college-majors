Loretta Swit (of TV's M*A*S*H* fame) is the headliner of this film.  She does a great job as the woman who has to take on the job of directing her church's annual Christmas pageant when another woman has an accident and can't do it.  She bucks up and marches in to take on the task, but she didn't count on the Herdmann children showing up.The Herdmanns were a gaggle of 6 completely unruly unsupervised kids that terrorize their school and town and all the kids in it.  When they volunteer to be the 6 main characters in the pagent none of the other kids dare speak up, so there Loretta Swit is, saddled with the Herdmanns as Joseph, Mary, the three wise men, and the Angel of the Lord, only they don't know ANYTHING about the real Christmas story.Just imagine what you would have thought if you were hearing the Christmas story for the first time!This film is well worth watching. Of course, some of the acting leaves a bit to be desired, but I have to say that my favorite characters are Jackson Davies who plays Loretta Swit's husband and the youngest Hermann, Gladys.The movie has plenty of comedic moments, but more importantly it shows that no matter what a child's background may be, there is an innocence there even though it may be masked by layers of dirt and bruises.A solid 4-star offering!",4,"The greatest christmas movie ever?

I watched it so many times I had every line memorized. I was thrilled to see it on dvd and so I purchased it for Christmas. Well, alot of time has gone by and those old feelings towards this movie didn't quite return. For me, this film is now a piece of nostalgia with some laughs, but not much more. Don't get me wrong, as far as made for tv Christmas flicks, The Best Christmas Pageant Ever is better than most.The storyline is decent. This movie is about a family of impoverished children who are rough, tough and know nothing about the bible. Well, they soon take part in a Christmas play with perfectly well dressed, polite Christian children and adults. This story is made for laughs, and the dialogue is very funny.

It is cute if a bit choppy.  It is very early 80's which is fine and I didn't expect fine art.  The actors are all vaguely OK (L Switt doing just great) but there is a lot of mugging going on.  The Herdman children have dirty faces where the dirt is applied ""just so"" by the makeup crew, which made me smile.  Overall, I totally get what the movie (and I assume the book, although I haven't read it) is going for.  Everyone needs to be accepted, everyone can be touched by the Xmas story, etc..  However, I was deeply disappointed in the church and its members.  At no time did an adult take charge of the situation and really intervene with the situation the Herdman children were in.  The Pastor was shown as only concerned that they were too much trouble.  He seemed unconcerned about their welfare, whether the mother could use some assistance from the Church or whether the children were going hungry.  The lady running the paegent was concerned with the children being there and on time but other than that seemed to show little ocmpassion towards the Herdman children.  A child is caught smoking a cigar in the church and this is mistaken for a real fire to good comic effect.  But the why/how/what and adult would do if a child were smoking cigars in the church was not addressed.  Over and over again adults rolled their eyes at these children and let them run wild even in their own church.  I understand they can't go to their house and parent for this lady necessarily, but you can control things much better that happen on your own turf.  And you can offer a clear caring hand up to these children, that simply was NOT portrayed as happening.  I had a lot of questions about whether the people who attended that church had any care for their community beyond making children do a Paegent once a year.",3,Childhood favorite suffers in modern era,1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,1941,"['wife', 'got', 'movie', 'grew', 'up', 'had', 'fond', 'memories', 'child', 'showed', 'own', 'children', 'cute', 'bit', 'choppy', 'very', 'early', '80', 'fine', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'fine', 'art', 'actors', 'are', 'vaguely', 'OK', 'L', 'Switt', 'doing', 'just', 'great', 'lot', 'mugging', 'going', 'Herdman', 'children', 'have', 'dirty', 'where', 'dirt', 'applied', 'just', 'so', 'makeup', 'crew', 'made', 'smile', 'Overall', 'totally', 'get', 'what', 'movie', 'assume', 'book', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'going', 'Everyone', 'be', 'accepted', 'everyone', 'can', 'be', 'touched', 'Xmas', 'story', 'etc..', 'However', 'was', 'deeply', 'disappointed', 'church', 'members', 'time', 'did', 'adult', 'take', 'charge', 'situation', 'really', 'intervene', 'situation', 'Herdman', 'children', 'were', 'Pastor', 'was', 'shown', 'only', 'concerned', 'were', 'too', 'much', 'trouble', 'seemed', 'unconcerned', 'welfare', 'mother', 'could', 'use', 'assistance', 'Church', 'children', 'were', 'going', 'hungry', 'lady', 'running', 'paegent', 'was', 'concerned', 'children', 'being', 'there', 'time', 'other', 'seemed', 'show', 'little', 'ocmpassion', 'Herdman', 'children', 'child', 'caught', 'smoking', 'cigar', 'church', 'mistaken', 'real', 'fire', 'good', 'comic', 'effect', 'why/how/what', 'adult', 'would', 'do', 'child', 'were', 'smoking', 'cigars', 'church', 'was', 'not', 'addressed', 'over', 'again', 'adults', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'children', 'let', 'run', 'wild', 'even', 'own', 'church', 'understand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'house', 'parent', 'lady', 'necessarily', 'can', 'control', 'things', 'much', 'better', 'happen', 'own', 'turf', 'can', 'offer', 'clear', 'caring', 'hand', 'up', 'children', 'simply', 'was', 'NOT', 'portrayed', 'happening', 'had', 'lot', 'questions', 'people', 'who', 'attended', 'church', 'had', 'care', 'community', 'making', 'children', 'do', 'Paegent', 'once', 'year']",N/A

634823,A2N2S9PPHMW016,B00005JNSY,JDavid,"[4, 5]","This made for TV movie based on the book by Barbara Robinson does not feature the best actors or technical credits.  In fact, some of the actors appear to be amateurs and the film, shot in Canada, was probably done on a barebones budget.  But if you are the kind of viewer that can look beyond these shortcomings and you would enjoy a Christmas themed film with a deeper message than most of the typical irreligious holiday fare, then you may appreciate this movie.  Second, because the story is set in a time significantly different from our own (although not that long ago), it provides some thought-provoking commentary on where we are headed as a society.The story is a cheerful comedy about the annual Christmas program at a typical small town/small-city church.  The most feared family of young troublemakers in the community, the six Herdman siblings, take it into their heads to start attending Sunday School because of the free food.  As a result, they hear about the upcoming Christmas pageant and decide they want all the major roles--Mary, Joseph, the three Wise Men and the lead angel.  The other children are so frightened of them that they don't try for these parts themselves, leaving the lead roles to the Herdmans.  The Herdmans turn out to be completely ignorant of the Biblical account of the birth of Jesus.  Their ignorance of the Bible and their rough ways make everyone in the church fear that the pageant will be a riotous failure. But the Herdmans hear the Christmas story with fresh ears and open hearts, transforming the routine and humdrum Christmas pageant in the process.There is a profound and very old truth at the heart of this story--that it is often the social outcasts and misfits who best appreciate the coming of Jesus that is celebrated at Christmas.  They are the ones who recognize their need for a Savior, as they are not self-satisfied and complacent because of their abilities, achievements, wealth, education and activities.  Everyone except for the Herdmans are too familiar with the Christmas story, to the point that they miss its real meaning.  But because the Herdmans catch a glimpse of the real wonder and power of the birth of Jesus, the Christmas pageant is transformed for the entire church.My daughter was in a children's theater production of this drama.  Many of the children in her play were like the Herdmans in one regard---they were not familiar with the basic Bible stories, including the Nativity.  What has changed since this story was written is that it has become the norm for families to not attend church and to raise their families in complete ignorance of the Bible, whether as a religious text or simply one of the great foundational writings of human history.  This development makes the story dated in that less viewers appreciate, let alone understand, the contrast between the Herdmans and their neighbors.  Skipping the obvious question of what Biblical illiteracy means for our society, I am at least comforted by the record of the Herdmans.  Perhaps more people in our day will hear the Christmas story with honest interest and open ears, considering whether or not the baby Jesus came into this world for their benefit.",5,Special Christmas movie,1233446400,"02 1, 2009",2009,3200,"['made', 'TV', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'Barbara', 'Robinson', 'not', 'feature', 'best', 'actors', 'technical', 'credits', 'fact', 'actors', 'appear', 'be', 'amateurs', 'film', 'shot', 'Canada', 'was', 'probably', 'done', 'barebones', 'budget', 'are', 'kind', 'viewer', 'can', 'look', 'shortcomings', 'would', 'enjoy', 'Christmas', 'themed', 'film', 'deeper', 'message', 'most', 'typical', 'irreligious', 'holiday', 'fare', 'then', 'may', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'Second', 'story', 'set', 'time', 'significantly', 'different', 'own', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'thought-provoking', 'commentary', 'where', 'are', 'headed', 'society.The', 'story', 'cheerful', 'comedy', 'annual', 'Christmas', 'program', 'typical', 'small', 'town/small-city', 'church', 'most', 'feared', 'family', 'young', 'troublemakers', 'community', 'six', 'Herdman', 'siblings', 'take', 'heads', 'start', 'attending', 'Sunday', 'School', 'free', 'food', 'result', 'hear', 'upcoming', 'Christmas', 'pageant', 'decide', 'want', 'major', 'roles', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'three', 'Wise', 'Men', 'lead', 'angel', 'other', 'children', 'are', 'so', 'frightened', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'parts', 'leaving', 'lead', 'Herdmans', 'Herdmans', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'completely', 'ignorant', 'Biblical', 'account', 'birth', 'Jesus', 'ignorance', 'Bible', 'rough', 'ways', 'make', 'everyone', 'church', 'fear', 'pageant', 'will', 'be', 'riotous', 'failure', 'Herdmans', 'hear', 'Christmas', 'story', 'fresh', 'ears', 'open', 'hearts', 'transforming', 'routine', 'humdrum', 'Christmas', 'pageant', 'process.There', 'profound', 'very', 'old', 'truth', 'heart', 'story', 'often', 'social', 'outcasts', 'misfits', 'who', 'best', 'appreciate', 'coming', 'Jesus', 'celebrated', 'Christmas', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'recognize', 'need', 'Savior', 'are', 'not', 'self-satisfied', 'complacent', 'abilities', 'achievements', 'wealth', 'education', 'activities', 'Everyone', 'Herdmans', 'are', 'too', 'familiar', 'Christmas', 'story', 'point', 'miss', 'real', 'meaning', 'Herdmans', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'real', 'wonder', 'power', 'birth', 'Jesus', 'Christmas', 'pageant', 'transformed', 'entire', 'church.My', 'daughter', 'was', 'children', 'theater', 'production', 'drama', 'Many', 'children', 'play', 'were', 'Herdmans', 'one', 'regard', 'were', 'not', 'familiar', 'basic', 'Bible', 'stories', 'including', 'Nativity', 'What', 'changed', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'become', 'norm', 'families', 'not', 'attend', 'church', 'raise', 'families', 'complete', 'ignorance', 'Bible', 'religious', 'text', 'simply', 'one', 'great', 'foundational', 'writings', 'human', 'history', 'development', 'story', 'dated', 'less', 'viewers', 'appreciate', 'let', 'alone', 'understand', 'contrast', 'Herdmans', 'neighbors', 'Skipping', 'obvious', 'question', 'what', 'Biblical', 'illiteracy', 'society', 'am', 'least', 'comforted', 'record', 'Herdmans', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'people', 'day', 'will', 'hear', 'Christmas', 'story', 'honest', 'interest', 'open', 'ears', 'considering', 'not', 'baby', 'Jesus', 'came', 'world', 'benefit']",N/A

The story-line is nice; the only problem-  it's not developed enough.  I would certainly recommend reading the book first- it is BEAUTIFUL!  The characters are described in-depth, whereas the movie just 'skims' the personalities of the actors.  Loretta Switt (of the TV series M*A*S*H*) does a credible job, but I think if the producers would have tried to delve into the characters more, as well as alloted more time for the movie, it very well COULD have become a modern classic.

The DVD arrived in the mail today and as soon as I possibly could, I sat down to watch it...Hmmmm...what can I say? Yes...I know...the movie was made in the 80's, and for television no less. BUT even with that in mind, I was still a little dissappointed with the production.I agree with other reviewers that the acting was for the most part, quite excellent...but first rate performances were not enough to offset the second rate quality of the film itself, which had a faded, almost murky feel so common with television shows in the 80s (as I watched, I swear to you, images of ""Little House on The Prairie"" kept flashing before my eyes)...Would I have purchased the DVD if I had known what I was going to see? The answer is: NO...I wouldn't have. Perhaps it's true that some stories just can't be translated to the screen. Or maybe, more true to the point, it's just that most people do not love this story as much as I do, and therefore are not interested in putting some real money behind it (and give it the production it deserves)...We have a ka-zillion film and stage versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" out there...will someone please make JUST ONE more adaptation of this not-as-popular holiday classic...a film version that I can truly give five stars for...FIVE STARS because to date, it's the only adaptation on Barbara Robinson's book, MINUS TWO STARS because the film production was so unworthy of such a great story...",3,An OK Adaptation of the book,1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,1839,"['was', 'more', 'little', 'surprised', 'when', 'discovered', 'had', 'been', 'film', 'version', 'Barbara', 'Robinson', 'beloved', 'short', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'surprising', 'only', 'attempt', 'bring', 'film', 'was', 'made', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'year.Since', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'book', 'make', 'point', 'read', 'story', 'Christmas', 'put', '20', 'down', 'cyber', 'counter', 'thinking', 'purchased', 'copy', 'DVD', 'arrived', 'mail', 'today', 'as', 'soon', 'possibly', 'could', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'Hmmmm', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'Yes', 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '80', 'television', 'less', 'BUT', 'even', 'mind', 'was', 'still', 'little', 'dissappointed', 'production.I', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'acting', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'quite', 'excellent', 'first', 'rate', 'performances', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'offset', 'second', 'rate', 'quality', 'film', 'had', 'faded', 'almost', 'murky', 'feel', 'so', 'common', 'television', 'shows', '80s', 'watched', 'swear', 'images', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'kept', 'flashing', 'eyes', 'Would', 'have', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'had', 'known', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'answer', 'NO', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'Perhaps', 'true', 'stories', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'translated', 'screen', 'maybe', 'more', 'true', 'point', 'just', 'most', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'love', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'therefore', 'are', 'not', 'interested', 'putting', 'real', 'money', 'give', 'production', 'have', 'ka-zillion', 'film', 'stage', 'versions', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'will', 'someone', 'please', 'make', 'JUST', 'ONE', 'more', 'adaptation', 'not-as-popular', 'holiday', 'classic', 'film', 'version', 'can', 'truly', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'FIVE', 'STARS', 'date', 'only', 'adaptation', 'Barbara', 'Robinson', 'book', 'MINUS', 'TWO', 'STARS', 'film', 'production', 'was', 'so', 'unworthy', 'such', 'great', 'story']",N/A
