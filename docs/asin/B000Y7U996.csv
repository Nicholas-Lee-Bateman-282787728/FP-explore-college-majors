A movie of something that was loved as a teen with a great deal of expectation and anticipation its always a bit scary that its going to be murdered.I was very pleasantly suprised. Especially after having seen the trailer which had worried me even further. I really enjoyed it. I thought all the voice acting was good. They stayed fairly close to the events of the books. Overall it was just a nice experience to see in visual form the stories I'd loved.I do have a few nitpicky things I didn't like. The animation style..not what I would have choosen. I didn't like that they never really overtly refer to Paladine as the platinum dragon. Though at least the constellation was still dragon shaped. Oh and while they were mostly dead on with the presentation of DnD style magic (suprisingly so for a movie thats usually the first thing the producers get wrong.) they didn't get the fireball right.Still, none of that really prevented me from enjoying the movie and being very glad it was made. Would have much rather seen a Peter Jackson style live action but I'm happy to have gotten this.",5,Better than I expected.,1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,1130,"['Whenever', 'something', 'out', 'movie', 'something', 'was', 'loved', 'teen', 'great', 'deal', 'expectation', 'anticipation', 'always', 'bit', 'scary', 'going', 'be', 'murdered.I', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'suprised', 'Especially', 'having', 'seen', 'trailer', 'had', 'worried', 'even', 'further', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'thought', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'stayed', 'fairly', 'close', 'events', 'books', 'Overall', 'was', 'just', 'nice', 'experience', 'see', 'visual', 'form', 'stories', ""'d"", 'loved.I', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'nitpicky', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'animation', 'style..not', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'choosen', 'did', ""n't"", 'never', 'really', 'overtly', 'refer', 'Paladine', 'platinum', 'dragon', 'least', 'constellation', 'was', 'still', 'dragon', 'shaped', 'Oh', 'were', 'mostly', 'dead', 'presentation', 'DnD', 'style', 'magic', 'suprisingly', 'so', 'movie', 'usually', 'first', 'thing', 'producers', 'get', 'wrong', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'fireball', 'right.Still', 'none', 'really', 'prevented', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'being', 'very', 'glad', 'was', 'made', 'Would', 'have', 'much', 'rather', 'seen', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'style', 'live', 'action', ""'m"", 'happy', 'have', 'gotten']",DragonLance Dragons of Autumn Twilight

Colvin ""A.B.C""","[3, 7]","First off, for all those wary people and critics, yes, the animation is less than what we've come to expect in recent times given the advances of CGI and computer animation.  I did think given this story first came in the 80s, the animation fit. However, instead of approaching this film as a flim critic, I allowed the story and characters to move through me.  I was NOT disappointed.Watching the story unfold, one of the first fantasy novels I fell in love with (not to mention Raistlin, voiced perfectly by Keifer Sutherland!!) my heart was giddy in my chest.  I felt like a young girl on a first date.  Yes, I definetly noticed the jumps in storyline, wished the scenes with Onyx and Riverwind being resurrected was included, but I felt the overall story was present.My advice to this, for those who love the books don't approach this film as the book in play-by-play animation.  Instead view it with the same love and excitement as when you read it the first (few!) times and allow the characters to invoke within you all the passion and human emotion delivered.  4 stars and a hopeful prayer for the continuation with a bit more effort on the flow, so that it doesn't leave us hanging.

1116107,A3GL2UVBPDI3W8,B000Y7U996,Adam Lunney,"[1, 1]","In the late 80's and early 90's I found myself reading a great many DragonLance, Forgotten Realm and other books of the fantasy/dungeon and dragons style. All of my friends, who were reading the same books at the time agreed that they would make great movies.Now that we're old enough to have some money to spend (no longer being students or working in supermarkets) a movie has been released. Great potential exists for us to get excited and enthusiastic about it and brainwash children and young relatives about this great new release.But it's not great.Shrek was not a known story before it was released onto the big screen (to the best of my knowledge anyway) and what was produced is undeniably excellent.Unfortunately, an existing fan base, of an age group with money to spend, has been given a poor mix of fuzzy backgrounds over which quite bright and sharp characters move, and now and then they'll interact with totally out of place looking CGI effects. I was expecting something along the animation lines of Shrek or Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within but despite this being the newest of all of those, it has the lowest visual quality.I will say that the voice acting was excellent, and I found that Raistlin was very true to the book (as I remember them anyway). He's as creepy as ever. I am hoping for more, and the ending seems to promise this, but I certainly hope that things get better, even if they have to re-do the first one all over again.The technology exists where this story can be told in the visually exciting way it deserves to be, it should be used!Rent it, and hope for better later on.",2,Lost potential,1214956800,"07 2, 2008",2008,1614,"['late', '80', 'early', '90', 'found', 'reading', 'great', 'many', 'DragonLance', 'Forgotten', 'Realm', 'other', 'books', 'fantasy/dungeon', 'dragons', 'style', 'friends', 'who', 'were', 'reading', 'same', 'books', 'time', 'agreed', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'movies.Now', ""'re"", 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'money', 'spend', 'no', 'longer', 'being', 'students', 'working', 'supermarkets', 'movie', 'been', 'released', 'Great', 'potential', 'exists', 'get', 'excited', 'enthusiastic', 'brainwash', 'children', 'young', 'relatives', 'great', 'new', 'release.But', 'not', 'great.Shrek', 'was', 'not', 'known', 'story', 'was', 'released', 'big', 'screen', 'best', 'knowledge', 'anyway', 'what', 'was', 'produced', 'undeniably', 'excellent.Unfortunately', 'existing', 'fan', 'base', 'age', 'group', 'money', 'spend', 'been', 'given', 'poor', 'mix', 'fuzzy', 'backgrounds', 'quite', 'bright', 'sharp', 'characters', 'move', 'now', 'then', ""'ll"", 'interact', 'totally', 'place', 'looking', 'CGI', 'effects', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'animation', 'lines', 'Shrek', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'being', 'newest', 'lowest', 'visual', 'quality.I', 'will', 'say', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'found', 'Raistlin', 'was', 'very', 'true', 'book', 'remember', 'anyway', 'as', 'creepy', 'ever', 'am', 'hoping', 'more', 'ending', 'promise', 'certainly', 'hope', 'things', 'get', 'better', 'even', 'have', 're-do', 'first', 'one', 'again.The', 'technology', 'where', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'told', 'visually', 'exciting', 'way', 'be', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'Rent', 'hope', 'better', 'later']",DragonLance Dragons of Autumn Twilight
1116108,A32RF0KJA4ZE6E,B000Y7U996,Alanna Evans,"[2, 3]","Like most people that wrote reviews here, I grew up on Dragonlance and over the past twenty years or so, have read the first six books about a dozen times.  I have always wondered why Dragonlance was never adapted for the screen, because it seemed like the perfect kind of heroic/fantasy story that would make a great movie.And it does.The 400 page book has been nicely trimmed into a 90 minute movie.  Most plot points are retained, although I did miss the subplot of ""Tas and the wicker dragon"" which I think would have been hilarious on screen.  But that's a minor gripe.  The characters' personalities are all true to form.  Voice acting sounds great in general and fitting for the characters.The problem with the movie is not the story, nor the voice acting, nor the musical score - which is also pretty moving and nicely orchestrated.  The issue is the animation.The animation is really bad.  The 2d look is acceptable to a certain extent.  It looks very early 80s in the Filmation/He-Man style.  Not fabulous, just look at what animation is doing right now especially in terms of Japanese animation (the beauty and slickness of projects such as Witchblade, Haruhi, etc).  But if they had stuck with that (and only that) I believe the movie would have been better recieved.  Instead, they decided to mix CGI into the 2d realms and it looks TERRIBLE.  Disjointed and just generally poorly animated with jerky/choppy movements and blurry textures.  This is stuff you would expect to see on a very early 90s PC game.  One of the worst parts was the shots of the draconian armies.  It was the same monster cut and pasted a few hundred times looping the same animation.  They didn't even bother to pallete switch a few of them.  For shame!And the video quality is horrible.  This is one of the worst looking DVDs I own, like someone smeared the screen with grease, a blurry mess to put it bluntly.So overall, the movie adapation of the first Dragonlance book DOES capture the mood, setting, story and overall feel of the Dragonlance world in its infancy.  However, the animation is a serious drawback that will keep the movie out of the hands of many people, simply because its laughable.  And that's a shame when everything else seems to go together just right.Except the character designs for the elves.  For a race that's supposed to be mindblowingly beautiful, these guys were just gaunt, pointy, and downright ugly.Terrible character designs people!I hope for a Dragons of Winter Night but with a serious rethinking of the animation strategy.  I know its low budget, but c'mon.  People doing flash animation could have done better.",3,Disappointing BUT worth a watch,1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,2637,"['most', 'people', 'wrote', 'reviews', 'here', 'grew', 'up', 'Dragonlance', 'past', 'twenty', 'years', 'so', 'have', 'read', 'first', 'six', 'books', 'dozen', 'times', 'have', 'always', 'wondered', 'why', 'Dragonlance', 'was', 'never', 'adapted', 'screen', 'seemed', 'perfect', 'kind', 'heroic/fantasy', 'story', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'movie.And', '400', 'page', 'book', 'been', 'nicely', 'trimmed', '90', 'minute', 'movie', 'Most', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'retained', 'did', 'miss', 'subplot', 'Tas', 'wicker', 'dragon', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hilarious', 'screen', 'minor', 'gripe', 'characters', 'personalities', 'are', 'true', 'form', 'Voice', 'acting', 'sounds', 'great', 'general', 'fitting', 'characters.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'not', 'story', 'voice', 'acting', 'musical', 'score', 'also', 'pretty', 'moving', 'nicely', 'orchestrated', 'issue', 'animation.The', 'animation', 'really', 'bad', '2d', 'look', 'acceptable', 'certain', 'extent', 'very', 'early', '80s', 'Filmation/He-Man', 'style', 'Not', 'fabulous', 'just', 'look', 'what', 'animation', 'doing', 'right', 'now', 'especially', 'terms', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'beauty', 'slickness', 'projects', 'such', 'Witchblade', 'Haruhi', 'etc', 'had', 'stuck', 'only', 'believe', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'recieved', 'Instead', 'decided', 'mix', 'CGI', '2d', 'realms', 'TERRIBLE', 'Disjointed', 'just', 'generally', 'poorly', 'animated', 'jerky/choppy', 'movements', 'blurry', 'textures', 'stuff', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'very', 'early', '90s', 'PC', 'game', 'One', 'worst', 'parts', 'was', 'shots', 'draconian', 'armies', 'was', 'same', 'monster', 'cut', 'pasted', 'few', 'hundred', 'times', 'looping', 'same', 'animation', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'pallete', 'switch', 'few', 'shame', 'video', 'quality', 'horrible', 'one', 'worst', 'looking', 'DVDs', 'own', 'someone', 'smeared', 'screen', 'grease', 'blurry', 'mess', 'put', 'bluntly.So', 'overall', 'movie', 'adapation', 'first', 'Dragonlance', 'book', 'DOES', 'capture', 'mood', 'setting', 'story', 'overall', 'feel', 'Dragonlance', 'world', 'infancy', 'However', 'animation', 'serious', 'drawback', 'will', 'keep', 'movie', 'hands', 'many', 'people', 'simply', 'laughable', 'shame', 'when', 'everything', 'else', 'go', 'together', 'just', 'right.Except', 'character', 'designs', 'elves', 'race', 'supposed', 'be', 'mindblowingly', 'beautiful', 'guys', 'were', 'just', 'gaunt', 'pointy', 'downright', 'ugly.Terrible', 'character', 'designs', 'people', 'hope', 'Dragons', 'Winter', 'Night', 'serious', 'rethinking', 'animation', 'strategy', 'know', 'low', 'budget', ""c'mon"", 'People', 'doing', 'flash', 'animation', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better']",DragonLance Dragons of Autumn Twilight

For some bizarre reason they chose to use normal animation, except when it came to dragons and draconians. Then they used a poor-man's computer animation, and plopped them into the regular animated scenes, resulting in wooden-cut-out like appearances, and golem-like movements. The animated movements of the regular characters weren't any better, and everything was poorly drawn. Disney it isn't.It's not very faithful to the source material, for that matter. For those who are familiar with the book, I would just say, don't get your hopes up. No banshee; Riverwind doesn't die; the High Theocrat doesn't stick his hand back into the fire; Tanis doesn't get his sword from the skeleton; they don't follow the white hart; the list goes on, and on, and on.I found myself fast-forwarding alot.

1116112,A1DBQOB2CVLDOS,B000Y7U996,"Chris Van Deelen ""Chris Van Deelen""","[7, 7]","Dragonlance has been around since the 80's. It was the third campaign setting ever published by TSR, which has long since become a subsidiary of Hasbro, the company known as Wizards of the Coast.Back when it first came out, I thought it was a pretty cool world, although back then I was only into the World of Greyhawk.Despite that, I do remember buying the modules and reading them, as well as the very first Dragonlance Trilogy.When you take into account how many novels I've read over the decades that have ensued since, it's no wonder that I barely remember any details about the novels, except that I thought that they were pretty good despite having similarities to other fantasy novels.But, I've said that before in many of my reviews, there is nothing new under the sun, only different ways old stories and characters are presented.So, about a year ago, I heard that Wizards of the Coast had a movie based on Dragons of Autumn in the works. At first, I thought that it was a live action movie, and that some fairly famous actors were involved in it.Keither Sutherland, Lucy Lawless and Michael Rosenbaum all had roles in the movie. It wasn't until only a few months back that I learned that this movie was not live action. Instead it was a combination of computer animation and more traditional cell animation.I figured, hey, cool! Since the first Dungeon and Dragons movie was an atrocity, and the direct to DVD sequel wasn't all that much better, I had high hopes that this movie would do well, because it was done in a less demanding medium.So, when it was released on DVD a few short weeks ago, I went out of my way to try and find it. I should have realized that something was amiss when I only managed to track down one copy of it just last week.I finally had a chance to sit down and watch it with my wife and we were both disappointed in it.For starters, I found that the animation was sub-standard. I've seen better animation on the cartoons that my son typically watches on Teletoon or on Saturday mornings.  What really struck me and made me laugh out loud was that during the very poorly drawn battle scenes, there was next to no blood. Goblins and people were stabbed with swords, but when the weapons were withdrawn, there wasn't any blood on them.And yet some of the female characters `ahem' assets were very well portrayed and even shown to bounce up and down enticingly at least once.Then there was the computer animation. Again, I've seen better animation on weekly shows, such as back in the day, Reboot and Babylon 5. Even Tripping the Rift had better animation.To make matters worse, the traditional animation and the computer animation wasn't meshed cleanly. It was too obvious and very poorly done.This leads me to believe that most of the budget for the movie was probably used to pay to get the better named actors to provide the voices for the characters.Things seemed far too rushed in my view. Characters were introduced, and in at least one case, one was introduced right near the beginning of the movie and promptly never heard of again.I didn't get any feel for these characters at all. Maybe if the movie had been drawn out into a mini series of 6 or more half hour episodes, it would have been better. Even when a prime character seemed on the verge of death, I was like `eh, no big deal, he dies, he dies.'That's not right!I should actually give a damn about the characters, especially since I was already at least somewhat familiar with them (although, two decades since I read the first trilogy, my memory of these characters is at best, vague.)That being said, I would have to guess that this was supposed to be the first in a trilogy of movies, or maybe the lead into a potential TV series. When you consider how cheap the animation is, I'd have to guess that the latter is more likely the case.Now, the question begs to be asked. Would I recommend this movie to anyone?I'm sorry to say, but no. The only way I'd recommend it to anyone is if I knew that they were huge fans of Dragonlance. Even then I'd be hesitant to do so, as they would probably be even more disappointed in the DVD than I was.Finally, the additional features on the DVD were minimal at best.

The plot is rich, the characters are textured, and the imagery is vivid. This cartoon adaptation has nothing of that.Firstly, as others have noted, this is drawn and animated in the style -- and (ahem!) quality -- of a rushed Saturday morning cartoon. You could throw a member of the Scooby Doo or Superfriends casts into the crowds and chances are no one would notice.The character portrayal was equally resplendant. I doubt you could tell High Lord Verminaard from Skeletor or Lex Luthor with your eyes closed. Laurana was reduced to a cartoonish valley girl. Tanis was just Fred from Scooby Doo, but with a beard. And the list of flat stereotypes goes on and on. I need to repeat this: these are NOT the characters you meet in the books! Given the cast of proven actors, I can only blame the director for this amateurish mess.As if a badly drawn and badly acted cartoon weren't enough, the storytelling was just as disastrous. Scenes that inspired fear and awe in the book were bland yawn-jerkers. Scenes that brought a tear to your eye in the book now had all the emotion of a grocery checklist. Long voyages to distant lands were made to feel like a brief stroll around the corner.I had imagined the authors watching this with mouths agape and shaking their heads in disbelief, but to my great shock, I found Tracy Hickman giving this insipid belittling of their magnum opus a glowing review! Maybe it's unrealistic to expect a LoTR-like movie adaptation, but come on! At least hold out for something on the scale of Bakshi instead of something that feels as if it should be interrupted by ads for Sugar Corn Puffs.Conclusion: don't waste good money on this bad CD, but DO read the books.

I did thoroughly enjoy the first trilogy, the first book of this is upon which this movie is based.As such, like most people who have read the book before the movie comes out, I had some disappointment in this film. As a ninety-one minute film, it would have been impossible to include everything from the book faithfully represented here. However, certain things from the book were changed for the film to the point that they were entirely different: the rescue of the children in Pax Tharkas, the final battle with Verminaard and others were changed completely from how they transpired in the book. This was a bit of a problem for me. Other events from the book were left out entirely, likely due to time constraints.The animation was good, in most places and the filmmakers seem to have combined CGI with traditional animation techniques, even including Japanese-style illustrations for the scene showing the pegusus and unicorns.The dialogue did well in its attempt to capture the moods of the main characters. The initial distrust and tension between some of the characters did come through in the film. However, some of the dialogue did reach beyond the limits of drama to become so corny as to be downright intolerable for me to listen and I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the dialogue, especially from Tanis during the battle with Verminaard. More like Saturday morning cartoons than it should have been.If the filmmakers had wanted, they could have made this into a full-length film, rather than the ninety-one minute treatment they gave it. With all the bad three-hour long films that have come out recently, DRAGONLANCE had all the elements needed to create a thoroughly-enjoyable film for all ages, yet was given what seemed to be halfhearted devotion from the filmmakers this time around.What does give me some hope is that a new generation of DRAGONLANCE fans may be created after having seen this movie and becoming interested enough to buy the books for themselves. If/ when that occurs, they will be exposed to the beautiful world of Krynn and all the tragedy, beauty and thrill that it provided to me and to many others.I would not recommend any fans of the book series' to rent or buy this film. However, I would recommend it to anyone who has not read the books, so that they could see for themselves a little of what DRAGONLANCE offered its readers over the years.",3,I Have Mixed Feelings About This,1213488000,"06 15, 2008",2008,2554,"['have', 'read', 'major', 'books', 'original', 'DRAGONLANCE', 'series', 'few', 'sinoffs', 'did', 'lose', 'interest', 'series', 'second', 'trilogy', 'did', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'first', 'trilogy', 'first', 'book', 'upon', 'movie', 'based.As', 'such', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'out', 'had', 'disappointment', 'film', 'ninety-one', 'minute', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'include', 'everything', 'book', 'faithfully', 'represented', 'here', 'However', 'certain', 'things', 'book', 'were', 'changed', 'film', 'point', 'were', 'entirely', 'different', 'rescue', 'children', 'Pax', 'Tharkas', 'final', 'battle', 'Verminaard', 'others', 'were', 'changed', 'completely', 'how', 'transpired', 'book', 'was', 'bit', 'problem', 'Other', 'events', 'book', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'entirely', 'likely', 'due', 'time', 'constraints.The', 'animation', 'was', 'good', 'most', 'places', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'have', 'combined', 'CGI', 'traditional', 'animation', 'techniques', 'even', 'including', 'Japanese-style', 'illustrations', 'scene', 'showing', 'pegusus', 'unicorns.The', 'dialogue', 'did', 'well', 'attempt', 'capture', 'moods', 'main', 'characters', 'initial', 'distrust', 'tension', 'characters', 'did', 'come', 'film', 'However', 'dialogue', 'did', 'reach', 'limits', 'drama', 'become', 'so', 'corny', 'be', 'downright', 'intolerable', 'listen', 'found', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'dialogue', 'especially', 'Tanis', 'battle', 'Verminaard', 'More', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons', 'should', 'have', 'been.If', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'wanted', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'full-length', 'film', 'rather', 'ninety-one', 'minute', 'treatment', 'gave', 'bad', 'three-hour', 'long', 'films', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'recently', 'DRAGONLANCE', 'had', 'elements', 'needed', 'create', 'thoroughly-enjoyable', 'film', 'ages', 'was', 'given', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'halfhearted', 'devotion', 'filmmakers', 'time', 'around.What', 'give', 'hope', 'new', 'generation', 'DRAGONLANCE', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'created', 'having', 'seen', 'movie', 'becoming', 'interested', 'enough', 'buy', 'books', 'If/', 'when', 'will', 'be', 'exposed', 'beautiful', 'world', 'Krynn', 'tragedy', 'beauty', 'thrill', 'provided', 'many', 'others.I', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'fans', 'book', 'series', 'rent', 'buy', 'film', 'However', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'could', 'see', 'little', 'what', 'DRAGONLANCE', 'offered', 'readers', 'years']",DragonLance Dragons of Autumn Twilight

Before you say, ""oh this is a book fan boy review that is pissed about a movie translation"" please keep reading.Putting aside the fact, major points of the book are removed, edited, and such, as with most book to movie translations.  That in reality this should be two movies and not one, just to do the story justice.  This is a review on the actual product that was released.1.  The animation is inconsistent, you will see nicely rendered 3D effects and scenes, and you will see lazy standard animation.  When I say lazy, I am talking poor quality.  And there is clumsy bouncing from scene to scene.2.  For a large number of the 2D animations, to me it seemed like a pane was out of focus.  In my opinion the product never should have been ok'd to release, and the editor should be fired for his or her poor job in quality assurance of the animation process.3.  The story is on fast forward, like I said before, this should have been broken into two movies, 90 minutes does not do the story justice.4.  The voice acting is well done and is a positive aspect of the movie, at first I was not too wild over Kiefer Sutherland's voice of Raistlin, however he did grow on me, and he did a great job.  As well as the other cast members.If you are a fan of the series, rent it before you buy it, and see if this is something you want in your collection.

Needless to say that I was psyched to hear of an animated project based on the books. Unfortunately, this falls prey to the typical ""book/video game to movie"" standard.The animation is about on par with late 80s/early 90s Marvel Saturday morning stuff and at times, the original D&D; cartoon. It does not work well for the story being told, IMO.The movie is PG-13, likely due to some of the violence/blood which is not always at the same level for every fight scene. One fight they show people that were impaled on stakes, people being cooked by fire breathing dragons and blood when creatures are killed. Another fight there's no blood and the creatures are kind of just conked around.Another thing is the too many seconds spent on Tika's bouncy lady lumps. I get that Caremon is checking her out but it just doesn't work, it feels wrong. Maybe I'm too stuck relating the animation to the cartoons of my youth, where this would be way out of place.And then there are the dragons and draconians which are all done in CGI. I don't know if you've ever seen CGI characters and traditionally animated characters intergrated in the same scene successfully, but here they aren't. It looks like a bad special effect from a live action movie. The CGI is of the kind you'd find in a Hot Wheels commercial.The voice acting is not too bad. At first I didn't like Keifer Sutherland as Raistlin, but it grew on me as it went on. He really gets the right attitude down.For 'extras' you get some character designs and a preliminary animation test. Oh, and some trailers!If you're familiar with the story and you like it, I'd say rent it...and even then get it from Redbox for $1.

Dorsett: Technical Rating:  7.4Gut Rating:  9.0I love DragonLance, this picture is not all of the books that I have read but all of the books that I still have. I must say that I kind of like the movie. I will end up owning it because it is one of those types of movies that will grow on you over time. I would recommend renting it first just because there are some problems with the animation and for some of you out there that is a deal breaker in owning a movie. I did find the movie fun to watch they really hit some of the main points that I was looking for in this and that is how are the dragons, Draconians and how did they do with Rastlin all of which they nailed. As far as how it compared to the books... well read the books, also by the way if you are a fan of the book then before you watch this film I should warn you they stick to the main plot and that is it.LikesIt was fun and campy: they did a great job at capturing the table top roleplaying feel epically with the jiggling boobies and focus on Kittera's trunk junk which for you table top players know that has come up during a gamming session.The Voice Talent was very well doneCool Dragons: they looked good and represented well, in other words the red dragons breathed fire and the black dragon spit acid!cool Draconians: they looked nice and when slain they turned to stone trapping some weapons in them when they changedRastlin was well done: his golden hourglass eyes looked cool and they did a nice job portraying him as a haunted person with a dark cloud over him. They did not portray him as an evil character which he is not and I was very pleased to see.Concerns / DislikesAnimation that was 20 years too late: The animation style was western but lacked all of the lesions and techniques learned over the last 20 years. It was jarring and looked terrible.The show felt hollow: They rushed, and missed a lot of notes that exist within the story that would not have taken any time to put into the movie so that I feel that if I had not had all of my previous exposure to the Dragonlance setting I may have had a harder time following the story or found it very one dimensional.The fight scenes looked weak: they were terribly animated and in many instances I found myself thinking 'hey he is off balance wouldn't he just fall over'Lacked good tension and conflict: I got bored at several points throughout the film which is very sad considering how much I love the setting, story, and characters.Many of the characters came across as flat and lacking depth: take for instance Tanis all the film tells you about him is that he is 1/2 Elven and lacks faith, that is it. Many of the characters had that problem that they were just there, once again I was able to just fill in all of the missing information because of my familiarity but a film should not require that background knowledge.This is the animated tale based on the first book in the DragonLance Series, Dragons of Autumn Twilight, by Margaret Weis. The courageous heroes, Tanis, Flint, Tasslehoff, Rastlin, Caramon, and Sturm are meeting in solace as they have pledged years earlier. They are discussing the goblin encounters that they met on their way into Solace when trouble is stirred up. It turns out that the Dark queen Takhisis has risen and with her cleric Verminaard are hunting for the missing staff of light. During the confrontation a man is accidentally knocked into the fire and set alight. That is when we get to meet two new characters the cleric of light Goldmoon and her companion Riverwind. She heals the man with her staff and they all have to flee from the goblins that are attracted to the scene.

1116124,A81OXP3JL0Y5E,B000Y7U996,"Hyper ""Hyper""","[4, 6]","The book Dragons of Autumn Twilight, is an excellent fantasy novel rich in storytelling and character development.  This adaptation is the exact opposite.One of the key element that makes the books so intriguing is the character development.  The books weave an intricate backstory for each character.  You can argue that the characters are caricatures of common fanatsy types, but the books do an excellent job developing these individuals.Not so for this movie... not even close.  Tanis, the reluctant leader of the band is just another member of the group.  Raistlin, the most complex of the group, is reduced to a mere mage.  What could easily fill a 3-hour long movie is instead butchered and crammed into 90 minutes of terribly-paced story-telling.  Key character plot points are also lost:  For those who have read the book, there are just a few key plot points missing:  Bupu makes only a slight appearance, Kitiara is barely mentioned as relevant, the entire backstory of the blue crystal staff bringing hope to Krynn is lost, the Forestmaster isn't mentioned, the complex relationship between Tanis and Raistlin, Tanis and Laurana, Caramon and Raistlin... heck every single complex relationship in the book is trivialized into a 5 second sound bite, if it is even mentioned at all.Additionally, this cartoon looks no better than the average 80s Saturday morning cartoon.  In fact, in many places, the animation was awkward.  With the technology available today, I am amazed that they released a product of such low quality.  They literally should be ashamed.I am a huge fan of Dragonlance, and perhaps my fan-dom makes me more critical of this movie.  After all, I consider Dragonlance part of my youth.  But in all honesty, this movie was simply terrible.  It's a waste of money and time.  Skim the book in 90 minutes instead.

1116127,A28HO8AE8GPUIY,B000Y7U996,J. B. Pritchard,"[6, 6]","Pros:  Some of the characters are decently executed and the movie stays fairly true to the book in terms of script.Cons:  Awful mixture of traditional and CG animation, some awkward dialogue and a general feeling of being rushed and unpolished.This movie does a pretty good job at fitting in most of the stuff that was in the books and it does a pretty good job of portraying certain key characters.  Raistlin, in particular, was well written, well acted, and well drawn which is fortunate as he is such a popular character with fans.  This, however, is all the good that I can say of this movie.To begin with, the sheer look of this movie is enough to cause laughter.  With a few exceptions, the main characters are decently drawn, but for some reason, there is CG animation mixed in this and the two forms do not even remotely go together.  Individually, either form would have been mediocre, but together they just look ridiculous.  I'm no expert on animation and I usually don't nitpick these things, but a child could easily notice that the animation in this film does not mesh.  There are also various decisions which visually do not make sense.  For example, Sturm seems to get a cut on the forehead and the next moment is lying in a huge pool of his own blood, but in the same scene, Tanis is hit many times but shows no sign of injury.  This film really feels like it needed someone to simply go through and point out all the things in it that don't quite logically work or that could be construed as ridiculous.As far as sound goes, the voice acting was usually alright, though not exceptional and the music was completely unremarkable.The script is probably the best thing about this movie as it stays fairly true to the books (other than a Larauna scene at the end which me and my friends laughed at for twenty minutes) and the dialogue between characters is sometimes pretty good, but even it suffers from feeling too rushed.  Instead of cutting out some content and developing characters and relationships more, the each location is given the barest treatment possible.  Also, some characters, especially Tanis, have the habit of stating their innermost conflicts in the most blatant way when these things should be shown more subtlety through dialogue and character emotion.Overall, this movie feels like it could have been good if more time and effort had been put into it.  As it is, I wouldn't recommend it except to the extreme Dragonlance fans and even then I would warn that it contains some big flaws.",2,"Hilarious, but not in a good way",1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,2523,"['Pros', 'characters', 'are', 'decently', 'executed', 'movie', 'fairly', 'true', 'book', 'terms', 'script.Cons', 'Awful', 'mixture', 'traditional', 'CG', 'animation', 'awkward', 'dialogue', 'general', 'feeling', 'being', 'rushed', 'unpolished.This', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'fitting', 'most', 'stuff', 'was', 'books', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'certain', 'key', 'characters', 'Raistlin', 'particular', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'drawn', 'fortunate', 'such', 'popular', 'character', 'fans', 'however', 'good', 'can', 'say', 'movie.To', 'begin', 'sheer', 'look', 'movie', 'enough', 'cause', 'laughter', 'few', 'exceptions', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'decently', 'drawn', 'reason', 'CG', 'animation', 'mixed', 'two', 'forms', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'remotely', 'go', 'together', 'Individually', 'either', 'form', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'mediocre', 'together', 'just', 'look', 'ridiculous', ""'m"", 'expert', 'animation', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'nitpick', 'things', 'child', 'could', 'easily', 'notice', 'animation', 'film', 'not', 'mesh', 'are', 'also', 'various', 'decisions', 'visually', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'example', 'Sturm', 'get', 'cut', 'forehead', 'next', 'moment', 'lying', 'huge', 'pool', 'own', 'blood', 'same', 'scene', 'Tanis', 'hit', 'many', 'times', 'sign', 'injury', 'film', 'really', 'needed', 'someone', 'simply', 'go', 'point', 'out', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'logically', 'work', 'could', 'be', 'construed', 'ridiculous.As', 'far', 'sound', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'usually', 'alright', 'not', 'exceptional', 'music', 'was', 'completely', 'unremarkable.The', 'script', 'probably', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'fairly', 'true', 'books', 'other', 'Larauna', 'scene', 'end', 'friends', 'laughed', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'pretty', 'good', 'even', 'feeling', 'too', 'rushed', 'Instead', 'cutting', 'out', 'content', 'developing', 'characters', 'relationships', 'more', 'location', 'given', 'barest', 'treatment', 'possible', 'Also', 'characters', 'especially', 'Tanis', 'have', 'habit', 'stating', 'innermost', 'conflicts', 'most', 'blatant', 'way', 'when', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'more', 'subtlety', 'dialogue', 'character', 'emotion.Overall', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'more', 'time', 'effort', 'had', 'been', 'put', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'extreme', 'Dragonlance', 'fans', 'even', 'then', 'would', 'warn', 'big', 'flaws']",DragonLance Dragons of Autumn Twilight
1116128,ACEA95FQS1AVP,B000Y7U996,Jem,"[7, 16]","Like many others, I was excited about this film when I heard it was being released.  I thought animation would be a perfect medium to capture the magic.  Since very, very few movies are equal to the source books, I didn't expect it to be perfect.  I did enjoy it, and hope they make a ""Dragons of Winter Night"". However, I have to say I was a little disappointed overall.My major problem was the combination of CGI 3-D animation and traditional 2-D animation.  They did NOT meld well.  The dragons and Draconians looked like they were in the wrong movie!  This was especially jarring since the 2-D animation looked like it came out of the 80's, very old school.  This isn't necessarily bad.  I own a lot of 80's cartoons on DVD.  But the CGI made it look cheesy instead of classic.  I was hoping for clean looking animation like ""Batman: The Animated Series"", or ""Justice League Unlimited"".  I hope the filmakers take this into account and stick with 2-D for a sequel, which I would not hesitate to buy.As to the story, the adaptation was very good.  A full length novel does not compress to an hour and a half movie without feeling rushed, but there was enough backstory for those who never read the series.  The characters were excellent; the production team captured the spirit of each one. And I agree the voice actors were perfectly chosen, especially Keifer Sutherland as Raistlin.

1116129,A1GAC8CMSTGINQ,B000Y7U996,Joe H.,"[7, 8]","Let me first state that I was pretty optimistic when it came to this movie.  I know initially a lot of people were hoping for a live-action theatrical release but I felt a direct to DVD animation film would better capture the niche persona of Dragonlance.  Plus animation gives the creators so much freedom to explore when creating the world of Krynn and its inhabitants.  I really am an animation junkie.  And throw in Kiefer Sutherland as Raistlin?!  Count me in!My expectations began to wane slightly upon the release of the CGi frames.  My first thought was ""These look like screenshots for a Playstation game..."" and I mean Playstation, not Playstation 2 or 3.  I decided I could get passed some less than stellar animation (the 2D stills, while low on detail, were clean looking and attractive enough) and my only fear was that some bad CG stuff would turn away non-fans and thus lessen the possibility of a sequel.Fast forward to yesterday and when I got home from work and popped this sucker in.  Now the menu was really bare, and the extras no where to be found, but I still tried to remain upbeat.  I only care about the film, the rest be damned!  The opening scene caught my eye as we're treated to the aftermath of a most violent confrontation.  The animation was jerky and clumsy, but the still shots at least looked good.  I love the 90's Batman cartoon, and so far it seemed the animation was at least on par with that.Unfortunately it was mostly downhill from there...The soundtrack is a positive.  The only negative I can find with it is that some of the chanting vocals seem out of place at time and there isn't one ""Dragonlance"" main theme with a great hook.  Also it is too loud in some scenes and the characters get drowned out.The voice acting for the main cast is solid.  Flint kind of turned me off at first.  He doesn't really sound like a dwarf, but a guy trying to sound like a dwarf, so that took away from the realism.  And Tas was merely ok.  I commend the effort of Jason Marsden, I just think Tas would sound better with a higher, more youthful voice.  Sutherland did an excellent job with Raistlin.  Some complain he is too dry but that's how I always imagined Raistlin, the man was practically devoid of emotion except for when he goes off on a tangent about his ever growing power.  Goldmoon and Riverwind I felt were excellent.  The rest were good enough.  Some of the support characters sounded out of place.  Onyx and the draconian monk just sound like humans, which makes no sense to me and is really jarring.Unfortunately, that is pretty much where the good ends.  The 2D animation is mediocre at best  It looks fine when standing still, but once the characters start moving it's just clumsy.  I know a lot of money wasn't put towards this thing but maybe if the money wasn't wasted on the pitiful CG more could have been done with the 2D.  The CG dragons remind me of the World of Warcraft commercials that run on tv, only worse. It's really mind-boggling to think that someone, somewhere, thought this stuff looked good.  The film's absolute low point probably occurs with the draconian fight on the right.  There's basically no background, just fog, and watching the 2D characters interact with the 3D draconians is just painful and embarrassing.  I'm really thankful I watched this alone and not with my roommate who has never seen or read anything Dragonlance related as it would immediately put her off.And of course, going in I expected some sacrifices to be made to trim this novel down to 90 minutes, but I didn't realize just how much would be lost.  Losing full scenes is one thing, but losing what makes each character unique is another all together.  I feel like if someone who knows nothing about Dragonlance watches this film they will know just as little afterwards.  We get a hint of Raistlin's hatred for his brother and the affection returned, Riverwind's racism, Sturm's distrust of Raistlin, and so forth but so much is lost.  I felt the biggest victim was Tas, and even more specific, his relationship with Flint.  Tas does not come across as a happy-go-lucky kender with an affinity for thievery.  His thievery is alluded to, but at no point would someone realize that kender have an insatiable desire to collect everything to the point that they can't control themselves.  Nor is it really conveyed how Tas always views himself as innocent.  The scene at the end where he mourns the loss of Fizban has no impact because we never got a sense for what kind of character Tasselhoff really is.  The basic plot of the story is really straight forward fantasy questing type of stuff.  What makes Dragons of Autumn Twilight a great story though are the characters and unfortunately they are completely lost and wasted here.  The other major interaction not given enough attention was the relationship between Raistlin and Bupu.  We can tell Raistlin is different, and perhaps a little cold, but the depth of his selfishness isn't really explored and therefore his attitude towards Bupu doesn't seem at all out place in the film.  The part where she gives him the spellbook, like the scene where Tas cries, has no impact at all where as it is one of my favorite scenes from the trilogy.I could go on and on about other scenes and instances where the essence of a character is lost (Flint's reaction when he thinks Tas is dead in the burning wicker dragon) but I'm sure anyone reading this gets my point.  The plot moves along at a rapid pace as a story really deserving of 2 and a half to 3 hours is shoved into 90 minutes and at no point does the movie fall into a rhythm of any kind.  I've said it before and I'll say it again because it is such an appropriate way to describe the film, but the film really is clumsy in its attempt to tell the story.  I hope that by purchasing the DVD Wizards of the Coast makes enough money to green-light a sequel.  And I hope in turn that the harsh criticism of the fans raises the quality of any sequel so that it is something we can all enjoy and be proud of.  These films do not need to be as good or better than the books, they do not even need to mirror them word for word or scene for scene.  They merely, like the comic books, should provide an alternate way for us to experience Dragonlance that is neither really better or worse, but just unique in the experience offered.  It is my hope that Dragonlance gets another shot on film because as it stands I'd like to forget about this one.I can't, in good conscience, recommend this to anyone but the diehard Dragonlance fan who needs to satisfy his or her curiosity.  For those individuals (myself included) will likely rationalize a purchase as saying ""It can't be that bad, plus I love Dragonlance!"" but trust me, it is.  Most of us will just be left wondering what could have been?",2,Even Tas Wouldn't Want Anything to do With This,1200441600,"01 16, 2008",2008,6836,"['Let', 'first', 'state', 'was', 'pretty',

It's a horrible attempt to milk dragonlance fans out of yet more money.To start off the production value of the movie is something I would equate with highschool art students taking on an animated movie. The animation style is dated, and really poorly drawn and executed. To give an example of how bad this is, they pan and scan certain shots to save on animation costs. Watching a zoom and pan of an animated frame is horrendous.The voice acting is also awful. There's some good names and rarely they show that they do have talent, however for most of the movie as you listen to the voices, you have to wonder if they were only given one shot to do each scene. Most of the voice acting falls very flat and is totally painful to listen to.The other major problem is the CGI work. It's awful. There's no other way to put it. First off it's not at the same frame rate as the regular animation, so the CGI elements look totally out of place. Secondly, they're just not that well done. Most of the CGI monsters look like toys and are very stiffly animated. It's just poor work.If you are a real Dragonlance fan, please don't buy this movie.

This DVD simply fails to live up to an excellent story. Too much plot is jammed into too short a time frame. The tale simply can not be told in an hour and a half. While the movie is faithful to some of the characters (Tanis and Flint), others (namely Sturm and Caramon) are simply ignored. A number of the main themes (such as the tensions between the twins) and plot points (like what happens to Riverwind when Onyx comes out of the well) are also downplayed. Inconsistent animation does not make up for an excellent cast of voices and a solid score. The DVD also lacks any types of features. The movie's PG13 rating seems fair especially with a suprising bit of gore and a small scene with Caramon staring at a nubile Tika which had no point and even less humor. The direction also does not seem to help the film with way too many close ups of faces and it's amazing how many capes and cloaks seem to flow in the breeze at dramatic moments. And why do all the characters speak so fast? A hurried dialogue only make a rushed plot go by even quicker. The movie also annoys by fading to black between scenes. This leaves the impression of a bad made for tv movie which is about the best one can say for this unsatisfying DVD.

The result is a bit of a disappointment; the actors read their lines without any passion whatsoever while at times it seemed that they were reading them for the first time or right after getting out of bed. Kiefer Sutherland, unexpectedly, plays Raistlin (and not one of the warriors as one might expect), but even he (surprisingly) does not do that good of a job. Similarly, Lucy Lawless does not convince in her role as Goldmoon. Another major setback is the poor animation, reminiscent of the Eighties cartoons (the Dungeons and Dragons series included). Moreover, the dialogues are not that hot either.On the positive side, the music is great and the familiar feeling of Krynn and Fantasy is wonderful. Peter Jackson on the one hand and Kiefer Sutherland and Lucy Lawless on the other would have done an amazing job with the trilogy, and with real people as opposed to animation, if only the money was there; maybe sometime in the future then...This product should never have been released with the aim of introducing Dragonlance (and by extension Dungeons and Dragons) to a new audience; rather it should be meant more for the old guard that will want to like it.

1116148,AQZJBVSPWR2LF,B000Y7U996,Ravenova,"[43, 53]","Based on the much acclaimed novel, Dragons of Autumn Twilight by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, the new Dragonlance movie of the same name is both a disappointment and a treasure. The novel Dragons of Autumn Twilight was an instant best seller starting off the Dragonlance series based in the fantastical realm of Krynn with all its dragons, wizards, and light handed kender. As the years have passed, the series has grown and expanded creating a uniquely complex and somewhat logical realm with a solid character base and a penchant for creativity. Along the way, Dragonlance has gained a vast audience of fans varying in ages from young to old. So, of course, it has long been expected that a movie encompassing the delightfully destructive realm of Krynn would be forthcoming. Twenty years later we get a straight to DVD low budget production that, despite the obvious lack of effort, still held a certain magical something that encapsulated the viewers' desperate dreams of dragons.----------------------------------------------The story sticks surprisingly close to the novel it was based upon, including all the major events and not deviating from the original storyline even slightly. It begins with rumors of a wicked army, ruled by the evil goddess Takhisis, amassing in the north, ready to end the 300 years of peace that has reigned over Krynn since the Cataclysm. This army has successfully awakened an ancient evil: dragons. Long thought to be creatures of legend, they have returned to Krynn and in the wake of their fiery breath, millions of innocent citizens are dying. But, the gods of good have not forsaken Krynn and in the wake of evil, they send a crystal staff that holds the key to salvation. As the battle between good and evil rages onward, a cast of unwary heroes joins to fight the darkness of dragons. Among these heroes are Tanis, a dispirited half elf who finds himself not only confused by the battle raging around him, but by the battle inside his heart, a heart wrenching emotional battle between two women that he loves and the inevitable choice he must make that will change everything. Also, not to be missed are the two brothers Majere, Raistlin, a sardonic wizard in training whose limited powers belie his heart of darkness and Caramon, his good natured brother. Along for the journey are two mysterious Plainsmen, Riverwind and his paramour Goldmoon, who possesses the staff gifted to her from the Gods. And, not to be forgotten, the grumpy but lovable old dwarf Flint and his kender sidekick whose good natured curiosity often slides into thievery. And, of course, not to be overlooked is Fizban, the doddery old wizard who just never can recall the correct incantation for that fireball spell. None of the beloved cast of characters, both good and evil, from the novel is left out and the viewer is delighted to finally meet their favorites in ""person.""Unfortunately, the movie follows the novel so closely that it ends with a cliff hanger, as does the novel leaving the viewer somewhat unsatisfied since it is unlikely that a sequel will ever be made. The novel was originally followed by two sequels, Dragons of Winter Night and Dragons of Spring Dawning which concluded the drama and satisfied the reader. Since the movie did not contain the events that transpired in the novels mentioned above, there is no true conclusion but rather an ominous foreshadowing for the future well being of Krynn.The characters, while represented by shoddy animation, were nevertheless presented appropriately, perfectly mirroring the characters in the novel. The voices chosen for each character were perfect, enabling the viewer to immerse themselves into the characters' personas even deeper. The main actors that lent their voice acting to the film are the ever talented Kiefer Sutherland, Lucy Lawless, and Michael Rosenbaum. In this presentation lies the beauty and the satisfaction of the movie. The major events that shocked and delighted the reader were presented magnificently, reminding the viewer vividly of the happy hours spent immersed in the novel. Likewise, the characters we have come to love are brought to a vivid life, drawing the viewer into the world of Krynn once again. Because of this seemingly incidental evocation of a realm we have come to love, the movie succeeds with the viewer despite its flaws.But, what of the cons? Firstly, I must complain loud and long about the presentation of this film. We, the avid fans, have waited years for this moment when Dragonlance finally hit the big screen. So, image the instant irritation when I accidentally discovered this film, floating around aimlessly on Amazon. There was no press, no trailers, no effort. The movie was released without any pomp, going straight to DVD and into the realms of instant anonymity. Once I watched the film, I instantly realized why. Obviously, this film had a budget of approximately fifteen dollars; while the voice over actors who were hired were extremely talented, the animation was pure rubbish. I was not terribly pleased that the creators of the film choose animation. Why not take Dragonlance to the big screen, fill it with real actors and incredible effects such as the much acclaimed Eragon? Why must the film be relegated to the realms of animation? Animation is intended to amuse children, not to present a serious drama. That prejudice aside, the animation itself was the poorest quality that I have ever seen. It was stiff, jerky, and contained minimal details. It appeared more like a slow moving comic strip, with entire frames missing causing the film to be a jerky mess that hesitantly and unexpectedly jumped from frame to frame and scene to scene. Very, very poor Dragonlance. Must do better.And what of the uninitiated viewer who has no pervious knowledge of the Dragonlance saga? If you discover yourself to be one of these individuals, then skip this film. The movie was obviously intended to please the adamant fan's need to collect more overpriced Dragonlance memorabilia. For those who are just looking for a fun fantasy adventure, the Dragonlance movie will prove more of a slapdash effort that follows a set pattern established by a novel that relied heavily on sequels. The ending will prove abrupt to those who are not familiar with the novels ending. If you are searching for a fun, but serious fantasy film then look elsewhere.The special features included on the DVD are, like the entire production, sparse. They include the original test animation and the initial character design and nothing else. Once again, the creators opted for the inexpensive instead of the impressive.To Watch or not to Watch?With all its myriad flaws, the Dragonlance movie still proves an enjoyable sojourn into the wonderful realm of Krynn that will remind adamant Dragonlance fans of the long hours spent bent over the latest novel, dreaming of the characters and trying to out guess the authors' serpentine plot. For this reason, it is definitely worth watching for the already established Dragonlance fan. However, a viewer with no prior knowledge of this realm will be disappointed and instantly disinterested.

I have been a huge fan of the book series since the late 80's.  In fact it is one of the few series that I have to reread every couple of years because they are so enjoyable.  That said, this movie adaptation certainly has its flaws.  The animation is a bit sub-par and why they blended in CGI dragons and draconians I will never understand.  Every scene that combined the two looked odd and took me out of the story.  They should have done it all one way or the other.  I also have to agree with one of the authors, Tracy Hickman, that this was too much story for a 90 minute movie.  Too many good story elements had to be modified or jettisoned all together to fit the running time.  I was SOOO hoping for Tas in the wicker dragon!So what's good about this movie?  Well for one thing, despite the material that was left out, it does get certain beats from the novel right.  I thought Tasslehoff as a character was pretty close to his novel incarnation and provided some well-placed humor.  Raistlin also made the transition from book to film mostly intact.  The final note about this movie that I have to make is to agree with Tracy Hickman in an earlier review that while certainly not perfect, this is a decent first step.  We live in an age where all fantasy films are placed against the model of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Personally I would love to see the Chronicles get the same multi-picture treatment that Rings got, and to do that some smaller steps like this need to take place.  So in light of that I was glad buy this movie just to show support for the story and hope that in the near future it will be done justice.  I hope all the other Dragonlance fans are with me.",3,A decent first step...,1201132800,"01 24, 2008",2008,1817,"['be', 'honest', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'other', 'hand', 'Dragonlance', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'book', 'series', 'late', '80', 'fact', 'one', 'few', 'series', 'have', 'reread', 'couple', 'years', 'are', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'said', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'certainly', 'flaws', 'animation', 'bit', 'sub-par', 'why', 'blended', 'CGI', 'dragons', 'draconians', 'will', 'never', 'understand', 'scene', 'combined', 'two', 'looked', 'odd', 'took', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'also', 'have', 'agree', 'one', 'authors', 'Tracy', 'Hickman', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'story', '90', 'minute', 'movie', 'Too', 'many', 'good', 'story', 'elements', 'had', 'be', 'modified', 'jettisoned', 'together', 'fit', 'running', 'time', 'was', 'SOOO', 'hoping', 'Tas', 'wicker', 'dragon', 'what', 'good', 'movie', 'Well', 'one', 'thing', 'material', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'get', 'certain', 'beats', 'novel', 'right', 'thought', 'Tasslehoff', 'character', 'was', 'pretty', 'close', 'novel', 'incarnation', 'provided', 'well-placed', 'humor', 'Raistlin', 'also', 'made', 'transition', 'book', 'film', 'mostly', 'intact', 'final', 'note', 'movie', 'have', 'make', 'agree', 'Tracy', 'Hickman', 'earlier', 'review', 'certainly', 'not', 'perfect', 'decent', 'first', 'step', 'live', 'age', 'where', 'fantasy', 'films', 'are', 'placed', 'model', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'Personally', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'Chronicles', 'get', 'same', 'multi-picture', 'treatment', 'Rings', 'got', 'do', 'smaller', 'steps', 'need', 'take', 'place', 'So', 'light', 'was', 'glad', 'buy', 'movie', 'just', 'show', 'support', 'story', 'hope', 'near', 'future', 'will', 'be', 'done', 'justice', 'hope', 'other', 'Dragonlance', 'fans', 'are']",DragonLance Dragons of Autumn Twilight

I knew this was coming. And I was pretty sure it was going to be terrible. But I just couldn't stop myself from watching it. I wish I had.If you haven't read the books, the plot concerns a party of adventurers who reunite after five years travelling the world of Krynn looking for a sign that the gods have not forsaken them. Of course, as soon as they get back together (except one, who's mysteriously missing), the sign shows up, and along with it a horde of goblins, as well as the folks who have been controlling the goblins. Adventurers to the rescue! Yeah, it sounds cheesy, and let's face it, most fantasy is, but in the hands of a talented writer-- and Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, who wrote the original Dragonlance trilogy, are very talented writers-- it can tread that line between cheesiness and majesty and come up smelling like roses. In the hands of screenwriter George Strayton, who has worked on such fare as Cleopatra 2525 and Xena: Warrior Princess, it becomes about what we expect, a cheesefest. This is not helped any by the fact that the animation is crude (thus my Saturday morning TV reference above) and looks as if it were drawn mostly by horny thirteen-year-olds who've never had girlfriends. So, then, Saturday morning TV with a distressingly adult bent, though one cast through the lens of a juvenile fantasy life. It made me want to bang my head against the desk until I could no longer see. If you're a fan of the original novels, do yourself a favor and stay far, far away from this mess. If you're not, do yourself a similar favor and just read the novels. *",1,I (literally) wept while watching this.,1227052800,"11 19, 2008",2008,1733,"['Dragons', 'Autumn', 'Twilight', 'Will', 'Meuginot', '2008', 'Will', 'Meuginot', 'done', 'great', 'deal', 'work', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'television', 'knew', 'was', 'coming', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'terrible', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'wish', 'had.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'plot', 'party', 'adventurers', 'who', 'reunite', 'five', 'years', 'travelling', 'world', 'Krynn', 'looking', 'sign', 'gods', 'have', 'not', 'forsaken', 'course', 'as', 'soon', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'one', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'missing', 'sign', 'up', 'horde', 'goblins', 'as', 'well', 'folks', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'controlling', 'goblins', 'Adventurers', 'rescue', 'Yeah', 'cheesy', 'let', 'face', 'most', 'fantasy', 'hands', 'talented', 'writer', 'Margaret', 'Weis', 'Tracy', 'Hickman', 'who', 'wrote', 'original', 'Dragonlance', 'trilogy', 'are', 'very', 'talented', 'writers', 'can', 'tread', 'line', 'cheesiness', 'majesty', 'come', 'up', 'smelling', 'roses', 'hands', 'screenwriter', 'George', 'Strayton', 'who', 'worked', 'such', 'fare', 'Cleopatra', '2525', 'Xena', 'Warrior', 'Princess', 'what', 'expect', 'cheesefest', 'not', 'helped', 'fact', 'animation', 'crude', 'thus', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'TV', 'reference', 'were', 'drawn', 'mostly', 'horny', 'thirteen-year-olds', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'girlfriends', 'So', 'then', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'TV', 'distressingly', 'adult', 'bent', 'one', 'cast', 'lens', 'juvenile', 'fantasy', 'life', 'made', 'want', 'bang', 'head', 'desk', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'see', ""'re"", 'fan', 'original', 'novels', 'do', 'favor', 'stay', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'mess', ""'re"", 'not', 'do', 'similar', 'favor', 'just', 'read', 'novels', '*']",DragonLance Dragons of Autumn Twilight

Raist has always been my favorite character and kinda reminds me of myself at times but then again so does Caramon!  Anyway, I think that this movie was very good for its first go around.  Just remember the Hobbit and you can catch my drift.  The animation wasn't the best and mixing it with CGI rarely works well.  I'm going to take a guess and say that it was funds that made the poor decisions on a lot of the less than stellar mixing of the two.I loved the voice-over by all of the actors.  They made it ""feel"" right and they fit right into the story.  This has been my dream for over 20 years and it finally came true.  Was it a bit disappointing?  Yes.  Could it have been better?  Yes.  Would I buy it?  Yes.  Sometimes even movies that aren't the best are still worth watching and still worth the story.  I know they cut out ALOT of the story and putting the whole book into an hour and a half was a bit much but if you have read the story as many times as I have it still flowed and gave me the pictures and images that I need to walk down the path to Solace with my dear friends and live the adventure as if I were truly there.I would like to say that making these books into a LOTR - type of movie would be totally AWESOME and would rake in hundreds of millions of dollars.  Maybe this will lead to that type of film that will make Margaret and Tracy proud.

1116155,ANEDXRFDZDL18,B000Y7U996,Serene Night,"[18, 21]","Dragons of Autumn Twilight is an animated film based on the bestselling roleplaying fiction epic by Weis and Hickman. The film follows the heroes of the lance from their earliest incarnation as low level characters battling against the oppressive dragon armies of the queen of darkness.Although I hadn't read a Dragonlance novel in years, I picked this film up for old times sake. Let me preface this by saying I didn't expect much from a direct to video release. I found the opening credits pretty cheesy. I did like the character design- the heroes look pretty much the same as they looked on the covers drawn by Elmore with the exception of Laurana (who looks nothing like her original incarnation) and her brother Gilthanas whose features are a bit too lined. I appreciated the level of detail which went into making Sturm look like the stuffy knight he was and to bring out the handsomeness of Caramon and Goldmoon's turquoise earrings. Unfortunately, the low frame rate of the animation, the jerky movement of the characters and yes, the awful CGI rendered the intricacy of the character design a moot point.The plot was fairly involved, and yes there were some adult elements. (Caramon ogles Tika), people die, there is blood, monsters kill humans and each others etc. This is not a film for the small kiddies, although I suspect they would probably enjoy it.There were some animation blunders as well. For instance Laurana is shown in different scenes with and without her armor, the Highlord's mace is shown moving through his own body etc. Overall if they had animated the Draconians and the dragons normally and spent a bit more time upping the frame rate of the animation, I'd probably give it a higher rating. It was still watchable, but the CGI and poor quality animation made it look cheap instead of the cult classic it should've been.3 stars.",3,Flawed incarnation of beloved classic,1201737600,"01 31, 2008",2008,1859,"['Dragons', 'Autumn', 'Twilight', 'animated', 'film', 'based', 'bestselling', 'roleplaying', 'fiction', 'epic', 'Weis', 'Hickman', 'film', 'heroes', 'lance', 'earliest', 'incarnation', 'low', 'level', 'characters', 'battling', 'oppressive', 'dragon', 'armies', 'queen', 'darkness.Although', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'Dragonlance', 'novel', 'years', 'picked', 'film', 'up', 'old', 'times', 'sake', 'Let', 'preface', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'direct', 'video', 'release', 'found', 'opening', 'credits', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'did', 'character', 'design-', 'heroes', 'look', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'looked', 'covers', 'drawn', 'Elmore', 'exception', 'Laurana', 'who', 'nothing', 'original', 'incarnation', 'brother', 'Gilthanas', 'features', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'lined', 'appreciated', 'level', 'detail', 'went', 'making', 'Sturm', 'look', 'stuffy', 'knight', 'was', 'bring', 'out', 'handsomeness', 'Caramon', 'Goldmoon', 'turquoise', 'earrings', 'Unfortunately', 'low', 'frame', 'rate', 'animation', 'jerky', 'movement', 'characters', 'yes', 'awful', 'CGI', 'rendered', 'intricacy', 'character', 'design', 'moot', 'point.The', 'plot', 'was', 'fairly', 'involved', 'yes', 'were', 'adult', 'elements', 'Caramon', 'ogles', 'Tika', 'people', 'die', 'blood', 'monsters', 'kill', 'humans', 'others', 'etc', 'not', 'film', 'small', 'kiddies', 'suspect', 'would', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'were', 'animation', 'blunders', 'as', 'well', 'instance', 'Laurana', 'shown', 'different', 'scenes', 'armor', 'Highlord', 'mace', 'shown', 'moving', 'own', 'body', 'etc', 'had', 'animated', 'Draconians', 'dragons', 'normally', 'spent', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'upping', 'frame', 'rate', 'animation', ""'d"", 'probably', 'give', 'higher', 'rating', 'was', 'still', 'watchable', 'CGI', 'poor', 'quality', 'animation', 'made', 'look', 'cheap', 'instead', 'cult', 'classic', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been.3', 'stars']",DragonLance Dragons of Autumn Twilight

I own every single novel ever released and love them all except for maybe 10 of them. For years I wished that Dragonlance would be turned into a movie, and now that I've gotten my wish, I don't know what to think.When it was announced the movie was being made, I was elated. When I heard it was going to be animated, I wasn't as elated. But then I fugured if they did it right, an animated Dragonlance movie could be as good as a live action movie. I saw some early concept art and was pleasantly surprised at how great it looked, but a few months later I saw the first trailer and was left wondering if it was a joke or not, or at the very least I was hoping the animation I saw was just unfinished. This wasn't the case, unfortunately.The 2d character animation simply sucks. It isn't very detailed at all, it resembles animation from the 80's and it's so jerky that I swear it only runs at 10 or 15 frames per second. The background art and animation tends to be beautiful though. The 3d computer animation ranges anywhere from great to horrid, and all three of these come together to make the movie seem like it's confused. It's really odd, what you see on screen will go from beautiful, to awful, to just okay in the span of a few seconds. Some of the character models are way off too. Flint looks like an albino midget, and Takhisis can only uses one type of breath attack, despite being able to use 5 different ones at once in the novels. At least they put the PG-13 rating to some use and do show a bit of gore and green slime oozing from slain enemies.The voice acting for the most part is excellent. Keifer Sutherland does an excellent job capturing Raistlin's attitude, except the coughing fits he has sound a bit fake. All other characters sound good, except for Tasslehoff. Kenders are supposed to be really care-free, but he is simply childish in the movie. He is animated childish and his voice is childish. I mean, REAL childish.The music in the movie is a mix of orchestral and folk arrangements and is simply awesome. It's one of the better aspects of the movie actually.The story seems to move along at way too fast a pace, but such is the way with novels turned to hour and a half movies. For the time they were given to tell the story, they did a decent job.In the end, I'm glad the movie came out, but I was hoping for so much more. I think most negativity of this movie would have been downgraded had they used a different animation style. Maybe all computer generated, or all hand animated, but in a darker style similar to Don Bluth or something. I know they were only given a million and a half dollar budget when other animated movies get fifty to over a hundred million, but still...I just hope newcomers to Dragonalnce don't think the novels are all childish like this, because they aren't.",3,"Better than I thought it would be, but not all it could have been,",1200441600,"01 16, 2008",2008,2917,"['have', 'beena', 'longime', 'Dragonlance', 'fan', 'not', 'very', 'beginning', 'about', '19', 'years', 'now', 'own', 'single', 'novel', 'ever', 'released', 'love', 'maybe', '10', 'years', 'wished', 'Dragonlance', 'would', 'be', 'turned', 'movie', 'now', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'wish', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think.When', 'was', 'announced', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'was', 'elated', 'When', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'animated', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'elated', 'then', 'fugured', 'did', 'right', 'animated', 'Dragonlance', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'saw', 'early', 'concept', 'art', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'great', 'looked', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'saw', 'first', 'trailer', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'was', 'joke', 'not', 'very', 'least', 'was', 'hoping', 'animation', 'saw', 'was', 'just', 'unfinished', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'unfortunately.The', '2d', 'character', 'animation', 'simply', ""n't"", 'very', 'detailed', 'animation', '80', 'so', 'jerky', 'swear', 'only', '10', '15', 'frames', 'second', 'background', 'art', 'animation', 'tends', 'be', 'beautiful', '3d', 'computer', 'animation', 'anywhere', 'great', 'horrid', 'three', 'come', 'together', 'make', 'movie', 'seem', 'confused', 'really', 'odd', 'what', 'see', 'screen', 'will', 'go', 'beautiful', 'awful', 'just', 'okay', 'span', 'few', 'seconds', 'character', 'models', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'Flint', 'albino', 'midget', 'Takhisis', 'can', 'only', 'uses', 'one', 'type', 'breath', 'attack', 'being', 'able', 'use', '5', 'different', 'ones', 'once', 'novels', 'least', 'put', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'use', 'do', 'show', 'bit', 'gore', 'green', 'slime', 'oozing', 'slain', 'enemies.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'excellent', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'excellent', 'job', 'capturing', 'Raistlin', 'attitude', 'coughing', 'fits', 'sound', 'bit', 'fake', 'other', 'characters', 'sound', 'good', 'Tasslehoff', 'Kenders', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'really', 'care-free', 'simply', 'childish', 'movie', 'animated', 'childish', 'voice', 'childish', 'mean', 'REAL', 'childish.The', 'music', 'movie', 'mix', 'orchestral', 'folk', 'arrangements', 'simply', 'awesome', 'one', 'better', 'aspects', 'movie', 'actually.The', 'story', 'move', 'along', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'pace', 'such', 'way', 'novels', 'turned', 'hour', 'half', 'movies', 'time', 'were', 'given', 'tell', 'story', 'did', 'decent', 'job.In', 'end', ""'m"", 'glad', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'hoping', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'think', 'most', 'negativity', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'downgraded', 'had', 'used', 'different', 'animation', 'style', 'Maybe', 'computer', 'generated', 'hand', 'animated', 'darker', 'style', 'similar', 'Don', 'Bluth', 'something', 'know', 'were', 'only', 'given', 'million', 'half', 'dollar', 'budget', 'when', 'other', 'animated', 'movies', 'get', 'fifty', 'hundred', 'million', 'still', 'just', 'hope', 'newcomers', 'Dragonalnce', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'novels', 'are', 'childish', 'are', ""n't""]",DragonLance Dragons of Autumn Twilight
1116158,A3V79KXIY09MOE,B000Y7U996,"Stacy ""Amazon Junkie""","[5, 5]","Let me first state this. I am a die-hard DragonLance fan. I have so many books we had to devote an entire bookcase. Some of my most prized possessions are two books dedicated to me by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. So needless to say. once I first heard that the long-fabled DragonLance movie was finally being released, I was elated. Yet, this elation was tempered with trepidation.It has long been known that ""the book is better"". While some would disagree, I felt this held true with The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Even, minimally, with Lord of the Rings, as amazing a trilogy as those movies were. So with fear in my heart, I placed my preorder for the movie through Amazon.com, and waited patiently for the package to arrive in my mailbox. Then, the movie sat for nearly a year, before I watched it 4 days ago.Why the delay? I was scared. And, after watching the movie, justifiably so. I was yelling at my television when scenes were altered. The mix of CGI and traditional animation was pulled off horribly. Even with the 'starpower' (and I use the term loosely) of the actors used, the voiceacting was lackluster. So without further ado, the review:The Animation and SoundThe animation for this movie is, in short, average. While not as bad as that atrociously drawn Powerpuff Girls, the detail was not even as good as say, Thundercats (yes, I am showing my age). Most of the artwork stayed true to the books, with most of the characters posing at least a passing resemblance to the novels. Most notably, Raistlin and Tanis were the most accurate. Sturm's armor was a hodgepodge of silver metal; Caramon lacked his trademark Dragon Helm. Goldmoon's leather armor was generic, Flint looked somewhat like the taciturn dwarf, and Tasslehoff was a gaily-colored kender. The colors were bright and vibrant. Backgrounds were boring and lackluster, offering none of the details you would imagine from reading the books.What set the DragonLance novels apart from other book worlds was the amazing detail the authors created. Here, the generic environments that the Companions find themselves in help further drive what could have been a glorious, fitting rendition into the dirt.Even the CGI is lacking. The quality of the cinematics would be more appropriate in 1995, not 2007 (when it was released). No smoothing, jerky animation and the very obvious fact it was CGI detracts from the title. It is really bad when a draconian shows up rendered in full 3-D, attacking a very 2-D Sturm. Gee, having that extra dimension would probably help me win that fight, too.The voiceacting and music could have helped the movie shine. Sadly, even with the voices of actors such as Lucy Lawless and Kiefer Sutherland, the talent is bland and without enthusiasm. The few times the characters are required to speak with any amount of emotion, it seems trite and sarcastic. While it cannot be expected, I suppose, that the actors involved in any movie project like the source material, it is obvious that they probably never read the books. Impromptu, misplaced bravado, random coughing fits for Raistlin, and characters that come across as egotistical idiots further ruins a 25-year-old franchise.The music is nothing to write home about. To be perfectly honest, I can remember little of it. I suppose it could be said it suited the scene, but any movie that has a soundtrack that is immediately wiped from your memory pretty much failed in that department, too.StoryEven with all of the aforementioned, if the movie had stayed true to the stories in the books, I would have been willing to overlook these (major) flaws. I could have ran my books through a shredder, danced on the paper bits and fed them to my dog afterward and done less damage to the story than this movie.Aside from conversations happening that never took place in the books, the concept of ""foreshadowing"" is lost here. Cutscenes interspersed with the storyline pretty much give away the entire plot of the whole trilogy, even though this movie was designed to encompass the first book. While I understand that to execute a verbatim translation from the books onto film would have undoubtedly resulted in a 4-hour movie, critical scenes from the books were missing.With the assumption that you have at least read the novels to have an interest in this movie, here goes some major missing scenes:-The bulk of the Qualinesti interaction after the slave caravan is rescued-The Sla-Mori sequence is horribly abbreviated, including the Dark Elf gone-Rescuing the slaves at Pax Tharkas is shorted, with Eben never really being explained as a traitor-The wicker dragon in the swamp, from the first part of the book, was missing entirely; the party literally went from Que Shu to Xak Tsaroth in one swift scene- I guess it was next doorThis does not encompass every missing scene. Other major faux pas include revealing the true identity of Fizban right after the release of the slaves from Pax Tharkas, as well as having his death occur from falling into a chasm, rather than down the chain mechanism within the fortress. At the beginning, when the old man hobbles into the Inn of the Last Home, Tika asks him to tell her a story to help pass the time, which also never happened in the books. I suppose you could consider this a minor complaint, however, as a purist, this helps to foster the handholding this movie has. Come to think of it, there were no parts of the movie that weren't awkwardly and painfully explained later.The VerdictFor the sake of completing your DragonLance collection, that is really the only reason I can think of to shell out your hard-earned cash on this cannonfodder. If you have only a passing interest in the series, are thinking about reading the books and find this to be a quick way out, or are a glutton for punishment and want to see a series with a rabid following destroyed for an hour (or so), pick this up. It is with a heavy heart that I say do not waste your money on this pile of... garbage. Pure and simple.",2,*sobs of anger* This movie sucks!,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,6010,"['Let', 'first', 'state', 'am', 'die-hard', 'DragonLance', 'fan', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'books', 'had',

1116161,A2QR035HCPBSLC,B000Y7U996,"The B ""ahnonamis""","[4, 5]","If you grew up reading fantasy novels, chances are you're familiar with Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis' Dragonlance series. The books are a staple in fantasy fiction, and contain some of the genres most beloved and renowned characters. The story revolves around the land of Krynn, which was abandoned by the light gods more than 300 years ago. Unfortunately for its friendly inhabitants, the dark gods have made a comeback. Cue the group of random heroes who traverse the land and fight all sorts of monsters in order to save the world.When I heard that we were being treated to an animated Dragonlance feature, I was very, very excited; finally, I thought, Dragonlance would get a chance to shine in the mainstream. With a cast including Keifer Sutherland, Phil LaMarr, Lucy Lawless, Michelle Trachtenberg and others, it was sure to be a hit! How nave I was.Despite having an excellent source material, Dragonlance: Dragons of the Autumn Twilight falls short in just about every department you can imagine. Even the very beginning of the feature will leave you shaking your head, as you bear witness to what looks like Beast Wars animation in the Dragonlance logo. (Which, by the way, goes on way too long for what it is.)The animation woes aren't specific to the title screen, either. In what was a very stupid move, the film contains both 3D and 2D animation. The problem? Like I said, the 3D animation looks like early 90s CG, and the 2D animation belongs in an 80's Saturday morning cartoon, not a feature film in 2008.If you're a Dragonlance fan, I bet right now you're reading this with a single tear running down your cheek, asking ""Surely the content can make up for those shortcomings!"" I'm sorry to say they don't.What begins as issues with the presentation and techincal aspects of the movie ends with issues in every other area. For starters, this is a PG-13 movie for violence, yet there's very little violence, and what we do see is extremely poorly done. Since it's all hand-drawn (which, I admit, was a nice attempt at being unique), moments with a lot of action actually stutter and lag visually for a bit. Imagine loading into an area in World of Warcraft with a lot of people just hanging out, and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.Now, when I talk about the lack of violence, I'm not complaining because the movie isn't violent enough. Rather, the movie TRIES to be violent but just decides halfway through, ""You know what? Screw it. We're a cartoon!"" I'm talking full blown dwarven axe to the chest as an instant kill - yet not a single drop of blood. Or a person dramatically cutting away at a fallen opponent who's offscreen, yet when we pan out they're completely intact, and look like they're napping due to the jarred storyline instead of being slaughtered by an angry half-elf. That all changes when 3D baddies are involved, though. Stick them with something sharp, and they'll bleed a little until the wound vanishes in the next screen and their armor isn't even damaged.When it comes right down to it, Dragonlance: Dragons of the Autumn Twilight relied too much on the original material. If you aren't familiar with the book, you aren't going to know what the hell is going on. Even Hickman has said in the past that the first book should be split into two movies; guess the makers of this one didn't listen.If only the producers spent less budget on Hollywood voice talent which was largely miscast, and put more money towards the actual animation and editing, then maybe we'd have a serviceable film for Dragonlance fans, much like DC and Marvel's animated DVD features do their thing for comic fans. As it is, this is an affront to anyone who has ever loved the books, and I sure hope someone else gets a shot at the next Dragonlance film.How you'll feel after this is all overCONTENT - 1/5Oh God, where to start. There's far too much material to cram into this short of a time slot, and what is crammed in doesn't flow well at all. People unfamiliar with the books will have no idea what the hell is going on, and people who loved the books will be pissed that the only character with any sort of build-up is Tanis.VIDEO - 2/5From a technical standpoint, I suppose there's nothing wrong with the output. From a stylistic one, though, it's a mess. Crappy 3D with dated 2D? Yeah, it would work assuming the 3D monsters weren't fighting the 2D heroes in half the scenes.AUDIO - 3.5/5There's 5.1 and 2 channel sound available, so if you have a system you can get something out of it. At times the music seems a little too loud, and turning it up to hear the talking will annoy your neighbors. Despite the list of big names, no one really stands out. (Except Phil LaMarr, but that's just because he uses the EXACT same voice as he did for Green Lantern. Close your eyes, and you'll hear John, not Riverwind.)EXTRAS - 0.5/5The two extras on the disc are basically Powerpoint presentations of preliminary artwork. Sadly, the line-art preview looks better than the final product.REPLAY - 1/5Unless you're the type who loves to get drunk with friends and laugh at old 80's cartoons, once you finish this you'll likely put it away for good.OVERALL SCORE - 1/5If you're a huge fan of the Dragonlance series and pick this up, be forewarned that you will eventually regret it. Sure, at first it seems okay, then at the end it seems like it picks up, but when it's all said and done, this straight-to-DVD animated feature falls short in every area. I sure hope Weis and Hickman didn't have to clear this before it went to print...",1,A slap in the face of Weis and Hickman,1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,5560,"['grew', 'up', 'reading', 'fantasy',

If you have ever read the original Dragonlance novels please save yourself the distress that comes with viewing this movie, unless your masochistic....then rent it.1) The animation is awful. It is reminiscent of bad 80's animation fused with horrible CG work and is also jerky looking. However, I could have forgiven the animation if the story line had been decent.2) They took a movie that probably could have been adequately done in 3 hours and shoved it into 90 minutes. The movie starts off following the original story line, then in an attempt to make it fit into 90 minutes veers completely off course. There was very little character development, virtually no background info regarding the characters was shown and important points in the plot (that would have been relevant to a sequel) were totally omitted. It's like they put in the first few chapters of the book then just jump to the last chapter in an effort to end it in time.3) Pet peeve: What's up with the Forest Master being covered in vines??? Seriously! Was she attacked by Swampthing or something?!?!?I could probably continue to rant about the other offenses this movie has to offer such as: the terrible voice acting, inconsistencies and mediocre script. However, I believe I have covered the important points.If you love the original Dragonlance Chronicles at all you should probably steer clear of this. If you've never read them...you should probably still steer clear of this movie....",1,Absolutely wretched!

1116163,A247SEXW47UU1P,B000Y7U996,Troy Gordon,"[0, 1]","These books taught me to enjoy reading when I was 12 or 13.  Until that point, reading was something that was required by school.  I love the Chronicles series and highly recommend them to anybody, but especially those young teen types who may be emboldened by World of Warcraft or other fantasy series.  The books are pretty typical and owe a great deal of their story to (in my opinion) the Star Wars Series and The Lord of the Rings.  The ups and downs and as George Lucas would describe it, the classic story telling technique of a possible stand alone story (the first in all 3 mentioned seriesP), a deeper/darker second part, and a conclusion in part 3.  This stand alone was a good thing to make into an animated film in my opinion, but they could have done a lot more with it.It is pretty true to the story in the book, and even provides some background information not mentioned in the original text.  I don't think this takes away from the movie, nor does its absence hurt the book, but it may have drawn away some of the portions of the book which I had grown quite fond of.  Most of Xak Tsaroth and the black dragon was skipped over or substantially abbreviated, and I really enjoyed reading those portions.  Also removed was the Tas in the False Black Dragon, another favorite of mine that I felt helped keep the characters and story in line.  It goes fine in the movie, but it was disappointing.The music is actually pretty impressive.  Very Fellowship of the Rings and I am sure it is deliberately so.  It won't hold up to the Fellowship soundtrack to save its life, but its not bad.The animation is a weird ""We wish we could draw like JAPANAME"" type seen in a lot of recent cartoons, and that is also disappointing.  Very Saturday morning cartoon/ old GI Joe, and that isn't the right answer.  Its not even The Hobbit good, which it might have learned more than a few things from and kept some of the old school flavor to make it seem a bit more nostalgic.  Some scenes are very well done however and the effort is apparent, but some look like they were not finished in time and just look absolutely terrible!  See the exit from Xak Tsaroth to see what I'm talking about.  The artists also took some liberties in their creation, which I am not a fan of.  Qualinesti got turned into some weird David the Gnome/Lothl&oacute;rien hybrid, which is not how I perceived it in the least.  The characters are pretty well done, though Goldmoon is a blonde/blue, which doesn't make much sense for a Native American based culture.  Some complain about the Draconians and the CG animation technique used for them, but it really isn't all that bad.  The dragons are also CG.  Overall, once you can get past the choppy Saturday morning nature, you can power through.  For a book like this that means so much to so many people though, they really should have tried for crisper animation and continuity.  Do we expect Cowboy Bebop like art or Ghost in the Shell/SAC like precision?  Probably not, but we would at least like to see them try instead of settling for mediocrity.  The boobage is also a bit ridiculous.  Granted, the target audience is young teen males probably, but the reviewer who said it just felt weird to be watching Caramon check out Tika's obviously bouncing and gravity defying gigantic breasts hit the nail on the head.  They should have toned that back a bit and kept it sane.  There is a love story there between many characters, even sex in the novels, and Tika's rack is mentioned several times, but there are better ways to visualize it for your audience to show the connection and still hold a little bit of class besides the obvious focus on breasts in several scenes.  It can be quite obvious.  There is one scene where the camera actually starts out looking at cleavage before panning to the speakers face. If they make a second, I hope they leave the Kit promiscuity up to our imagination and we aren't faced with some awkward Team America sex scene.Voice Acting-  Terrible.  There's really no other way to say it.  Sutherland may have been persuaded by cash or something just so they would have a name to put on the DVD case, but it sounds like he is saying his lines as lifeless and as quickly as possible to make it out of the studio and back to being Jack Bauer as fast as possible.  I always thought Gary Sinise would have been a shoe in for the role, live or animated, but again, just my opinion.  The hissing draconinan monks we probably all loved sounded like the weatherman from Peoria Illinois, crisp and clear, which really doesn't paint the character at all.So overall, it isn't bad, but it isn't good.  It could have been so much more but just feels rushed and willing to accept good enough.  I would say it is worth seeing for any fan of the series, but it is in no way shape or form an adequate substitute for the book.  I wouldn't watch it prior to reading the books either, because the imagery provided in the books is much much stronger (what a pathetic thing to say about a movie really...) and your own imagination will be more than adequate when guided by the authors.",3,"Not great, but not bad.
