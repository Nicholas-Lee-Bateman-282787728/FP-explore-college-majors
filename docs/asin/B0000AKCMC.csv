764056,AYJ6P9F8GX9XF,B0000AKCMC,Cecily Champagne,"[5, 5]","Cinemania is a fascinating and very funny documentary that focuses on the lives of five New York film-lovers.  The men (and woman) this film chronicles are not simply erudite, artsy types who can appreciate Bergman.  They are people who have literally re-arranged their lives in order to make movie-watching their primary focus.  They are all articulate and funny.  None of them are normal ... they range from strangely overzealous to OCD to downright creepy.  And - while it is frequently hilarious to listen to their testimonies (one cinephile suggested that he's ripped food out of a too-noisy movie-goers hands; another has memorized the precise running time for practically every movie he's ever seen; and another is permanently banned from the MOMA (I'll let you figure out why)), it is also a little sad that these people get more fulfillment from movies than they do from their everyday lives.This documentary excels most when it asks *why* these people need to watch movies (the answers, I think, also speak to the pleasure each of us gets from escapism).  There is a scene where Jack, the main ""character"" in the film, insists that he could only make love to Rita Hayworth in black-in-white.  It's an interesting and telling concept.  Cinemania's greatest weakness is probably its amateurish production qualities.  Rather than come across as quirky and immediate, they are more along the lines of frustrating.  But this is only a minor complaint.  Overall, I would still recommend Cinemania.  I can pretty much guarantee that, if you give it a shot, you'll be entertained and amazed.",4,fascinating,1147132800,"05 9, 2006",2006,1593,"['Cinemania', 'fascinating', 'very', 'funny', 'documentary', 'lives', 'five', 'New', 'York', 'film-lovers', 'men', 'woman', 'film', 'chronicles', 'are', 'not', 'simply', 'erudite', 'artsy', 'types', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'Bergman', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'literally', 're-arranged', 'lives', 'order', 'make', 'movie-watching', 'primary', 'focus', 'are', 'articulate', 'funny', 'None', 'are', 'normal', 'range', 'strangely', 'overzealous', 'OCD', 'downright', 'creepy', 'frequently', 'hilarious', 'listen', 'testimonies', 'one', 'cinephile', 'suggested', 'ripped', 'food', 'too-noisy', 'movie-goers', 'hands', 'memorized', 'precise', 'running', 'time', 'practically', 'movie', 'ever', 'seen', 'permanently', 'banned', 'MOMA', ""'ll"", 'let', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'also', 'little', 'sad', 'people', 'get', 'more', 'fulfillment', 'movies', 'do', 'everyday', 'lives.This', 'documentary', 'excels', 'most', 'when', '*why*', 'people', 'need', 'watch', 'movies', 'answers', 'think', 'also', 'speak', 'pleasure', 'escapism', 'scene', 'where', 'Jack', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'could', 'only', 'make', 'love', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'black-in-white', 'interesting', 'telling', 'concept', 'Cinemania', 'greatest', 'weakness', 'probably', 'amateurish', 'production', 'qualities', 'Rather', 'come', 'quirky', 'immediate', 'are', 'more', 'lines', 'frustrating', 'only', 'minor', 'complaint', 'Overall', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'Cinemania', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guarantee', 'give', 'shot', ""'ll"", 'be', 'entertained', 'amazed']",Cinemania

It's absolutely surreal and hilarious although parts of it is rather sad and even a little disturbing. The movie could've used better planning though.

One has a history of being violent and attacking people - usually theater workers.

764061,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0000AKCMC,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[2, 4]","In the protection of the theater darkness the cinephiles withdraw from society in an attempt to seek something better and more fulfilling.  Background sound from a reel spins while 24 frames per second is pulled through a ray of light that projects a visual experience which could offer an escape, possible enlightenment, emotional experience, and more.  The light displays people such as Julie Andrews, Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn and others as they move through tragedy, comedy, danger, and love among many adventures, which sometimes are true and sometimes complete fiction.  This story, however, is completely true as the characters of the documentary, Cinemania, present the world in which they feel most at home.Film has an alluring inspiration as it mesmerizes the audience through light and sound at a safe distance.  A viewer that sits down in front of a screen can, in peace, experience happiness, love, heartache, danger, and fear while knowing what is on the screen cannot physically hurt them.  The film provides a two sensory experience (visual and auditory) that can enlighten the viewer in such a manner that the viewer can learn something from the cinematic experience.  Thus, at the end of the film there should be a slight change within the viewer as the film offers something to reflect upon, or an experience that affects the audience.  Escapism could be defined as habitually removing one's self from reality into a safe environment where mere visual invention creates an opportunity for cerebral activity and entertainment.  The characters in Cinemania seem to do this several times on a daily basis as they base their life on this visual and auditory escape.The documentary follows Roberta, Jack, Eric, Bill, and Harvey and how they live their lives and how film affects their life as a whole.  Through their escapism, which is even discussed in the film, the film depicts how they plan when to see a film, how they find out where they show the best print of the film, and the fastest route to the theater where the film is to be shown in order to maximize the number of viewings.  If they would miss a film, it would be a disaster, as if they missed an opportunity to find essential wisdom, or a life experience such as a first love.  However, they miss birthday parties, weddings, and funerals with no hesitation as film is their life.  They do not hold jobs as they live month to month on disability and welfare money with a constant threat of being evicted.  A psychologist would deem them to have a severe addiction as it negatively affects their social, financial, and physical health to what would be considered the norm.  Nonetheless, they are aware of their habits as they love the moment when the theater gradually darkens and the projector display its magic on the screen.The magic of film and cinema is an illusion that affects all viewers in one way or another, but for Roberta, Jack, Eric, Bill, and Harvey it is as important as breathing.  Cinema has hexed them into a state where they must participate as frequently as possible while the hectic life of New York surrounds them.  A good thing is that they live in New York as it is the only city that could be compared to the cinematic Mecca, Paris.  This means that they get to see several advance screenings.Cinemania is a film that most viewers would find interesting, intriguing, amusing, and much more as it conveys the story of five eccentric New Yorkers and their cinematic obsessions.  Many film enthusiasts could find a resemblance to themselves in the film, yet most do not want to recognize their own peculiarities through this documentary.

Still, this is an interesting portrait of five of New York's most relentless, hardcore cinephiles, circa 2001 - people who make me and most of my Chicago cinephile friends from the 1990s look like pikers. The title ""cinemania"" is very apropos, as both the filmmakers and the filmed-buffs often see their cinema love and lonely, obsessive lifestyles as a disease or addiction more than as a passion. But a couple of them are quite articulate and do make attempts to explain it as a valid way of life outside of society's norms, and even if they're not perfectly happy we get the idea that this isn't as bad a choice as others they might have made.This certainly could have been longer, and had a wider scope to encompass some of the less desperate examples of the bree, like I and some of my friends used to be - ok, we were in Chicago, but there were New Yorkers much like us who saw hundreds of films in the cinema every year but still had decent jobs, friends, even significant others.  One gets the impression that most of the cinemaniacs have embraced their hobby as much out of desperation and the lack of anything else useful or important to do with their time.

They don't have jobs (one does) and live frugally with the exception of this obsession with films. All live in small apartments (maybe rented rooms) crammed with books, movies and movie paraphernalia. You also see plastic bags and junk laying around. So this tells me they have mental illness of some sort.I am an introvert like them. I'm also messy so I don't like having too much stuff. That way my home isn't cluttered with belongings never being used. So perhaps under the right circumstances I would be like them.
