Interesting cases, pioneering special effects that suddenly took you INSIDE a murder victim's body to examine the injuries, competent acting... these all made CSI the pop-culture phenomenon it is today.What sets this first season apart was that aside from the weekly crimes, the show actually dealt with the personal lives of the characters, and most episodes had continuing plotlines which were separate from the ""crimes-of-the-night"": Catherine had her child custody issues with her ex, Nick had his complicated relationship with a hooker, Sara had to deal with being the new person on the team, Warrick had his gambling problem/corrupt judge subplot, and Grissom had his romance with ""face lady"", his rivalry with the daytime CSI team's chief, and his professional problems with the sheriff and the mayor.Such subplots vanished in season two - Catherine suddenly appeared as if she had no family, Grissom became a complete eunuch, as did Nick, who never had another girlfriend. But the ratings improved, so I guess that's what people prefer - a more classic, completely episodic crime series without the continuing subplots that give it a soap-like quality.But for me, I miss those subplots, which is why I think this first season of CSI is a must-have on DVD.

CSI happened to be a show that a friend of mine always Tivo'd and talked about constantly. I really like watching forensics, love a good mystery, and heard rave reviews from magazines so I put it in the back of my mind to catch at least on CSI show. While I was in Blockbuster I rented the first disc of the first season and was hooked. In two week I have watched the whole first season on dvd.I really like this show because of the array of forensics used from body decay analysis, insect time lines, ballistics, putting faces on found bones, and DNA testing with everything from saliva on straw, epithelial cells on curtain tie back, to cat blood and nasal mucous found on a car window. I like how there are constant re-enactments once someone comes up with a theory or when you can tell a piece of evidence has clicked in the minds of a CSI.I also like the cast who do a fine job in portraying people from mixed backgrounds with different agendas to becoming CSIs and who have specialties that make the difference in cases. I appreciate how real the characters are as well. They are tough as nails, not always right, and always seem to go the extra mile from staying with victims, sacrificing personal lives, and never giving up. It may be overly dramatic at times but its intriguing how emotional and emphathetic they are. I like (which may actually be upsetting to some viewers) also that they are fallible in that they dont always solve their cases, or they do and yet the suspects will get away with it which mimics reality.I have recommended CSI to many people but usually tell them to rent one of the dvd's from the first season since there are some subplots to the show so its better to start at the start especially since a good video store should have the first three seasons on dvd.I really hope this review will get you intrigued to watch at least one episode.

735376,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00008972G,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[13, 15]","The original `CSI' set in Las Vegas and its spin-offs, all done in the Jerry Bruckheimer shop, easily deserve all the popularity they have garnered since they first appeared five seasons ago. The point of this essay and review is to ponder the source of their quality and resulting popularity.In some ways, as the precursor to some other high quality shows such as `Numbers' and `House, M.D', `CSI' has dealt and played the `Sherlock Holmes' card to the hilt, spicing their stories with whodunit puzzles which would have taxed even that most marvelous of scientific detectives. Both Holmes and `CSI' dealt not only with puzzles, but with puzzles solvable by scientific methods.I am not sure if this is a source of the show's popularity, but I can attest, as a former analytical chemist, that virtually all of their scientific techniques, and the way they show them, are dead on accurate. Sometimes, there is a bit of sloppiness, as when one of the supporting scientists back at the lab is a bit too fast on the draw with an automatic micropipette, and mananges to draw up about as much air as they do sample, but otherwise, they push the envelope very little at the edge of modern forensic and chemical science.I suspect that next to the interesting puzzles, the biggest interest in `CSI' lies in the accuracy of the relations between the CSI team members. In contrast, I offer the opinion that `NCIS', an almost direct copy of `CSI' is really a very weak shadow of it's paradigm in that the relations between the team members are comic book images of how real knowledge based law enforcement officers would act toward one another.`NCIS' may offer the argument that they are much more action based than is `CSI'. While this is true, I think it does not make up for the artificial behavior of it's principle characters.`CSI', on the other hand, plays practically all personal relations with a very light and very deft touch. The sexual tension between Katherine and Warrick shows up just now and then and in very carefully choreographed scenes. The slightly more overt tension between Sara and mardarin Grissom is done even better.The highlight of the first season's running backstory was based on office politics and the loyalty of Grissom for his team members, in spite of their negligences. The first half of the season is just a bit shaky, as the actors and writers are setting into their roles, with Captain Brass's character undergoing the biggest changes from CSI chief to antagonist to ally.`CSI's greatest claim to verisimilatude lies in Grissom's forensic entomology, which places the reputation of the Las Vegas crime lab high in the ranks of the country's major forensic facilities. I would really be interested in knowing if the Las Vegas lab is really as good as it's fictional counterpart. I do know that while forensic entomology is every bit as arcane as the show makes it out to be, it is NOT fiction, but the real thing.I am really happy to see a drama of such high quality get such high ratings. It almost makes up for the slip in acclaim and quality over in `The West Wing' camp.",5,"Intelligent, very human drama.

735385,A3BVRA2QL3TIOQ,B00008972G,carl womack,"[2, 3]","When I first started watching Columbo, I often wanted to be a detective. When I first started watching Mike Hammer, I often wanted to be a detective. When I watched Magnum P.I., I often wanted to be a detective. Now I watch CSI, and I do not want to be a detective. In fact, after watching one episode, I went up to a guy I went to school with who is now a coroner, shook his hand and told him he was the better man. I told him he had more guts than I did, in that I would not ever want his job. This is not a TV show for those (like myself) who cannot eat pizza after seeing someone's charred body, as is sometimes seen on the show. CSI holds no punches. Shows like Columbo, Mike Hammer, and Magnum, while at times are bloody, give the viewer a more &quot;romantic side&quot; of the occupation so to speak, while CSI gives you an almost raw view of what it is really like to work in the detective field. In short, detective work really isn't a glamorous occupation. If someone's brains are blown out, CSI shows you up close, all the little noodles (which of course remind me of purple macaroni, thus disgusting me from eating macaroni for awhile). If a lady has her eyeball fall out, they show the eyeball up close (do you get the picture?) Still, this is a show that is very intriguing. Of course you want to watch it to find out if they catch the murderer(IF it is a murder, which on this program, sometimes it is not). Like most any detective show, it's the CSI teams' expertise in the field and their luck, that helps them put the pieces together, and CSI does it in such a manner as to make MOST of their shows believable. And the reason I stress MOST, is that sometimes, their shows do tend to go out there. I have beyond perfect vision in one eye, and perfect vision in the other, and even I would have a hard time seeing some of the things they seem to spot a mile away with their mini flashlights. But even with this one flaw, CSI is a show I look forward to watching week after week. I also love CSI Miami. CSI gets its entertainment value from the relief of the cases being solved.

But everyone seems to love it, including my moronic neighbors who rag on The X-Files and love CSI. Stop right there, folks.The X-Files was a gem, at least through season 6. But even the bad seasons are better than CSI. All three of these shows are bad, with NY being slightly redeemed by Gary Sinise, but the show is so uninspired and tries so hard to be gruesome that I just have to feel sorry for it.Last time I checked, detectives do not all look like they belong in an Abercrombie mag. To prove my point, the girls I know that watch the show like it because ""the guys are so hot!"" Gimme a break, please. Good looking people does not make for good television.I loved Gillian Anderson on the X-Files because she was thick-skinned, didn't take bull from anyone, and there were no lame side stories involving her. But the female characters here are morons, clearly hired to pile up viewers. And the thing is, the FOX network wanted a different Dana Scully because Anderson didn't have enough sex appeal. Sad, it really is. We're supposed to slobber over some fake-looking, idiotic female lead who in real life would have no conscious clue about being in that work. Pathetic.And the other problem with CSI. The whole NIN choppy, quick-cut style that looks like it came right out of SAW. Now, maybe, SAW jacked that quality, but it looks outright dumb on a show that's supposed to be professional. And choosing The Who for theme songs? What, are these characters going out for a night on the town or are they doing police work? I expected them to start dancing right in the middle of an autopsy! Good god.Point is, The X-Files was incredibly inspired, fun to watch, and had the two best leads in David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in history. Not to mention it was incredibly complicated, which is good. CSI dumbs down forensic work so that tubbys can sit home all night and get lost in its pathetic gruesomeness. X-Files was cleverly gory. CSI tries too hard going for shock value. It really is like the T.V. version of SAW. ""Look at these kids popping random pills at a party, only to get their heads blown off by an intruder! Which makes you wonder the point of them doing drugs to begin with! Then let's do some stylistic special effects to cut upstairs real quick and show another dead girl bleeding through the floor! Neato!"" Or..."" Let's show this guy swallow some kobe, only to graphically cut to some horrible computer animation showing a tapeworm connecting himself to the guy's tissue! How fun! Which would totally eliminate the need for an investigation anyways because the guy just got his meat a little too rare...""I don't know how this drivel stayed on T.V., but it's really, REALLY corny. Anyone who disagrees with me, which everyone will, doesn't know what good television is. The X-files is good dramatic television. People are gonna argue and say that it's about fake things like ghosts and aliens and such, but that's the point! Turn on the freakin' news to hear some graphic murder story! Television should be an escape to something fun, and for me, CSI is about as enthralling as watching paint dry.",2,"Christ, What a Dumb Show...",1222473600,"09 27, 2008",2008,3182,"['Okay', 'CSI', 'such', 'standard', 'show', 'really', 'hard', 'watch', 'everyone', 'love', 'including', 'moronic', 'neighbors', 'who', 'rag', 'X-Files', 'love', 'CSI', 'Stop', 'right', 'there', 'folks.The', 'X-Files', 'was', 'gem', 'least', 'season', '6', 'even', 'bad', 'seasons', 'are', 'better', 'CSI', 'three', 'shows', 'are', 'bad', 'NY', 'being', 'slightly', 'redeemed', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'show', 'so', 'uninspired', 'tries', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'gruesome', 'just', 'have', 'feel', 'sorry', 'it.Last', 'time', 'checked', 'detectives', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'belong', 'Abercrombie', 'mag', 'prove', 'point', 'girls', 'know', 'watch', 'show', 'guys', 'are', 'so', 'hot', 'Gim', 'break', 'please', 'Good', 'looking', 'people', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'television.I', 'loved', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'X-Files', 'was', 'thick-skinned', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'bull', 'anyone', 'were', 'lame', 'side', 'stories', 'involving', 'female', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'morons', 'clearly', 'hired', 'pile', 'up', 'viewers', 'thing', 'FOX', 'network', 'wanted', 'different', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'Anderson', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'sex', 'appeal', 'Sad', 'really', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'slobber', 'fake-looking', 'idiotic', 'female', 'lead', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'conscious', 'clue', 'being', 'work', 'Pathetic.And', 'other', 'problem', 'CSI', 'whole', 'NIN', 'choppy', 'quick-cut', 'style', 'came', 'right', 'SAW', 'Now', 'maybe', 'SAW', 'jacked', 'quality', 'outright', 'dumb', 'show', 'supposed', 'be', 'professional', 'choosing', 'Who', 'theme', 'songs', 'What', 'are', 'characters', 'going', 'out', 'night', 'town', 'are', 'doing', 'police', 'work', 'expected', 'start', 'dancing', 'right', 'middle', 'autopsy', 'Good', 'god.Point', 'X-Files', 'was', 'incredibly', 'inspired', 'fun', 'watch', 'had', 'two', 'best', 'leads', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'history', 'Not', 'mention', 'was', 'incredibly', 'complicated', 'good', 'CSI', 'dumbs', 'down', 'forensic', 'work', 'so', 'tubbys', 'can', 'sit', 'home', 'night', 'get', 'lost', 'pathetic', 'gruesomeness', 'X-Files', 'was', 'cleverly', 'gory', 'CSI', 'too', 'hard', 'going', 'shock', 'value', 'really', 'T.V', 'version', 'SAW', 'Look', 'kids', 'popping', 'random', 'pills', 'party', 'only', 'get', 'heads', 'blown', 'off', 'intruder', 'Which', 'wonder', 'point', 'doing', 'drugs', 'begin', 'Then', 'let', 'do', 'stylistic', 'special', 'effects', 'cut', 'upstairs', 'real', 'quick', 'show', 'dead', 'girl', 'bleeding', 'floor', 'Neato', 'Let', 'show', 'guy', 'swallow', 'kobe', 'only', 'graphically', 'cut', 'horrible', 'computer', 'animation', 'showing', 'tapeworm', 'connecting', 'guy', 'tissue', 'How', 'fun', 'Which', 'would', 'totally', 'eliminate', 'need', 'investigation', 'anyways', 'guy', 'just', 'got', 'meat', 'little', 'too', 'rare', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'stayed', 'T.V.', 'really', 'REALLY', 'Anyone', 'who', 'everyone', 'will', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'good', 'television', 'X-files', 'good', 'dramatic', 'television', 'People', 'are', 'gon', 'argue', 'say', 'fake', 'things', 'ghosts', 'aliens', 'such', 'point', 'Turn', 'freakin', 'news', 'hear', 'graphic', 'murder', 'story', 'Television', 'should', 'be', 'escape', 'something', 'fun', 'CSI', 'as', 'enthralling', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry']",N/A

Season 1 is where it all started, and doesn't miss a beat in terms of show or acting quality.  Every episode of this show has me glued to the screen, and it doesn't stop here either (see season 2,3,4, and beyond).This show remains one of the top couple shows in the ratings, and has brought about a huge new interest in forensic science.  Colleges across the country are starting new criminal science programs or increasing their existing ones.  This show is not only incredibly interesting, but is also making an actual difference in the world.  There are few shoes on TV today that can say that.William Petersen's acting is simply brilliant as Gil Grissim, and with marvolous support from actors and actresses like Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows), George Eads (Nick Stokes), Gary Dourdan (Warrick Brown), Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle), Paul Guilfoyle (Captain Jim Brass), and Eric Szmanda (Greg Sanders), the show can't (and doesn't in any way) miss.

Why? The answer is simple: CSI.In October 2000, CBS debuted a new crime drama not about police, lawyers, or criminals, but about the scientists behind the scenes who solve the mysteries. For years now, we've been hearing about DNA evidence and fingerprints, but only with the emergence of this new series were we able, for the first time, to see how it all gets done. The show - which since its beginning has remained #1 worldwide - was none other than CSI. And this DVD set takes you back to where it all began.The collection shows off the series' first season, from the ""Pilot"" episode (featuring investigator Holly Gribbs) to the season finale, with all stops in between. Filled with comedy, tragedy, and white-knuckled drama, the first season of CSI had it all. For the first time, we were introduced to the enigmatic and slightly offbeat entomologist Gil Grissom (William Petersen), exotic dancer-turned-scientist Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger), the fun-loving investigator Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan), the laid-back cowboy Nick Stokes (George Eads), the fiery and stubborn Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), the witty and cantankerous Detective Jim Brass (Paul Guilfoyle), and the two characters who would become series regulars - zany lab tech Greg Sanders (Eric Szmanda) and the humorous coroner Dr. Al Robbins (Robert David Hall).Some of the first season highlights include: ""Cool Change"", the first episode featuring Sara Sidle; ""Blood Drops"", featuring a young Dakota Fanning; and ""Strip Strangler"", the explosive season finale.In addition to featuring all of the first season episodes (and the ""Previously on CSI"" bits that aired with a few of them), the DVD set includes a music video to the show's theme song, ""Who Are You"" by The Who (a concert interspersed with scenes from the show), character profiles, and an interview with the show's creators and cast about its beginnings.As a relatively new CSI fan, this DVD set provided me with the chance to get the background information on both the LVPD Crime Lab and the characters I've come to know and love.

I always loved to watch anything where there was a crime committed and you got to see someone figure it out and all the twists and turns that came along for the ride.

They're the people working behind the scenes that really get the job done and I think that's why I dig this show so much.

Davidson,"[5, 5]","CSI is simply the best US police procedural drama (which, given how many there are, is saying quite a lot).The stories are strong and there is a cast of interesting characters. The central character, Gil Grissom (brilliantly played by William Peterson) is the reason it works so well. Grissom is wonderful character - an introverted and rather unemotional man, a serious scientist who happens to be a criminologist. As such he is free for most of the traditional TV cop baggage, giving the whole series a fresh and interesting perspective. In this series, the CSI team gets on with investigating crime scenes and solving mysteries attempting, but not always succeeding, to do this without bias or preconceptions. They leave the police work to others. Unfortunately, this model was abandoned with CSI: Miami making it a much less interesting program.The rest of the cast is also very, very good bringing complex and interesting characters to life. Marg Helgenberger as ex-exotic dancer Catherine Willows is particularly good.Danny Boyle directs most of the episodes with great style (redeeming himself after the failure of Judge Dread), even his habit of focussing in at a microscopic level (e.g. looking at blood vessels etc) works well. Setting the series in Las Vegas works well - the city, the desert, the mountains - they all provide great backdrops and look fantastic.This is not the best CSI series (the show really got going in series 2) but it makes sense to start at the beginning.",5,Top rate crime drama,1112745600,"04 6, 2005",2005,1490,"['CSI', 'simply', 'best', 'US', 'police', 'procedural', 'drama', 'given', 'how', 'many', 'are', 'saying', 'quite', 'lot', '.The', 'stories', 'are', 'strong', 'cast', 'interesting', 'characters', 'central', 'character', 'Gil', 'Grissom', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'William', 'Peterson', 'reason', 'so', 'well', 'Grissom', 'wonderful', 'character', 'introverted', 'rather', 'unemotional', 'man', 'serious', 'scientist', 'who', 'be', 'criminologist', 'such', 'free', 'most', 'traditional', 'TV', 'cop', 'baggage', 'giving', 'whole', 'series', 'fresh', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'series', 'CSI', 'team', 'investigating', 'crime', 'scenes', 'solving', 'mysteries', 'attempting', 'not', 'always', 'succeeding', 'do', 'bias', 'preconceptions', 'leave', 'police', 'work', 'others', 'Unfortunately', 'model', 'was', 'abandoned', 'CSI', 'Miami', 'making', 'much', 'less', 'interesting', 'program.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'bringing', 'complex', 'interesting', 'characters', 'life', 'Marg', 'Helgenberger', 'ex-exotic', 'dancer', 'Catherine', 'Willows', 'particularly', 'good.Danny', 'Boyle', 'most', 'episodes', 'great', 'style', 'redeeming', 'failure', 'Judge', 'Dread', 'even', 'habit', 'focussing', 'microscopic', 'level', 'e.g', 'looking', 'blood', 'vessels', 'etc', 'well', 'Setting', 'series', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'well', 'city', 'desert', 'mountains', 'provide', 'great', 'backdrops', 'look', 'fantastic.This', 'not', 'best', 'CSI', 'series', 'show', 'really', 'got', 'going', 'series', '2', 'sense', 'start', 'beginning']",N/A

I don't think there's a single crime lab on Earth that looks anything like this. It's what you'd expect people who've never stepped foot in a real crime lab to manufacture. Plenty of mood lighting, brushed stainless steel and glass everywhere. Aesthetics are not of primary concern to the architects that build these facilities. Plus everyone in this show seems to be beautiful or handsome. What are the chances that so many attractive people would end up in the forensic science field? I also love how every actor explains everything to each other like nobody knows anything. Every time they take a measurement, or a sample, or they scratch their nose the camera has to zoom in, and then a bunch of explanatory visual flashes. At first their kinda cool, but their novelty wares off very quickly. I know they're trying to educate the viewer by treating them like their an idiot, but we're not all idiots, so why do we have to be dragged down to their level? Do CSI's carry firearms, question people, or arrest people?

Gil Grissom, Catherine Willows, Nick Stokes, Warrick Brown and the rest of the characters are played perfecty by their counterparts. The science in the show is very in-depth and taken from cases that had been in the news and they basically did offshoots of them. The one thing I love about CSI is the amount of twists you get per show. The evidence collecting, analyzing and very real and very thorough and heres the best part.... they explain everything they're doing so your not left in the dark as to what they just did with that eye dropper or UV light bar and what they're looking for. Terrific first season.A must watch for those who like a really good mystery.Amid the lights of the Strip and the fast action on the tables of Las Vegas is a dedicated task force in the city's police department: the Crime Scenes Investigation Unit, the most highly touted lab in the nation. Headed by Det. Gil Grissom (William L. Petersen), CSI takes on the goriest, most disturbing of cases that would baffle other units. This collection includes all 23 episodes that make up the first season of CBS's groundbreaking series.There is a reason this is the best show on television.It's just incredible, it completely pulls you in and keeps you enthrall and intrigued until the end. I love that fact that science is being show as an art, a craft, an a pure gift; not just something that involves ""geeks"" with the stereo-typical lab coat and pocket protectors. The cast is superb, I love Grissom's off beat humor and interesting random bits of knowledge, I also love Cathrine Willows whom many simply presume is snappy and cynical - but it's obvious there's more to her. All the characters have multiple layers of depth, with is constantly - but not overly, examined as the seasons progresses.The show is primarily about the crimes, which is why I enjoy it so much; but through each episode you learn another piece of information about one of the characters, in a subtle way. Take for example episode #105 entitled ""Friends and Lovers"" in that episode we learn the distinct types of cases that really get beneath Gil Grissom's skin; men who beat their wives, sexual abuse on children, and the scum that pedal death to kids. It's things like that, so simply and forwardly offered up about character, but not analyzed in a sappy or over-the-top fashion that I treasure about this show.

The investigators use common sense as well as they sometimes put their lives on the line putting their gloved hands in everythingwhether it be human remains or the garbage which always holds the unknown and undesirable. Many times what you may think to be fact is proven wrong by evidence. Theories are stated with no assumptions formed. After viewing CSI, the other crime dramas or crime thrillers on television seem outdated with less appeal.The cast is small yet effective. The opening & closing theme song "" Who are you ? "" by the musical group The Who applies to the entire program as many people are ""John Does"" or ""Jane Does"" unless they can be found. Computer technology is used on every show in addition to laboratory facilities,blood & tissue samples of victims & suspects,crime scene photos and routine questioning of many involved. The investigators make a conscious effort to notice every detail of everything making sure they see small things that otherwise are commonly overlooked.They also make sure to remember what they heard. Everything is obvious no matter how hard one may try to hide it. Cover-ups,serial rapists,killers and accidental deaths are solved by evidence and teamwork. The visual & sound effects along with re-creations of the crimes and crime scenes display intense training. Hopefully this exceptional program will continue in this way. This is a don't miss for people who appreciate great mysteries solved.The Dvd set is filled with 23 episodes that are 45 minutes each,A program this well written and acted is a welcome surprise.One can't compare this to any other crime drama-thriller on television as it is an entirely new approach.I Highly recommend Crime Scene Investigations to everyone who appreciates a great mystery solved.

The black guy with the green eyes(Gary Dourdan) leaves a rookie CSI agent by herself when she is dusting for fingerprints at a robbery/homicide crime scene.After he leaves, the killer naturally comes back and kills the rookie cop.The reason Dourdan leaves is to go place a bet on a pro football game.He is placing a bet for a judge that he is bribing to get a search warrant for on a case he is working.Dourdan places the bet on the opposite team that the judge asked him to bet on and loses.Meanwhile, the rookie CSI agent is being killed.After the whole thing goes down, Dourdan is at first put on administrative leave but then re-instated once Will Petersen takes over at the end of the show.He vows to do better next time.WTF?  Wouldn't he have at least been fired for abandoning his post?  I would think he would be criminally prosecuted also for leaving the rookie unprotected.Dourdan seemed to be more concerned about solving his case than the slain officer and the lack of emotion was terribly played out.Petersen, Helgenberg, and the other officers also seemed remorseless and had a ""well, we need to move on"" attitude.  By the next show the rookie is completely forgotten and it's business as usual.So much for this so-called drama.As you watch more and more the storylines tend to all be the same.  Two crimes, they solve the crime within the same episode, and nobody gets wrongly accused.The show is supposed to be based on Las Vegas, but I wager it's really taking place in Fantasyland.For much better dramatic police shows, I recommend HBO's ""The Wire"", and FX's ""The Shield"".",2,Insults your intelligence,1138752000,"02 1, 2006",2006,1713,"['hype', 'have', 'sad', 'news', 'report', 'Overrated', 'start', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'Pilot', 'black', 'guy', 'green', 'eyes', 'Gary', 'Dourdan', 'rookie', 'CSI', 'agent', 'herself', 'when', 'dusting', 'fingerprints', 'robbery/homicide', 'crime', 'scene.After', 'killer', 'naturally', 'back', 'rookie', 'cop.The', 'reason', 'Dourdan', 'go', 'place', 'bet', 'pro', 'football', 'game.He', 'placing', 'bet', 'judge', 'bribing', 'get', 'search', 'warrant', 'case', 'working.Dourdan', 'places', 'bet', 'opposite', 'team', 'judge', 'asked', 'bet', 'loses.Meanwhile', 'rookie', 'CSI', 'agent', 'being', 'killed.After', 'whole', 'thing', 'down', 'Dourdan', 'first', 'put', 'administrative', 'leave', 'then', 're-instated', 'once', 'Will', 'Petersen', 'over', 'end', 'show.He', 'vows', 'do', 'better', 'next', 'time.WTF', 'Would', ""n't"", 'have', 'least', 'been', 'fired', 'abandoning', 'post', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'criminally', 'prosecuted', 'also', 'leaving', 'rookie', 'unprotected.Dourdan', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'concerned', 'solving', 'case', 'slain', 'officer', 'lack', 'emotion', 'was', 'terribly', 'played', 'out.Petersen', 'Helgenberg', 'other', 'officers', 'also', 'seemed', 'remorseless', 'had', 'well', 'need', 'move', 'attitude', 'next', 'show', 'rookie', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'business', 'usual.So', 'much', 'so-called', 'drama.As', 'watch', 'more', 'more', 'storylines', 'tend', 'be', 'same', 'Two', 'crimes', 'solve', 'crime', 'same', 'episode', 'nobody', 'wrongly', 'accused.The', 'show', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'wager', 'really', 'taking', 'place', 'Fantasyland.For', 'much', 'better', 'dramatic', 'police', 'shows', 'recommend', 'HBO', 'Wire', 'FX', 'Shield']",N/A

Blessed with wonderful scripts, superb acting, imaginative music and cinematography, the series deserves its years of high ratings.  The main reason is the intelligence with which the writers show in their viewers; not every episode has a wrapped up ending; the villains don't always get caught and the regulars have their own personal demons to deal with.  The show's foundation is William Petersen, who brings a depth of dimension to his role as the chief of the forensics team.  At times harsh and apparently unfeeling, he can turn around and show much empathy and compassion and he cares about his team.  Marg Helgenberger as former stripper Katherine is a single mother, recently separated from her two timing husband (Timothy Carhart); she is right on target as a woman trying to mix a career and family; George Eads is the hunky Nick, whose desire to please Grissom results in some poor decisions, but one can't deny his dedication; Gary Dourand's Warrick is a gambling addict having difficulty shaking the habit; Jorja Fox is the workaholic and lonely Sarah, who has a fierce loyalty and determination; Eric Zmandza is wonderful as the laidback but frenetic Greg, and Paul Guilfoyle is marvelous as former CSI chief, now detective.  The entire supporting cast of regulars is perfect.  The show hooks you right away with the lead in case, and it's not always murder!

I never liked ""crime"" shows: I don't watch law and order, NYPD Blue, ER, or any of the other versions.  When I started watching these episodes, I became hooked very rapidly.  As many other individuals have mentioned, it's definitely the characters.  I became quickly engrossed in the principal character Gil Grissom, who reminds me of myself.I'm a law student who is willing to take a very dispassionate view of the events in the world.  So does Grissom.  Grissom is an expert in insects who uses his knowledge and skills for the benefit of discovering the killers or suspects in a crime scene.  Many people would be reasonably envious of how dedicated Grissom is towards his job.  One thing that is quite different about the character Grissom is that he is an objective scientist; it is not his job to try to make someone guilty if the evidence does not point in that direction.  Instead, Mr. Grissom is even willing to look through the evidence to clear someone's name.

735437,A3FOCW2R5LP3X4,B00008972G,Michael Kent,"[4, 5]","I've always wondered how people come up with their product ratings. Do they rate based entirely on the show, the show and the extras or the overall package?If I were to rate this based on the series itself, I'd rate it five stars. But, help me those who might be in the same position, the packaging on mine is a little different.First off, mine features a slightly disrorted picture of Grissom and Catherine on the front, not the entire CSI gang...plus it's bilingual. On the front, below CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, it says, in brackets (Les Experts). The episode listing on the back and inside are also bilingual, leading me to conclude that the version I picked up is some weird Canadian version (since I am from Canada, this makes sense, I suppose).The contents are otherwise the same, it is presented in full screen and all the episodes and features are there. For me, though, it loses half a star because of the packaging. Season one, though, is the hardest to find and I got this a a decent price, so no more complaints on that end.I took the other half star away because of two things...the full screen...wide screen works much better for this show...and a very annoying problem with the subtitles in which, instead of turning them on if needed, you are obligated to turn them off every time you put a DVD into the machine as it automatically brings them up. I've never seen anything like this...so instead of putting in the disk and choosing an episode to watch, you first have to go into ""Settings"", turn off the subtitles, then back into the episode listings and choose a show.Once you're in, however, the experience is worth it. I was one of those skeptical people who didn't tune in when the show first started. I had read the hype and I didn't understand it. Part of that is because I don't like being told what the best show on TV is through the press...it's their job to overhype certain shows and later to trash them once they become overhyped (which we see in some circles with CSI). I'd rather watch a show because I take pleasure in discovering for myself what a pleasure it is to watch.So, in a way, I did so, tuning in one night to Spike TV during one of it's CSI Marathons which covered most of the first season.I remember being impressed right away by the cast...William Peterson is perfect is Gil Grissom a man dedicated to solving cases through science...Marg Helgenberger is spot on as Catherine Willows, the former exotic dancer and single mom who is struggling to find a balance between work and her daughter. I liked the tension between Catherine and Grissom when their personalities clash.Nick, Warrick, Sarah, Greg, Dr. Robbins and Brass are all extremely well played, with Jorja Fox getting one of the best opening lines during Grissom's dummy toss in ""Cool Change"" (Grissom: ""Norman fell."" Sarah: ""Wouldn't you if you were married to Mrs. Roper?"").We are introduced to Holly Gribbs, only to have her gunned down. We find out Warrick has a gambling problem (and a memory problem, though I, too would have probably bet the Niners over the Packers)...we learn that Sarah has a thing for Grissom who has a thing for insects. Greg is the comic relief...at least at the start and Nick is the most compassionate of the bunch.We are introduced to Paul Milander, a criminal genious who would pop up a few times...each time more disturbing than the time before...a brilliant storyline in my opinion.Other highlights in season one include the Pilot, Blood Drops (excellent twist in that story), Unfriendly Skies (""...it would have taken just one to save his life.""), I-15 Murders, Boom, Too Tough To Die (which shows how flawed the court system is... just because someone doesn't die and will live their life as a vegetable...the assailant can't be tried for murder), Gentle, Gentle and Evaluation Day (Warrick and Grissom on the roller coaster...Warrick's 'evaluation').So, I would highly recommend this set...in it's regular version.

I have watched this program from season one .. I love it. I think the season one of CSI takes you through the topics for forensics like you are a newbie at this but in a very smart way. The topics they cover range from murder, blood drops, glass fragments, serial killer, fingerprints, handwriting analysis, and other trace evidence. CSI is an excellent show that introduces the veiwer to the various forensic studies. In addition, the charaters are cool, likeable, and you identify with them very easily.

I have season 1 and I have a great time having uninterrupted commercial free CSI marathons. What makes this show so interesting to me is how they use science to solve the crimes. If I had known science could lead to that type of a career opportunity, I would have taken the extra science classes in school when I was younger!!! You get 23 episodes on 6 DVDs. The 6th DVD has three episodes and then some extras. I wish they would have put the character profiles on the first DVD instead of the 6th. The show tends to use real life criminal cases for their shows. Some of the shows I recognized cases discussed on the news. Another good thing about shows on DVD? You get to see the missed episodes you did not catch during the original broadcast. I thought I caught all the shows on TV, but turned out I had not seen Who Are you, Pledging Mr. Johnson, Blood Drops, Unfriendly Skies, Boom, Sounds of Silence, and Justice is Served. I enjoy how visual the show is, and the show focus is on the crime, not Las Vegas. You may see a backdrop of Vegas at the beginning of the show or during the show, but that?s about it.Gil Grissom is an old school forensic scientist. He likes to use the hands on approach to solving crimes. He loves to solve puzzles, and he tries not to let his emotions get in the way of doing his job. After a major shooting of one of the other forensic investigators he ends up becoming the supervisor of the night shift, while Brass is sent back to homicide. There is always a tug of war between the police and the forensic investigators. Grissom hates three things. 1. Guys who hit their wives, Sexual assault on children, and scum who deal to kids.Grissom supervises Katherine Willows a former ""erotic dancer"" who is a divorced single mom of a young girl. The very handsome Nick, who is always in competition with Warrick (another handsome man, those eyes, those lips, that hair!!!!) who has a gambling problem, and new comer Sarah who wants acceptance, but demands respect. She has a hard time keeping her emotions in check. Especially during the sexual assault cases, but Katherine is the same way during a case that deals with the death of a child. Reginald Vel Johnson (Family Matters) has a role in three episodes of season 1 as a Psychologist.I enjoy watching all the cases, but my favorite cases are the following:1. Unfriendly Skies2.

Arguably one of the most interesting shows on TV, you can now see it from the very beginning.  All 23 shows season are here, including BLOOD DROPS, which was one of the best episodes that season.  Packed in a plastic case, all 6 discs are surprisingly bare.  While there is a featurette and a a Music video, there are also a lack of scene selection in every episode, as well as a menu that seems very simple for such an expensive set.Even the packaging is rather bland, with the only cool thing about it is the yellow ""crime scene"" tape across the box.  Perhaps I'm just spoiled by Fox's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, The Simpsons, and Angel DVD sets where you at least get fold out sets and liner booklets.  This set has the discs piled on top of each other in a fold out plastic cover and that's it.Other than the bare bones look of the set, the show itself more than makes up for it and the set is worth getting.

735461,A1LZVU5SRRM3VX,B00008972G,Timothy Michael Resh,"[2, 3]","I don't watch much TV.  Not only do a one-year old, a demanding job, and performing with two choral ensembles take up much of my time, but TV has not exactly been cranking out stellar material lately.  Even shows I used to watch regularly, like NYPD Blue and ER, have largely gone to seed.  In fact, if it weren't for televised sporting events, I would barely watch TV at all these days because of all of the ""reality"" shows that I utterly despise.  But you're reading this to find out my opinion of CSI, not of television in general, so before I digress further, let's talk CSI.CSI was a phenomenon that I somehow didn't catch on to until midway through the second season.  My father-in-law turned on the show while we were visiting over Christmas 2002 and asked if we had ever watched it before.  Neither my wife nor I had.  The episode we caught happened to be a rerun from the first season, but we were nonetheless thoroughly impressed.  Unfortunately, it airs on Thursday night, a rehearsal night for both of our choral groups, so we rarely get to see it and always forget to record it.  Therefore, we have thoroughly enjoyed watching the first season on DVD.Not only are the stories well-acted, thoughtful, unpredictable, and compelling (especially the episodes on Disc 6!)  but you get them in digital quality and commercial-free.  For someone who has not yet made the move to HDTV, this means a significant improvement in sound and video quality over cable quality.  Although a few of the digital transfers were a bit fuzzy at times, the stories are so interesting that I was willing to overlook this minor glitch.Perhaps the best thing about Season One is that you get to know the characters and their strengths and flaws intimately.  Another strength of the series is that there are a number of subplots that are explored periodically throughout the first season (e.g., Warrick's gambling problem, Catherine's ex-husband, the funeral director who ""recycles"" coffins, and the young hit-and-run driver and his grandfather).  The writers touch on these topics often enough to keep them interesting, but not so often that they become tiresome.Although the episodes can become a bit graphic in some instances and may not be appropriate for children, the special effects used to recreate the crime scenes and occasionally the fatal injuries sustained by the victim are feature-film quality, probably thanks to Jerry Bruckheimer's involvement.  The violence or gore is never gratuitous, and is always critical to the storyline, but if you are squeamish or uncomfortable with blood or discussion of forensic evidence, then this is probably not the show for you.Although each episode explores a different set of crimes, the characters and their quirky interactions provide continuity between episodes.  As such, the series benefits from more or less consecutive viewing.  Without commercials, each episode lasts only 45 minutes or so, thereby meaning that the hour and a half one would normally commit to a feature film nets two excellent episodes of perhaps the best drama on TV today.",5,"Intelligent, Well-Acted Television, Commercial Free!",1074038400,"01 14, 2004",2004,3087,"['do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'much', 'TV', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'one-year', 'old', 'demanding', 'job', 'performing', 'two', 'choral', 'ensembles', 'take', 'up', 'much', 'time', 'TV', 'not', 'exactly', 'been', 'cranking', 'out', 'stellar', 'material', 'lately', 'Even', 'used', 'watch', 'regularly', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'ER', 'have', 'largely', 'gone', 'seed', 'fact', 'were', ""n't"", 'televised', 'sporting', 'events', 'would', 'barely', 'watch', 'TV', 'days', 'reality', 'utterly', 'despise', ""'re"", 'reading', 'find', 'out', 'opinion', 'CSI', 'not', 'television', 'general', 'digress', 'further', 'let', 'talk', 'CSI.CSI', 'was', 'phenomenon', 'somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'midway', 'second', 'season', 'father-in-law', 'turned', 'show', 'were', 'visiting', 'Christmas', '2002', 'asked', 'had', 'ever', 'watched', 'wife', 'had', 'episode', 'caught', 'happened', 'be', 'rerun', 'first', 'season', 'were', 'nonetheless', 'thoroughly', 'impressed', 'Unfortunately', 'Thursday', 'night', 'rehearsal', 'night', 'choral', 'groups', 'rarely', 'get', 'see', 'always', 'forget', 'record', 'Therefore', 'have', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'DVD.Not', 'only', 'are', 'stories', 'well-acted', 'thoughtful', 'unpredictable', 'compelling', 'especially', 'episodes', 'Disc', '6', 'get', 'digital', 'quality', 'commercial-free', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'yet', 'made', 'move', 'HDTV', 'significant', 'improvement', 'sound', 'video', 'quality', 'cable', 'quality', 'few', 'digital', 'transfers', 'were', 'bit', 'fuzzy', 'times', 'stories', 'are', 'so', 'interesting', 'was', 'willing', 'overlook', 'minor', 'best', 'thing', 'Season', 'One', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'strengths', 'flaws', 'intimately', 'strength', 'series', 'are', 'number', 'subplots', 'are', 'explored', 'periodically', 'first', 'season', 'e.g.', 'Warrick', 'gambling', 'problem', 'Catherine', 'ex-husband', 'funeral', 'director', 'who', 'recycles', 'coffins', 'young', 'hit-and-run', 'driver', 'grandfather', 'writers', 'touch', 'topics', 'often', 'enough', 'keep', 'interesting', 'not', 'so', 'often', 'become', 'episodes', 'can', 'become', 'bit', 'graphic', 'instances', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'appropriate', 'children', 'special', 'effects', 'used', 'recreate', 'crime', 'scenes', 'occasionally', 'fatal', 'injuries', 'sustained', 'victim', 'are', 'feature-film', 'quality', 'probably', 'thanks', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'involvement', 'violence', 'gore', 'never', 'gratuitous', 'always', 'critical', 'storyline', 'are', 'squeamish', 'uncomfortable', 'blood', 'discussion', 'forensic', 'evidence', 'then', 'probably', 'not', 'show', 'you.Although', 'episode', 'different', 'set', 'crimes', 'characters', 'quirky', 'interactions', 'provide', 'continuity', 'episodes', 'such', 'series', 'benefits', 'more', 'less', 'consecutive', 'viewing', 'commercials', 'episode', 'only', '45', 'minutes', 'so', 'thereby', 'meaning', 'hour', 'half', 'one', 'would', 'normally', 'commit', 'feature', 'film', 'nets', 'two', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'perhaps', 'best', 'drama', 'TV', 'today']",N/A
