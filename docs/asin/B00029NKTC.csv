828164,A22BVADXCG8HN5,B00029NKTC,An Engineer,"[1, 1]","Michael Bennet (a.k.a. The Slasher) is a freelance auto salesman that travels the country to help dealerships clear out their lots of dead stock.  This film follows Bennet to Memphis, TN where he arrives to help a local Toyota dealership clean out their inventory over a Memorial Day weekend (Thursday through Saturday).Bennet is portrayed as a slick and very high-strung personality who cares about his family even though he feels as if he rarely sees them (he states that he sometimes feels like he is paying for storage space for his family rather than a home, since he is so often gone).  On the job, he wears his tuxedo and walks the lot slashing prices (when he is ""slashing"" the price, the salespeople chant ""Slash it, Slash it"" per presale instructions from Bennet).  With his wireless microphone, he is able to talk to the crowd (or empty lot) all day.  Off the lot, he is portrayed as a heavy beer drinker and smoker.  When not working, he often seems to have a beer in his hand and one (or two) cigarettes going.  His wife calls him to ask him to drink orange juice for breakfast instead of beer (which is his usual breakfast beverage).The film reveals the high-pressure used-auto sales environment and Bennet and his team show no mercy.  They use the lure of door prizes, an $88 car, attractive female models, baselining, and a myriad of persuasion techniques to convince visitors to buy.  His techniques are no doubt effective; however, he runs into trouble with completing the sale due to his prospects' credit ratings.  At one point, a frustrated Bennet states, ""they couldn't finance a piece of bubblegum with $200 down.""Although it portrays the very uncomfortable used-car sales process, this documentary is still quite comedic and overall has a lot of entertainment value.

828165,A2NTJUI2DLZF4R,B00029NKTC,"Craig Chalquist, PhD, author of TERRAPSYCHOLO...","[1, 4]","I wasn't sure what to rate this film because I have mixed feelings about it. On one level it's a fast-paced look at how a used car salesman makes a living cheating poor black people (among others) out of their money. On the other hand, the Slasher is a deeply disturbed father never home for his wife and kids. I found myself getting angry that nobody cared enough for the star of this film to confront him about what he did to himself; in fact, in the featurette you can see the filmmaker trying to make him stand up straight for the camera while dead drunk. I kept wondering how his daughters felt about growing up with an alcoholic father with a beer in his hand every morning. I would very much have liked to see this film end with a scene in which the Slasher's so-called friends and the director gather around him and say, ""We're taking up a collection to get you into rehab before you drink yourself to death. If you don't care about yourself any more than you do about the people you fleece, at least think about what you are doing to your family.""",3,portrait of a tortured soul,1169769600,"01 26, 2007",2007,1056,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'rate', 'film', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'one', 'level', 'fast-paced', 'look', 'how', 'used', 'car', 'salesman', 'living', 'cheating', 'poor', 'black', 'people', 'others', 'money', 'other', 'hand', 'Slasher', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'father', 'never', 'home', 'wife', 'kids', 'found', 'getting', 'angry', 'nobody', 'cared', 'enough', 'star', 'film', 'confront', 'what', 'did', 'fact', 'featurette', 'can', 'see', 'filmmaker', 'trying', 'make', 'stand', 'up', 'straight', 'camera', 'dead', 'drunk', 'kept', 'wondering', 'how', 'daughters', 'felt', 'growing', 'up', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'beer', 'hand', 'morning', 'would', 'very', 'much', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'film', 'end', 'scene', 'Slasher', 'so-called', 'friends', 'director', 'gather', 'say', ""'re"", 'taking', 'up', 'collection', 'get', 'rehab', 'drink', 'death', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'more', 'do', 'people', 'fleece', 'least', 'think', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'family']",Slasher

Michael Bennett is a professional used car salesman who travels around the country helping car dealerships take advantage of morons who actually believe that they are getting good deals.This weekend The Slasher and his two-man ""mercenary"" crew are descending on Memephis like foul-mouth locust.  They spread the word about a $88 car and sure enough here come the suckers.  Unfortunately for Michael most of them have bad credit and no money.  He does end up working his ass off (he even runs out in the road at one point trying to get customers!) and sells over 30 cars.  What I found just as interesting as The Slasher antics was the fact that people actually expected to get cars for next to nothing.  A lot of the would be customers were genuinely disappointed that they couldn't get a $7,000 used SUV for $88!  There was a $88 car, but man oh man was that thing a pile of junk.  It ending up dying a loud death as soon as the girl pulled in her driveway.Playing more like a video diary instead of a actual documentary I myself was a little disappointed myself that we didn't get to see The Slasher in action in different parts of the country.  Did he change his pitch in areas where people actually have money?  Also how did Michael become The Slasher and are there others like him?",3,"""Slash it!  Slash it!

828168,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B00029NKTC,stoic,"[1, 1]","Slasher is a documentary that looks at what it takes to sell used cars. The Slasher's real name is Michael Bennett. He lives in southern California and flies to various car lots around the U.S. where he helps the dealers sell ""stale inventory."" The film focuses both on the tactics that Slasher uses to sell cars and on Slasher's personality.In Slasher, Bennett travels to Memphis, Tennessee, for a 3-day sale at a struggling Toyota dealership. The dealership has a credit-poor, working-class clientele. Slasher's biggest advertising ""hook"" is selling cars for just $88; the catch is that the buyers don't know which cars carry that price. During the sale, Slasher creates excitement by parading around the lot with a microphone while wearing a tuxedo.Bennett hires attractive young women as ""Slashettes"" - hostesses. The film shows Bennett interviewing potential Slashettes. After the interviews, Bennett makes vicious comments about  the interviewees. Viewers also learn that Slasher is an alcoholic, a heavy smoker, and a cynic. Bennett isn't boring, he is - at best - an ambivalent figure.John Landis (""The Blues Brothers"" and ""Trading Places"") returns to directing with Slasher. He adds some great visuals from Memphis and also uses classic Memphis soul as a soundtrack. One veteran salesman recounts how he sold Elvis Presley ""about ten Cadillacs."" Unfortunately, the dialogue is difficult to hear at times.Slasher is an interesting film that reveals a cynical subculture. I recommend the film.",4,The salesman knows nothing of what he is selling save that he is charging a great deal too much for it. - Oscar Wilde,1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,1500,"['Slasher', 'documentary', 'what', 'sell', 'used', 'cars', 'Slasher', 'real', 'name', 'Michael', 'Bennett', 'southern', 'California', 'flies', 'various', 'car', 'lots', 'U.S.', 'where', 'dealers', 'sell', 'stale', 'inventory', 'film', 'tactics', 'Slasher', 'sell', 'cars', 'Slasher', 'personality.In', 'Slasher', 'Bennett', 'Memphis', 'Tennessee', '3-day', 'sale', 'struggling', 'Toyota', 'dealership', 'dealership', 'credit-poor', 'working-class', 'clientele', 'Slasher', 'biggest', 'advertising', 'hook', 'selling', 'cars', 'just', '88', 'catch', 'buyers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'cars', 'carry', 'price', 'sale', 'Slasher', 'excitement', 'parading', 'lot', 'microphone', 'wearing', 'tuxedo.Bennett', 'attractive', 'young', 'women', 'Slashettes', 'hostesses', 'film', 'Bennett', 'interviewing', 'potential', 'Slashettes', 'interviews', 'Bennett', 'vicious', 'comments', 'interviewees', 'Viewers', 'also', 'learn', 'Slasher', 'alcoholic', 'heavy', 'smoker', 'cynic', 'Bennett', ""n't"", 'boring', 'best', 'ambivalent', 'figure.John', 'Landis', 'Blues', 'Brothers', 'Trading', 'Places', 'directing', 'Slasher', 'great', 'visuals', 'Memphis', 'also', 'classic', 'Memphis', 'soul', 'soundtrack', 'One', 'veteran', 'salesman', 'how', 'sold', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'ten', 'Cadillacs', 'Unfortunately', 'dialogue', 'difficult', 'hear', 'times.Slasher', 'interesting', 'film', 'cynical', 'subculture', 'recommend', 'film']",Slasher
828169,A5UMUVEV1RUS9,B00029NKTC,SuperJenn,"[8, 10]","Of course, not all of the clients at my agency are this wacked out. And actually, this is the first time I've seen an $88 car...we usually run $88 down, $88 a month for our clients or they have cars as low as $995 on the lot. What I love about Slasher is that it shows that it takes all kinds. I had a hard time not laughing at some of the customers that showed up on the lot. Folks, I write these ads for a living. I can tell you that if someone's advertising cars for as low as $88, that means that there is just one on the lot and I can tell you that 99% of us would not be caught dead in that car.Ah, but the 1% that would...! Anyone will get a kick out of these customers coming in for that $88 car. I'm sure all our clients would split their sides laughing at this, and perhaps crying too. I know it's hard to move these units. I'm responsible for developing new creative to help guys like you sell more of them. Sales like this will surely bring them in with the Slasher. We run advertorials quite frequently for clients who have used the Slasher before and others with imitations which we must call a different name in order for our clients not to run into legal problems with it.I don't think that only automotive industry people should see this. I happened to stumble upon it while reading about other documentaries. This one was recommended to me and I laughed. I had to find it. One of my assistants saw it was coming on IFC and taped it for our team to see if we could gain new perspective. For me, I gained the perspective that not all my clients are crooks, and that these guys are working really hard to be able to feed their families too. I could feel their pain. It's hard work being in sales.I think anyone in the market for a vehicle, new or used, should check this out. People can only take advantage of you if you let them, and not all car salesman or dealerships are bad. I say shame on the car buyers for not doing their homework beforehand. And if your credit is bad, don't expect to get a low payment on your new car. Either prepare to pay a large down payment or make large monthly payments. Or consider a used vehicle for crying out loud! Half the customers that showed up for the sale in this documentary looked like they couldn't even afford a new pair of shoelaces! Research the cars you're interested in...the internet makes this astonishinly easy. Figure out what you can afford. Determine your credit standing. And live within your means.And a special note to the Slasher himself, if you ever read this, boy do you have a tough job. But not once did we see you say anything rude to any of those customers and I applaud you for that. I would've lost my mind dealing with people like that. You had such a high energy level the entire time, all the while you were probably thinking of your family to survive those 3 sale days. It's also nice to put a face with a name. I just imagined some poor shmoe from the sales department being forced to walk around in some sort of mascot suit in the hot, hot sun. I guess it doesn't help being in a tux though does it?In conclusion, this being by far the longest review I've written, I really do think that most people would be able to take something very valuable away by watching this documentary. To the salespeople on the lots: watch this now! Get it and have your entire dealership watch it together. It will give you a new perspective on your business which is never a bad thing. To the car buyers everywhere: you only get taken advantage of because you don't research what you're buying. This isn't a $10 t-shirt at the mall. This is a large purchase. You wouldn't just buy a new TV without checking if it has the S video input and all that other junk (reminds me...I need a new TV). You compare the brands and see who has the best quality with the features you want at a price that is most reasonable to you. That's what you should be doing when you buy a car.  If you go into a dealership knowing as much as you can about the vehicle you wish to purchase particularly regarding prices and vehicle features, you will be better able to negotiate a deal that makes you and the dealership happy without, pardon the expression, taking it up the a**. I highly, highly, highly recommend this documentary.",5,I write car ads for people like this!,1138838400,"02 2, 2006",2006,4277,"['course', 'not', 'clients', 'agency', 'are', 'wacked', 'out', 'actually', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', '88', 'car', 'usually', 'run', '88', 'down', '88', 'month', 'clients', 'have', 'cars', 'as', 'low', '995', 'lot', 'What', 'love', 'Slasher', 'kinds', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'not', 'laughing', 'customers', 'showed', 'up', 'lot', 'Folks', 'write', 'ads', 'living', 'can', 'tell', 'someone', 'advertising', 'cars', 'as', 'low', '88', 'just', 'one', 'lot', 'can', 'tell', '99', '%', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'caught', 'dead', 'car.Ah', '1', '%', 'would', 'Anyone', 'will', 'get', 'kick', 'customers', 'coming', '88', 'car', ""'m"", 'sure', 'clients', 'would', 'split', 'sides', 'laughing', 'perhaps', 'crying', 'too', 'know', 'hard', 'move', 'units', ""'m"", 'responsible', 'developing', 'new', 'creative', 'help', 'guys', 'sell', 'more', 'Sales', 'will', 'surely', 'bring', 'Slasher', 'run', 'advertorials', 'quite', 'frequently', 'clients', 'who', 'have', 'used', 'Slasher', 'others', 'imitations', 'must', 'call', 'different', 'name', 'order', 'clients', 'not', 'run', 'legal', 'problems', 'it.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'only', 'automotive', 'industry', 'people', 'should', 'see', 'happened', 'stumble', 'reading', 'other', 'documentaries', 'one', 'was', 'recommended', 'laughed', 'had', 'find', 'One', 'assistants', 'saw', 'was', 'coming', 'IFC', 'taped', 'team', 'see', 'could', 'gain', 'new', 'perspective', 'gained', 'perspective', 'not', 'clients', 'are', 'crooks', 'guys', 'are', 'working', 'really', 'hard', 'be', 'able', 'feed', 'families', 'too', 'could', 'feel', 'pain', 'hard', 'work', 'being', 'sales.I', 'think', 'anyone', 'market', 'vehicle', 'new', 'used', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'People', 'can', 'only', 'take', 'advantage', 'let', 'not', 'car', 'salesman', 'dealerships', 'are', 'bad', 'say', 'shame', 'car', 'buyers', 'not', 'doing', 'homework', 'beforehand', 'credit', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'get', 'low', 'payment', 'new', 'car', 'prepare', 'pay', 'large', 'down', 'payment', 'make', 'large', 'monthly', 'payments', 'consider', 'used', 'vehicle', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'customers', 'showed', 'up', 'sale', 'documentary', 'looked', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'afford', 'new', 'pair', 'shoelaces', 'Research', 'cars', ""'re"", 'interested', 'internet', 'astonishinly', 'easy', 'Figure', 'out', 'what', 'can', 'afford', 'Determine', 'credit', 'standing', 'live', 'means.And', 'special', 'note', 'Slasher', 'ever', 'read', 'boy', 'do', 'have', 'tough', 'job', 'not', 'once', 'did', 'see', 'say', 'anything', 'rude', 'customers', 'applaud', 'would', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'mind', 'dealing', 'people', 'had', 'high', 'energy', 'level', 'entire', 'time', 'while', 'were', 'probably', 'thinking', 'family', 'survive', '3', 'sale', 'days', 'also', 'nice', 'put', 'face', 'name', 'just', 'imagined', 'poor', 'shmoe', 'sales', 'department', 'being', 'forced', 'walk', 'sort', 'mascot', 'suit', 'hot', 'hot', 'sun', 'guess', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'tux', 'though', 'conclusion', 'being', 'far', 'longest', 'review', ""'ve"", 'written', 'really', 'do', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'something', 'very', 'valuable', 'away', 'watching', 'documentary', 'salespeople', 'lots', 'watch', 'now', 'Get', 'have', 'entire', 'dealership', 'watch', 'together', 'will', 'give', 'new', 'perspective', 'business', 'never', 'bad', 'thing', 'car', 'buyers', 'everywhere', 'only', 'get', 'taken', 'advantage', 'do', ""n't"", 'research', 'what', ""'re"", 'buying', ""n't"", '10', 't-shirt', 'mall', 'large', 'purchase', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'buy', 'new', 'TV', 'checking', 'S', 'video', 'input', 'other', 'junk', 'need', 'new', 'TV', 'compare', 'brands', 'see', 'who', 'best', 'quality', 'features', 'want', 'price', 'most', 'reasonable', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'when', 'buy', 'car', 'go', 'dealership', 'knowing', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'vehicle', 'wish', 'purchase', 'particularly', 'regarding', 'prices', 'vehicle', 'features', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'able', 'negotiate', 'deal', 'dealership', 'happy', 'pardon', 'expression', 'taking', 'a**', 'highly', 'highly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'documentary']",Slasher
