385547,A1OKSBT276EBMX,6303816339,"Corgilover ""corgi lover""","[6, 6]","I am lucky enough to own the original release. Gilda Radner's Norma Desmond witch is simply wonderful. This was released in 1978 in a period when people were less uptight and less strangled by political correctness...thank goodness. If you're afraid that your sensitive little darling might be tainted by the look of a seductive cartoon vampiress then they probably shouldn't be celebrating this pagan holiday anyway. It has a wonderful wholesome message that all of us go about out lives in the same old way day after day, and for one night we can be whoever and whatever we want to be. Let the kids watch it I'm sure they will survive and be better for it! I have shown this wonderful gem to family and neighbors for twenty-six years and it is the best sort of halloween tradition.",5,Best Halloween Story Ever.,1130630400,"10 30, 2005",2005,783,"['am', 'lucky', 'enough', 'own', 'original', 'release', 'Gilda', 'Radner', 'Norma', 'Desmond', 'witch', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'was', 'released', '1978', 'period', 'when', 'people', 'were', 'less', 'uptight', 'less', 'strangled', 'political', 'correctness', 'thank', 'goodness', ""'re"", 'afraid', 'sensitive', 'little', 'darling', 'might', 'be', 'tainted', 'look', 'seductive', 'cartoon', 'vampiress', 'then', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'celebrating', 'pagan', 'holiday', 'anyway', 'wonderful', 'wholesome', 'message', 'go', 'out', 'lives', 'same', 'old', 'way', 'day', 'day', 'one', 'night', 'can', 'be', 'whoever', 'want', 'be', 'Let', 'kids', 'watch', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'survive', 'be', 'better', 'have', 'shown', 'wonderful', 'gem', 'family', 'neighbors', 'twenty-six', 'years', 'best', 'sort', 'halloween', 'tradition']",Witch's Night Out VHS
385548,AM09DDTX577CH,6303816339,C. Pencil,"[5, 5]","This is one of the best Halloween animated pieces of all time. It is very clever and extremely funny. This is not just for children, it is just as much for adults. It's one of my family's favorites, right up there with the Great Pumpkin. It is intelligent and original in it's themes and style.  Gilda Radner's performance as the witch is priceless. She holds nothing back in her hilarious portrayal.  The animated expressions and reactions on the witch's face are pure genius. The music and theme song is brilliant as well.This animated special deserves a quality DVD release.  Hopefully it will one day get the attention it deserves.",5,Hilarious and Brilliant,1066867200,"10 23, 2003",2003,635,"['one', 'best', 'Halloween', 'animated', 'pieces', 'time', 'very', 'clever', 'extremely', 'funny', 'not', 'just', 'children', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'adults', 'one', 'family', 'favorites', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'Great', 'Pumpkin', 'intelligent', 'original', 'themes', 'style', 'Gilda', 'Radner', 'performance', 'witch', 'priceless', 'nothing', 'back', 'hilarious', 'portrayal', 'animated', 'expressions', 'reactions', 'witch', 'face', 'are', 'pure', 'genius', 'music', 'theme', 'song', 'brilliant', 'well.This', 'animated', 'special', 'quality', 'DVD', 'release', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'get', 'attention']",Witch's Night Out VHS

However, the producers of this video elected to sell it in SLP rather than SP, probably to save a few pennies.

So you can tell that it made a strong initial impression on me.  The animation is  basic in the extreme, but the backgrounds are quite nice and the character  design of the witch is excellent--some of her facial expressions are  extremely amusing.  (She rather puts me in mind of Gloria Swanson in  &quot;Sunset Boulevard.&quot;)  The script is very funny--I think adults  can enjoy it just as much as children.  Great for watching around  Halloween!  The only drawback to this tape is that it's recorded in EP, the  slowest VHS speed, so the video quality isn't as good as it could be.",5,A lot of fun for the whole family,940377600,"10 20, 1999",1999,719,"['just', 'watched', 'video', 'first', 'time', 'good', 'many', 'years', 'found', 'remembered', 'almost', 'line', 'dialogue', 'can', 'tell', 'made', 'strong', 'initial', 'impression', 'animation', 'basic', 'extreme', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'quite', 'nice', 'character', 'design', 'witch', 'excellent', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'extremely', 'amusing', 'rather', 'mind', 'Gloria', 'Swanson', 'quot', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard.', 'quot', 'script', 'very', 'funny', 'think', 'adults', 'can', 'enjoy', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'children', 'Great', 'watching', 'around', 'Halloween', 'only', 'drawback', 'tape', 'recorded', 'EP', 'slowest', 'VHS', 'speed', 'video', 'quality', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'could', 'be']",Witch's Night Out VHS
385552,A22KLENTB0NA0P,6303816339,Pamela Beam,"[0, 0]","I didn't get to see this one very often when I was a kid, but I loved it when I did get the chance.  Back in '02 I looked it up in my library's catalog and reserved it.  My kids loved it, as well.  I always wanted a copy of my own, but when I would look it up on other sites, it was way out of my price range.  Then I tried Amazon.  :D  I'm so glad I did.The plot concerns Small and Tender, a brother and sister who only want to scare people for Halloween.  When all they do is hear how cute they are, they give up.  While hanging out with their babysitter Bazooie (I think I'm spelling that right), they cry out that they wish they could be a real ghost (Tender) and a real wolfman (Small), what they dressed as for Halloween.  A witch hears their plaintive cries and flies over to their house.  From there, merriment and mistaken identity ensue.  Even Bazooie gets into the act.Your kids will love this one.  And if you grew up during the seventies as I had, you might enjoy it, too.As for the physical quality of this VHS tape, the case was beaten up, but the tape itself was in perfect condition.  Some people might not think the price is a good one, but it sure is when you compare how much other sites want for it.",5,A GREAT CHILDHOOD MEMORY,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,1220,"['did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'one', 'very', 'often', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'loved', 'when', 'did', 'get', 'chance', 'Back', ""'02"", 'looked', 'up', 'library', 'catalog', 'reserved', 'My', 'kids', 'loved', 'as', 'well', 'always', 'wanted', 'copy', 'own', 'when', 'would', 'look', 'up', 'other', 'sites', 'was', 'way', 'price', 'range', 'Then', 'tried', 'Amazon', 'D', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did.The', 'plot', 'concerns', 'Small', 'Tender', 'brother', 'sister', 'who', 'only', 'want', 'scare', 'people', 'Halloween', 'When', 'do', 'hear', 'how', 'cute', 'are', 'give', 'up', 'hanging', 'out', 'babysitter', 'Bazooie', 'think', ""'m"", 'spelling', 'right', 'cry', 'out', 'wish', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'ghost', 'Tender', 'real', 'wolfman', 'Small', 'what', 'dressed', 'Halloween', 'A', 'witch', 'plaintive', 'cries', 'flies', 'house', 'there', 'merriment', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'ensue', 'Even', 'Bazooie', 'act.Your', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'one', 'grew', 'up', 'seventies', 'had', 'might', 'enjoy', 'physical', 'quality', 'VHS', 'tape', 'case', 'was', 'beaten', 'up', 'tape', 'was', 'perfect', 'condition', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'think', 'price', 'good', 'one', 'sure', 'when', 'compare', 'how', 'much', 'other', 'sites', 'want']",Witch's Night Out VHS
