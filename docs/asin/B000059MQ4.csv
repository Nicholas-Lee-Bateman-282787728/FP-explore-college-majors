I love both Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow and it's a shame that a movie with reasonable potential could be so bad. The characters are un-interesting and the plot is overly predictable to the point of annoying.

573612,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000059MQ4,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I know that I kind of shouldn't, but I kind of like this movie.  Granted, I haven't seen it in some time, but my memories of it are fond.  I can admit that not a lot about this movie makes sense outside of movie-world-make-believe, but the packaging is well wrapped and what is inside has enough going for it to make it forgivable even if it isn't believable.That's called good acting.The film follows a selfish and arrogant (albeit successful) ad exec that trades places with a beat down family man venturing home.  I don't mean they `trade places', I mean that they literally `trade places'.  Wanting to stay behind and get some tail, Buddy (our self centered executive) lets Greg (our family man) have his seat on the next flight back home.  When that said plane crashes and Greg dies, Buddy goes a little crazy.  What happens next is a tad odd yet strangely understandable.  Buddy, after going in and then getting out of rehab, decides to place himself inside Greg's widow's life.  He feels so guilty for Greg's death that he wants to shred away his selfishness and do something right, although his actions could be considered selfish as well (a theme I really wish had a little more depth here).Here's why I understand despite the fact that it essentially doesn't make sense.  Having met Greg, heard his story and had that personal connection to him, I can see why Buddy feels responsible.  He had a face to go with the name.  His actions (giving Greg the ticket) were selfish (if he didn't want the tail he would have never given Greg the ticket) and so he wanted to find some peace.  That said, if he had gotten on the plane he would have died at the hands of his own selfishness anyways, so it's a tad lose-lose here.At the heart of this preposterous yet surprisingly touching film is a gloriously tapered performance by the beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow.  With a complete understanding of her character (inside and out), Paltrow delivers the type of performance that elevates an entire film.  While the character itself is rather clich&eacute;d (grieving widow) there is a lot that can be done with this character in order to make it breathe, and Gwyneth does that.  Sadly, the ending of the film kind of disregards Abby's credibility, but that's how things go with films of this nature.  Ben Affleck is also rather well suited for this film.  He plays arrogance well, and shockingly he also plays conflicted and tormented well.  We all know he is a charming leading man so he kind of nails every layer of Buddy (even if the layers don't all make sense).In the end, it is the films sentimental charm that makes it a must see.  Like I've mentioned, there are a lot of things here that shouldn't work, but for some reason they all do.  I'd watch this film again and again and enjoy it every time.",4,A completely likable implausibility...,1274140800,"05 18, 2010",2010,2799,"['know', 'kind', 'should', ""n't"", 'kind', 'movie', 'Granted', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'time', 'memories', 'are', 'fond', 'can', 'admit', 'not', 'lot', 'movie', 'sense', 'movie-world-make-believe', 'packaging', 'well', 'wrapped', 'what', 'inside', 'enough', 'going', 'make', 'forgivable', 'even', ""n't"", 'believable.That', 'called', 'good', 'acting.The', 'film', 'selfish', 'arrogant', 'successful', 'ad', 'exec', 'places', 'beat', 'down', 'family', 'man', 'venturing', 'home', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'trade', 'places', 'mean', 'literally', 'trade', 'places', 'Wanting', 'stay', 'behind', 'get', 'tail', 'Buddy', 'self', 'centered', 'executive', 'Greg', 'family', 'man', 'have', 'seat', 'next', 'flight', 'back', 'home', 'When', 'said', 'plane', 'crashes', 'Greg', 'dies', 'Buddy', 'little', 'crazy', 'What', 'next', 'tad', 'odd', 'yet', 'strangely', 'understandable', 'Buddy', 'going', 'then', 'getting', 'rehab', 'place', 'Greg', 'widow', 'life', 'so', 'guilty', 'Greg', 'death', 'shred', 'away', 'selfishness', 'do', 'something', 'right', 'actions', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'selfish', 'as', 'well', 'theme', 'really', 'wish', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'depth', 'here', 'why', 'understand', 'fact', 'essentially', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Having', 'met', 'Greg', 'heard', 'story', 'had', 'personal', 'connection', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Buddy', 'responsible', 'had', 'face', 'go', 'name', 'actions', 'giving', 'Greg', 'ticket', 'were', 'selfish', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'tail', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'given', 'Greg', 'ticket', 'so', 'wanted', 'find', 'peace', 'said', 'had', 'gotten', 'plane', 'would', 'have', 'died', 'hands', 'own', 'selfishness', 'anyways', 'tad', 'lose-lose', 'here.At', 'heart', 'preposterous', 'yet', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'film', 'gloriously', 'tapered', 'performance', 'beautiful', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'complete', 'understanding', 'character', 'Paltrow', 'type', 'performance', 'entire', 'film', 'character', 'rather', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'grieving', 'widow', 'lot', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'character', 'order', 'make', 'breathe', 'Gwyneth', 'Sadly', 'ending', 'film', 'kind', 'disregards', 'Abby', 'credibility', 'how', 'things', 'go', 'films', 'nature', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'also', 'rather', 'well', 'suited', 'film', 'arrogance', 'well', 'shockingly', 'also', 'conflicted', 'tormented', 'well', 'know', 'charming', 'leading', 'man', 'kind', 'nails', 'layer', 'Buddy', 'even', 'layers', 'do', ""n't"", 'all', 'make', 'sense', 'end', 'films', 'sentimental', 'charm', 'must', 'see', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'here', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'reason', 'do', ""'d"", 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'again', 'enjoy', 'time']",Bounce

573614,A9XYVIKIN0IMK,B000059MQ4,"aurileo ""aurileo""","[8, 12]","On a very basic level, this movie is just...wrong.  ""Bounce"" has interesting characters and ideas floating around in it, but this is one of those movies whose plot would be over with in about fifteen minutes if the characters just behaved with some common sense and reacted appropriately to the given situations. Instead we get a script by Don Roos which tries to manufacture drama where there is none.  The setup for the relationship between Ben Affleck's Buddy and Gwyneth Paltrow's Abby is somewhat involved, but intriguing: Buddy gives his plane ticket to a stranger named Greg, so Greg can get home a little earlier to his family for Christmas and Buddy can stay in Chicago with his lovely new acquaintance Mimi and her overnight room voucher. The next morning Buddy is horrified to learn that the plane crashed and Greg, who was in Buddy's intended seat, was killed.  Buddy's survivor guilt makes sense, but his subsequent alcoholism and rehab are never given the weight they should have been given in the story - when was the last time you saw a movie character's descent into alcoholism depicted by a few shots of that character holding a glass? And in a completely ludicrous plot development, the script also has the airline company employing Buddy's ad firm to design a series of spots which actually CALL ATTENTION to the crash. Reality check, please!!!When he decides to visit Greg's widow (Abby) a year later, to make amends as part of his 12 step program, Buddy doesn't tell her who he is, and this for me doesn't wash: there is no reason for him not to tell her, and the characters could still have entered into a romance from a different (and more interesting) perspective.  But instead they're playing ""I've Got A Secret"".  Abby later overreacts melodramatically when she learns about Buddy's connection to Greg's death, because he LIED to her.  Of course she lied too - she first tells Buddy she's divorced, and when she later owns up to being a widow, the reason she gives for lying is pretty lame.  The keeping-secrets aspect of the plot is illogical - these people are looking for closure of some sort, after all - and it makes the movie seem very formulaic and contrived. There was a good story to be had with these characters, but sadly Don Roos never found it.  If he had spent more time showing us the intervening year after the crash, from both characters' POV's, and then let Buddy and Abby cut to the emotional chase when they finally do meet, the movie would have had more of an interesting and substantial arc - instead it's obviously been designed primarily to keep Affleck and Paltrow onscreen together as much as possible.A little relief from them would have been a nice thing.  This is born out by the DVD edition's disc two, which contains deleted scenes fleshing out some of the supporting characters and clarifying some of the plot - it also includes two alternate endings, both of which are better than the one finally chosen for the theatrical release.  I'm not sure whether Roos or Miramax made the cutting room decisions, but the deleted scenes contain much better dialogue than a lot of the scenes that did make it into the final cut.  This is partially because almost all the scenes involve Affleck or Paltrow talking with supporting characters, rather than to each other - the movie really suffers by the exclusion of these scenes, and it was almost a mistake for Miramax to include them on the disk, since they left this viewer thinking ""there was a much better movie here and they blew it!""  The supporting characters are played by great actors who are edited down or essentially wasted. Joe Morton, Jennifer Grey (whose character really deserved more screen time), Natasha Henstridge, Caroline Aaron, and David Paymer all do well with the bones they're thrown.  Tony Goldwyn does make a very likeable impression as Greg, and Johnny Galecki is a real standout as Buddy's assistant Seth, who is also a member of AA: the deleted scenes involving this character reinforce how exceptionally good Galecki is in the role, but they also confirm that Roos had no idea how to use him in the film.  The subject of AA is brought up several times: It would have been cool to see Buddy confronting some of his demons at a meeting, but although this carrot is waved at the audience, we never do get it -- the whole AA angle is just another plot device, as is the airline lawsuit trial, which could really have provided a jolt of dramatic interest if it had been handled better.As for the stars' performances: well I've never been a Ben Affleck fan, but he actually gives this a valiant effort and has some good moments - if he's not totally convincing in his more emotional scenes, it's at least partially due to the weak writing.  Paltrow is excellent, fighting the easy cliche of her role and bringing lots of original shadings to it.  She's also much better than Affleck at transcending the clunky dialogue - both of their characters are given stuff to say that I can't imagine anyone in this situation in real life actually saying.Roos does contribute some nice directorial touches: the plane crash, for instance, is handled in a refreshingly minimalist way, as is the bedroom scene between the leads - it really plays as a love scene for the characters, rather than as a voyeuristic opportunity for the audience.  On the technical side, the movie is beautifully shot, as was Roos' previous ""The Opposite Of Sex"" - I'm not sure if it's the same cinematographer, but whatever else you say about the movie, ""Bounce"" looks great. The melancholy sound track is unoriginal and bland, with the occasional dreary alternative-folk-rock song thrown in for good measure.  Dreary is a good word to describe this flick - it's very earnest, and very dreary.  It's hard to categorize it in one or two words (which is not necessarily a bad thing) - ""Bounce"" is certainly not a romantic comedy, but calling it a drama only belies how basically UN-dramatic it is.  I know a lot of people really like this movie, but if you haven't seen it, rent it first to make sure you're one of them, before you buy it.",2,Earnest and dreary,1097884800,"10 16,

573615,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000059MQ4,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Probably the biggest problem with Bounce is that the first 40 minutes of film are very very boring.The part where Ben's character meets the people at the airport, and the entire storyline that focused on his business and the meetings... this was downright horrible.  Usually such scenes serve as nice, innocent filler which leads to the main point of the story- but in this movies case, this was filler that felt even more pointless than usual.In fact, the pacing of this movie is quite bad too.  Not only does nothing really interesting happen leading up to the airplane accident, but you're constantly wondering if the writers even knew which way they wanted to approach the introduction and build-up to the main plot.For the first 40 minutes, every mildly interesting scene would lead straight into an unnecessary one.  VERY awkwardly paced movie this one is for the first half.The second half -when Ben's character eventually makes contact with the widow- is when the storyline picks up a LOT more.  The nerve of Ben's character though, to actually get into a relationship with the woman after she lost her husband in an airplane accident.  Oh you don't think that's bad?  Get THIS-Ben's character switched planes with the same guy at the airport that was married to the widow, so Ben's character was supposed to be on the airplane that went down.  Ben's character went to contact the widow to do the right thing and explain what happened because switching plane tickets with the guy that died was something that was seriously bothering him... but instead he falls in love with the guys wife!  Insane.Interesting how the introduction of the widows children didn't even enter the picture until much later.  I thought this was a good idea and a nice break from the typical ""child hates mom or dads girlfriend/boyfriend"" storyline that's so popular in many other dramas that eventually becomes a focal point later on.  None of that here.It WAS quite offensive to me that Ben's character would mock the people who died in airplane accidents.  Maybe he wasn't necessarily mocking the people- just the presentation and the memories people would share with those they recently lost, Ben's character would find a way to make fun of it in one scene early on.  Surely had this movie been released after 9/11, a scene like this wouldn't have made it into the final version.I don't know- it's a good movie, but not a great one.",3,3 stars sound about right,1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,2419,"['Probably', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Bounce', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'boring.The', 'part', 'where', 'Ben', 'character', 'people', 'airport', 'entire', 'storyline', 'focused', 'business', 'meetings', 'was', 'downright', 'horrible', 'Usually', 'such', 'scenes', 'serve', 'nice', 'innocent', 'filler', 'main', 'point', 'story-', 'movies', 'case', 'was', 'filler', 'felt', 'even', 'more', 'pointless', 'usual.In', 'fact', 'pacing', 'movie', 'quite', 'bad', 'too', 'Not', 'only', 'nothing', 'really', 'interesting', 'happen', 'leading', 'up', 'airplane', 'accident', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'wondering', 'writers', 'even', 'knew', 'way', 'wanted', 'approach', 'introduction', 'build-up', 'main', 'plot.For', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'scene', 'would', 'lead', 'straight', 'unnecessary', 'one', 'VERY', 'awkwardly', 'paced', 'movie', 'one', 'first', 'half.The', 'second', 'half', '-when', 'Ben', 'character', 'eventually', 'contact', 'widow-', 'when', 'storyline', 'up', 'LOT', 'more', 'nerve', 'Ben', 'character', 'actually', 'get', 'relationship', 'woman', 'lost', 'husband', 'airplane', 'accident', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'bad', 'Get', 'THIS-Ben', 'character', 'switched', 'planes', 'same', 'guy', 'airport', 'was', 'married', 'widow', 'Ben', 'character', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'airplane', 'went', 'down', 'Ben', 'character', 'went', 'contact', 'widow', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'switching', 'plane', 'tickets', 'guy', 'died', 'was', 'something', 'was', 'seriously', 'bothering', 'instead', 'love', 'guys', 'wife', 'Insane.Interesting', 'how', 'introduction', 'widows', 'children', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'enter', 'picture', 'much', 'later', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'nice', 'break', 'typical', 'child', 'mom', 'dads', 'girlfriend/boyfriend', 'storyline', 'so', 'popular', 'many', 'other', 'dramas', 'eventually', 'focal', 'point', 'later', 'None', 'here.It', 'WAS', 'quite', 'offensive', 'Ben', 'character', 'would', 'mock', 'people', 'who', 'died', 'airplane', 'accidents', 'Maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mocking', 'people-', 'just', 'presentation', 'memories', 'people', 'would', 'share', 'recently', 'lost', 'Ben', 'character', 'would', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'fun', 'one', 'scene', 'early', 'Surely', 'had', 'movie', 'been', 'released', '9/11', 'scene', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'final', 'version.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know-', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'one']",Bounce
573616,AJOR7D8TIH3R4,B000059MQ4,bert1761,"[4, 7]","I originally had no intention of ever seeing this movie.  The previews never looked interesting, and I find Ben Affleck shallow and arrogant.  (The one aspect of the viewing experience that was not disappointing was that Ben Affleck lived up (down?) to my expectations.)  But then I realized that &quot;Bounce&quot; was written and directed by Don Roos, who wrote and directed one of the best films of 1998 -- &quot;The Opposite of Sex.&quot;  Consequently, I came to expect a somewhat offbeat movie infused with depth AND wit.  Instead, we get the standard-issue, banal boy-meets-girl, boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl, etc... movie.No further comment needs to be made about Ben Affleck -- except that he/his character is SO obnoxious at the beginning of the movie that the one-night-stand (with the radiant Natasha Henstridge) that sets up the plot seems highly improbable.  Gwyneth Paltrow tries very hard to create another of her intelligent, graceful characters, but is ultimately doomed to failure because there is nothing she can do to elevate her character above the mediocrity of the film.  (Or perhaps she flounders because she can't even believe her character is in love with Ben Affleck's because she can't believe she was ever in love with him.)

As the blurb on the DVD case said, this was a romantic movie with great chemistry between the two co-stars, I expected to see a cute movie about two beautiful people falling in love. but I was pleasantly suprised by the depth of the movie.The basic plotline is this:  Ben Affleck plays a vibrant, young man with a promising career named Buddy who gives up his plane ticket to a man he meets at the airport for a night with a beautiful blond.  As fate would have it, the plane has a deadly crash killing all the passengers on board including Buddy's acquaintance.  To make up for the guilt, Buddy seeks out the widow of this acquaintance, played by Gwyneth Paltrow.  Although, Buddy's intentions were merely to help the family and disappear, in the midst of his guilt, he sees past the grief and falls in love with this beautiful woman.I believe the script, the directing, and the acting were all very successful in this film.  Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck were very believable and the gradual growth in their relationship was very real.  Gwyneth's performance was quite amazing.  Peronally this is one of my favorite performances by her.  She allows Abby to be vulnerable and emotional yet her strength and virtues are consistent throughout the movie.  The credit goes to both Gwyneth and the write/director, Don Roos for this.

The biggest reason is that I've only seen Ben Affleck in one movie where I liked his acting, &quot;Good Will Hunting.&quot;  He surprised me in this movie by doing a very good acting job and holding his own with Gwyneth Paltrow, his romantic lead.  The gist of the story is easy to follow. Affleck plays Buddy Amaral, a successful ad executive with substance abuse and commitment problems to anything but getting ahead.  He gives his airline ticket to another passenger when he sees the opportunity to have a one night stand by staying on the ground in Chicago where a snow storm is ongoing.  The plane crashes and the other guy dies instead of Buddy.  Unable to handle the guilt from this situation, he eventually seeks out the dead man's widow and starts to help her in business without telling her who he is.  The romantic complications flow from this basic setup. Affleck and Paltrow are very good as a couple together, which maybe was helped by their being a real life couple for a time during and after the movie. The costuming, makeup and hair designers must have knocked themselves out trying to make Paltrow as plain as possible.  I almost didn't recognize her when she came onscreen.  I think her plainness  was a bit overdone.  Hubby even liked this movie despite his usually avoiding this type of movie.  He even went so far as to say he thought Affleck was terrific.

He's the writer of the 5 star Boys On the Side, and writer/director of the oddly warm-hearted (for a film supposedly meant to be cynical) The Opposite Of Sex. And Bounce feels like Mr Roos continuing his restless search for whatever it is that he really, really, wants to say.Bounce is a - well, it's hard to say. Tragedy? Rom com? Rehab drama? It has all these elements, and the genre switches as you change focus. Follow the Gwyneth Paltrow character and you could be watching a Sandra Bullock produced woman-getting-back-out-there film. Follow the Ben Affleck character and it's like Gus Van Sant was given a budget. Follow Paltrow's kids and its a drama about fathers. Follow the airline and it's a courtroom drama.Perhaps it should have been a trilogy. I don't know.But even though it doesn't have the world's strongest throughline, or indeed a consistent tone, there is a great deal to like. Gwyneth does grief - and it's necessary hesitation at getting back 'out there' on the dating scene - very well. The kids are good. Johnny Galecki steals all the scenes he is in, as Affleck's ex-alcoholic gay assistant. And there is very strong support in relatively tiny roles - Natasha Henstridge as an unblousy one night stand and Jennifer Grey as an ex are both good. I confess the appeal of Affleck largely passes me by, but he is passable in this.At the end of the film, and for a few days after, I found myself wondering what Don Roos intended, and whether he felt it had worked.

Director Dan Roos never had a chance to salvage this project.  The screen writing is far below par, and the story line borders on the absurd.  Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow probably agreed to do this film because of its challenging roles.  There are admittedly a wide range of emotions required to portray two lovers brought together by unusual and tragic circumstances.  Buddy Amaral (Ben Affleck) means well when giving his ticket to another guy anxious to get home in time for Christmas, but has no way of knowing that the plane is doomed to crash.  Buddy responds by abusing alcohol and soon is unable to function as a top advertising agent.  Normal people simply do not respond in this manner. A sense of moral guilt is not rational in this particular situation.Buddy eventually searches for the victim's wife to see if he can aid her in some way.  Alas, Abby Janello (Gwyneth Paltrow) is floundering as a widow with two children to support.  She earns money as a business real estate agent, but comes across as someone totally unqualified for the job.  Buddy essentially hands Abby a lucrative sale on a silver platter.  One thing leads to another, and they fall in love with each other.  Buddy has yet to tell her about his inadvertent role in her husband's death.  The dialogue is verbose, tiring, and utterly incomprehensible.  Even amateur film makers rarely fail to this degree.  I spent the whole time wondering why a major movie studio gave its approval.  It would seem to me that the danger signs should have been blatantly obvious.It is extremely rare for me to award a film with such talented actors only one star.

573629,A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8,B000059MQ4,Desmond Chan,"[5, 6]","BOUNCE, directed by Don Roos (The Opposite of Sex), marks a surprising turn to romance and even for the poignant take on surviving the pain of losing your beloved ones to fate. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Abby, who grapples with the agony of losing her husband Greg to a fateful aircrash. Never she expected that her husband had exchanged plane tickets with Buddy (played by Ben Affleck) who wanted a one-night stand with a newfound attraction Mimi (Natasha Henstridge). The romance aside, BOUNCE delves deeply into the characters' psyche - the isolation of Abby and how she saves a woman from her embarrassment with the toilet roll; Buddy recovering from guilt to bounce back with courage and direction to steer clear of his aimless life as a advertising executive.Among the cast, Paltrow shines luminously. She portrays Abby with grief and angst and her vulnerability is conveyed with her fragile frame. Affleck still needs polishing in his expression though. The bittersweet romance is tinged with genuine sadness and forgiveness and their chemistry is bolstered, perhaps from real life to reel life.BOUNCE is a movie that is more laudable for its honest and unpretentious take on demise and departure; its romance element is secondary. Finely acted by Paltrow, it is a movie that is worth your time even though some parts may be a little slow-moving.",4,A poignant take on bouncing from LIFE's Disappointments,986428800,"04 5, 2001",2001,1348,"['BOUNCE', 'directed', 'Don', 'Roos', 'Opposite', 'Sex', 'surprising', 'turn', 'romance', 'even', 'poignant', 'take', 'surviving', 'pain', 'losing', 'beloved', 'ones', 'fate', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Abby', 'who', 'agony', 'losing', 'husband', 'Greg', 'fateful', 'aircrash', 'Never', 'expected', 'husband', 'had', 'exchanged', 'plane', 'tickets', 'Buddy', 'played', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'who', 'wanted', 'one-night', 'stand', 'newfound', 'attraction', 'Mimi', 'Natasha', 'Henstridge', 'romance', 'aside', 'BOUNCE', 'deeply', 'characters', 'psyche', 'isolation', 'Abby', 'how', 'woman', 'embarrassment', 'toilet', 'roll', 'Buddy', 'recovering', 'guilt', 'bounce', 'back', 'courage', 'direction', 'steer', 'clear', 'aimless', 'life', 'advertising', 'cast', 'Paltrow', 'luminously', 'Abby', 'grief', 'angst', 'vulnerability', 'conveyed', 'fragile', 'frame', 'Affleck', 'still', 'polishing', 'expression', 'bittersweet', 'romance', 'tinged', 'genuine', 'sadness', 'forgiveness', 'chemistry', 'bolstered', 'perhaps', 'real', 'life', 'reel', 'life.BOUNCE', 'movie', 'more', 'laudable', 'honest', 'unpretentious', 'take', 'demise', 'departure', 'romance', 'element', 'secondary', 'Finely', 'acted', 'Paltrow', 'movie', 'time', 'even', 'parts', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'slow-moving']",Bounce
573630,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B000059MQ4,D. Litton,"[0, 0]","You can enjoy &quot;Bounce&quot; as a by-the-numbers romance that goes through the motions of most other films of the genre, but that doesn't stop it from appearing cliched. The story of man-meets-woman (at least it's not boy-meets-girl) comes from an interesting twist in the beginning, but it all seems to paint itself into a corner without really breaking any new ground in the second two thirds. The performances from the two leads, as well as some of the supporting cast, make the movie worth watching, but the story really doesn't shine as much as it should.That interesting twist comes in the beginning of the movie. Buddy Amaral is a successful ad executive who has just won over the campaign for Infinity Airlines, on which he is about to fly to Los Angeles. His flight is delayed because of inclimate weather, and soon he is chatting in the bar with Greg Janello, who is traveling back to L.A. to his family. When he discovers he has bumped from the flight, Janello phones his family to let them know he is taking a later flight, but Buddy gives him his ticket and tells him to get on the plane.The twist occurs when Buddy learns that the plane crashed in flight, killing everyone aboard, and his guilt over the death of Janello leads him down a path of alcoholism and depression, from which he later recovers in A.A. After a year of getting back on his feet, he decides to pay a visit to Janello's wife, Abby, whom Janello had mentioned in their conversation along with his two small boys. As it turns out, Abby is a real-estate agent who is able to get Buddy's ad firm a nice piece of property, thereby causing them to become better acquainted with one another, and eventually falling in love.It all looks and sounds good, but this is where the movie takes its originality and turns it into formula. What couple in any relationship doesn't go through some sort of hardship? None, but the hardships of this film are just a bit played out by now. We know that Buddy wants to come clean with Abby about knowing her deceased husband, and the movie's predictability lets us know that, even before it happens, she is going to reject him for not telling her. I'm not going to completely give away the ending of this movie for you, so I'll put it into not-so-certain terms: if you can guess what is going to happen scene-by-scene, then you're probably correct about your predictions.Which is what really hinders this movie's potential as an original romance: it starts out originally and then settles for a second half that follows the same pattern as any other romance you'll see. They meet each other, play the game of shy looks and modesty with one another, soon become enamored with one another, and then meet hardship which they may or may not overcome. That hardship plays out like more of a script inclusion than something convincing. It comes off looking like Abby has to separate from Buddy, instead of like a decision that her character makes based on her experiences. The movie never gives any breathing room for its characters: they never appear to be making their own decisions, but ones that are made for them.The chemistry between Buddy and Abby is mediocre at best, with a tug-of-war between believability and plot requirement taking them down different paths in their relationship. Ben Affleck, who plays Buddy, is convincing as being both arrogant and emotional in his role, at different times, of course. Abby is played by Gwyneth Paltrow, who nicely puts her fashionable looks aside and is able to play the part of a grieving widow with a convincing demeanor. The chemistry between these two acting talents is there, but the same cannot be said for their characters due to the aforementioned story pitfalls which keep us from fully liking the characters.&quot;Bounce&quot; gathers up momentum, but never takes off. The characters of the movie hve so many places to go, but the story keeps them trapped in a web of contrivance and formula. The plot needs work in its second half, as does the way it treats the actors.

The plane crashes and Buddy is wracked with guilt, wanting to make amends to Greg's family.  Upon meeting Greg's wife Abby (Gwyneth Paltrow), he falls in love with her, but keeps the switch a secret.  To no one's surprise, the secret comes out and Abby doesn't take it well.  This is standard romantic fare, boy meets girl; they fall madly in love and seem perfect for one another; a big blowup drives a wedge between them; he tries to win her back.The plot uses a variation on the device used in ""Random Hearts"" where Harrison Ford's wife dies in a plane crash and he seeks out the wife of the man she was sitting next to, ultimately falling in love with her.  Though somewhat contrived, it is an interesting device, however the two films arrived on the market too closely in time for it to be a coincidence.This film tries to do too much.  Writer/Director Don Roos (The Opposite of Sex) doesn't seem quite sure whether this is a serious drama or a lighthearted romantic comedy and he keeps flitting back and forth incongruously.  Buddy is an alcoholic with intimacy problems, a cavalier attitude and a gigantic guilt complex.  He is far too flawed to be believable in this relationship and Ben Affleck's devil-may-care demeanor on screen is a mismatch for the tortured soul he is portraying.  Roos has trouble keeping the film on course making unnecessary plot digressions that bog the film down in spots.Gwyneth Paltrow is terrific in the romantic scenes, but she is overly melodramatic in the serious scenes.  Oddly, although Affleck and Paltrow dated for a while, they don't seem to have very good chemistry onscreen (perhaps that's why they broke up).The DVD has a second disk devoted to special features, but much of that is taken up by a series of dreadfully bad impromptu interviews by Affleck and Paltrow with members of the production crew (like best boy, boom operator, hair stylist, etc.).This is a fair story with good actors who are cast poorly, and a director who meanders too much.

However, I was pleasantly surprised with the film and the perfromances within.Ben Affleck is a successful ad agency salesman and partner. A storm during the Christmas season has many of the commuters at the Chicago airport stranded. Affleck has a ticket on the last flight to leave for L.A. before the weather gets worse, he gives it up to a fellow traveler.  The plane goes down and Affleck has to deal with the guilt, eventually leading him to alcohol.  A year later he looks up the widow of the man to whom he gave the ticket. He helps her out with her business dealings and then plans to fade away, but a relationship ensues and the rest is an emotional roller coaster with the underlying secret.First, Affleck is exceptional in this role. I have never been a great fan of his acting abilities but he is strong and moving as Buddy. He convincingly shows his character's weaknesses and guilt. Paltrow is as always solid as a berieved widow cautiously wading into a new relationship.  And although the actor's name escapes me, the character of Affleck's assistant adds necessary humor and sarcasm. (He was the boyfriend of the youngest Connor girl on the T.V. show Roseanne).Despite the fact that the previews for this film gave you the entire plot, the movie still holds interest throughout.

I guess you could say it's a Romance movie, the one thing I generally try to avoid, I loved this.  Affleck certainly is a great actor, this is one great acting job, just below &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; and &quot;the part he was born to play&quot; in &quot;Boiler Room&quot;.One thing I liked so much in this movie is the storyline.  It's not a bull-$h!t story like most romance movies, it's actually got a good story that might actually happen as opposed to the crappy romance stories about horses and bridges in madison county.  The start of the movie is very good.  It starts off with Buddy(Affleck) and he's in an airport where he meets a &quot;Foxy&quot; blonde who fits perfectly into the one-night stand category.  Along the way he meets a struggling play-write who joins them at a bar when their plane gets cancelled.  After a few drinks, the three get talking, and Buddy takes out his video camera(the Sony DCR-PC100, which I have) and gets him and Greg, the play writer.  When Greg tells Buddy his story about his family back home, and missing the holidays, Buddy gives him his ticket to another plane so he can be with his family.  Buddy not only sees this as an act of kindness, but rather an easy way for that one night stand.  So, off Greg goes, and Buddy takes his &quot;lady&quot; to the airport hotel... In the middle of the night, Buddy wakes up to loud sirens, and turns on the T.V. ...And the plane HE was supposed to be on crashed, and took all the passengers with it.  Buddy goes into a slump, and becomes an alcholic after this mess, and when he eventually gets out of rehab, he goes to check up on Greg's wife... Abby.  They get to talking, and he decides she should handle his company's office-hunting.  The two find they have a lot in common, and Buddy not only falls in love with her, but her kids as well.  Then one day, Abby gets a video(think Blonde, and video-camera).  Guess what's on the tape?  You got it.  Buddy and Greg.  The news crushes Abby, but she doesn't know what to think... have Greg and Buddy never have met, and have Buddy(a stranger to Abby) die, and never being able to meet and fall in love with Abby, or have it turn out the way it did...Although just by watching, you can tell that a significant amount of footage was cut-out, it's still a well-rounded movie with good acting to boot.  If your looking for a good date movie, or feeling miserable about your own love life, this is definitely one to check out.

573642,A2HRT3AZA2YCDP,B000059MQ4,James E Geoffrey II,"[1, 2]","In Mirimax Picture's 'Bounce,' an admittedly extraordinary circumstance becomes the catalyst for a story about ordinary people living ordinary lives and being all the more extraordinary for that. Far from being yet another 'chick-flick' romance, 'Bounce' is a movie that explores how guilt and love and friendship and kindness and dishonesty and fear can all intertwine and how average people respond to the randomness of life and chance. It is, in short, an outstanding movie that is refreshingly free of the cliches that normally burden romances of this type.The story revolves around Buddy Amaral (Ben Affleck), a jet setting ad executive who, in order to get a one night stand with fellow passenger Mimi Praeger (Natasha Henstridge), gives his airplane ticket to Greg Janello, a TV writer and failed playwrite who is anxious to get home to his wife, Abby (Gweneth Paltro) and sons Joey and Scott, played by David Dorfmann and Alex Linz. When the plane on which Buddy was supposed to fly subsequently crashes, killing all including Greg, Buddy is overwhelmed with guilt and descends into alcoholism. After spending time in rehab, Buddy decides that he must make amends to Greg's family and arranges for Abby, now working as a struggling real estate agent, to sell Buddy's advertising agency new offices. Buddy and Abby fall in love, but he cannot bring himself to tell her the truth. At that point, Mimi has a chance meeting with Abby who discovers Buddy's secret.Notwithstanding a somewhat contrived situation, 'Bounce' succeeds because its characters are multidimensional and very human. Buddy and Abby are attractive people because they are real people that the audience wants to get to know. Buddy is a hot shot at the start of the movie, but he is also vulnerable and lonely and desperate to be liked. Abbey is the grieving widow, but she is also an attentive mother, a suburban housewife and a working woman who has to support two young children but is not sure, even a year after her husband's death, that she can do it. What is more, both are wracked by guilt caused by a situation that they could not predict or control, but that has radically changed their lives.Make no mistake, Abby and Buddy are not the traditional Hollywood romantic movie heroes. These are not characters who start out flawed and whose romance redeems them from their sins. Rather, both of these characters are striving to overcome their flaws. Not in the typical 'run away to find yourself' soul searching Hollywood way, but rather in the little every day ways of their growing love.This is powerful stuff because screenwriter/director Don Roos has avoided the snappy dialogue and corny speeches that make most Hollywood romantic characters seem inauthentic. Rather, Roos makes them human and therefore sympathetic. When Abby fails to understand a joke that Buddy makes, the audience can laugh with her because they've been the ones who have missed the joke. When Buddy struggles to tell his secret, the audience can sympathize with his struggle because they have sometimes had trouble telling the truth.As for the acting, Paltrow puts in an absolutely riveting performance. She deftly avoids the cliche of the happy widow or the tough mom. She makes Abby a totally believable character whose pain is real to the audience, but whose understated courage calls for admiration. In this movie, Paltrow masters a character that could easily have become a one dimensional caricature, but instead takes on real flesh and blood characteristics.Typically, Ben Affleck's performance does not get quite the rave reviews that his co-star and former real life girlfriend gets. However, this is unfair. For while Paltrow avoids the pitfall of making her character into a cliche, Affleck has the harder job because his character's motivations are less straightforward. Buddy vulnerabilities are harder to define, harder to see and his guilt is more complex than Abby's. For where she feels guilty because her last words to her husband were made in hasty argument, Buddy's guilt is strictly speaking unwarranted. He did a man a favor and random chance saved Buddy's life. Yet Buddy's guilt is real, and is perhaps more rooted in the emptiness he feels in his life and in his sense that the frivolousness of his actions were repaid in tragedy for another.Affleck conveys this brilliantly and in subtle ways. When a flight attendant spurns Buddy's advances, he looks both amused and baffled and genuinely hurt. When Abby mentions Greg's name after having just clinched the real estate deal that Buddy threw her way, Buddy looks hurt and disappointed in spite of himself. When Abby finally confronts Buddy about his secret, the pain is palpable but restrained. He tears up, his voice cracks as he says good bye and asks for forgiveness, but he does not gush or create the emotional scene that is normally requisite in a Hollywood romance. This is emotionally complex stuff and Affleck deserves credit for what is surely the best performance of his entire career.As to the rest of the cast, their work is stupendous. Johnny Galecki as Seth, Buddy's gay assistant, is brilliant, more than compensating for the fact that his character is a sort of glorified Jimminy Cricket. Tony Goldwyn is instantly likeable as Greg, as is Natasha Henstridge as Mimi. David Dorfman and Alex Linz are also quite good as Abby's sons. One only wishes that there had been more time to develop the relationship between Buddy and the boys. Fortunately, what the audience does see is both believable and touching.'Bounce' is emotionally compelling without bludgeoning its audience. Although there are a few plot contrivances that do not quite ring true, this is more than compensated for by characters that are real, sympathetic and engaging. At the start of the film Buddy asks, 'Am I that much of a cliche?' No he is not, and that is what makes 'Bounce' such a moving and human story.",5,Romance without the Cliches,1012435200,"01 31, 2002",2002,5928,"['Mirimax', 'Picture', ""'Bounce"", 'admittedly',

573643,A6HD47UMW7F6Y,B000059MQ4,James Schoonmaker,"[5, 8]","There's not much to recommend this movie.  There's no real chemistry between Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow, which is a shame because they're both talented actors, and they've both proven they can do romance.  They just don't do it here.  In fact, there's so little connection it's obvious they're just reading scripted lines.  In the end, it's neither their fault, nor the writers: the lines are all right, and they're read well, but there's just no chemistry.There are only two major failures with this movie, but they're doozies: the characters and the plot concept.  The characters fail to grow on viewers despite all the standard awkward situations they're put into to create sympathy.  Affleck's guilt over Paltrow's husband seems contrived, rather than genuine or understandable.  He is a sterotypical villain, ready, even eager, to prey on others.  Even his career is sterotypical: he an ad exec; of course he's a horrible human being.  His character fails: a flat-character bad guy that almost, but not quite, becomes a likeable guy.  His guilt and self-loathing seem contrived.  Paltrow's character fails as well: you sometimes feel sorry for her, but never really sympathize.The other major failure is the plot twist.  The only redeeming factor is the that-could-have-been-me factor, which is given away in the trailers and not developed in the movie.  If they had spent more time developing his character around that, and not forcing him to persue Paltrow's character, this movie might have been saved.  Instead, they use it as a cheap plot device, and throw it away.There's not even anything to qualify it as a decent chick-flick- there's nothing to sigh about at the end, you never say ""just say yes, you twit!  Can't you see he loves you?"".

The two leads suffer through unpleasant situations that can not lead to a happy solution as they are written. For some unexplained reason, the Ben Affleck character never comes right out and tells the Gweneth Paltrow character that he switched plane tickets with her husband on the ill fated flight. It is a fatal flaw. A viewer would think that after having gone through a year of therapy, he could face what had happened. Instead, the script is padded with silly evasions and outfight lies. The leads are very attractive with obvious chemistry that could have produced a wonderful romantic film, but it never happens.One of the major faults with the DVD package is that the director and the cast promise in voice over narrations to show a number of deleted scenes on the DVD plus three alternate endings, but they are NOT included. Since there is is second disk just for the bonus materials, these omissions could not be because of lack of disk space. This is a really unfortunate situation.

So, disc 1, the video transfer is as usual a very nice clean effort from Beauna Vista/Miramax, presented in Anamorphic Widescreen at 1.85:1, the original theatre format.Sound is good and clear, a mainly dialogue driven film , but a few surround moments in airports etc help to fill where required.Audio commentary with Don Roos(Director)&amp;Bob Cohen(Prod), kinda dry and lifeless, technical aspects as well as acting choices, and basic plot structure are the focus. Disc 2...OK..now u get 8 scenes from the movie with commentary by Ben,Gwen &amp; Don, this is more entertaining thanks to Bens sense of humour.Gag reel(5.30mins) standard fluffed lines etc,Deleted scenes (14)totaling 45 mins with or without Comm, presented in original form non anamorphic, most dumped during extensive test audience reviews, some would have changed the ultimate feel of the film. 2 features, one a Making of..type doco(22mins) one a more relaxed behind the scenes with Ben &amp; Gwen(22mins).

The ending doesn't provide much suspense--the only real question is when Gwyneth is going to find out what happened.  To the filmmakers' credit, the scene is later than would be expected, which allows some tension to build.The major problem with this movie is that Ben Affleck never quite musters the dramatic intensity that is required of him in a few scenes.

Failed playwright, Greg Gennello, played by Tony Goldwyn, is happily married and has a rich family life. Their worlds collide when they meet in an airport and get to talking. Both headed to the same destination, Greg wants to get home to his family but is bumped from his flight, while Buddy wants to miss that very same flight so that he can have a one night stand with a beautiful fellow traveler.In a moment of wild abandon, Buddy gives his ticket to Greg who then boards the plane in his stead. Unfortunately, this act of seeming generosity by Buddy has dire consequences, as the plane crashes and Greg is killed. When Buddy later discovers this turn of events, it is a moment of reckoning for him, and he goes into a personal downward spiral.A year later, after a stint in rehab to get his drinking under control, he seeks out Greg's widow, Abby, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. Still feeling guilty over Greg's death, Buddy seeks redemption by doing something nice for Greg's widow, who, as the single parent of two young boys, is now trying to make ends meet as a real estate agent. He gives her a sizable real estate commission to handle, though she is unqualified, and soon they begin dating and fall in love. At this juncture, Buddy has still not told her that their meeting was not kismet.To make a long story short, Abby discovers, in a rather unpleasant way, the part that Buddy played in Greg having been on that fatal flight. The movie then goes south. What had started out promisingly enough, takes a strange twist.

573660,A152C8GYY25HAH,B000059MQ4,Matthew Horner,"[0, 0]","Romantic comedies and dramas are still the kinds of movies girls tend to drag guys to, although I suspect the guys enjoy them more than they let on. I know my Dad and his buddies did. They never admitted they did, but it wasn't that hard to persuade them to go and they always seemed to be in a good mood afterwards. I've always liked them, because the best ones take us to a special place where Cinderellas and Prince Charmings are everywhere and where the worst disagreements are quickly and happily resolved.Sadly, Bounce is not an especially good romantic film, which is too bad because it is likable enough. The problem is in the plot structure. It is utterly predictable, one of those stories where you know exactly how it will end thirty minutes into the picture.Ben Affleck plays Buddy, an amiable guy whose small California advertising agency has just won a major account with Infinity Airlines. We find Ben in a Chicago airport hoping that his plane will depart before a big snowstorm halts all the flights. Waiting in an airport bar, he meets two other Californians. One is a beautiful woman, and the other is a man named Greg, who is eager to get home to his wife and two kids. The three talk until Buddy's flight departure is announced. It's the last flight out. He almost goes, but then decides to spend the night with the woman. He gives his ticket to Greg, who boards the plane in his place. The flight never arrives. Instead, it crashes, killing everyone on board. Months later, Buddy, who has been plagued with guilt, decides to look up Greg's widow, Abby [Gwyneth Paltrow]. He simply want to see if she needs anything. You can probably guess where the story goes from there.Affleck and Paltrow work well together, and why not? They used to be an item in real life. Paltrow has no problem with her role, which requires her to lose her glamour queen image. She is completely believable as a struggling young widow. Affleck is pleasant to watch, but he has trouble with his two or three big emotional scenes. I think he is more comfortable when he isn't playing the nice guy. Alex B. Linz and David Dorfman do good jobs playing Abby's two small sons. Johnny Galecki has the best small part. He plays Buddy's wisecracking, no nonsense gay assistant. He's very funny and, by far, the wisest character in the movie.Director Don Roos, who has done splendid work on ironic comedies such as The Opposite of Sex, seems a bit lost dealing with such a mainstream story, which ironically he also wrote. As a result, Bounce makes for a pleasant diversion, the kind you more or less enjoy and then promptly forget.",3,Formula romance is pleasant diversion,1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2002,2618,"['Romantic', 'comedies', 'dramas', 'are', 'still', 'kinds', 'movies', 'girls', 'tend', 'drag', 'guys', 'suspect', 'guys', 'enjoy', 'more', 'let', 'know', 'Dad', 'buddies', 'did', 'never', 'admitted', 'did', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'hard', 'persuade', 'go', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'good', 'mood', 'afterwards', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'best', 'ones', 'take', 'special', 'place', 'where', 'Cinderellas', 'Prince', 'Charmings', 'are', 'everywhere', 'where', 'worst', 'disagreements', 'are', 'quickly', 'happily', 'resolved.Sadly', 'Bounce', 'not', 'especially', 'good', 'romantic', 'film', 'too', 'bad', 'likable', 'enough', 'problem', 'plot', 'structure', 'utterly', 'predictable', 'one', 'stories', 'where', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'picture.Ben', 'Affleck', 'Buddy', 'amiable', 'guy', 'small', 'California', 'advertising', 'agency', 'just', 'won', 'major', 'account', 'Infinity', 'Airlines', 'find', 'Ben', 'Chicago', 'airport', 'hoping', 'plane', 'will', 'depart', 'big', 'snowstorm', 'halts', 'flights', 'Waiting', 'airport', 'bar', 'two', 'other', 'Californians', 'One', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'other', 'man', 'named', 'Greg', 'who', 'eager', 'get', 'home', 'wife', 'two', 'kids', 'three', 'talk', 'Buddy', 'flight', 'departure', 'announced', 'last', 'flight', 'out', 'almost', 'then', 'spend', 'night', 'woman', 'ticket', 'Greg', 'who', 'boards', 'plane', 'place', 'flight', 'never', 'Instead', 'killing', 'everyone', 'board', 'Months', 'later', 'Buddy', 'who', 'been', 'plagued', 'guilt', 'look', 'up', 'Greg', 'widow', 'Abby', '[', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', ']', 'simply', 'want', 'see', 'anything', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'where', 'story', 'there.Affleck', 'Paltrow', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'why', 'not', 'used', 'be', 'item', 'real', 'life', 'Paltrow', 'problem', 'role', 'lose', 'glamour', 'queen', 'image', 'completely', 'believable', 'struggling', 'young', 'widow', 'Affleck', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'trouble', 'two', 'three', 'big', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'think', 'more', 'comfortable', 'when', ""n't"", 'playing', 'nice', 'guy', 'Alex', 'B.', 'Linz', 'David', 'Dorfman', 'do', 'good', 'jobs', 'playing', 'Abby', 'two', 'small', 'sons', 'Johnny', 'Galecki', 'best', 'small', 'part', 'Buddy', 'wisecracking', 'nonsense', 'gay', 'assistant', 'very', 'funny', 'far', 'wisest', 'character', 'movie.Director', 'Don', 'Roos', 'who', 'done', 'splendid', 'work', 'ironic', 'comedies', 'such', 'Opposite', 'Sex', 'bit', 'lost', 'dealing', 'mainstream', 'story', 'ironically', 'also', 'wrote', 'result', 'Bounce', 'pleasant', 'diversion', 'kind', 'more', 'less', 'enjoy', 'then', 'promptly', 'forget']",Bounce

Didn't work for these two, J-Lo & Benny, Tom & Nicole, I could go on, but I won't. (There probably are many more) This movie probably wouldn't have caught my eye before, except I got it for dead cheap - ?1.20. Plus, it's got two discs to watch - albeit, not terrific extras, but still, cheap is cheap!As well as Ben & Gwyn, this has a great supporting cast, well, apart from Alex D. Linz, who is as big a brat in this as he is in Home Alone 22. The rest of the supporting cast are great: a strange looking Jennifer Grey, Joe Morton, the 'bad' guy from Ghost, and probably many other faces that I don't recognise, but you will. I felt Jennifer Grey's role kinda got pushed to one side, even though it was an important storyline.When the film started, it came across as very much a Final Destination storyline. With the plane and everything. To be honest, the film kinda dragged in the scenes between the plane crashing, and Ben meeting Gwyn. (By the way, who calls their child BUDDY?!)As with all rom-coms, this was very predictable - it just took a while for Benny to get round to telling Gwynnie that he knew her now deceased hubby. You keep rooting for him to tell her, knowing exactly what her reaction was gonna be.I didn't think Ben & Gwyn were exactly miscast in this movie - but it didn't last between them. And how BAD was her wig/hair extentions at times? I thought my hair was bad for looking like a birds nest half the time - I've now seen the light.The DVD has your usual batch of extras here: commentary, making-of, deleted Footage with commentary, gag reel (normally, the only worthwhile one for me to watch), &quot;Need to Be Next to You&quot; music video, featurette: Ben and Gwyneth Go Behind the Scenes, and additional scene-specific commentary with director Don Roos and actors Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow.

While it starts out well enough (it begins so well that I decided to take a break from writing reviews on here), it somehow made me begin to lose interest after the first 40 minutes. The final half-hour was especially hard to sit through. I think that it's because of director Don Roos's lack of a cohesive narrative style. In the end, it just seems that the whole idea of this movie was to get Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow (who were famous for their on-again-off-again romance in real life) back together on the big screen. (...)The crucial scene where Buddy (Affleck) and Abby (Paltrow) first meet is done so awkwardly: he arrives at her place of business, stands back to watch her take her Rottweiler out of the car to go inside her office, then approaches the front door and knocks, she comes out to greet him as a potential client, he interests her with a business offer, the dog who's locked in the bathroom barks loudly, she apologizes for that, he then makes a comment about Rottweilers, she freaks out because she hadn't mentioned that she had a Rottweiler (although the volume of the barking alone would've given that fact away), so now she things he's a stalker and as he tries to explain that he's not, she threatens to sic the dog after him, then accidentally opens the bathroom door a bit too much, the Rott then burts out and attacks him, tearing his suit-jacket and dress pants, after which he threatens to sue her till she apologizes profusely, and then they both spend the rest of the day talking outside the tailor's with the dog, who by now for some reason is totally docile.  This isn't a Meet Cute: it's a Meet Ridiculous!So many similar opportunities for intelligent dialogue are missed throughout the movie. I'm not going to go into any further detail, as other reviewers have already done so, but I just wanted to express my disappoinment with the results of a system that greenlights sensationalism over substance.  Anybody who seriously thinks that this film would have been made without Ben & Gwyneth is seriously fooling themselves!Ben Affleck has already proven himself to be a very good, natural actor (especially in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE and GOOD WILL HUNTING) and Gwyneth Paltrow is nothing short of the Meryl Streep of her generation--but let's hope that if they ever co-headline another movie, they both carefully read the script first, as well as make sure they work with a director with more than a one-film resume` to his credit.",2,Disappointing Movie,1007510400,"12 5, 2001",2001,2497,"['just', 'saw', 'BOUNCE', 'cable', 'out', 'well', 'enough', 'so', 'well', 'decided', 'take', 'break', 'writing', 'reviews', 'here', 'somehow', 'made', 'begin', 'lose', 'interest', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'final', 'half-hour', 'was', 'especially', 'hard', 'sit', 'think', 'director', 'Don', 'Roos', 'lack', 'cohesive', 'narrative', 'style', 'end', 'just', 'whole', 'idea', 'movie', 'was', 'get', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'who', 'were', 'famous', 'on-again-off-again', 'romance', 'real', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'big', 'screen', 'crucial', 'scene', 'where', 'Buddy', 'Affleck', 'Abby', 'Paltrow', 'first', 'meet', 'done', 'so', 'awkwardly', 'place', 'business', 'back', 'watch', 'take', 'Rottweiler', 'car', 'go', 'office', 'then', 'front', 'door', 'knocks', 'out', 'greet', 'potential', 'client', 'interests', 'business', 'offer', 'dog', 'who', 'locked', 'bathroom', 'loudly', 'then', 'comment', 'Rottweilers', 'out', 'had', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'had', 'Rottweiler', 'volume', 'barking', 'alone', 'would', ""'ve"", 'given', 'fact', 'away', 'so', 'now', 'things', 'stalker', 'explain', 'not', 'sic', 'dog', 'then', 'accidentally', 'bathroom', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Rott', 'then', 'out', 'attacks', 'tearing', 'suit-jacket', 'dress', 'pants', 'sue', 'till', 'profusely', 'then', 'spend', 'rest', 'day', 'talking', 'tailor', 'dog', 'who', 'now', 'reason', 'totally', 'docile', ""n't"", 'Meet', 'Cute', 'Meet', 'Ridiculous', 'So', 'many', 'similar', 'opportunities', 'intelligent', 'dialogue', 'are', 'missed', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'further', 'detail', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'so', 'just', 'wanted', 'express', 'disappoinment', 'results', 'system', 'greenlights', 'sensationalism', 'substance', 'Anybody', 'who', 'seriously', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Ben', 'Gwyneth', 'seriously', 'fooling', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'already', 'proven', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'natural', 'actor', 'especially', 'SHAKESPEARE', 'IN', 'LOVE', 'GOOD', 'WILL', 'HUNTING', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'nothing', 'short', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'generation', 'let', 'hope', 'ever', 'co-headline', 'movie', 'carefully', 'read', 'script', 'first', 'as', 'well', 'make', 'sure', 'work', 'director', 'more', 'one-film', 'resume', 'credit']",Bounce
573671,A1BRXLFWILNICE,B000059MQ4,Robin McDonald,"[0, 1]","Chalk up some of my disappointment to thinking this movie might have a healthy dose of lighthearted humor and romance and a sense of playfulness about the rematching of this former real life pairing. Still Bounce simply was dull and I am kind of stunned that this film failed to piece together an engaging bond. All the tension in the story rests on Ben Afflecks character looking for the right moment to reveal his secret. Part of the problem is its not even a very good secret. Neither is the secret a deal breaker so the waiting for the shoe to drop loses most all of its interest after the first hour and twenty minutes. This delay has the cumulative effect of making Affleck seem increasingly unworthy of Gwyneth Paltrow's sweet vulnerable character that you sort of wish he would realize he isn't good enough to be with her and go home. Eventually I was worn out and simply wanted him to get it over with so the movie would end. The film reminds me of a Reds Dodgers game I attended. There was no score til the bottom of the ninth inning, two men out two strikes, two balls and one man who walked to first base. Finally the reds make a hit! The first baseman makes it home, the batter was tagged out and the game suddenly ended. Bounce is a little like that. Too little payoff after a very long wait for something to happen. I am even being generous because the game was really exciting at that last moment. Bounce was merely predictable. Its really a shame because when you have two well matched slices of tasty bread, all you need is a little filler in the middle to make a really good sandwich.

573673,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000059MQ4,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 6]","&#65533;Bounce&#65533; is an utterly winning romantic drama, replete with an intriguing storyline, believable characters and honest emotions.Ben Affleck stars as Buddy Amaral, an arrogant hotshot advertising exec, who, in a rare moment of kindness, offers his seat on an airplane to a young writer desperate to get home to his wife and kids for the holidays.  When the man dies in a plane crash, Buddy is suddenly sent on a mission of soul-searching, trying to sort out the complex emotions he is now forced to deal with.  When drinking provides no solution, he feels himself compelled to seek out the man&#65533;s widow, Abby, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, and their two young boys.  Buddy keeps his connection with them a secret as he begins to fall in love with Abby and to become a part of their wounded family.In its bare-boned detailing, the plot may smack a bit of incredibility and contrivance.  But thanks to expert writing and directing by Don Ross, every detail in the film feels just right.  Take the opening scene, for instance.  Ross gives the chance encounter between the two strangers who will be forever tied together by fate the loose, casual, and offhanded quality one finds in real life.  Nothing in this film ever seems forced, least of all the romantic feelings these two hurt, vulnerable and attractive people feel for one another.  In fact, it is the complexity of the characters that helps &#65533;Bounce&#65533; to rise above the superficiality of most films in this genre.  In addition to Buddy&#65533;s character-building, we see Abby trying desperately to overcome the bewildering tragedy that has befallen her, unsure of how to deal with her own feelings of loss, guilt and anger that inevitable arise from such a situation.Affleck and Paltrow bring such an air of thoughtfulness and maturity to their roles that we find ourselves genuinely caught up in their predicament and rooting them on all the way.  It&#65533;s nice for a change to see a romantic film truly centered on a pair of likable grownups as opposed to the superannuated adolescents we usually find in films of this type.  Here are flawed, often weak, individuals who nevertheless contain cores of genuine goodness and innate warmheartedness.The movie also achieves additional depth and weight in its exploration of the vagaries of fate as many of the characters examine the &#65533;what if&#65533; scenarios that haunt anyone caught up in a situation like this one.&#65533;Bounce&#65533; is well written, directed and acted.

573679,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B000059MQ4,S. Schell,"[1, 2]","Poor, poor Ben and Gwyneth - was this ever the WRONG project for both of them.  Don't get me wrong, ""Bounce"" can be entertaining at times, especially for people who are suckers for romantic flicks with a hint of sadness (e.g. ""Message In A Bottle"" style).  For all its beautiful faces and feel-good romance, ""Bounce"" is incredibly flawed and collectively marks a low point on both Affleck's and Paltrow's career.The nucleic flaw of this film is its malnourished plot.  The sob story begins with a guy named Buddy Amaral (Affleck), a pompous advertising exec with a penchant for mid-day doses of hard liquor.  His yen for the drink becomes worse one fateful day when, waiting for a delayed flight at the Chicago O'Hare airport, he hands off his plane ticket scheduled for an earlier escape to a poor schmoe named Greg Janello (Goldwyn).  The fated aircraft crashes and the impact kills nearly all of its passengers, including Janello himself.  Buddy is guilt-ridden and thinking himself responsible for Greg's ill-fated death, submits himself to a torturous alcohol binge.  It isn't long before his addiction starts to hinder his fast-paced career and, after his problem becomes crudely apparent to his co-workers, he enters a local and well-reputed detox center.Fast forward a year later and we see that Buddy is being released from the clinic, now healthy as a horse.  He goes home to start making calls asking forgiveness (part of his rehabilitation, those who are familiar with AA will know what this is) and decides to look up Greg's family.  Finding his last known address, he makes a flight out to Greg's home and for the first time sees Greg's wife Abby (Paltrow) and their two sons.  Apprehensive about revealing the reason for his arrival, Buddy nonchalantly introduces himself and observes how Abby has gotten along without her husband in the past year.  As can be predicted, he soon falls in love with her and she with him, the pressure of revealing his secret continuing to build.  Once the truth finally does come out (and not at his behest), we are left with the obvious questions, such as ""Will she forgive him?"" and ""Will they stay together?""  This is the typical romantic drama with the inevitable letdown, never answering any of these questions and giving us a cliffhanger ending which leaves room to speculate the unseen outcome.The script is another major flaw, smothering itself with far too much romanticism that it fails to deliver a solid message or theme.  I was left rolling my eyes during many scenes because of the overindulgence in sentimentality.Ben Affleck is one of my favorite male actors nowadays, but I was disappointed with his finished product for this flick.  This is not to say I didn't enjoy watching him at all - hell, I had fun just watching him smile that gorgeous smile and make dreamy eyes at his co-star.  His character, however, is somewhat misconstrued and underdeveloped.  He seems like a good guy but then again he's supposed to be a tortured soul.  Affleck plays him as a light-hearted chum with a little too much on his mind when, in accordance with the script, there should've been calamitous emotion beneath Buddy's handsome exterior.  Another thing that cannot be explained or ignored is this: in a particular scene where Buddy's character is bordering on tears, Ben's efforts look unbelievably forced and it's painful to watch this come from such a prominent leading man. Why?Paltrow is an excellent actress and portrays her character admirably, but her efforts seem wasted here.  She often gives too much of herself to such a limited character, reaching a point where she begins to OVERACT.  Maybe if her skillful melodrama had conveniently rubbed off on Affleck, their roles as Abby and Buddy might've been more balanced and appraisable.Aside from their lackluster performances, my foremost thought while watching Affleck was, ""Take your clothes off!""  Even when I got my wish, there wasn't much to see.  The frame was so tight on Paltrow and Affleck's upper torsos (not to mention crude close-ups of their faces) that it lacked any excitement - there was no sexiness to their sex.  In fact, their whole on-screen relationship was completely devoid of any sexual chemistry, even though Affleck and Paltrow dated exclusively while this movie was being made.  It makes no sense and neither does the camerawork in this particular scene.  What can I say?  With a man as beautiful as Affleck, I'm very disappointed that I didn't get to see more of him!  Maybe I should watch ""Reindeer Games"" instead...On the whole, ""Bounce"" is at first promising and then fails to deliver the goods.  Fellow romantics, direct yourselves towards emotive fare such as ""The Whole Wide World"" (Renee Zellweger, Vincent D'Onofrio), ""Mansfield Park"" (Frances O'Connor, Alessandro Nivola, Jonny Lee

The expansive 2-disc format gives viewers really much more information than its mediocre subject deserves.  Indeed, all that bonus material just gives mounting evidence that there was nothing at any stage of the development of this project that was really intriguing.  I'd like to think that the film was somehow shortchanged by the studio's advertising department, or that there was some explanation for a concept film that's all concept and no character.  But given the huge amount of materials on the DVD, it's fairly easy to say that once you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie.Worse, the trailer oversells the movie.  It has some scenes which were blatantly cut from the final print, and tends to feature the comic side of the movie far too strongly.  The movie doesn't even really deliver on its trailer's subtextual selling point: the on-screen reunion of real-life exes.  Instead, Paltrow and Affleck's characters spend less time falling in love and more time agonizing about the secrets they're hiding from each other.  Too bad for these fine actors that it's hard for an audience to stay interested in two hours worth of guilt.  Inexplicably, one starts the movie basically to watch on-screen chemistry of off-screen lovers, only to end the movie not caring about them OR their characters.  Somehow, they're just not FUN together, and that's what we hope they will be.  If you want a better film about airplane tragedy guilt, see RANDOM HEARTS.  If you want a better film about either Affleck or Paltrow falling in love, pick almost any other movie they've made.What might possess you to buy this DVD are those extra features.  There's more here than on most other films to help you judge the worth of the project in full.  Deleted scenes, outtakes, and a behind-the-scenes featurette await.  But maybe the most useful bit is an enlightening set of crew interviews, conducted mostly by Affleck and Paltrow.  You'll find out a lot about what different people do on the set of a film, from gaffers to production assistants.  Teachers, particularly, might want to buy this film for this particular feature.  Equally, fans of Affleck and Paltrow will like to see how easily the actors get along with their crew.  It's also one of the few filmed moments that sheds light onto how one makes a career behind the camera as a best boy or sound engineer.",3,Not too much spring in this BOUNCE,988243200,"04 26, 2001",2001,2409,"['BOUNCE', 'DVD', 'too', 'good', 'film', 'expansive', '2-disc', 'format', 'viewers', 'really', 'much', 'more', 'information', 'mediocre', 'subject', 'deserves', 'Indeed', 'material', 'just', 'mounting', 'evidence', 'was', 'nothing', 'stage', 'development', 'project', 'was', 'really', 'intriguing', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'somehow', 'shortchanged', 'studio', 'advertising', 'department', 'was', 'explanation', 'concept', 'film', 'concept', 'character', 'given', 'huge', 'amount', 'materials', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'easy', 'say', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailer', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie.Worse', 'trailer', 'movie', 'scenes', 'were', 'blatantly', 'cut', 'final', 'print', 'feature', 'comic', 'side', 'movie', 'far', 'too', 'strongly', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'deliver', 'trailer', 'subtextual', 'selling', 'point', 'on-screen', 'reunion', 'real-life', 'exes', 'Instead', 'Paltrow', 'Affleck', 'characters', 'spend', 'less', 'time', 'falling', 'love', 'more', 'time', 'agonizing', 'secrets', ""'re"", 'hiding', 'other', 'Too', 'bad', 'fine', 'actors', 'hard', 'audience', 'stay', 'interested', 'two', 'hours', 'guilt', 'Inexplicably', 'one', 'movie', 'basically', 'watch', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'off-screen', 'lovers', 'only', 'end', 'movie', 'not', 'caring', 'OR', 'characters', 'Somehow', ""'re"", 'just', 'not', 'FUN', 'together', 'what', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'want', 'better', 'film', 'airplane', 'tragedy', 'guilt', 'see', 'RANDOM', 'HEARTS', 'want', 'better', 'film', 'Affleck', 'Paltrow', 'falling', 'love', 'pick', 'almost', 'other', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'made.What', 'might', 'possess', 'buy', 'DVD', 'are', 'extra', 'features', 'more', 'here', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'help', 'judge', 'worth', 'project', 'full', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'await', 'maybe', 'most', 'useful', 'bit', 'enlightening', 'set', 'crew', 'interviews', 'conducted', 'mostly', 'Affleck', 'Paltrow', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'lot', 'what', 'different', 'people', 'do', 'set', 'film', 'gaffers', 'production', 'assistants', 'Teachers', 'particularly', 'might', 'want', 'buy', 'film', 'particular', 'feature', 'Equally', 'fans', 'Affleck', 'Paltrow', 'will', 'like', 'see', 'how', 'easily', 'actors', 'get', 'crew', 'also', 'one', 'few', 'filmed', 'moments', 'sheds', 'light', 'how', 'one', 'career', 'camera', 'best', 'boy', 'sound', 'engineer']",Bounce
