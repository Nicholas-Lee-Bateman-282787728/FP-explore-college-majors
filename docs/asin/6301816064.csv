There is no choreographer in the world that could make Baryshnikov look bad.That said, I didn't like this version of Carmen. Carmen?  What's with the chairs?  Petit makes Barysnikov's part look more like Escamillo's than Don Jose's.And I did not like Zizi Jeanmaire at all.  For one thing she looks older than ""Don Jose"" and overly eager, rather than disdainfully seductive. But I don't think that's the main problem.

270550,A3TIL1PC2ZE97B,6301816064,J. M WILINSKY,"[12, 12]","There are several versions of Carmen ballets on DVD, and they are all interesting in their own ways.  This newer version choreographed by Ted Brandsen for the West Australian Ballet is one of my favorites.  First of all, the dancing is absolutely fantastic!  The principals, as well as the supporting cast, are very impressive.  Carmen is danced by Benazir Hussain, and her portrayal is masterfully convincing and seductive, and quite a sight in her bright red shift.  All the women wear shifts in bright colors, dance on pointe, and the men wear drab, simple pants and button down shirts.  The men are supposed to be soldiers in some army and the women are in the neighborhood.  This is one of the most straightforward Carmen ballets.  It is also one of the most romantic, as you can see by the cover.  The men pursue the women, especially Carmen, and the other women and men get jealous.  They fight over each other, and that is about it!  But they do so with very beautiful choreography.  This has always been a rather short ballet--a little less than an hour.  In the beginning of this DVD there is a short introduction with Ted Brandsen explaining his concept, and showing a little rehearsal.  His choreography is very classical, with a touch of modernism to tell the story convincingly.  The set is very plain and simple.  The camera work, image quality, and sound are all excellent.  Another nice touch in the DVD production is at the ending curtain call, the name of each and every one of the dancers appears above them, so there is no doubt who is who.  It would have been nice to have gotten more interviews and rehearsal footage, since there is plenty of room on the DVD, but it wasn't to be.

270551,A1ZXF4ZRLXV2YT,6301816064,King Arthur,"[1, 2]","Seeking a ballet performance of Carmen which reveals the erotica and sensuality in the role has become almost an obsession with me.  I have four performances, which have sorely disappointed me.  This DVD is a sad example of another disappointment.  I found the choreography a mish-mash of uncoordinated steps, whether by Carmen, or the men surrounding her.  So sad, because all the dancers, including the ballerina, tried so hard to make the piece come together.  The best performance of Carmen that I have seen is found on You Tube.  It shows Svetlans Zakharova in five excerpts from a Bolshoi performance of Carmen.  For some reason neither Amazon USA, UK, DE or FR carry this recording. How frustrating!  So go to You Tube, bring up Svetlana Zakharova and see her strut her stuff.  Her performance takes place in a bullring. Svetlana wears a red shift and later a black lacy dress.  She dances by herself except for a sequence with the toreador,  and another with the hapless French corporal.  Her dancing is sensuous, sultry, erotic and sexually stimulating!!  Svetlana's high extensions, lithe body movements, and her carriage, and her understanding of the passion of the music kept me in rapt attention. WOW!  Compare Svetlana's performance,as a soloist, and with the toreador and corporal, with that of the principals in the Australian Ballet exercise, and one will see what I mean. In opera performances of Carmen I recommend Anna Caterina Antonacci and Elena Garanca. But Svetlana, denied the additional asset of words and singing, makes her miming a more than admirable match for these two opera stars.  Talking of stars: Two Stars for this DVD, and they all belong to the Ballerina.  She tried so hard to please.

270552,A1JEFESGLIS076,6301816064,rsoonsa,"[4, 4]","This five scene ballet, based upon Bizet's 1875 opera, was choreographed by Roland Petit for his dance partner and wife, Zizi Jeanmaire, who premiered the character of the Spanish gypsy in 1949, Petit partnering her as Don Jos&eacute;.  In this film made 30 years after for Canadian television, ballet buffs will enjoy a 56 year old Jeanmaire as she reprises her part, while in this instance her partner is Mikhail Baryshnikov, artistic director of the American Ballet Theatre, who fills the role created by Petit, supported by the latter's troupe, Le Ballet National de Marseille, an organisation that he helmed for 26 years.  Some critics have expressed disdain for Jeanmaire's essay here, obviously having persuaded themselves that she was too old to play Carmen, specially when she was paired with an ebulliently callow Baryshnikov at the height of his terpsichorean powers.  Howbeit, the part is vested in her, and she fluently segues between the emotional plums that Petit has cleverly constructed, switching from one mood to another, all the while having complete command of the impassioned character, her favourite to dance.  There have been past a score of Carmen ballets formed upon Bizet's ever-popular work, a census of these revealing that each is married closely with the original.  In any event, this meridian of Petit's choreographic career has consistently packed the greatest punch for a good many audiences, and although he and Jeanmaire had filmed CARMEN elsewise, this concise (44 min.) production must be ranked near the top of the entire assemblage.  For it is here that Petit utilises that to which he has referred as his own ""ambience"", a blend of skills that includes more than dancing, as his well-drilled performers are trained to both sing and mime.  Petit has long wished to popularise ballet and, while episodes within this film are frankly erotic, they are yet not vulgar.  Although jazz-flavoured CARMEN is highly sensuous, it also is notably reflective of the irrational as well as pungent tone that Bizet creates for his musical melodrama.  At least as significant as contributions from the two leads are the dancing and acting of the corps, along with other soloists of the Marseille company, in particular Denys Ganio as the Toreador, rival of Don Jos&eacute;.  Petit's determination to film one final performance of his most famous work will be welcomed by a majority of the film's viewers.
