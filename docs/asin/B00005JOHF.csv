640319,A34VV92TSLC37R,B00005JOHF,Adam Craig,"[2, 3]","Cry Wolf is pretty much like any other slasher film that you may have seen in recent years.  The plot is pretty simple, although somewhat original.  A group of friends at a private high school decide to start a rumor of a serial killer on campus, as they try to trick all the other students into believing that a murder that happened near campus was really just the beginning of a serial killer's work.  The acting is simply terrible, but that's ok, I didn't rent Cry Wolf for the acting.  I even rented the ""unrated"" edition, and there was still absolutely no gore whatsoever, and that was what really disappointed me.  The only thing left for a slasher movie to do that hasn't been done before is kill the uninteresting main characters in a somewhat interesting way.The beginning of the film, where ""the game"" is set up, and the main character, Owen, gets to know all the participants isn't actually all that terrible.  The beginning is the reason it gets two stars and not one, that and the fact that it did have me guessing to a certain extent as to how the mystery was going to be solved.Needless to say, this movie includes all of the classic stereotypes of a slasher film.  So only rent this one if you know what you are getting into.  For slasher/horror aficionados, it probably isn't that bad that you just see it to see it, but anyone else, this movie probably isn't for you.",2,"Not total crap, but still crap",1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,1385,"['Cry', 'Wolf', 'pretty', 'much', 'other', 'slasher', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'recent', 'years', 'plot', 'pretty', 'simple', 'somewhat', 'original', 'group', 'friends', 'private', 'high', 'school', 'decide', 'start', 'rumor', 'serial', 'killer', 'campus', 'try', 'trick', 'other', 'students', 'believing', 'murder', 'happened', 'campus', 'was', 'really', 'just', 'beginning', 'serial', 'killer', 'work', 'acting', 'simply', 'terrible', 'ok', 'did', ""n't"", 'rent', 'Cry', 'Wolf', 'acting', 'even', 'rented', 'unrated', 'edition', 'there', 'was', 'still', 'absolutely', 'gore', 'whatsoever', 'was', 'what', 'really', 'disappointed', 'only', 'thing', 'left', 'slasher', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'before', 'kill', 'uninteresting', 'main', 'characters', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'way.The', 'beginning', 'film', 'where', 'game', 'set', 'up', 'main', 'character', 'Owen', 'know', 'participants', ""n't"", 'actually', 'all', 'terrible', 'beginning', 'reason', 'two', 'stars', 'not', 'one', 'fact', 'did', 'have', 'guessing', 'certain', 'extent', 'how', 'mystery', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'solved.Needless', 'say', 'movie', 'classic', 'stereotypes', 'slasher', 'film', 'only', 'rent', 'one', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'slasher/horror', 'aficionados', 'probably', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'see', 'see', 'anyone', 'else', 'movie', 'probably', ""n't""]",N/A

640321,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00005JOHF,A. Estes,"[0, 0]","It's funny how we're already in 2005. Hard to believe. As someone who grew up in the 90's, it's bizarre to think that era has passed. But a lot has changed since the 90's, and one of those things is the horror genre. In the 90's, horror was easily at it's weakest. The only dominating force was ""Scream"" and it's hordes of clones. These days, however, horror tends to go in two directions: Either it's brutal and gets a hard ""R,"" or it has a crappy ghost coming out of a TV, is remade about twenty times, and given a PG-13. ""Cry_Wolf"" is a film that calls back to the slasher films of the late 90's. In other words, it's a ""Scream""-esque who-dunnit with a low body count (I think the lowest ever for a horror movie) and virtually no gore. Oh yeah, and it's rated PG-13.The story revolves around a group of overpriviledged teens at a private school who are so bored with life that they play bizarre games with each other. Growing tired of the same old game, they invent a new one, one that will involve everyone at their school. Following the mysterious death of a local girl, they conjure up a myth about a serial killer on the loose and convince their fellow students that they are next in line. It's all fun and games until certain friends pop up missing, sound suspicious, or are seemingly being stalked. There are plenty of twists and turns and it's hard to see what's coming next, which is surprising for a movie of such a seemingly shallow nature. The acting isn't too bad, but there just isn't much to work with outside of the story. The dialogue isn't too sharp, the gore is almost non-existent, and the overall film looks pedestrian. If not for the surprise twists, I probably would have walked out after getting halfway through it. I can't really tell you what happens throughout the movie, as it will ruin what enjoyment you'll get out of it. But, if you need incentive to watch, just know that there is violence committed against Jon Bon Jovi.",3,Like Something Straight Out Of The 90's...,1127088000,"09 19, 2005",2005,1955,"['funny', 'how', ""'re"", 'already', '2005', 'Hard', 'believe', 'someone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', '90', 'bizarre', 'think', 'era', 'passed', 'lot', 'changed', '90', 'one', 'things', 'horror', 'genre', '90', 'horror', 'was', 'easily', 'weakest', 'only', 'dominating', 'force', 'was', 'Scream', 'hordes', 'clones', 'days', 'however', 'horror', 'tends', 'go', 'two', 'directions', 'brutal', 'hard', 'R', 'crappy', 'ghost', 'coming', 'TV', 'remade', 'twenty', 'times', 'given', 'PG-13', 'Cry_Wolf', 'film', 'back', 'slasher', 'films', 'late', '90', 'other', 'words', 'Scream', '-esque', 'who-dunnit', 'low', 'body', 'count', 'think', 'lowest', 'ever', 'horror', 'movie', 'virtually', 'gore', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'rated', 'PG-13.The', 'story', 'group', 'overpriviledged', 'teens', 'private', 'school', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'bored', 'life', 'play', 'bizarre', 'games', 'other', 'Growing', 'tired', 'same', 'old', 'game', 'invent', 'new', 'one', 'one', 'will', 'involve', 'everyone', 'school', 'Following', 'mysterious', 'death', 'local', 'girl', 'conjure', 'up', 'myth', 'serial', 'killer', 'loose', 'convince', 'fellow', 'students', 'are', 'next', 'line', 'fun', 'games', 'certain', 'friends', 'pop', 'up', 'missing', 'sound', 'suspicious', 'are', 'seemingly', 'being', 'stalked', 'are', 'plenty', 'twists', 'turns', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'coming', 'next', 'surprising', 'movie', 'such', 'seemingly', 'shallow', 'nature', 'acting', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'there', 'just', ""n't"", 'much', 'work', 'outside', 'story', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'too', 'sharp', 'gore', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'overall', 'film', 'pedestrian', 'not', 'surprise', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'walked', 'out', 'getting', 'halfway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'what', 'movie', 'will', 'ruin', 'what', 'enjoyment', ""'ll"", 'get', 'need', 'incentive', 'watch', 'just', 'know', 'violence', 'committed', 'Jon', 'Bon', 'Jovi']",N/A

Midway thru the movie I was thinking that if I had rented this thing I would have been stopping it and watching something else. Jon Bon Jovi is in this mess, and that's about the most interesting thing this has going for it. His acting leaves much to be desired however. The acting of the main cast members is pathetic as well. The greatest moment though comes at the end when Gary Cole speaks using a VERY poor English accent, it's quite laughable. Oh, the plot of the movie.

640325,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JOHF,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","To be honest, I actually find the concept behind this film to be rather intriguing.  I hate that it was thrown together so sloppily, because now that the `twist' has been used it will be harder for others to use it more creatively.  That said, the film is far from the train-wreck that so many want you to think that it is.  I'm keeping this short, since I don't want to give away too much (and for some reason I'm getting used to this `short review' idea).  Basically, the film consists of some school kids who decide to prank the school by creating a fake killer who winds up spawning a real killer who starts hacking up some kids, except everyone thinks the kids are still `crying wolf'.  Acting wise, it's hit and miss (Julian Morris and Lindy Booth being the `hit', Bon Jovi being the `miss'), but overall it's the structure of the film that kind of sinks it.  The PG-13 rating doesn't help much, but then again I have seen some `horror' films that made the best of their rating restrictions by creating surmountable terror without the gore, and `Cry_Wolf' could have done that as well, but it lacks the intensity needed to make this film as good as it could have been.

640327,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B00005JOHF,Anton Ilinski,"[1, 1]","I wouldn't say ""Cry_Wolf"" is a bad film. It's not. But I wouldn't praise it either. If you like recent teenage horrors, this whole stream of ""Screams"", ""I Know What You Did..."", ""Cursed"" etc. etc. I guess you'll like this one. But this type of movies is not my personal favourite. Horror is like porn - there's soft-horror and hardcore. So why watch soft if you can watch something real? I prefer latest ""brutal"" pictures like ""The Descent"", ""Devil's Rejects"", ""Hostel"" and so on. And ""Cry_Wolf"" is definately soft. But it's not the main reason I won't have it in my collection. It's just that it's rather ordinary - we've seen many thrillers like this. Just some elements of the story changed, some new characters and a new killer, but to be frankly I'd say you'll agree that it's just a modified version of ""Urban Legend"". Of course I don't mean this literally, ""Cry_Wolf"" has nothing to do with ""UL's"" story-line, but looks like both movies share the same carcass. Second thing is that makers of the film try so hard to entangle us, to make us take false trails their efforts seem a bit strained therefore helpless. Yes, the story has some twists in the end, but they are so cardboard I felt disappointed. This film lacks this sheer bloodcurdling effect good thrillers usually make.By the way I can never guess who the killer is watching thrillers and reading detective stories.

640328,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005JOHF,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 3]","Better be careful what you wish for. You just might get it. That is basically what comes to mind when watching this latest thriller designed and released for the pre-teen to teen set. The movie is not as horrible as people make it out to be, but it's not great either. The biggest crime this movie makes is that there is a lot of potential here and it doesn't achieve it. The plot, which we will get too in a minute, is actually not bad. There is potential in it for a genuinely scary and intriguing ride, but the finished film doesn't pull it off. Most of the clues and twists are generic and you could probably figure it out long before the climax comes. The movie is about a new student named Owen(Julian Morris), coming to Westlake Academy. A snooty prep school. He gets involved with Dodger(Lindy Booth), and her group of friends. The group get bored and Lindy decides to play a prank on the whole student body. A recent murder has everyone shook up, so she creates a story that has the killer coming to their campus. She and Julian concoct the whole thing right down to who dies and in what order. Soon enough, the group of friends think their make believe killer, The Wolf, is on campus and knocking everyone off as they had devised. I have to give credit to the filmmakers for doing something a little different, but they weren't entirely successful. The movie is too short with everything happening so quickly that it never really builds any sense of terror or atmosphere. We don't get to know the characters well enough. And speaking of characters, it would of been nice if they each had character instead of just being generic types from all other horror/slasher movies. The Wolf himself/herself is not seen much, and when they are, it doesn't add up to much, giving no real tension or fear in the killer at all. An orange ski mask and a camouflage jacket isn't exactly going to strike fear into people's hearts. The stalking factor was tame. There could be some fear and tension in getting evil messages, but the ones the killer gives on computers and text messages are so generic, and the filmmakers don't do anything with mood or scary music to try to make something out of it. However, the movie looks good. It's sharp looking and I like it's features. The cast isn't bad. Lindy Booth is a redheaded fox with a lot of charm and presence. Julian Morris, with his ""aw shucks"" looks and british accent is a charming enough leading man. The others fare less well. Jared Padalecki, who honed his horror chops in ""House Of Wax"" and is currently on the WB's ""Supernatural"", isn't playing a character much different from others he's played. Then there is Jon Bon Jovi. Interesting casting. He isn't bad, but you can't buy him as a teacher with his ""smart"" glasses on. I see him being serious and I'm thinking about ""Living On A Prayer"".

So unless something genuinely original and/or scary comes along, I will just sit and enjoy the same story with different characters. In this genre, rarely is their success with a male lead. He has to be vulnerable  to be believable. This movie is a thrill a minute. It is something new, refreshing and entertaining. The ending is a total surprise. Just when you think the credits will be up next, you get a surprise twist that no one would have fugured  was coming. The cast is refreshing , with mostly unrecognizable faces.The idea of a practical joke gone awry in this genre is not new, but this version , was fresh, innovative and entertaining. I bought this movie sight-unseen. I have bought slasher movies sight-unseen in the past and was extremely disappointed. Cannot say that with this diamond in the ruff.Julian Morris was excellent as the male lead. His face exuded that proverbial ""lamb in the woods, deer in the headlights"" cliche. Like Jamie Lee Curits in the first two ""Halloweens"", he also exemplified intelligence and determination. He was not the equivalent of the usual ""dumb jock"" or ""bonde ditz"", who falls and hurts her ankle, then limps along until the big knife stops her singing career. The fact that he is British added to the emphasis  already placed on him as the lead.You know that you really loved a movie when you hated for it to end and you continue the movie in your head. There are few movies I have felt that way about. This is one. Lindy Booth was excellent:not the sexiest, not the most beautiful, pretty enough to be believably devilish, yet innocent-looking enough to pull off what she did in the movie.I own many slasher flicks. This is one of the best. The story is not completely new, but you will never know that because of all that is in this movie. The acting is top notch, with moslty unknown actors. One benefit of a movie like this is its believability--Could it happen in real life? This always helps such a movie. The extras on the dvd are entertaining and only make you feel that you got more than your money's worth. Believe me, after watching this movie, you will get more than your money's worth.As slasher flicks go, this one was so good, that I did not even notice that it was not filled with gore and bringing outside the characters insideds, if you know what I mean. Too many movies in this genre make the mistake of thinking brains on the floor  or intestine on the walls is a substitute for a storyline. It is not. Having not picked up on this point, until I read someone else's review, made me realize all  the more how good this movie is. This was not just a slasher flick. It was a mystery wrapped around a slasher flick. You actuall had to think during the movie, as opposed to just sitting and enjoying a bunch of young white partyers, drug users, horny  partying teens getting slashed, sliced and falayed. So, while this movie did make me think, it did not do so capriciously, to the point that the thinking  overrode the entertaining.I understand that this is the director's first major motion picture. In a genre that is hard to stand out, this director did.So good it deserves a sequel.",4,You Will Be Thinking and Thanking All The Way Through,1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,3191,"['am', 'horror/slasher', 'movie', 'fanatic', 'So', 'something', 'genuinely', 'original', 'and/or', 'scary', 'along', 'will', 'just', 'sit', 'enjoy', 'same', 'story', 'different', 'characters', 'genre', 'rarely', 'success', 'male', 'lead', 'be', 'vulnerable', 'be', 'believable', 'movie', 'thrill', 'minute', 'something', 'new', 'refreshing', 'entertaining', 'ending', 'total', 'surprise', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'credits', 'will', 'be', 'up', 'next', 'get', 'surprise', 'twist', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'fugured', 'was', 'coming', 'cast', 'refreshing', 'mostly', 'unrecognizable', 'faces.The', 'idea', 'practical', 'joke', 'gone', 'awry', 'genre', 'not', 'new', 'version', 'was', 'fresh', 'innovative', 'entertaining', 'bought', 'movie', 'sight-unseen', 'have', 'bought', 'slasher', 'movies', 'sight-unseen', 'past', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'Can', 'not', 'say', 'diamond', 'ruff.Julian', 'Morris', 'was', 'excellent', 'male', 'lead', 'face', 'exuded', 'proverbial', 'lamb', 'woods', 'deer', 'headlights', 'cliche', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curits', 'first', 'two', 'Halloweens', 'also', 'exemplified', 'intelligence', 'determination', 'was', 'not', 'equivalent', 'usual', 'dumb', 'jock', 'bonde', 'ditz', 'who', 'ankle', 'then', 'along', 'big', 'knife', 'singing', 'career', 'fact', 'British', 'added', 'emphasis', 'already', 'placed', 'lead.You', 'know', 'really', 'loved', 'movie', 'when', 'hated', 'end', 'continue', 'movie', 'head', 'are', 'few', 'movies', 'have', 'felt', 'way', 'one', 'Lindy', 'Booth', 'was', 'excellent', 'not', 'sexiest', 'not', 'most', 'beautiful', 'pretty', 'enough', 'be', 'believably', 'devilish', 'yet', 'innocent-looking', 'enough', 'pull', 'off', 'what', 'did', 'movie.I', 'own', 'many', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'one', 'best', 'story', 'not', 'completely', 'new', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'movie', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'moslty', 'unknown', 'actors', 'One', 'benefit', 'movie', 'believability', 'Could', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'always', 'such', 'movie', 'extras', 'dvd', 'are', 'entertaining', 'only', 'make', 'feel', 'got', 'more', 'money', 'worth', 'Believe', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'get', 'more', 'money', 'worth.As', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'go', 'one', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'notice', 'was', 'not', 'filled', 'gore', 'bringing', 'characters', 'insideds', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Too', 'many', 'movies', 'genre', 'make', 'mistake', 'thinking', 'brains', 'floor', 'intestine', 'walls', 'substitute', 'storyline', 'not', 'Having', 'not', 'picked', 'up', 'point', 'read', 'someone', 'else', 'review', 'made', 'realize', 'more', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'slasher', 'flick', 'was', 'mystery', 'wrapped', 'slasher', 'flick', 'actuall', 'had', 'think', 'movie', 'opposed', 'just', 'sitting', 'enjoying', 'bunch', 'young', 'white', 'partyers', 'drug', 'users', 'horny', 'partying', 'teens', 'getting', 'slashed', 'sliced', 'falayed', 'So', 'movie', 'did', 'make', 'think', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'capriciously', 'point', 'thinking', 'overrode', 'entertaining.I', 'understand', 'director', 'first', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'genre', 'hard', 'stand', 'out', 'director', 'did.So', 'good', 'sequel']",N/A

640334,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B00005JOHF,Boss Fan,"[4, 4]","I am so sick of the teen slasher movie.  It seems there is a new one every other month, and combine them with all the other clieched horror films that flood the market on a constant basis, there is just no need to sit through another movie about a bunch of kids who get picked off one by one by a masked killer while making all the usual mistakes.So I had no desire to see ""cry_wolf,"" which presented itself proudly as a movie that was as simplistic as I just described (kids, masked killer, lots of running and screaming).  I do however believe that it is possible to make a good movie from the scraps of lesser, and/or overdone ones.  If ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" could attempt a take on a genre pioneered by the high standard of horror films - ""The Exorcist"" (and then exploited to death by 20 years of knock-offs) - without not only not embaressing itself, but actually making a thoughtfull, even intersting film (instead of just an attempt to scare and shock audiences) than anything's possible.""cry_wolf"" may still be just yet another lazy attempt by a studio to cash in by squeezing every last drop of pocket change from this type of movie's key demographic, but the filmmakersat least aspired to craft a clever film.  Even if it's no classic and clever often means pile on plot twists, at least it trys to keep you guessing, rather than just fill the screen with blood and grizzly death scenes.  While the twist ending has been getting a workout since ""The Sixth Sense,"" at least here it contributes to the best part of this slasher flick, which is to question if it is actually a slasher flick at all.In 2005, it is surprising it took this long to make a teen-horror movie that incorporates Instand Messaging, Text Messaging, Camera Phones, and other communication technology to figure so prominantly into its plot.  But it's nice someone has decided to do it.  You almost wonder why, when the lead actor is listening to his walkman while moping the floor, the prop department didn't think to give him an i-pod (esspecially considering the age of the cast, they all probably had their own sitting in their dressing rooms).The biggest surprise may be, in a great bit of absurdist casting, Jon Bon Jovi as an english teacher.  An even better surprise is how solid a screen presence he is and that, rather than being just a glorified rock star cameo thrown in for laughs, he has a substantsial part that figures prominantly into the film.  Good for him.  The rest of the cast, too, works out nicely.  There may be no breakout stars here for sure, but I would not be suprised to see a few of these kids in the future.Fans of the Jason/Freddy-style flicks this movie looked to be in its previews will probably be disapointed by the lack of gore, nudity, and relatively few killings.  It aspires to be more of a mystery.  Even if it only half succeeds, at least its something different and unexpected.  I'm not really sure why there is an unrated version of this (actually, I am:  $$$), because there is no nudity, f-bombs, and the violence is minimal and would pass for PG-13, so it is a bit of an insulting cheat to slap unrated across the box, but this is becoming increasingly common in the DVD world.  To get down on this movie for it would hardly be fair since you'd have to knock points off for nearly every movie now-a-days.""cry_wolf"" is not great, it is hardly original, but it kept me far more interested and entertained than I ever imagined it would.  If you're thinking the same way I was, give it a chance.

Now they are being hunted by a 'Wolf' that they created.  They are the sheep.  Get it?

""Cry Wolf"" has more in common with teen flicks like ""Gossip"" or ""The Skulls"". It's a murder mystery with horror elements.

There is hardly any blood shed, no nudity and very little cursing. My guess is the film makers didn't want their movie lumped in with all the other PG-13 teen screamer movies that have come out lately, and are trying to use the ""unrated"" moniker to lure in the large horror film fan base. As far as being a murder mystery, at times ""Cry Wolf"" can be fun, but the countless twists and turns the movie takes gets tiresome and convoluted.

They deliver a double twist ending that is sure to please those who like the psychological dramas. The problem here is that the characters who ""die"" are not really worth caring about at all. The director and the actors in their poor role portrayal seem to want to make it a good thing the teens are being victimized, and that doesn't play well when you are watching the main character being traumatized by having to watch each one of his friends being 'murdered' in the exact same fashion as they do in his invented game of cry wolf. You want to empathize but you just cant when his friends act with less ability than Rosie the robot on The Jetsons. The visual effects are minimal but effective, angles interesting and pacing quick and the finale isn't foolishly cumbersome, just smart.

But it's not only a good satire, but a good movie in its own right -- it deceives you right up to the end, with a complex twist that suddenly pulls the whole movie into focus.Owen (Julian Morris) has just arrived at the prestigious Westlake high school, and it doesn't take him long to get acquainted with his jock roommate Tom (Jared Padalecki), the sexy school queen Dodger (Lindy Booth) and their pals. The gang all gathers together at the school chapel at night, to play an elaborate lying game -- until Dodger suggests they use a recent murder as part of an elaborate prank.The kids send out a mass email saying that a mythical killer called the Wolf is on campus, about to kill again. But soon the prank becomes a series of vindictive, dirty secrets are revealed, and Owen is sent a series of threatening IMs from ""The Wolf."" And then suddenly the fake deaths they dreamed up begin to come true -- but what is real, and what is a deadly prank?Don't go into ""Cry Wolf"" expecting lots of shrieky, bloody teen horror, or you'll be disappointed. Not much gore, not even much violence. It's actually more like a murder mystery (both before and after the fact), disguised as a teen slasher flick. Certainly it's a lot smarter than your typical high-school movie.The complexity doesn't really show up until the finale, when the seemingly simple plot turns around and pulls all its strings tight. Hardly a plot hole to be found. People you thought were dead aren't, and a childish prank turns out to be far more sinister. Writer/director Jeff Wadlow soaks the movie in a tongue-in-cheek atmosphere, and a sense of intellectual horror as well as visceral thrills.It also takes a few minutes out to mock slasher flicks, like the ""so cliche"" idea of a killer hiding in the backseat. The cast seems like a typical slasher cast, but more realistic -- the slut is flirty but not actually slutty, like a girl who is still getting used to her own attractiveness. The brainiac doesn't flaunt her intelligence, the chubby kid isn't funny, and the jock isn't a lunkhead.Julian Morris gives a subtle, understated portrayal of a troubled young boy with a checkered past. Owen is essentially a good kid, but led into trouble by that classic downfall -- he's trying to impress the hot girl with his intelligence. Morris's finest acting comes in the final scenes on the movie, where his expressive eyes show terror, desperation, numbness, and finally frustrated horror.""Cry Wolf"" is a far smarter, creepier movie than most satires, and it also manages to be a clever flick in its own right.

640356,AD9MPLYLMHKCC,B00005JOHF,Ghoulie Guru,"[0, 0]","WARNING: possible spoilers ahead...From the trailer I thought this was gonna be just some lame PG-13 STRANGELAND ripoff. Some scary killer guy sending instant messages to teenagers. I've seen that movie a bazillion times. So I went into this thinking that it was going to be a fairly predictable SWIMFAN type of thriller. I thought it was just another watered down horror movie for the masses, a movie for the sheep. But this movie surprised me. It ended up being about something a little more interesting than just a killer who stalks his victims over the internet. This movie's got a little more bite to it than you might think. It really is a Wolf in Sheep's clothing.Shame on the marketing at Focus for misrepresenting this movie to the horror community. They evidently thought that all we want to see is some lame masked killer running around with a knife. The marketing people completely downplayed the slightly more intelligent aspect of this movie and went for a standard Masked Killer on Campus approach. Actually, this movie is closer to David Fincher's THE GAME than it is to SWIMFAN. The theatrical release of this movie was probably also harmed by the fact that they felt the need to change it into a PG-13 movie, to try and scoop up a larger box office. The unrated version that you can rent at Blockbuster or buy on Amazon, is a movie worth checking out.Now, don't get me wrong, this is NOT cinema at its finest. It's filled with all kinds of teeny bopper cliches, it features Jon Bon Jovi as a journalism teacher and the lead character is a girl named Dodger. Come on, who's named Dodger? But even with points taken off for bad casting and stereotypical quirky teen characterization, this actually wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Nothing like going into a movie with ridiculously low expectations and coming out pleasantly surprised. The last time that happened to me was when I went in to see BUTTERFLY EFFECT. But I digress.The basic idea is this: A bunch of bored prep school kids decide to create a killer. They weave an elaborate urban myth around a recent slaying at their school, and pretty soon they are all being stalked by this fictional killer. Viewers are left wondering if this fictional killer is one of the kids who's gone over to the dark side, or if it's all some elaborate hoax, or if it's the actual killer who's pissed off that these kids decided to make up a story about him. There are all kinds of red herrings throughout, and the killer might even be the Bon Jovi journalism teacher. I'm not going to spoil it for you, because the whole movie is only interesting as long as you don't really know what's going on.End analysis: This is a decent little thriller that suffered from some really bad marketing and an obligatory PG-13 rating. If you rent or buy the unrated version of DVD, and go into it expecting to see a slasher movie with a lemon twist, you might just find yourself pleasantly surprised like I was.",3,A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,2966,"['WARNING', 'possible', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'trailer', 'thought', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'just', 'lame', 'PG-13', 'STRANGELAND', 'ripoff', 'scary', 'killer', 'guy', 'sending', 'instant', 'messages', 'teenagers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'bazillion', 'times', 'went', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'SWIMFAN', 'type', 'thriller', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'watered', 'down', 'horror', 'movie', 'masses', 'movie', 'sheep', 'movie', 'surprised', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'interesting', 'just', 'killer', 'who', 'victims', 'internet', 'movie', 'got', 'little', 'more', 'bite', 'might', 'think', 'really', 'Wolf', 'Sheep', 'clothing.Shame', 'marketing', 'Focus', 'misrepresenting', 'movie', 'horror', 'community', 'evidently', 'thought', 'want', 'see', 'lame', 'masked', 'killer', 'running', 'around', 'knife', 'marketing', 'people', 'completely', 'downplayed', 'slightly', 'more', 'intelligent', 'aspect', 'movie', 'went', 'standard', 'Masked', 'Killer', 'Campus', 'approach', 'Actually', 'movie', 'closer', 'David', 'Fincher', 'THE', 'GAME', 'SWIMFAN', 'theatrical', 'release', 'movie', 'was', 'probably', 'also', 'harmed', 'fact', 'felt', 'need', 'change', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'try', 'scoop', 'up', 'larger', 'box', 'office', 'unrated', 'version', 'can', 'rent', 'Blockbuster', 'buy', 'Amazon', 'movie', 'checking', 'out.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'NOT', 'cinema', 'finest', 'filled', 'kinds', 'teeny', 'bopper', 'cliches', 'Jon', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'journalism', 'teacher', 'lead', 'character', 'girl', 'named', 'Dodger', 'Come', 'who', 'named', 'Dodger', 'even', 'points', 'taken', 'off', 'bad', 'casting', 'stereotypical', 'quirky', 'teen', 'characterization', 'actually', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Nothing', 'going', 'movie', 'ridiculously', 'low', 'expectations', 'coming', 'out', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'last', 'time', 'happened', 'was', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'BUTTERFLY', 'EFFECT', 'digress.The', 'basic', 'idea', 'bunch', 'bored', 'prep', 'school', 'kids', 'decide', 'create', 'killer', 'weave', 'elaborate', 'urban', 'myth', 'recent', 'slaying', 'school', 'pretty', 'soon', 'are', 'being', 'stalked', 'fictional', 'killer', 'Viewers', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'fictional', 'killer', 'one', 'kids', 'who', 'gone', 'dark', 'side', 'elaborate', 'hoax', 'actual', 'killer', 'who', 'pissed', 'off', 'kids', 'decided', 'make', 'up', 'story', 'are', 'kinds', 'red', 'herrings', 'killer', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'journalism', 'teacher', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'whole', 'movie', 'only', 'interesting', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'on.End', 'analysis', 'decent', 'little', 'thriller', 'suffered', 'really', 'bad', 'marketing', 'obligatory', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'rent', 'buy', 'unrated', 'version', 'DVD', 'go', 'expecting', 'see', 'slasher', 'movie', 'lemon', 'twist', 'might', 'just', 'find', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'was']",N/A
640357,A2SRP2HP75CUVD,B00005JOHF,Horror-Fanatics.com,"[4, 6]","This is another huge example of how the commercials on tv can be really misleading. Im sure that if you've seen the Cry Wolf previews it looks like another one of those typical teen slasher films. Well after watching this film for myself I realized that I let the commercials get to me. I actually enjoy watching some of those repetitive teen slashers. So going into this movie thats what I expected. Now dont get me wrong, I wasn't expecting the movie to be the greatest horror flick of all time. I just wanted to see something campy and fun, I mean who doesnt enjoy seeing a bunch of kids running scared and getting chopped up by a maniac in a mask? But ladies and gentlemen don't let the commercials fool you, because this movie isn't what it looks like.In the movie Cry Wolf a girl is murdered in cold blood off late at night in the woods. Then a group of teens who are fond of playing truth and lie games decide to do something extra fun. So they decide to play that same game with the entire school. Forwarding messages to all the students and teachers information about a serial killer by the name of Wolf. Once word spreads around the rumors, weird events begin to occur and the kids soon find out that the joke is getting way out of hand and that someone is trying to turn the joke into reality. Little by little each of the kids begin to point fingers, but its a question of who really is the wolf.Perhaps it was my fault for thinking this was actually going to be a good horror movie, when in fact this movie shouldn't even be called horror. I was just so attached to the plot and the cool commercials. I must abmit the first half of the film is actually pretty good. The whole ""sheep and wolf"" theme really fits in. Most of it is about the main characters pulling a prank and playing games with the entire school. The first half of the film is meant to build up the suspense for what is to come later on. Not to mention they had a pretty good story behind it all. But once the first half is finished the film just sinks down and ends up being nothing more than just a joke. There are moments in the film which kill the suspense and makes things not so suprising at all.I would get into more detail about it but I dont want to ruin anything incase you guys want to check it out for yourselves. But trust me this movie is just a mystery/thriller meant for todays generation of teenagers. This movie is nothing new at all, we've seen this kind of stuff before and this film does nothing to make it better. After the first half of the movie everything just went to hell. This film isnt a slasher at all, don't let the commercials fool you. Most of the acting in this movie is just awful. Even the so called serial killer is laughable, thats the saddest part of the whole thing.The biggest problem I had with this film was that it was just very predictable. I pretty much guessed the end result after watching the half of the movie, and I was right!!! It ended the way I imagined it. Theres also a small twist near the end which is meant to be so shocking. But trust me the twist is nothing suprising at all, lets just say you'll see it coming. This film was just way too predictable. I really wanted it to be about a serial killer who goes around and kills Prep school kids, but oh well. This movie isnt what the commercials make it out to be.Overall Cry Wolf is just a predictable teen Suspense/Mystery. Its nothing new at all and with such a promising plot it could have been alot better. Cry Wolf was the exact opposite of what I was hoping it to be and it was just all too predictable. I walked into this hoping it would be another one of those fun teenage slasher flicks, but its not at all and it just falls short in almost every aspect. I didnt think the ending was all that great either, like I said before I saw it coming and it just wasnt exciting at all. But we all have our own different opinions and tastes so im sure that there are people out there who are going to enjoy it. If you are going to see it anyway I highly recommend to not expect so much.",2,"Don't be fooled, it's not a horror movie",1149033600,"05 31, 2006",2006,4073,"['huge', 'example', 'how', 'commercials', 'tv', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'misleading', 'Im', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Cry', 'Wolf', 'one', 'typical', 'teen', 'slasher', 'films', 'Well', 'watching', 'film', 'realized', 'let', 'commercials', 'get', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'repetitive', 'teen', 'slashers', 'So', 'going', 'movie', 'what', 'expected', 'Now', 'get', 'wrong', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'movie', 'be', 'greatest', 'horror', 'flick', 'time', 'just', 'wanted', 'see', 'something', 'campy', 'fun', 'mean', 'who', 'doesnt', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'bunch', 'kids', 'running', 'scared', 'getting', 'chopped', 'up', 'maniac', 'mask', 'ladies', 'gentlemen', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'commercials', 'fool', 'movie', ""n't"", 'what', 'movie', 'Cry', 'Wolf', 'girl', 'murdered', 'cold', 'blood', 'off', 'late', 'night', 'woods', 'Then', 'group', 'teens', 'who', 'are', 'fond', 'playing', 'truth', 'lie', 'games', 'decide', 'do', 'something', 'extra', 'fun', 'decide', 'play', 'same', 'game', 'entire', 'school', 'Forwarding', 'messages', 'students', 'teachers', 'information', 'serial', 'killer', 'name', 'Wolf', 'Once', 'word', 'rumors', 'weird', 'events', 'begin', 'occur', 'kids', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'joke', 'getting', 'way', 'hand', 'someone', 'trying', 'turn', 'joke', 'reality', 'Little', 'little', 'kids', 'begin', 'point', 'fingers', 'question', 'who', 'really', 'wolf.Perhaps', 'was', 'fault', 'thinking', 'was', 'actually', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'when', 'fact', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'called', 'horror', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'attached', 'plot', 'cool', 'commercials', 'must', 'abmit', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'whole', 'sheep', 'wolf', 'theme', 'really', 'Most', 'main', 'characters', 'pulling', 'prank', 'playing', 'games', 'entire', 'school', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'meant', 'build', 'up', 'suspense', 'what', 'come', 'later', 'Not', 'mention', 'had', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'once', 'first', 'half', 'finished', 'film', 'just', 'sinks', 'down', 'up', 'being', 'nothing', 'more', 'just', 'joke', 'are', 'moments', 'film', 'suspense', 'things', 'not', 'so', 'suprising', 'all.I', 'would', 'get', 'more', 'detail', 'dont', 'want', 'ruin', 'anything', 'incase', 'guys', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'yourselves', 'movie', 'just', 'mystery/thriller', 'meant', 'todays', 'generation', 'teenagers', 'movie', 'nothing', 'new', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'kind', 'stuff', 'film', 'nothing', 'make', 'better', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'everything', 'just', 'went', 'hell', 'film', 'slasher', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'commercials', 'fool', 'Most', 'acting', 'movie', 'just', 'awful', 'Even', 'so', 'called', 'serial', 'killer', 'laughable', 'saddest', 'part', 'whole', 'thing.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'just', 'very', 'predictable', 'pretty', 'much', 'guessed', 'end', 'result', 'watching', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'right', 'ended', 'way', 'imagined', 'also', 'small', 'twist', 'end', 'meant', 'be', 'so', 'shocking', 'twist', 'nothing', 'suprising', 'just', 'say', ""'ll"", 'see', 'coming', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'predictable', 'really', 'wanted', 'be', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'around', 'Prep', 'school', 'kids', 'oh', 'well', 'movie', 'what', 'commercials', 'make', 'be.Overall', 'Cry', 'Wolf', 'just', 'predictable', 'teen', 'Suspense/Mystery', 'nothing', 'new', 'such', 'promising', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'alot', 'better', 'Cry', 'Wolf', 'was', 'exact', 'opposite', 'what', 'was', 'hoping', 'be', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'predictable', 'walked', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'fun', 'teenage', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'not', 'just', 'short', 'almost', 'aspect', 'didnt', 'think', 'ending', 'was', 'great', 'said', 'saw', 'coming', 'just', 'wasnt', 'exciting', 'have', 'own', 'different', 'opinions', 'tastes', 'so', 'im', 'sure', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'enjoy', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'anyway', 'highly', 'recommend', 'not', 'expect', 'so', 'much']",N/A

I could not relate to any of the characters in this film, so I did not care what happends to them.  I guess I did not like this film mostly because it was so unbelivable.  Spoilers!You mean to tell me that this whole thing was just a prank by bunch of college kids?  I know bunch of college students who loves to do pranks on friends, but I don't know any of them would take things this far.  In this movie, they were all supposed to be friends who cared about one another.  But, when the Brittish guy starts to freak out, don't you think that they would have all stopped picking on him?  When they all finally told another who emailed the Brittish guy, and who try to attack him, I thought that would be the end of it because the Brittish guy was getting very angry with them all for picking on him, but they continued on.  When the girl chased him out of a car he was in, and she ran around with a big knife, a police stopped her and she confessed that she was just trying to tease him.  She went to the president's office and told her everything.  Then, after all this, her friends continuelly tormented this Brithish guy?

It's really not a bad little horror movie, but it has alot of flaws and some credibilty issues. The two leads are great, I really enjoyed both of them, specifically our female lead, Lindy Booth, she is gorgeous and quite an impressive actress. She was awesome in being pretty and 'normal' one minute, then being sexy and dangerous the next. She keeps you guessing until the very end, and I won't give it away, but she really makes it worth your while to stick around and figure out who-done-it.....Julian Morris plays our male lead and although I'm not to familiar with him, I like what I saw, he is very sharp, ladies are going to love his innocent yet confident look, plus he too is a pretty good actor.A young man with a checkered past joins another private school and instantly hits it off with a stunning red head, she in turn introduces him to a 'game' her and her friends play. You lie and scam your way into finding out who is the wolf and the sheep in your group, if you guess incorrectly, you have to leave. At first, all seems innocent, until our group takes it too far and make up a 'wolf' that is a serial killer attacking students at there school. They start all these 'rumors' using the internet, and pretty soon the whole school is terrified. Of course a few killings take place and obviously someone is taking this game a bit too far........but who?There are several plot twists and turns, most fun, a few that were pointless. The ending is pretty silly and contrived, but you can forgive that because you're going to have some fun in getting to that ending. It's not very scary, a few of the internet moments are done well and suspensefull. Unfortunately, this got hit with the stupid ""unrated' tag, and it is totally useless in this movie, there is very little gore, also very little sex and nudity, mostly just language and some blood here and there, easily a PG-13, even 11-12 year olds could watch it, and probably enjoy it too.Jon Bon Jovi really needs to just stick to music, he is just awful as a teacher who is also sleeping with our hero, this role would have been perfect for an actor who can be sleazy yet educated, Jon is just too 'pretty' We could also have had more of Jared Padalecki, he plays the cocky rebel role of the group and is not used nearly enough.So, not bad, not worth buying, but I got a kick out of it for the most part.

In the vein of ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Wild Things,"" this psycho-sexual horror film contains a tremendous amount of deception and manipulation.A young girl is shot, her corpse found hidden in the woods.  A group of friends at the prestigious Westlake Preparatory Academy decide to play a prank on the rest of the school.  They invent a serial killer who calls himself the Wolf; responsible for murdering the townie who was found dead in the woods, he plans to kill students on Halloween night.  Unfortunately, the prank becomes all too real as students are slaughtered like sheep.""Cry_Wolf boasts quite a number of surprises and twists.  The ending is quite clever and shocking.  Great performances are given by leads Julian Morris (""Owen"") and Lindy Booth (""Dodger"") whose characters frantically search for the killer's true identity before more friends die.  A good soundtrack adds to the suspense.  The credits song, ""Shoot Your Gun"" by 22-20s, is very appropriate, much like ""Fade to Black"" was for ""Prom Night"" (the original).I am a big fan of Italian gialli (mysteries exported from Italy during the sixties and seventies) and found ""Cry_Wolf"" extremely suspenseful.  If you love a good mystery, then I recommend this film.  Furthermore, if you have already seen ""Cry_Wolf"" and enjoyed it, I recommend the remake of ""April Fool's Day,"" which also has a double twist ending that is quite diabolical.",5,Cry Wolf Is The Ultimate Game Of Deception That Could End Your Life,1245024000,"06 15, 2009",2009,1481,"['Cry_Wolf', 'expertly', 'crafted', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'director', 'Jeff', 'Wadlow', 'vein', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'Wild', 'Things', 'psycho-sexual', 'horror', 'film', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'deception', 'manipulation.A', 'young', 'girl', 'shot', 'corpse', 'found', 'hidden', 'woods', 'group', 'friends', 'prestigious', 'Westlake', 'Preparatory', 'Academy', 'decide', 'play', 'prank', 'rest', 'school', 'invent', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'Wolf', 'responsible', 'murdering', 'townie', 'who', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'woods', 'kill', 'students', 'Halloween', 'night', 'Unfortunately', 'prank', 'too', 'real', 'students', 'are', 'slaughtered', 'sheep', 'Cry_Wolf', 'quite', 'number', 'surprises', 'twists', 'ending', 'quite', 'clever', 'shocking', 'Great', 'performances', 'are', 'given', 'leads', 'Julian', 'Morris', 'Owen', 'Lindy', 'Booth', 'Dodger', 'characters', 'frantically', 'search', 'killer', 'true', 'identity', 'more', 'friends', 'die', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'suspense', 'credits', 'song', 'Shoot', 'Your', 'Gun', '22-20s', 'very', 'appropriate', 'much', 'Fade', 'Black', 'was', 'Prom', 'Night', 'original', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Italian', 'gialli', 'mysteries', 'exported', 'Italy', 'sixties', 'seventies', 'found', 'Cry_Wolf', 'extremely', 'suspenseful', 'love', 'good', 'mystery', 'then', 'recommend', 'film', 'Furthermore', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'Cry_Wolf', 'enjoyed', 'recommend', 'remake', 'April', 'Fool', 'Day', 'also', 'double', 'twist', 'ending', 'quite', 'diabolical']",N/A

For eights friends, lies and deceit are their bedfellows. With one marked as the wolf, the sheep have to cull him out; though this isn't a game to band together, it's your own skin your out to save. Queen bee of the group Dodger, sick of the little group games decide to go further. After news that a girl was killed in the woods, they spawn a fictitious serial killer, with the killer residing on campus. Though lies can become an ugly truth.Writers and Director Jeff Wadlow and Beau Bauman won the Chrysler Million Dollar Film Festival, for this script, which in affect tries to spin the teen slasher film genre around. Cry Wolf's premise isn't wholly original; mixing teen slashers Urban Ledgens, Scream as the basis with others thrown in. Also thrown into the mix is Gossip; the destructive power of gossip and lies. Taking the most interesting elements from those films, which keep this from flat lining, Wadlow and Bauman have taken in to much and regurgitated whatever they could and put it all together rather haphazardly.Relying on twists upon twists and buckets of red herrings, the story comes of contrived and predictable. To much time is spent trying to lead you off the mark, who's pulling the strings, it reaches a point you just wish the killer would starting knocking people off. The eight friends are really unredeemable and annoying. Their future on whether or not they live doesn't become a major point; you're not rooting for their survival. All the actors don't display believable performances, trying to show maturity while they look nothing but immature.For a teen slasher thriller, Cry Wolf lacks a lot of tension. It's very dry in the scare department, with your pulse failing rise. The tension never tightens, not even the gloomy stressed visual style raises the taught levels. When the killer finally tackles his job, each attack verges laughable and moronic, with each failing swipe of his knife. The ski masked killer also lacks menace, not an image that stays on the psychosis.Cry Wolf has good intentions to be a good thriller, though a lot of bad things were done on good intentions.",3,Cry Wolf has good intentions,1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,2209,"['constantly', 'tell', 'lies', 'who', 'going', 'believe', 'truth', 'nobody', 'liar', 'eights', 'friends', 'lies', 'deceit', 'are', 'bedfellows', 'one', 'marked', 'wolf', 'sheep', 'have', 'cull', 'out', ""n't"", 'game', 'band', 'together', 'own', 'skin', 'save', 'Queen', 'bee', 'group', 'Dodger', 'sick', 'little', 'group', 'games', 'decide', 'go', 'further', 'news', 'girl', 'was', 'killed', 'woods', 'spawn', 'fictitious', 'serial', 'killer', 'killer', 'residing', 'campus', 'lies', 'can', 'become', 'ugly', 'truth.Writers', 'Director', 'Jeff', 'Wadlow', 'Beau', 'Bauman', 'won', 'Chrysler', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Film', 'Festival', 'script', 'affect', 'tries', 'spin', 'teen', 'slasher', 'film', 'genre', 'around', 'Cry', 'Wolf', 'premise', ""n't"", 'wholly', 'original', 'mixing', 'teen', 'slashers', 'Urban', 'Ledgens', 'Scream', 'basis', 'others', 'thrown', 'Also', 'thrown', 'mix', 'Gossip', 'destructive', 'power', 'gossip', 'Taking', 'most', 'interesting', 'elements', 'films', 'keep', 'flat', 'lining', 'Wadlow', 'Bauman', 'have', 'taken', 'much', 'regurgitated', 'whatever', 'could', 'put', 'together', 'rather', 'haphazardly.Relying', 'twists', 'twists', 'buckets', 'red', 'herrings', 'story', 'contrived', 'predictable', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'trying', 'lead', 'off', 'mark', 'who', 'pulling', 'strings', 'point', 'just', 'wish', 'killer', 'would', 'starting', 'knocking', 'people', 'off', 'eight', 'friends', 'are', 'really', 'unredeemable', 'annoying', 'future', 'not', 'live', ""n't"", 'become', 'major', 'point', ""'re"", 'not', 'rooting', 'survival', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'display', 'believable', 'performances', 'trying', 'show', 'maturity', 'look', 'nothing', 'teen', 'slasher', 'thriller', 'Cry', 'Wolf', 'lot', 'tension', 'very', 'dry', 'scare', 'department', 'pulse', 'failing', 'rise', 'tension', 'never', 'tightens', 'not', 'even', 'gloomy', 'stressed', 'visual', 'style', 'taught', 'levels', 'When', 'killer', 'finally', 'job', 'attack', 'laughable', 'moronic', 'failing', 'swipe', 'knife', 'ski', 'masked', 'killer', 'also', 'menace', 'not', 'image', 'psychosis.Cry', 'Wolf', 'good', 'intentions', 'be', 'good', 'thriller', 'lot', 'bad', 'things', 'were', 'done', 'good', 'intentions']",N/A

640369,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B00005JOHF,Kevin Killian,"[0, 1]","We used to look in awe at the genius of Anna Deavere Smith and her groundbreaking experiments in theater!  She's the author of FIRES IN THE MIRROR and TWILIGHT: LOS ANGELES, the searching sweeping portrayal of a contested Eden in the wake of the Rodney King incident. James Baldwin told her that she would grow up and become the next Lorraine Hansberry!  NEWSWEEK magazine said she was ""the most exciting individual in American theater.""  She even won the MacArthur genius award, but oh, what happened to all that genius!  I swallowed in outrage last year when she played the mother of Tracie Thoms in RENT--a totally untenable character which ADS didn't even try playing--she just made one face and kept it up through the entire scene she was featured in.  And now her performance in CRY WOLF really takes the cake.  It is not only abysmal, but it makes you think, what happens in Hollywood when black actresses, even geniuses, turn 30, does the screen just swallow them up to make room for younger types like Beyonce?  In CRY WOLF poor ADS has to play the dictatorial, badly dressed principal at a posh American boarding school--Headmaster Tinsley.  When the young British schoolboy in her charge goes bad, or seems to (he's actually being framed but that won't be any surprise), she decides to expel him summarily.Oddly enough I think maybe some scenes were cut out of the script--perhaps filmed, perhaps not, but maybe when ADS read the script her part had more meat in it.  In one scene, Headmaster Tinsley interrupts one of her tirades when a little boy, dressed in regulation blazer, bursts into her study.  It turns out this is her son and she gives him a huge hug, asking him why he has come to interrupt her discipline sessions.  I figured--why, anyone would figure--that the fact that Headmaster Tinsley has a ten year old son wandering around the campus would somehow come up later in the story.  Perhaps the ""Wolf"" (the serial killer roaming the campus) would kidnap the boy to get a rise out of ADS.But no, you never see him again.  Nor her.The movie is sadly understaffed, just like the school (the only teacher is apparently Jon Bon Jovi, whom I don't feel so bad for, because at least he has a few meaty scenes which he plays well despite all the botox injected into his face).  In crowd scenes it's noteworthy that it seems that only 15 students at the most go to this school.  Most of the action is played with a handful of youngsters, notably Owen, the short, British boy with the cold British father played for some reason by Gary Cole with a terrible UK accent, and ""Dodger,"" the elegant, red-headed boarder who hides a terrible secret.  No, wait, three terrible secrets.  Neither Owen nor Dodger is up to much acting, and that's a pity in an intricately plotted movie like this.  ""Dodger"" thinks she's Kathleen Turner in BODY HEAT, but actually she's more like Annette in BEACH PARTY.  Well, it's all good, it's just a shame the depths to which MacArthur genius Anna Deavere Smith is sinking nowadays.  But as I said above perhaps there's a systemic failure which guarantees humiliation for black actresses of a certain age.

The first person he meets is Dodger (Lindy Booth), who turns out to be the leader of the local pack, one of whom is Owen's new roommate, Tom (Jared Padalecki).  In the middle of his first night Tom wakes Owen up and takes him to the church on campus where everybody antes up and they play a game run by Dodger.  It has to do with figuring out who is telling lies and who is not, making much of the distinction between wolves and sheep, with some shepherds tossed in for good measure.  The game proves to be relatively easy for Owen, who has no problem taking advantage of a bunch of bored rich kids.  Dodger also does not find it challenging to be playing chess with a bunch of kids who are playing checkers.  So the two come up with a new game in which their group will be the wolves and the rest of the campus will be the sheep.So they decide to take the recent murder of a local girl and spin a story about her being the victim of a serial killer known as the Wolf.  They give him a few iconic characteristics (big knife and an orange ski mask) and come up with gruesome deaths for his victims, who are thinly disguised versions of various group members.  They put together an e-mail, send it out to their classmates, and sit back to watch the rumors spread.  Then, the things they made up start coming true and it appears there are games within games within games.It is not really fair to say that ""Cry Wolf"" stays a step ahead of you because the script by director Jeff Wadlow and his co-writer Beau Bauman knows how you are supposed to think when trying to figure out who is the serial killer and then they proceed to play with your mind.  They know that you are trying to eliminate suspects and that you worry more about opportunity rather than motive (movies like this either make the motive absolutely obvious from early on or seem to pull one out of a hat at the end to explain what made the killer do it), and you just cannot make things add up in this one.  It is like being halfway through a Sudoku puzzle and suddenly realizing you have two sevens in the same box and you cannot figure out how to backtrack to undo your mistake.The cast is filled with young actors and actresses who will be leaving behind good looking corpses and besides the old groundskeeper for most of the film the only adult on the premises is the journalism teacher (Jon Bon Jovi), who also knows something about playing chess (with an antique set no less).  There is not a lot of blood and gore in this one, and in some ways when we see the killer is the least interesting part of the film.  It is much more fun to watch the spoiled little rich kids all turn on each other.However, in the end I rounded up on this one becaue of the DVD extras, which includes Wadlow and Bauman's previous efforts, a pair of shorts from 2002.  ""Manual Labor"" is but a trifle, but ""The Tower of Babel"" gives us Earl, who is one of those billion chimps banging away on those million typewriters trying to write Shakespeare and the local weather report between now and the end of time.  You might find that things get too cute, but the gimmick is to have different situations with different characters in which the dialogue is the same but the contexts are, well, different.  It has its moments, thanks to Earl.",4,I think this one owes more to Agatha Christie than Earl the Chimp,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,4144,"['can', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'viewers', 'are', 'reminded', 'Cry', 'Wolf', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'cinematic', 'reference', 'point', 'was', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'movie', 'Saying', 'one', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'fortunately', 'are', 'several', 'such', 'movies', 'based', 'books', 'can', 'see', 'echoes', 'least', 'two', 'classics', 'one', 'Now', 'could', 'strike', 'good', 'news', 'like', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'mysteries', 'might', 'mean', 'have', 'be', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'why', 'pulling', 'old', 'tricks', 'hat', 'could', 'strike', 'younger', 'audience', 'being', 'new', 'might', 'be', 'offended', 'tried', 'trick', 'such', 'ways', 'genre', 'often', 'as', 'much', 'tricks', 'twists', 'blood', 'gore.Owen', 'Julian', 'Morris', 'up', 'rich', 'kids', 'boarding', 'school', 'having', 'been', 'kicked', 'more', 'share', 'such', 'places', 'first', 'person', 'Dodger', 'Lindy', 'Booth', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'leader', 'local', 'pack', 'one', 'whom', 'Owen', 'new', 'roommate', 'Tom', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'middle', 'first', 'night', 'Tom', 'wakes', 'Owen', 'up', 'church', 'campus', 'where', 'everybody', 'up', 'play', 'game', 'run', 'Dodger', 'do', 'figuring', 'out', 'who', 'telling', 'lies', 'who', 'not', 'making', 'much', 'distinction', 'wolves', 'sheep', 'shepherds', 'tossed', 'good', 'measure', 'game', 'be', 'relatively', 'easy', 'Owen', 'who', 'problem', 'taking', 'advantage', 'bunch', 'bored', 'rich', 'kids', 'Dodger', 'also', 'not', 'find', 'challenging', 'be', 'playing', 'chess', 'bunch', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'playing', 'checkers', 'two', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'game', 'group', 'will', 'be', 'wolves', 'rest', 'campus', 'will', 'be', 'sheep.So', 'decide', 'take', 'recent', 'murder', 'local', 'girl', 'spin', 'story', 'being', 'victim', 'serial', 'killer', 'known', 'Wolf', 'give', 'few', 'iconic', 'characteristics', 'big', 'knife', 'orange', 'ski', 'mask', 'come', 'up', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'victims', 'who', 'are', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'versions', 'various', 'group', 'members', 'put', 'together', 'e-mail', 'send', 'classmates', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'rumors', 'spread', 'Then', 'things', 'made', 'up', 'start', 'coming', 'true', 'are', 'games', 'games', 'games.It', 'not', 'really', 'fair', 'say', 'Cry', 'Wolf', 'step', 'ahead', 'script', 'director', 'Jeff', 'Wadlow', 'co-writer', 'Beau', 'Bauman', 'how', 'are', 'supposed', 'think', 'when', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'serial', 'killer', 'then', 'proceed', 'play', 'mind', 'know', 'are', 'trying', 'eliminate', 'suspects', 'worry', 'more', 'opportunity', 'rather', 'motive', 'movies', 'make', 'motive', 'absolutely', 'obvious', 'early', 'seem', 'pull', 'one', 'hat', 'end', 'explain', 'what', 'made', 'killer', 'do', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'things', 'add', 'up', 'one', 'being', 'halfway', 'Sudoku', 'puzzle', 'suddenly', 'realizing', 'have', 'two', 'sevens', 'same', 'box', 'can', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'backtrack', 'undo', 'mistake.The', 'cast', 'filled', 'young', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'leaving', 'good', 'looking', 'corpses', 'old', 'groundskeeper', 'most', 'film', 'only', 'adult', 'premises', 'journalism', 'teacher', 'Jon', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'who', 'also', 'something', 'playing', 'chess', 'antique', 'set', 'less', 'not', 'lot', 'blood', 'gore', 'one', 'ways', 'when', 'see', 'killer', 'least', 'interesting', 'part', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'spoiled', 'little', 'rich', 'kids', 'turn', 'other.However', 'end', 'rounded', 'up', 'one', 'becaue', 'DVD', 'extras', 'Wadlow', 'Bauman', 'previous', 'efforts', 'pair', 'shorts', '2002', 'Manual', 'Labor', 'trifle', 'Tower', 'Babel', 'Earl', 'who', 'one', 'billion', 'chimps', 'banging', 'away', 'million', 'typewriters', 'trying', 'write', 'Shakespeare', 'local', 'weather', 'report', 'now', 'end', 'time', 'might', 'find', 'things', 'get', 'too', 'cute', 'gimmick', 'have', 'different', 'situations', 'different', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'same', 'contexts', 'are', 'well', 'different', 'moments', 'thanks', 'Earl']",N/A
640374,ASSKHS3FV3J0H,B00005JOHF,"Lillian Patterson ""Post-Postmodern Angster""","[41, 47]","It's a little hard to believe that a group of high-school students get off on playing a childish game like the one at the beginning of this movie, but since I learned the similar game in college, I guess that lends an air of credibility. And I suppose the REAL thrill is sneaking out of their dorms late at night and meeting together and perhaps rich kids at prep schools like stroking their intellects by trying to outwit each other (I thought only college students did that?) Nevertheless, the atmosphere of this movie is so steeped in small-town ambience, the locations are so gorgeous, and the cast are so capable that honestly, no matter how silly or contrived anything in this movie gets, I ate it up. If you don't think you'd be swayed by those things, you'll probably pick out every flaw in this movie and you'll probably hate it and you probably shouldn't watch it. But if you're like me, the flaws will coast right over your head and you'll love every second of this movie even as you watch it over and over and over again.First off, I appreciated how these ""teens"" actually looked young. They're not the 30-something teens we see in many movies today. And their plights are laced with actual emotion. I cared about Dodger (Lindy Booth) and her familial situation and her teen girl angst, caught between selfish concerns and caring about others. I cared about Julian Morris's character, his absentee father who didn't deign to take his son's calls, and his desire to impress the girl he likes with arrogant displays of his intelligence. Every character here, from the token ethnic guy and his sweetly slutty girlfriend to the ""bad boy"" with the piercings, to the oafish roommate who's a slacker, felt real because they felt true. They didn't toe the line of the stereotypes they'd fit into if this were a grown-up slasher film. For instance, the ""slut"" flirts a lot but she doesn't actually put out, and she giggles with a sense of timid experimentation that rings true (she seems like an actual teenage girl going through actual teenage existence, she's not just a stock character). Plus she's an FX buff and she knows a lot about costumes and makeup-which is both why her friends consult her for help with costumes for the Halloween dance and why they don't immediately run to the authorities when blood starts showing up everywhere-it could conceivably just be a trick...couldn't it? I mean, she knows about makeup, one of them is an actor, the other is known for playing elaborate pranks, and they're ALL a bunch of liars. Everything is set up so it's hard to believe anything that happens, and it all takes place over the course of a few days, so there's no time to pause for reflection. There are tiny little nuances to every character that make the performances fun to watch and they also help further the plot. It's nice to see a story that fits together so well, where the filmmakers didn't get bored and decide to give up halfway through, which seems to be the case with a lot of movies.That's all in the beginning, though, and it lays the groundwork for something much bigger. Once the plot starts to thicken, the kids are shy at first then more and more daring as they contrive their plot. It becomes impossible to trust anything you see or hear, anything the characters say or do, because it seems that everyone could be lying about anything at any moment. That's the thing about this movie...every event seems layered, as though it could become connected to something else at some point in the story, and it makes you feel like you should be taking notes so you don't miss anything. There's a mystery within a mystery within a mystery and so many twists and twisted events that it had me on the edge of my seat until the very end. It's not that I was fooled by any of the twists because I refused to believe ANY of them, and withheld my judgment until the very end. And what an ending! Everything is tied up, there are no loose ends, and the conclusion doesn't suck ass like it did with certain OTHER movies (*cough*Hide and Seek*cough*).The Bottom Line: So I loved the performances, cared about the story (what happened) AND the plot (why it happened-the deeper meaning running beneath everything), and I wasn't let down by the ending. The scenery and setting were gorgeous, the old buildings added a sense of foreboding, I didn't trust any of the characters, there's a sleazy performance by John Bon Jovi who actually does a good turn as a teacher with a secret...what can I say? I watched it over and over again, and it holds up. It's fun. Judging by all the negative reviews, no one ELSE liked it, but I did.Overall: Oh yes, there won't be blood (it's Pg-13, duh) but there WILL be fun. 9/10",4,A Ton of Fun,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,4719,"['little', 'hard', 'believe', 'group', 'high-school', 'students', 'get', 'playing', 'childish', 'game', 'one', 'beginning', 'movie', 'learned', 'similar', 'game', 'college', 'guess', 'air', 'credibility', 'suppose', 'REAL', 'thrill', 'sneaking', 'dorms', 'late', 'night', 'meeting', 'together', 'perhaps', 'rich', 'kids', 'prep', 'schools', 'stroking', 'intellects', 'trying', 'outwit', 'other', 'thought', 'only', 'college', 'students', 'did', 'Nevertheless', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'so', 'steeped', 'small-town', 'ambience', 'locations', 'are', 'so', 'gorgeous', 'cast', 'are', 'so', 'capable', 'honestly', 'matter', 'how', 'silly', 'contrived', 'anything', 'movie', 'ate', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'swayed', 'things', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'pick', 'out', 'flaw', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'hate', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'watch', ""'re"", 'flaws', 'will', 'coast', 'right', 'head', ""'ll"", 'love', 'second', 'movie', 'even', 'watch', 'again.First', 'appreciated', 'how', 'teens', 'actually', 'looked', 'young', ""'re"", 'not', '30-something', 'teens', 'see', 'many', 'movies', 'today', 'plights', 'are', 'laced', 'actual', 'emotion', 'cared', 'Dodger', 'Lindy', 'Booth', 'familial', 'situation', 'teen', 'girl', 'angst', 'caught', 'selfish', 'concerns', 'caring', 'others', 'cared', 'Julian', 'Morris', 'character', 'absentee', 'father', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'deign', 'take', 'son', 'calls', 'desire', 'impress', 'girl', 'arrogant', 'displays', 'intelligence', 'character', 'here', 'token', 'ethnic', 'guy', 'sweetly', 'slutty', 'girlfriend', 'bad', 'boy', 'piercings', 'oafish', 'roommate', 'who', 'slacker', 'felt', 'real', 'felt', 'true', 'did', ""n't"", 'toe', 'line', 'stereotypes', ""'d"", 'fit', 'were', 'grown-up', 'slasher', 'film', 'instance', 'slut', 'lot', ""n't"", 'actually', 'put', 'out', 'sense', 'timid', 'experimentation', 'true', 'actual', 'teenage', 'girl', 'going', 'actual', 'teenage', 'existence', 'not', 'just', 'stock', 'character', 'FX', 'buff', 'lot', 'costumes', 'makeup-which', 'why', 'friends', 'consult', 'help', 'costumes', 'Halloween', 'dance', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'run', 'authorities', 'when', 'blood', 'showing', 'up', 'everywhere-it', 'could', 'conceivably', 'just', 'be', 'trick', 'could', ""n't"", 'mean', 'makeup', 'one', 'actor', 'other', 'known', 'playing', 'elaborate', 'pranks', ""'re"", 'bunch', 'liars', 'Everything', 'set', 'up', 'hard', 'believe', 'anything', 'place', 'course', 'few', 'days', 'time', 'pause', 'reflection', 'are', 'tiny', 'little', 'nuances', 'character', 'make', 'performances', 'fun', 'watch', 'also', 'help', 'further', 'plot', 'nice', 'see', 'story', 'together', 'so', 'well', 'where', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'decide', 'give', 'up', 'halfway', 'be', 'case', 'lot', 'movies.That', 'beginning', 'groundwork', 'something', 'much', 'bigger', 'plot', 'thicken', 'kids', 'are', 'shy', 'first', 'then', 'more', 'more', 'daring', 'contrive', 'plot', 'impossible', 'trust', 'anything', 'see', 'hear', 'anything', 'characters', 'say', 'do', 'everyone', 'could', 'be', 'lying', 'anything', 'moment', 'thing', 'movie', 'event', 'layered', 'could', 'become', 'connected', 'something', 'else', 'point', 'story', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'taking', 'notes', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything', 'mystery', 'mystery', 'mystery', 'so', 'many', 'twists', 'twisted', 'events', 'had', 'edge', 'seat', 'very', 'end', 'not', 'was', 'fooled', 'twists', 'refused', 'believe', 'ANY', 'withheld', 'judgment', 'very', 'end', 'what', 'ending', 'Everything', 'tied', 'up', 'are', 'loose', 'ends', 'conclusion', ""n't"", 'suck', 'ass', 'did', 'certain', 'OTHER', 'movies', '*cough*Hide', 'Seek*cough*', '.The', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'So', 'loved', 'performances', 'cared', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'plot', 'why', 'happened-the', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'running', 'everything', 'was', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'ending', 'scenery', 'setting', 'were', 'gorgeous', 'old', 'buildings', 'added', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'characters', 'sleazy', 'performance', 'John', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'who', 'actually', 'good', 'turn', 'teacher', 'secret', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'up', 'fun', 'Judging', 'negative', 'reviews', 'one', 'ELSE', 'liked', 'did.Overall', 'Oh', 'yes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'blood', 'Pg-13', 'duh', 'WILL', 'be', 'fun', '9/10']",N/A

I expected it to be a silly teen slasher movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.  (It's great to be a pessimist...you're either proven right or pleasantly surprised).  It it quite possible that I am simply too gullible; however, I was kept guessing until the very end.When I say ""WONDERFUL movie, Little Diamond in the Rough,"" I'm not talking about a potential Oscar-winner.

Buy Hostel or Ichi the Killer instead (also great movies!).If you want something to really scare the living daylights out of you, then I also do not suggest this movie -- get Session 9 or Ju-On or Ringu (or, alternatively, in the case of the latter two, their American counterparts, The Grudge and The Ring).  This movie is great, but it won't leave you sleeping with the lights on.If you are a TRUE horror fan, however (or if you just like good suspense movies without the gore) -- do not hesitate to get Cry Wolf.

640380,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B00005JOHF,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[3, 5]","""Cry_Wolf"" is director Jeff Wadlow's first film and it many ways it shows: an over-eager sensibility permeates the simple story of a murderer on the loose at a ritzy boarding school. Like many novice directors, Bauman is eager to show us all that he has learned his entire life about making films and this is especially apparent in the frenzied editing and lack of focus of the screenplay: several of the key scenes lack forward propulsion because the words stop them dead in their tracks.One thing that Bauman has right, though is the production, all phases of which: camera, lighting, mood are right spot on. This film is gorgeous with Bauman favoring the deep dark rich colors over pastels which perfectly set and hold the scenes and the action that unfolds.Also, though we've seen the plot of this film many times, Wadlow and writer Beau Bauman manage to come up with a few good plot twists though the big surprise ending would have had more effect if the editing had been tighter.The acting is okay to good with the veterans like Anna Deavere Smith (in too brief a performance) and Gary Cole coming off best.""Cry_Wolf"" is a good film but it could have been better.

Director Jeff Wadlow uses his camera quite effectively and I found its plot twists rather convincing and intriguing.  A newcomer (British Julian Morris) to a prep school finds himself involved in a game with fellow students led by the sultry Dodger (Lindy Booth in a slinky, ominous performance).  When a young ""townie"" girl is found murdered in the woods, the kids decide to send an e-mail creating a hoax killer called the Wolf.  Things spiral out of control when it seems the killer is real and is targeting the game players for extinction.  The script features a lot of red herrings and the mood is creepy throughout.  Jon Bon Jovi plays the journalism teacher and Gary Cole has a brief role as Owen's insensitive, but wealthy, father.  While the movie has some of the cliches expected in a slasher movie, its execution is refreshingly original and the acting is above average.

O'Blenis,"[1, 3]","I went into ""Cry_Wolf"" without much advance knowledge, hoping perhaps for something in the general ""Halloween""/""Friday The 13th"" vein (movies that I love) but anticipating that it may well be more in the line of the somewhat lighter, often at least partially self-parodying, run of horror movies that followed ""Scream"" in the late 90s and that I was never all that into.  It turned out to fall into neither category, landing instead on the mystery/suspense end of the spectrum.  It does retain elements of both aforementioned veins, particularly the former.  Of the latter, it's probably closest to something like ""Urban Legend"", which I though was among the better of its breed.  There is some humor present, but it's not a parody, of itself or of anything else.  The combination of the different veins resulted in one of moviedom's most pleasant surprises of 2005, a grand horror thriller that's sexy, engagingly suspenseful and cooly unpredictable.Set in a posh private high school and centering on a group of friends who gather at night to engage in games of guessing, bluffing and deciphering, the 'Wolf' of the title is a fictitious creation of the group, at least at first.  The players come up with him when they try to hoax the entire campus with fake emails revealing phony information that a recent, and seemingly random, murder in the woods outside town is the work of a serial killer called the Wolf, who moves from campus to campus across the country, beginning each reign of terror with the killing of a town citizen before setting in on the student population.  The movie passes its biggest hurdle in that, despite the idiocy and bad taste of the kids using a real murder as the basis for their little joke, they surprisingly don't all come off as a bunch of highly unlikable schmucks who you don't care what happens to.  A real figure matching the description of their invented 'Wolf' shows up - or does he? - and begins terrorizing certain members of the clique - or are they only pretending to be stalked to hoax their other friends?  Keeps you guessing right through, with an ingenious ending that, in my view, can be taken either of two ways with equal credibility.

Cry Wolf focuses on a group of high school students at a prep school. They play a game that involves lies and trying to get others to take the bait of those lies. But the group wants to take the game to the next level and use the whole school as a playing ground for this game. A local woman is found murdered in the woods, and the group decides this is the perfect basis for their lies. They send out an email warning of ""The Wolf"" who is supposedly responsible for this heinous murder and isn't going to stop with one. But soon it's hard to tell what's truth and what's lies.

640402,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005JOHF,trebe,"[0, 0]","Set at boarding school, and opening with a murder in the woods, you might expect Cry_Wolf (2005) to be your typical slasher, but the movie evolves into more of a suspense thriller, with the kills few and far between.  The film is about misdirection, and how well you like it may depend on how much you buy into the story.  Co-writer/director Jeff Wadlow used the million dollars he won in a film festival, to fund the production of the movie.Owen Matthews (Julian Morris), a new arrival from Britain, has enrolled in Westlake Preparatory Academy.  Rooming with Tom (Jared Padalecki), he quickly becomes involved in a game called `cry wolf' with a small group of students.  Played in the school's chapel, the game involves those who are selected as `wolves' trying to deceive the other players, as people are eliminated from the game, until just one person remains.  The recent murder of a young woman, sparks the idea of extending their private make believe game, into a very real and public arena.  The students, led by Matthews and Dodger Allen (Lindy Booth), blame the murder on a fictional killer who wears an orange mask and a camo jacket.  They send an email purportedly from the killer, to the student body, which quickly spreads everywhere.The group enjoys the stir they have created, and when Owen gets an IM from someone called ""Wolf"", he thinks that one of his fellow players is playing a prank.  Owen suspects several people, but can't find any proof.  Things get really serious, when Owen discovers a knife in his backpack, and resorts to blackmailing his instructor Mr. Walker (Jon Bon Jovi), who is apparently in some kind of romance with Dodger, to avoid being expelled.The stakes are raised higher on Halloween night, when while working in the cafeteria, Owen is attacked by an orange masked figure, wielding a knife.  The story features a number of twists, and the suspense continues to build up, until the situation finally explodes in the final act.  At the end, the film connects some dots, that when strung together, point to a solution that may satisfy some, but not everyone, as the film may not exactly play fair.Cry_Wolf leads you in one direction, and then strikes at a different point of attack.  Attempting to be clever, it's not always smoothly executed.  The lack of action in the middle section, tends to makes you impatient, so that when something finally happens, it's easy to just take events at face value.  With the focus on Owen, not that much is revealed about the relationships between the other characters, which turns out to be one of the keys to what happens.  This is the kind of film that bears a second viewing, to see if you can fill in the gaps, and find pointers to the final outcome.Lindy Booth (Relic Hunter) is excellent, as for a change she has a role with some real substance, and her character lasts till the end of a movie.  The acting is generally good, and Julian Morris gives a convincing performance, although feeling sorry for Owen might be a little tough, as he's pretty irritating, kind of a whiner, and is played like a violin by his new ""friends"".The DVD has a number of solid extras, and a rather thoughtful commentary track featuring Jeff Wadlow, co-writer Beau Bauman, and associate producer Seth Gordon.  Slick and complex, Cry_Wolf is more of a suspense thriller, rather than a slasher flick, which may be disappointing to some.",3,played like a violin...,1313280000,"08 14, 2011",2011,3398,"['Set', 'boarding', 'school', 'opening', 'murder', 'woods', 'might', 'expect', 'Cry_Wolf', '2005', 'be', 'typical', 'slasher', 'movie', 'more', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'kills', 'few', 'far', 'film', 'misdirection', 'how', 'well', 'may', 'depend', 'how', 'much', 'buy', 'story', 'Co-writer/director', 'Jeff', 'Wadlow', 'used', 'million', 'dollars', 'won', 'film', 'festival', 'fund', 'production', 'movie.Owen', 'Matthews', 'Julian', 'Morris', 'new', 'arrival', 'Britain', 'enrolled', 'Westlake', 'Preparatory', 'Academy', 'Rooming', 'Tom', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'quickly', 'involved', 'game', 'called', 'cry', 'wolf', 'small', 'group', 'students', 'Played', 'school', 'chapel', 'game', 'who', 'are', 'selected', 'wolves', 'trying', 'deceive', 'other', 'players', 'people', 'are', 'eliminated', 'game', 'just', 'one', 'person', 'recent', 'murder', 'young', 'woman', 'idea', 'extending', 'private', 'make', 'believe', 'game', 'very', 'real', 'public', 'arena', 'students', 'led', 'Matthews', 'Dodger', 'Allen', 'Lindy', 'Booth', 'blame', 'murder', 'fictional', 'killer', 'who', 'orange', 'mask', 'camo', 'jacket', 'send', 'email', 'purportedly', 'killer', 'student', 'body', 'quickly', 'everywhere.The', 'group', 'stir', 'have', 'created', 'when', 'Owen', 'IM', 'someone', 'called', 'Wolf', 'one', 'fellow', 'players', 'playing', 'prank', 'Owen', 'several', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'proof', 'Things', 'get', 'really', 'serious', 'when', 'Owen', 'knife', 'backpack', 'resorts', 'blackmailing', 'instructor', 'Mr.', 'Walker', 'Jon', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'who', 'apparently', 'kind', 'romance', 'Dodger', 'avoid', 'being', 'expelled.The', 'stakes', 'are', 'raised', 'higher', 'Halloween', 'night', 'when', 'working', 'cafeteria', 'Owen', 'attacked', 'orange', 'masked', 'figure', 'wielding', 'knife', 'story', 'number', 'twists', 'suspense', 'build', 'up', 'situation', 'finally', 'final', 'act', 'end', 'film', 'dots', 'when', 'strung', 'together', 'point', 'solution', 'may', 'satisfy', 'not', 'everyone', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'exactly', 'play', 'fair.Cry_Wolf', 'one', 'direction', 'then', 'strikes', 'different', 'point', 'attack', 'Attempting', 'be', 'clever', 'not', 'always', 'smoothly', 'executed', 'lack', 'action', 'middle', 'section', 'impatient', 'so', 'when', 'something', 'finally', 'easy', 'just', 'take', 'events', 'face', 'value', 'focus', 'Owen', 'not', 'much', 'revealed', 'relationships', 'other', 'characters', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'keys', 'what', 'kind', 'film', 'second', 'viewing', 'see', 'can', 'fill', 'gaps', 'find', 'pointers', 'final', 'outcome.Lindy', 'Booth', 'Relic', 'Hunter', 'excellent', 'change', 'role', 'real', 'substance', 'character', 'lasts', 'till', 'end', 'movie', 'acting', 'generally', 'good', 'Julian', 'Morris', 'convincing', 'performance', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'Owen', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'tough', 'pretty', 'irritating', 'kind', 'whiner', 'played', 'violin', 'new', 'friends', '.The', 'DVD', 'number', 'solid', 'extras', 'rather', 'thoughtful', 'commentary', 'track', 'featuring', 'Jeff', 'Wadlow', 'co-writer', 'Beau', 'Bauman', 'associate', 'producer', 'Seth', 'Gordon', 'Slick', 'complex', 'Cry_Wolf', 'more', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'rather', 'slasher', 'flick', 'may', 'be', 'disappointing']",N/A

A new guy (Julian Morris) moves into a posh-prep school in a small town somewhere (presumably in the northeast U.S.).  He has a difficult time fitting in until he meets a band of like-minded students who like to sneak out of their rooms and play complex games at night.  After a young local woman is found murdered this group of students decides to further the scare through spreading online rumors about a serial killer called ""The Wolf"".  The students begin an urban legend of their own creation describing who The Wolf's next victims will be.  The goal is to see how fast and far the rumor will spread and to see if anyone can uncover the truth.  But then the described victims actually start turning up dead and no one appears to know the difference between the truth and a lie.CRY WOLF was marketed and is usually labeled as a horror film, but the movie is not a horror movie.  Other than a few droplets, there is no blood.  The body count is low and the film really isn't designed for a sequel.  The movie uses images, techniques, and clich&eacute;s of the horror genre to help build suspense, but CRY WOLF is actually a teen mystery/suspense-thriller.The cast does a good job of pulling of the things they need to pull of in the film.  Though they appear younger than the casts of many teen movies, these ""kids"" are all in their twenties.  It makes one wonder if someone will ever make a movie about high school students that actually has high school students as actors.Though the movie doesn't set any new boundaries, I enjoyed CRY WOLF and found it to be a better movie than I expected it to be.  Writer and director Jeff Wadlow and co-writer Beau Bauman must have drenched themselves in urban legends and teen horror pictures, because they do an excellent job of capturing the clich&eacute;s of the genre, then turning them inside-out.  Very few of the characters who appear in CRY WOLF are who they act and seem to be.  The game the students play is an in-depth one and before the end it's very difficult to figure out who's not crying wolf.CRY WOLF is a good film from a group of young filmmakers.  I look forward to seeing what they will come out with next.  Fans of horror movies might not like this movie because there isn't any gore, but fans of suspense, thriller, and teen pictures will probably enjoy it.

Freeman ""Zach""","[0, 0]","I have to admit that my expectations were set very low by the title, the trailer, the DVD cover, the unknown cast, and even by reading the description of the film on the box, but Cry_Wolf turned out to be a really clever, well-made slasher film.Cry_Wolf takes the teen slasher model of a horror film and mixes it up a bit, with very successful results. Director Jeff Wadlow managed to make a polished, well-acted, suspenseful horror film on a very low budget with prize money from The Chrysler Million Dollar Film Festival, which Wadlow won (all this is in the special features).With a cast of unknown actors, who all manage to create thoroughly believable characters, Cry_Wolf moves along relatively quickly, and also manages to make a situation that might seem unrealistic into a believable thriller.  Gore is substituted for genuine suspense and plot.When a new kid shows up at an elite boarding school, he's introduced to a game a group of friends loves to play. One person is the Wolf, and the rest are Sheep. The Wolf has to manage to convince everyone else that they are a sheep, while the sheep try to figure out who the wolf is. After a murder takes place in the woods, the group decides to expand their game to include the entire student body: creating a fabricated email forward describing a copycat serial killer who is now loose on campus. Unfortunately, someone is taking the game a little too seriously. Through twists and turns in the plot, the kids try to figure out who the real Wolf is before he gets to them.The special featurs include casting tapes from every character, which is a very interesting addition and helps audience members see why each actor was cast. There's also a making of featurette that includes stunt-work, costume, set design, and reveals that many different crew members got to play the Wolf in different scenes. Also included are two short films by director Jeff Wadlow, Tower of Babble and Manual Labor.
