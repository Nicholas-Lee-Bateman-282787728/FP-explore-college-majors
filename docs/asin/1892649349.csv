195519,A141HP4LYPWMSR,1892649349,Brian E. Erland,"[0, 0]","Note: Film presented in Danish and Greenlandic with English subtitles.Introduction: The 1998 film `Heart of Light' is a tale too often told concerning the destructive effects that occur within an indigenous culture when their traditional way of life, beliefs and language are replaced by the inevitable onslaught of modernity. This time the people and location is the frozen north, more precisely amongst the Inuit people of Greenland.With the arrival of the Danes in 1947 the old ways are quickly replaced by the more modern lifestyle of the Danish culture. The nomadic lifestyle on the frozen tundra is no more, the Inuit now reside in government subsidized communities, attend Christian churches and are educated in European style schools. Only the old people continue to cling to the native tongue and sing the songs of Greenland when gathered together. As in all cases of assimilation and absorption into another way of life it is the young who are the easiest to win over, they embrace the Danish language and contemporary music further distancing themselves from their elders. Even the joy of hunting, what was once the essential ingredient to their way of life has now been usurped by community bingo.Time and again history has taught us that there are harsh ramifications to dissolving the basics of one culture and replacing it with another. The ensuing loss of identity, purpose and self worth that follow such actions are devastating. The void created must be filled by something else and rampant alcoholism is generally the remedy of choice, a solution which always leads to even further alienation and disintegration within the community.Synopsis: In `Heart of Light' we are introduced to Rasmus, a middle aged married Inuit with two twenty something sons. Though good natured and likeable, he is also the town drunk who seems to embarrass his family at every turn. When he isn't drinking his mind is on hunting, the last vestige of the old ways by which he believes he may be able to find redemption in the eyes of family, community and most importantly with himself. Unfortunately every time he travels out into the icy tundra for one reason or another he always returns empty handed.As Rasmus descends deeper and deeper into his alcoholic depression problems in the family escalate until tragic consequences finally force him to realize he must change or lose himself and family forever. Does the answer he seeks lie out there somewhere in the ice and snow? Will one more hunting trip lead to enlightenment, redemption and restoration? For better or worse a journey into the heart of Greenland awaits.Critique: `Heart of Light' is as the title states a story filled with heart. Its message is simply told and emotional delivered while successfully avoiding the trap of coming across as contrived and preachy. The soundtrack is captivating as is the beautiful visuals of the harsh, expansive landscape of Greenland.There is a not so subtle shift from mundane realism to tribal mysticism that takes place during Rasmus solitary journey. It is a change of perspective that the viewer may not have expected. It occurs when our intrepid traveler encounters an eccentric hermit who attempts to offer lessons in life in exchange for food. While the mystical insights gained by Rasmus serve to fill in some of the missing pieces of the storyline and provide depth to his character I'm not sure the majority of the audience would appreciate their addition. They did however work for me.What really sets this film apart for me is the magnificent performance by Rasmus Lyberth in the lead role. His ability to convey such emotional angst in his countenance is nothing short of amazing. Anger, frustration, drunkenness and loss are truly become visceral experiences to the viewer. However his talent to convey the human emotions is not limited to one side of the spectrum. Feelings of love, joy and understanding come across the screen just as powerful, just as real to such a degree that the audience can only wonder if we are watching a performance or a real life lived out before us?

195520,A1TZSL7WPZRVMB,1892649349,"cdswatch ""cdswatch""","[5, 7]","I might have picked out Heart of Light for the wrong reason.  The first thing mentioned in every review for this movie is Greenland.  I do not intend to offend with the following: I have to admit that the mere mention of Greenland seems enough to conjure up the image of the end of the world (physically so).  I thought it nice to check out the land that I have very seldom heard about, let alone view.I was not terribly dissapointed with this film but neither was I overly impressed.  The cinematography is first-class, capturing the stark beauty of the barren ice land.  The story is thematically deep and intense, about a father whose son murder a couple of people, including his brother's lover, and then kill himself after not being able to stand the ridicules unleashed on his anachronistic father.  The father would take a journey to the deep terrain of Greenland in search for forgiveness and understanding of his life.  During this journey, he would meet a hermit who shows him a glimpse of his own father's life and ultimately his peace of mind.To cover such a deep territory of soul-searching in such short a time is not a task enviable.  A lot of things have to be established for the audience to serve as an involved observer.  There lies the biggest flaw of the movie, it fails to adequately present the ever important segments: the who's and why's.  Even the motive for the murders is hardly convincing as it takes place early in the film; not enough information about the son and the relationship with his father is provided in the rest of the movie.  Even the father cuts a shadowy figure in the entire movie, lost in the effort to tell a deeper and complicated story about a man in search of his soul.This film is certainly ambitious and could have been an epic that carries a universal appeal.  However, the first things are definitely not first in this movie.  The rule is simple: to identify with someone, you would have to at least know someone.  The director seems too busy planning to get to the home base that not all bases are covered.  As a result, it remains as a movie that stares greatness in the eye but walks away empty-handed.",3,Interesting but overachieving,1006041600,"11 18, 2001",2001,2159,"['might', 'have', 'picked', 'out', 'Heart', 'Light', 'wrong', 'reason', 'first', 'thing', 'mentioned', 'review', 'movie', 'Greenland', 'do', 'not', 'intend', 'offend', 'following', 'have', 'admit', 'mere', 'mention', 'Greenland', 'enough', 'conjure', 'up', 'image', 'end', 'world', 'physically', 'so', 'thought', 'nice', 'check', 'out', 'land', 'have', 'very', 'seldom', 'heard', 'let', 'alone', 'view.I', 'was', 'not', 'terribly', 'dissapointed', 'film', 'was', 'overly', 'impressed', 'cinematography', 'first-class', 'capturing', 'stark', 'beauty', 'barren', 'ice', 'land', 'story', 'thematically', 'deep', 'intense', 'father', 'son', 'murder', 'couple', 'people', 'including', 'brother', 'lover', 'then', 'kill', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'stand', 'ridicules', 'unleashed', 'anachronistic', 'father', 'father', 'would', 'take', 'journey', 'deep', 'terrain', 'Greenland', 'search', 'forgiveness', 'understanding', 'life', 'journey', 'would', 'meet', 'hermit', 'who', 'glimpse', 'own', 'father', 'life', 'ultimately', 'peace', 'mind.To', 'cover', 'deep', 'territory', 'soul-searching', 'such', 'short', 'time', 'not', 'task', 'enviable', 'lot', 'things', 'have', 'be', 'established', 'audience', 'serve', 'involved', 'observer', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'movie', 'adequately', 'present', 'ever', 'important', 'segments', 'who', 'why', 'Even', 'motive', 'murders', 'hardly', 'convincing', 'place', 'early', 'film', 'not', 'information', 'son', 'relationship', 'father', 'provided', 'rest', 'movie', 'Even', 'father', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'entire', 'movie', 'lost', 'effort', 'tell', 'deeper', 'complicated', 'story', 'man', 'search', 'soul.This', 'film', 'certainly', 'ambitious', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'epic', 'universal', 'appeal', 'However', 'first', 'things', 'are', 'definitely', 'not', 'first', 'movie', 'rule', 'simple', 'identify', 'someone', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'know', 'someone', 'director', 'too', 'busy', 'planning', 'get', 'home', 'base', 'not', 'bases', 'are', 'covered', 'result', 'movie', 'greatness', 'eye', 'away', 'empty-handed']",N/A
195521,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,1892649349,Linda Linguvic,"[11, 11]","Filmed in the Greenlander Inuit language, this 1998 film works on two levels - realism and myth.Native Greenlanders who were colonized by Denmark in 1947.  Now, fifty years later, their culture has been marginalized by alcoholism.  Rasmuth is typical of his people.  He drinks too much and embarrasses his family.  And when he tries to go hunting, he doesn't even have the proper clothing.  One of his teenage sons has drifted into the mainstream culture and despises him.  The other son has a mental breakdown and goes on a murderous rampage before turning the gun on himself.  Rasmuth is shamed beyond belief, and goes on a journey into the heart of the frozen world to redeem himself.  Along the way he meets a hermit who helps him on his quest.  This is where the film turns mythic.Usually I don't like films that bend reality.  But this film was different because it was told from inside the Inuit culture.  The acting was of high quality.  And the cinematography was excellent.  I felt I was picked up and put down in a world I know little about.  And when the film was over, I knew that my own life was enriched because of it.  I didn't even mind the slightly uneven pacing.  I therefore highly recommend this film for anyone who doesn't mind a bit of sadness and is willing to learn about a way of life outside our everyday world.",5,Placed me inside of Intuit culture and enriched my life.,1076803200,"02 15, 2004",2004,1338,"['Filmed', 'Greenlander', 'Inuit', 'language', '1998', 'film', 'works', 'two', 'levels', 'realism', 'myth.Native', 'Greenlanders', 'who', 'were', 'colonized', 'Denmark', '1947', 'Now', 'fifty', 'years', 'later', 'culture', 'been', 'marginalized', 'alcoholism', 'Rasmuth', 'typical', 'people', 'too', 'much', 'family', 'when', 'go', 'hunting', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'proper', 'clothing', 'One', 'teenage', 'sons', 'drifted', 'mainstream', 'culture', 'other', 'son', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'murderous', 'rampage', 'turning', 'gun', 'Rasmuth', 'shamed', 'belief', 'journey', 'heart', 'frozen', 'world', 'redeem', 'way', 'hermit', 'who', 'quest', 'where', 'film', 'mythic.Usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'films', 'bend', 'reality', 'film', 'was', 'different', 'was', 'told', 'Inuit', 'culture', 'acting', 'was', 'high', 'quality', 'cinematography', 'was', 'excellent', 'felt', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'put', 'down', 'world', 'know', 'little', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'knew', 'own', 'life', 'was', 'enriched', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'mind', 'slightly', 'uneven', 'pacing', 'therefore', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'mind', 'bit', 'sadness', 'willing', 'learn', 'way', 'life', 'everyday', 'world']",N/A

An Inuit man, corrupted by European influences, searches for his past and finds it with the help of a qivittog--a mythic trickster figure with special powers.
