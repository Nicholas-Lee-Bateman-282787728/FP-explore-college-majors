To paraphrase Elizabeth B. Browning: ""How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways.""1.) The same parched countryside stands in for both Eastern Russia and Southern France.2.) The invasion ""force"" of a dozen men during the big D-Day scene arrives in two rusty LSTs. Behind them is an empty ocean.3.) One Allied plane flies overhead. That lone aircraft reappears in later scenes.4.) A bunker artillery piece sits frozen while hand-drawn smoke around its muzzle lamely suggests this gun has fired.5.) We see many die yet there's no blood. Not a drop. Probably wasn't in the so-called budget.6.) The female lead's lips are lumpily distorted with a half-pound of collagen. She wears a mid-thigh length skirt in a below-the-knee era.7.) This ""nurse"" looks and acts like a reject from Dial-a-Tramp.8.) Is that a '75 VW painted in camouflage khaki?9.) No explanation for why Field Marshal Rommel relies on the strategic advice of an obscure captain wounded by a grenade in Russia.10.) Did they REALLY end this stupid movie that way? Talk about a hackneyed plot device, almost as weak as: ""I woke up. It was all a dream.""BONUS REGRET:11.) I was wide awake the whole time.

1535191,AZGB4PG287IA2,B007NZDF70,Joe in California,"[0, 0]","I enjoy military action movies and consider myself a bit of a buff, but other than being impressed at several of what appeared to be original WWII armored vehicles and other military equipment, I was disappointed overall with the film.  The acting left much to be desired, and the over-inflated lips of the lead actress was a negative throughout the film. Her lower lip in particular appeared to be an example of over-done collagen or other cosmetic surgery; her mini-skirt nurse outfit was ridiculous considering the era; her too-red lipstick in every scene was a joke; and I had to wonder if she was the girlfriend of the producer and perhaps that is why she got this role. It quickly became apparent that the equipment and soldiers were courtesy of re-enactment groups, considering that some drivers had white hair and appeared to be in their 60s or 70s; likewise for some of the infantry.  Also distracting were the huge (actually fat) American infantrymen and officers sprinkled throughout the film.  No offense meant to the re-enactors, because I do respect what they do, but to be honest this affected the look of what is supposed to be a commercial film.  Also jarring were the tanks or other vehicles that were destroyed in one scene, yet the same vehicle, now portraying another vehicle, would immediately be back in action and coming from another direction.  It would have been better to paint over the large number on the tank turret, for example, or CGI it so it was not so painfully obvious the same vehicles were appearing over and over as ""different"" vehicles. The D-Day beach landing was also of the most miniscule scope I have ever seen in a movie.  Empty ocean behind the couple of landing craft, fairly quiet sound effects and very tightly shot on the small number of invading soldiers.  It was okay to watch this movie one time, but I have to say this was the first military drama that I have ever periodically dozed off while watching.  Eliminate some of the scenes with too much dialogue, shorten the film a bit, and the pace would pick up and be more watchable.",1,"Okay to Rent, But Don't Expect a Lot",1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,2085,"['enjoy', 'military', 'action', 'movies', 'consider', 'bit', 'buff', 'other', 'being', 'impressed', 'several', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'original', 'WWII', 'armored', 'vehicles', 'other', 'military', 'equipment', 'was', 'disappointed', 'overall', 'film', 'acting', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'over-inflated', 'lips', 'lead', 'actress', 'was', 'negative', 'film', 'lower', 'lip', 'particular', 'appeared', 'be', 'example', 'over-done', 'collagen', 'other', 'cosmetic', 'surgery', 'mini-skirt', 'nurse', 'outfit', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'considering', 'era', 'too-red', 'lipstick', 'scene', 'was', 'joke', 'had', 'wonder', 'was', 'girlfriend', 'producer', 'perhaps', 'why', 'got', 'role', 'quickly', 'became', 'apparent', 'equipment', 'soldiers', 'were', 'courtesy', 're-enactment', 'groups', 'considering', 'drivers', 'had', 'white', 'hair', 'appeared', 'be', '60s', '70s', 'likewise', 'infantry', 'Also', 'distracting', 'were', 'huge', 'actually', 'fat', 'American', 'infantrymen', 'officers', 'sprinkled', 'film', 'offense', 'meant', 're-enactors', 'do', 'respect', 'what', 'do', 'be', 'honest', 'affected', 'look', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'commercial', 'film', 'Also', 'jarring', 'were', 'tanks', 'other', 'vehicles', 'were', 'destroyed', 'one', 'scene', 'yet', 'same', 'vehicle', 'now', 'portraying', 'vehicle', 'would', 'immediately', 'be', 'back', 'action', 'coming', 'direction', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'paint', 'large', 'number', 'tank', 'turret', 'example', 'CGI', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'same', 'vehicles', 'were', 'appearing', 'different', 'vehicles', 'D-Day', 'beach', 'landing', 'was', 'also', 'most', 'miniscule', 'scope', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'Empty', 'ocean', 'couple', 'landing', 'craft', 'fairly', 'quiet', 'sound', 'effects', 'very', 'tightly', 'shot', 'small', 'number', 'invading', 'soldiers', 'was', 'okay', 'watch', 'movie', 'one', 'time', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'first', 'military', 'drama', 'have', 'ever', 'periodically', 'dozed', 'off', 'watching', 'Eliminate', 'scenes', 'too', 'much', 'dialogue', 'shorten', 'film', 'bit', 'pace', 'would', 'pick', 'up', 'be', 'more', 'watchable']",N/A

As the film opened, while it was obvious that money was saved on the lighting and camera's, I had some reasonable hopes due to the production using some pretty authentic equipment(no Pattons, Pershing, or Walker tanks marked with iron crosses here), but it quickly became apparent that there were other things that were skimped on. In the opening few scenes, it became obvious that the main character was unfamiliar with how to shoot a Walther P-38 and was scared of the recoil. Then, when a party of Red Army soldiers attacks a German postioon, the Russian party shows an older man in the lead. He is promptly killed off, but as the Reds counterattack, the ""dead"" older soldier is miraculously resurrected.....""Hallelujah!, And them Godless Commies always said there's no God!!""After the ""hero"" is wounded, and rescued by a relief force, the scene then shifts to the coast of ""Normandy"", where the hero meets his old lover, a Wehrmacht nurse played by Claudia Crawford(in her very first movie role). The ""hero"" wangles a way to meet with his ex-amour, and we are treated to Miss Crawford in a mini-skirt that's about 8"" above the knee(in occupied France in 1944??), and then a ""romantic"" interlude in a storage closet that is straight out of the film catalog of Jackie Treehorn and Karl Hungus. It's blocked & shot like a porno, which seems really fitting, since Miss Crawford looks and emotes like a trailer-trash Angelina Jolie. (BIG NEWS- Tino Struckman and Clod-ia Crawford also team up inChained: Code 207. Struckman is attempting to become the Ed Wood of action flicks!!)After spending 10 or 15 minutes researching this movie, I found it seems to have been shot using a number of WWII reenactors, mostly in Tennessee, and the executive producers said they would donate part of their profits to a Wounded Warrior fund. 1) These ""reenactors"" need to remove ""actor"" from that term 2) The executive producers will donate part of their ""profits""? Profit means the money they clear above their investment.....there won't be much of that, but it sounds good.This is a waste of time. The reenactors should stick to filming their weekend warring for home use, and not subject the rest of us to it. This dog is reminiscent of the terrible bookGrandfather's Tale: The Tale of a German Sniper, but at least this movie was more accurate in its usage of weapons, vehicles, and equipment.",1,"Terrible plot, acting, lighting, and photography",1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,2537,"['spotted', 'RedBox', 'website', 'yesterday', 'uttered', 'immortal', 'words', 'How', 'bad', 'can', 'be', '.I', 'am', 'here', 'tell', 'can', 'get', 'very', 'very', 'bad', 'film', 'opened', 'was', 'obvious', 'money', 'was', 'saved', 'lighting', 'camera', 'had', 'reasonable', 'hopes', 'due', 'production', 'using', 'pretty', 'authentic', 'equipment', 'Pattons', 'Pershing', 'Walker', 'tanks', 'marked', 'iron', 'crosses', 'here', 'quickly', 'became', 'apparent', 'were', 'other', 'things', 'were', 'skimped', 'opening', 'few', 'scenes', 'became', 'obvious', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'unfamiliar', 'how', 'shoot', 'Walther', 'P-38', 'was', 'scared', 'recoil', 'Then', 'when', 'party', 'Red', 'Army', 'soldiers', 'German', 'postioon', 'Russian', 'party', 'older', 'man', 'lead', 'promptly', 'killed', 'off', 'Reds', 'counterattack', 'dead', 'older', 'soldier', 'miraculously', 'resurrected', '..', 'Hallelujah', 'Godless', 'Commies', 'always', 'said', 'God', 'hero', 'wounded', 'rescued', 'relief', 'force', 'scene', 'then', 'coast', 'Normandy', 'where', 'hero', 'old', 'lover', 'Wehrmacht', 'nurse', 'played', 'Claudia', 'Crawford', 'very', 'first', 'movie', 'role', 'hero', 'way', 'meet', 'ex-amour', 'are', 'treated', 'Miss', 'Crawford', 'mini-skirt', '8', 'knee', 'occupied', 'France', '1944', 'then', 'romantic', 'interlude', 'storage', 'closet', 'straight', 'film', 'catalog', 'Jackie', 'Treehorn', 'Karl', 'Hungus', 'blocked', 'shot', 'porno', 'really', 'fitting', 'Miss', 'Crawford', 'trailer-trash', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'BIG', 'NEWS-', 'Tino', 'Struckman', 'Clod-ia', 'Crawford', 'also', 'up', 'inChained', 'Code', '207', 'Struckman', 'attempting', 'become', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'action', 'flicks', 'spending', '10', '15', 'minutes', 'researching', 'movie', 'found', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'using', 'number', 'WWII', 'reenactors', 'mostly', 'Tennessee', 'executive', 'producers', 'said', 'would', 'donate', 'part', 'profits', 'Wounded', 'Warrior', 'fund', '1', 'reenactors', 'need', 'remove', 'actor', 'term', '2', 'executive', 'producers', 'will', 'donate', 'part', 'profits', 'Profit', 'money', 'clear', 'investment', '..there', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'good.This', 'waste', 'time', 'reenactors', 'should', 'stick', 'filming', 'weekend', 'warring', 'home', 'use', 'not', 'subject', 'rest', 'dog', 'reminiscent', 'terrible', 'bookGrandfather', 'Tale', 'Tale', 'German', 'Sniper', 'least', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'accurate', 'usage', 'weapons', 'vehicles', 'equipment']",N/A

Well it's a turkey of gargantuan proportions and has been released under three different titles; one is this fiasco, another is called `Red Rose of Normandy' and also just `Normandy'. It is allegedly about Klaus who is a `good Nazi' and a veteran of the Eastern front. He is in love with Klaudia who is a nurse in France. He has a pathetic battle with some very old and overweight Russians and then goes to Normandy to advise Field Marshall Erwin Rommel on how to improve the Atlantic Wall, - yeah right Germany's best tactical genius  is going to listen to some Captain.The Russians apart from being crud at everything also have clean uniforms as do the Germans. There is some sub plot about making an heroic final stand to protect the wounded. The hospital is a tent with six bloke's lieing around with childish bandages on. No-one can act in this; so far as this  is a masterclass in bad acting. The tanks look like they were knocked up in someone's shed, they do have some authentic weapons though, but that is a small crumb of comfort in what otherwise is the worst use of screen time since the last time I watched a wedding video.There is  no blood when men get shot or bullet holes and everyone dies the way kids do when they are playing at war. The dialogue is so bad that the `actors' should be applauded just for keeping a straight face whilst delivering it. They also all have rubbish accents, ranging from amnesic actor stumble to east coast American and I am talking about the Germans here. The sound is poor in places meaning you can barely hear the cringe worthy guff they are coming out with, which to be honest is probably a blessing. The camera work is shaky cam and sped up and just plain bad. It lacks any sign of decent direction, or production and could have done with some massive editing. The love interest in Klaudia is stunningly awful, she has what appear to be Botox lips and seems to have eaten a whole lipstick in a school girl attempt to look sexy, but instead ends up as a second rate Miss Piggy look a like.The music tries to inject some `mood' but just underscores how bad the on screen `action' actually is. The guns do not recoil and the muzzle flashes have been put on after. There is one shot where the Swastika is round the wrong way which is a sign of peace. On D Day the Americans land in two boats and I have seen better action and convincing acting in a low rent porno. The star is Tino Struckman who also directed this steaming chunder. He lists himself as being a self protection expert on his IMDB page and perhaps he should stick to what he knows best, because if he comes across anyone who has paid out to see this abomination, he may need to employ some pretty nifty 'self defence' of his person.
