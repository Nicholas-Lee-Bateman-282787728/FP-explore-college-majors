1157653,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B0017O1F34,blackaciddevil,"[8, 9]","We find out in Season 4 that there are alot of alien races out there that are fighting one another for control of the galaxy. As we all know, there is one 10 year old kid that ain't going to let that happen and that is Ben Tennyson. Season Four opens up with Ben living out a perfect day, perhaps too perfect-I'm afraid- as he soon discovers and things escalate from there. While most of the episodes walk a familiar ground, the plot thickens more as you soon discover before the Season is over. Team Tennyson may be no more. As for extras, we are given three alternate versions of the Ben 10 Secret of the Omnitrix movie. While each version has minor changes(different heroes used to combat the enemy, a pop up trivia version for fans, etc), they are still worth watching. I'm glad Cartoon Network included this movie with Season Four(it makes one less thing I have to buy in order to have the complete Ben 10 Collection).  Other than that, nothing much to speak of.While I'm older than the audience this series was created for, I can honestly say that it appeals to me too. See, Ben is living every kid's dream of being a hero and I think that is what appeals to fans of the show, including me. I mean, who wouldn't want to be a real hero?? Besides, the cartoon is fun with lots of twists and turns in the storyline. With all the aliens that Ben turns into and the things that he faces, that makes for alot of episode possibilites.If you're into Ben 10 Alien Force, you owe it to yourself to pick up the series that started it all: Ben 10. I'll admit, I wasn't much of a fan til I saw the new show. The series is definitely worth picking up.Now, it is time for me to pick up Volume One of Ben 10 Alien Force.",5,Ben 10- Season Four...The Series Finale....,1231200000,"01 6, 2009",2009,1710,"['find', 'out', 'Season', '4', 'are', 'alot', 'alien', 'races', 'out', 'there', 'are', 'fighting', 'one', 'control', 'galaxy', 'know', 'one', '10', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'ai', ""n't"", 'going', 'let', 'happen', 'Ben', 'Tennyson', 'Season', 'Four', 'up', 'Ben', 'living', 'out', 'perfect', 'day', 'perhaps', 'too', 'perfect-I', ""'m"", 'afraid-', 'soon', 'discovers', 'things', 'escalate', 'there', 'most', 'episodes', 'walk', 'familiar', 'ground', 'plot', 'more', 'soon', 'discover', 'Season', 'over', 'Team', 'Tennyson', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'extras', 'are', 'given', 'three', 'alternate', 'versions', 'Ben', '10', 'Secret', 'Omnitrix', 'movie', 'version', 'minor', 'changes', 'different', 'heroes', 'used', 'combat', 'enemy', 'pop', 'up', 'trivia', 'version', 'fans', 'etc', 'are', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'included', 'movie', 'Season', 'Four', 'one', 'less', 'thing', 'have', 'buy', 'order', 'have', 'complete', 'Ben', '10', 'Collection', 'Other', 'nothing', 'much', 'speak', ""'m"", 'older', 'audience', 'series', 'was', 'created', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'appeals', 'too', 'See', 'Ben', 'living', 'kid', 'dream', 'being', 'hero', 'think', 'what', 'appeals', 'fans', 'show', 'including', 'mean', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'real', 'hero', 'cartoon', 'fun', 'lots', 'twists', 'turns', 'storyline', 'aliens', 'Ben', 'things', 'alot', 'episode', 'possibilites.If', ""'re"", 'Ben', '10', 'Alien', 'Force', 'owe', 'pick', 'up', 'series', 'started', 'Ben', '10', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'fan', 'til', 'saw', 'new', 'show', 'series', 'definitely', 'worth', 'picking', 'up.Now', 'time', 'pick', 'up', 'Volume', 'One', 'Ben', '10', 'Alien', 'Force']",Ben 10 - Season 4

(Of course, the movie ""Race Against Time"" takes place in between, but that's besides the point.)Season four has ten terrific episodes PLUS the original movie ""Secret of the Omnitrix"" with three different openings plus the bonus trivia version as well as some deleted scenes !  These episodes in this set include:""Divided We Stand"" - Once again, the dastardly Dr. Animo returns to get revenge on Ben.  Ben must stop him again with a new alien hero: Ditto !""Don't Drink the Water"" - Ben and Grandpa Max accidentally drink water from the legendary Fountain of Youth.  Now Gwen has to deal with a young  Max and an infantile Ben.""Ken 10"" - Fast-forward into the distant future where the adult Ben 10,000 gives his son Kenny his very own Omnitrix.  But like his father, Kenny has much to learn on how it's used.""Ben 10 vs. The Negative 10"" - An epic two-parter where Ben faces ten of his most villainous of villains.  It's gonna take more than the Omnitrix to save him now.So that about wraps up the series of young Ben and his planetary heroics, but don't get cocky just yet.
