The other two parts are The AFI Tribute to Mel Brooks and The Original Cast Recording Of The Producers. Each of these three are different in form and each has unique content from the others; there is much to be enjoyed and learned in each.Mel Brooks: Make A Noise is a documentary in interview and clip presentation form. First rate.The AFI Tribute is in a roast-testimonial form. Lots of fun.The Original Cast Recording is a vastly entertaining evening with Brooks as he energetically tells us the story of The Producers, from a sound studio's corridors and from the recording booth, in between the Broadway cast singing each of the show's songs; a true behind the scenes documentary recording of a &#34; happening &#34; that is the original cast album.",5,Best Brooks tribute,1377561600,"08 27, 2013",2013,818,"['good', 'presentation', 'History', 'Brooks', 'Part', 'One', 'other', 'two', 'parts', 'are', 'AFI', 'Tribute', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'Original', 'Cast', 'Recording', 'Producers', 'three', 'are', 'different', 'form', 'unique', 'content', 'others', 'much', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'learned', 'each.Mel', 'Brooks', 'Make', 'Noise', 'documentary', 'interview', 'clip', 'presentation', 'form', 'First', 'AFI', 'Tribute', 'roast-testimonial', 'form', 'Lots', 'fun.The', 'Original', 'Cast', 'Recording', 'vastly', 'entertaining', 'evening', 'Brooks', 'energetically', 'story', 'Producers', 'sound', 'studio', 'corridors', 'recording', 'booth', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'singing', 'show', 'songs', 'true', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'recording', '34', 'happening', '34', 'original', 'cast', 'album']",Mel Brooks: Make A Noise

It cannot be denied that he is an all-time great.  One of just a few people who have won  an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony award.  This personal look at Brooks is a wonderful trip down memory lane to take a look at all his classic films and a great insight to all the people who have helped make him a legend.

1625545,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BCMSZWK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[14, 15]","Part of the American Masters series, ""Mel Brooks: Make A Noise"" is certainly a star studded event.  The legendary Brooks is a worthy subject for examination and, as a fan, this was a production I was really looking forward to.  His influence in the world of popular entertainment is absolutely undeniable.  Starting as a television writer in 1949, Brooks has never stopped working in the business he loves.  He's won an Oscar, three Grammys, several Emmys and multiple Tonys for a body of work (as writer, director, comedian, and actor) that is far more immense than most people realize.  He has achieved the exalted EGOT and was only the eighth person in history to achieve that honor when he picked up Tonys for Broadway's ""The Producers"" in 2001.  Let's just say that with a career that spans eight decades, the man has a lot of stories to tell.  And in this presentation, he sits down with his friends to share just a few of them.  If I have any complaints about ""Mel Brooks: Make A Noise,"" it is that there is simply too much to cover in this brief ninety minute program.Most of this special consists of interviews with Mel Brooks, as you might expect.  Brooks is as spry and amusing as always and spars fitfully with the various stars that sit across from him.  Here is a line-up of some of those that come to personally pay homage to Brooks by participating in the interview process: Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner, Richard Lewis, Tracey Ullman, Neil Simon, Joan Rivers, David Steinberg, Barry Levinson, Steven Weber, Cloris Leachman, David Lynch, Bill Pullman, Susan Stroman and Matthew Broderick.  This is a lively bunch to be sure, so the film never wavers in its entertainment factor.  The interviews range from serious to silly, from childhood remembrances to his Broadway triumphs.  There are also plenty of clips from Brooks' movies and TV shows, as well as filmed interviews with old pals Gene Wilder and Madeline Kahn.Sometimes in the American Masters series, the focus is relentlessly upbeat.  The program has a tendency to shy away from unpleasant topics as it deifies its subjects.  Therefore, I did appreciate that Brooks was willing to delve into some of the least successful aspects of his career as well.  While open about many of his successes and failures, he is notably more reticent to discuss topics that are not related to his career.  His wife Anne Bancroft, for example, is certainly an area I'd have liked more insight into.  But trust me, I'll take whatever Brooks gives me.  As an overview of the great man, this is essential viewing AND very entertaining.  It is not, however, particularly comprehensive due to its running time.  What it gives you is great, but I'm greedy and want more, more, more.
