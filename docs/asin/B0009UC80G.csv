""Emergency!"" a show I grew up with and created and directed by Jack Webb (of Dragnet), starring Randolph Mantooth (gotta love that name) and Kevin Tighe (the heavy in Matewan).  The pilot episode is a well done two hour TV movie based on the true story of how paramedics became legal in California.  It mentions the governor, Ronald Reagan who signed the law (no comment on his politics).  You can see a short clip here of Bobby Troup the show's second doctor, singing and playing piano (the actor was the author of the song ""Route 66"").There is a big error in the opening credits that is always annoying to the viewer; namely they put each actor's name on the screen as they show each face....completely covering the faces.  Nelson Riddle (""Batman"" theme song) does the catchy music here.These season one episodes are well done, showing the relays between Rampart and Squad 51.  One is called ""The Mascot"" where John looks after a car crash victim's dog.  Also includes ""Brushfire"", ""Botulism"", ""Nurses Wild"", 12 episodes in all.  Also of mention is Robert Fuller who does a convincing role of doctor Brackett.

The talent of the creators and actors of the show cannot be overstated. It broke new ground for the paramedic program that in real life would be promoted to new heights.The first season has some great episodes, especially the pilot episode (which was actually a television movie). Another reviewer pointed out they cannot show the pilot movie on tv nowadays for whatever reason, but I do remember them showing the pilot once in a while back in the 1970's. It is an easy episode to remember because it's the one where Johnny started out with Fire Station 10. There is really not a bad episode for all of season one.I highly recommend this dvd set along with season two. I haven't bought the dvd set for season three yet, but another reviewer pointed out that either the intro music and/or the end theme has been altered for season three. I find that very interesting because I own several season three episodes released by Columbia House RE-TV, VHS version, and those contain the UNALTERED ORIGINAL season three music themes and credits. Meanwhile, I do own the dvd set for season four. Great episodes, but beware: season four has some major dvd sound transfer/remastering problems.

913018,A1P4862SQIADW1,B0009UC80G,Carl Krampitz,"[5, 6]","First off, I want to say I agree with reviewer Steve Allen.  This set is a long time in coming.  I had the complete set of Emergency! tapes from Columbia House, which ultimately was not even half the episodes from the show.  At best, it was a ""greatest hits"" type of deal.  With that said, I am glad that this great show is finally in a chronological, season-by-season format and on DVD.Now the problems: I was not impressed with the two-sided discs with only three episodes per side.  That was a cheap way out, if you ask me.  I was also expecting special features, like a ""making of"" commentary, or outtakes or SOMETHING!  I was quite disappointed with the format of the set and the overall cheapness of it.  It was definitely worth, maybe, $15 for 11 episodes.  It was a mid-season replacement, after all.As for the show, it was quite refreshing to see these episodes, a lot of which I haven't seen in re-runs.  There were a lot of lesser-known episodes that were just as good or better than the more well known episodes on Columbia House.  This is the show that inspired me to get into EMS as soon as I was old enough in the late '80s.  Surprisingly, a lot of the techniques from the early '70s and that were depicted on the show were still in use at that time.  I grew up with this show and I am real happy to see it out as I stated above.  I am looking forward to season 2, but I just hope that Universal does a little more with that season than they did with season 1.",4,Ah...the memories.

913020,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B0009UC80G,Chrijeff,"[1, 1]","In early-1970's California (a state notorious for its trend-setting), a State Assemblyman (Jack Kruschen) is attempting to guarantee the passage of a bill that will authorize trained fire-rescue personnel to administer medical treatment at the scene of accidents and disasters.  Redheaded fireman (and husband/father) Roy DeSoto (Kevin Tighe) has taken the requisite training and is now boosting the program, while younger bachelor Johnny Gage (Randolph Mantooth) is being encouraged by his chief to sign up but isn't quite sure he really wants to be anything but ""a rescue man.""  Dr. Kelly Brackett (Robert Fuller), the brilliant but sometimes abrasive head of the Emergency Department at LA's Rampart Hospital, is dubious about the idea of non-medical personnel doing doctorish things--not out of any concern for his job, but because he fears the injured may be put in more danger than they already are; head nurse Dixie McCall (Julie London) is all for the idea; and easygoing neurosurgeon Joe Early (Bobby Troup, who was married to London in real life) is willing to just go with the flow.  The double-length pilot episode of this Jack Webb series follows their developing attitudes and the fate of the bill, and the remaining episodes show the firemen and hospital personnel in action.  Like all Webb series, this one is episodic: each segment features several rescues, at least one of which is usually major (the rescue is difficult or dangerous, the doctors are baffled, or the patient is in imminent peril) while another has humorous aspects, and attention is paid to the off-duty life of the principal characters as well.  Baby boomers will enjoy this look back at the roots of a now-ubiquitous institution (""the paramedics""), and their kids may be intrigued by a glimpse into life in a day when cell phones and VCR's didn't yet exist, nurses still wore white uniforms and funny caps, most professions were still dominated by men, and fashions included Afro haircuts and wild prints.  Various well-known names such as Royal Dano, Jeanette Nolan, and others turn up as patients.  This was a favorite series of mine throughout its six-year run and I was delighted at the chance to acquire it on disc.  And despite the material aspects of its look, one thing hasn't changed: the reality of disaster and the necessity for trained people to meet it.",4,Doctors with sirens,1305504000,"05 16, 2011",2011,2353,"['early-1970', 'California', 'state', 'notorious', 'trend-setting', 'State', 'Assemblyman', 'Jack', 'Kruschen', 'attempting', 'guarantee', 'passage', 'bill', 'will', 'authorize', 'trained', 'fire-rescue', 'personnel', 'administer', 'medical', 'treatment', 'scene', 'accidents', 'disasters', 'Redheaded', 'fireman', 'husband/father', 'Roy', 'DeSoto', 'Kevin', 'Tighe', 'taken', 'requisite', 'training', 'now', 'boosting', 'program', 'younger', 'bachelor', 'Johnny', 'Gage', 'Randolph', 'Mantooth', 'being', 'encouraged', 'chief', 'sign', 'up', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'really', 'be', 'anything', 'rescue', 'man', 'Dr.', 'Kelly', 'Brackett', 'Robert', 'Fuller', 'brilliant', 'sometimes', 'abrasive', 'head', 'Emergency', 'Department', 'LA', 'Rampart', 'Hospital', 'dubious', 'idea', 'non-medical', 'personnel', 'doing', 'doctorish', 'things', 'not', 'concern', 'job', 'injured', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'more', 'danger', 'already', 'are', 'head', 'nurse', 'Dixie', 'McCall', 'Julie', 'London', 'idea', 'easygoing', 'neurosurgeon', 'Joe', 'Early', 'Bobby', 'Troup', 'who', 'was', 'married', 'London', 'real', 'life', 'willing', 'just', 'go', 'flow', 'double-length', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'series', 'developing', 'attitudes', 'fate', 'bill', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'show', 'firemen', 'hospital', 'personnel', 'action', 'Webb', 'series', 'one', 'episodic', 'segment', 'several', 'rescues', 'least', 'one', 'usually', 'major', 'rescue', 'difficult', 'dangerous', 'doctors', 'are', 'baffled', 'patient', 'imminent', 'peril', 'humorous', 'aspects', 'attention', 'paid', 'off-duty', 'life', 'principal', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'Baby', 'boomers', 'will', 'enjoy', 'look', 'back', 'roots', 'now-ubiquitous', 'institution', 'paramedics', 'kids', 'may', 'be', 'intrigued', 'glimpse', 'life', 'day', 'when', 'cell', 'phones', 'VCR', 'did', ""n't"", 'yet', 'exist', 'nurses', 'still', 'wore', 'white', 'uniforms', 'funny', 'caps', 'most', 'professions', 'were', 'still', 'dominated', 'men', 'fashions', 'included', 'Afro', 'haircuts', 'wild', 'prints', 'Various', 'well-known', 'names', 'such', 'Royal', 'Dano', 'Jeanette', 'Nolan', 'others', 'turn', 'up', 'patients', 'was', 'favorite', 'series', 'mine', 'six-year', 'run', 'was', 'delighted', 'chance', 'acquire', 'disc', 'material', 'aspects', 'look', 'one', 'thing', ""n't"", 'changed', 'reality', 'disaster', 'necessity', 'trained', 'people', 'meet']",Emergency!

I (along with many other female fans) drooled incessantly over Randolph Mantooth as Johnny Gage and enjoyed the easy banter between he and Roy DeSoto (played by Kevin Tighe).  This show not only showcased medicine and the paramedic field in an almost documentary matter, it also wonderfully epitomized what ensemble acting is all about.  Sure, Randy and Kevin were oftentimes the main focus, but there was no mistaking the contributions of Bobby Troup, Julie London, Robert Fuller and the rest of the Squad 51 actors.  In fact, I only gave this DVD four stars because I know that the wonderful Michael Norell doesn't appear as ""Cap"" until the third season.  I also learned that this DVD only has eleven episodes.

913034,A60PQSFWSQK8K,B0009UC80G,Erik Rupp,"[78, 79]","Emergency was a revolutionary TV show.  It portrayed the work of firefighters, paramedics, and doctors pretty much the way it happens in real life.  Prior to Emergency medical based shows tended to lean towards soap opera style dramatics to create compelling stories.  With Emergency the writers used the real jargon spoken by these professionals (""51 start an IV, D5W TKO,"" ""We're transmitting EKG,"" ""We're sending you a strip, vitals to follow. Pulse is 160, the victim is in extreme pain, Rampart. V-fib!""), and it showed how lives were really saved.The danger of firefighters' work was really shown for the first time in Emergency, and while the show did tend to glamorize firefighters to a small degree it also showed the dedication that they have to their jobs.  Decades before the movie Backdraft you saw firefighters risking their lives on nearly a daily basis.  Realism was goal one for the producers, and they achieved that goal.Season 1 has some great episodes, but it also lacks the cast chemistry that came a year or two later with the addition of Michael Norell as Captain Stanley.  The cast - filled with great personalities like Randolph Mantooth, Kevin Tighe, Robert Fuller, Bobby Troup, Ron Pinkard, and Julie London - spent the first season finding their footing with their characters.  By season 2 most of them had their characters pegged and developed great interplay with each other.The other firefighters on the show, played by Tim Donnelly, Marco Lopez, and Mike Stoker also deserve mention because although some of them were given very little to stretch them as actors they did have the perfect personalities to play those characters.Jack Webb co-created Emergency, and it was his desire to make the show in as close to a ""documentary"" style as possible.  The realism of Emergency ultimately paved the way for later medical shows such as ER.This is definitely a show that should have its entire run on DVD.  Hopefully this first season sells well enought to see the rest of the show released on DVD.

Beaulieu,"[3, 4]","Universal Home Entertainment continues to frustrate fans of their classic TV library by issuing releases on shoddy, poorly-made media that are rife with defects. I consider myself lucky as my Disc #1 experienced only some minor skipping and pixellation on episode #2 on either side, not enough to justify a return in favor of a new set that could be even worse. But this is truly inexcusable. Big retailers such as Amazon and others need to send Universal a loud and clear message that sending junk into the marketplace is unacceptable and force them to clean up their act.As for the series itself -- this was one of my favorite Saturday night shows when I was a kid. It's hard to believe that these episodes are 34 years old now. In some ways I see this series as an attempt by Jack Webb's Mark VII productions to take the Adam-12 formula into the firefighting business. It relies on many of the same plot structures and character types as that series. But I like this better, maybe because of the hour-long format or because of the additional regular characters.Randy Mantooth as John Gage and Kevin Tighe as Roy DeSoto performed dutifully in the series. But looking at it now, the hospital characters, particlarly Robert Fuller's Dr. Kelly Brackett and Julie London's Nurse Dixie McCall seem painfully cliched and wooden. But though she wasn't a great actress, Julie London exudes a subtle sultriness in her scenes that makes watching her worthwhile. I could never warm up to Fuller's character though, preferring Bobby Troup's more human Dr. Joe Early -- even though the thought of musician and songwriter Bobby Troup as a neurosurgeon is a real stretch.Overall, though, I still enjoy watching these episodes. The series captured the early days of the paramedic profession and Jack Webb deserves credit for making the public aware of what was going on in that regard in California at that time, a trend that eventually swept the continent. In that sense, this show performed a real public service. Now if only Universal would live up to their end of the bargain and release it and other series on discs that people can actually use. For the price they are asking, the buying public deserves better.",4,"Classic TV, Classic Bad Discs",1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,2202,"['Universal', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'frustrate', 'fans', 'classic', 'TV', 'library', 'issuing', 'releases', 'shoddy', 'poorly-made', 'media', 'are', 'rife', 'defects', 'consider', 'lucky', 'Disc', '1', 'experienced', 'only', 'minor', 'skipping', 'pixellation', 'episode', '2', 'side', 'not', 'enough', 'justify', 'return', 'favor', 'new', 'set', 'could', 'be', 'even', 'worse', 'truly', 'inexcusable', 'Big', 'retailers', 'such', 'Amazon', 'others', 'need', 'send', 'Universal', 'loud', 'clear', 'message', 'sending', 'junk', 'marketplace', 'unacceptable', 'force', 'clean', 'up', 'act.As', 'series', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'Saturday', 'night', 'shows', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'hard', 'believe', 'episodes', 'are', '34', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'ways', 'see', 'series', 'attempt', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'Mark', 'VII', 'productions', 'take', 'Adam-12', 'formula', 'firefighting', 'business', 'many', 'same', 'plot', 'structures', 'character', 'types', 'series', 'like', 'better', 'maybe', 'hour-long', 'format', 'additional', 'regular', 'characters.Randy', 'Mantooth', 'John', 'Gage', 'Kevin', 'Tighe', 'Roy', 'DeSoto', 'performed', 'dutifully', 'series', 'looking', 'now', 'hospital', 'characters', 'particlarly', 'Robert', 'Fuller', 'Dr.', 'Kelly', 'Brackett', 'Julie', 'London', 'Nurse', 'Dixie', 'McCall', 'seem', 'painfully', 'cliched', 'wooden', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'actress', 'Julie', 'London', 'subtle', 'sultriness', 'scenes', 'watching', 'worthwhile', 'could', 'never', 'warm', 'up', 'Fuller', 'character', 'preferring', 'Bobby', 'Troup', 'more', 'human', 'Dr.', 'Joe', 'Early', 'even', 'thought', 'musician', 'songwriter', 'Bobby', 'Troup', 'neurosurgeon', 'real', 'stretch.Overall', 'still', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'episodes', 'series', 'captured', 'early', 'days', 'paramedic', 'profession', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'credit', 'making', 'public', 'aware', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'regard', 'California', 'time', 'trend', 'eventually', 'swept', 'continent', 'sense', 'show', 'performed', 'real', 'public', 'service', 'Now', 'only', 'Universal', 'would', 'live', 'up', 'end', 'bargain', 'release', 'other', 'series', 'discs', 'people', 'can', 'actually', 'use', 'price', 'are', 'asking', 'buying', 'public', 'deserves', 'better']",Emergency!

Season 2 is now available, and there are some noticible differences between the two.Emergency Season 1 is a bit slow in the beginning and the shows are not as exciting as you may remember them as a kid.  In the early episodes, there is not really a consistant format at all.  It is as if you are watching a work in progress.  In this early version of Emergency, they were obviously experimenting with the storylines, characters, and general direction of the show.When I first got this set, I popped in disc one and sat back expecting a pleasant trip down memory lane.  I must admit, I was a bit dissapointed.  The first episode is a movie that explains how the entire paramedic profession was born.  It is a really good story, but again, not the Emergency you will remember.What you may not remember is that Gage and DeSoto did not know each other before the show began.  What we see is the development of a professional relationship, as well as a personal friendship.  The dynamic-duo of the search and rescue aspect of the show just isn't there.Remember Dr. Brackett?  He could do no wrong. If he lost a patient, there was no hope to begin with.  He was as much of a hero as Guage and DeSoto. In the early episodes, he is often a complete jerk. (He was against the paramedic program altogether!)How about the beautiful Dixie McCall?  We all know she and Dr. Brackett had a relationship, but as a kid, I remember it being mostly innuendo.  In season one, it is a down-right HOT affair!  The interaction between the two is quite entertaining!  No innuendo here.If you are wondering about the lovable Dr. Early, his character is established perfectly from the beginning.  He is exactly how you may remember him.  Gentle, kind and an overall good guy.Season One may not be what you remember, but by the time you are done watching it you will be hooked all over again!",4,A GREAT Work...In Progress,1143158400,"03 24, 2006",2006,1943,"['great', 'set', 'must-have', 'anyone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Emergency', 'Season', '2', 'now', 'available', 'are', 'noticible', 'differences', 'two.Emergency', 'Season', '1', 'bit', 'slow', 'beginning', 'shows', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'exciting', 'may', 'remember', 'kid', 'early', 'episodes', 'not', 'really', 'consistant', 'format', 'are', 'watching', 'work', 'progress', 'early', 'version', 'Emergency', 'were', 'obviously', 'experimenting', 'storylines', 'characters', 'general', 'direction', 'show.When', 'first', 'got', 'set', 'popped', 'disc', 'one', 'sat', 'back', 'expecting', 'pleasant', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'bit', 'dissapointed', 'first', 'episode', 'movie', 'how', 'entire', 'paramedic', 'profession', 'was', 'born', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'again', 'not', 'Emergency', 'will', 'remember.What', 'may', 'not', 'remember', 'Gage', 'DeSoto', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'other', 'show', 'began', 'What', 'see', 'development', 'professional', 'relationship', 'as', 'well', 'personal', 'friendship', 'dynamic-duo', 'search', 'rescue', 'aspect', 'show', 'just', ""n't"", 'there.Remember', 'Dr.', 'Brackett', 'could', 'do', 'wrong', 'lost', 'patient', 'was', 'hope', 'begin', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'hero', 'Guage', 'DeSoto', 'early', 'episodes', 'often', 'complete', 'jerk', 'was', 'paramedic', 'program', 'altogether', 'How', 'beautiful', 'Dixie', 'McCall', 'know', 'Dr.', 'Brackett', 'had', 'relationship', 'kid', 'remember', 'being', 'mostly', 'innuendo', 'season', 'one', 'down-right', 'HOT', 'affair', 'interaction', 'two', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'innuendo', 'here.If', 'are', 'wondering', 'lovable', 'Dr', 'Early', 'character', 'established', 'perfectly', 'beginning', 'exactly', 'how', 'may', 'remember', 'Gentle', 'kind', 'overall', 'good', 'guy.Season', 'One', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'remember', 'time', 'are', 'done', 'watching', 'will', 'be', 'hooked', 'over', 'again']",Emergency!

I particularly love the beginning intro theme, and it is good to see that this was not deleted.The only trouble I have had so far, is with the audio and visual being out of sync (it's a bit like watching a foreign dubbed film!!!!).  I have tried to fix this on my DVD player and think I may have been successful, so next time I watch an episode, I expect it to be ok (fingers crossed!!!).  I haven't experienced this with other DVD's so hope it isn't a problem with this DVD set.The sound and visual quality of the DVDs I found to be good.I would have preferred the DVD's to be single sided rather than double-sided.  It is a bit of a hit and miss approach to determine which side of the DVD to play if you are looking for a particular episode.  Information is only given on one side (I assume side A), and I assume if you want to play side A, you have the writing side up (and side A is thus the underside).  Complicated, I know!!!!  The beauty of single-sided DVD's is you don't have this problem.All in all, I would definitely recommend this DVD set.  Emergency!  hasn't been (and probably won't be) on Pay TV (here in Australia) and so if you want to relive this show, buying the DVD's is probably the only way you can see it.  I will definitely be buying Season 2 etc when it is released.I am giving this DVD set a 4 1/2 star rating - had it been on single sided DVD's I would have given it a 5 star rating.",4,One of my favourite TV Shows!!!,1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,1539,"['have', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'episodes', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'yet', 'am', 'not', 'disappointed', 'purchase', 'particularly', 'love', 'beginning', 'intro', 'theme', 'good', 'see', 'was', 'not', 'deleted.The', 'only', 'trouble', 'have', 'had', 'so', 'far', 'audio', 'visual', 'being', 'sync', 'bit', 'watching', 'foreign', 'dubbed', 'film', 'have', 'tried', 'fix', 'DVD', 'player', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'successful', 'next', 'time', 'watch', 'episode', 'expect', 'be', 'ok', 'fingers', 'crossed', 'have', ""n't"", 'experienced', 'other', 'DVD', 'so', 'hope', ""n't"", 'problem', 'DVD', 'set.The', 'sound', 'visual', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'found', 'be', 'good.I', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'DVD', 'be', 'single', 'sided', 'rather', 'double-sided', 'bit', 'hit', 'miss', 'approach', 'determine', 'side', 'DVD', 'play', 'are', 'looking', 'particular', 'episode', 'Information', 'only', 'given', 'one', 'side', 'assume', 'side', 'A', 'assume', 'want', 'play', 'side', 'A', 'have', 'writing', 'side', 'side', 'A', 'thus', 'underside', 'Complicated', 'know', 'beauty', 'single-sided', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem.All', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'Emergency', ""n't"", 'been', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'Pay', 'TV', 'here', 'Australia', 'so', 'want', 'relive', 'show', 'buying', 'DVD', 'probably', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'see', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'buying', 'Season', '2', 'etc', 'when', 'released.I', 'am', 'giving', 'DVD', 'set', '4', '1/2', 'star', 'rating', 'had', 'been', 'single', 'sided', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5', 'star', 'rating']",Emergency!

""junkie"".The show was truly revolutionary for it's time. I've recently learned that the L.A. County Fire Department, upon being asked to assist in the making of Emergency, insisted that every rescue and fire scene be based on real-life L.A.County Fire Department responses, and that each scene and film shot be made as realistic as possible.This makes Emergency! even more enjoyable to watch, knowing how ""true to life"" it was.Shows like ""Rescue Me"", where every charecter (I know I misspelled it) seems like a self-centered jerk, can't compare to Emergency. John & Roy, Captain Stanley, Drs. Brackett & Early, Dixie and the ""Engine 51"" gang were all terrific, and were people of good moral & ethical charecter (why don't I know how to spell this word!).Whether you watched the show when it was on NBC, on TV Land, Columbia House VHS, or are watching it on DVD as a first-time viewer, this is a great show...for anyone from age 2 to 102.If you have children, this is a show you can watch with them, without worrying about graphic material or word content.

Despite the outdated medical equipment and protocol (the paramedics have to call their local hospital for treatment authorizations) this Jack-Webb directed series overall stands the test of time.A show about the daily adventures of paramedics is not very revolutionary today, but in the early 1970's it was groundbreaking. In that earlier era, most people had grown up knowing that an ambulance could not patch people up en route to Rampart Hospital---something which my generation takes as a given today.The people in this series are (of course) Hollywood actors, but the message they deliver is effective. Even with comparatively sanitized scripts (these paramedics apparently specialize in treating bloodless injuries!) and an eerily quiet hospital where Dr. Kelly Brackett (Robert Fuller) and Nurse Dixie McCall (Julie London) work, the scripts are amazing for what they were.This TV drama even earned praise from then-Senator Alan Cranston (D-CA) for informing the public about the numerous benefits of the paramedic program. Receiving commendations from a Federal Legislator is a pretty impressive track sheet for a fictional television show. Today's so-called reality shows can only dream of having such cultural impact upon the American psyche.11 episodes are included in the 1972-1973 season. Extras on this disc are the Wedsworth-Townsend Act (actually the first 'episode) which explains how the paramedic program is authorized--and the subsequent episodes themselves can exist.The short season is compensated by realistic script writing acknowlleging that these paramedics are immediately and then constantly at work once they come into existence, this is not a job for the slacker. Plus, it certainly does not hurt that the two male leads themselves are very hunky--I'm genuinely torn between Kevin Tighe and Randolph Mantooh!Because they do get easily scratched (including with careful handing!)

Joe Friday) on DRAGNET, that delivered a double dose of medical drama and real-life action into its stories, which made it a major favorite among viewers during its 1972-77 run on NBC.This 1972-73 Season set compiles the first 11 episodes of the program, in which LA County paramedics Johnny Gage (Randolph Mantooth) and Roy De Soto (Kevin Tighe) tackle crises both big and small, from plane accidents (""Crash,"" ""Dealer's Wild"") and baby deliveries (""Brushfire"") to the rescue of a horse in a ditch (""Publicity Hound"").Ably assisting the men in the field are the emergency room hospital staff, led by Dr. Joe Early (Bobby Troup, the composer of ""Route 66""), Dr. Kelly Brackett (Robert Fuller of Laramie), and Nurse Dixie McCall (singer Julie London); Deirdre Hall famous from DAYS OF OUR LIVES also appeared (in this season only) as Nurse Sally Lewis.An energetic and entertaining series, the success of EMERGENCY not only spawned a host of promotional tie-ins (and a Saturday morning cartoon), but also helped spark attention for and interest in paramedic work during its network run, which is a considerable legacy for any television program.Though no extras are included in EMERGENCY's 1st Season double-disc set, the 1972 two-part pilot, ""The Wedsworth-Townsend Affair,"" is included; directed by Jack Webb, the pilot also features guest appearances by Martin Milner and Kent McCord in their roles from another of his then-current series, ADAM-12.This primetime reality"" show based on true-to-life events shows how paramedics and medical personnel save lives with split-second decisions and actions.

It's hard to even imagine a world w/o paramedics, let alone them being contested as amateur doctors, as in the first Emergency disc. I rented this from Netflix, and while I only checked out the first disc (which wasn't doubled sided btw, I think they changed the format!) I think I'll be passing on this as a purchase.I really loved the interaction with ""Gage"" (and Desoto). His character is genuine and the stuff underdog heroes are made of. Sadly, an entire half of the show seems to be dedicated to the rather painful caricatures back at the hospital. I for one really do not like ""doctor shows"" but am willing to bypass my own indifferences for the sake of good acting and good characters (like Quincy), sadly, there isn't much of either there. The doctors and nursing staff seem artificial and border on being cruel.The picture and sound quality are on par with some of the best I've seen and if they have converted these to one sided discs ""enmass"" it will all be for the best.
