In this 60 minute production for beginners and intermediate levels, Kathy Smith has selected some poses that are doable for the novice, by that I mean that she isn't asking you to bend over backward and touch the floor.With instructor, Rod Stryker, Kathy guides you through some basic poses, and most being workable for the beginners.  What gets confusing here is her vocal lead, telling us to move the right leg up while she moves her left one up.  This happens periodically and if you happen to have your face in the floor and not on the screen, you will get confused while striving to perfect the form.The best approach to new yoga is to watch it a couple of times, especially on the more challenging poses because you need to exact your pose in order to do the correct form, which is essential.  You can follow another instructor who does a less challenging form, but you may not always get a view of that person you need to watch.The video is divided into two sections, 30 minutes of standing and 30 minutes of floor and finishing postures.The sets are attractive, music is pleasing to the ear.

I began to feel better almost immediately and see physical improvement in 2 weeks. The pace is good. The instructions are clear. Variations for different levels are demonstrated. This has allowed me to &quot;grow&quot; with the tape by doing more challenging variations with my &quot;strong&quot; muscle groups while still working lower levels on &quot;weaker&quot; areas. I recommend using the &quot;New Yoga for Beginners&quot; first, to get the most from this tape but it is definately a purchase I am glad I've made.",5,gets results fast,995760000,"07 22, 2001",2001,643,"['just', 'began', 'doing', 'yoga', 'favourite', 'tape', 'do', 'just', 'day', 'improve', 'everytime', 'do', 'tape', 'began', 'feel', 'better', 'almost', 'immediately', 'see', 'physical', 'improvement', '2', 'weeks', 'pace', 'good', 'instructions', 'are', 'clear', 'Variations', 'different', 'levels', 'are', 'demonstrated', 'allowed', 'quot', 'grow', 'quot', 'tape', 'doing', 'more', 'challenging', 'variations', 'quot', 'strong', 'quot', 'muscle', 'groups', 'still', 'working', 'lower', 'levels', 'quot', 'weaker', 'quot', 'areas', 'recommend', 'using', 'quot', 'New', 'Yoga', 'Beginners', 'quot', 'first', 'get', 'most', 'tape', 'definately', 'purchase', 'am', 'glad', ""'ve"", 'made']",Kathy Smith - New Yoga VHS
188815,A17TDSX354MP7Y,1573309885,CPTScott,"[24, 25]","I have about 100 yoga programs these days and have been practicing Yoga on a daily basis for almost 10 years. I also have the good fortune to study with a wonderful and gifted teacher so I have quite a bit of experience both with Yoga and Yoga Video/DVD programs.While I was probably the most skeptical person in the world about ""fitness queen"" Kathy Smith doing yoga and thought it was probably a ""Get on the Yoga Bandwagon"" phase for her, I have to admit that I think this and her other Yoga videos are very well done.First I think it's important to clarify something, Rod Stryker is the one who put together this and her other programs and Rod is as knowledgable and reputable a Yoga teacher out there. Kathy has also been doing Yoga for over 20 years and is extremely adept at demonstrating the poses, plus she's a very experienced teacher who is very easy to understand.I also like the fact that this video isn't rushed (it's about 55 minutes long) and so you aren't rushing through the postures, something that you don't always find. Many videos that are shorter are fine (such as the Yoga Zone shorter routines) but I find I have to actually do about 15 minutes of warm ups before doing them, with this video you don't need to do that.Regarding some complaints that it's repetitive, I would highly disagree. Of course you are going to do many repititions of Sun Salutations (that's standard in many forms of Yoga from Sivananda to Ashtanga and many other schools as well). These repetitions are a sound way of warming up your body. The heat that is created in the body prepare you to safely do the poses that are held for longer periods of time. So while there are many ""repetitions"", it's not ""repetitive"" because of a lack of creativity or for the sake of filling up timeIn fact, I like to start the Sun Salutes with modifications and gradually work up to the more ""full expression"" of the various postures with each repetition of the sequence. This way of working really keeps things especially interesting and makes you really internalize your practice (since you need to really feel what your body is ready for during each repetition).I also like that this program uses ""Lunge Salutes""  which are excellent hip openers and leg strengthers as well. What's also nice is that these are different Sun Salutes from Kathy's advanced program which use the Sun Salutes A and B. This makes for nice variety if you have the whole set of tapes/DVD's and allows you to work your body differently.The poses are shown with modifications so you can adapt your practice to your ability and or energy level.I would highly recommend this program (or the whole set) to those folks who want a well rounded and easy to follow yoga practice.Also, while I am very much into the spiritual aspects of Yoga, I understand that many folks are not. These programs definitely focus on the physical aspects of the practice so those who only want that aspect of Yoga will be pleased. Those who want to go into the more internal aspects can do so on their own if they like.Of course there are many wonderful Yoga programs for sale and depending on your personal preferences you may like some more than others, but as someone who has a large collection of programs I think this and Kathy's other Yoga programs are as good as any out there and believe me I was VERY skeptical.In fact I highly recommend this and her other Yoga programs.Another outstanding intermediate Yoga program is Sherri Baptise Freeman's ""Baptiste Power Of Yoga"" (available on amazon).

188819,A18H0VW5SIQFSP,1573309885,The Boobazu,"[0, 0]","This DVD is labeled ""intermediate"", HOWEVER the most challenging pose on the disc is the Eagle. No arm balances, inversions, or anything beyond the most basic back bend/bridge.Other things I do not like about this DVD:-Throughout the practice the camera light filters change so it goes from color to b/w to black and yellow/orange and other shades of colors. This I find distracting, visually unappealing, and pointless. The camera is also repeatedly tilted at odd angles.-Not all the names of the poses are specified.-Switches between Kathy's live voice instruction and a voice over. When the voice over is on it switches between Kathy's and Rod's voices. This is confusing.-In several shots views of Kathy and company are partially obstructed by set pieces.-One of the sun salutations is shown in slow motion for no apparent reason.-In one scene we see only Kathy's head as she explains and demonstrates a pose.-The set is ugly. It is indoors but pretends to be outdoors. It's supposed to look like a beach or something on a clear day, however the set is rather dim and much in shadow with what looks like a spotlight moving around randomly.This being said, it's not a bad DVD for beginners. There is a long introduction which talks about basic yoga safety and how to protect the spine in both forward and back bends. The instruction throughout the DVD is fairly detailed. There are three other people besides Kathy demonstrating modified versions of poses.I do not recommend this DVD for intermediate yogis as you will most likely be bored and disappointed.",2,NOT for intermediate yogis,1333065600,"03 30, 2012",2012,1560,"['DVD', 'labeled', 'intermediate', 'HOWEVER', 'most', 'challenging', 'pose', 'disc', 'Eagle', 'arm', 'balances', 'inversions', 'anything', 'most', 'basic', 'back', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'DVD', 'practice', 'camera', 'light', 'filters', 'change', 'color', 'b/w', 'black', 'yellow/orange', 'other', 'shades', 'colors', 'find', 'distracting', 'visually', 'unappealing', 'pointless', 'camera', 'also', 'repeatedly', 'tilted', 'odd', 'angles.-Not', 'names', 'poses', 'are', 'specified.-Switches', 'Kathy', 'live', 'voice', 'instruction', 'voice', 'When', 'voice', 'over', 'Kathy', 'Rod', 'voices', 'confusing.-In', 'several', 'shots', 'views', 'Kathy', 'company', 'are', 'partially', 'obstructed', 'set', 'pieces.-One', 'sun', 'salutations', 'shown', 'slow', 'motion', 'apparent', 'reason.-In', 'one', 'scene', 'see', 'only', 'Kathy', 'head', 'pose.-The', 'set', 'ugly', 'indoors', 'pretends', 'be', 'outdoors', 'supposed', 'look', 'beach', 'something', 'clear', 'day', 'however', 'set', 'rather', 'dim', 'much', 'shadow', 'what', 'spotlight', 'moving', 'around', 'randomly.This', 'being', 'said', 'not', 'bad', 'DVD', 'beginners', 'long', 'introduction', 'basic', 'yoga', 'safety', 'how', 'protect', 'spine', 'forward', 'back', 'bends', 'instruction', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'detailed', 'are', 'three', 'other', 'people', 'Kathy', 'demonstrating', 'modified', 'versions', 'poses.I', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'intermediate', 'yogis', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'bored', 'disappointed']",Kathy Smith - New Yoga VHS
