183569,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,1563710803,Char,"[3, 3]","A famous family film for young adolescents. After seeing it, I agree that it is very fine. It probably would appeal to children as young as 7-8 and on up, depending upon the taste of the particular child.  Also, some grown-ups would like it.  I'm a grown up, and I liked it a lot!The story is set in the Ozark Mountains, around the time of the Great Depression or perhaps earlier, and revolves around a thematic element having to do with hounds and coon-hunting, a subject you don't hear much about anymore but which some viewers, especially male ones, might relish.  (The movie was first made in 1974, I think.) On the other hand, some contemporary viewers might feel moral objections to hunting as a sport in which animals are killed.  This film doesn't promote wanton killing of animals, and no guns are used, but the story does take place where attitudes to hunting probably included the idea that coons were fair game and coon-hunting was a fair sport because coons were pests that destroyed the farmers' crops.Although this story takes place within an overall acceptance of the existence of God, the film is NOT Evangelical in purpose or tone.  The purpose of the film is just to tell a story about character development in a growing boy of about age 10-12 years old.  This character development takes place under the auspices of two good father-figure mentors, and a caring mother.  The story is narrated (but minimally) by the voice of the boy as an old man looking back nostalgically upon all that happened during this special time in his youth.The title of the film refers to a legend surrounding the supposed existence of a very rare wild plant, the red fern, and the special ""human"" conditions in which it supposedly will grow. (I couldn't understand the details about the red fern because I couldn't understand the voice of the little girl in the movie who told about it.)There is beautiful woodsy scenery in the movie.  The instrumental music throughout is nice, and there are three ballads which are VERY nicely done and which moved me so much that I was ""blown away,"" as the saying goes.  It was when I heard the first ballad that I thought to myself, ""I LOVE this movie!"" --and my feelings about it did not change by the end of it.The characters in the movie are supposed to be rural folk, however, the actors and the sets here come across as looking like more sophisticated contemporary ""actors"" under their character facades.  Although this isn't a Hallmark movie, it has a bit of that quality that you find in Hallmark dramatizations in which there always seems to be a slightly prettified and cleaned-up look permeating all the people and scenes.  Even though I was aware of this aura of idealization about the movie, I thought it was acceptable because it didn't seem to lend dishonesty to the basic intentions of the story.  It was rather appropriate to the nostalgic sentimentality that was involved in the old man's looking back at his childhood.I like the movie a lot because it IS wholesome and is likely to promote good character development and specific,  good-hearted, character-supportive life-values in young people.  And for me personally, I feel sure that I'll always look back fondly on the movie, enjoying the bitter-sweet (because sadness is mingled into this story) memory of it.--AND, I enjoyed and loved those terrific hound dogs!",5,"A terrific story, well told in a lovely movie.",1315699200,"09 11, 2011",2011,3370,"['famous', 'family', 'film', 'young', 'adolescents', 'seeing', 'agree', 'very', 'fine', 'probably', 'would', 'appeal', 'children', 'as', 'young', '7-8', 'depending', 'taste', 'particular', 'child', 'Also', 'grown-ups', 'would', 'like', ""'m"", 'grown', 'up', 'liked', 'lot', 'story', 'set', 'Ozark', 'Mountains', 'time', 'Great', 'Depression', 'perhaps', 'earlier', 'around', 'thematic', 'element', 'having', 'do', 'hounds', 'coon-hunting', 'subject', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'much', 'anymore', 'viewers', 'especially', 'male', 'ones', 'might', 'relish', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'made', '1974', 'think', 'other', 'hand', 'contemporary', 'viewers', 'might', 'feel', 'moral', 'objections', 'hunting', 'sport', 'animals', 'are', 'killed', 'film', ""n't"", 'promote', 'wanton', 'killing', 'animals', 'guns', 'are', 'used', 'story', 'take', 'place', 'where', 'attitudes', 'hunting', 'probably', 'included', 'idea', 'coons', 'were', 'fair', 'game', 'coon-hunting', 'was', 'fair', 'sport', 'coons', 'were', 'pests', 'destroyed', 'farmers', 'crops.Although', 'story', 'place', 'overall', 'acceptance', 'existence', 'God', 'film', 'NOT', 'Evangelical', 'purpose', 'tone', 'purpose', 'film', 'just', 'tell', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'growing', 'boy', 'about', 'age', '10-12', 'years', 'old', 'character', 'development', 'place', 'auspices', 'two', 'good', 'father-figure', 'mentors', 'caring', 'mother', 'story', 'narrated', 'minimally', 'voice', 'boy', 'old', 'man', 'looking', 'back', 'nostalgically', 'happened', 'special', 'time', 'youth.The', 'title', 'film', 'refers', 'legend', 'surrounding', 'supposed', 'existence', 'very', 'rare', 'wild', 'plant', 'red', 'fern', 'special', 'human', 'conditions', 'supposedly', 'will', 'grow', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'details', 'red', 'fern', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'voice', 'little', 'girl', 'movie', 'who', 'told', 'beautiful', 'woodsy', 'scenery', 'movie', 'instrumental', 'music', 'nice', 'are', 'three', 'ballads', 'are', 'VERY', 'nicely', 'done', 'moved', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'saying', 'was', 'when', 'heard', 'first', 'ballad', 'thought', 'myself', 'LOVE', 'movie', 'feelings', 'did', 'not', 'change', 'end', 'it.The', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'rural', 'folk', 'however', 'actors', 'sets', 'here', 'come', 'looking', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'contemporary', 'actors', 'character', 'facades', ""n't"", 'Hallmark', 'movie', 'bit', 'quality', 'find', 'Hallmark', 'dramatizations', 'always', 'be', 'slightly', 'prettified', 'cleaned-up', 'look', 'permeating', 'people', 'scenes', 'Even', 'was', 'aware', 'aura', 'idealization', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'acceptable', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'lend', 'dishonesty', 'basic', 'intentions', 'story', 'was', 'rather', 'appropriate', 'nostalgic', 'sentimentality', 'was', 'involved', 'old', 'man', 'looking', 'back', 'childhood.I', 'movie', 'lot', 'wholesome', 'likely', 'promote', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'specific', 'good-hearted', 'character-supportive', 'life-values', 'young', 'people', 'personally', 'feel', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'always', 'look', 'back', 'fondly', 'movie', 'enjoying', 'bitter-sweet', 'sadness', 'mingled', 'story', 'memory', 'it.', 'enjoyed', 'loved', 'terrific', 'hound', 'dogs']",N/A

He lives in a part of the country where coons abound and its just natural to have coon dogs. The coons can be sold to England for money, so it is a trade for some. For others it is a contest to show how many coons there dogs can catch. Competition and sport becomes important to many who own coon dogs. The young boy is the main character in the story and his relationship to two dogs that he saves money to buy and than train is mostly half of the movie. The next half is a competition between other coon dogs to see who can win prize money and the trophy by how many coons the dogs can catch. The last part of the movie is sad and sort of hokey. I don't particularly like hunting as a sport so maybe that is why I couldn't get into this movie. The story revolves around animals being chased into trees and up roofs, etc. The cinematography is just beautiful and I would have loved to have seen this on the big screen. It sort of reminds me of the landscape in Songcatcher. That movie was based in the Applacians. The acting in the movie is pretty dry and not alot of affect in put into their characterizations. Overall, I rated it three stars. I love animals and this movie is all about the relationship about the boy and his pets but it just doesn't show that bond that I wanted to see. There were some scenes where the dogs looked so cute, especially when they were first learning to hunt coons.

183596,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,1563710803,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Where the Red Fern Grows (Norman Tokar, 1974)I don't keep a Best Books list the way I keep a Best Movies list (yet), but if I did, Wilson Rawls' Where the Red Fern Grows would be somewhere in the top ten. I don't believe there's a single book that requires multiple sittings to read that I have read more often than that one; I probably read it four or five times a year between discovering it in sixth grade (I had Summer of the Monkeys as an assignment in school, and so I decided to find out what else that guy had written) and, oh, 1990 or thereabouts.  And yet somehow I had not only never seen the movie adaptation, but never even knew such a thing existed, until a few nights ago. So, with trepidation, I sat down to watch it. Now, I haven't read the book for quite a while, and I tried to take into account that the book is never as good as the movie, but still, I found myself entirely unable to work up a lot of enthusiasm for it.Plot: Billy (Seven Alone's Stewart Petersen in his screen debut; as of this writing, his film career seems to have ended in 1981) is a boy from so far on the wrong side of the tracks in the Ozarks that tracks don't even exist there yet; his family is hardscrabble-poor, trying to make a go of it farming in the middle of a drought, while his parents (Twice-Told Tales' Beverly Garland and High Plains Drifter's Jack Ging) harbor a dream of buying their uncle's feed store in Tulsa and making a living as real businesspeople. Billy's dreams are not nearly so grand; he just wants a couple of coonhounds so he can go hunting. Raccoon skins, we're told, are all the rage in Vermont, and Billy proposes using the money from them to do things like help his father get a new mule. Grandpa (The Shawshank Redemption's James Whitmore) counsels Billy that the lord helps those who helps themselves, and once Billy groks what he's on about, it's time to start scrimping, saving, and doing odd jobs to raise the money to buy a couple of hounds. From there, well, if you haven't read the book yet, get on that....and with a few exceptions, the movie tallies well with what I remember of the book, a statement I have heard numerous times reading comment threads and discussions about it. There were a few discrepancies that I rush to add may be in my head rather than on the screen. I don't remember the book being nearly as religion-centric, nor do I remember Billy being quite to selfless; it's possible to change emphases in a story and still be faithful to the source material, though, and those make sense given the structure (if you need to be clued in, look at the main title credits; the font used is right out of a fifties Western, and Tokar went for both the structure and the morals that come packaged with same). The climactic scene, on the other hand, was changed, and very deliberately; there may have been a reason for doing so, but I have yet to come up with anyone who's advanced a good reason for doing so. I also understand that one cannot fit an entire novel, faithfully, in a movie, and thus cuts need to be made; I had to question why they spent so much of the film pre-dogs, which ended up rushing the dogs section. (As a side note, that balance could have easily been rectified by cutting out all the religion and &#8220;oh look how selfless I am&#8221; nonsense.) Maybe (again) I'm misremembering, but the competition seemed especially rushed; (quasi-spoiler alert) what I recall as taking up a good quarter of the book got crammed into about ten minutes of screen time, with lots of minor characters and that sort of thing absent, or present only in passing. Mostly what watching the movie did was remind me I need to re-read the book. ** ",3,It Grows for Thee.,1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,3692,"['Where', 'Red', 'Fern', 'Grows', 'Norman', 'Tokar', '1974', 'do', ""n't"", 'keep', 'Best', 'Books', 'list', 'way', 'keep', 'Best', 'Movies', 'list', 'yet', 'did', 'Wilson', 'Rawls', 'Where', 'Red', 'Fern', 'Grows', 'would', 'be', 'somewhere', 'top', 'ten', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'single', 'book', 'multiple', 'sittings', 'read', 'have', 'read', 'more', 'often', 'one', 'probably', 'read', 'four', 'five', 'times', 'year', 'discovering', 'sixth', 'grade', 'had', 'Summer', 'Monkeys', 'assignment', 'school', 'so', 'decided', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'else', 'guy', 'had', 'written', 'oh', '1990', 'thereabouts', 'yet', 'somehow', 'had', 'not', 'only', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'never', 'even', 'knew', 'such', 'thing', 'existed', 'few', 'nights', 'ago', 'So', 'trepidation', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'Now', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'quite', 'while', 'tried', 'take', 'account', 'book', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'still', 'found', 'entirely', 'unable', 'work', 'up', 'lot', 'enthusiasm', 'it.Plot', 'Billy', 'Seven', 'Alone', 'Stewart', 'Petersen', 'screen', 'debut', 'writing', 'film', 'career', 'have', 'ended', '1981', 'boy', 'so', 'far', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'Ozarks', 'tracks', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'exist', 'there', 'yet', 'family', 'hardscrabble-poor', 'trying', 'make', 'go', 'farming', 'middle', 'drought', 'parents', 'Twice-Told', 'Tales', 'Beverly', 'Garland', 'High', 'Plains', 'Drifter', 'Jack', 'Ging', 'harbor', 'dream', 'buying', 'uncle', 'feed', 'store', 'Tulsa', 'making', 'living', 'real', 'businesspeople', 'Billy', 'dreams', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'grand', 'just', 'couple', 'coonhounds', 'can', 'go', 'hunting', 'Raccoon', 'skins', ""'re"", 'told', 'are', 'rage', 'Vermont', 'Billy', 'using', 'money', 'do', 'things', 'like', 'help', 'father', 'get', 'new', 'mule', 'Grandpa', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'counsels', 'Billy', 'lord', 'who', 'helps', 'once', 'Billy', 'what', 'time', 'start', 'scrimping', 'saving', 'doing', 'odd', 'jobs', 'raise', 'money', 'buy', 'couple', 'hounds', 'there', 'well', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'yet', 'get', '.and', 'few', 'exceptions', 'movie', 'tallies', 'well', 'what', 'remember', 'book', 'statement', 'have', 'heard', 'numerous', 'times', 'reading', 'comment', 'threads', 'discussions', 'were', 'few', 'discrepancies', 'rush', 'add', 'may', 'be', 'head', 'rather', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'book', 'being', 'nearly', 'religion-centric', 'do', 'remember', 'Billy', 'being', 'quite', 'selfless', 'possible', 'change', 'emphases', 'story', 'still', 'be', 'faithful', 'source', 'material', 'make', 'sense', 'given', 'structure', 'need', 'be', 'clued', 'look', 'main', 'title', 'credits', 'font', 'used', 'right', 'fifties', 'Western', 'Tokar', 'went', 'structure', 'morals', 'come', 'packaged', 'same', 'climactic', 'scene', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'changed', 'very', 'deliberately', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'reason', 'doing', 'so', 'have', 'yet', 'come', 'up', 'anyone', 'who', 'advanced', 'good', 'reason', 'doing', 'so', 'also', 'understand', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'fit', 'entire', 'novel', 'faithfully', 'movie', 'thus', 'cuts', 'need', 'be', 'made', 'had', 'question', 'why', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'pre-dogs', 'ended', 'up', 'rushing', 'dogs', 'section', 'side', 'note', 'balance', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'rectified', 'cutting', 'out', 'religion', '8220', 'look', 'how', 'selfless', 'am', '8221', 'nonsense', 'Maybe', 'again', ""'m"", 'misremembering', 'competition', 'seemed', 'especially', 'rushed', 'quasi-spoiler', 'alert', 'what', 'recall', 'taking', 'up', 'good', 'quarter', 'book', 'got', 'crammed', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'lots', 'minor', 'characters', 'sort', 'thing', 'absent', 'present', 'only', 'passing', 'Mostly', 'what', 'watching', 'movie', 'did', 'was', 'remind', 'need', 're-read', 'book', '**']",N/A
