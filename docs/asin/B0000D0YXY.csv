776893,A2ZKEBPCKEHDGL,B0000D0YXY,C McGhee,"[1, 2]","A solid 3 star show with lots to smile about. A fun film set in both funny & not so funny circumstances. The theme of a young man helped out of virginity by an older woman is as old as can be but a whole movie about a man scared of women his own age is priceless. Mind you I have no trouble believing it happens in real life but was surprised it ever happened in reel life.I'm sure the stars here had a great deal of fun making this show & it, dare we say it ""comes out"" in their performances. Each individual segment seemed a bit trite to me but the sum of them all was poignant as the credits rolled. There were places the director & writer could have gone wrong & it never happens. I felt they showed what the story required & did not error in what they allowed on screen. This is an adult story & if full nudity bothers you or your distraught by other than missionary coitus you should avoid this.I would have rated this show higher but these characters did not require much depth. It is still a great fun show & shouldn't be judged to critically or prudishly.

776894,A11PTCZ2FM2547,B0000D0YXY,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[13, 13]","Oh, for a Time Machine. . .some metaphysical contraption to take me back to the Seventies, when I first saw and enjoyed this cute little movie.  Back in those heady days, I was able to lustily envy a young dude who embarks on a series of steamy affairs with attractive women almost twice his age, to gawk and gander while the muscular protagonist sweats and grunts and groans--then collapses exhausted into the nurturing arms of his mature lover.But, time marches on, and so does my perception.  Almost thirty years after its theatrical release, I now watch IN PRAISE OF OLDER WOMEN and subsequently fidget and squirm with discomfort.  And that's not because the story is any less intriguing:  on the contrary, it's all the more alluring as I wax nostalgia from the distance of middle age. What bothers me--annoys me, actually--is the lack of production quality for this film:  from shabby lighting, to mumbling audio, to a musical score that literally makes you reach for the &quot;Mute&quot; button.But there are other troubling problems.  Young Andras Vayda (Tom Berenger) is a young Hungarian with a wandering eye for the older ladies.  And Andras does find love (the rascal) in his turbulent, war-torn country--a country desperately trying to break free from Soviet domination.  Yet when Andras participates in the ill-fated Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the event is filmed in a sound stage the size of my living room (so much for scale).  Forced to flee Hungary, Andras takes his appetite to Montreal, and the trysts continue.Some of the &quot;older women&quot; include Karen Black, Susan Strasberg, and Helen Shaver.  The &quot;mature scenes&quot; were certainly provocative in the Seventies, but are bland by today's standards.  Berenger furnishes sufficient &quot;abs of steel&quot; to satisfy female viewers, while the guys catch glimpses of female nudity through all the awful lighting.  As a comedy-drama, IN PRAISE OF OLDER WOMEN is passing entertainment, provided the viewer can look past all of its annoying defects.--D.

776897,A3BWP965RIWBCU,B0000D0YXY,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[0, 0]","""In Praise of Older Women"" had a momentous part to play in helping the Canadian film industry to get firmly on its own two feet. The novel on which it is based itself had been a strong seller and of real influence in the Dominion of Canada and abroad, too. So great so was the book's lasting appeal abroad that this led, in 1997 in Spain, to the appearance, from Lolafilms, of another zesty but less daring film, ""En brazos de la mujer madura"" (Studio Latino DVD-22142-1), which based itself more loosely upon the book, setting the action in Spain during, and just after, the Spanish Civil War, ending at an earlier point in the story, and that featured actor Juan Diego Botto as the pleasingly handsome and sexually adventurous young man (of whose naked flesh, alas, one beholds much less than one sees of Tom Berenger's in the earlier film). The Canadian movie itself may be rather neglected today, but it once was quite controversial and wildly successful (both by Canada's standards) and even helped in no small part to topple Ontario film censorship from its privileged but utterly prudish and barbaric position at the time (1978 was the year of release, the film dating 1977 in the end credits).For sure, one thing that makes the Canadian film so wildly enjoyable to see is the acting, in and (especially!) out of clothes, of Tom Berenger, the American actor brought in to play the lead male role. His physical beauty and smouldering sensuality are utterly captivating. One fortunately gets to see, as already implied, a lot of his bare flesh in this film, though never quite full frontally nude, his male genitalia (beyond pubic hair) only very fleetingly glimpsed. The women in his life as serial lover (played by variously Canadian and American actresses) from a false start in his childhood, then from age sixteen onwards, are a variable lot, but most of them very ""easy on the eyes"" and act from acceptably to very proficiently.Costing one million 1977 (Canadian) dollars to produce, the film was not a ""cheapie"" effort by any means, but it does somehow manage to look lower budget than really was the case. No matter; not to worry, for the film is highly enjoyable on its own terms and any faults can be chalked up to the Canadian film industry's relative immaturity at the time. The film, both Budapest and Montr&eacute;al scenes, was filmed alike on sets and on location in Montr&eacute;al.The film is of more than merely historical interest. Get one of the DVD editions (of which this viewer has it widescreen as ThinkFilm TF-11605). It would have helped a bit to have subtitles available, for even for someone increasingly hard of hearing it nonetheless was possible to make out most (by far) of the English dialogue (and French spoken dialogue is an option). The featurette about the making of the film is rewardingly informative and detailed, a valuable ""extra"", indeed, for a DVD edition.",4,A Canadian Film from the 1970s That Still Is Enchantingly Sexy and a Lot of Fun to Watch,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,2907,"['Praise', 'Older', 'Women', 'had', 'momentous', 'part', 'play', 'helping', 'Canadian', 'film', 'industry', 'get', 'firmly', 'own', 'two', 'feet', 'novel', 'based', 'had', 'been', 'strong', 'seller', 'real', 'influence', 'Dominion', 'Canada', 'abroad', 'too', 'So', 'great', 'so', 'was', 'book', 'lasting', 'appeal', 'abroad', 'led', '1997', 'Spain', 'appearance', 'Lolafilms', 'zesty', 'less', 'daring', 'film', 'En', 'brazos', 'la', 'mujer', 'madura', 'Studio', 'Latino', 'DVD-22142-1', 'based', 'more', 'loosely', 'book', 'setting', 'action', 'Spain', 'just', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', 'ending', 'earlier', 'point', 'story', 'featured', 'actor', 'Juan', 'Diego', 'Botto', 'pleasingly', 'handsome', 'sexually', 'adventurous', 'young', 'man', 'naked', 'flesh', 'alas', 'one', 'beholds', 'much', 'less', 'one', 'sees', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'earlier', 'film', 'Canadian', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'rather', 'neglected', 'today', 'once', 'was', 'quite', 'controversial', 'wildly', 'successful', 'Canada', 'standards', 'even', 'helped', 'small', 'part', 'topple', 'Ontario', 'film', 'censorship', 'privileged', 'utterly', 'prudish', 'barbaric', 'position', 'time', '1978', 'was', 'year', 'release', 'film', 'dating', '1977', 'end', 'credits', '.For', 'sure', 'one', 'thing', 'Canadian', 'film', 'so', 'wildly', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'acting', 'especially', 'clothes', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'American', 'actor', 'brought', 'play', 'lead', 'male', 'role', 'physical', 'beauty', 'smouldering', 'sensuality', 'are', 'utterly', 'captivating', 'One', 'fortunately', 'see', 'already', 'implied', 'lot', 'bare', 'flesh', 'film', 'though', 'never', 'quite', 'full', 'frontally', 'nude', 'male', 'genitalia', 'pubic', 'hair', 'only', 'very', 'fleetingly', 'glimpsed', 'women', 'life', 'serial', 'lover', 'played', 'variously', 'Canadian', 'American', 'actresses', 'false', 'start', 'childhood', 'then', 'age', 'sixteen', 'onwards', 'are', 'variable', 'lot', 'most', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes', 'act', 'acceptably', 'very', 'proficiently.Costing', 'one', 'million', '1977', 'Canadian', 'dollars', 'produce', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'cheapie', 'effort', 'means', 'somehow', 'manage', 'look', 'lower', 'budget', 'really', 'was', 'case', 'matter', 'not', 'worry', 'film', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'terms', 'faults', 'can', 'be', 'chalked', 'up', 'Canadian', 'film', 'industry', 'relative', 'immaturity', 'time', 'film', 'Budapest', 'Montr', 'eacute', 'scenes', 'was', 'filmed', 'alike', 'sets', 'location', 'Montr', 'eacute', 'film', 'more', 'merely', 'historical', 'interest', 'Get', 'one', 'DVD', 'editions', 'viewer', 'widescreen', 'ThinkFilm', 'TF-11605', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'bit', 'have', 'subtitles', 'available', 'even', 'someone', 'increasingly', 'hard', 'hearing', 'nonetheless', 'was', 'possible', 'make', 'out', 'most', 'far', 'English', 'dialogue', 'French', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'option', 'featurette', 'making', 'film', 'rewardingly', 'informative', 'detailed', 'valuable', 'extra', 'indeed', 'DVD', 'edition']",In Praise of Older Women VHS

I expected something sensual and erotic; I expected Berenger to be exciting. Instead, I saw an awkward, clumsy, uncomfortable Berenger attempt to get it on with many women, and the dialogue and acting throughout were terrible. In addition, we see both the women's nudity and Tom's; he even flashes his kibbles and bits a couple of times moving around on the bed; again, it all seems awkward. This could've been so much better than it actually was; I know Berenger was playing someone a lot younger and a lot more inexperienced, but he had no passion or energy in this film at all.
