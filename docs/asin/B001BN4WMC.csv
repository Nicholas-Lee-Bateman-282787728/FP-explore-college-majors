1172695,A3TXDO9392M8NJ,B001BN4WMC,"Beth Amazon reviewer ""Ultravioletlove.com""","[0, 0]","In My DreamsThere were new twists and turns in the plots interwoven into the main ongoing plot of the season--the making of the movie of the book by Jenny Schecter. I didn't know it would be possible for the writers to make me dislike Jenny more than I already did coming into this season, but they managed it.  Although I disliked her more and more as the season wore on, by the end of the season, I ended up liking Jenny way better than her presumptuous protege who became Jenny's movie's nemesis.I was particularly moved by the drama that unfolded this season with Kit.  The way that was resolved brought me to tears.  The changes in Tasha's life were powerful and probably inevitable.  I loved the way the writers torqued the trial's conclusion.  I don't know how realistic it was (What am I saying?  This is Hollywood after all), but it was pretty drastic.There was a different pace to the writing in this season.  I'm not sure if it's because the story line is beginning to wind down or what.  But I did feel like in order to keep things sexy, they may be doing Shane an injustice by not allowing her to move beyond her father's shadow personality type.  They must feel as though they have to keep the sex levels high and hot in order to keep their ratings and who better to do this with than Shane?  So that's what they do.  More sex and hot, racy scenes even when they don't seem quite true to plot and character.While it isn't my favorite season, I still enjoyed season 5 very much.  It wasn't better or worse than other seasons, but it was different in mood and tone and all those nebulous elements that are hard to elucidate.  The pacing was definitely different, but I think the writing stays mostly true to their previous standards.",5,New twists & turns,1232323200,"01 19, 2009",2009,1745,"['DreamsThere', 'were', 'new', 'twists', 'turns', 'plots', 'interwoven', 'main', 'ongoing', 'plot', 'season', 'making', 'movie', 'book', 'Jenny', 'Schecter', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'be', 'possible', 'writers', 'make', 'dislike', 'Jenny', 'more', 'already', 'did', 'coming', 'season', 'managed', 'disliked', 'more', 'more', 'season', 'wore', 'end', 'season', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', 'Jenny', 'way', 'better', 'presumptuous', 'protege', 'who', 'became', 'Jenny', 'movie', 'nemesis.I', 'was', 'particularly', 'moved', 'drama', 'unfolded', 'season', 'Kit', 'way', 'was', 'resolved', 'brought', 'tears', 'changes', 'Tasha', 'life', 'were', 'powerful', 'probably', 'inevitable', 'loved', 'way', 'writers', 'torqued', 'trial', 'conclusion', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'realistic', 'was', 'What', 'am', 'saying', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'pretty', 'drastic.There', 'was', 'different', 'pace', 'writing', 'season', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'story', 'line', 'beginning', 'wind', 'down', 'what', 'did', 'feel', 'order', 'keep', 'things', 'sexy', 'may', 'be', 'doing', 'Shane', 'injustice', 'not', 'allowing', 'move', 'father', 'shadow', 'personality', 'type', 'must', 'feel', 'have', 'keep', 'sex', 'levels', 'high', 'hot', 'order', 'keep', 'ratings', 'who', 'better', 'do', 'Shane', 'So', 'what', 'do', 'More', 'sex', 'hot', 'racy', 'scenes', 'even', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'true', 'plot', 'character.While', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'season', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'season', '5', 'very', 'much', 'was', ""n't"", 'better', 'worse', 'other', 'seasons', 'was', 'different', 'mood', 'tone', 'nebulous', 'elements', 'are', 'hard', 'elucidate', 'pacing', 'was', 'definitely', 'different', 'think', 'writing', 'mostly', 'true', 'previous', 'standards']",The L Word: Season 5

But season 5, even though there were some shaky parts and a couple of eye rolls I made; I was impressed and entertained.  I loved many of the metaphors I never caught first watching it on Showtime.  So out of six seasons, this is one of the top three.  I do have to say though, and I've had this complaint with each DVD that has come out since season one...what is up with the ""bonus features""?  Why is there practically nothing from the show at all?  For one, I have to sit through a commercial for Showtime at the beginning of every single disk.  You can't skip over it, not allowed.  Then when you think you're looking for deleted scenes, gag reels, or any more juicy stuff you can get from the show - forget about it.  Not there.  You get 2 episodes of The Tudors.  There are some LGBT things on there, and an uh-huh her music video, which is great and all...but why nothing from the show...?  Did every scene film perfectly so there were no deleted or extended scenes?  Did not one person on set screw up or make a joke for a gag reel?  Come on.  All you have to offer are still photos of scenes from the show?  I could have easily just recorded the show onto DVD as I watched it on Showtime.
