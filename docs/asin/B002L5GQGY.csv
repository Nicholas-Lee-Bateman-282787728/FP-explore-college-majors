1275741,A2BJAET1P9QUGZ,B002L5GQGY,Baberufus,"[4, 5]","I agree that this is definitely the high point of Joe B.'s career, living out his dream of playing Royal Albert and jamming with God himself, Eric C. It's a great DVD, no question. But I think his Rockpalast was a little better, performance-wise.For starters, the sound quality is a little muddy due to the famous heavy reverb in that hall. It seems that the sound engineers could have dialed a little more room ambience out of the mix, especially on Joe's guitar. That heavy reverb worked as a great effect for a band like Cream, but they were just a three-piece band. Here, Joe's band is quite large, and some instruments just didn't seem to cut through quite enough. Joe's vocals sound somewhat tinny, as well. I know I'm being picky, it's just that I wasn't quite as blown away as much I thought I would be. And what happened to the guitar changing? It's almost all Les Pauls here. I loved how Joe strapped on a Strat for a song or two on the Rockpalast DVD for a change of sound--especially on Blues Deluxe. For me, that's a better song for a Strat, not a Paul. Not as much variety there as he's given us in the past.Eric's appearance was enjoyable, even if it was brief and to the point--there didn't seem to be lot of camaraderie between the two of them, aside from Joe's obvious excitement in having him appear onstage with him.The interview with Joe was fun to watch--he really is a funny guy. And the licks and shredding lines he whips out during the interview are just amazing!He played slide on only one song--ehh, not enough. He's a great slide player, but there wasn't enough of it. Again, Rockpalast features some of his greatest slide work.The best part of this DVD is the Just Got Paid cover interwoven with parts of Dazed and Confused...dynamite!So yeah, a little more guitar variety and a little better mix would have made it better, but overall a great DVD!",5,"Not as good as his Rockpalast DVD, but still five stars...",1255824000,"10 18, 2009",2009,1877,"['agree', 'definitely', 'high', 'point', 'Joe', 'B', 'career', 'living', 'out', 'dream', 'playing', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'jamming', 'God', 'Eric', 'C.', 'great', 'DVD', 'question', 'think', 'Rockpalast', 'was', 'little', 'better', 'performance-wise.For', 'starters', 'sound', 'quality', 'little', 'muddy', 'due', 'famous', 'heavy', 'reverb', 'hall', 'sound', 'engineers', 'could', 'have', 'dialed', 'little', 'more', 'room', 'ambience', 'mix', 'especially', 'Joe', 'guitar', 'heavy', 'reverb', 'worked', 'great', 'effect', 'band', 'Cream', 'were', 'just', 'three-piece', 'band', 'Here', 'Joe', 'band', 'quite', 'large', 'instruments', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'cut', 'quite', 'enough', 'Joe', 'vocals', 'sound', 'somewhat', 'tinny', 'as', 'well', 'know', ""'m"", 'being', 'picky', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'blown', 'away', 'much', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'happened', 'guitar', 'changing', 'almost', 'Les', 'Pauls', 'here', 'loved', 'how', 'Joe', 'strapped', 'Strat', 'song', 'two', 'Rockpalast', 'DVD', 'change', 'sound', 'especially', 'Blues', 'Deluxe', 'better', 'song', 'Strat', 'not', 'Paul', 'Not', 'much', 'variety', 'there', 'given', 'past.Eric', 'appearance', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'was', 'brief', 'point', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'lot', 'camaraderie', 'two', 'aside', 'Joe', 'obvious', 'excitement', 'having', 'appear', 'onstage', 'him.The', 'interview', 'Joe', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'really', 'funny', 'guy', 'licks', 'shredding', 'lines', 'out', 'interview', 'are', 'just', 'amazing', 'played', 'slide', 'only', 'one', 'song', 'ehh', 'not', 'enough', 'great', 'slide', 'player', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Again', 'Rockpalast', 'greatest', 'slide', 'work.The', 'best', 'part', 'DVD', 'Just', 'Got', 'Paid', 'cover', 'interwoven', 'parts', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'dynamite', 'So', 'yeah', 'little', 'more', 'guitar', 'variety', 'little', 'better', 'mix', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'great', 'DVD']",N/A

But there is something, despite all that technique and that voice that sounds like he's been chewing on glass for 40 years that just doesn't seem quite right.  As I write this, the Olympics are taking place and this concert is similar.  The Olympics are about training and discipline from a very young age, leading to that one shining moment, right?  Well, Joe wanted to play the Albert Hall and by god, he achieved the impossible.  With Clapton as his guest, no less.  But that's more about wish fulfillment than music.The music?  Five stars.  Not a missed note in 2 hours.  Utterly relaxed in front of 4500 people.  He barely looks at the guitar; no need.  Two drummers, perfectly synchronized.  Not exactly Ginger Baker on an inventive night but impressive precision.  In fact everything is simply perfect, right up to the end where Joe points his Flying V towards heaven in triumph.  A ""10.0"".

Bonamassa deserves to be a big name in the music business, not just in the blues field.Yeah, I knew this guy was a great guitarist but I never realized how good a singer he was until I played this DVD.

1275752,A2QZAFBSYPC93B,B002L5GQGY,dknight16,"[99, 102]","Watching this DVD, the same feeling kept washing over me, song after song.  It was a feeling of intense pride.  I've been witness to the ever expanding vision and hard work Joe Bonamassa has put into his music.  No artist over the last decade has captivated me quite like Joe has.  Each new release adds yet another layer.  And he never makes us wait too long for the next chapter.  I've been fortunate to see Joe perform live several times in a variety of venues.  Then came RAH.It's the biggest show of Joe's life and he most certainly is up for the occasion.  The venue is magnificent.  The crowd is completely engaged.  The band is as tight as Bogie's snare.  And Joe is on fire.  Having everything come together after 20 years has obvious special meaning to Joe.  But watching this document of what he has accomplished in my 6+ years as a Joe Bonamassa fan holds special meaning to me as well.  I've been an avid record collector and concert goer for over 30 years. In that time, I've never felt more proud to be a fan than I felt while watching this DVD.For the technical minded, you have the choice of 3 audio streams, Dolby stereo, Dolby 5.1 surround, Dolby DTS surround.  The intro sequence really builds up and sets the stage for the show.  Camera work is great and features not only well chosen shots of the artists, but within the context of an historic venue.  Edits/cuts/changes are appropriately restrained.  What may be most surprising of all is that they chose to not overly compress the video and cram it all on one disc.  230 minutes are spread across two discs.  This is how a music DVD should be!After having watched this DVD a few times now, I'd like to add a little more about the performance itself:- Joe translates live far, far better than most artists.  In my opinion, Joe is a brilliant live artist who happens to make great studio records too.  I can't decide if Joe's greatest strength is his phenomenal guitar playing or his amazing voice.  Both are simply incredible on this DVD.- I love what Carmine has added to the band over the last couple of years.  He brings a flowing musicality that perfectly complements rather than competes with Joe.  He is a talented veteran and it shows.  The Buddah statue is kinda cool too.- I was a little nervous when Joe made keyboards a permanent part of the band.  I listen to guitar based music to hear . . . the guitar.  But Rick is one crafty son of a gun.  He doubles Joe's guitar harmonies, adds mood and texture to the background, and does some very nice vocal harmonies on several songs.  He steps out here and there with some tasty piano parts that are quite enjoyable.  Rick has been a GREAT addition to the band.- Anyone who thinks the 2 drummer concept is gimicky needs to see this DVD.  Watching Bogie and Anton synchronize with each other was quite interesting.  It made me pay more attention to the drumming than I usually do, and gave me new found respect for the power and complexity that the drums add to Joe's music.- Oops.  I almost forgot about the horn section.  It reminded me how much I enjoyed the early 90's Gary Moore tours that included the Midnight Horns.  Here they are used with restraint so as not to crowd the songs which were generally not written with horn parts.  The sax solo during Asking Around For You is expecially nice.Great music DVDs need to complement the music with compelling visuals.  There are probably few scenes in the 200+ music DVDs I own that are as dramatic as when Joe climbs up on stage equipment and hoists the Flying V over his head at the conclusion of Just Got Paid with the camera shooting from behind him at floor level.  It gives me goose bumps every time I see it.",5,Our Proudest Moment,1254787200,"10 6, 2009",2009,3696,"['Watching', 'DVD', 'same', 'feeling', 'kept', 'washing', 'song', 'song', 'was', 'feeling', 'intense', 'pride', ""'ve"", 'been', 'witness', 'ever', 'expanding', 'vision', 'hard', 'work', 'Joe', 'Bonamassa', 'put', 'music', 'artist', 'last', 'decade', 'captivated', 'quite', 'Joe', 'new', 'release', 'yet', 'layer', 'never', 'wait', 'too', 'long', 'next', 'chapter', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fortunate', 'see', 'Joe', 'perform', 'live', 'several', 'times', 'variety', 'venues', 'Then', 'came', 'RAH.It', 'biggest', 'show', 'Joe', 'life', 'most', 'certainly', 'up', 'occasion', 'venue', 'magnificent', 'crowd', 'completely', 'engaged', 'band', 'as', 'tight', 'Bogie', 'snare', 'Joe', 'fire', 'Having', 'everything', 'come', 'together', '20', 'years', 'obvious', 'special', 'meaning', 'Joe', 'watching', 'document', 'what', 'accomplished', '6+', 'years', 'Joe', 'Bonamassa', 'fan', 'special', 'meaning', 'well', ""'ve"", 'been', 'avid', 'record', 'collector', 'concert', 'goer', '30', 'years', 'time', ""'ve"", 'never', 'felt', 'more', 'proud', 'be', 'fan', 'felt', 'watching', 'DVD.For', 'technical', 'minded', 'have', 'choice', '3', 'audio', 'streams', 'Dolby', 'stereo', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'surround', 'Dolby', 'DTS', 'surround', 'intro', 'sequence', 'really', 'up', 'stage', 'show', 'Camera', 'work', 'great', 'not', 'only', 'well', 'chosen', 'shots', 'artists', 'context', 'historic', 'venue', 'Edits/cuts/changes', 'are', 'appropriately', 'restrained', 'What', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'surprising', 'chose', 'not', 'overly', 'compress', 'video', 'cram', 'one', 'disc', '230', 'minutes', 'are', 'spread', 'two', 'discs', 'how', 'music', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'having', 'watched', 'DVD', 'few', 'times', 'now', ""'d"", 'like', 'add', 'little', 'more', 'performance', 'Joe', 'live', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'most', 'artists', 'opinion', 'Joe', 'brilliant', 'live', 'artist', 'who', 'make', 'great', 'studio', 'records', 'too', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'Joe', 'greatest', 'strength', 'phenomenal', 'guitar', 'playing', 'amazing', 'voice', 'are', 'simply', 'incredible', 'DVD.-', 'love', 'what', 'Carmine', 'added', 'band', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'flowing', 'musicality', 'perfectly', 'rather', 'competes', 'Joe', 'talented', 'veteran', 'Buddah', 'statue', 'kinda', 'cool', 'too.-', 'was', 'little', 'nervous', 'when', 'Joe', 'made', 'keyboards', 'permanent', 'part', 'band', 'listen', 'guitar', 'based', 'music', 'hear', 'guitar', 'Rick', 'one', 'crafty', 'son', 'gun', 'Joe', 'guitar', 'harmonies', 'mood', 'texture', 'background', 'very', 'nice', 'vocal', 'harmonies', 'several', 'songs', 'out', 'here', 'there', 'tasty', 'piano', 'parts', 'are', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'Rick', 'been', 'GREAT', 'addition', 'band.-', 'Anyone', 'who', '2', 'drummer', 'concept', 'gimicky', 'needs', 'see', 'DVD', 'Watching', 'Bogie', 'Anton', 'synchronize', 'other', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting', 'made', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'drumming', 'usually', 'do', 'gave', 'new', 'found', 'respect', 'power', 'complexity', 'drums', 'add', 'Joe', 'music.-', 'Oops', 'almost', 'forgot', 'horn', 'section', 'reminded', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'early', '90', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'included', 'Midnight', 'Horns', 'Here', 'are', 'used', 'restraint', 'so', 'not', 'crowd', 'songs', 'were', 'generally', 'not', 'written', 'horn', 'parts', 'sax', 'solo', 'Asking', 'Around', 'expecially', 'nice.Great', 'music', 'DVDs', 'need', 'complement', 'music', 'compelling', 'visuals', 'are', 'probably', 'few', 'scenes', '200+', 'music', 'DVDs', 'own', 'are', 'as', 'dramatic', 'when', 'Joe', 'up', 'stage', 'equipment', 'Flying', 'V', 'head', 'conclusion', 'Just', 'Got', 'Paid', 'camera', 'shooting', 'floor', 'level', 'goose', 'bumps', 'time', 'see']",N/A
1275753,AGA6B9FHJ6HY0,B002L5GQGY,D. McNevin,"[22, 23]","This man is extremely gifted. He writes great songs and plays one of the meanest guitars I've ever heard. His style is a combination of flashy, speed riffs and tasteful and soulfully played blues. He has really developed his own style and can belt out the vocals as well.This DVD is well produced, with some great shots of Joe as well as the entire band. I like that they don't have a never ending change of camera angles, but that when they do change the shot, it's done in a way that doesn't give you that dizzying feeling that you can't just sit back and enjoy the show.The audio production is extremely solid and well mixed with a perfect combination of dynamics and equalization that you don't always find on concert videos. The video production is a little on the hazy side in some shots and that effect is enhanced slightly by the blue lights on stage. Even with that said, it's still a pretty decent Blu-ray. On a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a 10 for the audio and a 8.5 on the video.The set list is quite a mix of faster and slower tunes. The highlights are Ballad of John Henry and the song that pulls off an impressive Led Zeppelin, ZZ Top medley.The DTS-MA mixdown is superb, with all the instruments placed as they should be and at the proper volume in the mix. The dual drummers adds another level of depth and foundation to the tunes and is also mixed into the audio track very well.All of the musicians are top notch and special guest Eric Clapton sits in on a version of Further on up the Road that is also well done with Joe and Eric trading licks back and forth.All in all, I'd say you can't miss with this show.

Quite simply, there has been no one even remotely like him since Stevie Ray Vaughan or Jimi Hendrix.  (Yes, Hendrix was a great blues guitarist -- many younger fans don't know that.)  But any comparisons are misleading, because Bonamassa is, as BB King has said, ""one of a kind.""Other reviewers have given you all the details -- I can only add that any serious blues collection is incomplete without this DVD and at least a couple of Bonamassa's albums (I recommend Black Rock and Live From Nowhere in Particular).But go see him yourself too, while he is still playing relatively small venues, and while tickets are relatively easy to find.

(Seems like it was done by the same folks who did the Cream reunion and Clapton-Winwood DVDs) and its always great to see a motivated Eric Clapton. If you are a FAN...you will love it.The BAD: The songs are weak. No memorable tunes in the lot. In my opinion, I think Joe ""oversings"" and ""over-emotes."" To me his singing is very ""contrived."" And he flat out overplays. ""guitarists disease"". For all of Joe's talents, his guitar playing lacks the true lyricism of  the genius of  Jeff Beck, whom he so clearly attempts to imitate. If you're gonna pay such homage to your heroes, unflattering comparison is inevitable.The UGLY: Ultimately this whole DVD falls flat. And WHY is it on 2 discs? All of this material would easily fit on one. I get the feeling that Joe is a very nice person but on stage he has NO charisma. When Bonamassa plays the well-worn 5 note blues cliche opening of ""Blues Deluxe"" I feel nothing. When BB plays the EXACT same notes, it can make me cry and laugh at the same time. For all the flash and speed and articulation and virtuosity, it all comes up so very....boring. The Yngwie Malmsteen of modern blues playing. Also when Claton guests the volume of Eric's guitar is about 60% of Joes in the mix. This is the case with every single guitar players DVD I have ever seen. when the guest comes out, his volume is always significantly less then the stars. I hate that. Joe obviously respects and loves Clapton but in the ""mixing"" of the sound I can absolutely guarantee the words ""turn him down."" were said. The whole show seems to sink under the weight of its own self-importance.

I own more than 60 concerts on DVD because my favorite thing to do on my days off when the wife's at work and my son is at daycare for his 3 hours is to take the volume of my AVM20 to around -14 db and listen to good music. SACD and DVD-audio have a place in my collection, but there's nothing like watching a good performance when the musicians are on fire and the performance is excellent.This is one of those concerts where the band was there to play a great concert for the fans, and they accomplished.From listening to the brief background documentary on Joe at the beginning of both discs (A nice touch, and not overdone), it has been Joe's dream to play the Royal Albert Hall for many years. This is a venue where many greats in music have played to countless thousands of audience members. Joe stands tall among those great players (Clapton, Pink Floyd, Tangerine Dream, Zepplin, and countless others.), and he certainly serves up one heck of a performance.Joe is a fantastic player, and wholey underappreciated on the music scene. Born, I believe, the same hear as Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Joe is one of a small handful of prodigy guitar players that have been popular over the last decade, but two differences are evident: Joe Bonamassa isn't a household name like the others, but Joe will be playing for audiences for the foreseable future because he is simply a spectacular performer and the fans want to hear him play.You've heard Johnny Lang and Kenny Wayne Shepherd on the radio, but have you heard Joe on the local airwaves? Amazingly the answer for me was 'no', and in my opinion as a musician myself, he is a better player than both Jonny and Kenny. I guess his agent just doesn't have the same connections, or that Joe's desire is simply to perform at his best playing the songs he wants to perform, instead of selling-out to a record label.You won't typically find a Joe Bonamassa cd or DVD at your local Best Buy, and this is a shame. I only heard of him through Amazon because his style is similar to other bands I enjoy. I can't thank the little ""Customers who bought this item also bought"" banner on Amazon enough. It has turned me on to a lot of music and musicians that I would have otherwise not heard.If you're a fan of blues and great guitar playing, don't pass up this DVD. Here's hoping I can see Joe play live in the next couple of years. In the meantime, when I need a fix of great music I'll put Joe Bonamassa Live From Royal Albert Hall in the DVD player and turn the volume up to concert levels. Simply Great stuff.A player who is already a legend to his fans, and who will be a legend to the masses when enough of his fans tell other's about his talent as a musician. Count me as one of his newest fans.....Update: Still the go to DVD concert for a lot of my get-togethers. I've now seen Joe in concert twice. It only makes me like this DVD that much more.

Joe B. lights up the guitar for this spectacular performance. He plays a few different styles, Eric Clapton being the main style he plays off of, that he acknowledges, and he incorporates his own style into the song set like a more seasoned veteran than he is. His guitar duet with the MAN himself shows this, I feel he outplayed EC on this particular song. That said, It's probably due to EC's age and his fingers just don't move as fast as they used to, in his prime, that might be different. The Audio and Video is as good as it gets for SD DVD.

Previous reviewers have suggested it is not.  The booklet and the disc label says DTS 5.1 Surround but it sounds uncompressed to me and I'll believe the decoded electrical signal as displayed.  In any case it sounds great.While I've heard and read about this 34 year old guy, to my knowledge I've not heard or seen him play until now.  That will change.  He's terrific.  Bonamassa is a Californian who started playing professionally at about 13.  He had always dreamed of playing with his idol, Eric Clapton and playing Albert Hall.  He does both here in this 2009 concert.  Backed by 2 killer drummers, a bass guitarist, a keyboard player and a 3 man horn section, Bonamassa rocks the house with his mostly blues-rock sound.  He plays about 8 or 9 different guitars and puts his stamp on each one.While it's all good a demo combo selection is ""Just Got Paid"" and one on the ""extras"" called ""Woke Up Dreaming.""  The later is a solo acoustic guitar selection opposed to the hard rocking end to his show (before encore).  Both are guitar shredding at its best.  While the crowds at Albert Hall always seem sedate compared to American audiences, they listen in their seats then roar to approval at the end of each number.  The direction in this concert film is first rate.  No quick cuts or edits.  The focus is on the instruments and the musicians.  The DTS-HD Master Audio is thunderous when cranked up.

Worth the price for Sloe Gin and Just Got Paid alone!But I found the whole endeavour rather overblown.  Bonamassa seems to hold too much reverence for the venue and the gravitas of playing it.  In 2009, he was not some up and comer - he was already one of the greats.  It only takes the two guest appearances - especially Clapton - to see that.  Indeed, the guest appearances are unnecessary and just drag down the rest of the show.Sound is great, the camera work is good, too.  One of the benefits of the big production is the fun of having both Anton and Bogie drumming and the horn section.  But - if you're a fan - and sitting with a giant smile splitting your face as you are wrapped up in this fine performance, take a look at the audience.  Why do they not share your joy?  It seems like most of them are season ticket holders to the London Philharmonic pops series and this was one of the series concerts.  Amazing lack of being in touch with this astounding music.  So 5 stars for the performance, but loses a star for pretension and the pathetic appreciation of the crowd.If you're a Bonamassa fan, then you should have this.

1275780,A13FBTZ8SO8T3D,B002L5GQGY,o dubhthaigh,"[5, 24]","I hate to be the spoiler here, but by his own admission in the yakety part of this disc, Joe thinks he might be a little ADD. He left out affected. Anyone who tells you, at the age of 32, that they have been working for 20 years to get to the Albert Hall is a ponce who should have hailed a cab and spared the rest of us the pretension. You were 12, you donkey. On top of that he sings like he's auditioning for Simon Cowell.Now that I have your attention, it comes down to this: he has dexterity to die for and an encycopaedic knowledge of his fingerboard, but his own compositions, at least the way he sings them, lack depth and soul. He hits all the notes letter perfect, and that's the problem. It's absolutely all technique. Again, by his own admission, he doesn't have the grasp of spacing - when to play and when not. In fact, having listened to this and Black Rock, I'm convinced he abhores a pause, and his leitmotif seems to be why play one note that says it all when at least 100 redundant ones can be shoved in the same bar. His playing reminds me of a player piano hooked up to supercharged turbine. Paul Weller correctly observed that you wouldn't even entertain the thought of walking onstage unless you had an oversized ego that screamed constantly for attention. The best effect a humility. The rest can be insufferable. My guess is this guy was a little monster from the jump and there's no getting the cow back in the barn at this point. Part of it for me is that it all sounds the same. All of it. There's no doubting his technical mastery and he can mimic the blues, but it IS mimicry. I think he ought to hire someone who could more authentically deliver the idiom, someone from Chicago or Northern Mississippi or the Louisiana delta, for example. Upstate suburban NY just doesn't have that same mojo going for it. The band is technically impressive as well, but I can't help feeling like I'm at David Letterman's show.At best, this is blue eyed blues, and like blue eyed soul, the calories are empty and the vanilla turns cloying. If you have trouble getting the difference, it's there in the cameos with Clapton and Paul Jones. Jones was lead singer and harmonica player for the original Manfredd Mann, a band that was way better at the blues than any of their Brit invasion contemporaries. That was due to the soul in Jones' voice and his command of the harp. He too had modelled his approach after veterans from the fields of the US, but working class Brits in the early Sixties found a lot in common with the pain and suffering and lack of prospects post WW2 as did many of those who shaped post war blues. They had a rigid class system instead of slavery, but they got the point. Not sure if Joe really is the measure of say, Asie Payton. You'll have to look him up on your own. In fact, Joe should look him up on his own and lay off the patently absurd remarks he makes about his own ""struggles."" Oy. Clapton is generous and has a sense of pacing and when not to play that you'd wish Bonamossa might learn from as well, but no, here comes the flood.Mind you, I have the same complaints with Tommy Emmanuel. There's no off button.Anyway, usually when I'm scratching my head in disbelief, it's a sure thing the artist in question will be successful beyond expectations. Good for him if that's the case.

1275786,A2YGVSTELYMSS5,B002L5GQGY,Robin C. Smith,"[1, 1]","I am not easily impressed, but Bonamassa really pulls the stops out here and produces a very powerful set. The guy has a superb powerful tone (one of the best I have heard - although of course this is as much a credit to the recording engineer as to him in this case). This is one of the best blues-rock DVDs I have seen.I don't give it five stars because (and I have said this before) I find his original songs to be less interesting and in my opinion a little melodically weak. There is nothing wrong with them, but they do not grip me. They are great to watch once or twice, but I find I then tend to skip to his awe-inspiring covers with some sense of relief. You will be lucky to ever see anyone touch his ""So many roads"", for example.Of course, all the ridiculous one-upmanship of the guitar community can be on show for these kinds of reviews. Is he an innovator like Eric Clapton or Peter Green or SRV? No he is not, but that is not his fault - and if he was he would not be playing electric guitar he'd be Moby or some such. JB is a great player and certainly takes his playing from Eric Clapton/Peter Green/Mick Taylor rather than SRV - it would also be rather difficult to imagine a more different player to him than Jeff Beck.",4,Great,1283990400,"09 9, 2010",2010,1238,"['am', 'not', 'easily', 'impressed', 'Bonamassa', 'really', 'stops', 'here', 'very', 'powerful', 'set', 'guy', 'superb', 'powerful', 'tone', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'heard', 'course', 'as', 'much', 'credit', 'recording', 'engineer', 'case', 'one', 'best', 'blues-rock', 'DVDs', 'have', 'seen.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'have', 'said', 'find', 'original', 'songs', 'be', 'less', 'interesting', 'opinion', 'little', 'melodically', 'weak', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'do', 'not', 'grip', 'are', 'great', 'watch', 'once', 'twice', 'find', 'then', 'tend', 'skip', 'awe-inspiring', 'covers', 'sense', 'relief', 'will', 'be', 'lucky', 'ever', 'see', 'anyone', 'touch', 'So', 'many', 'roads', 'example.Of', 'course', 'ridiculous', 'one-upmanship', 'guitar', 'community', 'can', 'be', 'show', 'kinds', 'reviews', 'innovator', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Peter', 'Green', 'SRV', 'not', 'not', 'fault', 'was', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'playing', 'electric', 'guitar', ""'d"", 'be', 'Moby', 'such', 'JB', 'great', 'player', 'certainly', 'playing', 'Eric', 'Clapton/Peter', 'Green/Mick', 'Taylor', 'rather', 'SRV', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'rather', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'more', 'different', 'player', 'Jeff', 'Beck']",N/A
1275787,AF1BRDDV3CHRM,B002L5GQGY,"Russell Moker ""Russell""","[2, 2]","I only started seriously listening to Joe Bonamassa during this year.  Initially I regarded him as just another wannabe guitar hero emulating the styles of Stevie Ray, EC and other noterary guitarists.  I've been listening to Jonny Lang and Kenny Wayne and I enjoy their stuff but nothing of theirs fairly compares to the electric excitement and fire that JB has to offer. I think Joe is an a world and league of his own.This DVD is an excellent showcase of the wide variety of styles he is capable of playing in concert or even during one of his solos.  He has obviously mastered the blues rock styles of his heros like Clapton and Page but if you listen and watch closely, you will hear country & western speed picking, dreamy acoustic guitar and jazz inspired licks.I'm not going to go into each song on this visual collection, but I want to mention what I regard as the two highlights of this video.  The first is a guest appearance by ""god"" himself, Eric Clapton.  How ironic that this relatively young guitar slinger who was inspired to play the electric guitar when, at age 10 or so, he watched Cream's farewell concert of 1968 recorded at the very same venue and told his father I'm going to play there someday. EC's appearance is akin to the Pope visiting St. Peter's whilst an up and coming young priest might be saying Mass . . . what an honor to be there.  What an incredible honor to have a life long resident of the Royal Albert Hall show up and play a song with you!The second piece of this DVD that really captured me is JB's high powered version of ZZ Top's ""Just Got Paid"" during which he makes a perfect segway into a Jimmy Page Led Zep medley.  And then he returns to the rockin' riff of the original tune just as seamlessly.  Although Joe can seemingly play anyone's solo note for note, his covers are elegant nods to the greats of classic rock while he languishes his own special blend of musical herb and spices to make such gems unmistakably his own.Given JB's guitar virtuosity, it is almost easy to overlook his vocal skills.  I think his voice is as distinctive and full of variable range to keep any listener attentive and entertained.  But what I love about Joe the most is his humbleness and humility.  In the interviews I have seen including those on this DVD, he remains accessible and in good humor despite his rise to stardom.This is an excellent piece of musical and visual entertainment.

1275788,A3PU2TKU7QXF3E,B002L5GQGY,RWM,"[2, 2]","I have kind of come into Joe Bonamassa backwards as far as owning any of his work.  Having watched a ton of him on You Tube from playing with Danny Gatton at 12 years old to Bloodline (those young guys were really good and talented, especially young Joey!) and up to this current ""RAH"" DVD concert.  In fact this ""Royal Albert Hall"" DVD was the first purchase for me and since have purchased the ""Blues Deluxe"" CD and ""Rockpalast"" DVD.  The ""Rockpalast"" DVD is exceptionally good and the not so good camera work did not bother me all that much just because Joe's Trio is really cookin' all the way threw from beginning to end.  From what I can hear and see he pretty much brings and delivers every time when he plays live.  As he has said ""I am an entertainer and basically want to give the paying audience their monies worth.""  After hearing the intro to the song ""Blues Deluxe"", that pretty much got me hooked since I am such a blues nut!  He just played here in my local area at a small venue this past week for 2 nights in a row and unfortunately I was not able go catch his act.  At least I have the DVD's to watch and enjoy.Okay, having said all that, this ""RAH"" DVD is so enjoyable to watch from beginning to end.  Currently I think Joe is trying to take his music to a little different area of sophistication for lack of a better word.  This dude has done the blazing trio thing (ie: ""Rockpalast"" DVD) for quite awhile up until this newer band with 3 horn players, a keyboard player and 2 drummers creating a totally different dimension.  We have to realize and remember Joe isn't really all that old being the ripe old age of 32.This ""RAH"" concert was a 20 year dream for him to play this venue and also to play the tune ""Further On Up The Road"" with Clapton being one of his early mentors.  When I first heard Stevie Ray Vaughan's ""Texas Flood"" album back in 1983, and SRV was only around 28 or 29 at that time, man I thought this guy was God sent with the blues taking such a back seat with all the crap music back then.  The late SRV's music career just took off after that and myself becoming a huge fan like all the other many blues fans out there.  I am not trying to compare the late great SRV to JB so much in musical styles or whatever, though JB has and can hit that vibe shockingly well from his early age to say the least, but in a way I also think Joe is sort of God sent if there is such a thing.Bonamassa comes off as a real nice guy and has the gift, talent and energy with what he shows in his guitar playing and singing.  He seems to be the sum of so many great past and present guitar players out there and still searching to find his own voice and groove.  That almost sounds like an oxymoron with what he has already accomplished.  I am sure we will see many sides of his talents as the years go bye and he sure has gotten my attention with his blues based style.  He's a natural as that old saying goes.  In closing, the last encore song ""Asking Around For You"" with horn arrangements etc.....for me it just doesn't get any better than that!  Superbly done and what a nice way to end the night of great music.",5,Very very good Blues / Rock............,1258070400,"11 13, 2009",2009,3140,"['have', 'kind', 'come', 'Joe', 'Bonamassa', 'backwards', 'as', 'far', 'owning', 'work', 'Having', 'watched', 'ton', 'Tube', 'playing', 'Danny', 'Gatton', '12', 'years', 'old', 'Bloodline', 'young', 'guys', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'talented', 'especially', 'young', 'Joey', 'up', 'current', 'RAH', 'DVD', 'concert', 'fact', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'DVD', 'was', 'first', 'purchase', 'have', 'purchased', 'Blues', 'Deluxe', 'CD', 'Rockpalast', 'DVD', 'Rockpalast', 'DVD', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'camera', 'work', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'that', 'much', 'just', 'Joe', 'Trio', 'really', 'cookin', 'way', 'threw', 'beginning', 'end', 'what', 'can', 'hear', 'see', 'pretty', 'much', 'brings', 'delivers', 'time', 'when', 'live', 'said', 'am', 'entertainer', 'basically', 'want', 'give', 'paying', 'audience', 'monies', 'hearing', 'intro', 'song', 'Blues', 'Deluxe', 'pretty', 'much', 'got', 'hooked', 'am', 'blues', 'nut', 'just', 'played', 'here', 'local', 'area', 'small', 'venue', 'past', 'week', '2', 'nights', 'row', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'go', 'catch', 'act', 'least', 'have', 'DVD', 'watch', 'enjoy.Okay', 'having', 'said', 'RAH', 'DVD', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'beginning', 'end', 'Currently', 'think', 'Joe', 'trying', 'take', 'music', 'little', 'different', 'area', 'sophistication', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'dude', 'done', 'blazing', 'trio', 'thing', 'ie', 'Rockpalast', 'DVD', 'quite', 'awhile', 'up', 'newer', 'band', '3', 'horn', 'players', 'keyboard', 'player', '2', 'drummers', 'creating', 'totally', 'different', 'dimension', 'have', 'realize', 'remember', 'Joe', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'old', 'being', 'ripe', 'old', 'age', '32.This', 'RAH', 'concert', 'was', '20', 'year', 'dream', 'play', 'venue', 'also', 'play', 'tune', 'Further', 'Road', 'Clapton', 'being', 'one', 'early', 'mentors', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'Stevie', 'Ray', 'Vaughan', 'Texas', 'Flood', 'album', 'back', '1983', 'SRV', 'was', 'only', 'around', '28', '29', 'time', 'man', 'thought', 'guy', 'was', 'God', 'sent', 'blues', 'taking', 'such', 'back', 'seat', 'crap', 'music', 'back', 'then', 'late', 'SRV', 'music', 'career', 'just', 'took', 'off', 'becoming', 'huge', 'fan', 'other', 'many', 'blues', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'am', 'not', 'trying', 'compare', 'late', 'great', 'SRV', 'JB', 'so', 'much', 'musical', 'styles', 'whatever', 'JB', 'can', 'hit', 'vibe', 'shockingly', 'well', 'early', 'age', 'say', 'least', 'way', 'also', 'think', 'Joe', 'sort', 'God', 'sent', 'such', 'thing.Bonamassa', 'off', 'real', 'nice', 'guy', 'gift', 'talent', 'energy', 'what', 'guitar', 'playing', 'singing', 'be', 'sum', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'past', 'present', 'guitar', 'players', 'there', 'still', 'searching', 'find', 'own', 'voice', 'groove', 'almost', 'oxymoron', 'what', 'already', 'accomplished', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'see', 'many', 'sides', 'talents', 'years', 'go', 'bye', 'sure', 'gotten', 'attention', 'blues', 'based', 'style', 'natural', 'old', 'saying', 'closing', 'last', 'encore', 'song', 'Asking', 'Around', 'horn', 'arrangements', 'etc', '..for', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'Superbly', 'done', 'what', 'nice', 'way', 'end', 'night', 'great', 'music']",N/A

At the age of twelve he opened for blues legend B.B. King.This RAH Concert is the realization of a life long dream for Joe and after 20 years of dedication and hard work he has made it.This two disc set is flawless from the content to the camera work. I felt like I was there, glowing with pride as Joe reached the pinnacle of his career.This is not only a magical moment for Joe, but for all his fans, including myself. On May 4th, 2009 during this historic concert, the circle would be completed when Mr. Eric Clapton passes on the torch to the future blues-rock guitar god of the world  Mr. Joe Bonamassa.You can see it in Eric's eyes and demeanor. The look of pride and respect, the smile pasted across his face. And if you are passing the torch, who better to be on the receiving end than Joe. A person who deserves, has worked for and will respect his new position.I will not go through the highlights of the concert as it is all ONE BIG HIGHLIGHT. From start to finish this is excellence.",5,"Congratulations Joe, You Made It",1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,1395,"['Joe', 'Bonamassa', 'born', 'Robert', 'Johnson', 'birthday', 'May', '8th', '1977', 'Utica', 'New', 'York.As', 'story', 'Cream', 'Farewell', 'video', 'was', 'defining', 'moment', 'Joe', 'life', 'Joe', 'said', 'wanted', 'learn', 'guitar', 'planned', 'play', 'RAH', 'one', 'day', 'hero', 'Eric', 'Clapton.Starting', 'age', 'five', 'most', 'boys', 'age', 'were', 'out', 'climbing', 'trees', 'Joe', 'was', 'spending', 'countless', 'hours', 'practicing', 'guitar', 'age', 'twelve', 'opened', 'blues', 'legend', 'B.B', 'King.This', 'RAH', 'Concert', 'realization', 'life', 'long', 'dream', 'Joe', '20', 'years', 'dedication', 'hard', 'work', 'made', 'it.This', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'flawless', 'content', 'camera', 'work', 'felt', 'was', 'there', 'glowing', 'pride', 'Joe', 'reached', 'pinnacle', 'career.This', 'not', 'only', 'magical', 'moment', 'Joe', 'fans', 'including', 'May', '4th', '2009', 'historic', 'concert', 'circle', 'would', 'be', 'completed', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'torch', 'future', 'blues-rock', 'guitar', 'god', 'world', 'Mr.', 'Joe', 'Bonamassa.You', 'can', 'see', 'Eric', 'eyes', 'demeanor', 'look', 'pride', 'respect', 'smile', 'pasted', 'face', 'are', 'passing', 'torch', 'who', 'better', 'be', 'receiving', 'end', 'Joe', 'A', 'person', 'who', 'worked', 'will', 'respect', 'new', 'position.I', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'highlights', 'concert', 'ONE', 'BIG', 'HIGHLIGHT', 'start', 'finish', 'excellence']",N/A
