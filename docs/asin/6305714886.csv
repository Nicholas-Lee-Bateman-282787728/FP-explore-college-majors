Amazing performances are given by all the actors, particularly Claire Danes.  Her work honestly deserves an oscar...esp. if Julia Roberts can get one.  This movie is about the torturous possibility of betrayal by a friend...and the fearful possibility of having your young and innocent life taken with no cause.

I was mostly amazed by Danes performance and how her portal of her character and the deep emotion of friendship and saving her best friend's life.There not a moment where I didn't shed a tear or two near the end. I recommend to anyone to buy or even rent this film. It kind of made me think about my friendship with some of my friends and including my best friend that I haven't seen in years now.It's a film about how two best friends want to spend their summer with each other one last time before college. They take a trip to somewhere different than where they were suppose to go, bumped into someone that seemed nice and soon gets into trouble by getting caught with drugs at the airport in a foreign place.

I love her character here playing the innocent and easily maninupulated character Alice compared to Darlene, the stronger and street-wise friend played by Claire Danes. Watching this film I can't help but remind myself of my own friedship with my best friend. No we didn't end up in jail but the things that they'll do for each other is in itself beautiful and heartfelt.I look at this film as a lesson for anyone travelling to an unfamiliar country. How many times that we have to remind ourselves never to trust stangers, let alone spend a night with them.

473963,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305714886,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","I remember when this movie first came out.  I was dying to see it for at the time Claire Danes was just everything I thought I wanted in a woman and so I just had to see every film she accompanied.  Then, about two weeks in it was yanked from each and every theater in my area and I had to wait the long haul to video before I could see it.  I'm sure it goes without saying that the date of its release I was at my local video store swooping up a copy.  I know that the film has taken its share of hits but in all honestly `Brokedown Palace' is a very compelling, believable and emotional film.  I'm actually shocked by any and all negative comments.  The entire cast, mostly Danes, really invest all they have into their characters and the story is so heartbreakingly real I urged to recommend this film and any and everyone.The film follows two close friends, Alice and Darlene, as they slip away to share one last rendezvous before college.  Alice has always been the wild child.  She grew up in a broken home and thus lives her life on the edge and foolishly.  Darlene on the other hand has always been more sheltered by her upstanding and strict parents and so she's much more reluctant to ditch their plans for Hawaii for a getaway to Thailand.  Alice is very persuasive and so before she knows it Darlene has lied to her parents and hopped a plane to Asia with her partner in crime.  Their accommodations are far from homey but it's an experience they'll never forget.  Soon though, that experience turns sour.  After a chance meeting with a handsome Australian the girls find themselves in possession of heroin and in the hands of the Thai court system.  I've always heard rumors of the strict and oppressive laws in the Orient, especially towards foreigners but here their customs and judgments are harshly exposed.The girls find themselves sentenced to 33 years in prison with no way to get out despite the effort on the part of Darlene's father.  Alice enlists the help of American lawyer Hank, played by Bill Pullman, a man who comes across a little money hungry in the beginning but by the end unveils his true caring colors  The film covers the girls fight for freedom, their fight for understanding and their fight amongst themselves to stay grounded.  The girl's relationship is fleshed out extremely well and is very believable.  While Alice and Darlene are best friends they are also very different people and as the blame game starts to set in they find themselves tearing away from one another in an effort to establish innocence.The performances are strong, but Claire Danes shines so brightly here it's ridiculous.  Her character is so unbelievable real, so raw and understandable that I break down in tears almost every time I watch this film.  The scenes where she begs her father for money or pleads on her knees for an act of kindness are so heartbreaking, so devastating.  Claire Danes has proven herself time and time again that she is one of our finest young talents.  I'm still angered at the fact that the Academy fails to recognize her despite her consistent brilliance.  They've had plenty of chances (`Little Women' being the most Oscar friendly I would assume), this performance included, yet they continue to pass her over.  Alas, at least we can sit back and relish in the very concept of her immense talent.",5,Impressive drama truly stands up and delivers...,1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,3345,"['remember', 'when', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'dying', 'see', 'time', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'was', 'just', 'everything', 'thought', 'wanted', 'woman', 'so', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'film', 'accompanied', 'Then', 'about', 'two', 'weeks', 'was', 'yanked', 'theater', 'area', 'had', 'wait', 'long', 'haul', 'video', 'could', 'see', ""'m"", 'sure', 'saying', 'date', 'release', 'was', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'swooping', 'up', 'copy', 'know', 'film', 'taken', 'share', 'hits', 'honestly', 'Brokedown', 'Palace', 'very', 'compelling', 'believable', 'emotional', 'film', ""'m"", 'actually', 'shocked', 'negative', 'comments', 'entire', 'cast', 'mostly', 'Danes', 'really', 'invest', 'have', 'characters', 'story', 'so', 'heartbreakingly', 'real', 'urged', 'recommend', 'film', 'everyone.The', 'film', 'two', 'close', 'friends', 'Alice', 'Darlene', 'slip', 'away', 'share', 'one', 'last', 'rendezvous', 'college', 'Alice', 'always', 'been', 'wild', 'child', 'grew', 'up', 'broken', 'home', 'thus', 'life', 'edge', 'foolishly', 'Darlene', 'other', 'hand', 'always', 'been', 'more', 'sheltered', 'upstanding', 'strict', 'parents', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'reluctant', 'ditch', 'plans', 'Hawaii', 'getaway', 'Thailand', 'Alice', 'very', 'persuasive', 'so', 'Darlene', 'lied', 'parents', 'hopped', 'plane', 'Asia', 'partner', 'crime', 'accommodations', 'are', 'far', 'homey', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'Soon', 'experience', 'sour', 'chance', 'meeting', 'handsome', 'Australian', 'girls', 'find', 'possession', 'heroin', 'hands', 'Thai', 'court', 'system', ""'ve"", 'always', 'heard', 'rumors', 'strict', 'oppressive', 'laws', 'Orient', 'especially', 'towards', 'foreigners', 'here', 'customs', 'judgments', 'are', 'harshly', 'exposed.The', 'girls', 'find', 'sentenced', '33', 'years', 'prison', 'way', 'get', 'out', 'effort', 'part', 'Darlene', 'father', 'Alice', 'help', 'American', 'lawyer', 'Hank', 'played', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'man', 'who', 'little', 'money', 'hungry', 'beginning', 'end', 'true', 'caring', 'colors', 'film', 'girls', 'fight', 'freedom', 'fight', 'understanding', 'fight', 'amongst', 'stay', 'grounded', 'girl', 'relationship', 'fleshed', 'out', 'extremely', 'well', 'very', 'believable', 'Alice', 'Darlene', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'blame', 'game', 'set', 'find', 'tearing', 'away', 'one', 'effort', 'establish', 'innocence.The', 'performances', 'are', 'strong', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'shines', 'so', 'brightly', 'here', 'ridiculous', 'character', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'real', 'raw', 'understandable', 'break', 'down', 'tears', 'almost', 'time', 'watch', 'film', 'scenes', 'where', 'father', 'money', 'pleads', 'knees', 'act', 'kindness', 'are', 'so', 'heartbreaking', 'so', 'devastating', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'proven', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'one', 'finest', 'young', 'talents', ""'m"", 'still', 'angered', 'fact', 'Academy', 'recognize', 'consistent', 'brilliance', ""'ve"", 'had', 'plenty', 'chances', 'Little', 'Women', 'being', 'most', 'Oscar', 'friendly', 'would', 'assume', 'performance', 'included', 'yet', 'continue', 'pass', 'over', 'Alas', 'least', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'relish', 'very', 'concept', 'immense', 'talent']",Brokedown Palace

How would you explain yourself if you can't even speak or understand their language?  Well, that's the story with this movie.  Two girls are found with drugs in their backpack on the way to Hong Kong.  Neither girl was aware they were carrying drugs- they were set up by another person.  The girls feel confident there must be some kind of misunderstanding and plead their innocence to just about every single person they can but... nobody believes them.  It's up to a lawyer and the support of a loving father (of one of the girls) to get them out of there.  It's a really unfortunate situation to find yourself in.The final 10 minutes are not only surprising, but *unbelievably* emotional.  I wasn't expecting... that, at all.A couple things didn't quite add up, though.  I felt that the first time the one father visited his daughter by standing across a balcony and screaming towards her was totally awkward.  He should have been really sad that his daughter was trapped in a foreign prison for a crime she didn't commit.  That would have been a more believable reaction.  Instead, he was overly confident for no reason.  Even worse, this same father -without even knowing the story- is too quick to assume that his daughters friend is a no good troublemaker responsible for the two of them being locked up.Perhaps the actual prison aspect wasn't developed entirely either- there should have been a few conflicts brewing involving the two girls and one of the female prisoners who obviously took exception (on a few occasions) to the girls being there.  Oh and perhaps the person who set them up should have made a reappearance in some context but... he never did.

473968,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6305714886,Bobby Underwood,"[34, 39]","Dismissed by some as lightweight because they felt the Thailand prison scenes were not brutal enough, this is actually a terrific film about the complex friendship of two girls and a sacrifice made by one to save the other. Claire Danes gives a great performance as the girl most likely to get into trouble and Kate Beckinsale shines as the good girl who sees more in her friend than her parents do, especially her father.After graduating high school they cook up a scheme to visit exotic Thailand on the cheap and do something special, telling Beckinsale's parents they are off to Hawaii. They meet Aussie Daniel Lapaine and he charms both girls into going to Hong Kong with them to continue their adventure. Jealousy plays a part as it is unclear at first which one he likes the best. But all is not as it seems and he disappears just as heroin is found by customs in their backpack.What follows as they are imprisoned in Thailand with seemingly no way out as each begins to question their friendship and wonder if maybe, just maybe, the other one knew about the heroin, is compelling. Beckinsale's father comes to Thailand and, of course, blames Danes for getting his daughter into this mess. Danes does a good job at conveying the hurt she is trying not to show for the faith no one has ever shown in her, except for her friend Beckinsale.Bill Pullman gives a solid performance as a slightly opportunistic and sleazy lawyer in Thailand who may be able to help them get out for a price. Adding to the atmosphere is a soundtrack just as exotic as the locale. Everything from Delerium's ""Silence"" and a remake of ""Rock the Casbah"" to the beautiful voice of  Sarah Brightman on ""Deliverance"" set a unique mood for a good film.This is an entertaining and thought provoking meditation on friendship and loyalty. A sacrifice by one to save the other is one you'll never forget. Beckinsale, and especially Danes, really sparkle in an unusual film you won't want to miss. Pick this one up.

473969,A8TM0MI3D9T29,6305714886,Brett Corkins,"[6, 7]","I bought this just the other day based on all the high recommendations that were being given to it, and not to mention all the reviews that cited how good the acting was. Ever since I saw Igby Goes Down I've been a pretty big fan of Claire Danes (minus the horrific T3), and I also really like Kate Beckinsale so I figured I'd try it. As the credits started to roll at the end of the film I found myself shocked at how amazing this movie was. Not only was the acting magnificent, the plot was also top notch. Who isn't afraid that someone stashed something in their bag without them knowing it when they go to the airport? Who isn't afraid of foreign prisons? Who isn't afraid of prison in general? This is where this movie shines, putting those fears on film.We start off at Alice and Darlene's high school graduation. They decide to go to Hawaii for vacation but then hear how amazing it is in Thailand, so, at the last minute, change their minds. Everything seems fine until Alice and Darlene meet a mysterious man. He offers to fly the two out to Hong Kong so they can hang out for a while longer, and after some coaxing a reluctant Alice decides to go. But while in line at the airport they are detained for trying to smuggle drugs onto a plane. This is where the movie is put into a league of it's own. In some movies you can tell it's just acting, but in this you really feel that these two are really going through this horrid ordeal.With supurb acting from everyone involved, and a cast of familiar faces, you can't go wrong. Even Lou Diamond Phillips, in his short time on film, does a great job. But the real kudos go to Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale.

It's hard to say just what director Jonathan Kaplan might have done differently to make this promising movie an outstanding movie.  But maybe it has something to do with the wrong kind of detail, the accumulated effects thereof.First we have the sight of the pretty American girls, just out of high school, Alice Marano (Claire Danes) and Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale) dressed in USA young miss outfits that show off their figures like models on a runway.  You'd think they would dress down a little for the natives, remembering that when in Rome do as the Romans do.  I've watched the Globe Trekker on PBS and the young women there never wear tight skirts and lipstick.  The girls prance about the streets of Thailand on display as though looking for Mr. Right.Well, of course this being the nineties and not the fifties, they instead find Mr. Wrong.  He charms them and divides them by invoking jealousy, the one of the other.  All of this makes for an interesting premise.  And then we have a nice (if predictable) twist, and the girls end up in prison.The prison sets are beautiful in a dark and somber way, full of open spaces and diffused colors, guards in pressed uniforms, the other prisoners mostly healthy--pretty even--in clean uniforms with neat tags like charms hanging from the necks.  The fruits and vegetables stacked in the corner of the mess area that the girls are tricked into sampling are fresh and attractive.  Strange.  A palace as a prison.Somehow--perhaps it was the beauty of the sets--I never really felt the kind of outrage and horror and near hopelessness that such a situation might evoke.  It seemed clear that everything would work out, and the girls would go home soon, leaving the misadventure behind them.That is not exactly what happens.See this for Claire Danes who gives a fine performance and almost sells the not-entirely plausible ending.",3,Don't let this happen to you,1045612800,"02 19, 2003",2003,2129,"['story', 'friendship', 'tested', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'engaging', 'sets', 'are', 'beautiful', 'acting', 'good', 'excellent', 'somehow', 'tale', 'two', 'American', 'girls', 'unjustly', 'jailed', 'drug', 'tracking', 'Thailand', ""n't"", 'quite', 'convince', 'hard', 'say', 'just', 'what', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Kaplan', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'differently', 'make', 'promising', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'maybe', 'something', 'do', 'wrong', 'kind', 'detail', 'accumulated', 'effects', 'have', 'sight', 'pretty', 'American', 'girls', 'just', 'high', 'school', 'Alice', 'Marano', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Darlene', 'Davis', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'dressed', 'USA', 'young', 'miss', 'show', 'off', 'figures', 'models', 'runway', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'dress', 'down', 'little', 'natives', 'remembering', 'when', 'Rome', 'do', 'Romans', 'do', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Globe', 'Trekker', 'PBS', 'young', 'women', 'there', 'never', 'wear', 'tight', 'skirts', 'lipstick', 'girls', 'prance', 'streets', 'Thailand', 'display', 'looking', 'Mr.', 'Right.Well', 'course', 'being', 'nineties', 'not', 'fifties', 'instead', 'find', 'Mr.', 'Wrong', 'divides', 'invoking', 'jealousy', 'one', 'other', 'interesting', 'premise', 'then', 'have', 'nice', 'predictable', 'twist', 'girls', 'end', 'up', 'prison.The', 'prison', 'sets', 'are', 'beautiful', 'dark', 'somber', 'way', 'full', 'open', 'spaces', 'diffused', 'colors', 'guards', 'pressed', 'uniforms', 'other', 'prisoners', 'mostly', 'healthy', 'pretty', 'even', 'clean', 'uniforms', 'neat', 'tags', 'charms', 'hanging', 'necks', 'fruits', 'vegetables', 'stacked', 'corner', 'mess', 'area', 'girls', 'are', 'tricked', 'sampling', 'are', 'fresh', 'attractive', 'Strange', 'A', 'palace', 'prison.Somehow', 'perhaps', 'was', 'beauty', 'sets', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'kind', 'outrage', 'horror', 'hopelessness', 'situation', 'might', 'evoke', 'seemed', 'clear', 'everything', 'would', 'work', 'out', 'girls', 'would', 'go', 'home', 'soon', 'leaving', 'misadventure', 'them.That', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'happens.See', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'who', 'fine', 'performance', 'almost', 'not-entirely', 'plausible', 'ending']",Brokedown Palace

The characters, portrayed by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale, are going to be friends for life even if they slowly, eventually drift apart.  For a final trip together they decide not to go the safe, routine route of going to Hawaii, again, and want something different, perhaps a little adventurous, so they decide on Thailand.  While there they meet a charismatic, only slightly mysterious man on their trip and are both immediately enamored with him; and the jealousy starts to seep in.  In the midst of this subtle, female power struggle they are both conned and subsequently accused of smuggling narcotics and sent to jail. One poor decision after another and they are spinning helplessly down the drain.  It's always the more realistic tales of decent people caught up and tossed about by circumstance that are more frightening to me than the Hollywood horror-fests with aliens and gore.  There are many intense scenes throughout this film that had me caring about the principle actors and how were they ever going to get out of this horrible and unfair situation.  Claire Danes deserves top billing as she plays an average girl trapped in an unthinkable scenario, whereas everyone watching can relate to her emotional state at any given time.  She is truly a talent.  Kate Beckinsale nearly reaches the same level of intensity playing the all-American daddy's girl caught up in the chaos.  For that matter, when the two leads are playing off one another the chemistry is equally excellent.  Bill Pullman makes his presence felt with a conscience-stricken, kind-hearted turn as their lawyer.  There are even a handful of supporting characters that are memorable which makes this a veritable feast of character actors.

Litton,"[2, 5]","I know what you were thinking when you saw the trailer or movie poster for this movie: another teen-girl flick that acts as a star vehicle for it's two lead actresses. Wrong. Brokedown Palace is far from being a juvenile  movie; it takes real issues into it's hands and plays those issues out  through the emotions and actions of the characters and their surroundings.  Claire Danes plays Alice, a wild, impulsive girl who, with her more  reserved friend, graduates from high school in the movie's beginning.  Darlene, played by Kate Beckinsdale, is skeptical when Alice suggests going  to Thailand instead of Maui, but goes with er anyway. Upon their arrival,  they spend their days basking in the sun, touring the streets of Bangkok,  and pretending to be guests at an expensive hotel, where they meet a man by  the name of Nick Parks. Both girls, of course, fall for him, with Darlene  ultimately winning out in the end. This puts a small wrench in their  friendship, which is played into as the film progresses. After agreeing to  go to Hong Kong with him, the two girls are arrested without warning from  the airport, accused to attempted narcotic smuggling. This is the point at  which the film's pace quickens dramatically, with the girl's going through  the ins and outs of prison life and trying to get in touch with Yankee  Hank, an American lawyer, played by Bill Pullman. While the story itself  does have a credible amount of tension and emotion, it is the performances  from Danes and Beckinsdale that make the movie a success. The two actresses  play their parts with a large degree of originality, and Pullman's  performance also delivers. Sequences in the Thai prison appear authentic in  nature, and it looks like the filmmakers did their homework before putting  these scenes together. The film is not one that should be dismissed on the  basis of it's appearance, for that can be deceiving. The DVD edition of the  film is lacking, however, in sound quality. Audio jumps for a second in  three different places in the movie, and the overall movie seems to sound a  little lower in volume than most other DVDs.",4,Stellar performances make the movie worthwhile.,963964800,"07 19, 2000",2000,2129,"['know', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'when', 'saw', 'trailer', 'movie', 'poster', 'movie', 'teen-girl', 'flick', 'star', 'vehicle', 'two', 'lead', 'actresses', 'Wrong', 'Brokedown', 'Palace', 'far', 'being', 'juvenile', 'movie', 'real', 'issues', 'hands', 'plays', 'issues', 'out', 'emotions', 'actions', 'characters', 'surroundings', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Alice', 'wild', 'impulsive', 'girl', 'who', 'more', 'reserved', 'friend', 'high', 'school', 'movie', 'beginning', 'Darlene', 'played', 'Kate', 'Beckinsdale', 'skeptical', 'when', 'Alice', 'going', 'Thailand', 'instead', 'Maui', 'anyway', 'arrival', 'spend', 'days', 'basking', 'sun', 'touring', 'streets', 'Bangkok', 'pretending', 'be', 'guests', 'expensive', 'hotel', 'where', 'meet', 'man', 'name', 'Nick', 'Parks', 'girls', 'course', 'fall', 'Darlene', 'ultimately', 'winning', 'out', 'end', 'small', 'wrench', 'friendship', 'played', 'film', 'progresses', 'agreeing', 'go', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'two', 'girls', 'are', 'arrested', 'warning', 'airport', 'accused', 'attempted', 'narcotic', 'smuggling', 'point', 'film', 'pace', 'dramatically', 'girl', 'going', 'ins', 'outs', 'prison', 'life', 'trying', 'get', 'touch', 'Yankee', 'Hank', 'American', 'lawyer', 'played', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'story', 'have', 'credible', 'amount', 'tension', 'emotion', 'performances', 'Danes', 'Beckinsdale', 'make', 'movie', 'success', 'two', 'actresses', 'play', 'parts', 'large', 'degree', 'originality', 'Pullman', 'performance', 'also', 'Sequences', 'Thai', 'prison', 'appear', 'authentic', 'nature', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'homework', 'putting', 'scenes', 'together', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'dismissed', 'basis', 'appearance', 'can', 'be', 'deceiving', 'DVD', 'edition', 'film', 'lacking', 'however', 'sound', 'quality', 'Audio', 'jumps', 'second', 'three', 'different', 'places', 'movie', 'overall', 'movie', 'sound', 'little', 'lower', 'volume', 'most', 'other', 'DVDs']",Brokedown Palace

It seems like a fun time of touring an exotic land, until they meet an attractive  stranger who seduces them into taking a trip to Hong Kong and puts drugs in  their luggage.  They get nabbed by the local police and find that justice  in Asia is very different from justice in the U.S.This is the main story  line for &quot;Brokedown Palace&quot; and it was a good one.  The film does  a decent job of portraying the arbitrary and corrupt justice systems of  third world nations.  Actually, the portrayal was rather mild, as the  prison conditions are often far worse than depicted.  It serves as a  reminder that no matter how bad we think our justice system is, it is  pristine by comparison to much of the rest of the world.Unfortunately,  there were too many contrived situations in the film that hampered the  story.  The whole escape attempt was bogus fantasy.  To think that friends  would be able to smuggle money for a bribe into the prison in a padded bra,  and not be discovered by the guards who were systematically checking  everything brought in from visitors, assumes that either the guards or the  viewers are utter blockheads.The story also fails to bring closure to  the nagging question of how the drugs got in Alice's (Claire Danes)  backpack.  Did she actually agree to transport the drugs?  We are left to  guess.  It was intriguing to be kept guessing about the girls' innocence  throughout the film, but we finish the movie never really knowing if one or  both of the girls might be guilty.  Except for this considerable flaw, the  ending was excellent and the results unexpected.The acting by Claire  Danes and Kate Beckinsale was very solid and well done.  Danes, who has  been oversold and over hyped, actually arrived as an actor in this film.  Though her portrayal was frequently immature (as was her character), she  improved as the film progressed and the circumstances became more dire.  Beckinsale, in contrast has been flying under the radar her whole brief  career and shines as the goody-two-shoes who suddenly finds herself in  prison.  Her's was the best performance in the film.Bill Pullman was  miscast as the lawyer.  His wry and diffident style is an asset in films  like &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot;, but as a lawyer in a third world  country on a crusade to free two innocent girls from injustice, he had the  wrong personality.The tourist's look at Thailand was interesting, but it  didn't make me want to go there.Overall, an entertaining film made  implausible in parts by the insertion of some ridiculous scenes.

For many, her best role to date is still Angela Chase, the precocious, vulnerable and ringingly authentic 90s teen on the series &quot;My So-Called Life.&quot;The movies have been, against all predictions, less kind to the young actress.  She usually manages to turn in a solid performance, but even the prestige pieces, like &quot;Romeo+Juliet&quot; and &quot;Les Miserables&quot; don't really show her off her talents to the best possible effect.  Big productions tend to swallow her up.  For this reason, I have my doubts about the upcoming film version of Michael Cunningham's &quot;The Hours&quot;--where she'll possibly be one more minor luminary in a stellar cast.&quot;Brokedown Palace&quot; is a flawed film, but a reasonably good vehicle for Danes and her co-star, British actress Kate Beckinsale.  As an object lesson in the dangers posed to American youth traveling abroad, this film is pretty effective.  I don't doubt that many young viewers will identify with the two recent high school graduates, who travel on vacation to Bangkok and wind up as pawns in an elaborate drug smuggling scam, facing 35 year prison terms in a filthy Thai jail.  Strong stuff, and the actresses make the best of it.Certainly, in that sense, it's a better than average &quot;teen movie.&quot;  It has substance (abused and otherwise), but it still lacks the pacing and the punch of similarly themed efforts like &quot;Midnight Express.&quot;  See it for two excellent performances by two very gifted young actresses.  But it could have been something much more.  Director Jonathan Kaplan has benefitted before from sterling performances by brilliant young actresses (&quot;The Accused&quot; garnered Jodie Foster her first Oscar), but this one needs more of a kick-start than even Danes and Beckinsale can manage.",3,"Grim, gritty... but not great",1010793600,"01 12, 2002",2002,2042,"['understand', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'number', 'films', 'proverbial', 'can', 'should', 'see', 'light', 'day', '2002', 'who', 'remain', 'forever', 'hopeful', ""'ll"", 'find', 'vehicle', 'worthy', 'talents', 'cause', 'hope', 'many', 'best', 'role', 'date', 'still', 'Angela', 'Chase', 'precocious', 'vulnerable', 'ringingly', 'authentic', '90s', 'teen', 'series', 'quot', 'So-Called', 'Life.', 'quot', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'predictions', 'less', 'kind', 'young', 'actress', 'usually', 'turn', 'solid', 'performance', 'even', 'prestige', 'pieces', 'quot', 'Romeo+Juliet', 'quot', 'quot', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'show', 'off', 'talents', 'best', 'possible', 'effect', 'Big', 'productions', 'tend', 'swallow', 'up', 'reason', 'have', 'doubts', 'upcoming', 'film', 'version', 'Michael', 'Cunningham', 'quot', 'Hours', 'quot', 'where', ""'ll"", 'possibly', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'minor', 'luminary', 'stellar', 'cast.', 'quot', 'Brokedown', 'Palace', 'quot', 'flawed', 'film', 'reasonably', 'good', 'vehicle', 'Danes', 'co-star', 'British', 'actress', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'object', 'lesson', 'dangers', 'posed', 'American', 'youth', 'traveling', 'abroad', 'film', 'pretty', 'effective', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'many', 'young', 'viewers', 'will', 'identify', 'two', 'recent', 'high', 'school', 'graduates', 'who', 'travel', 'vacation', 'Bangkok', 'wind', 'up', 'as', 'pawns', 'elaborate', 'drug', 'smuggling', 'scam', 'facing', '35', 'year', 'prison', 'terms', 'filthy', 'Thai', 'jail', 'Strong', 'stuff', 'actresses', 'make', 'best', 'it.Certainly', 'sense', 'better', 'average', 'quot', 'movie.', 'quot', 'substance', 'abused', 'otherwise', 'still', 'pacing', 'punch', 'similarly', 'themed', 'efforts', 'quot', 'Midnight', 'Express.', 'quot', 'See', 'two', 'excellent', 'performances', 'two', 'very', 'gifted', 'young', 'actresses', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'Director', 'Jonathan', 'Kaplan', 'benefitted', 'sterling', 'performances', 'brilliant', 'young', 'actresses', 'quot', 'Accused', 'quot', 'garnered', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'first', 'Oscar', 'one', 'more', 'kick-start', 'even', 'Danes', 'Beckinsale', 'can', 'manage']",Brokedown Palace

It is compelling, interesting, great acting (GREAT acting), great storytelling, and catches you up in how you would do in similar horrible circumstances.  Two young girls on an adventure in Hawaii get the chance to visit Thailand.  They decide to do it without telling their parents.  They have been best friends forever, Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale), and meet a guy in Thailand who spends money lavishly on them.  When he suggests a weekend in Hong Kong, they go along...only to be violently stopped by Thai police at the airport and tossed into jail after they find 3 kilos of heroin in the girl's backpack (planted by the young man unbeknownst to the girls).  They are given a short, disastrous trial and given 40 years in prison.  There is nothing glamorous about Thai prison.  Their one hope is Yankee Hank Green (Bill Pullman), an American attorney who practices Thai law (one of his best performances to date).  The challenges they face attempting to gain their freedom via Hank and the challenges in prison, plus their barely contained fear of staying their forever, are perfectly balanced in a perfectly paced story.

And I do agree at times the prison seemed so sunny, too friendly, too cheerful, etc to be realistic.  But I think that the plot is that of a tale of friendship as much as it is of serving time in a Thai prison.Most importantly, I think that anyone who is a first time traveler or planning on backpacking throughout Southeast Asia really should see this film.  Darlene and Alice were typical girls from USA Suburbia.  They had just finished school (like many who are about to do a gap year or some backpacking) and went to Thailand because it was exotic, different, faraway... They really didn't know much about Thai culture before they set out.Sadly, they stayed in Thailand for much longer than they had planned to -- locked up in a women's prision (probably Lard Yao), for carrying drugs.  Without devulging the plot, it is fair to say that they were innocent.Again, another harsh reminder that if you are heading to Southeast Asia (or really any developing area), you need to be really careful.  Watch this, read Sandra Gregory's &quot;Forget you Had a Daughter,&quot; and don't try anything stupid (or don't be coerced, tricked, etc).

She is so eye-fetching and compelling as an actress, that you just want to reach out and touch her.  But, what a lousy ending.  It had potential.  The scenario is an all too familiar one,  two good-looking American girls find themselves trapped in an Asian prison with seemingly no way out. But, this isn't a jailbait movie, it attempts to address the issue in a serious way, a la Midnight Express, but unfortunately falls flat on its face.The characters are so unbelievable (except Danes of course).  Fathers who allow their daughters to rot in jail.  A private American lawyer hanging out in Bangkok who wiffs of second-hand Graham Greene novels ready to bail out the girls for a price. A friendship between the two girls that you really have to question in the face of what happens to them, and an ending that will leave you totally exasperated.I don't suppose this was based on a true story.  Rather, the director seemed in search of some gravitas and needed to concoct an ending that would carry with it the emotional weight he imagined would be the case in such a situation.

I can think of several titles more appropriate then &quot;Brokedown Palace.&quot;  &quot;Thailand 90210,&quot; how about &quot;The real  World....Bangkock.&quot; God I feel silly.  I was actually afraid of this  film.  I had horrible images in my mind of poor Claire Danes and poor Kate  Beckenshaw (whoever the hell she is), being tossed into some &quot;Midnight  Express&quot; style hell hole, I hate movies like that, but not Claire  Danes, oh please not that!  I needn't have worried. It turns out that  foreign prisons are not so much jails as crowded dorm rooms in junior  college, this move could have taken place in any Catholic boarding school.  I wanted to love it or hate it but, like many, many critics, just couldn't  muster much concern one way or another.  Sure the film is rife with silly  errors Example: there is no mention of passports, these girls just fly off  to Thailand either without them (they would not have gotten plain tickets)  or they paid an exorbitant price for them (negating any money saving that  would have enticed them to go in the first place).  Certain jobs in  Thailand are not held by foreigners, it is not allowed.  One of those jobs  is in the legal field, unless you are Bill Pullman, I guess there is a  special exception for him, anyway. These errors are not so glaring as the  whole concept of two wild party girls, the film opens with them drinking in  a graveyard with there friends, rushing halfway around the world to pray at  a temple, oh those crazy girls, &quot;It's graduation.....lets go to the  Buddhist temple as start praying'&quot; Who could blame them. Then there is  the whole smuggling thing.  Do you believe that smugglers deliberately turn  in there own &quot;mules&quot; so others can get by, do you think that the  Thai airport authorities would not see that 8 girls heading to Hong Kong  had the tickets purchased on the same stolen credit card?  There is much to  swallow hear, and precious little reason to.  The big emotional scene in  the film is when Darlene accused Alice of sleeping with Nick, I am not  kidding, this is where she really cuts loose, not when she is arrested or  is freed by Alice's whining in court.  There is an unbearable scene in the  end where Claire Danes literally throws herself on the mercy lf the Thai  court...oh the humanity!  And a plethora of silliness in the prison, after  an attempted escape, she and her girlfriend are thrown in the quite room to  pout, oh those evil Thai and there torture!  The pouty room!  Surly  Amnesty International should be notified, and who dies there makeup in  prison anyway? they do a good job.  I wish I could just say this was, balls  out, a terrible movie, but Claire is such a sweetie that I, like the prison  officials, just can't stay mad at the poor girl.  I hope, I really hope  that our prisoners are being treated as nicely as they are in this movie,  sadly that probably is not true.  I will be visiting Thailand in March and  will let anyone know how it went, will go see our prisoners there.

473991,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6305714886,Lawyeraau,"[3, 6]","This is the story of two girls, Alice Marano (Claire Danes) and Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale), who are best friends. Alice is from a blue collar background, while Darlene's family is white collar. They have just graduated from high school and are supposed to be going on a trip to Hawaii to celebrate, except that Alice convinces Darlene that they should, instead, go a more exotic locattion. So, while telling their parents they are off to Hawaii, they end up going to Thailand, where they flop in a six dollar a night fleabag hotel, replete with roaches the size of potatoes.They hook up with a handsome, young Australian named Nick Parks (Daniel Lapaine), who engages their confidence and with whom they briefly end up hanging out. Alice and Darlene find themselves competing for his interest. He then invites them to accompany him for a weekend in Hong Kong and, ultimately, both agree. While at the airport to board their flight to Hong Kong, they suddenly discover themselves under arrest, as one of their backpacks is found to contain a large cache of drugs, much to their collective surprise.The girls then begin a journey through the Tibetan criminal justice system, which appears to be a corrupt one and especially harsh on the drug trafficking of which they are accused. Alice, the more savvy one, declines to sign anything, while Darlene, the more naive of the two, signs a statement written in Thai that she believes to be a transcript of her own words, only later to find that she has signed a complete confession. Even after obtaining legal representation from an expatriate attorney named Yankee Hank Green (Bill Pullman), they still end up being sentenced to a very long prison term. This is where the movie really starts focusing on what it is really all about, their friendship.Excellent performances are given by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale, as well as Bill Pullman. While Claire Danes give her somewhat hard edged character a certain vulnerability, somehow the viewer knows that she could probably do the time to which she is sentenced while standing on her head. Kate Beckinsale imbues her her character with a fragility that lets the viewer know that if she stays in that Tibeetan prison for very long, she will be a goner.While the ending comes as somewhat of a surprise, it is somehow fitting.

There is truth, perhaps, to both the criticism and the compliments that have been bandied about by this film. One thing that is clear to me is that looking more deeply into the film's subtext would probably change a lot of minds.True, some of the auxiliary characters are cliche' and underdeveloped.  But in fairness, that's why they are ""auxiliary.""True, not all of the sets and camera work were Academy Award character.  But once again, in fairness, the imagery of the film and the beautiful use of light and color makes some of those faults less apparent.True, it is a horrible story about what ""happened"" to them.  Yet once again echoing other reviewers, this story is not really about the horror of the prison experience in and of itself.What holds this movie together is the acting of Danes and the complexity of her character.  What did happen between her and Nick Barnes?  We never really know.  What we see is a conflicted person who wants desperately to be believed while everyone, including her own father, sees her as the ""trouble-maker"" and assumes her guilt.The relationship she develops with Bill Pullman's character brings out this complexity.  He is the only one to shower the kindness of presumed innocence on her, and perhaps that is what prompts her to take the fall for her friend.The question is, do you really think she was taking the fall or did she know more than she says?  Or was it Darlene playing the innocent victim?  We are left to wonder and to replay the scenes of them on their way to the airport attempting to figure out who, if anybody, really was innocent in all of this.Those who like interesting character studies will enjoy this performance.

473995,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305714886,Matthew Horner,"[0, 2]","""Brokedown Palace"" is a movie which will probably appeal more to women than to men, as is explores the mysterious world [to men] of female friendship. While it tries hard to be meaningful, it's no ""Thelma and Louise"" in either the dramatic or comedic sense.Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsdale are Alice and Darlene, two girls who have been best friends all their lives. As a present to themselves, they have planned a vacation together to celebrate their high school graduation. Alice, the more outgoing of the pair, convinces Darlene that this should be a trip they will never forget. She decides that Thailand is a country exotic enough to fill the bill. With some trepidation, Darlene, prodded by Alice, persuades her parents to let her go by insisting the pair is going to Hawaii. Once in Thailand, the girls settle in and start having a good time. Before long, however, they are involved in an incident that lands them in jail. Things go from bad to worse as they become trapped in Thailand's convoluted legal system.Danes and Beckinsdale are convincing as two naive Americans who get in way over their heads. They convey the terror and confusion that arises then anyone is charged with a serious crime in a foreign land. As Hank and Yon Greene, Bill Pullman and Jaqui Kim are adequate in their fairly small roles as the girls' attorneys.There is a lot of high drama in ""Brokedown Palace,"" There are also some fundamental script problems. I can't say much about them without spoiling the plot. Basically, much of the drama is forced, causing an ""I'm so sure"" reaction on the part of the viewer. The girls' parents, for example are even more distant emotionally than they are physically. Their reactions cause Darlene and Alice to get deeper into trouble, but it all seems contrived because the parents' behavior is so odd. Added together, these contrivances cause the movie's dark but noble conclusion to lack the impact it could have had. This is unfortunate, because the film's basic question is an important one. Just how far are you willing to go to save your best friend?The photography is excellent. The Philippines are where the film was shot, but I doubt most of us can tell the difference. There are some splendid songs in ""Brokedown Palace,"" although most of them have precious little to do with the story.",3,"Photography, songs highlight contrived melodrama",1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,2319,"['Brokedown', 'Palace', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'appeal', 'more', 'women', 'men', 'mysterious', 'world', '[', 'men', ']', 'female', 'friendship', 'hard', 'be', 'meaningful', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'dramatic', 'comedic', 'sense.Claire', 'Danes', 'Kate', 'Beckinsdale', 'are', 'Alice', 'Darlene', 'two', 'girls', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'friends', 'lives', 'present', 'have', 'planned', 'vacation', 'together', 'celebrate', 'high', 'school', 'graduation', 'Alice', 'more', 'outgoing', 'pair', 'convinces', 'Darlene', 'should', 'be', 'trip', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'Thailand', 'country', 'exotic', 'enough', 'fill', 'bill', 'trepidation', 'Darlene', 'prodded', 'Alice', 'parents', 'let', 'go', 'insisting', 'pair', 'going', 'Hawaii', 'Once', 'Thailand', 'girls', 'settle', 'start', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'long', 'however', 'are', 'involved', 'incident', 'jail', 'Things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'become', 'trapped', 'Thailand', 'convoluted', 'legal', 'system.Danes', 'Beckinsdale', 'are', 'convincing', 'two', 'naive', 'Americans', 'who', 'get', 'way', 'heads', 'convey', 'terror', 'confusion', 'then', 'anyone', 'charged', 'serious', 'crime', 'foreign', 'land', 'Hank', 'Yon', 'Greene', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'Jaqui', 'Kim', 'are', 'adequate', 'fairly', 'small', 'roles', 'girls', 'lot', 'high', 'drama', 'Brokedown', 'Palace', 'are', 'also', 'fundamental', 'script', 'problems', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'spoiling', 'plot', 'Basically', 'much', 'drama', 'forced', 'causing', ""'m"", 'so', 'sure', 'reaction', 'part', 'viewer', 'girls', 'parents', 'example', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'distant', 'emotionally', 'are', 'physically', 'reactions', 'cause', 'Darlene', 'Alice', 'get', 'deeper', 'trouble', 'contrived', 'parents', 'behavior', 'so', 'odd', 'Added', 'together', 'contrivances', 'cause', 'movie', 'dark', 'noble', 'conclusion', 'lack', 'impact', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'unfortunate', 'film', 'basic', 'question', 'important', 'one', 'Just', 'how', 'far', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'save', 'best', 'friend', 'photography', 'excellent', 'Philippines', 'are', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'doubt', 'most', 'can', 'tell', 'difference', 'are', 'splendid', 'songs', 'Brokedown', 'Palace', 'most', 'have', 'precious', 'little', 'do', 'story']",Brokedown Palace

It is a part of the movie but is meant to be pretty obvious it was the Nick Parks character.  It was more about their suspicions about each other.A lot of the criticism of this film is that the prison is not so terrible and the mystery about who put the drugs in the backpack was not compelling.  OF COURSE NOT, That is not what the movie was about.That is like criticizing that ""Scarface"" wasn't a great tale of adventures at sea because he came over on a boat.This movie is about 2 friends.  One is considered the troublemaker who carelessly causes problems for the other.  The other is considered more stable.They find themselves in a hopeless situation.  (Not one where they are beaten and tortured, which would have not been good for the movie!) In the end, the friend who is considered the selfish troublemaker turns out to be the one who makes a very intense self-less sacrifice for the benefit of the other.That is what the movie is about.  If you don't judge it on that, then you are not judging it on what it is intended to be.This is a great movie.  Almost all the characters were exceptionally acted.  Characters were not given more attention than due and all scenes added a lot of emotion to the situations.The 2 fathers were fabulously acted.  One who sits by idlely feeling he has no power.  The other travels to Thailand and gives a great performance laying a guilt trip on his daughter's friend accusing her of the situation.Bill Pullman (who I don't usually consider a good actor) surprisingly perfectly portrays their lawyer who is more selfishly concerned with his payment and going on to something else when he doubts their story.  But becomes more concerned with them when he uncovers more information believing they are innocent.  This character realistically had a lot of dimension whose behavior shifts based on the facts of situation.He has a great chemistry with his wife who is more stable and diligent in uncovering the facts.  She is less selfish and concerned with their payment.  When Hank Green (Bill Pullman's lawyer character) has already made his assessments and gives little attention and technically has abandoned the case, his wife brings more information to him which changes his premature assessment.Nothing is overdramatized.  The drama is built naturally and realistically, which makes this a better film than others.I haven't really covered that much about the film except to counter what I feel are the false criticism's of the film.

474000,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305714886,Reviewer,"[1, 2]","Upon graduation from High School, two lifelong friends take it upon themselves to alter their post-graduation travel plans, changing the destination of their celebration trip from Hawaii to the more exotic (they think) Thailand.  And for Alice Marano (Claire Danes) and Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale), it's but the first of many mistakes they will come to regret in ""Brokedown Palace,"" directed by Jonathan Kaplan.  Of the two, Darlene is the more reserved, conservative one, and when Alice first suggests changing Hawaii for Thailand, Darlene demurs; she knows her father would never allow it.  Which leads them to mistake number two:  They make the arrangements themselves, telling no one, not even their parents, that they've changed destinations.  Initially, they are elated by the freedom the leap from sheltered student to independent adult affords them; unfortunately, they lack the experience and frame of reference needed to successfully negotiate the nuances of a country that is so unlike anything they've ever known.They land in Thailand and approach their ""adventure"" with the same casual indifference they would a school field trip, but as they quickly discover, there is no bus waiting to take them home at the end of the day.  Nor are they prepared for the irresistible attention bestowed upon them by the dashing young man they meet-- a traveler as well-- who charms them with some very romantic, and ultimately very dangerous, notions.  They soon learn that being naive in the ways of the real world, and still more innocent than they'd like to admit, can be a lethal combination for two young, unprotected girls in a foreign land.  And in a text book example of learning something the hard way, their epiphany comes too late, and their ""harmless"" decision to change their travel plans ends up changing their lives forever.With this film, Kaplan delivers a good, solid and somewhat emotionally involving drama, but it's hardly anything new, and certainly not ground breaking in any way.  In fact, the same territory was covered, only better, in the `98 film, ""Return To Paradise,"" and especially in 1978's ""Midnight Express,"" the most significant difference being that the protagonists here are young, vulnerable women.  The film is well made and acted, but there are no real surprises on hand, and barely enough tension to sustain interest.  The best thing about this movie is the performances by Danes and Beckinsale, both of whom manage to make their respective characters believable.There is one aspect of the film that challenges credibility somewhat (and it is only slightly), and that is the fact that these two girls are supposedly lifelong, best friends.  Though they relate well enough to one another, there's a decided lack of evidence that would indicate that kind of closeness between them, especially when compared to the similar kind of relationship depicted in the film ""Heavenly Creatures,"" in which the closeness of the young ladies in question is never in doubt.  The problem, however, is more of a reflection upon the screenplay and the director, than it is on the actors.The supporting cast includes Bill Pullman (Yankee Hank), Jacqueline Kim (Yon), Lou Diamond Phillips (Roy), Daniel Lapaine (Nick), Tom Amandes (Doug Davis), Aimee Graham (Beth Ann) and John Doe (Bill Marano).  There's a message in ""Brokedown Place"" that Kaplan holds up like a warning sign for the young, inexperienced adventurer that reads, ""Proceed With Caution!""  But words of wisdom are often impotent and are bound to fall on deaf ears when directed at those engaged in the transition between youth and adulthood, and like Alice and Darlene, there are many who will always insist on taking the hard road to enlightenment.

474002,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,6305714886,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 2]","High on the list of sadly neglected and wholly underappreciated films of the past several years stands 1998's &quot;Return to Paradise,&quot; a tale of three American vacationers who inadvertantly run afoul of the laws of  Malaysia, two of whom must decide whether or not to sacrifice themselves  and return to the brutal third world country to serve their prison sentence  so that the third who has been caught can avoid execution. What is most  remarkable about this film is that it manages not only to set up a  fascinating moral dilemma for both the characters and the audience but,  most amazingly, to stay true and honest to it throughout the course of the  entire film.&quot;Brokedown Palace,&quot; whose plot echoes &quot;Return  to Paradise,&quot; falls several notches below the earlier film mostly  because it saves its moral dilemma until the very end of the story. The  resolution is a powerful one when it comes, but the delay robs the film as  a whole of some of its interest. In this film, Claire Danes and Kate  Beckinsdale play recent high school graduates who opt to visit Thailand  instead of Hawaii and run into a sleazy young con man who plants heroin on  them - an act for which, when it is discovered by the authorities, the  girls are falsely imprisoned. The bulk of the film concerns itself with the  attempts by an American lawyer (Bill Pullman) to clear their names and  secure their freedom.Much of the film plays like a rehash of  &quot;Midnight Express,&quot; as the girls are badgered and threatened  through their interrogations and forced to endure the rigors of a Third  World prison - although, strangely enough, the horrors seem oddly  downplayed at times. These are the weakest sections of the film for the  visualization of the experience seems almost too glamorized at times, as if  the commercial-minded filmmakers didn't dare risk alienating these  actresses' many fans by offending their sensibilities. Still, the situation  is a ripe one for intense audience identification since who cannot  empathize with a couple of fun loving adolescents caught in a nightmarish  web not of their own making? Actually, the sharpest aspect of the film is  the underlying theme of the scary part seemingly insignificant actions and  decisions can play in determining the course of one's entire life.  Constantly, the girls are forced to wonder &quot;what if we had gone to  Hawaii...what if we had not met the drug smuggler...what if we had not  snuck into the hotel to order drinks on a stranger's room bill, etc.&quot;  The movie also achieves some depth in its final moments as Alice (Danes)  grapples with a major moral decision and discovers the redemption for a  life built on a pattern of seemingly insignificant deceit and lies. She  realizes that a person's character is made up of ALL the actions she  performs in a lifetime, regardless of how trivial or benign they may seem  at the time. In addition, she learns the often horrifying price true  friendship sometimes demands - and her final actions betoken a personal  maturation that helps lift her character far above the rung of conventional  movie heroines.&quot;Brokedown Palace&quot; may occasionally seem  tedious in its details, but the thematic depth and moral underpinnings that  lie within it make it a film worth watching.",3,flawed but thoughtful film,964310400,"07 23, 2000",2000,3324,"['High', 'list', 'sadly', 'neglected', 'wholly', 'underappreciated', 'films', 'past', 'several', 'years', '1998', 'quot', 'Return', 'Paradise', 'quot', 'tale', 'three', 'American', 'vacationers', 'who', 'inadvertantly', 'run', 'afoul', 'laws', 'Malaysia', 'two', 'whom', 'must', 'decide', 'not', 'sacrifice', 'return', 'brutal', 'third', 'world', 'country', 'serve', 'prison', 'sentence', 'third', 'who', 'been', 'caught', 'can', 'avoid', 'execution', 'What', 'most', 'remarkable', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'set', 'up', 'fascinating', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'characters', 'audience', 'most', 'amazingly', 'stay', 'true', 'honest', 'course', 'entire', 'film.', 'quot', 'Brokedown', 'Palace', 'quot', 'plot', 'quot', 'Return', 'Paradise', 'quot', 'several', 'notches', 'earlier', 'film', 'mostly', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'very', 'end', 'story', 'resolution', 'powerful', 'one', 'when', 'delay', 'film', 'whole', 'interest', 'film', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Kate', 'Beckinsdale', 'play', 'recent', 'high', 'school', 'graduates', 'who', 'opt', 'visit', 'Thailand', 'instead', 'Hawaii', 'run', 'sleazy', 'young', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'plants', 'heroin', 'act', 'when', 'discovered', 'authorities', 'girls', 'are', 'falsely', 'imprisoned', 'bulk', 'film', 'concerns', 'attempts', 'American', 'lawyer', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'clear', 'names', 'secure', 'freedom.Much', 'film', 'plays', 'rehash', 'quot', 'Midnight', 'Express', 'quot', 'girls', 'are', 'badgered', 'threatened', 'interrogations', 'forced', 'endure', 'rigors', 'Third', 'World', 'prison', 'strangely', 'enough', 'horrors', 'seem', 'oddly', 'downplayed', 'times', 'are', 'weakest', 'sections', 'film', 'visualization', 'experience', 'almost', 'too', 'glamorized', 'times', 'commercial-minded', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'dare', 'risk', 'alienating', 'actresses', 'many', 'fans', 'offending', 'sensibilities', 'Still', 'situation', 'ripe', 'one', 'intense', 'audience', 'identification', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'empathize', 'couple', 'fun', 'loving', 'adolescents', 'caught', 'nightmarish', 'web', 'not', 'own', 'making', 'Actually', 'sharpest', 'aspect', 'film', 'underlying', 'theme', 'scary', 'part', 'seemingly', 'insignificant', 'actions', 'decisions', 'can', 'play', 'determining', 'course', 'one', 'entire', 'life', 'Constantly', 'girls', 'are', 'forced', 'wonder', 'quot', 'what', 'had', 'gone', 'Hawaii', 'what', 'had', 'not', 'met', 'drug', 'smuggler', 'what', 'had', 'not', 'snuck', 'hotel', 'order', 'drinks', 'stranger', 'room', 'bill', 'etc.', 'quot', 'movie', 'also', 'depth', 'final', 'moments', 'Alice', 'Danes', 'major', 'moral', 'decision', 'redemption', 'life', 'built', 'pattern', 'seemingly', 'insignificant', 'deceit', 'lies', 'person', 'character', 'made', 'ALL', 'actions', 'lifetime', 'regardless', 'how', 'trivial', 'benign', 'may', 'seem', 'time', 'addition', 'often', 'horrifying', 'price', 'true', 'friendship', 'sometimes', 'final', 'actions', 'betoken', 'personal', 'maturation', 'lift', 'character', 'far', 'rung', 'conventional', 'movie', 'heroines.', 'quot', 'Brokedown', 'Palace', 'quot', 'may', 'occasionally', 'seem', 'tedious', 'details', 'thematic', 'depth', 'moral', 'underpinnings', 'lie', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'watching']",Brokedown Palace

In the absence of such a performance, I don't think the ending would have worked so well.  I've seen other movies she's done, and I don't think she's ever been better.

But not like this one.  Alice Marano (Claire Danes) and Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale) are sent to rot in a Thai prison for a crime they didn't even know they commited.  What makes the Thai prison so harsh is the fact that it's outside, it's hot, and you don't really get visitation rights.When Alice and Darlene finish high-school, they tell their parents they're going to Hawaii, when really it's Thailand they're headed for.  All's well for the beginning of the trip, and they even manage to make a new friend, Nick Parks (played by Daniel Lapaine), after he covers a tab they tried to get out of paying for at a hotel.  And, being the handsome Australian he is, is able to woo both of the girls into going to Hong-Kong with him.  But what happens at the airport before going to Hong-Kong is quite the shocker.  Airport security finds drugs on one of their backpacks and takes them away.  Being that this is Thailand, and not America (where we'd probably let this slide the first time), the two are sent to 33 years in the aforementioned prison.  I don't want to give away anything else, but as you can imagine neither are very happy with this sentence; as they do everything they can to be released.Underrated director Jonathan Kaplan does a lot with a movie I think most people overlook.  He's also able to bring in big-name actor Bill Pullman, who plays Alice and Darlene's lawyer.  The movie is very good, yet the story is similar to the Vince Vaughn movie ""Return To Paradise"".  And if you liked that one I'm sure you'll like this movie.  I gave it 3 stars for two reasons: one, the plot is very similar to that 1998 movie, which was made only a year before ""Brokedown Palace"".  And two, because the ending seemed to be a bit melodramatic, even if it seems to be fitting.

This movie was recommended to me, and I was disappointed. It lost credibility with scenes like the padded  bra with money getting past security. That just wouldn't happen. Also, we  are left to wonder if the blonde girl did in fact know about the drugs in  her pack pack. If you recall she remained in the accommodation room for a  while longer while her friend was at the checkout paying the tab. Now the  silly part was the ending. It was as if the producers decided that the film  had to finish up, so let's get a conclusion quickly. There is no way that  the king would have allowed the blonde girl to run to the front and beg for  her friend's forgiveness. Yes, I realise the film was trying to capture a  strained friendship, but simply put, the Thai law wouldn't free one go over  the other. People go to these prisons and that's it. My point being that  this film could have been so much more if it stuck to a more realistic  storyline. I suggest readers get hold of 'Bangkok Hilton' starring Nicole  Kidman. It was made in 1989.
