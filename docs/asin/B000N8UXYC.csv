1054756,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000N8UXYC,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[108, 115]","If I could scream from the top of the tallest Virginia mountain and have others hear me, I would.  I would scream my heart out if only those sitting in New York comfy chairs would acknowledge the fact that the BBC continually, at times without effort, creates amazing television series with what seems like the least amount of effort.  With the new shows coming out on American television lately we either need to have big budgets coupled with big explosions or special effects, big names to topple the ratings, or convoluted plots that keep us guessing till the very ending and still give us nothing - alas, the BBC continues to prove that theory wrong.  Using a small set, justified plots, and big names - but combined efforts, the group from across the pond continues to impress me.  This time, it was with a small, probably unheard dramedy, entitled, ""Clatterford"".Inspired by the same minds that brought us ""Ab Fab"" and the team of French and Saunders tone it down a bit and bring the country into your own living room.  With a subdued beginning episode that may bring a tear to your eye, it also brings us closer to this small town residence - half ""Vicar of Dibly"" half ""Northern Exposure"" and part ""Gilmore Girls"" lifestyle.  What drew me into this show were the individual stories, the powerfully exemplified characters, and the simplicity of each episode.  You don't go into ""Clatterford"" expecting Jack Bauer to pop out behind these ladies, which is a whole new level of watching television.  ""Clatterford"" uses lackluster technology, beautiful scenery, and female swagger to tell a story that can be relatable to anyone, even if you live in a big city surrounding.  I should mention, that isn't a show for your average male.  Not that I am being negative about this, but the female to male ratio in this program is low - this isn't ""24"" hours in the life of a village, this is reaction vs. consequences coupled by togetherness.  Sounding odd?  These shouldn't seem like random encounters.  This is about a village sustaining what we, as Americans, have forgotten about - our own people.  The village in ""Clatterford"", albeit focused quite a bit on the local church organization, but surprisingly worked together.  There is one episode dedicated to showing how this little gathering supports the little village.  These women may not encounter each other if it weren't for this little group - and it is the gatherings and events that bring us, the audience, as well as these pivotal ladies together.Oh, and did I mention this show was not just sincere - but also very, very funny.  While I had trouble laughing at Dawn French's character of Rosie (because she is mentally unstable), she provided a small slice of enjoyment as the rest of the cast equally contributed.  Of course, there is one stand out - which is the the central focus of some episodes, but it isn't overbearing.  When I finished the series, I cared about each of the characters individually, which is hard to do with most modern American television series.  Not to be negative about our television, but ""Clatterford"" far exceeds much of what I have seen here in the states.  It is subtle, not everyone will get the intelligent humor, and it is rich in character development - bringing together an entire village to capture our hearts.Overall, I would have trouble suggesting this television series to everyone, because it can get depressing, it can get involved, and it can get emotional (sans the explosions), all without the help of beefy men.  Sounds impossible doesn't it?  I know most will not get the humor of this program, but for me ""Clatterford"" was a simple show, complex emotion, and well-rounded individuals that bring humanity to a new level.  I loved it.  I could watch this short series again (especially the episode with the Christmas Pantomime).  I will support this show, alas, I just don't think it will see the audience that it needs to in America.Sign me up for two whole cases of these ladies' jam.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,I wish I could move to Clatterford...,1181347200,"06 9, 2007",2007,4023,"['could', 'scream', 'top', 'tallest', 'Virginia', 'mountain', 'have', 'others', 'hear', 'would', 'would', 'scream', 'heart', 'only', 'sitting', 'New', 'York', 'comfy', 'chairs', 'would', 'acknowledge', 'fact', 'BBC', 'continually', 'times', 'effort', 'amazing', 'television', 'series', 'what', 'least', 'amount', 'effort', 'new', 'shows', 'coming', 'out', 'American', 'television', 'lately', 'either', 'need', 'have', 'big', 'budgets', 'coupled', 'big', 'explosions', 'special', 'effects', 'big', 'names', 'topple', 'ratings', 'convoluted', 'plots', 'keep', 'guessing', 'till', 'very', 'ending', 'still', 'give', 'nothing', 'alas', 'BBC', 'prove', 'theory', 'wrong', 'Using', 'small', 'set', 'justified', 'plots', 'big', 'names', 'combined', 'efforts', 'group', 'pond', 'impress', 'time', 'was', 'small', 'probably', 'unheard', 'dramedy', 'entitled', 'Clatterford', '.Inspired', 'same', 'minds', 'brought', 'Ab', 'Fab', 'team', 'French', 'Saunders', 'tone', 'down', 'bit', 'bring', 'country', 'own', 'living', 'room', 'subdued', 'beginning', 'episode', 'may', 'bring', 'tear', 'eye', 'also', 'closer', 'small', 'town', 'residence', 'half', 'Vicar', 'Dibly', 'half', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'part', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'lifestyle', 'What', 'drew', 'show', 'were', 'individual', 'stories', 'powerfully', 'exemplified', 'characters', 'simplicity', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'Clatterford', 'expecting', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'pop', 'out', 'ladies', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'watching', 'television', 'Clatterford', 'lackluster', 'technology', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'female', 'swagger', 'tell', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'relatable', 'anyone', 'even', 'live', 'big', 'city', 'surrounding', 'should', 'mention', ""n't"", 'show', 'average', 'male', 'Not', 'am', 'being', 'negative', 'female', 'male', 'ratio', 'program', 'low', ""n't"", '24', 'hours', 'life', 'village', 'reaction', 'vs.', 'consequences', 'coupled', 'togetherness', 'Sounding', 'odd', 'should', ""n't"", 'seem', 'random', 'encounters', 'village', 'sustaining', 'what', 'Americans', 'have', 'forgotten', 'own', 'people', 'village', 'Clatterford', 'focused', 'quite', 'bit', 'local', 'church', 'organization', 'surprisingly', 'worked', 'together', 'one', 'episode', 'dedicated', 'showing', 'how', 'little', 'gathering', 'little', 'village', 'women', 'may', 'not', 'encounter', 'other', 'were', ""n't"", 'little', 'group', 'gatherings', 'events', 'bring', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'pivotal', 'ladies', 'together.Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'sincere', 'also', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'had', 'trouble', 'laughing', 'Dawn', 'French', 'character', 'Rosie', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'provided', 'small', 'slice', 'enjoyment', 'rest', 'cast', 'equally', 'contributed', 'course', 'one', 'stand', 'central', 'focus', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'overbearing', 'When', 'finished', 'series', 'cared', 'characters', 'individually', 'hard', 'do', 'most', 'modern', 'American', 'television', 'series', 'Not', 'be', 'negative', 'television', 'Clatterford', 'far', 'much', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'here', 'states', 'subtle', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'get', 'intelligent', 'humor', 'rich', 'character', 'development', 'bringing', 'together', 'entire', 'village', 'capture', 'hearts.Overall', 'would', 'have', 'trouble', 'suggesting', 'television', 'series', 'everyone', 'can', 'get', 'depressing', 'can', 'get', 'involved', 'can', 'get', 'emotional', 'explosions', 'help', 'beefy', 'men', 'impossible', ""n't"", 'know', 'most', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'humor', 'program', 'Clatterford', 'was', 'simple', 'show', 'complex', 'emotion', 'well-rounded', 'individuals', 'bring', 'humanity', 'new', 'level', 'loved', 'could', 'watch', 'short', 'series', 'again', 'especially', 'episode', 'Christmas', 'Pantomime', 'will', 'support', 'show', 'alas', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'see', 'audience', 'America.Sign', 'up', 'two', 'whole', 'cases', 'ladies', 'jam.Grade', '*****', '*****']",Clatterford: Season 1

I love the outrageous gutterpunk mayhem of The Young Ones. And yet, I also love the subtle complexity of Jam & Jerusalem (aka; Clatterford). It makes me very happy that Jennifer Saunders did not accept the easier road of juvenile humor for her entire career, but rather stuck her neck out with this mature series. IMHO these are some of the most multi-faceted female characters ever broadcast on television. I honestly feel sorry those who can't seem to find the humor here. Dawn French plays one of her most outlandish characters ever, and yet there is an underlying humanity that is quite poignant. The receptionist Tip, is like one of those people you know in real life who's the kind of fallible smart-ass that always brightens your day and keeps your reality checked at the same time. Saunders herself is not the star of this show, but her upper class character often delivers malaprop zingers by confusing sexual fetish terminology with everyday activities. Joanna Lumley admirably goes the farthest afield by digging down and portraying someone 30 years her senior in an unflattering, but entirely honest light. This is not a JOKE show.

I'm adding his opinion, as some might call this series a ""chick flick series"" but we wouldn't agree with that. It's a series that an intelligent, thoughtful adult will like - and there are plenty of men who qualify for that designation.I don't know how to keep my superlatives under control - the writing is amazing for a start. Jennifer Saunders has outdone herself - she's managed to take on some serious subjects under the guise of humor, and she pulls it off spectacularly. These stories simply must be the result of intelligent observation of fellow human beings - warts and kindnesses, follies and wisdom - written by someone who knows how to write. Then these brilliant scripts are given to actors who can, follow me now, actually act! They create well rounded, fully realized human beings. We are with them all the way. We like them! We empathize with them. Most of us have known people like them, and if not, would very much like to do so. And we appreciate that they care for each other, and despite eccentricities, support each other through the tough times of life. In a believable way, mind you. The people are congruent all the way through and the scripts tell stories that flow naturally and easily from the characters. No problem handing over that ""suspension of disbelief"" in this case.I can't leave out the amazing Joanna Lumley - honestly, I laughed every time she came on the screen. And there is a scene between James and his former headmistress involving a pap smear that is maybe the funniest thing ever performed on television. I can't even think about it without breaking into chuckles. The script is beyond wonderful and the actors do it justice with every word and facial expression. Thank you so much - the world doesn't always allow for a good belly laugh, and if I could, I'd anoint you with every award possible for this scene alone. And it isn't alone!I can't recommend this DVD enough. I have told myriad friends and relatives and done everything I can to get it out and about and seen in the states. By the way, do you know how many times I've used the words ""intelligent"" and ""television"" in the same sentence? Maybe 5 times ever?! Okay, maybe 6 times, but that may be pushing it. See this series. Treat yourself.
