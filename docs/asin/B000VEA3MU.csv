1101167,ANOOQD9XOQWSM,B000VEA3MU,"Boxodreams ""boxodreams@aol.com""","[10, 11]","Perhaps the most striking, or is it subtly impactful, things about Killer of Sheep are the children; children that climb and fight and laugh and sing and kick and crawl out from under things, and leave bikes behind as if property meant nothing when they're brought up in a world where nothing is not only a given, but practically a birthright. These are kids that are like kids, not hollywood creations, beautifully represented with the logic of children. the film opens with a stern reprimand to take some responsibility by a father to a boy of about 13, and as soon as that wake-up call is administered, it is punctuated with a slap in the face by the mother, and from that moment on the film is plunged into a lethargy so profound that you can feel the stifling heat of a neighborhood that's got nothing but scraps to kick around. Killer of Sheep is a masterpiece of American black poverty, accompanied by a rich and mournful soundtrack, from the bent-but-not broken dignity of Paul Robeson, to the deep blue sensuality of dinah washington, to the sweet voices of 70s soul, to 1950's roadhouse blues. Here, in stark black and white, are a people that barely dare to speak of the middle class, whose motion takes them sideways, sometimes downward, but forward in only the smallest of increments. And even those steps are dashed by what at first glance would be the fates, but, in reality, is the state of the conditions -- the car ride without a spare tire, the unsecured engine falling out of the bed of a pickup. The juxtaposition of the poor blacks and the sheep going to slaughter should be heavy-handed, but miraculously is, instead, a sad poetry. And even more miraculous are the myriad tiny beauties, the smallest touches the director Burnett illuminates again and again: the warm coffee mug rubbed against a man's cheek and compared to the body of a woman, the little girl in a rubber mask, another young girl singing along with the radio to a doll, a son hiding from his mother on the roof of the house . . . The sheep at the slaughterhouse where the father works are herded and their fear is palpable. They intuit their fate, yet where can they run when boxed in a pen? The adults are of two kinds in the film: those seeking small pleasures, and those too tired or beat up to do anything but sit. It's not a slaughterhouse, but there is no escape. Still, in the end, there are those children, and they flow like fresh water in a fetid pond. Their exuberence is nearly chaos in a void of structure and purpose. Yet when three women gather in the final images of the film to share the joy of one's new pregnancy, you can't help but feel lifted by the promise of hope children somehow always bring into the well of human despair.",5,hustle and flow,1200009600,"01 11, 2008",2008,2738,"['Perhaps', 'most', 'striking', 'subtly', 'impactful', 'things', 'Killer', 'Sheep', 'are', 'children', 'children', 'climb', 'fight', 'laugh', 'sing', 'kick', 'crawl', 'out', 'things', 'leave', 'bikes', 'property', 'meant', 'nothing', 'when', ""'re"", 'brought', 'up', 'world', 'where', 'nothing', 'not', 'only', 'given', 'practically', 'birthright', 'are', 'kids', 'are', 'kids', 'not', 'hollywood', 'creations', 'beautifully', 'represented', 'logic', 'children', 'film', 'stern', 'reprimand', 'take', 'responsibility', 'father', 'boy', '13', 'as', 'soon', 'wake-up', 'call', 'administered', 'punctuated', 'slap', 'face', 'mother', 'moment', 'film', 'plunged', 'lethargy', 'so', 'can', 'feel', 'stifling', 'heat', 'neighborhood', 'got', 'nothing', 'scraps', 'kick', 'around', 'Killer', 'Sheep', 'masterpiece', 'American', 'black', 'poverty', 'accompanied', 'rich', 'mournful', 'soundtrack', 'bent-but-not', 'broken', 'dignity', 'Paul', 'Robeson', 'deep', 'blue', 'sensuality', 'dinah', 'washington', 'sweet', 'voices', '70s', 'soul', '1950', 'roadhouse', 'blues', 'Here', 'stark', 'black', 'white', 'are', 'people', 'barely', 'dare', 'speak', 'middle', 'class', 'motion', 'sideways', 'sometimes', 'downward', 'forward', 'only', 'smallest', 'increments', 'even', 'steps', 'are', 'dashed', 'what', 'first', 'glance', 'would', 'be', 'fates', 'reality', 'state', 'conditions', 'car', 'ride', 'spare', 'tire', 'unsecured', 'engine', 'falling', 'bed', 'pickup', 'juxtaposition', 'poor', 'blacks', 'sheep', 'going', 'slaughter', 'should', 'be', 'heavy-handed', 'miraculously', 'instead', 'sad', 'poetry', 'even', 'more', 'miraculous', 'are', 'myriad', 'tiny', 'beauties', 'smallest', 'director', 'Burnett', 'again', 'again', 'warm', 'coffee', 'mug', 'rubbed', 'man', 'cheek', 'compared', 'body', 'woman', 'little', 'girl', 'rubber', 'mask', 'young', 'girl', 'singing', 'along', 'radio', 'doll', 'son', 'hiding', 'mother', 'roof', 'house', 'sheep', 'slaughterhouse', 'where', 'father', 'works', 'are', 'herded', 'fear', 'palpable', 'intuit', 'fate', 'yet', 'where', 'can', 'run', 'when', 'boxed', 'pen', 'adults', 'are', 'two', 'kinds', 'film', 'seeking', 'small', 'pleasures', 'too', 'tired', 'beat', 'up', 'do', 'anything', 'sit', 'not', 'slaughterhouse', 'escape', 'Still', 'end', 'are', 'children', 'flow', 'fresh', 'water', 'fetid', 'pond', 'exuberence', 'nearly', 'chaos', 'void', 'structure', 'purpose', 'when', 'three', 'women', 'gather', 'final', 'images', 'film', 'share', 'joy', 'one', 'new', 'pregnancy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'lifted', 'promise', 'hope', 'children', 'somehow', 'always', 'bring', 'well', 'human', 'despair']",N/A

It is not a conventional film with a plot, rather it is a slice of the life of a man living in Watts.  There is nothing remarkable in his life, and it delves into the notable tedium and frustrations of his rather regular existence.  A million miles from contemporary Blaxploitation films, or more recent Hood flicks.  The film has innovative cinematography and interesting visuals for one made on a low budget.

Many times you can't tell what's being said, so low is the volume.  And it's not just a question of turning it up, either, since if you do, the next scene will be blastingly loud.  Take for example the scene where those two thugs show up at the principal's doorstep and ask for his help roughing some guy up.  Initially the volume is inaudible; if you turn it up, it soon becomes too loud.  I assume this is because the guys at UCLA were focused on the image and couldn't be bothered to homogenize the audio.As for the film itself, I think it's massively overrated.  Sure, an interesting glimpse into life in a black neighborhood in the 1970's, but the central metaphor -- sheep slaughtering -- was heavy-handed and clumsily explored.",2,"like ""What's Happening!"" but without the jokes",1283904000,"09 8, 2010",2010,936,"['Uh', ""'d"", 'think', 'UCLA', 'saw', 'fit', 'emblazon', 'name', 'packaging', 'being', 'responsible', 'film', 'restoration', ""'d"", 'have', 'done', 'something', 'sound.The', 'sound', 'awful', 'Many', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'so', 'low', 'volume', 'not', 'just', 'question', 'turning', 'up', 'either', 'do', 'next', 'scene', 'will', 'be', 'blastingly', 'loud', 'Take', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'thugs', 'show', 'up', 'principal', 'doorstep', 'ask', 'help', 'roughing', 'guy', 'up', 'Initially', 'volume', 'inaudible', 'turn', 'up', 'soon', 'too', 'loud', 'assume', 'guys', 'UCLA', 'were', 'focused', 'image', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'homogenize', 'audio.As', 'film', 'think', 'massively', 'overrated', 'Sure', 'interesting', 'glimpse', 'life', 'black', 'neighborhood', '1970', 'central', 'metaphor', 'sheep', 'slaughtering', 'was', 'heavy-handed', 'clumsily', 'explored']",N/A
1101170,A1JH5J1KQAUBMP,B000VEA3MU,David Bonesteel,"[1, 1]","Charles Burnett's rediscovered classic is the quiet story of a family in Watts.  Stan (Henry Gayle Sanders) is a good man who has nearly been crushed by poverty.  His soul-killing job at a slaughterhouse doesn't earn enough to lift the family out of poverty, and he is unable to sleep or find joy in life.  Nevertheless, he fulfills his responsibilities the best he can.  His wife (Kaycee Moore) watches what has become of the man she loves with deep concern and love.  Disconnected scenes of their lives and the lives of those around them are intercut with scenes of children at play, inviting us to contemplate their constrained futures.Burnett has a great eye and captures many powerful black and white images.  His non-professional crew of actors is sometimes painfully amateur but it all somehow contributes to the verisimilitude of the project.  Although we do see some law-breaking in this film, Burnett is more interested in telling the stories of decent people with values than gangstas and thugs, and he succeeds in producing a work of gentle, heart-breaking nobility.",4,In the ghetto,1260748800,"12 14, 2009",2009,1078,"['Charles', 'Burnett', 'rediscovered', 'classic', 'quiet', 'story', 'family', 'Watts', 'Stan', 'Henry', 'Gayle', 'Sanders', 'good', 'man', 'who', 'nearly', 'been', 'crushed', 'poverty', 'soul-killing', 'job', 'slaughterhouse', ""n't"", 'earn', 'enough', 'lift', 'family', 'poverty', 'unable', 'sleep', 'find', 'joy', 'life', 'Nevertheless', 'responsibilities', 'best', 'can', 'wife', 'Kaycee', 'Moore', 'what', 'become', 'man', 'deep', 'concern', 'love', 'Disconnected', 'scenes', 'lives', 'lives', 'are', 'intercut', 'scenes', 'children', 'play', 'inviting', 'contemplate', 'constrained', 'futures.Burnett', 'great', 'eye', 'many', 'powerful', 'black', 'white', 'images', 'non-professional', 'crew', 'actors', 'sometimes', 'painfully', 'amateur', 'somehow', 'verisimilitude', 'project', 'do', 'see', 'law-breaking', 'film', 'Burnett', 'more', 'interested', 'telling', 'stories', 'decent', 'people', 'values', 'gangstas', 'thugs', 'producing', 'work', 'gentle', 'heart-breaking', 'nobility']",N/A
