At first I thought it was a theatrical release I had somehow missed- and right away I thought it seemed a bit ""thin."" I looked it up on IMDb and saw it was a TV movie- and it made sense. I merely lowered my ""cinematic"" expectations a bit, and it was fine. Macdonald and Nighy are so appealing they helped me not care, overly, about the rather goofy plot: A gorgeous twenty-something falling madly and sexually in love with a charming but really elderly stranger she met by chance in a cafe. Then after a few days she follows him to Iceland as he plays a minor role on the British delegation to G-8. Then she plays the Innocent who shames the British G-8 delegates to adopt radical human rights proposals, thus paving the way to worldwide social justice. Hmmmm. A little far-fetched! But the ham-fistedly delivered political message of the movie is laudable enough, if a bit vague. Nighy plays a dweeb- and he's so good one would think he actually WAS a dweeb if one hadn't seen him in other roles, such as ""Love Actually"" (coincidentally filmed concurrently with this) and the original British version of ""State of Play."" And Macdonald is, as always a delight to watch, even if in a somewhat awkward and threadbare film.",3,Outstanding cast in a rather contrived movie- but worth watching for Kelly Macdonald fans,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,1324,"['like', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'lot', 'when', 'saw', '2005', 'TV', 'movie', 'DVD', 'snapped', 'up', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'theatrical', 'release', 'had', 'somehow', 'missed-', 'right', 'away', 'thought', 'seemed', 'bit', 'thin', 'looked', 'up', 'IMDb', 'saw', 'was', 'TV', 'movie-', 'made', 'sense', 'merely', 'lowered', 'cinematic', 'expectations', 'bit', 'was', 'fine', 'Macdonald', 'Nighy', 'are', 'so', 'appealing', 'helped', 'not', 'care', 'overly', 'rather', 'goofy', 'plot', 'gorgeous', 'twenty-something', 'falling', 'madly', 'sexually', 'love', 'charming', 'really', 'elderly', 'stranger', 'met', 'chance', 'cafe', 'Then', 'few', 'days', 'Iceland', 'minor', 'role', 'British', 'delegation', 'G-8', 'Then', 'Innocent', 'who', 'British', 'G-8', 'delegates', 'adopt', 'radical', 'human', 'rights', 'proposals', 'thus', 'paving', 'way', 'worldwide', 'social', 'justice', 'Hmmmm', 'little', 'far-fetched', 'ham-fistedly', 'delivered', 'political', 'message', 'movie', 'laudable', 'enough', 'bit', 'vague', 'Nighy', 'dweeb-', 'so', 'good', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'actually', 'WAS', 'dweeb', 'one', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'roles', 'such', 'Love', 'Actually', 'coincidentally', 'filmed', 'concurrently', 'original', 'British', 'version', 'State', 'Play', 'Macdonald', 'always', 'delight', 'watch', 'even', 'somewhat', 'awkward', 'threadbare', 'film']",N/A

1534887,AX2KTTU418MII,B007NE08JO,Jon Corelis,"[1, 1]","The Girl in the Cafe is a combination political drama, about the attempts of the world's governments to end extreme poverty and a May-December love story, with Bill Nighy as a shy and idealistic British government official and Kelly Macdonald as the much younger girl he falls awkwardly in love with.  The love story is well done, with the acting excellent, and since part of the story is set at a government conference in Iceland, we get some spectacular Icelandic scenery included.  The film is worth watching for these elements, and can be especially recommended to those who liked the original British version of the TV series State of Play, since The Girl in the Cafe features the same director (David Yates) and two of the same lead actors (Bill Nighy and Kelly Macdonald.)On the down side, the film has been criticized for a naive and simplistic view of how to address world poverty.  In my opinion, the criticism is largely valid.  The film suffers from what I'd call the Scrooge fantasy:  that if the powerful people at the top would just show a little more humanity, the wretched of the earth would be just fine.  No they wouldn't: economic injustice isn't caused by the inhumanity of the people who are rich, it's caused by the inhumanity of the system that makes and keeps them rich.This review is based on the 2005 standard HBO DVD, which has very good image and sound quality.

1534888,A164D2I3CT3LLF,B007NE08JO,J. Silberman,"[0, 0]","I had seen this film on cable TV several years ago and decided to buy the DVD because I enjoyed the depiction of the relationship between an introverted British bureacrat and an extroverted young  woman, some years his junior, who he meets serrendipitously in a cafe. He's one of those people who labor over every sentence, working it and shaping it in their minds, so it either comes out in tortured fashion, or not at all. The relationship between these two very opposite people is the heart of the film. In a burst of courage, the bureacrat asks the young woman to accompany him on a very important business trip. He must attend the G-8 Summit in Iceland. He is the numbers cruncher for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Once they arrive in Iceland, the film takes a political turn. It turns the young woman into a lecturer, not only to the ministers of the developed world, but to the viewing audience. I am a political conservative and found this leftist lecture sophmoric and not very entertaining. I said I had seen the film several years prior, but I had forgotten how much of it was devoted to the theme of &#34;why can't the developed world divest themselves of a significant portion of their wealth to help the poor?&#34; Although most people on the left, especially those who have no wealth, have no trouble with this question, those of us who consider the flipside of the question, i.e. who's wealth is going to be confiscated, who's going to decide who's wealth is going to be confiscated and how much of their wealth is going to be confiscated? These thorny questions are naturally not raised in the screenplay. They seldom are. But back to the film: politicizing the move to the degree it does not only kills the entertainment value derived from the relationship of the bureacrat and the young woman, it infuriates those who were hoping what had begun as a rather sweet film would not turn into &#34;The Sorrow and the Pity.&#34; I have no objection to the filmmaker using the young woman's politics as a dramatic device, but a satisfying conclusion to this May-November romance is lost and the film ends not in triumph, but with a whimper. What angers me the most is that Bill Nighy and Kelly Macdonald's performances were terrific and the film began so well. Yes the plight of the poor is worth highlighting, but in this case, politics highjacked romance and all but the most politically lefist viewers will be disappointed.",3,"The Relationship Is Compelling, the Politics, Not So Much",1367280000,"04 30, 2013",2013,2441,"['had', 'seen', 'film', 'cable', 'TV', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'decided', 'buy', 'DVD', 'enjoyed', 'depiction', 'relationship', 'introverted', 'British', 'bureacrat', 'extroverted', 'young', 'woman', 'years', 'junior', 'who', 'serrendipitously', 'cafe', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'labor', 'sentence', 'working', 'shaping', 'minds', 'out', 'tortured', 'fashion', 'not', 'relationship', 'two', 'very', 'opposite', 'people', 'heart', 'film', 'burst', 'courage', 'bureacrat', 'young', 'woman', 'accompany', 'very', 'important', 'business', 'trip', 'must', 'attend', 'G-8', 'Summit', 'Iceland', 'numbers', 'cruncher', 'Chancellor', 'Exchequer', 'arrive', 'Iceland', 'film', 'political', 'turn', 'young', 'woman', 'lecturer', 'not', 'only', 'ministers', 'developed', 'world', 'viewing', 'audience', 'am', 'political', 'conservative', 'found', 'leftist', 'lecture', 'sophmoric', 'not', 'very', 'entertaining', 'said', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'several', 'years', 'prior', 'had', 'forgotten', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'devoted', 'theme', '34', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'developed', 'world', 'divest', 'significant', 'portion', 'wealth', 'help', 'poor', '34', 'most', 'people', 'left', 'especially', 'who', 'have', 'wealth', 'have', 'trouble', 'question', 'who', 'consider', 'flipside', 'question', 'i.e', 'who', 'wealth', 'going', 'be', 'confiscated', 'who', 'going', 'decide', 'who', 'wealth', 'going', 'be', 'confiscated', 'how', 'much', 'wealth', 'going', 'be', 'confiscated', 'thorny', 'questions', 'are', 'naturally', 'not', 'raised', 'screenplay', 'seldom', 'are', 'back', 'film', 'politicizing', 'move', 'degree', 'not', 'only', 'entertainment', 'value', 'derived', 'relationship', 'bureacrat', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'were', 'hoping', 'what', 'had', 'begun', 'rather', 'sweet', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'turn', '34', 'Sorrow', 'Pity.', '34', 'have', 'objection', 'filmmaker', 'using', 'young', 'woman', 'politics', 'dramatic', 'device', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'May-November', 'romance', 'lost', 'film', 'not', 'triumph', 'whimper', 'What', 'most', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'performances', 'were', 'terrific', 'film', 'began', 'so', 'well', 'Yes', 'plight', 'poor', 'worth', 'highlighting', 'case', 'politics', 'highjacked', 'romance', 'most', 'politically', 'lefist', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

Though it covers a serious topic, poverty and the G-8.  I am sure that screenwriter Richard Curtis wrote this so that it would be released in time for everone to see it before the G-8 summit. And I hope they saw it. The G-8 summit was the weekend of 2 July 2005.The film is a Romantic Comedy staring Bill Nighy as Lawrence, a financial advisor working for the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the U.K. And co-stars Kelly Macdonald as Gina, the young woman Lawrence meets in the Cafe. This unlikely couple strikes up a relationship of sorts. And Lawrence invites Gina to accompany him to Iceland, where he is attending the G-8 summit. Gina shows a genuine interest in Lawerence's work and she starts to make comments based on what she has learned from him. This ends up jeopardizing Lawrenes job. He has to decide what is more important, what may be his own happines or the career he spent years building.The movie does get its political message out. Which I believe was to point out how important the G-8 summit is. And the power the eight members have to end world poverty. In the end though, I could not give it five stars because the fate of the desperate lives of Third World residents just cannot let you enjoy the story about two awkwardly shy people reaching out for each other. But given the subject matter the acting is superb, as is the direction.
