1623750,A189VV6P4IZJXI,B00BAXTYGW,Anthony McGill,"[0, 0]","Now fully entrenched in the sixty minute format, the second half of season eight gives us another nineteen top-notch episodes with the expected high quality production values we enjoyed with all the previous years.  Once again veteran writers Kathleen Hite and John Meston were responsible for most of the episodes with six each.  One new writing talent to come on board was Paul Savage, a former actor on the radio series, who wrote the final three instalments of the season and who later would be a regular scripter and story consultant on the show. Harry Harris Jr. helmed seven episodes and Andrew V. McLaglen was director of five.Among the bevy of great character actors (one of the great features of ""Gunsmoke"" over the years) featured in this half-season: John Dehner, Will Hutchins, Milton Selzer, Warren Stevens, Richard Jaeckel, Kent Smith, R.G. Armstrong, Sharon Farrell, Beverly Garland, James Best, Ben Johnson, Roy Thinnes  and Edgar Buchanan.""Gunsmoke"" has never lost its universal appeal. Solid writing and directing with great characterizations, shrewd acting choices and the continuing strength of its principal cast now including Burt Reynolds as half-breed Quint Asper, adding a little extra edge to the series.Now for season nine!",5,CONTINUING ON IN GRAND STYLE,1405987200,"07 22, 2014",2014,1251,"['Now', 'fully', 'entrenched', 'sixty', 'minute', 'format', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'eight', 'nineteen', 'top-notch', 'episodes', 'expected', 'high', 'quality', 'production', 'enjoyed', 'previous', 'years', 'Once', 'again', 'veteran', 'writers', 'Kathleen', 'Hite', 'John', 'Meston', 'were', 'responsible', 'most', 'episodes', 'six', 'One', 'new', 'writing', 'talent', 'come', 'board', 'was', 'Paul', 'Savage', 'former', 'actor', 'radio', 'series', 'who', 'wrote', 'final', 'three', 'instalments', 'season', 'who', 'later', 'would', 'be', 'regular', 'scripter', 'story', 'consultant', 'show', 'Harry', 'Harris', 'Jr.', 'helmed', 'seven', 'episodes', 'Andrew', 'V.', 'McLaglen', 'was', 'director', 'five.Among', 'bevy', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'one', 'great', 'features', 'Gunsmoke', 'years', 'featured', 'half-season', 'John', 'Dehner', 'Will', 'Hutchins', 'Milton', 'Selzer', 'Warren', 'Stevens', 'Richard', 'Jaeckel', 'Kent', 'Smith', 'R.G', 'Armstrong', 'Sharon', 'Farrell', 'Beverly', 'Garland', 'James', 'Best', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'Roy', 'Thinnes', 'Edgar', 'Buchanan', 'Gunsmoke', 'never', 'lost', 'universal', 'appeal', 'Solid', 'writing', 'directing', 'great', 'characterizations', 'shrewd', 'acting', 'choices', 'continuing', 'strength', 'principal', 'cast', 'now', 'including', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'half-breed', 'Quint', 'Asper', 'adding', 'little', 'extra', 'edge', 'series.Now', 'season', 'nine']","Gunsmoke: Season 8, Vol. 2"
