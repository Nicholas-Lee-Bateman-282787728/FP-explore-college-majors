The plot has quite a few lapses, the success of some scenes is questionable, the slapstick factor is overused, but ultimately, if you lower your expectations a notch and loosen up, the experience should be pretty hilarious and refreshing. The airport scenes are my favorite ('bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bombitty bomb'), and Ben Stiller is surprisingly good at times.

529944,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXO0,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I am one who fully believes `Meet the Parents' to be one hysterical ride.  From start to finish they get everything right here.  The entire cast works wonderfully together and serves up some of the funniest moments in comedic film to date.  Of all the `go-to' guys in Hollywood for comedy I think that Ben Stiller is probably the most bankable.  Sure, I tend to enjoy Will Ferrell slightly more than Stiller but one can't deny that Stiller equals bank.  Everything he touches (or just about) is box-office gold.  `Meet the Parents' is no exception, but here the funniest member of the cast is not Stiller.  No, De Niro steals the thunder here delivering one of the funniest performances I've seen in recent years.The film follows one zany weekend with the Byrnes family.  Greg is dating Pam Byrnes.  Greg wants to marry Pam but when he hears that Pam's sister Deborah is getting married and that her fianc&eacute; asked her father Jack for permission Greg feels that he must now get permission.  How hard could that be, right?  Wrong.  Jack Byrnes is a very strict and gruff man.  It's obvious that Pam is his golden child and no one will ever be good enough for her.  Pam's mother Dina is the complete opposite, in fact she seems to really like Greg, but in the eyes of Jack Greg is far from good enough for Pam.The film them becomes a domino effect of one landed gag after another as Greg tries to prove himself worthy of Pam's hand.  Yes, each and every joke finds a home.  I was surprised myself at how funny this movie actually was.  The sequel was less successful (I loved it but it does feel like a repeat) but this original is high on the entertainment value.Ben Stiller nails his role as the hapless Greg who just wants to be accepted and marry the girl of his dreams.  Teri Polo is kind of left on the back burner here.  She's mainly there to be the object of affection but since she isn't really given anything to do we become bored with her most of the time.  Don't let that get you down though since she never is allowed to drag down a scene.  Blythe Danner is hysterical as Dina but like I mentioned before, this movie is all about Robert De Niro.  I have always been a huge fan of De Niro but sadly his choice in film has taken a dive recently.  This film probably marks his last `great' performance.  He is on point the entire film and genuinely scene stealing hilarious.  He delivers each and every line with polish and charisma and a believable sincerity that you need to have when you're most frequent word is `Focker'.The end of the film of course brings the family closer together after Jack tries to sabotage everything and learns his lesson.  I think that resolve is why `Meet the Fockers' fails a bit to me since it seems like a complete renig on the finale of this film.  Regardless, `Meet the Parents' should serve as Grade-A entertainment for the family and should result in quite a few belly-laughs.",5,Time to meet one very funny movie...,1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,2927,"['am', 'one', 'who', 'fully', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'be', 'one', 'hysterical', 'ride', 'start', 'finish', 'get', 'everything', 'right', 'here', 'entire', 'cast', 'wonderfully', 'together', 'up', 'funniest', 'moments', 'comedic', 'film', 'date', 'go-to', 'guys', 'Hollywood', 'comedy', 'think', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'probably', 'most', 'bankable', 'Sure', 'tend', 'enjoy', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'slightly', 'more', 'Stiller', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'Stiller', 'equals', 'bank', 'Everything', 'just', 'box-office', 'gold', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'exception', 'here', 'funniest', 'member', 'cast', 'not', 'Stiller', 'No', 'De', 'Niro', 'thunder', 'here', 'delivering', 'one', 'funniest', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'years.The', 'film', 'one', 'zany', 'weekend', 'Byrnes', 'family', 'Greg', 'dating', 'Pam', 'Byrnes', 'Greg', 'marry', 'Pam', 'when', 'Pam', 'sister', 'Deborah', 'getting', 'married', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'asked', 'father', 'Jack', 'permission', 'Greg', 'must', 'now', 'get', 'permission', 'How', 'hard', 'could', 'be', 'right', 'Wrong', 'Jack', 'Byrnes', 'very', 'strict', 'gruff', 'man', 'obvious', 'Pam', 'golden', 'child', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'Pam', 'mother', 'Dina', 'complete', 'opposite', 'fact', 'really', 'like', 'Greg', 'eyes', 'Jack', 'Greg', 'far', 'good', 'enough', 'Pam.The', 'film', 'domino', 'effect', 'one', 'landed', 'gag', 'Greg', 'prove', 'worthy', 'Pam', 'hand', 'Yes', 'joke', 'home', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'funny', 'movie', 'actually', 'was', 'sequel', 'was', 'less', 'successful', 'loved', 'feel', 'repeat', 'original', 'high', 'entertainment', 'value.Ben', 'Stiller', 'role', 'hapless', 'Greg', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'accepted', 'marry', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'kind', 'left', 'back', 'burner', 'here', 'mainly', 'be', 'object', 'affection', ""n't"", 'really', 'given', 'anything', 'do', 'become', 'bored', 'most', 'time', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'down', 'never', 'allowed', 'drag', 'down', 'scene', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'hysterical', 'Dina', 'mentioned', 'before', 'movie', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'De', 'Niro', 'sadly', 'choice', 'film', 'taken', 'dive', 'recently', 'film', 'probably', 'last', 'great', 'performance', 'point', 'entire', 'film', 'genuinely', 'scene', 'stealing', 'hilarious', 'line', 'polish', 'charisma', 'believable', 'sincerity', 'need', 'have', 'when', ""'re"", 'most', 'frequent', 'word', ""Focker'.The"", 'end', 'film', 'course', 'family', 'together', 'Jack', 'sabotage', 'everything', 'lesson', 'think', 'resolve', 'why', 'Meet', 'Fockers', 'bit', 'complete', 'renig', 'finale', 'film', 'Regardless', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'should', 'serve', 'Grade-A', 'entertainment', 'family', 'should', 'result', 'quite', 'few', 'belly-laughs']",N/A

529949,ATXO4UA7N1HDC,B00003CXO0,Ari Weiss,"[1, 1]","Meet The Parents: rated PG-13, 1 hour and 47 minutesThere is chemistry between Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller in Meet The Parents, a hilarious serio-comedy that radiates a pleasant warmth. Robert De Niro is the belligerent, overprotective, overly judgmental father of the sweetheart Ben Stiller wishes to marry. Stiller's character, Greg, has fallen for the lovely Pam, played by Teri Polo, and is faced with the insufferable task of being accepted into her family in order to gain approval to marry her. Pam's father is an ex-CIA operative who is ""a human lie-detector"" and he uses this acquired skill to put Greg to the test at every possible moment, out of his irrational fear of losing his eldest daughter. When Greg is constantly set up for failure, it comes as no surprise that he becomes a failure. This is where the film reaches its most saddening moments. Though a lingering sorrow protrudes throughout a large portion of the movie, there are enough hysterical pranks and sidesplitting exchanges to keep the audiences in a light spirit and entertained.Jay Roach is a comical genius and he extends his soulful humor to Meet The Parents as he did so tactfully in the past with the Austin Powers movies. The script was thankfully rewritten from its original form as a one-man Jim Carrey vehicle to a head-to-head father versus son flick with Stiller and De Niro. It seems that the movie could have been easily a miss with audiences if written any other way, and feels like it just barely hits home because of all of the other comedies that have failed miserably with similar strains of humor.Blythe Danner is pleasing as the kooky but good-hearted mother of Greg's love interest. Teri Polo is also very good in her role as the girl being fought over by the two dominant men in her life. In addition, Jinxy the cat does an outstanding job as the extraordinarily well mannered, flamboyant, and funny family cat with whom Jack Burns (De Niro) shares a strong and intimate connection.Robert De Niro is at his comical peak in Meet The Parents. His mannerisms are extremely well thought out and work perfectly with the part. He is truly acting as opposed to telling jokes. He is dynamic and believable, not to mention exceedingly amusing. He outdoes his previous role in Analyze This.Last but not least, Ben Stiller is the heart and soul of the movie. As usual, the remarkably talented actor with a flair for comedy sparks the movie with every line and every gesture. He is such a loving protagonist that even when we watch him screw up throughout the entire movie, each time worse than the last, we still manage to forgive him. After all he is a male nurse, how can we not? In the spirit of There's Something About Mary, Mystery Men, and Keeping The Faith, Ben Stiller plays to perfection. Only this time with the addition of Robert De Niro, he surpasses our expectations of the movie and leaves us with a sweet taste in our mouths.Meet The Parents, directed by Jay Roach, also starring Owen Wilson is a cheerful and spirited comedy guaranteed to satisfy.

Ben Stiller stars as Greg Focker(I still laugh when I hear that)who wants to propose to his girlfriend Pam. Before doing so, he wants to ask her father's permission. And, wouldn't you know it, her father turns out to be a tough... ex cia agent. The part is perfectly played by a hilarious Robert DeNiro, who gives his best comedic performance here. The father doesn't take a liking to our poor hero Greg as one horrible mishap after another happens. After a while, you start actually feeling really sorry for Greg and almost don't want to laugh. But you do. Blythe Danner is nicely cast as the bride to be's mother. Her wife and De Niro's husband work well together. Owen Wilson shows up playing a sickeningly perfect ex-boyfriend of Pam's. The movie is not as silly or over the top as you'd want it to be. Imagine if Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler played Stiller's part!. Ben Stiller is a great comedic actor.

529956,A168Z6F8T9283S,B00003CXO0,bobjsmith,"[1, 1]","I'm not as hard on fluff as some of my artsy-fartsy friends. As long as I know it's fluff going in (and anyone who'd be expecting more than &quot;fluff&quot; from Meet the Parents is beyond help), I tend to be fairly easily amused, one way or the other.And Meet the Parents is just that -- amusing. A chucklesome diversion. It has a few decent laughs, but I entirely concede with any reviewer declaring that the movie is unoriginal, off the mark, and that the performances are nothing to write home about.I think a lot of people were disappointed because -- formulaic and trite as the concept of the film may be -- De Niro as the gruff, humorless future father-in-law, and Stiller as the hapless young son-in-law to be, for whom nothing will go right -- seemed like promising casting with real comedic potential. And in the end, it's not that the movie is altogether unfunny -- it's just that it's not, you know, THAT funny. You may smile, or chuckle, or even laugh out loud a few times, but you're not going to be rolling around on the floor. And towards the end, the film becomes oddly serious -- almost a tad depressing. Which rubs people the wrong way when they are ... well ... expecting pure, light-hearted fluff.Lacking in the hilarity department, it would help a great deal if Meet the Parents had some of the other qualities which I have already pointed out are missing -- originality, stellar performances, a witty and/or multilayered script. But these elements are nowhere to be seen. The &quot;cute pet Ben Stiller hates and doesn't get along with&quot; was already done in Something About Mary. The &quot;intimidating, protective, grumpy father&quot; schtick has been milked for all it was worth and more in movies like Father of the Bride. And the &quot;what ELSE could go wrong? -- OH, THAT! HA HA!&quot; style of humor, at this point in the development of mainstream comedy, is getting really, really tiresome. If you're going to do it, you need to do it well, and Meet the Parents only does it so-so.Ben Stiller, though not unsympathetic, gets pretty annoying after a while. I was only half-heartedly pulling for him. I'm not a big Stiller fan though. His whiney method of delivery rakes on my nerves. De Niro can of course hold his own, but his dialogue is fairly stilted, and the whole bit about him being a CIA agent -- aggh. Over-the-top, stupid, and not half as funny as it'd like to be. He has a good line here or there (&quot;I have nipples. Could you milk me?&quot;), but, fluff or no, I was expecting a little more.De Niro's wife -- oof -- bad move. She isn't funny at all. She comes off as really patheticly submissive and mindless, although I think they were TRYING for super-sweet and well-intended. I couldn't stand her. She reminded me of Ricky Fitts' mom in American Beauty. And those who have seen the movie recognize that that's more depressing than funny.So what it boils down to is that even for fluff, this one falls a bit short. But it passes the time, and has amusing moments here and there.",2,Passes the time.,990921600,"05 27, 2001",2001,3030,"[""'m"", 'not', 'as', 'hard', 'fluff', 'artsy-fartsy', 'friends', 'As', 'long', 'know', 'fluff', 'going', 'anyone', 'who', ""'d"", 'be', 'expecting', 'more', 'quot', 'quot', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'help', 'tend', 'be', 'fairly', 'easily', 'amused', 'one', 'way', 'other.And', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'just', 'amusing', 'chucklesome', 'diversion', 'few', 'decent', 'laughs', 'entirely', 'concede', 'reviewer', 'declaring', 'movie', 'unoriginal', 'off', 'mark', 'performances', 'are', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'about.I', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'disappointed', 'because', 'formulaic', 'trite', 'concept', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'De', 'Niro', 'gruff', 'humorless', 'future', 'father-in-law', 'Stiller', 'hapless', 'young', 'son-in-law', 'be', 'whom', 'nothing', 'will', 'go', 'right', 'seemed', 'promising', 'casting', 'real', 'comedic', 'potential', 'end', 'not', 'movie', 'altogether', 'unfunny', 'just', 'not', 'know', 'funny', 'may', 'smile', 'chuckle', 'even', 'out', 'loud', 'few', 'times', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'be', 'rolling', 'around', 'floor', 'end', 'film', 'oddly', 'serious', 'almost', 'tad', 'depressing', 'Which', 'people', 'wrong', 'way', 'when', 'are', 'well', 'expecting', 'pure', 'light-hearted', 'fluff.Lacking', 'hilarity', 'department', 'would', 'help', 'great', 'deal', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'had', 'other', 'qualities', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'are', 'missing', 'originality', 'stellar', 'performances', 'witty', 'and/or', 'multilayered', 'script', 'elements', 'are', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'quot', 'cute', 'pet', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'hates', ""n't"", 'get', 'quot', 'was', 'already', 'done', 'Something', 'Mary', 'quot', 'intimidating', 'protective', 'grumpy', 'father', 'quot', 'schtick', 'been', 'milked', 'was', 'worth', 'more', 'movies', 'Father', 'Bride', 'quot', 'what', 'ELSE', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'OH', 'HA', 'HA', 'quot', 'style', 'humor', 'point', 'development', 'mainstream', 'comedy', 'getting', 'really', 'really', 'tiresome', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'need', 'do', 'well', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'only', 'so-so.Ben', 'Stiller', 'not', 'unsympathetic', 'pretty', 'annoying', 'while', 'was', 'only', 'half-heartedly', 'pulling', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'Stiller', 'fan', 'whiney', 'method', 'delivery', 'rakes', 'nerves', 'De', 'Niro', 'can', 'course', 'hold', 'own', 'dialogue', 'fairly', 'stilted', 'whole', 'bit', 'being', 'CIA', 'agent', 'aggh', 'Over-the-top', 'stupid', 'not', 'half', 'as', 'funny', ""'d"", 'like', 'be', 'good', 'line', 'here', 'there', 'quot', 'have', 'nipples', 'Could', 'milk', 'quot', 'fluff', 'was', 'expecting', 'little', 'more.De', 'Niro', 'wife', 'oof', 'bad', 'move', ""n't"", 'funny', 'off', 'really', 'patheticly', 'submissive', 'mindless', 'think', 'were', 'TRYING', 'super-sweet', 'well-intended', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'reminded', 'Ricky', 'Fitts', 'mom', 'American', 'Beauty', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'recognize', 'more', 'depressing', 'funny.So', 'what', 'down', 'even', 'fluff', 'one', 'bit', 'short', 'time', 'amusing', 'moments', 'here', 'there']",N/A

529959,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00003CXO0,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[2, 2]","Arguably the best comedy of 2000, Meet The Parents is one of the best-written, humor-filled laughers since Caddyshack (1980). Screenwriters Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke should have received Oscars for their flawless presentation of a string of ironic gaffes and hilarious antics. But Meet The Parents wouldn't be the comedy masterpiece it is without the onscreen chemistry of Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. Stiller, son of comedian Jerry Stiller (Seinfeld & King Of Queens), is a comic genius in his own right and has recently dominated the Hollywood box office with a string of smash spoof comedies such as There's Something About Mary (1998), Zoolander (2001), Along Came Polly (2004), and Dodgeball (2004). De Niro, on the other hand, moves from the less serious roles of his early career into the comedy genre with an ease fully indicative of his enormous talent. Earlier comic roles in Wag The Dog (1997) and Analyze This (1999) prepared movie-goers for the veteran actor's zinging one-liners. Overall, the cast is superb, and Meet The Parents excels in the realm of over-the-top humor...Meet The Parents follows the hardship of Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker (Ben Stiller), a male nurse who travels with his fianc&eacute;e, Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), to meet his future in-laws. Pam's mother (Blythe Danner) seems alright enough, but her father, Jack (Robert De Niro), is a never-ending source of torment for the easy-going, bridge-building Greg. A retired CIA operative, Jack is paranoid and suspicious of the man who aspires to be his son-in-law, and he goes to great lengths to uncover skeletons in Greg's closet or otherwise drive a divide between his daughter and her future husband.Along the way, Greg must not only contend with the prying eyes of Jack Byrnes, but his hellacious feline companion Jinxie, Pam's perfect ex-boyfriend Kevin Rawley (Owen Wilson), and the infamous Jack-mandated, Byrne family ""circle of trust"". When Greg accidentally loses Jinxie, it sets off a chain of events that is so hilarious, most people will have to watch the segment multiple times in order to catch everything. Ultimately, Jack and Greg rectify their ""circle of trust"" issues when Jack does a background check on Greg that returns little info, prompting Greg to reveal that his full name is Gaylord - yes, his name is really Gay Focker...!Meet The Parents takes advantage of a common experience shared by its audience members and transforms this recurrent rite of passage into a truly hilarious night of entertainment. It is, quite simply, one of the funniest movies ever made. Directed by Jay Roach (director of the Austin Powers franchise), Meet The Parents is a true modern day comedy classic that, like a fine wine, only tastes better with the passage of time. It's one of those rare cinematic gems that can be watched over and over, yet still provoke shrieking laughter with relative ease. Successful enough to spawn a sequel, Meet The Fockers (which is in-and-of itself a memorable comedy), Meet The Parents is a definite must-see movie that you won't want to miss...The DVD Report",5,One of the best comedies ever produced...,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,3083,"['Arguably', 'best', 'comedy', '2000', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'one', 'best-written', 'humor-filled', 'laughers', 'Caddyshack', '1980', 'Screenwriters', 'Greg', 'Glienna', 'Mary', 'Ruth', 'Clarke', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'Oscars', 'flawless', 'presentation', 'string', 'ironic', 'gaffes', 'hilarious', 'antics', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'comedy', 'masterpiece', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Stiller', 'son', 'comedian', 'Jerry', 'Stiller', 'Seinfeld', 'King', 'Queens', 'comic', 'genius', 'own', 'right', 'recently', 'dominated', 'Hollywood', 'box', 'office', 'string', 'smash', 'spoof', 'comedies', 'such', 'Something', 'Mary', '1998', 'Zoolander', '2001', 'Along', 'Came', 'Polly', '2004', 'Dodgeball', '2004', 'De', 'Niro', 'other', 'hand', 'moves', 'less', 'serious', 'roles', 'early', 'career', 'comedy', 'genre', 'ease', 'fully', 'indicative', 'enormous', 'talent', 'Earlier', 'comic', 'roles', 'Wag', 'Dog', '1997', 'Analyze', '1999', 'prepared', 'movie-goers', 'veteran', 'actor', 'zinging', 'one-liners', 'Overall', 'cast', 'superb', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'excels', 'realm', 'over-the-top', 'humor', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'hardship', 'Gaylord', 'Greg', 'Focker', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'male', 'nurse', 'who', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Pam', 'Byrnes', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'meet', 'future', 'in-laws', 'Pam', 'mother', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'alright', 'enough', 'father', 'Jack', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'never-ending', 'source', 'torment', 'easy-going', 'bridge-building', 'Greg', 'retired', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Jack', 'paranoid', 'suspicious', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'son-in-law', 'great', 'lengths', 'uncover', 'skeletons', 'Greg', 'closet', 'otherwise', 'drive', 'divide', 'daughter', 'future', 'way', 'Greg', 'must', 'not', 'only', 'contend', 'prying', 'eyes', 'Jack', 'Byrnes', 'hellacious', 'feline', 'companion', 'Jinxie', 'Pam', 'perfect', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Kevin', 'Rawley', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'infamous', 'Jack-mandated', 'Byrne', 'family', 'circle', 'trust', 'When', 'Greg', 'accidentally', 'Jinxie', 'off', 'chain', 'events', 'so', 'hilarious', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'segment', 'multiple', 'times', 'order', 'catch', 'everything', 'Ultimately', 'Jack', 'Greg', 'rectify', 'circle', 'trust', 'issues', 'when', 'Jack', 'background', 'check', 'Greg', 'little', 'info', 'prompting', 'Greg', 'reveal', 'full', 'name', 'Gaylord', 'yes', 'name', 'really', 'Gay', 'Focker', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'advantage', 'common', 'experience', 'shared', 'audience', 'members', 'transforms', 'recurrent', 'rite', 'passage', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'night', 'entertainment', 'quite', 'simply', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Directed', 'Jay', 'Roach', 'director', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'franchise', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'true', 'modern', 'day', 'comedy', 'classic', 'fine', 'wine', 'only', 'better', 'passage', 'time', 'one', 'rare', 'cinematic', 'gems', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'yet', 'still', 'provoke', 'shrieking', 'laughter', 'relative', 'ease', 'Successful', 'enough', 'spawn', 'sequel', 'Meet', 'Fockers', 'in-and-of', 'memorable', 'comedy', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'definite', 'must-see', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

He decides to ask her father for permission to marry her. Soon, Greg realizes his could be father in law ain't right. He is a former CIA operative who may still be in the company, and everything Greg does is wrong, wrong, wrong. He also meets his girlfriend's ex-fiancee, played very well by Owen Wilson, who is the success everyone expects Greg to be.I think this film works, especially to anyone who has, is, or plans to be married, or even in a long term relationship. Ben Stiller is hilarious as Greg Focker, being sympathetic without being weak. I read Jim Carrey almost took this role, and I think he would have been all wrong for it. Robert DeNiro shows he can do comedy as well as drama, being menacing and funny at the same time. Blythe Danner, as DeNiro's wife, kind of fades into the furniture whenever DeNiro and Stiller get a chance to play off each other.The script is very funny without going over the top with a bunch of gross out gags. All the comedy unfolds and makes sense to the story, not like the Farrelly brothers, who seem to make up the disgusting stuff first, then fashion a screenplay around it. Although it veers into Chris Columbus/ John Hughes/ warm and fuzzy territory once in a while, it holds together well.Jay Roach has a great eye for suburban comedy, taking a nice upper middle class family and introducing regular middle class Stiller.

You can create an action film or horror film quite easily as long as its relatively original, but with comedy you need to be much smarter. About the only thing you can get away with is a bit of cliche with the storyline.This film is certainly very chilched. You only need take a look at the video box to know what it's about. Surely half the point of pretty much ANY type of film is that there are elements that you don't expect. A guy meet his fianc&eacute;'s parents and the Dad is very strict and inevitably he messes things up yet it all ends happily. How cute. If I have ruined the film for you, then your powers of logic really are rusty coz I figured it out without even seeing the film.Now all would be OK if the film was actually funny. After all, a joke is a joke. Simply put, its not. The amount of times I was tempted to leave the room and not bother watching it to the end were off the scale. I cannot remember a single joke or incident worth repeating. It's just one of those cringably unfunny films that makes you feel sorry for the actors involved. If you think I'm just being a bloke, I'm not. Just about every girl I've talked to who's seen the film thought it was about as funny as going to your own funeral.

De Niro's suspicious and overprotective nature mixed with the fact that Stiller sticks his foot in his mouth every time he opens it makes for some hilarious scenes.  Stiller's character, Greg, goes home to meet his girlfriend's parents (the father played by De Niro).  Stiller plays this character to a T.  His nervousness, his anxiousness to impress, his shyness around the family, all come across as natural.  His sense of timing in delivering his lines is impeccable.  We see some of De Niro's gangster roles in this character, but also a fatherly devotion towards his daughter (and an almost sickening devotion to the family cat!).  Some of the other reviewers have complained about De Niro moving into comedy, but the roles he's had have been great.A lot of the scenes in this movie were a bit predictable, but the way in which they are played by both Stiller and De Niro give them an all new spin.  And yes, a lot of the scenes are outrageously unbelievable, but, again, the actors make you believe a little bit more.This movie was not only funny, but a little romantic as well.

Fortunately for this movie, the entire cast believes in the film and give some great performances.  Robert DeNiro banks on his tough-guy image, so that he seems to be in command even wearing a fuzzy sweater and trading belly-bucks with Owen Wilson.  Ben Stiller is sincere and likeable even when blatently lying and trying to cover his tracks.  The reason for the latter - the film does a masterful job at setting up how a little white lie keeps coming back to bite Stiller's character in the butt.The female characters, although given less to do, ground the story in reality.  Teri Polo plays the fiancee to be, and does a subtle and vital transformation from confident professional woman to Daddy's Little Girl as she walks over the threshold of her parents' house.  But really, it's Blythe Danner as DeNiro's wife that acts as the vital brake and voice of reason on the silliness that keeps the situation barely under control until the correct moment.There is a surprising amount of heart and truth in the story.  Most everyone has been in that dreaded situation where they are desperate to fit in but can't.  The best scene in the film is a visit to the girl's ex-fiance's house.  They all end up in the pool playing volleyball.  Stiller is obviously in good shape, but is thrown in a pool with a bunch of type-A players who obviously play pool-volleyball a lot.  As the scene plays out, you really feel his isolation and pity him, while at the same time laughing at the absurdity of the other characters.  It's this kind of heart that allows the film to have an emotional payoff at the end, which raises it out of the humdrum and into the enjoyable.There are a number of different DVD versions of the film, varying in the number of extras.

I knew Ben Stiller was funny-but Robert De Niro? I couldn't believe it.The story has been told before in romantic comedy: a hapless groom, a male nurse, wants to propose to his girlfriend. They travel together to her WASP family's home (Blythe Danner is the Mom, thus the Wasp overtones) in Long Island for her sister's wedding. De Niro plays the father of the family, a retired &quot;flower importer&quot; (he actually is something else, but  I won't ruin the surprise), who delights in poking small and large fun at his bumbling prospective son-in-law.The movie follows Stiller and the family throughout the weekend and the very funny happenings and mishaps. Owen Wilson steals the movie as the former boyfriend.I would recommend this movie to those who enjoy broad comedies. If you want to see a different side to De Niro, this movie offers it. I wouldn't recommend this movie to those who need subtlety and nuance in their comedies-you won't get it here.I enjoyed the voice over commentary on the DVD (De Niro, Stiller, the director, and one other production person). De Niro offered some insights into how he came up with various facial expressions and improvised some lines. At times however, four people may have been too much as sometimes everyone became silent.But overall, a great, funny experience-",5,"Very Funny, DeNiro Makes You Laugh!",1053907200,"05 26, 2003",2003,1405,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'quot', 'preview.', 'quot', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'knew', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'was', 'funny-but', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'it.The', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'hapless', 'groom', 'male', 'nurse', 'propose', 'girlfriend', 'travel', 'together', 'WASP', 'family', 'home', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'Mom', 'thus', 'Wasp', 'overtones', 'Long', 'Island', 'sister', 'wedding', 'De', 'Niro', 'father', 'family', 'retired', 'quot', 'flower', 'importer', 'quot', 'actually', 'something', 'else', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'surprise', 'who', 'poking', 'small', 'large', 'fun', 'bumbling', 'prospective', 'son-in-law.The', 'movie', 'Stiller', 'family', 'weekend', 'very', 'funny', 'happenings', 'mishaps', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'movie', 'former', 'boyfriend.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'enjoy', 'broad', 'comedies', 'want', 'see', 'different', 'side', 'De', 'Niro', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'need', 'subtlety', 'nuance', 'comedies-you', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'enjoyed', 'voice', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'De', 'Niro', 'Stiller', 'director', 'one', 'other', 'production', 'person', 'De', 'Niro', 'offered', 'insights', 'how', 'came', 'up', 'various', 'facial', 'expressions', 'improvised', 'lines', 'times', 'however', 'four', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'much', 'sometimes', 'everyone', 'became', 'silent.But', 'overall', 'great', 'funny', 'experience-']",N/A

Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[0, 0]","Andy Speltzer manges to get ONE thing right on this product page in the Amazon Review editorial section about this movie.It is truly an ""incredibly well-crafted comedy"" a comedy of errors in the wonderful and intricately built tradition of Shakespeare's comedies, of Moiere, of Mr. Wilde's better romantic comedies, of the Greeks.It really is that good. I at first did not like the interruption of physical comedy bits, but the were so ""incredibly well-crafted"" a part of the overall plot, that it was hard to despise them, but to admire how well they worked to promote the tale.""an incredibly well-crafted comedy""The rest Andy got horribly, terribly wrong, of course.One evidence of the excellent craftsmanship here, as well and carefully done as Owen Wilson's wedding chapel, is the preview of coming jokes.For instance, we have the confusion early on over Stiller's character's first name, Glen or Greg, which sets us up for the climactic punchline of his real first name (no spoiler here!)And this is only one small sample.He picks out boxer's from the potential brother-in-law's dresser drawer (having lost his own clothes in an airline mix-up which truly advances the plot) as a foreshadow of how he will be required to dress for the pool.And, you know, we see within that scene that Ben Stiller was in excellent condition for one required to play a nerdy fool of the 95th percentile.There is much here that is so well done from the tradition of our finest comedies in Western European literature, with just enough interjection of dumb physical humour to please the groundlings and the american audience, each such physical bit of comedy nevertheless excused by having an essential part for the plot. But please, this script leaves us room to read this at a very sophisticated level.Like any hero, or anti'hero, in Western Literature, the main character, Stiller's, bears a fatal flaw, which in its resolution resolves the problem of the plot. Here the young Fokker cannot tell the truth and be honest from the start. By learning to speak honestly by the time of that final interrogation scene, and to confront honestly the future father in law with honest questions and challenges, we find the plot resolves quite neatly and convincingly.There was much I could not accept as real, but made sense by the end of the film. Who would stick around with Deniro as potential father in law; who would bear such indignities and humiliations? In that climactic interrogation scene we find out. Someone who loves the daughter (SPOILER?). Owen WIlson's character did, and does, and the reason they split I did not hear explicitly explored but one expects it is DeNiro, the dragon whom Ben Stiller overcomes, with honesty.I hate myself for loving this movie, and I hope to see it again, from the start.There really is much to love here. We are safe to like this film. It is NOT the worst ever, and may be one of the hidden best.Okay, so, well, no, it is not manipulative, anymore than the great romantic comedies of our tradition, from Wilde to Moliere to Shakespeare to the Greeks are manipulative.

Ben Stiller proved he's comic genius, Teri Polo burst onto the scene and Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner stole the entire show.  I just have to say I'm so glad my father-in-law isn't THIS insane.Ben Stiller plays Greg Focker, a male nurse who's about to pop the question to girlfriend Pam (Polo) but before he can get it out she gets word that her sister is engaged.  What makes this a bad thing is that Greg then finds out how old fashioned Pam's father is and realizes before he can propose he needs to ask her fathers permission.  Her father Jack (De Niro) is not just an intimidating man, he's an ex-member of the CIA who is bent on exposing Greg for the sap he's certain he must be.With Greg trying too hard to impress everyone he ends up making things much worse for himself, lying to make himself look better, losing Jack's precious cat Jinxie, flooding the backyard with sewage and quite a few other embarrassing and damaging things.  What makes this film so delightful is the chemistry between every actor here; no one seems miscast despite what you may think.De Niro is fantastic here proving once and for all that he's one of our greatest actors, and Blythe Danner is just hilarious as Pam's mother Dina.  Great supporting performances by Owen Wilson (proving yet again that paired with Stiller they are dynamic) and James Rebhorn who's hilarious as Dr. Larry Banks.

Fincke ""thegreatfandincke""","[3, 8]","For a movie that did so well that they wound up doing those obnoxious commercials where they tell you how you should go see the film again because you loved the scene where the vase fell just so much...  I was expecting to be truly entertained.  But I was only mildly entertained.The big funny scenes seemed to stiff and forced and formulaic.  They were not without humor but neither did they brim with it.  De Niro was good but for the most part a bit too good at being unlikable and threatening.But worst for me was the assumption of the film that the parents of this girl MUST like whoever she happens to bring home.  The fact that Ben Stiller LIES to her parents from the moment he meets them makes him a hero that I just didn't feel like rooting for.  He does not earn their respect and so I don't see why the audience should support the girl's parents lowering their standards to give it to him.  Yes, he is under duress from De Niro's character's demeanor, BUT we already know that he has approved of other men in his daughters' lives.  Even if he has SOME &quot;letting go&quot; issues that does not mean he should rubber stamp with approval just any body that his daughter brings home.  And I could not see why he SHOULD like Ben Stiller's character; what were his virtues precisely?These might sound like over-critical observations but I think they are precisely what make a comedy fail or succeed.  Comedies are funny when their protagonists are worth sympathizing with as they suffer for their flaws or because of unfortunate circumstances.  There must be redeeming qualities or they must learn from the comedic results of their erroneous ways and represent our struggle to come to terms with such persistent and irrational failings.  In the end of this film, in contrast, I felt like the message was that Ben Stiller did not need to grow but that De Niro was supposed to just &quot;suck it up&quot; that his daughter loved this guy.  De Niro was the one that needed to change, not Stiller.I just didn't like the attitude of the film, the assumption we are expected to have in running future spouses by parental inspection that one should expect a rubber stamp and that any thing else would be unnecessary harshness.  Are their some inappropriately critical parents or overprotective or unsympathetic ones, I am sure there are.  Just illustrate them in their particularity in an instance in which their injustice is obvious and not in a case where their concerns are rather valid ones, like about the integrity of the person their child is to marry.With all this said, there are a few &quot;just&quot; laughs along the way, that are worth watching for, including ones in a pool volleyball game and those involving Ben Stiller's unfairly condescended to career prospects.

529989,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00003CXO0,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[11, 16]","Let's see.  Ben Stiller plays some poor schmuck who has somehow managed to land a girlfriend far out of what should be his league, makes a complete fool out of himself time and time again trying to keep that girl, and everything magically works out in the end for no apparent reason - and there's a beloved pet in the story, too.  Hmmm, this sounds familiar.  I really don't know how I ended up watching yet another Ben Stiller movie, since Ben Stiller is one of my least favorite actors, but Meet the Parents has its funny moments, benefits greatly from the talents of the consummate actor himself, Robert De Niro, and ends up being fairly entertaining albeit redundant.Ben Stiller plays Greg Focker, a name which leads to countless jokes throughout the film, a male nurse who has somehow won the affections of a certain Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo); his elaborate plan to propose to Pam is stymied when he learns Pam's sister is getting married in two weeks and - shudder - he is about to meet Pam's parents.  Naturally, he's nervous and tries tremendously hard to make a good impression.  Unfortunately, dear old Dad (Robert De Niro) is very hard to please and Greg, being the naturally ill-fated nincompoop he is, manages to mess up time and time again - big-time; I'm talking 100 times worse than Steve Urkel here.  I won't go into any details, so as not to take away from the hilarity that ensues - well, it's good for a few laughs, anyway.The film actually has a great cast.  De Niro more than makes up for Stiller's faults, and Owen Wilson is a great addition as Pam's smarmy ex-fianc&eacute;.  If you like There's Something About Mary, you are sure to enjoy Meeting the Parents, as it is really just more of the same type of comedy.  The comedy actually goes a little too far, if you ask me, because there is no way that any family could accept Greg Focker after all of the damage he causes over the course of a mere weekend.The movie is helped by the fact that most people can identify with Greg Focker and the trauma of meeting prospective in-laws for the first time, especially guys having to worry about staking a claim to daddy's little girl.  Personally, I like the fact that this movie didn't go to any gross-out extremes; barring a few common curse words and a steady supply of jokes about Greg Focker's name, this is a pretty family-friendly film.  There's nothing very original about it, but Meeting the Parents is pretty entertaining and is sure to get a few grins out of even the most curmudgeonly of viewers.",4,"Another stereotypical Stiller comedy, but it is funny",1098662400,"10 25, 2004",2004,2524,"['Let', 'see', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'poor', 'schmuck', 'who', 'somehow', 'managed', 'land', 'girlfriend', 'far', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'league', 'complete', 'fool', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'trying', 'keep', 'girl', 'everything', 'magically', 'out', 'end', 'apparent', 'reason', 'beloved', 'pet', 'story', 'too', 'Hmmm', 'familiar', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'yet', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'movie', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'funny', 'moments', 'benefits', 'greatly', 'talents', 'consummate', 'actor', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'up', 'being', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'redundant.Ben', 'Stiller', 'Greg', 'Focker', 'name', 'countless', 'jokes', 'film', 'male', 'nurse', 'who', 'somehow', 'won', 'affections', 'certain', 'Pam', 'Byrnes', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'elaborate', 'plan', 'propose', 'Pam', 'stymied', 'when', 'Pam', 'sister', 'getting', 'married', 'two', 'weeks', 'shudder', 'meet', 'Pam', 'parents', 'Naturally', 'nervous', 'tremendously', 'hard', 'make', 'good', 'impression', 'Unfortunately', 'dear', 'old', 'Dad', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'very', 'hard', 'please', 'Greg', 'being', 'naturally', 'ill-fated', 'nincompoop', 'mess', 'up', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'big-time', ""'m"", 'talking', '100', 'times', 'worse', 'Steve', 'Urkel', 'here', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'so', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'hilarity', 'well', 'good', 'few', 'laughs', 'anyway.The', 'film', 'actually', 'great', 'cast', 'De', 'Niro', 'more', 'up', 'Stiller', 'faults', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'great', 'addition', 'Pam', 'smarmy', 'ex-fianc', 'eacute', 'like', 'Something', 'Mary', 'are', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'Meeting', 'Parents', 'really', 'just', 'more', 'same', 'type', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'actually', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'ask', 'way', 'family', 'could', 'accept', 'Greg', 'Focker', 'damage', 'course', 'mere', 'weekend.The', 'movie', 'helped', 'fact', 'most', 'people', 'can', 'identify', 'Greg', 'Focker', 'trauma', 'meeting', 'prospective', 'in-laws', 'first', 'time', 'especially', 'guys', 'having', 'worry', 'staking', 'claim', 'daddy', 'little', 'girl', 'Personally', 'like', 'fact', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'gross-out', 'extremes', 'barring', 'few', 'common', 'curse', 'words', 'steady', 'supply', 'jokes', 'Greg', 'Focker', 'name', 'pretty', 'family-friendly', 'film', 'nothing', 'very', 'original', 'Meeting', 'Parents', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'sure', 'get', 'few', 'grins', 'even', 'most', 'curmudgeonly', 'viewers']",N/A

Having seen that movie, I didn't have high hope for this one but recently I passed the time by finally watching it. What a pleasant surprise, this movie was funny, a perfect blend of humor that was at times clever and at other times, slapstick. Ben Stiller playes Greg Focker, the Jewish suitor of the daughter of a tough, former CIA man named Jack Byrnes, hystreically played by Robert DiNiro. Armed with a polygraph and an inquisitorial manner, Jack, the overly protective father, is out to find out all he can about Greg. Meanwhile, Greg is visiting at the same time that there is a family wedding about to take place at the Byrnes residence.Naturally, the pressure that Jack puts on Greg causes Greg to tighten up. Anything that possibly can go wrong will and, ultimately does. Of course, the fact that there are wedding preparations taking place leads to a number of disasterous screwups to the wedding preparations as Greg, in his nervousness, manages to unintentionally wreak havoc on the upcoming affair. Complicating manners are incorrect assumptions by both Greg and Jack and these misunderstandings maginifies the screwups (for example, Jack erroneously believes that Greg is an active marijuana user).Naturally, there is a happy ending (in this type of comedy, doesn't that go without saying?). However, on the way, the major slapstick pratfalls make this an entertaining movie.

529996,A35UNON2GI8C0R,B00003CXO0,David Kusumoto,"[2, 5]","This is a film that I winced at every time I saw its trailer.  There was nothing funny about it at all and I initially thought it was a HUGE mistake on the part of DeNiro and Stiller to do a film like this.  I had NO intention of seeing what looked to me like a one-joke, sophomoric film aimed at people in their teens and 20s, at the exclusion of the rest of us old fogies.So what happened?Opening week, good word of mouth, great reviews...So the next weekend, I went in and found myself howling out loud, doubled over at how crazy and deliriously funny this picture was.The thing you have to remember is that trailers and ads usually give away most of the best scenes and are solely responsible for getting people off their rears and into their cars and into their seats at the theater.  A marketer's job is to make a bad film into a winner on opening weekend, at whatever cost.  This is why so many bad films come up big at the box office on opening day and then peeter out in a couple of weeks.  To make matters worse, I was unimpressed with the ads and trailers to &quot;Meet the Parents.&quot;  I hated the whole ad campaign as much as those dumb commercials on TV by an unnamed hamburger chain.But while watching &quot;Meet the Parents,&quot; the context of these scenes were fleshed out and the result was equal parts nonsense and intelligence.  It made the film a first class winner, the funniest picture of the year.Please note that I PAY to see more than 50 films a year, and I don't do it for a living.  Seeing movies in a theater are a joy, and to me, time is more important than money.  &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; lowered my expectations going in and it came out a winner, big time.  It's on my list of the top ten pictures released in 2000.I was amazed at how the story piled on layer after layer of wild situations; it was like watching one of those great screwball romantic comedies of the 30s and 40s.  The best thing about &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; is that the material is not, as one favorable critic put it, &quot;dumbed down&quot; despite its premise.  You FEEL for Stiller's predicaments and his frustration as things get worse.  And when it does, it doesn't make you feel exasperated, impatient or frustrated.  It's hilarious.  You also FEEL for DeNiro's suspicions as an overly protective father who borders on being chillingly insane.  My favorite scenes are the &quot;crying poem recital,&quot; the &quot;drag race&quot; (won't say anything more about those, see them yourself!) and the stuff going on at the airport.So the trailers had me fooled.Reflecting back, there were two keys to this film's success.The first key is the execution of each scene.  You might not be impressed when someone tries to explain the film to you, but when you see it on the big screen, you see how there is a logical progression to the insanity that develops in &quot;Meet the Parents.&quot;  The insanity, it's hard to explain, makes sense when it plays out, and it doesn't take any marvelous or expensive special effects to &quot;push&quot; the comedy at all.  It's played straight and that's what makes &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; funny.The second key to the success of &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; is the most important...Ben Stiller is so damned perfect for this role.Despite the sheer nuttiness of this film and the horrible situations he gets thrown in, Stiller's innate intelligence comes through.  Despite what happens, he's not an idiot.  His reactions are priceless and he doesn't play the role as a dufus.  He's a guy with common sense who desperately wants acceptance by DeNiro.  That's why you root for him.  He's not overly attractive in any conventional way -- but his charisma as an actor in this role shines because he does what he does best -- and that is to play each scene like a smart guy who can't believe the things that can go wrong IN SPITE of the well thought out, meticulous planning and foresight that any smart person would do, and he demonstrates as much to the audience when he goes through the motions to try to please his fiancee's family in a big, big way.  When he fails, he can't believe it.  And neither do we.&quot;Meet the Parents&quot; is wall-to-wall fun, the most pleasant movie-going surprise of 2000.  And the ending is wonderful.  The last scene before the credits is practically given away in the trailer (again, I won't mention it), but where they put it in the film is priceless...Get it!",5,What a surprise!

And it turned out to be a very entertaing, freshing departure from the norm of most comedy's. Here's something i could sort of relate to...well not entirly. But i could sort of undertsand where this guy is coming from. Meets the parents of your love one for the first time, it could be quit tough, i mean trying to impress them, showing them that your willing to go out of their way for their daughter , that you really deserve her. And while trying to do such a thing can be quit troublesome, ..Trust me, i know...boy do I know. And alot what you try to get across comes out the wrong way, not the way you intended. It's either how you come across to the folks, how you talk, how smart you are, your likes, your dislikes, how willing you are, coming up with one single converstation that won't fall flat in the last 2 minutes. And as much as you try, you could never get where you want to go. This could be just as depressing when it comes to acutally talking and trying to impress a girl in general, a girl that seems to like you, but in a way doesn't. Your confused , you don't know what to think, your verbal comunication with her,...can be alot better than it is. The trouble is that you don't know how to fully open up around her. Sure your a nut-ball when it comes being around your best buds. But when your around her, everything is different. Theres a simple joy of seeing her happy, seeing that cute smile of hers'. You try and you try, and from day to day it seems less sucessful, you look back at the days when your did thought were impresing her, and say to yourself.&quot;Maybe I should just give up..&quot; Then your realize it wasn't their doing,..but yours. It's your disadvantage of being who you are. Your shy, your not very good at making conversation, and you then blame it all on yourself. And when that happens depression kicks into full gear. You find yourself doing things that you wouldn't normally do, walking the town for no reason, just collecting your thoughts, as you sip a cold beer. Life can be cruel, but you know what, you are your own worst enemy. Time goes on, and after a while and you don't know what to think. All of this is what this movie represents, while I was watching this, I really felt bad for the guy, but it made me think on how pointless and unmeaningful my life really is. Here is a guy who in the end really suceeded, who acutally made it to FIRST base. This is one of the main reasons what made this movie so charming. And in the end I really felt for them , and i was really happy for the couple. Becasue I was seeing something that will never happen to me, something I yern for. Something that I wish for, with this girl that i really love. There's all these conflicting images, and symbols, one of them being the ex-boyfreind, the competion, the struggle. In my case the boyfriend that has her, and doesn't seem to let her go. But in the end the ex-boyfreind winds up being greatful, forgiving, happy for his new rival. That he is lucky enough to have such a great girl, I tend to feel the same way at times, I think , well as long as she is happy, i'll be happy. And you want to tell her boyfreind that he is the luckyiest SOB on the planet, and he is. This movie is both touching, and flat-out Hilarious. This film is just as much a comedy as it is a Love Satire, and it's a winner in both areas. The peformances are wonderful, Robert De Niro never fails to impress me, one of the greatest dramatic actors who ever lived, and what a shame it would be, when he finnally leaves us, something I would never hope for.

But one film did stand out, and that was Meet The Parents. This film has Ben Stiller basically reprising his character from There's Something About Mary, but still manages to include all the charm and comic timing. He plays Gaylord &quot;Greg&quot; Focker(this name provides some of the best jokes in the film!)who after proposing to the woman he loves, heads to her parents home to meet with them.Unfortunately, this includes her father, a retired florist played by the always-incredible Robert De Niro. He immediately takes a disliking to Greg with a hard edge towards him, and some of the best scenes that follow is him trying to impress De Niro. One of the first laugh-out-loud scenes involves a dear family member's cremated ashes being treated rather unconventionally after a series of mishaps at the dinner table. I won't go into details, because I do not want to spoil it. There are a few plot twists later on that keep the story fresh, mostly regarding De Niro's retired florist.There are not too many movies that I recommend you buy without seeing first, especially comedies, because so many people have different tastes in comedies. But I do recommend Meet The Parents; it has a great director, Jay Roach(Austin Powers I and II), 2 fine comic actors, and a wonderful script and story.

Needless to say I was very relieved when it was finally over.There were only two people in this film that could actually act and they were Ben and Robert. The woman who was cast as Greg's wife was simply terrible! Not only was she unattractive, she just did not know how to act. I have absolutely no idea how she ended up with a role in this film. I fear for the future of movies if Hollywood keeps this up.As for the ""comedic"" scenes of this supposed comedy, they weren't all that funny to be honest. In fact, almost everything I have seen in this film, I have seen in MTV movies that were indeed worse but nonetheless the first to try out everything that was done in this movie. I found myself increasingly bored with the plot. The only time I was actually paying attention was close to the end, but the ending bored me again. This movie is unimpressive and very dull.

530002,A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8,B00003CXO0,Desmond Chan,"[17, 22]","MEET THE PARENTS is billed as the hysterical comedy of the year and the vociferous accolades is justified because of the impeccable acting and the outstanding supporting ensemble. Robert De Niro is at his best in this comedy with his wry humour and irresistible dry wits. Ben Stiller charms as the male paramedic, Greg Focker who embarks on a treacherous &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; session when he decides to settle down with Pam (Teri Polo). A series of accidents happen and Greg begins to reconsider his options when her ex-boyfriend played by Owen Wilson stepped in. The whole mess including breaking the urn of De Niro's beloved mother and the reciting of the &quot;prayer&quot;, breaking the nose of Pam's sister at a volleyball game - makes such a hilarious turn and imaginative gloss to the plot.However, it is the acting that shines - especially De Niro and Stiller with such perfect comedic timing that they fill up the screen with luminous presence. Never a dull moment, although the slapsticks do occur - &quot;Puff the Magic Dragon &quot; and all the cranky jokes on Focker's name - makes it entertaining and accessible yet not crude. The director Jay Roach (AUSTIN POWERS) sits back prudently to watch the two leads steal the show with their effervescent chemistry. Never mind the plot - just watch the two male actors enchant.

When attempting to ""pop the questions"" to her, he's interrupted when she gets a phone call from her sister and her sister tells her that she just got engaged to her boyfriend and that they were going to get married.  Now Pam has to go home for her sister's wedding and Greg has to meet her parents for the first time.  Greg then decides that this is the perfect opportunity to get to know her folks, get close with them and ultimately gain the trust to marry Pam.  Boy was he ever wrong!This movie is all about what could go wrong in one weekend.  Ben Still and Robert DeNiro steal the entire show, the whole way through.  Honestly, after a while you really start to believe that DeNiro and Stiller really have a heated rivalry.  Plus the humor is just funny, from the one-liners to the physical comedy to the sweet but funny as hell romantic comedy in this movie, your ribs will be killing for days.This is a great romantic comedy, a perfect way to study as well for anyone who's meeting their girlfriend/boyfriend's parents for the first time.

530011,A1655SGPPUUCRP,B00003CXO0,Emily Todd,"[0, 1]","""Meet the Parents"" is a surprisingly funny film bolstered into the top ranks of modern comedies by the two standout performances of Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller.  There's never a dull moment in this laugh-a-minute comedy from director Jay Roach of the ""Austin Power's"" franchise and screenwriters Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke, who also wrote and starred in the 1992 short film of the same name.Gaylord `Greg' Focker (just you try and say that last name without smiling), played to the max by the comic talents of Stiller, is head-over-heels in love with his girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo).  After a failed attempt at proposing marriage, Greg learns that if he intends to marry Pam, it is important to first OK the proposition with her father, Jack (De Niro).  Pam's sister's wedding seems a perfect time to talk with Jack, so he accompanies Pam back to her parent's house.  What ensues is a fantastically funny film, basically about the trouble and misunderstandings Greg endures for his love for Pam.The awkward dynamics between De Niro and Stiller's characters make for the most side-splitting moments of the film.  Upon having first viewed this movie several years ago, I can still clearly remember Greg's notions of milking cats, Jack's ""poetry reading"", the urn, the polygraph, Greg's prayer, the Speedo, Focker...  Those who have already seen ""Meet the Parents"", (and who hasn't?) are probably fondly reminiscing upon these positively hysterical scenes right now.""Meet the Parents"" certainly isn't cinematic art, folks.  The screenplay is predictable, at best.  And maybe some of the jokes didn't strike a chord with every audience member.  However, this film greatly succeeds at what it is; a comedy.  I will most certainly be first in line to see ""Meet the Fockers"", slated for release in December of 2004.",5,"&quot;Now Greg, you have a *very* unique last name...&quot;",1083283200,"04 30, 2004",2004,1818,"['Meet', 'Parents', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'film', 'bolstered', 'top', 'ranks', 'modern', 'comedies', 'two', 'standout', 'performances', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'laugh-a-minute', 'comedy', 'director', 'Jay', 'Roach', 'Austin', 'Power', 'franchise', 'screenwriters', 'Greg', 'Glienna', 'Mary', 'Ruth', 'Clarke', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'starred', '1992', 'short', 'film', 'same', 'name.Gaylord', 'Greg', 'Focker', 'just', 'try', 'say', 'last', 'name', 'smiling', 'played', 'max', 'comic', 'talents', 'Stiller', 'head-over-heels', 'love', 'girlfriend', 'Pam', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'failed', 'attempt', 'proposing', 'marriage', 'Greg', 'marry', 'Pam', 'important', 'first', 'OK', 'proposition', 'father', 'Jack', 'De', 'Niro', 'Pam', 'sister', 'wedding', 'perfect', 'time', 'talk', 'Jack', 'Pam', 'back', 'parent', 'house', 'What', 'fantastically', 'funny', 'film', 'basically', 'trouble', 'misunderstandings', 'Greg', 'love', 'Pam.The', 'awkward', 'dynamics', 'De', 'Niro', 'Stiller', 'characters', 'make', 'most', 'side-splitting', 'moments', 'film', 'having', 'first', 'viewed', 'movie', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'still', 'clearly', 'remember', 'Greg', 'notions', 'milking', 'cats', 'Jack', 'poetry', 'reading', 'urn', 'polygraph', 'Greg', 'prayer', 'Speedo', 'Focker', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'who', ""n't"", 'are', 'probably', 'fondly', 'reminiscing', 'positively', 'hysterical', 'scenes', 'right', 'now', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'cinematic', 'art', 'folks', 'screenplay', 'predictable', 'best', 'maybe', 'jokes', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'chord', 'audience', 'member', 'However', 'film', 'greatly', 'what', 'comedy', 'will', 'most', 'certainly', 'be', 'first', 'line', 'see', 'Meet', 'Fockers', 'slated', 'release', 'December', '2004']",N/A

Though it is funny in parts, as is often the case with blockbusters I am left scratching my head at its runaway popularity.  Comparisons with ""There's Something About Mary"" are unavoidable.  Ben Stiller plays the same kind of sincere but hapless character in each film and they both have a wry and offbeat presentation.  However, the humor in this film is far more lowbrow than ""Mary"".  It is also highly predictable.  The least perceptive of viewers can see the outcome of each gag a mile away.I suppose there is an element of identification with the premise, since most people remember their own consternation at the big meeting with the parents of their beloved.  Perhaps the appeal of the film is that we love to laugh at people who are more luckless than we are, and Greg (Ben Stiller) clearly has no equal when it comes to the bad luck he has in this film.Ben Stiller is fast establishing himself as one of the most accomplished Sad Sacks in film today.  He portrays characters with such sincerity and misfortune that you can't help but love him.  In this film, he continues that tradition with an outstanding performance as Greg.  Robert De Niro, who is a great dramatic actor, continues his recent trend away from serious drama and toward offbeat comedy roles (""Flawless"", ""Analyze This"", ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"").  Although his very presence in films like this is comical due to its incongruity, he is not a particularly good comedian.  I'm looking forward to seeing him in his latest film ""Fifteen Minutes"" which is a more serious dramatic role better suited to his enormous talent.  I was very impressed with Teri Polo, who played Pam.  She has genuineness and an affable nature that is well suited for romantic comedy.This is a good comedy, but nowhere near as good as the box office would lead us to believe.  I rated it a 7/10.

I especially liked Jack's tuxedo -- Especially with the top hat. If you ask me, that gave it a nice touch. The ending, however, made no sense to me. It's hard for me to explain why. In conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend this smash hit to all you Robert De Niro or Ben Stiller fans out there who have not seen it.

Mainly because in this movie, Greg Focker reminds me a lot of Clark Griswold. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing. I happen to love the National Lampoon's Vacation movies. That's probably why I liked Meet The Parents so much, because it probably would've fit right in.Basically, this movie involves Greg Focker, a male nurse, who's about to propose to his girlfriend, Pam. They fly home to, well, meet the parents. At first, Greg seems a bit frightened by Pam's father, Jack. Why? Because Jack happens to be an ex-CIA agent. That's when the Griswold-esque situations start to happen. He pops champagne, and the cork hits the urn containing Jack's mother's ashes. Then the cat, well, you know. (ed note - the review title comes from the cat scene where Greg talks about milking a cat) Then, while playing volleyball, he gives Pam's sister, a one week away bride-to-be, a black eye. He gets arrested for saying the word &quot;Bomb&quot; on an airplane. Let's not forget the infamous lie-detector test scene. There's also some hilarious marijuana references (Puff the Magic Dragon has a whole new meaning), and some rather disturbing scenes involving the cat using the toilet. And so on, and so forth.As for the DVD, the video's great. You can see everything perfectly clear. Universal seems to take DVD very seriously (which all movie studios should do), and the quality really shows on this one. However, they need to do more with the extras. The extras - you get the standard commentary track, two deleted scenes which aren't very funny, the standard DVD trailer, and outtakes, mainly which show you the fact that Robert De Niro has a hard time keeping a straight face. Otherwise, this is a very funny movie, and a great buy.

DeNiro's playful eyes sparkle mischief; the things he'll do to his daughter's boyfriend &quot;Greg Focker&quot; (played by the master comic Ben Stiller) just to keep him at bay and careful not to pursue his beloved daughter in matrimony are classic.  The cast of &quot;characters&quot; adds so much to the story, especially the cat &quot;Mr. Jinx&quot; who is trained to use the toilet; the former boyfriend who is that apple of dad's eyes; the mother (played by Blythe Danner) who is an elegant juxiposition to her retired CIA agent husband (DeNiro).  And look for these scenes that will have you in stitches, especially ones with: an urn over the mantle, an exploding septic tank disaster, the fire in the yard, and when the whole family decides to play volleyball in the pool.

The reason this is so hilarious to me is that Ben Stiller portrays an ordinary guy in a very real situation.Stiller is Greg Fokker, who just wants to marry his girlfriend Pam. I really dont want to spoil it for anybody, but the two end up going to Pam's parents because her sister is getting married. Greg sees this as an opportunity to meet her parents and gain their approval of his proposal to Pam. The interaction between Greg and Pam's father, played by one of the greatest actors ever--Robert DeNiro, is just hilarious also. From the start he doesn't like Greg. And just about everything that could go wrong does go wrong, and Greg is always to blame. These are the kind of things you think could happen to you in real life, only here everything really does go wrong. I could write about some of the funniest parts of this,like when Pam's brother discovers a statue in Greg's jacket, or when Greg(Jewish) is nominated to say grace before dinner, but I think that it is best to watch this yourself. If you have never seen it you may be surprised. But like I said, you owe it to yourself to see this great movie. Robert Deniro and Ben Stiller are great in their roles in this movie. And for those who have seen it, the sequel Meet the Fokkers is in the works and I believe it will be released later in 2004, so see this one soon.

The couple travel to her parent's home in Oyster Bay, Long Island, and all hell breaks loose.Greg desperately wants to be accepted by his hopeful future in-laws, and will go to any length to ingratiate himself - which is his problem.  He will say or do anything to make these people like him, and with Pam's dad, it's a losing proposition.  A retired CIA profiler, DeNiro is suspicious and distrustful, and a private war, with Pam as the object, begins as soon as they meet.At its core, Meet the Parents wants to be a Peter Sellers farce, and at many points it works (and I could actually see Sellers playing both roles - maybe even at once in a case of stunt casting along the lines of The Party and Dr Strangelove).  The film is basically a series of screw-ups, each more excruciating than the last, and Roach does a good job of creating serious tension without ever letting things get too over the top.What sells the tension, though, are the performances of Stiller and DeNiro.  DeNiro has been on a comedy kick recently, and this is his best comedic performance yet.  He is able to do more with a single reaction shot than most comedic actors can do with a whole performance.  Stiller is making a career out of roles like this - the nervous, skittery put-upon guy.I've heard people complain that Meet the Parents is sitcomish.  What I think they are really getting at is the movie's basic geniality.  Even when the film tries to be edgy (and having a cat pee on someone's ashes is definitely edgy), it never goes over the line to be mean spirited or crude.  While both Stiller and DeNiro do things that are destructive and potentially cruel, both actors are able to sell the basic humanity of the characters - you know their motivations and are willing to forgive their ridiculous behavior.Meet the Parents isn't pushing the envelope the way a Farrelly Brothers movie does - on the commentary track Roach mentions that he agonized over including what toilet humor there is in the film. It does manage to get in some classic moments (including one of the best chase scenes I have ever seen, and a third act airport scene that is priceless), and the supporting performances are great as well.  Owen Wilson is hilarious as Pam's ex-boyfriend who can do no wrong, James Rebhorn brings the best pronunciation of ""Focker"" to the proceedings, and Blythe Danner quietly steals almost every scene she's in.I didn't see this movie in the theatres, and without renting it, I bought it on DVD, and was pretty happy with it the first time.

In 1999, he made the sequel, and now, instead of sequelizing and spoofing, Roach has turned to remakes, and with Meet the Parents, he proudly surpasses his sequel to Austin Powers, and with his star-studded cast, the team have come up with a sporadically funny motion picture, a must-see for all people who want a good laugh, any time of the day.A Jewish male nurse named Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) plans to ask his live-in girl friend Pam (Teri Polo) to marry him. However, he learns that her strict father Jack (Robert DeNiro) expects to be asked for his daughter's hand before she can accept. Thus begins the visit from Hell as the two travel to meet Mum (Blythe Danner) and Dad, who turns out to be former CIA with a lie detector in the basement. Coincidentally, a sister (Nicole DeHuff) of Pam's also has announced her wedding to a young doctor (Thomas McCarthy). Of course everything that can go wrong does, including the disappearance of Dad's beloved Himalayan cat, Jinxie.Of course, Jay Roach has made sequels and spoofs and now remakes, but he doesn't insist on other pieces of film to make the film that he has created. This film is very different to the 1992 smash hit and much, much better. There are many reasons to praise this oddball film, including it's eagerness to keep the audience entertained by using totally new jokes we never saw coming. Another thing is its great performance from the cast. Robert DeNiro does comedy again and he hasn't been this good in God knows how long, Ben Stiller is truly hilarious as Greg Focker (that's comedy for you!), he is quickly becoming one of my favourite comedic performers. Also on the hotline are Teri Polo and Blythe Danner, especially Danner as a nice mother caught in funny, difficult and totally strange situations.Meet the Parents is, quite simply, the most plausible romantic comedy of the year 2000!

530057,A18BV4O63DOWNH,B00003CXO0,"""juno2""","[3, 14]","In  *Meet The Parents*, we follow the adventures of one Greg Focker  (if you think that name is hilarious, you're in luck -- it's uttered about 64 times in this movie), who falls in love with the daughter of a former CIA operative  (Robert De Niro)  who's retired in the suburbs.  Marriage is in the air, and so Focker  (Ben Stiller)  goes with his lady-love to her home to Meet The Parents.  As might be expected, things don't go very smoothly.The movie has a paucity of ideas.  The only good idea seems to be the clash between De Niro's macho CIA agent and his future son-in-law, who finds himself compelled to invent stories about himself due to rabid insecurity.  Curiously, the  &quot;female&quot;  angle fades into irrelevance in the midst of all this  &quot;anti&quot;-male-bonding.  For instance, I couldn't tell you the name of the actress who plays Stiller's love-interest -- and rightly so, for attention is scarcely paid to her.  And Blythe Danner, who plays De Niro's wife, is encumbered with a June Cleaver cartoon rather than a fully realized character.  The male-female relationships, particularly De Niro's and Danner's, might have been interesting  (what's it like to be MARRIED to the CIA?), but such a notion was obviously too difficult for the screenwriters to pursue.  Instead, we get relentless father-in-law jokes, and over-the-top ones at that.  It's as if Focker's prospective marriage is merely a set-up to showcase the  (admittedly)  comic mileage gotten from Robert De Niro, with his 30-odd years of tough-guy baggage accompanying him, Versus Ben Stiller, the weasely Gen-X icon.Thankfully, De Niro and Stiller do a heck of a job, easily shouldering the film's burden.  *Meet The Parents*  features two very funny performances from a pair of actors at the top of their game . . . but there's very little else to recommend this movie.",2,Trite.,979084800,"01 10, 2001",2001,1862,"['Parents*', 'follow', 'adventures', 'one', 'Greg', 'Focker', 'think', 'name', 'hilarious', ""'re"", 'luck', 'uttered', '64', 'times', 'movie', 'who', 'love', 'daughter', 'former', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'who', 'retired', 'suburbs', 'Marriage', 'air', 'so', 'Focker', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'lady-love', 'home', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'very', 'smoothly.The', 'movie', 'paucity', 'ideas', 'only', 'good', 'idea', 'be', 'clash', 'De', 'Niro', 'macho', 'CIA', 'agent', 'future', 'son-in-law', 'who', 'compelled', 'invent', 'stories', 'due', 'rabid', 'insecurity', 'Curiously', 'quot', 'female', 'quot', 'fades', 'irrelevance', 'midst', 'quot', 'quot', '-male-bonding', 'instance', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'name', 'actress', 'who', 'Stiller', 'love-interest', 'rightly', 'so', 'attention', 'scarcely', 'paid', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'who', 'De', 'Niro', 'wife', 'encumbered', 'June', 'Cleaver', 'cartoon', 'rather', 'fully', 'realized', 'character', 'male-female', 'relationships', 'particularly', 'De', 'Niro', 'Danner', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'what', 'be', 'MARRIED', 'CIA', 'notion', 'was', 'obviously', 'too', 'difficult', 'screenwriters', 'pursue', 'Instead', 'get', 'relentless', 'father-in-law', 'jokes', 'over-the-top', 'ones', 'Focker', 'prospective', 'marriage', 'merely', 'set-up', 'showcase', 'admittedly', 'comic', 'mileage', 'gotten', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', '30-odd', 'years', 'tough-guy', 'baggage', 'accompanying', 'Versus', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'weasely', 'Gen-X', 'icon.Thankfully', 'De', 'Niro', 'Stiller', 'do', 'heck', 'job', 'easily', 'shouldering', 'film', 'burden', '*Meet', 'Parents*', 'two', 'very', 'funny', 'performances', 'pair', 'actors', 'top', 'game', 'very', 'little', 'else', 'recommend', 'movie']",N/A

To boot, her father is a CIA agent, so of course he can see right through his shinanagins (did I spell that right???).

His work in this movie as an overprotective, paranoid father who is also a CIA operative is very good.  Unfortunately, the film suffers from too many scenes that are just plain mean-spirited.  It seems that the cruelty is forced, the run-ins between DeNiro and Stiller are telegraphed, and the change in DeNiro's character at the end is not believable.  I know this is a comedy, but the rules for consistent behavior should still apply.You could understand a father being a little concerned about his bright, beautiful daughter being in love with a guy who, to him, just doesn't measure up.  But to see him and his friends be so openly cruel to the guy is not really fun to watch.  If the characters were a bit more odd (versus stereotyped) it might have worked.There are bright moments - Blyther Danner as DeNiro's wife gives just the right amount of &quot;I love him, but I'm also a little scared of him&quot; attitude to her role.  And Owen Wilson, as the ex-boyfriend of DeNiro's daughter is wonderful to watch, as usual.The DVD is fine in terms of audio and video, and the extras make the package a good value.

530074,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B00003CXO0,"Maine Writer ""David""","[1, 1]","There are funny moments in Meet the Parents. Owen Wilson, who perhaps has the best performance of the lot, plays the perfect ex-fiance to Ben Stiller's love interest. The only thing he hasn't done is cure the world of all known diseases--but I'm sure he's working on it. There is one scene where he mentions, as an aside, that he carved this ornate altar out of a single block of wood. The delivery of that line is perfect.The movie's flaws are several fold. First, it has trouble landing on being funny or just plain creepy. Part of the problem is Robert DeNiro. A terrific actor, he just doesn't pull off his role. His character just creepy, angry, and offensive, but only marginally humorous. For a movie that shoots for laughs, that's a big problem. In addition, it is almost impossible to like Ben Stiller's character. He is a nicotine addicted, shallow, and deceitful creep. You end up hoping that DeNiro finds some way to end his pitiful existence. Without a main character you can root for, this movie lacks a central core to pull of its ""decent guy finds himself in a nuthouse"" premise.The ending where Stiller and his fiance get back together is, perhaps, is the worst part. It is cliche and not at all credible.  I must, however, separate this from the last moments of the film where Stiller goes into a diatribe without knowing he is being filmed.  That may be the best moment in the film.I gave this movie three stars, rather than just two, because I didn't regret watching it--it had its moments--and I had to leave room for the dregs like Stargate and Independence day at the bottom pegs of the scale.Rent if you want; but don't buy.",3,"Some high points, but few and far between",1019692800,"04 25, 2002",2002,1648,"['are', 'funny', 'moments', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'who', 'perhaps', 'best', 'performance', 'lot', 'perfect', 'ex-fiance', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'love', 'interest', 'only', 'thing', ""n't"", 'done', 'cure', 'world', 'known', 'diseases', ""'m"", 'sure', 'working', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'aside', 'carved', 'ornate', 'single', 'block', 'wood', 'delivery', 'line', 'perfect.The', 'movie', 'flaws', 'are', 'several', 'fold', 'First', 'trouble', 'landing', 'being', 'funny', 'just', 'plain', 'creepy', 'Part', 'problem', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'A', 'terrific', 'actor', 'just', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'role', 'character', 'just', 'creepy', 'angry', 'offensive', 'only', 'marginally', 'humorous', 'movie', 'laughs', 'big', 'problem', 'addition', 'almost', 'impossible', 'like', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'character', 'nicotine', 'addicted', 'shallow', 'deceitful', 'creep', 'end', 'up', 'hoping', 'DeNiro', 'way', 'end', 'pitiful', 'existence', 'main', 'character', 'can', 'root', 'movie', 'central', 'core', 'pull', 'decent', 'guy', 'nuthouse', 'premise.The', 'ending', 'where', 'Stiller', 'fiance', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'part', 'cliche', 'not', 'credible', 'must', 'however', 'separate', 'last', 'moments', 'film', 'where', 'Stiller', 'diatribe', 'knowing', 'being', 'filmed', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'moment', 'film.I', 'gave', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'rather', 'just', 'two', 'did', ""n't"", 'regret', 'watching', 'had', 'moments', 'had', 'leave', 'room', 'dregs', 'Stargate', 'Independence', 'day', 'bottom', 'pegs', 'scale.Rent', 'want', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy']",N/A

530080,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXO0,Matthew Horner,"[1, 3]","Meet the Parents is, for me, happy confirmation that Hollywood can still make a terrific comedy that has broad appeal. I wish this would happen more often. Today much of the focus is on audiences between twelve and twenty-five years old. There is no denying that this is the age group that goes to the movies the most, and catering to it is appropriate. Still, the huge hits are almost always ones like Titanic and The Sixth Sense whose appeal is to a much broader age range. This is why Meet the Parents has been so successful. There are things in it a twelve-year old can enjoy, but it is equally entertaining to someone who is sixty.Greg [Ben Stiller] is a highly competent nurse who is head-over-heels in love with Pam Burnes [Teri Polo], a school teacher. He sets up an elaborate marriage proposal for her, but in the middle of it, she not only announces that her sister is engaged, but also exclaims that she is thrilled that her sibling's fiance asked her father's permission first. Greg, who is as insecure as they come, decides not to propose just yet. He will please Pam and her family by waiting to talk to dear old Dad. The opportunity comes when the couple goes from Chicago to New York to attend the sister's wedding.Have you ever been in a situation where nothing you do or say works? That's what Greg encounters when he finally meets the parents. Mother Dina [Blythe Danner] is amiable enough, but father Jack [Robert DeNiro] is, to say the least, a challenge. It isn't that he is heartless or mean. It's that he is ferociously protective of his family, especially of his favorite, Pam. You know the type. No man has ever been good enough for his little Pammy. Making Jack even more formidable is his former profession. He's a retired CIA agent. Ferreting out the truth was his job. The house if full of spy cams, and Jack even owns his own polygraph machine. He just can't let go of these toys or of the spy mentality Then there is the family cat. It's a gorgeous Himalayan that is Jack's favorite pet of all time. Jack says it can never go out side because it has no survival skills. This is a comedy, and, of course, someone lets the cat out. You can guess who manages to do that. And in this comedy of disasters, this is only a small part of Greg's problems.Robert DeNiro, who has shown himself to be a natural in comedies lately, and Ben Stiller, always good for a lot of laughs, play off each other as if they have been a comedy team for years. Blythe Danner is amusing as Mom, and Teri Polo is appropriately sweet and lovable as Pam. Almost stealing the movie is Owen Wilson as Kevin, as Pam's flamboyant, millionaire ex-fiance. Director Jay Roach originally envisioned Kevin as a jock type, but Wilson put his own spin on the character, as he always does. The results are hysterically funny.

This hilarious comedy benefits from Stiller's deadpan delivery and his unfortunate weekend visit with his girlfriend's parents.  Stiller benefits from a clever, if somewhat preposterous, script, and from a supporting cast that is top notch.  Robert DeNiro as Jack Burns, ex-CIA agent, fills the bill nicely as Papa, and his interrogation of a prospective son-in-law is uproarious, especially when he conveniently talks Stiller into a polygraph test.  Blythe Danner is glorious as Mama Burns, providing a Gracie Burns type counterpoint to DeNiro's George.  Elegant and graceful, she still manages to come off with some deadpan deliveries that are sparkling.  Teri Polo is very good as Pam, Stiller's intended.  She has a smoothness and vulnerability that makes her character sympathetic.  James Rebhorn and Owen Wilson round out the cast, and director Jay Roach keeps the comedy coming.

Of course, it's well-intentioned bull, but it's bull nonetheless, and his father-in-law to be (Robert DeNiro) sees right through it.Of course, it's easier to be yourself when your future dad-in-law isn't an ex-CIA operative who hooks you up to a lie detector and asks if you've ever watched a porn flick (the needle flickers intently...). It's also a lot easier to win your new father-in-law's affection when the guy doesn't idolize your fiancee's last boyfriend, a self-made yuppie, born-again Christian, and highly skilled woodworker.All Greg has to sell is that he's a Jewish kid from a farm where they milked cats, and he's a male nurse to boot.And, of course, not every poor guy who goes to meet his future in-laws ends up flooding their lawn with septic waste, setting their back yard on fire, ruining a wedding, losing the family cat, and having someone else's suitcase - complete with bondage gear - delivered to the family home.The nice thing about &quot;Meet the Parents,&quot; though, is that all these abuses heaped on Greg are never anything but good-natured; if this film's tone had veered even slightly towards cruelty, it simply wouldn't have worked.Stiller does a great job keeping Greg as a likeable BS artist, not a con artist, and De Niro is terrific as usual as every guy's nightmare father in law. The writing is sharp, and the filmmakers are smart enough to know that the conflict will never go beyond being a good-natured series of misadventures and misunderstandings.We know Greg is a nice guy who deserves the girl, and her family's respect, but it's just a matter of enduring his pain until his luck turns and his new family begins to accept him.Come to think of it, when you leave out spray painting cats' tails, isn't that the way it works in most families?",4,VERY funny and smart film...,1007078400,"11 30, 2001",2001,2426,"['anyone', 'who', 'been', 'faced', 'unique', 'experience', 'having', 'ask', 'parents', 'intended', 'hand', 'marriage', 'did', 'dear', 'reader', ""'ll"", 'know', 'essential', 'conflict', 'poor', 'Greg', 'Focker', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'central', 'character', 'quot', 'Meet', 'Parents.', 'quot', 'Do', 'just', 'overcome', 'nervousness', 'substantial', 'let', 'tell', 'be', 'do', 'make', 'out', 'be', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'sensitive', 'side', 'Greg', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'insecure', 'be', 'intended', 'fiancee', 'parents', 'answer', 'weave', 'tapestry', 'bull', 'including', 'proclamation', 'can', 'milk', 'cat', 'course', 'well-intentioned', 'bull', 'bull', 'nonetheless', 'father-in-law', 'be', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'right', 'it.Of', 'course', 'easier', 'be', 'when', 'future', 'dad-in-law', ""n't"", 'ex-CIA', 'operative', 'who', 'up', 'lie', 'detector', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'porn', 'flick', 'needle', 'flickers', 'intently', 'also', 'lot', 'easier', 'win', 'new', 'father-in-law', 'affection', 'when', 'guy', ""n't"", 'idolize', 'fiancee', 'last', 'boyfriend', 'self-made', 'yuppie', 'born-again', 'Christian', 'highly', 'skilled', 'woodworker.All', 'Greg', 'sell', 'Jewish', 'kid', 'farm', 'where', 'milked', 'cats', 'male', 'nurse', 'boot.And', 'course', 'not', 'poor', 'guy', 'who', 'meet', 'future', 'in-laws', 'up', 'flooding', 'lawn', 'septic', 'waste', 'setting', 'back', 'yard', 'fire', 'ruining', 'wedding', 'losing', 'family', 'cat', 'having', 'someone', 'else', 'suitcase', 'complete', 'bondage', 'gear', 'delivered', 'family', 'home.The', 'nice', 'thing', 'quot', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'quot', 'abuses', 'heaped', 'Greg', 'are', 'never', 'anything', 'good-natured', 'film', 'tone', 'had', 'veered', 'even', 'slightly', 'towards', 'cruelty', 'simply', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked.Stiller', 'great', 'job', 'keeping', 'Greg', 'likeable', 'BS', 'artist', 'not', 'con', 'artist', 'De', 'Niro', 'terrific', 'as', 'usual', 'guy', 'nightmare', 'father', 'law', 'writing', 'sharp', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'conflict', 'will', 'never', 'go', 'being', 'good-natured', 'series', 'misadventures', 'misunderstandings.We', 'know', 'Greg', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'girl', 'family', 'respect', 'just', 'matter', 'enduring', 'pain', 'luck', 'turns', 'new', 'family', 'accept', 'him.Come', 'think', 'when', 'leave', 'out', 'spray', 'painting', 'cats', 'tails', ""n't"", 'way', 'most', 'families']",N/A

This is perhaps Stiller's funniest movie, though definitely among his best.Ben Stiller plays the male nurse Greg Focker, who travels with his girlfriend Pam, (Teri Polo), to meet her parents. Robert DeNiro plays Jack Byrnes, an overly protective, paranoid ex-CIA agent with an obsession for his cat and the ""circle of trust"". Owen Wilson plays his usually soft-spoken, almost floppish, ex-boyfriend of Pam.Much like in ""Meet the Fockers"", Greg's name and his profession are exploited for jokes endlessly. However, over and above this, the movie has plenty of material to keep viewers in fits and agonising spasms of laughter. Greg's attempts to win over Pam's parents are hilarious, as well as the stories he spins to try and impress. I still get a laugh out of the cat milking story and Jack's response, ""Could you milk me, Greg? I have nipples.""Apart from the spoken humour, there is also a lot of the more visual humour, which just increases the appeal of the movie to a wider audience. Greg's antics are amazing and Stiller is amazing in this role.I laughed so hard during this movie, and enjoyed it immensely on all occassions that I have seen it.

As you would imagine, this being a romantic comedy, everything that could go wrong DOES, only 10X worse!!!THE STORY:Greg wants to marry Pam and is ready to ask her the big one but fate intervenes and Greg realizes to make the best impression he'll first need to meet Pam's parents and get her father's permission first.  Pam and Greg travel home for her sister's wedding and Greg tries his VERY best to make a good impression on Pam's dad Jack (the legendary Robert DeNiro!!!).  Things immediately go from bad to worse as it is revealed that Jack is actually a former CIA operative and Greg continually digs himself into a TON of bad spots that would surely make you think he'll NEVER make it into the family - and that's too bad because he's an overall pretty nice guy!!!THE COOL THINGS:This movie's actually the PERFECT comedy of errors and Greg's life just continually goes from bad to worse.  The amazingly horrible situations he gets into are hilarious and at the same time really pathetic.  You'll definitely feel for his character.The performances turned in by the two male leads, Stiller and DeNiro are just amazing.

The basic plot is very simple : Ben Stiller's character's madly in love with his girlfriend, and wants to marry her. However, before he can propose, she takes him for a weekend at her parents' place - and then the fun begins.His prospective father-in-law, played by Robert De Niro, is very fond of his daughter &amp; openly disapproving, if not exactly hostile, towards this stranger who's won her heart. He also seems to have a secret up his sleeve - perhaps there is more to him than meets the eye ?The rest of the movie is a series of mishaps and encounters between the protagonists, till things finally fall into place.Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro are perfect foils for each other - which is what makes this film work. Stiller is good at playing your average guy who's slightly goofy, but essentially sincere &amp; endearing, whereas Robert De Niro's good at just about everything, and here he does some great deadpan comedy. The support cast is ok - they don't have much to do.The film has several laugh-out-aloud moments, and neglegibly few corny jokes. Towards the end, some unbelievable things do happen, but nobody said this was a classic or anything - it's just an enjoyable comedy, nothing more, nothing less.I'd say this is a good choice for renting - if you find it funny enough, it may become a good buy as well.",4,Among the better recent comedies,999993600,"09 9, 2001",2001,1414,"['pretty', 'funny', 'film', 'can', 'keep', 'one', 'attention', 'most', 'duration', 'basic', 'plot', 'very', 'simple', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'character', 'madly', 'love', 'girlfriend', 'marry', 'However', 'can', 'propose', 'weekend', 'parents', 'place', 'then', 'fun', 'begins.His', 'prospective', 'father-in-law', 'played', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'very', 'fond', 'daughter', 'amp', 'openly', 'disapproving', 'not', 'exactly', 'hostile', 'towards', 'stranger', 'who', 'won', 'heart', 'also', 'have', 'secret', 'up', 'sleeve', 'perhaps', 'more', 'eye', 'rest', 'movie', 'series', 'mishaps', 'encounters', 'protagonists', 'till', 'things', 'finally', 'fall', 'place.Ben', 'Stiller', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'are', 'perfect', 'foils', 'other', 'what', 'film', 'work', 'Stiller', 'good', 'playing', 'average', 'guy', 'who', 'slightly', 'goofy', 'essentially', 'sincere', 'amp', 'endearing', 'whereas', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'good', 'just', 'everything', 'here', 'great', 'deadpan', 'comedy', 'support', 'cast', 'ok', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do.The', 'film', 'several', 'laugh-out-aloud', 'moments', 'neglegibly', 'few', 'corny', 'jokes', 'end', 'unbelievable', 'things', 'do', 'happen', 'nobody', 'said', 'was', 'classic', 'anything', 'just', 'enjoyable', 'comedy', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'good', 'choice', 'renting', 'find', 'funny', 'enough', 'may', 'become', 'good', 'buy', 'well']",N/A

But when he decides to ask for her hand in marriage, he decides to ask permission from her father, Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro). So when Pam goes back home to attend the wedding of her sister, Greg decides to accompany her to meet Jack. Unfortunately for him, Jack is an ex-CIA agent, a 'human lie detector'. When Greg tries to impress him and doesn't tell the truth, his lies get him deeper and deeper in trouble. Before he knows it, his life is turned upside down as he tries to cover up lie after lie.I had heard ""Meet the Parents"" was very hilarious but somehow I couldn't seem to enjoy the film that much. Here are the good and bad points of the film and why I give ""Meet the Parents"" three stars.First the acting done by Robert De Niro must be mentioned (check out his reading of the poem he wrote for his deceased mother :). He's the perfect ex-CIA agent you would imagine in your head. His part in the film should make the title change to ""Meet My Father"" or something like that. Ben Stiller is also impressive as the character of Greg Focker. The beginning and the end of the movie I was surprised how much emotion he portrayed and could see his love for Pam. But during the middle of the film, I was a bit discouraged from liking his character. Oh, and since this is a Ben Stiller movie, you probably already know that Owen Wilson gets a small role as Kevin Rawley, Pam's ex-fiance. I wish we could have seen more of him, his comedic talent and sarcastic wit wasn't really put to work.The story just didn't seem to impress me. The beginning as I said seemed to go well but as the story went along, it went in my opinion downhill. I just couldn't buy how much trouble the character of Greg Focker could get into. In fact, this movie very much reminds me of Steve Martin's ""Father of the Bride"", which I think I loved more.The movie is definitely rated PG-13 for sexual content and humor. ""Meet the Parents"" had it's very funny moments but some of the jokes just weren't funny.So, maybe it's just me but this movie just didn't seem to click with me.

Well... scratch that, I do know: appealing to a demographic.  To put it mildly, if you are over 40, you might find this movie amusing.  If seeing Robert Deniro hang around his suburban home in a yuppie cardigan with his airhead wife, incessantly yapping about inane topics, and preening over his beloved pet cat makes you smile, then maybe this movie hits close enough to home for you to see a reflection.Honestly, I laughed ONCE during this whole flick (two words: &quot;kitty litter&quot;) but that was IT.

530116,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXO0,Reviewer,"[5, 7]","How do you make a good first impression on and win over your prospective father-in-law on the very weekend you intend to ask for his first-born daughter's hand in marriage?  A tricky, touchy, very delicate and serious situation that must be faced and addressed by a young man in ""Meet The Parents,"" a hilarious comedy directed by Jay Roach and starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller.  Greg (Stiller) is in love; he knows Pam (Teri Polo) is the one he wants to spend the rest of his life with, and is ready to propose.  But certain circumstances clue him in to the fact that he should meet her parents first, approach her father, Jack (De Niro), and make the formal request, thereby extending him the respect he has come to understand Jack demands.  Plans are made, and the weekend begins with the flight from Chicago to New York.  And when a slight problem arises even before they board their plane, Greg should have seen it as an omen, because after that, absolutely nothing seems to go as planned. He finds Pam's mom, Dina (Blythe Danner), fairly accessible, but Jack turns out to be quite the formidable opponent, and from the minute they meet it becomes one long dance and spar of witticisms and revelations that make this one weekend Greg (and the audience) will never forget.  What makes this movie so funny (and this IS one funny movie) is that the humor is character driven, situational and all very real; the laughs (and there are plenty) are all earned and are derived from inherently comical events and circumstances.  The ongoing banter between Greg and Jack is clever, the dialogue is superb and delivered with such sly and subtle shadings that it rings true at every turn.  And De Niro and Stiller play off of one another so perfectly and with such impeccable timing that it's like watching art come to life.  Stiller is a master at playing comedy dead-pan straight, and De Niro proves to be his equal here.  They never go after cheap laughs, and what little broad humor Roach employs evolves directly from the story and is never gratuitous or overdone; Roach and his cast let it all flow naturally and play it with a seriousness that makes it all the more hilarious.  You can literally feel Greg's pain and discomfort as he tries in vain to stand tall and impress this intimidating figure of a man he hopes will soon be his own father-in-law.  And De Niro makes Jack everything a suitor dreads in a prospective in-law; he doesn't merely scratch the surface of this character, but goes deep to make him a multi-layered personality, enigmatic and hard to read.  You know instinctively that there's more to this guy than meets the eye, and given the fact that nobody is good enough in his eyes for his little girl, he is a nightmare waiting for any and all ""Gregs"" that may come a-calling.  Polo is charming as Pam; she's charismatic, has great screen presence and a winning personality that makes her character likable and totally believable.  In a supporting role, Owen Wilson gives a stand-out performance as Pam's ex-boyfriend, Kevin; he so wryly underplays him, and what he does contrasts so well with what De Niro and Stiller are doing that it makes him one of the most memorable characters in the film.  Rounding out the excellent supporting cast are Nicole DeHuff (Debbie), Jon Abrahams (Denny), James Rebhorn (Larry) and Phyllis George (Linda).  With ""Meet The Parents,"" Roach leaves no doubt as to what he can do with a comedy; this film is filled with truly funny, memorable scenes and has an endless number of quotable lines, the best of which belongs to Jack (spoken to Greg ):  ""If I find that you are trying to corrupt my first born child, I will bring you down, baby, I will bring you down to Chinatown-""  In the final analysis, it's all a lot of fun, and there are many things here with which many viewers will readily identify.

Put another way, there's laughs and chuckles here for all tastes.The story starts off fairly quickly, establishing that Greg Focker (Stiller) wants to marry his girlfriend, Pam (Polo), and that to do that, he has to get permission first. The weekend starts slowly, with her parents seeming just a little quirky at first, until things get worse and worse for Greg. Then, towards the end, the unexpected happens, and the film flexes back again, with everything falling in its place, subplots revolved, and the whole film feels like a complete picture.The comedy varies between verbal sparring between Stiller and De Niro, and physical comedy (this is all Stiller). Playing over-protective father Jack Byrnes, De Niro hits his comedic stride. You might expect him to play Jack as stereotypically gruff or scary, but what we get instead is a guy who is eternally smiling, which gives him a friendly exterior, while underneath, the gears are turning, turning. Ben Stiller plays the same sort of earnest &quot;guy in love&quot; that worked for him in There's Something About Mary. In other words, he alternates between nervous and heartfelt (and nervous). His jumpiness is the very thing that makes De Niro's character so effective; we see Jack through Greg's eyes. Blythe Danner and Teri Polo are both beautiful and charming, but this movie is mostly about the boys. Playing upon a common social setting of much nervousness (boy seeks approval and permission), this is a winning comedy that is sure to do quite well this fall. The PG-13 rating comes partly because much of the &quot;language humor&quot; is from the use of Greg's name, &quot;Focker&quot; (and another word that I won't spoil)... it treads a thin profanity line, but the script milks it for all its worth. Maybe that joke is played a little thin (as is a running drug joke as well), but overall, the laughs are consistent, and the story is sweet and even old-fashioned in its way (asking permission to get married?

530123,A24VGKPXCMFY9Z,B00003CXO0,"Robert E Wilson ""robewil""","[3, 4]","This could have and should have been a much better movie.  The premise is that Greg Focker, played by Ben Stiller, is to meet his potential fiance's parents for the first time.  The father, Jack Byrnes played by Robert DeNiro, is overly suspicious and overly protective of his daughter, not to mention, his cat.  Greg senses this right away and tries throughout most of the rest of the movie to impress his potential future father in law.  Of course, everything Greg does and says does exactly the opposite so by the end of the film, Jack is convinced that Greg is conniving and dishonest and completely unsuitable for his daughter.We, the audience are supposed to feel bad for Greg because he is supposedly, a good hearted person.  The problem is, he isn't and he really deserves to be excommunicated from this family.  The script should have had the various ""accidents"" that happen in the movie be just that, accidents so we would sympathize with Greg's plight.  Instead, at least most of these accidents occurred because Greg actually is dishonest and a person of low moral character.  For example, he spray paints the tail of a cat found in a shelter to pass him off as Jack's real cat.  Why are we supposed to believe that a person who would do this is a good guy simply because he is only doing it because he feels pressured by Jack?  I don't buy it.  Especially when he wasn't up front about losing the original cat in the first place which happened because he wanted to smoke a cigarette even though he told Jack and his wife he doesn't smoke.  See what I mean?  He weaves a huge web of deceit, yet at the end, all is forgiven.There are some fairly humerous parts in this movie but I really couldn't enjoy it because I just could not get myself to like the main character.",2,Not so good,1015545600,"03 8, 2002",2002,1780,"['could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'premise', 'Greg', 'Focker', 'played', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'meet', 'potential', 'fiance', 'parents', 'first', 'time', 'father', 'Jack', 'Byrnes', 'played', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'overly', 'suspicious', 'overly', 'protective', 'daughter', 'not', 'mention', 'cat', 'Greg', 'right', 'away', 'tries', 'most', 'rest', 'movie', 'impress', 'potential', 'future', 'father', 'law', 'course', 'everything', 'Greg', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'so', 'end', 'film', 'Jack', 'convinced', 'Greg', 'conniving', 'dishonest', 'completely', 'unsuitable', 'daughter.We', 'audience', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'bad', 'Greg', 'supposedly', 'good', 'hearted', 'person', 'problem', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'excommunicated', 'family', 'script', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'various', 'accidents', 'happen', 'movie', 'be', 'just', 'accidents', 'would', 'sympathize', 'Greg', 'plight', 'Instead', 'least', 'most', 'accidents', 'occurred', 'Greg', 'actually', 'dishonest', 'person', 'low', 'moral', 'character', 'example', 'tail', 'cat', 'found', 'shelter', 'pass', 'off', 'Jack', 'real', 'cat', 'Why', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'do', 'good', 'guy', 'simply', 'only', 'doing', 'pressured', 'Jack', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Especially', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'front', 'losing', 'original', 'cat', 'first', 'place', 'happened', 'wanted', 'smoke', 'cigarette', 'even', 'told', 'Jack', 'wife', ""n't"", 'smoke', 'See', 'what', 'mean', 'huge', 'web', 'deceit', 'yet', 'end', 'are', 'fairly', 'humerous', 'parts', 'movie', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'like', 'main', 'character']",N/A
530124,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXO0,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","Funny as well as touching, ""Meet the Parents"" blazes forth as one of the outstanding comedies of recent years.Co-writers Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke, along with director Jay Roach, have managed to make a film that is often laugh-out-loud hilarious without ever becoming overbearing or obnoxious, the style of choice for far too many other comedies made in this day and age.  Although the film overflows with madcap situations and even outright slapstick at times, these comic elements are always tethered to the reality of the premise and to the emotional states of the characters involved.The foundation for any great comedy must, first and foremost, be its ability to connect with its audience on a personal level.  ""Meet the Parents"" does so from the very start by tapping into the universal dilemma we all face at one time or another of desperately trying to make a good impression on someone we feel holds nothing less than the fate of our lives in their own two hands.  For some of us this person might come in the form a boss or a potential employer or, as in poor Greg Focker's case, those most dreaded figures of all - the prospective in-laws.  The comedy arises from seeing the chain of ever more preposterous events and circumstances that come along to sabotage his efforts.  Greg is a goodhearted, well-meaning nebbish who wants nothing more out of life than to marry Pam, the girl he loves.  First, however, he must climb over the rather formidable barrier of her eccentric father, Jack Byrnes, played to perfection by Robert De Niro, who certainly has his own offbeat way of looking at the world.The triumph of this film is that it never overdoes anything.  The people in Pam's family and in their coterie of friends are all twisted it's true, but twisted in sly, subtle ways that knock both Greg and us slightly off our balance.  Like Greg, we never quite know where these people are coming from and this greatly enhances the comedic quality of the film.  Tone is everything in comedy and here the tone is just right.  Byrnes can seem at one moment to be a reasonable loving father, then turn immediately around and make the most unbalanced comments about the most trivial matters.  Even when the movie is at its most outrageous in terms of plot complications and slapstick, it never veers off the scale into incredibility.  Part of the reason is that we feel so much empathy for Greg, the best Everyman character I have seen in a movie in a long time.  Ben Stiller gives a beautifully understated comic performance in the main role.  Greg's completely understandable feelings of nervousness, intimidation and growing frustration help to keep the film anchored in reality, even as the story threatens to spiral off into undisciplined absurdity.  Luckily, the filmmakers never let this happen.  They are also blessed with the genius of Mr. De Niro, who never makes a false move as the seemingly crazy ex-CIA agent who may or may not be harboring a few secrets of his own. Above all, De Niro never lets us bank on the extent of his character's eccentricity, which brilliantly enhances this ""weekend from hell"" scenario.

That, and the number of things which happen to him -- he hits Pam's sister in the nose with a volleyball, he sets their wedding gazebo on fire, he loses Jinx (the cat), tries to replace Jinx with a look-alike, he backs-up the septic system creating quite a mess in the backyard, et al.  It almost buckles under its own weight.Yet, despite these things, it's still funny.  I think what keeps it afloat is the acting.  Stiller is perfectly set as the hapless fall-guy Focker.  DeNiro does very well playing the suspicious father / former CIA detective.  Wilson does pretty well as the &quot;perfect&quot; ex-boyfriend, although they probably could've gotten someone even better.  And Polo is well set as the beautiful girlfriend.

Greg gets into every screwup imaginable throughout this film and everybody seems to be turning against him.The actors are great. First of all, you have two acting greats in this film. Ben Stiller and Al Pacino are very well known actors and a third actor, while not known as much of Al and Ben, is Owen Wilson.

Even though this movie did not make a lick of sense, Stiller still made it worthwhile and hilarious as hell.  Maybe it's my imagination, but Stiller seems to be developing a meek, ineffectual, Woody Allen-ish type character.  I've seen this character in three films now, including 'There's Something About Mary' and 'Mystery Men'.  This character is most comical in stories in which they find themselves in awkward and uncomfortable social situations.  I'm about the biggest fan in the world of the Woodman but I think a squirming Ben Stiller is funnier than a squirming Woody Allen.  And just as he proved in last year's 'Analyze This', Robert DeNiro, with his dead-serious countenance and legendary past screen personas, makes the perfect straight man.  The laugh to groan ratio takes a plummet in the last 20 minutes of the film, which begs the question of why Hollywood still insists on making sappy and mawkish and completely contrived &quot;happy endings&quot;.

I believe Mr. Stiller should stop making films for a while and start thinking about his career. Otherwise he is on his way to becoming a Jerry Lewis of sorts. Not that being Jerry Lewis is bad, but look at Edward Norton with which he shares starring roles in &quot;Keeping the Faith&quot;. Edward Norton can play in any movie from Fight Club to American History X, whereas Ben Stiller has himself cornered into copycat comedy roles.Apart from my views on Stiller, this is a good movie where at some point there are so many disasters taking place around Focker that you start to get an uneasy feeling about the whole thing. And of course when everything is resolved at the end (as it should) you give out the breath that you had been holding. It really gets disturbing at some points (the cat, the fire, the big wedding suprise...).As ever, the great De Niro is a formidable character. This man is so good he commands the movie. His presence is what makes this film attractive. Others just move in and out of scenes. If it weren't for the disasters he creates, even Stiller would hardly be noticed beside Robert De Niro.All in all, if you like Stiller buy it. If you like De Niro, buy it.

He feels a little edgey about his social status and has a difficult time when he meets the parents of his fiance. He tries to be pleasant but his attempts to be polite are seen as evasion or lying. He limps along from disaster to disaster seeming more and more absurd till a rather artificial happy ending.Ben Stiller now must be close to Americas premier comic actor. Robert De Nero is not normally known for his comic strengths but his skills as an actor means that he is good in his part. Terri Polo as Stiller's girlfriend is also good, looking attractive but not like a model, like  a real person.The basic problem with the film is that it is not very funny. A few of the scences are very good, but the pace of the film is slow and most of the jokes are drawn out and the plot density is not very dense. In most succesful comedies there are usually a number of plot turns occuring at any one time so that jokes are unexpected and pile on top of each other. In this film the set up scenes crank along slowly so that you can see each joke coming a mile off and they have limited impact.The other problem is that the Stiller character is not that likeable. The fact that his fiance wants him at the end is not that rational and one thinks that she must have slept through a lot of the previous action.

Granted that many of the laughs can be seen setting up a mile before they arrive. Still, that doesn't make them any less funny. Ben Stiller is a great comic actor and has the poor schmuck routine down perfectly. However, Stiller doesn't steal the show here. He shares center stage with Robert DeNiro. DeNiro isn't known for his comic abilities, but if he can make a few more great comedies like this, he may become known as a great comic genius.Other than a few swear words and a little sexual innuendo, the movie remains closer to a PG family flick of the PG-13 rating, rather than the more racier, near R-rating side of the 13. It's a film that families with children older than 10 can enjoy together. The movie reminded me of and is closer in style to older comedies that stars such as Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant, and Dick Van Dyke used to make; rather than the typical gross-out picture fests that is so typical nowadays.The movie succeeds because it's premise is derived from the very real fears of life. What groom to be doesn't fear meeting his father-in law for the first time? Then when finally meeting him find out that the man not only doesn't like you, but is an ex-CIA agent who is watching every move you make with secretly placed video cameras and is so stubborn that he can't see beyond his own selfish pride how much his daughter is in love.

Here you don't get even one, and that's a big curse to a lot of this-past-year hit comedies I saw (except &quot;Chicken Run&quot;).It starts with a jinx-happy average joe (Ben Stiller) named Greg Fawker who wants to marry a school teacher (Jay Roach). Before she does, though, she has to make sure it's alright with her parents. It passes with her mom, but her dad (Robert De Niro), a paranoid ex-CIA agent, gets a little...too paranoid.Sounds like funny comedy, right?

You ring the doorbell, mother opens, and invites you in. In the living room is the girl. Mother mentions dad will be right in, and positions you in a sofa, as far away from the girl as possible, leaving the seat right next to you.In walks 300 pounds of Dad, who sits down, eyes you from top to bottom, then locks his eyes on yours, and starts a monologue about his daughter being in pristine condition, and him demanding she'd be returned in that very condition, too. He continues about how you are to take things easy.With sweat trinkling down your back, you finally leave with the girl who immediatly makes a comment about over-protective parents followed by a giggle.While I wish this was made up? It is not.When I first learned about 'Meet the Parents', I figured it would be worth a laugh. In the cinema, though? I was experiencing that scene over and over in my head. Except, 300 pounds of dad looked remarkably like Robert De Niro, while my character was being played by Ben Stiller.I found out though, that I had experienced the mild version.Gaylord 'Greg' Focker (Stiller. (what's in a name?)) has steadily been dating Pam Byrnes for a while, and is about to propose to her. Until he finds out her sister is getting married. When he overhears Pam making a comment that Bob (her sister's fiancee) was very smart to seek out Pam's dad's (De Niro) approval first, he decides against asking her right then and there.Greg and Pam head over to her parents' place for the wedding of her sister, with Greg intended on getting on Dad's good side, to see if he can get his blessing. But that's when the trouble starts.Greg's luggage is lost, and a series of misinterpreted comments, little lies by Greg in order to stay on Dad's good side, and some honest mistakes lead to growing tension between Greg and Dad. When Greg finds out that Dad is, in fact, NOT a florist as he was told, but a retired CIA spy interrogator, things start getting REAL ugly.Though Stiller probably was typecast based on his performance in '&quot;here's something about Mary&quot;, his performance doesn't give you a feeling of deja vu. Stiller is exceptional at playing the poor misunderstood, but most of all pity-inflicting guy; someone you can't help but feel sorry for, and yet at the same time laugh so hard about.Drama after drama piles up, and from a rather confident man, the viewer sees Stiller transform into a paranoid and broken man, who is trying SO hard to get on Dad's good side, but unintentionally manages to create situation after situation leading to dad noticably liking him less and less.De Niro is a wonderful 'bad' guy. From the very first moment we meet him, he convinces as the over-protective father, who is a tad skeptical towards Greg, turning more and more suspicious of him as the movie goes along. One can't really blame him. All evidence suggests against Greg, and he's just looking out for his favourite daughter.All in all, the movie is highly entertaining. Nothing is funnier than laughing other people's misery (Proof? America's funniest homevideos. The harder they fall? The harder we laugh), and this movie exploits that fully well. You can't help NOT laughing, while at the very same time you feel so terribly sorry for Stiller.For those interested? I did return the girl in pristine condition, and broke up with her shortly after. One of the reasons was her parents being overly suspicious, and spying on us whenever we had some privat time.

Not only does Ben Stiller give one of his best performances to date, but Robert De Niro really does an outstanding job in this comedy as well.

Just as he is about to propose, he comes to know about Teri's sister's engagement to some doctor - guy who was courteous enough to ask Teri's father before asking her sister! Obviously Ben wants to be in the good books of Teri. As a result, he decides to spend the weekend with Teri's parents. Of course, he screws up the weekend, with the aid of my man - Robert De Nero, who is Teri's father (surprise!) and is, in not in a mood to have a nurse as his son - in - law. A slew of idiosyncrasies exhibited by Ben soon follow, till the movie ends. The end? (Take a guess.)The movie is a war between a nurse (Ben) and an ex - C.I.A. interrogator (De Nero) - the former trying to win the heart of the latter, and the latter finding it hard to accept the former because of a lot of things, such as the former's name, profession, hatred towards cats, and a whole lot of other goofy things, which make up the movie.Ben can be looked upon with pity, considering the things he has to go through, throughout the weekend, but the movie is, by no means, a warm hearted  comedy. So, laugh your heart out on Ben, as he makes a total ass of himself (very seriously), with no sense of pathos. The humor is not merely slapstick and is, in a lot of parts, very subtle. Apart from Ben, falling off the roof of the house, making a fruitless attempt to catch De Nero's pet cat and almost setting the house on fire and making a healthy contribution to overflowing the septic tank (and blaming the cat for doing it, on top of that) the funny bits are well contained within formal conversation between Di Nero & Ben, with a stoic expression on the faces of both which makes the comedy more mordant and funny. The exchange of words between Ben & Robert which appear seething on the surface, is what gives a high to the movie.  Even as Ben breaks up before the flight attendant, towards the end of the movie, while returning home after a terrible weekend, makes us laugh rather than feel sorry for him.The end is as sweet as it can get, with things, somehow patched up between Di Nero and Ben, of course. All is well that ends well....",4,fantastic comedy!,1027209600,"07 21, 2002",2002,2177,"['plot', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'nurse', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'Just', 'propose', 'know', 'Teri', 'sister', 'engagement', 'doctor', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'courteous', 'enough', 'ask', 'Teri', 'father', 'asking', 'sister', 'Obviously', 'Ben', 'be', 'good', 'books', 'Teri', 'result', 'spend', 'weekend', 'Teri', 'parents', 'course', 'up', 'weekend', 'aid', 'man', 'Robert', 'De', 'Nero', 'who', 'Teri', 'father', 'surprise', 'not', 'mood', 'have', 'nurse', 'son', 'law', 'slew', 'idiosyncrasies', 'exhibited', 'Ben', 'soon', 'follow', 'till', 'movie', 'end', 'Take', 'guess', 'movie', 'war', 'nurse', 'Ben', 'ex', 'C.I.A', 'interrogator', 'De', 'Nero', 'former', 'trying', 'win', 'heart', 'latter', 'latter', 'finding', 'hard', 'accept', 'former', 'lot', 'things', 'such', 'former', 'name', 'profession', 'hatred', 'towards', 'cats', 'whole', 'lot', 'other', 'goofy', 'things', 'make', 'up', 'movie.Ben', 'can', 'be', 'looked', 'pity', 'considering', 'things', 'go', 'weekend', 'movie', 'means', 'warm', 'hearted', 'comedy', 'So', 'heart', 'out', 'Ben', 'total', 'ass', 'very', 'seriously', 'sense', 'pathos', 'humor', 'not', 'merely', 'slapstick', 'lot', 'parts', 'very', 'subtle', 'Apart', 'Ben', 'falling', 'off', 'roof', 'house', 'making', 'fruitless', 'attempt', 'catch', 'De', 'Nero', 'pet', 'cat', 'almost', 'setting', 'house', 'fire', 'making', 'healthy', 'contribution', 'overflowing', 'septic', 'tank', 'blaming', 'cat', 'doing', 'top', 'funny', 'bits', 'are', 'well', 'contained', 'formal', 'conversation', 'Di', 'Nero', 'Ben', 'stoic', 'expression', 'comedy', 'more', 'mordant', 'funny', 'exchange', 'words', 'Ben', 'Robert', 'appear', 'seething', 'surface', 'what', 'high', 'movie', 'Even', 'Ben', 'up', 'flight', 'attendant', 'end', 'movie', 'returning', 'home', 'terrible', 'weekend', 'rather', 'feel', 'sorry', 'him.The', 'end', 'as', 'sweet', 'can', 'get', 'things', 'somehow', 'patched', 'up', 'Di', 'Nero', 'Ben', 'course', 'well', 'well']",N/A

I really did seeth at the utter mindless cruelty of these people to Greg.  It was not so fun to watch.  I think people who genuinely enjoy this movie the first time are sociopathic to some degree.HOWEVER, i happened to find myself watching it again quite unexpectly and since I knew the final outcome, I was able to relax and not feel so much for Greg.

I needn't have feared: the movie sustains itself, even with the simplest of plots, remarkably well.
