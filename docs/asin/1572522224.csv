186377,A14PS3LPIO7UF8,1572522224,"Dawoud Kringle ""Renegade Sufi""","[8, 8]","Rather than engage in the back and forth of these reviews, permit me to offer one slightly different observation.When the abbot monk is asked how he lived to be over 100, he said ""I eat at the time to eat, and sleep at the time to sleep.""Later, a woman had appeared and requested to become a nun. The hero, a former warlord  who was hiding from his past, shaved her head, and in doing so, became aroused.One night, she crept into his bed chamber and said ""You are not a monk"". She mentioned the way he carressed her when he shaved her head, his strong shoulders, etc. Inevitabley, nature took its course. After they tickled each other's fancy, she gently and seductively tied his wrists with a piece of leather, stradled him, and introduced herself as the widow of another warlord whom he had killed. She then started biting him on the jugular vein. Our hero struggled to be free, to no avail.Suddenly, the old monk appeared out of nowhere, did some kind fo kung fu move with his walking stick, and killed the woman by striking her at the base of her skull. Our hero lay there, amazed and shocked. The old monk shook his head and walked away, muttering ""No sleep at the time to sleep.""Let's be honest; could an American have come up with this?",4,I liked it!,1232150400,"01 17, 2009",2009,1243,"['Rather', 'engage', 'back', 'forth', 'reviews', 'permit', 'offer', 'one', 'slightly', 'different', 'abbot', 'monk', 'asked', 'how', 'lived', 'be', '100', 'said', 'eat', 'time', 'eat', 'sleep', 'time', 'sleep', 'Later', 'woman', 'had', 'appeared', 'requested', 'become', 'nun', 'hero', 'former', 'warlord', 'who', 'was', 'hiding', 'past', 'shaved', 'head', 'doing', 'so', 'became', 'aroused.One', 'night', 'crept', 'bed', 'chamber', 'said', 'are', 'not', 'monk', 'mentioned', 'way', 'carressed', 'when', 'shaved', 'head', 'strong', 'shoulders', 'etc', 'Inevitabley', 'nature', 'took', 'course', 'tickled', 'other', 'fancy', 'gently', 'seductively', 'tied', 'wrists', 'piece', 'leather', 'stradled', 'introduced', 'widow', 'warlord', 'whom', 'had', 'killed', 'then', 'started', 'biting', 'jugular', 'vein', 'hero', 'struggled', 'be', 'free', 'avail.Suddenly', 'old', 'monk', 'appeared', 'nowhere', 'did', 'kind', 'fo', 'kung', 'fu', 'move', 'walking', 'stick', 'killed', 'woman', 'striking', 'base', 'skull', 'hero', 'lay', 'there', 'amazed', 'shocked', 'old', 'monk', 'shook', 'head', 'walked', 'away', 'muttering', 'No', 'sleep', 'time', 'sleep', 'Let', 'be', 'honest', 'could', 'American', 'have', 'come', 'up']",Temptation of a Monk
186378,A1HHAPZV8UWT6T,1572522224,Jacqui,"[6, 10]","Why am I so harsh on this film? This 1993 effort is virtually a rip-off of the kind of highly stylized epics that characterized Akira Kurosawa's  films of the 1980's. Specifically it is too similar to the 1985 Ran in  terms of script, style, and even the costumes and sets.Other than being  a totally inferior and embarrassing attempt to emulate the master, it is  also guilty of historical inaccuracy (if it's a  fantasy that why not go  all the way - why the pretentious tone of a historical epic which it is  not?!), exoticism (*all* the women in the film and even the men in the  brothel), glorification of violence (whose sensual beauty tries to gloss  over the very poor script) and terrible acting by all the performers.The dialogue, to my native Chinese-speaking ears, are nothing short of  uncreative and hurriedly thrown-together hodge podge of ancient maxims  and  trite cliches any film trying to be original and substantial should avoid.  Sure, Joan Chen is a beautiful actress but even her star power or  any  artistic integrity she isn't going to help the script or the general  execution of this pathetic rip-off at all. Obviously a Chinese-Australian  production aimed at the international market, in the guise of a historical  Asian epic....ARRRRRRGH!

186379,A2X25C107CSLOR,1572522224,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[3, 6]","Hong Kong director Clara Law's film is based on a novel by Lillian Lee, who also wrote Farewell My Concubine. Set in China's Tang dynasty, it concerns the antagonism between two generals, Shi (Wu Hsin-Kuo) and Huo Da (Zhang Fengyi) who plot to overthrow the Emperor. Shi retreats from the fight when the ascendant heir is killed and seeks refuge in a Buddhist monastery. Law lacks the narrative skill to elucidate the story, relying instead on random set pieces, which occasionally redeem her painfully slow pace. The stylised use of colour and choreography in the opening ceremony and in an extended brothel sequence are very lovely, and she out-Peckinpah's Peckinpah in savage slow-motion massacres. Law has a good eye for composition, favouring the use of wind and smoke in her exteriors, and the burning of a house near the end is very beautiful. The brothel sequence features a transvestite, and the sex scene between Shi and a nun is all the more erotic because their shaved heads give it a particular subtext. Of the actors, Joan Chen manages to connect with the audience, though her screen time is limited, and the abbott monk raises a few laughs.",2,temptation can be a passive response,992736000,"06 17, 2001",2001,1155,"['Hong', 'Kong', 'director', 'Clara', 'Law', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Lillian', 'Lee', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'Farewell', 'My', 'Concubine', 'Set', 'China', 'Tang', 'dynasty', 'antagonism', 'two', 'generals', 'Shi', 'Wu', 'Hsin-Kuo', 'Huo', 'Da', 'Zhang', 'Fengyi', 'who', 'plot', 'overthrow', 'Emperor', 'Shi', 'fight', 'when', 'ascendant', 'heir', 'killed', 'refuge', 'Buddhist', 'monastery', 'Law', 'narrative', 'skill', 'elucidate', 'story', 'relying', 'instead', 'random', 'set', 'pieces', 'occasionally', 'redeem', 'painfully', 'slow', 'pace', 'stylised', 'use', 'colour', 'choreography', 'opening', 'ceremony', 'extended', 'brothel', 'sequence', 'are', 'very', 'lovely', 'out-Peckinpah', 'Peckinpah', 'savage', 'slow-motion', 'massacres', 'Law', 'good', 'eye', 'composition', 'favouring', 'use', 'wind', 'smoke', 'exteriors', 'burning', 'house', 'end', 'very', 'beautiful', 'brothel', 'sequence', 'transvestite', 'sex', 'scene', 'Shi', 'nun', 'more', 'erotic', 'shaved', 'heads', 'give', 'particular', 'subtext', 'actors', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'connect', 'audience', 'screen', 'time', 'limited', 'abbott', 'monk', 'few', 'laughs']",Temptation of a Monk

It's beautiful with a intriguing story.With that out of the way let me again point out that Fox/Lorber has again put out a poor DVD edition of another film.  The subtitles are on  the film and very big.  I guess I shouldn't complain as you can read them,  unlike most of Fox/Lorber films.This is in Full Screen.  I wish  someone could explain to me how Fox/Lorber can call their movies widescreen  with they are full frame?  Someone should call them on this fact as they  repeatedly call their movies widescreen that are obviously full screen.The video is decent as is the audio.  All I can say is that it's  watchable and doesn't take too much away from the original.  But again it's  just a poor transfer.Oh well...if you are like me and really want to  see this film it is probably the only version that will come out.
