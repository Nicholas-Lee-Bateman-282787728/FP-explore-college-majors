367743,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303269869,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","It's a little heavy-handed and comes off a bit syrupy at the end, but `When a Man Loves a Woman' is an effective tear-jerker of a drama that accurately handles the tragedy that is alcoholism.  It manages to take no sides in the matter and portray both spectrums of the disease, looking objectively at the alcoholic themselves as well as the sober mate as he tries to pick up the pieces.  It refuses to really place any blame, even when it tells you that it is and I think that was a wise step since there really is no blame to be placed in situations like this.  You get better, you move forward.  When you stop to point the finger you regress.The film takes a look at a middle class suburban family torn to pieces because of the wife's battle with alcohol.  Alice Green seems to be the perfect mother and spouse from the outside but she harbors a dirty secret.  She hides her problem from her family; her husband included, but when things really hit their bottom there is no denying what needs to be done.  Alice enters rehab in order to clean up, to get sober and stay there to protect her family.  This leaves a strain on her husband Michael to take care of their two daughters Jessica and Casey, as well as work and take care of the home.  The stress of having his wife away from him, not knowing how she is doing at all times, eats away at him and causes divisions between him and others that he comes in contact with, like the Green's housekeeper Amy.What I love so much about this film is that it exposes the fact that the disease is not the only problem causing agent.  Most people feel that when one suffers from a substance problem they can fix it and move on and everything will be better but the fact remains that that is not the case.  When Alice returns home, sober and clean, her fights with Michael intensify to the point where they start to loathe one another.  It casts a light on the fact that the rehabilitation process is just as painful sometimes as the disease itself.  People change when they are sober, and that is brought to the forefront too.  It's clear that, while he doesn't want to admit it, Michael misses the woman his wife was when she was drunk.  He misses her wild side as well as his ability to put her back together when she fell to pieces.  It's a time of adjustment, not just for the `sick' mate but for the entire family.Meg Ryan is astonishing here.  It sickens me to know she was snubbed of the Oscar nomination (she's my personal winner this year) for her performance is so accurate and effortless.  She manages to display every confused emotion you'd expect to see from an alcoholic going through rehab.  She manages to capture her character brilliantly.  Andy Garcia works here, but his performance doesn't carry the same weight as Ryan's.  He manages to capture the confusion and pain of the worried spouse well but he's almost too subtle at times, so subtle that his outbursts seem a bit theatrical.  Tina Majorino is amazing as the eldest daughter Jessica.  She was quite the star in 94 with `When a Man Loves a Woman' and `Corrina, Corrina' coming out back to back and showcasing this young girls talent.In the end `When a Man Loves a Woman' delivers.  It really works as a dramatic film to capture the harsh realities of alcoholism and even teaches the viewer of the consequences that come from all sides of the equation.  Like I mentioned in the beginning, the film is a bit heavy handed.  It tries really hard to make this as tragic as can be.  It also comes off syrupy at the end, as in `let's make this as devastating as possible that way when everything gets fixed the whole audience will burst into tears'.  Sadly, I hated the ending.  It was too corny for my taste and took away from the film's feeling of reality, at least in my opinion.  But, the entire film leading up to the last thirty seconds is phenomenal and deserves major attention.  Even if `When a Man Loves a Woman' is not you cup of tea you must admit that Meg Ryan chews up the scenery like it were candy and delivers an orgasmic performance worthy of much praise and admiration.",4,An accurate portrayal of the destructive force that is alcoholism...,1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,4102,"['little', 'heavy-handed', 'off', 'bit', 'syrupy', 'end', 'When', 'Man', 'Woman', 'effective', 'tear-jerker', 'drama', 'accurately', 'tragedy', 'alcoholism', 'take', 'sides', 'matter', 'portray', 'spectrums', 'disease', 'looking', 'objectively', 'alcoholic', 'as', 'well', 'sober', 'mate', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'really', 'place', 'blame', 'even', 'when', 'think', 'was', 'wise', 'step', 'really', 'blame', 'be', 'placed', 'situations', 'get', 'better', 'move', 'forward', 'When', 'stop', 'point', 'finger', 'regress.The', 'film', 'look', 'middle', 'class', 'suburban', 'family', 'torn', 'pieces', 'wife', 'battle', 'alcohol', 'Alice', 'Green', 'be', 'perfect', 'mother', 'spouse', 'outside', 'dirty', 'secret', 'problem', 'family', 'husband', 'included', 'when', 'things', 'really', 'hit', 'bottom', 'denying', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'Alice', 'enters', 'rehab', 'order', 'clean', 'up', 'get', 'sober', 'stay', 'there', 'protect', 'family', 'strain', 'husband', 'Michael', 'take', 'care', 'two', 'daughters', 'Jessica', 'Casey', 'as', 'well', 'work', 'take', 'care', 'home', 'stress', 'having', 'wife', 'away', 'not', 'knowing', 'how', 'doing', 'times', 'away', 'divisions', 'others', 'contact', 'Green', 'housekeeper', 'Amy.What', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'fact', 'disease', 'not', 'only', 'problem', 'causing', 'agent', 'Most', 'people', 'feel', 'when', 'one', 'suffers', 'substance', 'problem', 'can', 'fix', 'move', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'fact', 'not', 'case', 'When', 'Alice', 'home', 'sober', 'clean', 'fights', 'Michael', 'intensify', 'point', 'where', 'start', 'loathe', 'one', 'light', 'fact', 'rehabilitation', 'process', 'just', 'as', 'painful', 'sometimes', 'disease', 'People', 'change', 'when', 'are', 'sober', 'brought', 'forefront', 'too', 'clear', ""n't"", 'want', 'admit', 'Michael', 'woman', 'wife', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'drunk', 'wild', 'side', 'as', 'well', 'ability', 'put', 'back', 'together', 'when', 'fell', 'pieces', 'time', 'adjustment', 'not', 'just', 'sick', 'mate', 'entire', 'family.Meg', 'Ryan', 'astonishing', 'here', 'know', 'was', 'snubbed', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'personal', 'winner', 'year', 'performance', 'so', 'accurate', 'effortless', 'display', 'confused', 'emotion', ""'d"", 'expect', 'see', 'alcoholic', 'going', 'rehab', 'capture', 'character', 'brilliantly', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'here', 'performance', ""n't"", 'carry', 'same', 'weight', 'Ryan', 'capture', 'confusion', 'pain', 'worried', 'spouse', 'well', 'almost', 'too', 'subtle', 'times', 'so', 'subtle', 'outbursts', 'seem', 'bit', 'theatrical', 'Tina', 'Majorino', 'amazing', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Jessica', 'was', 'quite', 'star', '94', 'When', 'Man', 'Woman', 'Corrina', 'Corrina', 'coming', 'out', 'back', 'back', 'showcasing', 'young', 'girls', 'talent.In', 'end', 'When', 'Man', 'Woman', 'delivers', 'really', 'dramatic', 'film', 'capture', 'harsh', 'realities', 'alcoholism', 'even', 'viewer', 'consequences', 'come', 'sides', 'equation', 'mentioned', 'beginning', 'film', 'bit', 'heavy', 'handed', 'really', 'hard', 'make', 'as', 'tragic', 'can', 'be', 'also', 'off', 'syrupy', 'end', 'let', 'make', 'as', 'devastating', 'possible', 'way', 'when', 'everything', 'fixed', 'whole', 'audience', 'will', 'burst', 'tears', 'Sadly', 'hated', 'ending', 'was', 'too', 'corny', 'taste', 'took', 'away', 'film', 'feeling', 'reality', 'least', 'opinion', 'entire', 'film', 'leading', 'up', 'last', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'phenomenal', 'major', 'attention', 'Even', 'When', 'Man', 'Woman', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'must', 'admit', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'up', 'scenery', 'were', 'candy', 'delivers', 'orgasmic', 'performance', 'worthy', 'much', 'praise', 'admiration']",When a Man Loves a Woman VHS

367747,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6303269869,Bobby Underwood,"[4, 4]","This subdued but tender and gut-wrenching look at two people who desperately love each other but find their marriage unravelling because of the bottle has two genuinely moving performances from Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan. At first quietly touching, and as it progresses, ultimately heartbreaking, it is like watching a terrible car crash in slow motion. You can't take your eyes away from the screen because you must know the fate of the family inside.Written by Ronald Bass and Al Franken, the beautiful photography of Lajos Koltai is in contrast to the sad music score of Zbigniew Preisner, highlighting the difference between appearances and the real picture just beneath the surface. Director Luis Mandoki begins the film in romantic fashion but soon peels back the layers to expose a marriage in deep trouble.Andy Garcia is amazingly good in an understated performance as a husband very much in love with a wife who has become a liitle too drunk a little too often. A pilot for a major airline, he has all the trappings of happiness. Two adorable little girls and a nice home, however, can offer no magic answers when he sees the woman he loves sliding and is at a loss what to do to stop it. Like any husband, Michael Green wants to fix things but can't admit he doesn't know how.Meg Ryan is flawlessly genuine as his wife, Alice Green. A trip to Mexico to ease the supposed pressure prompting her to drink too much only puts a spotlight on how far she has fallen when a tragedy nearly occurs. But it is a moment alone with her oldest daughter which will finally force her into a treatment center. Rather than cliches, this film shows there are no easy answers. Michael is disquieted then shocked at just how much the children saw and knew about their mother's problem. Things of which he himself was unaware.The underlying problems still remain when she returns and tries to readjust and you can truly feel the frustration of the coulple. Finally separating, Garcia is truly magnificent in scenes with the two young girls from Ryan's previous marriage he considers his own. Meg's finest moment in the film comes near the end and should have put her into Oscar contention. Tina Majorino as their older daughter and Lauren Tom as their babysitter deserve mention as well. Quietly played performances with the thoughtful intelligence you see more often in foreign films seemed to work against the picture's stars in this regard.This film is ultimately about love and is quite romantic. It is a mature romance, however, devoid of pretense and not seen through rose colored glasses. A beautifully conceived drama which leaves a lasting impression on the heart and a film everyone should see.",5,Everybody Hurts Sometimes.....,1219536000,"08 24, 2008",2008,2691,"['subdued', 'tender', 'gut-wrenching', 'look', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'desperately', 'love', 'other', 'find', 'marriage', 'unravelling', 'bottle', 'two', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'performances', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'first', 'quietly', 'touching', 'ultimately', 'heartbreaking', 'watching', 'terrible', 'car', 'crash', 'slow', 'motion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'away', 'screen', 'must', 'know', 'fate', 'family', 'inside.Written', 'Ronald', 'Bass', 'Al', 'Franken', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'Lajos', 'Koltai', 'contrast', 'sad', 'music', 'score', 'Zbigniew', 'Preisner', 'highlighting', 'difference', 'appearances', 'real', 'picture', 'just', 'surface', 'Director', 'Luis', 'Mandoki', 'film', 'romantic', 'fashion', 'soon', 'peels', 'back', 'layers', 'expose', 'marriage', 'deep', 'trouble.Andy', 'Garcia', 'amazingly', 'good', 'understated', 'performance', 'husband', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'wife', 'who', 'become', 'liitle', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'often', 'pilot', 'major', 'airline', 'trappings', 'happiness', 'Two', 'adorable', 'little', 'girls', 'nice', 'home', 'however', 'can', 'offer', 'magic', 'answers', 'when', 'woman', 'sliding', 'loss', 'what', 'do', 'stop', 'husband', 'Michael', 'Green', 'fix', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'admit', ""n't"", 'know', 'how.Meg', 'Ryan', 'flawlessly', 'genuine', 'wife', 'Alice', 'Green', 'trip', 'Mexico', 'ease', 'supposed', 'pressure', 'prompting', 'drink', 'too', 'much', 'only', 'spotlight', 'how', 'far', 'fallen', 'when', 'tragedy', 'nearly', 'occurs', 'moment', 'alone', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'will', 'finally', 'force', 'treatment', 'center', 'Rather', 'cliches', 'film', 'are', 'easy', 'answers', 'Michael', 'disquieted', 'then', 'shocked', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'children', 'saw', 'knew', 'mother', 'problem', 'Things', 'was', 'unaware.The', 'underlying', 'problems', 'still', 'remain', 'when', 'tries', 'readjust', 'can', 'truly', 'feel', 'frustration', 'coulple', 'Finally', 'separating', 'Garcia', 'truly', 'magnificent', 'scenes', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'Ryan', 'previous', 'marriage', 'own', 'Meg', 'finest', 'moment', 'film', 'end', 'should', 'have', 'put', 'Oscar', 'contention', 'Tina', 'Majorino', 'older', 'daughter', 'Lauren', 'Tom', 'babysitter', 'deserve', 'mention', 'well', 'Quietly', 'played', 'performances', 'thoughtful', 'intelligence', 'see', 'more', 'often', 'foreign', 'films', 'seemed', 'work', 'picture', 'stars', 'regard.This', 'film', 'ultimately', 'love', 'quite', 'romantic', 'mature', 'romance', 'however', 'devoid', 'pretense', 'not', 'seen', 'rose', 'colored', 'glasses', 'beautifully', 'conceived', 'drama', 'lasting', 'impression', 'heart', 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'see']",When a Man Loves a Woman VHS

Interesting. From the title it sounds like it is going to be a romance, even a romantic comedy, but it is a serious drama about a man who is married to an alcoholic. Michael Green (Andy Garcia) is a pilot who meets Alice (Meg Ryan) in the Buena Vista Caf&eacute; in Fisherman's Wharf. Actually, it is in what we San Franciscans used to call The Marina. It is the bar where Irish Coffee was invented. If you are ever in San Francisco, try one. Even if it is something for tourists, it is an experience not to be missed. Unless you are an alcoholic and shouldn't drink.Alice Green, for instance, should not have another Irish Coffee at the Buena Vista Caf&eacute;, or Dolce, Hemlock Tavern, Zeitgeist, Holy Cow, Harry Denton's Starlight Room, Martuni's, Endup, The Stud, Specs', Savoy Tivoli, Vesuvio, Kimo's, Bondage a Go-Go, Arrow Bar, Boom Boom Room, Ten 15 Folsom, 330 Ritch, El Rio, Ginger's Trois, Midnight Sun, Bix, Motherlode, The Lexington Club, ELBO Room, and Shotwell's, ever, under any circumstances.-------------------Alice Green: I drink a quart a day. It's vodka so you couldn't smell it.===============================This was a good, serious drama. If you are drinking a quart a day, though, you could smell it, vodka or not. In spite of a few relapses, it was a very realistic depiction of alcoholism. It didn't just have a fake Hollywood ending either, where Alice stopped drinking, took it one day at a time, and lived happily ever after. It also dealt with the enabling behavior of her husband, Michael, and the fact that just because you stop drinking doesn't mean there aren't other issues that you'll have to deal with. It showed the devastating effect that alcoholism can have on the children. The performance of Tina Majorino was incredible as the oldest child, Jessica Green. She really conveys the confusion that children of alcoholics feel. She loves her mother, but when she gets drunk, she hits her. She doesn't stop loving her, but she isn't unscathed. Tina Majorino did a great job, for such a young thespian.Al Franken, now Senator Franken, formerly Stuart Smallie on SNL, who was good enough, smart enough, and dog gone it, people liked him, wrote the script along with Ronald Bass. Franken and Bass did a really good job with the script. It was based on a ten page synopsis by Orson Welles. I thought that Senator Franken was just a clown, but I guess he has a serious side. Who knew? He also has a cameo as the co-pilot, but he never says much.Maybe you are saying that you don't want to see a movie about alcoholism because you don't have a drinking problem. Hey, you drink, you fall down. You get back up. No problem. Work is the curse of the drinking class. Though denial is not just a river in Egypt, the talent of Meg Ryan, Tina Majorino, Andy Garcia, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Al Franken, and Mae Whitcomb cannot be denied. Alice Green may have called her daughter's outfit a 'sad little ensemble' but the actors of ""When a Man Loves a Woman"" are a great ensemble.-------------------Michael Green: My wife is an

If I was to let myself cry, this movie would've been it, not ""The Joy Luck Club"".  Andy Garcia surely deserved an Oscar nomination.  He was simply great.  I was not a big fan of his, but here he clearly impressed me.  Of course, he was also terrific in ""The Godfather Part 3"".  Meg Ryan was effective, but still a little too cutsey, with the same mannerisms she uses in all her films.  But the two daughters were outstanding, especially the older one, played by Tina Majorino, who appears to be about 7 or 8.  Also, the look of the film, set in San Francisco, is good, especially the interiors of their house.  Garcia really seems to care about Ryan.  This movie is about love, and how it doesn't always carry the day with alcoholics.  I also liked the fact that this movie picks up in the middle of things, they've been married and had a kid (you don't learn til much later that he is not the older kid's dad), and we see her drink a lot.

The demons of addiction thrive and perpetuate in a black vacuum of mental and emotional despair; only the steadfast love and support of others can exorcise them.And indeed it is love that ultimately breaks through the shackles of alcoholism in director Luis Mandoki's gripping film, WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN.  Michael and Alice Green (Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan) are a young couple deeply in love--so much so that Michael tends to downplay his wife's growing dependence on alcohol.  Only when Alice's addiction plunges her down a desperate, dysfunctional vortex--from rummaging through trash looking for vodka bottles to passing out in the shower--does Michael come to the jarring conclusion that he is on the verge of losing his wife to an insidious disease.  Alice is placed in rehab, and Michael's devotion is put to the test:  from his discomfort with support groups to Alice's subsequent aloof and detached demeanor.  Life after addiction will not be easy, for Alice, Michael, or their two daughters.But again, love never is easy.Garcia and Ryan give compelling, realistic performances.  I also was moved by the performance of young Tina Majorino, who plays Garcia's stepdaughter Jessica.  Over the course of the movie, father and stepdaughter form an emotional bond as they attempt to keep their fragile family together, and the strain on young Jessica shows.I was shocked to learn comedic satirist Al Franken cowrote the screenply; what a departure from his usual material, but Franken obviously knows his subject matter here.  WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN is anything but a &quot;feel good&quot; film, but there is little good to be gleaned from a story about addiction.  But this movie succeeds through its powerful depiction of devotion and love--a power that will keep the viewer riveted and engrossed from beginning to end.--D.

Fresh off her perky roles in hits like &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; and &quot;When Harry met Sally,&quot; the part of Alice Green is a super acting part for Ryan and she is up to the challenge. Andy Garcia, then on the cusp of mega-stardom (it never panned out, oddly enough) had to settle for the part of victimized, shut-out husband,but he makes the makes the most of it. So why do I only give this film 3 stars ? The problem is in the script. The story is full of holes and under-developed plot lines. Why did the writers not delve into Alice's failed first marriage, her relationship with her parents (we only discover that her father is an alcoholic in the film's final 5 minutes), or show the professional consequences of Alice's behavior.

Andy Garcia (Michael Green) plays her husband who knows that she has a problem, but just is not ready to face the fact that she needs help or she is going to hurt herself or one of the children.When Alice finally does get the help she needs, Michael doesn't cope well with the fact that she now has other people to turn to when things get rough.  Michael does try to go to a support meeting for family memebers, but just sees it as a bunch of people sitting around feeling sorry for each other.  He thinks that things will just 'go back to normal' now that she has gotten help and just isn't that simple.Although the effects that her drinking had on the kids was not addressed, I felt that it touched most of the bases that a family goes through after recovery.You will need a box of tissues by your side for this tear jerker.",5,Great Movie,994723200,"07 10, 2001",2001,1272,"['Coming', 'alcoholic', 'family', 'was', 'able', 'relate', 'children', 'movie', 'think', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'played', 'part', 'perfectly', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'different', 'look', 'serious', 'disease', 'fact', 'mother', 'was', 'alcoholic.Meg', 'Ryan', 'Alice', 'Green', 'wife', 'mother', 'two', 'who', 'control', 'drinking', 'problem', 'almost', 'dying', 'shower', 'make', 'realize', 'problem', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'Michael', 'Green', 'husband', 'who', 'problem', 'just', 'not', 'ready', 'face', 'fact', 'help', 'going', 'hurt', 'one', 'children.When', 'Alice', 'finally', 'get', 'help', 'Michael', ""n't"", 'cope', 'well', 'fact', 'now', 'other', 'people', 'turn', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'rough', 'Michael', 'try', 'go', 'support', 'meeting', 'family', 'memebers', 'just', 'bunch', 'people', 'sitting', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'other', 'things', 'will', 'just', ""'go"", 'back', 'normal', 'now', 'gotten', 'help', 'just', ""n't"", 'simple.Although', 'effects', 'drinking', 'had', 'kids', 'was', 'not', 'addressed', 'felt', 'touched', 'most', 'bases', 'family', 'recovery.You', 'will', 'need', 'box', 'tissues', 'side', 'tear', 'jerker']",When a Man Loves a Woman VHS

From being the proverbial perfect couple, to the subtle hints, the dangerous behavior, the acknowledgement, the self-loathing, the denial and the even more tragic recovery process, this movie covers the subject flawlessly.As a university professor, I often used segments of this incredible movie as a presentation of the struggles of recovery.What saddens me, was my realization of how few people know about this incredible movie. I can only surmise that it was not a &#34;hit&#34; movie due to its realistic depiction of alcoholism and its tragic consequences in modern society. After all, most Americans would rather watch movies of disturbing violence, sexual deviance and other dysfunctional subjects rather than deal with the realities of their own struggles. Ultimately that is what this movie accomplishes... it causes us to look inside of ourselves (and at our loved ones) with a healthier and stronger perspective.Kudos to Al Franken, Meg Ryan, Andy Garcia and all who helps create this incredible work of art.

367774,AHTRI0YTKGWS2,6303269869,JR Peterman,"[2, 5]","The scenario of a family dealing with a wife being the abuser rather than the husband is not commonly explored, yet this particular plot was ill-conceived, which almost makes it a crime. If a story as important as this can't be told well, it's better not to tell it at all, or the effect is that the viewers are numbed to a reality people should care more about. And when I finished watching this film, I yawned and put in something more gripping, while I should have at the very least been lulled into a few moments of reflection or contemplation.For the most part, though the screenplay wasn't great, I feel poor casting is responsible for the film's failure. Try as she might, it just doesn't seem Meg Ryan can be taken seriously doing much else than romantic comedy. No, she isn't a bad actress, but the quirky, cute persona is what carries her, and when she attempts to be serious, she comes off as a little witchy and intolerant, not at all sympathetic or likable. In this particular role as the substance-abusing wife and mother, she doesn't  inspire sympathy, never expresses any depth of confliction, and never convincingly emerges with dignity, though I suspect it was meant to be an empowering story.Andy Garcia is &quot;blah&quot; as her husband. Yes, he's suitable as a nice guy who is confused as he both supports her and tries to hold her accountable, but he often comes across less confused and reticent and more wary and aloof as if he's actually secretly distracted by his dealings as a mob flunky or something.The best performance is by Tina Majorino, who doesn't for a moment look like the spawn of Ryan and Garcia, but who's authentic reactions of fear and confusion when victimized by her mother are heart-rending. Thus to the film's credit, I guess the reality of a child being the most vulnerable victim in situations of substance abuse is demonstrated, but is not a strong enough impression to make this an even moderately impressive film.",2,But she tries so hard...,1078099200,"03 1, 2004",2004,1964,"['scenario', 'family', 'dealing', 'wife', 'being', 'abuser', 'rather', 'husband', 'not', 'commonly', 'explored', 'yet', 'particular', 'plot', 'was', 'ill-conceived', 'almost', 'crime', 'story', 'as', 'important', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'told', 'well', 'better', 'not', 'tell', 'effect', 'viewers', 'are', 'numbed', 'reality', 'people', 'should', 'care', 'more', 'when', 'finished', 'watching', 'film', 'yawned', 'put', 'something', 'more', 'gripping', 'should', 'have', 'very', 'least', 'been', 'lulled', 'few', 'moments', 'reflection', 'contemplation.For', 'most', 'part', 'screenplay', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'feel', 'poor', 'casting', 'responsible', 'film', 'failure', 'Try', 'might', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'doing', 'much', 'else', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'No', ""n't"", 'bad', 'actress', 'quirky', 'cute', 'persona', 'what', 'when', 'be', 'serious', 'off', 'little', 'witchy', 'intolerant', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'likable', 'particular', 'role', 'substance-abusing', 'wife', 'mother', ""n't"", 'inspire', 'sympathy', 'never', 'depth', 'confliction', 'never', 'convincingly', 'dignity', 'suspect', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'empowering', 'story.Andy', 'Garcia', 'quot', 'quot', 'husband', 'Yes', 'suitable', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'confused', 'tries', 'hold', 'accountable', 'often', 'across', 'less', 'confused', 'reticent', 'more', 'wary', 'aloof', 'actually', 'secretly', 'distracted', 'dealings', 'mob', 'flunky', 'something.The', 'best', 'performance', 'Tina', 'Majorino', 'who', ""n't"", 'moment', 'look', 'spawn', 'Ryan', 'Garcia', 'who', 'authentic', 'reactions', 'fear', 'confusion', 'when', 'victimized', 'mother', 'are', 'heart-rending', 'Thus', 'film', 'credit', 'guess', 'reality', 'child', 'being', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'victim', 'situations', 'substance', 'abuse', 'demonstrated', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'impression', 'make', 'even', 'moderately', 'impressive', 'film']",When a Man Loves a Woman VHS

367785,AAYE34TCTNV2R,6303269869,MarlowesMom,"[4, 4]","A thoughtful, insightful movie. Don't coming looking for a romantic comedy or you will be disappointed. I was curious about it because Al Franken had co-written the screenplay. I was familiar with his career as a Saturday Night Live performer and writer and his political satire. As the child of a non-recovered alcoholic parent, I was interested, especially after he launched his Senate campaign, to see how he would handle a difficult, serious, topic of an intimate, personal nature. Al and the rest of the filmmakers did a fine job with a subject that is usually handled in a trite, happy-ever-after ending way.The movie asks the interesting question: what's harder, the alcoholism or the recovery?Meg Ryan's character, Alice, drank a lot even before she and her husband, played by Andy Garcia, got married. Alice is a charming, fun drunk. Andy, a caretaker personality, seems to enjoy peeling her off whatever surface she's landed on and carrying her to bed--at least when he's home, which is not all the time since he's an airline pilot. Unfortunately, Alice progresses from being the life of the party to drinking vodka for breakfast. She's not so much fun any more, in fact, she's a wreck, and you won't like her. Her drinking threatens the physical safety and emotional health of her children as drives them around and strikes out at them irrationally when she's drunk. Alice finally is so scared at the danger she's put her children into that she realizes she's out of control and goes into rehab.The drinking part of the movie is more heart-wrenching than usual because the danger to the children is more graphic than is usually shown. However, the rehab portion of the movie is where it really departs from cliche and challenges the audience. While Alice goes through the process, she cannot see her family, nor does she particularly want to. When she comes home, she's a transformed person. She's got an edge to her, a fierceness, she did not have before, and she has to cling to that difference to avoid falling back into her old patterns. Her husband, who has been comfortable in the caretaker role, does not know what to do. He wants to take care of her and help her as he has always done, but she now must take care of herself. Their old marital paradigm is dead, and whether they can find a new paradigm is not at all clear. You might see a happy ending; I saw an ending where things might get better, but there are no guarantees.My husband did not find Meg Ryan's performance persuasive. I thought she did quite a good job outside her usual bubbly-cute persona, though she never looks as bad as someone who drinks as much as her character drinks would be expected to look. At least she's not afraid to create a character the audience won't like. Andy Garcia and the supporting actors are excellent.

The scene at the marriage counselor had some  promise but then it ended too soon and was not revisited.  Again that scene  was great for Meg's character but did not do much for sphinx-face Andy.

But, to my surprise, it was so much more.Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia are good as Alice and Michael Green.  I liked  the fact that the movie dealt with Alice's alcoholism.  She realizes that  she has a major problem with alcohol.  Eventually, she goes into  rehabilitation.I'm glad that they didn't stop the movie with her coming  out of rehab and life will be all wonderful and fuzzy.  What happens is  that with Alice sober, Michael doesn't have anyone to rescue anymore.  It  is good to watch how their relationship changes with Alice's new found  sobriety.  Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia do a great job in showing how  alcoholism can effectively mess up a relationship and family.It's been  a while since I have seen this movie, but there are some wonderful  supporting performances to mention.  Tina Majorino as the oldest daughter,  Jess, is astonishing.  She shows a lot of emotion for the daughter of an  alcoholic.  I think that she could have easily been nominated for a Best  Supporting Actress Oscar.Also, Lauren Tom as Amy, the Green's  nanny/housekeeper, is incredible.  Her character does not really like  Michael Green very much.  The scene where Michael begs her to come back and  help the family is great.  Amy definitely does not make it easy for  him.This movie is definitely not light-hearted fair.  In fact, I would  really not recommend this for children.
