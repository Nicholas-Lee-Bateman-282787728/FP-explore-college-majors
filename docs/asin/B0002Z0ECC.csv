851934,A3UR9M6DLAXTU7,B0002Z0ECC,Colby,"[1, 1]","Where do I begin? How do I successfully express my feelings towards the &#34;Before&#34; saga in the form of an Amazon review? Especially when my feelings are so vivid, yet seem to cling to my tongue? I've tried telling friends about my love for this film saga, but I never seem to reach my own goal of satisfied proclamation. For this review, maybe I should just start from the beginning.My first encounter with this cinematic story happened, actually, very recently. I remember seeing the poster art and advertising material, vaguely, as a child. And since the films are rated R, which automatically makes them a big no-no in my LDS home, I was never allowed to watch them. But eventually I turned 17 and I began to add films with the forbidden rating to my humble collection. Without the consent or approval of my parents. Which felt liberating. Films like Kill Bill, Evil Dead, and Apocalypto both shocked and thrilled me. The Dreamers took me to a different dimension. The Shining blew my mind. I was like a kid in the candy store, standing in front of a brand new isle, an isle only available to those who can handle the candy within.Suffice it to say, the sweet high I got from rebelling soon went away and I began watching films based on the films themselves, not on the ratings. I was suddenly free to experience the classics, the cult films, the experimental side of cinema, and my interests broadened. As I've entered my early twenties, films like Transformers and The Avengers suddenly seem very trivial. I now crave a film with a much more substantial stroke. In the past two years I've fallen in love with films like Secret Sunshine, Another Happy Day, and even Shame, which is a film that practically slashes the very foundation of my conservative childhood. I guess you could say I'm growing up. Dang*, it feels good.So, naturally, I read about a trilogy of films with a story that spans several years and a dedicated cast who plans to revisit the characters if life permits them to, and I am instantly intrigued. Before Sunrise? What an interesting title. My mind recalls the romantic image of the film's promotional art. Before Sunset? That image, too, of a man and a woman underneath a bridge. Then Before Midnight is being released on blu-ray, and I realize this is the perfect time to catch up, to watch this trilogy for the first time, lucky to skip the waiting periods between each release. I hop on Amazon and buy all three films, without seeing them. A &#34;blind buy&#34;, or so that's what they call it.I watch them. I fall in love. Holy shoot*, do I fall in love. Hard.Two young people meet on a train. They talk. They debate. They can't seem to pull away from each other. And thus the saga begins, a heartwarming and heartwrenching tale of two humans being drawn together, by fate, by coincidence, by whatever, just praise the gods it's been captured on camera.Watching Before Sunrise for the very first time gave me a sense of awe and trepidation. I felt vulnerable but giddy. Like I was feeding off the energy shared between these two fictional characters. Maybe I'm too emotionally attached to movie characters. Is that such a bad thing, though? Because from that moment and every moment since, I still get those feelings, that lump in my throat. And I'm okay with it. The film is so well acted, and so invigorating, that I can't stop thinking about it.If the &#34;Before&#34; saga is a living, breathing body, then Before Sunrise is the miraculous birth and the awkward shift from child to teenager. Before Sunset is two things: one, it's the vast, directionless and scary glimpse a teenager takes of their own uncertain but hopeful future, and two, it's even better than the first film.Without spoiling the story, I must say that the path of our two fictional characters, Jesse and Celine, is much more poignant and involving the second time around. The fact that Before Sunset takes place, both in real-time and in fictional-time, a good 8 or 9 years after the first adds another layer of beauty to the story. Both actors are older, emotionally and physically, but have they really changed? Watching them interact is breathtaking.Which is partly due to the acting skills and chemistry of both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, both shining brightly here. Without them, these films would fall flat. The script is another blazing triumph, creating a pair of interesting people who feel authentic, funny, relatable and unlike anything seen in most romantic flicks of our time. Calling these films the pinnacle of romantic cinema might be fair praise, indeed.Since my first viewing of these two films, which like I said was very recent, I haven't been able to erase their impact from my mind. Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delpy have created two characters who resonate so deeply with me that I'm still trying to fathom it. I feel like I'm friends with Jesse and Celine. I love them. And I cannot wait for the next chapter of their story. To eavesdrop, along with a theater full of fellow cinema lovers, lovers of these films, people who, like me, are in love with Jesse and Celine. In another 8 or 9 years, that's what I'll be doing.In the meantime, I think I'll go watch these two films again.Before Sunrise/Before Sunset: 5 out of 5 stars.The DVD combo pack comes with 2 disks. Thankfully the films are spread across 2 disks as opposed to being shoved onto a single disk, which bugs me. The picture quality and audio quality are okay, considering these are DVDs and not new releases. Still, blu-ray releases of these treasured films would be greatly appreciated, at least by this movie lover. Picture/audio quality: 3.5 out of 5 stars.Ratings: both films are rated R (which means my family will never get to experience them, a shame, but their choice) for Language and Sexual references. A few uses of the F word, along with typical language found in most PG-13 films. Some sexual references might offend some viewers. Smoking in some scenes. Honestly, I'd say ages 16 and up are fine. Although a 16 year old might not appreciate these films as much as the adults will.I will hopefully review Before Midnight as well, which is my favorite (so far) in the &#34;Before&#34; saga.* edited

They themselves didn't realize that they were both living ""single"" existances without the warmth and pleasures of sharing their lifes with someone they loved and loved them in return. They suddenly come to the realization that they were seeing the world differently than before they met, quite by chance on a train heading through Wein (the European/Local name for Vienna).  It could have been anywhere in the world for their emotions to start kicking in and kick in, they did.  A city as magnificent as Vienna could have been intrusive in a lessor story, but even with all the simple or elaborate backrounds afforded by the sites used, my eyes watched the Actor's faces and my ears collected all the things they chose to share.Some plans are made...Ten years later, we meet our ""Lovers"" again, but this time in Paris.  Once again, the shortness of time they can be together without drastic life changes, is the protagonist that pushes them forward towards their destinys together.Both films could stand alone, but I whole-heartidly suggest commiting the time for watching them both.

851955,A2J00K3J9KPQD3,B0002Z0ECC,The Dread Pirate Pastor Muppets,"[11, 13]","Every once in a while, there comes a movie or a pair of movies that make you so thankful that they can open your eyes to something much deeper and much grander than you ever expected. Upon my latest viewings of Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, I noticed a few different things, such that have heavily changed the way I look at movies and the boundless amount of creativity that can go into them instead of the standard clich&eacute;s that are presented to us too often.The whole concept of the film is inspired by experience: six years before the first film's release, director Richard Linklater met a woman in a toy shop in Philadelphia; they walked around the city together, talking as the night went on. In writing the screenplay for Before Sunrise, he chose Kim Krizan for a co-writer for the dialogue between a man and a woman to be strengthened. And what a screenplay they (along with the lead actors) wrote.The dialogue in these two movies is so unbelievably fresh that it shames nearly all romantic dramas made today. This is not just due to the dialogue, but the pacing and the events that take place are smartly devised to make us actually believe in a screen romance. For all those who have not had the fortune of seeing either film, I'll briefly sum up: in 1994, an American mal, Jesse (Ethan Hawke), is on a train heading for Vienna when he meets a French girl, Celine (Julie Delpy). After briefly conversing, he asks her to get off the train with him, even though he doesn't have enough money for a hotel. She agrees, and they walk up and down the city, and within several hours, they begin to have a romantic connection. At the end of the movie however, he has a flight to board back to the U.S. and she is heading back to college in Paris; so they agree, as they are about to leave, to meet back in Vienna in six months. The movie ends completely ambiguously.That is of course, unless you've seen Before Sunset as well. The story picks up nine years later, and Jesse has become a successful writer. He is on a book tour on his last date in Paris discussing the book, primarily its ending, when Celine shows up. The problem is that they can't pick up right where left off, so once again, they have to make the best of their time before Jesse has to once again pick up and leave for America.In my latest viewings of these two masterpieces, I worked from a different method: the first time I saw the two films, I absorbed the superb dialogue and how the line deliveries were so natural, so genuine. This time however, I decided to watch how the other performer was responding to the dialogue. And what a pair Hawke and Delpy make, for they not only make magic while talking, but through their subtle performances and their absorbance of each other's words, they help to create sincere human emotions without the use of sentimentality.Take for instance, one of the last scenes in Before Sunset when Jesse and his driver are taking Celine home. She has just lost complete control on how so many people ruined her, and how she blames Jesse for reminding her of her misfortunes with his book. He tells her that his life hasn't been as perfect as she had imagined. He speaks of his troubled marriage, and how the only thing keeping it together was his son. As he looks away out the window, she leans over to touch his hair (some say shoulder) but quickly pulls away. This is so subtly powerful because it plays out for about a split second, and then it evaporates.Their conversations in these two films are exactly what they should be: about real life, not hopes and dreams. They discuss religion, politics, problems with the world, their past, and even misguided relationships. It shows how two extraordinarily intelligent people who just happen to be complete strangers can speak of some of the strongest topics in modern society and they can fully understand one another.One of many things that helps make these movies work is the fact that Hawke and Delpy put some of their lives into the writing, particularly in Before Sunset: people have often drawn connections between Jesse's troubled marriage and Hawke's troubled marriage with Uma Thurman, while others drew the connection that both Celine and Delpy studied at NYU. Putting authentic experiences into a screenplay is often the smartest thing to do, and that's part of the reason why these movies work unbelievably well.Both films have endings that are completely ambiguous: in Before Sunrise, they promise to meet in six months time. In Before Sunset, Celine has just played for Jess a waltz she wrote, intended for their encounter in the first film. While she is then dancing to a Nina Simone CD, he fidgets with his wedding ring.I'm reviewing these two films primarily because of the impending release of Before Midnight, which I hope concludes the story (after all, less is more, right?). But if all goes well, together, these three films will be absolutely timeless. The first two are already enduring enough, but if Linklater and friends can pull if off a third time, than the world will be forever grateful.",5,Why can't all movies these days be this

851956,A3M7RECGYLXOPA,B0002Z0ECC,The Wickerman,"[22, 23]","So I've been on a pretty big Richard Linklater kick here lately.  His profoundly minimalist and surreally thought-provoking films never fail to intrigue and perplex me.  ""Before Sunrise"" and its companion ""Before Sunset"" are thus far among his most charming and engaging works.  I must say though, after experiencing the absolutely mind-bending journey that is ""Waking Life"" (which I can only describe as a mad cross between ""Slacker"" and ""The Wall""), something like this, while still pretty far from mainstream, seemed pretty pleasant and benign by comparison.However, that's a relative measure, as this is not your average love story.  It begins with ""Before Sunrise"", in which we see a young man named Jessie (Ethan Hawke), a tourist from America traveling across Europe.  While on a train to Vienna, he meets a lovely French girl named Celine (Julie Delpy), and the two immediately hit it off.  They end up spending the day together in Vienna, but both know that soon they must go their separate ways.  This brings us to the sequel, ""Before Sunset"", where fate brings them back together 9 years later.First of all, I'm glad to see that I'm able to review the two movies as a whole here, because to me it feels more like one continuous journey, even with the 9-year gap in between.  After watching the first movie, I was a bit worried that making a sequel would ruin everything somehow, but it felt like such a perfect and natural continuation and the ending (which also could have potentially ruined everything) was about as flawless of a conclusion as they could have possibly done.In true Linklater fashion, the structure of both films is very minimalist.  The whole thing is essentially one long conversation, with the two characters moving from one setting to another (think ""Slacker"", but if they stayed with the same characters instead of constantly moving to new ones).  The two touch on various deep and philosophical subjects, as well as goofy random things, and their chemistry is so perfect and natural you keep forgetting that you're watching a movie, and not just two people having a real conversation.  As always, Hawke deftly delivers Linklater's cerebral dialogue like an Olivier to his Shakespeare, and Delpy brings to her character such a perfect combination of wit, sophistication, and charm.  The two characters are both very intelligent, but not in a pretentious way that detracts from the human quality.  That way, they still feel like ""real people"", even if they're not your average joes.In the second film, we see the two reuniting in Paris, and while they've both moved on with their lives, that connection between them is obviously still there.  This one gets a bit more intense emotionally, as the past 9 years have created a lot of unresolved feelings and issues between them that finally have the chance to come to the surface.  This sort of takes away from the randomness and brings forth some semblance of (gasp!) a plot, but still the whole ""movie about nothing"" feel is never completely lost.Overall, this is the kind of love story that I enjoy.  It's never overly sappy or romantic for its own sake, and it doesn't insult your intelligence with some outrageous farfetched story.  It's just a very natural and realistic story, and the circumstances create this sort of serendipitious romance that still somehow feels plausible.  We've all experienced that ""one that got away"" kind of situation, and usually you just never see them again, but sometimes life gives you that sort of second chance, and it feels like some sort of fantastic fantasy.  And, I like how they show that this second chance isn't without its complications, as opposed to just being ""Yay, we're back together"".  That's what makes it feel more realistic and believable to me, that it's not perfect, that there's a lot of reality to go along with the fantasy.Anyway, I feel I'm rambling a bit now, but I thoroughly enjoyed both of these films, and I think it's essential that they be viewed back to back.  As with most Linklater films there is the inevitable ""this isn't for everyone"" disclaimer,  but I think these are actually among his more accessible works (not including the more mainstream stuff like ""Newton Boys"" and ""School of Rock"").  While I enjoyed films like ""Slacker"" and ""Waking Life"", those were more like a pure assault on your mind, while here there's more of an emotional aspect to go along with making you think, and I really appreciated that.  It manages to be simultaneously sweet and cerebral, which is very difficult to do this well.  Even if you're not a Linklater fan, and you just appreciate a heart-warming if not unconventional love story, these two films are a must-see.(Also, if you're brave enough to take on ""Waking Life"", Jessie and Celine make a sort of cameo appearance in it.
