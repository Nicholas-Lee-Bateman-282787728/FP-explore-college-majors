Because it is so good, I purchased Reach and the Angles, Line & Curve DVDs.  None of them is even close to as good as Center Floor is.  Reach is ok but kind of boring, too much &#34;hold&#34; positions and a lot of moves that are no fun and I can't see the reason for them - they don't appear to be as effective as many other exercises.  You have to stop and watch a lot of the moves because your head is down toward the floor on a lot of them.  Would not recommend.  Moderate sweat - did not feel fully worked out or satisfied after it.",3,Ok but not great,1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,654,"['One', 'favorite', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'Kari', 'Anderson', 'Center', 'Floor', 'excellent', 'almost', 'arm', 'work', 'so', 'good', 'purchased', 'Reach', 'Angles', 'Line', 'Curve', 'DVDs', 'None', 'even', 'close', 'as', 'good', 'Center', 'Floor', 'Reach', 'ok', 'kind', 'boring', 'too', 'much', '34', 'hold', '34', 'positions', 'lot', 'moves', 'are', 'fun', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'as', 'effective', 'many', 'other', 'exercises', 'have', 'stop', 'watch', 'lot', 'moves', 'head', 'down', 'floor', 'lot', 'Would', 'not', 'recommend', 'Moderate', 'sweat', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'fully', 'worked', 'out', 'satisfied']",Kari Anderson: Reach - Upbeat Toning & Flexibility for a Dancer's Body

This might test the flexibility for some people, but Kari Anderson reminds viewers not to push their bodies beyond limits. There is a segment at the beginning where she clarifies the principles of the workout. This is useful so we know what to bear in mind as we workout with her.The moves are relatively simple and we can concentrate on getting the moves right. The choreography is interesting, and looks nice. She really knows how to put together an effective and beautiful workout. Many of the moves look easier than  they are, but however are doable, and Kari Anderson explains modifications for different levels for some of the exercises.There's something very elegant and pleasant about Kari Anderson.People who like exercises which need to be done with thought and control will like this. I think this would be a pretty good workout for beginners (or near-beginners) to intermediate level. For advanced levels, it might be beneficial to do this workout and test out areas which the regular workouts might have missed - eg runners/ joggers may like to try this to improve balance and control strength.I tried this out and saw physical changes in less than 3 weeks - slimmer waist, hips, thighs, higher abs definition: -Three times of REACH (this workout by Kari Anderson)One time of Athletes Intense Stretch (Miranda Esmonde White)Two times of Full Body Workout (Miranda Esmonde White)One time of Sante Fe StretchTwo times of Total Body Cardio - Slim Sculpt Stretch (GAIAM)Of the lot, REACH is the most challenging - though not MUCH more challenging, all the workouts are great - and I bought Kari Anderson's Angles Lines and Curves II recently.",5,Workout that Delivers,1249603200,"08 7, 2009",2009,1715,"['Excellent', 'workout', 'toning', 'flexibility', 'balance', 'might', 'test', 'flexibility', 'people', 'Kari', 'Anderson', 'viewers', 'not', 'push', 'bodies', 'limits', 'segment', 'beginning', 'where', 'principles', 'workout', 'useful', 'know', 'what', 'bear', 'mind', 'workout', 'her.The', 'moves', 'are', 'relatively', 'simple', 'can', 'concentrate', 'getting', 'moves', 'right', 'choreography', 'interesting', 'nice', 'really', 'how', 'put', 'together', 'effective', 'beautiful', 'workout', 'Many', 'moves', 'look', 'easier', 'are', 'however', 'are', 'doable', 'Kari', 'Anderson', 'modifications', 'different', 'levels', 'something', 'very', 'elegant', 'pleasant', 'Kari', 'Anderson.People', 'who', 'like', 'exercises', 'need', 'be', 'done', 'thought', 'control', 'will', 'like', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'workout', 'beginners', 'near-beginners', 'intermediate', 'level', 'advanced', 'levels', 'might', 'be', 'beneficial', 'do', 'workout', 'test', 'out', 'areas', 'regular', 'workouts', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'eg', 'runners/', 'joggers', 'may', 'like', 'try', 'improve', 'balance', 'control', 'strength.I', 'tried', 'out', 'saw', 'physical', 'changes', 'less', '3', 'weeks', 'slimmer', 'waist', 'hips', 'thighs', 'higher', 'abs', 'definition', '-Three', 'times', 'REACH', 'workout', 'Kari', 'Anderson', 'One', 'time', 'Athletes', 'Intense', 'Stretch', 'Miranda', 'Esmonde', 'White', 'Two', 'times', 'Full', 'Body', 'Workout', 'Miranda', 'Esmonde', 'White', 'One', 'time', 'Sante', 'Fe', 'StretchTwo', 'times', 'Total', 'Body', 'Cardio', 'Slim', 'Sculpt', 'Stretch', 'GAIAM', 'lot', 'REACH', 'most', 'challenging', 'not', 'MUCH', 'more', 'challenging', 'workouts', 'are', 'great', 'bought', 'Kari', 'Anderson', 'Angles', 'Lines', 'Curves', 'II', 'recently']",Kari Anderson: Reach - Upbeat Toning & Flexibility for a Dancer's Body

972439,ACXF3T3I60ZK0,B000EGDN68,"Karina Abernathy ""Glitzy""","[5, 5]","This is the results I want from Winsor Pilates.  Before pregnancy I litteraly weighed 100 pounds and was tight and toned everywhere so Winsor Pilates seemed to work.  After pregnancy I can't get away from the 140 lb mark.  What I have realized is that Winsor Pilates was helping me maintain my cute girly figure but now that I want to loose weight it isn't helping.  REACH is helping with actual weightloss and reshaping my body.My exercise type ( as far as videos go) is pilates, ballet, power yoga, etc.  I don't like jumping all over the place, boot camps, kick boxing, etc.  I like to stretch and feel my body reshaping.  I have tried lots of dancing videos like Dancing with the stars, belly dancing, and more but I just don't like them.  I don't feel like I get a great workout because I can't get the moves down.  With REACH, I feel the stretching AND I actually work up a sweat.  I like the instructor.  She looks like her body comes from what she is trying to teach you to do.  I like that the video can be done in 3 different segments.  I can't do the first 2 together. By the time I finish the first one I am ready to stop.  If someone was holding a gun to my head or offering me tons of money to do the entire thing at once I could manage, but without those senerios I don't want to do it.  I am ready to stop after the first half of an hour.I do have the same complaints though as other reviewers.  There are some exercises that you need to see what she is doing, but you can't look at the tv and her at the same time.  I guess once you really learn it that won't be an issue.  I don't consider this workout fun, but it isn't boring either.  It is motivating for me because I can see how you really can reshape the body and loose weight.  I think it is something that you will really want to rotate into your regime, but I don't think you will really want to do it everyday or you may get bored.  You do feel really good afterwards.

972444,A1T6VABQU7RBMA,B000EGDN68,T. Carr,"[13, 14]","I have been dancing for over 20 years, dancing 15+ hours per week when in my prime, and typically find most workout videos (especially those that are dance based) boring. They're either too simple physically, not giving me the amount of stretch or strengthening work I desire, or they're too easy mentally (no challenge in picking up the choreography). Kari Anderson is PERFECT for trained dancers. And she's the only instructor I've found so far that I can say that about. I picked up this dvd after remembering being impressed by her VHS DanceWorks with the Pacific Northwest Ballet company. While this particular dvd doesn't focus as much on cardio or choreography it has great strengthening and stretching exercises and I definitely work up a sweat. They're much more dance based than other instructors' dvds, making the exercises easy to recognize for a dancer. It feels like a good warmup before your typical dance class. So long as you push yourself to your fullest potential I would find it very difficult to believe that even the most experienced dancers do not get something out of this.In all of my talk about it being a great workout for dancers I hope I do not discourage non-dancers! It is definitely something that advanced beginners or those looking for a challenge could pick up and do. I focused more on dancers here because I know that when I'm searching for new exercise dvds I'm always looking (usually in vain) for reviews from dancers to get their take on it. But one of the best things about Kari Anderson's exercises is that they really are for (pretty much) all levels. The difference is in how far you push yourself (how high your leg goes, how long you hold it up there, how much you resist on the way down, etc.). She is encouraging throughout and I can not recommend this dvd enough for a great, full body workout.",5,THE workout for trained dancers,1298851200,"02 28, 2011",2011,1844,"['have', 'been', 'dancing', '20', 'years', 'dancing', '15+', 'hours', 'week', 'when', 'prime', 'typically', 'find', 'most', 'workout', 'videos', 'especially', 'are', 'dance', 'based', 'boring', ""'re"", 'too', 'simple', 'physically', 'not', 'giving', 'amount', 'stretch', 'strengthening', 'work', 'desire', ""'re"", 'too', 'easy', 'mentally', 'challenge', 'picking', 'up', 'choreography', 'Kari', 'Anderson', 'PERFECT', 'trained', 'dancers', 'only', 'instructor', ""'ve"", 'found', 'so', 'far', 'can', 'say', 'picked', 'up', 'dvd', 'remembering', 'being', 'impressed', 'VHS', 'DanceWorks', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'Ballet', 'company', 'particular', 'dvd', ""n't"", 'focus', 'as', 'much', 'cardio', 'choreography', 'great', 'strengthening', 'stretching', 'exercises', 'definitely', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', ""'re"", 'much', 'more', 'dance', 'based', 'other', 'instructors', 'dvds', 'making', 'exercises', 'easy', 'recognize', 'dancer', 'good', 'warmup', 'typical', 'dance', 'class', 'So', 'long', 'push', 'fullest', 'potential', 'would', 'find', 'very', 'difficult', 'believe', 'even', 'most', 'experienced', 'dancers', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'something', 'this.In', 'talk', 'being', 'great', 'workout', 'dancers', 'hope', 'do', 'not', 'discourage', 'non-dancers', 'definitely', 'something', 'advanced', 'beginners', 'looking', 'challenge', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'do', 'focused', 'more', 'dancers', 'here', 'know', 'when', ""'m"", 'searching', 'new', 'exercise', 'dvds', ""'m"", 'always', 'looking', 'usually', 'vain', 'reviews', 'dancers', 'get', 'take', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'Kari', 'Anderson', 'exercises', 'really', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'levels', 'difference', 'how', 'far', 'push', 'how', 'high', 'leg', 'how', 'long', 'hold', 'there', 'how', 'much', 'resist', 'way', 'down', 'etc.', 'encouraging', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'enough', 'great', 'full', 'body', 'workout']",Kari Anderson: Reach - Upbeat Toning & Flexibility for a Dancer's Body

She has 5 women behind her, one an older woman all in average to very good shape. The music is good & fast, usual aerobics synthezier, but doess't bother me at all & I'm picky about music.The workout is killer, said to be for intermediate to advanced. She doesn't let you cool down between exercises in this entire 60 min session. You need some good muscles for leg lifts, deep squats or holding your body on 1 hand & leg or so.I don't normally like plain aerobics, but since each of all the exercises have an obvious benefit like stretching, toning/strengthening, balance & most do more then 2 of these or more at once & all done fast-paced with many different movements, you can't not like it. She is also great about body awareness... she knows what feels good, what the body needs next to balance out.Collagevideo com has a trailer for this & good description:These routines have the grace of ballet and the intensity of ""hard core"" body sculpting. After a flowing, rhythmic warm-up, you'll move into the dance-inspired standing toning. Examples: a squat becomes a relev&eacute;. Or a pli&eacute; becomes an extended-leg pli&eacute;, which then rotates (so the entire sequence almost seems ""choreographed""). The floor section is also unique - a blend of yoga, Pilates and traditional toning (e.g. a downward dog transitions into a plank; that plank turns into a ""side plank"" and it all evolves into a push-up).",5,"Killer toning, yoga, ballet-inspired, stretching workout",1156118400,"08 21, 2006",2006,1486,"['set', 'very', 'spacious', 'stage', 'w/modern/minimal', 'simple', 'background', '5', 'women', 'one', 'older', 'woman', 'average', 'very', 'good', 'shape', 'music', 'good', 'fast', 'usual', 'aerobics', 'synthezier', 'bother', ""'m"", 'picky', 'music.The', 'workout', 'killer', 'said', 'be', 'intermediate', 'advanced', ""n't"", 'let', 'cool', 'down', 'exercises', 'entire', '60', 'min', 'session', 'need', 'good', 'muscles', 'leg', 'lifts', 'deep', 'squats', 'holding', 'body', '1', 'hand', 'leg', 'so.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'like', 'plain', 'aerobics', 'exercises', 'have', 'obvious', 'benefit', 'stretching', 'toning/strengthening', 'balance', 'most', 'do', 'more', 'then', '2', 'more', 'once', 'done', 'fast-paced', 'many', 'different', 'movements', 'ca', ""n't"", 'not', 'also', 'great', 'body', 'awareness', 'what', 'good', 'what', 'body', 'next', 'balance', 'out.Collagevideo', 'com', 'trailer', 'good', 'description', 'routines', 'have', 'grace', 'ballet', 'intensity', 'hard', 'core', 'body', 'sculpting', 'flowing', 'rhythmic', 'warm-up', ""'ll"", 'move', 'dance-inspired', 'standing', 'toning', 'Examples', 'squat', 'relev', 'eacute', 'pli', 'eacute', 'extended-leg', 'pli', 'eacute', 'then', 'entire', 'sequence', 'almost', 'choreographed', 'floor', 'section', 'also', 'unique', 'blend', 'yoga', 'Pilates', 'traditional', 'toning', 'e.g', 'downward', 'dog', 'transitions', 'plank', 'plank', 'side', 'plank', 'push-up']",Kari Anderson: Reach - Upbeat Toning & Flexibility for a Dancer's Body
