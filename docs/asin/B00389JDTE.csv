1330262,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B00389JDTE,Israel Drazin,"[1, 1]",This is a grade B film that moves at turtle pace with heavy-handed acting.  The plot line sounds good but it is carried out weakly. Jesse James has been shot and is laid up. His brother Frank refuses to split the heist of a robbery until Jesse is well. The three members of their gang want their share and want both brothers dead so that they would no longer be chased by marshals. A woman tries to talk Jesse into giving up his criminal carrier. A marshal tries to arrest Jesse. Frank buys a woman from a man who is mistreating her.,2,Slow moving with heavyhand acting,1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,533,"['grade', 'B', 'film', 'turtle', 'pace', 'heavy-handed', 'acting', 'plot', 'line', 'good', 'carried', 'out', 'weakly', 'Jesse', 'James', 'been', 'shot', 'laid', 'up', 'brother', 'Frank', 'split', 'heist', 'robbery', 'Jesse', 'well', 'three', 'members', 'gang', 'want', 'share', 'want', 'brothers', 'dead', 'so', 'would', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'chased', 'marshals', 'woman', 'talk', 'Jesse', 'giving', 'up', 'criminal', 'carrier', 'marshal', 'tries', 'arrest', 'Jesse', 'Frank', 'woman', 'man', 'who', 'mistreating']",N/A

1330266,A3SOD5J32B1R59,B00389JDTE,V. R. Padgett,"[0, 0]","Engaging portrayal of the James brothers. As the story progressed, I became more and more involved with Jesse and Frank.Fred Olen Ray placed some good writing into his film.Note near the beginning where Deputy Burdett gives the reasons the James brothers, and the people who lived there in general, were hostile to the Federals. One of the best scenes, and again, good writing, was when Mary`s husband tries to swap her to Frank for his horse (!).I liked Patrick Gorman in Gettysburg, and in Gods and Generals. He was great as John Bell Hood and is equally good here.I enjoyed the display of various revolvers, and it is nice to see more than just the usual 1873 Colt Peacemaker-- All the firearms seemed accurate, if the film took place after 1872--- there were a few Peacemakers and I enjoyed the variety: Schofield Smith and Wesson .45; 1860 Colt Army Conversion (Allan?); Remington .44 model 1858.Weakest scene was the surgery scene!
