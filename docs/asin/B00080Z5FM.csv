897274,A2B7SS9OH87HLR,B00080Z5FM,Boston Reader,"[2, 2]","This was Jerry Orbach's first year as Detective Lennie Briscoe. My wish is that when I first saw the episode Point of View, that is would've been my first time meeting Detective Briscoe as he stepped through the steam, placing his gold detective's shield on his front jacket pocket, his shirt without a tie. He teases the personnel of the Crime Scene Unit as he wearily walks over to talk to the patrol officers who responded, noticing (PDR)powder donuts residue on the officer's blue shirt. The episodes were strong and centered around some of the most powerful issues. From used pacemakers to the death of a gay police officer. From the assassination of a civil rights leader to a computer hacker spreading a computer into a hospital computer. Some of the episodes include ""Conspiracy,"" ""Self Defense,"" ""Prince of Darkness,"" ""Point of View,"" ""Mandhood"" and ""Benevolence."" This was also Paul Sorvino's last episode as Sergeant Phil Cerreta. People involved in this season include Rene Balcer, Micheal S. Chernuchin, Walon Green, Robert Nathan, Ed Zuckerman, Ed Sherin, William N. Fordes, among other producers/writers well known in the franchise. Season three is a must have all fans of everything Law & Order, for it was the season that premiered the episode that introduced us to Detective Lennie Briscoe for the first time. This was the season where Jerry Orbach finally made it into the main cast of the show after years trying and the beginning of the Briscoe/Logan partnership.",5,Ladies and Gentlemen...

With an additional 4 Golden Globe nominations for Best TV Series (Drama), Law & Order is more than a TV show, it's a lucrative franchise for host network NBC, spawning popular spin-offs Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999), Law & Order: Criminal Intent (2001), and (the now cancelled) Law & Order: Trial By Jury (2005). Filmed on location in New York City, the show is the brainchild of creator Dick Wolf, a longtime writer for successful TV series such as Hill Street Blues and Miami Vice. With sixteen successful seasons already on the books, and more on the way, Law & Order remains one of the best drama series available on any network...Law & Order centers around the New York City criminal justice system, where ""the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups - the police who investigate crime, and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders"". The first half of each one-hour episode is dedicated to the initial revelation of a crime and the police investigation that subsequently takes place. This usually involves interviewing witnesses, following leads, testing evidence, and/or hammering out a confession. Once sufficient evidence has been gathered to charge a suspect, the remainder of the show revolves around the district attorney's office and their attempts to prosecute the offenders. Oftentimes, the audience will be witness to unexpected plot twists, unorthodox media-driven cases, or last minute, Perry Mason-like confessions or brokered deals. Given its long TV run, the cast of Law & Order has frequently changed over the years - with only a handful of characters experiencing lengthy runs, characters such as Det. Lennie Briscoe (Jerry Orbach), Lt. Anita Van Buren (S. Epatha Merkerson), and EADA John ""Jack"" McCoy (Sam Waterston)...The Law & Order (Season 3) DVD features a number of dramatic episodes including the season premiere ""Skin Deep"" in which the murder of a sleazy photographer is the main subject of investigation. But as the investigation proceeds, it seems more and more likely that the prime suspects are the models he often photographed... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Self Defense"" in which the prosecution is divided when a store owner shoots two robbers and claims self-defense as justification, and ""Conduct Unbecoming"" in which the NYPD is forced to investigate on the closed turf of the Navy in order to solve the death of a female Naval officer during a party at a Manhattan hotel...Below is a list of episodes included on the Law & Order (Season 3) DVD:Episode 45 (Skin Deep)Episode 46 (Conspiracy)Episode 47 (Forgiveness)Episode 48 (The Corporate Veil)Episode 49 (Wedded Bliss)Episode 50 (Helpless)Episode 51 (Self Defense)Episode 52 (Prince of Darkness)Episode 53 (Point of View)Episode 54 (Consultation)Episode 55 (Extended Family)Episode 56 (Right to Counsel)Episode 57 (Night and Fog)Episode 58 (Promises to Keep)Episode 59 (Mother Love)Episode 60 (Jurisdiction)Episode 61 (Conduct Unbecoming)Episode 62 (Animal Instinct)Episode 63 (Virus)Episode 64 (Securitate)Episode 65 (Manhood)Episode 66 (Benevolence)The DVD Report",5,One of the best-written shows on TV...!,1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,3296,"['Nominated', '52', 'Emmys', '1990', 'premiere', 'including', '11', 'Outstanding', 'Drama', 'Series', 'Law', 'Order', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'television', 'shows', 'modern', 'day', 'history', 'additional', '4', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nominations', 'Best', 'TV', 'Series', 'Drama', 'Law', 'Order', 'more', 'TV', 'show', 'lucrative', 'franchise', 'host', 'network', 'NBC', 'spawning', 'popular', 'spin-offs', 'Law', 'Order', 'Special', 'Victims', 'Unit', '1999', 'Law', 'Order', 'Criminal', 'Intent', '2001', 'now', 'cancelled', 'Law', 'Order', 'Trial', 'Jury', '2005', 'Filmed', 'location', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'show', 'brainchild', 'creator', 'Dick', 'Wolf', 'longtime', 'writer', 'successful', 'TV', 'series', 'such', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'sixteen', 'successful', 'seasons', 'already', 'books', 'more', 'way', 'Law', 'Order', 'one', 'best', 'drama', 'series', 'available', 'network', 'Law', 'Order', 'centers', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'represented', 'two', 'separate', 'yet', 'equally', 'important', 'groups', 'police', 'who', 'investigate', 'crime', 'district', 'attorneys', 'who', 'prosecute', 'offenders', 'first', 'half', 'one-hour', 'episode', 'dedicated', 'initial', 'revelation', 'crime', 'police', 'investigation', 'subsequently', 'place', 'usually', 'interviewing', 'witnesses', 'following', 'leads', 'testing', 'evidence', 'and/or', 'hammering', 'out', 'confession', 'Once', 'sufficient', 'evidence', 'been', 'gathered', 'charge', 'suspect', 'remainder', 'show', 'district', 'attorney', 'office', 'attempts', 'prosecute', 'offenders', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'witness', 'unexpected', 'plot', 'twists', 'unorthodox', 'media-driven', 'cases', 'last', 'minute', 'Perry', 'Mason-like', 'confessions', 'brokered', 'deals', 'Given', 'long', 'TV', 'run', 'cast', 'Law', 'Order', 'frequently', 'changed', 'years', 'only', 'handful', 'characters', 'experiencing', 'lengthy', 'runs', 'characters', 'such', 'Det', 'Lennie', 'Briscoe', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'Lt.', 'Anita', 'Van', 'Buren', 'S.', 'Epatha', 'Merkerson', 'EADA', 'John', 'Jack', 'McCoy', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'Law', 'Order', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'number', 'dramatic', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Skin', 'Deep', 'murder', 'sleazy', 'photographer', 'main', 'subject', 'investigation', 'investigation', 'proceeds', 'more', 'more', 'likely', 'prime', 'suspects', 'are', 'models', 'often', 'photographed', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', 'include', 'Self', 'Defense', 'prosecution', 'divided', 'when', 'store', 'owner', 'shoots', 'two', 'robbers', 'claims', 'self-defense', 'justification', 'Conduct', 'Unbecoming', 'NYPD', 'forced', 'investigate', 'closed', 'turf', 'Navy', 'order', 'solve', 'death', 'female', 'Naval', 'officer', 'party', 'Manhattan', 'hotel', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Law', 'Order', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'Episode', '45', 'Skin', 'Deep', 'Episode', '46', 'Conspiracy', 'Episode', '47', 'Forgiveness', 'Episode', '48', 'Corporate', 'Veil', 'Episode', '49', 'Wedded', 'Bliss', 'Episode', '50', 'Helpless', 'Episode', '51', 'Self', 'Defense', 'Episode', '52', 'Prince', 'Darkness', 'Episode', '53', 'Point', 'View', 'Episode', '54', 'Consultation', 'Episode', '55', 'Extended', 'Family', 'Episode', '56', 'Right', 'Counsel', 'Episode', '57', 'Night', 'Fog', 'Episode', '58', 'Promises', 'Keep', 'Episode', '59', 'Mother', 'Love', 'Episode', '60', 'Jurisdiction', 'Episode', '61', 'Conduct', 'Unbecoming', 'Episode', '62', 'Animal', 'Instinct', 'Episode', '63', 'Virus', 'Episode', '64', 'Securitate', 'Episode', '65', 'Manhood', 'Episode', '66', 'Benevolence', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A
897276,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B00080Z5FM,calvinnme,"[3, 3]","The third season of Law and Order is the final season of what has been called ""The Boys Club"" version of the show in which all six leading characters are men. Of course, the highlight of the season is when Jerry Orbach takes on the role of Detective Lenny Briscoe after Phil Ceretta (Paul Sorvino) is badly wounded in episode eight. The real reason for Sorvino's departure was that he believed the exposure to the cold New York City winters while shooting on location was damaging his singing voice, and so he chose to be written out of the script. Orbach would come to define the role of older cop during his twelve year tenure, and when he left in 2004 he was irreplaceable. In my opinion, his departure marked a downward spiral for the show from which it has not been able to recover. Who could replace Briscoe who, despite his tragic past of alcoholism, failed marriages, and estranged daughters, met life with a sense of humor as signified in his trademark one-liners and wisecracks?Among the stand-out episodes is ""Helpless"" in which Elizabeth Olivet takes a rare lead in the story. When she suspects a gynecologist of rape, she poses as a patient to investigate but winds up being attacked instead. She presses charges, but it makes matters difficult for Stone when he learns she tape-recorded the crime. In the end, Stone allows the doctor's giant ego and inability to stay away from the TV cameras declaring his innocence to hang him. The news broadcast of the doctor's arrogant press conference causes dozens of women who have been victimized by the doctor to call the D.A. and come forward with their own accusations. There is a continuation of this story in ""Point of View"" in which a woman is on trial for killing a man she claims raped her. Olivet interviews the woman and believes her, so she is called by the defense to testify on her behalf. Stone, therefore, must bring up Olivet's recent rape when he cross-examines her in order to discredit her testimony, insinuating that as a rape victim she would tend to believe and sympathize with any woman who claimed she had been raped herself. In the end, it turns out the woman was just carrying out a paid hit - there was no rape. Thus, Stone and Olivet ultimately make peace, when Olivet tells Stone ""Sometimes you have an awful way of being right.""""Point of View"" is also the episode that marks the first appearance of Lenny Briscoe. It's rough going between Logan and Briscoe at first. Briscoe comments on Logan's jinx: his previous two partners (Greevey and Cerreta) were shot. Down at the precinct, Logan gets mad at Briscoe for using Cerreta's desk. Meanwhile, Briscoe casually throws around a few ethnic slurs and says that Irish people often kill for money (Logan is Irish). Logan asks Cragen when Cerreta is going to return, but of course, that doesn't look like it's going to happen.One of the first Law and Order episodes involving computer crime is ""Virus"" in which two patients die and several become critically ill after being administered incorrect dosages of insulin at a clinic that specializes in diabetes. A discussion with a technician leads to evidence that a computer virus has infected the hospital's computer network, and the virus was uploaded via a person dialing in to to the network. A suspect and a motive are uncovered for the crime: the suspect's paranoid dad thinks he was blinded by the clinic, so they figure his son wanted revenge. Stone takes this to the judge, but no dice. So Stone decides to go after the father for conspiracy, hoping he can prove the father had knowledge of his son's intentions, and that, as Schiff says, the son will ""get a case of the guilts"" and confess, which he does. This might be the earliest incident of technophobia in Law & Order history, and it is an annoying recurrent theme during the first five years of the show. Not until a more techno-savvy Curtis joins the force in 1995 does Law and Order ever talk about any of the good things that computers can do. Castwise, the episode is notable because Leslie Hendrix makes an early appearance as the medical examiner Rodgers.One thing that was troublesome was the unexplained departure of ADA Robinette and Captain Cregan at the end of this season.

These themes are the foundation for Dick Wolf's long-running TV show. Like Lumet's police procedure movies, Law and Order takes a just-the-facts approach. We are given no to very little details about the characters' private lives. The show also utilizes gritty, New York City locales filled with tough cops, down-on-their-luck losers and cocky lawyers. Each episode feels like an hour-long version of such Lumet films as Prince of the City or Q & A.Law and Order is the no frills alternative to NYPD Blue which tended to dwell as much on the detectives' personal lives as it did on the actual cases. Law and Order jettisons the interpersonal relationships in favour of also showing what happens to suspects once they go to court. This offers a more balanced view of our law enforcement and justice system that most other shows do not provide. There is something addictive about this show that sucks you in as you're watching an episode and pretty soon you've watched a whole bunch of them. Season three is a good snap-shot of the show in its prime and once Jerry Orbach joined the cast it got even better.There are eight deleted scenes for six episodes that don't really contain anything all that memorable except for the occasional bit of business between characters.""Jerry Orbach Tribute"" is a way-too brief celebration of the late-great actor. Considering how important Orbach was to the success of the show it is rather disappointing the brevity of this extra.""Jerry Orbach Profile"" offers a look at the actor in his natural environment: working on the show.

897284,A3R56AWX8PRQLP,B00080Z5FM,Indy Reviewer,"[58, 59]","Law and Order's third season is the beginning of the golden years of the show, six or seven seasons in which this became one of the best crime shows ever.  Part of it is the plots, but a larger part is the addition of Jerry Orbach to add both character and humor to a narrowly written role.  The show itself is 5 stars, but I knock off a star for yet another season in which the transfers and extras leave something to be desired.  Still, very much worth buying.What makes this season golden?  Nostalgia for the early 1990s helps, with big hair, Times Square full of strip clubs, crime labs using old IBM 386 computers, colored shirts and narrow ties, and a general feeling that a far more gritty New York made a better backdrop for a crime show than today's sanitized version.Some of it is the writing and source material.  Episodes include the standard ripped-from-the-headlines stories - Tailhook (Conduct Unbecoming), sweatshop workers (Wedded Bliss), doctors assaulting patients (Helpless, Promises to Keep), drug smuggling rings (Consultation), hackers (Virus) - but one reason the first few seasons are more robust is that they had just started to scratch the surface of historical crimes, like a restaging of the Malcolm X murder (Conspiracy) and a medical device company scandal (The Corporate Veil).  This means that while the bang-bang plot advancement really comes into its own this season after a couple of years of slower episodes, the writers don't have to resort to cheap plot tricks to keep things interesting.  Routine false leads and judges throwing out evidence every episode can wait for the formulaic later years.  I also particularly like several of the non-Hollywood endings, like Prince of Darkness (""What happened to the little girl?"" ""She was picked up at school by her uncle.""  ""She doesn't have an uncle."")But a larger part is the acting.  With the mid-season addition of Orbach - who plays first-year Briscoe a bit more troubled and edgy than in later years - the Law side of the series finally has two actors that don't think that playing an NYPD detective is beneath their talent.  Briscoe's trademark wisecrack helps (""They brought the hookers in?  I thought they were on the room service menu""), but there's a chemistry between Orbach and Noth that makes the makes plots come to life.  In addition, several of the regular guest stars (Tovah Feldshuh and Lorraine Toussant as memorable defense attorneys, Leslie Hendrix's first appearances as the irascible medical examiner) add life to the show in their brief roles.  Finally, one fun part of watching the early years are the stars who have gone on to bigger careers: Claire Danes, Edie Falco, Sam Rockwell, Gloria Foster (the oracle from the Matrix), Desperate Housewife Felicity Huffman, Alias' Ron Rifkin, ER's Paul McCrane and Julianna Margulies.As I have for the first two season sets, I take a star off for transfers and extras that aren't up to the quality of the show. I have mixed opinions about cheaply producing double sided DVDs in three slim cases without any written material, but at least it takes less space on my shelf.  Transfer quality is in fact better than the first two seasons, but it's clear remastering was cursory as there is still periodic flecking.  After no extras in the first two seasons, at least this set includes some.  However, they're still disappointing especially after the long delay in putting this out.  The 8 deleted scenes don't add much, although we finally see one of Briscoe's brassy middle aged girlfriends (for the only time in the series!)  A five minute interview with and six minute tribute to Orbach by fellow stars doesn't even include the master of ceremonies of his celebration, Sam Waterston; they would have been better served just putting a copy of that on the DVD instead of getting Trial By Jury actors on the profound effect his 4 episodes with them had on their careers.  What the series really needs is interviews with writers and actors on the various episodes.  At least they don't include an ad as they did in the first year.However, this is very much worth picking up for Law and Order fans.  I just wish if Universal is going to price something at a premium that viewers can watch for free on basic cable, they'd at least add premium content.

I have single-sided discs from the complete set of 20 seasons. Individual seasons were created on double-sided discs and sold separately. There may be some differences in quality because of that. This season has the gritty settings of the early years, the technology that, by today's standards, seems almost juvenile, and other details that strike a quaint note, like saying El You Dees instead of LUDS as is done in later years. The writing is excellent and plenty of the stories were, indeed, ripped from the headlines and given unique spins. The casting is generally excellent and part of the enjoyment was spotting actors who showed up on other Law & Order episodes and on the Law & Order spin-offs. The best part of the season was the introduction of Jerry Ohrbach as Det. Lennie Briscoe, the somewhat sarcastic detective who initially rubs against Det. Mike Logan (Chris Noth).

897293,AK7IDQJN31163,B00080Z5FM,Ryan,"[8, 9]","Other reviewers are right on when they say that the arrival of Jerry Orbach as the sardonic Det. Lenny Briscoe is what cemented this already great show as a winner. But viewing later seasons of the show proves that Orbach was at his best when playing off of his then partner, Mike Logan (Chris Noth). The chemistry between Briscoe and Logan brought that much-needed glint of subtle characterization to a show largely haled for its plot-driven elements. Yet, the shows were never weighed down by personal baggage as was often the case in this era's contemporary cop show, NYPD Blue. Its also noteworthy that Michael Moriarty as the idealistic ADA, Ben Stone still fueled the legal side of this drama. This season would be the curtain call for Cpt. Don Cragen (Dan Florek), and ADA Paul Robinette (Richard Brooks), both of whom filled their roles well during the early run.The real staple of this show, of course, is the storytelling, which still proves itself to be more powerful and effective than anything found on the current burned-out series. Episodes like ""Manhood,"" ""Mother Love,"" ""Night and Fog,"" ""Wedded Bliss,"" and ""Promises to Keep,"" are particularly powerful. Some episodes don't always have happy or neat endings as demonstrated by the riveting, ""Conspiracy,"" in which cops and prosecutors hunt for the person who assassinates a controversial African-American leader. Some episodes also have a personal touch for the characters, including ""Helpless,"" in which police psychologist Elizabeth Olivet (Carolyn McCormick) is molested by a sadistic gynecologist. Also, ""Prince of Darkness,"" in which Logan watches his partner Phil Cerreta (Paul Sorvino) badly wounded by a drugged-out gun dealer. This is one of the darkest episodes of the entire series and would serve as the transition for Briscoe's entrance.Some criticize the extras in this box set. They are a bit meager, but Universal has never been particularly generous with extras, so I'll take anything I can get. The two short featurettes are particularly moving because of Jerry Orbach's recent passing. The deleted scenes are interesting for diehard fans, but its obvious why they were omitted from the final print. I also applaud Universal for including a ""Play All"" feature.

897295,ADZA821C0YRHQ,B00080Z5FM,Tv & Cd Reviewer,"[9, 13]",Law & Order's early seasons were really the best. In The third season you have Jerry Orbach coming into the show.All these episodes are great becuase i have seen many of them before.The Dvd is finally being released after a long wait after the 2nd season. The 15th season which is still on NBC on wedsnday is going to have a DVD release as i have heard.Also the New Law& Order Trial  By Jury is going to be out on Dvd. Law & Order and all its other series are absolutly the best,4,Its good there putting the older seasons on DVD,1115164800,"05 4, 2005",2005,478,"['Law', 'Order', 'early', 'seasons', 'were', 'really', 'best', 'third', 'season', 'have', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'coming', 'show.All', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', 'becuase', 'i', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'before.The', 'Dvd', 'finally', 'being', 'released', 'long', 'wait', '2nd', 'season', '15th', 'season', 'still', 'NBC', 'wedsnday', 'going', 'have', 'DVD', 'release', 'i', 'have', 'heard.Also', 'New', 'Law', 'Order', 'Trial', 'Jury', 'going', 'be', 'out', 'Dvd', 'Law', 'Order', 'other', 'series', 'are', 'absolutly', 'best']",N/A

897297,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00080Z5FM,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[13, 13]","I felt that ""Law and Order"" truly hit its stride in the third season. When Jerry Orbach joined the cast he added sarcasm, wit and became the series' moral anchor. I really miss him as an actor and his presence will be missed on the TV screen as well where he provided a weekly dose of professionalism, talent and always injected an element of dark wit to the series. A number of great episodes feature during this season. ""Prince of Darkness"" ""Manhood"", ""Benevolence"" are among the stand outs particularly the first where Jerry Orbach first joined the cast. An outstanding episode (one my favorites I might add) about the murder of a police officer stranded without back up suddenly becomes an issue when it turns out its related to prejudice.A vast improvement over previous sets, ""Law and Order"" looks very good here. There's still some dirt and debris but the colors are vivid and the strobing effect mentioned in some previous reviews isn't present that I can tell. The Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround Sound mix is solid with nice clarity and separation.We do get deleted scenes for a number of episodes (and we meet one of the ""middle aged dames"" that Brisco frequently hangs with in the deleted scene for ""Manhood""). We get two featurettes both built around Jerry Orbach. The first ""Jerry Orbach Profile"" features a nice interview with Orbach with he discusses his feelings about the series. He points out that he believed the series' longevity is directly related to the show's revolving cast of characters and actors. Using this approach, the series has managed to remain fresh. The tribute features actors such as Chris Noth, Dan Florek and others discussing the impact that working with Orbach had on their career and their impressions of them as a person. A couple of them are quite honest about the conflicts that occurred on set when Michael Moriarty was a member of the team and how Orbach brought a level of calm to the set with his professional demeanor and sense of humor.A great series that picked up steam and continued to get better and better, the third season found ""Law & Order"" in top form. With some additional cast changes (Sam Waterston and a few others), this series would be hitting on all cylinders. The two featurettes on Orbach are nicely done although I would have liked to see a career overview or biography that went more in depth into Orbach's background.",5,"Top notch season for ""Law and Order""",1118448000,"06 11, 2005",2005,2386,"['felt', 'Law', 'Order', 'truly', 'hit', 'stride', 'third', 'season', 'When', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'joined', 'cast', 'added', 'sarcasm', 'wit', 'became', 'series', 'moral', 'anchor', 'really', 'miss', 'actor', 'presence', 'will', 'be', 'missed', 'TV', 'screen', 'as', 'well', 'where', 'provided', 'weekly', 'dose', 'professionalism', 'talent', 'always', 'injected', 'element', 'dark', 'wit', 'series', 'number', 'great', 'episodes', 'feature', 'season', 'Prince', 'Darkness', 'Manhood', 'Benevolence', 'are', 'stand', 'particularly', 'first', 'where', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'first', 'joined', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'episode', 'one', 'favorites', 'might', 'add', 'murder', 'police', 'officer', 'stranded', 'back', 'up', 'suddenly', 'issue', 'when', 'out', 'related', 'prejudice.A', 'vast', 'improvement', 'previous', 'sets', 'Law', 'Order', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'still', 'dirt', 'debris', 'colors', 'are', 'vivid', 'strobing', 'effect', 'mentioned', 'previous', 'reviews', ""n't"", 'present', 'can', 'tell', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'mix', 'solid', 'nice', 'clarity', 'separation.We', 'do', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'number', 'episodes', 'meet', 'one', 'middle', 'aged', 'dames', 'Brisco', 'frequently', 'deleted', 'scene', 'Manhood', 'get', 'two', 'featurettes', 'built', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'first', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'Profile', 'nice', 'interview', 'Orbach', 'feelings', 'series', 'out', 'believed', 'series', 'longevity', 'directly', 'related', 'show', 'revolving', 'cast', 'characters', 'actors', 'Using', 'approach', 'series', 'managed', 'remain', 'fresh', 'tribute', 'actors', 'such', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'Dan', 'Florek', 'others', 'discussing', 'impact', 'working', 'Orbach', 'had', 'career', 'impressions', 'person', 'couple', 'are', 'quite', 'honest', 'conflicts', 'occurred', 'set', 'when', 'Michael', 'Moriarty', 'was', 'member', 'team', 'how', 'Orbach', 'brought', 'level', 'calm', 'set', 'professional', 'demeanor', 'sense', 'humor.A', 'great', 'series', 'picked', 'up', 'steam', 'continued', 'get', 'better', 'better', 'third', 'season', 'found', 'Law', 'Order', 'top', 'form', 'additional', 'cast', 'changes', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'few', 'others', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'hitting', 'cylinders', 'two', 'featurettes', 'Orbach', 'are', 'nicely', 'done', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'career', 'overview', 'biography', 'went', 'more', 'depth', 'Orbach', 'background']",N/A
