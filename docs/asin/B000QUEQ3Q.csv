It shows fighters from many disciplines such as jiu-jitsu, wrestling, karate, tae-kwondo, kick boxing, sumo, etc. The fighters are the cream of their groups.The fighting scenes look realistic, exciting and scaring too when somebody got seriously hurt.This showed that in real life, fighter with good submission skills usually win in a non-armed fighting. This DVD is a must-have for action fans.I bought it from Walmart for only 26 dollars. I can't go wrong with that.",5,The BEST that MY MONEY CAN GET.,1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,556,"['BEST', 'MY', 'MONEY', 'CAN', 'GET', 'terms', 'realistic', 'fighting', 'diversity', 'excitment', 'fighters', 'many', 'disciplines', 'such', 'jiu-jitsu', 'wrestling', 'karate', 'tae-kwondo', 'kick', 'boxing', 'sumo', 'etc', 'fighters', 'are', 'cream', 'groups.The', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'look', 'realistic', 'exciting', 'scaring', 'too', 'when', 'somebody', 'got', 'seriously', 'hurt.This', 'showed', 'real', 'life', 'fighter', 'good', 'submission', 'skills', 'usually', 'win', 'non-armed', 'fighting', 'DVD', 'must-have', 'action', 'fans.I', 'bought', 'Walmart', 'only', '26', 'dollars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong']",Ufc sac Gft

There were allot fewer rules and no weight classes, and the fighters were masters of their own disciplines. I liked seeing a master of jiu jitsu face off against a master of kickboxing. Today nobody really has a single discipline (they are all mixed martial artist). That is really the huge difference that you will see. The old tournaments featured men, who had dedicated their life to their craft and were true masters of their discipline. Case in point, Royce Gracie is better at Jiu Jitsu than any current MMA fighter, but he also isn't as well rounded as todays fighters, who are well versed in multiple fighting styles.I also liked how these original tournaments addressed age old questions, such as which fighting discipline is the best, or can a David really beat a Goliath? I also like the classic way the tournament was run. 8 fighters began and winning fighters would advance to the next round to face each other until only one man was left standing as champion.Yes, I agree that today's fighters are probably better than the ones you will see in these old tournaments, but these guys laid the ground work.",5,UFC in the 1990's,1210204800,"05 8, 2008",2008,1232,"['still', 'remember', 'when', 'first', 'purchased', 'UFC', '3', 'VHS', '90', 'was', 'so', 'fresh', 'underground', 'controversial', 'were', 'allot', 'fewer', 'rules', 'weight', 'classes', 'fighters', 'were', 'masters', 'own', 'disciplines', 'liked', 'seeing', 'master', 'jiu', 'jitsu', 'face', 'off', 'master', 'kickboxing', 'Today', 'nobody', 'really', 'single', 'discipline', 'are', 'mixed', 'martial', 'artist', 'really', 'huge', 'difference', 'will', 'see', 'old', 'tournaments', 'featured', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'dedicated', 'life', 'craft', 'were', 'true', 'masters', 'discipline', 'Case', 'point', 'Royce', 'Gracie', 'better', 'Jiu', 'Jitsu', 'current', 'MMA', 'fighter', 'also', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'rounded', 'todays', 'fighters', 'who', 'are', 'well', 'versed', 'multiple', 'fighting', 'styles.I', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'original', 'tournaments', 'addressed', 'age', 'old', 'questions', 'such', 'fighting', 'discipline', 'best', 'can', 'David', 'really', 'beat', 'Goliath', 'also', 'classic', 'way', 'tournament', 'was', 'run', '8', 'fighters', 'began', 'winning', 'fighters', 'would', 'advance', 'next', 'round', 'face', 'other', 'only', 'one', 'man', 'was', 'left', 'standing', 'champion.Yes', 'agree', 'today', 'fighters', 'are', 'probably', 'better', 'ones', 'will', 'see', 'old', 'tournaments', 'guys', 'laid', 'ground', 'work']",Ufc sac Gft

1077015,A1MN5ASSWF44HJ,B000QUEQ3Q,Tyler,"[3, 3]","Ah, the early days of the UFC.  Rorion Gracie wanted to live the American dream so the Gracie's used their connections to get the UFC started to promote the Gracie's Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.  Were certain people chosen over others for entry?  Was Royce protected?  Many arguments can be laid out but lets ignore those.This is the sport in it's early days (as far as the United States scene is concerned) where traditional martial arts were still the way.  Fighters practicing one discipline and trying to prove it's worth.  Eventually more and more rules would be enforced and the Gracie's would leave thinking the rules were too much.Simply put, if you appreciate MMA and it's history, you can do no wrong picking these up.  If you enjoy a spectacle you will also enjoy these.
