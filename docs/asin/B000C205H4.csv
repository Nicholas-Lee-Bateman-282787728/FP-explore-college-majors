Of course in a movie such as this that cannot possibly happen...blood IS shed and some characters do not survive.The good news is that you will have a lot of fun watching these events unfold...and also the sequel has been released just this week with the return of all surviving characters and appearences by some not so much alive characters!

954377,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000C205H4,Grady Harp,"[5, 6]","Jason Paul Collum both wrote and directed this little film that resembles a gay 'Fatal Attraction' without the benefit of a tight script, good actors, suspense, or sophisticated effects and camera work.  Sadly it boils down to a fifteen-minute story spread out over an almost interminable 2 hours.The story involves on Corin (Sean Michael Lambrecht), a 30-year old ad exec in a five-year bumpy relationship with 23-year old party boy Jake (Jeff Dylan Graham).  Corin's boss and friend Nancy (Brinke Stevens) understands Corin all too well, appreciates his relationship, but in attempting to relieve his work duties hires an assistant Elliot (Jerod Howard), a gender confused nerdy lad who is engaged to his lifelong chum Marti (Tina Ona Paukstelis) in a push from his mother (Judith O'Dea) to make things 'right'. Elliot is befriended by Corin, brought into Corin's and Jake's friendship, and Elliot and Marti and Corin and Jake begin socializing.  Elliot falls for Corin, comes out of the closet to the extreme dismay of Marti and his mother, and despite Elliot's friendship with Corin and Jake, he begins to stalk Corin.  Corin's rebuff of his advances leads to disaster and the film tumbles downhill from there.Yes, some may view this weak little foray as being full of statements about love, obsession, relationships, and friendships, but all of that has been said far better before and without the seemingly tacked on genre of a horror film.  The acting from the women in the film is good, but the men are blunted stereotypes.  Everything about the film screams low budget.  One annoying factor - a music score that sounds like lessons on electronic keyboards and obscures a lot of the dialogue - turns out to be a blessing in that the weak script is covered frequently.  Most viewers will utilize the fast forward button to get through the repetitious dialogue and race for the end, a predictable, stagy tableaux that really doesn't resolve anything.  Not worth two hours of your viewing time.

Corin's boss, Nancy (Brinke Stevens), helps out by hiring him an assistant, Elliot (Jerod Howard).  Elliot, an awkward fellow, is engaged to marry his long-time only-friend Marti (Tina Ona Paukstelis).  Corin's gaydar picks up a vibe from Elliot that triggers invitations for Elliot and Marti to spend some time with Corin and Jake.  Elliot's mother, Emily (Judith O'dea) disapproves strongly.  Nevertheless, rather rapidly, Elliot finds his real attraction is to Corin.Not having learned how to make friends, Elliot presses in, gathering souvenirs and taking secret photographs.  Eventually Nancy, Jake, and Corin do something about it, but not in time to prevent Elliot from making his sudden move.  The film moves to its violent climax, including Christian symbolism and decorated with the words of twisted journalism.This inexpensive independent film does manage to do a good job telling the story of Elliot's reorientation and decline into obsession, showing a gay couple negotiating their relationship, and having the supporting cast framing the action well.  There are scenes showing how straight bars, gay bars, and traditional religion reflect and shape values.The acting was fairly good, with Brinke, Howard, and O'Dea doing the best.The four knifing scenes all have makeup and effects that are reasonable.  The film is not centered on showing violence per se.Attractive Corin has substantial skin shots.  Jake has a background one.  There is a hunky farmer and a gay club dancer for extra eye-candy.As extras, there is an audio commentary by the director (Jason Paul Collum) and Jerod Howard, there is a small making-of featurette, some spicy photogalleries, and two trailers.""October Moon"" fills a unique niche.

I really found that I could relate to Elliot in alot of ways.  I grew up without a father, in a conservative community surrounded by homophobia.  I didn't have alot of friends in high school.  I didn't know other gay people until I was in college.  As most gay men can tell you, the coming out process can be very painful, and poor Elliot had about the worst coming out possible.  Corin, the first gay man Elliot ever met, knew immediately that Elliot was gay.  Knowing how difficult it can be, Corin wanted to help, and became friends with him.  Little did he know that his compassion and kindness toward Elliot planted a seed for Elliot to become extremely obsessed with him.  Of course Corin was already in a relationship with a guy named Jake, rocky of course, but committed to making it work.  I can relate to Elliot in this way too.  It is very painful to love someone who doesn't love you back.  Even though you knew from the start that this person is not available, you can't help who you fall for.  This was especially true for Elliot considering the circumstances that led to this point. As more time goes by, Elliot becomes more and more obsessed.  His misery is compounded when his fiance and mother discover his secret.  He is kicked out onto the street, alone, and miserable.  When I came out to my mother, I didn't get the support that I had hoped for, but at least my mother didn't reject me.  I can't even imagine how that felt for poor Elliot.  My heart ached for this poor guy.  The pain he felt from this multiple rejection quickly spiraled out of control resulting in a tragic ending.  While I don't condone his actions at the end, I somehow understand why he went down that path.I give this movie 5 stars becuase it is very rare to find a gay themed movie these days that doesn't look cheaply made with horrid acting and lame story lines.  I thought the acting was good. The picture was high quality for a low budget, and of course the storyline struck a nerve.  I loved the realistic feel to the story.
