As usual, Kane does a fantastic job of the characters that he portrays. I wasn&#8217;t expecting the &#8220;twist&#8221; at the end I was a little annoyed because I feel like there should have been a hint or two that the twist was coming. That way, you re-watch and think, &#8220;I should have seen this coming.&#8221; Instead, I&#8217;m going to have to re-watch to see if I missed something. I also realize that I would have loved to see more development between the characters and how they met. I guess it was a limited script with a limited budget so I will give it 3/5 stars, but I will say that if you&#8217;re a Kane or Miner fan then you want to see this work because it does make a hearty attempt at character driven rather than action drive writing.",3,Kane/Miner give strong performance.

I am NOT a fan of violent movies but once I pushed past that, the movie became so compelling I couldn't stop watching 'til it was over. The ending truly baffled me but I have to buy it and see it again......maybe I missed something. But since I LOVE Christian Kane and he (and the girl who plays Betty) were excellent in their portrayals in this movie, I'll watch it again--sorry, I have to say Christian is HOOOTTT in this movie--that doesn't hurt it a bit (he's the reason I watched in the first place). LOLOh and one more thing: being a Christian (the religion, not CK--lol) the fanaticism portrayed in this movie, while it does happen, is not the reality for ALL believers. I AM a child of God but I would certainly not torment someone with the insanity that was done here! It was sooo ... again, I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone, so I'm stopping there but I'm stepping on to my soapbox and saying please don't believe because one did it in the name of the Lord, ALL DO IT.

Or is this just how the latte-slurping, hip California wealthy execs see the rest of America?  I'm not sure.But plenty of criminal posturing and redneck grunting is on display in HIDE, along with disturbing unexplained shots of torture and mutilation that will leave you turning your head and then scratching your head until the very end.I think I know what happens.  But I don't want to spoil anything for anyone so I may put my interpretation in the Comments section.  So, if you click on my Comments (unless you're making one), you'll find the SPOILER about the ending.  Or at least what I think it was.Otherwise, I really hated all of these characters.  I don't blame the actors.  They were actually very good, although I was a little thrown by Rachel Miner's accent.  Good or bad, I couldn't tell...but I do know that I hated her character.  [...]  No actress is hot enough to overcome what an annoying, obnoxious presence this skank can be.It was also impossible to be sympathetic for the male lead.  Christian Kane, right?  He does a good job...but he's playing a sociopathic, a hateful bully.I actually thought the ending was interesting but you really have to pay attention to it.  It's a real JACOB'S LADDER kind of jump to make but the characters are so shallow and revolting that you don't care about them.  Even if the viewer made the jump to its logic, you're left with: so what, they're worthless.So, as much as I'd like to give points for its imaginative ending, I still couldn't justify watching these horrible people for everything leading up to it.The cast tries hard.
