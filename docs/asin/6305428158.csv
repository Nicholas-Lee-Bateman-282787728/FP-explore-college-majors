This movie starts out where real life left off, except that it depicts the Montana militia as murdering right-wing (naturally!) misfits instead of the more-or-less justified protesters they really were.In this one, there is a mixed message: First you have the idealistic doctor (Steven Seagal) who has left the government apparently because they were developing ""biological weapons"" (germ warfare) which he protested--a favorite theme of the ""good guys"" on the political left.  Then, you have the dirty rotten right-wing militia who have obtained a virus that is ""ten times stronger than anthrax.""  Of course, they immediately infect the whole countryside with it.Then, the right-wing radical rednecks come into town in their camos and shoot everyone in sight, trying to get the antidote for the virus which--surprise!--has also infected them.The doctor escapes with his cute little daughter (whose blood the brutes want to make an antidote) and tries to find a vaccine and save the world.Not content with the propaganda they have dished out so far, the producers then throw in a dose of the piece de resistance, the under-appreciated, misunderstood ""Native American,"" whose natural remedy saves the day.A tour de force of Hollywood liberal propaganda.

The plot is basically Steven is a local doctor in the town and he is very respected. He has a daughter maybe between the ages of 8-10. They have a little farm with horses. Now a bad guy who seemed to me like an EX millitary agent or officer turned anti american. Before he helped creat a drug that could easily wipe out an entire town within hours and the stuff is VERY deadly! Well he figures if he is going to go down, then why not take as many people down with him as possible. He puts a couple of drops on his tongue and goes to court to face his sentence. He then spits on the judge and from then on the judge passes it on and so forth. Steven is not a police officer or millitary or anything. Just a very smart doctor. Now he is called into action when the bad guy excapes from jail and goes to the hopsital and basically hold the place hostage until a cure can be found. and yes he does want it for himself and his soldiers. From  then on the story happens and comes to an end. From what I said above in the short summary there is more detail, im just going to let you watch the movie.The acting is good to me. Steven has some funny one liners here and there. And the bad guy makes a beleivable bad guy. Not just some pethetic looser who trys to be scary but fails. The supporting cast is good. Because this is a Steven Seagal film im sure EVERYONE is wanting to see some good action because he is still in shape here. You might be dissapointed. Out of 90 minutes, I would say about 10 mins of action. But I must say for the 10 mins of action it is descent enough to make you smile. The ending to me was not good at all. It seemed to ""NICE"" to me. But hey they all cant be good. The Patriot is Rated ""R"" for Strong Violence and Language. Keep in mind that this is a DTV and not a theatrical release.

The film marked Seagal's first entry into the direct-to-video market and is generally not held in high regard by fans, but for someone who doesn't mind a green message in film or toning down the action every once in a while, this is one of my personal favourites of what Seagal has to offer.The story: Wesley McClaren (Seagal) is an ex-government immunologist and physician working in a small Montana town with his daughter Holly (Camilla Belle,10,000 B.C.) and loyal farmhand Frank (L.Q. Jones,A Prairie Home Companion). When Floyd Chisolm (Gailard Sartain,Ernest Goes to Jail) - a self-described patriot and leader of a paramilitary militia - unleashes a devastating virus upon the population of the town and topples an intervening response team, Wesley must flee to a secluded military testing facility to engineer an antidote to the virus before it's too late for his fellow townspeople.For all non-canon purposes, ""The Patriot"" could be the third instalment in Seagal's line of 'green' movies that includeOn Deadly GroundandFire Down Below. It's not as overly environmentally-themed as those other two, but the power of the earth is definitely represented. Those familiar with Seagal's filmography will realize that this type of approach calls for a reduction in the action department: flower-power is played over arm-breaking and neck-snapping (although Steven does score a nifty kill with a wine glass to the head), so for those of you who know that you won't be able to live without the violence ofOut for Justice, don't even give this one a try.Those of you who stick around, however, are treated to a direct-to-video film that's miles ahead of anything Seagal would make later in his career under the same label. First-time director Dean Semler (award-winning cinematographer for films likeDances with Wolves) manages the picture with dutiful attention to detail, and the script calls for plenty of meaningful character interaction - the kind where even bit players like ""Molly"" McClure are given an endearing personality. The cast is one of the most underrated of any Seagalian picture: Sartain, Jones, Belle, and Whitney Yellow Robe as Wesley's assistant and sister-in-law all share an enthusiasm for their roles that defies any less-than-theatrical disposition, and even Steven manages to squeeze out a little something extra for his character, especially when interacting with his daughter.Where the film's faults are concerned, the lack of Seagal's bread-and-butter moves (i.e. bone breaking) comes to weigh on even my mind, though the story is generally successful in avoiding situations where it would be overtly necessary, so the movie doesn't feel neutered. In addition, Sartain's militia-leading character is delivered sort of strangely: I can't help but think that the voice-over tidbit referring to him as neo Nazi was inserted solely because the filmmakers feared his pro-American, anti-government ideology might end up appealing to some viewers; even Seagal's character claims at one point to agree with some of his ideas, which really makes for a confusing character picture of this guy. Still, I like the movie a lot, and I'm still unsure of why so many folks really don't. I mean, who can't appreciate Seagal rocking a cowboy hat? If you ask me, any real fan of the aikido master would be daft to put any of his lesser DTV titles on their shelf before this one.",4,Doctor Seagal,1211155200,"05 19, 2008",2008,3617,"['Even', 'two', 'environmentally-charged', 'vehicles', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'done', 'eco-trip', 'following', 'project', 'was', 'self-financed', 'adaptation', 'William', 'Heine', 'post-apocalyptic', 'novelThe', 'Last', 'Canadian', 'film', 'marked', 'Seagal', 'first', 'entry', 'direct-to-video', 'market', 'generally', 'not', 'held', 'high', 'regard', 'fans', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'mind', 'green', 'message', 'film', 'toning', 'down', 'action', 'once', 'while', 'one', 'personal', 'favourites', 'what', 'Seagal', 'offer.The', 'story', 'Wesley', 'McClaren', 'Seagal', 'ex-government', 'immunologist', 'physician', 'working', 'small', 'Montana', 'town', 'daughter', 'Holly', 'Camilla', 'Belle,10,000', 'B.C', 'loyal', 'farmhand', 'Frank', 'L.Q', 'Jones', 'A', 'Prairie', 'Home', 'Companion', 'When', 'Floyd', 'Chisolm', 'Gailard', 'Sartain', 'Ernest', 'Goes', 'Jail', 'self-described', 'patriot', 'leader', 'paramilitary', 'militia', 'devastating', 'virus', 'population', 'town', 'intervening', 'response', 'team', 'Wesley', 'must', 'flee', 'secluded', 'military', 'testing', 'facility', 'engineer', 'antidote', 'virus', 'too', 'late', 'fellow', 'non-canon', 'purposes', 'Patriot', 'could', 'be', 'third', 'instalment', 'Seagal', 'line', ""'green"", 'movies', 'includeOn', 'Deadly', 'GroundandFire', 'Down', 'Below', 'not', 'overly', 'environmentally-themed', 'other', 'two', 'power', 'earth', 'definitely', 'represented', 'familiar', 'Seagal', 'filmography', 'will', 'realize', 'type', 'approach', 'calls', 'reduction', 'action', 'department', 'flower-power', 'played', 'arm-breaking', 'neck-snapping', 'Steven', 'score', 'nifty', 'kill', 'wine', 'glass', 'head', 'so', 'who', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'live', 'violence', 'ofOut', 'Justice', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'give', 'one', 'try.Those', 'who', 'stick', 'around', 'however', 'are', 'treated', 'direct-to-video', 'film', 'miles', 'ahead', 'anything', 'Seagal', 'would', 'make', 'later', 'career', 'same', 'label', 'First-time', 'director', 'Dean', 'Semler', 'award-winning', 'cinematographer', 'films', 'likeDances', 'Wolves', 'picture', 'dutiful', 'attention', 'detail', 'script', 'plenty', 'meaningful', 'character', 'interaction', 'kind', 'where', 'even', 'players', 'Molly', 'McClure', 'are', 'given', 'endearing', 'personality', 'cast', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'Seagalian', 'picture', 'Sartain', 'Jones', 'Belle', 'Whitney', 'Yellow', 'Robe', 'Wesley', 'assistant', 'sister-in-law', 'share', 'enthusiasm', 'roles', 'less-than-theatrical', 'disposition', 'even', 'Steven', 'squeeze', 'out', 'little', 'something', 'extra', 'character', 'especially', 'when', 'interacting', 'film', 'faults', 'are', 'concerned', 'lack', 'Seagal', 'bread-and-butter', 'moves', 'i.e', 'bone', 'breaking', 'weigh', 'even', 'mind', 'story', 'generally', 'successful', 'avoiding', 'situations', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'overtly', 'necessary', 'movie', ""n't"", 'feel', 'neutered', 'addition', 'Sartain', 'militia-leading', 'character', 'delivered', 'sort', 'strangely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'voice-over', 'tidbit', 'referring', 'neo', 'Nazi', 'was', 'inserted', 'solely', 'filmmakers', 'feared', 'pro-American', 'anti-government', 'ideology', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'appealing', 'viewers', 'even', 'Seagal', 'character', 'claims', 'one', 'point', 'agree', 'ideas', 'really', 'confusing', 'character', 'picture', 'guy', 'Still', 'like', 'movie', 'lot', ""'m"", 'still', 'unsure', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'folks', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'Seagal', 'rocking', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'ask', 'real', 'fan', 'aikido', 'master', 'would', 'be', 'daft', 'put', 'lesser', 'DTV', 'titles', 'shelf', 'one']",The Patriot

This flick has the same feel of both ""On Deadly Ground"", and ""Fire Down Below"" only weaker. I mean Fire Down Below was a good excuse for the dreadful On Deadly Ground...why keep re visiting similar plots.Seagal this time around plays Dr. Wesley McClaren, A local Doctor that is well respected in his town. Shortly in the film we are introduced to a Militia- Extremist; he and his men want to teach the government a lesson. The leader of the militia decides to use his body as a vessel for a biochemical disease. He ingests the disease, whoever gets in contact with him they will obviously get infected, and whoever gets in contact with the other infected...the will also get the disease, and etc. McClaren, who was once C.I.A operative, is called in to help investigate and find a cure to create a vaccine before more get infected. McClaren will do the impossible to find the cure and take down the enemy.The idea of an ""invisible"" threat is good, but this movie doesn't feel like a movie for Seagal; it should have been given to someone else like Charles Bronson (who was alive at the time) also there really isn't any action in this movie; many complain about that, personally I think it was a good choice because the story doesn't really match with martial arts. one thing that for sure kills the movie is the resolution; after they find the cure (which are flowers) they spread the cure from helicopters all over the town...that's really frooty.
