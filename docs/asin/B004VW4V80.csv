If you like the adventure of violent storm, graphic injury, with an aggressive bear on the chase, it could hold your attention.  The story is of a step-mother and teen coming together, with the father actually paying attention to the teen.  I see how it is the teen could say her step-mother was a know-it-all.  She was a bit too well informed, even in my opinion.  The teen does rise to expectation, but the wrap-up scene of a very pregnant mother, with a very revealing neckline was a very unexpected scene. It is not a movie I would choose to watch again, nor recommend to others.",2,Okay movie....but,1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,619,"['was', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'like', 'adventure', 'violent', 'storm', 'graphic', 'injury', 'aggressive', 'bear', 'chase', 'could', 'hold', 'attention', 'story', 'step-mother', 'teen', 'coming', 'together', 'father', 'actually', 'paying', 'attention', 'teen', 'see', 'how', 'teen', 'could', 'say', 'step-mother', 'was', 'know-it-all', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'well', 'informed', 'even', 'opinion', 'teen', 'rise', 'expectation', 'wrap-up', 'scene', 'very', 'pregnant', 'mother', 'very', 'revealing', 'neckline', 'was', 'very', 'unexpected', 'scene', 'not', 'movie', 'would', 'choose', 'watch', 'again', 'recommend', 'others']",Courage

Take this for what it is, and it makes for an OK entertaining night at the movies.Dad(Jason Priestly) takes new wife of two years and teenage ""don't want to be there"" daughter from first marriage on boating trip to beautiful but isolated Bear Island to have family connection.Storm kicks in, boat shipwrecks, and there just happens to be an angry grizzly on the not so Gilliganish island.  With the man injured, the women take charge.The scenery's great, the acting's adequate, the survival choices, for the most part, are quite reasonable, the story's of course predictable, and there's a cool bear doing his acting with gusto.I give it 3 1/2 stars.  No language, no sex, no real blood and guts, but too stressful for little ones to watch: Dad gets hurt, bear's trying to kill them.  I think OK preteens and older.

After receiving the news that his new book is not selling and the store he works at is going to close because of it Robert (Priestley) decides the best way to clear his head is to get on his boat with his family and get away for the weekend.  While on the way to the island getaway a storm hits and the family is stuck on an island, but they are not alone.  Being that this is a movie from the ""Faith & Family"" series, I was expecting some cheesiness from this.  I was not dissapointed.  This is a hard movie to review.  There really is no substance to this movie.  The acting is pretty bad, and the movie seems to get more and more absurd.  That being said, it is a religious themed movie and all of that stuff is to be expected so it can't be docked because of it.  It you have seen any of the other ""Faith & Family"" movies you will know what to expect from this one.  If you are looking for a feel good, uplifting movie this is a good one to pick, but again there is not much to this one.  Overall, not good, but not bad either.  A decent one time watch.  I give it a C.Would I watch again? - No I wouldn't*Also try - Letters To God & Expecting A Miracle",3,A religious themed movie about a family bonding during a tragedy.
