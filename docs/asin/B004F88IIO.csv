I was wrong to be hesitant. The show grabbed me and sucked me happily into it's storylines week after week. I will have to say, though, I was a bit happy to see Tir leave...that character was always a bit too hard to stomach. But that is actually a compliment to the writers and the actor who portrayed him, because he portrayed the arrogance and superiority of his character's race right down to the last letter. My only regret for the show was the way they ended it, with that whole pocket universe/amnesia/I'm not sure/enough with the slashes already storyline. it just seemed like the crew was just reading their lines. The audience deserved better of the show's management.  It's always easy to blame the actors first, but you have to remember, they are doing as directed and ordered, not how they may Want to interact.

1404842,A1L2HUQ1HAPE1G,B004F88IIO,"G. Richards ""econ1955""","[13, 20]","This package collects all five seasons of Andromeda, the well-known sci-fi series.  The original idea was proposed by Star Trek developer Gene Roddenberry, and there are certain similarities -- particularly the heroic captain with an enlightened vision of the future.  The premise of the series also bore some resemblance to Isaac Asimov's Foundation novels, in that the goal is to rebuild a fallen civilization.  The format was primarily episodic, although the seasons also contained long story arcs.  The results were however mixed at best.  Visually, the series was impressive, due to the extensive use of computer-generated special effects.  The scripts were, unfortunately, very uneven.  The first season was marred by implausible, overly complex plots that were intentionally philosophical but also rather pretentious.  In the second and third seasons, with a new producer in place, the scripts became more direct and entertaining.  Toward the end of the third season, the plots again became incoherent, and seemed to wander, as though the producers could not decide what to do with the premise.  The fourth season revived some of the ideas that had been used in first, with varying degrees of success.  The result was a series that was strangely uneven, with some good ideas and some glaring failures.",3,Uneven science fiction series,1308873600,"06 24, 2011",2011,1308,"['package', 'five', 'seasons', 'Andromeda', 'well-known', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'original', 'idea', 'was', 'proposed', 'Star', 'Trek', 'developer', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'are', 'certain', 'similarities', 'particularly', 'heroic', 'captain', 'enlightened', 'vision', 'future', 'premise', 'series', 'also', 'bore', 'resemblance', 'Isaac', 'Asimov', 'Foundation', 'novels', 'goal', 'rebuild', 'fallen', 'civilization', 'format', 'was', 'primarily', 'episodic', 'seasons', 'also', 'contained', 'long', 'story', 'arcs', 'results', 'were', 'however', 'mixed', 'best', 'Visually', 'series', 'was', 'impressive', 'due', 'extensive', 'use', 'computer-generated', 'special', 'effects', 'scripts', 'were', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'uneven', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'marred', 'implausible', 'overly', 'complex', 'plots', 'were', 'intentionally', 'philosophical', 'also', 'rather', 'pretentious', 'second', 'third', 'seasons', 'new', 'producer', 'place', 'scripts', 'became', 'more', 'direct', 'entertaining', 'end', 'third', 'season', 'plots', 'again', 'became', 'incoherent', 'seemed', 'wander', 'producers', 'could', 'not', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'premise', 'fourth', 'season', 'revived', 'ideas', 'had', 'been', 'used', 'first', 'varying', 'degrees', 'success', 'result', 'was', 'series', 'was', 'strangely', 'uneven', 'good', 'ideas', 'glaring', 'failures']",N/A

Many episodes look very nice on a large screen HD TV but some had scanning lines momentarily. Two discs in the set either didn't play at all or only played one of the episodes. Oddly, both were the last of a season which means there were only two episodes on the discs. Somewhat annoying, but I had another source which allowed me to at least watch the unplayable episodes at a lower quality. The show itself is fun and it has many good episodes. I enjoyed the characters as cast. Brent Stait was remarkably appealing as the really ugly Rev Bem. I like what he did with his voice for that part. Over all, this is not profound science fiction but it is very good entertainment. Worth watching several times. Kevin Sorbo as usual provided good clean entertainment in his part as lead character and producer. I think Keith Hamilton Cobb was the only non-Canadian in the cast but he did a great job playing the part of  &#34;Tyr Anasazi out of Victoria by Barbarossa.&#34; Lexa Doig had many memorable moments in the triple part of Andromeda on screen, Andromeda as android avatar, and Andromeda hologram. I enjoy her work a lot. Lisa Ryder was a blast as Beka. Laura Bertram was also very good in her part as Trance Gemini. Her part grew during the run of the show. Last but not least I very much enjoyed Gordon Michael Woolvett as the spunky engineering genius Seamus Harper. I'm glad they found a way to bring Steve Bacic back after the first episode. All in all I think some of the highest quality science fiction television shows are currently produced in Canada.

I don't want to give away any spoilers, as I have been chastised in the past for doing so. However, I will say that if you are looking for a Star Trek clone, you won't find it here. I found this series to be a new and refreshing look at science fiction in space. The lead character ""Dylan Hunt"" was really the only good guy on the ship, though the others do redeem themselves throughout the series. And, it is the interpersonal stories that make this such a great series. The overall tone of inter-species relations was there, as it was in Star Trek, but the rest was a very different universe than the Star Trek universe. ****Spoiler Alert**** In this series the lead character is frozen in time in possession of this great ship ""The Andromeda"" and wants to bring back a time of peace, happiness, and unity to the universe. The ship is unfrozen by and boarded by salvager's who are not the most respectable group of characters. Dylan Hunt exercises his authority and they become his crew. Let the adventures begin. From that point on, they form an uneasy bond and alliance. But, learn to work together. There is one among them who has his own agenda ""Tyr Anasazi"" to become more than he is within his own people. And, often his agenda conflicts with that of the crew of the Andromeda. Making for some great story lines. ***Spoiler Alert*** Over. Look, if you like Sci-fi, you want to own this set.
