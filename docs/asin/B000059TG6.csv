Aside from that it's not bad. Samuel Jackson is a very successful business man that decides to buy a house on island where black folk are not often known as home owners. The house he buys was apparently sold without too much fanfare because the islanders don't know the owners have sold it and moved away. Here comes Samuel Jacksons who gets mistaken for a burglar by two elderly folk. They call the police and here the fun begins. He doesn't know who is outside banging on his door so he calls the police and they believe he is the owner calling for help. The firefight begins and TV cameras start rolling and hostage situation arises until the sheriff learns of his mistake and tries to weasel out of it. Here come Nicholas Cage, local bad boy and he is used by the sheriff to act as the hostage taker in exchange for his freedom. Meanwhile a group of black church goers have seen the headline news and believe a black man is being persecuted.... they take the nearest ferry to protest. It quickly spirals out of control as Cage decides to change the rules and Jackson just wants to go back to the city.  It is good for a few laughs but could have been so much better since both are great actors but they can only work with the story line given and the director seemed not to have placed too much heart into what could have been a hilarious movie.",4,Okay movie,1400803200,"05 23, 2014",2014,1504,"['one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'make', 'movies', 'where', 'always', 'black', 'man', 'mistaken', 'intruder', 'Aside', 'not', 'bad', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'very', 'successful', 'business', 'man', 'buy', 'house', 'island', 'where', 'black', 'folk', 'are', 'not', 'often', 'known', 'home', 'owners', 'house', 'was', 'apparently', 'sold', 'too', 'much', 'fanfare', 'islanders', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'owners', 'have', 'sold', 'moved', 'away', 'Here', 'Samuel', 'Jacksons', 'who', 'mistaken', 'burglar', 'two', 'elderly', 'folk', 'call', 'police', 'here', 'fun', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'outside', 'banging', 'door', 'so', 'police', 'believe', 'owner', 'calling', 'help', 'firefight', 'TV', 'cameras', 'start', 'rolling', 'hostage', 'situation', 'sheriff', 'learns', 'mistake', 'tries', 'weasel', 'Here', 'come', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'local', 'bad', 'boy', 'used', 'sheriff', 'act', 'hostage', 'taker', 'exchange', 'freedom', 'Meanwhile', 'group', 'black', 'church', 'goers', 'have', 'seen', 'headline', 'news', 'believe', 'black', 'man', 'being', 'persecuted', 'take', 'nearest', 'ferry', 'protest', 'quickly', 'control', 'Cage', 'change', 'rules', 'Jackson', 'just', 'go', 'back', 'city', 'good', 'few', 'laughs', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'can', 'only', 'work', 'story', 'line', 'given', 'director', 'seemed', 'not', 'have', 'placed', 'too', 'much', 'heart', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'hilarious', 'movie']",N/A

Jackson-Pulp Fiction) who moves onto an island community in New England that is all white. Thereafter, through a complicated set of circumstances, he is shot at, held hostage, etc. all because of the island people's innate prejudices. Nicolas Cage (Honeymoon in Vegas) is Amos Odell, a two-bit criminal enlisted by the island's police chief (Dabney Coleman-Short Time) to help him save face before the next election. It's all overly intricate, and whatever chances the film had at comedy are smothered by the heavy-handed social statements. To top everything else off, a very good supporting cast is given little to do.

Samuel L. Jackson plays Andrew Sterling, a wealthy black entrepreneur, who recently had his picture on the cover of Fortune magazine.  He buys a summer house at a snooty island community, but no one knows it.  While he's hooking up his stereo on his first night in the house, snooping neighbors assume because he's black, he must be a burglar!  They contact the local sheriff and he takes a small Army to the house and a mishap by a bumbling deputy triggers an attack on Jackson.  Once he finds out his mistake, the politically motivated sheriff (he's running for County Commissioner) decides he needs to clean up his act and does so by making a deal with a second rate criminal (Nicolas Cage) to pretend to be the burglar.  Of course, things don't go as planned and there's where we get the rest of this broadly humorous film.Jackson and Cage do well in their roles, Cage assuaging a restrained swagger and Jackson oozing his indignity as a black citizen in a white world.  Dabney Coleman as the sheriff is his typically nasty and manipulative self; Margaret Colin and Michael Lerner are very funny as the couple who call the police; Brad Dourif is hilarious as the inept deputy, and Bob Balaban as a hostage negotiator is very funny too.The movie is full of stereotypical characters, including Giancarlo Esposito as some kind of minister, and hopefully we have evolved from this racist kind of behavior.
