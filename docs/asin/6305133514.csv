451085,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,6305133514,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[3, 3]","'Lean on Me' takes another educational figure and puts him at the head of the class.  Hot-tempered, but motivational, Joe Clark (Morgan Freeman) takes the helm of New Jersey's East Side High School once the seat of academic excellence.  Facing undaunting turmoil, the school he has but one year to shape up is full of drug dealers, fights, and general mayhem.  Knowing that to get anyone to obey the rules, you have to enforce all, Clark ""takes no prisoners"" and armed with a megaphone and locks to keep criminals out, he gives his student body a whole new outlook on life.  But between his scornful nemesis, Leona Barrett (Lynne Thigpen) and a desperate and unpopular mayor (Alan North), he has more than his martinet sensibilities to keep in check.Seeing Morgan Freeman not play someone sage and mellow is a real treat.  Sometimes his character makes us laugh and smile, especially when we see his soft heart behind the tough talk.  With a convincing set of actors and situations, the story doesn't try to whitewash the problems or the hero's idiosyncracies.

It may not be pretty, but he gets results. The same goes for Lean on Me. Shame on anybody who saw this film and passed it by because this movie features the greatest performance of Morgan Freeman's career. Although he had done supporting work in Driving Miss Daisy, The Shawshank Redemption, Glory, Million Dollar Baby, Seven, and Unforgiven (think about that...this is an impressive list of movies he had been part of), Morgan Freeman has never shined as bright as he did in Lean on Me. His performance carried the picture throughout and with the aid in direction of John G. Avildsen, who brought us none other than Rocky. Joe Clark, the character Morgan Freeman plays on Lean on Me, is one of the great characters where there is so much raw about him while he is portrayed ironically as a hero, no different than Oskar Schindler of Schindler's List. Lean on Me is so good that I could feel goose bumps every time I see it because of the thrilling scenes, the feelings that Morgan Freeman brings to his character, and the electrifying wavelengths that he sends to the rest of the cast. Lean on Me flowed naturally that it felt so real. Think about it...if Morgan Freeman wasn't casted as Joe Clark, would the movie have worked? I think not. Robert Guillaume was superb as Dr. Napier who shows that he is the real HNIC behind Joe Clark. Lean on Me is the film to be seen again and again.4/08: The king of school films, Lean on Me is a heartwarming tale based on a true story that happened in mid 80s and showcases an electrifying performance from Morgan Freeman. As I've seen Lean on Me countless of times, it's a film that never gets tiresome. In fact, the more I watch it, the more troublesome I get when deciding who was the best actor of 1989: Morgan Freeman of Lean on Me or Daniel Day-Lewis of My Left Foot along with Hugh O'Conor (who undeservingly got very little attention). John G. Avildsen once again scores a masterpiece by creating an inspirational movie after his winning work Rocky. What is interesting about Lean on Me is how well the secondary feelings are brought out during Joe Clark's single-minded warpath. The others get hurt and voice out their feelings. That's why Lean on Me feels more human than often not. I remember seeing an absolutely stupid film called The Principal and then wanting to point out everything from Lean on Me that The Principal is not. When I love a film so much, it's usually hard to write a long essay. The same goes for Lean on Me, one of the best I've seen and is among my collection of favorites.3/12: Once again, Morgan Freeman is thrilling as Joe Clark and gives one of the best performances ever.",5,Morgan Freeman in a Performance of His Career.,1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,2823,"['Viewed', '6/03', '11/04', '12/06', '4/08', '3/12Rate', '1012/06', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'principal', 'determined', 'make', 'change', 'better', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'nobody', 'what', 'doing', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'pretty', 'results', 'same', 'Lean', 'Me', 'Shame', 'anybody', 'who', 'saw', 'film', 'passed', 'movie', 'greatest', 'performance', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'career', 'had', 'done', 'supporting', 'work', 'Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Glory', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Seven', 'Unforgiven', 'think', 'impressive', 'list', 'movies', 'had', 'been', 'part', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'never', 'shined', 'as', 'bright', 'did', 'Lean', 'Me', 'performance', 'carried', 'picture', 'aid', 'direction', 'John', 'G.', 'Avildsen', 'who', 'brought', 'none', 'other', 'Rocky', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'character', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Lean', 'Me', 'one', 'great', 'characters', 'where', 'so', 'much', 'raw', 'portrayed', 'ironically', 'hero', 'different', 'Oskar', 'Schindler', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Lean', 'Me', 'so', 'good', 'could', 'feel', 'goose', 'bumps', 'time', 'see', 'thrilling', 'scenes', 'feelings', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'character', 'electrifying', 'wavelengths', 'rest', 'cast', 'Lean', 'Me', 'flowed', 'naturally', 'felt', 'so', 'real', 'Think', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'was', ""n't"", 'casted', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'would', 'movie', 'have', 'worked', 'think', 'not', 'Robert', 'Guillaume', 'was', 'superb', 'Dr.', 'Napier', 'who', 'real', 'HNIC', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'Lean', 'Me', 'film', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'again.4/08', 'king', 'school', 'films', 'Lean', 'Me', 'heartwarming', 'tale', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'happened', 'mid', '80s', 'electrifying', 'performance', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Lean', 'Me', 'countless', 'times', 'film', 'never', 'tiresome', 'fact', 'more', 'watch', 'more', 'troublesome', 'get', 'when', 'deciding', 'who', 'was', 'best', 'actor', '1989', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Lean', 'Me', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'My', 'Left', 'Foot', 'Hugh', ""O'Conor"", 'who', 'undeservingly', 'got', 'very', 'little', 'attention', 'John', 'G.', 'Avildsen', 'once', 'again', 'masterpiece', 'creating', 'inspirational', 'movie', 'winning', 'work', 'Rocky', 'What', 'interesting', 'Lean', 'Me', 'how', 'well', 'secondary', 'feelings', 'are', 'brought', 'out', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'single-minded', 'warpath', 'others', 'get', 'hurt', 'voice', 'out', 'feelings', 'why', 'Lean', 'Me', 'feels', 'more', 'human', 'often', 'not', 'remember', 'seeing', 'absolutely', 'stupid', 'film', 'called', 'Principal', 'then', 'wanting', 'point', 'out', 'everything', 'Lean', 'Me', 'Principal', 'not', 'When', 'love', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'usually', 'hard', 'write', 'long', 'essay', 'same', 'Lean', 'Me', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'collection', 'favorites.3/12', 'Once', 'again', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'thrilling', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'ever']",Lean on Me

This one is very inspirational, and also includes two of my favorite actors: Morgan Freeman and Robert Guillaume. Freeman plays Joe Clark, the principal of Eastside High in Paterson, New Jersey, which he converted from a ghetto war zone into a serious school where the kids really learned, and learned to love him in the process. Guillaume plays Superintendent of Schools Frank Napier, who wants to believe in Joe Clark, but has a lot of trouble with the mayor and other politicians, including one member of the school board who strikes me as some sort of communist agitator. At the very least, she uses some very underhanded tactics and makes a deal with the mayor to deliver a large body of votes to him in exchange for his assistance in getting rid of Joe Clark.I'm not sure if this story provides a plan for turning around blighted urban schools, but one element was deftly avoided. Principal Clark chained and padlocked the side doors after discovering that a drug dealer was using them to gain access to the school. The kids accepted it because they felt he was protecting them. But the bitch on the school board used that as an excuse to have the fire marshall arrest Clark. Early on it was mentioned that they should have locking doors with panic bars that set off alarms, but the school board and/or the state was unwilling to pay for them. I think more should have been made of that, except that they never did get their retrofitted doors (at least in the course of the movie), so I guess they could not be emphasized.Which is to say, sometime money DOES make a real difference, if it is spent wisely.",5,"True Story, Brilliantly Told",1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,1648,"['love', 'movies', 'based', 'true', 'stories', 'one', 'very', 'inspirational', 'also', 'two', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Robert', 'Guillaume', 'Freeman', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'principal', 'Eastside', 'High', 'Paterson', 'New', 'Jersey', 'converted', 'ghetto', 'war', 'zone', 'serious', 'school', 'where', 'kids', 'really', 'learned', 'learned', 'love', 'process', 'Guillaume', 'Superintendent', 'Schools', 'Frank', 'Napier', 'who', 'believe', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'lot', 'trouble', 'mayor', 'other', 'politicians', 'including', 'one', 'member', 'school', 'board', 'who', 'sort', 'communist', 'agitator', 'very', 'least', 'very', 'underhanded', 'tactics', 'deal', 'mayor', 'deliver', 'large', 'body', 'votes', 'exchange', 'assistance', 'getting', 'rid', 'Joe', 'Clark.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'story', 'plan', 'turning', 'around', 'blighted', 'urban', 'schools', 'one', 'element', 'was', 'deftly', 'avoided', 'Principal', 'Clark', 'chained', 'padlocked', 'side', 'doors', 'discovering', 'drug', 'dealer', 'was', 'using', 'gain', 'access', 'school', 'kids', 'accepted', 'felt', 'was', 'protecting', 'bitch', 'school', 'board', 'used', 'excuse', 'have', 'fire', 'marshall', 'arrest', 'Clark', 'Early', 'was', 'mentioned', 'should', 'have', 'locking', 'doors', 'panic', 'bars', 'set', 'off', 'alarms', 'school', 'board', 'and/or', 'state', 'was', 'unwilling', 'pay', 'think', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'never', 'did', 'get', 'retrofitted', 'doors', 'least', 'course', 'movie', 'so', 'guess', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'emphasized.Which', 'say', 'sometime', 'money', 'DOES', 'make', 'real', 'difference', 'spent', 'wisely']",Lean on Me

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","1988'sStand And Deliverand 1989's Lean On Me were two feel-good movies concerning our besieged educational system that left an indelible impression on me back in the day. They're stories made even more riveting by virtue of that they're based on real events and actual people. Stand and Deliver triumphantly stands the test of time; it's one of my favorite movies ever. But Lean On Me......tells the story of ""Crazy Joe"" Clark. In 1987, Eastside High of Paterson, New Jersey is as low down as it could get. The state report ranks Eastside High last in the state. Drugs and firearms and scholastic ennui run rampant in Eastside. The teachers have lost all control. A bill has just passed mandating that 75% of the students must pass the minimum basic skills test or, else, the state takes control by the end of the school year. Sad thing is, the year prior, only 38% of the students passed the minimum basic skills test. The mayor (Alan North) of Paterson is fuming mightily, not because he cares all that much about book learnin' but mostly because he's up for re-election. He needs someone to step into inner-city Eastside High and take charge. He needs someone with nothing to lose.Dedicated but combative teacher Joe Clark has burned bridges everywhere he's went. Today he's exiled as an elementary school principal. When a former colleague (a very good Robert Guillaume) approaches Joe with an offer to preside over Eastside, well, it means that, among other things, director John G. Avildsen's found himself another underdog vehicle to champion.To me - or rather, to an earlier me - Joe Clark and Stand and Deliver's Jaime Escalante seemed like two educators cut from the same cloth. It wasn't 'til repeated viewings did it dawn on me that while Escalante was fierce and demanding, Joe Clark was straight-up angry and resentful. Escalante exhibited unexpected warmth. Since we're not mincing words, Joe Clark proved to be a dictatorial tool. The subversive truth is that this incarnation of Joe Clark is a bully, a martinet disdainful of his staff's feelings and opinions. You root for him early on as he arrives at Eastside - as he steps into that ""cauldron of violence"" - and as he promptly lays down the law. His first administrative act as new principal is to expel 300 of the school's worst student offenders. He informs his teachers that ""This is not a damn democracy. We are in a state of emergency, and my word is law."" To quote one admiring student: ""Mr. Clark don't play!"" Right on, ""Crazy Joe.""As the film goes on, we wait for him to thaw out, to become a more sympathetic character. But he doesn't get there, not really. If you've gotten used to Morgan Freeman as this amiable elderly statesman, only put this movie on to realize how fiercely this guy can chew scenery. Freeman is sensational and is at his most showy, stomping around and having hissy fits and deploying the most malevolent death stare since the Sonny Liston era.Whether he's chaining up all entry points to Eastside (to prevent the bad elements from sneaking in) or intimidating his students into learning the school song (and we get an unexpected, fantastic singing scene out of that) or whether slugging an armed juvie, ""Crazy Joe"" Clark intends to turn Eastside High around even if it means terrorizing and alienating everyone around him. So we laud him for his unorthodox disciplinary efforts even as we condemn him for being too harsh a taskmaster and for his unwillingness to bend, for his unshakeable belief that he's infallible. How can you teach when you yourself are unteachable? Lean on Me has relevance and I recommend it for Morgan Freeman's ferocious performance and for the film's sometimes harrowing peek into inner-city truths and for the occasional comic flourish. If you can distill the movie down to one scene, it's that one where Joe Clark is on the roof and dropping real talk on Sams, a young hooligan pleading for a second chance. When it takes someone as abrasive and intractable as Joe Clark to turn things around - Joe Clark who, when being coaxed by Guillaume to take on Eastside, bitterly remarks: ""I don't have to do nothing but stay black and die."" - then you know we're in trouble.",4,"""It kills your brain cells, son, it kills your brain cells!""",1380499200,"09 30, 2013",2013,4198,"[""1988'sStand"", 'Deliverand', '1989', 'Lean', 'Me', 'were', 'two', 'feel-good', 'movies', 'concerning', 'besieged', 'educational', 'system', 'left', 'indelible', 'impression', 'back', 'day', ""'re"", 'stories', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'riveting', 'virtue', ""'re"", 'based', 'real', 'events', 'actual', 'people', 'Stand', 'Deliver', 'triumphantly', 'test', 'time', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'ever', 'Lean', 'Me', 'story', 'Crazy', 'Joe', 'Clark', '1987', 'Eastside', 'High', 'Paterson', 'New', 'Jersey', 'low', 'down', 'could', 'get', 'state', 'report', 'ranks', 'Eastside', 'High', 'last', 'state', 'Drugs', 'firearms', 'scholastic', 'ennui', 'run', 'rampant', 'Eastside', 'teachers', 'have', 'lost', 'control', 'bill', 'just', 'passed', 'mandating', '75', '%', 'students', 'must', 'pass', 'minimum', 'basic', 'skills', 'test', 'else', 'state', 'control', 'end', 'school', 'year', 'Sad', 'thing', 'year', 'prior', 'only', '38', '%', 'students', 'passed', 'minimum', 'basic', 'skills', 'test', 'mayor', 'Alan', 'North', 'Paterson', 'fuming', 'mightily', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'book', 'learnin', 'mostly', 'up', 're-election', 'someone', 'step', 'inner-city', 'Eastside', 'High', 'take', 'charge', 'someone', 'nothing', 'lose.Dedicated', 'combative', 'teacher', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'burned', 'bridges', 'everywhere', 'went', 'Today', 'exiled', 'elementary', 'school', 'principal', 'When', 'former', 'colleague', 'very', 'good', 'Robert', 'Guillaume', 'Joe', 'offer', 'preside', 'Eastside', 'well', 'other', 'things', 'director', 'John', 'G.', 'Avildsen', 'found', 'underdog', 'vehicle', 'champion.To', 'rather', 'earlier', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'Stand', 'Deliver', 'Jaime', 'Escalante', 'seemed', 'two', 'educators', 'cut', 'same', 'cloth', 'was', ""n't"", ""'til"", 'repeated', 'viewings', 'did', 'dawn', 'Escalante', 'was', 'fierce', 'demanding', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'was', 'straight-up', 'angry', 'resentful', 'Escalante', 'exhibited', 'unexpected', 'warmth', ""'re"", 'not', 'mincing', 'words', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'proved', 'be', 'dictatorial', 'tool', 'subversive', 'truth', 'incarnation', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'bully', 'martinet', 'disdainful', 'staff', 'feelings', 'opinions', 'root', 'early', 'Eastside', 'cauldron', 'violence', 'promptly', 'down', 'law', 'first', 'administrative', 'act', 'new', 'principal', 'expel', '300', 'school', 'worst', 'student', 'offenders', 'teachers', 'not', 'damn', 'democracy', 'are', 'state', 'emergency', 'word', 'law', 'quote', 'one', 'admiring', 'student', 'Mr.', 'Clark', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'Right', 'Crazy', 'Joe', 'film', 'wait', 'thaw', 'out', 'become', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'character', ""n't"", 'get', 'there', 'not', 'really', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'used', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'amiable', 'elderly', 'statesman', 'only', 'put', 'movie', 'realize', 'how', 'fiercely', 'guy', 'can', 'chew', 'scenery', 'Freeman', 'sensational', 'most', 'showy', 'stomping', 'around', 'having', 'hissy', 'fits', 'deploying', 'most', 'malevolent', 'death', 'stare', 'Sonny', 'Liston', 'chaining', 'up', 'entry', 'points', 'Eastside', 'prevent', 'bad', 'elements', 'sneaking', 'intimidating', 'students', 'learning', 'school', 'song', 'get', 'unexpected', 'fantastic', 'singing', 'scene', 'slugging', 'armed', 'juvie', 'Crazy', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'turn', 'Eastside', 'High', 'even', 'terrorizing', 'alienating', 'everyone', 'laud', 'unorthodox', 'disciplinary', 'efforts', 'even', 'condemn', 'being', 'too', 'taskmaster', 'unwillingness', 'bend', 'unshakeable', 'belief', 'infallible', 'How', 'can', 'teach', 'when', 'are', 'unteachable', 'Lean', 'Me', 'relevance', 'recommend', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'ferocious', 'performance', 'film', 'sometimes', 'harrowing', 'peek', 'inner-city', 'truths', 'occasional', 'comic', 'flourish', 'can', 'distill', 'movie', 'down', 'one', 'scene', 'one', 'where', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'roof', 'dropping', 'real', 'talk', 'Sams', 'young', 'hooligan', 'pleading', 'second', 'chance', 'When', 'someone', 'abrasive', 'intractable', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'turn', 'things', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'who', 'when', 'being', 'coaxed', 'Guillaume', 'take', 'Eastside', 'bitterly', 'remarks', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'nothing', 'stay', 'black', 'die', 'then', 'know', ""'re"", 'trouble']",Lean on Me
451109,A350AS5CUDC6GW,6305133514,james d. leverton,"[4, 6]","""Lean on Me"" is one entertaining movie, and Morgan Freeman is sensational in it.  In fact, if he hadn't made another movie that year called ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" he probably would have gotten an Oscar nomination for this.  That said, I have to say the film has gotten the traditional Hollywood biographical treatment, which is to say credibility and plot coherence take a backseat to uplifting entertainment.  The final score:  for entertainment value, give ""Lean on Me"" *****; however, it only ranks a * on the credibility scale.The plot has been regurgitated enough by previous reviewers, and several of the more honest reviews have been incisive and accurate in pointing out the flaws in the plot.  I, too, had a hard time with the chaining and locking of the school doors; this act is such a flagrant violation of the fire code it is laughable and puts the safety of hundreds of students at risk.  Also, the speech Clark gives where he blames the faculty for the failure of the students (in front of the student body, no less) is offensive and disrespectful and totally ignores a more important problem altogether: the total unwillingness of many parents to take responsibility for their failings as parents and for the acts of their children.  And I truly doubt Clark could get by with expelling three hundred students and face the wrath of a small group of angry parents led by what can only be described as a cruel stereotype: the loud-mouthed, trouble-making, liberal-minded, white and authority-hating ghetto mother, played by the late, wonderful character actress Lynne Thigpen. (Even she struggles with this dreadful role.) And the entire student body rallying to Clark's defense when his irresponsible actions finally catch up with him?  Laughable, to say the least.  But I have to disagree with the reviewer who characterized the story as a ""liberalization"" of what really happened.  If anything, Clark's tough-love approach to running the school is extremely conservative in nature, and many of his educational tactics are reminiscent of G.W. Bush's ""No Child Left Behind"" educational programs, which is the main reason Thigpen and the other parents fight him as hard as they do.But as I said up front, the film is definitely entertaining if it isn't taken too seriously.  Director John G. Avildsen approaches the material in the typical crowd-pleasing, underdogs-win-in-the-end-so-let's-have-a-good-cry manner, which is effective until fifteen minutes after the film is over and you kick yourself in the butt for being manipulated.  And the supporting cast is stellar, including Robert Guillaume, Beverly Todd (as the beleagured vice principle) and Michael Beach.  And the wonderful Regina King has a touching two-scene cameo as a depressed, unemployed mother who no longer feels worthy of her daughter's love.But this is Freeman's show and his incredible performance dominates the proceedings.  No matter how ridiculous his actions, no matter how over-the-top his character travels, (picking up a baseball bat and declaring to the press: ""They call me ""Crazy Joe"" now they can call me Batman!"") he makes Clark believable and manages to pull back and reflect on his own shortcomings and accept criticism at just the right time to keep the character from becoming a total egomaniac.  He is sensational, and ""Lean on Me"" was one of several consecutive films (including ""Street Smart,"" ""Clean and Sober,"" ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" and ""Glory"") in the late '80's that made him one of the most unlikely superstars in cinema history.Believe me, you'll love ""Lean on Me.""

451126,A22RY8N8CNDF3A,6305133514,"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[3, 3]","Morgan Freeman does an excellent job depicting Joe Clark, former principal of inner-city Eastside High in Paterson, N.J. Clark previously had been an Army drill instructor, elementary school teacher and then principal in one of the city's worst neighborhoods. Ninety percent of that school's 1,000 students, mostly poor blacks and Latinos, read below grade level when Clark took over; by 1982 the school was so much better that Clark was hailed s a miracle man and sent to Eastside High. Freeman shows Clark as primarily an autocratic  disciplinarian who encouraged school pride and good behavior. There he stayed for seven years.In 1979 the county prosecutor's office labeled Eastside 'a  caldron of terror and violence.' Drug deals were made in the open, and principals and teachers routine assaulted. One hundred fifty teachers out of two hundred departed during his first five years. Clark admits he encourages them to leave by routinely bawling them out in front of their classes.Unfortunately, other sources report that education scores did not substantially improve, resulting in Eastside High being taken over by the state one year after Clark's departure in 1991. Others criticized Clark's expelling large numbers of delinquent students to improve test scores as 'simply moving the problems from the school onto the street.' And the film exaggerated his students' test scores, as well as the graffiti on the walls prior to his arrival.Another distortion - the film depicted Clark as keeping fire inspectors out as a by-product of his chaining doors to keep out drug dealers. Reality - it was a state monitoring team that Clark kept out. Further, the reason the school board threatened to fire him - ' unbecoming conduct' and 'insubordination.' The board retreated after praise poured in from Education Secretary William Bennett after an adulatory Time magazine cover story and a six-figure contract for the movie rights.Clark forced out about 600 students/year, proportionately quite higher than other Paterson schools. And the teachers did not sit quietly by as Clark verbally attacked and even fired a number of them - they filed more grievances against Mr. Lark than any other principal in Paterson. A local paper reported that fewer Eastside students went on to college or trade school since his arrival - from 53.6% in 1982 to 42.3% in 1987.",3,An Inspiring Myth -,1382659200,"10 25, 2013",2013,2355,"['Morgan', 'Freeman', 'excellent', 'job', 'depicting', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'former', 'principal', 'inner-city', 'Eastside', 'High', 'Paterson', 'N.J.', 'Clark', 'previously', 'had', 'been', 'Army', 'drill', 'instructor', 'elementary', 'school', 'teacher', 'then', 'principal', 'one', 'city', 'worst', 'neighborhoods', 'Ninety', 'percent', 'school', '1,000', 'students', 'mostly', 'poor', 'blacks', 'Latinos', 'read', 'grade', 'level', 'when', 'Clark', 'took', 'over', '1982', 'school', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Clark', 'was', 'hailed', 's', 'miracle', 'man', 'sent', 'Eastside', 'High', 'Freeman', 'Clark', 'primarily', 'autocratic', 'disciplinarian', 'who', 'encouraged', 'school', 'pride', 'good', 'behavior', 'stayed', 'seven', 'years.In', '1979', 'county', 'prosecutor', 'office', 'labeled', 'Eastside', 'caldron', 'terror', 'violence', 'Drug', 'deals', 'were', 'made', 'open', 'principals', 'teachers', 'routine', 'assaulted', 'One', 'hundred', 'fifty', 'teachers', 'two', 'hundred', 'departed', 'first', 'five', 'years', 'Clark', 'leave', 'routinely', 'bawling', 'out', 'front', 'classes.Unfortunately', 'other', 'sources', 'report', 'education', 'scores', 'did', 'not', 'substantially', 'improve', 'resulting', 'Eastside', 'High', 'being', 'taken', 'over', 'state', 'one', 'year', 'Clark', 'departure', '1991', 'Others', 'criticized', 'Clark', 'expelling', 'large', 'numbers', 'delinquent', 'students', 'improve', 'test', 'scores', ""'simply"", 'moving', 'problems', 'school', 'street', 'film', 'exaggerated', 'students', 'test', 'scores', 'as', 'well', 'graffiti', 'walls', 'prior', 'arrival.Another', 'distortion', 'film', 'depicted', 'Clark', 'keeping', 'fire', 'inspectors', 'out', 'by-product', 'chaining', 'doors', 'keep', 'out', 'drug', 'dealers', 'Reality', 'was', 'state', 'monitoring', 'team', 'Clark', 'kept', 'out', 'Further', 'reason', 'school', 'board', 'threatened', 'fire', 'unbecoming', 'conduct', ""'insubordination"", 'board', 'retreated', 'praise', 'poured', 'Education', 'Secretary', 'William', 'Bennett', 'adulatory', 'Time', 'magazine', 'cover', 'story', 'six-figure', 'contract', 'movie', 'rights.Clark', 'forced', 'about', '600', 'students/year', 'proportionately', 'quite', 'higher', 'other', 'Paterson', 'schools', 'teachers', 'did', 'not', 'sit', 'quietly', 'Clark', 'verbally', 'attacked', 'even', 'fired', 'number', 'filed', 'more', 'grievances', 'Mr.', 'Lark', 'other', 'principal', 'Paterson', 'A', 'local', 'paper', 'reported', 'fewer', 'Eastside', 'students', 'went', 'college', 'trade', 'school', 'arrival', '53.6', '%', '1982', '42.3', '%', '1987']",Lean on Me

My biggest problem is how the filmmakers made it a point that Joe Clark blamed the teachers for everything wrong at that school. Is it their fault that the school district didn't do all it could to help the school? Is it there fault that the principals hadn't done all they could in the past? Is it their fault the kids swung in trees and had no discipline? NO! There was too much fingerpointing at the teachers and not enough at the parents. This is not how the real Eastside was. No one in their right mind would send their kids to a school if it was this bad. No school district would put up with it. The film just made a mockery of the education system by putting the blame on teachers and it wasn't fair. They made Joe Clark seem like some superman who helped the school on his own.

All the while, inner city youth are being passed on from grade to grade without ever learning.  Public school teachers today are forbidden to give a student anything less than a C.  A high proportion of High School seniors could not pass the 8th grade, if the standards were actually applied.

451151,AMGGZCWY3VNZC,6305133514,S. Morales,"[0, 0]","Lean on Me is a film which may or may not be based on a true story or true events, yet it doesn't necessarily matter. It is an honest look into the life of what a struggling inner city school was like during the 1980s, before many modern interventions and precautions were ever put into place. The main problem here being, this honesty is taken to some exaggerated levels, and the audience is constantly being reminded of how ticked off and stressed everyone at this East Side High School is, and how far and heavy Morgan Freeman's ""Mr. Clarke"" character as the new principal (who is hired to finally set things straight) has to go to get his high school students back on track, as well as his school's reputation in general. Sprinkled with some typical cliches and almost constantly rammed down the audience's throats, what could initially be seen as an overall annoying and preachy movie, when spinkled with some salt beforehand, does make for some compelling, even at times giggle-inducing drama.Joe Clarke, played by Morgan Freeman in perhaps his loudest role, is a man who was a former teacher at East Side High School, where back in the 1960s used to be a calmer, much quieter and sweeter school harbored mostly by middle class white students. Informed of some budget cuts, Mr. Clarke becomes upset and abruptly leaves. In this opening sequence we quickly see in a setting ""morph"" scene how East Side High goes from a sweet and calm white school to a run down, graffiti-walled and circle of hell school now attended by mostly black students, where drug dealing runs rampant, and violence and constantly ensuing (this is of course due to the budget cuts Mr. Clarke disagreed with in the first place). How the teachers deal with such matters is beyond me, and this is where the exaggeration begins. No way in hell would any teacher in this country ever put up with teaching at such a school... but things might have been different back then.Anyway, the board decides to seek hour Mr. Clarke (who is now working at a more affluent suburban white elementary school) to take the role as principle to see if he can fix all the mess the board has caused. Thus he begins his mission, using ANY means necessary, to save the school and remake it into a NEW East Side High, where children can be respectful, hardworking people. He does this by kicking expelling much of the bad seeds and using an iron fist (to both students AND teachers alike), through plenty of yelling scenes in a take-no-prisoners, no holds barred, take-no-crap, zero tolerance attitude, but still with enough sensitivity to not become a complete monster... at least not in the perception of everyone, as many of the teachers take a big disliking to him; the biggest disliking being the school board who is now deciding to try and somehow kick Mr. Clarke out. Why? We never are really told nor do we really care, but we do need an antagonist so the school board is it. Meanwhile, Mr. Clarke is actually SAVING the school the school board initially is responsible for ruining.We get plenty of yelling, screaming and humiliation towards students as well as teachers from Mr. Clarke and company for the vast majority of the film. Tossed in we get a few cliches, like the obligatory scene featuring a young girl who got kicked out of her house, so in order for the film makers to force a ""teachers will save these kids at ANY cost"" persona, Mr. Clarke and the vice principal both head towards this girl's house to speak with her mom, in a useless, stale-acted scene that should have been left on the cutting room floor. Afterwards, more tension between Clarke, his decisions and company, plenty of more yelling, and eventually the police and fire chief catching Mr. Clarke illegally chaining the doors to keep the drug dealers out, and sending him to prison for breaking the law. Of course throughout all of this the students start to really fall in love with this man, as would most likely be the case as he is the only one in their lives who has ever showed any care for their well-being and betterment. The final scene then gives us the unrealistic and cliche scene where ALL the school's students gather together in a march towards the prison Mr. Clarke is being held in to protest for his release. Whether or not he is isn't shown, but what is shown is how the students were able to achieve their passing of the State's 'Basic Skills Test,' a standardized State test where students can prove they can count, add 2 + 2 and read at a 6th grade level.So lots of it is cliched, lots of unrealistic, lots of the film is just overt yelling and screaming and grand preaching. If it's entertaining, I say 'so what?' And this film does entertain, because all this yelling and nail-biting is well acted, thanks mostly to Morgan Freeman, and does keep you gripped on the surprisingly well-written dialogue. Direction is done very well, and pacing never slows down, keeping you watching from start to finish. So all in all, people can say what they'd like about this film, but not only is it entertaining, but one of those films you may find yourself watching over and over and over again simply because the story itself is just interesting, plain and simple. Performances are gripping, plain and simple. Dramatic yelling is always enticing, plain and simple. After about the 3rd or 4th viewing, these characters begin to grow on you as they have for me after all of these years and perhaps at least 100 viewings.I like it, and if you've never seen it, it is definitley worth watching if at least solely for the dramatic tension. Just don't expect to take away any sort of life lesson. The events, attitudes and procedures these teachers take and students portray are too out-dated already.",4,"Very Enjoyable, if Exaggerated and Loudly Dramatic",1331683200,"03 14,

Every line, every expression--just priceless.  Rolling his eyes as he reads answers over a student's shoulder during a test made me laugh out loud.  His nonstop rants against students, teachers, parents, pretty everybody are both funny and powerful.Around this same time, Freeman put out two other movies.  One was GLORY.  The speech he gives as a former slave-turned-soldier at the campfire before the big climactic battle brought tears to my eyes.  The other movie was STREET SMART with Christopher Reeve.  Freeman plays a pimp who blackmails Reeve for an alibi and he's absolutely chilling.

451166,A3OI841P5R6FCH,6305133514,Zagnorch,"[31, 34]","`Lean On Me' has become one of my favorite inspirational movies involving real people and events, despite the simplified and sometimes sappy-sickly-sweet Hollywood `feel-good' treatment it's been given, along with a happy ending that ties everything up a bit too neat and nice. The forces trying to stop Joe Clark's straightforward efforts to turn Eastside High School around has been simplified for the movie, basically involving just a disgruntled parent and the city mayor. Even the many heated arguments between Clark and his faculty &amp; superiors are less than sophisticated in wording and tone. None the less, I've always loved Morgan Freeman's performance of Clark.Clark's expulsion of the most delinquent students was a pretty neat scene, and was something of a surprise when I first saw it. Anyone who'd attempt that nowadays would probably get sued penniless. And the rooftop scene where he tells expelled crackhead student Thomas Sams to just jump off the roof of the school and kill himself swiftly rather than slowly by smoking crack is one of my fave film moments, and the best 'tough love' moment in movie history: ""It kills your brain cells, son, it kills your brain cells!""And as the school improves, Clark does as well. In the movie you see him learning and adapting alongside the students &amp; faculty. Even with his best efforts, he discovers that can't turn things around by himself. At first, his gruff behavior and strongarm approaches to solving problems makes most of the teachers reluctant to help him out. But they learn to adapt to Clark, and he learns to soften his methods a bit, and even gains a sense of humor.Sadly, the real Joe Clark, to a small degree, has `gone Hollywood'. His big gig nowadays is working the lecture circuit, as a motivational speaker. He's even written a book about what to do to save America's public schools. I've heard some of his speeches, and found them rather compelling, but I feel his talents and drive are best suited for running a school in need of a decisive, no-nonsense leader who gets things done.`Late...",4,'Crazy Joe' goes Hollywood...,970099200,"09 28, 2000",2000,2077,"['Lean', 'Me', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'inspirational', 'movies', 'involving', 'real', 'people', 'events', 'simplified', 'sometimes', 'sappy-sickly-sweet', 'Hollywood', 'feel-good', 'treatment', 'been', 'given', 'happy', 'ending', 'ties', 'everything', 'up', 'bit', 'too', 'neat', 'nice', 'forces', 'trying', 'stop', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'straightforward', 'efforts', 'turn', 'Eastside', 'High', 'School', 'been', 'simplified', 'movie', 'basically', 'involving', 'just', 'disgruntled', 'parent', 'city', 'mayor', 'Even', 'many', 'heated', 'arguments', 'Clark', 'faculty', 'amp', 'superiors', 'are', 'less', 'sophisticated', 'wording', 'tone', 'None', 'less', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'performance', 'Clark.Clark', 'expulsion', 'most', 'delinquent', 'students', 'was', 'pretty', 'neat', 'scene', 'was', 'something', 'surprise', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Anyone', 'who', ""'d"", 'attempt', 'nowadays', 'would', 'probably', 'get', 'sued', 'penniless', 'rooftop', 'scene', 'where', 'expelled', 'crackhead', 'student', 'Thomas', 'Sams', 'just', 'jump', 'off', 'roof', 'school', 'kill', 'swiftly', 'rather', 'slowly', 'smoking', 'crack', 'one', 'fave', 'film', 'moments', 'best', 'love', 'moment', 'movie', 'history', 'brain', 'cells', 'son', 'brain', 'cells', 'school', 'Clark', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'see', 'learning', 'adapting', 'students', 'amp', 'faculty', 'Even', 'best', 'efforts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'turn', 'things', 'first', 'gruff', 'behavior', 'strongarm', 'approaches', 'solving', 'problems', 'most', 'teachers', 'reluctant', 'help', 'out', 'learn', 'adapt', 'Clark', 'soften', 'methods', 'bit', 'even', 'gains', 'sense', 'humor.Sadly', 'real', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'small', 'degree', 'gone', 'Hollywood', 'big', 'gig', 'nowadays', 'working', 'lecture', 'circuit', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'even', 'written', 'book', 'what', 'do', 'save', 'America', 'public', 'schools', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'speeches', 'found', 'rather', 'compelling', 'feel', 'talents', 'drive', 'are', 'best', 'suited', 'running', 'school', 'need', 'decisive', 'no-nonsense', 'leader', 'who', 'things', 'done.', 'Late']",Lean on Me
