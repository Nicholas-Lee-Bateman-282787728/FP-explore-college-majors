If you do have an interest in films from this period and you haven't yet seen &quot;Cleo&quot; then make a promise to yourself to see this film now. Director Agnes Varda made a movie back in 1960-61  that rises above language, time, place and fashion to be a masterpiece in world cinema. In some respects this is a neglected masterpiece as it is seldom spoken in the same breath as films like &quot;400 Blows&quot;, but that makes the pleasure of discovering it all the more sweet. Amongst the highlights - a gorgeous and clever score by Michel Legrand who makes a wonderful appearance as &quot;Bob, the Pianist&quot;; astonishing camerawork throughout - innumerable sequences that make you wonder &quot;how did they do that?&quot;. Varda is such an assured filmmaker that she can turn what at first appear to be momentary lapses of energy and inspiration into ever more revealing and moving climaxes. One of the great movies.

24199,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0780020464,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","`Cleo de 5 a 7' is a very soft film that thrives off of the layered performance given by the breathtaking Corinne Marchand.  In fact, Marchand's performance is so go that she often deceives the viewer into thinking they are watching a better film then they really are.  It's not that `Cleo de 5 a 7' is a bad film; it just doesn't feel complete to me.  It feels more like the beginning of something profound, and thus when the film ends I'm left wanting so much more.The film opens with Cleo visiting a psychic.  She's undergoing some health tests and is awaiting the results, and so she has her tarot cards read in order to predict their outcome.Is she doomed?After she leaves the psychic we follow her in real time as she prepares to see her doctor.  She sings (she's a professional singer), shops, eats, visits and eventually breaks down and reveals the fear dwelling inside her; a fear that is often misconstrued as selfishness.  Marchand gives Cleo vulnerability that I'm not sure the script or the film in general would have lent her, so I'm really happy she added those notes.  Despite the apparent hollowness of the film, Cleo becomes more and more human to us as the film progresses thanks to Marchand's expert delivery.I don't want to seem like I'm tearing the film apart, because I'm not.  The film is very enjoyable and it does manage to give the audience something to think and or talk about.  Cleo's unraveling is poignant and insightful when it comes to understanding the mental breakdown of someone awaiting this kind of new; but I find that the film doesn't take as full advantage of the prose at hand.  Like I mentioned, it seems to end too soon after it truly begins.Maybe this is the fault of the decision to make this a real time film; a film that compasses two short hours (less actually) and so the progression of character is limited to a single afternoon.  Personally, if the film had taken a wider scope and maybe started the film when the tests were first taken and then spanned over a few days while she awaited the results it could have been more effective.  I think this would have given the writers a chance to really flesh out the characters and give a new life to the film.Anyways, it isn't bad, it's just not great.  All of the acting is very good considering the lack of true character development in the script.  Sure, Marchand is the standout, and rightfully so, but the actors who play her friends all excel in there scenes and add glimmers of light to the film.  The practice scene in particular, where Cleo sings a new song she's been given, is stellar, and supports some very tender and emotionally convincing performances by everyone involved.I do wish a few changes had been made, because the prose is intriguing, and Marchand's delicate performance truly deserves better treatment.  I know that a lot of people adore this movie, and I enjoyed it, but I cannot help but express my feelings on the films overall effect.  It could have been much stronger.",3,Sometimes less is simply too little...,1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,2996,"['Cleo', '5', '7', 'very', 'soft', 'film', 'layered', 'performance', 'given', 'breathtaking', 'Corinne', 'Marchand', 'fact', 'Marchand', 'performance', 'so', 'go', 'often', 'viewer', 'thinking', 'are', 'watching', 'better', 'film', 'then', 'really', 'are', 'not', 'Cleo', 'de', '5', '7', 'bad', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'complete', 'more', 'beginning', 'something', 'profound', 'thus', 'when', 'film', ""'m"", 'left', 'wanting', 'so', 'much', 'more.The', 'film', 'Cleo', 'visiting', 'psychic', 'undergoing', 'health', 'tests', 'awaiting', 'results', 'so', 'tarot', 'cards', 'read', 'order', 'predict', 'outcome.Is', 'doomed', 'psychic', 'follow', 'real', 'time', 'see', 'doctor', 'professional', 'singer', 'shops', 'eats', 'visits', 'eventually', 'breaks', 'down', 'reveals', 'fear', 'dwelling', 'fear', 'often', 'misconstrued', 'selfishness', 'Marchand', 'Cleo', 'vulnerability', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'script', 'film', 'general', 'would', 'have', 'lent', ""'m"", 'really', 'happy', 'added', 'notes', 'apparent', 'hollowness', 'film', 'Cleo', 'more', 'more', 'human', 'film', 'thanks', 'Marchand', 'expert', 'delivery.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'seem', ""'m"", 'tearing', 'film', 'apart', ""'m"", 'not', 'film', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'manage', 'give', 'audience', 'something', 'think', 'talk', 'Cleo', 'unraveling', 'poignant', 'insightful', 'when', 'understanding', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'someone', 'awaiting', 'kind', 'new', 'find', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'full', 'advantage', 'prose', 'hand', 'mentioned', 'end', 'too', 'soon', 'truly', 'begins.Maybe', 'fault', 'decision', 'make', 'real', 'time', 'film', 'film', 'two', 'short', 'hours', 'less', 'actually', 'so', 'progression', 'character', 'limited', 'single', 'afternoon', 'Personally', 'film', 'had', 'taken', 'wider', 'scope', 'maybe', 'started', 'film', 'when', 'tests', 'were', 'first', 'taken', 'then', 'spanned', 'few', 'days', 'awaited', 'results', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'writers', 'chance', 'really', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'give', 'new', 'life', 'film.Anyways', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'considering', 'lack', 'true', 'character', 'development', 'script', 'Sure', 'Marchand', 'standout', 'rightfully', 'so', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'friends', 'excel', 'scenes', 'add', 'glimmers', 'light', 'film', 'practice', 'scene', 'particular', 'where', 'Cleo', 'new', 'song', 'been', 'given', 'stellar', 'very', 'tender', 'emotionally', 'convincing', 'performances', 'everyone', 'involved.I', 'do', 'wish', 'few', 'changes', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'prose', 'intriguing', 'Marchand', 'delicate', 'performance', 'truly', 'better', 'treatment', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'express', 'feelings', 'films', 'overall', 'effect', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'stronger']",N/A

But ""Cleo"" isn't a sad story about cancer, really. It's a charming story about how to live your life somewhere between the superficial and profound when something alarming happens.Cleo's a pop singer. She sings light ditties that get French radio play. She spends her time shopping for hats, hanging out in cafes, carrying on meaningless-if-romantic affairs with songwriters. She's beautiful. She's fashionable. On the surface, she looks like she's having a good time. And she usually is.This movie's about what she did in the two hours before receiving her prognosis from her doctor. Should she just go on and live life as if nothing's come along to trouble her? If she chooses to, how does she go about confronting her own mortality?Corinne Marchand, as Cleo, chooses both paths for her. As she wanders the streets of Paris, she plays Cleo as though she's unable to decide whether to be happy-go-lucky. Thus, the lush, beautiful film by Agnes Varda is both light and resonant, fun and meaningful.It's like an ""Amelie"" that will make you cry as well as laugh.Done in a style predating the French New Wave, it manages to be about how to go shopping when you may be about to die.And the Criterion release is just great.",5,One of my favorites of all time.,1040169600,"12 18, 2002",2002,1353,"['odd', 'know', 'call', 'film', 'charming', 'when', 'focus', 'woman', 'two', 'hours', 'waiting', 'finding', 'out', 'cancer', 'Cleo', ""n't"", 'sad', 'story', 'cancer', 'really', 'charming', 'story', 'how', 'live', 'life', 'somewhere', 'superficial', 'profound', 'when', 'something', 'alarming', 'happens.Cleo', 'pop', 'singer', 'sings', 'light', 'ditties', 'get', 'French', 'radio', 'play', 'time', 'shopping', 'hats', 'hanging', 'out', 'cafes', 'carrying', 'meaningless-if-romantic', 'affairs', 'songwriters', 'beautiful', 'fashionable', 'surface', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'usually', 'is.This', 'movie', 'what', 'did', 'two', 'hours', 'receiving', 'prognosis', 'doctor', 'Should', 'just', 'go', 'live', 'life', 'nothing', 'come', 'trouble', 'how', 'go', 'confronting', 'own', 'mortality', 'Corinne', 'Marchand', 'Cleo', 'paths', 'streets', 'Paris', 'Cleo', 'unable', 'decide', 'be', 'happy-go-lucky', 'Thus', 'lush', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Agnes', 'Varda', 'light', 'resonant', 'fun', 'meaningful.It', 'Amelie', 'will', 'make', 'cry', 'as', 'well', 'laugh.Done', 'style', 'predating', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'be', 'how', 'go', 'shopping', 'when', 'may', 'be', 'die.And', 'Criterion', 'release', 'just', 'great']",N/A

When, at five o'clock  she is told by a fortune-teller that she has only a short time left to live, it seems like a confirmation of her worst fears; that she must have cancer. Fully convinced she has received a death sentence, she spends the next two hours in a cloud of fear and depression. But, as Dostoevsky said when he too faced a death sentence; the imminence of death concentrates the mind wonderfully.A quite amazing amount of incident is packed into the next two hours. We stay with her through every minute in real time as, with a heightened sense of awareness, she visits friends, walks and drives around the bustling streets of Paris, and sits in some of the famous left-bank cafes listening to fragments of  conversation about painting, politics and philosophy to which at any other time she would have paid no attention. Everything reminds her of the short time she may have left to live. And to add to her woes she has an uncaring lover she can't confide in. ""I listen to his troubles."" she says, ""but he won't listen to mine. If I died tomorrow he'd be surprised but he wouldn't care. He's an egotist.""The way she discards her ridiculous wig and changes into an elegant black dress before walking out for the first time alone, is intended to convey a change of attitude and persona brought on by her fear that death is near. Up  to that point she had been just another frivolous pop-star without a serious thought in her head and under the dominion of her minder/manager. Now she is transformed into a confident, independent woman able to see the world through her own eyes.While walking in the park with only twenty minutes to go, she gets into conversation with Antoine, a soldier on leave, played by Antoine Bourseiller. He is funny, sensitive and articulate and they quickly build up a rapport. He is a great comfort to her.  When she unburdens herself to him, he says that as they are both going in the same direction he will go with her to the hospital.The film is extremely realistic. I'm sure no extras were employed. All the conversations she overhears in the crowded cafes were, I think, real conversations between real people, unaware that they were being filmed. The same seems true of the outdoor scenes, though I must say I was made to wonder about the extraordinarily handsome bus conductor - possibly the only unrealistic touch in the whole film.",5,The story of a concentrated mind.,981244800,"02 4, 2001",2001,2533,"['Cleo', 'singer', 'played', 'Corinne', 'Marchand', 'stomach', 'pains', 'awaiting', 'results', 'hospital', 'tests', 'seven', ""o'clock"", 'appointment', 'When', 'five', ""o'clock"", 'told', 'fortune-teller', 'only', 'short', 'time', 'left', 'live', 'confirmation', 'worst', 'fears', 'must', 'have', 'cancer', 'Fully', 'convinced', 'received', 'death', 'sentence', 'next', 'two', 'hours', 'cloud', 'fear', 'depression', 'Dostoevsky', 'said', 'when', 'too', 'faced', 'death', 'sentence', 'imminence', 'death', 'mind', 'wonderfully.A', 'quite', 'amazing', 'amount', 'incident', 'packed', 'next', 'two', 'hours', 'stay', 'minute', 'real', 'time', 'heightened', 'sense', 'awareness', 'friends', 'walks', 'around', 'bustling', 'streets', 'Paris', 'sits', 'famous', 'left-bank', 'cafes', 'listening', 'fragments', 'conversation', 'painting', 'politics', 'philosophy', 'other', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'paid', 'attention', 'Everything', 'her', 'short', 'time', 'may', 'have', 'left', 'live', 'add', 'woes', 'uncaring', 'lover', 'ca', ""n't"", 'confide', 'listen', 'troubles', 'wo', ""n't"", 'listen', 'mine', 'died', 'tomorrow', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'would', ""n't"", 'care', 'egotist', 'way', 'ridiculous', 'wig', 'changes', 'elegant', 'black', 'dress', 'walking', 'out', 'first', 'time', 'alone', 'intended', 'convey', 'change', 'attitude', 'persona', 'brought', 'fear', 'death', 'near', 'Up', 'point', 'had', 'been', 'just', 'frivolous', 'pop-star', 'serious', 'thought', 'head', 'dominion', 'minder/manager', 'Now', 'transformed', 'confident', 'independent', 'woman', 'able', 'see', 'world', 'own', 'eyes.While', 'walking', 'park', 'only', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'go', 'conversation', 'Antoine', 'soldier', 'leave', 'played', 'Antoine', 'Bourseiller', 'funny', 'sensitive', 'articulate', 'quickly', 'build', 'up', 'rapport', 'great', 'comfort', 'When', 'are', 'going', 'same', 'direction', 'will', 'go', 'hospital.The', 'film', 'extremely', 'realistic', ""'m"", 'sure', 'extras', 'were', 'employed', 'conversations', 'crowded', 'cafes', 'were', 'think', 'real', 'conversations', 'real', 'people', 'unaware', 'were', 'being', 'filmed', 'same', 'true', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'made', 'wonder', 'extraordinarily', 'handsome', 'bus', 'conductor', 'possibly', 'only', 'unrealistic', 'touch', 'whole', 'film']",N/A

Because, unlike in today first and only degree movies, there is so much in it. Not only in the dialogs, but also in the way Agn&egrave;s Varda has patiently built her movie ; just try to watch CLEO FROM 5 TO 7 while concentrating on what is behind the main action, observe the clocks that are always present and remind us Cl&eacute;o's fate, look at the stores punctuating Cl&eacute;o's race through the Paris of 1961.

With her and Ang&egrave;le, her guardian, you will learn how to read the signs that are surrounding you. The first scene of the movie, in a fortune-teller's apartment, is the only scene shot in colour and, in my opinion, a lesson of cinema.Music and songs take also an important place in Agn&eacute;s Varda's CLEO FROM 5 TO 7.

She fears the worst, that she has cancer and a short time to live.I found the pace of the film to be slow, and kept wishing for deeper character development.  I came away from the movie thinking that the concept was interesting, but that I never really got a strong feeling of what Cleo was going through -- she seemed overly superficial, as did her relationships with her friends and lover.

24206,A1V3S3Y5KAPPZW,0780020464,Eric Anderson,"[3, 3]","Much admired for its and experimental and technical ingenuity, Cleo from 5 to 7 is a beautiful work of a woman struggling between images of her public and private identity. I was lucky to see Agnes Varda introduce a screening of Cleo recently and she said that much of the directorial and experimental aspects of the film were made because it was cheap. This film is a fine example that tremendously powerful work can still be created under constrained circumstances. The division of the film into chapters persistently reminds the viewer that Cleo's time is soon to end like a fatal heroine in a book. Yet, her fate is more complex than that of heroines normally portrayed. First, it is never made clear that she will actually die or if she is deluding herself through superstitious beliefs. She is depicted as a beautiful and successful young woman who is being struck down at the height of her success, but she isn't fishing for sympathy exactly. What she is really fighting for is not her life, but her independence. She wants to be recognized as a complex and intelligent woman in her own right. People, primarily men, view her as talented, but stupid. This is the image she is constantly fighting against. Viewing and reviewing herself in mirrors and through the eyes of people she meets on the street. There is a dramatic split between the first half of the film and the second, where she transforms from a passive, dependent female to an active viewer examining her perception of herself. This is cleverly marked by her transformation in dress from white-clothed goddess with an elaborate wig to dark-clothed and shorthaired woman wandering the streets. Her walk in the couple hours of film is a fascinating examination of ways in which she is trying to view herself and become a participant in living rather than a dead image.",5,A Walking Image,980121600,"01 22, 2001",2001,1835,"['Much', 'admired', 'experimental', 'technical', 'ingenuity', 'Cleo', '5', '7', 'beautiful', 'work', 'woman', 'struggling', 'images', 'public', 'private', 'identity', 'was', 'lucky', 'see', 'Agnes', 'Varda', 'introduce', 'screening', 'Cleo', 'recently', 'said', 'much', 'directorial', 'experimental', 'aspects', 'film', 'were', 'made', 'was', 'cheap', 'film', 'fine', 'example', 'tremendously', 'powerful', 'work', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'created', 'constrained', 'circumstances', 'division', 'film', 'chapters', 'persistently', 'viewer', 'Cleo', 'time', 'soon', 'end', 'fatal', 'heroine', 'book', 'fate', 'more', 'complex', 'heroines', 'normally', 'portrayed', 'First', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'will', 'actually', 'die', 'deluding', 'superstitious', 'beliefs', 'depicted', 'beautiful', 'successful', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'being', 'struck', 'down', 'height', 'success', ""n't"", 'fishing', 'sympathy', 'exactly', 'What', 'really', 'fighting', 'not', 'life', 'independence', 'be', 'recognized', 'complex', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'own', 'right', 'People', 'primarily', 'men', 'view', 'talented', 'stupid', 'image', 'constantly', 'fighting', 'Viewing', 'reviewing', 'mirrors', 'eyes', 'people', 'street', 'dramatic', 'split', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'second', 'where', 'passive', 'dependent', 'female', 'active', 'viewer', 'examining', 'perception', 'herself', 'cleverly', 'marked', 'transformation', 'dress', 'white-clothed', 'goddess', 'elaborate', 'wig', 'dark-clothed', 'shorthaired', 'woman', 'wandering', 'streets', 'walk', 'couple', 'hours', 'film', 'fascinating', 'examination', 'ways', 'trying', 'view', 'become', 'participant', 'living', 'rather', 'dead', 'image']",N/A

The story goes through, in real time, the life of a famous French singer who is awaiting medical test results. The film follows her every move through Paris on the day she is to discover if she has a fatal illness. This film, directed by Agnes Varda, is one that was different from a lot of films from it's time. It was reminiscent of Italian Neo-Realism in that it used the streets of Paris as the set instead of a film studio. It also used available light and sound. Another way in which it is similar to Italian Neo-Realism is the handheld camera work. All of these things help the audience to feel as though they are right there in the streets of Paris taking a journey with the singer. I really enjoyed this film for many reasons, but one of the reasons I enjoyed the film the most is the characterization. I feel like the audience really gets to know Cleo and how she is feeling. We catch glimpses of her complexity through out the film. The difference in Cleo from scenes where she is speaking with her lover Jose to when she is arguing with her accompanist, shows the audience how many sides there are to her. Though on the outside she tries to be all put together, on the inside she is afraid. She says that the only reason to live is for beauty and when her youth and beauty are threatened, she does not quite know what to do. However, by the end of the movie, after having walked through Paris and observed people, Cleo realizes that there are more reasons to live than just for beauty and youth.

24209,A2D9TA1EYXA9KR,0780020464,"J. Kara Russell ""Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer""","[0, 0]","This is film that handles heavy topics with a very light touch.  Agnes Varda, known for some heavy hitting documentary style films, deftly manages to contrast social stratas and emotional life by contrasting two different styles of filmmaking.  The ""everyday Joe"" of Paris is contrasted with the beautiful elite young pop star, ""Cleo.""Cleo's life is depicted in high style scenes and situations; her self-focused, vaccuous thoughts in voice over, as well as those around her who are less priviledged.  Ultimately this is a film about the first time one becomes aware of mortality, when one looks at the faces of the elderly in a clear and different way, looking for answers.Michel Legrand plays himself as a composer for this budding star, and he does the score which is wonderful.  While the stand-out hit from this score was ""Cri d'amour"" (aka ""Sans toi""), I was much more impressed with the main theme song, and the way he weaves it in very different styles throughout the film.  It echos her footsteps at the opening, it becomes a lute-like love song that interweaves with Sans Toi, and it is Cleo's big brassy pop song on the jukebox.  (If this is Corinne Marchand's own voice, she is magnificent - a marvelous rich alto.)With all this going for this film, I have to admit it remains light and unfortunately forgettable.  I was almost to the very last scene when I realized I had seen this film only about 3 years ago and had completely forgotten it.  Cleo is so beautiful that it is hard to care about her, even if she is awakening to deeper thoughts.

The two films, CLEO and CARNIVAL, were made right around the same time, 1962, otherwise it would be safe to say that Agnes Varda must have studied Herk Harvey's horror masterpiece for strategies on how to portray her heroine's gradual disintegration.  Both films use subtle sound cues (as well as sound cues that hit you right over the head!) and both Hilligoss and Corinne Marchand play musicians (Michel Legrand's churning, relentless score is all over the place, Marchand mouthing several numbers).  As Cleo traipses through the boulevards, she comes across some pretty freakish sights that have been little commented on when people speak of Cleo's ""charm"" and ""wit,"" as if to prove that flaneurs don't necessarily enjoy a Maurice Chevalier experience of life, not when they're delirious and that elegant b/w photography goes all Weegee on a person.  Cleo's trying to keep it together when she sees the man who swallows frogs--big live frogs, one after the other, as the camera stares at him, hypnotized as she is.  He's shown as the peasant type, the guy from the countryside whose class is so low he has made himself into a freak for public consumption.  You wonder how he gets so many of those frogs down, it's totally disgusting.  Then he performs the money shot: tipping slightly at the waist, he evacuates them all in a solid spray of projectile vomit, white and greenish like the cold waves lapping at the fishermen's boots in Victor Hugo's TOILERS OF THE SEA.  Cleo puts a fist over her own mouth and her eyelids flutter close.  I haven't seen anything as freakish since season one of 30 Rock, the episode where Tracy Jordan is impersonating Star Jones on TGS with Tracy Jordan, stuffing his/her face with a thousand forbidden treats then throwing them all up like a vertical geyser across the studio kitchen, while Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin look on in what I now understand to be a subtle homage to Varda's nightmarish vision.The other disturbing scene in CLEO occurs in a different neighborhood a few reels later, but Cleo's still reeling herself!  There's a man running up to her proffering his bare forearm, through which he's worked what looks like two or three yards of waxed fishing line, which he pulls in and out of the suppurating flesh.  It's like a burst of grand guignol still extant in the pop 1960s Cleo lives in, and again, she freaks out, -- anybody would.  It's bad enough when you're walking around Paris and a flasher opens his raincoat, but these men are anticipating the body modification movement of the 1980s and it's uncanny.",5,Freaks of the Underworld,1209600000,"05 1, 2008",2008,2854,"['Cleo', 'streets', 'Paris', 'shock', 'prognosis', 'ordinary', 'sights', 'sounds', 'streets', 'attain', 'spectral', 'radiance', 'fact', 'disconnect', 'reality', 'make', 'seem', 'poor', 'girl', 'CARNIVAL', 'OF', 'SOULS', 'played', 'incomparable', 'Candace', 'Hilligoss', 'two', 'films', 'CLEO', 'CARNIVAL', 'were', 'made', 'right', 'same', 'time', '1962', 'would', 'be', 'safe', 'say', 'Agnes', 'Varda', 'must', 'have', 'studied', 'Herk', 'Harvey', 'horror', 'masterpiece', 'strategies', 'how', 'portray', 'heroine', 'gradual', 'disintegration', 'films', 'use', 'subtle', 'sound', 'cues', 'as', 'well', 'sound', 'cues', 'hit', 'right', 'head', 'Hilligoss', 'Corinne', 'Marchand', 'play', 'musicians', 'Michel', 'Legrand', 'churning', 'relentless', 'score', 'place', 'Marchand', 'mouthing', 'several', 'numbers', 'Cleo', 'traipses', 'boulevards', 'pretty', 'freakish', 'sights', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'commented', 'when', 'people', 'speak', 'Cleo', 'charm', 'wit', 'prove', 'flaneurs', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'enjoy', 'Maurice', 'Chevalier', 'experience', 'life', 'not', 'when', ""'re"", 'delirious', 'elegant', 'b/w', 'photography', 'Weegee', 'person', 'Cleo', 'trying', 'keep', 'together', 'when', 'man', 'who', 'frogs', 'big', 'live', 'frogs', 'one', 'other', 'camera', 'hypnotized', 'shown', 'peasant', 'type', 'guy', 'countryside', 'class', 'so', 'low', 'made', 'freak', 'public', 'consumption', 'wonder', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'frogs', 'down', 'totally', 'disgusting', 'Then', 'money', 'shot', 'tipping', 'slightly', 'waist', 'solid', 'spray', 'projectile', 'vomit', 'white', 'greenish', 'cold', 'waves', 'lapping', 'fishermen', 'boots', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'TOILERS', 'THE', 'SEA', 'Cleo', 'fist', 'own', 'mouth', 'eyelids', 'flutter', 'close', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'freakish', 'season', 'one', '30', 'Rock', 'episode', 'where', 'Tracy', 'Jordan', 'impersonating', 'Star', 'Jones', 'TGS', 'Tracy', 'Jordan', 'stuffing', 'face', 'thousand', 'forbidden', 'treats', 'then', 'throwing', 'up', 'vertical', 'geyser', 'studio', 'kitchen', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'look', 'what', 'now', 'understand', 'be', 'subtle', 'homage', 'Varda', 'nightmarish', 'vision.The', 'other', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'CLEO', 'different', 'neighborhood', 'few', 'reels', 'later', 'Cleo', 'still', 'reeling', 'man', 'running', 'up', 'proffering', 'bare', 'forearm', 'worked', 'what', 'two', 'three', 'yards', 'waxed', 'fishing', 'line', 'suppurating', 'flesh', 'burst', 'grand', 'guignol', 'still', 'extant', 'pop', '1960s', 'Cleo', 'lives', 'again', 'out', 'anybody', 'would', 'bad', 'enough', 'when', ""'re"", 'walking', 'Paris', 'flasher', 'raincoat', 'men', 'are', 'anticipating', 'body', 'modification', 'movement', '1980s', 'uncanny']",N/A

Initially it is unclear whether the diagnosis is to be made my a medical doctor or by a tarot reader.  In any case the potential illness prompts Corinne to indulge in recurrent journeys around Paris in automobiles, most notably a Citroen DS, and this provides for some marvellous footage.  She also regales us with some banal but amusing popular songs.

Life does not seem so blissful from 5 to 7 though, because in this time she waits on the results of a medical test to determine if she has cancer or not. With such a troubling situation on her hands, she finds it hard to concentrate on music or her egotistic lover (Jos&eacute; Luis de Villalonga). Instead, she takes the time into her own hands and experiences the world in a way she hasn't for a long time.Director Jean-Luc Goddard makes an appearance in a silent film parody. It is actually really funny, despite being campy and ridiculous.Normally when I think of New Wave films, I think of pretentiousness and ars gratia artis in the literal sense. However, this movie is genuinely moving and interesting to watch. Artistically, it is revolutionary. Varda employs elements of style that are rare in even today's cinema. Her use of jump cuts can be jarring, but they help set a mood. The hand held camera provides a sense of realism. The camera seems to always be moving, providing a sense of fluidity and chaos. However, the overall mood is that of peace and serenity, not chaos. Most of the scenes are shot outdoors in natural light. One feels the heat of the summer and the energy of the public on the street. Audiences can't help but feel a wonderful sense of being alive. This is what makes Cleo From 5 to 7 so watchable; it leaves the viewer feeling vibrant and happy.

Varda captures The French New Wave genre with this film. Following Cleo throughout one very eventful day is a very interesting experience for the viewer. There is not one sequence or shot of the film that isn't worth studying. The film has many intriguing undertones such as the meaning of life, the role of self-obsession, the function of despair and loneliness. The film follows Cleo, a pop singer, as she wanders around Paris waiting for her medical results. The results may tell her if she will live a long life or have numbered days. The cinematography and camera angles are exquisite and revolutionary. Along with the stunning jump cuts, Varda beautifully incorporates symbolism with every shot. One of the most memorable sequences is when Cleo comes home to her apartment and imitates the many cats in her apartment as she crawls around. The subtext of this decision is quite powerful:  Cleo is on the prowl, she is scoping out her life by dominating the lives of others, as she faces despair and loneliness. Varda's film is revolutionary and is timeless. Finding comfort in the soldier she meets at Parc Montsouris, Cleo finds meaning and purpose in life. The two characters are in stark difference to each other but they share a connection for they are quite alone in the world. It is an interesting look on the portrayal of women and how women are regarded within society. The taxi driver that Cleo and her assistant take after purchasing a black hat on a Tuesday is a woman; this is an interesting choice in that it illustrates all the dynamics of vocations.

In brief, it chronicles two hours in the life of Cleo, a singer, as she waits for the results of tests that will diagnose her stomach ailment.  Starting with the brief Tarot Card reading (in color) -- spoiler alert -- the prediction that Cleo faces death, the film reverts to black and white.  But what a masterpiece of black and white photography!The adventures of Cleo during the two hours (real time and cinematic time) of waiting reveal the gradual peeling away of her narcissism.  Another alert reviewer spoke about &quot;reading&quot; this film.  He gave as an example the time on the clocks every time Cleo walks by one.  An even more subtle and more telling example of how the visual images express the plot development and the transformation of the main character is in the reflections seen in windows and mirrors.  During her more narcissistic moments at the beginning of the film we note that every time Cleo walks by a window we see her reflection, and she often notices it as well.  As the film progresses the reflections in windows and mirrors gradually diminishes.  By the end of the film there are no more windows and mirrors and Cleo is just her human self -- without the added narcissistic reflections.In the last twenty minutes or so of the film Cleo has what approximates an unpretentious reloationship with an ordinary fellow, a soldier on leave who is about to return to his unit to fight in Algeria.  He agrees to accompany her to the hospital where she is about to get her test results.  When they arrive the doctor is not there.  In resignation they walk out only to encounter the doctor leaving in his car.  He coldly and abruptly announces that indeed Cleo has a bad diagnosis and that treatment will be starting shortly.Cleo takes this news with surprising serenity, in keeping with the transformation from her narcissistic and hysteroid personality at the beginning of the story to the more mature person she has been shown to have become.  The soldier says to her that he wishes he could be there for her during the treatment.  She replies that he is with her now.  Cleo, during those two hours, has learned that the only thing she has is the present.If this sounds like a &quot;downer&quot; in my description, please let me assure you that this is a very affirmative film.  And as I mentioned earlier, it is a masterpiece example of how subtle visual clues advance the story and its underlying theme.  Varda is an outstanding director.A note on the DVD itself.

In this intelligent 90 minute classic comedy/drama from French director Agnes Varda, wife of better-known French director Jacques Demy (THE  UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG), young singer Cleo (Corrine Marchand) nervously walks the Paris streets as she awaits the results of her cancer biopsy.  The film, which was a French/Italian co-production, with production honors going to Carlo Ponti, was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, at which it received several awards.Cleo's a beautiful girl, and director Varda, in an interview among the extras available on the disk, says that her film divides in two parts.  At first, Cleo goes out in a lovely, colorful dress, and Paris, ""le tout Paris,"" as the French say, looks admiringly at her.  Then the star changes into a little black dress, and when she goes out again, she actually looks at the city, as she ponders the meaning of life in general and her life in particular.  Her observations here offer a close look at the city's rich and varied street life.  Her despair is lightened when she meets Antoine, (Antoine Bourseiller), a young soldier on his way back to Algeria.Michel Legrand, composer of the beloved score of THE UMBRELLAS, plays Bob, the pianist who brings Cleo new songs: he provided the score for this film as well.  Jose Luis de Vilallonga plays the young woman's lover.  Legendary French director Jean-Luc Godard, and well-known actors Anna Karina and Jean-Claude Brialy  make uncredited cameo appearances as the actors in  ""Les fianc&eacute;s du pont Mac Donald ou (M&eacute;fiez-vous des lunettes noires),"" (1961) , the silent film short shown to Cl&eacute;o, which was also made by director Varda.  Varda was always adept at capturing the street life of Paris, and the city looks beautiful in CLEO, shown in both black and white and color.  This inexpensively made movie was filmed sequentially, in real time, for better or worse, on its actual streets.  Cleo's walk can be traced on a map of the town, which, to be sure, looked quite different back then than it does now, as another of the disk's helpful extras shows.The film's rather mild, and perhaps not ultimately memorable, but it's worth a look, especially if you'd like to see Paris as it was back then, and if you've the patience for subtitles.

You have to see it, hear it, and think it about to truly experience it. It was directed by Agn&egrave;s Varda in 1962.  It is an innovative film that is still fresh and relevant. It paints a beautiful picture of city life on the move.  The fast paced urban experience of random chance is captured and expressed well in this film. In a city you never really know what is out there until you go look.  It takes place in Paris and might remind you of a random afternoon spent in any major city. An experience to remember will not be far. This artistic film is about a character named Cleo. She is beautiful, popular, talented, and possibly going to die soon. She has an illness and is awaiting to hear from her doctor regarding how bad it actually is. She spends the evening interacting with friends and wandering the city.  She is worried and unsure about her fate.  This really is a very cool, stylish, unique film for many reasons.  Cleo is a pop singer and she works on a new song with her creative team.  Her friend is a model and she poses for artistic creation.  Cleo meets a man randomly in the park and possibly falls in love.  The list goes on.

Floating on the mood  of doubt she has accumulated (which won't be allayed until the test results  come in), she sees things with new eyes, becomes deeper and less  superficial, and eventually meets up with a chance stranger who gently  goads her into a new type of romance.Varda's film isn't exactly  &quot;eccentric,&quot; &quot;difficult&quot; or &quot;intellectual&quot; as  some New Wave films are, but then it's nowhere near trite or simplistic  either. Above all, it's just an amazingly beautiful and poetic film, and,  of course, very romantic in a patented French way.

But all that changes with medical testing for cancer ...What follows won't satisfy those looking for a complex plot, or overt drama. It's the simplicity of the next 90 minutes, of seeing the world as if for the first time, of experiencing life with fresh eyes, that makes this such a wonderful film.At first Cleo is busily killing time, do her best to occupy her mind with something other than the unbearable wait for the test results. Her fear is very close to the surface, bubbling up at times, only to be tamped down as quickly as possible.But then she gradually begins to live in the moment, appreciating all that's around her, realizing just how rich & precious every minute of life truly is. And by the time the test results are in, she's ready to face those results, whatever they might be. Even if death is her fate, she's already been reborn.All of this is conveyed in black & white images so clear & vivid that they shimmer with life. We begin by watching Cleo, but end by sharing her reawakened soul. Many ""life-affirming"" films are anything but, rubbing the viewer's face in superficial, unearned sentimentality -- this one succeeds by taking an almost casual, quietly joyous approach.

24224,A2H387XJ67U0CA,0780020464,Zia Haider,"[0, 0]","Cleo From 5 to 7 is director Agnes Varda's story about a woman,awaiting the results of her cancer screening, wandering the streets of Paris. Cleo comes off at first as a superficial woman, her entire feeling of self-worth tied to her beauty. However as the film progresses Cleo begins to realize the simple joy in living,abandons her friends who insist she is simply a spoiled child, and meets a soldier in a park who she begins a romance with. The movie unfolds almost in real time with chapters that divide each portion of each hour, following the character from 6:05-6:12 p.m. for example. Its a great film for anyone who wants to watch a French New Wave film thats easy enough for the everyday movie goer to understand but still possesses a great level of depth.",4,A great French New Wave Film,1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,766,"['Cleo', '5', '7', 'director', 'Agnes', 'Varda', 'story', 'woman', 'awaiting', 'results', 'cancer', 'screening', 'wandering', 'streets', 'Paris', 'Cleo', 'off', 'first', 'superficial', 'woman', 'entire', 'feeling', 'self-worth', 'tied', 'beauty', 'However', 'film', 'Cleo', 'realize', 'simple', 'joy', 'living', 'friends', 'who', 'insist', 'simply', 'spoiled', 'child', 'soldier', 'park', 'who', 'romance', 'movie', 'almost', 'real', 'time', 'chapters', 'divide', 'portion', 'hour', 'following', 'character', '6:05-6:12', 'p.m.', 'example', 'great', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'watch', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'film', 'thats', 'easy', 'enough', 'everyday', 'movie', 'goer', 'understand', 'still', 'great', 'level', 'depth']",N/A
