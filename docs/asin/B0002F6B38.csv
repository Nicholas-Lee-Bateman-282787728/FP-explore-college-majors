832605,A16XRPF40679KG,B0002F6B38,Michael Dobey,"[1, 1]","Not everything can have lots of depth. This show certainly is fast paced and entertaining and yet we don't really get to know much about the people in it.This show which ran in 1972 holds up well as a spy show although we don't know who the protectors work for. They are against drug smugglers though and that's enough to tell you that they are the good guys.  This show aims to give you a thrill ride often and it delivers and it reminded me of todays action movies in which character is put in the back seat to the overall action.  Robert Vaughn of course adds his acting prowless to this and that helps as he is the leader of the group. His chain smoking countess assistant? , is as good with a gun and her fists as any man too.  So if you are in the mood for some face paced spy or crime fighter shows then you'll be ok on that level. This is no Callan though which is a realistic spy show but a james bond done in 30 minutes type of exploit. So on that level it deserves 4 stars for being well made and entertaining. but as others pointed out if  you put this on the drama scale it would probably be 2 stars because we just don't get any feeling for the characters often , or why things are happening. They needed a hour to expand this show and it would have been a really good bondian spy show.

832606,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0002F6B38,Only-A-Child,"[3, 10]","""The Protectors"" was a British television show (ITC) back in 1972-74. It was an attempt to capture the spirit of ""The Avengers"" and ""The Saint"", and to capitalize on Robert Vaughn's fading ""The Man From UNCLE"" popularity.The best part of the show was its catchy ""Avenues and Alleyways"" theme song played at the beginning and ending of each 24-minute episode. New viewers will find even 24 minutes too long as the low budget and lack of talent (both writing and acting) doom things from an entertainment perspective, unless you can find unintended humor in the idea of an action adventure show in which action and adventure are conspicuously absent.Vaughn plays Harry Rule, a member of a three-person team of freelance troubleshooters based in Europe. A fair amount of each 24-minute episode is taken up by scenic ""establishment"" shots to make it appear that the show was produced on location in a variety of exotic European locales.Harry appears to be the leader of the group, if only because he has the most screen time (although slightly less than the amount devoted to the establishing shots). Tony Anholt plays the gadget guy (today he would be the team nerd). He is definitely a third wheel, rarely starring in an episode and by the second season rarely even appearing.My theory is that ""The Protectors' target audience was nursing home residents with bad hearts, who wanted to see a secret agent type show but could not survive exposure to things like action, suspense, humor and hot romance.Which is about the only way to account for the casting of Myree Dawn Porter as a character called the Contessa di Contini. Despite her exotic name, the Contessa was about as antiseptic and sterile as a wax figure. It is likely that the character was meant to be a slightly more sophisticated version of Emma Peale, but the Contessa avoids all action and contributes nothing in the humor, parody, or seduction departments.Since the popularity of this type of show requires a fair degree of sensual energy, the nursing home explanation is the only way to account for the casting of an actress in her late 30's, especially one clearly showing a lot of mileage. She was certainly no Alexandra Bastedo (""The Champions"") and the show's frequent close-ups of her face were not a good idea.If you have nothing better to do than watch this series, watch for the absence of young attractive actresses (a staple of every Saint and UNCLE episode) as villains or heroines. Apparently Porter had a contract clause specifying that no ""featured"" actress could be younger than her; and they wonder why these things don't get better ratings.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",2,As Antiseptic and Sterile as Its Heroine,1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,2666,"['Protectors', 'was', 'British', 'television', 'show', 'ITC', 'back', '1972-74', 'was', 'attempt', 'capture', 'spirit', 'Avengers', 'Saint', 'capitalize', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'fading', 'Man', 'UNCLE', 'popularity.The', 'best', 'part', 'show', 'was', 'catchy', 'Avenues', 'Alleyways', 'theme', 'song', 'played', 'beginning', 'ending', '24-minute', 'episode', 'New', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'even', '24', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'low', 'budget', 'lack', 'talent', 'writing', 'acting', 'doom', 'things', 'entertainment', 'perspective', 'can', 'find', 'unintended', 'humor', 'idea', 'action', 'adventure', 'show', 'action', 'adventure', 'are', 'conspicuously', 'absent.Vaughn', 'plays', 'Harry', 'Rule', 'member', 'three-person', 'team', 'freelance', 'troubleshooters', 'based', 'Europe', 'A', 'fair', 'amount', '24-minute', 'episode', 'taken', 'up', 'scenic', 'establishment', 'shots', 'make', 'appear', 'show', 'was', 'produced', 'location', 'variety', 'exotic', 'European', 'locales.Harry', 'be', 'leader', 'group', 'only', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'slightly', 'less', 'amount', 'devoted', 'establishing', 'shots', 'Tony', 'Anholt', 'gadget', 'guy', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'team', 'nerd', 'definitely', 'third', 'wheel', 'rarely', 'starring', 'episode', 'second', 'season', 'rarely', 'even', 'appearing.My', 'theory', 'Protectors', 'target', 'audience', 'was', 'nursing', 'home', 'residents', 'bad', 'hearts', 'who', 'wanted', 'see', 'secret', 'agent', 'type', 'show', 'could', 'not', 'survive', 'exposure', 'things', 'action', 'suspense', 'humor', 'hot', 'romance.Which', 'only', 'way', 'account', 'casting', 'Myree', 'Dawn', 'Porter', 'character', 'called', 'Contessa', 'di', 'Contini', 'exotic', 'name', 'Contessa', 'was', 'about', 'antiseptic', 'sterile', 'wax', 'figure', 'likely', 'character', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'slightly', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'version', 'Emma', 'Peale', 'Contessa', 'avoids', 'action', 'nothing', 'humor', 'parody', 'seduction', 'departments.Since', 'popularity', 'type', 'show', 'fair', 'degree', 'sensual', 'energy', 'nursing', 'home', 'explanation', 'only', 'way', 'account', 'casting', 'actress', 'late', '30', 'especially', 'one', 'clearly', 'showing', 'lot', 'mileage', 'was', 'certainly', 'no', 'Alexandra', 'Bastedo', 'Champions', 'show', 'frequent', 'close-ups', 'face', 'were', 'not', 'good', 'idea.If', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'watch', 'series', 'watch', 'absence', 'young', 'attractive', 'actresses', 'staple', 'Saint', 'UNCLE', 'episode', 'villains', 'heroines', 'Apparently', 'Porter', 'had', 'contract', 'clause', 'specifying', 'featured', 'actress', 'could', 'be', 'younger', 'wonder', 'why', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'ratings.Then', 'again', 'what', 'do', 'know', ""'m"", 'only', 'child']",The Protectors - Season One

However, the 30 minute format of the series precludes any significant character or plot development, and ultimately results in a less than satisfying result.

832610,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B0002F6B38,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[1, 1]","Gerry Anderson's ""The Protectors"" probably debuted a few years too late -- one of those sweeping shows of international intrigue, it has a 60s vibe that by the 1970s didn't get the full production it deserved.  Robert Vaughn, himself an icon of the previous decade, stars as Harry Rule, ostensibly the American leader of a group of European guardian angels in the vein of Leslie Charteris' ""The Saint.""  What makes ""The Protectors"" particularly interesting is its half-hour format, mandating that stories be wrapped up in far less time than an adventure series usually has.  The results are mixed, though generally good and occasionally compelling.  Certainly ""Seinfeld"" 25 years later showed it was possible to tell a compelling albeit humorous story in less than 30 minutes, and in the same way, most episodes of this series manage to cut out the filler that pads too many hour-long programs.While Vaughn's career would take a turn into frequent onscreen villainy, here he remains the smooth, intelligent hero, with less panache than his memorable Napoleon Solo but frequently given more opportunity to stretch his considerable acting talent. Tony Anholt's almost impossibly handsome sidekick, Paul Buchet, and the lovely Nyree Dawn Porter, perhaps the last thinking-man's babe, never show up Vaughn in a cast that is as good looking as it is talent.  Location scenes, though, seem a little subdued, as the series was shot on 16 mm with the muted cinematography that became more common once the 60s was over.  That aspect of the production is probably is least appealing, offset to some degree by a catchy theme song that became a lasting hit for the Tom-Jones-ish crooner Tony Christie.",4,"Good, But Would Have Been Better in the 60s",1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,1689,"['Gerry', 'Anderson', 'Protectors', 'probably', 'debuted', 'few', 'years', 'too', 'late', 'one', 'sweeping', 'shows', 'international', 'intrigue', '60s', 'vibe', '1970s', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'full', 'production', 'deserved', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'icon', 'previous', 'decade', 'Harry', 'Rule', 'ostensibly', 'American', 'leader', 'group', 'European', 'guardian', 'angels', 'vein', 'Leslie', 'Charteris', 'Saint', 'What', 'Protectors', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'half-hour', 'format', 'mandating', 'stories', 'be', 'wrapped', 'up', 'far', 'less', 'time', 'adventure', 'series', 'usually', 'results', 'are', 'mixed', 'generally', 'good', 'occasionally', 'compelling', 'Certainly', 'Seinfeld', '25', 'years', 'later', 'showed', 'was', 'possible', 'tell', 'compelling', 'albeit', 'humorous', 'story', 'less', '30', 'minutes', 'same', 'way', 'most', 'episodes', 'series', 'manage', 'cut', 'out', 'filler', 'too', 'many', 'hour-long', 'programs.While', 'Vaughn', 'career', 'would', 'take', 'turn', 'frequent', 'onscreen', 'villainy', 'here', 'smooth', 'intelligent', 'hero', 'less', 'panache', 'memorable', 'Napoleon', 'Solo', 'frequently', 'given', 'more', 'opportunity', 'stretch', 'considerable', 'acting', 'talent', 'Tony', 'Anholt', 'almost', 'impossibly', 'handsome', 'sidekick', 'Paul', 'Buchet', 'lovely', 'Nyree', 'Dawn', 'Porter', 'perhaps', 'last', 'thinking-man', 'babe', 'never', 'show', 'up', 'Vaughn', 'cast', 'as', 'good', 'looking', 'talent', 'Location', 'scenes', 'though', 'seem', 'little', 'subdued', 'series', 'was', 'shot', '16', 'mm', 'muted', 'cinematography', 'became', 'more', 'common', '60s', 'was', 'over', 'aspect', 'production', 'probably', 'least', 'appealing', 'offset', 'degree', 'catchy', 'theme', 'song', 'became', 'lasting', 'hit', 'Tom-Jones-ish', 'crooner', 'Tony', 'Christie']",The Protectors - Season One
