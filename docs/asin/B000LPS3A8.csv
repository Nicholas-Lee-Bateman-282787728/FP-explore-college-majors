She hardly says a word but her presence is captivating(no pun intended). One of my problems with the story was with the old man and how his character was written, without giving away too much, he took the girl when she was very young intending to marry her when she got older, in short, he kidanpped her! Yet he brings back people to his boat to fish, people who seem to know all about what he did and no one seems to care or turn him into the police?! Until the girl takes a liking to a young man, then things get a little more realistic.

Kim Ki Duk's film are mood driven pieces and you always feel the emotion he brings. Like his last couple of flicks there really isn't that much dialouge from his main charachters. He tells the story through expression and you feel the charachter's pain, joy, and loss. The story is of a man who wants to wed a younger female. He is a fortune teller and he knows that his time is almost up. I sat in awe the entire time watching this film. The soundtrack is worth the price of admission.

1040005,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000LPS3A8,,"[7, 8]","Kim Ki-Duk is a very acclaimed director from Korea. He is responsible for Korean Masterpieces: THE ISLE, SPRING SUMMER FALL.., TIME, BAD GUY, 3-IRON and some others. This director's style is that he expresses his films with very little dialogue, he intends the actors, actresses to express the story through the expression of raw emotion. You may say his films are a bit on the ""artsy"" side, but for me, his films deal with the frailties of the human spirit, man's weaknesses and their ability to adapt.The story centers around an old man in his sixties who has been raising a young girl(Han Yeo Reum, Samaritan girl) since childhood on a ship that floats unanchored off Korea's coastline. The girl hasn't been outside the confides of the boat and as a result, her world are obviously quite limited, but still she seems satisfied and happy, and the old man plans to marry her the day she reaches legal age. The two make their living by hosting fishermen aboard the boat, and also tell fortunes in a rather bizarre and dangerous fashion, by shooting arrows whizzing past the girl's head into a Buddhist painting on the side of the boat. Afterwards, the girl whispers in the old man's ear the 'said' fortune. (This method of fortune-telling appears to have been invented by Kim, though possibly inspired by the common practice of dropping a dart onto a spinning disc as I've read)The film opens in striking fashion with a shot of the weapon that inspired the film's title. When fitted with an additional piece, the bow becomes a stringed instrument. Sadly, however, the instrument doesn't fit into the film's plot beyond providing for occasional mood music. The Bow is utilized more often as a means of fending off lecherous fisherman from manhandling the young girl, who braves the elements in a flimsy dress, and who (like all the women in Kim's films) is pretty gorgeous. Most of the fishermen gossip that the old man supposedly kidnapped the young girl when she was too young to remember. Soon, however, a sensitive male college student shows up on board and develpos a liking for the girl. The old man discovers he's going to need more than a bow if he wants to keep the delectable young thing for himself.Kim's mostly common approach to expression is to set the story in an isolated or a marginalized world, usually a physical space or a way of life(like 3-IRON, Time), places that certain specific rules and customs would apply. Examples are the floating temple in Spring.., the red light district in Bad Guy, the lake in the Isle, the motel in the Bird Inn, etc. The delight of watching his films come from exploring and coming to understand these worlds, the applied rules and how they operate.In the Bow, we see that the bow itself is a means of defense for the old man and the girl in a series of repeating incidents. It characterizes the ""society"" of the boat by showing first, a man's skill with the bow, and then how the girl's spatial knowledge of the boat and archery skills is a second line of defense.These scenes don't add to character depth, and compounded by the fact that they hardly talk to each other, while much of the film shows the old man and the girl growing more emotionally detached, all they can do is trade angry/annoyed stares at each other. (over and over again, again and again)It gets a little repetitive after a while, however, the strong performances of the two leads does help the film along. You can really observe that one building emotion within.Kim's style with the limited dialogue approach hampers this film, it comes more like a gimmick and not an integral part of the film. The lack of words by the lead characters(because they hardly know each other) in THE ISLE and 3-IRON worked very well because they could communicate emotionally and the silence accentuates their strange bond. Kim's approach to his film ""TIME"" would have served well in the ""The Bow"".I have the Korean Region-3 release, and from experience, I know Tartan will utilize the transfer from this dvd. The Korean release is almost 122 minutes long, I'm not sure how long the U.S. version is, specs say 90 minutes, I'm not sure.PICTURE: Anamorphic Widescreen. The transfer is fitting to the film. It is sharp and has good black levels. Some scenes have a bit more grain than others do.AUDIO/SUBTITLES: Korean 5.1 DD and DTS. The subtitles are well timed and executed.EXTRAS: Trailers, Interviews, commentary.In Closing: Although ""The Bow"" it is not one of Kim Ki-duk's best, it is very much still worth a look. Always approach his films when you are in a certain mood. You will not be able to figure this one out until its climax.Done perfect or not, Kim Ki-Duk always takes you on a ride. As with most of his films, the ending is pretty much open to the viewer's interpretation. Whether you take it literally or as a metaphor(that's how I took it) is entirely up to you, it is the beauty of Kim's film making.RECOMMENDED!!",4,"Not Kim Ki-Duk's best, but good

It's certainly a topic that will raise some eyebrows, and when I read the cover of the DVD, I was intrigued, not before encountering such a topic.The old man and beautiful young girl live on a fishing boat and earn their money from the tourists who are charged to fish on the boat.  The story is well-known, why is an old man with a beautiful young  girl, and the girl is teased about the situation.  A young college student becomes the center of attention for the young girl, and challenged by the old man.  He promises that the girl's family is looking for her and he cannot take her right to live a normal life.The BowA fine bow and arrow is used for various reasons, one ... to shoot and threaten any man who gets too close to the girl.  The girl and the old man are sharp shooters.  It is also used to predict fortunes of the tourists who ask.  For this,  the old man aims  at the girl on a swing,  but strategically misses her and reveals fortunes.  The third use of the bow is for beautiful music.UneasinessWe know the man is set to marry the girl, and the only indication we have that he has crossed the line is when he gives her a bath.  We see him washing her back, but are quick to assume,  there is more crossing the line that we only speculate.The FilmPeriodically, in foreign film, there are some unusual situations that are a departure from the norm.  In this case, it was filmed on an old boat, there is minimal dialogue.  The man and the girl do not communicate loudly;  if they do, it is a whisper to one another.One thing the director did reveal was that he had several actresses in mind to play the young girl, but due to the morality of the film, old man, young girl and beneath the surface, they declined.This is a good film, with a unique and surprising fantasy ending.

He makes his living bringing men to his boat who want to fish on the weekend. Most of the men assume that the nubile girl is the man's granddaughter, but that doesn't deter them from making sexual advances toward her, or even from attempting to rape her. Luckily, the old man and the girl easily foil these advances with the skillful use of bows and arrows.But one day, a month shy of the wedding, a nice, handsome young man comes to the boat and things get complicated. He and the wordless girl instantly like each other, and a little research on the mainland reveals that the girl's parents have been looking for their missing daughter for ten years. But instead of bringing the police to the boat, the young man comes back alone and asks the old man to let her go, saying that he is being selfish and unfair to her. He doesn't agree - surprise! - but he finally agrees to let her go.Just when it looks like the girl is going back to the mainland to reunite with her parents and have a normal life, the old man tries to kill himself and the girl decides to marry him after all - out of love, gratitude, or pity I do not know. They marry themselves in a self-serve ceremony, with the young man as a witness. After the wedding, the old man plays the erhu, serenading his child-wife to sleep. He then dives into the ocean and drowns himself, but his ghost comes back in the form of an arrow and proceeds to consummate the marriage, with the young man watching as the girl writhes and moans, finishing with a bright red stain of conjugal blood on her virginal white gown.I won't argue with anyone who says that this is an art film. It is a film of moods, emotions, and compelling visual images. But let's be honest and admit that it comes down to a child porn fantasy, that doesn't cross any legal lines. The old man doesn't really care about the girl and he is obviously sexually obsessed with her, and in a very calculated and evil way he has fashioned the girl to be naive, innocent, compliant, and sensual - the perfect sort of girl that a child molester dreams about. I am amazed that no other reviewer has pointed out this aspect of the film, and no amount of ""artsiness"" or ""genius"" can hide it.Do I have a dirty, cynical mind and am I missing the whole point, or the whole metaphor, of this story? I don't think so, if you consider that this film reminded me of another foreign film which is one of my favorites, and has a similar theme - Woman of the Dunes, a 1964 Japanese film. I welcome comments from those who disagree with me, but I would ask that you watch Woman of the Dunes first.",1,Child porn fantasy,1255046400,"10 9, 2009",2009,3060,"['man', 'sixties', 'who', 'boat', 'ocean', 'many', 'miles', 'coast', 'Korea', 'six-year-old', 'girl', 'prisoner', 'ten', 'years', 'planning', 'marry', 'seventeenth', 'birthday', 'will', 'continue', 'live', 'boat', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'who', 'scanty', 'clothes', 'even', 'cold', 'windy', 'days', 'evening', 'naked', 'tub', 'warm', 'water', 'smiling', 'sensuously', 'old', 'man', 'lovingly', 'living', 'bringing', 'men', 'boat', 'who', 'want', 'fish', 'weekend', 'Most', 'men', 'assume', 'nubile', 'girl', 'man', 'granddaughter', ""n't"", 'deter', 'making', 'sexual', 'advances', 'even', 'attempting', 'rape', 'Luckily', 'old', 'man', 'girl', 'easily', 'advances', 'skillful', 'use', 'bows', 'arrows.But', 'one', 'day', 'month', 'shy', 'wedding', 'nice', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'boat', 'things', 'get', 'complicated', 'wordless', 'girl', 'instantly', 'other', 'little', 'research', 'mainland', 'girl', 'parents', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'missing', 'daughter', 'ten', 'years', 'instead', 'bringing', 'police', 'boat', 'young', 'man', 'back', 'alone', 'old', 'man', 'let', 'go', 'saying', 'being', 'selfish', 'unfair', ""n't"", 'agree', 'surprise', 'finally', 'let', 'go.Just', 'when', 'girl', 'going', 'back', 'mainland', 'reunite', 'parents', 'have', 'normal', 'life', 'old', 'man', 'kill', 'girl', 'marry', 'love', 'gratitude', 'pity', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'marry', 'self-serve', 'ceremony', 'young', 'man', 'witness', 'wedding', 'old', 'man', 'erhu', 'serenading', 'child-wife', 'sleep', 'then', 'ocean', 'drowns', 'ghost', 'back', 'form', 'arrow', 'proceeds', 'consummate', 'marriage', 'young', 'man', 'watching', 'girl', 'writhes', 'moans', 'finishing', 'bright', 'red', 'stain', 'conjugal', 'blood', 'virginal', 'white', 'gown.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'argue', 'anyone', 'who', 'art', 'film', 'film', 'moods', 'emotions', 'compelling', 'visual', 'images', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'admit', 'down', 'child', 'porn', 'fantasy', ""n't"", 'cross', 'legal', 'lines', 'old', 'man', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'girl', 'obviously', 'sexually', 'obsessed', 'very', 'calculated', 'evil', 'way', 'fashioned', 'girl', 'be', 'naive', 'innocent', 'compliant', 'sensual', 'perfect', 'sort', 'girl', 'child', 'molester', 'am', 'amazed', 'other', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'aspect', 'film', 'amount', 'artsiness', 'genius', 'can', 'hide', 'it.Do', 'have', 'dirty', 'cynical', 'mind', 'am', 'missing', 'whole', 'point', 'whole', 'metaphor', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'consider', 'film', 'reminded', 'foreign', 'film', 'one', 'favorites', 'similar', 'theme', 'Woman', 'Dunes', '1964', 'Japanese', 'film', 'welcome', 'comments', 'who', 'disagree', 'would', 'ask', 'watch', 'Woman', 'Dunes', 'first']",The Bow

If you know Kim Ki-Duk and are a fan of him, you are getting exactly what you're expecting: slow-paced, minimal dialogue, minimalism in filmmaking, and visual & musical poetry. His films never require a synopsis, as they are not necessarily about what happens in the film but more about the journey you go through in his films. And this film is no exception; all you need to know about this film is that it revolves around a young girl who's been taken care of by an old man. Even if you aren't a fan of Kim Ki-Duk and this is your first film you are encountering, I'd say give it a watch. This is everything opposite of what the mainstream cinema is spewing out constantly. And this film is what real cinema is all about.",5,Letting the bird leave the nest.,1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,760,"['brilliant', 'film', 'Kim', 'Ki-Duk', 'know', 'Kim', 'Ki-Duk', 'are', 'fan', 'are', 'getting', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'slow-paced', 'minimal', 'dialogue', 'minimalism', 'filmmaking', 'visual', 'musical', 'poetry', 'films', 'never', 'require', 'synopsis', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'what', 'film', 'more', 'journey', 'go', 'films', 'film', 'exception', 'need', 'know', 'film', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'taken', 'care', 'old', 'man', 'Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Kim', 'Ki-Duk', 'first', 'film', 'are', 'encountering', ""'d"", 'say', 'give', 'watch', 'everything', 'opposite', 'what', 'mainstream', 'cinema', 'spewing', 'out', 'constantly', 'film', 'what', 'real', 'cinema']",The Bow
