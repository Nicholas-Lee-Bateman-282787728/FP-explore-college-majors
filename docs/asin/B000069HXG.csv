Grace Brothers, headed by &#34;Young Mr. Grace&#34; (Harold Bennett - who was born in 1899), never seems to be without a bit of trouble.  The episode Up Captain Peacock illustrates this perfectly.  Captain Peacock, after serving 20 years with Grace Brothers, is awarded the key to the executive washroom.  One might think &#34;no big deal&#34;, but it is to the floor staff of Grace Brothers.  After all, Capt.

707454,A14BTJRH9VNLJJ,B000069HXG,Kurt A. Johnson,"[1, 1]","Are You Being Served? is the story of the staff of the Ladies&#8217; and Gentlemen&#8217;s Wear departments in Grace Brothers department store. While customer&#8217;s come and go, the staff fights each other and their incompetent superiors with laughs all around. The stories are hilarious and are generally clean, though a running gag involves one lady&#8217;s constant frettings about her pussy (cat). So, this tape can be watched with younger ones, but some discretion should be exercised.Nonetheless, this is a great Britcom, one of the classics.
