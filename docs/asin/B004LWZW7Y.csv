1416380,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004LWZW7Y,A kids review,"[1, 3]","Based on the downward trajectory of the Shrek franchise, particularly over its final two installments, one wouldn't have expected much from a spinoff film starring one of the peripheral characters. Puss in Boots, therefore, was a pleasant surprise for me. Starring Antonio Banderas as the voice of the titular feline, Puss is sort of a prequel to the Shrek films, following the adventures of its swashbuckling star as he teams up with Humpty Dumpty and Kitty Softpaws to take on Jack and Jill for their magical beans. Bubbling with wry wit, visual sparkle, and effervescent charm, Puss in Boots helps restore some luster to the Shrek universe. You won't see anything especially new or thought-provoking here, but you'll probably have a pretty good time nonetheless.",4,Puss in Boots,1329782400,"02 21, 2012",2012,765,"['Based', 'downward', 'trajectory', 'Shrek', 'franchise', 'particularly', 'final', 'two', 'installments', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'expected', 'much', 'spinoff', 'film', 'starring', 'one', 'peripheral', 'characters', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'therefore', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Starring', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'voice', 'titular', 'feline', 'Puss', 'sort', 'prequel', 'Shrek', 'films', 'following', 'adventures', 'swashbuckling', 'star', 'up', 'Humpty', 'Dumpty', 'Kitty', 'Softpaws', 'take', 'Jack', 'Jill', 'magical', 'beans', 'Bubbling', 'wry', 'wit', 'visual', 'sparkle', 'effervescent', 'charm', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'restore', 'luster', 'Shrek', 'universe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'especially', 'new', 'thought-provoking', 'here', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'time', 'nonetheless']",Puss in Boots

1416389,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004LWZW7Y,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I'm in the group that isn't ashamed to say that they loved and still love `Shrek'.  Our faction is dying off and is being replaced by a growing group of individuals that refuse to admit they were initially smitten and instead insist on claiming the film to be a saccharine mess with no redeemable value and worthy of nothing but scorn.  Seriously, if you do not know of the existence of this group then please visit any film discussion forum and you will find thousands of them.  Saying all of this; I am also not afraid to point out that after the initial moment of animated bliss, this franchise has nosedived.  The second `Shrek' was a bore, the third a minor upstep and then that fourth was a total abomination.I was skeptical about Puss getting his own gig.Thankfully, this film is a complete treasure.  Think what you will and balk all you want, but `Puss in Boots' is actually better than `Shrek' ever was because it has more grounded focus, better jokes (that are less pop culture heavy and more solidified in their own origins) and crisper animation.  Also, I love the way that the film isn't afraid of creating a villain that isn't completely wicked.  I have a pet peeve with children's films that center on the epitome of cruel.  I mean, I love `Toy Story 3' as much as the next guy, but did Lotso really have to be that wicked, so wicked as to attempt to murder the toys that just saved his life?  So, I was very pleased to see a redemption take place here that made the film feel more kid friendly.Yes, the names Puss and Soft Balls are an obvious crude humor joke directed at the adults in the room, but I let that one slide.Seriously, this one is SO good.  Any fan of animation, fairy tales, the cast or the original `Shrek' will eat this up.  Antonio should stick to cartoons, and Mr. Galifianakis is on a roll!  The plot, which incorporates Jack and Jill as well as Jack and the Beanstalk is clever, witty and comes full circle, and the big reveal sequence concerning Humpty Dumpty (complete with slow motion flashback) was spot on perfection and left me in complete stitches.

Skillfully, with gorgeous animation, colourful characters, and impeccable voice work, the movie tells the untold story of our favourite feline bandito - the one and only Puss...in Boots! Set in sandy deserts, dust-swept towns, and with a distinctive Fistful of Dollars feel, Puss in Boots accomplishes something impressive indeed; being a smart film, entertaining for both kids and adults, with an emotional core that satisfies younger audiences and critics, I call Puss in Boots a success!This is in no small part to the fantastic, detailed, atmospheric, rich world that our characters live in. Thanks no doubt in part to executive producerGuillermo del Toro'spracticed eye for atmosphere, lush detail, and stunning cinematography. Watching the movie, one is reminded of Sergio Leone's Man With No Name Trilogy, with several clever nods to famous spaghetti westerns present, and the old Zorro TV shows, including Antonio Banderas' fantasticThe Mask Of Zorro.But visually is not the only area Puss in Boots succeeds. The voicework is incredibly good.Zach Galifianakisis excellent as the shifty Humpty (Alexander) Dumpty., andSalma Hayekis also impeccable as Kitty Soft-Paws, a literal cat burglar. While the rest of the cast is beyond criticism, the real star (once again) here isAntonio Banderas, whose silky-smooth, charismatic voice lends great gravitas and charm to the adventure-seeking, boot-wearing, milk-lapping, sword-wielding, fast-talking eponymous Puss in Boots.The story is nothing new or groundbreaking, nor is the movie especially weighty or dramatic, but for kids, and even for adults savvy enough to catch the references, Puss in Boots is an entertaining, action-packed, funny, witty, gorgeously animated adventure!

We all went together and saw it in the theater and... man, were we disappointed. The script really wasn't up to snuff, with a thin backstory for Puss, lackluster performances overall, and a strained, somewhat mechanistic, clunky plotline. The whole thing felt forced, insincere and uninspired. The Humpty Dumpty character was unpleasant for the sake of unpleasantness, and the ""twist"" of his being the bad guy was so predictable I had a dream about it a week before the movie came out.

Why is it that the first sequel to a series is always as ugly as an Ogre in the mud?  But then, when there is a third in a series, it usually cleans itself up and redeems itself?  The ""Shrek"" and ""Men in Black"" series are good examples of this.But ""Puss in Boots"" (PIB) is a spinoff of ""Shrek"" I believe, and when PIB first released, I saw that quite a few critics seemed to believe that PIB was better than Shrek.  So, since I really liked Shrek, I was pretty psyched to watch this film.  Suffice it to say that I was more than mildly disappointed with PIB.While the Shrek series was very clever in the way that it mixed modern day pop culture with older fairly tale creatures, this movie seems to just throw some characters in, well, just to throw them in.  The humor here just didn't seem to always land on its feet -- to risk using a bad cat metaphor -- but rather fell flat on its back.  And worse, there are just WAY too many double crosses here between the main characters.  At one point I thought to myself, ""OK, Puss.  I can buy the fact that you gave Humpty Dumpty another chance, but a third, maybe even a fourth?""

The title character Puss in Boots is of course from the Shrek movies. They flesh out his character and history more here and add others such as Humpty Dumpty, the ex-best friend, and Kitty Softpaws, a female romantic interest for Puss.Puss, Humpty, and Kitty conspire to steal magic beans so they can grow the beanstalk and take the goose that lays golden eggs. Puss is doing it so he can right a wrong - he wants to pay back the town which he unintentionally betrayed. Humpty has seemingly been obsessed with finding the magic beans since he was very young, and he's brought Kitty along as a master thief. Puss was best friends with Humpty years ago until Humpty betrayed him, so he enters into this new alliance somewhat uneasily.In addition to the movie, the discs include a new short film featuring Puss. It's less than half an hour long but extremely funny. Puss ends up with three kittens to oversee and they're a lot more trouble than they look.

It continues the Shrek tradition of mashing fairy tales together while turning them on their heads, producing memorable characters and lots of funny moments.  Much of the comedy is drawn from Puss's Latin lover personality and lampooning actual feline behavior.

Yet, the Shrek series has continued to turn out strong, witty movies. Puss in Boots even succeeds in taking the franchise beyond Shrek and the Ogres, focusing on fan favorite Puss in Boots. As a film, Puss in Boots is distinct from the Shrek films, but keeps the same lovable wit and spoofs on classic fairy tales.The plot of Puss in Boots involves everybody's favorite cat joining Humpty Dumpty in a quest to steal magic beans from Jack and Jill. It works by and large. There are quite a few laugh out loud moments. Two things prevent me from giving it a fifth star. First, the scriptwriters opted to go for a ""conspiracy  theory"" ending. I won't say any more for fear of spoiling it, but it doesn't seem to follow from the rest of the movie. Second, I thought Puss' love interest was a bit too typical.

So when I learned that he was getting his own film I was all about. When it was released to theaters there I was along with my girl and little cuz to check it out, I loved it. So then I was waiting for the DVD or Blu-Ray to hit the streets. When I finally did I went straight out and bought it that day, naturally we watched it that night.Puss is an outlaw just living his life by his own code until he runs into another thief who is as good as him. After hunting this person down through the streets he learns what this other cat is all about, she is Kitty Soft Paws. She is also working for someone who Puss knows very personally, Humpty Alexander Dumpty. As it turns out Humpty needs Puss&#8217;s help to fulfill a childhood fantasy that they both once shared. Puss doesn&#8217;t know if he can trust his old friend but adventure waits if he takes the chance.I absolutely loved this movie and have watched it various times since I have bought it. The animation looks great as DreamWorks always brings it. The writing was good as this was a very fun movie that even us adults will enjoy.

Kind of odd for what I thought was a family movie. Must be trying to appeal to the adults, but there must have been better ways.That's a shame, because the rest is quite entertaining, especially how the movie makes fun of Puss himself - chasing reflected light, lapping up his leche, etc.It's a story about friendship, disappointment, and redemption, with some scary villains (Jack and Jill). It's also genuinely touching.Some of the sequences (such as the dance-off) could have been much shorter, but that's a quibble.

1416460,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004LWZW7Y,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 4]","- Jill, dangling Puss in Boots in the air: ""Is it true that cats always land on their feet?""- Puss in Boots: ""No! That is just a rumor spread by dogs!""He is sometimes known as ""El Diablo Gato"" or ""Furry Lover"" or even ""Chupacabra."" But legend will call him ""Puss... in Boots!"" Those wondering how this spinoff movie will work out can rest easy. PUSS IN BOOTS isn't as emotionally rich, won't resonate as deeply as recent animated classics like the TOY STORY franchise or FINDING NEMO or even UP. But it is humongously diverting. It showcases Antonio Banderas in fine voice and at his most playful. And the script knows better than to engage in dropping tired pop culture references. You'll run across a few more familiar - okay, maybe tweaked - figures from them classic nursery rhymes.The story regales us with a tale of derring-do from Puss in Boots' past, before he met Shrek. An extended flashback sequence reveals Puss's origins, that as a kitty he was found at the doorstep of an orphanage in the dusty, sun-baked village of San Ricardo. There, he meets the bullied egg-child Humpty Alexander Dumpty. Their friendship and Humpty's obsession with finding the legendary magic beans provide the lynchpin of the story. The flashback also records Humpty's transitioning from good to rotten egg. Puss in Boots had always been prone to daring heroics and his glowing rep soon eats up Humpty. Eventually we witness their parting of ways. It's not on friendly terms.There's a lot of clever sight gags in this film. My favorite would have to be the marvelous dance fight between Puss and a rival masked feline out to poach his latest score. Is it stunt casting when Salma Hayek fits her role so perfectly? She plays Kitty Softpaws, thief extraordinaire. This marks the fifth pairing up of Banderas and Hayek (after DESPERADO, FRIDA, SPY KIDS 3D: GAME OVER, and ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO). Recall that Puss is not only a swashbuckling adventurer, he is also a notorious great lover. When his estranged childhood chum Humpty Dumpty tries to enlist him for an audacious heist, it's Humpty's partner-in-crime, Kitty Softpaws, who convinces an amorous Puss to sign up. And the caper? It concerns stealing the magic beans from those murderous married outlaws, Jack and Jill. And then it's up the beanstalk and on to the giant's castle to nab the golden goose.It's obvious that Banderas relishes spoofing himself. Puss in Boots is easily the most popular character in the SHREK franchise, and Banderas's charm easily carries the sword-slinging cat's solo outing, Latin machismo warring wonderfully with the innate cuteness of a cat in friggin' boots. Supporting Banderas and Hayek are some pretty solid names, Zach Galifianakis providing the voice of Humpty Dumpty, Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris as the felonious, southern twangy crooks Jack and Jill, and Guillermo del Toro as the village comandante.As in the best of these ventures, there's something for the young and old. Them kids will eat up the wild antics on screen while adults will appreciate the sly humor that sails over the four-year-old's head. Case in point, when Puss is tossed in stir and the jailer finds his catnip, Puss claims that it's for his glaucoma. Ha. The computer graphics are at such an advanced level nowadays that it's almost worth mentioning only when the work comes in below par. Suffice it to say that PUSS IN BOOTS, full of good humor and grand adventure, is a visual treat. Puss in Boots is never more in his element. It may be that I'll resent his playing second or third fiddle to Shrek from this moment on.",4,"""If it is to be a dance fight, then I choose to dance fight you to the death!""",1321228800,"11 14, 2011",2011,3590,"['Jill', 'dangling', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'air', 'true', 'cats', 'always', 'land', 'feet', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'No', 'just', 'rumor', 'spread', 'dogs', 'sometimes', 'known', 'El', 'Diablo', 'Gato', 'Furry', 'Lover', 'even', 'Chupacabra', 'legend', 'will', 'call', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'wondering', 'how', 'spinoff', 'movie', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'can', 'rest', 'easy', 'PUSS', 'IN', 'BOOTS', ""n't"", 'emotionally', 'rich', 'wo', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'as', 'deeply', 'recent', 'animated', 'classics', 'TOY', 'STORY', 'franchise', 'FINDING', 'NEMO', 'even', 'UP', 'humongously', 'diverting', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'fine', 'voice', 'most', 'playful', 'script', 'better', 'engage', 'dropping', 'tired', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', ""'ll"", 'run', 'few', 'more', 'familiar', 'okay', 'maybe', 'tweaked', 'figures', 'classic', 'nursery', 'rhymes.The', 'story', 'regales', 'tale', 'derring-do', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'past', 'met', 'Shrek', 'extended', 'flashback', 'sequence', 'reveals', 'Puss', 'origins', 'kitty', 'was', 'found', 'doorstep', 'orphanage', 'dusty', 'sun-baked', 'village', 'San', 'Ricardo', 'bullied', 'egg-child', 'Humpty', 'Alexander', 'Dumpty', 'friendship', 'Humpty', 'obsession', 'finding', 'legendary', 'magic', 'beans', 'provide', 'lynchpin', 'story', 'flashback', 'also', 'Humpty', 'transitioning', 'good', 'rotten', 'egg', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'prone', 'daring', 'heroics', 'glowing', 'rep', 'soon', 'up', 'Humpty', 'Eventually', 'witness', 'parting', 'ways', 'not', 'friendly', 'lot', 'clever', 'sight', 'gags', 'film', 'favorite', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'marvelous', 'dance', 'fight', 'Puss', 'rival', 'masked', 'feline', 'poach', 'latest', 'score', 'stunt', 'casting', 'when', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'role', 'so', 'perfectly', 'Kitty', 'Softpaws', 'thief', 'extraordinaire', 'fifth', 'pairing', 'Banderas', 'Hayek', 'DESPERADO', 'FRIDA', 'SPY', 'KIDS', '3D', 'GAME', 'OVER', 'ONCE', 'A', 'TIME', 'IN', 'MEXICO', 'Recall', 'Puss', 'not', 'only', 'swashbuckling', 'adventurer', 'also', 'notorious', 'great', 'lover', 'When', 'estranged', 'childhood', 'chum', 'Humpty', 'Dumpty', 'enlist', 'audacious', 'heist', 'Humpty', 'partner-in-crime', 'Kitty', 'Softpaws', 'who', 'amorous', 'Puss', 'sign', 'up', 'caper', 'stealing', 'magic', 'beans', 'murderous', 'married', 'outlaws', 'Jack', 'Jill', 'then', 'up', 'beanstalk', 'giant', 'castle', 'nab', 'golden', 'goose.It', 'obvious', 'Banderas', 'spoofing', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'easily', 'most', 'popular', 'character', 'SHREK', 'franchise', 'Banderas', 'charm', 'easily', 'sword-slinging', 'cat', 'solo', 'outing', 'Latin', 'machismo', 'warring', 'wonderfully', 'innate', 'cuteness', 'cat', 'friggin', 'boots', 'Supporting', 'Banderas', 'Hayek', 'are', 'pretty', 'solid', 'names', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'providing', 'voice', 'Humpty', 'Dumpty', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'felonious', 'southern', 'twangy', 'crooks', 'Jack', 'Jill', 'Guillermo', 'del', 'Toro', 'village', 'comandante.As', 'best', 'ventures', 'something', 'young', 'old', 'Them', 'kids', 'will', 'eat', 'up', 'wild', 'antics', 'screen', 'adults', 'will', 'appreciate', 'sly', 'humor', 'four-year-old', 'head', 'Case', 'point', 'when', 'Puss', 'tossed', 'stir', 'jailer', 'catnip', 'Puss', 'glaucoma', 'Ha', 'computer', 'graphics', 'are', 'advanced', 'level', 'nowadays', 'almost', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'only', 'when', 'work', 'par', 'Suffice', 'say', 'PUSS', 'IN', 'BOOTS', 'full', 'good', 'humor', 'grand', 'adventure', 'visual', 'treat', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'never', 'more', 'element', 'may', 'be', ""'ll"", 'resent', 'playing', 'second', 'third', 'fiddle', 'Shrek', 'moment']",Puss in Boots

While the franchised was loved till the very end, Shreks recent outings have been more of an after thought. Sloppier and genrally less fun than Shreks 1 & 2, the final two weren't bad by any means, just a tad redunt. Luckily the studio realized this, as well as the fact that there was two foot four gold mine starring in their second Shrek title, so they gave him his own well deserved film.What we're left with is the greatness that is Puss in Boots, a movie about one of the series most iconic characters, yet only garnered minimum time on the big screen in the shadows of Shrek and Donkey, especially in the latter two films. Rest easy, the big green lug and his noble steed are nowhere to be seen in this film. The film benifits from this, as you need no previous Shrek knowledge to understand Puss, which is a good thing.Finally, as for the actual film, its undeniably well excuted. Who've thought that the studio originally had this film planned as another direct-to-video spin off when the final product is this good? They simply put alot of effort into it, and it shows with its dazzling visuals and surprising deep and implemented characters and somewhat emotional plot. When its all said and done, I really couldn't find anything noticably wrong or flawed in it, which is hard for me to do. One could make the arguement that its just another cash-in on the Shrek franchise by giving us more time with one of favorite cats, but when the movie is this good, its hard to argue.I highly recomend this film because, in an already overtaxed franchise, a breath of fresh air a fun and stylish as this isn't so bad.",5,The Beloved Cat Leaves a Beloved Film for Us,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,1758,"['loved', 'Shrek', 'extent', 'grand', 'total', 'four', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'numerous', 'spin', 'shorts', 'even', 'amusment', 'park', 'rides', 'franchised', 'was', 'loved', 'very', 'end', 'Shreks', 'recent', 'outings', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'thought', 'Sloppier', 'genrally', 'less', 'fun', 'Shreks', '1', '2', 'final', 'two', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'means', 'just', 'tad', 'redunt', 'Luckily', 'studio', 'realized', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'was', 'two', 'foot', 'four', 'gold', 'mine', 'starring', 'second', 'Shrek', 'title', 'gave', 'own', 'well', 'deserved', ""'re"", 'left', 'greatness', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'movie', 'one', 'series', 'most', 'iconic', 'characters', 'yet', 'only', 'garnered', 'minimum', 'time', 'big', 'screen', 'shadows', 'Shrek', 'Donkey', 'especially', 'latter', 'two', 'films', 'Rest', 'easy', 'big', 'green', 'lug', 'noble', 'steed', 'are', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'film', 'film', 'benifits', 'need', 'previous', 'Shrek', 'knowledge', 'understand', 'Puss', 'good', 'thing.Finally', 'actual', 'film', 'undeniably', 'well', 'excuted', 'Who', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'studio', 'originally', 'had', 'film', 'planned', 'direct-to-video', 'spin', 'when', 'final', 'product', 'good', 'simply', 'put', 'alot', 'effort', 'dazzling', 'visuals', 'surprising', 'deep', 'implemented', 'characters', 'somewhat', 'emotional', 'plot', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'noticably', 'wrong', 'flawed', 'hard', 'do', 'One', 'could', 'make', 'arguement', 'just', 'cash-in', 'Shrek', 'franchise', 'giving', 'more', 'time', 'one', 'favorite', 'cats', 'when', 'movie', 'good', 'hard', 'argue.I', 'highly', 'recomend', 'film', 'already', 'overtaxed', 'franchise', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'fun', 'stylish', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad']",Puss in Boots

Actually he's after some magic beans... Or... Oh rats! It's too complicated to go into here, but suffice it to say, our favorite gato hits a few snags along the way. Replay your DVD from Amazon if you want to figure it out.Of course, we have a lot of amigos to help:* Antonio Banderas (""Haywire"") is our eponymous orange tabby, resourceful, macho and (trying to be) trustworthy.* Salma Hayek (""Grown Ups"") is Kitty Softpaws (she's been de-clawed), a tough but oh so gentle, little gray and white pussycat. She's also a bit of a flirt.* Zach Galifianakis (""Due Date"") is Humpty Dumpty; with friends like this, who needs... Oh, you know... (...but I liked that ingenuous little sprinkle of freckles...)* Billy Bob Thornton (""Faster"") is Jack (of Jack and Jill notoriety). This dastardly duo blasts around the frontier in a wagon pulled by a team of javalinas.* Amy Sedaris (lots of TV) is Jill, Jack's better (?!) half. They are after the goose that laid the golden egg (see above).I loved the Latino-flavored soundtrack, the flamenco dances, the swashbuckling sword fights, the dash across open country from a cat's-eye level, and, above all, being amazed by the subtle nuances displayed on each character's face. Today's animators are brilliant, they know how to capture emotion, speech, and movement, all true to each personality.Children will get a big kick out of the story and the action, while adults will appreciate the artistry and the humor. &iexcl;El gato con botas es gran diversi&oacute;n!",4,&iexcl;El gato con botas es gran diversi&oacute;n!,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,1627,"['little', 'orphaned', 'Puss', 'order', 'help', 'adopted', 'mother', 'off', 'quest', 'find', 'goose', 'laid', 'golden', 'egg', 'Actually', 'magic', 'beans', 'Oh', 'rats', 'too', 'complicated', 'go', 'here', 'say', 'favorite', 'gato', 'few', 'snags', 'way', 'Replay', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'want', 'figure', 'out.Of', 'course', 'have', 'lot', 'amigos', 'help', '*', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Haywire', 'eponymous', 'orange', 'tabby', 'resourceful', 'macho', 'trying', 'be', 'trustworthy', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'Grown', 'Ups', 'Kitty', 'Softpaws', 'been', 'de-clawed', 'tough', 'so', 'gentle', 'little', 'gray', 'white', 'pussycat', 'also', 'bit', 'flirt', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'Due', 'Date', 'Humpty', 'Dumpty', 'friends', 'who', 'Oh', 'know', 'liked', 'ingenuous', 'little', 'sprinkle', 'freckles', '*', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Faster', 'Jack', 'Jack', 'Jill', 'notoriety', 'dastardly', 'duo', 'blasts', 'frontier', 'wagon', 'pulled', 'team', 'javalinas', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'lots', 'TV', 'Jill', 'Jack', 'better', 'half', 'are', 'goose', 'laid', 'golden', 'egg', 'see', '.I', 'loved', 'Latino-flavored', 'soundtrack', 'flamenco', 'dances', 'swashbuckling', 'sword', 'fights', 'dash', 'open', 'country', ""cat's-eye"", 'level', 'being', 'amazed', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'displayed', 'character', 'face', 'Today', 'animators', 'are', 'brilliant', 'know', 'how', 'capture', 'emotion', 'speech', 'movement', 'true', 'personality.Children', 'will', 'get', 'big', 'kick', 'story', 'action', 'adults', 'will', 'appreciate', 'artistry', 'humor', 'iexcl', 'El', 'gato', 'con', 'botas', 'es', 'gran', 'diversi', 'oacute']",Puss in Boots

This film is not of that caliber.  In fact, without Selma Hayek, this film wouldn't have sold half of what it has.  The story is about Humpty Dumpty meeting up with Puss, and Humpty Dumpty just happens to have a close friend named Kitty Soft Paws.  They are seeking the magic beans that grow the beanstalk all the way up to the cloud castle where the goose is that lays the golden eggs.  If I'm spoiling this film for you, then you just might be shallow enough to enjoy it.  There are SOME short parts that are good, and the film ends well for everybody, but it just isn't the caliber of the Shrek films.  This isn't a prequel to Shrek, and it isn't a spin-off.  It is a story all its own that HAPPENS to include the character Puss In Boots, almost LIKE the character in Shrek.  They might as well have made it a completely different character and used somebody else besides Antonio Banderas.

Its beautiful fake Mexican desert landscape, and its shadowy dens of iniquity, make a gorgeous screen picture. And its characters require few jokes, as such, to hit on a lot of gut-busting humor. High art this ain't, but it sure is fun.Long on the run, but looking for redemption, Puss takes on the one job he hoped would never come his way. But on the way to the big payoff, he runs across Kitty Softpaws, the craftiest pickpocket in the land, and his old friend, Humpty Dumpty. Puss and Humpty have a history going way back. They reluctantly join forces in the hopes of completing a childhood goal, but not everyone is sharing all their secrets.Like the Shrek films this character comes from, this movie blends several different fairy tales and nursery rhymes, upending your expectations and juxtaposing real life with magical logic. Its combination of childhood playfulness and sly grown-up humor will attract a broad, smart audience.

Directed by Shrek The Third director Chris Miller, the film tells the historical take of the origins of Puss In Boots as masterfully voiced by Antonio Banderis. I must admit I was expecting the sight gags and 'inside jokes' that all the Shrek films had - but this film dragged the story and scenes a little for me.It did have some great re-occuring gags and some sight tricks, but overall didn't have the character draw and strong story for me. Selma Heyak plays Kitty Softpaws, a very funny and extremely talented female version of Puss. Their chemistry is fun and some of the Dance choreography between both their fighting snd the dancing was quite fun and hysterical. Humpty Dumpty (Voiced by Zach Galifianakis) is the 'crux' of the story and as such isn't as dynamic as Puss and Kitty. However Billy Bob Thorton and Amy Sedaris play the irreverant and oddest couple of all - Jack and Jill. They are hysterical.The adventure is fun and once the quest gets moving - the film begins momentum. However, the ending was somewhat of a short one for me...a nice little nod to the Shrek world would have been nice, but I can see where there might be a sequal.

1416526,A1SC682D5FO0KC,B004LWZW7Y,Matthew Schwarz,"[12, 13]","This movie is a fun mix of various fairy tale references and the Zorre-esque Puss In Boots character from the Shrek films.  We basically get here the origins of the Puss character and an early adventure of his.  It has the general fun and atmosphere of the Shrek movies while having its own identity - it's full of lots of humor, but with a good adventure story to keep the plot moving.There are several things that this movie could've totally blown but got spot-on right.  The creators made the right move in focusing on one character from the Shrek movies in his own feature, and they definitely made the right choice of characters - Puss is likeable and amusing and has enough substance to pull of the lead role.  As a music lover, I was particularly pleased with the flamenco-ish soundtrack (featuring Rodrigo & Gabriela) that added to the overal cultural flavor, as opposed to the modern pop music of Shrek.  Similarly, the ""Zorro"" similarities with the title character was matched with a Mexican setting and appropriate accents (except by the annoying  American accent of Humpty Dumpty, which dind't fit in at all, and I don't remember any explanation in the movie of why someone raised from a small child in an orphanage would not have the same accent as those he grew up around).  The movie didn't try to fit in innapropriate references to characters that didn't belong (as in, for example, ""Muppet Babies"", where a bunch of characters we'd seen meet for the first time as adults are now seen hanging out as children).  So, you won't see Shrek or Donkey, but Puss does just fine on his own (and the movie maybe flows a little better without the increasingly over-the-top slapstick of the later Shrek films).  In fact, this movie definitely has a different feel than Shrek, with a little less of a focus on mixing modern pop-culture references with a fantasy setting, although those elements are still there.Definitely worth watching and I hope it spawns a series of films of its own.",4,Good fun,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,1991,"['movie', 'fun', 'mix', 'various', 'fairy', 'tale', 'references', 'Zorre-esque', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'character', 'Shrek', 'films', 'basically', 'get', 'here', 'origins', 'Puss', 'character', 'early', 'adventure', 'general', 'fun', 'atmosphere', 'Shrek', 'movies', 'having', 'own', 'identity', 'full', 'lots', 'humor', 'good', 'adventure', 'story', 'keep', 'plot', 'are', 'several', 'things', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'totally', 'blown', 'got', 'spot-on', 'right', 'creators', 'made', 'right', 'move', 'focusing', 'one', 'character', 'Shrek', 'movies', 'own', 'feature', 'definitely', 'made', 'right', 'choice', 'characters', 'Puss', 'likeable', 'amusing', 'enough', 'substance', 'pull', 'lead', 'role', 'music', 'lover', 'was', 'particularly', 'pleased', 'flamenco-ish', 'soundtrack', 'featuring', 'Rodrigo', 'Gabriela', 'added', 'overal', 'cultural', 'flavor', 'opposed', 'modern', 'pop', 'music', 'Shrek', 'Similarly', 'Zorro', 'similarities', 'title', 'character', 'was', 'matched', 'Mexican', 'setting', 'appropriate', 'accents', 'annoying', 'American', 'accent', 'Humpty', 'Dumpty', 'fit', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'explanation', 'movie', 'why', 'someone', 'raised', 'small', 'child', 'orphanage', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'accent', 'grew', 'up', 'around', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'fit', 'innapropriate', 'references', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'belong', 'example', 'Muppet', 'Babies', 'where', 'bunch', 'characters', ""'d"", 'seen', 'meet', 'first', 'time', 'adults', 'are', 'now', 'seen', 'hanging', 'out', 'children', 'So', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'Shrek', 'Donkey', 'Puss', 'just', 'fine', 'own', 'movie', 'maybe', 'little', 'better', 'increasingly', 'over-the-top', 'slapstick', 'later', 'Shrek', 'films', 'fact', 'movie', 'definitely', 'different', 'feel', 'Shrek', 'little', 'less', 'focus', 'mixing', 'modern', 'pop-culture', 'references', 'fantasy', 'setting', 'elements', 'are', 'still', 'there.Definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'hope', 'series', 'films', 'own']",Puss in Boots

So knowing that this is a side story to that, I can't really comment on if it ties in with the series at all.  This is supposedly more of a life before Shrek for Puss in Boots and the adventures that he had.Puss as a cute young kitten is adopted by a kindly mother in charge of an orphanage.  There he meets Humpty Dumpty, although they later have a falling out in which Puss loses his honor.  But fate has something different in store for him, and when he reunites with Humpty later (and a pretty female feline named Kitty) they go on an adventure that will get the golden goose that lays the golden eggs from the top of the beanstalk.  But there are several people out to stop them, including the infamous duo of Jack and Jill.  Humpty says it will restore Puss's honor though, so he will do all it takes to get the golden goose.Characters:Antonio Banderas: Puss in BootsSalma Hayek: Kitty SoftpawsZach Galifianakis: Humpty DumptyBilly Bob Thornton & Amy Sedaris: Jack and JillWalt Dohrn: NarratorI have to say, I thought Antonio did a great job as Puss.  The accent was very charming on him and even the little hisses and mews made were very cute.  Salma as Kitty was also a nice character although I wish she would have been more in the forefront rather than a sidekick.  Humpty Dumpty, he just freaked me out to be quite honest.  He was kind of creepy looking and a bit smarmy.  But Galifianakis did a good job on the voicing and it fit the character very well.  All the other characters were ok.  I did like Jack and Jill and the banter they had going on between them.  I think they were probably the funniest out of all of them.For a plot, I actually found a lot of this movie slow going and kind of boring.  Puss would go into a story and I could feel my eyes glaze over since he took so long to tell it.  There was a lot of humour shot in though and I could find myself giggling quite a bit.  Although parents should be warned that some of the jokes are kind of adult in theme.  Luckily as well the ending picked up a bit and made the movie better.  I think the main draw of this movie is probably the animation.  Lots of colors and layers, I didn't see it in 3D but all the same it was still very easy to watch and exciting visually.  The music was also very well fit to the movie.  I liked the different beats that they used and how it was good dancing music.Not the best movie out of the Shrek series but it had a certain charm.  This is a movie good for all ages.Review by M.

1416552,AHF97M45JFCB,B004LWZW7Y,ONENEO,"[0, 1]","Given the success of the Puss character from the second Shrek film onward, one would get the feeling it would take a lot to screw up the origin story.  However, looking at the film as a whole, it certainly falls short of the expectations of the franchise on which it's based.  This isn't to suggest it's a total failure of course, so much as it seems the producers of this piece were oddly out of touch with what made the character (and the Shrek series in general) so endearing.Coming in at runtime of 90-minutes and wearing an appropriate PG rating, 2011's Puss In Boots set DreamWorks back $130-million.  Believe it or not, the film was originally intended to be a direct-to-dvd affair before DreamWorks decided the character may have enough clout to potentially fill theaters.The tale naturally revolves around Puss, and sets up the vain, confident, swashbuckler (voiced by Antonio Banderas) as a kitten with delusions of grandeur, made more achievable by an unlikely partnership with one Humpty Alexander Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis).  Before long the pair is on a quest to find the Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs, in hot pursuit by a murderous, drunkard Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris), and teaming up with the feisty and seductive Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek).The majority of the film takes place in Spain and the surrounding deserts and while its visuals are undeniably DreamWorks, the film certainly lacks the vivid color pallet of the Shreks and instead relies upon a lot of moonlit and fire-lit scenes.  Despite moody tones and a fairly convoluted plot-line, the characters themselves are animated wonderfully with the titular character hilariously alternating between pint-sized swashbuckler and run-of-the-mill feline with regularity.The film is laced with a lot of salsa-flavored tunes and beats and there are a number of requisite dance sequences to accompany the rhythmic tunes.  The pacing, however, isn't quite as butter-smooth as one would expect from a big budget Hollywood animated film.  Some of said dance numbers run on a bit too long and flashbacks to Puss' roots disrupt the natural flow of the present (which, if you want to be technical is still the past in the mythos).In all Puss In Boots is a fun film from the director of Shrek The Third though a strong argument could be made that this isn't DreamWorks' biggest or best animated feature.  I'm of the opinion that the fairy tale integration isn't near as subliminal or well-placed as we've witnessed in the Shrek films and the uneven pacing makes it easy for very young viewers to become bored with the story.  However, the nuances of the characters themselves mixed with some moments of clever dialog do make it interesting enough for adults to sit through.  In all, it's a very good formula for a rental.",3,Passable But Pales When Compared to the Shrek Series That Inspired It,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,2806,"['Given', 'success', 'Puss', 'character', 'second', 'Shrek', 'film', 'onward', 'one', 'would', 'get', 'feeling', 'would', 'take', 'lot', 'screw', 'up', 'origin', 'story', 'However', 'looking', 'film', 'whole', 'certainly', 'short', 'expectations', 'franchise', 'based', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'total', 'failure', 'course', 'so', 'much', 'producers', 'piece', 'were', 'oddly', 'touch', 'what', 'made', 'character', 'Shrek', 'series', 'general', 'so', 'endearing.Coming', 'runtime', '90-minutes', 'wearing', 'appropriate', 'PG', 'rating', '2011', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'set', 'DreamWorks', 'back', '130-million', 'Believe', 'not', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'be', 'direct-to-dvd', 'affair', 'DreamWorks', 'decided', 'character', 'may', 'have', 'enough', 'clout', 'potentially', 'fill', 'theaters.The', 'tale', 'naturally', 'Puss', 'up', 'vain', 'confident', 'swashbuckler', 'voiced', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'kitten', 'delusions', 'grandeur', 'made', 'more', 'achievable', 'unlikely', 'partnership', 'one', 'Humpty', 'Alexander', 'Dumpty', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'long', 'pair', 'quest', 'find', 'Goose', 'Laid', 'Golden', 'Eggs', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'murderous', 'drunkard', 'Jack', 'Jill', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'teaming', 'up', 'feisty', 'seductive', 'Kitty', 'Softpaws', 'Salma', 'Hayek', '.The', 'majority', 'film', 'place', 'Spain', 'surrounding', 'deserts', 'visuals', 'are', 'undeniably', 'DreamWorks', 'film', 'certainly', 'vivid', 'color', 'pallet', 'Shreks', 'instead', 'relies', 'lot', 'moonlit', 'fire-lit', 'scenes', 'moody', 'tones', 'fairly', 'convoluted', 'plot-line', 'characters', 'are', 'animated', 'wonderfully', 'titular', 'character', 'hilariously', 'alternating', 'pint-sized', 'swashbuckler', 'run-of-the-mill', 'feline', 'regularity.The', 'film', 'laced', 'lot', 'salsa-flavored', 'tunes', 'beats', 'are', 'number', 'requisite', 'dance', 'sequences', 'accompany', 'rhythmic', 'tunes', 'pacing', 'however', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'butter-smooth', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'big', 'budget', 'Hollywood', 'animated', 'film', 'said', 'dance', 'numbers', 'run', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'flashbacks', 'Puss', 'roots', 'disrupt', 'natural', 'flow', 'present', 'want', 'be', 'technical', 'still', 'past', 'mythos', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'fun', 'film', 'director', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'strong', 'argument', 'could', 'be', 'made', ""n't"", 'DreamWorks', 'biggest', 'best', 'animated', 'feature', ""'m"", 'opinion', 'fairy', 'tale', 'integration', ""n't"", 'near', 'subliminal', 'well-placed', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'Shrek', 'films', 'uneven', 'pacing', 'easy', 'very', 'young', 'viewers', 'become', 'bored', 'story', 'However', 'nuances', 'characters', 'mixed', 'moments', 'clever', 'dialog', 'do', 'make', 'interesting', 'enough', 'adults', 'sit', 'very', 'good', 'formula', 'rental']",Puss in Boots

1416562,A3UT7I4QCP1FQR,B004LWZW7Y,"Rajesh Motie ""Xanatos Planned This Signature""","[4, 5]","After the dismal Shrek the Third and the better but not-so-good Shrek Forever After, the box office returns for the franchise were at a series low and needed new blood. In being a prequel, Puss in Boots was walking a fine line. It could have been an origin story, at the risk of going through the motions, or it could have had nothing to do with the history of the character, at the risk of feeling pointless. Fortunately, this movie manages to strike the right balance and breathes new life into Dreamwork's Shrek world.When Puss (Antonio Banderas) finds out that outlaws Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris) have magic beans that can take them to the giant's castle, he ends up reuniting with Humpty Alexander Dumpy (Zach Galifianakis) and meeting Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), and together they set out to stop the villains.The best thing about Puss in Boots is its three leads. Banderas, Galifianakis and Hayek are a fun trio, especially because of the cats and egg's shared history. We learn the story of Puss and Humpty's childhood, and how Puss became the swashbuckling cat he is. Their origin is the driving force for them throughout the movie. It really takes me back to the first two Shrek movies.Puss in Boots reminded me of how much I enjoyed Shrek 1 and 2, and in that I can can't help but compare it to them. This movie is funny as well as heartfelt, but not as much as the Shreks. There are certainly less memorable moments. The plot it also quite predictable, a family movie story that you can guess from the beginning.The first part of the movie fleshes out the three main characters, gets them to work as a team, and the final act builds on what we've learned. But the middle, the actual beanstalk adventure, feels underwhelming and short. Sure, the accelerated growth of the beanstalk, with the characters hurtling up toward the sky, was cool. But more could have been done with the castle, and the journey through it is disappointing. Also...Humpty spent a lot of time dressed in a useless golden suit. It was weird.Jack and Jill are also distractingly lackluster; they have about one villainous scene before their conversations are all about raising children. It's funny at first, but consumes the characters, and they never really do a whole lot. I wouldn't even be mentioning this if they weren't the main villains.Puss has proven that he can lead his own movie, and his two companions prove to be entertaining foils. The movie misses a few beats, for sure, but it's also really fun and made me like the Shrek universe once more. Definitely a hit for Dreamworks.8 out of 10",4,Puss can hold his own.,1321574400,"11 18, 2011",2011,2610,"['dismal', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'better', 'not-so-good', 'Shrek', 'Forever', 'box', 'office', 'returns', 'franchise', 'were', 'series', 'low', 'needed', 'new', 'blood', 'being', 'prequel', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'was', 'walking', 'fine', 'line', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'origin', 'story', 'risk', 'going', 'motions', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'history', 'character', 'risk', 'feeling', 'pointless', 'Fortunately', 'movie', 'strike', 'right', 'balance', 'new', 'life', 'Dreamwork', 'Shrek', 'world.When', 'Puss', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'out', 'outlaws', 'Jack', 'Jill', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'have', 'magic', 'beans', 'can', 'take', 'giant', 'castle', 'up', 'reuniting', 'Humpty', 'Alexander', 'Dumpy', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'meeting', 'Kitty', 'Softpaws', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'together', 'set', 'out', 'stop', 'villains.The', 'best', 'thing', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'three', 'leads', 'Banderas', 'Galifianakis', 'Hayek', 'are', 'fun', 'trio', 'especially', 'cats', 'egg', 'shared', 'history', 'learn', 'story', 'Puss', 'Humpty', 'childhood', 'how', 'Puss', 'became', 'swashbuckling', 'cat', 'origin', 'driving', 'force', 'movie', 'really', 'back', 'first', 'two', 'Shrek', 'movies.Puss', 'Boots', 'reminded', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'Shrek', '1', '2', 'can', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'compare', 'movie', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'heartfelt', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'Shreks', 'are', 'certainly', 'less', 'memorable', 'moments', 'plot', 'also', 'quite', 'predictable', 'family', 'movie', 'story', 'can', 'guess', 'beginning.The', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'out', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'work', 'team', 'final', 'act', 'builds', 'what', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'middle', 'actual', 'beanstalk', 'adventure', 'feels', 'underwhelming', 'short', 'Sure', 'accelerated', 'growth', 'beanstalk', 'characters', 'hurtling', 'up', 'sky', 'was', 'cool', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'castle', 'journey', 'disappointing', 'Also', 'Humpty', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'dressed', 'useless', 'golden', 'suit', 'was', 'weird.Jack', 'Jill', 'are', 'also', 'distractingly', 'lackluster', 'have', 'one', 'villainous', 'scene', 'conversations', 'are', 'raising', 'children', 'funny', 'first', 'characters', 'never', 'really', 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'mentioning', 'were', ""n't"", 'main', 'villains.Puss', 'proven', 'can', 'lead', 'own', 'movie', 'two', 'companions', 'prove', 'be', 'entertaining', 'foils', 'movie', 'few', 'beats', 'sure', 'also', 'really', 'fun', 'made', 'Shrek', 'universe', 'once', 'more', 'Definitely', 'hit', 'Dreamworks.8', '10']",Puss in Boots

You will have to watch this wonderful animated movie to find out how can such cute little creature turn out to be such a bad little kitty....I absolutely adore this movie.  It is great for both adults and kids.  One does not have to be a cat lover to fall in love with this kitty cat character so adorably played by Antonio Banderas.  In the story, Puss meets his match.  Her name is Kitty Puff and she is a female Zoro (played by Salma Hayek).  This animated film is very original.  It has wonderful moments such as Puss in the bar when he orders a shot of ""leche"". The way he drinks it will drive you mad!  Not to mention dancing duel between Puss and Kitty when she pulls a ""kitty litter"" dance move on him. I loved this film from start to finish.

The plot of the movie centers around Puss and Humpty searching for magic beans.  These magic beans grow into a bean stalk that leads to a giant's castle.  Inside the castle is a goose that lays golden eggs.  Nursery rhyme characters Jack and Jill are the villains in the film. Only the movie makers of Dream Works can breathe life and personality into these two characters.  I love the creative license of the animators.  There are two things about the movie that make it special.  The animation and music are excellent. My favorite scene has Puss sword  fighting and dancing with a female cat named Kitty Soft Paws.  She is voiced by Selma Hayek.  This scene in the movie is very funny.  I love the simple scenes of the movie.  One scene has Puss riding a horse in the back drop of a setting sun.  The film is scored by composer Henry Jackman.  His music gives the movie a sensual latin flair. There is a track of music in the film entitled ""The Puss Suite"".  This piece of music sounds so uplifting and heroic.  Rodrigo Y Gabriela are two latin guitar musicians.  They perform a track entitled ""Diablo Rojo"" in the film.  This instrumental  is upbeat and beautiful to listen to. Puss In Boots is a very entertaining animated film.

It has a good cast and is very amusing at times.  The animation was very well done which one might expect from Dreamworks.  It was different than I expected from what I saw in the trailer and maybe that is why I was satisfied with it.  The story is very simple although there is some adult humor mixed in but all in fun.  It is almost like an animated version of Zorro except puss in boots is not a vigilante but a falsely accused fugitive.  The cat humor was my favorite!

Not even a dog person, I only like huge dogs (German Shepherds, Labs, Collies, etc.) that cats hate. But Puss in Boots is quite possibly the cutest cat ever (in film) and temporarily made me think, ""Maybe I should give cats a chance."" Not only is the cat cute; this film is adorable.Initially I wondered whether I'd actually go see the film considering I liked Shrek but wasn't sure if Puss in Boots could pull off a film all by himself. However, I saw a behind-the-scenes interview with RedEye featuring Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek talking about the film. I'm a HUGE Antonio Banderas fan so I like to see/hear him in anything. (He's almost as hot as Puss in Boots. Well, maybe it's a tie.) The more they talked about the film and the more reviews I read, the more I decided to give the film a try.The summary: Puss in Boots meets up with his friend-turned-rival Humpty Dumpty and they plot out how to get magic beans. Humpty Dumpty is obsessed with these beans so much that he's been stealing them forever and gotten Puss in Boots in a lot of trouble. But with a little persuading from a very sexy, charismatic Kitty Soft Paws and remembering how great his brotherhood used to be with Humpty Dumpty, Puss in Boots gives in.There are a few cute dance performances, some music that would make steppers jealous, plenty of memorable one-liners, consistent funny parts and a whole lot of G-rated sexiness that adults and kids can love alike. I highly recommend this film. The cast and the creators did a superb job. I left the movie theater dancing around like Puss in Boots, beating on tables trying to re-create the beats and embarrassing the person I was with but I don't care. I'm all about Puss in Boots!P.S.

The sheer genius of the people who put this story together is deserving of all the accolades that could be bestowed upon them. The story was utterly impeccable and the combination of the the old fairy tales, the Shrek films, and most importantly the behaviors of all our beloved pet cats are interwoven seamlessly into this story. I couldn't believe all the ways that they found to make this movie so memorably funny and endearing to the audience (and especially us cat lovers) that it was a really fun movie to see.Now if you are familiar with your childhood fairy-tales, the basic premise of the movie is that Puss (in Boots) along with Humpty Alexander Dumpty, and Ms. Kitty South-Paws start an adventurous trek to obtain some magic beans in order to provide access to the goose that lays the golden eggs. And yes, there just may be a beanstalk involved.I really can't tell you any details about this movie without risking spoiling a scene or two, but I will let you know that Humpty Alexander Dumpty, voiced byThe Hangoverstar Zach Galifianakis, is a pivotal character in this movie along with Jack and Jill. Although I think you may find yourself quite surprised by the movie version of these two compared to their pail of water exploits from the fairy tales. Another new character is Ms. Kitty Soft-Paws voiced by the beautiful Salma Hayek, who by the way does an outstanding job as Puss' love interest/nemesis.Now I am not going to post any spoilers, but I will tell you that I found one particular scene so funny that it is my most cherished moment in the movie and it involves a shot-glass full of milk in the first bar scene. And that is all I am going to say about that, but be sure and look for it. Perhaps you will even think it was as funny as I did.This is a totally awesome movie for kids of all ages, including us bigger kids.

Antonio Banderas brilliantly plays the role of the cat ""Puss In Boots"" who is back to engage in a journey to reclaim his honor.  Salma Hayek also does a clever performance as ""Kitty Softpaws"". Kitty Softpaws  ends up accompanying Puss in Boots in his quest to restore his reputation, and capture magic beans.  Zach Galifianakis (from the Hangover movie) plays the role of Humpty Dumpty. Humpty Dumpty is a past friend of Puss in Boots and greatly shapes his character evolution through subtle psychological tests.  Billy Bob Thornton (of the Bad Santa movie) and Amy Sedaris play the ""outlaws"" Jack and Jill.  Jack and Jill have the magic beans that Puss in Boots wants to covet.  My only caveat with this film is that Jack and Jill were intentionally made to be overweight, plain-looking, and evil.  This reinforces the stereotype that only attractive people are capable of humanity and compassion.  It is common knowledge that there are beautiful people that are both cold and calculating. I would have liked to see villain characters that reflected ""wolf in sheep's clothing"" rather than the usual generic stereotype of only plain people being abrasive.

Humpty convinces Puss to sign on to the idea, and the two go after the Golden Goose.This is your typical Dreamworks film.  The cinematography is stunning, the landscapes never better.

I don't know, though I really enjoyed watching the film. Anyway, directed by Chris Miller (""Shrek the Third""), the light-hearted adventure movie succeeds by not taking itself too seriously, just like the titular sword-wielding cat sporting a plumed hat.The new DreamWorks animation follows the story of Puss in Boots (voice by Antonio Banderas) before meeting Shrek and his friends. After his plan to steal magic beans from Jack and Jill is sabotaged by a mysterious thief, the outlaw cat encounters his childhood friend Humpty Dumpty (voice by Zach Galifianakis). The storyline, inspired by such famous fables, folklores and fairy tales as ""The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs"" and ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" is predictable but good enough for rollicking adventures including the joyful ""dance fight"" sequence.The screenwriter team wisely avoided pop culture references that would be tiresome in this new chapter. A new female character Kitty Softpaws, a master pickpocket (voice by Banderas's ""Desperado"" co-star Salma Hayek) appears, but the ""Puss in Boots"" is light on romance and heavy on action set-pieces. Those who prefer the quirky touch of ""Rango"" will find the characters and storytelling too conventional, but ""Puss in Boots"" remains enjoyable nonetheless.As far as story and visuals go, ""Puss in Boots"" breaks no new ground, with familiar storyline and action sequences, but it still manages to be entertaining throughout.",4,Entertaining Romp,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,1545,"['spin-off', 'Shrek', 'series', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'romp', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'film', 'Anyway', 'directed', 'Chris', 'Miller', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'light-hearted', 'adventure', 'movie', 'not', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'just', 'titular', 'sword-wielding', 'cat', 'sporting', 'plumed', 'hat.The', 'new', 'DreamWorks', 'animation', 'story', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'voice', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'meeting', 'Shrek', 'friends', 'plan', 'steal', 'magic', 'beans', 'Jack', 'Jill', 'sabotaged', 'mysterious', 'thief', 'outlaw', 'cat', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Humpty', 'Dumpty', 'voice', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'storyline', 'inspired', 'such', 'famous', 'fables', 'folklores', 'fairy', 'tales', 'Goose', 'Laid', 'Golden', 'Eggs', 'Jack', 'Beanstalk', 'predictable', 'good', 'enough', 'rollicking', 'adventures', 'including', 'joyful', 'dance', 'fight', 'sequence.The', 'screenwriter', 'team', 'wisely', 'avoided', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'would', 'be', 'tiresome', 'new', 'chapter', 'new', 'female', 'character', 'Kitty', 'Softpaws', 'master', 'pickpocket', 'voice', 'Banderas', 'Desperado', 'co-star', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'light', 'romance', 'heavy', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'who', 'prefer', 'quirky', 'touch', 'Rango', 'will', 'find', 'characters', 'storytelling', 'too', 'conventional', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'enjoyable', 'nonetheless.As', 'far', 'story', 'visuals', 'go', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'new', 'ground', 'familiar', 'storyline', 'action', 'sequences', 'still', 'be', 'entertaining']",Puss in Boots

I was so horrendously disappointed, I can't believe the people who left these 4 & 5 star reviews were awake for this film. Puss starts life out @ a boarding school where humpty dumpty is his best friend. He then grows up going on a quest for the magic beans from the Jack & the Beanstalk story. It gets even weirder when a very neanderthalish (billy bob thorton) starts after him after he steals the magic beans. It is the biggest mess of an animated feature imaginable. Makes you wonder, what the writers/directors were on. couldn't be good pot, it would have been a much better story.
