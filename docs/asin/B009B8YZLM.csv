The supporting cast sees stiff too.  The timing is off, and the quick witted play is missing.

Arthur,"[8, 8]","This is a lame attempt to recreate the Peter Sellers role of Clouseau in a different setting, the British office that protects the Queen of England.  The main character trips, blunders, slips, falls over, and generally makes an ass of himself.  What a shame that David Jason, now in his 70s, had to descend to the level of a boob to keep working.  The worst part: the series isn't funny.  Indeed, it's embarrassing.  Skip this and revisit the Pink Panther movies.  It's a world of difference.",2,Clouseau revisited,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,492,"['lame', 'attempt', 'recreate', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'role', 'Clouseau', 'different', 'setting', 'British', 'office', 'Queen', 'England', 'main', 'character', 'trips', 'blunders', 'slips', 'generally', 'ass', 'What', 'shame', 'David', 'Jason', 'now', '70s', 'had', 'descend', 'level', 'boob', 'keep', 'working', 'worst', 'part', 'series', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Indeed', 'embarrassing', 'Skip', 'revisit', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'movies', 'world', 'difference']",Royal Bodyguard

The show is joy to watch from beginning to end. He's come a long way since Open all Hours, another great British comedy.Don't let the naysayers ruin it for you.
