1147611,A18Z33BM3GZE9R,B0014Z4OKW,"Carl Cannella ""alec_of_kerry419""","[6, 7]","The Air I Breathe is a deeply sad, richly plotted drama centered around an Ancient Chinese proverb that all life is divided into four basic emotions; Happiness, Pleasure, Sorrow, and Love. The film is divided into four short films, each centered on one of those four emotions, that all intersect and shape the fate of each other's main character. First-time writer/director Jeiho Lee isn't entirely successful, however, as this fiercely ambitious drama is wrought with powerful performances but little else. It is entirely unclear what this film is trying to say.One can assume that Lee was attempting a parable on how we all try to fill our lives with these emotions.... or maybe that none of these emotions are attainable? It's a truly baffling screenplay. The dialogue is clunky, the characters underdeveloped and unsure of their direction, and yet the exceptionally powerful performances ground the film in ways it almost doesn't deserve. The frenetic editing serves neither to enhance the story nor to add suspense to the proceedings. This ambitious little drama would have been much better served with an experienced director with a knack for subtlety, something sorely lacking in this pieces.But those performances! With a cast of Oscar winners and nominees, we are treated to nothing but the best these actors have to offer. Andy Garcia chews the scenery as gangster Fingers, who is one of the few characters with relevance to each of the film's subplots, but his over-the-top antics shows him a much more dept actor than he has been credit for over the years; he knows this script is silly. Brendan Fraser sulks as the moral center of the story, Emile Hirsch babbles as Fingers' vulgar nephew, Forest Whitaker whimpers as a sniveling banker, and Sarah Michelle Gellar unexpectedly shines above the rest in an award-worthy, career high performances as a rising pop star. Gellar truly excels at the role, and embellishes it with an understated grace and innocence. What is ironic is that it is she who most needed this film to be a success, and it is she who will be most affected by the film's failure to receive a theatrical release. It's a shame, too - this could have been the film that cemented her status in Hollywood as more than just the star of Buffy.Despite these unusually strong performances, the movie never fully gels; The crime isn't criminal enough, the violence isn't violent enough, and the drama isn't dramatic enough. What would have greatly benefited the piece is a longer running time, which would have allowed the characters to blossom as more than just caricatures. The actors try to make these people feel real, but we simply don't see enough of any of them to truly understand what makes them tick. Nor do we see enough interaction among them to see why their connections with each other is relevant. Again, this all falls to the inexperience of director Jeiho Lee. He has crafted an entertaining crime drama, and proven to the world that Sarah Michelle Gellar deserves better than teen horror films, but he fall just short of his attempts at reflection on the human spirit.",4,Alright Movie with Remarkable Cast,1211932800,"05 28, 2008",2008,3107,"['Air', 'Breathe', 'deeply', 'sad', 'richly', 'plotted', 'drama', 'centered', 'Ancient', 'Chinese', 'proverb', 'life', 'divided', 'four', 'basic', 'emotions', 'Happiness', 'Pleasure', 'Sorrow', 'Love', 'film', 'divided', 'four', 'short', 'films', 'centered', 'one', 'four', 'emotions', 'intersect', 'shape', 'fate', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'First-time', 'writer/director', 'Jeiho', 'Lee', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'successful', 'however', 'fiercely', 'ambitious', 'drama', 'wrought', 'powerful', 'performances', 'little', 'else', 'entirely', 'unclear', 'what', 'film', 'trying', 'say.One', 'can', 'assume', 'Lee', 'was', 'attempting', 'parable', 'how', 'try', 'fill', 'lives', 'emotions', 'maybe', 'none', 'emotions', 'are', 'attainable', 'truly', 'baffling', 'screenplay', 'dialogue', 'clunky', 'characters', 'underdeveloped', 'unsure', 'direction', 'yet', 'exceptionally', 'powerful', 'performances', 'ground', 'film', 'ways', 'almost', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'frenetic', 'editing', 'enhance', 'story', 'add', 'suspense', 'proceedings', 'ambitious', 'little', 'drama', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'served', 'experienced', 'director', 'knack', 'subtlety', 'something', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'pieces.But', 'performances', 'cast', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'nominees', 'are', 'treated', 'nothing', 'best', 'actors', 'have', 'offer', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'scenery', 'gangster', 'Fingers', 'who', 'one', 'few', 'characters', 'relevance', 'film', 'subplots', 'over-the-top', 'antics', 'much', 'more', 'dept', 'actor', 'been', 'credit', 'years', 'script', 'silly', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'sulks', 'moral', 'center', 'story', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Fingers', 'vulgar', 'nephew', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'whimpers', 'sniveling', 'banker', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'unexpectedly', 'rest', 'award-worthy', 'career', 'high', 'performances', 'rising', 'pop', 'star', 'Gellar', 'truly', 'role', 'understated', 'grace', 'innocence', 'What', 'ironic', 'who', 'most', 'needed', 'film', 'be', 'success', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'affected', 'film', 'failure', 'receive', 'theatrical', 'release', 'shame', 'too', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'cemented', 'status', 'Hollywood', 'more', 'just', 'star', 'Buffy.Despite', 'unusually', 'strong', 'performances', 'movie', 'never', 'fully', 'gels', 'crime', ""n't"", 'criminal', 'enough', 'violence', ""n't"", 'violent', 'enough', 'drama', ""n't"", 'dramatic', 'enough', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'greatly', 'benefited', 'piece', 'longer', 'running', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'characters', 'blossom', 'more', 'just', 'caricatures', 'actors', 'try', 'make', 'people', 'feel', 'real', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'enough', 'truly', 'understand', 'what', 'tick', 'do', 'see', 'enough', 'interaction', 'see', 'why', 'connections', 'other', 'relevant', 'Again', 'inexperience', 'director', 'Jeiho', 'Lee', 'crafted', 'entertaining', 'crime', 'drama', 'proven', 'world', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'better', 'teen', 'horror', 'films', 'fall', 'just', 'short', 'attempts', 'reflection', 'human', 'spirit']",N/A

1147613,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0014Z4OKW,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 10]","Put simply, this ponderous and uneasy melding of noirish crime melodrama and nihilistic character study is for the audience who really loved the allegorical minefield that wasCrash. This 2008 movie actually makes the interconnecting contrivances of the 2005 omnibus film seem all the more plausible with an overstuffed storyline that hinges on an ancient Chinese proverb that breaks life down into four emotional cornerstones - happiness, pleasure, sorrow, and love. The irony of the filmic treatment by Korean-American director/co-writer Jieho Lee is that he takes the proverb literally by having the four principal actors represent the emotions individually. Cheekily, Lee gives none of their characters real names (though one has a stage name) and then has them intersect to show how the emotions co-exist and make up the whole of the human experience. The problem is that Lee is so caught up in his concept that the resulting screenplay (co-written with Bob DeRosa) feels like it's in a constant spin cycle of increasingly preposterous situations, all for the sake of illustrating how their paths are inextricably linked to each other.Lacking the confident finesse of obvious role model Robert Altman (thinkNashvilleorShort Cutsas comparative works), Lee goes so far as subdividing the movie into four discrete chapters. In ""Happiness"", Forest Whitaker (his follow-up toThe Last King of Scotland) plays a self-defeated money manager who bets his life savings on a fixed horse race only to find himself indebted to a vicious Mob boss named Fingers (seriously). An unusually glum-faced Brendan Fraser is ""Pleasure"" playing a clairvoyant (again seriously), tough-acting money collector charged with babysitting Fingers' obnoxious nephew Tony. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays ""Sorrow"", a Lindsay Lohan-type, alcohol-fueled pop star known to her fans as Trista, a name derived from the Latin word for ""sad"". Her contract is sold by her desperately smarmy manager to - you guessed it - Fingers. The final chapter has Kevin Bacon playing ""Love"" as a doctor who still holds a torch for Gina, a herpetologist married to his shallow best friend, a plastic surgeon naturally. A predictable, race-against-the-clock tragedy then occurs. There is no point in discussing the common points of intersection other than to say that Lee's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach does not hold up remotely to the light of credibility when you look, for example, at the convolutions that a character like ""Sorrow"" goes through. Your eyebrows will be severely exercised by the last ten minutes.The cast is all over the map here, but the four principal actors - Whitaker, Bacon, Fraser and a surprisingly sturdy Gellar - are all relatively effective. In particular, Fraser's clamped-down turn shows a heretofore hidden talent for Guy Ritchie-type movies. It would have also been nice to see some evidence of Gellar's pop-star appeal other than her character's tabloid-friendly behavior. As Fingers, Andy Garcia seems to be playing the same despicable role he has been playing inOcean's Elevenand any number of mob-related movies. Emile Hirsch (Into the Wild) is appropriately irritating as Tony, while Julie Delpy (Two Days in Paris) is given little to do as Gina except look faintly forlorn. Ultimately, it really comes down to the actors in terms of making this a salvageable film-watching experience. It certainly isn't Lee's overly familiar, Tarantino-style filmmaking techniques (...in fact, I think there are more car crashes and near-crashes here than in ""Crash""). The 2008 DVD features a robust commentary track from Lee, DeRosa, cinematographer Walt Lloyd and editor Robert Hoffman - worth a listen if only to understand the good intentions behind the production. Four minutes of deleted scenes, understandably excised, and two minutes of outtakes, none of it amusing, are also included.",2,"""Crash""-Derived Parable Layers the Contrivances Pretty Thick Despite a Committed Cast",1215734400,"07 11, 2008",2008,3873,"['Put', 'simply', 'ponderous', 'uneasy', 'melding', 'noirish', 'crime', 'melodrama', 'nihilistic', 'character', 'study', 'audience', 'who', 'really', 'loved', 'allegorical', 'minefield', 'wasCrash', '2008', 'movie', 'actually', 'interconnecting', 'contrivances', '2005', 'omnibus', 'film', 'seem', 'more', 'plausible', 'overstuffed', 'storyline', 'ancient', 'Chinese', 'proverb', 'life', 'down', 'four', 'emotional', 'cornerstones', 'happiness', 'pleasure', 'sorrow', 'love', 'irony', 'filmic', 'treatment', 'Korean-American', 'director/co-writer', 'Jieho', 'Lee', 'proverb', 'literally', 'having', 'four', 'principal', 'actors', 'represent', 'emotions', 'individually', 'Cheekily', 'Lee', 'none', 'characters', 'real', 'names', 'one', 'stage', 'name', 'then', 'intersect', 'show', 'how', 'emotions', 'co-exist', 'make', 'up', 'whole', 'human', 'experience', 'problem', 'Lee', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'concept', 'resulting', 'screenplay', 'co-written', 'Bob', 'DeRosa', 'feels', 'constant', 'spin', 'cycle', 'increasingly', 'preposterous', 'situations', 'sake', 'illustrating', 'how', 'paths', 'are', 'inextricably', 'linked', 'other.Lacking', 'confident', 'finesse', 'obvious', 'role', 'model', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'thinkNashvilleorShort', 'Cutsas', 'comparative', 'works', 'Lee', 'so', 'far', 'subdividing', 'movie', 'four', 'discrete', 'chapters', 'Happiness', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'follow-up', 'toThe', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'self-defeated', 'money', 'manager', 'who', 'life', 'savings', 'fixed', 'horse', 'race', 'only', 'find', 'indebted', 'vicious', 'Mob', 'boss', 'named', 'Fingers', 'seriously', 'unusually', 'glum-faced', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Pleasure', 'playing', 'clairvoyant', 'again', 'seriously', 'tough-acting', 'money', 'collector', 'charged', 'babysitting', 'Fingers', 'obnoxious', 'nephew', 'Tony', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Sorrow', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan-type', 'alcohol-fueled', 'pop', 'star', 'known', 'fans', 'Trista', 'name', 'derived', 'Latin', 'word', 'sad', 'contract', 'sold', 'desperately', 'smarmy', 'manager', 'guessed', 'Fingers', 'final', 'chapter', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'playing', 'Love', 'doctor', 'who', 'still', 'torch', 'Gina', 'herpetologist', 'married', 'shallow', 'best', 'friend', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'naturally', 'predictable', 'race-against-the-clock', 'tragedy', 'then', 'point', 'discussing', 'common', 'points', 'intersection', 'other', 'say', 'Lee', 'everything-but-the-kitchen-sink', 'approach', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'remotely', 'light', 'credibility', 'when', 'look', 'example', 'convolutions', 'character', 'Sorrow', 'eyebrows', 'will', 'be', 'severely', 'exercised', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes.The', 'cast', 'map', 'here', 'four', 'principal', 'actors', 'Whitaker', 'Bacon', 'Fraser', 'surprisingly', 'sturdy', 'Gellar', 'are', 'relatively', 'effective', 'particular', 'Fraser', 'clamped-down', 'turn', 'heretofore', 'hidden', 'talent', 'Guy', 'Ritchie-type', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'evidence', 'Gellar', 'pop-star', 'appeal', 'other', 'character', 'tabloid-friendly', 'behavior', 'Fingers', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'be', 'playing', 'same', 'despicable', 'role', 'been', 'playing', 'inOcean', 'Elevenand', 'number', 'mob-related', 'movies', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Into', 'Wild', 'appropriately', 'irritating', 'Tony', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'Two', 'Days', 'Paris', 'given', 'little', 'do', 'Gina', 'look', 'faintly', 'forlorn', 'Ultimately', 'really', 'down', 'actors', 'terms', 'making', 'salvageable', 'film-watching', 'experience', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'Lee', 'overly', 'familiar', 'Tarantino-style', 'filmmaking', 'techniques', 'fact', 'think', 'are', 'more', 'car', 'crashes', 'near-crashes', 'here', 'Crash', '2008', 'DVD', 'robust', 'commentary', 'track', 'Lee', 'DeRosa', 'cinematographer', 'Walt', 'Lloyd', 'editor', 'Robert', 'Hoffman', 'worth', 'listen', 'only', 'understand', 'good', 'intentions', 'production', 'Four', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'understandably', 'excised', 'two', 'minutes', 'outtakes', 'none', 'amusing', 'are', 'also', 'included']",N/A
1147614,A19BZXVPQ7WGKW,B0014Z4OKW,"Emanuel Perdis ""A Voracious reader""","[0, 0]","This film fits the ""Crash"" formula, although it's hardly a prizewinner - which is not to say it's awful. The movie takes itself way too seriously, and it doesn't add up to much, but, nevertheless, it's borderline entertaining and philosophically stimulating. The performances have a certain tanginess. Perhaps the stars felt freer than usual because, thanks to the film's episodic structure, none of them had to carry the entire movie.Its layered, interconnected and thought provoking. Definitely allegorical and disturbingly real.The first of four episodes focuses on a mousy, unhappy businessman (Forest Whitaker, convincingly pathetic) who overhears a tip on a horse race. He tries to change his life by taking a loan from mobsters and betting it all on a horse. Along the way, this man encounters a mob henchman (Brendan Fraser, strong and often silent), and we eventually discover that he can see the future. The second section of the film concerns what happens when the mob kingpin (a commanding Andy Garcia) assigns this henchman the task of keeping an eye on his out-of-control nephew (Emile Hirsch, amusingly amok).In part four, an up-and-coming singer (Sarah Michelle Gellar, effectively distraught) abruptly learns that the kingpin has acquired her management contract. She wants nothing to do with him but discovers that his desire to control her career is the kind of offer you can't refuse.The final segment concerns a doctor (a properly pensive Kevin Bacon) who loves a woman (Julie Delpy, appropriately angelic) who suddenly finds herself at death's door. It's up to the doctor to devise a plan to save her - a plan that somehow includes the singer from the previous segment. And to keep the story spinning round and round, it turns out that the singer has a connection to the businessman from the first segment.If this sounds rather contrived, it is. And the various parts of the story don't robviously fit together.The performances give the film a lift. And if the accomplished, eclectic cast was not enough to put The Air I Breathe in contention for a major award, it certainly could help to make you a winner the next time you play Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.",4,"Thought provoking, intriguing, intense.

1147615,A97Q71MM5N4NW,B0014Z4OKW,"Everett ""Future Raptured""","[0, 0]","I had heard of The Air I Breathe but only vaguely as it entered into a very small release in theatres back in 2007. It quickly dropped off the charts and it hadn't been playing anywhere near me thus I was never able to catch a glimpse of the interesting sounding film. Being a fan of interconnecting storylines in the spirit of Amores Perros, Crash, and Babel, my curiosity could only be piqued especially since such films also have the tendency to include all-star casts and unusually good performances and styles. Once the DVD came out I jumped on it.The Air I Breathe follows the story of four different characters in the city as they desperately try to come to terms with their lives -- Happiness, a middle-aged man brought down by his consistency in life who bets everything he has just to escape; Pleasure, a gopher who is able to see the future in bits and pieces but not his own; Sorrow, a popular singer whose life is nearly shattered to pieces when her contract is given to the same underlord ; and Love, a doctor who must find a way to save his best friend whom he is still in love with despite her marriage. The four, under the watchful eye of Fingers, the crime boss who controls them, will come to realize that it's not the way they die but it's the way they live is what they should worry about.The film has some great performances particularly from Forest Whitaker, fresh from his Oscar-winning glory, and Sarah Michelle Gellar. Whitaker, not unfamiliar with being involved with a film of this sort of nature, brings a fresh take to the man who has never experienced a moment of difference in his life and his breath-taking chase through town had you rooting for a character you knew could never possibly escape. Gellar's performance brought about the commonality to the media-frenzied celebrities we hear about everyday while giving her the character she deserved that our socialites lack.I, for one, am not as familiar with Andy Garcia but he played a good villian who is much different in his interactions with several different characters instead of just the mafia. Brendan Frasier gives an okay serious performance but was much too monotone and boring for the role and completely miscast considering he is used to comedy. Other performances given by Kevin Bacon and Julie Delpy do not offer enough screen time or nearly enough depth for us to connect with the characters or even care about them. They are almost tossed into the mix simply to connect the dots without any real concern about who they are.Due to the story being completely character-driven, the afformentioned were what ultimately held down the story. Sometimes the characters had much too development while others had too little and you are given very little time to connect at our an hour and thirty-one minutes. I think I would've appreciated it had it ran on two-hours instead of not enough time. Love's connection to Fingers, like the others, would've been a much appreciated addition but instead he is not and seems like a character who is not even much a character as much as he is simply a supporting personality thrown in to even things out.The look and style of the film, however, is absolutely incredible. For visual beauty each of the four sections never lacks it's own bit of amazing palettes that are only exposed when they need to be.

Infact, maybe the film could have been longer and some people who were terribly miscast like a character called Fingers could have been done differently. There is nothing truly overwhelming about the film. The story is great and the book must be a must read we'll never read.Brendon Fraser. It's been long since I saw him in a film. He did a pretty good job but I'm so used to him being the moral hero that his Terminator'ish performance semmed slightly politely out of place. Andy Garcia should not have been a part of this film. He looks uncomfortable to this cynic from the very first scene. Emile Hirsch, the guy from the excellent *INTO THE WILD* is a part of this film too. He has a small role but he was ok with a very bad haircut.The film didn't lack a message. The film had too many messages and it all seemed a bit rushed.

Crash and Babel are two of my top films and I'm a big supporter of Sarah Michelle Gellar so I was definitely interested in seeing The Air I Breathe.Another initial draw was that the story was based on a Chinese proverb where happiness, sorrow, pleasure, and love all interact with each other for a greater purpose. The interwoven stories and the initial purpose they serve for one character was executed fairly well. The last few frames make the 90-something minute film worth it, but the build up to it just wasn't what I expected. There was something a little flat about the film that I can't really get a hold on.It wasn't the performances. They were all amazing. Forest Whitaker is a gem, and I really enjoyed seeing Kevin Bacon being emotional. Sarah Michelle Gellar has the acting chops, and she gets to showcase just a small amount of what does she have. Brendan Fraser portrayed a very low-key character, and I enjoyed him. I will admit that Andy Garcia and Emile Hirsch irritated me a bit.Visually, the film was on and off. There were certain moments where things could have taken one or two steps up, and the impact the scene was meant to have would have generated something more. I will exclude Forest Whitaker's character's disposition and the final few frames from that for they hit where they were supposed to, as well as Sarah Michelle Gellar's scene on top of the hospital and Kevin Bacon's reaction.I also believe that - for me - the emotional notes the film was supposed to hit didn't hit hard enough because the majority of the characters weren't really fleshed out as much as they should have been.At the end of viewing, The Air I Breathe did not reach the status that I give Crash and Babel. The emotion and character development was just shy of giving me the feeling that I garnered from those two films.

Brendan Fraser who is currently in another ""Mummy"" movie does a decent job as the love-struck hitman.  I don't know why his name is Pleasure other than he gets to be intimate with Sorrow before Pleasure is whacked.  Sarah Michelle Gellar, fresh from her Golden Globe nomination for TV's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" eight years ago, plays Sorrow, a rock star also named Trista.  She's not actually a very good rock star, but she thinks she is.  I wouldn't have bought her CD.  She becomes even more sorrowful when her contract is forced into the hands of con-man Fingers played gruffly by Andy Garcia.  Kevin Bacon who is in ""Frost/Nixon"" plays Love, a doctor who loves a doomed researcher named Gina played by the lovely Julie Delphy.

These characters, respectively played by Forest Whitaker, the disgruntled Wall Street clerk turned bank robber and suicidal sociopath; Brendan Fraser, a reticent hitman who seems to have lost his ability to predict the future as he decides to forsake fealty to his heartless crime lord (Andy Garcia); Kevin Bacon, a doctor who saves the life of Trista, a persecuted pop-star, and is thereby enabled to save from a snake bite his best-friend's wife (Julie Delpy), with whom he also happens to be secretly in love; and Sarah Michelle Gellar's pop tart, Trista, who becomes entangled favourably by the three lives but will lose everything in the while, love, career, and friends.This is the debut feature by Jieho Lee, a Korean-American director and screenwriter who wrote this script as a reflection to his journey in a ""bimodal world"". The cinematography is well suited by the description of bimodal, as the colors are very stark but a terrifying chiaroscuro breathes the presence of a dual tone universe which seems to preface the destiny we all have set out for us, but not independently of others. The acting is mediocre, but for the outstanding consummate performance of Andy Garcia, who seems to be getting better with time and roles, and the flaky, horned-up supercilious nephew of Garcia's role played by Emile Hirsch.The movie bounces along several themes but seems to defragment a somber reality where death and debts seem to frustrate everyone who has a heart, and where life is held hostage by forces that threaten us at all times, from every angle.The congruence of themes is intriguing but the direction fails to fully represent this enigma in ways that portray the meaningful (or lack thereof) essence of life, aside from the role of coincidence. It seems to have no meaning save for being a yarn tangled and reeled compact. Ultimately however the violence seems to be overbearing and inopportune to portray the pain of ordinary lives and extraordinary men, some of which inexplicably have the advantage to foresee the future. This last aspect of the movie is very clearly a deus ex machina, which functions effectively as a means to allegorize destiny, but it does not fit with the pragmatics of the narrative's realist outlook. I fault the writing for that, whereas it was clearly insightful by other turns. There are deaths upon deaths and several cars slamming into people. A practice which I've yet to see done as well as in the Mexican movie Amores Perros, which was also about debts.Herein I think much of the movie fails as well: the restraint it practices in regards to theme of debts, as was the case with the theme of destiny. I enjoyed the movie and it does hold you riveted to the screen thanks to stories that intersect and diverge only to meet into the future of one pop-star who is running away from her past and her present. It could have been better, but it deserves to be viewed.A movie with a lot of questions, too bad it does not know how to ask them...",4,Emotions like waves are constantly in flux...,1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,3407,"['Air', 'Breathe', 'movie', 'entangled', 'lives', 'genre', 'similar', 'Crash', 'respect', 'also', 'way', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'strip', 'clubs', 'gladly', 'not', 'say', 'narrative', 'lacks', 'depth', 'emotional', 'layers', 'viewer', 'acquainted', 'three', 'lives', 'will', 'intertwine', 'so', 'lend', 'freedom', 'fourth', 'four', 'vignettes', 'titled', 'Happiness', 'Pleasure', 'Sorrow', 'Love', 'characters', 'respectively', 'played', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'disgruntled', 'Wall', 'Street', 'clerk', 'turned', 'bank', 'robber', 'suicidal', 'sociopath', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'reticent', 'hitman', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'ability', 'predict', 'future', 'forsake', 'fealty', 'heartless', 'crime', 'lord', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'doctor', 'who', 'life', 'Trista', 'persecuted', 'pop-star', 'thereby', 'enabled', 'save', 'snake', 'bite', 'best-friend', 'wife', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'whom', 'also', 'be', 'secretly', 'love', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'pop', 'tart', 'Trista', 'who', 'entangled', 'favourably', 'three', 'lives', 'will', 'lose', 'everything', 'while', 'love', 'career', 'friends.This', 'debut', 'feature', 'Jieho', 'Lee', 'Korean-American', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'wrote', 'script', 'reflection', 'journey', 'bimodal', 'world', 'cinematography', 'well', 'suited', 'description', 'bimodal', 'colors', 'are', 'very', 'stark', 'terrifying', 'chiaroscuro', 'presence', 'dual', 'tone', 'universe', 'preface', 'destiny', 'have', 'set', 'out', 'not', 'independently', 'others', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'outstanding', 'consummate', 'performance', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'who', 'be', 'getting', 'better', 'time', 'roles', 'flaky', 'horned-up', 'supercilious', 'nephew', 'Garcia', 'role', 'played', 'Emile', 'Hirsch.The', 'movie', 'bounces', 'several', 'themes', 'defragment', 'somber', 'reality', 'where', 'death', 'debts', 'seem', 'frustrate', 'everyone', 'who', 'heart', 'where', 'life', 'held', 'hostage', 'forces', 'threaten', 'times', 'angle.The', 'congruence', 'themes', 'intriguing', 'direction', 'fully', 'represent', 'enigma', 'ways', 'portray', 'meaningful', 'lack', 'thereof', 'essence', 'life', 'aside', 'role', 'coincidence', 'have', 'meaning', 'save', 'being', 'yarn', 'tangled', 'reeled', 'compact', 'Ultimately', 'however', 'violence', 'be', 'overbearing', 'inopportune', 'portray', 'pain', 'ordinary', 'lives', 'extraordinary', 'men', 'inexplicably', 'have', 'advantage', 'foresee', 'future', 'last', 'aspect', 'movie', 'very', 'clearly', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'effectively', 'means', 'allegorize', 'destiny', 'not', 'fit', 'pragmatics', 'narrative', 'realist', 'outlook', 'fault', 'writing', 'was', 'clearly', 'insightful', 'other', 'turns', 'are', 'deaths', 'deaths', 'several', 'cars', 'slamming', 'people', 'practice', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'Mexican', 'movie', 'Amores', 'Perros', 'was', 'also', 'debts.Herein', 'think', 'much', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'restraint', 'practices', 'regards', 'theme', 'debts', 'was', 'case', 'theme', 'destiny', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'hold', 'riveted', 'screen', 'thanks', 'stories', 'intersect', 'diverge', 'only', 'meet', 'future', 'one', 'pop-star', 'who', 'running', 'away', 'past', 'present', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'be', 'viewed.A', 'movie', 'lot', 'questions', 'too', 'bad', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'ask']",N/A
1147626,A129YBX5BVNW2,B0014Z4OKW,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[0, 0]","Basing itself on the four cornerstones of an ancient Chinese proverb &#8211; Happiness, Pleasure, Sorrow and Love - &#34;The Air I Breathe&#34; offers up cleverly interlocked stories of desperate men and women reaching for freedom &#8211; some succeeding &#8211; some failing.Each week the mild-mannered never-does-anything with his life Stock Market Investor (Forest Whittaker as Happiness) takes packets of money from a tall nameless man who seems like somebody&#8217;s reluctant but effective henchman (Brendan Fraser as Pleasure). This guy only wants the dough spread quietly and in small amounts across safe investments. But Happiness wonders why - with his blemishless predictability track record on the future - this man doesn&#8217;t gamble more in the pursuit of more?And on hearing from braggarts in his office toilets of an 8-to-1 fixed race that night downtown &#8211; Happiness decides to do just &#8211; gamble money on a horse that has his favourite word as a name &#8211; Butterfly. But Butterfly doesn&#8217;t fly and now Happiness owes $50,000 to &#34;Fingers&#34; &#8211; a brutal and cold-hearted monster that keeps telling everyone he&#8217;s really a nice man (&#34;You think I enjoy this!&#34;) as he removes the said appendage when they don&#8217;t pay up on time (a sensationally good Andy Garcia).  In desperation and in terror Happiness now goes for it and literally robs a bank &#8211; but in his getaway gets trapped on a rooftop with marksmen pointing their rifles at him.While this is all going on an emotionally fragile but worshiped pop singer called Trista (Sarah Michelle Geller as Sorrow) gets contractually sold by her feckless gambling manager to the ruthless &#34;Fingers&#34; who in no uncertain terms tells Trista what her music future will entail (slavery to him for money and not even pregnancy will get in his way). But what Fingers doesn&#8217;t bargain for is his mentally complex henchman Pleasure (who has the gift of seeing moments into the future so he always knows what people are going to do) needing to break free from his soulless life of violence and thuggery for money. Pleasure sees the caged bird in Trista and falls in love &#8211; vowing to protect her no matter what the physical cost.On the other side of town a kindly Doctor (Kevin Bacon as Love) who has been in love with a friend&#8217;s wife (Julie Delpy as Gina) for years needs a rare blood type to save her from a venous snakebite that will kill her within 24 hours. And on it goes to a smiling woman (free at last) making a getaway at the end&#8230;Written by JIEHO LEE (who also Directed) and BOB DeROSA &#8211; &#34;The Air I Breathe&#34; uses the same disjointed flashbacks techniques that &#8220;Babel&#8221; did and builds up an interconnecting story that is both touching and satisfying. Fraser who is typecast as nice guys most of the time gets to spread his wings - as do all the other huge talents on display. It&#8217;s quite ingeniously put together.I had to buy the GERMAN BLU RAY which means you must set it up to play English 5.1 Audio and with English subtitles if needs be. It&#8217;s REGION FREE (so no compatibility problems) and the picture is superb throughout. The extras include interviews with Fraser, Garcia and Geller and Outtakes.I loved &#34;The Air I Breathe&#34; &#8211; it has humanity at the centre of life&#8217;s nastiness and a lot of that portrayal has to go to the lethal combo of good writing and quality actors delivering the goods. Pleasure says to Happiness (referring to the fear he knows consumes him) &#8211; &#34;Sometimes risking everything is the only choice you have&#8230;&#34; Spread your wings for this Butterfly&#8230; it&#8217;s worth it.PS - For UK and European Buyers Reading This:The American BLU RAY issue on Image Entertainment is REGION A LOCKED - so it won't play on our machines unless they're chipped to be 'all regions' (which few are).

1147627,A3G4BFD7FN8VF1,B0014Z4OKW,Marvin Powell,"[0, 0]","""The Air I Breathe"" represents an ancient Chinese proverb that says the emotional pillars to life are Happiness, Pleasure, Sorrow, and Love. I think they forgot anger, and a few others in there, but whatever.This movie tells the tale of four intertwinded stories of four different lives, each of which representing and codenamed after the emotion they long for most, except in Trista's (Sarah Michelle Gellar) case.SYNAPSIS (Don't keep reading if you don't want to know the story!):Forest Whitaker is a humble banker who went to school and tried to make something of himself like the rest of us, but works a crummy job that doesn't pay enough and most importantly, is unhappy in his rut of a routine work life. His story chronologically comes last. After he meets the wealthy mob henchman who represents Pleasure (Brendan Frasier, surprisngly good, here), Happiness chooses to be like him and takes his advice of ""risking it all."" He overhears a few of the middle-management guys talk about a fix in a horse race with 8-to-1 odds and decides to follow them to the illegal betting joint and risk all his cash on his the lucky horse, named after his favorite creature, the Butterfly. During the race, Butterfly unexpectly stumbles over and Happiness is suddenly in deep trouble as he meets reluctant bad guy and mobster, Fingers. (played by Andy Garcia, but clearly written for Al Pacino, or even DeNiro) He's named so for his torture technique of cutting off fingers and plays the antagonist to everyone in this movie. Fingers gives Happiness two weeks to come up with the money and is greeted by Pleasure, Fingers' right hand man (no pun intended), who decides to not beat him up for some reason we don't yet know. He gives a gun and a fighting chance. Happiness decides to rob his own bank, knowing all the tricks and security of it all, and goes about with his elaborate plan. And in the process, as he's being chased down by SWAT and police, realizes that he just robbed a bank, and is being pursuited by the police, and he's never been happier, as he now is no longer the catepillar and is now, a butterfly.Pleasure's story, the chronologically first, is that he can predict the future, but no matter what, can't change the outcome, making life predictable and numb for him. Fingers came across him and uses his gift to make both of them very rich. Pleasure now serves as his top henchman and enforcer. His job this week is to show his nephew Tony (Emile Hirsch, from ""Alpha Dog"") a good time out. Tony, a contemptible, foul-mouthed teenager is all about losing his virginity and comes to town (most likely, it's L.A.) to do that. That's when Pleasure gets the vision of Tony's death. Knowing he can't change what's gonna happen, he goes out onto the streets to think and leaves Tony at a brothel, run by Jiyoung (Kelly Hu), one of Finger's protection clients. Deciding to take a chance of saving Tony anyway, he returns once Tony bothers a high, easily agitated hooker and she steals a powerful gangster's gun and goes off on everyone. Tony and the hooker wrestle for the gun and they end up accidently shooting and killing the mob boss, leaving Tony to be rescued just in time by Pleasure from his goons. They are pursued through to an alleyway where Tony is supposed to die when he falls off a barb wire gate. However, when they climb, Tony makes it over and it's Pleasure who falls, leaving him to be badly beaten up by the mobster's hired goons. But despite the physical pain, he's never felt more pleasure as he can now wake up everyday, knowing that he can control his destiny and change fate. This realization though, rids him of his future sight,a nd he is rushed to a hospital and treated by a doctor, codenamed Love (Kevin Bacon).Sorrow's story comes third, as she is living her dream life as a famous pop singer. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays her and Trista's a slightly more sympathetic version of Krysta Now, from Southland Tales. Krysta, Trista, coincidence? Anyway, despite her dream life of semi-fame  and semi-fortune, she's haunted by the memory of her father's death from when she was a child. Trista is the only protagonist in the whole movie who already has the emotion they are codenamed for. After an interview with a ""shock"" host who reveals her to be nothing special and noteworthy, other than her rare Kp AB blood type, Trista falls into a deep depression, which only gets worse when her manager ends up as another of Finger's victims and is forced to sell Trista's contract to him. Fingers, with somewhat of a desire to go legit, decides to invest all his time in making Trista go from a mediocre pop star, to a superstar. However, he's pretty upset when he finds out that the manager drained Trista's account, leaving her bankrupt and finacially worthless to Fingers. He declares that she's his property until she becomes a finacial success, again. Pleasure, fresh out the hospital, is sent to reinforce this into Trista, but with the epiphany he has now about changing fate, decides he's going to do what he wants to do and decides to hide out Trista at his place and protect her from his boss. Trista deeply appreciates the gesture and while there, falls in love for the first time with her Knight in Bloody Armor. Pleasure, now free from his numbness, falls in love with Trista, too, having never had an emotional connection with anyone since his kid brother died some twenty years ago. However, Fingers enventually finds out about Trista (who's secret real legal name is Sorrow) and ambushes Pleasure as he returns home, to find a tied up and gagged Sorrow. Fingers blames Pleasure's betrayal on Sorrow and deems him no longer useful as his future sight has clearly gone away, as he was able to be ambushed so easily.The final story, which is the most disconnected from the others, is the story of Dr. Love, Kevin Bacon, who is also Pleasure's doctor. Love's one ambition in life is to find his soulmate, but has messed up too many times with potential women from letting his fears hold him back. He waited to long to act and let the love of his life, Gina, marry his best friend, a plastic surgeon. Gina's an animal researcher and gets bitten by a poisonous viper during her work. Love sets out on a quest to find her rare Kp AB blood and overhears Trista's interview where she had an emotional breakdown. Now forced to perform under Finger's authority, Trista/Sorrow has only two choices on her mind: run-away or suicide. Love runs up to Trista's show and comes off too much like a crazed fan rather than a doctor trying to save his love's life. Outside, he comes across Trista, right as she's about to take a cab to the airport and is unable to explain the situation rationally enough before accidently hurting Trista/Sorrow and himself. He gets arrested and has the deeply depressing feeling of failure sink in in the police car. Meanwhile, Trista has suffered a concussion. She wakes up in the hospital early in the morning, with the news that she's three months pregnant with Pleasure's child. But Fingers refuses to let her keep the baby, as it will interfere with her career and financial debts. Trista/Sorrow, with no way out, contemplates suicide by leaping off the hospital roof and is noticed just in time by Love, who refues to fail this second time around. Love saves Sorrow's life, and Sorrow's rare blood is able to save Love's love, Gina. Somewhat happier now by her blood saving a life, Sorrow gets ready to adjust to her trapped life, when she comes across Happiness in the street, and is given his stolen money by an act of karma. The money is enough to escape Finger's debt and get away from him forever, with a new purpose in life, that of her unborn child's happiness, not her own.The Air I Breathe was written and directed by first time writer/director Jieho Lee and is good, considering it's this writer/director's first ever project. Big name stars, an intersting story (if not completely original), and a thoroughly entertaining movie. Sure, it gets a little bit pretenious at times, with the Butterfly themes throughout that don't really add too much to things, but it's ultimately a movie about four characters and four emotions we all experience throughout life, or at least, long to. Without love, there is sorrow, and without sorrow, happiness is meaningless. Pleasure gives us momentary happiness, but without pleasure, life is pretty unlively and you're not bound to be too happy.This movie isn't perfect, but it's well worth watching and a very impressive entry by Jieho Lee. It's just quite a shame that this movie didn't premiere in US theaters so that more people would have a chance to see it. Sure,you can say that it's ""Crash lite,"" but is that really a bad thing? I don't think so.",4,It'll make you think...,1220572800,"09 5, 2008",2008,8758,"['Air', 'Breathe', 'ancient', 'Chinese', 'proverb', 'emotional', 'pillars', 'life', 'are', 'Happiness', 'Pleasure',

1147629,A38MLLWYZGMQ04,B0014Z4OKW,"Miss DIckens ""Miss Dickens""","[20, 22]","First of all I am biased: I love films that tell stories about lives that impact other lives through small coincidental moments.  Another reviewer of this movie used the term ""butterfly effect."" I automatically give this kind of film three stars even if it is a Tom and Jerry cartoon. Given this bias, I am rating this film four and a half stars because I was quite taken by the theme that tied the four stories together.The rest is spoiler, so don't read any further unless you have seen the film already.For me at least, this film was about the monotony and the banality of our lives that are the by product of conformity, routine and safety.  Each of the characters in the four stories are leading lives of quiet desparation. Their daily life consists of monotonous routine and they are all emotionally inert.Each character is protected and ""safe"" within the framework of their life and each takes a huge risk that catapaults them out of their cocoons into something bigger then their original selves. Through risk, danger, and moments of intense and reawakened feeling, they experience, however briefly,a peak moment of humanity that makes the risk worthwhile even though it may end in death.The ""Happiness"" segment is about a stockbroker, a man who jumped through all the right hoops, fit quietly into society, and now live on the verge of despair until the moment he takes a monumental risk, and steps outside his boundaries to spend a glorious hour as a criminal living entirely in the moment, totally alive right up to the moment of his death, having had one brief shining moment of a happiness that bordered on ecstacy.""Pleasure"" gives us a criminal whose life, although outside the law, is equally as boring and banal as the stockbrokers because of its total predictability and unvarying routine. When circumstances destoy his safety net, our criminal experiences pleasure: initially from the experience of pain and subsequently from caring for someone other than himself.""Sorrow"" is the story of an almost-celebrity singer who surrounded by entourage and the insulation of an entatainer's world is also living a life of monotony and banality. With the promise of stardom on the horizen, the singer destroys her safety net by choosing freedom and is awakened to her humanity through fear and sorrow.""Love"" is yet another view of the same theme. In this case a physician who lost the love of his life because he opted for emotional safety and failed to act.  The eminent death of his loves pushes him outside his comfortable boundaries and he takes action in ways that would have been beyond the self-efacing ways of his ordinary and monotonous life.When all is said and done, the film is about breaking boundaries to find a moment of passion and of real humanity, regardless of the consequences.  The cast, from the leads to the supporting roles, were all very good, and in some cases outstanding. Actors of the stature of Whitaker, Fraser, Geller, Bacon and Delpy deserve our thanks for accepting parts in small budget films such as these. They bring a good script to life, and provide opportunities for new indie directors.The Air I Breathe [Blu-ray]",4,The Air I Breathe-A Rough Gem for Some Viewers,1212451200,"06 3, 2008",2008,3162,"['First', 'am', 'biased', 'love', 'films', 'tell', 'stories', 'lives', 'impact', 'other', 'lives', 'small', 'coincidental', 'moments', 'reviewer', 'movie', 'used', 'term', 'butterfly', 'effect', 'automatically', 'give', 'kind', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'even', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'cartoon', 'Given', 'bias', 'am', 'rating', 'film', 'four', 'half', 'was', 'quite', 'taken', 'theme', 'tied', 'four', 'stories', 'together.The', 'rest', 'spoiler', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'further', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'least', 'film', 'was', 'monotony', 'banality', 'lives', 'are', 'product', 'conformity', 'routine', 'safety', 'characters', 'four', 'stories', 'are', 'leading', 'lives', 'quiet', 'desparation', 'daily', 'life', 'monotonous', 'routine', 'are', 'emotionally', 'inert.Each', 'character', 'protected', 'safe', 'framework', 'life', 'huge', 'risk', 'cocoons', 'something', 'bigger', 'then', 'original', 'selves', 'risk', 'danger', 'moments', 'intense', 'reawakened', 'feeling', 'experience', 'however', 'briefly', 'peak', 'moment', 'humanity', 'risk', 'worthwhile', 'even', 'may', 'end', 'death.The', 'Happiness', 'segment', 'stockbroker', 'man', 'who', 'jumped', 'right', 'hoops', 'fit', 'quietly', 'society', 'now', 'live', 'verge', 'despair', 'moment', 'monumental', 'risk', 'steps', 'boundaries', 'spend', 'glorious', 'hour', 'criminal', 'living', 'entirely', 'moment', 'totally', 'alive', 'right', 'up', 'moment', 'death', 'having', 'had', 'one', 'brief', 'shining', 'moment', 'happiness', 'bordered', 'ecstacy', 'Pleasure', 'criminal', 'life', 'law', 'equally', 'boring', 'banal', 'stockbrokers', 'total', 'predictability', 'unvarying', 'routine', 'When', 'circumstances', 'destoy', 'safety', 'net', 'criminal', 'experiences', 'pleasure', 'initially', 'experience', 'pain', 'subsequently', 'caring', 'someone', 'other', 'Sorrow', 'story', 'almost-celebrity', 'singer', 'who', 'surrounded', 'entourage', 'insulation', 'entatainer', 'world', 'also', 'living', 'life', 'monotony', 'banality', 'promise', 'stardom', 'horizen', 'singer', 'safety', 'net', 'choosing', 'freedom', 'awakened', 'humanity', 'fear', 'sorrow', 'Love', 'yet', 'view', 'same', 'theme', 'case', 'physician', 'who', 'lost', 'love', 'life', 'opted', 'emotional', 'safety', 'failed', 'act', 'eminent', 'death', 'loves', 'comfortable', 'boundaries', 'action', 'ways', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'self-efacing', 'ways', 'ordinary', 'monotonous', 'life.When', 'said', 'done', 'film', 'breaking', 'boundaries', 'find', 'moment', 'passion', 'real', 'humanity', 'regardless', 'consequences', 'cast', 'leads', 'supporting', 'roles', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'cases', 'outstanding', 'Actors', 'stature', 'Whitaker', 'Fraser', 'Geller', 'Bacon', 'Delpy', 'deserve', 'thanks', 'accepting', 'parts', 'small', 'budget', 'films', 'such', 'bring', 'good', 'script', 'life', 'provide', 'opportunities', 'new', 'indie', 'directors.The', 'Air', 'Breathe', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']']",N/A

1147632,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B0014Z4OKW,Muzzlehatch,"[1, 1]","I've read a little bit about this, and it seems to draw a lot of comparisons to CRASH and BABEL - I guess just because each of them offers multiple stories that interesect in not-entirely-predictable ways. It's really not all that similar to those earlier (and much more high-profile) films apart from that element - there's not much of anything in the way of politics or racial content in this film, for one thing; this is not a film about ""society"" but about individuals and how they interact.  For another, though one might call the central thesis of the film - an examination of the four ""emotional cornerstones"" ( happiness, pleasure, sorrow and love) of human life as described in an old Chinese proverb, here literally invested in the four main characters - ""pretentious"", the film itself is certainly working on a lower-key and a simpler method than the earlier films, which allows many of the actors to come off as a bit less self-conscious, and the film in the end to seem ""modest"" in a way. Which is all to the good, as the screenplay and some of the secondary characters definitely get in the way of real success.Each main character has a storyline, and though there are connections they basically move from one to the next in a relatively linear (certainly easy to follow) fashion, with each taking up roughly the same amount of screentime. None of the four principals are named, though ""Sorrow"" (Sara Michelle Gellar), a pop singer, does have a stage name. ""Happiness"" begins with Forest Whitaker as an apparently frustrated office robot betting a ton of money on a hot tip he got, and then being indebted heavily to a completely and totally evil gangster, Fingers (Andy Garcia); ""Pleasure"" (Brendan Fraser) shows him a way out. Then we segue into Pleasure's story - he's Fingers' chief enforcer, gifted with a particular extranormal power; tonight he's got the job of showing the boss's punk kid nephew (Emile Hirsch) around the town - and finding that his life has changed in a special way.  ""Sorrow"" is Trista (Gellar), an aspiring singer whose indebted manager is forced to sell her contract to - you guessed it - Fingers. Her life is pretty much unending and awful misery, including a flashback to the terrible (but ludicrous and frankly hilarious in the way it's shown) death of her father. Well, at least it gives Gellar a chance to cry, something she's exceptionally good at. And finally, her sorrow somehow becomes the saving grace for ""Love"" (Kevin Bacon), a doctor who's had a mad unrequited love for a herpatologist (Julie Delpy) who gets bitten by a rare snake and...well, I'm not going to spoil it. Suffice it to say that as usual for these kinds of things, many of the stories come together in the end and the audience is left...Unfulfilled - at least in my case. One of the big problems I have with this kind of set-up is that it is essentially asking us to see life as a big, cosmic game, a series of Dickensian coincidences and bizarre occurences that somehow at the end add up to peoples' lives being changed irrevocably. This kind of thing CAN work if done in a fantasy milieu or a magical-realist type of setting, but when a film tries for the most part to offer ""realistic"" portrayals of semi-real people, it just ends up seeming stupid and laughable.  THE AIR I BREATHE tries to do it both ways - most of the characters are living with real-life (if very dramatic) problems, but Brendan Fraser's special ability invests the whole thing with a veneer of the supernatural - which just doesn't add up to anything more that a convenient way out of many plot holes, from what I can see.  The number of car crashes and near-crashes in the film is enough to make you start to wonder when the next one is going to happen just at the right moment, and there are lots of other coincidental things like that. We have one of the most poorly-staged and unbelievable bank robberies I've ever seen; several completely idiotic mistakes by characters that result in massive storyline shifts; and a couple of secondary characters (Garcia and Hirsch) who are so cartoonish that we can't care about them or what they do for a moment. Ultimately it just feels like writer-director Lee came up with a bunch of events and characters he wanted to put in a movie, and then tried to create a thin and fairly obvious story so he could to fit them all together.It is, as I mentioned, redeemed a fair amount by the acting.  I'm typically a guy who follows directors and genres, rather than actors, but Bacon, Whitaker and Delpy are a few of my favorite current actors that I'll make an effort to see in anything, and they're all their usual excellent selves, though Delpy's role is pretty minimal. Fraser is probably the best I've ever seen him be - I'm not typically a fan, and don't think much of him in his ""Indiana Jones""-type adventure roles; perhaps he's best off in the contemporary urban drama/thriller setting.  I'm a huge fan of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" but I haven't always been a fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar's work outside of the show, so it's nice to be able to say that she holds her own here as well, giving the best film performance I've seen from her. So I guess if you're a fan of any or all the principals here, it's worth catching; as many problems as I have with the film, it never bored me, and the leads kept it watchable for me.The responses vary quite a bit with this one, and I'm not sure I could predict how most people would react - if you've read this far in my review I hope it's helpful, but I'd suggest reading several others as

Shows how one can make a good film on a tight budget with a rookie director and a great cast.Some nice music from the Teddybears and thoughtful prop management on making the city look American (as most of it was not filmed here).

Four distinct stories that all come together as one bigger story.Each story stands alone, but you see the successive stories you learn more about what has happened to characters you may only have seen in passing in the previous story.The cast is talented enough, though the acting is at times uneven.  In addition the inherent violence and shocking events that make up the vignettes and bigger story make the film somewhat difficult to consume.  The overall tone is dark and depressing for the most part while offering examples of Love, Pleasure, Sorrow and Happiness (not necessarily in that order).Rental before purchase is highly recommended for this film.

The film is broken up into four parts that are out of order, and the characters all do eventually interact, there is also a mafia angle to the film, but overall besides the way things were laid out, I didn't really draw much of a comparison to Pulp Fiction. The stories all involve these peoples interactions with the mob, but they're all for different reasons and all have different outcomes. Andy Garcia is the boss, of course, always the perfect choice for a gangster or ruthless leader, and you get from him what's expected. What isn't expected is the tremendous performance of Brendan Fraser. I am not a fan and have never really considered him anything but a mediocre comedic actor, but after seeing The Air I Breathe, my opinion of him was definitely swayed. While watching the pieces, I knew they would somehow come together, but the way it was done was completely unpredictable and really something to watch. The film had a huge cast, with a ton of cameos, and just as many twists and turns. What I was expecting was far different from what I saw and I was more than happy with the way the film was done.

He loses the bet and owes the money to the dangerous and powerful mobster Fingers. A gangster has the ability of foreseeing the future and works for Fingers; he is assigned to collect money for the boss with his troublemaker nephew Tony and is beat up by a gang. The manager of the pop-star Trista loses her contract to Fingers without her agreement and she is threatened by the gangster. A doctor seeks a blood donor that might have a rare blood type to save the life of his passion. While some may find a couple of the actors a bit deadpan, they pretty much are solid throughout while consistent in their characterizations. Whitaker and Fraser especially fit that description. Both are quite stoic in their roles, but that's what the story demands.  Bacon is a delight and is perfectly cast as a would-be hero. Andy Garcia is a chilling and devilish nemesis throughout, while Emile Hirsch provides some comic relief in his brief appearance. ""The Air I Breathe"" is, at its heart, a character piece which follows a general theme. Seems simple. On the face of it, it plays out like a crime drama.
