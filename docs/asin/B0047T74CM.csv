Edward Norton's character has a horrible ""gangster"" accent that doesn't translate into the real-life nitty gritty it's supposed to portray. As the film goes on, he loses more and more of it but the first 10 minutes of hearing him speak I was cringing the whole time. DeNiro was DeNiro, but even he couldn't hold together a no-lot borefest that left more answers than resolutions. It was intended to have more of an impact on the audience, but even with all of the religious questions and dramatic ""epiphanies"" it fell incredibly short of its mark. I honestly thought that DeNiro was going to kill himself in the end, and I honestly think it would've been a better ending.",3,High Hopes for a Dismal Film,1316131200,"09 16, 2011",2011,774,"['had', 'incredibly', 'high', 'hopes', 'movie', 'featuring', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Boy', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'character', 'horrible', 'gangster', 'accent', ""n't"", 'translate', 'real-life', 'nitty', 'gritty', 'supposed', 'portray', 'film', 'more', 'more', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'hearing', 'speak', 'was', 'cringing', 'whole', 'time', 'DeNiro', 'was', 'DeNiro', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'hold', 'together', 'no-lot', 'borefest', 'left', 'more', 'answers', 'resolutions', 'was', 'intended', 'have', 'more', 'impact', 'audience', 'even', 'religious', 'questions', 'dramatic', 'epiphanies', 'fell', 'incredibly', 'short', 'mark', 'honestly', 'thought', 'DeNiro', 'was', 'going', 'kill', 'end', 'honestly', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'ending']",Stone
1388803,ADFLPF6FI3W0O,B0047T74CM,ASP,"[3, 5]","This is a review of the DVD version of the film STONE.Performances by De Niro, Norton, and Jovovich are quite good in this film, except for when you first meet Norton's character. Norton's performance and portrayal of the charcter is not fully believeable in the beginning, but as the character develops, the performance becomes more believable and more interesting.  De Niro's character is not too interesting since he's just a desk worker on the verge of retirement, but his character does become more interesting. He wants to finish up his last few cases before he retires.  Norton's character (Stone) slowly develops and we find out what kind of person he really is. Norton does a great job with this character for most of the film. Jovovich's character is interesting and Milla does a great job with this character.The film is 105 minutes. The story progresses along, and there are just one or two boring sequences. Otherwise, the story is interesting.  The plot and story isn't a strong one, but it is watchable.  The ending could have been stronger, but it feels like something was missing or left out.  The camera work is well done and enjoyable.  The extras and Special Features are interesting, but not must-watch features.The movie was watchable and interesting and I did not think about stopping it or turning it off. It's not an exciting film, but as an independent film it does focus on character development even though the development isn't as strong as I would prefer.

Oh, and George actually does have a real light saber! Anyway, those are the few snippets I could remember when I woke up the following morning. I also found a copy of an interesting e-mail in my back pocket. Thought I'd share it with you. I have, of course, removed the e-mail addresses so I don't have to go through the chore of redacting them later:March 5, 2009Attn: Mimran Schur PicturesRe: ""Stone""Dear Mr. Mimran,It has come to our attention that the script has become unworkable, a feat we feel has been quite acerbated by Glenn Beck signing on as a ghost producer. What in its original form was a meaningful study of morality and basic human impulses has lately devolved into an ambling discourse on religion that at times border on fringe spiritual cults such as Eckankar.Since we can't afford to fall out of favor with Rupert Murdoch (or George Soros for that matter), we feel that our hands are tied at this point regarding any remedies to the script. We feel the best possible thing to do at this point would be to consider bringing in Edward Norton to play the title role. He has expressed interest because he feels pigeonholed in the ""Hulk"" franchise. And, as we all know, Edward Norton is like cinematic bacon; he makes everything better.

1388805,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0047T74CM,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Robert De Niro plays the role of a parole officer, and his job is to determine whether this one prisoner (Ed Norton's character) should be released from prison or not based on a few lengthy discussions the two of them have in a small and dingy office room concerning Ed's troubled actions in the past.It turns out that the prisoners extremely attractive wife (Milla Jovovich's character) eventually has her own sleazy ways of getting her husband out of prison, but I won't spoil how it happens (despite several reviews already doing it here on amazon- be careful when reading other reviews, because others have spoiled the storyline quite a bit).Yes, some of the segments bordered on weird or incoherent, but I seriously do not believe Stone is nearly as confusing as many say it is.  This is because much of the storyline is totally up to interpretation.  The opening scene for example, has a few different ways to interpret, and how it may or may not connect to the rest of the storyline.  Actually, this particular scene had me fooled into thinking Robert De Niro was a psychopath and would eventually explode... and because of something that happens later on, hey, maybe he *was* crazy, I don't know.  I don't wanna name the exact segment later in the movie that I'm referring to.I really think people who are trashing Stone are placing too much emphasis on plot coherence, or a simple explanation at the very end to tie all the events together.  Which is totally fine of course, but I happened to admire the different ways to analyze it.Also, I definitely did NOT think this was a boring film, unlike many people.  Apparently a good number of people who watched it spent the majority of their time looking at the clock and waiting for it to end.  I, on the other hand, was on the edge of my seat (well... I was actually standing on the cold kitchen floor, hehe) totally glued to my television set.There were literally several different ways this storyline could have gone, and I applaud the writers for making it a neverending guessing game.

1388815,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B0047T74CM,Chris Kennison,"[22, 26]","STONE is dubbed a ""psychological duel"", and it is. Robert Deniro plays Jack, a parole officer who holds all the cards in the life of Stone (Edward Norton) a convicted arsonist who is pleading his case to be released from prison, back into society. Stone will stop at nothing, including using his wife to manipulate Jack.The movie leads you to believe that you know and understand all the characters involved but they go different directions as the movie goes along. It does a pheonominal job of progressing its characters and revealing more and more about who they were and who they are becoming.With guys like Robert DeNiro and Edward Norton and a superbly underated and fearless actress Milla Jovovich, STONE is an outstanding character study and may hit home with a lot of people who could be going through life in an unhappy marriage or living life without hope. It is impossible to give too much insight without giving away important elements to the story.  The story elements and plots changes are so subtle they don't actually hit you until the afterfact, which is brilliant.I'm afraid that STONE has a lot of machinery and mechanics going on, only to drive to nowhere.

In this film, he has redeemed himself. DeNiro plays a somewhat jaded parole officer who is weeks from retirement; he appears to be disconnected from his job and his wife, played by Frances Conroy. He asks his boss if he can finish off his cases and ends up with the file of a convicted arsonist, superbly played by Edward Norton. During their mandatory meetings, Norton tries to persuade DeNiro to help him get an early release. He involves his wife, played by Milla Jovovich, who decides to seduce DeNiro.As the movie progresses, you are never sure as to what Norton's motives are as well as his wife's. DeNiro is fantastic as a man battling between the bureaucratic appropriateness (and lethargy) of his position vs his desire. Norton is also fantastic in his role because you are never quite sure what he is up to. Jovovich is terrific and Conroy as well.The movie begins with a scene between DeNiro and his wife when they were young. I waited throughout the entire film for that scene to be explained, yet it never was. The effect, however, was that I was kept on my toes throughout the movie wondering what DeNiro's character truly portrayed -- evil, goodness, or a combination.The highlight of this movie was Edward Norton.

There is nudity and a lot of really nasty language, I mean a lot.Another thing that bugs me is the horrible scratching background noise throughout the movie. It really gets annoying after a while.

Even those I have enjoyed often do not leave much behind. Not so with this one.It begins with a dark event that I thought overshadowed the rest of the movie. This event is little developed afterward, and it is not directly related to the main plot. But it's really in every scene.  It shows that Jack Mabry (Robert De Niro) is not the man that he pretends to be. He pretends to be a gruff, tough, fair-minded prison parole officer who is willing to impartially judge those inmates brought before him as candidates for parole. But the aforementioned event and his further actions in the film show that he is truly a lowlife. He is no better a person than ""Stone"" Creeson (Edward Norton), who is brought before him as a parole candidate or Creeson's wife, Lucetta (Milla Jovovich), who will do ""anything"" to help get Stone paroled.The acting is consistently outstanding. De Niro becomes Jack Mabry. Norton is most convincing as a profoundly disturbed man who turns to a New Wave-type belief system for relief. He is highly manipulative and desperately wants to get out of prison, but he is strong enough to admit to Mabry that he is not really remorseful about the terrible crime he committed. Jovovich's Lucetta is fascinatingly complex. She uses her considerabe charms to seduce Mabry and seems to ""lack all restraint.""Yet another gem of a performance is that of Frances Conroy, who portrays Mabry's wife, Madylyn.  She's a Bible-thumping, hard-drinking woman who has remained married to Jack for over four decades. But this is certainly not a marriage grounded in love.This may be one of those movies that is generally panned by the critics, is not a big box office smash, but is eventually recognized as a great film.

On the one hand, I am supposed to believe that Jack Mabry is a hard working honest straight-laced corrections officer in a prison. And I'm also supposed to believe that Stone and his wife are the exact opposite, sent to tempt Jack with the apple and watch him fall. But on the other hand, in the opening flashback montage, Jack sits drinking watching golf while his wife takes care of their daughter. His wife has decided she has had enough and is going to leave him. Jack runs upstairs and hangs his daughter out the window, if she leaves, he will throw her out the window. Flash forward many years to Jack interviewing Stone for his parole hearing. Eventually Stone's wife convinces Jack to go back to her place and they have sex.The moral tension didn't work. I dislike Jack from the outset. I dislike Stone slightly more. And I dislike his wife even more. The problem, there is no conflict. The moral conflict played out in the first thirty minutes of the film. Jack fell too quickly and easily. I was left with another hour and fifteen minutes for the big payoff resolution in the film - was it a plan, did Stone know about the fall, will Jack's wife find out, was Jack just a willing player, will Stone get his parole? By the time the big reveal happens, I was exhausted and bored with the film, and had already figured out the ending forty minutes earlier.The sole saving grace of this film are the three lead actors, Robert DeNiro (Jack Mabry), Edward Norton (Stone), and Milla Jovovich (Lucetta, Stone's wife). Without such strong actors, this film would be insufferable. Edward Norton does a decent job with the Detroit accent, occasionally falling out of character (but a case could be made that his accent changed as he was redeemed). Milla Jovovich is simply gorgeous - her piercing blue eyes are stunning, and she has an incredible body.Technically this was not a good film. Eighty percent of the shots were perfectly composed and rock solid. The other twenty were television hand held camera style that were annoying. The film is a solid forty-five minutes too long.The film is rated R. Probably not a film for younger viewers (some R rated films can be acceptable for more mature young viewers). There is a lot of strong language. Milla Jovovich is shown nude several times. There are a number of graphic scenes, one nasty scene of a murder, and another of a prisoner being stabbed to death with blood everywhere. This is a film intended for adults.I did not enjoy Stone.

1388824,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B0047T74CM,Douglas King,"[1, 3]","At its core, ""Stone"" is about moral ambiguity. There are no heroes or villains or ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" in this film. Each of the four main characters is morally gray ... seemingly capable of noble intentions as well as cruelty and destruction.The first scene of the film is a flashback of the main character, Jack, and his wife when they were a young couple with a young child: and, boy, is it like a punch in the gut. In this short, brutal first scene, Jack's character is quickly revealed: he's a steely man capable of vicious manipulation. Flash forward 30-40 years, and Jack is a parole officer about to retire, still with his wife, played by Francis Conroy (btw, the young actors who portray the young DeNiro and Conroy are perfectly cast), a seemingly upright, church-going, dutiful public servant.While tying up his loose ends at work, Jack comes across Stone, a convict up for early release. Stone is talkative, restless, slippery, and magnetic as many convicts are. Jack and Stone the characters are like a cobra and a mongoose. Robert DeNiro and Edward Norton the actors are equally matched in talent, intelligence, depth, and commitment to their roles. On the surface, it seems obvious what's happening: Stone wants Jack to help with his early release, and is willing to do what it takes, including allowing his beautiful wife Lucetta to seduce him. But there's an equally powerful parallel storyline at work: Stone has an epiphany while watching a man die in prison, and pursues a new religion, which seems to be the beginning of a genuine spiritual awakening. At the same time, Jack seems to be losing his religion, becoming dismissive of the Christian rituals that still inspires his wife, drinking heavily, and oh-so-easily being led into temptation by Lucetta.The film takes on a lot - so if it stumbles a little, it's easy to forgive it.

De Niro gives the usual strong performance in playing Mabry, a character who continues to surprise with the way he straddles the line in his struggle between decent man and utter scumbag. Mabry also very effectively shows the dilemmas that parole officers face every day.The suspense here is more psychological than eventful. Being more of a character film than a plot film, ""Stone"" may leave many wanting more dramatic stuff to happen even though there are a few good twists and surprises here. Still, it compensates with some very interesting usage of symbolism, parallels, and foreshadowings, and consistently touches on spiritual and metaphysical questions without seeming too preachy or dogmatic.I'm glad I saw this.",4,A Thriller that Goes Beyond,1354406400,"12 2, 2012",2012,1271,"['Stone', 'bit', 'places', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'vague', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'anti-climactic', 'strong', 'impression', 'many', 'films', 'type', 'not', 'instantly', 'forgettable', 'once', 'credits', 'start', 'rolling.Superb', 'acting', 'really', 'carry', 'Norton', 'charismatically', 'convincing', 'con', 'Jovovich', 'one', 'most', 'realistically', 'conniving', 'vamps', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'witnessed', 'Frances', 'Conroy', 'Mabry', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'perhaps', 'strongest', 'performer', 'playing', 'character', 'who', 'so', 'painful', 'get', 'ignored', 'De', 'Niro', 'usual', 'strong', 'performance', 'playing', 'Mabry', 'character', 'who', 'surprise', 'way', 'line', 'struggle', 'decent', 'man', 'utter', 'scumbag', 'Mabry', 'also', 'very', 'effectively', 'dilemmas', 'officers', 'face', 'day.The', 'suspense', 'here', 'more', 'psychological', 'eventful', 'Being', 'more', 'character', 'film', 'plot', 'film', 'Stone', 'may', 'leave', 'many', 'wanting', 'more', 'dramatic', 'stuff', 'happen', 'even', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'twists', 'surprises', 'here', 'Still', 'very', 'interesting', 'usage', 'symbolism', 'parallels', 'foreshadowings', 'consistently', 'touches', 'spiritual', 'metaphysical', 'questions', 'seeming', 'too', 'preachy', 'dogmatic.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw']",Stone

Ever imagine what it would be like to continually lock-horns with a parole officer in the state of Michigan?  Me neither.  However, just in case you're curious, here is a film that is right up your alley!Ed Norton plays Stone, a convict who is locked-up for arson.  He doesn't have all of his marbles and has some serious delusions-of-grandeur.  His parole officer, Jack (Robert DeNiro) is supposed to be the adult in the room who keeps him in line.  Problem is, one wonders if Jack might be even more looney than Stone!For starters, when Jack's wife threatens to leave him, he responds by threatening to kill their daughter.  When I saw this, I thought to myself ""Boy, what a whack-job.""  A few scenes later the camera zoomed-in on Jack's university of Michigan class ring.  I thought to myself ""Ah, that explains a lot.  NO WONDER he's such a whackjob!""  The Unabomber would be proud.Milla Jovovich portrays Lucetta, Stone's nympho wife who will do virtually anything to secure an early-out for her husband.  That includes becoming involved with Jack & attempting to ""prod"" him towards the outcome she wants.The shining star of the film Milla Jovovich.  She does an outstanding job of taking on the role of a Michigander.  I mean, you close your eyes while watching the film & just listen to her & it's like she actually is(!) a Michigander!  Being from MI myself, this was very flattering.  Oh, and Milla looks terrific while she's topless too.  ;-)If you're in the mood for an off-the-wall psychological thriller where the entire movie is bereft of anyone who can be called ""sane"" then STONE is for you.

Also, I saw the opportunity to appreciate the quality of Milla Jovovich's acting other than being the sexy action hero in theResident Evil saga.The storyline is not very interesting, and sometimes it is close to weird, so not surprisingly revenues at the box office barely covered half the film's cost. The main value of the movie resides in the acting, so I think this might be an interesting flick for cinephiles. Jovovich does have a chance to do some real acting, but mixed with her sexy image and some nudity, I believe she did not get a fair chance to show us the full extent of her capabilities.

It's a simple story of a man who wants to be paroled and he asks his wife to seduce the parole officer.From the beginning, De Niro's character, Jack Mabry, is shown as a religious man.  He constantly listens to Christian talk shows on the radio, as does his wife.  And the harrowing thing about this movie for me is to see a man who is on the straight and narrow succumb to temptation.And unusual twist to the story though is, as one man spirals into self-destruction, another, Stone (Edward Norton), begins to find enlightenment.  In the end, all their lives change.The emotional tension in the film is palpable. And the binaural type background music also makes one feel like you're in another plane, almost trance-inducing.  I didn't like that too much plus the constant prattle of the radio preachers in the background.To me, ""Stone"" is not really a story about God and sin, or even good and evil, but more of a situation where people come together and the outcome is anybody's guess. It's like being presented with a moral dilemma question.I'm once again impressed with Edward Norton's acting.  He is like a chameleon.  He can change his whole persona and make you believe him.  He's got everything done to pat, even the way he sniffs his nose.  And De Niro is excellent in his portrayal of a worn-out, disinterested parole officer who is struggling with his inner demons.Mila Jovovich is also very convincing in her character.  Even her subtle movements reveal so many layers of her character that you can't afford to look away in case you miss something.As a psychological thriller, this movie has the depth, darkness, and tension that keeps the viewer on the edge.

Norton is in prison for arson and accessory to murder. He's nearing the end of his rope so he convinces his wife (Milla Jovovich) to seduce his parole review officer (DeNiro) so he'll have an edge on getting out. He also taps into a seeming pop-style, self help philosophy to stack the deck in his favor. Things don't go exactly as planned.This is a performance movie and the performances are great. Norton is outstanding. Watching his transformation throughout the film, alone, is worth the price of admission. The corn-rows, the slight rasp in the voice, the way he handles the lingo are done to a ""T.""

He has a daughter but seems to not have any real contact with her. He's on the verge of retirement and he's going through the motions. His roller coaster ride is something to behold.

1388838,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,B0047T74CM,Giordano Bruno,"[2, 4]","... about ""The Varieties of Religious Experience"" as summarized elsewhere:""""James believed that the study of the origin of an object or an idea does not play a role in the study of its value. He asserted that existential judgment, or the scientific examination of an object's origin, is a separate matter from that object's value. As an example, he alluded to the Quaker religion and its founder, George Fox. Many of the scientists in James' audience immediately reject all aspects of the Quaker religion because evidence suggests that Fox was schizophrenic. Calling this rejection medical materialism, James insisted that the origin of Fox's notions about religion should not come into account when propositioning the value of the Quaker religion. As an aside, many believe El Greco to have suffered from astigmatism, yet no one would dismiss his art based on this medical detail. James proposed, somewhat sarcastically, that his audience's atheism was perhaps a dysfunction of the liver. Some believe science to be superior to religion because of religion's seemingly vain, unfounded, or perhaps insane origin. In his lectures, James asserted that these claims, while perhaps historically or epistemologically interesting, play no role in the separate question of religion's value.""""It would be interesting to watch this odd film with William James or his ghost, since it is precisely 'a question of religion's value' that threads together the four characters: a convicted murderer (Stone), his seductive wife (Lucetta), his parole officer nearing retirement (Jack), and the officer's wife of 43 years. The two women represent the poles of religious experience, the young wife avowing amoral atheism and the older wife clinging fearfully to evangelical Christianity. It's the two men who are in crisis, with Stone experiencing 'jailhouse charisma' and Jack floundering in his collapsing belief, not only in God but in any credible human morality. William James addressed his thought to the sources of belief, material or spiritual. This film presents us with a different polarity. There are, it seems to me, two basic ""crises"" of religion: falling out of belief, as experienced by Jack, and falling into belief, as experienced by Stone. The symmetry of their experiences is the core of the film; without that almost Zoroastrian symmetry, the film can only be regarded as a turgid failure. Neither the rigid Virtue of Jack's wife nor the Sinfulness of Lucetta offers any karmic redemption. Only catharsis can yield spiritual change ... for better or worse.These are not my Values, let me hasten to declare! This is what the film appears to want to express. If you choose to watch this film as entertainment, as a ""gritty and engrossing thriller... a tale of passion, betrayal, and corruption"" (as it is billed on the DVD box), that's your business. My five-star appreciation for it is related to its earnest attempt to portray the bizarre religious frenzies and mass hysteria of an America that seems to be caught in another ""Great Awakening"".I'm not at all certain that the assorted ""makers"" of this film were in control of the film's messages, by the way. In fact, I'd guess that ""they knew not what they wrought."" For most viewers who opt to think about this film, the clear message is that ""religion"" is a symptom, not a cure, of the dilemma of knowing how to live.One more odd note: This film is an odd mirror-image of the Coen Brothers' tragicomic ""A Serious Man."" If you're skeptical of that comparison, think of the scenes in the two films when the central characters turn for advice to their official spiritual shepherds, one to his rabbi and one to his Episcopal priest. Neither rabbi nor priest has any reality of comfort to offer. Neither film is entirely successful, to my mind, but both are more interesting than just another action thriller.",5,William James Had This to Say....,1297728000,"02 15, 2011",2011,3857,"['Varieties', 'Religious', 'Experience', 'summarized', 'elsewhere', 'James', 'believed', 'study', 'origin', 'object', 'idea', 'not', 'play', 'role', 'study', 'value', 'asserted', 'existential', 'judgment', 'scientific', 'examination', 'object', 'origin', 'separate', 'matter', 'object', 'value', 'example', 'alluded', 'Quaker', 'religion', 'founder', 'George', 'Fox', 'Many', 'scientists', 'James', 'audience', 'immediately', 'reject', 'aspects', 'Quaker', 'religion', 'evidence', 'Fox', 'was', 'schizophrenic', 'Calling', 'rejection', 'medical', 'materialism', 'James', 'insisted', 'origin', 'Fox', 'notions', 'religion', 'should', 'not', 'come', 'account', 'when', 'propositioning', 'value', 'Quaker', 'religion', 'aside', 'many', 'believe', 'El', 'Greco', 'have', 'suffered', 'astigmatism', 'yet', 'one', 'would', 'dismiss', 'art', 'based', 'medical', 'detail', 'James', 'proposed', 'somewhat', 'sarcastically', 'audience', 'atheism', 'was', 'perhaps', 'dysfunction', 'liver', 'believe', 'science', 'be', 'superior', 'religion', 'religion', 'seemingly', 'vain', 'unfounded', 'perhaps', 'insane', 'origin', 'lectures', 'James', 'asserted', 'claims', 'perhaps', 'historically', 'epistemologically', 'interesting', 'play', 'role', 'separate', 'question', 'religion', 'value', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'watch', 'odd', 'film', 'William', 'James', 'ghost', 'precisely', 'question', 'religion', 'value', 'together', 'four', 'characters', 'convicted', 'murderer', 'Stone', 'seductive', 'wife', 'Lucetta', 'parole', 'officer', 'nearing', 'retirement', 'Jack', 'officer', 'wife', '43', 'years', 'two', 'women', 'represent', 'poles', 'religious', 'experience', 'young', 'wife', 'avowing', 'amoral', 'atheism', 'older', 'wife', 'clinging', 'fearfully', 'evangelical', 'Christianity', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'crisis', 'Stone', 'experiencing', 'charisma', 'Jack', 'floundering', 'collapsing', 'belief', 'not', 'only', 'God', 'credible', 'human', 'morality', 'William', 'James', 'addressed', 'thought', 'sources', 'belief', 'material', 'spiritual', 'film', 'different', 'polarity', 'are', 'two', 'basic', 'crises', 'religion', 'falling', 'belief', 'experienced', 'Jack', 'falling', 'belief', 'experienced', 'Stone', 'symmetry', 'experiences', 'core', 'film', 'almost', 'Zoroastrian', 'symmetry', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'regarded', 'turgid', 'failure', 'rigid', 'Virtue', 'Jack', 'wife', 'Sinfulness', 'Lucetta', 'karmic', 'redemption', 'Only', 'catharsis', 'can', 'yield', 'spiritual', 'change', 'better', 'worse.These', 'are', 'not', 'Values', 'let', 'hasten', 'declare', 'what', 'film', 'want', 'express', 'choose', 'watch', 'film', 'entertainment', 'gritty', 'engrossing', 'thriller', 'tale', 'passion', 'betrayal', 'corruption', 'billed', 'DVD', 'box', 'business', 'five-star', 'appreciation', 'related', 'earnest', 'attempt', 'portray', 'bizarre', 'religious', 'frenzies', 'mass', 'hysteria', 'America', 'be', 'caught', 'Great', 'Awakening', '.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'assorted', 'makers', 'film', 'were', 'control', 'film', 'messages', 'way', 'fact', ""'d"", 'guess', 'knew', 'not', 'what', 'wrought', 'most', 'viewers', 'who', 'opt', 'think', 'film', 'clear', 'message', 'religion', 'symptom', 'not', 'cure', 'dilemma', 'knowing', 'how', 'live.One', 'more', 'odd', 'note', 'film', 'odd', 'mirror-image', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'tragicomic', 'A', 'Serious', 'Man', ""'re"", 'skeptical', 'comparison', 'think', 'scenes', 'two', 'films', 'when', 'central', 'characters', 'turn', 'advice', 'official', 'spiritual', 'shepherds', 'one', 'rabbi', 'one', 'Episcopal', 'priest', 'rabbi', 'priest', 'reality', 'comfort', 'offer', 'film', 'entirely', 'successful', 'mind', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'just', 'action', 'thriller']",Stone

1388840,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0047T74CM,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","STONE is a complex film, perhaps too complex to create the impact that the story seems to be taking as writer Angus MacLaughlin and Director John  Curran seduce us into this study of manipulation, age versus youth, religion versus atheism versus spirituality, and crime in all its permutations.  That is a big load of topics for one film to handle but thanks to a quartet of fine actors the film works.Jack Mabry (Robert De Niro) is an aging parole officer at a prison who is finishing his career and preparing for retirement: being the seasoned lawman he is he requests to finish his current case load instead of passing it off to his replacement. Because of his success in his field he is asked to review the case of an arsonist called Stone (Edward Norton) who is up for early release.  Stone is a foul-mouthed, sassy, wily fellow who sees no importance to Jack except as a possible path to being released from prison.  The two men parlay and create boundaries that make the process seem unlikely - until Stone brings his amoral, promiscuous wife Lucetta (Milla Jonovich) into the plan. Jack has always been a monogamous husband to his evangelically oriented wife Madylyn (Frances Conroy - the film opens with a shocking scene from the early years of their marriage that sets the atmosphere for their strained family life - making the likelihood of Stone and Lucetta's  plan seem unlikely.Jack is certain that he will do a good job as a parole reviewer for Stone, but when Stone introduces the wiles of Lucetta much changes in the personality and philosophy of Jack.  And while this transformation into a pawn for a deceitful plan is working Stone appears to have a spiritual experience in jail - a confusing element for everyone in the film and in the audience.  How Jack is manipulated by Stone and Lucetta and the aftermath of Jack's input to the review board supplies the grit for the ending of the film with unexpected twists for all four characters.Edward Norton, complete with tattoos and corn rolled hair, gives us a character we cannot ignore or forget at movie's end.  He is astonishingly fine.  De Niro, Conroy and Jonovich are equally convincing in these complex and well-drawn roles.  This is a film that is at once cerebral and powerful.  The manner in which director Curran uses a near constant stream of radio evangelism as the background for this film is ingenious: the payoff is excellent.

Edward Norton and Milla Jovovich are two of my absolute favorite actors and Robert De Niro is excellent as well.  I picked it up without reading what it was about.  Tonight I sat down and watched it with my parents.  The opening was great.  De Niro's wife shows the typical signs of a victimized woman trying to leave and he immediatley holds their small, sleeping child outside their second story window, telling her ""I don't want to do it, but so help me if you leave me I will.""  She backs down and time is fastforwarded many years later, when they've been married over forty years.  This incident speaks a lot about both characters and there is much to be said about all four main charcters.  De Niro is the Parole Officer on Norton's case, Norton behind bars working hard trying to get out as he talks to De Niro each week, hoping for his approval when the time comes.  You can tell De Niro doesn't give it often or easily, and that Norton doesn't look so easily changed.  His beautiful wife, Jovovich, however, is determined to work her magic from the outside, though.  Working De Niro anyway she can for her husband's sake.  So as you can read, the actors or right, the acting and characterization is there, and the first half of the story shows much promise.  There is a lot of build up of redemption and forgiveness and much more.  But then it kind of falls flat.  The ending is anticlimatic and fizzles out.  I wouldn't want to spoil it too much but it was a disappointment for me and ruined the time I put into seeing it.  I was really invested in the first half and the people by then!  I wouldn't recommend it though, and thats saying a LOT for as big a Norton and Jovoich fan I am.

1388849,ABIVKBMSIPEDY,B0047T74CM,Kiyo M.,"[5, 6]","This is a film where the characters outperform the plot.It's definitely not for the masses, and it can be more appreciated over time after analyzing it, but certainly won't be if you view it as a ""popcorn flick"" going into it.This movie is NOT for you if:- you can't stand heavy-dialogue and slow pacing- expect to see a crime drama and see what clever way or twist on how they pulled it off (the film has to do more about hypocrisy/fate/religion and spirituality...or at least tries to be deep)- you hate abrupt endings that make you go ""Huh?""- you get offended about religious topics- you get offended seeing nudity and sex (Milla Jovovich is clearly topless a few times)- you expect to have a fun movie night with your friends/family (this is simply not that kind of thriller); if you expect action or edge-of-your-seat moments and twists after twists, this is NOT it. This is not anything powerful likeAmerican History XorThe Shawshank Redemption- you don't want to feel uncomfortable or low. There really is no real uplifting humor. No characters to really cheer for or like. Lots of arguing and depressing themes.This is a very unsettling dark film and I don't really mean that as a praise either. This is NOT a feel-good film; I don't mean just the tone and the theme, but the movie itself and the ending.If you watch the trailer for this movie, it gives the whole plot away. Seriously. (by the way, although the trailer makes it out to be this fast-paced thriller, it is definitely NOT. It's a very misleading trailer) If you're into the psychology of the characters, or trying to figure out what the director is trying to say, then there may still be some ""entertainment"" left for you to enjoy.The ending feels quite of a cop-out. It seems like the writers didn't know how to end it. I do get what they tried to do with the connection and the whole message about the bee and the noise, but I do feel cheated sitting through that whole film and not know what would happen to the characters next. It just leaves it too hanging and unsatisfying.It's a little ridiculous and hard to believe that De Niro, the parole officer, on his way to retirement - and a veteran - knowing fully well he should not be talking to the convict's wife in the first place, still involves himself with her in that manner. I wish the writers would have thought of something better because I think he gave in way too easily just so SOMETHING could finally happen in the film. (I mean, who would even trust eating a raw egg from a convict's wife?! What if that was poisoned?! Hello?)People will love it or hate this film. I think for the former to happen, you would have to really sit down and really listen to all the dialogue, and watch it more than once carefully. I think on an entertainment level, it fails. I think viewing it a second time and trying to think deeper about the psychology of the characters is where it may, or may not, get interesting; but that's more of what the audience will have to fill-in and not exactly what the movie itself will show to the audience clearly.It feels a little TV-drama to me with lots of talking heads back and forth in the office or prison. To me, it was a little distracting that the film used major stars because for some reason, I couldn't help watch the film the whole time without thinking I'm just watching De Niro and Norton on screen. I mean, De Niro was just De Niro. Edward Norton put some more effort into his character, but I still couldn't help it but see Stone's character as Edward Norton just acting. (When I was watching American History X, the story and dialogue was so engaging, I lost the Norton distraction and just saw that film of him as the character). I mean, it definitely does take a veteran cast to perform and sell those dialogues without coming out too cheesy or unbelievable.The extras on the DVD is really lousy. I'm surprised this DVD doesn't even have a director's commentary because it really could have used one, and I would have been interested to hear it.The first time I watched it, I hated the film. It grew on me the second time I watched it. Overall, I give it a 6/10. It's probably more interesting to analyze the theme or characters of this film than to watch the movie again. It is not your typical mindless Hollywood film, but at the same time, it's not a good source of ""entertainment"" either. It is a depressing film.Besides the performance, the main entertainment of this film is really in the dialogues. This movie is for you if you're into paying attention carefully to every dialogue and not so much on the plot; you'll notice subtle things like reoccurring lines like De Niro's character saying ""You don't think I'll do it"" in the beginning of the film when he's young (they sure found a good look alike!) and near the end.",3,Obvious plot -

Does that mean I didn't like this movie? No, I actually DID like it overall insomuch as it dealt with thought-provoking material in an entertaining way even though it left too much to the imagination for my tastes (too many missing details that remained undisclosed even after the final credits rolled making me wonder if a gag-order had been imposed on the answers to some of my questions after they were clicked into the forgotten oblivion of the editor's Trash Bin). I haven't encountered many movie references to reincarnation lately. This was one of the diverse beliefs creatively referenced more than once in this movie. But rather than preach that one belief is right and all others are wrong (the biggest problem with most modern-day religions that seek philosophical uniformity instead of spiritual unity), I did find it refreshing that various belief systems were dramatically conveyed without attaching any discriminating conclusions leaving audience members with the freedom to make up their own minds about what may or may not ring true (with or without the mystic chant of HU). As for myself, I just can't see God creating me in some past life as a fruitfly or a platypus or a pebble.

However, Angus MacLachlan's movie misses the mark of Junebug, and Edward Norton's character has none of the snap-your-spine intensity or believability in his similar role as a sociopath, Primal Fear. Milla Jovovich does her best in the role of Stone's wife Lucetta, whose seduction of De Niro's worldweary Mabry is simply mystifying, although Jovovich is captivating to watch. It stretches the limits of credibility that Mabry would jeopardize his retirement by having an affair with Stone's wife. For that matter, Stone's psychological head games seem difficult to swallow--why would he be trying to torment the man who has the power to release him from confinement? The only realistic role, with understandable motivations, belongs to Frances Conroy, who plays Mabry's wife. The opening scene shows that she is a neglected woman who managed to endure a quiet life with her husband, and is believably upset (in an understated way) about her husband's affair, to say nothing of the fact that De Niro does an excellent job at showing what a disaffected, emotionally numb, worldweary individual Mabry is.

It was only 105 minutes long, but it felt like hours.Robert DeNiro is cast as a parole officer who is about to retire.  Edward Norton is cast as the prisoner, a fast talking wise guy wearing his hair in corn rows.  He's been in prison for eight years on a sentence of arson.  He now wants out - badly. He then sets up his gorgeous wife, played by Milla Jovovich, to seduce DeNiro, whose own marriage with the alcoholic and religious Frances Conroy is clearly one of quiet desperation.  There is tension throughout the film and it's a cat and mouse game between the two men.  In the meantime, there is a secret in DeNiro's past which is hinted at in the beginning but which I had a hard time connecting to the story until the very end.This should have been a film that I got caught up in and wound up recommending to everyone.

He begins the film this way and continues on, searching for the meaning of life.Into Jack's world enters Stone (Norton), an arsonist convicted of torching his grandparent's house after being involved with their murder. Stone is set for release depending on the recommendation of Jack. The two have conversations in Jack's attempt to discover if Stone has been rehabilitated or not, if he possesses any sign of remorse. And in these few moments the best of the film is revealed.At first arrogant and obnoxious, Stone undergoes a series of events that bring about an epiphany in his soul. He begins to seek out religion and life and discover himself. But as he grows in his search Jack falters. Seeking out his own answers, Jack finds hollowness inside of himself that he can't seem to fill.While these conversations go on, Stone also attempts to play his ace in the hole by having his wife, Lucetta (Milla Jovovich) seduce Jack. The pair begin an affair slowly with Lucetta first approaching Jack to just discuss her husband's release and then slowly teasing him until he falls for her seduction. Just one more attempt and connecting with someone that Jack fails with.Whether or not Stone is eventually released is pretty much a given answer. But the question becomes is he the same man who went in or has he truly changed? Sadly this isn't the main focus of the film which is more on Jack and how the whole event affects him.All in all while it sounds like it might make an interesting film (and it probably did on paper) the movie is a let down. I didn't walk in expecting an action packed adventure. I didn't even expect a sexual thriller, though there is some bit of that included. I did expect a better story that didn't rely so much on distant, longing looks and drawn out still life visuals. Some directors seem to forget the term ""moving pictures"" means that films do indeed move. Many times this one just sits there.A number of critics and viewers have lauded the lead actors in this film, discussing the fact that they are among the greatest ever and that this film gives them ample opportunity to flex their acting muscles. The fact is that watching them rehearse scenes from other films would make for a more entertaining movie than this one.",2,AS INTERESTING AS WATCHING A STONE,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,2781,"['hate', 'when', 'take', 'phenomenal', 'actor', 'case', 'two', 'put', 'movie', 'supposed', 'feature', 'best', 'off', 'most', 'boring', 'waste', 'time', 'imaginable', 'Such', 'case', 'STONE', 'new', 'DVD', 'release', 'starring', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Edward', 'Norton.The', 'story', 'Jack', 'Mabry', 'DeNiro', 'parole', 'officer', 'large', 'prison', 'retire', 'Jack', 'been', 'detached', 'life', 'time', 'existence', 'merely', 'going', 'motions', 'feeling', 'little', 'anything', 'film', 'way', 'searching', 'meaning', 'life.Into', 'Jack', 'world', 'Stone', 'Norton', 'arsonist', 'convicted', 'torching', 'grandparent', 'house', 'being', 'involved', 'murder', 'Stone', 'set', 'release', 'depending', 'recommendation', 'Jack', 'two', 'have', 'conversations', 'Jack', 'attempt', 'discover', 'Stone', 'been', 'rehabilitated', 'not', 'sign', 'remorse', 'few', 'moments', 'best', 'film', 'revealed.At', 'first', 'arrogant', 'obnoxious', 'Stone', 'series', 'events', 'bring', 'epiphany', 'soul', 'seek', 'out', 'religion', 'life', 'discover', 'search', 'Jack', 'falters', 'Seeking', 'out', 'own', 'answers', 'Jack', 'hollowness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fill.While', 'conversations', 'go', 'Stone', 'also', 'play', 'ace', 'hole', 'having', 'wife', 'Lucetta', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'seduce', 'Jack', 'pair', 'begin', 'affair', 'slowly', 'Lucetta', 'first', 'approaching', 'Jack', 'just', 'discuss', 'husband', 'release', 'then', 'slowly', 'teasing', 'seduction', 'Just', 'one', 'more', 'attempt', 'connecting', 'someone', 'Jack', 'not', 'Stone', 'eventually', 'released', 'pretty', 'much', 'given', 'answer', 'question', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'went', 'truly', 'changed', 'Sadly', ""n't"", 'main', 'focus', 'film', 'more', 'Jack', 'how', 'whole', 'event', 'him.All', 'might', 'make', 'interesting', 'film', 'probably', 'did', 'paper', 'movie', 'let', 'down', 'did', ""n't"", 'walk', 'expecting', 'action', 'packed', 'adventure', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'expect', 'sexual', 'thriller', 'bit', 'included', 'did', 'expect', 'better', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'rely', 'so', 'much', 'distant', 'longing', 'looks', 'drawn', 'out', 'still', 'life', 'visuals', 'directors', 'seem', 'forget', 'term', 'moving', 'pictures', 'films', 'do', 'indeed', 'move', 'Many', 'times', 'one', 'just', 'there.A', 'number', 'critics', 'viewers', 'have', 'lauded', 'lead', 'actors', 'film', 'discussing', 'fact', 'are', 'greatest', 'ever', 'film', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'flex', 'acting', 'muscles', 'fact', 'watching', 'rehearse', 'scenes', 'other', 'films', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'one']",Stone

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[68, 81]","Robert DeNiro plays a parole officer about to retire and Edward Norton is cast as a convicted arsonist, trying to convince him that he should get an early release from prison in this gripping ""noirish"" thriller from director John Curran.Rather than ""convince,"" the wily Norton is, actually, trying to ""manipulate"" DeNiro into writing a favorable assessment.  He even goes so far as having his beautiful, off-the-wall wife (Milla Jovovich) seduce the corrections official in order to accomplish that.Though Angus McLachlan's screenplay sometimes tends to meander, it is populated with a quartet of fascinating multi-dimensional characters, none of which are particularly likable, yet all who are seeking some sort of spiritual enlightenment.DeNiro, in a loveless marriage (to Frances Conroy), finds that his church going cannot help him avoid his darker impulses, while Norton, after he witnesses a fellow prisoner being murdered, claims to have had a religious epiphany.  The operative word here is ""claims,"" because we're never quite sure if he's telling the truth or if this apparent change is simply a ruse to get what he wants.What makes STONE so compelling is its performances.  DeNiro, in one of the most complex roles he has had in years, plays a man fighting the evil within him, while Norton utilizes his unique talent to bring to life a chameleon-like sociopath.  Though she does not have a lot to do, Ms. Conroy is brilliant as the mostly silent, religious wife who has bargained away her life out of fear.Certainly Ms. Jovovich, cast as the bold, sexy wife who will stop at nothing to get what she wants, delivers the most colorful and surprising performance.  Part bimbo and part seductress, this is one of those women of film noir who would give Barbara Stanwyck's ""Phyllis Dietrichson"" (DOUBLE INDEMNITY) a run for her money.  And, it is also prime evidence that Ms. Jovovich is capable of doing material much more interesting than the RESIDENT EVIL franchise.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains a ""Making of"" featurette.

A convict's wife proceeds to seduce the parole officer who can get him out early but the real question is why is she doing it as she portrays herself as a loving, dutiful wife but is quickly revealed to be something much more.  What makes this tale interesting is its Eastern religious approach to why some people have horrible lives, focusing on the fact that many of us are reincarnated as lower life forms (i.e. stone, bug, animal, etc) and rarely do we get a human life in which some of us have to pay off the wrongs we did.  In some cases less bad people have to spend time with worse people.  The attempt at discussing reincarnation was done hit or miss but it was still interesting and a good attempt at a topic that normally is ignored by American films.  The convict, played by Norton, is arguably more enlightened spiritually than anyone else.  And what of the wife?  Social climber, temptress, alien or sensible wife?  De Niro is an extreme Calvinist type who believes his painful life has no direction and will only lead to more turmoil as reflected in his marriage.

1388864,A84FLVDK2R5JF,B0047T74CM,"Nathan M. Rose ""Movie Guy from FlickDirect""","[1, 3]","Stone is a film starring Edward Norton, Robert De Niro and Milla Jovovich, about a man who is nearing his parole hearing and attempts to manipulate the system so he is guaranteed freedom but along the way undergoes a spiritual epiphany.The film opens with a young couple who live a modest life somewhere in Midwest America. Right from the start anyone can tell that there is something missing from this family and that namely is joy. The husband sits still in his chair mindlessly watching a golf tournament on TV not bothering to notice anything his wife does or says. His wife, obviously miserable is coming to a realization about the life she is leading. In her attempt to signal to her husband that she wants out he makes a truly horrifying and desperate attempt to keep her from leaving and it works.Years later we see that same couple now in the twilight of their years. Jack Mabry, played by De Niro, is a parole officer who is on his way to retirement and only has a few months to go. He is in the final stages of wrapping up his case files but happens to start up with one last inmate, Gerald ""Stone"" Creeson, played by Edward Norton. Norton, who has over the years proven over the years that he is one of the most diverse actors of our generation, comes full force with his portrayal of this character. He delivers the dialogue with a low scratchy sound that you almost wonder if he was spending his off camera scenes shouting to achieve such an affect.As their interviews get under way you can tell that Mabry has seen and heard it all from the inmates over the years so he doesn't expect much from Gerald initially and like all inmates nearing their parole hearing Stone does his best to convince Mabry that he has reformed and should be allowed to integrate back into society. Once the film has established the relationship between these two people it begins to show the contrast in their lives as they go about their day. It's clear from the start that Stone, besides giving Mabry what he wants to hear, is willing to do whatever it takes to guarantee his parole, even so far as to enlist his wife. Stone's wife, Lucetta, played by Milla Jovovich, does a phenomenal job coming off as someone who clearly does what she wants when she wants.Things become even more complicated though when the hardship of prison life finally has a profound effect on Stone's mental state. Witnessing a prison murder causes Stone to begin to see the life around him in a new way. This causes complications with the plan he and his wife have enacted even though she is willing to follow it through to the end. She seduces Mabry and in doing so manipulates him into tweaking Stone's file so it when it goes before the review board he will be paroled. While this is what Stone initially wanted he now looks at his own life in a different light and with that comes new realizations about himself.The stands out performances here really are Jovovich and Norton. Norton, as always, is able to make a character convincing, scary, sad and somehow familiar all at the same time. Jovovich, who mainly has action films to her credit, shows more depth than what we're used to. She takes a simple character and adds a level of deviousness that is unexpected. De Niro on the other hand doesn't really bring much to his role, for the whole movie he just comes off as very uninterested or interesting which makes it difficult to watch as he plods along through each scene.Overall though his performance doesn't detract from the film on the whole; the only real drawback is the conclusion. You have to wonder if perhaps the writers had trouble coming up with a more rounded ending which is why they went with an open-ended one.

The reality is that very little happens in this film in the physical sense.

At least there'd be some damned chemistry."" Although without Fillion, this film does indeed have a brilliant cast. It's too bad the three main attractions (De Niro, Norton and Jovovich), however, show very little excitement in being their characters and all have dull, ""I just want my damn paycheck"" facial expressions. Mind you, they ARE great actors and I can't really expect the dull and jumbled script to have excited them to the point where they started caring about their characters.We have three characters here, all of which have very little relation whatsoever to each other and two of which have purpose. The only slightly interesting character is the title character, played by Edward Norton. De Niro plays a parole officer pushing retirement. One of his biggest cases is Stone, an arsonist convicted of torching his grandparents' house. Basically, Stone will only get out based on if De Niro's character recommends it.I'm not even sure why Jovovich's character was in there; she spends the whole film asking stupid questions and being a clueless idiot. It's especially a bad omen when she and De Niro were the only reason I had tuned in.There is character, and that's a good thing, but I like a little story with my characters, especially if you're going to amp the ""messed up"" level to 11. Whatever story there is, it doesnt have a shred of plausability of it. The film moves at an excruciatingly slow pace and its random inserts of nudity or awkward swearing are only notable because the rest of the film being so frakking slow, depressing, static and worst of all, boring.

I think the major problem I found with this movie is that it tries to cover plenty of ground and fails to deliver when the movie ends. Each of the three main characters have troubles of their own, but the character development, despite the excellent acting from De Niro and Norton, does not satisfy at all. I am not going to give away any spoilers but reading a pamphlet (the movie relies heavily on spiritual references)or witnessing a violent act can barely be considered as a major turn or conduct for an epiphany for a character as the one involved in these two cases. This psychological  thriller builds on many things towards the end but leaves whatever resolution ambiguous, when the movie ended my wife and I were ... well, surprised with the way it ends... surprised in a bad way...For those who may have seen it and want to own or perhaps those interested to watch it to form an opinion of their own, the DVD is presented in anamorphic widescreen 2.40:1, the video presentation is nothing that should stand out in Bluray so you may want to save a few dollars and get the DVD version instead; the only language option is English Dolby Digital 5.1 (the movie isn't really going to use your sound system that much anyways) and with English and Spanish subtitles. No special features other than the trailer and a making of documentary that lasts about 6 minutes. Trailer for other Anchor Bay titles are included.I knew when released this movie got a mixed reception but I wanted to give it a shot, my recommendation would be to try and rent it first.

We watch DeNiro lose control as he tries to deal with the relationship he develops with both Norton and Jovovich.

1388891,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B0047T74CM,Stephen M. Lerch,"[3, 6]","Disclaimer: I received this DVD for free through the Amazon Vine program. I review everything I receive through Vine as if I actually paid for it.This film is a bit odd to say the least. The story goes that Jack Mabry (DeNiro) is a parole officer who is pretty much just a shell of a man, living life from day to day and just going through the motions, with nothing tying it all together for him. For proof that he is disconnected from life one need only look at what he did with his daughter to keep his marriage intact. Still not sure how a woman wouldn't just grab the kid and leave one day while this guy is at work, but this is the movies and logic and common sense doesn't always make good film. And unfortunately neither does what they did with this movie.So Jack is near retirement and asks to keep his current inmates and make final decisions on those only. In comes Stone (Norton). Stone is a bit of an odd duck. He didn't assist in the murder of his grandparents, but he did set the house on fire which is why he's in jail. While serving his time, Stone has an epiphany and begins to feel the power of God flowing through him. Jack, being nothing more than a lifeless shell and believing in nothing, can't comprehend this new found love of God and instead chalks it up to a ploy to get out of jail.In order to get out of jail, Stone convinces his wife (Lucetta (Jovovich)) to seduce Jack which doesn't work... at first.The majority of the movie takes place in Jack's office and is almost completely dialog driven.I won't spoil the film for anyone actually wanting to watch it, but it's pretty obvious what Stone's fate will be but who remains ""sane"" in the end might surprise you. Or not, with how telegraphed and predictable it all really is.In regards to the film itself, it's boring. It's slow. It's overly long. It's a bit pretentious and preachy. I really do not like this movie at all.So how then, does it get 2 stars? The actors. DeNiro, Norton and Jovovich are, in a word, phenomenal and the only thing that could raise this from 1 star. Their characters are believable, well acted and well done. They hit every note perfectly. Despite having some amazing actors (and actress), the film disappoints in every other aspect. The script they were given is like handing dung to Picasso and expecting something great. You know that what he'll give you will be the best, most unique thing he can manage, but in the end it is still limited by the medium.I understand the concept of an art film is to make one think. Sure, one could pull all sorts of things from this film if they were so inclined. The problem is that most people won't be able to get past the horrid script and staid presentation. As one other reviewer here said, it's almost about as interesting as watching a stone.Now for the technical aspects of the DVD itself.Video:Very nicely encoded. No compression issues. No blocking. No blooming. No weird video anomalies at all. I suppose this is to be expected with 15 years of DVD (really, it's been around that long) experience under content providers' belts, this is as it should be.There is a lot of fine detail to be seen and on a good upscaling DVD player on an HDTV most people will likely not miss HD too much. It's nowhere near as sharp as HD, but for a DVD the amount of detail is nothing short of great.Audio:Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. Honestly though, considering the film is dialog driven, what's the point of 5.1 encoding other than a bullet point on the back of the box? There are no real surround effects and in all you could watch through your TV speakers and not miss anything. Music is pretty much nonexistent.The audio is well encoded and there are no issues. Again, 15 years of experience with a format helps.Extras:A single real extra is included on the disc. It's a rather paltry, disappointing 7 minute making of. Other than this extra, unless you count previews for other movies worth including in a discussion about extras, there isn't much here. And the making of really doesn't illuminate much about the film itself.Packaging:It comes with a nice cardboard slipcover. Why? I don't know. It's a copy of the cover and the back cover, so why did they decide to waste money on the slipcover? Maybe somewhere they were told by adding a slipcover they'd sell more copies? I don't know. The DVD case is pretty much standard, forgettable fare.In the end this is a very good DVD release of a horrid, boring and preachy film.With the actors involved you would most likely expect something much, much better than this. Norton as Stone is superb and almost unforgettable. Everything else, is quite forgettable.I was wondering why I was offered this DVD for free through Amazon. Surely, I thought, with the actors involved it had to have done well theatrically. It had a $22 million budget (not bad for an art film) and only pulled in $1.8 million domestically. Worldwide receipts show it pulled in a total of about $8.5 million. Perhaps they were thinking that if enough people on Amazon Vine enjoy the movie and rate it highly, DVD sales will soar. Based on my experience, this tactic should hopefully fail.Yes, I got it for free. Free, however, doesn't mean something is GOOD. And this film is not good at all.",2,Like Handing Dung to Picasso,1295913600,"01 25, 2011",2011,5250,"['Disclaimer', 'received', 'DVD', 'free', 'Amazon', 'Vine', 'program', 'review', 'everything',

So where do I begin? This is such a hard movie to review. While I love the main cast members of Robert De Niro, Edward Norton and Milla Jovovich; this film left me with an unhealthy mix of emotions including hatred, unsettlement, disappointment, and (darn it...) admiration.Robert De Niro plays the character of Jack Mabry, a parole officer on his 43rd year of marriage and rapidly approaching his retirement. Because of his actions, it didn't take long for me to completely despise this character. If that was the goal, De Niro should have a third Academy Award added to his list of accolades. I haven't hated a character De Niro portrayed this much since his role of Dwight Hansen in ""This Boy's Life"".Edward Norton depicts the title role of Gerald ""Stone"" Creeson. He's on his 8th year of a 10-15 stretch for accessory to murder and arson, and he needs Jack's help to convince the parole board to grant him an early release. This character was easier to like - mainly because Edward Norton is enjoyable to watch in pretty much every film I've ever seen him in. Stone goes through gradual changes throughout the movie and we see this through his dialogues with Jack and Lucetta.Rounding out our top three cast members is Milla Jovovich who plays Lucetta Creeson, Stoney's wife. Stone doesn't feel like he's making enough progress with Jack, so he begs Lucetta to convince Jack that he needs to be released. This is another character that I felt so much anger for as the film progressed. She starts out as a sweet school teacher with a heart of gold and soon we see her true colors: a manipulative, conniving, stalking sociopath.Our final key player is Frances Conroy who plays Madylyn, Jack's wife. She doesn't get a lot of screen time in this movie, which is regrettable, but the scripting didn't give her much more to do than look despondent and play the dutiful housewife. There's not much else to say about her.Each player in this production did their level best to show us people with some pretty horrific moral flaws, and this was done by some of the best actors in the business. Religion was the underlying theme behind everyone's changes, and their belief (or lack of) showed us what they could become - and we saw some VERY discomforting things.DVD EXTRAS:This is one bare-bones DVD. There is a ""Making of"" feature, but it clocks in at just over 6 minutes long. There are 2 movie trailers which run before the DVD main menu, and there are 4 more trailers under the ""Also on DVD"" section.FINAL THOUGHTS:In truth, I'm not sure how to feel about STONE. My initial reaction to this movie was one of disgust; because it was very dark and almost impossible to find a likeable character. I wanted to like it so badly!I watched this with my friend Fey and when the movie ended, she picked up the DVD case and said only three words: ""Gimme a lighter"".After thinking about it, I realized that Edward Norton was right - this movie was designed to unsettle the audience, and it succeeded at doing so. That's where my admiration comes from.However, just because a director knows how to unsettle his audience, doesn't mean he knows how to entertain them.",2,"""The intent of the film was to leave you feeling unsettled, unsure...those are the movies that tend to stay with people.""",1296345600,"01 30, 2011",2011,3274,"['title', 'review', 'quote', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'talking', 'movie', 'STONE', 'boy', 'oh', 'boy', 'was', 'So', 'where', 'do', 'begin', 'such', 'hard', 'movie', 'review', 'love', 'main', 'cast', 'members', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'film', 'left', 'unhealthy', 'mix', 'emotions', 'including', 'hatred', 'unsettlement', 'disappointment', 'darn', 'admiration.Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'character', 'Jack', 'Mabry', 'parole', 'officer', '43rd', 'year', 'marriage', 'rapidly', 'approaching', 'retirement', 'actions', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'completely', 'despise', 'character', 'was', 'goal', 'De', 'Niro', 'should', 'have', 'third', 'Academy', 'Award', 'added', 'list', 'accolades', 'have', ""n't"", 'hated', 'character', 'De', 'Niro', 'portrayed', 'much', 'role', 'Dwight', 'Hansen', 'Boy', 'Life', '.Edward', 'Norton', 'title', 'role', 'Gerald', 'Stone', 'Creeson', '8th', 'year', '10-15', 'stretch', 'accessory', 'murder', 'arson', 'Jack', 'help', 'convince', 'parole', 'board', 'grant', 'early', 'release', 'character', 'was', 'easier', 'like', 'mainly', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'pretty', 'much', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Stone', 'gradual', 'changes', 'movie', 'see', 'dialogues', 'Jack', 'Lucetta.Rounding', 'out', 'top', 'three', 'cast', 'members', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'who', 'Lucetta', 'Creeson', 'Stoney', 'wife', 'Stone', ""n't"", 'feel', 'making', 'enough', 'progress', 'Jack', 'Lucetta', 'convince', 'Jack', 'be', 'released', 'character', 'felt', 'so', 'much', 'anger', 'film', 'progressed', 'out', 'sweet', 'school', 'teacher', 'heart', 'gold', 'soon', 'see', 'true', 'colors', 'manipulative', 'conniving', 'stalking', 'sociopath.Our', 'final', 'key', 'player', 'Frances', 'Conroy', 'who', 'Madylyn', 'Jack', 'wife', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'movie', 'regrettable', 'scripting', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'more', 'do', 'look', 'despondent', 'play', 'dutiful', 'housewife', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'say', 'her.Each', 'player', 'production', 'did', 'level', 'best', 'show', 'people', 'pretty', 'horrific', 'moral', 'flaws', 'was', 'done', 'best', 'actors', 'business', 'Religion', 'was', 'underlying', 'theme', 'everyone', 'changes', 'belief', 'lack', 'showed', 'what', 'could', 'become', 'saw', 'VERY', 'discomforting', 'things.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'one', 'bare-bones', 'DVD', 'Making', 'feature', 'just', '6', 'minutes', 'long', 'are', '2', 'movie', 'trailers', 'run', 'DVD', 'main', 'menu', 'are', '4', 'more', 'trailers', 'Also', 'DVD', 'section.FINAL', 'THOUGHTS', 'truth', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'feel', 'STONE', 'initial', 'reaction', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'disgust', 'was', 'very', 'dark', 'almost', 'impossible', 'find', 'likeable', 'character', 'wanted', 'like', 'so', 'badly', 'watched', 'friend', 'Fey', 'when', 'movie', 'ended', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'case', 'said', 'only', 'three', 'words', 'Gim', 'lighter', '.After', 'thinking', 'realized', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'was', 'right', 'movie', 'was', 'designed', 'unsettle', 'audience', 'succeeded', 'doing', 'so', 'where', 'admiration', 'from.However', 'just', 'director', 'how', 'unsettle', 'audience', ""n't"", 'mean', 'how', 'entertain']",Stone

I will warn you, the opening scene of the movie is a tad distrubing, but is needed to understand the characters.  Jack is a pretty routine guy and wants to handle the ""Stone"" situation before leaving.  Trying to convince Jack he is a changed man, but not willing to risk being turned down, he asks his wife, Lucetta, to talk to Jack and convince him that he should be free.  I've heard actors talk about ""character arcs"" before, but never understood what they meant by one until this movie.  Much like ""Jack goes boating"" this movie is better then it is because of the acting.  De Niro and Norton you know what your gonna get, but Jovovich breaks out of her ""Resident Evil Bad-Ass"" role in a big way and holds her own against these two.  I really like movies that make you thing about them when they are done, this is one of them.  There are no loose-end tie ups, and like ""Inception"" you are left to draw your own conclusions.

Pama ""Yogesh""","[7, 9]","But for the lure of the remarkably under-valued Edward Norton, I almost missed this most interesting and thought provoking film, due to the mostly negative or apathetic reviews that it received.Personally I find these views hard to understand.The performances by the lead actors alone are worth the price.  After several recent lack-lustre performances, DeNiro has never been better and Norton's performance is just amazing.  And then there's Milla Jovovich, who rises easily and capably to the occasion as she spars with the heavyweights.  At the same time please do not ignore, as others appear to have done, the lovely Frances Conroy's finely tuned performance.The script itself delves extremely intelligently into areas of sexuality and religion, without pandering for one moment to cheap sensationalism or judgemental preaching.  If anything, it deals with the subject of personal responsibility in an enlightened and novel fashion as it deliberately steers clear of moralising and blame. In considering the depths of the human pschyche that are being explored here, the excellent series ""Inserts"", (first season) comes to mind and fans thereof should take note.Yogesh",5,"Not for the masses, but not to be missed by serious film buffs",1301443200,"03 30, 2011",2011,1173,"['lure', 'remarkably', 'under-valued', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'almost', 'missed', 'most', 'interesting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'due', 'mostly', 'negative', 'apathetic', 'reviews', 'received.Personally', 'find', 'views', 'hard', 'understand.The', 'performances', 'lead', 'actors', 'alone', 'are', 'worth', 'price', 'several', 'recent', 'lack-lustre', 'performances', 'DeNiro', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'Norton', 'performance', 'just', 'amazing', 'then', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'who', 'easily', 'capably', 'occasion', 'heavyweights', 'same', 'time', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'ignore', 'others', 'appear', 'have', 'done', 'lovely', 'Frances', 'Conroy', 'finely', 'tuned', 'performance.The', 'script', 'extremely', 'intelligently', 'areas', 'sexuality', 'religion', 'pandering', 'one', 'moment', 'cheap', 'sensationalism', 'judgemental', 'preaching', 'anything', 'subject', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'enlightened', 'novel', 'fashion', 'steers', 'clear', 'moralising', 'blame', 'considering', 'depths', 'human', 'pschyche', 'are', 'being', 'explored', 'here', 'excellent', 'series', 'Inserts', 'first', 'season', 'mind', 'fans', 'thereof', 'should', 'take', 'note.Yogesh']",Stone
