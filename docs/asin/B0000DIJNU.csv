There is depth of emotion without sentiment, spiritual exploration without cliche and human truth devoid of lecturing.  In addition, this writer and director were truly fortunate in their cast.

778878,ASIEGG17K1UID,B0000DIJNU,"Ex-Buyer ""Thomas""","[0, 0]","There is no doubt that from the very start of this movie you know how it will end.  Not only will you know how it will end, but you can just state out loud what the next stereo-typical plot twist or deviation will be and whom is who's brother or sister or father. Who will die a horrible death, etc.  It is so ""hallmark/Lifetime"" in its predictability that it borders on sappy. The acting leaves less than can be desired. All three main characters try hard, very hard, to get through this script as best they can. Sutherland trying to play bitchy and somewhat effeminate gay man is painful to watch. The script for Channing is almost beneath her talents and she too is painful to watch..and Sedgewick is just painful.  So why did I give this four stars? The cinematography is breath taking. Not just the locale, but the pristine sharp focus of the lens and the the somber setting makes you become part of the movie. I have never watched any film where I truly felt I was there, I was in the scene and not because of the emotions pouring from the actors, there is no emoting, it is clearly the cinematography.  The colors of autumn, even in summer, are pronounced and vibrant..this feel/look follows the film from start to the very end. The first time I viewed it on Showtime I was taken back by the photography...it was only later upon watching it a second time did I realize just how awful and predictable was the story line.",4,Another Predictable Plot...But Worth it.,1370476800,"06 6, 2013",2013,1426,"['doubt', 'very', 'start', 'movie', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'Not', 'only', 'will', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'can', 'just', 'state', 'out', 'loud', 'what', 'next', 'stereo-typical', 'plot', 'twist', 'deviation', 'will', 'be', 'whom', 'who', 'brother', 'sister', 'father', 'Who', 'will', 'die', 'horrible', 'death', 'etc', 'so', 'hallmark/Lifetime', 'predictability', 'sappy', 'acting', 'less', 'can', 'be', 'desired', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'try', 'hard', 'very', 'hard', 'get', 'script', 'can', 'Sutherland', 'trying', 'play', 'bitchy', 'somewhat', 'effeminate', 'gay', 'man', 'painful', 'watch', 'script', 'Channing', 'almost', 'talents', 'too', 'painful', 'watch..and', 'Sedgewick', 'just', 'painful', 'So', 'why', 'did', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'cinematography', 'breath', 'taking', 'Not', 'just', 'locale', 'pristine', 'sharp', 'focus', 'lens', 'somber', 'setting', 'become', 'part', 'movie', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'film', 'where', 'truly', 'felt', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'scene', 'not', 'emotions', 'pouring', 'actors', 'emoting', 'clearly', 'cinematography', 'colors', 'autumn', 'even', 'summer', 'are', 'pronounced', 'vibrant..this', 'feel/look', 'film', 'start', 'very', 'end', 'first', 'time', 'viewed', 'Showtime', 'was', 'taken', 'back', 'photography', 'was', 'only', 'later', 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'did', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'awful', 'predictable', 'was', 'story', 'line']",Behind The Red Door

778880,AFOMUP8ZUAFV3,B0000DIJNU,Jill,"[13, 13]","This movie absolutely took me by surprise.  I wasn't expecting much as I have seen some of Kiefer Sutherland's earlier movies and wasn't impressed at all by the story content or his acting.  With that said.... I have to say I was absolutely stunned at the power of his portrayal of Roy Hadad.  I found myself forgetting that it was Kiefer playing a role, but instead found myself empathizing with Roy and taking great joy in the relationship he was beginning to re-form with his sister Natalie on an adult level.  I could truly feel Roy's vulnerabilities and fears through Kiefer's interpretation of him.  I also am not ashamed to admit that I rented this movie multiple times before I bought it.  The only thing that mars the beauty of this story is the use of a very strong curse word used multiple times by different actors.  I wish it wasn't there and it really serves no purpose being there.  It truly detracts from the pure beauty of the film.  The serenity of the ocean coupled with Kiefer's very subtle facial expressions and movements when he makes his decision on the deck and when he tells Natalie of this decision (I won't ruin it for those who have not seen it) overwhelmed me.  I truly felt the power of his conviction and the sense of purpose Roy must have felt at that time, and this was once again all due to Kiefer's portrayal of Roy.  Kiefer also portrays Roy's lifestyle in a way that is understated so that this is not the focus of the film but keeps the focus on the relationships and Roy finding for himself peace with God and others.  This movie is pure genius on the part of Kiefer Sutherland and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a movie with depth.  I look forward to more truly amazing performances by Kiefer Sutherland in the future.  Kiefer, if you're out there let me say that no actor has ever moved me the way you did in this movie.

778881,A3IM77LLZAN8B6,B0000DIJNU,J. W. Hickey,"[1, 8]","Pauline Kael famously barbed that she might have been able to conjure empathethic tears for Bette Davis in DARK VICTORY if it weren't for the fact that the terminally ill Judith so nobly surrendered up such a posh-elegant life in such a posh-elegant setting.  In kind, the terminally ill protagonist of BEHIND THE RED DOOR collapses in a bathroom the size of an enviably vast studio apartment--posh-elgant gold faucets and all.  If ya gotta go, then die young, pretty, and rich.The positive components of this movie are the cinematography of beautiful landscapes on diamond-sharp film stock, Kiefer Sutherland channeling his real-life father's best acting tics, and ... well, that's about it.Stockard Channing looks young and attractive and not over-the-top brassy in the Audrey Meadows/ Eve Arden role of tough best friend, and the rest of a capable cast at times raise their paper-thin characters to two-dimensionality.But the negatives include a self-serving screenplay, a muddled Daddy Dearest subplot that spins its wheels in redundant but non-advancing flashbacks and is not adequately resolved, and a heroine continually playing second banana to her own Medusan hairdo--the worst cocker spaniel coif since Daryl Hannah's flat curls in the drab remake of REAR WINDOW.""No one really wants to be alone,"" a dying man intones somberly, though it's likely that ANYONE would prefer dying alone rather than be subjected to the nearly psychotic, solipsistic drivel this poor soul must endure in the climactic deathbed scene.A major flaw in the script misses what might have been a moment of genuine interest.  When the heroine is splashed with contaminated blood, she assures the doctor that she's safe because she has no open cuts.  But in the first scene of the movie she stabs her own finger at the mere hint of her brother's existence.  The self-stabbing was intended only as a a ""visual"" externalization, a disturbed sibling's metaphor rather than an actual aspect of a sustained character over the arc of a coherent plot.  Convenient for the exposition but too complicated for the film's ""third act,"" so we're expected to accept the sister's short-term lapse of memory:  this is the kind of pretty-suffering movie where an audience's short-term memory is expected, demanded, and a blessing.Sutherland plays ""Roy,"" a man of limitless wealth, whose sister's principles keep her poor but pure.  By movie's end, as each breath brings him closer toward death, Roy morphs from egotistical tyrant into a beatified saint spouting sputums of precious wisdom, while the script transforms Sis into self-satisfied Rod McKuen greeting card.  Should we be surprised to learn that the film was produced, written, and directed by a woman whose now deceased brother's name was ... Roy?Evidently the real-life Roy bequeathed his real-life limitless wealth to his real-life sister, enabling her to make this visually stunning but egocentricly shallow fortune cookie of a movie.Real-life Roy's real-life sister was so real-life wealthy and nobly grieving, it appears, that she defied anyone else associated with the production to cool her jets and make the tribute to her brother she hoped but failed to achieve.",1,hallmark/ lifetime illness-of-the-week schlock,1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,3196,"['Pauline', 'Kael', 'famously', 'barbed', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'conjure', 'empathethic', 'tears', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'DARK', 'VICTORY', 'were', ""n't"", 'fact', 'terminally', 'ill', 'Judith', 'so', 'nobly', 'surrendered', 'up', 'such', 'posh-elegant', 'life', 'such', 'posh-elegant', 'setting', 'kind', 'terminally', 'ill', 'protagonist', 'BEHIND', 'THE', 'RED', 'DOOR', 'bathroom', 'size', 'enviably', 'vast', 'studio', 'apartment', 'posh-elgant', 'gold', 'faucets', 'ya', 'got', 'ta', 'go', 'then', 'die', 'young', 'pretty', 'rich.The', 'positive', 'components', 'movie', 'are', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'landscapes', 'diamond-sharp', 'film', 'stock', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'channeling', 'real-life', 'father', 'best', 'acting', 'tics', 'well', 'about', 'it.Stockard', 'Channing', 'young', 'attractive', 'not', 'over-the-top', 'brassy', 'Audrey', 'Meadows/', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'role', 'tough', 'best', 'friend', 'rest', 'capable', 'cast', 'times', 'raise', 'paper-thin', 'characters', 'two-dimensionality.But', 'negatives', 'include', 'self-serving', 'screenplay', 'muddled', 'Daddy', 'Dearest', 'subplot', 'wheels', 'redundant', 'non-advancing', 'flashbacks', 'not', 'adequately', 'resolved', 'heroine', 'continually', 'playing', 'second', 'banana', 'own', 'Medusan', 'hairdo', 'worst', 'cocker', 'spaniel', 'coif', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'flat', 'curls', 'drab', 'remake', 'REAR', 'WINDOW', 'one', 'really', 'be', 'alone', 'dying', 'man', 'intones', 'somberly', 'likely', 'ANYONE', 'would', 'prefer', 'dying', 'alone', 'rather', 'be', 'subjected', 'nearly', 'psychotic', 'solipsistic', 'drivel', 'poor', 'soul', 'must', 'endure', 'climactic', 'deathbed', 'scene.A', 'major', 'flaw', 'script', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'moment', 'genuine', 'interest', 'When', 'heroine', 'splashed', 'contaminated', 'blood', 'doctor', 'safe', 'open', 'cuts', 'first', 'scene', 'movie', 'stabs', 'own', 'finger', 'mere', 'hint', 'brother', 'existence', 'self-stabbing', 'was', 'intended', 'only', 'visual', 'externalization', 'disturbed', 'sibling', 'metaphor', 'rather', 'actual', 'aspect', 'sustained', 'character', 'arc', 'coherent', 'plot', 'Convenient', 'exposition', 'too', 'complicated', 'film', 'third', 'act', ""'re"", 'expected', 'accept', 'sister', 'short-term', 'lapse', 'memory', 'kind', 'pretty-suffering', 'movie', 'where', 'audience', 'short-term', 'memory', 'expected', 'demanded', 'blessing.Sutherland', 'Roy', 'man', 'limitless', 'wealth', 'sister', 'principles', 'keep', 'poor', 'pure', 'movie', 'end', 'breath', 'closer', 'death', 'Roy', 'morphs', 'egotistical', 'tyrant', 'beatified', 'saint', 'spouting', 'sputums', 'precious', 'wisdom', 'script', 'Sis', 'self-satisfied', 'Rod', 'McKuen', 'greeting', 'card', 'Should', 'be', 'surprised', 'learn', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'written', 'directed', 'woman', 'now', 'brother', 'name', 'was', 'Roy', 'Evidently', 'real-life', 'Roy', 'bequeathed', 'real-life', 'limitless', 'wealth', 'real-life', 'sister', 'enabling', 'make', 'visually', 'stunning', 'egocentricly', 'shallow', 'fortune', 'cookie', 'movie.Real-life', 'Roy', 'real-life', 'sister', 'was', 'so', 'real-life', 'wealthy', 'nobly', 'grieving', 'defied', 'anyone', 'else', 'associated', 'production', 'cool', 'jets', 'make', 'tribute', 'brother', 'hoped', 'failed', 'achieve']",Behind The Red Door

I commend Showtime for producing character-driven, grown-up movies like this, and Behind the Red Door was no disappointment.  I really love it when an actor completely defies an iconic role the way Kiefer Sutherland does in this movie.  Others have mentioned his subtle expressions, but what struck me was the clipped, almost affected way of speaking - just one of the many barriers this character put up between himself and the world.  I found myself rewinding to replay some of his sarcastic, wry remarks.  I had not seen Kyra Sedgwick in too many things (not a fan of The Closer), so I had no preconceptions about her.  Her character was so multilayered and real, and her struggle to understand what happened to her mother was like an open wound.  I loved her reactions, especially her temper tantrum outside after being attacked for her bad cooking.I think a previous reviewer completely missed the point about the mother's death.  It was not about resolving a murder mystery (as a lesser film might have attempted), but about Natalie's coming to grips with the event.  Her comment to Roy, which I won't spoil here, about ""knowing,"" and his agreement, summed that up nicely.I loved that the film wasn't preachy about AIDS or about being gay.  It was just this beautiful story about how life gets stripped down to the things that really matter, and all pretenses and masks fall away, when you know you only have so much time to put things in order.  It wasn't sentimental or sappy or contrived or cliched.  I felt like I knew these characters by the end of the film, and I had grown to like them as well.

For his next project Roy, acid-tongued perfectionist, hires a photographer Natalie (Kyra Sedgwick), who happens to be his long estranged sister. We soon realize that Roy actually called in his sister for another reason - he knows he is sick.""Behind the Red Door"" tells the story of their reconciliation as well as their traumatic childhood in the film's black-and-white flashback sequences. Stockard Channing also appears as Natalie's agent, but the time and role allotted to her is too short and small.Kiefer Sutherland superbly deals with the vulnerable side of cynical Roy, who must accept the inevitable facts. Kyra Sedgwick is also very good as his sister, who cannot leave her annoying brother even after displaying her animosities right in front of him. Each scene including both actors has a ring of truth, something that many people would find in their personal experiences.However, I for one found the flashbacks about the murder of their mother unnecessary. The saddest event that must have affected the lives of the children needs more detailed descriptions, but the back story about the death of their mother remains too vague to convince us of the impact upon Roy and Natalie, whose memories, it is suggested still haunt her present life.The dramatic power of ""Behind the Red Door"" comes largely from the talented stars whose effective acting makes the otherwise ordinary film's scenes very memorable.",3,Benefits From the Superb Acting from Sutherland and Sedgwick,1176422400,"04 13, 2007",2007,1541,"['Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'credible', 'acting', 'Roy', 'rich', 'successful', 'businessman', 'reason', 'should', 'see', 'little-known', 'film', 'next', 'project', 'Roy', 'acid-tongued', 'perfectionist', 'photographer', 'Natalie', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'who', 'be', 'long', 'estranged', 'sister', 'soon', 'realize', 'Roy', 'actually', 'called', 'sister', 'reason', 'sick', 'Red', 'Door', 'story', 'reconciliation', 'as', 'well', 'traumatic', 'childhood', 'film', 'black-and-white', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'also', 'Natalie', 'agent', 'time', 'role', 'allotted', 'too', 'short', 'small.Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'superbly', 'deals', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'cynical', 'Roy', 'who', 'must', 'accept', 'inevitable', 'facts', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'sister', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'annoying', 'brother', 'even', 'displaying', 'animosities', 'right', 'front', 'scene', 'including', 'actors', 'ring', 'truth', 'something', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'find', 'personal', 'experiences.However', 'one', 'found', 'flashbacks', 'murder', 'mother', 'unnecessary', 'saddest', 'event', 'must', 'have', 'affected', 'lives', 'children', 'more', 'detailed', 'descriptions', 'back', 'story', 'death', 'mother', 'too', 'vague', 'convince', 'impact', 'Roy', 'Natalie', 'memories', 'suggested', 'still', 'haunt', 'present', 'life.The', 'dramatic', 'power', 'Red', 'Door', 'largely', 'talented', 'stars', 'effective', 'acting', 'otherwise', 'ordinary', 'film', 'scenes', 'very', 'memorable']",Behind The Red Door
