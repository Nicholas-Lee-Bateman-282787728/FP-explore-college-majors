1082344,AJOF6MLUKKLFZ,B000RL5H6Y,Adam,"[0, 0]","The third series of the New Who followed the success of the first two seasons which set high expectations. This is tough to judge but overall, I felt that Series 3 wasn't quite as good as Series 2, but still quite excellent.It wasn't Martha Jones per se. I think she was a good companion. Freema Agyeman played Martha as a very solid competent companion who, as many companions in the past have done, saved the world at the end of the day. She was compassionate, courageous, and pretty fun from the beginning particularly in the first few episodes. What didn't work for me was her pining for the Doctor. It came off, at times, as pathetic. For a longer series, you can work in a little bit of it in several episodes. But the fact that her whole run her is thirteen episodes and the Doctor never shows any interest, hurts an overall pretty strong character.Outside of the awful two part Dalek Story, the writing on the show was always solid. The series hit high marks in Martha's Introduction story, &#34;Smith and Jones&#34; and &#34;Blink.&#34;  The rest of the stand-alone stories were  good solid entertainment even if they didn't hit that high water mark.  The two part &#34;Human Nature/Family of Blood&#34; story had some good moments and was well-acted despite some head scratching portions.  The three part season finale featured two great cliffhangers and some great twists particularly in the episode, &#34;Utopia.&#34; The final two parts were often puzzling but ended in a thought provoking way.All the multi-part episodes this season focused on the character of the Doctor. In his very first episode, the Tenth Doctor was clear that he'd give his enemies one chance, but if they failed to take advantage of it, there would be a price to pay. We saw to what extent he would go to extend mercy to his enemies in the Dalek story, in the Family of Blood, and in the last two episodes. We also saw how fiercely he could meat out wrath in, &#34;Runaway Bride&#34; and in the same Family of Blood story.We also see the Doctor as a war-weary man who wants to make peace with his enemies: with the last remnants of the Daleks and with the Master.Tennant carries these more somber moments off well, while still managing to play the Doctor's more manic excited scenes as well, though these are far less prevalent than in Series 2 as the loss of Rose made the doctor a more somber character.So in conclusion, this was a good series but not as enjoyable for me as the preceding seasons.",4,"Blink, a New Companion, and Evolution of the Daleks",1398470400,"04 26, 2014",2014,2486,"['third', 'series', 'New', 'Who', 'followed', 'success', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'set', 'high', 'expectations', 'tough', 'judge', 'overall', 'felt', 'Series', '3', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Series', '2', 'still', 'quite', 'excellent.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'Martha', 'Jones', 'se', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'companion', 'Freema', 'Agyeman', 'played', 'Martha', 'very', 'solid', 'competent', 'companion', 'who', 'many', 'companions', 'past', 'have', 'done', 'saved', 'world', 'end', 'day', 'was', 'compassionate', 'courageous', 'pretty', 'fun', 'beginning', 'particularly', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'pining', 'Doctor', 'came', 'off', 'times', 'pathetic', 'longer', 'series', 'can', 'work', 'little', 'bit', 'several', 'episodes', 'fact', 'whole', 'run', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'Doctor', 'never', 'interest', 'overall', 'pretty', 'strong', 'character.Outside', 'awful', 'two', 'part', 'Dalek', 'Story', 'writing', 'show', 'was', 'always', 'solid', 'series', 'hit', 'high', 'marks', 'Martha', 'Introduction', 'story', '34', 'Smith', 'Jones', '34', '34', 'Blink.', '34', 'rest', 'stand-alone', 'stories', 'were', 'good', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'high', 'water', 'mark', 'two', 'part', '34', 'Human', 'Nature/Family', 'Blood', '34', 'story', 'had', 'good', 'moments', 'was', 'well-acted', 'head', 'scratching', 'portions', 'three', 'part', 'season', 'finale', 'featured', 'two', 'great', 'cliffhangers', 'great', 'twists', 'particularly', 'episode', '34', 'Utopia.', '34', 'final', 'two', 'parts', 'were', 'often', 'puzzling', 'ended', 'thought', 'provoking', 'multi-part', 'episodes', 'season', 'focused', 'character', 'Doctor', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'Tenth', 'Doctor', 'was', 'clear', ""'d"", 'give', 'enemies', 'one', 'chance', 'failed', 'take', 'advantage', 'would', 'be', 'price', 'pay', 'saw', 'what', 'extent', 'would', 'go', 'extend', 'mercy', 'enemies', 'Dalek', 'story', 'Family', 'Blood', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'also', 'saw', 'how', 'fiercely', 'could', 'meat', 'out', 'wrath', '34', 'Runaway', 'Bride', '34', 'same', 'Family', 'Blood', 'story.We', 'also', 'see', 'Doctor', 'war-weary', 'man', 'who', 'make', 'peace', 'enemies', 'last', 'remnants', 'Daleks', 'Master.Tennant', 'more', 'somber', 'moments', 'off', 'well', 'still', 'managing', 'play', 'Doctor', 'more', 'manic', 'excited', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'far', 'less', 'prevalent', 'Series', '2', 'loss', 'Rose', 'made', 'doctor', 'more', 'somber', 'character.So', 'conclusion', 'was', 'good', 'series', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'preceding', 'seasons']",N/A

You totally &#34;get&#34; the dynamic of the relationship between Rose and the Doctor. His regeneration is so well done and each episode is just fabulous.Then comes Season 3. We're still shattered from the Doctor and Rose losing each other when Martha Jones appears. During the entire season I found her to be difficult to watch. Her emotive reactions are not always plausible and her insipid pining for the Doctor is annoying. The story lines were okay, but things were sort of dampened by Martha's screechy reactions.

My children and I thrilled to some amazing episodes, and even the weaker episodes are better than most television being broadcast today.  In fact, the only disappointment is that the season had to end, and that it will be so long until season 4 starts up again.Martha Jones was a wonderful companion; just the antidote needed after Rose departed in last season's tearful finale.  She's smart and funny, a doctor (in a nice bit of symmetry) and in love with the Doctor.  Unrequited though it may be, through her eyes we see him as a man worth spending time with, for all he ignores her crush.  It also give us a chance to say goodbye to Rose as the Doctor comes to grip with his loss.The superlative episodes mentioned by so many (Blink, Human Nature, The Sound of Drums) are not to be missed.  In the two week period I saw Human Nature and Blink, I believe I witnessed two of television's finest hours.  The three-part season finale was exceptional, though the third episode was weaker than the second, which was in turn weaker than the second, for all that I love the sublime John Simm.

He's funny, brilliant with verbal wit and physical comedy, and conveys the Doctor's intelligence, enthusiasm, and occasional dark side quite well. Freema Agyeman, as Martha, is a solid choice as his companion, despite being a little too love-struck with the Doctor.

1082380,A11GO5VA74HD8K,B000RL5H6Y,Crazy Fox,"[57, 59]","Third time's a charm--that's the inevitable cliche that pops to mind. If the first series (season) of Doctor Who was good with some hiccups and the second quite fine overall, the show's creators seem to have really hit their stride with the third series here and brought forth an excellent range of science fiction adventures at once interesting, inventive, and exciting--innovative and unusual but very true to the show's spirit over the decades. Oh, and loads of fun, of course.By now David Tennant has a totally surefire grasp of the Doctor's character and has contributed much to its portrayal--and convincingly developed it in the bargain, especially in light of the events of series two. Eccentric as always, frenetic and off the wall but silently nursing a deep melancholy, open and friendly and yet with a certain emotional distance and brusqueness. The Doctor we all know and love, but a little more complex. You will never get me to say that he's better than Tom Baker as some have, but my sense is that Tennant may very well end up putting as definitive a stamp on the renegade Time Lord for this generation as Baker did for us old-timers. As for the Doctor's companion, it's clear that the writers were wisely avoiding a repeat of Rose (whom we all miss, yes) and going instead for a somewhat more mature and intelligent foil in up-and-coming med student Martha (as played by Freema Agyeman)--a doctor in training, as it were, a bit of cleverness that the writers thankfully capitalize on in her first episode. The chemistry strains a bit to spark at first and the one-sided romance angle is brought in a bit too abruptly perhaps, but still The Doctor and Martha make a nice, believable team overall.The storytelling for this series is excellence itself. Not perfection, mind you, which is humanly impossible anyway, but even the lesser episodes are better than most of what you'll find on TV nowadays--especially when it comes to sci-fi. ""The Runaway Bride"" is good if slightly twisted holiday fun in the way a Christmas special should be, ""Smith and Jones"" has a hint of Douglas Adams influence in its satirically-edged motifs of galactic bureaucracies and absurd situations, ""The Shakespeare Code"" is a highly memorable pseudo-historical starring the Bard himself in a manner totally cohesive with the plot, and ""Gridlock"" is a claustrophobic return to New New York with an edgier angle. The ""Daleks in Manhattan""/""Evolution of the Daleks"" two-parter is kind of like comfort food for older Doctor Who fans--a very typical Dalek tale of invasion and mutation, but with a few fresh ingredients like the human/dalek hybrid and the 1930's New York setting. ""The Lazarus Experiment"" and ""42"" likewise conform to tried-and-true Doctor Who formulas but successfully so, ""42"" being something of an cocktail mix of ""Ark in Space"" and ""Inferno"" complete with a not overplayed ecological theme.On the other hand, ""Human Nature""/""The Family of Blood"" and ""Blink"" are unlike anything ever before seen really in Doctor Who and really showcase the creativity and never-ending potential of the show. And then finally the three-part epic series conclusion, ""Utopia""/""The Sound of Drums""/""The Last of the Time Lords"" first takes the Doctor to the Big Crunch and then builds on countless clues scattered throughout all the season's prior episodes to expertly spring quite a surprise on the unsuspecting viewer, the return of...well, if you don't know I won't give it away, but I haven't seen this particular character so masterfully portrayed since the original in the early 1970's. It must be admitted that the climax in part three is just a tad fanciful and will induce a sense of deja vu in anyone who in their childhood attested their belief in magic and clapped their hands accordingly so as to revive Tinkerbell, but this didn't really bother me consciously till well afterwards, meaning that the writers succeeded in getting me to suspend my disbelief long enough for them to get away with their forgivable little cheat.All in all then, the show's creators have struck a fine balance throughout between the futuristic and the pseudo-historical, the cozily familiar and the out-on-a-limb unusual, the thoughtfully speculative and the chills & thrills adventurous. Of course tastes will differ, but my impression anyway is that ""Doctor Who"" has now really come into its own again as a wonderfully excellent science fiction TV program with this compelling variety of storylines in series three, all of which can be watched and enjoyed again and again (along with all the usual extras and behind-the-scenes programs) on this attractively packaged DVD set--a bit sturdier in design than the last two, thankfully.

1082383,A1RD1LL5E5JZOT,B000RL5H6Y,"Crookedmouth "":-/""","[0, 0]","Doctor Who needs little introduction - a TV sci-fi series that started way back in the 1960's that ran more or less continuously until the late 1980's and was required Saturday night viewing for generations of British kids. It was notable for it's scary monster of the week theme, the changing title role, the Doctor's slightly ramshackle mode of conveyance and the variety of &#34;Doctor's Companions&#34;. Sadly, it was also notable for it's limited budget, wobbly sets and man-in-a-rubber-suit aliens. However, despite its failings, it gained a special place in the nation's conciousness and is looked back on with fondness by many.After a seventeen year break, the series restarted in 2005 with new writers, Doctors and companions and it has gone from strength to strength since.This, the third series of the new run of Doctor Who is a patchy affair, veering wildly between good and (sorry about this) terrible, even within individual episodes. The episode listing is:- &#34;Smith and Jones&#34;- &#34;The Shakespeare Code&#34;- &#34;Gridlock&#34;- &#34;Daleks in Manhattan&#34;- &#34;Evolution of the Daleks&#34;- &#34;The Lazarus Experiment&#34;- &#34;42&#34;- &#34;Human Nature&#34;- &#34;The Family of Blood&#34;- &#34;Blink&#34;- &#34;Utopia&#34;- &#34;The Sound of Drums&#34;- &#34;Last of the Time Lords&#34;The rather lovely Martha (Freema Agyeman) makes her debut as The Doctor's new companion and her nose is immediately put out of joint by the Doc who is on the rebound from losing Rose. Sadly, too much is made of this - it persists as a minor theme through the entire season and it undermines Martha as a character and Ms Agyeman as a performer. Neither recover from the slight and it's no surprise that they depart at the end of the season.As I said, there is good and bad to the episode listing, but yet again, the large part of the action takes place on the exotic and exciting planet of... earth. To be honest, the teasers at the end of each episode are becoming a bit of a disappointment when it becomes clear that, yes, it's bloody Earth yet again. That said, one of the best episodes - &#34;Blink&#34; is firmly rooted on our home planet, and in the current timeframe at that. It's a very well scripted and plotted story, poignant and exciting by turns. Quite apart from the genuinely scary baddies (not, I'm afraid, a given in the series), putting the incredibly winsome Carey Mulligan front and centre was clearly a masterstroke. That The Doctor barely features is (ahem) no bad thing.Contrast this with The Lazarus Experiment. Now, I do appreciate Mark Gatis' points as a dramatic actor - he makes a grand, old school baddie - but he's catastrophically let down by a plot that doesn't so much borrow fromThe Flyas pillage it shamelessly (and for neither the first nor last time, I'm sad to say) and by a CGI monster that deserves a Golden Raspberry with Oak Leaves and Crossed Spoons.The Daleks make their obligatory reappearance in a 2-parter. The plot here takes a moderately interesting turn by stripping the head pepperpot of his armour and putting him in - of all things - a pinstripe suit. Unfortunately I  struggled to get past the bit where black characters are made out to be respected members - even leaders - of a happy multiracial community. I despise historical revisionism of this sort. It's no less egregious in a programme that is aimed at younger viewers who may not know any better.&#34;Human Nature/Family of Blood&#34; is another 2-parter and not a bad 'un, either. Possibly my favourite part was Harry Lloyd's Flashman impression. I had NO idea until I Googled him that he went on to playGoT's Viserys Targaryen(I KNEW I recognised him!). The episodes have some real tension built in and even a bit of romance and it's only let down by the (yawn) rather prosaic location and (yawn yawn) the scarecrow monsters. Don't waste bullets! Chuck lit matches at 'em, for heavens' sake!The final 3 part series introduces us to a new-old baddie (I shan't spoil the surprise). Again, the balance sheet is finely... balanced. Apparently, earth in the year six-squillion is populated by humans who /still/ haven't evolved. There are still internal combustion engined vehicles and Kalashnikov rifles. However, the universe is dying - a jolly decent premise which is gaily chucked out of the Tardis' window when our heroes simply pop back to 21st century earth to complete the story.I'm afraid I can only give this season three stars - &#34;It's OK&#34;.

It's clear that the Doctor still has Rose on his mind and for most of Season 3 Martha spins along like a fifth wheel. Poor girl, she's been thrown into a world in which she just cannot compete.Martha issues notwithstanding, David Tennant gets a chance to stretch out and show what he really is capable of. The last two discs show us a Doctor with compassion beyond compare; a truly vengeful Doctor; a soul with truly human depths and I love it. I see nothing wrong with my favourite Timelord altering his DNA to disguise himself and not wanting to change back. There is nothing wrong with him becoming almost a messiah to put things to rights.

Smith & Jones that is (and not that the Runaway Bride wasn't great, as it was) which was the first pairing of Tennant and his new companion Martha Jones, played superbly by Freema Agyeman. The breakneck speed that threw me for a loop in Season One's opener Rose was back. Again, it offered a highly enjoyable and tightly scripted lead-in, to where the Doctor has to explain and open the eyes of a new Earth companion, to his many dimensions of both time and space.If you read my review of Season 2, I explained how I felt that with Series 1, there was simply nothing better on TV at that time, either a sci-fi or other genre show, but during Series 2, while still a very good watch and excellent season of Who, I couldn't safely say there was nothing better on televison. Well, now I am back to my original thought, that with Series 3, there isn't anything I'd rather be watching on television, and nothing more entertaining.I couldn't help but quickly make a comparison of Martha Jones to Mary Tamm's Romana in the original Who series, as someone of a high intellect and someone constantly keeping up to the Doctor in terms of wit, composure, and sophistication. While even though she is just a medical student, and not yet a Doctor when she's swept up into the Tardis, she's as sharp as a surgeon's blade in playing the part of a new Who companion. There were quite the shoes to fill with Rose's departure, and Freema has just about (but not fully) made me forget about Rose. Speaking of Rose, she is recollected in this series, through the Doctor's alouds, and it really sets the tone for a new Doctor-Companion relationship that we may have never seen before. Martha shares a kiss already with the Doc in the first episode, and is lying in bed with him in the second! Oh, Martha!Anyway, with the Daleks, the Master, and the Face of Boe, the surprises just keep coming in this season. It really rivals the first in terms of the best of the new Doctor Who, and after seeing all 3, unfortunately makes season 2 seem all the more weaker than 1 and 3. Again, I revert to my opinion that it's the writing that was at fault in series 2, and the scripts, dialogue, and character interaction weren't quite as enjoyable as what came before, and what has obviously come now. Some call 2 the sophomore slump, or as one Amazon.co.uk reveiwer put it, that ""second album"", where there was just something a little less in keeping it from receiving the gem status that I give 1 & 3.This is a must have season of Who. It also sees David Tennant really settling into his role and upping his status as one of the best of the Doctors.  Amazingly, the weakest episodes in the series (if you can call any weak, as they are all quite entertaining) are the Daleks two parter and the series finale.I was a little sad to see that Martha is only returning for Series 4 in a more limited role, and that Catherine Tate was set to become a companion again (from the Runaway Bride Xmas episode).  I liked Tate a lot in that one show, but I am not sure I want her as a continued regular, as she sort of gets on your nerves.  We'll just have to wait and see, but Martha being relegated to a lesser role is definitely a minus in my opinion.As of this writing, audio commentaries, deleted scenes, video diaries, and the Doctor Who Confidential episodes are on slate as box set extras.",5,A quick revisit to what made the first season so special.,1188345600,"08 29, 2007",2007,3445,"['Wow', 'word', 'was', 'how', 'felt', 'watching', 'first', 'episode', 'new', 'Doctor', 'Who', '3rd', 'season', 'Smith', 'Jones', 'not', 'Runaway', 'Bride', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'was', 'was', 'first', 'pairing', 'Tennant', 'new', 'companion', 'Martha', 'Jones', 'played', 'superbly', 'Freema', 'Agyeman', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'threw', 'loop', 'Season', 'One', 'opener', 'Rose', 'was', 'back', 'Again', 'offered', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'tightly', 'scripted', 'lead-in', 'where', 'Doctor', 'explain', 'open', 'eyes', 'new', 'Earth', 'companion', 'many', 'dimensions', 'time', 'space.If', 'read', 'review', 'Season', '2', 'explained', 'how', 'felt', 'Series', '1', 'was', 'simply', 'nothing', 'better', 'TV', 'time', 'either', 'sci-fi', 'other', 'genre', 'show', 'Series', '2', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'watch', 'excellent', 'season', 'Who', 'could', ""n't"", 'safely', 'say', 'was', 'nothing', 'better', 'televison', 'Well', 'now', 'am', 'back', 'original', 'thought', 'Series', '3', ""n't"", 'anything', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'watching', 'television', 'nothing', 'more', 'entertaining.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'quickly', 'make', 'comparison', 'Martha', 'Jones', 'Mary', 'Tamm', 'Romana', 'original', 'Who', 'series', 'someone', 'high', 'intellect', 'someone', 'constantly', 'keeping', 'up', 'Doctor', 'terms', 'wit', 'composure', 'sophistication', 'even', 'just', 'medical', 'student', 'not', 'yet', 'Doctor', 'when', 'swept', 'up', 'Tardis', 'as', 'sharp', 'surgeon', 'blade', 'playing', 'part', 'new', 'Who', 'companion', 'were', 'quite', 'shoes', 'fill', 'Rose', 'departure', 'Freema', 'just', 'about', 'not', 'fully', 'made', 'forget', 'Rose', 'Speaking', 'Rose', 'recollected', 'series', 'Doctor', 'alouds', 'really', 'tone', 'new', 'Doctor-Companion', 'relationship', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'Martha', 'shares', 'kiss', 'already', 'Doc', 'first', 'episode', 'lying', 'bed', 'second', 'Oh', 'Martha', 'Anyway', 'Daleks', 'Master', 'Face', 'Boe', 'surprises', 'just', 'keep', 'coming', 'season', 'really', 'first', 'terms', 'best', 'new', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'seeing', '3', 'unfortunately', 'season', '2', 'seem', 'more', 'weaker', '1', '3', 'Again', 'revert', 'opinion', 'writing', 'was', 'fault', 'series', '2', 'scripts', 'dialogue', 'character', 'interaction', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'obviously', 'come', 'now', 'call', '2', 'sophomore', 'slump', 'one', 'Amazon.co.uk', 'reveiwer', 'put', 'second', 'album', 'where', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'little', 'less', 'keeping', 'receiving', 'gem', 'status', 'give', '1', '3.This', 'must', 'have', 'season', 'Who', 'also', 'David', 'Tennant', 'really', 'settling', 'role', 'upping', 'status', 'one', 'best', 'Doctors', 'Amazingly', 'weakest', 'episodes', 'series', 'can', 'call', 'weak', 'are', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'are', 'Daleks', 'two', 'parter', 'series', 'finale.I', 'was', 'little', 'sad', 'see', 'Martha', 'only', 'returning', 'Series', '4', 'more', 'limited', 'role', 'Catherine', 'Tate', 'was', 'set', 'become', 'companion', 'again', 'Runaway', 'Bride', 'Xmas', 'episode', 'liked', 'Tate', 'lot', 'one', 'show', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'want', 'continued', 'regular', 'sort', 'nerves', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'wait', 'see', 'Martha', 'being', 'relegated', 'lesser', 'role', 'definitely', 'minus', 'opinion.As', 'writing', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'video', 'diaries', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Confidential', 'episodes', 'are', 'slate', 'box', 'set', 'extras']",N/A

1082393,A1RQQCPDN7ZCHU,B000RL5H6Y,"E.A. Week ""reviewer-at-large""","[7, 9]","The BBC kick-started its former flagship series, ""Doctor Who,"" in 2005 and enjoyed two tremendous initial seasons.  But sooner or later, every TV series hits stones in the road, and unfortunately, the third time turned out not such a charm for head writer/ executive producer, Russell T Davies.Part of the first two seasons' success was the focus on the companion as the viewers' primary route into the Doctor's bizarre world.  For two seasons, Billie Piper's Rose Tyler provided that and more: a confident, sympathetic companion to the ancient time-traveler, an ordinary young human with whom the audience could identify.  But Piper (wisely) quit after two seasons, and her departure left a huge gap in the series, as Rose took much of the supporting cast with her to an alternate universe.The show also owed its success to much terrific writing, directing, and acting.  By season three, though, Davies and his team were also producing a spin-off series, ""Torchwood,"" stretching thin the staff's creative energy.  In Who's third season, this strain showed most obviously with its new companion, medical student Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman).  Unlike Rose, where a great deal of care and attention was put into writing the character, Martha seems to have been created on the fly, cast in haste, and then--after a terrific debut in the season opener, 'Smith and Jones'--cut adrift by the writing staff.  The character's development is uneven, her motivations inconsistent, and although she comes into her own admirably by the end of the season, that development often feels contrived rather than organic.This is all a pity, because the character has a lot of potential, but the scripts rarely connect the dots.  Martha's motivations--for pursuing a career in medicine, for traveling with the Doctor, for continuing to stay with him when he treats her coldly--are never explicit.  Instead, the writers fall back on a hackneyed schoolgirl crush, undercutting the character's much-touted intelligence.  Martha has a large and dysfunctional family (mostly there, ultimately, as a weapon for the season's Big Bad to use against the Doctor), but again, it's never stated outright that Martha takes off with the Doctor to escape them.  Agyeman is an immanently likeable performer: warm, expressive, and funny, but she's just not skilled or experienced enough to rise above this kind of shoddy writing.  She has numerous good scenes scattered over the season, but frustratingly, they add up to less than a cohesive whole.The episodes themselves are a spotty batch: many lack emotional depth ('The Shakespeare Code'), feel rushed ('42'), recycled ('Gridlock'), or are just disjointed (the Dalek two-parter).  The three-part season finale ('Utopia,' 'Sound of Drums,' 'Last of the Time Lords') is terrific in some places (thanks in large part to a show-stopping guest performance by John Simm) but clumsy in many others, and the efforts to conceal the Master's rebirth were painfully coy.  Jack Harkness has a welcome return, and some unanswered questions about the character are resolved at last, but otherwise, actor John Barrowman spends most of these stories propping up scenery.  'Time Lords' in particular is a wincingly awful mess, capped by the worst of all possible storytelling devices, the cosmic reset button.A handful of strong episodes makes the season worthwhile.  The 2006 Christmas special, 'The Runaway Bride,' is a lot of fun, allowing the Doctor some touching (but not overwrought) moments to grieve the loss of Rose; Catherine Tate's turn as the ultimate Bridezilla is just brilliant; and viewers get a disturbing look at what the Doctor's capable of when his ire is roused.  'The Lazarus Experiment' is likewise terrific, a classic monster story with good work from the whole cast and some genuine emotional resonance.  But the standout stories are the two-part 'Human Nature'/ 'Family of Blood,' a historical piece set at a pre-World War I boarding school, and 'Blink,' a mind-bending horror story.  These episodes are superbly written, boasting stellar performances from the guest and main casts, thematic depth, and genuinely creepy aliens.  HN/FoB is a bona-fide standout, among the best stories in the revived series, a poignant meditation on the nature of love and identity that will haunt viewers long after the credits roll.Despite the myriad writing problems, the season holds together surprisingly well, thanks in large part to the considerable talents of David Tennant.  Tennant needed less than one season to establish himself as perhaps the most iconic Doctor in the history of the series--eclipsing even perennial favorite Tom Baker--and in the third season, he continues to take viewers along on the character's epic emotional journey.  Tennant has any number of powerful moments, even in the weakest episodes: he knows exactly when to be funny, angry, thoughtful, curious, or lovelorn.  He achieves a perfect balance between over-the-top and understated; he plays beautifully off his fellow cast members (providing needed ballast for newcomer Agyeman); he makes the character at once human (accessible) and alien (remote); he's by turns fallible, generous, heroic, petty, and exuberant.  Tennant breathes life and meaning into even the most tepid dialogue, and his love for the character and the series comes across in everything he does.  He deserves particular accolades for his performance in 'Human Nature'/ 'Family of Blood,' where his work as the dual Doctor/ John Smith character is nothing short of astonishing.The DVD extras will be of great interest to fans (especially the outtakes and deleted scenes), and Tennant's video diaries provide a fun look into the leading man's workday (the shot of him disco dancing around the set in old man prosthetics should not be missed).  The packaging of the boxed set and the DVD booklet are beautiful, making it even more of a shame that the episodes themselves aren't stronger.  Overall, the set is well-worth the money, especially for hardcore fans of the show.The 2007 Christmas special, 'Voyage of the Damned' established stronger footing for the series, and one can only hope the fourth season is more memorable than the third.",4,Bumpy Third Season,1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,6208,"['BBC', 'kick-started', 'former', 'flagship', 'series', 'Doctor', 'Who', '2005', 'enjoyed',

Martha Jones does it handedly surpassing all of my expectations.  With most of the Doctor Who seasons one can always find a weak link but I cannot do that here because Standalone episodes which can be weak as a rarity here.Smith and Jones-Good sets up the season very nicely newly admitted patient John Smith (the doctor) notices strange emissions from a hospital and checks himself in what he discovers could (surprise) prove very disastrous for earth.  Not my favorite episode but that doesn't mean it's bad.The Shakespeare Code-Normally I hate the standalones but this has the Bard in it so one can't stay mad at it forever.  This one stands out as probably my favorite standalone of the entire season.Gridlock is also another great standalone episode while you could be critical and say its just another ""God in the Machine"" Doctor saves the day type set up, isn't that the entire point my friend?The two parter Daleks in Manhattan / Evolution of the Daleks is the first of such episodes for the season they do not disappoint and touch on many issues a strange scifi/horror commentary on Depression Era America well worth the watch.  Is a kinder gentler Dalek possible?If there is anything that could be called a ""bad"" episode The Lazarus Experiment is probably it.  I felt it was pointless and never exerted anything more then a ""villain of the week"" type quality.  The Doctor/Martha one liners are always great but in terms of the overall story arch it doesn't make any sense.42 I don't much care for this one but watch it anyway because there is an interesting revelation at the end that is important for future revelations at the end of the season.Human Nature/Family of the BloodOriginally a novelization staring a different doctor all together it poses an interesting point (and not a bad story line to go with it) could the Doctor live life as a normal Human being?  With his home destroyed would be want to?Blink is again one of the standalones but it is an interesting take on an episode that does not exactly focus on either the Doctor or Martha Jones.Utopia / The Sound of Drums / Last of the Time LordsThe crown jewel in the third season and if I may say so the entire relauch so far.  The Doctor and Martha take a trip 100 trillion years in the future where the last of the suns is going out and the Time Lords aren't even a legend.  I cannot spoil this one for you just watch it and see.Overall-When David Tennant replaced the first of the re-launch Doctors I was highly skeptical but he does grow on you in a positive way.

And an appearance by Sir Dereck Jacobi in one episode as the leader of a band of lost humans, is so masterfully handled that you know why he is considered a national treasure to the British stage.There is no doubt that Tennant is a Doctor to hold his own with any of the original actors and his delivery of most lines such as ""I will give you one piece of advice though, 'RUN!'""  or scenes such as wandering in the sewers of a major metropolitan city followed by bemused companions are the sort which long time Whovians can envisage being said or done by any Doctor, a testament to the actor, the writer and the directors.

Davies wants to take the show into a new area by adding more drama in it, which in my opion ruins the show. Although you still get a lot of action, you also get a lot of drama too. Drama can help a program, but too much slows it down. That's how I feel about this season. It's not as fast paced or as exciting as the two previous seasons. And what's up with Martha?! I have nothing against the actress who plays her, but her character is way to obsessed with the Doctor. And unlike Rose who had a great and thoughtful premiere, it seemed to me that Martha Jones was just thrown into the show so that the Doctor could have someone to talk to.At least for the most part, the stories were still good and intriguing though. The only one that wasn't was ""Blink"" which I didn't find good in any way at all. It had WAY too much drama in it, not enough of the Doctor and Martha in it, and I didn't even think it was scary. Statues that send you back in time - what's scary about that? But still not a terrible season.

1082444,A27P0MW8TE1JQP,B000RL5H6Y,Kevin J. Loria,"[207, 224]","The strength of DOCTOR WHO, the new series and the original, has always been change, and change it has. Over forty-years ago the show began with one actor and now we have 10 actors who have portrayed the 900+ Timelord.  The first season of the new series ended by changing leads through regeneration, as the 2nd season ended with the ""lost"" of not only the companion / love interest, but the whole ""point-of-view"" for the new series: Rose Tyler. Since the PILOT or ""ROSE"" episode the series has been through her eyes. The viewers could relate to the Human perspective more readily than the sometimes alien POV of the title character.  In fact, the series gave up not only Rose, but her family, Mickey Smith, Jackie Tyler; Mum, Pete Tyler ( deceased, sort of) ,all of the anchor characters that added so much emotion to the new series.Can the series, even one a clever and cool as Dr. Who, survive such change.The answer is yes, definitely, yes. Although, there is a loss, infact the sense of loss that the viewer feels, is surely an undercurrent of the entire season, starting with the Christmas special or THE RUNAWAY BRIDE, the precursor to the true first episode of the season. Opening right after series two leaves off, the Bride a.k.a Donna Noble played by U.K. comedian Catherine Tate appears in the TARDIS, the Doctor has little time to contemplate his loss before he is literally running for his life again. Like the Christmas Invasion, the special is light-hearted, and introduces a ""one-shot"" temporary companion (although Donna will be a major-part of season 4). One highlight of the ""BRIDE"" would be the glorious soundtrack provided by composer Murray Gold, a truly cinematic fully orchestral backdrop that sells some fanboy innovative moments like a CAR CHASE WITH THE TARDIS ( I kid u not, the iconic Call-box is zipping though traffic like something from a 70's cop-show) . Donna sums up the subtle theme as she declines the role of companion, stating that the Doctor needs someone to ""stop him from going to far"" as he coldly sticks to his assertion of the previous Christmas: ""No second chances"" while dispatching the Empress and her brood.In the second story in this set, but the actual season opener, new regular companion MARTHA JONES is introduced in a satisfying start to 2007 in ""SMITH and JONES"" ( a goof reference to the Doctor's sometimes alias of Dr. John Smith which shows up again in the season, too). An all too different character than Rose, Martha is Medical Student, so she doesn't need the Doctor to rescue her from her life as slacker Rose did, she's smart in a less pop culture way than Rose, more analytical like the Doctor. Like Rose, we meet her family in the episodes opening over several rapid-fire conversations via cellphone.  Strange things are afoot at her hospital which eventually ends up on the Moon. More as window dressing, the Jadoon Stormtroopers, beautifully realized alien police are searching for an vampiric alien among the human patients and doctors.  Martha and the Doctor immediately develop an enjoyable on screen chemistry, while storytellers cut to the chase and give us two instances of Doctor/Companion kisses, the throwaway nature establishes the preoccupied (with love-lost) tone that the Doctor will regard Martha (unfortunately more like a traditional Dr. Who relationship). The Doctor spells this out saying, ""this doesn't mean anything,"" sadly for Martha, this feeling isn't mutual and leads to choices made by the end of the season. So the Doctor sacrifices himself to flush out the fugitive, while Martha literally breaths her final breath in an attempt to save the Doctor's life, earning herself a non-committal invite to the TARDIS.The major part of the first half of the 13 show season, 14 with the ""Bride"" Special (#0) is weak. Smith & Jones (#1) is strong, the Shakespeare Code (#2) is frankly BRILLIANT!GRIDLOCK (#3) is very good, but the Dalek 2 parter: ""Daleks in Manhattan"" and ""Evolution of the Daleks (#4-5)"", NOT SO BRILLIANT, nor is ""Lazarius Experiment (#6)"" or ""42 (#7)"" But the final HALF of the season (#8-13) is GOLDEN, leading up to a 3 part finale re-introducing a classic character that will blow you away!!! Away !!!""SHAKESPEARE CODE"", Martha's first trip back in time, they meet the Bard himself and learn the secret of Shakespeare's famous lost play. This was film partly in the real rebuild Globe Theater, so it looks great. As is Dean Kelly's rock-n-roll performance as the renown playwright. This contains some of the best dialogue the series has EVER had, so much so that you much watch it repeatedly to truly appreciate this one ( I played this one to high-schoolers as a follow-up to Hamlet).""GRIDLOCK,"" is a great sci-fi story, in which people are living their lives stuck decades and decades on a skyway traffic jam.  The is the 3rd story in the new series history to go to the far-future ""New Earth"" and the Doctor meets the Face of Boe for the prophesied  3rd and final time. A super concept with great effects and some genuinely moving moments, like the music montage of the stranded freeway drivers connected by faith and song. The Face reveals a secret to the Doctor which tips us off to the season finale.The DALEKS in MANHATTAN"" and ""EVOLUTION of the DALEKS"" is the Doctor's apology to Martha for showing off taking her to New Earth on the rebound as it were, but overall this 2 part doesn't work. There is some great integration of footage actually shot in modern NYC, reworked to look like the 1920's, but the premise that the sole surviving Daleks (the Cult of Skaro, seen escaping last season's finale) are making not only PIG-Slaves, but the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING itself as part of a plan to recreate their race using humans for materials. There are some good performances all around, but the ""Evolution"" of the Human-Dalek (both costume and concept), is disappointing and distracting. But, the Art Deco 1930s style Empire State Build does lend itself to that of the Daleks.Episodes 6 and 7, ""The LAZARIUS EXPERIMENT"" and ""42"" are both so derivative of Popular sci-fi that they are unsatisfying when compared to some of the really great shows of the season. LAZARIUS is very much a variation on ""the FLY"" while ""42"" with its real time concept (""24"" reversed) and spacecraft claustrophobia is like both Impossible Planet of last season and other movies of the genre. But, Dr. Lazarius himself is afforded an excellent performance by Dr. Who writer Mark Gatiss ( of ""League of Gentlemen"" and ""Jekyll"").Again proving that the producers are true fans themselves, episodes 8 and 9, Human Nature and The Family of Blood, are based on a fan favorite Dr. Who Novel (with the 7th Doctor), translating seamlessly to TV. It is a classic story idea, the Doctor becomes Human!!  In order to escape a family of aliens ( a concept already borrowed from the novel for season one's Slitheens, an alien surname) the Doctor puts his Timelord identity into a watch, only Martha knows who he is and is put in charge of this secret as he really becomes John Smith, History teacher (of course) of a boys school just before WWI. I can't say enough about the heart-wrenching excellence of this 2 parter. The Doctor falls in love and must make some hard choices. This also sets up things to come in the finale.Episode 10, ""BLINK,"" happens to be filler, like last seasons ""Love and Monsters"" in which the regular cast is all but absent in order to shoot another episode simultaneously. Like ""Love and Monsters"" this episode is a creative triumph, also base on a previously published story. ""BLINK"" also happens to be the scariest show of the new series history!In a nutshell, the Doctor is sending messages from the past to ""the present"" through DVD extras or easter eggs, warning about weeping angel statues that move at you when no one is looking, so don't even blink! Although, no one is killed on screen, not in any conventional sense, this one is still keeping my kids up at night (especially in a city famous for its cemeteries) ! BLINK was written by Steven Moffat, two-time consequtive HUGO winner (both for DR.WHO, series 2 the ""GIRL IN THE FIREPLACE"" and series one's ""EMPTY CHILD."" Moffat has next year's Hugo in the bag with BLINK, if his writing in JEKYLL doesn't split the vote (see my review for more on JEKYLL).The final 3 parter, ""UTOPIA"", ""The SOUND of DRUMS"" and ""LAST of the TIMELORDS"" are perfection. Really. I can say more without revealing too much (although the U.K. press already did that long before the shows aired), but the season is full of clues leading up to this (even in TORCHWOODS final episodes there are clues). Capt. Jack returns for all three of these and there are notable guest appearances such as SIR DEREK JACOBI ( famous for I, Claudius), how great is that!! Also, John Sims (from Life on Mars).  The first of these 3 parts, UTOPIA, comes across as a Mad Max deal, don't give up on it, that is just subterfuge! Make plans to watch the three of these back-to-back-to-back, you're not gonna' want to stop.",5,Don't turn away....Don't even BLINK!......,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,9035,"['strength', 'DOCTOR',

1082445,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000RL5H6Y,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 2]","David Tennant's second season as everybody's favorite Doctor is wonderful.  It features some of the best adventures in the revived show's run.  While many may miss Billie Piper's Rose, Freema Agyeman is more than sufficient as the Doctor's latest companion, Martha.  The duo meet in the season opener (albeit the second show of the actual season), ""Smith & Jones.""  That particular episode gives viewers a dose of creepiness thanks to a blood-sucking villain who's on the run from the Judoon, a rhino-like alien species who patrol the stars looking for baddies.The rest of the season is filled with plenty of highlights.  In particular, the Doctor and Martha face off against witches in ""The Shakespeare Code"" which actually features William Shakespeare (a theme of bumping into literary legends that has flourished in the series revival).  Two excellent two-show arcs also pop up during this season.  The Daleks return in ""Daleks in Manhattan"" and ""Evolution of the Daleks"" and a new enemy appears in ""Human Nature"" and ""Family of Blood.""The best show of the entire revival is also found in this season of Who.  ""Blink"" is scary, suspenseful and the pinnacle of the creepiness that haunts this entire season.  Using a familiar fixture of cemetaries, churches and office buildings, this story will make you look twice (and not blink) at certain statues you come across in everyday life.With so much excellence running throughout the entire season, you'd think that even the subpar episodes would be brilliant.  Unfortunately that isn't so.  While ""The Lazarus Experiment,"" ""42"" and the first episode of a three show arc, ""Utopia,"" are all solid, episodes such as the dull ""Gridlock"" and the downright goofy ""The Last of the Time Lords"" actually grate the nerves of fans of the original series.  Even the return of Captain Jack can't save the season finale from being something of a disappointment.  ""The Runaway Bride"" also toys with the goofy factor.Two of the Doctor's classic television villains return this season.  One gets a CGI update in the not-so-hot ""Gridlock"" and the other appears in the three-episode finale (although sharp viewers will recognize his name before he actually appears on screen).  Derek Jacobi and John Simm portray this baddie who I'll keep nameless for now, but Simm's portrayal is too over-the-top for me.  There's even a very light hint at another of the Doctor's classic foes, but whether or not SHE will ever make a comeback is unknown at this time.Special features include ""Doctor Who Confidential"" episodes, Tennant's video diary, deleted scenes, promos, etc. including a fun political endorsement from Sharon Osbourne for a character that viewers will get to know quite well by the end of the season.Tennant and Agyeman are the glue that keeps this season afloat.  While there are a few misses in this season, their performances and the excellence of ""Blink"" and ""The Shakespeare Code"" make this a must-have season.Recommended to fans of both the classic and revived Who series as well as anybody who enjoys action, suspense, comedy and a good dose of horror to boot.",4,A Great Season With Just A Few Slips In Time,1219708800,"08 26, 2008",2008,3104,"['David', 'Tennant', 'second', 'season', 'everybody', 'favorite', 'Doctor', 'wonderful', 'best', 'adventures', 'revived', 'show', 'run', 'many', 'may', 'miss', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'Rose', 'Freema', 'Agyeman', 'more', 'sufficient', 'Doctor', 'latest', 'companion', 'Martha', 'duo', 'meet', 'season', 'opener', 'second', 'show', 'actual', 'season', 'Smith', 'Jones', 'particular', 'episode', 'viewers', 'dose', 'creepiness', 'thanks', 'blood-sucking', 'villain', 'who', 'run', 'Judoon', 'rhino-like', 'alien', 'species', 'who', 'patrol', 'stars', 'looking', 'baddies.The', 'rest', 'season', 'filled', 'plenty', 'highlights', 'particular', 'Doctor', 'Martha', 'face', 'off', 'witches', 'Shakespeare', 'Code', 'actually', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'theme', 'bumping', 'literary', 'legends', 'flourished', 'series', 'revival', 'Two', 'excellent', 'two-show', 'arcs', 'also', 'up', 'season', 'Daleks', 'return', 'Daleks', 'Manhattan', 'Evolution', 'Daleks', 'new', 'enemy', 'Human', 'Nature', 'Family', 'Blood', 'best', 'show', 'entire', 'revival', 'also', 'found', 'season', 'Who', 'Blink', 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'pinnacle', 'creepiness', 'entire', 'season', 'Using', 'familiar', 'fixture', 'cemetaries', 'churches', 'office', 'buildings', 'story', 'will', 'make', 'look', 'twice', 'not', 'blink', 'certain', 'statues', 'come', 'everyday', 'life.With', 'so', 'much', 'excellence', 'running', 'entire', 'season', ""'d"", 'think', 'even', 'subpar', 'episodes', 'would', 'be', 'brilliant', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'so', 'Lazarus', 'Experiment', '42', 'first', 'episode', 'three', 'show', 'arc', 'Utopia', 'are', 'solid', 'episodes', 'such', 'dull', 'Gridlock', 'downright', 'goofy', 'Last', 'Time', 'Lords', 'actually', 'grate', 'nerves', 'fans', 'original', 'series', 'Even', 'return', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'season', 'finale', 'being', 'something', 'disappointment', 'Runaway', 'Bride', 'also', 'goofy', 'factor.Two', 'Doctor', 'classic', 'television', 'return', 'season', 'One', 'CGI', 'update', 'not-so-hot', 'Gridlock', 'other', 'three-episode', 'finale', 'sharp', 'viewers', 'will', 'recognize', 'name', 'actually', 'screen', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'John', 'Simm', 'portray', 'baddie', 'who', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'nameless', 'now', 'Simm', 'portrayal', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'even', 'very', 'light', 'hint', 'Doctor', 'classic', 'foes', 'not', 'SHE', 'will', 'ever', 'make', 'comeback', 'unknown', 'time.Special', 'features', 'include', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Confidential', 'episodes', 'Tennant', 'video', 'diary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'promos', 'etc', 'including', 'fun', 'political', 'endorsement', 'Sharon', 'Osbourne', 'character', 'viewers', 'will', 'get', 'know', 'quite', 'well', 'end', 'season.Tennant', 'Agyeman', 'are', 'glue', 'season', 'afloat', 'are', 'few', 'misses', 'season', 'performances', 'excellence', 'Blink', 'Shakespeare', 'Code', 'make', 'must-have', 'season.Recommended', 'fans', 'classic', 'revived', 'Who', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'anybody', 'who', 'action', 'suspense', 'comedy', 'good', 'dose', 'horror', 'boot']",N/A

Instead everything was sweetness and light from the get go.  There were certainly high points and the finale was heartbreaking enough to make me cry, but Season 3 starts off with that emotional impact and that makes it all the better.Season 3 is really all about the Doctor, as it should be, and his pain.  He struggles constantly with his need for a companion (he is a social animal, after all) and his conflicts about the nature of his relationship with a companion and his reluctance to get hurt as deeply again as he was by the loss of Rose.

Although I will add that The Lazarus experiment could have been better had the Doctor stopped playing head games with Martha earlier on instead pretending he didn't want Martha to come along until the very end (also I didn't like the headband they put on her, it was distracting and she didn't need it but that's a fashion objection).Anyway, Human Nature and Family of Blood although well-acted was hard to watch as Martha is completely disrespected, not so much by the people in 1913 rather by the Doctor himself, and because he'd become John Smith, the human, is no excuse.  John Smith was a whiner and just pathetic while the only one who had any spine in that episode was Martha and when the Doctor was restored to himself he allowed Martha to pretty much apologize to him for daring to tell John Smith that she love the Doctor but in this series the Doctor is not worth loving.If you don't care about the Martha character than Human Nature and Family of Blood episodes are great, but I felt dirty after watching these episodes, they could have at least had ancestors of Martha there working for the school so she'd have someone to turn to.In reality Martha being young, pretty and petite would never have survived three months in rural England, with no other Black people around and without the Doctor being in his right mind during 1913.

(PERSONAL OPINION FOLLOWS:)  But my ""love/hate"" relationship with all the newer ""series"" tipped to hate and disgust with the last two episodes here; when, it finally dawned on me--that the current producer is no longer paying homage to what came before his tenure (IF he ever did), but is instead trashing the entire program's history! The trail of dead is enormous; he's killed off the Daleks (for the most part), and (his own creation) the ""face of Bo"", he's killed off the entire planet of Gallifrey, and also, K-9, (looked that way), and lastly the character of the ""Master"". He changed the Master to a clean shaven, effete Joker...and with that, I bade farewell to watching any more from THIS PRODUCTION; because now, it's clear that's it's no longer homage, but nose thumbing, self important aggrandizment, ignoring long time Who fandom, in order to over romantisize and elevate the Doc in a sort of ever accruing messianism.

In almost each episode, just wait and Tennant is sure enough to yell, ""Run!"", then he'll fiddle with the sonic screwdriver, the most OVERUSED prop ever, and somehow elude the villian, before wrapping up the episode leaving everyone out of breath (and bored with the predictability of the Doctor narrowly escaping yet another corny CGI-animated alien.)Oh, and I almost forgot: at least one thinly-veiled sex reference in each show, usually a gay one.The new Doctor is NOTHING compared to the classic original series.  In fact, this seems less and less like a continuation of the original series, and more like that of a rogue timelord.  I keep hoping that somewhere along the line, Tennant will meet the REAL Doctor (I guess he did once when he briefly ran into Peter Davison's Doctor... a breath of fresh air in this tiring new series.)Do youself a favor: backtrack, and work your way through Doctors 3-7.  Then realize how much better the writing was, and how much more entertaining the series could really be (even Colin Baker was better than Tennant... shocking as that is to admit.)Maybe I'm just stuck in old-school thinking, and I prefer the all-ages Doctor Who, instead of the new one, where regular features are grizzly mutilations, terrifying aliens (give me a cheesy Silurian alien rubber suit any day) and tiring sexual content (primarily Captain Jack: a character who is an immortal intergalactic promiscuous philanderer.  Oh, great writing there BBC.  And what lesson is this supposed to be teaching people?  Promiscuity is fine with anyone/anywhere because you're immortal?  Give me a break.)The return of the Master was a major disappointment.

1082490,A3TISHGXRLMTTV,B000RL5H6Y,Patrick Correa,"[0, 0]","The first full season I've seen of my favorite Doctor.  Overall it's quite good, aside from a couple missteps here & there, but nothing a little omission & imagination can't fix.  Here's a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.The Runaway Bride:  Donna, a woman about to walk down the aisle on her wedding day, suddenly materialises in the TARDIS, much to the shock of both her and the Doctor, who has just said his final goodbyes to Rose Tyler.  While trying to get her back to her wedding, the Time Lord discovers that Donna has been unwittingly been placed into the center of an alien plot.  The best of the Christmas Specials I've seen.  Donna is a wonderful companion & I look forward to seeing her in series 4. A+Smith And Jones:  The Doctor goes undercover at the Royal Hope Hospital in London, where he meets medical student Martha Jones.  The entire hospital is transported to the moon by an alien courier connected with the Judoon, a brutal outer-space police force.  An excellent start to the season.  A+The Shakespeare Code:  The Doctor and Martha land in 1599 London, Elizabethan England, where they discover that William Shakespeare is under influence of witch-like aliens known as Carrionites who are forcing him to finish Love's Labour's Won using a poppet.  This was a great episode, apart from a bit during the finale where the Doctor fell into a trap a little too easily.  Still, nobody died because of it so it was just a harmless bit of filler. A-Gridlock:  The TARDIS takes the Doctor and Martha to New Earth in the year Five Billion and Fifty-Three, where the Face of Boe will finally reveal ""The Great Secret"" to the Time Lord.  This was a very mixed bag for me.  There were some powerful moments, but there were also some stupid moments.  CDaleks In Manhattan:  The Doctor and Martha arrive in 1930's New York, where they expect to see dancing girls on Broadway and the dire effects of the Depression and instead encounter trouble as the Daleks return once more, this time attempting to create a Dalek/Human hybrid.  I'm not going to lie I thought this episode was pretty good.  A couple bits of filler, but that's to be expected in a two part story.  B+Evolution of the Daleks:  The Dalek plan is in full force until the human-Dalek hybrid, Dalek Sec, begins raising doubts among the three remaining Daleks.  When Dalek Sec asks for the Doctor's assistance in relocating them to a new planet, the other Daleks rebel, and The Doctor, Martha and their New York friends must fight to save the planet from the Daleks and a new type of foe.  This episode was terrible.  It was all downhill after the bit with the radio, though I loved the part where the Doctor saved Lazlo.  Do yourself a favor; stop after the radio scene & pretend the Daleks blew each other up in the confusion except for one.  DLazarus:  A 76 year old scientist, Doctor Lazarus of LazLabs, has created a device that appears to restore eternal youth.  However, the process doesn't go as planned, and The Doctor and Martha must stop Lazarus before it's too late.  A great episode.  A42:  The Doctor and Martha answer a distress call and find themselves on a cargo ship hurtling towards the center of the sun.  The Doctor only has 42 minutes to save Martha and the rest of the ship's crew from an inevitable doom.  This episode is just like 24, it starts out fine but as it goes on it gets worse, the complications get more and more contrived, etc.  This is worse than the Silurian 2 parter in Series 5, because the only good part is at the beginning, but you'll forget about it before the episode is over.  FHuman Nature:  John Smith is a teacher in the year 1913 who dreams of adventures that involve an alien time traveler who calls himself the Doctor and journeys through time and space in a blue box, picking up numerous companions along the way.  As John and Joan Redfern, the school nurse, begin to develop feelings for one another a mysterious other-worldly family with an army of animated scarecrows make their presence known, and Martha must find a way to keep the TARDIS hidden while still maintaining her school-maid identity.  Am I the only one who found this story overrated?  Don't get me wrong, this is the better part & it's worth it for the good parts, but it loses a little something towards the end.  A-Family of Blood:  The Great War arrives a year ahead of time as the Family of Blood takes over the bodies of four individuals and attack the school, all while the Doctor remains unaware of his true being.  Martha tries to convince the Doctor that the ""dreams"" he has recorded in his book are real and that it is his current life as a school master that is the fantasy.  As time runs out, John Smith faces an impossible decision while fighting to retain his identity.  I didn't like the first part of this episode, particularly the bit where the defense around the school crumbles after one death.  But everything after they get to the cottage is very good.  This really should have been just a one-part story.  That would have been much better.  C+Blink:  Sally Sparrow enters an abandoned house to take pictures, but things quickly escalate after she discovers a hidden message left just for her from 1969 and begins to notice statues that are never in the same place the next time you look.  The greatest Doctor Who story ever told.  This doesn't feel like a really good episode of a TV show, it feels like a short movie.  A+Utopia/The Sound of Drums/The Last of the Time Lords:  Professor Yana is trying to save mankind in the very distant future at the end of the universe, but is he what he seems?  This finale is excellent.  It would have gotten an A+ if it hadn't been for a scene in the last part where the Doctor becomes overly emotional for the villain.  Still, just skip that scene & you have a very good story.  ALike I said, great season overall.  A must-buy just for Blink.  Still, am I the only one who notices the 2 part stories sometimes aren't quite as good as the single episode stories?  How sad that a show that back in the 70s & 80s used to tell great 4 part stories with ease now struggles to make a good story longer than 45 minutes.  Still, the good outweighs the bad so I'll give it 5 stars.  Really, even if half the season sucked it would still get 4 stars for the good episodes & of course Blink.",5,Don't blink - or you may miss the chance to get this.,1376697600,"08 17,

1082493,A3UA40JOD3BE1M,B000RL5H6Y,"Paul Fogarty ""Hopeless film addict!""","[5, 5]","After the crazy, wonderful, ""Fan-TASTIC!"" roller coaster ride ofSeasons 1 & 2, with their ""Bad Wolf/The Parting of the Ways"" and ""Army of Ghosts/Doomsday"" finale's, it was almost inevitable that Season 3 would not be able to maintain the sheer excellence of what had gone before. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Season 3 is bad, not by a very long shot! You'll have noticed, I hope, the 5 Star rating, but to my mind at least, Season 3 didn't quite reach the same dizzying heights of 1 & 2, and the reason why is, I think, obvious... Rose Tyler.Her development, from London shop-girl, to time traveler, explorer of the universe, and killer of Daleks, helped drive the stories in a new more mature, more emotionally fulfilling direction, and let's not forget the heartbreaking finale on the beach in Norway! No,Seasons 1 & 2became the story of Rose - and Mickey, and Pete, and Jackie! - much asBabylon 5, when looked at from the perspective of the entire 5 year series, was the interconnected story of Londo and G'Kar.So, after all this bleating and whining about Rose, is Season 3 worth getting? If you've enjoyed the first two, the answer to that question is a definite and unequivocal ""YES!!!"" The new season gets off to a rollicking start with the now customary ""Christmas Special"" called, ""The Runaway Bride."" For me ""Donna,"" the titular Bride, played by Catherine Tate, is the reason this episode works so well. Walking up the Isle on her Wedding Day, she's inexplicably transported to the Console Room of the TARDIS whilst it's in flight; alternately yelling accusations and questions at the Doctor while barely stopping to hear answers she can't possibly comprehend, she's loud, brash, and obnoxious. Basically, she's the ""Anti-Rose!"" Her withering retort to the Doctor of, ""You're just making it up, that's not even a real word!"" when told that ""this"" is the ""TARDIS"" is typical of her approach, as is her repeated reference to him as ""Martian Boy!"" The episode also features the return of the robotic Santa's from ""The Christmas Invasion,"" this time in the service of a far more dangerous and malignant master, or should that be ""Mistress?!""The season proper gets off to a good start with the first official episode, ""Smith and Jones,"" which introduces us to the Doctor's new Companion, ""Martha Jones,"" a medical student who gets caught up in the hunt for a vampire-style alien that's taken refuge in the hospital where she works. Played by relative newcomer Freema Agyeman, Martha is Book-Smart AND Street-Smart; so, once again we have a companion who's almost the exact opposite of Rose, but without all the yelling and verbal abuse dished out by Donna! With the entire hospital somehow transported to the Moon and taken over by the Judoon, a kind of intergalactic police force - ""Judoon on the Moon"" the Doctor quips as their ships land in the distance - Martha more-or-less accepts the situation and works with the Doctor to find the ""alien"" before the Judoon find HIM. They may be cops and technologically advanced, but they're not very bright; they're looking for an alien and if they find the Doctor first, he'll be clapped in irons and hauled off to a cozy cell on one of those Judoon ships for transport to who-knows-where!Needless to say after being returned to Earth after many a close call, Martha can't wait for another adventure, so the Doctor whisks her off to meet ""The Bard"" himself in ""The Shakespeare Code,"" where there's the question of those pesky Witches to be dealt with! Again, another fun episode with a very contemporary ""Man Of Letters"" played by Dean Lennox Kelly, who greatly admires Martha's ""fitted"" attire; but oh dear, what did/will the Doctor do to upset Her Majesty?!?!?! LOL!So, Season 3 gets off to a very strong start, but as a whole, this is probably the most uneven season so far. All the stories and concepts are wonderful as always, even if a few of them feel somewhat derivative, which is not a problem in and of itself, just look at Season 2's ""The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit"" two-parter which gave us some great Alien-esque thrills!For me, the most disappointing story of Season 3 was one I couldn't wait to see, ""Daleks in Manhattan/Evolution of the Daleks."" The story concept is great, possibly one of the most ambitious to date, unfortunately the execution fell very short indeed. To save themselves we saw the ""Cult of Skaro"" perform an Emergency Temporal Shift when the Doctor opened the doorway between Earth and Parallel Earth at the end of Doomsday, for one last time. We then jump to 1930's New York and the construction of the Empire State Building, and who should be behind the project but everyone's favorite homicidal pepper-pots. There're some truly wonderful visuals in this story; there's something about the 30's Art Deco look and the new blinged-out Daleks that's just perfect, and the production team did a great job of invoking the look, feel, and sound, of Depression Era New York.From an army of untold millions the Dalek race had been reduced to just four. Teetering on the brink of extinction they came up with a radical, some would say ""sacrilegious,"" plan to not only save themselves, but to breed a new Dalek army. Working in secret they kidnapped the destitute, down-and-outs, the homeless, the unwanted, and fused human DNA with their own. These Dalek/Human hybrids are empty shells, waiting for the spark of life to be introduced, and it's here that the Empire State Building comes into play. The building is going to be the conductor for a massive blast of Gamma radiation emanating from the Sun as part of an enormous Solar Flare, waking the new Dalek army. But Dalek Sec, the leader of the Cult of Skaro, has an even more extreme plan in mind; ""The Children of Skaro"" he says, ""must once more walk outside the Shell!"" He plans to physically join with a Human host, thus creating a true Dalek/Human hybrid, and a creature that the others will surely view as an abomination!Didn't I say this story was ambitious?!?!?! When Sec let the others know what he intended to do I almost had to change my underwear, I was THAT excited! LOL! But oh, the horror... when the hybrid - which I immediately dubbed ""Hat-Sec!"" - was revealed, I was suddenly transported back to the bad old days of rubber monsters, cardboard sets, and cheesy FX! And even though the rest of the story, and it's final resolution, was excitingly, even thrillingly told, poor old Hat-Sec sucked the life out of it for me!But hey, it's not all-bad, remember that 5 Star rating! From here on in the stories really start to excel, ""The Lazarus Experiment"" is Who's take onThe Fly, and also served to introduce us to Martha's less than perfect family. ""42"" is an excitingly told ""countdown to disaster"" type tale, with more Alien-type thrills, a touch of Danny BoylesSunshine, and even a smidgen ofEvent Horizonthrown in for good measure!The last 6 episodes of the series are simply stunning, and are, quite frankly, worth the price of admission all by themselves! ""Human Nature/Family Of Blood"" has the Doctor on the run from a group of aliens who want to harness his ability to regenerate. Hiding out in pre-WWI England the Doctor ""becomes"" Human by downloading his Time Lord consciousness into a fob watch, and Martha is tasked with protecting him at all costs. The final lines of the episode, ""They shall not grow old as we who are left grow old/Age shall not wither them nor the years condemn/At the going down of the sun and in the morning/We shall remember them,"" (from ""For the Fallen"" by Laurence Binyon, a commemorative poem written for those who lost their lives in WWI) is especially moving when seen in the context of the story.The next story ""Blink"" barely has the Doctor or Martha in it at all, and yet is, without a doubt, one of the most imaginative, inventive, and scary episodes of all the new seasons to date... ""Beware the Weeping Angels!!!""This then leads us into the three-episode finale, ""Utopia/The Sound Of Drums/Last Of The Time Lords,"" which is quite simply magnificent! A new/old favorite returns and travels with the Doctor and Martha to the End Of Time itself, where an even older nemesis is reborn! And even if the ending itself is somewhat weak, even contrived (as is Martha's almost immediate attraction to the Doctor), as many have said, this is still a worthy and emotional conclusion to the season!!! HIGHLY recommended... even with ""Hat-Sec!"" LOL!",5,Oi!

What makes this a `meh' season instead of a `yeah' is being debated in all the reviews posted for this DVD set, but my take is that this season, though sometimes soaring, more often that not maintained a holding pattern that sometimes dipped into the kind of flavorful mediocrity you sometimes see in the kinds of series that get helmed by producers who are more interested in playing it safe and being PC rather than trying to tell a good story.  Not to take anything away from Freema Agyeman, whose on-screen presence as Martha Jones was certainly no complaint to these eyes, but at the end of the day, Martha was more cardboard than substance--take away her fawning love for the doctor and the fact (as one reviewer astutely observed) that she really doesn't display much medical knowledge despite being very close to being a professional doctor, and what's left?  This is not to say that the season didn't have its moments that were sheer transcendence!  The Shakespeare Code is about the best episode from any of the seasons, and Utopia does what good science fiction is supposed to do, namely blow your mind and leave it melting for more.  Too bad that Shakespeare was followed by such an utterly lame episode as Gridlock--people spending years on end trapped inside a car on a highway??  Right.  The two-parter of the Doctor hiding out as a human seemed like a good idea, but petered out pathetically:  that alien clan seemed about as malevolent as smiley-faced field mice and didn't exactly justify the Doctor disguising himself; plus, that whole siege/defense of the boys' school (for God and country and whatever) at the climax of the two-parter seemed very bizarre and out of character, both for the Doctor (yes, I know he had his little amnesia...) and the series as a whole.  The Master story arc started out brilliantly, but degenerated into near lunacy, largely thanks to the producers' decision to portray the Master as maniacal and unbalanced.  Blink, of course, was the gimmick story of the season, whereby the main characters are sidelined and the nobodies get to have their day--it is, however, well-written and the whole idea of the `quantum locked' statues is spun and told very nicely.  I personally wasn't sure what to make of The Runaway Bride Christmas special.  I liked the character of Donna, because she was anti-everything that came before:  not so easy on the eyes, a very annoying voice and manner, but also very shrewd and level-headed.  In the end, Series 3 is what it is-some will worship it as the end all be all, and others, like myself, will react with a dispassionate ""meh"".  What this series is, and continues to be however, is brazenly overpriced, which was fine for the first 2 seasons, because they were sterling, but this one . . . . .  better wait for the mark-down on eBay.",3,"The ""meh"" season.",1228435200,"12 5, 2008",2008,2954,"['3rd', 'season', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'not', 'entirely', 'bad', 'say', 'strongest', 'best', 'season', 'just', 'plain', 'being', 'crass', 'What', 'meh', 'season', 'instead', 'yeah', 'being', 'debated', 'reviews', 'posted', 'DVD', 'set', 'take', 'season', 'sometimes', 'soaring', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'maintained', 'holding', 'pattern', 'sometimes', 'dipped', 'kind', 'flavorful', 'mediocrity', 'sometimes', 'see', 'kinds', 'series', 'get', 'helmed', 'producers', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'playing', 'safe', 'being', 'PC', 'rather', 'trying', 'tell', 'good', 'story', 'Not', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'Freema', 'Agyeman', 'on-screen', 'presence', 'Martha', 'Jones', 'was', 'certainly', 'no', 'complaint', 'eyes', 'end', 'day', 'Martha', 'was', 'more', 'cardboard', 'substance', 'take', 'away', 'fawning', 'love', 'doctor', 'fact', 'one', 'reviewer', 'astutely', 'observed', 'really', ""n't"", 'display', 'much', 'medical', 'knowledge', 'being', 'very', 'close', 'being', 'professional', 'doctor', 'what', 'left', 'not', 'say', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'moments', 'were', 'sheer', 'transcendence', 'Shakespeare', 'Code', 'best', 'episode', 'seasons', 'Utopia', 'what', 'good', 'science', 'fiction', 'supposed', 'do', 'namely', 'blow', 'mind', 'leave', 'melting', 'more', 'Too', 'bad', 'Shakespeare', 'was', 'followed', 'such', 'utterly', 'lame', 'episode', 'Gridlock', 'people', 'spending', 'years', 'end', 'trapped', 'car', 'highway', 'Right', 'two-parter', 'Doctor', 'hiding', 'out', 'human', 'seemed', 'good', 'idea', 'petered', 'out', 'pathetically', 'clan', 'seemed', 'as', 'malevolent', 'smiley-faced', 'field', 'mice', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'justify', 'Doctor', 'disguising', 'whole', 'siege/defense', 'boys', 'school', 'God', 'country', 'climax', 'two-parter', 'seemed', 'very', 'bizarre', 'character', 'Doctor', 'yes', 'know', 'had', 'little', 'amnesia', 'series', 'whole', 'Master', 'story', 'arc', 'started', 'out', 'brilliantly', 'degenerated', 'lunacy', 'largely', 'thanks', 'producers', 'decision', 'portray', 'Master', 'maniacal', 'unbalanced', 'Blink', 'course', 'was', 'gimmick', 'story', 'season', 'whereby', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'sidelined', 'nobodies', 'get', 'have', 'day', 'however', 'well-written', 'whole', 'idea', 'quantum', 'locked', 'statues', 'spun', 'told', 'very', 'nicely', 'personally', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'Runaway', 'Bride', 'Christmas', 'special', 'liked', 'character', 'Donna', 'was', 'anti-everything', 'came', 'not', 'so', 'easy', 'eyes', 'very', 'annoying', 'voice', 'manner', 'also', 'very', 'shrewd', 'level-headed', 'end', 'Series', '3', 'what', 'is-some', 'will', 'worship', 'end', 'be', 'others', 'will', 'react', 'dispassionate', 'meh', 'What', 'series', 'be', 'however', 'brazenly', 'overpriced', 'was', 'fine', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'were', 'sterling', 'one', 'better', 'wait', 'mark-down', 'eBay']",N/A

1082507,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000RL5H6Y,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 3]","With equal measures of preposterousness and the epic, the new Dr. Who wraps up its 3rd season.  David Tennant is back for another go around as the doctor, with a new companion, med student Martha Jones.  There's a new season's-long arc involving the mysterious politician Harold Saxon (though old-school fans may have solved the secret from the first mention).  Several intriguing plot arcs are developed, and iconic villains return.  While there are definite signs of story-recycling, there's enough originality to keep new fans coming back, while older fans will settle into even those re-done episodes like a comfy shoe.  The best part of the season, a greater willingness to center stories on supporting characters, developing the original's show great charm of writing stories based on complex guest characters never seen before or intended to reappear.Warning though - while the show keeps the whimsy of prior seasons (and the original series), season 3 is definitely darker than season's past.""Smith and Jones"" has the Doctor acquire a new companion - Martha Jones while hunting (and being hunted by) aliens in a London hospital inconveniently transported to the Moon.  This is one of those episodes in which the sci-fi is just a convenient backdrop to the Doctor's interactions with his new companion.""Shakespeare Code"", a sci-fi riff on ""Shakespeare in Love"" and easily one of the few great outright fantasy stories of the series.  A diversion to Elizabethan England reveals a plot by powerful aliens to use some couplets from a new play by Shakespeare to...uh, well, why spoil that?""Gridlock"" returns the Doctor to ""New New York"", last seen in last season's ""New Earth"".  It's a great story based on a conceit that's as funny as it is scary.  In short, New Yorkers of the distant future are trapped in an eternal commute.  Horrible traffic and a guest shot by ""The Face of Boe"" highlight this fun romp.A two-part story pits the Doctor against Daleks stranded in depression-era NY.  This story could have done with a third episode, as it touches on many great ideas packed into too-little running time.""The Lazarus Experiment"" and ""42"" are filler stories of the sort familiar to the series.  ""Lazarus"" has the doctor confront a scientist who subjects himself to revolutionary genetic experiments having unexpected and horrific consequences.  It's also a good opportunity for Doc to meet his companion's family, seeing how much fun we had last season with Pete and Jackie.  ""42"" has Doc fighting against time (42 minutes to be about precise) aboard a doomed spaceship, all the while being dogged by apparently possessed members of the crew - basically ""Ark in Space"" and ""Impossible Planet"".When is ""The Doctor"" not himself?  When he's a schoolmaster in a proper English school in 1913.  He's on the run from the malevolent ""Family of Blood"", an alien clan desperately in need of his Timelord energies.  Why the Doctor runs rather than battles these aliens is revealed in a darkly funny twist ending, one that highlights how adult the show has become.  More interesting is the fact that John Smith has only the barest memories of being the Doctor, and must choose between these two possible existences.Remember ""Love and Monsters"" from last season?  Howzabout ""random Shoes"" from ""Torchwood""?  Nobody else did, or maybe Tennant & Agyeman just had too-tight filming schedules - so we get ""Blink"", this great story of killer statues told entirely from the point of non-recurring characters.  The Doctor has been stranded in 1969 and has sent messages across time to the one person who can help him.  The enemies?  Statues that are ""quantum locked"".  They are only frozen when being looked at.  Otherwise, they are super fast.  Can you look without blinking?A three-ep arc rounds out the season, reuniting Doc with one of his greatest enemies, who turns out to be (among other things) Harold Saxon, GB's insane new PM.  From the end of the universe to present-day London (and beyond), the Doctor will pursue then battle the enemy, at times suffering embarrassing reversals.  There are revelations both dispiriting and inspiring as the Doctor reunites with Captain Harkness (John Barrowman) of Torchwood, and realizes the import of his last message from ""The Face of Boe"".This was a great season, with highpoints easily compensating for slack moments.  The series may sometimes disappoint but manages to bring you back.  As Martha Jones, Freema Agyeman is more than just another incarnation of Rose Tyler, and she manages to find a new chemistry with David Tennant.  By any measure, a great season.",4,"More madcap, time-traveling fun",1194480000,"11 8, 2007",2007,4602,"['equal', 'measures', 'preposterousness', 'epic', 'new', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'up', '3rd', 'season', 'David', 'Tennant', 'back', 'go', 'around', 'doctor', 'new', 'companion', 'med', 'student', 'Martha', 'Jones', 'new', ""season's-long"", 'arc', 'involving', 'mysterious', 'politician', 'Harold', 'Saxon', 'old-school', 'fans', 'may', 'have', 'solved', 'secret', 'first', 'mention', 'Several', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'arcs', 'are', 'developed', 'iconic', 'villains', 'return', 'are', 'definite', 'signs', 'story-recycling', 'enough', 'originality', 'keep', 'new', 'fans', 'coming', 'back', 'older', 'fans', 'will', 'settle', 'even', 're-done', 'episodes', 'comfy', 'shoe', 'best', 'part', 'season', 'greater', 'willingness', 'center', 'stories', 'supporting', 'characters', 'developing', 'original', 'show', 'great', 'charm', 'writing', 'stories', 'based', 'complex', 'guest', 'characters', 'never', 'seen', 'intended', 'reappear.Warning', 'show', 'whimsy', 'prior', 'seasons', 'original', 'series', 'season', '3', 'definitely', 'darker', 'season', 'past', 'Smith', 'Jones', 'Doctor', 'acquire', 'new', 'companion', 'Martha', 'Jones', 'hunting', 'being', 'hunted', 'aliens', 'London', 'hospital', 'inconveniently', 'transported', 'Moon', 'one', 'episodes', 'sci-fi', 'just', 'convenient', 'backdrop', 'Doctor', 'interactions', 'new', 'companion', 'Shakespeare', 'Code', 'sci-fi', 'riff', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'easily', 'one', 'few', 'great', 'outright', 'fantasy', 'stories', 'series', 'diversion', 'Elizabethan', 'England', 'plot', 'powerful', 'aliens', 'use', 'couplets', 'new', 'play', 'Shakespeare', 'uh', 'well', 'why', 'spoil', 'Gridlock', 'Doctor', 'New', 'New', 'York', 'last', 'seen', 'last', 'season', 'New', 'Earth', 'great', 'story', 'based', 'conceit', 'as', 'funny', 'scary', 'short', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'distant', 'future', 'are', 'trapped', 'eternal', 'commute', 'Horrible', 'traffic', 'guest', 'shot', 'Face', 'Boe', 'highlight', 'fun', 'two-part', 'story', 'Doctor', 'Daleks', 'stranded', 'depression-era', 'NY', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'third', 'episode', 'many', 'great', 'ideas', 'packed', 'too-little', 'running', 'time', 'Lazarus', 'Experiment', '42', 'are', 'filler', 'stories', 'sort', 'familiar', 'series', 'Lazarus', 'doctor', 'scientist', 'who', 'revolutionary', 'genetic', 'experiments', 'having', 'unexpected', 'horrific', 'consequences', 'also', 'good', 'opportunity', 'Doc', 'meet', 'companion', 'family', 'seeing', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'had', 'last', 'season', 'Pete', 'Jackie', '42', 'Doc', 'fighting', 'time', '42', 'minutes', 'be', 'precise', 'doomed', 'spaceship', 'while', 'being', 'dogged', 'apparently', 'possessed', 'members', 'crew', 'basically', 'Ark', 'Space', 'Impossible', 'Planet', '.When', 'Doctor', 'not', 'When', 'schoolmaster', 'proper', 'English', 'school', '1913', 'run', 'malevolent', 'Family', 'Blood', 'alien', 'clan', 'desperately', 'need', 'Timelord', 'energies', 'Why', 'Doctor', 'rather', 'battles', 'aliens', 'revealed', 'darkly', 'funny', 'twist', 'ending', 'one', 'how', 'adult', 'show', 'become', 'More', 'interesting', 'fact', 'John', 'Smith', 'only', 'barest', 'memories', 'being', 'Doctor', 'must', 'choose', 'two', 'possible', 'existences.Remember', 'Love', 'Monsters', 'last', 'season', 'random', 'Shoes', 'Torchwood', 'Nobody', 'else', 'did', 'maybe', 'Tennant', 'Agyeman', 'just', 'had', 'too-tight', 'filming', 'schedules', 'so', 'get', 'Blink', 'great', 'story', 'killer', 'statues', 'told', 'entirely', 'point', 'non-recurring', 'characters', 'Doctor', 'been', 'stranded', '1969', 'sent', 'messages', 'time', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'enemies', 'Statues', 'are', 'quantum', 'locked', 'are', 'only', 'frozen', 'when', 'being', 'looked', 'Otherwise', 'are', 'super', 'fast', 'Can', 'look', 'blinking', 'three-ep', 'arc', 'out', 'season', 'reuniting', 'Doc', 'one', 'greatest', 'enemies', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'other', 'things', 'Harold', 'Saxon', 'GB', 'insane', 'new', 'PM', 'end', 'universe', 'present-day', 'London', 'Doctor', 'will', 'pursue', 'then', 'battle', 'enemy', 'times', 'suffering', 'embarrassing', 'reversals', 'are', 'revelations', 'dispiriting', 'inspiring', 'Doctor', 'Captain', 'Harkness', 'John', 'Barrowman', 'Torchwood', 'import', 'last', 'message', 'Face', 'Boe', '.This', 'was', 'great', 'season', 'highpoints', 'easily', 'compensating', 'slack', 'moments', 'series', 'may', 'sometimes', 'disappoint', 'manages', 'bring', 'back', 'Martha', 'Jones', 'Freema', 'Agyeman', 'more', 'just', 'incarnation', 'Rose', 'Tyler', 'find', 'new', 'chemistry', 'David', 'Tennant', 'measure', 'great', 'season']",N/A

Davies' four part reboot of The Doctor, Davies NEEDED Billie Piper's Rose Tyler to disappear. Rose had become such an integral part of the first two seasons that she had to disappear if only to allow David Tennant the center stage that The Doctor should have had to begin with.  This isn't to say that the stunning Freema Agyeman as Martha Jones is secondary to Tennant through this set--far from it, if anything.  But it's the third season--Tennant's second as our favorite TimeLord--where he begins to define the parameters on his take of The Doctor, and elevate himself into the Tom Baker-level.  Tennant's Ten is his usual speak-at-the-speed-of-thought, cheeky and charming Doctor, but also shows a darker edge in the two-part stories--the ""Daleks in Manhattan/Evolution of The Daleks"" storyline and the ""Human Nature/The Family of Blood"" tale.  Tennant starts to give a weight to the role...that many didn't see coming.It would be remiss to not mention the episode that kicks off this set--""The Runaway Bride""--because of Catherine Tate's introduction as the brassy Donna Noble.  Tate's comedic skills come into play in the episode, and Donna--who as we know, has some part of a future with The Doctor--for all of her abrasive nature, seems to have a good feel for the nature of The Doctor.Agyeman's Martha Jones really has a whirlwind time with The Doctor--with most of their adventures really falling over about a four-day period (Such is the nature of time in this series).  Yes, she falls harder for The Doctor than expected; and this has been a sore point with some reviewers...but I don't see this as any different than Rose or Sarah Jane among the companions.There really isn't a bad episode among the bunch--the aforementioned two-parters, the magnificent ""Blink"", the three parter at the end of the season--""Utopia/The Sound Of Drums/The Last Of The Time Lords"", in which John Barrowman's Jack Harkness comes back into working with The Doctor against The Doctor's old enemy The Master--played with a lot of snarl by Derek Jacobi and John Simm--becomes Britain's Prime Minister (and eventual Master...of The World...).Again, the sparking point in watching this season is watching Tennant--much of his own personality starts to shine through and adapt itself to The Doctor, and it seems that the character adapts to him as well.  It point up to why, as we're into 2010 and Matt Smith takes over for Tennant, David will be missed at times in this role, and the role might miss him as well.

I am hooked however ever since the pilot episode where we met the Doctor and Rose.Speaking of Rose, I never felt the new companion Martha fit the bill - and it wasn't just because the new actress isn't as good as Billie Piper (though that is extremely true, Ms. Piper possesses far more emotional range, trust me I used to study with one of the top acting coaches in the U.S.).  The other significant problem is that the writers never truly integrated Martha into the storyline - nor did they fully define her character.  Those things weren't the new actresses fault, really.The episode ""Blink"", for all the hype and fanatical praise it seems to be garnering, is half-cool.  I wouldn't place it anywhere near the best of Season 1 and 2, mind you.  The concept is fine, but I was uncomfortable with certain aspects that I don't really want to into (let's just say I detected a distinct air of misogyny creeping in that was disturbing).The three-parter that concludes the season - without revealing anything - really peters out.  The first of the three is excellent, quite possibly the best episode of the season.  The second of the three is just okay, while the third of the three really gets bogus in some ways.

I am in the middle of the Dalek two parter and I have never seen a heretofore solid program collapse into rubbish this fast. It is like the Sylvester McCoy years with a bigger budget.  I am guessing that Davies---feeling his oats after a successful previous two seasons---decided to go all wild with the politics. Except for THE RUNAWAY BRIDE--the only good story thus far---every ep has bludgeoned the viewer with both excessive racial and Gay agenda politics. It is practically by rote. Martha Jones is the Doctor's first Black companion------as the eps make a point of dwelling on every ep. Her sole reason for existence seems to be the Doctor's BLACK companion and little else.  Davies' sense of history is goofy as well.  Besides Shakespearean England being apparently overrun with Blacks(Is this a result of the Time War rewriting history?)we learn the Daleks built the Empire State building. We get a bizarre attack on Herbert Hoover. The people rise up led by an accentless--not even a New York one--Black man and his southerner cracker(with the appropriate accent) Gay friend. Every ep has a Gay moment usually with the Doctor flirting with--first Shakespeare and then the Southern cracker. The stories are pretty silly and repetious. The Shakespeare code is retread of the first season Dickens story. Gridlock a retread of the first New New York story.  The Face of Boes BIG revelation is that the Doctor is not the last Time Lord--perhaps the most anticlimatic SHOCKING REVELATION in history.I simply do not get it. It is like once Rose Tyler left, Davies was at a loss what to do or perhaps he felt that if he simply trotted out the propaganda he would not have to deliver a good story.  I really hope things get better after the part two of the Dalek story which I have no hope for.

It feels natural, especially if you consider the Doctor an asexual being.Plus, Martha herself is a stronger and intelligent character.  The writers and producers have used her to great effect and she is a joy to watch.  Okay, she's gorgeous too and Freema knows how to act, but it's her characterization Martha that has won me over.Episodes include:""Smith and Jones"" - series 3 opener and character introduction""The Shakespeare Code"" - AWESOME episode featuring Shakespeare and contains the first set pieces dealing with racism...  plus, it's the best pseudo-historical made to date.  A terrific piece.""Gridlock"" - a bit disappointing, but not terribly bad.  The Macra seemed underused and I couldn't care less about the plight of some of the characters, which felt shoehorned in.""Daleks in Manhattan""/""Evolution of the Daleks"" - it waffles near the end and some would argue the Daleks feel shoehorned in to what is otherwise a story with depth and really good set pieces, but it's got enough merit to be enjoyed.""The Lazarus Experiment"" - a bit better and it introduces a character you need to keep an eye on.""42"" - if you recall the classic series story ""Planet of Evil"", ""42"" seems to be reminiscent of ""Planet of Evil"" yet seems to be a lot more consistent.  And creepy.  Defintely underrated.""Human Nature""/""The Family of Blood"" - it's the best of the entire new series and then some.  Paul Cornell tops himself here with the plot, its resolution, the period setting, the cruelty of racism...  this is perfection, personified and alone is worthy of the set's purchase.""Blink"" - another top notch entry from Steven Moffat.""Utopia"" - Russel T Davies' best WHO script, ever.  Plus, there's an awesome performance from Derek Jacobi.  But the story itself is impeccable as well.""The Sound of Drums""/""The Last of the Time Lords"" - it's a bit campy, plays up emotions rather than providing rudimentary coherence, and unusual for the new series as it ends on a rather happy note, but logic is thrown out the door just to wrap up some of the plot points and that's just bad.  Plus, how the Doctor treats his adversary here directly contradicts how he's dealt with other nasty wrongdoers who want to kill everybody.  The implied reason is that they are of the same race, which instantly makes people ask if the Doctor is being a racist, or at the very least working with double standards?)But all in all?

1082541,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000RL5H6Y,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[7, 9]","The third season of Doctor Who had a lot of changes. First we get a temporary companion a bride that gets transported to the TARDIS as she's walking down the aisle, a new traveling companion Martha Jones, the return of the Daleks, Captain Jack returns and so does the Doctor's most powerful adversary the Master. All of this happens in 13 episodes plus the Christmas special ""The Runaway Bride"".SOME SPOILERS AHEAD:In ""The Runaway Bride"" a woman (Catherine Tate)is mysteriously transported to the TARDIS in mid-flight. The Doctor must discover how she got there and return her to her wedding which is already in progress. More importantly he must discover what is so special about this woman that she should just appear on the TARDIS.Still reeling from the loss of Rose, the Doctor (David Tennant) is the walking wounded when he first meets Dr. Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman) in a hospital that has been transported to the moon. The Judoon an alien police force for hire have isolated the hospital as they track down a plasma vampire hiding there.The strongest episodes outside of these two are ""Blink"" a creepy episode that involves creepy statuary that move and attack people when they aren't looking. The three part story arc involving the Master's return ""Utopia"", ""Vote Saxon"" and ""Last of the Time Lords"". The former is little more than an excuse to reintroduce the Master (John Simm). The Doctor, Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) and Martha go to the end of time and find a small group of humans trying to escape to Utopia a planet at the other end of the Galaxy. They are dependent upon Professor Yana (Derek Jacobi) in figuring out how to launch their rocket.In ""Vote Saxon"" and ""Last of the Time Lords"" the Master escapes taking the TARDIS to modern day England where he masquerades as Prime Minister Harold Saxon. He uses his position to enslave the Earth and capture the Doctor.The weakest episodes for me were the two stories involving the Daleks set in 1930's New York. It's enjoyable for the period d&eacute;cor, performances and the action sequences but suffers from some silly elements that undermine the show. The whole mystery involving the ""Pig Men"" just didn't work for me. ""Gridlock"" reintroduces the Face of Bo (and we finally find out about the relationship between the Doctor and this enigmatic character). Even the weakest episodes though have something to enjoy about them.END OF SPOILERS:The first season looked good but the blacks weren't very solid. This set looks much better with solid blacks, accurate colors and detail.The audio is still problematic however. The 5.1 mix allows the music to often drown out the dialogue (unless you crank up one speaker at the expense of the others). This has been a common complaint for the previous two sets as well. I'm surprised the BBC hasn't fixed this issue as it has been a common complaint among those who have purchased the show.Once again the BBC comes through with some terrific special features for this set. We get a commentary track on every episode (many of them featuring star David Tennant and writer/producer Russell Davies). Curiously, Freema Agyeman who plays Martha only appears on the final episode of the set in a commentary with John Barrowman.We also get ""David's Video Diaries"" which takes us behind-the-scenes on various episodes throughout the third season. It's a nice ""informal' peak into the production of the show. This crops up in three parts on separate discs for episodes including ""The Runaway Bride"" and ""The Lazarus Experiment"".""Music and Monsters"" was a special that the BBC did on the music of Doctor Who hosted by David Tennant and featuring brief interviews/appearances by various cast members from the three season revival.""Doctor Who: Confidential"" the BBC TV series that takes fans behind-the-scenes over the last three years appears solely on the final disc. These are edited versions of the programs that appeared on each Sunday. It's narrated by Anthony Head (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") and features interviews with cast and creative crew for the show.We also get teasers for various episodes, outtakes/deleted scenes and previews for other BBC on DVD TV shows. Included as well is a booklet with a brief description of each episode, credits and a brief introduction written by David Tennat.Overall the third season was a strong one with a number of terrific episodes. Even the weaker episodes had something to recommend them. As always the set impresses with the special features. The image quality is improved over previous sets but the audio is a bit more problematic with an oddly overpowering 5.1 mix.My only complaint is the packaging. It's nicely designed but my set wouldn't hold any of the DVD's on the bottom. It appears that the plastic holders that are supposed to hold the discs secure are defective for the entire set. I don't know if this is a widespread problem or not but just be aware of it as the discs will fall out and can get scratched when you open the set.",4,The Doctor gets a new companion and faces an old
