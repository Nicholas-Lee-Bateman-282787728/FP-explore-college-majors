This straight to DVD release was marketed very well in its trailers on the Masters of Horror DVDs. Don't believe it!The story isn't all that horrible (but it is more than a little ""preachy"" at the end), but the execution of it is just abominable! The director is also the head writer and he really does NOT have the gift of dialog. It is hackneyed and overwrought. Rather than letting the action tell the story, he feels it necessary to overwrite the dialog to supplement the action. There are all sorts of loose ends and missing plot points.Christine Taylor is the lead in the film and she can't carry it. She isn't a bad actress but she's not a good one either. Shane Brolly and Jerry McConnell are the male leads and while both are atractive, neither one is a great actor. (Frankly, I still marvel at O'Connell's weight loss all these years later - how the heck did he do it and what does he do to stay so darned lean now?).The special effects are okay, but the story and the film just drags on and on and on.

982112,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B000F3UA84,Joshua Koppel,"[11, 12]",A young woman has a fear of hospitals due some terrible thing she did when she was younger.  She still has terrible nightmares about being in a hospital.  Now she is faced with a relationship that is developing to the next stage when the two are in an auto accident.  He is taken by an ambulance to a hospital.  She is not allowed to ride with him and they do not tell her which hospital.  She doesn't realize the omission until after she takes a cab to the closest hospital.  She then meets the driver of the other vehicle.  He tells a similar story.  Together they try and find her partner and his sister.  Their search of all of the hospitals turns up nothing.Meanwhile her boyfriend is in a strange hospital and the staff are the ones from her nightmares.  He realizes things are not right and tries to learn more and get out of the hospital despite the warnings from others in his ward.  He witnesses strange and terrifying things.  But as he tries to get out his girlfriend is following unorthodox methods and learns about an old hospital that burned down before she was born.  She is told she can find it if she really wants to.  The two paths converge as she has to face her fears and their causes before she can locate her boyfriend and help him.  The end is unexpected and help explains much of the strangeness in the earlier parts of the film.This is a film you have to stick with.  At first I though it was very poorly written.  Take the accident for instance.  There are no police.  There is no exchange of information.  The participants just walk away and leave their vehicles behind.  But this and many other strange things will make sense if you watch the whole movie.  But you will have to put the bits together.  There are no replays of scenes from different angles like in The Sixth Sense or Hide And Seek.  But if you do stick with it you will discover what the film is really all about and it really works quite well.  But it is not what you would really expect from the trailer.  I personally think it winds up being better that they trailer lets on.

982114,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000F3UA84,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","Like most of you who have seen this 2006 horror film I checked it out because the trailer for it was popping up on a lot of other DVDs that I was watching.  The implication was that there is a room in this particular hospital where the doctors and nurses do evil, wicked, bad and nasty things to patients.  How that is the just the ground floor for this tottering Jenga of a horror film.  Our heroine is Amy (Christine Taylor), who not only has nightmares about hospitals, she is having nightmares about the hospital in this movies.  When she is not asleep and having nightmares Amy is a schoolteacher with one young student who makes weird comments and a tendency to look at people and suddenly see them as demons.  Then Amy and her boyfriend Nick (Shane Brolly) are in an accident.  A crowd stands and stares but offers no help and then an ambulance shows up to take Nick to the hospital.  The problem is that when Amy tries to find Nick, he is in none of the hospitals in town.  No, poor Nick is in the hospital that Amy has been seeing in her nightmares.""Room 6"" is one of those horror movies where they seem to be throwing in everything but the kitchen sink, and then that hits you smack in the head too.  You have Nick in the hospital from hell, which could be enough to sustain a horror movie plot, but Amy is seeing things and doubting her sanity.  Not only that, but she has a deep dark secret in her past, and there is a back story about St. Rosemary's Hospital, which burnt down many years ago.  There is a little girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) with a touch of the supernatural, naked nurses finding fun things to do with blood, and Jerry O'Connell in the role of the only person who believes anything that Amy is saying but who is clearly too good to be true.  There was so much going on in this movie as the script by Mark A. Altman and director Michael Hurst (the team that brought us ""House of the Dead"" and ""House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim"") kept pouring it on, that it was not until the second appearance of the taxi driver (Billy Gardell) that I finally started to get a handle on what was really happening.You might enjoy ""Room 6"" more the second time through once you know how to ""read"" it properly.  You might not agree with the point of the story once you know what it is, but it does offer an explanation as to how all of the seemingly disparate elements in this film fit together, especially for people weaned on ""The Twilight Zone.""  On balance, I liked the scenes with Nick in the hospital more than those of Amy trying to find Nick, largely because every time she saw another demon it seemed more like a distraction that another piece of the puzzle.  The film does have a nice look, thanks to cinematographer Raymond Stella, who was the camera operator on ""Halloween"" and 59 episodes of ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer.""  For horror buffs there is a cameo by Kane Hodder (a.k.a. Jason), and the boiler room location used is the same one Wes Craven used for Freddy Krueger in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street.""  For DVD extras there is the trailer for ""Room 6"" and some other Anchor Bay releases, a 41-minute featurette ""Hospital From Hell,"" a decent enough commentary track from Hurst and Altman, and if you pop the disc in your DVD-rom drive you can read the film's screenplay.",3,There is a method to the madness of this tottering Jenga of a horror film,1183161600,"06 30, 2007",2007,3286,"['most', 'who', 'have', 'seen', '2006', 'horror', 'film', 'checked', 'out', 'trailer', 'was', 'popping', 'up', 'lot', 'other', 'DVDs', 'was', 'watching', 'implication', 'was', 'room', 'particular', 'hospital', 'where', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'do', 'evil', 'wicked', 'bad', 'nasty', 'things', 'patients', 'How', 'just', 'ground', 'floor', 'tottering', 'Jenga', 'horror', 'film', 'heroine', 'Amy', 'Christine', 'Taylor', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'nightmares', 'hospitals', 'having', 'nightmares', 'hospital', 'movies', 'When', 'not', 'asleep', 'having', 'nightmares', 'Amy', 'schoolteacher', 'one', 'young', 'student', 'who', 'weird', 'comments', 'tendency', 'look', 'people', 'suddenly', 'see', 'demons', 'Then', 'Amy', 'boyfriend', 'Nick', 'Shane', 'Brolly', 'are', 'accident', 'crowd', 'stands', 'stares', 'help', 'then', 'ambulance', 'up', 'take', 'Nick', 'hospital', 'problem', 'when', 'Amy', 'find', 'Nick', 'none', 'hospitals', 'town', 'No', 'poor', 'Nick', 'hospital', 'Amy', 'been', 'seeing', 'nightmares', 'Room', '6', 'one', 'horror', 'movies', 'where', 'seem', 'be', 'throwing', 'everything', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'then', 'hits', 'smack', 'head', 'too', 'have', 'Nick', 'hospital', 'hell', 'could', 'be', 'enough', 'sustain', 'horror', 'movie', 'plot', 'Amy', 'seeing', 'things', 'doubting', 'sanity', 'Not', 'only', 'deep', 'dark', 'secret', 'past', 'back', 'story', 'St.', 'Rosemary', 'Hospital', 'burnt', 'down', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'little', 'girl', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'touch', 'supernatural', 'naked', 'nurses', 'finding', 'fun', 'things', 'do', 'blood', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'role', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'anything', 'Amy', 'saying', 'who', 'clearly', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'movie', 'script', 'Mark', 'A.', 'Altman', 'director', 'Michael', 'Hurst', 'team', 'brought', 'House', 'Dead', 'House', 'Dead', '2', 'Dead', 'Aim', 'kept', 'pouring', 'was', 'not', 'second', 'appearance', 'taxi', 'driver', 'Billy', 'Gardell', 'finally', 'started', 'get', 'handle', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'happening.You', 'might', 'enjoy', 'Room', '6', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'once', 'know', 'how', 'read', 'properly', 'might', 'not', 'agree', 'point', 'story', 'once', 'know', 'what', 'offer', 'explanation', 'how', 'seemingly', 'disparate', 'elements', 'film', 'fit', 'together', 'especially', 'people', 'weaned', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'balance', 'liked', 'scenes', 'Nick', 'hospital', 'more', 'Amy', 'trying', 'find', 'Nick', 'largely', 'time', 'saw', 'demon', 'seemed', 'more', 'distraction', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'film', 'have', 'nice', 'look', 'thanks', 'cinematographer', 'Raymond', 'Stella', 'who', 'was', 'camera', 'operator', 'Halloween', '59', 'episodes', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'horror', 'buffs', 'cameo', 'Kane', 'Hodder', 'a.k.a', 'Jason', 'boiler', 'room', 'location', 'used', 'same', 'one', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'used', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'DVD', 'trailer', 'Room', '6', 'other', 'Anchor', 'Bay', '41-minute', 'featurette', 'Hospital', 'From', 'Hell', 'decent', 'enough', 'commentary', 'track', 'Hurst', 'Altman', 'pop', 'disc', 'DVD-rom', 'drive', 'can', 'read', 'film', 'screenplay']",Room 6

The paramedics come and take Nick and O'Connell's girlfriend in seperate ambulances to the St. Rosemary's Hospital. Taylor figures out that whoever took her boyfriend didnt take her to the hospital that they sent her to. Same thing goes for O'Connell with his girlfriend. So, they team up to try to find out where they are. Meanwhile at St. Rosemary's the doctors and the naughty nurses act weird and Brolly finds out some pretty horrible things. Seems like Brolly is in a place he shouldnt be. Taylor, Brolly and O'Connell are wasted bigtime here. No scares, no thrills, no nothing. A pretty forgettable horror movie.

Seems like something terrible happened when she was twelve.  That presents a problem when her hunky fiancee is injured in an automobile accident and is carted off via ambulance to St. Rosemary's Hospital.  Problem is, Taylor can't find her beau and she joins fellow crash victim Jerry O'Connell, whose sister vanished too.Shane Brolly (UNDERWORLD) plays the boyfriend, who is pretty stupid in the long run.  He never seems to notice the unusual hospital personnel, doesn't ask where his girlfriend is, doesn't act like he's concerned about the weird hospital..until it's too late.Ghostly happenings and some unusual camera techniques help the atmosphere, and for a low budget flick, ROOM 6 is worth a look.",4,"DON'T CHECK IN HERE, FOLKS",1149379200,"06 4, 2006",2006,1043,"['Compared', 'many', 'most', 'recent', 'horror', 'films', 'ROOM', '6', 'be', 'classic', 'many', 'flaws', 'Nonetheless', 'spooky', 'mood', ""a'la"", 'KINGDOM', 'HOSPITAL', 'performers', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'change.Christine', 'Taylor', 'role', 'scream', 'queen', 'nicely', 'playing', 'young', 'woman', 'unusual', 'phobia', 'hospitals', 'Seems', 'something', 'terrible', 'happened', 'when', 'was', 'twelve', 'problem', 'when', 'hunky', 'fiancee', 'injured', 'automobile', 'accident', 'carted', 'off', 'ambulance', 'St.', 'Rosemary', 'Hospital', 'Problem', 'Taylor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'beau', 'fellow', 'crash', 'victim', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'sister', 'vanished', 'too.Shane', 'Brolly', 'UNDERWORLD', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'long', 'run', 'never', 'notice', 'unusual', 'hospital', 'personnel', ""n't"", 'ask', 'where', 'girlfriend', ""n't"", 'act', 'concerned', 'weird', 'hospital..until', 'too', 'late.Ghostly', 'happenings', 'unusual', 'camera', 'techniques', 'help', 'atmosphere', 'low', 'budget', 'flick', 'ROOM', '6', 'look']",Room 6

Marcia Brady is in a car accident with her boyfriend and weird things begin to happen. First no one is helping them get out and no one seems to care very much. An ambulance arrives and takes the boyfriend away, but has not told miss Clueless what hospital there taking him to. She goes to the local hospital but he was not taken there. She meets the Sliders guy who was in the other car and he can't find his sister either in the same situation. So they try to locate them, only to discover they have been taken to a hospital that burnt down years ago for being devil worshipers or something.Like I said, if that sounded interesting, beleive me, thats all there is thats any good. The movie is completely stupid and makes no sense. She sees all of these burnt up monsters type of people who keep telling her she won't get her boyfriend back, then the scenes in the hospital with the boyfriend are just.... *cringe* what are they supposed to be? Demons, Zombies, vampires? Yet at no point in the movie did i feel anyone was really in any danger or something bad would happen to them. Just a few weird scenes here and there that make no sense.I guess the writer thought it would be scary to see blood sucking nurses in the shadows, but they have a lot to learn about the actual viewers of these things, cause with no tie ins, or explanations, some kind of gore factor, then these movies get rated low... very low.There is much more I could say about the scenes that don't make sense, but I wanna point out the title. Room 6.... r66m 6... was there any point in this movie they referred to the ward as room 666? It hardly seemed like a scary room. The movie should have been, ""St Marys Hospital, and it's un-spooky spooks""To have nurses and doctors who you hear are this and that and are going to do these bad things, you hardly feel entertained when they act normal, keep backing away from the table, talk about golf and then say calmly, ""we should burn in this fire, it's where we belong"" ... those who have seen this will know what I mean, where is the suspence factor in waiting for something to happen, needing something to happen, or there should have been something happen to improve the movie, and there just standing around smiling? They don't have demon faces, no odd surgery, no devilish thoughts, no nothing...ZZzzzzzzzzzzzz... and they just stand back when Barbie runs in to save her boyfriend and walk him calmly out of the hospital to live happily ever after.P.S: For those obsessed Jason fans, Kane Hodders appearance in this movie isn't worth &^%$.
