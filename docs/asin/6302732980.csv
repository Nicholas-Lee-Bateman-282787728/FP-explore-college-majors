330728,A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST,6302732980,Best Of All,"[4, 4]","Phar Lap, ""The Red Terror,"" remains a larger-than-life hero in Australia and New Zealand some 75 years after his mysterious death on a private ranch in California.Writer David Williamson and director Simon Wincer combine for a winning perfecta in staying as close as possible to the real life story of this superhorse.The movie was nominated in 1983 for eight Australian Film Institute awards, winning a trio; Best Achievement in Editing, Best Achievement in Sound and Best Original Music Score. The Motion Picture Sound Editors (USA) presented the film with a 1985 Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing - Foreign Feature.Actors Tom Burlinson (Tommy Woodcock), Martin Vaughan (trainer Harry Telford) and Ron Leibman (sportsman David J. Davis) are the team which does not give up on the then unknown racer and ultimately are rewarded with a champion for the ages.Phar Lap, 1926-1932, won 37 of 51 races, captured the 1930 Melbourne Cup and was poised to take on the best in North America in a 1932 tour, which started with a convincing win in the Agua Caliente (Mexico) Handicap.The swirling controversy surrounding Phar Lap's death on April 5, 1932, has never been solved, though the theories range from a deliberate poisoning by organized crime figures, an accidental poisoning due to a pesticide on grass he had eaten or a stomach condition. The movie hints at solving what many fans felt then and now was murder.This is a compelling story, which - like Phar Lap - stands the test of time.",5,"A Legend, A True Star",1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,1494,"['Phar', 'Lap', 'Red', 'Terror', 'larger-than-life', 'hero', 'Australia', 'New', 'Zealand', '75', 'years', 'mysterious', 'death', 'private', 'ranch', 'California.Writer', 'David', 'Williamson', 'director', 'Simon', 'Wincer', 'combine', 'winning', 'perfecta', 'staying', 'as', 'close', 'possible', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'superhorse.The', 'movie', 'was', 'nominated', '1983', 'eight', 'Australian', 'Film', 'Institute', 'awards', 'winning', 'trio', 'Best', 'Achievement', 'Editing', 'Best', 'Achievement', 'Sound', 'Best', 'Original', 'Music', 'Score', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Sound', 'Editors', 'USA', 'presented', 'film', '1985', 'Golden', 'Reel', 'Award', 'Best', 'Sound', 'Editing', 'Foreign', 'Feature.Actors', 'Tom', 'Burlinson', 'Tommy', 'Woodcock', 'Martin', 'Vaughan', 'trainer', 'Harry', 'Telford', 'Ron', 'Leibman', 'sportsman', 'David', 'J.', 'Davis', 'are', 'team', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'then', 'unknown', 'racer', 'ultimately', 'are', 'rewarded', 'champion', 'ages.Phar', 'Lap', '1926-1932', 'won', '37', '51', 'races', 'captured', '1930', 'Melbourne', 'Cup', 'was', 'poised', 'take', 'best', 'North', 'America', '1932', 'tour', 'started', 'convincing', 'win', 'Agua', 'Caliente', 'Mexico', 'Handicap.The', 'swirling', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'Phar', 'Lap', 'death', 'April', '5', '1932', 'never', 'been', 'solved', 'theories', 'range', 'deliberate', 'poisoning', 'organized', 'crime', 'figures', 'accidental', 'poisoning', 'due', 'pesticide', 'grass', 'had', 'eaten', 'stomach', 'condition', 'movie', 'hints', 'solving', 'what', 'many', 'fans', 'felt', 'then', 'now', 'was', 'murder.This', 'compelling', 'story', 'Phar', 'Lap', 'test', 'time']",N/A

Phar Lap was a Big Red horse like Secretariat & showed plenty of heart as well as speed. He was adopted by ""the public"" as a favorite for just those qualities.Unfortunately in Phar Lap's case the people that surrounded him were unwatchable, unlikable & uninspiring in any manner. Phar Lap's exercise rider was a nice guy & the rest of the people talked nothing but crap to him. By the time he receives any acknowledgement at all the movie is near the end & his acknowledgement takes the form of dirty money. Great Story!The trainer is a two-faced tin Hitler interested only in himself & his ego. The owner is slightly worse than the trainer. If the show didn't have both of their wives & the children in it, the movie would be without positive human characters & they, like the exercise rider, take crap repeatedly.Still this is a story about a great race horse that made it against great odds. It is worth one look for that. The end, which is shown in the beginning, is tragic. Many movies suffer for the lack of a positive human character. This one surely did for me.I say let Phar Lap live & kill the people. Phar Lap was a 5 star horse. This is barely a 3 star movie.PS: There must be a book.

Phar Lap was a famous Australian race horse. This was another Seabiscuit-type horse who overcame big odds to achieve greatness. He just never got much press outside of Australia, I guess.Rob Leibman, as the generally unlikable guy in the film (who does have a few good moments, to be fair) is the most interesting actor in here. However, the star of the movie, outside of the horse, is Tom Burlinson, the best friend Phar Lap ever had and the only likable male in the film.The story never lagged and was beautifully shot. I am still waiting for a DVD of this and hopefully it will be made available to us in Region 1 since it now has been released in Austrailia.  It deserves having one and I was hoping it would ride the coattails of the Seabiscuit publicity tail, but apparently not.In summary, a nice story of a horse who triumphs despite a greedy trainer and owner who overwork the animal....at least according to the movie. Yeah, I realize there is a good chance much of this was exaggerated. The film industry tends to fictionalize these ""true"" stories.

330734,A1WI9BLVSUCLVZ,6302732980,John Elsegood,"[70, 70]","This great 1983 Australian movie was made 20 years before Sea Biscuit and commemorates the legendary galloper Phar Lap, foaled in NZ in 1926 but raced in Australia and Mexico (last start) until his death in the US in April 1932.In a sensational career that produced 37 wins from 51 starts, including the 1930 Melbourne Cup, 'Big Red' ( a nickname also applied to the 1973 Kentucky Derby winner Secretariat)gave Aussies something to cheer about in the Great Depression years.The film gives some idea of how this horse, captured the nation's imagination with Tom Burlinson playing the role of a young strapper called Tommy Woodcock, who was devoted to Phar Lap, and who later as a trainer in his declining years almost won the Melbourne Cup with Reckless (runner up in 1977).Phar Lap's heart was discovered to be 50% larger than a normal equine heart and judging by the Americans who have reviewed this movie I would also like to say that they have shown 'big hearts' with many praising the horse and film as better than Seabiscuit (another film I hugely enjoyed)-a great American galloper who appeared on the scene shortly after Phar Lap's demise.As for my fellow Australian reviewer who makes the accusation that Americans killed Phar Lap let me say that old furphy has been effectively demolished by Geoff Armstrong and Peter Thompson in their book 'Phar Lap.' They came to the conclusion that the great Antipodean galloper died of Duodenitis -Proximal jejunitis (also known as Anterior enteritis), a bacterial disease unknown in 1932 and which even today claims the lives of 70% of horses that are treated for it. Stress makes a horse susceptible to the disease and Phar Lap had travelled a huge distance by sea, experienced a change of seasons, raced on dirt in Mexico for the first time, got a heel injury during that sensational win and eventually died in agony in the US before racing again -but not due to anything the Americans had done.In fact the people who did try to kill Phar Lap were Australian gangsters just before the Melbourne Cup of 1930, something the film illustrates, (although the two authors mentioned above suggest the attempted shooting may have been a set-up by a local newspaper).Americans may recognise actor Burlinson as 'The Man from Snowy River'- another horsey flick -and  he is an adaptable cabaret artist too ( capable of doing a mean impression of Frank Sinatra).As for the chestnut horse 'Towering Inferno,' Phar Lap in the film, he went on to live until April 1999 before dying at the age of 26 after being struck by lightning -and the word Phar Lap is a Thai expression meaning lightning!",4,Australia's lightning 'Big Red' - and some big US hearts,1089763200,"07 14, 2004",2004,2627,"['great', '1983', 'Australian', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '20', 'years', 'Sea', 'Biscuit', 'legendary', 'galloper', 'Phar', 'Lap', 'foaled', 'NZ', '1926', 'raced', 'Australia', 'Mexico', 'last', 'start', 'death', 'US', 'April', '1932.In', 'sensational', 'career', 'produced', '37', 'wins', '51', 'starts', 'including', '1930', 'Melbourne', 'Cup', 'Red', 'nickname', 'also', 'applied', '1973', 'Kentucky', 'Derby', 'winner', 'Secretariat', 'gave', 'Aussies', 'something', 'cheer', 'Great', 'Depression', 'years.The', 'film', 'idea', 'how', 'horse', 'captured', 'nation', 'imagination', 'Tom', 'Burlinson', 'playing', 'role', 'young', 'strapper', 'called', 'Tommy', 'Woodcock', 'who', 'was', 'devoted', 'Phar', 'Lap', 'who', 'later', 'trainer', 'declining', 'years', 'almost', 'won', 'Melbourne', 'Cup', 'Reckless', 'runner', 'up', '1977', '.Phar', 'Lap', 'heart', 'was', 'discovered', 'be', '50', '%', 'larger', 'normal', 'equine', 'heart', 'judging', 'Americans', 'who', 'have', 'reviewed', 'movie', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'say', 'have', 'shown', ""'big"", 'hearts', 'many', 'praising', 'horse', 'film', 'better', 'Seabiscuit', 'film', 'hugely', 'enjoyed', '-a', 'great', 'American', 'galloper', 'who', 'appeared', 'scene', 'shortly', 'Phar', 'Lap', 'demise.As', 'fellow', 'Australian', 'reviewer', 'who', 'accusation', 'Americans', 'killed', 'Phar', 'Lap', 'let', 'say', 'old', 'furphy', 'been', 'effectively', 'demolished', 'Geoff', 'Armstrong', 'Peter', 'Thompson', 'book', 'Lap', 'came', 'conclusion', 'great', 'Antipodean', 'galloper', 'died', 'Duodenitis', '-Proximal', 'jejunitis', 'also', 'known', 'Anterior', 'enteritis', 'bacterial', 'disease', 'unknown', '1932', 'even', 'today', 'lives', '70', '%', 'horses', 'are', 'treated', 'Stress', 'horse', 'susceptible', 'disease', 'Phar', 'Lap', 'had', 'travelled', 'huge', 'distance', 'sea', 'experienced', 'change', 'seasons', 'raced', 'dirt', 'Mexico', 'first', 'time', 'got', 'heel', 'injury', 'sensational', 'win', 'eventually', 'died', 'agony', 'US', 'racing', 'again', 'not', 'due', 'anything', 'Americans', 'had', 'done.In', 'fact', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'try', 'kill', 'Phar', 'Lap', 'were', 'Australian', 'gangsters', 'just', 'Melbourne', 'Cup', '1930', 'something', 'film', 'two', 'authors', 'mentioned', 'suggest', 'attempted', 'shooting', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'set-up', 'local', 'newspaper', '.Americans', 'may', 'recognise', 'actor', 'Burlinson', ""'The"", 'Man', 'Snowy', ""River'-"", 'horsey', 'flick', '-and', 'adaptable', 'cabaret', 'artist', 'too', 'capable', 'doing', 'mean', 'impression', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', '.As', 'chestnut', 'horse', ""'Towering"", 'Inferno', 'Phar', 'Lap', 'film', 'went', 'live', 'April', '1999', 'dying', 'age', '26', 'being', 'struck', 'lightning', 'word', 'Phar', 'Lap', 'Thai', 'expression', 'meaning', 'lightning']",N/A

Phar Lap (Thai for `Lightning') earned its owners a huge amount of money before dying in 1932 in mysterious circumstances.The story has a lot in common with the more recent `Seabiscuit', but is told in less overwrought style here.  The music can be trite to say the least, and there are no surprises to be had, especially in who wins the races.. but this hardly matters for such a well made story with convincing characters.  The owners are never portrayed as two dimensional horse-loving heroes, far from it, but as genuine flawed characters we can relate to.Our window onto the story is through the eyes of the one apparent horse-lover in the movie, the stable boy (Tom Burlinson, from `The man from Snowy River') who forms a close bond with the horse.  It's this relationship that gives the movie an overall feel-good factor, even among the cut-throat and money obsessed atmosphere of horse racing.It may feel like a long shot to take a bet on a relatively unknown movie, but if you're in the mood for family friendly fare, then this movie certainly fits the bill and you'll be happy to stick with it to the finish line.",4,Sentimental but effective racehorse biography,1170115200,"01 30, 2007",2007,1396,"['Unashamedly', 'sentimental', 'directorial', 'approach', 'movie', 'nonetheless', 'legs', 'also-ran.Set', 'produced', 'Australia', '1983', 'drama', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'racehorse', 'late', '20', 'early', '30', 'became', 'household', 'name', 'Australia', 'Phar', 'Lap', 'Thai', 'Lightning', 'earned', 'owners', 'huge', 'amount', 'money', 'dying', '1932', 'mysterious', 'circumstances.The', 'story', 'lot', 'common', 'more', 'recent', 'Seabiscuit', 'told', 'less', 'overwrought', 'style', 'here', 'music', 'can', 'be', 'trite', 'say', 'least', 'are', 'surprises', 'be', 'had', 'especially', 'who', 'races..', 'hardly', 'matters', 'well', 'made', 'story', 'convincing', 'characters', 'owners', 'are', 'never', 'portrayed', 'two', 'dimensional', 'horse-loving', 'heroes', 'far', 'genuine', 'flawed', 'characters', 'can', 'relate', 'to.Our', 'window', 'story', 'eyes', 'one', 'apparent', 'horse-lover', 'movie', 'stable', 'boy', 'Tom', 'Burlinson', 'man', 'Snowy', 'River', 'who', 'close', 'bond', 'horse', 'relationship', 'movie', 'overall', 'feel-good', 'factor', 'even', 'cut-throat', 'money', 'obsessed', 'atmosphere', 'horse', 'racing.It', 'may', 'feel', 'long', 'shot', 'take', 'bet', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'movie', ""'re"", 'mood', 'family', 'friendly', 'fare', 'then', 'movie', 'certainly', 'bill', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'stick', 'finish', 'line']",N/A

When I saw Tom Burlinson's name in the cast for Phar Lap, I had to watch it. Having Ron Leibman playing the man reluctantly buying the colt made it even better. For those who have seen him in Rhinstone, he is just as arrogant in this movie. It was Davis' groom, Telford, who talked him into buying what seemed like a very unpromising racehorse, and, for quite some time, it appeared Davis was right in his opinion. The colt finished last in race after race, until his groom and exercise boy, Burlinson, found a way to awaken a will to win. From then on, Phar Lap won in every race, a feat that cost him dearly in the weight game. The officials packed more weight on him than any other racehorse in Australia's history. There came a time his owner refused to put him in a race. Officials told him if Phar Lap wasn't entered, he'd never race again. Finally, it was decided to race him at Agua Caliente at the California/Mexico border, where he wouldn't have to carry so much weight. I won't say more, but from start to finish you get a close look at the racing game, a champion colt, a devoted groom, and a down-and-out trainer who finally has a winner. A tough movie, honestly told, well acted, and well worth watching again and again. I see I typed this in August 2004, and now it is March 2009 and this movie is STILL not on a region 1 DVD. Americans and Canadians seem to be left out in the cold. Good thing I had taped it on VHS years ago so I can transfer it to a DVD when I purchase a DVD recorder, but I sure wish those responsible would stop doing this kind of thing and release movies on both region 1 and region 2 DVDs. The same for a mini-series of Jack the Ripper starring Michael Cain I taped onto a VHS and was also released only on Reigon 2 DVDs. We Phar Lap fans can hope, but I am doubtful.",5,A True Champion from Down Under,1091923200,"08 8, 2004",2004,1870,"['love', 'movies', 'horses', 'including', 'Man', 'Snowy', 'River', 'When', 'saw', 'Tom', 'Burlinson', 'name', 'cast', 'Phar', 'Lap', 'had', 'watch', 'Having', 'Ron', 'Leibman', 'playing', 'man', 'reluctantly', 'buying', 'colt', 'made', 'even', 'better', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Rhinstone', 'just', 'as', 'arrogant', 'movie', 'was', 'Davis', 'groom', 'Telford', 'who', 'talked', 'buying', 'what', 'seemed', 'very', 'unpromising', 'racehorse', 'quite', 'time', 'appeared', 'Davis', 'was', 'right', 'opinion', 'colt', 'finished', 'last', 'race', 'race', 'groom', 'exercise', 'boy', 'Burlinson', 'found', 'way', 'awaken', 'will', 'win', 'then', 'Phar', 'Lap', 'won', 'race', 'feat', 'cost', 'dearly', 'weight', 'game', 'officials', 'packed', 'more', 'weight', 'other', 'racehorse', 'Australia', 'history', 'came', 'time', 'owner', 'refused', 'put', 'race', 'Officials', 'told', 'Phar', 'Lap', 'was', ""n't"", 'entered', ""'d"", 'never', 'race', 'again', 'Finally', 'was', 'decided', 'race', 'Agua', 'Caliente', 'California/Mexico', 'border', 'where', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'carry', 'so', 'much', 'weight', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'start', 'finish', 'get', 'close', 'look', 'racing', 'game', 'champion', 'colt', 'devoted', 'groom', 'down-and-out', 'trainer', 'who', 'finally', 'winner', 'tough', 'movie', 'honestly', 'told', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'see', 'typed', 'August', '2004', 'now', 'March', '2009', 'movie', 'STILL', 'not', 'region', '1', 'DVD', 'Americans', 'Canadians', 'seem', 'be', 'left', 'out', 'cold', 'Good', 'thing', 'had', 'taped', 'VHS', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'when', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'recorder', 'sure', 'wish', 'responsible', 'would', 'stop', 'doing', 'kind', 'thing', 'release', 'movies', 'region', '1', 'region', '2', 'DVDs', 'same', 'mini-series', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Cain', 'taped', 'VHS', 'was', 'also', 'released', 'only', 'Reigon', '2', 'DVDs', 'Phar', 'Lap', 'fans', 'can', 'hope', 'am', 'doubtful']",N/A
330740,A2198O25QYUPXE,6302732980,Nicholas R.W. Henning,"[1, 1]","""Phar Lap"" is a heartfelt film which celebrates the achievements of one of Australia's greatest race horses.The movie takes some slight creative liberties but for the most part follows closely the life and times of Phar Lap, those who cared for/trained him and the inspiration he provided to Australians during the Great Depression with his tremendous victories.Tom Burlinson displays with moving authenticity the loving bond strapper Tommy Woodcock developed with Phar Lap. The entire cast is a noteworthy collection of Aussie actors/actresses and many were quite prominent during the 1970s and 1980s.This is one of an excellent batch of Australian films from the late 1970s/80s era where arguably several of Australia's top ten works were produced and this movie is deservedly part of this elite collection.Nicholas R.W.
