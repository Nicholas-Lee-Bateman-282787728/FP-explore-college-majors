Leave it to Ammy to finally have it available.  It's funny that it was considered controversial by today's standards.  What is here is a charming and often heartbreaking story of a young couple, Jenny (Hayley Mills) and Arthur (Hywel Bennett) who have just gotten married but, after a travel agent rips them and several other people off, they are forced to stay with his parents and brother a lot longer than they'd planned.  Due to a lack of privacy, a lot of uncomfortable situations arise for them, particularly the inability to consummate their marriage.""She doesn't sing anymore,"" Arthur's father observes (played immaculately by Hayley's father John) to his wife (Marjorie Rhodes).  You wouldn't either in that environment.  The walls of the house are paper thin and, try as they might, they just can't find their own place to live.  While Arthur is sexually frustrated and Jenny is being pursued a bit too friendly-like by his brother Geoffrey (Murray Head, who later went on to record the big dance hit ""One Night in Bangkok), the neighbors are beginning to talk.  This is supposed to be funny and, in a way it is, because I've never known people to be able to mind their own business for the most part.Then we have both the couple's parents, Arthur's in particular.  Marjorie Rhodes is superb is the kindly, yet imbittered wife of a man who obviously longed to be with his friend Billy more than her.  While it's obvious she loves him, it is just as obvious to anyone (as Jenny's mother recognized) there was somethiing wrong there.  I don't want to give the ending away, so all I can say is that when things come to a head, I have to congratulate Arthur's boss's wife for giving him what for, the funniest part of the entire film, because he deserved it!Handled sensitively and humorously, this movie is a British gem that doesn't belittle the characters, and you feel you can truly relate to them like they live next door to you.  Also, boasting a great musical score by Sir Paul McCartney and George Martin, the movie contains the right atmosphere to enhance the storyline and the actors' wonderful performances.  Full of mischief, heartache, and characters that are never dull or one-dimensional, this is a great movie for anyone who is interested in why people do the things they do in certain situations.

This lesser known film from Naughton, directed and produced by the Boulting brothers, also doesn't shy away from what was then controversial material.  Everything looks  perfect for the newlyweds in their picaresque Nothern England berg.  Underneath it all lies father-son tensions, impotence, and possible latent homosexuality.  Never fear, though.  At it's heart ""The Family Way"" is a light-hearted affair and in the end everything wraps up nicely and satisfactorily in a neat little bow.  The cast is uniformly excellent.  Hayley Mills graduates with honors from children's films to adult roles.  Not to be overlooked is a deliciously gratuitous bum shot of Hayley.

Hywel Bennett and Hayley Mills make a gorgeous couple and they had a chemistry that worked so well in this film that they went on to star in two other very different films.

I have viewed this as letterboxed on a 4x3 screen and as a full 16x9 presentation on a 40"" lcd. Sounds like the reviewer has his dvd player or flat screen on the wrong setting.Actually, either way it doesn't matter. Given the rarity of this title: the fact that it is rarely on tv and has never been released here in the U.S. all these years on vhs despite it's pedigree, I'd accept any legit version at this point.A smart, funny, unforgettable drama that entertains while it quietly builds to a powerful emotional ending that resonates long after the film is over. And it has the kind of ensemble acting that you just don't see in films all that much anymore. Every character is memorable and all the performances are dead-on perfect with special kudos to John Mills and Marjorie Rhodes who will make you laugh as they quietly break your heart.Sure the sexual mores of the planet have changed, but people haven't. And the film is ultimately about families and their relationships to one another, and in that regard the film is timeless.This edition has a soundtrack that has ""enhanced audio"" which according to my ears means the dialogue is up front, cleaner and clearer than any other version I've seen. The sometimes heavy British accents are now totally understandable. What it also does is put Paul McCartney's surprisingly appropriate and unforgettable score a little too much in the backround.

With a nosey family and paper-thin walls, the couple has no privacy and cannot consummate their marriage.  As time goes by, they discover, to their horror, that the whole town is gossiping about their delicate problem.This comedy/drama is gentle and sweet and has sympathetic performances by all.  Mills leaves behind the perky child she played in her early films; here she's a sensible and mature bride and even shows off her bum. Bennet is memorable as the intense and miserable husband; but the real stars of the film are John Mills and Marjorie Rhodes who play Arthur's working-class parents.  They give remarkably compelling performances and bring real depth to the story, adding a painful subplot from their own newlywed days.  Their stoic characters aren't accustomed to talking about emotions, but their devotion to one another is never in doubt.

Risoli ""black farmer""","[11, 11]","The Boulting Brothers' ""The Family Way"" released in 1967 by Warner Bros. here in the U.S.A. was Hayley Mills' first film for the team, (she married one of the brothers).  It was the first of three films she made with her co-star, Hywel Bennett and also starred John Mills, Marjorie Rhodes, Avril Angers, Murray Head (the entire expertly picked cast) all in excellent, subtly stated performances.  The music was later applauded as the start of Paul McCartney's classical career.  The second film teaming the two stars and made for the Boulting Brothers, ""Twisted Nerve"" received a botched publicity campaign which nearly killed the film's being seen for many years.  (The third film teaming the two co-stars was the film version of Agatha Christie's ""Endless Night"" in 1972 for Sidney Gilliat).  Although in the Hitchcock vein (with a score by Bernard Herrmann), ""Twisted Nerve"" was also extremely original and imaginative and deserves to be released in all regions on DVD.  Both films strike notes as superlative entertainment in a day when imagination is needed in the film business, their being sixties' product actually a plus.  ""The Family Way"" can not be faulted as one feels as if one is a family member every moment and believes in the characters and doesn't want to see the film end. If the critical complaint of it being overlong is to be considered seriously (it had originally been a play by Bill Naughton, titled ""All in Good Time""), most viewings see the film stand as a classic and a trend-setter both in one and the stuff it so cherishes, life, finds fulfillment in the enactment.
