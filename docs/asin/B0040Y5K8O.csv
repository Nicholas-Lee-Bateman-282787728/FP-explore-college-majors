1379682,A3GGT3AQMGDTH2,B0040Y5K8O,"A. S. W. ""Adam Soch""","[0, 2]","MAKE WAR NOT LOVE or was it the other way around?  Not in this well written and acted film BROTHERHOOD, where two natural events are not tolerated just because THEY told them so, globalization and honest feelings.  The beautiful saying  ""live and let live"" has no meaning for so many in this ever growing and shifting global society or the sadistic skinheads and members of this Danish brotherhood.Gone are the days when countries were separated by well-guarded borders or when you were supposed to be whatever your religion, family or community wanted you to be.  It is a lost cause, but THEY still fight it with venom like hate and gruesome violence.At first you are led to believe that the title of the film is referring to the group where a premium membership is difficult to get, but latter you discover the true meaning of brotherhood or betrayed brotherhood.  There were moments during the film when I forgot to respire, I forgot where I am or what time it was, finding myself wanting to turn away from the screen for a second hoping to protect myself from the violent blows or the delightfully true moments of beauty and love of the two protagonist.  Repressing your feeling is possible only for a short period of time and we all do this on a regular basis, but when it come down to our biological necessity, what we call LOVE, sooner or latter it will erupt, explode, gush out and NOT gently but with dire consequences.Brotherhood is an important film on so many levels for individuals and society in general, especially for those living with ""stuck in ancient times"" mentality.  Humankind evolves with lightning speed and ""some"" people should evolve with it, but unfortunately dogma and personal feelings and opinions are huge obstacles, creating violence and unnecessary hurt.  For me this great film has an important message: Let people love and be true to themselves because it has nothing to do with you or the ills of the world and if you oppose this natural feeling, YOU are an obstacle to humanity and the beautiful progression nature created for us to ""live life"" as it should be lived.",5,Make War!

But if you're at all squeamish, be prepared to squirm. The film is fraught with the forbidden: homosexual desire, same-sex violence, racism, fascist ideology, etc. It does not flinch, but you will.Brutal-tender in the way the Danes excel at, Brotherhood takes no prisoners as it marches us into the marshes of social deviance. It's bitter, blunt and unredeeming, though not without an austere kind of beauty. Love among the degenerate. The smallest of miracles, but miraculous nonetheless..As a piece of film-making it feels like a somewhat sedate version of the Dogma 95 movement and aesthetic. But the hand-held approach never feels like you're on a carousel. Just enough unsteadiness to augment the all pervasive sense of unnervedness. That approach has become standard in the industry, but it feels organic here; the interplay of camera movement with the actors' gestures and reactions precisely calibrated in an understated, quasi throw-away fashion. It works.The muted color palette and general darkness add to the mood of forsakenness.The dvd looks creamy rather than razor-sharp. I suspect that is due to cinematographic choices rather than an inadequate transfer.Bottom line: this is not a gay movie, but one about the vicissitudes of homosocial bonding through shared hatred and alienation and the fate of tenderness in a subculture of the vicious.

""Brotherhood"" tells the story of Lars, a Danish officer, who is up for promotion to Sergeant.  However, because one of his ""men"" complained that he made a pass at him, Lars is denied the promotion.  He leaves the Army and returns home not really knowing what direction he wants to go.He then encounters the local White Supremacist group and--apprehensively--decides to give that a try (I think out of sheer boredom).  Fatty, the leader of the group, becomes quite smitten with Lars because he sees him as very educated and a great leader--qualities that the majority of his group lack.  Lars is then teamed with Jimmie for indoctrination into the group...and a funny thing happens:  both men find they are very attracted to each other.  That is all I will give away about the plot.I find other comnparisons of the characters in ""Brotherhood"" to the characters in ""Brokeback Mountain"" to be spot-on.  Two men, in love, but because of their surroundings and their society, they can never express their love unless it's behind closed doors.  The ending of the movie was gut-wrenching.  The love scenes in this movie were handled with the professionalism required; this is not an attempt to peddle soft-corn porn.  This is a love story.  And a love story that touched me very deeply.

There is violence in the movie and it's not like Bruce Willis, lots of guns, and you know nobody gets hurt. This seems more real.The acting, the directing was good. The movie visually was dark... I don't know if that's just the landscape of the filming, but it wasn't beautiful. It was gloomy. I probably would have given this 4 stars if it wasn't enveloped in Nazi stuff. While there's a love story, it's not Pretty Woman / Julia Roberts love. It's more primal and hidden. I suppose, as another review posted, it is a little like Brokeback, 1 dude is more willing to dive in, while the other is torn and wants to stay hidden. But Brokeback was set in beautiful landscape where they were herders, this tale is, oh, they are Neo-Nazis. So one is surrounded by beauty, and this movie is not.I can't recommend it because I'd rather see an uplifting movie. If you want drama and don't mind evil getting punished then see this.

1379688,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B0040Y5K8O,J. Martin,"[1, 2]","As soon as a movie starts, I start thinking about how I'm going to review it. For the first 40 minutes, I thought I was going to throw this movie in the gutter where it belonged when I reviewed it, because for all that time there's practically nothing but revolting Nazi crap. It's very, very hard to sit through. The first scene is the violent beating of a cruising gay man by a skinhead who had come on to him and told him how beautiful he was before calling out his gang to beat and kick the guy to a pulp (an incident that re-enters the story significantly near the end).After that are long scenes of the ugly Nazis (the men are physically as well as morally ugly) spewing their toxic garbage into my ears where it was not welcome. But then... ah, then... at about the 41-minute mark, Lars and Jimmy start looking at each other in a new way, and EVERYTHING changes. The first 40 minutes of hateful garbage are well worth suffering through to get to that exquisite tenderness and passion.Thure Lindhardt as Lars is a gentle, enormously attractive beauty from his first scene to his last, but the character is pretty flat: steady and strong but not very interesting. David Dencik got the meaty role in Jimmy, and he pulls it off brilliantly. He is completely believable both as the bitter, arrogant, brutal Nazi homophobe and as the sweet, gentle, deeply vulnerable and passionate man who eventually emerges from that hateful shell. If the first third of the movie had not been so revolting, Jimmy's emergence from that horrible world would not have been so marvelous. And it IS marvelous, some of the loveliest acting I have ever seen.Raw, naked, totally defenseless vulnerability is something rarely seen in movies, particularly from male actors. In fact the ONLY previous example that comes to mind is Jane Fonda fairly early in her career - inKluteand even more powerfully earlier inThey Shoot Horses, Don't They?Fonda, in both those roles, had been beaten down by a cruel system she was helpless against; but Dencik is breaking out - against his own will - from within an even more brutal system in which he has been on top and on which he has been completely dependent for his identity.He discovers that he's just like the guys he's been attacking, and that discovery shatters him. It shatters him, but it finally begins to set him free to be himself for the first time. It's a very great performance that makes an otherwise mediocre movie (deeply offensive when it's not simply unbelievable) well worth watching. The transformation just in his eyes is astonishing.

First, Lars is given no motivation whatsoever for joining the Neo-Nazi movement. Sure, he's unfairly denied a promotion, but his response (this is a former officer, mind you) is to abandon his career, walk out on his family (and a great job offer his mother secured for him), and join a group of fascists?  I need more than ""Hmmm, I guess he's a little angry and doesn't know how to positively channel his energy"" to accept his decision to join the brotherhood. Since Lars's character is undeveloped, viewers are asked to go along with his very radical and unsavory decision. Second, no matter how sweet their blossoming love for each other is (and at times it IS sort of sweet), I find it difficult to sympathize with two repellent characters. No matter how different and conflicted their lives, they're not Romeo and Juliet--no matter how plaintively the strings play in the background--and although I might be touched, I'm ultimately not moved. It's kind of like a director asking an audience to warm up to a lonely child who finds a lost puppy and takes it home after spending years torturing and skinning cats. Sorry, I'm not buying it.

While being indoctrinated, he is attracted to the man in charge of his training, who in turn is drawn to him.

Definitely not for the faint of heart.Follow this one with a light-hearted comedy as a chaser, to get the bitter taste out of your mouth.",4,"Bitter, brutal and bleak",1321228800,"11 14, 2011",2011,778,"['Bleak', 'Danish', 'drama', 'disaffected', 'young', 'gay', 'ex-army', 'officer', 'who', 'neo-Nazi', 'group', 'being', 'indoctrinated', 'attracted', 'man', 'charge', 'training', 'who', 'turn', 'drawn', 'two', 'become', 'lovers', 'situation', 'more', 'little', 'frowned', 'racist', 'homophobic', 'party.Thure', 'Lindhardt', 'ex-army', 'officer', 'David', 'Dencik', 'trainer', 'are', 'excellent', 'Nicolas', 'Bro', 'chilling', 'performance', 'seemingly', 'innocuous', 'affable', 'leader', 'group', 'benign', 'mask', 'heartless', 'monster.Brutal', 'disturbing', 'unrelentingly', 'dark', 'Brotherhood', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'Definitely', 'not', 'faint', 'heart.Follow', 'one', 'light-hearted', 'comedy', 'chaser', 'get', 'bitter', 'taste', 'mouth']",N/A
1379693,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B0040Y5K8O,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[1, 1]","Brother hood or `Broderskab' is an award winning Danish film from Director and co-writer Nicolo Donato, this is his first feature, but he has done pop videos for the likes of `The Ravonettes'. This then is a much improved step in the right direction.It tells the story of Lars (Thure Lindhardt), who leaves the army after making proposals to some of his men whilst on out for drinks. He goes home but sort of drifts into a neo-Nazi gang. He is at first disgusted, but is persuaded to come to a beach party, and slowly starts to work with the violent thugs. This includes homophobic acts including unprovoked attacks on people and property. They are also anti Muslim and believe they are upholding the `laws of nature'.  After his Mum tries to get him re enlisted to the army, he leaves and ends up with the group leader.He puts him up with another ex soldier who is sprucing up the organisations beach house. This then is Jimmy (David Dencik), he is at first cold towards Lars, but a friendship slowly blossoms, and then drink gets involved and well you can guess quite literally what comes next.There are lots of brilliant moments in this film, including a right wing gig, which looks very homo erotic and sort of explains why some gay men are drawn into such activities. There is an excellent book by Max Schaefer which deals with the issues of being a `gay Nazi' - `Children of the Sun'.This is a really good film that tries to deal with the paradox of being gay yet openly getting involved in `queer bashing'. Lars does do a great speech about Ernst Rohm at one point, and I love that fact that one of the Neo-Nazis is called `Kenneth'. A word of warning, this is gay themed,  not a gay semi porno, so do not expect lots of bedroom action, this is a drama.This is obviously in Danish with good sub titles and runs to 90 minutes, for a first effort Nicolo Donato has done a superb job, and I am looking forward to his next offering.",4,"It's Gay, It's Danish and It's got Nazis!",1312416000,"08 4, 2011",2011,1935,"['Brother', 'hood', 'Broderskab', 'award', 'winning', 'Danish', 'film', 'Director', 'co-writer', 'Nicolo', 'Donato', 'first', 'feature', 'done', 'pop', 'videos', 'likes', 'Ravonettes', 'then', 'much', 'improved', 'step', 'right', 'direction.It', 'story', 'Lars', 'Thure', 'Lindhardt', 'who', 'army', 'making', 'proposals', 'men', 'whilst', 'out', 'drinks', 'home', 'sort', 'drifts', 'neo-Nazi', 'gang', 'first', 'disgusted', 'persuaded', 'come', 'beach', 'party', 'slowly', 'starts', 'work', 'violent', 'thugs', 'homophobic', 'acts', 'including', 'unprovoked', 'attacks', 'people', 'property', 'are', 'also', 'anti', 'Muslim', 'believe', 'are', 'upholding', 'laws', 'nature', 'Mum', 'tries', 'get', 're', 'enlisted', 'army', 'up', 'group', 'leader.He', 'up', 'ex', 'soldier', 'who', 'sprucing', 'up', 'organisations', 'beach', 'house', 'then', 'Jimmy', 'David', 'Dencik', 'first', 'cold', 'towards', 'Lars', 'friendship', 'slowly', 'blossoms', 'then', 'drink', 'involved', 'well', 'can', 'guess', 'quite', 'literally', 'what', 'next.There', 'are', 'lots', 'brilliant', 'moments', 'film', 'including', 'right', 'wing', 'gig', 'very', 'homo', 'erotic', 'sort', 'explains', 'why', 'gay', 'men', 'are', 'drawn', 'such', 'activities', 'excellent', 'book', 'Max', 'Schaefer', 'issues', 'being', 'gay', 'Nazi', 'Children', ""Sun'.This"", 'really', 'good', 'film', 'deal', 'paradox', 'being', 'gay', 'yet', 'openly', 'getting', 'involved', 'queer', 'bashing', 'Lars', 'do', 'great', 'speech', 'Ernst', 'Rohm', 'one', 'point', 'love', 'fact', 'one', 'Neo-Nazis', 'called', 'Kenneth', 'word', 'warning', 'gay', 'themed', 'not', 'gay', 'semi', 'porno', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'lots', 'bedroom', 'action', 'drama.This', 'obviously', 'Danish', 'good', 'sub', 'titles', '90', 'minutes', 'first', 'effort', 'Nicolo', 'Donato', 'done', 'superb', 'job', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'offering']",N/A
