He has a mustache and bell bottom pants, but it sure looks like him, even has the same mannerisms I've seen in interviews and movies.  This totally distracted me from Richard, so I had to start over, but how fun if it is him.  He would have been about 25 at the time.  Anyway, if you are offended by this DVD it's your own fault.

448795,A2HWPTLXOLI2BQ,6305111677,Daniel Fineberg,"[13, 14]","The writer Stanley Crouch chose a fine time to write his article in the New York Daily News about Richard's ""flawed legacy"", how he perpetuated the stereotypes and attitudes that are at least in part responsible for the current state of our culture. We knew Crouch to be a mediocre writer but now we have enough evidence to understand that he is intellectually retarded as well (in addition to having an absurdly volatile temper). In his attempt to set up Pryor and Cosby as binary opposites, he reveals nothing about either performer and everything about his colossal misunderstanding and if he ever sobers up into reality he will be ashamed of himself. At its highest point, art is not here to enshrine anyone's values, it is here to expand consciousness. ""Pryor reached for anything that would make white America uncomfortable."" These can only be the musings of a man who has not done his homework on his subject or who has only processed the information necessary for him to push his feeble viewpoint.This DVD is the best video document we have of Pryor in concert, taped in Long Beach, featuring his timeless impressions of women, children, animals, winos, his musings on Ali, Leon Spinks, rednecks-- his tremendous physical and emotional expression, his frailty and his humanity.

Therefore, I can't comment on the dvd remastering (which many reviewers detested). Just understand that the one star reviews are not for the movie itself.This is Richard Pryor's best stand up comedy film. He is the farthest thing from politically correct.  However, though not as politically oriented as Lenny Bruce, Pryor does not make the mistake of much modern ""out there"" humor and bask in offensive stereotypes. He uses stereotypes (e.g. how white people react to black people, the ""macho"" stud who has little regard for women)and shreds them to pieces.  Then there are parts such as where he imitates what dobermans would say if they could talk that are really bizzare but they work. As compared to his next stand up comedy film ""Live on the Sunset Strip"", this is better. Richard Pryor's audience didn't automatically love everything he joked about yet and the part of the film where he confronts a heckler is hilarious.  Chances are you know someone like the cast of characters he creates.

Denis Leary, Bill Hicks, and Dave Chappelle come to mind when I think of such a select group, but Richard Pryor may well have towered over them all.  And 1979's Richard Pryor: Live in Concert may have been his definitive document.  This 90-minute standup DVD sees Pryor giving a manic, imaginative, deliriously profane performance that had the audience in the palm of his hand from beginning to end.  A master impersonator with a vast pantheon of characters and voices, Pryor didn't just talk about his subjects, he *became* them; he acted out every person, every story, and every idea to the fullest extent possible, constantly blurring the line between real and make-believe.  Jokes about animals quickly gave way to spot-on imitations, whether of the inner thoughts of Dobermans or of his pet monkey's illicit sexual activities.  Pryor's musings about racial differences in expressing grief were funny and insightful, but they were merely a setup for an outrageous recounting of his grandmother's reaction to his cocaine habit.  There are also plenty of brutally honest stories about Pryor's life with his father, ranging from his father's death in mid-coitus (""he came and went at the same time""), to the one time Pryor stood up to his old man (""It wasn't really a fight, but I did the best I could""), and their time hunting together (""I hated being the dog"").  Pryor's honesty and insightfulness come out in plenty of other places too, from his troubles with the law to his heart attack to his less-than-stellar boxing career.  All throughout, though, no matter what the subject, Pryor piles on joke after insight after impression with pitch-perfect timing and plenty of scatological language.  For those of any age, race, or political leaning, this is a must-see.",5,A master at the height of his powers,1119657600,"06 25, 2005",2005,2037,"['past', 'few', 'decades', 'have', 'seen', 'emergence', 'tons', 'comedians', 'who', 'spit', 'out', 'swears', 'graphic', 'subject', 'matter', 'reckless', 'abandon', 'precious', 'few', 'have', 'taken', 'offensive', 'subject', 'matter', 'turned', 'something', 'intelligent', 'entertaining', 'same', 'time', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'Bill', 'Hicks', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'come', 'mind', 'when', 'think', 'select', 'group', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'towered', '1979', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'Live', 'Concert', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'definitive', 'document', '90-minute', 'standup', 'DVD', 'Pryor', 'giving', 'manic', 'imaginative', 'deliriously', 'profane', 'performance', 'had', 'audience', 'palm', 'hand', 'beginning', 'end', 'master', 'impersonator', 'vast', 'pantheon', 'characters', 'voices', 'Pryor', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'talk', 'subjects', 'acted', 'out', 'person', 'story', 'idea', 'fullest', 'extent', 'possible', 'constantly', 'blurring', 'line', 'real', 'make-believe', 'Jokes', 'animals', 'quickly', 'gave', 'way', 'spot-on', 'imitations', 'inner', 'thoughts', 'Dobermans', 'pet', 'monkey', 'illicit', 'sexual', 'activities', 'Pryor', 'musings', 'racial', 'differences', 'expressing', 'grief', 'were', 'funny', 'insightful', 'were', 'merely', 'setup', 'outrageous', 'recounting', 'grandmother', 'reaction', 'cocaine', 'habit', 'are', 'also', 'plenty', 'brutally', 'honest', 'stories', 'Pryor', 'life', 'father', 'ranging', 'father', 'death', 'mid-coitus', 'came', 'went', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'time', 'Pryor', 'stood', 'up', 'old', 'man', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'fight', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'time', 'hunting', 'together', 'hated', 'being', 'dog', 'Pryor', 'honesty', 'insightfulness', 'come', 'out', 'plenty', 'other', 'places', 'too', 'troubles', 'law', 'heart', 'attack', 'less-than-stellar', 'boxing', 'career', 'matter', 'what', 'subject', 'Pryor', 'joke', 'insight', 'impression', 'pitch-perfect', 'timing', 'plenty', 'scatological', 'language', 'age', 'race', 'political', 'leaning', 'must-see']",Richard Pryor - Live in Concert
