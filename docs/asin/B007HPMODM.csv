""Cole""","[2, 2]","I am a huge Amazing Race fan, along with my family, so you can imagine my joy when I discovered that earlier seasons had been released on Amazon.  I bought 2-6 in one big shopping cart and haven't looked back.  Season Five is absolutely stunning when taking into account a couple of different factors:1) the all-star cast (Colin and Christie/Mirna and Charla to name two)2) the variability in tasks and locations3) the ensuing drama4) the nail-biting final episodesThe entire season was fraught with drama and interesting tactics used by teams.  One tactic I was generally surprised with was when a final three team decided to call ahead for a fast taxi at the airport and shipped home miscellaneous items so that it wouldn't hinder their performance.Season Five features the love-'em-or-hate-'em team Colin and Christie.  Always in ultra-competitive mode and known for their frequent outbursts of anger, the duo soared through the competition and never looked back. Some of the other reviews have mentioned classic moments featuring Colin, such as his moment with the ox, ""I'm packin' it!"", and a clash a with an unruly cab driver.  Probably my favorite moment was when a team drove by another and shouted an obscenity from the window.All in all, this season was very memorable and highlights the show's humble beginnings as it's fun to see the vast differences in gameplay from then to now.  One qualm I have about the finale was the lack of a difficult task to complete in order to get to the finish line -- it wasn't terrible but it was lackluster to say the least.I for one support more releases of this fantastic show on DVD and hope that Amazon sees the light of seasons 8-12.",5,Absolutely hysterical and a classic season that deserves your attention,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,1683,"['am', 'huge', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'fan', 'family', 'can', 'imagine', 'joy', 'when', 'discovered', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'Amazon', 'bought', '2-6', 'one', 'big', 'shopping', 'cart', 'have', ""n't"", 'looked', 'back', 'Season', 'Five', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'when', 'taking', 'account', 'couple', 'different', 'factors:1', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Colin', 'Christie/Mirna', 'Charla', 'name', 'two', '2', 'variability', 'tasks', 'locations3', 'ensuing', 'drama4', 'nail-biting', 'final', 'episodesThe', 'entire', 'season', 'was', 'fraught', 'drama', 'interesting', 'tactics', 'used', 'teams', 'One', 'tactic', 'was', 'generally', 'surprised', 'was', 'when', 'final', 'three', 'team', 'decided', 'call', 'ahead', 'fast', 'taxi', 'airport', 'shipped', 'home', 'miscellaneous', 'items', 'would', ""n't"", 'hinder', 'performance.Season', 'Five', ""love-'em-or-hate-'em"", 'team', 'Colin', 'Christie', 'Always', 'ultra-competitive', 'mode', 'known', 'frequent', 'outbursts', 'anger', 'duo', 'soared', 'competition', 'never', 'looked', 'back', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'mentioned', 'classic', 'moments', 'featuring', 'Colin', 'such', 'moment', 'ox', ""'m"", 'packin', 'clash', 'unruly', 'cab', 'driver', 'Probably', 'favorite', 'moment', 'was', 'when', 'team', 'drove', 'shouted', 'obscenity', 'window.All', 'season', 'was', 'very', 'memorable', 'show', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'fun', 'see', 'vast', 'differences', 'gameplay', 'then', 'now', 'One', 'qualm', 'have', 'finale', 'was', 'lack', 'difficult', 'task', 'complete', 'order', 'get', 'finish', 'line', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'was', 'lackluster', 'say', 'least.I', 'one', 'support', 'more', 'releases', 'fantastic', 'show', 'DVD', 'hope', 'Amazon', 'light', 'seasons', '8-12']",The Amazing Race: Season 5

I've been purchasing each season, and plan to get them all; but they always arrive a bit scuffed; I only had 1 season scuffed so badly it didn't play correctly, and Amazon was great on the refund; but there's nothing worse than getting halfway through a season, only to find a spot where it freezes-up due to scuffing. I don't know if it's a human- handling or a machine-burning problem, but it should be easily rectified with a bit better quality control.",5,Just Another Awesome Race!,1350086400,"10 13, 2012",2012,606,"['Season', '5', 'was', 'great', 'Season', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'Only', 'one', 'complaint', '.whomever', 'making', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'terrible', 'quality', 'control', ""'ve"", 'been', 'purchasing', 'season', 'plan', 'get', 'always', 'arrive', 'bit', 'scuffed', 'only', 'had', '1', 'season', 'scuffed', 'so', 'badly', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'correctly', 'Amazon', 'was', 'great', 'refund', 'nothing', 'worse', 'getting', 'halfway', 'season', 'only', 'find', 'spot', 'where', 'freezes-up', 'due', 'scuffing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'human-', 'handling', 'machine-burning', 'problem', 'should', 'be', 'easily', 'rectified', 'bit', 'better', 'quality', 'control']",The Amazing Race: Season 5

While there are an assortment of forgettable racers, Colin and Christie remain the stars of the show whether you love them or hate them.  Christie with her uber-manic intensity (with which she encourages a jeepney driver to run people down) and Colin with his cries of, ""My ox is broken!"" and ""I'm packin' it!"".  I'm delighted that this season will soon be available on DVD because it's the main reason we are now enjoying season 20.

1530932,A5YY84IO6W2Q5,B007HPMODM,Sheryl McCallister,"[13, 14]","I know that many of you hate them, but I'll argue all day long that Colin and Christie saved the Amazing Race in Season 5.It literally took 10 races before a couples team (Megan and Shane) tied their combined record of 9 combined 1st/2nd placements; and Megan and Shane did it with pre-arranged flights and a whole lot of bunching to put them up one win (7/2).  The fact that Mirna so clearly hated Colin (he's a criminal!) endeared him to at least half the audience, and the fact that both C&C; were intent at every moment on beating every other team, made this race feel like an actual competition.The animosity that built up between Colin and the other competitors after he and Christie came from the middle of the pack to going 1st or second in the next 8 legs?  That saved the race. Because people either loved Colin because he got that this was a RACE!!!! (which I admit, I did; Colin is my favorite racer ever) or they hated him because he didn't much care what he did to other teams, as long as it put him ahead of them.  And they got their friends to watch, by the dozen that summer; and they saved The Amazing Race.And then...came the Ox.Many people have melted down. Many people have had killer fatigue overwhelm them. Many people have said memorable things.Nobody but Colin has claimed his animal was broken.I love him, and I love this race.
