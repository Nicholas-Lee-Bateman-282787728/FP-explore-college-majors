When the mysterious man enters his life, the story gets complicated - and is told effectively with lots of events and people many of us can relate to our lives - the long lost childhood sweethart, the boy's gradual discovery of himself - he's really good spirited and respectful - and the truth of his search reveals itself through the eyes of the woman - the ""unclaimed"" romance from the man's earlier years.

Young Nathan is out in the world selling his body to survive and getting beat in the process. He runs away after his mom dies from an overdose and meets Boone who is on a mission but we are left to try and figure out what or who Boone really is. It is an interesting movie that doesn't leave us wanting and my favorite scene is when Boone rescues Nathan from the perverts bathroom at the end of the movie and Nathans words to Boone will leave you in tears.

1185706,A30KGYUOZRUCRJ,B001EHDMW6,Hulka,"[98, 103]","This was an awesome movie! A positive uplifting story about a abandoned adolescent boy looking for a father who meets a man trying to forget the pain of his relationship with his own father. Nathan is a sexually confused boy desperately looking for security of a father figure. He runs into Boone, a hardened loner whom Nathan latches onto. We learn that Boone has some emotional father issues of his own, and Nathan shows up to provide him a way to work them out. In other words, Boone finds that he can resolve his own sadness at his father's lack of love by giving Nathan the love and security he needs. This is a low budget made-for-tv movie, but the unusual story line---and the heart rendering performance by Branden Nadon as Nathan---make this a must-see movie for anyone who has familiar with the sort of emotional wounds that too often occur between father and son. It brought tears to my eyes...and a good feeling at the happy ending. I agree--must see.BTW, this is NOT a movie about boylove or child prostitution, this is really about the painful relationships between fathers and sons. The need for men to mentor their sons, and the need of an adolecent boy for a strong male role model. Nathan's involvement in sexual abuse is only important in the development of his character as a lost boy. It adds to the drama that Boone's interest in him was entirely non-sexual. Unfortunately, inclusion of these issues might have doomed this astounding movie to oblivion. That is really sad.Struck by Brandon Nadon's performance, I immediately looked for more pictures by thim only to learn that Branden Nadon subsequent career was making some sleazy horror movies. So I guess he got typecast a little. Sad, he was a tremendous actor that deserved some better roles. See more of Nadon in a bit part in Living with the Dead, Taken and Masters of Horror.

1185707,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B001EHDMW6,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 2]","The gay theme is only secondary in this film. A rather young boy, probably ten or eleven, the son of a drug addicted mother who dies one day on him with an overdose she gets from the heroin he has brought her and he had bought with the money he had made with an older man he had serviced intimately.He escapes social services and manages to find himself in the hands, some sort of two way blackmailing or dependence, of a man he decides is going to be his father. He manages to get in his car and the man starts taking him to Vancouver.On the way to there the man goes back to his hometown where he visits his invalid and unconscious father but that leads him to a girl friend from a long time ago and the boy he is transporting, Nathan, falls for the son of the woman. The man, Boon, falls again or anew for the woman, but he is on a big case, though we do not know exactly what, criminal probably.Nathan comes to a desperate proposal to keep Boon, a desperate intimate proposal that Boon refuses and that refusal sets Nathan on the run again.The action ends up in Vancouver for sure where Nathan is more or less in the room of an older man and needs to be reprieved from perdition while Boon is following and arriving and breaking a door, and at the same time he is getting tailed by an important criminal of some kind he is dealing with.The end is sentimental in a way but everything gets clear though most of the important scenes happen in the night with little light and kind of all blurred up in and by darkness.The question of the film is simple. Does a boy need a father? What kind of substitute activities can a boy without a father do to feel close to an older man? The answer is as simple as the question. Yes a boy needs a father or a father substitute and a boy without such a father model next to him will do all kinds of risky and dumb things to feel older than he is and to fill the emptiness he experiences in his heart somewhere between his brain and his diaphragm.Maybe it could be better not to show that film to children under the tender age of ten or something like that. And be ready to answer a few questions if your son is too young and direct enough to ask embarrassing queries.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,To survive a boy and find a father figure...,1341446400,"07 5, 2012",2012,2225,"['gay', 'theme', 'only', 'secondary', 'film', 'rather', 'young', 'boy', 'probably', 'ten', 'eleven', 'son', 'drug', 'addicted', 'mother', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'overdose', 'heroin', 'brought', 'had', 'bought', 'money', 'had', 'made', 'older', 'man', 'had', 'serviced', 'intimately.He', 'escapes', 'social', 'services', 'manages', 'find', 'hands', 'sort', 'two', 'way', 'blackmailing', 'dependence', 'man', 'going', 'be', 'father', 'get', 'car', 'man', 'taking', 'Vancouver.On', 'way', 'there', 'man', 'back', 'hometown', 'where', 'invalid', 'unconscious', 'father', 'girl', 'friend', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'boy', 'transporting', 'Nathan', 'son', 'woman', 'man', 'Boon', 'again', 'anew', 'woman', 'big', 'case', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'criminal', 'probably.Nathan', 'desperate', 'proposal', 'keep', 'Boon', 'desperate', 'intimate', 'proposal', 'Boon', 'refuses', 'refusal', 'Nathan', 'run', 'action', 'up', 'Vancouver', 'sure', 'where', 'Nathan', 'more', 'less', 'room', 'older', 'man', 'be', 'reprieved', 'perdition', 'Boon', 'following', 'arriving', 'breaking', 'door', 'same', 'time', 'getting', 'tailed', 'important', 'criminal', 'kind', 'dealing', 'with.The', 'end', 'sentimental', 'way', 'everything', 'clear', 'most', 'important', 'scenes', 'happen', 'night', 'little', 'light', 'kind', 'blurred', 'up', 'darkness.The', 'question', 'film', 'simple', 'boy', 'need', 'father', 'What', 'kind', 'substitute', 'activities', 'can', 'boy', 'father', 'do', 'feel', 'close', 'older', 'man', 'answer', 'as', 'simple', 'question', 'Yes', 'boy', 'father', 'father', 'substitute', 'boy', 'father', 'model', 'next', 'will', 'do', 'kinds', 'risky', 'dumb', 'things', 'feel', 'older', 'fill', 'emptiness', 'heart', 'somewhere', 'brain', 'diaphragm.Maybe', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'not', 'show', 'film', 'children', 'tender', 'age', 'ten', 'something', 'be', 'ready', 'answer', 'few', 'questions', 'son', 'too', 'young', 'direct', 'enough', 'ask', 'embarrassing', 'queries.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Jet Boy

1185719,A221XWNYJZX863,B001EHDMW6,"Paul A. Klinger ""weather nut""","[0, 0]","I have reviewed this film on IMDB, but it is so good, I want to add a review here.  As others have stated, Branden Nadon gives a spectacular performanceas a 14 year old (and he looks 14) involved in child prostitution for pedophiles, with a drug addicted mother, while trying to live a normal life in school.But when his mother dies early on of a heroin overdose, he runs away from authorities rather than risk a foster placement.  Dylan Walsh notices him at thepolice station where he appears to be involved in some drug deal, and it appears he has some shady involvements.  Later, the boy meets up by accident withWalsh at a diner, and a slow uneasy relationship develops between them that is the central theme of the film.  While ""Nathan"" claims he has a father inVancouver and wants a ride there, he really is looking for a father figure.  From that point the movie has many excellent moments and scenes, and leadsto a very emotional and satisfying climax.  I especially enjoyed the scenes in ""Boon's"" home town, where he meets an old flame, and her son and Nathanbecome friends.  The relationship between the two teens is very believable, as are the other two boys, one gay, who they meet up with.  Also Boon's relationshipwith his once girlfriend shows us a soft side to him.  Rather than give more of the plot, I will say what I think is the one thing that makes the filmhard to believe.  That is that Nathan, despite his horrific past and circumstances, is such a good kid, and wants to be.  When he says to the girlfriendsson's friend, ""I just want to be a good kid"", it is a highlight of the film.  I just find it hard to believe that any kid who has lived as he has would have thewherewithall to not have succumbed more to the environment he was growing up in.  Branden Nadon reminds me of the kind of 8th graders I grew up with, inmy nice upper middle class neighborhood in the 50's.  However, if Nathan were like I would have expected, the movie would not be the great story it was.Perhaps more realistic, but ultimately angry and depressing.  So since I like to see films that leave me feeling good rather than depressed, I am gladto give this film a top rating, as I did on IMDB too.  It is one of my 10 favorites (out of 500 owned and nearly 3000 seen) and definitely the best cableTV film I have ever seen.",5,Wow!
