1517857,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B006O94DKO,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[9, 10]","Be afraid of the next Gundam series... The art is pretty... interesting.  Gundam AGE looks like Pokemon in space.  So while you can, pick up a copy of Gundam 00 and enjoy the wonderful, more grown up look to this series.I will leave this brief review spoiler free.  The story picks up a little after the events in the first half of the series (Mobile Suit Gundam 00: The Complete First Season).  I actually bought the second season when it briefly dropped to $29.99 (from Amazon w/Prime shipping).  I got lucky.The story line takes a different path in this half, but we see many of the same characters as in the first half.  Again, no spoilers, but if you have finished the first half (which you should have before watching this half), then you know some people were lost.  There are a few new characters introduced, and others take a more central role in the story.  I think that Saji's character becomes one of the more interesting characters in a Gundam series yet.The animation is top caliber.  The series was set up for HD, and was the first Gundam series to be animated with HD viewing in mind.  Sadly, this release is currently only available on DVD, but even in standard definition, the animation is crisp and clean.  The lines are so precisely drawn and the computer editing and animation is flawless.The audio is quite phenomenal as well.  Sound effects are realistic and the mixing is such that they don't suddenly 'boom' and disturb neighbors.  The Japanese audio is fantastic.  Sunrise takes great pride in casting voice talent, and the voice actors are matched perfectly to their roles.  The English dubbing is along the lines of previous Gundam series, just decent.  If you can't stand reading subtitles, then I guess the English dub would suffice; but I highly recommend watching at least once with the Japanese audio track.  The music is stellar as usual.  Sunrise added some great tracks, and though the opening and closing songs aren't quite as good as the first season (L'Arc en Ciel and Brilliant Green both rocked the openings); one of my favorite Jpop bands, Stereopony, does have the fourth intro song and UverWorld has the third intro song.  Both are very good, just not as rockstar as the first and second.Something I might point out.  The Gundam series now is standing a bit above other mecha series.  Part of this is the realistic future aspect of the series.  Sunrise hired several consultants for this project.  If you look at the credits, they have engineering consultants, physics consultants, and science fiction authors consulting.  Pretty amazing that this studio is taking this franchise so seriously.  Though it does make one wonder what they were thinking with Gundam AGE and the Pokemon/Eureka Seven look...This, to me, is the future of hand drawn / computer aided and edited animation.  A remarkable series for story line and presentation.  If you are a fan of the giant robot / mecha anime, then this is a stunning addition to the genre.  Even for those who haven't gotten into mecha anime might give this series a whirl.  It's remarkable for being more than just robot fighting.  We have a rock solid story, amazing characters, flawless animation, and a realistic future setting.  Buy and enjoy watching many times.",5,A fitting end to one of the best Gundam series yet ~,1346457600,"09 1, 2012",2012,3257,"['Be', 'afraid', 'next', 'Gundam', 'series', 'art', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'Gundam', 'AGE', 'Pokemon', 'space', 'So', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'Gundam', '00', 'enjoy', 'wonderful', 'more', 'grown', 'up', 'look', 'series.I', 'will', 'leave', 'brief', 'review', 'spoiler', 'free', 'story', 'up', 'little', 'events', 'first', 'half', 'series', 'Mobile', 'Suit', 'Gundam', '00', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'actually', 'bought', 'second', 'season', 'when', 'briefly', 'dropped', '29.99', 'Amazon', 'w/Prime', 'shipping', 'got', 'lucky.The', 'story', 'line', 'different', 'path', 'half', 'see', 'many', 'same', 'characters', 'first', 'half', 'Again', 'spoilers', 'have', 'finished', 'first', 'half', 'should', 'have', 'watching', 'half', 'then', 'know', 'people', 'were', 'lost', 'are', 'few', 'new', 'characters', 'introduced', 'others', 'take', 'more', 'central', 'role', 'story', 'think', 'Saji', 'character', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Gundam', 'series', 'yet.The', 'animation', 'top', 'caliber', 'series', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'HD', 'was', 'first', 'Gundam', 'series', 'be', 'animated', 'HD', 'viewing', 'mind', 'Sadly', 'release', 'currently', 'only', 'available', 'DVD', 'even', 'standard', 'definition', 'animation', 'crisp', 'clean', 'lines', 'are', 'so', 'precisely', 'drawn', 'computer', 'editing', 'animation', 'flawless.The', 'audio', 'quite', 'phenomenal', 'well', 'Sound', 'effects', 'are', 'realistic', 'mixing', 'such', 'do', ""n't"", 'suddenly', ""'boom"", 'disturb', 'neighbors', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'fantastic', 'Sunrise', 'great', 'pride', 'casting', 'voice', 'talent', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'matched', 'perfectly', 'roles', 'English', 'dubbing', 'lines', 'previous', 'Gundam', 'series', 'just', 'decent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'then', 'guess', 'English', 'dub', 'would', 'suffice', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'least', 'once', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'track', 'music', 'stellar', 'usual', 'Sunrise', 'added', 'great', 'tracks', 'opening', 'closing', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'season', ""L'Arc"", 'en', 'Ciel', 'Brilliant', 'Green', 'rocked', 'openings', 'one', 'favorite', 'Jpop', 'bands', 'Stereopony', 'have', 'fourth', 'intro', 'song', 'UverWorld', 'third', 'intro', 'song', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'rockstar', 'first', 'second.Something', 'might', 'point', 'out', 'Gundam', 'series', 'now', 'standing', 'bit', 'other', 'mecha', 'series', 'Part', 'realistic', 'future', 'aspect', 'series', 'Sunrise', 'hired', 'several', 'consultants', 'project', 'look', 'credits', 'have', 'engineering', 'consultants', 'physics', 'consultants', 'science', 'fiction', 'authors', 'consulting', 'Pretty', 'amazing', 'studio', 'taking', 'franchise', 'so', 'seriously', 'make', 'one', 'wonder', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'Gundam', 'AGE', 'Pokemon/Eureka', 'Seven', 'look', 'future', 'hand', 'drawn', '/', 'computer', 'aided', 'edited', 'animation', 'remarkable', 'series', 'story', 'line', 'presentation', 'are', 'fan', 'giant', 'robot', '/', 'mecha', 'anime', 'then', 'stunning', 'addition', 'genre', 'Even', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'mecha', 'anime', 'might', 'give', 'series', 'whirl', 'remarkable', 'being', 'more', 'just', 'robot', 'fighting', 'have', 'rock', 'solid', 'story', 'amazing', 'characters', 'flawless', 'animation', 'realistic', 'future', 'setting', 'Buy', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'many', 'times']",Mobile Suit Gundam 00: Season 2

The animation and soundtrack fit nicely together and the Japanese voice cast did a great job and while the English voice cast were 90% great there was that 10% we could have done without.  Also just a heads up on the video format,  I really don't know why Amazon has the video as standard but in actuality the format is widescreen(1.78:1).  Also while the case for the set is somewhat cheap for $30.00 dollars for the entire second season I'm more then willing to overlook this, don't really expect much on the extras as all you're going to get are the usual trailers and the like.
