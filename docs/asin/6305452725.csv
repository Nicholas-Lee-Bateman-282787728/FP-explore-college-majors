465386,AY6XIORKYRD3M,6305452725,"""darc_light""","[2, 3]","I really enjoyed DRAGONBALL Z: CAPTAIN GINYU: ASSAULT. The characters are ridiculously funny, espescially The Ginyu Force with their obssession with posing and style. Jeice happens to be my favorite character, with his punk-rock hairdo and Australian accent, I'm not sure if he was voiced by Scott McNeil or Christopher Sabat in this version, but whoever it was, they did an awesome job. Unfortunately I can't say the same for Goku and Vegeta's voices, Goku sounded boring, and Vegeta just didn't sound quite right, too much gravel and grating. And of course I didn't like Vegeta killing Burter and Recoome when they were unconscious and helpless, Vegeta's a sadist, and I hate him anyway, he killed Zarbon and he later kills Jeice when he's begging for mercy, which really upsets me, [but that's another video]. And the sight of Recoom's bare, ugly backside I could have easily, [and gladly], done without. The Ginyu Force was great, the other characters, weren't all done that well, Frieza was voiced by a woman [Linda Young?] and that took away alot of his scary factor, [not that women can't be just as vicious as men, but Frieza is a MALE character, it just doesn't sound right]. Captain Ginyu himself was hilarious, and Guru, Nail, and Dende where well done, if given only brief parts. And best of all, I finally got to see Jeice use his Orange Fire Ball Attack! The beutifully drawn scene of Jeice in orange silouhette , preparing to spike his Fire Ball like a volley ball, was one of the best scenes on the video! 5 Stars!",5,Jeice Fan,1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2002,1530,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'DRAGONBALL', 'Z', 'CAPTAIN', 'GINYU', 'ASSAULT', 'characters', 'are', 'ridiculously', 'funny', 'espescially', 'Ginyu', 'Force', 'obssession', 'posing', 'style', 'Jeice', 'be', 'favorite', 'character', 'punk-rock', 'hairdo', 'Australian', 'accent', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'voiced', 'Scott', 'McNeil', 'Christopher', 'Sabat', 'version', 'was', 'did', 'awesome', 'job', 'Unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'same', 'Goku', 'Vegeta', 'voices', 'Goku', 'sounded', 'boring', 'Vegeta', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'quite', 'right', 'too', 'much', 'gravel', 'grating', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Vegeta', 'killing', 'Burter', 'Recoome', 'when', 'were', 'unconscious', 'helpless', 'Vegeta', 'sadist', 'hate', 'anyway', 'killed', 'Zarbon', 'later', 'Jeice', 'when', 'begging', 'mercy', 'really', 'video', ']', 'sight', 'Recoom', 'bare', 'ugly', 'could', 'have', 'easily', '[', 'gladly', ']', 'done', 'Ginyu', 'Force', 'was', 'great', 'other', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'all', 'done', 'well', 'Frieza', 'was', 'voiced', 'woman', '[', 'Linda', 'Young', ']', 'took', 'away', 'alot', 'scary', 'factor', 'not', 'women', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'just', 'as', 'vicious', 'men', 'Frieza', 'MALE', 'character', 'just', ""n't"", 'sound', 'right', ']', 'Captain', 'Ginyu', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Guru', 'Nail', 'Dende', 'where', 'well', 'done', 'given', 'only', 'brief', 'parts', 'best', 'finally', 'got', 'see', 'Jeice', 'use', 'Orange', 'Fire', 'Ball', 'Attack', 'beutifully', 'drawn', 'scene', 'Jeice', 'orange', 'silouhette', 'preparing', 'spike', 'Fire', 'Ball', 'volley', 'ball', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'video', '5', 'Stars']","Dragonball Z, Vol. 18 - Captain Ginyu: Assault VHS"
465387,A2CLUVY0XTPRZK,6305452725,H. Thompson,"[1, 4]","INTRO:  First of all, I would like to mention the first thing a lot of people think when they see this DVD.  This is when the original company that held DBZ, Pioneer hands over the rights to the company in full to FUNimation.  This is a landmark decision as DBZ fans will now start seeing Japanese audio included on every DVD from this point on.  Thank Kami.PLOT:  Well, another 3 measily episodes from the series, for a unusually high price.  For individual episode reviews read the DVD description.AUDIO:  This is the 50/50 part.  Since FUNimation was just jumping onto the ""dubbing"" bandwagon, they terribly [stunk] at first (still do to a point).  The ONLY reason I bought this DVD was for the Japanese audio track, because when you listen to the dub, you'll probably cover your ears in shere agony.  DBZ's drawing isn't always the best, and when you have bad dubbing, it brings down the series drastically.  The only thing that the two audio tracks differ in is that the English audio track has Stereo, while the Japanese has basic mono.  Strange for a DVD, but I can live with it.VIDEO:  The video is a little granier than the rest.  FUNimation didn't spend a lot in restoring the video for this DVD.DVD:  The menus are ok, although most people don't like them.  They are quick, and to-the-point so I really like them though.EXTRAS:  THERE ARE NO EXTRAS!  Which I can understand because this was FUNimation's first DBZ DVD...they'll make up for it later with [poor] commercials.OVERALL:  Overall, I gave this a 3 because the video wasn't that great, there were no extras to speak of, and the price is a little high for 3 episodes (60 minutes about).  Most people won't pay more than [price] for a 60 minute movie, as most features today are at least 80 minutes or so.  But in the end, if you are a die-hard DBZ fan, and need higher quality Japanese language DBZ than your VHS fan subs, then this is recommended for you.  Others who are looking for great DVD + great show, look somewhere else.PS:  Although DBZ is one of my favorite shows, I will not admit there is better anime out there.",3,"From an Older, Experienced DBZ Fan",1029888000,"08 21, 2002",2002,2094,"['INTRO', 'First', 'would', 'like', 'mention', 'first', 'thing', 'lot', 'people', 'think', 'when', 'see', 'DVD', 'when', 'original', 'company', 'held', 'DBZ', 'Pioneer', 'rights', 'company', 'full', 'FUNimation', 'landmark', 'decision', 'DBZ', 'fans', 'will', 'now', 'start', 'seeing', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'included', 'DVD', 'point', 'Thank', 'Kami.PLOT', 'Well', '3', 'measily', 'episodes', 'series', 'unusually', 'high', 'price', 'individual', 'episode', 'reviews', 'read', 'DVD', 'description.AUDIO', '50/50', 'part', 'FUNimation', 'was', 'just', 'jumping', 'dubbing', 'bandwagon', 'terribly', '[', 'stunk', ']', 'first', 'still', 'do', 'point', 'ONLY', 'reason', 'bought', 'DVD', 'was', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'track', 'when', 'listen', 'dub', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'cover', 'ears', 'shere', 'agony', 'DBZ', 'drawing', ""n't"", 'always', 'best', 'when', 'have', 'bad', 'dubbing', 'down', 'series', 'drastically', 'only', 'thing', 'two', 'audio', 'tracks', 'differ', 'English', 'audio', 'track', 'Stereo', 'Japanese', 'basic', 'mono', 'Strange', 'DVD', 'can', 'live', 'it.VIDEO', 'video', 'little', 'granier', 'rest', 'FUNimation', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'lot', 'restoring', 'video', 'DVD.DVD', 'menus', 'are', 'ok', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'are', 'quick', 'to-the-point', 'so', 'really', 'though.EXTRAS', 'ARE', 'NO', 'EXTRAS', 'Which', 'can', 'understand', 'was', 'FUNimation', 'first', 'DBZ', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'make', 'up', 'later', '[', 'poor', ']', 'commercials.OVERALL', 'Overall', 'gave', '3', 'video', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'were', 'extras', 'speak', 'price', 'little', 'high', '3', 'episodes', '60', 'minutes', 'Most', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pay', 'more', '[', 'price', ']', '60', 'minute', 'movie', 'most', 'features', 'today', 'are', 'least', '80', 'minutes', 'so', 'end', 'are', 'die-hard', 'DBZ', 'fan', 'need', 'higher', 'quality', 'Japanese', 'language', 'DBZ', 'VHS', 'fan', 'subs', 'then', 'recommended', 'Others', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'great', 'DVD', '+', 'great', 'show', 'look', 'somewhere', 'else.PS', 'DBZ', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'will', 'not', 'admit', 'better', 'anime', 'there']","Dragonball Z, Vol. 18 - Captain Ginyu: Assault VHS"

I my self own the DVD and was pretty well known I spent my money on a good DVD. It even has the Japanese intro of  &quot;Cha-La Head Cha-La&quot;. What lacks for being a 5 /5 is the previews  for the next episode for both the English &amp; Japanese version which the  DVD does not contain. Also, the DVD needs to have more graphics and other  stuff to it to make it look good like movie DVD's with special features.  Anyways, DBZ rules on DVD with the subbtitle.
