One is the use of the language, except for one slip in the background it's true to the book and lends a flavor to the movie that makes it unique.  The direction of the horses running was strong and added tension.  I liked James Drury in a role and Dennis Weaver, a little reminiscent touch with Mr. Drury that was well done.  I liked the music score alot.  As you can tell, I liked the movie!  I read Owen Wister's book when I was in my early teens.  As it was written in the early 1900's, and the time of the story is about 15 years earlier, the language and depiction of life and the setting would be fairly accurate.

37184,AQE41QO3NEUMW,0780630068,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[3, 3]","""The Virginian"" has one of the most long-lived story lines in the history of western film. How it has evolved over the years from its origins in Owen Wister's novel (1902) is a story unto itself. The first ""literary"" western, based on Wister's own visits to the West in the 1880s, it became a wildly popular bestseller, was quickly made into a successful stage play, and then five movies and a long-running TV series. A few basic elements of the plot have remained more or less intact: the Virginian's long courtship of Molly, the independent-minded schoolmarm from back East; the hanging of his best friend; the conflict with his nemesis Trampas; the shoot-out at sundown; and the famous line, ""Smile when you call me that.""Bill Pullman's version is a lot closer to the original than the TV series, which played fast and loose with the material, but like every other version, it falls short of matching Wister's achievement. Pullman understands that the Virginian is a man of principle, honor, discretion, and remarkable patience. But his portrayal of these character traits makes him too stoic and flat. Wister's Virginian, still in his 20s, has a playful streak that gives him an irresistible, boyish charm. Pullman, unfortunately, is obviously twice that age, and without the youth of a younger actor he comes across as sometimes wooden.Diane Lane's Molly is actually closer to Wister's conception of her character, and actresses from the beginning have had trouble conveying her spirited independence without seeming either shrill or stubbornly comical. Though Wister makes a point of saying that Molly is not a ""New Woman"" (i.e. early feminist), she comes across that way anyway - prepared to live her life as a single woman if need be, and free to marry whatever man she chooses, regardless of his social station - in this case, an unschooled, low-born cowboy.In Wister's novel, there is an element of youthful willfulness to help account for her behavior. Diane Lane's portrayal of a woman somewhat past marrying age makes her independence plausible and even ""modern."" When she says she won't marry the Virginian if he kills Trampas, she means it, and unlike her predecessors, follows through on her promise. Pullman's Virginian has to go hat in hand to her and persuade her to reconsider. While Wister's ending has her retreating into helpless, all-forgiving love for her man, Pullman's Molly gets to hang on to her scruples about the ethics of gunning down another man in cold blood.A curious development in this version of the story is the elevation of the character of Balaam, a neighboring rancher who mistreats horses in the novel and represents corresponding weaknesses of character. Here, played by Dennis Weaver, he becomes a second villain, whom the Virginian must deal with in the final shootout with Trampas. For Pullman, Balaam isn't just a bad apple, but a representative of corporate greed. This is a modern development we see in other recent westerns - the crooked CEO of an agribusiness willing to stop at nothing to maximize profits. (Cf. ""Appaloosa"" and ""Open Range"".) This development extends the final confrontation scene, but is a major departure from Wister's novel. Having it all take place inside the saloon, instead of out in the street, also limits the potential for suspense (Cf. ""High Noon"".)Most agreeable about the film is its attempt to capture the open range of 1880s Wyoming. It portrays the sweeping beauty of the prairies, as well as the sense of isolation when people lived and worked so far from the nearest town or railroad. The music track in its haunting spareness is also very evocative, without the use of a big orchestra that was common in ""big"" westerns of the past. If you forget Wister and just watch the film as a low-keyed mix of frontier justice and love story, you shouldn't be disappointed, but treat yourself to the original sometime.
