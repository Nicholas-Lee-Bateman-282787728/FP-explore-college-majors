1180335,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B001DGZFEQ,Colleen M. Schneider,"[6, 6]","I enjoy Mari Windor's style and cuing of the moves.  I own her Basic 3 DVD set and find myself working Pilates into my workouts regularly.  There is nothing that will make a stomach flatter than some of the Pilates moves.  If you own a pilates dvd already you are probably familiar with many of these moves already.  The fun challenge is in getting in a little extra resistance for extra toning by using the pink resistance band that is included in the dvd.It took me a little while to get the placement of the band for some of the moves so it wouldn't slip off, but I enjoyed having a light toning workout that gave me a little extra resistance.The moves are basic and Mari's style is not too chatty, she gives you the move, you do some concentrated reps and you are on to the next move.  If you are working into the muscle correctly you don't need a million reps to get excellent results.This is NOT a sweaty workout-if you are looking for heart pumping action, this is not your kind of workout, but for me, as a daily exerciser this would be a workout that I would go to on one of my light workout days or as extra toning after I've been walking.Best of all, besides that nice flat tummy you'll get from frequent use?  $1.00 from each sale goes to Breast Cancer Research.",4,a light toning workout with band included!,1231977600,"01 15, 2009",2009,1274,"['enjoy', 'Mari', 'Windor', 'style', 'cuing', 'moves', 'own', 'Basic', '3', 'DVD', 'set', 'find', 'working', 'Pilates', 'workouts', 'regularly', 'nothing', 'will', 'make', 'stomach', 'flatter', 'Pilates', 'moves', 'own', 'pilates', 'dvd', 'already', 'are', 'probably', 'familiar', 'many', 'moves', 'already', 'fun', 'challenge', 'getting', 'little', 'extra', 'resistance', 'extra', 'toning', 'using', 'pink', 'resistance', 'band', 'included', 'dvd.It', 'took', 'little', 'while', 'get', 'placement', 'band', 'moves', 'would', ""n't"", 'slip', 'off', 'enjoyed', 'having', 'light', 'toning', 'workout', 'gave', 'little', 'extra', 'resistance.The', 'moves', 'are', 'basic', 'Mari', 'style', 'not', 'too', 'chatty', 'move', 'do', 'concentrated', 'reps', 'are', 'next', 'move', 'are', 'working', 'muscle', 'correctly', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'million', 'reps', 'get', 'excellent', 'results.This', 'NOT', 'sweaty', 'workout-if', 'are', 'looking', 'heart', 'pumping', 'action', 'not', 'kind', 'workout', 'daily', 'exerciser', 'would', 'be', 'workout', 'would', 'go', 'one', 'light', 'workout', 'days', 'extra', 'toning', ""'ve"", 'been', 'walking.Best', 'nice', 'flat', 'tummy', ""'ll"", 'get', 'frequent', 'use', '1.00', 'sale', 'Breast', 'Cancer', 'Research']",Pilates For Pink DVD

Ow, it hurts so bad.  I know there are people who enjoy that soreness, but not me.  On the other hand, I'm getting ready to grit my teeth and go after it, and keep doing it until I can do it without being so sore. The thing I love about it allows me to work lots of muscles in my legs without doing squats or lunges, which always hurt my knees.  So.  I think this is the right workout for me.  I just need to push through the soreness.",5,Ouch.

If the band isn't spread out AND you don't keep your feet separated at the toes (heels together) it HURTS because of the smushing feet together while pulling.  I had to reposition constantly and no, I don't think it will get better over time.  I want to exercise but not struggle with this thing.  This would NOT be a workout for heavy set people as you would never get positioned to do anything.  I sold this DVD back to Amazon.com.  There are SO many better DVD's to exercise with that are fun and easier to do for the legs and thighs BUT this one is NOT it.  Sorry....

I thought the band was too thin and it kept slipping off my feet.

1180340,A2MVNU5APLJ22,B001DGZFEQ,L. Miller,"[28, 28]","The Pilates for Pink workout has sections for upper body, lower body, and abs. There are separate workout options available on the DVD menu, or you can do them all together for a 50 minute workout. There is a pink exercise band included with the workout.Overall, I'm glad I bought it. The exercises combine traditional pilates matwork (hundreds, single leg stretch etc) with exercises that take advantage of the band and are meant to simulate reformer or other machine exercises. I didn't feel over tired afterward, but i did feel like I got good toning in. And even though it's 50 minutes or so and not terribly fast-paced, I didn't feel bored. The arm exercises were fun, but I won't know how effective they are until I've done the workout more. Overall, it's a good recommendation if you are just starting out, or if you have another pilates DVD or two and want some variety, but if you have other stuff from Winsor, I don't know how repetitive this one would be. It reminded me of the 10 minute solution slim and sculpt pilates, which also uses the band. So if you like one, you'll like the other.They give $1 to Breast Cancer for each purchase, so this would make a thoughtful purchase or gift anyway. If some of the money didn't go to cancer, I'm not sure I'd be willing to pay full price for it.",4,Very good!,1222819200,"10 1, 2008",2008,1302,"['Pilates', 'Pink', 'workout', 'sections', 'upper', 'body', 'lower', 'body', 'abs', 'are', 'separate', 'options', 'available', 'DVD', 'menu', 'can', 'do', 'together', '50', 'minute', 'workout', 'pink', 'exercise', 'band', 'included', 'workout.Overall', ""'m"", 'glad', 'bought', 'exercises', 'combine', 'traditional', 'pilates', 'matwork', 'hundreds', 'single', 'leg', 'stretch', 'etc', 'exercises', 'take', 'advantage', 'band', 'are', 'meant', 'simulate', 'reformer', 'other', 'machine', 'exercises', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'tired', 'afterward', 'i', 'did', 'feel', 'got', 'good', 'toning', 'even', '50', 'minutes', 'so', 'not', 'terribly', 'fast-paced', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'bored', 'arm', 'exercises', 'were', 'fun', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'effective', 'are', ""'ve"", 'done', 'workout', 'more', 'Overall', 'good', 'recommendation', 'are', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'have', 'pilates', 'DVD', 'two', 'want', 'variety', 'have', 'other', 'stuff', 'Winsor', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'repetitive', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'reminded', '10', 'minute', 'solution', 'slim', 'sculpt', 'pilates', 'also', 'band', 'So', 'like', 'one', ""'ll"", 'like', 'other.They', 'give', '1', 'Breast', 'Cancer', 'purchase', 'would', 'make', 'thoughtful', 'purchase', 'gift', 'anyway', 'money', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'cancer', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'pay', 'full', 'price']",Pilates For Pink DVD
