In this case I was pleasantly surprised.  All in all, a pretty good and interesting movie.  The acting was somewhat above average, had an interesting story, and kept my attention.

967619,A3IY28PW12MSVN,B000E3LGK6,Christine Wong,"[11, 11]","Although it lacks the polish and CGI of his latest efforts, ""Shaolin Soccer"" and ""Kung Fu Hustle,"" this movie was still hugely entertaining, especially if you like Chow's ""moleitau"" (nonsense humor).Chow plays Star Chow, a cop who goes undercover as a student in order to find a missing gun.  He is understandably annoyed, shouting at his senior, ""I wanted to be a cop so I didn't have to go to school anymore!""  He gets to display a huge range of hilarious, pissed-off expressions.  Plot is thin, but who cares: this movie is, after all, just a stage for Chow to show off his impeccable comic timing, slapstick, and nonsense humor.  The familiar supporting cast is also strong.Chow has to deal with a myriad of things as an undercover at school: professors that throw chalkboard erasers at him, student gangs and cliques, homework, tests, girls, etc.  This is great comic material and Chow rises to the occasion admirably.  There's a hilarious scene where he cheats on his Chinese history test by calling up the police station and asking the chief to give him the answers.This movie is not as accessible to Western audiences as Chow's latest movies ""Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle.""  It is still a very funny movie with lots of slapstick, but a lot of it is verbal comedy.  It's a lot funnier if you understand Cantonese because a lot of the comedy comes from Cantonese slang and Chow's intonation.  However, I've shown this movie to friends who don't understand Cantonese at all and they have all loved it.Bottom line: One of Chow's best.  This movie is a good example of why audiences love Chow and why he was one of the biggest HK box-office draws in the 90s (he still is a big box office draw).  He oozes winning charisma and charm.  Laugh-out-loud funny.

While the story may not seem like the greatest, Chow's brilliant comedy is on full dispay and the movie is very well directed by Gordan Chan.  After seeing this, I can't think of a better story than Stephen Chow being in school acting as an 18 year old.  It works better than you could ever imagine, mainly because this isn't you typical Wong Jing type of movie, though he did help to write the script and also produced the movie.  The great acting and directing combined with the comedy is what makes this so great.  Not just for fans of Hong Kong Cinema, it's for anyone who likes to laugh.  I fell out of my chair a few times.  Chow is never really looking for the gun so the plot kind of drags, but it's still a lot of fun, and the story comes together by the end.I could have used more action. and that is the only thing I was disappointed in.  The fights come in spurts about 30 seconds long and are fast and furious, just not long enough.Fight Back to School part 2 is an even better movie, but part 1 is a classic as well.4/5",4,"""I give this mobile phone to you.
