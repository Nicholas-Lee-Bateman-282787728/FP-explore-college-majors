Jeremy Sisto does a good job as Julius Caesar.  Richard Harris chews up the scenery in his role and Christopher Walken steals every scene he is in.  I really liked the way this movie was directed, as it went from one interesting scene to the next and there were no dull spots.  I also like the fact that they actually built all the sets and recreated ancient ROME, instead of using blue screen and CGI.  The marble floors, statues, drapes, the soldiers costumes all gave a sense of high quality production.  The movie was filmed in two countries.  Disregard the one star review below, that person must be a history snob.  It's too bad this movie was only released on cable and DVD, I think it would have been great to see this in the theater.  It's better then Alexander or some other recent historic movies.

844467,AB34G6VKP28L,B0002S93TO,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[1, 1]","Ancient Rome was a model for civilization that cultures have followed ever since. It was also entirely brutal and pagan, but when the Roman Empire took over much of the world, it allowed Christianity to spread through a common speech. Seventy years before a significant baby was born in a manger, Julius Caesar became one of Rome's most influential figures and fought his way into the history books.The law of Rome states that an army cannot march into the confines of the city. But the law means nothing to those with power. Lucius Sulla (Richard Harris) has just taken over the empire, marching his men into the senate and black listing all those who have opposed him in the past. Thousands are fleeing his heavy-handed regime, among them the father in law of Julius Caesar (Jeremy Sisto). In an attempt to save the man's life, Caesar is captured by Sulla's armies and imprisoned. Having heard of his legacy, Sulla has him brought in for trial. Liking the young man's impertinence, Sulla offers him the opportunity to live, if he will but divorce his ""tainted"" wife. Too passionately in love with his beloved to consider such a thing, Caesar adamantly refuses. Impressed by his frank adoration, Sulla allows him to go free, but then tells his general Pompey (Christopher North) to have Caesar assassinated in the morning.Instead of carrying through his command, Pompey gives his signet ring to the young man and tells him to flee the province. Caesar does as he is told, and returns several years after Sulla's sudden death. Pompey is now the voice of reason and force in Rome, much to the disappointment of the senators, among them Marcus Cato (Christopher Walken) and other ""men of the common wealth."" Rome's empire is threatened from all sides and Pompey, now Consul, takes an army to victory on the battlefield. Returning bathed in glory, his romantic eye falls on Julia (Nicole Grimaudo), Caesar's beloved and beautiful daughter. Their friendship has grown strong in the passing years, and he is not opposed to the marriage, but desires to accumulate something from it. Wanting to prove himself in battle and earn honor through victory, Caesar allows Julia to be married to Pompey in exchange for the use of his armies in Gaul, where a revolution has been sparked.While Caesar's name flows from every mouth in the empire, the senators are growing uneasy, knowing that he could easily overtake Rome and become the next dictator. Ultimately through loss, love, and triumph, Caesar will be turned against his dearest friend, betray his wife with a beautiful Egyptian temptress, and have his blood shed on the pages of history. This miniseries does an ample job of covering numerous years in the general's life. My only true complaint is that sometimes it can be confusing, since there's no direct implication of time passing, only mention of it in dialogue. One minute, Caesar is a bright-eyed youth, the next his hair is gray. It could have used a little polishing, but overall the production is very worthwhile, particularly if you want a crash course in Ancient History. It revolves around Caesar, which means that time spent with significant other individuals in the time period, such as Marc Anthony and Cleopatra, is limited, and leaves the audience hungering for something more.I found this production highly entertaining, very informative about the era, and generally acceptable, if sometimes very rushed. I would have liked more character development in his relationship with Cleopatra and the social implications that followed. But as it stands, Julius Caesar is an interesting glimpse into a bygone society.",3,Dishonest But Entertaining,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,3622,"['Ancient', 'Rome', 'was', 'model', 'civilization', 'cultures', 'have', 'followed', 'ever', 'was', 'also', 'entirely', 'brutal', 'pagan', 'when', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'took', 'over', 'much', 'world', 'allowed', 'Christianity', 'spread', 'common', 'speech', 'Seventy', 'years', 'significant', 'baby', 'was', 'born', 'manger', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'became', 'one', 'Rome', 'most', 'influential', 'figures', 'fought', 'way', 'history', 'books.The', 'law', 'Rome', 'states', 'army', 'can', 'not', 'march', 'confines', 'city', 'law', 'nothing', 'power', 'Lucius', 'Sulla', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'just', 'taken', 'over', 'empire', 'marching', 'men', 'senate', 'black', 'listing', 'who', 'have', 'opposed', 'past', 'Thousands', 'are', 'fleeing', 'heavy-handed', 'regime', 'father', 'law', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'attempt', 'save', 'man', 'life', 'Caesar', 'captured', 'Sulla', 'armies', 'imprisoned', 'Having', 'heard', 'legacy', 'Sulla', 'brought', 'trial', 'Liking', 'young', 'man', 'impertinence', 'Sulla', 'opportunity', 'live', 'will', 'divorce', 'tainted', 'wife', 'Too', 'passionately', 'love', 'beloved', 'consider', 'thing', 'Caesar', 'adamantly', 'Impressed', 'frank', 'adoration', 'Sulla', 'go', 'free', 'then', 'general', 'Pompey', 'Christopher', 'North', 'have', 'Caesar', 'assassinated', 'morning.Instead', 'carrying', 'command', 'Pompey', 'signet', 'ring', 'young', 'man', 'flee', 'province', 'Caesar', 'told', 'several', 'years', 'Sulla', 'sudden', 'death', 'Pompey', 'now', 'voice', 'reason', 'force', 'Rome', 'much', 'disappointment', 'senators', 'Marcus', 'Cato', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'other', 'men', 'common', 'wealth', 'Rome', 'empire', 'threatened', 'sides', 'Pompey', 'now', 'Consul', 'army', 'victory', 'battlefield', 'Returning', 'bathed', 'glory', 'romantic', 'eye', 'Julia', 'Nicole', 'Grimaudo', 'Caesar', 'beloved', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'friendship', 'grown', 'strong', 'passing', 'years', 'not', 'opposed', 'marriage', 'accumulate', 'something', 'Wanting', 'prove', 'battle', 'earn', 'honor', 'victory', 'Caesar', 'Julia', 'be', 'married', 'Pompey', 'exchange', 'use', 'armies', 'Gaul', 'where', 'revolution', 'been', 'sparked.While', 'Caesar', 'name', 'mouth', 'empire', 'senators', 'are', 'growing', 'uneasy', 'knowing', 'could', 'easily', 'overtake', 'Rome', 'become', 'next', 'dictator', 'Ultimately', 'loss', 'love', 'triumph', 'Caesar', 'will', 'be', 'turned', 'dearest', 'friend', 'betray', 'wife', 'beautiful', 'Egyptian', 'temptress', 'have', 'blood', 'shed', 'pages', 'history', 'ample', 'job', 'covering', 'numerous', 'years', 'general', 'life', 'only', 'true', 'complaint', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'direct', 'implication', 'time', 'passing', 'only', 'mention', 'dialogue', 'One', 'minute', 'Caesar', 'bright-eyed', 'youth', 'next', 'hair', 'gray', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'polishing', 'production', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'particularly', 'want', 'crash', 'course', 'Ancient', 'History', 'Caesar', 'time', 'spent', 'significant', 'other', 'individuals', 'time', 'period', 'such', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'Cleopatra', 'limited', 'audience', 'hungering', 'something', 'more.I', 'found', 'production', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'very', 'informative', 'era', 'generally', 'acceptable', 'sometimes', 'very', 'rushed', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'relationship', 'Cleopatra', 'social', 'implications', 'followed', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'interesting', 'glimpse', 'bygone', 'society']",Julius Caesar

I must admit, I was a bit worried being that it was a TV miniseries but I queued it up on Netflix regardless. About 14 minutes into the film, I realized what set this apart from other movies based on history or that attempt to portray historical situations. Julius Caesar is not an easy topic, despite the information we have on him, yet this series pulled it off with stars and stripes.People have claimed, in these reviews, that Jeremy Sisto did not do that great of job. I believe I am a more critical...critic in that I had high expectations considering that I would never want to see him outside his role in Six Feet Under as the crazed Billy. Nonetheless, his performance grew from miniseries appropriate to bigscreen legend. In the beginning, Caesar is played as a humble man who gets in much trouble still trying to find out his destiny yet when he does find his destiny, Sisto conveys everything you'd hope: a passion for Rome and also some bit of grandeur for himself. I would give his performance 5 stars alone.Not to mentioned Harris, Walken, and Noth who were all very shocking in the performance (in the good way). I had high expectations of all these but especially Noth who I had never imagined in a role other than that of our trusty detective in Law and Order. I was surprised with how well he played the role of Pompeyy.The only problem I have with this is that there never go into any mention of Octavian (Augustus) as Julius' heir. They do mention him only once near the end of the film but nothing to do with adoption. I can see why this was so, as to not distract from Julius Caesar himself, but it would have been nice regardless.I recommend to any of those who are interested in a surprisingly good film and who appreciate actors who are not known for their huge blockbuster films, yet still do a better job in some cases.",5,"Et Tu, Brute?",1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,1991,"['one', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'excellent', 'sort', 'etertainment', 'movie', 'enthusiast', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'interested', 'Roman', 'History', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'bit', 'worried', 'being', 'was', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'queued', 'up', 'Netflix', 'regardless', '14', 'minutes', 'film', 'realized', 'what', 'set', 'apart', 'other', 'movies', 'based', 'history', 'attempt', 'portray', 'historical', 'situations', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'not', 'easy', 'topic', 'information', 'have', 'yet', 'series', 'pulled', 'off', 'stars', 'stripes.People', 'have', 'claimed', 'reviews', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'believe', 'am', 'more', 'critical', 'critic', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'considering', 'would', 'never', 'want', 'see', 'outside', 'role', 'Six', 'Feet', 'crazed', 'Billy', 'Nonetheless', 'performance', 'grew', 'miniseries', 'appropriate', 'bigscreen', 'legend', 'beginning', 'Caesar', 'played', 'humble', 'man', 'who', 'much', 'trouble', 'still', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'destiny', 'yet', 'when', 'find', 'destiny', 'Sisto', 'conveys', 'everything', ""'d"", 'hope', 'passion', 'Rome', 'also', 'bit', 'grandeur', 'would', 'give', 'performance', '5', 'stars', 'alone.Not', 'mentioned', 'Harris', 'Walken', 'Noth', 'who', 'were', 'very', 'shocking', 'performance', 'good', 'way', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'especially', 'Noth', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'imagined', 'role', 'other', 'trusty', 'detective', 'Law', 'Order', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'played', 'role', 'Pompeyy.The', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'never', 'go', 'mention', 'Octavian', 'Augustus', 'Julius', 'heir', 'do', 'mention', 'only', 'once', 'end', 'film', 'nothing', 'do', 'adoption', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'not', 'distract', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'regardless.I', 'recommend', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'film', 'who', 'appreciate', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'known', 'huge', 'blockbuster', 'films', 'yet', 'still', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'cases']",Julius Caesar
844469,A39UOZVRBZ2Q76,B0002S93TO,David Morrison,"[10, 14]","No one expects commercial films to portray ancient history accurately, and this is no exception. However, the film is largely true to the spirit of Rome at the end of the Republic, with outstanding sets and costumes.As noted by other reviewers, much is condensed or omitted. The central figure of Crassus, whose patronage was essential to Caesar's rise, is entirely absent. In effect, Crassus is merged with Pompey in this film, and the triumvirate of Pompey/Crassus/Caesar is reduced to a partnership between Pompey and Caesar. Also omitted is any direct reference to Spartacus, and here his Slave Revolt is merged with Pompey's campaign to clear the Mediterranean of pirates. At a more personal level, the film omits all references to Caesar's philandering (which included the mother of Brutus) as well as his balding with advancing age. And in this film Caesar is murdered in the old Senate-house in the Forum, not the new complex built by Pompey outside the city walls.On the positive side, Rome itself as depicted in the sets (mostly constructed in Malta, not digitally generated) is convincing: note that Rome in Caesar's time was largely built of brick and was not endowed with huge buildings or large open spaces. The military are also convincingly depicted, with the exception that the cavalry in the film use stirrups (but it is difficult today to find equestrian actors who can ride without stirrups). And there is much to please the sharp-eyed. For example, although the dialog does not mention Caesar's role as chief priest (Pontifex Maximus) and guardian of the Vestal Virgins, we see the Vestals officiating at his marriage to Calpurnia. And although the office of Consul is not really explained, we see the lectors and other paraphernalia in the background. Such details reward the careful observer.I do not agree with other reviewers who have written that ancient Rome is better depicted in such blockbuster films as Ben Hur, Quo Vadis and Gladiator. All of these tend toward hyperbole in sets and spectacle. Gladiator is highly accurate in its recreation of the Coliseum, but not in the Forum and other oversized public buildings. Ben Hur and Quo Vadis exaggerate even more: in the time (mid first century CE) when these two films are set, almost none of the great public buildings whose ruins still stand in Rome had yet been constructed. The most accurate film portrayal of the heart of imperial Rome is in The Fall of the Roman Empire, which faithfully follows what we know of the layout of the Forum and the Capitol. But that was the city more than two centuries after Caesar. For a glimpse of the Rome of the first century BCE, I enjoyed this TNT film.",4,Captures the spirit of late Republican Rome,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,2675,"['one', 'commercial', 'films', 'portray', 'ancient', 'history', 'accurately', 'exception', 'However', 'film', 'largely', 'true', 'spirit', 'Rome', 'end', 'Republic', 'outstanding', 'sets', 'costumes.As', 'noted', 'other', 'reviewers', 'much', 'condensed', 'omitted', 'central', 'figure', 'Crassus', 'patronage', 'was', 'essential', 'Caesar', 'rise', 'entirely', 'absent', 'effect', 'Crassus', 'merged', 'Pompey', 'film', 'triumvirate', 'Pompey/Crassus/Caesar', 'reduced', 'partnership', 'Pompey', 'Caesar', 'Also', 'omitted', 'direct', 'reference', 'Spartacus', 'here', 'Slave', 'Revolt', 'merged', 'Pompey', 'campaign', 'clear', 'Mediterranean', 'pirates', 'more', 'personal', 'level', 'film', 'references', 'Caesar', 'philandering', 'included', 'mother', 'Brutus', 'as', 'well', 'balding', 'advancing', 'age', 'film', 'Caesar', 'murdered', 'old', 'Senate-house', 'Forum', 'not', 'new', 'complex', 'built', 'Pompey', 'city', 'walls.On', 'positive', 'side', 'Rome', 'depicted', 'sets', 'mostly', 'constructed', 'Malta', 'not', 'digitally', 'generated', 'convincing', 'note', 'Rome', 'Caesar', 'time', 'was', 'largely', 'built', 'brick', 'was', 'not', 'endowed', 'huge', 'buildings', 'large', 'open', 'spaces', 'military', 'are', 'also', 'convincingly', 'depicted', 'exception', 'cavalry', 'film', 'use', 'stirrups', 'difficult', 'today', 'find', 'equestrian', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'ride', 'stirrups', 'much', 'please', 'sharp-eyed', 'example', 'dialog', 'not', 'mention', 'Caesar', 'role', 'chief', 'priest', 'Pontifex', 'Maximus', 'guardian', 'Vestal', 'Virgins', 'see', 'Vestals', 'officiating', 'marriage', 'Calpurnia', 'office', 'Consul', 'not', 'really', 'explained', 'see', 'lectors', 'other', 'paraphernalia', 'background', 'Such', 'details', 'reward', 'careful', 'observer.I', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'written', 'ancient', 'Rome', 'better', 'depicted', 'such', 'blockbuster', 'films', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'Quo', 'Vadis', 'Gladiator', 'tend', 'hyperbole', 'sets', 'spectacle', 'Gladiator', 'highly', 'accurate', 'recreation', 'Coliseum', 'not', 'Forum', 'other', 'oversized', 'public', 'buildings', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'Quo', 'Vadis', 'exaggerate', 'even', 'more', 'time', 'mid', 'first', 'century', 'CE', 'when', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'set', 'almost', 'none', 'great', 'public', 'buildings', 'ruins', 'still', 'stand', 'Rome', 'had', 'yet', 'been', 'constructed', 'most', 'accurate', 'film', 'portrayal', 'heart', 'imperial', 'Rome', 'Fall', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'faithfully', 'what', 'know', 'layout', 'Forum', 'Capitol', 'was', 'city', 'more', 'two', 'centuries', 'Caesar', 'glimpse', 'Rome', 'first', 'century', 'BCE', 'enjoyed', 'TNT', 'film']",Julius Caesar
844470,A1TKYAYESYHIA2,B0002S93TO,"Elijah Chingosho ""Dr Elijah Chingosho""","[4, 6]","This is an entertaining film about Julius Caesar, one of the greatest men in history. The costumes were authentic and the speeches by Caesar and Marc Anthony were fantastic. There are some accounts that I found very interesting and generally accurate, such as the decisive battle of Alesia. The battle order of the Romans is well presented. The film managed to capture the atmosphere of the life during the period that Caesar lived.The film gives an account of the early life of Caesar up to the time that he was appointed to a five year term as Proconsular Governor of Transalpine Gaul (current Southern France) and Illyria. Not content with an idle governorship, Caesar started the Gallic Wars (58 BC-49 BC) in which he conquered all of Gaul (the rest of current France, with most of Switzerland and Belgium, effectively western mainland Europe from the Atlantic to the Rhine) and parts of Germania and annexed them to Rome.The film also shows the critical role played by Caesar in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. His conquest of Gaul extended the Roman territory. Caesar was responsible for the first Roman invasion of Britannia in 55 BC. Caesar is undoubtedly one of the greatest military geniuses of all time, as well as an astute politician and one of the ancient world's strongest leaders. In 42 BC, two years after his assassination, the Roman Senate officially sanctified him as one of the Roman deities.However, there are several instances of historical inaccuracies that have been well highlighted by several reviewers. Therefore, if you want to learn about Julius Caesar and are looking for an accurate historical account of his life and achievements, this is not the right film for you. After all, this is a Hollywood movie, with a commercial focus not historical interest.As far as the acting is concerned, I think Jeremy Sisto did an above average performance, which is not good enough when telling the story of one of the most famous men in recorded history.

844471,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B0002S93TO,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[16, 18]","Recently I saw Jeremy Sisto in a film in the cinema, and as my movie-going friend and I were dissecting the film afterward, we both were impressed with Sisto's performance, and tried to recall what we'd seen him in before. I remembered this production of Julius Caesar, but only after a while - Sisto's role in the other film (a light drama with a comedic edge) is very different from the epic, super-serious Julius Caesar.This production is a good one for a straight-to-television production. It is a four-hour miniseries (the television nomenclature equivalent for `epic'). It plays a bit loose with the historic progression, but keeps many of the broad strokes intact - Rome's trouble under Sulla, Caesar's early difficulties becoming established, his military alliance and familial partnership with Pompey, destined to falter; the conquest of Gaul and the march back to Rome, the fiery oratory of Cato, and the climactic death in the Senate.Caesar is a complex character, one who defies encapsulation in so short a span as four hours. Given that Caesar was surrounded by many equally intriguing characters, it is little wonder that productions about Caesar often fall victim to a particular interpretation. Sisto's performance, and Edel's direction, makes Caesar in some ways a walking statue - and this is not a necessarily inappropriate style. Caesar was very conscious of appearances and public perceptions, and took great pains to always appear in a certain fashion that would enhance his power and reputation. Sisto's Caesar does show such some emotional range, but this is often mitigated by `events of state'.Richard Harris, in one of his final performances as Sulla, puts in a much more dynamic performance, however brief; some may recall Harris as the wise emperor Marcus Aurelius in `Gladiator' a few years prior to this production, a very different role indeed from the ambitious, capricious and over-emotional Sulla. Christopher Walken as Cato also turns in an almost over-the-top performance (Cato and Cicero seem to be a combined character here, in some respects). Christopher Noth plays Pompey, but does so at extremes - he is either flat and ineffective, or overly emotional and ineffective. Noth has done good work elsewhere, but this is not one of his better pieces.The female characters in this production are largely marginalized; even the famous Cleopatra/Caesar affair in minimized. While the role of Cleopatra is often overplayed in the Caesar story, it does have a decided role. Also, the role of Augustus is completely missing.Filming was done in Malta and in Bulgaria, which brought in lots of locals into the production. A replica of the Roman Forum was constructed, which is an impressive piece of scenery. Also, the Gaul encampment, where Caesar overcomes Celtic warriors, is well constructed and visually powerful. German actor Heino Ferch plays the role of the Celtic leader with aplomb. In scenes where he appears, he steals the show so completely that no Caesar could resist.It is interesting that the television series, `Rome', is currently enjoying a major success with essentially the same time period. This could have been a great epic / mini-series; instead, it is passing fair. Costumes are great, sets and location good. The story line is interesting, even if out of sync with actual history. The performances are spotty but occasionally effective.

Starring Jeremy Sisto, it follows the life of the future Dictator of Rome from his relative obscurity to his death at the hands of his peers on the Senate floor on the Ides of March in 44BC.The story covers the highlights of Caesar's life including his exile during the rule of the cruel dictator Sulla, his patronage under the capable General Pompey, his brutal but victorious campaigns against Vercingetorix and the Gauls, and his love affair with the beautiful and scheming Egytian queen Cleopatra.  Caesar's great ambition ultimately lead to his own murder by members of the Roman Senate who fear his ascendency, but ironically bring about the rise of the Empire.There are many political complexities that are touched upon in this film that give a good idea of the kinds of power plays that lead to Caesear's rise and fall, many of them including betrayal and murder.  The film depicts the Gallic Wars in good detail and gives an understanding of the turmoil that faced the Roman Republic in its last years before the rise of the Empire.  Caesar is portrayed as a intelligent human figure who is struck down by tragedy and overcome with amibition which ultimately leads to his own death.  The irony of Caesar's murder is that it was ostensibly to preserve the Republic, but rather hastened the foundation of the Empire.

844476,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,B0002S93TO,Octavius,"[30, 50]","... and I don't need shallow films regarding Caesar's facinating life to bring me nearer to him. TNT's production of this mini-series on the life of Julius Caesar leaves much to be desired. This movie is essentially nothing more than a quasi-fictional novela of Caesar and therefore has little substance or historical accuracy. In addition to a contrived screenplay, terrible script, and literally countless historical inaccuracies, the mediocre acting of Jeremy Sisto as Caesar leaves nothing of worth to watch other than good but sparing performances by Richard Harris as Sulla and Christopher Walken as Cato.The character of Caesar is portrayed as oversympathetic because it ommits his lesser known actions that show how his sinister ambitions started at an early age.  The film portrays him as a blameless champion of the Roman proles when he was in fact, above all, a shameless opportunist and exhibitionist whose ancient noble family had lapsed into obscurity and poverty. An outcast in the patrician/noble circles, Caesar was anxious to attain political office by demaguoguery and populism if he had to.  He chose to affiliate himself with the popular but questionable politics of his uncle Marius and his father-in-law Cinna. Marius was a commoner and populist who had been exiled as a public enemy after attempting several violent but unsuccessful plebiscites in Rome. In an effort to recall Marius, Cinna attempted a failed coup d'etat in Rome and also fled as a public enemy. Cinna and Marius later joined in besieging Rome to overthrow the senatorial majority and so legitimize their impeachment of Sulla from his proconsular command in Asia Minor.  Having completed their siege, they proceeded to massacre their political opponents and fellow countrymen with impunity: killing the consul Octavius and placing his head on a pike on the Rostra. Undisturbed by the methods used by his relatives to attain political power, Caesar sought to profit from them instead by taking the office of High Priest made vacant by the suicide of its previous holder who wanted to avoid a sham trial. Julius Caesar was a shrude oppportunist who always appeared to be cordial and generous because it served his interests more than anything else. Despite being one of the greatest military geniuses in history as well as a generous patron to the poor, Caesar was a narcissist who loved to indulge himself in outrageous luxury. Caesar was also considered to be immorally promiscuous even by the Romans themselves  (i.e. Brutus' mother)! Caesar was known by his contemporaries for stooping to virtually any form of lechery to get what he wanted.  The kingdom of Bythnia was interestingly devised to Rome upon the death of Nicomedes who shortly before had enjoyed numerous and scandalous encounters with Caesar on various nights in his bed chambers.  Another example is him later preferring to continue collaborating with the sleazy tribune Publius Clodius Pulcher whom he knew to have been courting his second wife Pompeia.  He only divorced his wife to protect his public image with which he was even more obsessed than Pompey The Great. Both he and Pompey needed vast wealth as each loved to display great lavishness in order to surround himself with useful sycophants. Even Sulla himself was said to have read Caesar's dark motives early in 80 B.C. and to have been somewhat frightened of what he saw.  After Caesar daringly confronted him with grievences as to the political restrictions being imposed on him for his family's associations with the chief instigators of the civil war, Sulla was said to have exclaimed, ""Beware! I see the faces of one thousand Mariuses in this one boy!""  In short, Caesar was an overly ambitious political opportunist even by the liberal standards of his contemporaries who were intoxicated with political ambition already. He was a man who had few mores or ethics he was unwilling to part with if it could get him what he wanted even if the methods to be used were to the detriment of the--albeit imperfect--democratic institutions of his nation.As for the supporting cast, Sulla played by Richard Harris was also falsely portrayed.  Although Sulla was the arch-enemy of Marius, his proconsular post in Asia Minor against Mithridates was illegally removed from him by Marius who coveted the command for himself despite his being old, decrepid, and senile. Sulla eventually returned with his own army and entered Rome to restore order: the supporters of Marius and Cinna were in turn proscribed. Unlike Caesar who eventually bribed his way to permanent dictatorship, Sulla was appointed dictator due to real emergencies that he didn't really bring about.  Caesar's relatives Cinna and Marius had clearly started and lost the civil war and died with most of their supporters in full flight, dead, or under siege.  Sulla reorganized Rome's political institutions along more conservative lines to prevent the demagoguery of populists like Marius and Cinna from occurring again.  He also undertook legal reforms to limit corruption and the power of the tribunes in carrying out plebiscites to circumvent the Senate. Sulla was not the mad dictator as shown in the film lusting only for power and he wasn't murdered by his opponents. Sulla honorably resigned his post as dictator after one year in 81 B.C.  and died in 77 B.C. from a terminal illess and a wound he received while killing one of his creditors. The funniest character distortion in this film is that of Cato played by Christopher Walken.  The film makes Cato Uticensis a major political player as early as Sulla's dictatorship and that is quite comical since, when Sulla returned to Rome in 82 B.C. , Cato would have been a very young and unusual member of the Senate at only 13 years of age and not even wearing his toga virilis! The real Cato only became a power in Rome and the Senate over twenty years later as an outspoken opponent of the First Triumvirate and Caesar. The film instead makes him an opponent to Sulla and later Caesar played by 60+ year old Christopher Walken who never seems to age one bit despite the passage of over 30 years until Cato's stoically defiant suicide in Utica.One of the strangest choices in this film was to completely omit the existence of Marcus Licinius Crassus. This was unfortunate because Crassus' presence and eventual absence from Caesar's life is what brought him power and eventually forced him towards a final clash with Pompey and his supporters.  Crassus was the single biggest power broker in Rome who was continuously trying to outwit Pompey The Great's ambitions.  Caesar was a clever manipulator and often played Crassus against Pompey knowing of their animosities for one another.  Caesar was often the convenient mediator between the two and would help them make amends to suit his ends.  A good part of Caesar's safety and political advancements upon returning to Rome were due to Crassus probably even more than Pompey. Caesar was considered an enemy of the state after Sulla's dictatorship because of his family connections to Cinna and Marius and so most Roman aristocrats refused to associate with him or sponsor his political ambitions. Unlike Pompey whose recent noble lineage made him fear the scorn of the optimates and the nobility, Crassus was from the Licinii clan that had been well established since the Early Republic.  As with Pompey, Crassus had populist agendas opposed by the nobility's conservative elements but, unlike Pompey, he didn't fear the nobility's disapproval and backlash as much: he therefore had less problems than Pompey in parting with the optimates and supporting Caesar's populist agendas.  Crassus was indeed a huge political and financial backer for Caesar.  Plutarch notes that Caesar was about to find himself in dire straits with his creditors prior to going to his Spanish governorship and that it was Crassus who paid for a huge balance of 800 talents/19,200,000 sesterces. To put this amount into perspective, both Cicero and Caesar bought luxurious villas from Crassus on the Palantine (Rome's Beverly Hills so to speak) for no more than 2 million sesterces. Caeasar was in serious need of cash and would probably have been barred from his governorship if not his senatorial station had not Crassus quickly payed this vast sum.  Crassus had many mines and clients in Spain that seemed to be in jeopardy there due to Pompey having encroached himself there while fighting Sertorius.  Caesar needed cash that Crassus had conveniently available as he had problems in Spain where Caesar was to govern.  Caesar needed Crassus as a sponsor to appear more respectable in the Senate given his shady background.  Caesar's fortune was therefore really a product of his collaboration with Crassus more than anything else.  Caesar's importance in Roman affairs was rather minimal until Pompey and Crassus sponsored him.  It was primarily Crassus who was the power behind the First Triumvirate and it was mainly he who promoted Caesar's command in Gaul.  Both he and Crassus were the ones who sought to enfranchize Northern Italy. The film also attributes the victory against Spartacus to Pompey when it was unquestionably Crassus who ended the Slave Revolt: Pompey arrived with Lucullus at the last minute and did some mopping up. It was Crassus who had 6000 slaves from the revolt crucified from Capua to Rome along the Appian way and it was he who received an ovation for ending the Servile War, not Pompey: Pompey was simultaneously celebrating a full triumph for his defeat of Sertorius and Perperna in Spain which had nothing to do with the Servile War. Caesar later provided Crassus with over 4000 Gallic horsemen to help him in his disastrous Parthian campaign. Most important of all, the direct reason the Civil War erupted between the Pompeian and Caesarian factions was Crassus' untimely death in Parthia which completely dismantled his entire political clientelle and power base in Rome leaving a huge power vacuum in its mafiaesque republican system of clan patronage and syndication.  This is important because all classical sources on Crassus, even as negative as they are, agree that Crassus had by far the most influence and power in Rome even after Pompey and Caesar had surpassed him in actual liquidity. This means that Crassus had the vastest and most solid investments in the Republic and, most importantly, the most solid connections with persons of influence amongst the commercial equestrian and plebeian classes as well as the individually silent but politically numerous lower nobility in the Senate.  Upon his death, his youngest son Marcus was too young to take the reigns of his vast clientelle network and just fell in the ranks by joining Caesar along with most of his father's clients.  Had Crassus not died unexpectedly with his eldest son Publius at Carrhae, the radical political alignments by his dependents mainly to the Caesarian faction would probably not have happened and civil war with the Pompeians would have almost certainly been avoided.  The irony then of choosing to exclude Crassus as a character is that the film essentially shoots itself in the foot.  The film redacted the single most important cataclysm towards what amounts to be the climax of both the film and history: the clash between Caesar and Pompey's republican supporters.  What is comical is that the rushed and vacuous plot inserted in place of the history of Caesar and Crassus was not only historically ludicrous but was so poorly written that it simply failed to build up or accentuate any of the tensions it it had hoped to portray by making the redaction in the first place.The true political intrigue between the shady Caesar and his fellow triumvirs along with the tragic consequences for each of them is interesting enough as it is to make a great movie: I don't see how some historically illiterate low-ranked Hollywood TV writer could make it more interesting than that.  A film that would truly capture the 'Spirit of Late Republican Rome' and Caesar as one previous reviewer commented would not have excluded Crassus, beautified Caesar's sinister character, or reduced Roman history to an infantile depiction showing purely the settling of a personal grudge between Pompey and Caesar.  The film wouldn't try to fit the characters of real and fascinating historical figures into trite 2-dimensional television characters that are crudely drafted to meet the limited needs of its infantile screenplay.  A true film on the subject would instead take the challenge of the real Caesar and, with some reasonable liberties permitted, make a film that is accurate, interesting, revealing, and moving to watch concerning the life of one of the single most important founders of modern Europe and Western civilization.  Boiling his character and deeds down to the form of a contrived and almost purely fictional novela is beyond my comprehension.  The only reason I can see for doing something so reductive is that it was done to match the talent collectively possessed by all of those who were involved in devising the screenplay and in charge of the direction in this film.  This movie drowns in its anachronisms and historical inaccuracies that are not merely pardonable omissions or alterations but simply absurd distortions in events, situations, and characters. Even the equally absurd distortions in Kubrick's 'Spartacus' are pardonable simply on the outstanding script, acting, and direction of which this film has none to boast of.  In terms of acting here, the only performances that stand out are those by Richard Harris as Sulla and Christopher Walken as Cato and their cameos are simply too brief to make a real positive impact on this worthless pile of reel. Jeremy Sisto seemed too uncertain and shy to come across as a Caesar. Sisto doesn't even look anything like Caesar anyway as Caesar was described by ancient sources as having blonde hair. Caesar was said to be of generally frail health and certainly not Herculean in physique but he wasn't the worn out coat depicted in this film either. For these reasons, I wouldn't recommend this mini-series for a good film on Caesar. This production is even less faithful to Roman history than Howard Fast's 'Spartacus' and that's pretty bad: at least Fast had enough literary acumen to properly include Crassus in his story even though, at least by the poor standards of the writers in this film, he didn't really have to either I suppose.",1,"""I too can shelter myself under the favor and friendship of

For some odd reason, Hollywood makes better ROMAN EMPIRE movies than they do make ROMAN REPUBLICAN movies even though there are great stories that occured during the times of the Republic: like stories concerning Judas Maccabeus in the Apocrypha or the war with Hannibal written in 10 books by Livy.These four movies are unparalled for historical understanding and emotional detail: The Passion of the Christ (starring Jim Caviezel), Gladiator (starring Russel Crowe), and Attila (starring Gerard Butler).  And let's not forget Ben Hur (starring Charletan Heston)--although I didn't see this last movie yet, but I've heard that it is a first rate movie.  There is a great deal of historical drama in all of these wonderfully made movies; however, I strongly caution parents about letting their young children watching Gladiator and Attila--especially since the latter has quite a bit of lewd scenes in it.  Attila shows two large battle scenes that are better than anything in Julius Caesar or the new Spartacus film.  Attila is better than JC or Spartacus in terms of acting and scenery and action--it's seems so pointless that I wasted my time and money on Julius Caesar and the new Spartacus.Although I don't want to overly criticize the performance of Jeremy Sisto, it takes more than a cool and determined looking demeanor to walk in the shoes of Julius Caesar, or atleast to put on a good show of trying to be like Caesar.  The battles in Gaul (if you call those battles) were basically a joke and a half.  If your looking for the real Julius Caesar in this film, you will be sadly let down.  It's better to just watch the four great movies on the Roman times that I have just mentioned above.

844478,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B0002S93TO,Roger J. Buffington,"[10, 11]","This is a remarkably good film about one of history's great men.  This film features above-average acting and a storyline that is reasonably true to history, rather than a Hollywood puff piece.  The film begins with Caesar's confrontation with the dictator Sulla, and ends of course, with his historic assassination in the Senate.The thing I liked best about this film is that in my opinion it is a fairly realistic look at Julius Caesar.  It mostly does not try to glorify him (as did, for example, Colleen McCullough in her Masters of Rome series of books).  Nor does it demonize him.  The film shows that Caesar went to Gaul and provoked wars mainly for his own political purposes (to enhance his stature at home) and that when the Senate sought to call him to account, this is what motivated him to turn his army against Rome and essentially overthrow the Roman Republic.  These are not necessarily laudable acts, and the film does not gloss over these points.  The scenes of Caesar imperiously dictating harsh laws and proscriptions to the Senate show that by the time of his death, absolute power had indeed corrupted Caesar absolutely.The film has a much better attention to detail concerning Roman parapernalia such as the lictors who attended the Roman Consul, and other similar details.  Purists will appreciate this.Another excellent quality of this film is the casting and acting, both are excellent.  The acting is generally good.  Jeremy Sisto was criticized for his portrayal of Caesar, but I thought he did a reasonably good job.  Richard Harris absolutely nails the role of the Dictator, Lucius Cornelius Sulla.  Christopher Walken did fine as Cato, although this was not a major role in the film. Heino Ferch was a very convincing Vercingetorix (the King of the Gauls). I did not think that Jay Rodan was a convincing Mark Antony.  Overall, though, this film surprises with the performances that its generally excellent cast turns in.  This film is sufficiently good, in fact, that one why it was not a ""bigger"" film.  I have not enjoyed a film as much as this one in several years, causing it to merit 5 stars.The sets, acting, and DVD reproduction of this film are all excellent.  This film will satisfy those of us who seek historical accuracy in a film about one of history's great figures, but the storyline will similarly engage those who simply are interested in  good dramatic entertainment.  This one is highly recommended.",5,A really excellent film ... a look at one of history's great figures,1156291200,"08 23, 2006",2006,2450,"['remarkably', 'good', 'film', 'one', 'history', 'great', 'men', 'film', 'above-average', 'acting', 'storyline', 'reasonably', 'true', 'history', 'rather', 'Hollywood', 'puff', 'piece', 'film', 'Caesar', 'confrontation', 'dictator', 'Sulla', 'ends', 'course', 'historic', 'assassination', 'Senate.The', 'thing', 'liked', 'best', 'film', 'opinion', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'look', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'mostly', 'not', 'try', 'glorify', 'did', 'example', 'Colleen', 'McCullough', 'Masters', 'Rome', 'series', 'books', 'demonize', 'film', 'Caesar', 'went', 'Gaul', 'provoked', 'wars', 'mainly', 'own', 'political', 'purposes', 'enhance', 'stature', 'home', 'when', 'Senate', 'sought', 'call', 'account', 'motivated', 'turn', 'army', 'Rome', 'essentially', 'overthrow', 'Roman', 'Republic', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'laudable', 'acts', 'film', 'not', 'gloss', 'points', 'scenes', 'Caesar', 'imperiously', 'dictating', 'harsh', 'laws', 'proscriptions', 'Senate', 'show', 'time', 'death', 'absolute', 'power', 'had', 'indeed', 'corrupted', 'Caesar', 'absolutely.The', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'attention', 'detail', 'concerning', 'Roman', 'parapernalia', 'such', 'lictors', 'who', 'attended', 'Roman', 'Consul', 'other', 'similar', 'details', 'Purists', 'will', 'appreciate', 'excellent', 'quality', 'film', 'casting', 'acting', 'are', 'excellent', 'acting', 'generally', 'good', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'was', 'criticized', 'portrayal', 'Caesar', 'thought', 'did', 'reasonably', 'good', 'job', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'absolutely', 'role', 'Dictator', 'Lucius', 'Cornelius', 'Sulla', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'did', 'fine', 'Cato', 'was', 'not', 'major', 'role', 'film', 'Heino', 'Ferch', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'Vercingetorix', 'King', 'Gauls', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'Jay', 'Rodan', 'was', 'convincing', 'Mark', 'Antony', 'Overall', 'though', 'film', 'performances', 'generally', 'excellent', 'cast', 'film', 'sufficiently', 'good', 'fact', 'one', 'why', 'was', 'not', 'bigger', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'several', 'years', 'causing', 'merit', '5', 'stars.The', 'sets', 'acting', 'DVD', 'reproduction', 'film', 'are', 'excellent', 'film', 'will', 'satisfy', 'who', 'seek', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'film', 'one', 'history', 'great', 'figures', 'storyline', 'will', 'similarly', 'engage', 'who', 'simply', 'are', 'interested', 'good', 'dramatic', 'entertainment', 'one', 'highly', 'recommended']",Julius Caesar

No need to waste time on historical plot line, it is accurate as much as these things can be (many characters play diminished roles due to time constraints, its not an exhaustive history of the man, mind you). Other than Richard Harris' brief role the cast is questionable (at least the males) but the acting is there and competent. This isn't a masterpiece but a decent enough flick on the man. You see both sides of Caesar hopeful tyrant, brilliant tactician, man of integrity. But they do not allocate anytime towards political and social reform and progresses under his brief rule.
