That's a 12% failure rate. Because of that reason, I would not recommend ordering these.I did get replacement disks. The company I bought them from (Best TV Sellers)was very good at replacing them. I would highly recommend buying DVDs from them.

1263110,A15WHX97ESO9JG,B002DC3FFK,Jesse Wayne,"[0, 0]","Have you laughed at a TV sit-com because it was funny, without an invasive laugh track? Well, Corner Gas is the one (and possibly only) series where you will not hear laughter when a cast member merely enters a scene. The Canadian cast members are exquisite in their roles and are recipients of Canada's top acting awards. Every episode is unique and you'll be hard pressed to quess the plot, unlike Anerican TV where all is telegraphed to you in the first two minutes. I've often said this series is reminiscent of the Laurel & Hardy comedies, where after countless viewings you'll still laugh your butt off. It's a must-have for any DVD collection.

It's clean and suitable for the whole family.  This show is often said to be the Canadian equivalent of Seinfeld...if so it's just because of how well you get to know and love the characters and how well it's written.  I think you could make an analogy with ""The Office"" - again, well written, clean, and no stupid laugh tracks!",5,One of the best TV shows of all time,1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,412,"['Very', 'clever', 'writing', 'very', 'funny', 'Everything', 'just', 'together', 'show', 'clean', 'suitable', 'whole', 'family', 'show', 'often', 'said', 'be', 'Canadian', 'equivalent', 'Seinfeld', 'just', 'how', 'well', 'get', 'know', 'love', 'characters', 'how', 'well', 'written', 'think', 'could', 'make', 'analogy', 'Office', 'again', 'well', 'written', 'clean', 'stupid', 'laugh', 'tracks']",Corner Gas: Season 1 - 6

Too bad Brent Butt's follow-up sitcom, ""Hiccups"", isn't as amusing, since the small-town charm is completely lost.  Corner Gas is, essentially, the real-life enactment of ""King of the Hill""--well-written stories about small-town life, albeit in two different countries.  Corner Gas has the added element of making Americans aware about the eccentricities of Canadian life, something no previous Canadian series has been able to accomplish (save ""SCTV"").
