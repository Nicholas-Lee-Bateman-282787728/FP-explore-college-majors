810934,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0001ME57Q,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","In 1988, Krzysztof Kieslowski gave us two `short films' about opposite yet connected subjects, love and violence.  For me, the more effective of the two is clearly his film about love.  Delving into the subject of isolation, loneliness and obsession as a way to exploit and expound upon the very human emotion, love, Kieslowski develops a truly inspired and impactful film.In the film we meet 19 year-old Tomek, an orphaned teen who relieves his loneliness by spying on Magda, an older woman living in an apartment visible from his own.  He watches her as she takes on lovers and he fills his imagination with the vision of her.  He lives with a friend's mother, works at a post office and pretty much thinks of nothing other than Magda.  He tries to find ways to be united with her, his attempts growing stronger until he does find himself face to face with the opportunity he's been seeking all along.But, like all of Kieslowski's films, this is not a simple film and the finale is not what one may expect.  Because of this, it works.  There is a deepened understanding of love brought to the film thanks to Kieslowski's unconventional exploration of this particular theme.  Tomek is such a fleshed out character, an entity who defines a feeling in ways that we wouldn't normally expect.  This is such an insightful look at a theme we often see romanticized but rarely see depicted with such raw detachment, adding a layer of honesty and crushing realism to the proceedings.Olaf Lubaszenko is astonishingly good!",5,An insightful love letter...,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,1514,"['1988', 'Krzysztof', 'Kieslowski', 'gave', 'two', 'short', 'films', 'opposite', 'yet', 'connected', 'subjects', 'love', 'violence', 'more', 'effective', 'two', 'clearly', 'film', 'love', 'Delving', 'subject', 'isolation', 'loneliness', 'obsession', 'way', 'exploit', 'expound', 'very', 'human', 'emotion', 'love', 'Kieslowski', 'truly', 'inspired', 'impactful', 'film.In', 'film', 'meet', '19', 'year-old', 'Tomek', 'orphaned', 'teen', 'who', 'loneliness', 'spying', 'Magda', 'older', 'woman', 'living', 'apartment', 'visible', 'own', 'lovers', 'imagination', 'vision', 'friend', 'mother', 'post', 'office', 'pretty', 'much', 'thinks', 'nothing', 'other', 'Magda', 'find', 'ways', 'be', 'united', 'attempts', 'growing', 'stronger', 'find', 'face', 'face', 'opportunity', 'been', 'seeking', 'along.But', 'Kieslowski', 'films', 'not', 'simple', 'film', 'finale', 'not', 'what', 'one', 'may', 'expect', 'deepened', 'understanding', 'love', 'brought', 'film', 'thanks', 'Kieslowski', 'unconventional', 'exploration', 'particular', 'theme', 'Tomek', 'such', 'fleshed', 'out', 'character', 'entity', 'who', 'feeling', 'ways', 'would', ""n't"", 'normally', 'expect', 'such', 'insightful', 'look', 'theme', 'often', 'see', 'romanticized', 'rarely', 'see', 'depicted', 'such', 'raw', 'detachment', 'adding', 'layer', 'honesty', 'crushing', 'realism', 'proceedings.Olaf', 'Lubaszenko', 'astonishingly', 'good']",N/A
810935,AT1KBARDWYQ9N,B0001ME57Q,Andromeda,"[3, 5]","This is a very touching film about a woman who discovers the real meaning of love from a young boy who stalks her because he thinks he has no chance with her.  He sees her with her boyfriend and wishes it could be him, but the difference is that he seems to care more about her feelings than her body.  This is something she has never experienced, being a contemporary woman of the world.  Sadly, this love is doomed but then it makes you think, can the true romantic love as in the notion of chivalry exist in the real world.  Perhaps love truly is not so much a reality as a virtue to which one aspires.

810936,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0001ME57Q,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 3]","The only criticism I would have of this enthralling Polish language film by the great Polish-French director Krzysztof Kieslowski is his use of the ""opened window"" conceit.  Magda (Grazyna Szapolowska) is a woman who lives alone in a high rise housing development.  She is sexy and cynical to the point of not believing in love.  To her it is all desire, and the fulfillment or frustration of desire.  Across the way from her lives a virginal young man by the name of Tomek (Olaf Lubaszenko) who has been spying on her from his apartment window through a telescope.He lives with a friend's mother (Stefania Iwinska) who looks after him as her own son.  He works in the post office and obsesses about Magda's life.  He watches her with her beaux.  He even goes so far as to write a couple of phony money order slips for her and put them in her mailbox just so she will have to go to his window and ask about them.  When she does he is able to examine her features closely.  Is his an obsession or is it love?  Kieslowski's answer is that it is love, love with the kind of depth and feeling that Magda cannot even imagine until she experiences it.  And then she is amazed and dumbfounded.The key scene in the movie occurs when Tomek is finally able to be together with the object of his love, in her apartment, with her telling him that ""When a woman wants a man she gets wet inside.""  And she invites him to check it out, so to speak.  But what happens does not lead to any kind of fulfillment.  Instead Tomek is inadvertently humiliated.And that's the story, more or less.  As usual with Kieslowski, human feelings predominate and are stark and one might say conflicted--the conflict arising between humankind's baser instincts and the more civilized ones of society.  What he does here is turn the stalker into the saint, in a sense, and the object of his love into something unworthy of that love.The question might arise: is it realistic to believe that a woman would leave her windows open and her lights on for all to see inside while she goes about her private life?  No, it isn't.  But we have to accept this device.  After that the film is fully realistic to the point of even being mundane in its depiction of middle class city life.  The characters are ordinary and even a little boring except for Tomek's supreme obsession.  It is this ""jewel"" in the heart of the Polish city that lifts his life and her life above the ordinary.  Even though we know that she is too old and too world-weary for him and that he is too hopelessly young and inexperienced for her for lasting love to ever bloom between them, we cannot help but think how wonderful it would be if we could all feel as he does, or be the object of such love.Usually when this theme is worked out it is the obsessed who suffer greatly, it is the obsessed who are to be pitied--and we do to some extent feel something close to that for Tomek.  But here it is Magda who we end up pitying the more because of her inability to love.  Compared to Tomek she is a deprived creature who will never find true happiness--unless she learns this lesson she has gotten from this young man whose passion for her was unlike anything she had ever experienced before.And this is Kieslowski's point: it is not only better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.  It is only through love that we can truly identify with another human being.  We see this in the scene where Madga is looking through Tomek's telescope into her apartment window and recalling what he had seen one day, the day that she had come home and spilled the milk and sat at the table crying over that spilled milk (very typical of Kieslowski to use such an obvious, but telling and entirely apt cliche) after a breakup with one of her boyfriends.  In memory she sees Tomek looking at her crying and running her finger through the spilled milk, and she realizes the depth of his commiseration with her and his love for her, and in her mind's eye she sees him beside her (as he truly was psychologically) with his hand on her shoulder and love in his heart.We might think that at some other time she will look back on a relationship she had had in her life and realize that the failure was due to a lack of love on her part.  Indeed she more or less reveals that to us when she tells Tomek's ""Godmother"" that no, she is not the right person for Tomek.  We know that she is too cynical and would only use him temporarily for gratification, and that would be all.But I was left with the sense that Magda would indeed learn from her experience and would be transformed.  There is this sense of hope and the possibility of emotional and spiritual growth that is often seen in the films of Krzysztof Kieslowski.",5,Is it love or obsession?,1188432000,"08 30, 2007",2007,4743,"['only', 'criticism', 'would', 'have', 'enthralling', 'Polish', 'language', 'film', 'great', 'Polish-French', 'director', 'Krzysztof', 'Kieslowski', 'use', 'opened', 'window', 'conceit', 'Magda', 'Grazyna', 'Szapolowska', 'woman', 'who', 'alone', 'high', 'rise', 'housing', 'development', 'sexy', 'cynical', 'point', 'not', 'believing', 'love', 'desire', 'fulfillment', 'frustration', 'desire', 'way', 'lives', 'virginal', 'young', 'man', 'name', 'Tomek', 'Olaf', 'Lubaszenko', 'who', 'been', 'spying', 'apartment', 'window', 'telescope.He', 'friend', 'mother', 'Stefania', 'Iwinska', 'who', 'own', 'son', 'post', 'office', 'Magda', 'life', 'beaux', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'write', 'couple', 'phony', 'money', 'order', 'slips', 'put', 'mailbox', 'just', 'so', 'will', 'have', 'go', 'window', 'ask', 'When', 'able', 'examine', 'features', 'closely', 'obsession', 'love', 'Kieslowski', 'answer', 'love', 'love', 'kind', 'depth', 'feeling', 'Magda', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'imagine', 'then', 'amazed', 'dumbfounded.The', 'key', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'Tomek', 'finally', 'able', 'be', 'together', 'object', 'love', 'apartment', 'telling', 'When', 'woman', 'man', 'wet', 'inside', 'check', 'out', 'so', 'speak', 'what', 'not', 'lead', 'kind', 'fulfillment', 'Instead', 'Tomek', 'inadvertently', 'humiliated.And', 'story', 'more', 'less', 'usual', 'Kieslowski', 'human', 'feelings', 'predominate', 'are', 'stark', 'one', 'might', 'say', 'conflicted', 'conflict', 'arising', 'humankind', 'baser', 'instincts', 'more', 'civilized', 'ones', 'society', 'What', 'here', 'turn', 'stalker', 'saint', 'sense', 'object', 'love', 'something', 'unworthy', 'love.The', 'question', 'might', 'arise', 'realistic', 'believe', 'woman', 'would', 'leave', 'windows', 'open', 'lights', 'see', 'inside', 'private', 'life', 'No', ""n't"", 'have', 'accept', 'device', 'film', 'fully', 'realistic', 'point', 'even', 'being', 'mundane', 'depiction', 'middle', 'class', 'city', 'life', 'characters', 'are', 'ordinary', 'even', 'little', 'boring', 'Tomek', 'supreme', 'obsession', 'jewel', 'heart', 'Polish', 'city', 'life', 'life', 'ordinary', 'Even', 'know', 'too', 'old', 'too', 'world-weary', 'too', 'hopelessly', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'lasting', 'love', 'ever', 'bloom', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'how', 'wonderful', 'would', 'be', 'could', 'all', 'feel', 'be', 'object', 'such', 'love.Usually', 'when', 'theme', 'worked', 'obsessed', 'who', 'suffer', 'greatly', 'obsessed', 'who', 'are', 'be', 'pitied', 'do', 'extent', 'feel', 'something', 'close', 'Tomek', 'here', 'Magda', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'pitying', 'more', 'inability', 'love', 'Compared', 'Tomek', 'deprived', 'creature', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'find', 'true', 'happiness', 'lesson', 'gotten', 'young', 'man', 'passion', 'was', 'anything', 'had', 'ever', 'experienced', 'before.And', 'Kieslowski', 'point', 'not', 'only', 'better', 'have', 'loved', 'lost', 'never', 'have', 'loved', 'only', 'love', 'can', 'truly', 'identify', 'human', 'being', 'see', 'scene', 'where', 'Madga', 'looking', 'Tomek', 'telescope', 'apartment', 'window', 'recalling', 'what', 'had', 'seen', 'one', 'day', 'day', 'had', 'come', 'home', 'spilled', 'milk', 'sat', 'table', 'crying', 'spilled', 'milk', 'very', 'typical', 'Kieslowski', 'use', 'such', 'obvious', 'telling', 'entirely', 'apt', 'cliche', 'breakup', 'one', 'boyfriends', 'memory', 'Tomek', 'looking', 'crying', 'running', 'finger', 'spilled', 'milk', 'depth', 'commiseration', 'love', 'mind', 'eye', 'truly', 'was', 'psychologically', 'hand', 'shoulder', 'love', 'heart.We', 'might', 'think', 'other', 'time', 'will', 'look', 'back', 'relationship', 'had', 'had', 'life', 'realize', 'failure', 'was', 'due', 'lack', 'love', 'part', 'Indeed', 'more', 'less', 'reveals', 'when', 'Tomek', 'Godmother', 'not', 'right', 'person', 'Tomek', 'know', 'too', 'cynical', 'would', 'only', 'use', 'temporarily', 'gratification', 'would', 'be', 'all.But', 'was', 'left', 'sense', 'Magda', 'would', 'indeed', 'learn', 'experience', 'would', 'be', 'transformed', 'sense', 'hope', 'possibility', 'emotional', 'spiritual', 'growth', 'often', 'seen', 'films', 'Krzysztof', 'Kieslowski']",N/A

I wanted to see more of his films but back in the 90's his films were no now where to be found in VHS or DVD. Now thanks to Criterion and Kino I have been able to collect his early works. The Dekalog is a Polish television series told in 10 parts influenced by The Ten Commandments. A Short Film About Love is an extended version of Dekalog VI. It does have a toach of Hitchcocks Rear Window but in this case it's just one window the main character is looking into with his telescope. The story is told in a tender single flash back. Who's flash back is it would be a good trivia question. I will not go into details about the story itself since you can read it in the other reviews. I only write this to highly recommand this film to does that are thinking about buying this dvd. The image on kinos dvd is very good.  the colors are a bit muted but it might how the film was shot.

True to its name, it is a simple story about a young kid called Tomek who falls in love with an older woman (Maria), who lives in the opposite building. Tomek spies on Maria with his telescope and knows her habits by heart. He even has an alarm set for 8:30 PM, which is right around the time Maria gets home.

Her reaction is fairly docile, but her boyfriend beats Tomek up.Tomek is unphased and this prompts Maria to approach him. Their interaction is thought provoking.
