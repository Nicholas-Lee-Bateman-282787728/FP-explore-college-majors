However, I would have enjoyed it more had there been a little more music and a little less talk.It was interesting to hear from the various musicians, and I wouldn't have changed that for the world.

1034838,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B000KJU1JG,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","Enjoyable, sweet, sometimes moving documentary about the lives and approaches to music of various members of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra.While a very good film, its not quite a great one, as it stays a little on the surface (it could actually use more running time). Plus talking in literal terms about one's feelings while playing music seems like it is sometimes simply hard to do for some of these musicians. So some of the stated insights seem obvious. (e.g. one has to subsume one's ego when playing in an orchestra).The sections where we see music (of a wide, appealing variety) played are well-photographed and absorbing.Certainly worth seeing, even if one could wish for more.",4,Lovely documentary about the lives of orchestra musicians,1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,692,"['Enjoyable', 'sweet', 'sometimes', 'moving', 'documentary', 'lives', 'approaches', 'music', 'various', 'members', 'Philadelphia', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra.While', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'great', 'one', 'little', 'surface', 'could', 'actually', 'use', 'more', 'running', 'time', 'talking', 'literal', 'terms', 'one', 'feelings', 'playing', 'music', 'sometimes', 'simply', 'hard', 'do', 'musicians', 'stated', 'insights', 'seem', 'obvious', 'e.g', 'one', 'subsume', 'one', 'ego', 'when', 'playing', 'orchestra', '.The', 'sections', 'where', 'see', 'music', 'wide', 'appealing', 'variety', 'played', 'are', 'well-photographed', 'absorbing.Certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', 'even', 'one', 'could', 'wish', 'more']",Music From the Inside Out
1034839,A3TPJOEN2CVO36,B000KJU1JG,S. A. Felton,"[35, 35]","I watched this incredible dvd several times in recent months, including one of theextras, which is a great radio interview of the filmmaker and the principal first andsecond violinists of the Philadelphia Orchestra. 5 stars isn't a high enough rating - thisis more than a must see for (classical) music lovers.In my experience this is a totally unique production. Interesting, entertaining, intimate,thought-provoking interviews of professional orchestral musicians are the main focus,interweaved with many scenes of the musicians in live performances, in rehearsals as an orchestraor in smaller groups, as well as in other venues, playing chamber music and also non-classicalmusic - I'll pass on the bluegrass, but the scene with the trombonist playing Latin music wasgreat! These fine musicians discuss their craft and music itself from many points of view. Theinterviews are done sometimes with only one musician, other times in groups. And of courseeither in the background, or in the foreground, we are always hearing great classical music.I felt like on some level I was really getting to know some of the musicians, through themagic of music, and because of the depth, directness, and honesty of their comments. Thereare so many inspiring, insightful comments, so much music packed in to this 90-minuteproduction, along with interesting travel footage of the orchestra in Europe and Asia.A few of the comments/scenes I noted:a) ""You can't define great musicianship, but you know when you hear it.""b) We might think that musicians are competitive (and they are sometimes!), and yet onthe dvd we hear otherwise. One violinist comments on how blown away he was when he heardSarah Chang play a Paganini concerto when she was nine. He and another musician express notenvy but are rather deeply inspired by her phenomenal talent.c) The amazing story of the concertmaster, David Kim, who didn't quite make it as asoloist, but still feels he has fulfilled the expectations of his deceased Mother. The music forthis entire scene is Schubert's Cello Quintet, which Kim calls ""pure ecstasy,"" and we feelthe same feeling in our own way, through the beauty of the music and the playing (he withother members of the orchestra).d) One of the percussionists makes a statement near the end of the dvd that musicexpreses something Divine.e) Another musician, who is also an artist, comments about the timelessness ofthe music, that playing (and listening) is like time-traveling, and she feels like sheknows the composers in some way.Words can't really convey the depth of the experience of watching this dvd, but Idon't think a person can appreciate it unless they like classical music. One other excellentproduction feature is the very visually-appealing, spatial arrangements of the musiciansduring rehearsals, so much more interesting than the normal look of an orchestra on stage.This is better than a 5-star production, but I would have appreciated it if thetitle of the pieces were displayed so I would know exactly what I was hearing (thoughsome of the pieces are recognizable). The names of the pieces are listed at the endof the main feature, but I think they omitted several, like the Debussey piece thatwas so well presented, along with an insightful explanation about connecting sounds andimpressions.As mentioned at the beginning of the review, one of the extras, the radio interview ofthe filmmaker with 2 of the principals, gives more insight and enjoyment into the music,the music process, and other things you will see for yourself when you watch it.",5,"Totally unique, outstanding musical experience!",1182556800,"06 23, 2007",2007,3557,"['watched', 'incredible', 'dvd', 'several', 'times', 'recent', 'months', 'including', 'one', 'theextras', 'great', 'radio', 'interview', 'filmmaker', 'principal', 'first', 'andsecond', 'violinists', 'Philadelphia', 'Orchestra', '5', 'stars', ""n't"", 'high', 'enough', 'rating', 'thisis', 'more', 'must', 'see', 'classical', 'music', 'lovers.In', 'experience', 'totally', 'unique', 'production', 'Interesting', 'entertaining', 'intimate', 'thought-provoking', 'interviews', 'professional', 'orchestral', 'musicians', 'are', 'main', 'focus', 'interweaved', 'many', 'scenes', 'musicians', 'live', 'performances', 'rehearsals', 'orchestraor', 'smaller', 'groups', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'venues', 'playing', 'chamber', 'music', 'also', 'non-classicalmusic', ""'ll"", 'pass', 'bluegrass', 'scene', 'trombonist', 'playing', 'Latin', 'music', 'wasgreat', 'fine', 'musicians', 'discuss', 'craft', 'music', 'many', 'points', 'view', 'Theinterviews', 'are', 'done', 'sometimes', 'only', 'one', 'musician', 'other', 'times', 'groups', 'courseeither', 'background', 'foreground', 'are', 'always', 'hearing', 'great', 'classical', 'music.I', 'felt', 'level', 'was', 'really', 'getting', 'know', 'musicians', 'themagic', 'music', 'depth', 'directness', 'honesty', 'comments', 'Thereare', 'so', 'many', 'inspiring', 'insightful', 'comments', 'so', 'much', 'music', 'packed', '90-minuteproduction', 'interesting', 'travel', 'footage', 'orchestra', 'Europe', 'Asia.A', 'few', 'comments/scenes', 'noted', 'ca', ""n't"", 'define', 'great', 'musicianship', 'know', 'when', 'hear', 'b', 'might', 'think', 'musicians', 'are', 'competitive', 'are', 'sometimes', 'yet', 'onthe', 'dvd', 'hear', 'otherwise', 'One', 'violinist', 'comments', 'how', 'blown', 'away', 'was', 'when', 'heardSarah', 'Chang', 'play', 'Paganini', 'concerto', 'when', 'was', 'nine', 'musician', 'express', 'notenvy', 'are', 'rather', 'deeply', 'inspired', 'phenomenal', 'talent.c', 'amazing', 'story', 'concertmaster', 'David', 'Kim', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'asoloist', 'still', 'fulfilled', 'expectations', 'deceased', 'Mother', 'music', 'forthis', 'entire', 'scene', 'Schubert', 'Cello', 'Quintet', 'Kim', 'pure', 'ecstasy', 'feelthe', 'same', 'feeling', 'own', 'way', 'beauty', 'music', 'playing', 'members', 'orchestra', '.d', 'One', 'percussionists', 'statement', 'end', 'dvd', 'something', 'Divine.e', 'musician', 'who', 'also', 'artist', 'comments', 'timelessness', 'ofthe', 'music', 'playing', 'listening', 'time-traveling', 'sheknows', 'composers', 'way.Words', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'convey', 'depth', 'experience', 'watching', 'dvd', 'Ido', ""n't"", 'think', 'person', 'can', 'appreciate', 'like', 'classical', 'music', 'One', 'other', 'excellentproduction', 'feature', 'very', 'visually-appealing', 'spatial', 'arrangements', 'musiciansduring', 'rehearsals', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'normal', 'look', 'orchestra', 'stage.This', 'better', '5-star', 'production', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'thetitle', 'pieces', 'were', 'displayed', 'would', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'hearing', 'thoughsome', 'pieces', 'are', 'recognizable', 'names', 'pieces', 'are', 'listed', 'endof', 'main', 'feature', 'think', 'omitted', 'several', 'Debussey', 'piece', 'thatwas', 'so', 'well', 'presented', 'insightful', 'explanation', 'connecting', 'sounds', 'andimpressions.As', 'mentioned', 'beginning', 'review', 'one', 'extras', 'radio', 'interview', 'ofthe', 'filmmaker', '2', 'principals', 'more', 'insight', 'enjoyment', 'music', 'music', 'process', 'other', 'things', 'will', 'see', 'when', 'watch']",Music From the Inside Out

Pierce ""owenparryfan""","[12, 13]","I come away from this film realizing to what extent the musician is in the work of art that is being created on the spot, with each performance. Music is a miracle, and live performance of great music really is sublime. And it's all done by people who, like me, enjoy being an audience. Watching these musicians enjoy the superb performance of Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons"" by the accordionist is a high point in this for me. Seeing the DePue brothers play bluegrass, watching the trombonist play with the salsa band, enjoying the violinist with the children at their school, made viewing this film special and important.
