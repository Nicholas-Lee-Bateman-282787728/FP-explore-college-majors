1387124,AAZRWLML88IZK,B00466HN86,A kids review,"[49, 160]","Independent Christian dramas have been the subject of some ridicule, primarily because they're often low budget affairs that wear their messages on their sleeves and feature sometimes questionable acting. Courageous manages at least to exhibit competent filmmaking, even if, as with previous films of its kind, it caters a little too heavily to a very specific demographic to be openly enjoyable for all. Set against the backdrop of the drug trade in Georgia, Courageous follows four deputies -- all fathers -- who are urged by their sheriff to spend more time with their families. When tragedy befalls one of the deputies, all four of them make a formal pact to change their lives and honor God in all that they do. My primary complaint had nothing to do with the message of the film itself; rather, I found Courageous to be a bit melodramatic and heavy-handed, choosing to gloss over complex issues with broad platitudes. If you're a believer, you may find yourself nodding in approval at the film, but don't expect Courageous to do much more than spoonfeed you what you already know it's going to say.",1,Courageous,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,1104,"['Independent', 'Christian', 'dramas', 'have', 'been', 'subject', 'ridicule', 'primarily', ""'re"", 'often', 'low', 'budget', 'affairs', 'wear', 'messages', 'sleeves', 'feature', 'sometimes', 'questionable', 'acting', 'Courageous', 'manages', 'least', 'exhibit', 'competent', 'filmmaking', 'even', 'previous', 'films', 'kind', 'little', 'too', 'heavily', 'very', 'specific', 'demographic', 'be', 'openly', 'enjoyable', 'Set', 'backdrop', 'drug', 'trade', 'Georgia', 'Courageous', 'four', 'deputies', 'fathers', 'who', 'are', 'urged', 'sheriff', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'families', 'When', 'tragedy', 'one', 'deputies', 'four', 'make', 'formal', 'pact', 'change', 'lives', 'honor', 'God', 'do', 'My', 'primary', 'complaint', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'message', 'film', 'rather', 'found', 'Courageous', 'be', 'bit', 'melodramatic', 'heavy-handed', 'choosing', 'gloss', 'over', 'complex', 'issues', 'broad', 'platitudes', ""'re"", 'believer', 'may', 'find', 'nodding', 'approval', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Courageous', 'do', 'much', 'more', 'spoonfeed', 'what', 'already', 'know', 'going', 'say']",Courageous

My daughter told me about it, and our Church had it in the library for viewing also.  After awhile, I decided to watch it on cable.  I commend the writing for showing how important it is for father's to realize how important their roles are in their families lives.  Also, showing how a house divided will not stand.  For also showing the importance of father's taking responsibility as leaders in their homes.  For them to also be examples for their children and wives.One lesson I got out of the writing, was to not take anything for granted in life.  Your love ones may be here one day, and gone the next.  No matter how small, enjoy your children while they are here today.  Take time out for them at every chance one can.  Don't let daily struggles, problems, or anything draw one away from their families.  Tell your family that you love them, and talk to each other as a loving family should.  Those special moments are priceless, and never can be gotten back.Though it took a tragedy to change these father's lives forever, the outcome was beyond anyone's dreams.  I felt proud that these father's realized that they could not do it alone without God.  Their faith and trust was put through the test at times, but their persistence to obey Christ's word prevailed.It should make one re-evaluate their lives, and always put Christ first.

You would not expect a story about several Christian policemen's lives to be as complex as it is. From a message on the need for fathers to be more actively involved in shaping their children, the movie delves into messages of honesty and reaching out to the community. It is the most intense of their 4 movies so far. (My favorite is Fireproof.) The way this one packs so many themes into a story, at such a deep level, shows the Holy Spirit was behind the project. The themes are the basis for the story, rather than an afterthought!

1387178,A3P876I6K3KL8V,B00466HN86,C. Long,"[0, 0]","First of all, let's get this out of the way: Yes, it's true, this is a movie produced by Christians with Christian messages and ideals in the movie. With that said, no matter how you look at it, this is a positive movie with good messages - and is one unique movie. To my knowledge, there just are no other movies out there like it with the main message it works so hard to portray. There is no comparison because there literally is nothing to compare it to (as far as I know anyway).If you are not a Christian, I do definitely think you can still enjoy and get value from this movie, but it is true that you might be less likely to enjoy it then the Christian audience would - but this would largely depend on whether you would be deeply offended at hearing some Christian doctrine and teaching in a movie. Many non-Christians are (as evidenced by some of the 1 star reviews here). But some are more ""tolerant"" of such views. It would depend where you are on the spectrum.At the end of the day, the core of this movie promotes fathers taking responsibility for themselves and their families and living honorably. I mean, that is pretty much the clear takeaway of the movie. To those that are not Christians that want to knock this movie for its clear Christian content and influences, I would ask them what part of this message is so horrible? Would they be more comfortable with a movie that shows and teaches fathers to be deadbeats (as plenty of other movies out there do?) Sadly the answer to that might be ""yes"". Some people will knock this movie for ""preaching"" (which it does!) but fail to realize that EVERY movie they have ever seen has preached SOMETHING to them - some more subtly perhaps, but there's always messages transmitted. And the vast majority of those movies haven't preached a message to them nearly as positive as this one! (unless you consider teaching you to curse - including cursing God - as much as you can, lust as much as you want, and generally behave as indecently as you can, ""positive"". I don't.)Now, to Christians I would say: This is a movie that EVERY Christian adult should see, especially fathers (though the themes are relevant for mothers as well). Created by the same church ministry that produced ""Fireproof"" (another excellent, unique movie that every Christian that is married or thinks they want to be someday should watch!) and ""Facing the Giants"" (also worthwhile but see my amazon review on it for more info), this one takes it to a whole new level.I echo a Focus On The Family reviewer when they said: ""Courageous isn't so much a movie for the whole family as it is a movie for the benefit of the whole family. Discernment should be used in deciding how young is too young to watch drug dealers shooting at and fighting with policemen."" The movie is PG-13, and probably appropriately rated. Although I know many have watched this movie with their children, I really am not sure it is that wise of an idea to actually watch it with your children, not just because of some of the violence (which isn't that bad all things considered), but because of the themes in the movie. The themes are great for adults to view and consider, but I don't see much benefit - and actually I can envision potential harm - for children (just my opinion).This movie is uniquely put together and very well-paced: you will cry and you will laugh, but it is paced in such a way that it doesn't overwhelm you (i.e. after an intense dramatic scene, you get some light-heartedness). The acting is pretty good (no, it's not ""perfect"") but it's perfectly fine and very believable - the emotional scenes in the movie I would think would be tough scenes to ""get right"" and it looks to me like they hit them perfectly!  No, the ""movie quality"" does not look like the latest Hollywood blockbuster (though it's not terribly far, either). But it also certainly doesn't look like a movie that was made with only a million dollars (which was its budget). Given the amount of movies out there with 200 or 300 million dollar budgets that are trash (I'm being kind) with all sorts of negative messages, this movie shows you don't need a lot of money to produce a really good, positive movie with life-changing impact!My one ""concern"" (but it is just nitpicking): I admit when I watched this the first time in the theater that the music placement seemed more about trying to ""show off"" Christian music in the movie than actually contributing to the story (unlike Fireproof).  However, since watching it again, I realize that wasn't justified.  For instance, I didn't realize on my first watch that the song the father danced to was the same one the girl danced to earlier in the movie.  And when they had that song playing (with him putting in the CD) right after a music montage with another contemporary Christian song, it just ""hit me wrong"".  In retrospect, now I can say that it really is an ""important part of the movie"" - but if I were doling out any advice for the future I might suggest they avoid 2 music songs literally back-to-back like that as it could give the wrong impression.  Indeed, I have seen reviews where non-Christians jumped on this, as well as the seeming promotion of other Christian products (including movie spin-off products).  One could easily argue that it was done to help deepen the impact/ministry impact of the movie, and I would probably even agree, but I'm just saying it seemed a bit obvious in a way that I'm not sure is all that helpful in the long run (but maybe it is, I don't know).Blu-ray quality: Great. I own the Blu-ray and DVD. Compared to the DVD, the Blu-ray is noticeably sharper and clearer (as it should be) and colors were bright and natural (as they should be). It also was great to see several of the extras in HD as well.  I would recommend everyone watch this movie in Blu-ray - it is worth it!  By the way, I also recommend that everyone that likes this movie watch it with the commentary track turned on at least once - you will learn some interesting things and see how some scenes relate that you might not have caught.Other thoughts: I seriously wondered if, after the success of ""Fireproof"", the producers might be tempted - as many ministries are that start in the Spirit but then experience great success - to end up producing the next item more in the ""flesh"". I think I can hands-down say that this did NOT happen with ""Courageous"".Beyond the obvious fruit of these movies that have come out of the Kendrick brothers and Sherwood Baptist Church, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the backstory. I love the fact that the whole Sherwood Pictures thing came about as a desire to really reach people for God (i.e. the motivations seem to have been/be right!) and out of a willingness to think outside the box (i.e. not just trying to ""copy"" what others are doing!). It wasn't started to make money. It was/is a ministry! There's a MAJOR difference in that. And I believe God has clearly blessed and honored that. Here you've got a 3,000-member church in Georgia that has managed to majorly influence millions of people because they dared to believe they could with God's help (and with the right motives). Author Randy Alcorn, who wrote the novelization for ""Courageous"", said this:""...the Sherwood story is distinctly different, in that it happened completely outside the mainstream. It wasn't birthed by a producer or a publisher, the way movies and books, whether secular or Christian, typically are. It began with the vision of a few church leaders who solicited the help of their local church, learning and improvising as they went. There's a great deal of creativity in local churches, lots of great songwriting and musical performances and even some quality drama. But it's often limited to songs sung by the choir, skits that illustrate sermon points, or localized Christmas and Easter pageants. People may come to these events from thirty miles away, but almost never do they break out of a community and achieve a regional status, much less a national or international one. Sherwood Pictures is in many ways unparalleled, a Cinderella story of staggering proportions. How could a church in Albany, Georgia have produced four films, counting Courageous, that have already had an amazing national and international impact, selling millions of DVDs and spinoff books? How could they have done so with mostly volunteer labor, at a fraction of the cost of conventional movie-making? Each movie has been better than its predecessor, and ten times better than what could be expected for the budget. But Courageous raises the bar to a whole new level. When many people see Courageous, they won't be thinking, 'Not bad, for a church' or 'Not bad considering it wasn't done by Hollywood.' A lot of people will just be thinking, 'Wow, this is a really good movie.'""I would concur. And I believe that God is still looking for men and women that will, in honest sincerity, with right motivations, seek God's heart on how He might want to use them to impact our world.I believe there's just as much a lesson for the Church in the backstory of Sherwood Pictures as in the actual movies they have produced. In fact, many of the themes that these movies portray kind of seem to mirror and are proved out by the reality of the backstory. For instance, it takes a lot of COURAGE and integrity to do what they have done - they've certainly had to be ""Courageous"" themselves. In ""Facing the Giants"", the main message was that when you follow Christ, nothing is impossible - that there is nothing impossible with God - and with faith in God (and living an ""excellent"" life - i.e. the ""works"" part of the ""faith without works is dead"" thing) and desiring for God to get the glory, that God is able to do beyond what we could even imagine. They've certainly proven that out!I for one get really excited when I see good Christian movies (or Christian-themed movies such as the Narnia series) because that is one area that non-Christians have had a monopoly on for far too long. It's refreshing to see what the medium can really accomplish when it is God-ordained and used for/to promote good, rather than demonically-ordained and used for/to promote evil.Chris LongLaugh & Lift

Having grown up in a family that had been split by divorce when I was 2 years old I have no remembrance of my parents ever living together. Living first with my mother and her parents and later with my mother and a step-father who resented my very existence I have no memory of a close relationship with a father figure. It would be difficult for me to evaluate what was missing from my life but it did leave a hole which is hard for me to define.The story is about five men, who are fathers in five distinctly different circumstances; four work as deputy sheriffs in Albany, Georgia and one is a carpenter/handyman. The ambience of the movie is very realistic and the viewer immediately feels thrust into the lives of these men as they deal with the challenges their lives present. The movie provides an opportunity to get to know the men and their families and develop a concern for them, their safety, and the personal problems with which they must deal.While there are some really cleverly funny moments, there are also moments of deep emotion which brought tears to my eyes. This is a movie that can touch deeply into the heart of the family in a realistic way and explore areas of fear and hope shared by most families. Three of the five men are supported by a strong Christian faith and demonstrate the sufficiency of their faith when sorely tested by circumstances. The other two are on roads to discovery with different outcomes for each of them.One of the strengths of this movie is the complete naturalness of each of the actors; it feels as if you're watching life in real time and somehow observing the lives of these individuals as they live them. This movie is a treasure for anyone who appreciates the value of the family and the faith centered life. It shows the rewards of faith and the penalties of bad decisions on both the individual and their families. This is one movie that every Christian family should have in their collection.

And we are inviting any man whose heart is willing and courageous to join us in this resolution. God's Word shows us that God desires for every father to courageous step up and do whatever it takes to be involved in the lives of his children.

""Courageous"" is wonderful film that I hope that many people, especially fathers...will watch and for some some, feel inspired to want to be there for their families and children!For those who are not familiar with Affirm Films, their films are spiritual and Christian-based films that are released under Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.And sometimes, Christian films are often viewed as too preachy or the lack of quality of major theatrical non-Christian films.  But I have to admit that within the past few years, films coming out from Affirm Films have been pretty good and with the release of ""Courageous"", not only did I find this film to be inspiring and uplifting, but I found it to be a fantastic film overall.But most importantly, although it does have a preaching message, it's a message that I feel is quite relevant... Fathers, no matter how busy you are...be there for your children.  Be there for your family.  No matter how busy your job is, no matter if you come home late...find a way!The film was produced by Sherwood Pictures (the company behind ""Flywheel"", ""Facing the Giants"" and ""Fireproof"") and ""Courageous"" is their fourth film and is directed by Alex Kendrick, who co-wrote the story along with his brother Stephen Kendrick.  The film was produced with a budget for $2 million and grossed $9 million on its opening weekend.""Courageous"" is a film that focuses on the lives of five men but the storyline centers on the character of Adam Mitchell.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Courageous"" is presented in 2:35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen and presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish and Thai Dolby Surround.  If you want the best video and audio quality for this film, it's important to note that this film is available on Blu-ray.  But for the most part, the film looks very good on DVD, considering a lot of the shots are outdoors for this film.  Audio quality is very good, especially towards the end where there is a good amount of action and a heavy exchange of gunfire that utilizes the surround channels.  But for the most part, this film is dialogue driven through the center and front channels.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Chinese, Korean and Thai.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Courageous"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by Alex and Stephen Kendrick.Deleted Scenes - (11:45) A total of 12 deleted scenes.Outrageous: Outtakes and Bloopers - (7:17) The outtakes from ""Courageous"".Courageous in 60 Seconds - A quick run-through of ""Courageous"" in 60 seconds.The Making of Courageous - (23:20) Filming in Albany, Georgia and behind-the-scenes in the making of ""Courageous"".  Alex and Stephen Kendrick talks about how God has influenced them to make this film.  The Kendrick's talk about the message to family's about the importance of having a father figure.  And also the many volunteers who have come together in wanting to get God's message out through this film.The Heart of Courageous - (3:18) The producers and filmmakers talk about how having a father is important in a children's life.The Story of My Father - (8:51) Susan Sanders and Ray Woo) who took part in various roles for Sherwood Pictures talk about their role in film.  Susan talks about her father was not too attached to the family when she was younger and how belief in God changed their lives and brought daughter and father closer together.JUDGMENT CALL:There have been many Christian films that have inspired me but ""Courageous"" was a film that probably had the most affect on me while watching it.As a father and unfortunately a workaholic, like many other father's similar to me who have a hard time of finding an end to work and spending time with the family, it hasn't been easy.  And to see this story that focuses on a man's duty to their family, and their duty to be there for them... I often wondered if many other men/fathers was also affected by the message of this film.As mentioned, Affirm Films, especially a film coming from Sherwood Pictures, these are Christian films and not every reviewer and not everyone who watches (especially those unaware that ""Courageous"" is a Christian film) will like the fact that this film does feature people who are spiritual, people who believe in God and yes, the message is preachy, not for religion but for fathers to be with their families and the importance of a child's development of having that father figure.The Kendrick brothers really know how to bring God's message out to a larger audience using them to communicate to their viewers.  And there was this feeling of an impact that I really can't describe but deep down in my heart, this film made perfect sense.  It made feel that in times of constant divorces, children separated from a parent...no one really talks about the children and how they are affected by it.I personally have seen family affected by divorce and especially the difficulties that children have faced when their father had left them.  Granted, none of the people I know have committed a crime but it affected their life and watched them fight frustrations during their younger years and then later as a parent because of it.  Granted, I do know of divorced fathers who make an effort to be with their children every weekend or everyday, even if its to talk to them, see them, have dinner or just a quick hello...they want to be in their children's life.So, the families depicted in this film, it's great to see how these friends evolved after their moment in crisis and to see those who were able to meet their resolution and unfortunately to see those who weren't able to.  The Mitchell families grief after the death of their daughter is rather emotional and the Kendrick brothers did a good job on focusing on their darker times but also their ability to move on and do something about their grief.  For Adam Mitchell, he may have lost a daughter but he still has a wife and son and he has to do all he can to provide for them but also be their for them.  And also to see how his friends were inspired by his dedication to his resolution.The character of Javier is an example of the average American suffering through the bad economy and trying to find work and take care of his family.  He knows that his family are in tough times and sure, his belief in God has made him positive and not a man in despair.  Most movies tend to showcase one's spiraling down until they crash hard during tough times but fortunately for this film, it doesn't happen that way.  Javier gets a job accidentally but its by people who are God believing people and are dedicated to their family.  They know he is a kind man,  a good man and let him become part of their circle but also extend their kindness in helping find a job.While the character of David represents the man who got a woman pregnant and has never seen their child.  Sure, the message is quite preaching towards fathers to take a responsibility and while some viewers may not like it, I for one am happy that the film does.  Not just for David but for all fathers...take responsibility for your family, be there for your children.  Some way, some how.""Courageous"" is a film that any father can watch, feel proud if they have been able to be there for their family but for many others, the message is powerful enough to make them think, inspire and hopefully change their lives for the better.Overall, ""Courageous"" was an eye-opener and it's message really got through to me loud and clear.Inspiring, uplifting and a story with a message that is powerful and full of hope!  ""Courageous"" is wonderful film that I hope that many people, especially fathers...will watch and for some some, feel inspired to want to be there for their families and children!Definitely

More importantly, others to hold them accountable and to enrich these values in their children, and other children who may have lost a parent or doesn't have a guardian at all. Thank you! I even encouraged my father to watch it and make such a vow unto God.

""Mainstream"" Hollywood seems almost afraid to touch these subjects. If a blockbuster movie has people who identify themselves as Christians, you can almost bet at some point they'll become the villains or be portrayed as hypocrites. And here comes ""Courageous"" from the same guys that gave us ""Facing the Giants"" and ""Fireproof"", movies that want to buck that trend and show a positive side of Christianity.Many of the people who have written 1 star reviews are clearly not interested in anything that promotes Christian values. The idea of a movie openly discussing Christianity and what God tells us is our role as a father in teaching our values and religion to our children is somehow a terrible thing.And the reviews claiming that this film is somehow negative in its portrayal of women, that's just laughable. Perhaps the movie could have been more complex and had something more for women, but then both would have been diluted and not as effective.I've seen this twice now. First in theaters, now on the DVD that I bought. I'm happy to support a film that sponsors the very best in Christian values: love, redemption, faith, forgiveness.Is it perfect? No. Is it Oscar-worthy acting? No. Although it's not nearly as bad as others seem to claim. Is it necessarily going to convert someone to Christianity, or to pay more attention to their faith and their responsibilities as a father or mother?

While I thought Fireproof was a well made movie, I disagreed with most of the ""morals"" preached in the movie - okay, that sounds weird, but I am not going to type out all my thoughts on that subject right here and now, so that will have to do.I chose to watch Courageous for two reasons:A. I read the book and found it quite good.B. I received a free copy to review (that is also why I chose to read the book.)This movie is about a group of cops who start off being ""good enough"" fathers, but later decide they want to do better.Who it is for:While this movie was made specifically for dads, I think it can be entertaining and uplifting to others as well.I didn't find the content too violent or mature, so I think that this movie should be appropriate for anyone over the age of 10 - when watched with a parent or other adult who would be willing to answer any questions they may have.Quality of the movie:I found that the quality of this movie and the acting were quite good. I especially thought the acting of the gang members was quite realistic.What I liked:This movie shares the gospel message, along with other ""biblical"" messages in a quality film - while some would still call this ""preachy"", I think it will have a greater influence than lower quality Christian films.The story was interesting and easy to follow.This movie doesn't have anything big that I disagree with, like Fireproof did...What I didn't like:...However, I didn't agree with everything completely (but when do I ever agree with everything on a movie completely?)My Conclusion:This was actually a pretty good movie, for which I am happy.I give Courageous 4 out of 5 stars.I received this a screener copy of this dvd from Provident Films, free to review.

It portrays how loss can change you for the good or for the bad.  It also shows the deep need our society needs for fathers who are involved in their children's lives.  It is a movie that shows that for our every action there are consequences that don't go away.  A father who is a cop, who misses much of their children's lives due to his job, comes to realize that there is more to being a dad then just providing when he looses his little girl to a car accident.  From this loss we see how the family changes, how the family sees all they could have done better... but they don't remain stuck in this hopeless sorrow and depression, the father has what I call an awakening.  He writes down several Resolutions causing his friends on the police force to join him on this commitment to be better fathers.  From this we see how it affects their jobs and community.  We see how they are faced with choices that tempt them to compromise.

So that they can see and learn how to protect and serve at home first.. They can see how to guide their families. They can see how to lead their family in prayer and bible study times. I love what the resolution says about men and their wives!I love Sherwood movies, I love the way they use their congregation also on the set and in the movies.I love how this movie comes together and the church as a whole comes together. I love how they show you how this church stands together in prayers together.

The movie has excellent plots that come together to show the differences in how people choose to live the lives. No foul language was necessary! This movie touched so many different emotions, and brings out the need for the values that our country has lost so much of, and I believe that is why our country suffers the way it does today. There's so much dishonesty! There are those who think that having a relationship with God isn't necessary, an excuse for a crutch, etc. That's because they have never experienced the profound affect that a relationship with Christ can bring to their lives, and the rewarding life changes that occur. This is NOT a preachy movie yet it shows the differences in the lives of those who have a lack of values to live by, and those who have chosen to incorporate Godly love, ethics, and virtues in their lives.

And fatherhood principles based on the Bible.That aside, I was surprised at how well done this movie is. The acting is  great - not a false note to be found (unlike the multi-million dollar Watchmen, for example, where many lines were flubbed). The story is compelling, nowhere as pollyannish as you might expect. It deals with issues families and our society are confronted with: daughters wanting to date, need for fatherhood, taking responsibility, failure, faith and disappointment, suffering, unanswered and answered prayer, the effects of hypocrisy, gangs, family tragedy, being tested, making hard choices.There is a subtle commentary on the misogynistic nature of abortion, but it is so quick you may miss it. Abortion has made it so easy for a man to say ""take care of it"", yet feminists think it gives them power. It's sad.The action is well shot. And there are some very, very funny moments, especially the scenes involving the dreaded Snake King. That character is a real hoot!(There will be angst about the Christian core of the movie. It's only because our society is so Christianized already that we don't realize how different our ideas of the ideal family would be if our culture hadn't been radically transformed by Christ's ideals. For example, the Roman paterfamilias is not the pattern you want your fathers to be following. Christianity reformed the old, oppressive traditions where girls were married off at twelve to much older men, for example, and imposed the standard of fidelity upon men as well, raising the dignity of women and making marriage something more elevated.

Found it great.Sheriff Deputies know the necessity of partnership. They take it to heart by forming a small group of men, adding one ethnic carpenter outsider, and strive to make a difference in the lives of their families. They base their ""Resolutions"" vows upon the Bible. Unfortunately it takes some tragic circumstances to get the men to this point. Their courageous open faith position will not always be taken well...as Dep. Adam Mitchell (Alex Kendrick-Dir, Writer, Editor, Actor) states, ""some will mock, some will have no resolve, others will say `I WILL'. Men of courage with God's help."" He notes they will (and do) face conflict, challenge, controversy, & need courage. Each man has his own family issues, each an individual path of struggle.A debate is sure to develop. Which is best, ""Courageous"" or ""Fireproof"" (2008); the last 2 films by the Kendrick brothers. I vote, equal. Alex does it all in this 4th Faith-based film adventure, while Stephen writes and produces. They also did ""Flywheel"" 2003; and ""Facing the Giants"" 2006. Is this film a moral and faith statement from the writers? YES! Of course! That's what they and their church intend. Expect it, and perhaps be blessed.This film begins immediately with ACTION, life-threatening, a crashing peak, and then an emotional end to the scene. Hold on to your hat, because you have almost 2 hours of emotion, action, and even some comedy ahead after that. Ken Bevel, as Hayes (Yes, from Fireproof) is new to this police squad. No big HOLLYWOOD stars in this low-budget film that relies on none of the typical theater gimmicks.

1387264,A1CTO6QJL5H909,B00466HN86,Hotaru-San,"[8, 9]","A young adult's review:To be honest, before I watched this movie I expected it to be like rest of the Sherwood movies. The messages in the other movies (Flywheel, Facing the Giants, Fireproof) were positive and good to think about- especially Fireproof. But, as we all know, all of their movies lacked in video editing, camera shots, ACTING and smooth moving scenes and plot.When I watched Courageous, I was pleasantly suprised to see that the video editing and camera shots had become much better with a few minor flaws here and there. The scene sequence and plot was a thousand times better; I only have two or three objections to their decision making in that area. Finally, the ACTING was a bajillion (yes, I used that word) times greater than any of their other movies. I would only kick out two and a half actors that they chose instead of the whole cast, or nearly the whole cast.The thing I liked best about Courageous was the ending scene. Being in the film and television field myself, I've seen a lot of endings but that one, I liked. It was creative and a little edgy (in a good way). The only thing I would have changed on the ending is the guys seen standing up. I wouldn't have chosen men who were wearing suits, or at least leave one or two in a suit and the rest in nice casual clothing. But that is my two cents.Overall, my review is this: I watched the movie twice. Of my own accord. I may watch it a third time some day but just to say that I watched it all the way through and then watched it again says something. I'm extremely picky about ALL movies (Christian and non-Christian) and I can still nitpick this one. But, it is indeed their best movie by FAR and it is good enough to have been in the theaters.",4,Unexpected?..,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,1730,"['young', 'adult', 'review', 'be', 'honest', 'watched', 'movie', 'expected', 'be', 'rest', 'Sherwood', 'movies', 'messages', 'other', 'movies', 'Flywheel', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'Fireproof', 'were', 'positive', 'good', 'think', 'about-', 'especially', 'Fireproof', 'know', 'movies', 'lacked', 'video', 'editing', 'camera', 'shots', 'ACTING', 'smooth', 'moving', 'scenes', 'plot.When', 'watched', 'Courageous', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'suprised', 'see', 'video', 'editing', 'camera', 'shots', 'had', 'become', 'much', 'better', 'few', 'minor', 'flaws', 'here', 'there', 'scene', 'sequence', 'plot', 'was', 'thousand', 'times', 'better', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'three', 'objections', 'decision', 'making', 'area', 'Finally', 'ACTING', 'was', 'bajillion', 'yes', 'used', 'word', 'greater', 'other', 'movies', 'would', 'only', 'kick', 'out', 'two', 'half', 'actors', 'chose', 'instead', 'whole', 'cast', 'nearly', 'whole', 'cast.The', 'thing', 'liked', 'best', 'Courageous', 'was', 'ending', 'scene', 'Being', 'film', 'television', 'field', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'endings', 'one', 'liked', 'was', 'creative', 'little', 'edgy', 'good', 'way', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'ending', 'guys', 'seen', 'standing', 'up', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'chosen', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'wearing', 'suits', 'least', 'leave', 'one', 'two', 'suit', 'rest', 'nice', 'casual', 'clothing', 'two', 'cents.Overall', 'review', 'watched', 'movie', 'twice', 'own', 'accord', 'may', 'watch', 'third', 'time', 'day', 'just', 'say', 'watched', 'way', 'then', 'watched', 'again', 'something', ""'m"", 'extremely', 'picky', 'movies', 'Christian', 'non-Christian', 'can', 'still', 'nitpick', 'one', 'indeed', 'best', 'movie', 'FAR', 'good', 'enough', 'have', 'been', 'theaters']",Courageous

While this does not have a counterpart to Kirk Cameron's star power, I feel the quality of the acting across the board is stronger.Like the other movies, this blends comedy and drama, and as Fireproof had some edge of the seat scenes, including the opening sequence. This is more of a drama than an action/adventure film, but that doesn't mean action is lacking.One decision I'd question is the emphasis on the Javier role. On the plus side, he adds a lot to the movie -- he helps make the movie. On the down side, his inclusion focuses the movie on the theme of male responsibility and takes the focus off the setting of police officers.The cover gives you the impression this is an ensemble movie, and to some point it is. But the focus is on Adam Mitchell, played by director Alex Kendrick (who also had the starring role in Flywheel and Facing the Giants).A final technical point. The construction of the story, especially at the end, can give it an appearance of being preachy. This film, as with the others by Sherwood Baptist, are theme dominated, with a message to communicate. The others have a better job in the ending of not being as preachy, with pictures instead of words being the final point.Yes, this movie has a very strong Christian worldview.

While I understand these complaints I have to disagree with the juvenile attacks against the story and acting in this movie. The story is just as good if not better than any secular movie I've seen come out of Hollywood in recent years. The performances in this movie are absolutely remarkable given the fact that the actors are not professionals. I saw no cheesy performances, no hams. Just because we don't see George Clooney or Matt Damon or Ryan Reynolds or whoever in this movie does NOT mean that the actors here are inadequate or poor. I can't help but think that the anti-Christian nature of many of the negative reviews gives away a bias that criticizes the story as cheesy and the actors as bad, not because this is true, but because these people just don't like Christians or Christianity. If the Christian message was removed from this movie and it featured an ensemble of well known Hollywood types, I'm sure the reviews from the Christianity-bashers would have been much different. Or if the movie had an anti-Christian message (as many movies out of Hollywood do nowadays) I'm sure these people would applaud it.Having said this, I highly recommend this excellent movie. The message of this movie is inspiring, life-affirming and heartwarming WITHOUT being cliched or cheesy. But if you hate Christianity and can't handle the Christian message being presented in a realistic and positive way and would just be insulted and put out by it, don't watch it because the Gospel of Jesus Christ is foolishness and an offense to those of you who are perishing and already dead in your sins.",5,"Beautiful, Well-Acted, Heart-Warming, Tragic, Funny, A Great, Great Movie",1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,1878,"['ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'virtually', '1', 'star', 'reviews', 'read', 'here', 'Amazon', 'movie', 'are', 'non-Christian', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'hostile', 'Christianity', 'resent', 'fact', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'not', 'call', 'out', 'fact', 'movie', 'Christian', 'message', 'understand', 'complaints', 'have', 'disagree', 'juvenile', 'attacks', 'story', 'acting', 'movie', 'story', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'secular', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'recent', 'years', 'performances', 'movie', 'are', 'absolutely', 'remarkable', 'given', 'fact', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'professionals', 'saw', 'cheesy', 'performances', 'hams', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'whoever', 'movie', 'NOT', 'mean', 'actors', 'here', 'are', 'inadequate', 'poor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'anti-Christian', 'nature', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'away', 'bias', 'story', 'cheesy', 'actors', 'bad', 'not', 'true', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Christians', 'Christianity', 'Christian', 'message', 'was', 'removed', 'movie', 'featured', 'ensemble', 'well', 'known', 'Hollywood', 'types', ""'m"", 'sure', 'reviews', 'Christianity-bashers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'different', 'movie', 'had', 'anti-Christian', 'message', 'many', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'do', 'nowadays', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'would', 'applaud', 'it.Having', 'said', 'highly', 'recommend', 'excellent', 'movie', 'message', 'movie', 'inspiring', 'life-affirming', 'heartwarming', 'WITHOUT', 'being', 'cliched', 'cheesy', 'hate', 'Christianity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'Christian', 'message', 'being', 'presented', 'realistic', 'positive', 'way', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'insulted', 'put', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Gospel', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'foolishness', 'offense', 'who', 'are', 'perishing', 'already', 'dead', 'sins']",Courageous

I knew it was going to be a religious movie, and being an atheist, I knew what I was in for.  My wife is a Christian and our friends are all Christian, that being said, the movie is really well done to a point.  It's clean cut, realistic, and there are some downright touching, funny and dramatic moments.  My one problem with this was the overlying, and overly acted, religious portion of the movie.  Growing up in a Christian household, having a Christian wife, and Christian friends who know my personal view on religion, I have never had any conversations with anyone like the overtly religious conversations these characters have, the preachy dialogue is a bit much, not only is it a put off to what could have actually been a much greater movie, but the actors seem to feel it too, almost forcing the unrealistic dialogue, it is like watching an uncomfortable play where the players a all wrong for the parts.  Don't get me wrong, I expected a Christian message within the movie, and have no problem with one being there, it just seems a little over done, I half expected to see the cops knock on a drug dealers house and ask if they have a personal relationship with Christ before making an arrest.  Don't get me wrong, the rest of the acting and dialogue within the movie is entirely believable, there is great potential for these movie makers, but, unless they are doing a movie about a preacher, they should leave the preaching in the pulpit and tell the story without the insanely Christian overtones.  To further make my point, the movie's target audience is Christian, so they are preaching to the choir.

For whatever ""because,"" for whatever reason, I find ""Courageous"" one of the most perfect films ever created. Every character rings true, every piece of dialogue, every scene, every setting, every part and parcel of action and plot ring true. ""Courageous"" is an awesome and amazing film filled with great emotional, moral, ethical moments buttressed by clips of exciting action scenes. It's a film worthy of viewing multiple times.""Courageous"" depicts the daily lives of four police officers and their Latino friend, Javier. The main character is played by the co-writer/director/producer, Adam Kendrick, whose finger is on the very mainline pulse of the America that once existed--a moral America. The film promotes many positive things, foremost being a good father, a father as set forth in the Bible. In fact, the ultimate premise for this promotion lies in statistics: Families without fathers tend toward serious delinquency problems. There's a void in the child's heart that needs to be filled, if not with a good father image, then with gang leaders. Even fathers who are a part of the family direct their children away from them if they are present but unavailable.The event that precipitates this resolution to be a true father is the death of the main character's precious daughter. Be prepared to be deeply moved by this well-written section. Some scripts try to jerk the viewer emotionally, but not this one. Everything is so evenly played and handled. No maudlin moments, no flaunting of emotional excess.Each of the male characters was (carefully, not blatantly) created to represent a specific type of man/father. Adam's character is the founder and spokesperson for the group that resolves to be biblically-based fathers. Nathan is the fine, upstanding black officer, proud of his accomplishments but who came out of a fatherless home and severely felt the loss. One character is the single man (young, white) who has fathered a child and not taken responsibility for her. The last is the one who yields to temptation and breaks the bond that hold the men together. The fifth is a Latino, a devout Catholic, a family man who is having terrible problems with keeping a job, not through his own fault.

If you hate movies with messages or a moral, you aren't going to love this one, no matter how great the message, or the movie is.Films that are lower budget often look it. And films with a Christian theme are often cheesy. The Kendricks do a good job trying to avoid both of these pitfalls. The film contains a trace of each, but the storyline, the characters and the message help to make those details fall into the background.The message within the film is a convicting and clear call to be a man, a father, as God designed. I grew to care about the characters. The moments of intense emotion were broken with humor and feel good glimpses. Pacing was good with the movie clipping along and avoiding drag.

1387318,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B00466HN86,K. Ostrowski,"[2, 5]","Courageous is a film about four deputies, working to bring the hammer down on a drug ring, while simultaneously struggling with their family issues, and their incomplete commitment to God and those they care about.Of course, this comes from the same group who brought us ""Fireproof,"" so we know two things about it from the get-go.  One good news, and one bad.  The good news is that the movie is beautiful and has a very strong story about its characters.  The bad news?  It's overtly a protestant movie.I'm not going to hide this; there are three scenes with a ""pastor,"" who doesn't wear a collar, and one in a ""church"" that just lets anybody get up and speak to the ""congregation;"" a church that looks, for the most part, like an auditorium.When a film is strongly and overtly protestant, as this one is, I always have a tough time getting past that.  As much as we might want to be virtuous and good, and to face our responsibilities with courage and boldness, without the rock of God's inerrant will to ground ourselves to, we'll never completely succeed.  Only one church has that, and everything else is man-made.Like the other films made by this group, this film is very real about its characters, and very grounded in reality.  It's very strong in its integrity, but it doesn't stroke the imagination, so I'm afraid that there's only so much enjoyment I could get out of it.  I'd much prefer to watch a substantive piece that also has some supernatural or imaginative dimension to it, because I feel it holds the attention much more strongly.  However, I understand and respect those who want to see a movie taking place in a world identical to their own; those who think it's easier to relate.  As a man, I don't think like that.Now, with all that dealt with, I really liked this film, in spite of its somewhat mundane premise and under-the-top delivery.  It had a good heart and a strong message with a lot of characters (perhaps too many, but perhaps not,) who all get the chance to show who they are.  The main character seems to be Adam; one of the deputies, who suffers a horrible tragedy and must gradually cope with it.  His integrity shines through the strongest, and he and his team go through a lot of soul searching (as well as a brief adventure or two,) on their route to a lifelong commitment that they have to make; to live with integrity and courage.Adam's partner Shane struggles with his own issues, and Nathan; another deputy, needs to face the fact that he's been focusing too much on being better than his father, and not enough on being the best father he can be.  The rookie, David, has an old shame to confront as well.Over the course of the film, Adam also makes the acquaintence of an out-of-work, but hardworking family man named Javier.  I would say that he has some of the strongest faith in the film, as well as being one of the most welcome additions to the cast.  He adds some much-needed comedy to the proceedings, but not by being foolish, or a stereotype, the way less-complicated movies probably would.  Javier adds many laughs to the movie, while facing his own difficult situations with honor and integrity, and I honestly found him one of the movie's most likable characters.This was a really good film.  It doesn't look like much, but it's got the right things in the right places.  Is it perfect?  No, but it's easily one of the best films released all year.  It's involving, substantive and severe.

In this movie, the grieving are given practical steps to maneuver through the grieving process and the critical decisions required to progress toward acceptance and healing. Sherwood is to be applauded for continuing to follow God's leading as they witness to the masses through their movies. The movie is not for the ""religious"" or the ""Christian"", it's for everyone.

For example, the character Javier Martinez was jobless in one scene, and fully employed in the next. What? Where did this job come from? Minor complaint: when Javier was called to the boss's office, the two other men looked like they had stepped out of a 60s movie (clothes and hairstyles) though this movie is set in modern-day. That was jarring and distracting.The cop stealing evidence was out of left field.

Next came Kirk Cameron and the firefighters and now we have police officers.Like a television sitcom from the 90s, the main theme of this movie is handed to you in a very obvious way early on - this story is about being a good dad. The focus is on four officers who must deal with how to be good dads. Many of the plot lines are telegraphed early. There won't be the twists in many of today's films but this movie is actually quite solid.The acting is great. (Coming from Sherwood Pictures this is amazing!) The humor had me laughing out loud multiple times. (I loved the Snake King in the back of the police car!) I really liked how they dealt with the father and his teenage daughter. It was your typical, ""she likes a not-so-good boy"" and with her dad not agreeing with the relationship until trust is earned, I was expecting a brooding, hostile teen. But the father/daughter scene in the restaurant was exactly how it should go.Unlike Facing the Giants in which everyone got what they wanted in the end, this movie has some real-life consequences. Not everyone gets what they want.I was impressed about everything in this film. It just proves that you can make a fantastic movie without having to resort to graphic nudity or language. While God, church, and Jesus are mentioned and they do come up in conversations, the religious aspect didn't feel shoved in my throat. It may have been that I knew what it was coming into the movie so it didn't catch me off guard.This is simply a 4-star movie with great lessons for dads in our society. A guilt trip?

It also has some very good humor in it.Some of the negative reviews here are simply unbelievable.  One person wrote that Courageous has nothing to do with fatherhood.  Say what?  Two of the main characters in the film are men who learn to be better fathers, and a good chunk of the movie is about how they learn to do that.  Someone else implied that only practicing Christians can or will enjoy this movie.  Such a comment says more about the mindset behind the review than it does about the movie.As one reads the negative reviews, one gets the sense that they come from a secular/anti-religious perspective and that they would bash the movie no matter what, no matter how good it happened to be.I've seen some B-quality-and-below Christian movies.

A VERY funny scene where Harvey is working on the garage when the guys are out for lunch and Shane reveals that his friend Harvey is in the hospital! Same name - different Harvey, another funny scene that goes into the saddest scene of the film. (which I won't give away)  After the mix up though, they become good friends and Harvey begins a full time job that Adam referred him for and the test given him is one given to many in real life, yet as the actors say, few can seem to pass it. You find yourself cheering Harvey's character on throughout the movie for his job searching, deep faith, and his portrayl of one the ""Street Kings."" (prepare for a laugh until you cry moment!) Personally,that's one of my favorite scenes! Many poignant family moments combined with police on the job action and a main storyline woven in as smoothly as silk with a message so powerful about fathers and family that your own life may be changed in that area. Many scenes in this movie softens hearts and for me anyway, gave me the desire to be the best woman/Christian/wife/mother I can possibly be. I've seen amazing changes in my husband, and that's seldom seen just from seeing a movie but - the message of being the BEST father and husband that leads his home by the Word of God Courageous is SO very powerful and makes you feel every emotion you possibly feel. Whether Christian or not, I HIGHLY recommend Courageous. My husband and I watch our copy at least twice a week, it's THAT good. Best news is, it has so many powerful scenes that while watching with several non-Christians, two gave their lives to Christ after seeing it with us! Whether a couple in their 50s with children and grandchildren like us, or a Church group - young or old, I just cannot recommend Couragous more! I PRAY that the Kendrick brothers actually read these reviews, as we would LOVE to see MANY MORE movies written/made by them. Lots of talent, both in storylines and in acting. Actors & actresses chosen completely fit the parts and this also is the same with their other films: their first, Flywheel, also Facing the Giants (watching as I type this!) and Fireproof. ALL wonderful in their own ways. We HAD to own them all! You'll NOT be sorry viewing and purchasing this gem, whether Christian or non. Thank you, Kendrick brothers, for wonderful family entertainment - Christian or non -Courageouswith a message that touches hearts and leaves us craving much more!  A MUST SEE! For us, 5 stars isn't enough, it's THAT good! Many fathers, especially Christian fathers, will have a difficult time remaining seated in the final scene, when Adam is speaking at church about dads and their being Godly and Courageous dads, husbands, and men during the call for such dads who are among those the most courageous for God and family.By the way -- ALL the actors are members of a Sherwood Church in Albany,Georgia. I think that's AMAZING! (I pray that the town is correct - I forget the denomination of the church, but all the actors are members of that church, also all their movies are made with ONE camera - this is info from one of the extras parts of the DVD - and to me that's far MORE than just another amazing blessing!)",5,Courageous changes hearts and leaves you wanting more!,1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,4118,"['Grab', 'box', 'tissues', 'snack', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'change', 'life', 'opinion', 'so', 'much', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'same', 'Courageous', 'story', 'four', 'policemen', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'time', 'four', 'brothers', 'Lord', 'Police', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'realistic', 'am', 'one', 'who', 'once', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'police', 'station', 'working', 'where', 'did', 'scenes', 'will', 'have', 'hanging', 'seat', 'are', 'happy', 'moments', 'very', 'sad', 'moments', 'thus', 'tissues', 'lots', 'drama', 'Policemen', 'uniform', 'home', 'families', 'way', ""'handy"", 'man', 'named', 'Harvee', 'becomes', 'adopted', 'group', 'character', 'Adam', 'Mitchell', 'played', 'Alex', 'Kendrick', 'one', 'movie', 'writers', 'put', 'being', 'hired', 'help', 'Adam', 'Kendrick', 'build', 'garage', 'praying', 'work', 'Adam', 'actually', 'waiting', 'handyman', 'referred', 'fellow', 'officer/best', 'friend', 'Shane', 'named', 'Harvey', 'VERY', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'Harvey', 'working', 'garage', 'when', 'guys', 'are', 'out', 'lunch', 'Shane', 'reveals', 'friend', 'Harvey', 'hospital', 'Same', 'name', 'different', 'Harvey', 'funny', 'scene', 'saddest', 'scene', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'mix', 'up', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'Harvey', 'full', 'time', 'job', 'Adam', 'referred', 'test', 'given', 'one', 'given', 'many', 'real', 'life', 'yet', 'actors', 'say', 'few', 'can', 'seem', 'pass', 'find', 'cheering', 'Harvey', 'character', 'movie', 'job', 'searching', 'deep', 'faith', 'portrayl', 'one', 'Street', 'Kings', 'prepare', 'laugh', 'cry', 'moment', 'Personally', 'one', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'Many', 'poignant', 'family', 'moments', 'combined', 'police', 'job', 'action', 'main', 'storyline', 'woven', 'as', 'smoothly', 'silk', 'message', 'so', 'powerful', 'fathers', 'family', 'own', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'changed', 'area', 'Many', 'scenes', 'movie', 'hearts', 'anyway', 'gave', 'desire', 'be', 'best', 'woman/Christian/wife/mother', 'can', 'possibly', 'be', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'amazing', 'changes', 'husband', 'seldom', 'seen', 'just', 'seeing', 'movie', 'message', 'being', 'BEST', 'father', 'husband', 'home', 'Word', 'God', 'Courageous', 'SO', 'very', 'powerful', 'feel', 'emotion', 'possibly', 'feel', 'Whether', 'Christian', 'not', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'Courageous', 'husband', 'watch', 'copy', 'least', 'twice', 'week', 'good', 'Best', 'news', 'so', 'many', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'watching', 'several', 'non-Christians', 'two', 'gave', 'lives', 'Christ', 'seeing', 'couple', '50s', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'Church', 'group', 'young', 'old', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'Couragous', 'more', 'PRAY', 'Kendrick', 'brothers', 'actually', 'read', 'reviews', 'would', 'LOVE', 'see', 'MANY', 'MORE', 'movies', 'written/made', 'Lots', 'talent', 'storylines', 'acting', 'Actors', 'actresses', 'chosen', 'completely', 'fit', 'parts', 'also', 'same', 'other', 'films', 'first', 'Flywheel', 'also', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'watching', 'type', 'Fireproof', 'wonderful', 'own', 'ways', 'HAD', 'own', ""'ll"", 'NOT', 'be', 'sorry', 'viewing', 'purchasing', 'gem', 'Christian', 'non', 'Thank', 'Kendrick', 'brothers', 'wonderful', 'family', 'entertainment', 'Christian', 'non', '-Courageouswith', 'message', 'hearts', 'craving', 'much', 'more', 'MUST', 'SEE', '5', 'stars', ""n't"", 'enough', 'good', 'Many', 'fathers', 'especially', 'Christian', 'fathers', 'will', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'remaining', 'seated', 'final', 'scene', 'when', 'Adam', 'speaking', 'church', 'dads', 'being', 'Godly', 'Courageous', 'dads', 'husbands', 'men', 'call', 'such', 'dads', 'who', 'are', 'most', 'courageous', 'God', 'family.By', 'way', 'actors', 'are', 'members', 'Sherwood', 'Church', 'Albany', 'Georgia', 'think', 'AMAZING', 'pray', 'town', 'correct', 'forget', 'denomination', 'church', 'actors', 'are', 'members', 'church', 'also', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'ONE', 'camera', 'info', 'one', 'extras', 'parts', 'DVD', 'far', 'MORE', 'just', 'amazing', 'blessing']",Courageous

There were also some genuinely funny moments, mostly between the lead cop and his partner.But then tragedy struck, and I was proven right; after that, it seemed like every other scene discussed God or faith or the Bible, and it was very blunt about delivering its message, which I rarely like in a movie, regardless of its genre.  It also included a scene about accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.I agree with the film's message; fathers need to step up and fulfill their responsibilities, I just believe that there are other ways besides the Bible and faith to guide you.  It almost seems like this film is saying it's the only and/or best way to do it.  So what about fathers from other faiths?  Or atheist fathers?  Does that mean they are incapable of being good fathers?  I disagree.It seems to me organized religion and its followers are always difficult topics to bring up in a film; either the followers are portrayed as close-minded fundamentalist zealots or just one step away from sainthood.

Courageous is a fantastic movie that touches the heart of all families. Yes, it's written with fathers in mind and how they can step up to the plate and be ""men of courage"" in leading their families, but it's also so much more.Courageous takes us into the lives of several families - normal families that we might encounter on any given day. In one family, we see a workaholic father who no longer seems to be able to find common ground with his teenage son. In another family, we see the struggles of a newly-divorced father. In yet another family, we see a dad who worries about the choices his teenage daughter might make when an older troubled boy seeks to date her. In still another family, we see a single dad who has never made any type of connection with his little daughter, not even in the form of helping to support her, financially or otherwise. In the final family, we see a dad who has just lost his job and wonders how he will support his wife and young children. These families could be like families we know and that is one of the many strong points of this movie - it's so identifiable.There are some sad parts in this movie, and yes, I cried (make that bawled!). Yet, there were also humorous parts. Most of all, there is a message in this film that reaches out to the lives of all parents. Life is short. Step up and be the parent God has called you to be. And for dads, the message is especially clear - lead your families as is outlined in Scripture. To do so makes all the difference, not only for the current generation, but for generations to come.If you only see one movie this year, I would highly recommend this one be the one. It's a wonderful movie for teens and above and one that will keep you thinking (and praying) about how you can be courageous.Reviewed by Penny Zeller, Author of ""77 ways Your Family Can Make a Difference.""",5,"If you see only one movie this year, this should be the one...",1322438400,"11 28, 2011",2011,1975,"['When', 'heard', 'Kendrick', 'brothers', 'had', 'film', 'works', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'latest', 'movie', 'Courageous', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'heart', 'families', 'Yes', 'written', 'fathers', 'mind', 'how', 'can', 'step', 'up', 'plate', 'be', 'men', 'courage', 'leading', 'families', 'also', 'so', 'much', 'more.Courageous', 'lives', 'several', 'families', 'normal', 'families', 'might', 'encounter', 'given', 'day', 'one', 'family', 'see', 'workaholic', 'father', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'teenage', 'son', 'family', 'see', 'struggles', 'newly-divorced', 'father', 'yet', 'family', 'see', 'dad', 'who', 'choices', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'might', 'make', 'when', 'older', 'troubled', 'boy', 'seeks', 'date', 'still', 'family', 'see', 'single', 'dad', 'who', 'never', 'made', 'type', 'connection', 'little', 'daughter', 'not', 'even', 'form', 'helping', 'support', 'financially', 'otherwise', 'final', 'family', 'see', 'dad', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'job', 'how', 'will', 'support', 'wife', 'young', 'children', 'families', 'could', 'be', 'families', 'know', 'one', 'many', 'strong', 'points', 'movie', 'so', 'identifiable.There', 'are', 'sad', 'parts', 'movie', 'yes', 'cried', 'make', 'bawled', 'were', 'also', 'humorous', 'parts', 'Most', 'message', 'film', 'out', 'lives', 'parents', 'Life', 'short', 'Step', 'up', 'be', 'parent', 'God', 'called', 'be', 'dads', 'message', 'especially', 'clear', 'lead', 'families', 'outlined', 'Scripture', 'do', 'so', 'difference', 'not', 'only', 'current', 'generation', 'generations', 'come.If', 'only', 'see', 'one', 'movie', 'year', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'be', 'one', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'teens', 'above', 'one', 'will', 'keep', 'thinking', 'praying', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'courageous.Reviewed', 'Penny', 'Zeller', 'Author', '77', 'ways', 'Family', 'Can', 'Make', 'Difference']",Courageous

The Point of Christian films should be toencourage people to live as Christ did. Not Judge others, accept people for who they are while not ignoring their sinful nature.Christian movies seldom give this message and it's made worse by drilling home personal opinions of the ministry behind these movies. Courageous is a fine example of this. The message of this film ""BE A MAN BY FORCING CHRIST ON TO YOUR KIDS"" This message is delivered through a melodramatic poorly edited sermon near the end of the film. It's less a Christian Sermon and looks more like when Hitler gave his speeches in Nazi Germany.Christians, some the mildness sheep with blind faith, Will love this others will see this as what it is.

But ..... will we still trust God when tragedy strikes instantly and permanently?  The greatest loss, I think is to lose someone we love, especially a child.

My wife seemed to enjoy this one and wept during parts of it, but my reaction was different - I found absurd certain aspects of the worldview expressed through this film. For instance, Robert Amaya plays Javier Martinez, an immigrant working man with sanitized ""legal"" working status (this is simplistic - in real life Christians, as well as non-Christians, more often find themselves grappling, in ethically tricky situations, with illegal immigrants). Now, desperate for work Javier is praying in an alleyway when Alex Kendrick (as Adam Mitchell) spots Javier in prayer (about what he knows not) and offers him work. Now yes, God does answer prayer, but not often on a time frame dictated by the constraints of film-making. Moreover, Javier gets work in a factory, and in a short time is promoted to manager owing to his integrity and work ethic. If the creators of this film understood what it is really like in a factory; who gets promoted in factories and why, they would not have insulted us with this simplistic depiction of the work-a-day world. The real world is much uglier, and how God works in the lives of his disciples in difficult circumstances is usually nuanced and complex. If in order to make films that audiences will pay money to watch, Sherwood Productions feels compelled to make simple the complex reality of life, and demystify the mysterious and often painful, protracted means by which Jesus brings his children victory over the world, than I doubt it's worth it. (In other words, if one can't portray in film the way God actually works in the live of people, than the Christian cause is not advanced by compromising the truth to satisfy the demands of film-making.)The producers of this film suffer from the uniquely black and white understanding of reality typical of conservative Baptists. At the same time, it is the simple faith of these Baptists that inspired them to begin film-making in the first instance; so, black and white simplistic thinking is a double edge sword.The redeeming virtue of this film is its central message, a message not entirely coherent until the end. That message is - that men in their role as fathers have a tremendous impact, for good or evil, on their children and yet men are largely unaware of their full impact, or potential for it. This central message is obscured by the unbridled preachy ambition of the Baptist filmmakers to squeeze in about a hundred other sub-messages that fill up and push this film way too long (over two-hours). For their next production Sherwood needs to simplify the plot, limit the number of truths they wish to teach, and exchange this film's complexity of incoherent noise for exploring the complexity of a victorious life through Christ.",2,Flat; predictable; reflecting a simplisitic view of God and His workings,1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,2811,"['wife', 'have', 'been', 'consumers', 'Sherwood', 'Pictures', 'productions', 'wife', 'seemed', 'enjoy', 'one', 'wept', 'parts', 'reaction', 'was', 'different', 'found', 'absurd', 'certain', 'aspects', 'worldview', 'expressed', 'film', 'instance', 'Robert', 'Amaya', 'Javier', 'Martinez', 'immigrant', 'working', 'man', 'sanitized', 'legal', 'working', 'status', 'simplistic', 'real', 'life', 'Christians', 'as', 'well', 'non-Christians', 'more', 'often', 'find', 'grappling', 'ethically', 'tricky', 'situations', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'Now', 'desperate', 'work', 'Javier', 'praying', 'alleyway', 'when', 'Alex', 'Kendrick', 'Adam', 'Mitchell', 'spots', 'Javier', 'prayer', 'what', 'not', 'work', 'Now', 'yes', 'God', 'answer', 'prayer', 'not', 'often', 'time', 'frame', 'dictated', 'constraints', 'film-making', 'Moreover', 'Javier', 'work', 'factory', 'short', 'time', 'promoted', 'manager', 'owing', 'integrity', 'work', 'ethic', 'creators', 'film', 'understood', 'what', 'really', 'like', 'factory', 'who', 'promoted', 'factories', 'why', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'insulted', 'simplistic', 'depiction', 'work-a-day', 'world', 'real', 'world', 'much', 'uglier', 'how', 'God', 'lives', 'disciples', 'difficult', 'circumstances', 'usually', 'nuanced', 'complex', 'order', 'make', 'films', 'audiences', 'will', 'pay', 'money', 'watch', 'Sherwood', 'Productions', 'feels', 'compelled', 'make', 'simple', 'complex', 'reality', 'life', 'demystify', 'mysterious', 'often', 'painful', 'protracted', 'means', 'Jesus', 'children', 'victory', 'world', 'doubt', 'other', 'words', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'portray', 'film', 'way', 'God', 'actually', 'live', 'people', 'Christian', 'cause', 'not', 'advanced', 'compromising', 'truth', 'satisfy', 'demands', 'film-making', 'producers', 'film', 'suffer', 'uniquely', 'black', 'white', 'understanding', 'reality', 'typical', 'conservative', 'Baptists', 'same', 'time', 'simple', 'faith', 'Baptists', 'inspired', 'begin', 'film-making', 'first', 'instance', 'so', 'black', 'white', 'simplistic', 'thinking', 'double', 'edge', 'sword.The', 'redeeming', 'virtue', 'film', 'central', 'message', 'message', 'not', 'entirely', 'coherent', 'end', 'message', 'men', 'role', 'fathers', 'have', 'tremendous', 'impact', 'good', 'evil', 'children', 'yet', 'men', 'are', 'largely', 'unaware', 'full', 'impact', 'potential', 'central', 'message', 'obscured', 'unbridled', 'preachy', 'ambition', 'Baptist', 'filmmakers', 'squeeze', 'hundred', 'other', 'sub-messages', 'fill', 'up', 'push', 'film', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'two-hours', 'next', 'production', 'Sherwood', 'simplify', 'plot', 'limit', 'number', 'truths', 'wish', 'teach', 'exchange', 'film', 'complexity', 'incoherent', 'noise', 'exploring', 'complexity', 'victorious', 'life', 'Christ']",Courageous

1387498,A2Q31IVRP9MYQX,B00466HN86,"William L. Isley, Jr.","[0, 0]","For Christmas our sons gave us the DVD of the first season of Desperate Housewives (or was it just for my wife?).  Last week my wife and I went to see the movie Courageous, and, although I was deeply moved by the film, I think that Desperate Housewives also has something important for Christians to consider.Courageous is the fourth movie by the Kendrick brothers, Alex and Stephen, and Sherwood Pictures.  It is the first that I have seen, and I highly recommend it.  The film is the story of four police officers who struggle to be men of integrity.  The actors are effective, and there is humor and action to keep a serious movie entertaining.  The heart of the movie, however, is a challenge to fathers to man up and take responsibility for their lives and in particular their families.  It explicitly proclaims the gospel.  Some might complain that it is preachy, but it is no more so than the 1947 Oscar-winning film A Gentleman&#8217;s Agreement that exposed anti-Semitism in America.  I believe that even a non-Christian father would be challenged to reexamine his priorities in life.On the other hand, Desperate Housewives is clever, often wickedly so.  It satirizes a traditional view of the woman&#8217;s role in American society. Wives are unanimously unhappy, and married mothers are either unfulfilled or become dehumanized robots.  In part, this is surely the cultural elite&#8217;s typical family and marriage bashing, but I think that it deserves a closer look.  The TV series does raise an issue that Courageous doesn&#8217;t deal with.  What should the role of wives and mothers be in contemporary America?Interestingly enough both Desperate Housewives and Courageous have two similarities.  First, they portray a kind of 1950&#8217;s suburban white collar family with a single male breadwinner and a stay-at-home wife.  It&#8217;s just that in Desperate Housewives the results are disastrous.  Now, I come from that kind of family and readily admit that it was wonderful for me to have a mom waiting for me when I returned home from school, a father who faithfully provided for us, and countless happy memories of meals and activities shared together as a family.  At the same time, it can be difficult for a mother who has dedicated herself completely to her children to find a purpose in life when they are grown up and gone away.The second similarity is that strangely enough neither Courageous nor Desperate Housewives is up to date.  In how many modern American homes are there a breadwinning father and a stay-at-home mom?  For good or ill, the modern economy and modern consumption almost demand two wage earners.What I&#8217;d like to see now is a Christian film that helps us to picture godly wives and mothers.  Courageous does not show us what the positive role of a Christian wife is.  The women seem just to wait around for their husbands to be the kind of men they are supposed to be.

We have watched tons of ""Christian"" movies from a Christian rental site.  Found the majority (99%)  of those movies to be very shallow, cheesy, slow to progress, and often choppy.  Some even had so many worldly attributes to them which, in our opinion, made them ineligible to be on a Christian rental site.  Nobody can watch this movie with an open heart & not be changed/effected.  Lives will be changed & have been changed already.  Sherwood does a wonderful job with balancing laughter & tears in their movies.  You will laugh & you will cry in these films.  They do an excellent job showing real-life, day-to-day Christianity...by presenting trials/challenges that most of us have or will face in our lives.

Especially now, this time of the year, when everybody (including 90% of the media) is fighting Christmas. Fortunately for the integrity of this country, people who came from Europe, don't want this country to become Europe. And they are fighting back! However, unfortunately, the silent Christian majority in this country does not vote (for a reason that I don't understand yet) but they are not going to let the secular progressives take over this great country.The movie is about a cop father that understands his responsibilities only after a huge personal tragedy. The contrast is made throughout the movie between the cop kids and the fatherless thugs. It is true that the father person is missing among most of the thugs, but that is not an excuse. It is not an excuse for people to beat up on a young seventeen high school kid as a hazing in order to be admitted in the gang.
