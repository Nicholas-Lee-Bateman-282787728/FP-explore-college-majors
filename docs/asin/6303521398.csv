378831,AE12AEJFCOGGY,6303521398,"David Montgomery ""Book Critic""","[6, 11]","[I actually give this movie a rating of **1/2.]The phenomenon of divorce is one of the most pervasive, and unfortunate, in contemporary American life.  It is a subject rife with pathos, laughter and tears.  As  such, it is a very fertile topic for a motion picture.  If the makers of  &quot;Bye Bye, Love&quot; don't mine the lode as deeply as they might have,  it is still a passably funny and generally enjoyable movie.The story  revolves around a trio of divorced dads: Dave (Matthew Modine), Vic (Randy  Quaid) and Donny (Paul Reiser). Between the three of them, they pretty much  run the gamut of divorced male experience.  Dave is a carefree playboy who  romances the mothers of his son's soccer teammates.  Vic is a bitter man  who loathes his ex and her new boyfriend.  Donny, the warmest of the three,  is still in love with his former wife.Together, these three friends try  to make some sense out of their mixed-up lives.  They meet their former  spouses each Friday afternoon for the new great American pastime: &quot;the  exchange of custody.&quot;  These scenes are as awkward as you would expect  them to be, often because the participants don't want them to be easy.  The  movie makes the obvious point that divorce is hardest on the kids.The  guys have an easy rapport, their conversations taking on the rhythms that  old friends have.  They talk about their kids and the new women in their  lives.  They also gripe about their exes and trade secrets for good  meatloaf.  (&quot;Look at me!  I used to trade baseball cards.  Now I trade  recipes.&quot;)  They make good characters because they are all so likable.  A nice change, though, is that their former wives are also portrayed  sympathetically.  Usually in movies like this one half of the couple is the  bad guy.  This film doesn't do that.Surely the hardest part of divorced  life is starting a new relationship.  All three of the men try, but none of  them are very good at it.  The night Dave has his new flame Kim (Maria  Pitillo) over to make friends with the kids is the same night two soccer  moms he's been sizing up unexpectedly drop by.  At the same time, Vic goes  on the blind date from hell with the uber-neurotic Lucille (Janeane  Garofalo).  While that's going on Donny drops in on Dave's ex-wife Susan  (Amy Brenneman) and finds that she may be just what he's looking  for.&quot;Bye Bye, Love&quot; was written and produced by Gary David  Goldberg (&quot;Family Ties&quot;) and Brad Hall (&quot;Saturday Night  Live&quot;)--two seasoned TV pros--and it has a definite television feel  about it.  In fact, as I was watching it I thought that it would make a  great pilot for a weekly sitcom.  The writing, lighting, directing and  acting would all seem more comfortable on the small screen.  (The cast  contains veterans of &quot;Mad About You,&quot; &quot;All in the  Family,&quot; &quot;NYPD Blue,&quot; and &quot;Chicago Hope,&quot; among  other shows.)That is not to say that this movie is terrible.  The line  between television and film is an increasingly blurred one today.  Some  people have argued--Barry Diller, former CEO of Fox for one--that  television programming has surpassed feature films in terms of quality and  subject matter.  While I do not agree, I am capable of appreciating and  enjoying good TV.  &quot;Bye Bye, Love&quot; falls into that category.",2,Better than TV?

378833,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6303521398,Gregor von Kallahann,"[2, 9]","This well-intentioned comedy starts off fine. You almost get the impression that it's going to make a SIGNIFICANT STATEMENT about love and marriage and divorce in modern day America.  All the complications of split up, ""blended,"" and re-blended families are all touched upon, and the script seems intelligently ambivalent and a tinge melancholy about it all.  The actors are, for the most part, up to the task of conveying that ambivalence. It seems almost like it's going to be one of those (increasing) rarities in American, a comedy for thinking adults.But by half-time, it's pretty much gone off track, and it's hard to pinpoint just where or why.  Some notes ring true right up to the end, while others ring increasingly false.  The relationship between Paul Reiser, his ex-wife and confused adolescent daughter is a case in point.  The complications one would expect between a basically amicable divorced couple, one of whom is apparently happily remarried, and one is still mooning over his lost love, seem to be authentically portrayed.  The tensions between father and maturing daughter aren't glossed over either.  But by the film's end, it's gotten, well, awfully hokey.  Yes, the mooning dad is forced to come to terms with the finality of his divorce.  Did he have to scale a tree to rescue is drunken and distraught 14 year old daughter (holing up in a treehouse on their old homestead no less) to reach that point.  The film's end has script doctoring and slightly-cynical-happy-ending written all over it.BYE BYE LOVE wants desperately to be a comedy for the 90s.  As I recall the critical reception and box office results at the time, it came up short back then.  Ten years later, it seems a even more forced--and dated to boot.  But it's well-acted, has a number of funny moments (Janeane Garofalo and Randy Quaid's blind date scenes are genuinely funny and up the laugh meter quotient  considerably...but even that highlight is undercut by some absurd follow-up action that has Quaid invading the radio broadcast of a reviled male Dr. Laura figure (Rob Reiner)--only to achieve instant media stardom himself.In the end, the SIGNIFICANT STATEMENT is overwhelmed by the silliness.

378838,A1U6B2LDK3BUVU,6303521398,"LF ""Keep your feedback to yourself, these are...","[0, 9]","The best scene in the movie is the Italian restaurant scene with Janeane Garofalo, using a wry Randy Quaid as her foil when she's not ignoring him.  It's the only scene that made me laugh.The scene with the playboy dad having three women in his home, and the one preceding it when his girlfriend's excessive dinner fails to impress the little kids, are both weak.  Playboy dad is not interesting, and that character really shouldn't have been one of the three musketeers of this movie.The other dad, Reiser, is uncomfortable to watch.  His dinner scene with his daughter is good in the sense that it shows how estranged a father can be with his teenage daughter, but that too is uncomfortable to watch.  The later scene, up in the treehouse when his daughter suddenly loves him, is completely unbelievable.  The fact is, that particular girl would not say those things to her dad.  She doesn't love him.  She doesn't need him at all.  She's done with him.The stupid bit about Randy Quaid being a talk show star after busting into Rob Reiner's talk show is just dumb.  That doesn't happen.  If you want to write a cartoon, get Warner Brothers to draw it for you.  Have the Road Runner in it, or Bugs Bunny.The film gives us comfort food at the end, with the trite and meaningless advice to love your kids.  The fact is that your kids need love from their father when they are young, but once they hit a certain age, in double digits, you are done.  Daddy just becomes the source of cash from then on.  Kids in their teens and twenties don't want or need anything but money from dad.  Fittingly, I saw this film on Father's Day.To sum the whole movie up, Janeane Garofalo is funny, Randy Quaid is kind of comfortable to watch although the script gets a little stupid at the tail end, and the other two male leads are just mildly annoying.  The script doesn't say anything worthwhile about the subject it took on.  But it takes a subject on, so at least that's something.

He tells his  friends he'll start dating again when it feels right (It's been three  years).  At the same time, he's having trouble communicating with his  fourteen -year-old daughter, Emma (Eliza Dushku), who, according to Donny,  is in ""That difficult age group:  twelve through thirty-five.""  Dave  (Matthew Modine) has a fairly amicable relationship with his ex, Susan (Amy  Brenneman), but still shies away from commitment, and has a string of  girlfriends.  At one point his son, Ben (Ross Malinger), asks if they could  wear name tags to make it easier on him.  Vic (Randy Quaid) has the hardest  time of all; he and his ex, Grace (Lindsay Crouse) are barely civil to one  another, which, of course, makes handling the situation with the kids all  the more difficult.  The film does a nice job of addressing the various  dilemmas faced by all involved, including the children, without ever  delving too deeply or getting so serious as to take the story in an  entirely different direction; from the Friday transfers of the kids from  mom to dad, to the attempts at weekend ""bonding"" with their children by the  fathers who desperately want to stay close, to the needs of all the adults  to find the love and relationships necessary to move on with their lives.  There's some memorable moments, as well, here; one is a thoughtful sequence  played against Mary Chapin Carpenter's wistful song ""Stones In The Road,""  and another is an especially hilarious scene in which Vic has a blind date  with a young divorcee named Lucille (Janeane Garofalo), which starts off  badly and goes downhill from there.  Their dinner together at an Italian  restaurant is priceless; pure classic comedy.  Another nice touch to the  overall story is using a young man, Max (Johnny Whitworth), who works at  McDonald's and is training Walter (Ed Flanders), a seventy-year-old working  on the ""adopt a geezer"" program, as a kind of before and after contrast to  where Donny, Vic and Dave are currently at in their own lives.  Max is just  entering the arena of romance; he has an eye for Vic's daughter, Meg (Amber  Benson), while Walter is a widower who lost his wife after forty-eight  years of marriage, and still pines for her.  Interjected throughout is  another nice bit, as radio talk-show-host-marriage-counselor Dr. David  Townsend (Rob Reiner) of station KGAB dispenses advice even as he prepares  for his own fifth wedding.  The supporting cast includes Maria Pitillo  (Kim), Dana Wheeler-Nicholson (Heidi) and Pamela Dillman (Sheila).  The  performances are good all around, most notably Reiser, who conveys his  angst and frustration particularly well, and Quaid, whose bitterness and  caustic sarcasm are almost tangible.  The real standout here, however, is  Garofalo, who takes hold of a lesser role and absolutely shines, creating a  singularly unforgettabe character in Lucille.  This may not be a  masterpiece, but it's a good movie, and one you're going to want to see  more than once (or even twice).  Anyone who has ever been married,  divorced, a parent, a kid or any of the above, will find something here  with which to identify.  ""Bye Bye, Love,"" is sometimes funny, sometimes  bittersweet and touching, and one you're going to remember and, I think,  appreciate.",3,A Poignant Look At Getting On With Life,959644800,"05 30, 2000",2000,3767,"['sometimes', 'humorous', 'more', 'often', 'poignant', 'look', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'divorce', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'covered', 'Bye', 'Bye', 'Love', 'directed', 'Sam', 'Weisman', 'Told', 'primarily', 'perspective', 'three', 'divorced', 'fathers', 'overview', 'what', 'increasingly', 'become', 'significant', 'segment', 'family', 'life', 'America', 'Donny', 'Paul', 'Reiser', ""n't"", 'yet', 'accepted', 'over', 'ex', 'Claire', 'Jayne', 'Brook', 'still', 'feels', 'too', 'much', 'friends', ""'ll"", 'start', 'dating', 'again', 'when', 'right', 'been', 'three', 'years', 'same', 'time', 'having', 'trouble', 'communicating', 'fourteen', '-year-old', 'daughter', 'Emma', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'who', 'according', 'Donny', 'difficult', 'age', 'group', 'twelve', 'thirty-five', 'Dave', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'fairly', 'amicable', 'relationship', 'ex', 'Susan', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', 'still', 'away', 'commitment', 'string', 'girlfriends', 'one', 'point', 'son', 'Ben', 'Ross', 'Malinger', 'could', 'wear', 'name', 'tags', 'make', 'easier', 'Vic', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'hardest', 'time', 'ex', 'Grace', 'Lindsay', 'Crouse', 'are', 'barely', 'civil', 'one', 'course', 'handling', 'situation', 'kids', 'more', 'difficult', 'film', 'nice', 'job', 'addressing', 'various', 'dilemmas', 'faced', 'involved', 'including', 'children', 'ever', 'delving', 'too', 'deeply', 'getting', 'so', 'serious', 'take', 'story', 'entirely', 'different', 'direction', 'Friday', 'transfers', 'kids', 'mom', 'dad', 'attempts', 'weekend', 'bonding', 'children', 'fathers', 'who', 'desperately', 'want', 'stay', 'close', 'needs', 'adults', 'find', 'love', 'relationships', 'necessary', 'move', 'lives', 'memorable', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'here', 'one', 'thoughtful', 'sequence', 'played', 'Mary', 'Chapin', 'Carpenter', 'wistful', 'song', 'Stones', 'Road', 'especially', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'Vic', 'blind', 'date', 'young', 'divorcee', 'named', 'Lucille', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'badly', 'downhill', 'there', 'dinner', 'together', 'Italian', 'restaurant', 'priceless', 'pure', 'classic', 'comedy', 'nice', 'touch', 'overall', 'story', 'using', 'young', 'man', 'Max', 'Johnny', 'Whitworth', 'who', 'McDonald', 'training', 'Walter', 'Ed', 'Flanders', 'seventy-year-old', 'working', 'adopt', 'geezer', 'program', 'kind', 'before', 'contrast', 'where', 'Donny', 'Vic', 'Dave', 'are', 'currently', 'own', 'lives', 'Max', 'just', 'entering', 'arena', 'romance', 'eye', 'Vic', 'daughter', 'Meg', 'Amber', 'Benson', 'Walter', 'widower', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'forty-eight', 'years', 'marriage', 'still', 'pines', 'Interjected', 'nice', 'bit', 'radio', 'talk-show-host-marriage-counselor', 'Dr.', 'David', 'Townsend', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'station', 'KGAB', 'advice', 'even', 'own', 'fifth', 'wedding', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Maria', 'Pitillo', 'Kim', 'Dana', 'Wheeler-Nicholson', 'Heidi', 'Pamela', 'Dillman', 'Sheila', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'around', 'most', 'notably', 'Reiser', 'who', 'conveys', 'angst', 'frustration', 'particularly', 'well', 'Quaid', 'bitterness', 'caustic', 'sarcasm', 'are', 'almost', 'tangible', 'real', 'standout', 'here', 'however', 'Garofalo', 'who', 'hold', 'lesser', 'role', 'absolutely', 'shines', 'creating', 'singularly', 'unforgettabe', 'character', 'Lucille', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'good', 'movie', 'one', ""'re"", 'going', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'once', 'even', 'twice', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'married', 'divorced', 'parent', 'kid', 'above', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'here', 'identify', 'Bye', 'Bye', 'Love', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'bittersweet', 'touching', 'one', ""'re"", 'going', 'remember', 'think', 'appreciate']",Bye Bye Love VHS
