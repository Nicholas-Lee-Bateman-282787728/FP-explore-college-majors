1396301,A1DB4U8ISVULVE,B004CRR9HE,Bill Smith,"[3, 40]","This DVD contains a show about the first TV Westerns, like Bonanza. I never thought that Bonanza was an accurate portrayal of the West. First of all, I don't like color television. Don't like that color for nothin'. Saw 'Bonanza' at my in-laws. It's not for me. The Ponderosa looked fake. Hardly recognized Little Joe.But more importantly, the portrayal of male-female relations was out of whack. Ya got these four guys living on the Ponderosa and ya never hear them say anything about wanting to get laid. I mean ya never hear Hoss say to Little Joe, ""I had such morning wood when I woke up this morning."" They don't talk about broads - nothing. Ya never hear Little Joe say, ""Hey, Hoss, I went to Virginia City and I saw a girl with the greatest ass I've ever seen in my life."" You never hear Little Joe say ""Hey Pa, I'm goin into town to get a piece of ass."" They just walk around the Ponderosa: ""Yes, Pa, where's Little Joe?"" Nothin' about broads. I don't think I'm being too picky. But, if at least once, they talked about getting horny. I don't care if you live on the Ponderosa or in Baltimore, guys talk about getting laid. Plus, you got Lorne Greene with 3 sons, all from different mothers, who are about 5 years younger than he is. What, each one died giving birth? I'm beginning to think that show doesn't have too much realism.(Mercer, you ever see DINER? or TIN MEN? Now that's realism.....that is a hint Ronnie)",3,I never thought Bonanza was very realistic,1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,1425,"['DVD', 'show', 'first', 'TV', 'Westerns', 'Bonanza', 'never', 'thought', 'Bonanza', 'was', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'West', 'First', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'color', 'television', 'Do', ""n't"", 'like', 'color', 'nothin', 'Saw', 'in-laws', 'not', 'Ponderosa', 'looked', 'fake', 'Hardly', 'recognized', 'Little', 'Joe.But', 'more', 'importantly', 'portrayal', 'male-female', 'relations', 'was', 'whack', 'Ya', 'got', 'four', 'guys', 'living', 'Ponderosa', 'ya', 'never', 'hear', 'say', 'anything', 'about', 'wanting', 'get', 'laid', 'mean', 'ya', 'never', 'hear', 'Hoss', 'say', 'Little', 'Joe', 'had', 'such', 'morning', 'wood', 'when', 'woke', 'up', 'morning', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'broads', 'nothing', 'never', 'hear', 'Little', 'Joe', 'say', 'Hey', 'Hoss', 'went', 'Virginia', 'City', 'saw', 'girl', 'greatest', 'ass', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'never', 'hear', 'Little', 'Joe', 'say', 'Hey', 'Pa', ""'m"", 'goin', 'town', 'get', 'piece', 'ass', 'just', 'walk', 'Ponderosa', 'Yes', 'Pa', 'where', 'Little', 'Joe', 'Nothin', 'broads', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'picky', 'least', 'once', 'talked', 'getting', 'horny', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'live', 'Ponderosa', 'Baltimore', 'guys', 'talk', 'getting', 'laid', 'got', 'Lorne', 'Greene', '3', 'sons', 'different', 'mothers', 'who', 'are', '5', 'years', 'younger', 'What', 'one', 'died', 'giving', 'birth', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'think', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'realism', 'Mercer', 'ever', 'see', 'DINER', 'TIN', 'MEN', 'Now', 'realism', 'hint', 'Ronnie']",Pioneers of Television: Season 2

I'd seen the Pioneers of Children's Television show when it originally aired and I thought it was a delightful discussion of local children's TV shows and the personalities, such as Willard Scott and Jim Henson, who had gone on to greater fame after cutting their teeth on local television.

So that was principal reason for purchase and it did an adequate job. Only an hour (approx.) long so a lot of favorite programs not covered but what they did, they did pretty well.
