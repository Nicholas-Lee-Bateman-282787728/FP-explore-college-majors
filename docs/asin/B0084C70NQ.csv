1545966,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0084C70NQ,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Anchored by two masterclass performances, `Rust + Bone' is certainly one of the best films of 2012.  I remember watching Audiard's 2009 Oscar nominee `A Prophet' and thinking that he had a brilliant career ahead of him, and seeing `Rust + Bone', which is arguably better, I think I made a good call there.  With such depth of breadth, Audiard floats us from one scene to the next in a beautifully calculated and effervescent look at human weakness and desperation, all the more enriched by the beauty and the triumph of the human spirit.  Equal parts gritty realism and heartfelt passions, `Rust + Bone' etches itself on our skin and creates a magnificent glimpse at the power of film today.It moved me deeply.The film follows the lives of two individuals who are confronted with adversity in one form or another and form a beautiful bond (that is fragmented and strained, but still beautiful) through the course of their newfound situation.  Alain, a former kick boxer is suddenly left in charge of his five year old son and moves in with his sister in order to give him a stable home.  He gets a few jobs here and there as a bouncer or a security guard (thanks to his girth) and then he meets the beautiful if not mysterious Stephanie, an Orca trainer at a sea life theme park who is in an unhappy relationship.  After a horrific accident leaves Stephanie paralyzed, she seeks out Alain for support.  His carefree approach to her plight (he doesn't coddle her or treat her different while still maintaining an air of kindness and respect for her) helps open Stephanie's eyes to the light at the end of her very dark tunnel.  But before happiness can be achieved, pain and suffering have to erode progression, and as Alain falls into street fighting to make some extra money and feed his hunger for excitement, his role as a father becomes secondary and his relationship with Stephanie becomes strained as his self-centered habits start to take over.With such rich direction, `Rust + Bone' is harmoniously crafted and packs a punch unlike any other film I've seen this year.  It make me shake.  I was shaking.  It truly unearthed such honesty and such raw humanity that I'm in awe of the film, from start to finish.  The film's bookends are fantastic, the development of character was some of the best (if not THE BEST) I've seen this year, and the way it tackled such melodramatic themes with authenticity as opposed to unbridled theatrics was a blessing.  Visually beautiful, emotionally textured and all around unforgettable; this is how you make movies people!",5,Grit and humanity at its purest...,1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,2565,"['Anchored', 'two', 'masterclass', 'performances', 'Rust', '+', 'Bone', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2012', 'remember', 'watching', 'Audiard', '2009', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Prophet', 'thinking', 'had', 'brilliant', 'career', 'ahead', 'seeing', 'Rust', '+', 'Bone', 'arguably', 'better', 'think', 'made', 'good', 'call', 'there', 'such', 'depth', 'breadth', 'Audiard', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'beautifully', 'calculated', 'effervescent', 'look', 'human', 'weakness', 'desperation', 'more', 'enriched', 'beauty', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'Equal', 'parts', 'gritty', 'realism', 'heartfelt', 'passions', 'Rust', '+', 'Bone', 'etches', 'skin', 'magnificent', 'glimpse', 'power', 'film', 'today.It', 'moved', 'deeply.The', 'film', 'lives', 'two', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'confronted', 'adversity', 'one', 'form', 'form', 'beautiful', 'bond', 'fragmented', 'strained', 'still', 'beautiful', 'course', 'newfound', 'situation', 'Alain', 'former', 'kick', 'boxer', 'suddenly', 'left', 'charge', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'moves', 'sister', 'order', 'give', 'stable', 'home', 'few', 'jobs', 'here', 'there', 'bouncer', 'security', 'guard', 'thanks', 'girth', 'then', 'beautiful', 'not', 'mysterious', 'Stephanie', 'Orca', 'trainer', 'sea', 'life', 'theme', 'park', 'who', 'unhappy', 'relationship', 'horrific', 'accident', 'Stephanie', 'paralyzed', 'out', 'Alain', 'support', 'carefree', 'approach', 'plight', ""n't"", 'coddle', 'treat', 'different', 'still', 'maintaining', 'air', 'kindness', 'respect', 'open', 'Stephanie', 'eyes', 'light', 'end', 'very', 'dark', 'tunnel', 'happiness', 'can', 'be', 'achieved', 'pain', 'suffering', 'have', 'erode', 'progression', 'Alain', 'street', 'fighting', 'make', 'extra', 'money', 'feed', 'hunger', 'excitement', 'role', 'father', 'secondary', 'relationship', 'Stephanie', 'becomes', 'strained', 'self-centered', 'habits', 'start', 'take', 'over.With', 'such', 'rich', 'direction', 'Rust', '+', 'Bone', 'harmoniously', 'crafted', 'punch', 'other', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'make', 'shake', 'was', 'shaking', 'truly', 'unearthed', 'such', 'honesty', 'such', 'raw', 'humanity', ""'m"", 'awe', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'film', 'bookends', 'are', 'fantastic', 'development', 'character', 'was', 'best', 'not', 'THE', 'BEST', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'way', 'tackled', 'such', 'melodramatic', 'themes', 'authenticity', 'opposed', 'unbridled', 'theatrics', 'was', 'blessing', 'Visually', 'beautiful', 'emotionally', 'textured', 'unforgettable', 'how', 'make', 'movies', 'people']",N/A
1545967,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0084C70NQ,Andy Orrock,"[29, 33]","I'm writing this review in defense of 'Rust and Bone' after seeing EW's Owen Gleiberman pick it as one of his ""Worst Movies of 2012.""  Granted, this latest offering from French director Jacques Audiard doesn't measure up toA Prophet (Un proph?te), but that's like taking Francis Ford Coppola to task for not matching the greatness of 'The Godfather' (no, that's not sacrilege: 'A Prophet' is that good).Gleiberman gripes that star Marion Cotillard is ""forced to flail and mood-swing from scene to scene [and] (i)n an insult to the disabled, there is never much to her but her hellacious injury.""I'm wondering what movie he saw.  What we saw was what we thought was a very realistic depiction of the trauma and long period of despair that someone involved in a catastrophic injury of this nature would endure.  Far from there being ""never much to her but her hellacious injury,"" Cotillard's character does, to the contrary, get light back in her life through the most unlikeliest of sources: Matthias Schoenaerts' brawling, ""operational"" (see the movie) Alain.  Witness her smile-filled reunion with her erstwhile workmates at their SeaWorld-like employer or her obvious delight at being thrust into a managerial role at Alain's unsanctioned backstreet brawls.Call this also a defense of Audiard, who I believe is the world's best director (and a personal favorite along with Israel's Eran Riklis and Eytan Fox).  Audiard has released four brilliant movies:Read My Lips(2001) - A brawling, magnetic Vincent Cassel and beguiling Emmanuelle Devos (note: it's a state law to use the word 'beguiling' with Ms. Devos)The Beat That My Heart Skipped(2005) - A brawling, magnetic Romain Duris raises holy h-ll as part of a crew doing ugly business for property owners while battling the other side of personality (the part that stifles a talent with classical piano). Niels Arestrup and his piercing eyes are brilliant as Duris' fatherA Prophet (see link above) (2009) - Indescribably good.  This andThe Lives of Othersand 1a and 1b (and, on other days, 1b and 1a) on my personal list.  The tension leading up to Malik and Reyeb's prison encounter might make you hyperventilate (when we saw it in the theater, two people in front of us couldn't take the pressure and fled).  Niels Arestrup shows up again here.  Again, he's brilliant.Audiard's films aren't about the gauzy, love-filled Paris streets of grandes &eacute;coles graduates.  They're about the gritty underbelly of France - the immigrants, the dispossessed, the laborers, the street-educated.  Every minute you spend watching his work rewards you with fascination and knowledge.",4,In defense of 'Rust and Bone',1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,2630,"[""'m"", 'writing', 'review', 'defense', ""'Rust"", 'Bone', 'seeing', 'EW', 'Owen', 'Gleiberman', 'pick', 'one', 'Worst', 'Movies', '2012', 'Granted', 'latest', 'offering', 'French', 'director', 'Jacques', 'Audiard', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'toA', 'Prophet', 'Un', 'proph', 'te', 'taking', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'task', 'not', 'matching', 'greatness', ""'The"", 'Godfather', 'no', 'not', 'sacrilege', 'Prophet', 'good', '.Gleiberman', 'star', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'forced', 'flail', 'mood-swing', 'scene', 'scene', '[', ']', 'i', 'insult', 'disabled', 'never', 'much', 'hellacious', 'injury', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'what', 'movie', 'saw', 'What', 'saw', 'was', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'trauma', 'long', 'period', 'despair', 'someone', 'involved', 'catastrophic', 'injury', 'nature', 'would', 'endure', 'Far', 'being', 'never', 'much', 'hellacious', 'injury', 'Cotillard', 'character', 'contrary', 'get', 'light', 'back', 'life', 'most', 'unlikeliest', 'sources', 'Matthias', 'Schoenaerts', 'brawling', 'operational', 'see', 'movie', 'Alain', 'Witness', 'smile-filled', 'reunion', 'erstwhile', 'workmates', 'SeaWorld-like', 'employer', 'obvious', 'delight', 'being', 'thrust', 'managerial', 'role', 'Alain', 'unsanctioned', 'backstreet', 'brawls.Call', 'also', 'defense', 'Audiard', 'who', 'believe', 'world', 'best', 'director', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Israel', 'Eran', 'Riklis', 'Eytan', 'Fox', 'Audiard', 'released', 'four', 'brilliant', 'movies', 'Read', 'Lips', '2001', 'brawling', 'magnetic', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'beguiling', 'Emmanuelle', 'Devos', 'note', 'state', 'law', 'use', 'word', ""'beguiling"", 'Ms.', 'Devos', 'Beat', 'My', 'Heart', 'Skipped', '2005', 'brawling', 'magnetic', 'Romain', 'Duris', 'holy', 'h-ll', 'part', 'crew', 'doing', 'ugly', 'business', 'property', 'owners', 'battling', 'other', 'side', 'personality', 'part', 'talent', 'classical', 'piano', 'Niels', 'Arestrup', 'piercing', 'eyes', 'are', 'brilliant', 'Duris', 'fatherA', 'Prophet', 'see', 'link', '2009', 'Indescribably', 'good', 'andThe', 'Lives', 'Othersand', '1a', '1b', 'other', 'days', '1b', '1a', 'personal', 'list', 'tension', 'leading', 'up', 'Malik', 'Reyeb', 'prison', 'encounter', 'might', 'make', 'hyperventilate', 'when', 'saw', 'theater', 'two', 'people', 'front', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'pressure', 'fled', 'Niels', 'Arestrup', 'up', 'again', 'here', 'Again', 'brilliant.Audiard', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'gauzy', 'love-filled', 'Paris', 'streets', 'grandes', 'eacute', 'coles', 'graduates', ""'re"", 'gritty', 'underbelly', 'France', 'immigrants', 'dispossessed', 'laborers', 'street-educated', 'minute', 'spend', 'watching', 'work', 'rewards', 'fascination', 'knowledge']",N/A

Ying,"[3, 8]","The trailer of this film seemed interesting.The beginning was good, a penniless former boxer father with a young son had to scrunge for food left over by fellowtrain travellers.  They arrived in a seaside city south of France and seeked refuge at his sister's home.The father got a job as a bouncer and met a woman who worked at a marine park as a whale trainer.The director of this film made ""A Prophet"", a gritty prison film a few years ago.To start with Marion Cotillard seemed to be too mature to be believable as a whale trainer in an amusement park.Secondly no details had been revealed on how her injuries were sustained therefore you just accept it as a dramatic curve.The jobless father took her under his wings until she recovered, both physically and mentally while you don't feel a hint of sentiment or love.Although the father had a damaged hand, he got involved in bare knuckled illegal fights to earn money.How could this be possible(the fighting sequences were poorly choreographed)with an injured right hand?Halfway through watching the film, I told myself there could be 3 outcomes for a film of this type:1.  A tragic ending.2.  A happy ending.3.  A nothing happens ending.You may select one of the endings from above.None really matters.The whole story simply defy believability therefore you don't feel anything for the couple's predicaments and mutual attraction.A failed and too self-important drama from France.",2,A Failed Drama due to a Poor Script,1369353600,"05 24, 2013",2013,1435,"['trailer', 'film', 'seemed', 'interesting.The', 'beginning', 'was', 'good', 'penniless', 'former', 'boxer', 'father', 'young', 'son', 'had', 'scrunge', 'food', 'left', 'over', 'fellowtrain', 'travellers', 'arrived', 'seaside', 'city', 'south', 'France', 'seeked', 'refuge', 'sister', 'home.The', 'father', 'got', 'job', 'bouncer', 'met', 'woman', 'who', 'worked', 'marine', 'park', 'whale', 'trainer.The', 'director', 'film', 'made', 'Prophet', 'gritty', 'prison', 'film', 'few', 'years', 'ago.To', 'start', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'seemed', 'be', 'too', 'mature', 'be', 'believable', 'whale', 'trainer', 'amusement', 'park.Secondly', 'details', 'had', 'been', 'revealed', 'how', 'injuries', 'were', 'sustained', 'therefore', 'just', 'accept', 'dramatic', 'curve.The', 'jobless', 'father', 'took', 'wings', 'recovered', 'physically', 'mentally', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'hint', 'sentiment', 'father', 'had', 'damaged', 'hand', 'got', 'involved', 'bare', 'knuckled', 'illegal', 'fights', 'earn', 'money.How', 'could', 'be', 'possible', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'were', 'poorly', 'choreographed', 'injured', 'right', 'hand', 'Halfway', 'watching', 'film', 'told', 'could', 'be', '3', 'outcomes', 'film', 'type:1', 'tragic', 'ending.2', 'happy', 'ending.3', 'nothing', 'ending.You', 'may', 'select', 'one', 'endings', 'above.None', 'really', 'matters.The', 'whole', 'story', 'simply', 'defy', 'believability', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anything', 'couple', 'predicaments', 'mutual', 'attraction.A', 'failed', 'too', 'self-important', 'drama', 'France']",N/A

Both are expertly shot, wonderfully acted and instant classics.Rust and Bone is a foreign film, so its also the best foreign film of 2012 and should have won more awards, though it was nominated. Quite simply, this film stunned me. It is truly beautiful.If I had to pick which one I love more, between Cloud Atlas and Rust and Bone, I might actually choose Rust and Bone.Being a fan of both Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts, I was blown away at their acting on display here. The film allows both actors to reach career-defining heights, especially Marion Cotillard who is already such a good actress. Their performances are breathtaking to behold, and it will be difficult for both of them to out-do their work here.The personal journeys that both characters embark on are equally touching and difficult to watch. Life takes these two people and literally shakes them up, drops them, then stands back to watch how they'll handle it or IF they can even recover.Then the film takes a beautiful turn as both shaken characters find recovery in each other. They're relationship transcends romance, becoming something even deeper.And when that relationship is tested, the end result is truly something to behold...proving ""romance movies"" can be realistic without giving into cliche. Although Rust and Bone is more than a ""romance movie"", and its sure as hell not a ""chick flick"".Each character has at least one scene in the film where they triumphantly fight back against life's hardships. It is in these moments that Rust and Bone shines brightest.Rust and Bone is true cinema. It is so well-done that I personally place the film in my Top 25 Films of All Time (high praise indeed). The film gets 5 out of 5 stars.The blu-ray has perfect video and audio. In terms of quality true to the source material, Video and Audio both receive 5 out of 5 stars.The extras are great too, with an Audio Commentary track and some lengthy Making-of videos, along with some Deleted Scenes. Extras get 4.5/5 stars.Overall: 5/5 stars. Rust and Bone, along with Cloud Atlas, is the best film of 2012, the best foreign film of 2012, and one of the greatest films of all time, truly. It has been graced with a perfect blu-ray release. See it. Own it!Rating: Rated R. There is some language, though its in French (the entire film is in French with English subtitles) and minor drinking in a club-like setting. Violence tends to be bloody in a few fight scenes, and sexual material is raw in some scenes and beautiful in others. The emotional intensity of the story can be gut-wrenching, so be prepared for it.

1545972,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0084C70NQ,C. Sawin,"[13, 17]","Topless shots of Marion Cotillard have been floating around the internet and have had people talking about ""Rust and Bone"" for months now. If you avoid the trailers, your mindset will be something along the lines of ""Oh, this is that movie where Marion Cotillard gets naked and loses her legs."" However, if you've seen ""Bullhead,"" then Matthias Schoenaerts should be a name you recognize and if you've seen ""A Prophet"" then Jacques Audiard is a name you should at least be intrigued with. There's been a lot of buzz and a positive reputation surrounding ""Rust and Bone"" and thankfully it's for a good reason.Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts) leaves Belgium with his son Sam (Armand Verdure) and moves in with his sister and her husband in Antibes, southern France. After getting a job as a bouncer, Ali meets a whale trainer named Stephanie (Marion Cotillard). They're mostly somewhat civil to each other at first, but after Stephanie has an incident at work where she loses her legs their relationship only seems to grow stronger. Meanwhile, Ali's selfishness begins to take a toll on everyone in his life that he cares about.Pay attention to the opening credits. You don't have to take notes or anything silly like that, but just have those images play through the back of your mind as your eyes and ears watch the events that unfold throughout the rest of the film. These credits are done in a way that originally seem very abstract and look to be just a series of images strung together for artistic integrity, but there's more to them than that. There's a reason you're seeing these images flash before your eyes.This is kind of a difficult film to watch, but not for the obvious reasons. Growing up without a father, the scenes where Ali improperly parents Sam, neglects him, or forgets to pick him up at school because he was too self involved hit harder than they probably should have. Witnessing Ali be so irresponsible is the most difficult part, but watching Stephanie put up with so much of it is also infuriating at times.There was a lot of talk about Matthias Schoenaerts outshining Marion Cotillard here and you can't really argue with that. Cotillard does a splendid job with her character. Stephanie is obviously very unhappy with her life and is on the verge of killing herself at times after the tragedy. Cotillard portrays depression and getting back on her feet (in a manner of speaking) extremely well. Imagining Schoenaerts outdo his performance in ""Bullhead"" was almost impossible, but he does so here in the final act. The moments of him with his son out on the ice and the entire hospital scene are just so haunting and powerful.You can usually guess what's going to happen before it does, but the way the camera positions itself it's as if it's preparing you for it as well. After Stephanie loses her legs, she refuses to go outside due to being ashamed, embarrassed, and afraid of what people might say. Take note of how bright the light sources are when Ali first starts visiting Stephanie again. There are some really dynamic angles utilized in the film as well like being propped on the handlebars of a scooter or attached to the side of an 18-wheeler as it drives through every type of weather imaginable.""Rust and Bone"" is a pretty outstanding film. Its one downside is that it isn't seamless and it sloppily jumps back and forth from heavily following Ali at first, then switching gears and revolving around Stephanie for awhile, and finally coming back around to Ali. The characters are apparently very true to the setting, but it's difficult to get behind them.

Eastwood,"[0, 0]","SPOILER ALERT: In A-to-Z terms, RUST AND BONE (2012) is a happy-ending love story that brings together Stephanie, a woman who works at a ""Sea World"" type place on the coast of southern France and has both her legs chewed off by an orca, and Ali, a boxer/security guard who helps her heal emotionally and brings her back to loving life.In my judgment, this film is very good in many scenes, some sweet, some amusing (especially those with Marion Cotillard, the 2007 Oscar winner who plays Stephanie, the injured woman), but this film unfortunately is very hokey and lame in many other scenes, including the last 25 minutes where a series of plot incidents is rather clumsily constructed to show Ali (played by Matthias Schoenaerts) leaving, disgraced and alienated from his family, going off to make his fortune anew, and heroically receiving terrible injuries himself while saving a life ... before being reunited with Stephanie.Technically speaking, the CGI scenes showing Stephanie's amputated legs and prosthetic legs are world-class. (BTW my late father had a prosthetic leg, so I know a bit about these things.)Weighing this movie's strengths and weaknesses, if I were giving it a letter grade, it would be a ""B-"".WARNING: This is NOT a film to watch with your kids (or parents/grandparents), as there's explicit sexual ""language"" and nudity (male & female both).",4,"A WELL-ACTED  MIXTURE OF POWERFUL SCENES, WEAK PLOTTING, AND NUDITY AND ""LANGUAGE"" THAT ARE NOT FOR EVERYONE",1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,1368,"['SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'A-to-Z', 'terms', 'RUST', 'AND', 'BONE', '2012', 'happy-ending', 'love', 'story', 'together', 'Stephanie', 'woman', 'who', 'Sea', 'World', 'type', 'place', 'coast', 'southern', 'France', 'legs', 'chewed', 'off', 'orca', 'Ali', 'boxer/security', 'guard', 'who', 'heal', 'emotionally', 'back', 'loving', 'life.In', 'judgment', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'many', 'scenes', 'sweet', 'amusing', 'especially', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', '2007', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'who', 'Stephanie', 'injured', 'woman', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'hokey', 'lame', 'many', 'other', 'scenes', 'including', 'last', '25', 'minutes', 'where', 'series', 'plot', 'incidents', 'rather', 'clumsily', 'constructed', 'show', 'Ali', 'played', 'Matthias', 'Schoenaerts', 'leaving', 'disgraced', 'alienated', 'family', 'going', 'off', 'make', 'fortune', 'anew', 'heroically', 'receiving', 'terrible', 'injuries', 'saving', 'life', 'being', 'reunited', 'Stephanie.Technically', 'speaking', 'CGI', 'scenes', 'showing', 'Stephanie', 'amputated', 'legs', 'prosthetic', 'legs', 'are', 'world-class', 'BTW', 'late', 'father', 'had', 'prosthetic', 'leg', 'know', 'bit', 'things', 'Weighing', 'movie', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'were', 'giving', 'letter', 'grade', 'would', 'be', 'B-', '.WARNING', 'NOT', 'film', 'watch', 'kids', 'parents/grandparents', 'explicit', 'sexual', 'language', 'nudity', 'male', 'female']",N/A
1545975,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0084C70NQ,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[6, 6]","From Jacques Audiard, the director of ""A Prophet: and ""Read My Lips"" comes the award winning French-Belgium film ""De rouuille et `dos"" (""Rust and Bone"").Receiving positive reviews worldwide, ""Rust and Bone"" would star Academy Award winning actress Marion Cotillard (""La vie en rose"", ""Inception"", ""The Dark Knight Rises"", ""Contagion"") and Matthias Schoenaerts (""Bullhead"", Black Book"", ""Loft"").VIDEO:""Rust and Bone"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  The film looks fantastic as the outdoor scenes are colorful and vibrant, close-ups are full of detail, skin tones look natural, black levels are nice and deep.  The film looks fantastic on Blu-ray and the visual effects and how they are able to make Marion Cotillard without any legs was fantastic.  I didn't notice any artifacts or aliasing, picture quality for the film is nicely saturated and looks fantastic on Blu-ray.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Rust and Bone"" is presented in French 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  The film is primarily a dialogue and music driven film but while the film is primarily center and front-channel driven, there are moments where ambiance is used for the surround channels.  Primarily crowd ambiance or Katy Perry's ""Fireworks"" being played, for a film such as ""Rust and Bone"", the lossless soundtrack is very good and appropriate.  I didn't notice any problems with the audio during my viewing of the film.Subtitles are in English, English SDH and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Rust and Bone"" come with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Commentary with Jacques Audiard and Thomas BidegainMaking of Rust and Bone - (59:57) A one hour documentary on the making of ""Rust and Bone"" directed by Byantonin Peretjatko.VFX Breakdown by Mikros - (2:25) A short before and after visual effects feature on the use of green screen technology and visual effects for ""Rust and Bone"".On the Red Carpet: Toronto Film Festival - (2:53) Interviews with the cast and crew on the red carpet of the Toronto International Film Festival.Deleted Scenes - (6:45) Six deleted scenes with optional commentaryTheatrical Trailer - (1:59) The original theatrical trailer for ""Rust and Bone"".JUDGMENT CALL:With each film that I have seen from director Jacques Audiard, what I love about the films is how fresh and different they are from Hollywood films.From his last film ""Un prophete"" which I found to be amazing, his latest film ""Rust and Bone"" was a pleasant surprise.From the trailer to the opening moments of the film, the first thing that was going in my mind was, ""oh great, another thug film with a beautiful woman falling for him"".  But also saying to myself that Audiard is not known for banality, he knows how to switch things up for the viewers and surprise them.So, while the film does start off with a guy who looked as if he came from trouble and has a child joining him, the film is about a man who wants to get his son away from the trouble that the child's mother was involved in.  Ali is unemployed but he doesn't want his son to be drug runner at the age of five, so, he moves with the kid to stay with his sister Anne.Anne is not in the best financial shape but she is at least caring for her brother and her nephew but also emphasizes to him that the boy is his responsibility.  We see how Ali tries to get a good job to help raise his child but he's not exactly a father figure.  He neglects his son as he puts job, his passion for kickboxing/fighting and having sex with women as more of a priority.Meanwhile, we are introduced to a beautiful woman named Stephanie who is a whale trainer at the marine aquarium.  But after being chomped on by one of her whales that mistakes her legs as food, she now must move forward with her life with her disability.  But like any person who had legs one day and their whole life altered after losing them, we see Stephanie going through the motions of depression, isolation and not wanting to hear pity stores from family and friends, the only person she doesn't know that she wants to talk to is Ali.  The guy she met once at the club.But Ali, turns out to be a cool guy by taking her out to the beach, to get out of her shell and try to enjoy life once again.  But most importantly, Ali is there to not pity her but treat her like a normal human being, even offering to have sex with her, to help her know if she still has desires and can still be a sexual woman.The two develop this friendship built upon their boody call but it's when Ali lets her into his world of fighting and seeing how she supports him and how she accepts his son Sam and also his living conditions with no criticism, he eventually begins to war up to her.But with dreams to be a fighter and a woman who wants more from their ""friendship"", is Ali ready to settle down?  And will he come through for the people he matters most, especially his son, Sam.Part of the film's efficacy is the magnificent performance by Marion Cotillard.  I don't think I have seen one bad performance from the actress and in ""Rust and Bone"", she is fantastic!  From playing a woman that is happy, depressed, sad, angry and just a full spectrum of emotions that are displayed on screen, Jacques Audiard hit casting gold with Cotillard and it's this performance that made this film much more enjoyable.The visual effects for the film was also fantastic and how they were able to capture Cotillard as a person without legs and make the film look so realistic was great.As for the Blu-ray release, ""Rust and Bone"" looks amazing on Blu-ray.  Colors are vibrant, especially the outdoor scenes. Closeups show plenty of detail and the visual effects were done to perfection and Cotillard looked as if she didn't have any legs.  Audio quality is primarily dialogue driven, with the Katy Perry ""Fireworks"" song and crowd ambiance used for the surround channels to be the most utilized segments of the film's lossless track.  But dialogue and music is crystal clear.Overall, ""Rust and Bone"" is yet another unique, fresh and wonderful Jacques Audiard film.

The plot is an interesting mix of qualities: compelling but unfocused, surprising but often dissatisfying. As patchy as it is, this story takes you to some interesting places. Several reviewers have noted that we don't know enough about the characters to really empathize with them. I see what they mean, but I think this lack of information is intentional, and I'm not so sure that it would be better if we did know more--not because they're such terrible people, but because, you know, does it really matter in the end? The mere fact that reviewers--even those who give it only 1 or 2 stars--have found so much to analyze here and have interpreted RUST and BONE in so many different ways says something for the substance of this film.Anyhoo, Ali and Stephanie are both quite real, and RUST and BONE is an interesting mass character study of people at their bests and worsts, who, though it's nothing dramatic, DO experience some change and transformation in discovering what's most important to them. Stepanie's injury and Ali's love coupled with abuse and neglect of his son are vital ingredients, done with sober conviction.Those with a low tolerance for raw violence and/or melancholy should probably skip RUST and BONE.

RUST AND BONE is based on a strange story by Craig Davidson  and Audiard along with Thomas Bidegain transformed this touching love tale into an unusually moving and beautiful film.Ali (the strikingly handsome and talented Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts) in his mid 20's, an unemployed father to a young son, Sam (Armand Verdure) travels on a metro gathering scraps of discarded food for sustenance and arrives in Antibes, southern France to look for work. The father son duo crash with Ali's sister Anna (Corinne Masiero) who already has her own share of problems with money and temporary employment. Ali gets a job as a bouncer in a night club but maintains his passion for kick boxing. One evening in the nightclub where he works, Ali meets St&eacute;phanie (Marion Cotillard) and escorts her safely to her home after she is injured in a brawl at the club. St&eacute;phanie works at a marine tourist park training Orca whale's where she suffers a tragic accident during a show and wakes up in the hospital to realize that her legs have been amputated. Ali meets a guy at work who informs him about a kick boxing game where he can make money and enjoy his sport. St&eacute;phanie, now in a wheelchair, is terminally depressed and gives Ali a call. Ali visits her and takes her to a beach where they swim. Over a period of time, Ali and St&eacute;phanie spend a lot of time together and get involved in casual sex `on call', while Ali hooks up with other women as well, being honest about it with St&eacute;phanie. St&eacute;phanie starts to accompany Ali to the kick boxing matches and a symbiosis forms between both of them. St&eacute;phanie regains self esteem in Ali's company and gets artificial limbs. She starts to walk again and even manages Ali's bets for kick boxing. Ali, St&eacute;phanie and some friends visit the same night club where Ali used to work. Ali goes to the dance floor and flirts with a girl as St&eacute;phanie watches curiously. Ali goes away with the girl leaving a dejected St&eacute;phanie with other friends. Anna is fired from her job as the higher management comes to know of her taking home the expired food products. Anna blames Ali for this as Ali was involved in an odd job where he installed spy cameras in work areas at the direction of the management to spy on the activities of their employees. This results in a standoff between Ali and Anna's partner and Ali leaves. Sam stays with Anna while Ali goes to a training facility for kick boxers in a distant place and loses touch with St&eacute;phanie. Sam visits Ali at his facility for a day and both are shown playing on a frozen lake. A weak spot on the frozen lake cracks and Sam falls into the lake, loses consciousness and floats on. Once Ali realizes Sam is missing and spots him under the frozen lake, Ali breaks his hands with his beating the ice to free the unconscious Sam. Sam survives and in the hospital Ali breaks down while talking to St&eacute;phanie on the phone and confesses his love for her after realizing that he had been cold and insensitive to her all this time. As the film closes, Ali is shown to have gone professional in kick-boxing as Sam and Stephanie stand by him in what looks like a post-fight victory ceremony.The film is enhanced by Alexandre Desplat's sensitive musical score and the cinematography, especially in the fight scenes, by St&eacute;phane Fontaine is exemplary. But it is the powerful performances by Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts that bring this impossibly fragile film to a new height of cinematic brilliance. This is a film to see repeatedly and to purchase for your personal library of exceptional films.  Grady Harp, March 13",5,'What have you done with my legs?'

Stephanie, a whale trainer played by the brilliant Marion Cotillard, must face life as a double amputee after a freak accident.

Stephanie&#8217;s and Alain&#8217;s lives intersect in unexpected but perfectly plausible ways, and their story generates equal parts despair and inspiration.

For a living, she trains performing killer whales.  For fun, she goes to clubs and dances until violent men force themselves upon her.  After losing her legs in an accident, she calls a bouncer who helped her one night.  He seemed dangerous too.  Turns out he is also a former kickboxer with a lot of bad habits.  As the movie progresses, she &#34;rediscovers&#34; who she was prior to losing her legs by spiraling down into a relationship with Alain that also includes managing his covert return to fighting.  In other words, aside from losing her legs, she doesn't change.Alain (aka Ali) is a bum.  He has a kid he can't take care of and he has severe emotional issues which are not explained.  He has opportunistic, violent sex with a number of women.  When he gets the chance to revive his fighting career, he gets excited.  He fights and wins.  He is even more aggressive.  He makes more bad decisions.  Near the end, he abandons everyone to go train as a fighter.  We are left to assume that this is a kind of redemptive act on his part.  However, he never really changes.  In fact, he continues to be a neglectful father to the point at which the child's life is placed in grave danger.  In other words, aside from returning to the ring, he does not change.* Whenever the movie gets slow, something bad happens to the kid.As I allude to above, there are several points in the story where something bad happens to Ali's son, and each time it is a result of Ali's neglect.  Near the end, the child almost dies.  However, when the movie ends, everything appears to be happy and fine.  This is a horrible cheap trick and in the end the characters really haven't resolved this pattern of abuse.  We have no idea if it is ongoing or not or if it will return should Ali's sudden good fortune in the ring fall flat.Holding a child hostage is a poor substitute for conflict.* So why do people like this film?I suppose people like Rust and Bone because it has an edge.  There are ugly bits of human nature revealed in the story.  There are gritty depictions of sex.  There is shocking abuse of both women and children.  All of this will set your nerves on edge, and I suppose that some people mistake the edginess they feel for some sort of artistic connection.

First the movie.The film was directed and co-written (with Thomas Bidegain) by Jacques Audiard, perhaps best known for his Oscar nominated foreign language film, ""A Prophet (Un prophete)"" from 2009.  ""Rust and Bone (De rouille et d'os)"" was expected to garner some Oscar nods as well, especially for former winner Marion Cotillard who plays Stephanie, a seemingly lonely party girl at night and a trainer of Orcas during the day.The other key player in this story is Alain (Ali) van Versch (Matthias Schoenaerts), a Belgian living in France with his 5 year old son, Sam (Armand Verdure).  Ali is broke and separated from Sam's mom.  He moves in with his sister Anna (Corinne Masiero) who is a clerk at a large discount store and her truck driver husband.  Alain gets a job as a bouncer at a night club frequented by Stephanie and rescues her when her flirtations don't go far enough for a local guy on the make.Later during a show at the water park, one of the killer whales goes awry and takes out Stephanie.  When she awakens in the hospital, both her legs have been amputated at the knee.  Now before I'm jumped for spoilers, this theme has been well publicized in trailers and even portrayed in some cover art.  Surprisingly the terrible accident isn't gruesomely displayed on screen.  Stephanie goes into deep depression.  She evidently has no family outside her co-workers.Meanwhile Alain has been earning money fighting in unsanctioned street tournaments.  In a previous life he fought as a boxer and a mixed-martial arts fighter.  It turns out he's pretty good.  One night Stephanie picks up the phone and calls Ali who does remember her.  They meet several times and in one nice scene they go to the beach.  Ali coaxes her into the water where she finally feels somewhat at home and normal.  Her shortened legs don't seem to hamper her abilities in the water.  At this point, the filmmakers could have easily taken the easy and predictable route, but the relationship remains chaste, even as Stephanie accompanies Ali to some of his fights.Finally, Ali who considers sex just a physical act, asks Stephanie if she wants to....well, you know just to see if everything still works.  Again, this could have been cheapened but somehow even with no lower legs and no make-up and stringy hair, Stephanie is still sexy as hell.  That might seem weird saying it, but I think that is the point that the filmmakers and story creator Craig Davidson had in mind.  Cotillard is brilliant as Stephanie and the chemistry between her and Schoenaerts is authentic.  I do think the ending is a bit muddled and overdone.  But this is certainly one of the better films from 2012.The Blu ray disc is as good as the film.  It comes in 1080p and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The color is really noteworthy.  There are numerous shots of the ocean and even the Orca's water tank that are sharp and realistic.  The skin tones are excellent.  The transfer has a film-like texture even though it is shot on video.  This is an excellent video presentation.  The audio, likewise is demo worthy.  It comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and it is great.  The audio here ranges from very quiet moment of Stephanie alone with her thoughts to loud crowd noises at the Orca show.  Others are more subtle, such as traffic and club scenes.  Another outstanding element to this film is an excellent soundtrack.  It features a relatively obscure Bruce Springsteen song called State Trooper remixed by TrentMoller.  It's a killer track.",4,4 1/2 stars (BLU RAY) for one of the better films of 2012,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,3734,"['was', 'one', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'local', 'multiplex', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'make', '35', 'mile', 'journey', 'take', 'So', 'here', 'Blu', 'ray', 'excellent', 'terms', 'movie', 'transfer', 'disc', 'First', 'movie.The', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'co-written', 'Thomas', 'Bidegain', 'Jacques', 'Audiard', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'foreign', 'language', 'film', 'Prophet', 'Un', 'prophete', '2009', 'Rust', 'Bone', 'De', 'rouille', 'et', ""d'os"", 'was', 'expected', 'garner', 'Oscar', 'nods', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'former', 'winner', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'who', 'Stephanie', 'seemingly', 'lonely', 'party', 'girl', 'night', 'trainer', 'Orcas', 'day.The', 'other', 'key', 'player', 'story', 'Alain', 'Ali', 'van', 'Versch', 'Matthias', 'Schoenaerts', 'Belgian', 'living', 'France', '5', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Sam', 'Armand', 'Verdure', 'Ali', 'broke', 'separated', 'Sam', 'mom', 'sister', 'Anna', 'Corinne', 'Masiero', 'who', 'clerk', 'large', 'discount', 'store', 'truck', 'driver', 'husband', 'Alain', 'job', 'bouncer', 'night', 'club', 'frequented', 'Stephanie', 'when', 'flirtations', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'enough', 'local', 'guy', 'make.Later', 'show', 'water', 'park', 'one', 'killer', 'awry', 'out', 'Stephanie', 'When', 'hospital', 'legs', 'have', 'been', 'amputated', 'knee', 'Now', ""'m"", 'jumped', 'spoilers', 'theme', 'been', 'well', 'publicized', 'trailers', 'even', 'portrayed', 'cover', 'art', 'Surprisingly', 'terrible', 'accident', ""n't"", 'gruesomely', 'displayed', 'screen', 'Stephanie', 'deep', 'depression', 'evidently', 'family', 'co-workers.Meanwhile', 'Alain', 'been', 'earning', 'money', 'fighting', 'unsanctioned', 'street', 'tournaments', 'previous', 'life', 'fought', 'boxer', 'mixed-martial', 'arts', 'fighter', 'out', 'pretty', 'good', 'One', 'night', 'Stephanie', 'up', 'phone', 'Ali', 'who', 'remember', 'meet', 'several', 'times', 'one', 'nice', 'scene', 'go', 'beach', 'Ali', 'coaxes', 'water', 'where', 'finally', 'somewhat', 'home', 'normal', 'shortened', 'legs', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'hamper', 'abilities', 'water', 'point', 'filmmakers', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'taken', 'easy', 'predictable', 'route', 'relationship', 'chaste', 'even', 'Stephanie', 'Ali', 'fights.Finally', 'Ali', 'who', 'sex', 'just', 'physical', 'act', 'Stephanie', '.well', 'know', 'just', 'see', 'everything', 'still', 'Again', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cheapened', 'somehow', 'even', 'lower', 'legs', 'make-up', 'stringy', 'hair', 'Stephanie', 'still', 'sexy', 'hell', 'might', 'seem', 'weird', 'saying', 'think', 'point', 'filmmakers', 'story', 'creator', 'Craig', 'Davidson', 'had', 'mind', 'Cotillard', 'brilliant', 'Stephanie', 'chemistry', 'Schoenaerts', 'authentic', 'do', 'think', 'ending', 'bit', 'muddled', 'overdone', 'certainly', 'one', 'better', 'films', '2012.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'disc', 'as', 'good', 'film', '1080p', '2.40:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'color', 'really', 'noteworthy', 'are', 'numerous', 'shots', 'ocean', 'even', 'Orca', 'water', 'tank', 'are', 'sharp', 'realistic', 'skin', 'tones', 'are', 'excellent', 'transfer', 'film-like', 'texture', 'even', 'shot', 'video', 'excellent', 'video', 'presentation', 'audio', 'likewise', 'demo', 'worthy', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'track', 'great', 'audio', 'here', 'very', 'quiet', 'moment', 'Stephanie', 'alone', 'thoughts', 'loud', 'crowd', 'noises', 'Orca', 'show', 'Others', 'are', 'more', 'subtle', 'such', 'traffic', 'club', 'scenes', 'outstanding', 'element', 'film', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'relatively', 'obscure', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'song', 'called', 'State', 'Trooper', 'remixed', 'TrentMoller', 'killer', 'track']",N/A

1545997,A10ZG9S13EX2AK,B0084C70NQ,Nomdefaitour,"[0, 0]","Like ""Blue is the Warmest Color"" this is just another French pornographic movie that masquerades as serious cinema by encapsulating the porn in a storyline about the lives of some very unlikable characters. Ali is a bum, who eats others' left over food; he gets marginal jobs as a guard, a street fighter for wagers, and an unlawful job ""spying"" (i.e. setting up survellience cameras) on workers in French companies (this I didn't understand: every American workplace, and virtually every public place, is watched by cameras these days; apparently it is illegal in France...good for them!). He gets his sister fired, abandons his son, and openly tells his disabled girlfriend that he has sex with other women. It's never explained why this bum is so sexually attractive that he gets so many women...the actor is ugly, and he is always unshaven, gritty, and appears unwashed. Marion Cotillard's role, who I thought was the star of this film, takes a backseat to this character; she works in a Seaworld type amusement park training Orcs and loses her legs in a freak accident (the Orcas do NOT bite off her legs). Like Ali, she apparently possesses no hair wash, definitely no make-up kit, and the film relies heavily on explicit scenes of a man having sex with a paraplegic, a turn on for some folks apparently. Very little to no character development occurs, and Cotillard doesn't seem invested in the character; I've seen interviews in which she vehemently expresses her ""politically correct"" distaste for keeping animals in captivity, and this may explain her lack of investment in the character.

The movie is directed by the guy who brought us the excellent ""The Prophet"" movie a few years ago. The movie stars Belgian actor Matthias Schoenarts as Ali, who along with his 5 yr. old son, and down on his luck, is moving in with his sister and her husband in Antibes (Southern France). Ali is the muscular type, and he finds a job as a bouncer in a local night club, where he eventually meets Stephanie (played by Marion Cotillard). Stephanie works as a killer whale trainer at the local waterpark. Stephanie is, like Ali, a strong-willed person and their relationship is not an easy one. Then a significant event occurs which turns the entire movie upside down. To give more away about the plot would really ruin your viewing experience.Let me tell you, this is one heck of a movie. Not always easy viewing, but it kept my attention fromn start to finish. Schoenarts, after his leading role in the Oscar-nominated ""Bull's Head"", confirms with this commanding, physical, and at times startling, performance that he is one of the most promising up-and-coming actors, and I am quite certain it won't be much longer before Hollywood comes knocking on his door. Marion Cotillard's performance has equally been gathering major buzz, although I found the CGI a bit off-putting. But nobody can contest that these two play out a challenging relationship on screen in a very believable and engaging (if sometimes nerve-wrecking) manner.The movie was a box-office smash in several European markets (it was playing in its 15th week in Belgium when I saw it there in late August). This movie is MILES away from your standard Hollywood action fare, or relationship fare for that matter. But if you are in the mood for a top quality foreign movie, you cannot go wrong with this.

1546001,A28TSZUILM00N4,B0084C70NQ,schumann_bg,"[1, 2]","What is happening to French cinema? In the last five years there have been very few outstanding films, with a predominance of cutesy escapism or gritty, tough thrillers. Rust and Bone is one of those films that wants to be seen as having integrity and seriousness but is actually quite commercial and lacking in depth both in the script and visual style. It relies very heavily on violence to create what the Daily Telegraph (London) describes as 'genuine power', but if you take out these events from both the lives shown, plus the further calamity that occurs, which is also violent in a sense, you would be left with an insipid drama about two people in their everyday lives shown fairly superficially.No one seems to have an inner life at all, which is particularly unsatisfactory when someone goes through something as disastrous as Marion Cotillard's character (Stephanie) does.  There is a passing attempt to show her despair, but it is so brief it hardly registers. You cannot really make an entertainment based on this kind of subject, but this film attempts to do so. It shows us beautiful actors, flattering us that we're being very compassionate and that their looks are incidental, and suggesting that Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts) is actually a very decent character under the surface, completely lacking in the bourgeois notion of fidelity, whose sexual openness allows Stephanie to unlock this side of her nature again. This is the extent, really, of its insight into 'blue collar' mores - it's hardly A Woman Under the Influence.Furthermore, the characters are not really all that likeable beyond the trait of Ali's I've mentioned - plus one nice scene on the beach where he is quite considerate - and her warmth towards his son and need for something more than quick-fix sex. Why does Ali get involved in the very sordid underground fighting scene? And how can Stephanie bear to watch him getting beaten up with hardly a flinch and even take over the organising of events? It's the kind of setup that might just about work in a genre vehicle like Steve Austin's Damage, but it's hardly adequate in a supposedly serious film. Then there's his security job which also turns out to be completely immoral ... and used for a very unconvincing plot coincidence.But to show the rather artificially souped-up emotions of the film, one scene is particularly revealing. They are in a nightclub and Ali has insensitively gone off to spend the night with another woman, not sparing a thought for Stephanie's feelings. So she is upset, understandably. At this point she is chatted up by a stranger. She has a highly alluring and revealing top on but has covered the fact she is disabled. She orders champagne, then is about to leave on her own, at which point the man notices her serious disability. In real life he would have had no need to say anything, and would have covered his surprise. I think even the crudest person would do this. But here, the realisation signals ludicrous apologies, with him saying 'I'm sorry, I had no idea', her acting incredulously, and his repeating it, really spelling it out. The purpose of the exchange is so she can get angry and smash a champagne glass in his face, causing bleeding.There is a political point being made here, clearly, but the means seems very crude. It is unconvincing on his part, and not sympathetic on hers, as she would surely have to realise that her condition would give people a jolt of surprise, especially in a pick-up situation where she is wearing a low-cut top. The emphasis of the film is too much on these kind of events ... hence my feeling that the whole exercise is a bit superficial and determined to keep sex and violence in the centre of the frame, even though in real life they generally aren't. Having said this, I loved the recent 'The Sessions', but there the actors seemed far less like stereotypes of the attractive young man and woman - neither fitted the category - and the film had real heart. I think in Audiard's film it is the cocktail of sex and violence that is the key, and the way it taps into contemporary brutalised attitudes unquestioningly - and a bit exploitatively - that jars somewhat.

Once there he gets a job as a door guard at a night club, and one evening he comes to the aid of a lady in distress. That lady is Stephanie played brilliantly by Marion Cottillard (`Contagion' and `La vie en rose'). Stephanie is an Orca trainer or killer whale trainer as we used to call these beautiful creatures. She suffers an irreversible accident whilst at work and understandably falls off the radar and becomes a virtual recluse.Then she calls up Alain and asks him to visit her as it was clear from the start that there was a spark. He duly obliges and a new relationship blossoms, however he needs some ready cash and turns to bare knuckle fist fights to make up the short fall.  What develops is a deeply engrossing and engaging tale of a journey towards each other for the two main players.This is a film by Jacques' Audiard (`A Prophet' and `The Beat My Heart Skipped') and he took his inspiration from two short stories by Canadian author Craig Davison, `Rust and Bone' and `Rocket Ride'). He has made a wonderful film which has iconic shots subtle camera work and at its centre a fiercely strong performance from Cottillard that had me gripped from the very beginning. The shots of the whales are just amazing and whilst I don't agree with such beautiful animals being held in captivity, I understand their place in this story.There is so much in this film that if you blink you will miss something. The music is great too everything from John Cooper Clark, the B 52's and Lykke Li. This is in French with really good sub titles.

Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts star in ""Rust And Bone"" (""De rouille et d'os""), Jacques Audiard's follow-up as director to Oscar-nominated ""A Prophet."" Not surprisingly Cotillard is first-billed, even though Schoenaerts's character plays a bigger role in the story. To be more precise, it seems as if two stories are vying for our attention in ""Rust and Bone,"" neither achieving its full potential.""Rust and Bone"" is about two damaged souls: St&eacute;phanie, a killer whale trainer who has a terrible accident, and Alain, a kick boxer and single father of a five-year-old son Sam. The film is basically a romance, but their romance is told with the director's unflattering descriptions of raw emotions and desires, especially the sexual ones. Two talented actors (with Marion Cotillard nominated for Golden Globe) give their all and they deserve all the praise heaped on them.The film itself is flawed, however. The story doesn't convince, with St&eacute;phanie's character development that happens in too short a time. Matthias Schoenaerts's character, driven by basic instincts, is more intriguing and convincing, even though what he goes through is after all a pretty familiar process including some plot contrivances.After all, ""Rust And Bone"" uses extreme examples of characters to attract our attention, while failing to provide any reason for us to identify with these characters, or care what these people would do.

1546011,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0084C70NQ,Turfseer,"[4, 16]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0Does 'Rust and Bone' excite you? Well, it does have a few good things about it. Principally there are those incredible special effects where they've managed to trick you into believing that Marion Cotillard who plays the protagonist's love interest, the whale-training St&eacute;phanie, is actually missing both her limbs in real life. The effects are so real that when St&eacute;phanie is injured at a local marine tourist park in an accident involving a whale she's been training, you begin to believe that her legs were superimposed through special effects, when we're introduced to the character, BEFORE the accident. Rest assured, however, it's the other way around. Ms. Cotillard indeed is fully mobile, walking about in real life, without prosthetics!Of course the most interesting thing about the film is how the romance between the aspiring kick boxer Alain and the now depressed and bereft St&eacute;phanie, develops. St&eacute;phanie has lost her confidence as a woman due to the loss of her lower extremities but eventually begins having casual sex with Alain. She begins to spend more time with him, ending up managing his kick boxing bouts. The companionship leads St&eacute;phanie to acquire artificial limbs and she gradually pulls herself out of the worst part of her depressive funk.Alain is much more problematic. He's set up as an unlikeable character so that he can have that big epiphany at film's end and redeem himself. But do you really want to go along for the ride and wait until Alain's big transformation? I don't fault him for most of his casual sex jaunts, especially because he's straight up about that with St&eacute;phanie. Of course, he does act quite crass when he walks off with a woman in front of St&eacute;phanie at the bar before their temporary separation. And what about all the kick boxing scenes? If you're not too interested in the sport (as I am), then you might not be too excited about Alain's quest to succeed in that particular sports arena.Getting back to why and how the films' scenarists strive to paint Alain in such an unflattering light, again they need that set-up to turn him into a hero so we can identify with the character at film's end. Alain hits rock bottom when his sister Anna loses her job and she blames him for setting up a surveillance camera that reveals that she's been pilfering expired food products. As a result, Anna kicks her brother out of her house and he ends up traveling away at that distant kick boxing training facility. You'll notice that Alain's 'crime' in libertarian France, was to align himself with corporate management, and install those surveillance cameras that catch people like his sister, who are only making off with expired food products.Now that tainted Alain must be redeemed, the 'Rust and Bone' scenarists resort to the old sleight of hand. Little Sam falls through the ice and despite the fact that he's in the water for any normal person to experience brain damage, Alain, utilizing those powerful kick boxing hands, cracks the ice and saves little Sam just in time to prevent him from turning into a vegetable.Now the once disgraced working-class Judas, has saved his son and gets the girl back (that of course being St&eacute;phanie). I for one would have liked Alain's redemption to be a little more subtle. But hey, you can't have everything.

Ali is a young single father who is barely scraping by; he lives with his sister and her boyfriend and works odd jobs.  Stephanie is a killer whale trainer at one of those seaworld type parks in Southern France.  They meet when Ali is working as a bouncer at a bar which Stephanie frequents.  She gets into an altercation, and Ali more or less comes to her rescue, although he also insults her.  They don't see each other again until something goes very wrong in Stephanie's life, and she turns to the brutish Ali for comfort...or something.What makes ""Rust and Bone"" interesting is the murky relationship between the two leads.  The plot is over-stuffed with drama, but fortunately the two stars are under-stated enough in their performances that the movie doesn't devolve into melodrama.  The movie ends up being believable despite certain rather unbelievable plot twists.  Cotillard and Shoenaerts are really quite spectacular; she manages to express her pain and discomfort without having endless crying scenes, and Schoenaerts effortlessly manages to be brutish, sexy, and likeable (sorta).  Cotillard deservedly received numerous award nominations (Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, Cesar, BAFTA); Schoenaerts did not receive as much attention, although he did win Most Promising Actor at the Cesars.Director Jacques Audiard frankly has done better work: Read My Lips, The Prophet, The Beat That My Heart Skipped.  However, he always puts together a good team.  The cinematography by St&eacute;phane Fontaine is top-notch, especially all of the outdoor and water scenes.  The score by Alexandre Desplat is gorgeous; I'm also always impressed by his ability to pick existing songs that perfectly accompany scenes.  Here, he uses musicians as diverse as Katy Perry, Bruce Springsteen, and Lukke Li to beautiful effect.  Add in the excellent acting, and you have a movie definitely worth a look.",4,"""You're my river running high, run deep run wild""",1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,2005,"['Rust', 'Bone', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Stephanie', 'Matthias', 'Schoenaerts', 'Ali', 'unlikely', 'couple', 'Ali', 'young', 'single', 'father', 'who', 'barely', 'scraping', 'sister', 'boyfriend', 'odd', 'jobs', 'Stephanie', 'killer', 'whale', 'trainer', 'one', 'seaworld', 'type', 'parks', 'Southern', 'France', 'meet', 'when', 'Ali', 'working', 'bouncer', 'bar', 'Stephanie', 'frequents', 'altercation', 'Ali', 'more', 'less', 'rescue', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'again', 'something', 'very', 'wrong', 'Stephanie', 'life', 'brutish', 'Ali', 'comfort', 'something.What', 'Rust', 'Bone', 'interesting', 'murky', 'relationship', 'two', 'leads', 'plot', 'over-stuffed', 'drama', 'fortunately', 'two', 'stars', 'are', 'under-stated', 'enough', 'performances', 'movie', ""n't"", 'devolve', 'melodrama', 'movie', 'up', 'being', 'believable', 'certain', 'rather', 'unbelievable', 'plot', 'twists', 'Cotillard', 'Shoenaerts', 'are', 'really', 'quite', 'spectacular', 'express', 'pain', 'discomfort', 'having', 'endless', 'crying', 'scenes', 'Schoenaerts', 'effortlessly', 'be', 'brutish', 'sexy', 'likeable', 'sorta', 'Cotillard', 'deservedly', 'received', 'numerous', 'award', 'nominations', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Screen', 'Actors', 'Guild', 'Cesar', 'BAFTA', 'Schoenaerts', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'much', 'attention', 'did', 'win', 'Most', 'Promising', 'Actor', 'Cesars.Director', 'Jacques', 'Audiard', 'frankly', 'done', 'better', 'work', 'Read', 'My', 'Lips', 'Prophet', 'Beat', 'My', 'Heart', 'Skipped', 'However', 'always', 'together', 'good', 'team', 'cinematography', 'St', 'eacute', 'Fontaine', 'top-notch', 'especially', 'outdoor', 'water', 'scenes', 'score', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'gorgeous', ""'m"", 'also', 'always', 'impressed', 'ability', 'pick', 'existing', 'songs', 'perfectly', 'accompany', 'scenes', 'Here', 'musicians', 'as', 'diverse', 'Katy', 'Perry', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'Lukke', 'Li', 'beautiful', 'effect', 'Add', 'excellent', 'acting', 'have', 'movie', 'definitely', 'look']",N/A

Street fighting for money. Dancing with whales. Fluid relationships like the employment market: you take what you can. Then you meet someone and take her home. ""No kissing, not yet,"" just penetration.My review title refers to a song heard early on in the film by John Cooper Clarke called Evidently Chickentown. The poem fits where Politics is never heard. A relationship film about left and right. But you will need some knowledge of the French language to catch that perspective. Courage is another word that comes to mind. For all the extreme events that occur in the film, it is the relationship between two young people which is most engrossing. Complimentary attraction.
