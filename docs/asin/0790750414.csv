120484,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,0790750414,A Customer,"[1, 3]","Summary:Nicholas 'Oz' Oseransky (Matthew Perry) is a struggling dentist.  His wife, Sophie Oseransky (Rosanna Arquette), is the daughter of his former business partner who also happened to embezzle a bunch of money then kill himself, leaving Oz in a lot of debt.  We don't ever know why Oz and Sophie married, but their marriage is horrible.  Then, out of the blue, Jimmy 'The Tulip' Tudeski (Bruce Willis), a former hitman for the Chicago Gogolak crime family, moves in next door.  Oz immediately recognizes him and tells Sophie, who has the brilliant idea of turning him in for the bounty on his head to pay off the loans and even entices Oz with a divorce if he'll do it.So Oz heads off to Chicago to contact the mafia while Sophie goes over to Jimmy's house and tells him what Oz is up to.  Sophie also tries to hire Jimmy to kill Oz - Jimmy is the second hitperson (I say 'hitperson' because the first was a woman) she has tried to hire for this - but Jimmy turns her down.  She then takes off to Niagara Falls and seduces a third hitperson.  Meanwhile, Oz, who never really had any intention of telling the Gogolak crime family where Jimmy was, finds himself tracked down by a member of the crime family, Frankie Figs (Michael Clarke Duncan), and taken to see the head of the family, Janni Pytor Gogolak (Kevin Pollak).  Oz is then forced to admit he knows where Jimmy lives and is going to be accompanied by Frankie back to Canada to show him.  But before he can go back to Canada, Jimmy's wife, who wants a divorce as well, Cynthia Tudeski (Natasha Henstridge), visits with him.  They fall for each other and end up having sex.When Oz gets back to Canada accompanied by Frankie, he realizes that Jimmy and Frankie are in cahoots and then participates in their plot to entice Janni and Cynthia back to Canada so Jimmy can kill them in order to withdraw ... million(s).  Janni's dad gave it to Jimmy and Cynthia as a wedding gift, but it was really just a tricky way to shelter the money from the government.  The only problem is that it requires three signatures or at least one signature and two death certificates to withdraw the money.  So, Janni is planning to kill Cynthia and Jimmy while Jimmy is trying to kill Cynthia and Janni and Oz is now in love with Cynthia but deathly afraid of everyone else.  So, Oz has to try to come up with a plan that will prevent Cynthia from being killed.the movie is very easy to follow and I won't ruin it by spoiling the end....I doubt I ever would have paid money to rent this movie, so seeing it on TV or getting it from the library was about the only way I would have been exposed to it.  As it turns out, it was on TV and I was pleasantly surprised.  Though it won't ever rank among the best movies ever made, it is kind of funny.  However, the acting isn't superb.  As much as I like Matthew Perry in Friends, he just doesn't seem to have what it takes to do movies.  Rosanna Arquette doesn't seem to be acting, and Amanda Peet comes across as a supermodel who has never acted in her life.  Perhaps that is all okay, but, other than Bruce Willis playing the tough guy role, which he does fairly well, and Michael Clark Duncan, the rest of the cast was, well, was pretty bad.The major redeeming quality was that the story was intriguing, well thought out, and funny.  There were enough twists and turns to keep you wondering what would happen next and there were no holes left in the plot, at least none that I spotted.  So, while this isn't going to win an Oscar for anyone on the cast, the movie itself might actually be fun to watch on a Friday night with a large group of friends.",2,Kind of funny.

120485,A26GKRY72ROT25,0790750414,"Amazon Customer ""HomeTheaterGuy""","[1, 2]","Since I started building up my DVD collection I would come to movies that I haven't seen so I would read the reviews from Leonard Maltin and Amazon.com essential video before I would take a chance on them. I've purchased and passed-on movies based on their reviews and I initially passed on The Whole Nine Yards after reading the review by Amazon.com essential video. Well, one day I was home and I decided to rent a DVD (which is something that I don't do often, I usually buy the movies) and finally rented this flick. Needless to say, the very first thing I did after watching the movie was order it. This movie is Hysterical!  You know, I really wonder how these critics watch movies. I mean, it seems like they don't just watch the movie and base their review on the way they feel after the movie is over but they have to analyze and dissect it to a point that makes it hard for most flicks to be perceived as a good movie. Matthew Perry is a great physical comedy actor! His performance is right up their with Chevy Chase's physical comedy! All the characters work great together and are believable in their roles. Also, for my fellow home theater owners...this movie looks and sounds awesome!  The music through out the flick is crystal clear and the gunshots are so profound, I was ducking so I wouldn't get hit!  The dialogue is pinpoint accurate and all the sounds are natural. Quick words to the critics, when watching a movie try to view it as a whole and not as a bunch of actors, scenery, storylines, cinematography, directing, musical scores and producing. The story works, the comedy works...this film works!

What Nick doesn't know is that  almost everyone wants someone dead, including him.Bruce Willis, like  in the Sixth Sense gives a great performance, without doing much.

120488,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790750414,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","This is one of those films that just makes me smile.  I know that it could have been better, but then again, I don't really see how (I mean, this film is just splendidly comical as well as dramatically intense).  I've always been a big fan of Bruce Willis, and even though he is better known for his action work, I have always considered him a stellar comedic performer, and here he gets to bare his chops front and center, stealing every scene with his sardonic portrayal of Jimmy `The Tulip' Tudeski.LOVES IT!The film revolves around two very different men.  You have the confident and very dangerous Jimmy, who happens to move in next to the very frazzled and easily used Nicolas (or `Oz' as he is referred).  Oz is a dentist who is being drained dry by his materialistic (and self centered) wife and her mother.  When he is forced into a situation that could prove life threatening, Oz finds that before long he's knee deep in with the mob and this very different man, Jimmy, becomes his life support.The film's plot has the essential twists, but nothing so overblown or over complicated that it comes off as preposterous or laughable (well, it's laughable, but those laughs are intentional).  The dialog is witty and the gags are well placed (not something I can say for that lazy sequel) but it is the performances that really elevate this film for me, and make it one I will watch again and again and again.First we have the two leads; Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis.  I like Perry, but I've always considered him the weaker of the `Friends' alumni.  This is probably his best performance outside of the TV crowd, and he really stays toe-to-toe with the rest of the ensemble; using his quirky aesthetic to his advantage.  Bruce Willis is just terrific here.  He totally gets the character (cake walk for him, I know) but he adds this added layer of comic genius to his performance.  He went to pieces in the sequel (not completely, but it was a letdown compared to this) but his take here is nothing short of genius.  The supporting cast is also top notch.  Rosanna Arquette is hilariously trashy, Amanda Peet is stunning and provocative and endearing and charming and just...WOW.  Michael Clarke Duncan is funny in all the right ways (and really needs better work) and Natasha Henstridge handles her characters dramatic edge (the most serious performance in the bunch) with that needed sharpness to keep her in range of the genre.As an ensemble piece, this is one of the best of the year.The film has its detractors (not from me, but from others) but I don't think anyone can hate this movie.  It really nails nearly everything it is going for, and it is a whole lot of fun.  It's rare that a film can combine that `fun' element with all the other elements that add up to a `great' movie.  A lot of great movies lack the fun, or visa-versa.  This is one of those films that is both.YAY!",5,"The whole nine yards, and then some!",1268092800,"03 9, 2010",2010,2894,"['one', 'films', 'just', 'smile', 'know', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'how', 'mean', 'film', 'just', 'splendidly', 'comical', 'as', 'well', 'dramatically', 'intense', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'even', 'better', 'known', 'action', 'work', 'have', 'always', 'considered', 'stellar', 'comedic', 'performer', 'here', 'bare', 'chops', 'front', 'center', 'stealing', 'scene', 'sardonic', 'portrayal', 'Jimmy', 'Tulip', 'Tudeski.LOVES', 'IT', 'film', 'around', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'men', 'have', 'confident', 'very', 'dangerous', 'Jimmy', 'who', 'move', 'next', 'very', 'frazzled', 'easily', 'used', 'Nicolas', 'Oz', 'referred', 'Oz', 'dentist', 'who', 'being', 'drained', 'dry', 'materialistic', 'centered', 'wife', 'mother', 'When', 'forced', 'situation', 'could', 'prove', 'life', 'threatening', 'Oz', 'before', 'long', 'knee', 'deep', 'mob', 'very', 'different', 'man', 'Jimmy', 'life', 'support.The', 'film', 'plot', 'essential', 'twists', 'nothing', 'so', 'overblown', 'over', 'complicated', 'off', 'preposterous', 'laughable', 'well', 'laughable', 'laughs', 'are', 'intentional', 'dialog', 'witty', 'gags', 'are', 'well', 'placed', 'not', 'something', 'can', 'say', 'lazy', 'sequel', 'performances', 'really', 'elevate', 'film', 'make', 'one', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'again.First', 'have', 'two', 'leads', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Perry', ""'ve"", 'always', 'considered', 'weaker', 'Friends', 'alumni', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'TV', 'crowd', 'really', 'toe-to-toe', 'rest', 'ensemble', 'using', 'quirky', 'aesthetic', 'advantage', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'just', 'terrific', 'here', 'totally', 'character', 'cake', 'walk', 'know', 'added', 'layer', 'comic', 'genius', 'performance', 'went', 'pieces', 'sequel', 'not', 'completely', 'was', 'letdown', 'compared', 'take', 'here', 'nothing', 'short', 'genius', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'Rosanna', 'Arquette', 'hilariously', 'trashy', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'stunning', 'provocative', 'endearing', 'charming', 'just', 'WOW', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'funny', 'right', 'ways', 'really', 'better', 'work', 'Natasha', 'Henstridge', 'characters', 'dramatic', 'edge', 'most', 'serious', 'performance', 'bunch', 'needed', 'sharpness', 'keep', 'range', 'genre.As', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'one', 'best', 'year.The', 'film', 'detractors', 'not', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'can', 'hate', 'movie', 'really', 'nearly', 'everything', 'going', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'rare', 'film', 'can', 'combine', 'fun', 'element', 'other', 'elements', 'add', 'up', 'great', 'movie', 'lot', 'great', 'movies', 'lack', 'fun', 'visa-versa', 'one', 'films', 'both.YAY']",The Whole Nine Yards VHS

Miles,"[2, 2]","What would you do if a well known Chicago Mafia hit man (Bruce Willis), fresh out of prison with 17 murders to his credit moved in next door to you? Do you let your obnoxious, overbearing wife talk you into ratting him  out to his former boss so you can collect on the contract on his head? Well  most of wouldn't, but then most of us don't have Nicholas Oseransky's life.  Matthew Perry plays the beleaguered young dentist struggling to run a  Canadian dental practice steeped in debt due to his late father-in-laws  embezzlement. His wife (Rosanna Arquette) and mother-in-law want him dead,  and so it seems does everyone else he meets. Mix all of this with a couple  more hit men, and beautiful woman, and a homicidal mod boss and you have a  very enjoyable comedy.Perry is hilarious as the very likeable ""Oz""  who gets tossed into harms way, and struggles to stay alive and manages to  fall in love along the way. He once again proves that he is the funniest of  the ""Friends"" cast, and that he has a natural knack for comedy timing.  Willis is very subdued as the hit man in suburbia trying hard to find a  reason not to kill his new neighbor. Willis sometimes has a tendency to  play over the top like in ""Die Hard"" or too flat like in ""The Jackal"" but  here I think he has found just the right tone for his character. The cast  is rounded out nicely with Kevin Pollack (The Usual Suspects), Natasha  Henstridge (Species), Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile) and Amanda  Peet.Willis still has a tremendous presence, but Perry carries the  film with his combination of sarcastic wit, and physical schtick.  Arquette's character is a bit too annoying, but luckily she doesn't have a  whole lot of screen time. ""The Whole Nine Yards"" is overall a good movie.

That the movie is still fun and amusing is a tribute to the actors that have great fun with their roles.  The story follows a dentist (Matthew Perry) and his new next-door neighbour, a hitman (Bruce Willis) that squealed on his former employers for a plea-bargain.  Needless to say the surviving gang-members want revenge.  Add to the mix the dentist's wife who wants him dead for the insurance money, and his receptionist, a hit-woman wannabe.  What follows is a string of twists and turns where several characters get ""whacked"" with the dentist somehow in the middle of it all.The movie works because of the characters.  There are no surprises - Bruce Willis is his standard John MacLane / boxer in Pulp Fiction character.  Matthew Perry's dentist is a re-edit of Chandler from Friends.  However, we feel immediate comfort and sympathy for the characters because they are so familiar.  Good performances are also put in by Michael Clarke Duncan as another hitman and Amanda Peet as the wannabe hitwoman.  Peet especially brings such joy and energy to the role that it's hard not to smile whenever she's onscreen.  Likewise for Willis.  Perry plays clumsy and earnest simultaneously, to good effect.Some people will be turned off by the large body count, and fail to find the gallows humour funny.  Others will decry the restraint in the violence (as compared to Natural Born Killers or Pulp Fiction) - for example, there is never any blood shown after people are shot.  For me, the violence is sufficiently cartoon-like that the spell of the humour is not broken.  Unfortunately, the film is not particularly memorable and tends to be somewhat predictable.  This DVD version is very plain with only a director's commentary and little else.

Willis revels in his usual deadpan style where he has some great one-liners, with Duncan managing to convey menace as well as humor almost in parallel. Perry as the much harassed dentist has a gift for comic timing and comes off well by and large except for his romance with Natasha Henstridge which totally fails to connect.

Well, comedies have done this since the times of the ancient Greeks, so what's the problem? Well, it all depends on (a) the motive of the perp(s), (b) the character of the victim(s), (c) the degree of harm done, and (d) the outcome of the plot. Here, the  perps all have a smarmy side, including the often-adorable Rosanna Arquette and the so-far-adorable Amanda Peet. One of the victims is a ""good cop"" (NOT a cop on the take or who's abusing his power). He is distracted by Peet who flashes her  [...] and then he's killed. And Willis & Co. all get away with whatever they do, including betraying some of their own. Funny? >sign&lt; Not to me.In his Preface to JOSEPH ANDREWS, a wonderful comic novel, Henry Fieldling rightly points out that normal audiences/readers do not find it funny when a good person is harmed.Around 50 years ago, Charles Addams published a cartoon in the NEW YORKER magazine, showing ""Uncle Fester"" in a movie theater, giggling, while the rest of the audience are all shedding tears. This cartoon shows what I call ""the pervert factor"": when good people are harmed, only perverts laugh.Overall this tired, cliche-ridden film has no one for us to care about and has the moral center of (if you can believe any of the newspapers) the top executives at Enron.

The cast is great starting out with the marvelously talented Bruce Willis.  Matthew Perry, Rosanna Arquette, Michael Clarke Duncan, Amanda Peet.  The premis is perfect for this sort of dark comedy.  The main character played wonderfully by Matthew Perry is funny, sharp witted and makes you get in the guys' corner right from the start.  The man has more than a couple of reasons to suck carbon monoxide but he continues on in spite of being a dentist married to a shrew that wants him dead for monetary reasons, his new neighbor is a nororious hit man for the Chicago mob that has anger management problems, and his dental receptionist is secretly a beginner in the hit man game plotting his demise for his shrew wife.  There, now the story is set except for the romantic interest the gorgeous Nastasha Henstridge who just happens to be the wife of Bruce Willis, Matthews' new neighbor.  I tell you, what's not to like about this mix of dripping satire and ill born love at first sight.  On the surface the movie seems like another one of the usual Hollywood ""just for the money"" movies, but, give it a chance and it will definitely grab your attention despite a short sequence of gratuitous T&A featuring Amanda Peet that really isn't needed.  All told you have a witty, funny and very entertaining movie that you will want to enjoy again and again.  What can I say about the comic genius of Bruce Willis, a man that can bring off the comedic punchline as well as chill you to the bone with characters like the Jackal.  Matthew Perry is a very funny part of this movie with just enough slapstick and not too much to irritate.  Sometimes the critics are looking for more than us average viewers are looking for and that is their job, but sometimes the critics forget that the word entertainment literally means to ""not think"".

There is nothing about this film that in any way distinguishes it from the sea of hit man/mob comedies floating around.And let me say this, if it weren't for Bruce Willis and his wonderfully funny performance as the sensitive hit man, Jimmy `The Tulip' Tudeski, ""The Whole Nine Yards"" would've been a complete disaster.  Willis, even through some of the weaker scenes, elevates the performances of his costars (Matthew Perry, Amanda Peet, Natasha Henstridge, and Rosaana Arquette) and the overall quality of the film with his powerful star presence.Honestly, I expected more from this film.  More laughs, to be precise.  When you have a film and its whole premise is ridiculous to begin with and with each scene gets progressively goofier, one expects some serious humor.

However, it takes a certain sense of humor to enjoy it.  There are two facets to the humor.  The first is the physical comedy of Matthew Perry, which is mostly pratfall  humor.  I enjoy such slapstick if it doesn't go overboard (like when he  bangs his head on the steering wheel; the first time was funny the second  time was overkill) but mostly Perry stays on the funny side of  fatuous.The second facet was situational comedy where everyone was put  in peculiar situations and forced to make decisions about how to behave.  This was the stronger element of the film and though the dialogue was often  weak, the situations were droll and often produced hysterical  results.The directing by Jonathan Lynn was straightforward, giving Perry  wide latitude on shaping his character and much of the comedy.  From what I  understand, Perry was improvising about half the time, which clearly gave  the film a comedic boost.The acting was generally good.  Bruce Willis  plays the straight man as a contract killer with a sense of humor.  Willis  is always understated in his comedy roles, which was perfect considering  Perry's antics.  Mostly Bruce just looked tough and smirked a lot.  Matthew  Perry was full of energy and spontaneity.  He tended to go overboard at  times, but he produced a lot of great sight gags and frenetic humor, which  more than compensated for his excesses.Michael Clarke Duncan once  again makes a tough guy affable.  I always enjoy his work.  Natasha  Henstridge took her role far too seriously, playing it more like a gangland  drama than the comedy it was.  Amanda Peet's main purpose in this film was  to take her top off and create a distraction.  In that regard, she  succeeded nicely.  Rounding out the cast was Rosanna Arquette, whose French  accent was terrible, but she was amusingly nasty in the villain  role.Overall, this was a good comedy for people who enjoy inane low brow  humor.  I am one of those people so I gave it a 7/10.

It isn't easy to pull off an off-beat film like HAROLD &amp; MAUDE, which is a classic example of the genre.  In comparison, THE WHOLE NINE YARDS is far from being a great film, but it provides enough laughs to give one a smile and a fun time.  While the movie is somewhat slow at the start, it picks up steam later. Most of that is due to the two leads in Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis.  Matthew Perry makes good use of his &quot;Friends&quot; mannerisms as the put-upon Canadian dentist who finds himself living next door to an infamous hit-man. Bruce Willis is solid as the hit-man with a heart, while Natasha Henstridge is lovely to look at as Willis' estranged wife.  However, Amanda Peet theatens to steal the show with her funny turn as a hit-man groupie/wannabe. The one bad performance in the film is provided by Rosanna Arquette, who plays Perry's wife with an accent that would make even Pepe Le Pew cringe.

120531,A1NP3OU0YILKSR,0790750414,Joel Cobbs,"[0, 0]","Introduction:From the beginning, we see a man in a terrible relationship who wants out but is dutifully standing by his wife.  Everyone around him sees what he doesn't (or maybe what he has just accepted).  Matthew Perry does a fabulous job, though this is often the character he plays in films and TV shows.  He has the sarcastic, slightly-neurotic character down pat.  If you enjoy that character, you'll enjoy his role here.  Willis does a good job of playing a lovable hitman with some unusual morals, but who stands by them nonetheless.Why did you choose this rating?This is a funny movie with some great one liners and good character chemistry.  It is entertaining and definitely worth rewatching time and again.  It's by far one of the best Matthew Perry movies out there.  However, there is a lot of profanity and nudity in it (and I don't mean partial nudity.)What did you like or dislike?I liked the story.  There are so many plot twists you catch many of them the second and third times you watch it.  The dialogue between the characters is sharp and witty, filled with sarcastic spats but also lines that make you laugh out loud.  My favorite line is with Willis and Perry.Willis: &#34;Do you like living in Canada?&#34;Perry: &#34;No.  I live here with my wife.&#34;I am not a fan of the nudity in the film.  I felt it those parts could've been avoided or at least hinted at instead of fully shown.  I understand their context within the movie, but I still think it could've been passed on for something better.Who would you recommend this product to?This is for those who enjoy original comedies and aren't easily offended by sexual scenes and profanity.

The first is this: &quot;Gee, that was a pretty good black comedy, and as a bonus they even threw in Matthew Perry doing a funny Jerry Lewis schtick.&quot;  Your  other response, however, might be this: &quot;Gee, that was a pretty funny  black comedy, but too bad they had to mess it up by throwing in Matthew  Perry doing that stupid Jerry Lewis schtick.&quot;  I sort of felt the  second way, but to each his own, as they say.  Amanda Peet's eye-opening  extended nude scene (she gets naked to create a distraction) will also  induce one of two responses.

I won't  tell you which camp I'm in on that one.  Ahem, let's move on.

Bruce Willis, Matthew Perry, Michael Clarke Duncan, an attractive trailer, and a hitman comedy with a similar premise to The Big Hit. Unfortunately, The Whole Nine Yards does not deliver the goods such as The Big Hit did, and it is a very disappointing film.Oz (Matthew Perry) is a dentist living in a suburban area, and trying to cope with debt. When a new neighbour moves in next door, he recognises him as &quot;The Tulip&quot; (Bruce Willis), an infamous gangster hit man. Tulip, however, is out of favour with his former employers, and Oz's wife blackmails Oz into giving the hit man up to the Mafia boss who wants him dead. This is complicated by Oz becoming friends with Tulip.The comedy in this film is very funny in places, and The Whole Nine Yards can often raise a smile and be quite creative with it's characters, but there are no `thrills' you don't see coming from the very start. It's basically just old Bruce Willis back to play old Bruce Willis, while Matthew Perry reaches about the same comedic standards as he did in Fools Rush In. That wasn't a plausible amount of talent. While Michael Clarke Duncan and Amanda Peet are both enjoyable to watch, they can't save this mess of a film that shoots at a target and repeatedly misses it's goal.Although sometimes enjoyable, this comes off as a major letdown, and is a fairly below par outing for Bruce Willis.",2,Could've been so much more...,983577600,"03 3, 2001",2001,1419,"['Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'looked', 'divine', 'paper', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'attractive', 'trailer', 'hitman', 'comedy', 'similar', 'premise', 'Big', 'Hit', 'Unfortunately', 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'not', 'deliver', 'goods', 'such', 'Big', 'Hit', 'did', 'very', 'disappointing', 'film.Oz', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'dentist', 'living', 'suburban', 'area', 'trying', 'cope', 'debt', 'When', 'new', 'neighbour', 'moves', 'next', 'door', 'quot', 'Tulip', 'quot', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'infamous', 'gangster', 'hit', 'man', 'Tulip', 'however', 'favour', 'former', 'employers', 'Oz', 'wife', 'Oz', 'giving', 'hit', 'man', 'Mafia', 'boss', 'who', 'dead', 'complicated', 'Oz', 'becoming', 'friends', 'Tulip.The', 'comedy', 'film', 'very', 'funny', 'places', 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'can', 'often', 'raise', 'smile', 'be', 'quite', 'creative', 'characters', 'are', 'thrills', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'very', 'start', 'basically', 'just', 'old', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'back', 'play', 'old', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'same', 'comedic', 'standards', 'did', 'Fools', 'Rush', 'was', ""n't"", 'plausible', 'amount', 'talent', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'mess', 'film', 'target', 'repeatedly', 'goal.Although', 'sometimes', 'enjoyable', 'off', 'major', 'letdown', 'fairly', 'par', 'outing', 'Bruce', 'Willis']",The Whole Nine Yards VHS

It is a terrific black comedy, with wonderful performances by Matthew Perry, the ever cool Bruce Willis, Michael Clarke Duncan, and a break out performance by Amanda Peet. Quite frankly, the movie is just plain hilarious, and a little gem of a film which one could happily see again and again, as I already have, and laugh each and every time.Matthew Perry is wonderful as the hapless everyman, a dentist who finds himself living in Canada with his witchy French-Canadian wife who is, decidedly, not in love with him. His shrewish wife, played by Rosanna Arquette with a French accent which is over the top and laughable, wants to have her husband bumped off for insurance money.As luck would have it, a notorious Chicago based hit man, with a mob contract out on his own life, just happens to move in next door to the unhappily married duo. This hit man, coolly played to perfection by Bruce Willis, meets his neighbor, Matthew, who also happens to be from Chicago. Bruce looks familiar to Matthew who ultimately recognizes him for who he is. While initially unnerved by Bruce, they somehow hit it off.Matthew, however, foolishly tells his wife that he believes the neighbor to be a hit man with a price on his head, and the games begin. She sends Matthew to Chicago to have him give up their neighbor, the hit man, for the contract money. Matthew goes, mainly to appease her, as he really has no intention of giving up his new found friend.Meanwhile, no sooner does he leave, than she herself goes to the neighbor to give her husband up in hopes that he will get rid of her husband for her. In the interim, Matthew is met in Chicago by Michael Clarke Duncan who takes him to the mob boss who wants to bump off Bruce. There, Matthew meets Bruce's wife, with whom he becomes smitten. What transpires next compels Matthew to return to Canada, where he gets the surprise of his life. This all sets in motion a series of events which will have the viewer howling with laughter.Needless to say, there are numerous unexpected twists and turns in this movie, all of which contribute to its success as a black comedy. This film is, undoubtedly, one of the best in this genre. Michael Clarke Duncan, who also happens to play a hit man, gives an ingratiating performance as Bruce Willis' buddy. Amanda Peet is absolutely hilarious as a hit man wanna be. I do not want, however, to give away any more of the plot. Suffice to say, watch this film. You will not be disappointed. In fact, you will be too busy, laughing up a storm.

This time the subject was the best movie comedies ever made. I mention this because, in the last several years, I have not found myself laughing that much at the movies. I was getting the feeling that I had either lost my sense of humor or had simply seen too many movies. In this latest list, the top honors went to 1959's Some Like it Hot and 1982's Tootsie. Only three movies from the 1990s made the grade, and I now feel that perhaps the problem has been the pictures and not me. That's why I am happy to say that The Whole Nine Yards, though not very original, is, indeed, quite funny.Nicholas ""Oz"" Oseransky [Matthew Perry] is a dentist with a ton of trouble. He is living in Quebec now because his father-in-law, his business partner back in Chicago, embezzled all the profits. His wife, Sophie [Rosanna Arquette], is the meanest, most self-centered woman in the world, except perhaps for her mother who lives with them. His dental practice in Quebec is not a big success.One day a new neighbor moves in, and the affable Oz goes over to introduce himself. While talking to the man, Oz suddenly realizes he is talking to Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tudeski, Chicago's most notorious hit man. The minute he gets back home, he hysterically screams at the women to start packing. Sylvia doesn't see a problem. She knows Jimmy ratted out the powerful Gogolak gang, which is looking for him. Why doesn't Oz take a trip to Chicago, meet Yanni Gogolak, and get a finder's fee? When Oz refuses, she threatens to take him to the cleaners in a nasty divorce. Oz goes to Chicago with no intention of doing her bidding. One thing leads to another, and he winds up meeting Gogolak anyway. Meanwhile, Sophie goes next door and tells Jimmy what Oz is up to. It seems Oz has a million dollar life insurance policy. Soon, everyone is out to get everyone else.What's keep The Whole Nine Yards going isn't the writing, though it's funny, nor the plot, which is very similar to Analyze This. It's the cast. Every performer gives the impression that they are having a very good time. They are exuberant.

120556,A3CCQKKTL7M189,0790750414,MIKE PHILLIPS,"[0, 1]","The Whole Nine Yards is one of those pictures that starts off slowly, despite the fact that all of the characters are in place by the first 15 minutes. That is, they are introduced, but you really don't get to know  them until the story progresses. Matthew Perry plays a displaced dentist  living in Canada w/a hateful wife &amp; mother in law. Despite being a  doctor, he is poor due to the fact that he is still paying off his fathers  underworld debts. That's when Timmy the Tulip, a hitter from Chicago moves  next door. Things take off from there. And although this has as many twists  and turns as ,say, Blood Simple, the movie is nowhere near as high brow and  the audience can usually guess the twists before they happen. Critics have  said that Perry's comedic timing was sharp in this film. I found them a bit  off the mark. I think he was much funnier in Fools Rush In. Who really  shines in this film is Bruce Willis. Never has the box office mega star  given a performance that was so un-effacing and underscored as this. Forget  his mega movies like Armeggedon and Sixth Sense. This is Willis at his  best. In fact, I haven't liked him in a role so much since Pulp Fiction (  which may be an odd comparison, but true nonetheless).The busy ending keeps  this predictable movie from totally sinking into mediocrity ( aside from  Willis' performance). The one thing that didn't really fit Perry's  character however, was his seemingly disregard about the death of the under  cover police officer. His character keeps stating that he doesn't want  anyone killed because of him, including the bad guys, but when the under  cover cop is offed, he doesn't seem to mind. In fact, he uses that, or  rather the writers use that, as a way to tie up the loose plot end of his  scemeing x-wife &amp; mother in law. I guess that was about the only way  they could wrap up that plot line, but still it seemed out of place &amp;  out of character.

There is scarcely a moment in the film that is not at least chuckle-worthy!  Even the minor characters (mother-in-law, mob henchmen, Canadian cops, dental patients) are flawlessly played.  Matthew Perry is absolutely brilliant, and Bruce Willis underplays his role in perfect counterpoint to Perry's over-the-top goofiness.  Nothing is missing:  there's suspense, action, plot-twists, surprises, sight-gags, slapstick, and glib repartee galore to give you sniggers, chuckles, guffaws, and outright belly-laughs throughout.

120566,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0790750414,Reviewer,"[3, 3]","Is a guy who has killed seventeen people necessarily a &#65533;bad&#65533; guy?  Not a question everybody is going to have to ask themselves, to be sure, but what if that guy moved in next door to you?  It&#65533;s a situation that just may induce an introspective moment or two.  Which is exactly what happens in &#65533;The Whole Nine Yards,&#65533; directed by Jonathan Lynn and starring Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry.  Hit-man Jimmy &#65533;The Tulip&#65533; Tudeski (Willis) ratted out his boss in Chicago, and now he&#65533;s on the lam.  He makes his way to Canada, where he buys a house next door to a hapless dentist, Nicholas &#65533;Oz&#65533; Oseransky (Perry), who is suffering from inherited debts and a shrew of a wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), not to mention a mother-in-law from Hell (Carmen Ferland).  When he realizes who his neighbor is about to be, his first instinct is to run, but Sophie has other ideas.  It seems there&#65533;s a price on Jimmy&#65533;s head; one Janni Gogolack (Kevin Pollak) would like to take his revenge on the guy who&#65533;s responsible for his father going away for a long, long time.  So Sophie squeezes Oz into a corner until he agrees to go to Chicago and meet with Janni to put the finger on Jimmy.  Not a great idea, Oz thinks, but it at least sounds like a nice vacation, so he goes.  But, of course, he should have stayed with his instincts, because he soon finds himself looking down the barrel of trouble.  And the only way out, it seems, is down...What Lynn put together here is actually a fairly light-hearted, black comedy; the nature of the story dictates that there will be violence in it, and there is, but much of it is implied rather than graphic.  The pace is good, and Lynn develops the characters enough to let you know exactly who they are and what they are all about.  There&#65533;s not a lot of depth, but it&#65533;s not necessary; the actors have each made their respective characters unique to a point that puts them beyond stereotype, and it works perfectly for this film and the story.  Some of what happens is inevitable, though not necessarily predictable, and certain aspects will keep you guessing right up to the end.  Typical of a comedy that leans to the dark side, nothing in this story is cut and dried.Willis is perfect as Jimmy The Tulip, giving a rather reserved, subtle performance that puts Jimmy&#65533;s guarded but confident manner into perspective.  Underneath it all, this guy is really rather cold-blooded (he has to be, given his choice of employment), but his relationship with Oz gives it some warmth, at least externally.  Like Chow Yun-Fat in &#65533;The Killer,&#65533; Jimmy is likable, but when you consider at arm&#65533;s length who he is  and what he is capable of, it&#65533;s a bit disconcerting.  And that&#65533;s one of the aspects of the film that is so interesting-- because you know who and what Jimmy is, you never really know which way things are going to turn.Perry is excellent, as well, as &#65533;Oz.&#65533;  Henpecked and in dire straits, he is something of an updated version of the W.C. Fields character in &#65533;It&#65533;s A Gift&#65533; or &#65533;The Bank Dick,&#65533; although a bit darker.  Perry is charismatic, has impeccable timing with his delivery and uses physical comedy to great effect.  His reactions to Willis and the situations in which he finds himself are brilliant and hilarious, and he seems to instinctively know just how far to take it to make it work.  And it&#65533;s the little, seemingly insignificant things he brings to the character that give the film that extra something and creates some memorable moments.The supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Frankie Figs), Natasha Henstridge (Cynthia), Amanda Peet (Jill St. Claire), Harland Williams (Special Agent Hanson) and Serge Christianssens (Mr. Boulez).  It may not be the most original movie ever made, but &#65533;The Whole Nine Yards&#65533; is funny, has a great cast of actors who have taken characters you&#65533;ve basically seen before and made them their own, and does exactly what a film like this is supposed to do:  Entertain.  It&#65533;s not going to make you ponder the universe or the state of the world today, but it&#65533;s going to give you a couple of hours of laughs and some residual chuckles.  Which, when you think about it, is not such a bad deal.

Bruce Willis plays Jimmy &quot;The Tulip&quot; Tudeski, a former  professional hitman who moves in next door to Matthew Perry.

120574,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0790750414,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","Coming as it does so hot on the heels of the recent `Analyze This' and `Mickey Blue Eyes,' `The Whole Nine Yards' is, regrettably, not as fresh as  it might otherwise have been. Here again we have the tale of an Average  Joe/ Everyman type, who, through a set of quirky and bizarre circumstances,  finds himself, totally against his own will and better judgment, knee-deep  in mob-centered activities.The film's chief strength, beyond the  uniqueness of its French Canadian setting, rests in the cleverly convoluted  plot writer Mitchell Kapner and director Jonathan Lynn have concocted  centered around a Montreal dentist named Oz whose life takes a decidedly  dramatic turn when a hit-man-turned-informer known as Jimmy `The Tulip'  Tedeski moves in next door. This happenstance sets in motion an amazing  roller coaster ride for Oz as he becomes enmeshed in internecine squabbles  between assorted gangster hit men, marital entanglements involving himself  and Jimmy's beautiful wife and burgeoning true love.Unfortunately, the  weakness of the film also rests in its screenplay whose humor is often too  broad, too self-conscious and too reliant on conventional double takes -  particularly on the part of the understandably befuddled and flabbergasted  Oz - to be truly funny. There is no denying the fact that the film does  generate an impressive amount of raucous energy - but without the wit  necessary to bring out the subtle nuances of the material, the movie ends  up tiring us out long before the midpoint of its 100-minute long running  time.The acting, too, seems rather uneven. As Oz, Matthew Perry tries  hard to nail down the part, but he simply lacks the charisma necessary to  pull off a role of this magnitude. He ends up delivering a one-note  performance consisting mainly of non-stop dithering. And how long ago was  it that Rosanna Arquette once seemed to be a fine actress? As in most of  her recent performances, she simply relies on superficial mannerisms to  build her character - that of Oz's utterly amoral (and unconvincingly  French-accented) wife whose villainy must be a crucial element in the  film's overall credibility. She seems to be playacting rather than truly  exploring the subtle depths of her character. Even comedy requires an edge  and this Arquette will not (or perhaps cannot) provide.On the positive  side, Amanda Peel provides spunk and energy as a neophyte `hit woman' who  literally salivates at the thought of meeting her `hero,' the  world-renowned Jimmy `The Tulip.' Which brings us to the real quality  element of `The Whole Nine Yards' - Bruce Willis' first-rate interpretation  of the killer-next-door. In a performance of sustained multi-leveled  complexity, Willis provides the perfect combination of sly devilishness,  steely-eyed seriousness and understated affability essential to making  Jimmy a truly likeable comic villain. Willis really seems to be having the  time of his life in this role. Unfortunately, thanks to an overall lack of  originality in the film's conception and a script that seems less humorous  than it might have been, the same cannot be said for the audience.",2,tepid gangster comedy,965088000,"08 1, 2000",2000,3148,"['Coming', 'so', 'hot', 'heels', 'recent', 'Analyze', 'Mickey', 'Blue', 'Eyes', 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'regrettably', 'not', 'as', 'fresh', 'might', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'Here', 'again', 'have', 'tale', 'Average', 'Joe/', 'Everyman', 'type', 'who', 'set', 'quirky', 'bizarre', 'circumstances', 'totally', 'own', 'will', 'better', 'judgment', 'knee-deep', 'mob-centered', 'activities.The', 'film', 'chief', 'strength', 'uniqueness', 'French', 'Canadian', 'setting', 'rests', 'cleverly', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'writer', 'Mitchell', 'Kapner', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Lynn', 'have', 'concocted', 'centered', 'Montreal', 'dentist', 'named', 'Oz', 'life', 'decidedly', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'when', 'hit-man-turned-informer', 'known', 'Jimmy', 'Tulip', 'Tedeski', 'moves', 'next', 'door', 'happenstance', 'motion', 'amazing', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'Oz', 'enmeshed', 'internecine', 'squabbles', 'assorted', 'gangster', 'hit', 'men', 'marital', 'entanglements', 'involving', 'Jimmy', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'burgeoning', 'true', 'love.Unfortunately', 'weakness', 'film', 'also', 'screenplay', 'humor', 'often', 'too', 'broad', 'too', 'self-conscious', 'too', 'reliant', 'conventional', 'double', 'particularly', 'part', 'understandably', 'befuddled', 'flabbergasted', 'Oz', 'be', 'truly', 'funny', 'denying', 'fact', 'film', 'generate', 'impressive', 'amount', 'raucous', 'energy', 'wit', 'necessary', 'bring', 'out', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'material', 'movie', 'up', 'tiring', 'out', 'long', 'midpoint', '100-minute', 'long', 'running', 'time.The', 'acting', 'too', 'rather', 'uneven', 'Oz', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'hard', 'nail', 'down', 'part', 'simply', 'charisma', 'necessary', 'pull', 'off', 'role', 'magnitude', 'up', 'delivering', 'one-note', 'performance', 'consisting', 'mainly', 'non-stop', 'dithering', 'how', 'long', 'ago', 'was', 'Rosanna', 'Arquette', 'once', 'seemed', 'be', 'fine', 'actress', 'most', 'recent', 'performances', 'simply', 'superficial', 'mannerisms', 'build', 'character', 'Oz', 'utterly', 'amoral', 'unconvincingly', 'French-accented', 'wife', 'villainy', 'must', 'be', 'crucial', 'element', 'film', 'overall', 'credibility', 'be', 'playacting', 'rather', 'truly', 'exploring', 'subtle', 'depths', 'character', 'Even', 'comedy', 'edge', 'Arquette', 'will', 'not', 'perhaps', 'can', 'not', 'provide.On', 'positive', 'side', 'Amanda', 'Peel', 'spunk', 'energy', 'neophyte', 'hit', 'woman', 'who', 'literally', 'thought', 'meeting', 'hero', 'world-renowned', 'Jimmy', 'Tulip', 'Which', 'real', 'quality', 'element', 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'first-rate', 'interpretation', 'killer-next-door', 'performance', 'sustained', 'multi-leveled', 'complexity', 'Willis', 'perfect', 'combination', 'sly', 'devilishness', 'steely-eyed', 'seriousness', 'understated', 'affability', 'essential', 'making', 'Jimmy', 'truly', 'likeable', 'comic', 'villain', 'Willis', 'really', 'be', 'having', 'time', 'life', 'role', 'Unfortunately', 'thanks', 'overall', 'lack', 'originality', 'film', 'conception', 'script', 'less', 'humorous', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'audience']",The Whole Nine Yards VHS

If you have, you're sharing your paranoia (or maybe not, he he he), with dentist Nick Oseransky  (played by the bumbling and adorably clumsy Matthew Perry). He has an awful  wife (played by Roseanna Arquette) who chain smokes and plans absurd ways  to make money. Suddenly, who moves in next door then Timmy 'the Tulip'  Tedeski (played by the anyman actor Bruce Willis). Timmy used to be a  contract killer for a Hungarian crime mob and this, as you can imagine,  makes Nick a little nervous. But there's more, a lot more! I don't want to  give any more away, I'll just say that there are great performances by  Amanda Peet as a wanna-be contract killer, Micheal Clark Duncan as Freddie  Friggs, one scary big guy, and Kevin Pollack as Vinny, another one of the  guys invovled with getting 'the whole nine yards'.  The thing that makes  this movie great is great performances. I've never seen Matthew Perry  better then here(except maybe on 'Friends, but that's another story)and as  one of Amanda Peet's first movie roles, I thought she was pretty funny too.  But still I say again that the stand-out was Matthew Perry. He's really a  guy to watch. He reminded me a little of Kramer from 'Seinfeld'. Rent this  movie and try it out.

120580,AKP40TIE5SVSQ,0790750414,Some Gravity,"[0, 0]","I have always been a huge fan of comedy films,and I have always enjoyed black comedy also--comedy that is a little dark usually tends to be interesting,and that is how it works--you get comedy with a little bit of chemistry to it. And how does one of the first(if not the first)black comedy films of 2000,THE WHOLE NINE YARDS,meausure up? Read on for my review of this:Nicholas ""Oz"" Ozeransky(Matthew Perry)is a very unhappy dentist who lives in Canada.His wife,Sophie(Rosanna Arquette)is pretty much a pain in his rear end,and the only reason he married her was because he had to. Things can't be worse for Oz,and it seems that to him that he will be unhappy for the rest of his life.And then,one day,something strange,surprising,and something a little bit creepy happens. When Oz is outside,he sees that he and his wife have a new neighbor. And after talking to this new neighbor,Oz discovers that the new neighbor is Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tudeski(Bruce Willis)a hitman who has killed over twenty people and sends tulips to his victim's funerals. Oz has known who Tudeski is for several years now,and once he finds out that Tudeski himself is his new neighbor,he wants to leave Canada--right here and right now. But his wife isn't up for that. It turns out that Tudeski is hiding out from Janni Gogolak(Kevin Pollak)one of his(Tudeski's)former partners,so Sophie has the perfect plan. The plan is that Oz will fly to Chicago(where the Gogolak family hangs out),meet Yanni himself,and tell him that he knows where Jimmy is. Oz goes--except he is not even up there to rat out Jimmy. The only reason why he is really up there is because Sophie has promised him the divorce he has wanted for years now if he does that for her,and he just wants her off of his back. But when Jimmy has word of everything and sends his former partner Frankie Figgs(Michael Clarke Duncan)up to Chiacgo to find Oz,Oz really is in for a meeting with Yanni Gogolak,and then,several funny,dark,and hillarious events happen.I really enjoyed THE WHOLE NINE YARDS. It is my favorite black comedy film,as well as one of my favorite movies of all time. The chemistry here is really funny--and I like the performances in this film a lot also. Matthew Perry is sort of Chandler in Canada in this film,and Bruce Willis is kind of both David Addison and John McClain--except this time,he is a hitman. Having Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry in a movie together was a really smart idea,because in this film,both Willis and Perry work together really well. I'd say that this film shows Bruce Willis,Matthew Perry,and Michael Clarke Duncan at their best comedically. And with a funny story,a funny script,and a DVD with cool bonus feautures(an interview gallery with the cast,the film's theatrical trailer,filmographies,among other cool bonus feautures)THE WHOLE NINE YARDS is one film(and one DVD)you can't go wrong with.Highly Recommended!",5,Black Comedy at It's Best,1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,2897,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'comedy', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'black', 'comedy', 'also', 'comedy', 'little', 'dark', 'usually', 'be', 'interesting', 'how', 'get', 'comedy', 'little', 'bit', 'chemistry', 'how', 'one', 'first', 'not', 'first', 'black', 'comedy', 'films', '2000', 'THE', 'WHOLE', 'NINE', 'YARDS', 'meausure', 'up', 'Read', 'review', 'Nicholas', 'Oz', 'Ozeransky', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'very', 'unhappy', 'dentist', 'who', 'Canada.His', 'wife', 'Sophie', 'Rosanna', 'Arquette', 'pretty', 'much', 'pain', 'rear', 'end', 'only', 'reason', 'married', 'was', 'had', 'Things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'worse', 'Oz', 'will', 'be', 'unhappy', 'rest', 'life.And', 'then', 'one', 'day', 'something', 'strange', 'surprising', 'something', 'little', 'bit', 'creepy', 'happens', 'When', 'Oz', 'outside', 'wife', 'have', 'new', 'neighbor', 'talking', 'new', 'neighbor', 'Oz', 'new', 'neighbor', 'Jimmy', 'Tulip', 'Tudeski', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'hitman', 'who', 'killed', 'over', 'twenty', 'people', 'tulips', 'victim', 'funerals', 'Oz', 'known', 'who', 'Tudeski', 'several', 'years', 'now', 'once', 'out', 'Tudeski', 'new', 'neighbor', 'leave', 'Canada', 'right', 'here', 'right', 'now', 'wife', ""n't"", 'up', 'out', 'Tudeski', 'hiding', 'out', 'Janni', 'Gogolak', 'Kevin', 'Pollak', 'one', 'Tudeski', 'former', 'partners', 'so', 'Sophie', 'perfect', 'plan', 'plan', 'Oz', 'will', 'fly', 'Chicago', 'where', 'Gogolak', 'family', 'out', 'meet', 'Yanni', 'tell', 'where', 'Jimmy', 'Oz', 'not', 'even', 'there', 'rat', 'out', 'Jimmy', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'really', 'Sophie', 'promised', 'divorce', 'wanted', 'years', 'now', 'just', 'off', 'back', 'when', 'Jimmy', 'word', 'everything', 'former', 'partner', 'Frankie', 'Figgs', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'Chiacgo', 'find', 'Oz', 'Oz', 'really', 'meeting', 'Yanni', 'Gogolak', 'then', 'several', 'funny', 'dark', 'hillarious', 'events', 'happen.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'THE', 'WHOLE', 'NINE', 'YARDS', 'favorite', 'black', 'comedy', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', 'chemistry', 'here', 'really', 'funny', 'like', 'performances', 'film', 'lot', 'also', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'sort', 'Chandler', 'Canada', 'film', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'kind', 'David', 'Addison', 'John', 'McClain', 'time', 'hitman', 'Having', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'movie', 'together', 'was', 'really', 'smart', 'idea', 'film', 'Willis', 'Perry', 'work', 'together', 'really', 'well', ""'d"", 'say', 'film', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'best', 'comedically', 'funny', 'story', 'funny', 'script', 'DVD', 'cool', 'bonus', 'feautures', 'interview', 'gallery', 'cast', 'film', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'filmographies', 'other', 'cool', 'bonus', 'feautures', 'THE', 'WHOLE', 'NINE', 'YARDS', 'one', 'film', 'one', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'with.Highly', 'Recommended']",The Whole Nine Yards VHS
120581,ANHGGQT4HTEK0,0790750414,Sonia,"[1, 3]","The Whole Nine Yards falls neatly into a recent phenomenon of crime comedies, where the bad guys are bad, and funny at the same time.  The movie- goer is prompted to still laugh at the guy who just blew away three other guys from the rival gang.We meet Nicholas ""Oz"" Oseransky, a nervous dentist, played aptly by Matthew Perry, in a loveless marriage to Sophie, played by Rosanna Arquette.  The setting is Montreal, Quebec, where for the sake of the movie apparently, no one speaks French.  Wait, there are some lounge singers that sing a song in French.  The rest of the characters are all transplanted Americans who get along seamlessly in Montreal without speaking a lick of the native tongue.  With one exception, Sophie is French Canadian, but I don't think I've seen that bad of a butcher job since Sam the Butcher on The Brady Bunch.  Rosanna Arquette can't act her way out of a paper bag, so by all means, don't ask her to also try to do an ACCENT!  Thank God her part is minor, because it was nails on a chalkboard listening to her.The loveless marriage between Oz and Sophie is the catalyst for the rest of the story.  Sophie complains constantly about the fact that he's a poor dentist and all their money problems would be solved in an instant if he were dead and she could collect on his life insurance.  About that time, Oz sees the moving truck next door, unloading the earthly possessions of one Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tudeski, a Chicago contract killer who has moved to Canada to avoid the gang he ratted out in order to serve a lighter prison sentence.That's the easy part, it gets much more confusing before everything is all said and done.  Jimmy, played with ease by Bruce Willis, has no intention to sit back and breathe in that fresh Canadian air for the rest of his days.  There's a matter of some ten million dollars that he'd like to collect.  Only problem is, a couple people have to be dead in order to get it.  One is his wife, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge) and the other is the head of the Gogolak gang, Janni (Kevin Pollack), the very same gang Jimmy ratted out.So, the Gogolak gang wants Jimmy dead, Jimmy wants Janni dead, he also wants his wife dead, and Sophie wants Oz dead.  The beauty of it, is all the talk about killing and any actual killing that does happen, is all done in a comedic manner, so its really more of a comic element than anything else.This is obvious when, during a trip to Chicago, Oz attempts to collect a ""finder's fee"" from the Gogolak gang about his information on the whereabouts of Jimmy ""The Tulip"".  Oz finds himself smitten with Cynthia, and who wouldn't?  She's tall, graceful and utterly gorgeous.  I wanna look like that.  The fact that I've been five feet tall since sixth grade, I'm not going to hold my breath.  But, I bet I was better at ""Smear the Queer"" than Natasha Henstridge.  But I digress....Amidst all the turmoil, and backstabbing in the movie, Oz vows to the lovely Cynthia, ""I'm not gonna let anybody kill you,"" to which she responds, ""Under the circumstance, I think that's the most romantic thing I've ever heard.""  Ahhh, love.  See guys?  You didn't have to go buy your sweetie something sparkly for her finger for Valentines Day, all you have to do to really get a woman to swoon is promise her you won't let anyone kill her.  What could be sweeter?The movie is chock full of hit man stereotypes, which, if you are gonna do a comedy of this nature, you might as well do the stereotypes to the hilt and set aside any attempts at any concrete individuals.  Michael Clarke Duncan plays Frankie Figs, and not only was he fabulous in The Green Mile playing a serious, compelling character, he can also stand on his own in a comedic role.Matthew Perry is cast perfectly as the nervous dentist.  He's got pratfalls throughout and all the dentist-related scenes are some of the funniest of the film.  Imagine some of the things you hate about going to the dentist.  Ever had a tooth drilled?  Ever had your tooth drilled by a dentist who's hand is shaking from all the tension of being a mob target?  They keep throwing in a lot of dentist jokes, which I'm not sure if dentists will appreciate or not.Aside from all the killing, is the primary goal to see who, if anyone, will manage to get the ten million bucks, or ""the whole nine yards"".  See, you knew that phrase had to be in the movie somewhere!  The R rating is for violence (obviously), language, nudity and a brief sex scene.  So parents, don't send Junior off for this one until you've seen it first.  The Whole Nine Yards is quick paced after a somewhat slow beginning.  The main plot line is interesting enough with some engaging sub-plots as well as some plot elements that were unnecessary, like all the information about Sophie's father.  There are some cute jokes that run throughout, like the fact that in Canada, you will get a hamburger with mayo on it, which makes my tastebuds curl up at the thought of it.And, hey, who says you can't learn any valuable life lessons from a comedy?  At one point, Jimmy tries to impress upon Oz, ""It's not important how many people I've killed.  It's important how I get along with the people who are still alive.""The Whole Nine Yards is clever, but also flawed.

The Whole Nine Yards showed a very very different Bruce Willis, but  people would love it. After the thriller of the Sixth Sense and the warm  Story of Us, Bruce became the &quot;thrilling gangster and killer&quot; in  the Whole Nine Yards. In fact, there was not much huge breakthroughs in his  facial expressions, but that made him cool and interesting in the  movie.Matthew Perry acted in his usual way, but was far more funnier  than him in Three to Tango. His disgusting wife and his cute little nurse  had supported and reflected the character of his role completely, so when  added with the funny acting of Matthew, it could just drive you nuts from  time to time.The story was funny in a way that there was a change of  position for all the major characters in the movie, and you would not find  the change of position awkward. Matthew Perry, a good and honest dentist  who was originally a prey of his wife, was finally turned out to be one of  the big winners in the movie. The gradual reveal of the true identity of  some of the characters in the movie did provide many good turning points  for the continuation of the movie. The relationship among different  characters also got more and more complicated during the progress of the  story, and that made it more interesting rather than confusing. The plot  was well written and organised.The movie could be regarded as a black  comedy but I think is a pretty clean and funny black comedy that offers a  good time for enjoyment.",5,Laughter gas bomb by Matthew and Bruce,966297600,"08 15, 2000",2000,1566,"['Have', ""n't"", 'thought', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'could', 'make', 'film', 'so', 'interesing', 'funny', 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'showed', 'very', 'very', 'different', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'people', 'would', 'love', 'thriller', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'warm', 'Story', 'Us', 'Bruce', 'became', 'quot', 'thrilling', 'gangster', 'killer', 'quot', 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'huge', 'breakthroughs', 'facial', 'expressions', 'made', 'cool', 'interesting', 'movie.Matthew', 'Perry', 'acted', 'usual', 'way', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'funnier', 'Three', 'Tango', 'disgusting', 'wife', 'cute', 'little', 'nurse', 'had', 'supported', 'reflected', 'character', 'role', 'completely', 'so', 'when', 'added', 'funny', 'acting', 'Matthew', 'could', 'just', 'drive', 'nuts', 'time', 'time.The', 'story', 'was', 'funny', 'way', 'was', 'change', 'position', 'major', 'characters', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'find', 'change', 'position', 'awkward', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'good', 'honest', 'dentist', 'who', 'was', 'originally', 'prey', 'wife', 'was', 'finally', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'big', 'winners', 'movie', 'gradual', 'reveal', 'true', 'identity', 'characters', 'movie', 'did', 'provide', 'many', 'good', 'turning', 'points', 'continuation', 'movie', 'relationship', 'different', 'characters', 'also', 'got', 'more', 'more', 'complicated', 'progress', 'story', 'made', 'more', 'interesting', 'rather', 'confusing', 'plot', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'organised.The', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'regarded', 'black', 'comedy', 'think', 'pretty', 'clean', 'funny', 'black', 'comedy', 'good', 'time', 'enjoyment']",The Whole Nine Yards VHS
