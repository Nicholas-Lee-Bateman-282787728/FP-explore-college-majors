When going out into the sun for a &quot;tan&quot;, he turns into the Hideous Sun Demon,  it's a kind of Jekyll and Hyde tranformation in the sense that when he turns into this monster he starts to lose it. This movie is boring, trust me I have seen enough classic horror films and I have the right to call this one boring(I am not saying classic horror films are boring if that the impression you got). This movie just doesn't have that creepy atmosphere that the Universal classic horror collection had, not at all, nothing ever really sets the mood in this film either, it could have been great, I loved the idea and the design of the monster still remains one of my all-time favorites but I just didn't find myself enjoying this, maybe Robert Clark shouldn't have tried to do too much at once. I loved the design of the navigation menu, it looked really classic, there is a trailer for your viewing pleasure, enjoy at your own risk. The Hideous Sun Demon!

Oerman ""Andy Oerman""","[18, 21]","I could go on ad infinitum about all the things that are wrong with this film, those that make it so earnestly campy or inept or histrionic or unintentionally funny or even surreal. I could tell you it's 'so bad it's good.' But that wouldn't really fill you in, as such a statement can be interpreted many ways by many different people.There are also a surprising number of things the film manages to do competently. Listing those to someone contemplating purchasing this dvd might even be counterproductive. So I will refrain.The simplest, most telling review I can write is this:The star, Robert Clarke, while wearing the rubber Sun Demon costume during filming in the hot Southern California sun, sweated profusely. The sweat ran down his torso and to his trousers. This gives the appearance during the latter stages of this movie that the Hideous Sun Demon was unable to control his bladder.If the above sounds funny to you, you will like the movie.See also: Village of the Giants; Astounding She-Monster; Teenagers From Outer Space; Attack of the 50-Foot Woman (1958)",5,One of the all-time &quot;greats.&quot;,1031875200,"09 13, 2002",2002,1072,"['could', 'go', 'ad', 'infinitum', 'things', 'are', 'wrong', 'film', 'make', 'so', 'earnestly', 'campy', 'inept', 'histrionic', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'even', 'surreal', 'could', 'tell', ""'so"", 'bad', 'good', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'fill', 'such', 'statement', 'can', 'be', 'interpreted', 'many', 'ways', 'many', 'different', 'people.There', 'are', 'also', 'surprising', 'number', 'things', 'film', 'manages', 'do', 'competently', 'Listing', 'someone', 'contemplating', 'purchasing', 'dvd', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'counterproductive', 'will', 'refrain.The', 'simplest', 'most', 'telling', 'review', 'can', 'write', 'star', 'Robert', 'Clarke', 'wearing', 'rubber', 'Sun', 'Demon', 'costume', 'filming', 'hot', 'Southern', 'California', 'sun', 'sweated', 'profusely', 'sweat', 'ran', 'down', 'torso', 'trousers', 'appearance', 'latter', 'stages', 'movie', 'Hideous', 'Sun', 'Demon', 'was', 'unable', 'control', 'bladder.If', 'above', 'funny', 'will', 'like', 'movie.See', 'also', 'Village', 'Giants', 'Astounding', 'She-Monster', 'Teenagers', 'Outer', 'Space', 'Attack', '50-Foot', 'Woman', '1958']",N/A

What will his friends think? And the local police have plans of their own.Producer and actor Robert Clark, of whom you may remember from ""The Man from Planet X"", takes us on a tour of Los Angeles. We go on a fun romp through sunny Southern California. Just looking at the 1959 technology and early pictures of Signal Hill are worth the film in itself.

More's the pity, I would have enjoyed that, instead, it's presented as hearsay, the result of a hangover.  Basically, the slander has it that Dr. Gil is a drunk and clumsy.  His bad luck continues; the poor sot is maltreated in a hospital to a moment in the sun.  The consequences are catastrophic.  But all is not lost there might be a cure, if allowed to experiment on him.  ""Half human, half lizard and I'm a guinea pig..........!""  Apparently, he also can't make up his mind as to what he's become.  (Loved the extreme close-up of his anguished puss, you could count ever pore!)  Naturally, he soon contemplates an act of desperation.  How handy, a cliff nearby.  Instead of jumping, he does the very thing that got him into this mess, goes to a bar and drinks himself silly.  Ooo-la-la there's a lousy lounge singer to ogle.  (Here's a tip, can I chuck change into your cleavage?)  Of course a bar brawl ensues.  Gil escapes with the singer.  They park and he whips out his flask.  ""You're a strange guy.""  (And you're a cheap floozy, race ya to the beach!)  As day will follow, the sun comes up forcing poor Gil to escape...........in a convertible......ditching the lounge singer with just his coat and a smile on her face.  The poor dear had to hitch home.Being a creature of habit, Gil will keep changing at inopportune moments and soon becomes a dog killer!  He also dispatches a rather unpleasant thug and throws a fit of hysterics.  ""I couldn't help myself, I murdered someone, I wanted to kill him!""  (Back off, I'm after an Oscar!)  Well, you can't murder someone without a tally being taken.  Things do not turn out well for poor Gil.I have to confess that I loved this film.  I haven't laughed this hard in ages.  It was as lousy as claimed and I couldn't be the happier for it.  It's definitely going in my collection with the rest of the unfortunate duds.

It starts well as a psychological study of a lonely man who is forced to live alone at night as radiation has changed his cell structure so that he becomes a lizard monster during the day time. This scientist, Gil, is also a womanizing alcoholic whose impulses get him into bar fights, abandoning a woman on the beach, crashing cars, and so forth. The film goes over the well-trod Jekyll-Hyde motif in which as the lizard man he becomes violent, homicidal, and runs around a lot. 50 minutes into the movie it ceases to be a psychological study and becomes a one-dimensional monster on the loose film. It ends badly, with the lizard man shot and falling from a huge tank. It is hard to have any sympathy for Gil McKenna, as he cannot help going into a bar and getting into trouble even after previous bad experiences in that bar. Obviously the scientist was a compulsive party boy. The science used to explain it all is Darwinian evolution in reverse, including a completely unnecessary explanation of how a fetus evolves in the womb to other scientists who should already know all that.

Full of booze and paranoia, our hero takes up with a saloon singer while his sweetheart is left to fret.Silly science and lots of fiction (and skimpy budget), prevents this particular cautionary tale against &quot;tampering with the Unknown&quot; from being in a league with other radiation-based monster movies. There are some great scenes (mostly with the monster lying in wait to attack), but be ready for some over-the-top acting (and just plain bad acting by some inexperienced cast members!), and some el-cheapo effects work.The filmmakers do make up for a lack of budget with some creativity and imagination, but what really saves this little film is the excellent use of location shooting. Real-world venues take center stage (especially during the climactic oil tank battle hundreds of feet high up), with startling footage of oil pumps, tank farms, and girders that easily make us overlook any weaknesses in acting or effects. And to be honest, the rubber suit and mask are pretty effective.You'll have fun with this one, as long as you aren't expecting a slick big-budgeter.

264856,AST7UNIXVOAVA,6301773403,Mark Shanks,"[16, 16]","Well, now, from the cover of this one, you'd think that this was lower down on the evolutionary scale than plankton. Actually, it falls somewhere between the whole-heartedly &quot;serious&quot; sci-fi flicks of the 50s  (like &quot;Them!&quot; and &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;) and  the **real** bottom-of-the-barrel stuff like &quot;The Amazing Colossal  Man&quot; and &quot;Beast From the Haunted Cave&quot;. True, true, you do  have to have a taste for cheese to really enjoy these things, and this one  doesn't disappoint. Our hero is quite the booze-hound, but that didn't keep  his friend from recommending him for his current job (somewhat unclear -  apparently it involves unloading isotope bars off of a toy railroad...! )  One day, he shows up to work with a hangover (his loyal assistant insists  it was &quot;just a headache&quot;!), and the next thing he knows - he's  been exposed to &quot;5 or 6 minutes&quot; of radiation. That's enough -  remember, this was made back in the days when anyone capable of using the  words &quot;isotope&quot; and &quot;radiation&quot; in the same sentence  was definitely some kind of Poindexter.The interesting thing about this  film (besides the rubber-suited lizard man) is that it doesn't seem to  matter to anyone that, hey!, we have this guy who turns into a Hideous Sun  Demon, and they don't keep him around for observation. &quot;Just stay out  of the sun.&quot; Okie-dokie! Good news is that he's still  very much the  booze-hound, and therefore we get to spend time following him around,  looking for bars at night - looks downright noirish for a while, and by all  means stick around for the stacked blonde singing the &quot;Love Song From  Hideous Sun Demon&quot;, aka &quot;Strange Pursuit&quot; (what a title!  What a song! What kind of piano is that woman playing, anyway? )Still,  our director and star did his best with this one - some of the scenes are  really well composed (there's one scene near the beginning that looks as  though Ansel Adams could have shot it) and it has a far more polished feel  to it than SO many of these movies. (Ugh - if you haven't sat through a  Francis Coleman movie, you have no right to pass judgement on THIS one!)  The DVD transfer is completely acceptable (what, you're waiting for the  widescreen edition? I don't think so....) even if it doesn't really have  any extras (other than the liner notes, which put the whole thing into  perspective). There's some film scratchiness but mostly it's pretty decent  B&amp;W - not too washed out, not too contrasty. It even has the  usually-deleted &quot;rat scene&quot; (you'll know what I'm referring to as  soon as you see it).All in all - I recommend it to ANY fans of the  genre. Not as well known as a lot of the familiar turkeys, better than most  of them if not overly-ambitious or special in any way.

To call it an auteurist project might be somewhat far-fetched, but this is about as personal as a low budget science-fiction film can possibly be. The way it blends several genres - sci-fi, horror, film noir - and B-film conventions (notably the curse of the werewolf) is odd and generally successful. The title creature manages to stand out in the massive crowd of 1950s monsters for three reasons: 1) it actually looks very good, 2) its appearances are judiciously scattered throughout the film, and 3) these scenes are directed with a keen sense of pace and suspense. There is little doubt that Clarke's elliptical storytelling is partly due to the minimal budget, but it is artistically rewarding as well: the abrupt introduction, the first transformation scene and the final showdown are impressive and memorable, true highlights among 1950s B-films.

Now whenever he's exposed to the sun, his cells revert to an earlier evolutionary stage, turning him into a hideous lizard-man.  He doesn't want to stay in the hospital or around any people, so he isolates himself at home by day, and goes out to the bar for drinks at night - a habit he couldn't break even before his radiation-condition.  At the bar he meets a pretty girl and, too intoxicated to remember his codition, takes her to the beach for a midnight swim.  The time gets away and before you know it the sun's coming up.  He abondons the girl and speeds home just in time.A radiation specialist comes to help, but in the meantime Clarke sneaks out to the bar again and trouble - the girls boyfriend, a mean big thug, beats him up.  The girl takes him home, but her boyfriend shows up again by daylight and forces him outside, where you can guess the rest.  In case you can't guess, he turns hideous and kill the boyfriend, and spends the rest of the movie on the lam, and hideous.The plot is nothing new, like several dozen other movies before it.  Clarke also directed, competently, but some of the acting is pretty bad (far from the worst though, compared to some other cheap sci-fi flicks).

A sure sign of a real classic, the star of the movie, Robert Clarke, is also the writer, the producer, and the director. A scientist suffers accidental exposure to radiation. In a variation of the classic werewolf theme, sunlight makes Gil break out in a lizard shirt and horrific head mask. His metamorphosis leads to violent behavior. Gil meets a low rent Marilyn Monroe ... lounge-singer named Trudy (as in a ""true D-cup,"" subtlety abounds). He sniffs around her by night, but then the sun rises and he is off again on more mayhem that is decidedly violent. The film has typical stairwell quality sound, dismal B&W photography, and ersatz science pontifications (""Darwin was never even close!""). True to low budget traditions, instead of movie studio sets, the cast and crew ventured out on the streets of L. A. to film this epic. Gil has a date with destiny high atop a huge oil storage tank, shades of Jimmy Cagney. There is a determined effort to create a sense of tragedy in Gil's sad fate. In spite of its cheap look, this film is slightly better than average, very slightly. The Elvira Mistress of the Dark edition includes her hilarious introduction and epilogue. The delectable B Queen offers plunging comments and well-rounded remarks in a pointed and thrusting manner.

Where today's films try to shorten the title as much as possible(the cool sounding ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" on it's 100th remake is now simply ""Invasion""), the classic schlockers tried to make it as grandiose as possible.  Some films made a point to tell us where the film's creature was coming from, be it ""outer space"" or ""beneath the sea"", etc.  Then there's a few that liked to throw in an adjective to describe the ""monster"" of the film-We know the shrinking man is ""incredible"" or that the she-monster is ""astounding"".  And the sun demon?  Well, he's hideous!  How'd he get that way?  Well, he's actually Dr.Gilbert McKenna(Robert Clarke in a kind of schlock Clint Eastwood mode, taking on both starring role and director duties).  McKenna drops some experimental isotope(he was hungover.  McKenna has a weakness for the sauce) and infects himself with some wacky form of radiation.  Now somehow, his cells regress back to their prehistoric origins and he turns into a kind of homicidal lizard man.  It's kind of like a reverse werewolf curse as this only happens when he's exposed to sunlight.  Scientists try to isolate McKenna and figure out how to cure him, but this is a monster movie, and we know that McKenna will manage to slip up and end up in the sunlight.  His love of the booze helps out in this as he becomes smitten with a nightclub singer and ruffles the feathers of some Al Capone type gangster dude(though he reminds me more of that little gangster with the big hat from the Bugs Bunny cartoons).  So when the sun demon isn't out terrorizing folks and brutally killing dogs, he's either being poked by scientists, poking the nightclub singer or boozing it up.The Hideous Sun Demon is one of the more entertaining of it's kind.  The film's soundtrack will sound familiar as it's the same music used in Romero's Night of the Living Dead.

Apparently conceived as a sensitive portrayal of the inner torment of a man possessed by a strange condition beyond his control, they just didn't have the budget to bring it off. Besides, it's hard to work up sympathy for a character who, after being told by his doctor to stay home and not drink any alcohol, immediately heads out to the bar. Then there's the bosomy b-girl who's just had her boyfriend and his thugs work over our hero, who turns around and starts consoling him and takes him home.

For cheese lovers there's plenty of bad acting and that let's-talk-about-it-cause-we-can't-afford-to-show-it thing going on.

Basically, another fun hour-and-ten for the bad cinema set.Image's DVD presents the movie in the best edition I've seen yet.

Other than the horizontal scratches, it blows the socks off my Starlog Video VHS copy, and if you're used to catching this on the late night monster shows you'll probably be quite pleased.

The central idea here is that an accidental radiation overdose causes a scientist (Robert Clarke) to morph, or ""de-evolve,"" into a scaly reptilian monster whenever he is exposed to sunlight. There are many interesting directions that the filmmakers could have taken this concept, but none of them show up in the film. In the end, ""The Hideous Sun Demon"" is like an episode of ""Seinfeld""--it's really about nothing at all.Some of today's sophisticated viewers may chuckle at the rubber creature costume, but I have no complaints about the ""special effects."" By the standards of the day, and considering the small production budget, the monster is actually nicely detailed and quite convincing, for the few brief moments that it appears on-screen. The crisp black-and-white photography is also excellent, featuring some striking, stark, deeply shadowed ""noir-like"" scenes that look great in this full-screen digital transfer. There are some muddy scenes in which day turns into night through the miracle of gross underexposure, but that technique was common at the time. The biggest problem with ""The Hideous Sun Demon"" is that there is no meaningful story, and essentially no character development. You never get to the point where you care about the scientist, the monster or anyone else.On balance, ""The Hideous Sun Demon"" is not a bad film--it's just not much of a film at all. It's easy to watch, reasonably well-made and the DVD is relatively cheap. Completists can certainly justify buying it to round out their collection of 1950s sci-fi movies.
