It had amazing cinematography, creepy scenes, and an ending you don't see coming, but as ""Paranormal Activity"" came into the mainstream, that quickly became my absolute favorite and I started to forget about ""The Uninvited"". I also realized that the ending really wasn't anything new to psychological horror, but it still has it's twists that make it different from other psycho-horrors. ""The Uninvited"" is based on a 2003 South Korean horror film, called ""A Tale of Two Sisters"". It's another one of those American horror films that are remakes of Asian films, but out of all the others, (""The Ring"", ""The Grudge"", ""One Missed Call"", etc.), this is one of the smartest remakes. It has creepy pop-outs and nice suspense all the way to it's fulfilling ending.

1238074,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001U0HBQA,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","Hey!  I wrote a review for this movie last year.  Where is it?  What did you do with it amazon???  Reviews don't just vanish in the night like Jack the Ripper!The Uninvited is about a girl who has agoraphobia- a fear of public or enclosed places.  Hey wait!  I may be partially agoraphobic.  I have a fear of public places but NOT enclosed places.  Stuck in the middle, just like the way it's always been.  Meh, I doubt I have anything close to what the woman who stars in the Uninvited has.  At least, not if this ""potentially far-fetched for the purpose of entertaining horror fanatics"" movie is any indication.Anyway the movie is about a young woman who either experiences symptoms of agoraphobia or perhaps this is Hollywood's exaggerated version of agoraphobia- I'm not knowledgeable enough in the subject to determine which one.The girl (played by Emily Browning... I think) spends most of her time fighting these symptoms inside her home.  Her much older husband who's more appropriate as a father-figure (and perhaps should have been written into the script as such) is sometimes around to lend help, but often is out of town on business trips or wherever husbands go when the wife is stuck at home having problems in these type of thriller movies.  Unfortunately if you have no personal experience with agoraphobia that either you or someone close to you has experienced, the Uninvited is going to present itself as a big, confusing mess with little to no logical explanation for any of the events taking place.  And surprise surprise- that's the predicament I'm facing right now.  How do I rate such a movie?Basically the girl spends her days touching and feeling walls to make sure they're actually there, believing that something bad is about to happen at all times so she takes an extremely cautious approach to everything, sees distorted walls and shadow figures either outside the front door or inside her house, and hides under a blanket in bed assuming it's a safe protective place to stay without anybody harming her in any way, etc.This is honestly too much for me to understand.  It basically means that, if you run with the agoraphobic or any phobia gimmick, you can practically do *anything* you want to warp the viewers imagination.  However the consequence is not much in the way of coherent or logical writing material so many of us end up starring at the TV screen in confusion.I can sum up the Uninvited like this- the actual horror is just a series of severe symptoms of agoraphobia with added sound effects making the condition appear as frightening/disturbing as possible.  With that said, it's not a bad movie- at least all the confusion provides several moments of uncertainty and unpredictability.  That's better than being bored. It's pretty much what saves the Uninvited from being a disastrous movie.Update- July 16, 2013.  Wow, and I thought the agoraphobia plotline was confusing- amazon said that I have NOT written a review for this movie, so when I went to type a review, guess what happened?  The original review I wrote on December 12th of last year magically appears on page 2 but NOW it's the new review I'm writing down right now, replacing the old one.

A strange-yet it works well at times-mixture of drama, suspense, some frights, and some good old fashioned mystery, The Uninvited may come off as at first being just another remake of an Asian horror film.But it manages to be so much more that that, and although it is not perfect, The Uninvited has to be the best remake of a Asian film i've ever seen.Anna (Emily Browning) has just been released from a mental institution 10 months after her mother's death, and is finally going home now, to her boyfriend, her writer dad, and her, well, lets just say outgoing sister. But arriving home she finds a newer surprise...Rachel (Elizabeth Banks, showing her creepy side). She used to be her mother's maid, and just so happened to have the night off when Anna's mom blew up, along with the rest of the gasoline-filled boathouse where she was staying. Anna now thinks that Rachel killed her mom, along with some other kids from past experices; Anna basically thinks that Rachel is a serial killer, now after her and her sister.And that is just the beginning of he plot. There's a whole lot more going on in this movie, almost too much for its tight 87-minute running time, but The Uninvited still manages to wrap everything up in the end, along with a couple (did I say A LOT?) of plot twists and changes.But too-crazy-for-itself plot is the only problem in the movie; the casting and acting is pitch-perfect. Browning, aside from her terrible fake crying, plays the part well, Alex, her sister, makes you truly believe her plot that Rachel is the bad guy, and the father truly looks like he's fallen into Rachel's hands just like a puppet. Yet nobody does a better job at playing their role than Elizabeth Banks does playing Rachel, everything about her-her evil looks, her evil motions, even her voice at time (""I won't allow it..."") is creepy. Banks always does a good job in her roles, but this role is truly convincing to watch, even if you don't like the rest of the characters.So in the end this is probably the best remake of an Asian horror flick out there, and if you want solid acting and a somewhat-solid story, The Uninvited would be your best bet around.",4,For Whom the Bell Tolls...,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,2279,"['Uninvited', 'DVD', 'ReviewGrade', 'B', 'person', 'whom', 'bell', 'tolls', ""n't"", 'always', 'person', 'think', 'strange-yet', 'well', 'times-mixture', 'drama', 'suspense', 'frights', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'mystery', 'Uninvited', 'may', 'come', 'off', 'first', 'being', 'just', 'remake', 'Asian', 'horror', 'film.But', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'not', 'perfect', 'Uninvited', 'be', 'best', 'remake', 'Asian', 'film', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Anna', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'mental', 'institution', '10', 'months', 'mother', 'death', 'finally', 'going', 'home', 'now', 'boyfriend', 'writer', 'dad', 'well', 'just', 'say', 'outgoing', 'sister', 'arriving', 'home', 'newer', 'surprise', 'Rachel', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'showing', 'creepy', 'side', 'used', 'be', 'mother', 'maid', 'just', 'so', 'happened', 'have', 'night', 'off', 'when', 'Anna', 'mom', 'blew', 'up', 'rest', 'gasoline-filled', 'boathouse', 'where', 'was', 'staying', 'Anna', 'now', 'Rachel', 'killed', 'mom', 'other', 'kids', 'past', 'experices', 'Anna', 'basically', 'Rachel', 'serial', 'killer', 'now', 'sister.And', 'just', 'beginning', 'plot', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'going', 'movie', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'tight', '87-minute', 'running', 'time', 'Uninvited', 'still', 'wrap', 'everything', 'up', 'end', 'couple', 'did', 'say', 'LOT', 'plot', 'twists', 'changes.But', 'too-crazy-for-itself', 'plot', 'only', 'problem', 'movie', 'casting', 'acting', 'pitch-perfect', 'Browning', 'aside', 'terrible', 'fake', 'crying', 'part', 'well', 'Alex', 'sister', 'truly', 'believe', 'plot', 'Rachel', 'bad', 'guy', 'father', 'truly', 'fallen', 'Rachel', 'hands', 'just', 'puppet', 'nobody', 'better', 'job', 'playing', 'role', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'playing', 'Rachel', 'everything', 'her-her', 'evil', 'looks', 'evil', 'motions', 'even', 'voice', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'creepy', 'Banks', 'always', 'good', 'job', 'roles', 'role', 'truly', 'convincing', 'watch', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'rest', 'characters.So', 'end', 'probably', 'best', 'remake', 'Asian', 'horror', 'flick', 'there', 'want', 'solid', 'acting', 'somewhat-solid', 'story', 'Uninvited', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'bet', 'around']",N/A

Early on, the directors keep us guessing if The Uninvited is going to be a traditional thriller with the evil stepmom or a supernatural thriller with the vengeful ghost of the mother? The filmmakers apply the usual scare tactics with sudden jolts but nothing truly horrifying, more like the fleeting thrills one gets on a rollercoaster. The typical nightmarish imagery is duly trotted out (keyholes that drip blood, creepy dead people coming back from the grave, and so on) but it isn't anything that hasn't been done a million times before.If you've seen enough of these kinds of films, it is pretty easy to predict what happens next in The Uninvited except for a nutty twist ending which kind of comes out of left field. Although, in the case of this film that's not necessarily a bad thing. There's something pleasant in familiarity and The Uninvited certainly delivers in this respect.There is an ""Alternate Ending"" which spells things out a little bit more but in a completely unnecessary way.Also included are four deleted scenes with more of Anna's homecoming.

But do not under any circumstances watch the special feature 'Unlocking the Uninvited' before you watch this movie; unless you want the ending completely spoiled.At first it felt like a pretty standard pot boiler summer horror movie. The opening scene is a guy making out with a girl on the beach while everyone else is drunk. He wants to go farther, she gets up and leaves. In the scary woods, with the ominous music she runs into a garbage bag that was predictably scary. The directors threw in a little twist that actually made it a bit funny. It's that little twist, that sense of humor that made this film work for me. It took the first 20 minutes before I was won over by this film. Watch for the best joke of the film, Alex comes home drunk; she walks away from Anna and mumbles something on her way to the bathroom. After that, I was bought in, and played along exactly the way the director and writers wanted me to play - go ahead think hard about the film and try to figure it out.The story is about two sisters, Anna who spent time in an insane asylum, and Alex who stayed at home. Alex is the party girl, Anna is the quiet one. Mom dies in a fire, and dad falls in love with Rachel, the beautiful blonde nurse half his age. Rachel turns into the evil step-mother, although she's really the live in step-mother. The story is great fodder for a horror movie.Fanboys of the original Korean film, I think the featurette 'Unlocking the Uninvited' addresses most of your issues with this film. I've never seen the film, probably will never see it. The Uninvited is loosely based on the Korean filmA Tale of Two Sisters (Two-Discs), and was heavily rewritten and redirected to appeal to more Western / American tastes. I would say, job very well done.The film itself is well done. The directors avoided computer generated special effects, and it shows. The film has a classic horror film feel. They managed to pace things rather well. The ominous music track got a bit old after a while, but then when the end comes around, well that music fits and makes sense. Camera work was always solid.I enjoyed the two sisters, Anna played by Emily Browning (Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (Widescreen Edition), the older sister Violet) was sweet and just the right amount of edgy. I almost hesitate to say this, but she reminds me very much of the Shannen Doherty that was a smart shy girl in the 1980's television series Our House. Arielle Kebble played Alex, as a 23 year old playing somebody much younger, she did an excellent job. Elizabeth Banks was a bit weaker in her role of Rachel the live in step-mother. She is a bit too white bread flat actress to bring on the real hating her, or her being the really evil step-mother. Elizabeth was good in her role as a doctor in the television series Scrubs. David Strathairn is perfect as the writer father, just enough class in his acting.The film is rated PG-13, probably one of those films where we should have PG-14 or 15 maybe. There are a fair number of mature references in here. A fairly long discussion about a vibrator - 'hey meet Mr. Chubby.' There are enough references that a child will ask. There were a few more scenes like that, nothing to make the movie R, but just adult enough that you might want to be sure the 13 year old is a good mature child. Definitely would not let anyone younger than 13 view this film. The horror is enough to give adults nightmares.The DVD has some nice features. The already mentioned 'Unlocking the Uninvited,' roughly 15 minutes. An alternate ending that is really bad - the ending chosen is excellent. And a few deleted scenes, that should remain deleted (they gave away too much of the ending).At an hour and a half, the film is just about the right length.I was scared. I'm not a huge horror film fan, I've watched many and liked very few. This one landed in the like it a lot category. I really liked the ending.

K,"[11, 16]","THE UNINVITED**** Out of 5Release Date- January 30th, 2009Running Time- 87-MinutesRating- PG-13Screenplay- Craig Rosenberg, Doug Miro & Carlo BernardDirector- Charles & Thomas GuardStarring- Emily Browning, Arielle Kebbel, David Strathairn and Elizabeth BanksIn many ways this decade is sort of the 80s in reverse; it seemed like back in the 80s every horror flick was a sequel and now it seems every horror flick is a remake. Both have the same basic idea and that's to cash in on the success of the original only with a remake it starts things over. Most of the recent remakes haven't been very good and others were alright; Dawn of the Dead was one of the few that were actually really good.  But remakes of Asian horror flicks always seem to turn out horrible or just below average. You have the downright pathetic One Missed Call and slightly below average The Grudge and The Eye, which was an average movie, but sadly was probably the best remake of an Asian horror flick. Well that was until The Uninvited, which was actually a pretty good movie.The Uninvited is a remake of the South Korean masterpiece A Tale of Two Sisters, which was written and directed by Ji-woon Kim. When I first heard of the remake I wasn't really too excited seeing as A Tale of Two Sisters is one of my all time favorite horror flicks and since the track record for Asian horror movies remade in the States have turned out awful my expectations were very low. The trailer looked fairly decent and so I decided to give it a chance. First up bottom line is The Uninvited is far inferior to A Tale of Two Sisters, but with that said I really liked The Uninvited. I feel there is always a different direction you can take a movie. That doesn't mean a different direction would be better, but there is more than one way to tell a story.The Uninvited takes the basic concept of A Tale of Two Sisters, but also goes in a slightly different direction therefore at least it's not a shot for shot remake, but doesn't stray to where it has nothing to do with the movie it's based on. Some of the different directions this movie took doesn't always work, but it remains interesting. Like the original version The Uninvited is a mixture of a drama and mystery with horror elements. Sometimes the mixture doesn't always work, but it worked brilliantly in A Tale of Two Sisters and while it doesn't work as well it still works in The Uninvited.The screenplay by Craig Rosenberg, Doug Miro & Carlo Bernard is surprisingly well written. The characters are well developed and actually interesting as well. Like the original the core of the story is about the two sisters and like the original the relationship between two works very well and feels real and not forced. Some of the new ideas like ghostly visions while not bad feels too much like your run of the mill ghost flick something A Tale of Two Sisters wasn't. But this new element does mostly work overall. The screenplay keeps the basic idea of the original, but has enough going for it to keep it from being a rehash. While the script isn't much deliver a by the books horror flick, but it still works even if clich&eacute;d. There is some decent suspense and tension and they handle the dramatic scenes well and deliver some decent suspense.Directors Charles & Thomas Guard never reach the epic heights Ji-woon Kim reached, but they still deliver a solid movie. Most of the big scare scenes are done pretty much the way it was done in the original so if you've seen that it won't work as well here. But the pacing is slow, but steady and the movie never fails to be interesting. Again The Guard Brothers may not reach the level of greatness Ji-woon Kim did, but they deliver a solid movie that turns out better than maybe it should have.I'd say the strongest aspect of The Uninvited were the actors; Elizabeth Banks is quickly becoming one of my favorite actresses and once again Banks delivers a great performance and it also doesn't hurt that she's very easy on the eyes. David Strathairn is slightly underused as the father torn between his daughters and girlfriend, but he delivers an excellent performance. But it's Emily Browning as Anna and Arielle Kebbel as Alex that really elevate The Uninvited.Browning and Kebbel really work amazing together and both deliver excellent performances; this was Arielle Kebbel's best performance to date and she's an actress with a lot of potential, but it's Emily Browning who is clearly the standout with an excellent and sympathetic performance. As long as she picks the right roles she can go far in her career. But again both Browning and Kebbel are excellent and really cute as well so that helps as well.Due to the fact we are in what seems remake hell sadly The Uninvited might get dismissed as yet another pointless remake of a truly amazing film and while I cannot argue that The Uninvited is a pointless remake it was actually really good and better than most of the recent remakes to come along. Don't let the PG-13 rating scare you off as a movie like this doesn't need an R-rating. Had this been R-rated it wouldn't have made the movie any better. The violence level is low, but there is a little bit of blood, but not much obviously. The Uninvited is a prime example how PG-13 doesn't have to mean bad.The twist in The Uninvited doesn't work as well as it did in the original, but it doesn't follow it exactly. It does offer its own twist on the twist and while it worked well it's s not as strong as A Tale of Two Sisters. Bottom line is The Uninvited isn't as good as the original movie it's based on, but with that said it was actually pretty good and hopefully other fans of A Tale of Two Sisters gives The Uninvited a fair shot.As for the Blu-ray release the picture quality is very sharp and looks excellent in HD and the sound is also solid as well, but the disc lacks with extras. There is an 18-min behind the scenes feature (watch it after the movie some spoilers) deleted scenes and an alternate ending. All the extras are also on the DVD, but the good thing is the features on the Blu-ray are all in HD. Sometimes the features are SD, but not here. I don't know if this movie is popular enough to warrant another edition, but you never know.",4,"Quite the suprise I actually liked it a lot, but not as good as the original",1240963200,"04 29,

1238097,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001U0HBQA,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 2]","Based on the popular Korean film `A Tale of Two Sisters', `the uninvited' is more of a tragic film not a horror film that ultimately rocks you with its shocking ending.VIDEO & AUDIO:""the uninvited"" features a very clean transfer as it sports a MPEG-4 AVC codec at 1080p (Aspect Ratio: 1:85:1).  The shots are primarily dark and low-level lighting and no artifacts or low-light noise were evident.  Outdoor scenes were vibrant in colors with blue skies, trees in the background.  Blacks are very good and no artifacting.  Overall, the picture quality was very good and you can see the detail of the talent's faces and surroundings.As for audio, the film features a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack.  Some scenes that are there to frighten, really come out quite strong from your front channels.  I didn't hear too much subwoofer usage or rear channel usage.  But for dialogue, dialogue was crystal clear, as was the music.  This film is not much of a horror film, so there were no major action, horror sequences.  If anything, there were short bursts of tense and frightening segments that were strong and really done well to frighten the viewer.SPECIAL FEATURES:This Blu-ray disc for ""the uninvited"" comes with three special features in high definition:* Unlocking the uninvited - Nearly twenty minutes long, this featurette goes about how the producers came across the Korean film and then purchasing the rights for the making of a new film for the English speaking audience.  Interviews with the directors, the Guard Brothers, the producers and also the talents of the film.  Emily Browning (with her Australian accent) and Elizabeth Banks talked about their first impressions of each other.  How the goal was to not be the same as the Korean film which was artistic but to come close in the final cut.  We also learn how difficult it was to find the home where the film would be shot and what alterations they were allowed to make in the home and for the alternations they couldn't make, they had to use less light in those scenes.* Deleted Scenes - About five minutes long and four deleted scenes.  The deleted scenes were not integral to the film but one does feature Anna and Alex discussing her dreams and how Anna didn't want her father to know or else they would think she's crazy and send her back to the mental hospital.* Alternate Ending - About a minute long, for this alternate ending, let's just say that I'm glad they didn't use it in the final cut.JUDGMENT CALL:First, I must say that ""the uninvited"" is not a horror film, it's a tragic film with a few horror elements.For anyone expecting a horror film, they are not going to get anything anywhere near what is shown in theaters today.  If anything, the film is actually clever, creepy and enjoyed how the film was building up to this shocking ending which I admit, I was not expecting.It was great to see Emily Browning as the main character of Anna, now slightly older since her appearance as the young Violet from the 2004 film ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"".  Her portrayal of a teenage girl who is haunted by these dreams and images makes you care for her character and thus makes the ending quite surprising for the viewer. I was amazed to hear her talk with a strong Australian accent during  the special featurette and then turning the accent off for her character.  All in all, she did a good job.Arielle Kebbel who plays Alex did a good job and its another horror film for the young actress since ""The Grudge 2'.  David Straithairn as the father Steven is a well-known actor who has been on many films (""The Bourne Ultimatum"", ""Fracture"", ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"", etc.) and plays a father who cares for his daughter but at the same time, conflicted when his daughter tries to hurt his relationship with Rachel.  And Elizabeth Banks (""Zack and Miri Makes a Porno"", ""W"", ""Spider-Man"" films) who has come off a string of theatrical hits plays the nurse and fiance of Steven.  Playing a character of mystery until we reach the unraveling of the film at the end.Overall, ""the uninvited"" was an entertaining film.  Like any Asian horror film that is being remade in the US, remakes tend to make people who are familiar with the original film, tend to give the automatic thumbs down.Having watched a good number of these horror films from Japan and Korea, I never expect to see an exact replication for the English adaption and I just take it for what it is.  And ""the uninvited"" is a tragic film with a few moments of creepiness but it's the ending that I felt was quite clever and gave the film that extra creepiness.Anyone expecting horror/slash elements will probably be disappointed because the film doesn't strongly go in that direction.  But as much as I found ""the uninvited"" entertaining, I still recommend everyone to watch the original Korean film ""A Tale of Two Sisters"".As for the Blu-ray, picture quality and audio quality were pretty good.  It's just that the special features were a bit on the small side and the film was short and average at best.Otherwise, if you are a fan of any of the talents in the film or want an entertaining, creepy popcorn flick to have in your collection that is not gory or overly bloody and sadistic, ""the uninvited"" may be worth it for you to check out and possibly adding to your Blu-ray collection.",3,A tragic film not a horror film that ultimately rocks you with its shocking ending.,1240876800,"04 28, 2009",2009,5336,"['Based', 'popular', 'Korean', 'film', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters',

As I recall, it was a simply terrible film that wasn't very scary, was frankly boring, had actors that deserve MUCH better than this, but oh, that ending. I still remember the ending. Looking back on it, the ending actually helped the movie since I still remember it. This movie should by no means taken seriously, so I will not write this review seriously, instead, I shall try to remember all I can about it without looking it up online.Alright, so the main girl comes home to her lake-side house to live with her father after a stay at a mental institution, where she was coping with her mother's death. Her sister is there, and her father, played by the great David Strathairn, who has a new girlfriend in the form of Elizabeth Banks. Elizabeth Banks is playing the role of the evil step-mother here. The main girl thinks Banks is only there to still her father's money, and then kill him, but why she is so evil to the main girl. The main girl also finds out that Banks might have been a babysitter that killed a few kids or something, and the main girl is also haunted by the ghosts of the kids, and the kids pop out as ghosts and provide the ""scary"" moments.In the end, the main girl and her sister are almost killed by Banks and then... My mind gets fuzzy. I'm sure it wasn't important. Point is, the main girl was actually batcrap crazy the whole time, and imagined most all the proceeding events. Her sister is actually dead and died in a house fire that killed the original mother, and it was all started by the main girl accidentally, which made her insane. Thus, Elizabeth Banks was actually a nice person the whole time and was not evil. There's something to explain away the ghosts or something, and the main girl actually kills Elizabeth Banks in real life, rendering her ultra batcrap crap crazy, and poor David Stathairn is left without his girl friend, and an insane daughter that has basically killed (accidentally of course) his entire family. Let's see if I was right (Hold on while I look up the plot to gauge my accuracy)...Alright, so it was even more crazy than I originally remember. Wikipedia has the full plot details here: [...]Point is, if you watch this movie, you'll be mildly entertained, but not in a good way. This is a stupid, stupid movie that's as crazy as its main character and is not really recommendable to anyone, unless reading the plot synopsis really interests you.Note: I wouldn't mind Elizabeth Banks trying to kill me.

1238115,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B001U0HBQA,JGC,"[3, 3]","I just watched ""The Uninvited"" for the first time and I really enjoyed it. It's sort of like 3 movies in one because it is layered with a lot of depth and character development. It's like looking at an intricate picture; each time you stare at it the picture looks different because you're watching it from a different angle.Emily Browning played Anna impeccably. She totally captured all of the emotion, terror and fear that this young girl was experiencing throughout the entire movie. Elizabeth Banks, playing Rachael (the resident home wrecker) was also wonderful to watch because some of her lines and mannerisms were so outrageous and over-the-top (I loved the part when they had the fancy dinner engagement  and she went off in the kitchen).Some have described ""The Uninvited"" as a ""horror"" movie. As someone that has seen my fair share of horror I don't know how much it would fit into that category. The movie is certainly creepy, and very suspenseful and eventful, which had a lot to do with Emily Browning's character and Arielle Kebbel (as her sister Alex) who was also fantastic.When I first watched this movie I didn't hate the Rachael character as much as I hated the father (David Strathairn). He just seemed so out of touch with his daughters and their own needs and was only thinking of himself. And perhaps to make the story flow a little more seamless the father was often missing in action which allowed the girls and Rachael to take over the burden of rounding out and shaping the plot. But after I watched this movie again I had a much different perspective, he seemed much more multifaceted and dimensional than I had first thought him to be.""The Uninvited"" is currently in rotation on Home Box so if you have a chance to watch it I certainly recommend it. I did take off 1 star simply because the beginning was rather slow-moving, but it sure picks up a lot of momentum.Watching ""The Uninvited"" will remind you of that old proverbial reference: when the cat's away the mice will play.

But before long, I had could see that the writer and director were either remaking the earlier film, or stealing the best images from it.  Upon reading through the end titles, I saw 'Based on . . .' and I felt vindicated.I'm a huge fan of J and K-Horror, and A Tale of Two Sisters was one of the first ones I purchased.  It's a very good film- maybe not the classic some people say it is, but very good nonetheless.And usually, American remakes are less-than-stellar in my opinion.However, I really liked what they did with this film.  They captured the essence of the original, without trying to make it a carbon copy or worse, going in a completly different direction.  It's a fine balancing act, and I feel they pulled it off nicely.There are certain points that bothered me, such as the two sisters piecing together the 'true' identity of their new step-mother.  Or the dream sequence stuff . . .That's the difference between Asian Horror and Western Horror: Hollywood feels compelled to burden us with grounded logic.  Why do we have to know the history of the step-mother, or the possible connection to a previous murder scenario?  Why couldn't the step-mother just be a loathesome individual, like in the original?And the dream sequences . . . It seems that scary stuff can ONLY happen in dream sequences, according to Hollywood.  Of course, the girl then wakes up and things are fine . . . OR ARE THEY?  MWAHAHA.In the original, everything was simply nightmare reality.  There was no waking up from it.  To me, that's a much scarier scenario, where the writer and director aren't hamstrung by logic . . .Oops.

I was having that deja vu feeling of having been there before, the incredibly lush and tall trees, the rocky craggy beach, the formidable cliffs and the stormy sea.  It all looked like Harpers Island, the thriller series from CBS that we enjoyed so much last year.  In a way, THE UNINVITED is a lot like Harpers Island, only not as scary, but they share a predilection for a good grabber twist.  Suffice it to say that we stayed for the credits and noticed that the movie was filmed on Bowen's Island in British Columbia, indeed the exact same location that Harpers Island was filmed at.  Good spotting!SPOILERS AHEAD.I want to know what kind of direction do they give a character like Elizabeth Banks plays here?  My observations extend not only to Rachel, the nurse played by Banks, but to all similar characters in similar plots.  ""Director, what's my motivation?""  ""Well, we want you to look evil and forbidding, even though it will turn out that you are completely innocent.""  ""How do I do that?""  ""I don't know, maybe freeze up your face as though you'd just swallowed a tube of botox, and glare through your eyes as though squinting in the sun.""  I have to give Banks credit for playing a difficult part, though I think she was cheating as we saw the movie again, she definitely seemed to be trying to portray a ruthless ""angel of mercy"" type serial killer nurse, and that got me to thinking, maybe they gave her a different script than the other actors got, one in which she was definitely the killer.THE UNINVITED was a movie so dull, in which nothing happens really, that it makes you immediately suspect all this chazzerai is only the setup to a twist ending.

However, when I watched the DVD, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I liked it. First off, this isn't a horror film per se. While it does use some horror elements and seems to have been marketed as a horror film, it really isn't. In the special features section, I believe one of the directors describes the movie as ""a tragedy disguised as a horror film"" or words to that effect. I think that describes it rather accurately.While I can see why some people may have found the plot predictable, I think the casting of Emily Browning as the main character balances that out. Even when you find out what kind of person she is at the film's end, you still don't want to believe it.And I think that it's good the film didn't heavily concentrate on special effects to scare people.

There's a good amount of gloomy atmosphere to find in The Uninvited, and even some twists as well, but none of which that amounts to a whole lot compared to what's found in A Tale of Two Sisters, which is far, far superior in terms of shocks and a dynamite ending.  The scares here are predictable and, well, unscary to say the least, and it's hard to decide who comes off as creepier, Browning or Banks.  Other than having Arielle Kebbel in a bikini, there isn't a whole lot to really recommend The Uninvited.

Unfortunately, this is the one time where Strathairn's judgment seems to have been off. Hugely off.I won't go into the details of plot, because if you've seen any horror film in the last 25 years (especially The Sixth Sense) you've already seen everything this remake of a Korean movie has to offer done better...and in far superior pictures.Saddled with over the top, one-note performances, this movie is undone early enough by casting of Emily Browning, a lead actress who seems far too young for the role she is playing, and one also woefully unprepared to bring any depth to the role. Arielle Kebbel is only marginally better, at least she is age appropriate for the role, though the character is about as cardboard cutout as you can get. But hands down, Elizabeth Banks as the ""evil"" Rachel Summers is so far over the top that you expect her to do the Dr. Evil pinky to the mouth maneuver about 30 minutes in.

Unlike every other devotee of Asian horror films I know, I was pretty unimpressed with A Tale of Two Sisters (viz. 2-6-2006 issue, and I've actually since revised my rating down to 3 stars) given its sterling reputation. An amusing side note, though: I did find it interesting that the Guard Brothers, instead of keeping the original title, switched it out for one used by another Korean film released the same year, directed by Su-yeon Lee, a paranormal mystery that is in every way superior to A Tale of Two Sisters (in fact, it was rather high on my list of the best films of the decade). This film, a pretty straight remake of A Tale of Two Sisters, has nothing at all to do with Lee's Korean film of that name. More's the pity.Bros.Guard, in their first feature-length outing, introduce us to Anna Rydell (A Series of Unfortunate Events' Emily Browning), who as we open is in a mental institution, about to be released. Her shrink (TV character actor Dean Paul Gibson) believes she can get no better while still there, and needs to go home and heal with her family, or what's left of it. There's her father, Steven (L. A. Confidential's David Strathairn), and her sister, Alex (The Grudge 2's Arielle Kebbel). There's also her late mother's nurse, Rachel (The 40 Year Old Virgin's Elizabeth Banks), who's now romantically involved with dad. Anna and Alex are not at all happy with this turn of events, and after poking around, come to believe that Rachel may not be who she says she is. The problem, of course, is convincing dad that Rachel may be after more than fun times...My friend Mariel posited that this movie exists solely to showcase Emily Browning in her underwear. I'm not going to argue with that, mostly because I'm too distracted by Emily Browning in her underwear. I'm also willing to, at least on the surface, give Guard 1 and Guard 2 props for some of the trickier stuff they pulled off successfully here. Problem is, none of it's really original. (It wasn't original in the original film; either; the Big Reveal montage is nicely done, but was a great deal subtler in another, earlier film whose name I can't tell you, because it would blow the twist entirely.) Which leaves us with a movie that's all style and no substance, but I don't think of it as sacrilegious, as so many others do. Like the similarly capable Shutter remake, this movie simply struck me as being unnecessary, rather than being bad. (That said, I also cannot comprehend people who refuse to watch movies with subtitles; I'm sure they find this film necessary in the extreme, if they're curious about the original.) Thus, I'll put forth the following: let how you felt about the original be your guide here. If you thought it was the cat's pyjamas, you're probably going to hate this. On the other hand, if you could take or leave that one, this one won't offend you. Which sounds like a lose-lose proposition, so the kicker is how you feel about the idea of Emily Browning in her underwear. For me, that's a win. ** ",3,"Unnecessary, but not awful.",1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,3241,"['Uninvited', 'Charles', 'Thomas', 'Guard', '2009', 'am', 'coming', 'Uninvited', 'what', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'unique', 'situation', 'realize', 'film', 'remake', 'Korean', 'smash', 'hit', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'much', 'care', 'other', 'devotee', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', 'know', 'was', 'pretty', 'unimpressed', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'viz', '2-6-2006', 'issue', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'revised', 'rating', 'down', '3', 'stars', 'given', 'sterling', 'reputation', 'amusing', 'side', 'note', 'did', 'find', 'interesting', 'Guard', 'Brothers', 'instead', 'keeping', 'original', 'title', 'switched', 'out', 'one', 'used', 'Korean', 'film', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'directed', 'Su-yeon', 'Lee', 'paranormal', 'mystery', 'way', 'superior', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'fact', 'was', 'rather', 'high', 'list', 'best', 'films', 'decade', 'film', 'pretty', 'straight', 'remake', 'A', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'nothing', 'do', 'Lee', 'Korean', 'film', 'name', 'More', 'pity.Bros.Guard', 'first', 'feature-length', 'outing', 'introduce', 'Anna', 'Rydell', 'A', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'who', 'open', 'mental', 'institution', 'be', 'released', 'shrink', 'TV', 'character', 'actor', 'Dean', 'Paul', 'Gibson', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'still', 'go', 'home', 'heal', 'family', 'what', 'left', 'father', 'Steven', 'L.', 'A', 'Confidential', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'sister', 'Alex', 'Grudge', '2', 'Arielle', 'Kebbel', 'also', 'late', 'mother', 'nurse', 'Rachel', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'who', 'now', 'romantically', 'involved', 'dad', 'Anna', 'Alex', 'are', 'not', 'happy', 'turn', 'events', 'poking', 'around', 'come', 'believe', 'Rachel', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'who', 'problem', 'course', 'convincing', 'dad', 'Rachel', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'fun', 'times', 'friend', 'Mariel', 'posited', 'movie', 'solely', 'showcase', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'underwear', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'argue', 'mostly', ""'m"", 'too', 'distracted', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'underwear', ""'m"", 'also', 'willing', 'least', 'surface', 'give', 'Guard', '1', 'Guard', '2', 'props', 'trickier', 'stuff', 'pulled', 'off', 'successfully', 'here', 'Problem', 'none', 'really', 'original', 'was', ""n't"", 'original', 'original', 'film', 'Big', 'Reveal', 'montage', 'nicely', 'done', 'was', 'great', 'deal', 'subtler', 'earlier', 'film', 'name', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'would', 'blow', 'twist', 'entirely', 'movie', 'style', 'substance', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'sacrilegious', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'do', 'similarly', 'capable', 'Shutter', 'remake', 'movie', 'simply', 'struck', 'being', 'unnecessary', 'rather', 'being', 'bad', 'said', 'also', 'can', 'not', 'comprehend', 'people', 'who', 'refuse', 'watch', 'movies', 'subtitles', ""'m"", 'sure', 'find', 'film', 'necessary', 'extreme', ""'re"", 'curious', 'original', 'Thus', ""'ll"", 'put', 'forth', 'following', 'let', 'how', 'felt', 'original', 'be', 'guide', 'here', 'thought', 'was', 'cat', 'pyjamas', ""'re"", 'probably', 'going', 'hate', 'other', 'hand', 'could', 'take', 'leave', 'one', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'offend', 'Which', 'lose-lose', 'proposition', 'kicker', 'how', 'feel', 'idea', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'underwear', 'win', '**']",N/A

His love interest is the nurse (Elizabeth Banks) hired to care for Anna's now deceased mother.Anna joins forces with her sister Alex (Arielle Kebbel) to try and dislodge the nurse. As they ask more questions about the fire that claimed their mother's life, the girls become convinced that the nurse is not who she says she is. But proving this to their father seems impossible, for he regards them warily and seems to believe everything he hears from their stepmother-to-be.The Uninvited is a remake of the Korean horror film Janghwa, Hongryeon (released here as A Tale of Two Sisters) directed and written by Kim Ji-woon. The original was only released in 2003, and is superior in every way to the Hollywood version. In fact, the Korean version is so beautiful and the English language adaptation is so awful, the comparison calls for an accompanying rant on the very practice of adapting recent foreign hits for American audiences.It's great to see artists of the caliber of Kim Ji-woon being paid for the rights to their work. If only the people buying those rights would honor what they buy. What is the point of remaking a film with a devoted following, and distorting or throwing out every element that excited fans and critics about that work? Wouldn't it be better to have a U.S. distributor re-market the original with the aim of making it more popular? It seems to me that the expectation of American audiences is dismally low in Hollywood. Or is it pure xenophobia that makes the majority of our film producers believe anything good still ought to be re-titled, re-focused, and given a Western cast?Leaving the general social attitude and getting back to The Uninvited, the problem with adaptation is demonstrated perfectly in the DVD extras. There the film's directors and producers talk about why they were drawn to the project. The directors praise their favorite Korean horror films for their emotion and ambiguity. The producers also note the ambiguity of the original, and then go on to explain how they and the writers systematically did away with that ambiguity, because it was confusing and made the story ""hard to follow.""In other words, they were not bright enough to understand or interpret the original to their satisfaction, so they made it simpler and more stupid, for the rest of us.

1238157,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B001U0HBQA,Terry Mesnard,"[48, 58]","The Uninvited begins with our protagonist, Anna, in a mental ward after dealing with the emotional trauma of losing her mother in a freak fire. As the film begins, her psychiatrist believes she is ready to go back into the real world and she is allowed to move back in with her father and her older sister, Alex. Unfortunately, father is now seeing Rachel, a nurse who was in charge of Anna's mother. This weird situation is further complicated by the fact that Anna is becoming more and more convinced that her mom wasn't killed in a freak accident...maybe she was murdered.So if you have watched ghost movies over the last ten or so years, you basically know this film. It hits all of the major plot points, has a couple requisite twists and throws weird scares at you (it is based on a Korean film, you know). I expected all of this. I even expected one twist that I thought was revealed very early on. Even so, the ending still surprised me and I have to say that this film was classy in telling a familiar story. The truth is, there hasn't really been a genre-changing film in the ghost story genre for awhile now. The Uninvited is no different. So, what is important is not what is being told (as there's nothing new under the sun), but how it's told.Here The Uninvited soars where a lot of recent ghost stories (Unborn, for example) have failed. The storytelling is far classier than it has any right to be, the script is well-written and convincing and the actors are terrific. Emily Browning, playing Anna, practically carries the weight of the film on her slender shoulders. With her forlorn and innocent gaze, you really start to feel for her increasingly desperate plight. Meanwhile, her sister is played perfectly by Arielle Kebbel who brings a sexy older sibling charm to the proceedings. And then there's Elizabeth Banks, playing the stepmother who might not be all she says she is.All of this is pitted against a murder mystery or two and wrapped up in a perfect bow. There's not a dull moment in the film, the scares actually startled me, even when I expected them and some of the ghostly hauntings could give the weird factor of The Grudge/Ring a run for their money. It's effective and very well done.I definitely recommend going to see it. The Korean film, A Tale of Two Sisters, is definitely in my scope now, to see how it stacks up.

The woman that was supposed to watch over the matriarch of the family is now in the arms of the father, and the daughter coming home finds this disturbing. Worse still is the mystery of the night itself - what happened, how it happened, who caused it - there seem to be a thousand questions spinning like a loom in her mind. This leads her to question everything and everyone, and to wonder why she keeps seeing her dead mother, looking at her and pointing out the window to the tune of one word: ""murderer.""The first time I watched The Uninvited, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit. There are twists and turns that are unexpected, people that seem like horrid only to be victims, and terrible calamities that await anyone caught in this unexpected maelstrom. The dead are not quite in this movie, either, making their presence known as they piece together things that a broken memory does not contain. Still, things are not what they seem and, at the end of the movie, the tune sung is not what I expected. I liked that - being surprised for a change - because most movies are easy to figure out. This one can be figure out if a person sets out to do it as well, but the horrific camouflage that hides the plot is thick enough to keep one from guessing the true ending.Another great thing about this movie is the first time you watch it with all the answers in your pocket. This casts a strange light on everything and shows you just how much your implied sensibilities make you guess at the answers you think you have. In truth, I enjoyed doing this more than anything, and I say this because it shows the characters without the smokescreen they throw up. This makes for an interesting showing, not better than the movie the first time around but great nonetheless, and made me happy that  had the chance to scan the show once more.If you like your horror creepy, then you'll enjoy this. It has some terrible parts inside the storyline, with bodies snapping to stand and terrors limping across the floor to make contact with our main character. In some places I actually felt for her, and this made me all-the-more happy when I watched it on the second go. If you are thinking, ""I should skip this because it's a modern movie,"" then you would also be wrong. It appeals to a range of people that enjoy movies both new and old, and even took me - an old school horror junkie - for a nice little ride. While it has its points of horror it is also a psychological tale, and the feeling that you get at first, thinking you have the answers, is a deceptive one. I recommend at least watching it twice, just to get the feel of knowing and then not really knowing, just to show you how well the actors did in their roles.

1238167,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001U0HBQA,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[1, 2]","Produced by remake king Roy Lee and directed by Charles and Thomas Guard, ""The Uninvited"" is a remake of Kim Ji-Woon's South Korean blockbuster hit ""A Tale of Two Sisters"". Well, actually this film is more of a re-imagining of the Korean horror film; it does have the original's main concept, throws in a few iconic sequences from the original, but has an entirely different premise. Let's get right to the point, ""The Uninvited"" is VASTLY inferior to its South Korean counterpart, but would provoke curiosity from the original's fans (as I am).Released from a mental institution after a suicide attempt, Anna (Emily Browning) hopes for a happy reunion with her sister, Alex (hottie Arielle Kebbel, John Tucker Must Die) and their father Stephen (David Strathairn). She finds that her dad is currently making whoopee with their deceased mom's former nurse, Rachel (sexy Elizabeth Banks, Slither) and this relationship may indeed stand in the way of her family's happiness.I loved the Korean original and that would be my standpoint in this review. I will try to stick along the reins of this film, since this film is no comparison. ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" had certain thought-provoking elements and gave a very mind-bending cinematic experience. The original was meticulously executed, brilliant and is ANYTHING but conventional. This ""Americanization"" is your basic Hollywood offering, very routine and offers little surprises. I do have to give some credit to the directors since it avoided another shot-for-shot remake, too bad the end result is a little dry. No wonder that American Horror has fallen in popularity the past few years. It takes a supreme effort for me to even remember a real great serving of Hollywood horror.The screenplay in this film is a little too routine and telegraphs its punches too soon even for those who never saw the original. The clues to the mystery were very obvious especially to the experienced movie watcher. Thrills and scares will always have to contain emotions, the viewer has to form even the smallest amount of attachment so the characters would feel real and a script can grab its audience. ""The Uninvited"" tries but falters, its build ups to its suspenseful moments feel uninspired and its dialogue a little sour. The film does try to become a ""crisis of conscience"" emotional struggle in a way, and mixes in a few supernatural elements along the way; the problem is, it just couldn't achieve an engagement to its plot.The puzzle pieces were very predictable and was uninspired. It fumbles through its exposition of its mystery with very obvious clues that even a teenager can spot. It was fairly obvious that the direction was struggling a little midway through the film, the Brothers Guard kept relying on the usual conventions of Asian horror such as creepy ghost children, mild ghoulish images, a mystery and the critical ingredient; a surprise twist in the climax. I guess the plot did set its groundwork which is why I didn't hate the film, but it was very routine. The usual plot mechanics are omnipresent in the film.Elizabeth Banks is one very attractive lady, she is quite distracting to look at. Banks is a decent actress, but she was burdened by the script to maintain a creepy, intense presence that she was almost reduced to a cheap villainess. Emily Browning did the best she could given the limitations of the screenplay, but even divine intervention couldn't save the film. Browning is a talented actress, and the poor girl is just lost in the limitations of the script. Arielle Kebbel makes for good eye candy and I tolerated her somewhat unconvincing portrayal, but I feel that she failed to form a unique kind of chemistry with Browning as with their Korean original counterparts.Although a bit disappointing, ""The Uninvited"" is still decent compared to other servings of Asian Horror remakes. This is a masterpiece compared to the remakes of ""Shutter"" and ""One Missed Call"". It suffers quite a bit with its lack of suspense and its attempts to generate tension proved very lackluster. One redeeming quality is its twist at the climax, it wasn't as brilliant as the one in the original, but at least it set its groundwork so it didn't feel like a throw-away detail. Unfortunately the journey between its beginning and its last act does feel very dull. It just played its aces too soon that it all felt rudimentary. I wouldn't really advise to see this film unless you're very curious as to how the magnificent ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" get ""Americanized"".RENT IT.
