1422903,A9Y947FCJZPVL,B004OBQDCK,Arcadio Bolaos,"[7, 11]","Gregg Araki's films share a special signature. As a filmmaker, his interest towards certain themes are aptly exploited in different and peculiar ways. InMysterious Skin (Deluxe Unrated Director's Edition)we witness the alien abduction fantasy embraced by one of the protagonists, inNowherean alien invasion serves both as a metaphor and as in incursion into the real. In Kaboom, Araki plays again with that which surpasses normal humanity, redefining it in the process.We find ourselves immersed in a story about college, young men and women, mysterious murders, secret societies and conspiracy theories that, somehow, mingle together with a surreal sensitivity. The first scene takes us to Smith's mind, an 18-year-old student... or, more exactly, to a dream he has been having frequently. After that he starts masturbating while fantasizing with his roommate Thor, a blonde surfer with perfect abs. Smith, however, doesn't want to be labeled... he considers himself neither gay nor bisexual. He has indeed sexual encounters with boys and girls, but his best friend Stella is convinced that he leans more towards guys. Stella is a lesbian that finds conflict in a risky relationship with a girl that has, to put it mildly, supernatural abilities.At the same time, Smith finds out that a girl from college, one that appears in his dreams, has been murdered by men in black disguised with animal masks. Except he cannot be sure if he's imagining things because of the hallucinogen drugs he takes or simply because he's becoming paranoid and losing his mind in the process. It's college and there are drugs and alcohol everywhere; here actually one of Araki's favorite actors, James Duval, interprets the typical school ""stoner"", who pretty much sums up Stella's assertion: ""college is just an intermission between high school and the rest of your life. Four years of having sex, making stupid mistakes and experiencing stuff"".When Stella has sex with her girlfriend there is a special luminosity that announces a supernatural element... and when Smith agrees to engage in sexual intercourse with a lighthearted girl named London he also experiences a weird luminescence which he attributes to drugs. In the same way he cannot define himself as homosexual or bisexual, he is also constantly escaping out of normal consciousness, which is made clear with the dream at the beginning of the film. Psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan would correlate the privileged mode in which we capture our own selves through narcissistic investment with the type of knowledge based on the 'illusion of consciousness' in which it is implied that the entire reality could become accessible to the mind, turned inside-out, and as a result, it could be illuminated and made transparent. Kaboom deals closely with this illusion of consciousness; it explores the mindset of Smith taking him constantly to different extremes of realities.This illusion, however, is insufficient if Smith is to find his place in the world, and he experiences its limitation when he confronts the phenomenon of the strange -with all its connotations, the stranger, the alien, the unfamiliar- here exemplified by the animal mask men that start chasing him; it doesn't matter if they are after him or if he's only imagining it, but the important thing is that he experiences fear (and thanks to the director's skills, we also experience the suspense of the persecutions); this seriously puts into question the very possibility of auto-transparency or auto-knowledge for Smith.Perhaps this is all linked with Smith's lack of a parental figure, as Lacanian theory would tell us it is the nom de pere or name of the father that inscribes the subject into the symbolic order. Smith has a loving mother, but he has never met his father who was conveniently reported dead in a car accident just before he was born. Without the name of the father, without the castration which takes place when the father removes any possibility of the mother having the phallus, it's clear that the individual, in this case Smith, would always be out of place or at least displaced from society. In a world ruled by heterosexual normativity, Smith has no clear space or location, and in the same way sexuality means for him to wander around aimlessly, he also starts slipping into an uncomfortable fissure that brings forth elements of reality and also from his personal oneiric world.I think no other director could have pulled this off. Kaboom succeeds in forcing us, the viewers, to reevaluate what we think, to defy established knowledge. When Smith finds out the truth behind the murders and the truth behind his father's death, he will no longer be able to see the world as he used to. But then again doesn't the same thing happen to us, as we grow up?",4,Defining sexuality: heterosexual or homosexual?,1317772800,"10 5, 2011",2011,4781,"['Gregg', 'Araki', 'films', 'share', 'special', 'signature', 'filmmaker', 'interest', 'towards', 'certain', 'themes', 'are', 'aptly', 'exploited', 'different', 'peculiar', 'ways', 'InMysterious', 'Skin', 'Deluxe', 'Unrated', 'Director', 'Edition', 'witness', 'alien', 'abduction', 'fantasy', 'embraced', 'one', 'protagonists', 'inNowherean', 'alien', 'invasion', 'metaphor', 'incursion', 'real', 'Kaboom', 'Araki', 'again', 'normal', 'humanity', 'redefining', 'process.We', 'find', 'immersed', 'story', 'college', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'mysterious', 'murders', 'secret', 'societies', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'somehow', 'together', 'surreal', 'sensitivity', 'first', 'scene', 'Smith', 'mind', '18-year-old', 'student', 'more', 'exactly', 'dream', 'been', 'having', 'frequently', 'masturbating', 'fantasizing', 'roommate', 'Thor', 'blonde', 'surfer', 'perfect', 'abs', 'Smith', 'however', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'labeled', 'gay', 'bisexual', 'indeed', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'boys', 'girls', 'best', 'friend', 'Stella', 'convinced', 'more', 'towards', 'guys', 'Stella', 'lesbian', 'conflict', 'risky', 'relationship', 'girl', 'put', 'mildly', 'supernatural', 'same', 'time', 'Smith', 'out', 'girl', 'college', 'one', 'dreams', 'been', 'murdered', 'men', 'black', 'disguised', 'animal', 'masks', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'sure', 'imagining', 'things', 'hallucinogen', 'drugs', 'simply', 'becoming', 'paranoid', 'losing', 'mind', 'process', 'college', 'are', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'everywhere', 'here', 'actually', 'one', 'Araki', 'favorite', 'actors', 'James', 'Duval', 'typical', 'school', 'stoner', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'Stella', 'assertion', 'college', 'just', 'intermission', 'high', 'school', 'rest', 'life', 'Four', 'years', 'having', 'sex', 'making', 'stupid', 'mistakes', 'experiencing', 'stuff', '.When', 'Stella', 'sex', 'girlfriend', 'special', 'luminosity', 'supernatural', 'element', 'when', 'Smith', 'engage', 'sexual', 'intercourse', 'lighthearted', 'girl', 'named', 'London', 'also', 'weird', 'luminescence', 'drugs', 'same', 'way', 'can', 'not', 'define', 'homosexual', 'bisexual', 'also', 'constantly', 'escaping', 'normal', 'consciousness', 'made', 'clear', 'dream', 'beginning', 'film', 'Psychoanalyst', 'Jacques', 'Lacan', 'would', 'correlate', 'privileged', 'mode', 'capture', 'own', 'selves', 'narcissistic', 'investment', 'type', 'knowledge', 'based', ""'illusion"", 'consciousness', 'implied', 'entire', 'reality', 'could', 'become', 'accessible', 'mind', 'turned', 'inside-out', 'result', 'could', 'be', 'illuminated', 'made', 'transparent', 'Kaboom', 'closely', 'illusion', 'consciousness', 'mindset', 'Smith', 'taking', 'constantly', 'different', 'extremes', 'realities.This', 'illusion', 'however', 'insufficient', 'Smith', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'limitation', 'when', 'phenomenon', 'strange', '-with', 'connotations', 'stranger', 'alien', 'unfamiliar-', 'here', 'exemplified', 'animal', 'mask', 'men', 'start', 'chasing', ""n't"", 'matter', 'are', 'only', 'imagining', 'important', 'thing', 'fear', 'thanks', 'director', 'skills', 'also', 'experience', 'suspense', 'persecutions', 'seriously', 'question', 'very', 'possibility', 'auto-transparency', 'auto-knowledge', 'Smith.Perhaps', 'linked', 'Smith', 'lack', 'parental', 'figure', 'Lacanian', 'theory', 'would', 'tell', 'nom', 'pere', 'name', 'father', 'subject', 'symbolic', 'order', 'Smith', 'loving', 'mother', 'never', 'met', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'conveniently', 'reported', 'dead', 'car', 'accident', 'just', 'was', 'born', 'name', 'father', 'castration', 'place', 'when', 'father', 'possibility', 'mother', 'having', 'phallus', 'clear', 'individual', 'case', 'Smith', 'would', 'always', 'be', 'place', 'least', 'displaced', 'society', 'world', 'ruled', 'heterosexual', 'normativity', 'Smith', 'clear', 'space', 'location', 'same', 'way', 'sexuality', 'wander', 'around', 'aimlessly', 'also', 'slipping', 'uncomfortable', 'fissure', 'forth', 'elements', 'reality', 'also', 'personal', 'oneiric', 'world.I', 'think', 'other', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'Kaboom', 'forcing', 'viewers', 'reevaluate', 'what', 'think', 'defy', 'established', 'knowledge', 'When', 'Smith', 'out', 'truth', 'murders', 'truth', 'father', 'death', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'world', 'used', 'then', 'again', ""n't"", 'same', 'thing', 'happen', 'grow', 'up']",N/A
1422904,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004OBQDCK,B. E Jackson,"[2, 8]","I seriously hope nobody watches this...The first half of Kaboom deals with nothing but a few college kids being open and experimenting with their sexuality.  That's it.  Besides the occasional funny and immature sarcasm, there's *nothing* else of value.The film consists of two main characters (a boy who likes other boys sexually, and a bad-tempered girl who likes other girls sexually).  They are both best friends, and don't have a problem being open with each other concerning their encounters with the sexual partners of their choosing, so expect to see the two of them constantly in their dorm rooms and sharing openly exactly what is on their mind.Pretty soon, more characters come into the picture and now it's focused entirely on boys and girls having sex with each other.  See what I mean?  There's really no reason whatsoever to watch such a crappy movie.  But wait!  There *is* a reason!After those atrocious 45 minutes of nothingness are over with, the storyline becomes funny.  Why?  Because it turns out the girlfriend of the girl is a psychotic freak with mental issues.  This character is portrayed as humorous though because she tortures the girl in a way that would be more appropriate for an *extremely* low budget horror flick mixed with comedy.What about the boy you ask?  Well, he's busy spending time on the beach searching for men to sleep with.  He's not as funny or as interesting as his female friend.Once that portion of the film is finally over with (and hey, if you've made it this far, you must either be really bored or really in high hopes that something good is coming, and you'd be right) the movie actually tries to tell a story about this mysterious cult that hides their identity by wearing animal masks.  They come out at night and torture people at the college.The ending was terrible beyond belief (concerning the cult) but I suppose it's supposed to be that way.  After all, when you spend half of the time telling no story whatsoever, why bother wrapping up the events in a satisfying and conclusive manner?  I'll leave you with a question.  For those who've played that old video game Mortal Kombat 3.  What's the biggest fatality in the game?  It's the same thing as the ending to this movie.

It is in Haley that Smith confides about his disturbing dreams, which later appears to have a connection to a mysterious cult operating on campus, which has already caused the death of at least one student.Like most Greg Araki films, this one is hard to describe or classify.  It is equal parts a light romantic comedy, satire pointing out the fluid nature of sexuality,  murder mystery and story about an international conspiracy.  The story is intentionally funny in parts, unintentionally laughable in others, and frightening at the same time. Acting is capable, the special effects reflect the tiny budget of the film, and some of the scene changes don't flow together very well.  Overall, it can be an enjoyable diversion for those who don't take their movies too seriously, with a reminder that people are not always what they seem to be.Not rated, but would be an R for partial nudity and simulated sex.

Paganism also, and an unscary witch?  Supposed to be funny? Hope it's not supposed to be scary because that pretty much fails. The world ends in a big rapture/ symbolic orgasm? New Order/ Joy Division references? The sexual aspects that the director tries to explore are more successful than the rest of the movie which feels more like something a young film student would make....hmmm, like the character Smith. Maybe the movie is supposed to represent the bad movie that Smith would film. Movie of a dream of a film school student movie, about orgasms or something.What was the deal with the ugly messed up redhead, is she Mary Magdalene?

1422908,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004OBQDCK,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","Gregg Araki continues his daring sojourn into the arena that other filmmakers avoid - frank sexual adventures of every kind, characters whose placement in the story is often like window dressing for effect, and yet out of it all comes a fascinating if at time discombobulating tale that appeals to a certain audience - and doesn't mind if the rest of the folks who don't approve of his antics even attend!The film follows the life of one Smith (Thomas Dekker) and his everyday life in the dorm - hanging out with his arty, sarcastic best friend Stella (Haley Bennett), hooking up with a beautiful free spirit named London (Juno Temple), lusting for his gorgeous but dim surfer roommate Thor (Chris Zylka).  Smith parties, sleeps around with both men (Jason Olive, Andy Fischer-Price) and women in various combinations. He's bisexual, is about to turn 19 and is having strange dreams which seem to work their way into his life. There's gay sex, lesbian sex, witchcraft, men in animal masks, murder and some secret organization - it all gets turned upside-down after one fateful, terrifying night when all the signs of Smith's dreams seem to come together in a apocalyptic fusion that involves Smith's father (Michael James Spall), Smith's hedonistic mother (Kelly Lynch), and visits from the Messiah! It is a sci-fi story centered on the sexual awakening of a group of college students.Dekker somehow carries this film due to his skills as an actor but also his complete involvement in what is obviously Araki's secondary persona. It is a crazy film, rich in color, at many times ludicrous, and at other times very sexy - you know, the way Gregg Araki continues to make these solid little art house movies. It would be silly to fault KABOOM for being shallow or unserious; its whole mode of being is profoundly antiserious, playfully assaulting any form of earnestness other than Smith's emo melancholy.

This attempt of his works to a certain degree, but I think the main problem here is that he cannot quite bring anything new or interesting to the table. His high energy approach is no longer as effective as it once was, and so while one can admire the picture from an aesthetic perspective, more often than not the picture does not able to sustain itself like it truly should in order to feel fully realized. No matter what approach I take, this film does not truly feel complete, despite every subplot and plot hole being miraculously resolved by the time the film nears completion, and despite a cast of characters with plenty of distinction, characterization, color, and originality.With Kaboom, Araki is, more or less, attempting to combine the dreamlike quality of his masterpiece, Mysterious Skin, with the energy and the over-the-top style of his earlier Teen Apocalypse trilogy, which featured Totally F***ed Up (my favorite of the trilogy), The Doom Generation (a film that I am, very slowly, beginning to understand the brilliance of) and Nowhere (an ugly film that I dislike more and more every day).

No matter what approach I take, this film does not truly feel complete, despite every subplot and plot hole being miraculously resolved by the time the film nears completion, and despite a cast of characters with plenty of distinction, characterization, color, and originality. Kaboom is a film that boasts a number of impressive performances, particularly from Juno Temple who I think gives a performance worthy of being remembered in the next twenty years. We get a lot of creative ideas mixed into this film's novel worth of plot that has everything from perverse love triangles to political conspiracies. The film, however, always feels episodic, as if there isn't a clear thread that we are meant to follow.The film jumps from subplot to subplot, trying to paint a massive picture full of unique ideas and cinematic power, but the end result feels wholly misguided and misinterpreted. The film sounds better in concept and in theory than it does in execution. I could describe the entire plot and everything that occurs within its unusually short runtime, and the average reader would likely think that it sounded terrific and entertaining. The problem comes with actually watching the film and realizing that it does not keep up with itself as well as it should. Much of the film happens in flashback, which is a refreshing approach at first but then grows surprisingly tiresome. We are unable to keep up with the events of the film, so the film feels the need to guide us as if there's any risk of feeling rushed with such a bizarre plot. There are moments of this film that are nothing less than completely terrifying, and there are moments that are very funny, and there are even some moments that are achingly truthful. However, when you put it all together in the way that this film does, it comes across as less like David Lynch and more like M. Night Shyamalan, only without the suspense or the power that even his weakest films manage to muster up. Kaboom has plenty going for it in the image department, and in a way I could easily see this film being admired just for how visually exciting and creative it is. The issue with this, however, comes from the fact that this film has no reason in the world to look this good.Even if someone did like this film and enjoy it completely, there is one major problem with it. I'm going to be honest, I actually did enjoy this film a lot more than you may even realize based on what I've written. Much of what I have written comes more from an objective observation than from my actual viewing experience. However, what absolutely killed this film for me was its ending. It wasn't even how the ending unfolded. I was completely on board with this film's wild theories and themes involving underground cults and incest. Even when the film basically turned into an action movie I was into it. However, the last moments of this film are extremely weak for a film with this kind of energy. I wholly believe that Gregg Araki wanted to merely make a fun little piece of artistic entertainment, but he has to be completely crazy to ever even entertain the idea that people could find the final image of this film to be at all satisfying given what was happening up until that point. I was completely on board with this film, flaws and all, but its final moments are what ultimately kill what is otherwise a perfectly fun film.",2,"Some interesting ideas and images, but overall its a
