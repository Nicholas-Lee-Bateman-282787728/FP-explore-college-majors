547971,A27Q80GZDFZ92K,B00004REEI,Amateur Stargazer,"[0, 0]","These single DVD collections allow you to relive your Twilight Zone memories.  You can own all your favorite episodes, although some of them contain the weaker episodes as well as the stronger ones.  This is one of the better collections. ""Nothing in the Dark"" is a moving story about woman's fear of death and how she overcomes it. It's a bit dark at the beginning, but the ending makes you feel good.  ""The Invaders"" seems to be a standard sci-fi story about a woman in conflict with the aliens who have entered her home, but there is a surprise ending with a different twist. Although a bit sentimental, ""The Night of the Meek"" shows some of what Christmas is all about when a drunken department store Santa Claus becomes a real St. Nick and delivers real presents to everyone.  It's fantasy, but it reminds me of old movies like ""Miracle on 34th St."" The story is rather old-fashioned and nostalgic, which has its own charm.Overall, like many other volumes in the Twilight Zone series, this is a very satisfying DVD.  Most of the DVD's don't have a lot of bonus features other than a biography of Rod Serling and a brief history of the series. But if you don't want to purchase the expensive sets of the entire seasons you can still own your favorite Twilight Zone shows in these good quality collections.",4,Relive your Twilight Zone memories,1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,1309,"['single', 'DVD', 'collections', 'allow', 'relive', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'memories', 'can', 'own', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'contain', 'weaker', 'episodes', 'as', 'well', 'stronger', 'ones', 'one', 'better', 'collections', 'Nothing', 'Dark', 'moving', 'story', 'woman', 'fear', 'death', 'how', 'bit', 'dark', 'beginning', 'ending', 'feel', 'good', 'Invaders', 'be', 'standard', 'sci-fi', 'story', 'woman', 'conflict', 'aliens', 'who', 'have', 'entered', 'home', 'surprise', 'ending', 'different', 'twist', 'bit', 'sentimental', 'Night', 'Meek', 'what', 'Christmas', 'when', 'drunken', 'department', 'store', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'real', 'St.', 'Nick', 'delivers', 'real', 'presents', 'everyone', 'fantasy', 'old', 'movies', 'Miracle', '34th', 'St.', 'story', 'rather', 'old-fashioned', 'nostalgic', 'own', 'charm.Overall', 'many', 'other', 'volumes', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'series', 'very', 'satisfying', 'DVD', 'Most', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'bonus', 'other', 'biography', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'brief', 'history', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'purchase', 'expensive', 'sets', 'entire', 'seasons', 'can', 'still', 'own', 'favorite', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'shows', 'good', 'quality', 'collections']",N/A

If you're stepping into the Zone for thefirst time as a movie/television viewer used to flashy effects, massexplosions, and MTV-type editing, you need to understand a few thingsat the outset: When The Twilight Zone first aired, your televisionchoices were (all in black and white, mind you), Ozzie and Harriet,Leave it to Beaver, Gunsmoke, a couple of cop shows and a few varietyshows.  The Twilight Zone came into living rooms in 1959 with unusual,ground-breaking shows that people talked about for days on end.  Sinceit was an anthology show, every week viewers were presented with newstories and different actors.  You really never knew exactly what toexpect.  At its worst, the Twilight Zone was good TV.  At its best,the show was challenging, stunning, and entertaining in a way that noother show of its time dared.  I agree with most of the otherreviewers.  This is an odd collection of episodes for the introductoryvolume of the series.  &quot;Night of the Meek&quot; contains ArtCarney's touching performance of a department store Santa who drinks alittle too much in an attempt to escape the poverty of hisneighborhood.  Then something strange and wonderfulhappens... &quot;The Invaders&quot; is one of the great episodes fromthe series.  Remember, this episode aired in 1961...think&quot;typical 1961 TV&quot; as I mentioned before, and you won't bedisappointed.  &quot;Nothing in the Dark,&quot; while still a goodepisode, is the weakest of the three in which an old woman tries tokeep death from entering her home.Like others, I was verydisappointed to find only three episodes on this disk instead of four.Also a behind-the-scenes section would have been nice.  The text-onlyextras are okay, but I would have liked to have seen more.  (When youcheck out the extras, read fast!)  The best behind-the-scenes storieson the show are found in a book &quot;The Twilight ZoneCompanion&quot; by Marc Scott Zicree, which I highly recommend.",4,You've Just Crossed Over Into....,983404800,"03 1, 2001",2001,1964,"['Twilight', 'Zone', ""'re"", 'stepping', 'Zone', 'thefirst', 'time', 'movie/television', 'viewer', 'used', 'flashy', 'effects', 'massexplosions', 'MTV-type', 'editing', 'need', 'understand', 'few', 'thingsat', 'outset', 'When', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'first', 'aired', 'televisionchoices', 'were', 'black', 'white', 'mind', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'Gunsmoke', 'couple', 'cop', 'shows', 'few', 'varietyshows', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'came', 'living', 'rooms', '1959', 'unusual', 'ground-breaking', 'shows', 'people', 'talked', 'days', 'end', 'Sinceit', 'was', 'anthology', 'show', 'week', 'viewers', 'were', 'presented', 'newstories', 'different', 'actors', 'really', 'never', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'toexpect', 'worst', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'was', 'good', 'TV', 'best', 'show', 'was', 'challenging', 'stunning', 'entertaining', 'way', 'show', 'time', 'dared', 'agree', 'most', 'otherreviewers', 'odd', 'collection', 'episodes', 'introductoryvolume', 'series', 'quot', 'Night', 'Meek', 'quot', 'ArtCarney', 'touching', 'performance', 'department', 'store', 'Santa', 'who', 'alittle', 'too', 'much', 'attempt', 'escape', 'poverty', 'hisneighborhood', 'Then', 'something', 'strange', 'wonderfulhappens', 'quot', 'Invaders', 'quot', 'one', 'great', 'fromthe', 'series', 'Remember', 'episode', 'aired', '1961', 'think', 'quot', 'typical', '1961', 'TV', 'quot', 'mentioned', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bedisappointed', 'quot', 'Nothing', 'Dark', 'quot', 'still', 'goodepisode', 'weakest', 'three', 'old', 'woman', 'tokeep', 'death', 'entering', 'home.Like', 'others', 'was', 'verydisappointed', 'find', 'only', 'three', 'episodes', 'disk', 'instead', 'four.Also', 'behind-the-scenes', 'section', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'text-onlyextras', 'are', 'okay', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'When', 'youcheck', 'extras', 'read', 'fast', 'best', 'behind-the-scenes', 'storieson', 'show', 'are', 'found', 'book', 'quot', 'Twilight', 'ZoneCompanion', 'quot', 'Marc', 'Scott', 'Zicree', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

One of my personal favourites has always been ""The Invaders"", which stars Agnes Moorehead in a well-plotted performance as an inarticulate woman suddenly faced with fighting off a pair of miniature spacemen.  The twist ending is one of the best, and Ms Moorehead shows her mettle as a serious actress (with lots of unflattering lighting and even a closeup shot in which she's seen drooling).  ""Nothing in the Dark"" is a touching parable on mortality and fear among the elderly; nicely showcasing Dame Gladys Cooper.Episodes:""The Night of the Meek"" (Season Two, Episode #11) - Henry Corwin (Art Carney), a department store Santa Claus, takes to drinking...only to find himself experiencing the nicest Christmas ever!""The Invaders"" (Season Two, Episode #15) - A flying saucer lands on the roof of an isolated house, inhabited by a poor old woman (Agnes Moorehead) - who soon becomes terrorised by two tiny spacemen.""Nothing in the Dark"" (Season Three, Episode #16) - Wanda Dunn (Gladys Cooper) is an old woman who has fought death a thousand times and always won.

You never knew if the episode was a joke or serious until that final zinger. Sometimes you could see them coming, but what the heck pobody's nerfect.The three episodes (only THREE?) on this first volume are beloved by many, loathed by few (I disagree 100% with the one star reviewer) but do not fit well together. I guess they were put together as a representation of The Zone at its most diverse.Night of the Meek: The only Christmas episode the series produced, but they got it close enough to right the first time so why tempt fate? The best thing about it is Art Carney's performance, which, if you only thought he could do Ed Norton, is a stunner.The Invaders: Agnes Moorehead (who speaks no dialogue) is terrorized by teeny alien invaders that have landed their flying saucer on her roof. Jerry Goldsmith's excellent, and legendary, music help lift this episode (which is both playful and scary as hell) up to one of the series all time greats. So what if the Little Spacemen look like wind up toys?Nothing in the Dark: Robert Redford plays an injured police officer that a woman hiding from Mr. Death reluctantly helps. This is far from my favorite Zone, but it does feature gruff character actor R.G. Armstrong in a small role as a man hired to tear the old lady's building down.All three (only THREE???) episodes are good in their own unique way, but they do not play well together.

They have been televised so many times through the years that I have often not paid much attention to them when they were on. Often we take things that are endearing to us for granted. So was the case with these three episodes. NOTHING IN THE DARK has been overshadowed by the stardom of Robert Redford. Watching it again, I found the story by George Clayton Johnson very moving and particularly well acted by Redford and Gladys Cooper. THE INVADERS is a classic episode and one of the backbones of the series.  The writing by Richard Matheson, the performance by Agnes Moorehead, the production values and music all came together to make it one of the quintessential episodes of the series. NIGHT OF THE MEEK is pure Serling all the way. Rod Serling's yearning for those cherished days long gone or a part of ourselves that we think was lost is always evident in his best works. NIGHT OF THE MEEK is very uplifting and may bring a tear to those who cherish this episode. Art Carney showed us all a great dramatic side and depth which enhances this beyond the ordinary. The fact that this was one of the six episodes of the ""Twilight Zone"" that were recorded directly onto videotape instead of film gives it that `live' appearance and helps add to its validity as an icon of the days of `good television.'

There were I believe 45 or somewhere thereabout of these volumns. So in writing this review bare in mind I am writing about Volumn 1 not Season 1.The first volumn starts off with the only Christmas episode that was ever made titled ""Night Of The Meek"". It stars Art Carney who by this time of his appearance on the show had already made a name for himself as Ed Norton on ""The Honeymooners"". He plays a down on his luck drunk who gets a job playing Santa Claus during Christmas. All he wants to do is to make every childs Christmas wish come true but when he loses his job as Santa because of drinking it looks like his chance to make Christmas wishes come true has vanished. Until a chance encounter occurs that changes everything. This is by far the most charming of all the ""Twilight Zone"" episodes. The big surprise in all this is the wonderful acting by Art Carney. This was the first time I ever saw him in a serious role and a far departure as Ralph Kramden's zany best friend we all know and love.Next on the disc is ""The Invaders"". A unique story in that it stars only Agnas Moorehead who has no dialog to speak. The story has her as an old lady living alone in an old farmhouse in the middle of nowhere. Suddenly she hears a strange noise up on the roof and when she goes to investigate finds that a flying saucer has landed there with tiny creature in space suits walking around. What follows is an intense struggle for life between Ms Moorehead and the tiny creatures. This is one episode of the series that really shows the age of the show. The special effects that are used for this show is lame by todays standards. But the writting is so good and Agnes Moorehead gives such a fabulous performance that you tend to overlook the cheezy special effects. I don't want to say anything more on this story so I don't ruin it for anyone who may not have seen this episode yet.The last episode in this volumn is ""Nothing In The Dark"". What most people probably remember about this episode is a very young Robert Redford as a police officer who is shot and left to die. It occurs just in front of the front door to an apartment where an old lady lives and hides away from the rest of the world. The reason why she hides and won't come out is she is afraid of being visited by Mr Death. She is reluctant to help the fallen officer at first out of that fear that Mr Death would get her if she came outside. She eventually brings the injured officer in and tends to his wounds but still won't go out for help and she doesn't have a phone that she could call help on. Of course the irony in all this is that the old lady is afraid to die so as a result she is also afraid to live out of fear of running into Mr Death. Again I don't want to say more on this story on the chance there may be someone reading this who has never seen this story before.Finally I want to comment of a comment that one of the reviewers on this volumn of ""The Twilight Zone"". This reviewer said that at the time ""Twilight Zone"" was amazing but then said now its not even average. How totally wrong you are sir! ""Twilight Zone"" is far far more then some average show. There are many today, including myself, that think TZ is still the greatest TV show in the history of television. Even today ""Twilight Zone "" is better then at least 90%, if not more, of what is on TV today and still manages to enthrall millions of viewers after all these years. Average!? Hardly!

Bernabo,"[11, 13]","What you might expect to find on Volume 1 of ""The Twilight Zone"" DVD series would be the pilot episode, but that proves not to be the case. What you will find are a trio of classic episodes where the performances by the actors are as memorable as the stories with their infamous ""Twilight Zone"" twists that characterized Rod Serling's celebrated television anthology series:Episode 51, ""The Invaders"" (Written by Richard Matheson, First aired January 27,1 961) offers a tour de force performance by Agnes Moorhead, long after she appeared in ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" for Orson Welles, and shortly before she became Endora on ""Bewitched."" Moorhead plays a woman living alone in a farmhouse who finds that a miniature flying saucer has landed on her roof. The woman has to fight against the strange tiny invaders with their advanced technology. But then remember, this is ""The Twilight Zone.""Episode 47, ""Night of the Meek"" (Written by Rod Serling, First aired December 23, 1960) is the only Christmas episode in the original run of ""The Twilight Zone."" Poor Henry Corwin (Art Carney), a department store Santa, shows up drunk on Christmas Eve and is fired. Wandering the streets, he discovers a magic bag that can dispense any gift he asks for. The question is, what will Henry do with this most unusual bag? If you are a fan of the ""Zone"" then you have probably heard the legend that Serling wrote the episode just to see Art Carney play Santa Claus. The excellent support casts features two of the best character actors of all time with John Fielder as Henry's short-tempered boss and Burt Mustin as a friendly bum on the streets, but this is Art Carney's triumph. The episode was one of six shot during the second season on videotape instead of film, but that is a minor complaint because it just makes ""Night of the Meek"" seem like a live television broadcast from the 1950s.Episode 81, ""Nothing in the Dark"" (Written by George Clayton Johnson, First aired January 5, 1962) offers veteran character actress Gladys Cooper as Wanda Dunn, an old woman who has barricaded herself in her basement apartment for years, fearing that Mr. Death with kill her with a touch. Wanda knows that Death can take many disguises. But despite her fears, when Harold Beldon, a young policeman is shot outside her door, she drags him inside. Of course, the fact Beldon is played by Robert Redford might have something to do with her letting her guard down. A nice little grace note from the ""Zone.""his DVD includes ""Inside The Twilight Zone"", with information on Rod Serling, a history of the series, reviews of each episode, cast information and a season-by-season commentary. Not a bad first disc, but there is much better to come (Volume 2 is the best in the series). However, you will not find a better trio of performances than you find here with Moorhead, Carney and Cooper.  Plus that Redford fellow is not bad looking.

547985,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B00004REEI,magellan,"[13, 16]","As others have already commented on the features and technical aspects of this set (which were generally well regarded), I thought I would make a few comments more on the episodes themselves.This series aired for a few years in the early 60s (although it started in 1959) and immediately passed into pop culture and TV legend. Many famous actors and actresses, or soon to be famous, appeared in the show. I especially remembered the episode with Robert Redford, who was probably in his mid to late 20s but who looked 18, playing Mr. Death who had come to get an old woman.In addition to Serling, the main writers for the show were Charles Beaumont and Richard Matheson, who had already established reputations as fantasy writers, and who wrote many of the episodes. There was one other writer who did contribute some episodes, but unfortunately I can't recall the name.I wasn't a fan of the original series as I was a little young at the time, having been born in the early 50s, but I saw some of the shows in reruns in the mid-60s. I was more of a fan of the Outer Limits, Lost in Space, and Star Trek, and only caught saw maybe a dozen episodes at the time. So at age 53, I decided to buy seasons 1-4 and finally watch most of the episodes. (I still need to find the last season, number 5).I was pleased to see how well they have held up. It was the drab 50s and then turbulent 60s, and the Cold War, with its threat of possible nuclear annihilation, was in full swing. Perhaps that explains the pervasive film noir ambience and dark mood that often hangs like a pall over many of the episodes. Although the characters are drawn from all levels of society and from all walks of life--from two-bit criminals to the rich and famous--many are just various and sundry low-lifes, riff-raff, criminals, and grifters. And then there are the simply down and out--the bored or emotionally overwrought, old and unwanted, middle-aged and overstressed, desperate housewives, the dyspeptic, dispossessed, or depressed, and your average guy just down on his luck.There were the few episodes that made an attempt at humor, but as the editorial review mentions, they don't seem to have held up as well as the other episodes. It was also interesting to see how often science fictional themes cropped up--although the science aspect isn't so important as the fact that a futuristic scenario allowed Serling to explore another dark topic--such as in the episode starring Jack Warden, who has been unjustly sentenced to a lonely existence on an uninhabited asteroid. He is going mad from isolation, his only contact with the outside world being the few minutes every 3 months when the supply ship comes to drop off supplies.So overall, I'm finding it to still be a great series that has stood the test of time. This is truly a great slice of Americana, from a younger, simpler, less complex America that is now long gone.A brief note here. The only reason for four instead of five stars is the many extra features The Definitive Edition contains. Some people may not care about those, which cost extra. These mainly include special commentary, interviews with writers and actors, photos from the first season, the separate music scores, Serling's rare blooper, his Netherlands sales pitch (the show was selected to appear in Holland), The Twilight Zone comic book in .pdf format, and his Emmy Award appearance (the Emmy's were hosted by Chuck Connors and Fred Astaire).

As a sci-fi fan I was attracted by ""The Twilight Zone"" proposal. At that time I wasn't able to see more than a score of episodes, but they remain in my memory with extraordinary persistence.Thanks to the technological marvel of DVD I'm able to see these amazing stories again and find them as magical & thought provoking as 45 years ago.As the structure of the episodes are mostly bounded to a surprise ending or to the argument in a very short span of time, usually 25 minutes each, I'll focus my review more on outstanding features than on the topic of the episode in order not to spoil the pleasure of the viewer.Disk 1 contains only three chapters but wow! Two of them are extraordinary.1) The Invaders - An emblematic episode, only one character, a lone woman in an isolate house receives the unexpected visit of a tiny ""flying saucer"" with two small aliens.She doesn't utter a word and all the tension is focused in her mute wild chase of the aliens.Agnes Moorhead, best known by her role as Endora the Witch Mother of ""Bewitched"", gives an extraordinary performance.Cinematography in charge of George Clemens deserves a special mention. He won Emmy Award 1961 and nominations for the same honor 1962 & 1963 all due to several episodes of this series.Qualification: 10.2) The Night of the Meek - This is a rather conventional Christmas episode, nevertheless it manages to touch viewer's emotional chord.Qualification: 7.3) Nothing in the Dark - An old lady is entrenched in her basement apartment in order to avoid Mr. Death visit. However there are people trying to make her leave her bunker as those buildings are going to be demolished.Gladys Cooper impersonates entrenched Wanda with authority but surprise, surprise her acting partner is... Robert Redford! Very young, very charismatic & very proficient.Qualification: 10.This DVD format has two great advantages: it has a very good price and allows buyers to choose their favorite chapters without needing to buy the whole series.Reviewed by Max Yofre.",5,Entering the Mists of Unbounded Imagination.,1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,2083,"['teens', 'one', 'series', 'more', 'fondly', 'remember', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'was', 'attracted', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'proposal', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'see', 'more', 'score', 'episodes', 'remain', 'memory', 'extraordinary', 'persistence.Thanks', 'technological', 'marvel', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'able', 'see', 'amazing', 'stories', 'again', 'find', 'magical', 'thought', 'provoking', '45', 'years', 'ago.As', 'structure', 'episodes', 'are', 'mostly', 'bounded', 'surprise', 'ending', 'argument', 'very', 'short', 'span', 'time', 'usually', '25', 'minutes', ""'ll"", 'focus', 'review', 'more', 'outstanding', 'features', 'topic', 'episode', 'order', 'not', 'spoil', 'pleasure', 'viewer.Disk', '1', 'contains', 'only', 'three', 'chapters', 'wow', 'Two', 'are', 'extraordinary.1', 'Invaders', 'emblematic', 'episode', 'only', 'one', 'character', 'lone', 'woman', 'isolate', 'house', 'unexpected', 'visit', 'tiny', 'flying', 'saucer', 'two', 'small', 'aliens.She', ""n't"", 'utter', 'word', 'tension', 'focused', 'mute', 'wild', 'chase', 'aliens.Agnes', 'Moorhead', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'Endora', 'Witch', 'Mother', 'Bewitched', 'extraordinary', 'performance.Cinematography', 'charge', 'George', 'Clemens', 'special', 'mention', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Award', '1961', 'nominations', 'same', 'honor', '1962', '1963', 'due', 'several', 'episodes', 'series.Qualification', '10.2', 'Night', 'Meek', 'rather', 'conventional', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'touch', 'viewer', 'emotional', 'chord.Qualification', '7.3', 'Nothing', 'Dark', 'old', 'lady', 'entrenched', 'basement', 'apartment', 'order', 'avoid', 'Mr.', 'Death', 'visit', 'However', 'are', 'people', 'trying', 'make', 'leave', 'bunker', 'buildings', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'demolished.Gladys', 'Cooper', 'entrenched', 'Wanda', 'authority', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'acting', 'partner', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Very', 'young', 'very', 'charismatic', 'very', 'proficient.Qualification', '10.This', 'DVD', 'format', 'two', 'great', 'advantages', 'very', 'good', 'price', 'buyers', 'choose', 'favorite', 'chapters', 'needing', 'buy', 'whole', 'series.Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",N/A

While ""Invaders"" and ""Nothing in the Dark"" are well worth the cost of this CD, there are better volumes in Collection One from which to choose.",4,"Strong Episodes, but Short",1048291200,"03 22, 2003",2003,608,"['short', 'first', 'volume', 'collected', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'features', 'two', 'strong', 'episodes', 'timid', 'undeveloped', 'one', 'Invaders', 'almost', 'dialogue', 'achievement', 'suspense', 'amazing', 'ending', 'Nothing', 'Dark', 'featuring', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'deep', 'questions', 'fears', 'death', 'first', 'episode', 'Night', 'Meek', 'Art', 'Carney', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'had', 'potential', 'good', 'story', 'lacked', 'serious', 'conflict', 'drama', 'Invaders', 'Nothing', 'Dark', 'are', 'well', 'cost', 'CD', 'are', 'better', 'volumes', 'Collection', 'One', 'choose']",N/A

Art Carney gives a very nice performance as a drunken Santa.  It has a nice good uplifting feel when Santa finds ""that bag.""  I think this is one very underated episode and I like the message of hope.THE INVADERS = 2 STARSI never been a big fan of this episode.  I have always found the ""The Invaders"" lacking in pace.  The whole episode has no dialogue and consists of an old lady running around knocking out wind-up toy robots (spacemen).  Even the guys who created this episode did not like the way it turned out.  The saving grace is the story of fear/isolation and the twist at the end.NOTHING IN THE DARK = 4 STARSRobert Redford plays the big nasty Mr.Death in this episode.  This was a very well acted piece with great dialogue.

It was a show I never missed, and now I can see them all again.  I was afraid they wouldn't hold up well, that my recollection of them was about to be destroyed.  But, no.Art Carney is excellent as a besotted and disillusioned Santa.  The theme is a little preachy and the snow looks more like soap flakes than winter precipitation.  This is probably the least of the 3 episodes on the disk, but it's still pretty good.  Art Carney's performance alone is worthwhile.Agnes Moorhead is the only real character in the second episode, a lonely woman in a remote farmhouse.  A spaceship crashes into her attic and she has to fight the tiny aliens with the primitive weapons at hand.  The spacemen shoot her and raise blisters on her skin.  She doesn't have a single word of dialogue, just moans and grunts, and it doesn't matter.  This is a real classic, one that never left my mind in almost fifty years.In the third episode, a boyish Robert Redford plays a wounded cop who falls at the doorway of a condemned building.  The only occupant is an old woman who is afraid of letting Death in and suspects the wounded cop of being Death.  The story is not one of the best of the series, but it is better than some.TV never got better than Rod Serling's Twilight Zone.
