They could have called this movie ""Dingbats Running"". Being a sucker for a romantic story in the middle of all the slashing, it would have added to the story if the nerd had gotten the girl in the end, instead of becoming just another victim. This movie had potential, but never reached it. Had I rented it, I would never have bought it, yet it was not a total waste, just as acting classes for some in the film would not be a total waste.",2,Almost Better,1160784000,"10 14, 2006",2006,534,"['movie', 'was', 'okay', 'almost', 'better', 'acting', 'was', 'lacking', 'acted', 'okay', 'Others', 'sucked', 'could', 'have', 'called', 'movie', 'Running', 'Being', 'sucker', 'romantic', 'story', 'middle', 'slashing', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'story', 'nerd', 'had', 'gotten', 'girl', 'end', 'instead', 'becoming', 'just', 'victim', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'never', 'reached', 'Had', 'rented', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'bought', 'was', 'not', 'total', 'waste', 'just', 'acting', 'classes', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'total', 'waste']",Slaughterhouse Phi: Death Sisters

Yes, it's shot direct to DVD and the acting is typical B-Horror (e-gads! what a shock!) but it was fun and there were so many homages to the Slumber Party Massacres, High Night, Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-a-rama and the Burning. Randal Malone's detective reminded me of the gumshoe from Fred Olan Ray's classic Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers (yay, a Linnea Quigley flick!) and he played it straight and sincere, though I would have had him a bit more gun-happy like Mel Gibson but I can't have everything.

Rather than inform the authorities, they dump her in a creepy old burnt out orphanage. The initiation has the girls wearing bra/panties with stockings, heels and a cape. Not the worse fantasy costumes. The sheriff is overweight and sets off your gay-dar.One year later the Tri Phi girls are having their pledge initiation in the same orphanage. You should know the rest. Acting was bad and at times comical. The plot, heck, you know it. The special effects include an echo machine, slow motion for running scenes, CG gun fire, fake blood and some fake gore.F-bomb, no sex, no nudity but lots of lingerie.",2,"PHI, PHI, PHI",1315267200,"09 6, 2011",2011,746,"['beginning', 'Tri', 'Phi', 'sorority', 'house', 'accidentally', 'pledge', 'heart', 'attack', 'were', 'sacrificing', 'Satan', 'Rather', 'inform', 'authorities', 'dump', 'creepy', 'old', 'burnt', 'out', 'orphanage', 'initiation', 'girls', 'wearing', 'bra/panties', 'stockings', 'heels', 'cape', 'Not', 'worse', 'fantasy', 'costumes', 'sheriff', 'overweight', 'sets', 'off', 'gay-dar.One', 'year', 'later', 'Tri', 'Phi', 'girls', 'are', 'having', 'pledge', 'initiation', 'same', 'orphanage', 'should', 'know', 'rest', 'Acting', 'was', 'bad', 'times', 'comical', 'plot', 'heck', 'know', 'special', 'effects', 'include', 'echo', 'machine', 'slow', 'motion', 'running', 'scenes', 'CG', 'gun', 'fire', 'fake', 'blood', 'fake', 'gore.F-bomb', 'sex', 'nudity', 'lots', 'lingerie']",Slaughterhouse Phi: Death Sisters

It's an insult to all of our great slasher flicks (Friday the 13th, Halloween, etc...)  This movie was poorly produced, the actors had no acting ability whatsoever, the camera work was lousy, and the plot sucks.  Don't buy this for the hopes of seeing hot women either, they aren't there.  Nothing but homely women with sloppy bodies.  The weapon was PLASTIC too, nice touch!!
