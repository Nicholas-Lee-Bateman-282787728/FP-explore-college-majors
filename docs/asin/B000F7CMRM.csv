Trying to create an accurate depiction of the many realities and complexities of oil politics using the medium of film in which to do it is monumentous task, is it not? Basically SYRIANA's complicated plot is a take on the world's oil addiction the same way the film TRAFFIC deals with America's addiction to drugs. We see the situation multi-perspectively, all those involved shown and connections made between them. SYRIANA is successful I think in giving the sense it's a small, complicated, corrupt world filled with delusions, lies, and violence.

The film has the feel of a behind the scenes documentary where the viewer is able to watch key players abuse authority, power, position, etc. to make as much dough as possible while keeping as much oil as possible flowing into the U.S.Extraordinarily prescient, given the fact that the Middle East has passed their Peak Oil Production (including Saudia Arabia some time between 2002 and 2006), as we had done in the early 70's (around the time of the oil crisis) and Russia had in the 80's. The North Sea is also virtually used up. With China and India soon to overtake American consumers as the chief abusers of this quickly depleting natural resource, it is no wonder why we are witnessing the U.S. government taking over one of the largest oil producers in the world, and another big oil producer attempting to arm itself with nukes in order to prevent the U.S. from attempting to 'steal' or manipulate their oil situation. Without oil, modern American society would alter dramatically in a verynegative way and that is why some believe that it is necessary to do absolutely whatever it takes to grab our share of oil - even if it means the unlawful invasion of a sovereign nation.And that is what Syriana shows - unscrupulous, corrupt sociopaths murdering and screwing everybody over for every last barrel they can get before it runs out.I understand that many Americans *choose* to ignore or disbelieve that oil is indeed running out with all major oil fields having surpassed their peaks (which doesn't mean we are only halfway through it, as anywhere up to the last 10-25% of a given oil field is extremely poor quality not to mention more expensive to extract as could ever possibly be gained on the market).  It is a scary thought, and people *choose* to ignore facts. Ignorance is bliss, as they say.

It has been said time and again that the movie has too many threads to follow.  That may be true, but you don't need a notebook to appreciate this movie.  Getting the gist of the plot is a better idea and just go along for the ride.  The characters are well-done, the tension is formidable, and the revelations are relevant and interesting.  We are asked to follow all of the main players in the world oil market, including an American oil broker in Europe (Matt Damon) who puts a PR face of the petroleum industry.  We also follow the CIA via a member (George Clooney) and his complicated identities and missions.  Then we follow the oil industry directly through a corporate lawyer (Jeremy Wright) and his attempts to create a major merger.  Meanwhile, diplomats and militant jihadists are maneuvering to make their mark.  The stakes of greed, terrorism, and world need are demonstrated well throughout.  Some of the best scenes in the movie show the price that the CIA agent and the understudy jihadist take to advance their agendas.""Syriana"" isn't an easy movie to take, but it is enlightening.  One can lament political correctness, but the question is not whether it has a political agenda, but does it ring true?  The movie does well to illustrate its point, and only preaches when necessary and only when it manifests naturally through the dialogue.  (Unlike ""The Constant Gardener,"" another excellent film, ""Syriana"" shows us more than tells us about dire situations.)  Also, the interlocking stories are not as clearly or neatly woven like in ""Nine Lives"" or ""Crash,"" but that's more of an asset; one that makes the movie more realistic.  It is not mere clamor to show that as our oil resources are dwindling, and developing nations are becoming more oil dependent, creating the math that will add up to some sort of (more major) crisis.  If you don't mind the story as it's presented, ""Syriana"" is a fine and illuminating movie.",4,The Plot Spills Well and Abundantly,1148515200,"05 25, 2006",2006,1996,"['Syriana', 'complicated', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'been', 'said', 'time', 'again', 'movie', 'too', 'many', 'threads', 'follow', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'notebook', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'Getting', 'gist', 'plot', 'better', 'idea', 'just', 'go', 'along', 'ride', 'characters', 'are', 'well-done', 'tension', 'formidable', 'revelations', 'are', 'relevant', 'interesting', 'are', 'asked', 'follow', 'main', 'players', 'world', 'oil', 'market', 'including', 'American', 'oil', 'broker', 'Europe', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'who', 'PR', 'face', 'petroleum', 'industry', 'also', 'follow', 'CIA', 'member', 'George', 'Clooney', 'complicated', 'identities', 'missions', 'Then', 'follow', 'oil', 'industry', 'directly', 'corporate', 'lawyer', 'Jeremy', 'Wright', 'attempts', 'create', 'major', 'merger', 'Meanwhile', 'diplomats', 'militant', 'jihadists', 'are', 'maneuvering', 'make', 'mark', 'stakes', 'greed', 'terrorism', 'world', 'need', 'are', 'demonstrated', 'well', 'best', 'scenes', 'movie', 'show', 'price', 'CIA', 'agent', 'understudy', 'jihadist', 'take', 'advance', 'agendas', 'Syriana', ""n't"", 'easy', 'movie', 'take', 'enlightening', 'One', 'can', 'lament', 'political', 'correctness', 'question', 'not', 'political', 'agenda', 'ring', 'true', 'movie', 'well', 'illustrate', 'point', 'only', 'preaches', 'when', 'necessary', 'only', 'when', 'naturally', 'dialogue', 'Constant', 'Gardener', 'excellent', 'film', 'Syriana', 'more', 'tells', 'dire', 'situations', 'Also', 'interlocking', 'stories', 'are', 'not', 'clearly', 'neatly', 'woven', 'Nine', 'Crash', 'more', 'asset', 'one', 'movie', 'more', 'realistic', 'not', 'mere', 'clamor', 'show', 'oil', 'resources', 'are', 'dwindling', 'developing', 'nations', 'are', 'becoming', 'more', 'oil', 'dependent', 'creating', 'math', 'will', 'add', 'up', 'sort', 'more', 'major', 'crisis', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'story', 'presented', 'Syriana', 'fine', 'illuminating', 'movie']",N/A

A Slezak ""Incredulous Reader""","[4, 6]","I have read Sleeping With the Devil: How Washington Sold Our Soul for Saudi Crude by Robert Baer and I really loved it.  It gave me a lot of insight on people in the Middle East and it was a real page turner.  I assumed his book See No Evil would be similar and that the movie made from it would be exciting and thought provoking.  Instead, this came across as a pitch for the liberal agenda.Every one in the government and big business is evil and if you try to do the right thing like the one Prince tries to do you get removed.  Some people think that the head of the oil company is suppose to be like Bush but I some how think they are trying to imply Cheney with the hunting part.  I was waiting for Chris Cooper to shoot Jeffery Wright on the hunting trip by accident.  In the end he sells out anyway because everyone is looking out for himself or herself.I guess I didn't understand why the Arabs in the film were so mad at the oil companies because they got laid off.  I suppose it was the only job they could get in that part of the country.  I don't understand why they just didn't go home, was it even worse there or what?  I also didn't believe the fact that these Arabs after a little religious talking turn in to maniocs who want to kill themselves when some religious leader tells them to.  I'm sure there must be some like that but after years of indoctrination.  These guys just seemed to out of work for 6 months to 1 year.There were scenes I did like that made me jump like the torture scene with Bob and Jimmy but that was few and far between.  I also like the Christopher Plummer role as Dr. Evil.There seemed to be too many stories going on at the same time to make it interesting enough to follow. If they would have got rid of the Matt Damon character and family and focused more on the background stories of the other characters they could have made this more of an interesting film.  They could have added more of espionage plot and make it more believable.In the scene when George Clooney knows they are targeting the Emir and gets there and just stands around instead of saying get out and hit the deck or something.  I also didn't believe that a group at the CIA would cold heartily kill from the command head quarters with a whole group around and no one say this guy has a wife and kid with him.  I could see one individual do that but not the whole group.  In a group they would have to worry that someone was going to rat them out and they would have to play by some laws.The deleted scene were limited and showed Bob's wife who I don't seem to remember being in any of the movie. In the talk with Clooney section he seems to try to tell you that they were trying to give an objective view which I think is a bunch of bologna.I guess I was expecting more of an exciting spy movie.",2,Not like the book,1151366400,"06 27, 2006",2006,2813,"['have', 'read', 'Sleeping', 'Devil', 'How', 'Washington', 'Sold', 'Soul', 'Saudi', 'Crude', 'Robert', 'Baer', 'really', 'loved', 'gave', 'lot', 'insight', 'people', 'Middle', 'East', 'was', 'real', 'page', 'turner', 'assumed', 'book', 'See', 'No', 'Evil', 'would', 'be', 'similar', 'movie', 'made', 'would', 'be', 'exciting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'Instead', 'came', 'pitch', 'liberal', 'agenda.Every', 'one', 'government', 'big', 'business', 'evil', 'try', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'one', 'Prince', 'tries', 'do', 'get', 'removed', 'people', 'think', 'head', 'oil', 'company', 'suppose', 'be', 'Bush', 'how', 'think', 'are', 'trying', 'imply', 'Cheney', 'hunting', 'part', 'was', 'waiting', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'shoot', 'Jeffery', 'Wright', 'hunting', 'trip', 'accident', 'end', 'out', 'anyway', 'everyone', 'looking', 'out', 'herself.I', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Arabs', 'film', 'were', 'so', 'mad', 'oil', 'companies', 'got', 'laid', 'off', 'suppose', 'was', 'only', 'job', 'could', 'get', 'part', 'country', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'home', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'there', 'what', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'fact', 'Arabs', 'little', 'religious', 'talking', 'turn', 'maniocs', 'who', 'want', 'kill', 'when', 'religious', 'leader', ""'m"", 'sure', 'must', 'be', 'years', 'indoctrination', 'guys', 'just', 'seemed', 'work', '6', 'months', '1', 'year.There', 'were', 'scenes', 'did', 'made', 'jump', 'torture', 'scene', 'Bob', 'Jimmy', 'was', 'few', 'far', 'also', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Evil.There', 'seemed', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'stories', 'going', 'same', 'time', 'make', 'interesting', 'enough', 'follow', 'would', 'have', 'got', 'rid', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'character', 'family', 'focused', 'more', 'background', 'stories', 'other', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'interesting', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'more', 'espionage', 'plot', 'make', 'more', 'scene', 'when', 'George', 'Clooney', 'are', 'targeting', 'Emir', 'there', 'just', 'stands', 'instead', 'saying', 'get', 'hit', 'deck', 'something', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'group', 'CIA', 'would', 'cold', 'heartily', 'kill', 'command', 'head', 'quarters', 'whole', 'group', 'one', 'say', 'guy', 'wife', 'kid', 'could', 'see', 'one', 'individual', 'do', 'not', 'whole', 'group', 'group', 'would', 'have', 'worry', 'someone', 'was', 'going', 'rat', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'play', 'laws.The', 'deleted', 'scene', 'were', 'limited', 'showed', 'Bob', 'wife', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'remember', 'being', 'movie', 'talk', 'Clooney', 'section', 'try', 'tell', 'were', 'trying', 'give', 'objective', 'view', 'think', 'bunch', 'bologna.I', 'guess', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'exciting', 'spy', 'movie']",N/A

The movie shines much more true with all the events that have occurred in the past several months.Syriana stars an all star cast of many great actors.  They all come together to tell a story of how America is working hard to keep our oil secure and in our best interests.  Whether you like the fact that oil is a big part of our lively hood it is a reality.  The story is divided into many parts that eventually come together in some way or another.Two oil companies are merging together in hopes of controlling more of the industry.  Working to destabilize Iran enough to hopefully get control of their oil stakes.  This is a multi billion dollar business.  This sounds all to familiar to people who watch the news.  The movie then works to bleed all the stories together thru a complex web.If you are looking for a great story that is not action filled and will keep you thinking Syriana is a must see.  The movie doesn't pull any punches.  In many ways it is sad and scary.  This movie doesn't offer any sure fire cures for future ills but hopefully with the message people will listen and take some action.,4,A Sad and Scary Look at a World that is all to Close,1198281600,"12 22, 2007",2007,1230,"['may', 'call', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'Liberal', 'fest', 'American', 'Government', 'look', 'corrupt', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'true', 'events', 'have', 'occurred', 'past', 'several', 'months.Syriana', 'stars', 'star', 'cast', 'many', 'great', 'actors', 'come', 'together', 'tell', 'story', 'how', 'America', 'working', 'hard', 'keep', 'oil', 'secure', 'best', 'interests', 'fact', 'oil', 'big', 'part', 'lively', 'hood', 'reality', 'story', 'divided', 'many', 'parts', 'eventually', 'come', 'together', 'way', 'another.Two', 'oil', 'companies', 'are', 'merging', 'together', 'hopes', 'controlling', 'more', 'industry', 'Working', 'destabilize', 'Iran', 'enough', 'hopefully', 'get', 'control', 'oil', 'stakes', 'multi', 'billion', 'dollar', 'business', 'familiar', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'news', 'movie', 'then', 'bleed', 'stories', 'together', 'thru', 'complex', 'web.If', 'are', 'looking', 'great', 'story', 'not', 'action', 'filled', 'will', 'keep', 'thinking', 'Syriana', 'must', 'see', 'movie', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'many', 'ways', 'sad', 'scary', 'movie', ""n't"", 'offer', 'sure', 'fire', 'cures', 'future', 'ills', 'hopefully', 'message', 'people', 'will', 'listen', 'take', 'action']",N/A
984651,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000F7CMRM,A Customer,"[7, 12]","Picture this: a multi-national merger of two giant American oil companies; an oil producing Arab nation that needs to cut a deal to ensure its survival in the global marketplace; a hot shot energy analyst who is in it for the money; a washed up CIA agent on one last mission, and an impoverished Pakistani oil worker who is told he no longer has a job.These are just some of the scenarios playing out in writer/director Stephen Gaghan's incendiary Syriana, a fierce meditation on the marriage of geo-politics, business, oil and money. The plot is complicated and occasionally confuses, and the film is often overly didactic, abstract and muddled - sometimes to the point of incoherence - but with all its faults, Syriana really manages to convince you that this is how global power really works.The announcement that an oil-rich, but struggling, emirate in the Persian Gulf has transferred drilling rights from Connex, a giant Texas firm, to the higher-bidding People's Republic of China sets of a firestorm throughout the global reigns of power. A number of people are instantly affected, all at different ends of the geopolitical spectrum. Connex owner Jimmy Pope (Chris Cooper) decides to merge with a smaller company called Killen to offset the merger.Killen has acquired the drilling rights to a rich field in Kazakhstan. But the American Justice Department lead by Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) are suspect and employ Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright), a smooth, controlled Washington lawyer to watch over the union.Meanwhile, Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon), an energy analyst who lives with his wife, Julie (Amanda Peet) and their two sons in posh Geneva, suddenly finds himself becoming an advisor to the idealistic, sophisticated Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig). Bryan is after Nasir to build a pipeline through Iran and export his oil to Europe because there's big money to be made and Bryan is convinced it will benefit the Emirate.Wasim Kahn (Mazhar Munir) is a poor Pakistani oil field worker employed by Connex in the Emirate who loses his job when the firm loses those drilling rights to the Chinese. He finds solace in one of the many madras's that are springing up around the country and is eventually invited to join an elite group for training as a suicide bomber.And then there's veteran CIA field operative Bob Barnes (George Clooney), a used and beaten down intelligence agent who speaks Arabic and Farsi and is always involved in insalubrious clandestine operations. Barnes gets drawn into what is happening in the Emirate and his life is placed in danger.Although these characters never formerly meet, yet they are linked in totally logical ways as Gaghan morphs together the issues of big business, oil and terrorism. This movie won't be for everyone, the narrative is terribly conceptual and opaque with much of the dialogue consisting of furtive double-speak - suddenly we are dropped right into the middle of situations, enter rooms after the action has started, and hear conversations that have already begun, and the film is edited in such a way that characters drift in and out of the story at a moments notice.Perhaps the best option is to enjoy the film's individual dramatic elements as they whiz by and hope that it all gels in the end, which in many respects it does. Of course George Clooney one the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for playing Bob, and it was well deserved too, but the performances in Syriana really do play second fiddle to the issues and this incredible sense that there's some kind of underhanded conspiracy going on that we as average citizens have little control over.In the end, the movie challenges us to be a type of fly on the wall, witnessing America's controversial foreign policy as all the shady power brokers from the government to big business direct and deal, and gradually pull the strings that control the flow of oil and money backwards and forwards from the Middle East to the West.

We have to admit that these new countries have the basic elements of reserving the human right and have nothing in common with countries like Syria (where I come from) or Egypt.The fact that Pakistanis or any other Asian workers may turn to be living bombs is not correct either; people work here all the time and make good money, which is, usually, the anti-living-bomb formula. The Jihadists in these countries are usually citizens who go abroad for fighting and not the opposite.The influence of the young oil broker on the so-called Idealistic Prince is very exaggerating; this could have worked in the early 70's, but Sheikhs and princes in the gulf have now teams of experts and lot of consulting agencies... things are not that simple anymore.Then it's Hizboullah of Lebanon, which is a devoted party for the Shia sect that totally concentrates on Lebanon and its (exaggerated) struggle with Israel. This party has absolutely no influence in the Gulf countries.Finally the film's hero, the CIA man... and the simple fact that he was not aware of all the dirty business hiding under the surface of Oil industry after all this years of working in the Middle East, which would be a disaster for the effectiveness of his powerful agency; this is really not accepted standard.After all, what remain of the movie?

984656,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000F7CMRM,Alex Udvary,"[4, 7]","In Stephan Gaghan's screenplay for ""Traffic"" the prize was drugs, in ""Syriana"" everyone is after oil. The characters are the same only the names have changed. These people are cunning and ruthless. They care about no one but themselves.The same day this movie came out I read an article in the New York Times stating "" Americans do not trust business or the people who run it."" ""Syriana"" will not help their cause.The movie is a complicated one. We follow a group of people, some who know each other, some who don't, who all seems to affect the other's life. This is the kind of movie you should know nothing  about. Don't worry about the plot, don't read the critics. In fact, I'd prefer you don't read this until you've seen the movie. To give you the slightest bit of information is to give away too much. The film should catch you by surprise and unfold before your eyes. That is the only real way to come to care about any of these characters.As with ""Good Night, And Good Luck"" (another film I recommend you see) some people will accuse this movie of being Liberal. With ""Good Night"" I was willing to let the remark slide but this time I'm going to have to fight back against the Conservative Elite. ""Syriana"" is not offering left-wing talking points, nor is it offering right-wing. The movie doesn't take sides. As with the film ""Traffic"" (which I always felt deserved the Oscar over ""Gladiator"") both films look at a problem and try to deal with it in the most realistic way possible but never offer a solution. To offer a solution means the problem will go away, both films deal with topics so big there are no easy solutions.""Syriana"" opens in time for the big Oscar campaigns, the time when Hollywood saves its good movies. I could definitely see a few Oscar nominations coming this film's way. It would please me greatly if Christopher Plumber were to receive an Oscar nomination for ""Best Supporting Actor"" and Gaghan for ""Best Screenplay"".And what about George Clooney? This seems to be his year. First writing and directing the exceptional ""Good Night, And Good Luck"" and now giving quite a powerful performance here. Clooney has managed to turn me into a fan.But there are some things about this film I didn't like. I didn't care for the editing. I found a few shots unnecessary and at times disliked the cinematography. I feel the biggest downfall of the film though is we never get to really understand these people. Their concerns are never our concerns. Gaghan was able to accomplish this in ""Traffic"" and other emsemble films released this year also succeeding in doing so, ""Crash"" for instance, but ""Syriana"" takes on so much, many times the viewer feels overwhelmed. We feel we are missing something. We are playing a game of catch up and this becomes distracting.Still despite everything ""Syriana"" is nicely crafted, expertly directed and well acted. Amanda Peet gives her best performance. I realize going over her credits that's not saying much, but it doesn't make the statement any less true. Some moments in this film are truly great. They are highly emotional and real. And as for Gaghan himself this is a notch above his previous film ""Abandon"" but a step beneath ""Traffic"", still it shows a great deal of promise for things to come. Which is more than we can say about some of the characters in this movie.Bottom-line: Ambitious, grand-scale film that has some truly wonderful moments. The cast has moments where they shine but the film is too complex to really follow. There is no real understanding of these people still the movie is worth your time.",3,Complex But Worthwhile,1134172800,"12 10, 2005",2005,3584,"['Stephan', 'Gaghan', 'screenplay', 'Traffic', 'prize', 'was', 'drugs', 'Syriana', 'everyone', 'oil', 'characters', 'are', 'same', 'only', 'names', 'have', 'changed', 'people', 'are', 'cunning', 'ruthless', 'care', 'one', 'themselves.The', 'same', 'day', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'read', 'article', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'stating', 'Americans', 'do', 'not', 'trust', 'business', 'people', 'who', 'run', 'Syriana', 'will', 'not', 'help', 'cause.The', 'movie', 'complicated', 'one', 'follow', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'other', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'who', 'affect', 'other', 'life', 'kind', 'movie', 'should', 'know', 'nothing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'critics', 'fact', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'give', 'slightest', 'bit', 'information', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'should', 'catch', 'surprise', 'unfold', 'eyes', 'only', 'real', 'way', 'come', 'care', 'characters.As', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'film', 'recommend', 'see', 'people', 'will', 'accuse', 'movie', 'being', 'Liberal', 'Good', 'Night', 'was', 'willing', 'let', 'remark', 'slide', 'time', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'fight', 'back', 'Conservative', 'Elite', 'Syriana', 'not', 'offering', 'left-wing', 'talking', 'points', 'offering', 'right-wing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'take', 'sides', 'film', 'Traffic', 'always', 'felt', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'Gladiator', 'films', 'look', 'problem', 'try', 'deal', 'most', 'realistic', 'way', 'possible', 'never', 'offer', 'solution', 'offer', 'solution', 'problem', 'will', 'go', 'away', 'films', 'deal', 'topics', 'so', 'big', 'are', 'easy', 'solutions', 'Syriana', 'time', 'big', 'Oscar', 'campaigns', 'time', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'good', 'movies', 'could', 'definitely', 'see', 'few', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'coming', 'film', 'way', 'would', 'please', 'greatly', 'Christopher', 'Plumber', 'were', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Gaghan', 'Best', 'Screenplay', '.And', 'what', 'George', 'Clooney', 'be', 'year', 'First', 'writing', 'directing', 'exceptional', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'now', 'giving', 'quite', 'powerful', 'performance', 'here', 'Clooney', 'managed', 'turn', 'fan.But', 'are', 'things', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'editing', 'found', 'few', 'shots', 'unnecessary', 'times', 'disliked', 'cinematography', 'feel', 'biggest', 'downfall', 'film', 'never', 'get', 'really', 'understand', 'people', 'concerns', 'are', 'never', 'concerns', 'Gaghan', 'was', 'able', 'accomplish', 'Traffic', 'other', 'emsemble', 'films', 'released', 'year', 'also', 'succeeding', 'doing', 'so', 'Crash', 'instance', 'Syriana', 'so', 'much', 'many', 'times', 'viewer', 'feels', 'overwhelmed', 'feel', 'are', 'missing', 'something', 'are', 'playing', 'game', 'catch', 'up', 'distracting.Still', 'everything', 'Syriana', 'nicely', 'crafted', 'expertly', 'directed', 'well', 'acted', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'best', 'performance', 'realize', 'going', 'credits', 'not', 'saying', 'much', ""n't"", 'make', 'statement', 'less', 'true', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'truly', 'great', 'are', 'highly', 'emotional', 'real', 'Gaghan', 'notch', 'previous', 'film', 'Abandon', 'step', 'Traffic', 'still', 'great', 'deal', 'promise', 'things', 'come', 'Which', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'characters', 'movie.Bottom-line', 'Ambitious', 'grand-scale', 'film', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'cast', 'moments', 'where', 'shine', 'film', 'too', 'complex', 'really', 'follow', 'real', 'understanding', 'people', 'still', 'movie', 'time']",N/A
984657,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000F7CMRM,Alistair McHarg,"[23, 40]","George Clooney seems intent on educating us with films that aren't accurate enough to be documentaries or dramatic enough to be truthful.  In Good Night, And Good Luck he made one of the most truly horrifying chapters in American history, the McCarthy era, tepid and drab.  In Syriana, (star and executive producer), he blows the whistle on corruption in the oil biz.  (Who knew?)  Can a searing indictment of shady Hollywood accounting practices be far behind?Syriana is long and plotless, instead of structure or character development there's a maelstrom of plot-ettes which occasionally bump into each other and say, ""Excuse me.""  The cinematography is excellent, and it's fun to bounce from Langley to Beirut, Switzerland to luxury yachts in the Mediterranean.  But it doesn't add up to anything.  The net result is a feeling of being lost in a terribly intricate web, a network of people who have only one thing in common, they're all despicable.If nothing else, Syriana vividly reminds us that myopic greed is an equal opportunity employer that does not discriminate by race, religion, culture, gender, nationality, or any other artificial parameter people use to separate themselves from one another, and in so doing, sew the seeds of destruction for one and all.  Those who imagine our own country as somehow especially virtuous - and the sand dune strewn nation states we exhaust to propel our bloated SUVs as merely a necessary evil morally inferior to us - will have to look elsewhere to perpetuate their ludicrous prejudices.  In this respect Syriana is pretty compelling propaganda, and certainly needed.  However, propaganda is never art.The film is something of a cameo-fest, one gets the sense that lots of Hollywood liberals jumped on the bandwagon to lend support, but no character is developed fully enough to allow for a real performance.  Jeffrey Wright as Bennett Holiday comes closest, but even Clooney, hidden behind a nasty beard, offers no depth or feeling.  Matt Damon, true to form, gives yet another impression of a loaf of Wonderbread that has learned to talk, while William Hurt's obligatory stroll through the scenery is so lackluster that anything - finger puppets, PowerPoint slides, even a mime - would have been preferable.Watch it, then go fill up your Hummer.",3,Unctuously Anticipated,1157155200,"09 2, 2006",2006,2297,"['George', 'Clooney', 'intent', 'educating', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'accurate', 'enough', 'be', 'documentaries', 'dramatic', 'enough', 'be', 'truthful', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'made', 'one', 'most', 'truly', 'horrifying', 'chapters', 'American', 'history', 'McCarthy', 'era', 'tepid', 'drab', 'Syriana', 'star', 'executive', 'producer', 'whistle', 'corruption', 'oil', 'biz', 'Who', 'knew', 'Can', 'searing', 'indictment', 'shady', 'Hollywood', 'accounting', 'practices', 'be', 'far', 'Syriana', 'long', 'plotless', 'instead', 'structure', 'character', 'development', 'maelstrom', 'plot-ettes', 'occasionally', 'bump', 'other', 'say', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'fun', 'bounce', 'Langley', 'Beirut', 'Switzerland', 'luxury', 'yachts', 'Mediterranean', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'anything', 'net', 'result', 'feeling', 'being', 'lost', 'terribly', 'intricate', 'web', 'network', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'common', ""'re"", 'despicable.If', 'nothing', 'else', 'Syriana', 'vividly', 'myopic', 'greed', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'employer', 'not', 'discriminate', 'race', 'religion', 'culture', 'gender', 'nationality', 'other', 'artificial', 'parameter', 'people', 'use', 'separate', 'one', 'so', 'doing', 'sew', 'seeds', 'destruction', 'one', 'who', 'imagine', 'own', 'country', 'somehow', 'especially', 'virtuous', 'sand', 'dune', 'strewn', 'nation', 'exhaust', 'propel', 'bloated', 'SUVs', 'merely', 'necessary', 'evil', 'morally', 'inferior', 'will', 'have', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'perpetuate', 'ludicrous', 'prejudices', 'respect', 'Syriana', 'pretty', 'compelling', 'propaganda', 'certainly', 'needed', 'However', 'propaganda', 'never', 'art.The', 'film', 'something', 'cameo-fest', 'one', 'sense', 'lots', 'Hollywood', 'liberals', 'jumped', 'bandwagon', 'lend', 'support', 'character', 'developed', 'fully', 'enough', 'allow', 'real', 'performance', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'Bennett', 'Holiday', 'closest', 'even', 'Clooney', 'hidden', 'nasty', 'beard', 'depth', 'feeling', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'true', 'form', 'yet', 'impression', 'loaf', 'Wonderbread', 'learned', 'talk', 'William', 'Hurt', 'obligatory', 'stroll', 'scenery', 'so', 'lackluster', 'anything', 'finger', 'puppets', 'PowerPoint', 'even', 'mime', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'preferable.Watch', 'then', 'go', 'fill', 'up', 'Hummer']",N/A

The center of the plot, the fight between the Sheik's two sons to inherit his kingdom, is clearly set in Saudi Arabia, but the movie was filmed in Dubai, UAE.  The conspiracy -- if you want to call it that -- among big oil, the US intelligence community and the rulers of oil-rich nations asks serious and sometimes tragic questions.  ** SPOILERS FROM HERE ON **Politics aside, this is a good foreign-espionage film to watch although some of the metaphors are a little too earnest:  the same local workers in Pseudo Arabia who are dumped by a big American oil company about to merge with another, quickly are transfomed by the film into students of militant Islam.  Okay, we get the irony!In a related subplot, Matt Damon plays an American TV business reporer who apparently cannot speak Arabic and has a surprisingly poor take on local politics: he wastes time chatting on the cell phone right near the steps where a critical speech is being made, revealing how little he knows about the Sheik's son's politics: ""His private plane is great!""Earlier in the film, he and wife (Amanda Peet) witness their six-year-old son's accidental electrocution due to a faulty underwater pool light that was energized when the lights were turned on at a chic Arab-American party set in probably what is meant to indicate Riyadh.  To Damon, a rich oil city such as Riyadh or coastal Dubai looks so Houstonian with its air-conditioning, freeways, Euro-American food and strip malls, that he is allowed to sail through this film with blockheaded complacency intact.  (To be fair, his wife gets the idea after her first son's electrocution and flies back to the States with their toddler.)I'm not sure why we the audience got clobbered with this plot turn, but the message registers to us, if not to Damon's character, that things only LOOK the same in the Mideast as in the USA, but aren't the same underneath.So let your conscience be your guide on buying this DVD at a bargain price.

We see men and women, across the board of nationalities and economic levels and governmental levels, coming together to get their own piece of the pie.  Or should I say bite of the apple?  None of the main characters are to be lauded though some pass the test at the end more than others (such as the fact when Matt Damon's character returns to his wife and child or when George Clooney's character ties but fails to stop an assassination).

Idolatry.  Simply idolatry when you do because we are not a perfect people and even the most spotless of us, as this movie shows, holds some dirt under the rug.  You need to watch this movie and then go back to your FOX news because it helps you to start thinking of what goes on behind the scenes of the world today.

Good, yes, but by no means great.In brief, ""Syriana"" covers several loosely related plots that all ultimately reveal the corruption that is Middle East politics.  The corrupt, the venal and the incompetent seem to win out over honesty and integrity.  It is big oil and the US government and their lackeys that triumph.  It is democracy and transparency that is denied.The cast of ""Syriana"" is a true ensemble with stars such as George Clooney and Matt Damon on hand to provide pulling power.  Each actor and their characters are plausible and, at the end of the day, the plot itself is credible.  No one could suggest that Middle East politics is free of the taint of corruption.  Indeed, short of eastern Europe during the cold war or most of Africa today, few examples of corruption could exceed that on hand in the Persian Gulf and its environs.Perhaps the weakest aspect of the film is that it labours its points.  This is not to suggest, as some may, that this is a film with a left wing or anti American bias.  America and others have been up to their eye balls in the politics of the Middle East for over a century.  However, this point, when continuously made, can tire in time.See this film as it does have a contribution to make to any discussion of the Middle East.

Dobrow ""Career Writer""","[4, 7]","When an audience member goes to a theater to watch a movie,they are interested in viewing a film that will expand their mind, make them laugh, or to draw some sort of emotional reaction. Not a movie that requires them to know the ins and outs of the Middle East 's political relationships with the U.S. That's not what people want...but that's what they are going to get with Syriana.Syriana is basically a somewhat comprehensive look at the inner workings of the corruption and relationships that live within the relations of the Middle East and America concerning Energy/Oil. I say somewhat because the movie does a pretty crappy job displaying any true meaning or agenda. There are far too many characters and far to many plot lines going on at once, which seemed at some points to be reaching for a goal that it just couldn't reach. With almost no character development and no background information, the script comes up far short of my expectations.As far as the acting goes, George Clooney was by far the standout actor in a main role. His newly bearded mug and pudgy gut was proof that there are some actors willing to still make sacrifices for a role that they care about. Matt Damon, on the other hand, was not even working at a moderately believable rate. Damon seemed so uninterested and and uncomfortable in his role, that it made me feel both uninterested and uncomfortable with his role. One actor I was truly impressed with though was Alexander Siddig, who plays Prince Nasir Al-Subaai, which turns out to be a pretty minor character. Even with his lack of screen time I consider him to have acted the best role of the cast.My favorite aspect of the film would have to be the cinematography. It's not even that the camera work is that spectacular. It's the fact that everything else about the film had such complex nuances and unspoken reasonings, that the camera work was the only solid piece of understandable styling. The climax of the film comes considerably late in the movie, but by that time, because of the utter emotional detachment that the script emits, there is really no feelings towards the characters. Everyone is a antagonist in their own way in this film, which makes it pretty hard to truly care about anyones well-being.I believe that there is a good movie buried somewhere within the ideas of Syriana. The saddest moment about this movie is the moment you realize of how ground-breaking a film of this theme could have been. I guess when you think about it, any film can be turned into something better. It's just a matter of putting a certain amount of emotional interest in the movie. Syriana was not directed write, or acted write, or even written right, but the potential is still there. George Clooney may of won the Oscar Award for best supporting actor for his role, but I still think Paul Giamatti was robbed.3.25/5",3,Corruption Is Why We Win,1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,2858,"['When', 'audience', 'member', 'theater', 'watch', 'movie', 'are', 'interested', 'viewing', 'film', 'will', 'expand', 'mind', 'make', 'laugh', 'draw', 'sort', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'Not', 'movie', 'know', 'ins', 'outs', 'Middle', 'East', 'political', 'relationships', 'U.S.', 'That', 'not', 'what', 'people', 'want', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'Syriana.Syriana', 'basically', 'somewhat', 'comprehensive', 'look', 'inner', 'workings', 'corruption', 'relationships', 'live', 'relations', 'Middle', 'East', 'America', 'concerning', 'Energy/Oil', 'say', 'somewhat', 'movie', 'pretty', 'crappy', 'job', 'displaying', 'true', 'meaning', 'agenda', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'far', 'many', 'plot', 'lines', 'going', 'once', 'seemed', 'points', 'be', 'reaching', 'goal', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'reach', 'almost', 'character', 'development', 'background', 'information', 'script', 'up', 'far', 'short', 'expectations.As', 'far', 'acting', 'George', 'Clooney', 'was', 'far', 'standout', 'actor', 'main', 'role', 'newly', 'bearded', 'mug', 'pudgy', 'gut', 'was', 'proof', 'are', 'actors', 'willing', 'still', 'make', 'sacrifices', 'role', 'care', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'working', 'moderately', 'believable', 'rate', 'Damon', 'seemed', 'so', 'uninterested', 'uncomfortable', 'role', 'made', 'feel', 'uninterested', 'uncomfortable', 'role', 'One', 'actor', 'was', 'truly', 'impressed', 'though', 'was', 'Alexander', 'Siddig', 'who', 'Prince', 'Nasir', 'Al-Subaai', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'minor', 'character', 'Even', 'lack', 'screen', 'time', 'consider', 'have', 'acted', 'best', 'role', 'cast.My', 'favorite', 'aspect', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'cinematography', 'not', 'even', 'camera', 'work', 'spectacular', 'fact', 'everything', 'else', 'film', 'had', 'such', 'complex', 'nuances', 'unspoken', 'reasonings', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'only', 'solid', 'piece', 'understandable', 'styling', 'climax', 'film', 'considerably', 'late', 'movie', 'time', 'utter', 'emotional', 'detachment', 'script', 'really', 'feelings', 'characters', 'Everyone', 'antagonist', 'own', 'way', 'film', 'pretty', 'hard', 'truly', 'care', 'anyones', 'well-being.I', 'believe', 'good', 'movie', 'buried', 'somewhere', 'ideas', 'Syriana', 'saddest', 'moment', 'movie', 'moment', 'realize', 'how', 'ground-breaking', 'film', 'theme', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'guess', 'when', 'think', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'something', 'better', 'just', 'matter', 'putting', 'certain', 'amount', 'emotional', 'interest', 'movie', 'Syriana', 'was', 'not', 'directed', 'write', 'acted', 'write', 'even', 'written', 'right', 'potential', 'still', 'there', 'George', 'Clooney', 'may', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Award', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'role', 'still', 'think', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'was', 'robbed.3.25/5']",N/A

984667,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B000F7CMRM,Anton Ilinski,"[8, 9]","""Syriana"" is one of those seemingly long and boring films that has so many layers and subplots you have to really desire to see them all. It's one of those films you got to use your brain to fully appreciate it, it's no cheap entertainment. Most of good political thrillers are like this, and I'm really talking only about good ones.And I have to say ""Syriana"" is truly frightening picture. Well, we all know the world is run by a bunch of rich guys and a bunch of wannabe rich guys whose lack of funds is compensated by their connections and authority. But in a daily routine we usually forget about global problems and when reminded by means of films like ""Syriana"" it frightens. I feel a bit uneasy about living in such a world.It's useless to talk about the story line since it's very complex and consists of many layers as I already said. In a few words I can say the picture is about nowdays' political and economical situation in the world where everything is based on one thing - oil. Everyone is interested in it - big concerns hence big influential politicians hence big services like CIA. This vicious circle sucks in many people in ""Syriana"": idialistic Gulf prince and his family - emir father and soon-to-become-emir brother, a CIA life-beaten operative who has to eliminate the prince, a young oil-broker, who's into energetics, and his whole family which is rather far from all these problems, a corporate lawyer dealing with two major U.S. oil companies, and a Pakistani boy who's out of despair joins a radical islamic organization and is being prepared for a suicide bombing raid.Oil affects them all in some way spinning this story into a vortex of tragedies, deceptions, money and power. All these people playing roles of small particles in a giant engine have no idea that their every action will have a great impact on today's world, that their every word will have maybe fatal consequences. And since this story only pretends its characters and events are fictitious, it makes me rather sad - ""Syriana"" is a reminder we are living in a place everything is very far from being quiet and peaceful.""Syriana's"" narration seems pretty ragged and that's for a reason. All its characters look like they don't have anything to do with each other and everyone has his own story. But if to look at the film from some distance it's getting clear they all are like small parts of a giant puzzle.

984668,ARA48345JZPZR,B000F7CMRM,Archmaker,"[7, 12]","Stephen Gaghan has undertaken a difficult task in trying to tell the tale of the International Oil trade.  It is a tale spanning continents, with players in and out of business and government.  It is the nexus for corruption and terrorism and it underlies most everything in our daily lives.  It is a story too big for one picture, and this picture can't tell it all.  But it is an admirable and intriguing effort.  And it isn't a pretty picture.As all will point out, this is a movie told in a complex and convoluted narrative.  It is not a feel good, what-me-worry entertainment.  You stand warned.  But for the discerning and patient viewer, this dark tale's various strands will all weave together to a comprehensible, albeit inconclusive resolution.  Along the way, dirty deeds are done and good soldiers are sold out.  As ever.Big Oil means Big Business, Big Money, Big Government, Big Intrigue.  Any commodity generating this kind of wealth means that every sort of corruption and greed and treachery can be found in and around it and trailing in its wake.  Like the drug trade (Gaghan's last subject in Traffic), there is so much money floating around that it inevitably will besmirch the Hallowed Halls of Power in DC, Corporate Boardrooms, and sanctified Law firms.  And this is a commodity the world runs on.So has Gaghan told us the truth?  Much of it, I'm sure, is spot on. But it is fragments of observation, with Gaghan's overall view muddled. I was a little disappointed in a bit too much emphasis on America as villain.  To paraphrase my favorite line about the corruptions we all face in the real world (from Chinatown)""we swim in the same waters as everyone else"".  Gaghan didn't seem to see realize his film comes off this way when I saw him on Charlie Rose.  He stated that he thought American companies were a might cleaner in their practices than some of the European and Asian companies. Not to mention all the countries concerned. In short, we didn't invent ruthless.I would recommend you set aside your political biases and enjoy a film that takes us into worlds most of us will never see, and probably would just as soon not know about.  The truth of what this commodity, this driving force, has meant to our lives was brought shockingly home to us all a few years ago.  It is the driving force behind our politics and policies today. It finances our enemies.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[7, 10]","I felt lost in Syriana, as if I were a small rat in a huge maze.Told through multiple storylines, the film's focus is on oil addiction and how it affects everyone connected with it, from the hardworking Persians in the oil fields to the glutenously rich Sheiks and American tycoons. The bad thing about Syriana is that the message stands out more than the film or -- unfortunately -- its characters. It's a valid message that we need to (must!) hear. We live in a global economy and that economy directly influences other nations. From Russia to China and Iran to the U.S., each action one takes will send waves through the other.Murder and pushing business are co-mingled in Syriana as we see Bob (George Clooney plus 30 pounds) working for the CIA in the Persian Gulf region. He's never asked why he does what he does. He simply knows that he's doing it for the good of his country. But when the U.S. turns its back on Bob, he has to make a decision, and it's something that will change the course of his life.Interspersed with Bob's actions are others whose deeds end up causing deadly results. No fingers are pointed at anyone being at fault for this (one of the big bonuses of the movie), and it is this that pulls the viewer into the story. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) plays an attorney searching for a way to make a large oil company merger happen without attracting legal problems. His hard work and initial goodness are muddled by the end as he discovers what he has to do in order to affect such a merger.Byran Woodman (Matt Damon) is a high level financial advisor for corporate America who loses his son to an accident (?) at an Arab/American party, only to be sucked into the lives of the people responsible for his son's death.There are at least three other side-stories going on, but I'm not going to bother with them for one simple reason: they're too damn confusing! And that's the big downside to Syriana. It tries to make too many connections in too short a time. Several times I had to stop and ask myself, ""Now what does this guy/gal have to do with the story again?"" I'm a pretty astute viewer but several of these characters' purposes went beyond my threshold of understanding. For instance, Danny Dalton is played by Tim Blake Nelson (Oh Brother Where Art Thou), but I have no idea what his purpose was in the film. He's got maybe two minutes of screen-time and that's it. And Jeffrey Wright's character (Bennett Holiday) has what I think is a father waiting for him when he gets dropped off at his house and they have some sort of angry altercation for completely unknown reasons. And Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) plays a powerful political figure but how, why, and where he flexes this muscle is never shown nor explained.Making people connections on film is fun and a basic requirement for enjoyable cinematic experiences. But if you overload your audience with these connections, the whole can seem like a bramble of fractured stories that never come to fruition. And that's certainly the way I felt when I saw Syriana.So why the positive review?

Several story threads ultimately come together in a somewhat grey tale of corruption, at both the corporate and the government levels. This is a moral tale about how far down the dark path the country has gone to feed its addiction to oil, as a nation with only a small fraction of the globe's population, but a huge percentage of global oil consumption.

Partly, because it touches on the subjects of oil, corruption and the evil of the middle east that has always been portrayed in a very American way in the past.  And yes, the movie can be confusing and yes, the movie also has a very American take on its themes.  Nevertheless, it is is worth watching.The movie is shot in very quick scenes that allow the viewer to ""drop in"" on whatever is going on.  There is not much fuzz about setting up the scene or introducing the characters, of which there are many.  Instead, the viewer is launched into a multi-dimensional plot line with various characters intersecting at single or multiple moments.  It is almost like a puzzle, where the more pieces are put together, the puzzle master is slowly able to envision the whole picture.  True, this movie takes patience and demands attention, but those are requests that usually are forgotten in the average American Hollywood movie these days.  The acting is excellent with George Cloony, who won an Academy Award and Golden Globe for his role, leading a fabulous cast.The themes of the movie are current.  Weapons are sold in the Middle East and no one knows who ends up owning them.  Oil companies merge and with the merge comes the loss of jobs for foreign workers.  Immigration issues and the lack of work allows militant terrorist groups disguised as a religious sect to order young men into suicide.  The quest to move a country that is ruled by a king to a democratic government fails because there is no benefit in this advance for some of the ruling countries in the world.  The need for men to make themselves even richer drives them to corruption.  The lines are blurry and it is not often clear who the good guys are.  In some cases, what is intended as good becomes evil.  Moral is questioned, as well as what drives the economy and our social wealth.  Is America supportive of one country's  liberation even if that means oil prices will rise?Don't expect answers to all of your questions and don't expect an easy solution.  This is a complex movie that looks at a complex set of problems.  It is also an American movie and thus, some of the portrayals of immigrant and terrorist issues may be one-sided.  However, what this movie excels at is questioning as to what the relationship is between the Middle East, the oil business, weapon trading and terrorist activities.

984686,A1YYBC3O7KHQKK,B000F7CMRM,Carter,"[5, 5]","I was dissuaded from reviewing this film for years because a very large amazon jury had already reached its verdict. But continuing to bite my lip is difficult, because Syriana's message is as timely and important in 2011, perhaps more so, as when it was released in 2005.  And because, contrary to the many criticisms, Syriana is a patently amazing film--engaging, insightful, and passionate.  It offers a brilliant snapshot of the complexities of politics and energy, and the fallout from them, that fill our headlines everyday and challenge our security.  Many reviewers say, principally, that the story is unclear and confusing.  Let me suggest another view.  Most of the story's subjects are difficult to understand in the U.S. and elsewhere in the west where there is a predominant belief system that impedes understanding--a belief system about the way America acts in the world, about the motives of far-away people in far-away lands, and about the consequences of American actions for those far-away lives as well as for our own.  The amazon reviewer is spot on when he asks if viewers have the courage to watch this film. It takes courage to let go of long-held preconceptions.  Films like Syriana are far and few between that ask viewers, even if only momentarily, to relinquish portions of their belief system.  Those films are courageous, just as are viewers ready for the journey.What is so beautiful about Syrian is that, for the viewer ready for an intellectual reckoning, the film handsomely rewards.  Long-frustrating puzzles are solved, and long-standing obfuscations are shattered into simple truths about decency and profligacy, about provocation and retribution.  This difficult transformative experience complete, Syriana becomes clear:  There is a partnership between oil and government which has consequences for both Americans and those living in oil-producing countries.  Especially in the Middle East, the consequences involve the persistence of autocratic government.  Persistent illegitimate government has consequences on the attitudes of simple and ordinary people who live unhappily under an oppressive system.  Over time, among these people and their supporters in the diaspora, there is an inevitable transformation from attitudes of resignation and acceptance of the status quo to defiance and then militancy against regional sovereigns and their western and US backers.  Syriana's main thesis is one of devastating consequence.  The current Middle East political and economic status quo is unsustainable when too many people believe they have no stake in it.  War, foreign meddling, corruption, and oppressive governments produce humiliation, wide-spread anti-Americanism/anti-Westernism, and finally violence--in the region, here in the U.S., and globally.Syriana, far from going ""everywhere and nowhere,"" goes somewhere most assuredly.  It bravely tells its drama coherently and logically, if not linearly.  Ambitious is not a strong enough word to describe writer/director Stephen Gaghan's effort to tie his thesis and multiple story-lines together into a cohesive and themed story for our times that also happens to entertain, delivering action and punch.  All the more astonishing that he wrote his screenplay by the age of 30 and then went on to direct a stellar ensemble cast. The story may be complex, but, rest assured, it can be unraveled, and it has consequences for all of us here and now.  Some may not be ready to hear Syriana's sobering message, but be courageous enough to consider the possibilities.",5,Consider the Possibilities,1317686400,"10 4, 2011",2011,3553,"['was', 'dissuaded', 'reviewing', 'film', 'years', 'very', 'large', 'amazon', 'jury', 'had', 'already', 'reached', 'verdict', 'continuing', 'bite', 'lip', 'difficult', 'Syriana', 'message', 'timely', 'important', '2011', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'was', 'released', '2005', 'contrary', 'many', 'criticisms', 'Syriana', 'patently', 'amazing', 'film', 'engaging', 'insightful', 'passionate', 'brilliant', 'snapshot', 'complexities', 'politics', 'energy', 'fallout', 'headlines', 'everyday', 'challenge', 'security', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'say', 'principally', 'story', 'unclear', 'confusing', 'Let', 'suggest', 'view', 'Most', 'story', 'subjects', 'are', 'difficult', 'understand', 'U.S.', 'elsewhere', 'west', 'where', 'predominant', 'belief', 'system', 'understanding', 'belief', 'system', 'way', 'America', 'world', 'motives', 'far-away', 'people', 'far-away', 'lands', 'consequences', 'American', 'actions', 'far-away', 'lives', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'amazon', 'reviewer', 'spot', 'when', 'viewers', 'have', 'courage', 'watch', 'film', 'courage', 'let', 'go', 'long-held', 'preconceptions', 'Films', 'Syriana', 'are', 'far', 'few', 'ask', 'viewers', 'even', 'only', 'momentarily', 'relinquish', 'portions', 'belief', 'system', 'films', 'are', 'courageous', 'just', 'are', 'viewers', 'ready', 'journey.What', 'so', 'beautiful', 'Syrian', 'viewer', 'ready', 'intellectual', 'reckoning', 'film', 'handsomely', 'rewards', 'Long-frustrating', 'puzzles', 'are', 'solved', 'long-standing', 'obfuscations', 'are', 'shattered', 'simple', 'truths', 'decency', 'profligacy', 'provocation', 'retribution', 'difficult', 'transformative', 'experience', 'complete', 'Syriana', 'clear', 'partnership', 'oil', 'government', 'consequences', 'Americans', 'living', 'oil-producing', 'countries', 'Especially', 'Middle', 'East', 'consequences', 'involve', 'persistence', 'autocratic', 'government', 'Persistent', 'illegitimate', 'government', 'consequences', 'attitudes', 'simple', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'unhappily', 'oppressive', 'system', 'time', 'people', 'supporters', 'diaspora', 'inevitable', 'transformation', 'attitudes', 'resignation', 'acceptance', 'status', 'quo', 'defiance', 'then', 'militancy', 'regional', 'sovereigns', 'western', 'US', 'backers', 'Syriana', 'main', 'thesis', 'one', 'devastating', 'consequence', 'current', 'Middle', 'East', 'political', 'economic', 'status', 'quo', 'unsustainable', 'when', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'believe', 'have', 'stake', 'War', 'foreign', 'meddling', 'corruption', 'oppressive', 'governments', 'produce', 'humiliation', 'wide-spread', 'anti-Americanism/anti-Westernism', 'finally', 'violence', 'region', 'here', 'U.S.', 'globally.Syriana', 'far', 'going', 'everywhere', 'nowhere', 'somewhere', 'most', 'assuredly', 'bravely', 'drama', 'coherently', 'logically', 'not', 'linearly', 'Ambitious', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'word', 'describe', 'writer/director', 'Stephen', 'Gaghan', 'effort', 'tie', 'thesis', 'multiple', 'story-lines', 'together', 'cohesive', 'themed', 'story', 'times', 'also', 'entertain', 'delivering', 'action', 'punch', 'more', 'astonishing', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'age', '30', 'then', 'went', 'direct', 'stellar', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'complex', 'rest', 'assured', 'can', 'be', 'unraveled', 'consequences', 'here', 'now', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'ready', 'hear', 'Syriana', 'sobering', 'message', 'be', 'courageous', 'enough', 'consider', 'possibilities']",N/A

984688,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000F7CMRM,C. B Collins Jr.,"[6, 9]","This films has several real strengths and thus is very suspenceful and thoughtful. I found two major strengths to the film, the method of allowing multiple story lines to develop and converge gradually while withholding information from the viewer so that the viewer is continually trying to figure out the plot. I will discuss those two strengths below and then I will end this review with a discussion of the weakest link in the chain, which is some of the conceptualization around the role of the United States in the international arena and the means by which US agencies will ensure that the US corporate interests are protected.First, the film used the technique of truncating activities and  dialogue that would clue the viewer into the full scheme or plot of the film. For example, banker Christopher Plummer asks the youngest son of an Arabian state what he 'wants'. We never hear the answer. Only later do we learn that he wishes to be king which means disposal of his older brother. Thus the viewer must be on their toes during the entire film, trying to piece together the various plot lines of the film.Second, the acting was superb with wonderful performances by Clooney who does a wonderful job of gradually becoming enraged by his employer - the CIA, Alexander Siggig as the idealistic and realistic eldest son of the Arabian king wishing to break from US influence over his father and his country, Jeffrey Wright as a lawyer investigating his own client's from the outside to determine if the Justice Department can uncover wrong doing in the major oil industries, Chris Cooper as an outspoken Texas Oil man, Christopher Plummer as the senior partner of a powerful Washington law firm that actually tells the CIA whom to assasinate, and Matt Damon as a stock specialist who befriends the young Arabian Prince and begins to serve as his financial advisor.However a carefully written and directed script and a great cast of actors does not necessarily make this a great film (a score of 5). The film is based on the premise that world wide petroleum supplies are drying up at a time when the Chinese demand for oil is increasing exponentially (which is true). Thus, it is in the best interest for the United States to control oil producing countries at all costs so that oil continues to flow to the USA un-interrupted (maybe true). Major oil corporations thus are able to command considerable political power and are able to influence the governement agencies to support their business enterprise (probably true). Therefore, when an Arab Prince decides to sign a contract with the Chinese for sale of oil and to cancel contracts with US defense contractors for overpriced weapons systems, the CIA actually asasinates this Prince at the bidding of the US oil giants as communicated through their power broker Washington attorney (very improbable and very doubtful). Of course the film is fiction and should be rated and reviewed as fiction, but many viewers may feel the film went one step too far when it indicates the CIA practices asasination at the request of the oil industry.Many entertaining aspects of the film rung very true - such as Hezbollah requiring approval of a CIA agent before they are allowed to operate in Lebannon as well as CIA bureaucrats practicing spin control when an agent is captured trying to asassinate an oil Prince. The most fascinating story line in the entire film was not the asasination story line which many reviewers found to be unrealistic, or the tragic Matt Damon storyline where his young son gets electrocuted at a swimming party, but rather the wonderful Jeffrey Wright storyline where an African American lawyer is asked to investigate the powerful clients of his law firm to find out the 'dirty laundry' before the US Justice Department finds any smoking guns. Wright not only finds the dirty laundry, but he negotiates giving up the unlucky small fry crooks with the Justice Department so that the major big boy corporate heads can continue to control world oil supplies with the assistance of US agencies for a gas guzzling nation of SUV drivers.The far right will hate this film. The far left will love it. Whatever, it is thoughtful entertainment that does challenge the viewer to take a stand as to what they believe the role of the US should be in regard to protecting America's interest in oil consumption.",4,"Suspenceful, thoughtful, tightly composed entertainment",1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,4374,"['films', 'several', 'real', 'strengths', 'thus', 'very', 'suspenceful', 'thoughtful', 'found', 'two', 'major', 'strengths', 'film', 'method', 'allowing', 'multiple', 'story', 'lines', 'develop', 'converge', 'gradually', 'withholding', 'information', 'viewer', 'viewer', 'continually', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'plot', 'will', 'discuss', 'two', 'strengths', 'then', 'will', 'end', 'review', 'discussion', 'weakest', 'link', 'chain', 'conceptualization', 'role', 'United', 'States', 'international', 'arena', 'means', 'US', 'agencies', 'will', 'ensure', 'US', 'corporate', 'interests', 'are', 'protected.First', 'film', 'used', 'technique', 'truncating', 'activities', 'dialogue', 'would', 'clue', 'viewer', 'full', 'scheme', 'plot', 'film', 'example', 'banker', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'youngest', 'son', 'Arabian', 'state', 'what', 'never', 'hear', 'answer', 'Only', 'later', 'do', 'learn', 'be', 'king', 'disposal', 'older', 'brother', 'Thus', 'viewer', 'must', 'be', 'toes', 'entire', 'film', 'trying', 'piece', 'together', 'various', 'plot', 'lines', 'film.Second', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Clooney', 'who', 'wonderful', 'job', 'gradually', 'becoming', 'enraged', 'employer', 'CIA', 'Alexander', 'Siggig', 'idealistic', 'realistic', 'eldest', 'son', 'Arabian', 'king', 'wishing', 'break', 'US', 'influence', 'father', 'country', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'lawyer', 'investigating', 'own', 'client', 'outside', 'determine', 'Justice', 'Department', 'can', 'uncover', 'wrong', 'doing', 'major', 'oil', 'industries', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'outspoken', 'Texas', 'Oil', 'man', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'senior', 'partner', 'powerful', 'Washington', 'law', 'firm', 'actually', 'CIA', 'whom', 'assasinate', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'stock', 'specialist', 'who', 'young', 'Arabian', 'Prince', 'serve', 'financial', 'advisor.However', 'carefully', 'written', 'directed', 'script', 'great', 'cast', 'actors', 'not', 'necessarily', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'score', '5', 'film', 'based', 'premise', 'world', 'wide', 'petroleum', 'supplies', 'are', 'drying', 'up', 'time', 'when', 'Chinese', 'demand', 'oil', 'increasing', 'exponentially', 'true', 'Thus', 'best', 'interest', 'United', 'States', 'control', 'oil', 'producing', 'countries', 'costs', 'oil', 'flow', 'USA', 'un-interrupted', 'maybe', 'true', 'Major', 'oil', 'corporations', 'thus', 'are', 'able', 'command', 'considerable', 'political', 'power', 'are', 'able', 'influence', 'governement', 'agencies', 'support', 'business', 'enterprise', 'probably', 'true', 'Therefore', 'when', 'Arab', 'Prince', 'sign', 'contract', 'Chinese', 'sale', 'oil', 'cancel', 'contracts', 'US', 'defense', 'contractors', 'overpriced', 'weapons', 'systems', 'CIA', 'actually', 'Prince', 'bidding', 'US', 'oil', 'giants', 'communicated', 'power', 'broker', 'Washington', 'attorney', 'very', 'improbable', 'very', 'doubtful', 'course', 'film', 'fiction', 'should', 'be', 'rated', 'reviewed', 'fiction', 'many', 'viewers', 'may', 'feel', 'film', 'went', 'one', 'step', 'too', 'far', 'when', 'CIA', 'practices', 'asasination', 'request', 'oil', 'industry.Many', 'entertaining', 'aspects', 'film', 'rung', 'very', 'true', 'such', 'Hezbollah', 'requiring', 'approval', 'CIA', 'agent', 'are', 'allowed', 'operate', 'Lebannon', 'as', 'well', 'CIA', 'bureaucrats', 'practicing', 'spin', 'control', 'when', 'agent', 'captured', 'trying', 'asassinate', 'oil', 'Prince', 'most', 'fascinating', 'story', 'line', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'asasination', 'story', 'line', 'many', 'reviewers', 'found', 'be', 'unrealistic', 'tragic', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'storyline', 'where', 'young', 'son', 'electrocuted', 'swimming', 'party', 'rather', 'wonderful', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'storyline', 'where', 'African', 'American', 'lawyer', 'asked', 'investigate', 'powerful', 'clients', 'law', 'firm', 'find', 'out', ""'dirty"", 'laundry', 'US', 'Justice', 'Department', 'smoking', 'guns', 'Wright', 'not', 'only', 'dirty', 'laundry', 'giving', 'up', 'unlucky', 'small', 'fry', 'crooks', 'Justice', 'Department', 'major', 'big', 'boy', 'corporate', 'heads', 'can', 'continue', 'control', 'world', 'oil', 'supplies', 'assistance', 'US', 'agencies', 'gas', 'guzzling', 'nation', 'SUV', 'drivers.The', 'far', 'right', 'will', 'hate', 'film', 'far', 'left', 'will', 'love', 'thoughtful', 'entertainment', 'challenge', 'viewer', 'take', 'stand', 'what', 'believe', 'role', 'US', 'should', 'be', 'regard', 'protecting', 'America', 'interest', 'oil', 'consumption']",N/A

It also reminded me in format of the BBC series of Traffik (better than the movie, which I liked too) and the style of The Conversation. These days, because of the unimaginable gaul and stupidity being practiced today by all sorts of leaders and followers, many of us oridinary earthlings wish we had had ourselves knocked senseless and kept in a coma until it gets better.This movie is very sobering to say the least.  However, in a mere 2 hours, it illustrates the complexity of all the manure hitting the fan and where it sticks.  We feel like Michael Corleone kissing Fredo. Through excellent writing, directing, international casting, and technical production from 2 years ago, it portends the humanitarian mess in the world today. The characters are so clearly yet economically written. Also, the music and photography engage and entertain our senses.  The Harry Limes in this movie don't fall too far from the tree.  There are no speeches about kookoo clocks, but there are thoughtful and passionate conversations and actions that explain motivations.  You have to pay attention, but Syriana makes it easy.Mistakenly, I thought I had to be ready to watch this movie because of the strong topic.  This movie is so beautiful and strong that I could have watched it almost anytime.  It is a tonic.  It succeeds at doing what all great pieces of art do - keeps you thinking and hoping and exercising every braincell to find answers for a better world.  Because the writing is so clean and the subject so global, the beauty of it is that it can be dubbed or subtitled easily in any language.  With the shortage of effective diplomacy, Syriana speaks for those of us who feel our voice is being muffled by self-absorbed players. Here is hoping saner minds see this movie and understand that good people can contribute and help other good people make existance on Earth humane and healthy.

984699,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000F7CMRM,Craig Matteson,"[4, 7]","Frankly, the blatherings of many of the stars of this movie put me off seeing it, but I am now glad that I did.  It is a pretty darn good flick, as long as you don't take it too seriously.  I mean if you think that ""Marathon Man"" is a serious treatment of the Cold War, McCarthyism, Nazi Hunters, and the life and times of Josef Mengele after the war, well, then you might be forgiven for thinking that this movie has much to do with how the present world actually works.  However, as a fiction, it holds one's attention pretty well.Part of the way it draws us in is the way it starts with a bunch of clearly disconnected parts that we don't even understand.  Slowly, the film draws these pieces together and we wonder how they will come together.  Will it be a nice fit or will it be a collision of sorts?  There are plenty of side plots and sub plots to keep us trying to find the best angle into the plot.  If you want your stories told in a simple narrative, you will not enjoy this movie at all.  But if you like to puzzle things out as you watch, this one is a lot of fun.Be warned, however, that if you don't want to see a world full of bad guys, I mean everywhere; this is not a film you will enjoy.  It is LeCarre dark towards the U.S., Big Business, Terrorists (although they are treated as responding to the oppression of the West - yeah, right), and even dynastic passage.  Of course, history teaches us that brothers vying for their father's throne will sometime go quite far.

Bush's presidency it is a wealth of politically and socially-minded art in response to his unpopular regime. Leading the charge, in Hollywood at least, is George Clooney who has positioned himself as a vocal liberal celebrity with two high profile movies in 2005: Good Night, and Good Luck and Syriana. The latter film was written and directed by Stephen Gaghan, who wrote the screenplay for Steven Soderbergh's Traffic, and was loosely based on Robert Baer's memoir of his days as a CIA operative in the Middle East, See No Evil.Structurally, Syriana follows the same template as Traffic with several subplots structured in a non-linear fashion but containing more layers and complexities.In the little screen time he has early on, Clooney does an excellent job showing the rusty compass that his character lives his life by. The actor has improved and refined himself with every subsequent role and relies more and more on what is going on behind his eyes than falling back on his good looks. His performance in Syriana goes beyond the obvious Method trappings - the weight gain and the thick beard - to his expressive eyes and how he uses them to convey Barnes' world-weariness.Gaghan's direction reflects the stories in the movie. Everything isn't spelled out. There are a lot of gray areas with morally and ethically ambiguous characters whose motivations aren't entirely clear. If, at times, it is hard to follow all of the characters in this film it is done on purpose to illustrate just how hard it is to keep track of all the players in the Middle East oil trade and their numerous alliances, both obvious and secretive, with corporations and governments. Trying to make sense of it all can be a confusing and frustrating experience.""A Conversation with George Clooney."" The actor feels that Syriana is designed like the films from the 1970s that examined geopolitics. He talks about Robert Baer, the man that his character is loosely based on, and what he learned from talking to him.""Make A Change, Make A Difference"" isn't really a making of featurette but rather the cast talking about the subject matter of the movie. Clooney and Damon speak about their passion for the material and how they felt that here was a project that actually had something to say about how our world works.Also included are three deleted scenes that feature footage with Barnes and his wife (Greta Scacchi who does not appear in the final film). These are nice moments that showcase the strained relationship between the couple and reinforce the toll that his job is taking on them.Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.",5,Die For Oil,1151366400,"06 27, 2006",2006,2668,"['one', 'good', 'thing', 'come', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'presidency', 'wealth', 'politically', 'socially-minded', 'art', 'response', 'unpopular', 'regime', 'Leading', 'charge', 'Hollywood', 'least', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'positioned', 'vocal', 'liberal', 'celebrity', 'two', 'high', 'profile', 'movies', '2005', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Syriana', 'latter', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Stephen', 'Gaghan', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'Traffic', 'was', 'loosely', 'based', 'Robert', 'Baer', 'memoir', 'days', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Middle', 'East', 'See', 'No', 'Evil.Structurally', 'Syriana', 'same', 'template', 'Traffic', 'several', 'subplots', 'structured', 'non-linear', 'fashion', 'containing', 'more', 'layers', 'complexities.In', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'early', 'Clooney', 'excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'rusty', 'compass', 'character', 'life', 'actor', 'improved', 'refined', 'subsequent', 'role', 'more', 'more', 'what', 'going', 'eyes', 'falling', 'back', 'good', 'looks', 'performance', 'Syriana', 'obvious', 'Method', 'trappings', 'weight', 'gain', 'thick', 'beard', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'how', 'convey', 'Barnes', 'world-weariness.Gaghan', 'direction', 'stories', 'movie', 'Everything', ""n't"", 'spelled', 'out', 'are', 'lot', 'gray', 'areas', 'morally', 'ethically', 'ambiguous', 'characters', 'motivations', 'are', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'clear', 'times', 'hard', 'follow', 'characters', 'film', 'done', 'purpose', 'illustrate', 'just', 'how', 'hard', 'keep', 'track', 'players', 'Middle', 'East', 'oil', 'trade', 'numerous', 'alliances', 'obvious', 'secretive', 'corporations', 'governments', 'Trying', 'make', 'sense', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'frustrating', 'experience', 'Conversation', 'George', 'Clooney', 'actor', 'Syriana', 'designed', 'films', '1970s', 'examined', 'geopolitics', 'Robert', 'Baer', 'man', 'character', 'loosely', 'based', 'what', 'learned', 'talking', 'Make', 'Change', 'Make', 'Difference', ""n't"", 'really', 'making', 'featurette', 'rather', 'cast', 'talking', 'subject', 'matter', 'movie', 'Clooney', 'Damon', 'speak', 'passion', 'material', 'how', 'felt', 'here', 'was', 'project', 'actually', 'had', 'something', 'say', 'how', 'world', 'works.Also', 'included', 'are', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'feature', 'footage', 'Barnes', 'wife', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'who', 'not', 'appear', 'final', 'film', 'are', 'nice', 'moments', 'showcase', 'strained', 'relationship', 'couple', 'reinforce', 'toll', 'job', 'taking', 'them.Finally', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A

Unbeknownst to him the CIA and the mammoth oil companies are cooperating to provide the United States with cheap Middle Eastern oil---and God help those who stand in the way.  We Americans are guilty of supporting unjust regimes who offer few employment opportunities to their young men.

984714,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B000F7CMRM,Dennis Littrell,"[4, 4]","This is a stylish-looking intrigue thriller evocative of sound bites and headlines from the Middle East near the beginning of the 21st century.  Based loosely on CIA operative Robert Baer's memoir, See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Solder in the CIA's War on Terrorism (2003), the main point of the movie seems to be that our need for oil compromised our efforts to stop terrorism. Or another way to look at this is to say that the CIA and the US government in general failed to make an effective transition from Cold War intelligence operations to the so-called War on Terror.Oil companies conspiring to increase supply and profits, Arabian princes vying to become the next emir, CIA agents sleuthing in dangerous lands, board meetings and cocktail parties with wealthy and influential international players, bombs going off, fear and torture, and a very nice precision rocket launch in the desert to hit exactly the fourth car in a queue are featured.  Unfortunately it's the sort of movie that looks a lot better than it plays.Director Stephen Gaghan who wrote the script for Traffic (2000), a drug war thriller in which several story lines are meshed, uses a similar technique here with the unifying factor being oil instead of street drugs.  Despite an engaging performance from George Clooney and fine support, especially in the smaller roles (e.g., William Hurt, Christopher Plummer), the formula doesn't work as well mainly because the story goes nowhere.  Plotless movies tend to bore the audience since there is no rising action leading to a climax and resolution.  Although people die and fortunes wax and wane, the linear story fails to engage our sympathies.

Several storylines are told in this all of which are related to this merger. The first one is of a CIA operative named Bob Graham who is hired to find a Saudi Prince who intends to bring about economic reform in his country should he become the new Saudi king. The second is the story of a rising oil broker (played by Matt Damon) who suffers a family tragedy and meets with an ambitious Saudi prince. The third is of an executive who is faced with a moral dilemma over the shady nature of the oil merger taking place. And finally, the fourth story is of a disenfranchised Pakistani teenager who despite everything falls victim to the recruiting tactics of a charismatic extremist cleric.

It wasn't until about an hour into the story that things finally started to make sense. But, from that point on, I was hanging onto every word and piecing together every detail.The trick to understanding this movie before it's over is to remember the names. Once you get to the point when you know who's who, everything else unfolds from there.So, what's going on?Matt Damon is a financial advisor to Prince Nassir. Prince Nassir's family just approved a deal for the chinese to come in and set up shop as oil drillers, as the chinese offered the highest bid.However, the US wants to cut the chinese out of the picture so that the newly merged connex and the smaller oil company can do their thing in place of the chinese.So, now we're at that scene when the old guy is talking to Prince Nassir's younger brother on the yacht. What you have to infer is that the ""wish"" that Nassir's younger brother wants the ""cat's paw"" to grant is to have his older brother, Prince Nassir, assassinated. In return for the favor, the US will get the oil contract instead of the chinese.That's when the CIA have George Clooney arrange for Prince Nassir to be assassinated. However, you know that doesn't work out. You might recall the torture scene. After Clooney narrowly escapes certain death, the torturer threatens to reveal the CIA's assassination attempt to the media.Next we see Clooney threatening the old man in the cafe. A trusted co-worker had informed him that the old man is setting him up to be the fall guy for any negative backlash resulting from the exposure of the failed assassination attempt.Once Clooney is able to get his passports back, he attempts to intercept Prince Nassir on the desert freeway and warn him of the danger to his life. In the freeway scene, Nassir has re-established relations with the Chinese; and with the help of 9 out of 11 of the country's generals, he is attempting to de-throne his conniving, ambitious younger brother.So, everything else is pretty much straightforward.Syrania illustrates the following points of controversy:1. The US uses its intelligence community resources to eliminate opposition to its oil interests.2. US government watchdogs are helpless to make an impact on anti-trust violations committed by oil companies, while the intelligence community acts as an accomplice to those violations.3. The US strategically ensures that oil producing countries do not improve their infrastructure, economy..etc., so as to keep them more easily controlled.Again, those are the points of view illustrated by this movie; they are not my own.",5,pay attention to the details,1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,2690,"['would', 'say', 'plot', 'up', 'more', 'suspense', 'intriguing', 'details', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'was', ""n't"", 'hour', 'story', 'things', 'finally', 'started', 'make', 'sense', 'point', 'was', 'hanging', 'word', 'piecing', 'together', 'detail.The', 'trick', 'understanding', 'movie', 'over', 'remember', 'names', 'Once', 'get', 'point', 'when', 'know', 'who', 'who', 'everything', 'else', 'there.So', 'what', 'going', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'financial', 'advisor', 'Prince', 'Nassir', 'Prince', 'Nassir', 'family', 'just', 'approved', 'deal', 'chinese', 'come', 'set', 'up', 'shop', 'oil', 'drillers', 'chinese', 'offered', 'highest', 'bid.However', 'US', 'cut', 'chinese', 'picture', 'newly', 'merged', 'connex', 'smaller', 'oil', 'company', 'can', 'do', 'thing', 'place', 'chinese.So', 'now', ""'re"", 'scene', 'when', 'old', 'guy', 'talking', 'Prince', 'Nassir', 'younger', 'brother', 'yacht', 'What', 'have', 'infer', 'wish', 'Nassir', 'younger', 'brother', 'cat', 'paw', 'grant', 'have', 'older', 'brother', 'Prince', 'Nassir', 'assassinated', 'return', 'favor', 'US', 'will', 'get', 'oil', 'contract', 'instead', 'chinese.That', 'when', 'CIA', 'have', 'George', 'Clooney', 'arrange', 'Prince', 'Nassir', 'be', 'assassinated', 'However', 'know', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'might', 'recall', 'torture', 'scene', 'Clooney', 'narrowly', 'certain', 'death', 'torturer', 'reveal', 'CIA', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'media.Next', 'see', 'Clooney', 'threatening', 'old', 'man', 'cafe', 'trusted', 'co-worker', 'had', 'informed', 'old', 'man', 'setting', 'up', 'be', 'fall', 'guy', 'negative', 'backlash', 'resulting', 'exposure', 'failed', 'assassination', 'attempt.Once', 'Clooney', 'able', 'get', 'passports', 'back', 'intercept', 'Prince', 'Nassir', 'desert', 'freeway', 'warn', 'danger', 'life', 'freeway', 'scene', 'Nassir', 're-established', 'relations', 'Chinese', 'help', '9', '11', 'country', 'generals', 'attempting', 'de-throne', 'conniving', 'ambitious', 'younger', 'brother.So', 'everything', 'else', 'pretty', 'much', 'straightforward.Syrania', 'following', 'points', 'controversy:1', 'US', 'intelligence', 'community', 'resources', 'eliminate', 'opposition', 'oil', 'interests.2', 'US', 'government', 'watchdogs', 'are', 'helpless', 'make', 'impact', 'anti-trust', 'violations', 'committed', 'oil', 'companies', 'intelligence', 'community', 'accomplice', 'violations.3', 'US', 'strategically', 'oil', 'producing', 'countries', 'do', 'not', 'improve', 'infrastructure', 'economy..etc.', 'so', 'keep', 'more', 'easily', 'controlled.Again', 'are', 'points', 'view', 'illustrated', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'own']",N/A

The movie's social commitment is impressive, but the narrative is so fragmented and some actions so vaguely motivated that the result is unfortunately something of a muddle for much of its 126-minute running time. By traipsing the globe in brief scenes one after the other, Gaghan attempts to peel the layers off the complex and often corrupt relationships among American oil companies, intelligence agencies, the government and the ruling class of the oil-rich Persian Gulf. With its shaky hand-held camerawork and lightning-quick pacing, the movie bears a striking similarity to Stephen Soderbergh's version of ""Traffic"" (he is an executive producer here) but not in terms of its dramatic resonance.There are at least four separate stories that intertwine through the various locales, most intriguingly in a fictional Arab country where one of two sons is about to become the ruling emir. Which one is selected has direct bearing on a high-profile merger between two oil companies in Texas. There is another subplot focused on a Pakistani oil worker whose frustrations with the oil companies lead him toward drastic measures. None of these strands are very clear at the outset, nor how they are interrelated. I kept hoping there would be a more lucid portrayal of the volatile Middle East situation amid the military forces and oil companies. Instead, like what Fernando Meirelles does with ""The Constant Gardener"", which has a similar disregard for the major pharmaceutical companies in Africa, Gaghan seems to be going for a more visceral tone to drive his story, and on that level, it works.What also works is the stellar acting even if the characters are so elliptical in motivation that you need a playbook to keep up with their stories. The three leads are quite effective. As Bob Barnes, a rogue CIA operative respected for his experience but alienated by his entrepreneurial approach to his work, George Clooney appears to be evolving nicely into character roles that stretch his skills. Through soulful gazes and some brutalizing scenes of torture, he is able to convey his character's conscience with a minimum of fuss. Matt Damon is ideally cast as Bryan Woodman, a derivatives trader and global finance expert who provides guidance to the ""good"" son, a progressive Arab prince who really wants to restructure his country's economy for lasting benefit to its citizenry. Jeffrey Wright continues to impress as Bennett Holiday, an ambitious Washington lawyer ordered by his boss to not only vet the oil merger but rubber stamp it. Intriguingly, all three characters have been given more personal profiles - Barnes has a college-age son with whom he feels estranged, Woodman goes through the loss of a child, and Holiday has a resentful alcoholic father - but none of these dimensions are explored with any depth.Gaghan has certainly assembled an extensive cast, and there are solid contributions from Alexander Siddig as the reform-minded Prince Nasir Al-Subaai, Chris Cooper as one of the oil company CEOs, Christopher Plummer as Holiday's corrupt boss, Jayne Atkinson as the poker-faced CIA division chief, and Amanda Peet as Woodman's inconsolable wife.

984728,A2M6LX7CGZIED1,B000F7CMRM,"Elizabeth K. ""Elizabeth""","[6, 12]","When I saw the trailer for Syriana, I was completely delighted that a 'fiction' film exposing the oil was would be coming out to theatres, enlightening the masses on how it is indeed a fight to the death for the corrupt oil industry. When my fiance and I rented this, however, we were beyond disappointed. Let me explain:First of all, I want to point out that I LOVED the actor who portrayed the juste prince and was blown away by his stunning looks and performance. George Clooney, too, did a good job. However, Matt Damon was forgettable and so were most of the other actors, save Amanda Peet who did well when she was onscreen.The film was very, very slow, and since it was tracing quite a few stories and going over a ton of information that takes a little bit to ingest ( even for the intelligent, it takes a moment, as the dialogue is very quick), I had to force myself to get through it, in hope that some kind of resolution would occur.This film, with its multiple stories, was not as connected and alluring as Crash, and this irritated me. People all over the US know about the corruption we deal with, and the pseudo brainwashing that is done overseas to create bombers and terrorists, but still many don't understand just how serious the war for oil is. This film could have appealed to them IF it was more fast paced and connected. But as there were some scenes and stories that really had nothing to do with anything ( like Matt Damon and his family; though it was sad and shocking about his son, it was not incredibly pertinent and threw you off. Also, the  interesting and sad tale about the father and son immigrants who turned to Islam and got invovled with Cloon's weapon kind of threw you off, though it easily could have been made more relevant.)I know this review may have offended som Syriana lovers, and I understand that. The message of corruption in the CIA and oil is beyond important to portray, but I realy feel that it could have been done in a more fast paced way, and the stories could have been even more connected and powerful.",2,"Sadly, it missed what it was trying to hit...",1150588800,"06 18, 2006",2006,2060,"['When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Syriana', 'was', 'completely', 'delighted', ""'fiction"", 'film', 'exposing', 'oil', 'was', 'would', 'be', 'coming', 'theatres', 'enlightening', 'masses', 'how', 'indeed', 'fight', 'death', 'corrupt', 'oil', 'industry', 'When', 'fiance', 'rented', 'however', 'were', 'disappointed', 'Let', 'explain', 'First', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'LOVED', 'actor', 'who', 'portrayed', 'juste', 'prince', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'stunning', 'looks', 'performance', 'George', 'Clooney', 'too', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'However', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'was', 'forgettable', 'so', 'were', 'most', 'other', 'actors', 'save', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'who', 'did', 'well', 'when', 'was', 'onscreen.The', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'slow', 'was', 'tracing', 'quite', 'few', 'stories', 'going', 'ton', 'information', 'little', 'bit', 'ingest', 'even', 'intelligent', 'moment', 'dialogue', 'very', 'quick', 'had', 'force', 'get', 'hope', 'kind', 'resolution', 'would', 'occur.This', 'film', 'multiple', 'stories', 'was', 'not', 'connected', 'alluring', 'Crash', 'irritated', 'People', 'US', 'know', 'corruption', 'deal', 'pseudo', 'brainwashing', 'done', 'overseas', 'create', 'bombers', 'terrorists', 'still', 'many', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'just', 'how', 'serious', 'war', 'oil', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'appealed', 'IF', 'was', 'more', 'fast', 'paced', 'connected', 'were', 'scenes', 'stories', 'really', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'family', 'was', 'sad', 'shocking', 'son', 'was', 'not', 'incredibly', 'pertinent', 'threw', 'off', 'Also', 'interesting', 'sad', 'tale', 'father', 'son', 'immigrants', 'who', 'turned', 'Islam', 'got', 'invovled', 'Cloon', 'weapon', 'kind', 'threw', 'off', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'more', 'relevant', 'know', 'review', 'may', 'have', 'offended', 'som', 'Syriana', 'lovers', 'understand', 'message', 'corruption', 'CIA', 'oil', 'important', 'portray', 'realy', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'more', 'fast', 'paced', 'way', 'stories', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'connected', 'powerful']",N/A

If you believe that oil companies, big law firms, the U.S. government, the CIA, arab shieks, financiers are all corrupt and evil then you will love this movie for its ""realistic"" portrayal.  For the rest of us, the film comes across as a dark, cynical and ultimately one-dimensional vision of a world gone mad over oil.That said, it is mesmerizing to watch.  From the first scene, the movie grabs our attention.  George Clooney has just sold a bomb to some locals in Iran.  What will it be used for?  Is Clooney going to get killed?  Is he a good guy or bad guy?  We don't find out right away, as the film skips around from one location to another and from one subplot to another with dizzying speed, usually just long enough for us to get the idea that someone is about to get backstabbed, double-crossed, conned, tortured or killed.  The cinematography is edgy; the soundtrack is menacing.  We constantly have a sense that something evil is about to happen.  Most of the time we don't know what and we don't know why, but we are pretty sure that it has something to do with OIL.Warning: don't leave your seat in the middle to get some popcorn; you'll be hopelessly lost.  I spent half the movie trying to figure out what was going on.  What does the CIA operative in Beirut have to do with the energy analyst in Geneva have to do with the law firm in Washington have to do with the Pakistani workers in the Persian Gulf, and on it goes.  The common theme, of course, is oil.  Finally, in the last third of the movie, the various sub-plots start to come together and give eachother meaning.  But it's too little, too late.  The movie is spread so thin with multiple characters and stories, that there is little satisfying resolution to anything.""Syriana"" will be compared to ""Traffic"", and the styles are similar, but the characters and subplots in Traffic are more fully developed, and enough of the characters are sympathetic, with the result that the viewer is more engrossed in how it all turns out.

Unfortunately, ""Syriana"" lacks the fundamental assets that made ""The Constant Gardener"" work as a movie even if one did not agree with its political agenda: the guidance of an experienced world-class director, Fernando Mireilles; a memorable musical score by a world-class composer, Alberto Iglesias; and, most importantly, a screenplay based upon the novel of a world-class novelist, John Le Carre, a past-master at balancing the intricacies of plot in such a way that the reader or viewer can still perceive the thread of the narrative.The fast-paced cutting between sequences  seems intended to provide ""Syriana"" with an edgy feel.

For example, a subtitle will read ""Geneva,"" and then, suddenly, without any notice, the viewer has been transported to an office complex in Langley, Virginia, or Washington, D.C.; the playing fields of an anonymous oil-rich country; the docks of Beirut,  or some place in Mallorca (etc., etc.). By the time I was able to figure out where in the world was Waldo--or Matt Damon, I discovered that I had missed some important point of the plot. Because of the tetchy editing, any new take on the message that the writers, directors, and producers were trying to deliver on the subject of Big Oil was garbled.Only the musical score, which contributed a subtle crescendo of suspense, kept me following the tangles of the extremely complicated plot, hoping that my persistence would pay off in a great revelation that was, alas, never to be realized.Unfortunately, it takes more than a good musical score to prop up a movie, especially a movie with a message.",3,Garbled in Translation,1157328000,"09 4, 2006",2006,2075,"['Syriana', 'attempts', 'do', 'oil', 'industry', 'what', 'Constant', 'Gardner', 'did', 'pharmaceutical', 'industry', 'expose', 'corruption', 'system', 'collusion', 'Big', 'Business', 'Government', 'Syriana', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'therefore', 'timely', 'controversial', 'actors', 'are', 'more', 'competent', 'cinematography', 'more', 'accomplished', 'musical', 'score', 'sufficiently', 'riveting', 'Unfortunately', 'Syriana', 'fundamental', 'assets', 'made', 'Constant', 'Gardener', 'work', 'movie', 'even', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'agree', 'political', 'agenda', 'guidance', 'experienced', 'world-class', 'director', 'Fernando', 'Mireilles', 'memorable', 'musical', 'score', 'world-class', 'composer', 'Alberto', 'Iglesias', 'most', 'importantly', 'screenplay', 'based', 'novel', 'world-class', 'novelist', 'John', 'Le', 'Carre', 'past-master', 'balancing', 'intricacies', 'plot', 'such', 'way', 'reader', 'viewer', 'can', 'still', 'perceive', 'thread', 'narrative.The', 'fast-paced', 'cutting', 'sequences', 'intended', 'provide', 'Syriana', 'edgy', 'feel', 'However', 'others', 'have', 'commented', 'length', 'technique', 'only', 'confuse', 'example', 'subtitle', 'will', 'read', 'Geneva', 'then', 'suddenly', 'notice', 'viewer', 'been', 'transported', 'office', 'complex', 'Langley', 'Virginia', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'playing', 'fields', 'anonymous', 'oil-rich', 'country', 'docks', 'Beirut', 'place', 'Mallorca', 'etc.', 'etc.', 'time', 'was', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'world', 'was', 'Waldo', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'discovered', 'had', 'missed', 'important', 'point', 'plot', 'tetchy', 'editing', 'new', 'take', 'message', 'writers', 'directors', 'producers', 'were', 'trying', 'deliver', 'subject', 'Big', 'Oil', 'was', 'garbled.Only', 'musical', 'score', 'contributed', 'subtle', 'crescendo', 'suspense', 'kept', 'following', 'tangles', 'extremely', 'complicated', 'plot', 'hoping', 'persistence', 'would', 'pay', 'off', 'great', 'revelation', 'was', 'alas', 'never', 'be', 'realized.Unfortunately', 'more', 'good', 'musical', 'score', 'prop', 'up', 'movie', 'especially', 'movie', 'message']",N/A

Using the CIA as their tool, they set out to murder everyone who gets in their way. Two young Middle Easterners rise up against this megalithic monstrosity.  One is the wealthy son of an Emir and the other is the poverty stricken son of an oil worker.  As the labyrinthine plot winds to a pyrotechnic ending, the wealthy prince seeks to overthrow his father's government and set up a government based on principles of liberty, equality, and democracy and thereby save the world.  Of course, the Great Satan must do everything possible to prevent the spread of ideals so foreign to its nature.  Meanwhile the poverty stricken youth studies at the feet of a guru who teaches the complementary doctrines of love, peace, and tranquility on the one hand and blowing up yourself and innocent people in the name of God on the other.Will the movie end in multiple explosions as the poverty stricken youth lovingly, peacefully, and tranquilly blows himself and countless innocent people to kingdom come?  Will the rich prince be taken out by the Great Satan as he is on the verge of saving the world?  Will the bad guys live happily ever after as the world continues its downward spiral to abject poverty and misery?  Or will George Clooney and Matt Damon be able to foil the bad guys, establish Western values in the Middle East despite the best efforts of the CIA, and thereby change the course of history?  It will take you approximately two hours to find out.Bela Lugosi's last movie, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" is supposed to be the worst movie ever made.  ""Syriana"" may just edge ""Plan 9"" out for that honor.A FOOTNOTE ON PREMISES:  This movie bottoms its plot on two premises:  Premise one teaches that the United States government is the enemy of true free-market capitalism and democracy in the Middle East.  Premise two teaches that a heroic United States citizen (Matt Damon) can save the Middle East by guiding it into the development of free-market capitalism and democracy.

Not because it was that good, although it is, but because I will admittedly include myself among the others who labored to keep the ends tied together on this movie. It's easy to forgive my slow comprehension since I believe the confusion of this movie was intentional, so that neither the audience OR the movies characters have a clear view of the bigger picture. Everyone is lost in the same fog. I'm further clouded with how a movie of this caliber ever made the big screen!It's not easy to give a synopsis of this movie, and I'm not sure I would trust any review that tries to make it seem as if they have this movie -- or the issues it covers -- all figured out. Instead, I think the movie is speculating about the many anonymous faces and the lives that go with them that constitute the loose political debates we often indulge. From a proverbial 10,000 foot view it's easy to polarize all the players -- this one being good, this one being evil. Sure, there are sub-characters in this movie that wouldn't take much effort to hate, but none of the foreground characters come off as malicious -- and yet, they all make moral compromises that are easily debateble. Matt Damon's character in particular represents a broader version of so many people I've certainly met in my travels whose ambitions seem to cloud the values that we know are at the very heart of them -- or, at least, that's what we hope.Hollywood movies usually offer a very simple prescription that makes the ingestion of two hours painless and effortless. Entertainment comes first. And if there's a message to be said, it is usually stripped down to the point of passive platitudes.Syriana is the exact opposite. It's the cinematic equivalent of active reading. You really do have to pay attention and it does require the brain to work.

He knows how to take a controversial topic, spread it over a period of time and from vantages that involve everyone who would ever view his information, and pace a film in such away that his viewers must stay glued to the screen and soundtrack so that not a moment of the powerful bits of intrigue he is relating fall out of place.  It worked for TRAFFIC: it is stunningly effective in SYRIANA.Syriana is not just a story.  Syriana is a conglomerate of stories that have as a common thread the impact the oil industry has on the globe and on every inhabitant.  Involving the CIA, FBI, oil companies, Arab nations, common workers in the oil fields, children, princes, parents, spies, China, terrorists, self-martyrdom - the playing field that Gaghan gives to us piece by painfully confluent piece faults global economy, US and Middle East greed, and the pitiful reality of the global dependence on oil that threatens to destroy individuals and countries, if not the planet.Gaghan's method of filmmaking can be tough to follow, so seemingly dissociated are the elements of the story as it unfolds in different parts of the world, with different sets of characters somewhat tangential to reality at times and thus jolting to the linear mind.  To write a synopsis of the plot is counterproductive to experiencing the film.  Suffice it to say that every member of the huge cast is right on target: George Clooney, Matt Damon, Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Peet, Chris Cooper, Amr Waked, Christopher Plummer, Kayvan Novak, Alexander Siddig, Tim Blake Nelson, and Mark Strong are only a few of the extraordinarily well cast group of characters. And in all fairness the contributions of Alexandre Desplat who gives his usual high degree of excellence to the musical scoring, the cinematography by Robert Elswit and the film editing by Tim Squyres are an integral part of the impact of this powerful and very important film.

Then again, Hollywood could use more films that force viewers to stay focused and think about things.  This is an excellent, thought-provoking film that should not be missed.First, the acting is great. George Clooney looks like hell, which is appropriate for this, and his role and subsequent treatment by the CIA are both quite believeable.  Matt Damon puts in a terrific performance, although his marriage to Amanda Peet never feels quite real.  His storyline could easily support a sequel, although it would be a very different story.  Chris Cooper is wonderfully creepy as a homegrown oil company CEO.  And Jeffrey Wright is so good that all the way through the film -- right to the end -- you won't be sure if he's a good guy, a sleazy opportunist, a survivor in Washington's geo-political gameplaying, or a little of all three.Several other big stars show up throughout this, but I think one of the best -- and most underrated -- performances came from Alexander Siddig, as an Arab prince trying to make a difference in the face of international subterfuge and betrayal.  Add in heartbreakingly realistic portayals of neophyte ""terrorists"" by newcomers Ahmed Ayoub and Mohammed Asad Khan, along with numerous other fine character actors, and you've got an incredibly enjoyable, if sometimes disturbing (on many levels), movie.Of course, there's also been a lot of trash talking about political angles supposedly criticized, espoused, or otherwise depicted within this film.  Here's the thing, though - it's just a movie.  This is fictional political intrigue not that far afield, especially in how it casts the American government, from films like ""The Bourne Identity,"" ""Enemy of the State,"" or even ""The Man Who Knew Too Much.""

Don't trust the critics.First off, this movie has a strong cast. Matt Damon, Amanda Peet, George Clooney, William Hurt and Chris Cooper are all in it. But none of them give great performances. I have to say that Clonney gives the best of the pack. The rest of them are emotionless and ultimately dissapointing. William Hurt, one of the finest American actors is in the movie for 2 minutes. And this left me thinking: what the hell is going on? Why is he even in it? This is ridiculous!The movie's plot centers around oil but there are so many sub plots that your head will spin. Now, the movie isn't hard to follow, I understood what was going on but there was no need for all of these sub plots. The movie couldn't pick a topic..no it had to pick 50 and jam them into one movie. That is ridiculous. All of the characters are underdeveloped. ALL OF THEM.Matt Damon and Amanda Peet. WOW. What the heck was the point of one of their sons dying? It's just thrown in there, so very randomly. Why? To add more drama? That made the movie out as a soap opra!Jeffrey Wright is very dissapointing. No emotion at all. Absolutely none. And what is up with his father? Why is his character's father in the movie? Their relationship also isn't shown. When the father flips him off, why?George Clooney is married with a kid. What is happening with their relationships? Why is the kid so mad at him?His character is lame. Why does he take getting his nails pulled off? Or should I say RIPPED off? He acts like he doesn't care about it.And for me, a simple movie buff, this overcomplicated plot with too many characters and too many locations wasn't my cup of tea. Sure if you're some historian, it may be more interesting.George Clooney is on the screen for 5 minutes in Iran, then BAM, we're in Texas with Chris Cooper, them BAM in Washington D.C. with Jeffrey Wright then BAM back in Iran. That is how the movie follows and quite frankly, that gives me a headache. And the shift between subtitles and none, WOW. TALK ABOUT GETTING A HEADACHE.But if you want to get a headache, check this out. The movie had interesting points but couldn't pick one and in the end was a soap opra and we were supposed to feel bad for Clooney and Damon. Well, I didn't.

984752,A7PZZXJJZM4N2,B000F7CMRM,Isaac,"[7, 11]","Buried beneath the hectic 126 minutes of Stephen Gaghan's ambitious ""Syriana"" lies an impenetrable conflict: the world is apparently running out of oil, and there are people out there who want to get their hands on what's left. The question of who they are writes the kind of fate the world will have, and what their motives are will consummate that fate. ""Ninety percent of what's left is in the Middle East,"" says Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon), an energy analyst who works for a newly merged oil company. What he says may or may not be true, but the real problem is the geographical location: the Middle East, that land which has, for centuries, been the hosting place of bitter wars and gratuitous conflicts.Writer and director Stephen Gaghan has crafted a humdinger of a movie, which questions the very nature of America's international policy concerning oil. This is the cold and multilateral story of the aftermath of the merging of two major oil companies, Connex and Killen, and their perfunctory standings on oil consumption, which manages to connect with China. Observing the film from a distance, one would conclude that it is modern film noir, crediting it's influence from the Cold War paranoia films of the 1970s.As far as espionage thrillers go, ""Syriana"" manages to stand in a category of its own. Or maybe I am putting the film on a pedestal because films like this intrigue me. Still, there are many material areas that appear to be unconventional. ""Syriana"" does not drift into the traditional moral gunplay of good and evil, right and wrong, Left and Right, dictatorships and democracy. We can count on Tom Clancy for those kinds of thrillers. Gaghan's film argues, from a neutral standpoint, that there are good guys and bad guys on both sides, and a deeper level of penetration is that the ""both sides"" can be on totally separate planes.Describing the plot of the film would drive me to tears, because the film is so detailed and complex that giving a full synopsis would give everything away. What Gaghan gives us is a gallery of colorful and well-written characters, and the most important ones are played by famous actors who serve as breadcrumbs through the forest. There is Robert Barnes (George Clooney), a CIA agent who gets caught up in a messy predicament, Bryan Woodman, mentioned above, an analyst who is overseeing the finances of an oil company in Geneva, Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer), a lawyer who is overseeing the political and legal implications of the Connex-Killen merger, and Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright), Whiting's employee who is assigned to handle allegations with the Chinese.By now you are probably tearing your hair out, calling me bad names, and wondering what the hell I'm talking about, but you are approaching the wrong movie if you desire to witness a linear transgression from conflict to solution. ""Syriana"" is submersed in conflict, with a solution that may never come to pass. What the characters experience in the movie is what tugs the film along, since things come to a near hault at several points and the screenplay becomes overwhelmed with character juggling. There were moments where I had no clue what was going on, but I was constantly drawn in by the characters themselves, their actions, their ambiguous motivations, and, more often than not, the dialogue. These people are obviously students of Shakespeare, because what they say sometimes makes no sense, but you know the undercurrents of the story and so you go with flow.Most of this geopolitical mosaic is essentially people huddled together in conference rooms, offices, and restauarants discussing what they should do about the situation at hand. The situation seems unsolvable: we are running out of oil. These people seem powerless in their approach to a solution. But what we realize is that the film is all the more extraordinary because of that. What appears to be an arrogant liberal video game in the previews turns out to be a critique on global relations from outer space.Stephen Gaghan is, unsurprisingly, the parent of ""Traffic,"" a powerful film that dissected the human nature buried beneath drug trafficking. You can definitely see the same quality here. Although it falls marginally short of total greatness, this is probably one of the most fascinating movies I have hever seen. Whenever a story crackles with suspense and drifts from locale to locale with purpose and ambition, you know that taking your eyes off the screen is next to impossible. Even if you are unable to follow it, which is the film's purpose within and of itself, you are still captivated by its shocking reality, and your skin begins to crawl because, like in ""The Constant Gardener,"" the horrors that are occurring onscreen are entirely possible. ""Syriana"" is a must see. - IsaacRated R; 126 minutes; Directed by Stephen Gaghan",5,Syriana,1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,4847,"['Buried', 'hectic', '126', 'minutes', 'Stephen', 'Gaghan', 'ambitious', 'Syriana', 'impenetrable', 'conflict', 'world', 'apparently', 'running', 'out', 'oil', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'hands', 'what', 'left', 'question', 'who', 'are', 'kind', 'fate', 'world', 'will', 'have', 'what', 'motives', 'are', 'will', 'consummate', 'fate', 'Ninety', 'percent', 'what', 'left', 'Middle', 'East', 'Bryan', 'Woodman', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'energy', 'analyst', 'who', 'newly', 'merged', 'oil', 'company', 'What', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'real', 'problem', 'geographical', 'location', 'Middle', 'East', 'land', 'centuries', 'been', 'hosting', 'place', 'bitter', 'wars', 'gratuitous', 'conflicts.Writer', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Gaghan', 'crafted', 'humdinger', 'movie', 'questions', 'very', 'nature', 'America', 'international', 'policy', 'concerning', 'oil', 'cold', 'multilateral', 'story', 'aftermath', 'merging', 'two', 'major', 'oil', 'companies', 'Connex', 'Killen', 'perfunctory', 'standings', 'oil', 'consumption', 'connect', 'China', 'Observing', 'film', 'distance', 'one', 'would', 'conclude', 'modern', 'film', 'noir', 'crediting', 'influence', 'Cold', 'War', 'paranoia', 'films', '1970s.As', 'far', 'espionage', 'thrillers', 'go', 'Syriana', 'stand', 'category', 'own', 'maybe', 'am', 'putting', 'film', 'pedestal', 'films', 'intrigue', 'Still', 'are', 'many', 'material', 'areas', 'appear', 'be', 'unconventional', 'Syriana', 'not', 'drift', 'traditional', 'moral', 'gunplay', 'good', 'evil', 'right', 'wrong', 'Left', 'Right', 'dictatorships', 'democracy', 'can', 'count', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'kinds', 'thrillers', 'Gaghan', 'film', 'argues', 'neutral', 'standpoint', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'sides', 'deeper', 'level', 'penetration', 'sides', 'can', 'be', 'totally', 'separate', 'planes.Describing', 'plot', 'film', 'would', 'drive', 'tears', 'film', 'so', 'detailed', 'complex', 'giving', 'full', 'synopsis', 'would', 'give', 'everything', 'away', 'What', 'Gaghan', 'gallery', 'colorful', 'well-written', 'characters', 'most', 'important', 'ones', 'are', 'played', 'famous', 'actors', 'who', 'serve', 'breadcrumbs', 'forest', 'Robert', 'Barnes', 'George', 'Clooney', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'caught', 'up', 'messy', 'predicament', 'Bryan', 'Woodman', 'mentioned', 'analyst', 'who', 'overseeing', 'finances', 'oil', 'company', 'Geneva', 'Dean', 'Whiting', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'lawyer', 'who', 'overseeing', 'political', 'legal', 'implications', 'Connex-Killen', 'merger', 'Bennett', 'Holiday', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'Whiting', 'employee', 'who', 'assigned', 'handle', 'allegations', 'Chinese.By', 'now', 'are', 'probably', 'tearing', 'hair', 'calling', 'bad', 'names', 'wondering', 'what', 'hell', ""'m"", 'talking', 'are', 'approaching', 'wrong', 'movie', 'desire', 'witness', 'linear', 'transgression', 'conflict', 'solution', 'Syriana', 'submersed', 'conflict', 'solution', 'may', 'never', 'come', 'pass', 'What', 'characters', 'experience', 'movie', 'what', 'film', 'things', 'come', 'near', 'hault', 'several', 'points', 'screenplay', 'overwhelmed', 'character', 'juggling', 'were', 'moments', 'where', 'had', 'clue', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'constantly', 'drawn', 'characters', 'actions', 'ambiguous', 'motivations', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'dialogue', 'people', 'are', 'obviously', 'students', 'Shakespeare', 'what', 'say', 'sometimes', 'sense', 'know', 'undercurrents', 'story', 'so', 'go', 'flow.Most', 'geopolitical', 'mosaic', 'essentially', 'people', 'huddled', 'together', 'conference', 'rooms', 'offices', 'restauarants', 'discussing', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'situation', 'hand', 'situation', 'unsolvable', 'are', 'running', 'oil', 'people', 'seem', 'powerless', 'approach', 'solution', 'what', 'realize', 'film', 'more', 'extraordinary', 'What', 'be', 'arrogant', 'liberal', 'video', 'game', 'previews', 'out', 'be', 'critique', 'global', 'relations', 'outer', 'space.Stephen', 'Gaghan', 'unsurprisingly', 'parent', 'Traffic', 'powerful', 'film', 'dissected', 'human', 'nature', 'buried', 'drug', 'trafficking', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'same', 'quality', 'here', 'marginally', 'short', 'total', 'greatness', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'movies', 'have', 'hever', 'seen', 'Whenever', 'story', 'crackles', 'suspense', 'drifts', 'locale', 'locale', 'purpose', 'ambition', 'know', 'taking', 'eyes', 'screen', 'next', 'impossible', 'Even', 'are', 'unable', 'follow', 'film', 'purpose', 'are', 'still', 'captivated', 'shocking', 'reality', 'skin', 'crawl', 'because', 'Constant', 'Gardener', 'horrors', 'are', 'occurring', 'onscreen', 'are', 'entirely', 'possible', 'Syriana', 'must', 'see', 'IsaacRated', 'R', '126', 'minutes', 'Directed', 'Stephen', 'Gaghan']",N/A

Of course, that concept is not really all that new. Oil seems to always be the true motivation behind our meddling, which has left us hated, in the Middle East. As a result of that hate, 9/11 and the domino effect it started have already taken a huge toll on our economy and standing in the world.Syriana exposes the questionable relations between the CIA, Oil companies, foreign leaders, or rather dictators, and terrorist.

First, the USA are only interested in oil and natural gas in the Middle East and Central Asia, and they have to face Chinese competition, so all means are good to get rid of that menace. Second, the USA will use all their power, military included, to set up governments in the Middle East countries with leaders who will favour them, even if they are absolutely unable to govern and manage their countries. Third, all leaders or would-be leaders who want to invest the oil revenue in building a sustainable economy and a sustainable political democracy in their countries are enemies who have to be eliminated by all means. Finally this creates some resentment among the Moslems, some frustration to be poor when there is so much money going around, and some desire to re-establis God's law in their countries and in the world by pushing away these American and Western invaders, hence the readiness for these to sacrifice their life in a flash of lightning in order to destroy this machine that is crushing the Moslem world into a pitiful state, into slavery and sinful perversion. In the end the only winners, short-term winners mind you, are the oil companies and the oil industry tycoons. But how long will this fable and fantasy go on and last ?

984755,A2LPCZ7UBT4Y6N,B000F7CMRM,"Jameson L. Thottam ""mortgage maven""","[5, 8]","Jameson Thottam with some thoughts on SyrianaOil, is perhaps the most precious natural resource on the planet and also one of the most controversial. It powers industry and the economies of many nations, yet the regions that contain the largest amounts are often the most unstable, and this instability often results from the influences of the very nations that purchase the oil.It is a tenuous situation where buyer and seller are wary of one another and at times regard the other as a necessary evil. The money paid for the oil has made suppliers and handlers rich and powerful, but many on the outside of this privileged circle believe that greed has caused both sides to lose focus on what is most important for the people of their nations.Back to the Film (Jameson Thottam)In the film Syriana viewers follow the paths of different people from various walks of life who for the most part do not know one another, yet are all linked by the same cause, oil.The Characters (Jameson Thottam)There is the C.I.A. agent Bob Barnes (George Clooney), who spends time in locales such as Iran and Beirut eliminating threats to national security.A lawyer, (Jeffrey Wright), who is caught in the middle as he attempts to find, and if need be eliminate damaging material that can prevent a pending merger between two oil companies.There is the grieving energy analyst Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon), who deals with his loss by siding up with a powerful Prince, (Alexander Siddig), even at the alienation of his family.There is also a displaced Pakistani worker who after losing his job when a Chinese company acquires the refinery where he worked, falls in with a group of radicals with a militant agenda.The above is just a small sampling of the characters as there are numerous business, political, and Middle Eastern citizens who all play very prominent parts in the story.The Key Focus ( Jameson Thottam )The main focus of the film is not only to illustrate the connectivity between the characters but to show how politics and big business influence policy in oil rich nations and how through secret deals, political intrigue, and treachery policy in and towards the same oil producing nations are set into place and maintained.While this is not much of a shock to people who follow the news, it is the way that director Stephen Gaghan uses ordinary and in some ways unremarkable people to tell the story and how it affects those who deal with oil.The Complexities ( Jameson Thottam )Even those who are supposed the big players are often simply being played by forces outside their control in a world where reality and perceptions are often miles apart. The complex nature of the story is actually a model of simplicity as cause and effect, as well as the ability of big business to influence lawmakers is what drives the film.The cast is strong especially Clooney and Siddig who make their characters sympathetic while at the same time captivating. The contrast of the men who are a Prince and an agent, yet whose destinies often cause them to walk along the same paths is amazing.Closing (Jameson Thottam)Syriana is an amazing film that is so complex in its simplicity. The basic message is very clear, yet the layers that must be uncovered like a tangled web of lies in telling the story is a far reaching journey that will shock and anger most viewers.Some may find fault with a so called liberal agenda to the film, but politics aside, ""Syriana"" is a very captivating and entertaining film that makes you think.Review EndJameson Thottam",4,Jameson Thottam with some thoughts on Syriana,1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,3531,"['Jameson', 'Thottam', 'thoughts', 'SyrianaOil', 'perhaps', 'most', 'precious', 'natural', 'resource', 'planet', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'industry', 'economies', 'many', 'nations', 'yet', 'regions', 'contain', 'largest', 'amounts', 'are', 'often', 'most', 'unstable', 'instability', 'often', 'results', 'influences', 'very', 'nations', 'purchase', 'oil.It', 'tenuous', 'situation', 'where', 'buyer', 'seller', 'are', 'wary', 'one', 'times', 'regard', 'other', 'necessary', 'evil', 'money', 'paid', 'oil', 'made', 'suppliers', 'handlers', 'rich', 'powerful', 'many', 'outside', 'privileged', 'circle', 'believe', 'greed', 'caused', 'sides', 'lose', 'focus', 'what', 'most', 'important', 'people', 'nations.Back', 'Film', 'Jameson', 'Thottam', 'film', 'Syriana', 'viewers', 'follow', 'paths', 'different', 'people', 'various', 'walks', 'life', 'who', 'most', 'part', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'one', 'are', 'linked', 'same', 'cause', 'oil.The', 'Characters', 'Jameson', 'Thottam', 'C.I.A', 'agent', 'Bob', 'Barnes', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'time', 'locales', 'such', 'Iran', 'Beirut', 'eliminating', 'threats', 'national', 'security.A', 'lawyer', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'who', 'caught', 'middle', 'find', 'need', 'be', 'eliminate', 'damaging', 'material', 'can', 'prevent', 'pending', 'merger', 'two', 'oil', 'companies.There', 'grieving', 'energy', 'analyst', 'Bryan', 'Woodman', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'who', 'loss', 'siding', 'up', 'powerful', 'Prince', 'Alexander', 'Siddig', 'even', 'alienation', 'family.There', 'also', 'displaced', 'Pakistani', 'worker', 'who', 'losing', 'job', 'when', 'Chinese', 'company', 'refinery', 'where', 'worked', 'group', 'radicals', 'militant', 'agenda.The', 'above', 'just', 'small', 'sampling', 'characters', 'are', 'numerous', 'business', 'political', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'citizens', 'who', 'play', 'very', 'prominent', 'parts', 'story.The', 'Key', 'Focus', 'Jameson', 'Thottam', 'main', 'focus', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'illustrate', 'connectivity', 'characters', 'show', 'how', 'politics', 'big', 'business', 'influence', 'policy', 'oil', 'rich', 'nations', 'how', 'secret', 'deals', 'political', 'intrigue', 'treachery', 'policy', 'same', 'oil', 'producing', 'nations', 'are', 'set', 'place', 'maintained.While', 'not', 'much', 'shock', 'people', 'who', 'follow', 'news', 'way', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Gaghan', 'ordinary', 'ways', 'unremarkable', 'people', 'tell', 'story', 'how', 'who', 'deal', 'oil.The', 'Complexities', 'Jameson', 'Thottam', 'Even', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'big', 'players', 'are', 'often', 'simply', 'being', 'played', 'forces', 'control', 'world', 'where', 'reality', 'perceptions', 'are', 'often', 'miles', 'apart', 'complex', 'nature', 'story', 'actually', 'model', 'simplicity', 'cause', 'effect', 'as', 'well', 'ability', 'big', 'business', 'influence', 'lawmakers', 'film.The', 'cast', 'strong', 'especially', 'Clooney', 'Siddig', 'who', 'make', 'characters', 'sympathetic', 'same', 'time', 'captivating', 'contrast', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'Prince', 'agent', 'yet', 'destinies', 'often', 'cause', 'walk', 'same', 'paths', 'amazing.Closing', 'Jameson', 'Thottam', 'Syriana', 'amazing', 'film', 'so', 'complex', 'simplicity', 'basic', 'message', 'very', 'clear', 'yet', 'layers', 'must', 'be', 'uncovered', 'tangled', 'web', 'lies', 'telling', 'story', 'far', 'reaching', 'journey', 'will', 'shock', 'anger', 'most', 'viewers.Some', 'may', 'find', 'fault', 'so', 'called', 'liberal', 'agenda', 'film', 'politics', 'aside', 'Syriana', 'very', 'captivating', 'entertaining', 'film', 'think.Review', 'EndJameson', 'Thottam']",N/A

""A New Yorker""","[6, 10]","""Munich"" was much more successful as a piece of entertainment, with an exciting thriller plot and more fully developed characters. The people in ""Syriana"" are just pawns in a diplomatic game, and maybe that's the point, but it doesn't make them interesting to watch. Moreover, when the filmmakers attempt to add human interest (e.g. a family tragedy befalls Matt Damon's character), it doesn't work. The ending sequence is nicely suspenseful, and ties some of the disparate plot lines together, but the movie takes much too long to get there.The worst (that is, the most boring) of the four story lines is the one where Jeffrey Wright plays a lawyer investigating possible corruption in an American oil company merger. It's very difficult to make this kind of material cinematic, and writer/director Gaghan doesn't succeed. Many of the characters involved in this plot make speeches that are meant to be thought- provoking, but they come out of nowhere and are just as quickly forgotten. Better is the story about the young man training to be a terrorist: it's easy to follow, and shows us something not usually depicted in movies. Still, sandwiched between the other plot lines, it feels like a shallow exploration of how terrorists are made.George Clooney, with his beard and weight gain, is certainly unrecognizable in his role as CIA employee Bob Barnes, and his acting is competent. But if he hadn't been involved in ""Goodnight and Good Luck"" this same year, I doubt he would have won the Oscar for this performance. Even here, he is outshone by Alexander Siddig, who plays Nasir, a reformist Arab prince. In a movie that tries to show the complexities and gray areas of Middle Eastern oil politics, Nasir is perhaps the most complex of all: spoiled and ambitious, but with noble ideals.Also, for a movie that wants to be an intelligent exploration of the oil industry, why is the Iraq war mentioned only once, in a throwaway line?",3,Syrina  provided a Good cast but  Poor Execution,1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,1936,"['Munich', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'exciting', 'thriller', 'plot', 'more', 'fully', 'developed', 'characters', 'people', 'Syriana', 'are', 'just', 'pawns', 'diplomatic', 'game', 'maybe', 'point', ""n't"", 'make', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Moreover', 'when', 'filmmakers', 'attempt', 'add', 'human', 'interest', 'e.g', 'family', 'tragedy', 'befalls', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'character', ""n't"", 'work', 'ending', 'sequence', 'nicely', 'suspenseful', 'disparate', 'plot', 'lines', 'together', 'movie', 'much', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'there.The', 'worst', 'most', 'boring', 'four', 'story', 'lines', 'one', 'where', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'lawyer', 'investigating', 'possible', 'corruption', 'American', 'oil', 'company', 'merger', 'very', 'difficult', 'make', 'kind', 'material', 'cinematic', 'writer/director', 'Gaghan', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'Many', 'characters', 'involved', 'plot', 'make', 'speeches', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'thought-', 'provoking', 'come', 'nowhere', 'are', 'just', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'Better', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'training', 'be', 'terrorist', 'easy', 'follow', 'something', 'not', 'usually', 'depicted', 'movies', 'Still', 'sandwiched', 'other', 'plot', 'lines', 'shallow', 'exploration', 'how', 'terrorists', 'are', 'made.George', 'Clooney', 'beard', 'weight', 'gain', 'certainly', 'unrecognizable', 'role', 'CIA', 'employee', 'Bob', 'Barnes', 'acting', 'competent', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'involved', 'Goodnight', 'Good', 'Luck', 'same', 'year', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'Even', 'here', 'outshone', 'Alexander', 'Siddig', 'who', 'Nasir', 'reformist', 'Arab', 'prince', 'movie', 'show', 'complexities', 'gray', 'areas', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'oil', 'politics', 'Nasir', 'perhaps', 'most', 'complex', 'spoiled', 'ambitious', 'noble', 'ideals.Also', 'movie', 'be', 'intelligent', 'exploration', 'oil', 'industry', 'why', 'Iraq', 'war', 'mentioned', 'only', 'once', 'throwaway', 'line']",N/A

It's not to set the stage for a sequel. There is sufficient finality to end the story but maintaining credibility demands it be presented as a time slice on the continuum of fossil fuel energy resources, enormous corporations, and powerful governments.

It's supposed to be a message movie about how corruption is behind everything bad that happens in the Middle East.  It stunk.  It managed to be intensely preachy and extremely slow moving at the same time.  In place of subtlety it progressed along an intentionally confusing non-linear storyline; to the extent it has a story.  So it was supposed to be confusing in order to blur its black-and-white message.  I actually didn't find it remotely confusing - I pretty much could see where everything was headed by about 45 minutes into the film.  I guess it did have a storyline, but as it meandered around it didn't feel that way.  That's my biggest problem with it.  As with Traffic, I didn't object so much to the unmistakable message of the movie, just in its telling and in its lack of nuance.  I also found the faux nuance insulting.Munich, which hasn't been getting as good reviews, was much better.  I guess some people are finding the mixed message about the cycle of violence objectionable.  Unlike Syriana, exactly what that mixed message is is not exactly clear.

984767,AZXGPM8EKSHE9,B000F7CMRM,John,"[5, 14]","I won't rehash the points already made here. I just want to make the following points:- Wahhabist fundamentalism (the ideology followed by Al Quida) was created around 1750, long, long before there were any U.S. oil companies.- The Muslim Brotherhood was created in the 1920s and also pre-dates oil exploitation in Saudi Arabia. The core of the Muslim Brotherhood's ideology is cultural, and anti-western, not economic. The founder of the brotherhood rejected almost all western norms. It was not about oil or economics.- The 9/11 hijackers and most Islamic terrorists were not inpoverished young men, but rather, rich, well-off students who had every advantage and then some in life. The movie depicts them as exploited, which is very, very far from the truth.- The real reason why the Arab economies are so backward (the Finnish company Nokia creates more wealth every year than the ENTIRE Arab world, if you exclude oil production !) is not because the U.S. oil companies want it that way, but rather, because the Arab followed the SOVIET model for so many years. By the way, that is the same reason why India remained so economically backward until about 1990 too, and you can't blame oil on that.

He says that his father would love to more for his down trodden masses but the American president rings him up and says there is unemployment in Washington state.  So the Emir buys a set of luxurious planes that his country does not need. Sounds plausible, but...

Albeit much deeper and complicated, I'll leave the story at that to avoid a lengthy review. Syriana is a demanding and complicated yet entertaining and captivating film.The story follows four characters that are affected by oil industry politics. They are not directly connected and they never interact with each other, but they do relate. The story can be a bit overwhelming and confusing, which is why the film is demanding and complicated. You have to give this film your full attention to completely understand it, you should even go in with some background information. In fact, a second viewing may be necessary. However, the film still manages to be entertaining and captivating. Knowing the film had a complicated storyline, I actually didn't want to take my eyes of the screen and wanted to memorize the names, the locations, the actions, and the motives. The performances from the cast were also great; George Clooney being as charismatic as usual. The dialogue and conversations were immersive and authentic. The final 15 minutes or so were also deeply compelling. The music was great, as well.Overall, Syriana has an overwhelming story- a complicated yet compelling story; a story worth watching more than once, and one that can spark interest in the complicated subject. The film is technically great, from the superb performances to the great music.

It sits in the similar style of The Constant Gardener, which was released earlier this year. The film is filled to the brim with detail and every line of dialogue is meaningful to the plot in some way. Unfortunetly there can be times where so much is going on that it can be hard to follow. The film demands the attention of the audience, but if you have ADD that can be hard in this movie. This movie boasts an ensamble cast, which means that no one actor really stands out at the main character. You can argue that George Clooney is the main character, but then again Alexander Siddig gives a scene stealing performance as the Prince Nasir Al-Subaai. Each character has their own story in this intertwining plot of corruption, blackmail, and back stabbing. The plot centers around two major oil companies forming a merger, what it takes to make a profit and how power is abused to get it. The film has two very thrilling scenes. One is a torture scene that will actually make you cringe, and the beauty of it is that it makes you cringe through the magic of editing. You never actually see anything graphic, but it will make you cringe nontheless due to the fantastic acting. The next scene is actually the climax of the film, and it has a great build up, if you're watching intently it should make you jump out of your seat. Now for the political side. The film is from the new production company, Participant Productions. The company has a goal of producing films that are important reflections of world events, while still making an entertaining film. North Country and Good Night & Good Luck were both released this year under participant. This film tackles the current oil crisis that is going on the in middle east. The film throws around lots of point of views. We see the situation from the government's side, the Arabian's side, and the major oil company's side. Unfortunetly, the film leaves too much for the audience to follow, it ends up being a chore to watch. A good film, not a masterpiece, but a decent sophmore directorial attempt for Stephen Gaghan.ACTING: The film relies on acting and dialogue, and this film boasts an amazing ensamble cast. George Clooney gained 35 pounds in a month to quickly jump in for the role, and he does a fantastic job. Matt Damon does a great job too. Alexander Siddig gives a great performance too. I also find it strange that his character's name is Nasir in the film, and his character's name in Kingdom Of Heaven earlier this year was also Nasir. Other actors highlighting the amazing cast include Jeffery Wright, Christopher Plummer, Chris Cooper, and Tim Blake Nelson. The acting wasn't great enough to boast acting nods, but it was good enough to carry this complicated plot.BOTTOM LINE: The title Syriana comes from the latin phrase ""Pax Syriana"", which is modeled after Pax Romana, and the literal translation is Syrian peace. The film is an insightful, if not overly detailed, look into the world of corruption all for the sake of oil. The film will seem slow and boring for those who decide not to give the film their full attention. This is not a movie where you sit back and let the music and special effects do the work for you. A good film that is able to rebound with a somewhat flawed first 2 acts, is able to provide an interesting resolution.",4,"The Film Is Very Thought Provoking, It's Easy To Get Lost Though So It Demands Constant Attention",1134604800,"12 15, 2005",2005,3408,"['MOVIE', 'Syriana', 'entry', 'political', 'thriller', 'maybe', 'more', 'political', 'drama', 'similar', 'style', 'Constant', 'Gardener', 'was', 'released', 'earlier', 'year', 'film', 'filled', 'brim', 'detail', 'line', 'dialogue', 'meaningful', 'plot', 'way', 'Unfortunetly', 'can', 'be', 'times', 'where', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'follow', 'film', 'attention', 'audience', 'have', 'ADD', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'movie', 'movie', 'ensamble', 'cast', 'one', 'actor', 'really', 'out', 'main', 'character', 'can', 'argue', 'George', 'Clooney', 'main', 'character', 'then', 'again', 'Alexander', 'Siddig', 'scene', 'stealing', 'performance', 'Prince', 'Nasir', 'Al-Subaai', 'character', 'own', 'story', 'intertwining', 'plot', 'corruption', 'blackmail', 'back', 'stabbing', 'plot', 'centers', 'two', 'major', 'oil', 'companies', 'forming', 'merger', 'what', 'make', 'profit', 'how', 'power', 'abused', 'get', 'film', 'two', 'very', 'thrilling', 'scenes', 'One', 'torture', 'scene', 'will', 'actually', 'make', 'cringe', 'beauty', 'cringe', 'magic', 'editing', 'never', 'actually', 'see', 'anything', 'graphic', 'will', 'make', 'cringe', 'nontheless', 'due', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'next', 'scene', 'actually', 'climax', 'film', 'great', 'build', 'up', ""'re"", 'watching', 'intently', 'should', 'make', 'jump', 'seat', 'Now', 'political', 'side', 'film', 'new', 'production', 'company', 'Participant', 'Productions', 'company', 'goal', 'producing', 'films', 'are', 'important', 'reflections', 'world', 'events', 'still', 'making', 'entertaining', 'film', 'North', 'Country', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'were', 'released', 'year', 'participant', 'film', 'current', 'oil', 'crisis', 'going', 'middle', 'east', 'film', 'lots', 'point', 'views', 'see', 'situation', 'government', 'side', 'Arabian', 'side', 'major', 'oil', 'company', 'side', 'Unfortunetly', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'audience', 'follow', 'up', 'being', 'chore', 'watch', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'decent', 'sophmore', 'directorial', 'attempt', 'Stephen', 'Gaghan.ACTING', 'film', 'relies', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'film', 'amazing', 'ensamble', 'cast', 'George', 'Clooney', 'gained', '35', 'pounds', 'month', 'quickly', 'jump', 'role', 'fantastic', 'job', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'great', 'job', 'too', 'Alexander', 'Siddig', 'great', 'performance', 'too', 'also', 'find', 'strange', 'character', 'name', 'Nasir', 'film', 'character', 'name', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'earlier', 'year', 'was', 'also', 'Nasir', 'Other', 'actors', 'highlighting', 'amazing', 'cast', 'include', 'Jeffery', 'Wright', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'enough', 'boast', 'acting', 'nods', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'carry', 'complicated', 'plot.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'title', 'Syriana', 'latin', 'phrase', 'Pax', 'Syriana', 'modeled', 'Pax', 'Romana', 'literal', 'translation', 'Syrian', 'peace', 'film', 'insightful', 'not', 'overly', 'detailed', 'look', 'world', 'corruption', 'sake', 'oil', 'film', 'will', 'seem', 'slow', 'boring', 'who', 'decide', 'not', 'give', 'film', 'full', 'attention', 'not', 'movie', 'where', 'sit', 'back', 'let', 'music', 'special', 'effects', 'do', 'work', 'good', 'film', 'able', 'rebound', 'somewhat', 'flawed', 'first', '2', 'acts', 'able', 'provide', 'interesting', 'resolution']",N/A

But then, I felt the same about ""Traffic.""  I certainly admire the project's ambituousness--like the war on drugs, there is no easy answer to global terrorism and energy dependence, though the project doesn't mention beheadings such as the one of Nicholas Berg at the hands of al-Zarqawi in its plot about the assassinated Saudi idealist, played magnificently by Alexander Siddig with marvelous understatement and texture.Siddig's role as Dr. Julian Bashir of ""Star Trek"" fame was not a stereotypical Arab role (the character was originally called Julian Amoros), but he seems to get the terrorist roles (Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in THE HAMBURG CELL, a guest shot in ""MI5:Spooks"") as well as the idealistic ruler roles such as Feisal opposite Ralph Fiennes (where, as in ""Hamburg Cell"" Sid puts on a convincing Arab accent instead of his marvelous British) in ""A Dangerous Man,"" where Feisal got torpedoed by the West--in this case, the Brits and the French, forcing ""dangerous man"" TE Lawrence (Fiennes) to turn against his colleagues the way Clooney's Baer and Matt Damon's cynical economics expert do.Prince Nasir is a blending of Feisal and Bashir, both idealists.  My movie date and I agreed Alexander Siddig's was the best performance--with apologies to George Clooney, who convincingly did a Charlize Theron and shed his glam image, and whose torture scenes as well as the famous ""Why am I being investigated"" scene, not to mention the moment where he looks at Nasir just before Nasir buys it courtesy of Big Oil and the CIA, are excellent.  In a cast this stellar, with everyone brilliant  right down to Amanda Peet, who does drama brilliantly, it's hard to pick a standout--Jeffrey Wright is good, though his scenes with his father seem to go nowhere plotwise (although they're touching and maybe meant to humanize this lobbyist), and Chris Cooper and Christopher Plummer excellent.As for the film's assertion of American assaination and manipulation of political affairs, we all know it happens (Siddig once played scenes with William Sadler in ""Star Trek"" where the latter guest-starred as a Baer-like spy with no conscience--Sadler made an unreleased film called ""Purple Heart"" involving a US Military plot to kill Saddam Hussein). Yes, it bothers any thinking person. The other side of the coin is that covert ops have saved countless lives (and in the first gulf War, people argued we should have taken out Hussein.)  It's more troubling when the target is presented as a good guy, like Nasir, which is most likely the point.  It's worth remembering we trusted Hussein and bin Laden once upon a time.

984790,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000F7CMRM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 7]","From a rhetorical perspective ""Syriana"" is probably preaching to the choir.  The idea that oil companies are motivated by profit and will do anything to make more money today than yesterday, and even more tomorrow, has been clear ever since J.R. Ewing ran rampant on ""Dallas.""  The reality that the ""record"" gas prices of recent days are relative and less than they were during the oil crisis of the 1970s once you adjust for deflation is lost on a public that would rather keep the math simple and not bring algebra into the equation.  Oil companies make big profits and they make them off of us, but then you can say the same thing about fast food restaurants or pretty much any other American business.  Besides, there is nothing we can do about hurricanes that affect oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, but during an election year you can get politicians desperate to keep their jobs willing to babble empty promises about taking the oil companies to tasks.  It has been sixty years since the end of World War II and Nazis are too old to be functional boogeymen anymore, but the oil companies we will always have with us (well, actually, that is not true, as this film tries to indicate).The plot of ""Syriana"" is pretty complex, but the situation is relatively simple.  One the oil producing nations of the Persian Gulf signs a deal to supply its oil to China, which was what the Texas-based oil company Connex wanted to do.  Meanwhile, Killen, a small oil company, signs a deal to drill for oil in Kazakhstan, so Connex strikes a merger deal, which gets the attention of the U.S. government because there are things here that do not add up (unless you think in terms of petrodollars). ""Syriana"" was written and directed by Stephen Gaghan, who won an Oscar for Best Screenplay Adaptation for ""Traffic,"" which matters because it provides a point of reference which tells viewers that thinks are going to get complicated and convoluted before long, but in the end everything will be revealed in the fullness of time to be parts of a single pattern.  So just watch the proceedings and follow along as best you can.Involved in these machinations are a whole bunch of characters, with veteran CIA field agent Bob Barnes (George Clooney) as the film's focal point (which might sound like it is at odds with winning an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but with everybody vying for screen time it makes sense).  His counterpart in the dynamic of the film ends up being Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon), an oil trader working out of Geneva who becomes a bit more honest in the truth he speaks to power after a personal tragedy.  The cast also includes Christopher Plummer, Chris Cooper, Jeffrey Wright, Akbar Kurtha, William Hurt, and Aleander Siddig, and I refrain from identifying roles and motivations because that is something best left to you in watching the film.The relationship between Robert Baer's ""See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Solider in the CIA's War on Terrorism"" and Gaghan's screenplay is that the film is ""suggested"" by the non-fiction book.  In other words, nothing is real here, but it is expected to ring true with audiences and it probably well.  However, ""Syriana"" got me thinking: the assumption has been that President Bush has is beholden to the oil companies because they have bought him body and soul (not to mention that he tried to be an oil man once upon a time).

984793,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000F7CMRM,Linda Linguvic,"[7, 7]","This is a complex film.  It's hard to follow.  And at the end I had the feeling that it was too short, which is very unusual for me.I have no idea what the name of the film is supposed to mean.  The situations depicted are supposedly fictional although they are based on some real issues - oil, money, politics, the Middle East crisis, and corruption.  There are a lot of characters, many of whom never meet each other, but whose every action effects everything else.  George Clooney is one of the stars.  He plays a CIA agent.  We know he's a paid assassin who is fluent in Farsi and sells bombs. But we're never sure if he's a good guy or a bad guy. And when he, himself is double-crossed and is subjected to torture, we cannot help but feel sorry for him.Matt Damon's character is also confusing.  We're never sure of what his business is but he and his family live a good life in a Middle Eastern country.  When he is invited to the home of a Sheik to talk business, his young son is involved in a horrible accident.  Somehow, this gives him leverage in his dealings with the Sheik, but his wife now accuses him of selling out.Then there are the two Middle Eastern princes.  At first we dislike them both, but as the film moves along we get a sense of the competition between them.  One brother makes a deal with the Americans which will likely be a disaster for his country.  The other brother's ideals of long-range planning for the country are dashed.  But these plans include a deal with China.To complicate even more, there are two American oil companies, one of which is owned by Chris Cooper, which are merging in order to buy drilling rights in another Middle Eastern country.  But whether there is oil where they will be drilling is questionable.  There are a lot of American government investigations going on but the lawyers are all slick and corrupt and none of these investigations every resolve anything.And then there is the young ""guest worker"" in the oil-rich country who is pulled into religious fanaticism.Confused?It took me a while to get it but Syriana is SUPPOSED to be confusing.  This concept is endemic to the screenplay.  Basically the combination of politics and oil in the Middle East is one great big confusing labyrinth.  There are no easy answers.  In fact, there are no answers at all.  Everyone is a bad guy.  And everyone is connected to each other in some way.  They never realize it though as each one views the world from his own perspective.When the film was over, I wondered what the plot was about and really thought I had missed something.  And then I heard someone seated behind me ask her companion to explain the plot. I understand that professional reviewers were given a written outline of the plot before they reviewed the film.  I sure I wish I had had a roadmap like this.  But I also really think that it would have narrowed my perspective.  The reality of the film is that Middle Eastern politics are so complicated that there is no real understanding and hence, no solution.I definitely recommend this film.  I am sure it will confuse you too.  But then, the world is a complex place and there really are no easy answers.",4,Confusing but realistic depiction of  politics and oil in the Middle East,1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,3178,"['complex', 'film', 'hard', 'follow', 'end', 'had', 'feeling', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'very', 'unusual', 'me.I', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'name', 'film', 'supposed', 'mean', 'situations', 'depicted', 'are', 'supposedly', 'fictional', 'are', 'based', 'real', 'issues', 'oil', 'money', 'politics', 'Middle', 'East', 'crisis', 'corruption', 'are', 'lot', 'characters', 'many', 'whom', 'never', 'meet', 'other', 'action', 'effects', 'everything', 'else', 'George', 'Clooney', 'one', 'stars', 'CIA', 'agent', 'know', 'paid', 'assassin', 'who', 'fluent', 'Farsi', 'bombs', ""'re"", 'never', 'sure', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'when', 'double-crossed', 'subjected', 'torture', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'him.Matt', 'Damon', 'character', 'also', 'confusing', ""'re"", 'never', 'sure', 'what', 'business', 'family', 'live', 'good', 'life', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'country', 'When', 'invited', 'home', 'Sheik', 'talk', 'business', 'young', 'son', 'involved', 'horrible', 'accident', 'Somehow', 'leverage', 'dealings', 'Sheik', 'wife', 'now', 'selling', 'out.Then', 'are', 'two', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'princes', 'first', 'dislike', 'film', 'moves', 'get', 'sense', 'competition', 'One', 'brother', 'deal', 'Americans', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'disaster', 'country', 'other', 'brother', 'ideals', 'long-range', 'planning', 'country', 'are', 'dashed', 'plans', 'include', 'deal', 'China.To', 'complicate', 'even', 'more', 'are', 'two', 'American', 'oil', 'companies', 'one', 'owned', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'are', 'merging', 'order', 'buy', 'drilling', 'rights', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'country', 'oil', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'drilling', 'questionable', 'are', 'lot', 'American', 'government', 'investigations', 'going', 'lawyers', 'are', 'slick', 'corrupt', 'none', 'investigations', 'resolve', 'anything.And', 'then', 'young', 'guest', 'worker', 'oil-rich', 'country', 'who', 'pulled', 'religious', 'fanaticism.Confused', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'Syriana', 'SUPPOSED', 'be', 'confusing', 'concept', 'endemic', 'screenplay', 'Basically', 'combination', 'politics', 'oil', 'Middle', 'East', 'one', 'great', 'big', 'confusing', 'labyrinth', 'are', 'easy', 'answers', 'fact', 'are', 'answers', 'Everyone', 'bad', 'guy', 'everyone', 'connected', 'other', 'way', 'never', 'realize', 'one', 'world', 'own', 'perspective.When', 'film', 'was', 'wondered', 'what', 'plot', 'was', 'about', 'really', 'thought', 'had', 'missed', 'something', 'then', 'heard', 'someone', 'seated', 'ask', 'companion', 'explain', 'plot', 'understand', 'professional', 'reviewers', 'were', 'given', 'written', 'outline', 'plot', 'reviewed', 'film', 'sure', 'wish', 'had', 'had', 'roadmap', 'also', 'really', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'narrowed', 'perspective', 'reality', 'film', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'politics', 'are', 'so', 'complicated', 'real', 'understanding', 'hence', 'solution.I', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'film', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'confuse', 'too', 'then', 'world', 'complex', 'place', 'really', 'are', 'easy', 'answers']",N/A

It frames how oil dictates America's cow-towing to the Middle East.  Oil companies, Saudi field workers from Pakistan, Sheiks and Princes, CIA Operatives all entwine and play a high stakes game of oil contracts.  There are political games, terrorist plots and greedy corrupt people at all intersections of this complex epic.  I suspect to understand it all you need to watch it about three or four times.George Clooney plays a CIA operative who delivers two missiles to his his contact in Iran - but one disappears.  The CIA has many problems and does not focus on this at first.  The heir to an Emirate gives an oil contract to China that cuts out a US company.  This leads to the immediate firing of their immigrant field workers.  A merger with a small firm that landed a Kazakhstani oil contract causes the US Department of Justice to suspect a bribe was involved.  The oil company's law firm finds a scapegoat.  Then when a plot to kill the Emir-apparent fails, they send in Agent Bob Barnes (George Clooney) who figures out he has been used as a pawn in their game.  Matt Damon plays an American economist/trader, Bryan Woodman, who uses the death of his young son to get lucrative contracts and advise the Saudi heir that the CIA wants to kill.  All corruption (and everybody is corrupt) leads to oil.The movie is too overwhelming and complex to enjoy and you end up tuning out parts that don't make any sense until late in the story.

Gaghan, a screenwriter from the movie ""Traffic"", gives us more of the same, set in the Middle East.  Oil permeates the film.  It oozes and flows, drawing the central symbol, greed...from everyone it touches.Drawn from the book by Robert Baer, ""See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism"", Syriana makes a political statement of what can happen when America intervenes in the complicated beehive of middle east politics and leaders.  Ignore it.  Don't take sides, don't draw parallels.  Just see the movie for what it is and not what it tries to be.It is a series of harsh vignettes, made all the more real by the camera work.  It is a dark and brutal movie set in the Arabian sunshine.  It is full of a mix of characters (and phenomenal actors) and you can't always tell the good from the bad.There are parables - the young man (Matt Damon) blessed with a gift of precise analytics and believable soundbites, who chooses to dabble in an industry that is full of corruption, without being corrupted himself.  In the film he loses his innocence and nearly loses the family that is the anchor of what he really is.The road warrior (George Clooney) - who is the antithesis of what we think CIA operatives are, and who probably portrays them more closely to the truth of many agents.  He's driven by what he's seen after years in Iran, tainted by knowing too much and yet not enough, overweight and old, with nothing in his family life to compel him to get out of the way of disaster.  He's a used man, and he knows it, but he can't stop himself.  There is a scene of his torture in the film that is all too brutal, but it doesn't do what we think it will do....reform George into a force for good.  Instead, he is bound by his own need to play a part in the conclusion that leaves the filmgoer wondering if he achieved the outcome he sought, or if he was too late to change the outcome.There is the fixer - Jeffrey Wright as an attorney who is challenged to be a ""lion not a lamb"" as he investigates the complex series of events that leads up to a merger of oil companies.  The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act takes center stage here, and Wright finds himself in league with Chris Cooper, who is the reluctant bridegroom in the marriage.  Wright's character's family life is dominated by an alcoholic father, who keeps showing up inebriated on Wright's doorstep....a genteel reminder that he can't escape his past.There is the arresting presence of Alexander Siddig, as the visionary older prince, son of a powerful emir.  There is the return of Christopher Plummer, again, to the big screen, in a role in which he is deliciously villainous.Lastly, there is the story, all too worrisome, of the young Arab (I could not distinguish the name of the actor) who is living poorly as a stranger in a strange land, and whose vulnerability will ultimately lead him to terrorism.The movie is being compared to ""Traffic"", but it is not ""Traffic""...it does not unite the audience, it leaves them puzzled.  It does not glorify its topic, but neither does it complete its agenda, if it has one; only leaves the viewer feeling uneasy and worried.  Perhaps that IS the agenda.  It is visually stunning, completely worthy of a view by someone who goes to the movies NOT to be entertained, but to be open to a new story.  It is far too ambitious for its boundaries.

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[6, 6]","""Syriana"", directed by Stephen Gaghan, is an engaging film that tackles many different stories at the same time. All of them have something in common, though: the oil industry, and the people that have some kind of relationship with it.Despite the fact that it is a little difficult to keep track of the diverse stories that ""Syriana"" comprises, it is well worth the effort, due to the fact that it allows the spectator to understand what is at stake for different people in the oil industry, and how a decision made by one of them affects the rest. What does Bob (George Clooney), a CIA operative, has to do with a poor immigrant who works in an oil field, or with a young reformist prince (Alexander Siddig)? And what do a broker (Matt Damon) and a lawyer (Jeffrey Wright) that don't know each other have to do with all of them? Oil, power, corruption and manipulation are the main subjects in ""Syriana"". This film is fiction, but some of its elements could well be truth, and that makes you think.On the whole, I think ""Syriana"" is a complicated movie, but one that deserves your time and attention.

As in ""Traffic"" Gaghan sets up a situation in which Oil, not drugs is an obsession, a sickness really...the real stuff of life and he peoples his movie with those who support and thrive on his thesis: the C.I.A, the Arab Nations, the US oil companies. People are victimized, blown-up, tortured, brutalized and even  murdered in service of the all-mighty pursuit of black gold.Writer/Director Stephen Gaghan (writer of ""Traffic"") has the sense though of making the proceedings global yet often times heart breakingly personal which only makes his film more persuasive, more contemporary, more like real, rather than reel, life.George Clooney, bloated and bearded and not looking at all like the ""Worlds Sexiest Man"" plays a C.I.A. agent, Bob Barnes: a work-horse agent...one who is sent out on missions as a scapegoat, one who is not expected to succeed but time and time again completes his missions to the utter dismay of his superiors: whereas all of his contemporaries are earning raises and respect, he earns neither and in fact he is abhorred for his expertise: definitely a case of someone who gets the job done his own way and does not follow the party line: a rebel. Why? It's never really explained but it is obvious that Barnes is an outsider: a man more sinned against than sinning. And even with the extra 20 pounds, grey beard and baggy, shapeless clothes, Clooney has never been more effective: he's gruff, he's gross, he's driven but he is nonetheless a good guy...someone who always has the big picture in mind and sees and understands the forest despite the trees.We, the audience view much of the action and plot of ""Syriana"" en Medias re: we eavesdrop on many scenes as they are unfolding rather than at their inception: a device that was used to great advantage in ""Traffic"" and ""Gosford Park."" This process keeps us off-balance and psychologically on our toes: we pay close attention just to ""keep up"" and Gaghan, always the consummate storyteller punctuates his films with the rational and irrational stuff that makes us all human. There is also a dark, foreboding, mean-spirited and dangerous side to the story Gaghan is telling here: how do you differentiate the light without the dark? How do you know what is Evil without knowing the Good?""Syriana"" is bravura filmmaking in the best sense: universal yet coming from a personal place. In fact there is a verisimilitude about ""Syriana"" that is chilling and frightening: is there indeed a wolf pack of rabid Washington honchos pulling and manipulating the strings that control the world's oil supplies?

984815,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000F7CMRM,mirasreviews,"[5, 9]","""Syriana"" is a disjointed political thriller that seems to want to comment on the United States' anti-terrorist efforts and its fight for Big Oil profits being at cross-purposes, resulting in ineffective policies, corruption, and third world strife. The film was inspired by former CIA operative in the Middle East Robert Baer's book ""See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Solider in the CIA's War on Terrorism"". The events in the film are fiction, but they address some of the issues that Baer discusses in his book. And the film's CIA agent Bob Barnes was modeled on Baer.The merger of fictional American oil giant Connex and the smaller company Killen raises red flags at the justice department when Killen's acquisition of drilling rights in Kazakhstan comes under scrutiny. Connex asks lawyer Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) to investigate the issue, hoping to find and contain any improprieties before the government does. Meanwhile, energy analyst Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is trying to woo the Emir of a powerful, oil-rich Persian Gulf nation on behalf of his company and ends up a close advisor to the Emir's progressive son Prince Nazir Al-Subaai (Alexander Siddig). The U.S. Presidential administration wants desperately to believe that the religious government in Iran will fall to secular reformers, which CIA operative Bob Barnes (George Clooney) knows is impossible. So the CIA gives him another assignment: Assassinate Prince Nazir, who is expected to resist American pressures concerning oil, and military bases. In the Gulf, a young Pakistani guest worker (Mazhar Munir) is fed up with poor treatment and desperate circumstances, and a fundamentalist imam is only too happy to show him another way.""Syriana""'s ideas are provocative: Big Oil. Big Corruption. Policies that label people as ""terrorists"" for political reasons while supporting regimes that foster fanaticism because they are economically friendly. But these ideas are introduced haphazardly and never really explored. ""Syriana"" is a mess of disparate elements that leave the audience wondering when they will all come together but never achieve coherence. It takes nearly half of the film just to provide background to this convolution, which is accomplished by frenetically jumping between storylines. The camera work is aloof, seeming as though we are eavesdropping on the action. The result is that characters never engage and the stories never draw us in. Even within the scenes, there is far too much cutting. I felt like I was watching cuts more than I was watching the film.Director Stephen Gaghan (who is usually a screenwriter) needs to learn how to use the camera. Stick with those shots. Let scenes play out. No wobbly handheld work. If the camera is stationery, then don't move it. Don't distance the audience from the action. And more realism couldn't hurt. For all the power the United States has in the Persian Gulf, I doubt its ability to influence the succession to the Saudi throne. The heir to the throne is determined by his relation to Ibn Saud. I'd love to see a good, challenging film on the subject of foreign policy and oil interests. But I think that audiences will come away from ""Syriana"" more bewildered than enlightened about what happened and why. (The screenplay is available for download on the film's web site.)The DVD (Warner Brothers 2006): Bonus features include 3 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer (2 min), and 2 interview segments. In ""A Conversation with George Clooney"" (9 min), Clooney discusses the real Robert Baer, how the movie was constructed from the book, and the ensemble nature of the film. Somehow he imagines ""Syriana"" is apolitical. ""Make a Change, Make a Difference"" (11 min) includes interviews with Clooney, Robert Baer, director Stephen Gaghan, Matt Damon, and the film's producers, among others. They discuss the film's themes, oil consumption, and the consequences of oil dependency. Subtitles are available for the film in English, French, and Spanish.

The movie is very fast paced, from the dialogues to just cutting from scene to scene.  It's not helped with the fact that some of the economic theories and ideas that are brought up are sometimes hard to understand, and since it goes so fast you don't always have time to understand them, which I thought put a damper on the film because it then becomes harder to follow everything that's happening.  But in a way, it makes sense, because like the characters, we don't fully realize what's happening right away.But overall, it's a movie I'd recommend, and I think definitely worth seeing, as it tackles important issues that we face today and faces them head on, and with a second viewing, everything becomes a lot clearer and easier to understand, which gives the movie a whole new perspective and makes it all that more important.",3,"Not too bad, but not the best either",1146096000,"04 27, 2006",2006,1297,"['movie', 'basically', 'corruption', 'oil', 'business', 'private', 'businesses', 'government.The', 'movie', 'all-star', 'cast', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'etc', 'hit', 'marks', 'rather', 'well', 'such', 'complex', 'movie.In', 'general', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'far', 'ideas', 'forward', 'quite', 'thought', 'provoking', 'up', 'important', 'issues.But', 'ideas', 'are', 'good', 'hard', 'follow', 'movie', 'very', 'fast', 'paced', 'dialogues', 'just', 'cutting', 'scene', 'scene', 'not', 'helped', 'fact', 'economic', 'theories', 'ideas', 'are', 'brought', 'up', 'are', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'understand', 'so', 'fast', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'time', 'understand', 'thought', 'put', 'damper', 'film', 'then', 'harder', 'follow', 'everything', 'happening', 'way', 'sense', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'fully', 'realize', 'what', 'happening', 'right', 'away.But', 'overall', 'movie', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'think', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'important', 'issues', 'face', 'today', 'head', 'second', 'viewing', 'everything', 'lot', 'clearer', 'easier', 'understand', 'movie', 'whole', 'new', 'perspective', 'more', 'important']",N/A

Period !!People seem appalled by the mention of this solution, but to me that's a symptom of how soft we have become.... we dont ever fix things today because people are unwilling to take the steps needed.If we are unwilling to do what must be done to fix things, then stop talking about them, because they are not going to go away on their own despite the wishful thinking of many unrealistic and idealistic softies in our society today.In all fairness, I went to this movie expecting not to like it, but that is not always a predicter of a bad review.A really good movie can win you over.Originally I was never interested in seeing SHAWSHENK REDEMPTION, DOOR TO DOOR or THE STRAIGHT STORY.... but all three (3) of those movies now rate a 5-star for me and are among my favorites.",1,Contortion of the book upon which it suppoedly was based,1134172800,"12 10, 2005",2005,3197,"['Watching', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'choice', 'lost', 'bet', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected.I', 'am', 'familiar', 'book', 'SEE', 'NO', 'EVIL', 'written', 'ex-CIA', 'operative', 'name', 'now', '.Oddly', 'enough', 'movie', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'common', 'book.I', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'what', 'expect', 'Clooney', 'Damon', 'involved.One', 'impression', 'Hollywood', 'producers', 'bought', 'film', 'rights', 'book', 'order', 'add', 'sense', 'authenticity', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'CIA', 'operative', 'who', 'truth', 'firsthand', 'then', 'securing', 'rights', 'went', 'ahead', 'made', 'anti-American', 'propaganda', 'film', 'intended', 'do', 'along.It', 'must', 'be', 'horrible', 'live', 'so', 'much', 'self-hatred', 'negativity', 'mind', 'EVERYTHING', 'world', 'massive', 'scandal', 'conspiracy.This', 'film', 'demonstrate', 'why', 'big', 'difference', 'society', 'today', 'Democrats', 'Liberals.They', 'are', 'NOT', 'same.A', 'democrat', 'guy', 'Leiberman.A', 'liberal', 'misguided', 'borderline', 'deranged', 'nut', 'Howard', 'Dean', 'Ted', 'Kennedy', 'much', 'Hollywood', 'crowd', 'who', 'make', 'films', 'attempt', 'mold', 'people', 'minds', 'own', 'agendas.Summary', '.If', 'have', 'studied', 'history', 'have', 'worked', 'intelligence', 'government', 'and/or', 'have', 'connections', 'uncle', 'was', 'FBI', '30', 'years', 'retiring', 'did', 'independent', 'operations', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'can', 'give', 'glimpse', 'what', 'scenes', 'will', 'shake', 'head', 'movie', 'yet', 'example', 'how', 'simplistic', 'unrealistic', 'certain', 'portion', 'extreme', 'left', 'society', 'otherhand', 'entire', 'view', 'world', 'limited', 'mind', 'molding', 'stories', 'get', 'mainstream', 'media', 'will', 'probably', 'praise', 'film', 'telling', 'way', 'brother', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'produced', 'directed', 'supposed', 'ex-drug', 'addict', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'informational', 'accurate', 'Afterwards', 'learned', 'was', 'made', 'same', 'creative', 'minds', 'who', 'did', 'TRAFFIC', 'also', 'found', 'be', 'lousy', 'film.Maybe', 'get', 'tired', 'people', 'analyzing', 'problems', 'discussing', 'problems', 'studying', 'problems', 'making', 'lifetime', 'career', 'working', 'problems', 'instead', 'simply', 'SOLVING', 'them.To', 'handling', 'illegal', 'drugs', 'easy', 'solution', 'society', 'really', 'cared', 'course', 'executing', 'people', 'found', 'guilty', 'buying', 'and/or', 'selling', 'illegal', 'substances..', 'Period', 'People', 'seem', 'appalled', 'mention', 'solution', 'symptom', 'how', 'soft', 'have', 'become', 'dont', 'ever', 'fix', 'things', 'today', 'people', 'are', 'unwilling', 'take', 'steps', 'are', 'unwilling', 'do', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'fix', 'things', 'then', 'stop', 'talking', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'go', 'away', 'own', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'many', 'unrealistic', 'idealistic', 'softies', 'society', 'fairness', 'went', 'movie', 'expecting', 'not', 'like', 'not', 'always', 'predicter', 'bad', 'review.A', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'can', 'win', 'over.Originally', 'was', 'never', 'interested', 'seeing', 'SHAWSHENK', 'REDEMPTION', 'DOOR', 'TO', 'DOOR', 'THE', 'STRAIGHT', 'STORY', 'three', '3', 'movies', 'now', 'rate', '5-star', 'are', 'favorites']",N/A
984821,A1S5B32WYMEE44,B000F7CMRM,"M. Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[8, 11]","Gaghan has now made two similar powerful films that have something to say on the more important issues of the current times.  That is no small feat.  Like Jonathan Swift writing ""Gulliver's Travels:"" Joseph Heller and ""Catch 22; or better yet Don DeLillo writing ""Underworld"" or ""White Noise,"" Gaghan reveals something that necessarily isn't being said too widespread about modern times and does it in such a way that it is hard not to listen and doubly it's hard not to be engaged and entertained while listening.The performances are all fine here is ""Syriana.""  A hefty Clooney does quite a turn portraying CIA agent, Bob.  Matt Damon is very believable as a family man who gets mixed in the middle through a loss and chain of fate events in the big business in the Middle East that is oil.  Jeffrey White as the private lawyer hired by the Department of Justice, Bennett Holiday, perhaps tops them all in a understated, truly believable, lion of a role.Just as in Gaghan's ""Traffic,"" multiple story lines are woven together to get at the bigger picture that is either the next ""Great Game"" of energy business or the Global War on Terrorism depending on the way you look at it.  So of course the weighty issues of the United States and the international community is, as its always been, economic, religious, historical, violence veiled in power and international relations, but mostly and at the very core of it all...it's about people.  ""Syriana,"" finds a way to tell the story of the people that make up the drama of terrorism and the fight against it...of international energy commerce and the people that fight for it, in it, against it, and with it.There are several silent explosions throughout ""Syriana.""  A Stinger goes off in Iran?  A Hellfire missile is lofted from a Predator against a Saudi Emir.  A misguided youth guides a small fishing vessel very accurately against an oil tanker (ala the USS Cole) and each explosion brings light.  We don't get to hear the big Hollywood boom (thank you Stephen Gaghan) but we do get commentary about how lives rise from the ashes.  Matt Damon's character, after a near death experience, gets re-centered and grounded in the importance of family and being there for the ones closest to you, the ones you love.  A young man commits suicide for another person's cause with the hope to bring his Mother from Pakistan to Saudi Arabia to be with his father.  These are stories that need to be told because these are stories that are happening and wrapped up in our collective current events.What does Syriana mean?  It's an unfortunate named film indeed but what gives it additional intrigue is that the film's script was inspired from Robert Baer's (ex CIA agent) expose book, ""See No Evil.""  It makes you wonder (as does ""Traffic"") how much of the story line is based on real world events.  There may even be an appearance by Condi Rice in the movie...see if you can catch it.So, this movie is a must see for those that care about the issues that face the modern world.  Some may find the multiple story lines off-putting and some may find the political issues a tad boring (my Mother-in-law for one did...whom made it through half the movie with me), but I say watch it.

It comes down to greed, and greed is there in spades from the US government to the US oil companies to the wealthy arab monarchies to the insurgents with a larger agenda. Through it all, lives are wasted. On both grand and intimate scale, the bad guys are custom building a whole new circle of hell. Your heart will race, especially as the inevitable conclusion bears down.Clooney is brilliant in this. So is Jeffrey Wright and the Arab actor who plays the ""good"" prince. The bad guys from Christopher Plummer on are just seething with evil. The only episode that is superfluous is Matt Damon's subplot. It's tear-jerker stuff, whose conclusion is the only improbability in the whole film. Costa Gavres would have left him on the editing floor. But, no matter. For Gaghan, this film is a triumph.

984830,A2VK365XEVCYC8,B000F7CMRM,One More Option,"[5, 8]","A common criticism reviewers have made of this movie is that the plot is either too hard to follow or it does not make sense.  Not all storytelling is designed to have a linear, easy to understand plot.  The plot was complex, but not impossible to follow.  This movie is also an exercise in giving us glimpses of worlds that are more complex than we probably initially understand.  And the movie asks:  How should we respond to things that are both foreign and violent to us?The movie reminds us there are real, violent wars going on throughout the world right now.  It does not benefit a person to pretend they are not going on.  But as individuals, we can choose how to ""fight"" in these conflicts.  We can, as the characters in this film, channel 'good intentions' into violence, misinformation, boundaries, and silence in order to promote our positions.  Or we can, as the filmmakers and actors in this film, use sharing information, artistic expression, & filmmaking to illustrate the problems created by violence, misinformation, boundaries and silence.""You're a good man . . . your entire career you've been used.  And probably never even known what for,"" Christopher Plummer's character says to George Clooney's character, a CIA soldier.There is a scene in this movie where a car drives through a Beirut suburb.  It shows gunmen posted on rooftops every few blocks.  It's important to remember that as boundaries grow, more men are needed to ""guard"" those boundaries.  Guards have little time to use their creative skills or craft solutions.  To enable real, long term solutions, we need innovative ideas & non-discriminatory policies that encourage mechanical and social engineers, and lessen the need for boundaries and security guards.For all the movie's plot complexity, it's moral message focuses primarily on the problem side of the equation, suggesting that the pursuit and control of oil makes us bad.  To avoid conceding we need oil is probably as misguided as avoiding conceding there are constant battles being fought to control it.  What the movie does not do well is to show workable diplomatic, governmental, systemic, and alternate energy suggestions for solving the problems inherent in any competition for a limited resource.  We need more than Matt Damon drawing the shortest distance between 2 points in the sand, and the prince monologuing about what he'd like to do, but hypocritically does not do.A key to bringing peace out of any conflict is to remove the scarcity by creating alternate energy sources, improving sharing efficiencies, or reducing consumption.  We need brilliant filmmakers, economists, social scientists, and engineers to take the next steps and suggest practical energy solutions.  In the long run, that will do far more towards creating world peace than old policies that call for more gunmen standing around.  I'd like to see an equally good film on that side of the problem solving equation.  It would be a more difficult film to make than a film that mainly explains the causes of the problems, but it would be a worthwhile film to make.",4,"Syriana helps us understand the causes of the conflicts, but what will bring more hope for the future?",1165363200,"12 6, 2006",2006,3090,"['common', 'criticism', 'reviewers', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'plot', 'either', 'too', 'hard', 'follow', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'Not', 'storytelling', 'designed', 'have', 'linear', 'easy', 'understand', 'plot', 'plot', 'was', 'complex', 'not', 'impossible', 'follow', 'movie', 'also', 'exercise', 'giving', 'glimpses', 'worlds', 'are', 'more', 'complex', 'probably', 'initially', 'understand', 'movie', 'How', 'should', 'respond', 'things', 'are', 'foreign', 'violent', 'movie', 'are', 'real', 'violent', 'wars', 'going', 'world', 'right', 'now', 'not', 'benefit', 'person', 'pretend', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'individuals', 'can', 'choose', 'how', 'fight', 'conflicts', 'can', 'characters', 'film', 'channel', ""'good"", 'intentions', 'violence', 'misinformation', 'boundaries', 'silence', 'order', 'promote', 'positions', 'can', 'filmmakers', 'actors', 'film', 'use', 'sharing', 'information', 'artistic', 'expression', 'filmmaking', 'illustrate', 'problems', 'created', 'violence', 'misinformation', 'boundaries', 'silence', ""'re"", 'good', 'man', 'entire', 'career', ""'ve"", 'been', 'used', 'probably', 'never', 'even', 'known', 'what', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'character', 'George', 'Clooney', 'character', 'CIA', 'soldier.There', 'scene', 'movie', 'where', 'car', 'Beirut', 'suburb', 'gunmen', 'posted', 'rooftops', 'few', 'blocks', 'important', 'remember', 'boundaries', 'grow', 'more', 'men', 'are', 'needed', 'guard', 'boundaries', 'Guards', 'have', 'little', 'time', 'use', 'creative', 'skills', 'craft', 'solutions', 'enable', 'real', 'long', 'term', 'solutions', 'need', 'innovative', 'ideas', 'non-discriminatory', 'policies', 'encourage', 'mechanical', 'social', 'engineers', 'need', 'boundaries', 'security', 'guards.For', 'movie', 'plot', 'complexity', 'moral', 'message', 'primarily', 'problem', 'side', 'equation', 'suggesting', 'pursuit', 'control', 'oil', 'bad', 'avoid', 'conceding', 'need', 'oil', 'probably', 'as', 'misguided', 'avoiding', 'conceding', 'are', 'constant', 'battles', 'being', 'fought', 'control', 'What', 'movie', 'not', 'do', 'well', 'show', 'workable', 'diplomatic', 'governmental', 'systemic', 'alternate', 'energy', 'suggestions', 'solving', 'problems', 'inherent', 'competition', 'limited', 'resource', 'need', 'more', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'drawing', 'shortest', 'distance', '2', 'points', 'sand', 'prince', 'monologuing', 'what', ""'d"", 'like', 'do', 'hypocritically', 'not', 'do.A', 'key', 'bringing', 'peace', 'conflict', 'remove', 'scarcity', 'creating', 'alternate', 'energy', 'sources', 'improving', 'sharing', 'efficiencies', 'reducing', 'consumption', 'need', 'brilliant', 'filmmakers', 'economists', 'social', 'scientists', 'engineers', 'take', 'next', 'steps', 'suggest', 'practical', 'energy', 'solutions', 'long', 'run', 'will', 'do', 'far', 'more', 'towards', 'creating', 'world', 'peace', 'old', 'policies', 'call', 'more', 'gunmen', 'standing', 'around', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'equally', 'good', 'film', 'side', 'problem', 'solving', 'equation', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'difficult', 'film', 'make', 'film', 'mainly', 'causes', 'problems', 'would', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'make']",N/A

Syriana is full of gaping potholes and fuzzy motivations in addition to having a mess of a narrative structure.  More crucially, if you are looking for a good political film, Syriana fails completely as a thriller.  Harkening back to films like the very good Three Days of the Condor and the superb, mind-blowing Chinatown, the film assumes that our government is still acting in secret on behalf of big business, as if there were secret conspiracies driving our government that we don't know about.  Hello?!!  Former and failed oilman Bush openly invaded Iraq and we are still occupying it.  What conspiracy?  Everything is out in the open with Bush and his cronies.  If something criminal is leaked, like Bush signing an illegal order to allow spying on Americans without a court order, Bush just defiantly keeps doing it.  Syriana, which totally avoids Iraqiana, is very reassuring to the Right even though it intends to be a liberal film.  According to the film, the U.S. government (Congressmen and CIA) as well as oil men are TOTALLY in control and entirely successful at achieving their agenda.

984837,ADE852UR9121C,B000F7CMRM,perfecto,"[8, 13]","If I can sum this movie up in a phrase, it would be ""disturbingly real"". This movie is right in your face, with it's political and socio-economical views, that I was left in awe when the movie ended. This has got to be one of the best movies I've seen in a while. I'm sure it took some guts to make this movie, and I can see why it's creating a whole lot of controversy.First of, I will give a quick recount of what's happening in the movie, and trust me...this is the tricky part. The movie's frames are sliced with different scenes, different takes on different events going on. They are however linked, some more than the others. It basically involves a merger between 2 large oil companies, the corruption and deal-making behind it. How the power players squeeze situations to their advantage. There's also a succession of a Middle Eastern ruler which of course has it's own problems. There's also another angle where a couple of Pakistani youths are driven to terrosism.While all that seems a little too much to digest, I thought it was written very well. It is not as detailed as I would've liked it to be, but that would require a 10-hour movie, if not longer simply because the issues tackled in this movie are very relevant in today's world. They provide a glimpse of what happens, or what could be happening behind the issues we read about in newspapers everyday. And the beauty of the script is, they take a look it it from a global and personal perpective as well. We are shown news reports, similar to what we watch in CNN, only to reveal shady proceedings that are inconsistent with what is being reported. Does this in a way, reflect what is really happening? We never know, which brings me to my next point. This movie uncovers a lot, yet leaves a lot to the viewer to decide. For example, I really felt for the Pakistani boys who got lured into terrorism. Keep in mind, I DO NOT condone terrorism of any kind but it was definitely an eye-opener to see things from the other side of the spectrum. It's sad that many people join terrorist causes, not because of religion or what they believe in but because of ignorance and abuse. After watching the movie, my friends and I were involved in a heated debate about various parts of the movie and how many movies can do that?The amazing script is strengthened with exceptional performances from some of the best actors in Hollywood including Matt Damon, Christopher Plummer, Chris Cooper and William Hurt. But the star that outshines them all has got to be George Clooney. Who knew the doctor from ER had it in him. It's like he redeemed himself from all the mediocre/cringe-worthy (Batman and Robin anyone?) performances he's ever given us. He's character is not the main one here, yet everytime he appears...he astounds me with the degree of perfection he plays his character. Throughout the movie, he is ragged yet skillful, confused yet determined and  pulls of the character very well. Soon, the acting disappears and he's a CIA agent. I suspect he'll get an Oscar nomination for which, I for one thinks he truly deserves. These actors not only brought some talent to the movie, but they also took it to an emotional level. You feel for the characters, you begin to look at things their way, you care and want to understand what they're going through, how their mind works.A lot has been said about the plot being confusing. Well, I understood the movie and so did everyone I spoke to. And no, I'm not a political science student or the chairman of a large conglomerate. True, some parts of the movie were filled with jargon used in the business/oil world and world politics, but if you're nitpicking on that fact, I believe you're missing the whole point. This movie offers so much more than what is being shown to us. By making this movie, director Stephen Gaghan paints a few broad strokes of an unusually large canvas that makes us question the values of life, of business and war, of what's really important. I think, if the movie was able to do that..it is successful. Brilliantly conceived and well executed.

I do agree with the other reviewers that it is a bit hard to follow, and tends to get off-track at times, but if the subject of oil or geopolitics interests you, it is well worth it. Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't see how it was over-hyped, since most people I've mentioned it to have never even heard of it.I thought the film had a ring of authenticity to it, especially since it is loosely based on the memoirs of former CIA agent Robert Baer. As the film goes on, you see the connection between the American and middle eastern governments, oil companies, and Islamic fundamentalists as they come together in a complex web of espionage, business deals, and terrorism. The underlying message is clear, oil makes the world go round.Overall, I thought Syriana was a solid political film.

You have an intense and violent mix of interests:  kings (and succession), oil companies, parts of the US government, mysterious fixers, and religious fanatics, combined with impoverished youth and lack of opportunity.  From the much-abused CIA operative (Clooney), the viewer perceives that there is something complex and violent afoot, which  spirals out of control once economic interests, ambition, and power interests emerge.The greatest fun of the film, in its non-linear presentation, is that it is left to the viewer to connect the dots.  COnnections are implied, but rarely spelled out and tied off only behind the scenes.  Everything is deliciously just below the surface.  For example, Clooney meets an old colleague in Beirut, a link to Hezbollah; they are buddy-buddy, then suddenly the guy becomes his torturer, sparing his life only when a Hezbollah chief unexpectedly appears.  This messes up Clooney's career machinations in DC.  Very little of what he was trying to do and why is clear, but there are allusions to it later.  It is wonderfully cryptic, but the viewer senses that it all fits in the end.  I don't want to say more because getting there is more than half the fun.This makes for a multi-layered experience that can be viewed many times, particularly if the viewer is interested in mid-East politics and history.

984854,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000F7CMRM,Robert Moore,"[8, 10]","The best movies are subtle affairs, with room and space to notice wonderful minutiae, such as marveling over the way John Ford frames John Wayne in the doorway as it closes at the end of THE SEARCHERS or Marcello Mastroianni straining unsuccessfully to hear what the young girl representing innocence is yelling at him on the beach at the end of LA DOLCE VITA.  But I don't know if SYRIANA contains such subtleties or not.  The plot narrative was so convoluted; so complex, and so inexpertly laid out that it took all my concentration to keep up with what was happening.  The movies have seen a host of profoundly complex films over the years.  Even Raymond Chandler was said not to quite understand what was happening in Howard Hawks's version of THE BIG SLEEP.  My guess with this film is that the script started off as a huge, incoherent mess, and in subsequent rewrites they only barely managed to make it intelligible.  If there is subtlety in the film, I was working too hard to notice it.The movie's ultimate incoherence is a shame, because it contains many otherwise excellent things.  For instance, it is one of the rare films that has attempted to address some of the issues associated with globalization and one of the few that tries to show how astonishingly interrelated the world has become.  Decisions undertaken in Houston or Washington or London or Beijing can work to fuel much of the anger and alienation that has fueled what we in the West call terrorism but which in other parts of the world are viewed as acts of self-defense.  The film is to be commended for resisting the stupidity inherent in the assumptions that the Arab world ""hates us because of our love of freedom"" or other mindless platitudes.  The film tries to explain that what seems to us to be irrational acts are to those committing terrorist acts completely rational.  Furthermore, the film also tries to explain why a very large number of nations around the world regard the United States consider the United States engaged in terrorism, seen in the smart bomb killing of a reformist sheik.For most Americans the story of the United States intervening to keep a unqualified and unpopular but pro-Western ruler in charge of a Middle Eastern country instead of a far more popular, competent, but anti-Western ruler will be completely unfamiliar.  But this plot element has deep overtones in the Gulf Region.  The first deep intrusion by the CIA into foreign affairs was the coup they orchestrated in 1953 to remove Mohammed Mossadegh from power in Iran and insert the Shah in his place.  The parallels to the story told in the film are palpable.  Mossadegh was far more democratically minded, far more progressive, and far more in favor of making life better for most Iranians, but he was also intent on keeping Iran's oil wealth from flowing almost exclusively to Western corporate entities.  In this film, our reformer wants to align himself more closely to the Chinese, an arrangement that benefits his fictional country far more than one with the United States.  I have not read Baer's original book nor have I heard details, but I would be willing to bet that the Mossadegh incident was a prime inspiration for the story.As I said, I commend the intellectual seriousness of the film and its attempt to lay out the current global situation and to try to explain some of the issues at the heart of Middle Eastern politics, but at no point in this film can I say that I enjoyed it.  It is more a film that you respect than like.  It was lacking the human element found in all good films.  It was more like watching a Middle Eastern textbook in film version.The cast was exceptionally solid, but because of the limitations of the script, no one really stood out.  George Clooney was enjoyable, playing a completely burned out CIA spy.  I think most of the attention, however, that his role is receiving is related more to his playing against type and having gained so much weight for the role.  There are a large number of competent performances, but given the complexity of the narrative and the huge number of performers, no one really stands out.  It was interesting to see Alexander Siddig in his role of the reform-minded prince.

984855,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000F7CMRM,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 10]","****1/2How can a movie be THIS compelling and engrossing, yet still be so difficult to follow?  That is the question I found myself asking all the way through ""Syriana,"" a fascinating political thriller that keeps you riveted to your seat for well over two hours yet is almost completely incomprehensible for most of that running time.  The mark of a great filmmaker usually lies in how well he is able to illuminate a complex subject for a less-than-enlightened or essentially uninformed audience.  In this case, however, writer/director Stephen Gaghan's refusal - or is it inability? - to unravel the entanglements in his narrative somehow works in the movie's favor.  Is it because the subject matter itself is so messy and incoherent that the presentation of it needs to be as well?  Whatever the case, ""Syriana"" is a wholly riveting and absorbing cinematic experience - even if only a tiny percentage of it makes any real sense.  (And don't forget that coherence of plot, in and of itself, is not necessarily a prerequisite for a quality film.  After all, it`s widely admitted that the screenplay for ""The Big Sleep"" is virtually impossible to figure out, yet that film is considered a classic).Based on the book by Robert Baer, Gaghan's tale takes us to the dark heart of international oil politics, where strategies are planned and deals are struck, often at the expense of individual freedoms and the snuffing out of thousands of innocent lives.  Gaghan shows us the behind-the-scenes wheeling and dealing, power politics, corporate corruption, governmental malfeasance, human exploitation and personal betrayals that go into filling up the gas tanks of our SUVs.  In this turbulent Middle Eastern world of sectarian strife, arms deals and acts of terror, Gaghan finds little room for good guys or heroes, although he does imply that heroic ACTS may indeed be possible.  Instead, he shows how all of us, to some degree or another, share in this shame.Rather than taking a purely linear approach in his narrative (which would certainly have made things more understandable) , Gaghan, as he did in ""Traffic,"" provides us with an assortment of characters and storylines that often seem arbitrary and disconnected from one another.  This is primarily why the confusion arises, for we are often whisked from one subplot to another before the first has been fully explicated.  The film is something like a mosaic; it doesn't really matter if every single detail doesn't attain complete clarity as long as we are able to pull back and focus our eyes on the big picture Gaghan shows us.There's not much point in trying to relate the fine points of the complex plot here.  Suffice it to say that the film is filled with vivid scenes and memorable moments, as well as outstanding performances by George Clooney, Matt Damon, Christopher Plummer, Chris Cooper, Amanda Peet, Kayvan Novak, Amr Waked and many others.By plunging headlong into the most timely and important issue of our time - the violent clash between Western secularism and Muslim extremism - ""Syriana"" certainly establishes itself as one of the bravest and best movies of 2005.  However, it may take a few additional viewings on the part of the head-scratchers to convince THEM of that.",4,The Art of Incoherence,1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,3248,"['****1/2How', 'can', 'movie', 'be', 'THIS', 'compelling', 'engrossing', 'still', 'be', 'so', 'difficult', 'follow', 'question', 'found', 'asking', 'way', 'Syriana', 'fascinating', 'political', 'thriller', 'riveted', 'seat', 'well', 'two', 'hours', 'yet', 'almost', 'completely', 'incomprehensible', 'most', 'running', 'time', 'mark', 'great', 'filmmaker', 'usually', 'how', 'well', 'able', 'illuminate', 'complex', 'subject', 'less-than-enlightened', 'essentially', 'uninformed', 'audience', 'case', 'however', 'writer/director', 'Stephen', 'Gaghan', 'refusal', 'inability', 'unravel', 'entanglements', 'narrative', 'somehow', 'movie', 'favor', 'subject', 'matter', 'so', 'messy', 'incoherent', 'presentation', 'be', 'as', 'well', 'Whatever', 'case', 'Syriana', 'wholly', 'riveting', 'absorbing', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'even', 'only', 'tiny', 'percentage', 'real', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'coherence', 'plot', 'not', 'necessarily', 'prerequisite', 'quality', 'film', 's', 'widely', 'admitted', 'screenplay', 'Big', 'Sleep', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'figure', 'out', 'yet', 'film', 'considered', 'classic', '.Based', 'book', 'Robert', 'Baer', 'Gaghan', 'tale', 'dark', 'heart', 'international', 'oil', 'politics', 'where', 'strategies', 'are', 'planned', 'deals', 'are', 'struck', 'often', 'expense', 'individual', 'freedoms', 'snuffing', 'thousands', 'innocent', 'lives', 'Gaghan', 'behind-the-scenes', 'wheeling', 'dealing', 'power', 'politics', 'corporate', 'corruption', 'governmental', 'malfeasance', 'human', 'exploitation', 'personal', 'betrayals', 'go', 'filling', 'up', 'gas', 'tanks', 'SUVs', 'turbulent', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'world', 'sectarian', 'strife', 'arms', 'deals', 'acts', 'terror', 'Gaghan', 'little', 'room', 'good', 'guys', 'heroes', 'imply', 'heroic', 'ACTS', 'may', 'indeed', 'be', 'possible', 'Instead', 'how', 'degree', 'share', 'shame.Rather', 'taking', 'purely', 'linear', 'approach', 'narrative', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'made', 'things', 'more', 'understandable', 'Gaghan', 'did', 'Traffic', 'assortment', 'characters', 'storylines', 'often', 'seem', 'arbitrary', 'disconnected', 'one', 'primarily', 'why', 'confusion', 'are', 'often', 'whisked', 'one', 'subplot', 'first', 'been', 'fully', 'explicated', 'film', 'something', 'mosaic', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'single', 'detail', ""n't"", 'attain', 'complete', 'clarity', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'able', 'pull', 'back', 'focus', 'eyes', 'big', 'picture', 'Gaghan', 'not', 'much', 'point', 'trying', 'relate', 'fine', 'points', 'complex', 'plot', 'here', 'Suffice', 'say', 'film', 'filled', 'vivid', 'scenes', 'memorable', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Kayvan', 'Novak', 'Amr', 'Waked', 'many', 'others.By', 'plunging', 'headlong', 'most', 'timely', 'important', 'issue', 'time', 'violent', 'clash', 'Western', 'secularism', 'Muslim', 'extremism', 'Syriana', 'certainly', 'one', 'bravest', 'best', 'movies', '2005', 'However', 'may', 'take', 'few', 'additional', 'viewings', 'part', 'head-scratchers', 'convince', 'THEM']",N/A

Writer/director Stephen Gaghan denies the audience the ensuing carnage of the explosion and, in a sense, the point of his polemic. Through several storylines Gaghan unravels a corrupt American government in collusion with corrupt American oil business to establish capitalist democracy in Iran for the sake of raping its economy while thwarting democracy in another Middle Eastern country because its reformist emir dares to sell his oil to the Chinese.""Syriana"" does not lack hope for its depiction of this corrupt collusion, because Gaghan makes clear there is recourse against such corruption: The boy, with the bomb, on his dinghy will, as Tyler Durden scarily intones in ""Fight Club,"" reset things back to zero. The best way to thwart power, Gaghan argues implicitly, is to play by power's rules - stab it in the gut until it bleeds, and commit oneself to death. It worked in Vietnam. It gave America pause on 9/11. And, Gaghan argues, it's all that keeps the power brokers honest. If ""Syriana"" is hopeless, it's because it's nihilist, not because it's too angry to see through its tears.Gaghan - who won an Oscar for his adaptation of ""Traffic"" - is an insightful, talented guy. But he's made a movie too busy  - ""complex"" is word used by critics who agree with his rant and so pretend movies should resemble a first affirmative constructive in high school debate - to develop a heart for any of the characters nor peddle a thesis that wasn't covered in ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""A CIA assassin named Bob, played by fattened George Clooney, generates the most press because he's played by fattened George Clooney. I personally could've cared less about how he's suddenly frozen out by his government, nor the plight of lawyer Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) who's assigned to investigate the merger of one of his firm's clients, which lost oil rights to the Chinese, to a much smaller oil company, which unexpectedly gained rights in Russia. Is it is a corrupt merger? Does a ribeye steak taste good?The only plot that seems new is that of an American energy analyst Bryan Wortman (Matt Damon) hired as lead consultant by Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig) an Oxford/Georgetown scholar ready to drag his nation into the 21st Century by breaking the hold America has over his country's oil. His dying father only need name him emir over that hapless cad of a brother. Damon's analyst pulls no punches with his new client, partially because his son has accidentally died in the Prince's pool, and he thinks the job is a payoff - which it is. But the Prince really is prepared to heed his advisor's advice, to develop the economy, give women the right to vote, transform the region. Except that he sold oil to the Chinese. In a world of dwindling oil resources, your regular American Hummer owner can't afford that shortage in supply.Gaghan has something in this storyline, a kind of modern ""Lawrence of Arabia."" Damon and Siddig establish immediate chemistry; Damon makes a great policy wonk looking for a guy to believe in, and Siddig broadcasts that dashing political brilliance Kennedy enjoyed. Nasir's cause is a decent one, his eventual fate we can mourn, and all the Gaghan's aims can be translated through his struggle.We get one-fourth of that movie. Gaghan is more committed to his narrative skills. Let it be said the movie has several compelling images: Bob meeting an informant at the sea in Lebanon, then later having his fingernails pulled out by this same man; remarkable displays of Arabian opulence; a shot of a beautiful Iranian woman slipping a birka over her sexy party clothes at sunrise; young Arab boys watching videos of ""martyrs"" describe their eventual funerals.In short, ""Syriana"" is best described as a wordy, preachy mood piece that seeks the reflect ""the mood"" or ""the climate"" or ""the complexity"" of the modern world, and to show off how much it knows about the tyranny of the few in majority. It's that guy you know who has an addendum for every news bit you saw on TV. Of course I admire it, and one wishes we all had two years to photograph beautiful Iranian women and stage a scene at that six-star hotel in Dubai while nominally in pursuit of the schematic that blows the lid off this cloaked universe of power. Gaghan will get applause from the critic crust but he fails to grasp what captivates Americans: You can interlock four stories about the moral complexities of assisted suicide; or you can make ""Million Dollar Baby"" and close the picture with Saint Clint Eastwood eating key lime pie in a diner beside a box of Academy Awards. Americans like heroes, ""Syriana"" has none, and a story like this needs one.Because here's the deal: We're all paying through the nose for gas at the pump and Exxon recently reported record profits for last quarter. Is it corrupt? Is it corrupt? Can I pay eight bucks for the ribeye steak? What we need are personal stories, straight, tough, real, but personal. That, or the second coming of Howard Hughes - independently wealthy, bizarrely fixated on wind and solar power, and willing to tell oil executives to kiss both sides of his rump. Maybe he could date Amanda Peet, another perfectly gorgeous woman who is also in this movie.",3,"Too busy, too preachy, yet compelling",1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,5431,"['Critics', 'who',

As Clooney says in the special features, the star of this film is the screenplay.With Clooney's ""Bob"" loosely based on Bob Bauer( to hear more of Bob Bauer, check out his commentary on RED ), this has plenty of realism from the intelligence side, and the consultants are not party political, but as they emphasize, they aim at being a-political; however, I am aware that me saying that is not going to be agree-able to some. Since the film reveals the structure of what happens, and as one producer says, those people doing things that  we might think as morally questionable do not see them as such, in fact they have very good arguments to support their side. So, as stated a few times, its not all black and white but more grey, with plenty of scope for questions.This is a brilliant watch with a superb finish.The extras show some great material, and the deleted scenes are great, and I would question why they were deleted.A note about second hand items: I bought this accidentally as second hand ( I thought I had bought a new copy); I did not worry since it was Amazon, and I thought with a rating of ""Used"" Very Good"", I thought it would be great. Well, the digital break up at the start and finish of the film is extreme for a ""Very Good"" copy, and might be passable for Good or ""Okay"", but not ""Very Good"".I will avoid second hand movies in the future.Meanwhile I will hopefully be able to buy a new copy somewhere.",5,"A Classic, Brilliant in all Respects",1297468800,"02 12, 2011",2011,1453,"['movie', 'superb', 'Clooney', 'special', 'features', 'star', 'film', 'screenplay.With', 'Clooney', 'Bob', 'loosely', 'based', 'Bob', 'Bauer', 'hear', 'more', 'Bob', 'Bauer', 'check', 'out', 'commentary', 'RED', 'plenty', 'realism', 'intelligence', 'side', 'consultants', 'are', 'not', 'party', 'political', 'emphasize', 'aim', 'being', 'a-political', 'however', 'am', 'aware', 'saying', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'agree-able', 'film', 'structure', 'what', 'one', 'producer', 'people', 'doing', 'things', 'might', 'think', 'morally', 'questionable', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'such', 'fact', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'arguments', 'support', 'side', 'So', 'stated', 'few', 'times', 'not', 'black', 'white', 'more', 'grey', 'plenty', 'scope', 'questions.This', 'brilliant', 'watch', 'superb', 'finish.The', 'extras', 'show', 'great', 'material', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'great', 'would', 'question', 'why', 'were', 'deleted.A', 'note', 'second', 'hand', 'items', 'bought', 'accidentally', 'second', 'hand', 'thought', 'had', 'bought', 'new', 'copy', 'did', 'not', 'worry', 'was', 'Amazon', 'thought', 'rating', 'Used', 'Very', 'Good', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'Well', 'digital', 'break', 'up', 'start', 'finish', 'film', 'extreme', 'Very', 'Good', 'copy', 'might', 'be', 'passable', 'Good', 'Okay', 'not', 'Very', 'Good', '.I', 'will', 'avoid', 'second', 'hand', 'movies', 'future.Meanwhile', 'will', 'hopefully', 'be', 'able', 'buy', 'new', 'copy', 'somewhere']",N/A
984862,A155KXFRZCA7C,B000F7CMRM,"scherf.com ""scherf.com""","[6, 11]","Similar to ""Traffic"" this motion picture ""Syriana"" is composed of several stories about the lives and destinies of individuals under one big umbrella. While in ""Traffic"" most of the various individuals from the different stories never meet, in ""Syriana"" it all comes together and it is interwoven.The Arab world behind the scenes is very well captured in this film and it certainly was one of George Clooney's best roles ever. The good part was that finally George wasn't running around like a $20+ million actor, instead he plays a somewhat likeable CIA agent with the ""usual"" ""modern"" dysfunctional family-type of thing.At times the storyline seems to touch only the surface of the issues without digging deeper, but then it's a motion picture and not a documentary. I don't know what some people meant with the liberal left agenda being promoted in this film ... I don't think it had much to do with it other than there's a touch of ""conspiracy"" theory packed into this flick, but otherwise it  showed quite a bit of the reality of how international business is conducted even in our days.Matt Damon plays his part well too and of course it's not a Bourne Identity/Supremacy performance because his role is minor. The film has been well executed and you've got to be prepared to think watching this film ... so it's not some relaxing flick for a cozy Saturday afternoon. In the end there are some loose ends, but that's why we have an imagination to figure out such things by ourselves. It's well worth watching this film and the filmmaker is taking us on a journey around the globe introducing us to a world most folks won't be familiar with -- it's very interesting, although it has a rather sad undertone.While ""Syriana"" shows us the big Oil biz, I would say that Alec Donzi's excellent thriller ""The Consultant"" (only a book so far) shows us in similar fashion the big Nuke biz around the world -- and I hope that they'll make a movie of Alec Donzi's ""Consultant"" too ... this would be really great.",4,Very interesting and sad!

984863,A1O7C0RN447LIH,B000F7CMRM,Scott Burton,"[15, 17]","""Syriana"" isn't the convoluted film it's accused of being, but it does require a few things of the viewer. Before you watch, you need to have accepted a few ideas about the oil industry and U.S. foreign policy that Americans have been educated not to accept.First, you have to accept that the goal of the United States, and for that matter every industrialized nation on Earth, is not the peaceful advancement of civilization for its' peoples. No world power is spared - China and Russia are called out as up-and-coming players in the dirty game. Damon's character points it out clearly - every major treaty & action in the region since World War I has been about strategic access to oil. It is literally a fight to the death to determine which worldly powers control it.Second, you have to accept that oil actually is ""running out"". Oil wells don't exactly ""run dry"", but they can be depleted to the point where it's no longer trivial to continue extraction. Fewer and fewer new oil fields are being found, and the oil industry's focus has made a steady move away from exploration of new fields, and towards technologies to further exploit existing ones. This means that, while the world doesn't neccesarily face a crisis of oil shortage, the easy work is behind us; oil companies face ever more difficult, expensive technical challenges in the future in order to guarantee supply. This is known as ""Peak Oil"".Third, you have to accept that money, power and ideology make strange bedfellows. Seedy, corrupt connections like the ones between lawyers, U.S. government officials and the oil industry would easily be dismissible as paranoid fantasy if it weren't for the rich plunder of oil. The Bob Baer character finds himself surrounded by enemies within his own agency, but a friend to a coup plotter. Damon's character allows the promise of radical change in the region to split apart his family. The incongruity starts to make sense when viewed through the lens of Syriana.And last, you have to accept that in a struggle such as this one, all parties are willing to go to extraordinary lengths to achieve what they see as the right ends.This film has been lauded as a ""wake up call"" about America's complicity in the violent regional conflicts surrounding oil-rich nations; I don't think it's that. No smoking gun is revealed, no single event demonized, no accusation is made. You will learn nothing new here if you've glanced at a copy of The Economist or The New York Times in the last 20 years. I don't think the aim here was to ""lift the blanket"" off of a problem most Americans are already willing to acknowledge exists.And to call the film ""unamerican"" is short-sighted as well. Everyone finds a straw man to beat; journalist Amir Tehiri considers it anti-Arab. Capitalists would call it ""anti-capitalist fantasy"". It's hard to sustain any of these claims, because nothing in the film is really that shocking. Americans have woken up to new charges of corruption, globalism and anti-Arab violence in the papers every single day of 2006.  A simple reading of practicallly any newspaper in the U.S. today would indicate massive corruption, illegality and doublespeak on the part of government and industry oil-related or not, that far outstrips any controversial aspect of the film Syriana. If you have to concoct a criticism of Syriana as to its realism, you would have to conclude that the film itself is far too tame.The criticism most frequently leveled at this movie is that it's convoluted, hard to follow, maybe intentionally confusing. I didn't find that to be the case - in fact, you only need a basic understanding of oil and geopolitics in order to follow the story. I found the large number of characters to be a stumbling point though. Also, some of the story's most critical junctures involving kingmaker Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer's character) are quickly glossed over and left (maybe intentionally) vague. In a traditional film, Whiting would be the villain, and it's unfair I think to leave him so unconnected. One would assume that Whiting is the nexus of powerful forces in the oil industry lobby, the U.S. government and the oil-producing states, but it's all to vague to be certain. We are left to guess at the exact nature of what is, essentially, the hand pulling all of the strings. In a film where every plot device has a clear real-world analog, it's unfair to leave ambiguous such a central point.""Traffic"" shared this problem. Such is the nature of Gaghan's finger-pointing. The weighty bundle of innuendo is often left to hang by a precious thread, unconnected to reality and dangling precipitously.",4,Compelling,1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,4642,"['Syriana', ""n't"", 'convoluted', 'film', 'accused', 'being', 'require', 'few', 'things', 'viewer', 'watch', 'need', 'have', 'accepted', 'few', 'ideas', 'oil', 'industry', 'U.S.', 'foreign', 'policy', 'Americans', 'have', 'been', 'educated', 'not', 'accept.First', 'have', 'accept', 'goal', 'United', 'States', 'matter', 'industrialized', 'nation', 'Earth', 'not', 'peaceful', 'advancement', 'civilization', 'peoples', 'world', 'power', 'spared', 'China', 'Russia', 'are', 'called', 'out', 'up-and-coming', 'players', 'dirty', 'game', 'Damon', 'character', 'points', 'out', 'clearly', 'major', 'treaty', 'action', 'region', 'World', 'War', 'been', 'strategic', 'access', 'oil', 'literally', 'fight', 'death', 'determine', 'worldly', 'powers', 'control', 'it.Second', 'have', 'accept', 'oil', 'actually', 'running', 'out', 'Oil', 'wells', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'run', 'dry', 'can', 'be', 'depleted', 'point', 'where', 'no', 'longer', 'trivial', 'continue', 'extraction', 'Fewer', 'fewer', 'new', 'oil', 'fields', 'are', 'being', 'found', 'oil', 'industry', 'focus', 'made', 'steady', 'move', 'away', 'exploration', 'new', 'fields', 'towards', 'technologies', 'further', 'exploit', 'existing', 'ones', 'world', ""n't"", 'neccesarily', 'face', 'crisis', 'oil', 'shortage', 'easy', 'work', 'oil', 'companies', 'face', 'ever', 'more', 'difficult', 'expensive', 'technical', 'challenges', 'future', 'order', 'guarantee', 'supply', 'known', 'Peak', 'Oil', '.Third', 'have', 'accept', 'money', 'power', 'ideology', 'make', 'strange', 'bedfellows', 'Seedy', 'corrupt', 'connections', 'ones', 'lawyers', 'U.S.', 'government', 'officials', 'oil', 'industry', 'would', 'easily', 'be', 'dismissible', 'paranoid', 'fantasy', 'were', ""n't"", 'rich', 'plunder', 'oil', 'Bob', 'Baer', 'character', 'surrounded', 'enemies', 'own', 'agency', 'friend', 'coup', 'plotter', 'Damon', 'character', 'promise', 'radical', 'change', 'region', 'split', 'apart', 'family', 'incongruity', 'make', 'sense', 'when', 'viewed', 'lens', 'Syriana.And', 'last', 'have', 'accept', 'struggle', 'such', 'one', 'parties', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'extraordinary', 'lengths', 'achieve', 'what', 'see', 'right', 'ends.This', 'film', 'been', 'lauded', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'America', 'complicity', 'violent', 'regional', 'conflicts', 'surrounding', 'oil-rich', 'nations', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'smoking', 'gun', 'revealed', 'single', 'event', 'demonized', 'accusation', 'made', 'will', 'learn', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', ""'ve"", 'glanced', 'copy', 'Economist', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'last', '20', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'aim', 'here', 'was', 'lift', 'blanket', 'problem', 'most', 'Americans', 'are', 'already', 'willing', 'acknowledge', 'exists.And', 'call', 'film', 'unamerican', 'short-sighted', 'as', 'well', 'Everyone', 'straw', 'man', 'beat', 'journalist', 'Amir', 'Tehiri', 'anti-Arab', 'Capitalists', 'would', 'call', 'anti-capitalist', 'fantasy', 'hard', 'sustain', 'claims', 'nothing', 'film', 'really', 'shocking', 'Americans', 'have', 'woken', 'up', 'new', 'charges', 'corruption', 'globalism', 'anti-Arab', 'violence', 'papers', 'single', 'day', '2006', 'simple', 'reading', 'practicallly', 'newspaper', 'U.S.', 'today', 'would', 'indicate', 'massive', 'corruption', 'illegality', 'doublespeak', 'part', 'government', 'industry', 'oil-related', 'not', 'far', 'controversial', 'aspect', 'film', 'Syriana', 'have', 'concoct', 'criticism', 'Syriana', 'realism', 'would', 'have', 'conclude', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'tame.The', 'criticism', 'most', 'frequently', 'leveled', 'movie', 'convoluted', 'hard', 'follow', 'maybe', 'intentionally', 'confusing', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'case', 'fact', 'only', 'need', 'basic', 'understanding', 'oil', 'geopolitics', 'order', 'follow', 'story', 'found', 'large', 'number', 'characters', 'be', 'stumbling', 'point', 'Also', 'story', 'most', 'critical', 'junctures', 'involving', 'kingmaker', 'Dean', 'Whiting', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'character', 'are', 'quickly', 'glossed', 'left', 'maybe', 'intentionally', 'vague', 'traditional', 'film', 'Whiting', 'would', 'be', 'villain', 'unfair', 'think', 'leave', 'so', 'unconnected', 'One', 'would', 'assume', 'Whiting', 'nexus', 'powerful', 'forces', 'oil', 'industry', 'lobby', 'U.S.', 'government', 'oil-producing', 'states', 'vague', 'be', 'certain', 'are', 'left', 'guess', 'exact', 'nature', 'what', 'essentially', 'hand', 'pulling', 'strings', 'film', 'where', 'plot', 'device', 'clear', 'real-world', 'analog', 'unfair', 'leave', 'ambiguous', 'central', 'point', 'Traffic', 'shared', 'problem', 'Such', 'nature', 'Gaghan', 'finger-pointing', 'weighty', 'bundle', 'innuendo', 'often', 'left', 'hang', 'precious', 'thread', 'unconnected', 'reality', 'dangling', 'precipitously']",N/A

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[3, 6]","Syriana is a good but complicated film directed by Stephen Gaghan (writer of Traffic) and starring Ocean's Eleven stars George Clooney and Matt Damon, Christopher Plummer (The Sound Of Music), and Chris Cooper (American Beauty).The movie focuses on America's oil interests in the Middle East, and how 'America' with its manipulations, CIA operatives, and foreign agents is able to control the flow of oil in the world.An Arabian Gulf prince, played by Alexander Siddig, whose country is not specifically named, is interested in taking over as king after his ailing father dies so he can develop his country into a powerful economic force with open trade with countries like China, something he knows will disappoint America and Europe. His father, as a result of pressure from the west, chooses his youngest son, a spoiled prince with only money on his mind, as his follower to the throne. Matt Damon plays the prince's economic advisor who believes in his client's ambitions and realizes that he can get richer as his permanent consultant despite going through a family tragedy where his son dies and his wife leaves him to return to America.In another corner in the globe, George Clooney is a CIA operative who discovers he's being used by his government for risky operations, such as a trip to Lebanon to assassinate the ambitious prince, which leads him to a torture chamber where his nails are pulled out with pliers.In the meantime, an oil drilling company has shut down and is sold to another American firm which leads to the unemployment of a number of foreign workers mainly from Pakistan. Two youths, who were amongst those fired, are lured in becoming suicide bombers. Their target: the same big company that took them out of work.What the different events in the movie lead to in the end is one conclusion: that America only cares for itself; that it is the reason why everything that is viewed as evil to the world is happening, while the victims are those that are used and abused by the system of American foreign policy; and that it will get its way and what it wants no matter what.Syriana is a risky Hollywood feature; a very interesting movie with a brand new theme in modern day cinema. The acting and screenplay, which will most definitely be nominated for the Best Original Screenplay oscar, makes the movie pass by at easy pace for the viewers. Clooney's performance is captivating, and worthy of an Oscar nomination. While the performances of Damon, Plummer, Cooper and even Amanda Peets and Alexander Siddig are excellent secondary role players; expect to have a couple of Supporting Actor nominations also.The movie is not for everyone. I am sure that many people will fall asleep or become restless by the end of the movie. But it will provoke you to think about it for a long time. This is why I recommend it only to those who like the 'thinking' movies.B",4,Syriana anti-Americana,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,2883,"['Syriana', 'good', 'complicated', 'film', 'directed', 'Stephen', 'Gaghan', 'writer', 'Traffic', 'starring', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'stars', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Sound', 'Music', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'American', 'Beauty', '.The', 'movie', 'focuses', 'America', 'oil', 'interests', 'Middle', 'East', 'how', ""'America"", 'manipulations', 'CIA', 'foreign', 'agents', 'able', 'control', 'flow', 'oil', 'world.An', 'Arabian', 'Gulf', 'prince', 'played', 'Alexander', 'Siddig', 'country', 'not', 'specifically', 'named', 'interested', 'taking', 'over', 'king', 'ailing', 'father', 'dies', 'can', 'develop', 'country', 'powerful', 'economic', 'force', 'open', 'trade', 'countries', 'China', 'something', 'will', 'disappoint', 'America', 'Europe', 'father', 'result', 'pressure', 'west', 'youngest', 'son', 'spoiled', 'prince', 'only', 'money', 'mind', 'follower', 'throne', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'prince', 'economic', 'advisor', 'who', 'client', 'ambitions', 'can', 'get', 'richer', 'permanent', 'consultant', 'going', 'family', 'tragedy', 'where', 'son', 'dies', 'wife', 'return', 'America.In', 'corner', 'globe', 'George', 'Clooney', 'CIA', 'operative', 'who', 'being', 'used', 'government', 'risky', 'operations', 'such', 'trip', 'Lebanon', 'assassinate', 'ambitious', 'prince', 'torture', 'chamber', 'where', 'nails', 'are', 'pulled', 'out', 'meantime', 'oil', 'drilling', 'company', 'shut', 'down', 'sold', 'American', 'firm', 'unemployment', 'number', 'foreign', 'workers', 'mainly', 'Pakistan', 'Two', 'youths', 'who', 'were', 'amongst', 'fired', 'are', 'lured', 'becoming', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'target', 'same', 'big', 'company', 'took', 'work.What', 'different', 'events', 'movie', 'lead', 'end', 'one', 'conclusion', 'America', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'everything', 'viewed', 'evil', 'world', 'happening', 'victims', 'are', 'are', 'used', 'abused', 'system', 'American', 'foreign', 'policy', 'will', 'get', 'way', 'what', 'matter', 'what.Syriana', 'risky', 'Hollywood', 'feature', 'very', 'interesting', 'movie', 'brand', 'new', 'theme', 'modern', 'day', 'cinema', 'acting', 'screenplay', 'will', 'most', 'definitely', 'be', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'oscar', 'movie', 'pass', 'easy', 'pace', 'viewers', 'Clooney', 'performance', 'captivating', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performances', 'Damon', 'Plummer', 'Cooper', 'even', 'Amanda', 'Peets', 'Alexander', 'Siddig', 'are', 'excellent', 'secondary', 'role', 'players', 'expect', 'have', 'couple', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'nominations', 'also.The', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'am', 'sure', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'fall', 'asleep', 'become', 'restless', 'end', 'movie', 'will', 'provoke', 'think', 'long', 'time', 'why', 'recommend', 'only', 'who', 'like', ""'thinking"", 'movies.B']",N/A

Gaghan's film incorporates multiple story lines which he is only barely able to hold together in his portrait of what is now called ""The Clash of Civilizations,"" but the film's incoherence may in fact be its strength, as Gaghan correctly refuses to provide simple answers about the oil companies, the US government, and Islamic fundamentalism. He forces the viewer to immerse himself in a chaotic realm, a realm of greed, betrayal, and conflicting values. George Clooney gives probably his most likeable performance to date as Bob Barnes, a CIA operative in Beirut who is captured and tortured, and then sold out by the government. Matt Damon is also good as a corporate analyst determined to make a splash off of a family tragedy with a Gulf prince, and Jeffrey Wright plays a corporate lawyer trying to aid the merger of two major oil companies. All of the acting is solid, and the footage of the Middle East is quite beautiful, yet it evokes the danger and uncertainty of the region. Syriana unfortunately suffers from largely poor and amateurish directing (Gaghan's first attempt at filming his script), employing I suppose a cinema verite mode of shaky cam, trying to recapture the feel of a documentary, but its only comes across as contrived and self-aggrandizing.

984876,A21XDUIO2A4B8J,B000F7CMRM,Stephen Paul Ives-Butterfield,"[1, 4]","--SPOILER ALERT--""Syriana"" is just one fictional epic journey among thousands that your govt and oil industry have taken for you in order to comply with your demands for gasoline and fuel oil.  Its a journey of deliciously good greed, globally winning corruption, absolutely minimized collateral damage, and the wonderful people at the middle-top of the Great American Empire who already have a place in Neo-Con Heaven.The American people have dictated this path for their govt and oil industry with their demands for gasoline and heating oil.  We-the-fascist-corporatism are just the innocent little church mouse in this terrible situation.  We've tried, cried, and yelped for help from the people, but there's no help coming.  So we do the best we can with what little we have.Here's ""Syriana"", one magnificient story detailing (DETAILING) what we have to do to get what the people demand.  See for yourself how we manage our resources with an astronomical amount of honor, an absolute minimum of human anguish, and only a tiny amount of unfortunate wholesale slaughter.  Of course we can't name names or places, or identify anything anywhere, but we give you all the details worth reporting.  And, of course, we have to scoot the story around a lot so that our enemies can't figure out what we're doing to them or what we're doing to defend ourselves, but you'll fit it all together.I wouldn't have had that take on ""Syriana"" without watching the DVD's special features.  Going through those special features is a jaw-dropper.  The players and filmmakers really do want to sell that drivel.They're trying to persuade us that the fascist-corporatism of Big Oil and U.S. govt are the good guys.  They want us fit all the fragments of ""Syriana"" together so that corporatism comes out looking good, and so that it must not come out looking any way but good.BUT NO, IT CAN'T BE DONE.  ""Syriana"" is somebody's cutsey idea of playing CYA for Big Oil and its govt puppets.  ""Syriana"" is so deep into sophistic fictions that, once real-world truths are laid alongside the film's sophistic fictional lies, there's nothing that fits together in there except dishonor, corporate greed, human anguish, political corruption, and needless death.And that's after you try to make it work as a story of how the good, honorable people tried, and tried, and tried -- but, oops, missed it by just that much, when the CIA-launched missle nails the good-guy CIA dude (George Clooney's Bob Barnes) and the good-guy Arab prince (Alexander Siddig's excellently-played Prince Nasir Al-Subaai) in the same boom.Good-honorable doesn't work -- nuuhh uuuhh.  What works is the same depraved persuasion fronted by sophistry that Big Oil has been hitting us with since John D. Rockefeller.Classical rhetoric's persuasion is based on truth and ethical intent.  Human community works best when persuaded with truth.Classical sophistry's persuation is based on plausible falsehoods and unethical intent.  There are lies in any sophistry--no matter how plausible--intended to make the bad guys look good.From the fall of the kings in ancient Greece and Rome, about 500 BCE, sophists made fortunes for themselves and their clients--both in the lawcourts and in teaching their students how to bend lies into softness and nearly into truth.  Machiavelli picked it up in the 1500s.  Then, in 1776, the American monied elites, Jefferson's ever-arrogant ""natural aristocracy"", found themselves standing squarely in the time warp that made sophists right for them, too.It took me several viewings to get all the way around ""Syriana"".  There's so much sophistry--and the sophistry is so well executed and so chopped up with fractured storytelling and chop-away editing--that, initially, the sophistries kept pointing me off.I'm just not accustomed to that level of sophistication in sophistry hurling.  Haven't seen its like since my last reading of Alexander Hamilton's writings in the ""Federalist Papers"".  Usually sophistry comes at me in sophmoric mental vomit chunks, dropping away from the main spew, allowing sidestepping and chunk labeling on the fly.  Most sophists today are unskilled sophomores.Remember now, you can't find the word, 'sophistry', correctly defined in any dictionary published after about 1776.  That's when it became important to the U.S. monied elites to neuter and de-horn classical sophistry into something more modern and less threatening to their bamboozling of ordinary Americans.They didn't need ordinary citizens springboarding from Aristotle and Cicero's anti-sophistry writings to Machiavelli's 1532 preachments on deception in ""The Prince"", and on into their own deceptions.The wonderful ""Gentlemen"" judges who denied the rights of the rabble to instruct their legislatures--from 1776 to 1786--deserved protection.  It was our first national debate, and it was bitter.  It was so acromonious that most of the winners' text books today don't even mention it.  To find its descriptions, you have to get into really esoteric history books, such as Gordon S. Wood's 1969, ""The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787"", published for the Institute of Early American History and Culture at Williamsburg, Virginia.  (If you don't read another book in your life, read that one.  Bring a jaded eye.  Wood sides with the bad guys.)In 1750s-1780s America, instructing legislatures was an imperfectly understood fragment of direct democracy from the Roman Republic.  However, instructing legislatures was Republican theory tenaciously grasped by ordinary Americans.  The ""Gentlemen"", in 1776, saw that it could ruin pie-in-the-sky fortunes for coming generations of future ""Gentlemen"", who had the natural right to take whatever wealth and power they could.  (Still think they do.)  'Instructing legislatures' needed to be stamped out right now.  Against the dogged refusals of the rabble to knuckle under to the ever-arrogant Gentlemen, there was nothing left to do but to hit them with vacuous arguments, deluxe sophistry, and tyrannical power.Then, just in the nick of 1786 time, up jumped Alexander Hamilton, the Great Falsehood--self-serving suck-up hero to generals and the superrich, Grand Master of Black-Arts Sophistry.  He would deliver the Gentlemen and untold generations of their progeny into control of their fates.  He would deliver mastery over the commoner-rabble and all the industries that the Gentlemen could ever invent -- gold in the Plains Indians' sacred Black Hills and the black gold of Big Oil, for two examples.The line from Hamilton's 1786 sophistry to the ""Syriana"" sophistry fending for Big Oil and the Great American Empire is unbroken and linear.Hamilton scurried around to all the right people, autumn 1786, setting up the ""Federal Convention"" (read, Constitutional Convention) for summer 1787.  The rabble's right to instruct their legislatures went soundlessly moot.  The Constitutional Convention would settle everything.Then, from May to September 1787, Hamilton honcho'd the ""Federalist"" faction at the Constitutional Convention.  He dotted the eyes and crossed the tees that ensured slavery made it over the abyss, that the rabble could never control the Gentlemen's govt (e.g., judges made independent so that the superrich could easily buy them), and that this new Constitution would illegally and unconstitutionally side-step the standing Constitution's deadly requirements for any amendment of its fundamental law.Convention delegates who were offended by gross denial of truth were driven off (setting a tradition that still holds today --bad guys stay to drive good guys away).  Commoner rabble giving instructions to the Gentlemen's National Congress?  Not ever, sir.I'm winging it here, of course. Lots of ground to cover between ""Syriana"", its very sophisticated sophistry, and our national beginnings, with their very sophisticated sophistry.  The ground is already stuck together for all time.  We've just got to wing over it so that you can see the unbroken connection.Sophistry is how the monied elites have always led ordinary Americans around by the nose, misleading us into thinking that we're free--so that we can be more thoroughly enslaved to them and their progeny.  Black Arts sophistry is lying with the appearance of telling the truth.Ordinary Americans of the Revolutionary Era trusted the educated ""Gentlemen""--their leaders in the War--to give them the govt promised in the Declararion Of Independence (DOI)--their very own sentiments put down on paper by Thomas Jefferson.It was about self-evident truths and inalienable rights.  Govts deriving just powers from the governed, and with their direct consent.  Govts not complying altered or abolished by order of the people as a matter of right and duty.  New govts having restrictions and limits dictated by order of the people and based on nothing more than the people's pleasure.The DOI was the central propaganda of the War, read at most military and civilian gatherings, nailed to buildings far and wide.  Think major recruiting poster.  You join us, you get to kill tyrannical Englishmen, and you get to have this perfect govt.  One of my 5-g grandfathers, Jonas Butterfield, Dunstable, Mass, suckered for the punch.  Like all patriots, he and his family endured deep war-time hardships for the sake of the DOI's ideal govt.The comparison between the first paragraphs of the DOI and the govt delivered in the 1787 Constitution engineered by Hamilton and the good ol' boys is Proof One.  They did us wrong.What Hamilton and his Federalist deceivers gave ordinary Americans in the 1787 Constitution was the contradiction of the govt promised in the DOI.  It was a deep betrayal of the war-torn patriots and their progeny.  It was a govt intended to preserve the superrich and their parasites forever--tyranny, simply put.It was dispicable behavior by the ""Gentlemen"" heaped onto ordinary Americans, slavery and all.  Hamilton showed them the way.We also have the ""Federalist Papers"".  They're Proof Two.They're Hamilton's vacuous arguments, incredible sophistic lies, and clear mis-uses of obscure Aristotlean logic forms--all designed to blind ordinary Americans while leading them into the trap govt that would ensure superrich domination forever.Roll on, St.Burr.Yes, I'm the one who sainted Aaron Burr in 1969 for his fatal shooting of Hamilton, the Great Falsehood, in 1804.  I'm not alone in my sentiments.  John Adams, 2nd U.S. President, also read Hamilton in the ""Federalist Papers"" and knew his character better than me.  In 1815, Adams wrote that Hamilton was ""the most restless, impatient, artful, indefatigable, and unprincipled intriguer in the United States, if not in the world"".  (He was commenting on Gen Washington's taking of Hamilton as his 2nd in command, while rejecting St.Burr's application to be a lowly Brigadier General, War of 1812, because St.Burr was an intriguer.)St.Burr, one vote from being the 3rd U.S. President and still the sitting 3rd U.S. Vice-President when he gunned down Hamilton, was a man whose few, stand-tall principles conflicted with most others of his ""Gentlemen"" class.  He believed women were the equal of men--taught his daughter several languages and how to shoot from horseback.  He believed that slavery should be abolished, bringing a bill to that effect when he was elected to the New York State Assembly, 1784--some 79 years before Lincoln did the deed.  He was deeply tied to truth.  Talked the talk AND walked the walk.  He believed that dispicable behavior from a ""Gentleman"" was too dishonorable to be allowed.It was that last bit that pulled Hamilton by his forked, dispicable tongue into the long grind to the famous duel with St.Burr, who put a 54-caliber ball through Hamilton's liver.  This, despite Hamilton's strategem of supplying pistols--his right as the one challenged--that had concealed single-set triggers.We have one of the original pistols, and replications have been produced.  They are Gentlemen's pistols, but not proper dueling pistols.  They look normal enough.  There's just one trigger in each.  No suspicious buttons, levers, or latches, as appear on some set-trigger pistols of the period.  True to Hamilton's devious character, however, there's a trick:  push trigger forward to set.  Counter-intuitive, as are the truths that lay hidden in the tightest of sophistries.  Pistol triggers are for pulling to you, not for pushing away.Hamilton was too street-dumb to think that wiley, war-wise St.Burr might know about these widely-used pistols owned by Hamilton's brother-in-law.  Certainly, in Hamilton's conniving mind, St.Burr would not know to push the trigger forward one click to set it for a half-pound-pull, avoiding the 10-12-pound pull of using the trigger un-set.  Hair trigger means more accuracy than heavy trigger.  Ha-ha, Hamilton had his hated nemesis now, on that bright Wednesday New Jersey morning, 11 July, Weehawken dueling ledge, near the river.St.Burr is silent on the issue.  We'll never know for sure.We do know that Hamilton fired first, very quickly, and that his ball went high and wide, smashing branches above and behind St.Burr.  Did he mis-trigger?  Serves him right, if he did.  His shot was the go for St.Burr, who aimed to kill, and killed--to paraphrase Gore Vidal's admirable 1976 novel, ""Burr"".St.Burr's stand-tall principles put him far outside the mainstream and made him an easy target.  So, of course, Hamilton's boosters--the superrich and their parasites--smeared St.Burr, the notorious assassin, with everything they could reach for a couple of decades.  Under that heavy smear is pretty much where St.Burr's reputation lays today.  (But see especially, Nancy Isenberg, ""Fallen Founder: The Life Of Aaron Burr"", 560 pages, 2007.  It's been called ""a necessary and overdue corrective"" by one reviewer--not myself.)Okay, first we'll bury the whole notion of 'sophistry'.  We'll publish definitions of it in all the dictionaries.  The new definitions will cut it down to a quaint harmlessness.  Ordinary citizens should never know which way is up.If the U.S. monied elite are good at anything, it's buying whatever they want--politicians, judges, professors, publishers, along with ""ships, and shoes, and sealing wax""--what the walruses preach to gullible oysters.Of course, the monied elites can't hide classical sophistry from students of philosophy and logic.  There's just too much information in too many literatures bearing on the 1st and 2nd Sophistics.  Those are sophistry activity periods roughly lumped around the lives and anti-sophistry writings of Aristotle and Cicero, respectively.  Both men were adamant that truth is a necessary attribute of human community.  Both expressed the human need for truth in many ways.  Both have many adherents who speak and write in many languages.  (Yes, I know.  Cicero is too slippery to put up at Aristotle's level.  But it was a 2nd Century CE sophist who named Cicero to the 2nd Sophistic, so truth deals the hand.)Additionally, there's modern-day cook-book logic.  It's course-work for college freshman, which, all by itself, shreds and blows up sophistry by the numbers.  (Do they still teach that course of truth tables, Aristotlean syllogisms, set theory, and Venn diagrams?  Measures of truth.  Freed my post-military, straight-jacketed brain and gave me wings.)Forget dictionaries for 'sophistry'.  Go straight for George Kennedy's translation of ""Aristotle: A Theory of Civic Discourse"", Oxford Univ Press, 1991.  Kennedy's translation is unique in the world of philosophy.  It's an exercise in English language clarity that requires no previous study by the reader into the rigors of philosophy or the Greek language.  Kennedy is a teacher.It's a 312-page text, but Kennedy needs only about 97 pages to teach the reader (Aristotle's) classical persuasion's ""logos"" (evidence in fact or in truthful argument), ""ethos"" (expressions of the laudable character of the principal person or persons), and ""pathos"" (creation of emotion in the observer that is favorable to the attempted persuasion and to the principal person or persons).Those elements of persuasion are the same for both classical rhetoric and classical sophistry.  However, as advertised, classical rhetoric's persuasion is based on truth and ethical intent.  Classical sophistry's persuation is based on plausible falsehoods and unethical intent.As Aristotle says, sophistry is a matter of the deliberate choice of specious arguments.  No wiggle room.  (See Kennedy, p. 36, in section 14.)Don't worry about how to handle sophistry.  There's a falsehood in there, no matter how plausible.  Pull out the lie and the whole thing unravels.  Find the lie.The mis-steps to our sophistry-laden step-off into American govt are especially germane to ""Syriana"" because the motivation was and is the grabbing of our money and the power that money provides.  We're sitting on 224 years of connected, anti-American sophistry.Grabbing money and power was Hamilton's job in the Constitutional Convention and in the ""Federalist Papers"".  Fair readings of the extant delegates' journals at the Convention--kept behind closed doors--and of the ""Federalist Papers"", show that Hamilton was up to his eyeballs in money- and power-grabbing sophistries.  Slavery?  No problem.  It's profitable for the ""Gentlemen""  Citizen rights?  What citizen rights?  Oh, you won't agree to the Constitution without them?  Magna Carta?  500 years ago?  How brazen of you, sir.  How rude and insulting, sir.  We'll fight you every inch of the way--deviously and behind your backs, of course, as is our way.  (The Bill of Rights could have been much more than what it is.)Grabbing money and power is also the ""Syriana"" screenplay's job.  It's there to persuade us that all the good greed and winning corruption performed by the fascist-corporatism of Big Oil and U.S. govt is necessary to get us what WE DEMAND in gasoline and fuel oil.  It's all OUR FAULT.  It's there to put us off just one more month, one more year, one more decade.  Let the good times roll the money on in.Hocus-pocus.  You will not remember the politician-spewed promises of alternative energy sources made since Nixon's 1971 howler.  You will not remember Clinton's snuffing, about 1996, of the Office of Fuels Development (under the National Renewable Energy Laboratory).  It was the agency that discovered that we could get 100-percent of our annual over-the-road fuel needs from algae-biodiesel grown in an American desert and burned in standard diesel engines.  No more Gulf-region dependency.Clinton used fascist-corporatism like a club to preserve Big Oil's way of life in the global oil fields and in global terrorism.  So far he's helped them to get about 16 more years of unquestioned, unprosecuted time and money.Fortunately for all of us, smart people at the Univ of New Hampshire remembered the algae-biodiesel advancements of that little, seemingly insignificant agency.Hocus-pocus.  You will only remember the confused and chop-away-editing stew of ""Syriana"" sophistry--where greed is good, corruption is why we win, and terrorists get to murder innocents across the world with weapons we supply because our oil interests in the Gulf region demand that we sell terrorists such weapons.  (How else would fascist-corporatism get US military grunts to fight and die for Big Oil profits?  I mean, now that Weapons of Mass Destruction are no longer on the table.  Remember WMDs?  No, I didn't think so.)The blatant fascist-corporatism sophistry of ""Syriana"" is a dispicable insult to my intelligence.  And that's after I've acknowledged that ""Syriana"" is just a fictional story, nothing more.  I can only hope that many others have similar sensibilities and reactions.You should sit through a few showings of ""Syriana"" to get a finger-tip feeling of what sustained sophistry looks like.  More importantly, it can show you the difficulty of finding the sophistic lies at first glance.  Against sophisticated sophistry, you have to look all the way around the front and the back, and then bring in outside counter-examples.Stay real.  Question everything.  Drive it all through shaped charges of logic and reason with critical thinking.  Pull it all through the highest levels of intellectual honesty, where belief systems are not allowed.  Remember Bertrand Bussell:  ""People would rather die than think--most do.""Other than Tim Blake Nelson's Danny Dalton and his misrepresentation of Milton Friedman's Nobel Prize--in his ""corruption is why we win"" speech--there's nothing in ""Syriana"" to really nail down as a falsehood.  It's all a fiction to start with.  The exercise in the difficulty of nailing down sophistic lies on-the-face-of-it makes watching ""Syriana"" a worthy exercise.  You have to go outside ""Syriana"" to demonstrate the sophistic lies presented inside ""Syriana"".  You have to do the same with the ""Federalist Papers"" in many of its sophistries.Of course, turning your sophistry analysis to the ""Federalist Papers"" might require that you go up a few skill-sets--given 18th Century English-language usages, intense political history, and Hamilton's skillful use of the more obscure elements in Aristotlean logic.  Still, from the springboards of the Kennedy text and cook-book logic, it's do-able.American society and its human communities need to grasp the whole run of sophistry in our national history.  It's knowledge that can prevent on-going nose-leading and pick-pocketing.  And, in the end, it's the showing off of that on-going element for which ""Syriana"" should be prized.Hey, us and them are pretty much the same since 1787.  More's the pity.--spib, 07 Jan 2012.",5,"""Syriana""--sophistry in art imitating plausibility.",1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,21692,"['SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Syriana', 'just', 'one', 'fictional', 'epic',

984877,A6R8XUE6MJLMC,B000F7CMRM,Stuart Winer,"[0, 0]","I was mesmerized watching this movie.  I've never seen a film which assumed such a high level of comprehension by its audience - so high in fact that some parts were barely understandable for long periods.  The four multi-layered intertwined plots did eventually come together in a moving crescendo and in the last moment the film felt very solid and barren and hot and dry, with its unbearable truth revealed which made the world a much uglier and less hopeful place.But there were flaws in the details which I thought made this - supposedly a realistic story - impossible.  This work has great breadth and value, but I felt I was being given a worldview which doesn't quite jibe.-Spoiler Alert-Bob is a CIA handler.  He's a trusted man with a lifetime career on the inside. I don't believe that his superiors would circle the wagons against him to shield themselves the way it's described in the movie, and if they did do so, it would be 'for show', and he'd be given a new identity with a hefty golden parachute.  Anything less would cripple the morale of the agency, as other agents would assume that they'd also be easily cut loose and destroyed.Bob would also would NEVER threaten to kill the family of his superiors. That's treason in itself.  And even if he did so he'd still have no solid reason to fly back to the Kingdom and warn the Prince of the CIA plan.  He would never know exactly where the caravan of vehicles was located as he'd be cut out of the top-secret information loop, and furthemore, preventing a missile-asassination attack would be almost impossible.  To put himself back in the game at that point was to go against the entire American establishment - it was a virtual suicide on his part.  I don't see anything to motivate this.Worse, I feel like.. If the film is about international international bribery competition by nations for strategic oil reserves, I didn't want the oil to go the the Chinese.  I got their point. Fine.  Are the filmakers so concerned with showing their ugly truth that one cannot even advocate for America's success?  Or do they have an assumption here that the Chinese would act fairly, like angels, and only the Americans are corrupting?  Actually everyone is corrupt, all the time - which leads to an even playing field.  It was the Arab leader's responsibility to choose the right son and be ethical and serve their subjects' interests, not America's.So the story describes a dark game, but a necessary one, and from that corruption there is unavoidable evil and exploitation (the Pakistanis) which we can never cure - it's beyond the scope or abilities of the US to do so.  I felt entertained and drawn in to this film, but with these and a couple similar problems, and this lack of a clearer moral framework - I'll deduct one star.  4/5.[...]",4,Flawed Masterpiece.,1134604800,"12 15, 2005",2005,2804,"['was', 'mesmerized', 'watching', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'assumed', 'high', 'level', 'comprehension', 'audience', 'so', 'high', 'fact', 'parts', 'were', 'barely', 'understandable', 'long', 'periods', 'four', 'multi-layered', 'intertwined', 'plots', 'did', 'eventually', 'come', 'together', 'moving', 'crescendo', 'last', 'moment', 'film', 'felt', 'very', 'solid', 'barren', 'hot', 'dry', 'unbearable', 'truth', 'revealed', 'made', 'world', 'much', 'uglier', 'less', 'hopeful', 'place.But', 'were', 'flaws', 'details', 'thought', 'made', 'supposedly', 'realistic', 'story', 'impossible', 'work', 'great', 'breadth', 'value', 'felt', 'was', 'being', 'given', 'worldview', ""n't"", 'quite', 'jibe.-Spoiler', 'Alert-Bob', 'CIA', 'handler', 'trusted', 'man', 'lifetime', 'career', 'inside', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'superiors', 'would', 'circle', 'wagons', 'shield', 'way', 'described', 'movie', 'did', 'do', 'so', 'would', 'be', ""'for"", 'show', ""'d"", 'be', 'given', 'new', 'identity', 'hefty', 'golden', 'parachute', 'Anything', 'less', 'would', 'cripple', 'morale', 'agency', 'other', 'agents', 'would', 'assume', ""'d"", 'also', 'be', 'easily', 'cut', 'loose', 'destroyed.Bob', 'would', 'also', 'would', 'NEVER', 'threaten', 'kill', 'family', 'superiors', 'treason', 'even', 'did', 'so', ""'d"", 'still', 'have', 'solid', 'reason', 'fly', 'back', 'Kingdom', 'warn', 'Prince', 'CIA', 'plan', 'would', 'never', 'know', 'exactly', 'where', 'caravan', 'vehicles', 'was', 'located', ""'d"", 'be', 'cut', 'top-secret', 'information', 'loop', 'furthemore', 'preventing', 'missile-asassination', 'attack', 'would', 'be', 'almost', 'impossible', 'put', 'back', 'game', 'point', 'was', 'go', 'entire', 'American', 'establishment', 'was', 'virtual', 'suicide', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'motivate', 'this.Worse', 'feel', 'like..', 'film', 'international', 'international', 'bribery', 'competition', 'nations', 'strategic', 'oil', 'reserves', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'oil', 'go', 'Chinese', 'got', 'point', 'Fine', 'Are', 'filmakers', 'so', 'concerned', 'showing', 'ugly', 'truth', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'advocate', 'America', 'success', 'do', 'have', 'assumption', 'here', 'Chinese', 'would', 'act', 'fairly', 'angels', 'only', 'Americans', 'are', 'corrupting', 'Actually', 'everyone', 'corrupt', 'time', 'even', 'playing', 'field', 'was', 'Arab', 'leader', 'responsibility', 'choose', 'right', 'son', 'be', 'ethical', 'serve', 'subjects', 'interests', 'not', ""America's.So"", 'story', 'dark', 'game', 'necessary', 'one', 'corruption', 'unavoidable', 'evil', 'exploitation', 'Pakistanis', 'can', 'never', 'cure', 'scope', 'abilities', 'US', 'do', 'so', 'felt', 'entertained', 'drawn', 'film', 'couple', 'similar', 'problems', 'lack', 'clearer', 'moral', 'framework', ""'ll"", 'deduct', 'one', 'star', '4/5.', '[', ']']",N/A

It's a densely plotted,highly-wrought work,sometimes obscure,drip-feeding you vast amounts ofinformation, in a series of short 1-1.5 minute scenes and a large cast of characters, simultantaneously,all over the world.Sometimes it's hard to glean what is being said and who is saying it and why they are saying it.I resented this obstacle to understanding, and you need to watch the film very closely.The thesis of Syriana is the system is wrong,people, governments,individuals are caught up in it.Big Business,corporations run the show.The rat race for control of Persian Gulf oil by whatever means necessary determines who dominates the world. Government is controlled by underlying forces.Only repeated viewing uncovers how 5 different narrative strands come together in this intricate tale of corruption,greed and power.The minor roles are all excellent too.George Clooney plays Bob Barnes as a fallen from grace CIA operative,overweight and bearded.He is the emotional heart and provides the momentum of the story.He is asked to stay `on message',is coming to the end of his active career and to get a desk job is being asked to go to Beirut and assassinate Prince Nasir.He is being cut loose. Jeffrey Wright plays Bennett Holiday,a lawyer investigating the merger of Connex and Killeen,'fixing' problems. This is a central role.Matt Damon plays an ambitious energy analyst,who through a personal tragedy becomes a financial consultant to Prince Nasir,assisting his revolutionary views for changes in the Arab world. Wassim(Munhir)a poor immigrant Pakistani worker,shows the Islamicisation of displaced youth,calling for the ultimate sacrifice.The Prince is involved with the Chinese and this sets off scenes of torture,murder, corruption, suicide, kidnap, betrayal.'Syriana' is the name given to an Americanised Middle East,manufacturing consent of the people and world powers to make life easier for elites.Possibly there is an element of conspiracy theories at work but the film is an eye-opener to many actualities and realities,forces at work in the world that ultimately warp and distort democracies of the free world.This is a multi-perspectival ,multiplotted film of 87-90 scenes of various characters in the west and the Middle East,whose subject is oil and Big Business's desire to get its hands on this rapidly diminishing resource,the shadey deals,the mergers of oil companies,involving torture,the CIA,murder,extremes of poverty,spies,Islamist radicalization,corruption,immigrant labourers,Emirs,Princes,industrialists,politicos.The film is shot without any flourishes, on hand-held cameras and influences the energy with which such a vast subject is tackled.It's not a total success as it takes a gathering momentum of small scenes by  of the film before you understand,but it's a significant film, which earned Clooney the best supporting actor Oscar.It contains elements of a thriller, but has no big action scenarios.The film challenges the audience to come to their own conclusions of what is going on.With climate change, issues of oil pollution and dwindling

That film wove together four story lines with four different protagonists on different sides of America's ""War on Drugs"". This film acts similarly, weaving together the lives of four men as they navigate the consequences that come about as Western interests stake their claims on the world's ever-dwindling supply of Oil in the Middle East. ""Traffic"" negotiated its complicated story (which took place in the U.S. and Mexico) by walking clear and understandable moral lines to American audiences: drugs are a terrible evil, but family and loyalty are the ultimate good, and the two poles are not necessarily mutually exclusive. ""Syriana"" is morally hazier than ""Traffic"", and plays sort of like the next class up in Big Idea screen writing - ""Traffic"" is the prerequisite, and if you could follow it no problem, you're probably smart enough for ""Syriana"".  Bob Barnes (George Clooney), a world-worn CIA agent adept at getting his hands dirty in fun locations like Tehran and Beirut, is the first of the four (for lack of a better word) protagonists. Thought to be a liability by his superiors, he's given one last assignment, to arrange the assassination of Prince Nasr (Alexander Siddig), a royal from an unnamed Arab Emirate who awarded an oil contract to the Chinese after they outbid an American company. Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst who becomes the economic adviser to Nasr following the tragic death of Woodman's son at the Prince's estate. Meanwhile, back in the U.S., Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright), an attorney for Connex Oil, investigates his superiors in order to get a merger with another company, Killen Oil, approved by the Department of Justice. And, back in the Emirate, a young Pakistani man named Wasim Khan (Mazhar Munir) loses his job at the Connex plant when the Chinese take over, and from his economic hardship becomes seduced into radical Islamic fundamentalism. All of these stories intersect each other as each of these men must make decisions to do the Right thing, or do the most Advantageous thing, in what one character calls ""a fight to the death."" Ultimately, though, the film has a dark and upsetting message: that it is in the West's business interests not to ignore the hardship and chaos in the Middle East, but to encourage it.Ensemble films often come with their own trouble: not having one single character provides the danger of painting everything with a broad brush. Gaghan twists this by providing all the characters with a moral ambiguity that is at the heart of this film's politics. The scenes between Woodman and his wife Julie (Amanda Peet), as she is horrified at how he is profiting off of the death of their son, are painful and glorious at the same time. The quiet way that Holiday is taken into one-on-one conversations and back rooms and corners by members of the Connex and Killen corporations, each trying to shape the quiet man, complicates what ultimately happens with the merger. Barnes seems to constantly be at war within himself, about whether he's weary of feeling bad for the things he's doing, or just weary of doing the only thing he knows how. The film is also helped by a theme of the disconnect between fathers and sons, reminding me that the best films about business are those in which the young go-getter seeks out another paterfamilias in a world of money when the one at home wasn't sufficient (think ""Wall Street"").  The performances are all very strong. Clooney put on 35 lbs for the film, and hiding behind the weight and the beard allows him to almost hide inside himself, a man who had to literally build a thick skin as he realized how few people could understand the world he lives in. Damon is also strong, playing a character with enough seething energy that, in the hands of another actor, might have come off like a bland everyman or an overplayed twit. Wright and Munir allow themselves a quiet, smart observation--you believe their transformations not because the people around them are charismatic (which they are), but because you can see them being filled up by the new worlds they are entering. There is also fine supporting work, possibly the best coming from Siddig as Prince Nasr, a charismatic leader and tragic hero of the film, and Chris Cooper, the head of Killen Oil, who tears around a Board of Directors meeting reminding everyone why he's the only one in the room who doesn't have to wear an uncomfortable-looking suit.The real central performance, however, is the politics, ideas, and information in the film. At times, the plot points can be a bit confusing as we discover the intricacies of what is going on. This is a good idea, however, because it forces the audience to pay attention to what is going on, allowing them to better absorb the complexities of Oil policy. This film provides an interesting template for films that want to take on complex subjects that affect the whole world. It doesn't just tell interesting stories but opens the audience up to the idea that the world doesn't work in black and white (as it often does in the movies), people do bad things in the ""Real World"", but not always for bad reasons, and people do good things, and the world can be left off in worse shape. With this moral ambiguity and the specificity of the politics and situations, ""Syriana"" is one of the smartest films to hit the big screen in years. Hollywood should be making more films like this.",5,Syriana  (2005),1150848000,"06 21, 2006",2006,5790,"['Director', 'Stephen', 'GaghanCast', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright',

984884,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000F7CMRM,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[141, 201]","""Syriana"", writer/ director Stephen Gaghan's follow-up to his Oscar winning screenplay for ""Traffic"", is an involving, complicated look at the oil industry. It is a very good film, but you are going to have to work at it, paying attention to every moment, in order to keep track of all of the characters, events and manipulation being depicted.Bob (George Clooney), an undercover agent, sells two missiles to a contact in Iran. One of the missiles is promptly taken away by an unknown second party., the other weapon explodes as the man who purchased it, drives away. Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) works for a small investment firm in Geneva, Switzerland. His firm is trying to become the advisors for the aging, ready to retire Emir and his two ambitious sons. Bryan, his wife, Julie (Amanda Peet) and their two sons are invited to the Emir's birthday party in Mallorca, Spain. After tragedy befalls his family, Bryan's company wins the coveted contract advising the Emir's oldest son. Bennett Holliday (Jeffrey Wright), a lawyer with a Washington, DC firm, is put in charge of scrutinizing the impending merger of two large oil firms, one of which is owned by Jimmy Pope (Chris Cooper), a good old Texas boy who doesn't seem to really want the merger. Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer), a high level advisor in the government, quietly pulls strings to make sure the ""right"" son becomes the new Emir.All of these characters are involved in seemingly different storylines, and they don't really interact for a significant portion of the film. As you watch a few moments with Clooney in Iran, Beirut or Baltimore or a few moments with Damon in Geneva, Mallorca or the desert, Gaghan helps us to learn a little about these characters and their involvement in a story with a huge scope, spanning many countries around the globe. Towards the end when the storylines begin to overlap, and all of the machinations begin to make sense, you get the sense that the director has prepared us well, or as well as anyone could, to understand how all of these different people, all of these different factors, are involved in the story.Gaghan, whose debut directorial effort was the rightfully ignored thriller ""Abandoned"" starring Benjamin Bratt and Katie Holmes, follows that up with this epic about the oil industry. Gaghan works very hard to keep the audience in the loop, helping them keep track of characters, the locations and the action. In many ways, it is very similar to ""Traffic""; multiple characters, multiple locations, storylines that don't necessarily overlap. Gaghan seems to have adopted the style of Steven Soderbergh, the director of ""Traffic"". There is a lot of handheld camera work, to create a sense of immediacy and closeness to all of the action. Thankfully, as Gaghan introduces the various characters, type appears on screen identifying their location, helping us stay grounded in the action, helping us keep track. If you liked ""Traffic"", you should also appreciate this new film. If not, stay away. I know that a lot of handheld camera work can drive some people batty, but in this case, it really works well in service of the story.If even half of the manipulations presented in this film are based on actual truth, it is no wonder the oil industry is so filled with corruption. The people who control this industry are wealthy beyond our comprehension and they want to make sure we stay that way and are willing to do anything, including changing the course of another country's government, covering up covert arm sales, hiding bribes, etc.As the film moves from one character to the next, one location to another across the globe, and introduces more and more people, we begin to recognize there is a common thread throughout; everyone is greedy. Some of the people don't necessarily start out that way, but they are soon corrupted. The greedier they are in the beginning, the richer they are in the end. The most interesting moments, for me, are when a couple of characters give in to their greed, and the audience realizes this for the first time. The way they give in to this temptation is quite shocking and memorable.With such a large ensemble, and each of the major stars on screen for less than thirty minutes or so, it is difficult for them to create a performance that is anything more than serviceable to the story. This isn't a bad thing, but people who are expecting George Clooney and Matt Damon to share a lot of screen time, will be disappointed. Clearly, each of the actors was interested in getting this film made and didn't want to be the ""star"". The supporting cast is more successful, simply because they have less baggage accompanying them. If you see Clooney or Damon, you expect them to carry the film. When they don't, it is a little bit of a let down. Chris Cooper, Tim Blake Nelson, Christopher Plummer and Alexander Siddig as Prince Nasir Al-Subaai, the Emir's older son, all leave a memorable impression in a very short period of time.""Syriana"" is a film that is trying to educate us through the medium of drama. It isn't a documentary, but a lot of what is depicted probably has happened or will happen. Because of this, you will probably be more informed, more skeptical the next time you hear a story about an oil company receiving exclusive drilling rights in some far off country, the next time you hear a President from Texas inform the public about the rational behind increasing oil prices or the rational behind going to war in a small country in the Middle East.""Syriana"" is a film worthy of

I wouldn't have enjoyed it any more but I would have admired it.This is one of those BIG MESSAGE movies and it's rare that they work, but this one really doesn't work. Sure the conceit that oil companies rule America and force them to kill the best and the brightest muslim leaders because they are greedy oil men is decent enough. Only, it's also a trifle too smug. According to this movie, the U.S. government only kills people that get in the way of the oil companies. Had Alexander Siddig's character been anything but Saint Emir, this might have been an interesting movie, but since the movie is all about him giving the oil companies trouble (by selling to China instead) and trying to reform Saudi Arabia (thereby proving that he's doomed along with the big eyed children that populate these SERIOUS movies) it really doesn't give him much to go on. Now if he was selling oil to China, trying to reform Saudi Arabia AND funding terrorism, he'd have been an interesting character. And the actor is likeable enough. The audience would have gone with him there. Instead we get a couple of ciphers in a worker's village to act as the terrorists. They meet the wrong cleric and he stears them to Heaven.The rest of the storylines range from interesting to deadly dull. George Clooney gets some great scenes as the CIA operative whose world is crumbling under the shifting loyalties of his bosses and co-workers. Alexander Siddig provides the moral center of the story. The terrorist kids have a nice desperation and the cleric has a swarmy religiosity mixed with chumminess that shows how they get sucked in.Sadly half the movie takes place in America and these scenes die. They range from Washington INSIDER scenes that are ridiculously West Wing inspired (except who really says ""we're not worried about a lost missile?"" especially since the operation was all abotu selling missiles to terrorists in order to blow them up) and the oil company board room meetings - and these are about as exciting as the last board room meeting you've been in. Only you had to go because it was probably your job and you weren't paying $10 to waste your time watching it.This could have been a good movie, but it's too self-important for it's own good.

It's the type of film that I would have to watch more than once to appreciate, as I didn't get a sense of who all the characters were and what agendas they had.Oil rich Gulf country's apparent next leader, a prince, decides to award a Chinese company the rights to drill natural gas, rights held by a big US company, who were outbid. The US company now tries to merge with a smaller US company who has won drilling rights in Kazakhstan, one of the largest untapped oil reserves in the world. The smaller company is such an unlikely candidate that the authorities begin to investigate what dirty deals took place. A DC law firm is hired to investigate the desired merger, to see if any laws were broken by either company by payoffs, etc. The Emir of the country is old, wants to retire and he has two possible successors in his sons. One is older, socially progressive, with a Ph.D and shady connections to enemies of the US through arms deals, while the other is a young twentysomething, more open to cooperating with the US and open to not be overshadowed by his older brother. A young oil worker is laid off, joins a madrass, comes under the influence of his radical teacher and has the makings of a bad guy...Strong performances by the supporting cast, but George Clooney and Matt Damon's characters are not very dynamic or particularly interesting. Unfortunately, the film fails to develop and weave the subplots together in a succinct fashion.

984891,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000F7CMRM,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 5]","""Complicated"" and ""Talky"" are the words you are most likely to hear about `Syriana.' And don't forget this, `Political.' Right, the film is all of them, but probably the most impressive part of it is that though it is very confusing with the fragmentary stories and lots of characters, the film is not boring. The results are surely admirable, especially as political thriller, in spite of some unanswered questions and the loose ends in the story, and the film's dubious (but provocative) answers to the volatile political relations between US and the Middle East that is ironically implied in the word Syriana.There are several threads of the stories going on simultaneously, and none of them explain much about the situation or backgrounds of the characters. There is a veteran CIA agent whose assignment is to assassinate the Prince of one fictional Emir. In this idealistic Prince, one American energy analyst finds future of the country. In the meanwhile, two oil companies confirm a merger agreement. And there are the unemployed young males and the Muslin extremists.Watch carefully, and you know the film's method works, if not perfectly. Each story is told bit by bit, one small episode or chatting after another, with very skillful editing and atmospheric photography, leading up to the conclusion, which is not a big secret. Those `bits' of the story which in themselves are not particularly original are still greatly helped by the first-rate cast and their effective performances. Though only George Clooney is mentioned in the Oscar race, his acting is just one of the excellent works of other talented actors.Some say `Syriana' is an eye opener. Maybe so. But those who are already interested in the Middle East and the politics there will find the film's content sound like twice-told tales. And the film's use of torture, missile, car bomb, or whatever those characters are doing in the film can also be found in Tom Clancy novels. `Syriana' is an intriguing version of powerfully-told conspiracy theory, but the conspiracy itself is no news at all.",3,Well-Acted and Intriguing Political Thriller with Too Complicated Script,1141862400,"03 9, 2006",2006,2067,"['Complicated', 'Talky', 'are', 'words', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'hear', 'Syriana', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Political', 'Right', 'film', 'probably', 'most', 'impressive', 'part', 'very', 'confusing', 'fragmentary', 'stories', 'lots', 'characters', 'film', 'not', 'boring', 'results', 'are', 'surely', 'admirable', 'especially', 'political', 'thriller', 'spite', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'loose', 'ends', 'story', 'film', 'dubious', 'provocative', 'answers', 'volatile', 'political', 'relations', 'US', 'Middle', 'East', 'ironically', 'implied', 'word', 'Syriana.There', 'are', 'several', 'threads', 'stories', 'going', 'simultaneously', 'none', 'explain', 'much', 'situation', 'backgrounds', 'characters', 'veteran', 'CIA', 'agent', 'assignment', 'assassinate', 'Prince', 'one', 'fictional', 'Emir', 'idealistic', 'Prince', 'one', 'American', 'energy', 'analyst', 'future', 'country', 'meanwhile', 'two', 'oil', 'companies', 'confirm', 'merger', 'agreement', 'are', 'unemployed', 'young', 'males', 'Muslin', 'extremists.Watch', 'carefully', 'know', 'film', 'method', 'not', 'perfectly', 'story', 'told', 'bit', 'bit', 'one', 'small', 'episode', 'chatting', 'very', 'skillful', 'editing', 'atmospheric', 'photography', 'leading', 'up', 'conclusion', 'not', 'big', 'secret', 'bits', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'original', 'are', 'still', 'greatly', 'helped', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'effective', 'performances', 'only', 'George', 'Clooney', 'mentioned', 'Oscar', 'race', 'acting', 'just', 'one', 'excellent', 'works', 'other', 'talented', 'actors.Some', 'say', 'Syriana', 'eye', 'opener', 'Maybe', 'so', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'interested', 'Middle', 'East', 'politics', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'content', 'sound', 'twice-told', 'tales', 'film', 'use', 'torture', 'missile', 'car', 'bomb', 'characters', 'are', 'doing', 'film', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'found', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'novels', 'Syriana', 'intriguing', 'version', 'powerfully-told', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'conspiracy', 'news']",N/A

The plot itself is rather complicated, and can lose its audience easily, but makes a strong case about the US wanting to continue the chaos in the Middle East for oil. There are so many layers and intricacies weaved into the movie that by the end of the movie, the viewer is left with the feeling that they just witnessed something great, perhaps greater than they are able to comprehend.Unlike Crash, a movie that also intertwines many stories together to make a point, the stories in Syriana add to depth. Syriana takes you from the US government, to the Saudi emirs, to the middleman, to the businessman, and most astoundingly, to suicide bombers. Syriana tries to explain how young men can be drawn by the charisma and allure of suicide bomber recruiters. There is no pity, but rather an understanding.This film is proof as to why George Clooney rightfully deserves his newly found Hollywood ""wonder boy"" status. He produces and stars in it, and he expertly portrays his character while speaking various Middle Eastern languages. Matt Damon also gives an excellent performance.

984897,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,B000F7CMRM,Wanda B. Red,"[5, 5]","A stylish, sophisticated, complex film. Really almost too complex. Ultimately director Stephan Gaghan is able to tie all the threads together, but that doesn't make the film comprehensible as it's being viewed. Too many unknown thugs run in and out of warehouses and hotel rooms; too many oil rigs and fields migrate on and off the screen; too many random and unidentified telephones ring; who is answering them? Where are they? What does it all mean? To grasp this movie fully, I would have to watch it again, and I don't want to.Even so, a pudged-up but nonetheless charismatic and intense George Clooney does a great job, as do most all the actors, and it's a distinguished cast -- Matt Damon, Chris Cooper, Amanda Peet, Jeffrey Wright. Fast-paced and accompanied by a subtle, percussion-heavy score by Alexandre Desplat, the film is easy to watch and exciting as long as you're willing to tolerate some confusion and ambiguity . . . and as long as you don't mind the very heavy-handed anti-American message.On that topic, it's unclear to me how much truth there is in this movie. It's based on a book (and it seems the author collaborated with the film-makers) called ""See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism,"" but the country at the center of the film, ""Syriana,"" is a fictional composite. Also, the message just comes out too neatly that capitalism is hypocritical and that the American democracy has entirely been hijacked by corrupt forces that care only about getting oil and making money. Maybe that's true, but the details here are quite hard to credit. For example, I find it really hard to fathom that the private lawyer Dean Whiting (a symbolic name if I've ever heard one!), played by Christopher Plummer, could really wield such control over the inner reaches of the CIA.

984898,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000F7CMRM,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[3, 5]","""Syriana"" allows writer/director to create a rich quartet of stories built around the need, desire and acquision of oil. A complex political drama Stephen Gaghan examines the complex wheeling and dealing in the world of oil and how it effects both the personal and political. ""Syriana"" isn't for everyone; some people will find this interwoven tale to be boring. If you enjoyed ""Traffic"" you'll enjoy ""Syriana"". Also, if you're not in tune with the film's politics you probably won't find it fair balanced or enjoy the film quite as much. Regardless of the politics its clear that Gaghan has tried to make a film that deals with a complex subject that isn't easily rectified.George Clooney (who won an Oscar for his role) plays Bob Barnes a CIA operative working undercover as an arms smuggler in the Middle East trying to uncover plots against our government, taking out the bad guys all without drawing too much suspicion to himself. Barnes is conflicted and literally coming apart at the seams much like a John Le Carre character--he's not the spy who came out of the cold but one that has been locked out and invited in only long enough to prevent emotional frostbite from destroying his mind. He's coasting though as he's jaded and burned out. Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) represents a potential Emir (Alexander Siddig, ""Deep Space Nine"" and ""The Kingdom of Heaven"") who is jostling for political power within his kingdom and trying to cut the right deal for oil rights that might save his land and enrich his family at the same time. Corporate lawyer Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) represents the interests of an oil company trying to navigate the shark infested waters of a merger while dealing with his drug addled brother. There's a forth part of the story that ties into Clooney's involving Muslim youths training to be terrorists but it isn't given as much screen time as the other trio of stories and as such can be seen as part of Clooney's as his fate is ultimately and tragically tied into that of the terrorists.This DVD looks marvelous. The washed out look of the film is intentional. Cinemattographer Robert Elswit uses his jumpy handheld camera work to sell the quasi-documentary feel of the film. The colors are solid as are the blacks and fit into the color scheme of the film. I didn't detect any digital blemishes that are worthwhile noting. Contrast is terrific whether it be in the blinding white desert or the dark streets of Washington D.C. and detail is crisp throughout the film. Gaghan doesn't overwhelm the audience with activity in the 5.1 soundtrack reserving the format for dramatic effect such as an unexpected bomb blast or torture scene (and there is a quite graphic one involving Clooney).The extras are a bit of a let down unless you get the Best Buy edition of the film. We don't get a commentary track (perhaps Gaghan felt it would be explaining too much) but we do get a 10 minute interview with George Clooney, three deleted scenes playable together, a political charge featurette ""Make A Change, Make A Difference"" that sells the political agenda of the film far more explicitly than the film itself  and a theatrical trailer.I have the feeling that a double dip will be down the line only because retailer Best Buy is offering a second exclusive disc with content that includes a discussion with a real CIA operative discussing the film. To be fair to Warner usually this studio isn't well known for doing double dips as often or thoughtlessly as other studios so don't know any of this for a fact. Usually these bonus discs end up as part of material for later more elaborate sets. I can't confirm this at this film but it feels right particularly after Lion's Gate's ""Crash"" re-release. The ""Best Buy"" extra disc has a 30 minute documentary with the writer/director discussing the making of the film and how he researched it as well as how he worked with the author of the book to do his research by visting the places and people that he portrayed. There's also a 20 minute interview with Matt Damon included as well.This is a dense, elaborate political thriller ""Syriana"" doesn't exactly paint stereotypical pictures of bad guys and good guys. Instead we have a world of grays where oil and the pursuit of political power are more the villains (along with the things that people are willing to do to achieve their ends). Tense and filled with marvelous performances ""Syriana"" isn't for everyone but it's still a powerful drama filled with the dark political overtones of our time. ""Syriana"" packs quite a lot of story into its 128 minute running time. You'll either walk away unsettled, feeling vindicated given the current state of our own oil crisis or mad at the political point-of-view of the film. You won't coming away feeling indifferent. Perplexed at the multiple storylines that seem to randomly zigzag without a possible intersection point but definitely impressed with some element of the film whether it be the technical aspect or the drama.",4,"Politics and oil are the new religion in ""Syriana""",1150848000,"06 21, 2006",2006,5001,"['Syriana', 'writer/director', 'create', 'rich', 'quartet', 'stories', 'built', 'need', 'desire',

I suppose a great deal of the fault lies with me as a lazy viewer. I'm just not into the whole Corporate Intrigue aspect of the movie. To be sure, there are many other important strands in the weave of the Oil Web presented by the script - but the finagling and politicking involved with the oil deal that is the crux of the film was just dull. Which of course is part of the ""message"" of the movie - most oil consumers (Americans in particular) are uninterested in where the oil comes from - just as long as it is affordable and available.I suppose my disappointment stems more from watching the movie with the preconceived notion that it would be more unto a Ludlam versus Clancy type novel.The movie was NOT a waste of time - it just failed to live up to the hype.",3,Nope - Not Traffic Goes to The Middle East,1163462400,"11 14, 2006",2006,1060,"['movie', 'great', 'breeding', 'Great', 'cast', 'fine', 'performances', 'esp', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'George', 'Clooney', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Great', 'writer/director', 'Stephen', 'Gaghan', 'fresh', 'superb', 'Traffic.But', 'variety', 'reasons', 'movie', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'rise', 'same', 'level', 'Traffic', 'suppose', 'great', 'deal', 'fault', 'lazy', 'viewer', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'whole', 'Corporate', 'Intrigue', 'aspect', 'movie', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'important', 'strands', 'weave', 'Oil', 'Web', 'presented', 'script', 'finagling', 'politicking', 'involved', 'oil', 'deal', 'crux', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'dull', 'Which', 'course', 'part', 'message', 'movie', 'most', 'oil', 'consumers', 'Americans', 'particular', 'are', 'uninterested', 'where', 'oil', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'affordable', 'available.I', 'suppose', 'disappointment', 'more', 'watching', 'movie', 'preconceived', 'notion', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'Ludlam', 'versus', 'Clancy', 'novel.The', 'movie', 'was', 'NOT', 'waste', 'time', 'just', 'failed', 'live', 'up', 'hype']",N/A

Do you only watch films for big noises and improbable story lines? Do you go because you want to see good cinematography, with a genuine message? Or are you in the middle, and sometimes like either, depending on mood?If you're the latter, give it a try when you're in a thoughtful mood, if you're the first of that list, probably not for you, if you're the second this is probably ideal (I myself don't mind admitting that I am the last of that list).This is a truly thought-provoking, genuinly disturbing, and all too possible a series of situations, I would rate it as possibly the best film I will ever see.Now, it has been accused of American-bashing by some americans (I have not seen a review outside of the US that has voiced this opinion) - but I believe it is unfounded. It is scathing to the global oil industry (and quite a few of these happen to be US owned) and to the US Governments attitude towards them in it's foreign policy, but this does not mean it's saying 'all americans are hateful'.Give it a try, you may be pleasantly surprised.",5,You'll Either Love It Or Hate It.
