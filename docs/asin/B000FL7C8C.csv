Maybe had it been allowed to run its entire planned six-season arc it might've matured into a truly great series, but as it was, I found myself  let down as time and time again what I long predicted beforehand came to pass on the screen. Where were the plot twists, where was the epic scale, where were the memorable moments? I probably expected too much because I'd heard so much praise about it (yes, Rob, once again I mean you) but rather than experiencing a shiver-inducing work of darkness, I found instead a mildly disturbing Depression-era Gothic that was more about mundane grossouts than genuine supernatural eeriness.

992361,A3JWR2O1MZ7VNE,B000FL7C8C,Elizabeth Renee Blue,"[4, 4]","I only heard of it recently, so I bought the 2 seasons. I read the raving, glowing reviews beforehand, so after the first couple of discs, I was wondering if I'd been had. Everything has its fans, I thought. Twin Peaks it ain't! But around the latter second half of the first season, I got hooked. There are many characters and mysteries so it doesn't start picking up momentum initially. We switch back and forth between the Carnivale and the Preacher, not really understanding clearly the link. Plus, it takes a while for the preacher thing to start cooking and ditto with the Ben Hawkins storyline. But around the time that Brother Justin goes ""missing"" and Jonesy hooks up with Rita Sue, it starts cooking. By the time the Ben, Management, and Lodz storyline involving Ruthie kicks in I am just hooked to the story. I breezed right through the rest, all the way to the end.I am angry at the creators. The reason why HBO didn't release a 3 hour movie to wrap it up with was supposedly because the writer had too much story. Excuse me?! What kinda lazy, bollocks is that?! Editing is part of the job description! At least we got most of the major storylines wrapped up in Twin Peaks. Here nothing wrapped. It got even more unwrapped. But despite this, its worth watching anyway. I love some of the characters, which is a great compliment to any story. Jonesy was one of my absolute favorites (I was mortified in that horrifying scene- you know which one if you saw it) and why, oh why, did we end like we did with him? Nooooooo!!!!! Samson was awesome. I was so happy to see him again after TP. Brother Justin was just riveting and Iris was equally fasinating with her complex relationship with her brother. I did not care for the actress playing Sophie. I would have cast someone else. But she looks as odd as her character is, so it works anyway.I highly recommend viewing this and if you are like me, don't worry about the initial lag. Have faith. It will suddenly switch into gear and then you won't want it to ever end. An extra little shout out to the graphics when they showed the apocalyptic tree scenes. The foreshadowing scene in the cornfield was also riveting. Great artistic direction there.",5,Awesome Series!

992362,A3JXBZ8F65100O,B000FL7C8C,Ferdy,"[1, 1]","This HBO series was extremely well written and well made with a wonderful cast and perfect sets.  The only bad thing to say, really, is that it ends much too soon.  The classic good vs. evil story begins with a boy burying his dead mother in the barren waste of the dust bowl as his home is flattened by a bulldozer.  As it happens (or is it destined?) there is a traveling Carnivale passing by who offer to take the boy along with them to the next town they play.  The Carnivale is run by a little man (you may remember him from Twin peaks) and a shadowy ""manager"" who is never seen until into the second season.  The Carnivale's cast of characters include a bearded lady, a snake charmer, a strong man, a blind psychic, a Tarot card reader with a comatose, telepathic mother and more.  Each person has secrets that will unfold as the series progresses.  Their stories are juxtaposed by the story of a small town preacher and his sister who are the embodiment of ""wolves in sheep's clothing"".  The two stories run parallel at first and then begin to curve towards each other and finally intertwine.  Each new twist in the story pulls you deeper into the lives of the cast of characters.  You can never anticipate what will happen next.  It is always surprising and intriguing.  There is, in the final episode of season 2, a bit of an ending but it leaves so much still unresolved.  The series was cancelled by HBO before the writers could satisfactorily tie up all the loose ends.  I would love to see a movie or even a book that would complete the story.  Is it worth watching then, you may ask, if only to be left hanging at the end?  I would definitly recommend it.  This is a rare and wonderful television series and if enough people continue to rave about it and want more of it, maybe a movie would be considered.",4,Depression Era Gothic,1242000000,"05 11, 2009",2009,1820,"['HBO', 'series', 'was', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'made', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'perfect', 'sets', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'say', 'really', 'much', 'too', 'soon', 'classic', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'story', 'boy', 'burying', 'dead', 'mother', 'barren', 'waste', 'dust', 'bowl', 'home', 'flattened', 'bulldozer', 'destined', 'traveling', 'Carnivale', 'passing', 'who', 'offer', 'take', 'boy', 'next', 'town', 'play', 'Carnivale', 'run', 'little', 'man', 'may', 'remember', 'Twin', 'peaks', 'shadowy', 'manager', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'second', 'season', 'Carnivale', 'cast', 'characters', 'include', 'bearded', 'lady', 'snake', 'charmer', 'strong', 'man', 'blind', 'psychic', 'Tarot', 'card', 'reader', 'comatose', 'telepathic', 'mother', 'more', 'person', 'secrets', 'will', 'unfold', 'series', 'stories', 'are', 'juxtaposed', 'story', 'small', 'town', 'preacher', 'sister', 'who', 'are', 'embodiment', 'wolves', 'sheep', 'clothing', 'two', 'stories', 'run', 'parallel', 'first', 'then', 'begin', 'curve', 'towards', 'other', 'finally', 'intertwine', 'new', 'twist', 'story', 'deeper', 'lives', 'cast', 'characters', 'can', 'never', 'anticipate', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'always', 'surprising', 'intriguing', 'final', 'episode', 'season', '2', 'bit', 'ending', 'so', 'much', 'still', 'unresolved', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', 'HBO', 'writers', 'could', 'satisfactorily', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'movie', 'even', 'book', 'would', 'complete', 'story', 'worth', 'watching', 'then', 'may', 'ask', 'only', 'be', 'left', 'hanging', 'end', 'would', 'definitly', 'recommend', 'rare', 'wonderful', 'television', 'series', 'enough', 'people', 'continue', 'rave', 'want', 'more', 'maybe', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'considered']",Carnivale: The Complete First Two Seasons

992364,A19BWRT516SX6L,B000FL7C8C,"H. L. Mason ""relyonme""","[2, 7]","I was drawn to this series by the numerous glowing reviews and the mystery that it seemed to behold.  However, appearances can be deceiving, and this series certainly had me fooled.The pilot is full of portent, and seems to announce a truly remarkable adventure into the mystical struggle between the here-and-now and the forever after.  Don't be fooled.  This is Hollywood, where hokum rules.  Instead of an adventurous leap into the turbulent world of good versus evil, were are treated throughout the whole of the first season, and much of the second, to an infuriating series of episodes where virtually nothing happens and everything is repeated ad nauseum.  This series contains some of the laziest scriptwriting I have ever encountered.  I lost count of the number of dream sequences where the subject wakes up to find (for the umpteenth time) that what we have just seen was nothing more than a nightmare. You can just see it coming - like so may other highly repetitious scenes and endless flashbacks dotted throughout the 24 episodes.This is an extremely imaginative concept and beautifully produced - but the whole thing, unfortunately, fails to live up to its initial promise, and in fact rapidly degenerates into what the carnival itself is: flim-flam.  I am still left wondering why the creator of this singular series was happy to let it meander aimlessly along, going precisely nowhere, for so many long episodes. What is the point of a good idea if you don't develop it? Apart from the atmosphere, which is beautifully captured, the story line is so weak as to be virtually insulting.

992367,AOXOQBSY44N9Q,B000FL7C8C,M. Harris,"[0, 0]","At the time Carnivale ran on HBO, I didn't have cable and so rented the entire first season, then season two.  It took about seven episodes for me to get hooked--friends kept saying how wonderful it was--but it didn't click for me until we began to uncover Justin's history, the origins of his conflict and the suppression of his baser instincts.  What kept me going until that point was the absolute beauty of it.  Carnivale is a feast for the eyes: the California desert used for all dust bowl and southwest locales, the sets, costumes, props, colorized cinematography (color was deepened in post production.)--all of it.  Jeff Beal's score enhances mood, clarifies character, and is strong enough to stand on its own.We follow the story of Ben Hawkins and Justin Crowe, whose lives are connected by fate and a common destiny.  Ben's painful journey is riveting; full of incident, mystery and synchronicity, the culmination of which builds toward a shattering climax in season two.  Revelation comes thoroughly and deliberately.  Though perhaps not quickly enough for some, it is satisfying for those who appreciate process: character development, specificity in storytelling and a universality that encapsulates man's internal and external struggles against a backdrop of the mythology of good vs. evil.  The result is a rich, transcendent tale that touched me emotionally, intellectually and spiritually.I'm sorry the show was cancelled after two seasons.  I would like to have seen what the writers had outlined for the remaining three or four seasons come to fruition--the wound inflicted upon Ben by Justin that not even Ben can heal; Sophie raising Ben's and her and child in the same house with Iris; the power struggle between Iris and Sophie; Justin being ""brought back"" by Sophie as she begins to understand her own power; Justin's diminution as a force of evil as the darkness in Sophie takes hold, etc.  Ah, well!  As it is, however, you can take the end of season two as an ending for the series, as some major plotlines that were meant to plateau can stand firm as the end of the story.  It's a wonderful, unforgettable tale.I own both seasons and watch them periodically.

(I didn't start watching OZ until it had been on for years and then watched 3 seasons in one week.)The most strikingly thing about CARNIVALE is how the cast is a pitch-perfect mix of character actors, unknowns and modestly famous celebs. Anytime you see Clancy Brown AND Amy Madigan AND Patrick Bauchau in the same cast credits, you know it will be good! Cynthia Ettinger is flawless as the world-weary stripper/prostitute who falls painfully in love with Tim McKay's heroic Jonesy. Nick Stahl and Clea DuVall are both outstanding as young characters already damaged by Depression-era lives and relentless bad luck. Michael J. Anderson deftly plays the leader of the troupe as he walks a tightrope between deception and power.Show creator Daniel Knauf apparently struggled for years to make it as a teleplay writer and then when the first season of CARNIVALE was completed had to struggle again to convince HBO to make the second season. Knauf currently writes for SPARTACUS BLOOD & SAND.BATTLESTAR GALACTICA creator Ronald D.

It's unwieldy when folded out. They managed to put 3 and sometimes 4 episodes of Six Feet Under onto one disc, along with some commentaries; could they not have done this with Carnivale, making it an easily managed 4 discs per season package?The one I received had a dinged, smushed corner, and the dinged package contained a loose disc because part of the plastic disc-holding hub had broken off. This happens with way too many box sets I buy. I would rather have DVD holders made from resilient, functional plastic instead of the clear yet brittle, easy-to-break stuff. It just doesn't hold or release DVDs well, and I honestly don't care about the art behind the discs when I'm trying to pry one off its hub.Perhaps when I go dig into this richly mysterious story again, I'll be in a less gripey mood. Except of course I'll eventually have to re-confront HBO's colossally dingbat decision to cancel this series. It was exquisite torture watching this week by week; it kept me baffled for the longest time, yet I kept watching.

992374,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000FL7C8C,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[66, 69]","Easily as eliptic, complex and mysterious as ""Twin Peaks"" with more magic in its soul ""Carnivale"" only lasted two seasons on HBO because the witless suits didn't have the imagination to see the value the series added to their schedule. Keep in mind these are the same folks that also cancelled their second most watched series ""Deadwood"" after having already renewed if for a third.Set during the 1934 dustbowl we first meet the ragtag members of the Carnivale as they pass through Oklahoma. Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl) mother has just died. His home is about to be bulldozed and the dust storms that struck the midwest rage incessantly. Jonesy (Tim DeKay)the head roustabout stands up to those about to destroy Hawkins home and helps him bury his mom as do the other members of the carnival. Suddenly their family whether Hawkins likes it or not.It seems Hawkins has the ability to heal others and perform miracles. He's a lost soul in denial of his abilities and focused on discovering who he is. Across the U.S. in California Preacher Brother Justin Crowe (Clancy Brown ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and Mr. Crabs in ""Spongebobsquarepants"")discovers he has a similar gift but through circumstances beyond his control this fire and brimstone preacher who wants to do good loses his faith in God and finds himself on a very different path from the uncommunicative, uncertain Hawkins. The two men are linked both by their abilities and a series of dreams. ""Carnivale"" gives us their stories as they discover whether they are good or evil and find a place in the world for who they are as well as who they become.Featuring an excellent cast (Michael J. Anderson from ""Twin Peaks"" as Samson, Clea DuVall, Patrick Bauchau of ""The Pretender"", Adrienne Barbeau, Amy Madigan, Ralph Waite and others)the thoughtful well written stories always manage to examine the darkness and light in each of these characters as they face their struggle tod discover to exist in a harsh world.The show was designed as a six year experience. Unfortuantely HBO cancelled it after two. Although the ratings fell during the first set they began to pick up again during the end of the second season. The network elected to cancel the show and cut their losses. It's a pity as this was one of the most ambitious fantasy shows on TV and had a great storyline that I would have loved to see resolved. Hopefully one day creator David Knauf will have that opportunity in a movie.The boxed set has some terrific extras for both seasons with commentary tracks, production featurettes and all of it is nicely packaged. It's a pity that HBO didn't give this show the same opportunity as ""Deadwood"" with a series of TV movies to close out the show. I've lost faith in the network's ability to recognize great programming and they've become just as bad as the other networks (if not worse because you're paying for it so you don't have to put up with the ads).This twofer is definitely worth getting making the show much more affordable.",4,"""To each generation...born a creature of light and a creature of darkness""..",1157241600,"09 3, 2006",2006,2994,"['Easily', 'eliptic', 'complex', 'mysterious', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'more', 'magic', 'soul', 'Carnivale', 'only', 'lasted', 'two', 'seasons', 'HBO', 'witless', 'suits', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'imagination', 'see', 'value', 'series', 'added', 'schedule', 'Keep', 'mind', 'are', 'same', 'folks', 'also', 'cancelled', 'second', 'most', 'watched', 'series', 'Deadwood', 'having', 'already', 'renewed', 'third.Set', '1934', 'dustbowl', 'first', 'meet', 'ragtag', 'members', 'Carnivale', 'pass', 'Oklahoma', 'Ben', 'Hawkins', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'mother', 'just', 'died', 'home', 'be', 'bulldozed', 'dust', 'storms', 'struck', 'midwest', 'rage', 'incessantly', 'Jonesy', 'Tim', 'DeKay', 'head', 'roustabout', 'up', 'destroy', 'Hawkins', 'home', 'bury', 'mom', 'do', 'other', 'members', 'carnival', 'Suddenly', 'family', 'Hawkins', 'not.It', 'Hawkins', 'ability', 'heal', 'others', 'perform', 'miracles', 'lost', 'soul', 'denial', 'abilities', 'focused', 'discovering', 'who', 'U.S.', 'California', 'Preacher', 'Brother', 'Justin', 'Crowe', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Mr.', 'Crabs', 'Spongebobsquarepants', 'similar', 'gift', 'circumstances', 'control', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'preacher', 'who', 'do', 'good', 'loses', 'faith', 'God', 'very', 'different', 'path', 'uncommunicative', 'uncertain', 'Hawkins', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'linked', 'abilities', 'series', 'dreams', 'Carnivale', 'stories', 'discover', 'are', 'good', 'evil', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'who', 'are', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'become.Featuring', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Michael', 'J.', 'Anderson', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Samson', 'Clea', 'DuVall', 'Patrick', 'Bauchau', 'Pretender', 'Adrienne', 'Barbeau', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'Ralph', 'Waite', 'others', 'thoughtful', 'well', 'written', 'stories', 'always', 'manage', 'examine', 'darkness', 'light', 'characters', 'face', 'struggle', 'tod', 'discover', 'exist', 'harsh', 'world.The', 'show', 'was', 'designed', 'six', 'year', 'experience', 'Unfortuantely', 'HBO', 'cancelled', 'two', 'ratings', 'fell', 'first', 'set', 'began', 'pick', 'up', 'again', 'end', 'second', 'season', 'network', 'elected', 'cancel', 'show', 'cut', 'losses', 'pity', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'ambitious', 'fantasy', 'shows', 'TV', 'had', 'great', 'storyline', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'resolved', 'Hopefully', 'one', 'day', 'creator', 'David', 'Knauf', 'will', 'have', 'opportunity', 'movie.The', 'boxed', 'set', 'terrific', 'extras', 'seasons', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'production', 'featurettes', 'nicely', 'packaged', 'pity', 'HBO', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'show', 'same', 'opportunity', 'Deadwood', 'series', 'TV', 'movies', 'close', 'out', 'show', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'faith', 'network', 'ability', 'recognize', 'great', 'programming', ""'ve"", 'become', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'other', 'networks', 'not', 'worse', ""'re"", 'paying', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'put', 'up', 'ads', '.This', 'twofer', 'definitely', 'worth', 'getting', 'making', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'affordable']",Carnivale: The Complete First Two Seasons
