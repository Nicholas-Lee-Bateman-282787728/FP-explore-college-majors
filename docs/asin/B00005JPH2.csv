Lewis allegorical fantasy series, and those who have not, but lovedThe Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Full Screen Edition).To be brief, our inquisitive British children return to `Narnia' caught in a time warp that finds it in ruins and its remaining citizens dispirited and scattered.  Their enemies, the Telmarines,' have a new heir born to the throne while Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) flees for his life.  Treachery is doled out in `Hamlet' proportions, as Prince Caspian must choose sides and the children try to rebuild 'Narnia'.Compared to 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,'  'Prince Caspian' has its ups and downs:1. Action scenes are up, but the charm factor is down.  (Charm is diminished for a more harrowing adventure.)2. The Pevensies (same actors) have grown older.  In cinematic years about two and a half years; by centuries in `Narnia` years.  The audience is older, too, and that's what they were probably aimin' for.3.  Both villains deliver a real menace.  Tilda Swinton reprises her role (albeit very briefly) while seasoned actor Sergio Castellitto plays the formidable bad guy, King Miraz, head of the Telamarines.4. Talking beavers are traded for talking badgers.  Wiley wolves are exchanged for ferocious bears.5. Mr. Tumnus is replaced by Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage) and, besides Sergio, the best new stars are the swashbuckling mice with swords.The combat scenes are formidable.  They can't be dismissed as merely `Lord of the Ring' leftovers (although there's some correlation.)  Some will find it all too familiar, but it remains true to the book with a tension the first movie sometimes lacked, but none of the enhanced blur when Peter merely raised his sword as his army goes past.  (Undoubtedly, some will take the chicken or the hen approach, but, in all fairness, if you've seen it all before digitally, you may complain of excessive repetition despite the copyright dates of both Tolkien's and Lewis's works.)Either way most will agree it's hard to get tired of New Zealand.  If that's not a real life `Narnia,' then nothing is.Overall, `Prince Caspian' is an exciting, yet imperfect recreation in the `Narnia' series.  While director/ and screenplay co-author, Adam Adamson, has honed the adventure's timing admirably, the letdown happens only with what has been left behind.",4,"""Things Never Happen the Same Way Twice"" [Even in Movies]",1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,2451,"['are', 'probably', 'two', 'camps', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'interested', 'Narnia', 'sequel', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'allegorical', 'fantasy', 'series', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'lovedThe', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', '.To', 'be', 'brief', 'inquisitive', 'British', 'children', 'return', 'Narnia', 'caught', 'time', 'warp', 'ruins', 'remaining', 'citizens', 'dispirited', 'scattered', 'enemies', 'Telmarines', 'have', 'new', 'heir', 'born', 'throne', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'Ben', 'Barnes', 'life', 'Treachery', 'doled', 'out', 'Hamlet', 'proportions', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'must', 'choose', 'sides', 'children', 'try', 'rebuild', ""'Narnia'.Compared"", ""'The"", 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'Caspian', 'ups', 'downs:1', 'Action', 'scenes', 'are', 'up', 'charm', 'factor', 'down', 'Charm', 'diminished', 'more', 'harrowing', 'adventure.', '2', 'Pevensies', 'same', 'actors', 'have', 'grown', 'older', 'cinematic', 'years', 'two', 'half', 'years', 'centuries', 'Narnia', 'years', 'audience', 'older', 'too', 'what', 'were', 'probably', 'aimin', 'for.3', 'villains', 'deliver', 'real', 'menace', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'role', 'albeit', 'very', 'briefly', 'seasoned', 'actor', 'Sergio', 'Castellitto', 'formidable', 'bad', 'guy', 'King', 'Miraz', 'head', 'Telamarines.4', 'Talking', 'beavers', 'are', 'traded', 'talking', 'badgers', 'Wiley', 'wolves', 'are', 'exchanged', 'ferocious', 'bears.5', 'Mr.', 'Tumnus', 'replaced', 'Trumpkin', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'Sergio', 'best', 'new', 'stars', 'are', 'swashbuckling', 'mice', 'swords.The', 'combat', 'scenes', 'are', 'formidable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'dismissed', 'merely', 'Lord', 'Ring', 'leftovers', 'correlation', 'will', 'find', 'too', 'familiar', 'true', 'book', 'tension', 'first', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'lacked', 'none', 'enhanced', 'blur', 'when', 'Peter', 'merely', 'raised', 'sword', 'army', 'past', 'Undoubtedly', 'will', 'take', 'chicken', 'hen', 'approach', 'fairness', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'digitally', 'may', 'complain', 'excessive', 'repetition', 'copyright', 'dates', 'Tolkien', 'Lewis', 'works', 'way', 'most', 'will', 'agree', 'hard', 'get', 'tired', 'New', 'Zealand', 'not', 'real', 'life', 'Narnia', 'then', 'nothing', 'is.Overall', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'exciting', 'yet', 'imperfect', 'recreation', 'Narnia', 'series', 'director/', 'screenplay', 'co-author', 'Adam', 'Adamson', 'honed', 'adventure', 'timing', 'admirably', 'letdown', 'only', 'what', 'been', 'left']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

Not a lot by any means, and not enough to probably give it a second thought, but certain things gave this movie a more mature feel to it. The movie itself starts off slow, and slowly progresses, but once the first major fight scene comes up it barely falls off much.The Lion returns in this effort which by the time half of the movie was over, I was surprised to see, and the Witch from the first one also makes a small return.If you are worried if this is going to be too violent for a kid, I'd say overall it's not. The 1-3 year olds won't sit and watch it that much and the older ones, say 8 and up will find it engulfing and magical as I did. Sure, there is a done-that-been-there feel to it since the movie's first incarnation but Narnia: Prince Caspian is sure to please loyal fans and new fans alike.The ones I'd worry about watching it is probably the more impressionable 4-6 year olds.

After a fortuitous rescue of the dwarf Trumpkin, they eventually make their way to Aslan's How, a tomb built around the sacrificial stone table of movie one.While all this is going on, the Telmarine Prince Caspian is having a few domestic problems after his Uncle Miraz sires a son and heir, and decides that two princes spoil the plot.  Assisted by his tutor, Caspian finds his way into the woods, where he meets the Narnians, long thought to be extinct.As you will have guessed, the Prince and the Pevensies join forces with the Narnians to oppose the heavily armed and armored Telmarine forces, and the majority of the movie revolves around the epic battles and skirmishes.  Also in the movie, but played down to an extent, is the religious symbolism of the lion Aslan, and the simple faith of the youngest child, Lucy.  The characters of Peter and Susan are left to learn from their mistakes, and Edmund finally comes into his own.I found the movie to be dark and somewhat violent, and even though there's no blood visibly shed on screen, it's pretty obvious that many characters die in one way or another.  Personally I have no problem with that, but I'd consider the level of maturity of a child before allowing them to watch this movie.Mostly faithful to the book, this movie is all about the action.Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1.

650802,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B00005JPH2,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[1, 3]","Disney's ""Prince Caspian"" is a fascinating twist on CS Lewis' original book. While the book has stories-within-stories and loads of info-dumps, the Disney version is more fast-paced and suspenseful. The Pevensie children come into their own (with the exception of Lucy,who is significantly absent for most of the film,becoming an anchoress for Aslan)The film opens with the birth of Caspian's (Ben Barnes) cousin to his tyrannical uncle Miraz,as well as an attempt on his life. Caspian flees into the wilderness, sounding Susan's magical horn. Barnes is convincing as the noble,yet flaky prince (with a soft center) Unfortunately,his faux Spanish accent draws parallels with Inigo Montoya. There's no Andre the Giant or Princess Buttercup.The Pevensie children return to Narnia, finding it a ruin millennia after their departure. Peter (William Moseley) comes into his own as a wise leader, yet he must yield his kingship to Caspian. Edmund (Skandar Keynes) stands out with moral strength and humility. Susan becomes a warrior princess,despite Lewis' distaste for women fighting. In the meantime, Lucy is dreamy,has visions of Aslan,and little else to do.The movie is fast-paced and exciting compared to its predecessor. The soundtrack is stirring. For purists, Disney took some risks. There's a thrilling castle siege, complete with Caspian messing it up because he confronts his aunt and uncle in their bedroom. There's also a ""romance"" between Caspian and Susan,sealed with a kiss. The Christian allegory is muted. Aslan exists as deus ex machina, serving only to save the plot. Disney also cut out the part where Aslan tells Caspian that the Telmarines are descended from mermaids and pirates.""Prince Caspian"" doesn't work theologically. It's not true to the book.

650803,AC3064RV9PV62,B00005JPH2,"A. Masion ""history lover and realist""","[7, 8]","I'm doubtful the writers involved in this travesty ever read ""Prince Caspian.""  Or worse, they DID read it and decided they could write it better.  Whatever happened, this film is a derivative work with virtually nothing in common with the novel beyond character names and locations.I'd love to say I understand why the writers and production teams would take such extreme liberties with the original story line, but the truth is I really don't understand it.  Too much effort is placed on portraying the Pevensie kids as ordinary kids (perhaps to make them more relatable and likeable to child/young adult audience.)  I found this absurd.  Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are NOT ordinary kids.  They have lived a lifetime as warriors and rulers of an unique fantasyland, grew to adulthood there, and were magically returned to their earthly/childhood forms.  These kids shouldn't be engaging in petty fistfights or rivalries.  Nor should Peter be leading his troops into ill-planned suicide missions.I found Susan's character more sympathetic but also disjointed.  As lovers of the Narnia series know, Susan is the sibling who ultimately loses faith in Narnia and pulls away from her role there.  ""Prince Caspian"" provides interesting clues and character development as to why Susan might behave this way.  A light, slightly cheesy romance element is thrown in to emphasize this.  However, Susan is also presented as a truly violent character, and I was shocked by this since it went so against the grain of the original story.Ben Barnes is gorgeous eye candy.  He's a tremendous actor, but you won't see it in this film because his role requires little of him besides looking young, studly, and a bit bewildered most of the time.Georgie Henley and Skander Keynes had the most remarkable performances in the film, probably because they were the only stars permitted to accurately portray their assigned characters.  Edmund is indeed ""King Edmund the Just"" even if he's still a young teen boy.  Clear thinking and mindful of his conscience.  And Lucy's faith and spiritual confidence based upon her closeness to Aslan is wonderful and terrifying to behold.  Her wordless confrontation of the attacking Telmarines on the bridge is possibly the one thrilling moment in this movie.  The Telmarines clearly don't know who they should fear most:  an army of Narnian creatures behind them or one little girl armed with a small dagger and flanked by an enormous lion in front of them.It's obvious the producers and writers wanted to strip this film of most of its spiritual symbolism and there was nothing else they could do except wreck the film.  I'm seriously disappointed.  Lovers of the Narnia saga know Narnia is a series of spiritually significant journeys.  Take that away and you've got nothing but generic characters and meaningless events.

For some unknown reason, I have never read the Narnia series (although they do reside in my TBR mountain), so my take on Prince Caspian reflects the fact that I look upon the plot not to see the faithfulness to the book but to see the continuity from Chronicles and the storyline as a whole.Peter becomes the brat-like teen boy I expected after no longer being High King, and I was not totally surprised to see Edmund reversing his prior role of trouble-maker and cleaning up after Peter.  Susan's aloofness was not so much her loss of position--I have always seen her as the shyest and most reserved of the quartet; it was quite nice to see her break free and begin to act more independently.  Dear Lucy with her complete faith and certainty that all will be well no matter how dark things may seem does not come across as denial of reality--it shows complete conviction in the ability of any man (or creature) to choose right over wrong.  Prince Caspian showed a healthy skepticism of Peter just often enough to infer that he also felt out of his league some of the time; all-in-all, a quite realistic portrayal of a young, untried monarch who really wants to do the right thing but is sometimes unsure what the right thing entails.This was definitely a darker tale.  The battle scenes were not the only darkness prevailing thoughout and the glimpse of the White Witch was such a powerful reminder that not all help offered is help worth taking.

The movie relies too much on heavy action sequences rather then the characters personalities and the actual plot.  What with the many added scenes that don't really help the plot and the changes of the characters that are not in the actual book.  For example: Peter and Caspian get along in the book but in the movie they are constantly bickering and fighting about the most random stuff.  Almost the whole movie is just of action sequences and a bunch of teens constantly fighting each other.  The high kings and queens are supposed to act like kings and queens rather than a bunch of whiney kids who have nothing better to do then complain about each others actions.Also the whole Caspian/Susan romance thing was totally uncalled for and it angered a whole lot of Narnia fans.  Disney made a very bad attempt to add soo much stuff in that wasn't in the book that it just seems that the Prince Caspian movie is only related to the book by name.  Not to mention that the whole ""Night raid"" thing was only added in so that Disney could appeal to the eyes of perverted teens who enjoy seeing talking animal-freaks being stabbed to death.Ben Barnes did an adequate job as Caspian but he didn't really ""WOW!"" me.  In fact most of the actors seemed the same.  They all were whiney complainers who would rather argue then do anything.  Also Caspian doesn't really act like a king and Disney definitely did some major character changes(age, looks, goofy accent).There is countless things that the movie could have left out.  The countless action sequences that aren't in the book could have been censored down or limited to only three main battles. That whole thick accent thingy was too funny to take seriously.Though the Prince Caspian movie isn't all bad.  The action sequences can appear a bit entertaining and the special effects are good(well except for Aslan).

650810,AH93HX89KVQG2,B00005JPH2,"Amy Green ""Amy Green""","[10, 12]","I have been a huge C. S. Lewis and Narnia fan practically all my life. I loved the new adaptation of LWW and was really looking forward to seeing Prince Caspian. There are some things that were captured very well, such as the lovable feisty characters of Reepicheep and the dwarf Trumpkin, and the culture of the Telmarines. Lucy and Edmund were in top form. And the visuals - the special effects, costumes, etc - were superb.But I was disappointed that they took so many departures from the book. There were some departures in LWW as well, but not quite so many. It seems most of the professional critics think the filmmakers ""improved"" on C. S. Lewis' plotting, but I disagree. I believe these differences cheapened Lewis' story.First of all, Peter was not nearly such a mess-up in the book. The only mistake he made in the book was not listening to Lucy at first when she tried to convince them that Aslan was telling them to go a certain way through the woods. He never got in a fight in the train station. He didn't plan or execute an ill-fated raid on Miraz' castle (that whole scene was an invention of the filmmakers; there was no castle raid in the book and no Narnians died in vain). And he was always respectful of Caspian; they never had any sort of `power struggle.' He relied on Aslan to be the main savior of Narnia, not himself. It was his idea to challenge Miraz to a duel, not Caspian's. This excerpt from the book shows how far the movie went away from the book in all these ways:""Now,"" said Peter... ""Aslan and the girls are somewhere close. We don't know when he will act. In his time, no doubt, not ours. In the meantime he would like us to do what we can on our own. You say, Caspian, we are not strong enough to meet Miraz in pitched battle.""""I'm afraid not, High King,"" said Caspian. He was liking Peter very much, but was rather tongue-tied....""Very well, then,"" said Peter, ""I'll send him a challege to single combat."" No one had thought of this before.""Please,"" said Caspian, ""could it not be me? I want to avenge my father.""""You're wounded,"" said Peter. ""And anyway, wouldn't he just laugh at a challenge from you? I mean, we have seen that you are a king and a warrior but he thinks of you as a kid.""Second, Susan wasn't anti-social or giving boys a fake name to put them off. She was actually much more of a brat than Peter in the book; she was mean to Lucy and wouldn't believe Lucy had seen Aslan. She and Lucy went together, with Aslan, to destroy the bridge at Beruna (which was a town with people in it). And Caspian was most certainly between 10 and 14 years old in the book and presumably too young for Susan; there was no hint of any romantic interest.Third, Aslan was much more of a presence in the book. He was a constant presence from when he led the four siblings and Trumpkin to Caspian's hideout, till the end of the book. I was disappointed that this was not the case in the movie, because Aslan is by far my favorite character in the stories.Fourth, the movie almost seemed like nothing but near-constant battle scenes with loud dramatic music. They added the extra invented castle battle scene, and left out several `non-battle' events in the book, such as Lucy and Susan freeing the town of Beruna, and two celebratory parties hosted by Aslan. I don't know if maybe this is because they were trying to make it more LOTR-ish, or more appealing to the male population, or what. But it was annoying and felt very unbalanced.The third book, ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,"" is my favorite in the Narnia series. I hope they see fit to stick more closely to the book. Although that's hard to imagine, since - gasp - there are no battle scenes in that book! Whatever will they do??

Lewis' treasured classic and the previous film installement.'Prince Caspian' does both, answering the call in a visually and emotionally fantastic film. Ben Barnes and Peter Dinklage lead the excellent new cast, joining the talented stars of the first film.'Caspian' sports improved acting over it's prequel, as the young stars have grown (both in stature and talent) with their characters. Better yet, the battles of 'Caspian' are exciting and well-paced, featuring excellent fighting sequences that push the PG rating to the max, in a good way; While the battles are not really visually violent, as there isn't a lot of blood and gore, they are conceptually violent, as the conflict and carnage can be felt much more intensely than in the first film. This leads to a stronger emotional attachment and realization of the stakes, and more exciting fights. Superb choreography as well.Ben Barnes, who from the previews I assumed would be annoying, is engaging as the title character.

And that bias may be contributing to the high rankings here. Take the name ""Narnia"" away from this movie and it's really a scattered story with special effects that drive the plot (and not the other way around) with very little going for it. If this were Wizard World 2 we would all be rating this a 2 or 3 at most.There just isn't a reason for this movie; there is no moral. The first movie is a clear allegory of the cross, Christ, and salvation. Aslan makes sense to us and his sacrifice means something. In this movie, there isn't a clear explanation for most of the story.This one question ruined the movie for me: why is Aslan missing and allowing his people to suffer? I've heard that this is an allegory of our world where God allows pain, suffering etc. In this movie Aslan shows up at the end (like he did last time) and saves the children and (few) surviving Narnians. Is this an allegory for the Return of Christ? It doesn't make sense. I don't think this can be an allegory for the End. It just doesn't fit.Other questions: why are there Spaniards in Narnia? How is that a part of the plan? Why did the children have to come back?It just wasn't impressive and the direction of these films is suddenly very much in question.I can't recommend this to anyone other than Narnia fans or people who want to be fans of Narnia (ie, Christians.)",3,Wizard World 2,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,1424,"['Lets', 'be', 'frank', 'most', 'fans', 'Narnia', 'want', 'movie', 'be', 'successful', 'bias', 'may', 'be', 'contributing', 'high', 'rankings', 'here', 'Take', 'name', 'Narnia', 'away', 'movie', 'really', 'scattered', 'story', 'special', 'effects', 'drive', 'plot', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'very', 'little', 'going', 'were', 'Wizard', 'World', '2', 'would', 'all', 'be', 'rating', '2', '3', 'most.There', 'just', ""n't"", 'reason', 'movie', 'moral', 'first', 'movie', 'clear', 'allegory', 'cross', 'Christ', 'salvation', 'Aslan', 'sense', 'sacrifice', 'something', 'movie', ""n't"", 'clear', 'explanation', 'most', 'story.This', 'one', 'question', 'ruined', 'movie', 'why', 'Aslan', 'missing', 'allowing', 'people', 'suffer', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'allegory', 'world', 'where', 'God', 'pain', 'suffering', 'etc', 'movie', 'Aslan', 'up', 'end', 'did', 'last', 'time', 'children', 'few', 'surviving', 'Narnians', 'allegory', 'Return', 'Christ', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'be', 'allegory', 'End', 'just', ""n't"", 'fit.Other', 'questions', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'Spaniards', 'Narnia', 'How', 'part', 'plan', 'Why', 'did', 'children', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressive', 'direction', 'films', 'suddenly', 'very', 'much', 'question.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'other', 'Narnia', 'fans', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'fans', 'Narnia', 'ie', 'Christians']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

The native Narnians have been forced to go into hiding, or have reverted to a wild and savage existence. Peter & Co decide to liberate Narnia with the aid of Caspian, a renegade Telmarine prince.

That's a year in London, but it has been over a thousand in Narnia. Why? Because Narnia is threatened by the takeover of Miraz, Prince Caspian's wicked uncle who killed Caspian the Ninth. Our prince is the Tenth, but may not live to rule at this rate. Miraz' wife has just presented him with a son and heir, and he has no need for Prince Caspian anymore. Indeed, he has plenty of reason to want him dead. And not just because he's way, way better looking than his rotten uncle, either. Although that turns out to matter a good bit to Queen Susan.When the children return to Narnia, they are not yet aware of what called them back. They are delighted to be there until they realize that the ruins on the top of the hill are actually of the castle where they had ruled. It's been something like 1,300 years since they left, and Narnia was conquered not long after they returned to London. They encounter dwarfs who remember that there had been The Kings and Queens of Old, as well as Aslan, whom they have not seen in a long time. The dwarfs, the talking animals, the centaurs and minotaurs, and assorted stalwart denizens of Narnia, take on the evil Miraz, who has crowned himself king, and his minions. So most of the story centers around warfare of one sort or another, but it's not blood-splashing warfare.To me, the highlight of the film is when King Peter, stalling for time as much as anything because Lucy has gone to find Aslan, challenges King Miraz to single combat, with the winner to accept the total surrender of the loser. We all know Miraz won't play fair, as just before the combat starts, he whispers to his minister to use his crossbow if the battle seems to be going against Miraz. I'm not going to give anything away here, because it is pivotal to the plot as well as the most dramatic part.And don't blame me if you get to feeling maybe Narnia and Middle Earth have a great deal in common. As Joseph Campbell would doubtless point out, both are based on classical hero myths, and so it's not surprising if they seem somewhat similar, right down to the giant elemental who . . . no, won't spoil it for you.It's fun.

Those who are familiar with the book will remember that Aslan is the most important part of the story's strength and development. It was he who called the children into Narnia for his purpose an plan. Half of the book is about Aslan and the children, so the fact that they left his importance out of the movie really ruins the story.No Aslan, no Narnia!There are a number of other aspects that do not stick to the book, but some of these could be more easily overlooked if they had not strayed from the real ""Heart"" of the story.The other big disappointment for me was how they altered Peter's character. His whole attitude changed. You never get a chance to warm up to him and in the end are almost glad that he will not be returning to Narnia. (The same can be said for Susan.)The story line seemed very weak, and the relationship that they tried to create between Caspian and Susan was totally unnecessary and I felt, helped a great deal in ruining the film as well.But if you are not interested in the faithfulness of the story, Andrew Adamson's ""Prince Caspian"" is an action packed adventure with many wonderful visual, and special effects.However, I would highly recommend that you read the story. The book has so much more richness and purpose.I wish they had stuck to this story as well as they had the ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"".I hope that they will do better on ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"".

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 1]","I think it's safe to say that the folks at Disney (the company that made this film) watched too much ofThe Lord of the Ringsand tried - and failed - to emulate it. Epic battles, living trees, and much more are pulled directly from what we saw only a few years ago under Peter Jackson's able hands. And although THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: PRINCE CASPIAN has a few ""moments"" of its own, it fails to entertain anywhere near the first film,The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.This is mostly due to the fact that we are rushed into battle scene after battle scene with little time to look at (and feel for) the characters. This is painfully obvious when we get 7/8 of the way through the film and still haven't seen Aslan but have been in so many fights that they begin to meld together. The Lord of the Rings never had this problem because the focus was kept tight on the characters, particularly the Hobbits. Which brings me to a positive point about Prince Caspian: the development of the friendship between Lucy (Georgie Henley, returning from the first Chronicles film) with that of the dwarf Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage,Death at a Funeral). Although lightly touched on by comparisons with, say, Samwise and Frodo, the connection between dwarf and young queen was powerful enough to make me care a bit about what happened to them.The downsides, however, are just too numerous. The almost bratty nature of Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes,Stardust) made the main character seem petulant rather than regal. And his continued arrogance toward Peter (William Moseley) was completely out of context with C.S. Lewis' novels. The repetitive battle scenes lead nowhere, and when Narnians die, we really don't feel any remorse for them as the viewer.That said, there's plenty of eye-candy in terms of CGI. It's everywhere. And it's almost too pervasive. But it is used well ...albeit often.The big question many may be asking is: ""Should I watch it?"" And the answer is a definite ""yes."" Although it's horribly flawed, it's worth watching for Lucy and Trumpkin, as well as the funny antics of Pattertwig the Squirrel and his deadly sword. And you'll need to be up on the film for the final release due out some time in the near future: THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER.

It's difficult to translate dancing trees, mythical Bacchus, and children released from stuffy institutions as a reawaking and renewed freedom of Narnia that only words and the power of imagination can explain. Winning a battle tells much more on a screen.The liberties taken to change the story for cinema worked well for visual presentation. Reality (at a PG level) was thrust into fantasy as the protagonist children struggle to save what they learned to love in Narnia while dealing with their own emotional conflicts rooted at home. I didn't care for the love interests between Susan and Caspian, but these film snippets will be a venue to explain Susan's character change of heart that happens rather abruptly in another book - and hopefully will come to film.Prince Caspian is a delightful, exciting tale, but it's not a rock-em-sock-em rollercoaser ride.

650834,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B00005JPH2,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 0]","The best way to put this is that if you read the book, you're probably going to be wondering if the people who made the movie read this book. The film may be good on its own. But in my opinion, it deviates so much from the book that the changes might have you saying (quite a bit): ""Wait a minute!""For those of you who haven't read the book, it's basically this. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy find themselves back in Narnia. Only this time, they find that time has worn away their castle. They run into the dwarf Trumpkin who tells them the story of Prince Caspian. He was raised by his uncle King Miraz who seems nice enough, and has declared Caspian his heir. But Miraz is angered when anyone talks of Aslan or other talking animals. Later, Miraz has a son of his own, and decides that Caspian is now expendable. Cornelius further explains that Miraz killed Caspian's father. Through accident, Caspian runs into other creatures including Trumpkin and Reepicheep the warrior mouse.Miraz launches an attack and that puts us back to the start of the story. Lucy sees Aslan, and  EVENTUALLY the others follow Aslan. Peter and Miraz agree to decide their dispute in trial by combat. Peter wounds Miraz, and then in treason, 2 of Miraz's own followers finish him off. (With the intent to take Narnia for themselves.) The trees then attack (on the side of good), Bacchus the god of rivers comes to help, and good wins. Caspian becomes king, and Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy return to their own world.Now to be sure, there are almost always some significant deviations when a book is put on screen. Sometimes, they are not so visible. But other times, they are visible to the point where the story suffers.I won't go through EVERY difference, because then this review will go on way too long. But there are some standout differences that don't fit.(1) The part where Miraz SEEMS nice at first is missing. (Evil really needs a moment to look nice to be effective. Even in TLTWATW, the evil queen seemed nice, and even likable at first.)(2) In the book, Caspian is NOT attacked by Reepicheep. He stumbles onto him. This attack in the film really doesn't fit.(3) In the film, Cornelius told Caspian to flee, but he never told Caspian of the murder of his father. What?! In the book, Cornelius DID tell him this important thing.(4) Peter and Caspian meet by fighting. Again, this really doesn't fit. What REALLY happened was that Caspian was in a dangerous situation, and Peter and Edmund saved him.(5) The dissension between Peter and Caspian is REALLY out of place. For one thing, Narnia is suppose to improve people. NOT cause them to degenerate as Peter is clearly doing. Furthermore, Caspian in the book is NOT an egomaniac. This REALLY hurts things.(6) Caspian's advances on Susan are most certainly NOT in the book, and this is really an annoying intrusion.(7) In the film, Miraz seems aware of treason in his ranks, but he presses forward: ""I hope you won't be disappointed when I survive."" It seems strange that he would press forward even aware of treason.(8) Miraz did obey combat rules in the book. He did not have a 'cheat code' in place. The fact that even Miraz obeys certain rules allows us to see his murder by his own people as an atrocity.(9) In the book, Peter did NOT offer to let Caspian have the deathblow. This is a major disappointing thing. (""It's not my life to take, it's his."") Part of what makes Peter's character is knowing that he is above this way of thinking. And furthermore, it destroys the art of the writing. Peter (and even Miraz) both fought fairly. And then Miraz commands just a little bit of our sympathy when he is betrayed by his own people.What saves this film is Aslan himself. He doesn't enter until about after 2 hours. But when he enters, BOY DOES HE EVER! Liam Neeson is really the perfect choice to provide the voice for Aslan.It is a good film. The scenery is nice, and you probably won't get bored. But like I said, not only are there major deviations from the book, you're probably going to notice that the structure of the story is hurt because of these deviations.If you read the book and want to find a film that follows the book, the old 80s BBC version will serve well.I'll finish by saying this is a good film. But if you read the book and are hoping to find it here, you're going to be disappointed.",3,"Good, But Suffers From Too Many Deviations",1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,4354,"['best', 'way', 'put', 'read', 'book', ""'re"", 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'wondering', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'read', 'book', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'own', 'opinion', 'so', 'much', 'book', 'changes', 'might', 'have', 'saying', 'quite', 'bit', 'Wait', 'minute', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'basically', 'Peter', 'Susan', 'Edmund', 'Lucy', 'find', 'back', 'Narnia', 'Only', 'time', 'find', 'time', 'worn', 'away', 'castle', 'run', 'dwarf', 'Trumpkin', 'who', 'story', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'was', 'raised', 'uncle', 'King', 'Miraz', 'who', 'nice', 'enough', 'declared', 'Caspian', 'heir', 'Miraz', 'angered', 'when', 'anyone', 'talks', 'Aslan', 'other', 'talking', 'animals', 'Later', 'Miraz', 'son', 'own', 'Caspian', 'now', 'expendable', 'Cornelius', 'further', 'explains', 'Miraz', 'killed', 'Caspian', 'father', 'accident', 'Caspian', 'runs', 'other', 'creatures', 'including', 'Trumpkin', 'Reepicheep', 'warrior', 'mouse.Miraz', 'attack', 'back', 'start', 'story', 'Lucy', 'Aslan', 'EVENTUALLY', 'others', 'follow', 'Aslan', 'Peter', 'Miraz', 'agree', 'decide', 'dispute', 'trial', 'combat', 'Peter', 'Miraz', 'then', 'treason', '2', 'Miraz', 'own', 'followers', 'finish', 'off', 'intent', 'take', 'Narnia', 'trees', 'then', 'attack', 'side', 'good', 'Bacchus', 'god', 'rivers', 'help', 'good', 'wins', 'Caspian', 'king', 'Peter', 'Susan', 'Edmund', 'Lucy', 'return', 'own', 'world.Now', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'significant', 'deviations', 'when', 'book', 'put', 'screen', 'Sometimes', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'visible', 'other', 'times', 'are', 'visible', 'point', 'where', 'story', 'suffers.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'EVERY', 'difference', 'then', 'review', 'will', 'go', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'are', 'standout', 'differences', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', '1', 'part', 'where', 'Miraz', 'SEEMS', 'nice', 'first', 'missing', 'Evil', 'really', 'moment', 'look', 'nice', 'be', 'effective', 'Even', 'TLTWATW', 'evil', 'queen', 'seemed', 'nice', 'even', 'likable', 'first', '2', 'book', 'Caspian', 'NOT', 'attacked', 'Reepicheep', 'attack', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'fit', '3', 'film', 'Cornelius', 'told', 'Caspian', 'flee', 'never', 'told', 'Caspian', 'murder', 'father', 'What', 'book', 'Cornelius', 'DID', 'tell', 'important', 'thing', '4', 'Peter', 'Caspian', 'meet', 'fighting', 'Again', 'really', ""n't"", 'fit', 'What', 'REALLY', 'happened', 'was', 'Caspian', 'was', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'Peter', 'Edmund', 'saved', '5', 'dissension', 'Peter', 'Caspian', 'REALLY', 'place', 'one', 'thing', 'Narnia', 'suppose', 'improve', 'people', 'NOT', 'cause', 'degenerate', 'Peter', 'clearly', 'doing', 'Furthermore', 'Caspian', 'book', 'NOT', 'egomaniac', 'REALLY', 'things', '6', 'Caspian', 'advances', 'Susan', 'are', 'most', 'certainly', 'NOT', 'book', 'really', 'annoying', 'intrusion', '7', 'film', 'Miraz', 'aware', 'treason', 'ranks', 'forward', 'hope', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'when', 'survive', 'strange', 'would', 'press', 'forward', 'even', 'aware', 'treason', '8', 'Miraz', 'did', 'obey', 'combat', 'rules', 'book', 'did', 'not', 'have', ""'cheat"", 'code', 'place', 'fact', 'even', 'Miraz', 'obeys', 'certain', 'rules', 'see', 'murder', 'own', 'people', 'atrocity', '9', 'book', 'Peter', 'did', 'NOT', 'offer', 'let', 'Caspian', 'have', 'deathblow', 'major', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'not', 'life', 'take', 'Part', 'what', 'Peter', 'character', 'knowing', 'way', 'thinking', 'furthermore', 'art', 'writing', 'Peter', 'even', 'Miraz', 'fought', 'fairly', 'then', 'Miraz', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'sympathy', 'when', 'betrayed', 'own', 'people.What', 'film', 'Aslan', ""n't"", 'enter', 'about', '2', 'hours', 'when', 'BOY', 'DOES', 'HE', 'EVER', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'really', 'perfect', 'choice', 'provide', 'voice', 'Aslan.It', 'good', 'film', 'scenery', 'nice', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'said', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'there', 'major', 'deviations', 'book', ""'re"", 'probably', 'going', 'notice', 'structure', 'story', 'hurt', 'deviations.If', 'read', 'book', 'want', 'find', 'film', 'book', 'old', '80s', 'BBC', 'version', 'will', 'serve', 'well.I', ""'ll"", 'finish', 'saying', 'good', 'film', 'read', 'book', 'are', 'hoping', 'find', 'here', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'disappointed']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian
650835,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B00005JPH2,Brian A. Schar,"[0, 0]","Sometimes a first-time big-budget feature film director achieves great things with a fresh vision and new ideas.  This is not one of those times.  The director, who has helmed big-budget animated features, has never directed a big live-action film, and it shows.  The direction is amateurish at best.  The camera work and editing are baffling in many places.  Why have an aerial shot pointing straight down for 5 seconds as our heroes go underground, when that aerial shot tracks over some grass and rocks for 5 more seconds only to go to a fade to black transition to the next pointless shot?  And parts of the movie that should be dramatic turn out to be laugh-out-loud funny (and not in a good way).  The Mexican standoff in Miraz's chambers is the prime example of this.  And the Telmarine accent - hoo boy!  Let's just say that whenever one of the Telmarines speaks, you can't help thinking of Inigo Montoya from the far-superior ""Princess Bride.""The true problem with this movie is the script.  Purists will decry any change to the source material in a motion picture; the problem is that changes necessarily have to be made to cram a novel into a 2.5 hour movie.  However, the changes here are enormous, and to no good end.  It's still unclear what's happening in half the movie, who the characters are, and why we should care.  The first Narnia movie excelled in plot and direction; ""Caspian"" is a letdown in both areas.  Let's hope that the experienced director heading ""Dawn Treader"" at Fox can do better.

Mom""","[0, 0]","This the darker, more world-weary follow-up to ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', wherein four English schoolchildren go through a mysterious old wardrobe and emerge into a wondrous enchanted land of talking animals, dancing trees, a wicked  ice-witch and the noble lion Aslan. Peter and Edmund, Susan and Lucy Pevensie ruled as kings and queens of this place, after defeating the winter witch. They ruled wisely and with success and happiness, growing into adulthood ... before abruptly returned to their prosaic real lives, as children, in World War II era Britain.  It is now a year later - and the older children have begun adjusting unhappily to the reality they were returned to. Without apparent warning, however, they are restored to Narnia - going from a dark and grimy subway platform in wartime Britain, to a sea-cave leading out to glorious sunlit seashore. Almost at once, it becomes clear that this is Narnia a thousand years later. The castle from which they governed is in ruins, and the invading Telmarines have driven the marvelous creatures - the dwarves, the talking animals, the not-so-mythical creatures into the margins, into the deep woods. Things have changed, while they were away - and almost at once they meet and strike an alliance with the fugitive Prince Caspian. He is of the Telmarine royalty, and in this millennium the rightful ruler of Narnia, but his usurping Uncle Miraz plotted to kill him, as soon as  Miraz' wife bore him a son. And that is the rest of the story - how Prince Caspian forms an alliance with not just the Pevensies, but with the original inhabitants of Narnia - the beasts and mythical creatures and even the forces of nature itself. The movie is beautifully visualized, and the locations where it was filmed are uniformly stunning - almost stars in their own right, along with the special effects.Of the lavish extras included - the usual bloopers, `making of' and `behind the scenes' features, the stand-out is an extensive look at the `pre-vis' technology. It seems that increasingly very complicated; special-effect dependent movies such as this are almost completely done in a sort of a computer-animated story-board version before shooting begins. This is done for several reasons - to work out the mechanics of the shot, to allow the actors to know what the director has in mind for a particular sequence (which may take many days or weeks to complete!) and to show to producers and investors, so that they may know what they are getting. In the case of Prince Caspian, the `pre-vis' is almost an entire secondary movie.",4,Return Delayed,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,2588,"['darker', 'more', 'world-weary', 'follow-up', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'wherein', 'four', 'English', 'schoolchildren', 'go', 'mysterious', 'old', 'wardrobe', 'emerge', 'wondrous', 'enchanted', 'land', 'talking', 'animals', 'dancing', 'trees', 'wicked', 'ice-witch', 'noble', 'lion', 'Aslan', 'Peter', 'Edmund', 'Susan', 'Lucy', 'Pevensie', 'ruled', 'kings', 'queens', 'place', 'defeating', 'winter', 'witch', 'ruled', 'wisely', 'success', 'happiness', 'growing', 'adulthood', 'before', 'abruptly', 'returned', 'prosaic', 'real', 'lives', 'children', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'era', 'Britain', 'now', 'year', 'later', 'older', 'children', 'have', 'begun', 'adjusting', 'unhappily', 'reality', 'were', 'returned', 'apparent', 'warning', 'however', 'are', 'restored', 'Narnia', 'going', 'dark', 'grimy', 'subway', 'platform', 'wartime', 'Britain', 'sea-cave', 'leading', 'out', 'glorious', 'sunlit', 'seashore', 'Almost', 'once', 'clear', 'Narnia', 'thousand', 'years', 'later', 'castle', 'governed', 'ruins', 'invading', 'Telmarines', 'have', 'driven', 'marvelous', 'creatures', 'dwarves', 'talking', 'animals', 'not-so-mythical', 'creatures', 'margins', 'deep', 'woods', 'Things', 'have', 'changed', 'were', 'away', 'almost', 'once', 'meet', 'strike', 'alliance', 'fugitive', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'Telmarine', 'royalty', 'millennium', 'rightful', 'ruler', 'Narnia', 'usurping', 'Uncle', 'Miraz', 'plotted', 'kill', 'as', 'soon', 'Miraz', 'wife', 'bore', 'son', 'rest', 'story', 'how', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'alliance', 'not', 'just', 'Pevensies', 'original', 'inhabitants', 'Narnia', 'beasts', 'mythical', 'creatures', 'even', 'forces', 'nature', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'visualized', 'locations', 'where', 'was', 'filmed', 'are', 'uniformly', 'stunning', 'almost', 'stars', 'own', 'right', 'special', 'effects.Of', 'lavish', 'extras', 'included', 'usual', 'bloopers', 'making', 'scenes', 'features', 'stand-out', 'extensive', 'look', 'pre-vis', 'technology', 'increasingly', 'very', 'complicated', 'special-effect', 'dependent', 'movies', 'such', 'are', 'almost', 'completely', 'done', 'sort', 'computer-animated', 'story-board', 'version', 'shooting', 'begins', 'done', 'several', 'reasons', 'work', 'out', 'mechanics', 'shot', 'allow', 'actors', 'know', 'what', 'director', 'mind', 'particular', 'sequence', 'may', 'take', 'many', 'days', 'weeks', 'complete', 'show', 'producers', 'investors', 'may', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'case', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'pre-vis', 'almost', 'entire', 'secondary', 'movie']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

650844,A4ZQZP41D95JO,B00005JPH2,Chad Varnadore,"[0, 0]","Where The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was more of a carbon copy of the book it was based on, Prince Caspian carries over most of the Christian themes central to the story, but makes it it's own and fresh for those that already know the book well and aren't necessarily looking for a verbatim regurgitation of what they've already read.Not surprisingly, we bookworms rarely seem to fully appreciate movies based on the books we know and love because the film fails to subscribe as precisely to the book as we would like; and if it does, it's chosen tone often still doesn't align with our own perceptions of what we read.  As an avid reader and moviegoer, I know this feeling all to well, but I also feel that thinking that way only takes away from the enjoyment and personal growth that can come from a new, fresh translation.I'll use the classic story of a sleepy valley near Tarry Town NY to illustrate my point.  As much as I loved Tim Burton's dark reimagining of Washington Irvings legendary tale, because of it, I now have a rule never to read books that are based on a movie, instead of the other way around.  Reading ""Sleepy Hollow"" the book translation was essentially like reading the movie; the book neither embellished on the movies script, nor tried to translate the films visual design, which was a huge part of the appeal, if not more intriguing than the story itself.  Neither have the many cartoons that attempt to translate Washington Irving's classic novella ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"", merited a second look.  They're fine for introducing new generations to the classic tale, but don't offer enough that is new to favor over re-reading the novella.  But Burton's Sleepy Hollow and Irving's classic novella are as dissimilar as their respective mediums. And thus can be repeatedly enjoyed individually, even one right after the other, without getting bored by watching something you just read or reading something you just saw.  Both, bring enough uniqueness to the table, that for a fan of either, it would still be worthwhile to check out the other.The same is true of Caspian.  The beloved characters and age-old premise are still there, but in addition for fans of the story to being able to actually see this fantasy world brilliantly brought to life by the pinacle of cinematic technology and an uncompromising budget, we get a fresh story that's more than just nuances in personal perception, like the first film essentially was in ways it differed fome the book.The movie is still faithful to CS Lewis's Christain allegories.  Though some side messages may have been compromised, if anything, the major ones have been magnified by changes that more appropriately compliment the cinematic medium.  Thanks to this film, we can enjoy a fresh perspective and telling on CS Lewis's heavenly inspired story from both mediums.  The movie honors both his work and God's message, dare I say even bettering it in the visual and sonic ways that only the best cinema can, but at least no less profound or worthwhile than what Lewis wrote over six decades ago in late 1949.I also enjoyed Disney's BD immensely.

Clark,"[16, 24]","I know there may be plenty of critical reviews here, but I can't resist putting my thoughts in.I'm an avid fan of the Narnia books, I've read Prince Caspian 4 or 5 times, and I was so excited when this movie came out. About halfway into the movie however, I realized to my dismay and anger that the movie was far off course from the book itself. It had non-stop battles, there was very little conversation, the storm of the castle was completly off track and never happened. The violence was very upsetting, and I acutally thought a few of my young cousins might like this movie, but after I saw the constant war and unnessessary bloodshed, I knew my cousins could never stomach this brutality. I know this movie takes in war of course, but come on! Some of that frightening aggression was unnessessary, and never happened in the book. You can make a good war movie without overdoing the violence, people.The romance between Caspian and Susan I found absurd and maddening as there was no evidence of it in the book. I think C.S. Lewis would be appualled if he could see this movie, because they warped the message he really had. Lucy never learned in this film to obey Aslan above all else, and not listen to her siblings when they doubted her, and when the other kids disregarded her warnings and travled down the road they weren't attacked as they were in the book, they never learned that Lucy was right in her forewarning. They threw away the message of following Jesus instead of other people, and replaced it with senseless war and viciousness.I was pretty dissapointed with this movie, and I'm not buying it. To parents, I feel strongly oppossed to this movie, and I don't think your little ones will like it nor will you.

650847,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B00005JPH2,Chrijeff,"[1, 1]","The second installment in the Narnia franchise (the filmmakers are apparently following the chronological publication order of the books rather than their order in Narnian history) maintains the high quality of the firstThe Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Widescreen Edition)and actually improves upon the book it was based on.  It's been a year since we last saw the four Pevensie children, the Battle of Britain is over, and London is safe enough for them to go back there--or at least to pass through on their way to boarding school.  But Peter (William Moseley), in particular, finds it difficult to forget that he was a High King in Narnia for 15 years or so.  Then unknown magic draws them back to the land they once ruled--only to find that centuries have passed there, their castle of Caer Paravel is a forgotten ruin, and Narnia has been conquered by the neighboring Telmarines, who have succeeded in driving the Old Narnains--dwarves, fauns, talking animals, centaurs, and the rest--into hiding.  The sole hope they have for freedom is the young prince, Caspian (Ben Barnes), whose uncle and guardian, Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), has recently ordered him killed upon fathering a son of his own and seizing the throne.  Caspian, it turns out, has summoned the Pevensies back by means of Susan's (Anna Popplewell) ivory horn--and is a bit disappointed to find out that they're only children.  But Narnia's magic is working on them already, and they may be a greater help to him than anyone knows.Once again, if you've read the book, you know what to expect in the way of plot.  The story might have benefited from giving us all the background on Caspian and his tutor, Dr. Cornelius (Vincent Grass), who was largely responsible for teaching him the true history of Narnia and inspiring him to want to rule it properly.  But it's definitely improved by a non-canonical attempt on the part of the Old Narnian army to seize Miraz's castle in the dark of night and make him a prisoner (watch for the gryphons being used, as they were in the first film, as a Narnian airborne auxiliary--almost certainly something Peter or Edmund (Skandar Keynes) thought of), and by a hint of attraction between Caspian and Susan.  Castellitto is a wonderful villain with a touch of the exotic, and, of course, the effects are dazzling, especially the battle scenes and the Old Narnians (Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard), the swashbuckling Talking Mouse, is an utter delight, and be sure to keep your eye open for the very young, and very proud, centaur colt who's part of the triumphal arch of swords with which they salute the four returned Kings and Queens).  Liam Neeson returns as the excellent voice of Aslan.  Though perhaps more savage and violent than the book, it's also much more exciting and faster-paced.

650850,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPH2,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 6]","It's rare for a sequel to outshine the original. ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"" is more focused, more exciting, more interesting, and much more entertaining than 2005's ""Narnia"" film, ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe."" The main characters are less aimless and enigmatic. The story is far more engaging. Everything in general is smoother and more developed, which is wonderful for anyone in need of a good fantasy story. It shouldn't matter if you've never read any of C.S. Lewis' original books, because in all honesty, it makes absolutely no difference--one should judge this film on its own terms and not make pointless comparisons to the source material. The important thing is that it's a good movie, plain and simple. On the whole, it very nearly gave me everything the first film did not.""Prince Caspian"" begins in the world of Narnia when Prunaprismia (Alicia Borrachero)--queen of the Telmarines--gives birth to a son. This is good news indeed for her husband, Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), because he finally has a male heir to take the place of his nephew, Prince Caspian X (Ben Barnes), who he plans to murder. Caspian's teacher, Dr. Cornelius (Vincent Grass), has known of Miraz's dastardly plan all along, so he helps Caspian escape into the woods; there, the young Prince is attacked and taken captive by a pair of dwarves, but not before blowing a white horn shaped like a lion's head.This brings the story into 1950s England, where we're reintroduced to the Pevensie siblings: Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley). After breaking up a fight between Peter and a group of schoolboys, the four siblings are magically transported from a subway station back to Narnia. They quickly realize that things are not as they were when they left: ruins of once great structures are scattered all throughout; the trees no longer dance; the great lion Aslan is nowhere to be found, and neither are the other magical creatures. They then save a bitter dwarf named Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage), after which they learn the truth: while the siblings have aged only one year since leaving, Narnia has aged hundreds of years. 1300 years, to be precise. It isn't long before they meet Prince Caspian, who comes to and realizes his destiny is restore peace between the Narnians and the Telmarines.Obviously, this has turned his world upside down. Narnia began for him as nothing more than a fairy tale; until recently, he never believed that magical creatures even existed. When he realizes that such creatures do exist, he learns that his people conquered Narnia hundreds of years ago, leading to centuries of hostility and mistrust. Since Caspian was the one that called back the Pevensies with the horn, the few remaining creatures decide to form a truce with him and work towards peace. But this can only be done with the help of the four siblings, who after 1300 years remain the rightful kings and queens of Narnia. They join with Caspian knowing that difficult times lie ahead, especially since Aslan is still missing. When a raid on Miraz's castle goes horribly wrong, tensions grow between Peter and Caspian. Both selfishly try to prove themselves when they're supposed to be allies. Peter, for one, is brave and good-hearted, but he's also impulsive, believing he never needs help because he's always in control of the situation.On the same token, Caspian lets his hatred for Miraz overshadow his main mission, which is to help the Pevensies fight; it reaches a point when he's tempted by a dwarf named Nikabrik (Warwick Davis) to resurrect the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), whose soul is trapped in an icy netherworld. The only one who seems to have a handle on the situation is Lucy, who always hoped she would someday return to Narnia, unlike Susan, who has just begun to get used to England. Lucy clings to the hope that Aslan is somehow guiding them all towards something, even when no one else believes that she's seen him. All this eventually leads to a battle near the end of the film, one that's interwoven with a climactic swordfight between Peter and Miraz. The final part of the sequence features a creature made entirely of water, a creature so impressive I was disappointed with the filmmakers for giving it such little screen time.Most of the film shows the same level of creativity, with talking badgers and centaurs and marching armies of trees included at one point or another to enhance the experience for the audience. Talking creatures have often been a lot of fun in fantasy stories, especially since they usually add a little comedy relief. The funniest character in ""Prince Caspian"" is a talking mouse named Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard), who, despite his size, is actually quite skilled with a sword, even if it's no bigger than a pencil--""Yes, I'm a mouse,"" he says just before slitting the throat of a castle guard. Even if that one moment was more disturbing than it was funny, I still feel that, overall, ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"" is a wonderful fantasy adventure. I finally felt the magical spark that eluded me in ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" an ambitious and well-intentioned film with an unfocused, underdeveloped story. I can't say how well made future ""Narnia"" films will be, but there's reason to hope for the best if they follow the same trend as ""Prince Caspian.""",4,The Boy Who Would Be King,1210896000,"05 16,

I agree with others that the battle scenes comprise too much of this movie at the expense of plot development. The parts that needed to be developed were thin at expense of lots and lots of battle scenes. Seemed like most of the movie.Lots of laughs mixed in as the characters seek to keep each other level-headed and down to earth:Admirer: ""I've seen you. Eating by yourself.""Susan: ""Yes, well, that's because I prefer to be left alone.""Admirer: ""Me, too. What's you're name?""Susan: (Irritated disgust) ""Phyllis.""Lucy, running up: ""Susan!!!""""I'm Peter. The Magnificent.""""You probably could have left that last part off.""While those types of lines were delivered very well and added to the reality and human nature of the characters, something desperately needed in a story where the characters don't show as much as they did in the first movie, sometimes I think the dynamics between the characters and the leveling jokes began to interfere; too forced in parts which made it a bit distracting, perhaps.But it was nice to see those great actors and actresses in action once again.

650855,A1OVYZPXPB0RKB,B00005JPH2,"C.J. Darlington ""Author of Thicker Than Blood...","[2, 3]","On Friday, May 16th, eager Narnia fans packed out the seats in theaters around the country to have their first glimpse at Prince Caspian, the second of C.S. Lewis' beloved series to be brought to the big screen. With a budget reportedly 20 million more than its predecessor at $200 million, expectations of what magic director Andrew Adamson and crew would dish out were running high. As the opening scene of Queen Prunaprismia giving birth played out, you could almost hear the thoughts running through everyone's heads. Would Prince Caspian be as good as the first movie? Would they stay true to the book?In this story the Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy have aged a year in England, but when they're magically transported back to Narnia they find 1300 years has passed. The land in which they grew up as Kings and Queens - The Golden Age of Narnia -- is no more. Everything and everyone they once held dear is gone. All the old Narnians (the dwarves, Centaurs, talking animals, and the like) have gone into hiding, and the Telmarines who invaded Narnia shortly after the Pevensies disappeared from the land, rule with an iron fist. But there's still hope. Queen Susan's horn is blown, and the Pevensies are called back to help a young prince claim his throne and fight the darkness and evil hovering over Narnia.Reprising their roles as the Pevensies, William Mosley (Peter), Anna Popplewell (Susan), Skandar Keynes (Edmund) and Georgie Henley (Lucy) take center stage again in Prince Caspian. But their sense of wonder and innocence found in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe has been replaced with confusion and inner turmoil, most notably in Peter. It hasn't been easy becoming a man in Narnia and then returning to England as a boy, and this is evident in his struggles. Susan is less the questioning, know-it-all girl and more the confident, warrior woman. She wields her bow and finds herself in hand-to-hand combat during several battles (a slight but welcome diversion from the book in which Susan and Lucy were never allowed to participate in the fights). Edmund has also matured into a stalwart warrior, his brother's right-hand man. Lucy is still the wonderful, trusting soul of before only this time she's a little bolder at times and stands up for what she believes. All have clearly grown up, but not so much that we can't jump right in and follow our friends in this new adventure.Tilda Swinton played the White Witch of the first film so masterfully (she does make a cameo in this one too), it was hard to imagine anyone else embodying evil to the same degree. But Sergio Castellitto as King Miraz comes oh, so close. There's nothing redeemable about this character (except perhaps his love for his son), and some actors might find that restricting. Sergio takes it and runs, able to exhibit both calm manipulation and rage all in the same scene.Though only a boy in C.S. Lewis' story, 26-year-old Ben Barnes was given the difficult task of playing the title character of the film. His age is certainly a forgivable change. By the film's end we can't imagine anyone other than him in the role.Peter Dinklage as Trumpkin and Warwick Davis as Nikabrik were also terrific cast choices. Dinklage is a master at delivering dead-pan one-liners, and Davis had some in this film as well. Anyone worrying about how they'd create Reepicheep need not have worried. The mouse comes out as valiant and humorous as we remember him. But Trufflehunter the Badger was my favorite CGI creation this time around. I felt like Lucy when I muttered to my sister Tracy in the theater, ""He's so cute!""If you thought the cinematography in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was breath-taking, Prince Caspian's is even more so. From the gorgeous mountains and crystal clear waters of New Zealand to the lush forests of the Czech Republic, they all give the film that other-worldly feel. It's not hard to picture yourself right in the middle of Narnia.Websites and fan forums have been buzzing about how the screenwriters and filmmakers had to adapt the original Prince Caspian story for the big screen. Director Andrew Adamson and others have talked about the added castle raid scene, for example, which isn't found in the book. These type of additions are understandable. There were changes in the first film too. But here in Prince Caspian I felt like perhaps everyone tried a little too hard to heighten the suspense. Granted, the original pacing of the novel was very slow. I remember as a kid finding it the hardest of the seven to read. I knew they'd need to cut out some of the drier parts and add some excitement. But, I didn't expect some of the key elements to be missing.That's not to say Prince Caspian isn't a terrific fantasy film. If you haven't read the book, then you'll love it. If you have read the book and don't care about these sort of things, then you too will find nothing but good in this movie. There's adventure, unexpected but welcome humor (watch for a scene with Reepicheep and a cat), and lots of battles. All the essence of the story has been retained. That's the important part.However, Narnia purists might have a few objections. Because of its non-stop pace, there's little time to truly get to know some of the key players before they're thrust into another battle. Take Doctor Cornelius. Our first introduction to him is when he rescues Caspian from Miraz's clutches in the middle of the night. There are no secret meetings on the roof discussing the Old Narnians. We don't see how important a role he's played in Caspian's life thus far, so there's less of an emotional pull when Caspian has to leave him. Caspian's old nurse isn't even mentioned.We're also given little time to enjoy the other Narnian creatures like Patterwig the squirrel (I don't believe he's even named in the film), The Bulgy Bears, and Giant Wimbleweather. We're expected to care about them without given time to know them. Even Aslan's role is smaller than it seems like it should be. He doesn't lead the Pevensies down into the gorge as in the book. He only appears toward the end of the film.A worry some fans had was the hinted attraction between Caspian and Susan in the trailers. Though also not in the book, rest assured. It doesn't go any further than being hinted at. Susan does kiss him goodbye (just once), but it's in front of her siblings and Aslan, so it's quite pure.The subtle spiritual message of Prince Caspian about trusting and believing in things you can't see won't be lost on Christian viewers, and it's refreshing to see movies being made that aren't afraid to include that element. C.S. Lewis would be proud that his little books are impacting so many. Fantasy and adventure movie lovers won't want to miss Prince Caspian. It's a great kick-off to the summer movie season for families and Narnia fans alike.--Reviewed by C.J.

650857,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JPH2,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 0]","The first Chronicles of Narnia movie, ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"" came out around the time that many fantasy books were being bought up and while it wasn't as affecting or as memorable, it did do its job well despite some dodgy CGI and some ineffective directing during battle scenes. But it was still a success so out of the 7 books written, the next to be made was ""Prince Caspian"" but instead of releasing it at the time of Christmas like last time, Disney decided to play with the big boys and put it in the summer, being effectively sandwiched by ""Iron Man"" and the 4th ""Indiana Jones"" and let's not forget about that certain bat movie. So ""Prince Caspian"" grew less and people didn't like the tone but will it find a bigger audience at home or was it possibly too dark and not enough magic?The Pevensie children, Lucy, Peter, Edmund and Susan, have been living in England for a year trying to get back to normal which is tough after saving the magical kingdom of Narnia. Out of the blue, they're returned to Narnia only now it's almost abandoned with nary a creature in sight, only ruins. Seems that near a millennium has passed in the land of Narnia and thanks to Telmarines, the race of men, the citizens of Narnia have been all but extinct. Rightful heir to the throne is Prince Caspian who's been targeted by death by his uncle Miraz who wishes to take over the throne and so with the help of the Pevensies and the Narnians, Caspian hopes to defeat the incoming soldiers.It's usually common practice for the second film in a series to be a little bit more darker in tone or at least more adult, thinking being that since you've grown since the last book/movie, so have the characters. But then again, Narnia is a children's series of books with adult fans and an adaptation that screams for something more exciting so it's kind of like the ""rock and a hard place"" saying. Go too dark and you've alienated mostly everyone whereas if you keep the warm, friendly family tone then you're just lightweight fun and nothing more. And I can say that ""Prince Caspian"" does maintain an excitement about it and the last battle is quite awesome however the tone and even the pacing of the film feels a bit...off and whereas the previous film had many moments of otherworldlyness and fantasy moments, this film feels more like a normal adventure film with characters in it from fantasy. Maybe if they ever make the third they'll combine the 2 and make it better but this film feels less fantasy and more adult than you'd hope a film like this to have.That being said, many elements have been improved on from the quality to the animation (save for a dodgy late film sequence involving a river) to the character performances and even Adamson's directing skills have been a little bit more improved and despite some complaints about it being too different than last time, it's still engaging and keeps your interest though I wish Aslan had a bigger role though he is that secret weapon that when unleashed, practically owns everything in the room, his limited involvement kind of hurts it and he might as well be a cameo or at least to show you that despite the talking mice and dwarves, the lion is still in the movie. Then there's the odd brief sequence from a character from the last movie that kind of gives a ""what was that for?"" feeling. But the villain is just as sinister as Tilda Swinton was and Reepicheep, a swashbuckling mouse voiced by Eddie Izzard is memorable (though sadly not used frequently) and you have a movie that works well enough for adults and even kids might like it though might need to turn down the volume a little. Even the entrance to Narnia itself this time is rather...loud.The Narnia films seem to be the easiest contender to fit alongside ""Harry Potter"" and the ""Ring"" films for some of the better fantasy adaptations but there just seems to be something not getting across, something that feels bigger than the sum of its parts where it turns from a good book adaptation to a great movie, period.

650858,A3FZEWCH8FBES,B00005JPH2,"C. L. Strand ""disney freak""","[1, 1]","I am a confirmed C.S. Lewis fan. Everyone at school knew this as I could frequently be seen toting his books around. So much so that for my final art project, painting a ceiling tile that represented a part of us that people knew from high school, I did a Narnian landscape. I saw this movie three times in theatres and rented it the day it came out even though I knew I would get it for Christmas in just in couple weeks.The movie and the book are SIMILIAR not the same. If you are a person who truly insists on book to screen purity this movie would disappoint. But for clarity and timesake the book wouldn't translate to the screen as well. Plus the film explores some interesting concepts with charactor development.In the book you start off in England, then go to Narnia where Trumpkin tells the events of the past few weeks (and centuries) to the children. In the book this works well but it just doesn't translate to a screen, where flashbacks are a way to reveal something important, not a way to start a story than come back and go forth.However, it appears that the raid on the castle is the problem most people have concerning the adaptation. There is no such raid in the book. Not even anything close. But after introducing the Pevensies in LWW it would hardly seem right that they spend the first half of the movie listening to Trumpkin talk and taking a hike. Whereas exploring the Narian landscape and its changes in a book is exciting such a thing does not translate well on screen. Your imagination has less room to run.Peter's personality is altered for the movie, but let's face it the books are more concerned with situation than charactor, at least where Peter and Susan are concerned. Peter is flat. He is just a perfect thereness in the novel. So I was very impressed with his charactor development in the movie. It is valid to wonder how a high king would feel had he been stuck back in school as a relative nobody.This is not to say the movie has no flaws. Lucy comes off a little too perfect. Peter cannot lead a charge without shouting something 'inspiring' and Susan has a bottomless quiver of arrows (These both come off as laughable). And there is a 'romance' between Susan and Prince Caspian (which is annoying but ignorable).I do feel it should be noted that this is not a movie for people to take young children to. There is quite alot of violence.I felt this movie was marvalously handled and cannot wait to see the next one which I feel will make a fun movie that is much more light-hearted.",5,Wonderful Adaptation (Warning Spoilers!),1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,2526,"['am', 'confirmed', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'fan', 'Everyone', 'school', 'knew', 'could', 'frequently', 'be', 'seen', 'toting', 'books', 'So', 'much', 'final', 'art', 'project', 'painting', 'ceiling', 'tile', 'represented', 'part', 'people', 'knew', 'high', 'school', 'did', 'Narnian', 'landscape', 'saw', 'movie', 'three', 'times', 'theatres', 'rented', 'day', 'came', 'out', 'even', 'knew', 'would', 'get', 'Christmas', 'just', 'couple', 'weeks.The', 'movie', 'book', 'are', 'SIMILIAR', 'not', 'same', 'are', 'person', 'who', 'truly', 'book', 'screen', 'purity', 'movie', 'would', 'disappoint', 'clarity', 'timesake', 'book', 'would', ""n't"", 'translate', 'screen', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'interesting', 'concepts', 'charactor', 'development.In', 'book', 'start', 'England', 'then', 'go', 'Narnia', 'where', 'Trumpkin', 'events', 'past', 'few', 'weeks', 'centuries', 'children', 'book', 'well', 'just', ""n't"", 'translate', 'screen', 'where', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'way', 'reveal', 'something', 'important', 'not', 'way', 'start', 'story', 'come', 'back', 'go', 'forth.However', 'raid', 'castle', 'problem', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'concerning', 'adaptation', 'such', 'raid', 'book', 'Not', 'even', 'anything', 'close', 'introducing', 'Pevensies', 'LWW', 'would', 'hardly', 'seem', 'right', 'spend', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'listening', 'Trumpkin', 'talk', 'taking', 'hike', 'exploring', 'Narian', 'landscape', 'changes', 'book', 'exciting', 'such', 'thing', 'not', 'translate', 'well', 'screen', 'imagination', 'less', 'room', 'run.Peter', 'personality', 'altered', 'movie', 'let', 'face', 'books', 'are', 'more', 'concerned', 'situation', 'charactor', 'least', 'where', 'Peter', 'Susan', 'are', 'concerned', 'Peter', 'flat', 'just', 'perfect', 'thereness', 'novel', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'charactor', 'development', 'movie', 'valid', 'wonder', 'how', 'high', 'king', 'would', 'feel', 'had', 'been', 'stuck', 'back', 'school', 'relative', 'nobody.This', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'flaws', 'Lucy', 'off', 'little', 'too', 'perfect', 'Peter', 'can', 'not', 'lead', 'charge', 'shouting', 'something', ""'inspiring"", 'Susan', 'bottomless', 'quiver', 'arrows', 'come', 'off', 'laughable', ""'romance"", 'Susan', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'annoying', 'ignorable', '.I', 'do', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'not', 'movie', 'people', 'take', 'young', 'children', 'quite', 'alot', 'violence.I', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'marvalously', 'handled', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'next', 'one', 'feel', 'will', 'make', 'fun', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'light-hearted']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

650860,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B00005JPH2,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 6]","One of the major problems with all film series is what might be called middle filmitis. This is when films that are not first in a series rely too heavily upon an audience's memories of earlier films to inform them of the traits of characters, the chronology of prior events, and a general knowledge of the world the film series is set in. Such is the case with the latest C.S. Lewis adapted book, The Chronicles Of Narnia: Prince Caspian. Oh, yes, there are other major flaws in this film, which I shall limn, but middle filmitis is the overarching ill that infects all others. The same was not true with the first film in the series, The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. When I reviewed that film I started out by stating that that film was 1) a more literate and less Byzantine Lord Of The Rings, 2) a deeper and more realistic Harry Potter, and 3) a more mature Oz.Well, all three claims are still true, however the series has taken a sharp downward turn toward LOTR's Byzantine darkness, Potter's shallowness, and the puerility of Oz. Prince Caspian is not a bad film, merely a passable special effects film, filled with all sorts of magical beings. Yet, part of middle filmitis creeps in right at the film's outset, when a child is born and a young man flees for his life. We know nothing of the situation, yet the film's camera work and musical score intone great drama and import into a depiction the viewer is in no way invested in. Then we see the returning children from the first film: (in ascending order of age) Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Susan (Anna Popplewell), and Peter Pevensie (William Moseley). Yet, and here is a critical point, it takes a while for the first names of our heroes to be mentioned, thus leaving first time viewers at a loss, and the family surname is never mentioned in the whole second film.Some critics have harped on the fact that the Telmarines are all swarthy Spanish Conquistadore types, while the kids are Anglo whitebreads, but for this criticism to have any weight there would have to be a much more nuanced approach to the characterization. All the Telmarines could have been Girl Scouts, and it would not have mattered, for they all act in such manifestly `bad guy' ways that their being swarthy Mediterraneans is an afterthought. Similarly, claims that the film relies too heavily on Christian iconography and a Colonial White Man's Burden mindset are rented by the utter shallowness of the screenplay. Christian/Schmistian- Aslan is just a magical lion, at home with any set of mythologies, not just the Christian one. Furthermore, since Adamson, as director, added story arcs the original book did not have, why did he not make some major changes to add zip to the tale? After all, Miraz is hardly a threat, and the fight scene between him and Peter is rather pathetic. meanwhile, the minute or two that the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) spends in the film, is far more intriguing. She would have been a far netter antagonist.Overall, The Chronicles Of Narnia: Prince Caspian is still better fare- especially for children, than any of the three overblown and pompous LOTR films, but, compared to the far superior first entry in this series, it is a profound disappointment. One only hopes that Adamson can parallax the first two films and take the few things that work well in this film, and add them back to the excellence of the first film, so that the third entry, slated for 2010, The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader, is the best of the trio.

650861,A3DGVB3T5QJNRE,B00005JPH2,Danny G.,"[24, 52]","I now understand why so many great writers will never, or only under the rarest of circumstances, allow their stories to be turned into movies while they are still alive!There's no excuse for this  horrible adaptation! - ""The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe""  was a masterpiece,  so having the  genius to make  a C. S. Lewis story into a great film was not an issue. Nor was money! Hollywood made a lot of  cash from it's first venture into Narnia! And finding four child & teen actors with fine acting talent to play the lead roles was a smash success. So why such a violent and unimaginative Prince Caspian?One can only speculate.  The screenplay, acting and passion are so lacking this time around that I truly wish this story never made it to the Big Screen! I feel this disaster of a film will even damage the Narnia ""brand."" Since making money seems to be Hollywood's only motivation in making this  film, they should know better!Prince Caspian was  all about fighting and killing, and more killing and more fighting. One scene shows the slaughtering of retreating Narnians and even the deliberate killing of one's  own soldiers in the process. If  you want to see real evil in a dumbed down fashion, you'll see plenty in this movie! NOR IS THIS FILM APPROPRIATE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN! There's certainly nothing cute or delightful about Prince Caspian!Even Aslem was portrayed as a capricious deity, who didn't lift a paw until a child had to risk her life in order to get his attention. Meanwhile, Narians are being crushed to death by flying boulders, while Aslem leisurely has a chat with her about old times.  This screenplay must have been written by an Atheist or someone with a very dark sense of humor!I frequently write reviews on films I have strong feelings about. I like to encourage people to see a good film and discourage them from seeing a bad one. Let's face it, we have so many entertainment choices. But another reason I write reviews is to congratulate Hollywood for a job well-done, or like in this case, when a film is an unmitigated disaster, I hope to affect their bottom line. Because  Hollywood is always confronted with two broad choice: To treat a story as art - with respect, passion and genius like they did in ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe;""  or do the opposite, and treat it like a commodity, which has the feeling of a product made on a factory assembly line! Memo to Hollywood: If you venture in Narnia again fire the current crew and bring in some fresh talent! I challenge you to make your next film one that will stand the test of time!Better Living Through Bad MoviesandBad Movies We Love (Plume)",1,The Dumbing Down of Narnia! C. S.

650862,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B00005JPH2,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[6, 9]","Although it didn't do as well as the first installment,The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Two-Disc Collector's Edition), I found this movie to be just as good, albeit a little darker than its predecessor. This time around, the Pevensie children are whisked unexpectedly back to Narnia when Prince Caspian summons them via a magic horn; however, 1300 years have passed from their last visit. Aslan the Lion has been missing, so it is up to the Pevensies to restore Narnia to its former glory since The Telmarines seized it, forcing the animals into hiding from the evil Miraz.This film is not only darker, but even slightly more violent, and should be watched with caution by very young children (if at all). The previous cast returns; the standout for me is Georgie Henley as Lucy. Some child actors become more self-conscious and less natural as they age; in her case, she has only improved and shows the proper mix of innocence and maturity that is required of her character. As Susan, Anna Popplewell shows a flair for comedy in her slight romance with Prince Caspian. There are nice touches linked from the previous story, especially with how Edward is able to vanquish ""a problem"" from the previous story that he was once spellbound by.Onto the extras and specs! The movie is presented in 2:40:1 ratio, with 7.1 DTS HD Master Audio (48khz/24 bit); the extras on the blu-ray are also presented in Hi-Def (1080) with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound. Needless to say, the picture and sound are fantastic on this one!Blu-ray Disc 1 Extras:* Circle-Vision Interactive: Creating The Castle Raid. Through HDRI camera technology the Disney team allows viewers to take a 360-degree look behind the scenes of the castle raid sequence. First, start off in the CIRCLE-VISION preview lobby, and choose to get a private tour of the castle raid from Director Andrew Adamson, Producer Mark Johnson, or a number of other key filmmakers and artists. Then, select one of the exclusive CIRCLE-VISION experiences to be virtually transported to the set in the Czech Republic. You'll be able to turn in any direction to explore how this sequence was created through progression reels, developmental animatics, 13 audio commentaries, pop-up facts, slide shows, and behind-the-scenes footage with cast and crew.* Enhanced Disney's BD-Live Network exclusives, interactive Narnia game, downloadable features and more.* Audio commentary with Director Andrew Adamson and the actorsDisc 2 Extras:* Inside Narnia: The Adventure Returns (34:38). Director Adamson and crew journey back to Narnia a second time. Having already got one film under his belt with this crew, Adamson discusses how it was easier not to have to re-create a camaraderie this time around. Obviously, there was also some sadness at the end of the shoot, especially for the characters who will not be part of future installments.* Sets of Narnia: A Classic Comes to Life (23:35). Locations around the globe and the challenges of inclement weather; lots of unexpected rain!* A Big Movie Comes to a Small Town (23:13). A very interesting little featurette on the town of Bovec in Slovenia. Featuring interviews with townspeople young and old (96!), it details the (positive) impact that the film crew of 1200 had on this beautiful municipality. Film dailies were actually screened in Bovec's fire department!* Previsualizing Narnia (10:03). Storyboards have gone high-tech, as much of the movie was conceptualized in what is referred to as ""pre-vis."" Using computer animation that is rough (think primitive video arcade game), the crew is able to time the movie, work out rough spots, and sell a sequence. Hand-drawn storyboards are still used at times though, especially since they are much faster to render.* Talking Animals & Walking Trees: The Magical World of Narnia (4:43)* Deleted Scenes (11:17) with intros by Director Adamson. Most of these 10 scenes were cut for pacing, and rightfully so. Still interesting to watch.* Bloopers (3:04). Most of the time I skip the bloopers, but it is great to see the fun interaction between the actors, especially the Pevensie children, who laugh, cut-up, and dance in-between takes. Especially impressive is William Moseley (Peter) in a sword fight, falling down a flight of stone steps, and continuing right on with his duel after he lands!* Secrets of the Duel (6:41) is about the duel between Peter and Miraz. The attention to detail (including the armour) is astounding, and this featurette delves into all of the intricacies of this sequence.* Becoming Trumpkin (4:46). Peter Dinklage transforms from a Hollywood actor into Trumpkin. The ordeal of having a face mask cast in latex is shown here. Ugh! Despite all of the heavy makeup, fellow cast members repeatedly talk about Peter's expressive eyes and how much they add to the character.* Warwick Davis: The Man Behind Nikabrik (11:11). His day begins at 4:37am in the Czech Republic for this featurette, followed by THREE HOURS in the makeup chair. Not very glamorous! And when it comes time to remove the makeup, as Warwick says, ""It isn't like Mrs. Doubtfire!""Easter Egg Extras:Disc 2:Main Menu>highlight 'Big Movie Comes to a Small Town'>press right arrow key on remote and a crown icon will appear>press enter to see a clip about Toasties.Main Menu>highlight 'Big Movie Comes to a Small Town'>press left button on  remote and press enter when you see the Aslan symbol at the top of the screen giving you the Skandar Keynes' Blonde Cam.Main Menu Pg. 2>highlight 'Talking Animals and Walking Trees: The Magical World of Narnia>press right arrow on remote> press enter when you see the crown icon at the bottom of the screen to see the Monster Cam.Main Menu Pg. 2>'Talking Animals and Walking Trees: The Magical World of Narnia'>press left on remote>press enter when you see the Aslan symbol at the top of the screen to see a clip about who saved Trumpkin.Main Menu Pg. 3>'highlight 'Warwick Davis: The Man Behind Nikabrik'>press right arrow key on remote>press enter when you see the crown icon highlighted to see a clip of Shane Rangi, a costume actor.Main Menu Pg. 3>'highlight 'Warwick Davis: The Man Behind Nikabrik'>press left on remote>press enter when highlighted Aslan symbol appears to see clip of K.C.

When they call for help, the four Pevensies (Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley, and Anna Popplewell) are magically summoned from England to resume their roles as the defenders of Narnia.Those who have read C.S. Lewis's gentle parables may be jarred by the shift in atmosphere.  This is a dark, grim, and scary film, which didn't bother me but may give some parents pause.  I enjoyed the scenes of court intrigue among the nobles of Telmarine, but children would probably be bored.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[11, 12]","Imagine finding a magical kingdom in another world... only to return over a thousand years later, and find it in ruins.That's the whole idea of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,"" a superb sequel to ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe."" While it has a climax that goes on WAY too long, this movie shows us the darker side of C.S. Lewis' fantastical world -- with a heavy dose of Shakespearean villains, political intrigue, and some spectacularly epic battles.It's been 1,300 years in Narnia, and the human Telmarines have invaded and driven the native Narnians underground. Aslan hasn't been seen in centuries.And when King Miraz's (Sergio Castellitto) wife gives birth to a baby boy, his nephew -- the rightful heir -- becomes an obstacle. Young Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) flees from his treacherous uncle, and is discovered by a band of Narnians. Along the way, he accidentally ends up summoning the ancient Kings and Queens of Narnia -- also known as the Pevensie children, who were waiting at a train station when they were unexpectedly sucked trough a tunnel.Though initially delighted to have returned to Narnia, the Pevensies are horrified when they find that their once-idyllic land has been nearly destroyed. Caspian has been organizing a ramshackle army of native Narnians, but Peter (William Moseley) finds that fighting an organized, armed force is very different from battling the White Witch. And after a disastrous attack, the Narnians are facing almost certain destruction -- but Lucy (Georgie Henley) is convinced that Aslan can somehow save them, and restore the kingdom to Prince Caspian....""Prince Caspian"" is definitely a darker story than its predecessor -- good guys die, coups fail, evil machinations succeed, the castles are grimy, some of the good guys turn bad for real, and a bleak, hopeless feeling suffuses much of the movie's second half. Even our heroes have to deal with their doubts and anger, especially since Aslan is conspicuously absent for 95% of the entire film.And if the first film was a colorful fantasy adventure, then this one is a military story with all the necessary action trappings -- spectacular aerial drops, castle-wide massacres, and a spectacular finale involving a massive pit, tree roots, a river, and catapults. But Adamson also packs in as much violence as a PG-rated movie can contain -- while there's only a few drops of actual gore, there's plenty of beheadings, shootings and stabbings.But Narnia itself has lost none of its charm, and Adamson lingers lovingly on the sunlit forests and quiet rivers for as long as he can. And though the story is grim, he sprinkles it with plenty of humor (the bound-and-gagged cat) and fairly snappy dialogue. One of the most spectacular scenes involves a very familiar character speaking from inside a sheet of shimmering ice, as Caspian is dragged into a necromancer's ritual. It's really rather creepy.Problems with the movie? Well, the climactic battle drags on for a LONG time, and every time you think it'll end, it revs back up. And those masked soldiers are a wee bit too reminiscent of ""300's"" Persians.The four Pevensie actors all do solid jobs, although William Moseley is the standout -- Peter is struggling with doubt and a bit of alpha rivalry, especially since he's used to being Narnia's top dog. Barnes starts off a little stiffly -- come on, where's the fear when you see your bed turned into a pincushion? -- but soon grows into the difficult role of a Hamlet-like prince who is struggling to become both a Narnian friend and a Telmarine king.But there's a pretty brilliant supporting cast as well: Castellitto is simply outstanding as the ruthless, icy-cold Miraz, as are Dami&aacute;n Alc&aacute;zar and Pierfrancesco Favino as his scheming advisors. Warwick Davis does a low-key, malevolent turn as Nikabrik, while Peter Dinklage is the likably brusque, cynical Trumpkin. And Eddie Izzard is top-notch as the mousy swashbuckler Reepicheep -- this could have a silly, comic-relief character, but he does end up being both adorable and formidable.There are going to be two embellished versions of the ""Prince Caspian"" blu-ray release, and the more bare-bones version basically has the film, plus an extra bonus disc with the stuff you'd expect in such a movie: bloopers, deleted scenes, and a series of featurettes about the making of the movie -- previsualization, fight choreography, sets, special effects, and the guys who play the dwarves Trumpkin and Nikabrik.""Prince Caspian"" drops the children's fantasy feeling, in favor of a darker, more militaristic story -- especially with all that father-murder stuff.

I believe that as a different medium, expectations for a film should be a clean slate.  I refuse to hate or love a film because it was unfaithful or faithful to its source material.  End of speech.My Review; (FULL OF SPOILERS)-I THOUGHT THE ENTS MADE THEIR LAST MARCH?In this, the 4th chapter in the LOTR ""Trilogy"" the Ents go on the march again.  I thought they had declared ""The last march of the Ents"" 3 films ago?  Oh well, the river gods wash away the bad guys again just like in the first film but this time the victims are humans and not the ring Wraiths.  I found this confusing since I thought the humans were the good guys in the LOTR series?  Hold on, someone is reading over my shoulder... ...what? Oh?  This isn't LOTR?  IS MY FACE RED!  Sorry.  Never mind.-LOST ON THE WAY TO HOGWARTSThis 6th entry in the ""Harry Potter"" series was a bit disappointing.  I love the Hogwarts Express but in this film the train just zooms right past Harry and friends and opens a doorway to another place that looks nothing like Hogwarts.  They certainly could not fool me into believing these were the same actors as in the first 5 Harry Potter films just by dressing them like Hogwarts students... ...what?  Not Harry Potter?  DOH!!!-WHY REMAKES SUCKI'm not sure why the powers-that-be decided to make a remake of ""The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe"" since it was just done a few years ago.  Not only do they make a half hearted re-do, but they twist around the story so it's only mildly different; very annoying.  Instead of the bad guys being scary beasts lead by a snow queen, these are now the good guys.  Instead of humans being the good guys, they are the bad guys... ...and the good guys, sort of... ... never mind!  Any way, Aslan the Lion is exactly the same in this version.  He even saves the day like in the first film (so easily that I question the need for any other heroes), even though he mutters a couple times about how things can't happen the same way twice (and yet they do).  The kids are all the same actors and I liked them in both films, especially Lucy.  And then there's Prince Caspian; he's not even in the original version... ...what?  This is a different story?  This is called ""Prince Caspian""?  MY BAD!!  Man, I am so confused!-I WAS WATCHING A FILM AND A VIDIOGAME BROKE OUT...I enjoyed the first Narnia film on a whimsical sort of level.  It was fairly harmless action with fun characters and fair to excellent Visual FX.  This film is a bit more ambitious and yet not always up to the task.  With the influx of massed hoarse and humans formations, CG was used to prevent probable animal injury.  The unfortunate result is a bunch of videogame polygon figures running about.  Some of these computer models hardly looked rendered; just awful.  Those Ents and the River Spirits were also below the state-of-the-art.  When you consider that LOTR was made 6 and 7 years ago and looks much better, that's pretty shameful.  Not all of the film looked bad, but enough did to spoil it for me.-WHO'S THE AUDIENCE?Like the first version... ...er, film, there is much violence.  Like the first film, there is little blood.  Like the first film, my 9 year old daughter was afraid of what the violence implied.  Unlike the first film, my 6 year old was bored (as were I and my wife).  The themes were dark and complex, the characters light, the casualty rate high.  The story pacing was slow, the plot full of overly convenient loopholes and the dialogue at times incoherent.  Imagine explaining the rights of royal succession to a 6 year old during a movie.  Imagine a 9 year old asking why Caspian's uncle had to wait to have a son before he could murder Caspian for the throne.  I did not have a reasonable answer (Smart girl).  This film satisfied no one while trying to satisfy everyone (at least in my family).-IN THE END......I felt gypped.  Source material not withstanding, this was really a retelling of the first film with a few little twists.  The visual FX were actually worse than the original and certainly much worse than the older films it so vividly reminded me of.  The final scene is played out with reverence and purpose; implying that some sort of lesson should be gleaned from the preceding events.  I'm not going to get into the obvious religious implications of the message but it was overly simplistic.  Finally, two characters are declared to have grown beyond Narnia when in actuality they grew little and showed much room for improvement.  Despite the attempt at spectacle, the theaters big screen exposed the bad visuals and was wasted on a story that seemed only half thought out, relying on one characters overwhelming magic to save the day.  My family and I were fairly disappointed in this fairly mediocre film.  If you are a big fan of the first film and can ignore poor visual FX, you might like this.  Otherwise wait for the rental.",3,Wait A Minute!!!

650879,A31T5ANGT3NCDR,B00005JPH2,elena maria vidal,"[8, 9]","I watched the film ""Prince Caspian"" with much the same sentiments as when first reading the book thirty years ago. At ten years old, I so loved ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" that, after doubting that the sequel could compare, I was surprised and delighted to find an even more mysterious and exciting story. The film digresses from the book but not in a devastating way. In fact, some of the changes enhance the plot and the characters.Again we join Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, also known as ""the Pevensies,"" as they are literally swept into another dimension. The youngsters still have a great deal to learn in the land of Narnia, where they formerly ruled as kings and queens. They do not recognize their kingdom at first, so greatly has it been altered by many centuries. The realization of what has been destroyed sweeps over them as they uncover artifacts of their own past, almost like finding relics of a lost and beloved faith. It is before the broken altar of the Stone Table that the past and present merge. The four Pevensies know that they must be ready to sacrifice themselves for the Narnia; they have a bond with the land which time and space cannot erase. As C. S. Lewis wrote: ""Once a king or queen in Narnia, always a king or queen in Narnia.""New friends and foes replace the old, including Prince Caspian himself, dashing, disinherited and untried. He belongs to the swarthy race of the Telmarines, descended from pirates, presumably Spanish ones, who long before stumbled into Narnia. Caspian and the Pevensies help each other not only win the freedom of Narnia, but to grow in humility and perilous self-knowledge. The rivalry between Caspian and Peter and the flicker of romance between Caspian and Susan are elements which, although not in the book, are surprisingly natural in the film. However, it was a bit odd to show a slip of a girl like Susan fighting robust, armored warriors, knocking them down.In the book, Aslan is gradually revealed to each of the main characters according to their degree of faith. The film does not do this in the same manner so when Trumpkin the dwarf finally sees Aslan the impact is lost. Indeed, Aslan is absent from most of the film and, as in the book, the heroes and heroines feel abandoned. It is a fitting allegory for the dark night of the soul experienced by those seriously struggling along in the spiritual life. Events in Narnia spiral out of control, partly through the willful behavior of the kings, who need Susan and Lucy to remind them that Someone Else is really in charge. How often we need to be reminded of the same truth.In ""Prince Caspian"" the kings and queens triumph over the ruthless Telmarines only by allowing humility, courage, and child-like trust to conquer pride, jealousy, and the reckless desire for revenge. In the meantime, myths spring to life as prophecy is fulfilled. The reclamation of Narnia does not happen without cost, without mistakes and death. Aslan returns, traditions are reclaimed as a new kingdom is built on the foundations of the old. In Narnia as in our own world, no matter how dark it may be, good can be brought out of anything.",5,Magical!!,1223596800,"10 10, 2008",2008,3153,"['watched', 'film', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'much', 'same', 'sentiments', 'when', 'first', 'reading', 'book', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'so', 'loved', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'doubting', 'sequel', 'could', 'compare', 'was', 'surprised', 'delighted', 'find', 'even', 'more', 'mysterious', 'exciting', 'story', 'film', 'book', 'not', 'devastating', 'way', 'fact', 'changes', 'enhance', 'plot', 'characters.Again', 'join', 'Peter', 'Susan', 'Edmund', 'Lucy', 'also', 'known', 'Pevensies', 'are', 'literally', 'swept', 'dimension', 'youngsters', 'still', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'learn', 'land', 'Narnia', 'where', 'formerly', 'ruled', 'kings', 'queens', 'do', 'not', 'recognize', 'kingdom', 'first', 'so', 'greatly', 'been', 'altered', 'many', 'centuries', 'realization', 'what', 'been', 'destroyed', 'sweeps', 'over', 'uncover', 'artifacts', 'own', 'past', 'almost', 'finding', 'relics', 'lost', 'beloved', 'faith', 'broken', 'altar', 'Stone', 'Table', 'past', 'present', 'merge', 'four', 'Pevensies', 'know', 'must', 'be', 'ready', 'sacrifice', 'Narnia', 'have', 'bond', 'land', 'time', 'space', 'can', 'not', 'erase', 'C.', 'S.', 'Lewis', 'wrote', 'king', 'queen', 'Narnia', 'always', 'king', 'queen', 'Narnia', 'New', 'friends', 'foes', 'replace', 'old', 'including', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'dashing', 'disinherited', 'untried', 'swarthy', 'race', 'Telmarines', 'descended', 'pirates', 'presumably', 'Spanish', 'ones', 'who', 'long', 'before', 'stumbled', 'Narnia', 'Caspian', 'Pevensies', 'help', 'other', 'not', 'only', 'win', 'freedom', 'Narnia', 'grow', 'humility', 'perilous', 'self-knowledge', 'rivalry', 'Caspian', 'Peter', 'flicker', 'romance', 'Caspian', 'Susan', 'are', 'elements', 'not', 'book', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'natural', 'film', 'However', 'was', 'bit', 'odd', 'show', 'slip', 'girl', 'Susan', 'fighting', 'robust', 'armored', 'warriors', 'knocking', 'down.In', 'book', 'Aslan', 'gradually', 'revealed', 'main', 'characters', 'according', 'degree', 'faith', 'film', 'not', 'do', 'same', 'manner', 'so', 'when', 'Trumpkin', 'dwarf', 'finally', 'Aslan', 'impact', 'lost', 'Indeed', 'Aslan', 'absent', 'most', 'film', 'book', 'heroes', 'heroines', 'feel', 'abandoned', 'fitting', 'allegory', 'dark', 'night', 'soul', 'experienced', 'seriously', 'struggling', 'along', 'spiritual', 'life', 'Events', 'Narnia', 'spiral', 'control', 'partly', 'willful', 'behavior', 'kings', 'who', 'need', 'Susan', 'Lucy', 'remind', 'Someone', 'Else', 'really', 'charge', 'How', 'often', 'need', 'be', 'reminded', 'same', 'truth.In', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'kings', 'queens', 'triumph', 'ruthless', 'Telmarines', 'only', 'allowing', 'humility', 'courage', 'child-like', 'trust', 'conquer', 'pride', 'jealousy', 'reckless', 'desire', 'revenge', 'meantime', 'myths', 'spring', 'life', 'prophecy', 'fulfilled', 'reclamation', 'Narnia', 'not', 'happen', 'cost', 'mistakes', 'death', 'Aslan', 'traditions', 'are', 'reclaimed', 'new', 'kingdom', 'built', 'foundations', 'old', 'Narnia', 'own', 'world', 'matter', 'how', 'dark', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'brought', 'anything']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

650882,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B00005JPH2,Enjolras,"[0, 0]","If you likedThe Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, I think you'll loveThe Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. Technically, as a piece of cinematography, the latter stands as a marked improvement over Andrew Adamson's first Narnia film. Better acting, better special effects, even better soundtrack. The plot also has more twists and turns, from the raid on the castle to the internecine fighting among the Telmarines.The Pevensie kids feel more comfortable with their roles, raising the level of acting up a notch. Between his accent and youthful demeanor, Ben Barnes has the right mix of prince and adventurer to fill the role of Prince Caspian. Peter Dinklage as the dwarf Trumpkin is a great addition, injecting sarcasm and cynicism into the dialogue. Even the minotaurs seem like better actors. When the rest of the army flees the enemy castle, a minotaur holds the gate open. That one act of self-sacrifice transforms the non-human Narnians into real characters, worthy of compassion, rather than mere special effects.For me, what makes this film much better thanThe Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobeis the rich villains. The Telmarines are a truly byzantine tribe of humans who invade the land of Narnia. They display a vile mix of treachery and military ethos that the White Witch, minotaur costumes, and CG wolves from the first movie just couldn't match. Their effectiveness really comes through during the raid on the castle. That battle - my favorite part of the entire film - is riveting and emotionally complex. The despair that seeps among the Narnian ranks after that defeat makesThe Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobea richer and more engaging movie than its predecessor.The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspiandoesn't break much new ground, and the general plot is the same, with an epic battle at the end. However, it represents a marked improvement overThe Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobeas a film. It's somewhat more mature and engaging, but still appropriate for kids.

I was swept away into worlds fanciful, dangerous, and often layered in symbolism. Until a few years ago, I never thought films could capture what I experienced in my own imagination.""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" was a pleasant surprise. Talking animals, the faun, and the magic of the wardrobe were all brought to life with amazing detail and warmth--or, in the case of the White Witch, chill. Despite enjoying the movie, it seemed to lack a bit of the grittier side I remembered from my own reading.""Prince Caspian"" adds that element I found missing in the first movie. Yes, it deviates from the original book quite a bit, but in all honesty, this was my least favorite book of the seven chronicles. Although liberties are taken, I believe they stay true to the heart of C.S. Lewis's writings, and they tell a stronger, more epic story. The romance element is not as heavy-handed as some have implied, and it does seem slightly forced, and yet it too seems like something possible for sons of Adam and daughters of Eve who are getting older in their Narnian roles.From fast-paced chases, attacks, escapes, and eventually a large-scale battle with some fun effects, ""Prince Caspian"" is great entertainment. I can't wait for the release of ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader,"" possibly my favorite of this series of books. Sure, there will be parts that challenge my own interpretation of the story, but there will be others--such as Reepicheep, in this one--that live up to and even surpass my expectations.

650886,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00005JPH2,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[9, 20]","Note To Andrew Adamson: You Screwed Up.First off, I really liked the first movie, it was a blend of fun, adventure and family fun with spiritual values that weren't muted by Hollywood. However, the first one was so good, it would be very hard to top it. It's possible, but not likely. And let me also say, that in this case, I don't like it when I'm right.The opening sequence, rather than the Blitz of the first film, we are thrown into the Prince running away for some reason, on the advice of his mentor, who strangely looks like a Hogwarts professor reject. Five minutes later, I'm already bored. Then we are introduced to the kids from the first movie, whose last name I will not even try to pronounce. Things are noticeably different for them. Susan has taken to lying in order to brush pompous boys off her shoulder, and Peter has taken to fighting with anybody that gives him the slightest bit of cause to do so. Why the personality changes? They long for Narnia, and are growing impatient, after all it has been a year. Then just like that, Narnia appears not in a wardrobe, but in a train station.When they get to Narnia, things are also different, there's ruins, and some creatures don't talk, and most of the rest are restless to say the least. The dwarfs for example are utterly useless and annoying, and I was actually rooting for them to be expended by the end. You know, these are the creatures who were reduced to working for the witch in the last movie? Which they say they would gladly do again.The children eventually join forces with the Spanish Prince, and decide to get the prince back his throne, using lots of useless violence. First they storm a castle, which doesn't end well. Mostly due to Caspian, who also becomes quickly unlikable. And his character only gets worse, climaxing in a scene where the dwarfs summon demons and other scary stuff that force Caspian use his blood to bring back the witch from the last movie. And this is a family movie?Note to Andrew Adamson: What in the heck were you thinking here?Then there's a swordfight with Peter and the evil king, who is eventually defeated, only to be quickly replaced by a worse guy, who is quickly defeated in an almost cameo by Aslan. What the deal there? The Lion doesn't appear till the end of the movie, and his part is so minor that it could have been easily rewritten for another character to save the day? Then the movie ends.Many words on the ending: Again, utterly pointless and forced. Why exactly are the children so willing to go back to ""earth?"" I mean, they were so mad at the beginning about not being there, then they get no leisure while they are there, and are confronted with nothing but trouble, and they're so willing to leave. They're basically like, 'Yeah, that's nice, ready to go back now, see you later, take care.' And then Peter and Susan aren't coming back? And I totally missed the point there. They've learned everything they can learn? If anything, Lucy and Edmund learned more, while the older ones kept screwing up.Note to Andrew Adamson: What the heck were you thinking?Then there's the kiss. What's the point of that, exactly? Did some movie exec say, 'Where's the kiss? We can't have a cute boy and girl without sexual-tension!' Again, like the rest of the movie, forced and pointless. They kiss, and they'll never see each other again, even though they didn't really care that much about each other in the first place.Now, don't think I didn't like the movie... well, never mind, I didn't. But there was some good points... There was Lucy! And there was the cute Badger, who had no role! And how could we forget the mouse? The cute mouse that your love for just boils over everytime you see it, except for its last scene.Wait, I forgot one last thing. When I really thought 'what the heck' during the actual movie, instead of thinking about it while trying to sleep after I got back home from the theatre, was when the trees came alive and started ""fighting"" the enemy. If that isn't the most lazy steal from The Lord of The Rings ever, I don't know what is. And that was actually one of the better parts in the whole series.Note To Andrew Adamson: What the heck?Overall, while your little children will like most of the movie, mostly thinking about the mouse, you will cringe thinking about the movie afterwards on almost every aspect. In fact, you'll think, why did I even pay to go and see the movie? But, if you take it for what it is, you'll like it better. My major problems with the movie was mostly the bad writing. Bad characters, bad scenes, bad story, and terrible ending.Hopefully, if there is a third one (and Disney will think twice before going any farther on the third one), it will be better, as it is being helmed by fresh eyes.

I thoroughly enjoyed both of these movies and consider them to be among the best of the wave of children's fantasy movies that have appeared in cinemas, following the success of the ""Harry Potter"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" films. In fact, I preferred the Narnia films to the both of these above-mentioned series. I thought they were considerably more exciting and thought the children to be far more realistically portrayed than Harry Potter and his friends.""Prince Caspian"" is essentially a war film and the film mostly comprises a series of battles. In other hands, over two hours of cinematic battles could be the sort of thing to put some audience members to sleep, from the sheer repetitiveness of what is going on, but writer/director Andrew Adamson brings enough variety to the action and also includes enough character interaction between the battles to maintain the audience's attention and to make them care about whether our heroes actually win or not.Be aware, in most countries this movie has a PG (or equivalent) rating, which suggests that this film is suitable for children. Although there is no swearing or sex, and no one actually bleeds in any of the battles, there are many elements to this film that could potentially disturb young children.

I didn't much like the first NARNIA film, mainly because of the kids. I found them terribly annoying, obnoxious, terminally cute. I figured I'd try the sequel because they're now older. Wrong. They're still annoying, especially the youngest. (I never like Shirley Temple, either.)The movie is very dark, in both senses of the word: the tone and the lighting are dim. The thing goes on far, far too long and is far too talky. The kids really have no personality and so it's hard to work up any sort of interest in them or their situation.The concept of being transported back to Narnia, but hundreds of years after their first visit, is fascinating. Time travel has always been a favorite theme of mine. But with these kids as travel companions, I'll pass on the trip.Peter Dinklage is a wonderful actor (witness THE STATION AGENT), but he's wasted in this. Ben Barnes (Prince Caspian) is an attractive guy, but he doesn't quite have the spark he needs. The only interesting character is the nasty King Miraz (Sergio Castellito), and he's killed off.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 3]","- Reepicheep, on first meeting Caspian and threatening him with his sword: ""Choose your last words carefully, Telmarine!""- Caspian: ""You are a mouse.""- Reepicheep (sighing): ""I was hoping for something a little more original.""Okay, C.S. Lewis' Narnian chronicles are hallowed stuff to me, so I'm always gonna be critical of films adapting these books. Between you and me, I wasn't so enamoured with the first one,The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Widescreen Edition), feeling that it lacked the wonder and heart of the book. Then came the sequel. I remember sitting in the theater, with my arms crossed and thinking, ""Okaaaay. Impress me.""(Some SPOILERS follow.)Thankfully, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: PRINCE CASPIAN improves on the first film. And, even if it does veer away from the source material for a bit, the crux of the story remains the same. I guess it makes sense that the titular character is given more attention, although his tepid romance with Susan (which isn't in the book) unfolds almost in passing. Ben Barnes turns in a so-so performance, his Caspian relegated to going thru the familiar heroic posturings. He's really not even the main protagonist; that would be Peter. Hopefully, Barnes's acting improves, or the script does, because he'll play an even larger role in the third film VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER. But PRINCE CASPIAN, the movie itself, is pretty damn entertaining.The movie eventually shifts its focus on the four Pevensie children, but first we get caught up with some doings in Narnia, in which many ages had elapsed and the times again are troubled. The opening passage introduces us to the young Telmarine prince, Caspian, who is very soon forced to flee from his murderous uncle and his sharp-bearded soldiers. In his meanderings in the woods, Caspian comes across the fabulous folk and Talking Beasts of Narnia, thought to have become extinct during the cruel Telmarines' reign (or was it that they were never supposed to have existed, in the first place?). Within these expatriated creatures Prince Caspian stokes the fires of rebellion. And, so, the battle is on, to reclaim the old kingdom of Narnia.Note that, in his frantic flight from his uncle, Caspian had blown an ancient mystical horn, rumored to summon aid in times of dire need. Rumor's true.Back in World War II-era England Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie have grown a year older since their unlikely adventures, and they often wonder if they'll ever set foot on Narnia again. As they await their train in the hectic railway station, they quite suddenly find themselves whisked away from the bustle of noisy old England and into desolate, unfamiliar surroundings. The Pevensies stumble onto an ancient, broken down castle, and it shockingly dawns on them that they're wandering around in the ruins of Cair Paravel, their old home when they reigned as Kings and Queens of Narnia, and when Peter was High King. They soon unearth their most cherished treasures, those gifted to them by Father Christmas: Peter's sword and shield, Susan's bow and arrows, and Lucy's tiny bottle of healing cordial (Edmund, if you recall, wasn't around when Father Christmas was doling out presents). As expected, Susan's horn is missing.The Pevensies, not long after, fight off two Telmarine soldiers on a boat and rescue their sullen captive dwarf from drowning. A further chain of events would have the children learning that thirteen hundred years had gone by, and that, in the meantime, Narnia had been invaded by the Telmarines. The children soon encounter Caspian and his ragtag troops, which then allows for the epic stuff to be unleashed and for Aslan's inevitable return.One of my gripes in the first film was that I didn't buy into the actor playing Peter. But he's better in this one. Perhaps being a few years older helped him to grow into the role. The rest of the British kids are also good, although Georgie Henley as Lucy and Skandar Keynes as Edmund had always been spot on. Edmund actually is pretty good in a swashbuckling role, and Anna Popplewell (Susan) gets to actually throw down with her bow and arrows. But, when you get right down to it, the talented Georgie Henley still provides the most heartfelt emotional punch. There's a pure simple joy, wonderful to behold, in Lucy's unbridled love for and faith in Aslan.Deciding to insert even more thrills, the film strays from the book and invents new sequences centering on Peter and Caspian's exiled, makeshift army attempting to take the fight to Caspian's uncle, who happens to rule this new Narnia. There's also the return of an old foe, that awkward thing between Caspian and Susan, and leader-of-the-pack friction developing between Peter and Caspian. And again veering away from the book, Peter demonstrates an angry, combative side, which manifests early on, in a schoolboy row back in wartime London. It's... interesting. And I guess it's better than being bland, which is what Peter was in the first film.No gripes at all about the visual effects. No gripes about the look and feel of the movie, which is remarkable and epic (although not coming near the scope of, say, LORD OF THE RINGS). New characters come in and quickly ingratiate themselves. There's the endearingly surly dwarf Trumpkin, the wise badger Trufflehunter, and the chattery squirrel Pattertwig. There's another dwarf Nikabrik, who's even surlier than Trumpkin, but he's not exactly what one would label as ""endearing."" The best Talking Beast, hands down, is Reepicheep, the chivalrous mouse who brooks no insults. Reepicheep is voiced by Eddie Izzard, who declares that his character is ""Mad Max crossed with a Storm Trooper."" One of my favorite moments in the book is of the conversation between Reepicheep and Aslan regarding the magnificent mouse's hacked-off tail. I think the movie does it justice.Three discs in this packaging, plenty of in-depth bonus stuff. Disc One offers the feature film, as well as a fun audio commentary by Director Andrew Adamson and young actors Ben Barnes (Caspian), Georgie Henley (Lucy), Skandar Keynes (Edmund), William Moseley (Peter), and Anna Popplewell (Susan).Disc Two has the making-of featurette ""Inside Narnia: The Adventure Returns"" (35 minutes long); ""Sets of Narnia: A Classic Comes to Life"" (23 minutes) is a pretty neat segment, demonstrating that the bulk of the sets aren't CG - and you do get a sense of just how huge an undertaking the set-creating process is (also features Douglas Gresham, the film's co-producer and C.S. Lewis's step-son, who here reads brief excerpts from the book); ""Big Movie Comes to a Small Town"" - focusing on the small, picturesque Slovenian town of Bovec and the logistics of shooting the sequence in which the water titan destroys the bridge (23 minutes).Also on Disc 2: ""Previsualizing Narnia"" - about an animated storyboarding device called pre-vis, used in prepping for this film (10 minutes); ""Talking Animals and Walking Trees: The Magical World of Narnia"" - the cast & crew (but mostly crew) reflect on Narnia (5 minutes, kinda dull); ten deleted scenes with director's intros (11 minutes), none of which are particularly must-see, although one deleted scene develops deeper the attraction between Caspian and Susan; some okay bloopers (3 minutes); ""Secrets of the Duel"" - how Peter and King Miraz's duel was brought to life (7 minutes); ""Becoming Trumpkin"" - focus on Peter Dinklage, who's quite terrific as Trumpkin (5 minutes); and an 11 minute look at ""Warwick Davis: The Man Behind Nikabrik"" as we follow him during one arduous day of shooting (remember him inWillow (Special Edition)?). And Disc Three is the digital copy.So, I guess I'm finally invested in this film franchise and now find myself hugely anticipating THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER, which returns Caspian, Edmund, Lucy, and Reepicheep, and also debuts the sniveling Eustace. It's a good thing that there's an ample turnover of sons of Adam and daughters of Eve in the Narnia chronicles. Else, these kid actors would be sprouting stubbles before the film series is done.

The higher star rating, the more votes, which means more like it than dislike it.  On the other hand, the dispersement of votes shows that it was not an overwhelming fan favorite.  I suggest for that reason that you do not take this review by itself in deciding whether to purchase this.Let me give the basics.  It is based on the second of C. S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia.  It has been over 20 years since I read this one, but from my memory this movie was not as faithful to the original as the first of the series was.  A lot of those changes were effective for a movie.  However, I think there was a little more romance than in the book, and more dealing with vengeance.There were two great lessons in the book.  One of them, dealing with Reepicheep (who stole the show, even though he's just a . . . sorry, my thought was not very original), was intact (after you see the movie or read the book, you'll notice the irony of the word ""intact"").  The other was juggled in the plot and lost the strength it had in the book.The special effects were great.  My favorite was the shot of an arrow speeding through the air that looked like the arrow was standing still with the background moving.Can you take your kids with you to this movie?  Sure, but I think they would have enjoyed ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" better.",5,"A Good Movie, Though I Liked The First One Better",1227571200,"11 25, 2008",2008,1386,"['First', ""'ll"", 'comment', 'spread', 'reviews', 'higher', 'star', 'rating', 'more', 'votes', 'more', 'other', 'hand', 'dispersement', 'votes', 'shows', 'was', 'not', 'overwhelming', 'fan', 'favorite', 'suggest', 'reason', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'review', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'this.Let', 'give', 'basics', 'based', 'second', 'C.', 'S.', 'Lewis', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'been', '20', 'years', 'read', 'one', 'memory', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'faithful', 'original', 'first', 'series', 'was', 'lot', 'changes', 'were', 'effective', 'movie', 'However', 'think', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'romance', 'book', 'more', 'dealing', 'vengeance.There', 'were', 'two', 'great', 'lessons', 'book', 'One', 'dealing', 'Reepicheep', 'who', 'stole', 'show', 'even', 'just', 'sorry', 'thought', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'original', 'was', 'intact', 'see', 'movie', 'read', 'book', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'irony', 'word', 'intact', 'other', 'was', 'juggled', 'plot', 'lost', 'strength', 'had', 'book.The', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'favorite', 'was', 'shot', 'arrow', 'speeding', 'air', 'looked', 'arrow', 'was', 'standing', 'still', 'background', 'moving.Can', 'take', 'kids', 'movie', 'Sure', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'better']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

But as someone who actually enjoyed the first one I was startled by how shockingly dull this snoozefest sequel is.I can sit here and spend an hour writing a review that tears the film apart bit by bit though, quite frankly, I have better things to do with my time so I will only focus on my biggest complaints.Yes, I know it's a film for kids and that it's rated PG but where is the blood? Hundreds of people, humans and creatures alike, are felled in battle but there is not one drop of blood in the whole movie. What is this teaching our children about violence exactly? Don't give me any nonsense about traumatizing them either. I sawPredator [Blu-ray] when I was a kid and I turned out fine. But this is Disney after all and the only people keeping them afloat as a studio are overprotective mothers who fear absolutely everything and are only too happy to spend money on movies and products that falsely suggest that the world is a magical and safe place (this is what you call being 'Disneyfied') and consider something as tame and boring as Prince Caspian to be dark and tough. ""You may find Narnia a more savage place than you remember,"" warns Aslan. Wow, does that mean that we'll be getting Rambo-level violence? Sadly, no. However, more people are killed in this film. Can you work that out? Because I can't.Since I haven't read the book I wasn't previously orientated as to who's who and what their motivations are, and the film doesn't make it any clearer I promise you. Far, far too often I found myself asking 'Who is he?', 'Who are they?', 'Why are all the bad guys identical to each other?', 'Why are they the bad guys again?'. 'What do they want?'. 'Why are they all Spanish?', 'Why are the kids still kids? Shouldn't they return to Narnia as adults?' And so on...and so on...The only thing this film is good for is a cure for insomnia. I know that's a childish and crass and far from being a clever soundbite but it was so catatonic that it simply is not inspiring an intelligent review out of me.Whatever charmThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe [Blu-ray] had is well and truly gone, all that's left is some pretty scenery and that's not enough to keep me interested for well over two hours.

The first movie was made extremely well, but I also know Disney has a bad habit of making awful sequels to good movies.I saw ""Prince Caspian"" in theatres and was totally amazed.  There were some changes to it.  As with the first movie, this one goes into much more detail about some of the things the book only touches on.  It doesn't stick quite as close to the book as ""The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" but the changes are made very tastefully, and most changes are minor ones made to fit with the details.This movie continues to exhibit a great storyline, very well-written characters, and many of the things we all wanted to see on screen after reading the book.

650904,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00005JPH2,Jason,"[3, 8]","Without going into too much detail about the movie, I think that it's an overall success.  Many can nitpick from beginning to end, but this is a fun, well-made movie that follows the book very closely.The four kids have grown up after a few years away from Narnia - even though the ratio of Earth years to Narnia years is roughtly 1:1300.  During that time away, the Narnians have been under siege and face the threat of extinction.  In fact, humans from that age, the Telmarines, believe the Narnians to be extinct since their ancestors have savagely attacked the Narnians for centuries.At the presetn Narnian time, Prince Caspian is about to be usurped as the ruler of Telmarine, because his uncle Miraz has just had a son who is the potential heir to a throne.  As medieval custome would have it, an assassination attempt is about to ensue.Naturally, Prince Caspian ends up summoning the Pevensies back to Narnia where they team up alongside the Narnian animals to fight against the xenophobic Telmarines.  Just as the first movie, it's still great to see the animals on the side of the humans; the fight scenes take a ton of imagination and some very believable CGI.  From gnomes to minotaurs, fawns to sphinxes, and even non-mythical animals that can speak, it's one for all and all for one.  Speaking of that philosophy, the Musketeer theme, a swashbuckling mouse stole the whole show.  From the minute he appeared, he reminded me of the cat in Shrek, with prim and proper attitude, incredible swordsmanship, and a sense of dignity as a fighter.The sweet innocence takes a back-seat in this sequel.  Whereas they were children before, the Pevensies are now much more mature - on screen as well as in real life.  It's similar to the Harry Potter series; the kids can't stay the same age and the story must evolve.  As a result, there is quite a bit more action in this movie, the battle scenes are harsher, and there is obviously some killing going on...some of which at the hands of the children.  Personally, I like this change.There are only two problems I had with the movie, both of which have been mentioned by other reviewers.  The river scene was stolen straight out of the LOTR movies, as was the tree fighting scenes.  Although, the trees didn't have faces in this version, and used their roots as strangling tools, whips, and bats.  I don't care when the books were written and who came up with the original idea first.  When someone comes out with a thunder-stealing movie before yours is supposed to be created and/or release, it should be modified for originality.  Nontheless, it's a great movie, and I'll happily devour every book-to-movie translation of the series.",5,My name is Prince Caspian.  You killed my father.

For myself, I found that key Christian symbolism (the purpose of these stories) was removed, and in its place is far too much emphasis on a statement from Aslan that things never happen the same way twice.  Beyond having no great meaning, ironically, the scene occurs twice, with Aslan saying the same thing twice about things not happening the same way twice.  Worthless.  Where is the emphasis on Nikabrik's disbelief in the Narnians' tales of a savior, and where is the emphasis on the faith of Caspian, Cornelius, and Trufflehunter in a savior that lived many years ago who not only died but lived again and will return?  Their dialogue should have been the highlight of the film as it was for me in the book.Incidentally, who else hated the repeated nauseating Reepicheep jokes?  ""You're a mouse!!""  Ugh.  They ruined such a great character.  But there are too many complaints about this film to list them all.I intend to own the version of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from the same series.

650908,A2N2S9PPHMW016,B00005JPH2,JDavid,"[12, 14]","Prior to the release of the film ""Prince Caspian"" I read that the scriptwriters were making some fairly significant revisions of the story in order to make it work better as a film.  The book Prince Caspian was described in these accounts as one of the weakest of the Chronicles of Narnia and as difficult to translate to the screen because of its narrative structure.  I took these warnings in good humor, knowing that films are usually quite different from their book sources and that such adaptations are not always bad.  I should have paid more attention to these preliminary hints of the film's direction.  After seeing the film, I was extremely disappointed in the end product.  Pathetically ironic is that fact that nearly every departure from the original story as conceived by C.S. Lewis resulted in a dilution of the story's original impact and power.  In this instance being slavishly faithful to the story would have given the film version a much better chance at achieving something worth watching.  As it was, the film has a confusing story line, less interesting and sympathetic characters when compared with the book and a much diminished sense of the divine order and purpose that pervades all of C.S. Lewis's books.Much of the book is told in a long flashback during which Trumpkin the dwarf relates to the four Pevensie children the entire background history to the story, including how Caspian assumed the leadership of Old Narnia against his uncle King Miraz and the Telmarines and Trumpkin's own capture at the hands of Miraz's forces.  In attempting to eliminate the flashback and the historical details, the filmmakers completely mangle the events that lead to the calling of the four children back into Narnia, ending up with an illogical mess.  In the book Trumpkin is one of Caspian's most important advisors and is sent out by him to see what help the blowing of Queen Susan's horn may bring.  In the film, Trumpkin appears to have been captured by Miraz prior to meeting Caspian and can have no knowledge of his history, his purpose and his plans to free Narnia.  Yet somehow this ignorant Trumpkin still leads Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy back to help this Caspian whom he cannot know anything about.  Hollywood filmmakers constantly get away with illogical story lines due to the visual nature of their medium and the uncritical habits of their viewers.  But one cannot reduce a classic children's book beloved by thoughtful people all over the world to incoherence without suffering the consequences.The scriptwriters and apparently director's lack of enthusiasm for the original story also greatly weakens the characters.  In the book Trumpkin is a lively, witty, expressive and cheerful character, a dwarf with the personality to match his red beard.  In the movie Trumpkin, astonishingly, is the opposite--stoic to the point of sullen, sardonic, glum in demeanor and rather dull.  One of the great heroes of Narnia is reduced by film to a bore.  Peter is another example of a character that the film renders unattractive and less interesting by simply departing from the book.  Originally noble and mature, the Peter of the movie has been transformed into a juvenile brawler who is jealous of Caspian and seems scarcely able to relinquish his power even at the film's end.  Caspian of the film is also a different creature altogether.  Whereas in the book one of Caspian's principle qualities was humility, the very thing that made him fit to rule Narnia in Aslan's estimation, the film Caspian is as arrogant and hot-blooded as the film Peter.  During the climactic scene when Peter is engaged in single-combat with King Miraz, Caspian rides off in love-smitten pursuit of Susan.  This detracts from the dramatic tension of the duel as well as portraying Caspian as less fit for leadership.Other viewers may attribute these changes as a legitimate move to dramatize a sleepy story.  My conclusion is that these changes were not minor or arbitrary, but stem from the writers and director's lack of sympathy with the virtuous and moral divine order that undergirds all of Lewis's writings.  Obeying and relying on Aslan is a major theme of the book Prince Caspian.  The role of Aslan in the film, while not eliminated, is significantly reduced.  He goes from the major cause behind all important action to an interesting sideshow to all the action scenes and the invented rivalry between Peter and Caspian.  Reducing Aslan's presence in the story took the heart out of Prince Caspian, and probably had a ripple affect on the characterizations described above.  In the book much of the interesting character development involves how the various personalities relate to Aslan.  The exercise and development of patience, humility, obedience and faith with respect to Aslan are central to the book.  Because of the diminution of Aslan's place in the story and the changes in story line and characters, the portrayal of the struggle to develop these virtues essentially drops out of the film narrative.Prince Caspian the film is an unengaging, uninspiring and wearisome production because it is a story without a heart.  The heart of this tale is still found in the book, where C.S. Lewis portrays exciting adventures in Narnia of characters who are challenged to follow the moral purposes of the great Aslan, creator, sustainer and redeemer of Narnia.  The creators of the film version thought they could retain a great story while making major changes to the original.  They failed because their changes were too substantive, detracting from the essence of what makes Narnia important and special.An important parallel can be drawn to ""The Lord of the Rings"" film series created by Peter Jackson.  The utterances of Jackson and his associates make it clear that they share little in common with J.R.R. Tolkien's philosophical and religious beliefs.  Yet as great admirers of his books, they strove to stay as faithful as possible in the film recreation, resulting in three films that were not only very successful, but that also pleased the majority of Tolkien fans.  Those involved in the Narnia film project and any other version of a classic and beloved book should take careful notes.  Faithfulness to the spirit of a great book as well as the details as much as possible is a great recipe for success in a film adaptation, even when one is not wholly sympathetic to the book's themes.While I believe the film Prince Caspian is an artistic failure, I am giving it two stars for some decent acting, good visuals, and some impressive special effects.",2,Disappointing

Mcelwain,"[0, 1]","The movie had good visuals and plenty of action, and had the potential for good storylines and character development - but fell short, in my view, of reaching its full potential due to an overall lack of clarity and coherence. Early on, for example, the kids were unexpectedly thrust into Narnia, but they didn't seem overly perplexed as to why this had happened. Another example occurred in subsequent scenes, when there was some confusion over who the central character was intended to be in the movie - Peter or Caspian. This point was still somewhat muddled at the end.Overall, because this movie is part of the Narnia series, it is expected to have a moral to the story. Unfortunately, the particular meaning of this movie was not as clear as it might have been. The moral, presumably, was that the characters should have sought out the lion, Aslan, right from the start, rather than trying to proceed on their own wisdom and strength. The movie could have punctuated that point better throughout the movie, in my view, and especially at the end. Although the ending is satisfying, the moral point could easily be lost on viewers.Also, the movie was rather violent - not gory, but filled with suggestions of serious violence throughout. For this reason, it's not clear that the movie is highly recommended for children.

650910,A2OP1HD9RGX5OW,B00005JPH2,"Jedidiah Palosaari ""Not My Real Name""","[4, 5]","I had thrills as the movie began.  The directors so accurately brought my imagination to life.  The ruins of Cair Paravel were exactly on target.  Here we were, after two years, back in Narnia- but with excellent CGI.  The acting by the children, especially Lucy, was great.  Nearly every mythological creature was exquisitely crafted, and Trumpkin the Dwarf and Reepicheep the mouse steal the show.You may notice I haven't talked much about the story.  It's probably because they didn't actually follow the plot ofLewis' book.That was unfortunate.  The directors decided there needed to be more action, so they added a twenty minute attacking of a castle.  This scene is nowhere in the book, but its addition accomplishes two things.  It makes the movie much more focused on violence and warfare than the book was.  And it reduces the amount of time available to spend on character development.Lewis' book had a great deal of character development.  In fact, its perhaps the most character driven of the Narnia series.  This is perhaps why the BBC decided to combine the book withThe Voyage of the Dawn Treader.  In the book we get to hear about the difficult decision to decide who is sent as representative to the duel, and whether a bear that sucks his paw would look intimidating to the enemy.  In the movie we get a brief image of a bear sucking his paw with no explanation.  There wasn't time to explain, because they spent so much time attacking the castle.Lewis writes a story about the need for justice and assisting the outcast.  Reviewers write about how the Pevensies are taught to resort to violence, because in the movie violence becomes much the central option.  Principally, the attack on the castle was preemptive on the part of the Narnians- something not attempted in the movie.  Indeed, the only one who mentions it in the book is Reepicheep, in a moment where we see how sometimes the mouse is too foolhardy.The movie feels like one action scene after another, with the end result a foregone conclusion.  Gone are the allusions and allegory ofThe Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.  Not to suggest those were missing from the book.  For Lewis crafts his book carefully to discuss in detail the meaning of faith, with long segments on how the Pevensies can learn to trust Aslan is there with them, even if they can't see him.  There is the oft-repeated theme that the most trusting are the ones who can lead, asThe Soul of Prince Caspian: Exploring Spiritual Truth in the Land of Narniareveals.  The movie only casts allusions to this.  In the book, Trumpkin denies the existence of Aslan.  In the movie, he suggests that Aslan is never around for them.  This severely reduces the drama of the final scene when Aslan meets Trumpkin.  It is as if the directors felt that that whole faith thing that Lewis was on about was just not appropriate for their movie, so they need to take it out.  This is unfortunate, for it is quite clear in the book that Aslan is the primary character- whether he is seen or unseen.  The directors also evidently didn't seem to like the idea of a bad witch as that was too un-PC, and changed her into a strange bird creature.  In their attempt to create a Harry Potter look-alike, they have taken Lewis' novel and made it a pitiful imitation.I must say though, Prince Caspian is probably the weakest of the seven books in the series.  It's hard to put it on the screen.  But if you can get through this, you can easily do the rest of the movies.  But the directors should have made a decision to stick to the spirit of Lewis, and make a movie that was character driven rather than a copy of Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe.The directors also did a good job in some changes, like adding humor, love interest, and putting women more in the thick of battle.  It was a true pleasure to exit the theatre and hear a troop of young boys arguing about who got to be the brave Lucy. You don't often get girls as the role model for young boys.The end of it all is that you should see the movie, for the special effects.  But before you do, read the book, which is superbly better, and far more philosophically coherent.  And directors, please, please, please, don't disembowl the next Narnia films.  Maintain respect for the wishes of the author you are making so much money off of.",3,I was really looking forward to this...,1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,4315,"['had', 'thrills', 'movie', 'began', 'directors', 'so', 'accurately', 'brought', 'imagination', 'life', 'ruins', 'Cair', 'Paravel', 'were', 'exactly', 'target', 'Here', 'were', 'two', 'years', 'back', 'Narnia-', 'excellent', 'CGI', 'acting', 'children', 'especially', 'Lucy', 'was', 'great', 'Nearly', 'mythological', 'creature', 'was', 'exquisitely', 'crafted', 'Trumpkin', 'Dwarf', 'Reepicheep', 'mouse', 'steal', 'show.You', 'may', 'notice', 'have', ""n't"", 'talked', 'much', 'story', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'follow', 'plot', 'ofLewis', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'directors', 'decided', 'there', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'action', 'added', 'twenty', 'minute', 'attacking', 'castle', 'scene', 'nowhere', 'book', 'addition', 'accomplishes', 'two', 'things', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'focused', 'violence', 'warfare', 'book', 'was', 'amount', 'time', 'available', 'spend', 'character', 'development.Lewis', 'book', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'character', 'development', 'fact', 'perhaps', 'most', 'character', 'driven', 'Narnia', 'series', 'perhaps', 'why', 'BBC', 'decided', 'combine', 'book', 'withThe', 'Voyage', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'book', 'get', 'hear', 'difficult', 'decision', 'decide', 'who', 'sent', 'representative', 'duel', 'bear', 'paw', 'would', 'look', 'intimidating', 'enemy', 'movie', 'get', 'brief', 'image', 'bear', 'sucking', 'paw', 'explanation', 'was', ""n't"", 'time', 'explain', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'attacking', 'castle.Lewis', 'story', 'need', 'justice', 'assisting', 'outcast', 'Reviewers', 'write', 'how', 'Pevensies', 'are', 'taught', 'resort', 'violence', 'movie', 'violence', 'becomes', 'much', 'central', 'option', 'Principally', 'attack', 'castle', 'was', 'preemptive', 'part', 'Narnians-', 'something', 'not', 'attempted', 'movie', 'Indeed', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'book', 'Reepicheep', 'moment', 'where', 'see', 'how', 'sometimes', 'mouse', 'too', 'foolhardy.The', 'movie', 'feels', 'one', 'action', 'scene', 'end', 'result', 'foregone', 'conclusion', 'Gone', 'are', 'allusions', 'allegory', 'ofThe', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'Not', 'suggest', 'were', 'missing', 'book', 'Lewis', 'crafts', 'book', 'carefully', 'discuss', 'detail', 'meaning', 'faith', 'long', 'segments', 'how', 'Pevensies', 'can', 'learn', 'trust', 'Aslan', 'there', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'oft-repeated', 'theme', 'most', 'trusting', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'can', 'lead', 'asThe', 'Soul', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'Exploring', 'Spiritual', 'Truth', 'Land', 'Narniareveals', 'movie', 'only', 'allusions', 'book', 'Trumpkin', 'existence', 'Aslan', 'movie', 'Aslan', 'never', 'around', 'severely', 'drama', 'final', 'scene', 'when', 'Aslan', 'Trumpkin', 'directors', 'felt', 'whole', 'faith', 'thing', 'Lewis', 'was', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'appropriate', 'movie', 'need', 'take', 'out', 'unfortunate', 'quite', 'clear', 'book', 'Aslan', 'primary', 'character-', 'seen', 'unseen', 'directors', 'also', 'evidently', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'like', 'idea', 'bad', 'witch', 'was', 'too', 'un-PC', 'changed', 'strange', 'bird', 'creature', 'attempt', 'create', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'look-alike', 'have', 'taken', 'Lewis', 'novel', 'made', 'pitiful', 'imitation.I', 'must', 'say', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'probably', 'weakest', 'seven', 'books', 'series', 'hard', 'put', 'screen', 'can', 'get', 'can', 'easily', 'do', 'rest', 'movies', 'directors', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'decision', 'stick', 'spirit', 'Lewis', 'make', 'movie', 'was', 'character', 'driven', 'rather', 'copy', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe.The', 'directors', 'also', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'changes', 'adding', 'humor', 'love', 'interest', 'putting', 'women', 'more', 'thick', 'battle', 'was', 'true', 'pleasure', 'exit', 'theatre', 'hear', 'troop', 'young', 'boys', 'arguing', 'who', 'got', 'be', 'brave', 'Lucy', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'get', 'girls', 'role', 'model', 'young', 'boys.The', 'end', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'do', 'read', 'book', 'superbly', 'better', 'far', 'more', 'philosophically', 'coherent', 'directors', 'please', 'please', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'disembowl', 'next', 'Narnia', 'films', 'Maintain', 'respect', 'wishes', 'author', 'are', 'making', 'so', 'much', 'money']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

For the most part, the deviations from the plot of the book were understandable. However, the whole Aslan revealing himself to the children, first to Lucy, then to Edward, then Susan and Peter was really key to the whole plot and lessons to be learned from the story. Lewis was trying to tell a good story, but he was passing on spiritual truths of Christianity as well. Edward, gets a ""Well Done"" from Aslan in the book because he trusted Lucy this time. The movie missed this ""walk of faith"" analogy almost completely. Although it did have Edward redeeming himself so to speak in a scene that isn't in the book.Oh well, the movie kept a lot of the good scenes of the books. I enjoyed it and I'll have to watch it again. Some of the changes were good. Even though PC was mainly about the war to free Narnia, I think they played up the battle too much. It will be interesting to see how they handle ""The Horse and His Boy"", which only has one battle and ""Dawntreader"" that has no battles.One other thing that ticked me off, Aslan sends Peter and Susan back, if memory serves, and tells them that they must learn to seek him there (back in England). The movie skips that part, which I thought was a key lesson from the book.The movie introduced a romance between Caspian and Susan. I think that was cool.In summary, the movie was good, but it could have been so much better. It's a children book and it feels like they are ramping up the action for adults. However, it's the adults that can take the subtlety.

There is no real justification for the filmmakers' changing the story, it is change for the sake of change. They could have adhered more closely to the book without losing anything. Caspian was my favorite book of the series, and the movie is terribly disappointing. Peter and Caspian were allies, not antagonists. For the sake of ""high concept,"" the filmmakers have pretty much gutted the story. Good luck with all that. We are stuck with this version now, in the sequence.

""A New Yorker""","[18, 24]","I already expected this to be an exciting movie, but I have to tell you that the excitement got so much higher as I watched this movie with my kids. I couldn't believe just how well this movie was, I mean the first Chronicles is a fantastic movie, but this movie takes a few steps ahead. It's definitely more mature, it takes on a lot of battle scenes, like a Lord of the Rings type of battle with a ton of creatures who are fighting for their land back. We have amazing effects, with taking badgers, goats, and mice, and the mice, this is no Puss in Boots from Shrek 2, this is the blood thirsty mice that kick butt! The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is seriously one of the best films out this year.The movie begins where the first Chronicles left off, the kids are in England, pretty depressed and miss Narnia, it's been a year, but while in a train station, they are taken away back to Narnia where it's been 1300 years. The land is in bad shape, they have been called by Prince Caspian, the kids are these legends to the Narnians, but they need the kid's help. So everyone is in for a strong battle to get Narnia back into the beautiful land it once was. Lucy is hoping to re-connect with Aslan, but everyone does not believe as strong as she does.The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is a movie that will not disappoint, I cannot believe how good this movie was, I was so excited watching all these amazing battle sequences. The plot is actually pretty easy to follow, for kids that are under 10, I'm not so sure if this is a film for them, I know that The Chronicles of Narnia is a family film, but there is quite a bit of violence in the movie, like blood, cutting, and decapitations. The effects were amazing in every way, the acting was great and even the politics were surprisingly good. All I can say is that this is a superb movie, 10 times better than the first.

However, it's less magical with less character build-up and the villians are forgettable especially compared to the White Witch. Plus some scenes you won't understand unless you read the book. Like  for instance I had no idea why the water takes the form of a bearded figure. Perhaps the book explains that but the movie doesn't. While there's also a scene where two evil creatures appear out of nowhere to try and bring the White Witch back. So yeah the direction isn't involving enough on what's going on sometimes. It's like he had too much fate in that all the viewers read the book. While action is well done but there's more action than story as well.The movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes yet it barely takes time to tell an actual story. I mean we're supposed to care about Caspian's friendship with his dwarf tudor who taught him about Narnia. But we never see Caspian as a kid being taught by him like in the book ""I only read the beginning so far"". The movie starts off with the dwarf sending an older Caspian away to safety. While by looking at the guy you wouldn't even be able to tell that he's supposed to be a dwarf. They could've at least done some CGI magic to make him look shorter but instead we get a dwarf that looks more like Santa Clause. Maybe he's not even supposed to be a dwarf in the movie but in the book he was.Despite having pleanty to complain about I still enjoyed this movie. The kid actors have improved acting wise and were up to the task. Georgie Henley who plays Lucy is still the best of them though. She's probably the most magical thing about any of the movies. While Peter Dinklage (Elf, Nip/Tuck season 4) as a dwarf is one of the only new characters I really cared about. A talking mouse with a sword does get some laughs though. Even if he is a mouse version of Puss N'Boots pretty much. Hopefully though they have more character build-up, better direction and more sense of wonder and magic in the 3rd movie.

Fortunately, there is a rightful heir, and even more fortunately, he can call on the Pevensie children to return and fight once more.For some reason I missed the Chronicles of Narnia as a child, and on first reading them as an adult I found them enjoyable but feeble compared to J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle earth.  I feared that I would have the same reactions to the movies, but I am glad to report that Prince Caspian, like its predecessor, fully depicts the grandeur, beauty, and emotions that C.S. Lewis intended.  The movie faithfully depicts the story, with some violent battle scenes, and faithfully transmits the symbolism as well.  This comes in for criticism from those who dislike the Christian message and for misinterpretation from those who claim to be ""Christian"" but wish to hijack the religion to meet their own social/political agendas.

The villains are cardboard stereotypes.The wife of a usurper to the throne gives birth to a baby so the usurper decides it is time to get rid of Prince Caspian, actor Ben Barnes, who was Dakin in the play/movie ""The History Boys.""

For a movie aimed mostly at a young audience, there is an awful lot of slaughtering of human beings and creatures going on. When adults kill adults, it's bad enough, but when youngsters are doing it, I think it sends the wrong message.The wicked witch makes a cameo appearance in a giant ice cube.

650925,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B00005JPH2,John Kwok,"[6, 8]","""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"" is destined to become a classic, fondly remembered by many as one of the best fantasy films ever made by Hollywood. Director Andrew Adamson does a better job here than in the previous film in directing an exciting, heart-pounding rendition of the classic C. S. Lewis tale which stays true in spirit to Lewis' ""Chronicles of Narnia"", even if this adaptation isn't nearly as faithful as, for example, Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"". Once more Adamson relies on excellent props and other special effects made by the New Zealand-based WETA Workshop (which was the source for the ""Lord of the Rings"" films too.), but first, and foremost, he is blessed in excellent acting from the children portraying the Pevesnie family: Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy, (Georgie Henley). Not surprisingly, Georgie Henley once more steals almost every scene she is in as the young Lucy. So does Sergio Castellitto (Protector Miraz), who portrays the cynically evil despotic ruler of the Telmarines, while Ben Barnes is quite impressive too as his nephew, the young Prince Caspian X.While a year has passed in wartime World War II London for the Pevesnie children, 1300 years have elapsed in Narnia. One day they are magically transported back, and soon find themselves rescuing a cantankerous dwarf (Peter Dinklage) who fills them in on recent Narnian history. Eventually they come across Prince Caspian too, and join forces, hoping to help the young prince in taking his rightful place as the true successor to his father, not his usurper uncle Miraz. Aided once more by a large band of centaurs, dwarves, badgers, rats, and other Narnian animals, the Pevesnie children are also reunited with the heroic god-like lion Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), as they wage a desperate struggle to free Narnia from Telmarine rule and restore young Prince Caspian to his throne.Devout fans of C. S. Lewis and ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" will enjoy this spectacular film, which, I note again, is destined to become a cinematic classic.

650928,A3F9VH8916IA40,B00005JPH2,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[3, 5]","I still remember all the hype surrounding the first Chronicles of Narnia films,The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Widescreen Edition), and for all that hype, for all that attention it received (due mainly to the success of The Lord of the Rings films) it ended up being nothing more then a kiddy version of Peter Jackson's epic masterpiece, Lord of the Rings, for kids as it were. I never understood the hype about the first Narnia movie; it really wasn't anything more than a 3 star film, hardly worth gushing over. Not Prince Caspian though, the second installment of films based on C.S. Lewis's classic booksThe Chronicles of Narnia.1,300 years have passed since the kings and queens of Narnia, Peter the High King, Lucy, Susan and Edmund left Narnia. In the time since, a race of men called the Telmarins have invaded the peaceful nation of Narnia and driven the magical inhabitants, the talking beasts, the dwarfs, centaurs, minotaur's, griffins, everything into hiding, fearing for their lives. Prince Caspian is the rightful heir to the thrown of Telmar but his scheming uncle Miraz has just had a son, a son he hopes will someday become king. In order to make this happen, however, he must first get rid of the rightful king, which sets off a chain of events eventually leading to an uprising of the Narnian people against the savage rule of the Telmarin rulers.Prince Caspian is a magical film which is, in every way, the previous films' better. Beautiful landscaping is so common in epic fantasies like this that it's almost a clich&eacute; but here it doesn't seem like a mere LOTR copy like so many others.  It's landscaping is neatly done, playing up the differences between Lewis's fantasy world and Tolkien's. The ruins of Cair Paravel, the beaches, Aslan's Howl, are all wonderfully realized. The story begins when our four kings and queens of old are summoned to Narnia, when Caspian blows Susan's horn. They are transported to their former dwelling, the castle Cair Paravel, only to find it in ruins and decay. Meeting up with a dwarf they rescue from death, they make their way across the wilderness of Narnia to meet Caspian.The power struggle between Caspian and ""High King"" Peter gives this movie great tension early on. Caspian is somewhat unsure of himself, having never led men into battle, and allows his will to be overturned by strong opponents. While Peter, by contrast, seems is too sure of himself because of his former status as ""High King"" and often times refuses to take the advice of others, namely Lucy, whom as testified to in the previous film should always be believed. Peter also refuses to heed Caspian, who's command Peter tries to usurp out of pure spite and pride. It destroys the moral of their soldiers to see their leaders do nothing but bicker and for a while this is all that these two ""wannabe"" kings accomplish.But the show stealer for this film is not the kings, the centaurs, the giant castles or even Aslan the lion but Reepicheep, a buccaneer like mouse who refuses to let his tiny little size get in the way of glory, honor and pride. Running through the ranks of Telmar soldiers he cuts them off at the knees, asks them for their final words and when they mention the obvious, ""Your a mouse"" he frustratingly replies, ""oh, you humans have no imagination."" There are few characters in any movie that are as fun to watch as Reepicheep, his antics and overly prideful sense of himself, despite his size is, as Lucy says, ""so cute,"" but don't say that in front of him. I cannot wait to see him back in the next film, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Combine all this with some amazing choreographed fight scenes and this is one amazing film.The only fault I can find in Caspian, if you can call it a fault, is that it comes AFTER The Lord of the Rings. So many plot elements have already been used in LOTR, unfortunately. So although I don't want to penalize this film for that, it does come up repeatedly. Peter and Caspian reaching for power like Boromir reaching for the ring, Susan pulling off her best Legolas impression, the water figure washing away the Telmar horses as they try to cross the river. Yes, it's true to the book for the most part, but it did seem very ringish in many parts.Prince Caspian is not going to be the best film of the year when all is said and done, but it does stand a high chance of standing up there with the best films of 2008. Although it does hold a lot of LOTR elements, I can't really fault it for that since LOTR pretty much did everything, and did everything well. I can only hold my breath for when the much awaited film, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader comes out.

Not quite good enough for a bump up to 4 though.During the first twenty minutes of the film, I was wondering what could have inspired Mike LaSalle, from the San Francisco Chronicle, to give this such a poor review. The magic of Narnia was alive in abundance, even if Caspian's home resembled Hogwart's, even though I found the decision not to develop Caspian as a character early in the film puzzling (that decision cost them in the end), and couldn't understand why Spaniards were cast as the Telmarines. Have Spaniards become evil? I wasn't aware.While I do not share Mr. LaSale's decidedly poor opinion, the film fell rapidly from an initial five-star flush to its current rating. The film was overlong by at least thirty minutes, and although the film wasted time having characters standing about, talking, thinking, looking--in essence, doing nothing--it didn't develop some of the most important relationships. Lucy called Trumpkin her ""DLF"" - dear little friend. However, I'm hard pressed to find a point prior to her labeling him as such where something happened between the two of them to justify that.Caspian (Ben Barnes) was perhaps the greatest disappointment. Not that Barnes did anything wrong, he just wasn't given much to work with. He was as cardboard as they come, and he shouldn't have been. The producers chose to stay reasonably true to the book, so why they hung Caspian out to dry is beyond me.Some of the other problems I had with the film I also have with the book, so they don't factor into my rating. That said, I do have to say *something*. Aslan allowed the Telmarines to invade Narnia, nearly wipe out all Narnians, and he didn't do a thing about it until the Pevensies came back 1300 years later? Really? Can't say I find him very inspiring. He didn't have a good explanation for his indifference in either the book or the movie, because there is no good explanation for it, aside from this being an unabashedly Christian story, written by one of last century's greatest Christian apologists, and Christianity (no offense to Christians or to Christianity) has a relationship with its God that allows for that God (and all his/her incarnations) to ignore all sorts of horrors. But Narnia is fiction, and when crafting a fictional tale one must have a better reason than, ""Well, it's all a part of a grand plan that we just don't understand. Sure, twenty million people were killed, but I'm sure we deserved it, and if we didn't, it was at least good for us.""Still, it was entertaining at times, and that earned it three stars. The film seems to have a bit of an identity complex, as if it can't decide whether it wants to be entirely aimed at children, or to be a film aimed at everyone. Having Ben Barnes cast as Caspian, who, at 26, is at least 10 year older than Caspian was in the book, is telling.I'm still interested to see if they can learn from their mistakes, capitalize on what they've earned with Reepicheep's character, and make the next movie, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, a great one. It's a compelling story, so I have high hopes for it.",3,"Disjointed and confused, the film still evoked the magic of Narnia",1211414400,"05 22, 2008",2008,3098,"['3', '1/2', 'stars', 'Not', 'quite', 'good', 'enough', 'bump', 'up', '4', 'though.During', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'was', 'wondering', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'inspired', 'Mike', 'LaSalle', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'give', 'poor', 'review', 'magic', 'Narnia', 'was', 'alive', 'abundance', 'even', 'Caspian', 'home', 'resembled', 'Hogwart', 'even', 'found', 'decision', 'not', 'develop', 'Caspian', 'character', 'early', 'film', 'puzzling', 'decision', 'cost', 'end', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Spaniards', 'were', 'cast', 'Telmarines', 'Have', 'Spaniards', 'become', 'evil', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware.While', 'do', 'not', 'share', 'Mr.', 'LaSale', 'decidedly', 'poor', 'opinion', 'film', 'fell', 'rapidly', 'initial', 'five-star', 'flush', 'current', 'rating', 'film', 'was', 'overlong', 'least', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'film', 'wasted', 'time', 'having', 'characters', 'standing', 'about', 'talking', 'thinking', 'looking', 'essence', 'doing', 'nothing', 'did', ""n't"", 'develop', 'most', 'important', 'relationships', 'Lucy', 'called', 'Trumpkin', 'DLF', 'dear', 'little', 'friend', 'However', ""'m"", 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'point', 'prior', 'labeling', 'such', 'where', 'something', 'happened', 'two', 'justify', 'that.Caspian', 'Ben', 'Barnes', 'was', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'disappointment', 'Not', 'Barnes', 'did', 'anything', 'wrong', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'work', 'was', 'as', 'cardboard', 'come', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'producers', 'chose', 'stay', 'reasonably', 'true', 'book', 'so', 'why', 'hung', 'Caspian', 'dry', 'me.Some', 'other', 'problems', 'had', 'film', 'also', 'have', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'factor', 'rating', 'said', 'do', 'have', 'say', '*something*', 'Aslan', 'allowed', 'Telmarines', 'invade', 'Narnia', 'nearly', 'wipe', 'out', 'Narnians', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'thing', 'Pevensies', 'came', 'back', '1300', 'years', 'later', 'Really', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'find', 'very', 'inspiring', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'explanation', 'indifference', 'book', 'movie', 'good', 'explanation', 'aside', 'being', 'unabashedly', 'Christian', 'story', 'written', 'one', 'last', 'century', 'greatest', 'Christian', 'apologists', 'Christianity', 'offense', 'Christians', 'Christianity', 'relationship', 'God', 'God', 'incarnations', 'ignore', 'sorts', 'horrors', 'Narnia', 'fiction', 'when', 'crafting', 'fictional', 'tale', 'one', 'must', 'have', 'better', 'reason', 'Well', 'part', 'grand', 'plan', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Sure', 'twenty', 'million', 'people', 'were', 'killed', ""'m"", 'sure', 'deserved', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'least', 'good', 'Still', 'was', 'entertaining', 'times', 'earned', 'three', 'stars', 'film', 'have', 'bit', 'identity', 'complex', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'be', 'entirely', 'aimed', 'children', 'be', 'film', 'aimed', 'everyone', 'Having', 'Ben', 'Barnes', 'cast', 'Caspian', 'who', '26', 'least', '10', 'year', 'older', 'Caspian', 'was', 'book', 'telling.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'interested', 'see', 'can', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'capitalize', 'what', ""'ve"", 'earned', 'Reepicheep', 'character', 'make', 'next', 'movie', 'Voyage', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'great', 'one', 'compelling', 'story', 'have', 'high', 'hopes']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

650931,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B00005JPH2,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[1, 1]","In 2005, Disney and Walden Media took a gamble and produced a big-budget, special-effects heavy theatrical version of C.S. Lewis' classic story, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE. The tremendous success of that film paved the way for both companies to film the remaining books in the franchise, starting with the second entry, PRINCE CASPIAN. (Actually, it's chronologically the fourth entry in the series, but that's time for another discussion.) The four children from the previous entry, Lucy, Susan, Edmond, and Peter, are called back to Narnia to do battle against the Telmarines and their ruthless ruler, Miraz. They do this with the help of the title character of this tale, Prince Caspian, who naturally turns out to be the rightful heir to Narnia's throne.One of the biggest assets about this sequel is the feel of consistency. Andrew Adamson returns to the director's chair, as do the principal actors (the Pevensie children, Liam Neeson as Aslan) and the special effects team. The adaptation of the story itself is another matter. While THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE proved to be successful in transitioning Lewis' tale to the screen, PRINCE CASPIAN was tricker. The structure of the story, half of which is an extensive flashback on the title character and his kingdom, reads better on paper than on film. A previous adaptation by BBC TV was aware of this, and cut down the story to an hour, while cutting back and forth between the children and Caspian, providing for a faster pace.Adamson's reinterpretation uses the same technique, only it omits many sequences from the original in the process; to be fair, the BBC version did this too, but some of the deletions here include character-building sequences between Caspian and his teacher, Dr. Corneilius (which the BBC version kept intact). As such, their relationship on screen feels somewhat rushed and not fully developed. For replacement, the script opts for development between two of the least well-defined children from the original--Peter and Susan. The former is more conflicted than the first (and even has a bit of a rivalry with Caspian), while the latter becomes more of a heroic figure, taking charge for the archers of Narnia. There are also a few (very scanty) flirting sequences between Susan and Caspian. These alterations may be cause for alarm with many fans of the book, but fear not--they don't come across as clumsy as they could have.If one can accept the changes made in the transition to the screen, then it is easier to appreciate PRINCE CASPIAN as a whole. The story still remains faithful in spirit, if not letter, to the original, and the magic of Lewis' world is imperishable. The CGI effects are drastically improved from the first film (Aslan in particular looks much more regal here), and the performances are splendidly done. All four of the Pevensie children show skill and enthusiasm for their roles (even William Moseley, who seemed a little stiff in the previous outing, steps up dramatically in transitioning Peter's growth into manhood), and Ben Barnes makes for a dashing, heroic Prince Caspian (although at times his fleeting Spanish accent is somewhat reminiscent of Inigo Montoya from THE PRINCESS BRIDE). Sergio Castellitto makes for an adequate villain, but not as memorable as Tilda Swinton's White Witch (who incidentally makes a brief appearance in an exhilarating scene I won't spoil for obvious reasons).However, the characters who steal the show are the animals. Aside from Aslan, the film's highlight is a swashbuckling mouse warrior named Reepicheep, brought to life with vibrant animation and a lively vocal performance by Eddie Izzard. Equally noteworthy are Peter Dinklage as Trumpkin the dwarf and Warwick Davis (yep, Willow Ufgood himself) in a brief but memorably nasty role as the corrupt dwarf Nikabrik.Despite not being as successful a transition as its predecessor, PRINCE CASPIAN is still great fun. It's not another LORD OF THE RINGS (even though there are some similarities to be had; namely the big battle sequence at the end), but for escapist simplistic fantasy, I don't hesitate to recommend it. Adamson has stated that he would be passing the director's chair to someone else for the next installment, THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER. Hopefully it will be every bit as good as these two entries are. (Word of note: this is pretty violent for a PG movie; parents should be cautioned.)",4,Worthy -- if somewhat loosely adapted -- successor to the first film.,1211155200,"05 19, 2008",2008,4431,"['2005', 'Disney', 'Walden', 'Media', 'took', 'gamble', 'produced', 'big-budget', 'special-effects', 'heavy', 'theatrical', 'version', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'classic', 'story', 'LION', 'THE', 'WITCH', 'AND', 'THE', 'WARDROBE', 'tremendous', 'success', 'film', 'paved', 'way', 'companies', 'film', 'remaining', 'books', 'franchise', 'starting', 'second', 'entry', 'PRINCE', 'CASPIAN', 'Actually', 'chronologically', 'fourth', 'entry', 'series', 'time', 'discussion', 'four', 'children', 'previous', 'entry', 'Lucy', 'Susan', 'Edmond', 'Peter', 'are', 'called', 'back', 'Narnia', 'do', 'battle', 'Telmarines', 'ruthless', 'ruler', 'Miraz', 'do', 'help', 'title', 'character', 'tale', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'who', 'naturally', 'out', 'be', 'rightful', 'heir', 'Narnia', 'throne.One', 'biggest', 'assets', 'sequel', 'feel', 'consistency', 'Andrew', 'Adamson', 'director', 'chair', 'do', 'principal', 'actors', 'Pevensie', 'children', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Aslan', 'special', 'effects', 'team', 'adaptation', 'story', 'matter', 'LION', 'THE', 'WITCH', 'AND', 'THE', 'WARDROBE', 'proved', 'be', 'successful', 'transitioning', 'Lewis', 'tale', 'screen', 'PRINCE', 'CASPIAN', 'was', 'tricker', 'structure', 'story', 'half', 'extensive', 'flashback', 'title', 'character', 'kingdom', 'better', 'paper', 'film', 'previous', 'adaptation', 'BBC', 'TV', 'was', 'aware', 'cut', 'down', 'story', 'hour', 'cutting', 'back', 'forth', 'children', 'Caspian', 'providing', 'faster', 'pace.Adamson', 'reinterpretation', 'same', 'technique', 'only', 'many', 'sequences', 'original', 'process', 'be', 'fair', 'BBC', 'version', 'did', 'too', 'deletions', 'here', 'include', 'character-building', 'sequences', 'Caspian', 'teacher', 'Dr.', 'Corneilius', 'BBC', 'version', 'kept', 'intact', 'such', 'relationship', 'screen', 'feels', 'somewhat', 'rushed', 'not', 'fully', 'developed', 'replacement', 'script', 'opts', 'development', 'two', 'least', 'well-defined', 'children', 'original', 'Peter', 'Susan', 'former', 'more', 'conflicted', 'first', 'even', 'bit', 'rivalry', 'Caspian', 'latter', 'more', 'heroic', 'figure', 'taking', 'charge', 'archers', 'Narnia', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'very', 'scanty', 'flirting', 'sequences', 'Susan', 'Caspian', 'alterations', 'may', 'be', 'cause', 'alarm', 'many', 'fans', 'book', 'fear', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'as', 'clumsy', 'could', 'have.If', 'one', 'can', 'accept', 'changes', 'made', 'transition', 'screen', 'then', 'easier', 'appreciate', 'PRINCE', 'CASPIAN', 'whole', 'story', 'still', 'faithful', 'spirit', 'not', 'letter', 'original', 'magic', 'Lewis', 'world', 'imperishable', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'drastically', 'improved', 'first', 'film', 'Aslan', 'particular', 'looks', 'much', 'more', 'regal', 'here', 'performances', 'are', 'splendidly', 'done', 'four', 'Pevensie', 'children', 'show', 'skill', 'enthusiasm', 'roles', 'even', 'William', 'Moseley', 'who', 'seemed', 'little', 'stiff', 'previous', 'outing', 'up', 'dramatically', 'transitioning', 'Peter', 'growth', 'manhood', 'Ben', 'Barnes', 'dashing', 'heroic', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'times', 'fleeting', 'Spanish', 'accent', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'Inigo', 'Montoya', 'THE', 'PRINCESS', 'BRIDE', 'Sergio', 'Castellitto', 'adequate', 'villain', 'not', 'as', 'memorable', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'White', 'Witch', 'who', 'incidentally', 'brief', 'appearance', 'exhilarating', 'scene', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'obvious', 'reasons', '.However', 'characters', 'who', 'steal', 'show', 'are', 'animals', 'Aside', 'Aslan', 'film', 'highlight', 'swashbuckling', 'mouse', 'warrior', 'named', 'Reepicheep', 'brought', 'life', 'vibrant', 'animation', 'lively', 'vocal', 'performance', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'Equally', 'noteworthy', 'are', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'Trumpkin', 'dwarf', 'Warwick', 'Davis', 'yep', 'Willow', 'Ufgood', 'brief', 'memorably', 'nasty', 'role', 'corrupt', 'dwarf', 'Nikabrik.Despite', 'not', 'being', 'successful', 'transition', 'predecessor', 'PRINCE', 'CASPIAN', 'still', 'great', 'fun', 'not', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'even', 'are', 'similarities', 'be', 'had', 'namely', 'big', 'battle', 'sequence', 'end', 'escapist', 'simplistic', 'fantasy', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'Adamson', 'stated', 'would', 'be', 'passing', 'director', 'chair', 'someone', 'else', 'next', 'installment', 'THE', 'VOYAGE', 'THE', 'DAWN', 'TREADER', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'two', 'entries', 'are', 'Word', 'note', 'pretty', 'violent', 'PG', 'movie', 'parents', 'should', 'be', 'cautioned']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

650935,A30CXBWNJ83TUG,B00005JPH2,J. Whelan,"[18, 26]","This is the second of Walden Media's adaptations of CS Lewis' Narnia Chronicles, helmed by the same writer-director, Andrew Adamson.  Parents of younger children will find it less child-friendly than the earlier film -- it is darker, more violent, with a more confusing plot, with older actors (far older than in the book), and a less of a focus on animal characters.  Older kids embarrassed by child-friendly material will probably call it an improvement (but without, I suspect, much more actual enjoyment).  On balance, I rate it no better than the first film - in that it is equally devoid of the charm, wit, humor, intelligence and moral perspective that can be found in the source novels, and with only a handful of inspired moments.Adamson continues his agenda of systematically trashing Lewis' characters.  This time, Peter gets the worst of it, being portrayed as insecure, egotistical and power hungry.  The other Pevensies fare slightly better in comparison, but they are a miserable and surly lot, apparently incapable of passing up an opportunity to hurt each-other (or anyone else) with a mean-spirited jibe.  As in the first film, every crisis is an excuse for a hellish bout of finger-pointing, blame-mongering and whining.  Adamson seems scarcely able to imagine people treating each-other any other way.That Adamson expects approval for such spitefulness is evidenced by Lucy's taunting of Trumpkin during his confrontation with Aslan (which incidentally is rather dull in comparison with the Book -- Aslan just roars at him).  This was clearly none of her business.  Had she behaved so in the book, she would surely have got a scolding from Aslan herself.Secondary characters are trashed too.  Caspian becomes a jerk for whom revenge takes precedence over concern for his subjects.  Trumpkin the Dwarf has become a dour and charm-less bore, whose interactions with the Children are devoid of any glimmer of human warmth, and who seems scarcely distinguishable from his more-villainous counterpart, Nikabrik.  Trufflehunter is entirely forgettable, and seems more like a weasel than a badger.  The Bulgy Bears -- perhaps judged not cool enough -- are entirely absent.It is in many ways more violent than the book, and in some way less so. I personally would not mind seeing Trumpkin decapitate the Hag, or Peter decapitate the treacherous Lord, as occurred in the book.  We are spared such sights here.  What is regrettable is not so much the level of graphic violence as the level of viciousness.  In the book, our heroes committed violent acts when necessary and justifiable, but also showed moral restraint, and concern for others, including enemies.  The film ups the level of casual, thoughtless killing, and eliminates most evidence of compassion and moral restraint.  If, by some chance, the heroes do show mercy, it is with the worst grace imaginable, as if the sole purpose of sparing an enemy's life were to humiliate him.One example of the film's mindset is the treatment of Reepicheep.  In the BOOK, Reepicheep, the mouse warrior, was honored and respected for his courage and chivalry.  But the idea that there might be virtues other than brute strength is apparently an alien concept to Adamson, who turns the miniscule Reepicheep into a terrifying, death-dealing monster.  During battles, he flies toward human throats with the alacrity of the Monty Python's Vicious Bunny, and in one bizarre scene, single-handedly dispatches a half-dozen Telmarine soldiers.There are many changes.  The novel had a somewhat non-linear plot, and I understand that presenting it effectively on the big screen would requires some creativity.  I agree, for instance, that starting with Caspian, and having the Pevensies appear later, is probably the best way to adapt.  Still, this could have been adapted better.  Whenever the story makes no sense, which is very frequently, you can be sure that it happened very differently in the book.  Lewis plotted his stories with care.The best scene, I thought, was Lucy dancing with the leaves.",2,"""Darker"" is not Necessarily Better",1221264000,"09 13, 2008",2008,4050,"['second', 'Walden', 'Media', 'adaptations', 'CS', 'Lewis', 'Narnia', 'Chronicles', 'helmed', 'same', 'writer-director', 'Andrew', 'Adamson', 'Parents', 'younger', 'children', 'will', 'find', 'less', 'child-friendly', 'earlier', 'film', 'darker', 'more', 'violent', 'more', 'confusing', 'plot', 'older', 'actors', 'far', 'older', 'book', 'less', 'focus', 'animal', 'characters', 'Older', 'kids', 'embarrassed', 'child-friendly', 'material', 'will', 'probably', 'call', 'improvement', 'suspect', 'much', 'more', 'actual', 'enjoyment', 'balance', 'rate', 'better', 'first', 'film', 'equally', 'devoid', 'charm', 'wit', 'humor', 'intelligence', 'moral', 'perspective', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'source', 'novels', 'only', 'handful', 'inspired', 'moments.Adamson', 'agenda', 'systematically', 'trashing', 'Lewis', 'characters', 'time', 'Peter', 'worst', 'being', 'portrayed', 'insecure', 'egotistical', 'power', 'hungry', 'other', 'Pevensies', 'fare', 'slightly', 'better', 'comparison', 'are', 'miserable', 'surly', 'lot', 'apparently', 'incapable', 'passing', 'up', 'opportunity', 'hurt', 'each-other', 'anyone', 'else', 'mean-spirited', 'jibe', 'first', 'film', 'crisis', 'excuse', 'hellish', 'bout', 'finger-pointing', 'blame-mongering', 'whining', 'Adamson', 'scarcely', 'able', 'imagine', 'people', 'treating', 'each-other', 'other', 'way.That', 'Adamson', 'approval', 'such', 'spitefulness', 'evidenced', 'Lucy', 'taunting', 'Trumpkin', 'confrontation', 'Aslan', 'incidentally', 'rather', 'dull', 'comparison', 'Book', 'Aslan', 'just', 'roars', 'was', 'clearly', 'none', 'business', 'Had', 'behaved', 'so', 'book', 'would', 'surely', 'have', 'got', 'scolding', 'Aslan', 'herself.Secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'trashed', 'too', 'Caspian', 'jerk', 'whom', 'revenge', 'precedence', 'concern', 'subjects', 'Trumpkin', 'Dwarf', 'become', 'dour', 'charm-less', 'bore', 'interactions', 'Children', 'are', 'devoid', 'glimmer', 'human', 'warmth', 'who', 'scarcely', 'distinguishable', 'more-villainous', 'counterpart', 'Nikabrik', 'Trufflehunter', 'entirely', 'forgettable', 'more', 'weasel', 'badger', 'Bulgy', 'Bears', 'perhaps', 'judged', 'not', 'cool', 'enough', 'are', 'entirely', 'absent.It', 'many', 'ways', 'more', 'violent', 'book', 'way', 'less', 'so', 'personally', 'would', 'not', 'mind', 'seeing', 'Trumpkin', 'decapitate', 'Hag', 'Peter', 'decapitate', 'treacherous', 'Lord', 'occurred', 'book', 'are', 'spared', 'such', 'sights', 'here', 'What', 'regrettable', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'level', 'graphic', 'violence', 'level', 'viciousness', 'book', 'heroes', 'committed', 'violent', 'acts', 'when', 'necessary', 'justifiable', 'also', 'showed', 'moral', 'restraint', 'concern', 'others', 'including', 'enemies', 'film', 'level', 'casual', 'thoughtless', 'killing', 'most', 'evidence', 'compassion', 'moral', 'restraint', 'chance', 'heroes', 'do', 'show', 'mercy', 'worst', 'grace', 'imaginable', 'sole', 'purpose', 'sparing', 'enemy', 'life', 'were', 'humiliate', 'him.One', 'example', 'film', 'mindset', 'treatment', 'Reepicheep', 'BOOK', 'Reepicheep', 'mouse', 'warrior', 'was', 'honored', 'respected', 'courage', 'chivalry', 'idea', 'might', 'be', 'virtues', 'other', 'brute', 'strength', 'apparently', 'alien', 'concept', 'Adamson', 'who', 'miniscule', 'Reepicheep', 'terrifying', 'death-dealing', 'monster', 'battles', 'human', 'throats', 'alacrity', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Vicious', 'Bunny', 'one', 'bizarre', 'scene', 'single-handedly', 'dispatches', 'half-dozen', 'Telmarine', 'are', 'many', 'changes', 'novel', 'had', 'somewhat', 'non-linear', 'plot', 'understand', 'presenting', 'effectively', 'big', 'screen', 'would', 'creativity', 'agree', 'instance', 'starting', 'Caspian', 'having', 'Pevensies', 'appear', 'later', 'probably', 'best', 'way', 'adapt', 'Still', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'adapted', 'better', 'Whenever', 'story', 'sense', 'very', 'frequently', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'happened', 'very', 'differently', 'book', 'Lewis', 'plotted', 'stories', 'care.The', 'best', 'scene', 'thought', 'was', 'Lucy', 'dancing', 'leaves']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

650939,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B00005JPH2,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[8, 10]","I am going to say up front that I really enjoyed this movie.  I was delighted and entertained.  Prince Caspian follows The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as the second installment of the classic Chronicles of Narnia series by C. S. Lewis.  It is a strong sequel:  the pacing is terrific, the plot moves quickly along, and the visuals are absolutely exquisite, both location and CGI.  All of the performances and characterizations are top notch.  Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy ARE the characters in my head from the books.  Aslan IS Aslan; I couldn't ask for anything more.  The introduction of Reepicheep, the valiant and loyal mouse, is wonderful.  He leaps perfectly from the book to the screen, as real and alive as I have always imagined him.  Trumpkin, Prince Caspian, the Badger, Nickabrick, the Trees (oh, those amazing Trees!!!!!), Miraz, the Doctor, etc., are all that I expected, and in many cases, more.Now, here is where it loses the star:  this movie is much more of a departure from the book than The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe was.  I can't help it, I lived in Narnia for many years.  I still visit at least once a year.  I have the chapters, the dialog, the entire series memorized.  As I watched this movie, the book was playing in parallel inside my head, so, to me, the changes and omissions were obvious.  Most of them were merely annoying, but two things really bugged me.1. The love interest between Caspian and Susan does not exist in the book. So why the need to turn this into a teen romance?  I agree with Edmund, I don't want to understand it.2. The constant sparring between Peter and Caspian is totally unnecessary, and it adds nothing, IMHO.  In the books, Peter clearly tells Caspian that he has come to put him on his throne, not to take it.  He is a very supportive friend.  So why the ""my crown is bigger than yours"" tension?  I found it ridiculous and distracting.Again, all the salient points from the book made it to the screen, and overall, I was charmed and enchanted by this movie.  Disney is doing a splendid job translating these classics to film. I hope they do all seven.  The Narnian in me just wants them to stay closer to the stories that C. S. Lewis wrote.

650945,A1W661TC1P6VQI,B00005JPH2,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[4, 7]","""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"" is the sort of movie that has one group of people it caters to and one it does not. The group the movie does not cater to is the book lovers. These people are the sort of people who read books and complain about the movies for insignificant changes. These are the sort of people who say they would have no problem with the movie if it was under a different title, a logic I've never completely understood, seeing as how book huggers still complain about ""The Secret of NIMH (original title: ""Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH""). The second type of person is the kind that likes well made movies, with good characterization and story development, and changes don't bother them as long as it doesn't effect the movie. If you are in the latter category then this movie is more likely to be your style. Set two years after the previous film, ""Prince Caspian"" revolves around the title character blowing Queen Susan's old horn, thus summoning the Pevensie children back to Narnia for another big budget adventure.Narnia is not the same place it used to be though. Though it has been only two years since the Pevensie children have been to Narnia, in Narnian time it's been 1,300 years. Which means no there's no beavers, no Mr. Tumnus, and Aslan seems to be missing in action as well. Most fantasy series slowly kills off old characters while introducing new ones. This one simply finishes with one cast and starts fresh with a new one. It's to C.S. Lewis's credit as a storyteller that this stunt isn't as fatal as it sounds. There's also a new ruler in Narnia, though he is a false God...er, I mean king. See, Prince Caspian is supposed to be the real ruler of Narnia, but his selfish uncle used his political power to steal the thrown and attempted to kill Caspian.Now Caspian has summoned the Pevensie children to help him reclaim his throne. Looking at these last two paragraphs I wrote I'm sure this must sound terribly dull. Theoretically, wouldn't someone rather watch (and in some cases, read) ""Hamlet"" instead? It's the same basic story, and Shakespear's story is certainly more sophisticated then Lewis's writing is. Well, that may be, but Shakespear never wrote stories with centaurs, eagles, and sword wielding mice either. ""Prince Caspian"" may be a run-of-the-mill ""evil uncle wants power"" story, but very few times does this story provide as much visual fun as this movie does. Even ""The Lion King"" feels subdued compared to this movie.That said, Prince Caspian himself isn't all that interesting of a character, and the battle scenes are starting to feel a little tired by this point. A scene where Narnians must sneak into a castle is filmed with grace, style, and suspense. Less so is a later scene where hoards of soldiers and animals run into each other, killing left and right until you can't even tell who the good guys or bad guys are anymore. One of these days one of these fantasy movies are going to have to address this problem and have the hero accidently kill one of his comrades among the confusion. The villain is also less interesting then the witch from the previous film. The pointy beard and the snare show that he is indeed evil, but that doesn't make him an interesting character that you can sink your teeth into.Arrogant men like this also fail in the end. Likewise the Christian themes are still present, but amidst all the violence and killing, they may be harder to find. This is also the most violent PG rated film in years and borderlines on PG-13, so parents might want to keep that in mind before taking young children to see this. Disney's adaptation of ""The Lion, The Witch, & The Wardrobe"" was a competent film, though fans of the franchise were quick to note that it was basically a remake of the BBC mini-series, only good this time around. On the other hand ""Prince Caspian"" feels very different from the BBC mini-series. The story has been torn down and rebuilt from the ground up, and is now something fans can sink their teeth into. There is now no question as to which is the better version. Finally, though I do believe that books and movies should be separated and not compared, I'm going to make one note to the book huggers out there: Prince Caspian was made older because the producers wanted him to fight in the battles.

650946,A21G7YMX8M7Z4T,B00005JPH2,Kevis Hendrickson,"[11, 14]","It isn't often that a movie adaptation of a book outdoes the source material (I defy anyone to prove that The Lord of the Rings films are superior to the books). However, unlike the novel, which reads like a bad history lesson, Prince Caspian The Movie is a stirring and wonderful fantasy film.Some people might prefer the kinder and gentler prequel, The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe. But the sequel is a much more thrilling movie to watch. There is hardly a moment when there isn't some bit of action taking place on the screen. Where the first Narnia movie welcomed us to a winter wonderland ruled by an evil witch, Prince Caspian takes the story into a darker realm and shows us a Narnia in chaos. The cause? The arrival of human-beings who despise the original inhabitants of Narnia and has waged a war to wipe them completely from existence. In the absence of the original kings and queens of Narnia (the 4 Pevensie children) and the Christ-like Lion, Aslan, Narnia has fallen into ruin and has become a place of darkness where even the mere mention of its original inhabitants can lead to one's imprisonment or death.This is where Prince Caspian comes to the rescue. Desperate to save Narnia from the dark ambitions of his cruel uncle, Miraz, Prince Caspian uses a magic horn to summon the Pevensie children from our world and back to Narnia hoping that they can restore peace to Narnia as they had done once before in the days of the rule of the White Witch.Prince Caspian is a film loaded with epic battle sequences (albeit bloodless) and foregoes some of the first film's gentle qualities to immerse audiences in a Narnia teetering on the brink of absolute lawlessness.I was a little disturbed by the amount of violence in the movie especially considering that this is supposed to be a children's movie. But this seems to be more of a problem with our culture which currently finds itself increasingly marketing inappropriate material to young audiences.The performances by the Pevensie children William Mosley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie Hensley are up to the task. But the stand out performace in the film goes to Peter Dinklage who does a wonderful job endearing audiences as Trumpkin the Dwarf. Also, notable here is newcomer and former stage actor Ben Barnes who plays the role of Prince Caspian.I would recommend this film to all fantasy lovers out there, both young and old. In many respects, this is one of the best children's movies ever made. I would put it up there with the best of them. It's definitely superior to Eragon, The Spiderwick Chronicles, The Seeker, and a number of recently released children's fantasy films. Only Harry Potter and His Dark Materials (if the Golden Compass sequels ever get made)can claim to be a better series. Although a few notable people involved with the first two movies will not appear in any future films, the future is bright for the Narnia series if the filmmakers can continue to produce high quality films like Prince Caspian. I'm already growing antsy waiting on the arrival of the next Narnia entry: ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader""!",5,Much better than the book!!!,1220227200,"09 1, 2008",2008,3121,"[""n't"", 'often', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'book', 'source', 'material', 'defy', 'anyone', 'prove', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'films', 'are', 'superior', 'books', 'However', 'novel', 'bad', 'history', 'lesson', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'Movie', 'stirring', 'wonderful', 'fantasy', 'film.Some', 'people', 'might', 'prefer', 'kinder', 'gentler', 'prequel', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'sequel', 'much', 'more', 'thrilling', 'movie', 'watch', 'hardly', 'moment', 'when', ""n't"", 'bit', 'action', 'taking', 'place', 'screen', 'Where', 'first', 'Narnia', 'movie', 'welcomed', 'winter', 'wonderland', 'ruled', 'evil', 'witch', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'story', 'darker', 'realm', 'Narnia', 'chaos', 'cause', 'arrival', 'human-beings', 'who', 'despise', 'original', 'inhabitants', 'Narnia', 'waged', 'war', 'wipe', 'completely', 'existence', 'absence', 'original', 'kings', 'queens', 'Narnia', '4', 'Pevensie', 'children', 'Christ-like', 'Lion', 'Aslan', 'Narnia', 'fallen', 'ruin', 'become', 'place', 'darkness', 'where', 'even', 'mere', 'mention', 'original', 'inhabitants', 'can', 'lead', 'one', 'imprisonment', 'death.This', 'where', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'rescue', 'Desperate', 'save', 'Narnia', 'dark', 'ambitions', 'cruel', 'uncle', 'Miraz', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'magic', 'horn', 'summon', 'Pevensie', 'children', 'world', 'back', 'Narnia', 'hoping', 'can', 'restore', 'peace', 'Narnia', 'had', 'done', 'once', 'before', 'days', 'rule', 'White', 'Witch.Prince', 'Caspian', 'film', 'loaded', 'epic', 'battle', 'sequences', 'bloodless', 'first', 'film', 'gentle', 'qualities', 'immerse', 'audiences', 'Narnia', 'teetering', 'brink', 'absolute', 'lawlessness.I', 'was', 'little', 'disturbed', 'amount', 'violence', 'movie', 'especially', 'considering', 'supposed', 'be', 'children', 'movie', 'be', 'more', 'problem', 'culture', 'currently', 'increasingly', 'marketing', 'inappropriate', 'material', 'young', 'audiences.The', 'performances', 'Pevensie', 'children', 'William', 'Mosley', 'Anna', 'Popplewell', 'Skandar', 'Keynes', 'Georgie', 'Hensley', 'are', 'up', 'task', 'stand', 'out', 'performace', 'film', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'who', 'wonderful', 'job', 'endearing', 'audiences', 'Trumpkin', 'Dwarf', 'Also', 'notable', 'here', 'newcomer', 'former', 'stage', 'actor', 'Ben', 'Barnes', 'who', 'role', 'Prince', 'Caspian.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'fantasy', 'there', 'young', 'old', 'many', 'respects', 'one', 'best', 'children', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'would', 'put', 'up', 'there', 'best', 'definitely', 'superior', 'Eragon', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'Seeker', 'number', 'recently', 'released', 'children', 'fantasy', 'films', 'Only', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Dark', 'Materials', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'ever', 'get', 'made', 'can', 'claim', 'be', 'better', 'series', 'few', 'notable', 'people', 'involved', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'will', 'not', 'appear', 'future', 'films', 'future', 'bright', 'Narnia', 'series', 'filmmakers', 'can', 'continue', 'produce', 'high', 'quality', 'films', 'Prince', 'Caspian', ""'m"", 'already', 'growing', 'antsy', 'waiting', 'arrival', 'next', 'Narnia', 'entry', 'Voyage', 'Dawn', 'Treader']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian
650947,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005JPH2,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 6]","I've read and heard numerous complaints about ""The Chronicles of Narnia:  Prince Caspian.""  Two of the primary ones are that a) the magic is gone and b) the film is too violent.  For those who've actually read the stories that this film and the previous one are based on, this should come as no surprise.  ""Caspian"" is intentionally a darker, more violent and ""magic-less"" film.  It's a story where the children (except young Lucy for the most part) turn away from the aid of Aslan in an attempt to do things on their own.  Of course, things never go quite right without Aslan.In this tale, we find Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan literally called back to Narnia to help Prince Caspian, the rightful king of the Telmarine empire, reclaim his future throne.  It's been stolen from him by his uncle, Miraz, who plans to become king.  Two great battles, as well as one very dramatic and violent face-off take place, all in an attempt to reclaim the throne.  To tell any more would be to ruin the tale.The story has been edited for pacing, and although it's been a little while since I read this particular tale, I'm sure that one particular battle sequence was added.  There are also a couple of changes to characters that I don't recall in the original story.  In the end though, the key elements of the story are all there.  The Christian undertones are also present, but aren't as obvious as they were in the first film.  Those familiar with the Christian aspects of the story should pick up on them though.Families with especially young children may want to preview this film before taking their little ones.  My daughter, who's seven, had no problem with the story and wasn't scared at all.  Yes, it is grittier, more violent and has less magic in it, but this is a good adaptation of ""Prince Caspian.""  I do believe that the poetic license doesn't add much to the film, but it doesn't take anything away from the key elements of the story.  Overall, it's a highly enjoyable tale that I highly recommend to fans of fantasy, Christians, and anybody who enjoys a good story.",5,A Solid Adaptation,1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,2072,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'heard', 'numerous', 'complaints', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'Two', 'primary', 'ones', 'are', 'magic', 'gone', 'b', 'film', 'too', 'violent', 'who', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'read', 'stories', 'film', 'previous', 'one', 'are', 'based', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'Caspian', 'intentionally', 'darker', 'more', 'violent', 'magic-less', 'film', 'story', 'where', 'children', 'young', 'Lucy', 'most', 'part', 'turn', 'away', 'aid', 'Aslan', 'attempt', 'do', 'things', 'own', 'course', 'things', 'never', 'go', 'quite', 'right', 'Aslan.In', 'tale', 'find', 'Lucy', 'Edmund', 'Peter', 'Susan', 'literally', 'called', 'back', 'Narnia', 'help', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'rightful', 'king', 'Telmarine', 'empire', 'reclaim', 'future', 'throne', 'been', 'stolen', 'uncle', 'Miraz', 'who', 'become', 'king', 'Two', 'great', 'battles', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'very', 'dramatic', 'violent', 'face-off', 'take', 'place', 'attempt', 'reclaim', 'throne', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'ruin', 'tale.The', 'story', 'been', 'edited', 'pacing', 'been', 'little', 'read', 'particular', 'tale', ""'m"", 'sure', 'one', 'particular', 'battle', 'sequence', 'was', 'added', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'changes', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'original', 'story', 'end', 'key', 'elements', 'story', 'are', 'there', 'Christian', 'undertones', 'are', 'also', 'present', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'obvious', 'were', 'first', 'film', 'familiar', 'Christian', 'aspects', 'story', 'should', 'pick', 'up', 'though.Families', 'especially', 'young', 'children', 'may', 'want', 'preview', 'film', 'taking', 'little', 'ones', 'daughter', 'who', 'seven', 'had', 'problem', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'scared', 'Yes', 'grittier', 'more', 'violent', 'less', 'magic', 'good', 'adaptation', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'do', 'believe', 'poetic', 'license', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'key', 'elements', 'story', 'Overall', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'tale', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'fantasy', 'Christians', 'anybody', 'who', 'good', 'story']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

There they meet Prince Caspian of Telmarine (next door to Narnia), who has just escaped his evil uncle's henchmen.  It seems the Telmarines thought Narnia and its inhabitants were gone forever - it has been 1300 (Narnian) years sinceThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.  The Pevensies take up their royal mantels as Kings and Queens of Narnia and vow to help Caspian regain his rightful crown and free the Narnians.At least that's what I think it was about.  Honestly, there are so many Battles To The End, strange characters, and unintelligible accents that I had to content myself with understanding the basics and wishing it would end soon.  I loved the first movie; I thought the Pevensies were adorable, the creatures of Narnia were charming, and Aslan was magnificent, but all that's changed here:  The kids don't get a chance to be kids or interact on a normal level so there's not much opportunity to feel like I knew them.  A (poorly-drawn) CGI badger and a sour-puss dwarf are the main Narnians.  Neither touched me; in fact, the dwarf was off-putting.  And Aslan - ah, I wanted him to be Perfect again and bring me to tears, but, alas, he's also poorly-drawn and we see very little of him.  When we do, it's just not the same.The scenery is breathtakingly gorgeous, but there are just too many intense battles against villains who all look and speak alike (why couldn't they have nice British accents!?)  There's nothing cuddly-cute about Narnia or awesomely divine about Aslan and the kids are reduced to killing machines.

650954,AX2A8Q454K8L2,B00005JPH2,Laura,"[1, 2]","I suppose the biggest surprise most viewers who aren't familiar with the books got was how quickly the story becomes darker and much more serious. But, that's C. S. Lewis's point. Even a beautiful, magical place like Narnia can transform and become a place you barely recognize. Narnia does continue to change each time the children travel to this magical country. They learn, as we do, to expect these drastic changes. You do get to meet wonderful characters like Mr. Tumnus and Reepicheep, (my personal favorite) but you also see a lot of evil too.  Yes, this film was violent. It would have been nice to forewarn parents that this was not a film for younger children. Surprisingly, the film appears to be not rated. I wonder who dropped the ball on this one.But, I suppose the biggest challenge that Andrew Adamson, the director, had to face was that several people had an expectation and picture of Narnia in their minds when they stepped into the theatres. Just as I'm sure readers did when they opened the book Prince Caspian. I wonder if they were similarly outraged. However, if you see how these stories progress you'll see why this plot line really does make sense in the large scheme of things. Think about any sequel in a fantasy series. The Empire Strikes Back, The Two Towers or The Chamber of Secrets. They are all much darker than the original film in the series. But, the sequel sets up the viewers for the rest of the series and prepares you to take a darker journey. Then, when the heroes rise victorious you are more than willing to hail The Return of the King and the Return of the Jedi as major successes.Prince Caspian is part of the journey that the Narnians, the Pevensie children, viewers, and other characters still to come have to go on to reach the ultimate goal. Yes, there were a couple of dramatic licenses taken to further the plot line that drew away from the book. However, I think they did a fine job of developing some of the characters and capturing others. I am however interested in finding out if there's an extended edition that'll be available when it's released on DVD. I wonder if that's where the rest of the character development went. Especially considering the time and care Andrew Adamson typically takes with Narnia. I'd be surprised to hear there won't be one available.I hope you all enjoy this movie, but please understand that Narnia is no longer going to be viewed with rose tinted glasses. There's a reason for this evil presence in Narnia, but I'm afraid you'll have to read the books to find out the answer to that one.",4,A Very Different Narnia,1210982400,"05 17, 2008",2008,2578,"['suppose', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'most', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'books', 'got', 'was', 'how', 'quickly', 'story', 'darker', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'C.', 'S.', 'Lewis', 'point', 'Even', 'beautiful', 'magical', 'place', 'Narnia', 'can', 'transform', 'become', 'place', 'barely', 'recognize', 'Narnia', 'continue', 'change', 'time', 'children', 'travel', 'magical', 'country', 'learn', 'do', 'expect', 'drastic', 'changes', 'do', 'get', 'meet', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'Mr.', 'Tumnus', 'Reepicheep', 'personal', 'favorite', 'also', 'see', 'lot', 'evil', 'too', 'Yes', 'film', 'was', 'violent', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'forewarn', 'parents', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'younger', 'children', 'Surprisingly', 'film', 'be', 'not', 'rated', 'wonder', 'who', 'dropped', 'ball', 'one.But', 'suppose', 'biggest', 'challenge', 'Andrew', 'Adamson', 'director', 'had', 'face', 'was', 'several', 'people', 'had', 'expectation', 'picture', 'Narnia', 'minds', 'when', 'stepped', 'theatres', 'Just', ""'m"", 'sure', 'readers', 'did', 'when', 'opened', 'book', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'wonder', 'were', 'similarly', 'outraged', 'However', 'see', 'how', 'stories', 'progress', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why', 'plot', 'line', 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'large', 'scheme', 'things', 'Think', 'sequel', 'fantasy', 'series', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'Two', 'Towers', 'Chamber', 'Secrets', 'are', 'much', 'darker', 'original', 'film', 'series', 'sequel', 'up', 'viewers', 'rest', 'series', 'take', 'darker', 'journey', 'Then', 'when', 'heroes', 'rise', 'victorious', 'are', 'more', 'willing', 'hail', 'Return', 'King', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'major', 'successes.Prince', 'Caspian', 'part', 'journey', 'Narnians', 'Pevensie', 'children', 'viewers', 'other', 'characters', 'still', 'come', 'have', 'go', 'reach', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'Yes', 'were', 'couple', 'dramatic', 'licenses', 'taken', 'further', 'plot', 'line', 'drew', 'away', 'book', 'However', 'think', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'developing', 'characters', 'capturing', 'others', 'am', 'however', 'interested', 'finding', 'out', 'extended', 'edition', ""'ll"", 'be', 'available', 'when', 'released', 'DVD', 'wonder', 'where', 'rest', 'character', 'development', 'went', 'Especially', 'considering', 'time', 'care', 'Andrew', 'Adamson', 'typically', 'Narnia', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'hear', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'one', 'available.I', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'please', 'understand', 'Narnia', 'no', 'longer', 'going', 'be', 'viewed', 'rose', 'tinted', 'glasses', 'reason', 'evil', 'presence', 'Narnia', ""'m"", 'afraid', ""'ll"", 'have', 'read', 'books', 'find', 'out', 'answer', 'one']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

650956,A2RHV42BTJSVON,B00005JPH2,"Liolania ""In2Jesus""","[1, 3]","First, I would like to say, that having read the books, I came in a little bit narrow-minded, but I try to be very open.  Chronicles of Narnia, for me, is almost worse than watching a Harry Potter movie because I am so familiar with the story and mythology behind the books.In the film, the story begins with a birth, the birth of Prince Caspian's uncle's first son, which means he can kill off Caspian so that his son can have the throne.  Prince Caspian then runs off on horseback and goes into the forest of Narnia where he runs into a badger and two dwarfs, and blows a horn to summon the kings and queens of old.  Of course, we also see Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan as they are going about their daily lives wondering whether or not they will ever go back to Narnia.  It is, just as they are wondering this that they are pulled back into to Narnia.  They soon find that quite some time has passed since they were Kings and Queens in Narnia and things are not as peaceful and pleasant as they were when they left.It is sad to say that this almost seems like a lesser version of Lord of the Rings, but it does.  This does not make it a bad film.  There are many  battle sequences inserted in the movie not originally in the book and feel like they were put in to cash in on Lord of the Rings, but the film still has almost just as much violence as Lord of the Rings.  One of the major things that keeps it from really feeling like its own movie is the fact that they left out a lot of the magical creatures from the book, and brought in Aslan far too late.  Aslan in the book comes in much earlier, and it never fully explained why Peter, Susan, and Edmund couldn't see Aslan at first either.This movie almost could have earned a PG-13 rating because of the adult themes of power struggles within in the family and murder conspiracies.  This is not light stuff, and I would not take anyone under ten to see it, it is quite violent, but there are so many redeeming qualities that I wouldn't throw the baby out with the bath water either.These were the most frustrating points for me, but overall, the film was well-acted, well-filmed, good script, good effects, and was fairly evenly paced.  Part of the problem of filming these books is that in general, not a whole lot goes on.  The books are very casual in tone, and not quite as engrossing as say Harry Potter, but that doesn't mean the story they tale is any less engaging, and the battle sequences and character changes in Peter were totally unnecessary.I do hope that they continue filming these because it would be marvelous to see all seven books filmed. I very much enjoyed seeing the children more grown up, I am glad they came back for the ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" as that is  my favorite book in the series. Next time Disney, cash in more on C.S. Lewis' wonderful world and the quirky characters and fanciful ideas! :DGod Bless ~Amy",4,A Pleasant Distraction,1210896000,"05 16, 2008",2008,2903,"['First', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'having', 'read', 'books', 'came', 'little', 'bit', 'narrow-minded', 'try', 'be', 'very', 'open', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'almost', 'worse', 'watching', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'am', 'so', 'familiar', 'story', 'mythology', 'books.In', 'film', 'story', 'birth', 'birth', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'uncle', 'first', 'son', 'can', 'kill', 'off', 'Caspian', 'son', 'can', 'have', 'throne', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'then', 'off', 'horseback', 'forest', 'Narnia', 'where', 'badger', 'two', 'dwarfs', 'horn', 'summon', 'kings', 'queens', 'old', 'course', 'also', 'see', 'Lucy', 'Edmund', 'Peter', 'Susan', 'are', 'going', 'daily', 'lives', 'wondering', 'not', 'will', 'ever', 'go', 'back', 'Narnia', 'just', 'are', 'wondering', 'are', 'pulled', 'back', 'Narnia', 'soon', 'find', 'quite', 'time', 'passed', 'were', 'Kings', 'Queens', 'Narnia', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'peaceful', 'pleasant', 'were', 'when', 'left.It', 'sad', 'say', 'almost', 'lesser', 'version', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'not', 'make', 'bad', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'battle', 'sequences', 'inserted', 'movie', 'not', 'originally', 'book', 'feel', 'were', 'put', 'cash', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'film', 'still', 'almost', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'violence', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'One', 'major', 'things', 'keeps', 'really', 'feeling', 'own', 'movie', 'fact', 'left', 'out', 'lot', 'magical', 'creatures', 'book', 'brought', 'Aslan', 'far', 'too', 'late', 'Aslan', 'book', 'much', 'earlier', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'why', 'Peter', 'Susan', 'Edmund', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'Aslan', 'first', 'either.This', 'movie', 'almost', 'could', 'have', 'earned', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'adult', 'themes', 'power', 'struggles', 'family', 'murder', 'conspiracies', 'not', 'light', 'stuff', 'would', 'not', 'take', 'anyone', 'ten', 'see', 'quite', 'violent', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'would', ""n't"", 'throw', 'baby', 'bath', 'water', 'were', 'most', 'frustrating', 'points', 'overall', 'film', 'was', 'well-acted', 'well-filmed', 'good', 'script', 'good', 'effects', 'was', 'fairly', 'evenly', 'paced', 'Part', 'problem', 'filming', 'books', 'general', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'books', 'are', 'very', 'casual', 'tone', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'engrossing', 'say', 'Harry', 'Potter', ""n't"", 'mean', 'story', 'tale', 'less', 'engaging', 'battle', 'sequences', 'character', 'changes', 'Peter', 'were', 'totally', 'unnecessary.I', 'do', 'hope', 'continue', 'filming', 'would', 'be', 'marvelous', 'see', 'seven', 'books', 'filmed', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'children', 'more', 'grown', 'up', 'am', 'glad', 'came', 'back', 'Voyage', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'favorite', 'book', 'series', 'Next', 'time', 'Disney', 'cash', 'more', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'wonderful', 'world', 'quirky', 'characters', 'fanciful', 'ideas', 'DGod', 'Bless', '~Amy']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

The wonderful books have been reduced to 'Fantasy for Dummies' here, with production values and acting befitting a late night TV Special.

All of the child actors are absolutely useless. They make Macaulay Culkin look like Peter O'Toole - I'm serious. I'm sure 'deadpan' is a cinematic style and all, but these kids have taken it to a whole new level.Oh yeah, and the talking lion was just ridiculous. Let me see, he does a 'fancy thing' with a river here, and thats supposed to be the films' big highlight? I just don't get the positive reviews for this film.

650967,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B00005JPH2,Mark Baker,"[0, 1]","In the centuries since we were last in Narnia, things have changed.  The Telmarines have overrun the country, sending the real Narnias (you know, the talking animals and mythological creatures) into hiding.  The country is currently under the rule of King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto) until his nephew, Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) is old enough.  But on the night that Miraz's son is born, Caspian flees and goes into hiding.  In great danger, he blows the ancient horn of help.Meanwhile, in our world, only a year has passed for Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie (William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie Henley).  They are waiting for a train when they are suddenly called somewhere else.  At first, they don't realize where they are, but it doesn't take long for them to realize they are once again in Narnia.  Only years have past since their first visit since the castle around them in is ruins.When they learn of the plight of the true Narnias and Caspian, they set out to join forces and free the country.  But with Aslan (voiced again by Liam Neeson) long gone, what can four children and a prince do?Let's get the obvious out of the way first.  They royally changed the story here.  And as someone who has never been fond of this book in the series, I will say that many of the changes were for the better.  They cut much of the first half of the book, which is the slowest part of the story.  They made the battles (yes, they added one) more epic.But not all the changes were beneficial.  The movie felt more like a retread of the first, something I've never felt before.  Peter here is moody and touchy, not the leader he is.  That sub-plot and the theme of faith vs. reason and power are never fully developed but glossed over for the battle sequences.  And let's not forget the romantic sub-plot that felt forced but harmless to me.There is one major change I thought I wouldn't like.  It expands on a scene from the book and sends the characters further down a path of darkness.  Some will find it scary and upsetting, but I think it worked and was one of the better examples of the theme.For anyone disappointed by the battles in the first movie, you'll be happy to hear this one makes up for it.  The battles are epic and gorgeously choreographed.  Couple those with the wonderful special effects we have become spoiled with, and you've got a great feast for the eyes.But I digress.  I was discussing the book versus the movie. I reread parts of the book after I saw the movie.  Yes, they changed the story, but they also include some great lines from the book.  Ultimately, they made a good movie. Even with the changes, the movie never overcomes the fact that the story is essentially straight forward and weak.  But I like this version better than the book.  (Is an avid reader allowed to admit that?)Having made that confession, I will list my biggest disappointment.  Trumpkin the Dwarf (Peter Dinklage) and Reepicheep the Mouse (voiced by Eddie Izzard) are not given enough time to develop here.  What is here is wonderful.  But these two characters are one of the redeeming features of the book for me, so I wanted to see more.Ultimately, I really did enjoy this film.  I was drawn into the world, the characters, and their struggle.  I laughed multiple times and was moved to tears as well. It was a great escape film with some good themes to think about later.",4,A Rare Film Better Than the Book,1228262400,"12 3, 2008",2008,3410,"['centuries', 'were', 'last', 'Narnia', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'Telmarines', 'have', 'overrun', 'country', 'sending', 'real', 'Narnias', 'know', 'talking', 'animals', 'mythological', 'creatures', 'hiding', 'country', 'currently', 'rule', 'King', 'Miraz', 'Sergio', 'Castellitto', 'nephew', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'Ben', 'Barnes', 'old', 'enough', 'night', 'Miraz', 'son', 'born', 'Caspian', 'flees', 'hiding', 'great', 'danger', 'ancient', 'horn', 'help.Meanwhile', 'world', 'only', 'year', 'passed', 'Peter', 'Susan', 'Edmund', 'Lucy', 'Pevensie', 'William', 'Moseley', 'Anna', 'Popplewell', 'Skandar', 'Keynes', 'Georgie', 'Henley', 'are', 'waiting', 'train', 'when', 'are', 'suddenly', 'called', 'somewhere', 'else', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'where', 'are', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'realize', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'Narnia', 'Only', 'years', 'have', 'past', 'first', 'visit', 'castle', 'ruins.When', 'learn', 'plight', 'true', 'Narnias', 'Caspian', 'set', 'out', 'join', 'forces', 'free', 'country', 'Aslan', 'voiced', 'again', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'long', 'gone', 'what', 'can', 'four', 'children', 'prince', 'do', 'Let', 'get', 'obvious', 'way', 'first', 'royally', 'changed', 'story', 'here', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'fond', 'book', 'series', 'will', 'say', 'many', 'changes', 'were', 'better', 'cut', 'much', 'first', 'half', 'book', 'slowest', 'part', 'story', 'made', 'battles', 'yes', 'added', 'one', 'more', 'epic.But', 'not', 'changes', 'were', 'beneficial', 'movie', 'felt', 'more', 'retread', 'first', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'felt', 'Peter', 'here', 'moody', 'touchy', 'not', 'leader', 'sub-plot', 'theme', 'faith', 'vs.', 'reason', 'power', 'are', 'never', 'fully', 'developed', 'glossed', 'battle', 'sequences', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'romantic', 'sub-plot', 'felt', 'forced', 'harmless', 'me.There', 'one', 'major', 'change', 'thought', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'scene', 'book', 'characters', 'further', 'down', 'path', 'darkness', 'will', 'find', 'scary', 'upsetting', 'think', 'worked', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'examples', 'theme.For', 'anyone', 'disappointed', 'battles', 'first', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'hear', 'one', 'up', 'battles', 'are', 'epic', 'gorgeously', 'choreographed', 'Couple', 'wonderful', 'special', 'effects', 'have', 'become', 'spoiled', ""'ve"", 'got', 'great', 'feast', 'eyes.But', 'digress', 'was', 'discussing', 'book', 'movie', 'reread', 'parts', 'book', 'saw', 'movie', 'Yes', 'changed', 'story', 'also', 'include', 'great', 'lines', 'book', 'Ultimately', 'made', 'good', 'movie', 'Even', 'changes', 'movie', 'never', 'fact', 'story', 'essentially', 'straight', 'forward', 'weak', 'like', 'version', 'better', 'book', 'avid', 'reader', 'allowed', 'admit', 'Having', 'made', 'confession', 'will', 'list', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'Trumpkin', 'Dwarf', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'Reepicheep', 'Mouse', 'voiced', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'develop', 'here', 'What', 'here', 'wonderful', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'one', 'redeeming', 'features', 'book', 'so', 'wanted', 'see', 'more.Ultimately', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'was', 'drawn', 'world', 'characters', 'struggle', 'laughed', 'multiple', 'times', 'was', 'moved', 'tears', 'well', 'was', 'great', 'escape', 'film', 'good', 'themes', 'think', 'later']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

650970,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B00005JPH2,Marshall Lord,"[2, 4]","Andrew Adamson and the team who produced ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" have surpassed themselves this time. All four of the actors who played the Pevensie children are brilliant and the film introduces Ben Barnes who is spellbinding as Caspian.If you enjoyed either the original book or the first film you will almost certainly love this adaptation.Apart from the five leads, other excellent performances come from Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan and Eddie Izzard as Reepicheep, the leader of the talking mice - an incredibly difficult role to bring off because he has to be funny in places but also genuinely heroic. (If you've not read the book, imagine a version of Antonio Banderas's character from Shrek II except that where the swordfighting cat is 80% comic and 20% hero, Reepicheep the swordfighting mouse is 80% hero and 20% comic.) Warwick Davis is excellent as the black dwarf Nikabrak and Peter Dinklage is even better as the cynical but golden hearted dwarf Trumpkin.Previous reviewers have posted some excellent descriptions of the film from the viewpoint of a newcomer to Narnia, so I will add a few comments aimed at those who are familiar with the books but have not yet seen the film.Surprisingly, the film managed both to be reasonably true to the spirit of the book and also keep me in suspense, because the way the story was presented kept me thinking the film must be about to diverge from Lewis's plot, though it usually didn't. In fact almost all the major events of the book eventually happened in the film in more or less the same way, along with most of my favourite details of the book, although the order of events is not quite the same.What's missing: Bacchus and his wild girls have been censored, and any schoolteachers cursed with naughty children may be disappointed to learn that the scene where a class of horrid little boys get turned into pigs has been taken out. The Bulgy Bear does get to be one of the Marshals for the duel between Peter and Miraz, but the delightful little exchange when he reminds Peter that he has the right to that position ""I'm a bear, I am!"") didn't make it into the final cut. When Aslan summons the River God, the latter doesn't need any further permission to deal with the Bridge of Beruna. When the DVD comes out I shall be fascinated to see if any of these are in the ""Deleted scenes.""What's been added: this story gives far more details of the battles than the original book, and also to the political manouvering amongst the Telmarines. In the original the initial battle between the forces of Caspian and the Narnians, and those of the Telmarines loyal to Miraz, is passed over in a few lines written in the past tense. In the film a completely different battle which has, however, an equivalent place in the story is shown in gripping detail. The desperate battle which follows the duel is also depicted in much greater detail than in the book.Anna Popplewell's character Susan Pevensie also gets a significantly meatier role than in the book: Queen Susan is not just a formidable archer herself but plays a heroic role commanding the Narnian archers at the Battle of Beruna and she also has what looks like a near romance with Caspian.Having built up Susan's character as much as they have in this film, the producer may have created even more trouble than they would probably already have had in allowing her to drift away from Narnia as recorded in the book ""The Last Battle."" This is probably the most controversial aspect of the seven books although it is not true, as frequently alleged (especially by people who want to denigrate C.S. Lewis) that Susan is excluded from heaven: the reason Susan doesn't meet the other characters in Heaven at the end of the series is that she isn't dead yet. Speaking as an arch-purist where being true to Lewis's original vision is concerned, a more positive role for Susan at the end of the series is one of the few modifications which would not annoy me.Although Peter and Susan are told at the end of ""Prince Caspian"" that they are not coming back to Narnia, William Mosely as High King Peter may get a cameo role at the end of the world (Narnia, not earth) in ""The Last Battle"" and Anna Popplewell will probably have a chance to play Queen Susan again in ""The Horse and his Boy"" which is set during the Golden Age which follows the main action of ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" e.g. the period while the Pevensies are Kings and Queens in Narnia, before they return to Earth at the end of the book.Conclusion: broadly true to the book, gripping and exciting, well worth going to see.

The brothers/sisters are left on their own as they forge an uneasy alliance with Prince Caspian.

650976,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00005JPH2,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[4, 12]","Having disliked the first movie (until pretty much the finale), and own but have never watched the BBC versions, I was kidding myself that I actually wanted to go and see them. But after getting my big book of all seven books in one back after two years (TWO YEARS) I started reading Prince Caspian again - and I read it overnight. I finished it at 9am, I saw the film at 7:30pm. (I've now started reading all the books from the beginning again, although skipping The Lion The Witch & The Wardrobe/The Horse and His Boy as read the first one too many times, and the latter is the worst.)With the book fresh in my mind, it probably wasn't the greatest idea to go right into seeing the movie. My other big mistake was thinking that Andrew Adamson would actually stay faithful to the book. I learnt to read through these books (my dad could NOT do the voices), and have had a love of reading ever since. Quite an accomplishment in this day and age when kids are more interested in hanging about street corners than sitting quietly reading.The books aren't being filmed in chronological order, which I'm not too sad about, considering what comes between TLTWATW and Prince Caspian, The Horse And His Boy. In my opinion, THAHB was the worst book. As long as they film The Silver Chair, The Last Battle - OK, I like the rest of the books. As long as they film all of them, I won't complain. There's really not much need to have The Horse & His Boy inbetween, since all it really does is introduce the Telmarines.The film starts with introducing Caspian, but cutting out most of his back story and only giving us a hint of what is really going on. I instantly realised this film wasn't going to be the film of my childhood imagination, when they did a major bit wrong - Caspian is unconscious when he's rescued by the dwarves, not awake. Then a couple of scenes later, Caspian blows the 'magic' horn. This wasn't even 'seen' in the book, it was only mentioned afterwards.Then we're shot straight back to war torn London, where Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are all waiting to go back to school. Susan gets chatted up - another silly point in the movie.You know what happens after this - if you've actually read the book. I don't mind people who haven't actually read the books, I will quite happily lend it to them - but not if they keep it for two years. But people who talk about the Narnia books, but seem to only talk about TLTWATW - hello there's another six books!!! Grrr.The actors are getting slightly better now into the second movie. They're like the Harry Potter actors - they always suck in the first movie. I still don't like Anna Popplewell as Susan, and she seems to 'blossom' in this movie. From the outrageous flirting with Caspian (they don't even share a scene together in the book until chapter 15) to her figure in the outfit when they're trying to get to Aslan's How - it's rated a PG for a reason love, put them away. That's what I would call a 'wench' in that outfit. The romantic subplot between her and Caspian was really irrelevant- it did not move the storyline forward in the slightest (except to make me cringe) and the heart wrenching scene at the end??? She doesn't even appear again in any more of the books, except albeit briefly. So heart wrenching. She hasn't even had any scenes in the next book yet.Ben Barnes as Caspian was absolutely atrocious. He based his accent on Antonio Banderas, and it was truly awful at points. He was never my favourite character in the books, so thankfully he's only in for two books approximately.Andrew Adamson previously did the Shrek movies, and no doubt there was some influences - if you look at Puss In Boots, and Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard, which I didn't think would work) they're almost the same character. And funnily enough, one's a cat and one's a mouse.There's one big battle in the book. The director obviously thought it would be 'fun' to add in another battle scene, the night raid on the castle, which was unnecessary and to extend the other battle scenes so they not only became tiresome and bored me. Not necessary. Also, the reappearance of the White Witch was merely suggested in the book, and never actually appeared, but she's appears in this for a few minutes.One can only hope that they stick more closely to the books in future films. Or get shot of Andrew Adamson. Maybe I'll have forgotten my anger by the time Voyage Of The Dawn Treader comes out in 2010.

But as they look around them, they realise that this is not the same Narnia of which they remembered. It turns out that over a thousand years have passed and Narnia has been invaded by the Telmarine's, who have pushed the Narnians into extiction and hold over the land with an iron grip. The children are now forced to take back their land, with the aide of the exiled Telmarine Prince Caspian, who seeks the throne from his murderous uncle Miraz.Like many fantasy films, this sequel is darker then the first, with a lot more action and battles then in LWW, which should appease fans who found that the action was skimping. The effects have also improved a lot as well and the addition of such characters as the mouse Reepicheep and Trumpkin the drawf adds some comic relief.While this is a good sequel, I still don't think it exceeds the first film and that although there is a good dose of action, the magic dosen't really feel that present.

The Kings and Queens of Narnia, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, have only been absent from their kingdom for one year in London time. However, when they are suddenly called back to the magical world, they discover that 1,300 years have passed since their reign. The Narnia they knew is now in ruins, and the throne rightfully belongs to the young Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes). Unfortunately, Caspian is on the run from his uncle Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), who is determined to kill his nephew, take the throne for himself, and secure a royal future for his newborn son. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy eventually join forces with Caspian and attempt to reclaim the throne and restore Narnia to what it once was.I enjoyed this movie, but not nearly as much as the first film in the series. Part of the reason for that is because ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" has always been my favorite book in the C.S. Lewis series, so I knew ""Prince Caspian"" wouldn't measure up for me. However, I still think the film itself had some shortcomings. The filmmakers took more liberties with this film than with the last one. Certain things happen out of sequence, and other parts of the film were changed slightly just for the sake of changing them, which really bothers me. Also, the whole Susan/Caspian romance is NOT in the book, and it really pisses me off that Disney felt the need to throw some cheesy love story into the mix of things. (I also hated the sappy, crappy music that played at the end of the film. It was totally out of place. Yuck.)Still, there are a lot of positive things about the movie as well. The battle scenes are fantastic and the special effects are outstanding. Barnes and Castellitto are the stars of this movie, and they deliver very strong performances. Eddie Izzard provided the voice for Reepicheep the mouse, which was a pleasant surprise. One of my favorite scenes in the film is the one where the White Witch returns for a few minutes, and Tilda Swinton appears in a brief cameo. Liam Neeson also returns to provide the voice of Aslan, but the lion is absent from most of the film, and I remember him being present in the book a bit more...why in the world would they cut Aslan's scenes from the film?! He's the best part of the whole story!All things considered, ""Prince Caspian"" is a good movie, but it lacks some of the magic from the first ""Narnia"" film.

650980,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B00005JPH2,Mel Odom,"[2, 4]","THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA:  PRINCE CASPIAN hit theaters with a lot of expectation.  The book series has been popular since they were first published nearly fifty years ago, and they've never gone out of print.  Earlier movie versions, animated and live-action, have been made of them.  But after the success of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA:  THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, fans hoped for more and Hollywood banked on another success.I had a good time with the first movie.  Taking my son with me enhanced the experience, though.  His innocent glee stripped years away from me and eased me right back into my own childhood.  The sights and sounds of the world were amazing, as they would have to be in order to grab the audiences lying out there in wait now.  And the pacing of the movie was well done.However, Narnia purists are going to have a problem with this version of the novel.  Hollywood has strayed far from the path in making this sequel.  Yes, it's true, Narnia has been Hollywoodized and given the big box office treatment.  Which means that more has been left out of the book than was kept in, and even more new material was shoveled into the story.  In fact, a whole rivalry sequence between Caspian (Ben Barnes) and Peter (William Moseley) has been tossed into the mix, as well as Susan (Anna Popplewell) ""crushing"" on Caspian.Also, the battle scenes are definitely more hardcore than they are in the book.  And protracted.  The novel dealt with them in a straight-forward manner and moved into the characters and the spirituality of the book.But I have to give Hollywood its due.  I'd wager most of the people buying tickets haven't ever read the books, just as they hadn't read THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  They're there packing the seats because they want to see adventure, excitement, and royal battles between good and evil.I'd even read PRINCE CASPIAN to my son shortly after we watched THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE.  We'd read that book before the movie and he knew everything that was going to happen.  He kept throwing hints to his mom during the movie.  This time he really believed we hadn't read the book because so much was different.Hollywood chose to change the story, and I accepted that within a few minutes and simply enjoyed what was on the screen without proprietary interest.  The special effects are awesome, the mythical beings are amazing, and the landscape is lush and incredible.  My son was bowled over as Narnia once again unfolded before us.  I have to admit, I was too.Despite the differences in character and motivations, and the way the final battle was staged when Peter undertook single combat against Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), I had a great time.  Susan stepped into the battles and became an amazing warrior (okay, I had to swallow hard at that one when I saw her first shooting men with her bow then using it as a staff to battle again in the thick of the fighting while wearing no armor).  Peter was even more courageous than before, and naturally stepped into a leadership role.  Edmund (Skandar Keynes) was a fierce fighter as well, and the young actor has certainly grown into the role.  There is a fantastic scene where Lucy (Georgie Henley) blocks the retreating Telmarin army that had the audience laughing and cheering at the same time.  The kids have changed.The assault on the castle at night was terrific.  My son and I sat on the edges of our seat and watched as the battle progressed and finally turned deadly.  And when Aslan (Liam Neeson) stepped onto the screen, we were in Narnia fighting the good fight at the sides of the Narnians.Maybe this isn't a faithful interpretation of the original novel, but you're not going to be able to find a much better early summer offering.  I question the rating a little, because I would have bumped it up a notch due to all the physical action, the evil intent, and the PG rating isn't warning enough.With all the fantasy and superhero movies hitting the screens this summer, finding one that stands out head and shoulders above the others is going to be hard.  I've decided not to stress over figuring out which one is the best, and instead concentrate on enjoying the feast!",5,Prince Caspian Is An Action Delight!,1211500800,"05 23, 2008",2008,4192,"['CHRONICLES', 'OF', 'NARNIA', 'PRINCE', 'CASPIAN', 'hit', 'theaters', 'lot', 'expectation', 'book', 'series', 'been', 'popular', 'were', 'first', 'published', 'nearly', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', ""'ve"", 'never', 'gone', 'print', 'Earlier', 'movie', 'versions', 'animated', 'live-action', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'success', 'THE', 'CHRONICLES', 'OF', 'NARNIA', 'LION', 'THE', 'WITCH', 'AND', 'THE', 'WARDROBE', 'fans', 'hoped', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'banked', 'success.I', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'first', 'movie', 'Taking', 'son', 'enhanced', 'experience', 'though', 'innocent', 'glee', 'stripped', 'years', 'away', 'eased', 'right', 'back', 'own', 'childhood', 'sights', 'sounds', 'world', 'were', 'amazing', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'order', 'grab', 'audiences', 'lying', 'out', 'there', 'wait', 'now', 'pacing', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'done.However', 'Narnia', 'purists', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'problem', 'version', 'novel', 'Hollywood', 'strayed', 'far', 'path', 'making', 'sequel', 'Yes', 'true', 'Narnia', 'been', 'Hollywoodized', 'given', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'treatment', 'Which', 'more', 'been', 'left', 'book', 'was', 'kept', 'even', 'more', 'new', 'material', 'was', 'shoveled', 'story', 'fact', 'whole', 'rivalry', 'sequence', 'Caspian', 'Ben', 'Barnes', 'Peter', 'William', 'Moseley', 'been', 'tossed', 'mix', 'as', 'well', 'Susan', 'Anna', 'Popplewell', 'crushing', 'Caspian.Also', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'definitely', 'more', 'hardcore', 'are', 'book', 'protracted', 'novel', 'dealt', 'straight-forward', 'manner', 'moved', 'characters', 'spirituality', 'book.But', 'have', 'give', 'Hollywood', 'due', ""'d"", 'wager', 'most', 'people', 'buying', 'tickets', 'have', ""n't"", 'ever', 'read', 'books', 'just', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'THE', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', ""'re"", 'packing', 'seats', 'want', 'see', 'adventure', 'excitement', 'royal', 'battles', 'good', 'evil.I', ""'d"", 'even', 'read', 'PRINCE', 'CASPIAN', 'son', 'shortly', 'watched', 'LION', 'THE', 'WITCH', 'AND', 'THE', 'WARDROBE', ""'d"", 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'knew', 'everything', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'kept', 'throwing', 'hints', 'mom', 'movie', 'time', 'really', 'believed', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'different.Hollywood', 'chose', 'change', 'story', 'accepted', 'few', 'minutes', 'simply', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'was', 'screen', 'proprietary', 'interest', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'awesome', 'mythical', 'beings', 'are', 'amazing', 'landscape', 'lush', 'incredible', 'son', 'was', 'bowled', 'over', 'Narnia', 'once', 'again', 'unfolded', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'too.Despite', 'differences', 'character', 'motivations', 'way', 'final', 'battle', 'was', 'staged', 'when', 'Peter', 'undertook', 'single', 'combat', 'Miraz', 'Sergio', 'Castellitto', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'Susan', 'stepped', 'battles', 'became', 'amazing', 'warrior', 'okay', 'had', 'swallow', 'hard', 'one', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'shooting', 'men', 'bow', 'then', 'using', 'staff', 'battle', 'again', 'thick', 'fighting', 'wearing', 'armor', 'Peter', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'courageous', 'before', 'naturally', 'stepped', 'leadership', 'role', 'Edmund', 'Skandar', 'Keynes', 'was', 'fierce', 'fighter', 'as', 'well', 'young', 'actor', 'certainly', 'grown', 'role', 'fantastic', 'scene', 'where', 'Lucy', 'Georgie', 'Henley', 'retreating', 'Telmarin', 'army', 'had', 'audience', 'laughing', 'cheering', 'same', 'time', 'kids', 'have', 'changed.The', 'assault', 'castle', 'night', 'was', 'terrific', 'son', 'sat', 'edges', 'seat', 'watched', 'battle', 'progressed', 'finally', 'turned', 'deadly', 'when', 'Aslan', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'stepped', 'screen', 'were', 'Narnia', 'fighting', 'good', 'fight', 'sides', 'Narnians.Maybe', ""n't"", 'faithful', 'interpretation', 'original', 'novel', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'much', 'better', 'early', 'summer', 'offering', 'question', 'rating', 'little', 'would', 'have', 'bumped', 'up', 'notch', 'due', 'physical', 'action', 'evil', 'intent', 'PG', 'rating', ""n't"", 'warning', 'enough.With', 'fantasy', 'superhero', 'movies', 'hitting', 'screens', 'summer', 'finding', 'one', 'out', 'head', 'shoulders', 'others', 'going', 'be', 'hard', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'not', 'stress', 'figuring', 'out', 'one', 'best', 'instead', 'concentrate', 'enjoying', 'feast']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

This movie has neither the wonder of Narnia found in LLW nor the adventure of VOTDT. This movie is lacking the quality of story the other Narnia movies provide. It gets off to an okay start and has a decent ending. But too much of this movie seems to consist of incoherent battle scenes. Action and battle seem to take over at expense of story in large parts of this movie. The battle scenes don't dominate the book in the same way the do in the movie. The castle raid was NOT in the book and was not needed. That part particularly helped the battle aspect of this film to be overdone.  The book offers MUCH more depth of story,espeically with more development  regard to the children figuring out they have returned to Cair Paravel hundreds of years later and the history of Caspian. I also could have done without the suggested romances in the movie,however brief they might have been. While the visual work on this movie is good,and I enjoyed ""The call"" enough to purchase an MP# version of the song,overall this movie disappointed me. Then there's the tension between Peter and Caspian,which is totally out of line as there is NONE of it in the book. In the book Peter and Caspian always got along fine. Moreover,Peter's character is totally butchered in this movie. The Peter from the book is strong,humble,acts like a high king should,and avoids rashness. The Peter in the movie is a jerk,is too whiny,shows arrogance at times,and makes some rash decisions. It's horrible to see such a major character portrayed so out of character.

650987,A2LHZW8NRJFQSM,B00005JPH2,Michelle,"[0, 0]","Okay, this movie really splits me in two. I adore the books that these movies are based off of. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe followed the book beautifully, this one does not. It makes several deviations and the time line is quite... wibbly. They've added a romance between Susan and Caspian which I personally find annoying because I adore the wife he gets in the next book.Having said that, this movie also does a brilliant job capturing the new changed Edmund. He's always been my favorite character, and honestly, he's the only one that translates properly. The scene where Edmund brings the challenge to Miraz was excellent, and the scene where Edmund crashes the White Witch's plans is also great (even if I hated that they were allowing Peter to be seduced by her plans.)This movie's greatest failing, in my opinion, is what they did to King Peter character. They made him value his own pride over the safety and future of Narnia. That made changing the initial story necessary. That is where the problems all arise. If you are an avid fan of the book, this movie will make you upset. It has some lovely moments, but the overall feel of it leaves you wanting something more. The brilliance of the original story is missing.Non book fans will find a enjoyable movie. If you enjoyed the first one give this one a go. Do not expect it to follow the book as closely as the other one. Still, it has some moments making it worth while.The minor characters are nicely covered.

In this, much of our beloved characters have returned along with a few new faces as well.After being away for awhile, the Pevensie children find themselves being whisked back to Narnia and dumped on to what once was their home.  Realizing that it is hundreds of years later, they wonder why they have been brought back.  When they rescue a dwarf and learn that a Prince is trying to free the Narnians from years of oppression they know they have to help.  But Aslan isn't around to help as much this time, and their foe seems unbeatable.Characters:William Moseley: Peter PevensieAnna Popplewell: Susan PevensieSkandar Keynes: Edmund PevensieGeorgie Henley: Lucy PevensieBen Barnes: Prince CaspianLiam Neeson: AslanOnce again all of the characters were well cast and I was glad the original characters came back for this sequel (and subsequent ones).  The continuity always helps in a series.  Peter was kind of annoying in this movie, but I think he was supposed to have some strife so I guess that explains the motivations. Lucy was still as wonderful as ever and it was amazing to see how Georgie Henley grew up.  I liked the addition of Reepicheep as well as he is always amusing in his daring mousy ways.This movie mostly stuck close to the book.  There wasn't too much changed anyway.  All the main aspects of the book were included, such as the Uncle's deviousness and Prince Caspian's will to fight for the Narnians.  I do have to complain about the amount of battle scenes in this movie.  Maybe some people enjoy it, but for being an exciting clash of war, I actually got bored with it because it went on so long.  It jus seemed like more was devoted to the battle scenes than to the actual storyline itself.  So much could have been added that wasn't.The special effects, once again, were tremendous in this movie.  The centaurs and other creatures came to life.  The music too was wonderful as usual.  Still hauntingly beautiful and completely fitting to the tone of Narnia.It still wasn't a terrible movie.  Quite good when you think about book to movie's that have come before.  If you enjoyed the first, you'll surely enjoy this movie.Review by M.

650998,A36RS3ZMNE9JSQ,B00005JPH2,Negative Comments,"[3, 7]","And this movie is a great example why. I lucked out with the firstChroniclesmovie, it was good enough that I gave it a 7/10. It did everything that a movie like that should do, without any major mistakes. This sequel however lacks everything that made the first one good. It has no human element. It literally feels like they just went through the motions and decided to make a fantasy movie for kids, with no regard for script revision, character development, meaningful dialogue, etc. It's a BASIC kids movie, which means nothing truly has to be fleshed out. This approach will ALWAYS result in a fundamentally bad movie.**All the charm from the first movie was gone, and other than Lucy, these characters just aren't likable very much at all. The girl playing Lucy did a great job here like last time though, I hope she gets many more roles.**What's up with the constant, sweeping, forced, emotional music?**Edmund and Susan felt like role players. They got lost amidst the shuffle of all these characters. It got to the point where I was consciously watching to see what lines they would speak next. And those lines mostly consisted of soulless, interchangeable lines that could've been spoken by one of the bears or cheetahs for all we care.**I really hate to compare it with the Lord of the Rings movies, but it's really hard not to do when you have walking trees going into battle, a water creature summoned to wash away bad guys on horseback, and bow and arrow tricks being performed which doesn't involve actually shooting the arrow..**Susan's kiss to Caspian at the end goes in my book as one the most contrived kisses I've seen in awhile. There was nothing that happened for her to even develop these feelings. From what I can recall, there was no more than one or two times that they even specifically looked at each other. And during the times they did that (looked at each other), I was actually praising the movie that they didn't overdo it with these forced exchanges where the girl shyly looks at the handsome hero, with just a hint of a smile on her face, as she then walks away as the hero searchingly gazes at her, with a wondering, thoughtful look on his face, before the scene fades to the next. I was glad they DIDN'T go this route and kept it subtle. Well so much for that; she ends up randomly KISSING him on the mouth at the end. Contrary to what movies may have you believe, this NEVER happens. Ever. No girl does that. Think about it from a real life perspective, this would be the equivalent of you helping a female friend unpack her things after a move, during which time her female roommate is also there (which sets the scenario for you sort of knowing this other girl), and then after all the unpacking is done, the roommate comes up to you and just plants one on your mouth. How realistic does that sound? Bottom line: no girl walks up to a random guy and just kisses him on the lips. This whole clich&eacute;d romance angle hurt this movie's credibility even more.**I haven't seen a forced romance this...forced, since Winona Ryder inexplicably fell in love with Edward Scissorhands after she saw him on TV and he said he would ""do anything for her.""",2,there's a reason why I avoid fantasy movies,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,3185,"['movie', 'great', 'example', 'why', 'lucked', 'out', 'firstChroniclesmovie', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'gave', '7/10', 'did', 'everything', 'movie', 'should', 'do', 'major', 'mistakes', 'sequel', 'however', 'everything', 'made', 'first', 'one', 'good', 'human', 'element', 'literally', 'just', 'went', 'motions', 'decided', 'make', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'kids', 'regard', 'script', 'revision', 'character', 'development', 'meaningful', 'dialogue', 'etc', 'BASIC', 'kids', 'movie', 'nothing', 'truly', 'be', 'fleshed', 'out', 'approach', 'will', 'ALWAYS', 'result', 'fundamentally', 'bad', 'movie', '**All', 'charm', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'gone', 'other', 'Lucy', 'characters', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'likable', 'very', 'much', 'girl', 'playing', 'Lucy', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'last', 'time', 'hope', 'many', 'more', 'roles', '**What', 'up', 'constant', 'sweeping', 'forced', 'emotional', 'music', '**Edmund', 'Susan', 'felt', 'like', 'role', 'players', 'got', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'characters', 'got', 'point', 'where', 'was', 'consciously', 'watching', 'see', 'what', 'lines', 'would', 'speak', 'next', 'lines', 'mostly', 'consisted', 'soulless', 'interchangeable', 'lines', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'spoken', 'one', 'bears', 'cheetahs', 'care', 'really', 'hate', 'compare', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'movies', 'really', 'hard', 'not', 'do', 'when', 'have', 'walking', 'trees', 'going', 'battle', 'water', 'creature', 'summoned', 'wash', 'away', 'bad', 'guys', 'horseback', 'bow', 'arrow', 'tricks', 'being', 'performed', ""n't"", 'involve', 'actually', 'shooting', 'arrow..**Susan', 'kiss', 'Caspian', 'end', 'book', 'one', 'most', 'contrived', 'kisses', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'awhile', 'was', 'nothing', 'happened', 'even', 'develop', 'feelings', 'what', 'can', 'recall', 'was', 'more', 'one', 'two', 'times', 'even', 'specifically', 'looked', 'other', 'times', 'did', 'looked', 'other', 'was', 'actually', 'praising', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'overdo', 'forced', 'exchanges', 'where', 'girl', 'shyly', 'handsome', 'hero', 'just', 'hint', 'smile', 'face', 'then', 'away', 'hero', 'searchingly', 'wondering', 'thoughtful', 'look', 'face', 'scene', 'next', 'was', 'glad', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'go', 'route', 'kept', 'subtle', 'Well', 'so', 'much', 'up', 'randomly', 'KISSING', 'mouth', 'end', 'Contrary', 'what', 'movies', 'may', 'have', 'believe', 'NEVER', 'Ever', 'girl', 'Think', 'real', 'life', 'perspective', 'would', 'be', 'equivalent', 'helping', 'female', 'friend', 'things', 'move', 'time', 'female', 'roommate', 'also', 'scenario', 'sort', 'knowing', 'other', 'girl', 'then', 'unpacking', 'done', 'roommate', 'up', 'just', 'plants', 'one', 'mouth', 'How', 'realistic', 'sound', 'Bottom', 'line', 'girl', 'up', 'random', 'guy', 'just', 'kisses', 'lips', 'whole', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'romance', 'angle', 'hurt', 'movie', 'credibility', 'even', 'more', '**I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'forced', 'romance', 'forced', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'inexplicably', 'fell', 'love', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'saw', 'TV', 'said', 'would', 'do', 'anything']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

The movie begins with young Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) being driven from his kingdom by his evil uncle, who kills Caspian's father to take over as king.As Caspian flees, he stumbles upon the land of Narnia and blows the horn that sounds the call for the Pevensie siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, along with the mighty Aslan.  Along with their new hero, the four siblings return to the enchanted land of Narnia full of mystical creatures and character-filled natural elements.  They stir up the Narnians to enage the evil king and restore Prince Caspian to his throne.The C.S. Lewis realm of fantasy and adventure continues in the second installment of the Narnia series.  The imagination, character, and charm of his writing combined with the ""Magical World"" of Disney creates an epic masterpiece sure to appeal to families.  The movie is a bit rough at times for little kids (thus the PG-rating) but ultimately it is pretty family-friendly.I thoroughly enjoyed watching Prince Caspian.  C.S.

Keller ""Packerfan75""","[1, 2]","I just finished watching Prince Caspian for the second time and enjoyed it just about as much as the first as the dvd doesn't disappoint.Prince Caspian picks up many years after the events of the first Narnia and many things have changed indeed. Humans have taken over Narnia and run off all the creatures and magical beings, leaving the land in a darkened and dreary state. Prince Caspian is heir to the throne but is threatened by his uncle who has been coveting it for himself and his newborn son. Caspian must flee to the forest to save any hope for his future rule and the Narnian's whom he's only thought to be myths and legends up until now. The children from the first Narnia are somewhat accidentally but fortunately summoned back to a very different land than they left which is in desperate need of their help. Conflict ensues between all these characters who are all at once thrown together but eventually find a common ground against a common foe. Can the Prince survive to take hold of his royal birthright? What of the returning kings and queens of old, where will they fit in to this land that used to be their own? Will Alsan the Lion return to help save what's left of the few remaining Narnian's and help them gain their stolen freedom?It's a much more mature and serious film than the first one. I still like The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, but Prince Caspian does what a sequel should by upping the ante and increasing the intesity. I was very suprised at the overall dark and bleak tone of the film. You really get a sense of gloom that's darkened what used to be a vibrant and colorful Narnia. I thought all the characters and voice acting was excellent. Nothing about this felt childish or remedial. This one works on all levels and makes for a perfect family movie as it has something for everyone without straying too far in one directon or the other. A perfect balance is struck for everyone to find something they like. We're introduced to many new characters but we're not overwhelmed where we have to try to keep up so as to not get lost later in the film. That seems to be something that many films have fumbled with but Prince Caspian is easy to follow and the story stays focused. There are many wonderful action and battle scenes that toe the line perfectly as they're serious but not gruesome or gory. The landscapes are gorgeous as they're all shot on location and the CGI characters blend in well, are very detailed but not distracting. Prince Caspian accomplished something that many films can't or don't bother to by taking us to a beautiful far away land that'll stick with you and make you want to go back after it's ended. That's a real testament in movie making. I had a great time in Narnia and look forward to going back again.There are a few things here and there that you could nit pick at if you wanted to but you'd only ruin a good time for yourself. Besides, it's a fantasy film so it should be allowed some more liberties than most movie genres. I had to remind myself of that when I caught a few things that stretched reality, but then I told my brain to shut up and just enjoy it and I did.The video on the disc is clean and clear of any specks or dirt. The day scenes are bright and colorful and the night scenes were fairly dark but not to the point where I found it difficult at all to keep up with what was going on. You can turn the lights down without turning them off and be fine. There are quite a few of the night scenes so it's good they were'nt nearly as bad as I've seen on alot of films. The detail was ok, if a little soft at times but everything was discernable. They could've probably done better but what's here is just fine. The DD 5.1 mix is excellent. The speech, orchestral score and sound effects were perfectly balanced and very involving. The action scenes never got too loud to where you felt you needed to turn it down, nor the quiet talking to where you needed to turn it up. There are also some great sound effects from wind, leaves, water, creature noises and the clashing and clanging of armored battle. I also picked up some discrete rumbling and low bass during calmer moments that caught me off guard but were a nice suprise.Prince Caspian is a very well done movie for all ages and all I can think is what a good thing that is. In these days of raunchy comedies, swear filled action movies, gory horror movies and sex scenes in just about everything, it's refreshing to see an innocent and well done live action(mostly) movie for the whole family to be able to sit and enjoy together. I hope more movie studios catch on to this and give families more reasons to go back to the movies together. Don't miss this one.",4,A Good Disc For a Good Sequel,1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,4708,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'second', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'first', 'dvd', ""n't"", 'disappoint.Prince', 'Caspian', 'picks', 'up', 'many', 'years', 'events', 'first', 'Narnia', 'many', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'indeed', 'Humans', 'have', 'taken', 'over', 'Narnia', 'run', 'off', 'creatures', 'magical', 'beings', 'leaving', 'land', 'darkened', 'dreary', 'state', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'heir', 'throne', 'threatened', 'uncle', 'who', 'been', 'coveting', 'newborn', 'son', 'Caspian', 'must', 'flee', 'forest', 'save', 'hope', 'future', 'rule', 'Narnian', 'whom', 'only', 'thought', 'be', 'myths', 'up', 'now', 'children', 'first', 'Narnia', 'are', 'somewhat', 'accidentally', 'fortunately', 'summoned', 'back', 'very', 'different', 'land', 'left', 'desperate', 'need', 'help', 'Conflict', 'ensues', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'once', 'thrown', 'together', 'eventually', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'common', 'foe', 'Can', 'Prince', 'survive', 'take', 'hold', 'royal', 'birthright', 'What', 'returning', 'kings', 'queens', 'old', 'where', 'will', 'fit', 'land', 'used', 'be', 'own', 'Will', 'Alsan', 'Lion', 'return', 'help', 'save', 'what', 'left', 'few', 'remaining', 'Narnian', 'help', 'gain', 'stolen', 'freedom', 'much', 'more', 'mature', 'serious', 'film', 'first', 'one', 'still', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'what', 'sequel', 'should', 'upping', 'ante', 'increasing', 'intesity', 'was', 'very', 'suprised', 'overall', 'dark', 'bleak', 'tone', 'film', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'gloom', 'darkened', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'vibrant', 'colorful', 'Narnia', 'thought', 'characters', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'Nothing', 'felt', 'childish', 'remedial', 'one', 'levels', 'perfect', 'family', 'movie', 'something', 'everyone', 'straying', 'too', 'far', 'one', 'directon', 'other', 'perfect', 'balance', 'struck', 'everyone', 'find', 'something', 'like', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'many', 'new', 'characters', ""'re"", 'not', 'overwhelmed', 'where', 'have', 'try', 'keep', 'up', 'so', 'not', 'get', 'lost', 'later', 'film', 'be', 'something', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'fumbled', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'easy', 'follow', 'story', 'stays', 'focused', 'are', 'many', 'wonderful', 'action', 'battle', 'scenes', 'toe', 'line', 'perfectly', ""'re"", 'serious', 'not', 'gruesome', 'gory', 'landscapes', 'are', 'gorgeous', ""'re"", 'shot', 'location', 'CGI', 'characters', 'blend', 'well', 'are', 'very', 'detailed', 'not', 'distracting', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'accomplished', 'something', 'many', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'taking', 'beautiful', 'far', 'away', 'land', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'ended', 'real', 'testament', 'movie', 'making', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'Narnia', 'look', 'forward', 'going', 'back', 'again.There', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'here', 'there', 'could', 'nit', 'pick', 'wanted', ""'d"", 'only', 'ruin', 'good', 'time', 'fantasy', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'more', 'liberties', 'most', 'movie', 'genres', 'had', 'remind', 'when', 'caught', 'few', 'things', 'stretched', 'reality', 'then', 'told', 'brain', 'shut', 'up', 'just', 'enjoy', 'did.The', 'video', 'disc', 'clean', 'clear', 'specks', 'dirt', 'day', 'scenes', 'are', 'bright', 'colorful', 'night', 'scenes', 'were', 'fairly', 'dark', 'not', 'point', 'where', 'found', 'difficult', 'keep', 'up', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'can', 'turn', 'lights', 'down', 'turning', 'off', 'be', 'fine', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'night', 'scenes', 'good', ""were'nt"", 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'alot', 'films', 'detail', 'was', 'ok', 'little', 'soft', 'times', 'everything', 'was', 'discernable', 'could', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'done', 'better', 'what', 'here', 'just', 'fine', 'DD', '5.1', 'mix', 'excellent', 'speech', 'orchestral', 'score', 'sound', 'effects', 'were', 'perfectly', 'balanced', 'very', 'involving', 'action', 'never', 'got', 'too', 'loud', 'where', 'felt', 'needed', 'turn', 'down', 'quiet', 'talking', 'where', 'needed', 'turn', 'up', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'sound', 'effects', 'wind', 'water', 'creature', 'noises', 'clashing', 'clanging', 'armored', 'battle', 'also', 'picked', 'up', 'discrete', 'rumbling', 'low', 'bass', 'calmer', 'moments', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'were', 'nice', 'suprise.Prince', 'Caspian', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'ages', 'can', 'think', 'what', 'good', 'thing', 'days', 'raunchy', 'comedies', 'swear', 'filled', 'action', 'movies', 'gory', 'horror', 'movies', 'sex', 'scenes', 'just', 'everything', 'refreshing', 'see', 'innocent', 'well', 'done', 'live', 'action', 'mostly', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'be', 'able', 'sit', 'enjoy', 'together', 'hope', 'more', 'movie', 'studios', 'catch', 'give', 'families', 'more', 'reasons', 'go', 'back', 'movies', 'together', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian
651008,A1G3TFQRYJRTAU,B00005JPH2,"Phillip Dacus ""Meeds Met""","[1, 2]","I was puzzled on this movie as to what rating to give it. On the plus side, it has a wonderful insight into the nature of God. The reason that we dont often see God is that we are not looking for Him or we are just not looking in the right places. In the movie, the Characters did not see Aslan, but that was because they were not looking for him. Only Lucy was able to find Aslan because she wanted to see him.The other excellent point the movie made was that we need to wait on God. King Peter made the mistake of not waiting on Aslan. He made a bad military move that cost him a lot.It was just a little too predictable for me. For example: Prince Caspian found out that his father was killed by Miraz and he wanted revenge. This is used way too much in movies. Cant we be a little creative here? Images of the Princess Bride filled my head. ""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die.""Another odd thing to me was that in the 1st one, the children were only used when they were not in Narnia. Once they went into Narnia, they were quite a bit older. This enabled them to have the strength to weild weapons, and the knowledge and wisdom to rule a kingdom.In this second installment, they remain children throughout and we are offered no explanation on this. Was this because we were to draw the conclusion that where we are weak, God is strong? Or was it that the older versions of the children were not available for the shooting of the film?This one was way better than the first. Not even a comparrison. The first one was a kids movie, but in this one, The Lion Witch and Wardrobe grew up. But the movie as a whole did not work well for me.I will not be sad if another is not made.",4,"Good insight into God, but movie could have been better",1231891200,"01 14, 2009",2009,1714,"['was', 'puzzled', 'movie', 'what', 'rating', 'give', 'plus', 'side', 'wonderful', 'insight', 'nature', 'God', 'reason', 'dont', 'often', 'see', 'God', 'are', 'not', 'looking', 'Him', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'looking', 'right', 'places', 'movie', 'Characters', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'Aslan', 'was', 'were', 'not', 'looking', 'Only', 'Lucy', 'was', 'able', 'find', 'Aslan', 'wanted', 'see', 'him.The', 'other', 'excellent', 'point', 'movie', 'made', 'was', 'need', 'wait', 'God', 'King', 'Peter', 'made', 'mistake', 'not', 'waiting', 'Aslan', 'made', 'bad', 'military', 'move', 'cost', 'lot.It', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'predictable', 'example', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'found', 'out', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'Miraz', 'wanted', 'revenge', 'used', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'movies', 'Cant', 'be', 'little', 'creative', 'here', 'Images', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'filled', 'head', 'Hello', 'name', 'Inigo', 'Montoya', 'killed', 'father', 'prepare', 'die', 'odd', 'thing', 'was', '1st', 'one', 'children', 'were', 'only', 'used', 'when', 'were', 'not', 'Narnia', 'went', 'Narnia', 'were', 'quite', 'bit', 'older', 'enabled', 'have', 'strength', 'weild', 'weapons', 'knowledge', 'wisdom', 'rule', 'kingdom.In', 'second', 'installment', 'remain', 'children', 'are', 'offered', 'explanation', 'Was', 'were', 'draw', 'conclusion', 'where', 'are', 'weak', 'God', 'strong', 'was', 'older', 'versions', 'children', 'were', 'not', 'available', 'shooting', 'film', 'one', 'was', 'way', 'better', 'first', 'Not', 'even', 'comparrison', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'kids', 'movie', 'one', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'grew', 'up', 'movie', 'whole', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'well', 'me.I', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'sad', 'not', 'made']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

651010,A3OYZPXTFH5IEI,B00005JPH2,Prince Caspian XI,"[0, 0]","Before I list the abominable crimes of Andrew Adamson, AKA Mr. Director, I'll list the good things and improvements of this movie, over the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. First the actors were great! Trumpkin was just as I pictured him, grouchy, yet lovable. And Skandar Keyens, Georgie Henly, and Warwick Davis as Edmund, Lucy, and Nikabrik were very good. The computer animation improved, though Aslan seemed less realistic than in LWW. Miraz was vicious and the Battle at the end of the movie was nothing short of spectacular. Now that is out of the way, here's the bad stuff... The movie was a departure from the book from the very start. Cornelius woke Caspian up and instead of asking him up to the great tower, he made him get ready to retreat. I'm of course not even mentioning that at least 2-3 chapters of the book were totally left out. And by the way Peter didn't get into a fight and the Pevensies didn't land on the beach, they landed in the forest. The apple orchard scene disappeared, oh I mean it almost was, they deleted that scene. Instead of gradually grasping that the ruins they were standing on were Cair Paravel they instantly get it. Because seeing the ruins of a castle you once ruled is an everyday occurrence. When Caspian wakes up, it's not to the kind, furry face of Trufflehunter, but to the old badger and Nikabrik arguing whether to keep him or not. And yes, I didn't mention Trumpkin because he had already been taken by the Telmarines. All of the interesting dialogue with Caspian meeting all the friendly Narnians blew away into deleted-out-of-the-movie-land. Shame on you, Adamson! And who wouldn't like The three Bulgy Bears or Pattertwig? Before Caspian gets to the how, there is a scene at the fern forest. This led to Caspian meeting Reepicheep. Well, a band of Telmarine soldiers attacked him (Wasn't in the book) and instead of The noble mouse greeting him cordially he gets ready to stab him saying, ""Choose your last words carefully, Telmarine!"" Of course he doesn't. The scene where Caspian has the parley with the Narnians, They all shout and act very hostile to Caspian. Not like in the book, where they all admire and respect him for a son of Adam. At the start of the movie, Caspian blows the horn. Not like in the book, where he blows it with much ceremony with Trumpkin and Trufflehunter. The part of the book where skirmishes and small battles happened before the horn was blown was all gone. Most of the scenes with the children and Trumpkin were lost in the forest floated away with the north wind. The worst offense of this movie, in my opinion, is the scene with Lucy and Aslan in the wood. The following scenes with Aslan leading them to the How and the festival with Bacchus and the Maenads were all gone. All of this ripping and tearing away from the book adds a grotesque amount of adding to the story with completely unnecessary scenes. Like this one, The Narnians are having a meeting to decide how to deal with the Telmarines and in a horrifying, totally made up scene, they all go raiding the Castle Miraz. WHAT?! It's here that we see Queen Susan the Gentle, turn into Queen Susan the Serial Killer. All throughout the book, Lewis talks about how ""Tenderhearted"" she was. And concerning Peter, He goes on like an immature child, squabbling with Caspian every spare moment. In the book, the first time Caspian and Peter meet, Caspian ""Was liking Peter very much, but was a bit tongue-tied."" Peter would have had ample wisdom and experience to know that he shouldn't go on a suicide mission to a impregnable castle and start raiding it! Keep in mind that that scene wasn't even in the book. After the imaginary castle raid, Nikabrik lures Caspian to call up Jadis' ghost. Question: Where was Trufflehunter and Cornelius? And Caspian, instead of responding with disgust and anger about that proposition as he did in the book, falls into it with eagerness. The Duel had two omissions. One, the dialogue between Glozelle and Sopespian was left out, and Sopespian killed Miraz in the movie, not Glozelle. Once the battle starts, it shoves all the wonderfull deeds of Aslan and the joyful parade with Lucy and Susan and the others when Caspian's nurse reunites with Caspian. Well, in the movie Caspian's nurse didn't exist. Finally, the worst and creepiest detail. At the end of the movie Caspian and Susan actually kiss each other. This was a idiotic backstory that really subtracted from the movie. In the name of Reepicheep, leave out that disgusting imaginary detail! All in all, if you like movies close to the book (Which I most certainly do), back away from this atrocity! If you never read Prince Caspian, then watch this movie. If you have read it, stay clear. It's just a pity all these awesome special effects and splendid acting were almost wasted on a movie so ridiculously far, far away from the beloved book that fathered it.",2,"Disney made this movie by tearing the book up, and trying to read the shreds!

DelParto ""Rose2""","[2, 4]","THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA:  PRINCE CASPIAN continues the story of four children, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley) and their return to Narnia.  They help Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) to revive the fantasy world that was once inhabited by the various talking creatures and king of the forest, Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson), after the land is invaded by the Telmarines.  And once again, there is the conflict between good and evil.The film focuses on Prince Caspian and his quest to recapture the thrown.  However, his leadership is in question.  In this installment of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, Caspian has to unite the creatures and people of Narnia and fight the Telmarines.  And one question comes to mind, is he able to return Narnia to its previous luster?  There is an array of themes within the film's storyline, leadership, chivalry, and camaraderie between the four children, Prince Caspian, and the beastly creatures, which gradually shows Caspian's strengths as well as challenges as a leader.  And this is displayed in one of the most powerful scenes in the film where Peter and King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto) conduct a duel.PRINCE CASPIAN leaves the enchantment behind.  This film is a far cry from the first CHRONICLES OF NARNIA because of the intense violence.  With the haunting chants of the movie's soundtrack, epic cinematography, extravagant costumes, there is a darker element to this film; viewers may identify the massive battle scenes to THE LORD OF THE RINGS, 300, and the previous HARRY POTTER films.  And this will definitely keep people at the edge of their seats.Although the film has a darker tone, there are a few lighter moments.  The enchanted creatures of the forest of Narnia offer a little comic relief to the movie, such as Trumpkin the dwarf (Peter Dinklage) and Reepicheep the mouse (voice of Eddie Izzard) who almost resembles the Puss n' Boots character in the Shrek films.  Another defining moment is the touching concluding scenes where Aslan and Lucy reunite as well as when the children depart from Narnia back to England.Overall, the film is an amazing display of excitement and adventure.  However, due to too many disturbing scenes of violence within the film, it may not be appropriate for young children.

The next thing they know, the wall behind them is moving.  It's magic, they know, and it takes them to Narnia.But, there weren't any ruins in Narnia.  Plus, the dancing trees no longer dance.  And the beasts in the woods aren't friendly anymore.  While a year has passed in their time, it's 1300 years in the future for Narnia.Narnia's been driven near to extinction by the Telmarines, a race of humans led by Lord Protector Miraz (Sergio Castellitto).  In the beginning, Miraz is only serving as regent for the Telmarine throne, but his wife is laboring in childbirth.  When the news comes that she's borne him a son, he sets plans in motion to kill his nephew Prince Caspian 10, the rightful heir to the throne (played by Ben Barnes).The Pevensale children: Peter, (William Moseley); Susan, (Anna Popplewell); Edmund, (Skandar Keynes); and Lucy, (Georgie Henley) meet Caspian and after a brief dispute between Peter and Caspian, cast their and their animal and dwarven kind friends' lots in with his. They know the Telmarines will invade quickly and choose to meet the enemy offensively.""Prince Caspian"" reminds me very much of ""The Two Towers"" in that there's quite a bit of fighting going on. From the minute Miraz realizes he has an heir, he's sending his men to kill his nephew and next to go after the remainder of the Narnians.The story is well-acted. Lucy (Henley) and Miraz (Castellitto) were two of the most interesting characters in the whole story and were at polar opposites of the good-evil continuum.  Lucy's faithful and the strongest believer in the magic of Narnia and her old friend, Aslan.  Miraz is just plain bad, he's a kinslayer, a backstabber, and the all-around-guy-you-love-to-hate. Kudos also to Eddie Izzard for Reepicheep the Mouse. His portrayal was exactly what I imagined for the brave little mouse.Director, Andrew Adamson did an excellent job hazing the battle scenes with grey implying the dust I'd imagine they'd stir up with the fight.  He also managed to capture the wondrous dancing trees, the mountains and the glory that is Narnia in a bright filter.Magical creatures, particularly the centaurs, were very well done. Effects for the one scene featuring Jadis, the Snow Queen were smooth and beautifully done.In my opinion, this is probably not a film for very young children.  There's a lot of violence and battle scenes.  While there's no splatter factor, I think the decapitations and other scenes might be hard on the younger kids.NOTE:  If you are planning on attending ""Prince Caspian"" for the next week, you probably will want to buy your tickets in advance or see the earliest show.

651022,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JPH2,RMurray847,"[1, 2]","As a child (probably over 30 years ago now), I read the CHRONICLES OF NARNIA every couple of years.  I loved the books, and at that time, they seemed like fast moving, exciting adventures to me.  Looking at them these days...they are charming but a little slow-paced for a modern audience.  I still highly recommend them as an introduction to epics for younger children (kids too young for LORD OF THE RINGS, for example)...but I also admit that they aren't exactly barn-burners.This was further borne out when I saw the made-for-TV British versions a few years ago.  While very faithful to the books...they moved at a glacial pace (and the special effects were pretty awful).  My kids couldn't get through them.So that's the main reason I so much appreciate the latest versions of these great stories.  Part 1, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE was very faithful to the original...yet added some epic action sequences to jazz up modern audiences.  My biggest problem with that film was the sometimes poor special effects (I thought The Beavers were pretty badly done...to the point of distraction) and I thought James McAvoy was poorly cast as Mr. Tumnus...again a big distraction.  I thought the kids were very good, and Tilda Swinton was probably the perfect person for her role.  I liked the movie...but I didn't love it.I almost love PRINCE CASPIAN, though.  For one thing, it's nice to see another book in the series getting loving attention.  Second, the four young leads have really grown as performers.  (Although the young man playing Edmund has grown just a tiny bit too much...no fault of his.)  I particularly liked both of the young actresses.  Susan is truly a young woman you would NOT want to mess with in a fight...she's empowered but not the least bit showy about it.  And Lucy is perfect...we believe she is always the one who keeps one eye out for Aslan.The kids return to Narnia after one year back on our earth...and 1300 years have gone by.  Their old palace is in ruins, and they quickly discover that a race of humans called the Telmarines have driven the ""magical"" denizens of Narnia out of their own land.  The current leader of Narnia is so cruel, in fact, that he has driven his own nephew Caspian (and rightful heir) out of Narnia and into the woods.  There Caspian meets his destiny.PRINCE CASPIAN is populated with delightful creations.  The dwarves are a delight...Peter Dinklage is an actor of considerable gravity and subtlety...and gives a heartbreaking performance.  Reepicheep the Mouse appears and steals his scenes...just as he does in the book.  There are badgers, mighty Centaurs, fearsome Minotaurs, etc.  Most of them are rendered better than in the first movie, and there were only a few moments where the CGI wasn't quite up to the task.  For the most part, these creatures felt very much like physical presences.Naturally, the book's modest action scenes are greatly enhanced for the film.  While the ending battles are truly spectacular and actually quite exciting...I enjoyed the sneak attack on the Telmarine fortress almost as much.  Not only was it exciting...it had emotional resonance.  The great High King Peter and the up-and-comer Caspian both get taken down a peg or two...at a great cost.I hate to reveal any more plot...because most kids are far less familiar with this story than the first.  It isn't exactly a groundbreaking plot...but it's done very well and will engage kids and adults alike.  It is rated PG...but I almost think PG-13 would have been more appropriate...it is VERY violent, and lots of people die.There are some weaknesses, of course...Ben Barnes as Caspian needs some maturing.  He looks the part, and no doubt is quite a handsome young man...but his acting skills are not up to his fellow-young people.  Perhaps if he returns in a sequel...he'll add some gravitas.  Also, the movie is just a little slow going early on.  One or two scenes of voyaging or trudging through woods could easily have been eliminated.  Once the film kicks into high gear, though...it's pretty terrific.  The script itself is fairly faithful to the book and serves its purpose...but it's not transformative.By no means is this film the masterwork that THE LORD OF THE RINGS series was.

651026,A2GXV3SMUHB7GB,B00005JPH2,"rogueshadowcrawler ""Rogue""","[3, 3]","First, I will start off by saying that if you are a Book Nazi, this movie is NOT for you. There are a lot of changes to the plot and some additional scenes added, as well as the Susan and Caspian romance (UGH - but more on that later). There is quite a bit removed and shuffled around in order for it to work as a film. But the thing is, it still works as a story. It's not perfect, but it is good.As a huge fan of the books and the first film, I was eagerly anticipating this one and was (mostly) not disappointed. True, there are significant differences in character development and the pacing of the story, but I think those changes work for the best. One such change is Peter's decision to attack the castle. Now, I know that this seems out of character for him, but if you really think about it, he's a kid eager to prove himself and also on his guard because of a new rival (Caspian). He's going to want to show that he really is King Peter the Magnificent. Well, he fails, of course, but it was still an incredibly well-done and tragic scene. William Moseley got some flack for being a little wooden in the first movie...well, just watch this scene, particularly toward the end. He's more than earned his acting stripes, in my opinion.Everything is better this time around: there is more character development, better special effects (particularly the CGI creatures), absolutely beautiful sets and backgrounds, and all the returning cast has improved in their performances. Georgie Henley and Skander Keynes in particular were a joy to watch - one look at Georgie and you can tell she'll be a real beauty when she's older. (And Skandar's filled out nicely himself...)That being said, I do have some quibbles with this movie. It's not perfect. There are a couple of awkward moments which are supposed to be comedic, but feel slightly out of place with the scope of the movie (the scene with Reepicheep, Pattertwig, and the nuts remark comes to mind here). It's much darker, which I enjoy, but this definitely isn't a movie for the nine-and-under set. And the most grievous change made in the movie for me was the addition of a budding romance between Susan and Caspian. This felt awkward, unnecessary, and forced (though it generated some great jokes, I'll admit). One of the things I appreciate so much about the Narnia books is that they were written in a much more innocent time and about children who didn't have romance on their minds all the time. I appreciate romance in my movies and books if it's well-done and believable, but Susan and Caspian's relationship was neither. Narnia is supposed to be a child's world, full of light and dark and beauty and magic, not hormones and romance. It's especially irritating because Caspian is going to meet his *wife* in the very next movie, so why do we even *need* he and Susan to have a ""connection""?Other than those small issues, this movie is magical.

651043,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00005JPH2,S. Rhodes,"[2, 3]","No one can doubt the success of the very first Chronicles of Narnia.  Prince Caspian is the fourth book in the series but it brings back the same loveable four characters from The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.  The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is a good movie, although there are moments when you feel it could've reached higher.1,300 years after the events of the first film, King Miras has a son, and is thrilled for this because he now has an heir to the throne.  The only thing standing in the way of his legacy is Prince Caspian.  He decides that he needs to get rid of Caspian and decides to assassinate him while he sleeps.  Unfortunately for Milas, Caspian has a smart professor who knows what's coming and manages to sneak Caspian out of the castle in the middle of the night.  The Prince is pursued by guards as he rides into the forbidden forest populated by the Narnians.  Unfortunately, the Narnians don't like him either for being a Telmarine.  Prince Caspian eventually blows the horn which will bring back the Kings and Queens of Narnia and thus our four heroes from the first film make their return to the land of Narnia to help Prince Caspian reclaim his throne and free the Narnians.Much like many sequels, it's bigger than the first one.  In the beginning of the film there's a lot of exposition.  Not much of which helps to develop the characters, but does help you get a sense of what happened to Narnia since the departure of the Kings and Queens.  That may be one of the small problems with the film.  It doesn't focus too much on its characters.  We know the four from the first film, but what about the new characters?  Specifically Prince Caspian.  He's one of the main characters, but he plays a backseat to most of the films moments.  Instead it focuses on our four heroes despite that Caspian is at the focal point of the plot.  In fact, if our four heroes from the first film  hadn't shown up, you probably wouldn't be too interested in Caspian's struggle because the film neglects to flesh him out as a character.On another note, for a PG movie, it manages to be very violent.  There's no blood flying, but there's enough death in here to bring about the question as to whether or not some of the younger kids should see this.The movie is 144 minutes long.  Most of which is because of the battles.  The battles look incredible, but they can get a little long and tedious.  At the very least they have some incredible looking special effects. Even better than the special effects is the musical score provided for the film.  Almost everything about this movie screams epic.The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian may not be better than the first film in the series, but it isn't too far off.  While the new characters aren't as interesting as the returning characters, the movie certainly gets a lot more things right than it does wrong.  If you liked the first movie, then chances are you'll like this one.",4,Not Quite Better Than the First But Still Fun,1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,2950,"['one', 'can', 'doubt', 'success', 'very', 'first', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'fourth', 'book', 'series', 'back', 'same', 'loveable', 'four', 'characters', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'good', 'movie', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'feel', 'could', ""'ve"", 'reached', 'higher.1,300', 'years', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'King', 'Miras', 'son', 'thrilled', 'now', 'heir', 'throne', 'only', 'thing', 'standing', 'way', 'legacy', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'get', 'rid', 'Caspian', 'assassinate', 'Unfortunately', 'Milas', 'Caspian', 'smart', 'professor', 'who', 'what', 'coming', 'manages', 'sneak', 'Caspian', 'castle', 'middle', 'night', 'Prince', 'pursued', 'guards', 'forbidden', 'forest', 'populated', 'Narnians', 'Unfortunately', 'Narnians', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'either', 'being', 'Telmarine', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'eventually', 'horn', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'Kings', 'Queens', 'Narnia', 'thus', 'four', 'heroes', 'first', 'film', 'make', 'return', 'land', 'Narnia', 'help', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'reclaim', 'throne', 'free', 'Narnians.Much', 'many', 'sequels', 'bigger', 'first', 'one', 'beginning', 'film', 'lot', 'exposition', 'Not', 'much', 'develop', 'characters', 'help', 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'happened', 'Narnia', 'departure', 'Kings', 'Queens', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'small', 'problems', 'film', ""n't"", 'focus', 'too', 'much', 'characters', 'know', 'four', 'first', 'film', 'what', 'new', 'characters', 'Specifically', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'backseat', 'most', 'films', 'moments', 'Instead', 'four', 'heroes', 'Caspian', 'focal', 'point', 'plot', 'fact', 'four', 'heroes', 'first', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'shown', 'up', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'interested', 'Caspian', 'struggle', 'film', 'neglects', 'flesh', 'out', 'character.On', 'note', 'PG', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'violent', 'blood', 'flying', 'enough', 'death', 'here', 'bring', 'about', 'question', 'not', 'younger', 'kids', 'should', 'see', 'this.The', 'movie', '144', 'minutes', 'long', 'Most', 'battles', 'battles', 'look', 'incredible', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'long', 'tedious', 'very', 'least', 'have', 'incredible', 'looking', 'special', 'effects', 'Even', 'better', 'special', 'effects', 'musical', 'score', 'provided', 'film', 'Almost', 'everything', 'movie', 'epic.The', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'better', 'first', 'film', 'series', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'off', 'new', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'interesting', 'returning', 'characters', 'movie', 'certainly', 'lot', 'more', 'things', 'right', 'wrong', 'liked', 'first', 'movie', 'then', 'chances', 'are', ""'ll"", 'like', 'one']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

This movie didn't come close to the power of that movie. Regardless, if you're a fan of the first movie, I feel it's worth your time to view this second flick.The first movie had such a positive, clear message of faith, love, forgiveness, standing up for what you believe in and redemption. The story along with the characters was so well developed. It had charm and depth. It was emotionally engaging.This one was darker, with much confusion, frustration and less of a clear message to take away. There was a lot of focus on the fighting, and there were several periods in the movie that were plain disturbing rather than moving. The sets were darker also. I felt as if there was no one to like. Caspian was hard to relate to. Even the four main characters from the prior movie were less likable and more challenging to sympathize with. The ending left me entirely unsatisfied and even a bit sad. The ""romance"" between the older Pevensie girls and Prince Caspian was a bit unbelievable.Yet, those who really enjoyed the first flick will want to see the continuation. The four Pevensie kids go back to Narnia and you'll want to follow the story. As in the first, the special effects are amazing, and the acting is top-notch. The introduction of the mouse character was enjoyable, and there were moments that made it worthwhile. While it doesn't live up to it's predecessor, it's still a decent movie.

651057,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00005JPH2,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 5]","Prince Caspian is every bit as entertaining as the first film in the adaptations of C.S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia. The action sequences and special effects continue to exponentially improve, but the plot remains haplessly repetitious. While Lewis may have created countless original ideas in his novels, the movies themselves have already been beat to the punch by The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Shrek and many others, causing Prince Caspian to feel like it's borrowing elements from other fantasy fare. Entertaining but predictable, this sequel is an admirable second chapter to the Narnia saga that is sure to win over fans old and new.Only a few years have passed in England, but thousands have drastically changed the war-torn lands of Narnia. When the heir to the throne, Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes), is betrayed by the scheming Lord Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), he inadvertently summons the kings and queens of old - Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy Pevensie (Georgie Henley). Forming an allegiance with the scattered Narnians, Prince Caspian and the Pevensies (with the help of a little magic and a talking lion) must wage war against Miraz's Telmarine army to once again restore peace to Narnia.The story starts right up without pausing considerably to educate unfamiliar or forgetful audiences as to the origins of Narnia, or to the magical elements that affect the Pevensie children. While many will grow accustomed to Narnia's paradisaical qualities, the children's return, without the use of the wardrobe, is rather inexplicit. Along those lines, the mysteries surrounding Aslan's apparitions, Lucy's selective use of her healing serum, and the unharnessed powers of Mother Nature all bring questions to the film; most of which are not answered.As the children mature, so do the Shakespearean themes and tone of this darker follow-up. Tragically, the biggest downfall to the fascinating world of Narnia and its engrossing inhabitants is the fact that nearly every idea has already been expended by other movies. C.S. Lewis may have crafted many of his creative elements years before Shrek or 300, but those movies beat Narnia to the big screen. Whether it's Reepicheep, who is unappealingly similar to Shrek's Puss In Boots, or the Telmarine infantry, whose armored masks closely resemble 300's Immortal army, Narnia simply doesn't feel original. It's a shame that many viewer's first encounter with the thaumaturgical inventions will be through the film and not the novels.Despite a Lord of the Rings: Return of the King conclusion (a comparison that fantasy films should avoid), Prince Caspian indeed amps up the adventure. Better action, superior use of slow-motion and family friendly violence (such as a PG decapitation) aid in the film's smooth pace and sustained action. A more savage, war-torn Narnia doesn't necessarily make a better one, but new heroes and villains, nonstop epic battles, and a mature setting help keep the second Chronicles afloat in the heavily treaded waters of fantasy tales.- The Massie Twins",3,Prince Caspian Movie Review,1210896000,"05 16, 2008",2008,3099,"['Prince', 'Caspian', 'bit', 'as', 'entertaining', 'first', 'film', 'adaptations', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'action', 'sequences', 'special', 'effects', 'continue', 'exponentially', 'improve', 'plot', 'haplessly', 'repetitious', 'Lewis', 'may', 'have', 'created', 'countless', 'original', 'ideas', 'novels', 'movies', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'beat', 'punch', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Shrek', 'many', 'others', 'causing', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'feel', 'borrowing', 'elements', 'other', 'fantasy', 'fare', 'Entertaining', 'predictable', 'sequel', 'admirable', 'second', 'chapter', 'Narnia', 'saga', 'sure', 'win', 'over', 'fans', 'old', 'new.Only', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'England', 'thousands', 'have', 'drastically', 'changed', 'war-torn', 'lands', 'Narnia', 'When', 'heir', 'throne', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'Ben', 'Barnes', 'betrayed', 'scheming', 'Lord', 'Miraz', 'Sergio', 'Castellitto', 'inadvertently', 'kings', 'queens', 'old', 'Peter', 'William', 'Moseley', 'Susan', 'Anna', 'Popplewell', 'Edmund', 'Skandar', 'Keynes', 'Lucy', 'Pevensie', 'Georgie', 'Henley', 'Forming', 'allegiance', 'scattered', 'Narnians', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'Pevensies', 'help', 'little', 'magic', 'talking', 'lion', 'must', 'wage', 'war', 'Miraz', 'Telmarine', 'army', 'once', 'again', 'restore', 'peace', 'Narnia.The', 'story', 'starts', 'right', 'up', 'pausing', 'considerably', 'educate', 'unfamiliar', 'forgetful', 'audiences', 'origins', 'Narnia', 'magical', 'elements', 'affect', 'Pevensie', 'children', 'many', 'will', 'grow', 'accustomed', 'Narnia', 'paradisaical', 'qualities', 'children', 'return', 'use', 'wardrobe', 'rather', 'inexplicit', 'lines', 'mysteries', 'surrounding', 'Aslan', 'apparitions', 'Lucy', 'selective', 'use', 'healing', 'serum', 'unharnessed', 'powers', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'bring', 'questions', 'film', 'most', 'are', 'not', 'children', 'mature', 'so', 'do', 'Shakespearean', 'themes', 'tone', 'darker', 'follow-up', 'Tragically', 'biggest', 'downfall', 'fascinating', 'world', 'Narnia', 'engrossing', 'inhabitants', 'fact', 'nearly', 'idea', 'already', 'been', 'expended', 'other', 'movies', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'may', 'have', 'crafted', 'many', 'creative', 'elements', 'years', 'Shrek', '300', 'movies', 'beat', 'Narnia', 'big', 'screen', 'Reepicheep', 'who', 'unappealingly', 'similar', 'Shrek', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'Telmarine', 'infantry', 'armored', 'masks', 'closely', 'resemble', '300', 'Immortal', 'army', 'Narnia', 'simply', ""n't"", 'feel', 'original', 'shame', 'many', 'viewer', 'first', 'encounter', 'thaumaturgical', 'inventions', 'will', 'be', 'film', 'not', 'novels.Despite', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Return', 'King', 'conclusion', 'comparison', 'fantasy', 'films', 'should', 'avoid', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'indeed', 'up', 'adventure', 'Better', 'action', 'superior', 'use', 'slow-motion', 'family', 'friendly', 'violence', 'such', 'PG', 'decapitation', 'aid', 'film', 'smooth', 'pace', 'sustained', 'action', 'more', 'savage', 'war-torn', 'Narnia', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'make', 'better', 'one', 'new', 'heroes', 'villains', 'nonstop', 'epic', 'battles', 'mature', 'setting', 'help', 'keep', 'second', 'Chronicles', 'afloat', 'heavily', 'treaded', 'waters', 'fantasy', 'tales.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian

Just saw ""Caspian"" last night with my daughter (she for the second time).I tend to agree with people who gave this 1 or 2 stars ... boring ... too violent, yet strangely bloodless ... characters made choices that seemed to make no sense... I often found myself thinking, ""Wait. Now why is s/he doing that?"".Given that, I'd like to add my ...RANDOM THOUGHTS:Not only was this movie dark (in the sense of violent), I found it to be just plain dark (as in hard to see). The beginning scene and the raid on the castle were too dark for me to see parts of it.I was bored.The young man who played Prince Caspian was apparently trying to channel Antonio Banderas. The accent was not needed.At almost 2.5 hours, ""Caspian"" was far too long and boring.Peter is the High King. He lives a grown up life in Narnia. Now we see him back in London, yearning not to be ""treated like a kid"" (or words to that effect). He returns to Narnia, only to constantly act like a wounded adolesent, getting into (pardon the expression) p*ssing matches with Prince Caspian time and time again.The young woman who played Queen Susan appears to be a foul mood most of the movie, which is too bad as she seems like a capable actress.The machismo especially seemed very opposite of the spirit of C.S. Lewis' writings. (Note to script writer: If you're going for the macho look, at least make it consistent. A Peter who couldn't handle a high school brawl suddenly turns into a killing machine on the field of battle?!? That made NO sense ...)The movie became considerably less boring once I realized I was watching ""Lord of the Rings for Kids,"" which gave me something to look for in the movie. There were so many scenes stolen from the LOTR trilogy that Peter Jackson should have been on the payroll. If you have to watch this movie, you can entertain yourself by asking, ""What scene from LOTR are they stealing now?"" throughout the movie. You'll be surprised what you come up with.Queen Susan needs to be rescued by Prince Caspian? Please. This is the 21st century!THE BRIGHT SIDE ...CASPIAN wasn't as bad as THE GOLDEN COMPASS.I'm a big Eddie Izzard fan, but I wasn't sure his voice was right for Reepicheep. I was wrong. Eddie Izzard was awesome! In the more boring moment of the movie, I found myself wanting more Reepicheep on screen. (Or maybe I was rooting for him to stab either Peter or Caspian ... or both). Go Eddie!The young lady who plays Lucy continues to be a delight to watch. She's quite talented. I look for big things from her as she grows as an actress.All in all, I'd suggest skipping this movie.

Now with the second installment of hopefully 7 films the world of Narnia takes on a very different shape.The same actors who played the Pevense children are back to reprise their roles, but Narnia itself is no longer a world filled with fantastic creatures and magic. 1300 years after the defeat of the White Witch Narnia has been taken over by a ruthless leader who wants Narnia to be a...normal place. A place that will appear just as bland and ordniary everywhere else. It it now up to the Pevense children to return an rescue Narnia from this new menace and discover the true king of Narnia, Prince Caspain.I was very surprised by this film. Much like the first Narnia film it was not an incredible movie, but it was just as enjoyable and the atmosphere was a little more dramatic and mature. There is a lot of dramatic sword fights and meaningful moments between the characters and the new roles are played well by actors such as Eddie Izzard and Ben Barnes. Now we have to see what the next film will bring. There is new leadership for these future projects now that Disney as given the project to Fox. I am hoping that the rest of this story keeps the same elements that made the first two movies enjoyable.",4,A big surprise for a sequel.

As in the first movie, it starts in an England torn by WWII. A mundane subway station magically becomes transport back to Narnia, which the children had left only a year earlier - but a mmillenium past, by that world's calendar. Their arrival signals a heroic myth returned to life.The story thinly veils C. S. Lewis's Christian allegory. Although I haven't read the books in years, I was surprised at how much of the Christ mythos came through. Secularists (like me) need not worry, though. The fantasy unfolds beautifully even if you ignore that aspect. The effect-masters bring Narnia's population of centaurs, fauns, and other beings to life very convincingly, and the battle scenes carry all the excitement, drama, and scope one could wish. Even Susan, the older girl, joins the battle - despite long skirts, light armor, and a ladylike (but deadly) longbow, she does as well in close combat as any of the others. Lucy, the little one, truly turns the battle though. You'll see for yourself. Just wait until her baby-fatted hand draws her tiny weapon against the entire invading army - the whole course the war changes at that moment.There's no way to know, perhaps this does carry the thrill and majesty of Lewis's vision of fiction.

And though this adaptation is not faithful to its source, the movie itself is entertaining with some great special effects [though not quite the caliber of LOTR].The story [unlike the book] begins in Narnia, where a woman gives birth to a boy and Prince Caspian [Ben Barnes, looking uncannily like a young Keanu Reeves] is awakened by his tutor/mentor and told to flee for his life, Turns out, Prince Caspian's uncle, the evil Lord Miraz [Sergio Castellito] now has an heir and is plotting the Prince's demise. Caspian flees into the forest where he meets Narnians, who have been presumed to be long extinct.Back in England, the Pevensie's are wondering if they'll ever go back to Narnia - it's been a year [their time] and Peter [William Moseley] yearns for the days when he was High King, his younger brother Edmund [Skandar Keynes] seems to be bailing his older brother out of brawls, Susan [Anna Popplewell] has blossomed into quite a lovely young lady and Lucy [Georgie Henley] also yearns to be back in Narnia. Their wish is granted when Caspian blows the horn that summons the Pevensie's back to Narnia. It seems that 1,300 yrs have passed since they were last there and things have changed drastically. Lucy claims to have seen Aslan, but none of the others have seen him and they don't believe Lucy. The siblings soon run into Caspian and band together to help the Narnians reclaim their kingdom from Lord Miraz and the Telmarines [the humans who live in Narnia].The spiritual themes that abound in C.S Lewis' work is not much evident here - to delve deeper into that aspect, one will have to read the books. I also felt that there were some unnecessary diversions such as the alluded to romantic spark between Caspian and Susan. Caspian's character is not very well-developed here. The acting of the main characters seem quite wooden most of the time, not much of an improvement since the last instalment. Also, some of the battle scenes seemed to be rip-offs from LOTR, though there were some interesting elements. I liked the chivalrous, warrior mouse Reepicheep [voice of Eddie Izzard] and also the dwarf Trumpkin [Peter Dinklage] - both made for credible and interesting supporting characters.Though definitely not in the caliber of LOTR, Prince Caspian is an entertaining epic movie and makes for an enjoyable viewing experience.",3,Enjoyable despite not being faithful to the book,1230595200,"12 30, 2008",2008,2577,"['Purists', 'will', 'revile', 'adaptation', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'quite', 'few', 'liberties', 'adapting', 'book', 'whole', 'thought', 'production', 'quality', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'previous', 'instalment', 'adaptation', 'not', 'faithful', 'source', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'great', 'special', 'effects', '[', 'not', 'caliber', 'LOTR', ']', '.The', 'story', '[', 'book', ']', 'Narnia', 'where', 'woman', 'birth', 'boy', 'Prince', 'Caspian', '[', 'Ben', 'Barnes', 'looking', 'uncannily', 'young', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', ']', 'awakened', 'tutor/mentor', 'told', 'flee', 'life', 'out', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'uncle', 'evil', 'Lord', 'Miraz', '[', 'Sergio', 'Castellito', ']', 'now', 'heir', 'plotting', 'Prince', 'demise', 'Caspian', 'flees', 'forest', 'where', 'Narnians', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'presumed', 'be', 'long', 'extinct.Back', 'England', 'Pevensie', 'are', 'wondering', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'go', 'back', 'Narnia', 'been', 'year', 'time', ']', 'Peter', '[', 'William', 'Moseley', ']', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'High', 'King', 'younger', 'brother', 'Edmund', '[', 'Skandar', 'Keynes', ']', 'be', 'bailing', 'older', 'brother', 'brawls', 'Susan', '[', 'Anna', 'Popplewell', ']', 'blossomed', 'quite', 'lovely', 'young', 'lady', 'Lucy', '[', 'Georgie', 'Henley', ']', 'also', 'be', 'back', 'Narnia', 'wish', 'granted', 'when', 'Caspian', 'horn', 'Pevensie', 'back', 'Narnia', '1,300', 'yrs', 'have', 'passed', 'were', 'last', 'there', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'drastically', 'Lucy', 'have', 'seen', 'Aslan', 'none', 'others', 'have', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Lucy', 'siblings', 'soon', 'run', 'Caspian', 'band', 'together', 'help', 'Narnians', 'reclaim', 'kingdom', 'Lord', 'Miraz', 'Telmarines', '[', 'humans', 'who', 'live', 'Narnia', ']', '.The', 'spiritual', 'themes', 'abound', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'work', 'not', 'much', 'evident', 'here', 'delve', 'deeper', 'aspect', 'one', 'will', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'also', 'felt', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'diversions', 'such', 'alluded', 'romantic', 'spark', 'Caspian', 'Susan', 'Caspian', 'character', 'not', 'very', 'well-developed', 'here', 'acting', 'main', 'characters', 'seem', 'quite', 'wooden', 'most', 'time', 'not', 'much', 'improvement', 'last', 'instalment', 'Also', 'battle', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'be', 'rip-offs', 'LOTR', 'were', 'interesting', 'elements', 'liked', 'chivalrous', 'warrior', 'mouse', 'Reepicheep', '[', 'voice', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', ']', 'also', 'dwarf', 'Trumpkin', '[', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', ']', 'made', 'credible', 'interesting', 'supporting', 'characters.Though', 'definitely', 'not', 'caliber', 'LOTR', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'entertaining', 'epic', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'experience']",The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian
