1607649,ALUSX7UPUNP0W,B00AB62ZP6,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Having seen just about every version of this classic holiday tale, I was looking forward to new take on Dicken's classic.  This story, to a certain extent, revels in being the gay version of the story, revolving around the title character set in the present as a nightclub owner who treats his employees like trash, and poops on good will and generosity--until the ghosts appear.There are some negatives to this film..the constant musical interludes from the ingenue singer in the nightclub would merely be distracting if they weren't annoying.  These sequences take up screen time unnecessarily, and put a comical spin on this story that feels forced and out-of-place.Other than that, the tale is a solid and dramatic life story that could have happened to anyone. From Scrooge's estrangement from his family, to forming a new familial relationship, and then buckling under to greed and callousness, there is a But-for-the-grace-of-God vibe here as Scrooge discovers that what seemed to be a good idea has consequences that he does not see. These consequences are tender, well-handled, and feel real as the actors portray simply what people do.Overall, without spoilers, I'd have to say this version is warm and has some realistically sad scenes to remind us of what the core of the Dickens classic is about.  There is an epilogue of sorts, following the end credits, and the last song sung by Barbara Streisand's son is 'Amazing'.  This story is a good addition to any Christmas collection.",4,Smart or Smart-aleck?
