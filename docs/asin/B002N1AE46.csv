1278760,AM18CU72YEWH5,B002N1AE46,A. J Terry,"[1, 2]","""Darwin's Darkest Hour"" is visually gorgeous, whether it's the many scenes in Darwin's upper-middle-class British home or the nature shots that are sometimes interspersed with them. It's also intellectual, consisting almost entirely of Darwin carefully explaining his theories to his wife Emma and his children. Never mind that in real life Emma had probably heard them all many times: The goal of this film is clearly to educate the viewer. I was hoping to learn something, because I'm an adult who does not work in the hard sciences and who has not heard Darwin's theories explained in detail since high school. It turned out that I've remembered all the material in the film, and have considered it part of the basic stuff that ""everyone knows.""  The film lacks real drama; it ends with Darwin receiving a copy of his just-published _The Origin of Species_, and does not enter the controversy that followed publication. Therefore, it was a overall a bit of a disappointment to me.BUT, I think this would be a fantastic movie to show to high school kids, and younger kids with good vocabularies, to explain Darwin's principles of evolution to them. And, since theories of evolution have also evolved since Darwin, this movie inspired me to start reading Stephen Jay Gould's books.",4,An excellent explanation of evolution for those unfamiliar with its basic principles,1259884800,"12 4, 2009",2009,1282,"['Darwin', 'Darkest', 'Hour', 'visually', 'gorgeous', 'many', 'scenes', 'Darwin', 'upper-middle-class', 'British', 'home', 'nature', 'shots', 'are', 'sometimes', 'interspersed', 'also', 'intellectual', 'consisting', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Darwin', 'carefully', 'explaining', 'theories', 'wife', 'Emma', 'children', 'Never', 'mind', 'real', 'life', 'Emma', 'had', 'probably', 'heard', 'many', 'times', 'goal', 'film', 'clearly', 'educate', 'viewer', 'was', 'hoping', 'learn', 'something', ""'m"", 'adult', 'who', 'not', 'work', 'hard', 'sciences', 'who', 'not', 'heard', 'Darwin', 'theories', 'explained', 'detail', 'high', 'school', 'turned', 'out', ""'ve"", 'remembered', 'material', 'film', 'have', 'considered', 'part', 'basic', 'stuff', 'everyone', 'film', 'real', 'drama', 'Darwin', 'receiving', 'copy', 'just-published', '_The', 'Origin', 'Species_', 'not', 'enter', 'controversy', 'followed', 'publication', 'Therefore', 'was', 'overall', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'me.BUT', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'show', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'younger', 'kids', 'good', 'vocabularies', 'explain', 'Darwin', 'principles', 'evolution', 'theories', 'evolution', 'have', 'also', 'evolved', 'Darwin', 'movie', 'inspired', 'start', 'reading', 'Stephen', 'Jay', 'Gould', 'books']",N/A

For anyone not familiar with the facts of Charles Darwin's life and his wife Emma who while a devout Christian was his biggest fan and supporter even when he was attacked by religious zealots after his books were published.The movie also shows his many children being loved, encouraged and mourned when some of them die and when two children are struck down with deadly diseases, such as small pox and diphtheria which were common.  And what I so loved and wonder if many people who like or dislike the man, know what an ethical man he was.Like when a young self made explorer (Alfred Wallace) seems to 'borrow' from some of the writings of Darwin, placing Darwin in an difficult position because he doesn't feel at ease tooting his own horn.  Its nice that the movie disperses modern film segments to show various animals that Darwin encountered in his travels which led to some of his works like Origins of the Species.  And the movie is so timely because it shows how in the 1820's and 1830's his father may have been a free thinker but the Unitarian church was seen as the church where Christians who had given up on Christianity went.  And the movie notes Darwin felt that one could believe in a God and still believe in evolution.The movie also shows the concern he had about  his wife Emma  being  his first cousin, because he wondered aloud if the reason some of their children had died so young was because of genetic issues.  Fact is tuberculosis, small pox and other diseases were the norm at the time.  It was the death of his daughter Anne Elizabeth at the age of ten that effected him the deepest because she loved his work and had great conversations with her father.  In a way it reminded me of how the father of the Walton's television series also avoided church.  After her death he preferred taking walks and appreciating the creation around him.  And he seemed to get brushed off with nonsensical answers to serious religious questions when he asked them.This being the 200th anniversary of his birth I think this is a wonderful movie to own and watch, and to expose children to.",5,A must own and watch DVD!!!,1254787200,"10 6, 2009",2009,2219,"['British', 'do', 'historical', 'movies', 'so', 'well', 'having', 'seen', 'PBS', 'am', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'DVD', 'come', 'November', 'anyone', 'not', 'familiar', 'facts', 'Charles', 'Darwin', 'life', 'wife', 'Emma', 'who', 'devout', 'Christian', 'was', 'biggest', 'fan', 'supporter', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'attacked', 'religious', 'zealots', 'books', 'were', 'published.The', 'movie', 'also', 'many', 'children', 'being', 'loved', 'encouraged', 'mourned', 'when', 'die', 'when', 'two', 'children', 'are', 'struck', 'down', 'deadly', 'diseases', 'such', 'small', 'pox', 'diphtheria', 'were', 'common', 'what', 'so', 'loved', 'wonder', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'dislike', 'man', 'know', 'what', 'ethical', 'man', 'when', 'young', 'self', 'made', 'explorer', 'Alfred', 'Wallace', ""'borrow"", 'writings', 'Darwin', 'placing', 'Darwin', 'difficult', 'position', ""n't"", 'feel', 'ease', 'tooting', 'own', 'horn', 'nice', 'movie', 'modern', 'film', 'segments', 'show', 'various', 'animals', 'Darwin', 'encountered', 'travels', 'led', 'works', 'Origins', 'Species', 'movie', 'so', 'timely', 'how', '1820', '1830', 'father', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'free', 'thinker', 'Unitarian', 'church', 'was', 'seen', 'church', 'where', 'Christians', 'who', 'had', 'given', 'up', 'Christianity', 'went', 'movie', 'notes', 'Darwin', 'felt', 'one', 'could', 'believe', 'God', 'still', 'believe', 'evolution.The', 'movie', 'also', 'concern', 'had', 'wife', 'Emma', 'being', 'first', 'cousin', 'wondered', 'aloud', 'reason', 'children', 'had', 'died', 'so', 'young', 'was', 'genetic', 'issues', 'Fact', 'tuberculosis', 'small', 'pox', 'other', 'diseases', 'were', 'norm', 'time', 'was', 'death', 'daughter', 'Anne', 'Elizabeth', 'age', 'ten', 'effected', 'deepest', 'loved', 'work', 'had', 'great', 'conversations', 'father', 'way', 'reminded', 'how', 'father', 'Walton', 'television', 'series', 'also', 'avoided', 'church', 'death', 'preferred', 'taking', 'walks', 'appreciating', 'creation', 'seemed', 'get', 'brushed', 'off', 'nonsensical', 'answers', 'serious', 'religious', 'questions', 'when', 'asked', 'them.This', 'being', '200th', 'anniversary', 'birth', 'think', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'own', 'watch', 'expose', 'children']",N/A
1278763,A1B79U197FOH05,B002N1AE46,"G. M. Casey ""gcasem""","[1, 5]","Darwin's Darkest Hour is indeed very engaging.  The apologists for Darwin have crafted a delightful Darwin household where life could not  be  more ideal.  Darwin is a handsome and dashing young man,  Emma is a devoted wife that is fully interested in all of her husband's work, the children are never misbehaved, and even the Butler has the deepest affection for the youngest of the Darwin clan.  This unrealistic presentation of Darwin helps to sell the simple idea of the evolution of all life from the simplest forms over millions of years.The movie focuses in on the year before Darwin publishes his famous On the Origin of Species when Alfred Russell Wallace has also come up with a theory of evolution that is much like Darwin's own.  The concern is who will receive priority for the theory.  In the movie this is the main concern of Darwin with help from his wife, but also it is of major concern to Darwin's colleagues Charles Lyell and Joseph Hooker.  The movie has Darwin arrive at an honorable way of obtaining priority but history  seems to indicate otherwise.Ian Taylor, the author of In the Minds of Men which is also obtainable at Amazon,  has uncovered research that reveals a different Darwin, one that Taylor claims was part of a conspiracy.  Taylor writes that  Francis Darwin extensively edited his father's autobiography and his correspondence at the insistence of his widowed mother Emma, because that information was thought to be potentially damaging to the Darwin name.  But the correspondence has been restored through the notebooks of Charles Lyell and the 6,000 words Francis took out of the autobiography have been restored.  Taylor writes that the unexpurgated autobiography and the restored correspondence reveal Darwin to be less than the saint earlier biographies made him out to be.A theme that runs through the movie is the intense opposition if Darwin should make his theory public since it runs counter to the teaching of the church, Christianity, and the Bible.  In particular Darwin is warned of the intense hatred he will face, and his family will face, once he publishes his book.  The movie gives no credit to Christians who will oppose him but without any malice which is what occurred in that century.  For example, the eminent London pastor Charles Haddon Spurgeon voiced his opposition to evolution, but without the slightest trace of the hatred the characters in the movie predict.  Also eminent scientists such as Lord Kelvin opposed Darwin, but I don't think anyone can find anywhere any expression of hatred on Kelvin's part.  Darwin was  no doubt hated by some people, but credit should be given to Christians who faithfully follow the Master's command to ""Love your enemies.  Do good to them that despitefully use you.""  In sum the movie presents a warrantless prejudice against religious folk.In the 150 years since Darwin, science has shown him wrong and the Bible (which he and his disciples have tried to disprove) has shown to be correct.  Even Darwin's attempt to raise pigeons should have shown him he could not break the species barrier.  Darwin only managed to show that a pigeon will remain a pigeon.  The Lord indeed did create things to reproduce after its own kind.  And organisms have continued without any significant change over thousands of years as former evolutionist Dr. Carl Werner demonstrates cogently in his very readable book and DVD called Living Fossils.  He has found that  countless numbers  of organisms have not changed since the Cretaceous, despite the fact that evolutionists try to claim otherwise by  keeping this sort of evidence out of their museum displays.  Werner has found for example,  and this is a small example, practically every bird we know of today was alive during the time of the dinosaurs,  pelicans,  cormorants, owls, parrots, flamingoes, etc., etc.  And they looked then much like they look today.As a science teacher I have found over the decades as Dr. Werner and many other's have found, there is not the slightest evidence for evolution.  Rather the evidence is on the side of the Bible - very much so.  Darwin and his disciples bit off more than they could chew when they assaulted the foundations of Christianity.Finally the movie Darwin [and perhaps the historical Darwin] cannot believe that God could be a benevolent God since he observes that a certain wasp lays its eggs in a caterpillar to allow its larvae to eventually eat the caterpillar alive from the inside.  Well, evolutionists always find some fault with God's creation.  Another example is from the evolutionist, the late Stephen J. Gould, who pointed out the Panda's thumb as a reason to similarly find fault.  Other evolutionists have pointed out aspects of the human eye and how the light sensitive rods and cones are positioned incorrectly (according to them)  in the back of the eye.  What evolutionists fail to realize is the myriad ways in which God has provided not only for the animals but also for humans which are clear demonstrations of his care and his forethought for them.",3,Darwin's Darkest Hour not Always True to History,1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,5065,"['Darwin', 'Darkest', 'Hour', 'indeed', 'very', 'engaging', 'apologists', 'Darwin', 'have', 'crafted',

1278767,A2M936H1RSLS5Z,B002N1AE46,Steven Schafersman,"[3, 5]","Darwin's Darkest Hour -- a new drama about Darwin's decision to publish his work on evolution -- aired 2009 October 6 on public broadcasting stations around the country.I really enjoyed Darwin's Darkest Hour. The story used many flashbacks to briefly show us some significant points in Darwin's career and for the most part presented them accurately. The script used many quotations from Darwin's letters and books to depict him truthfully. The high prevalence of infant mortality in the nineteenth century was dramatically illustrated. Darwin lost two sons in infancy, but the most devastating loss was his daughter Annie when she was ten. That was the end of whatever religious belief he had left. Anne Darwin--who was lovingly portrayed in the drama in flashbacks--was Darwin's favorite child. When she died of scarlet fever, he wrote in his personal journal, ""We have lost the joy of the household, and the solace of our old age ... Oh that she could now know how deeply, how tenderly we do still & and shall ever love her dear joyous face."" Annie died in 1851, seven years before the major events of the drama. The drama depicts the death of an infant son in 1858 in more detail.The main story is Darwin's emotional reticence to publish his radical theory with all the evidence he had compiled that proved its truth. He knew there would be a public outcry and the prospect was unpleasant to him, since his wife was a religious believer as were other members of his family and friends, such as Charles Lyell and Joseph Hooker. Finally Wallace's letter forced him to publish. Darwin's friends Lyell and Hooker arranged to publish simultaneously Wallace's letter and Darwin's earlier written--but never published--essay on evolution. After this was done Wallace gave Darwin complete priority when he learned that Darwin had come to the theory 20 years earlier and was still compiling evidence for his ""big book."" This book was never published in Darwin's lifetime but parts of it were published in The Origin of Species which Darwin quickly wrote using much of the information he had already compiled. The religious conflict between Darwin and his wife is mentioned but not really emphasized. Emma comes across as much more sympathetic to Charles and supportive of his goals than as someone who is hurt by his new scientific discovery that revolutionized the human relationship to nature and undermined Christian religious beliefs.As is well-known, the joint publication of Darwin and Wallace's new hypothesis of natural selection had virtually no impact on biology, but Darwin's book about a year later finally had a major effect, since it had, in addition to proposing the hypothesis of natural selection in much greater detail, the much greater benefit of providing the abundant scientific evidence that species evolved, most of which was unknown to the public. Within a decade, evolution replaced creationism among almost all scientists and the educated public as the explanation for the origin of species, including humans. Natural selection, on the other hand, was not fully accepted by biologists until the 1930s, long after Darwin died.The Charles Darwin depicted is very kind to his wife, explaining everything to her about his theory and asking for her help in editing letters and manuscripts. Emma is very supportive and enthusiastic for her husband's success. These two are the main characters of the drama, and both are portrayed by very attractive actors. I told my wife that ""Emma is hot"" and she replied ""Darwin is hot, too."" The story is a costume drama and very beautifully produced and filmed. A few minutes of extras at the end told us that all the scenes were shot in Nova Scotia, filling in for the beaches of Scotland and the Galapagos, the mountains of the Andes (with some CGI additions), the streets and buildings of London, and the English countryside, lakes, manors, and gardens.Of great interest to me was the depiction of Darwin's father, Dr. Robert Darwin, who was the physician to many wealthy English aristocrats and businessmen and their families. His lucrative practice left him a wealthy man and enabled Charles to live the life of a gentleman scientist. Also, both Robert and Charles married Wedgwood daughters (Emma and Charles were first cousins!) who both inherited extremely large bequests upon the death of their fathers who were among the wealthiest men in England (and as has been recently revealed in Darwin's Sacred Cause: How a Hatred of Slavery Shaped Darwin's Views on Human Evolution, the major financial supporters of the successful abolition movement in Britain). In the drama, Robert is depicted as a ""Unitarian"" like his father, the famous natural philosopher and writer Erasmus Darwin, but in fact both were nonbelievers who kept their religious views very private. Robert's first son and Charles' older brother, Erasmus, not pictured in this drama, was also a nontheist. Charles had been prepared for the Anglican clergy and was slow to adopt the religious beliefs of his male family members, but eventually did so.In the drama, Robert advises his son during a carriage ride to be very careful about publicizing his new theory of evolution, because it would strike against the religious beliefs of much of his family and friends, dishearten them, and perhaps damage his reputation among the public (as in fact happened to Charles's grandfather Erasmus when he was publicly denounced by a conservative British MP) . Since Dr. Robert Darwin died in 1848, ten years before the main action of the drama, this carriage ride was fictional and the scene was created for dramatic effect. However, the sentiments are genuine, since Robert, unlike his father Erasmus and eventually his son Charles, shied away from all controversy. The earlier scene in which Robert berates his son and initially refuses to allow him to journey on the Beagle is also true.Darwin's Darkest Hour did not portray the loss of Darwin's faith due to the problem of innocent suffering in nature, a theological problem that theodicy, a branch of Christian apologetics, tries to explain. However, the new movie Creation, starring another beautiful couple, Paul Bettany as Charles and Jennifer Connelly as Emma, does deal much more with Annie's death, Charles's loss of religious faith, and the sensitivity of Charles's conflict with Emma's devout Christian beliefs. This movie finally found a U. S. distributor after some controversy, and I hope to be able to see it in the near future. When I do, I will review it here.For more insight into Darwin's loss of faith and the reasons for it, see my essay on Darwin Day. Humanity should celebrate Darwin Day every year, for Darwin was the first to attempt to understand and explain the human mind's connection to biological nature, which was ultimately his greatest
