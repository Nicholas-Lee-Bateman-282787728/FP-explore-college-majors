Lalo's DVD is a refreshing alternative to a lot of the more traditional training videos available today.  I combine this workout with my kettlebell routines to get a more thorough workout, but it also works well on its on.  I like the fact that minimal equipment is required and I also like his breaks between the circuits.  He creates a peaceful atmosphere while working your entire body.  I look forward to his second video, which he indicated that he is working on.  I received an unexpected letter from his company as well as a business card; this was a nice touch and a genuine attempt reach out to the customer in a positive manner.",5,Great Circuit Training DVD; Great Trainer!,1243296000,"05 26, 2009",2009,714,"[""'d"", 'heard', 'lot', 'good', 'things', 'video', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Lalo', 'DVD', 'refreshing', 'alternative', 'lot', 'more', 'traditional', 'training', 'videos', 'available', 'today', 'combine', 'workout', 'kettlebell', 'routines', 'get', 'more', 'thorough', 'workout', 'also', 'well', 'fact', 'minimal', 'equipment', 'required', 'also', 'breaks', 'circuits', 'peaceful', 'atmosphere', 'working', 'entire', 'body', 'look', 'forward', 'second', 'video', 'indicated', 'working', 'received', 'unexpected', 'letter', 'company', 'as', 'well', 'business', 'card', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'genuine', 'attempt', 'out', 'customer', 'positive', 'manner']",LaloFit
489348,A35V1NGNJMQTY6,9763600200,Amazon Customer,"[5, 6]","This video will give you a challenging total body workout. Lots of lunges(but NO forward lunges, which are harder on the knee) squats, burpees, plank-push-ups, traditional push-ups and some very challenging balancing work. The cardio intervals are jumping jacks, high knee runs, speed skaters, and burpees to name a few, He also uses some kickboxing moves like side kicks, upper cuts, with weights, and some cross-over punches, with weights. Lalo also does some very nice classical AB's exercises.  Most all of these moves are done with his signature ""freeze"" technique all moves are so deliberate and control, that you could go really heavy on the weights. Lalo finishes off with a very nice stretching routine. The music is really really good, and there is a music only feature which is a nice option to have. Be forewarned Lalo cueing is very minimum to none, so you'll have to watch him and count your reps yourself, this video is also a ""voice-over"" and is NOT chaptered. That being said I sweated a lot and I really enjoyed this challenging total body workout; my heart rate was up there. I'm sure you'll see results if you do this workout 2-3 x per week and you're careful with your diet",5,Contemporary Workout that Works for Me!!,1236297600,"03 6, 2009",2009,1194,"['video', 'will', 'give', 'challenging', 'total', 'body', 'workout', 'Lots', 'lunges', 'NO', 'forward', 'are', 'harder', 'knee', 'squats', 'burpees', 'plank-push-ups', 'traditional', 'push-ups', 'very', 'challenging', 'balancing', 'work', 'cardio', 'intervals', 'are', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'high', 'knee', 'runs', 'speed', 'skaters', 'burpees', 'name', 'few', 'also', 'kickboxing', 'moves', 'side', 'kicks', 'upper', 'cuts', 'weights', 'cross-over', 'punches', 'weights', 'Lalo', 'also', 'very', 'nice', 'classical', 'AB', 'exercises', 'Most', 'moves', 'are', 'done', 'signature', 'freeze', 'technique', 'moves', 'are', 'so', 'deliberate', 'control', 'could', 'go', 'really', 'heavy', 'weights', 'Lalo', 'very', 'nice', 'stretching', 'routine', 'music', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'music', 'only', 'feature', 'nice', 'option', 'have', 'Be', 'forewarned', 'Lalo', 'cueing', 'very', 'minimum', 'none', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'count', 'reps', 'video', 'also', 'voice-over', 'NOT', 'chaptered', 'being', 'said', 'sweated', 'lot', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'challenging', 'total', 'body', 'workout', 'heart', 'rate', 'was', 'up', 'there', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'see', 'results', 'do', 'workout', '2-3', 'x', 'week', ""'re"", 'careful', 'diet']",LaloFit

I won't describe the exercises because some of the other reviewers already have.I finished this workout and my legs felt alive.  Have put this one in my weekly line-up of workouts.  Tomorrow I will probably be very sore but it will be a good sore.Looking forward to seeing some more DVD's from LALO.,5,Love It  !!!!,1251244800,"08 26, 2009",2009,379,"['workout', 'type', 'workout', 'fancy', 'set', 'just', 'good', 'old', 'hard', 'work', 'wo', ""n't"", 'describe', 'exercises', 'other', 'reviewers', 'already', 'have.I', 'finished', 'workout', 'legs', 'felt', 'alive', 'Have', 'put', 'one', 'weekly', 'line-up', 'workouts', 'Tomorrow', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'very', 'sore', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'sore.Looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'DVD', 'LALO']",LaloFit

Great workout, led by a very attractive Mr. Lalo Fuentes.The workout is 54 minutes with good chaptering.  I really appreciated Lalo's exceptional form and I felt the freeze technique was the key to making my legs work so hard.The music is really good...Lalo does Not work out to the beat of the music (something that used to bother me, but I got used to after doing Jillian Michaels's workouts).My main issues are:* Lalo really burns out the shoulders/core/legs and to a certain extent, chest, but no weighted bicep/tricep/back work At All.  I ended up adding in some biceps and triceps work during a couple of the lunge sequences, and did some pullovers during the 2nd set of pushups to even out the workout.  I'm really hoping that Lalo has some reasoning behind doing this, hopefully his next workout will focus heavily on biceps, triceps, and back.* During the cooldown stretch, Lalo doesn't tell you when you're changing to a different stretch, so if you aren't watching the screen, Lalo will be doing a different stretch than yourself.  I found myself about 2 stretches behind on 3 different occasions...I felt that was a little sloppy, considering Lalo is doing all of this on voice over.  I don't think it would have killed him to mention that he was going to move on to another stretch.Overall, a very nice workout that really flew by...easy to bring the workout to the 34 minute mark and stop when you're pressed for time (after 34 minutes, it's mostly pushups and ab work with a couple of sets of burpees).",4,"Great sweaty workout, with a couple of issues",1241913600,"05 10, 2009",2009,1564,"['just', 'finished', 'Lalofit', 'legs', 'are', 'shot', 'Great', 'workout', 'led', 'very', 'attractive', 'Mr.', 'Lalo', 'Fuentes.The', 'workout', '54', 'minutes', 'good', 'chaptering', 'really', 'appreciated', 'Lalo', 'exceptional', 'form', 'felt', 'freeze', 'technique', 'was', 'key', 'making', 'legs', 'work', 'so', 'hard.The', 'music', 'really', 'good', 'Lalo', 'Not', 'work', 'out', 'beat', 'music', 'something', 'used', 'bother', 'got', 'used', 'doing', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'workouts', '.My', 'main', 'issues', 'are', '*', 'Lalo', 'really', 'out', 'shoulders/core/legs', 'certain', 'extent', 'chest', 'weighted', 'bicep/tricep/back', 'work', 'All', 'ended', 'up', 'adding', 'biceps', 'triceps', 'work', 'couple', 'lunge', 'sequences', 'did', 'pullovers', '2nd', 'set', 'pushups', 'even', 'out', 'workout', ""'m"", 'really', 'hoping', 'Lalo', 'reasoning', 'doing', 'hopefully', 'next', 'workout', 'will', 'focus', 'heavily', 'biceps', 'triceps', 'back', '*', 'cooldown', 'stretch', 'Lalo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'when', ""'re"", 'changing', 'different', 'stretch', 'so', 'are', ""n't"", 'watching', 'screen', 'Lalo', 'will', 'be', 'doing', 'different', 'stretch', 'found', '2', 'stretches', '3', 'different', 'occasions', 'felt', 'was', 'little', 'sloppy', 'considering', 'Lalo', 'doing', 'voice', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'mention', 'was', 'going', 'move', 'stretch.Overall', 'very', 'nice', 'workout', 'really', 'flew', 'easy', 'bring', 'workout', '34', 'minute', 'mark', 'stop', 'when', ""'re"", 'pressed', 'time', '34', 'minutes', 'mostly', 'pushups', 'ab', 'work', 'couple', 'sets', 'burpees']",LaloFit
