1671988,A22I4XH2VYPDQU,B00FLCRAVE,"Asian Mack ""Art""","[16, 17]","""The Cat"" aka ""Two Eyes That See Death"" is making its Western shores blu-ray debut in January. I saw this film in 2012. For those that may think that Asian Horror has gotten stale, this is the film to restore your faith. My wife and I were terrified watching this film. If you like K-Horror films like ""Phone"", ""A Tale of Two Sisters"", ""Arang"", ""Apartment"", ""Epitaph"", ""Ryeong"" and others, then this one will please you as well. Can't wait for this blu-ray!!! Kudos to Well Go USA! Now if Well Go USA can just release ""Howling"" (2012) starring Song Kang Ho on blu-ray; another awesome film!",5,The film that terrified South Korea in 2011...props to Well Go USA!,1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,590,"['Cat', 'Two', 'Eyes', 'See', 'Death', 'making', 'Western', 'shores', 'blu-ray', 'debut', 'January', 'saw', 'film', '2012', 'may', 'think', 'Asian', 'Horror', 'gotten', 'stale', 'film', 'restore', 'faith', 'wife', 'were', 'terrified', 'watching', 'film', 'like', 'K-Horror', 'films', 'Phone', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'Arang', 'Apartment', 'Epitaph', 'Ryeong', 'others', 'then', 'one', 'will', 'please', 'as', 'well', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'blu-ray', 'Kudos', 'Well', 'Go', 'USA', 'Now', 'Well', 'Go', 'USA', 'can', 'just', 'release', 'Howling', '2012', 'starring', 'Song', 'Kang', 'Ho', 'blu-ray', 'awesome', 'film']",The Cat
1671989,A3JWR2O1MZ7VNE,B00FLCRAVE,Elizabeth Renee Blue,"[9, 9]","Glad that line was displayed immediately after the last scene. I was worried. Its hard for me to give this movie a 5 star rating, as a cat lover, given the hardship the poor guys faced throughout the movie. However, the humans were getting theirs too. Plus, I think its only a reflection of reality, and portraying the inhumanity of the human species can hardly be cause to deduct a star from an otherwise very well done and entertaining film.The synopsis is all you really need to know about the plot. Its a very interesting and engaging story, with the ""why"" of it all, gradually unfolding at a proper pace. The thematic content is nothing new but the casting of cats to tell it is and kept it from becoming an ""oh, that again"",storyline. .The acting was strong and effective. The visuals were striking and production values high. No complaints regarding the music or sound effects. No complaints at all. If  you enjoy Asian horror, I think you will be satisfied by this offering. I sure was. I will watch it again, despite how tough it was at times to watch the plight of the cats in the film. FYI, I don't mean a sicko individual cat torturer but institutionalized cruelty, as in shelters, for the most part. There were some individuals whose behavior would've earned them a butt kicking if I was around.. But like I said, the cats scored some points too. .",5,A Horror Junkie's review: No Cats Were Harmed in the Making of this Film,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,1361,"['Glad', 'line', 'was', 'displayed', 'immediately', 'last', 'scene', 'was', 'worried', 'hard', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'cat', 'lover', 'given', 'hardship', 'poor', 'guys', 'faced', 'movie', 'However', 'humans', 'were', 'getting', 'theirs', 'too', 'think', 'only', 'reflection', 'reality', 'portraying', 'inhumanity', 'human', 'species', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'cause', 'deduct', 'star', 'otherwise', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'entertaining', 'film.The', 'synopsis', 'really', 'need', 'know', 'plot', 'very', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'story', 'why', 'gradually', 'unfolding', 'proper', 'pace', 'thematic', 'content', 'nothing', 'new', 'casting', 'cats', 'tell', 'kept', 'becoming', 'oh', 'again', 'storyline', 'acting', 'was', 'strong', 'effective', 'visuals', 'were', 'striking', 'production', 'values', 'high', 'complaints', 'regarding', 'music', 'sound', 'effects', 'complaints', 'enjoy', 'Asian', 'horror', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied', 'offering', 'sure', 'was', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'how', 'tough', 'was', 'times', 'watch', 'plight', 'cats', 'film', 'FYI', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'sicko', 'individual', 'cat', 'torturer', 'institutionalized', 'cruelty', 'shelters', 'most', 'part', 'were', 'individuals', 'behavior', 'would', ""'ve"", 'earned', 'butt', 'kicking', 'was', 'around..', 'said', 'cats', 'scored', 'points', 'too']",The Cat

1671992,A38RF06HMSYVLO,B00FLCRAVE,"P. A. Clark ""P.A. Clark""","[0, 1]","Not really my cup of tea, but still an original plot.In the film, So-yeon works as a pet groomer, where she enjoys a rather peaceful life, until one of her clients dies. In fact, she dies soon after picking up her cat, Silky, from So-yoen's business.  Not knowing what to do with the cat, the police allow So-yeon to take the cat home. Once she does, she begins to see the image of a little girl haunting her. Both at her house and at her business. It complicates matters for So-yeon who also happens to be claustrophobic. At first she thinks seeing the little girl could be psychological, but soon she discovers otherwise as more misfortunes follow her through the people she knows. Later, she discovers that more cats are connected to the haunting and a slight mystery develops. The film takes a few interesting twists and turns until it reaches a predictable conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.Well, I liked how this film used an original idea. However, for me, a cat is not a frightening creature. Granted, the film did jump me a few times, but it didn't have the full scare potential that it could have. Cats being a big part of the horror aspect was the culprit.  However, the little girl haunting So-yeon did add some spice. But it wasn't done as well like I've seen in other films. The Japanese movie Dark Water comes to mind. That story also involves the haunting of a little girl and was a lot scarier in my opinion. Plus, if I'm not mistaken, The Cat may have borrowed a few ideas from Dark Water. It was very reminiscent of Dark Water near the end.In addition, the mystery about the little girl was rather weak in my opinion. It seems to get shoved at you near the end of the film, like it was trying to conveinently tie things up. Almost like the film was deciding whether the horror aspect was supposed to be about the cats or the little girl. I got everything by the end, but it didn't blow me out of the water. It was very run of the mill.On the up side, one of the more interesting factors in the film is So-yoen's claustrophobia. It plays a role in some of her encounters and creates more terror for her. I also liked the back story of her friend and her boyfriend's ex. That helped bring a little more drama to the situation and helped set the tone for the type of person So-yeon was. Basically a gentle woman who has a big heart for both people and animals alike, particularly cats. It was in contrast to many of the people she came across in the film. But this is also a complaint, as it seemed like the contrast was just an excuse to create more targets for the haunting. At least, that's the way it came across to me.In any case, the film is in Korean only with English subtitles. No other features appear.In the end I gave the film three stars. It was fairly original in its ideas, and So-yoen was likeable enough. I also liked the back story with her friend and the little love triangle it created. But the love triangle gets cut short in my opinion, due to the film trying push more horror onto the viewer. So it was a mixed bag for me.Also, here's a slight warning note for you if you like cats. This film may not sit well with people who are avid cat lovers, as there are a few scenes that aren't very forgiving to cats. But if you are a cat lover, it might heighten the creepiness factor for you. You never know, people are different. Not a terrible film, just not a great one either. A decent rental at best, but probably not a keeper for most.",3,Creepy Cat Story!,1398038400,"04 21, 2014",2014,3476,"['Not', 'really', 'cup', 'tea', 'still', 'original', 'plot.In', 'film', 'So-yeon', 'pet', 'groomer', 'where', 'rather', 'peaceful', 'life', 'one', 'clients', 'dies', 'fact', 'soon', 'picking', 'up', 'cat', 'Silky', 'So-yoen', 'business', 'Not', 'knowing', 'what', 'do', 'cat', 'police', 'allow', 'So-yeon', 'take', 'cat', 'home', 'Once', 'see', 'image', 'little', 'girl', 'haunting', 'house', 'business', 'matters', 'So-yeon', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'claustrophobic', 'first', 'seeing', 'little', 'girl', 'could', 'be', 'psychological', 'soon', 'otherwise', 'more', 'misfortunes', 'follow', 'people', 'Later', 'more', 'cats', 'are', 'connected', 'haunting', 'slight', 'mystery', 'develops', 'film', 'few', 'interesting', 'twists', 'predictable', 'conclusion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'you.Well', 'liked', 'how', 'film', 'used', 'original', 'idea', 'However', 'cat', 'not', 'frightening', 'creature', 'Granted', 'film', 'did', 'jump', 'few', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'full', 'scare', 'potential', 'could', 'have', 'Cats', 'being', 'big', 'part', 'horror', 'aspect', 'was', 'culprit', 'However', 'little', 'girl', 'haunting', 'So-yeon', 'did', 'add', 'spice', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'as', 'well', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'Dark', 'Water', 'mind', 'story', 'also', 'haunting', 'little', 'girl', 'was', 'lot', 'scarier', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'not', 'mistaken', 'Cat', 'may', 'have', 'borrowed', 'few', 'ideas', 'Dark', 'Water', 'was', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Dark', 'Water', 'end.In', 'addition', 'mystery', 'little', 'girl', 'was', 'rather', 'weak', 'opinion', 'get', 'shoved', 'near', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'conveinently', 'tie', 'things', 'up', 'Almost', 'film', 'was', 'deciding', 'horror', 'aspect', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'cats', 'little', 'girl', 'got', 'everything', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'blow', 'water', 'was', 'very', 'run', 'mill.On', 'up', 'side', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'factors', 'film', 'So-yoen', 'claustrophobia', 'role', 'encounters', 'more', 'terror', 'also', 'liked', 'back', 'story', 'friend', 'boyfriend', 'ex', 'helped', 'bring', 'little', 'more', 'drama', 'situation', 'helped', 'set', 'tone', 'type', 'person', 'So-yeon', 'was', 'Basically', 'gentle', 'woman', 'who', 'big', 'heart', 'people', 'animals', 'alike', 'particularly', 'cats', 'was', 'contrast', 'many', 'people', 'came', 'film', 'also', 'complaint', 'seemed', 'contrast', 'was', 'just', 'excuse', 'create', 'more', 'targets', 'haunting', 'least', 'way', 'came', 'me.In', 'case', 'film', 'Korean', 'only', 'English', 'subtitles', 'other', 'features', 'appear.In', 'end', 'gave', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'was', 'fairly', 'original', 'ideas', 'So-yoen', 'was', 'likeable', 'enough', 'also', 'liked', 'back', 'story', 'friend', 'little', 'love', 'triangle', 'created', 'love', 'triangle', 'cut', 'short', 'opinion', 'due', 'film', 'trying', 'push', 'more', 'horror', 'viewer', 'was', 'mixed', 'bag', 'me.Also', 'here', 'slight', 'warning', 'note', 'like', 'cats', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'avid', 'cat', 'lovers', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'forgiving', 'cats', 'are', 'cat', 'lover', 'might', 'heighten', 'creepiness', 'factor', 'never', 'know', 'people', 'are', 'different', 'Not', 'terrible', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'either', 'decent', 'rental', 'best', 'probably', 'not', 'keeper', 'most']",The Cat
