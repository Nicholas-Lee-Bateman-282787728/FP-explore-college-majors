676016,A1B9UU4O3SZ7C6,B00005QW5Y,A Customer,"[98, 99]","Three hours is not enough for a film adaptation to do justice to a book that is the size and length of a textbook.The book is massively rich with characters that are diverse and colorful.  I'm sure fans of the book will agree with that.  The problem with the movie is that if the goal of the movie is to please fans of the book, the series must run for more than 183 minutes.I was very happy with the adaptation's attention to detail of physical appearances when it came to casting.  Morgaine and Viviane are alike in appearance with their faery-like features and dark hair, Igranne and Morgause are the redhead beauties, and Gwenhywfar is the dulcet blonde.  The actresses, to say the least, were stunning and dominated the performances, as it should have been, since Mists of Avalon is a retelling through the female perspective.The movie goes into great length to remain faithful to Morgaine's childhood, up till her reunion with Arthur in Camelot after he is crowned High King.  That is where the chopping begins.  Bits from the story are cut, then large portions.  By the end, it seems altogether rushed.  Morgaine goes straight from Wales after Urien's death to the demise of Camelot.  There is no Nimue, no Kevin, and she doesn't even assume the position of Lady of the Lake.  Sadly, the movie overlooks pretty much the entire last half of the book, which is vital to Morgaine's growth.In the book, we see Morgaine as a precocious youth filled with much knowledge but lacking in wisdom, as is appropriate for her age.  We see she brings about much of her own suffering.  She despises Viviane for her wrongdoings, but after ascending to the throne of Avalon, Morgaine does very much the same as her predecessor.  Morgaine and Viviane's downfall is their pride and their tragedy is that they did the best they could at the time.  The beauty of the story is the overall message, that what we do as individuals affect everybody, and repercussions are felt throughout ones lifetime, and growing and maturing involves sorrow and regret.  This beauty is not achieved nor attempted to be portrayed, not even remotely close, in the movie.What I liked about the book's ending is that Marion Zimmer Bradley didn't leave a feeling of emptiness.  Although everybody around her had moved on or died, Morgaine was still of Avalon.  After time, Morgaine became synonymous with Avalon.  In the movie, however, Avalon has fully retreated into the mist and was cut off, even from Morgaine.  The conclusion of the film left a feeling of emptiness and hallowness.In short, the movie does little to cover the actual growth of the protagonist.  You see her grow from child to maiden, but little is shown to help us shift our view of her from maiden to woman.  Nothing is portrayed to propel her growth further to the elder wise woman she ultimately became in the novel.  Relationships are carried all throughout the novel, and when the story is cropped, much is missing that helps not only Morgaine, but all the characters grow.  Like I said, 183 minutes was just not enough to faithfully portray Morgaine's life and the relationships between characters.There is little negative emotion in the movie aside from Gwenhwyfar's disdain for the old religion and for Morgaine.  Morgaine's indignant pride and her jealousy for Gwenhwyfar (and vice versa) aren't shown much at all.  Morgaine's only real negative reaction in this film is her fury towards Viviane.  Morgaine is stubborn because of her pride and sometimes, jealousy, but without those emotions portrayed to explain her behavior, she comes off sometimes as a comatose pawn, as she often did in the movie (although it was no fault of the actress- Julianna Margulies was superb- but the script).I was touched by some scenes in the movie- the parting of young Arthur and Morgaine, Morgaine's reunion with her mother in the river, and Viviane's death.  The first half of the movie was nicely done, and the rest was so-so.I think in this case, time constraints did the movie in.  Without the additional plot, Morgaine comes off as meek because she observed more than she spoke, and without the story intact you don't get to see what she's done with what she's observed.  Morgaine is portrayed as a complete and utter victim of circumstance, when in fact she played people around, as well.  There was plenty of court schemes and manipulation rampant in the novel, yet the movie only fully captures the mysticism of the old faith and the religious conflict.  Whereas the story consists of characters who fight for a higher cause and for selfish causes, the movie fails to depict the latter.However, if you're like me and you love period films in part because of costumes and scenery, I'd recommend picking this up.  Costumes are beautiful, the music is lovely and very befitting, and if you enjoy Celtic mysticism, you'll like this.  If you've also never read the novel but are interested in seeing the King Arthur legend retold through a female perspective, give this movie a go.  It might interest you in picking up the novel after you've finished watching it.All in all, The Mists of Avalon film adaptation gets 3 stars.  2 for content and 1 for imagery.  I was left dissatisfied after viewing it, but not wholly disappointed.  It would have been lovely if another 2 hours were given to it to more fully explore the richness and cover the growth of the characters.  Despite the flaws, I bought the DVD even after seeing it on TNT.  Imagery was this movie's strong point, and I still pop the DVD into the player from time to time to look at costumes and scenery.  It's quite fun to watch one of your favorite books come to life in such a fantastic way (as far as imagery goes).  Regardless of plot, it's still a feast for the eyes.",3,time constraints stifled the possibilities,1026345600,"07 11, 2002",2002,5766,"['Three', 'hours', 'not', 'enough', 'film', 'adaptation', 'do',

676019,AJPNK5C4L91MM,B00005QW5Y,"A. K. Berger ""filburt_girl""","[6, 7]","The miniseries The Mists of Avalon is such a stark constrast to the novel it is based on, I seriously wonder why they bothered to title the two works the same thing.As those who have read it know, The Mists of Avalon is a fresh, startling interpretation of the classic Arthurian legend.  It centers around the women that shaped the legend. It shows how truly powerful they were through a superior plotline.Nearly every single crucial element to the plot was left out of the miniseries. It dwelled for a horribly long time on the most trivial things, yet neglected to mention some of the most important aspects. For example, the affair between Lancelet and Morgaine, a driving force behind much of the novel version, was only casually mentioned in the miniseries. How Arthur obtained the sword from the stone, which comprises a mere paragrah of the novel, is a fifteen-minute long sequence in the series. Through this misinterpretation, The Mists of Avalon becomes yet another mediocre verion of a classic legend.Despite its inaccuracy to the book, the miniseries DOES have some redeeming qualities. The acting is very good; I cannot think of an instance of bad acting. The physical appearance of the characters is far from glamourous; their messy hair and tattered clothes are extremely realistic (no glossed-over Hollywood fluff in THIS series). However, this detailed, three-hour long film is NOT meant to be watched in a single sitting. The insanely slow plot is maddening. I found myself wanting to hit the fast-foward button more times than one.The horrible misinterpretation of the novel and yawn-worthy course of action cannot really compensate for the impressive acting and costumes that grace The Mists of Avalon.I highly recommend the 800-page novel over the 3-hour long miniseries.",2,"If you liked the book, you WON'T like this",1014508800,"02 24, 2002",2002,1792,"['miniseries', 'Mists', 'Avalon', 'such', 'stark', 'constrast', 'novel', 'based', 'seriously', 'wonder', 'why', 'bothered', 'title', 'two', 'same', 'thing.As', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'know', 'Mists', 'Avalon', 'fresh', 'startling', 'interpretation', 'classic', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'women', 'shaped', 'legend', 'how', 'truly', 'powerful', 'were', 'superior', 'plotline.Nearly', 'single', 'crucial', 'element', 'plot', 'was', 'left', 'miniseries', 'dwelled', 'horribly', 'long', 'time', 'most', 'trivial', 'things', 'yet', 'neglected', 'mention', 'most', 'important', 'aspects', 'example', 'affair', 'Lancelet', 'Morgaine', 'driving', 'force', 'much', 'novel', 'version', 'was', 'only', 'casually', 'mentioned', 'miniseries', 'How', 'Arthur', 'obtained', 'sword', 'stone', 'mere', 'paragrah', 'novel', 'fifteen-minute', 'long', 'sequence', 'series', 'misinterpretation', 'Mists', 'Avalon', 'yet', 'mediocre', 'verion', 'classic', 'legend.Despite', 'inaccuracy', 'book', 'miniseries', 'DOES', 'have', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'instance', 'bad', 'acting', 'physical', 'appearance', 'characters', 'far', 'glamourous', 'messy', 'hair', 'tattered', 'clothes', 'are', 'extremely', 'realistic', 'glossed-over', 'Hollywood', 'fluff', 'THIS', 'series', 'However', 'detailed', 'three-hour', 'long', 'film', 'NOT', 'meant', 'be', 'watched', 'single', 'sitting', 'insanely', 'slow', 'plot', 'maddening', 'found', 'wanting', 'hit', 'fast-foward', 'button', 'more', 'times', 'one.The', 'horrible', 'misinterpretation', 'novel', 'yawn-worthy', 'course', 'action', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'compensate', 'impressive', 'acting', 'costumes', 'grace', 'Mists', 'Avalon.I', 'highly', 'recommend', '800-page', 'novel', '3-hour', 'long', 'miniseries']",The Mists of Avalon

None of the actors are famous, but they are well cast and do an excellent job of bringing this enormously complicated story to life. Now when I go back to read the book again, I will have faces to populate it for me.The story is the traditional Arthurian legend told from the point of view of his pagan sister, whom we call Morgan le Fay and whom Bradley calls Morgaine. It would not surprise me in the least if Bradley had it right, in that she is a scholar of Celtic and other ancient cultures of the British Isles. As most of us realize, the Arthurian story sits on that borderline between fiction and fact, between myth and history.Viviane (Anjelica Huston) is the high priestess of Avalon, an island that exists in some middle world through the mists near Glastonbury. Her underlying plan is to join the powers of the Druids to those of the Christian church, and thereby unite Britain under a specially nurtured king. That king, of course, is Arthur. Morgaine, his half-sister due to a relationship engineered by Viviane, is taken to Avalon to learn to be a priestess of the Druidic Goddess. Arthur is taken away by Merlin to be raised by his other aunt.I'm terribly glad that the special features of the DVD include a family tree arrangement of the characters, as it is enormously complicated. At times it seems that everyone is in love with everyone else, and mostly near relatives. That most of these loves are engineered by Viviane in the name of the Goddess is clear enough, but exactly what she is up to it far less clear.If anything, the end of this story should be a warning to those who are involved in magic that it does not pay to interfere in other people's lives and expect things to go as you planned. I'll say no more about the plot, because it really is unique and deserves to tell its own story.The landscapes, costumes, settings and events (the Beltaine ritual being a high point) are magnificent and, as far as I know, pretty authentic to historical concepts. There's plenty of romance, battling, emotional upheavals, and details of who is lusting after whom to fill the three hours the movie takes. I cannot remember a single minute I would consider dull or irrelevant to the progress of the story.",4,"If You Read the Book, You'll Love the Movie",1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,2427,"['been', 'so', 'long', 'read', 'book', 'probably', 'time', 'do', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'well', 'details', 'stick', 'original', 'overall', 'tone', 'clearly', 'what', 'Marion', 'Zimmer', 'Bradley', 'had', 'mind', 'None', 'actors', 'are', 'famous', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'enormously', 'complicated', 'story', 'life', 'Now', 'when', 'go', 'back', 'read', 'book', 'again', 'will', 'have', 'populate', 'me.The', 'story', 'traditional', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'pagan', 'sister', 'whom', 'call', 'Morgan', 'le', 'Fay', 'whom', 'Bradley', 'Morgaine', 'would', 'not', 'surprise', 'least', 'Bradley', 'had', 'right', 'scholar', 'Celtic', 'other', 'ancient', 'cultures', 'British', 'Isles', 'most', 'realize', 'Arthurian', 'story', 'sits', 'borderline', 'fiction', 'fact', 'myth', 'history.Viviane', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'high', 'priestess', 'Avalon', 'island', 'middle', 'world', 'mists', 'Glastonbury', 'underlying', 'plan', 'join', 'powers', 'Druids', 'Christian', 'church', 'thereby', 'unite', 'Britain', 'specially', 'nurtured', 'king', 'king', 'course', 'Arthur', 'Morgaine', 'half-sister', 'due', 'relationship', 'engineered', 'Viviane', 'taken', 'Avalon', 'learn', 'be', 'priestess', 'Druidic', 'Goddess', 'Arthur', 'taken', 'away', 'Merlin', 'be', 'raised', 'other', 'aunt.I', ""'m"", 'terribly', 'glad', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'include', 'family', 'tree', 'arrangement', 'characters', 'enormously', 'complicated', 'times', 'everyone', 'love', 'everyone', 'else', 'mostly', 'relatives', 'most', 'loves', 'are', 'engineered', 'Viviane', 'name', 'Goddess', 'clear', 'enough', 'exactly', 'what', 'up', 'far', 'less', 'clear.If', 'anything', 'end', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'warning', 'who', 'are', 'involved', 'magic', 'not', 'pay', 'interfere', 'other', 'people', 'lives', 'expect', 'things', 'go', 'planned', ""'ll"", 'say', 'no', 'more', 'plot', 'really', 'unique', 'tell', 'own', 'story.The', 'landscapes', 'costumes', 'settings', 'events', 'Beltaine', 'ritual', 'being', 'high', 'point', 'are', 'magnificent', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'pretty', 'authentic', 'historical', 'concepts', 'plenty', 'romance', 'battling', 'emotional', 'upheavals', 'details', 'who', 'lusting', 'whom', 'fill', 'three', 'hours', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'single', 'minute', 'would', 'consider', 'dull', 'irrelevant', 'progress', 'story']",The Mists of Avalon
676029,A1BFP8YENGNN2H,B00005QW5Y,Becky B,"[3, 4]","I think my problem with this miniseries adaptation mainly comes out of the fact that The Mists of Avalon is my favorite book.  I've read it at least 3 times.  The first time I read it was in 8th grade, and I loved it then, and I still love it now.  You can imagine my excitement when I found out they were making a movie--no, even better--a miniseries out of it.  I always dreamed of seeing this story told on some sort of screen.  Finally that dream was coming true.Unfortunately, my high hopes were not lived up to.  I could make a list of reasons why I didn't like this, but I'll try to limit myself to the 1000 word limit of these reviews.  First of all, the choice of actress for the character of Morgaine didn't exactly fit my picture of her.  According to the book, she's supposed to be small and not very beautiful.  Sorry, Juliana Margulies, but I don't see you as small or ugly.  Secondly, in this miniseries, the names were changed.  Usually something this seemingly small wouldn't bother me, but... well, in the book his name wasn't &quot;Lancelot,&quot; it was &quot;Lancelet,&quot; and even then, it wasn't the name assigned to that character when we first met him in the book.This book left out huge parts of the plot and ran too quickly through the parts it did cover.  There wasn't enough time to learn all the detailed interactions between characters.  When I watched it on television, it was only 2 two-hour episodes.  It should have been at least four to cover everything in the book.  So much was left out that it was hardly the same story.  The whole character of Marion Zimmer Bradley's book was not captured in this movie.  It's not there at all, and I was hugely disappointed.",1,Should this have been painful?,1018915200,"04 16, 2002",2002,1701,"['think', 'problem', 'miniseries', 'adaptation', 'mainly', 'fact', 'Mists', 'Avalon', 'favorite', 'book', ""'ve"", 'read', 'least', '3', 'times', 'first', 'time', 'read', 'was', '8th', 'grade', 'loved', 'then', 'still', 'love', 'now', 'can', 'imagine', 'excitement', 'when', 'found', 'were', 'making', 'movie', 'even', 'better', 'miniseries', 'always', 'dreamed', 'seeing', 'story', 'told', 'sort', 'screen', 'Finally', 'dream', 'was', 'coming', 'true.Unfortunately', 'high', 'hopes', 'were', 'not', 'lived', 'up', 'could', 'make', 'list', 'reasons', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', ""'ll"", 'try', 'limit', '1000', 'word', 'limit', 'reviews', 'First', 'all', 'choice', 'actress', 'character', 'Morgaine', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'fit', 'picture', 'According', 'book', 'supposed', 'be', 'small', 'not', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Sorry', 'Juliana', 'Margulies', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'small', 'ugly', 'Secondly', 'miniseries', 'names', 'were', 'changed', 'Usually', 'something', 'seemingly', 'small', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother', 'well', 'book', 'name', 'was', ""n't"", 'quot', 'Lancelot', 'quot', 'was', 'quot', 'Lancelet', 'quot', 'even', 'then', 'was', ""n't"", 'name', 'assigned', 'character', 'when', 'first', 'met', 'book.This', 'book', 'left', 'out', 'huge', 'parts', 'plot', 'ran', 'too', 'quickly', 'parts', 'did', 'cover', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'learn', 'detailed', 'interactions', 'characters', 'When', 'watched', 'television', 'was', 'only', '2', 'two-hour', 'episodes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'four', 'cover', 'everything', 'book', 'So', 'much', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'was', 'hardly', 'same', 'story', 'whole', 'character', 'Marion', 'Zimmer', 'Bradley', 'book', 'was', 'not', 'captured', 'movie', 'not', 'there', 'was', 'hugely', 'disappointed']",The Mists of Avalon

Von Behren ""reneofc""","[6, 7]","If I hadn't read Marion Zimmer Bradely's ""Mists of Avalon"" upon which this mini-series was based, I sincerely would have liked this 4 hour presentation.  But having read and thoroughly enjoyed the novel, I can only say that there is no way that 4 hours could have every successfully relayed all the nuance of Ms Bradley's genius.  If you have read the book, you will find the film lacking even though many of the actors do a fine job.  Julianna Margulies portrays Morgaine adequately, while Joan Allen as Morgause does a superb job although at times can be a tad bit too sinister---due again to the compact format of the film version which does not give her enough dialogue to be sinister and subtle at the same time.  Angelica Houston, as Viviane, the lady of the lake, I believe was miscast---she conveys power, but none of the softness and reluctance that Zimmer Bradley's north country girl displayed in the novel.  Caroline Goodal's performance is perfect as the aging Ygraine, but her younger portrayal lacks the spark and with of the Ygraine depicted in the story.  Alas so many of the novel's most wonderful characters are omitted for the sake of brevity---what a loss!  What a truely vibrant panaroma of personalities this film could have depicted.Bottom line:  this film is the novel in its weakest most diluted format.  The actors don't have enough material to give fully fleshed out and nuanced performances worthy of the characters developed in the novel.

And those were wonderfully redeeming qualities to the book by Marion Zimmer Bradley, of which this DVD is based.  But where Bradley made the legend come alive again in a new way, the movie does almost nothing of the sort.  True, the focus is shifted away from Arthur, Lancelot, and Guenevere, but the motivations of the characters are not portrayed with the fascinating depth and sense of compelling urgency of the book.  Instead, the movie plods--peculiar in that so much of Bradley's plotting was left out.  What remains is a mediocre spectacle--not bad, but with little of the power it could have had.  Occasional scenes work well, the costumes are rich but for the most part not wildly original, the music workable but rarely gripping, acting never over the top but seldom if ever inspired.  Two exceptions bear mention.  The first is the Beltane ritual, in which Arthur unknowingly impregnates his sister--the visual look of that scene, with costumes and body art, was terrific.  And some of the percussive music of the latter Beltane ritual was quite dramatic and catching.  But that's little enough to recommend.  Instead, watch Excalibur for a better vision on film of the Arthurian legend, or read Marion Zimmer Bradley's excellent book.",3,Sadly Lacking,1042329600,"01 12, 2003",2003,1297,"['Revisionist', 'Absolutely', 'Feminist', 'Definitely', 'were', 'wonderfully', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'book', 'Marion', 'Zimmer', 'Bradley', 'DVD', 'based', 'where', 'Bradley', 'made', 'legend', 'come', 'alive', 'again', 'new', 'way', 'movie', 'almost', 'nothing', 'sort', 'True', 'focus', 'shifted', 'away', 'Arthur', 'Lancelot', 'Guenevere', 'motivations', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'portrayed', 'fascinating', 'depth', 'sense', 'compelling', 'urgency', 'book', 'Instead', 'movie', 'plods', 'peculiar', 'so', 'much', 'Bradley', 'plotting', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'What', 'mediocre', 'spectacle', 'not', 'bad', 'little', 'power', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'Occasional', 'scenes', 'work', 'well', 'costumes', 'are', 'rich', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'wildly', 'original', 'music', 'workable', 'rarely', 'gripping', 'acting', 'never', 'top', 'seldom', 'ever', 'inspired', 'Two', 'exceptions', 'mention', 'first', 'Beltane', 'ritual', 'Arthur', 'unknowingly', 'sister', 'visual', 'look', 'scene', 'costumes', 'body', 'art', 'was', 'terrific', 'percussive', 'music', 'latter', 'Beltane', 'ritual', 'was', 'quite', 'dramatic', 'catching', 'little', 'enough', 'recommend', 'Instead', 'watch', 'Excalibur', 'better', 'vision', 'film', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'read', 'Marion', 'Zimmer', 'Bradley', 'excellent', 'book']",The Mists of Avalon

However, in toying with the fates of mankind, she unwittingly changes the course of history and of her nation's destiny.  Intelligently acted with smart, crackling dialogue, MISTS tells the entire story of Arthur, from his planned birth up until his inevitable end with the return of the sword Excalibur as an offering to the mists.This DVD release of the miniseries is edited seamlessly into one epic three-hour tale with only a handful of the commercial break 'black-outs' remaining.  The sound is Dolby Surround, and the transfer is absolutely stunning (listen for the effects especially in the action sequences).  The disc, as well, contains extras including additional scenes not shown in the televised version, a gallery of photos, an assortment of the prepared storyboards, photographs of the costume and production designs, and even a family tree tracing Arthur and Morgaine's lineage.A must for any fan of King Arthur tales and certainly enjoyable for any TV addict.",5,Arthur At His Best ...

676046,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B00005QW5Y,Enjolras,"[0, 0]","The legend of King Arthur has gone through many, many permutations. The Mists of Avalon is probably one of the more unique. It tells the tale of Arthur through the point of view of the female characters. Overall, this movie works far better than most fantasy movies - certainly better than the current fantasy hit Game of Thrones.The characters in this movie are complex and rich - or at least the female ones. Unlike most incarnations of Camelot, none of the female characters are one-dimensional. We see them suffer and cry, but we also see their strength. They're not whiners. Some of the women use sex as a tool of influence, but they never come across as whores. The actresses do a capable job portraying their characters, something that can't be said of all TV movies.That said, the men are inherently less interesting. Arthur is a bit too callow. We barely meet the famous Merlin before he dies. Lancelot is eye candy. We don't get to know the other Knights of the Round Table at all. Mordred shows some complexity, but his character is sometimes overacted. I wouldn't say this undermines the movie too much, but it would have been nice if the movie spent a bit more time developing the male characters. Then again, at 3 hours long, this movie is already quite long.It's worth noting how this movie uses sex. With so many strong female characters, sex inevitably comes up. This isn't a family friendly version of King Arthur. However, unlike, say, Game of Thrones, Mists of Avalon uses sex artistically, not crudely. The sex scenes are subtle but filled with emotion. I commend the director for smart choices.My biggest critique of the film is that it doesn't have a well defined plot. The movie follows characters, not a story. I think it works, but it would have been nice to have had some sort of goal or threat giving some shape to the story. Viewers accustomed to action films will find Mists of Avalon boring.Overall, I definitely recommend this movie for fans of fantasy movies. It probably has less resonance for viewers who aren't intimately familiar with Arthurian legend, but still has a lot for viewers who appreciate character development.",4,Camelot as you've never seen it before,1344988800,"08 15, 2012",2012,2159,"['legend', 'King', 'Arthur', 'gone', 'many', 'many', 'permutations', 'Mists', 'Avalon', 'probably', 'one', 'more', 'unique', 'tale', 'Arthur', 'point', 'view', 'female', 'characters', 'Overall', 'movie', 'far', 'better', 'most', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'certainly', 'better', 'current', 'fantasy', 'hit', 'Game', 'Thrones.The', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'complex', 'rich', 'least', 'female', 'ones', 'most', 'incarnations', 'Camelot', 'none', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'one-dimensional', 'see', 'suffer', 'cry', 'also', 'see', 'strength', ""'re"", 'not', 'whiners', 'women', 'use', 'sex', 'tool', 'influence', 'never', 'come', 'whores', 'actresses', 'do', 'capable', 'job', 'portraying', 'characters', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'TV', 'movies.That', 'said', 'men', 'are', 'inherently', 'less', 'interesting', 'Arthur', 'bit', 'too', 'callow', 'barely', 'meet', 'famous', 'Merlin', 'Lancelot', 'eye', 'candy', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'other', 'Knights', 'Round', 'Table', 'Mordred', 'complexity', 'character', 'sometimes', 'overacted', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'movie', 'spent', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'developing', 'male', 'characters', 'Then', 'again', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'movie', 'already', 'quite', 'long.It', 'worth', 'noting', 'how', 'movie', 'sex', 'so', 'many', 'strong', 'female', 'characters', 'sex', 'inevitably', 'up', ""n't"", 'family', 'friendly', 'version', 'King', 'Arthur', 'However', 'say', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'Mists', 'Avalon', 'sex', 'artistically', 'not', 'crudely', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'subtle', 'filled', 'emotion', 'commend', 'director', 'smart', 'choices.My', 'biggest', 'critique', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'well', 'defined', 'plot', 'movie', 'characters', 'not', 'story', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'had', 'sort', 'goal', 'threat', 'giving', 'shape', 'story', 'Viewers', 'accustomed', 'action', 'films', 'will', 'find', 'Mists', 'Avalon', 'boring.Overall', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'fans', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'probably', 'less', 'resonance', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'intimately', 'familiar', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'still', 'lot', 'viewers', 'who', 'appreciate', 'character', 'development']",The Mists of Avalon

Unlike many versions , she is given a sympathetic portrayal here. She is determined to preserve the legacy of Avalon and it's pagan religion , against the growing Christian faith.It succeeds in capturing the magic of Avalon, the passions and turmoil of the main characters, the wonder that was Celtic Briton and the conflicts between Chritianity and the Ancient Paganism.Brilliant casting and effects. A stunning visual presentation.You will be spellbound by the Celtic magic rights, the visions of Morgaine , the swordplay and battle scenes, and the costumes.Sop poignantly captured are the young Morgaine's (Tamsin Egerton)first vision and the terror she experiencing, her parting from her brother when they are both taken by the high priestess Viviane (Anjelica Huston) from their mother Igraine (Caroline Goodall), Morgaine;s turmoil at finding out the man she made love to as part of the pagan ceremonies organized by Merlin and Viviane was her brother Arthur, the reunion of Morgaine with her mother outside Glastonbury Abby, and the murder by Mordred of Viviane.The evil of the soreceress Morgause (Joan Allen), the villainy of Mordred (Hans Matheson), the majesty of Arthur (Edward Atterton), the gallantry of Lancelot (Michael Vartan) and the turmoil of  Gwenhwyfar (played by the sensual Samantha Mathis) are brilliantly captured.A rewarding  epic movie.",5,Captures the magic of Avalon,1289865600,"11 16, 2010",2010,1841,"['have', 'read', 'amazing', 'sprawling', 'epic', 'Marion', 'Zimmer', 'Bradley', 'movie', 'based.I', 'believe', 'deviations', 'novel', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'avoid', 'given', 'scope', 'novel', 'many', 'characters', 'angles', 'events', 'turns', 'movie', 'most', 'engrossing', 'best', 'movies', 'yet', 'made', 'based', 'Arthurian', 'legend.It', 'centers', 'Morgaine', 'Juliana', 'Margulies-enchanting', 'perfect', 'role', 'Arthur', 'dark', 'bewitching', 'half-sister', 'many', 'versions', 'given', 'sympathetic', 'portrayal', 'here', 'determined', 'preserve', 'legacy', 'Avalon', 'pagan', 'religion', 'growing', 'Christian', 'faith.It', 'capturing', 'magic', 'Avalon', 'passions', 'turmoil', 'main', 'characters', 'wonder', 'was', 'Celtic', 'Briton', 'conflicts', 'Chritianity', 'Ancient', 'Paganism.Brilliant', 'casting', 'effects', 'stunning', 'visual', 'presentation.You', 'will', 'be', 'spellbound', 'Celtic', 'magic', 'rights', 'visions', 'Morgaine', 'swordplay', 'battle', 'scenes', 'costumes.Sop', 'poignantly', 'captured', 'are', 'young', 'Morgaine', 'Tamsin', 'Egerton', 'first', 'vision', 'terror', 'experiencing', 'parting', 'brother', 'when', 'are', 'taken', 'high', 'priestess', 'Viviane', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'mother', 'Igraine', 'Caroline', 'Goodall', 'Morgaine', 's', 'turmoil', 'finding', 'out', 'man', 'made', 'love', 'part', 'pagan', 'ceremonies', 'organized', 'Merlin', 'Viviane', 'was', 'brother', 'Arthur', 'reunion', 'Morgaine', 'mother', 'outside', 'Glastonbury', 'Abby', 'murder', 'Mordred', 'Viviane.The', 'evil', 'soreceress', 'Morgause', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'villainy', 'Mordred', 'Hans', 'Matheson', 'majesty', 'Arthur', 'Edward', 'Atterton', 'gallantry', 'Lancelot', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'turmoil', 'Gwenhwyfar', 'played', 'sensual', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'captured.A', 'rewarding', 'epic', 'movie']",The Mists of Avalon
676051,A1WZ6AS5J9ELUA,B00005QW5Y,Gramma J.,"[5, 5]","I have read ""Mists of Avalon"" almost yearly since it first was published.  I had not seen the movie made from the book, and so, after reading it again this spring decided to treat myself.After watching this DVD I feel the producers and directors took a giant cleaver, chopped Marion Zimmer Bradley's book into pieces, threw the pieces in the air and without reverence or thought pieced them back together again to create a made for television farce.I realize how daunting it might be to put such an epic novel to the television screen, but they might have tried to at least stay true to the story as written!  I do not know what the screen writers hoped to accomplish, or what audience they were writing to capture.I, like the women of Avalon, am a daughter of the Goddess.  And, I was appalled by the treatment given the book from which the movie was made.  The book, ""The Mists of Avalon"", pays homage and tribute to the Goddess, her mysteries and her priestesses.  The movie gives a Disney like feeling to what was written in the book.  No, I think Disney would have been more respectful and true to the written word! In talking with others, of like mind, about the movie we wonder if the screen writers were pandering to a largely fundamental Christian audience and wanted to skirt the more beautiful and devout pagan aspect of the story.I could begin listing inadequacies of this movie as it tries to capture ""The Mists of Avalon"", but they are too many.  The only way this movie is even remotely connected to Marion Zimmer Bradley's book is in the title and the naming of the central characters.  And, even that becomes rather loose and recreated by the screen writer.  Very bothersome was the way the sequence of events, from their childhood to the inevitable conclusion, was seemingly ignored. Events that happen at the beginning were shelved to the end, or completely ignored.  Too many important aspects of the main characters lives were excluded to give any continuity to the story.  I found myself often rewinding and asking ""whaaa"", and not finding the answer, because some vital information had been excluded.The actresses chosen to play the lead women are strong and powerful actors, whom I admire, and they did as well as could be expected with what they were given.  I would have liked to see what such strong women might have done with a screen writer and director who followed the book!  The main male actors were weak and I do not feel they were not given much to work with in the way of character development.  We all have ""pictures"" in our head of the characters in a novel.  These men, for me, were not even close!I have seen mini series made that take weeks to air.  It would have done well to stretch ""The Mists of Avalon"" over many more weeks and present the story as written.All in all, it was a very disappointing movie, because I wanted to SEE ""The Mists of Avalon"" brought to life.  Perhaps another day another director, producer and screen writer will try again and stay true to the written word, and see the beauty of keeping the movie sequentially true to the story.",1,"If you love the book,  forget the movie!",1306454400,"05 27, 2011",2011,3099,"['have', 'read', 'Mists', 'Avalon', 'almost', 'yearly', 'first', 'was', 'published', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'made', 'book', 'so', 'reading', 'again', 'spring', 'decided', 'treat', 'myself.After', 'watching', 'DVD', 'feel', 'producers', 'directors', 'took', 'giant', 'cleaver', 'chopped', 'Marion', 'Zimmer', 'Bradley', 'book', 'pieces', 'threw', 'pieces', 'air', 'reverence', 'thought', 'pieced', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'create', 'made', 'television', 'farce.I', 'realize', 'how', 'daunting', 'might', 'be', 'put', 'epic', 'novel', 'television', 'screen', 'might', 'have', 'tried', 'least', 'stay', 'true', 'story', 'written', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'screen', 'writers', 'hoped', 'accomplish', 'what', 'audience', 'were', 'writing', 'capture.I', 'women', 'Avalon', 'am', 'daughter', 'Goddess', 'was', 'appalled', 'treatment', 'given', 'book', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'book', 'Mists', 'Avalon', 'homage', 'tribute', 'Goddess', 'mysteries', 'priestesses', 'movie', 'Disney', 'feeling', 'what', 'was', 'written', 'book', 'No', 'think', 'Disney', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'respectful', 'true', 'written', 'word', 'talking', 'others', 'mind', 'movie', 'wonder', 'screen', 'writers', 'were', 'pandering', 'largely', 'fundamental', 'Christian', 'audience', 'wanted', 'skirt', 'more', 'beautiful', 'devout', 'pagan', 'aspect', 'story.I', 'could', 'begin', 'listing', 'inadequacies', 'movie', 'capture', 'Mists', 'Avalon', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'only', 'way', 'movie', 'even', 'remotely', 'connected', 'Marion', 'Zimmer', 'Bradley', 'book', 'title', 'naming', 'central', 'characters', 'even', 'rather', 'loose', 'recreated', 'screen', 'writer', 'Very', 'bothersome', 'was', 'way', 'sequence', 'events', 'childhood', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'was', 'seemingly', 'ignored', 'Events', 'happen', 'beginning', 'were', 'shelved', 'end', 'completely', 'ignored', 'Too', 'many', 'important', 'aspects', 'main', 'characters', 'lives', 'were', 'excluded', 'give', 'continuity', 'story', 'found', 'often', 'rewinding', 'asking', 'whaaa', 'not', 'finding', 'answer', 'vital', 'information', 'had', 'been', 'excluded.The', 'actresses', 'chosen', 'play', 'lead', 'women', 'are', 'strong', 'powerful', 'actors', 'whom', 'admire', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'what', 'were', 'given', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'what', 'such', 'strong', 'women', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'screen', 'writer', 'director', 'who', 'followed', 'book', 'main', 'male', 'actors', 'were', 'weak', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'were', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'work', 'way', 'character', 'development', 'have', 'pictures', 'head', 'characters', 'novel', 'men', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'have', 'seen', 'mini', 'series', 'made', 'take', 'weeks', 'air', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'stretch', 'Mists', 'Avalon', 'many', 'more', 'weeks', 'present', 'story', 'written.All', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'wanted', 'SEE', 'Mists', 'Avalon', 'brought', 'life', 'Perhaps', 'day', 'director', 'producer', 'screen', 'writer', 'will', 'try', 'again', 'stay', 'true', 'written', 'word', 'see', 'beauty', 'keeping', 'movie', 'sequentially', 'true', 'story']",The Mists of Avalon

676054,AQZIM4XNOT9YI,B00005QW5Y,Heartland G,"[1, 3]","You know, I loved movie - which I was attracted to when I was younger, trying to escape Christian child/torture/sacrifice/woman-hating stuff I was raised with. I was thrilled with the Goddess themes which was like medicine for a young woman being insulted and abused by male supremacists for a long while. I wonder sometimes if we escape one predator wolves to fall into the hands of predatory bears however.As a story or fantasy it's lovely - high adventure, the magic, priestesses of Avalon, sisterhood of Goddess worshippers - fighting for power while threatened by a male-dominated, aggressive Christian take-over, seemingly a dream come true for a secret Goddess worshipper. As I've gotten older and seen horrific abuses of women, children, animals in both pagan, Christian and many religious traditions I become more leary and horrified by religion each passing year. Jonestown, my own suffering at the hands of Christians, education about many religious animal torture and human sacrificial rituals worldwide has just turned me off big time. While I still love this story for Deep Play and fantasy, there's an element to it that repels me and that's the scene where Morgaine is tricked into a religious ceremony where she is to have sex with the ""stag King"" - not only do they kill a stag - symbolic of killing everything that's ""dear"" to you - deer, get it (as well as dear to the deer!)? They also kill all that's dear to our heroine, because they trick her into having sex with her own brother! Which not only amounts to rape, but is a trauma she'll probably never get over. It has come to my attention that many religions are abusing children's trust in horrific manners in real life and we need to really check this cruelty. Emotional and mental torture and anguish is some of the worst you can go through. To have your own sisters and mother harm you this way is..... I don't know that it's possible to get over it. It's child abuse at it's worst. Though Morgaine is of age at this point, she is still in these women's trust. I've had something similar happen to me and we must fight religion used as physical, mental or emotional abuse. You can't imagine the anguish, it's indescribable. Secret sects, religious groups etc... all are potential predators no different from rapists or child predators. I really wish that religion could be regulated in terms of regulating breaking laws with religious excuses which seems to be the case in many religions - strange how what's against the law, suddenly becomes acceptable in a religion, like child abuse, rape etc...Having said that, this story, purely for entertainment or pretend is still one of my all time favorites, unlike a lot of readers I liked the movie adaptation, I thought Morgaine was beautiful, Angelica Houston was really good in her role, and all the sisters were good. The costumes were great, a scene or two specifically on Avalon itself could've been better designed set-wise, special effects, etc....  but all in all. The music was well chosen and I enjoyed the experience of watching it. Occasionally it has the cheesy feel of old sword and sorcery movies, but the scenes with the sisters and mother make up for it. The music is haunting and beautiful. The magical elements of aspects of animism, moral truths in nature etc.... although the worship of predators is always inherently immoral, tribal religious people have always tried to sort out reality by sorting out and deifying/copying natural elements. It's natural for primates to learn this way, because we are natural mimics. I hope we can grow beyond this because Nature is actually less a mother and more a brutal pyramid scheme of predation. I also have doubts to whether, you can choose conveniently between cruelty and kindness whenever it suits you. I hated when one priestess succumbed and became a nun at the end of the movie, but probably realistic. It was done poetically though, with a sad melancholy at the loss of the ""Old Ways."" They're not really lost however, people still practice all sorts of religious freedoms and usually go underground when Christians begin to torture them etc...",4,Reservations but good,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,4140,"['know', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'attracted', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'trying', 'escape', 'Christian', 'child/torture/sacrifice/woman-hating', 'stuff', 'was', 'raised', 'was', 'thrilled', 'Goddess', 'themes', 'was', 'medicine', 'young', 'woman', 'being', 'insulted', 'abused', 'male', 'supremacists', 'long', 'while', 'wonder', 'sometimes', 'escape', 'one', 'predator', 'fall', 'hands', 'predatory', 'bears', 'however.As', 'story', 'fantasy', 'lovely', 'high', 'adventure', 'magic', 'priestesses', 'Avalon', 'sisterhood', 'Goddess', 'worshippers', 'fighting', 'power', 'threatened', 'male-dominated', 'aggressive', 'Christian', 'take-over', 'seemingly', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'secret', 'Goddess', 'worshipper', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'older', 'seen', 'horrific', 'abuses', 'women', 'children', 'animals', 'pagan', 'Christian', 'many', 'religious', 'traditions', 'become', 'more', 'leary', 'horrified', 'religion', 'passing', 'year', 'Jonestown', 'own', 'suffering', 'hands', 'Christians', 'education', 'many', 'religious', 'animal', 'torture', 'human', 'sacrificial', 'rituals', 'just', 'turned', 'big', 'time', 'still', 'love', 'story', 'Deep', 'Play', 'fantasy', 'element', 'scene', 'where', 'Morgaine', 'tricked', 'religious', 'ceremony', 'where', 'have', 'sex', 'stag', 'King', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'kill', 'stag', 'symbolic', 'killing', 'everything', 'dear', 'deer', 'get', 'as', 'well', 'dear', 'deer', 'also', 'kill', 'dear', 'heroine', 'trick', 'having', 'sex', 'own', 'brother', 'Which', 'not', 'only', 'rape', 'trauma', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'never', 'get', 'come', 'attention', 'many', 'religions', 'are', 'abusing', 'children', 'trust', 'horrific', 'manners', 'real', 'life', 'need', 'really', 'check', 'cruelty', 'Emotional', 'mental', 'torture', 'anguish', 'worst', 'can', 'go', 'through', 'have', 'own', 'sisters', 'harm', 'way', '..', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'possible', 'get', 'child', 'abuse', 'worst', 'Morgaine', 'age', 'point', 'still', 'women', 'trust', ""'ve"", 'had', 'something', 'similar', 'happen', 'must', 'fight', 'religion', 'used', 'physical', 'mental', 'emotional', 'abuse', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anguish', 'indescribable', 'Secret', 'sects', 'religious', 'groups', 'etc', 'are', 'potential', 'predators', 'different', 'rapists', 'child', 'predators', 'really', 'wish', 'religion', 'could', 'be', 'regulated', 'terms', 'regulating', 'breaking', 'laws', 'religious', 'excuses', 'be', 'case', 'many', 'religions', 'strange', 'how', 'what', 'law', 'suddenly', 'acceptable', 'religion', 'child', 'abuse', 'rape', 'etc', 'Having', 'said', 'story', 'purely', 'entertainment', 'pretend', 'still', 'one', 'time', 'favorites', 'lot', 'readers', 'liked', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'thought', 'Morgaine', 'was', 'beautiful', 'Angelica', 'Houston', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'role', 'sisters', 'were', 'good', 'costumes', 'were', 'great', 'scene', 'two', 'specifically', 'Avalon', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'designed', 'set-wise', 'special', 'effects', 'etc', 'music', 'was', 'well', 'chosen', 'enjoyed', 'experience', 'watching', 'Occasionally', 'cheesy', 'feel', 'old', 'sword', 'sorcery', 'movies', 'scenes', 'sisters', 'mother', 'make', 'up', 'music', 'haunting', 'beautiful', 'magical', 'elements', 'aspects', 'animism', 'moral', 'truths', 'nature', 'etc', 'worship', 'predators', 'always', 'inherently', 'immoral', 'tribal', 'religious', 'people', 'have', 'always', 'tried', 'sort', 'out', 'reality', 'sorting', 'out', 'deifying/copying', 'natural', 'elements', 'natural', 'primates', 'learn', 'way', 'are', 'natural', 'mimics', 'hope', 'can', 'grow', 'Nature', 'actually', 'less', 'mother', 'more', 'brutal', 'pyramid', 'scheme', 'predation', 'also', 'have', 'doubts', 'can', 'choose', 'conveniently', 'cruelty', 'kindness', 'whenever', 'suits', 'hated', 'when', 'one', 'priestess', 'succumbed', 'became', 'nun', 'end', 'movie', 'probably', 'realistic', 'was', 'done', 'poetically', 'sad', 'melancholy', 'loss', 'Old', 'Ways', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'lost', 'however', 'people', 'still', 'practice', 'sorts', 'religious', 'freedoms', 'usually', 'go', 'underground', 'when', 'Christians', 'begin', 'torture', 'etc']",The Mists of Avalon

No.  But I was looking for at least a majority of the storyline to match up.  That's not what I got.Okay, here we go - my breakdown of good and bad and all that jazz:&lt;SPOILER WARNING>1)  Time constraints - if this series had been given 2 more nights, perhaps things that were done TO the text would have been much improved.  I can respect that having only 4 hours to fit in a bazillion pages of book is difficult (thus the 2 star rating and not the 1).  Do I like what they did with those 4 hours?  No, but I can respect that it made things difficult.2)  Viviane's/Morgause's death - LAME.  LAME LAME LAME.  Morgause doesn't even DIE in the book.  STUPID AND NEEDLESS. Again, for time constraint reasons I can see why they would kill Viviane that way (Balin and Balan weren't huge enough characters to constitue devoting time to them), however, the Morgause thing was inexcusable.3)  Uther's Death - Cheesy.  Melodramatic cliche.  Needless adaptation of the script to try and cater to an audience looking more for General Hospital than the Mists of Avalon.4)  Casting - Lancelot is supposed to be this handsome God among men.  He wasn't.  At all.  Arthur was supposed to be charismatic and likable.  The actor portrays him as a gutless, sniveling little pained man.  I didn't have too much to say about the rest of the cast, but still . . . considering those guys were two MAJOR players, this was a little bit annoying.5)  Music - Liked it.  Really liked it.  Good picks there.  One of the few things I found truly enjoyable.6)  Mordred - Barely enough time to decide to dislike him.  Very little character development makes him an ineffective bad guy.7)  Merlin/Kevin - very minimal parts.  Kevin wasn't even mentioned.  They were pretty important to the whole legend in general, no?  OKAY, THEN WHERE DID THEY GO?&lt;/SPOILER>I am itching for a new, good Arthurian movie - one that won't make me want to slap people around.  First Knight, Mists of Avalon . . . monstrosities.

676058,AT5SCHXAWHGI6,B00005QW5Y,huiwen86,"[2, 2]","I haven't read the book. I watched this movie without any expectations whatsoever, or any knowledge of the plot. Honestly, I didn't even know it was about the legend of King Arthur.The movie was far better than any of the other Arthur films I have watched. It surpasses Merlin in terms of believability, Camelot in terms of maturity, and almost equals Excalibur. Julienna Marguiles portrays a very convincing Morgaine. The whole story is told from her point of view, and indeed it was a gorgeous retelling. For once, we are given the refreshing view that Morganne was humane, and good. We are given new explanations for the incest between Arthur and Morganne, as well as the blackness of Mordred's character, which is now blamed on Morganne's aunt, Morgause.What intrigued me about the movie was the portrayal of the Pagan and Christian society, and most interestingly, about how the Pagan goddess still lives on as the Virgin Mary (I still find that interesting, although I don't quite agree with it). Certain things, like having Excalibur return to the goddess and fading off into the silhoette of the Christian cross puzzles me a little to what the symbolic meaning behind it implies. This intermingling of both religions - the link established wasn't as clear as it should have been.Beautiful performances from Anjelica Huston (The Lady of the Lake), and Joan Allen (Morgause). I didn't really think that Samantha Mathis was suitable to play Guinevere (she didn't really look the part, nor act the part)... and Michael Vartan surprisingly pulled off the part of Lancelot well (Franco Nero is by far one of the most atrocious Lancelots ever). Hans Matheson (Mordred), a relatively new actor, does a better job here than what he did in Les Miserables.A good cast, and a good movie. I found it a little controversial, and at times slightly disturbing, but it keeps the mystery and intrigue surrounding Avalon as palpable as ever.",4,Enchanting,1089763200,"07 14, 2004",2004,1930,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'watched', 'movie', 'expectations', 'whatsoever', 'knowledge', 'plot', 'Honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'legend', 'King', 'Arthur.The', 'movie', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'other', 'Arthur', 'films', 'have', 'watched', 'Merlin', 'terms', 'believability', 'Camelot', 'terms', 'maturity', 'almost', 'equals', 'Excalibur', 'Julienna', 'Marguiles', 'very', 'convincing', 'Morgaine', 'whole', 'story', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'indeed', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'retelling', 'once', 'are', 'given', 'refreshing', 'view', 'Morganne', 'was', 'humane', 'good', 'are', 'given', 'new', 'explanations', 'incest', 'Arthur', 'Morganne', 'as', 'well', 'blackness', 'Mordred', 'character', 'now', 'blamed', 'Morganne', 'aunt', 'Morgause.What', 'intrigued', 'movie', 'was', 'portrayal', 'Pagan', 'Christian', 'society', 'most', 'interestingly', 'how', 'Pagan', 'goddess', 'still', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'still', 'find', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'agree', 'Certain', 'things', 'having', 'Excalibur', 'return', 'goddess', 'fading', 'off', 'silhoette', 'Christian', 'cross', 'puzzles', 'little', 'what', 'symbolic', 'meaning', 'intermingling', 'religions', 'link', 'established', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'clear', 'should', 'have', 'been.Beautiful', 'performances', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Lady', 'Lake', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'Morgause', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'was', 'suitable', 'play', 'Guinevere', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'part', 'act', 'part', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'surprisingly', 'pulled', 'off', 'part', 'Lancelot', 'well', 'Franco', 'Nero', 'far', 'one', 'most', 'atrocious', 'Lancelots', 'ever', 'Hans', 'Matheson', 'Mordred', 'relatively', 'new', 'actor', 'better', 'job', 'here', 'what', 'did', 'Les', 'Miserables.A', 'good', 'cast', 'good', 'movie', 'found', 'little', 'controversial', 'times', 'slightly', 'disturbing', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'surrounding', 'Avalon', 'as', 'palpable', 'ever']",The Mists of Avalon

Not only do we have this, but also Merlin, Excalibur, Lancelot and Guinevere,Knights of the Round Table, Prince Valiant, Merlin of the Crystal Cave, Quest for Camelot, the awful First Knight and the apparently even worse (and imaginatively titled) King Arthur.Mists of Avalon is the best I've seen so far. After the rather childish Merlin and the just plain weird Excalibur I was pleased that this film was more grown-up and with better characters who you can actually connect with.I've not seen Julianna Margulies in anything else aside from Out for Justice (yay!) and Ghost Ship. But damn, she was totally gorgeous as Morgaine, a character previously portrayed as a villain.Though I have the book by Marion Zimmer Bradley, I have not yet read it (I'll get round to it). But I can tell you now that her version of events tells it from the point of view of the women and how their conspiring and unloyalty brought about the end of Camelot. For a legend with so many incarnations this angle was quite refreshing.It's far from a woman's film though. It does, however, a lot of love story in it. But it's the kind of love story where you know what the characters are thinking and what they feel rather than just something rudely stapled on to appeal to the women.Mists of Avalon is also wonderfully shot and has many scenes of unique atmosphere. All of this, obviously, is backed up by Lee Holdridge's utterly beautiful score. A dozen great themes and moods played out to various emotions. Definitely one of the best scores ever, methinks.Like I have said, there are loads of movies to choose from regarding this legend. But Mists of Avalon is the best I have seen so far.

At 183 minutes, it is too long, and yet the viewer is introduced to the large number of integral characters at a dizzying pace.  It surely would have worked better had it been released as two movies, and the storyline slowed down somewhat.Having said that though, the storyline is certainly exciting and involving.  It is the story of the Court of Camelot and its ties to the mystic isle of Avalon, as recounted by the oft-maligned Morgaine Le Fay.  It is set in ye olde Britain, where Christianity is gaining ascendancy over the ancient druid religion.  In an increasingly desperate effort to keep the old ways alive, Viviane - the Lady of the Lake - shapes the destinies of Morgaine, Arthur, Gwenwyfar, Lancelot and the other familiar characters.  But some of them begin to rebel at being moved around like pieces on a game board.Why, in such a quintessential British story, were so many American actors used?  They either speak painfully slowly in their attempts to sound English, or they use dreadful faux-British accents that frequently slip.  And while Angelica Huston's accent is admirable, she is too strident and not ethereal enough as the Lady of the Lake.  The thoroughly evil Mordred acts entirely with his eyebrows, and there are some abysmal performances in the minor roles.Such a lavish production deserves better.  The sets, scenery, and costumes are visually spectacular, but there are too many annoyances to distract the viewer.  The 'mists' of the title are created through an overindulgence in smoke machines, and perhaps this is symbolic of the fact that in the wrong hands, a good story can become a bad film.",2,&quot;Perhaps people no longer believe in it&quot;,1071273600,"12 13, 2003",2003,1702,"['Mists', 'Avalon', 'good', 'story', 'unfortunately', 'work', '183', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'yet', 'viewer', 'introduced', 'large', 'number', 'integral', 'characters', 'dizzying', 'pace', 'surely', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'two', 'movies', 'storyline', 'slowed', 'down', 'somewhat.Having', 'said', 'storyline', 'certainly', 'exciting', 'involving', 'story', 'Court', 'Camelot', 'ties', 'mystic', 'isle', 'Avalon', 'recounted', 'oft-maligned', 'Morgaine', 'Le', 'Fay', 'set', 'ye', 'olde', 'Britain', 'where', 'Christianity', 'gaining', 'ascendancy', 'ancient', 'druid', 'religion', 'increasingly', 'desperate', 'effort', 'keep', 'old', 'ways', 'alive', 'Viviane', 'Lady', 'Lake', 'destinies', 'Morgaine', 'Arthur', 'Gwenwyfar', 'Lancelot', 'other', 'familiar', 'characters', 'begin', 'rebel', 'being', 'moved', 'pieces', 'game', 'board.Why', 'quintessential', 'British', 'story', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'American', 'actors', 'used', 'speak', 'painfully', 'slowly', 'attempts', 'sound', 'English', 'use', 'dreadful', 'faux-British', 'accents', 'frequently', 'slip', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'accent', 'admirable', 'too', 'strident', 'not', 'ethereal', 'enough', 'Lady', 'Lake', 'thoroughly', 'evil', 'Mordred', 'entirely', 'eyebrows', 'are', 'abysmal', 'performances', 'minor', 'roles.Such', 'lavish', 'production', 'deserves', 'better', 'sets', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'are', 'visually', 'spectacular', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'annoyances', 'distract', 'viewer', ""'mists"", 'title', 'are', 'created', 'overindulgence', 'smoke', 'machines', 'perhaps', 'symbolic', 'fact', 'wrong', 'hands', 'good', 'story', 'can', 'become', 'bad', 'film']",The Mists of Avalon

I was hoping for the best for this, but instead found it a bone-cruchingly self-serious tale set in a land where nary a hairbrush is to be found (for most of the cast sports hair so plaited and oiled as to become a distraction).What traditionally is a lusty legend full of passion and betrayal becomes a bloodless overly-intellectual exercise in which all the actors (with the notable exception of the always great Joan Allen) seem to have inhaled too much, ahem, incense. Ploddingly paced and directed by Uli Edel (who managed to make S&amp;M candle-wax dull in Madonna's &quot;Body of Evidence&quot;), and with serviceable, but sub-par, photography by Vilmos Zsigmond the film never gains any sense of awe or wonder, instead playing its visuals as close to the bodice as it does its emotions. It is a film almost completely without dynamic. With such a strong group of lead performers, one would hope for them to have something meaty to bite into, but instead, the get a thin broth of a story and roles.Many people have brought up the balanced and accurate pagan portrayal that is present in this film. Fine, except that, as it is truly a sedate and contemplative religion, its simplicity and un-sensational nature (no pun intended) doesn't help to make a dull film any livelier (no offense to paganism and wicca meant).And suffice to say, I hesitate to recommend any film in which Uther Pendragon (traditionally a king who's passions and desires exceed his intellect and sire of the great Arthur, King of England) is most memorable as being... short.",2,An Arthurian retelling beset w/ dull &amp; pedestrian trappings,1008547200,"12 17, 2001",2001,1690,"['Ah', 'yes', 'Marion', 'Zimmer', 'Bradley', 'feminist/pagan', 'slanted', 'retelling', 'Arthur', 'legend', 'cast', 'lurching', 'awkward', 'TV', 'movie', 'was', 'hoping', 'best', 'instead', 'found', 'bone-cruchingly', 'self-serious', 'tale', 'set', 'land', 'where', 'hairbrush', 'be', 'found', 'most', 'cast', 'sports', 'hair', 'so', 'plaited', 'oiled', 'become', 'distraction', 'traditionally', 'lusty', 'legend', 'full', 'passion', 'betrayal', 'becomes', 'bloodless', 'overly-intellectual', 'exercise', 'actors', 'notable', 'exception', 'always', 'great', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'seem', 'have', 'inhaled', 'too', 'much', 'ahem', 'incense', 'Ploddingly', 'paced', 'directed', 'Uli', 'Edel', 'who', 'managed', 'make', 'S', 'amp', 'M', 'candle-wax', 'dull', 'Madonna', 'quot', 'Body', 'Evidence', 'quot', 'serviceable', 'sub-par', 'photography', 'Vilmos', 'Zsigmond', 'film', 'never', 'gains', 'sense', 'awe', 'wonder', 'instead', 'playing', 'visuals', 'close', 'bodice', 'emotions', 'film', 'almost', 'completely', 'dynamic', 'strong', 'group', 'lead', 'performers', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'have', 'something', 'meaty', 'bite', 'instead', 'get', 'thin', 'broth', 'story', 'roles.Many', 'people', 'have', 'brought', 'up', 'balanced', 'accurate', 'pagan', 'portrayal', 'present', 'film', 'Fine', 'truly', 'sedate', 'contemplative', 'religion', 'simplicity', 'un-sensational', 'nature', 'pun', 'intended', ""n't"", 'help', 'make', 'dull', 'film', 'livelier', 'offense', 'paganism', 'wicca', 'meant', 'suffice', 'say', 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'film', 'Uther', 'Pendragon', 'traditionally', 'king', 'who', 'passions', 'desires', 'exceed', 'intellect', 'sire', 'great', 'Arthur', 'King', 'England', 'most', 'memorable', 'being', 'short']",The Mists of Avalon

I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]Mists of Avalon (T.V. Miniseries) - We own the DVD and watched this TNT made for T.V. movie back in 2001Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):Throw everything you know about King Arthur out the window as this Marion Zimmer Bradley epic novel turned into a T.V. miniseries refashions the legend to `dispel the lies' which we all know and love.  Viviane - The Lady of the Lake and High Priestess of the Goddess (Anjelica Huston) is charged with keeping the Old Religion alive during a period in England's history when the new faith was making serious inroads to expel any who followed the peaceful way of The Great Mother.  A series of king-making marriages are arranged beginning with Irgraine and Uther, The Great Marriage (a magical rite to bind the new king and the land) between Arthur (Edward Atterton) and a mysterious priestess, who turns out to be his half-sister, Morgaine (Julianna Margulies) much to both their surprise, and Arthur to Gwenhwyfar.  Viviane's plans are frustrated by family squabbles, ruthless rivalries, and Christian priests who seek to stamp out Goddess worship for good.  King-craft is messy business and this retelling of the famous saga seeks to show the powerful women who helped shape the age of Camelot.Here at the Thomason Family Society for Movie Goodness we have a few rules - we do our best to not compare the MOVIE to the BOOK.  It's never fruitful because with few exceptions the book is always going to win out.  This particular book, a household favorite, is hard to keep to that restriction because of the indelible mark the book has left in our minds.  Marion Bradley's feminizing of the epic saga was so well done that it left this Movie Dude wondering if perhaps she really was `setting the record straight' and filling in the gaps in the story.  The book would earn 5 stars without a doubt, with that said...Naturally the story has been watered down and simplified (overly simplified at times) and the production levels are what you'd expect from a good episode of Xena but the flick does get the basic story on the screen.  There is such a clear difference in the level of acting which Anjelica Huston and Julianna Margulies where able to render compared the relatively b-grade performances of the other cast members... whatever money they paid Anjelica and Julianna was money well spent for sure.  This warbling of quality is evident in the cinematography as well with some scenes showcasing some genuinely beautiful shots and others being average T.V.-esque.  One solidly built component was the soundtrack which contained a haunting ditty by Loreena McKinnett ""The Mystic's Dream"" - as a matter of fact the soundtrack was so well put together this Movie Dude bought it along with the movie (and on a side note, it might say something that the SOUNDTRACK was $5 more expensive than the MOVIE itself... hmmmmm (snicker)).  All things considered it was a valiant effort for a T.V. mini-series to undertake as I'm not sure a big budget Hollywood blockbuster could have done much better with this complex tale (but I sure would love to see them try).One thing I loved:&lt;~> A genuine feeling story-line which brought a more truthful and balanced feel to the Arthurian legendOne thing I did NOT like:&lt;~> A script which left serious quantities of Bradley's masterpiece behind - half way through script writer Gavin Scott turned from the original and never looked back (like, a real bummer man)Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

676077,A28YVF72KWOJ1X,B00005QW5Y,KENNY NG,"[3, 8]","The fact that there is no Perceval and no the search for the Holy Grail in Mists of Avalon testifies to the essentially revisionist interpretation this movie gives on the Arthur legend.  Instead of an evil pagan sorceress, Morgan is a ""high priestess"" of Avalon who wishes to preserve the religion of the ""Goddess"" of Earth and to keep the Britons strong as the Saxons invade the Isles.  This movie depicts many familiar elements like Uther's seduction of Igraine, Lancelot's adultery and Arthur's incest in a different light.  Rather than moments of human weakness, sin, and treachery that require moral redemption, they are shown as necessary acts that would bring about pure and strong heirs and keep Britain and Avalon alive.  This TV movie features impressive sets, costumes, and a strong cast.  It will appeal to those seeking a more historically accurate Camelot prior to the Saxon conquest, and it will delight those wishing for a more active female role in Arthur's rise and fall.  However, it will bore those looking for fantastic elements, bloody battle scenes, and whimsical wizards, and it will outrage anyone who objects to the politicization of sex, the absence of Christian morality and redemption, and the romanticization of paganism (so-called ""New Age"" religion) that is so typical today.This movie is definately NOT Excalibur or La Morte d'Arthur.  Whearas Boorman's Excalibur was entertaining and deeply moving with its Wagnerian soundtrack and Christian overtones, Mists of Avalon has much lower entertainment value and is devoid of any inspiring message.  Watching it is akin to listening to a lecture on World War Two by some feminist historian talking about the mundane but vital role women played at the homefront while their men fought epic battles abroad.

Folks, this was NOT the book that Bradley wrote.  There were a few very, very important scenes and plot points that were deliberately left out for network TV (although I am rather shocked that they put the threesome scene in. I thought that if anything was going to go, it would be that).Since sooo many people today cannot be bothered to read this magnificent, albeit long, book, I shall relate to you a few grievances here: Lancelet and Arthur had issues.  Issues of the sort that tend to make the censors go mad, which is why I'm surprised that the threesome scene went in there.  Sadly, though, we were deprived of a brilliant moment where Gwen, in one of her typical hysterical whiny fits that made the book so entertaining, reveals the truth about the *ahem* nature of Lance and Art's relationship...as well as revealing the truth about Arthur's feelings for his sister.  That would be another fantastic bit left out--the morning after Beltane.  In the book, Arthur and Morgaine recognize one another.  It is actually a very, very moving passage.  But noooo...that's officially ""Too Hot For TV.""On the flip side, there were a few things that I must say were okay.  For one, everyone who watched this who had not read the book seemed to understand it, which is more than I can say for most epic miniseries adaptations.  For another, the casting, scenery, and costuming was by and large excellent.  (Although having the same actress play Morgause at 14 and Morgause and 65 was [bad].)  Viviane, Morgaine, Igraine, Lancelet, Arthur, and Uther were pretty much exactly as I had always thought of them in the books.  Gwen was not nearly whiny enough, but that's the fault of the writers--really, folks, if you think I'm being too hard on poor Gwenwyfar, read the ... book.All in all, you'll have to use your own discretion.  I must warn you, though: if you read the book and liked it, you will hate this movie.  You will not understand it, because there are VERY CRUCIAL ELEMENTS missing.  If you have not read the book, and don't really want to, and are content to think of Lancelet and Gwen as a sweet and star-crossed pair that could have been SO HAPPY together, knock yourself out.

Now, the movie was marketed as a look the legends from the female perspective, but this is a tad understating it.  In fact, the movie suggests that it was in fact the female characters in the whole spiel that were the key figures.  Needless to say, some of the females who traditionally had certain negative attributes are in fact not all that bad after all, and it's only because of the workings of certain corrupting males that they happen to do bad things.  I'm sure this is the reason why the movie (and I suppose the book, which I haven't read) is seemingly so popular among females.  But while the traditionally bad female characters have been vindicated, interestingly enough the whole story hinges on one female's--Vivien, the head godess--ruthless attempt to save Avalon from the onslaught of the Saxons and their male-dominated religious belief, Christianity.  For the head-goddess of a belief system that is supposedly more peaceful and egalitarian, she doesn't conduct herself in all that pleasant of a manner; she ruins lives through manipulation and coercion, and if anything, actually assures the demise of the belief system that she cherishes so dearly.  Evidently it doesn't occur to her that in the course of her ""doing everything"" in her power to perserve the old ways, it's men who are expected to do the fighting; there are no female warriors in this story, and no indication that the women were even inclined to take up arms for the cause.

Marion Zimmer Bradley took a twist on the story, telling it from the point of view of the 'dark witch' instead of the 'golden haired beauty'.It's a tale full of the raw power of medieval England, where a belief in nature and natural spirits was vying with the approach of Christianity. It tells not only of women and men's different views of the world, but of love triangles, Christianity ousting the 'old ways', and a changing of culture.The TNT miniseries version stars Anjelica Huston, Julianna Margulies, and Joan Allen in the girl-power production.  Huston is the magestic matriarch of Viviane, the Lady of the Lake, who in most stories is just the giver-of-the-sword to Arthur. Here she's the protector of Avalon, the center of the old power, one that is being replaced slowly by the bells of Christianity. They in fact share the same physical space, but only those with the power to believe can cross into Avalon.Margulies is Morgaine, Arthur's half-sister. They share a mother, but Arthur is born when Uther Pendragon lusts after Morgaine's mother Igraine and through deception beds her. Igraine and Viviane are sisters, but while Viviane defends the old ways, Igraine turns to the new (Christianity). The third sister, Morgause, is jealous of the other two and causes quite a bit of trouble.This was always a favorite book of mine, so I was very curious how they would bring it on screen. The locations were gorgeous - it was shot in Czechoslovakia and has the primitive wildness that medieval England would have had. The costumes were also gorgeous, and the actors and actresses were top notch. I really enjoyed the relationship Morgaine has later in her life.I do understand that certain of the themes are sensitive to a TV viewing audience. After all, Arthur and his half-sister Morgaine sleep together (not realizing they're related) when they're teenagers, and she bears a son from this union. Also, Arthur and Lancelot were attracted to each other in the book. These layers of sexuality added another dimension to the story, but they were a bit too risque for many viewers. The story was altered to change the way a lot of this was presented.Also, the scene where Morgaine and Gueneviere first meet was supposed to contrast the beautiful-blonde-Christian vs the small-dark-pagan - at least that's how Morgaine saw it. Because the book is told from Morgaine's point of view, it's not always the reality, of course, but her impression of it. But in the miniseries they stripped away a lot of the dialogue so you loose some of that sense.And then, near the end, it slips completely away, and where at the end of the book I'm thrilled to have gone on the journey, with the miniseries I wonder just exactly was the spot where they went wrong. I think the key is to watch it and think of it as a way to get people to read the book. It's really enjoyable as a good movie to watch, and if it gets more people to read the book, that's fine by me!",3,Think of it as an intro to the book,1019260800,"04 20, 2002",2002,3133,"['Most', 'tellings', 'King', 'Arthur', 'story', 'focus', 'Arthur', 'Merlin', 'perhaps', 'mention', 'Gueneviere', 'unfaithful', 'wench', 'broke', 'up', 'great', 'friendship', 'Arthur', 'Lancelot', 'Marion', 'Zimmer', 'Bradley', 'took', 'twist', 'story', 'telling', 'point', 'view', ""'dark"", 'witch', 'instead', ""'golden"", 'haired', ""beauty'.It"", 'tale', 'full', 'raw', 'power', 'medieval', 'England', 'where', 'belief', 'nature', 'natural', 'spirits', 'was', 'vying', 'approach', 'Christianity', 'not', 'only', 'women', 'men', 'different', 'views', 'world', 'love', 'triangles', 'Christianity', 'ousting', ""'old"", 'ways', 'changing', 'culture.The', 'TNT', 'version', 'stars', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'girl-power', 'production', 'Huston', 'magestic', 'matriarch', 'Viviane', 'Lady', 'Lake', 'who', 'most', 'stories', 'just', 'giver-of-the-sword', 'Arthur', 'Here', 'protector', 'Avalon', 'center', 'old', 'power', 'one', 'being', 'replaced', 'slowly', 'bells', 'Christianity', 'fact', 'share', 'same', 'physical', 'space', 'only', 'power', 'believe', 'can', 'cross', 'Avalon.Margulies', 'Morgaine', 'Arthur', 'half-sister', 'share', 'mother', 'Arthur', 'born', 'when', 'Uther', 'Pendragon', 'lusts', 'Morgaine', 'mother', 'Igraine', 'deception', 'beds', 'Igraine', 'Viviane', 'are', 'sisters', 'Viviane', 'old', 'ways', 'Igraine', 'new', 'Christianity', 'third', 'sister', 'Morgause', 'jealous', 'other', 'two', 'quite', 'bit', 'trouble.This', 'was', 'always', 'favorite', 'book', 'mine', 'was', 'very', 'curious', 'how', 'would', 'bring', 'screen', 'locations', 'were', 'gorgeous', 'was', 'shot', 'Czechoslovakia', 'primitive', 'wildness', 'medieval', 'England', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'costumes', 'were', 'also', 'gorgeous', 'actors', 'actresses', 'were', 'top', 'notch', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'relationship', 'Morgaine', 'later', 'life.I', 'do', 'understand', 'certain', 'themes', 'are', 'sensitive', 'TV', 'viewing', 'audience', 'Arthur', 'half-sister', 'Morgaine', 'sleep', 'together', 'not', 'realizing', ""'re"", 'related', 'when', ""'re"", 'teenagers', 'son', 'union', 'Also', 'Arthur', 'Lancelot', 'were', 'attracted', 'other', 'book', 'layers', 'sexuality', 'added', 'dimension', 'story', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'risque', 'many', 'viewers', 'story', 'was', 'altered', 'change', 'way', 'lot', 'was', 'presented.Also', 'scene', 'where', 'Morgaine', 'Gueneviere', 'first', 'meet', 'was', 'supposed', 'contrast', 'beautiful-blonde-Christian', 'vs', 'small-dark-pagan', 'least', 'how', 'Morgaine', 'saw', 'book', 'told', 'Morgaine', 'point', 'view', 'not', 'always', 'reality', 'course', 'impression', 'miniseries', 'stripped', 'away', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'loose', 'sense.And', 'then', 'end', 'completely', 'away', 'where', 'end', 'book', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'have', 'gone', 'journey', 'miniseries', 'wonder', 'just', 'exactly', 'was', 'spot', 'where', 'went', 'wrong', 'think', 'key', 'watch', 'think', 'way', 'get', 'people', 'read', 'book', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'more', 'people', 'read', 'book', 'fine']",The Mists of Avalon

It was to ocultic for my tasts (and no book about king Arthur ,no matter the writter, is as great as Malory's LE MORTE D' ARTHUR). Also id like to add that EXCALIBURE is thus far the best arthur movie ive seen.However I rather liked this movie. For a tv movie it was rather well acted. I have allways found tv movies are made in a rather dull way. The actors usley don't put themselves into their chartures. Not so here. There are fine perfomences in this pic.Basicly the book dealt with the women in the arthurian world. First Igarin and her unwillingness to be given to uther, Vivian who wants to keep avilon alive, Guinever who wants to put aside arthurs ""pagan"" ways and have him embrace christianty, Morgorse who craves power, and Morgain who wants to preserve avilon.The movie (which plot lines had to be shortened to make time) coverd some of this. We see igrain being taken by uther and the birth of arthur. Anjelica Huston was good as Vivian. She had the most convincing role of the movie. she does what she wills to preserve avilon and the goddess. Joan Allen is good as Morgorse whos lusts after power and will stop at nothing to get it. Juliannna Margulies does well as morgain. she must deal with the pain and saddness of all that takes place. Guinever does not have as much part as in the book but she plays her own part though it seems small in this movie. The actress who playes her does well.  All the femail acters do well here even the small part of guinevere. After all this is a book written by a woman about women. As such the femail actors shine here. The male actors play there part though small. The only men who make any real impression are arthur, lancelot, uther, and mordread. The reast seem to be in the back ground.

676099,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00005QW5Y,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[49, 69]","Incest, talk of abortion, threesomes, convoluted relationships, pregnancy out of wedlock - and this is all set in the olden days, not like a modern day soap opera as you might be thinking!After the disappointment that was Excalibur, I have to admit, I was not looking forward to watching this. But I found the movie utterly enchanting, on the same lines as Merlin. With Excalibur being so disappointing, next on my list is Jerry Bruckheimer's Hollywood version of King Arthur. It will certainly be interesting, as Keira Knightley's Gwenwyfar/Guinevere (which spelling is it?) is portrayed as a fighter, rather than a lover.I've read most of the other reviews on here, criticising the film, because it's so unlike the book. I've never read or heard of the book, so I don't feel the need to go on and on about it when you're reviewing the movie. Leave the book out of it.There are some fantastic actors in this: Anjelica Huston, Julianna Margulies, Joan Allen, Samantha Mathis, Edward Atterton and Michael Vartan, along with many other familiar British actors - namely Noah Huntley, who used to be in Emmerdale. Edward Atterton annoyed the hell out of me, not because he was generally annoying, but because I knew who he was, particularly with his longer hair & beard towards the end of the movie. Yet looking him up, I can't find out where I would know him from, nor can I remember where I know him from. He was also very nice! The main grievance I have with the characters in this movie, is some of them age considerably (Michael Vartan's Lancelot, Igraine, Morgause, Gwenwyfar/Guinevere, Arthur), while some of them, particularly Morgaine, don't age at all, even though the film is based over a period of 50 years, if not more.The film portrays incest between Arthur & Morgaine, and she gives birth to his child, albeit out of wedlock, and he doesn't find out until later in the film who the child really is. You'd think this subject would be rather disgusting, considering what it is, but then you can consider it, as they didn't grow up together. And you always hear about brothers & sisters meeting after a long period of separation, having a connection. Towards the end, the incest almost comes across as being planned.I found the drunken royal threesome to be very weird however. There's supposed to be an obvious attraction between Lancelot & Gwenwyfar/Guinevere (in Merlin & Excalibur, this was never really touched upon as it is in this), yet in those days, surely there would have to be something said! There's also lots of things said between Arthur & Lancelot, which could be taken completely the wrong way in these days, but in those days, it would be seen as harmless, for two guys to say they love each other.The imagery and scenery in this is absolutely amazing. Even better than Merlin. The drawing down of the mists to reveal Avalon is breath-taking, and although the castle looks sometimes slightly dodgy, and sometimes it looks like it's made out of wood, but you pretend you didn't see that, just to see Avalon again.I enjoy how out of each of the movies I've seen so far, they've all focused on a different aspect of the story. Merlin was well obviously based around Merlin's story and this was based more on the women in Arthur's life, bringing the story of Lancelot and Gwenwyfar to the fore, giving Merlin only a few small scenes. Morgaine is focused on also, she plays a big role of sleeping with her own brother, bearing his child, to being married to the father, when she really likes the son! I didn't quite understand why Morgause made Gwenwyfar/Guinevere infertile, I found that topic to be pushed aside as soon as it appeared on screen. And because I'd seen Merlin before, I already knew who most of the characters were, and what was going to happen - whereas if I hadn't seen Merlin, I would have been confused, as I found the characters were never really introduced that well.I'd be curious to see what all the fuss about the book is. All other reviewers seem to say is that it's 900 pages. If it kept me entertained for long enough, then that would be fine by me.It will be very, very interesting to see Jerry Bruckheimer's version now, I'll be getting that the minute it comes out on DVD. So far I've seen one bad, two very good Arthur films (we're not counting the Disney film here!) At the moment, I want to say this is better than Merlin - who knows, I may have to get my own copy of this!Just an extra little note: don't be put off by the length of this. If I can sit through Titanic a zillion times over, I felt sure I could sit through this, without getting an numb butt.

It disappointed me then. I just re watched it and when I would have given it 1 star 9 years ago, I give it 2 now. I realize 2 stars is not much of a rating, and if I were not comparing it to the book, perhaps I'd give it 3 stars.There are many problems with this film, such as missing characters, change in plot, actors chosen to play characters. I think Anjelica Huston, Julianna Marguiles, and Joan Allen are all very good actresses. Their spirits do fit those of the characters, but other than Julianna, I don't feel any of them really look the part. Vivianne is a short woman, who has Faerie blood in her, Morgaine as well. In the novel, they are never considered necessarily beautiful, except to those who love them, or when they empower the Goddess.There was no Kevin the Harper. That disappointed me a lot, because he was very important to the story.I understand this was a movie made for TV, but I think a story such as ""The Mists of Avalon"" deserves an HBO adaptation, or a Showtime adaptation, if not a full length film. The story can be done right in the limited time allowed. The way I see it is, if ""The Lord of the Rings"" can be adapted into beautiful films (despite their changes), then there is no reason ""The Mists of Avalon"" cannot.I do suggest, that if you plan to read the book, do so before watching the film.

Having studied Arthurian legend in college, I found Morgaine's version refreshing and far more absorbing than some of the rather dry tales I read in school. While the female perspective of the story shifts the meaning of some of the events, I found it far more striking that this version brings Christianity's squelching of the Old Religion to the forefront. This may not be obvious to those who are not familiar with nature based faiths. Those who have studied or practice these religions will spot this immediately.  Although Viviane has let power go to her head and misuses that power, other glimpses into the practices of herbalism, shamanism and divination are quite accurate. The film also portrays Arthur as quite the marshmallow, a side of him that had not struck me so strongly in other tales.The acting is flawless, the scenery is beautiful and the story is one to get lost in.  Although it is told in a different voice, it still contains all of the juicy elements we love in medieval tales.I highly recommend reading the book after seeing the movie, if you haven't read it yet.

676112,A376UHS8GODI8W,B00005QW5Y,Patrick Selitrenny,"[3, 4]","All jokes apart, Mists of Avalon is a discreet adaptation of the main novel. But since we are not here to evaluate the written work, which undoubtedly is far superior, I do give it five stars for its standalone value.For the first time since I can remember, we get a coherent view into the otherwise mysterious world of Druids and High Priestesses of Avalon and their worries about the various cultural invasions and intrusions into their untouched world.On the visual side, this TV movie should be considered a winner: the costumes reflect the accurate period in which the story takes place.If you are looking for knights in their shiny armors, you're in the wrong place, and this is actually good, because there were none between the 6th and 9th Century A.D.The only armor which could have eventually been seen was a long outdated Roman one...Now to the actresses/actors: they are all great performers who deliver memorable, strong performances and are all of a very high calibre.The storyline is subtle and is treated with respect. It winds up slowly to a crescendo that really culminates in a sort of an apotheosis only to slip slowly down to the inevitable end of a period, of a culture, of a belief and of the movie. But is the end really the end?I found the director Uli Edel, very competent, handling a very complex subject with finesse and light-handed ""magic"".Perhaps it's not a Historic movie, since it has to deal with very difficult figures to define, such as Merlin and Viviane, not to speak of Morgaine le Fey, but it attempts to bring them to us as true human figures, not as legendary heroes...They have feelings, worries and true emotions.In other words, what could have easily become another FANTASY movie has taken a life to itself and brings us a classic tale into a historic perspective.Some have criticized this movie as being a bad female perspective, sort of ""feminist"" version of Arthur's tale.I'd like to correct this. I am certainly not a friend of the feminist movement, but this is certainly not that.Many tend to forget that in the old Briton and Celtic world, women had a very prominent role in society and as such were truly equal, if not superior partners with the male world.In as much, this movie is just honest with this issue and deals with it in a very fair manner.Of course, certain visual effects, like the Avalon which appears towards the end of the movie, are a bit rough to deal with, since one could very well see that it was just a matte. Not even a scale model, but a flat matte!!! Shame.But in my personal view, movies are made or destroyed by a story, actors and directors, not just by music or special effects.If such was the case, we could very well listen to an audio book or watch digital cartoons.Thank God there is still a human component in movie making and with it comes some good and glorious imperfection, which in turn, gives a job to so many people to gossip about.With all its flaws and imperfections, this movie truly deserves my appreciation and my five stars. I also believe it will entertain you as well if you're not out, constantly seeking perfection (which by the way, has always been an elusive and useless activity which mankind has always wasted its efforts in).My best wishes go to all those who contributed their talents to this movie, for whatever reason they did so.",5,"Finally, no glitzy 16th century armor!!!",1023926400,"06 13, 2002",2002,3342,"['jokes', 'apart', 'Mists', 'Avalon', 'discreet', 'adaptation', 'main', 'novel', 'are', 'not', 'here', 'evaluate', 'written', 'work', 'undoubtedly', 'far', 'superior', 'do', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'standalone', 'value.For', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'remember', 'get', 'coherent', 'view', 'otherwise', 'mysterious', 'world', 'Druids', 'High', 'Priestesses', 'Avalon', 'worries', 'various', 'cultural', 'invasions', 'intrusions', 'untouched', 'visual', 'side', 'TV', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'winner', 'costumes', 'reflect', 'accurate', 'period', 'story', 'are', 'looking', 'knights', 'shiny', 'armors', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'place', 'actually', 'good', 'were', 'none', '6th', '9th', 'Century', 'A.D.The', 'only', 'armor', 'could', 'have', 'eventually', 'been', 'seen', 'was', 'long', 'outdated', 'Roman', 'one', 'Now', 'actresses/actors', 'are', 'great', 'performers', 'who', 'deliver', 'memorable', 'strong', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'high', 'calibre.The', 'storyline', 'subtle', 'treated', 'respect', 'up', 'slowly', 'crescendo', 'really', 'sort', 'apotheosis', 'only', 'slip', 'slowly', 'down', 'inevitable', 'end', 'period', 'culture', 'belief', 'movie', 'end', 'really', 'end', 'found', 'director', 'Uli', 'Edel', 'very', 'competent', 'handling', 'very', 'complex', 'subject', 'finesse', 'light-handed', 'magic', 'not', 'Historic', 'movie', 'deal', 'very', 'difficult', 'figures', 'define', 'such', 'Merlin', 'Viviane', 'not', 'speak', 'Morgaine', 'le', 'Fey', 'bring', 'true', 'human', 'figures', 'not', 'legendary', 'heroes', 'have', 'feelings', 'worries', 'true', 'emotions.In', 'other', 'words', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'become', 'FANTASY', 'movie', 'taken', 'life', 'classic', 'tale', 'historic', 'perspective.Some', 'have', 'criticized', 'movie', 'being', 'bad', 'female', 'perspective', 'sort', 'feminist', 'version', 'Arthur', 'tale.I', ""'d"", 'like', 'correct', 'am', 'certainly', 'not', 'friend', 'feminist', 'movement', 'certainly', 'not', 'that.Many', 'tend', 'forget', 'old', 'Briton', 'Celtic', 'world', 'women', 'had', 'very', 'prominent', 'role', 'society', 'such', 'were', 'truly', 'equal', 'not', 'superior', 'partners', 'male', 'world.In', 'much', 'movie', 'just', 'honest', 'issue', 'deals', 'very', 'fair', 'manner.Of', 'course', 'certain', 'visual', 'effects', 'Avalon', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'bit', 'rough', 'deal', 'one', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'see', 'was', 'just', 'matte', 'Not', 'even', 'scale', 'model', 'flat', 'matte', 'Shame.But', 'personal', 'view', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'destroyed', 'story', 'actors', 'directors', 'not', 'just', 'music', 'special', 'effects.If', 'such', 'was', 'case', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'listen', 'audio', 'book', 'watch', 'digital', 'cartoons.Thank', 'God', 'still', 'human', 'component', 'movie', 'making', 'good', 'glorious', 'imperfection', 'turn', 'job', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'gossip', 'about.With', 'flaws', 'imperfections', 'movie', 'truly', 'appreciation', 'five', 'stars', 'also', 'believe', 'will', 'entertain', 'as', 'well', ""'re"", 'not', 'out', 'constantly', 'seeking', 'perfection', 'way', 'always', 'been', 'elusive', 'useless', 'activity', 'mankind', 'always', 'wasted', 'efforts', '.My', 'best', 'wishes', 'go', 'who', 'contributed', 'talents', 'movie', 'reason', 'did', 'so']",The Mists of Avalon

I've heard several people say she's too attractive to be Morgaine, and that she doesnt age at all, whereas at least the other actors in the movie are made to age. In the book, it was remarked several times that she and Viviane were of the Fairie people, and they dont age until one day, they just suddenly appear old. Also, i think that was used to set Morgaine apart from the others.Theother actors seemed well chosen, except for a few.My gripes:Viviane. Her motives, to me, seemed a tad unclear sometimes. Angelica Huston is a good actress, but sometimes you didnt get the sense she was a prietess who would sacrifice everything for Avalon. Could be the scriptwriters fault though.Joan Allen: personally, as Morgause was supposed to be 14 when the story started, she should have been used as Morgause got older, and a younger woman earlier in the film.

676118,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B00005QW5Y,Robert J. Crawford,"[1, 1]","To be honest, I did not think that 3 hours could encompass the incredible depth and complexity of Bradley's masterwork.  But I got this out of curiosity and because my kids would probably enjoy it.  I am sorry to report that this film barely sufficed to hold my interest - I constantly thought back with disappointment to the book I read (and vividly remember from) nearly 20 years ago, which had phenomenal character development and covered every aspect the Arthur myth from a new point of view.  Nonetheless, I feel that this film requires a careful review on its own.The theme of the story is the collision of two religions, one the pagan earth goddess and the other christian monotheism.  Morgaine, long portrayed as an evil heathen, is the most sympathetic actor in this version, both a victim of political machination and also a fighter to preserve the old religion.  Julianna Margulies is a truly wonderful Morgaine, too beautiful perhaps, but she really gets the character.  The problem is that the film if too short to chart her evolution, from acolyte to rebel to leader, all the time recognizing the tragedy as it unfolds so inexorably.  The same can be said of Huston, who is a wonderful Viviane (ruthless, loving, desperate, majestic), and Allen as the cold and ambitious Morgause.  The only way they could have succeeded would have been to triple the time of the film.  The film also succeeds in placing the men on the side - less aware of the forces at play than as men of action.  The male actors, all of whom are lesser known than the three female stars, are all very good.That being said, as it progresses, the film is less and less faithful to the novel, again in part because it has to truncate the plots, shrink back the themes, and eliminate characters.  For example, in the book, Merlin is succeeded by a crippled musician who becomes Morgaine's lover for years; he then concludes that the religion is finished, hands over the pagan chalice that is transmogrified into the holy grail in a transcendently sad scene of religious vision, and his punishment is death.

Kay ""pagan bookworm""","[1, 2]","This is a beautiful retelling of the Arthurian legend, with a welcome twist of change which makes Morgan le Fay (Morgaine) the heroine instead of the villainess we're accustomed to seeing in ""Excalibur.""  The movie begins with three sisters:  Viviane (the Lady of the Lake and High Priestess of Avalon), Igraine (mother of Morgaine and Arthur) and Morgause.  Upon learning of her destiny with the future High King, Uther Pendragon, Igraine is reluctant to accept but very quickly falls in love with Uther, and he with her.  Their secret tryst on the night of her husband Gorlois's death at war, results in the conception of Arthur.  When Morgaine and Arthur are both old enough, they are taken from Uther and Igraine and to their separate futures.  Morgaine is groomed by Viviane to become the next high priestess of Avalon, a magical land which is fading away as people stop believing in it and in the Goddess.  One of the other priestesses is Raven, a kind soul who has taken a vow of silence.  Morgaine grows into a beautiful woman in the form of Julianna Marguilies, and is chosen to take part in the Great Marriage at Beltane.  She doesn't realize until after she realizes she is pregnant with the Beltane child and after her reunion with Arthur that he was the man she slept with in the Great Marriage.  Yuk!  Anyway, lots of twists and turns in the saga of Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere, the coming of age of Mordred by his evil aunt Morgause, and the slow fading of Avalon of the years passing by and the deaths of Merlin and Viviane.  We all know how it ends.  I screamed right along with Raven when Viviane died.While this is a great film which I would gladly recommend to anyone with an interest in the legend of Avalon, there are a few roles which I believe was miscast.  Even though they did a great job anyway, I think that Michael Vartan, Edward Atterton, and Hans Matheson were all miscast for their roles as Lancelot, Arthur, and Mordred.  I really believe that they could have found better actors for those roles, but the final selections are well enough.

It focuses on the women of Camelot and their pagan religion. It shows the changes it goes through as the people of England embrace Christianity.My Opinion: I was hoping for steel on steel action with knight facing knight but instead I got religion versus religion and priest facing priestess. I knew that this version was based on Marion Zimmer Bradley's book, but I did not know that it focused primarily on the women of Camelot and their religion. Avalon it turns out is a hidden island that is the home of the religion that worships the goddess of the earth. They train priestesses here and then send them out into the world to meddle in the affairs of men. Some people may find this interesting, but I was set to see King Arthur and got this instead. The three main actresses do a very good job. Julianna Margulies especially is very good as Morgaine. It's no surprise that Morgaine is portrayed as a victim and not the evil priestess that she is in other versions of the King Arthur legend. Anjelica Huston and Joan Allen also give good performances. In the end it was a long 183 minutes and I was left wanting some action.DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen anamorphic - 1.85:1  Sound: DD5.1 Extras: Deleted Scenes, Photo GalleryWhat You Should Do:  If you are a King Arthur purist you should skip this one. This is the story of the women of Camelot. It is written from the woman's point of view, which is quite different in this story.  It focuses mostly on the women and their religion, not on Arthur and the fighting.

676123,A9VBQBOMTCR1E,B00005QW5Y,"Sean E. Mcgrath ""kierianeleison""","[47, 60]","...then you throw yourself on it.Such is my impression of TNT's ""The Mists of Avalon"". MZB's book upon which this retelling is based is one of my favorite books of all time. When I heard that TNT was making a movie ersion I was excited... ooOOooooh, the same people who did ""Animal Farm"" and ""Moby Dick"" and ""A Christmas Carol"" (all of which I thoroughly enjoyed) were going to adapt a book which I have read and reread several times since my senior year in high school. I watched TNT looking for previews, commericials, anything in which I could see the appropriatley beautiful and haunted-looking Juliana Marguiles (as Morgaine) and the iron-faced Anjelica Houston (as Viviane) shine in their roles. And ooOOOOoooh the ads tempted and teased me. They showed a movie that was carefully constructed and lovingly filmed in perfect locations with the perfect mood.Well, they lied. What else can I say?When The Day finally arrived to watch, I was glued to my TV, and as time progressed I was still glued to my TV waiting for the movie to really ""start"". Six hours (or was it days?) later TMoA finished and I was left feeling hollow. This was it? What were they thinking??It's... well, it's cheesy (when it should be dignified); it's banal (when it should be sexy); it's simple (when it should be subtle); and it's bland (when it should be interesting).  There was no meat in which to sink my teeth..  no emotions for anyone (maybe for morgaine)..  no anger at the hypocrisy of people...  *sigh*  It's another example of how A Good Book Can Go Bad on Film, which is sad because TNT had been doing so well up until then.Told from the viewpoint of Morgaine (Le Fey), the history of Camelot is laid out as Christians and Druids vie for control of Dark Ages England by supporting the High King Arthur, each trying to ensure their survival in England's future. But here it really boiled down to a love story between Arthur and Gwenhwyfar, Gwenhwyfar and Lancelot, Lancelot and Arthur, Morgaine and Lancelot and Morgaine and Arthur. No real political or religious strife was shown; but ironically no hearts really seemed to be broken. All the passion of Camelot was dropped for the beauty of the image.. no one got dirty, the colors were way too bright, the moods were shallow and, honestly, for as much gold as Gwenhwyfar was decked out in I'm surprised she could stand up. Poor frail thing. Avalon was full up with veiled-women (which reminded me of Paradise Island in the Lynda Carter Wonder TV series) and magic that was uninteresting to say the least - where was the awe of the Goddess?  The horror of The Sight? And what was going on with Joan Allen's eye make-up?? That star-burst design was distracting in the least and Cleopatra Schwartz in the extreme. And why were all the Christians so clean?  Thomas Aquinas himself eschewed bathing in favor of fleas whom he referred to as ""my little brothers"".  I doubt there was that much yellow in the world back then.To be fair, though, I *was* touched two times during the movie - when Arthur and Morgaine were separated as children; and when Mordred was told his destiny was to betray his father Arthur. There was real emotin behind those moments. Sadly, they were brief. I also have to applaud TNT for not backing down form the incest issue, as it was integral to the plot.. even if they did A.) beat it over our heads, and B.) never really explain WHY Morgaine had to have a child with Arthur. The idea that Mordred would be raised to be the next High King as he was from two royal bloodlines (Pendragon and Avalon) was lost somewhere, so the incest in the movie just became kinda... well, gross. Noble effort, bad follow through.I really wanted to like this movie. I really did.

The film was told from a unique perspective: that of the women of Camelot. The women struggle with the ending of their matriarchal culture and the rising of a patriarchal one.  No one character is entirely evil. Some are selfish, others are driven to excess by their own desires or manipulated.  In particular, I loved the fact that all the characters were morally ambiguous.  One gets tired of reading about pure and innocent Arthur, virginal Gwenevere and rake-like Lancelot. Well, in Mists tells another story.Favorites: I loved the facial tattoos. Not overdone, just accenting the characters features. Especially the small blue-lines around the eyes. I enjoyed the characterization of Morgan, and the character of Uther. Uther was handsome and bear-like and kindly. The friendship that  Arthur and Lancelot shared was evident, and I found both actors to be quite handsome. Gwenevere was portrayed as cow-like and docile, and just a bit spiteful.  I even, felt sorry for Mordred, who in my opinion was the worst off, having been manipulated since the point of birth.I did think it was quite sad and telling that poor Morgan and the others never found happiness. In fact NONE of the characters found happiness towards the end (being stuck in a cloister doesn't cut it, at least for me), but I loved it. Excellent movie. Beautiful soundtrack.

The performances seemed to me like a high school production of some sort where everyone tries to be a good actor, but to no avail. 2}After reading the book, I realized that ANY movie adaption would be disasterous because of how great the book is and because of it's massive scope. There would be no real way to make a movie of it without cutting out massive (and sometimes vital) parts of the story, and as a result, destroying it. 3}It should never have been a made for TV movie. The story in and of itself is just too big, and it should have been done for the movies. Consider The Lord of the Rings trilogy for a minute...can you even imagine if those had been made for TV movies instead of theatrical releases? Can't really picture it can you?

I was transported by the misty lakes, green hills, and evocative soundtrack, yet the enjoyment was purely superficial.  The movie is not MZB's ""Mists,"" but a poor adaptation that reproduces selected events and characters without capturing the novel's spirit.  Condensing 876 pages to four hours, with half the time spent on the first 250 pages, completely undermines a thorough understanding of Paganism and its conflict with Christianity.  I was disappointed that Christianity was repeatedly shown to be the sole refuge for those seeking peace and forgiveness, while the Goddess religion was reduced to fertility rites.  The characters, though brilliantly portrayed, lack depth and seem more like the proverbial cardboard cut-outs than human beings.  In addition, the makers of this film did not concern themselves with story continuity. Many events were changed, but other events and dialog were not modified to reflect those changes, resulting in numerous inconsistencies.  Igraine is shown wearing a crescent, marking her as dedicated to the Goddess, yet she is married to ""Britain's greatest Christian warrior"" and he to her.  Morgause performs a certain ritual and tells her husband of it, yet later the two speak as though it never happened. Viviane is shown early in the movie to be an active, powerful force for Pagan preservation, yet later does nothing when it falls out of favor at Camelot.I sincerely hope that another, truer version of the book will be made by someone who loves and understands it as much as Peter Jackson loves ""The Lord of the Rings.""",3,"Enjoyable, but Not MZB's Mists",1004400000,"10 30, 2001",2001,1667,"['Visually', 'beautiful', 'musically', 'enchanting', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'movie', 'drew', 'back', 'again', 'again', 'was', 'transported', 'misty', 'lakes', 'green', 'hills', 'evocative', 'soundtrack', 'enjoyment', 'was', 'purely', 'superficial', 'movie', 'not', 'MZB', 'Mists', 'poor', 'adaptation', 'selected', 'events', 'characters', 'capturing', 'novel', 'spirit', 'Condensing', '876', 'pages', 'four', 'hours', 'time', 'spent', 'first', '250', 'pages', 'completely', 'thorough', 'understanding', 'Paganism', 'conflict', 'Christianity', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Christianity', 'was', 'repeatedly', 'shown', 'be', 'sole', 'refuge', 'seeking', 'peace', 'forgiveness', 'Goddess', 'religion', 'was', 'reduced', 'fertility', 'rites', 'characters', 'though', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'lack', 'depth', 'seem', 'more', 'proverbial', 'cardboard', 'cut-outs', 'human', 'beings', 'addition', 'makers', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'concern', 'story', 'continuity', 'Many', 'events', 'were', 'changed', 'other', 'events', 'dialog', 'were', 'not', 'modified', 'reflect', 'changes', 'resulting', 'numerous', 'inconsistencies', 'Igraine', 'shown', 'wearing', 'crescent', 'marking', 'as', 'dedicated', 'Goddess', 'yet', 'married', 'Britain', 'greatest', 'Christian', 'warrior', 'Morgause', 'certain', 'ritual', 'husband', 'yet', 'later', 'two', 'speak', 'never', 'happened', 'Viviane', 'shown', 'early', 'movie', 'be', 'active', 'powerful', 'force', 'Pagan', 'preservation', 'yet', 'later', 'nothing', 'when', 'favor', 'Camelot.I', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'version', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'someone', 'who', 'as', 'much', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Lord', 'Rings']",The Mists of Avalon
