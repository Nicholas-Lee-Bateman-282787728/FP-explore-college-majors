871020,A3L2856DIMUXJY,B0006M4S1Y,&#34;Belgo Geordie&#34;,"[0, 0]","I almost like Shane Meadows films. With the exception of the dull, predictable ""This is England"". But ""Dead Man's Shoes"" is a Greek Tragedy of a story. It has madness, family, blood, protection , revenge, redemption and failure- and some moments of humour. Elements of Eastwoods ""Unforgiven"" the loner driven to wreak terrible revenge but as much out of guilt than pay-back. I liked that Shane Meadows did not turn the protagonist Richard into a vigilante hero, which the film as it unfolded threatended to do. But had him face his own demons, his life, his career choice and at the end there is some redemption-but no happy ending. There is a lot of the morality play in the story of this film, you have to work at it to get it, but getting it answers our own revenge fantasies. in the end is it worth it? Does it make us a better person? Boy, the lights went on and I sat like a stunned cod at the end of this one. The cinematography fits the story well. The soundtrack also adds as if tailored for the film.

871021,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B0006M4S1Y,Anton Ilinski,"[24, 28]","""Dead Man's Shoes"" starts as an ordinary revenge flick. Its only zest, as I thought in twenty minutes after the beginning, was that the action takes place in a little suburban English town, and that adds a little coloring to the commonplace theme. And just how great it is when films don't fit your expectations, and I mean when they end up being much deeper and thoughtful than you could ever imagine.The subject of revenge has a lot of ground beneath it to philosophize and make smart films. But writers and directors don't always push the envelope, limiting themselves with a poor choice of story-lines and developments. Hence we get stupid exploitation flicks (no offence - I love them myself). But if creators of a picture are willing to use their brains at full - we get a chance to see outstanding examples of a very good quality cinema (I'd recall ""Se7en"" or ""Unforgiven""). ""Dead Man's Shoes"" is absolutely such an example. It's a shame the film is not well known because it really deserves to be.Richard is coming back from the army to his small town. He's got one thing on his mind - to punish the gang of local small-time drug dealers who bullied and tormented his younger retarded brother. And his vengeance will be severe... That's it, I'll say no more, because closer to the end the movie turns out to be not exactly what you expected it to be. It's thoughtful and extremely powerful, it has twists, it's an exploration of a man's madness, of his slow descent into insanity, it's about hangman and victim and about how difficult is sometimes to tell the difference. It raises serious questions and it will make you ponder. I was utterly surprised - what started as a banal vengeance movie then turned into something vicious, grave and not at all light-hearted. The acting was just compelling. Paddy Considine (""In America"", ""Cinderella Man"") created a very truthful and unforgettable character, Toby Kebbel, whom I haven't seen before, was just amazing as mentally-challenged Anthony, and as a thug leader we can see Gary Stretch whose face you'll never forget if you've seen him once.I haven't heard about director Shane Meadows before, but now I'm definately going to trace his career, for ""Dead Man's Shoes"" is not just one of the best British films I've seen, but it's one of the best films I've generally seen.Try to catch this film, I'm sure you won't regret it.",5,TRY WALKING IN THOSE SHOES,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,2382,"['Dead', 'Man', 'Shoes', 'ordinary', 'revenge', 'flick', 'only', 'zest', 'thought', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'beginning', 'was', 'action', 'place', 'little', 'suburban', 'English', 'town', 'little', 'coloring', 'commonplace', 'theme', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'when', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'expectations', 'mean', 'when', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'much', 'deeper', 'thoughtful', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine.The', 'subject', 'revenge', 'lot', 'ground', 'beneath', 'philosophize', 'make', 'smart', 'films', 'writers', 'directors', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'push', 'envelope', 'limiting', 'poor', 'choice', 'story-lines', 'developments', 'Hence', 'get', 'stupid', 'exploitation', 'flicks', 'offence', 'love', 'creators', 'picture', 'are', 'willing', 'use', 'brains', 'full', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'outstanding', 'examples', 'very', 'good', 'quality', 'cinema', ""'d"", 'recall', 'Se7en', 'Unforgiven', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Shoes', 'absolutely', 'such', 'example', 'shame', 'film', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'really', 'be.Richard', 'coming', 'back', 'army', 'small', 'town', 'got', 'one', 'thing', 'mind', 'punish', 'gang', 'local', 'small-time', 'drug', 'dealers', 'who', 'bullied', 'tormented', 'younger', 'retarded', 'brother', 'vengeance', 'will', 'be', 'severe', ""'ll"", 'say', 'no', 'more', 'closer', 'end', 'movie', 'out', 'be', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected', 'be', 'thoughtful', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'twists', 'exploration', 'man', 'madness', 'slow', 'descent', 'insanity', 'hangman', 'victim', 'how', 'difficult', 'sometimes', 'tell', 'difference', 'serious', 'questions', 'will', 'make', 'ponder', 'was', 'utterly', 'surprised', 'what', 'started', 'banal', 'vengeance', 'movie', 'then', 'turned', 'something', 'vicious', 'grave', 'not', 'light-hearted', 'acting', 'was', 'just', 'compelling', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'America', 'Cinderella', 'Man', 'created', 'very', 'truthful', 'unforgettable', 'character', 'Toby', 'Kebbel', 'whom', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'was', 'just', 'amazing', 'mentally-challenged', 'Anthony', 'thug', 'leader', 'can', 'see', 'Gary', 'Stretch', 'face', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'once.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'director', 'Shane', 'Meadows', 'now', ""'m"", 'definately', 'going', 'trace', 'career', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Shoes', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'best', 'British', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'generally', 'seen.Try', 'catch', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",N/A

Considine also starred as Richard, a retired soldier back to his small home town in Derbyshire, North England. He returned to teach a lesson to local small time thugs and drug dealers who had abused and humiliated his younger mentally retarded brother (Toby Kebbell in very sympathetic performance) while he was away on service. I received the film from Netflix few weeks ago and I kept putting it aside but finally watched it in one sitting without ever taking my eyes away from the screen and I am very impressed and even shocked by its raw emotions and truly powerful final 15 minutes. How often we would get involved with the story and the characters but later only become disappointed with the weak or illogical and not convincing ending. Dead Man's Shoes actually picks up its momentum at the 70th minute mark and it ends with the catharsis - or the closest to it from what I can think of. I also believe that I've witnessed one of the best performances by an actor in the last few years, and this is Paddy Considine as the archetype of the older brother, filled with anger and guilt. For him, hanging on in quiet desperation was not the English way. The film is short, is not an easy viewing by all means, it is not the film to relax but it brings intensity, real emotions, and very convincing acting. This is the second film directed by Shane Meadows that I saw. The first was This is England. Meadows knows well the places of his childhood and the people he personally encountered and who stuck in his memory. In This is England he recreated his own experience as a young 12 years old lonely boy who one summer got involved with the group of Skinheads.

Or put another way, it lacks logic at it's crucial moments.SPOILERSIn a film like Death Wish, which the Amazon review mentions in vague comparison, the killer (remember Bronson?) is on a mission of justified revenge against murdering criminals on the city streets.  His daughter'd been killed by such as them and in spite of him going outside the confines of the law on his vigilante killing spree the viewer sympathizes with him.  Not so in Dead Man's Shoes.  This time the killer, a returned soldier, is on a vengeance spree against a local drug dealer and some of his dealers for abusing and finally killing his retarded younger brother.  Through flashbacks we witness those crimes against the retarded brother, however we're not given the news that they actually caused his brother to kill himself until the end of the movie - a very poorly placed time to give us this bit of information since all the massacre scenes prior to it give us the impression the punishment doesn't quite fit their crimes.  Prior to his initial murdering of the main gang we see through flashbacks that they convince a girl to have sex with the retarded brother and they get him high on pot and LSD.  They are more than rude to him no doubt about it, but never reach the level where it seems suitable justice requires the full-on murder spree the army brother goes on. One particularly sad scene involves the killer getting the whole gang of guys unknowingly high on acid.  And while they are in the peak of an acid trip, murders them all one by one.  No, unlike Bronson, you feel no sympathy for this killer on his ""mission of vengeance"" as the punishment (certainly initially) seems way out of proportion to the crime.  It's particularly pathetic seeing the gang all killed at the height of an acid trip.  I will say, they looked high on acid.  Who wouldn't have had pity on a group in this condition?  Especially when the only crimes we the audience know about seem to be that they got his brother high (and laid).  So, this is no Bronson story.  I found it rather frustrating.  As mentioned, it's only much later in the film (the end really) that the film-makers show us how bad the gang really was.  Finally we get to feel that there was an ounce of sense in the killer's mission.  Of course, this happens AFTER the killer has massacred all but one of the original gang members.  Like as an afterthought.  But wouldn't it have made more sense to bring this on earlier so at least we'd have understood a bit of the killer's outrage?  Not necessary for some I guess.  Is the killer of the ""Friday the 13th"" variety or of the ""Death Wish"" variety?  Well, in this film it's both. I guess that's it's unique claim to fame but it didn't work for me.Other flaws.  At one point earlier in the movie after the killer has taken out the first of the drug dealers, the rest of the gang go visit the killer at his home. The leader of the drug gang has a high-powered rifle with sights and as they send one of their own to get the killer outside, the leader shoots the rifle and accidentally kills his own man.  Then the killer just stands there in the front yard and the drug gang leader doesn't take another shot.  Instead, he gets back in his car with his gun and drives away with his gang.  What?!!! He's only got one bullet? Come on!  I guess if he'd shot the killer at that point the movie would've ended too soon. It would have been fine with me. But please, that was a ridiculous scene.Finally, this movie has many other dull moments in the form of some lame acoustic guitar singer sountrack which accompanies overlong walks down the highway or a drive to someone's house or some flashbacks of the guy and his retarded kid brother enjoying their childhood together.  These can take up to 2 or 3 minutes each time.  I don't know why these were necessary but they really drew out an already overlong film.If you want to make drugs and drug dealers out to be baddies, I don't think it's a great idea to use marijuana and LSD as their drugs of their choice.  People who use these kinds of drugs are generally not the kind to be assaulting retarded kids.  I don't know, maybe the gang hadn't been using enough of their own product.  This movie is more an insult to one's intelligence than being offensive, but either way it's a waste of time.

I didn't quite get the level of retribution given the flashbacks of what happened to his brother until the final scenes - when all is revealed.  Nicely done indeed.

871039,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B0006M4S1Y,Mel Odom,"[1, 3]","Revenge is one of the most basic human emotions. People instantly relate to it and understand it, for the most part -- as long as it's motivated by feelings and situations they can sympathize with.Revenge is also one of the key elements in storytelling. Books, comics, and movies all routinely use revenge as motivation for characters, both good and evil. Lex Luthor is motivated by the need for revenge against Superman and does evil things as a result. Batman is motivated by a need for revenge against criminals because his parents were killed at the hands of one. He does good things as a result.Good and evil both spring forth from this highly emotional state. It's up to the writer/creator to decide how it's applied in the story. Many memorable characters, such as Captain Ahab of Moby Dick by Herman Melville, seen to be wholly made of that emotion.Dead Man's Shoes, directed by Shane Meadows, uses revenge as a motive to propel the characters through harsh events. The script was written by Shane Meadows, Paddy Considine, and Paul Fraser. Paddy Considine also stars as the main character, Richard, a young man who has returned from war to avenge his brother, Anthony, played by Tony Kebbell.The film is shot on location in England's Midlands. The scenes are beautiful, filled with trees and rolling hills around small towns of old, small buildings and houses. The music is lyrical and haunting.As it turns out, the viewer is given most of the story at the beginning. Richard and Anthony were close as brothers even though Anthony had mental deficiencies. While Richard was away at war in the military, Anthony fell in with a group of drug users and sellers who took advantage of him.Upon his return, Richard sets out on a trail of vengeance against the group. He terrorizes them at first, breaking into their homes and marking them while they sleep, letting them know he could have just as easily killed them.I think the movie was well done but I have some reservations. While I liked the characters well enough, and I think the twist about Anthony was a good one that I didn't expect, the actual physical action of the characters was definitely lacking. I didn't get to watch Richard take action for the first hour of the film. I saw the results of it, but I didn't see him doing those things.In action films, most of the stars use martial arts or something flashy to really show off their destructive talents. Even though Richard is more of a blunt instrument, his violence was kept off-screen for too much of the movie, in my opinion. I wanted to see him taking on the gang, and making them pay for what they have done to his brother.Also, I had a real problem with the audio portion of the disc. The accent is so thick, and the sound quality of the transfer somewhat lacking, that I couldn't hear everything that was being said. Many times it sounded like the actors were mumbling their lines. I'm sure that wasn't the case. I'm sure that you just need an ear trained for that dialect. I had to back up several times to replay a scene to get all of it. The movie will probably play really well in the Midlands because I feel certain Meadows is dead-on in his rendition of the local environment.This movie is definitely worth watching and is one a lot of people are talking about. The two concerns above notwithstanding, Meadows' vision of the story is genuine and heartfelt. Considine's pain is palpable. I'm going to be interested in seeing what this team comes up with next.",3,Revenge Film,1185753600,"07 30, 2007",2007,3490,"['Revenge', 'one', 'most', 'basic', 'human', 'emotions', 'People', 'instantly', 'relate', 'understand', 'most', 'part', 'as', 'long', 'motivated', 'feelings', 'situations', 'can', 'sympathize', 'with.Revenge', 'also', 'one', 'key', 'elements', 'storytelling', 'Books', 'comics', 'movies', 'routinely', 'use', 'revenge', 'motivation', 'characters', 'good', 'evil', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'motivated', 'need', 'revenge', 'Superman', 'evil', 'things', 'result', 'Batman', 'motivated', 'need', 'revenge', 'criminals', 'parents', 'were', 'killed', 'hands', 'one', 'good', 'things', 'result.Good', 'evil', 'spring', 'forth', 'highly', 'emotional', 'state', 'up', 'writer/creator', 'decide', 'how', 'applied', 'story', 'Many', 'memorable', 'characters', 'such', 'Captain', 'Ahab', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'Herman', 'Melville', 'seen', 'be', 'wholly', 'made', 'emotion.Dead', 'Man', 'Shoes', 'directed', 'Shane', 'Meadows', 'revenge', 'motive', 'propel', 'characters', 'harsh', 'events', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'Shane', 'Meadows', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'Paul', 'Fraser', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'also', 'main', 'character', 'Richard', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'returned', 'war', 'avenge', 'brother', 'Anthony', 'played', 'Tony', 'Kebbell.The', 'film', 'shot', 'location', 'England', 'Midlands', 'scenes', 'are', 'beautiful', 'filled', 'trees', 'rolling', 'hills', 'small', 'towns', 'old', 'small', 'buildings', 'houses', 'music', 'lyrical', 'haunting.As', 'out', 'viewer', 'given', 'most', 'story', 'beginning', 'Richard', 'Anthony', 'were', 'close', 'brothers', 'even', 'Anthony', 'had', 'mental', 'deficiencies', 'Richard', 'was', 'away', 'war', 'military', 'Anthony', 'fell', 'group', 'drug', 'users', 'sellers', 'who', 'took', 'advantage', 'him.Upon', 'return', 'Richard', 'out', 'trail', 'vengeance', 'group', 'first', 'breaking', 'homes', 'marking', 'sleep', 'letting', 'know', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'easily', 'killed', 'them.I', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'have', 'reservations', 'liked', 'characters', 'well', 'enough', 'think', 'twist', 'Anthony', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'actual', 'physical', 'action', 'characters', 'was', 'definitely', 'lacking', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'watch', 'Richard', 'take', 'action', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'saw', 'results', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'doing', 'things.In', 'action', 'films', 'most', 'stars', 'use', 'martial', 'arts', 'something', 'flashy', 'really', 'show', 'off', 'destructive', 'talents', 'Even', 'Richard', 'more', 'blunt', 'instrument', 'violence', 'was', 'kept', 'off-screen', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'opinion', 'wanted', 'see', 'taking', 'gang', 'making', 'pay', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'brother.Also', 'had', 'real', 'problem', 'audio', 'portion', 'disc', 'accent', 'so', 'thick', 'sound', 'quality', 'transfer', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'could', ""n't"", 'hear', 'everything', 'was', 'being', 'said', 'Many', 'times', 'sounded', 'actors', 'were', 'mumbling', 'lines', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', ""'m"", 'sure', 'just', 'need', 'ear', 'trained', 'dialect', 'had', 'back', 'up', 'several', 'times', 'replay', 'scene', 'get', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'play', 'really', 'well', 'Midlands', 'feel', 'certain', 'Meadows', 'dead-on', 'rendition', 'local', 'environment.This', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'talking', 'two', 'concerns', 'notwithstanding', 'Meadows', 'vision', 'story', 'genuine', 'heartfelt', 'Considine', 'pain', 'palpable', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'interested', 'seeing', 'what', 'team', 'up', 'next']",N/A

You don't really get this until right at the end, and then you're almost shocked by it; even as Considine is haunted throughout the film by the ghostly presence of Toby Kebbel's character, Anthony, you're not quite prepared for the fact that Richard is as guilty as the hoodlums he's murdering. Like his victims, he, too, apparently did not appreciate his brother as he should have done when Anthony was alive.  When he finally admits this guilt, it is as if Richard seeks absolution; he seems to be offering confession.The soundtrack to the movie is very well done and adds to the movie's sense of surreal meaning -- it has an almost spiritual quality to it.  I don't mean that to sound gushing; I mean that the whole piece is almost religious in its tone, as if the characters occupying the movie are only too aware of the sins they have committed (even as they flee or embrace them).  The acting is superb throughout, starting with Considine (who is very believable and very disturbing -- he makes you uncomfortable when he's staring at the other actors).  Toby Kebbel's performance is absolutely seamless, while Gary Stretch (the villain Sonny) is intensely creepy and unnerving.The relatively simple and even somewhat slow-moving plot is transcended by the cast and what they bring to the movie, elevating what has been horribly mischaracterized as a ""slasher film"" to the level of real drama.  This is a movie that can put three men in a hallway carrying a samurai sword, a dagger, and a pistol-crossbow without seeming silly. (The only problem many viewers will have with this film is that the characters all have heavy British accents and speak in their native slang.  There were times when I absolutely could not understand what was being said.)

And bullied he was, by a bunch of pathetic kids in the bodies of grown men who forced him to commit all sorts of depraved, humiliating acts. The film is quite disturbing at times, even though it is darkly humorous, it overall has a very tragic feel to it. It deals with similar themes to Meadows other film This is England, that of bullying and hatred, and to a lesser extant revenge and mental illness. Richard, is, in his own words, has become a monster, and if no one stops him, he's not going to stop himself. His body and soul has been corrupted by darkness, but you could tell, that deep down, he is a truly decent, honorable man who has been driven to commit acts of murder and carnage because he's filled with anger and perhaps regret. Dead Man's shoes started off somewhat uninteresting, and it took a while for it to get good, at least for me, so that's why I only give it 4 stars instead of 5, but towards the middle it started to pick up speed and never let me go until the end, leaving me at the edge of my seat the whole time.

It's a remarkable reimagining of Death Wish as it would be in the real world, set among tatty Midlands housing estates with villains with [...] cars and a pathetic array of mail order weaponry. Shot very effectively in a style somewhere between Italian neo-realism, early Scorsese and even Cassavettes improv but with a flavor all its own, it doesn't matter that one of the plot twists is very obvious (so obvious, in fact, I'm not even sure that it's even meant to be a twist) because co-writer Paddy Considine is such a riveting yet natural presence in the lead: he's able to be genuinely threatening while keeping it absolutely real, creating a very believable monster. There's no vanity, no attempt to go for the cool or the comic (if anything he undercuts the character's attempts to do so without ever becoming a cheap joke) and little in the way of grandstanding. And the gutted close-up of Considine closing his eyes in a bus shelter is a truly remarkable piece of acting without acting. In an industry where lightweights like Clive Owen get lead roles thrown at them, he's the real thing and quite possibly the greatest British actor of his generation.Not for everyone, perhaps (the reception in the US has been particularly poor), but one of the best low-budget British films in a long time.

A dark, disturbing but powerful drama of revenge ""Dead man's Shoes"" follows Richard (Paddy Constantine) a returning military vet who seeks revenge against a group of petty drug dealers who used and abused his developmentally disabled young brother. He begins terrorizing them by appearing in gas mask and military fatigues silently beckoning for one of the dealers to come outside. He then vandalizes their apartment and gradually escalates his private little war. What's unusual about this film is that it isn't your standard revenge flick. Clearly the director pulled from his personal experience. Evidently he was a skinhead and did more than his fair share of illegal things as a youth. He knows these people how they think talk and behave. Constantine gives a stunning performance as the vengeful angry Richard. Shot on film with a lot of handheld camera work the film has a vibrancy and immediacy that's lacking in what we see from Hollywood. Perhaps that just adds to the power of the film or makes it unconventional looking enough to make an impression either way despite the thick sometimes difficult to follow midland  accents the film builds to a powerful conclusion by the end of its nearly two hour running time.Those interested in extras read on the rest of you can skip this part. We get a featurette on the director Shane Meadows discussing his inspiration for and production of the film. We also get a commentary by Meadows, his star and co-writer Paddy Considine (who appeared on ""Cinderella Man"" recently) and producer Mark Herbert. It's an articulate and intelligent commentary track that occasionally strays to the obvious related to what we're seeing on the screen to discourse on the world that the trio drew inspiration from. We also get deleted scenes and an alternate ending for those that prefer to see director's second guessing themselves.A powerful, fascinating revenge drama ""Dead Man's Shoes"" is more than a cut above most movies of this type due to the intense performance of Considine (and exceptional support from the rest of the cast) and Meadows' perceptive observations about these individuals. Well made and directed Meadows and Considine both have a promising future ahead of them based on watching this fine film. Terrific film that I'd recommend renting before buying to see if this is a film that you will watch again.",4,"Powerful, intense and at time disturbing drama",1158278400,"09 15, 2006",2006,2645,"['God', 'will', 'forgive', 'let', 'Heaven', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'Richard', 'opening', 'monologue', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Shoes', '.Opening', 'disturbing', 'monologue', 'film', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Shoes', 'authentic', 'ring', 'portrayal', 'thugs', 'living', 'midlands', 'England', 'A', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'powerful', 'drama', 'revenge', 'Dead', 'man', 'Shoes', 'Richard', 'Paddy', 'Constantine', 'returning', 'military', 'vet', 'who', 'revenge', 'group', 'petty', 'drug', 'dealers', 'who', 'used', 'abused', 'developmentally', 'disabled', 'young', 'brother', 'terrorizing', 'appearing', 'gas', 'mask', 'military', 'fatigues', 'silently', 'beckoning', 'one', 'dealers', 'come', 'outside', 'then', 'apartment', 'gradually', 'private', 'little', 'war', 'What', 'unusual', 'film', ""n't"", 'standard', 'revenge', 'flick', 'Clearly', 'director', 'pulled', 'personal', 'experience', 'Evidently', 'was', 'skinhead', 'did', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'illegal', 'things', 'youth', 'people', 'how', 'think', 'talk', 'behave', 'Constantine', 'stunning', 'performance', 'vengeful', 'angry', 'Richard', 'Shot', 'film', 'lot', 'handheld', 'camera', 'work', 'film', 'vibrancy', 'immediacy', 'lacking', 'what', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'Perhaps', 'just', 'power', 'film', 'unconventional', 'looking', 'enough', 'make', 'impression', 'way', 'thick', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'follow', 'midland', 'accents', 'film', 'powerful', 'conclusion', 'end', 'nearly', 'two', 'hour', 'running', 'time.Those', 'interested', 'extras', 'read', 'rest', 'can', 'skip', 'part', 'get', 'featurette', 'director', 'Shane', 'Meadows', 'discussing', 'inspiration', 'production', 'film', 'also', 'get', 'commentary', 'Meadows', 'star', 'co-writer', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'who', 'appeared', 'Cinderella', 'Man', 'recently', 'producer', 'Mark', 'Herbert', 'articulate', 'intelligent', 'commentary', 'track', 'occasionally', 'obvious', 'related', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'screen', 'discourse', 'world', 'trio', 'drew', 'inspiration', 'also', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'ending', 'prefer', 'see', 'director', 'second', 'guessing', 'themselves.A', 'powerful', 'fascinating', 'revenge', 'drama', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Shoes', 'more', 'cut', 'most', 'movies', 'type', 'due', 'intense', 'performance', 'Considine', 'exceptional', 'support', 'rest', 'cast', 'Meadows', 'perceptive', 'observations', 'individuals', 'Well', 'made', 'directed', 'Meadows', 'Considine', 'have', 'promising', 'future', 'ahead', 'based', 'watching', 'fine', 'film', 'Terrific', 'film', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'renting', 'buying', 'see', 'film', 'will', 'watch', 'again']",N/A
