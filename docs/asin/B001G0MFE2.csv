Sigh! - if you consider getting this and are not sure what the show is about the above episode titles should give you a pretty good idea of what to expect.The plot - not to worry, no spoilers - seven years after her mother and a few others were whacked by this very bad and insensitive person, Abby Mills returns for the wedding of her best friend, Henry. But... soon enough, people start dying. Without revealing the plot, there's anywhere between 2 to 5 murdered guests per episode, disposed of in sometime imaginative ways: many get stabbed, shot or drowned, of course, but also we see guests chopped, cut in two, burned, cooked, impaled, sliced, chocked, hanged, incinerated, even crushed. Nobody is pummeled to death, poisoned or exploded. Agatha Christie? I don't think so. There's not much deductive investigation going on. Just follow the blood trail and keep alert for the screams.There is some blood and gore but it's all mostly good fun and there is the occasional humor relief and some sentimental stuff here and there but the three main questions that kept me watching episode after episode were WHO, WHY and HOW. In the end, the 'how' question turns out not to be that important. They just get killed, okay? And how is it possible for more than a dozen people to be brutally disposed of before anyone even begins to suspect something fishy is going on? Don't bother asking. As for the 'why'... without revealing the plot, some people are just crazy. Okay?In the end, this makes for pretty happy viewing for anyone who enjoys watching movies like 'Scream' (1, 2, 3... etc.) or 'I know what you did last summer' and its sequels. I won't say that it's suitable for children under 13 but explicit dismemberment scenes are not that many so, for a grown up, it's not that hard to watch.Good stuff.",5,Welcome to the wedding party,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,1910,"['Whap', 'Crackle', 'Ka-Blam', 'Bang', 'Thwack', 'Sploosh', 'Thrack', 'Splack', 'Sizzle', 'Gurgle', 'Seep', 'Snap', 'Splash', 'Gasp', 'Sigh', 'consider', 'getting', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'show', 'above', 'episode', 'titles', 'should', 'give', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'expect.The', 'plot', 'not', 'worry', 'spoilers', 'seven', 'years', 'mother', 'few', 'others', 'were', 'whacked', 'very', 'bad', 'insensitive', 'person', 'Abby', 'Mills', 'wedding', 'best', 'friend', 'Henry', 'soon', 'enough', 'people', 'start', 'dying', 'revealing', 'plot', 'anywhere', '2', '5', 'murdered', 'guests', 'episode', 'disposed', 'sometime', 'imaginative', 'ways', 'many', 'get', 'stabbed', 'shot', 'drowned', 'course', 'also', 'see', 'guests', 'chopped', 'cut', 'two', 'burned', 'cooked', 'impaled', 'sliced', 'chocked', 'hanged', 'incinerated', 'even', 'crushed', 'Nobody', 'pummeled', 'death', 'poisoned', 'exploded', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'not', 'much', 'deductive', 'investigation', 'going', 'Just', 'follow', 'blood', 'trail', 'keep', 'alert', 'screams.There', 'blood', 'gore', 'mostly', 'good', 'fun', 'occasional', 'humor', 'relief', 'sentimental', 'stuff', 'here', 'there', 'three', 'main', 'questions', 'kept', 'watching', 'episode', 'episode', 'were', 'WHO', 'WHY', 'HOW', 'end', ""'how"", 'question', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'important', 'just', 'get', 'killed', 'okay', 'how', 'possible', 'more', 'dozen', 'people', 'be', 'brutally', 'disposed', 'anyone', 'even', 'suspect', 'something', 'fishy', 'going', 'Do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'asking', ""'why"", 'revealing', 'plot', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'crazy', 'Okay', 'end', 'pretty', 'happy', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'who', 'watching', 'movies', ""'Scream"", '1', '2', '3', 'etc', 'know', 'what', 'did', 'last', 'summer', 'sequels', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'suitable', 'children', '13', 'explicit', 'dismemberment', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'so', 'grown', 'up', 'not', 'hard', 'watch.Good', 'stuff']",Harper's Island: The Edition

Everyone is excellent in his/her role. Some people I knew from other fav shows like Supernatural both Jim Beaver + Katie Cassidy star. As well as faces I haven't seen like Elaine Cassidy + C.J. Thomason. The entie show you're trying to figure out who the killer is. Yet everytime you think you have it pegged right that gets thrown out the window. Your fear for everyone when they leave the room or venture out on their own. No one is safe on Harper's Island everyone can be a victim or a killer. One character in particular I was rooting for his innocene the entire show even before doubt was cast on him(Yes he's uber hot but can you blame me). Things go from bad to extremely bad to still worse yet. It leaves you hanging till the final episode which was the best way to do it. If your a fan of mystery suspense thrillers than this is for you. It keeps you guessing + totally delivers above + beyond. You won't be disappointed just give it a look see. The only flaw is that it will definatley shy you away from relocating to a small island town for the rest of your life.,5,Perfect Cast for a Perfect Show,1300838400,"03 23, 2011",2011,1192,"['word', 'WOW', 'mini', 'series', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'down', 'last', 'character', 'Everyone', 'excellent', 'role', 'people', 'knew', 'other', 'fav', 'shows', 'Supernatural', 'Jim', 'Beaver', '+', 'Katie', 'Cassidy', 'star', 'As', 'well', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Elaine', 'Cassidy', '+', 'C.J', 'Thomason', 'entie', 'show', ""'re"", 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'killer', 'everytime', 'think', 'have', 'pegged', 'right', 'thrown', 'out', 'window', 'fear', 'everyone', 'when', 'leave', 'room', 'venture', 'out', 'own', 'one', 'safe', 'Harper', 'Island', 'everyone', 'can', 'be', 'victim', 'killer', 'One', 'character', 'particular', 'was', 'rooting', 'innocene', 'entire', 'show', 'even', 'doubt', 'was', 'cast', 'Yes', 'uber', 'hot', 'can', 'blame', 'Things', 'go', 'bad', 'extremely', 'bad', 'still', 'worse', 'yet', 'hanging', 'till', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'best', 'way', 'do', 'fan', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'thrillers', 'guessing', '+', 'totally', 'delivers', '+', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'just', 'give', 'look', 'see', 'only', 'flaw', 'will', 'definatley', 'shy', 'away', 'relocating', 'small', 'island', 'town', 'rest', 'life']",Harper's Island: The Edition

This is NOT a good mystery, more a mish mash from other films and TV shows especially Then There were None and Friday the 13th.I did, however, think that the details of the script were a bit amateurish. For one, the writers insisted on portraying women as spineless water Lilies. The number of opportunities these wilting flowers had to kill Mr. Wakefield and didn't take was unrealistic. Are they trying to tell me that there were no hairy-chested women, particulary women raised in the wild northwest, who wouldn't have wasted the bastard as soon as look at him?Another problem was the casting. The actors made the series look like a Revenge of the Nerds sequel rather than a gory murder mystery. My god, with the exception of Wakefield, the men in the series didn't look like they could pop a balloon much less defend themselves against a homocidal maniacand lets not get into the overuse woods!

When I heard that there was going to be a limited episode series (not a miniseries), I was immediately drawn to this show.The series premise is about a wedding party that is being held on the fictional Harper's Island, an island that has it's own share of past horror. (Seven years before the start of the show, a homicidal killer murdered several of the islanders in an intensely gruesome fashion.) Several of the wedding party members were on that island, including one who was the daughter of one of the murder victims. As the series progresses, several people die (at least one per episode) and old skeletons begin to be uncovered. As things and people are shown to be not what they seem to be, the tension becomes more & more apparent through the series.I personally loved this first episode. The episode starts just as everyone is heading to the island. Although everyone in the show seems to already know each other, there's enough backstory shown in the first few minutes to where the average viewer won't have a problem telling each person apart & getting into the story. The promised deaths in this episode are both pretty surprising, with one happening in the first part of the episode and the second occurring to one of the last characters I would have suspected.

They could have developed an interesting story line e.g. a fight over a wealthy estate between two parties but they simply refused to work on the plot.

As a result, I had never heard of this show until I saw it in the library.  Even though the description indicated there would most certainly be some killings, it also indicated this was predominantly a murder mystery.  Because of that and because it was ""not rated"", I kind of assumed it would be similar to an Agatha Christie movie...you know, entertaining and with some murders and a good mystery, but not too gory.Unfortunately, it wasn't until I'd watched a fair bit of this thing that I re-checked the back and finally found a teeny--I mean TEENY--tiny ""14M"" rating for Canada.  Had I been able to see that earlier, I wouldn't have watched this show at all as it seriously made me ill.There are some who have argued that ""Harper's"" didn't really show a lot of gore and that the impression of extreme violence had more to do with the sound effects.  Perhaps they are right.  I haven't seen ""Saw"", ""Friday the 13th"", ""Texas Chainsaw"", or similar splatter-horror movies, so I couldn't say how ""Harper's Island"" compares to those.  I can only say that, for myself, I found it completely nauseating.  After seeing/hearing a few people get hacked in half, beheaded, impaled, burned, etc I finally gave up as I just couldn't take any more.  Since I did not watch the rest, I have no idea how it ended.Based on the number of positive reviews, a lot of people obviously loved this show and thought it a great mystery.  Personally, I found it thin on the plot line/mystery aspect and felt its primary focus was one of gratuitous violence and immorality.  Whether the violence was more visual or implied with sound effects really doesn't matter to me--I hated it.

Slowly, however, members of their group start being killed off by something unknown...or could it be the ghost of John Wakefield, back to finish what he started all those years ago?It felt like the show was dragging on and on and it took people too long to realize that there were people actually dying all around them...not leaving the island to go back home (as they like to keep telling themselves).Excellent and kinda creepy twist at the end and I was very happy that I watched the whole show, despite the drop in ratings.

The producers certainly know how to get you going, though it takes a few episodes before they can start reeling you in and playing you the way they want to.At the very beginning there are too many characters--if you have ever seen Robert Altman's film A Wedding some of this will look familiar, but add into it a maritime setting, a fantastic yacht, and a culture of working class people trained to anticipate the needs of the wealthy, and you have a recipe for tension right there, and that's before you get the murders going.  The families of Trish Wellington (Katie Cassidy) and Henry Dunn (Christopher Gorham, often looking oddly like lean, lanky, nutty Anthony Perkins) invite you to a destination wedding, one held at Harper's Island somewhere in the Puget Sound, where you will be staying at the incredibly glamorous Candlewick Inn, but there will be plenty of time for slumming and seeing how the other half live.Chief among the main characters is our heroine, played by Elaine Cassidy, the Irish actress who made a splash in Atom Egoyan's Felicia's Journey ten years back.  As Abby, the daughter of the local sheriff (Jim Beaver), Cassidy plays the tragic survivor of a mass murder that rocked the island seven years ago.  Could the killer, John Wakefield, thought to have been shot down by Abby's dad, still be alive?  Has he gone back to his ways of hanging his victims from the trees?  For many episodes Fate and the unseen killer arrange it so that one by one, victims die but nobody really realizes it, thinking they have just gone back to Seattle and will return for the wedding ceremony.  That got a little hard to swallow, but during this period we began to sort out who was who, who's sleeping with who, who resents the power of who, who seems irretrievably scarred by the earlier murders, and something of the sociology.  Now we know the characters and it hurts when one of them dies.The show's gory in spots, soapy in others.  So violent is it that the individual episodes are named after comic book signifiers (""Ka-Boom,"" ""Thwack,"" etc) and after a few weeks you learn to wait for the act of violence each one stands for.  The ""Sizzle"" is particularly gruesome, though nothing yet matches the shocking death that takes place in the island's lovely old church.  I still get headaches when I think about that one!  Every clich&eacute; of this kind of slasher film is rehearsed here, but expertly and often with a twist.  Even the one where a medium reads the heroine's Tarot cards and suddenly sees something in them too horrible to put into words and she runs out of the room mumbling, ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry."" -Like the beginning of Agnes Varda's Cleo from 5 to 7!",5,Boing!,1244073600,"06 4, 2009",2009,2789,"['are', 'so', 'hooked', 'show', ""n't"", 'funny', 'must', 'be', 'tribute', 'writing', 'direction', 'producers', 'certainly', 'know', 'how', 'get', 'going', 'few', 'episodes', 'can', 'start', 'reeling', 'playing', 'way', 'want', 'very', 'beginning', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'film', 'A', 'Wedding', 'will', 'look', 'familiar', 'add', 'maritime', 'setting', 'fantastic', 'yacht', 'culture', 'working', 'class', 'people', 'trained', 'anticipate', 'needs', 'wealthy', 'have', 'recipe', 'tension', 'right', 'there', 'get', 'murders', 'going', 'families', 'Trish', 'Wellington', 'Katie', 'Cassidy', 'Henry', 'Dunn', 'Christopher', 'Gorham', 'often', 'looking', 'oddly', 'lean', 'lanky', 'nutty', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'invite', 'destination', 'wedding', 'one', 'held', 'Harper', 'Island', 'somewhere', 'Puget', 'Sound', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'staying', 'incredibly', 'glamorous', 'Candlewick', 'Inn', 'will', 'be', 'plenty', 'time', 'slumming', 'seeing', 'how', 'other', 'half', 'live.Chief', 'main', 'characters', 'heroine', 'played', 'Elaine', 'Cassidy', 'Irish', 'actress', 'who', 'made', 'splash', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'Felicia', 'Journey', 'ten', 'years', 'back', 'Abby', 'daughter', 'local', 'sheriff', 'Jim', 'Beaver', 'Cassidy', 'tragic', 'survivor', 'mass', 'murder', 'rocked', 'island', 'seven', 'years', 'ago', 'Could', 'killer', 'John', 'Wakefield', 'thought', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'down', 'Abby', 'dad', 'still', 'be', 'alive', 'gone', 'back', 'ways', 'hanging', 'victims', 'trees', 'many', 'episodes', 'Fate', 'unseen', 'killer', 'arrange', 'one', 'one', 'victims', 'die', 'nobody', 'really', 'realizes', 'thinking', 'have', 'just', 'gone', 'back', 'Seattle', 'will', 'return', 'wedding', 'ceremony', 'got', 'little', 'hard', 'swallow', 'period', 'began', 'sort', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'who', 'sleeping', 'who', 'who', 'power', 'who', 'who', 'irretrievably', 'scarred', 'earlier', 'murders', 'something', 'sociology', 'Now', 'know', 'characters', 'when', 'one', 'dies.The', 'show', 'gory', 'spots', 'soapy', 'others', 'So', 'violent', 'individual', 'episodes', 'are', 'named', 'comic', 'book', 'signifiers', 'Ka-Boom', 'Thwack', 'etc', 'few', 'weeks', 'learn', 'wait', 'act', 'violence', 'one', 'Sizzle', 'particularly', 'gruesome', 'nothing', 'yet', 'shocking', 'death', 'place', 'island', 'lovely', 'old', 'church', 'still', 'get', 'headaches', 'when', 'think', 'one', 'Every', 'clich', 'eacute', 'kind', 'slasher', 'film', 'rehearsed', 'here', 'expertly', 'often', 'twist', 'Even', 'one', 'where', 'medium', 'heroine', 'Tarot', 'cards', 'suddenly', 'something', 'too', 'horrible', 'put', 'words', 'room', 'mumbling', ""'m"", 'sorry', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'beginning', 'Agnes', 'Varda', 'Cleo', '5', '7']",Harper's Island: The Edition

Let me define ""we"": my junior high aged daughter, my 2 high school sons, my 20-something year old male co-worker, my 30-something year old fiance who HATES scary movies, an assortment of middle-aged ladies who work in my office, and me who loves reading thrillers and true-crime but hasn't watched a slasher movie since the Nightmare on Elm Street era of my youth.Harper's Island had enough gore for my kids to be riveted and enough character development (after the first few episodes) for those of us who covered our face when Uncle Marty crossed the bridge! Like an old-fashioned serial, you truly spent the week between each show wondering what that last plot twist could possibly mean and all of us had a slew of opinions on ""whodunit"".We had most of the episodes DVR'd since CBS did such an abysmal job of scheduling, promoting, and supporting this show. It was like playing ""hide and seek"" with the viewers just to watch each episode... very unfair! However, the recorded episodes let us go back after the finale and watch for things we missed or, more often, misinterpreted! We are so glad to have the entire series in one place.

One of those people was her mother.  But her father the sheriff (Jim Beaver) killed John Wakefield, and the island has gone back to normal.The reason Abby is returning is the wedding of her best friend Henry Dunn (Christopher Gorham) to the very wealthy Trish Wellington (Katie Cassidy).  But returning to the island means facing the past she's been hiding from.Unfortunately, murder once again rears its ugly head on the island.  Someone is killing the members of the wedding party off one by one in the same manner John Wakefield did all those years ago.  Is he really dead?  If so, who is doing the copycat murders?  And, more importantly, why?I don't mind telling you I was completely hooked on this show.  The first few episodes were rather light, but about episode 5 things picked up and never looked back.  I spent every episode on the edge of my seat wondering who was going to die next.  See, every episode included at least one murder.  This is a show that will thrill fans of the slasher genre.  It's intense and as gory as they could get away with on network TV.  The show was too crowded with characters at the beginning, but by the end, the victims were so well developed it was honestly heart breaking to see them die.Unfortunately, the show did suffer a little from its ties to the genre.  There were a couple of times the killer did something that made no sense other than advancing the plot.  And the ending was a bit out there.  But this is coming from someone who prefers straight mystery to slasher most of the time.

The acting is amazing with well defined characters for most part.  Considering the vast number of cast members this was no small task to accomplish.  Because the overwhelming number of cast were unknown to me when the show began, I found the actors to be believable.  Each of the characters is portrayed with their good and bad sides.  Thus everyone to some degree is a suspect and every character is psychologically well defined making the story feel intimate.  When the story is tied together at the end it is much sicker, but holds together in its' twisted insanity.If you love murder mysteries let alone serial murder mysteries let alone serial murder mysteries in two segments  over time, you will really love Harper's Island.

Horrible writing, direction, camera work, editing, sound, and acting only begin to describe this cheap ""Friday The 13th"" type series.  I was hoping for a smart thriller each week, but all I got was a cheap horror flick with very loud noises and ""scary"" music in place of the smart, edge-of-your-seat writing that should have been there.In the last episode we learn who the killer is.  What a whimp.  Gee pal, did ya have to go to so much trouble to kill everyone and confess your unrequited love to your childhood friend?  Then he is shocked when he is rejected!!!!  Why not just sink the boat on the way over and kill everyone at the same time and save us the excruciating pain of watching such a poorly written show.  Ya, I am bitter.  I am an optimist and hoped that each week a smart twist would surface and turn the series around.  Alas, I did nothing more then waste 2.5 months of time on this dreck.Some found the humor in such a poorly written show and I am happy for them.  I'll admit that I did laugh at the casting of Henry (Christopher Gorham) Trish's (Katie Cassidy) soon to be husband.  C'mon nowhere in the universe would that chick even give the time of day to that guy.  It showed too, there was negative chemistry between these two so-called actors.  Campy acting and some of the ways these twits were killed was worth a chuckle now and again.  I guess I was wanting too much for this to be a smart show.  Uh, CBS is a garbage network, so in the end I guess I am not surprised.  Maybe the joke was on us.  Who knows?  Ratings for the entire series were in the tank so I hope CBS took a bath on it.For those of you who missed the series do not buy.

1192565,A1THEQV9LKFN35,B001G0MFE2,racapowski,"[4, 6]","Television executives these days face an unenviable quandary  -  shows are getting obnoxiously expensive to produce, yet TV viewership is dwindling.  What to do?  Producer Ari Schlossberg concocted a solution  -  a limited-run series populated by unknown (yet capable) actors where the plot, not the stars, takes center stage.  The network fills a time slot cost-effectively, young actors get national exposure, and the viewers get an original new show.  Everybody wins!I wish that were the case.  ""Harper's Island"" is a capital concept, an ""And Then There Were None"" mystery spanning thirteen episodes, and when the show works, it's a fun and riveting nail-biter.  But, man, does the first half try your patience.We open on twentysomething Abby Mills, about to attend her best friend's wedding in her misty, mossy hometown of Harper's Island.  The occasion is joyous, but the location holds bad memories for Abby  -  seven years ago, her mother was murdered with five others when a local man lost his marbles.  Mom's death fractured the family, and Abby's been estranged from her father ever since.  Before you can say ""awkward reunion"", however, trouble descends upon our wedding party  -  someone on the island has vociferous objections to the nuptuals, which they've decided to voice with a loud, drunken speech at the ceremony.Oh, wait.  I meant by killing the visitors one by one.Anyone who's read ""And Then There Were None"" knows that the key drama comes from the characters' knowledge that they are trapped in a remote location and that there is a killer among them  -  the fear, the paranoia, the us vs. them problem-solving in a group attempt to survive.  ""Harper's Island""'s central failing is that it takes atrociously long to get to that point.  The show wastes its first several episodes on jejune subplots with characters destined for the axe  -  the jock wants to steal the nebbish's girlfriend!  The old-money patriarch's new wife is sleeping with her stepdaughter's husband!  You can throw out a few such scenes in a 90-minute horror cheapie to denote for whom we should feel sorry when they get bisected by a machete, but you can't expand them proportionately in a 13-episode series, wasting time and viewer goodwill on shallow, irrelevant plots obviously destined to go nowhere.  Only a random murder at hour's end keeps the first half of the program in the mystery/horror genre, and the narrative has to jump through ridiculous hoops to keep the characters unaware that they're being stalked by a killer (""Man, there must be some SERIOUS drug dealers on this island!"").  Though the cast boasts 25 suspects, only a handful are serious contenders, and the massive number of characters needed to stock the filler eps prevents the core cast from receiving screentime and development.  Mysteries should be tense and thrilling, but for its first half, ""Harper's Island"" spins its wheels, all bloat and would-be titillation cribbed from the CW.Once the show sheds all this, though, it begins to deliver on the promise of Schlossberg's idea.  There's a manhunt conducted in the secret passages of an old inn that's really suspenseful and balances multiple perspectives well, and a siege in a restaurant that features a lot of desperate brainstorming.  Tense sequences spanning 10+ characters are effectively directed, while cinematography ably showcases the spooky island setting, all dim Northwest fog and overgrowth.  The performances are perfectly serviceable (though Abby's love interest is hostile and unappealing at inappropriate spots, and the guy who plays Best Friend's Brother needs to dial his Goofy Meter back to -93), and a few deserve special mention: Elaine Cassidy as Abby shoulders the show capably; Katie Cassidy as the bride has a quiet intensity; Matt Barr as the groom's frat-boy friend takes an initially obnoxious role and gives it real pathos by the end; and the mild-mannered doctor played by Adam Campbell has a few moments that're heartbreaking.The story lands a few audacious gut-punches, and some small moments surprise.  A mad killer performs the most unexpected feat  -  holding a touchingly human conversation  -  while at one crucial juncture, a couple smart characters appear to do something colossally stupid  -  but before I could shout, ""No, you fools!"", they'd turned the tables on one of mystery's oldest cliches.  Characters actually grow in the crisis: a jerk becomes a shrewd and capable defender, and a quiet and reserved gentleman is grandly brave.  I was surprised at how attached I had grown to the core cast by the end, and how unnerved I was when they were in mortal danger.  The writers do resort, however, to some achingly transparent devices to prolong matters  -  the dying choke out cryptic clues instead of their killer's name, and in its Slasher Roshambo, Knife beats Shotgun way more often than it should.  Also, would it be sour grapes to suggest that the solution is incorrectly chosen?  It seems like a last-minute substitution in the penultimate ep for what would've been a smashing killer; the replacement was never meant to play a psychopath, and the final showdown, despite a few quiet, eerie charms, is sadly limp, with a frustratingly passive heroine.Despite this, I wish ""Harper's Island"" could gather a following and a second chance through DVD like ""24"", but it takes so long to get going that I fear many will bail before the good parts.  If a show has to hook you by a couple episodes in, then I can't recommend it.

1192566,A3IYSIAKYOMKTO,B001G0MFE2,Renter,"[5, 5]","Harper's Island is an experiment in limited run series on American TV, a format that is fairly common in international markets but not often seen on this side of the pond.The show, which will run through July 2nd, follows a wedding party that is celebrating on a beautiful island with a terrible past.  The overarching plot is pure slasher flick, while the subplots tend toward the soapy.  The combo works much better than it has any right to, because I am hooked.Another facet of the show's charm is the ensemble cast, which is a who's who of supporting cast from shows on the CW, Fox and the SciFi channel.  But don't get too attached to your favorites, because they're slated to be picked off one at a time by the mysterious killer.The premiere episode won me over with its combination of creepy atmosphere and ""It's that guy!

1192567,A3H3OKW4NDOYLQ,B001G0MFE2,Rock God,"[7, 7]","I apologize in advance for a lengthy review, but I feel there's a lot that needs to be said about this.  For starters, I would give this much higher than 5 stars if the option were available.I watched this show on television from week to week, hating the long weekly wait before I got my Harper's fix.  I admit the first few episodes are very characteristic of a soap opera with all the typical ""good-looking"" characters and back stories and just the way it played out overall.  So yes, at first it was a guilty pleasure.  What can I say though, the characters were very likable from the start and I was intrigued with the premise and promise of weekly murder that would add to the mystery.  However, after a few episodes it stopped being a guilty pleasure as it was a truly suspenseful (and yes, violent) murder mystery.  Every week we got a more in depth look at the characters and were constantly trying to figure out who the killer might be.  I honestly can't recall having so much fun watching television in...well forever.I know some would say this is a Friday the 13th ripoff, but please don't insult this series by comparing it to the likes of F13.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the Friday the 13th movies ever since I was younger, but this isn't very much like those at all.  This is more complex with a well scripted story.  Yes, there is a deranged killer on the loose dispatching the wedding guests in various, gruesome ways.  But that's as far as the similarities go.  If you go to see Friday the 13th, expect some mindless fun with some cheap scares and pretty pathetic acting and script.  If you watch Harper's Island, expect a fantastic story, fantastic character drama, and exceptional acting (for the most part) that would rival if not surpass most of what you could even see in movies that make it to theaters.I absolutely had to read the one star reviews on this to see how ANYONE could possibly consider this ONE STAR.  The general consensus between ALL of those reviewers was either that this was too violent, or that reality television is better.  Reality television is better?!?!?!? Need I say more?  As far as the violence goes, YES, this is extremely violent compared to what viewers would normally see on prime-time television.  There's no excuses for that, and the producers didn't try to make any.  They were simply making it more horrific and suspenseful by showing just how deranged the killer is to be setting up such elaborate killings for the guests.  I for one didn't think it was overboard, especially considering the other kind of muck they allow on television.  It's rather hypocritical to say this was too violent and not have a problem with other shows that flaunt promiscuous behaviors, foul language, 2/3 butt/breast visibility, and a whole host of other things that are too far removed from what should be allowed on network television.  And that's just standard channels.  I won't even describe the kinds of filth I've seen on cable channels like Comedy Central or the likes.That argument aside, I truly can't say enough good things about this show.  It actually plays a lot less like a show and more like a nine or ten hour movie.  So yes it's lengthy, but it's only one season long and you know the whole time there will be closure at the end of the story.  As far as the horror genre goes, I actually like this SHOW better than almost ANY horror MOVIE I've ever seen.  It's truly amazing.  And yes, there are some plot holes and a few moments where you're wondering just what those fodder-worthy characters are thinking, but what movie/show doesn't have some moments like that?I thought the cinematography, writing, directing, setting, and most of the acting was about as perfect as any horror outing can hope to achieve. There were a few characters who weren't quite up to par with the rest as far as acting, but then there were some truly exceptional performances that you just don't expect to see on a television show.  Among those with great performances were the characters of Henry, Trish, Shane, Richard, Mr. Wellington, Sully, Cal, Shea, etc...  I was also pretty impressed (though to a slightly lesser extent) with Chloe, Abby, Malcolm, Danny, etc...  Like I said though, there were a few weaker performances, but I won't go into that cause they weren't AWFUL, and when you're watching you'll be able to spot them rather easily anyway.In case you're not aware already, the setting is Harper's Island.  More specifically, the Candlewick Inn and surrounding areas for the most part.  The wedding for Henry And Trish is being held and all the guests have arrived.  However, someone is killing the guests and other members of the wedding party one by one in the same manner that the notorious serial killer John Wakefield killed his victims on the same island just seven years before.  You as the viewer have 13 episodes (actually 11 or 12 since the killer is revealed before the finale) to figure out who the killer is.  Maybe less if you're good at that sort of thing.  Or maybe not at all if you just want to enjoy the mystery as it goes along.I watched this once when it first aired and loved every minute of it.  I watched it again on Netflix last month over the course of a week.  It was just as good as I remembered, if not better the second time around.  I can see myself watching this many more times to come as it is just THAT good.  It's the kind of show you want to not only watch over again, but tell others about and share the fun with them too.  This is truly destined to be a cult classic, though to some it's already an instant classic.Initially, the thought was to renew this for a second season if it did well, just with a different cast and setting and of course a new murder mystery to solve.  However, ratings weren't great and so that idea went right out the window.  Taken as it is; a one season spectacle; I'm more than happy with the end result.  Of course, I certainly wouldn't argue if there were to be a Harper's season 2, so long as they could put together another finely crafted murder mystery.  Maybe the producers/networks will realize that ratings aren't everything and if you give a show time it WILL eventually catch on (unless of course it's just dreadfully awful). Long story short, give this a shot if you can stomach the ample violence because it's well worth the watch. Television (and cinema in general) at it's finest.  10/10",5,"Don't Worry, There's No Spoilers....",1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,6419,"['apologize', 'advance', 'lengthy', 'review', 'feel', 'lot',

Childhood sweeties Henry and Trish have invited friends and family for a week of fun on the island where they grew up. The revels are set to culminate in a plush ceremony at the island's renowned bed and breakfast. But something nasty is afoot even before the wedding party arrives on the island, and soon guests and loved ones are running in all directions to avoid being picked off by a killer whose skills and hand tools appear to be limitless.The CBS horror/mystery Harper's Island is a 13-episode, one season series. Creator Ari Schlossberg delivers a fun and gory mystery in which all loose ends will be tied up and all questions answered by the final scene.

1192571,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B001G0MFE2,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","Harper's Island was a Mini-Series on CBS in the summer of 2009. Had it been in a decent time slot or debuted in the fall, this would have been a huge franchise. Instead this unique and exciting show was buried due to bad ratings. Harper's Island is a small island off the coast of Washington state, where rich people come to vacation, a small fishing village exists, and it was the home to a serial killer. 7 years earlier, John Wakefield killed 6 people on Harper's Island including Abby's mother. Now she is returning home for the first in 7 years for the wedding of her best friend. Harper's Island is back to normal, Wakefield is long dead, and all that remains are memories...Until people start dying again. The show is terrific, full of twists and turns and all kinds of things you won't see coming. I love shows that keep you guessing and make you think, however the one drawback of this show is that it was in fact designed as a mini-series. There is so much good stuff here, but they only have 13 hours to tell the story, so a lot of it is rushed and at points it feels like you're watching a soap opera. I wish the network saw the potential and took this gem and made it into a series, but they didn't. Harper's Island is hardly remembered now, 4 years later, but it was a show that was clever, fast-paced, and adored by its fans. The true killer of Harper's Island is Nielsen, as once again the ratings killed a gem in the making.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,1441,"['Harper', 'Island', 'was', 'Mini-Series', 'CBS', 'summer', '2009', 'Had', 'been', 'decent', 'time', 'slot', 'debuted', 'fall', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'franchise', 'Instead', 'unique', 'exciting', 'show', 'was', 'buried', 'due', 'bad', 'ratings', 'Harper', 'Island', 'small', 'island', 'coast', 'Washington', 'state', 'where', 'rich', 'people', 'come', 'vacation', 'small', 'fishing', 'village', 'was', 'home', 'serial', 'killer', '7', 'years', 'earlier', 'John', 'Wakefield', 'killed', '6', 'people', 'Harper', 'Island', 'including', 'Abby', 'mother', 'Now', 'returning', 'home', 'first', '7', 'years', 'wedding', 'best', 'friend', 'Harper', 'Island', 'back', 'normal', 'Wakefield', 'long', 'dead', 'are', 'memories', 'people', 'start', 'dying', 'again', 'show', 'terrific', 'full', 'twists', 'turns', 'kinds', 'things', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'love', 'shows', 'keep', 'guessing', 'make', 'think', 'however', 'one', 'drawback', 'show', 'was', 'fact', 'designed', 'mini-series', 'so', 'much', 'good', 'stuff', 'here', 'only', 'have', '13', 'hours', 'tell', 'story', 'lot', 'rushed', 'points', ""'re"", 'watching', 'soap', 'opera', 'wish', 'network', 'saw', 'potential', 'took', 'gem', 'made', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'Harper', 'Island', 'hardly', 'remembered', 'now', '4', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'show', 'was', 'clever', 'fast-paced', 'adored', 'fans', 'true', 'killer', 'Harper', 'Island', 'Nielsen', 'once', 'again', 'ratings', 'killed', 'gem', 'making']",Harper's Island: The Edition

I just want to say that this is something that will keep you entertained while guessing all through.The plot here is that a large group of people go to this island of the coast of Seattle called Harpers Island (there is no character named Harper) for a wedding of 2 former locals. But seven years before, a killer named John Wakefield went on a rampage to murder several people. The main character (played by Elaine Cassidy) Abby Mills, whose mother was one of the victims, will return to the island as the best friend of the groom Henry Dunn (Christopher Gorham) after being shipped away by the town sheriff, her father who killed Wakefield. When she returns to the island, unknown murders start to occur.The exciting part is a different person gets murdered every episode and you need to figure out who the killer is. Is it Wakefield, risen from the dead or is it somebody from the wedding party. The two turning points are the first murder to be seen by the party and when the flower girl ends up missing and when the search begins, they end up stranded on the island in the ultimate form of survival.Overall, this is truly amazing. Any horror fan should watch this DVD set. It consists of 13 episodes, deleted scenes and extras.

1192575,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B001G0MFE2,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[3, 3]","In the summer of 2009, CBS tried its hand at some original programming by airing HARPER'S ISLAND. The concept of the show was that of a murder mystery that would last for only 13 episodes and by the end of the 13th episode a complete story would be told. The cast of characters was large, but each week one by one the characters would be killed by a murderer who was one of the characters on the island; basically it's an updating of Agatha Christie's 10 LITTLE INDIANS with a little bit of gore & sex thrown in for good measure as well as a few clich&eacute;s of the horror genre.Trish Wellington (Katie Cassidy) and Henry Dunn (Christopher Gorham) are getting married at the place the met as kids, Harper's Island. Henry came from a working class family and only spent his summers on the island while Trish was from the very wealthy, prestigious, and respected Wellington clan. It's the classic story of the poor boy from the other side of the tracks falling in love with the well-to-do uptown girl. The wedding couple has decided to be married at Harper's Island because that is where they first met. However, Harper's Island isn't the happy place of their childhood. Seven years ago a serial killer named John Wakefield murdered six people on the island before being shot by the local sheriff. One of his victim's was the mother of Abby Mills (Elaine Cassidy), Henry Dunn's best friend. The wedding party and guests arrive one by one to the Wellington yacht in the Seattle harbor that will ferry them away to Harper's Island. However, before the boat leaves we discover one guest has not yet arrived and before the first commercial break the missing guests meets his doom and becomes victim #1. As the show progresses, we learn that almost everyone in the wedding party has a secret. These secrets are revealed throughout the 13 episodes and as they are uncovered the number of possible suspects increases. Of course, this only lasts so long as one by one the possible suspects are killed off, too.I was surprised how much I enjoyed HARPER'S ISLAND. I recently watched the entire series over a two-day period while I was sick and recuperating in bed. I had intended to take more time to watch the series, but after the first few episodes, I was completely sucked in. I was most impressed by the deep level of character development for most of the characters in the series. The horror genre is not known for having great characters; in most horror stories the characters are staple caricatures or archetypes: the boyfriend, the beauty queen, the jock, the good girl, the outcast, etc. Initially, since there's such a larger cast (there are 25 major characters at the beginning), HARPER'S ISLAND begins this way. However, things don't stay this way for long. After the first three episodes or so, each of the characters evolve from being a caricature into a fully-formed character that acts like a real life person. Some of the character arcs that take place are extremely emotional and moving.There's a little gore and some sex, but since the show aired on network television, it's relatively light. Until later in the show most of the deaths occur off screen; people are killed in violent ways, but through the magic of sound effects you don't see what actually happens but you know what happened. Sound is a huge element as illustrated by the title of each episode being onomatopoeia; for example ""Twack"", ""Ka-Boom"", etc.I really enjoyed HARPER'S ISLAND. The show does contain some of the basic horror clich&eacute;s and there's a little bit of typical horror cheese-dialogue in each episode. However, the overall story and the development of the characters makes for a great viewing experience. CBS would have had a major hit on their hands if they had aired the show in the fall instead of trying to use it as summer filler. It's a show that I think as time goes on, more and more people will be wondering why another variation of the series has never aired.For a tv show that only lasted for 13 episodes, the DVD includes a ton of extras including four episodes with commentary from the producers and actors, tv promo spots, four featurettes, and the entire 16 webisodes of the ""Harper's Globe"" series that parallels the story of HARPER'S ISLAND. ""Harper's Globe"" isn't anywhere near the quality of the tv show, but it does provide a little bit of exposition (we actually get to meet the 1st victim of Harper's Island) and increase the overall body count. There's also at least one deleted or extended scene for six of the episodes. One of the most interesting things that I discovered in watching the series was that other than a few exceptions, none of the actors knew when they would be leaving the show until the week the script that their character was killed off was released. There are regular tv shows that have been on for years that don't have as many extra features in all of their season sets combined as HARPER'S ISLAND has in its one season.",5,Why Did CBS Cancel This

With friends and family all ready to party and celebrate a holy matrimony, some strange goings-on (e.g. killings) begin.  Are they related to the old murders?Basically, &#34;Harper's Island&#34; is a murder-mystery with a HUGE emphasis on the murder.
