760387,A20WIVFZ3EIX0W,B00009ZY9E,"Amazon Customer ""Trig42""","[6, 6]","The funniest parts of this show are so uncomfortable that you don't know whether you should laugh or cry. But in the end your darker sense of humor will get the better of you, and you'll find yourself laughing at things you've never dared find humorous before.That being said, Ricky Gervais is a comic genius. Not only does he play Boss David Brent to his painfully pleasurable perfection, but his improv skills are untouchable; timing impeccable. Gervais admits in the supplementary interviews on disc 2 that his sole purpose in this show is to improvise so much (and so well) that he'll cause the other actors to break out into laugher mid-take. The cast and crew hate him for it, but can't get enough of it nonetheless.Over the first season of The Office, we meet the employees of Wernham Hogg, the paper company where ""life is stationery."" Manager David Brent is a boss so dumb, yet so happily innocent and friendly, he has no concept that he disgusts and traumatizes everyone he meets. Meanwhile, self-proclaimed Team Leader Gareth is a caricature of every nightmare co-worker you've every worked with, all rolled into one unbearable character. Tim is the textbook every-man, so fed up with his co-workers he wants nothing more than to leave this horrible chapter of life behind and start over. However, he is kept there by Dawn the soft-spoken receptionist, the girl he loves that unfortunately belongs to another man.The mockumentary style of the show is much like that of Reno 911. It's set up like a reality show, but rather you get a parody of reality. However, with The Office, the humor is at times so dark and so unexpected, you can barely watch. It certainly has a cringe-factor like nothing I've ever experienced in television. The show is definitely NOT for everybody, so if that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, stay away.On disc 1, you get all 6 half-hour episodes. Disc 2 has a few deleted scenes and a behind-the-scenes documentary. The documentary is very much worth watching, not only for the outtakes, but also for Gervais's discussion of improv on the set. There isn't much here for extras, but it seems very adequate for a mere 3-hour series.Depending on your sense of humor, one of two things will happen after seeing this show. You could, of course, hate this show entirely due to the increasingly uncomfortable humor. But if that's not the case, it will raise the bar for comedy far beyond what you know. I think this is an amazing show in its uniqueness and fortitude. It truly goes where no comedy has gone before. If Season 2 is even half as good, it too will be another winner.",5,Painfully Hilarious,1092614400,"08 16, 2004",2004,2612,"['funniest', 'parts', 'show', 'are', 'so', 'uncomfortable', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'should', 'laugh', 'cry', 'end', 'darker', 'sense', 'humor', 'will', 'get', 'better', ""'ll"", 'find', 'laughing', 'things', ""'ve"", 'never', 'dared', 'find', 'humorous', 'being', 'said', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'comic', 'genius', 'Not', 'only', 'play', 'Boss', 'David', 'Brent', 'painfully', 'pleasurable', 'perfection', 'improv', 'skills', 'are', 'untouchable', 'timing', 'impeccable', 'Gervais', 'supplementary', 'interviews', 'disc', '2', 'sole', 'purpose', 'show', 'improvise', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'well', ""'ll"", 'cause', 'other', 'actors', 'break', 'out', 'laugher', 'mid-take', 'cast', 'crew', 'hate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'first', 'season', 'Office', 'meet', 'employees', 'Wernham', 'Hogg', 'paper', 'company', 'where', 'life', 'stationery', 'Manager', 'David', 'Brent', 'boss', 'so', 'dumb', 'yet', 'so', 'happily', 'innocent', 'friendly', 'concept', 'everyone', 'Meanwhile', 'self-proclaimed', 'Team', 'Leader', 'Gareth', 'caricature', 'nightmare', 'co-worker', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'rolled', 'one', 'unbearable', 'character', 'Tim', 'textbook', 'every-man', 'so', 'fed', 'up', 'co-workers', 'nothing', 'more', 'leave', 'horrible', 'chapter', 'life', 'start', 'However', 'kept', 'there', 'Dawn', 'soft-spoken', 'receptionist', 'girl', 'unfortunately', 'man.The', 'mockumentary', 'style', 'show', 'much', 'Reno', '911', 'set', 'up', 'reality', 'show', 'rather', 'get', 'parody', 'reality', 'However', 'Office', 'humor', 'times', 'so', 'dark', 'so', 'unexpected', 'can', 'barely', 'watch', 'certainly', 'cringe-factor', 'nothing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'experienced', 'television', 'show', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'everybody', 'so', ""n't"", 'sound', 'cup', 'tea', 'stay', 'away.On', 'disc', '1', 'get', '6', 'half-hour', 'episodes', 'Disc', '2', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentary', 'documentary', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'only', 'outtakes', 'also', 'Gervais', 'discussion', 'improv', 'set', ""n't"", 'much', 'here', 'extras', 'very', 'adequate', 'mere', '3-hour', 'series.Depending', 'sense', 'humor', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'will', 'happen', 'seeing', 'show', 'could', 'course', 'hate', 'show', 'entirely', 'due', 'increasingly', 'uncomfortable', 'humor', 'not', 'case', 'will', 'raise', 'bar', 'comedy', 'far', 'what', 'know', 'think', 'amazing', 'show', 'uniqueness', 'fortitude', 'truly', 'where', 'comedy', 'gone', 'before', 'Season', '2', 'even', 'half', 'good', 'too', 'will', 'be', 'winner']",The Office: The Complete First Series

Classic British understatement, irony and self-mockery.Pokes fun at a rather typical, middle aged, undereducated, white male ekeing it out in an obscure middleman business in a former superpower nation.He is aggressive, overselling, sales-oriented, puffery-prone, necessarily blind to his faults, lonely, desperate, not searching for meaning, and vain.I was just laughing and laughing.  Weeks later, I catch myself thinking about the four main characters and where they are now, that's how thoroughly and richly characterized they are.  Just felt they were real people at a very real boring office job in a most unglamorous smallish town.  Shocked to find that they are real actors who have had other acting gigs in other movies and the theater.These British actors did not undergo plastic surgery or expensive hair and teeth jobs, and that adds to their believability as office workers.  Also adds to their charm - they love themselves and their culture.  They don't need enhancements.  They have real dialogue instead.I will not watch another American tv series again, not with its obvious humor and its tabloid-obsessed, steroid enhanced, plastic boobed stars.

The actors' expressiveness fills the awkward silences to great effect. Many real issues and themes about life, politics of sexuality, gender and of course, politics of work environments, are embedded within the plotlines, anecdotes and jokes. It's refreshing to watch a show this funny, where the structure and writing feel real, and do not insult the viewer's intelligence. Unfortunately, there are only two seasons in this series. From personal experience working in several urban offices, I think there's enough people with stories and situations out there, that the writers could have found more material and created one more strong season. On the other hand, the writers do a fabulous job with maintaining the integrity of the show. They  develop the stories and reveal the characters within the series in a seemingly natural progression.

In the UK, this is as popular there as Curb Your Enthusiasm (which shares similar dark appeal) and approaching Friends.  I had to take a look, despite the fact that I never really liked British humor.The first episode was more confusing than anything else.  Done in a documentary style, it chronicled the goings on within, of all interesting venues, a paper company, and followed the relationships between its completely pathetic inhabitants.  The office constituency is led by (co-writer of the show) Ricky Gervais who plays David Brent...a cocktail of extreme insecurity, arrogance, and level of social ineptitude that pushes (but doesn't cross) the envelope of possibility.I'll embarrasingly admit that the unorthodox style took a while to get used to, from no laugh track, to a complete absence of jokes or punch lines.  This show plays on a variation of the axiom about &quot;truth being stranger than fiction&quot;.  Well, after an episode or two, I became totally immersed in the environment, an environment that seemed more like reality than fiction.  That threw my switch, I now find this show insanely funny, but the realistic element has a gravity of its own.  You start to really care about the characters.

760398,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00009ZY9E,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 7]","When an American version of the Office was announced, there was a feeling of ""ugh, another show getting ruined"". Everyone kept saying the British one was better even though they liked the American one too so I checked out that one and found it insanely funny and even touching. Well naturally, the British version has to be just as good right? While I did find it enjoyable to a degree, there's a certain aspect to the humor that feels lost on me; whether it's British humor, underdeveloped secondary charracters or certain aspects that didn't get enough time, the British version of the Office is enjoyable in its own right but I tend to prefer the American one.The show centers on the paper company Wernham-Hogg in the town of Slough. The place is run by David Brent, a self-proclaimed hilarious man who truly believes everyone thinks he's a great boss and a funny one to boot. His right-hand man (he thinks he's Assistant Manager but he's really Assistant TO the Regional Manager) is Gareth Keenan, an incredibly odd man who has a tendency to show strange behaviour and see David as a kind of mentor. Also in the office is Tim, a 30 year-old who feels his life is being wasted selling paper. He has a secret crush on Dawn, the office receptionist, who is engaged to an inconsiderate oaf of a man named Lee. Shot documentary style, we see the ins and outs of the day-to-day life of the people in the office.The show as a whole is kind of like a comedy show but without wisecracking humor in the vein of Friends or Everybody Loves Raymond. The humor is rather centered on the knowing parts of life where you can think ""I know someone exactly like that"". Much of the show's humor comes from Brent himself, since he just seems unaware that he's not funny at all but wholeheartedly believes that people just love the guy. That leads into embarassing situations where he'll make a fool of himself in front of people. In one scene, he pretends to fire Dawn for stealing but he intended it as a joke where everyone can have a laugh. When she renounces him and calls him a sad man, he's completely ignorant to what he's done.Well, how is this version different compared to the American one? Well the Michael Scott role (the David Brent counterpart) is more of a well-intentioned but incompetent boss; someone who knows people don't laugh at him but he shrugs it off and shoulders on anyway. You can see Michael sometimes take it hard when a joke goes awry but then he'll get right back at it and try again whereas David almost has a egoist grin and a completely misguided view of himself, like too much pride. A joke doesn't work? Just keep plugging away until he decides to leave. Meanwhile the Tim/Dawn romance is well-developed but not enough since it almost comes across initially as one-sided with Tim loving Dawn but she's not quite at the level he is. Pam on the other hand loves Roy but you got the feeling she'd much rather be with Jim if she could escape Roy's clutches. Jim is way more mischievious and full of pranks with Pam even in on a bulk of them while Dawn is almost amused by them.Not only does the events surrounding the characters change but sometimes the character itself. Tim uses humor because what else does he have? Jim is quite popular with the ladies so he uses humor because it's fun for him. The other change is the character of Gareth, his American counterpart being Dwight Schrute. Quite frankly, Gareth is too gangly and just plain creepy that you wonder why someone didn't pop him one. He gives off an uncomfortable vibe whenever he's around. Dwight on the other hand is an oddball but a lovable one; one whose quirks amuse even if it's for the wrong reasons. Not to mention the secondary characters in the British one are kind of forgettable.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[5, 6]","If you crossed &quot;Office Space&quot; with &quot;Spinal Tap,&quot; you might end up with something like &quot;The Office.&quot; This hit British comedy defies the usual sitcom rules, and brings us into the cringingly dull world of a paper corporation, all delivered with straight-faced wit and hilarity.Wernham Hogg is a suburban paper corporation, a stunningly dull place to work. And presiding over it is David Brent (Ricky Gervais), a wannabe comic who claims to be a pal to all the people under him, despite driving them all up the wall. There's also his partner in crime, vaguely corpse-like Gareth (Mackenzie Crook), the downtrodden everyman Tim (Martin Freeman), and the beautiful Dawn (Lucy Davis), whom Tim hopelessly longs for.In the first season, David is informed that either his branch or another branch are going to be eliminated. If his branch is eliminated, some people will be downsized, and others relocated. The employees -- including Tim and Dawn -- reexamine their lives as they struggle to survive in the day-to-day chaos, including a Web porn scandal, a quiz competition, giant inflatable genitals, drunken carousing, inter-office romances, and Gareth playing detective.Don't expect a typical sitcom in &quot;The Office.&quot; No laughtracks. No punch lines. No gag humor... well, not much. And no episode has a clear-cut ending. Instead, we have the format seen in &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; and the Christopher Guest mockumentaries -- hidden cameras watching the madness. And what those cameras see is enough to make the world's cubicle-dwellers cry.The series gets off to a slightly bumpy start -- at first, the jokes are a bit too thinly-spread. But soon &quot;The Office&quot; gets its footing and the humor steadies itself (&quot;Tim's put my stapler inside a jelly again. That's the third time he's done it!&quot; Gareth complains, displaying the stapler in a Jell-O mold). And a lot of the humor is a subversive, subtle kind -- it creeps into your mind, and by episode two you'll be laughing your head off at David's bad jokes and veiled prejudices.Ricky Gervais is brilliant. David is every bit as annoying and obnoxious as the immortal Basil Fawlty, but hides it under a genial mask and stupid jokes. Mackenzie Crook is wonderful as the obsequious boot-licker. Tim, like Dilbert, is a lovable loser who can't get himself out of his soul-sucking job. And Dawn is mired in a relationship with an obnoxious cheapskate.More subtle and yet goofier than American sitcoms, &quot;The Office&quot; is a unique slice of British humor.

760409,A1RJJ56MBJMX87,B00009ZY9E,Gavin Wilson,"[3, 4]","When this series was first shown in the UK, there were some who assumed it was a documentary, possibly a management education programme filmed by the BBC Business Unit.  There is no laughter track, and there are frequent shots of people doing not very much and photocopiers collating paper.  The first-line manager (David Brent) was so incompetent that this must be the 'Before' section before the consultants moved in and transformed the company.But no, once viewers got it, and saw that David Brent was never going to improve (and would never do any work either), the BBC realised it had a major winner on its hands.But perhaps the most extraordinary part of the story is that the BBC should give total control of the writing, direction and acting to Ricky Gervaise and his collaborator Stephen Merchant.  Ricky Gervaise, a fortysomething, had had no acting or directing experience.  He had never been to acting or scriptwriting classes.  His only contact with the media was in the 1980s when he was a member of a failed pop group.  Before he made this series, he was the manager of the students union bar at one of the London university colleges.What happened was that, for his graduate training course at the BBC, Stephen Merchant had to create a 10-minute short.  With Gervaise, he created a prototype of the Office, and the BBC liked it so much that they gave the partnership a series.  It's hard to imagine that happening in the US, which tends to value training and experience rather more highly.In truth, Gervaise plays a character very close to his own persona.  Here is a manager who plays the guitar and wants to be a comedian.  It is that closeness to reality that lends the series such a genuine feel.  Also contributing to the feeling of reality is the sparseness of comic characters.  There are only two seriously abnormal people in that office -- Brent himself and Gareth, the weekend soldier with a penchant for childish electronic toys.

Such is the genius of the BBC comedy &quot;The Office&quot;, slowly taking the US by storm, by being both brilliantly funny and wickedly sincere.The brain child of Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, &quot;The Office&quot; brings us into the exciting world of the paper business, led into battle by the horribly camera-mugging David Brent (played by Gervais), who is aptly clueless in his verbal running-of-the-mouth. Acutely aware of the cameras which have invaded his office, making his work life into a pseudo-reality show. Brent is fidgety aware of the camera, often looking it during one of his hilarious monologues, and also as he attempts to &quot;be one of the guys&quot; in the office. The results are not punch-line funny, but deeper truth funny.Adding to Brent's insanity are a supportive cast of incredible actors that add so much to the Office. Martin Freeman's Tim, who plays the office clown but also carries the more melancholy aspects of his job with him; Mackenzie Crook's Gareth, as a perfect foil to Tim as a brown nosing assistant with a huge inferiority complex; Lucy Davis' Dawn, a strong-willed receptionist who I secretly suspect is the smart one of the bunch.; to the rest of the office staff who are required to act by looking, and the looks they give are pricelessly funny.What I began to appreciate about the series is that beyond the humor, the people in the office are terribly real. It's in their realness that the humor trannscends. When we see Dawn burst into tears because of an inappropriate practical joke Brent plays on her, when we see Tim brooding in the local bar because of his situation, when we see Brent caught in the middle of some lies he tells to save face; it's funny, and painful, and more strong because these people are real, complex. The humor comes from them, and doesn't happen to them, which is more real.The first season is only six episodes, but worthy of the price for the many, many, many laughs The Office will bring you. I eagerly can't wait for the second season, and hope that American comedies learn something from this series destined to be a quiet classic.",5,If going to the office would only be this fun and funny...,1083369600,"05 1, 2004",2004,2335,"['moment', 'David', 'Brent', 'screen', 'suddenly', 'bad', 'boss', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'ever', 'hated', 'ever', 'doing', 'anything', 'horribly', 'offensive', 'rotten', 'bad', 'bosses', 'have', 'done', 'Such', 'genius', 'BBC', 'comedy', 'quot', 'Office', 'quot', 'slowly', 'taking', 'US', 'storm', 'being', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'wickedly', 'sincere.The', 'brain', 'child', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'Stephen', 'Merchant', 'quot', 'Office', 'quot', 'exciting', 'world', 'paper', 'business', 'led', 'battle', 'horribly', 'camera-mugging', 'David', 'Brent', 'played', 'Gervais', 'who', 'aptly', 'clueless', 'verbal', 'running-of-the-mouth', 'Acutely', 'aware', 'cameras', 'have', 'invaded', 'office', 'making', 'work', 'life', 'pseudo-reality', 'show', 'Brent', 'fidgety', 'aware', 'camera', 'often', 'looking', 'one', 'hilarious', 'monologues', 'also', 'quot', 'be', 'one', 'guys', 'quot', 'office', 'results', 'are', 'not', 'punch-line', 'funny', 'deeper', 'truth', 'funny.Adding', 'Brent', 'insanity', 'are', 'supportive', 'cast', 'incredible', 'actors', 'add', 'so', 'much', 'Office', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'Tim', 'who', 'office', 'clown', 'also', 'more', 'melancholy', 'aspects', 'job', 'Mackenzie', 'Crook', 'Gareth', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Tim', 'brown', 'nosing', 'assistant', 'huge', 'inferiority', 'complex', 'Lucy', 'Davis', 'Dawn', 'strong-willed', 'receptionist', 'who', 'secretly', 'suspect', 'smart', 'one', 'bunch', 'rest', 'office', 'staff', 'who', 'are', 'required', 'act', 'looking', 'looks', 'give', 'are', 'pricelessly', 'began', 'appreciate', 'series', 'humor', 'people', 'office', 'are', 'terribly', 'real', 'realness', 'humor', 'trannscends', 'When', 'see', 'Dawn', 'burst', 'tears', 'inappropriate', 'practical', 'joke', 'Brent', 'when', 'see', 'Tim', 'brooding', 'local', 'bar', 'situation', 'when', 'see', 'Brent', 'caught', 'middle', 'lies', 'save', 'face', 'funny', 'painful', 'more', 'strong', 'people', 'are', 'real', 'complex', 'humor', ""n't"", 'happen', 'more', 'real.The', 'first', 'season', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'worthy', 'price', 'many', 'many', 'many', 'laughs', 'Office', 'will', 'bring', 'eagerly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'second', 'season', 'hope', 'American', 'comedies', 'learn', 'something', 'series', 'destined', 'be', 'quiet', 'classic']",The Office: The Complete First Series

Ricky Gervais is stellar and plays the part of the pathetic and hopelessly self-deluded David Brent to perfection; add a terrific supporting cast and you have a show that will hold up to repeated viewings and achieve classic status much like ""Fawlty Towers"".  Why four stars from me?  The inclusion of some pretty raunchy dialog which some may enjoy while others need to know about so they can be careful watching around the kiddies.

Ricky Gervais is so brilliant as the creepily funny David Brent,you WILL actually feel more than a bit uncomfortable and embarrassed for him when he 1)tries too hard to be funny or 2)when he's so clearly unaware of the hole that he's digging that it becomes surreal. And that's the beauty of this show:Take a total idiot meanie of a boss and combine it with the mundane day to day goings-on of working in Corporate(office politics seem to be identical on both sides on the Atlantic) and you immediately recognize the similarities to real life.While David Brent is the linchpin of the show,the characters of Tim,Dawn and Gareth are also essential.A classic play on the office crush subplot(Salesman Tim pines for the lovely but unobtainable receptionist Dawn)grows at a mild but always interesting pace that it reaches a brilliant fever pitch by the second season. And you'd feel bad for Brent's suck-up subordinate Gareth if the practical jokes played on him by Tim weren't so damn funny. Another plus for this series:no laugh track/studio audience to spell out to you what jokes are funny,no gimmicks or situations for the characters to work out(ala ""Friends"")and no political correctness. It really is reminscent of ""Fawlty Towers""or ""Curb your Enthusiam""so if you're a fan of either of those,you shouldn't find any problem with ""The Office"".

760426,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00009ZY9E,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[19, 19]","Every time David Brent (Ricky Gervais) starts fiddling with his tie I get anxious.  It is like hearing the sound of an artillery shell coming at you and wanting to yell ""Incoming.""  Yes, I know I am contrasting a visual clue with an aural clue, but my point, vis-a-vis ""The Office: The Complete First Series,"" would be, to wit, on point in the same way taking a round hole and finding a square peg to put into it would make a modicum of sense, in a round about way.We live sheltered lives up here in the Northland, so I had never seen ""The Office"" nor heard much about it until the BBC series won the Golden Globe for Best Television Series: Musical or Comedy and Gervais won for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series: Musical or Comedy.  But that was enough to check it out.  Since this is a British situation comedy there are only a handful of episodes, six to be exact, so we are spared from the sub-par and totally wasted episodes that so many American sitcoms are bloated with (is there going to be even one more great ""Friends"" episode before the grand finale?).  The result is an instant cult classic in the mode of ""Police Squad,"" another limited run sitcom series that inhabited its own little comedy world.""The Office"" is the Slough office of Werham Hogg, manufacturer of paper products, where David Brent is the office manager.  The key story arc of the first season is the company's impending decision to close either the Slough or Swindon branches and merge the two, which brings up the dreaded idea of ""redundancy.""  Brent talks about protecting his people but we are aware from the start that this guy is talk, all talk, all the time, and has achieved new levels of self-interest and self-absorption in the process.  There are also the interpersonal conflicts in the office, where the number two man in the office, Gareth Keenan (Mackenzie Crook) is blind to his own incompetence and Tim Canterbury (Martin Freeman) divides his time between making life difficult for Gareth, trying to connect with Brent's secretary Dawn Tinsley (Lucy Davis), and keeping on the good side of the man himself.The six episodes from the first season consist of: (1) ""Downsize"" is where Brent is told that his branch might be closed down and absorbed by the other office.  Of course that would not be a popular thing to tell his workers, so Brent flies in the face of reason and tells them the exact opposite; (2) ""Work Experience"" presents Brent with two headaches, the first being a doctored pornographic image of himself sent over the company computers and the second a return visit from Jennifer Taylor Clark wanting to know what changes he has made to improve the office; (3) ""The Quiz"" starts with Tim's birthday and his various gifts (one of which is large and inflatable), but comes down to Tim and Ricky (Oliver Chris) against Brent and Finch (Ralph Ineson) in the office's annual trivia quiz contest; (4) ""Training"" is my favorite of the bunch as it is training day.  Of course Brent cannot play second fiddle to anybody and it is not long before he is livening up the boring session with some of his original musical compositions; (5) ""New Girl"" has Brent firing and hiring as the deadline for a decision comes closer while Tim is thinking of moving on; and (6) ""Judgement"" deals with redundancies judgement day and the choice that Brent has to make.  Of course, no selfish deed comes unpunished.My only complaint is that given how Jennifer Taylor Clark (Stirling Gallacher) saw through Brent in episode two, how she can come back in episode four and have a different attitude.  I know the short answer is because Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant wrote it that way, but it only underscores that for ""The Office"" to work nobody above Brent on the corporate food chain can really know his true value.  Done in mockumentary style, just another piece of evidence that Brent's ego is too great to ever see the harm of having his every word being recorded by a camera, ""The Office"" is ultimately about a man who is trying to have it both ways.  Every time he tries to stay ahead of the game he falls farther and farther behind, with the one constant being that he basically never ever shuts up.  There is just something so compelling about watching such verbal self-immolating, especially when we are only talking about six episodes where only the fifth one is less than completely satisfactory.",5,"Ricky Gervais unleashes David Brent on ""The Office""",1078185600,"03 2, 2004",2004,4410,"['time', 'David', 'Brent', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'fiddling', 'tie', 'get', 'anxious', 'hearing', 'sound', 'artillery', 'shell', 'coming', 'wanting', 'yell', 'Incoming', 'Yes', 'know', 'am', 'contrasting', 'visual', 'clue', 'aural', 'clue', 'point', 'vis-a-vis', 'Office', 'Complete', 'First', 'Series', 'would', 'be', 'wit', 'point', 'same', 'way', 'taking', 'round', 'hole', 'finding', 'square', 'peg', 'put', 'would', 'make', 'modicum', 'sense', 'round', 'way.We', 'live', 'sheltered', 'up', 'here', 'Northland', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Office', 'heard', 'much', 'BBC', 'series', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Best', 'Television', 'Series', 'Musical', 'Comedy', 'Gervais', 'won', 'Best', 'Performance', 'Actor', 'Television', 'Series', 'Musical', 'Comedy', 'was', 'enough', 'check', 'out', 'British', 'situation', 'comedy', 'are', 'only', 'handful', 'episodes', 'six', 'be', 'exact', 'are', 'spared', 'sub-par', 'totally', 'wasted', 'episodes', 'so', 'many', 'American', 'sitcoms', 'are', 'bloated', 'there', 'going', 'be', 'even', 'one', 'more', 'great', 'Friends', 'episode', 'grand', 'finale', 'result', 'instant', 'cult', 'classic', 'mode', 'Police', 'Squad', 'limited', 'run', 'sitcom', 'series', 'inhabited', 'own', 'little', 'comedy', 'world', 'Office', 'Slough', 'office', 'Werham', 'Hogg', 'manufacturer', 'paper', 'products', 'where', 'David', 'Brent', 'office', 'manager', 'key', 'story', 'arc', 'first', 'season', 'company', 'impending', 'decision', 'close', 'Slough', 'Swindon', 'branches', 'merge', 'two', 'up', 'dreaded', 'idea', 'redundancy', 'Brent', 'talks', 'protecting', 'people', 'are', 'aware', 'start', 'guy', 'talk', 'talk', 'time', 'achieved', 'new', 'levels', 'self-interest', 'self-absorption', 'process', 'are', 'also', 'interpersonal', 'conflicts', 'office', 'where', 'number', 'two', 'man', 'office', 'Gareth', 'Keenan', 'Mackenzie', 'Crook', 'blind', 'own', 'incompetence', 'Tim', 'Canterbury', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'time', 'making', 'life', 'difficult', 'Gareth', 'trying', 'connect', 'Brent', 'secretary', 'Dawn', 'Tinsley', 'Lucy', 'Davis', 'keeping', 'good', 'side', 'man', 'six', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'consist', '1', 'Downsize', 'where', 'Brent', 'told', 'branch', 'might', 'be', 'closed', 'down', 'absorbed', 'other', 'office', 'course', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'popular', 'thing', 'tell', 'workers', 'so', 'Brent', 'flies', 'face', 'reason', 'exact', 'opposite', '2', 'Work', 'Experience', 'presents', 'Brent', 'two', 'headaches', 'first', 'being', 'doctored', 'pornographic', 'image', 'sent', 'company', 'computers', 'second', 'return', 'visit', 'Jennifer', 'Taylor', 'Clark', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'made', 'improve', 'office', '3', 'Quiz', 'Tim', 'birthday', 'various', 'gifts', 'one', 'large', 'inflatable', 'down', 'Tim', 'Ricky', 'Oliver', 'Chris', 'Brent', 'Finch', 'Ralph', 'Ineson', 'office', 'annual', 'trivia', 'quiz', 'contest', '4', 'Training', 'favorite', 'bunch', 'training', 'day', 'course', 'Brent', 'can', 'not', 'play', 'second', 'fiddle', 'anybody', 'not', 'long', 'livening', 'up', 'boring', 'session', 'original', 'musical', 'compositions', '5', 'New', 'Girl', 'Brent', 'firing', 'hiring', 'deadline', 'decision', 'closer', 'Tim', 'thinking', 'moving', '6', 'Judgement', 'deals', 'redundancies', 'judgement', 'day', 'choice', 'Brent', 'make', 'course', 'selfish', 'deed', 'unpunished.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'given', 'how', 'Jennifer', 'Taylor', 'Clark', 'Stirling', 'Gallacher', 'saw', 'Brent', 'episode', 'two', 'how', 'can', 'come', 'back', 'episode', 'four', 'have', 'different', 'attitude', 'know', 'short', 'answer', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'Stephen', 'Merchant', 'wrote', 'way', 'only', 'Office', 'work', 'nobody', 'Brent', 'corporate', 'food', 'chain', 'can', 'really', 'know', 'true', 'value', 'Done', 'mockumentary', 'style', 'just', 'piece', 'evidence', 'Brent', 'ego', 'too', 'great', 'ever', 'see', 'harm', 'having', 'word', 'being', 'recorded', 'camera', 'Office', 'ultimately', 'man', 'who', 'trying', 'have', 'ways', 'time', 'stay', 'ahead', 'game', 'farther', 'farther', 'one', 'constant', 'being', 'basically', 'never', 'ever', 'up', 'just', 'something', 'so', 'compelling', 'watching', 'such', 'verbal', 'self-immolating', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'only', 'talking', 'six', 'episodes', 'where', 'only', 'fifth', 'one', 'less', 'completely', 'satisfactory']",The Office: The Complete First Series

It is a mockumentary, a comedy specifically designed to LOOK like a bird's eye view of the everyday activities of a British paper merchant.  The irony is that these actors have more depth and personality than any ""character"" from shows like The Real World and Big Brother.The cast is led by Ricky Gervais (who also co-writes) as regional manager David Brent, an ultimately sleazy boss who spends more time trying to be witty than he does managing his staff.  His battles with political correctness are hilarious, as he is very aware that a camera is following him.  His right hand man is Gareth (Mackenzie Crook), a former army lieutenant who believes he has more company power than his assistant regional manager (I mean, assistant TO the regional manager) position truly entitles.  Gareth spends most of his day pestering Tim (Martin Freeman), an obviously bored sales associate who always has a witty comment to add to any conversation.  Dawn (Lucy Davis), a receptionist engaged to marry a warehouse worker, is the object of Tim's affection and the victim of one of Mr. Brent's cruelest practical jokes in the pilot.Each cast member is some sort of caricature of a person you might see in your own workplace.  The situations they come across could happen to anyone (lay-offs, sexual harassment, jokes via company e-mail, romances, et cetera).  This show is kind of like ""Spinal Tap"": it fools you for a second to believe that this office could exist.  And there's no whining, no drama for the camera's sake, no huge mansions for seven people to argue in.  It's just these people, going about their days, doing their jobs.  And it couldn't be more brilliant or side-splittingly funny.This DVD features every episode from the first series, which is great if you only get to sporadically catch episodes or moments on BBC America.  There are also funny deleted scenes, with explanations from the writers as to why they were cut, and a 30-minute featurette.If you have not yet discover this delightful British import, I strongly recommend you check it out.

It manages to be hilariously funny without making you laugh, instead you cringe and squirm with embarrassment at David Brent and his 'enlightened' take on senior management. It's funny, but also painful to watch. It's hilarious but the laughs are few and far between. Maybe it's because its too close to the bone - anybody who's worked in an office environment in the 80s or 90s will most likely have first-hand experience of the buffoonery that passes for leadership.It's a good job Gareth is there - we can all laugh at his inept social skills and lack of any kind of redeeming feature - because otherwise the Office would be close to unbearable so close is the line between comedy and blackness. Take Brent's chum Finchy, for instance. You can't laugh at a guy like that, you just pray you never have to meet anyone like him. The Office mimics the earnest mockumentary style of Spinal Tap but is less far-fetched and therefore more scary.

You get ""The Office,"" the British sitcom that is ferociously breaking into American culture. This 2 DVD set contains the first season of ""The Office,"" as well as a behind the scenes documentary of the making and creation of the show. Enjoy it now before we have the sure-to-be stupid American version of it on NBC or ABC, which will likely perform about as well as the disastrous ""Coupling"" import.""The Office"" shows us the day-to-day lives of the employees of Wernham Hogg paper company, led by the insufferable boss David Brent (Ricky Gervais, the shows co-writer and co-creator). While David is usually the focus of each episode, the show contains a very deep supporting cast, including Gareth, the military-trained assistant-to-the-manager, Tim, the anti-Gareth, who he's constantly warring with, and his in-office romantic interest Dawn, the everyday-pretty secretary.If you are familiar with the films of Christopher Guest - Waiting For Guffman, Spinal Tap, Best In Show, A Mighty Wind - then you'll be right at home with ""The Office."" It's filmed in the simplistic and usually funny ""mockumentary"" style. For reasons never named in the show, there are cameramen throughout the Wernham Hogg offices filming the daily activities of all the employees, as well as conducting frequent and insightful interviews with the characters.Enough of that - here's why the show is brilliant: You know everyone in the cast. At one time or another, you have met David Brent. Maybe he was your own boss once. Gareth was that psycho kid in study hall that always read Guns and Ammo and always insisted on showing you some Judo throw he'd recently learned. Tim is the nice guy that the pretty girls always took advantage of. You'll even see aspects of yourself in all the characters.And it's the characters that make this show such a success. When you watch the first episode, you'll laugh a few times, a chuckle here and there. Then the second episode will yield more laughs as you get to know the quirks of the characters a little more. By episode three, everything becomes funny. It's this fact that makes it difficult to introduce the show to people, since it contains a great deal of humor that is only funny once you're familiar with the characters.The runaway star of the show is Gervais as David Brent. He has a world-class ability to always say the wrong thing at the right time. More than anything he is proud of his comedic ability and cherishes this as the highest virtue of corporate bosses. The problem? He's not funny. Not intentionally anyway. Every joke is carried too far and in the course of trying to be England's most politically correct man, he manages to insult practically every race and every woman in the office.Lastly, this DVD is worth buying not only for the repeat watching value, but also for the behind-the-scenes look at the show, which is almost funnier than the episodes themselves. Both Gervais and co-director Stephen Merchant are hilarious throughout it and you realize that Gervais can't not be funny. You get interviews with all the important cast, and you'll see several minutes of brilliant outtakes where the actors can't get three lines into the scene before losing it.The only negative reviews of the show speak to the similarity of the episodes and that they are hard to distinguish between one another. This might be valid, but I don't necessarily think it's a negative factor. In the DVD itself, the episodes are not separated but are listed as a sequence of scenes, six per episode. This says it more clearly than I ever could - the shows are all meant to be taken as one continuing episode, much like the monotonous days of office labor. I think it's one of the more reality based shows I've seen, unlike another recent reviewer who thought Seinfeld was more realistic. That's too stupid a comment to even defend here. The bottom line - if you work in an office, you'll instantly recognize the humor in your own day to day life.

Then there's Curb Your Enthusiasm, a not so &quot;Enthusiastic&quot; show about not so interesting people in staged/improved situations (although there is a basic script.  But Larry David, and Improve Comic, much prefers his take on it, even if it's rather humorless and tasteless).  Then, a gem comes along like &quot;The Office&quot;.Is it a documentary?  Is it a TV show?  Is it reality tv?  In essence, it doesn't really matter.  On a basic level, it's about the chaos that ensues in a location that no one really wants to be working at in the first place...it's where 90% of people here and abroad will end up working...and it's a place for very high tension.All of these factors working together produce very funny situations that are both played as low key events and high brow or mid range farce (again, very subdued).  They stretch reality on some level.  But on some level, you bring yourself to believe that something like this could &quot;actually&quot; happen.

It is hilarious, smart, and innovative to say the least. The premise of the show is excellent: a faux documentary of employees of a paper merchant company near London. The camera follows the workers in their daily interactions with each other and with their dodgy office manager, David Brent. Anyone who has worked in an office environment can easily relate to the drudgery depicted in this show. The employees have to endure David Brent with his canned management lingo along with the antics of Gareth, 'the team leader' and David's pet. David is arguably the best depiction of an incompetent supervisor to date. While striving to bring humor into the workplace and be everyone's pal he ends up insulting many and comes off as a genuine jerk. The plots are simple yet brilliant. There is little action involved but the acting and writing behind this show always succeed in filling an entire episode with sidesplitting funny scenarios. My personal favorite episodes include the one with the doomed training session and also the one with the mocked up pornographic picture of David that was circulated around the office and Gareth's attempt of finding the perpetrator. (Just thinking about these episodes makes me laugh...)Many people claim that the cult classic OFFICE SPACE is the best show depicting the absurdity of cubicle work, but I believe that OFFICE SPACE does not even touch the talent and genius of THE OFFICE. Watching all six episodes of the first season will guarantee a good laugh.

Into this environment comes a T.V. crew set on making a fly-on-the-wall documentary about office life. That documentary is what we see. This media attention is a dream come true for the manager David Brent, who is convinced his entry into office life has been a tragic loss to the world of show business, and comedy in particular. He's wrong: he isn't funny. His jokes fall into an oblivion of silence and embarrassment. And yet he is also right as this idle, incompetent, selfish, petty, stupid and self-deluded character, as played by Ricky Gervais, is one of the most painfully, appallingly hilarious creatures ever dreamt up and put on a T.V. screen.If Brent is a monster, he remains perhaps quite likeable compared to his best mate, the appallingly obnoxious ""Finchy"" and his second in command Gareth, the ""team leader"". Gareth, brilliantly acted by Mackenzie Crook, is a character, like Brent, largely defined by his Walter Mittyish fantasy of who he would like to be. In Brent's case the fantasy is the Comic Genius, in Gareth's it is The Soldier. He is the perfect representation of the hopeless loser whose sad macho fantasies of being Jean Claude van Damme get played out hilariously scaled down in the appallingly petty landscape of his life.This really ought not to be funny. It's less like watching most comedy than it is like watching a horrible road accident in slow motion. It is desperately funny, the way some passages in Samuel Beckett are desperately funny. It's a picture of modern British (and I suspect not only British) working life at its most unspeakably awful and a study in how not to go about being a human being. What mainly makes it funny is simply that it is so completely brilliant. The writing by Gervais and Stephen Merchant is as good as has ever been done for television by anyone. With a deadly knack for social observation and a marvellous ear for dialogue (and monologue), they have created a wonderful collection of characters who are at once utterly monstrous and utterly believable. That done, they have then managed to get these parts handed out to actors who have managed simply to become them with total credibility. British television comedy has produced nothing better than this. (And the preceding sentence would still be true with the word ""British"" removed.)",5,Appalling. Terrifying.

David Brent thinks he's the most popular and comical Boss in the whole of the UK, if not the world. To add to his self delusion, Gareth Keenan (Mackenzie Crook) plays Teacher's Pet and spurs on Brent's rude and sometimes obnoxious behaviour.Playing the voice of reason is Tim Canterbury (Martin Freeman) who out of all the characters we can relate to the most. As he does the slight looks to camera, as if asking if we can see the torment he goes through everyday in this office. While playing the Juliet to his Romeo is Dawn Tinsley (Lucy Davis) the receptionist of Wernham Hogg who also shares the same ideals as Tim and tries to keep sane by illustrating. She is caught between the Boss's rude and not so wise cracking jokes and the love that was never meant to be between herself and Tim.There are six episodes in the first season, each 30 minutes long. Six episodes you may not think is enough but The Office has mastered something that most other sitcoms have not, Quality over Quantity. And I think this shows by the series beating out the other sitcoms in the Golden Globe Awards who are in their final seasons.The first time you watch this show you'll be in amazement at the Idiosyncrasies that each of the four main protagonists convey. You will also no doubt relate one of the stars to someone in your own workplace and cringe at what they do just to impress the camera. When watching this show, I find, that you don't think of it as a sitcom, you actually think of it as a real workplace being captured on film in a documentary style. Its just so believable.Below are a brief summary of each of the episodes.Episode 1 - Here we are introduced to the office workplace and the people involved. A young protege (Ricky) is also brought in for work experience as David Brent tries to lay down how relaxed and great the office is even though there has been word that the branch may be downsized.Episode 2 - David hires Donna, a family friend's daughter and shows her around the office. While doing so he finds that his head has been photoshopped onto a pornagraphic image. Gareth is sent to find the culprit.Episode 3 - Here we witness Quiz night at Slough and see how truly awful people can get when liquored up and in a competition environment. The quiz night boils down to a head to head between Brent and Finch V. Ricky and Tim on his 30th Birthday.Episode 4 - To help keep good teamwork in the office a workplace seminar in conducted. Brent reveals that he is a singer/songwriter while Rowan tries to keep the seminar moving. Dawn and her Boyfriend (Lee) have a falling out while Tim quits his job and asks out Dawn.Episode 5 - Gareth gives Donna Health and Safety Training while Brent hires a new secretary even though he's supposed to be downsizing. All the Office goes down to a local nightclub, Chasers, while David tries to get lucky with the ladies.Episode 6 - Jennifer (Head Boss) informs David that either his branch or Swindon's branch will be downsized depending on if he accepts the role of UK manager or not.EXTRAS - 40 minute documentary of how the Office was made and Deleted Scenes.The Office hits on a simple yet universal relationship with love and work. Everyone can relate to being in a job that they hate and people who don't work as hard being promoted before they do.This is the first British show that has ever been nominated for 2 Golden Globes and wins them both first time (Best TV Comedy, Best Comedy Actor).

Ricky Gervais (writer, lead, creator) stabs into the heart of the common man's working environment with a 'mock-u-mentary' (faux documentary using comedy; this is 'Spinal Tap' for the office worker) about the office of a British paper distrubution franchise.  Caught in tedium, these no-where people generally are caught trying project larger images of themselves, openly admit they are boring, or try to rip down others putting up facades.  The 6 episodes cover great, unfathomed material the jaded and decadent Hollywood crowd could scarcely relate to.  It begins with the District Manager alerting David Brent (Gervais) that cutbacks are rolling down the line to his office, and allows this sword of Damocles to hang over the staff until the resolve in the final episode. Inbetween we get to see Brent and his excellently written/acted staff play out truely horrid moments with employee's night out at a club, training day (the best episode by far), hiring a secretary, and a staffer's pathetic 30th birthday party.

I will say that I do enjoy the show's unique approach and starkly arid humor that is presented with no attempt to point up the comedy, which is simply left to the viewer to find. While it is often compared to This Is Spinal Tap, because of its documentary style, The Office is more like a Beckett-infused version of NewsRadio. The show is not very accessible to a new viewer, since no introductions are made, and there is little deliberate exposition, but this also contribute to the reality of it. Ultimately, this is the central issue addressed in the DVD.The biggest inclusion on the DVD is the Wernham-Hogg &quot;newsletter&quot; that includes profiles on all the major and most of the minor characters, which is helpful breaking viewers in. More important is an extensive &quot;Slough Speak&quot; dictionary, which helps the Yanks (like myself) understand the heavy British slang that is used, and provides perspective on many choices in the series (like why it is located in Slough). The is actually printed out, not throw on the DVD (like some other purchases I ave made) so that you can have it out while you watch.The second disc includes a documentary on the makng of, which features Ricky Gervais bizarrely staying in character (I hope. If the real Ricky is that much like David Brent, this comedy becomes sadder indeed.) which contributes to overall odd-funny atmosphere of the show.

This is evident (Series 2 is good, nothing like Series 1, though) and this is also why we will only ever have 12 episodes plus one Christmas Special.Sure there are many Brit 'in-jokes' that the average American will not get but there is so much more than they will not distract you from laughing.",5,Classic Television,1069113600,"11 18, 2003",2003,1091,"['When', 'Office', 'was', 'first', 'shown', 'UK', 'audience', 'back', '2001', 'was', 'shown', 'BBC2', 'secondary', 'BBC', 'channel', 'where', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'popular', 'are', 'first', 'aired', 'surprise', 'then', 'when', 'Office', 'was', 'repeated', 'audience', 'share', 'was', 'much', 'greater', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'good', 'reputation', 'long', 'way.Gervais', 'Merchant', 'hit', 'spot', 'DVD', 'containing', '6', '30', 'minute', 'episodes', 'comprise', 'Series', 'One', 'as', 'well', 'lengthy', 'interview', '2', 'complete', 'outtakes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'early', 'verions', 'Office.The', 'timescale', 'Series', 'only', 'few', 'weeks', 'so', 'much', 'crammed', 'here', 'training', 'days', 'nights', 'out', 'Brent', 'philosophical', 'musings', 'camera.Merchant', 'Gervais', 'admitted', ""'d"", 'run', 'out', 'ideas', 'Series', '2', 'evident', 'Series', '2', 'good', 'nothing', 'Series', '1', 'though', 'also', 'why', 'will', 'only', 'ever', 'have', '12', 'episodes', 'one', 'Christmas', 'Special.Sure', 'are', 'many', 'Brit', ""'in-jokes"", 'average', 'American', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'will', 'not', 'distract', 'laughing']",The Office: The Complete First Series
760456,A24YVJWNLBU314,B00009ZY9E,Trevor Seigler,"[3, 6]","Like a lot of newer fans to the British ""Office"", I came to the show via the American version which began airing this year. It would be fair to say that I prefer the American version, simply because it's the best thing currently on the air (now that ""Arrested Development"" has died a cruelly young death). But I'm man enough to admit that the original isn't too shabby either. I'm a grown-up, unlike most of the Brit original fans who rag on the American one.The set-up is thus: David Brent is the manager of a paper company in a London suburb with the attractive name of ""Slough"". His underling, Gareth Keenan, is a weasly little kiss-butt. Tim and Dawn, the star-crossed couple of the office, have to deal with the immovable object known as Dawn's fiancee Lee. And around them, all sorts of characters both unique and easily recognizable hover throughout the day, bored to tears but still in fear of losing their jobs due to rumored ""downsizing"".The show is built on the notion that Brent hogs the camera and makes the show his personal enterprise, spouting out all sorts of praise on himself. The fact that he emerges not as the genius and lovable manager that he thinks he is makes the show tick. It's his buffoonery that the show relies on.Maybe it's just because I watched the American version first, but I found that the focus on Brent took away from a lot of the secondary-character development that the NBC show nailed. You get a feel for David, Gareth, Tim, and Dawn, but the others seem on the periphery of the action. The NBC version has managed to make the characters other than the main quartet accessible and human. Here, they are but faces in the crowd, blocked out by David's antics. Quite a few moments occur when some of the characters do emerge as human beings with their own stories, but the focus on all things Brent doesn't allow for much more than a few choice lines and awkward moments.That being said, the show works for what it is, a satire of the workplace enviroment. In a company that essentially pushes paper, there's little else to feel secure about. It's not as if these people can measure how productive their days are by looking at their output. So they are bored, and looking for things to do to alleviate that. The workplace is a showcase for their antics.This, the first season of the British original, is chock-full of hilarious moments that will make you laugh out loud or cringe in horror. Is it better than the American version? I'll just say that the shows work on their own levels, and the Brit version is truly an original worth catching.",4,I Would Eat A Monkey If I Had To,1132099200,"11 16, 2005",2005,2583,"['lot', 'newer', 'fans', 'British', 'Office', 'came', 'show', 'American', 'version', 'began', 'airing', 'year', 'would', 'be', 'fair', 'say', 'prefer', 'American', 'version', 'simply', 'best', 'thing', 'currently', 'air', 'now', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'died', 'cruelly', 'young', 'death', ""'m"", 'man', 'enough', 'admit', 'original', ""n't"", 'too', 'shabby', ""'m"", 'grown-up', 'most', 'Brit', 'original', 'fans', 'who', 'rag', 'American', 'one.The', 'set-up', 'thus', 'David', 'Brent', 'manager', 'paper', 'company', 'London', 'suburb', 'attractive', 'name', 'Slough', 'underling', 'Gareth', 'Keenan', 'weasly', 'little', 'kiss-butt', 'Tim', 'Dawn', 'star-crossed', 'couple', 'office', 'have', 'deal', 'immovable', 'object', 'known', 'Dawn', 'fiancee', 'Lee', 'sorts', 'characters', 'unique', 'easily', 'recognizable', 'hover', 'day', 'bored', 'tears', 'still', 'fear', 'losing', 'jobs', 'due', 'rumored', 'downsizing', '.The', 'show', 'built', 'notion', 'Brent', 'hogs', 'camera', 'show', 'personal', 'enterprise', 'spouting', 'out', 'sorts', 'praise', 'fact', 'not', 'genius', 'lovable', 'manager', 'show', 'tick', 'buffoonery', 'show', 'just', 'watched', 'American', 'version', 'first', 'found', 'focus', 'Brent', 'took', 'away', 'lot', 'secondary-character', 'development', 'NBC', 'show', 'nailed', 'get', 'feel', 'David', 'Gareth', 'Tim', 'Dawn', 'others', 'seem', 'periphery', 'action', 'NBC', 'version', 'managed', 'make', 'characters', 'other', 'main', 'quartet', 'accessible', 'human', 'Here', 'are', 'crowd', 'blocked', 'out', 'David', 'antics', 'few', 'moments', 'occur', 'when', 'characters', 'do', 'emerge', 'human', 'beings', 'own', 'stories', 'focus', 'things', 'Brent', ""n't"", 'allow', 'much', 'more', 'few', 'choice', 'lines', 'awkward', 'moments.That', 'being', 'said', 'show', 'what', 'satire', 'workplace', 'enviroment', 'company', 'essentially', 'paper', 'little', 'else', 'feel', 'secure', 'not', 'people', 'can', 'measure', 'how', 'productive', 'days', 'are', 'looking', 'output', 'are', 'bored', 'looking', 'things', 'do', 'alleviate', 'workplace', 'showcase', 'antics.This', 'first', 'season', 'British', 'original', 'chock-full', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'will', 'make', 'out', 'loud', 'cringe', 'horror', 'better', 'American', 'version', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'shows', 'work', 'own', 'levels', 'Brit', 'version', 'truly', 'original', 'worth', 'catching']",The Office: The Complete First Series

In the beginning, he is talking about something with serious conviction and then he starts getting politically correct and I just started laughing out loud (literally my gut was twisting).  That's when I knew this is the show.  Unfortunately, I forgot after the Gloden Globe awards. Luckily, I stumbled upon it in my local library and started watching the 1st season.  I usually don't order DVD's online or buy something if I have access to it very often, but after watching just one episode, I went to my computer and ordered both seasons of the series.  This the best thing ever happened to TV.  I can watch this series forever (not watching everyday as a habit but watching it very often) and still find little clues and deeper meaning of the comedy/drama.  If you have witty humor or just want to see what's all the fuss about the Office, I highly recommend you buy both seasons and the upcoming Office Special.  The only show that even comes close to its wit is Arrested Development.So What's about? Well, it is about few peoples life in a small paper company office.  The characters are real and the humor is not like your average sitcom comedy but deep, witty remarks that once you understand you'll be crying from laughing so hard.  Try not to watch it with the idea that 'this show is very intelligent and I need to analyze' but simply watch the seasons once and go back and watch them again and you'll know what you have missed the first time. This is a show that more you watch the better it makes you feel about understanding the show.
