Pessimism as comedy is an art form when done right.A totally different movie. Nice easy pace. Soundtrack is really good as Woody's movies usually have. Only a few laugh out loud moments for me but I had a smile the whole movie. Larry's line as they enter the photo gallery was hilarious. Just plain interesting movie. Really liked this one. Something NEW is almost always worth an extra star. E R Wood was really charming and with a very good supporting cast.I hope Jessica Hecht gets more movies roles, very good presence but just a small part here. IMBD lists more roles coming up for her.

1277007,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B002LMV7QG,Amit Talpade,"[0, 0]","Woody Allen directs his alter ego Larry David in this comedy of hopeless encounters and blind chances. Boris Yelnikoff (Larry David ) is a cynical man who has given up on relationships, in between his liberal ranting and bouts of panics he manages to have a close of circle of friends. One day he meets Evan Rachel Wood a runaway from Mississippi and falls in love with her reluctantly. Life appears to be normal but then her mother arrives from the South and hell ensues. She cannot get over the fact that her daughter has married an older man and becomes fixated on finding someone for her closer to her age. She goes through a change as well, and takes on two lovers. A similar thing happens to her father when he comes looking for the mother and daughter and finds an awakening of sorts.This sort of movie has been done before, but Allen's movies are always well written and have funny dialogue. This also marks the first time he has shot in NYC after shooting in Europe for his past movies. Larry David acts the same way he does in Curb your Enthusiasm, a paranoid bundle of nerves. Evan Rachel Wood is great as the Southern gal. Patricia Clarkson is fun.I enjoyed this movie and a couple of scenes has me laughing out loud so give it three stars. 7/15/10",3,Comedy of blind chances,1279324800,"07 17, 2010",2010,1260,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'alter', 'ego', 'Larry', 'David', 'comedy', 'hopeless', 'encounters', 'blind', 'chances', 'Boris', 'Yelnikoff', 'Larry', 'David', 'cynical', 'man', 'who', 'given', 'up', 'relationships', 'liberal', 'ranting', 'bouts', 'panics', 'have', 'close', 'circle', 'friends', 'One', 'day', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'runaway', 'Mississippi', 'love', 'reluctantly', 'Life', 'be', 'normal', 'then', 'mother', 'South', 'hell', 'ensues', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'fact', 'daughter', 'married', 'older', 'man', 'fixated', 'finding', 'someone', 'closer', 'age', 'change', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'lovers', 'similar', 'thing', 'father', 'when', 'looking', 'mother', 'daughter', 'awakening', 'sorts.This', 'sort', 'movie', 'been', 'done', 'Allen', 'movies', 'are', 'always', 'well', 'written', 'have', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'also', 'first', 'time', 'shot', 'NYC', 'shooting', 'Europe', 'past', 'movies', 'Larry', 'David', 'same', 'way', 'Curb', 'Enthusiasm', 'paranoid', 'bundle', 'nerves', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'great', 'Southern', 'gal', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'fun.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'couple', 'scenes', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'so', 'give', 'three', 'stars', '7/15/10']",N/A

David plays a serial curmudgeon much like his character on his HBO show Curb Your Enthusiasm. Here he's a fourth-wall-breaking, Nobel nominated quantum physicist who has a persistently pessimistic view on almost everything--even love...well, sort of. While Allen's last film (Vicki Cristina Barcelona) gave no easy answers on love and lust, Whatever Works is all about easy, breezy answers--love is random & defies logic, find it and give it wherever/whenever you can no matter how small the increments. In other words: love is whatever works at the time. This sweet sentiment juxtaposed with David's hilarious comments on the idiocy of all those around him overcome the sometimes predictable plot and ho-hum cinematography. The film's ending may seem abrupt to some--it almost felt like an ending to an episode of Seinfeld (which David co-created), but much more positive.

E Jackson,"[2, 2]","Whatever Works starts out like it's going to be a really funny comedy with an old man constantly complaining about the world and its many assortment of problems.  He even acknowledges the camera that's filming the movie and talks to us, the viewers, which is always a weird thing to see.One night he comes home and notices an attractive young southern woman sleeping in a cardboard box outside on the streets, and the woman begs the old man to let her inside because she's starving.  He does, and from here the storyline kicks in.For most of the first half, the humor works really well.  The old man continues to be a stubborn old goat who refuses to change his ways or his beliefs, but that doesn't stop the southern girl from admiring and eventually falling in love with the guy.However about halfway through, the girls mother discovers where her daughter has been living, and this is the exact point where the humor completely disappears and the storyline falls apart.  Apparently the mother likes sleeping around with at least two men at once, and she likes fixing up her daughter with men closer to her age because the mother believes marrying someone who's really old isn't right.  However, this completely changes the atmosphere and more importantly, the *fun* the film had going for it.This means we went from humor to a *really* boring drama with the inclusion of one more character (the mother and, to a lesser extent, the father too but that's not really a problem since the father didn't make an appearance until the end).  The plot just completely collapses.It's a shame because there was so much potential for the bitter old man to continue providing laughs by being ignorant and brutally honest, and it really seemed like the storyline was going somewhere interesting with an amazing conclusion but unfortunately it wasn't meant to be.The final 30 minutes were completely dull.  It was just a big romantic scene.  The southern girl matured and quickly became boring.  Her southern charm and her whacky behavior was tossed aside in order to participate in serious romantic scenes.  The old man, as I mention above, not only stops being angry and bitter at the world, but he actually gets pushed out of the storyline for a good chunk of the final 30 minutes.Overall, the first half is great, the second half not so much.

This was interesting and funny in his film Manhattan (and others) where the male character was witty and fun and had an attractive and interesting circle of friends.  Woody Allen wasn't so very old and decrepit-looking back then, so one (me) can understand why a young intelligent (capable of choice) female would be in love with him despite an age disparity.  Whatever Works, in contrast, comes across as pathetic and even dirty.  Woody Allen's alter-ego is now just a boring, sarcastic old crank who walks  around in the same old shorts (that look like boxer shorts), while the young female runaway teenager is a beautiful dumb blond who is inexplicitly in love with him! Being very young, beautiful and, most important, dumb is maybe an old guy's or pedophile's fantasy, suggesting that the teen can be induced to do anything.  Well, whatever works.I also found the following absurd:  She shows up at his door penniless and in raggedy looking clothes, but the next day and each following day she is wearing another (after another) new-looking, very cute and fashionable outfit.  Yet the old guy is still  walking around in the same old shorts... and telling her (pretending) that he wants her to leave, after apparently buying her all those new clothes!The unappealing male lead character is not Larry David's fault because he is just reading Woody Allen's lines and plays him perfectly.  Larry David's Seinfeld writing is great, so hilarious or wonderful, and so are are most of Woody Allen's films, both the funny and serious ones.Whatever Works, Anything Else, and Deconstructing Harry are the only Woody Allen movies that I dislike;  I value and own a dvd of all his others, even the ones he didn't direct (Play It Again Sam and The Front).",2,Poor Woody Allen,1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,1804,"['still', 'pathetically', 'obsessed', 'very', 'young', 'women', 'was', 'interesting', 'funny', 'film', 'Manhattan', 'others', 'where', 'male', 'character', 'was', 'witty', 'fun', 'had', 'attractive', 'interesting', 'circle', 'friends', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'very', 'old', 'decrepit-looking', 'back', 'then', 'one', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'young', 'intelligent', 'capable', 'choice', 'female', 'would', 'be', 'love', 'age', 'disparity', 'Works', 'contrast', 'pathetic', 'even', 'dirty', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'alter-ego', 'now', 'just', 'boring', 'sarcastic', 'old', 'crank', 'who', 'walks', 'same', 'old', 'shorts', 'look', 'boxer', 'shorts', 'young', 'female', 'runaway', 'teenager', 'beautiful', 'dumb', 'blond', 'who', 'inexplicitly', 'love', 'Being', 'very', 'young', 'beautiful', 'most', 'important', 'dumb', 'maybe', 'old', 'guy', 'pedophile', 'fantasy', 'suggesting', 'teen', 'can', 'be', 'induced', 'do', 'anything', 'Well', 'works.I', 'also', 'found', 'following', 'absurd', 'up', 'door', 'penniless', 'raggedy', 'looking', 'clothes', 'next', 'day', 'following', 'day', 'wearing', 'new-looking', 'very', 'cute', 'fashionable', 'outfit', 'old', 'guy', 'still', 'walking', 'around', 'same', 'old', 'shorts', 'telling', 'pretending', 'leave', 'apparently', 'buying', 'new', 'clothes', 'unappealing', 'male', 'lead', 'character', 'not', 'Larry', 'David', 'fault', 'just', 'reading', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'lines', 'perfectly', 'Larry', 'David', 'Seinfeld', 'writing', 'great', 'so', 'hilarious', 'wonderful', 'so', 'are', 'are', 'most', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'funny', 'serious', 'ones.Whatever', 'Works', 'Anything', 'Else', 'Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'are', 'only', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'dislike', 'value', 'own', 'dvd', 'others', 'even', 'ones', 'did', ""n't"", 'direct', 'Play', 'Again', 'Sam', 'Front']",N/A

It's sort of a throw-back to his earlier 'funny' movies of the 1970's = which I guess is not such a coincidence - since I have read that this screenplay was originally written for the hilariously Larger-than-Life: Zero Mostel - I would guess that Woody originally wrote this around 1976, after working with Mostel on another great (funny & serious) film called 'the Front' (directed by Martin Ritt.)In any event, I can definitely see Zero Mostel devour this role, with his voraciously biting Wit & Sarcasm!!But in some ways, I think Larry David might be even better suited to play the one-and-only professor Boris Yellnikoff - because David, being every bit as eager to exercise those sarcastic jabs, upper-cuts and full knock-out Blows ==>At the same time is also authentically believable as the cranial-proud, erudite 'cerebral' physicist (who almost won the Nobel Prize, in the welter-weight division = a Nobel prize-fighter, of course!)It's not for everyone's taste of course, like most Allen films - and if you highly admire the 'serious' introspective award winning W. Allen works - then I recommend the incredibly intense 'Blue Jasmine' instead (how can you possibly miss the greatly inspired performances of Cate Blanchett, Sally Hawkins, and Andrew Dice Clay, no kidding!)But if you are nostalgic (like those extra-terrestrials from 'Stardust Memories') for some good old-fashioned full-throttle Wit & Sarcasm => then you came to the right Planet!!!

I can't think of any other director - with the exception, maybe, of Spielberg - that can still do ""his"" movies, even if they don't continuously make money. Indeed, with Allen you never know -- he can equally have a hit or a miss, but he still gets financing for his ideas. His latest, ""Whatever Works,"" I am happy to say, is a hit. Actually more than a hit: a treasure. One the best films I have seen in a long time. It is smart and wicked, with great dialogue and very funny --Woody Allen's funny, that is, if you know what I mean: just plain good acting and inspired writing.Boris Yellnikoff (Larry David) describes himself as a ""profound, sensitive soul, with an enormous grasp of the human condition,"" who always has nightmares about Joseph Conrad's ""the horror."" He is a brilliant man, who doesn't hesitate to refer to himself as a genius - he is a physicist, who specializes in Quantum mechanics. And he may be right. However, due to the nature of his character and personality, he is not easy to live with. He is divorced, and walks with a limb, because he tried to kill himself by jumping from a window. He earns a living by teaching kids how to play chess (insulting and degrading them), and getting together with his equally intellectual buddies, who patiently hear his rants about the decline of mankind. He claims that he spends his time ""trying to express to cretins that, while a black man got into the White House, he still can't get a cab in New York."" However, his structured life drastically changes when he meets Melodie (Evan Rachel Wood), a runaway that asked for his help at his doorstep, because she had nowhere to go. He reluctantly accepts, and invites her to stay for a couple of days. Of course, love blossoms, and despite their age and intellectual difference - he is much older and smarter than her -, they eventually get married. They actually live happily ever after - that is, until Marietta (Patricia Clarkson), Melodie's mother, suddenly comes into the picture.""Whatever Works"" functions at every level. It is original and hilarious, with Woody Allen providing evidence that he is still the best smart comedy writer that there is. It would not be a mistake to say that it probably captures Woody's inner feelings and current state of mind, which are summed up in one of the lines of the film: ""In the end, the romantic aspirations of your youth are reduced to whatever works."" In addition, it is also a subliminal critique to the right-wing mentality that permeates part of our culture. A comedy masterpiece.

Maybe I saw this film with too many expectations.  Generally I think both men register A work fairly consistently.  However, my experience watching this was that the jokes were all falling flat.  I don't know whether the timing was off or the delivery was off or maybe the jokes weren't even funny.  This film should have worked on me but it didn't.  It seemed forced and contrived plus the point about luck being a dominant force in our lives was hammered home again, and again and again (if we didn't manage to get it in MATCHPOINT).Larry David is a Woody Allen like character who is a strange hybrid of Woody Allen mixed with Larry David.  These are two very strong comic personalities and marrying them to one another may not have been a great idea.  I applaud Woody Allen for climbing down off the screen but coming up with Larry David as his substitute may require some more thinking on his part.Larry David plays an older, mostly washed up character who has strong, negative views on everything, freely shared.  One night, a young woman from Mississippi needs somewhere to stay and she is completely overwhelmed by New York.  Reluctantly, David puts her up.  She won't go away no matter how insulting to her he is. Her mother is Patricia Clarkson, who eventually also puts in an appearance in New York. Then her father, Ed Begley, Jr, appears as well.  Each of them makes rapid fire adjustments to becoming a New Yorker.  They are on the cusp of being amusing during most of the movie but I just never quite buy them as real people.I generally view Woody Allen movies at least twice so I am going to wait a month or two and watch it again.  I just can't believe that I didn't utterly love a Woody Allen movie starring Larry David.  I would still watch it and make up your own mind as comedy is a very individual thing.

But, lesser art that still has moments of greatness, opens up the art to be accessed and then studied and possibly replicated. Such was rarely as obviously displayed as in Woody Allen's latest film, the comedy Whatever Works. I have seen every Woody Allen film, save the film just prior to this, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, and- unless that film defies all expectations set by Allen's post-Golden Age films (1993-present; the Golden Age was 1977-1992)- I can confidently say that the film world will never see another Woody Allen masterpiece along the lines of Hannah And Her Sisters, Stardust Memories, Radio Days, Crimes And Misdemeanors, nor Another Woman. It is simply beyond Allen now. But, in many of these lesser films of the last decade and a half, one can see Allen so thoroughly cribbing from earlier, greater works that it is tempting to rebuke him for it. Whatever Works has stylistic, narrative, and rhythmic larcenies from almost every major Allen film from Annie Hall to Husbands And Wives, and almost none of the thefts are the equal of the original. Yet, by seeing how these scenes, exchanges, and relationships fail, one can only greater appreciate the earlier, vintage Allen all the more. But, the biggest thing missing from the films of recent vintage is the stellar camera work that defined Allen's Golden Age, mostly with cinematographic masters like Gordon Willis and Sven Nykvist. Most of these post-Golden Age films are merely pedestrian visual works with lesser scripts.As it is, Whatever Works will be seen as one of Allen's better post-Golden Age comedies, but, as always, one is left with the disappointment that this was not a Broadway Danny Rose, nor even a The Purple Rose Of Cairo. In fact, Boris ends the film much as Mia Farrow's character in Purple Rose does, finally seeing the Big Picture (a hard thing for particle physicists), save that his has a happy ending (see Hannah And Her Sisters) whereas hers was realistic. What lessons can be inferred from that may hold the clue to why Allen will never achieve filmic greatness again. Regardless, the post-Golden Age Allen has rarely been funnier, and Allen's late stage films surely best those of Federico Fellini and Ingmar Bergman- the two giants of cinema he's most stolen from, even when he's actually improved on their works (see 8 and Amarcord vs. Stardust Memories and Radio Days, or Wild Strawberries vs. Another Woman).

""So-Woody Allen has written and directed yet another fantasy about a neurotic, misanthropic middle-aged Jewish intellectual Manhattanite who meets a young, hot, wide-eyed Shiksa who is irresistibly (and inexplicably) attracted to him? Enough, already!"" So he has written and directed another fantasy about a neurotic, misanthropic middle-aged Jewish intellectual Manhattanite who meets a young, hot, wide-eyed Shiksa who is irresistibly (and inexplicably) attracted to him, OK? And it's smart, insightful and funny. You got a problem with that?Allen may have found his most perfect avatar yet in ""Seinfeld"" co-creator/""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" star (and fellow native Brooklynite) Larry David, who I think proves here that, contrary to what many may assume, he really can act. In his HBO series, David plays ""himself"" as a self-absorbed character whose latent hostility is primarily channeled via classic passive-aggressive behavior. As Allen's protagonist Boris Yellnikoff, there is nothing latent at all about the hostility. He openly hates everybody, including himself. A textbook fatalist, Boris never passes up an opportunity to unceremoniously kick any tiny hint of enthusiasm to the curb and remind anyone in his proximity that it is all for naught.A ""retired"" quantum mechanics physicist (now that's funny right there), Boris has chosen to live in a dumpy apartment (because, you know, why bother?) and make a few shekels here and there giving chess lessons to ""cretinous"" children, whom he browbeats and berates like a Parris Island drill instructor. His social skills with adults aren't so hot, either; still, he manages to find several New York intellectual/Bohemian friends to pal around with; one suspects it's because they are the only people who can bemusedly tolerate his bristly diatribes about the cruel and unfeeling universe for any length of time.When it comes to love and romance, Boris subscribes to accepting whatever Fate and Chance throws your way with a shrug; ""Whatever works,"" as he is fond of telling his friends. That credo is put to the test when Fate and Chance drops a young homeless woman with the unlikely moniker of Melodie St. Ann Celestine (Evan Rachel Wood) onto his doorstep (literally). Melodie is a southern bumpkin who has run away to the Big City to escape her overbearing fundamentalist Christian mother (Patricia Clarkson) and good ol' boy father (Ed Begley, Jr.). Boris reluctantly offers her his couch for a night, and I think you can guess what comes next. After this setup, Allen kicks the story into his patented Urban Fable mode, adding flourishes of ""Pygmalion"" and ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"".It's very theatrical, flirting at times with door-slamming farce, but Woody Classic, all the way. The cast is game, especially the always wonderful Clarkson and Begley, who both chew major scenery as their stereotypical Southern countenance undergoes an unlikely (but inherently entertaining) transformation once each gets a taste of the Big Apple. Allen also tosses a barb or two at the N.Y.C. art scene (reminiscent of John Waters' ""Pecker"").Admittedly, this is the cinematic equivalent of a 12"" remix of Woody's Greatest Hits, but it's got a great beat, and you can dance to it. Let's face it, Allen is not getting any younger, and if he occasionally relents his cranky contrarian tendencies and gives his most ardent fans what they want (i.e., something resembling his early, funny films), is that a bad thing? He's given us 40 years of great laughs; and though I know in my heart of hearts that his best work is history, I'll keep looking forward to his movies.

1277019,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002LMV7QG,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","There is a definite sense of retread to Woody Allen's 2009 farce, a relatively lightweight effort which represents his return to New York City after four films set in Europe, the last being the well-receivedVicky Cristina Barcelona. It's no wonder since the script had been collecting dust in his desk for well over thirty years and was only resuscitated because of the potential threat of a Screen Actors Guild strike. Despite some reference to current events like Darfur, the verbose, intermittently funny script feels like late-seventies Woody with the protagonist talking to the camera the way Alvy Singer did inAnnie Halland a blossoming May-December relationship like the one inManhattan. This time, Allen hands the central role to the even more acerbic Larry David (Curb Your Enthusiasm) as retired nuclear physicist Boris Yellnikoff who decided to jump out of a window and divorce his wealthy wife. He now pontificates ad nauseam with his intellectual friends, browbeats kids while teaching them chess, and lives alone in a tired-looking walk-up in Chinatown - all because he knows he's going to die...eventually.Enter fresh-faced Melodie St. Anne Celestine, a 21-year-old former beauty pageant contestant from Mississippi, who begs Boris for a meal and a place to stay. The model of rural naivet&eacute;, she wins the heart of the sixtyish curmudgeon, and susceptible to his self-proclaimed brilliance, she falls for him and proposes marriage. Against all odds, the relationship seems to work (an intriguingly prophetic view of Allen's later marriage to Soon-Yi Previn), that is, until Melodie's church-going, flamboyantly genteel mother Marietta arrives to reclaim her daughter. Appalled at the apparent absurdity of the marriage, Marietta schemes to have handsome actor Randy James steal Melodie away from Boris. Melodie is attracted but remains faithful to Boris at least for a while. Meanwhile, Marietta begins to love New York and quickly evolves into a bohemian artist in a m&eacute;nage-a-trois arrangement. Her philandering husband, Melodie's father John arrives to reclaim Marietta, but he discovers that he may have untapped feelings that further complicate matters.The resulting roundelay feels a bit like a lighter version ofHannah and Her Sisterswith the plot threads a little too neatly wrapped. David is not really an empathetic figure as Boris, which works for most of the story but not when he needs to show a modicum of vulnerability to balance his character. As Melodie, the versatile Evan Rachel Wood (The Wrestler) - sporting a deep-fried accent - has never been so openly winning before, even though Allen teeters her character's naivet&eacute; into overt caricature at times. Much better used here than inVicky Cristina Barcelona, Patricia Clarkson is hilariously manipulative and adventurous as Marietta, while Ed Begley Jr. does what he can with the smallish role of John toward the end. As Randy, Henry Cavill (The Tudors) fulfills the dashing good looks and dapper manner that make it easy to understand Melodie's temptation. As is usual with Allen's films, the 2009 DVD offers no extras except the original theatrical trailer.

He goes through the motions like a kid who learned his lines for a high school play (as opposed to just being himself on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm""). I mean, I totally get that his character Boris is channeling Woody Allen, but he does a lousy job of it. And anyway, who wants to endure yet more of the accoutrements of neurosis like panic attacks, morbid fear of death, etc.?On the other hand; enter Patricia Clarkson, who does a pretty good job of channeling Blanche DuBois. Make no mistake, there IS some appreciable humor in ""Whatever Works""; it's just that one has to overlook and/or forgive its flaws to enjoy it. Among other things, we are served heaping helpings of Woody Allen's considerable prejudice against women, Southerners, religious zealots, and any combination of the above therein. How can he be so glib? After all, how much time has a dyed-in-the-wool New Yorker like Allen even spent in the South anyway?Fortunately however, Allen has the good sense not to rub our noses in that which might make us squeamish indeed. To wit, the May-December romance mentioned by other Amazon reviewers is thankfully not played out onscreen.

It introduces two  characters, divorced couple,  conservative Christian Southerns from Mississippi who  came to New York in search of their runaway daughter and found out something about themselves and whatever worked for them to turn their lives around, to deal with their issues, and in the end to make Allen's little comedy a really feel good movie. Patricia Clarkson whom I like in every role I've seen her gave another wonderful performance as Marietta. John (Ed Begley, Jr.), Marietta's estranged husband, provided some funniest moments in the film.  As good as Clarkson and Begley are, they play the second fiddle to Larry David's misanthropic, eccentric, sarcastic, neurotic, and by his own words unlikable genius Boris Elnikov who against his best judgment enters impossible romance with a 21 years old naive sweet southern runaway belle named Melody St. Anne Celestine (Evan Rachel Wood). At times, it was creepy - how well David played Allen-like character yet never lost his own personality. I believe that Woody Allen is the best actor to play himself in the movies he directs but Larry David came very close. David's delivery of some lines is hilarious and made me laugh out loud with delight. I have to admit that the first half of the film is a bit over-talkative, static, and with the constant breaking the forth and involving the audiences by direct talking to them, it feels more like a stage play than a movie. Well, I like the movie anyway, and whatever Woody does - works for me. But I am his long time fan and I love his movies even before I see them. I truly believe that even minor Woody is worth watching and  Whatever Works is not an exception. If anything, the movie gives unique chance to see work of two of the very best masters of laughs we have working together. It is not the first movie Allen and David work together in.  David played the small roles in New York Stories (1989) and Radio Days (1987) but after seeing Whatever Works, I'd add that Woody plus Larry ""...is match made in heaven... by a retarded angel."" Whatever works may not belong to the best Allen's pictures, and it is not in the same league as the last year's Vicky Christina Barcelona but it is much better than an average Hollywood comedy that has been released during this year.Mr. Allen, now I am ready to meet a Tall Dark Stanger in London sometime next year, hopefully sooner than later.",4,"Woody plus Larry ""...is match made in heaven... by a retarded angel."" :)",1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,2838,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'return', 'new', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Allen-style', 'dedicated', 'favorite', 'place', 'earth', 'ability', 'change', 'drastically', 'lives', 'who', 'come', 'Big', 'Apple', 'attracted', 'lamp', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'tired', 'poor', 'yearning', 'breathe', 'free', 'movie', 'short', 'just', '90', 'minutes', 'second', 'half', 'fast', 'entertaining', 'very', 'funny', 'two', 'characters', 'divorced', 'couple', 'conservative', 'Christian', 'Southerns', 'Mississippi', 'who', 'came', 'New', 'York', 'search', 'runaway', 'daughter', 'found', 'out', 'something', 'worked', 'turn', 'lives', 'around', 'deal', 'issues', 'end', 'make', 'Allen', 'little', 'comedy', 'really', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'whom', 'like', 'role', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'gave', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Marietta', 'John', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'Marietta', 'estranged', 'husband', 'provided', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film', 'As', 'good', 'Clarkson', 'Begley', 'are', 'play', 'second', 'fiddle', 'Larry', 'David', 'misanthropic', 'eccentric', 'sarcastic', 'neurotic', 'own', 'words', 'unlikable', 'genius', 'Boris', 'Elnikov', 'who', 'best', 'judgment', 'enters', 'impossible', 'romance', '21', 'years', 'old', 'naive', 'sweet', 'southern', 'runaway', 'belle', 'named', 'Melody', 'St.', 'Anne', 'Celestine', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'times', 'was', 'creepy', 'how', 'well', 'David', 'played', 'Allen-like', 'character', 'yet', 'never', 'lost', 'own', 'personality', 'believe', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'best', 'actor', 'play', 'movies', 'Larry', 'David', 'came', 'very', 'close', 'David', 'delivery', 'lines', 'hilarious', 'made', 'out', 'loud', 'delight', 'have', 'admit', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'bit', 'over-talkative', 'static', 'constant', 'breaking', 'forth', 'involving', 'audiences', 'direct', 'talking', 'more', 'stage', 'play', 'movie', 'Well', 'like', 'movie', 'anyway', 'Woody', 'works', 'am', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'love', 'movies', 'even', 'see', 'truly', 'believe', 'even', 'minor', 'Woody', 'worth', 'watching', 'Whatever', 'Works', 'not', 'exception', 'anything', 'movie', 'unique', 'chance', 'see', 'work', 'two', 'very', 'best', 'masters', 'laughs', 'have', 'working', 'together', 'not', 'first', 'movie', 'Allen', 'David', 'work', 'together', 'David', 'played', 'small', 'roles', 'New', 'York', 'Stories', '1989', 'Radio', 'Days', '1987', 'seeing', 'Works', ""'d"", 'add', 'Woody', 'Larry', 'match', 'made', 'heaven', 'retarded', 'angel', 'works', 'may', 'not', 'belong', 'best', 'Allen', 'pictures', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'last', 'year', 'Vicky', 'Christina', 'Barcelona', 'much', 'better', 'average', 'Hollywood', 'comedy', 'been', 'released', 'year.Mr', 'Allen', 'now', 'am', 'ready', 'meet', 'Tall', 'Dark', 'Stanger', 'London', 'sometime', 'next', 'year', 'hopefully', 'sooner', 'later']",N/A

(Note that I'm mixing my cultural idioms here, just as the film mixes Manhattan and Mississippi, or ""Bullets Over Broadway"" with ""Winter's Bone"")  ""Whatever Works"" is possibly Woody's truest-to-self  since ""Sleeper"", but the film character Boris Yellnikoff isn't simply a Woody talk-alike. For one thing, he doesn't whine enough. For another, whatever you think, Boris is a nicer guy than Woody, a more empathetic cynic. Sure, he's a no-limits in-your-face cheap-shot put-down artist -- a New Yorker in short -- but he's also a soft touch. People who hate this film, of whom there are many, denounce Woody for imposing his own persona on the actor Larry David, who should have been allowed to write his own jokes. But those people are all 'fans' of Larry David, from some TV show I imagine, and I have the good luck never to have seen or heard of David before. Yes, there are moments in the film where Larry David captures Woody's affect perfectly, but he's 100% Boris Yelnikoff from start to finish. Hey, I know a guy like that! Some of my best friends are wise-whatevers.Others who hate this film declare that they are offended by its derogatory stereotypes of Southerners and Christians. Yeah, so? Got something against reality? The transformation of the detestable Celestine mother and father into hip urbanites, effected merely by exposure to New York, is short of plausibility, no doubt. Yeah, so? ""Stadtluft macht frei!"" Got something against comedy? Besides, Melody Celestine, the sweet young runaway played by Evan Rachel Wood, remains faultlessly in type. The ensemble acting in this film is far tighter, in my estimation, than in either ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" or ""Midnight in Paris"", Woody's more box-office successful recent films. In fact, I'd say the acting in this film is hecka good...... and it's hecka funny. Even my wife, who adamantly denies Woody any absolution for his marriage to Soon-Yi Previn, guffawed at some of the humor. [Contrary to popular opinion, by the way, Soon-Yi Previn was NOT Woody Allen's adopted daughter and did not grow up in his paternal care. Not that it's any of my business ...] It's a comedy of contrasts and of clashes between insecurities. Boris, the old grump who blabs constantly about his genius, is every bit as insecure as the bubbly Melody. He's a failed genius, and he knows it. She's a failed beauty queen and knows it. Back to those who hate this film, who deride the idea that a naive but gorgeous young woman could swoon over a bald mentor with a limp ... Got news for you, folks! Ask any college professor, orchestra conductor, or pastor of a mega-church whether this infatuation is plausible.And yes, it is a 'feel good' movie, a little on the preachy side. Yeah, so? Got something against happiness?

1277028,AEGLLY9CXWXX3,B002LMV7QG,"Halifax Student Account ""a-beautiful-idea""","[3, 5]","The pseudo-nihilistic ideas in this film sounded like the scribblings of a succesfull rich guy with way too much flab in his brain; trying to be an existential philosopher, with his philonthropic supporters and his barb wire fence.I mean, the guy has been surounding himself with 'yes men' for decades. The all to real philosophical horror knows no yes men!O, Woody Allen and Larry David! Why?You are a wretched and ephemeral pair! Not men, but drones of chance and misery! You force all right thinking people, like you and I, to roll our eyes and to tell you what is best not to hear. The best is utterly beyond your reach: not to be born, not to exist, to be nothing. But the second best is this; to die soon! ....Alas, the advice hasn't been heeded and so this is the product of their brains.  If we leave our IQ at the door, then this is a very funny movie and Larry David is great as ever and so we enjoyed it; my girlfriend and I. However, my girlfriend reckons that Woody Allen isn't as smart as he thinks he is and I mostly agree with her. Let me attempt to explain our reservations (for all you fan-boys wishing to defend rich beyond your dreams Woody Allen, remember that he doesn't care about you, so go support another team), now for our diatribe.This film is an attempt to show off Woody Allen's capabilities as a brain-box and his existential thoughts; he being the Woody Allen we used to love. In the movie, Larry David is brilliant as Boris Yellnikoff, a Nobel level thinker with an IQ of 200 (if you enjoy Curb, you will like this). Boris' massive IQ has stripped the veil of idiocy from his eyes and he can now see the rock-hard reality of the wretched state genius' are always moaning about. Boris therefore sounds angry and opinionated, but that is only because we are hearing him wrong, and he will now share his insights with the dumb viewers (there are some imaginaitve and very funny straight to the camera talking scenes which I found smart).So what profundities does the string theorist have to throw at the cinema audience? Sadly, not much. The words escaping the mouth of the genius are not the thoughts of a man with a massive IQ, but the thoughts of Woody Allen's 2lb of brains. In other words, any baboon, or first year philosophy student, can write this stuff!But you may be wondering, how do I know what a 200 IQ would sound like? Well, many genius scientists and philosophers have written their anger down for posterity and I'm a fan of 'nihilist' ideas; having read the masters like Arthur Schopenhauer (Einstein's and Erwin Schrodinger's favorite philosopher), Tolstoy, especially his very depressing Confessions (Tolstoy became intellectually unglued after reading Schopenhauer and committed suicide) and the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (with the depressed robot. The robot was a brilliant satire on all things gloomy), all have something to important say. So I know horror fairly well and I was hoping to be entertained by this Woody Allen movie. My reason for having high hopes is the fact that, even though Woody Allen's been slowly drudging along for years now, it's rumored that he's a very intelligent guy. Woody Allen knew Marshall McLuhan, youthful Woody Allen made very funny existentialist standup Jew jokes, and he once made a reference to Ernest Becker's Denial of Death in one of his movies and he's even read Friedrich Nietzsche (inspired him to invade Poland apparently).Maybe, just maybe then, the young Allen was a tortured genius inside, but for fear of being shunned by the herd industry, he kept most of his thoughts hidden until the day when he has nothing to lose (he's near death himself, so the time is now).Now that time has arrived and so Allen will give us the fruits of his brains. How about this scenario? Woody Alan is an existentialist intellectual who sees no escape from the fleeting meat-hook of our rubbish existence and after producing rubbish for a few decades himself, in order to earn the trust of human kind you see, old age Allen is at last going to let rip with his own brand of nihilist truth. Why not? If Schrodinger, or Tolstoy and the others did in their later life, then what's Woody Allen got to lose? (by the way, I'm not laughing as Allen's age, because Allen has read Denial of Death, and if he understood it, he should be immune from rampant narcissism in old age)Allen is a millionaire establishment figure after all, and so he's license to let rip, like my hero Ricky Gervais brilliantly let's rip in his work and Larry David brilliantly did in Curb Your Enthusiasm (Larry David is miles funnier than Woody Allen, but not the Allen from the 1970's)). Gervais and David however do not have genius IQ's, so what Boris Yellnikoff has in store for us should be profound..Albert Einstein once said that genius' is an escape from everyday life, with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness. Can Boris Yellnikoff, with his IQ of 200, do any better? Well for a man with an IQ of 200, his sophomore moaning about the universe being indifferent to our whims, and people being mere atoms, screaming through the hollow glass void of emptiness blah blah blah has been done a million times before by first year philosophy students. If you ever watched The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, there is a depressed robot who does the Boris act to a T. Douglas Adams meant his robot as a satire, so after Douglas Adams' robot, any would be smart arse with pretensions to clever pessimism has to do better than the robot. Woody Allen failed. I'm a fan of Larry David, and he's probably an intelligent guy too, but he and Allen are both establishment starts, that is, the establishment is the machine they exist for, and so they are not going to rock the boat with truth. You don't make it to a ripe old age in Hollywood by being an Outsider. Here is an example of Allen's conservative head. Half way through the movie, Larry David's character is near the Statue of Liberty, with the young girl, and he lets rip with a politically correct 'culture wars' left wing rant about white Americans being racist and all that. However, at the start of the movie, David makes clear his detatched resignation from life and his distain for the lumpen herd. A genius would be above the street scuffle of culture war academia anyway, especialy party political careerist behaviour. There are many contradictions like this in Boris's dialogue. For example, the best he can say to the idiot girl is, 'your an idiot'! An idiot girl is not a good interlucotor for a genius to shine on anyway. The reason for this infintile lack of insight is because Woody Allen typed the words, not a genius and so Boris the string theorist ends up sounding like a puppet. Allen should have plagiarized the genius' of history. He should have stole the best bits from Schopenhauer or Sophocles or even Nietzsche, and he could do with some Buddha jokes.

Somehow Allen made if I may a true depiction of previous films such as Annie Hall, Manhattan, Interiors, Mighty Aphrodite or Celebrity.Of course, the Pigmalyon syndrome walks along this funny movie, filled of intense cynicism, bitter points of views and acidic vision about a decaying world in which everybody is uncapable to find the center of their respective lives.Boris is plenty of witty answers but lives a sad existence, hovered by nostalgic gazes; evan rachel Wood is looking for something and ssomeone who really gives her messy life a turning point, Patriacia Clarkson, the devoted mother and the religious father have not lived, just have assumed a fake identity during four decades, as well as his intimate friends, who simply live but don't exist.The main character, Boris has been close to taste the glory and success, but nothing has really happened and has decided to translate this frustration toward the outer world.there are few laughable situations because at the end, Woody propses us a crude reflection about him and about us, our insatisfactions, these little and unsaid pleasures and dissapointments, remarking us over and over about the fugacity of the transient love.Beneath these cruel comments, there's a wise man who feels himself out of this crowdy world, he adores Fred Astaire and dreams about his youthful years.Esentially remarkable is the fact to have chosen the wax museum as the first touristic place. A sinsiter metaphor about the world he stares, cold and dead.Somehow Allen made the full rounded circle with this dramatic comedy in which everybody share this meaningless tradition of the happy new year but at the end, is just a way to avoid to recognize we are close to the end.Maybe this film let you thinking, beneath the laughs with a bitter taste.",4,"Woody Allen : Forty years, forty films!",1308268800,"06 17, 2011",2011,1902,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'director', 'cinema', 'who', 'displayed', 'such', 'stubborness', 'film', 'year', 'year', 'Somehow', 'Allen', 'made', 'may', 'true', 'depiction', 'previous', 'films', 'such', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Manhattan', 'Interiors', 'Mighty', 'Aphrodite', 'Celebrity.Of', 'course', 'Pigmalyon', 'syndrome', 'walks', 'funny', 'movie', 'filled', 'intense', 'cynicism', 'bitter', 'points', 'views', 'acidic', 'vision', 'decaying', 'world', 'everybody', 'uncapable', 'find', 'center', 'respective', 'lives.Boris', 'plenty', 'witty', 'answers', 'sad', 'existence', 'hovered', 'nostalgic', 'gazes', 'rachel', 'Wood', 'looking', 'something', 'ssomeone', 'who', 'really', 'messy', 'life', 'turning', 'point', 'Patriacia', 'Clarkson', 'devoted', 'mother', 'religious', 'father', 'have', 'not', 'lived', 'just', 'have', 'assumed', 'fake', 'identity', 'four', 'decades', 'as', 'well', 'intimate', 'friends', 'who', 'simply', 'live', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist.The', 'main', 'character', 'Boris', 'been', 'close', 'taste', 'glory', 'success', 'nothing', 'really', 'happened', 'decided', 'translate', 'frustration', 'outer', 'are', 'few', 'laughable', 'situations', 'end', 'Woody', 'crude', 'reflection', 'insatisfactions', 'little', 'unsaid', 'pleasures', 'dissapointments', 'remarking', 'fugacity', 'transient', 'love.Beneath', 'cruel', 'comments', 'wise', 'man', 'who', 'crowdy', 'world', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'dreams', 'youthful', 'years.Esentially', 'remarkable', 'fact', 'have', 'chosen', 'wax', 'museum', 'first', 'touristic', 'place', 'sinsiter', 'metaphor', 'world', 'cold', 'dead.Somehow', 'Allen', 'made', 'full', 'rounded', 'circle', 'dramatic', 'comedy', 'everybody', 'share', 'meaningless', 'tradition', 'happy', 'new', 'year', 'end', 'just', 'way', 'avoid', 'recognize', 'are', 'close', 'end.Maybe', 'film', 'let', 'thinking', 'laughs', 'bitter', 'taste']",N/A

Alvi,"[17, 25]","I've enjoyed Woody Allen's movies in the past, and I've also enjoyed Larry David in ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" but I quickly took a disliking to this movie and my impression hadn't improved by the end.  For me, there's simply nothing good about the movie.The plot is silly without being funny, the characters are flat and unbelievable, and Larry David's acting is weak.  Sorry, attractive and kind-hearted young women don't go for nihilistic and caustically rude old men with no money and delusions of grandeur.  And string theorists don't behave like the Boris character, their field isn't quantum mechanics (it's quantum gravity, which is a very different animal), and they don't have priveleged access to the ""big picture"" (string theory hasn't yet even been worked out theoretically, much less empirically corroborated).More importantly, on a thematic level, all we really get is a shallow and caricatured version of existentialism, perhaps closer to Epicureanism.  This notion that ""life is obviously meaningless, so grab and give what little pleasures you can along the way"" reflects a dogmatic, unimaginative, and pitifully hedonistic mind which has failed to grow and has apparently stopped searching.  The only redeeming insight is that luck may play a larger role in our lives than most of us realize.Summing up, I can't recommend this movie because it's neither deep nor entertaining.

1277035,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B002LMV7QG,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[1, 2]","Woody Allen is the mastermind director behind great films like Bullets Over Broadway, Crimes and Misdemeanors, and of course Annie Hall. He has made a name for himself writing quirky romantic comedies that go deeper than a romantic comedy deserves to delve, and creating neurotic characters (typically Jewish) that would probably be better off on a psychiatrist's couch than parading around for our entertainment. Larry David is one of the writers, producers, and creators of Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm, and he stars in the latter. In Curb Your Enthusiasm Larry David plays himself as a neurotic yuppie who talks himself into painfully funny situation. When it comes to the pairing of Woody Allen and Larry David in Whatever Works the question you need to ask yourself isn't, ""Is it any good,"" but rather, ""Why didn't this happen sooner?!""Boris Yellnikoff (Larry David) is a pessimistic, brilliant, old curmudgeon. A former university professor, who almost got nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics, Boris tried to commit suicide, and gave up his old life when he failed. Moving to a poor area of town, Boris gets talked into taking in a young runaway, Melodie St. Ann Celestine (Evan Rachel Wood), but eventually falls in love with her and marries her. Things go fine until her parents, Marietta (Patricia Clarkson) and John (Ed Begley Jr.), finally find their missing daughter.Woody Allen, coming off of Vicky Christina Barcelona, finally creates a comedy more worthy of his older, and generally much funnier material. With Whatever Works he creates situations that are more realistic, with characters that are more real than he's created in a comedy in a while. His dialogue is just as sharp as it ever was, but at the same time, more so than in a lot of his past comedies, not everyone feels like they're talking ""Woody,"" so to speak.The acting is phenomenal, as should be expected of an Allen movie. The difference in here and in any other movie he's directed that he hasn't starred in is that in Larry David he doesn't get an actor that is trying to be a clone of him as he does with Jason Biggs in Anything Else or Will Ferrell in Melinda and Melinda. Evan Rachel Wood (Across the Universe) also stands out as the polar opposite to David's neurotic curmudgeon Boris. And they play very well together, the actor and actress appear to actually have real chemistry in front of the camera which makes you believe that this young girl really wants to be with an old crotchety man like Boris.Naturally, though, there are things that detract from the movie. Some of the relationships don't completely seem to ring true (a relationship between Marietta and her two lovers later on in the movie may strike many viewers as odd), or some people just won't like where certain things fit (how many people complained about the pairing in King of Queens? they won't like Larry David with Evan Rachel Wood). There's also a late homosexual revelation that happens a little too quickly.

It's a lethal combination because David plays a very negative, cynical, pessimistic, nasty piece of work and add to that the neuroses and whining of the Woody Allen persona, and you've got a lot of movie watchers, turned off by the negativity, looking for the Stop button on their DVD controls. David plays an irritating, opinionated loudmouth who can't shut up. People, to him, are not basically decent. There are stretches when he talks directly to the audience, a device often resorted to when a script is in trouble.Boris says, ""The universe is winding down, why shouldn't we?"" David has divorced his wife, is subject to late night panic attacks, and has attempted suicide. He meets a young, attractive homeless girl, Melody, and lets her stay at his place. He says he's a genius, and she's a simple Southern girl who is impressed by his gab though the audience will find it tedious. She wins him over, he falls for her, and they get married.Her mother, estranged from the girl's father, shows up, and, of course, hates this older man that her daughter has married. Soon the mother goes bananas and becomes a free-loving bohemian. Eventually the father shows up and he, too, goes off the deep end.As it goes along, David calms down, and the flick has some funny jokes and situations. It's very much a New York movie in the mold of most of Woody's work. His films are for a limited audience, and this one may be for an even more limited audience than usual. A happy ending is tacked on, but it's a quirky one.Despite its grating, loud beginning, stick with it and it may grow on you.

1277039,ARK323I3EV98D,B002LMV7QG,Jordan D. Wilson,"[1, 1]","t's always so reassuring to see the opening credits of a Woody Allen film. The screen is black, the credits come and go very neatly, a tune playing in the background, and then the movie begins. Whatever Work's begins this way, and as the final credit fades away, so begins the beautiful flow of dialogue that Allen has written for us, to entertain and to persuade us to think and laugh simultaneously. His follow up to Vicky Christina Barcelona, Whatever Works is about... well, the title says it all.Seinfeld co-creator and Curb Your Enthusiasm creator/star Larry David plays Boris Yellnikoff, a nuclear physicist who claims to be a genius who was once almost nominated for a Nobel Prize. Boris is a grouchy old nihilist who, through his infinite knowledge, has decided that nothing in the world is really meaningful or important. He sees himself as surrounded by a bunch of ""inchworms"", and in his inspired opening monologue, he addresses us-the audience-informing us that he is not a likeable guy. He knows this, and does us what I'm sure he sees as a common courtesy.Boris lives in an apartment in Chinatown, and spends his time either lecturing to a table of his companions at a local coffee shop, or reluctantly teaching chess to kids, whom he refers to as imbeciles and morons. One night, as he's walking home, he stumbles upon a young girl named Melody St. Anne Celestine (Evan Rachel Wood) begging for food, and hesitantly allows her into his home. His opinion of her initially fits in with his outlook on the world, but over time he grows fond of her, and she grows fond of him. As their relationship strangely becomes something more than seems logical or even possible, events take a bizarre and unpredictable turn that leads Boris to question his own perspective, bringing him to new revelations and to the philosophy: whatever works!This attitude ends up being shared by nearly every character in the movie, including Melody's beauty-pageant-stage-mom, Marietta (Patricia Clarkson), and her adulterous, God-fearing father, John (Ed Begley Jr.), who both show up out of the clear blue sky, looking for their daughter who ran away from home. They are a southern family, but they may as well be aliens to Boris, and vice versa. Wonderful performances spiral around Larry David's brilliant work as the curmudgeon, Yellnikoff. His delivery of Allen's lines is pitch-perfect, something that I came into this film expecting. The two just seems to naturally click. Wood also does some of her most intriguing work as the nave out-of-town girl who is drawn to Boris' strange ways almost at once.The film could almost be done as a stage play, in that the scenes are fairly static, and involve many long monologues that play nicely against the dialogue that bounces between characters. There are many long streams of dialogue filmed without cutting away, which I like a lot. Allen does this frequently, and it allows the actors to talk and bicker with feeling and authenticity. My only issue with Whatever Works is that it is harmlessly illogical, and by the end, everything is too tidily settled and at ease. I like how Allen plays around with fate and happiness, but there are some bits and pieces in the final third of the movie that don't quite work. Having said that, I think Allen has a pretty decent comedy here, one that may not equal some of his other recent films, but-whatever works!",4,Woody Allen and Larry David Join Forces,1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,3395,"['t', 'always', 'so', 'reassuring', 'see', 'opening', 'credits', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'screen', 'black', 'credits', 'come', 'go', 'very', 'neatly', 'tune', 'playing', 'background', 'then', 'movie', 'Whatever', 'Work', 'begins', 'way', 'final', 'credit', 'fades', 'away', 'so', 'beautiful', 'flow', 'dialogue', 'Allen', 'written', 'entertain', 'persuade', 'think', 'laugh', 'simultaneously', 'follow', 'up', 'Vicky', 'Christina', 'Barcelona', 'Whatever', 'Works', 'well', 'title', 'all.Seinfeld', 'co-creator', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'creator/star', 'Larry', 'David', 'Boris', 'Yellnikoff', 'nuclear', 'physicist', 'who', 'be', 'genius', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'almost', 'nominated', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'Boris', 'grouchy', 'old', 'nihilist', 'who', 'infinite', 'knowledge', 'decided', 'nothing', 'world', 'really', 'meaningful', 'important', 'surrounded', 'bunch', 'inchworms', 'inspired', 'opening', 'monologue', 'us-the', 'audience-informing', 'not', 'likeable', 'guy', 'what', ""'m"", 'sure', 'common', 'courtesy.Boris', 'lives', 'apartment', 'Chinatown', 'time', 'lecturing', 'table', 'companions', 'local', 'coffee', 'shop', 'reluctantly', 'teaching', 'chess', 'kids', 'whom', 'imbeciles', 'morons', 'One', 'night', 'walking', 'home', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Melody', 'St.', 'Anne', 'Celestine', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'begging', 'food', 'hesitantly', 'home', 'opinion', 'initially', 'fits', 'outlook', 'world', 'time', 'fond', 'her', 'fond', 'relationship', 'strangely', 'something', 'more', 'logical', 'even', 'possible', 'events', 'take', 'bizarre', 'unpredictable', 'turn', 'Boris', 'question', 'own', 'perspective', 'bringing', 'new', 'revelations', 'philosophy', 'attitude', 'up', 'being', 'shared', 'nearly', 'character', 'movie', 'including', 'Melody', 'beauty-pageant-stage-mom', 'Marietta', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'adulterous', 'God-fearing', 'father', 'John', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'who', 'show', 'up', 'clear', 'blue', 'sky', 'looking', 'daughter', 'who', 'ran', 'away', 'home', 'are', 'southern', 'family', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'aliens', 'Boris', 'vice', 'versa', 'Wonderful', 'performances', 'spiral', 'Larry', 'David', 'brilliant', 'work', 'curmudgeon', 'Yellnikoff', 'delivery', 'Allen', 'lines', 'pitch-perfect', 'something', 'came', 'film', 'expecting', 'two', 'just', 'naturally', 'click', 'Wood', 'also', 'most', 'intriguing', 'work', 'nave', 'out-of-town', 'girl', 'who', 'drawn', 'Boris', 'strange', 'ways', 'almost', 'once.The', 'film', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'done', 'stage', 'play', 'scenes', 'are', 'fairly', 'static', 'involve', 'many', 'long', 'monologues', 'play', 'nicely', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'are', 'many', 'long', 'streams', 'dialogue', 'filmed', 'cutting', 'away', 'like', 'lot', 'Allen', 'frequently', 'actors', 'talk', 'bicker', 'feeling', 'authenticity', 'only', 'issue', 'Whatever', 'Works', 'harmlessly', 'illogical', 'end', 'everything', 'too', 'tidily', 'settled', 'ease', 'how', 'Allen', 'fate', 'happiness', 'are', 'bits', 'pieces', 'final', 'third', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'Having', 'said', 'think', 'Allen', 'pretty', 'decent', 'comedy', 'here', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'equal', 'other', 'recent', 'films', 'but-whatever', 'works']",N/A

Since Allen releases a new film each year, it's hit-or-miss with him (rightfully so). This film got less-than-enthusiastic reviews and, as such, I wasn't expecting much from it...But the critics really misrepresented this film, as this is one of Woody's best comedies.Larry David (of Curb Your Enthusiasm fame) plays Boris Yellnikoff, a caustic, retired physicist who walks with a limp due to a failed suicide attempt. Now, Boris teaches chess to ""zombie-minded imbeciles."" Evan Rachel Wood plays Melodie, a nave runaway from Mississippi, who stumbles into Boris' life...Against all odds, the two marry and Melodie's parents (played wonderfully by Patricia Clarkson and Ed Begley, Jr.) both, separately, find her.I'm not familiar with Larry David's previous work, so I don't know how much of this performance carries over from his own persona; but David is playing the Woody Allen role here to perfection. David perfectly captures the neurotic, arrogant genius that is Boris and recites Allen's dialogue as if it comes straight from his own thoughts. Of course, this is a film filled with great performances as can be expected from a film by Woody Allen. Begley, Jr. is particularly surprising as Melodie's father...And while some may not be too impressed by Wood's performance as Melodie, she's very convincing and cute.This is truthfully one of Allen's best comedies and an all-around great film. The dialogue here is typical, philosophical, sarcastic Allen...But it doesn't just elicit chuckles, but full-on, laugh-out-loud laughter. It's a very intelligent film that not ONLY ranks as one of Allen's best comedies, but one of his best films. I don't see how this film has not received the amount of praise it deserves, because I clearly saw something all the critic's didn't. While the past few years have shown a return to form for Allen, this film stands as a terrific achievement in the Allen catalogue. It's quite honestly one of the best films I've seen this year and it's not to be missed.GRADE: A",5,"Certainly In the Minority Here, But 'Whatever Works' Works.",1256428800,"10 25, 2009",2009,2124,"['string', 'movies', 'set', 'Europe', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'triumphantly', 'beloved', 'New', 'York', 'Whatever', 'Works', 'Allen', 'new', 'film', 'year', 'hit-or-miss', 'rightfully', 'so', 'film', 'got', 'less-than-enthusiastic', 'reviews', 'such', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'critics', 'really', 'misrepresented', 'film', 'one', 'Woody', 'best', 'comedies.Larry', 'David', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'fame', 'Boris', 'Yellnikoff', 'caustic', 'retired', 'physicist', 'who', 'limp', 'due', 'failed', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'Now', 'Boris', 'chess', 'zombie-minded', 'imbeciles', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Melodie', 'nave', 'runaway', 'Mississippi', 'who', 'Boris', 'life', 'Against', 'odds', 'two', 'marry', 'Melodie', 'parents', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'separately', 'find', 'her.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'Larry', 'David', 'previous', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'performance', 'own', 'persona', 'David', 'playing', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'role', 'here', 'perfection', 'David', 'perfectly', 'neurotic', 'arrogant', 'genius', 'Boris', 'Allen', 'dialogue', 'straight', 'own', 'thoughts', 'course', 'film', 'filled', 'great', 'performances', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'film', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'particularly', 'surprising', 'Melodie', 'father', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'impressed', 'Wood', 'performance', 'Melodie', 'very', 'convincing', 'cute.This', 'truthfully', 'one', 'Allen', 'best', 'comedies', 'all-around', 'great', 'film', 'dialogue', 'here', 'typical', 'philosophical', 'sarcastic', 'Allen', ""n't"", 'just', 'elicit', 'chuckles', 'full-on', 'laugh-out-loud', 'laughter', 'very', 'intelligent', 'film', 'not', 'ONLY', 'one', 'Allen', 'best', 'comedies', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'film', 'not', 'received', 'amount', 'praise', 'clearly', 'saw', 'something', 'critic', 'did', ""n't"", 'past', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'shown', 'return', 'form', 'Allen', 'film', 'terrific', 'achievement', 'Allen', 'catalogue', 'quite', 'honestly', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'not', 'be', 'missed.GRADE']",N/A

Allen is clearly at the end of his career rope here, and the oft-endless tirades and rants, which were much much funnier and more brilliantly concise in earlier masterpieces like AH, Purple Rose, Hannah, and others, are here flat and lifeless and far too long.There's very little of Allen's once-sparkling wit here; instead, as his recent pieces for The New Yorker demonstrate, he's merely imitating himself by this point, and badly. Which is ironic, as David has admitted often that he started out as a Woody copy, and that Seinfeld's Costanza was modeled after a Woody/Larry mix. So when Larry does Woody here, as he clearly is doing, gestures and all, it's a little too Orobouros with not nearly enough genius.No fault of David's though; he's given a preachy, obvious, ham-handed script, and the best Allen impersonation in the world couldn't save it. There are many scenes here where I had to close my eyes and wince at how bad the dialogue is, and how long the boring speeches about how crappy modern life is go on and on. Tell you what, Woody: my modern life is crappier for having listened to your terrible writing in this turkey.The only decent thing here for my money was Ed Begley's performance; he transcends the material where the other actors can't, and occasionally lifts above and becomes interesting. But in the end, that material is too weak and self-serving to ever produce a movie that I would even remotely consider watching again, or even laughing at the first time in any fashion but ironically.What tops this mess is Woody's continuing and ever-more-pathetic lust for young girls. It started in Manhattan, where Mariel Hemingway was 17 to his 40 year-old self, continued in various other movies and on into real life where he was molesting his adopted teenage daughter, and now Woody's 60-something is hooking up with a 19 year-old. Lovely. The biggest joke is how he has his character here pretend to not be interested. Yeah, right, Woodward. You're sick for teen girls. Sick, buddy. We get it by now: you've obsessed over it for 30 years on screen and in real life. It ruined your reputation and career, remember? But still you continue with the teenage girls. What's next, 80-year-old Woody with a 14 year-old?It's funny how few reviewers will touch that very vital point here, but to me it sums up this whole film. It pretends to be world-weary and hyper-mature, but is in fact a long string of misanthropy set up to make the old guy's falling for a teenage girl some sort of epiphany of kindness and joy. Instead it felt to me like an incredibly over-reaching unfunny ""comedy"" that merely continues to stick Allen's obsession with teenage girls in the world's face.And there's nothing very funny about that, after all is said and done.Annie Hall was hilarious because it was fresh, and when it broke the fourth wall and talked to the viewer, it worked. Here that device has become a tired trope, and when Allen's character talks to me, despite David's best efforts, I feel like yelling back to him, ""Give it up! You're a sad old pervert and you're just not very funny any more. You've said everything here over and over for decades. Give it up.""Which bums me out, because I love the best of Woody's films and his early books and stand-up (his 60s comedy is well worth hearing on cd, btw). But Whatever Works is self-parodistic in all the wrong ways, and even Larry's game attempt at making this dialogue fly lands flat on its face.I highly recommend you see Woody's first ten films before even considering this one.And then watch them again and avoid WW altogether, because it's one of his worst.",3,"...and whatever doesn't; I love Woody and Larry, but this blows",1267142400,"02 26, 2010",2010,3759,"['2.7', 'starsAnnie', 'Hall', 'truly', 'classic', 'comedy', 'Works', 'mess', 'one', 'need', 'do', 'watch', 'AH', 'then', 'WW', 'perspective', 'Allen', 'clearly', 'end', 'career', 'rope', 'here', 'oft-endless', 'tirades', 'rants', 'were', 'much', 'much', 'funnier', 'more', 'brilliantly', 'concise', 'earlier', 'masterpieces', 'AH', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Hannah', 'others', 'are', 'here', 'flat', 'lifeless', 'far', 'too', 'long.There', 'very', 'little', 'Allen', 'once-sparkling', 'wit', 'here', 'instead', 'recent', 'pieces', 'New', 'Yorker', 'demonstrate', 'merely', 'imitating', 'point', 'badly', 'Which', 'ironic', 'David', 'admitted', 'often', 'started', 'out', 'Woody', 'copy', 'Seinfeld', 'Costanza', 'was', 'modeled', 'Woody/Larry', 'mix', 'So', 'when', 'Larry', 'Woody', 'here', 'clearly', 'doing', 'gestures', 'little', 'too', 'Orobouros', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'genius.No', 'fault', 'David', 'though', 'given', 'preachy', 'obvious', 'ham-handed', 'script', 'best', 'Allen', 'impersonation', 'world', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'here', 'where', 'had', 'close', 'eyes', 'wince', 'how', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'how', 'long', 'boring', 'speeches', 'how', 'crappy', 'modern', 'life', 'go', 'Tell', 'what', 'Woody', 'modern', 'life', 'crappier', 'having', 'listened', 'terrible', 'writing', 'turkey.The', 'only', 'decent', 'thing', 'here', 'money', 'was', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'performance', 'material', 'where', 'other', 'actors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'occasionally', 'lifts', 'interesting', 'end', 'material', 'too', 'weak', 'self-serving', 'ever', 'produce', 'movie', 'would', 'even', 'remotely', 'consider', 'watching', 'again', 'even', 'laughing', 'first', 'time', 'fashion', 'ironically.What', 'mess', 'Woody', 'continuing', 'ever-more-pathetic', 'lust', 'young', 'girls', 'started', 'Manhattan', 'where', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'was', '17', '40', 'year-old', 'self', 'continued', 'various', 'other', 'movies', 'real', 'life', 'where', 'was', 'molesting', 'adopted', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'now', 'Woody', '60-something', 'hooking', 'up', '19', 'year-old', 'Lovely', 'biggest', 'joke', 'how', 'character', 'here', 'pretend', 'not', 'be', 'interested', 'Yeah', 'right', 'Woodward', ""'re"", 'sick', 'teen', 'girls', 'Sick', 'buddy', 'get', 'now', ""'ve"", 'obsessed', '30', 'years', 'screen', 'real', 'life', 'ruined', 'reputation', 'career', 'remember', 'still', 'continue', 'teenage', 'girls', 'What', 'next', '80-year-old', 'Woody', '14', 'year-old', 'funny', 'how', 'few', 'reviewers', 'will', 'touch', 'very', 'vital', 'point', 'here', 'sums', 'up', 'whole', 'film', 'be', 'world-weary', 'hyper-mature', 'fact', 'long', 'string', 'misanthropy', 'set', 'up', 'make', 'old', 'guy', 'falling', 'teenage', 'girl', 'sort', 'epiphany', 'kindness', 'joy', 'Instead', 'felt', 'incredibly', 'over-reaching', 'unfunny', 'comedy', 'merely', 'stick', 'Allen', 'obsession', 'teenage', 'girls', 'world', 'face.And', 'nothing', 'very', 'funny', 'said', 'done.Annie', 'Hall', 'was', 'hilarious', 'was', 'fresh', 'when', 'broke', 'fourth', 'wall', 'talked', 'viewer', 'worked', 'Here', 'device', 'become', 'tired', 'trope', 'when', 'Allen', 'character', 'talks', 'David', 'best', 'efforts', 'feel', 'yelling', 'back', 'Give', 'up', ""'re"", 'sad', 'old', 'pervert', ""'re"", 'just', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'more', ""'ve"", 'said', 'everything', 'here', 'decades', 'Give', 'up', 'Which', 'bums', 'out', 'love', 'best', 'Woody', 'films', 'early', 'books', 'stand-up', '60s', 'comedy', 'well', 'worth', 'hearing', 'cd', 'btw', 'Whatever', 'Works', 'self-parodistic', 'wrong', 'ways', 'even', 'Larry', 'game', 'attempt', 'making', 'dialogue', 'fly', 'flat', 'face.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'see', 'Woody', 'first', 'ten', 'films', 'even', 'considering', 'one.And', 'then', 'watch', 'again', 'avoid', 'WW', 'altogether', 'one', 'worst']",N/A

As such, it is a paean to the city's power to change ignorant hicks into sophisticated urbanites. It has to be the city, because the Larry David character by himself would drive any self-respecting hick back to Hicksville or wherever they come from.Predictably, David plays the Woody Allen character, a hypochodriac, bitter, offensive boor whose dialogue consists mainly of insults. We learn that he's a brilliant physicist, at one time short-listed for the Nobel Prize, but I've noticed that in most films where a character is repeatedly described as brilliant/brave/badass/wonderful, the more talking about this superlative quality, the less evidence of it there is on screen. Fine, I'll take his word for it - he's a genius. And Allen's studio must have inserted a clause in his contract requiring an elderly man and a pretty girl one-fifth his age to fall in love in every film - Allen should just make a film chronicling his own romance with Soon-Yi Previn and just get it out of his system.The main characters are parodies of themselves, with Evan Rachel Woods as the impossibly good-natured waif who marries him, and Patricia Clarkson and Ed Begley, Jr. as her (initially) ignorant, racist parents. There's a pat ending - and I mean pat - it's one thing to tie up all the loose ends; it's quite another to tie an eight-year-old's shoes so tightly that his eyes bug out. After all that invective, the insults coming from all sides, the endless pontificating on the futility of it all, we learn that only love is real - it's as if Allen has just joined &#34;A Course In Miracles.&#34;A few of Allen's &#34;serious&#34; films, &#34;Hannah and Her Sisters,&#34; &#34;Interiors,&#34; &#34;Crimes and Misdemeanors&#34; are masterpieces of the filmmaker's art. In &#34;Broadway Danny Rose,&#34; the extraterrestrials advise Allen to &#34;make funnier movies.&#34; What they had in mind was &#34;Sleeper,&#34; but many years ago, Allen settled on a tragicomic or bittersweet or dramedy. Despite the repeated breaking of the fourth wall by Larry David, while the other characters remain in the film (&#34;who's he talking to?&#34;), the &#34;deep&#34; philosophizing (nothing more advanced that what you would hear at a junior high school lunch table), there's nothing of the gravity of those other films.

Imagine Larry David pretending to be Woody Allen, interacting with a cast of characters from The Beverly Hillbillies. That's exactly what this film is. I'm completely serious.Allen should be ashamed of this travesty, for many reasons. The dialogue was almost uniformly horrendous, with characters implausibly speaking things that should have been shown, like a Three's Company episode. Even Larry David's trademark crankiness, when infused with Allen's bleak, pseudo-intellectual perspective, grows old very quickly because it is presented repetitively, without wit or subtlety. Almost every single scene was a predictable string of clich&eacute;s that we've seen far too many times already. Several times I knew exactly what was going to happen as soon as the set up was revealed.Beyond that, the film is simply ignorant and mean. Staggeringly so.

Woody had written a terrific role for Larry playing Boris Yelnokov, a genius with a morbid view of life who lets a runaway teen/young adult  (Evan Rachel Wood who we last saw as the Vampire Queen in True Blood) into his life and everything changes.  Woody went back to his roots with this one and Larry is basically playing Woody in Annie Hall with some of the humor that goes back to Take The Money and Run.The girl (Melody) is fascinated with Boris no matter how insulting he is (he constantly insults his young chess students) or how bleak his outlook is.  Boris tells his friend that she is only staying with him for a few days, which turns into a few months, which turns into a year.  Eventually the two get married.  The movie really takes off when Melody's mother (Marrietta) shows up.  She is the stereotypical Southern mom who goes to Church every Sunday and forces her daughter into beauty pageants and baton twirling.  Once Marrietta meets Boris' friends her whole life changes too.No matter how changed Marrietta becomes, she hates Boris and does everything she can to break up her daughter's marriage.  Eventually, Melody's father shows up and he too is a stereotypical Southern male who radically changes after being exposed to Boris' world.As a big fan of early Woody Allen, I loved this film.

Also, his movies always feature some interesting casting and usually some delightful locations and great music.The degree of success of his films these days seems to relate directly to just how tired Allen's ideas are. Recent ""successes"" include MATCH POINT and VICKI CHRISTINA BARCELONA. In both films (and they are very different films too), Allen is exploring things in a fresh, new way for him. (I'm not saying the ideas are new or even new to Allen...just that the method of exploration is different.) For example, in MATCH POINT, Allen looks at the idea of committing murder and the affect of getting away with it on ones conscience. He did this before with CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS...but MATCH POINT took a different approach, assisted by a very serious tone and gorgeous London locations. It felt like Allen the screenwriter was engaged in his work. BARCELONA too.Then you have movies like WHATEVER WORKS. I laughed out loud at MANY moments in the film. There are moments of great wit and sly observation. The casting was exciting...just the idea of Larry David starring in a Woody Allen film was enough to get me to the theatre. Evan Rachel Wood is real up-and-coming actress and Patricia Clarkson is always, ALWAYS worthwhile. And heck, even Ed Begley Jr. and Michael McKean always stir my interest. The NYC locations were vibrant, and I loved Larry David's run-down yet somehow charming apartment. The jazzy music, with a sprinkling of classical, was very nice.Yet the script still felt tired. David plays Boris, a ""genius"" physicist who was ""almost nominated for a Nobel Prize...but it's all politics."" David is a misanthrope of the worst kind...he's very unhappy himself (suicidal, even) yet he's also quite willing to spill his well worded bile on everyone around him. He lives in near seclusion now, earning a meager living by teaching chess to kids. Kids he seems to loathe.One evening, against his better judgment, he lets a young runaway (Wood) come to his apartment for some food. She ends up staying the night, and then another and another. She's from the South and has the accent to prove it. She's uneducated in ways that frustrate David to no end. Yet as she takes up seemingly permanent residence in his home, she is a blank slate eager that David can write on with ease...and as she begins to sound more and more like him, he finds himself (in his misanthropic way) bewitched by her.Their idyll is interrupted with the arrival some months later of Wood's mother, Patricia Clarkson. She's a repressed, bible-thumping right-winger of the extreme, one-dimensional sort that only Allen could come up with. Yet given time in NYC, her views change a bit.I'll stop with my summary there, because the plot does take a few turns...and while none of the twists are in the least bit surprising, I still won't act as spoiler. If you've seen a few Allen films...you pretty much know EXACTLY where the film is going. And that's the problem...Allen is exploring no new ground and he's doing it in a manner that yields no surprises. (Although I will say that my 16-year-old daughter who was attending her FIRST Allen film WAS actually surprised...and she liked the film quite a bit. What do kids know?!?!) Larry David is in the Woody Allen role, and while it fits him better than that mantle fit Kenneth Branaugh (CELEBRITY) or Jason Biggs (ANYTHING ELSE)...we still recognize the same old shtick when we hear it.And what is the ""area of exploration?"" The unpredictability, untidiness and fleeting nature of love. The ""heart wants what the heart wants"" despite what the brain might know better. Gee, Allen has never explored those areas before!!Allen makes things more painful by having David frequently speak directly to the camera. These moments of ""stand up"" may have some amusing moments...but they are extremely jarring and wipe out any absorption we might have been enjoying. In addition, Allen is so jarringly one-dimensional about some things. As I mentioned, his take on Patricia Clarkson's character is ridiculously simplistic. Apparently everyone in the South is mindlessly religious and the height of society is to have a fish-fry. And, of course, everyone is sexually repressed. And, as Allen demonstrated in HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, apparently all ""rock"" music is basically death-metal...loud, pointless and mindless. These are but two examples.The performers are all fine in their frequently one-dimensional roles. Actors always give their best for Allen...even when the effort is mostly fruitless. Star Larry David takes a little getting used to...it isn't really until Wood comes along to soften his rough edges that he feels like a somewhat believable hum being. But frankly, it's more the fault of the script than the actor in this case. I'd still someday like to see Larry David given a truly challenging role, because it seems that hidden somewhere underneath the ""Larry David"" persona is a performer waiting to give a truly textured performance.As far as WHATEVER WORKS, I will simply say ""whatever.""",3,"Some big laughs, but mostly uninspired",1283385600,"09 2, 2010",2010,5114,"['Almost', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'good',

Is he really so one-dimensional, returning time and time again, with diminishing returns, to the themes that have filled too many of his films?  Forget for a moment the older man/younger woman relationships - how about the persistent hatred of popular music, the affairs without any emotional consequences, the Manhattan that resembles no Manhattan I've inhabited in the last 40 years?The problem is that this film, like so many of his films these days, is positively hermetically sealed off from any new experience, any new opinions, any new take on life.

These films make me laugh every time I see them. I particularly like Allen's comments to the audience and often deadpan remarks. Most of his later films left me as boring. So, now you know where I'm coming from.I've watched ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" a few times but I find Larry David's character repetitive. So when I watched this short 92-minute film - Allen's latest (so new it even has an Obama joke) - and David came on the screen, I was not ready for the fund I'd have as the film progressed. Not only did David become less annoying to me (if you love his CYI character, you'll love him here) but the moment actress Evan Rachel Wood appeared, I was smitten. She is soooooooooooo cute in both looks and personality and its really her film more than David's. Casting Patricia Clarkson as her mother was perfect. She even looks like her. All the other characters are minor in the scheme of things. And the movie goes in a direction you will least expect. So don't know too much before you watch it. It'll spoil the fun.If Allen would continue to make little funny films like this (and with great classic recordings for the soundtrack) I'll come running back to watch his movies. I really enjoyed this one.There are ""special features"" except for the trailer.

1277071,A4JHEO7H330AF,B002LMV7QG,Tom Brody,"[9, 13]","WHATEVER WORKS is a drama taking place in a middle-class residential neighborhood in New York City, complete with Jewish delicatessens and art galleries. This type of neighborhood is familiar to me, as I have toured the SoHo district in lower Manhattan many times. Because the story took place in lower Manhattan, the movie was continually fascinating to me. The film takes place in the present day, that is, circa 2009.In brief, a runaway girl materializes on the doorstep of a retired physics professor. The professor is a confirmed curmudgeon and, to some extent, a misanthrope. His manner of speech takes the form of amusing 1-liners, regarding the fruitlessness of human society. The professor takes the girl in, and she lives with him, and they have a sort of father/daughter relationship. Over the course of weeks, the girl adopts the same speech patterns as the professor, and she spews out the same amusing 1-liners about the futility of human society. The girl's father and mother, both devoted Christians, split up prior to the girl's running away from home. The problem was that the father was having an affair with another woman.The girl is from the American South, and prefers Louisiana-style cooking, and has a southern accent. About half-way into the movie, the girl's mother materializes at the front door of the professor's house. Unexpectedly, the mother quickly adopts to the lifestyle of New York City, and her collection of casual family snapshots is ""discovered"" by an art critic, and the mother has an art exhibition in a gallery (not an exhibition in a mere coffeeshop). (The fact that the mother, a mere picture-taker, has an exhibit at an art gallery, is a slap in the face to any person who has really had a 1-person show in a recognized art gallery.) Also, the mother acquires two boyfriends. One of the boyfriends is a middle-aged man who is a philosophy professor, and the 3 of them sleep together. Thus, the storyline is utterly bizarre. It is not art. It is not entertainment. It is not creative. It is not interesting. It is just random garbage.Towards the end of the movie, the girl's father materializes at the front door of the professor's house. He also, came is search of the runaway daughter. As the man's character develops, during the remaining thirty or so minutes of the film, he discovers that he is really gay, and he quickly develops a gay relationship with a man he finds in a tavern. But again, this makes the storyline too disjointed. The storyline goes ""off-topic"" too often in this movie.On the plus side, the actress playing the girl is abundantly easy on the eye. But on the minus side, WHATEVER WORKS is fraught with improbabilities. First of all, it is not often that an astonishingly beautiful girl shows up on a man's doorsteps, as a runaway. Second, it is not often that a 20-year old girl marries a 70-year old man who is a retired professor (this is what happens in WHATEVER WORKS). Third, it is not often that a southern housewife is promoted as a photographer, on the basis of her ""portfolio"" of casual family snapshots, and has a photography exhibit at a lower Manhattan art gallery. Fourth, it is not often that a physics professor tries twice to commit suicide (this is what happens in WHATEVER WORKS). To summarize, this movie consists of a re-cycling of things that Woody Allen likes and finds dear (younger girlfriends, New York City art galleries, talking about excessively personal hang-ups in ordinary conversations). We have seen the same themes, again and again, since the 1970s in Woody Allen movies. The contrived marriage of the 70-year old man with the 20-year old girl, obviously mirrors Woody Allen's own marriage to his step-daughter (Soon-Yi) who is thirty years younger than himself.WHATEVER WORKS could be the very best of all of the Woody Allen films that utilize the above collection of themes. But on the other hand, what prevents this movie from having much more value than a typical made-for-TV movie, is that fact that it consists of a studied melange of incoherent and incompatible things, squeezed and forced together, into a single storyline.(Also, this movie is NOT a comedy. There is nothing here to make you laugh. The movie is merely amusing.)Perhaps the only believable part of WHATEVER WORKS, is the professor's schmoozing with his friends, at a sidewalk coffeeshop. In fact, if the entire movie had taken place on the sidewalk table, at the coffeeshop, documented the conversations of three mature men, I might have given the film FIVE STARS. To emphasize this point, if this movie was more like, MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, then that would have been fine with me.The star of this movie is Mr. Larry David. Mr. David is one of the most successful people in the history of Hollywood, having been one of the founders of the SEINFELD show, and having written 62 episodes of SEINFELD. But in my opinion, even if the cast consists of seven Academy Award winners, it cannot convert such a bizarre, improbable, contrived script into a watchable film. Basically that is my point -- the movie WHATEVER WORKS borders on being unwatchable.",2,"The story contains so many improbable elements, that it makes the movie almost unwatchable.

Old or young.  No-sir, no-sir ... NO-SIR!In ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" you had the nerve, the chutzpah, to cast yourself as a leading man opposite what's-her-name, the shiksa, Helen Hunt. ... Woody, my boy, she's half your age! ... Okay, so I schtupped Sophie Tucker when I was 17-years-old and she was growing a mustache, so sue me -- but *you,* Woodala, a little twerp like you, do you really think these young gals go for you, or is it all that loot you've made preaching morality to the masses?With your one year of college and the philosphy class you jerked around in.From you, morality?  Ho boy!  This is like asking Humbert Humbert for directions to a convent for pre-pubescent nuns.Okay, got your thinking cap on now, Woody, mensch that you think you are?  Got that thinking cap in place?  In this movie, ""Whatever Works,"" there's an old guy played by Larry David.  Okay, guess who he's supposed to be.Think hard now.And he falls in love with a young girl about one-thirteenth his age.Now guess who *she's* supposed to be.Take your time, you yutz.  Pretty soon it'll all be clear.I mean, are you delusional, or what?  We know already what you have to say about old men and young girls, and if it's not immature, it's tiresome.  And if it's not puerile, it's doggie ca-ca.  Your Freshman Philosophy 101 pontificating gives me *such* a pain, you have no idea.  Right in the tukas.  I wouldn't wish such a pain on the Arab who's in business next door to me.Get a life, Woody my boy!  Punch a ball.  Run after a car.  Sit, have a cup- coffee.  Just stop making movies!Here's a thought.  You wanna know about existential dread, instead of just pontificating about it?  Get a job in the Post Office!  *Then* write a movie!  Philosophize your head off.  We'll be waiting with baited breath.You know, Amazon has its star ratings, but I have my (are you ready for this?) I have my Yasha Banana ""Ca-Ca Ratings.""  And you hold the all-time ca-ca record.  Yes, you do!  In fact, in this movie, you made such a big, smelly ca-ca that farmers from miles will line up to buy some.And all over the nice rug.  Ya happy, Stewart Alan Konisberg?  Ya happy?  Would it help if we took your rattle away?Better yet, maybe we should put salt-peter in your pablum.Listen carefully now, Mister Woody Allen. ... We don't *care* that for you life stinks.  Did you ever think that maybe YOU stink?  See, simple, you just got it backwards. Life doesn't stink: *you* stink.Please, take some advice from me, Yasha J. Banana: nonogenarian, flute-tuner and part-time exercise boy at Belmont Park -- you're 75-years-old -- crying, screaming and throwing a tantrum that life's no good and we're all gonna die, over and over and over -- in *all* your movies ... should embarrass you, you big cry baby.Why, if I was 20 years younger I'd depants you myself, you little cocker!Listen, bubi, I'm not saying don't nem di gelt.  Sure, take the money and run.  You never know when an extra million or two can help you through a rough patch of existential dread.  Still, genius-philosopher that you are, you don't see the irony do you?  You're critical, movie after movie, as regards how stupid and short-sighted people are, but these are the same people stupid enough to say how great you are.  These are the same  people -- the people you look down on -- who've made you rich and famous.You're a self-loathing narcissist.  And from this you've made a fortune.  (And without even a partner already!)  Mazel tov.  You're a regular Willie Sutton: you know where the money is -- in people's longing to be as narcissistic as you are!  You're a role model for infantile narcissism!Called before the court of public opinion, here's what I suggest you say in your defense: ""I STINK AND I CAN PROVE IT!""So go ahead, pour your heart and soul out to the anonymous strangers who see your movies.  God knows, self-absorbed that you are, those strangers are no doubt the only people you can relate to, you oversocialized, latte-sipping ying-yang, you.Consider yourself lucky that in a culture of narcissism, you're America's poster boychick.Consider yourself lucky that for someone who's taken P.T. Barnum advice to heart (""There's a sucker born every minute; and two guys to take him""), as well as that of H.L. Mencken (""You'll never go broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public) ... you're making a nice living.You should be the happiest person in the world!  For someone who a.) has never done an honest day's work in his life, and b.) knows absolutely nothing about how billions of people live -- NEM DI GELT!  Be lucky that you're not blocking hats, or selling aluminum siding, or trying to find parts for a '79 Dodge Dart.(Do you have any?  Maybe you could ask around??)Most moviemakers, insulated as they are from the real work, have absolutely no  idea as regards the, as Howard Zinn put it, ""felt lives"" of average human beings.  You, Woody Allen, being a case in point. ... The directors who worked in Hollywood in the 30s, 40s and 50s, some of them still working on into the 60s and 70s -- these were individuals who had ""lived life.""  Billy Wilder, Fritz Lang, Douglas Sirk, Edgar Ulmer, Robert Siodmak, Max Ophuls, John Huston, Ernst Lubitsch, John Ford, Samuel Fuller, Erich Von Stroheim.  You could see it in their work and you could see it in their faces.I look at your face, Woody my boy, and I get nau-u-u-u-seous.  Pastrami sandwiches I ate back in 1957 threaten to reappear.  What have *you* experienced, you schmuck poseur? -- other than air conditioning, cable teevee and bothering young girls?(By the way, before I forget, if you have any extra young girls, put them in a box and mail them to me, will'ya?  I'll pay the postage.)Now, where was I?  Oh yeah, I'm sorry you're overcome with guilt.  After I give myself an enema I'm going to have a tree planted in Israel for you, I feel so bad about your guilt.Still, it's understandable -- why *shouldn't* you feel guilty?  You've made the same shallow, self-absorbed, self-indulgent, movie over and over and over, for several decades now.  WHINE, WHINE, WHINE! If there was an Olympic Whining Team, you'd not only be the captain, you'd complain about the accomodations.The fact that you're still making the same movie, still dishing out the same pseudo-philosophical ca-ca, over and over and over, reminds me of when they nabbed Jim Bakker.  You know, the religious fake, the husband of Tammy Lee Bakker.  After he was convicted, the newspaper guys asked our boy Jim: ""Why'd you do it?  Why'd you steal all those millions?""  To which the not-so-right Reverend Bakker replied: ""Because people kept sending me money.  What was I supposed to do?""Alas, this is your tragedy, Woody my boy.  This is why you're constantly whining.  This is why you're so unhappy, so riddled with guilt.  Because you know you're a diminutive, no-talent schwit -- BUT PEOPLE KEEP COMING TO YOUR MOVIES! -- and what are you supposed to do, screw the pooch, let them in on the con, tell them you're a no-talent fraud?(By the way, just box and mail to me one young girl at a time, k?  I may be short that week, re. the postage due.)Meanwhile, take a hike.  I told you about the enema I'm going to give myself?  I can't waste anymore time trying to straighten you out, my kishkas are rolling around like Eddie Cantor's eyeballs.Hoping everything comes out all right.  For me that is,Your pal,YashP.S.
