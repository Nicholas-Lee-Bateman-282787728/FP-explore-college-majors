1061491,A3J7J0DIZS8ELH,B000NXI7CC,"Douglas Herman ""Douglas Herman""","[6, 6]","Two things keep you glued to this movie. Well, make that three things. The story of a working class Bolivian guy who wants to get a visa to visit his son in America. When he runs into complications during his stay in Lima, he decides to heist some cash from a gold broker to grease the palm of corrupt officials.  Meanwhile his neighbor, a stripper-with-the-proverbial-heart-of-gold takes a liking to him. She takes him to her club and he watches her dance. Worth renting the movie for that scene alone. So we (a) wonder whether she'll get her guy and (b) whether he'll pull off the heist without getting caught or killed, and (c) whether he'll ever get to America.Lots of helicopter shots of Lima on clear days and nights, so this ain't Slumdog, although I'm sure Lima has lots of them. Well worth renting or owning, simply to see how Latin filmmakers make movies without resorting to (a) fistfights or (b) shootouts to move the story along. Very good performances by both leads, Kate del Castillo especially.",4,Better Than Most Hollywood Romances,1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,1010,"['Two', 'things', 'keep', 'glued', 'movie', 'Well', 'make', 'three', 'things', 'story', 'working', 'class', 'Bolivian', 'guy', 'who', 'get', 'visa', 'visit', 'son', 'America', 'When', 'complications', 'stay', 'Lima', 'heist', 'cash', 'gold', 'broker', 'grease', 'palm', 'corrupt', 'officials', 'Meanwhile', 'neighbor', 'stripper-with-the-proverbial-heart-of-gold', 'liking', 'club', 'dance', 'renting', 'movie', 'scene', 'alone', 'wonder', ""'ll"", 'get', 'guy', 'b', ""'ll"", 'pull', 'off', 'heist', 'getting', 'caught', 'killed', 'c', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'get', 'America.Lots', 'helicopter', 'shots', 'Lima', 'clear', 'days', 'nights', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Slumdog', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Lima', 'lots', 'Well', 'renting', 'owning', 'simply', 'see', 'how', 'Latin', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'movies', 'resorting', 'fistfights', 'b', 'move', 'story', 'along', 'Very', 'good', 'performances', 'leads', 'Kate', 'del', 'Castillo', 'especially']",American Visa [NTSC/REGION 4 DVD.
