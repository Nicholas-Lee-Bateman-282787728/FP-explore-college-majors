1188044,A36CDTPDMHWMJ,B001F7MSH0,G. M. Curtis,"[1, 1]","Hi,Look, I liked the series. I liked the fact that they tried - not completely successfully in my view - to make the science only just beyond what is currently achievable. And I really liked that among the extras they included a snippet of educational material about genetic engineering etc. But it fell down for me in a couple of places.The first was the lab itself. I've worked in microbiology research labs. I've never seen a lab so dark. It was clearly done for ambiance etc, but in reality labs just aren't like that. They're light airy places because lets face it, as someone handling any sort of culture or chemical you want to be able to see what you're doing. Second where was the biological containment? They're dealing with among other things the Spanish flu, that's not stuff you leave simply lying around on a work bench.Never mind. That's probably just a pet peeve of mine. What let the series down as a drama for me was the lead actor. I found him so over the top - moody, arrogant, insensitive and basically insufferable that I didn't believe him. I certainly didn't believe him as a father. I get that they wanted him to fill the eccentric obsessed scientist role, but quite frankly I don't know any scientists like that. And to be honest someone who was that way wouldn't be hired and he would absolutely never be put in charge of other people.However the stories were good, the rest of the cast were good, and a few did outstanding acting in some of the minor roles.Cheers, Greg.",4,Good show marred by lead character,1385424000,"11 26, 2013",2013,1498,"['Hi', 'Look', 'liked', 'series', 'liked', 'fact', 'tried', 'not', 'completely', 'successfully', 'view', 'make', 'science', 'only', 'just', 'what', 'currently', 'achievable', 'really', 'liked', 'extras', 'included', 'snippet', 'educational', 'material', 'genetic', 'engineering', 'etc', 'fell', 'down', 'couple', 'places.The', 'first', 'was', 'lab', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'microbiology', 'research', 'labs', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'lab', 'so', 'dark', 'was', 'clearly', 'done', 'ambiance', 'etc', 'reality', 'labs', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'light', 'airy', 'places', 'lets', 'face', 'someone', 'handling', 'sort', 'culture', 'chemical', 'want', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'Second', 'where', 'was', 'biological', 'containment', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'other', 'things', 'Spanish', 'flu', 'not', 'stuff', 'leave', 'simply', 'lying', 'around', 'work', 'bench.Never', 'mind', 'probably', 'just', 'pet', 'peeve', 'mine', 'What', 'let', 'series', 'down', 'drama', 'was', 'lead', 'actor', 'found', 'so', 'top', 'moody', 'arrogant', 'insensitive', 'basically', 'insufferable', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'father', 'get', 'wanted', 'fill', 'eccentric', 'obsessed', 'scientist', 'role', 'quite', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'scientists', 'be', 'honest', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'hired', 'would', 'absolutely', 'never', 'be', 'put', 'charge', 'other', 'stories', 'were', 'good', 'rest', 'cast', 'were', 'good', 'few', 'did', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'minor', 'roles.Cheers', 'Greg']",N/A

Great supporting cast, including Ellen Page as David's Daughter who clearly illustrates her acting chops in a glimpse of what is to come.This show is relevant, topical and compelling at the same time and would likely have died a slow painful death if it premiered in the USA.  Kudos to The Movie Network in Canada allowing this series to have a 4-seasons run.  Unfortunately, only seasons 1-2 are readily available.Season 1-2 are great, season 3 is very good and season 4 stalls a bit, though is still good.Highly recommended as a program that is different from most anything else available.",5,Infectous Diseases and a Young Ellen Page!

They portray him right off the bat as some sort of ladies man, but seriously, take a look at him. There is no way that would be likely in real life. The guy would just barely come in as ""average"" in looks. Certainly no higher. Another thing I hated was him constantly rubbing and scratching and cracking his neck. By the second time he did this I could tell it was intentional and from thereafter looked fake and became annoying as heck.Lastly, if you're not one of those people out there that likes watching the History channel, where you get to learn about mysterious things, such as the human body, then you most likely won't like this series.
