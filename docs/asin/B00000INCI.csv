503985,A3KBCYZ4VX0HN7,B00000INCI,"J. lacy ""clean food cook""","[0, 0]","NOTE: A few but somewhat vague ""spoilers"" in this commentaryThis mini-series is true to B.T.B.'s books and is very typical romance TV production. What does set it a bit above the rest is veteran actress Deborah Kerr's performance as the older character of Emma Harte (who is the central figure in series). Kerr always brought a bit of class and integrity to the projects she starred in and this is no exception.Jenny Seagrove does a fairly good job of portraying the younger Emma through most of the series, and we see her story through flashbacks that Deborah Kerr has looking back on her life; where she goes from being an overworked housemaid who is ultimately betrayed by one of the family brothers who she falls in love with, to her lifelong obsession with becoming rich enough to exact revenge on that family - which she does as she ends up a rich department store magnate who acquires many homes, property, and other forms of wealth.This is formula but it's still entertaining and there are some good and not-so-good appearances by other actors who went on to become more well known. Liam Neeson plays ""Blackie,"" a true and blue friend throughout Emma's life and does a great job - of course he's gone on to become an outstanding actor and major player in the movies. On the other hand, Barry Bostwick (who looks great with his tan and vivid blue eyes) plays the Aussie that Emma falls in love with but when he's actually remembering to attempt an Aussie accent - it's quite bad and half the time he just forgets the accent altogether.Other lesser known actors do quite a good job for this type of series and all-in-all, it's worth the time if you like both romantic dramas and period pieces. There's some lovely scenery in Wales and the series doesn't slow down or drag as there's a lot to cover even in the three (approximately 1 1/2 hour segments).I plan to watch the sequel, ""Hold The Dream"" in which both Kerr and Seagrove return in the major character roles even though the reviews on it aren't as good as they are for this first segment of the series, just to see how it plays out in the 1980s.This series is almost 30 years old so the cinematography and sound isn't as good as series made more recently but again, it's definitely worth watching for those of us who love romance, drama, and period pieces!",4,Very Barbara Taylor Bradford,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,2319,"['NOTE', 'few', 'somewhat', 'vague', 'spoilers', 'commentaryThis', 'mini-series', 'true', 'B.T.B', 'books', 'very', 'typical', 'romance', 'TV', 'production', 'What', 'set', 'bit', 'rest', 'veteran', 'actress', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'performance', 'older', 'character', 'Emma', 'Harte', 'who', 'central', 'figure', 'series', 'Kerr', 'always', 'brought', 'bit', 'class', 'integrity', 'projects', 'starred', 'exception.Jenny', 'Seagrove', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'younger', 'Emma', 'most', 'series', 'see', 'story', 'flashbacks', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'looking', 'back', 'life', 'where', 'being', 'overworked', 'housemaid', 'who', 'ultimately', 'betrayed', 'one', 'family', 'brothers', 'who', 'love', 'lifelong', 'obsession', 'becoming', 'rich', 'enough', 'exact', 'revenge', 'family', 'up', 'rich', 'department', 'store', 'magnate', 'who', 'many', 'homes', 'property', 'other', 'forms', 'wealth.This', 'formula', 'still', 'entertaining', 'are', 'good', 'not-so-good', 'appearances', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'went', 'become', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Blackie', 'true', 'blue', 'friend', 'Emma', 'life', 'great', 'job', 'course', 'gone', 'become', 'outstanding', 'actor', 'major', 'player', 'movies', 'other', 'hand', 'Barry', 'Bostwick', 'who', 'great', 'tan', 'vivid', 'blue', 'eyes', 'Aussie', 'Emma', 'love', 'when', 'actually', 'remembering', 'attempt', 'Aussie', 'accent', 'quite', 'bad', 'time', 'just', 'accent', 'altogether.Other', 'lesser', 'known', 'actors', 'do', 'quite', 'good', 'job', 'type', 'series', 'all-in-all', 'time', 'like', 'romantic', 'dramas', 'period', 'pieces', 'lovely', 'scenery', 'Wales', 'series', ""n't"", 'slow', 'down', 'drag', 'lot', 'cover', 'even', 'three', 'approximately', '1', '1/2', 'hour', 'segments', '.I', 'plan', 'watch', 'sequel', 'Hold', 'Dream', 'Kerr', 'Seagrove', 'return', 'major', 'character', 'roles', 'even', 'reviews', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'are', 'first', 'segment', 'series', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'out', '1980s.This', 'series', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'old', 'cinematography', 'sound', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'series', 'made', 'more', 'recently', 'again', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'who', 'love', 'romance', 'drama', 'period', 'pieces']",A Woman of Substance VHS

The location in which the miniseries was shot was great.  It provided a great picture of the areas in which Emma lived throughout her life.What I found most entertaining and just absolutely wonderful was the fact that this movie followed the book!  I was completely thrilled while watching this movie that it so closely followed the book.  I dislike watching a movie based on a book only to have things happen differently than the book.  That is clearly not the case in this movie.This DVD has a few extra features including an interview with Barbara Taylor Bradford and the filmographies of the actors.  It also has an interview with Diane Baker who played Laura and was also the producer of the film. I found the interview with Barbara Taylor Bradford to be entertaining and informative.  She seems to be a wonderful lady and it was great to hear her story and her writing history.A Woman of Substance is an excellent movie based on an excellent book.

Or perhaps it's &quot;The Manions of America&quot;. For me and my sister, it's Barbara Taylor Bradford's &quot;A Woman of Substance&quot;.  Emma Harte (the older version played by &quot;The King and I&quot;'s Deborah Kerr)is a multimillionare and head of her own corporation. Four of her 5 children are greedy little buggers, and Emma becomes aware of a plot they've hatched to render her incompitent and declare themselves the legal heirs of her massive fortune. As Emma contemplates this, she falls asleep in her armchair, and through her dreams, we're transported back in time when young Emma (Jenny Seagrove) is a scullery maid for the Fairley family in their posh mansion. Emma meets Blackie O'Neal (played by the yummy Liam Neeson, who alone is worth watching this)and strikes up a lifelong friendship with him. Blackie is the first person to help Emma see that she, too, can be the head of her own fortune with careful planning and saving. Meanwhile, Emma falls in love with Edwin, the youngest Fairely son, and he loves her as well. When Emma becomes pregnant with Edwin's child, however, he withdraws and offers no support. So, Emma packs her bags and, with Blackie's help, finds a woman to stay with until her baby is born. This is just the first in a series of difficult events that begin to shape the woman Emma is to become. Her hatred for the Fairley family evolves into a lifelong goal to ruin them. She eventually marries a man named Joe and opens her first store (in which she is confronted by Adam Fairley, Edwins bully older brother, who, unsuccessfully, attempts to rape her. It is here that we first hear Emma's designs: &quot;Here this now&quot;, she says to Adam, &quot;I mean to ruin you...the whole Fairley family.&quot;). When Joe is killed in the war, Emma plunges herself in her stores, now a successful chain, but tends to neglect her children. Through it all, Emma survives- from losing her parents, to watching her brother have his leg amputated after a war injury, to meeting and losing the love of her life, Paul McGill (played by a very tan Barry Bostwick of &quot;Spin City&quot;, who is meant to be Australian, but could have used some help w/ that poor on again/off again accent). Through it all, Emma conquers her enemies and her demons, sometimes at the expense of others. But, as she says, the secret of life is &quot;to endure&quot;, and she does.
