It did introduce us to Losin' Your Mind, which we really enjoyed.  We were hoping this would be much more like what we saw this summer at Gigantour. It was a good concert though, showing Zakk's versatility. Honestly, if we knew when we bought it what we knew now, we wouldn't have bought it. But not because it wasn't good, but because it wasn't what we were looking for.",4,Not expected...,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,492,"['guess', 'should', 'have', 'read', 'setlist', 'purchasing', 'did', ""n't"", 'contain', 'what', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'did', 'introduce', 'Losin', 'Mind', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'saw', 'summer', 'Gigantour', 'was', 'good', 'concert', 'showing', 'Zakk', 'versatility', 'Honestly', 'knew', 'when', 'bought', 'what', 'knew', 'now', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bought', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'were', 'looking']",N/A

However, I'm impressed with how Zakk clearly wanted this to be as great as possible...and appears to be on top of his game, along with the band.  He's certainly had some quality issues at some shows after having too much of a good time.  Great added in video elements and a couple of older videos which are totally outstanding - one with his daughter, and one with Pride & Glory (a very under-rated band!).  A bit disappointed in any 'interviews' he does for these DVDs as none of his answers are at all serious and completely sarcastic when we'd like a little reality out of him.  He's one of the all time great guitarists that hopefully someday will open up to explaining some of that greatness.",5,Excellent audio and video quality - Zakk on his game,1381017600,"10 6, 2013",2013,783,"['have', 'everything', 'Zakk', 'Wylde', 'ever', 'put', 'tape', 'CD', 'etc', 'so', 'yes', 'clearly', 'biased', 'However', ""'m"", 'impressed', 'how', 'Zakk', 'clearly', 'wanted', 'be', 'as', 'great', 'possible', 'be', 'top', 'game', 'band', 'certainly', 'had', 'quality', 'issues', 'shows', 'having', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'time', 'Great', 'added', 'video', 'elements', 'couple', 'older', 'videos', 'are', 'totally', 'outstanding', 'one', 'daughter', 'one', 'Pride', 'Glory', 'very', 'under-rated', 'band', 'bit', 'disappointed', ""'interviews"", 'DVDs', 'none', 'answers', 'are', 'serious', 'completely', 'sarcastic', 'when', ""'d"", 'like', 'little', 'reality', 'one', 'time', 'great', 'guitarists', 'hopefully', 'someday', 'will', 'open', 'up', 'explaining', 'greatness']",N/A

The guys were all sitting down, and even though they played some of their heavier, more rockin songs, the real vibe was pretty mellow and appreciative. It just seemed like the band wanted to share their appreciation for their fans by revealing more of themselves and making the show an approachable and memorable experience. I thought it was a stellar concert video with excellent production and a nice window into not only Zakk, but also the rest of the band. I highly recommend this blu-ray for any fans of the band or the genre. There are plenty of electric songs, but they definitely dont shy away from the acoustic pieces and the piano pieces. Definitely a keeper.",5,Excellent concert video in an intimate setting,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",2014,767,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'venue', 'was', 'quite', 'large', 'show', 'stage', 'setting', 'was', 'very', 'intimate', 'guys', 'were', 'sitting', 'down', 'even', 'played', 'heavier', 'more', 'rockin', 'songs', 'real', 'vibe', 'was', 'pretty', 'mellow', 'appreciative', 'just', 'seemed', 'band', 'wanted', 'share', 'appreciation', 'fans', 'revealing', 'more', 'making', 'show', 'approachable', 'memorable', 'experience', 'thought', 'was', 'stellar', 'concert', 'video', 'excellent', 'production', 'nice', 'window', 'not', 'only', 'Zakk', 'also', 'rest', 'band', 'highly', 'recommend', 'blu-ray', 'fans', 'band', 'genre', 'are', 'plenty', 'electric', 'songs', 'definitely', 'dont', 'shy', 'away', 'acoustic', 'pieces', 'piano', 'pieces', 'Definitely', 'keeper']",N/A

It was a good show though... The camera work was good, the sound was good, the lighting was decent. If your a BLS fan or not, I see no reason you wouldn't enjoy this show?

Right from the start of the thumping beat when the band kicks in to LOSING YOUR MIND, we get to see the skill and professionalism that makes up the brilliance of BLACK LABEL SOCIETY. Through the light and shade of some well-chosen songs, we experience one hour and 38 minutes of aural brilliance; we get to see the playing that is both the hallmark of Zach Wylde's brilliant diversity, and the reason why he has such a solid following. The 17 songs in the Blu-ray concert superbly mixed, and provide an excellent experience of Zach and his associates.I would highly recommend that you get the double CD, which has 23 songs and is just as superbly mixed.The extras on the Blu-ray are absolutely awesome. The visit to a UK prison has 55 minutes of playing and talking, both are things which come across superbly. The video quality of the UK prison visit is not as good as the concert, but I have no complaints, since the audio of Zach's playing and the Q and A are extremely good. There is an interview for the concert which is about six minutes and 15 seconds, and is thoroughly enjoyable. THE LOSING YOUR MIND video is from 1994 and is top-notch, a very nice inclusion. The photo gallery from rehearsal production and completion of the concert is great, and lasts about five minutes 20 seconds. All in all a great experience, great extras, and typical delivery of Zach Wylds excellence.",5,"Un-blackened or not, the music rocks",1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,1478,"['get', 'impression', 'concert', 'was', 'called', 'UNBLACKENED', 'catchy', 'title', 'Right', 'start', 'thumping', 'beat', 'when', 'band', 'kicks', 'LOSING', 'YOUR', 'MIND', 'get', 'see', 'skill', 'professionalism', 'up', 'brilliance', 'BLACK', 'LABEL', 'SOCIETY', 'light', 'shade', 'well-chosen', 'songs', 'experience', 'one', 'hour', '38', 'minutes', 'aural', 'brilliance', 'get', 'see', 'playing', 'hallmark', 'Zach', 'Wylde', 'brilliant', 'diversity', 'reason', 'why', 'solid', 'following', '17', 'songs', 'Blu-ray', 'concert', 'superbly', 'mixed', 'provide', 'excellent', 'experience', 'Zach', 'associates.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'get', 'double', 'CD', '23', 'songs', 'just', 'superbly', 'extras', 'Blu-ray', 'are', 'absolutely', 'awesome', 'visit', 'UK', 'prison', '55', 'minutes', 'playing', 'talking', 'are', 'things', 'come', 'superbly', 'video', 'quality', 'UK', 'prison', 'visit', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'concert', 'have', 'complaints', 'audio', 'Zach', 'playing', 'Q', 'A', 'are', 'extremely', 'good', 'interview', 'concert', 'six', 'minutes', '15', 'seconds', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'THE', 'LOSING', 'YOUR', 'MIND', 'video', '1994', 'top-notch', 'very', 'nice', 'inclusion', 'photo', 'gallery', 'rehearsal', 'production', 'completion', 'concert', 'great', 'about', 'five', 'minutes', '20', 'seconds', 'great', 'experience', 'great', 'extras', 'typical', 'delivery', 'Zach', 'Wylds', 'excellence']",N/A
