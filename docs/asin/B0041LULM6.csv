1381923,A3RNU1MITRIG0U,B0041LULM6,"Joanne ""Library Mom""","[0, 1]","Wanted to see Reedus in roles outside of Walking Dead.  The story itself has holes that keep it from being really good.  What was the basis for Ashley's murder?  There must've been some motivation but it's never addressed.  It seems Vincent finds Alice mostly irritating but once the murder mystery is &#34;solved&#34; he just slips into a relationship with her.  It's like a switch flipped somewhere and it's not realistic. The attack on Roger and his subsequent return from that ordeal is somewhat unbelievable.  Roger's character is very vague. Is he crazy?  A recovering alcoholic? Both? Victim/Predator? Is Vincent aware of Alice's involvement in all of this? Interesting twist at the end but the holes int he plot make for a mediocre resolution. Alice is very unbalanced and Vincent doesn't seem like the type to fall for that kind of girl.  Acting overall is good, Keitel is great. Very slow first half, picks up later.",3,Story could've been better developed,1400198400,"05 16, 2014",2014,926,"['Wanted', 'see', 'Reedus', 'roles', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'story', 'holes', 'keep', 'being', 'really', 'good', 'What', 'was', 'basis', 'Ashley', 'murder', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'motivation', 'never', 'addressed', 'Vincent', 'Alice', 'mostly', 'irritating', 'once', 'murder', 'mystery', '34', 'solved', '34', 'just', 'relationship', 'switch', 'flipped', 'somewhere', 'not', 'realistic', 'attack', 'Roger', 'subsequent', 'return', 'ordeal', 'somewhat', 'unbelievable', 'Roger', 'character', 'very', 'vague', 'crazy', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'Victim/Predator', 'Vincent', 'aware', 'Alice', 'involvement', 'Interesting', 'twist', 'end', 'holes', 'int', 'plot', 'make', 'mediocre', 'resolution', 'Alice', 'very', 'unbalanced', 'Vincent', ""n't"", 'seem', 'type', 'fall', 'kind', 'girl', 'Acting', 'overall', 'good', 'Keitel', 'great', 'Very', 'slow', 'first', 'half', 'up', 'later']",A Crime
1381924,A84SIUM0F6E8H,B0041LULM6,"kei. ""g.k. bevido""","[14, 14]","Harvey Keitel and Norman Reedus give great performances as they usually do and if you like them, you'll enjoy this movie. Reedus plays Vincent, who can't continue his life until he finds his wife's murderer. Keitel, a cabbie, is a victim who unwittingly becomes a part of Vincent's madness. The ""crime"" committed is a pretty good one in theory, but like most crimes it's not perfect. A Crime keeps you guessing, even if it moves kind of slow for a thriller.  Emanuelle Beart, who plays Vincent's new girlfriend Alice, annoys me to no end in this film - I don't know that she is SUPPOSED to or what. I've watched A Crime a few times and liked it better each time ... but again, I have to say, Beart's Alice is an unlikeable, shallow, conniving bitch who almost makes me want to stop watching yet there I am up to the end as if something will change. I mention this because her role is integral in this whole 'crime'. I still don't know if this is just good acting on her part or if I just personally find her/Alice despicable (LOL).",4,A Crime,1321056000,"11 12, 2011",2011,1031,"['Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'give', 'great', 'performances', 'usually', 'do', 'like', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Reedus', 'Vincent', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'continue', 'life', 'wife', 'murderer', 'Keitel', 'cabbie', 'victim', 'who', 'unwittingly', 'part', 'Vincent', 'madness', 'crime', 'committed', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'theory', 'most', 'crimes', 'not', 'perfect', 'Crime', 'keeps', 'guessing', 'even', 'kind', 'slow', 'thriller', 'Emanuelle', 'Beart', 'who', 'Vincent', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Alice', 'end', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'SUPPOSED', 'what', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'A', 'Crime', 'few', 'times', 'liked', 'better', 'time', 'again', 'have', 'say', 'Beart', 'Alice', 'unlikeable', 'shallow', 'conniving', 'bitch', 'who', 'almost', 'want', 'stop', 'watching', 'yet', 'am', 'up', 'end', 'something', 'will', 'change', 'mention', 'role', 'integral', 'whole', ""'crime"", 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'good', 'acting', 'part', 'just', 'personally', 'find', 'her/Alice', 'despicable', 'LOL']",A Crime

1381929,A387BD735MI50R,B0041LULM6,R. Schultz,"[1, 2]","This crime story has a rather unbelievable, but nevertheless compelling premise. When a man's wife is killed by gunfire coming from what he glimpses as a passing taxi driver - the man finds it impossible to move on with his life. He dwells on the sheer inexplicability of the unsolved murder. Another young woman aspiring to have a relationship with the anguished man decides to shake him out of his entrenched grief by pinning the murder on someone - anyone. She picks a working cab driver at random and proceeds to frame him for the murder. In order to maneuver the driver into the appearance of guilt, she has to get close to him. And so starts a vaguely surreal, down-and-dirty romance with the cab driver.Yes, this plot is resting on very shaky psychological ground and proceeds from one improbability to another. It also seems to be the product of an uneasy American-French collaboration. The action is supposed to be taking place in the U.S. and stars American actor Harvey Keitel, but I think I glimpsed the Eiffel Tower in the background as the cab driver and his new paramour are presumably skimming away from something like the Verrazano Bridge.Despite these lapses, I found myself getting drawn into the off-beat atmosphere of this film. It has a certain French New Wave quality about it, featuring people wandering in the purple estrangement of urban settings. What's more, Harvey Keitel has a grungy masculine appeal that becomes more memorable the farther I move away from having viewed ""The Crime."" There's also the novelty of a boomerang playing a featured role in the film, ready to come back and hit you with any number of different morals to the story.",4,Another Taxi Driver Takes You for a Ride,1299628800,"03 9, 2011",2011,1672,"['crime', 'story', 'rather', 'unbelievable', 'nevertheless', 'compelling', 'premise', 'When', 'man', 'wife', 'killed', 'gunfire', 'coming', 'what', 'passing', 'taxi', 'driver', 'man', 'impossible', 'move', 'life', 'sheer', 'inexplicability', 'unsolved', 'murder', 'young', 'woman', 'aspiring', 'have', 'relationship', 'anguished', 'man', 'shake', 'entrenched', 'grief', 'pinning', 'murder', 'someone', 'anyone', 'working', 'cab', 'driver', 'random', 'proceeds', 'frame', 'murder', 'order', 'maneuver', 'driver', 'appearance', 'guilt', 'get', 'close', 'so', 'vaguely', 'surreal', 'down-and-dirty', 'romance', 'cab', 'driver.Yes', 'plot', 'resting', 'very', 'shaky', 'psychological', 'ground', 'proceeds', 'one', 'improbability', 'also', 'be', 'product', 'uneasy', 'American-French', 'collaboration', 'action', 'supposed', 'be', 'taking', 'place', 'U.S.', 'stars', 'American', 'actor', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'think', 'glimpsed', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'background', 'cab', 'driver', 'new', 'paramour', 'are', 'presumably', 'skimming', 'away', 'something', 'Verrazano', 'Bridge.Despite', 'lapses', 'found', 'getting', 'drawn', 'off-beat', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'certain', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'quality', 'featuring', 'people', 'wandering', 'purple', 'estrangement', 'urban', 'settings', 'What', 'more', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'grungy', 'masculine', 'appeal', 'more', 'memorable', 'farther', 'move', 'away', 'having', 'viewed', 'Crime', 'also', 'novelty', 'boomerang', 'playing', 'featured', 'role', 'film', 'ready', 'come', 'back', 'hit', 'number', 'different', 'morals', 'story']",A Crime

Kelly ""dkelly26666""","[6, 7]","I saw this film on an import DVD some time ago (it's actually from 2006, just now getting a U.S. release), and it's actually a pretty decent little thriller.Fans of Harvey Keitel and/or Norman Reedus will probably enjoy their performances here. Keitel is actually pretty creepy here.Film has a nice, noirish-type look and feel, and there are some genuinely tense moments. Story is about a young man whose wife was brutally murdered by a serial killer the cops never found. He is unable to get on with his life due to his obsession with finding the killer. His neighbor is a lonely, awkward young woman who wants to reach him, so she sets up a seemingly innocent cab driver to take the fall so the young guy can ""get on"" with his life, and be open to her. Naturally, things go way, way out of hand. All the characters are pretty unlikable, but the story certainly has some originality, and there are some good twists.Only a totally unbelievable final twist nearly ruins everything (just so the story can be tied up neatly at the end). All in all, a watchable, pulpy little indie thriller.The director, Manuel Pradal, has worked with Keitel before, on ""Ginostra"".",3,"Decent, minor thriller for Keitel / Reedus fans",1289692800,"11 14, 2010",2010,1161,"['saw', 'film', 'import', 'DVD', 'time', 'actually', '2006', 'just', 'now', 'getting', 'U.S.', 'release', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'little', 'thriller.Fans', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'and/or', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'performances', 'here', 'Keitel', 'actually', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'here.Film', 'nice', 'noirish-type', 'look', 'feel', 'are', 'genuinely', 'tense', 'moments', 'Story', 'young', 'man', 'wife', 'was', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'serial', 'killer', 'cops', 'never', 'found', 'unable', 'get', 'life', 'due', 'obsession', 'finding', 'killer', 'neighbor', 'lonely', 'awkward', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'reach', 'up', 'seemingly', 'innocent', 'cab', 'driver', 'take', 'fall', 'so', 'young', 'guy', 'can', 'get', 'life', 'be', 'open', 'Naturally', 'things', 'go', 'way', 'way', 'hand', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'unlikable', 'story', 'certainly', 'originality', 'are', 'good', 'twists.Only', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'final', 'twist', 'nearly', 'everything', 'just', 'so', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'tied', 'up', 'neatly', 'end', 'watchable', 'pulpy', 'little', 'indie', 'thriller.The', 'director', 'Manuel', 'Pradal', 'worked', 'Keitel', 'before', 'Ginostra']",A Crime
