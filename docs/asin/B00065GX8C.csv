Each season was well done, the actors were great, the storylines were fantastic, and then Richard Coyle, who played the apparently irreplaceable Jeff Murdock, left the show. The only shows in this final season that are funny or even tolerable are the ones that new cast member Richard Mylan isn't in. To be honest, it isn't even the fault of the character as written. Richard Coyle could have played the character of Oliver and made it hysterical. It is the absolute over-acting by Mylan in every scene. His scenes are just painful and are to be ff through.

861177,A1T17LMQABMBN5,B00065GX8C,CoffeeGurl,"[2, 4]","I have looked forward to getting Coupling's fourth season on DVD.  I couldn't wait to watch more clever episodes like the ones in the first three seasons.  I knew that Richard Coyle (Jeff) had left the show.  I knew the show wouldn't be the same with such an incredible character, but I was willing the give the new guy a chance. Oliver (played by Richard Mylan) is a blatant Jeff knock-off who does not steal the scenes and make you laugh the way the aforementioned character had done.  Oliver has some lines that had obviously been intended for Jeff.  The comparisons are inevitable -- and Steven Moffat, the show's writer, is partly to blame for that, for Oliver, like Jeff, cannot talk to women without chocking on his own words.  However, Mylan does add a bit of his own style to the mix.  He uses a slapstick approach with the use of physical comedy in various scenes (especially in the episode ""Bedtime"").  Oliver is also not as sex-obsessed as Jeff.  The character's development was slow though.  But he grew on me in ""The Naked Living Room,"" where he shows Jane his ""unedited"" flat and ends up opening up to her in a very vulnerable way.  The rest of the characters show a great deal of growth and more depth in this season.  Coyle's departure is a mixed blessing because it allows the characters to be more dimensional now that Jeff is not around to steal the spotlight. Steve and Susan deal with their pending parenthood, Patrick and Sally discuss the realities of a meaningful relationship, and Jane shows some maturity this time around.  In fact, Jane is far less neurotic on season four.  Her character is almost unrecognizable at times!  But things are not as dull or as bad as they sound.  The show is still hilarious.  Despite the overuse of dream and fantasy sequences and the fact that this season only has six episodes, Coupling is still far cleverer than most American sitcoms I have seen.  My favorite episodes are ""9  Weeks,"" ""Night Lines,"" ""Bedtime,"" ""The Naked Living Room,"" and ""9  Months.""

861178,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B00065GX8C,Cubist,"[6, 7]","Essentially a racier, British version of Friends, Coupling has survived a disastrous attempt at Americanization and the departure of popular cast member Richard Coyle. The addition of Richard Mylan to the cast is hardly a substitute for Coyle who was arguably the funniest cast member on the show but he is fine in his own way and the quality of the writing is still top notch.The quality of the show's writing is still excellent. For example, in one episode Steve refers to child birth as the John Hurt bit, a reference to the slimy creature that bursts out of his chest in Alien. He also describes a child birthing video as ""horror porn,"" - seeing a face coming out of a place where one shouldn't. However, the pairing up of the cast has the potential for disaster as the thrill of the chase is now gone. Of course, this presents a new series of comedic possibilities as the dynamic between couples is explored. Moffat also continues his spot-on parodies of British popular culture, including one clever bit where Patrick imagines himself in an episode of The Prisoner when he's actually having sex with Sally.""Making of Coupling-`From Script to Screen'"" is a 43-minute featurette that traces the development of an episode from the writing phase to rehearsals to actual filming. Now in its fourth season, the process is much more polished. This is a good look at how the show is put together.There are ten minutes of outtakes that include your usual blown lines and flubs but in a way that conveys how much fun the cast must have working on this show.Also included are eight and half minutes of deleted scenes that include more of Steve's dream sequence early on in the season. Most of the bits are amusing in their own right but were rightly cut.""Interview with Richard Mylan"" features the new addition to the cast as he talks about the daunting task of replacing Richard Coyle and how he got on with the rest of the cast.Finally, there are some very detailed biographies for the cast and crew.",4,Not as good with the new guy but still pretty funny,1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,1997,"['Essentially', 'racier', 'British', 'version', 'Friends', 'Coupling', 'survived', 'disastrous', 'attempt', 'Americanization', 'departure', 'popular', 'cast', 'member', 'Richard', 'Coyle', 'addition', 'Richard', 'Mylan', 'cast', 'hardly', 'substitute', 'Coyle', 'who', 'was', 'arguably', 'funniest', 'cast', 'member', 'show', 'fine', 'own', 'way', 'quality', 'writing', 'still', 'top', 'notch.The', 'quality', 'show', 'writing', 'still', 'excellent', 'example', 'one', 'episode', 'Steve', 'refers', 'child', 'birth', 'John', 'Hurt', 'bit', 'reference', 'slimy', 'creature', 'chest', 'Alien', 'also', 'child', 'birthing', 'video', 'horror', 'porn', 'seeing', 'face', 'coming', 'place', 'where', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'However', 'pairing', 'cast', 'potential', 'disaster', 'thrill', 'chase', 'now', 'gone', 'course', 'new', 'series', 'comedic', 'possibilities', 'dynamic', 'couples', 'explored', 'Moffat', 'also', 'spot-on', 'parodies', 'British', 'popular', 'culture', 'including', 'one', 'clever', 'bit', 'where', 'Patrick', 'episode', 'Prisoner', 'when', 'actually', 'having', 'sex', 'Sally', 'Making', 'Coupling-', 'Script', 'Screen', '43-minute', 'featurette', 'development', 'episode', 'writing', 'phase', 'rehearsals', 'actual', 'filming', 'Now', 'fourth', 'season', 'process', 'much', 'more', 'polished', 'good', 'look', 'how', 'show', 'put', 'are', 'ten', 'minutes', 'outtakes', 'include', 'usual', 'blown', 'lines', 'flubs', 'way', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'cast', 'must', 'have', 'working', 'show.Also', 'included', 'are', 'eight', 'half', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'include', 'more', 'Steve', 'dream', 'sequence', 'early', 'season', 'Most', 'bits', 'are', 'amusing', 'own', 'right', 'were', 'rightly', 'cut', 'Interview', 'Richard', 'Mylan', 'new', 'addition', 'cast', 'daunting', 'task', 'replacing', 'Richard', 'Coyle', 'how', 'got', 'rest', 'cast.Finally', 'are', 'very', 'detailed', 'biographies', 'cast', 'crew']",Coupling - The Complete Fourth Season

It is funny, a little edgy (at least in comparison to American shows) and very entertaining. So of course I was anxiously awaiting the start of the fourth season. Even thought fourth season remained funny, I could not believe that my favorite character - Jeff was no longer part of it. I was and still am puzzled by it, how do you replace the funniest character on the show?Instead we get a less sympathetic and not as funny knockoff called Oliver. And even though Moffat tried to put Oliver in Jeff-like situations with same type of dialog, it's just not the same. I wont Jeff back. In addition to Jeff's departure, it seems like the whole show got toned down a notch. I guess I got used to this show to be unbelievably funny and changes made to it do not seem to make it better.

861182,A3QBFZ4BC3CSH5,B00065GX8C,Heather Baldwin,"[60, 66]","I have been a huge fan of this show from the beginning.  This DVD's release date isn't for a few months, but I wanted to share my insights.  The fourth season starts a few weeks after the end of the third season left off, with lots of new twists and turns, great jokes, and compelling stories.  The bad news is that Richard Coyle, who plays Jeff, left the show (the character travels to the isle of Lesbos, and you fans can easily decipher the joke, I'm sure).  But the good news is that a new character named Oliver, played by Richard Mylan, is an enjoyable enough replacement, despite having big shoes to fill.  Here is a recap of the six episodes (if you haven't seen the finale of season three, then there might be some spoilers):1.) 9 1/2 Minutes - A well-written story from three interweaving points of view, taking place in the bar: a.) Patrick and Sally encounter their first major conflict in their new relationship; b.) Susan is upset with Steve when he shares his odd view about her pregnacy; c.) Jane fears her blind date is her gynecologist, but it turns out to be a goofy guy named Oliver, who runs a sci-fi bookstore.2.) Nightlines - Relationship troubles lead to a late-night phone call between Susan, Sally, Steve, and Patrick.  Out of the blue, Jane joins into the conversation, and it is revealed that she keeps a key to her ex-lover's flat.  But it's not who we expected.  Meanwhile, Oliver receives a visit at his store from his ex-girlfriend Tamsin, whom Susan befriended earlier in the day at a seminar for pregnant women.3.) Bed Time - A battle of wits develops between Patrick and Sally, as Patrick attemps to go home after sex, and Sally finds ways to make him spend the night at her place.  Later, Sally hosts a dinner party and Oliver, Jane's date to the party, worries about his ""nipple erections"".4.) Circus of the Epidurals - Steve and Susan attend an antenatal class, with Tamsin, Sally, Jane, Oliver, and Patrick in tow.  The instructor turns out to be Jill (Jane's former therapist from season one's ""Inferno"").  Steve and the other men in the class are baffled about why a woman in labor would refuse painkillers, leading to a standoff between him and Jill.5.) The Naked Living Room - The evolution Oliver's flat has gone through after his break-up with Tamsin is shown, becoming ""unedited"" as the months pass.  He runs into Jane at the supermarket one day, and completely panics when she asks him to bring her up to his flat.  Later, Susan begins to go into labor.6.) 9 1/2 Months - While waiting for Susan to begin childbirth at the hospital, Steve falls asleep and dreams that a female version of Jeff has returned from Lesbos.  Steve recaps the events of the day to her: a.) Sally and Patrick's relationship changes when she learns the truth about one of his previous partners, and then she discovers a mysterious box hidden in Patrick's video cupboard; b.) Oliver's romantic night with Jane is foiled by the arrival of Steve and Susan on the way to the hospital, and he wonders if Jane still has feelings for Steve.  Finally, Steve and Susan's baby is born.Overall, an excellent group of episodes with many funny and touching moments.  And although the character of Oliver doesn't match the greatness of Jeff's character, fans should still give him a chance.  I highly recommend this DVD, which I'll purchase when it is finally released.",5,"""A hairy, inquisitive sex octopus?""",1097712000,"10 14, 2004",2004,3377,"['have', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'show', 'beginning', 'DVD', 'release', 'date', ""n't"", 'few', 'months', 'wanted', 'share', 'insights', 'fourth', 'season', 'few', 'weeks', 'end', 'third', 'season', 'left', 'off', 'lots', 'new', 'twists', 'turns', 'great', 'jokes', 'compelling', 'stories', 'bad', 'news', 'Richard', 'Coyle', 'who', 'Jeff', 'left', 'show', 'character', 'isle', 'Lesbos', 'fans', 'can', 'easily', 'decipher', 'joke', ""'m"", 'sure', 'good', 'news', 'new', 'character', 'named', 'Oliver', 'played', 'Richard', 'Mylan', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'replacement', 'having', 'big', 'shoes', 'fill', 'Here', 'recap', 'six', 'episodes', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'finale', 'season', 'three', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'spoilers', ':1', '9', '1/2', 'Minutes', 'well-written', 'story', 'three', 'interweaving', 'points', 'view', 'taking', 'place', 'bar', 'Patrick', 'Sally', 'encounter', 'first', 'major', 'conflict', 'new', 'relationship', 'b', 'Susan', 'upset', 'Steve', 'when', 'shares', 'odd', 'view', 'pregnacy', 'c.', 'Jane', 'blind', 'date', 'gynecologist', 'out', 'be', 'goofy', 'guy', 'named', 'Oliver', 'who', 'sci-fi', 'bookstore.2', 'Nightlines', 'Relationship', 'troubles', 'lead', 'late-night', 'phone', 'call', 'Susan', 'Sally', 'Steve', 'Patrick', 'blue', 'Jane', 'conversation', 'revealed', 'key', 'ex-lover', 'flat', 'not', 'who', 'expected', 'Meanwhile', 'Oliver', 'visit', 'store', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Tamsin', 'whom', 'Susan', 'befriended', 'earlier', 'day', 'seminar', 'pregnant', 'women.3', 'Bed', 'Time', 'battle', 'wits', 'develops', 'Patrick', 'Sally', 'Patrick', 'go', 'home', 'sex', 'Sally', 'ways', 'make', 'spend', 'night', 'place', 'Later', 'Sally', 'dinner', 'party', 'Oliver', 'Jane', 'date', 'party', 'worries', 'nipple', 'erections', '.4', 'Circus', 'Epidurals', 'Steve', 'Susan', 'attend', 'antenatal', 'class', 'Tamsin', 'Sally', 'Jane', 'Oliver', 'Patrick', 'tow', 'instructor', 'out', 'be', 'Jill', 'Jane', 'former', 'therapist', 'season', 'one', 'Inferno', 'Steve', 'other', 'men', 'class', 'are', 'baffled', 'why', 'woman', 'labor', 'would', 'refuse', 'painkillers', 'leading', 'standoff', 'Jill.5', 'Naked', 'Living', 'Room', 'evolution', 'Oliver', 'flat', 'gone', 'break-up', 'Tamsin', 'shown', 'becoming', 'unedited', 'months', 'pass', 'Jane', 'supermarket', 'one', 'day', 'completely', 'panics', 'when', 'bring', 'up', 'flat', 'Later', 'Susan', 'go', 'labor.6', '9', '1/2', 'Months', 'waiting', 'Susan', 'begin', 'childbirth', 'hospital', 'Steve', 'asleep', 'female', 'version', 'Jeff', 'returned', 'Lesbos', 'Steve', 'events', 'day', 'Sally', 'Patrick', 'relationship', 'changes', 'when', 'truth', 'one', 'previous', 'partners', 'then', 'mysterious', 'box', 'hidden', 'Patrick', 'video', 'cupboard', 'b', 'Oliver', 'romantic', 'night', 'Jane', 'foiled', 'arrival', 'Steve', 'Susan', 'way', 'hospital', 'Jane', 'still', 'feelings', 'Steve', 'Finally', 'Steve', 'Susan', 'baby', 'born.Overall', 'excellent', 'group', 'episodes', 'many', 'funny', 'touching', 'moments', 'character', 'Oliver', ""n't"", 'match', 'greatness', 'Jeff', 'character', 'fans', 'should', 'still', 'give', 'chance', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'purchase', 'when', 'finally', 'released']",Coupling - The Complete Fourth Season

If you can not handle long periods of laughing, I would not recommend doing this.The season stars shortly after the end of the last one.  Susan is pregnant, Sally and Patrick are together and Jane is alone (we never see how the breakup with the priest unfolds).  The season progresses through Susan's pregnancy until it's end.  Overall the season's episodes seem to have been planned as a single story and flows better than previous seasons even if it was too short.  The plt starts with 9  Minutes and ends with 9  Months.The season opens with another brilliant episode where a period of just over nine minutes in the bar is seen from three different viewpoints.  Each viewpoint explains others while raising its own questions.  It reminds me of Split.Jeff is sadly absent from the season.  He is traveling to the island of Lesbos.  We know of him in the first episode in the form of a phone call.  He appears in the final episode in a dream sequence where he is played by someone else who does a remarkable impression of him.Patrick and Sally have become firmer in their relationship although it will have to go through some rock moments.  The relationship seems to have settled Sally down a little as her insecurities erupt in only one episode.Jane is a free spirit looking for males.  This is where we get Oliver, a rather interesting character who we later learn can actually understand Jane (no simple task).  His relationship with Jane is really one of the highlights of the season.The pregnancy is almost a character in and of itself and anyone who has gone through one will certainly identify with much of this season.  A birthing class gives Steve that chance to perform one of his great rants that is right up there with ""cushions"" and ""men like looking at naked bottoms"" from previous seasons.The only problem with the whole season is that there are only six episodes.  They are great episodes but there are still only six of them.  They all fit on a single DVD while a second DVD includes some interesting extras including deleted scenes and an interview with the new character.",5,Follow the Pregnancy,1108512000,"02 16, 2005",2005,2241,"['reason', 'was', 'unable', 'watch', 'episodes', 'when', 'aired', 'so', 'when', 'bought', 'DVD', 'promptly', 'watched', 'entire', 'season', 'straight', 'can', 'not', 'handle', 'long', 'periods', 'laughing', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'doing', 'this.The', 'season', 'stars', 'shortly', 'end', 'last', 'one', 'Susan', 'pregnant', 'Sally', 'Patrick', 'are', 'together', 'Jane', 'alone', 'never', 'see', 'how', 'breakup', 'priest', 'unfolds', 'season', 'Susan', 'pregnancy', 'end', 'season', 'episodes', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'planned', 'single', 'story', 'better', 'previous', 'seasons', 'even', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'plt', '9', 'Minutes', '9', 'Months.The', 'season', 'brilliant', 'episode', 'where', 'period', 'just', 'nine', 'minutes', 'bar', 'seen', 'three', 'different', 'viewpoints', 'viewpoint', 'others', 'raising', 'own', 'questions', 'Split.Jeff', 'sadly', 'absent', 'season', 'traveling', 'island', 'Lesbos', 'know', 'first', 'episode', 'form', 'phone', 'call', 'final', 'episode', 'dream', 'sequence', 'where', 'played', 'someone', 'else', 'who', 'remarkable', 'impression', 'him.Patrick', 'Sally', 'have', 'become', 'firmer', 'relationship', 'will', 'have', 'go', 'rock', 'moments', 'relationship', 'have', 'settled', 'Sally', 'down', 'little', 'insecurities', 'erupt', 'only', 'one', 'episode.Jane', 'free', 'spirit', 'looking', 'males', 'where', 'get', 'Oliver', 'rather', 'interesting', 'character', 'who', 'later', 'learn', 'can', 'actually', 'understand', 'Jane', 'simple', 'task', 'relationship', 'Jane', 'really', 'one', 'highlights', 'season.The', 'pregnancy', 'almost', 'character', 'anyone', 'who', 'gone', 'one', 'will', 'certainly', 'identify', 'much', 'season', 'birthing', 'class', 'Steve', 'chance', 'perform', 'one', 'great', 'rants', 'right', 'there', 'cushions', 'men', 'looking', 'naked', 'bottoms', 'previous', 'seasons.The', 'only', 'problem', 'whole', 'season', 'are', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'only', 'six', 'fit', 'single', 'DVD', 'second', 'DVD', 'interesting', 'extras', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interview', 'new', 'character']",Coupling - The Complete Fourth Season
861186,A1OBJ2263JCK5,B00065GX8C,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[3, 4]","I have to admit it. I'm a ""Coupling"" freak. This BBC comedy import about the trials and tribulations of the dating & mating rituals of six British singles is a wonderful piece of entertainment. I can watch this series over and over again and still keep finding enjoyment from both the big laughs and the soap opera-ish drama. It dosn't seem to get old no matter how many times I watch it.  Whenever, I come to the end of the final season, I always have just a twinge of sadness. It's seems like the show is being wrapped up, yet it leaves you wanting more.The main story arc of Season 4 (SPOILER ALERT! IF YOU HAVN""T SEEN SEASON 3!!) revolves around Susan's pregnancy. At the very end of Season 3, Susan announced to boyfriend, Steve Taylor ""Times up Steve, I think it's someone else's turn to be a child."" And that pretty much sums up, what Susan and Steve fight about, over the course of six episodes as Steve must get over his fears of impending fatherhood (including dreams of ax welding fetuses) and the emotional commitment that comes along with it.Other storylines include Sally and Patrick's eventual recognition, that they really are ment for each other. The only thing getting in the way is Patrick's long & storied sexual past (well documented and locked away in the cupboard) and Sally's jealousy and lack of self-regard. Meanwhile the insanely self-involved, Jane is introduced to the desperate new guy, Oliver Morris (replacement for the departing Richard Coyle's Jeff). During the course of the season an interesting flirtation begins to grow between these two and actually adds a little depth to Jane's wacky character.There are some wonderful episodes. I love the insanely long and out of control phone call from ""Nightlines"", where the entire cast gets to comment about the various inter-relationships. ""Bedtime"" is also hilarious, while we watch both a literal and figurative game between Sally and Patrick, over where to spend the night. We also get a sequel of sorts, when Jane's eternally perturbed, former psychiatrist raises the ghost of the ""Lesbian Spank Inferno"" in the very funny episode, ""Circus of the Epidurals"". A personal favorite of mine is ""The Naked Living Room"", where Oliver's fear of Jane seeing his flat ""unedited"", leads us to some very sexy (and funny!) scenes.To be perfectly honest, while Season 4 is quite enjoyable, it is a tad sub-par to the preceding three. But thats' like complaining, that your favorite baseball team is only hitting triples, instead of homeruns, everytime it comes up to bat. One problem might be Richard Coyle's sudden departure from the cast. It seems to have upset the show's perfect chemistry. The other problem is in the last episode, where it appears that Series Creator, Steve Moffat is trying to both tie up the storylines with broad stokes, but still leaves some nagging details unanswered. In other words, we are sort of left hanging. Will Sally & Patrick make it as a couple? What's with Jane's mysterious comments about, who she really cares about? And what's with the uncharacteristicly serious tone of Steve's last words about the birth? The last show of the Series leaves us wanting more!Despite these small complaints, ""Coupling"" is still a wonderfully funny show, that will leave you addicted to big laughs.

861187,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B00065GX8C,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[5, 8]","I will buck the trend here and say that Coupling, one of the most truly funny shows on TV in the last fifteen years, flourishes even in the absence of everyone's favorite character, Jeff.  The characters here are changing and developing in a way they really haven't since the first series.  Jeff, unfortunately, isn't free to change, because he would first have to realize how awful he is.  And if he realizes that, he would become self-conscious, and he would stop being funny.It's true that Oliver is a pale shadow of Jeff.  I don't feel the show's creative team gave that character the effort he deserved.  But as the other characters really grow up in a way that they've earned by their dedication to the show for several years, he rides along gamely and lends a hand where he can.As you know if you follow the show, Steve and Susan have a bun in the oven.  Patrick and Sally have just started a relationship.  This leaves Jane without any threads from the previous series, but the creative team picks that up well, forcing her to confront her insecurities and vulnerabilities in a way she's always been happy to slide over in the past.The middle two episodes of this series, ""Bed Time"" and ""Circus of the Epidurals,"" feel like a bridge between the two strong episodes that kick off the series and the two strong ones that wrap it up.  The arc of the series covers the months of Susan's pregnancy, which is a very good length of time for the plot complications that come up.  I would have liked to see Oliver treated with the same gravity that the long-term characters enjoyed, but other than these minor complaints, I think this is a very strong outing.It's unclear whether this is the conclusion of the series.  The final episode opens up several cans of worms, suggesting there could be more and even better to come, though the characters are at a good place where the creative team could call a halt if they want to.  I'm curious about where they're going to go from here.In short, ignore everyone who says that Jeff's departure marks the death of the show.  It remains very much alive, vital, and funny.  And as either a bridge into the next series or as a conclusion in its own right, this DVD is very much worth owning and watching time and time again.",5,Show Survives Even Without Jeff,1134777600,"12 17, 2005",2005,2263,"['will', 'buck', 'trend', 'here', 'say', 'Coupling', 'one', 'most', 'truly', 'funny', 'shows', 'TV', 'last', 'fifteen', 'years', 'flourishes', 'even', 'absence', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'character', 'Jeff', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'changing', 'developing', 'way', 'really', 'have', ""n't"", 'first', 'series', 'Jeff', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'free', 'change', 'would', 'first', 'have', 'realize', 'how', 'awful', 'would', 'become', 'self-conscious', 'would', 'stop', 'being', 'true', 'Oliver', 'pale', 'shadow', 'Jeff', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'show', 'creative', 'team', 'gave', 'character', 'effort', 'deserved', 'other', 'characters', 'really', 'grow', 'up', 'way', ""'ve"", 'earned', 'dedication', 'show', 'several', 'years', 'gamely', 'hand', 'where', 'know', 'follow', 'show', 'Steve', 'Susan', 'have', 'bun', 'oven', 'Patrick', 'Sally', 'have', 'just', 'started', 'relationship', 'Jane', 'threads', 'previous', 'series', 'creative', 'team', 'picks', 'up', 'well', 'forcing', 'confront', 'insecurities', 'vulnerabilities', 'way', 'always', 'been', 'happy', 'slide', 'past.The', 'middle', 'two', 'episodes', 'series', 'Bed', 'Time', 'Circus', 'Epidurals', 'feel', 'bridge', 'two', 'strong', 'episodes', 'kick', 'series', 'two', 'strong', 'ones', 'wrap', 'up', 'arc', 'series', 'months', 'Susan', 'pregnancy', 'very', 'good', 'length', 'time', 'plot', 'complications', 'come', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'Oliver', 'treated', 'same', 'gravity', 'long-term', 'characters', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'minor', 'complaints', 'think', 'very', 'strong', 'outing.It', 'unclear', 'conclusion', 'series', 'final', 'episode', 'up', 'several', 'cans', 'worms', 'suggesting', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'even', 'better', 'come', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'place', 'where', 'creative', 'team', 'could', 'call', 'halt', 'want', ""'m"", 'curious', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'go', 'here.In', 'short', 'ignore', 'everyone', 'who', 'Jeff', 'departure', 'death', 'show', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'vital', 'funny', 'bridge', 'next', 'series', 'conclusion', 'own', 'right', 'DVD', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'owning', 'watching', 'time', 'time', 'again']",Coupling - The Complete Fourth Season

861189,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00065GX8C,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 7]","If you were disappointed when you learned there were only two discs for Series Four of ""Coupling,"" then the news that there are only episodes on the first of those two discs is going to be downright depressing. Given the results I have seen to date I appreciate the British idea of avoiding having a set number of episodes in any given series (read ""season"" on this side of the Pond) because that increases the quality of what we see a lot more than the American model, which is driven towards the goal of having one hundred episodes that usually translate into profitable syndication. But only six episodes to get us through Steve trying to deal with Susan's pregnancy, Sally and Patrick's serious relationship, and Jane's close encounters with Oliver, the new guy, fans have to feel Series 4 comes up short (and that is before we ever come to terms with that new guy replacing Jeff).This series takes us from ""Nine and a Half Minutes"" to ""Nine and a Half Months,"" and since the previous series ended with Susan (Sarah Alexander) announcing she is pregnant it is not surprising that this one ends with the birth of the baby. We have seen writer Steven Moffat play with time and space before (e.g., ""The Girl With Two Breasts"" from Series 1 and ""Split"" from the start of Series 2), and he continues along those lines in these two episodes. ""Nine and a Half Minutes"" gives us the same time frame from the perspective of each couple, while ""Nine and a Half Months"" finds Steve (Jack Davenport) unstuck in time (and having his weirdest dreams ever) as Susan goes into labor.With Susan being pregnant her relationship with Steve is pretty much reduced to his complete and total fear over the miracle of birth. Dragging him to antenatal classes (""Circus of the Epidurals"") is the disaster you would imagine. But overall the best moments for Series 4 come from watching Sally (Kate Isitt) and Patrick (Ben Miles) become closer. The sticking point becomes whether or not Patrick has slept with Jane (Gina Bellman), an issue raised by a late night phone call that does not end until all six characters are on the line (""Night Lines"") and not resolved until the final episode, when Sally actually gets into the infamous cupboard of Patrick's love and finds a box she should not open. In between we get the creative allegory of a knight playing a game of chess with a princess in ""Bed Time.""I agree that the attempt to work Oliver (Richard Mylan) into the mix is problematic. Part of the trouble is how Oliver comes across too much like a poorer version of Jeff (Richard Coyle), who is present in spirit and a bit more (Samantha Spiro) for a couple of episodes. Granted, changing the peculiar mix of characters in this sextet is risky, but they should have come up with more when they came up with Oliver. The other factor here is pairing up Oliver with Jane, which works a bit better because it finally allows her to justifiably be the confident one in the relationship, as amply seen in ""The Naked Living Room."" This certainly suggests some ways of rethinking the Oliver character, but it is obviously a bit too late for that. Like everything else on ""Coupling,"" the story of Oliver and Jane is to be continued.However, I have to think we are getting close to the end of the road for ""Coupling."" This is not because baby Joshua has arrived, but rather because everybody is now paired up on the show (""Friends"" stopped before things got that far). No wonder there were only six episodes in Series 4: once Jane and Oliver hook up nobody is out looking for sex any more. In fact, there is every possibility that ""Coupling"" will no longer be about sex but will actually be spending more time on the subject of love, at which point we should probably turn out the lights because the party will be over.",4,What?

While some were watchable, such as Patrick and Sally in the episode ""Bed Time"" where Patrick is a knight and Sally is a fair maiden, other dream sequences made little sense and didn't have a connection with the plot. For instance, in ""Circus of the Epidurals"" the opening scene had Steve and Susan on a plane with Jane as the flight stewardess as they are about to crash. Patrick then stands up and says, ""Look! I got a whistle! We all have whistles! We are all saved!"" Then everybody on the plane proceeds to blow on their whistles. Moffat gives an unclear explanation as to how there is a connection between a plane crash and Susan preferring a natural child birth over pain relieving epidurals. It just seemed like a desperate attempt to fill in time.Jane's new relationship with Oliver Morris, the science fiction bookshop owner, was a promising storyline in the show. As Patrick and Sally's relationship evolves it can make for a volatile mix: Patrick the himbo together with Sally Harper who is obsessively jealous of Patrick's Cupboard of Love. I have watched the fourth season again and again and never found it to be unwatchable.

The first three seasons were outstanding and I will admit, I did enjoy the fourth season, however, it was no where near the first three seasons.  The six main players fit together so well that is was almost like having your family together at Thanksgiving or Christmas.  The loss of Jeff and the decision to make Susan pregnant was, in my mind a fatal mistake.  When this type of show moves away from the original premise of single men and women having a good time and seek to make the show about a more serious relationship, then what follows is doom.  Did I like the show?  Enough to say that I have watched the first three seasons about 3 or 4 times.  I just recently got the fourth season from Amazon and finished it a few minutes ago.

Well, you'll see most of it here but definitely not Jeff.The reason why Richard Coyle is no longer in the show is unknown to me, and never mentioned in the bonus materials (which by the way include a complete interview with the new guy, Richard Mylan), but the writers obviously tried to justify his absence not succeeding at all. I will be honest and say that Jeff Murdoch was definitely my favorite character of them all, and I don't have anything against the new Oliver character, but listen to his dialogues and you'll see that the writers tried to fit already made Jeff dialogues into his persona, which doesn't help the new character at all.But regardless of the new Oliver character, this season comes as witty and intelligent as it has always been. The first episode for instance shows you the same timeframe (9 1/2 minutes) from three different points of view that fit together in the end, total genius!`Nightlines' and the never ending phone call will give you a good laugh, the game of coupling in the third episode is just amazing and the highlight is definitely episode 6 (9  months) with a retuned Jeff that totally lets you down, put aside that and the rest of the episode will make you cry (Steve definitely draws all attention here)I usually give 5 stars to the show but being the current Oliver-Jeff situation this won't be the time.

I predict that this show will be remembered as hilarious twenty years from now!  As for Season 4, I have some mixed feelings.It is interesting to see the five returning characters evolve into relatively stable people.  Its only natural when we see Jane finally getting over Steve and Patrick and Sally making a go of it that we find ourselves pulling for them.  The problem with that is, as the show and its characters mature, its becoming less funny.  It happens to a lot of comedies (think M*A*S*H*).  So I don't know if Coupling has run its course or not, but if it has not it will be a challenge for Mr. Moffatt to breathe new hilarity into this cast.Now for Oliver.  Quirky characters are not new to this series.  At times Jeff, Jane, and Sally have all been way over the top and with great results.  With Oliver however, you find yourself almost embarrassed for him at times.  Where Jeff seemed to be able to deliver the crazy lines and still be funny, the Oliver character doesn't seem as able to pull it off...I hate to say that ""Jeff"" departing has ruined Coupling, but it was definitely a damaging blow.  Overall, Season 4 is still worth watching, but in my opinion it is the least funny of all and makes me wonder about the future of the show.If you have seen the first three seasons, then this is a must buy.

861202,A2I29YY8T7PVLZ,B00065GX8C,the_frog,"[5, 8]","I will pass on the traditional episode-by-episode description and instead address the central issue in this entire discussion, one that has chased the series since the news of Richard Coyle's quitting: What will this series be without Jeff Murdock?Well, the short answer is very funny and much more meaningful. The ongoing arc of the four series of Coupling has been the growth of each character from their initial short brief into a fully realized person. While the first series featured the first inklings of Susan and Steve as people, it was really the growth of Sally and, to a considerably lesser extent, Patrick over the course of the second and third series that helped bring audiences in and enjoy a tremendous amount of laughter. Which left us with Jane and Jeff, whose abortive relationships of the third series began to teach us about them.Well, Jeff left and so we have Jane. Given her on-her-own-planet nature from the first series, this would be a challenge. And Moffat chooses the same vehicle as he did for Sally and Patrick: love. But realizing the limitations of the third series when she began a relationship with a secondary character, Moffat wisely decides to kill two birds with one stone by making Jeff's replacement Jane's love interest. Thematically, it is a great decision, because it really allows Gina Bellman to act, well, human, and devote the appropriate amount of time to this. In this way, I think Coupling has gained tremendously with Jeff's departure, in allowing the development of real emotional depth and using less farce as they did earlier in the show with Jeff's ravings.But, it's a comedy, so we have to go back to the real question: is it funny? Absolutely. However, I always consider ""Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps"" of Season 3 to be the funniest half hour I have ever seen, and this series does not meet up to that high level. Secondly, my above paragraph and thematic elements notwithstanding, Jeff WAS incredibly funny, and his interludes, which were always extremely welcome breaks from Moffat's intricate plots, are missed, simply because of Coyle's amrvelous comic prescence, which Oliver does not replace, nor does he especially try to.Coupling's fourth series is a rich and worthy addition to the history of the series, and any owner of the previous series would be making an error ignoring this one.
