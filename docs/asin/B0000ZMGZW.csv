It is the story of how a girl follows a timeline suggested by her mom just before her death. This timeline includes a number of activities such as college, a job and boyfriends. The setup arises from the fact that the mother said she would marry her 7th boyfriend but it turns out the guy she meets after dumping #5 seems like the one for her. So she agrees to spend a weekend accompanying a guy from the local bagel shop to his friend's wedding so that she can justify him being boyfriend #6. While the setup seems a little tacky, it is actually done in a fairly restrained manner and it works for the movie. There are a lot of interesting characters in the film and some of them have good chemistry when interacting. I'm not crazy about the casting for the female lead character, but she does well enough that it works in the movie and she does seem to work well with the male lead characters. In the end, the romantic aspect of the film ends up being fairly standard fare but for me, it was executed well enough to be pleasant to watch.

The story starts out with Amy Meyer, (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) at age seven with her dying mother making a timeline for Amy's life. Amy takes the timeline and follows through with everything on it, right down to her mother's prediction that she will have six boyfriends and that number seven will be ""the one."" The trouble is, Amy finds who she thinks is Mr. Right is Daniel (Brad Rowe) who is only number six! So Amy must find a substitute boyfriend to stand in as number six so Daniel will be her seventh boyfriend. Talk about confusing!!! Amy gets Peter, (Patrick Dempsey) her ""bagel man"", to play the part of boyfriend number six, only to find herself falling for Peter. Now, with her heart being pulled in both directions, she must make a decision that will change the course of her life forever. Peter tries to convince Amy to let go of the timeline and just do what her heart truly desires. Daniel just wants her to focus on her career as a lawyer. The movie leaves to wandering until the very end, which one she will choose. This movie is also the ultimate Romantic Comedy!

It seemed like she was a little girl in a toy store trying to figure out which boy toy she liked best and wanted to take home with her.  It wasn't even the fact that the story was disgustingly predictable; it was the story line itself as well as the acting.  I liked the whole idea of her mother mapping out her love life, but the way it was unrolled in the movie was horrible.  I feel like the writers were so in a rush to finish the movie that they just flew through it tossing in ""dramatic"" situations just to get to the end.

790300,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0000ZMGZW,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","For me, the crush was on as soon as I saw Kimberly Williams (now Willliams-Paisley) inFather of the Bride (15th Anniversary Edition). Kimberly Williams-Paisley hasn't really done a lot of films in her career, so it's tough luck for her fans looking to see more of her cinematically. There's the sequel to FATHER OF THE BRIDE, of course, and a 2001 made-for-TV movie,Follow The Stars Home, which I quite liked - and then this one, LUCKY 7, which came out in 2003, also a made-for-TV movie and one which I like even more. As a bonus, the DVD even comes with a seven-minute-long Making Of segment.When 7-year-old Amy Myer's dying mother, playfully and on a whim, jotted down a timeline list for Amy, she unwittingly mapped out her daughter's life. Slavishly adhering to the timeline, Amy had gone to summer camp, holidayed abroad, become a lawyer, and had kept count of her romantic relationships. Her mother's guideline had indicated that her seventh boyfriend, that lucky seven, would be the one, the real thing. The story proper opens with Amy, now in her twenties, having just broken up with Boyfriend #5 (dumb dude cheated on her). But then she meets Daniel, who is successful, charming, looks like Brad Pitt's younger brother. Fireworks even go off when they kiss for the first time. Her friends think him perfect; her dad even gives him his seal of approval. And Daniel really likes her. But Amy starts tripping because Daniel is only number six, which, in her mom's guideline, makes him diddly-do-squat.She decides to have an interim boyfriend and takes up Peter the local bagel shop owner's invite of a weekend out-of-town non-date to his friend's wedding. Or as Amy tells her father: ""I'm trying to turn Peter into number six so that Daniel can be number seven."" And because this is a movie redolent with an air of gentle wackiness, Amy finds out that she's not the only one indulging in a pretend relationship. Peter had already told his friends that Amy was his girlfriend. And, maybe for the first time in her life of regimented and neurotic non-spontaneity, Amy decides to go with the flow...All you soft touches for romance should probably line up for this one. LUCKY 7 is a terrific romantic comedy, featuring very nice chemistry by its two leads, Kimberly Williams-Paisley and Patrick Dempsey. The story isn't about to shock anyone with outrageous twists and turns; we know how it ends. I do like that, initially, Patrick Dempsey's part isn't strongly featured, he's more of a background character. It isn't until the weekend getaway that his backstory really gets fleshed out. Dempsey oozes unpretentious, regular guy charm in this one, and probably there's some leftover cred I'm giving him from his days inCan't Buy Me Love, one of my favorite alltime teen flicks of the '80s (dude is also good inEnchanted (Widescreen Edition)).Kimberly Williams-Paisley makes it look effortless, doing it with warmth and natural appeal and good acting (and she's also very cute). She juggles her character's neuroses without ever getting annoying, and she very easily makes Amy likeable. I think she's an underrated light comedienne; she's absolutely perfect for this sort of romantic comedy roles.LUCKY 7 is more or less an askewed fairy tale, and of destiny being gently thwarted. It's also a coming-to-grips story and maybe even a coming-of-age story, because Amy, although now an adult, is still very much holding on to her long departed mother. A crack finally begins to surface when we learn (as Amy confesses to Peter) that she really loathes her lawyer job. LUCKY 7 is very romantic, and I dug all the beats, from those hands fitting perfectly to those moments in which you see Peter yearning for Amy, to the dilemma of number six possibly turning out to be the one and so turning the timeline topsy-turvy. The ""How to make crab cakes"" lesson, though, is just a wee bit disgusting (and yet I laughed). The supporting cast is very good, consisting mostly of Amy's understanding dad and Amy and Peter's respective bunch of friends. I also appreciate that the screenplay writer didn't do the dirty by making the romantic third wheel an unsavory jerk. Because when Amy finally does pick her lucky seventh guy, it shouldn't come off as so easy and obvious a choice.

Thank you to all those who recommended it, because it's now one of my most watched movies.It isn't a classic, by any means, and the plot and characters aren't revolutionary, but in that way it's like a favorite sweater, comfortable and fluffy warm, because what it does it does very well.  Using the neat hook of a woman rigidly following the timeline drawn out for her as a child by her dying mother, romantic complications arise when Amy, now a stressed lawyer and up to boyfriend #6 according to the plan, meets a handsome new man she wants to be #7- the true-love-marriage man.  In order to make this so, Amy needs a stand-in for #6 and she finds this in Peter, her local bagel pusher, who is quietly a wee bit smitten with the unwitting Amy.This romantic triangle is kicked up a notch when Amy accompanies Peter to a friend's wedding on beautiful Orcas Island and the weekend trip is the focus and highlight of the film, as Amy and Peter get to know each other better and struggle to keep up their pretence of being a couple as their emotions get tangled in the ruse and the rules that have governed Amy's life.  As happens in all good romantic triangles, it all comes down to the choice between Cute Nice Guy #1 and Cute Nice Guy #2.However, to boil it down to that is to sell the film- and the actors- short.  Kimberley Williams makes Amy bright and bubbly and her character carries the film winningly, while as her suitors, Brad Rowe as the potential ""lucky 7"" is definitely easy on the eye (if not terribly charismatic) and Patrick Dempsey has such a great easy charm mixed with a hint of smoulder that his bagel-boy Peter won me over early on and made *my* choice easy.  In addition to the genuinely likable characters- including the supporting roles of Amy's father and friends- this film is treat to watch for the gorgeous scenery of Orcas Island and the soundtrack which uses songs by Chantal Kreviazuk and eastmountainsouth to wonderful effect.It's the kind of sweet, light movie treat that begs for a quiet night, a good comfy sofa, a dish of ice cream or a bowl of buttery popcorn, and maybe a couple of friends to sigh and smile over it all with you.

The plot is pretty cheesy because William's character is superstitious (she believes her 7th boyfriend will be the one she marries and lives happily ever after with) and a bit flaky.The plot is rather cheesy too because she manipulates her relationships so that the guy she's interested in - who would be #6 - will be the seventh one she gets to marry.  So she begins a false relationship with a sweet guy who's in love with her and desperate for a wedding date, so that he can be #6 and she can then marry the hoped for #7.  Naturally things get all mixed up and she ends up falling for #6, but only after she hurts him terribly.  So I feel sorry for the guy and angry at the girl for hurting him, but it all turns out ok in the end.I originally saw this on ABC Family Channel (around Valentines Day I think) so you may want to see if you can catch it on there sometime before purchasing.",3,"Kimberly Williams is fun to watch, but overall this movie is kind of shallow and cheesy....",1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,997,"['Kimberly', 'Williams', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'make', 'cute', 'pair', 'movie', 'main', 'reason', 'watch', 'plot', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'William', 'character', 'superstitious', '7th', 'boyfriend', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'happily', 'ever', 'bit', 'flaky.The', 'plot', 'rather', 'cheesy', 'too', 'relationships', 'guy', 'interested', 'who', 'would', 'be', '6', 'will', 'be', 'seventh', 'one', 'marry', 'false', 'relationship', 'sweet', 'guy', 'who', 'love', 'desperate', 'wedding', 'date', 'so', 'can', 'be', '6', 'can', 'then', 'marry', 'hoped', '7', 'Naturally', 'things', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'up', 'falling', '6', 'only', 'terribly', 'feel', 'sorry', 'guy', 'angry', 'girl', 'hurting', 'out', 'ok', 'end.I', 'originally', 'saw', 'ABC', 'Family', 'Channel', 'Valentines', 'Day', 'think', 'may', 'want', 'see', 'can', 'catch', 'sometime', 'purchasing']",Lucky Seven

790322,A6T8U57FYPXEW,B0000ZMGZW,"Sidpayton ""lover of movies and music""","[46, 47]","This is an original ABC Family Movie which first aired on network TV in July 2003 and, thanks to an enormous following and fan request, this wonderful movie will soon be available for purchase on DVD.  Amy (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) was seven years old when her mother died.  Before her Mom died, she left Amy a timeline to remember her by and to help her cope with her passing.  The timeline included pivotal times of a young girl growing up, college, career, etc., leading up to finding her soulmate.  Her Mom told her that lucky number 7 would be her true love.  Enter number 6, Daniel, played by Brad Rowe, a meticulous, organized, career oriented handsome young man with whom Amy falls in love.  Daniel seems to be the perfect match--Amy is also meticulous, organized, and career oriented and hopes to make partner in her law firm.  However, Daniel is number 6.  Before Amy gets in too deep, she concocts a plan to make Daniel number 7 by inserting another guy, Peter, played by the luscious Patrick Dempsey, into the number 6 slot.  Peter is a sweet, very cute and good natured guy who manages a bagel store (but there is much more to Peter than meets the eye).  He asks Amy to go to a friend's wedding for the weekend and she agrees to do so, with the intention of making him number 6, so that when she gets back home, she will pick up with Daniel where they left off.  Peter asks her to pretend that she is his girlfriend because his ex-fiancee will be at the wedding and he does not want his friends to think he is still suffering.  Neither one of them anticipate the feelings that they will have for each other.  The next 45 minutes of the movie are my favorite due to the onscreen chemistry between Kimberly and Patrick.  I must say that Patrick Dempsey has grown from a young skinny kid into a most handsome and charismatic man at age 37. I am truly smitten, and would love to see more of him on the big screen.  Although the premise of the movie is farfetched, the story works because of the excellent performances of the cast and the chemistry between Kimberly and Patrick.  Another plus is an incredible soundtrack.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys romance, great acting and good music.
