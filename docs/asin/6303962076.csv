392892,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6303962076,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Jakobowsky und der Oberst / Me and the Colonel, 1958 filmThis was adapted from a Broadway play from the early 1940s. Can the war in Europe be used as the background for comedy? It is set in Paris. Colonel Tadeusz Prakozhny wants to escape the Nazi invasion. Mr. Jakubowsky, a resourceful man, also wants to escape (he has fled from other countries earlier). The humor comes from the contrast between two persons: a strong military man and a smart civilian named Samuel Jakubowsky. Both are from the town of Boradinko (one is the son of a landowner, the other a teacher). The Colonel is bigoted aristocrat, Jakubowsky is a Jew. When a country is invaded all must work together. Jakubowsky obtains an automobile to travel to neutral Spain, but the Colonel wants to meet his Lady Love. [Are the characters stereotypes? Note the differences from earlier movies from the 1940s. Are the characters believable?]The Colonel travels to a restaurant to meet his wife. A German Major visits this inn as well! Then a French tank arrives on the road. Can Jakubowsky turn vodka into gasoline? Yes, if he is resourceful. They find refuge in a castle. Jakubowsky is ""a genius"" for this scheme. The Colonel is upset at this! His lady friend recognizes Sam's intelligence. Is that thunder in the distance? The Colonel insists on a duel. But it ends in the cellar near a cask of wine. There are new visitors, they requisition the castle for German soldiers. Jakubowsky and the Colonel must leave again. A roadblock stops them and takes them to that German Major (who is looking for Colonel Prakozhny). ""He is my cousin."" ""There is no accounting for taste."" The Major decides to release them and provide transport. Colonel Prakozhny was speechless.[Do their characters seem consistent?] Jakubowsky walks away; later a car gives him a ride to a town. Two soldiers bring him to an office for questioning about the Colonel. The Germans want to stop Prakozhny before he leaves for England. Two men follow Jakubowsky to see where he goes. The French Resistance warns the Colonel. Jakubowsky sits in the town square. The Colonel joins him (he knows he is being watched). ""Every good soldier has a counter-strategy."" A Staff Officer devises strategy. The Gestapo watched them walk away and follows them to a convent. Their car is followed when it leaves. ""Something is wrong!"" A bicycle brings Jakubowsky and the Colonel to the beach so he and the Colonel and his lady friend can travel to England in a submarine. There is only room for two in this boat. ""Come back soon!"" Who has those papers?Danny Kaye was better known for his comedy roles. Curt Jurgens plays the Colonel. Two possibilities are: you either love or hate this story. This mixes drama and comedy in a tragic situation that isn't believable. A Colonel who is important would not have to leave the country on his own at this time of the war; the story seems implausible to me. Would an important office drink so much as to incapacitate himself? Note the underplayed Gestapo official ""a technician who gets people to talk"". This story seems outdated by the 1950s. There are better World War II stories made during this time.",2,There are Two Possibilities,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,3161,"['Jakobowsky', 'und', 'der', 'Oberst', '/', 'Me', 'Colonel', '1958', 'filmThis', 'was', 'adapted', 'Broadway', 'play', 'early', '1940s', 'Can', 'war', 'Europe', 'be', 'used', 'background', 'comedy', 'set', 'Paris', 'Colonel', 'Tadeusz', 'Prakozhny', 'escape', 'Nazi', 'invasion', 'Mr.', 'Jakubowsky', 'resourceful', 'man', 'also', 'escape', 'fled', 'other', 'countries', 'earlier', 'humor', 'contrast', 'two', 'persons', 'strong', 'military', 'man', 'smart', 'civilian', 'named', 'Samuel', 'Jakubowsky', 'are', 'town', 'Boradinko', 'one', 'son', 'landowner', 'other', 'teacher', 'Colonel', 'bigoted', 'aristocrat', 'Jakubowsky', 'Jew', 'When', 'country', 'invaded', 'must', 'work', 'together', 'Jakubowsky', 'automobile', 'travel', 'neutral', 'Spain', 'Colonel', 'meet', 'Lady', 'Love', '[', 'Are', 'characters', 'stereotypes', 'Note', 'differences', 'earlier', 'movies', '1940s', 'Are', 'characters', 'believable', ']', 'Colonel', 'travels', 'restaurant', 'meet', 'wife', 'German', 'Major', 'visits', 'inn', 'as', 'well', 'Then', 'French', 'tank', 'road', 'Can', 'Jakubowsky', 'turn', 'vodka', 'gasoline', 'Yes', 'resourceful', 'find', 'refuge', 'castle', 'Jakubowsky', 'genius', 'scheme', 'Colonel', 'upset', 'lady', 'friend', 'Sam', 'intelligence', 'thunder', 'distance', 'Colonel', 'duel', 'cellar', 'cask', 'wine', 'are', 'new', 'visitors', 'requisition', 'castle', 'German', 'soldiers', 'Jakubowsky', 'Colonel', 'must', 'leave', 'again', 'roadblock', 'German', 'Major', 'who', 'looking', 'Colonel', 'Prakozhny', 'cousin', 'accounting', 'taste', 'Major', 'release', 'provide', 'transport', 'Colonel', 'Prakozhny', 'was', 'speechless', '[', 'Do', 'characters', 'seem', 'consistent', ']', 'Jakubowsky', 'away', 'later', 'car', 'ride', 'town', 'Two', 'soldiers', 'bring', 'office', 'questioning', 'Colonel', 'Germans', 'want', 'stop', 'Prakozhny', 'England', 'Two', 'men', 'follow', 'Jakubowsky', 'see', 'where', 'French', 'Resistance', 'Colonel', 'Jakubowsky', 'town', 'square', 'Colonel', 'being', 'watched', 'good', 'soldier', 'counter-strategy', 'Staff', 'Officer', 'strategy', 'Gestapo', 'watched', 'walk', 'away', 'convent', 'car', 'followed', 'when', 'Something', 'wrong', 'bicycle', 'Jakubowsky', 'Colonel', 'beach', 'Colonel', 'lady', 'friend', 'can', 'travel', 'England', 'submarine', 'only', 'room', 'two', 'boat', 'Come', 'back', 'soon', 'Who', 'papers', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'was', 'better', 'known', 'comedy', 'roles', 'Curt', 'Jurgens', 'Colonel', 'Two', 'possibilities', 'are', 'love', 'hate', 'story', 'mixes', 'drama', 'comedy', 'tragic', 'situation', ""n't"", 'believable', 'Colonel', 'who', 'important', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'leave', 'country', 'own', 'time', 'war', 'story', 'implausible', 'Would', 'important', 'office', 'drink', 'so', 'much', 'incapacitate', 'Note', 'underplayed', 'Gestapo', 'official', 'technician', 'who', 'people', 'talk', 'story', 'outdated', '1950s', 'are', 'better', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'stories', 'made', 'time']",Me & The Colonel VHS
392893,A1KVSBMU1R4GVU,6303962076,Alicia Adams,"[1, 1]","This movie isn't like any other Danny Kaye film I've ever seen.  No funny songs and tongue twisters, no comic fantasy - just the story of a clever Jewish man finding his way out of France at the beginning of World War II, and the Polish colonel who reluctantly travels with them.  The interaction between the two very different men provides a lot of the drama of the story.  The Danny Kaye character is a very practical survivor; the colonel an idealistic would-be hero who, as his traveling companion disgustedly remarks, comes straight out of the 12th century.  Things only get more complicated between them when the colonel ""goes the wrong direction"" and picks up a beautiful woman that he intends to take out of France with him.  From their first meeting, there is an attraction between the woman and Danny Kaye's character.  The colonel doesn't handle this well, to say the least.  Yet with time, as they face dangers together, the two men learn to like and respect one another.  In the end, they escape together and leave the girl behind - a very unusual ending, especially for the times.",5,Danny Kaye in an unusual role - spoiler alert,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,1094,"['movie', ""n't"", 'like', 'other', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'funny', 'songs', 'tongue', 'twisters', 'comic', 'fantasy', 'just', 'story', 'clever', 'Jewish', 'man', 'finding', 'way', 'France', 'beginning', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Polish', 'colonel', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'interaction', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'men', 'lot', 'drama', 'story', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'character', 'very', 'practical', 'survivor', 'colonel', 'idealistic', 'would-be', 'hero', 'who', 'traveling', 'companion', 'disgustedly', 'remarks', 'straight', '12th', 'century', 'only', 'get', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'colonel', 'wrong', 'direction', 'up', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'take', 'out', 'France', 'first', 'meeting', 'attraction', 'woman', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'character', 'colonel', ""n't"", 'handle', 'well', 'say', 'least', 'time', 'face', 'dangers', 'together', 'two', 'men', 'learn', 'like', 'respect', 'one', 'end', 'escape', 'together', 'leave', 'girl', 'very', 'unusual', 'ending', 'especially', 'times']",Me & The Colonel VHS

When its title was found while searching amongst Danny's films I remembered the story as if it was yesterday. I immediately purchased a copy to show my family, and my son watched it a second time immediately.As a Jew in France during the Nazi period, Danny's Jacobowsky is in very great danger, out of necessity he teams with a Polish colonel to leave France. The ""HOW"" of this is humorous(!) and heart-warming. The Jurgens' Colonel and Kay's Jacobowsky compliment each other wonderfully; one is brave the other not, one is clever the other not, one is handsome the other not, one is sensible the other not, etc.You'll smile time after time throughout the movie!",5,Wanna smile with a warm feeling?,1012176000,"01 28, 2002",2002,723,"['never', 'forgot', 'movie', 'having', 'seen', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'When', 'title', 'was', 'found', 'searching', 'amongst', 'Danny', 'films', 'remembered', 'story', 'was', 'yesterday', 'immediately', 'purchased', 'copy', 'show', 'family', 'son', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'Jew', 'France', 'Nazi', 'period', 'Danny', 'Jacobowsky', 'very', 'great', 'danger', 'necessity', 'Polish', 'colonel', 'leave', 'France', 'HOW', 'humorous', 'heart-warming', 'Jurgens', 'Colonel', 'Kay', 'Jacobowsky', 'compliment', 'other', 'wonderfully', 'one', 'brave', 'other', 'not', 'one', 'clever', 'other', 'not', 'one', 'handsome', 'other', 'not', 'one', 'sensible', 'other', 'not', 'etc.You', ""'ll"", 'smile', 'time', 'time', 'movie']",Me & The Colonel VHS
392895,A387BD735MI50R,6303962076,R. Schultz,"[9, 9]","This is a gem of a movie, unfortunately largely overlooked. I think Danny Kaye gives his best performance here, in a long career of wonderful performances. And the plot offers something for almost everyone, without in the least being a pandering smear of action.Men to whom I recommended this film liked it for its recreation of conditions in World War II France. The tanks, the Germans sweeping in to occupy, the grim choice faced by the local residents of the occupied towns - to cope, to conciliate, or to combat.All the women to whom I've recommended this film liked the romance. With its hint of the possibility of polyandry to come, this movie was ahead of its time, without stooping to the crasser implications of the modern meaning of  ""a threesome.""I have also recommended this movie to anyone involved in any 12-step program or any program designed to overcome phobias. Faced with a tough situation, Danny Kaye reminds himself of his motto, ""There are always two possibilities."" He doesn't allow himself to get boxed in. A motivational speaker could endlessly recite this philosophy to anyone suffering from agoraphobia or social phobia. But that wouldn't have the impact of actually seeing Danny Kaye put his motto into play in such an engaging way.I suppose a hyper-politically correct person might find a grain of stereotyping here. Kurt Jurgens, also in what I consider to be his best performance, plays a Polish officer - big, bluff, and yes, a little ""dumb."" And Danny Kaye plays a Jewish refugee who is, yes, rather ""resourceful,"" and who relies on this resourcefulness to get him through. However I don't think anyone could ultimately object to this mote of stereotyping, because overall, both Kaye and Jurgens prove themselves to be such winning, incomparable individuals - they transcend any attempts to fit them into a mold.This is a must-see movie. It will lighten your heart. It will leave you feeling more hopeful - about humanity and about your own future. After watching it, you too will realize that, even confronted by the most dire circumstances, you always have at least ""two possibilities.""",5,Wise and Winning!,1155686400,"08 16, 2006",2006,2121,"['gem', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'largely', 'overlooked', 'think', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'best', 'performance', 'here', 'long', 'career', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'plot', 'something', 'almost', 'everyone', 'least', 'being', 'pandering', 'smear', 'action.Men', 'whom', 'recommended', 'film', 'liked', 'recreation', 'conditions', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'France', 'tanks', 'Germans', 'sweeping', 'occupy', 'grim', 'choice', 'faced', 'local', 'residents', 'occupied', 'towns', 'cope', 'conciliate', 'combat.All', 'women', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'recommended', 'film', 'liked', 'romance', 'hint', 'possibility', 'polyandry', 'come', 'movie', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'stooping', 'crasser', 'implications', 'modern', 'meaning', 'threesome', 'have', 'also', 'recommended', 'movie', 'anyone', 'involved', '12-step', 'program', 'program', 'designed', 'overcome', 'phobias', 'Faced', 'tough', 'situation', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'motto', 'are', 'always', 'two', 'possibilities', ""n't"", 'allow', 'get', 'boxed', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'could', 'endlessly', 'recite', 'philosophy', 'anyone', 'suffering', 'agoraphobia', 'social', 'phobia', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'impact', 'actually', 'seeing', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'put', 'motto', 'play', 'such', 'engaging', 'way.I', 'suppose', 'hyper-politically', 'correct', 'person', 'might', 'find', 'grain', 'stereotyping', 'here', 'Kurt', 'Jurgens', 'also', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'best', 'performance', 'Polish', 'officer', 'big', 'bluff', 'yes', 'little', 'dumb', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'Jewish', 'refugee', 'who', 'yes', 'rather', 'resourceful', 'who', 'resourcefulness', 'get', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'could', 'ultimately', 'object', 'mote', 'stereotyping', 'overall', 'Kaye', 'Jurgens', 'prove', 'be', 'such', 'winning', 'incomparable', 'individuals', 'transcend', 'attempts', 'fit', 'mold.This', 'must-see', 'movie', 'will', 'lighten', 'heart', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'more', 'hopeful', 'humanity', 'own', 'future', 'watching', 'too', 'will', 'realize', 'even', 'confronted', 'most', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'always', 'have', 'least', 'two', 'possibilities']",Me & The Colonel VHS
