Orion edition - the first release of the film, it was in a snapper case by Orion Pictures.  It's been Out of Print for quite some time.2. MGM first edition - essentially the Orion disc, but in the first MGM case (with the blue sky background and the snapshot of T&L;)3. MGM Special Edition (with slipcover) - a flipper disc with the special features, the slipcover is different from the regular cover art.4. MGM Special Edition (without slipcover) - same as #3, sans slipcover.  It's still a flipper disc.5. MGM standard edition - Essentially the first MGM edition, except with the new transfer used on the special edition, and it's not a flipper (so you don't get the documentaries, trailers, music video, or storyboards).  The coverart is exactly like the MGM special edition (without slipcover), though there is no ""Special Edition"" banner.MGM's DVD factories or wherever they make their DVDs sometimes mess up and put the Special Edition cover art in cases with the standard edition.To always make sure you get the actual special edition, make sure it comes with the cardboard slipcover.  Because 9 times out of 10, if you pick up one that says Special Edition and it's a single-sided disc, you got the standard edition with the wrong cover art.I got burned at Sears when I purchased Thelma and Louise: Special Edition, and discovered to my horror it was the standard edition.

303896,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302250269,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Ridley Scott has had a good run of things.  Sure, he's not done, but looking back at his career he could easily retire happy with what he's produced.  He's basically created a cultural landmark for each decade.  Between `Alien' (1979), `Blade Runner' (1982), `Thelma and Louise' (1991) and `Gladiator' (2000) he's established himself as a director full of range and talent and sustainability.  I have the utmost faith that his upcoming `The Counselor' will prove his talents once again (what a cast, what a story!) and cement his efforts for the next decade of film.For me, `Thelma and Louise' could possibly be his finest film.  I have a very soft spot in my heart for this beautiful movie, thanks in large part to everyone involved and the depth of passion they poured into this project.  There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best film of 1991, and that year was astounding (`BEAUTY AND THE BEAST'!!!) so that is saying a lot.`Thelma and Louise' tells the story of two best friends aptly named Thelma and Louise.  These two women, iconic thanks to the flawless way in which their characters are developed by both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, are victims of a society that takes advantage of them.  Thelma is being suffocated by her controlling husband, and Louise is a sassy waitress who is desperate to help Thelma break free and breathe some fresh air so-to-speak.  What starts out as a harmless road-trip turns into a panic when a man tries to force himself on Thelma, and Louise is forced to take matters into her own hands.  Now, on the run and paranoid of being found, these two women build on their strong bond as they realize all they have in the world is each other.Ridley directs this film with such finesse, allowing these two characters to really shine.  He builds a film around two of the most interesting characters and give the audience a reason to be drawn to them.  But really, the star of this show is Susan Sarandon.  Wait, the star of this show is Geena Davis.  WAIT!  Seriously, these two women are so in tune with one another it's ridiculous.  There are many films that rely on co-leads to carry them and there is usually one particular standout who steals the bulk of the attention.  That isn't really so here.  For me, Sarandon and Davis make the perfect Yin and Yang.  Their differences only help to balance out the whole in creating such a refreshing take on the buddy film, because they complete one another in ways that I haven't seen before.  Sarandon's breed of `no-nonsense' aggressor is perfectly balanced out by Davis's nave sensuality.  Her flirtatious innocence plays devil's advocate to Sarandon's intense `all knowing' persona.  They draw off one another and push the envelope in such marvelous ways.If ever the Academy should have had a tie in Best Actress, it was 1991 (but alas, they went with that Foster woman instead).With a strong supporting cast that includes a breakout performance from Brad Pitt and a beautifully sincere performance from Harvey Keitel, Ridley Scott's masterpiece is one for the ages.  It touches upon such deeply moving themes as friendship and love and it manages to stick with you for all times.  I can still feel the chills I felt the very first time I saw this film; those tears still staining my cheek to this very day.",5,Magnum opus if I ever saw one!,1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,3303,"['Ridley', 'Scott', 'had', 'good', 'run', 'things', 'Sure', 'not', 'done', 'looking', 'back', 'career', 'could', 'easily', 'retire', 'happy', 'what', 'produced', 'basically', 'created', 'cultural', 'landmark', 'decade', 'Between', 'Alien', '1979', 'Blade', 'Runner', '1982', 'Thelma', 'Louise', '1991', 'Gladiator', '2000', 'established', 'director', 'full', 'range', 'talent', 'sustainability', 'have', 'utmost', 'faith', 'upcoming', 'Counselor', 'will', 'prove', 'talents', 'once', 'again', 'what', 'cast', 'what', 'story', 'cement', 'efforts', 'next', 'decade', 'film.For', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'finest', 'film', 'have', 'very', 'soft', 'spot', 'heart', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'everyone', 'involved', 'depth', 'passion', 'poured', 'project', 'doubt', 'mind', 'best', 'film', '1991', 'year', 'was', 'astounding', 'BEAUTY', 'THE', 'BEAST', 'saying', 'lot.', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'story', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'aptly', 'named', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'two', 'women', 'iconic', 'thanks', 'flawless', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'developed', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'are', 'victims', 'society', 'advantage', 'Thelma', 'being', 'suffocated', 'controlling', 'husband', 'Louise', 'sassy', 'waitress', 'who', 'desperate', 'help', 'Thelma', 'break', 'free', 'breathe', 'fresh', 'air', 'so-to-speak', 'What', 'out', 'harmless', 'road-trip', 'panic', 'when', 'man', 'force', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'forced', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'Now', 'run', 'paranoid', 'being', 'found', 'two', 'women', 'build', 'strong', 'bond', 'realize', 'have', 'world', 'other.Ridley', 'film', 'such', 'finesse', 'allowing', 'two', 'characters', 'really', 'shine', 'film', 'two', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'give', 'audience', 'reason', 'be', 'drawn', 'really', 'star', 'show', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Wait', 'star', 'show', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'WAIT', 'Seriously', 'two', 'women', 'are', 'so', 'tune', 'one', 'ridiculous', 'are', 'many', 'films', 'rely', 'co-leads', 'carry', 'usually', 'one', 'particular', 'standout', 'who', 'bulk', 'attention', ""n't"", 'really', 'so', 'here', 'Sarandon', 'Davis', 'make', 'perfect', 'Yin', 'Yang', 'differences', 'only', 'help', 'balance', 'out', 'whole', 'creating', 'refreshing', 'take', 'buddy', 'film', 'complete', 'one', 'ways', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'Sarandon', 'breed', 'no-nonsense', 'aggressor', 'perfectly', 'balanced', 'out', 'Davis', 'nave', 'sensuality', 'flirtatious', 'innocence', 'devil', 'advocate', 'Sarandon', 'intense', 'knowing', 'persona', 'draw', 'off', 'one', 'push', 'envelope', 'such', 'marvelous', 'ways.If', 'ever', 'Academy', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'tie', 'Best', 'Actress', 'was', '1991', 'alas', 'went', 'Foster', 'woman', 'instead', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'breakout', 'performance', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'beautifully', 'sincere', 'performance', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'ages', 'such', 'deeply', 'moving', 'themes', 'friendship', 'love', 'stick', 'times', 'can', 'still', 'feel', 'chills', 'felt', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'tears', 'still', 'staining', 'cheek', 'very', 'day']",N/A

They are backed by a solid supporting cast including Michael Madsen and the incomparable Harvey Keitel, as well as early breakthrough role by Brad Pitt.The plot could've also been one dimensional and uninteresting, but writer Callie Khouri again made ot sparkle with inventive sequences, a solid mix of action, laughter and drama, and crackling dialogue.And the direction by cinematic auteur Ridley Scott is audacious.

Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are nothing short than perfect as Thelma &amp; Louise, both creating equally likable and complex  characters. Considered to be a female buddy road-trip movie, but this film  is much, much more, mainly because of the excellent multi-layered  screenplay. Ridley Scott directed an instant American classic. Some scenes  are now considered classics, such as the ending. The 'male' part of the  cast are all excellent, Harvey Keitel and Michael Madsen are great.

This Oscar-winning film takes audiences on a journey into a road trip that takes an unplanned turn.  Once Thelma (Geena Davis) has a close encounter with a rapist, their lives change forever.  After Louise (Susan Sarandon) kills the rapist, the action starts and never stops until the film's end.  The plot was written brilliantly.  They combine comedy, drama, and action wonderfully.  Their run from the law offers audiences many twists and turns as they encounter unpleasant visiters.  The intensity keeps audiences guessing their next move in every scene.  Only one other fugitive film comes close to the quality of &quot;Thelma And Louise&quot;: &quot;Bonnie And Clyde&quot;.  However, no other film released before, during, and after matches the uniqueness.  Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon add their own sense of theme in their Oscar-nominated roles for Best Actress.  Their words and emotions are flawless from their Texas accent to their intense life struggles.

I got the regular version without the documentary.What added to my own confusion is that there is only one instance of this movie on DVD, and Amazon doesn't have ""Special Edition"" in the title. But the product description says it IS the special edition.To add to the confusion, the user submitted images show both regular and special editions of the DVD.So I guess I'll talk about the version I have - the non-special edition version. At least the version I got has some special features. Two commentary tracks. One by the director Ridley Scott, the other by Susan, Geena and writer  Callie Khouri. I was hoping for a bit more insight into the writing, but there was still great stories that they told. With my audio setup, I noticed that the left channel had both Geena and Susan's voices clear, but the right channel wasn't recording Susan Sarandon's voice. Turning up the volume I could hear here in the background, but her microphone most certainly was not coming through my right speaker.The problem is the same for the writer. She is ONLY heard in the right channel, not at all in the left, not even at full volume.Ridley Scott gives an awesome commentary track. The only downside there would be it sounds kind of echoey, like's he's in a big living room.The film transfer looks fairly good however, there is some black space on the far left edge of the screen. I hope that doesn't mean the image was shifted to the right and some is cut off. My guess is that's the look of the full film space because that would be where the audio track would be placed on the film.The deleted scenes are nice. They are isolated from the film and you can view them all at once or view them individually. They also play the footage that was kept in the final film at the beginning and end of the cut scene to give it context, very nice.

303917,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6302250269,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","In 1991, the American road movie, ""Thelma & Louise"" captured America's attention.One for it's strong female lead characters starring Geena Davis (""Beetlejuice"", ""A League of Their Own"", ""Stuart Little"" films) as Thelma and Susan Sarandon (""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", ""The Witches of Eastwick"", ""Bull Durham"") as Louise but also was heavily debated in American media about America's infatuation towards the movie and what detriment that such a movie can have on society.  But also as the film would have resonance towards viewers for women's independence and calling upon Hollywood that having strong female lead characters in a film does work and also can be a financial success.Directed by Ridley Scott (""Bladerunner"". ""Alien"", ""Black Rain"") and written by Callie Khouri (""Mad Money"", ""Something to Talk About"", ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood""),""Thelma & Louise"" was a commercial success grossing over $45 million in the box office and received six Academy Award nominations, winning one for ""Best Original Screenplay"". The film would also be instrumental in launching the careers of Geena Davis, Brad Pitt and writer/director Callie Khouri.In February 2011, ""Thelma & Louise"" will be celebrating its 20th Anniversary with a Blu-ray release courtesy of MGM/Twentieth Century Fox.VIDEO:""Thelma & Louise: 20th Anniversary"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (Widescreen 2:35:1) and to watch this film in HD was quite impressive.  The colors of the southwest to the Grand Canyon showcase its detail through this HD release.  Skies are blue, the Thunderbird's blue pops out, Thelma's died reddish brown hair pops and for the most part, the earth tones are what stick out in this film.  There is a good amount of grain and blacks are nice and deep and I detected no artifacting, DNR or edge enhancement at all.Definitely a major upgrade visually compared to the 1997 and 2003 DVD release and fans of the film will definitely be pleased by the vibrant colors and detail seen in the 20th Anniversary release!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Thelma & Louise: 20th Anniversary"" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and French 5.1 DTS.  While the film is primarily dialogue-driven and also featuring the musical score of Hans Zimmer and music which was appropriate for its time back in 1991, where you will hear the surround channels really picking up is during the final arc of the film when Thelma & Louise are on the run as they tend to use the guns even more and also featuring a pretty significant explosion which comes quite crystal clear through your surround channels.During the bar room sequences, you do get some ambiance but for the most part, it's when the action sequences are employed, where you will hear the more immersive sounds of the film.  But it's important to note that while there is action, this is not an action film and the clear soundtrack is quite appropriate for ""Thelma & Louise"".Subtitles are presented in English and English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Thelma & Louise: 20th Anniversary"" comes with the following special features (all presented in SD):* Commentary by Ridley Scott - An informative and pretty cool commentary by director Ridley Scott.  Scott provides the more technical details on how challenging the film was to make.* Commentary by Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis and Callie Khouri - A fun and casual audio commentary from writer Callie Khouri who explains what she wanted to accomplish through he screenplay and also talking with actresses Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, who talk about their characters and the scenes that they shot.* Deleted and Extended Scenes - (40:19) Plenty of deleted and extended scenes are included.  Especially the longer sex scenes with Geena Davis and Brad Pitt.* Extended Ending (with Commentary by Ridley Scott) - (3:42) Featuring optional commentary,the ending that I'm glad wasn't used for the final cut of the film.* Documentaries and Featurettes, including ""Thelma and Louise: The Last Journey""- (59:43) An excellent documentary in which Callie Khouri talks about the anguish she felt about giving another director a chance to work on her script but how she and Ridley Scott worked great together.  Also, how the talent were cast for the film and how many of them were newcomers at the time, especially Brad Pitt.  Interesting is Pitt's comments on his first major sex scene and how Geena Davis helped him through it.  Also, talking about the action sequences and how the film became a major hit and also cause for debate in the media.* Original Theatrical Featurette (with and without promotional narration) - (5:23) An older featurette in which the director and cast are showcased.* Multi-Angle Storyboards: The Final Chase - There are two segments featured in this section.

This story about two women who set out to have some fun via  two-day vacation and then everything goes wrong.  It's quite plausible and although the film has a good amount of humor, the film is ultimately a tragedy.Two women who had normal lives but their lives are forever changed.  But during their moments together, it's the most freedom that they have ever lived and together, they intend to make their time together meaningful and to go out with a bang!In some ways, one can watch a road film such as ""Easy Rider"", another tragic road film and capturing friendship to the last minute, the same can be said with ""Thelma & Louise"" but with strong female character leads, it was something that audiences have never seen before.  And I can see how the film would become an inspiration for women, not just for strong lead character roles in Hollywood but the fact that you have a film showcasing women choosing freedom, independence and to leave their banal lifestyle behind.  Granted, in this case, it was accidental and as some media have made a case over, these two women should be not considered as role-models.But the connection this film makes is not about the crimes that were committed, it goes deeper than that.  As Tori Amos has credited the film for the inspiration of her song ""Me and a Gun"" (which is about Amos' rape), the film especially Thelma being victimized as a slave wife under the control of a domineering husband and then being assaulted by a man who hits her around as if she is deserving of it.  No woman deserves this treatment and Louise, who has suffered rape before, shows Louise the benefits of freedom, away from the controlling Darryl and that she should stand up for herself.  We witness this change of Thelma throughout the film and the friendship and bond between friends growing.This is the emotional connect that I have felt ""Thelma & Louise"" has managed to resonate with many viewers, many women, because these two women are not going to take it anymore.  And while some feared at the time that women would do some acts of vengeance on the men or husbands that have wronged them, the truth is that ""Thelma & Louise"" provided a voice for many women who have kept quiet about rape or their poor treatment by a love one.  The movie was probably not meant or was expected to resonate so strongly but it did.As for the film, the imagery of Thelma & Louise grabbing a gun and shooting them towards a tanker, is one of the wonderful images of the film, and of course the final scene has become quite iconic and still remembered two decades later.""Thelma & Louise"" is a wonderful and magnificent film and definitely a highlight of movie screenplays courtesy of Callie Khouri and I felt that having Ridley Scott as the director, gave the film its necessary push to make it seem raw, real and visual for the audience.And of course, the wonderful acting by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis.  Both were extraordinary in this film and I've read that Michelle Pfeiffer and Melanie Griffith were originally considered for Thelma and Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton, Anjelica Huston were considered for Louise.  Personally, it's something I can't even fathom.  This was a well-cast film and Sarandon and Davis had wonderful screen chemistry and the two did a fantastic job!  And of course, for the Brad Pitt fans, this is the movie that literally launched his career.As for the 20th anniversary Blu-ray release, first let me say that Twentieth Century Fox has done a great job with these re-releases to celebrate the anniversaries of ""Dancing with Wolves"" and ""Raging Bull"" and here we are with ""Thelma & Louise"" and while I do feel the release is fantastic when it comes to PQ and AQ, while it does have the awesome ""The Last Journey"" featurette, its still the same standard definition features that came on DVD before.  I just felt that for a 20th anniversary, it would have been great to revisit with Calli Khouri, Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis.  I suppose that the footage shot for its 10th anniversary would be enough for people but it would have been great to have something new to compliment the 20th anniversary Blu-ray release.Overall, ""Thelma & Louise: 20th Anniversary"" is a welcomed upgrade from its previous 2003 DVD release.  The film looks and sounds magnificent in HD and the audio commentary and featurettes included are still informative and enjoyable today.  If you are a big fan of this film or if you are looking for a film on Blu-ray that is well-made, well-written and well-acted, you can't go wrong with ""Thelma & Louise"".Highly recommended!",4,"Blu-ray:  ""Thelma & Louise"" continues to be an iconic film, 20 years later.

303918,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6302250269,Dennis Littrell,"[63, 79]","This is an important commercial film aimed at blue collar women who feel victimized by both society and the men in their lives.  Directed by Ridley Scott, who directed the science fiction classics, Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982), Thelma and Louise is an on-the-lam chick flick (with chase scenes), a kind of femme Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), somewhat akin to Wild at Heart (1990) and Natural Born Killers (1994) but without the gratuitous violence of those films.  Ridley Scott walks the razor edge between femme-exploitation and serious social commentary.  Incidentally, the script is by Callie Khouri who wrote Something to Talk About (1995) and Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (2002) which should give you an idea of how men are depicted here.Susan Sarandon is Louise, a thirty-something Arkansas waitress with an attitude and some emotional baggage, and Geena Davis is Thelma, a cloistered ingenue housewife with a yearning to breath free.  Both do an outstanding job and carry the film from beginning to end.  The characters they play are well-rounded and fully developed and sympathetic, in contrast to the men in the film who are for the most part merely clich&eacute;s, or in the case of Darryl (Christopher McDonald), Thelma's boorish husband, or the troll-like truck driver, burlesques.I have never seen Geena Davis better.  Her unique style is melded very well into a naive woman who never had a chance to express herself, but goes hog wild and seems a natural at it when the time comes.  Sarandon is also at the top of her game and plays the crusty, worldly wise, vulnerable Louise with tenderness and understanding.  Note, by the way, her pinned up in back hair-style, directly lifted from TV's Polly Holliday (&quot;Kiss my grits!&quot;) who appeared as a waitress in the seventies sitcoms &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Flo.&quot;Harvey Keitel plays the almost sympathetic cop, Hal Slocumb, and Brad Pitt appears as J. D., a sweet-talking twenty-something who gives Thelma the script for robbing 7-11s as he steals more than her libido.This movie works because it is funny and sad by turns and expresses the yearning we all have to be free of the restraints of society and its institutions (symbolized in the wide-open spaces of the American Southwest) while representing the on again, off again incompatibility of the male and female heart.  The male-bashing is done with a touch of humor and the targets are richly deserving of what they get.  The ending is perhaps too theatrical and frankly unrealistic, but opinions may differ.Best and most telling quick scene is when Thelma phones Darryl to see if he has found out about their escapades.  Weasel-like, he is trying to help the cops locate them, but he is so transparent to her that all she has to do is hear his voice.  &quot;He knows,&quot; she says to Louise and hangs up.Best visual is when the black police helicopter appears suddenly, menacingly like a giant fly beneath the horizon of the Grand Canyon.  Also excellent were the all those squad cars lined up like armored battalions aimed at the girls on the run.I also liked the scenes at the motel with J.D. and Louise's boyfriend.  They were beautifully directed and cut, and very well conveyed by Sarandon and Davis, depicting two contrasting stages in male-female relationships.See this for Geena Davis because she was brilliant, vividly alive and never looked better.",4,More than an exercise in male-bashing,1023494400,"06 8, 2002",2002,3425,"['important', 'commercial', 'film', 'aimed', 'blue', 'collar', 'women', 'who', 'feel', 'victimized', 'society', 'men', 'lives', 'Directed', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'who', 'directed', 'science', 'fiction', 'classics', 'Alien', '1979', 'Blade', 'Runner', '1982', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'on-the-lam', 'chick', 'flick', 'chase', 'scenes', 'kind', 'femme', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', '1969', 'somewhat', 'akin', 'Wild', 'Heart', '1990', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Killers', '1994', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'films', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'razor', 'edge', 'femme-exploitation', 'serious', 'social', 'commentary', 'Incidentally', 'script', 'Callie', 'Khouri', 'who', 'wrote', 'Something', 'Talk', '1995', 'Divine', 'Secrets', 'Ya-Ya', 'Sisterhood', '2002', 'should', 'give', 'idea', 'how', 'men', 'are', 'depicted', 'here.Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Louise', 'thirty-something', 'Arkansas', 'waitress', 'attitude', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'Thelma', 'cloistered', 'ingenue', 'housewife', 'yearning', 'breath', 'free', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'carry', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'characters', 'play', 'are', 'well-rounded', 'fully', 'developed', 'sympathetic', 'contrast', 'men', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'merely', 'clich', 'eacute', 'case', 'Darryl', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'Thelma', 'boorish', 'husband', 'troll-like', 'truck', 'driver', 'burlesques.I', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'better', 'unique', 'style', 'melded', 'very', 'well', 'naive', 'woman', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'express', 'hog', 'wild', 'natural', 'when', 'time', 'Sarandon', 'also', 'top', 'game', 'crusty', 'worldly', 'wise', 'vulnerable', 'Louise', 'tenderness', 'understanding', 'Note', 'way', 'pinned', 'up', 'back', 'hair-style', 'directly', 'lifted', 'TV', 'Polly', 'Holliday', 'quot', 'Kiss', 'grits', 'quot', 'who', 'appeared', 'waitress', 'seventies', 'sitcoms', 'quot', 'Alice', 'quot', 'quot', 'Flo.', 'quot', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'almost', 'sympathetic', 'cop', 'Hal', 'Slocumb', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'J.', 'D.', 'sweet-talking', 'twenty-something', 'who', 'Thelma', 'script', 'robbing', '7-11s', 'more', 'libido.This', 'movie', 'funny', 'sad', 'turns', 'yearning', 'have', 'be', 'free', 'restraints', 'society', 'institutions', 'symbolized', 'wide-open', 'spaces', 'American', 'Southwest', 'representing', 'again', 'off', 'again', 'incompatibility', 'male', 'female', 'heart', 'male-bashing', 'done', 'touch', 'humor', 'targets', 'are', 'richly', 'deserving', 'what', 'get', 'ending', 'perhaps', 'too', 'theatrical', 'frankly', 'unrealistic', 'opinions', 'may', 'differ.Best', 'most', 'telling', 'quick', 'scene', 'when', 'Thelma', 'Darryl', 'see', 'found', 'out', 'escapades', 'Weasel-like', 'trying', 'help', 'cops', 'locate', 'so', 'transparent', 'do', 'hear', 'voice', 'quot', 'quot', 'Louise', 'hangs', 'up.Best', 'visual', 'when', 'black', 'police', 'helicopter', 'suddenly', 'menacingly', 'giant', 'fly', 'horizon', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'Also', 'excellent', 'were', 'squad', 'cars', 'lined', 'up', 'armored', 'battalions', 'aimed', 'girls', 'run.I', 'also', 'liked', 'scenes', 'motel', 'J.D', 'Louise', 'boyfriend', 'were', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'cut', 'very', 'well', 'conveyed', 'Sarandon', 'Davis', 'depicting', 'two', 'contrasting', 'stages', 'male-female', 'relationships.See', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'was', 'brilliant', 'vividly', 'alive', 'never', 'looked', 'better']",N/A

303921,A2L2M2J3879ID8,6302250269,Doug Briggs,"[3, 4]","Thelma &amp; Louise: , Ridley Scott's great direction of Callie Khouri's flawless scriptof and a fine cast, splendid photography, music that was right on the mark in every scene.This is what great movie making is all  about, and this one was my idea of superb entertainment. Not one scene was  off a scintilla. The actors' every facial and physical expressions brought  forth the emotion called for by every last scene, voice intonations were  perfect.When Louise cautioned Thelma against being so open, Thelma's  response, after revealing her inner pain with expression, was simply,  &quot;Right!&quot; with an emphatic little nod of her head. A tiny snippet,  but like every other part of the movie it was precisely right.  When a look  would do, there was no dialog.

I completely agree.If you put the sexual politics aside, what you have is a story of two human beings who have spent their whole lives being oppressed and controlled by other people. Louise (Sarandon) is a waitress with a tragic past and an unreliable boyfriend. Thelma is a housewife with an arrogant, controlling husband. The two decide to embark on an impromptu vacation, but while stopping for a couple of drinks at a redneck nightclub, Thelma is almost raped by a lecherous customer, and Louise shoots and kills him in the parking lot. Instead of going to the police, the two decide to skip the country and head to Mexico, but a string of unfortunate events forces the two to commit even more crimes, turning them into bona fide fugitives and outlaws.Strangely, what the two characters discover is that their new lives as outlaws are more satisfying than the stifled lives they led before. At the end of the film, the two make a choice to remain free and never surrender, despite the consequences.This film asks the question: is the only way to be free in our society to be an outlaw?

Especially when there are those that seem to treat them as heroes. While they are not heroes, and I can't argue with many things the naysayers say, my opinion is that this is still one terrific movie.The story of how two women go on a short-lived crime spree made a big stink when it was released in 1991.  How a housewife in a dead-end marriage, and a waitress in a dead-end job get pushed far enough to strike back was written about as a triumph of the feminist agenda and a strike back at the male-dominated world.  I also disagree with this other extreme point of view.  Every crime the ladies commit should have, in my opinion, been punished with some jail time.But that old argument aside, there are other things that make the movie well worth seeing.  First, is the magnificent scenery.  I've made the drive from Illinois back and forth to Las Vegas many times, but have always taken the fastest highways.  As they try to make their escape by going down side roads AND avoiding Texas to get to Mexico, you get some breathtaking scenery that doesn't involve a Stuckey's or pecan logs.Then there is the acting.  The males are good, especially Christopher McDonald who wants Thelma as a wife of his molding, but only if it doesn't take too much time from his TV football games.  But Geena Davis plays Thelma brilliantly when you see the thrills she experiences on their little adventure.  While maybe not the best way to solve her problems, you can see that this is a woman who's been needing a good time for a very long time.But the cake goes to Susan Sarandon on this one.  Yes, she was premature in committing the first crime, but you can see that something from her past has finally been released at this point.  Not all at once, though.  The movie never really tells us her secret, but you can see it still simmering throughout the movie.  Next time you watch it, catch all the times she makes eye contact with old people on the road.  She holds this gaze for awhile, as if wondering if she will ever reach that stage, and if she wants to at all.

As he is just about to proceed with his vicious act, Louise catches him. After some verbal exchanges, Louise loses her temper and shoots the man to his death.Realising they hadn't a hope in convincing the police that it was an act of self-defence (especially adding to the fact that the entire nightclub had seen Thelma and the man dancing together all night) they decide to head toward Mexico to begin a new life.They are plunged into a series of adventures as they hastily head toward Mexico and it certainly is not without its complications as they dodge the police along the way who are hot on their trail.It is subsequently revealed that Louise herself was raped some years earlier which explains why she was so quick to shoot the would-be rapist. The film touches on the subject sensitivley and convincingly and Susan Sarandon puts in a carefully conceived performance.Brad Pitt also stars in the film in one of his earliest roles. Pitt plays J.D, where Thelma naievly succumbs to his somewhat cocky charm (however he soon robs both Thelma and Louise of all their money which they were using as their detour to Mexico).Thelma And Louise seemed to be a watershed for Brad Pitt as well as Michael Marsden (playing Louise's partner) and Harvey Kietel who both went on to star in the 1992 masterpiece, Resevoir Dogs. Both of their performances are effective and Harvey Kietel is fantastic as the understanding detective hot on the ladies trail who surprisingly displays a lot of empathy for the fugitives situation.As Thelma And Louise neatly unfolds it seems to steer along the voyage of self-discovery. The rich dialogue is complimented by superb, highly effective and concentrated performances from the versatile Susan sarandon and the bubbly Geena Davis.There are also many magnificent, eye-catching shots of the Grand Canyon along the way. The soundtrack is equally enthralling including tracks from the likes of soul superstars as Martha Reeves and The Temptations and all add to the effect of this classic masterpiece.Whilst there are some laughs along the way to endure (such as the pair blowing up a foul-mouthed van drivers vehicle up), Thelma And Louise stands as a compelling and riviting drama.",5,The Best Road movie Since Bonnie And Clyde,1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,2886,"['superb', 'road', 'movie', 'difference', 'Director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'shrewdly', 'womens', 'driving', 'seat', 'tale', 'two', 'long-standing', 'friends', 'who', 'go', 'weekend', 'spree', 'escape', 'usual', 'monotonous', 'small-town', 'routines.What', 'have', 'common', 'are', 'are', 'dissatisfied', 'respective', 'partners', 'However', 'what', 'intended', 'wild', 'holiday', 'virtual', 'nightmare.Thelma', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'Louise', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'hit', 'nightclub', 'first', 'night', 'freedom', 'Thelma', 'eye', 'man', 'long', 'two', 'are', 'drinking', 'dancing', 'together', 'whilst', 'Louise', 'hesitantly', 'end', 'night', 'man', 'trys', 'rape', 'Thelma', 'just', 'about', 'proceed', 'vicious', 'act', 'Louise', 'verbal', 'exchanges', 'Louise', 'temper', 'shoots', 'man', 'death.Realising', 'had', ""n't"", 'hope', 'convincing', 'police', 'was', 'act', 'self-defence', 'especially', 'adding', 'fact', 'entire', 'nightclub', 'had', 'seen', 'Thelma', 'man', 'dancing', 'together', 'night', 'decide', 'head', 'Mexico', 'begin', 'new', 'life.They', 'are', 'plunged', 'series', 'adventures', 'hastily', 'head', 'Mexico', 'certainly', 'not', 'complications', 'dodge', 'police', 'way', 'who', 'are', 'hot', 'trail.It', 'subsequently', 'revealed', 'Louise', 'was', 'raped', 'years', 'earlier', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'quick', 'shoot', 'would-be', 'rapist', 'film', 'touches', 'subject', 'sensitivley', 'convincingly', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'carefully', 'conceived', 'performance.Brad', 'Pitt', 'also', 'film', 'one', 'earliest', 'roles', 'Pitt', 'J.D', 'where', 'Thelma', 'naievly', 'somewhat', 'cocky', 'charm', 'however', 'soon', 'robs', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'money', 'were', 'using', 'detour', 'Mexico', '.Thelma', 'Louise', 'seemed', 'be', 'watershed', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'as', 'well', 'Michael', 'Marsden', 'playing', 'Louise', 'partner', 'Harvey', 'Kietel', 'who', 'went', 'star', '1992', 'masterpiece', 'Resevoir', 'Dogs', 'performances', 'are', 'effective', 'Harvey', 'Kietel', 'fantastic', 'understanding', 'detective', 'hot', 'ladies', 'trail', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'lot', 'empathy', 'fugitives', 'situation.As', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'neatly', 'steer', 'voyage', 'self-discovery', 'rich', 'dialogue', 'complimented', 'superb', 'highly', 'effective', 'concentrated', 'performances', 'versatile', 'Susan', 'sarandon', 'bubbly', 'Geena', 'Davis.There', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'magnificent', 'eye-catching', 'shots', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'way', 'soundtrack', 'equally', 'enthralling', 'including', 'tracks', 'likes', 'soul', 'superstars', 'Martha', 'Reeves', 'Temptations', 'add', 'effect', 'classic', 'masterpiece.Whilst', 'are', 'laughs', 'way', 'endure', 'such', 'pair', 'blowing', 'up', 'foul-mouthed', 'van', 'drivers', 'vehicle', 'up', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'compelling', 'riviting', 'drama']",N/A

However along their travels they decide to stop off at a nightclub and encounter a drunken, foul mouthed rapist who Louise shoots. It is subsequently revealed that Louise was raped and is the reason why she shot him. This plunges them into a cross country escape from the police as they head for Mexico to begin a new life.

I thought that it would be a silly female version of the buddy/road film. But I was mistaken. Eighteen years after its release, ""Thelma and Louise"" is still a powerful and comic indictment of the swinish side of the American male. Just about every guy in the T&L; is a boor -- the loutish, self-centered husband, the non-committing, violence-prone boyfriend, the predatory rape-ready good ol' boy, the betraying hustler, the disrespectful, disgusting trucker and male-dominated law enforcement. Every stereotype of the underbelly of US masculinity is on parade and is deliciously dispatched by the unlikely heroines of the film. Thelma and Louise represent femininity looking for a little respect and freedom, and finding none, blazing a pushback trail through the American Southwest. T&L; is very well acted (Geena Davis, Susan Sarandon, Harvey Keitel and Christopher MacDonald are standouts), fabulously written, and believable.

303940,A1HDXZ7HGOJTHL,6302250269,"Jeena ""Maggie the Cat""","[29, 54]","To describe this movie as feminist is ridiculous. The female leads don't use their heads, operate on pure and unchecked emotion (mostly fear-based), seem to feel alive only when they're exhibiting the same level of violence that the cartoon-character-evil-men they cross paths with have exhibited towards them, and finally ""triumph"" by committing suicide, albeit in a ""romantic"" fashion by driving their convertible, top-down, over a cliff at the Grand Canyon while they clasp hands in hysterical ""sisterhood.""Give me a f^%$#&^g break here, people. Feminisim is about responsibility every bit as much as it's about freedom. I don't know about your world, but in mine it's necessary to have a functioning brain, to be capable of rational thought and right action, to know when to ask for help and when to give it, and to be able to exercise some impulse control and deal effectively with unfair and sometimes even abusive treatment. Because it's not a perfect world. Not for men, and not for women. Deal.OK, the movie seems to posit that these two - especially the Geena Davis character - are so incapacitated due to the abuse they've suffered that they're not capable of any of that. Gee, sounds like the excuse often given by male murderers and rapists for the horrible things they do. And it just doesn't wash.Feminism does not equal intellectual vacuity and man-hating - although to accuse this film of man hating seems laughable. There are hardly any ""men"" in it, just stereotypes of men who exist merely to give the female leads an excuse to dig themselves an ever-deeper hole of violence and idiocy leading to suicide.Yes, suicide. Death. That's triumph? That's a feminist statement? Not in my book.This movie isn't man-hating because there aren't any men in it, only cartoon characters. But it IS woman-hating because it never even entertains the possibility that women who've been treated with violence and gross unfairness, women who've had their humanity stifled, might still truly triumph by undertaking the mostly interior, unglamorous fight for their own humanity and might truly win by living out life - yes, LIVING it out - on their own terms: creatively, lovingly, intelligenty, compassionately, productively, with self-awareness, as adults, in this imperfect world. That's real strength, and that's real feminism. The two-hour-long temper-tantrum the female leads in this movie engage in is not.This movie panders to spoiled, gutless American women who enjoy their ""victim"" role and who refuse to do the work of taking responsibility for their own lives, as adults, in one of the richest countries on earth. I suggest these women go to a place like Somalia and see what the women there have to deal with daily, and then come back and see if they still see a self-indulgent, self-pitying, mindless movie like this one in quite the same way.",1,Feminism = stupidity + suicide?

After driving for a while, the girls stop at a roadside nightclub.  Here, Thelma is hit upon by Harlan, a scummy local who tries to attract as many women as he can.  After several drinks, Thelma begins to feel sick and decides to go outside.  Harlan follows her and tries to force himself on her, but Louise and her trusty .38 intervene on Thelma's behalf.What happens next is a cross-country flight across the American Southwest with Hal, (Harvey Keitel) , a determined detective, hot on their trail.

Watch it with a good friend and you'll find yourselves energised by the zest for life displayed by Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon in their stand out performances. Like Thelma and Louise, you'll want to ditch your jobs for the weekend and beg, borrow or steal a classic convertible car, before setting off on a road trip adventure along the USA's dusty mid-western highways.The premise of the film is simple - put two ordinary people in an extraordinary situation and watch what happens as events start to snowball. Davis's bored housewife and Sarandon's diner-waitress are typical of thousands of women the world over. A chance encounter on the way to a run-of-the-mill weekend holiday in the mountains starts a chain of happenstance that thrusts the two friends into a situation where there are no signposts and no rules.Thelma & Louise is often classified as a 'chick flick', but this is perhaps somewhat misleading. Certainly it is true that this is a film about two women, and the men in the story are shown as ineffectual or lacking in understanding (although watch for an entertaining appearance by Brad Pitt in what is regarded as his breakthrough role). However one of the main themes dealt with is the emotive and perennially grey area surrounding attempted rape and how the reporting of it is dealt with - this is clearly not the fluff and insubstantiality usually associated with chick flicks. Despite this and despite the outcome of the film (which on one level could be viewed as tragic), the brilliant and insightful cinematography of Ridley Scott leaves the viewer upbeat and with a tremendous sense of freedom.",5,"""We're fugitives now, right?

303945,A8F2AZWB20X1H,6302250269,JLind555,"[0, 0]","""Thelma and Louise"" has been described as a road movie, a buddy film, a chick flick, and while it is each of these, it is so much more than the sum of all its parts that it defies an easy description. It's also been excoriated as an exercise in man-bashing, which it most emphatically is not. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis in the title roles bring a chemistry to the film that sets off sparks. The acting, Ridley Scott's direction, Callie Khoury's screenplay, the stunning cinematography, and above all, the film's score, played by the legendary B.B. King, make this one of the great movies of the 1990's.The movie tells the story of Louise (Sarandon), a thirty-something waitress, tired of the excuses of her commitment-phobic musician boyfriend, and Thelma (Davis), a submissive Barbie-doll type housewife, married right out of high school, used to letting everyone else do her thinking for her, and totally faithful to her cheating creepazoid of a husband. The ladies decide they need a break from the unsatisfactory men in their lives and hit the road for some R and R at weekend retreat. A chance stop at a roadside bar ends in attempted rape and retaliatory murder, and Thelma and Louise are on the road for real this time, running from the law across some of the most spectacularly beautiful scenery in the American Southwest.On their way, they pick up a lowlife drifter (a knockout of a debut by Brad Pitt) who almost ruins their chances for escape. When Louise, who has up to now been leading Thelma, is ready to collapse in defeat, it is Thelma who picks her up and takes over. One of the most interesting things to watch in this movie is Thelma's progression from a brain-dead zombie to a strong, resourceful, independent individual. It is Thelma who seals their fate irreversibly (murder may be a justifiable reaction to attempted rape, but there is no excuse for robbing a convenience store at gunpoint), and who rescues them when they are pulled over by a cop in Arizona.Sarandon is excellent as Louise, radiating authority and attitude, but Davis gives the performance of a lifetime as Thelma, making a seamless transition from an empty-headed hausfrau to a don't-mess-with-me lady in charge of her own destiny. A defining moment in her character development occurs when she telephones her husband Darryl and responds to his with characteristically boorish demand that she ""get her azz back here now"" with a suggestion as to what he can do with himself. Darryl is the film's comic character, a smarmy jerk too full of himself to understand what a horse's azz he is, his hyperinflated ego shriveling to nothing when he realizes his days of intimidating his wife are over. The supporting actors are generally excellent, but outstanding among them is Harvey Keitel as the lead detective, sympathizing with the women's plight but sworn to uphold the law and rope these wayward ladies in.The film is sad and comic by turns; the women have extricated themselves from the trap of unsatisfying relationships only to land into a deeper trap that is slowly but surely closing in on them. The humor is injected by some adventures along the way, notably with a highway patrolman who makes the mistake of a lifetime in pulling these two over, and dealing with a particularly obnoxious long-haul truck driver who tries to pick them up in Arizona, only to have his fantasies of roadside debauchery literally blown up in his face.By the film's end, Thelma and Louise have grown and bonded so closely together that both they and we realize there is only one way out for them. They can only run so far for so long, and there is no way we are going to see these two ladies in handcuffs. The film ends in the only way it could end, and while it's a sad ending, it's also exhilarating to realize that Thelma and Louise lived more in a weekend than many people live in a lifetime.Judy Lind",5,A long road trip to eternity,952128000,"03 4, 2000",2000,3883,"['Thelma', 'Louise', 'been', 'described', 'road', 'movie', 'buddy', 'film', 'chick', 'flick', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'sum', 'parts', 'easy', 'description', 'also', 'been', 'excoriated', 'exercise', 'man-bashing', 'most', 'emphatically', 'not', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'title', 'bring', 'chemistry', 'film', 'off', 'sparks', 'acting', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'direction', 'Callie', 'Khoury', 'screenplay', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'film', 'score', 'played', 'legendary', 'B.B', 'King', 'make', 'one', 'great', 'movies', ""1990's.The"", 'movie', 'story', 'Louise', 'Sarandon', 'thirty-something', 'waitress', 'tired', 'excuses', 'commitment-phobic', 'musician', 'boyfriend', 'Thelma', 'Davis', 'submissive', 'Barbie-doll', 'type', 'housewife', 'married', 'right', 'high', 'school', 'used', 'letting', 'everyone', 'else', 'do', 'thinking', 'totally', 'faithful', 'cheating', 'creepazoid', 'husband', 'ladies', 'decide', 'need', 'break', 'unsatisfactory', 'men', 'lives', 'hit', 'road', 'R', 'R', 'weekend', 'retreat', 'chance', 'stop', 'roadside', 'bar', 'ends', 'attempted', 'rape', 'retaliatory', 'murder', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'are', 'road', 'real', 'time', 'running', 'law', 'most', 'spectacularly', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'American', 'Southwest.On', 'way', 'pick', 'up', 'lowlife', 'drifter', 'knockout', 'debut', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'who', 'almost', 'chances', 'escape', 'When', 'Louise', 'who', 'up', 'now', 'been', 'leading', 'Thelma', 'ready', 'collapse', 'defeat', 'Thelma', 'who', 'up', 'over', 'One', 'most', 'interesting', 'things', 'watch', 'movie', 'Thelma', 'progression', 'brain-dead', 'zombie', 'strong', 'resourceful', 'independent', 'individual', 'Thelma', 'who', 'seals', 'fate', 'irreversibly', 'murder', 'may', 'be', 'justifiable', 'reaction', 'attempted', 'rape', 'excuse', 'robbing', 'convenience', 'store', 'gunpoint', 'who', 'rescues', 'when', 'are', 'pulled', 'over', 'cop', 'Arizona.Sarandon', 'excellent', 'Louise', 'radiating', 'authority', 'attitude', 'Davis', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'Thelma', 'making', 'seamless', 'transition', 'empty-headed', 'hausfrau', ""don't-mess-with-me"", 'lady', 'charge', 'own', 'destiny', 'defining', 'moment', 'character', 'development', 'when', 'husband', 'Darryl', 'characteristically', 'boorish', 'demand', 'get', 'azz', 'back', 'here', 'now', 'suggestion', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'Darryl', 'film', 'comic', 'character', 'smarmy', 'jerk', 'too', 'full', 'understand', 'what', 'horse', 'azz', 'hyperinflated', 'ego', 'shriveling', 'nothing', 'when', 'days', 'intimidating', 'wife', 'are', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'generally', 'excellent', 'outstanding', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'lead', 'detective', 'sympathizing', 'women', 'plight', 'sworn', 'uphold', 'law', 'rope', 'wayward', 'ladies', 'in.The', 'film', 'sad', 'comic', 'turns', 'women', 'have', 'extricated', 'trap', 'unsatisfying', 'relationships', 'only', 'land', 'deeper', 'trap', 'slowly', 'surely', 'closing', 'humor', 'injected', 'adventures', 'way', 'notably', 'highway', 'patrolman', 'who', 'mistake', 'lifetime', 'pulling', 'two', 'dealing', 'particularly', 'obnoxious', 'long-haul', 'truck', 'driver', 'who', 'pick', 'up', 'Arizona', 'only', 'have', 'fantasies', 'roadside', 'debauchery', 'literally', 'blown', 'up', 'face.By', 'film', 'end', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'have', 'grown', 'bonded', 'so', 'closely', 'together', 'realize', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'can', 'only', 'run', 'so', 'far', 'so', 'long', 'way', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'two', 'ladies', 'handcuffs', 'film', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'end', 'sad', 'ending', 'also', 'exhilarating', 'realize', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'lived', 'more', 'weekend', 'many', 'people', 'live', 'lifetime.Judy', 'Lind']",N/A
303946,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,6302250269,Joe Sherry,"[13, 16]","A film by Ridley ScottOne thing that I have never understood is that ""Thelma and Louise"" has been marked as this huge feminist movie (which happens to be directed by a man) that is taking aim at men and shows them all as pigs.  I don't get it.  On one hand this is a comedy (a lot of things are funny in this movie).  On another hand, ""Thelma and Louise"" is a western that has a car instead of a horse, and two women rather than two men.  It is a buddy movie, and a road movie.  Most importantly, this film is a tragedy (with all that a tragedy entails).  I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone who has not yet seen the movie, but considering the journey that these women go on and how it concludes, I don't see how it can be viewed as this feminist male-bashing movie.Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) need a vacation away from their men.  Louise just needs some time away from Jimmy (Michael Madsen) and Thelma is in a fairly miserable marriage where she is emotionally abused by her husband Darryl (Christopher McDonald).  Thelma leaves without telling Darryl, which she believes will get her in trouble when she comes back.  Thelma and Louise are off to a cabin owned by Louise's boss and they are going to have some fun (and for Thelma, this is a change).  On the way to the cabin they stop at a roadside bar to have a couple of drinks and dance.  Thelma dances with a guy who seems to be very sweet, but when she gets drunk he helps her outside and tries to rape her.  Louise comes out in time to stop the rape, but ends up shooting and killing the man.  Rather than go to the police, they go on the run not thinking that the police would believe their version of what happened (many witnesses would have seen Thelma and Harlan dancing cheek to cheek).This begins what is really the heart of the movie: the women on the run.  Some have said that having the two women end up on such a crime spree (from the murder to armed robbery) is glorifying the crimes and celebrating the women, but I disagree.  We have to look at why Thelma and Louise did what they did and what happens to them because of those actions.  There is no celebration here.  Yes, there is release and a sense of freedom for the two women, but there is also resignation.  They did their best to get out of a bad situation but they were never able to get their lives back on track and while Thelma is finally having ""fun"", she also says late in the movie that ""something snapped inside me and I can never go back"".  This is tragedy.Men do not come off as poorly in this movie as some critics have said.  Yes, Harlan the rapist is a horrible man, and he got his just reward.  Thelma is married to a real dirt bag of a man.  J.D. (Brad Pitt) is a mixed character.  He is smooth and charming, but ends up being a thief.  Yet, he is still a likeable and mostly sympathetic character.  To move to the other end of the spectrum, Louise's boyfriend Jimmy is an entirely positive male character.  So is Hal (Harvey Keitel), the FBI agent who is trying to bring Thelma and Louise in alive and as easily as possible.  He is trying to protect these women as well as apprehend them, but even Hal can see things spiraling out of control.""Thelma and Louise"" is a very good movie made by a talented cast of people.  Geena Davis (The Accidental Tourist) and Susan Sarandon (Dead Man Walking) are both Oscar winners, and Ridley Scott is a three time nominee for Best Director (Thelma and Louise, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down).  Callie Khouri's screenplay did win the Oscar for this movie, and both Davis and Sarandon were nominated for Best Actress in this film.  There is a strong Oscar pedigree here and it shows in the movie.  It is a well told story of two women who in their attempt to break free from their lives end up going too far and become fugitives.  While there may be a celebratory feel to this movie, I believe that would be a misinterpretation of ""Thelma and Louise"".

Reed,"[4, 8]","For all the guys out there who felt the this was a 'male bashing' movie I say wake up and begin to realize that your reality is not necessarily a female's reality.  There are indeed men out there who display the same  disrespect and inconsideration for women as is portrayed in the film.  The  same can be said for 'The Color Purple'.  Another absolutely fabulous  film.But for all you ladies out there who are steady screamin' 'You go  boy' I would say that you have to be willing to accept responsibility for  the choices that you make.  Like who you decide to date and marry for  example.  No one is responsible for those poor choices other than the  individuals who make them.  (Women)That being said however, the film  depicts, what I believe as a male is, a very unfavorable reality for many  women in our society today.  Disrespect for women as people, potential of  attack, restriction of expression, the list goes on and on.  Once again,  none of that is any excuse for suffering the consequences of the bad  choices that we make as individuals.  In short, our society does much to  devalue, exploit, and subjegate women.  But at the same time if you date or  marry a jerk and you end up being mistreated then that responsibility is  yours and yours alone if you decide to put up with that type of behavior.

Never mind illegalities; some of their misdeeds were deliberate and just plain wrong.However, I consistently wanted them to make it.  If Louise was not going to turn her back on Thelma, then neither was I.  Louise was the brains behind the outfit.  Thelma was naive and less-than-intelligent, and she cost Louise dearly many times.  No one could have blamed Louise for letting Thelma go in hopes that she (Lousie) could still make it.Louise's love and friendship for Thelma turned out to be more fierce than her instinct for survival.  Who wouldn't want to be on their team?Another compelling thing about this film is the go-for-broke mentality.  As their situations deteriorate, they start pushing boundaries and limits in ways that most of us never will.  It becomes impossible to look away.If you have only ever watched this on cable, you should rent this film at least once to see the missing scene between the stranded desert cop and the Rastafarian.  It offers comic relief in a tale laced with desperation.

The film is a winner just for its artistic merits.  Ridley Scott knew how to put together the music, the mood, the pace, and the  setting.  Recall the curious matron at the bus stop gazing at Louise in her  convertible while she waits for Thelma, who incidentally was robbing the  store---that camera motion, the light, the music matching the naive  curiosity, and the incongruous presence of Louise in the T'bird.  And then,  the aimless driving in the moonlight surrounded by the rock monuments of  Arches National Park, and Louise's contemplating their fate amid such  beautiful surroundings at the crack of dawn---indeed a powerful scene  evoking the experiences of awe some of us have had when in the midst of  these humbling desert vastness.  What could she be thinking that kept her  awake, while her less mature soulmate was fast asleep in the car?  Even  more powerful was the scene when they flee the chaos of countless police  cars chasing them in the field, and finding themselves in the yawning rock  wilderness of Canyonlands National Park. The ominous silence, a minimum of  background music that builds up slowly to the portent of the helicopter  hovering, but still hidden, alongside them above the Colorado River, and  then suddenly emerging face-to-face, much to their desperation, or so we  think.

303965,A28LG0XGUUCXUV,6302250269,Max Power,"[3, 6]","This modern flip on Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is an entertaining thrill ride through the American southwest. Thelma and Louise's escapades were quite liberating for them, as they were two women held down by typical society's constraints. Both women were trapped in their lives as a housewife and a waitress, who had nowhere to go. They had never lived a life of much excitement, especially Thelma with her overprotective husband. The two women start their liberation small, with Thelma not telling her husband she'll be gone for the weekend and the end with things like murder and armed robbery. The film is a great example of how women are equally capable of anything men can do. In this case it just happens to be violent crime, something that men are much more associated with.Many have argued that the film is not actually liberating to women, because of all the male chauvinist elements of the film. Elements like condescending down talk towards the women and how the men seemingly win in the end (they don't get to Mexico, etc.). In my opinion all of these elements actually contribute to the film be liberating to women. How the women are talked about and treated in the film actually works in their favor, because in the end they do things on their terms, not the men's. For example the women don't get to Mexico, but they aren't captured either. They go out on their terms, by driving off the cliff. Another example is how they are constantly referred to as `girls' by the police, portray the police's opinion of them as very lowly and not dangerous. When in fact they prove to be quite dangerous and capable it makes the police seem stupid, because they underestimated them.

Easy on the eyes, but the accents (or Southern drawls) will get slightly on your nerves!Yet again, I seem to be on a roll, and having a mad time reviewing films that have a common theme in them - there's lots of driving! And I still can't figure out the stunt drivers and all that kinda nonsense! A total of five identical 1966 Thunderbird convertibles were used throughout the shoot: one 'star car', one camera car, one back-up car, and two stunt cars.Susan Sarandon & Geena Davis make a great double act in this movie, with Susan acting more of the mother hen during some scenes, but sometimes it can swap over. And then they have a good girlie time.There's quite a few funny scenes in this movie, and they're laugh a minute. The sequence where Darryl slips and falls over on the builder's supplies as he is leaving for work was unscripted, as Christopher McDonald genuinely lost his footing. Despite this he remained in character (how hard must that have been?! I would have fallen about laughing), yelling at the workmen as he got into the car and drove away. Ridley Scott apparently liked the result, and so it remains in the film. In the scene where the tanker truck is shot and blown up, the reactions of Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis were supposed to be genuine. Rather than filming separate reaction shots, director Ridley Scott rigged the tanker to blow up during the take, in order to get authentic expressions of surprise from the two leads. Despite this, they were so astonished while watching it that they forgot to actually react, so Scott had to film their reactions again.For guys who are likely to start muttering about how Brad Pitt gets his top off in this movie, chill. I must be the only female in the world who doesn't think he's that terrific looking. He's easy on the eye, but not my type I'm afraid ladies. Give me Keanu Reeves over Braddy anyday! The problem with Brad is he looks like he would spend more time in the bathroom than me - except when he had that godawful beard that is! Brad leaves a strong impression as the charismatic blonde thief J.D. It's easy to see why this film made him a star. And what about the rest of the male actors? Harvey Keitel is charming as the sympathetic lawman, Hal, and Michael Madsen's turn as Louise's boyfriend Jimmy is wonderfully nuanced.The rape scene - he doesn't end up raping Thelma, but you know what I mean - is very graphic in some scenes, with close ups of panties and Thelma getting slapped about, it makes me quite teary.I enjoyed seeing the American countryside along the journey. From the dusty roads in the desert, the mountains and open paddocks, to the bars, hotels and roadside stops. It really gives a true feel of what the American rural areas are like. There's one scene filmed at night, where it's just them on an empty road, and it's breathtakingly beautiful. A scene to be seen - if you get my drift.This special edition has loads of cool looking, but dull extras. Your bog standard extras basically. I was really looking forward to the alternative ending with commentary (love these things), but it disappointed me.

Their first night out, Thelma has a terrifying experience...Louise, in her efforts to save her, commits a major crime. Suddenly, they are no longer two pals going on a trip...they are fugitives running for their freedom and from the law.

Other movies followed but none so good as this.  Here the road movie is turned on its head in that it's two women behind the wheel this time rather than the men that we're so used to seeing.  This movie can genuinely claim to have it all.  There are some absolutely laugh-out-loud scenes, dramatic car chases and some truly touching moments between the two friends.  Difficult scenes such as the rape scene early on are handled sensitively and without exploitation.Basically Thelma and Louise (with Sarandon and Davis giving their best ever performances - and yes that even includes 'Dead Man Walking') decide to up sticks for a holiday, but find themselves on the run after shooting a man.  What follows is a fantastic escapist piece and it's easy to see why it is so popular.  It's also thought-provoking when Thelma says 'at least this way I'm having fun'.  Is fun defying the law?  The audience certainly has fun watching the two break the boundaries, but the end result of the film seems to be that true freedom comes at a cost.  This is seen in a spectacular end scene on the Grand Canyon that will have you on the edge of your seat.True, the humour is obvious role-reversal.

At first I was skeptical that the movie would live up to all the positive stories I heard about it years ago when it was released.  After watching the entire movie I am happy to admit that I was wrong to be so pessimistic.'Thelma and Louise' is a brilliant look at the way our lives are affected by the decisions we make and it offers an insightful glimpse into the way many women think.  Although I cannot relate totally to either of these women, virtually every woman I know has personality attributes similar to these characters.

303984,A20NJAPECFGIR9,6302250269,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[5, 8]","I hadn't seen Thelma and Louise in years. I had forgotten everything about it except the attempted rape. It's an okay film but I still don't get how it became such a big hit. I guess the star power of Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon made this film so popular. They definitely brought spark to their characters but other than that this movie is nothing special.Thelma and Louise are two hometown best friends. Thelma is married to a car salesman, Darryl and Louise has a thuggish boyfriend named Jimmy. Other than that, we know hardly anything about these women. The movie begins with a tiny glimpse of their regular lives and then they are off on the open road for the entire film.While at a truck stop bar Thelma meets a man, Harlen who tries to rape her in the parking lot. Louise shoots him and the two take off. From there Louise and Thelma spend their time in hotels, staying clear of the cops.There are many familiar faces as supporting characters such as Michael Madsen, Brad Pitt and Harvey Keitel.The only big problem I had with the film was Thelma's completely unrealistic and annoying behavior. Here she is almost raped and in the next scene she acts like nothing ever happened to her! It was so maddening to see how she behaved. And if that's not bad enough she even has an affair (after almost being raped)! Pathetic and pitiful. That is why it's so hard to take anything that happened in Thelma and Louise seriously. Thelma's actions were despicable and too unbelievable to even comprehend. A huge disservice to people who have dealt with that type of violence and abuse. Even Louise didn't seem realistic. She just shoots a man and her friend is almost raped and she seems to feel nothing. She is just as cold and heartless to Thelma as she could be. Granted Thelma didn't seem like a victim but still Louise could've shown some compassion for her friend. All you get is, ""Shut up, Thelma!"" Louise was very selfish. All she cared about was getting away, not helping Thelma.People always hyped this up as the classic chick flick but to me it makes women look dumb and silly with the things they did. Thelma acts like a two year old and Louise acts like some gunslinger who is living in a fantasy world. Neither of them reacted with any sense. You'd never be able to make this film in today's world and not be criticized for the women acting so dumb.Another thing about this movie is it looks very dated even for being made in 1990. It looks more like it was made in the early 70's. The quality of the film hasn't held up well at all.If you haven't seen this film in all these years you probably never felt the need to.

Thelma and Louise is nothing less than one of the great movies of the 1990s. Louise is a smart-mouthed waitress fed up with men, and Thelma is a doormat who SHOULD be fed up with men. With minimal planning or forethought, they hit the road - and, following a nasty event at a bar that results in near rape and real murder, they descend into the world of fugitives, running from the law in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. Brad Pitt puts in a super-memorable performance as a lowlife drifter who takes advantage of them in the usual ways. And Harvey Keitel plays a cop with a conscience, another memorable role for a great actor.The most thought-provoking part of the movie is watching the evolution of docile and fearful Thelma into a Strong Woman (capitals intended). The final scene as the law closes in, they lock eyes, and gun the engine, makes viewers cringe and say, ""No, no, no, pleeese...,"" but there is no other way this movie could have concluded.

Following the conventions of the road film, the two women  make both a psychological journey as well as a geographical one.

It's hard to tell which one gave the better performance there are times that I think Sarandon is better and there are times that I think Davis is better.

304008,A1MZNOE1OABAQK,6302250269,thecableguy,"[1, 4]","I've been doing some thinking, and as I look at the careers of directors Ridley Scott and his brother Tony, I wonder if Greg Araki's ""Mysterious Skin"" is at all based on their lives.(If you're unfamiliar with the plot of Araki's film, click over to the Amazon summary then meet me back here.)Hi.So, maybe similar circumstances happen with a lot of men, and Araki just picked up an archetype. But check out 1991: Ridley, director of ""Alien"" releases ""Thelma and Louise,"" one of the greatest feminist films of all time. That same year, Tony Scott, director of ""Top Gun,"" the most homoerotic movie of all time (according to Quentin Tarantino), releases the bloody football actioner ""The Last Boy Scout,"" one of the most misogynistic films of the past decade.So, I figure if these two work on a movie together again its storyline will fit somewhere between ""Mysterious Skin"" and ""Alien vs Predator."" It will take place in the desert, and everyone on screen will be dead by the end, with the possible exception of an ugly Electra. There's an interview with the two brothers in a recent issue of ""Post,"" so maybe a collaboration is in the near future.""Thelma and Louise"" is a hallmark in cinema history, one of the greatest girl power movies ever made. Every man in it is a possessive, scheming creep (save Harvey Keitel as an understanding detective, and, to an extent, Michael Madsen as Louise's musician husband), and every creep gets his comeuppance. All of the scenes are beautifully and meticulously composed -- the filmmakers do an amazing job making shots that must've taken hours to prepare seem as natural and effortless as the good ol'girl banter between Sarandon and Davis. The famous ending, which would have been depressing or dishonest in the hands of someone less skilled, is genuinely uplifting without compromising any of the dignity and freedom T&L; have discovered during their journey. The inclusion of B.B. King's ""Better Not Look Down"" before their final leap of faith definitely helps.Ridley Scott's films seem to have more warmth, more humanity than T.S., which has me coming back to them more frequently. Tony's films are colder, flashier, more misanthropic. ""The Last Boy Scout"" exists in an emotional vacuum, excepting the dull rage running through every scene. The film's only noteworthy aspect is an early performance by Halle Berry as a dancing cowgirl (She is gunned down early in the film.)Any doubt about T.S. being more obnoxious and condescending than his sibling was erased by the inclusion of Pat Boone's ""Moody River"" during the film's credits. Here's a sample:""No longer can I liveWith this hurt and this sinI just couldn't tell youThat guy was just a friend.""How does T.S. keep getting away with the subversive homoerotic stuff in these macho action films? I would've never noticed if Tarantino first hadn't pointed out the ""Wingman Anytime"" analogy in ""Top Gun."" I don't know about you, but I just wanted to lift weights.Anyway, I think Ridley Scott's films, particularly ""Thelma and Louise"" and ""G.I. Jane"" are subversive -- they're absurdist yet humanist. I believe Ridley wants the men who see these ""feminist"" films to make him look very silly. After seeing males portrayed as intolerant, monstrous caricatures, I bet he'd be pleased if audience members turned to their partners and said, ""he doesn't know what he's talking about. Watch me treat you sweet.""On the other hand, these ""empowering"" films could be intended by some as a dulling narcotic, keeping kept women kept. Watching is chosen over the actual exhilaration of flying the coup. Near the end of the film, while T&L; cruise through the Arizona desert, Thelma describes a feeling which I think everyone, male or female should experience at least once in their life (preferably without the death and destruction). It's a feeling of freedom and optimism I suspect Tony Scott still hasn't experienced, and I suspect he envies his brother's ability to convey it so effortlessly during this film. Further projecting onto Tony, I suspect this deficiency eats at him, drives him to make angry films like ""Man on Fire,"" and feeds his ""Deja Vu.""Here's the scene:THELMA: You awake?LOUISE: You could call it that. My eyes are open.THELMA: Me too. I feel awake.LOUISE: Good.THELMA: Wide awake. I don't remember ever feelin' this awake. Everything looks different. You know what I mean. I know you know what I mean.

304009,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,6302250269,Themis-Athena,"[1, 1]","""BOOM!!"" Under fire from Thelma and Louise's guns, the tongue-wagging truck-driver's pride and joy (and extension of his manhood) goes up in flames. Incredulous, its owner stares at the spectacle and lets off a pitifully helpless and, in its helplessness, hilariously comical tirade against the two female outlaws; whose only reason not to shoot him, too, at this point is that it is so utterly more poignant to let him sit all alone by the road side in the vastness of the Southwest, robbed of all attributes of male potency and left to the pity of whoever is eventually going to pick him up and give him a ride back to civilization.By the time of this incident, Thelma has mutated from a subdued and insecure housewife to a self-assured, fearless queen of the highway. (""Something has crossed over"" in her, she tells Louise shortly before their final encounter with their truck-driving nemesis.) Louise in turn, who had taken the lead early on in their flight from the police, has overcome her intermittent bout of despair and is back to her old self, too. Now wanted not only for questioning in connection with the death of the rapist shot by Louise but also for armed robbery in another state, knowing that being questioned by the police will inevitably add a charge of murder for the incident which set off their run (and probably also knowing deep down inside that there is not going to be a happy ending to their weekend trip anyway), Thelma and Louise have stopped to care what is going to happen next. Thus emboldened, they make a last great run for it, which ultimately leads them to the vast, endlessly deep gorges of the Grand Canyon.""Thelma and Louise"" is all and none of the things as which it has been described. It is about the friendship between two women, about female independence and male sexism, but it is neither a simple ""chick flick"" nor a monument to feminism (although I have to admit that watching it can have an almost therapeutic effect when you've just about ""had it"" again with the male slightly-less-than-half of society). Most of the men that Thelma and Louise encounter are two-dimensional cartoon characters, but ""Reservoir Dogs"" and perpetual tough guys Harvey Keitel and Michael Madsen (of all people) are cast against stereotype. The movie also features some absolutely stunning pictures of the Southwestern scenery and mostly takes place on the road, but it is not just a ""road movie"" (feminist or otherwise). More than anything, this is a movie about the things that shape the way we are, and about the consequences of our actions. Had Thelma learned to use her brain before and not after their encounter with Harlan the rapist, she would have seen him for what he was and avoided him from the start. Had Louise not been raped herself, she would probably not have shot Harlan at being provoked by him, after the self-defense situation was already over. Impulse? Fate? Justifiable homicide? Hardly. Thoroughly understandable? Absolutely, at least from a woman's point of view.It takes two extraordinary lead actresses to carry the movie's theme, and Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are the perfect embodiment of the characters they portray. Next to them, not even Keitel and Madsen really shine (although this may be in part due to the thankless parts they play); only Brad Pitt, in the role that made him an overnight star, briefly gets to sparkle. Callie Khourie was a deserving winner of the 1991 Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Original Screenplay, and both Sarandon and Davis would have been equally deserving of the Best Leading Actress awards. So would have Ridley Scott for Directing, Adrian Biddle for Cinematography, Thom Noble for Editing and the movie itself, for Best Drama -- in a year that produced many extraordinary films, it might have been more just to split some of the awards among several contenders, and despite the strong competition (""Bugsy,"" ""Silence of the Lambs,"" ""Prince of Tides,"" ""The Fisher King,"" ""Grand Canyon"" and ""Fried Green Tomatoes,"" to name just a few), it seems sadly underrated for a movie that has long since become a cult classic to only have won one of the awards it was nominated for, both on Oscar Night and at the Golden Globes.Also recommended:Fried Green Tomatoes (Widescreen Collector's Edition)Dead Man Walking",5,A cult classic -- not just for feminists.,1225584000,"11 2,

304010,ABLBRUT8DALNN,6302250269,Todd Smith,"[3, 7]","Nearly twenty-five years after it's release, Thelma & Louise is still heralded as a classic, and is on most critics best films list. For years I'd heard about how outrageous and empowering this film is, but I'd never seen it in it's entirety. I've seen bits and pieces on cable and seen parodies of it, but I really never saw anything that made me want to watch it. The story is an interesting one about these two ladies who go on a weekend vacation. The ladies go drinking and partying, which gets them into some trouble and leads to them going on the run. This is one of those films that has those classic moments that really shine over the rest of the film. I found Thelma & Louise to be quite forgettable, but it's those particular scenes that will stay with me. The cast was in class all it's own and I think that's why the critics loved this film so much. Thelma & Louise may have been revolutionary for 1992, but in 2013, it's really not all that extreme, and in the years since, there have been so many copycats, that it's hard to differentiate it from all the similar stories that came after it. Geena Davis is just unbelievably good as Thelma. I love Geena Davis, I think she's extremely underrated, and it's her performance that makes this film work. How she doesn't win the Oscar for her portrayal of Thelma is beyond me. Susan Sarandon wasn't bad either, she's not really known for comedy and too me, she'll always be the one who prevented Bull Durham from being THE ultimate baseball film, but she was impressive. The cast member that was most interesting to me, was the young drifter, played by a good looking newcomer named Brad Pitt. In his first major film, Brad Pitt was so much different from the man we know today, it really showed the age of this film and just how much things can change in a relatively short period of time. It's hard to believe, but it was almost exactly five years after this films release that he starred in Se7en. As I said previously, this film is considered to be one of the best films of all time and it's gain that reputation because of it's performances and stand out scenes. Thelma & Louise have their moments on their little adventure, but in the end, it's familiar, predictable, and forgettable.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review!

The acting is wonderful. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis have never had finer performances and the supporting &#34;male&#34; cast does just as fine a job (not only was this the film that made Brad Pitt a star, this also was the movie that jump-started Harvey Keitel's career). After his success with ALIEN, Ridley Scott made a few lackluster films before striking the goldmine again with THELMA AND LOUISE. Just about everything he did with the movie illustrates how talented of a filmmaker he is, from the vista views to the soundtrack to the casting to the closing scene.Nevertheless, with all the wonderful things about the film, the movie is simply a buddy flick, but with women instead of men. A buddy flick about two women had really never quite been done before and the film did cause some controversy. It is also true that the film touches upon broad topics and social issues such as rape, justice, and what it means to be free (freedom always comes with a price tag). The film also has a great soundtrack and some awesome visuals of the American southwest. Still when you drain the memorable melodies and take all the pretty pictures away, the film remains at the core as simply just another buddy flick.

Especially in an instant of passion and rage. Maybe I love it because Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are just such everyday people who manage to come across as unique- simple yet complex at the same time. Geena Davis is so naiive and lovable, but you just want to scream at her at some parts of the movie because their fate could have been different if she'd only just learned from her mistakes.

Susan Sarandon is a brilliant actress, and along wtih Geena Davis, bring together the story of two friends setting off for a weekend away with the chance to leave their useless partners behind.  Things change of course, and it becomes one adventure after another.  What makes this film so special is the way the characters change - it happens gradually and is convincing.  Both of them become better people for their experiences.DVD SUMMARY:When this film was first released on DVD, it had a very poor transfer, and audio problems to boot.  Avoid that orginal release.  The 'Special Edition DVD' fixes both these problems, and also comes with an array of extras that are too numerous to mention.

Well written, tense and well photographed, Thelma &amp; Louise is always near the top of my favorite films.  The story might be a bit unbelievable, but you get past that quickly as we watch two middle class housewives set out on a weekend vacation that soon becomes a nightmare.

Walker,"[10, 11]","If you can imagine a blend of ""9 to 5"", ""Smokey and the Bandit"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde"", you should come up with an approximation of ""Thelma and Louise"": a mix of adventure, humor and comrade in the style of the Burt Reynold's chase movies, and getting even with the stereotypical men who try to abuse, control or recapture these 2 women intent on a short escape from their boring lives. The possession of a pistol or two and daredevil driving enables them to silence or elude most of the males who try to abuse or capture them or just have some fun with them. Clearly, Louise and Thelma initially have very different attitudes toward the men who try to seduce them. Louise makes it loud and clear  she wants no part of these amorous come ons, whereas Thelma, especially after a few drinks, is often flirtaceous and sometimes willing. But, Thelma eventually learned that fooling around with strange persistent mencan have traumatic consequences, and joined Louise in rebuffing these advances. According to the DVD commentary, many in the audiences cheered and clapped when Thelma's would be rapist is shot dead by Louise for his continued obscene threating remarks in the aftermath of Louise's breakup of the rape attempt. This clearly confirms what we may conclude from the popularity of confrontational westerns and action movies: that lethal vigilante justice, when done in appropriate circumstances, is considered justified by the majority of people, regardless of what the legal system thinks and does.One gets the impression that even if this duo didn't face probable long prison sentences, they might have become permanent runaways from their unsatisfying routine lives. It is significant that neither had children, which may have alleviated some of their dissatisfaction, and which made their overblown girls night out gone bad practical. The fact that both these women were often foul-mouthed, smoked and occasionally went to seedy bars turns off some viewers, who label them brainless white trash who perhaps deserve some of the misadventures they suffered in their attempt to  have a short escape from their boring lives.Brad Pitt and Michael Madison provide two handsome hunks for female viewers to drool over, though very different. Brad represents the perfect con man who exploits naive vulnerable women both sexually and financially. He was the perfect bad boy for Thelma to find release in. Michael represents a man who isn't willing to settle down to a permanent one on one relationship, but who is willing to make occasional sacrifices for the women he has relationships with.The ending seems appropriate for the duo. Like Bonnie and Clyde, the pair eventually knew they were doomed to long prison sentences, or to die in a shootout, car accident or by their own device. Like Bonnie and Clyde, they were prepared to elude their pursuers as long as possible, and to engineer their deaths if capture seemed imminently certain.This DVD is of excellent quality and includes several special features, including commentary versions by the director and by a combination of the main actresses and the screen writer.",5,Why can't we just have an  innocent good time?,1208044800,"04 13, 2008",2008,3124,"['can', 'imagine', 'blend', '9', '5', 'Smokey', 'Bandit', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'should', 'come', 'up', 'approximation', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'mix', 'adventure', 'humor', 'comrade', 'style', 'Burt', 'Reynold', 'chase', 'movies', 'getting', 'even', 'stereotypical', 'men', 'who', 'try', 'abuse', 'control', 'recapture', '2', 'women', 'intent', 'short', 'escape', 'boring', 'lives', 'possession', 'pistol', 'two', 'daredevil', 'driving', 'silence', 'elude', 'most', 'males', 'who', 'try', 'abuse', 'capture', 'just', 'have', 'fun', 'Clearly', 'Louise', 'Thelma', 'initially', 'have', 'very', 'different', 'attitudes', 'men', 'who', 'try', 'seduce', 'Louise', 'loud', 'clear', 'part', 'amorous', 'come', 'ons', 'whereas', 'Thelma', 'especially', 'few', 'drinks', 'often', 'flirtaceous', 'sometimes', 'willing', 'Thelma', 'eventually', 'learned', 'fooling', 'around', 'strange', 'persistent', 'mencan', 'have', 'traumatic', 'consequences', 'joined', 'Louise', 'rebuffing', 'advances', 'According', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'many', 'audiences', 'cheered', 'clapped', 'when', 'Thelma', 'would', 'be', 'rapist', 'shot', 'dead', 'Louise', 'continued', 'obscene', 'threating', 'remarks', 'aftermath', 'Louise', 'breakup', 'rape', 'attempt', 'clearly', 'what', 'may', 'conclude', 'popularity', 'confrontational', 'westerns', 'action', 'movies', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'when', 'done', 'appropriate', 'circumstances', 'considered', 'justified', 'majority', 'people', 'regardless', 'what', 'legal', 'system', 'thinks', 'does.One', 'impression', 'even', 'duo', 'did', ""n't"", 'face', 'probable', 'long', 'prison', 'sentences', 'might', 'have', 'become', 'permanent', 'runaways', 'unsatisfying', 'routine', 'lives', 'significant', 'had', 'children', 'may', 'have', 'alleviated', 'dissatisfaction', 'made', 'overblown', 'girls', 'night', 'gone', 'bad', 'practical', 'fact', 'women', 'were', 'often', 'foul-mouthed', 'smoked', 'occasionally', 'went', 'seedy', 'bars', 'viewers', 'who', 'label', 'brainless', 'white', 'trash', 'who', 'perhaps', 'deserve', 'misadventures', 'suffered', 'attempt', 'have', 'short', 'escape', 'boring', 'lives.Brad', 'Pitt', 'Michael', 'Madison', 'provide', 'two', 'handsome', 'hunks', 'female', 'viewers', 'drool', 'over', 'though', 'very', 'different', 'Brad', 'perfect', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'naive', 'vulnerable', 'women', 'sexually', 'financially', 'was', 'perfect', 'bad', 'boy', 'Thelma', 'find', 'release', 'Michael', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'willing', 'settle', 'down', 'permanent', 'one', 'one', 'relationship', 'who', 'willing', 'make', 'occasional', 'sacrifices', 'women', 'relationships', 'ending', 'appropriate', 'duo', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'pair', 'eventually', 'knew', 'were', 'doomed', 'long', 'prison', 'sentences', 'die', 'shootout', 'car', 'accident', 'own', 'device', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'were', 'prepared', 'elude', 'pursuers', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'engineer', 'deaths', 'capture', 'seemed', 'imminently', 'certain.This', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'quality', 'several', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'commentary', 'versions', 'director', 'combination', 'main', 'actresses', 'screen', 'writer']",N/A

But this movie is really about the psychological states of the two female leads and their road journey. And the movie does an absolutely terrific job portraying these and getting the message across, precisely.Susan Sarandon is brilliant (though I think she does a somewhat even better job in ""Dead Man Walking""), and Geena Davis is just fantastic. Davis delivers a performance so amazing that I like her as an actress and her as the character Thelma right away. Too bad that she's up against Jodie Foster in 1991's Oscar.Harvey Keitel's character (a sympathetic cop) is a nice touch. He's there to tell us that Louise and Thelma are not merely some crazy, self-centered irresponsible women. He said in the last scene, ""How many times has this woman (Louise) has gotta be fxxked over...""Some may feel the ending is too sad, inappropriate or unnecessary. But I just love that ending. It sums up everything of the movie. Perhaps one shouldn't look at it as an unrealistic end of their lives; It's an end of their ADVENTURE. It's their LIBERATION. Just imagine how Louise and Thelma may feel when they make the final decision and what they may be thinking about moments before the end, holding each other's hand... oh, what the heck....",5,"Ultimate Liberation: wonderful, memorable",1009756800,"12 31, 2001",2001,1329,"['storyline', 'simple', 'maybe', 'too', 'unbelievable', 'Most', 'male', 'characters', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'movie', 'really', 'psychological', 'states', 'two', 'female', 'leads', 'road', 'journey', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'job', 'portraying', 'getting', 'message', 'precisely.Susan', 'Sarandon', 'brilliant', 'think', 'somewhat', 'even', 'better', 'job', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'just', 'fantastic', 'Davis', 'performance', 'so', 'amazing', 'like', 'actress', 'character', 'Thelma', 'right', 'away', 'Too', 'bad', 'up', 'Jodie', 'Foster', '1991', 'Oscar.Harvey', 'Keitel', 'character', 'sympathetic', 'cop', 'nice', 'touch', 'there', 'tell', 'Louise', 'Thelma', 'are', 'not', 'merely', 'crazy', 'self-centered', 'irresponsible', 'women', 'said', 'last', 'scene', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'woman', 'Louise', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'fxxked', 'may', 'feel', 'ending', 'too', 'sad', 'inappropriate', 'unnecessary', 'just', 'love', 'ending', 'sums', 'up', 'everything', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'look', 'unrealistic', 'end', 'lives', 'end', 'ADVENTURE', 'LIBERATION', 'Just', 'imagine', 'how', 'Louise', 'Thelma', 'may', 'feel', 'when', 'make', 'final', 'decision', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'thinking', 'moments', 'end', 'holding', 'other', 'hand', 'oh', 'what', 'heck']",N/A
