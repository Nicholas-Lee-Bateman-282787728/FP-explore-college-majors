I'm giving two stars because at it's core it was AT LEAST funny.The story is about two groups; the Bloodz (Vampires) and the Werewolves.  The Bloodz are trying to go into ""business"" by buying property in the city, but they need the help of the Werewolves (for some reason), and so they try a truece between eachother.  Well, there are Bloodz who aren't interested at all in a truce with the Werewolves, and so they sabatoge the truce by attacking the Werewolves; causing the Werewolves to come back on them. Long story short, the truce only last a couple of days, and in the end EVERYONE(or thing) gets killed.While this was far from the best movie I've ever seen, it certainly wasn'tthe worse.  The acting was a little over the top but it kind of had to be.  I am a fan of B-Movies and buy them a lot and I don't regret buying this one because like I said, while on the surface it's a pretty dumb movie with a dumb premise, at it's core it's still amusing.I wouldn't encourage anyone to buy this, not even for $12.00. (I got it from the $7 bin at Walmart.)

Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[2, 2]","Imagine if you and your cool gangster friends got together to make a full-length feature film, or put on a play for your own entertainment.  That is pretty much what Bloodz vs. Wolvz is, and I think it is an ok try for a You Tube amateur filmmaker type story.  Other reviews say the acting was bad, but the acting was actually the best part.  The guys who play the leaders of their gangs, and the two vampire women, were quite good.  Everyone else was just play-acting.The other reviews are correct in saying special effects were just plastic fangs and PC effects teens use, and in that, perplexingly, there was no furniture.  Through the whole movie, there are only two scenes where characters are seated in chairs!  The premise for the empty houses is, ostensibly, that the vampire leader is selling real estate and clients are always coming to see property, but even in his house, there is nothing there.  The clothes, hair and makeup are very good, and there is one death scene towards the end that is pretty compelling.But the cover of this DVD does not represent accurately AT ALL the makeup and effects.",2,You Tube Type Movie,1222646400,"09 29, 2008",2008,1110,"['Imagine', 'cool', 'gangster', 'friends', 'got', 'together', 'make', 'full-length', 'feature', 'film', 'put', 'play', 'own', 'entertainment', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'Bloodz', 'vs.', 'Wolvz', 'think', 'ok', 'try', 'Tube', 'amateur', 'filmmaker', 'type', 'story', 'Other', 'reviews', 'say', 'acting', 'was', 'bad', 'acting', 'was', 'actually', 'best', 'part', 'guys', 'who', 'play', 'leaders', 'gangs', 'two', 'vampire', 'women', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'Everyone', 'else', 'was', 'just', 'play-acting.The', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'correct', 'saying', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'just', 'plastic', 'fangs', 'PC', 'effects', 'use', 'perplexingly', 'was', 'furniture', 'whole', 'movie', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'scenes', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'seated', 'chairs', 'premise', 'empty', 'houses', 'ostensibly', 'vampire', 'leader', 'selling', 'real', 'estate', 'clients', 'are', 'always', 'coming', 'see', 'property', 'even', 'house', 'nothing', 'there', 'clothes', 'hair', 'makeup', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'death', 'scene', 'end', 'pretty', 'compelling.But', 'cover', 'DVD', 'not', 'represent', 'accurately', 'AT', 'ALL', 'makeup', 'effects']",N/A

The acting was over the top when it existed, the dialog was silly, there was no production value beyond the fake fangs occasionally used and I'm pretty sure they had to share one set amongst the cast.  Additionally, this is the first film I've seen that there is not a single stick of furnature, carpet, nothing on the walls, nothing.  Do yourself a favor and stay away.",1,..Should be NO stars.
