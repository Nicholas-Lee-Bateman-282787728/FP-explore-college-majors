It shows a man overcoming peer pressure, a horse triumphing over the odds, and a second man triumphing over greed.If you prefer explosions, car chases, intricate plot twists, or vulgarity, this one's not for you.

Wonderful classic Disney film, from before they stuffed films with junk and gas jokes.That being said, I agree with other reviewers: Disney's PC removal of the pub scene (when the pub was the centre of culture in America for 400+ years) is laughable. What, they're afraid little kids will start hanging out at bars because of a scene in a movie set 200 years ago? Why not worry that they'll take up the dangerous sport of horse-racing? ...Of course, then there'd be no movie...why no worries that kids will act like Bruce the Shark in Finding Nemo? Where'd the editing of that go?Silly Disney. Kids aren't stupid. This movie is about the origin of the Morgan horse- warts and all. Great movie, a classic. My kids love it.
