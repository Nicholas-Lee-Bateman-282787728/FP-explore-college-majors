883811,AIZO3C0MDZ88A,B0007NFMB2,A. Alger,"[2, 3]",I am a HUGE fan of Stephen King owning just about every book and movie ever made.  I must say after reading the book and then seeing the movie come out I was mystified of how different the movie was from the book and how horrible the acting was.  David Arquette was horrible and so was the crappy back story of Johnathon Jackson's character.  Once they started on that my attention for this movie tanked.  I really wish Hollywood would realize that the reason some movies fail when based on books is because they lose something when you change or leave out too much of the book.,1,Just not the same,1134777600,"12 17, 2005",2005,578,"['am', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'Stephen', 'King', 'owning', 'just', 'book', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'must', 'say', 'reading', 'book', 'then', 'seeing', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'was', 'mystified', 'how', 'different', 'movie', 'was', 'book', 'how', 'horrible', 'acting', 'was', 'David', 'Arquette', 'was', 'horrible', 'so', 'was', 'crappy', 'back', 'story', 'Johnathon', 'Jackson', 'character', 'started', 'attention', 'movie', 'tanked', 'really', 'wish', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'realize', 'reason', 'movies', 'fail', 'when', 'based', 'books', 'lose', 'something', 'when', 'change', 'leave', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'book']",N/A

Or maybe it's a well-executed movie with a quite memorable message? You decide!I don't know much about who made this movie.. but it sure has a look of a low budget film [not necessarily in a bad way though] and it reminds you a bit of those 80's horrors. The acting is pretty good, especially coming from an actor I've never seen before. The plot is Stephen King so what's not to like.

883815,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0007NFMB2,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Riding the Bullet is probably on the weaker end of Stephen King movies (but still highly enjoyable and enticing of course since Stephen King *is* the master of storytelling surprises and effective horror, after all).It's about Jonathan Jackson's character who initially has major relationship issues and seems to be a razor blade-happy suicidal college student, but eventually the storyline changes completely when Jonathan scores tickets to a John Lennon & The Plastic Ono Band concert (yes, it takes place in the late 60's) and receives a phone call that his mother has suffered a stroke.  From here, he spends perhaps the longest night of his life hitchhiking to the hospital where his mother resides, and he goes down the darkest of roads and meets a variety of colorful people (and frightening animals) along the way.  That's what the entire movie is about... well oh, there's one more thing.For the majority of your viewing time, you'll be wondering whether Jonathan is a worry wart given the way he frequently questions every single decision me makes (and I really mean it- *every single decision*).  A mirror image of Jonathan appears beside (or behind) Jonathan the WHOLE time whenever he feels uncertainty.  It makes you seriously think you're stoned (and since the storyline is based in the late 60's, perhaps he is).  This other Jonathan character (that we're able to see, might I add) is sort of overkill given the amount of times he appears, and I guess he's supposed to be the voice of reason.  It serves as a nice aspect for a storyline at any rate.  Wouldn't expect anything less from Stephen King.You see Jonathan apparently suffers from worrying excessively to the point that it drives him absolutely mad.  He can't control it.  He HAS to question everything that's, well, questionable.  You can never be too careful!  Anyway the people that pull over and let Jonathan hop in their car are pretty interesting.  The one at the end that seems to recognize whenever Jonathan's not telling the truth is the most memorable one.  He knows more about his father's death and fills in the gruesome details.  I like the stoned out hippie one as well but he's only used briefly.The soundtrack is amazing.  I love 60's and 70's music so it's understandable that I'd value it so highly.  The Strawberry Alarm Clocks ""Incense & Peppermints"", the Electric Prunes ""I Had Too Much to Dream Last Night"" and the Youngbloods ""Get Together""... really good stuff.  It's also quite freaky when, in the beginning, the one kid questions what Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin and John Lennon will be doing several years from now and how they'll look.  Given Morrison's death, I wonder if that bathtub moment in the beginning is somehow related.Overall, well it's a strange storyline, but fitting for horror fans so I highly recommend it.  Definitely has a ton of atmosphere even though the storyline isn't the greatest (or the easiest to follow).  I wish Jonathan's girlfriend (played by Erika Christensen) had more of a role however- she's awesome in every movie I see her in but she only appears in the beginning and end.  Oh well.

Many of his short story translations haven't been all that successful; some were okay, (Sometimes They come back), some were terrible (Children of the Corn- eugh!), but this, Mick Garris's latest, refuses to take only the face value of the story, which is what most filmmakers and especially hollywood horror-meisters, do... (Just think of Dreamcatcher, that film was wrongly-conceived from the start; it needed to be way more camp and funny, I mean, it took itself way too seriouslly... It was an alien invasion launched out of someones sphincter!).This film however, explores the interior of the main protagoist and really- explores King's literature. Garris also carefully constructs the story; introducing the theme of the artist, and even more importantly, an artist in the time of Vietnam. His work is heavy with death imagery and indeed, he lives in scary times, yet Alan is put down by his art teacher who insists that he draw beauty from his surroundings, not juvenille scares.So it is established firmly that Alan, the main character- has an overley morose, yet creative mind. He is also emotionally unstable (his contemplation of suicide)- due probably to lasting effects of his fathers death. And he is scarred. As one character points out, many children of suicide victims are more likley to commit suicide themselves- its almost as though his fathers death has numbed him to the concept of morality and how fragile it is ... Garris carefully justifies all that will follow, creating, as King himself does- plausible and fully fleshed characters.So what ensues is cleaverly, a double edged sword. Fueled by the stroke of his mother, we as an audience watch either a wonderfully camp Halloween ghost story, or very clever psychological drama. At no point, when you really think about it- is there any concrete evidence of the supernatural. All weird occurences are undermined by a 'leap in and outside the head'- scare, if that makes any sense...Also, in the same vein, many of his horror fantasises are fleshed out horror cliche's of the time; as though Alan's breaking mind is influenced heavily by the pop culture images surrounding him (reinforced by much of the 60's popular music)- for example, the Crow; someone with Alan's interests would surley have read Poe... Or George Staub himslef, who appears to be a zombie, is a definite horror extra straight from the 60's screen, George himself cajoos Alan with the taunt 'They're coming to get you Barbara...' which is a direct quote from George Romero's Night of the Living Dead. And again, the death of Staub is a funny and clever recreation of the over the top horror cinema of the time- with even seperating reality even furthur by establishing the flashback inside a theatre, inside a movie, with bold, 60's titles, Hammer-like music and an EC-ish severed head proclaiming urban legends!Man, great stuff for film buffs.And even if its not a psychological thriller; its a cool, fun, spooky road movie, with unexpected heart and quite a touching and melancholy ending.Garris has made an intelligent movie, its funny and heart-felt. Its a surreal adventure to be sure, but at no point does it lead you to think otherwise, you know what your in for from the first five minutes (featuring the Grim Reaper smoking a joint with Alan).Well done to Garris, who has done it again. I can't wait for 'Desperation'. Look quickly for cameo's, Garris plays a doctor, his wife Cynthia plays a nurse and one of the old guys in the pickup truck is a singer from that era.Have fun and if you didn't like it too much first time round, try it again.Drive Safe... mwa-mwa-mwa",5,undeserved bad-wrap...,1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,3844,"['dissapointment', 'feel', 'adaptation', 'other', 'King', 'fans', 'are', ""n't"", 'rellishing', 'it.I', 'wont', 'go', 'plot', 'beware-', 'spoilers', 'herin', 'What', 'wonderfully', 'fresh', 'approach', 'King', 'adaptation', 'Many', 'short', 'story', 'translations', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'successful', 'were', 'okay', 'Sometimes', 'come', 'back', 'were', 'terrible', 'Children', 'Corn-', 'eugh', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'latest', 'take', 'only', 'face', 'value', 'story', 'what', 'most', 'filmmakers', 'especially', 'hollywood', 'horror-meisters', 'do', 'Just', 'think', 'Dreamcatcher', 'film', 'was', 'wrongly-conceived', 'start', 'needed', 'be', 'way', 'more', 'camp', 'funny', 'mean', 'took', 'way', 'too', 'seriouslly', 'was', 'alien', 'invasion', 'launched', 'someones', 'sphincter', '.This', 'film', 'however', 'interior', 'main', 'protagoist', 'really-', 'explores', 'King', 'literature', 'Garris', 'also', 'carefully', 'story', 'introducing', 'theme', 'artist', 'even', 'more', 'importantly', 'artist', 'time', 'Vietnam', 'work', 'heavy', 'death', 'imagery', 'indeed', 'scary', 'times', 'yet', 'Alan', 'put', 'down', 'art', 'teacher', 'who', 'draw', 'beauty', 'surroundings', 'not', 'juvenille', 'scares.So', 'established', 'firmly', 'Alan', 'main', 'character-', 'overley', 'morose', 'yet', 'creative', 'mind', 'also', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'contemplation', 'suicide', 'due', 'probably', 'lasting', 'effects', 'fathers', 'death', 'scarred', 'one', 'character', 'points', 'out', 'many', 'children', 'suicide', 'victims', 'are', 'more', 'likley', 'commit', 'suicide', 'themselves-', 'almost', 'fathers', 'death', 'numbed', 'concept', 'morality', 'how', 'fragile', 'Garris', 'carefully', 'will', 'follow', 'creating', 'King', 'does-', 'plausible', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'characters.So', 'what', 'cleaverly', 'double', 'edged', 'sword', 'Fueled', 'stroke', 'mother', 'audience', 'watch', 'wonderfully', 'camp', 'Halloween', 'ghost', 'story', 'very', 'clever', 'psychological', 'drama', 'point', 'when', 'really', 'think', 'it-', 'concrete', 'evidence', 'supernatural', 'weird', 'occurences', 'are', 'undermined', ""'leap"", ""head'-"", 'scare', 'sense', 'Also', 'same', 'vein', 'many', 'horror', 'fantasises', 'are', 'fleshed', 'out', 'horror', 'cliche', 'time', 'Alan', 'breaking', 'mind', 'influenced', 'heavily', 'pop', 'culture', 'images', 'surrounding', 'reinforced', 'much', '60', 'popular', 'music', 'example', 'Crow', 'someone', 'Alan', 'interests', 'would', 'surley', 'have', 'read', 'Poe', 'George', 'Staub', 'himslef', 'who', 'be', 'zombie', 'definite', 'horror', 'extra', 'straight', '60', 'screen', 'George', 'cajoos', 'Alan', 'taunt', ""'re"", 'coming', 'get', 'Barbara', 'direct', 'quote', 'George', 'Romero', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'again', 'death', 'Staub', 'funny', 'clever', 'recreation', 'top', 'horror', 'cinema', 'time-', 'even', 'seperating', 'reality', 'even', 'furthur', 'establishing', 'flashback', 'theatre', 'movie', 'bold', '60', 'titles', 'Hammer-like', 'music', 'EC-ish', 'severed', 'head', 'proclaiming', 'urban', 'legends', 'Man', 'great', 'stuff', 'film', 'buffs.And', 'even', 'not', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'cool', 'fun', 'spooky', 'road', 'movie', 'unexpected', 'heart', 'quite', 'touching', 'melancholy', 'ending.Garris', 'made', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'funny', 'heart-felt', 'surreal', 'adventure', 'be', 'sure', 'point', 'lead', 'think', 'otherwise', 'know', 'what', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'featuring', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'smoking', 'joint', 'Alan', '.Well', 'done', 'Garris', 'who', 'done', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', ""'Desperation"", 'Look', 'quickly', 'cameo', 'Garris', 'doctor', 'wife', 'Cynthia', 'nurse', 'one', 'old', 'guys', 'pickup', 'truck', 'singer', 'era.Have', 'fun', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'too', 'much', 'first', 'time', 'round', 'try', 'again.Drive', 'Safe', 'mwa-mwa-mwa']",N/A

The short story, found in 'Everything's Eventual', was not one of his best. In fact, the whole book was quite dissapointing. It read like something that was forced out because he had a deadline to meet, and no original ideas to go with. When I read the story, I figured it was just left over residue from his car accident, that his story telling skills hadn't quite made it back to the rest of him yet. Then I watched the movie. It wasn't so bad that I considered it a waste of the two hours it took me to watch it. It kept my attention and didn't put me to sleep, which is a lot better then some of the movies I own, ('Evicted' and 'Jack Frost' for example), so for that I give kudo's. However, I don't know if it was intentional or not, but the movie looked like something that was made for Mystery Science Theater 3000.

It's about a college student obsessed with death. On his birthday he's in the tub considering slitting his wrist with a razor. Then his friends jump in the bathroom throwing a surprise party and he accidently cuts his wrist. After he gets out of the hospital his g/f gives him tickets to go see a concert wih his friends. He then gets a call that his mom had a stroke and he decides to hitch a ride to go see her instead.When trying to get there one weird and nightmarish thing happens after another. He finally hitches a ride with someone who's tombstone he just saw at the cemetary. He freaks when he realizes that he's the ghost of someone who died in a car accident  years ago. The driver is played by David Arquette and he gives him a choice to choose to die or for his mother to die. So he's forced to come face to face to if he wants to live or die. This is a movie that can be often silly and not involve you that well in what is going on. I mean often the main guy sees another version of himself that gives him advice. Is it supposed to be his conscience or what ? and how is it that David Arquette sees him too ? We never learn that. Still the movie does keep your attention and keep you at the edge of your seat waiting to see what his choice will be.  The ending is probably superior to the whole  movie though because that's where most the heart is. It has a nice sentimental ending that you don't see coming at all. David Arquette turns out to be surprisingly some-what creepy in the role although I did get flaskbacks  of  him in 1-800-At&t; commercials.

883829,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B0007NFMB2,Matthew King,"[1, 2]","Over the last 3 decades a large number of Stephen King&#8217;s novels have been adapted to the big screen, movies of which King himself has been known to be a harsh critic of.  So I was intrigued when I read a King blurb on the box saying he thought it was the best movie adaptation of his work since Stand by me.  Don&#8217;t believe it.  Obviously King is well placed to analyze movies based on his works but I have often found myself disagreeing with his assessments.  King, remember, was utterly disgusted by the original film adaptation of The Shining.  I don&#8217;t know about you, but I (along with many critics of the horror genre) consider Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s movie to be an absolute classic of the genre, one of the top 20 horror films of all time.  As for Ride the Bullet?  It&#8217;s a mildly amusing film but ultimately a forgettable one.  I would really like for King to elaborate on what he thinks is so great about this film.The story takes place in Maine, 1969.  University of Maine student Alan Parker is a lost soul in search of direction, a misunderstood artist whose paintings about death and decay draw the ire of his art teacher and whose unpredictable mood changes draw the ire of his girlfriend.  Obsessed with death, Allan hits rock bottom after a botched suicide attempt.  But after receiving a phone call informing him that his mother is in a hospital in severe condition after a stroke, Allan puts his melancholy on hold and hitchhikes to Lewiston in order to go see his mom.  On the road there, he encounters a wide array of abnormities such as talking birds, a rabid dog, crazy drivers, crazy rednecks and DEATH himself.  Some of this is real but a lot of it is just in Allan&#8217;s head.  But no matter how weird the encounters and how dangerous the obstacles get, Allan won&#8217;t let anything get in the way of his ultimate goal: reaching his mother in Lewistown.The concept sounds really neat but as is usually the case with b-movies, Riding the Bullet falls prey to both its low-budget trappings and shoddy execution.  I found the constant flashbacks, headtrips and Allan&#8217;s discussions with his alter-ego ghost (that only he sees) to make for a confusing and shall I say rather self-indulgent experience.  The problem is that since we know that Allan is crazy in the head and imagining most of these things anyway, these suspense scenes feel, well, rather non-threatening.  That is usually the case with films like these.  If it&#8217;s all in the characters&#8217; heads and you know it&#8217;s not really there, why should you be scared of it?  Still, I must concede that Riding the Bullet is a mildly amusing film.  There are several exciting scenes of suspense, the hitchhiking concept makes for a suspenseful ride and the performances of most of the actors are commendable especially from lead actor Jonathan Jackson and also David Arquette in a deliciously creepy and over-the-top performance.  I think fans of King&#8217;s later works such as Hearts in Atlantis would especially like it.

883834,A37XGUQ1VH0XM6,B0007NFMB2,"OAKSHAMAN ""oakshaman""","[2, 6]","_This film is based on perhaps the most autobiographical of King's stories. That is why you have the motif of car accidents and hit-and-runs repeated over and over here. King was trying to come to grips with the aftermath of his own near-fatal accident when he was struck and nearly killed while walking alone on a rural road one night. That is a big reason why the artist who is the film's protagonist is able to converse with his own double (doppelganger)- this is King conversing with himself and trying to expel the demon of his own fear of death. That is what is so significant about him claiming that he has no fear of death- and his double mocking him as the ""Prince of Darkness."" You see, King finally met Death, and he wasn't at all sure that he could continue to treat the subject so cavalierly in his writing in the future._In the end though King, the writer, wins through. By bringing in the Staub character as the 1950's style greaser messenger of death (driving what looks like ""Christine"") he is staying connected with his past writing. By connecting this with reflections on his own mortality- and his mother's- he is immunizing himself psychologically against the reality of death.

Not anymore, and a lot of those countless b-movies made ""in his name"" (and by the man himself!) he has got to take a share of the blame for. I mean; Not one classic horror-movie is the result of any of his work. ""The Shining"" without discussion was Stanley Kubricks', and was and is a masterpiece because he made an entirely different version vaguely based on the book. Not that Stephen King is anything but a great author, but ""his"" movies over the years have become extremely disturbing, including the many he has contributed on. He does not impress me at all anymore.

883837,A3VHUQ85RH0BC3,B0007NFMB2,"Raj ""rajivsreviews""","[0, 1]","I enjoy reading novels written by Stephen King, as well as watching movies adapted from these novels. I haven't read the book where this story was taken from, so my review is not based on comparing the novel to the movie.Adapted from one of the short stories from King's ""Everything's Eventual"", ""Riding the Bullet"" takes place in 1969, revolving around Alan Parker, a man who refers to himself as the `Price of Darkness' (since he is obsessed with Death) because he leads a boring life. After surviving a suicide attempt, Alan receives a call, informing him that his mother has had a stroke and is in the hospital. Alan sacrifices his John Lennon concert to take a trip to see his mother. What follows are the strange incidents that Alan himself during his trip, including getting strange visions, being hunted, meeting eerie people, and later having to make a life or death choice.This is a very different adaptation compared to Stephen King's previous works. It tries to portray a dark humor, while at the same time, trying to maintain its suspense. In a way, I liked the way in which the movie was told, switching back to flashbacks, and providing a surreal look to the movie. However, I feel like the Mick Garris (who directed King's other stories like `The Stand' and the TV series of `The Shining' and is also currently directing King's `Desperation') didn't have much to add in the movie. For example, the first few scenes of the movie where he gets the John Lennon tickets and his first car ride with the weird hippie was totally unnecessary to the storyline of the movie. Just by adding that wasted 10-20 minutes of the movie. The story picked up only when the old man picks Alan up. Jonathan Jackson acted well as Alan, and the rest of the cast acted amply. But the main credit goes to David Arquette. He really acted his role outstandingly as the creepy George Staub.Overall, Mike Garris has tried to create a different look to King's story, which might not attract everyone. Even though it is different, and not that great, I feel it was a fair attempt to try and create something dissimilar than his previous works. Suffice to say, ""Riding the Bullet"" is just too unusual to be placed in the horror/black humor/suspense genre, and therefore, fails to be remembered as a great movie.",3,"Differently made, but for better or worse?",1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,2296,"['enjoy', 'reading', 'novels', 'written', 'Stephen', 'King', 'as', 'well', 'watching', 'movies', 'adapted', 'novels', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'where', 'story', 'was', 'taken', 'review', 'not', 'based', 'comparing', 'novel', 'movie.Adapted', 'one', 'short', 'stories', 'King', 'Everything', 'Eventual', 'Riding', 'Bullet', 'place', '1969', 'revolving', 'around', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'man', 'who', 'Price', 'Darkness', 'obsessed', 'Death', 'boring', 'life', 'surviving', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'Alan', 'call', 'informing', 'mother', 'had', 'stroke', 'hospital', 'Alan', 'John', 'Lennon', 'concert', 'take', 'trip', 'see', 'mother', 'What', 'are', 'strange', 'incidents', 'Alan', 'trip', 'including', 'getting', 'strange', 'visions', 'being', 'hunted', 'meeting', 'eerie', 'people', 'later', 'having', 'make', 'life', 'death', 'choice.This', 'very', 'different', 'adaptation', 'compared', 'Stephen', 'King', 'previous', 'works', 'portray', 'dark', 'humor', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'maintain', 'suspense', 'way', 'liked', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'told', 'switching', 'back', 'flashbacks', 'providing', 'surreal', 'look', 'movie', 'However', 'feel', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'who', 'directed', 'King', 'other', 'stories', 'Stand', 'TV', 'series', 'Shining', 'also', 'currently', 'directing', 'King', 'Desperation', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'add', 'movie', 'example', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'movie', 'where', 'John', 'Lennon', 'tickets', 'first', 'car', 'ride', 'weird', 'hippie', 'was', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'storyline', 'movie', 'Just', 'adding', 'wasted', '10-20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'story', 'picked', 'up', 'only', 'when', 'old', 'man', 'Alan', 'up', 'Jonathan', 'Jackson', 'acted', 'well', 'Alan', 'rest', 'cast', 'acted', 'amply', 'main', 'credit', 'David', 'Arquette', 'really', 'acted', 'role', 'outstandingly', 'creepy', 'George', 'Staub.Overall', 'Mike', 'Garris', 'tried', 'create', 'different', 'look', 'King', 'story', 'might', 'not', 'attract', 'everyone', 'Even', 'different', 'not', 'great', 'feel', 'was', 'fair', 'attempt', 'try', 'create', 'something', 'dissimilar', 'previous', 'works', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Riding', 'Bullet', 'just', 'too', 'unusual', 'be', 'placed', 'horror/black', 'humor/suspense', 'genre', 'therefore', 'be', 'remembered', 'great', 'movie']",N/A
883838,A2U0ABMZK6XBVF,B0007NFMB2,"Richard A. Tucker ""Tucker at large""","[1, 3]","This, for me, is a perfect film. It hits all the right notes and has a few bonuses. I like the setting and the period. It felt very genuine which is rare in a film with abudget as small as this one. The period is shunned by most folks because it's chic to deny or ridicule all things from the late sixties, early seventies (better to deny the problems from that period and those pointing them out than to face them down, which is my guess). As a former hitch-hiker  I know what it's like to be without wheels and have to travel a great distance over a very short period of time. The protagonist's choice to take his chances on a fall highway in Maine to see his mother, who's in a hospital, instead of going to a great concert with his pals was truly the act of a noble spirit even if that spirit is plagued by a fascination with death. Arquette's turn as a whacked out spirit of death incarnate was also a clever choice. He's always been a bit odd but as the harbinger of doom he delivered a wicked, convincing performance. The occasional scary parts were very well done. Not so much gross-outs (though there are a few) as nerve aching moments of clarity mixed with disturbing weirdness. The ""is this for real, or....?"" elements are wonderfully edgy but also poignant. A person's focus on particular views of life can often skew the most common things, but when those things are not so common they become moments of nerve shattering stress.Anyway, needless to say, I enjoyed this film thoroughly. Also, the the artist used to represent the work of the student/hitcher was that of Berni Wrightson! This was an unexpected treat as was the gallery of his work showcased on the disk's extras. Berni has worked on Stephen King projects before and since. He's illustrated the unexpurgated version of the novel The Stand, Cycle of the Werewolf and Wolves of the Calla (from the Dark Tower series).Best of all is the reality of living that comes through in this story. Life is sometimes messy but it is also something worth the trouble of living the best we can.I came away from this film feeling very good in an oddly pragmatic, but also, in contradiction, a spiritual way.",5,"A quirky, dark delight!",1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,2167,"['perfect', 'film', 'right', 'notes', 'few', 'bonuses', 'setting', 'period', 'felt', 'very', 'genuine', 'rare', 'film', 'abudget', 'as', 'small', 'one', 'period', 'shunned', 'most', 'folks', 'chic', 'deny', 'ridicule', 'things', 'late', 'sixties', 'early', 'seventies', 'better', 'deny', 'problems', 'period', 'pointing', 'out', 'face', 'down', 'guess', 'former', 'hitch-hiker', 'know', 'what', 'be', 'wheels', 'have', 'travel', 'great', 'distance', 'very', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'protagonist', 'choice', 'take', 'chances', 'fall', 'highway', 'Maine', 'see', 'mother', 'who', 'hospital', 'instead', 'going', 'great', 'concert', 'pals', 'was', 'truly', 'act', 'noble', 'spirit', 'even', 'spirit', 'plagued', 'fascination', 'death', 'Arquette', 'turn', 'whacked', 'out', 'spirit', 'death', 'incarnate', 'was', 'also', 'clever', 'choice', 'always', 'been', 'bit', 'odd', 'harbinger', 'doom', 'delivered', 'wicked', 'convincing', 'performance', 'occasional', 'scary', 'parts', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'gross-outs', 'are', 'few', 'nerve', 'aching', 'moments', 'clarity', 'mixed', 'disturbing', 'weirdness', 'real', 'elements', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'edgy', 'also', 'poignant', 'person', 'focus', 'particular', 'views', 'life', 'can', 'often', 'skew', 'most', 'common', 'things', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'common', 'become', 'moments', 'nerve', 'shattering', 'stress.Anyway', 'needless', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'Also', 'artist', 'used', 'represent', 'work', 'student/hitcher', 'was', 'Berni', 'Wrightson', 'was', 'unexpected', 'treat', 'was', 'gallery', 'work', 'showcased', 'disk', 'extras', 'Berni', 'worked', 'Stephen', 'King', 'projects', 'illustrated', 'unexpurgated', 'version', 'novel', 'Stand', 'Cycle', 'Werewolf', 'Wolves', 'Calla', 'Dark', 'Tower', 'series', '.Best', 'reality', 'living', 'story', 'Life', 'sometimes', 'messy', 'also', 'something', 'trouble', 'living', 'best', 'can.I', 'came', 'away', 'film', 'feeling', 'very', 'good', 'oddly', 'pragmatic', 'also', 'contradiction', 'spiritual', 'way']",N/A

True to form, what sticks with the viewer after the credits roll is not Jonathan Jackson, but David Arquette, who proves to be yet another actor who can capably ride the line between humor and psychosis.

Garris has made many King movies(if it's a mini series or tv movie, you can bet it was most likely Garris), and while his contributions aren't as memorable as efforts by other directors, Garris tries his damndest to stick as close to the source material as possible.  Plus he is one of the most active and dedicated individuals in the horror scene, and for that I respect him quite a bit.  But I can't honestly say he made a great movie here.  Not bad, but nothing worth a second viewing.  Much more plot has been added to the story in order to fill out the 90+ minute running time.  A story like this(which if I recall was around 50 pages, give or take) should have been done as one of Garris' Masters Of Horror episodes rather than a full length movie.  But when Garris is on, he's on.  Alot of the dialogue is straight from the story.  A big problem with this movie is Garris' repeated use of the daydream gimmick.  You know those scenes in film when something happens to a character(usually horrific and outrageous), then the scene quickly flashes back to the character before the horrific event and you realize that it was all in the character's imagination?  This movie is full of these.  In fact, it may actually have set a record for uses of this movie trick.  It seems to happen at least once every two minutes and quickly becomes silly and then downright annoying.  Plus we add a bunch of hallucinations and the main character continuously talking to himself(two of the same actor onscreen at once) and it dulls the suspense and seems like a desperate attempt at being flashy.  Plus, the film takes place in 1969, but every now and then we get a blast of very modern sounding music.  Personally I can't stand anachronistic music in a film that's supposed to be taking place in a different time period.

I am also a big fan of the lead in this movie Jonathan Jackson. Together I was expecting a can't miss movie, but it didn't quite work out that way. Riding The Bullet is just all around dull. The story was weak to begin with, the flashbacks were dull, the characters have 0 personality, and it just wasn't creepy in the slightest! If Disney made horror movies, they would be similar to this. I probably rated it higher than I should have because of my fondness for King and Jackson, but really this movie was a bore, don't waste your time.",2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,656,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'love', 'Stephen', 'King', 'given', 'hours', 'entertainment', 'am', 'grateful', 'am', 'also', 'big', 'fan', 'lead', 'movie', 'Jonathan', 'Jackson', 'Together', 'was', 'expecting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'out', 'way', 'Riding', 'Bullet', 'just', 'around', 'dull', 'story', 'was', 'weak', 'begin', 'flashbacks', 'were', 'dull', 'characters', 'have', '0', 'personality', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'creepy', 'slightest', 'Disney', 'made', 'horror', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'similar', 'probably', 'rated', 'higher', 'should', 'have', 'fondness', 'King', 'Jackson', 'really', 'movie', 'was', 'bore', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time']",N/A
883845,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0007NFMB2,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 9]","Stephen King's flair for good storytelling is absolutely missing in 'Riding the Bullet' directed by Mick Garris, who fared far better in TV's 'Shining' or 'Stand.'  King's original novella has potential for sure, which includes serious matters, life and death.  And King must have known the topic first-hand, for the story was written after he suffered a serious injury after a traffic accident.But Mick Garris takes things too literarily in this film.  The premises are intriguing.  The time is during the years of Vietnam War.  The place, Maine (you can hear the name of Castlerock).  One college student, obsessed with the idea of throwing his life away, realizes something important while hitchiking to his hometown, where his mother fell suddenly ill.  This is a fine idea for making a road movie, and hitchiking on the two-lane road could be pretty scary.The college student Alan Parker is played by Jonathan Jackson, who, leaving his kind-hearted friend Jessica (Erika Christensen) at college, encounters several strange drivers on the road (including one old driver played by Chiff Robertson).  The most unnerving one turns out creepy guy George Staub (David Aqquette), who offers Allan a ride at night, and seems to know many things about Alan's life in the past, including the death of his father.  But why?This story could be a vintage urban legend-like weird tale, but Mick Garris fails to make good use of it, by showing things without any visual imagination.  Think of this; if some 'inner self' talks to Alan, another image of Alan (played by Jackson himself) appears right next or behind him, and starts to talk to him.  If Alan sees 'visions' perhaps because of hullcination or smoking weed, Alan exactly sees, say, his mother croaking like a bird.  Or in another place Alan even sees a bird, picking the dead meat of some animal, and it really talks to him.  They are not scary; they are downright embarrassing.The film has good supports -- Barbara Hershey as Alan's mother, plus Matt Frewer and Nicky Katt.  None of them, however, show what they can really do, for the film is too intent on showing the visions of Alan, or his gloomy outlook on life.  In fact, Alan is kind of a student who draws a picture of a naked model with the Grim Reaper behind her, and does not notice the presence of Erika Christensen while she is always looking at him.  Why should we care about this guy in the first place?The film is not scary -- that's is not a problem -- but also, the film is awfully self-indlugent and doesn't know what it wants to do, like the protagonist it shows.  Horror?  Not exactly.  Nostalgic drama, like 'Stand By Me'?  Far from it.  This is after all just another wasted opportunity for making a decent film out of Stephen King.",2,"Wasted Chance: Like the Hero Himself, 'Riding the Bullet' Does Not Know What It Wants to Do",1123372800,"08 7, 2005",2005,2757,"['Stephen', 'King', 'flair', 'good', 'storytelling', 'absolutely', 'missing', ""'Riding"", 'Bullet', 'directed', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'who', 'fared', 'far', 'better', 'TV', ""'Shining"", 'King', 'original', 'novella', 'potential', 'sure', 'serious', 'matters', 'life', 'death', 'King', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'topic', 'first-hand', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'suffered', 'serious', 'injury', 'traffic', 'accident.But', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'things', 'too', 'literarily', 'film', 'premises', 'are', 'intriguing', 'time', 'years', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'place', 'Maine', 'can', 'hear', 'name', 'Castlerock', 'One', 'college', 'student', 'obsessed', 'idea', 'throwing', 'life', 'away', 'something', 'important', 'hitchiking', 'hometown', 'where', 'mother', 'fell', 'suddenly', 'ill', 'fine', 'idea', 'making', 'road', 'movie', 'hitchiking', 'two-lane', 'road', 'could', 'be', 'pretty', 'scary.The', 'college', 'student', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Jackson', 'who', 'leaving', 'kind-hearted', 'friend', 'Jessica', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'college', 'several', 'strange', 'drivers', 'road', 'including', 'one', 'old', 'driver', 'played', 'Chiff', 'Robertson', 'most', 'unnerving', 'one', 'out', 'creepy', 'guy', 'George', 'Staub', 'David', 'Aqquette', 'who', 'Allan', 'ride', 'night', 'know', 'many', 'things', 'Alan', 'life', 'past', 'including', 'death', 'father', 'why', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'vintage', 'urban', 'legend-like', 'weird', 'tale', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'make', 'good', 'use', 'showing', 'things', 'visual', 'imagination', 'Think', ""'inner"", 'self', 'talks', 'Alan', 'image', 'Alan', 'played', 'Jackson', 'right', 'next', 'talk', 'Alan', ""'visions"", 'perhaps', 'hullcination', 'smoking', 'weed', 'Alan', 'exactly', 'say', 'mother', 'croaking', 'bird', 'place', 'Alan', 'even', 'bird', 'picking', 'dead', 'meat', 'animal', 'really', 'are', 'not', 'scary', 'are', 'downright', 'embarrassing.The', 'film', 'good', 'supports', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'Alan', 'mother', 'Matt', 'Frewer', 'Nicky', 'Katt', 'None', 'however', 'show', 'what', 'can', 'really', 'do', 'film', 'too', 'intent', 'showing', 'visions', 'Alan', 'gloomy', 'outlook', 'life', 'fact', 'Alan', 'kind', 'student', 'who', 'picture', 'naked', 'model', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'not', 'notice', 'presence', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'always', 'looking', 'Why', 'should', 'care', 'guy', 'first', 'place', 'film', 'not', 'scary', 'not', 'problem', 'also', 'film', 'awfully', 'self-indlugent', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'protagonist', 'Horror', 'Not', 'exactly', 'Nostalgic', 'drama', ""'Stand"", 'Me', 'Far', 'just', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'making', 'decent', 'film', 'Stephen', 'King']",N/A

Well, she's totally wasted here. She played Alan/Johnathan Jackson's mother who was hospitalized and expected to see her son one more time in case she couldn't make it. Her role as well as Erika Christensen are totally underwritten, and it's not worthwhile for her participation. It's got good intension to be a horror film with a twist of family dramedy to it, but it just didn't turn out to be a scary experience for me.The story took place in late '60s or 1970 in Maine, but it's shot in Vancouver, BC. Alan is a wierd artist junkie/college student, and he's got some sort of split personality. He sometimes talks to a duplicate version of himself, unseen by anyone else including his girlfrien(Christensen). He imagined seeing a demon, exactly the one that he drew on paper. Upon learning that his mom had a stroke, he must hitchhike one hundred miles to the hospital located in Central Maine. On the road, he encountered a series of creepy things, people, and actual demons/ghosts. He even had hallucination of his dead father and forseen his mother coming to him from the hospital accusing him for being late. He constantly got flashbacks of his earlier years as a child living with his mother and the moment when he declined on going to ride the bullet(a rollercoaster), because he imagined the demon sitting behind him.Out of all the supporting players, David Arquette is the most striking one, and he actually stole scenes next to Johnathan. He played a highway ghost and was cruisin' down the road to pick up innocent hitchhikers.Since the special effects were rather lowkey and cheessy, it didn't contribute much thrill to this trip.
