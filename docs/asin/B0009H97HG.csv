905440,AFZU6XDO5L75R,B0009H97HG,"Darien Wells ""darien""","[11, 12]","This movie from 1985 was the last movie performance of Lucille Ball before her death in 1989. When it was filmed, Ball, who's early drama career became pretty much forgotten because of the name she made for herself in slapstick comedy, stated that she made this film so her public would not just remember her as a dizzy redhead. She wanted to be remembered as an actress who could play virutally any role, and that she could! This in my opinion was her greatest dramatic role. This is not the Lucy America knew as a coniving, scheming redhead who always managed to get into something she had to find a way out of. This is a whole new dimension of Lucille Ball. Grey haired, head lice, dirty, down and out with no social status, her character is a bag lady who has hit the absolute bottom living on the streets of New York City and struggling to survive. An outstanding performance on her part, in this ""made for TV"" drama. Her rendition of the bag lady Florabelle, will certainly make you stop and think about homelessness. After all, Everyone loves Lucy. When you see someone you have loved for half a century, now aged and homeless, it hits home. In addition to Lucy, Daphne Zuniga also gives a shining performance as the young social worker who sets out to get Florabelle off the streets and into a home of her own to live out what remaining years she has. The problem is that Florabelle has been on the streets for years and knows no other way of life. You will be enthrolled as you watch to see how it will all end. Very good quality all the way around. If you are a diehard Lucy fan, You HAVE to see this movie. If it's not in your Lucy collection, you don't have one.

905453,A22RZG1NQ0WAUX,B0009H97HG,Katrina L. Burchett,"[0, 0]","Florabelle (Lucille Ball) lives on the streets of New York City. She's been homeless so long that she knows where it's safe, where it's not safe and where it'll be the warmest on a cold night. She keeps to herself and doesn't want anybody in her business. She pushes around a shopping cart filled with her things and if anyone dares to touch what belongs to her that person is in for a fight. Florabelle finds companionship (although she fights against it for a while) when she meets Carrie Lang (Daphne Zuniga), but then a truth comes to light and it looks like Florabelle may be on her own once again.I usually watch shows with Lucille Ball because I know she'll make me laugh and I always appreciate a good laugh. Lately, though, I've watched classic movies she starred in and it was nice to see the dramatic roles she played in her younger days. Her performance in Stone Pillow made me laugh at times, but mostly it saddened me. I felt for Florabelle, especially when she ended up in a place she didn't choose to go. She wasn't happy about the situation and neither was I.Florabelle was a woman without an address and she had very little money but she knew how to make it on the streets. Some may have thought she was a little off but she had her right mind. In fact, she was an intelligent woman. She was a quick thinker and she knew how to get what she needed when she needed it. She was feisty and capable of taking care of herself. Florabelle was a survivor! I felt bad about her situation but I loved her spunk.Stone Pillow was heart-touching. There are definitely important lessons to be learned from watching this 1985 television movie. One lesson in particular: It is never too late to make a change.Also, I didn't realize Ana Maria Horsford (Thelma Frye on Amen may be her most remembered role; she's been acting since the 70's) was in this movie.

Not everyone realizes she was a serious actress and starred in a number of movies before making her fame as I LOVE LUCY. This is a story about age and youth, about street-wise and naivete, about someone who has no hope and someone who wants to change the world. This is a story about Florabelle, a homeless woman, who 'owns' her corner in New York City. Everything she has is in her grocery cart. The merchants on her corner know her and help her. She knows the ways of the street. She's a survivor. It's also the story of Carrie, fresh out of college in her first job as a social worker in a woman's shelter. She's told to go interact with people on the street to better understand them. She meets Florabelle who thinks she's a runaway and tries to show her the ways of the homeless. She takes her underground and into the dark world of living on the street where you survive by your wits and with some help from your friends. Lucille Ball was a great actress and she 'Carries' the day in this outstanding film about what it's like to be one of millions of people living on the street. There's nothing comic about this movie and the serious message it had back in 1985 is perhaps even more appropriate today. As someone once asked the most famous rabbi of all, 'who is my neighbor?' This film will help to define who our neighbors are. As Carrie said near the end, 'how can I stay warm when you're cold'. How do we manage to stay warm when so many are living in the cold?

Personally, I give Ms. Ball a 5 star rating all around.This movie was well-acted with excellent direction (George Schaefer) depicting homeless life on the streets of New York. It was a little slow in some respects but never lost its focus and rhythm. It starts with a young social worker (Daphne Zuniga) wanting to learn and understand the homeless to better help them. She (Zuniga as Carrie) meets Flora (Ms. Ball) who thinks Carrie is a runaway and wants to help her learn to live safely on the streets of New York. Carrie goes to extremes with Flora and they closely bond. There's more to watch and absorb from this movie but I will let you enjoy this yourself.Anyway, I got very emotional with the content of this movie and learned there is a lot more we can do to help and direct those in need to obtain services to make their lives a little bit better.

The film shows how a person can end up on the streets and what needs to be done to help those who are homeless.Lucille Ball proved she was an incredible actress in this forgotten movie. When I originally watched this I had forgotten that she was indeed the ""Queen of Comedy"", a true indication that Lucy was indeed an actress who could make her fans forget her past roles and concentrate on watching the film.Shooting took place on the streets of New York City during the summer of 1984, one of the hottest summers in the Big Apple. In order to give the role justice Lucy wore a wig that made her look less than beautiful, oversized coats that made it look like the movie took place in the winter (when it was actually shot in July) and make-up that made people not even recognize Lucy. During a break in filming Lucy went to a nearby restaurant to eat (in full makeup and clothing) and at the door she was told to leave by the staff as they thought she was a real homeless person.Immediately after filming Lucy was hospitalized with severe dehydratation as she lost 30 lbs from sweating during the intense heat. We nearly lost her.When I watch the film (which is not all that much because I do get depressed) I really have an affinity of hatred toward the producers for getting Lucy to make this movie. Knowing Lucy was well past 70 they should have never got her to do it and if they wanted her that much the filming should have been done at a cooler time of the year. Also, with the success of ""Stone Pillow"" ABC took notice as did Aaron Spelling and decided television audiences wanted Lucy back on weekly television and rewarded her with a terrible sitcom in the fall of 1986 called ""Life With Lucy"". The series was a complete flop, panned by critics and fans alike and cancelled after only a handful of episodes made it to air. When being interviewed by friend Joan Rivers on Fox's ill-fated ""The Late Show with Joan Rivers"" Lucy replied (in reference to her show being axed), ""They didn't want me anymore"".
